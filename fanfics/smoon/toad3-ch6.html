<p>Murphy’s Law</p>
<p>Dawn came to Tokyo  and found Urd, for once, awake. She lay on her bed and looked up at the mirror  above her, studying her nude form and trying to figure out what had changed. It  was puzzling.</p><p>
  She really didn’t <em>look</em> any different. Her long, tan legs were as shapely as ever, the tangle of wild  white curls on her pubis contrasting with her golden skin and emphasizing her  utter lack of tan lines. Her breasts were as full and heavy as they had always  been since she had achieved puberty and began to be able to use her goddess  powers to enhance them. Her face was just as lovely as it had been the night  before, her goddess marks accenting her wide, slightly tilted eyes and their  long lashes like always.</p><p>
  But something was <em>different.</em></p><p>
  A soft sigh drew her eyes to the golden haired form  lying beside her. Mara’s naked body was curled slightly as she snuggled against  Urd’s side, her pale skin and blonde hair contrasting nicely against Urd’s tan.  Urd found herself looking at Mara’s sensual lips and remembering how Mara had  smiled mischievously before demonstrating how talented her tongue was. She  shivered in remembered pleasure.</p><p>
  Kami, but she couldn’t remember the last time she had  felt so good after a night of fun. She usually woke up with a hangover, and  even with the few lovers she had stayed with for more than a one night stand,  she had never felt like <em>this</em>… like something  about her had been changed, something that she couldn’t quite put her finger  on.</p><p>
  She had been serious when she had told Mara she cared  for her, but couldn’t honestly call it love. She had resented the way Mara had  seemed to abandon their friendship when Urd had decided to be a goddess, but  she had never suspected it had been because her best friend had fallen in love  with her, and had been brokenhearted that Urd had made a choice that would doom  that love forever. Looking back at the years of adversarial conflict between  Mara and her and Bell, it was obvious that the demoness had never seriously  sought to cause them harm, but Urd had been too blinded by her own feelings of  betrayed anger to see the truth.</p><p>
  Guilt over all the years she had spent hating Mara’s  interference, and the realization of the depth of Mara’s feelings had prompted  her to give in to her mischievous impulse to bed the ex-demoness, but she had  certainly not expected it to be what it had turned into. Mara had expected… no, <em>hoped</em>… for little more than Urd’s  indulgence of her affections, which had been Urd’s <em>intent</em>, but Urd had found herself responding to Mara’s attentions  far more intensely than she had ever dreamed possible. She had only planned on  that one time, but over the past two days, she had found herself dragging Mara  off to bed on any excuse. Skuld had accused her of nymphomania on more than one  occasion, usually while glaring at her when she had come wandering in after one  of her all-nighters, but much as she liked sex, Urd had never actually thought  of herself as a Nympho. Mara had made her feel like one, and it had been  glorious, something she had never wanted to end. For the first time in her  life, Urd had been a slave to her own passions…</p><p>
  And here she still lay, next to an exhausted but  supremely satisfied Mara, wondering what had changed.</p><p>
  <em>I can’t be in love. This is…well…</em>different<em> than anything  I’ve ever felt before, and I know I’ve been “In Love” before. It started out so  happy and wonderful, and ended in anger and tears. I know what I’ve been  searching for and this doesn’t feel like it…</em></p><p>
  <em>…Does it?</em></p><p>
  It was like she knew that some how…some way…she had  lost something infinitely precious, something she couldn’t quite put a finger  on, but it was okay, because she had gotten something just as inexpressible,  but far more valuable in exchange. It was maddening to be so bitter-sweetly  happy for a reason she couldn’t even explain.</p><p>
  She sighed softly, and Mara muttered something  soothing in her sleep. Urd caught herself smiling. This was turning out far  better than she had feared it would be. She’d half expected it to end up like  her worst one night stand ever. She shuddered at the memory of waking up after  Peorth had kicked her out of the bed and accused her of slipping a potion in her  drink because she wasn’t a “slut half-demon lesbian” like Urd, so obviously Urd  had to be lying about who had seduced who while they had been drunk at the  Beltane party.</p><p>
  She cast an eye over to Mara’s peaceful face and  wondered if she should tell her about that. Was Peorth being so spiteful to  Mara because of it? Peorth was pretty loose about the rules of relationships  when it came to guys she liked, but a near fanatic about being heterosexual,  except when she was drunk. Was her spite due to jealously? She’d been Urd’s  biggest headache in high school, and a really annoying irritant when they had  both ended up as Sysops, but was that because Peorth harbored the same feelings  that Mara had? Or was it because Peorth hated the fact that she secretly liked  girls? Or was it due to self loathing over giving in to curiosity? Or…</p><p>
  “Getting off the subject, Urd” she muttered to  herself. She glanced over at Mara and caught herself smiling again. Funny how  she had never really thought before about how beautiful Mara’s face was. And  once again, she found herself remembering the smug grin on Mara’s face as she  looked up over the wild tangle of Urd’s curls. The memory made her hips grind  into the bed as she fought the urge to masturbate yet again.</p><p>
  Fortunately, there was a light knock against the door,  and it slid open to show Belldandy’s face.</p><p>
  “Urd, there’s- Oh!”</p><p>
  Urd smiled as Belldandy’s cheeks colored at the sight  of the two naked goddesses, but her sister regained her composure quickly. “So  sorry, But there’s a news story about to come on I think you should see.”</p><p>
  Urd nodded as she stood to grab her kimono. “Why so  shy, sister dear? You’ve seen me naked before.”</p><p>
  “Yes, but you and Mara were…umm.”</p><p>
  Urd laughed. “Yep… again. I wore the poor dear out.”</p><p>
  “You should be careful, Urd. You know Father is  keeping an eye on you and this wish. He might not be happy if you get too  distracted playing around.”</p><p>
  Urd tilted her head, a bemused look on her face.  “That’s just it, Bell.  I’m not sure it is ‘playing around’ anymore. Maybe I really am in love”</p><p>
  Bell raised her eyebrow. “The last time you said that was  just before Minstrel broke your heart.”</p><p>
  Urd rolled her eyes. “Could we <em>not</em> talk about  him?”</p><p>
  Belldandy sighed. “Alright, I just… well. Anyway,  there’s the news.”</p><p>
  “Right.”</p><p>
  They made their way to the TV for the morning news,  Urd glancing at Keiichi sitting and doing some last minute studying as he  nibbled on a piece of Belldandy’s cinnamon French toast. She had just settled  on a futon as the news announcer came back on.</p><p>
  <em>“Strange happenings last night around Tokyo. First, a small  mountain tea shop was completely destroyed last night in a fiery explosion that  could be heard for miles. The owners of the “Sexy Kunoichi Tea Shop” were  apparently killed when the teashop exploded and came crashing down on top of  them. Konatsu Kenzan, the surviving victim was just returning to the shop after  running some errands when she witnessed the explosion and claims to have seen a  small man wearing ninja garb running from the shop. According to her rather  shaky memory, when she attempted to stop the mysterious figure, the assailant  knocked her out and, supposedly, stole her panties, before disappearing into  the night. The fire started by the explosion had engulfed the shop when she had  awoken, trapping her two sisters and mother inside. Local firefighters are  dismissing her story as likely due to trauma, stating it is likely Miss Kenzan  was struck in the temple by flying debris. While the true cause of the blaze is  still being investigated, so far fire investigators have found evidence of many  poorly stored flammables and signs of a leak in the gas lines. At present, they  are attributing the fire to accidental causes, likely ignited by a cigar  recovered from the body of the eldest victim. The bodies of all three have been  recovered, and Miss Kenzan, the sole remnant of the Sexy Kunoichi clan of  female ninjas, has vowed to track down the mysterious man she claims is her  family’s killer and bring him to justice.”</em></p><p>
  <em>“Closer to home, a freak storm last  night over Tokyo  destroyed several shops in Nerima. The meteorological department is still  uncertain how the storm cells formed over the city with no warning, but the  evidence suggests that a small tornado was responsible for the early morning  havoc that left eight shops in a partial to full state of devastation. Police  have cordoned off the area and are keeping the public out of the disaster zone  while insurance investigators are assaying the damage, but one thing’s for  sure, The folks in Nerima are lucky that all the damage occurred in unoccupied  buildings, and no lives were lost. We go now to our on site reporter in  Nerima.”</em></p><p>
  The camera switched over to a nondescript reporter  standing next the tall black-haired figure of Ke Lun, dressed in a modest  kimono, her long tresses held back by a hair band that concealed the fact that  her ears were real.</p><p>
  <em>“Thank you, we are here with local shop  owner Cologne,  proprietor of the Rabbit Hutch Chinese restaurant. Miss Cologne, do you think  this disaster will affect the grand opening of your restaurant this afternoon?”</em></p><p>
  <em>“Not at all. In fact, with the crowds  that have come down to see the area, I expect we’ll have quite a turn out. I’m  quite looking forward to it.”</em></p><p>
  <em>“So, may I ask if the bunny ears are  part of your staff’s uniform?”</em></p><p>
  <em>Ke Lun smiled. “But of course. All of my  waitresses wear either bunny ears or cat ears. It’s a gimmick, but the  customers love it.”</em></p><p>
  <em>“I see, well, it’s obvious that the  businesses down here may have taken a hit, but spirits are high, and it looks  like business as normal.”</em></p><p>
  <em>“That’s right. We’re not going to let a  little storm dampen our spirits.”</em></p><p>
  <em>“And that’s our story, back to you,  Kenji!”</em></p><p>
  Urd shook her head as she turned off the TV. “Why do I  have the feeling that she went out of her way to get on TV?”</p><p>
  Belldandy sighed. “Maybe because that wasn’t a natural  storm last night?</p><p>
  Urd looked at her sharply. “What?”</p><p>
  “Well, it wasn’t. I couldn’t tell who called it up,  but someone did. I guess I should have looked into it deeper, but it wasn’t  someone supernatural. I thought it might have been something to do with that  little girl who’s trying to capture Clow Reed’s cards. It did start near the  tower, and you know she’s always kicking up a magical ruckus.”</p><p>
  “Yeah. But what reason does she have to go to Nerima?”</p><p>
  “I thought she must have been after another card, so I  went to sleep, but when I checked on it this morning, I didn’t find her  signature. I don’t know who did it, but I did recognize Ke Lun’s hand, and  another’s I think is her Loremistress’s, but the third one is a complete mystery.”</p><p>
  “And Shan Pu?”</p><p>
  “She’s fine. I checked on her this morning. Like you  predicted, she doused herself with the water.”</p><p>
  “So she’s firmly in with Akane and Ranma?”</p><p>
  “It appears so. They were all in Akane’s bed.”</p><p>
  “So shouldn’t that be the end of this idiotic wish?”</p><p>
  “Urd, you know that more than just Shan Pu is  encompassed by the wish.”</p><p>
  Urd leaned back against the wall and ground her palms  into her eyes. “I know, I know. Kami, I am so tired.” She sighed. “Dammit,  can’t I have a morning off!!”</p><p>
  The phone rang. Urd looked at it in disgust. “Great,  time for another lecture about how important this all is.” She sighed heavily  as she stood up and grabbed the receiver. “Hello.”</p><p>
  A long minute passed as Urd listened, her eyes  blinking several times before she put down the receiver and a slow, dazed smile  came over her.</p><p>
  “Urd?”</p><p>
  “Huh… Oh hi, Bell. Daddy sends his love.”</p><p>
  “But what did he say to you?”</p><p>
  “Um… well, he congratulated me on how well Shan Pu’s  wish was going, then he told me to go back to bed and snuggle with Mara”</p><p>
  “Oh… My.”</p><p>
  “Yeah… I- I guess he approves. He said that I was  doing well and that he was glad to see how happy I was with Mara.” She did a  slow blink. “He actually ordered me to go snuggle Mara?”</p><p>
  Curiously, Belldandy gave her a pleased smile. “Then  that’s what you should do.”</p><p>
  Urd gave her an evil eye. “You’ve been up to  something, haven’t you?”</p><p>
  Bell’s smile stayed as she shook her head and shoo’d Urd  towards her room. “No, I just had a thought, and Father confirmed it.”</p><p>
  Urd stopped at her door. “Do tell.”</p><p>
  Bell pushed her back into the bedroom gently. “It just  occurred to me that Shan Pu’s wish apparently encompasses <em>you</em> as well.” She slid the door shut with a giggle.</p><p>
  Urd stood for a moment absorbing that, then slid out  of her kimono and into Mara’s arms with a last thought.</p><p>
  <em>Could it be that I just have never known what love  really is?</em></p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ke Lun entered the Tendo’s dining room with a pleased  grin. “Well, that should definitely drum up some business.”</p><p>
  “I’m gonna have to wear bunny ears!?!” Ranma burst out,  fuming.</p><p>
  Ke Lun fixed her with a look. “Yes.”</p><p>
  “Man, do you have any idea how silly I’ll look!”</p><p>
  Akane elbowed him in the ribs. “What’s wrong with  rabbit ears?” she asked dangerously.</p><p>
  Ranma was learning. Other than a muttered,  unintelligible string of curses, she said nothing more about the costume.</p><p>
  Ke Lun meanwhile had turned to Soun. “We’ve repaired  the damage to Zhu Shu’s room, but I’d like permission to set up some wards  around your estate, Tendo.”</p><p>
  Soun’s shaky hands took the stub of the cigarette from  his mouth. “ Will- Will that stop another dragon from dropping in?”</p><p>
  “Yes.”</p><p>
  “Then what are you waiting for?” The edge of hysteria  was sharp.</p><p>
  “Good.” She turned to Zhu Shu, who had been trying to  remain inconspicuous. “As for you, Empress. I’m going to have to insist on  getting your promise to go nowhere alone.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded glumly. “How many warriors Zhu Shu  stuck with?”</p><p>
  Ke Lun raised an eyebrow. “I’m sorry Zhu Shu, but it’s  for your own good. And after much consideration, Lo Shen and I have decided you  shall only have one.”</p><p>
  “And I’ll try to be inconspicuous,” Lo Shen said as  she entered the dining room. This prompted a double-take from everyone since  the elder seemed to have lost even more years, and was looking all of seventeen  herself. Barely taller than Zhu Shu, her long lavender hair flowed to her  waist, and her bunny tail poked out the back of a Furinkan girl’s uniform.  “I’ve already made the arrangements for my entry to Furinkan as an exchange  student, and I’m scheduled for all the same classes, so there shouldn’t be any  problems with anyone’s classes being skipped to keep an eye on Zhu-chan.” She  fixed the trio at the end of the table. “Am I clear?”</p><p>
  They all nodded, Shan Pu looking rather put out.</p><p>
  “However,” Ke Lun cut in. “You three shall start work at  the Rabbit Hutch this afternoon, so you can help keep an eye out on Uc-chan’s  while you’re there.”</p><p>
  “Oops.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun looked at Nabiki. “Oops?”</p><p>
  Nabiki gave her a weak grin. “Uc-chan’s isn’t going to  be there much longer. I cut a deal with Ukyo last night to move and setup at  Club Nabiki. I needed a food vendor for the club, and well, you have to admit,  Zhu Shu is a big draw for the local boys. Since I can’t serve alcohol, it’s an  under 18 club, and I wanted to make sure I had plenty of customers.”</p><p>
  “Ah, yes. That bet thing that Tao-Ching has going.” Ke  Lun considered. “Well, I can’t move so easily, but if you’re willing to allow  these three to help, I suppose I can survive without their help at the Rabbit  Hutch. The twins can wait tables.” She nodded. “However, I am still going to be  taking each of you aside for further training. Much as you <em>do</em> know, there are too many gaps in your skills. Even yours Zhu  Shu.”</p><p>
  “I will be giving lessons as well,” Lo Shen added. “To  all of you, and Nabiki and Kasumi as well.”</p><p>
  Nabiki nearly choked on her fish. “Me? But I’m no  fighter.” Kasumi just tilted her head to the side expectantly.</p><p>
  “No, but then I’m not going to be teaching you to  fight.” Lo Shen said around a mouthful of her own fish. “I’m going to be  teaching you to defend yourself against some of the dark arts, such as how to  prevent your mind from being invaded. If this new enemy is truly Clove, you  will have need of such protections.” She wiped her fingers on the napkin and  looked at Nabiki pointedly. “We wouldn’t want our Empress to wake up dead  because one of you stabbed her in her sleep, yes? You remember the Musk warrior  at the village, no?”</p><p>
  Nabiki turned a little green. “Okay, okay.”</p><p>
  “What about Father and Mister Saotome?” Kasumi asked.</p><p>
  Lo Shen looked at them. “They’re not in any danger. Clove’s  compulsions require a more sophisticated mind to be effective, and your  handyman has his own protections.  A  rather interesting sort of priest he is.”</p><p>
  Soun and Genma looked relieved, oblivious to the  comment on their intelligence. </p><p>
  “However, that brings me to another point.” Ke Lun  said. “I have noticed that Ranma, Akane, and Shan Pu seem to have accepted  their various betrothals.” She looked down the table at them, where they looked  at each other, then nodded. “Good.  Because  I have been in consultation with Nodoka, and we have set the date for your  wedding.  Ranma, in one year and nine  months, you will turn eighteen, the age which you Japanese seem to consider as  the mark of an adult.  Rather silly way  to do it if you ask me, because age is no measure of maturity, but nonetheless,  it has been settled that your eighteenth birthday will be your wedding  day.   Until that day you must all give  me your oath that none of you will indulge in behavior which might dishonor  your family and tribe.”</p><p>
  Ranma blinked, “Huh?”</p><p>
  Shan Pu giggled.   “Great Grandmother mean no play with boy Ran-myah until wedding, nyah.”</p><p>
  Akane and Ranma both blushed to their hairlines.  “Um…” Ranma started.</p><p>
  Akane found her voice first.  “We had already made that decision, Great  Grandmother.  You have my oath that I  will not dishonor my family.”</p><p>
  Ranma and Shan Pu echoed her, and Ke Lun looked from  one to another, her eyebrow raised.  “I  accept your oaths.  Be aware however that  should you break it, I have access to the <em>Chisuitton</em>.  I can enforce that oath if need be.”</p><p>
  She turned to Ranma.   “As for you Son-in-law, I have a secondary reason for leaving you female  for now.  Your fight with Mu Si showed me  that you have a need to practice in your female form.  Though you would have bested him eventually,  you were less effective than you should have been.  You mis-estimated your reach, and the  different balance you have as a female, so I while I am satisfied that you have  learned your lesson in regards to Shan Pu, I will not release you from the cat  tongue until I am satisfied you have achieved equal skill with both your male  and female forms. ”</p><p>
  “What?”</p><p>
  Ke Lun smiled.   “Yes.  You are probably the most  talented student I have had since Wong Fei Hong, but you are cocky, arrogant, and  rather chauvinistic.  I blame your father  for most of these faults, but they must still be unlearned if you are to reach  your full potential.  I will train you as  I would Shan Pu, as befits a Joketsuzoku warrior, and that starts by teaching  you the true strength of the female.   Continue your sparring in the morning, and your class in the afternoon,  but I expect you to be ready to train with me at any time of my choosing.  I will not warn you when I will begin, any  more than our visitor from last night would warn you she planned to  attack.  Be aware, and be ready.”</p><p>
  Ranma grinned.   “Okay.  That is a challenge I am  definitely up for, Great Grandmother.”   She cracked her knuckles.  “Bring  it on.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun smiled as Akane reached out to pat Ranma’s head  fondly.</p>
<p>* * * * </p>
<p>Not too far away, another person watched the events  around the Tendo table and muttered in rage. </p><p>
  “Those meddlesome bitches!” Clove said in aggravation,  releasing Ukyo’s temples. The still sleeping girl had been stripped and was  currently floating above her bed, where Clove had been using her link to Zhu  Shu to look out the other girl’s eyes. Clove looked down at her and muttered a  curt phrase, allowing her to descend to her bed.</p><p>
  “You’re going to be useless. I’m sure Lo Shen will  ward you as well, since they already know about your link to that false dragon  bitch.” She leaned back in the chair. “Dammit! Those two know almost everything  about me. I’ve got to find some way of getting to her without them knowing it’s  me!”</p><p>
  She leaned forward again and put her fingers on Ukyo’s  temples, invading her mind again, and cleaning up the tell-tells of her  presence. She took one last look through the link to see that Zhu Shu seemed  unaware of her and was about to pull out when a small irregularity caught her attention.</p><p>
  Ukyo had been trying to suppress the soul link, so  Clove had been forced to break a few of her defenses before she had been able  to access it. That by itself wasn’t going to be obvious to anyone checking Ukyo.   The subconscious barriers had already  been starting to erode, and while the damage she had caused to them had made  them unlikely to survive any real emotional stresses, the worst the girl would  suffer would be a lowering of her inhibitions as her suppressed desires for Zhu  Shu worked through the link, and possibly random memories from her past  intruding in her dreams.  The soul bond  was too strong for the girl to fight anyway, as it seemed tied into her  earliest self, and the strength of the girl’s soul suggested this was not her  first incarnation.  She’d run into such  souls before and it likely meant that Ukyo was connected somehow to Zhu Shu in  a previous life. It was a common enough occurrence, though few people would  ever be conscious of such prior existences.    </p><p>
  The oddity she had almost missed was that Ukyo had  more than <em>one</em> such soul link.  At first Clove thought it was simply a  resonance effect from her spell, but as she studied the multiplicity of  ghostlike strands, she realized that the girl seemed tied to numerous other  souls, but only the bond between her and Zhu Shu was fully active.</p><p>
  She examined them  more closely, focusing on the strongest of the multiple strands.  It took her several minutes to get a firm  grip on it, and once she had, she could feel another soul resonating at the far  end, one who was as totally unaware of the link as Ukyo was.</p><p>
  It was perfect.   She could use the unknown girl to link back to Ukyo, and then through  her to Zhu Shu.  She sent a small spell  through the link to mark the unsuspecting girl, then finished erasing the  tracks of her presence in Ukyo’s mind. As she leaned back, Ukyo’s rigid body  settled into normal sleep, the glowing traces of Clove’s spell fading from her  body.</p><p>
  Clove left her there and slid out of the shop’s back  door. She took a moment to image the mark of her spell, then teleported to a  strange sight.</p><p>
  She stood at the edge of a small clearing in the  woods, the air crisp and cool, showing she had arrived somewhere in the  mountains, but also heavy with the smell of smoke. Before her was the smoldering  ruin of a building, one burned so completely that little more than ashes  remained. That didn’t seem to matter to the tattered figure before the ashes  though, since she seemed intent on making sure even those small remnants burned  completely. She was doing a little dance around one small pile, pouring  kerosene on the gathered scraps of wood, then tossing a match down while  chanting “I’m Free!!!” </p><p>
  Clove shook her head. “Great, she’s an idiot. Oh  well.”</p><p>
  The words of her freeze spell rang out across the  clearing and the red garbed kunoichi stopped mid-step. Clove stepped from under  the overhanging trees and pulled the hood off of a very pretty girl of about  sixteen, whose black hair was pulled back by two ribbons into a pony tail. A  small cherry blossom accented the red ribbons, adding it’s fragrance to her  perfume. Wide, delicately lashed eyes stared unseeingly above a pert nose and  red, red lips. Clove licked her lips.</p><p>
  “A true beauty. Perhaps once I’m done with you, I  shall keep you for a pet.” She reached out to touch the girls’ forehead, her  spells brushing through nearly non-existent defenses. A wicked smile crossed  her lips. “My, my, so subservient too. Ahh, what’s <em>this?</em>”</p><p>
  She paused, examining the traces of links in the kunoichi’s  head, noting that once again, there were multiple links, two of which carried a  familiar resonance. She quickly established which led back to a still sleeping  Ukyo, then reached for the other, laughing in malicious glee when she realized  to whom it reached.</p><p>
  But that wasn’t the only surprise she found in the kunoichi’s  mind. </p><p>
  “Oh my, what a delicious irony, my dear.” She  whispered into the kunoichi’s ear. “It seems our poor, soon to be dead false  dragon is tied to you. She will never be able to resist loving you, and through  you, I shall destroy her. The very thing she desires most will be her downfall,  and no-one will be able to save her.” </p><p>
  Mad laughter rang across the clearing as in Nerima,  Zhu Shu looked over her shoulder, a chill running down her spine.</p>
<p> * * * * </p>
<p>Peorth sat pretending to look over the morning logs  and muttering to herself. Her two subordinates were looking busy at their  posts, not giving her a chance to work out her ire on them. </p><p>
  How could Kami-Sama be turning a blind eye to what  that slut half demoness was doing! Even if she <em>was</em> his daughter? How could he not see her for what she was? And  that demoness masquerading as a goddess!!! How Urd had tricked Yggdrasil into  thinking Mara was a goddess was driving her crazy. She’d spent all weekend  trying to find proof that Urd had hacked the master computer, but had come up  blank. She’d finally ended up just staring at what she knew had to have been  Urd’s backdoor.</p><p>
  Isolated out of the rest of the datastream,  Phoenixmoon was floating serenely on one of her monitors. The sentient program’s  icon, a firebird clutching a crescent moon, wasn’t doing anything more than sitting  there, but she still had a feeling it was watching her back.</p><p>
  Could the All Father really be so blinded by love for  his daughter that he couldn’t see the demonic taint that suffused everything  Urd did? Couldn’t he see her fumbling and bumbling through a wish that should  have never been approved? </p><p>
  It was so infuriating to always come in second to an  incompetent third rater who only succeeding by being daddy’s little girl! She’d  nearly let her grades in school slip trying to match Urd’s party girl ways, and  only achieved notoriety. She’d taken to wearing skimpy clothes like Urd, only  to have been called slutty to Urd’s sexy. She’d seduced god after god, and been  called an easy lay to Urd’s “love goddess.” And she wished to Kami-sama she  could forget the horror of waking up hung-over next to the bitch!!!</p><p>
  There had to be something she could do to make Urd’s  life as miserable as she had made Peorth’s. Some way she could screw the half  demoness’s current project beyond recovery. But nothing Kami-Sama could say was  truly <em>malicious</em>. He’d been tolerant  of the mischief between the various agents of Heaven’s far reaching  bureaucracy, but he’d put his foot down at actual sabotage.</p><p>
  She was growling at her screen again when the  messenger came in. Peorth raised an eyebrow at the girl, noting her long  flowing mass of pink hair and intense blue eyes under the visor of her uniform  cap.</p><p>
  “Can I help you, Chere?”</p><p>
  The young girl seemed nervous, and Peorth felt her  heart go out to her. Probably a new soul who was not used to being around gods  yet.</p><p>
  “Um, I have a package for a Miss Peorth?” the girl  said diffidently. </p><p>
  Peorth smiled softly. “No need to be scared, mon  chere. I don’t bite. I’m Peorth.”</p><p>
  “Um, yes ma’am.” The girl gave a small curtsy. “If I  could have you sign here, please?” The request was nearly a plea in her  nervousness.</p><p>
  Peorth smiled again as she signed with a flourish.  “Relax Chere. I know heaven must be a daunting place when you’re new, but trust  me, you’ll love it here.”</p><p>
  “Thank you ma’am. I… um… it’s just so different.”</p><p>
  “Yes, but always remember, you’re among friends here.  You won’t find one person in the Relief Offices who doesn’t care passionately  about helping humanity. Even humans who have left the mortal plane.”</p><p>
  The girl gave a shy smile that seemed to light up the  entire room as she gave another curtsy and left, leaving behind the faint scent  of cherry blossoms. Peorth smiled after her. It was smiles like that that made  putting up with Urd bearable, why she had joined the Relief Offices to begin  with. Rivalries aside, there was just an indescribable feeling knowing you’d  helped someone who truly deserved divine intervention.</p><p>
  She opened the package and smiled even more broadly.  It was an assignment, one that she could handle in an afternoon, but one that  needed an experienced touch. Grant the wish of one dying old man. </p><p>
  She settled back and read over the briefing but  something on the second page caught her eye and she turned to an idle screen  and called up her researches into Urd’s wish. </p><p>
  Oh, my…</p><p>
  It was <em>perfect.</em> She could screw Urd’s assignment all to hell and all she would be doing was her  job. A little judicious coaching…</p><p>
  Behind her, unnoticed, the fiery symbol of Phoenixmoon  seemed to smile.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ukyo awoke, feeling like she had drunk way too much  sake. Gods but her head was pounding. Between that, and the lingering memories  of mad laughter in her dreams, she found herself wishing she had something  stronger than aspirin to take for the pain. She set up and groaned. What had  happened?</p><p>
  She remembered waking up during the storm to a feeling  that Zhu Shu was in danger. She had rushed out to see if she was okay, and…</p><p>
  Well, that was it. And <em>what?</em></p><p>
  She was in bed, naked, her clothes neatly folded on  the table beside her, and a massive pain in her head. She reached up to rub the  throb in her temple, and started as her hand met a bandage. She stumbled to the  bathroom and looked at herself in the mirror.</p><p>
  Okay, looked like she’d been hit with something. The  bandage was a little bloody, and her eye was turning a nice shade of black, but  other than that, she seemed to be fine.</p><p>
  So why did she feel so… unclean?</p><p>
  She examined herself as she took a shower and found no  marks anywhere else on her body, but the shower helped her feel much better,  and seemed to wash away the unseen layer of grime she thought she felt.  Afterwards, she examined her eye again and found that it was much less obvious  than she had thought, and that the cut wasn’t all that bad.</p><p>
  The alarm clock going off startled her, and she  realized she had neglected to reset it after the weekend. In a near frenzy, she  dressed and grabbed her schoolbooks as she raced towards school.</p><p>
  Halfway there, she stopped, and almost reluctantly,  cut through a side street to the path along the river, completely unsurprised  to find Zhu Shu waiting for her.</p><p>
  “Ni hao, Uc-chan.”</p><p>
  “Yeah, hi Zhu Shu. Um…” She kicked her heel before  asking. “Are you okay?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu smiled. “Yes. She hopes Uc-chan okay as well.  Great Grandmother says found unconscious after be hit by brick.”</p><p>
  Ukyo blinked. “Oh… that explains that I guess. What  happened?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu looked over Ukyo’s shoulder with a questioning  eyebrow, and Ukyo turned to see a lavender haired bunny girl trailing them by a  few feet.</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu was attacked last night by someone who has  some magical abilities, and could turn into a dragon.” The other girl said  casually. “You were lucky she missed you in the rubble. Ke Lun and I took you  home last night, though I doubt you remember it.”</p><p>
  Ukyo blinked. “Who are you?”</p><p>
  “You can call me Lo Shen. Technically, I’m Zhu Shu’s  bodyguard, but you don’t need to worry. Most of the time you won’t notice me.”</p><p>
  “Bodyguard?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded glumly.</p><p>
  Ukyo shook her head. “What, are you like rich and  never told me?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu sighed. “Is <em>much </em>worse.”</p><p>
  “What, you’re a long lost imperial princess or  something?” Ukyo chuckled. “Yeah, I could just see that. Imperial Princess  works at okonomiyaki joint.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen chuckled. “Close, my dear. Your Heartsmate is  the true Empress of China.” She tilted her head, making her ears fall to the  side. “Well, at least she would be if the true empire hadn’t fallen a thousand  years ago.”</p><p>
  Ukyo stopped. “You’re kidding!”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head. “Zhu Shu not want be empress!”</p><p>
  “Like that matters, dear.” Lo Shen said airily. “The  sooner you realize that, the easier our jobs will be, Zhu-chan.”</p><p>
  Ukyo shook her head. “Okay… well Ranma did warn me  there was more to you than you showed. An empress of a dead empire. I suppose I  can handle that considering what <em>else</em> I deal with on a regular basis.” She shrugged. “So I <em>guess</em> a full dragon isn’t that farfetched, what with you being a  dragongirl.” She did a doubletake. “Hey, wait, your clan is the Dragon. Why  would a <em>dragon</em> attack you?”</p><p>
  “If the magic user is who we think it is, she contests  Zhu Shu’s place as Heir of the Dragon.” Lo Shen supplied. “I know her of old,  and I’m at least her equal in magic, so I’m the best choice of a defender for  the two of you.”</p><p>
  Ukyo looked at her in askance. “What do you mean, the <em>two</em> of you?”</p><p>
  “As Zhu-chan’s hearts-mate, you are just as much of a  target. Zhu Shu’s enemy could attack you to get to her.”</p><p>
  “<em>I LIKE GUYS,  GODDAMMIT!</em>”</p><p>
  “You are aware of Zhu Shu’s affection for you, yes?”  Lo Shen said calmly.</p><p>
  “Of course I am. Everybody’s been going out of their  way to point it out to me, completely ignoring the fact that I’m heterosexual.”</p><p>
  “Then surely you can see how regardless of your  feelings towards her, hurting you would devastate her, no?”</p><p>
  Ukyo started to yell again, then reconsidered.  “Alright, I suppose I can see that.”</p><p>
  “Good, because I wish to teach you how to defend  yourself against this mage, so that you will not have to fear her invading your  mind.”</p><p>
  Ukyo gave her a long disbelieving look before shaking  her head. “You know, before I came to Nerima, the world made sense.”</p><p>
  “That was merely because you knew so little of it.” Lo  Shen said.</p><p>
  “Just how old are you? Somehow I just can’t see you  really being seventeen.”</p><p>
  “three hundred and eighteen.”</p><p>
  “Right… what’s one more impossible thing to believe  before breakfast.”</p>
<p>* * * * </p>
<p>Back at the Tendo’s, Kasumi was finishing dishes when  she heard a crash from the dojo. She stuck her head out of the kitchen and  called to her father in the dining room. “Father, I think I just heard a noise  in the dojo. Is Sandal working on anything in there?”</p><p>
  Soun shook his head. “No, since he’s living in them,  he’s been renovating the servant’s quarters, and went out to get some supplies.  And Genma’s here playing Go.” He looked across to the bespectacled panda.  “Better get some hot water.”</p><p>
  A quick change later and the pair were at the dojo  doors, Soun wearing a mismatched set of samurai armor, and Genma with a large  mallet he had retrieved from Akane’s room. They nodded and threw open the door,  hiding to either side in case something attacked.</p><p>
  After five minutes of nothing happening, Soun got up  the courage to peek around the door frame. He gave a shocked cry and ran into  the dojo. Genma blinked, then followed him. He found Soun looking down at the  wreckage of the family altar.</p><p>
  “An ill omen.” Soun said quietly.</p><p>
  Genma laughed. “Maybe a demon’s awakening, eh?” He  nudged Soun in the ribs.</p><p>
  Soun gave him a sidelong glance. “Demon?” Then he  chuckled. “Oh, right. ‘Demon’.” Then he did a double take. “Demon, Saotome? You  haven’t done something <em>stupid,</em> have  you?”</p><p>
  “Relax, Tendo. It’s just a joke. Sandal sealed him up  for us remember? That’s why Akane has a Chinese girlfriend?”</p><p>
  “You’re one to talk, Genma. <em>I</em> expected my  daughter to have a proper husband. <em>YOU</em> changed that, remember?” Soun  took a deep breath, then tried to take out a cigarette, only to find the pack  empty.</p><p>
  “Don’t worry about it. Sandal will clean it up and  repair it when he gets back. What say we go to the store, then check out that  new Pachinko parlor?”</p><p>
  Soun looked down at the altar again and shrugged.  “Yeah, okay. Guess I’m just edgy after having a dragon attack the house last  night.”</p><p>
  “Let the old ghoul deal with that. What we need is  some <em>serious</em> relaxation.”</p><p>
  Soun nodded. “Right. Let’s go.”</p><p>
  “Umm. Might want to lose the armor first.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>By lunch, Zhu Shu had to admit Lo Shen really was good  at being inconspicuous, at least in class. She’d taken a back seat after the  teacher had introduced her and just faded into the background for the rest of  the morning.</p><p>
  Lunchtime was another story.</p><p>
  “Did you have to set their hair on fire?” Zhu Shu  asked the Loremistress in Mandarin as they set down under her favorite tree.</p><p>
  “They’ll be fine. The spell only burns hair. They’ll  grow it back.” </p><p>
  “They really <em>are</em> harmless.”</p><p>
  Hearing an apparent seventeen year old cackle was a  little unnerving. “I know, why do you think I waited until <em>after</em> they had caught me? Get to be my age, Zhu-chan, you’ll learn  most of the fun is in being chased.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu sighed. “I just hope it doesn’t-”</p><p>
  “What’s this, Zhu Shu. Did you have to send to China for  backup?”</p><p>
  “-make you a target for Ai.” Zhu Shu finished as the  blonde cheerleader somersaulted down from the tree.</p><p>
  “Nice underwear.” Lo Shen commented, switching back to  Japanese as she looked up from the small brazier where she and Zhu Shu were  cooking.</p><p>
  Ai fixed her with a leer. “I’m not wearing any.”</p><p>
  “I know. So are you looking for a date, or do you just  want to duck over to the storage room for a quickie?”</p><p>
  Ai blinked. “What?”</p><p>
  Lo Shen gave her a knowing look. “Well, which is it?  Hot chick like you, I bet I could have some serious fun teaching you all about  how to please a woman.” She licked her lips. “So how about we just skip the  date and go straight to the sex? I’ll even bring the cuffs and collar.”</p><p>
  Ai’s mouth opened and closed a few times as she  started blushing, completely non-plussed.</p><p>
  Lo Shen was digging in her purse. “Ah,” she said,  pulling out a set of cuffs. “I even have my fur-lined ones. So tell me dear, do  you like being dangled, or spread eagled?”</p><p>
  The cheerleaders blush had spread all the way down to  her ankles. With a round eyed look at the cuffs, she gave a little gasp then  turned and fled.</p><p>
  Lo Shen looked after her with a smile. “Ah… If I was  only three hundred years younger.” She looked back to a blinking Zhu Shu.  “What?”</p><p>
  “Umm… Zhu Shu not sure that wise.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen laughed. “Maybe not, but it was fun. Don’t  worry about Miss Konjou. If nothing else, she’s more likely to take out her ire  on me than you, and I have her number. If she really gets too annoying, I’ll  play it.  She would not like the school  to know the real reason she missed most of a year of school at fifteen and is  only a second year instead of a third.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu frowned. “Blackmail is not honorable.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen chuckled. “Honor is more flexible than you’d  like to believe, Zhu Shu. Your safety is much higher on the scale than Ai’s  secrets, and I will use whatever tools are needed to insure your well being.  I’m not going to stop you if you get into another fight with her, if that’s  what you’re worried about. My only concern is making sure she doesn’t interfere  in my job. Ah, here comes your Hearts-mate.”</p><p>
  “I really wish you’d stop calling me that.” Ukyo said  as she sat down under the tree and pulled out her own small grill. “I’m not a  lesbian.”</p><p>
  “Hearts-mates are not <em>always</em> lovers, Miss Kuonji. You cannot deny that there is a bond  between you, but that does not have to mean you are more than the best of  friends.” She gave Zhu Shu’s melancholy look a shake of her head. “While I am  sure our Empress hopes for more, there is no guarantee that it will occur. You  do have free will after all.”</p><p>
  Ukyo grimaced. “You could be a little kinder to her  feelings. She’s constantly depressed enough over it as it is.”</p><p>
  “Really. Humm… and how would you know?”</p><p>
  “Umm…”</p><p>
  “Exactly.”</p><p>
  That killed the conversation for a few moments until  Ukyo sighed. “I’m sorry Zhu Shu. I-“</p><p>
  “Ukyo no have apologize. Is Zhu Shu who at fault. Not  know how to not send feelings along link.”</p><p>
  “I know. They’re just really clear today. Ever since I  felt you in danger last night, I just can’t seem to tune your feelings out.”</p><p>
  “Interesting.” Lo Shen nodded. “May I have your  permission to check within your mind for any tampering?”</p><p>
  “What?” Ukyo asked in horror. “You mean like someone  hypnotized me or something?”</p><p>
  “Or something. Clove was a master of compulsion and subconscious  mind control as well as being able to shapeshift into a dragon. Her favorite  tactic was to lay a compulsion on someone close to her enemy, then have them do  her dirty work. It took quite some time for us to learn how she was doing it,  and how to stop her. I just want to make sure you didn’t get entangled in her  clutches.”</p><p>
  Ukyo shuddered. “That sounds like one really  unpleasant person there.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen shrugged. “Actually, she wasn’t always so bad.  I’ve always thought that her rejection by the only man she ever loved played a  large part in her going a bit mad.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu looked up. “You mean Grandfather, yes?”</p><p>
  Lo Shen nodded. “Yes. Like you, dear, Clove was far  more interested in women. Shi was the only man she wanted, and she couldn’t  handle rejection.”</p><p>
  “Ouch.” Ukyo winced. “So you think she’s after Zhu Shu  because of getting dissed by her granddad?”</p><p>
  “In part. She was the daughter of a Musk Prince, who  was himself the son of a Musk Prince and a Dragon Princess. And like Zhu Shu,  she was born with jade colored eyes.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu drew in her breath as Ukyo asked, “What does  that have to do with anything?”</p><p>
  “The last Empress of China, Song Lin Tzu, also had jade  eyes, and it is through her that the Blood of the Dragon was passed into Clan  Dragon. Over the millennia since her death, daughters who have been born with  jade eyes share certain traits. One, like Zhu Shu and Clove, is that they  prefer feminine companions and lovers. Two, they all share a bond through the  Dragon’s Blood they carry with the Dragon. And three, they are all of them,  every last one, extremely powerful. Zhu Shu’s mastery of her swords is just the  tip of what she is potentially capable of, as is Clove’s mastery of magic. I  was never her match when first we fought, and while I have exceeded her in the  centuries since her death, I have no idea how powerful she might have become  since her resurrection.”</p><p>
  Ukyo leaned back against the tree. “So basically,  you’re telling me that I’ve got to be on the look out for an extremely  powerful, mind controlling mage who wants to hurt me just because of the crush  Zhu Shu has on me?” She shook her head. “And you want to use the exact same  magical tricks on me just to make sure she hasn’t already bewitched me?”</p><p>
  “Yes.”</p><p>
  “And if I said I didn’t want you rummaging through my  mind?”</p><p>
  “Then you leave yourself open to control.”</p><p>
  Ukyo buried her face in her hands. “You know, I just  came over here to offer a cooking lesson to Zhu Shu.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu smiled. “You show make okonomiyaki!?”</p><p>
  “I was.” She shook her head. “Gods I wish that blonde  ditz student of yours had never told me where to find Ranma. My life has been  nothing but problems ever since.” Ukyo took a deep breath. “Alright, I guess…  Do your mumbo jumbo.”</p><p>
  “I hardly do ‘<em>mumbo  jumbo</em>’, dear.” Lo Shen said as she reached out to touch Ukyo’s temple.</p><p>
  There was a feeling like a cold shiver, then Ukyo  found herself standing in a featureless white void.</p><p>
  “What, the hell?”</p><p>
  “Just an antechamber.” Lo Shen said from beside her.  “A kind of mental room just outside your mind. I figured you’d want to  accompany me, and make sure I wasn’t up to any tricks.” </p><p>
  Ukyo nodded. “Okay. So why does this place look like  the entrance to the Matrix?”</p><p>
  “It’s your mental imagery, not mine, dear.”</p><p>
  “Do you have to call me ‘dear’?”</p><p>
  Lo Shen laughed as she reached out and opened a door  in mid air. “Old habit.” She closed her eyes for a second, and suddenly she was  an ancient woman with long, almost white hair. The faintest tint of lavender  could still be seen as it hung almost to the ground. Ukyo noted that it would  have if she hadn’t been balancing on a stick like…</p><p>
  “I get it. You’re an Amazon elder like Ke Lun.”</p><p>
  “Took you this long? I must be slipping.” She motioned  at the doorway. “Shall we?”</p><p>
  Ukyo looked at the blank doorway, then shrugged.  “Sure, why not, can’t get any crazier than this, right.” She stepped through  the blankness and stopped.</p><p>
  She stood on nothing before a vast gulf of emptiness,  staring at herself in a mirror… and yet not herself. She was…</p><p>
  “Beautiful…” she whispered.</p><p>
  “Yes. That is your soul, Ukyo, your essence.  Everything that you are, or will ever be, your uttermost being is there. What  you are seeing is your purest form.”</p><p>
  Ukyo looked at the enchanting vision before her, and  tried hard not blink. It really <em>was</em> her, looking exactly the same as she did in any mirror, but on the vision  before her, that slightly too thin nose, those not quite high enough  cheekbones, and that not quite pouty enough mouth… they all combined into the  ultimate vision of loveliness. No one could look at <em>that</em> Ukyo and not be  entranced. She was quite simply the most beautiful woman Ukyo had ever seen.</p><p>
  And there was no doubt anywhere that she was indeed a  woman. Ukyo could not have described a single item of clothing that she wore,  but it left no doubt about her femininity. It could have been an evening gown,  or a miniskirt, or her everyday outfit, but whatever it was, it subtly  emphasized her shapely bustline, and showed off the curves of her hips. It left  her feeling breathless, almost faint, like a hot wind poured forth from the  figure before her.</p><p>
  “You see now what Zhu Shu sees every time she looks at  you.” Lo Shen said from beside her. “But this is merely the surface. We need to  focus on a specific aspect of your subconscious.”</p><p>
  Ukyo forced herself to stop looking at the mirror.  That was just a little too intense a piece of knowledge. <em>This is how I look  to her?</em> “So, how do we do that?” </p><p>
  Lo Shen nodded. “Good. Want to do it yourself. I like  that.” She cracked her knuckles. “Okay, before we go in, I want to take a  moment and teach you how to make a shield against anyone trying to do what  we’re doing.”</p><p>
  Ukyo chuckled. “Okay, since that is something I very  much want to make happen, what do I do?”</p><p>
  “Close your eyes and think about forming a wall, a  solid shell of force that completely surrounds you.”</p><p>
  Ukyo complied and in a few moments nodded.</p><p>
  “Next, you must envision the ki within you, feel the  energy of it flowing through you.”</p><p>
  After another few moments Ukyo nodded, her motions  slow and precise, showing she’d entered a meditative state. </p><p>
  Lo Shen smiled. “Good, you’ve had some training. Zhu  Shu said you were a good martial artist. Now the last thing you must do is  allow your ki to flow into the wall you conceived.”</p><p>
  Ukyo frowned. “Won’t that sever the flows of ki?”</p><p>
  “You’re far too much of a novice to do that, dear.  Cutting someone’s lifeforce off takes deliberate will, and far more knowledge  and skill than I have time to teach you. Your subconscious will not allow you  to kill yourself that way.”</p><p>
  With a shudder, Ukyo tried to follow Lo Shen’s  instruction, then stopped with a gasp.</p><p>
  “Try to relax, dear. The flows feel so intense because  your consciousness is on the same plane as your soul. Just allow them to flow  into the barriers you want created.”</p><p>
  Ukyo shuddered again, then took a deep breath. She  drew the energy in through her feet and allowed it to flow out of her head and  cascade down around her in a glowing wall of blue neon. “Okay.”</p><p>
  “Very good. Now for the last part, you must release  the wall to your subconscious, you have to <em>know</em> that it is there, in the back of your head, even when you aren’t <em>thinking</em> about it.”</p><p>
  Ukyo opened her eyes to give Lo Shen a puzzled look,  then she drew in a sharp breath.</p><p>
  The neon wall she had visualized hovered around her,  lighting the darkness with a brilliant blue glow. Small eddies swirled and  played across its surface like smoke illuminated by a laser. She blinked  several times, but the wall remained.</p><p>
  “Not <em>usually</em> what I’d recommend,” Lo Shen said with a smile. “But direct visual proof works  just as fine as belief. The secret to all magic is to know yourself, Ukyo. The  same self confidence you have as a martial artist, the same will to improve  your skills, drives the Universe around you just as easily as it drives your  flesh.  At our deepest core, we are all  simply parts of the Grand Unity. Every one of us is a piece of god. All we have  to do is realize it.”</p><p>
  Ukyo raised her eyebrow. “And that means what?”</p><p>
  Lo Shen laughed. “It means that there is no spoon.”</p><p>
  “Cute.”</p><p>
  “It also basically means that the shield is only as  strong as you <em>think</em> it is.”</p><p>
  “Okay, now that is useful information.” Ukyo grimaced.  “Think Adamantium!” she told herself.</p><p>
  Lo Shen nodded. “Well done.  I would normally go into a lecture at this  point about how the energy you just used is technically youki as opposed to ki,  but we really don’t need to split that many hairs.  Just be aware that you possess both the  physical flows of ki as well as the spiritual flows of youki, and that your  subconscious will automatically use the appropriate one as needed.  As you’re not my apprentice, I’ll spare you  the hour long dissertation.”</p><p>
  Ukyo chuckled.   “Thank you.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen smiled and waved a hand at the mirror.  “Now, we go check to see if Clove has been up  to anything.”</p><p>
  The world around them did a whirl and dive as they  seemed to fly right through the mirror into a world of webs. Lightning crawled  along the strands that criss-crossed in every direction. Ukyo nearly cried out  as they executed a tight loop around several strands.</p><p>
  “Man, if they could make a roller coaster like this,  I’d never leave the park!” she said excitedly as they performed another stomach  churning roll.</p><p>
  Lo Shen chuckled. “It’s different for every mind,  child. Welcome to your consciousness, the actual energy patterns that course  through your brain with every thought. We’re headed for that central cluster up  ahead, your subconscious.”</p><p>
  Ukyo blinked. “That’s huge!”</p><p>
  Lo Shen nodded. “Far more of our mind is subconscious  than conscious, dear. It’s the center of our existence. It runs our bodies,  monitors our dreams, and connects us to the larger universe. It is the question  wrapped in mystery shrouded in enigma that lies at the heart of who we are.”</p><p>
  “You’re philosophizing again, old woman.”</p><p>
  “Only because there is no other way to describe it.”  She pointed to a spot near the bottom of the mass. “There. See that shaft of  gold that shoots straight off into infinity?”</p><p>
  Ukyo blinked as a strange shift in perspective took  place and suddenly she was standing next to the no longer gigantic mass holding  the thread and looking at herself sitting comfortably under the tree in front  of Lo Shen. But it was like she was seeing double, seeing herself and the image  she had seen in the mirror imposed on top of each other and on top of that she  saw…</p><p>
  She blinked at the vision of herself inside herself  looking at herself through Zhu Shu’s eyes. She rubbed her eyes. “That was  weird”</p><p>
  She looked up again, and realized that the world had  changed once more. She stood in the heart of a cherry grove at twilight, before  a stone archway into nothingness.</p><p>
  “Konichiwa, my Lady Guardian.” A voice said from  behind her, and she turned to see a pretty girl with long pink hair and  intensely blue eyes. Without a doubt, she realized she knew exactly who the  girl was.</p><p>
  “You’re Zhu Shu’s dead girlfriend.”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying nodded. “Technically, yes. But I’m not  really dead. More like suspended between life and death.” She nodded at the  archway. “I guard the door.”</p><p>
  Ukyo blinked. “How did I get here?”</p><p>
  “You followed the strands that connect us all, my  love.”</p><p>
  Ukyo gave her a sharp look. “Not you too.”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying shrugged. “I too am bound within the web. I  cannot love Zhu Shu without loving you all. It’s who we are. However, we  haven’t much time.”</p><p>
  “Time for what?”</p><p>
  “To give you a warning. Things are about to occur that <em>must</em> occur, and you alone hold the  key to life or death for your world - for all worlds.”</p><p>
  Ukyo blinked. “<em>What?</em>”</p><p>
  “You have a choice to make, my Lady. I can tell you no  more. Only that your choice will save or damn us all.”</p><p>
  “You can’t just drop something like that on me and not  give me more information!”</p><p>
  “I wish I could, my love. But I know nothing else. Not  even the All Father knows what will happen. Only that it will come, and that  you alone can save us all. We each of us have our destinies, our reasons for  being bound together. That is all I know.”</p><p>
  “But how can I save the world?”</p><p>
  “I do not know, my Lady. Only that it is something you  alone can do.”</p><p>
  “But… but what about that other person that Zhu Shu is  connected too? Why do I-“</p><p>
  “Because their part has not yet begun. Only if you  choose correctly will they enter the field. Only if we survive the coming test  will the final act commence.” Ying-Ying looked sheepish. “I’m sorry for this, beloved,  but Lo Shen is about to pull you back.”</p><p>
  “Sorry for what?”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying stepped close before Ukyo realized what she  was up to. “For sealing your memory of this until the proper time.” She  whispered as she stood on tip toes to kiss Ukyo.</p><p>
  It was like a fiery river of ice coursing through her  body as their lips touched, a liquid fire so intense it went beyond heat,  beyond thought, beyond consciousness, and for just one eternal moment, she  stood naked before the vast eyes of the Dragon and knew she was loved…</p><p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;But not for the kiss, my  beloved-…&gt;&gt;</em></p><p>
  “-Ukyo!”</p><p>
  Lo Shen’s voice was concerned. Ukyo blinked. “Yeah?”</p><p>
  “Are you alright, child? You blanked out on me for a  second.”</p><p>
  Ukyo blinked. “Sorry, I was looking at myself setting  under the tree. I guess I was looking out of Zhu Shu’s eyes.”</p><p>
  “Ah. I should have anticipated that. It’s quite an  experience seeing ourselves as another sees us. I can remember when I did that  with my first husband…” Lo Shen blushed. “Well, maybe you’re just a little  young for the rest of that story.”</p><p>
  “I’m not a complete innocent, you know.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen cackled. “Dear, compared to me, everyone’s  innocent.” She hopped over to point out another thread. “Anyway, this is what  we came to see. This is the resonance from the healing spell I cast earlier.  It’s the most recent external trace before our coming. It’s not conclusive  proof, but Clove has a habit of leaving nasty little traps, and I’ve found no  evidence of any. There is some disarray, but that most likely is from the mild  concussion you had when we found you.”</p><p>
  Ukyo blinked. “Um… okay. Looks like any other thread  here save this gold one.”</p><p>
  “Yes, but don’t look at it, feel it.”</p><p>
  Ukyo looked down at the gold strand in her hand, oddly  reluctant to let it go. When she did, she noted it separated into multiple  separate strands before re-twining around itself. Following Lo Shen’s example,  she touched the silver strand.</p><p>
  “Oh.” She said, surprised. “I see what you mean. It  just feels different.  Like – like… well  like <em>you</em> to be blunt.”</p><p>
  “Yes. Because it’s not part of you. Like I told you  earlier, know thyself.” Lo Shen waved her stick around at the tangled mass  around her. “Once you know yourself, intrusions are as obvious as someone  holding up a sign and shouting ‘I’m here!’   You know me, since I am the one guiding you, so you recognize my  personal signature.”</p><p>
  Ukyo nodded. “I think I get you.” She snorted. “You  know, I’ve always thought that magic was this enormously difficult thing to  learn.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen rolled her eyes. “People from Buddha to Christ  to Deepak Chopra have been trying to tell people how easy it really is. The  trouble is no-one listens.  Your will  determines your success.”</p><p>
  Ukyo found herself once more under the tree next to  Zhu Shu as she broke out laughing. “I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve  told that to people who don’t want to push their martial arts to the next  level.”</p><p>
  “It’s very much the same thing, child. Discipline and  will. Besides, you both already do magic.”</p><p>
  “Huh?”</p><p>
  “Really, what did you think you were doing when you  hide something in that ‘other place’ behind your back?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu blinked, then broke out in giggles, and Ukyo  couldn’t help but join in.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Nabiki nodded approvingly at the door of the Hibiki  estate. She had decided on a whim to stop by after school, thinking it would be  the first time she had gone to see her eventual home.</p><p>
  Home?</p><p>
  Strange as it was to think that of someplace other  than the dojo, Nabiki liked the sound of it. Welcome to the home of Nabiki  Hibiki.</p><p>
  “At least it rhymes,” she muttered to herself with a  grin as she rang the doorbell.</p><p>
  The door opened immediately to reveal a smartly  dressed elder gentleman. “Ah. Greetings, Miss Tendo. Please do come in.”</p><p>
  Nabiki blinked. “Um… how do you know my name?”</p><p>
  “I made a point of learning the face and name of my  grandson’s fiancée, Miss Tendo. It would be terribly rude of me to turn away  the young lady who has captured his heart. My name is Muhashi Hibiki, but you  can call me Grandfather.”</p><p>
  Nabiki blinked. “Um… Thank you.” She said, quite taken  off guard. “I hope I’m not intruding?”</p><p>
  “Certainly not. In fact, you have wonderful timing. I  was just about to send for my limo to come see <em>you.</em>”</p><p>
  Nabiki blinked again. “Oh… um…”</p><p>
  “It’s nothing bad, I assure you, Miss Tendo. Simply a  small discussion, information on the Hibiki clan that you must be aware of if  you are to wed my Grandson. Would you care to join me for tea in the garden?”</p><p>
  He was such a gentleman that Nabiki couldn’t help but  like him, against all her normal inclinations. “Please, call me, Nabiki,  Grandfather.”</p><p>
  He led the way through a hallway to an enclosed garden  filled with sakura and a small gazebo. After pulling out her chair for her, he  ordered tea for two on a small intercom panel, then sat and gave her another  smile.</p><p>
  “I’m sure you must have noticed my grandson’s lack of  a sense of direction.” He asked without preamble.</p><p>
  Nabiki blinked, but nodded.</p><p>
  “I must ask that what I am about to tell you not be  taken lightly, Nabiki. It is a vast wound to Hibiki pride, a stain upon our  honor we have never been able to erase. It is something you must consider  carefully before you accept Tao-Ching’s hand in marriage.”</p><p>
  Nabiki gulped. “Okay. I thought you said it wasn’t  bad.”</p><p>
  “Yes, in truth it is a matter of perspective. It is  only bad if you become a Hibiki.” The old gentleman sighed deeply. “The only  reason I could lead you to this gazebo is because I have spent my entire life  inside this house. Had we been anywhere else, it would have been a feat beyond  my capacity. You see, we Hibiki’s have the sad ability to become lost in a  closet.”</p><p>
  Nabiki couldn’t help the small giggle.</p><p>
  The elder Hibiki gave her a small smile. “Before  laughing, my dear, you must be aware that should you wed Tao-Ching, the curse  will strike you as well.”</p><p>
  Nabiki blinked, her laughter gone. “It will?”</p><p>
  “Yes.” He looked up as a kimono clad young woman  brought in a tea tray. “Ah, our tea is here. Miss Anami, this is Miss Tendo,  Tao-Ching’s Fiancée. Miss Tendo, our housemaid, Miss Anami. If you ever need  assistance finding your way around the house, please feel free to use any  intercom and she will come to guide you.”</p><p>
  “Yes ma’am.” The housemaid bowed. “I know the house  like the back of my hand, and can tell you where either of the masters are at  any time.”</p><p>
  “Miss Anami and her family have served our house since  before the curse. We would truly be utterly lost with out them.” He gave the  housemaid a small bow. “Thank you, my dear.”</p><p>
  “You’re welcome, sir. If you need anything else, just  call.”</p><p>
  Nabiki reflected that there was very little of  superiority in the elder Hibiki’s attitude with the housemaid, and much of a  doting grandparent. It was a far cry from how she’d seen Kuno treat Sasuke, and  for some reason, it made her feel guilty for her dreams of a mansion full of  servants catering to her every whim. It made her feel somehow inferior.</p><p>
  As she sipped her tea, he continued. “Long ago, during  the Sengoku era, the Hibiki Clan was founded when our ancestor, Jiyo Hibiki  defeated one of the okami clans and took their princess to be his bride. Strengthened  with the blood of the wolf youkai, we were renowned as fierce fighters and  wandered all of Japan,  free Samurai who sought out evil to vanquish wherever we roamed. We were one of  many such clans who fought against the youkai who threatened man on every side,  but we understood that not all youkai were truly evil. Our youkai heritage made  us strong, and our school demanded that we temper ourselves by standing against  injustice. The teachings of the School of One Righteous Blow have been lost to  us, but they were both our strength and our downfall.”</p><p>
  He took a sip of tea, and Nabiki could see just a  small shake of his hands as he set the cup back down.</p><p>
  “We wondered the land, and our name was praised from  one end of Japan  to the other until the day we encountered the youkai Naraku.”</p><p>
  Nabiki couldn’t have said why, but a shudder ran down  her spine that made icy spikes in her belly. She could not remember ever having  heard a name that left such a feeling of darkness and despair in her, a name  that felt almost too vile to even utter. The intonation the elder Hibiki gave  the word for the Abyss of Hell carried such a sense of dread that even the  light seemed momentarily dimmed.</p><p>
  “Our patriarch, Mihu, fought against him alone and  lost, and he was a mighty fighter, the only warrior to stand against the youkai  assassin Sesshomaru and live, though it cost him his left eye. As a Clan, a  thousand strong, we rode out to avenge our father and regain the Hibiki family  sword <em>Burekaishi</em>.” </p><p>
  The old man was staring off into the distance, lost in  the past.</p><p>
  “We tracked Naraku his lair and fought our way through  his hordes, killing twenty demons for every man we lost, and finally, five  hundred of us won through to the heart of the fortress.  And we wept, for before us, Naraku sat upon  his throne, the mutilated body of our father naked and gutted upon the wall  behind him, <em>Burekaishi</em> piercing his  breast.”</p><p>
  “Naraku laughed at our tears, and pronounced his  curse. Wandering warriors we were, and wondering warriors we would ever be,  never to know our way, or where our footsteps would lead us, and as we charged  him, a great darkness swept over us, and the fortress was gone, and our clan  was scattered to the four winds.”</p><p>
  Tears were running down his face now as he finished.  “And from that day to this, all who bear the name Hibiki have born this curse,  and shall until we have redeemed our honor and regained the family sword.”</p><p>
  Nabiki put down her cup of tea, trying to still the  thumping of her heart. To be eternally lost.</p><p>
  “Does Tao-Ching know about this?”</p><p>
  The old man shook his head. “He doesn’t believe. The  curse clouds more than just our sense of direction.” He pointed to a small  object lying on a bench just outside the gazebo. “Would you be so kind as to  fetch me that compass?”</p><p>
  Nabiki did so, noting that it was a very expensive  model, fully set up for orienteering. “Here you are, sir.”</p><p>
  She stopped and stared. The needle was spinning  wildly.</p><p>
  “Tao-Ching was raised as an Amazon not because he was  abandoned, child. Like so many of our clan, he was simply <em>lost.</em> He wondered out of the mansion and ended up in China. My son  and his wife left to find him and have never returned. I myself was once  foolish enough to leave this house alone and could not find my way back for six  years. We do not travel in straight lines, or even in straight space. Some of  us can cross continents in the space of a few steps. Were it not that those  places to which we have formed strong attachments call to us, I fear that not a  Hibiki would be left in Japan.”</p><p>
  “So that’s how he manages to eventually get to the  dojo.”</p><p>
  “Yes. My Grandson is still half savage, but he does  care for you a great deal.”</p><p>
  Nabiki nodded. “And if I marry him, I’ll have the  curse too?”</p><p>
  “From the moment you make your vows.”</p><p>
  Nabiki nodded. “Then I guess there’s only one choice,  Grandfather.”</p><p>
  The old man sighed and nodded. “I fully understand.  Perhaps it would be best if I voice an objection, so that he will think it is  simply my being an obstinate old man.”</p><p>
  “No, Grandfather. You misunderstand. I don’t back down  from a challenge. It’s not something we Tendo’s know how to do. I mean to find <em>Burekaishi</em>.” Nabiki said firmly.</p><p>
  The old man was speechless.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Tao-Ching hadn’t practiced with his zanbatou in years,  and it showed.</p><p>
  He picked up the massive sword from where he had  dropped it, the seven foot long blade dwarfing his 5’8” frame, but moving as  lightly as a katana in his grip. He resumed his stance, placing his hands  properly on the hilt, and began the kata again.</p><p>
  He blanked his mind and allowed his muscles to remember  reflexes honed over a decade under his mothers tutelage, the massive blade  whining through the air as he twirled it in an ever faster spin. The steps were  beginning to resume some of their old fluidness as he let his mind roam back to  the research he had taken a break from.</p><p>
  The ancestral swords he had been charged with  returning set in a sword rack above his computer, off to the side of his  combination workroom-dojo, an ever present reminder of his duty. He didn’t  regret his actions. Killing Herb had been necessary, but he had known there  would be repercussions. It had been doing the right thing rather than following  orders that had gotten him kicked out of the JSDF too. He might have developed  his own taste for divesting nubile ladies of their clothes, but that was a far  cry from standing by and allowing a Colonel to rape the dancer hired for an  officers party, even if the Colonel was the brother of a party leader and his  superior officer. Hell, he’d even gone easy on the guy, a broken jaw and all  four limbs snapped cleanly was far less than he <em>could</em> have done.</p><p>
  The zanbatou was nearly silent now, as his training in  using the air around his blade instead of fighting it returned. His muscles  burned with the effort, but he ignored them. Their soreness was the price for  regaining his center. <em>Give and take, ebb  and flow, for all things there is a price, what are you willing to pay to  achieve your goals?</em> He could almost hear Rin Se repeating the patter as he  went into a sequence of strikes.</p><p>
  The problem was too many records had been destroyed  between the Shogunate and the War. Only one of the swords had even been  identified to a Clan, the Hasai, but records were spotty. Some indicated their  collapse as a House before the Tokugowa regime even assumed power, following a  skirmish with another house that had struck a deal with the Dutch traders for  weapons and aid from one of their Black Ships. There were indications that  various branches of the family survived, but it was unclear if the main line  the sword belonged to had survived.</p><p>
  He used the point of his blade to toss one of the  thick logs he had stacked to the side of the dojo into the air, keeping it  airborne as he cut chunks out. He wasn’t even paying much attention to what he  was carving, the effort of moving the massive blade fast enough to keep the log  steady in the air consuming most of his concentration. Rin Se had called it a  carnival stunt, but he’d once been really good at whittling and not even Rin Se  had been able to match his precision with the huge weapon.</p><p>
  “My god, you’re glowing.”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching grinned. “Hi Nabi-chan. I take it Granddad  grabbed you for a chat. Probably warned you how dissolute of character I am and  how try as he might to civilize me, I’m still a savage?” he asked, not letting  his concentration on moving the weapon lapse.</p><p>
  Nabiki settled into his computer chair. “Well he did  use the word savage in describing you, but other than that, he spoke quite  highly of you.”</p><p>
  “Humm. That’s a change. Most of my elders don’t have  much praise for me.”</p><p>
  “You know you look a lot like that guy from Final  Fantasy with that thing.”</p><p>
  “You mean Cloud Strife? Yeah. The guys in the JSDF  teased me so much about it I actually stopped working out.” With a last strike,  he caught the remains of the log on the end of the blade and held it out to  Nabiki.</p><p>
  “Ohhh. Nice sculpture, but I’m afraid my body isn’t  quite so well proportioned.”</p><p>
  “Well, maybe if you got undressed and posed…”  Tao-Ching leered as he leaned against his sword, the glow of his chi fading.</p><p>
  “Hentai,” Nabiki offered affectionately. </p><p>
  “Damn straight.” He smiled. “So did you come by on  your own, or did Granddad invite you over?”</p><p>
  “How’d you know I was here?”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching pointed at the monitor behind her, and she  turned to see a small window with a view of the entrance to the Hibiki estate.  “I always check who’s ringing my doorbell. When Miss Anami didn’t bring you  straight back, I figured Granddad had waylaid you.”</p><p>
  “Is that why you were working out?”</p><p>
  “No, although I <em>was</em> hoping you’d get back here while I was still practicing.”</p><p>
  Nabiki smiled. “Ohhh. I like a man who wants to show  off his body for me.” She tossed him a towel. “But what if I told you I had  developed a taste for women too?”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching laughed. “You live with Zhu Shu. I’d be more  shocked if she hadn’t rubbed off. Between her and my cousin, you never had a  chance.  You’d look just as tasty to both  of them as you do to me.”</p><p>
  Nabiki laughed. “True, but it wasn’t either one of  them.”</p><p>
  “They both jumped you?”</p><p>
  “Nope. Shan Pu’s been occupied with her Ai Ren’s, as I  believe she calls them, and Zhu Shu has been moping over Ukyo. No, I’m afraid I  was forced to collect on a promise made by the one who did the most to drive me  crazy enough to nearly rape you on the front lawn when I was stuck as a bunny  girl.”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching laughed. “Don’t tell me it was Akane?”</p><p>
  “Wrong sister.”</p><p>
  “To steal a quote, oh my. So how was she?”</p><p>
  “She’s quite a tigress in bed. Rather surprising.  I couldn’t even move the next morning.”  Nabiki gave him an evil grin. “Not even the <em>tiniest</em> bit jealous?”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching rolled his eyes. “Please Nabiki. I grew up  in the Amazon village, remember? We had a five to one ratio of girls to guys.  And most everybody is <em>somebody’s</em> relative. Shall we suffice it to say that I’ll bow to your discretion on the  subject of Sister-Wives?” </p><p>
  “Too steal a quote, damn straight.” </p><p>
  “So what brings you by? Being Amazon, I’m not going to  pull the usual male assumption that you’re looking for sex.”</p><p>
  “I <em>wasn’t.</em> Changed my mind to ‘haven’t decided’ when I was watching you practice though.”  She gave him a wicked grin. “I’ll let you know.”</p><p>
  “Meanie.”</p><p>
  “Yep. I actually came by to let you know that Club  Nabiki will open Friday. I’ve gotten Ukyo to move her restaurant inside, and  apparently have four extremely cute waitresses on staff as of Ke Lun’s orders this  morning.”</p><p>
  “You’re quick and efficient. Good.”</p><p>
  Nabiki smiled. “I also came by to thank you for trying  to help last night.”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching shrugged. “I’d be a poor Amazon if I had  stood by while those I care about are in danger, Nabi-chan. That’s why we learn  to fight… no… it’s the <em>only</em> reason we  fight, Nabiki. To protect the ones we love.”</p><p>
  “I know, Tao-Ching.” She smiled, but left the rest  unsaid.</p><p>
  <em>And that’s why I’m going to fight for you.</em></p><p>
  She stepped up to him and  encircled his neck with her arms.  “Now…  about that other thing…”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ukyo was really looking forward to getting home, and  opening up shop. She was feeling bouncy. Weird really. She just had this sense  of happiness following the impromptu magic lesson with Lo Shen.</p><p>
  It was probably because Lo Shen had told her she was  an excellent student. Praise from anyone had always been a commodity in short  supply, let alone from someone like Zhu Shu’s guardian.</p><p>
  “Ukyo seem bubbly.” Zhu Shu commented from beside her. </p><p>
  Ukyo nodded. “I guess I just feel like I made an  accomplishment. I mean, I’ve worked hard for everything I have. Dad might be a  multimillionaire, but I’ve never asked for his money. I’ve built what I have by  my own two hands, learned what I have on my own. Having someone who is as  knowledgeable and powerful as Lo Shen offer me respect for what I’ve  accomplished…”</p><p>
  “Ukyo should have pride in self.” Zhu Shu smiled. “Zhu  Shu think Ukyo very good role model. Very independent and brave.”</p><p>
  Ukyo blushed. “Compliments like that have been very  rare for me since Genma ruined my life. I’m more used to being told how useless  I am because I couldn’t even hold on to my fiancé. I guess I just gave up on  expecting anyone to ever notice if I did well.”</p><p>
  “You deserved the compliment, Miss Kuonji. Were you  willing to devote your life to it, you could be quite the accomplished  sorceress.” Lo Shen volunteered from behind them. “However, it seems you have  guests.”</p><p>
  Ukyo turned to look and noticed the limo in front of  her shop for the first time. Her happy feeling fled as a familiar stale lump  invaded her belly. She grimaced. “What the hell does he want <em>now?</em> I told him I could never marry  Ranma and why. I even told him where to take his inheritance and shove it.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu gave her a concerned look. “Uc-chan? Is okay?”</p><p>
  “Yeah, I just hate it when Dad drops in unexpectedly.”</p><p>
  She nodded at the chauffeur, who gave her an  apologetic smile. “He’s a bit upset with you, Miss Ukyo.”</p><p>
  “I’m not sure I really care anymore, Kensuki-san.”</p><p>
  “Just providing fair warning, Ma’am.”</p><p>
  “Appreciated.”</p><p>
  Ukyo turned to the others. “You can wait out here if  you prefer.”</p><p>
  Lo Shen produced a canteen that steamed when she  opened it and returned to her true form. “Perhaps a grey head will help  mitigate things a bit, dear.”</p><p>
  “I’m just gonna tell him I’m done playing his games,  and that in a year and a half, he’s free of me.”</p><p>
  “I understand the sentiment, child, but you are <em>still</em> his daughter.”</p><p>
  “I didn’t say I wouldn’t be <em>nice </em>about it.” Ukyo sighed as she pushed open the door.</p><p>
  The beard was more neatly trimmed, and he wore a  business suit these days, but that disapproving scowl hadn’t changed from the  day Genma had hightailed it over the horizon. He was sitting at one of the  tables with a large gift package on the floor.</p><p>
  “Son,” he said in a cold greeting.</p><p>
  “Come on, Dad. Can’t you drop it? I’m your <em>daughter,</em> for kami’s sake!”</p><p>
  “You’re a disappointment, <em>son</em>, but you’re all I have. I’ve given you your chance to redeem  yourself and you have failed. I’m putting an end to this farce.”</p><p>
  Ukyo felt the stale feeling turn to spikes of ice, and  her eyes locked on the package. “Oh, gods… <em>NO!</em>”</p><p>
  “Ukyo, I would like you to meet your fiancée.”</p><p>
  The package exploded into ruffles and lace as Ukyo  reached for her battle spatula too late. The curly brown haired figure gave a  girlish giggle before a high pitched squeal of delight.</p><p>
  “Ukyo! <em>Darling!</em>”  was all she heard before the feminine figure glomped her and she found herself  engulfed in a passionate kiss.</p><p>
  “Miss Tsubasa Kurenai.” The elder Kuonji finished.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu and Lo Shen facefaulted…</p>
