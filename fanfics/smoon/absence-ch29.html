Makareus eyed the pink-haired bundle with trepidation from where he 
stood in front of his desk. *This* was a Sailor Senshi? He found that 
very hard to believe. The grey-suited man raised an eyebrow dubiously as 
the human child continued to struggle in her bonds, glaring daggers at 
him. The youma restraining the human drew his arms tighter around her 
body, in an effort to secure the wriggling mass. Makareus had never 
liked children, and especially human children. The demon had been forced 
to gag the captured &#39;senshi&#39;; there were only so many threats and 
screaming one could take. Apparently, according to the child, the other 
Sailor Senshi were going to rescue her and then &#39;really, really, whale 
on him, big time&#39;. At that point Makareus had shoved a wad of cloth in 
the annoying creature&#39;s mouth, ceasing the cacophony and giving all the 
occupants of his office some peace.

&quot;Are you completely sure this is a Sailor Senshi?&quot; Makareus asked the 
assassin again, while not taking his gaze off the prisoner. The youma 
guard holding the human winced as she kicked him in the shins 
repeatedly, her heels drumming a beat on his bones.

&quot;Yes, Lord Makareus,&quot; the black-clad youma assured the demon.

Makareus let out a stress-filled sigh and closed his eyes, banishing the 
irritating little human from his sight. The attacks on the Sailor Senshi 
had not gone entirely according to plan. Usually the Silent Blades were 
very reliable, but so far only one member of the youma assassin order 
had returned, and the news she had carried did not bode well for the 
others. Makareus believed that the hospital attack had gone just as 
badly; he didn&#39;t expect any youma to return from their mission. How had 
the blasted Sailors known they were coming? The demon had heard tales 
from his agents who used to be posted in Yokohama, about an unstoppable 
warrior who had single-handedly destroyed his brother, Khairephon, and 
nearly the entire reserve force with him. Laodameia&#39;s late bodyguard, 
the youma, Aiaia, had also mentioned something about a Sailor Senshi 
thought long dead being responsible for the carnage back in Yokohama, 
and who had also contributed to Makareus&#39; sister&#39;s downfall. Perhaps 
Makareus should take the tales more seriously. If the warrior was indeed 
a Sailor Senshi, and if one alone could do such damage, it was no wonder 
the war against the group was going so poorly. And now that the demon 
had tipped his hand, the element of surprise was lost and the Sailor 
Senshi would probably be scrambling into hiding right at this very 
moment. And all Makareus had to show for his efforts was a wailing brat 
of a senshi.

&quot;The human said she was a Sailor Senshi in training,&quot; the surviving 
assassin added.

&quot;Perhaps we can use her as bait in a trap,&quot; Iason piped up, &quot;or, if my 
Lord so wishes, we can dispose of her right now and leave the carcass 
where the other Sailor Senshi can find it. The morale blow will no doubt 
be beneficial to our cause.&quot;

&quot;Hmm...&quot; Makareus replied in a non-committal tone. He wasn&#39;t entirely 
sure if the senshi would care if such a thing were to be put out of its 
misery. But the pink-haired entity was a child, and humans cared about 
their offspring, didn&#39;t they?

&quot;On another matter,&quot; Iason said, &quot;assuming the hospital mission was a 
failure, and that the human Makoto Kino was in fact a Sailor Senshi, we 
can initiate another plan.&quot; The youma looked at his master to see if he 
had anything to say, and seeing that he didn&#39;t, the creature continued.

&quot;We know that Kino attends Juuban High School, in Minato-ku,&quot; Iason 
began, flicking through some papers on a clipboard he carried for 
clarification. &quot;It is a possibility that some, if not all, of the other 
senshi attend the same school. We already have agents inserted into the 
teacher and student populations, and using them, we could find out if 
there are any unexplained absences, or who Kino&#39;s friends are, anything 
that will lead us to the identities of other Sailors.&quot; The youma 
finished outlining his plan and looked to his master to gauge his 
response.

Makareus opened his eyes and brought one hand up to his face, tapping a 
finger on his chin in thought. &quot;Do it. Inform the youma in Juuban High 
School to research Makoto Kino&#39;s social activities,&quot; he commanded. Iason 
nodded in obedience. &quot;In the meantime,&quot; the demon continued, &quot;I believe 
I have an idea of how to use this... senshi.&quot; He forced out the last 
word, as if his mouth were rebelling in naming the pink-haired thing as 
one of the rather formidable Sailor Senshi group.

Makareus smiled slyly. His spies in Thrinakie&#39;s forces had reported that 
all the necessary components for the gate had been gathered from his 
home dimension, and the required spells were currently being weaved into 
them. In a few days, all would be ready to open the largest 
trans-dimensional portal there was in Tokyo, and when that happened... 
the planet would be overwhelmed in a matter of days, perhaps even merely 
hours. Luckily, once the components were suitably prepared, one needed 
no skill in the magical arts to activate the portal. Makareus had also 
been successful in quelling the fighting in Khairephon&#39;s former armies, 
and had integrated all the youma from his deceased brother&#39;s ranks, as 
well as half of Laodameia&#39;s, into his own substantial force. Thrinakie 
had taken the other half of his late sister&#39;s troops, but it was of no 
consequence; Makareus would command *all* of his family&#39;s resources soon 
enough. Once the components for the gate ritual were properly prepared 
via enchantment, the demon&#39;s elder brother would have outlived his 
usefulness. Makareus was going to eliminate the crusty fossil *and* the 
Sailor Senshi in one fell swoop. It would leave this world defenceless 
and easy to takeover, plus all of Thrinakie&#39;s empire would become his. 
And the little senshi brat was going to help him do it.

&quot;Keep her alive, for now,&quot; Makareus ordered, gesturing towards the 
child, &quot;I&#39;ll have a use for her in a couple of days. But make sure no 
one under Thrinakie&#39;s command finds out that we have a Sailor Senshi 
prisoner; I want this to remain secret. Understand?&quot; All the youma in 
the room nodded.

&quot;I will make it so, my Lord,&quot; Iason said, bowing slightly.

Soon, you old goat, soon, thought Makareus, his cunning mind still going 
over the details of his brilliant plan, marvellous in its simplicity. He 
would finally be rid of Thrinakie... his older brother already had one 
foot in the grave; Makareus would help him put the other in as well...

Rei snuggled closer to the soft mass next to her, enjoying the sense of 
warmth and comfort emanating from it. The girl sighed blissfully as she 
dozed, feeling safe and at peace. A faint snorting and whistling noise 
was rhythmically coming from Rei&#39;s heat source, but the miko didn&#39;t 
mind. The noise was also comforting in a way, as if soothing her, 
attempting to coax her back into a deeper slumber. Rei&#39;s arm rose and 
fell slowly with every snort and whistle, causing her fingers to rub 
against a series of ridges covered by a silky substance. Her hand was 
enveloped by a light object, smothering the aching appendage in a 
relaxing heat, as if trying to aid in the healing process. Meanwhile, 
she felt a long, hard, yet supple, object between her legs that radiated 
warmth in a pleasant place. Rei clenched her thighs around the object a 
little tighter. So this was what Heaven was like. She could just stay 
here for all eternity, and she would forever be happy. The gods were in 
their Heaven, and all was right with the world.

A faint frown creased Rei&#39;s brow as she heard a voice from far away 
calling something. She tried to ignore it. How dare someone try to 
disturb her peace. The voice persisted however, and Rei had trouble 
blocking it out. It said something like &#39;wake up&#39; and mentioned another 
thing about &#39;being late&#39;. What did the voice know? Rei wasn&#39;t late for 
anything; there was nowhere she had to go, she was in Heaven after all. 
And as for waking up... the voice could forget it. But the voice would 
not be denied, and a name was yelled out. Usagi. The voice didn&#39;t even 
have Rei&#39;s name right. The mass next to the raven-haired girl stirred 
and mumbled something, then was still, resuming the rhythmic snorting 
and whistling again. Rei sighed in satisfaction. But again the voice 
called out the name, and the warm mass groaned and squirmed in the 
girl&#39;s grasp. The mass went still for a moment, and then Rei felt 
something soft and moist touch her forehead, followed by a light sucking 
sensation. For some reason, this pleased her immensely and caused her 
lips to turn up in a small, content smile. The voice yelled out the name 
once more, then Rei heard a steady pounding sound coming from below her 
and gradually getting closer. The mass next to her shifted, and then let 
out a loud yelp. Rei&#39;s source of comfort was torn away from her, and 
Heaven was shattered.

&quot;Crap! I&#39;m sooo late! Sorry, Rei, but I gotta get ready!!&quot;

Rei cracked her eyes open and stared at the back of Usagi&#39;s pink pyjamas 
as they moved like the wind out the bedroom door. She could still feel 
the afterglow of soothing warmth all over her body. Rei slid her hand 
over the indentation in the bed where her princess had just lain seconds 
before, feeling the last remnants of heat. She sighed and rolled over 
onto her back. It had been good while it lasted.

Rei continued to lie like a lump on Usagi&#39;s bed as she heard the hustle 
and bustle downstairs. She heard her only love yell at Shingo to get out 
of the bathroom and then a loud bang. Shingo shouted back some 
unpleasant insults and then was promptly scolded by his mother, Ikuko. 
Another, somewhat muffled, shout quickly followed after, this time from 
Usagi&#146;s father, Kenji, the man howling something about sleeping in for a 
meeting. The Fire Senshi wondered if it was like this every morning in 
the Tsukino household.

But while the Tsukino&#146;s were lively, Rei on the other hand felt like she 
had been battered, then run over by a truck, and then battered again. 
Gods... what time was it? How much sleep had she had? Rei&#39;s eyes slowly 
drifted shut again. It would be rude to sleep in when everyone else was 
probably up and about, but the girl couldn&#39;t help it; she was totally 
wiped out. Where did Usagi, and not to mention the other members of her 
family, get the energy from?

Rei snoozed for a while, despite the sounds from the family downstairs 
preparing for the day. An indeterminable amount of time passed, and then 
she heard a shuffling noise come from inside Usagi&#39;s bedroom. The Fire 
Senshi cracked her eyes open again and rolled her head to the right, in 
time to see her princess pull over her school uniform top. Rei opened 
her mouth to speak a greeting, but all she could manage was an 
unintelligible groan. Usagi must have taken this as a &#39;good morning&#39;, 
even though it was far from enthusiastic, because she turned around and 
gazed down at Rei, smiling pleasantly.

&quot;Morning, Rei!&quot; Usagi said cheerily. &quot;Sleep well?&quot;

The miko merely groaned again in response.

&quot;Yeah, I know, I hardly got any sleep either,&quot; the blonde replied, 
apparently able to decipher the meanings behind the Fire Senshi&#39;s moans. 
&quot;But I have school to go to, unlike *some* people I know,&quot; Usagi went 
on, looking at Rei pointedly, &quot;so I guess I&#39;ll see you later. Don&#39;t 
sleep too long, you lazy bones!&quot;

Usagi then grabbed her book bag from her desk chair and then proceeded 
towards the bedroom door. She halted before she left however, and 
briskly walked back to her bodyguard. Rei kept her eyes on her princess 
the whole time. Usagi leaned down to the tired miko and kissed her 
gently for a few seconds on the lips, which the girl eagerly returned, 
despite her exhausted state. The blonde then gave Rei one last bright 
smile, and then exited the bedroom, no doubt off to school... and 
definitely late. No surprise there, Rei thought with a grin, the texture 
of Usagi&#39;s lips still being felt on her own.

Rei went back to sleep for a few hours, and when she woke up it was 
around ten o&#39; clock, according to her princess&#39;s alarm clock. The miko 
wasn&#39;t sure if it was accurate though, considering how often Usagi was 
late for Sailor Senshi meetings and other appointments. Nevertheless, 
Rei dragged herself out of the blonde&#39;s bed and decided she had lazed 
around long enough; there were things that needed to be done today.

After Rei had finished her necessary tasks in the bathroom, she returned 
to Usagi&#39;s bedroom and got changed into the only set of clothes she had. 
The long black coat from Tsubasa was among her garments; the Senshi of 
Fire had taken to wearing it only at night, but this morning she would 
have to make an exception. Just as Rei was about to leave, Luna leapt 
through the open bedroom window and called out to her. The girl turned 
to face the cat.

&quot;Luna, where were you last night? Usagi and I didn&#39;t see you anywhere,&quot; 
Rei said.

The black feline looked at the miko sternly. &quot;It is no wonder the two of 
you didn&#39;t notice me, with what the both of you were up to,&quot; she replied 
with scorn.

Rei blinked at Luna in confusion, and then the reason why the cat was 
upset dawned on her. Her mind froze for an instant in shock as it 
fumbled desperately for an excuse, for some plausible reason for why she 
was in Usagi&#39;s bed last night and why they were both doing certain... 
things. But maybe Luna didn&#39;t know everything yet. Rei said the first 
thing that entered her mind.

&quot;Er... I- I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about,&quot; she stated rather 
unconvincingly. The miko mentally slapped her forehead. How come her 
brain always failed her when she needed it the most?

Luna gave the senshi a withering look. &quot;I know *everything*; I heard 
what you and Usagi said to each other! You should be ashamed of 
yourself!&quot; the cat shouted, obviously not too happy with the situation.

&quot;You were eavesdropping on us? How could you! Don&#39;t you have any sense 
of privacy?!&quot; Rei yelled back, her temper rising.

Luna glared at the girl. &quot;Don&#39;t you dare take the moral high ground with 
me, after what you have done,&quot; she said coldly. &quot;You know that Mamoru 
and Usagi will marry in the future and rule over Crystal Tokyo together! 
How could you jeopardise that?! And what about Chibi-Usa?! Did you even 
think of that poor girl?? I&#39;m appalled that you would twist your 
friendship with the princess, that you would seduce her and come between 
the future king and queen! Have you no decency?!&quot; she finished in a 
shriek, trembling with fury.

&quot;It&#39;s not like that!!&quot; Rei declared vehemently, her own fury boiling 
over. &quot;I never seduced her! We love each other!!&quot; She balled her fists 
tightly by her sides, barely controlling her white-hot rage. How could 
Luna say these things to her?!

&quot;You love each other,&quot; Luna spat back in disgust, &quot;do you really think 
whatever warped relationship you have can compare to what Usagi and 
Mamoru have? They have *Destiny* on their side! Their heir from the 
future is here, in this time, and if that&#39;s not a reason why you should 
break it off with Usagi, then I don&#39;t know what is!&quot; The feline heaved a 
huge sigh, as if the weight of the world was on her furry shoulders. 
&quot;Honesty, I don&#39;t know what has gotten into all of you, first Ami and 
Makoto, and now you and Usagi. And *you* should know better, Rei!&quot; Luna 
shook her head in bewilderment.

Rei narrowed her eyes dangerously at the black cat. &quot;Destiny... I don&#39;t 
care about &#39;Destiny&#39;,&quot; she sneered, leaning down to where the cat stood 
on the bed and glaring directly into Luna&#39;s eyes. &quot;I know Chibi-Usa is 
an issue, and I don&#39;t want the girl to be hurt. If she will be 
negatively affected then I will stop seeing Usagi. But nothing in the 
future is certain, Luna; Setsuna herself told me that. You don&#39;t know 
what Usagi and I have together, and frankly, I don&#39;t care what you 
think.&quot; Luna let out an indignant squawk, but the Senshi of Fire was 
already speaking again. &quot;Mamoru may have Fate, Destiny, on his side but 
that doesn&#39;t matter to me. This is one fight I *won&#39;t* lose. Usagi feels 
the same way I do about her, and no matter what you, or anyone else says 
or does, I won&#39;t give up this fight, not when there is even a remote 
chance for us to be together. I&#39;ll take on Destiny, Fate, the universe 
if I have to, whatever you want to throw at me, but I&#39;M NOT GIVING HER 
UP!!&quot; Rei roared the last words in Luna&#39;s face, her lavender eyes 
burning with a fiery passion and unwavering will to succeed that 
screamed defiance from her very soul. The feline took a few uneasy steps 
back, having never seen such a determination in all her life.

Rei stood up and looked down at Luna grimly. &quot;Nothing in life is mapped 
out, Luna,&quot; she said firmly, in a much more quieter voice, but with an 
unshakable resolve underlying every word, &quot;there is no fate but the one 
you make for yourself, at least, that is what *I* believe, now. I care 
about Usagi more than anything in existence, and not you, or anyone 
else, has a right to dispute that.&quot; The Fire Senshi finished her speech 
with a challenging stare at the subdued Luna, as if daring the cat to 
make a comment about Rei and her princess&#39;s feelings for one another. 
Luna wisely remained quiet.

Rei turned away from the black cat and marched towards the bedroom door. 
But she stopped with her hand on the doorknob and turned her head back 
slightly over her shoulder to Luna.

&quot;I&#39;d appreciate it if you don&#39;t tell anyone about my relationship with 
Usagi,&quot; the miko requested in a clear voice, but with no trace of 
pleading in her tone, &quot;not for my sake, but for hers. No one but Minako 
knows yet, with the obvious exception of Setsuna, and my princess wants 
to keep it that way, for now.&quot;

Rei then opened the bedroom door and left the stunned feline, the black 
tails of her long coat rippling behind her in the air. The Senshi of 
Fire let out a deep breath as she stepped down the stairs. She had meant 
every word she said to Luna. Rei wasn&#39;t going to give up on her 
princess&#39;s love. There was still Chibi-Usa&#39;s fate to be concerned about, 
but the miko had intended to visit Setsuna today and find out about what 
could happen to the pink-haired girl, and the timeline. But if the news 
were favourable, then Rei would fight for Usagi&#39;s heart with all that 
she was. She would woo her true love with flowers and presents if she 
had to, *anything* to make the blonde choose her over Mamoru. The prince 
may have the &#39;destined by the powers that be&#39; advantage, but Rei didn&#39;t 
care. The raven-haired girl had never thought she would have even made 
it this far with Usagi in the first place, but now here was a chance for 
them to be happy together, forever. And Rei wasn&#39;t going to let the 
chance slip through her fingers.
