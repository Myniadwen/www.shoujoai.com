<h1>Don't Look Back (part 8 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/angelos.html">Angelos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dontlook-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Haruka sighed slightly, tightening her grip on the handles of her 
motorcycle as the woman behind her tightened her grip around the 
blondes waist. They&#146;d been driving for what seemed like forever, yet 
neither seemed to want the magic of speeding together into the wind to 
end.

&#145;But it had to eventually&#133;&#146; Haruka thought regretfully as she saw her 
destination, the first site for the photo shoot the next day. The 
beach was beautifully lit in moonlight; the silver expanse of rolling 
waves foaming along the silver sand seemed to bacon them to it. A 
small grin graced Haruka&#146;s features as she pulled the Bike off the 
highway, knowing Michiru hadn&#146;t seen it yet, since her head was still 
buried into the center of her back, between her shoulder blades.

&#147;We&#146;re here&#148; The blonde murmured into the microphone that let them 
talk through the helmets, causing Michiru to jump slightly before 
yawning, stretching her arms as the Bike finally coasted to a stop in 
the center of the beach.

&#147;Oh Haruka&#133;it&#146;s&#133;magnificent.&#148; The younger woman gasped, awed by the 
majestic beauty around her, &#147;but I thought we were going for dinner?&#148;

&#147;We are.&#148; Haruka smiled, pulling the cover off the small compartment 
at the back to withdraw a small basket of food and a slim paper bag 
that held a bottle of Bailey&#146;s. Michiru smiled, gazing up at the 
blonde as she pulled the helmet off her head, running a hand through 
her hair while carrying her parcels with the other. She walked forward 
some, looking for the right spot while her companion took off her 
shoes and socks, setting them aside before tiptoeing into the freezing 
water.

Turning around after rolling out a small beach blanket, Haruka watched 
the beautiful woman wade into the water as far as her mini skirted 
business suit, obviously chosen by Setsuna for it&#146;s style, would let 
her. The ocean seemed to welcome her, rolling its waves with the 
graceful movements of her feet on the ocean floor. The silver of the 
moon glinted off the surface of the water, seeming to make her hair 
shimmer and her eyes glitter with repressed emotion.

&#147;That&#146;s why I knew you were perfect for me&#148; Haruka blurted, blushing 
as Michiru glanced up to gawk at her, &#147;I mean, for the job, with the 
beach and&#133;yea&#148;

Michiru laughed as her employer rubbed the back of her neck, flushing 
under her intent gaze. She felt slightly barren inside as the other 
woman turned away to pick up the bottle of Bailey&#146;s, pouring the thick 
liquid into two crystal flutes.

&#145;Get your head out of the clouds Michiru, she&#146;s probably only 
interested in you because, well, like she said, you&#146;re perfect for the 
job&#146; the aquamarine haired girl thought, blushing to herself as her 
inner voice told her it was something more then that.

&#147;I hope you like Bailey&#146;s. Lil got Setsuna and Usagi hooked on it 
during the bachlorette party for Usagi&#146;s wedding, and it just caught 
on to the rest of us.&#148; Haruka murmured, grinning sheepishly as she 
handed Michiru a flute of milky liquid, motioning for her to sit down. 
Michiru did, folding her legs gracefully under herself while sniffing 
the odd-looking drink. Taking a sip, she sighed with pleasure as the 
sweet liquid slid around her tongue before she swallowed. After 
downing the rest in silence as her companion dished out various foods, 
she set down the glass, noticing a distinct buzz in the back of her 
head.

&#147;So, why did Usagi marry so young? She doesn&#146;t seem like one to stay 
with one guy. Who&#146;s Mamoru?&#148; Michiru asked, feeling bolder then she 
usually would.

&#147;Well, Mamoru is a resident doctor at Tokyo Medical Research Center 
and Hospital, and they married when Mamoru was going to be 
transferred. They&#146;d planned to have the wedding after he got back in 
two years, only, he didn&#146;t last two months before he came back for 
her&#148; the blonde laughed, a fond smile tugging the corner of her lips, 
&#147;so they got married a lot earlier then planned, and Mamoru is 
finishing his training here. In the meantime, I get my lovely 
assistant back.&#148;

Michiru smiled, thinking how lucky any children the pair would have. 
&#145;Dad was like that when mum was alive&#133;they loved each other so much. 
She&#146;d love to see me now. All grown up. I&#146;ll be able to fulfill her 
dreams of becoming a violinist.&#146; She thought, tears welling up in her 
eyes as she pictured her mother&#146;s face.

&#147;What are you thinking of?&#148;

Michiru jumped, her head snapping up to meet the beautiful teal eyes 
of one very handsome blonde. One very handsome blonde who seemed to 
have gotten closer while she was thinking. Before she could stop 
herself, she started giggling, watching the other woman blink in 
surprise at the reaction when Michiru had seemed about to cry moments 
before. A wicked grin curved Haruka&#146;s lips as she suddenly jumped up, 
leaning over to pluck Michiru from her spot on the ground, holding her 
tight as she kicked and laughed before running over to the waters 
edge, dropping the aqua haired girl into the water.

&#147;Why you-you, you&#146;re next!&#148; Michiru laughed, lunging up out of the 
water to wrap her arms around the stunned blondes neck, tipping them 
both off- balance until they both landed, sputtering and laughing, 
into the cold water. Looking down at Haruka from where she sat, 
victoriously, on the blondes stomach, Michiru grinned, laughing freely 
for the first time since her&#133;since her father had remarried that 
witch.

&#147;What&#146;s the matter? You went all serious on me again&#133;&#148; Haruka 
murmured, snapping Michiru out of her thoughts as she ran one hand 
across the soft skin of the younger girl&#146;s neck.

&#147;Just thinking of my family&#133;that&#146;s all&#133;&#148; Michiru half-lied, shivering 
as the waves rolled out, leaving them both on wet sand, Michiru still 
sitting on the blondes stomach. She leaned down, resting her head on 
the other woman&#146;s chest before closing her eyes, enjoying the feel of 
Haruka&#146;s hands tentatively playing with her hair.

&#147;Want to tell me about it?&#148;

Michiru looked up, bringing her face parallel with Haruka&#146;s, a small 
smile lighting her features as she slowly leaned closer to brush her 
lips against Haruka&#146;s, whispering a small &#145;no&#146; before completely 
closing the gap, relishing in the feeling she&#146;d been missing since 
she&#146;d last been in the blondes arms&#133;

~*~

&#147;You have a problem sir.&#148; A tall woman with dark black hair cut short 
spoke rapidly into a small cell in her hand, a dark look crossing her 
face as she looked down the beach.

&#147;What&#146;s happening Sarah?&#148; the raspy voice of Derek Windwood demanded, 
causing the woman to frown.

&#147;Don&#39;t Snap at me *sir, they&#146;re bringing a new look to the term &#147;roll 
in the hay&#148;. Only this time it&#146;s using sand and MY Haruka.&#148; Sarah 
snarled, using one hand to snap pictures of the two while talking to 
the man who paid her. Anger boiled through her veins as sharp black 
eyes took in the whole scene, watching as her blonde obsession wrapped 
the little bitch in a warp embrace.

&#147;Well, what do you plan to do about it? Are you going to let that 
little bitch take your Prize just as you were about to wrangle it? 
Haruka wanted you. He hired you for the last six photo shoots. It 
wasn&#146;t until Michiru showed up that Haruka lost interest in you. This 
of it this way,&#148; Derek bargained, catching Sarah&#146;s furious interest, 
&#147;if you get rid of that little bitch, then Haruka will be yours again. 
Think about it Sarah, until then, I&#146;ll get you into the Beach photo 
shoots. Be ready for 8 tomorrow morning. Dress to kill. Literally.&#148;

Sarah glared at the phone as a click sounded in her ear before 
snapping it shut, throwing it into the black Jeep behind her. Snapping 
a few more photos for future use, she stared at her beloved a few more 
moments before slipping back into her jeep, driving quietly away&#133;
