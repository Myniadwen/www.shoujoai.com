<p>Makoto stood on stage and sang one of Minako’s Christmas songs. She  motioned for Ami to join her and Usagi shoved the mike, “Go on  Ami-chan!” Before Ami could react, she found the odango-haired girl  pushing her up stage. Meanwhile, Rei settled in the couch as she looked  at the little plushy that Makoto had given her earlier. Ami and Minako  giggled when Makoto gave it to her, while Usagi squeaked in excitement.</p>
<p>“Oh how cute!” Rei grimaced as she set her eyes on the plushy, but Minako nudged her and Rei replied, “Arigato Mako-chan.”</p>
<p>Now  Rei had the little thing on her lap as she watched her friends sing.  She looked at its red hat and couldn’t help but smile slightly. It not  only reminded her of the time she and Minako were supposedly rehearsing  lines, but there was also the time during their New Year’s party that  they had taken a picture together. Rei still had the picture framed in  her room. The truth was, Rei secretly liked the little plushy, but she  would never admit that.</p>
<p>“Attack!” yelled Usagi as she hit a group  of balloons towards Minako and Rei. They both glared at her, as Makoto  laughed. It brought back memories again, a similar situation except  this time Minako was with them. All five girls seemed to have a habit  of always finding each other despite how busy their lives began to get.</p>
<p>“Gomen, I was just trying to lighten up the mood. You two are just sitting there,” said Usagi.</p>
<p>“Perhaps planning something against Usagi-chan,” entered Ami with a menacing voice.</p>
<p>“Aw  Ami-chan whatever gave you an idea like that?” asked Rei as she winked  at her. Makoto and Minako understood and they started to tackle Usagi  to the floor. She laughed hard as she hit the carpeted floor, and they  both began to tickle her.</p>
<p>“Ahhh! Help Ami-chan quick! They’re not playing fair!”</p>
<p>Ami looked at all of them and joined in the fun, as she threw a pillow at Rei’s face.</p>
<p>“In  the name of Mars, I shall punish you!” said Rei as she grabbed the  pillow and began to chase Ami around the room. Ami screamed as she ran  faster and hid beneath the stairs. Minako rolled towards the table and  accidentally knocked one of the platters.</p>
<p>“The cake!!” screamed  Usagi as she dove in time to save the platter. Everyone was silent now  as they tried to digest what just happened. In mid-silence Rei began to  laugh hysterically. Never, in her life had she seen her friends like  this. Everyone then began to join in. Usagi got up and placed the  platter back on the table, but cut a piece of cake for herself.  Finally, she settled in the couch and began to devour it.</p>
<p>It was  nearing the end of the night and Mamoru was on his way with Motoki. As  they walked in, they saw a huge mess of feathers and confetti scattered  across the floor. Usagi noticed him and yelled, “Mamo-chan! You missed  the fun.”</p>
<p>He walked down towards her and laughed as he began to  pick the confetti and feathers from her hair. Ami had begun to clean  and so did everyone. Before they knew it, the room was incredibly  spotless after all that mess. Rei and Minako were the last to leave the  room. Rei turned around and shut the lights off. She sighed as she  decided to leave the Christmas lights on for the night.</p>
<p>Mamoru  drove Usagi home, but before that, he asked that they stop at the park.  They settled at a bench. It was cold and Usagi shivered underneath the  arms of Mamoru. Usagi looked up at him and reached into her pocket,  when she found what she was looking for she presented it. “Merry  Christmas Mamo-chan.” It was the watch with a silver face and a  crescent moon. Mamoru looked at it and kissed Usagi's forehead.</p>
<p>“I  love it. Now it’s my turn.” He took out a small box and gave it to  Usagi. She opened it and inside was a gold locket with a small diamond  encrusted moon in the middle. “Mamo-chan, it’s perfect!” With that she  tip toed and kissed her prince. They stayed there for a little bit, on  that cold night with Usagi wrapped in his arms.</p>
