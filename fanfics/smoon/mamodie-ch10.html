&quot;Ladies and gentleman,&quot; the announcer&#39;s voice said, &quot;Yet again, in the 
interest of fairness, we offer a rebuttal to the omake series &#39;Mamoru 
Must Die&#39;.&quot;

Standing in front of a hanging cloth background are Setsuna and Chibi 
Usa, neither of whom look very happy.

&quot;Hello ladies and gentleman,&quot; the Time Senshi began, &quot;We&#39;re here today 
to complain about our screen time in this omake fanfiction series.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right!&quot; Chibi Usa said, &quot;We&#39;ve had hardly any presence 
whatsoever in these stories, and I know I speak for not only Puu here 
but Hotaru as well when I say that... Hey, wait a minute, where is 
Hotaru?&quot;

Setsuna looked around, visibly irritated, &quot;I don&#39;t know, I thought she 
was with you, I...&quot; her voice drifted off as Hotaru suddenly appeared in 
front of her and Chibi Usa, thus taking up most of the screen.

&quot;Hello everyone, especially you out there Mr. Author.&quot; she said with a 
smile, &quot;I&#39;d just like to say that I had no foreknowledge of this protest 
by my fellow actresses...&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Chibi Usa asked in shock.

&quot;And that I can totally understand the decision not to include the two 
of them in more stories.&quot; Hotaru said as she gestured back at Setsuna 
and Chibi Usa with her thumb, &quot;I mean, plenty of people can&#39;t stand 
Chibi Usa (fourth season anyone?), and as for Setsuna mama... well, 
let&#39;s just say the crows feet around her eyes is ample evidence of here 
not getting any younger.&quot;

&quot;Why you little...&quot; Setsuna growled.

&quot;Myself, on the other hand, I&#39;m slopping over with talent.&quot; the Senshi 
of Death continued, &quot;I also have a large fan base, and am way more 
talented than the two has-beens behind me. To prove it, and in the 
spirit of the poetry of the last omake, I offer up a haiku I made.&quot;

&quot;Mamoru had died

Usagi then dated Rei

She liked it better&quot;

&quot;Why you mercenary little bitch!&quot; Chibi Usa shrieked.

&quot;Do you two mind?&quot; Hotaru asked, &quot;Unlike you two whiners, I&#39;m trying to 
do something to salvage my career.&quot; She then turned back to the 
audience, putting her fake smile back on, &quot;So being men and women of 
good taste, you&#39;ll no doubt want to tell the author you want to see lots 
more of me in this series, and a lot less of two other hacks who shall 
remain nameless but were given undue screen time during the original 
anime&#39;s run (cough- Super S- cough).

Setsuna, scowling at the young Senshi of Death, now came slowly and 
deliberately up to her, &quot;I see.&quot; she said in a dangerously low tone, 
&quot;Well, I have a little haiku for you young lady.&quot;

&quot;Hotaru&#39;s a jerk

I disinherited her

She can go to hell&quot;

Hotaru now was the one scowling angrily. She turned to Chibi Usa, &quot;I 
suppose you have something to add?&quot;

Chibi Usa nodded.

&quot;My friend is a creep

She only thinks of herself

I&#39;ll get even though&quot;

&quot;Oh, is that so!&quot; Hotaru shrieked, &quot;Well, I...&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Artemis yelled as he ran out with Luna, &quot;I don&#39;t see where you 
three get off complaining about screen time. This is my first appearance 
in this series, and Luna&#39;s only had one line in the thing so far.&quot;

Chibi Usa narrowed her eyes as she looked at the two cats.

&quot;Artemis, Luna

They&#39;d better stay out of this

Or they will be fixed&quot;

The two cats quickly slinked away with their tails tucked between their 
legs as Chibi Usa turned back to her ex-friend.

&quot;You big jerk!&quot; she yelled, &quot;The three of us were supposed to stand 
together for our rights!&quot;

&quot;Keep it up you little pink spore and I&#39;ll give you some rights!&quot; Hotaru 
yelled back, &quot;Not to mention some lefts while I&#39;m at it!&quot;

&quot;You know,&quot; Setsuna yelled, &quot;If Usagi had just let me and the others 
deal with you like we wanted to in the S series, you wouldn&#39;t be so 
smart mouthed right now!&quot;

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Hotaru asked as she narrowed her eyes angrily, &quot;Well, I 
just happen to have one more haiku for you both.&quot;

&quot;They are both jealous

Chibi Usa, Setsuna

They both have fat thighs&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Setsuna and Chibi Usa both screamed in unison as veins popped 
out of their heads and their faces turned red with anger. Chibi Usa 
kicked Hotaru in the shin, causing the Senshi of Death to hop around on 
one leg as she painfully clutched the other in her hands. When she 
finally stopped, she took two fingers and poked the pink haired girl in 
the eyes. She then went over to her Setsuna-mama, who had been laughing 
at her hopping around, and proceeded to stomp on her right foot.

&quot;My eyes!&quot; Chibi Usa shrieked, &quot;Ow, my eyes!&quot;

&quot;My foot!&quot; Setsuna cried out as she now started hopping around on one 
foot herself. Hotaru angrily stomped off as Chibi Usa, still blinded by 
the eyepoke, swung out blindly. She missed the Senshi of death, but did 
manage to get the hopping Time Senshi in the gut, knocking the wind out 
of her.

&quot;Ladies and gentleman,&quot; the announcer stated over the bickering in the 
background, &quot;This has been an editorial. We now return you to your 
regularly scheduled omake.&quot;

---Omake Ten: Bouquet---

The day had finally come; it was Haruka and Michiru&#39;s wedding day.

The church was packed with Haruka&#39;s pit crew and Formula-1 sponsors, as 
well as Michiru&#39;s friends in music and the arts. Yo Yo Ma and Itzhak 
Perlman, upon hearing that their fellow violinist was getting married, 
both immediately volunteered to play the music for the wedding march.

At first, finding a minister liberal enough to marry a lesbian couple 
had been a problem. Finally, after an exhaustive search, they found a 
minister in America who moonlighted as a taxi-cab driver who was more 
than willing to marry the pair.

As Reverend Jim Ignatowski declared Haruka and Michiru to be wife and 
wife, the two kissed in front of the alter. Mamoru, forced to sit near 
the back of the church because of arriving late, was one of the first to 
exit. As the large group of men and women exited the church and started 
gathering outside on the lawn, Haruka and Michiru appeared on the church 
steps to thunderous applause.

Michiru turned her back to the guests with a smile as she threw the 
bridal bouquet over her shoulder. Mamoru immediately noticed two things; 
first, the bouquet was falling in his direction.

Second, that a sound like thunder, or the beating of hundreds of horses 
hoofs, was coming toward him. He turned just in time to see hundreds of 
crazed-looking women, desperate to get married, running straight at him.

&quot;It&#39;s mine!&quot; one woman shouted.

&quot;No way, bitch!&quot; another screamed, &quot;I saw it first!&quot;

The last thing Mamoru saw in this world was a very large woman rushing 
at him like an NFL tackler in her desperate attempt to reach the bouquet 
first.

As the dust finally settled, Usagi went over sorrowfully to her now 
squashed boyfriend, footmarks covering his stomped body.

Rei walked over, putting a consoling hand on Usagi&#39;s back, &quot;I&#39;m so 
sorry.&quot; she said, &quot;Are you going to be alright?&quot;

Usagi wiped her eyes, &quot;Yeah,&quot; she sniffed, &quot;Yeah, I think so. Thank you 
for checking up on me.&quot;

Rei smiled sadly, &quot;Well, you know I&#39;d do anything for you.&quot; she said.

Usagi looked at the Fire Senshi, &quot;You would, wouldn&#39;t you.&quot; she said, 
not as a question but as a statement, &quot;You&#39;ve always been there for me, 
always willing to sacrifice yourself for me.&quot; she came closer to her 
friend and fellow Senshi, &quot;You... You love me, don&#39;t you?&quot;

Rei&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;Well, of course.&quot; she stammered, &quot;We all love you 
as our friend and princess, but...&quot;

Usagi shook her head, &quot;That&#39;s not what I mean and you know it.&quot;

Rei closed her eyes and nodded, &quot;Yes.&quot; she admitted, &quot;I love you.&quot;

Usagi smiled as she held out her hand. &quot;Come.&quot; she said as the 
undertakers arrived for the squashed body of her ex, &quot;Let&#39;s go talk 
about it over a sundae at the crown.&quot;

Rei took her hand, smiling as they walked by the guys picking up 
Mamoru&#39;s corpse, &quot;Usagi,&quot; she said with a laugh, &quot;Your boyfriend got 
killed, and you just found out I have feelings for you and you may have 
feelings for me. Only you could think of food at a time like this.&quot;</pre>
