<p><u>Kaiya’s  POV<em>, In the darkness…</em></u></p>
<p>“You’re a coward,  just like your bloody parents!” A gruff, male voice  taunted.</p>
<p>“Urusai! Liar! I don’t believe you!”</p>
<p><em>There  were tear-stained cheeks…Heated rivers slid off curved skin onto  clammy, clenched fists. They were small, inexperienced hands.<br />
</em></p>
<p>“Aww, what’s the  matter?” The voice came again.</p>
<p>“Looks like you made her  cry.” Jeers and laughter followed the snide comment.</p>
<p><em>Was  there more…than one person? Sounds of clanking metal echoed the  scene along with the mocking laughter, various pitches and rhythms.  Yes…A crowd of people most likely.</em></p>
<p>“Whittle baby is  all alone without sister with a superior complex hovering around. Ha!  Hey kid, did you know she was adopted? She’s not even your real  sister!”</p>
<p>“Shut up…” The figure was kneeling, their  face blending into a wall of shadow.</p>
<p>The laughter stopped  momentarily with exception to a few lingering chuckles.</p>
<p>“Crying  is fer weaklings!” Shadowed figures stepped forward towards the  broken girl. Most were grown men. They all seemed to nod in definite  agreement with their leader. “But don’t worry, we’ll make  sure…” A tall male figure gripped a chunk of the girl’s loose  hanging hair and pulled her upwards, forcing her back to straighten  till she stood uncomfortably on her knees. Glaring with a smug smile  he whispered the words deliberately slowly, allowing the excruciating  pain to seep in, “little freak, you… won’t end up… like <em>certain</em> <em>freaks.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Lubb Dubb. </strong></p>
<p><u><em>Reality…</em></u></p>
<p>“Kaiya are  you-“</p>
<p>“YAAAAAAH!”</p>
<p>Everything was suddenly a  blur- the blue sky, clouds and the solid dirt ground all packed into  one image. My hand shot out and gripped the closest object, grappling  it downwards. It struggled back but it not enough, merely a weak  attempt at best. A yelp of surprise had faintly reached my ears but I  easily ignored it; my head was throbbing unpleasantly. I hated it,  why couldn’t I breathe clearly? See clearly? It was as though the  wholeness of my senses had been shattered into pieces of a puzzle  that was being shuffled continually as my body struggled to  re-establish homeostasis.</p>
<p>Lashing out was the initial  instinct that accompanied fear. I wanted to yell, I wasn’t supposed  to feel this anymore!</p>
<p>“Ow! Kaiya stop it! What are you  doing!” A female voice cried out. Strong arms pushed against mine.  Just what <em>was</em> I doing? In sudden confusion I immediately  loosened my hold, slacking the grip on soft clothing. Wait, soft  clothing?</p>
<p>“HAA!”</p>
<p>I couldn’t have prepared myself  for offensive strike being momentarily blind and deaf. Helplessly I  openly received a blow to the head, feeling a fist connect with my  jaw. I was sent flying and eventually rolling until I finally stopped  flat on my back. In no time wasted a dead weight too its opportunity  and pounced on top of my limp body, nailing down my arms and legs,  effectively pinning me down.</p>
<p>The first thing that came to  mind,</p>
<p>“Ow…”</p>
<p>“Wow! That was intense. I  definitely didn’t expect that move…” Someone praised. “You  almost had me that time.”</p>
<p>Through blurred tears collecting  in my eyes I could make out the shape of a person’s face. I  squinted, trying to focus the image, trying to will it clearer but  all I gained was the sight of a long brown blur connected to that  face- which I finally concluded was hair held back in a ponytail. Oh  right…I was…</p>
<p>“Daijobu des ka?” Came the concerned  voice. “Oh no! Did you get something in your eyes when you fell?  I’m so sorry!” The person backed off and released me from the  deadly hold; perhaps they thought I was crying from their assault.  With dusty, sweaty palms I rubbed my eyes tentatively; trying my best  to avoid gathering any potential tear triggering reactions.</p>
<p>“Don’t  rub them!” The voice called out again, “You’ll make it worse.  Try blinking slowly a few times…”</p>
<p>Stubbornly I refused to  heed the advice and continued on with my thoughtless actions. Soon I  was rewarded and responded with a frustrated “Ah!” when grains of  dirt stung sensitive tissue.</p>
<p>“Ow, ow, ow!”</p>
<p>There was a weak shuffling sound moving away, then close again  before I felt a cool presence centimeters from my face. I thought  about jerking away but that was soon ruled out; startling to me a  hand clamped down at the back of my head and pushed me forward gently  into cool fabric. At first I tensed up from the unexpected contact  but my muscles involuntarily began to relax due to prolonged exposure  in company of pleasant relief. Within the few minutes to follow soft  cotton moved rhythmically side to side and dislodged previous  obstruction. It feels so good; I felt like sighing in content but  resisted the urge.</p>
<p>“That should do it.” My companion said  cheerfully with hopeful confidence. The cool bliss started to pull  away back but my hands automatically shot up to prevent it. “Not  yet? H-Hold on, at least let me have it long enough to re-soak it  again for you.”</p>
<p>I remember now.</p>
<p>“Makoto I’m  fine… don’t worry so much.” I tried to reassure the brunette.  The nervousness in her voice disturbed me somewhat- Even more so,  since it was for me.</p>
<p>I felt the cool cloth pushed into my  hands quickly again after I had spoken. Without hesitating I applied  it with light pressure against my eyes; I was certain they were a bit  puffy from continual irritation. Silence followed while I took in  deep breaths to regain lost composure. What I remembered brought  something back, something I wanted to forget. Memories…are  something you just can’t completely wipe away it seems. Even if you  convinced yourself it wasn’t real, even if you thought you lost all  recollection of it, they will never completely vanish; a mark is  always left behind, small traces of consciousness. Sometimes all it  takes is a simple word or thought to break the dam.<br />
  “I guess  we’ve had it for today…” Makoto sighed. I could sense the  disappointment in her voice.</p>
<p>“Wait, one more go okay?” I  suggested. “We came here to practice right? Might as well make the  most of it while we can.” Finally I removed the covering from my  eyes and braced myself for the sun’s intensity. Although there was  a tingling sensation it wasn’t the rude awakening that I expected.</p>
<p>“You sure?”</p>
<p>I looked up to meet the gaze of  dancing emerald eyes, reflecting an anxious caution.</p>
<p>“Hai.”  I pushed myself up. Thinking it a good time as any I proceeded to  stretch on the spot, coaxing the tight muscles into a more flexible  state. Makoto didn’t say anything but instead she watched in  curiosity.</p>
<p>As I rotated my upper body side to side I  off-handedly muttered, “Good for the back, you know?” The girl  seemed to nod in agreement.</p>
<p>Her persistent silence prompted me  to get moving. It was obvious she was holding herself back from  starting the match on the spot.</p>
<p>Without saying another word I  made my way across dusty ground to the other side of the large  ground, thoughtfully contemplating what came to pass of late.</p>
<p>There  hadn’t been a youma incident all week! Meaning: no worrying about <em>where</em> the next fight would be, whether or not to <em>beat</em> my parents into the ground and painfully choosing between watching or  saving. I admit I really did need the break, but now? Chores were  mediocre training, barely enough strain to develop any of the large  muscle groups. And doing the same things routinely whilst knowing you  aren’t getting any stronger is frustrating! So when Makoto phoned  up Rei’s place asking if I wanted to go to this ‘secret training  place’ with her during the weekend I was ecstatic. I even finished  all of my homework ahead of time for this.</p>
<p>“You ready?” I  asked. I saw a small nod from my opponent opposite to me. Both of us  wore the traditional martial arts uniforms, however in black due to  the condition of the terrain. White fabric and dirt don’t mix I  tell ya, Makoto must’ve been thinking the same thing when she lent  me this spare of hers.</p>
<p>Realizing what I just thought I almost  slapped myself. What does it matter what uniform or clothing you  wear? When you get down to it the enemy won’t go easier on you if  you choose to wear a dress instead of armor. It would be your  mistake, your problem. The battles will always go on. That’s why  it’s essential to gain power and to sharpen skills to win…that’s  why I would never turn down a chance to train against a possible  worthy opponent!</p>
<p>“Bring it!” Makoto shouted. To my  amusement her emotions did not die from her bright eyes, instead they  charged up and swirled to the surface full force. How unusual to  fight with emotion. That’s the last thing you need in a fight.  Technique executions are best done through instinct rather than  impulse. Through impulse it is true you may gain a temporary boost of  power… but can the enraged user be trusted to pass judgement on the  right party? Even I have trouble keeping my feelings in check, poor  unsuspecting Makoto almost had a taste of that lesson earlier, but I  won’t let it happen again.</p>
<p>This time…I won’t be  distracted!</p>
<p>I shifted my legs to a low, stagger positioned  base and brought my arms up. My elbows bent but stayed close to my  sides. Taking a deep breath I then raised slightly closed hands to  shoulder height and waited.</p>
<p>The slightly shorter girl  mirrored the exact motions with the exception of having her fists  lowered slightly; instead they were right up by her face.</p>
<p>Breathing noises dropped in volume to a near mute, eyes staring with  commitment. Never look behind always fall forward.</p>
<p>It was  then that I noticed it, Makoto’s breath hitched. My legs  instinctively darted to the right, attempting to meet the other girl  for an angle attack as she dashed forward in a series of quick steps.  Coming through the left side I vaguely felt the breeze of a narrowly  missed jab but it was only the first. Five alternating shots came in  quickly as I quickly adjusted, shifting my head position right and  left.</p>
<p>“HAA! YAH! YAH! HA! NeH!” The last was more of a  grunt.</p>
<p>To my surprise Makoto changed strategy and lunged  forwards, attempting to throw me off by the sudden change of the  attack range. I remember it very well; last time she had caught me in  a certain head hold and I froze. It reminded me of that something.  Well, not this time! I steeled every feeling inside me, staring down  the movement of the aggressive combatant as the distance gap  narrowed.</p>
<p>“Raah!” Here’s the chance.</p>
<p>Dropping all weight onto left heel I fell back till, quickly  becoming perpendicular with the ground, first catching myself with my  right arm. While my spine was straightening I used the spring  momentum and threw my trailing leg up aiming to bash Makoto starting  chin up. But it was a no go; I had barely missed the girl. She had  quick reflexes I’d give her that. However the result wasn’t  unanticipated.</p>
<p>As the brunette shot her head back the  opportunity was exposed, I watched as her hips automatically move  towards me in the reaction. My fingers dug into the Earth, tightening  my hold on the ground painfully while concentrating on tensing all  abdominal muscles. Successfully I was able to freeze my movement  leaving me exactly perpendicular to the uneven terrain. It was my  turn to strike.</p>
<p>My right leg shot back down and scored a spot  in the girl’s stomach area. The brunette gasped, having the wind  knocked out of her and staggered back. Hoping to knock her from her  feet I allowed myself to drop to the ground, planning to attempt a  roundhouse sweep. Perhaps at that moment I felt worried or too caught  up in the action…Whatever it was, I became too anxious and rushed,  taking out only one of her long legs. There was a small yelp of  surprise as the younger girl felt her balance wane at the expense of  having one limb pulled out from beneath her.</p>
<p>I lost balance  and fell clumsily, paying for the sloppy movement. Now it was me who  was on the ground with my back flat against the rocky hard surface,  cursing myself all the while for not taking out both legs. Makoto  took the extra momentum to her advantage and kicked the slipped leg  back causing herself fall forwards. Her fist came up, aiming for mid  chest. Coming down there was a,</p>
<p><strong>Thud!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>For the  most part the blow damaged solid ground. Some dust particles had shot  up as a result. However, the lucky bum managed to nick me in the side  with a pinch as I attempted to twist and evade with delayed reaction.  Although the miscalculation cost me a bit, it would charge the  brunette even more; to my delight Makoto had not considered the  consciences for such an gamble.</p>
<p>“Yah!” Switching back to  the offensive I caught the collar of her undershirt and flipped her  over me; one of my legs dug in below her ribcage and shot up at an  angle, propelling the girl a good six meters before her body collided  with the Earth floor.</p>
<p><strong>THUD!</strong></p>
<p>“Augh!” Makoto  groaned upon the solid contact back first. I watched her from an  upside down point of view as she somersaulted unintentionally until  coming to a stop face first in the dirt.</p>
<p>“I win…”</p>
<p>I  watched the girl get up and jerk her head around to glower at me,  obviously she did not agree. By now I had also regained my stance,  readying for the final confrontation.</p>
<p>“Yeah, right.” The  declaration came out as a hiss.</p>
<p>Indeed she had spirit, you  could tell by the way it seethed in those eyes.</p>
<p>“Hi-YA!”</p>
<p>Another series of jabs were coming but this time I would not  let her get off more than one. As the initial punch lashed out I  stepped forward whilst my body turned partially sideways.  Re-directing the attack with a small nudge with the palm of my hand  to my left side I immediately gripped it with the same hand and  ducked under Makoto’s outstretched arm and around her back, taking  the now useless limb with me. Currently facing her backside I thrust  my right leg into the back of the closest leg’s knee and forcefully  bent the limb to the ground. Shifting dirt was the only sound of our  existences, breaths guarded closely within our chests, one of  surprise, the other of victory.</p>
<p>There had been expected  resistance to the motion but I twisted the captured arm nearly  parallel to her body length and pinned it down onto her back.</p>
<p>“Got  you.”</p>
<p>“Rrrrr.” Under my hold I could feel her muscles  twitch.</p>
<p>“Don’t bother, you can’t do anything. Your upper  body is pinned down onto your weakly propped up knee along with one  of your arms; thus, taking away half of the possible range of motion.  As for your legs, I’m technically stepping on one. The other… is  still being used to maintain what little balance you have left.”  Makoto’s remaining leg that I haven’t confined tensed suddenly. I  could not see her facial expression but her thoughts were clear as  today’s blue sky. “You know, you may decide to make a bid for  freedom and attack with the one limb holding you up…” She seemed  to freeze, listening carefully to what I would say next. “However,  as soon as you relinquish that control it will become <em>mine</em>.”  I played through the predicted sequence in my mind. Releasing the leg  she’ll inevitably fall forward and strike the ground but this time,  leaving herself completely vulnerable.</p>
<p>“Haaa…” Makoto  sighed. “Okay, I get it!” The outburst startled me, I hadn’t  realized that I had pulled her arm up higher.</p>
<p>“Oops! Sorry.”  I apologized and released her. “So, enough for today?”</p>
<p>“I  guess so…” The girl responded, still rubbing her reddened wrist  as she sat cross legged, still on the upturned dirt.</p>
<p>“Here.”  I outstretched a hand to her. The younger girl offered a smile as she  took it.</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the two of us  had changed back into a clean change of clothes. We exited the small  patch of trees back to familiar looking scenery, back to the place  where the contest site was set up the previous week before. I was  mildly surprised at first as well; although I knew of the dense  coverage that was offered during the earlier incident, I did not  expect Makoto to actually use it for a training ground. When she said  ‘secret training place’ the first thing that came to my mind was  some far away place in the mountains. From the books it seemed to be  something that people in this time usually do when they go on a  training quest. Guess you can’t believe everything you read.</p>
<p>“Wow,  tough workout huh?” The slightly shorter girl tried to start  conversation.</p>
<p>“I suppose so.” Beads of sweat were still  apparent by my temples. With small irritation I brushed aside my  bangs and other strands of hair that were slightly matted by the  moisture.</p>
<p>“It might help if you put your hair up into a  ponytail or something when you spar.”</p>
<p>So  it might be a bit of a help but what if my elastic snaps in the  middle of a fight? The small change could be enough to throw  everything off. If I can perform at maximum potential in the worst  conditions then I’ll be even better when I pin my hair back.</p>
<p>“Umm, okay.” Makoto dropped the subject. “Then do you  want to stop off at my place? It’s closer than the shrine.”</p>
<p>‘Huh?”  I gave her a questioning look. What does the shrine have to do with  anything?</p>
<p>“Meaning, you can take a shower there.” Oh…I  watched the girl seem to turn pink at the notion. “Being all sweaty  can be really uncomfortable right?</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess you’re  right.”</p>
<p><u>At the apartment</u></p>
<p>It wasn’t  a very big place, quite small with sparse furniture. A lone balcony  window entrance lay opposite to the front door.</p>
<p>“Come on in,  make yourself at home.” The emerald eyed girl invited. She  proceeded to drop the ripped up garments onto a nearby stool. Unsure  of what to do I also copied the action.</p>
<p>I followed my host  to an entrance of a smaller dark room and paused as Makoto plunged on  ahead, fumbling through its darkness. There was a quick ‘hiss’  sound before sunlight chased away the dark shadows, exposing a quaint  bedroom. It was very neat and tidy, much like the rest of the  apartment I noticed. Even more so, the assortment of stuffed animals  that lay lightly on the nearby bed caught my attention.</p>
<p>“Stuffed  animals…?” I saw some were stuffed puppy dogs, others of various  species of cats. To my surprise, a few appeared homemade; a few  creatures had stitches that were clumsily clinging to fuzzy fabric.</p>
<p>“Ah, those were some of my early attempts.” Makoto  quickly commented, scratching the back of her head in an embarrassed  motion. “These ones are my latest!” She whipped out a few  colorful lizard-like looking things. Taking one into my palm I  squeezed it lightly. By the squishy touch I immediately figured it  was filled with small objects such as beans or beads. “Aren’t  they great?” The girl beamed.</p>
<p>Compared to what she  described as her “early attempts” these were far better with  massive improvements; one could hardly tell they were attempted  originals.</p>
<p>“Yeah.” I stated the obvious fact, knowing the  girl was still beaming. It was amazing actually. Could you even  imagine trying to sew such tiny stitches together? Mind boggling  especially to me since I couldn’t handle arts and crafts. Cleaning?  All right, that I can do. I’d make a decent cook too, but making  cute stuffed creatures…</p>
<p>“Something wrong?” The voice  snapped me out of my dumbfounded expression.</p>
<p>“No, not at  all! Haha…”</p>
<p>“Hey, what do you think of this?” Makoto  shoved a stuffed teddy bear on top of the lizard in my  palm.</p>
<p>“This…?” I studied the bear. “Uhh, it’s  cute?”</p>
<p>“You really think so?”</p>
<p>The hopeful tone  confused me for a split second until I saw the tiny tag attached to  the bear’s ear. <em>“</em><strong>Ami</strong><em>”</em>, My mind  automatically read.</p>
<p>“Making it for Ami chan?” I raised an  amused eyebrow. Seeing the girl blush I knew I hit the target dead  on.</p>
<p>“W-well…you see…” She fumbled through her words  looking for an excuse but failed miserably.</p>
<p>“It’s all  right, I understand.” I assured her. It’s pretty obvious that she  likes the shy Ami Mizuno, or at least to me anyway. I could’ve  sworn I heard her release a breath of relief.</p>
<p>Her  reaction…The immense relief nagged me. I thought back to Haruka’s  explanation of this society’s views of same gender couples for the  umpteenth time since that day. At this moment I didn’t know if I  felt angry, sad or ashamed for these people. Why did it matter so  much? A person is just another human, no matter how you slice it.</p>
<p>“So you really like it?” Came the question again.</p>
<p>“Yes,  it’s very good!” I confirmed my answer with enthusiasm now.</p>
<p>However certain I was that she would inquire once more with  the same lack of confidence I couldn’t have prepared myself for the  next round. She took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“Doyouwantone?” Makoto  speed blurted.</p>
<p>Eh? Mind freeze.</p>
<p>“I mean you don’t  have to take any of these ones,” she pointed to a basket full by  her desk, “I can make one for you. Ack!” The girl looked at the  clock ticking quietly beside me on a small dresser. Funny how I never  noticed it until now. “Got to start cooking. You can use some spare  clothes in the closet, bathroom is out this door, upstairs to your  right.” With that she dashed out. I watched the blur as she ducked  behind a solid wall near the front door, which I assumed, was the  kitchen.</p>
<p>Okay, that…was interesting. Looking at the small  clock again perhaps I was the one who should’ve yelled ‘ack’;  my first music practice with Haruka and Michiru was in two hours!  Almost clumsily I threw open her closet and grabbed the closest pile  of garments. Pants, shirt…doesn’t matter as long as it’s  wearable right?</p>
<p>Before I knew it I was in the bathroom,  searching the place curiously with hurried urgency.</p>
<p>“Let’s  see…A shower looks like that metal bit attached to a bath. So how  do I turn it on?” At Rei’s place we always just used a small  bath. Even at the palace we used baths but a <em>bit</em> bigger. “Aww  crap. Whatever! I’m sure I’ll get it.”</p>
<p>Leaning forward  into the small, contained space I easily found the water knobs. So  which one is which? Turning them both with equal precision I was  rewarded with neutral heated water. Good so far…This time I rotated  the one of the right a bit more and found the mainstream become  cooler.</p>
<p>“Oh, I get it. The one on the right is the cold  water and the left is for the hot water.” Removing the testing palm  away from the steady stream I re-adjusted the water until the liquid  became pleasantly warm.</p>
<p>“There we go.” I praised myself,  feeling pleased at accomplishing the small task. Now that I was on my  knees I noticed a small, circular metal between the hot and cold  water knobs. “Hmm? What’s that?” I peered closer, closing eye  distance to receive a better look at the strange object. A light bulb  went off in my mind. “Ah! I bet…” It was probably what would  trigger the shower!</p>
<p>Without another thought I gripped the  disk between my index finger and thumb, pulling it backwards whilst  watching it stretched out. To my surprise the fast flowing stream of  water suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>“Eh? Oh no! Did I do something  wrong?”:</p>
<p>A strange rumbling shot up through the walls,  startling me a bit. What’s that…</p>
<p>“<strong>ACK</strong>!”</p>
<p>Strong  pressurized water rained down from the showerhead above. I was  completely caught off guard; momentarily have forgotten <em>where</em> shower water probably came from. After floundering around somewhat I  managed to jerk back and abruptly yanked the shower curtain across  the space for protection. Still gasping slightly I knew my face  probably was red with embarrassment<em>. Never</em> have I ever been  ambushed successfully by people and yet…</p>
<p><strong>Knock,  knock.</strong></p>
<p>“Kaiya, is everything alright?” I heard Makoto  tap on the door, awaiting a response.</p>
<p>“Yes! Everything is <em>just</em> great.” I lied slightly.</p>
<p>“I forgot to mention  but I left the shower pressure on really high, you might want to turn  it down before you use it.”</p>
<p>“NOW she tells me.” The  words came out, barely audible under my breath.</p>
<p>“Anyway,  lunch is almost ready. Come out once you’re done and have  some.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” For some reason that last comment struck  me as odd; it was almost like being mothered. It wasn’t the same  like that time Michiru saved me when I first arrived, that time  seemed…special in its own way. Hmm…I pondered. I guess Makoto is  the type of person that just wants the best in everybody; she’d  probably help me if I asked her but should I ask Makoto for help? My  eyes trailed over to the still running shower. No, I do <u>not</u> need to be babysat! I can do figure things out on my own, my mind  rebuffed the idea. “Right, time to conquer this monster.” I  committed, readying to show that mechanical water gun who’s boss.</p>
<p><u>After the shower</u></p>
<p>Upon exiting the  water chamber a mouth watering aroma reached my senses. Before I  could stop myself I found myself saying,</p>
<p>“Hey, that smell’s  good.” I said it more to myself but Makoto popped her head around  the corner as the words left my mouth.</p>
<p>“Glad to hear it.”  She smiled. “I hope you’re hungry.” I noticed her changed  attire. She was carrying a large plastic spoon-like scoop in her hand  and a feminine decorated apron hung around her front was revealed as  she fully emerged from the hiding spot. Seeing my staring she  explained, “Pink is my favorite color.”</p>
<p>I just nodded my  head. Pink was actually my least favorite color, not that I have any  trouble with other’s wearing it but let’s just say you wouldn’t  find a scrap of pink fabric anywhere in my dresser.</p>
<p>“Have a  seat.” Makoto kindly pointed to the small table where two plates of  rice stir fry awaited. We both walked over to the table but not to  forget my own manners so soon I replied,</p>
<p>‘You first.”  Pulling the chair out for her to seat first.</p>
<p>“Oh…thank  you.” She seemed slightly embarrassed at the action but accepted it  nevertheless.</p>
<p>Taking the seat across from the brunette I  resolved to make absolutely sure she would take the first bite of the  meal. Back at home they would always have the meals tested before  serving it to either Hotaru or me but this reason was something more  simple; I wanted Makoto to reap the rewards of her own hard work.  From sight and smell it was obvious the dish had a lot of care put  into it.</p>
<p>“Is something wrong?” The girl asked  nervously.</p>
<p>‘Nope.” I replied, making sure to smile  reassuringly.</p>
<p>Makoto’s eyes relaxed slightly but neither  of us made the first move. What was wrong? Or…did she expect me to  comment on it first? That must be it! I slapped myself mentally. I  guess I still have a lot to learn about manners here in this time.  Taking a spoonful of the substance I chewed on it thoughtfully,  letting the combination of flavors mix into something greater.</p>
<p>“It’s  delicious.” I complimented the brunette.</p>
<p>The other girl  smiled. Looking pleased she finally dug into her own portion with  enthusiasm. All that training must’ve taken its toll on her hunger.  Spoonful after spoonful the contents slowly disappeared to a ‘better  place’.</p>
<p>All the while as we ate in silence I would  occasionally glance at the clock hanging on a nearby wall. Only forty  minutes have passed.</p>
<p>“Kaiya.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?” I looked  up.</p>
<p>“I-I know this is none of my business but I heard from  Rei…I’m sorry to hear about your parents.”</p>
<p>The sentence  seemed to hang in the air. The awkwardness was not caused from anger  toward the miko who had blabbed personal information nor towards the  subjects of the topic. For some reason, I didn’t feel anything at  all; no dominating emotion seemed to penetrate the neutral condition  of my mental state. Letting the words sink in I finally  replied,</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Makoto’s sympathy made me  wonder.</p>
<p>“If it makes you feel any better, I kind of know  what it feels like.” I studied the girl, searching her eyes for any  hints of reason. “Mine died in an airplane accident.” She finally  revealed.</p>
<p>Since the start I suspected it had something to do  with it – no family portraits, the less than family sized room  apartment, the singular bed, unusual amount of stuffed creatures…It  was because, she had no family. Mildly I was startled even though I  shouldn’t have been as I had been right all along.</p>
<p>“I’m  not sure what to say.” I admitted. The girl knew her parents were  dead, there was no hope that she could bring them back or find them  alive miraculously. In my case, I was much better off I realized. <em>Much</em> better off.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, really.” But she  really wasn’t okay as she was letting on.</p>
<p>“Do you want to  talk about it?” I finally asked.</p>
<p>Makoto sat there, staring  blankly at me with empty eyes.</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>“Look, you  can’t keep things bottled up. It’s not healthy; eventually it’ll  build up so much you’ll snap.” It was true, but I think she  needed someone to say it.</p>
<p>The brunette bowed her head  slightly, her bangs covering her eyes.</p>
<p>“…”<br />
  <u><br />
    Leaving  the apartment</u></p>
<p>“See you sometime soon?” I  asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Oh and good luck with your rehearsal” The  girl cheered me on.</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>We both split up,  going opposite ways from the front of the apartment building. Makoto  mentioned she was going to check out some shops with Usagi and not  wanting to run into that talkative blonde I took a pass on tagging  along. Thoughts of being cornered with questions were becoming a  phobia of mine these days.</p>
<p>I had made it down the block where  we had separated when I decided to do a quick check. “Bracelets…”  The slight bulge in the borrowed windbreaker jacket told me of its  presence. “Key…” Yup, I smiled, feeling the cool metal between  my fingertips in the black, jean pocket. Seems to be everything.  About to saunter off I realized that there was something else in the  key pocket. “Even got a…<em>wallet</em>!”</p>
<p>Clutched  lightly in my hand was a small, leather wallet.</p>
<p>“B-b-b-b-but!”  I stuttered. This isn’t mine! My mind screamed. Then…Makoto…”Just  great.” I gritted my teeth. “Makoto!” Doing a 180 I rushed off   in the direction I last saw her leave, hoping somehow that I would  catch up to the brunette before my appointment.</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s  POV, riding her motorcycle</u></p>
<p><u></u>Not a single youma attack  all week! I can’t stand this; it’s driving me crazy, when will  they attack? How much longer must Michiru and I wait before our next  chance at another crystal? That last incident still weighted heavily  on my stressed out mind. During that pathetic excuse for a contest  some bastard used <em>my</em> power again! Who do they think they are?  Coming into someone else’s battle, then turn tail and run? Worst  yet, I <em>almost</em> had them! So close…Then I fell for the oldest  trick in the book. Memory of the tree branch colliding with my face  burned humiliation in my mind.</p>
<p>My hands gripped the bike’s  handles as I made a sharp right turn and down the nearly empty  street. More questionable, the stranger had only used Uranus’s  powers, not Neptune’s. What did it add up to? Did it mean they  couldn’t use it or they just chose not to?</p>
<p>“AH!” Through  the visor flashed two pedestrians in my path as I made another right  turn. Shimatta! I stomped down on the brakes.</p>
<p>“Usagi!” One  of them shouted.</p>
<p><strong><em>Screeeeech!</em></strong></p>
<p>Luckily I  was able to turn the bike in time, but just barely! Those kids…</p>
<p>“I’m  so sorry!” I knew I shouldn’t have been driving in a rage. “You  want me to call an ambulance?”</p>
<p>“I think…we’re fine.”  The brunette of the two finally responded. In an instant I recognized  the girls, Makoto and Odango. Faintly I heard the blonde mutter an.  “Call my lawyer,” remark.</p>
<p>“No please! I’ll lose my  wheels.” Losing my transportation would just kill me; I can see  Michiru chiding with an ‘I told you so’. Can’t have that  happening, I’d rather die first.</p>
<p>“Oh, Haruka! I was only  playing.” Irritation shot through my stomach. That kind of sense of  humor…</p>
<p>“You sure about that?” My eyebrow twitched. To  prevent anything I may regret I turned to check up on the brunette.  “Hey, that looks like a nasty scratch!”</p>
<p>“W-what? Oh,  yeah, I guess it is.” For a moment I couldn’t tell whether she  was still in shock or not; that spaced out expression was indicating  ‘no one was home’.</p>
<p>“Let me help you.” Undoing the  scarf around my neck I proceeded to bandage the series of scrapes on  her one hand.</p>
<p>“But your scarf, it’s going to get all  dirty.” Makoto complained. “You shouldn’t…”</p>
<p>“Zip  it!” I almost snapped. “Look, it’s the least I could do for  nearly plowing you guys over.” Preventing any more argument I  quickly added, “I don’t have many friends around here, I better  take care of the ones I’ve got.”</p>
<p>The other girl just  nodded her head.</p>
<p>“So no hard feelings?” Just to be sure I  won’t be hounded down later on.</p>
<p>“Nope.” They both  agreed.</p>
<p>“Great. See ya guys later.”</p>
<p>After giving  a little wave I sped out of that intersection quick as possible. That  was close! How could I have been so careless? The self-bashing could  have gone on for hours but one glance at my clock changed the inner  complaints. Awww, so much to do! Got to call Michiru, pick her up and  take her to our scheduled rehearsal – that Kaiya better show, and  then worry again about our enemies next move.</p>
<p>Finally into a  more isolated area I brought the bike to a steady halt. Making sure  no one was within ear range I whipped out the watch communicator and  called the aqua goddess. She better pick up, I need someone to talk  to… almost running over innocent bystanders really shook me  up.</p>
<p><em>Beep, beep, beep…</em></p>
<p>The small, golden  gadget bleeped a number of times before the screen finally got  through.</p>
<p>“Michiru?”</p>
<p>My screen depicted a blue  tiled wall, not the person I was searching for.</p>
<p>“Michiru?”  I repeated louder. “Hey, Michiru!”</p>
<p>“Calm down Ruka, I’m  right here.” Her voice finally erupted from the speaker.</p>
<p>“Where?  I don’t see you…Oh! Are you in the pool again?”</p>
<p>I heard  her giggle. “Good guess.”</p>
<p>“Uh…well then, almost ready  to go to rehearsal?” So maybe I won’t tell her about the near  motorcycle accident after all. “I can be there in ten  minutes.”</p>
<p>“Michiru?”</p>
<p>The other  end went silent. Despite feeling the need to panic I forced myself to  relax. Always assuming the worst will definitely take its toll on  you, either making you age past your years or in the form of a heart  attack. That when I felt it- a cold wave wash over me. Now I was  standing in the middle of the ocean, its current collapsing layer  after layer of water upon me.</p>
<p>“Do you feel that?” Came  Michiru’s solemn voice. It was no longer cheerful.</p>
<p>“The  wind…” I muttered, tilting my chin up to the watch the sky above  through the waters. I could see a gathering of dark clouds in the  clear sky, a storm with lighting and thunder accompanying the raging  body that surrounded me. My element howled warning, of foreboding.  Ignoring the shivers racing down my spine I sought out the other  presence in the chaos, searching for <em>her.</em></p>
<p>“It’s  close.” I muttered to my partner. The water around my sides sprung  up into a swirling tornado with me at its center eye. Michiru’s  serious gaze caught mine from the cliff edge she sat on nearby.  Indeed she was still dressed in the school swimsuit.</p>
<p>“…ten  minutes...” The waves carried her faint voice to my waiting  ears.</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV</u></p>
<p>“How  could she have gotten so far in such a short time?” I just wanted  to shout out in frustration. Makoto sure couldn’t buy anything  without her wallet…</p>
<p>“Earth to Makoto…” The familiar  name caused my ears to twitch. Looking across the street there was  Makoto and Usagi. Ah! I’ve got to get over there.</p>
<p>“Umm…”  Looking both directions of the seemingly isolated road and finally  deciding it would be safe I attempted to cross only to have a pack of  cars rush around the corner! “Gah!” I yelped, jumping back just  in time narrowly avoiding injury. Where…the hell do these cars come  from?</p>
<p>Screeching wheels and honking horns drowned out what I  tried to yell next,</p>
<p>“MAAAAKOTO!”</p>
<p><strong>Honk, honk!  Bleep!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Some random driver then felt it was necessary to  point out,</p>
<p>“Crosswalk is back there stupid!” The  passengers in the back seat jeered as well.</p>
<p>Why I  oughta…Thoughts of breaking that puny, hunk of junk they called for  a car into pile of dust appealed to me but that was short lived as I  noticed Makoto and Usagi had began walking away.</p>
<p>“Shit!”  Doing the best thing I could I ran down to crosswalk, jogging lightly  on the spot wishing it would change <em>soon.</em> The count down meter  across the street read ‘30’…’29’…This is great, just  great.</p>
<p>Thirty seconds and a mad dash sprint later I made it  to where I last saw the two girls. They were…going in this  direction! Deciding to use instinct I was about to dash away but  halted when I smelled the familiar aroma of sizzling noodles. Not  that I was hungry or anything but I was sure a certain blonde may be.  Remembering the insane food obsessed drool from the Odango my feet  zipped off towards the open market.</p>
<p>“Makoto!” I called  through the crowd.</p>
<p>Stalls littered the sidewalk as merchants  dealt fresh fruit and vegetables. More developed stalls actually  served as tiny restaurants. Ramen shops, cafes, snack bars…It was  crowded! Searching further down I passed a few dealers trading  watches and games of all sorts whilst small children ran freely under  adult supervision.</p>
<p>“Mmph…Yummy! More please!”</p>
<p>I  spotted the owner of that voice.</p>
<p>“Usagi!” I shouted,  gripping the slightly startled girl by the shoulder. She turned  around and eyed me quickly before cheerfully greeting,</p>
<p>“Hi  Kaiya, want some?” The blonde shoved a bowl of ramen under my  nose.</p>
<p>“Ahh…no thanks, I just ate. Do you know where Makoto  is?”</p>
<p>“She left with Ami.”</p>
<p>“Ami?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,  Makoto wanted to return Haruka’s scarf.”</p>
<p>“Scarf?”</p>
<p>A  cook handed the starving girl with another extra large bowl of  chicken ramen.</p>
<p>“Yup…” She gulped down a mouthful and  shoved more noodles into her mouth. “Hafuca ammofe ram uf ovar.”</p>
<p>“Could…you say that again?”</p>
<p>The girl swallowed  and took a deep breath, “Haruka almost ran us  over.”</p>
<p>“WHAT!”</p>
<p>“Oh, chill. I said almost but  it was an accident.” Usagi waved at me, motioning for me to let the  idea go.</p>
<p>“B-but…” I sighed. “Let me get this straight.  Haruka almost ran you guys over then I’m assuming Haruka gave  Makoto a scarf to make up for it and then Mako went with Ami to give  it back?”</p>
<p>“Yup, you got it.” I was rewarded with the  thumbs up pose.</p>
<p>Stopping for a moment I thought the entire  explanation through. Makoto went to give Haruka back her scarf…with  Ami? It didn’t seem right, weren’t there cram sessions still  going on?</p>
<p>“Usagi?”</p>
<p>“Hmm…?”</p>
<p>“Did Ami  get out of cram school early today or something?” From what I’ve  observed of the blue haired genius during Rei’s study group  meetings through the past week she seemed to be a person to take her  studies seriously; always helping the group solve the problems,  giving free tutoring. You can’t get top grades in the school by  doing nothing as well.</p>
<p>“Yeah, she said she’d learn the  material on this new online program instead from now on. Something  about saving time and such.” Computer sessions? That sounds...  “Isn’t that great? Now she can spend more time with the gang.”</p>
<p>This girl was clueless…Her dopey smile was nothing  confidence inspiring. Any rational person who thought about it would  spot the immediate problem. You can’t learn nearly as much by  yourself as in a classroom. Asking questions, listening to a  teacher’s explanation compared to reading texts on a mechanical  screen is superior by far. If you were serious about marks you’d  stick with the classroom settings if possible. And as for saving  time? Not a chance, if anything it’d take more time! I don’t like  the sound of this, not at all!</p>
<p>“Which was did they go?” I  nearly demanded. Patiently I watched her point her chopsticks down  the route I had been travelling earlier. “Thanks Usagi, but I gotta  go now!”</p>
<p><em>“After they died they left me all alone.”</em></p>
<p>I  could still see the tears that girl had tried to hold back. Those  blue rivers ran down her cheeks, how they rained onto clenched fists  below.</p>
<p>“<em>Do you hate them?”</em></p>
<p><em>“At first…then I  wished, if only…”</em></p>
<p>Still whizzing by the stalls I shot  out an arm to clutch a large hooded cloak from a anime cosplay shop.</p>
<p>“Hey!” The shopkeeper cried in surprise. Digging into my  own stash I threw back a few bills to ease the man’s ‘loss’,  hoping it was enough.</p>
<p>Makoto didn’t truly hate them… More  than anything she wished she could see them again, just being a  family again. A wounded soul of a girl who is trying her best not to  let everything crumble.</p>
<p><em>“But you know…”</em></p>
<p><em>“I  have someone to protect now.”</em></p>
<p>“Ha…ha…ha!” I  gasped, sliding on the heavy cloak and hood over me to disguise my  form. It was Ami she was talking about. The content look of the gift  she crafted for the shy girl made my inside’s twist painfully.</p>
<p>I  reached the fence barrier that wrapped around a small junkyard area,  the place reeked of youma.</p>
<p>“That’s…JUST  LOW!”</p>
<p>Catapulting myself up and off the tall fence I  spotted the monster as it just wrapped Makoto in its grasp.</p>
<p>“World…SHAKING!”</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s  POV</u></p>
<p>Haruka and I were already transformed and  camouflaged in the surrounding area. It did strike me strange, the  aura being emitted by the brunette’s blue haired companion. It was  almost as though it wasn’t human.</p>
<p>“Umm…Ami? I’m  pretty sure this isn’t the way to Haruka’s house.” Makoto  finally spoke up. “Ami?”</p>
<p>“Something’s up.” Uranus  muttered suspiciously by my side.</p>
<p>We both eyed the pair enter  the small junkyard.</p>
<p>“We’re here…” Ami declared in a  low, creepy voice. Makoto watched her friend from the backside,  unable to see the girl’s face.</p>
<p>“Ami, are you  alright?”</p>
<p>“Never better…NoW tHaT YoU’rE hErE!  AHAHAHA!”</p>
<p>Makoto immediately stepped back as ‘Ami’ was  surrounded by a blue swirl of negative energy. My stomach flipped as  there was a sickening rip whilst the girl pulled the false face off  and replaced it with a new mask.</p>
<p>“You’re not Ami!  You’re…” The brunette shouted.</p>
<p>The grinning mask the  monster had put on smiled wickedly at its prey.</p>
<p>“Worry about  yourself little girl!” From its sides, ropes of scarlet fabric shot  out.</p>
<p>“Ah!” In no time the girl was caught in its trap.  “Let go of me!”</p>
<p>“Wait for it Neptune.” Uranus read my  mind. “Hold it back, just a little longer.” But I could see her  struggling to hold back herself.</p>
<p>It hurts, I’ve never been  able to get used to it; watching the victims cry for a savior while  being tortured with enough fear to make one’s heart stop. But to  save them, the universe, it had to be done. Another scream filled the  air and I closed my eyes, hoping to shut it out…However, it wasn’t  Makoto who screamed.</p>
<p>“World…SHAKING!”</p>
<p>Whipping  my head to the direction of the voice I saw a cloaked figure leap  over the fence and smash a world shaking into the ground – both  catching their fall and sending the mighty blast towards the  unsuspecting youma.</p>
<p>“Yaaaa!” The monster cried, releasing  its hold on the target.</p>
<p>“Go, get out of here!” The figure  instructed the brunette. Makoto hesitated at first but reluctantly  nodded and dashed out of the area entrance.</p>
<p>“Damn it!”  Uranus hissed.</p>
<p>“Should we follow the girl?”</p>
<p>“No,  wait a sec, I want to see this.”</p>
<p>Training our eyes on the  intense increasing battle I tensed up, feeling something familiar  about this stranger. What’s this feeling? As if you know someone  you’ve never met before? The combatants clashes drew my attention  once more.</p>
<p>“Ha!”</p>
<p>The stranger gripped the  monster’s shoulder, flipping over it’s head and sent a surely  mind numbing elbow to its neck.</p>
<p>“Gah!” It screeched. Red  fabric shot out and attempted to catch its new prey but was  unsuccessful as the person shot themselves off of the monster’s  back into the air and out of range. “Grr…Hold still!” It  cried.</p>
<p>“You’re too slow.” The person taunted, prompting  the monster to shoot itself towards the figure.</p>
<p>Again the  cloaked person evaded, however this time to the side and released  another world shaking.</p>
<p>“World, SHAKING!”</p>
<p>This one  barely scrapped the monster’s flexible form. I realized it was  adapting to the speed of the attack. Whoever this stranger was, they  would need to change strategies to win this one.</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s  POV</u></p>
<p>Shit! I missed!</p>
<p>Another barrage of ropes  came jumping off the ground, aiming not only to capture but this  time, kill.</p>
<p>“HA!”</p>
<p>Somersaulting backwards up  into the air I managed to land on one ribbon as it shot past and  jumped off of it behind a mass of broken down cars. If I don’t do  something soon I’ll lose, but what can I do? All I really know how  to use is the World Shaking. Could I use the Deep Submerge as well?  Then again, that would be risky; to try a new attack or plan during  battle when things actually count!</p>
<p><strong>Thud, thud!</strong></p>
<p>Leaning  back on the shelter I could feel the solid parts shift and churn,  some crumbling deeper into each other. Stupid monster is trying to  bulldoze its way through the metal mountain. What to do, what to do?</p>
<p>“Hahahaha!”</p>
<p>I turned to look up just in time to  see the youma falling down towards me, apparently ditching the ‘use  force method’. I’m going for it, I  decided.</p>
<p>“Deep…SUBMERGE!”</p>
<p>However as I raised my  arms I noticed the symbols of Neptune did not appear as normally  would for an attack of Uranus.</p>
<p>W-what…</p>
<p>“ACK!”</p>
<p>Leaving  myself wide open the youma seized its chance; gripping my cloak by  the collar it shoved me painfully into the ground back first. Vaguely  I could stones grinding into my limp form and the friction of the  jagged rocks heating the thick material against my skin. We finally  stopped as my head lightly touched the fence at the other end of the  junkyard, at least thankfully I didn’t break my head through that  wood.</p>
<p>“End of the line for you.” The youma gloated. It’s  hold tightened and I gasped, bringing my hands in an attempt to  prevent any type of strangling. If the thing could see my eyes I bet  it’d melt on the spot; I was that angry. However, my hood still  shielded my face to its advantage.</p>
<p>“Think so? You really  value that mask don’t you?”</p>
<p>Feeling the sudden lack in its  grip answered my suspicions and gave me <em>my</em> chance. In a sudden  movement my hand shot up, capturing the monster by the neck.</p>
<p>“Eat  this!”</p>
<p>Shifting all my weight I threw the enemy headfirst  into the solid fence. A loud crunch of breaking wood echoed the air  but I didn’t hear it, I was too busy enjoying the flickering pieces  of bark that showered the area around me knowing the pain I caused  was successful.</p>
<p>The creature flipped and slid along the  ground outside of the junkyard into an area of newly grown grass. It  howled in pain, covering its face in agony.</p>
<p>“My mask!” It  shrieked.</p>
<p>Before I could make another move it stood up and  ran off.</p>
<p>“Wait!” I cried out too late.</p>
<p>“I think  you should be the one doing the waiting.”</p>
<p>My blood ran cold  as I turned to face the stern voice.</p>
<p><u>Uranus’s  POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>“I think you should be the one doing the  waiting.”</p>
<p>The cloaked figure turned slowly on the spot,  taking their time to acknowledge Neptune’s presence and myself.</p>
<p>“Tell us, are you a friend of foe.” Neptune inquired.</p>
<p>“Friend of foe?” The person echoed.  “That…depends.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean depends?” I  challenged their answer. “You’re either one or the other!”</p>
<p>“Are  you after the talismans too?” My partner investigated further.  Feeling ignored I stepped down momentarily and listened eagerly to  the next response.</p>
<p>“…No.”</p>
<p>“Then why do you  interfere? Better yet, how is it that you can use planet power? Only  Sailor Scouts should be able to wield such elements.” That’s what  I was going to ask, I grumbled to myself.</p>
<p>When  they did not respond I felt compelled to ask another question that  had been weighing heavily on my mind since the first incident back  then.</p>
<p>“How…how can you use <em>my</em> powers?” I growled.  Hate and frustration drenched every word. “How can you use powers  of Uranus!”</p>
<p>“That…” My heart almost stopped. “Isn’t  important.” Just when I was thinking I would finally receive what I  sort after for these past few weeks was shot down.</p>
<p>I  exploded, “It’s important to me!”</p>
<p>In a burst of speed I  dashed forward, raising my fist to strike the stranger. The runt  deserved to be taught a lesson, that attitude pisses me  off.</p>
<p>“World…SHAKING!” I cried.</p>
<p>The attack had  crossed half the distance. As I expected the stranger to fight back I  heard,</p>
<p>“Deep… SUBMERGE!”</p>
<p>So close to hitting the  target but I was stopped.</p>
<p>“Neptune…” I whispered, half  disbelieving what had just happened.</p>
<p>“Calm down Uranus,  fighting won’t get us anywhere.” Neptune cautioned.</p>
<p>It was  all I could take. Immediately I dashed off into the shadows of the  surrounding area, wanting more than anything to sulk. Or more  importantly, I didn’t want her to see my face, the way it was  twisting in pain at that moment. I lost control, I didn’t even know  if that being was my enemy but it didn’t matter to me…</p>
<p>“Uranus!”  I heard her call to me but I brushed it aside.</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s  POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Looks like your ‘friend’ ran off.”</p>
<p>“…”  Neptune glowered slightly at the remark. The reaction wasn’t  surprising.</p>
<p>Silence rang through the air as we both prepared  ourselves for possible confrontation. Calmly I re-assessed the past  two minutes: Once again I am being bombarded with annoying questions  and then Uranus runs off. She seemed very…mentally unstable; her  voice, the look of shock mixed with anger in those normally composed  facial features. But it was not rocket science to understand why. Her  pride, I realized had suffered a huge wound. Could she say she was  the Senshi of the wind, the <em>only</em> one who could wield Uranus’s  powers? Definitely not as I stand here in this time. And although a  part of me felt sympathetic towards the other blonde it wasn’t  enough to smother the hate I still harbored for her, it wasn’t  enough by a long shot.</p>
<p>With unblinking eyes I watched Neptune  sink her body into a battle stance. Her aqua eyes bore into the  shadow of my hood, searching for any hint of my identity. Reading the  tactic easily I lowered my head, allowing the hood to sink lower and  smiled as the other girl frowned with disappointment. It bothered me,  I couldn’t do the deep submerge in the last battle when I needed  it…And here, in front of me stands the being that could without any  problem whatsoever. Any frustration that the senshi of the ocean  experiences now was lessening my own.</p>
<p>I hate you…My  thoughts directed towards the aqua haired woman.</p>
<p>“Tell me,  are you human?” She asked. It seemed to be a desperate question,  perhaps hoping it would get me talking but I only found myself  angered; I should be the one asking the questions, I’m the one who  should be lashing out in frustration! I thought of Uranus’s  anger.</p>
<p>My hands squeezed into tight fists, feeling the nails  dig into soft flesh to keep my mind on the pain and not revenge. Deep  breaths…deep breaths…Instead it sounded like I was gasping for  air; my breathing picked up and all attempts to take them slowly  failed miserably.</p>
<p>“What…does it matter?” I  snapped.</p>
<p>“Your outfit…” She mused.</p>
<p>Ah! Although  the cloak did shield a lot it couldn’t hide my borrowed civilian  clothing. The jeans and part of my shirt were visible but I wouldn’t  allow myself to be stressed at the notion; they weren’t even my  clothes! Feeling somehow lucky and clever at the same time I almost  laughed, I still held all the cards.</p>
<p>“What do you consider  human?” I was going to stuff this topic down her throat. “Is it  someone who looks like you? Two arms, two legs and a head? Or is it a  being that dresses in your average everyday clothing? Who eats  similar foods and lives the same boring lifestyle? Well?” I saw the  other girl hesitate, motivating me further. “People think they are  so superior! But just look at them, a good lot are corrupted cowards,  acting like the wild animals they condemn, preying on the weak of  their own kind.” An image of my younger self being kicked flashed  across my mind. Laughing, so much laughter and it had been all  directed at me. Suddenly all else, Hisa, Makoto, Hotaru…were  cleared from my rage driven mind.</p>
<p>“They’re all not like  that!” Neptune argued. Her battle stance faltered as she took a  step back.</p>
<p>“Or maybe…” My voice whispered. “More  importantly, to be human you should not have unnatural powers!  Neptune! I think you should be the one telling me, are <em>you</em> human?”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened at the accusation, unable to  answer immediately. For the first time I saw her aqua blues dart  uncertainly towards the ground. Contemplating my own thoughts I  already knew that I was more than human, something unnatural that  perhaps shouldn’t even exist. However, I accepted the fact since  way back, what did it matter if I was human or not? I live, I  breathe…talk, eat, laugh, cry…I even have… ‘Friends’. The  word penetrated the fog that clouded my thoughts. That’s  right…</p>
<p>Against my will the anger slowly dissipated into the  limitless sky.</p>
<p>Looking up I found myself thinking strangely  how pretty the sky was today; the clouds just floating on  by.</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>The held back gasp caught my  attention. Neptune was shaking her head between her hands. A pained  look darkened her expression. What…did I just do? A rush of guilt  shot through my heart; sailor senshi surely ask themselves the same  question throughout their lifetime. Why did I have to bring it  up…<em>Because you were angry</em> I answered myself. But shouldn’t  be used an as excuse to lose my cool.</p>
<p>“What… do you fight  for?”</p>
<p>Neptune slowly opened her eyes and registered the  question quickly as if it was one of those with an obvious  answer.</p>
<p>“For love and justice…for peace.” I noticed her  breathing rate was returning to normal.</p>
<p>“You’re saying  that ‘peace’ is determined by people’s heart crystals?”</p>
<p>She  silently nodded her head. Seeming to have made up her mind about  something she continued.</p>
<p>“Three magical talismans hold the  fate of humanity, three.” She held up three fingers for emphasis.  “As you’ve already noticed, all people hold a special crystal of  their own which only makes our duty so much more difficult to  accomplish.”</p>
<p>“You and Uranus?”</p>
<p>Another  nod.</p>
<p>“Why is it just you two? Can’t anyone else do it?  What about the other sailors?” Carefully I had chosen those  words…If I commented directly about the inners Neptune would figure  out I knew more than I was letting on.</p>
<p>“They’d only get in  the way…” The aqua beauty muttered in a voice unlike her own. It  must’ve been Uranus’s words; they were voiced half heartily.</p>
<p>“Are you asking for help?” I felt my eyes narrow at the  suggestive comment.</p>
<p>I could feel her gaze staring with  hardened resolution into the thick fabric. Lifting my face up  slightly, I gazed through the shadow to meet hers.</p>
<p>“Now  that you’ve joined the fight, you’re either an ally or a  casualty.”</p>
<p>At that I leaped backwards onto a section of the  fence that hasn’t been demolished in the previous battle. Neptune  stepped forwards, worry that I’d simply disappear without answering  was evident in her features.</p>
<p>“.Besides, if we fail the enemy  will come after you too now that they know of your  existence.”</p>
<p>“…Next time we meet…You shall receive an  answer then.”</p>
<p><u>Neptune’s POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>“…Next  time we meet…You shall receive an answer.” The figure’s cloak  blew freely in the wind before they fell back behind the fence  barrier.</p>
<p>I stood there, dumbly watching the spot where the  stranger made their exit and pondered the encounter. It was true that  I didn’t receive any truth that Uranus and I searched for, or  learned anything specifically…But at least we potentially have a  new battle companion for the future.</p>
<p>That being didn’t  seem truly evil; the energy they radiated was vastly filled with  anguish and sorrow, not destruction…A past pain, a present hurt,  who knows? Every living thing suffers in their own way as we all  strive for a purpose for existence. If I didn’t have Haruka, I may  very well have turned out like that poor soul. I realize now that  that person…is merely on the edge of falling one way or  another.</p>
<p>“But if I was truly in any danger you would have  come to my rescue wouldn’t you…” I addressed the shadows of a  nearby building. “Uranus?”</p>
<p>There was a bright light as  Haruka de-transformed.</p>
<p>“I guess…” She scratched her head  sheepishly as she emerged from the sheltered camouflage. “You sure  about this Michiru?” Her expression becoming serious again.</p>
<p>“Well,  we do know this being is more than capable of fighting at our  level…And you still absolutely refuse the inner’s help.”</p>
<p>“Sure  they’re strong enough-they are using my power, but can we trust  them?” She stressed.</p>
<p>“I think so.” Even though we just  met, something told me the cloaked figure wouldn’t turn on us. A  strange feeling but call it intuition.</p>
<p>“Oh jeez! We should  be going to practice, it’s in five minutes.” The blonde warned  me, indicating to the gold watch clipped about her wrist.</p>
<p>“Already  that time? Then we must be going.” Immediately I de-transformed as  well.</p>
<p>“C’mon.” Haruka waved me over.</p>
<p>In a  minute we were speeding towards the next adventure of the day on  Haruka’s motorcycle.</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s POV, At the music  hall</u></p>
<p><u></u>We had made it barely on time, no thanks to that  ‘I’ve so superior because I can use your powers’ stranger, who  butted into our fight. No! Must, stop, thinking of that. Shouldn’t  plan to kill possible new help.</p>
<p>“Miss Kaioh? Yes, your  reservation is right here. You’ll find the place down the hall to  your right.” I vaguely heard the receptionist say, although I was  somewhat busy at the moment to actually hear. “Oh and would you  tell your boyfriend to stop banging his head against the  wall?”</p>
<p>“Haruka!”</p>
<p>“Ow, ow, ow!” I yelped as  Michiru pulled me down the hall by my ear.</p>
<p>“I can’t leave  you alone for one second can I?” The aqua goddess chided.</p>
<p>“I  think we should be worrying more about Kaiya.” Michiru gave me ‘the  look’ as she finally released her hold. “Who knows, she may have  forgo-“</p>
<p>I walked ahead of my companion and moved to open  the door for her when a,</p>
<p>“What’s sup?” Greeted us both  unexpectantly.</p>
<p>“K-Kaiya?” She’s actually here…and on  time! Michiru shot me an almost smug ‘what were you saying?’  look. Ignoring it I pretended to clear my throat, just enough to give  me time to regain the ‘too cool for you’ composure. “Glad to  see you here on time squirt.” I walked past Michiru and messed up  the slightly shorter blonde’s hair despite her verbal  protests.</p>
<p>“Hey! Stop, that, you…Grr…”</p>
<p>“Now,  now Haruka.” Michiru giggled. “Be nice.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t  help but grin happily at the sound of her laughter, even if Kaiya was  shooting daggers at me from her glare behind my back.</p>
<p>“Oh,  I see you’re in the performance dress attire. Although it is a bit  unusual, don’t you think she looks cute Haruka?” Michiru  teased.</p>
<p>I looked the other blonde over with a critic eye.  Kaiya looked to be caught between man and woman’s formal  performance wear; instead of a skirt she sported a pair of black  slacks that fitted her nicely I had to admit. As for the shirt, a  simple white blouse with nothing bright or sticking out oddly. I  wouldn’t go as far as cute; she more or less looked clueless. I  almost laughed.</p>
<p>“Yeah…” I stifled a laugh but it still  came out as a chuckle.</p>
<p>“Don’t laugh, the receptionist  gave ‘em to me.” Kaiya’s face turned crimson. Now <em>that</em> expression was cute.</p>
<p>“Sure, whatever you say.” I  teased.</p>
<p>“It’s true!”</p>
<p>“Haruka’s just teasing.”  Michiru bailed the other blonde out. She then turned to peer at the  clock. “We’ll worry about your attire later. Right now we should  be practicing; after all, we only have this place booked for a  limited time.”</p>
<p>“But why do we have to play in these get  ups if it’s just practice?” Kaiya almost whined. She definitely  didn’t find the clothes very comfortable after being picked  on.</p>
<p>“Simply because we’re going to play in them  eventually.” Michi sighed.</p>
<p>“You know, make things as real  to the actual situation as possible.” I added in. The blonde seemed  to understand that explanation much better. “Where’s your  flute?”</p>
<p>“Umm…I sorta forgot it.”</p>
<p>“WHAT!”  Okay, so she was on time but that doesn’t necessarily make her  ‘responsible’.</p>
<p>“It’s alright Haruka, she can borrow  one from the front desk.”</p>
<p>“I guess…” I sighed.</p>
<p>“So  I just ask them for a flute right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”  Michi replied. “Haruka and I will start to set up, come back as  quick as possible okay?”</p>
<p>“You got it.”</p>
<p>At that,  the girl raced out of the door. Almost immediately after I heard it  close with a click.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you’re okay Ruka?”  Michi asked. I turned to see her quietly opening her violin case,  careful not to drop the books she held to her side with her arms.</p>
<p>“Yeah…” I lowered my head, finding the ground suddenly  fascinating. “I didn’t mean to…you know…” My feet shuffled  slightly.</p>
<p>A hand lightly sat on my shoulder, a soft touch  that I could barely feel through the suit. Taking that hand into mine  I slowly turned around to knowingly meet the prettiest aqua eyes I’ve  ever seen in my lifetime. Searching the emotional depths of those  pools I found concern and worry…perhaps something else flickered  there briefly.</p>
<p>“You sure?”</p>
<p>“Yeah…” I nodded  my head and attempted to smile.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to give it  time…” Michi tried to reason with my fears. She paused. “I’m  sure, everything will become clear if we’re patient.”</p>
<p>She  was so close, how I wanted to lean down and plant a kiss on awaiting  soft lips. But I can’t, I can’t; forcing one sided love on  another isn’t love at all.</p>
<p>“Thanks Michi.” So instead, I  embraced the smaller girl in a light hug. Pleasantly I could smell  her perfume, the freshness of the ocean from her aqua locks and the  warmth emitted from her petite body. It was so nice that I didn’t  want to let go. I closed my eyes, letting all sensation sooth the  frustration of the day down to nothing.</p>
<p>“HEEEEEY, I’m  back…?”</p>
<p>Just my luck, Kaiya just barged back in. Michiru  quickly left my arms, her face blushing fiercely. The poor girl went  back to concentrating on the music sheets, placing them in order and  such.</p>
<p>“Did I…interrupt something here?” Kaiya shot me a  look.</p>
<p><em>Did you tell her yet?</em></p>
<p><em>No.</em></p>
<p>“Not at  all Kaiya, we just finished setting up.”</p>
<p>Silently I hoped  she would drop all the questions and that accusing stare of  hers.</p>
<p><em>Would you quit staring!</em></p>
<p>“Well,  since you do have a flute now we can start.” Michi spoke up  finally. With a small smile she motioned for Kaiya to take a seat  beside her. I too sat down but at the piano keyboard. “We should  probably start with the slower pieces first and then work our way up,  right Haruka?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” I agreed. It would give us all a  chance to get back into shape, plus our newest member can catch onto  the routine.</p>
<p>At first we were all a bit off tune but we all  constantly adapted; changing the pitches, pressure on the keys and  even a few notes on the pages themselves. In the end, the room was  truly filled with music- peaceful, calm and soothing melodies that  seemed to stop time itself. Just the three of us together. I  wonder…what Kaiya is thinking right now…</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s  POV, three hours later</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Wow, I didn’t know you  could sing Michiru.” It was very unexpected but a pleasant surprise  none the less. I clapped as she finished the high note.</p>
<p>“Arigato  Kaiya.” Michiru smiled. As the teenager proceeded to refresh  herself with a drink of water Haruka filled me in.</p>
<p>“She’s  been practicing for this one show ever since we got the offer.”</p>
<p>“A  show? Which one?” I almost couldn’t hold back the excitement and  curiosity. Whatever it was, it had to be good; why else would the  normally quiet Michiru practice singing?</p>
<p>“Excited? You  should be, it’s for the family day concert they’re holding next  month.”</p>
<p>“Family…day?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you know…”  Haruka then stopped, probably seeing my downcast expression. “Er…you  don’t?”</p>
<p>“My parents disappeared on me when I was still a  kid.”</p>
<p>“No… brothers or sisters?” Michiru asked as she  knelt down beside the chair I was seated at. She sounded  so…sympathetic.</p>
<p>“An adopted sister…but she’s always  going to meetings. Never home.”</p>
<p>I could see the look on  Michiru’s face grow solemn. It was just like with Makoto, Hisa and  Rei. Why did all these people look sad when they found out? It wasn’t  like it was their family that deserted them.</p>
<p>“Welcome to the  club.” Haruka gave a sad chuckle.</p>
<p>“Say what?”</p>
<p>“Both  of us are on our own as well.”</p>
<p>Michiru stood and walked  past Haruka to one of the room windows. She surveyed the scenery  outside, watching the happy couples with children dally by with daily  activities.</p>
<p>“It’s been awhile since Haruka and I met…”  The aqua beauty whispered. One of her hands lingered over her heart  as she closed her eyes reminiscing.</p>
<p>“A really long  time?”</p>
<p>Haruka nodded her head.</p>
<p>“Yup, but it’s in  the past now, we can’t go back. But… I don’t regret it, I  wouldn’t go back for the world.”</p>
<p>There was another brief  silence.</p>
<p>“They all look so happy, don’t they Haruka?  Kaiya?”</p>
<p>Haruka and I walked over to the window to see what  Michiru was staring thoughtfully at. Crowds of elementary aged  children had just gotten out of school for the day. Dully we heard  the dismissal bell but it was mostly drowned out due to the energetic  of little tykes’ cheers of freedom. A few enthusiastic parents  honked from their car, letting their presence known before exiting  the mechanical vehicles.</p>
<p>They did look happy, smiling faces  everywhere as parent and child embraced each other in a welcoming  hug. Perhaps that’s what home felt like.</p>
<p>“Ever hear of  the sailor scouts Kaiya?” Michiru spoke again.</p>
<p>I merely  nodded my head, too caught up in the happy reunion scenes below  us.</p>
<p>“I believe, this is what they protect.”</p>
<p>“You  really think so Michiru?” I asked.</p>
<p>She turned her head  slightly and looked me in the eye, “I do.”</p>
<p>“If they even  have families I’m sure they would do everything in their power to  protect them as well.” Haruka said her bit as well. Before I could  say anything she also turned to look me in the eye and said, “I do  believe it.”</p>
<p>I wanted to tell them they were wrong but the  words would not come out. They strongly believed in the goodness of  people they’ve never met or knew, even looked me in the eye and  declared it. How…could I say ‘no, you’ve got it all wrong’?</p>
<p>“If…you say so.” I sighed in defeat. “I’ve only  read about them in the news so I don’t know very much.”</p>
<p>“No  one really knows anything about them. To add onto all that, you’re  still fairly new here so it’s expected. Don’t worry about it.”  Michiru reas</p>
<p>sured my ‘ignorance’.  Why does it hurt to lie to them? This pain in my chest…</p>
<p>“But  you know, I heard there was this cloaked figure going around as  well.” I quickly added, hoping the change the topic  somewhat.</p>
<p>“Humph, probably some wannabe superhero.” Haruka  snorted.</p>
<p>That comment made me twitch but I held it back, it  was Haruka after all and she knew nothing about my other identity. So  how could I beat her?</p>
<p>“Really? How do you know they’re not  an evil villain?” I shot back.</p>
<p>“I…I don’t know, if  they were wouldn’t they’ve blown up a building or  something?”</p>
<p>“Then do you think this person is on the  sailor scouts team?”</p>
<p>“WHAT? I seriously doubt it. The  sailor scouts are really strong, like they’d need an outsiders  help.” Haruka brushed aside the notion, leaving Michiru left to  answer. Without knowing it Haruka was putting me down constantly, how  sad; I can’t say anything about it either.</p>
<p>“Who knows  Kaiya, no one knows right?” Michiru started. “But…I’d have to  disagree with Haruka on the latter.”</p>
<p>“What? Really Michi?”  The other blonde questioned with surprise.</p>
<p>“It seems to me  that the sailor scouts are strong and they <em>do</em> have powers…But  they probably need all the help they can get; there’ve been more  monster cases then ever of late. It’s frightening when you think  about it.”</p>
<p>Need all the help they can get huh? Ironic how  Neptune and Uranus won’t accept the inner senshi’s aid.</p>
<p><em>“They’d  only get in the way…”</em></p>
<p>Do those two want my help  because I can use their powers? Either way I can’t escape the  battles now; I’ll be hunted down like Neptune said if they  fail.</p>
<p>“I suppose it is…” I said off-handedly.</p>
<p>There  was a small click and we all turned to face the sound.</p>
<p>“Oh,  pardon me but I believe your time is almost up.” The receptionist  informed us.</p>
<p>“Your right…” Haruka muttered, looking to  her watch. “We’ll be out in a sec. That alright?”</p>
<p>“That’ll  be perfect, thanks.” With that the woman smiled and left.</p>
<p>“Well  I guess that’s a wrap for the day.” Haruka addressed Michiru and  I.</p>
<p>“It may as well, I am a bit exhausted.” Michiru  admitted.</p>
<p>“You guys can go rest but I got some housework to  do where I’m staying.”</p>
<p>“Aww, that bites.” Haruka  pretended to be sorry but her eyes gave it away.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m  suuuure you feel that way Haruka.” The blonde merely laughed. “So  anyway, I guess I’ll talk to you guys later?”</p>
<p>“Count on  it.”</p>
<p>“You bet.”</p>
<p>I turned to leave and had  almost made it to the door before I was called again.</p>
<p>“Hey  Kaiya! Don’t forget to return the flute to the front desk!”  Haruka outstretched her hand with the rental flute in its grasp.</p>
<p>“Oops, almost forgot it.” How embarrassing…I ran back  for it.</p>
<p>“Oh and Kaiya?”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“Umm…you  say it Michiru.”</p>
<p>“On family day, why don’t the three of  us spend it together?”</p>
<p>What…?</p>
<p>“A day for us  orphans.” Haruka grinned. “…Kaiya?”</p>
<p>“OKAY!”</p>
<p>I’ve  never spent family day with anyone before. This one would be my  first. Was it excitement? It felt like there were butterflies in my  stomach . I felt so happy but…Ah, no time to think about that  now.</p>
<p>We all said our farewells and I did return the flute to  the desk, but I did not immediately return to the shrine. I gathered  my schoolbag and cloak from one of the lockers I borrowed and headed  for the city’s main shopping center. If I’m going to do this, I’m  going to do it right…the first time!</p>
<p><u>At the  mall</u></p>
<p>“That’s right, a pair of sunglasses and a  package of hair ties.”</p>
<p>“Would you need prescription for  the glasses?”</p>
<p>“What? No, no thank you. Just the way they  are is fine, thanks.”</p>
<p>“Okay, is that all for today?”</p>
<p>I nodded to the cashier woman.</p>
<p>“Your total comes  to…”</p>
<p>Immediately after I paid I moved quickly out of the  place, carrying a few small bags tightly in my grasp. I suppose I  could’ve placed them in my school bag but it may have proven a bit  space difficult as the cloak mostly took up what the small sack had  to offer. I had been especially cautious to not draw any sort of  suspicion; I had gone and bought all the items in separate stores at  this mall: a light, black long shirt, pair of black cargo pants,  gloves, sunglasses and a package of hair ties. If I integrate all  these items into my disguise no one will be able to identify me with  my hood on or not.</p>
<p>“Last thing to do…” Waltzing over to  a pay phone I picked it up and dialed a memorized number.</p>
<p><em>Briiiiiiing, briiiiiiiiing.</em></p>
<p><em>“</em>Hi, Rei? I’m  going to be late coming home. There’s something I want to check up  at the library so don’t wait up with supper for me.”</p>
<p><em>Because  I’ve finally decided…</em></p>
<p><u>By the waterfront, late  evening</u></p>
<p>Clashes of attacks met the  air.</p>
<p>“Neptune!”</p>
<p>“Uranus, the crystal!”</p>
<p>The  monster previous was back with vengeance, however its face was  exposed without its mask. At its feet lay the soulless body of Kino  Makoto.</p>
<p>“Want this?” It sneered towards Uranus and  Neptune, holding the crystal in its clutches.</p>
<p>“Yeah,  actually I’ll be taking that now!”</p>
<p>Uranus lunged forward  into the barrage of red ribbons. For the first few steps she managed  to evade the attack but faltered on the recent when a ribbon sprung  off the ground and up.</p>
<p>“Gah!”</p>
<p>In an attempt to  prevent herself from falling the senshi of the wind took hold of the  weapon and turned it into a disadvantage for its user.</p>
<p>“Don’t  drop it.” Uranus mocked. She yanked down on the ribbon.</p>
<p>Pulled  slightly off balance the monster shrieked as the crystal jiggled out  of its grip onto the cement pavement a few meters away. Fortunately  no damage had been done to the jewel; it merely hovered over the  ground quietly, waiting for someone to claim it as their prize.</p>
<p>“You  annoying…” The monster cried. “Pests should be put out of their  misery.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t agree more.” Neptune stated.  “Deep…SUBMERGE!”</p>
<p>“World…SHAKING!”</p>
<p>The two  partner’s attacks hurled straight towards the youma who stood its  ground.</p>
<p>“Think that’ll defeat me?” It sneered as the  attacks closed distance.</p>
<p>“World…SHAKING!” The previous  attacks were joined by a third bright light.</p>
<p>“Wha…<strong>WhaAaAaT</strong>?”  It shrieked, its final death cry.</p>
<p>“Neptune, the crystal! Is  it?” Uranus asked.</p>
<p>“No…it’s not what we’re looking  for.”</p>
<p>“Maybe not, but that did…” I muttered,  remembering the monster’s last comment.</p>
<p>“You again!”  Uranus growled as I stepped out of my hiding spot.</p>
<p>Before she  could say another word I pulled back my hood to stare at the two  partners through my black shades. The glasses themselves, to my  liking, they covered my eyes effectively and were neither too dark  nor light in shading. A strong wind blew across the area at that  moment but my hair did not go spraying in all directions as it would  normally; it was now that I had the blonde strands up in a ponytail  for the first time since I’ve arrived here.</p>
<p>I held my hand  out, asking for the crystal.</p>
<p>“Your answer?” Neptune  inquired.</p>
<p>“<em>On family day, why don’t the three of us  spend it together”</em></p>
<p><em>“You know, a day for us orphans”</em></p>
<p>“I  have…family to protect.”</p>
<p>Haruka, Michiru, Hotaru, Hisa,  Yuuchiro, Rei, Makoto …</p>
<p>Neptune finally passed me the  crystal. With great care I walked over and allowed the object to  return to its rightful owner. The girl gasped a large gulp of air as  the jewel disappeared.</p>
<p>Makoto…</p>
<p><em>“I have someone  to protect now.”</em></p>
<p>I’ll fight for them, the people that  are special to me. I looked to the duo that I would work with from  here on. As for you two…I still reserve judgement.</p>
<p>“Welcome to the  group…”</p>
<p>“From now on, it’s <u>our</u> fight”</p>
