<p>“<em>All  right, all right! I'll say it okay! I've fallen in love with  Ami-chan!”</em></p>
<p><em>The distinct  sound of footsteps at the door, fading away slowly... before seeming  to pound against the wood, the owner running away from the scene.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Ami-chan!”</em></p>
<p>Minako  and Rei exchanged glances as Makoto ran out of the room. Usagi looked  puzzled a moment, before a knowing grin spread across her lips.  “Ehh... I always had a feeling there was something there...”</p>
<p>At  that, the two listeners blinked and looked at her.</p>
<p>Noticing,  Usagi's big eyes blinked slowly. “W...what? Why are you looking at  me like that?”</p>
<p>Rei  and Minako inched closer to her on either side, eyes narrowed in  concentration. Usagi attempted to back away, but then Rei was behind  her, still on this side, and Minako was right in front of her,  towards the other side.</p>
<p>“Usagi...”</p>
<p>“W...what is it  Minako-chan?”</p>
<p>“It's time to spill your  guts.”</p>
<p>Usagi  went pale, imagining her soul coming out from her mouth at Rei's  suggestion.</p>
<p>And  then Minako giggled and smiled warmly at her. Usagi exhaled in soft  relief.</p>
<p>But  it was just a face, just one of an actress. “U-sa-gi-ch—an... You  know I've been gone a lo—ng time, right—?” She paused, waiting  for Usagi's apprehensive nod. “Well then, it would be to our best  interest if you explained yourself right now.”</p>
<p>Rei  added, “As soon as possible.” She placed a forefinger at Usagi's  side for emphasis. <em>Or else the Tickle Monster comes out to play  again.</em></p>
<p>“Alright, alright, geez! I  would've told you anyway- stop trying to scare me! What do you want  to know?”</p>
<p>Minako  and Rei shared a glance, Rei grinning as she took the unspoken hint  to back off. Minako did as well, calmly taking a sip from her now  cold tea.</p>
<p>Usagi  looked at them warily, as if she fully expected the pair to jump her  at any given time. For purposes she didn't even want to imagine (even  though she started to before she could stop herself). She looked  around, wishing Mako-chan and Ami-chan would come back already.  “W-well?”</p>
<p>Rei,  also calmly sipping tea, looked up and gestured for Minako to answer.</p>
<p>Minako,  with a soft sigh given on the pretense of enjoying the last of her  tea, set her cup down. When she suddenly turned her eyes on Usagi,  Usagi went rigid from head to foot. She wasn't fooled by the smile  this time (even though this smile was genuine, despite looking  exactly the same).</p>
<p>“Please tell us what you  meant about this 'feeling' of yours regarding our Mako-chan and  Ami-chan.”</p>
<p>“What...” Usagi looked at  Rei. “You didn't know either?”</p>
<p>Agitated,  Rei fixed her gaze straight ahead. Minako watched her with nonchalant  grace, as if she were only looking because Rei was directly in front  of her.</p>
<p>Usagi  seemed agog with disbelief as she looked between her two comrades,  threats temporarily absent from her mind. “The  Fire-Fortune-Teller-Priestess and the Idol-of-Love... neither of you  knew at all?”</p>
<p>Neither  Rei nor Minako moved. They wished they could object... but it was  somehow too close for them to notice.</p>
<p>Usagi  suddenly laughed, “Well that actually shouldn't surprise me at all.  Minako's been out of close contact with all of us for so long, I  can't blame her- it's a comparatively new development. And Rei...”  Usagi started giggling. “Someone as close as her best friend could  have fallen in love with her and she wouldn't have the slightest  clue- Rei-chan's really so dense after all...”</p>
<p>And  just like that, Usagi did the impossible. She froze time.</p>
<p>Rei  and Minako only continued casually gazing at each other... though  their eyes were wide, their lips parted in momentary shock.</p>
<p><em>It couldn't  be... and yet... no... impossible...</em></p>
<p>------(  )O.o() -- Crazy Pooch...</p>
<p>“Ami-chan! Wait up!”</p>
<p>Ami  heard the voice in the distant proximity, but she kept running,  wishing she was anywhere near as athletic or in shape as her pursuer.</p>
<p><em>It's no good... I can't...  run anymore...</em> Ami slowed down, a hand touching a tree's trunk  off the path leading to the shrine steps. She could hear the  barely out of breath exhales of the one who had stopped not far  behind her.</p>
<p>“Ami...”</p>
<p><em>Why? To say it like that... why? And why now?</em></p>
<p>Makoto laughed, failing horribly at  trying to hide her unease. “I guess... you heard, huh? I'm sorry...  that you had to hear something like that that way...”</p>
<p>“Then it's true?” It seemed to stop her, so Ami turned around  to look at her. She couldn't help instinct, her mouth, once unjammed,  started flying a mile a minute, trying to get out everything that was  confusing to her at that moment in time. “Why, Mako-chan? If you  had to say it, why say... <em>that</em> tonight? You're married now.  Even if you weren't, it's not right... feeling that way... I...” I  turned my head away, helplessly ashamed that the memory was  resurfacing again, a dream blend with reality in her mind. “You had  to have known... that I... that I don't feel the same way.”</p>
<p>Makoto paused, as if caught off guard. Then, a forlorn smile  spread across her lips as she bowed her head for a moment, and then  flicked her hair back as she looked straight up at the moon. “I  know. Of course I know. How could I not? And I know I was late in  realizing it.” Makoto lowered her eyelids a little as she kicked a  pebble. With a loud sigh, her fingers laced together behind her head  as she spun away from Ami.</p>
<p>“The saddest thing about it really... more than knowing from the  start that it was unrequited and yet more fulfilling than any other  time I've even crushed on anybody... more than the thought of loving  another girl like <em>that</em>...”</p>
<p>Makoto stopped moving, her hands limply  falling to her sides. She decided to hold the bull by the horns and  pivoted to face Ami with a small smile. “The worst part of it all  is... I only started realizing something was off... when I realized  you were so late that you had completely missed my wedding. And you  had to leave early at the reception...”</p>
<p>Ami looked away, guilty. <em>Why did she  have to bring that up...</em></p>
<p>“Ami... can you just tell me one thing? Did you really miss it  because of work?”</p>
<p>Ami didn't look up for a moment, but  when she did, there was a soft smile on her face.</p>
<p>“Of course. Mako-chan... you'll always be a close friend of  mind. Short of a crisis, I wouldn't have missed your big day for  anything. They... they needed me.”</p>
<p>Before Ami could really recognize it,  Makoto had closed the distance between them. “Ami... if that was  true... then tell me why...” Makoto made as if to caress Ami's  cheek, but stopped herself an inch from succeeding. Her hand dropped  back to her side. “Tell me why your eyes look so sad right now.”</p>
<p>Ami was held mesmerized by Makoto's  gaze for two seconds longer than she should have been able to stand.  That said, when she pulled out of Makoto's atmospheric magnetic  field, she had to turn to hide her flushed cheeks, not knowing Makoto  had already noticed them.</p>
<p>When Makoto didn't say or do anything  more. Ami gathered her breath and whispered, “What do you expect?  How would <em>you</em> feel if you suddenly heard that your best friend  was in love with you?”</p>
<p>There was a pregnant pause, enough to  make Ami start to turn around. But just as she was completing the  turn, she was stopped dead in her tracks by Makoto's solemn, yet  thoughtful response.</p>
<p>“I'm not all too certain... I mean, Ami-chan, at the end of the  day, you'll always be the best of my friends.”</p>
<p>------ M(n.n)M –Peace!</p>
<p>“Uh... guys? You know I was kidding, right?”</p>
<p>Minako and Rei snapped out of it. At  the same time, they stuttered, “What? Y-yeah, of course I knew  that!”</p>
<p>Usagi looked at them with open doubt.  “Really?”</p>
<p>The pair nodded, purposely not looking  at each other. Rei shifted, “Now stop delaying, Usagi. What about  Makoto and Ami?”</p>
<p>Usagi sighed, nibbling on the last  pastry, knowing it had to last the longest. “Well... I guess I  started noticing it... A few months after the wedding- ah,  Mako-chan's I mean. Mm... Ami-chan apparently went to Mako-chan's new  house to help organize all the boxes that hadn't gotten put away  right after the move... and the next time I saw them... I don't  know... the... mood between them was closer. A lot closer than  before. Almost...” Usagi paused, thinking of how to phrase it. “Ah,  almost as if they had become best friends overnight or something.”</p>
<p>Rei sighed. She knew all too well how  that was. She didn't know when something had flickered inside her,  changing concern for the Princess' wellbeing to worry for someone who  irked her far more than Usagi ever did with her daily antics.</p>
<p>Minako idly watched Rei, though she  mainly kept her eyes on Usagi. “Is that it? Come on, that doesn't  mean anything. Becoming closer isn't at all the same as falling in  love.” <em>Though one could very well lead to the other... given  time and fortunate circumstances.</em></p>
<p>“No, that's not all! I'm just getting started!” The gleam in  Usagi's eyes just then made Minako and Rei very wary indeed. It just  went to show... don't underestimate a determined gossip and meddler.</p>
<p>They tried stopping it.</p>
<p>They honestly tried to think of any  sensible reason as to refute her claims.</p>
<p>But it was no good.</p>
<p>By the time forty-five minutes had  passed, the pair was thoroughly convinced of the situation.</p>
<p>That is, if Usagi hadn't exaggerated to  the point of lying anywhere or everywhere.</p>
<p>As this notion came upon both Minako  and Rei, their mutual cold, suspicious stare rooted Usagi to her spot  again. “Uh... Mako-chan and Ami-chan are taking an awfully long  time, aren't they? We... we should go check up on them, don't you  think?”</p>
<p>They all paused.</p>
<p>Usagi waited with baited breath for the  verdict.</p>
<p>Minako protested softly, “But what if  it turns out that Ami-chan actually returns Mako-chan's feelings and  they went off to have a lovey-dovey moment?”</p>
<p>Rei raised an eyebrow dubiously.  “'Lovey-dovey'?”</p>
<p>Minako huffed, waving it away. “Oh  stop it; you know what I mean.”</p>
<p>Rei shook her head, inwardly smiling,  before she objected, “But on the other hand, they could have also  gotten into trouble. Run into the street at a bad time or something.”</p>
<p>Usagi whined, “Rei-cha—n! Don't <em>say</em> that! You'll jinx them! Ahhh... what do we do... if something <em>did</em> happen to them it'd be all our fault...”</p>
<p>Rei blinked. “Come again?”</p>
<p>Minako motioned that those were her  sentiments exactly.</p>
<p>Usagi explained in a voice to match her  pout, “If we hadn't tickled Mako-chan into saying that, then  Ami-chan wouldn't have heard, and so Ami-chan wouldn't have run off,  and so Mako-chan wouldn't have run after her, and so they would have  been here, safe and sound. See?”</p>
<p>The room went silent again.</p>
<p>“In that case, it should be Minako's fault for arranging for us  to all meet here.”</p>
<p>“Me! Why me? Is it so wrong to want to see all my old friends  together?”</p>
<p>Rei continued, “If you hadn't decided  to meet here, today, Ami-chan might have come at a different time,  thus avoiding the tickling confession and conversation altogether,  therefore throwing off everything that came after that.”</p>
<p>Minako huffed in indignant silence  before she could find enough voice to rebuff, “Well if <em>that's</em> the way it is then maybe it's Rei-chan's fault for closing and  locking the door and preventing us from seeing that Ami-chan was  there.”</p>
<p>“Oh please- the way we were, you wouldn't have seen her even if  she <em>was</em> visible at the doorway.”</p>
<p>After five minutes of this prattle back  and forth, Usagi slapped her hands on the table, and then promptly  withdrew them, mumbling about how much that actually hurt. Shaking  herself out of habit as the two stopped, she directed, “Oh stop  that, you two! Let's just go look for them- if they haven't decided  to leave altogether, they should be nearby. We'll just go for a  distant visual check- if they're okay, we'll come back alone; if  they're not, we'll go check on them and get help and all that. Okay?  Can we go?”</p>
<p>The two couldn't help but stare at  Usagi.</p>
<p>She grew uncomfortable again. “W-what?”</p>
<p>Rei snickered for a moment as Minako  grinned and asked slyly, “What a surprise; you came off your sugar  high <em>already</em>?”</p>
<p>Usagi paused, until she realized Minako  was teasing her for being so different when she was in the presence  of sweets. “Minako-cha—n!”</p>
