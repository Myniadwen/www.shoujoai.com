<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The shuttle  touched down gingerly in a concrete jungle that somehow seemed at peace  in its green and blue surroundings. Inside the craft, the Princess and  her aide prepared to meet the Earthlings when Mars suddenly stumbled to  her knees.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei!” Minako, disguised as Princess Serenity, rushed to the Martian’s side.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars gripped her head. “The dark energy… it’s very strong here. My senses are clouded.” Her gloved hands formed tight fists.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  shuttle doors slid open with an audible rush of air. Forcing a neutral  expression to her face, Mars rushed to her feet. Settling on a stony  mask of indifference, she pulled Minako upright with her. “Let’s go,  Princess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Exiting the shuttle, the women blinked. The sun’s  influence on Earth was deceptively strong, despite its thick  atmosphere. When the spots in their eyes had faded and they had  adjusted to the brightness, Mars found Endymion had wasted no time.  Standing tall in front of them, he tightly clasped the Princess’ hands.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Serenity, it’s so good to see you again. Thank you for agreeing to come to our humble planet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The pleasure’s all mine, Endymion.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian felt her hackles rise. <em>‘He thinks she’s Serenity.’</em> She reminded herself. It was a running mantra that repeated itself in  an endless loop as the image of her Princess smiled in Endymion’s  direction. Turning, she slipped an arm into the crook of his waiting  elbow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Just off the landing platform, Beryl and the shitennou  stood waiting. It was no small amount of comfort that they seemed  equally displeased with the display of affection. Mars focused her  scathing gaze on them instead.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Princess,” Beryl’s smile was more  akin to a sneer as the three descended the landing platform. Cold eyes  met the crimson warrior. “Mars?” She asked, making no attempt to hide  her disappointment. “I expected the little Venusian.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian sneered. “She had other matters of importance to attend to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah,  sou.” The tactician affected a casual shrug. Mars watched her  suspiciously, and the tall human spun around to lead the group while  saying over her shoulder, “Well, allow us to show you our capital city  of Edo, Princess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Gesturing grandly, a history lesson that  refused to be absorbed ensued as Beryl led them through the capital.  The Earth truly was a paradise among planets, but the two foreigners  had no time to admire its clear blue sky and abundant greenery, which  thrived even in this bustling metropolis made of old fashioned stone  and new age concrete and steel.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The shitennou trailed along  behind the others, doggedly distracted. Endymion proudly paraded the  Princess around on his arm. How he was oblivious to the disapproving  glances directed at them from both the city’s civilians and his own  party seemed a wonder to Mars, who kept on the alert for any signs of  trouble from the unpleased crowd.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Cold eyes lighted on Mars’ dark form. Beryl allowed Endymion to distract Serenity so she could approach the Martian discreetly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  see how they look at them, don’t you.” She gestured to where the Prince  was proudly showing the Princess small, shiny trinkets from a  street-side vendor. Serenity smiled and giggled. The Martian’s eyes  hardened.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Beryl sneered at the crimson warrior. “It’s probably a  good thing that Venus isn’t here. They might hate her even more than  your pretty little Princess, being the warrior of love and beauty and  what have you.” A laugh like nails on a chalkboard made the woman  before her visibly shiver. “They think your kind cares only for  themselves and beautiful things, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minako… Venus isn’t like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Beryl  raised an amused eyebrow. She pondered toying with her substitute Venus  a while longer, but those amethyst eyes suddenly shot toward the canopy  of the trees above. Her gaze followed suit, and she pondered at what  might have caught the Martian’s interest when the sudden scream of a  thousand birds pulled everyone else’s attention in the same direction,  and as one, a mass of black-winged birds took to the sky.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A warning.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  ground beneath their feet trembled. Endymion threw his arms around  Serenity. Mars had to force herself to hold her ground. Citizens  panicked. Screams rang through the street. The shitennou crowded around  Beryl. People dropped to their knees and covered their heads. Dust  filled the air.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The trembling stopped.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The screaming  subsided. Serenity subtly pulled herself from Endymion’s arms and  inched towards Mars. The shitennou scattered away from the tactician.  Those citizens who had dropped to the ground slowly rose. Accusing eyes  turned to the representatives of the Moon Kingdom, and to their Prince.  Beryl smirked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was only a minor earthquake. There’s no reason  to be… afraid.” Beryl faltered when she turned to Serenity,  disappointed to see not the slightest amount of fear in the Princess’  strong, cerulean gaze.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is a symptom of the increase in ecological disasters?” The Princess asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Beryl nodded. “…yes.” She recovered quickly. “Perhaps this is enough excitement for one day. Let us retire, shall we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  decision was deferred to the Princess, who nodded her approval  gracefully. The return to the Edo Palace was a quiet one, and much to  the discomfort of both the Princess and Mars, it was Beryl who showed  them to their suites. The tall woman led the way, too many paces in  front of them, her curly, red hair swaying between her shoulder blades,  and every step Serenity and Mars made sounded too loud to their ears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At  length, Beryl stopped in front of a large, wooden door. “Your suites  are just down this hallway. I hope you find your stay here comfortable,  ladies.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Princess bowed her head slightly. “Thank you for your hospitality, tactician.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Very slowly, Beryl smiled. “You’re quite welcome, <em>Princess Serenity</em>.&quot;</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  door clicked shut behind them. Immediately, Mars prowled the room,  searching for traps, cameras, anything out of the ordinary. With  fingers idly trailing over any obstacle that crossed her path, Minako  made a beeline for an open courtyard at the end of a wooden porch on  the other side of opened sliding doors.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After what felt like too long, she finally felt Mars at her back.  The Martian’s form was stiff and alert, but she placed a strong arm  around Minako’s middle, and the Venusian allowed the other woman’s  gentle strength to relax her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We can’t see if from here.” Minako said distractedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The Moon.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars’  gaze left her lover to reach upwards; beyond the koi pond, beyond the  rock garden, beyond the leafy boughs of the ancient maples. There was  no moon in the clear, dark sky. But there was one other bright point of  golden light in the night sky that was not a star at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Venus still shines brightly here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They  call it the evening star at this time of night.” Minako said. Her eyes  drifted closed as Mars’ arms tightened around her waist.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stupid humans.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako snickered, but found herself being spun in the Martian’s embrace and then eased back against the porch railing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wanted to rip him apart, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Endymion?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  very name made that possessive streak inside Rei flare. She had only  claimed Minako as her own the night before, but to be under such stress  and restraint given their mission was sorely bothering her. She leaned  forward and her breath mingled with the Venusian’s.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But Mars pulled back abruptly. Minako’s eyes fluttered open slowly. A frown turning at her lips, she searched for answers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars  poked a finger at the false crescent moon mark on the other woman’s  forehead. Her Venusian looked too much like her Princess. She shook her  head by means of explanation. “I… can’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako smiled sweetly. “I’m glad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Venusian reached up, and with nimble fingers, released the intricate  pins that held her hair up in Serenity’s distinctive style. First one  side, and then the other, her long, golden hair fell in wavy sheets to  her waist. Finally, she pulled the offending golden symbol from her  forehead.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Better?” She whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars smirked. A crimson  light enveloped her and she closed her eyes against the tingle of her  destransformation. Rei grinned at Minako, and this time, she didn’t  hesitate as she leaned in.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But this time, <em>she</em> was stopped by a firm finger on her lips and mischievous eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  winked at Rei and slipped from her hold. The Venusian sauntered back  inside and found the suite’s spacious bathroom. Over her shoulder, she  caught the Priestess’ predatory gaze.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll be in the shower, if you want me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She slipped into the room. The sound of running water soon reached Rei’s ears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Understanding finally dawned on the Martian, and she bolted after her partner with a lecherous smirk.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
There was an urgent beep at the breakfast table.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Four sets of curious eyes scanned the room. Serenity fidgeted and  did her best to discreetly glance at the device clasped in her hands  under the table’s edge.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Haruka, Michiru, Ami, and Makoto  exchanged suspicious glances that were confirmed by their Princess’  sudden gasp. Watery, blue eyes beseeched her guardians.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Endymion…” there was a pregnant pause, “he’s going to meet <em>Serenity</em> in her chambers.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Princess of the Moon found her four guardians instantly surrounding  her. Makoto pulled her chair away from the table. Haruka snatched the  small object from her palm. She paled at the text message meant for the  Princess’ eyes only.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You should have told us about this.” The Uranian scolded sharply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This isn’t the time for arguments!” Ami snapped.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serenity snatched the device back quickly. Haruka didn’t put up a fight.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We have to alert Minako.” Michiru urged.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto was already on it. Her hand held before her, her chronometer blinked to no avail. “Why won’t they answer!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You tried them both?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">An uncomfortable silence rested heavily on their shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Michiru’s arms settled across her chest. “We’ll just have to trust that they’ll be able to keep up the façade.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A fork skirted the edge of a porcelain plate and worried eyes caught worried gazes.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Rei’s lips paused on Minako’s collarbone.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei, what-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Priestess placed the sound;  boots on the wooden decking outside their suite. She hopped off the  bed. Hurriedly, she tossed some clothes in Minako’s direction and in a  crimson glow, Mars headed for the courtyard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But it was too late. The damage had been done.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A bouquet of red roses hit the wooden planks, forgotten. “Seren…ity?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Endymion’s  form stood hesitantly in the doorway, his dark eyes trained on the  shadowed form of the one on the bed that he had expected to be Princess  Serenity. Loose, long blonde hair was similar, but not the same. Blue,  worried eyes were just a shade off. Rising from the bed, she held the  ends of a shirt that was a couple inches too long – as though it  belonged to someone else - closely to her to her thighs. The body,  slightly shorter, barely slimmer, was different than the one he knew.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Endymion’s  eyes darted around flightily. Mars lunged forward. The Prince had  strength, but she had speed, and he quickly found himself pinned to the  wall with Mars’ sword held between their bodies warningly. He couldn’t  help but notice that there was a carefully restrained rage in those  amethyst eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Venus… Minako-san.” He whispered, his eyes once again trained on the one who was not his Princess.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Congratulations.” Mars growled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  approached the crimson warrior’s side and laid a restraining hand on  her shoulder. Amethyst eyes lost their edge, but the sword remained  firm.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?” One word. It was all the Prince of Earth felt he would be allowed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We couldn’t have sent Serenity here with only one protector. Not given the circumstances. Surely, you must understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is a great risk you’re taking, Venus.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know, but we do it for <em>her</em>.” Minako noted the reluctant understanding she found in Endymion’s dark eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But if Beryl were to find out-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars’ sword pressed closer to the Earthling. “Beryl this, Beryl that – <em>who</em> is the ruler of this damned planet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Endymion’s dark eyes hardened. “The situation is not so simple, Mars.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Try  us.” Minako pressed. Endymion’s gaze focused on the weapon before him.  A hand on Mars’ elbow prompted the Martian to withdraw her sword. She  hesitatingly sheathed it, but felt the flames of her powers burning at  her fingertips, ready and willing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Prince sighed. “Beryl is  not only tactician, but aide and viceroy. Her decisions and suggestions  weigh heavily on the shitennou. I find them more attentive to <em>her</em> these days.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So the man <em>isn’t</em> blind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako let that one slip and didn’t reprimand the Martian.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s  little I can do.” Endymion’s hands balled into tight fists. “I may be  Prince, but the lands of Earth themselves – divided among the shitennou  - are ruled by them respectively.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then that makes you nothing more than a figurehead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Prince reluctantly turned his gaze from Minako’s harsh truth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars’ expression turned thoughtful. “Beryl aside, or perhaps it is Beryl <em>herself</em>… there’s something… not right here. As protector of this planet, you must feel it too, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Through gritted teeth, Endymion replied. “I do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then Endymion, let us work together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Prince’s downcast gaze held a glimmer of hope, and Minako offered the slightest of smiles.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Excuse me.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serenity slipped away from her senshi. Even in her own courtyard,  there was little privacy when her warriors were keeping a close watch  over her. Standing behind a pillar, the Princess fished inside her  dress for the device Endymion had given her. At least she’d found its  silent mode. She gasped when she read Endymion’s message.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-You could have told me-</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her fingers typed her reply furiously. –I couldn’t I’m sorry-</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-I understand but I wish it was you down here-</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-As do I my love-</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was a pause. Serenity grew restless. –You’ll help us then-</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-Of course my dear I’m sorry things had to happen this way-</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Another pause.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-Serenity?-</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  the Princess of the Moon Kingdom had once again hid the device in her  dress and donned her plastic smile, for her senshi had found her.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The second day of deliberations had proved to be as fruitless as the first.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serenity pushed aside several propositions for peacekeeping  speeches. Instead, she turned to the shitennou; the ever present,  frequently silent force who’s only purpose seemed to be to loom over  proceedings darkly and to keep an eye on Beryl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What of the research of the youma on the Earth’s pole? Have any efforts been made to begin this initiative?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kunzite scowled. “Our scientists are ironing out the logistics.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  have your scientists received Mercury’s reports regarding the  phenomenon of the sunspots? There was another minor earthquake this  morning, and a rather more serious one several hours ago. The weather  now may also be related.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As if on cue, gale force winds howled  outside the battered down windows. The room’s lights dimmed, flickered,  and then reestablished themselves.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Beryl frowned all too  knowingly. “I assure you, Princess, all efforts are being made to  incorporate the Moon’s findings with our own. We have researchers  working twenty-four seven on this effort.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Princess’ brow furrowed, “But I can-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With  a click and a deafening thud of generators coming to a screeching halt,  the power failed and the room was bathed in darkness. Under the table,  Minako reached for Mars’ hand. Scrambling and curses ensued as the  shitennou searched for a lantern.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was a glowing fire that  finally shed a flickering, dancing light in the room once again, and it  was born from Mars’ free hand, a tongue of flame hovering in her open  palm.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Beryl pulled her fingers from her temple hurriedly and  forced her squinted, pain filled eyes to open wide. Mars was staring  straight at her. The tactician smiled with thin, white lips, and rose  to her feet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Given the circumstances, I think we should call an end to the day’s meetings.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
They  sat out the worst of the raging storm in their suite. It was only Mars’  small flame and the flickering blue-white lightening that lit the  large, dark space, the frequent flashes of lightening serving only to  draw bold shadows out of the darkness.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s deliberate.” Minako passed Mars’ rigid, watchful form, turned, and paced back for another round.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Un.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’re stalling on purpose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Two days and we’ve done absolutely <em>nothing</em> of worth!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars nodded silently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m tired of these politics.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amethyst eyes hardened.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m tired of waiting for them to make a <em>move</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They won’t, Minako.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do we do?” Minako’s words were a troubled whisper.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian’s brow furrowed. “We do what we wanted to all along. We go to the pole ourselves and get the proof that we need.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  worried her bottom lip. If they were caught, they’d be risking more  than just their lives, they’d be risking their alliance with the Earth.  If they did go, they might find answers. If they didn’t, they risked  only more questions to add to their ever growing list. The flame in  Mars’ palm faltered in the slightest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally, Minako nodded. “Let’s do it.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
When Mars opened her eyes, she found herself in a frozen wasteland of snow and ice as far as the eye could see.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It worked.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus tentatively opened her eyes. The mingling  of their red and orange auras faded and she reluctantly unlaced her  fingers from the Martian’s.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sailor Teleport. I’ve never tried it with only one other senshi. Usually, we need the strength of at least three.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wonder if the others can do it in pairs as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maa.”  Venus looked thoughtful. She began walking in the deep snow, but was  halted by a restraining hand on her wrist. She turned to her partner in  question.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let’s try not to get in a fight with the youma this time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus sucked her teeth and grinned. “Oh, you’re no <em>fun</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minako…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you recall, I avoided a fight on Venus all together. I snuck in, did some reconnaissance, and got out undetected.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian cocked a hand on her hip. “What are you trying to say?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maybe it’s <em>you</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars  only frowned at the causal barb, but she couldn’t ignore the nagging  thought; certainly, the darkness wouldn’t be attuned to one of the  light like Venus, but could the darkness actively be seeking <em>her</em> out? The next thing she knew, her grip around her commander’s wrist was  reversed, and she was being tugged forward, even as her mind kept  running.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The darkness…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars crumpled to her knees.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  crimson warrior gritted her teeth, her fingers clawed into the snow.  Long, raven bangs hid squinted eyes. “It’s nearly overwhelming.” She  panted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dark energy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars could only nod. “The energy  that the youma have been collecting from the populations of the rest of  our planets… it’s concentrated here, as though they’re hoarding it for  something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars’ frame shook, and she paused. Venus pressed her  body against the other woman’s reassuringly. “But there’s something…  else here. Another power. A… darker power.” Gloved hands shot to her  forehead and Mars bit her lip to suppress a scream. Quickly, she  struggled to rebuild the walls around her senses, an attempt to block  out the worst of the evil‘s painful effects without closing off her  powers all together.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shakily, she rose. Venus’ hands clutched her  arms, steadying her. Mars brushed her off and walked forward. The  crimson warrior didn’t want the other woman to experience the extent of  that pain by siphoning it from her senses.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lets go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  didn’t have far to travel, but they didn’t find exactly what they’d  expected, either. They found less, but they also found more. Their  bodies pressed tightly against the cover of an outcropping of rock,  Mars and Venus peered at the youma camp.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So few?” Venus asked of the couple hundred youma that milled around the camp’s center. “Is Earth not their base after all?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It must be.” Mars indicated the wealth of permanent structures erected around the camp. “The <em>humans</em> must at least conduct operations from here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then the youma-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>They</em> are not from this planet. They must be being funneled from some other  place. If only we knew where the access point was pointing to, where  they’re coming from.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus frowned. Her eyes focused on the sun,  high in the sky. She noted that its rays were intensely warm despite  the bitterly cold air. She frowned, and then held her chronometer in  front of her. “Mercury. Do you copy me?” She called quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars turned, her eyes wide. “What are you-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is Mercury.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell me, should the sun be visible at the Earth’s pole right now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">”Venus,” Mercury’s voice bordered on suspicion, “where are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Answer the question, Mercury.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was a moment of silence. The Venusian could imagine the Mercurian’s  blue super computer coming to life under the genius’ fingertips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Negative.” Mercury responded. “The sun should not be visible due to the Earth’s axial tilt.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then tell me why I can see it in the middle of the sky, Ami-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">More silence. This one was longer, and punctuated by much more typing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  she’d checked and double checked her result, Mercury’s voice was a  hoarse whisper. “It looks like it’s more than just the sunspots  affecting the Earth. The planet’s axis is shifting… so that the pole is  beginning to lean towards the sun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The golden warrior nodded sharply. “Thank you, Mercury, that’s all I needed. Venus ou-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ll have some explaining to do later, Venus.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian smirked. “I know. Venus out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus  slapped her partner on the back. “Did you get all that-“ Her breath  hitched in her throat, for Mars suddenly looked so very pale.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The humans,” Mars whispered, “they’re here too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">From  the relative safety of their hiding spots, Mars and Venus’ chronometers  provided magnified images of their line of sight. Four men poured out  of a building in a tight, single file line. Venus gasped. “Is that-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The shitennou.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But how did they get here so quickly?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How did <em>we</em> get here so quickly?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus hesitated, not wanting to voice her suspicion. “They must have magics similar to ours.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally, one other figure exited the building behind the four men. The Venusian nearly growled. “Beryl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars  had seen, and Mars had heard, but her consciousness was suddenly very,  very far away. Blindly, she reached to her commander, and pulled her  partner towards her until their foreheads touched.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nearing a trance-like state, Mars slowly shut her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>A  red haired woman stood with her face tilted towards a black sky. A  golden sword had skewered her through her stomach, and dark blood  spilled from the wound, but this did not halt the maniacal laughter  that erupted from her sneering mouth. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Her arms extended above her. The black sky parted. The sun - large, and orange, and angry - filled the void in the clouds. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The wound that should have taken her life </em>came<em> to life.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>A  monster made of shadow emerged from around the sword’s blade. Darker  than night and with little form more than an undefined shape with vague  red eyes and a gaping mouth, the creature grew, stretching its  incorporeal arms as if released from a long slumber. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It  seemed to take stock of its surroundings for a brief moment, but then  with a snarl, it leapt upwards, and dived into the woman’s gaping,  laughing mouth, and in that one, wonderful moment, that maniacal  laughter ceased.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The red haired woman brought her dark  gaze parallel to the ground. Her eyes flashed red, her hands gripped  the sword’s blade, and she effortlessly pulled the weapon from her  abdomen.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>There was no blood.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly, Mars released her hold on Venus.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Cerulean eyes blinked back tears.”That was… Beryl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And the one controlling her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was… a premonition?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars could only nod numbly.</span></p>

Author’s Notes:
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yay, plot! More political intrigue, so, depending on how much one  likes politics (personally, I’m not a fan), this chapter was either a  total bore, or pretty useful.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">O O O</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Preview, Chapter 11: Your Weakness</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  young wisp of a man paused on his way past the guest chambers. He  hadn’t meant to eavesdrop, but always eager to please the one he deemed  his leader, he wasn’t beyond claiming any opportunity that happened his  way, either.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He could hear muffled voices just beyond the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m opening the door now. Can you behave yourself for a little while?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know, can <em>you</em>?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was a long suffering sigh. The door finally opened. The conversation  itself could have been interpreted many different ways, but when  Princess Serenity grabbed Sailor Mars’ wrist and pulled the other woman  towards her for what she promised was “just one last kiss”, Jadeite’s  blue eyes widened, and with red cheeks, he took to his heels.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Darting  down hallways at full speed, he turned corners until he was out of  breath. Breeching protocol, he barged into Beryl’s chambers.</span></p>
