<h1>Con Su Adios, Usted Toma Con Usted Mi Co (part 8 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/adios-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>The weekend after Minako&#39;s birthday was the concert Makoto was helping 
Yuuchirou with. It had been post poned for unknown reasons and re 
scheduled. Both Yuuchirou and Makoto were happy for the change, seeing 
as they needed more time to practice. 

&quot;Whats the concert for any way,&quot; Minako asked, sitting in the window 
seat in the practice room the temple held. 

&quot;Chairty,&quot; Makoto said, glacing over sheets of music, playing a few 
keys every now and then.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Minako said. The last practice session was now over, the concert 
was the following night. Everyone had gone home to bed, except Makoto 
who had locked herself up in the room, and Minako decided last minute 
to stay.

&quot;What kind of chairty?&quot;

&quot;Its for an orphanage downtown. I odn&#39;t know the name of it.&quot; Makoto 
glanced over her reading glasses, reading the music an playing it at 
the same time.

Minako stood up from her seat and leaned on the end of the piano, 
placing her head in her hands. She looked at Makoto quizically.

&quot;When did you start wearing glasses, Mako-chan?&quot;

&quot;About...two years ago. I think. Maybe three.&quot;

Minako nodded. She looked at Makoto more, studing her features. 
Makoto;s face was bent down, reading music and playing the keys of the 
piano expertly. Nothing seemed to have changed over the past five 
years. Except maybe her personality. Minako had never seen Makoto so 
harsh and yet gentle at the same time. And when had she learned to 
play the piano? Minako knew Maktoo could play the guitar, but no the 
piano. Maybe being able to read notes was all that mattered.

&quot;Take a picture it will last longer,&quot; Makoto said, glancing up at 
Minako&#39;s blushing face and smiling before looking back down. Minako 
blinked and sweatdropped.

&quot;Gomen ne, I didn&#39;t mean to stare.&quot;

&quot;Its alright,&quot; Makoto said, placing the sheet music into a folder and 
closing the piano lid over the keys. She streched and yawned. &quot;Its 
late Minako. I&#39;m going home. Would you like a ride to your apartment?&quot;

&quot;Iie. I think I&#39;ll walk home,&quot; Minako said walking back over to the 
window seat and getting her jacket.

&quot;Minako,&quot; Makoto said, raising one eyebrow. &quot;Its almost two in the 
morning. Plus its freezing. You&#39;re not going to walk home.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m a big girl,&quot; Minako said. &quot;I can take care of myself.&quot;

&quot;Makoto looked at her.&quot; Riiiiight....I&#39;m tking you home. And not 
another word,&quot; she snapped when she saw Minako opening her mouth to 
protest.

&quot;Ok ok ok. Sheesh.&quot; Minako put her jacket o and followed Maktoo out of 
the studio and out of the temple. They walked down the stairs and down 
the street a ways, where Makoto was parked. They climed into the car 
after Makoto had unlocked it and they were soon on their way to 
Minako&#39;s apartment.

They were silent the entire ride. Makoto had her radio on, but it was 
turned down very low. But in such a thick silence, it sounded like it 
was loud enough to burst eardrums.

But maybe that was the silence itself, Minako thought. She leaned back 
into her seat as Maktoo drove. Makoto never once looked at her the 
entire trip. Minako was starting to think maybe she was mad she had to 
bring her home.

Minako chanced a look at Makoto. Her face was like stone, un moving. 
But, her eyes seemed to be flashing. Not with anger...Minako thought 
long and hard about it. That was always the look Makoto had on her 
face when she was thinking about something.

Minako nodded to herself. She had known Makoto long enough to never 
ask her what was on her mind. She would never say.

Minako felt the car stop, but didn&#39;t look up. 

&quot;You&#39;re home,&quot; Makoto said.

That time Minako did look up. &quot;Oh. I thought we were at another stop 
light.&quot;

&quot;Nope. You&#39;re home,&quot; Makoto said. &quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind that I don&#39;t 
ffer to walk you in. I have that concert tomoorw evening, and I need 
some rest.&quot;

&quot;Oh no problem,&quot; Minako said, climing out of the jeep. Turning around 
quicklly, Minako said,&#39; Uh, Mako-chan?&quot;

Makoto looked at Minako. &quot;Hai?&quot;

&quot;Uh...Goodnight.&quot;

&quot;G&#39;night.&quot;

Minako closed the jeep door and watched Makoto pull off into the 
night. She sighed and slowly walked into her apartment building alone.

------------------------------------------------------------

It had been three hours chuck full of different types of music. The 
concert had been a sucess. The orphange now had more than enough money 
to expand for more children to stay.

Minako and the other girls waited for the last band to play, which was 
Yuuchirou&#39;s group. they had named themselves Cherry Hill, but no one 
was quite sure how they came up with that name.

The stage was dark, but if you looked hard enough you could see people 
moving about on the stage, setting up interments.

Soon there was quiet as a piano began to play and the song began...

It starts with one

One thing I don&#39;t know why 
It doesn&#39;t even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme 
To explain in due time
All I know 
Time is a valuable thing 
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings 
Watch it count down to the end of the day 
The clock ticks life 
It&#39;s so unreal 
Didn&#39;t look out below 
Watch the time go right out the window 
Trying to hold on but didn&#39;t even know 
Wasted it all just to 
Watch you go 
I kept everything inside and even though 
I tried it all fell apart 
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried 
So hard 
And got SO far 
But it the end 
It doesn&#39;t even matter 
I had to fall 
TO lose it all 
But in the End 
It Doesn&#39;t even Matter

One thing I don&#39;t know why 
Doesn&#39;t even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme 
To explain in due time 
I tried so hard 
In spite of the way you were mocking me 
Acting like I was part of your property 
Remembering all the times you fought with me 
I&#39;m surprised it got so (far) 
Things aren&#39;t the way they were before 
You wouldn&#39;t even recognize me anymore 
Not that you knew me back then 
But it all comes back to me 
In the end 
You kept everything inside and even though I tried it all fell apart 
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried 
So hard 
And got SO far 
But it the end 
It doesn&#39;t even matter 
I had to fall 
TO lose it all 
But in the End 
It Doesn&#39;t even Matter

I put my trust in you 
Pushed as far as I can go 
And for all this 
There&#39;s only one thing you should know

I put my trust in you 
Pushed as far as I can go 
And for all this 
There&#39;s only one thing you should know

I tried 
So hard 
And got SO far 
But it the end 
It doesn&#39;t even matter 
I had to fall 
TO lose it all 
But in the End 
It Doesn&#39;t even Matter

------------------------------------------------------------

Everyone claped and cheered. The song, although some what depressing 
and different from the rest of the songs heard that night, had gotten 
a bigger response. Maybe it was because it was the last song and 
everyone wanted to go home, Minako thought.

After about 20 minutes, the band mates met everyone out in the crisp 
October air. Makoto and the drumer were the only two not carrying 
anything. 

The members of the band said goodbye to Yuuchirou and the girls befor 
heading off to their own cars, wanting to go home just as badly as the 
audiance had. Yuuchirou also drove alone. The girls wanted to walk 
back to the temple.

As they walked, Makoto and Mnako fell back towards the end of the 
little group. They were a few feet behind the other three girls, 
talking to one another. Rei glanced over her shoulder and smiled when 
she saw Makoto give Minako her jacket.

As they walked past the park, the girls heard screams coming from it. 
The Senshi looked and nodded at each other.

&quot;Makoto, go straight to the temple and wait for us, alright,&quot; Mianko 
said. Makoto nodded and ran for the temple. Minako had this feeling 
she would show up during the fight, but ignored it.

They transformed and ran into the park, listening for more screams to 
guide them.

When they reached where the youma was, they saw no people who could 
have screamed. They looked at the youma, who smiled wickedly and 
opened it&#39;s mouth, a human scream coming from it.

&quot;Its a trap,&quot; Mars said to herself. The others heard her and nodded, 
thinking of doubleing back to think of a plan. But as they were about 
to turn and run, Kunzite appeared before them.

&quot;I want that crystal, and I want it now!&quot; He demended of the senshi. 

The youma was closing in on them from the back, its shadow like body 
blending in with the surrounding darkness. Its eyes glowed red. Aand 
even in the dark the senshi could tell it was smirking at them.

&quot;What do we do,&quot; Venus asked.

&quot;Trash them both,&quot; Sailor Moon said.

&quot;Iie, if we do that, we may never see Mamoru again,&quot; Mars said.

&quot;Then lets trash the monster and get out of here,&quot; venus said. 
&quot;Mercury, scan?&quot;

&quot;Its weak to lightining,&quot; Mercury said, putting her scanner away. 

&quot;Lightening,&quot; Mars said. &quot;None of us has that type of power!&quot;

&quot;Hai, I know. Probably why Kunzite is using it,&quot; Mercury replied.

&quot;I say we stun it and get the hell out of here, if we can&#39;t beat that 
thing,&quot; Moon said, looking scarred.

&quot;You&#39;re not going anywhere!&quot; The four Senshi looked up at Kunzite.

&quot;Isay we go with Sailor Moon&#39;s plan,&quot; Venus whispered to Mars who 
nodded in agreement.

&quot;...Jupiter...&quot;

Evryone looked up at the new voice, trying to find out where it was 
coing from.

&quot;...Thunder...&quot;

Kunzite&#39;s eyes darted everywhere, lookking for the person speaking.

&quot;CRASH!&quot;

Everyone&#39;s heads turned toward the creature, who was screaming in 
pain, its dark body was lighted up as sparks of electricty jumped 
around its body.

&quot;What the-?&quot; Kunzite didn&#39;t finsh his sentence. He was attacked by a 
large animal that landed next to him when he fell to the ground. The 
animal was hidden in the shadows, but the senshi thought it looked 
like a cat of some sort.

Kunzite stood and when he did, he was pounced once again, the animal 
coming into veiw. It was a dark colored tiger. The senshi weren&#39;t sure 
of the color because of the darkness, but they could make out the 
stripes and white fur markings.

&quot;Whats up with the tiger warriors,&quot; Sailor Mars demanded.

The girls heard a roaring noise behind them and dodged just as the 
shadow creature was about to strike them down.

As it ran past them, it halted and turned around, ready to try and ram 
them again. Just as it was about to run, a figure jumped from out of 
the trees and rammed into it, knocking it over onto its side.

The stranger performed another one of her thunder attacks before 
screaming,&quot;Sailor Moon! Use your sceptor!&quot;

Sailor Moon nodded and healed the youma, who turned out to be a person 
from the electric compeny.

Kunzite blew the large cat off of him while everyone was distracted 
with the youma. The cat growled feircley and pounced at him, but he 
was too high up for the cat to reach.

Kunzite, his clothes and hair dishelved from the attack, just sneered 
at the senshi and the newcomers before disappearing without a word.

The senshi looked at the ones who saved them closely. The human was 
defenitly a girl. They could tell that just by the voice. But her 
features were still hidden by the shadows, so they couldn&#39;t make those 
out.

Before the Senshi could ask questions, the girl and the tiger ran off 
in the opposite direction, quickly passing under a street light. They 
gasped when they say the girl was wearing the same fukus as them, 
except in green. The tiger was a dark, midnight blue.

The senshi chatted among themselves, while a set of eyes watched in 
the bushes. One pair red, the other blue. They nodded toward eachother 
before running off themselves.
