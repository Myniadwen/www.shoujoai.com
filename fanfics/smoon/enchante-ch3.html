<h1>Enchante (part 3 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/enchante-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>The doorbell rang. This was an unusual occurrence. Few people knew 
where we lived, and of them, few visited. We went out of our way to 
remain anonymous, to be honest. Neither of us had a desire to have 
what is amusingly referred to as a &quot;social life.&quot; Michiru and I are 
both private people, by nature and by circumstance.

I looked into the peephole and let a grin cross my face. I turned and 
called over my shoulder. &quot;It&#39;s for you.&quot; Michiru walked across the 
tatami and joined me at the door. She looked quizzically at me, then 
looked through the peephole. The doorbell rang again and Michiru 
shifted back, color showing in her cheeks.

Michiru turned without a word and went into the kitchen to make tea. I 
stood back from the door, turned to the window and looked out, so my 
smile would not show, and called out. &quot;Come in!&quot;

The door opened slowly and a figure entered, bowing deeply.

I turned and greeted Ami with a welcoming gesture. She bowed again, 
holding out a decorated box. I thanked her for the gift and asked her 
to make herself comfortable. She blushed deeply and thanked me, as 
politely as possible. I watched her as she looked around, noticing 
Michiru&#146;s paintings on the walls, taking in the sparse furnishings, 
the antique lacquered cabinet. I felt bad for her, to be honest. I 
promised myself I would not tease her, she was too sensitive by half. 
So polite and overwrought. She had no idea how guilty Michiru felt 
when it came to her, how they had met and raced, and how Michiru had 
hurt her feelings. Michiru still beat herself up about the way she had 
treated Ami. When I teased Michiru at that tea shop, I had no idea the 
girl would truly find the will to come here and have it out with her. 
There was a lot I did not yet know about Mizuno Ami.

Michiru entered and Ami protested that she had gone to too much 
trouble. I opened the box as Michiru set out tea cups and pot. Inside 
were exceptionally decorated mochi and bean sweets. I was impressed. 
Its very hard to find this level of skill, and expensive too. We 
exclaimed over the gift, pronouncing polite thanks and Ami replied 
saying that we were too kind. 

I had a hard time not laughing at the farce. As soon as it was polite 
to do so, I excused myself, claiming I had business elsewhere. Michiru 
shot me a look, but said nothing. I left, intending to go for a long, 
long car ride.

***********

I returned several hours later, tired from the road, and the fresh 
air, and the sea. There was sand in between my toes and in my hair, 
but I felt great. I entered the apartment, listened for a moment but 
heard nothing. Shrugging, I assumed Ami was gone, along with Michiru. 
I stripped down in the bathroom, rinsed myself off and gave myself a 
long soak in the tub. One of my guilty pleasures, I&#146;ll admit. I became 
addicted to bathing when I was running regularly. Although I was a 
sprinter, we trained for long hours at a time. A hot bath was magic 
then.

I was just contemplating leaving my refuge, when the bathroom door 
slid open. Michiru entered, wearing the yukata I gave her for her last 
birthday. It is a silk brocade, beginning at the color in the exact 
shade of her hair, and graduating  to a pale cream at the bottom. The 
brocade pattern is small, finely sewn waves, each the same color as 
the material behind it. It is a magnificent robe, and she looks every 
inch a Princess in it.

She smiled and held out a towel as I rose. Her hair was up, and she 
looked slightly bedraggled, as if she had just awakened. I smiled back 
at her and took the towel, wrapping myself in it. I stepped up to her 
and kissed her lightly on the lips. She put her finger on my lips, 
took one hand and led me out of the bathroom.

When she got to the bedroom door, she stopped me and asked me to wait 
a moment. I did as she asked and she stepped into the room, sliding 
the door behind her. I heard some movement, then silence. Michiru&#146;s 
voice came through the door, asking me to enter.

When I stepped into the room I was greeted with a surprising, but 
pleasant picture. Michiru was sitting on the bed, her robe gathered 
around her in waves of bluegreen and cream. Her legs were neatly 
tucked underneath her and her hair was loose once again. And sitting 
next to her, surrounded by billowing folds of golden silk, sat Ami. I 
laughed to see her, dwarfed in my golden yuakata, the material 
practically drowning her limbs. She smiled tentatively up at me and I 
smiled reassuringly back at her.

Michiru reached over and pulled at one of the robe&#146;s shoulders. Ami&#146;s 
pale freckled skin showed. Michiru stroked the shoulder lovingly, 
inviting me to touch it. I came over to the bed, leaned over the girl 
and placed a kiss right in the hollow between neck and shoulder. Ami 
smiled at me, no longer tentative and pulled my face into her body. 
She fell back in folds of golden silk, her hair falling into her eyes. 
I covered her body with my own and held her close while she reached 
for me and kissed me. I could feel Michiru stripping the towel from my 
body, as I pulled Ami free of my robe. Her breasts were small, firm 
and incredibly hard. I really think I could never get tired of playing 
with them. Her aureoles were large, coral and delicious. I held them 
together licking both nipples alternately, or pinching them in between 
my fingers until she cried out.

What I truly wanted to do was fuck this girl. I looked inter her eyes 
and I could see her crying out for it. She wanted me to be in her and 
I wanted to oblige. I wanted to play this girl the way Michiru strokes 
her violin - lovingly, firmly, sensuously.

I always joke that Michiru can read my mind. I&#146;m not sure its not the 
truth. I could feel her moving around on the bed, lifting one of my 
legs, then fastening something to it. I smiled. This is our new toy. 
It is not uncomfortable to wear, nor is it uncomfortable to find 
inside yourself. If it has a name, I don&#146;t know it, I don&#146;t care, 
really. I repositioned myself slightly, moving my leg against Ami, 
finding her already wet and ready. I lifted my thigh and thrust it 
towards her slowly, moving the dildo slowly into her. Her mouth was 
slack, eyes closed and nothing coherent was coming out of her mouth, 
just soft moans that spoke volumes.

I moved in and out slowly, wanting Ami to meet me, join me in this. 
First her hips joined me, moving almost despite her will. Then her 
hands found me and pulled me to her, crushing my face to her breast, 
grabbing onto my hair and pulling me in. I moved my leg back and 
forth, finding all the corners inside her, missing only one thing. I 
had no idea where Michiru might be. I thought how lovely it would be 
if she would kiss Ami for me, soothe the girl&#146;s heat with cooling 
caresses.

Ami&#146;s thrusts were speeding up now, but I didn&#146;t want it to be over so 
soon, so I slowed again, making her growl low in her throat. I 
laughed, then used my teeth on that throat. Slowly, slowly I kept the 
tempo tantalizing, maddeningly slow and Ami was beginning to become 
desperate. I was just about to slam myself into Ami when I felt my own 
cunt filled in one smooth motion with another object. Michiru was 
kneeling behind me, her own toy strapped on and an truly evil smile on 
her face. I gasped as she entered me, forcing my leg forward into Ami, 
who rose off the bed. Ami sat up, pulling me into her neck and looked 
over my shoulder at Michiru. That set her off. Ami let herself go 
completely, begging me to go in her, pulling me in with every thrust. 
I could feel her vibrating now, thrumming underneath me and I knew she 
was going to come. Michiru reached beneath me and began to play with 
my clit, massaging me inside and out. A noise from deep inside me 
began to build and I didn&#146;t bother trying to stop it. As Ami&#146;s body 
tensed underneath me, whipping back and forth in ecstasy, my own 
orgasm was hard, deep and internal. I could hear Michiru grunting 
softly behind me and Ami wailing beneath me and I let myself be 
carried away by the intensity between us. Ami came first, her body 
tensing and releasing for what seemed like an hour. I followed next, 
when Michiru pounded into me one last time and I collapsed heavily 
onto Ami, who lay completely spent, on the bed. Michiru followed, as 
soon as my orgasm began, fingering herself to climax, so that I could 
hear her as I enjoyed my own.

 

I rolled off of Ami, who looked to be asleep amongst her sea of golden 
silk and rolled towards Michiru, now completely naked. I looked into 
her eyes and kissed her hard. She laid her head against my chest and I 
leaned back. I could feel Ami snuggle herself into my body and I fell 
asleep.

Ami woke a short time later and looked around the unfamiliar 
surroundings. I saw her blush as she looked at us, then quickly gather 
up the robe and cover herself. The last thing I wanted was for this 
gentle, beautiful creature to go running off, regretting any moment of 
this, so I put a hand out to stop her.

&quot;Please don&#146;t go.&quot; I said quietly. Her eyes fell, but her smile was 
not at all embarrassed. I sighed, relieved.

&quot;I thought I might be able to use your bath....&quot; I gave her permission 
with a nod and a smile.

Ami bathed, then dressed. When I saw her again she was gathering her 
things to go. I was standing in the living room, looking out the 
window at the stars. Ami entered with Michiru, holding a small 
package.

I turned and held my hand out to Ami, who gripped it with surprising 
firmness, bowed and thanked me. She left then and a profound silence 
fell on the apartment, as if someone had turned off music that had 
been playing. 

I turned back to the window and Michiru stood next to me, her hand on 
my arm. we stood for a moment in silence.

&quot;What did you give her?&quot; I asked, thinking of the package the girl 
held as she left.

&quot;A copy of Mozart&#146;s No. 4 Violin Concerto in D major. The one I 
recorded at the Acropolis.&quot; she smiled and put her head on my arm.

&quot;Exactly.&quot; I said, and put my arm around her.</pre>
