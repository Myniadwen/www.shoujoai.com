<h1>It's Another Tequila Sunrise</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/loki.html">LokiLeysmith</a><br> </h2>
<pre>AN: This is just a mad, whimsical little story that has been rattling 
through my mind for a bit. Rating is for some mild profanity and sexual 
innuendo. 

Character ages: 

Haruka &amp; Michiru: 27

Setsuna: appears to be in her early-mid 20&#39;s. Actual age: unknown.

Usagi, Rei, Ami, Minako, &amp; Makoto: 25

Hotaru: 18

Mamoru: 28

 
&quot;GAAHH! Someone turn off the light!&quot; I moaned in my sleep as the bright 
light burned through my closed eyes. Of course no one turned off the 
damn light, so I had to do it myself. Typical. My head started pounding 
a bit.

Opening my eyes slowly, I looked into the offending light and noticed 
that it was the morning sun, and thus impossible to turn off. I groaned, 
closed my eyes again, and attempted to gather my fuzzy thoughts.

First, where was I? In a bed of course, but was it mine? Opening my one 
eye slowly, I took a quick look around from where I was lying. It was my 
room from what I could see. I breathed a sigh of relief and closed my 
eye again. 

Second, who was I? Taking a second or two to think, I remembered that my 
name was Setsuna Meioh. This was a good sign. I remembered my own name, 
and I was in my own bed. Good, good. 

Third, and most importantly to me at this moment, what the bloody hell 
had I been doing last night? 

I vaguely recalled something about going to someone else&#39;s home for some 
obscure reason. Whose home? What reason? Oh right, I remember. It was 
Minako&#39;s home, and her 25th birthday party. Great, but this didn&#39;t 
explain everything. Like why does my brain feel like it&#39;s made of 
oatmeal for instance? 

Lying there in my bed, I struggled to recall last night&#39;s events. 
Haruka, Michiru, Hotaru and I went to Minako&#39;s home for her party. We 
had the usual great food that Makoto made, along with a few drinks. Just 
light stuff, a glass of wine or two, nothing more. 

Makoto, I recalled at this point, handed me a rum and Coke. Ok, fine no 
biggie. I&#39;d had a good dinner, one of these shouldn&#39;t affect me this 
badly. Five or six shouldn&#39;t affect me this badly, so what the hell was 
it. 

Chancing another look into the glare, I raised my head up and chanced a 
look at my alarm clock/radio where I saw two things that made my 
headache a hundred times worse. The first was the time, 1035 AM. The 
second was a nearly empty bottle of tequila. I moaned and slumped back 
onto the pillow.

Tequila. It had to be tequila. To me, tequila was like kryptonite is to 
Superman, specifically red kryptonite, which has all sorts of strange 
and unpredictable effects on him. In my case though, I know exactly from 
long and bitter experience what effect tequila has on me. Basically it 
turns calm, mature, responsible Setsuna into Sexy Setsie, one-woman 
sorority party.

Why me, Lord? Why me? 

Haruka. Of course it was Haruka. She knew damn well what affect that 
vile substance had on me, and she made sure that I had some at every 
party we went to. And she and Michiru wonder why I am reluctant to go to 
parties. 

They had found out what affect tequila had on me a few years ago when we 
went out to celebrate the anniversary of the three of us moving in 
together. It had been a difficult time for us at that point, and we were 
looking for any excuse to go out and celebrate so we could unwind. We 
left Hotaru with Makoto and went out to a popular nightclub that Minako 
recommended.      

It was a loud and busy place, and there was a long line-up to get in. 
Fortunately or unfortunately we had VIP passes that Minako had acquired 
somehow, and Haruka&#39;s fame as a racecar driver helped as well, so we got 
in quickly. 

The place was crowded with dozens of men and women, most of whom were in 
our, well Michiru and Haruka&#39;s, age range. We managed to get a table and 
order a few drinks. I was content with a rum and Coke, and Michiru had 
the same. Haruka, ever the wild child, ordered some strange concoction 
that appeared to be glowing. She insisted on the two of us trying it, 
and Michiru was hooked instantly while I passed. Undaunted, Haruka 
ordered a round of tequila shooters. I tried not to drink more than one 
or two, but like the potato chips, I can&#39;t have just one, and so one 
drink led to the inevitable tray, and then the party started. 

Haruka filled in the details, in all their gory detail. After several 
shooters I was basically flying, and Haruka, naturally, was enjoying 
every minute of it. Michiru was supposed to be the voice of reason, but 
after a few shooters, a few rum and cokes, and two of the strange 
glowing things, she was pretty much wasted. Meanwhile I was leading 
everyone in the bar in one big Conga line. Or was it the bunny hop? 
Haruka wasn&#39;t even sure at this point. Then she mentioned that I did a 
strip tease down to my bra and panties, whereupon I gave a 
semi-conscious Michiru a lap dance to the appreciation of everyone in 
the bar. She told me I finally passed out after doing some odd dance on 
the bar top then passed out. We were taken home by taxi, where I slept 
until the following afternoon and spent most of the rest of the day in 
communion with the toilet. 

Ever since then, despite Michiru&#39;s pleading, and dire threats of fates 
worse than death from me, almost every birthday party or new years 
party, or whatever, Haruka usually hands me a tequila and sits back to 
watch the fun, and of course she brings a video camera. 

When my head stops pounding, I am going to kill her. No ifs, ands, or 
buts about it. Haruka Tenoh was a dead woman walking. I let these 
thoughts comfort me as I lay there. Then I remembered the downside to my 
plans. Michiru wasn&#39;t responsible, as she was the one who usually tries 
to stop her lover from doing this to me. But if I tried to kill Haruka, 
I would have to kill her as well, and I wasn&#39;t about to do that to her, 
I cared too much for her. Besides I didn&#39;t want to leave her and Hotaru 
alone with Haruka.

Ah yes, Hotaru, our beautiful little princess. She just turned 18 this 
year and had started at Tokyo University. I loved her too much to 
justify murdering her &#39;papa&#39; even if she deserved it. 

I hate having a conscience it can be such a bother sometimes. 

On the upside, I wasn&#39;t feeling ill like I did every time I had drunk 
the crap. This time I had a really good dinner before hand. I would have 
to call Makoto later and thank her for that at least. Now would be as 
good a time as any to get out of bed and have a shower I suppose. I 
stretched a bit as I prepared to toss the covers aside and head for the 
shower, and promptly froze as my foot brushed against something, 
something warm and soft.

No. No, no, no, no. This is not happening. I am Sailor Pluto, the 
Guardian of Time. I do not get shit faced and wake up in the morning 
with strange people in my bed. Okay maybe I do on occasion, but the last 
time was in 1926. Or was it 1945? God damn it! 

Then I realized, after turning over slowly and sitting up, that I was 
naked. Great. Just perfect. I was hung over, naked, and I had a strange 
person in my bed. Okay, maybe I wouldn&#39;t kill Haruka. I&#39;ll just maim her 
a bit. Michiru and Hotaru would accept that, wouldn&#39;t they?

The urge to panic and run started to rise, and I fought it down to the 
best of my abilities. The figure was completely covered in my blankets, 
like a butterfly in its cocoon, so I couldn&#39;t tell what gender the 
person was, much less who. 

As I sat there, my mind raced with the possibilities. Haruka or Michiru? 
It was possible, and not entirely out of the question. I won&#39;t deny that 
I have had a few dreams to that effect ever since I moved in with them, 
although I have never told them about them. I had thought of a variety 
of reactions from them if I told them about my dreams regarding them, 
and I narrowed the list down to the three strongest possibilities.

A) They just laugh and tell me I&#39;m being silly.
B) They get angry and kick me out.
C) They grab me, take me to their bedroom, cover me in chocolate sauce, 
or whatever, and ravish me until I&#39;m unconscious. Then they wake me and 
repeat the process. 

So I am rather reluctant to discuss my dreams with them.

Who else? Minako? Well she is extraordinarily beautiful. Long blonde 
hair, blue eyes, gymnasts&#39; body, warm bubbly personality, etc. I doubt 
that any man, or woman for that matter, could resist her charms for 
long, drunk or otherwise. 

Makoto? Okay, she&#39;s tall, muscular, graceful, and has large firm 
breasts, and she&#39;s one hell of a cook to boot. Again, someone difficult 
to resist, provided you liked being with someone who, in all likelihood, 
could bench press you over her head. Then again some people would find 
that a turn on. 

Usagi? That thought made me nervous. Sure she&#39;s the sweetest, most 
loving person that I have ever known, and lovely to look at, but she is 
my future queen. And her Mom would kill me. Both of them.

The figure beside me stirred and groaned a bit. I felt the panic in me 
rise as the blankets shifted a bit, and parted to reveal the top of 
someone&#39;s head, a head with dark hair on it. The figure groaned again, 
but stayed asleep. I began to breathe normally again.

Dark hair? That narrowed the possibilities to a few people. 

Rei? She was a very stunning woman with long raven tresses and a body 
honed to perfection by years of martial arts training and other athletic 
pursuits. Of course there was her legendary temper to consider, but the 
pros far outweighed the cons.

Ami? She was quite attractive despite what the shy bookworm thought 
about herself. Blue tinted black hair, ice blue eyes that radiated 
warmth and intelligence, a swimmers graceful body, and she looked so 
damn cute when she blushed. 

Mamoru? Tall, muscular, piercing blue eyes, practically every woman&#39;s 
dream come true. Although in this case, he was her future queen&#39;s dream 
come true, and I was loath to jeopardize that for the sake of a cheap 
fling.

One more possibility occurred to me, and it scared me to death. Hotaru. 
My daughter. Yes she was beautiful with her dark hair and large purple 
eyes, pale skin and whatnot, but she was still my daughter. She had been 
out on a few dates during her high school years, and in fact she has 
been dating her current beau for over 5 months now, despite Haruka&#39;s 
best efforts to scare him off at the beginning. Hell, Haruka and the boy 
get along so well now, its&#39; almost frightening. But the possibility of 
me sleeping with my own daughter revolted me to the core of my being, 
even if she is adopted.

But, upon closer examination, the figure in the bed beside me was too 
tall to be Hotaru, so I breathed a sigh of relief. 

The figure was sleeping soundly, so I decided to sneak out of bed and go 
have a shower. I thought I would deal with the problem of the sleeping 
figure better if I were wide-awake and dressed. Hopefully I could even 
go downstairs and get a cup of coffee for him or her and discuss things 
rationally before anyone found out, especially Haruka. With that in 
mind, I slid out of bed and padded naked to where my bathrobe was. Which 
is, of course when my alarm went off. Actually it was the radio, at full 
volume. Naturally the radio was playing a very appropriate song to suit 
the occasion. 

It&#39;s another tequila sunrise
Stirring slowly across the sky
Said goodbye
He was just a hired hand
Working on the dreams he planned to try
The days go by.

Desperately stabbing at the buttons to turn the noise off, I finally 
reached down and tore the cord out of the wall. I hated that song now. I 
hated all of their songs now. I hated the Eagles now. I resolved that as 
soon as I dealt with this situation, I would find where each member of 
the Eagles was and kill them all, slowly and painfully. Starting with 
Glenn Frey. His death would be whispered about in the centuries to come. 
His death would...

As I pondered the murder of my now least favorite band, the figure in my 
bed abruptly sat upright. The blankets fell away to reveal Rei Hino&#39;s 
long dark tresses, and more importantly, her naked body. Very awake now, 
she started looking around the room desperately until she focused on me, 
not to mention my very naked body. We both screamed. So much for no one 
else finding out. 

&quot;Set-Set-Setsuna?&quot; Rei stammered out. Her eyes widened in fear and 
surprise as she stared at me. I yelped and quickly donned my robe while 
she covered herself.

&quot;Umm, good morning Rei.&quot; I replied as politely as I could manage despite 
being scared to death. 

Someone started pounding on my door. &quot;Setsuna?&quot; It was Michiru. &quot;Are you 
all right?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; I lied.

&quot;Are you sure? You screamed like you just saw a bunch of cockroaches.&quot; 
Hotaru said.

&quot;Yeah that was it. I killed it and tossed it out the window. 
Everything&#39;s fine now. Go back to sleep.&quot; I lied again. Cockroaches. 
Maybe I could pull this off.

&quot;Is there someone else in there? I swore I could hear two screams.&quot; 
Haruka demanded.

&quot;That was the radio. I&#39;m fine. There&#39;s no one else in here. Really.&quot; I 
swore my nose must be 8 feet long now what with the whoppers I was 
telling, but they seemed to be buying it. In my bed Rei sat there 
trembling with her hand over her mouth. 

&quot;If you say so Setsuna. Well, since we&#39;re up, I&#39;ll start breakfast. See 
you downstairs.&quot; Michiru said. I heard them all go back to their rooms 
to get ready. That gave Rei and I a chance to talk. 

&quot;So.&quot; Rei said as she got up and looked for her clothes. They were on 
the floor next to her side of the bed. I then noticed that the dress I 
had been wearing last night was on the floor by my feet. I picked it up 
and frowned, a trip to the dry cleaners was on the agenda for today.

&quot;So, umm, how are you, Rei?&quot; I asked.

&quot;Fine. You?&quot; 

&quot;Fine.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s good.&quot; She began to get dressed again. I turned away to give her 
a bit of privacy. 

&quot;Okay you can look again.&quot; I turned back and she was wearing the same 
outfit she wore last night, a red jacket, white blouse, and skin tight 
black leather pants that showed off her figure quite well. I turned away 
again, feeling the heat rise in my cheeks. I swore to never again drink 
tequila as long as I lived.

&quot;How much of last night do you remember?&quot; I asked, still looking away.

&quot;Well, I remember a wonderful dinner, followed by all of us sitting 
around having a few drinks and talking. Then Usagi put on some music and 
she and Mamoru started dancing. The rest of us joined in, Ami with 
Makoto, Minako with Hotaru, Haruka with Michiru...&quot; 

&quot;And you with me.&quot; I finished, looking down at the floor. 

&quot;Yeah. Then we had a few more drinks and changed partners. Then the hard 
liquor came out and that&#39;s when Michiru took Hotaru home.&quot; Rei said. 
Thank goodness, Hotaru was at least spared me making a complete ass of 
myself.

&quot;Then what happened?&quot; I asked, fearing the worst.

&quot;Well, we started hitting the hard stuff really hard. Minako got totally 
smashed on Jack Daniels, while Usagi had two glasses of Vodka and passed 
out on the couch. She never could hold her booze.&quot; Rei giggled and I 
laughed along with her.

&quot;Then what?&quot; 

&quot;Michiru came back at the same time you started hitting the tequila like 
there was no tomorrow.&quot; Rei stated. I knew it. 

&quot;And then?&quot; My heart began to beat faster.

&quot;You started dancing with everyone, and singing a rap version of 
&#39;Moonlight Densetsu&#39;...&quot; Rei began. I cut her off.

&quot;A rap version of &#39;Moonlight Densetsu&#39;?&quot; I couldn&#39;t imagine such a thing 
in a million years. 

&quot;Yeah, it was...interesting to say the least.&quot; Rei said, then she 
grinned evilly. &quot;But not as interesting as the lap dance you gave to 
Usagi.&quot; 

I felt myself grow weak at the knees. 
&quot;I...gave...a...lap...dance...to...Usagi?&quot; This was not happening I told 
myself.

&quot;Ohh yeah. Too bad she was unconscious, I&#39;m sure she would have enjoyed 
it. I know the rest of us did. And Haruka got it all on tape!&quot; Rei was 
cackling like mad now. Haruka had it on tape. Of course she did. 

&quot;And then?&quot; I braced myself for the next blow.   

&quot;After that things get a bit hazy. I remember you and I dirty dancing 
together, then I had a few more drinks, then nothing until we woke up.&quot; 
Rei finished.

&quot;Wonderful.&quot; I wanted to die, right then and there. I was feeling so 
humiliated by this point. The thought of going to the Time Gate and 
erasing last night was starting to look good right now. Then Rei came up 
and placed her hand on my shoulder. 

&quot;Look at me Setsuna, please.&quot; She said softly. I meekly complied and 
looked at her smiling face.

&quot;I know you feel like hell right now, but I just want you to know, I 
don&#39;t regret what happened.&quot; She paused, grimaced, and rubbed her 
temples a bit. &quot;Well maybe the drinking part. My point is, I&#39;m still 
your friend, and I don&#39;t want something like this to come between our 
friendship. I care about you and I don&#39;t want to see you hurt, and I 
know you don&#39;t want to hurt me.&quot; Rei placed her other hand on my 
shoulder and smiled even more at me. Finally I smiled back and wrapped 
my arms around her. 

&quot;I would never hurt you Rei. I do value our friendship, very much. And I 
don&#39;t regret what happened either.&quot; I stated. We stared at each other 
for a few moments then we moved closer together and kissed each other on 
the lips, a deep passionate kiss.

We stayed like that for what seemed like several minutes until we broke 
apart, each with a contented sigh. 

&quot;I should be getting home now.&quot; Rei murmured softly as she placed her 
head on my shoulder. 

&quot;Give me a moment to change and I&#39;ll take you through a portal to your 
home.&quot; I replied, kissing her on the cheek. 

&quot;Okay.&quot; Rei replied softly. We broke the embrace so I could transform 
and open a portal. We stepped through and soon we were at her home. 

&quot;Call me later?&quot; Rei asked as I stepped up to the portal to go back 
home.

&quot;I will. Farewell Rei.&quot; I replied. She kissed me on the cheek. I smiled, 
waved, and stepped back through the portal and back home. I changed back 
to my normal self, showered, dressed, and went downstairs to join my 
family for breakfast. After that though, I needed to do something to 
payback Haruka. I wondered if we had some Natto handy...

The End.</pre>
