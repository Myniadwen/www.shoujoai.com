<h1>Senshi: the Gathering of Five (part 1 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a>

<pre>        She should have looked utterly ridiculous to Rei Hino, the 
blonde haired girl walking up the shrine steps towards her. The school 
uniform looked fine, but her hair was oddly styled, tied up on her 
head into two balls and leaving two streamers of hair flowing 
backward.. The strangest thing was what she carried on her back, what 
looked like a wooden practice sword.

        Rei&#39;s eyes widened as she grew nearer, and the girl with the 
long black hair realized that it was a real katana that she carried!

        &quot;Rei Hino?&quot; the blonde asked her softly.

        &quot;Yes?&quot; Rei asked her cautiously.

        The blonde smiled wryly at her tone. &quot;My name is Usagi 
Tsukino,&quot; she bowed slightly, &quot;and I need your help.&quot;

        Rei bowed back, more from instinct than anything else. Quite 
carefully she asked, &quot;And what can I do to help you, Tsukino-san?&quot;

        &quot;Usagi,&quot; she corrected her gently. &quot;I need someone with your 
special talents,&quot; Usagi explained, &quot;I need a miko.&quot;

        Rei gaped at her silently, then she shook her head angrily. &quot;I 
don&#39;t know who you&#39;ve been talking to,&quot; she said angrily, &quot;but...&quot;

        Usagi&#39;s head came up suddenly, as if something had gotten her 
attention. Just visible over her shoulder the hilt of the sword began 
to glow softly, a soft golden light. She grasped the hilt and drew the 
sword smoothly, the light shining brighter.

        &quot;What... what in the,&quot; Rei stammered, stepping backwards.

        &quot;where are you?&quot; Usagi muttered, turning about. As she moved 
the sword glowed brighter, shining the most when pointed towards the 
shrine buildings themselves. &quot;Come out,&quot; she cried out, &quot;I know you&#39;re 
in there!&quot;

        The door smoothly slid open and a slim, blonde haired man 
stepped outside, dressed in a gray jacket and matching pants. He could 
be handsome, almost, if you chose to ignore the coldness that was 
clearly evident in his blue eyes.

        &quot;Jad,&quot; Rei blinked at him in surprise. She hadn&#39;t expected to 
see the assistant her father had hired to work at the shrine standing 
there so calmly.

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry Miss Rei,&quot; the blonde haired man tipped his head to 
her respectfully, &quot;but that&#39;s not my real name. I&#39;m Jadite.&quot; He looked 
at Usagi, a slight smile pulling at his lips as he said, &quot;I didn&#39;t 
expect you to find me so soon, Princess.&quot;

        &quot;Don&#39;t call me that,&quot; Usagi said softly.

        Jadite laughed softly, even as a scarlet power began to rise 
up all about him, like waves of heat. &quot;But why not? You are surely 
your mother&#39;s daughter,&quot; he mocked her. His form began to swell even 
as the dark power grew, until finally his body seemed to explode 
outward.

        &#39;Why didn&#39;t I sense any of this from him before now?&#39; Rei 
wondered, backing away from the massive creature.

        Gray, leathery skin covered him from head to toe, his formerly 
handsome face twisted and fanged. Muscles bulged along the creatures 
body, and fearsomely clawed hands stretched out, ready to be used to 
rend or kill.

        Usagi charged, her sword blazing, even as she cried out, 
&quot;Luna! Protect Rei!&quot;

        The small black cat had remained waiting in the shadows before 
her cry, but hearing Usagi&#39;s command she moved like the wind, &quot;Yes, 
mistress!&quot; The cat slid to a stop in front of Rei, shimmered faintly, 
and a black haired woman stood in the cat&#39;s place.

        &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Rei asked plaintively.

        Luna turned, giving Rei a feral smile as she said 
reassuringly, &quot;The mistress can handle him easily enough. There&#39;s no 
need to fear.&quot;

        Jadite charged, trying to slice Usagi open, but the blonde 
simply wasn&#39;t there. With a single leap she threw herself over him, 
her sword swinging down in a shining crescent. He howled, black blood 
splattering the girl.

        Trying to recover Jadite raised his hand, casting forth dark 
power against the deceptively delicate girl. Usagi simply raised her 
blade in a guard position, shining a white-gold like moonlight, and 
the shadow split around her.

        With surprising grace Usagi moved, her shining blade skimming 
close to the ground as she ran right at the much larger figure. Jadite 
uselessly tried to defend himself, but in a single graceful sweep of 
the blade she cut him in two. Black ooze sprayed her as the pieces 
fell to the ground and then gradually began to dissolve.

        &quot;Ptou! Pou!&quot; Usagi spat, trying to get some of the black gunk 
out of her mouth. &quot;Why do I always get slimed,&quot; she complained 
bitterly.

        Rei stood there, swaying slightly.

        Usagi noticed her and quietly asked, &quot;Excuse me, but do you 
have someplace where I could clean myself up?&quot;

        Rei looked at the black covered girl leaning tiredly on her 
sword, at the cat-woman standing there, then finally at the dissolving 
body of her father&#39;s helper. Bonelessly, she fell over in a dead 
faint, only prevented from hitting the floor by Luna&#39;s quick reflexes.

        &quot;She fainted,&quot; Luna said needlessly.

        &quot;The you&#39;d best take her in,&quot; the calm voice said from behind 
them. The short, bald headed man looked at them calmly, but his eyes 
widened as he took in the blade that Usagi carried. &quot;So,&quot; he said 
softly, meeting Usagi&#39;s eyes, &quot;you&#39;ve come at last.&quot;

        Ignoring that comment for now, Usagi took one end of the girl, 
Luna took the other, and they carried her into the shrine.

        Rei groaned softly, feeling a gentle hand resting on her brow. 
&quot;Good, you&#39;re awake,&quot; he said as he smiled down at her gently.

        &quot;Grandfather,&quot; Rei murmured softly. Her eyes widened, she sat 
up and the looked around wildly. No sign of any blondes or cat-girls, 
thankfully. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t believe the dream I had,&quot; Rei smiled at him 
happily.

        There was a bit of regret on his face as he said, &quot;It wasn&#39;t a 
dream.&quot;

        &quot;No it wasn&#39;t,&quot; the little black cat agreed, a crescent moon 
glowing on it&#39;s brow.

        Usagi walked in, wrapped in a towel and drying her hair from a 
quick wash. &quot;I&#39;m really sorry,&quot; Usagi bowed deeply, &quot;I didn&#39;t know one 
of the youma had beaten me here. If I had, I would have approached you 
very differently.&quot;

        &quot;Youma,&quot; Rei echoed, looking between Usagi, the cat and her 
grandfather, who seemed to be taking this all in with suspicious 
calmness. There was a bit of an edge to her voice as she asked them, 
&quot;What exactly is going on?&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t know, at least not entirely,&quot; Usagi answered her, 
having settled down to sit by Rei&#39;s mattress. She reached behind her 
and grasped the sword, laying it across her lap. She looked down at it 
as she softly said, &quot;All I do know is that the youma have been freed 
from their prison, and that I&#39;m the one who has been chosen to fight 
them.&quot; She looked up to meet Rei&#39;s gaze, looking at her with those 
shockingly blue eyes, &quot;And I need your help.&quot;

        Rei thought of the monster, the danger that Usagi had faced, 
and felt a stab of fear in her gut. Almost unwillingly she asked, &quot;And 
why should I help you?&quot;

        &quot;But, we need you,&quot; Luna asked in surprise.

        Her grandfather looked startled by the question, &quot;Rei, our 
shrine has had a long tradition of battling the supernatural forces of 
darkness. You would bring us dishonor if you...&quot;

        Usagi held up a hand, silencing him. She looked over at Rei 
and explained, &quot;I tried to avoid all this, too. When I was first 
offered this sword, I refused it.&quot; Her eyes darkened as she looked 
down at the sword, and softly said, &quot;And it was those that I loved 
that paid the price.&quot;

        There was a long beat of silence, no one quite sure what to 
say.

        &quot;Don&#39;t do this because I ask it of you, or because it&#39;s the 
right thing to do,&quot; Usagi said softly as she looked over at the short 
older man sadly, &quot;do it to protect him and everyone else that you hold 
most dearly.&quot;

        It wasn&#39;t long afterward that Usagi was walking back down the 
shrine steps in a borrowed dress. Luna was perched up on her shoulder, 
and a scowling Rei Hino walked along beside her.

        &quot;I&#39;m only helping you until the monsters are defeated,&quot; Rei 
said intensely, the miko adding, &quot;as soon as this is over, I&#39;m going 
home.&quot;

        &quot;Good enough,&quot; Usagi nodded firmly. She felt the hilt of the 
sword bump her head as she looked up into the sky. A black haired 
young man&#39;s face appeared in her mind&#39;s eye and she silently vowed, 
&#39;Mamo-chan, I will save you.&#39;
