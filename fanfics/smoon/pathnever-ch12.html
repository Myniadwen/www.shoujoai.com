<p><u>At  the hospital, outside Michiru’s room</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Is he still  there?” A nurse whispered.</p>
<p>“Of course.” Her friend  replied in the same tone. “Ever since that girl has gone  under…”</p>
<p>“No!” Came the shocked reply. “But the  schools haven’t closed, what about his education?”</p>
<p>“Don’t  be silly, of course he still goes!”</p>
<p>“He  stays overnight and then leaves early morning…And he’s back  exactly by 4:00pm every afternoon onwards.”</p>
<p>Her friend bit  her thumb thoughtfully. “What? But I thought I saw him come in  around 1:00pm yesterday.”</p>
<p>“…OH! No, no, that’s not  him. It’s a different blonde. And she’s a girl if you haven’t  noticed! She tends to show up in the early afternoons.”</p>
<p>“…But  they looked so much alike, I just thought…Well that makes a lot of  sense doesn’t it? Then I presume she’s the one whose been leaving  the flowers everyday? They are quite beautiful…” The woman  sighed. “I love that shade of blue.”</p>
<p>“Aquamarine?”</p>
<p>Before another word was exchanged, the two nurses were  interrupted abruptly by a harsh noise.</p>
<p><strong>Squueek,  squuEeEk.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Food service…”<br />
  <u></u></p>
<p><u>Haruka’s  POV, Michiru’s hospital room, early morning</u></p>
<p><u></u>So…Kaiya  has been the ones leaving the flowers. I eyed the single flower in  the vase by Michi’s bedside that seemed content to bathe in the  thin stream of sunlight entering the room through the blinds. That  brat…I’ve wondered what she’d been up to; she’s skipped  school since this whole epidemic began!</p>
<p>“What do you think  Michi?” I reached out and grasped the sleeping goddess’s cold  hand, with a sliver of hope to feel her back with me. Again I was  disappointed but I kept contact, instead wanting to warm the cold  flesh.</p>
<p>It’s been…a whole week now. I can’t believe I’ve  lasted a whole week without seeing you greet me with your smile each  morning. Going to school each day without hearing the sound of your  voice or to feel your comforting presence. It’s almost like, every  time I turn around I expect to see you behind me…smiling. But when  I turn around you never are and everything would become cold.</p>
<p>My  hand tightened around hers and I noted how it shook slightly. How…how  is it that we can be so close, yet far apart? Before, I was scared  that if I told you how I felt, I’d lose you. At least then I  could’ve watched you from afar…but now, you’re completely out  of reach.</p>
<p>Another moment of silence ensued  before I realized how late it had gotten. School would start  soon…When have I ever cared so much? I slowly picked up my bag with  an unenthusiastic, limp arm and began to head out the door when a  sudden breeze stopped me in my tracks. It smelled…nice. I turned  around. Wait, nice? Why should it? That can’t be right. It took me  a few seconds to understand that it was Kaiya’s flower that gave  off the scent. I stood there, staring mesmerized at that small,  colorful plant; it surprised me. The smell’s intensity wasn’t  normal and I know I didn’t leave the window open. …Right?</p>
<p>I  looked towards the closed window for evidence that I wasn’t going  crazy and breathed a sigh of relief to see that I wasn’t. But then  the sun attracted my gaze. Similar to the flower, it made me wonder.  Even though I feel worse than shit, even though Michi isn’t by my  side, it still rises.</p>
<p>A voice in my heart said, ‘Another  day will still begin.’</p>
<p>Heh…</p>
<p>“…You’re right  Michi.” I’m not…the only one hurting right now.</p>
<p>I think  it’s time to get off my lazy ass and I pay a visit…</p>
<p>“See  you soon…”</p>
<p><strong>Creeeeeak, click.</strong></p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s  POV, shrine</u></p>
<p>Room dimmed, door and windows are closed…I  don’t think I’m forgetting anything. Grand-pa is out teaching a  martial arts class and Yuuchiro is on the water errand. And Rei…is  in the hospital like…</p>
<p>For a last minute check, I slid the  room door open and peered into the hallway. Just making sure…I  listened for a few minutes. There were a few natural noises such as  the chirping of birds or whispers of the wind but that was it.  Everyone was still out… good. With that, I closed the door and  retreated into the prepared space.</p>
<p>It  was something that I came across a few days back…After comfortably  seating myself in the middle of the room I closed my eyes and began  taking deep breathes. For some reason, I can hear her.</p>
<p><u>The  first night, remembrance</u></p>
<p><em> Instead of waking up in  my bed or even in an underwater confinement, I was surrounded by dry  fog. Immediately I noticed the air was very dry. My eyes started to  tear, not helping my current situation in the least. It was already  difficult to make anything out; the misty substance would wander  about erratically with occasional periods of light erupting  spontaneously.</em></p>
<p><em>A voice in my head warned that I shouldn’t  move. Who knows what this place is or what could be lurking in the  shrouded cover? With that logic alone, I stood my ground and narrowed  my eyes, hoping that something would clue me in. But the thought soon  struck me as funny; what was I looking for to begin with? A way out?  It wasn’t my head that spoke to me this time, but from deeper  inside. It was asking, ‘is it <u>someon</u>e?’</em></p>
<p><em>Someone…</em></p>
<p><em><strong>SHHHHssssSSSHSsssssssHHHHHH!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong></strong>Where  did…this wind…come from!</em></p>
<p><em>But something else was  happening. The fog…it’s being blown away. In a matter of minutes  the area was clear. For the first time since I’ve been here, I  could see the ground, or… the lack of it. Instead of Earth, there  was a dark, translucent surface. It was rough but smooth. As I looked  down, I immediately noticed that I could also see my reflection,  however, that little detail only proved to anger me. The shocked look  on my face caused an instant a surge of anger in my chest; I couldn’t  believe it was me. It looked…pathetic. Like some scared little kid.</em></p>
<p><em>‘I pity you…’</em></p>
<p><em>“What? Who do you…?” I  turned and choked back a gasp.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Plip. Plip, plip.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong></strong>A  wet substance started to fall from the sky but I ignored it. I know  the rain better than anyone.</em></p>
<p><em>“Mi…chiru?”</em></p>
<p><em>It  couldn’t really be…could it? Only, her head was looking at the  ground, not at me. I thought about calling out her name again but  caught myself quickly when she suddenly looked up.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Plip.  Plip. Plip, plip, plip, pkip, plip.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>A cold shiver ran  down my spine at the sight of her hollow eyes. They weren’t  cheerful or light hearted like I was used to seeing; they held a calm  violence. But…where have I seen those eyes before? Why did they  look so familiar and what was she looking at? As soon as I had  thought that, Michiru turned her back to me and started to walk  away.</em></p>
<p><em>“Hey, where are you going! Michiru!”</em></p>
<p><em>Even if  she had answered I wouldn’t have been able to hear her; the rain  was now a thunderous crash in my  ears.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>CrrrrrraaAaaaaSssssssssssssssssHhhhhhh…</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong></strong>I’m  right here! Look at me!</em></p>
<p><em>“MICHIRU!”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Slam.</strong></em></p>
<p><u>Memory  end</u></p>
<p>At first, I wondered why she said, ‘I pity  you…’. Did it mean that she looked down on me or thought me to be  inferior in some sort of way? The thought weighed heavily on my mind  for the rest of the day. It wasn’t until the next night that I  realized that it wasn’t me she was talking to…it was someone  else. Every time I’ve fallen asleep, I see her or her shadow. Like  some sort of apparition, she’s never solid. But with each passing  dream she becomes more real. The surroundings change time to time as  well. Since the beginning the fog has completely dissipated, replaced  with scenery of a town. In fact, it looked a lot like the place from  where the three of us returned recently. At first it startled me, but  the image had also confirmed my suspicions. It definitely wasn’t  the future, so it had to be the past. Does that mean Michiru is  reliving her memories? Is that what the bug does?</p>
<p>Painful  memories…happy memories…it doesn’t matter what it is because  they are only memories. I don’t know how I can see this. I don’t  even understand why it’s always with Michiru. BUT, I do know one  thing: I’m going to find her and bring her  back!</p>
<p><u>Searching…</u></p>
<p><strong>FlaaaaaaSSSSH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>School  yard</u><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>A school yard. And as expected,  everything feels more real than the last time. This time I could feel  the sun’s warmth and the coolness of a passing breeze. As I scanned  the place, I noticed the multi colored leaves on the surrounding  trees. Fall was already here…More importantly though, where was  Michiru?</p>
<p>“What! Really?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>Two  familiar voices seemed to drift over to where I stood. Sounds  like…Haruka and Michiru…coming from… that direction. I  automatically headed towards the voices, becoming increasingly  curious as to what they were talking about; they sounded way too  cheerful, even Haruka.</p>
<p>“Wow…I never knew she had it in  her.” Haruka’s sentence exponentially increased my attention;  she’s talking a lot today. It’s the most I’ve heard her past  self speak in one go!</p>
<p>“I know…It really surprised me as  well. I couldn’t believe Nomi was pretending to be a maid this  entire time.” Michiru cheerfully replied. “It turned out that she  was gathering evidence so she could take me under her care, <em>permanently.</em>”</p>
<p>“And…”</p>
<p>“It worked!”  The aqua-haired girl giggled. “The courts unanimously ruled in Aunt  Nomi’s favor under the case of child abuse. Mother was fuming mad,  you should have seen her.”</p>
<p>“Nah, that’s okay.” Haruka  sweat dropped. “She was a bitc- er…witch.”</p>
<p>Michiru gave  the blonde a knowing look but smiled anyway. “But what made me  really happy…was the restriction.”</p>
<p>“Uh huh…Wait, what  was it again?”</p>
<p>“You’ve forgotten  already…?”</p>
<p>“Mother can’t go anywhere  near Nomi and me.”</p>
<p>“Right, I knew that.”</p>
<p>Michiru  giggled at Haruka’s slow memory and turned away from the blonde,  looking up at the sky as she did so.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty today.”  She sighed.</p>
<p>A gentle breeze rushed by and pulled her hair  back, sending up into a wave-like motion. She…really looks happy. I  wonder what Michiru is thinking right now. That train of thought was  quickly broken when the enthusiastic teen started to twirl around in  circles with wide spread arms. I tried to move back but was caught  flat-footed. In turn, just as I expected us to collide, she passed  through me.</p>
<p><em>So this is what it is like to be free.</em></p>
<p><strong>Knock!  KNOCK!</strong></p>
<p><strong>FlaaaaaaSSSSH!</strong></p>
<p><u>Shrine</u></p>
<p><strong>Bam!</strong></p>
<p>“WAH!”  What the hell?</p>
<p>“Kaaaaaaiya, you in there?”</p>
<p>Damn,  it’s Haruka! I scrambled to get up but when a sudden bright light  shot into the room I froze like a deer in the headlights.</p>
<p>“Oh,  there you are. Hmm…? What’re you doing in such a dark room? It’s  kinda…suspicious.”</p>
<p>S-suspicious? I noticed  that the last word was heavily emphasized.</p>
<p>“Ah…well you  see…meditating!” That’s right. “I was meditating. You know,  people at shrines pray and all.” Come on fall for it! I silently  begged.</p>
<p>“That so…You sure are awfully sweaty. It looks  like you’ve ran a race or something, I should know.”</p>
<p>Irk.  When did she get so perceptive?</p>
<p>“I was in intense  concentration.” And you interrupted me! “But it figures that you  wouldn’t know anything about it.”</p>
<p>Haruka twitched at the  comment. “What? Are you saying I lack concentration?”</p>
<p>“I’m  saying you are an extremely short attention spanned jock that needs  to compare everything to a sport to make a point.”</p>
<p>“…”  The other blonde narrowed her eyes. “That so?”</p>
<p>“Anyway,  don’t you have school?” Shoo.</p>
<p>“I’m actually on an  errand.”</p>
<p>“An erran- WOAH! Put me down!”</p>
<p>“Hmm…you’re  heavier than you look. Now where’s your bag?”</p>
<p>Geh…  “Don’t ignore me!” I started to hit at her back.</p>
<p>“Sorry,  I don’t understand; I’m a stupid jock remember?” She continued  to ignore my protests. “Besides, packages don’t talk. Meaning you  have zero say in this.”</p>
<p>“B-But I have to…” The  flowers…</p>
<p>To my amazement, Haruka seemed to notice my  hesitation this time round.</p>
<p>“We’ll go see her together  later, ‘kay?” I stopped hitting her.</p>
<p>“…Okay.” Umm…  “But can you put me down now…?”</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s POV,  main street of Tokyo</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Oww…did you have to be so  rough?” I noticed Kaiya was tentatively rubbing her shoulder.</p>
<p>“It  still hurts?”</p>
<p>“Of course it does! People don’t heal like  that.” She snapped her fingers.</p>
<p>Well, I guess ‘normal’  people don’t. But then again, ‘normal’ people don’t have to  worry about saving the world or wonder if they’re going to die  today.</p>
<p>“Suck it up.”</p>
<p>In a child-like way, the brat  stuck out her tongue. Ignore, ignore, ignore, she doesn’t  exist.</p>
<p>“…Hey, what do you think about this virus?”</p>
<p>I  blinked. Where the hell did that come from?</p>
<p>“It’s  crap.”</p>
<p>“Well…I think it’s taking forever for these  ‘doctors’ to get any info on it.”</p>
<p>That too…what’s  taking these guys? They can’t say they haven’t found out anything  yet. Or maybe… they don’t want to tell the public! If that’s  the case, then things could get problematic; all this waiting is  making me edgy.</p>
<p>“Definitely. If only there was something we  could do…”</p>
<p><strong>Murmer, murmer…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Speaking of  which…</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Kaiya asked</p>
<p>“How  would I know?”</p>
<p>For some reason, there was a crowd huddled  around an appliance store window. As we both approached the mob, it  became apparent that something on the television sets had caught  their fancy. But to amass this many people…</p>
<p>“Hey, let’s  check it out.”</p>
<p>Something tells me it had to do with the  virus.</p>
<p>“We interrupt the program with a special news  bulletin. None of the comatose patients have recovered and there is  still no new breakthrough concerning the disease…”</p>
<p>WHAT?  Impossible! They <em>must</em> have something! I clenched my hand into  a fist, shaking with slight outrage. Do they really think everyone is  that stupid? With what those ‘researchers’ are getting paid and  concerning the situation, I think the government is lying through  their teeth.</p>
<p>“To counter this, government officials’ has  handed the research project over to the top scientific committee  positioned at Tokyo’s exclusive Mugen Gakuen institute.”</p>
<p>Wait,  Mugen Gakuen? Say now…</p>
<p>“Isn’t that at our school?” I  vaguely heard Kaiya whisper.</p>
<p>“Guess so…Hey, come over here  for a sec.”</p>
<p>I pulled us out and away from  the crowd, making sure we were not within ear range.</p>
<p>“Listen…”  I began.</p>
<p>“Don’t bother, I see what you’re  thinking.”</p>
<p>“I’m in.”</p>
<p>Kaiya’s  grin was contagious; soon I couldn’t help but grin too. I just felt  so great then. Not every problem had to be solved with Sailor senshi,  regular people could help out too. And this was actually something  Kaiya could lend a hand without any of us worrying about dying. Maybe  jail…Ah, but we won’t get caught! It’ll work out somehow.</p>
<p>“We’ll play it old school.”</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV  Mugen Gakuen, second class</u></p>
<p>“<em>Here’s how it is.  I’m betting you anything that the research data is hidden in the  science wing’s basement. Now I’ve never been down there myself;  they keep it pretty locked tight.”</em></p>
<p><em>“That’s where I come  in right?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Right. When you hear  the…”</em></p>
<p><strong>BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNG!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“What’s  going on?”</p>
<p>“Fire alarm? Is it a practice?”</p>
<p>“What  should we do?”</p>
<p>Everyone around me whispered in panicked  tones. Our teacher however, tried to organize the students and  shouted over the alarm,</p>
<p>“Everyone line up and walk out in an  orderly fashion. Rows at the front lead, second will follow and so  forth. And last of all, stick together.”</p>
<p><em>“Leave the  classroom along with everyone else. However, when you hit the first  smokescreen, duck out and head straight to the science wing. I’ll  follow up shortly…Oh and don’t forget…”</em></p>
<p>The  smokescreen came quickly. It was set off at the cross in the hallway.  Only…</p>
<p>“Eek! What’s that awful smell!” A girl  screamed.</p>
<p>“It’s like someone let a skunk in here!”</p>
<p>“…<em>to  hold your breath.”</em></p>
<p>So that’s what she meant, she used  a stink bomb too! Why that…</p>
<p><strong>Cough, cough.</strong></p>
<p>Grr…never  mind that, I’ll deal with it later. With teary eyes I dashed left  of the hallway fork, the opposite to where my class and teacher had  disappeared. They likely won’t notice my absence until further  along the lines.</p>
<p><strong>Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Science  wing…science wing…I remember it being around here somewhere. As I  ran along the rows of lecture hall doors, I glimpsed parts of the  words that read ‘Art’, ‘Music’, ‘Modern Japanese’…I  should be getting closer or I hoped I was. I’m starting to run out  of subjects!</p>
<p><strong>BOOM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>A loud noise shook the  building.</p>
<p>Sounds like Haruka set off another stink bomb. It’s  close by…meaning I don’t have a lot of time left! She can only  distract a trailing party for so long.</p>
<p>C’mon, where are  you!</p>
<p>‘Math 113’, ‘Math114’, ‘Math115’…There it  is!</p>
<p>“Hah…hah…s-science.” I tried to regain my breath  as I inspected the long hallway that lay ahead of me. Still breathing  hard, I walked forward.</p>
<p><em>“There should be a staircase  that leads to the basement. Try to get at the lock. If you can’t,  wait for me and we’ll think of something together.”</em></p>
<p>Easily  enough I found the staircase; it was hidden in a corner of the wing.  Finding it wasn’t too hard but now that I have found it, I began to  wonder. The passageway was dark and almost entirely covered in  shadow. I couldn’t even see a light down the passageway if there  was one. Anyone could easily trip and fall…And if you did who knows  how far you’d drop? The thought of snapping me neck on a fall or  fracturing a bone didn’t appeal to me at all.</p>
<p>But…I’m  not doing this for myself. Awhile back, I might’ve thought, ‘why  should I bother becoming involved in matters that don’t concern  me?’. Maybe back then I didn’t want to become involved was  because I was afraid. I still am although I hate to admit it.</p>
<p>I stared down into the large shadow, feeling  a force beckoning me to take that first step. I’m not doing this  for me…That’s why I can do this.</p>
<p>“Right, here we  go.”</p>
<p>Tentatively I took the first step, testing the step  for stability. It didn’t creak nor bend in any sort of questioning  way to my relief. Another step followed…and then another. My hands  felt the walls for guidance and balance. It wasn’t much but it was  enough.</p>
<p>It continued on like this for another five minutes  until I spotted a faint light near the bottom. Finally…When I  reached the end, I nearly jumped onto the flat ground. That little  adventure was more unnerving than a premonition. But no matter…This  lock Haruka was talking about took precedence now. Good thing I  didn’t have to look far. As the blonde had mentioned, there was  indeed a lock in the way of our goal. A computerized one at that. I  grinned, forgetting my previous nervous for that split moment. In the  future almost everything was run by computerized systems. These  little toys are nothing.</p>
<p>Cross this wire…reconnect this five  into this passageway…</p>
<p><strong>Bleep. “Access  granted”</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Bingo.”</p>
<p>The doors parted, allowing  a thin mist to leak out. Mist? Why would there be mist in a research  lab? Whatever the place was, it triggered something; an image flashed  through my mind. But before I could grasp what it was, it was gone.  Couldn’t be…too important right?</p>
<p>I walked forward inwards  until the door shut behind me, startling me if only for a moment. The  sudden drop in light level caused the surrounding to appear dotted  until my eyes adjusted the room’s dimness. It was considerably dark  in here, even for a basement. The only light source I could make out  was the eerily glowing lamps attached to the walls. All of them  emitted a purple glow. This place wasn’t what I expected at all; I  thought it would be brighter for one…but also filled with a bunch  of test tubes and chemicals. Only, there were none to be seen.  Instead, it was a large empty space various thick wires covering the  floor, each snaking towards the same goal further down.</p>
<p>This  place… has a disturbing energy, something I can’t quite put into  words. It’s like, if you stay in one spot too long, you’ll be  devoured. By what, who knows? It could be darkness itself.</p>
<p>I  think…there’s more to this school than we think.</p>
<p><u>Mugen  Gakuen, computer room</u></p>
<p><u></u>Amazing, computers  everywhere…Does that mean they’re done with the research?</p>
<p>With that hopeful thought in mind, I cautiously proceeded towards  the main board positioned in the center of the machinery. Flashing  screens instantly surrounded me, all displaying a different set of  statistics. Momentarily distracted I found myself face to face with a  screen on my right. Its data almost made me step back. ‘Unconscious:  1000+’. The one next to it read, ‘Recovered: 10’.</p>
<p>Recovered?  So…there are people that have come out of it! But why haven’t we  heard about this? Maybe there’s something more about this on  another screen. I looked to the third, the closest monitor to the  main panel. ‘Productivity?” What do they need that for?  ‘Eliminated: 10’.</p>
<p>What…E-Eliminated? Why is it the same  number as the people that have recovered? You don’t mean…My eyes  widened.</p>
<p>I scrambled to the main monitor and quickly searched  for the files.</p>
<p><strong>Click, click, click, tap, tap  click…</strong></p>
<p>Panels were coming up like crazy, one every  split second. It really looked like someone was either very  disorganized, or they really spent a lot of time hiding this info.</p>
<p>Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>Click, tap, tap, clic-  beep!</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Restricted. Password?”</strong></p>
<p>Password…? I  don’t need one! Now that I know where it is, I’ll just bypass it.  A map of the computers internal system was brought up in a matter of  minutes, depicting numerous pathways. And in another few clicks, the  locks were all brought into view and highlighted.</p>
<p>This would  be the easiest…Cut through here and…</p>
<p><strong>BLEP.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Access  granted. Welcome back Eudial.”</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Eudial?”</p>
<p>Who  the hell is that? And wasn’t there a committee working on this? Why  does it only mention the one person?</p>
<p><strong>Whiiiiiiiiiirl.  “Transferring from main…”</strong></p>
<p>And what’s with this?  Isn’t this the main computer?</p>
<p>The screen started to shoot  up various panels of statistics, similar to the ones on the  panel…Except I was about to find the results much more  shocking.</p>
<p>Recovered: 10<br />
  Dead: 10<br />
  Infected: 1000+ and  rising<br />
  SS Profit: 0/8</p>
<p>Operation 1: In  motion.<br />
  Operation 2: Stand by.</p>
<p>What’s SS profit? Why  was it a fraction? Eight…Eight what? And the operation labeled  under number one had so many pictures of the city’s water supply.  It’s even all mapped out! Where the water leaves, which districts  it flows to, including the output concentration.</p>
<p><strong>Beep.  Beep. Beep…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>A corner of a partially hidden panel caught  my attention. The way it was flashing, could it  be...</p>
<p><strong>Click.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Whiiiiiiiiiirl…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>V-Type:  Mutating<br />
  Life span: UndeterminedIt can’t be! “This  is…”</p>
<p><strong>Cliiiick.</strong></p>
<p>I scrolled the down the  panel until I encountered the diagram of the virus’s molecular  structure.</p>
<p><strong>Name: E-cannon.</strong></p>
<p><strong>BAM!</strong></p>
<p>“NO!”  I hit the keyboard. “What’s it doing here?”</p>
<p>It  shouldn’t be here, it shouldn’t! My mind raged. I’ve known it  to be in the future but I never expected... It was so deadly by then,  that it was declared a state of emergency and everyone required  vaccination.</p>
<p><strong>Click.</strong></p>
<p>Already that thing is  emitting the classic symptoms of it’s full potential. Going  unconscious is only the beginning of many. Somehow, we have to stop  it. We have to nip this in the bud!</p>
<p><strong>Tup, tup, tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>My  gaze swept towards the doorway; footsteps were approaching. Is it  Haruka? I breathed a sigh of relief when the blonde’s head poked  through the doorway.</p>
<p>“Kaiya?”</p>
<p>“Over  here.”</p>
<p>Looking a little relieved herself Haruka closed the  door behind her and cautiously walked towards where I sat. As she did  so, I watched her give the flashing screens a wary look.</p>
<p>“They’re  nothing. You have to check this out.” I waved her over. “Take a  look at this…”</p>
<p>“What…” The blonde went silent.  Judging by her rapid eye movements, things were clicking for her as  they did for me.</p>
<p>“Michiru can’t wake up! Somehow we need  to send this entire project offline if we want to save her.” I  brought up the first operation map again. “According to the data,  everything is being run at this facility by the city’s main  reservoir. If we ca-”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>…What did she say?  “What do you mean, no?” I nearly shouted.</p>
<p>“Leave it to  the sailor senshi.” Her voice went cold and her eyes steeled. She  looked so similar to Michiru on that first night. “There’s  nothing we can do. Leave it to the sailor senshi.” Haruka’s voice  warned. There was a definite finality tone lacing those words,  stopping any other thought of protest.</p>
<p>“I…I guess.” I  paused and chose my words carefully. “But they haven’t done  anything and a week has already gone by. Do you think they already  know? Or…do you think we can warn them somehow?”</p>
<p>Haruka  stood still. That look she was giving me was absolutely  unreadable.</p>
<p>“Like you said, they had a full week. If they  haven’t figured it out by now they’re a bunch of morons who  should wake up to reality and do something.”</p>
<p>Sailor  senshi…I’m part of that group now aren’t I? Everything internal  was screaming a sense of guilt; <em>I</em> have to do something!  Haruka’s was right, normal people shouldn’t get involved.</p>
<p>“Okay.” I nodded.</p>
<p>“…Let’s head back, they’re  probably worrying about us.” She turned to leave.</p>
<p>“You go  on ahead, I’ll catch up in a sec. I have to erase the entry  point.”</p>
<p>“Better make it quick.”</p>
<p>“You got  it.”</p>
<p>And something else too. I’ll just help myself to a  copy of this data…</p>
<p><strong>Click. Blep. Blep.  Blep…Whiiiiiiiiirl…0, 5, 10, 17…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I don’t  know, but I get a feeling that this ‘Eudial’ person is behind all  this. So…</p>
<p><strong>40, 48…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Let’s leave them a  little present.</p>
<p><strong>Tap, tap, click, tap.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Confirmed.”</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Right  on time, the duplication process finished shortly after.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Blep.  “Data transfer complete.”</strong></p>
<p>Entry point is locked  up…all right, that’s about  for the disk…</p>
<p>Eject disc…And, “I’m outta here.”</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s  POV. At the park, on the way to the hospital, walking</u></p>
<p><u></u>How  bloody ironic, now I’m wishing for Michiru to stay asleep. This  entire scenario is so twisted. But I shouldn’t be surprised now, it  figures for the Death Busters to do something this crazy.</p>
<p>As  soon as I walked into that basement my instincts confirmed it. The  negative energy was almost overwhelming; I was nearly shaking. Funny  how I wished they had something to do with it. Now I can hate them  even more. For slowly taking everyone I care about away from me…  I’ll make them pay dearly for this.</p>
<p>“This the  place?”</p>
<p>“Yup.” Kaiya nodded.</p>
<p>We both stopped  short of the small lake’s shore. Kaiya scanned the water’s edge  before giving a little “There they are.” And walked over to a  patch of blue to our right.</p>
<p>The change of atmosphere gave made  my mind at ease again. I’d choose being outside in a place with  space and fresh air over a crowded school yard anyday.</p>
<p>“You  know, that was some hacking you did back there.” There was no way  I’d ever be able to do that.</p>
<p>The shorter girl bent down  and started to analyze the flower petals. “Think so?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t  I just say? Where’d you learn to do that?”</p>
<p>There was a  long silence. In that time, I strained to hear because I was afraid  the bird’s chirping would be louder.</p>
<p>“…Practice.”</p>
<p>“That’s  it?” Wait a minute, why am I so surprised? What did I expect? That  there would some easy short cut? “Ah…Anyway, what made you decide  to bring Michi flowers?” You do know she won’t be able to enjoy  them right?</p>
<p>“Oh…Well, my sis once told me that my mom  loved flowers.”</p>
<p>Her mom?</p>
<p>“She said my mom would sit  hours in a garden full of flowers’ everyday. And that her favorites  were blue ones like these. So I thought…If my mom liked them, then  maybe…” She stood up to look at me with her chosen flower.  “Michiru would too?”</p>
<p>“…” That look…</p>
<p>“What’s  wrong? Did I say something wei-”</p>
<p><strong>Tup, tup.  Whup.</strong></p>
<p>“Haruka?”</p>
<p>…reminds me of myself. I know  I’m the worst with comforting people, but I want to try.</p>
<p>“My  mom used to hug me like this whenever I was down…But hang in there,  the sailor senshi will definitely do  something.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s  hospital room, after Kaiya leaves</u></p>
<p><u></u>Everything was the way  I left it; Michiru was still asleep thank the stars. Kaiya had  already placed her flower in its designated space and left shortly  later, saying she had to check up on something at the shrine. I  wonder what she meant by it, but it was probably best to let her go.  After what we found out today, it was enough to worry anyone.</p>
<p>But  I wonder why she gave Michiru and I such a sad look? Michi is all  right, you’d think she’d be happy.</p>
<p><u>Moments  before</u></p>
<p><em>“Is something wrong?” Kaiya opened her mouth  but closed it again.</em></p>
<p><em>“No, nothing.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Cheer up,  everything will work out.”</em></p>
<p><em>“…You’re right. See you  around.”</em></p>
<p><u>End of thought</u></p>
<p>“If you  can hear me Michi, please, don’t wake up just yet. Give me a little  more time. It’ll be all over tonight. I’ll end this nightmare…  even if it costs me my life!”</p>
<p>“I  promise.”</p>
<p>So…please let me stay here a little  longer.</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV, shrine, darkened room</u></p>
<p>Someone <em>will</em> do something Haruka, I promise. But until the time comes,  I need to check up on Michiru. I’ve thought about it and concluded  that Michiru becomes more real with each encounter because she is  approaching the end of the illusion. Who knows what will happen when  that happens? Perhaps she’ll come out too early… or even worse,  she could be trapped in that state forever. Everything has to be  perfect, there’s no room for error!</p>
<p>“Here  goes…”</p>
<p><u>Searching</u></p>
<p><u></u><strong>FlaaaaaaSSSSH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Aunt  Nomi’s house</u><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Click.</strong></p>
<p>“Aunt Nomi, I’m  home.”</p>
<p>I was standing in the middle of a kitchen when I  heard Michiru’s voice greet her Aunt. Coincidentally, the addressed  party was preparing a meal behind me.</p>
<p>“How was school?”  The woman beamed when Michiru entered the space.</p>
<p>“Wonderful.” The teen gave her a peck on the cheek. She then  paused to look at the chopped up carrots and then at the stewed broth  left to boil. “Can I help you make dinner?”</p>
<p>“I know  better than to argue with you.” Nomi smiled.</p>
<p>While the two  went to work at the cutting board, my eyes began to wonder around the  place. It’s strange that her Aunt would even consider working as a  maid. By the way she lives, I’d say she’s more than well off to  afford maids to work for her! All of these fancy dishes…I wandered  over into what I hoped to be the living room. Leather couches,  hardwood floor, a multitude of animal figurines…It definitely  wasn’t a mansion like Michiru’s mom had, but it was still a  reasonably sized house. Then again, it’s inside what really matters  right?</p>
<p>Before long, the sudden change in the two’s  conversation drew me back again. “So how are things going between  you and Haruka?”</p>
<p>“Well…she’s pretty quiet. However  she’s slowly beginning to open up more.”</p>
<p>“That’s  good.”<br />
  Nomi’s voice was cheerful but she was giving Michiru a  concerned expression. It didn’t go unnoticed.</p>
<p>“Is  something wrong?”</p>
<p>By now I knew exactly what to do.  Following the routine, I lightly touched Nomi’s apparition on the  shoulder.</p>
<p><em>I want to protect you from becoming like her;  quiet, with your heart cold and locked away.</em></p>
<p>“…Michi,  do you understand why Haruka is the way she is?”</p>
<p>“Because  she lost her family.” I caught the saddened look in her aqua  eyes.</p>
<p>“That may have been part of it, but not quite.”</p>
<p>“What  do you mean?”</p>
<p>My thought exactly…</p>
<p>“She also  chose to be that way. Now before you say anything, please hear me out  first. People…cannot control what they may encounter in their  lives. But what they can control is how they take it. It is easy to  be happy when something good happens to you and the same can be said  for vice versa. However, you don’t have to be predictably happy or  sad. If you choose, you could act cold when you really are jumping  for joy inside. Such the case may be with Haruka or myself acting as  a maid.”</p>
<p>Michiru smiled at that comment.</p>
<p>“ That is  why I believe Haruka is fortunate to have someone like you as a  friend. In time, she will surely find herself again one day.”</p>
<p>“I  hope so too.”</p>
<p>“…” Nomi had a strange, distant look on  her face but it was quickly amended. “Whatever the future may  bring, always remember that you have the choice of who you want to  be.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I can take it from here; the stew  will be done shortly. Would you please set the table?”</p>
<p>“All  right.”</p>
<p>I watched Michiru disappear out of the kitchen.  Instead of following like I would have normally I decided to stay  behind out of curiosity; Nomi was hiding something. Her facial  expressions throughout the conversation said it all. Whether or not  Michiru had noticed this and chose not to say anything, I still  wanted to know.</p>
<p>The woman looked sadly into the bubbling stew  with that familiar distant look in her brown eyes.</p>
<p>“I don’t  have much time left…” She whispered.</p>
<p>What? No way! I  turned around and ran out after Michiru and made contact. What was  she thinking right now? Did she know? Instead, I found the aqua eyed  teen thinking about something else that had completely slipped my  mind.</p>
<p><em>Everything that I have ever wanted is here. I don’t  have to pretend being someone I’m not. I can dress in the manner I  wish to. There is no guard to lock me in my own house. Instead, I can  live a normal life with a caring family. Doing what other people my  age enjoy; going out on picnics, frequently visit the beach, dragging  Haruka along shopping every weekend.</em></p>
<p><em>I don’t want to leave  but I have to. Why…does must this be?</em></p>
<p>My hand shot  back; her heart was completely breaking right in front of me. She’s  talking about the day her and Haruka left, isn’t she? I thought  they left because they wanted to. What did she mean by ‘I have to’?  But she can’t leave yet! What about your Aunt?</p>
<p>“Is the  table done?” I heard the older woman call out.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The  apparition moved back towards the kitchen. However, without thinking  I grabbed a hold of her wrist. To both of our amazement I was  actually having solid contact with her.</p>
<p>And in that moment,  she could actually see me.</p>
<p>“What…?” Came the shocked  whisper.</p>
<p>Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad! I let go and jumped back.  It’s happening too fast!</p>
<p>“Who…?”</p>
<p>“Michiru, is  something wrong?”</p>
<p>I could only vaguely hear the  conversation; everything had started to revert into white light once  more. She was still looking in my direction, but her eyes were  searching; even though she knew I was right here, she couldn’t see  me any longer.</p>
<p>“No…nothing is  wrong.”</p>
<p><strong>FlaaaaaaSSSSH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Shrine</u></p>
<p>“Hah!”  I jolted awake.</p>
<p>That must be it, their departure is where  the dream will end! But she’s almost there; this time I could  actually touch her.</p>
<p>“Tonight, it has to be tonight.”</p>
<p>With  or without Uranus, I’m going!</p>
<p><u>Evening rolls  by…Outskirts of the reservoir and water plant facility</u></p>
<p><u></u>This  is it.<u></u></p>
<p><u></u>“Silence Glaive.”</p>
<p>The discs emitted  the same purple light as always and the transformation was completed  only moments later.</p>
<p>For what I’ve picked up off the disc,  there are two main entranceways and a secret back door in the water  facility. However, a complex computer system is monitoring each of  these entry points. Which means…there’s a higher chance that the  majority of security will be focused on the two main gates. My best  bet would be to infiltrate from the back door and diffuse the main  nerve connecting them all.</p>
<p>Overhead I could see the moon  disappearing behind a veil of darkness. When it disappears entirely,  then I will have my chance. My target stood relatively silent,  appearing ignorant to the attack that would proceed. It really was  something, all of those steel pipes. The metal rose up by rows,  similar to a staircase from both sides of the facility. The front,  where one of the main entrances lay, was a straight tower of smooth  concrete. Making it virtually impossible to scale. Yes, the side was  definitely my best bet.</p>
<p>Slowly the signal pushed forward and  with frustrating patience I held back. A little closer…Just a bit  longer…</p>
<p><strong>ShhhhhrrrrRroosh…</strong></p>
<p>Now!</p>
<p><strong>Tup,  tup, tup, tup, tup, tup..</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The wind blew at my back,  propelling me further towards my goal. Before I knew it, the  structure rose to meet me, towering over my smaller form. But it  didn’t deter me; on the last few approaching steps, I made them out  as large leaps. The largest of them all was the last.</p>
<p><strong>TUP!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Going  up!</p>
<p>A wall of metal pipes fell below me as I climbed in  altitude, each of them twisting and snaking around in every direction  possible. Some went horizontally, others were aligned with my  vertical path. Smaller ducts connected into each other at various  points but they are not to be concerned with.</p>
<p>Halfway there.  With that thought in mind, I waited until my feet made contact with a  chosen spot and then shot up once more.</p>
<p><strong>TUP!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tup!  Tup! Tup! Tup!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>What? I turned to look below me. Am I being  followed? A twinge of panic set in.</p>
<p><strong>FwwwwoOoOooSSsSssh…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Where  did this strong wind come from? I looked up to the sky to see the  moon had already started to reappear. It’s light ran across all  shadow and illuminated the entire area.</p>
<p>Who is  it?</p>
<p><strong>TUP!</strong></p>
<p>Before I could think, the person was  already at my side.</p>
<p>Uranus!</p>
<p>“It ends tonight.” She  muttered.</p>
<p>Both of us landed a quarter short of the secret  entrance. I began to run up one side of the wall while Uranus  mimicked my action on the other.</p>
<p>If she wants to help…then  I’ll let her. It has to end tonight!</p>
<p>“It’s up ahead, do  you see it?” I shouted.</p>
<p>“Yeah!”</p>
<p>On the last step  we both made another push off, catapulting the two of us towards the  targeted ledge. The landing went without any problem to my relief. A  fall from here could even kill a sailor senshi, our powers wouldn’t  be able to keep our skulls from being crushed.</p>
<p>“So…decided  to show up?” I asked. It came out slightly forced though; the run  had me panting slightly for breath. It appeared to be the same for  Uranus.</p>
<p>“Could say the same for you.”</p>
<p>We both  glared at each other.</p>
<p>“Don’t move.” I told the prideful  senshi of the wind. “WORLD…”</p>
<p>“Wait, what are  you-”</p>
<p>“SHAKING!”</p>
<p><strong>WhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiIIIIIRL,  CRASH! <em>Crumble… crumble…</em></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Overhead where Uranus  stood, there was now a large hole in the cemented doorway.</p>
<p>“Security  camera.”</p>
<p>“You could have just told me!” My companion  growled. Off hand I thought her mumble, “I could’ve done it  myself.”</p>
<p>Like she would’ve listened. Besides, all the  time we could spend arguing would have left us wide open.</p>
<p>“We  should go, we don’t have a lot of time.”</p>
<p>“I know  that.”</p>
<p>We stared at each other for a few more seconds  before mutually deciding to enter at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Tup,  tup, tup, tup………….</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Haruka’s POV, second  floor up from the basement</u></p>
<p>What a waste of time,  entering from the top so we could reach the bottom. Trying to get  down here we’ve encountered twenty-nine security cameras and  climbed down twenty floors. And all of it was to find what my  companion refers to as the ‘pressure point’.</p>
<p>“Hey, how  much longer?” I shouted to the blonde. Of course, she ignored me  and muttered,</p>
<p>“Camera in the top right corner behind you.  Seventy five degrees.”</p>
<p>She turned around slowly and my  target was reflected back through her  shades.</p>
<p>“WOLRD…SHAKING!”</p>
<p><strong>CRASH!</strong></p>
<p>Make  that thirty security cameras.</p>
<p>“ And I think we’re getting  closer.” She replied to my previous question.</p>
<p>“Think?”</p>
<p>The blonde nodded.</p>
<p>Oh great, we’re  lost!</p>
<p>“Sparkling wide pressure!”</p>
<p><strong>KABOOM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The  wall directly in front of us suddenly spotted a large, gaping hole.  As soon as I saw the electric sparks jumping around in the air I knew  who the morons were.</p>
<p>“It’s the inner senshi…” I  grumbled.</p>
<p>My companion walked up to my side, looking to where  I pointed. She definitely did not look impressed.</p>
<p>“Well,  they set off the alarm.”<br />
  <u>Death Buster lab, Eudial’s  master control room</u></p>
<p><strong>“Intruder!  Intruder!”</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Whaaaat!” The red headed witch shouted  at the screen. Her disbelieving face was almost pressed flat against  the surface as she scanned the changing statistics. “Who is it?”  She snarled, finally regaining herself.</p>
<p>The system shuffled  through the remaining operational cameras until it stopped on one  which contained a shot of the aggressors’ backs.</p>
<p>“Sailor  Senshi…” Eudial narrowed her eyes. “If that’s the case, we’ll  set operation two into action!”</p>
<p><strong>Click.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Operation  1: In motion.<br />
  Operation 2: Stand by.</p>
<p><strong>Blep.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rumble…rumble…rumble…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Haruka’s  POV</u></p>
<p><u></u><strong>RrrrR! RrrrR! RrrrR!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Ah! What’s  going on?” Sailor moon started to panic. The other inners walked  though their force made entrance with alarmed expressions as  well.</p>
<p>“Jupiter…” Mercury began.</p>
<p>“O-Overdid it  huh?”</p>
<p>“I knew you should have let me handle it!” Venus  joined in.</p>
<p>As if my headache couldn’t get any worse, the  moon idiot went on a rant of ‘what are we going to do?’ as she  ran around the arguing senshi.</p>
<p>“My computer said we should  have taken this entry point.”</p>
<p>“Well the main entrance  seemed closer.”</p>
<p>“Look, not everything can be fixed with  brute strength Jupiter.”</p>
<p>“What did you say?”</p>
<p>All  this noise started to push me towards the edge. They had no right to  be here! Just when we had some decent plan, a bunch of kids come  uninvited and want to play hero.</p>
<p>“The water…”</p>
<p>I  turned towards ‘shades’.</p>
<p>“What about the water?” I  almost snapped.</p>
<p><strong>Sploosh.</strong></p>
<p>On the other side of  the room one of the inners suddenly screamed, “EEK! W-Where is all  this water coming from?”</p>
<p>It’s rising!</p>
<p>“Get to  higher ground!” I called out to the younger senshi.</p>
<p>They  all abruptly stopped this quibbling and stared as if they were seeing  us for the first time.</p>
<p>“Hey, isn’t that Uranus…?”  Sailor moon asked Mercury.</p>
<p>“Yes. And someone else is with  her…”</p>
<p>“Who? Is she part of the sailor senshi too?”</p>
<p>I  stomped my foot on the floor in a frustrated rage. We’ve got no  time for this!</p>
<p><strong>BAM!</strong></p>
<p>“Get moving!”</p>
<p>This  time round they actually moved their flat feet.</p>
<p>“We’ll  take the way we came from.” ‘Shades’ automatically  ordered.</p>
<p>“Sounds good to me.”</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV,  on the escape</u></p>
<p>It had taken us nearly ten minutes to  reach the secret entranceway with barely any room to spare; the water  had continued to rise past our expectations. I never expected someone  would be so desperate that they’d flood this place!</p>
<p>“You’re  gonna have to jump!” I said as I pushed Sailor moon  out.</p>
<p>“YAAAAAAAH!”</p>
<p><strong>Thud.</strong></p>
<p>Good, she’s  hit the second ledge. All the other scouts made the leap without any  further encouragement. One by one they disappeared out of the tunnel  until only Uranus and I remained.</p>
<p>“After you.” I offered.  The blonde one of her looks but proceeded without any protest . I  followed directly after. Out of my peripheral vision the stream of  water was gaining ground. Already it had reached its final  stretch.</p>
<p><strong>Rumble…rumble…rumble…</strong></p>
<p><strong>TUP!</strong></p>
<p>Both of us cleared the runway just as the liquid shot out after us ,  only to fall short of where we had  landed.</p>
<p><strong>Craaaaaaaaaaash…</strong></p>
<p>W-Whew…I wonder  where all that came from though. Could it be…? I turned around  slowly in the direction of the reservoir that lay only a little ways  from this plant. You could barely make out the dammed wall but it was  there.</p>
<p>Wait a minute…</p>
<p>I squinted into the darkness,  training onto a moving form over by the wall. What is that? I’m not  seeing things am I?</p>
<p>“Shit!” I heard Uranus yell. “Someone  opened the dam!”</p>
<p>It was as she said. The small movement  that I had seen seconds earlier gained momentum and shot out of its  containment with ease. The eight small waterfalls poured into the  ground, following a man made pathway that had been carved into the  Earth.</p>
<p>If this keeps up, it’ll flood the city! Everyone will  be infected…</p>
<p><em>‘Infected…’</em></p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Ping.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>No!  Why now!<br />
  <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>FlaaaaaaSSSSH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><br />
  <u>Michiru’s  POV,</u> <u>Hospital room</u></p>
<p><u></u>“It can’t be true! Why  didn’t you tell me?” I looked at Aunt Nomi with an accusing eye.  I was still upset that she hadn’t informed me of her condition.</p>
<p>“You should have  also told me too…” The sickly woman replied with a weak smile.  Her statement had taken me aback.</p>
<p>“Tell… you what?” I  was afraid to hear that she knew. But I was even more afraid to show  her the tears that I desperately held back.</p>
<p>She sighed.  “Michi, it’s okay.” She took me into an embrace. “It will be  all right. I know Haruka will take good care of you.”</p>
<p>My  head shot up. So she did know…She knew we were going to  leave.</p>
<p>“But still, it does not mean that I want you to die!”  By now the tears had started to flow.</p>
<p>“I know…” Aunt  Nomi shushed.</p>
<p>Someone please tell me this isn’t happening.  It…can’t be. Just then, I felt a light pressure on my shoulder,  making me look up in turn to see a stranger’s face. The feeling I  sensed was familiar. Have I seen her before? The longer we stared at  each other, the stronger this feeling became.</p>
<p>Who are  you?</p>
<p>The blonde squeezed my shoulder gently and said, “It’s  not real.”</p>
<p>I want to die.</p>
<p><strong>FlaaaaaaSSSSH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Kaiya’s  POV, atop a series of pipes</u></p>
<p><u></u>The roaring of the crisis  came back but it could not overtake the single thought that repeated  itself in my mind.</p>
<p><em>I want to die. I want to die.</em></p>
<p>“I…want  to die.”</p>
<p>Suddenly everything started to swirl around me and  I was falling back.</p>
<p>“What are you doing!”</p>
<p>Before I  could completely fall to the raging waters below a hand shot out of  nowhere and gripped my wrist in a tight hold. Someone was shaking I  realized, but it wasn’t me. In a tired motion I slowly looked up to  the hand around my wrist and then finally up to the face of its  owner.</p>
<p>“Uranus.” I then noticed how hard she was  struggling to keep me up.</p>
<p>“Arrgh…”</p>
<p>For the world  of me, she was the last person I ever expected to save me. Even now I  couldn’t believe it, it left me in a state of shock.</p>
<p>“Hah…”  She forced a smile through a grimace. “I know this may be a bad  time, but do you have a name?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, really bad timing.”  I grinned back. “Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>“Can’t…keep  calling you ‘ally’.” She grunted.</p>
<p>A name…I never  thought my parents would care for it. But I shouldn’t tell them my  real one, at least not yet; it’s too risky. “You can call me  Rai.”</p>
<p>Uranus raised an eyebrow. “Trust? Well Rai, if you  want to get up, better make an effort too! Up… we go!”</p>
<p><strong>Thud.</strong></p>
<p>None  of us wasted any time for trivial thanks or your welcomes. Instead,  we dashed off towards where the inners waited patiently for us.</p>
<p><strong>Tup, tup,  tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Outskirts</u><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>All of the  sailor senshi soon were gathered in the outskirts of the area, a safe  enough distance from the flooding mainstream.</p>
<p>“Too…much…running.”  Moon girl groaned.</p>
<p>“Yeah, no kidding.” Venus agreed. The  goddess of love took another deep breath and looked in our direction.  “Hey, I see them!”</p>
<p>When we finally met up with the  younger girls, the first question asked was, “So what do we do  now?”</p>
<p>Uranus however looked very cold and glared at the  person who asked the question. Unfortunately it was poor Mercury.  “What do you mean by ‘we’?” The considerably smaller inner  shrunk back and Jupiter stepped forward.</p>
<p>“She meant  ‘teamwork’.”</p>
<p>I could see where this was going. Already  it was clear Jupiter and Uranus had some sort of dispute between  them.</p>
<p>“We don’t need your help.” Uranus challenged right  back. “Who do you think set off the alarm in the first  place?”</p>
<p>“Irk…That was an accident!”</p>
<p>“Well we  can’t afford ‘accidents’.”</p>
<p>I thought about it for a  moment. If we had the inners help, things might actually go about  faster. “Uranus, why not let them help?”</p>
<p>“What?” She  shot me an ‘are you crazy look’.</p>
<p>“No, I’m dead  serious. It’s true we’ve lost a lot of time but there’s no  point in worrying about time lost. If everyone is organized properly  we can make it work.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I agree!” Sailor moon  jumped in.</p>
<p>Jupiter looked at me suspiciously. “Wait, why are  you guys so interested? This has nothing to do with pure hearts.”</p>
<p>My  muscles tensed up. “Our reasons are our own. What about  you?”</p>
<p>This time all the inners’ faces looked stressed.  “Wait a minute”, Uranus cut in. “There should be five of you,  where’s Mars?”</p>
<p>Mars? That’s right, there are only four  of them. It clicked. Mars must’ve fallen ill. But the question now  was, is she already dead?</p>
<p>“That…” Mercury started.</p>
<p>“Our reasons are our own as well!” Venus finished.</p>
<p>“So  you’re determined to go through with this no matter what? Once you  decide you can’t back out.” I warned.</p>
<p>“Of course we  are!” The small blonde replied. I noticed the other inners nod as  well, agreeing with their leader.</p>
<p>“Fair enough.” I smiled.  It was the first time I ever have around this group; things may get  interesting after all. “Then this is the way we’ll do  it…”</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s POV, On the roof of a high rise  building, Tokyo’s city center</u></p>
<p><u></u><br />
  <em>“Uranus and  Sailor Moon will go back to the city. Find someplace high up and keep  an eye on the water level. We’ll be relying on you two to relay the  information back every five minutes. If anything unnatural occurs,  report it immediately.”</em></p>
<p>“Jupiter can you hear me?  Heeeello.”</p>
<p><strong>Blep.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Yeah, loud and clear.  Everything all right?”</p>
<p>“Umm…well I think it might’ve  gotten higher. Hold on, I’ll ask. Uranus, has it gotten  higher?”</p>
<p>Count to ten…Don’t lose it…It could be worse,  it could be Jupiter. “Yes, I think so.”</p>
<p>“She thinks  so.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Talk to you again in five minutes.”</p>
<p>“You  got it!”</p>
<p><strong>Blep.</strong></p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV, beside  the reservoir wall</u></p>
<p><u></u><em><br />
  As for the rest of us, Mercury,  Jupiter and Venus will stay with me. We’ll try to redirect it from  our end.</em></p>
<p>“So tell me again why you’re the leader.”  Venus asked again for the fifth time.</p>
<p>“Because I have a  plan.”</p>
<p>“She does have a point you know.” Jupiter  off-handedly mumbled.</p>
<p>“I heard that! Besides, shouldn’t  you be talking to Sailor Moon right now? It’s been five  minutes.”</p>
<p>I walked away from the two scouts to where  Mercury stood. For the last while she has been standing at that same  spot while playing around with her mini computer.</p>
<p>“Find  anything out?”</p>
<p>Her typing suddenly stopped and the visor  screen disappeared. “Not yet. For some reason I can’t bypass the  reservoir’s sixteenth lock.”</p>
<p>Probably because of this  Eudial person.</p>
<p>“Would you mind taking a look at this then?”  I took out the disc from my cargo pant pocket and handed it to the  young genius. It didn’t take much to know that with this, almost  anything was possible for Mercury.</p>
<p>“Where did you get this?”  She said half distracted.</p>
<p>“I’m resourceful.”</p>
<p>“I  can see that.” I looked onto the screen to see all the data  separate into their separate panels. “And if it’s not too much to  ask, would you explain this plan of yours? Venus and Jupiter are  going to hurt themselves at this rate.”</p>
<p>Oh right…</p>
<p>“Hey,  bring it over here you two.”</p>
<p>“So…Huff, huff…are you  going to tell us?”</p>
<p>“Yeah…”</p>
<p>“I’m going to  tell you exactly what I told Uranus. First we need to bypass the  locks on the computer system. That’ll be Mercury’s job.” I  turned to the blue haired scout. “Think you can handle it?”</p>
<p>She  nodded. “It may take some time but yes, I can do it.”</p>
<p>“All  right. As soon as the locks have been broken through, we’ll need to  throw the switch to activate the reversal mechanism of the  reservoir.”</p>
<p>“That’s where we come in right?” Jupiter  and Venus asked simultaneously.</p>
<p>“Exactly. After all the  other preparations are complete, you two need to look for the switch.  From the data, it’s a long pole positioned beside the inner part of  the wall. As soon as you see it, have Venus use her ‘love me chain’  and grab a hold of it. To get the system fully operational again,  Jupiter will have to conduct an electrical attack along Venus’s  chain and jump-start that system. Does that make sense to everyone,  or would someone like me to repeat or clarify a role?”</p>
<p>“…It  sounds all good to me, but what will you be doing?” Venus prodded.</p>
<p>She makes it sound like I’m some lazy bum who is about to  sit back and watch. However, my main role isn’t something for them  to know.</p>
<p>“I’m…the back up. If the plan fails somewhere  along the way, that’ll be where I come in.”</p>
<p>“I’m a bit  confused.”</p>
<p>“Just worry about your part Jupiter. Is that it  then?”</p>
<p>“I have one.” To my surprise it was Mercury who  spoke this time. “There are five inners and four outers. Two of the  outers are Neptune and Uranus while the third is the gatekeeper of  time, Sailor Pluto. And there is an extremely low possibility that  you are Saturn, the Sailor scout of destruction. None of your  readings match in the data base... Who are you really?”</p>
<p>“What  do your readings say?”</p>
<p>The genius frowned.  “Unreadable.”</p>
<p>I’m someone who shouldn’t exist in this  time, someone you shouldn’t have ever met. A person trained to  fight, a person filled with hate. Everything that would disgust  you…</p>
<p>The thoughts…hurt.</p>
<p>“Who am I? You guys can  call me Rai. What I am, where I come from, it’s really none of your  business, nor does it concern the situation at hand. And my reasons…  are my own.”</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>“So, let’s get  started!”</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s POV, hospital room</u></p>
<p>I  haven’t seen that girl for awhile now…In a way, I almost miss  her. Nearly as badly as I wish Haruka was here…</p>
<p>It feels so  heavy in this room. At times, I have to remind myself to breathe;  this place can almost drain the life from a person. All the color is  gone… everything has become dull. How do they expect ill people to  recover in a lifeless atmosphere? White walls, white concrete floors,  white blinds…It makes me want to cry. To think that Nomi’s last  moments will be in such a horrid place.</p>
<p>“Mm…Are you still  there Michi?”</p>
<p>“Yes, right beside you. Are the painkillers  working?” I choked back the emotions. It would be selfish to be  weak when someone else is trying so hard to be strong.</p>
<p>My  aunt nodded. No matter how often I see her, it always hurts. She has  grown so pale and thin over these past few days. I’m seeing her  waste away before my eyes.</p>
<p>“It’ll be soon now…” I  caught the whisper.</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>“Calm down Michiru. We  all knew there is no help for terminal cancer.”</p>
<p>No…No…Please…</p>
<p>“I’ve  had a good life…and the time we spent together were most precious  to me…”</p>
<p>“Being with you were the best days of my life!”  I tried to tell her. Please don’t leave me.</p>
<p>“But you will  have more.”</p>
<p>I…I don’t think so…</p>
<p><strong>Knock!  Knock!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Oh for…!”</p>
<p><strong>Bam!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“We’ll  see about that.”</p>
<p>A person who I never  thought to ever lay eyes on again staggered into the room. Her dark  eyes wildly examined the gloomy atmosphere with an insane streak to  them.</p>
<p>“So she’s come…” Nomi  muttered.</p>
<p>“Mother…?”</p>
<p>“Indeed. I’ve come to  see our guest off dearest daughter.” Her thin hand withdrew a  glimmering object from her purse. “Things will go back to the way  they used to be, just the two of us. Perhaps we can set you up with a  suitable suitor as well.” The lengthy knife then moved away from  Aunt Nomi’s direction towards me. “Or perhaps, I’ll send you  two traitors to hell together!”</p>
<p>She’s mad!</p>
<p>Somebody…</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV, reservoir</u></p>
<p><u></u><br />
  “I’ve  broken through.” Mercury finally confirmed.</p>
<p>“Great! Venus!  Jupiter! Your up!”</p>
<p>The two inner scouts were positioned up  on higher ground, near the cliff’s edge.</p>
<p>“Do you see it?”  I heard Jupiter ask Venus.</p>
<p>“Umm…Wait! I think that’s it  over there. Venus love me chain!”</p>
<p>A bright orange heart  shaped chain burst forth and shot down over the edge. I knew the  Senshi of love had snagged her target when a, “Yeeees! I got it.”  squeal filled the air.</p>
<p>“My turn then! Supreme…THUNDER!”</p>
<p>A  bolt of lightning dropped out of the sky and down the chain.</p>
<p>“How’s  it look?” I asked Mercury. Although over her shoulder I could  clearly see the power statistics rising exponentially.</p>
<p>“It’s  online. I’ll input the command.”</p>
<p>Great! Everything is  going according to plan! Now to check on Uranus…</p>
<p><strong>Blep.</strong></p>
<p>“Uranus,  Sailor Moon…somebody please respond.”</p>
<p>“…Hi! Sailor  Moon here.” She paused. “This isn’t Jupiter is it?”</p>
<p>“Ah…no,  I’m borrowing her communicator for a sec. How are we doing with the  water level? Is it going down?”</p>
<p>“Hmm…I don’t know to  be honest… Hey!”</p>
<p>I heard some shuffling in the background  and a few protesting squeals.</p>
<p>“Umm…hello?”</p>
<p>“The  water is starting to reverse its flow.” Came a deeper  voice.</p>
<p>Uranus!</p>
<p>“That’s good to hear. Things are  going smoothly over here as well. As you might’ve guessed the  system is up and running. Hopefully the streets will be clear again  shortly.”</p>
<p>“Hopefully…The bug along with it?”</p>
<p>The  bug…? That…</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“All right. Then talk to  you soon. Uranus out.”</p>
<p><strong>Blep.</strong></p>
<p><em>“Somebody.”</em></p>
<p>“Ah!”  I dropped the communicator and my hands flew to my ears. What’s  this throbbing in my head?</p>
<p>“Is something wrong?” Mercury  asked with a concerned voice.</p>
<p>“N-Nothing…Ignore  me.”</p>
<p><em>‘Somebody!’</em></p>
<p>“Geh…”  Michiru!</p>
<p><strong>FlaaaaaaSSSSH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Michiru’s  POV,</u><u>Hospital Room</u></p>
<p><u></u><br />
  “Ready to  die?”</p>
<p>“You…will not lay a finger on that girl…”</p>
<p>Aunt  Nomi? I watched in paralyzed fear as she pushed herself off the bed  and onto her feet.</p>
<p>“You think you can stop me? You’re  already one foot in the grave!”</p>
<p>Stop it you  two!</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see about that.  AHHHHHHH!”</p>
<p>Stop! “Stop!”</p>
<p><strong>SLASH!  STAB!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Ah…uh…</p>
<p>“I stopped you.” Nomi gasped.</p>
<p>“But I’m taking you down with me.” My insane mother  laughed.</p>
<p>Both women dropped to the floor, falling into a  large pool of blood. It was everywhere. Other than the floor,  droplets stained the bed sheets and wall. And in the red coloring lay  two separate knives.</p>
<p>Aunt Nomi knew…?</p>
<p>“Aunt Nomi!”  I ran to her side. As I did so, I saw that the other injured party  was deceased. “Aunt Nomi, I…Because of me…”</p>
<p>“Shh…You  can…now leave with Haruka.”</p>
<p>Don’t leave me!</p>
<p>“But  never forget…You…have…a choice.”</p>
<p><strong>Lub  dub!</strong></p>
<p><strong>FlaaaaaaSSSSH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Kaiya’s POV,  reservoir</u></p>
<p><u></u>“YAAAAAAAAAAAH!”</p>
<p>“Rai! What’s  wrong!” This time all the inners grew worried.</p>
<p>It’s  almost over! The dream is almost over!</p>
<p>“Wait, where are you  going! Stop!”</p>
<p>I could hear them yelling for me to stop but  it had to be done. I have to get rid of the bug!</p>
<p><strong>Tup, tup,  tup, tup, TUP!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fwooooooooooosh, SPLOSH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“She  jumped into the stream!”</p>
<p>“What should we do?”</p>
<p>“Venus,  can you make another chain?”</p>
<p>“I’m on  it!”</p>
<p><u>Underwater</u></p>
<p><u></u>Fast flowing water  battered ruthlessly at all sides. At first I couldn’t tell up from  down; everything was spinning and it was dark. It continued like this  for another few seconds until I finally crashed into a solid  object.</p>
<p>A rock? Whatever it was, I definitely  had stopped being thrown around like a pebble. But this was my  chance! Here’s where I pray that my own powers won’t let me down.  I hope they can keep me alive long enough.</p>
<p>Against the  current I struggled to bring my right hand to my opposite shoulder.  Just a little further…Nngh…</p>
<p><strong>RIP!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“AH!”</p>
<p>A  cloud of red shot into the water all around me. Let’s see the pests  take the taste of medicine. Obviously, they didn’t take to it so  well; around the red came spotted lights of bright green. The spots  then spread and started exploding one by one, until the numbers began  increasing exponentially. It was…all I had expected. In the future,  the thing had evolved to the point where it could block all sailor  senshi powers. A deadly pest indeed…However in its current form,  the antibodies in my blood are more than adequate for the  task!</p>
<p><strong>Poof! Poof! Poof!</strong></p>
<p>Only…It looks like I  could be screwed. This time Michiru won’t be around to save me…On  the other hand, she should be okay now. Haruka will be happy too;  they can be together again. And if they’re happy…then I’m okay  with this…</p>
<p><em>“I know this may be a bad time, but do you  have a name?”</em></p>
<p>It’s…Tenoh, Kaiya.</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s  POV, dark plane</u></p>
<p><u></u>Where…am I?</p>
<p>I wasn’t in  the hospital room anymore, but in a large empty space. There were no  walls but smooth, blue ground all around. It even had a light blue  sky.</p>
<p>“She said I had a choice.”</p>
<p>Aunt Nomi…The  image was still fresh in my mind. She died…She left me behind. I  dropped to my knees, my legs had finally given out on me twice today.  Everything felt hopeless. So much that I could almost disappear right  here.</p>
<p>I…want to see you.</p>
<p>‘Haruka…”</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s  POV, high rise roof</u></p>
<p><u></u><br />
  <em>“Haruka…”</em></p>
<p>Michiru?  Where… are you?</p>
<p><strong>FlaaaaaaSSSSH!</strong></p>

<p><u></u><br />
  You have a choice…But…what is the  point? They all left me behind…</p>
<p>“…Michiru?”</p>
<p>I  looked up to see a familiar face that I’ve missed for so long.  “Haruka? What…are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“We were going to  leave town today. Are you ready to go?”</p>
<p>…That’s right.  “We were, weren’t we?” To be anywhere but here…I started to  reach out for her outstretched hand.</p>
<p>“Wait! It’s not  real.”</p>
<p>Huh? That voice…I stopped and turned to see a  different blonde. She wasn’t as tall as Haruka was but the  resemblance startled me.</p>
<p>“You are that girl from before.”  I recognized the figure but the details would not come to  mind.</p>
<p>“Don’t run away.” She seemed to plead. “Try to  remember.”</p>
<p>Such sad aqua eyes…I could be looking into a  mirror and not known the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Tup. Tup.  Tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Another set of footsteps was approaching. The girl  with the sad eyes turned towards the noise. Oddly enough, a knowing  expression crossed her features and she smiled.</p>
<p>“Wait,  where are you going?” I called out. My heart told me that I didn’t  want her to leave, but why? As she disappeared, an older looking  Haruka appeared from the opposite direction.</p>
<p>What? Two  Harukas?</p>
<p>“I finally found you.” The older Haruka said. Her  words made me happy…But it seemed to anger the younger self.</p>
<p>“Hey,  didn’t you say we’d leave together?” She  demanded.</p>
<p>“I…I…”</p>
<p>“You already left…” This  time I could not look up at the mature voice. As she walked towards  me, I looked at the ground to avoid that extra time till we met. “We  left together a long time ago. And together, we took on the task of  searching for the talismans… Along the way, we’ve met the inner  senshi and made a new friend. You remember her don’t you Michi?  Have you forgotten about Kaiya?”</p>
<p>Kaiya…The blonde’s face  came to mind instantly this time. So the person that left…was  Kaiya?</p>
<p>“Don’t listen to her!” The younger Haruka  raged.</p>
<p>But I ignored the childish figure because…I chose  to.</p>
<p>“Things may become hard sometimes but we all have a  choice.”</p>
<p>A choice…</p>
<p>Before I knew it, the older  Haruka was kneeling down in front of me.</p>
<p>“My choice, is to  always be by your side. What’s yours Michi?” I slowly lifted my  head to stare in the pair of dark green eyes. They were sincere and  kind…</p>
<p>“Michiru!”</p>
<p>“Haruka…never calls me  Michiru.” This caught the younger self off guard. “I’m  Michi.”</p>
<p>“YAAAAAAAAAH!” The form screamed, grasping at  its head in pain. It kept screaming until it exploded into a mass of  dark energy and faded away.</p>
<p>“I’ll meet you there soon.”  I told Haruka. “There is something I have to do first.”</p>
<p>The  blonde nodded. “See you soon then.”</p>
<p><strong>FlaaaaaaSSSSH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>The  present, Michiru’s hospital room</u></p>
<p><u></u><br />
  When I opened my  eyes I was back in my hospital room. Only, I think my eyes were open;  I could see but it was as though I was looking from behind the  scenes. My body automatically left the bed and stumbled over to the  window. My arms reached up and pushed away the blinds. However,  instead of light being the first sight I see, I saw flooded  streets.</p>
<p>How much has happened since I’ve been away? And  there was so much water…Unusual color as well. The liquid surface  was no longer a dark blue, but a incredibly lighter shade. It was no  longer infected, my sense told me. But it still had to go. The  thoughts gained momentum inside my mind.</p>
<p>People are counting  on me.</p>
<p>This is the life I choose to live.</p>
<p>I’m…Sailor  Neptune!</p>
<p>A new power erupted from deep inside until I was  encircled by an aquamarine aura.</p>
<p>“Tidal…curtain!”</p>
<p><strong>FwwwOoOoooOoosh…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Haruka’s  POV, high rise roof</u></p>
<p>“Is somebody there? It’s  Uranus. Damn it, answer me!”</p>
<p><strong>Blep.</strong></p>
<p>“Uranus?  Mercury here.”</p>
<p>“The water is receding! The streets are  almost clear!”</p>
<p>“We’ve noticed it over here as well; it’s  like the water is moving on its own.”</p>
<p>On its own…? Then  that means,</p>
<p>“She’s awake. Hey, Moon kid, take over. I  gotta go!”</p>
<p>“W-what? You’re leaving me  here?”</p>
<p><strong>Tup!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I’ve got to get there before  the death busters find her!</p>
<p><u>Kaiyia’s POV,  reservoir</u></p>
<p><u></u>The water…it’s falling. I gasped for air  as the water dropped to head level.</p>
<p><strong>Cough!  Cough!</strong></p>
<p>“Hah…”</p>
<p>“There she is!”</p>
<p>“I  see her. Venus love me chain!”:</p>
<p><strong>Shink!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Venus’s  chain shot out and wrapped itself around my waist.</p>
<p>“Hang in  there, we’ll pull you up!” Jupiter called down.</p>
<p>As they  started to drag me up, I couldn’t help but laugh inwardly. I was  wrong…For the first time, I’m happy because I was wrong! What a  perplexing feeling…</p>
<p>“Put her over here.” Mercury  instructed the lightning senshi. “First we have to treat that  shoulder…”</p>
<p>I want to see them. I want to see Haruka and  Michiru.</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s POV, outside Michiru’s hospital  room, sometime later</u></p>
<p><u></u>Two doctors were making their  way in my direction, whispering to each other of their ‘hidden  agenda’.</p>
<p>“Are you sure this patient has recovered?” One  of them inquired of the other.</p>
<p>‘Of course! There’s no  mistake. According to our orders, we are to take patient 227 to the  lab.”</p>
<p>I coughed, pretending to clear my throat. “Gentlemen…”  I greeted the two.</p>
<p>“Umm…excuse me, but you’re in the  way.” The taller of the two spoke up.</p>
<p>“Am I now? Isn’t  that…too bad.”</p>
<p>“W-what?” He stuttered.</p>
<p>“Shoo.  Before I get really get angry.” I glared.</p>
<p><strong>Zip.</strong></p>
<p>And  they were outta there! Wooo…look at them go. I had to chuckle at  that.</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV, Hospital cooridor</u></p>
<p>“What’s  with that guy!”</p>
<p>“He isn’t following us is he?”</p>
<p>“What  a nuisance! And we were only following orders!”</p>
<p><strong>Bump!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Oof”  They both fell to the floor.</p>
<p>“Oh…so it was you two…” I  glared down at the considerably smaller men. Imagine that. I see Rei  and on my way to Michiru I bump into these scum.</p>
<p>“Watch  where you’re walking girl! Hey! Wait! I-I didn’t mean it.”</p>
<p><strong>Tup,  tup…</strong></p>
<p>“YAAAAAH!”</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s POV,  Outside Michiru’s room</u></p>
<p><strong>Creak…</strong></p>
<p>“Ha…ruka?”</p>
<p>My  heart skipped at the sound of her voice.</p>
<p>“Welcome  back.”</p>
<p>Michi stared up at me with tired eyes. The hospital  must’ve really tired her out I realized.</p>
<p>“Ready to go  home?”</p>
<p>Again my partner remained silent, only this time  something seemed to be on her mind. I watched as she stepped closer  until her arms had wrapped around my waist.</p>
<p>“You’re real,  aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Of course I am.” And she started to cry.  “It’s okay…I’m right here.”</p>
<p>Every muscle in my body  ached but I ignored their complaints and scooped Michi up in my arms.  She didn’t protest so I assumed she was fine with it. Besides, it  looks like she was about to fall asleep again.</p>
<p>“Hey Michi?”  I whispered to the sleepy goddess.</p>
<p>“Mm…?”</p>
<p>“I  know you might be tired tomorrow…so you should rest. But the day  after, what do you say we spend the day together? Just…the two of  us?”</p>
<p>I felt her small hand tug at my shirt. “I’d like  that.”</p>
<p>She agreed! I…I couldn’t believe it. It made  me…so happy.</p>
<p>“And Haruka? Where’s Kaiya?”</p>
<p>Kaiya…?</p>
<p><strong>Tup!  Tup! Tup! Tup!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Miiiiiiichiru! Haruuuuuuka!”</p>
<p>“Does  that answer your question?” Michi raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Hey,  what’re you guys talking about?” The blonde finally reached my  side.</p>
<p>“None of your business.”</p>
<p>“Huh? C’mon,  spill! Oh, hi Michiru. How are you feeling? Did you see my  flower?”</p>
<p>“Hello Kaiya…” She whispered. I watched as  she ruffled the blonde’s hair for a moment. “They were wonderful,  thank you. What about yourself? You look tired…”</p>
<p>“I’m  a-okay! Nothing like a little sleep won’t fix.” She  smiled.</p>
<p>“Speaking of sleep, Michi’s kinda sleepy, so try  to keep it down.” I warned the enthusiastic teen.</p>
<p>“Where  are you taking her?”</p>
