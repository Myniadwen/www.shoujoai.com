<pre>-Prequel: Victory Day-

The small princess ran to and fro out in the courtyard with an almost 
nervous energy as all around her preparations were being carried out and 
banners and balloons were hung up along with the flags of the royal 
houses. Tomorrow marked the one-hundred and first Victory Day, the day 
that began a week of celebrations set aside to commemorate the Moon 
Kingdom&#39;s victory over Beryl and the forces of Earth against 
overwhelming odds. But it was not that holiday which made tomorrow so 
special to the pink-haired child. After all, she was born well after the 
fact.

No, what she and the rest of the court were abuzz over was the second 
big event to take place tomorrow; the hundredth wedding anniversary of 
her grandparents. And it was the anniversary more than the holiday that 
caused her and the rest of the kingdom to be joyous. And the whole court 
would be arriving between today and tomorrow, even her favorite 
Princesses, Pluto and Saturn. As she gazed wide-eyed at a group of 
artisans working on an ice-sculpture of her grandparents, a hand fell 
tenderly upon her head, ruffling her hair.

&quot;So, here you are, eh?&quot;

The girl turned around happily, &quot;Momma, isn&#39;t it wonderful?&quot; she asked, 
&quot;Have you ever seen the court so pretty?&quot;

Serenity II looked around at the flowers encircling the columns of the 
palace, the tents set up for the musicians who&#39;d be performing for the 
festivities, the banquet tables and the large red and pink bows her 
daughter had put up everywhere and smiled as well. &quot;No,&quot; she agreed, &quot;I 
don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen the palace or the courtyard this beautiful 
before either.&quot;

&quot;Momma?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Well... Just how did my grandparents get together anyways?&quot;

&quot;Hmmm... Well, I suppose you&#39;re old enough now. Come,&quot; she said, taking 
her daughter&#39;s hand and leading her to a tall cherry tree. Sitting 
beneath its pink blossoms she drew the girl onto her lap. &quot;To begin 
with, this story takes place right after Queen Beryl and the forces of 
Earth were defeated.&quot;

&quot;Mom, you were there, weren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Were you scared?&quot;

&quot;I was terrified, and so was your father, though you&#39;ll never hear him 
admit it,&quot; she added with a smile and a wink. &quot;Now where was I? Oh yes, 
anyways, two days after the great battle the kingdom celebrated its very 
first Victory Day. Most of the Moon Kingdom was in ruins, but from what 
I can remember nobody seemed to care much. We were all too happy at the 
time to have survived. Anyways, in the ruins of the original palace, 
your Grandma Serenity organized a formal party for everyone, royalty and 
peasantry alike. And all attended and were happy. All except one...&quot;

----

The palace of the Dark Moon was still and silent, the only sounds coming 
from her heels striking the polished marble floor tiles as she walked 
out onto her balcony with a drink in her hand. All her subjects were out 
either on the other side of the moon or among the ruins of her own 
kingdom celebrating this first Victory Day in small family groups. They 
celebrated today both here and in the White Moon Kingdom with abandon, 
knowing full well that tomorrow would mark the beginning of the 
difficult rebuilding process.

She didn&#39;t like to be alone; she always tried to have others around her, 
to the point of setting up a separate bed for her chambermaid within her 
private bedroom. But today, she didn&#39;t feel she could bring herself to 
celebrate with others. She sat down on a chair next to a small table. 
Taking a sip of her drink, she heard a pair of familiar footsteps.

&quot;Somehow I knew you&#39;d find me,&quot; Neherenia sighed before setting the rest 
of her drink down on the table next to her, &quot;You always could, even when 
we played hide and go seek as children on diplomatic visits.&quot;

Queen Serenity looked with concern at the other woman, her shimmering 
white wings seeming to droop a bit out of a sense of unease as she came 
out onto the terrace. &quot;Neherenia, what&#39;s wrong? Why wouldn&#39;t you come 
for the celebration? And why would you choose to stay here alone?&quot;

&quot;I came here because I hoped you wouldn&#39;t find me,&quot; the Dark Queen 
admitted, staring at her glass in order to avoid eye contact with the 
beautiful woman gazing worriedly at her. &quot;And because this was your 
celebration, yours and our peoples, not mine.&quot;

A pained expression fluttered across Serenity&#39;s face at that. She 
grabbed a second chair and, bringing it over, sat across from Neherenia. 
&quot;Neherenia, how can you say such a thing? We could never have defeated 
the Earth&#39;s forces, or won the day against Beryl and Metaria, without 
your standing alongside Prince Endymion, my daughter and myself.&quot;

Neherenia said nothing as she lowered her head, her bangs hiding her 
eyes as Queen Serenity leaned closer. &quot;Was it... Was it the kiss?&quot; 
Serenity now asked, lowering her voice as she took the Dark Queen&#39;s 
hands in her own, &quot;If it was, I&#39;m sorry. I was carried away with the 
moment I suppose, and I suppose I&#39;ve had certain... feelings, for you 
for a while now. But if you don&#39;t feel that way for me...&quot;

&quot;Serenity,&quot; the Dark Queen interrupted, &quot;We&#39;ve been friends since 
childhood, ever since I first visited you and your Kingdom in the hopes 
of establishing more friendly relations between our two lands. We&#39;ve 
become almost like sisters, and no one could ever ask for a dearer or 
sweeter friend than you. But... But there are things about me, and about 
my past, that you don&#39;t know about.&quot;

&quot;Your past? Neherenia, what do you mean?&quot;

The Queen of the New Moon looked up at Serenity, her eyes welling up 
with tears. &quot;Serenity, I don&#39;t deserve to be loved,&quot; she said, her heart 
breaking as she began to tell the tale of an evil narcissistic queen 
whose only friend was her mirror, and who was so desperate to be 
beautiful forever that she stole the dreams of her subjects, turning 
them into mindless zombies. She told of a good Queen of the Full Moon 
who banished the evil queen into the mirror, and of how the evil queen 
retaliated with a curse upon the White Moon Kingdom, a curse that came 
to fruition with the end of the Silver Millennium.

She also told of a Pegasus, a circus, a beautiful princess, and of how 
the vengeful queen took delight after finally being freed from her 
prison in torturing both the princess and her friends and loved ones in 
front of her. Finally, she told of the unexpected mercy of the princess, 
of a magic born of love and sympathy that resulted in a return to 
childhood and a second chance.

&quot;I&#39;ve tried,&quot; she sobbed, shaking as she once more avoided Serenity&#39;s 
gaze, &quot;To change. I&#39;ve made friends this time, both in my own court and 
in yours. I&#39;ve done all that I could to erase my crimes of the past, but 
they&#39;re still there. I helped to save the Silver Millennium this time, 
but it was my curse that brought about its destruction the first time 
around. I&#39;m plagued by nightmares of the monster I once was, to the 
point where I suffer insomnia most nights. I try to avoid mirrors, and I 
try to always be among others so that I&#39;ll never be alone again.&quot;

Serenity looked with sympathy upon her fellow queen and friend from 
childhood, never once letting go of her friend&#39;s hand throughout the 
story. &quot;Neherenia, I&#39;m sorry. I never knew, never had any idea that you 
were dealing with anything like this. But,&quot; she said as she reached over 
to cup the side of Neherenia&#39;s face, &quot;But you are no longer the monster 
you spoke of; you&#39;re no longer a narcissist willing to steal others 
dreams or hurt innocent people to perpetuate your beauty. You&#39;re my 
friend, my closest and dearest friend since we were little girls, and 
you fought alongside me and my court when all seemed lost. I trust you 
with my life, and with that of my daughter and our subjects.&quot;

Neherenia looked up into her friend&#39;s clear blue eyes, &quot;Serenity, what 
if... What if I should go back to what I was?&quot;

&quot;If you close off love and hope from your heart, you&#39;re more in danger 
of backsliding than if you open yourself and let me in. Please,&quot; she 
pleaded, her own eyes now watering as her voice broke, &quot;Let me in. Let 
me love you, please,&quot; she whispered as she now leaned forward. The Dark 
Queen could feel her friend&#39;s breath against her face, and as she closed 
her eyes and tilted her head she felt Serenity&#39;s soft lips press against 
her own. Fear and regret melted as both queens deepened the kiss, and as 
she opened her heart to her friend a pair of glistening black wings, 
every bit as large and beautiful as Serenity&#39;s, sprouted forth from 
Neherenia&#39;s shoulders.

----

&quot;Wow...&quot; little Usagi whispered, the pink-haired girl looking wide-eyed 
up at her mother, &quot;And then what happened?&quot;

&quot;And then,&quot; a voice interrupted, &quot;They all lived happily ever after. 
Well, all except for the poor tailor who had to fix the rips and tears 
in the back of my gown when my wings popped out.&quot;

&quot;Grammy,&quot; Usagi shouted joyfully, jumping up from her moms lap as she 
ran to embrace her Grandma Neherenia. The older woman kneeled down, 
allowing the youngster to wrap her arms around her neck and bury her 
face in her hair now peppered with white and grey streaks, &quot;Grammy, 
momma was just...&quot;

&quot;Yes, I heard,&quot; Neherenia said as she scooped the child up, &quot;Now come; 
your father and your other grandmother are looking for you, as well as 
someone else...&quot;

&quot;You mean, Puu and Saturn?&quot;

Neherenia nodded her head, &quot;Just arrived in fact. They&#39;re in the west 
wing of the palace,&quot; she said as she set the little princess down, &quot;Go 
on, your mom and I&#39;ll catch up to you.&quot;

Young Usagi hugged her grandmother once more around the waist before 
turning to run through the courtyard towards the palace. Alone with 
Serenity II, Neherenia rubbed her lower back. &quot;Good grief, where did the 
time go?&quot; she asked as she and her stepdaughter slowly followed after 
the energetic girl, &quot;I can remember when I could pick up that girl with 
ease. Now look at us,&quot; she said as she rested a hand on the other 
woman&#39;s shoulder for support, &quot;She&#39;s so big now than pretty soon neither 
I nor your mother will be able to pick her up anymore. Let me tell you,&quot; 
she said, turning to Serenity II with a sardonic smile, &quot;The golden 
years aren&#39;t so golden on the back.&quot;

&quot;Why Neherenia-mama,&quot; Serenity II teased, &quot;It almost sounds as if, given 
the chance, you&#39;d try for eternal youth again.&quot;

Neherenia looked taken aback, &quot;What, and give up all this?&quot; she asked as 
her wife came into view waiting for them at the palace door, &quot;Never.&quot;

Queens Neherenia and Serenity hugged each other warmly before walking 
hand in hand back into the large marble palace, Serenity II smiling 
happily at them both as she followed them inside.
