<h1>Absence (part 42 of 60)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kirika.html">Kirika</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/absence-ch41.html">Back to Part 41</a><pre>Rei released a long, shuddering breath and leaned back against the 
Tsukino residence&#39;s front door, finally managing to escape the house. 
That was not an ordeal she wanted to experience again any time soon. It 
wasn&#39;t that Ikuko had yelled and screamed at her, no, quite the 
contrary. And that&#39;s what made the whole thing really disturbing. 
Usagi&#39;s mother had been just so... nice and calm about everything. She had 
politely inquired about the details of the Fire Senshi&#39;s relationship 
with her daughter, asking the standard questions; how long had it been 
going on, had Rei told her Grandpa yet, what was her plans for the 
future, and the like. However, then Ikuko had moved on to more... 
uncomfortable topics. Having your girlfriend&#39;s mother talk so causally 
about your sex life is just plain freaky. Ikuko had told Rei that while 
she understood that the miko wanted to make love to her daughter, she 
asked that the girl keep the noise down for Shingo and Kenji&#39;s benefit, 
since they had school and work respectively and it would not do to have 
their sleep disturbed. Plus, still in a kind and pleasant tone, the 
woman had requested that Rei not keep Usagi up too late either, since 
the blonde had school like her brother. The Senshi of Fire had merely 
sat there at the dining table, nodding weakly at the right times and 
hoping that she would somehow melt into the floor and get away from 
Ikuko before she died of embarrassment. All in all it hadn&#39;t been *too* 
bad... that is until Ikuko went on to talk about the variety of sex aids 
that a &#39;nubile young lesbian&#39; like Rei could take advantage of. Worlds 
had collided in Usagi&#39;s house, worlds that should never ever even come 
close to one another in Rei&#39;s opinion. Being pumped for personal 
information about her romantic relationship with Usagi by the blonde&#39;s 
mother was mortifying enough; having the woman discuss the different 
kinds of &#39;toys&#39; that were available for Rei to try --which the 
raven-haired girl would obviously all use on Ikuko&#39;s own daughter-- was 
more than enough to nearly make the miko spontaneously combust and for 
her brain to dribble out of her ears. At that point, Rei was about ready 
to transform into Sailor Mars and burn a path to freedom, but thankfully 
time had dragged on. In an effort to save her fraying sanity, the 
raven-haired girl had stammered out that she was going to be late for 
school and had to go right that minute. Ikuko was disappointed their 
&#39;talk&#39; was cut short, but promised they would continue it as soon as Rei 
returned. And with that dire knowledge ringing in her mind, Rei had 
promptly run like crazy out of the house.

Rei wiped the back of her hand across her brow, cleaning away the 
perspiration. Thank the gods it was all over now. Well, for the time 
being at least. She was really dreading to come home later and be 
confronted by Ikuko again. Rei lowered her head and shook it gently, 
taking a moment to collect her thoughts. She had some time to kill 
before Usagi would be finished school, so she supposed she should go to 
Minato General Hospital and help keep a watch over the injured Sailor 
Senshi. The miko felt the beginnings of a small smile tug at the corners 
of her mouth. She could also talk to Setsuna and Makoto about how well 
her and the odango atama were getting along. With rising spirits, Rei 
started walking away from the Tsukino house... only to be stopped by 
Usagi&#39;s other concerned parent.

&quot;Rei, I need to talk to you,&quot; Kenji said, appearing near the gate 
entrance to his home.

Rei gulped and felt her spirits drop rapidly into the ground once more. 
Wait! She could still use her excuse! &quot;Um, I&#39;d love to but I have to get 
to school,&quot; she said quickly, beginning to walk around the man.

&quot;This will only take a minute,&quot; Kenji insisted, moving to block Rei&#39;s 
escape.

Rei stopped and stood nervously in front of her girlfriend&#39;s father, 
idly shifting from foot to foot while she clutched her book bag tightly 
with both sweaty hands. Seeing that the Fire Senshi wasn&#39;t going to bolt 
just yet, Kenji visibly prepared himself for something, puffing out his 
chest slightly. Rei feared the worst.

&quot;Now, Rei,&quot; Kenji began, &quot;just because you&#39;re a girl doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m 
going to treat you any differently than if you were a boy. You&#39;re dating 
my little girl and that&#39;s all that matters.&quot;

&quot;Erm, yes sir,&quot; Rei said demurely, her eyes darting over the man&#39;s 
shoulder as she contemplated a break away.

Usagi&#39;s father nodded firmly, appearing to gain more confidence. &quot;Right 
then. That being said, there are certain rules that you must abide by.&quot; 
Kenji paused for a second, and then took a deep breath. &quot;Rule number 
one: I expect Usagi back no later than midnight on night outs. Ikuko 
told me that she went out on a date with you last night instead of that 
boy, and it was good to see that you brought her back before then. 
However...&quot; Kenji shuffled his feet and blushed faintly. &quot;Rule number 
two: You keep your hands off my daughter, period! She&#39;s too young for 
that sort of, eh, thing,&quot; he stated in a no-nonsense tone, which was 
only spoiled by a slight break in his voice near the end. &quot;While you&#39;re 
under my roof, and staying in Usagi&#39;s room; I *don&#39;t* want to hear what 
I heard last night! It&#39;s distracting to m-- Shingo! It&#39;s distracting to 
Shingo!&quot; he blurted, running a somewhat shaky hand through his hair. 
&quot;He&#39;s just a young boy and he can&#39;t be subjected to those, umm, kinds of 
things...&quot; Usagi&#39;s father reddened a little more, touched the bottom of 
his nose with one finger, and then looked at the digit, like he was 
checking to see if anything was on it.

&quot;Yes sir,&quot; Rei murmured, bobbing her head dutifully.

&quot;Okay then,&quot; Kenji said in a sure tone, having composed himself. He 
stepped closer to Rei and lightly put his hands on the girl&#39;s shoulders. 
The Fire Senshi&#39;s eyes flicked between each of the man&#39;s arms 
uncertainly.

&quot;Let me take a look at you,&quot; Kenji sighed. He appeared to study Rei&#39;s 
features for a few moments. &quot;At least she has taste...&quot; the senshi heard 
Usagi&#39;s father mutter to himself. And then, in a louder voice; &quot;You&#39;re a 
miko at the... the Hikawa Jinja, correct?&quot;

Rei simply nodded.

Kenji seemed to find this an acceptable profession, and continued his 
scrutiny. After several more seconds he let out another sigh, this one 
in resignation. &quot;Last rule... don&#39;t break her heart,&quot; he said solemnly, 
and then removed his hand&#39;s from the Senshi of Fire&#39;s shoulders.

&quot;I won&#39;t,&quot; Rei gravely assured her girlfriend&#39;s father. There was more 
of chance that Usagi would break *her* heart. She had done it before.

Kenji nodded in acceptance of the girl&#39;s words. It looked like Rei had 
been deemed worthy of dating the man&#39;s daughter. Kenji moved attention 
away from the miko and towards his house, squinting his eyes slightly 
behind his glasses.

&quot;I better stay outside for a while,&quot; Kenji said, scratching his head. 
&quot;Ikuko will probably want to talk all about you and Usagi... oh geez,&quot; 
he moaned.

&quot;I have to go to school now,&quot; Rei said, looking at the man with genuine 
pity in her lavender eyes. &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Tsukino,&quot; she said, and then 
bowed, before briskly walking away from Usagi&#39;s residence, glad that the 
conversation with Kenji had gone quite well.

As Rei was walking down the street, heading for the bus stop to catch a 
bus to Minato Hospital, a strange feeling came over her. It was as if 
she sensed something... like she was being... like she was being 
watched. The miko abruptly ceased her stroll and looked sharply behind 
her. There was a flash of movement in a parked dark brown car twenty 
metres or so back, which instantly heightened Rei&#39;s suspicions. 
Something was definitely wrong, but... the Senshi of Fire shook her 
head. No, she wasn&#39;t getting the vibes from behind her. Rei swivelled 
around until she had a view of the other side of the street. There were 
a few people walking along the pavement, and the occasional car drove 
by, but that was all. The miko frowned and narrowed her eyes. She was 
sensing something... something... not human. Youma. Rei scanned the 
other side of the street quickly, trying to spot anything unusual, but 
she couldn&#39;t see any signs of youma activity.

Rei swallowed and kept her gaze on the houses on the opposite side of 
the street. No... there was nothing. But that was no reason to let her 
guard down. There was still one demon-like creature out there, with most 
likely a host of youma for backup, and it was imperative she stay alert 
at all times. The miko shifted her eyes away from the suburban buildings 
and continued on her journey. She tried to shake off the feeling of 
being watched as she travelled to the bus stop, but it dogged her until 
she boarded the bus.

******

&quot;...No, wait, the senshi&#39;s mate is moving again... she failed to notice 
us,&quot; Mirerimas reported as he watched the human female through his 
optical enhancers. &quot;The two other humans are following like last time,&quot; 
the youma added as he saw the mud-coloured vehicle trundle slowly down 
the road.

Mirerimas stopped looking through the rectangular enhancers and 
straightened his posture, hearing a collection of muted cracks. The 
youma sighed tiredly and rubbed his human eyes, before picking up a 
clipboard and jotting down the recent events that had occurred near 
Usagi Tsukino&#39;s living area. Mirerimas always got stuck with 
surveillance work since he wasn&#39;t very adept at maintaining a convincing 
human disguise. The youma touched his bumpy face, feeling the 
disfigurements in his human masquerade. Damn human bone structure was 
hard to duplicate. However, Mirerimas&#39; disguise was sufficient enough 
for long-range spy work, which was why he was currently at a second 
storey window in an unoccupied and almost totally empty house.

It was usually a mind-numbingly boring job, surveillance, since more 
often than not it was a single youma task. Mirerimas&#39; kind had 
incredible stamina and could go for days, even weeks, without sleep. 
However, this time Mirerimas had company. And what famous company it was 
too.

Mirerimas twirled on his stool to face the lone figure sitting in a dark 
corner of the room, just beyond the line of sunlight from the partially 
curtained window. &quot;Nothing to do now but wait until they come back from 
school. I guess we&#39;ll have more luck tomorrow,&quot; the youma said with a 
bright, engaging, yet horrific smile, hoping to perhaps start up a 
conversation with the masked assassin.

The Night Haunter said nothing, merely sitting on the floor with his 
head bent and his forearms resting on his knees. Mirerimas&#39; smile waned 
and fell off his ugly visage altogether. All Lazarus had done since 
coming to his surveillance outpost was sit in a corner during the day, 
and watch the target and her mate through a window at night. Mirerimas 
had heard from his youma food supplier that the black-clad assassin had 
visited every other Sailor Senshi surveillance outpost too, but for some 
reason had remained at his. Mirerimas felt a little honoured, and a bit 
smug too, at having been singled out by someone so illustrious. But the 
social interaction left much to be desired.

The disfigured youma gulped nervously and gathered his courage to ask 
why Lazarus was here in the first place. Mirerimas had asked before, but 
had only received a cold stare from the weeping mask in reply. He had to 
admit; the assassin was pretty intimidating.

&quot;U-Uh, sir, I was wondering... um, well,&quot; the youma stumbled. &quot;Why are 
you here?&quot; he suddenly blurted out. Mirerimas paled as he realised his 
question sounded a little aggressive. &quot;I-I-I mean, it&#39;s just, this place 
isn&#39;t very important, and well, it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t like the company, 
I do, I--&quot;

&quot;I was searching for someone,&quot; Lazarus rasped, interrupting the jittery 
youma&#39;s babbling.

&quot;Searching...?&quot; Mirerimas parroted cautiously, surprised the assassin 
had actually spoke.

The Night Haunter was quiet for a while, and Mirerimas thought the 
Silent Blades chief had reverted back to his mute state. However, the 
black swathed figure spoke once more.

&quot;I had heard a tale, and I wished to see if it were true... but now I 
know it is. That one, that human female... the mate of the other... she 
is the *one*,&quot; Lazarus whispered.

Mirerimas blinked at the assassin and then eagerly leaned forward on his 
stool, wanting to hear more. His companion was actually talking about 
something for once. The scarred youma didn&#39;t risk saying anything in 
fear that if he did, Lazarus would clam up again. Unfortunately, 
Mirerimas&#39; plan backfired and the masked assassin did indeed stop 
talking. Wishing to keep the conversation alive, and now quite curious, 
the youma spy decided to ask a probing question.

&quot;&#39;A tale&#39;?&quot; he said, hoping to prompt Lazarus into talking.

To Mirerimas&#39; relief, the Night Haunter started speaking. &quot;A tale of a 
formidable human warrior who Death shies away from. A female warrior 
with the fury of flames as her ally...&quot;

&quot;You mean the one who took out Lord Khairephon&#39;s entire outfit, 
including the Lord himself?? *That* one? Are you saying that the Sailor 
Senshi&#39;s mate is the being responsible??&quot; Mirerimas said in disbelief, 
forgetting his fear. &quot;You can&#39;t be serious... I&#39;ve read intel on her, 
and that human down there can&#39;t be her!&quot;

Lazarus was silent for a few minutes, Mirerimas&#39; outburst lingering in 
the air. The youma spy gulped and prayed the Night Haunter wouldn&#39;t slay 
him where he sat. But instead, the assassin responded only with speech 
to Mirerimas&#39; comments, rather than a swift death. &quot;She is the one. The 
Web of Time... its strands flux and twist around her. That alone assures 
me I am right,&quot; the masked figure murmured.

&quot;Huh?&quot; the ugly youma said, perplexed. &quot;I&#39;m not really familiar with any 
theories of the continuum...&quot;

&quot;Back on my home planet,&quot; Lazarus said, &quot;there is a tale. A myth. It is 
said that when a being is born the gods toss a coin to determine its 
destiny, for either good or ill. But sometimes... sometimes, rarely, the 
coin lands on its edge. It is said those beings are born without a 
destiny, free to live their lives as they please, without the barriers 
that normal creatures are subjected to. Their fate is their own to 
determine.&quot;

Mirerimas took a moment to digest the Night Haunter&#39;s story. &quot;So that 
human is one of those beings?&quot; he said somewhat breathlessly.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. It is only a tale,&quot; the masked youma whispered. &quot;But I 
have only seen one other like her before. And he was a dangerous 
individual. Eternal bonds where broken in his wake, destinies crushed, 
the future rewritten... but Time and Fate are harsh foes, and are not 
always so easily beaten. Sometimes a little extra help is necessary...&quot; 
Lazarus looked up at Mirerimas, his black tragic mask chilling the youma 
spy to the core. &quot;But such things usually come with a price.&quot;

Setsuna was sitting up straight in her hospital bed, vigilantly watching 
her closed door. Waiting. She knew it was a foolish activity to stare at 
the door waiting for the girl&#39;s arrival, since she knew precisely when 
the Inner Senshi would enter, but the Guardian of Time had been doing 
many foolish things lately. The green-haired woman let out a small sigh. 
Was she really becoming this pathetic? This desperate? Was she so 
starved for love she would take any attention from anybody and latch on 
to it for dear life? That she was now considering members of the same 
sex as potential life partners was a sure sign of her hopelessness. Had 
living with Haruka and Michiru turned her that way somehow? Setsuna 
shook her head, aggravated with herself. Now she *really* was being 
foolish.

After Rei had declared that she would challenge the hold Fate had on 
Usagi and Mamoru, the Senshi of Time had been enthused with a new hope. 
If the Fire Senshi succeeded in her quest, then perhaps there was a 
chance Setsuna could escape her lonely fate as well. And also, if Rei 
were victorious, it would leave a poor and vulnerable Mamoru ripe for 
the picking. The Guardian of Time had always felt an attraction to the 
future King of Earth to some extent, though she would never admit it to 
anybody. And so, she had felt confident and happy... for a time. Knowing 
what the future holds is a burden that can destroy optimism like a 
crashing wave can destroy a sandcastle: swiftly and without mercy. The 
future Setsuna had seen... did not bode well.

Perhaps that is why the green-haired woman had strayed away from her 
idea of capturing Mamoru&#39;s heart. But to stray towards another woman? 
And merely a high school girl, no less! Such an age difference... but 
then that could be said for any person she chose to be with.

Setsuna heard a loud rap on the door, breaking her out of her reverie. 
&quot;Come in!&quot; she called out a little too eagerly. She had to get a grip on 
herself.

Rei came in and gave the bed-ridden Guardian of Time a cheerful smile, 
and then an equally cheerful greeting. Setsuna smiled faintly in return, 
appearing as calm and controlled as ever. However, internally her heart 
was stirring with an unfamiliar but pleasant feeling at the sight of the 
Senshi of Fire.

&quot;Setsuna! I have so much to tell you! Everything is going great, just 
GREAT!&quot; Rei gushed with glee as she sat in the chair beside the Senshi 
of Time&#39;s bed, bouncing excitedly up and down.

&quot;Indeed...&quot; Setsuna said in a restrained voice, but couldn&#39;t stop the 
steadily growing smile pulling on her lips.

&quot;Usagi and I... it&#39;s all so... perfect between us,&quot; the miko sighed 
dreamily, gazing off into space, no doubt picturing her love.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you tell me all about it?&quot; the Guardian of Time suggested 
warmly, knowing that was what the girl wanted, even if the green-haired 
woman already knew all of the facts.

Rei readily commenced yammering about how her relationship with the Moon 
Princess was progressing, and Setsuna listened indulgently to the Fire 
Senshi, smiling and inclining her head at appropriate times. How had she 
fallen for the girl? When had she? Was there a feeling in her heart for 
Rei on that dark day at the cemetery; had the broken Inner Senshi 
invoked more than sympathy in the Guardian of Time back then? Or was it 
when Setsuna had met the miko in Yokohama, witnessing the cold and dying 
fires in her exquisite lavender eyes? Perhaps it had been later, after 
Rei had shown such courage and determination to fight against Destiny, 
no matter what the cost to herself. Honestly, Setsuna didn&#39;t know, 
despite all her supposed &#39;great wisdom&#39;. All she knew was that she felt 
something for the girl before her, something that gave her divine bliss 
and yet, torturous pain. The Guardian of Time knew that Rei only loved 
Usagi, and that the miko would never ever return her love. Rei viewed 
Setsuna more as a guide, a mentor, for her sortie against Destiny. The 
Senshi of Time wished with all that she was that she could help Rei more 
with her fight; the green- haired woman had knowledge that would save 
the poor girl so much suffering. Setsuna wanted to tell the object of 
her affection everything; how it would all end, what to do... but... 
even if she could, the Guardian of Time doubted that the Senshi of Fire 
would listen. Love was a strong emotion, and it could blind you; it 
could make you do things you wouldn&#39;t so much as consider in any other 
circumstances. Setsuna knew that all too well.

Soon, Rei ran out of steam and relaxed back in her seat with a peaceful 
expression over her face, her ode to Usagi finished. Setsuna snuffed out 
a tiny grain of jealously floating around inside her, and then smiled 
cordially at her passionate charge... at her love.

&quot;I am pleased that you are happy,&quot; Setsuna said truthfully as she gazed 
at the girl. Rei let out an absent hum of recognition, her eyes glazed 
over.

&quot;I have some information for you,&quot; the Senshi of Time said, the 
declaration coming unbidden to her mouth. The green-haired woman&#39;s eyes 
widened almost imperceptibly, and she paused with her lips slightly 
parted.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Rei inquired, blinking at Setsuna with her lovely eyes.

The Guardian of Time swallowed. What was she doing?! She couldn&#39;t tell 
Rei about the possible future, no matter how much she cared for the 
girl. Setsuna had bent the rules too much as it was; her feeble 
justifications for calling back Rei from Yokohama, and for informing the 
other senshi about the attack at the hospital before it even happened, 
when she shouldn&#39;t have known at all if she wasn&#39;t the Guardian of Time. 
But it was all right this time. This one time *was* truly justified. It 
related to the unauthorised viewing of the timeline using an arcane 
mystical device, rather than using a psychic gift, and that fell under 
the Senshi of Time&#39;s jurisdiction, did it not? Setsuna was simply 
enlisting some help from her charge, since she herself was in no 
condition to deal with the problem. Yes, that was it.

&quot;Setsuna...? Are you all right? Rei asked, concerned at the older 
woman&#39;s silence.

Setsuna blinked at the girl briefly, and hastily composed herself. &quot;Yes, 
I am fine,&quot; she assured the miko. The Guardian of Time then paused once 
more, appearing indecisive. No, it was justified. &quot;Now, the 
information,&quot; Setsuna continued with a slight stuttering in her words, 
barely noticeable. &quot;Soon, in three or four days time, you will encounter 
a truly perilous assailant. His skills in the art of stealth and murder 
are of a superior level, but that is not where the real threat lies. He 
wears a mask... an ancient artefact from where I do not know, but with 
abilities that imbue the wearer with seemingly incredible luck. But in 
truth, the mask allows one to see the possible threads of Time, not too 
far in Time, but enough to let the wearer know which thread to take, 
which action to choose, so to always steer clear of danger.&quot; Setsuna 
gazed into Rei&#39;s eyes with her own crimson ones. &quot;Be wary of him,&quot; she 
warned earnestly, fearing for the girl&#39;s safety.

Setsuna watched Rei as the Fire Senshi&#39;s mind wrapped around what she 
had said. The Senshi of Time knew what the girl was thinking. Perhaps it 
would have been best if she had stayed silent. With a mask like that, 
Rei could not only steer clear of danger herself, but also steer a sure 
path to Usagi&#39;s eternal love. But of course, there was more to it. When 
was there not? Setsuna had refrained from telling the Senshi of Fire 
everything, despite the risk to her love. Some things had to be faced 
alone... she just prayed that when the time came, Rei would make the 
right choice.

Hotaru sat cross-legged on the floor in the Mizuno&#39;s living room, 
quietly reading a book while Michiru-mama slept on the couch. 
Michiru-mama was still very sickly, and it didn&#39;t take a lot to tire her 
out. It was almost silent in the apartment, the sound of ticking clocks 
and cars driving outside the only noise. Hotaru wasn&#39;t bored being more 
or less by herself, although she missed attending school with Chibi-Usa. 
But it was necessary to hide away from the youma. And anyway she was 
still pretty tired from regularly healing the hurt Sailor Senshi. All 
the hurt Sailor Senshi except Setsuna-mama; she still insisted that the 
Senshi of Rebirth ignore her and concentrate on Makoto instead. However, 
Hotaru just couldn&#39;t ignore her Haruka-papa and Michiru-mama either, so 
now the young girl&#39;s energy was being spread a little thin.

Hotaru was suddenly startled by a series of loud knocks on the 
apartment&#39;s front door, making the girl jump and drop her book. Not 
wanting Michiru-mama&#39;s rest to be disturbed, the Senshi of Rebirth 
quickly ran to the door as the rapid knocks continued. Hotaru stood on 
her tiptoes and peeked out the spy hole, hoping not to see a horrible 
monster grinning evilly back at her. But there was no horrible monster, 
or anybody for that matter, and yet the knocks didn&#39;t stop. Hotaru&#39;s 
brow creased in mild bewilderment and she decided to risk opening the 
door a crack.

As Hotaru opened the door and poked her head out, it was abruptly torn 
from the Senshi of Rebirth&#39;s grasp as a pink mass threw itself at her, 
latching around her waist and causing her to stagger a few steps 
backwards. At first Hotaru thought she was under attack by some fierce 
youma, but then she realised the pink-haired bundle was crying her name.

Hotaru blinked down at the quivering girl attached to her waist, and 
then quietly shut and locked the apartment door. She gently placed one 
hand on the shorter girl&#39;s head and stroked her hair soothingly as the 
girl sobbed, her tears wetting Hotaru&#39;s black top. The Senshi of Rebirth 
felt her own tears beginning to form as she tried to comfort her best 
friend. The dark-haired girl didn&#39;t like it when Chibi-Usa was sad; it 
made her sad too. Something must have upset her a lot for the girl to be 
in such a state.

Hotaru guided Chibi-Usa into Ami&#39;s bedroom, so that they wouldn&#39;t have 
to be quiet for Michiru-mama&#39;s sake. The pale girl sat her sniffling 
friend on Ami&#39;s bed and then picked up a box of tissues from the bedside 
table, before sitting herself beside the distraught girl. She offered 
the tissues to Chibi-Usa, and the pink-haired girl used some to dry her 
eyes and blow her nose.

&quot;Chibi-Usa, please tell me what&#39;s wrong,&quot; Hotaru asked softly with 
concern lacing her voice and expression, after her friend had seemed to 
recover a bit.

The pink-haired princess took a couple of heaving breaths and a few 
stray tears leaked out of her eyes, trickling down her cheeks. &quot;I-It&#39;s 
Usagi... a-a-and Rei,&quot; she blubbered, before blowing her nose again.

Hotaru remained quiet, letting her best friend explain at her own pace 
as she listened intently.

&quot;Th-They&#39;re-- they&#39;re in love or something!&quot; Chibi-Usa cried, bursting 
into a new flood of tears.

&quot;&#39;In love&#39;?&quot; Hotaru repeated, somewhat puzzled. &quot;You mean like 
Haruka-papa and Michiru-mama?&quot;

Chibi-Usa nodded her head gravely. &quot;I c-caught them... they w-were... 
hugging,&quot; she sniffed.

&quot;B-But we hug all the time...&quot; Hotaru said timidly. She lowered her 
head, letting her dark hair obscure her now lightly pink-hued cheeks.

The future princess paused for a short period, and then shook her head, 
her pink hair waving. &quot;No, it&#39;s true! Usagi&#39;s mom said so!&quot; she wailed 
in despair. &quot;What about Mamoru, Hotaru?! He&#39;s meant to be my dad, if 
Usagi loves Rei, then he won&#39;t be! How can I be born if Mamoru isn&#39;t my 
dad?! I won&#39;t come here; I won&#39;t meet you or anybody else! I won&#39;t 
EXIST!!&quot; Chibi-Usa lamented, and then buried her face in her best 
friend&#39;s lap, weeping her heart out.

Hotaru put one hand on Chibi-Usa&#39;s back and rubbed it lovingly, 
attempting to ease the girl&#39;s pain. She continued her ministrations and 
gradually the pink-haired girl&#39;s crying began to lessen, only the 
occasional whimper being heard. The Senshi of Rebirth ran her other hand 
through Chibi-Usa&#39;s silky pink hair, caressing the locks and relaxing 
the girl. Could it be true? Hotaru didn&#39;t think it was possible, but 
Chibi-Usa was so adamant and certain. Usagi couldn&#39;t love Rei; they were 
just good friends, like her and... and Chibi-Usa. Hotaru stopped her 
comforting of the pink-haired girl for a brief instant and then resumed 
it. No. Usagi and Rei wouldn&#39;t do something like that. Neither of them 
would willingly doom Chibi-Usa like that... would they? The Hotaru 
didn&#39;t think so, but as her best friend trembled in her lap, she found 
it hard to agree with the words. Maybe she should talk to Haruka-papa or 
Michiru-mama about it. No wait, they were both sick, as was 
Setsuna-mama. Hotaru didn&#39;t want to bother them when they weren&#39;t 
feeling well. She should go to the source instead, and talk to Usagi or 
Rei. Then she would get answers.

&quot;Hotaru... I&#39;m scared,&quot; Chibi-Usa whispered in a small voice, shivering.

Hotaru looked down at her disconcerted friend. &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; she said 
soothingly, still tracing her pale hands over the pink-haired girl&#39;s 
back and head. &quot;It&#39;ll all be okay. I promise.&quot;

But Hotaru, the Senshi of Death, knew that whatever she learned, she 
wouldn&#39;t let any harm come to her best friend, Chibi-Usa. No matter what 
shape or form it came in.

Author&#39;s ramblings:

I had always intended for another Sailor Senshi to fall for Rei right 
from the very start. I considered Minako, but I thought she was too 
similar to Usagi. And so, after casting Setsuna as a guide sort of 
character for Rei in chapter 3, I decided for her to be the one.</pre>
