<h1>Slowly Dawning (part 2 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/slowdawn-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Minako stifled a yawn and tried to watch attentively as another 
fifteen minutes crawled by. Rei had invited her to see an exhibition 
of Kyudo, Japanese archery. Minako knew that Rei studied Kyudo, in 
fact, had seen her deadly aim with her Flame Sniper, but had never 
seen the incredibly formal Kyudo itself. It was elegant, 
graceful...and as interesting as watching paint dry.

Minako found her mind wandering. Yuki and Rei had hit it off 
immediately, as she had suspected. Its a good thing, she thought, when 
your friends like each other. The three of them had shopped all 
afternoon, and parted with promises for another outing together. Most 
importantly, Yuki had liked Rei. Hopefully, once Yuki knew who 
Minako&#146;s close friends were, she wouldn&#146;t be so jealous. Minako could 
hardly tell Yuki that in reality she was Sailor Venus, one of the 
Sailor Senshi. What would Yuki have thought, knowing she was at lunch 
with Sailor Mars and Sailor Venus! Minako stifled a laugh, looking 
around to see if anyone noticed. No one had.

At last Rei stood and took her place in front of the target. She 
kneeled gracefully, preparing herself for her trial. She placed her 
bow in the proper position, and drew. A minute went by, then another. 
Minako felt sweat run down her forehead and tried very hard to relax. 
Rei looked calm and peaceful, her elbow up, arm pulled back, face 
serene. Time passed and Minako found herself straining forward, 
looking for any change in Rei&#146;s posture. There was none. Rei seemed 
immovable, carved in stone. Minako was completely enrapt. Rei was 
truly magnificent to watch. Her hair, pulled back, lay heavily along 
her back, her shoulders were firm and her back straight. Minako 
realized she was holding her breath. She took in the tranquil 
expression on Rei&#146;s face and marveled at the darker girl&#146;s features. 
Where she was used to seeing anger or annoyance, now sat repose. 
Minako was suddenly engrossed by Rei&#146;s beauty.

With a twang and a sigh, Rei loosed the arrow from her bow and Minako 
gasped with the rest of the onlookers. The arrow was true and struck 
in the center of the target. A cry of pleasure went up from the 
audience and Rei stepped back to allow the next archer up.

When the exhibition had ended, Minako met Rei in front of the school 
and offered to walk her home.

&quot;That was truly amazing Rei-chan!&quot; Minako gushed. She noticed Rei 
color faintly at the compliment and she continued. &quot;I always thought 
that stuff was kind of boring, but watching you...wow!&quot;

Rei demurred. &quot;I&#146;m not very good. My teacher - he&#146;s really excellent.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m not talking about your archery.&quot; Minako said before she caught 
herself. Rei turned and looked at her sharply. Minako laughed. &quot;All 
that Flame Sniper work has really paid off, huh?&quot;

Rei agreed hastily. The two girls walked along chatting about nothing 
in particular. 

Minako heaved a terrific sigh and put her hands behind her head. 
&quot;Rei-chan, when was the last time you went on a date?&quot;

Rei looked confused at the sudden change of topic, but said, &quot;I don&#146;t 
know - last month, I guess. Why?&quot;

&quot;Did you go out with him long?&quot;

&quot;Not really. Why?&quot;

&quot;Why don&#146;t we have steady boyfriends?&quot; Minako cried out to the 
universe. She grabbed Rei around the shoulders. &quot;Look at us! We&#146;re 
young, we&#146;re beautiful, we&#146;re talented...&quot; she pinched Rei&#146;s cheek and 
sighed again.

&quot;Actually,&quot; Rei admitted reluctantly, &quot;I had to stop seeing him. I had 
too many duties, as a Senshi, at the shrine...I had to keep canceling 
dates.&quot; she sighed wistfully. &quot;The last time, I actually ran out on 
him while we were watching a movie...and it had just gotten to the 
romantic part.&quot;

&quot;We&#146;re the girlfriends from hell.&quot; Minako agreed ruefully.
