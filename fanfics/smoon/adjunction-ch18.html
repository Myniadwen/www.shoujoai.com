<p>The Final Stretch.</p>
<p><em>Maybe  she's a missionary from KAmi-sama. Sent to kick me off my comfortable  bum.</em></p>
<p>She leaned down,  unclasping Eika's hair clip and setting it to the side so that it  wouldn't hurt when she rolled over. Eika continued to sleep.</p>
<p>Rei stood up,  and with one last look, closed the door behind her. <em>I guess it's  true what they say; people resemble angels most when they're sound  asleep.</em></p>
<p>A  silhouette disappeared down the stairway out of sight just as Rei  turned the corner to see the entrance.</p>
<p><em>What...?</em></p>
<p>Rei ran after it.  She was sure she had seen... that hair, floating like a wedding train  behind a runaway bride, she'd seen it all too many times...</p>
<p>She was too late.  By the time she got halfway down the stairs, she heard the quiet rush  of a car speeding away.</p>
<p>Rei fell back,  landing with a thud on the cold, hard steps.</p>
<p>-.-.-.- Friday  Morning -.-.-.-</p>
<p>“Where's  Motoki-san today?”</p>
<p>Makoto  set down the flower pot she was bringing out front, fixing the stray  bits here and there before feeling satisfied. Going over to Ami, who  was enjoying a glass of fresh lemonade,  she smiled offhandedly.</p>
<p>“I gave him the day off. I really  have been absent too long, but when certain customers insist...”</p>
<p>Ami nodded in acknowledgment. “Have  you planned any other wedding flora?”</p>
<p>Makoto shook her head noticing that  the plant beside Ami could use some trimming. As she fished out her  shears from a pocket in her apron, she murmured, “Weddings are too  hectic. I had a case last month- from a client that I'd known all  year? She was completely different when her wedding was closing in.  She calmed down after it was over with though. I did get two offers  for the course of this next year though.”</p>
<p>“Are you taking them?”</p>
<p>“Well... one's planning on having  her wedding in Okinawa, but she insisted that she wanted, um, my hand  in the decoration matters... and the other... well... is from a <em>really</em> famous person... I  don't know if I'm supposed to be officially calling it a 'wedding'  though. They insist, but...”</p>
<p>“Where's that  one?”</p>
<p>Makoto coughed,  blushing slightly. “It hasn't really been decided yet. They were  talking of Holland, but I'm not sure if it was a joke or what. They  did laugh a little at that.”</p>
<p>“Ehh... Holland,  hm? Interesting...”</p>
<p>“Is it?”  Makoto continued her daily scan of shrubbery perfection.</p>
<p>Before Ami could  say more, her cell phone went off. She apologized before taking the  call, which berated that she was long since due back at the hospital.</p>
<p>“You're going?”</p>
<p>Ami nodded,  standing up. Makoto held out a hand for the glass, and Ami smiled  and gave it to her, pausing a moment to wrap her other hand around  Makoto's extended one. Softly, she requested, “I'll see you at the  concert tonight, right?”</p>
<p>“That should be  my line. Don't overwork yourself to the point of being dead on your  feet, promise?”</p>
<p>Ami casually  withdrew, grinning happily. “I'll be okay, don't worry! I'm used  to it already, so it's fine. Take care. And see you tonight then.”</p>
<p>Makoto nodded, a  small smile on her face. She waved as Ami got into her car, slipping  into the easy traffic like a marble down a binder. She then shook  her head, amazed that things had gone as well as they did.</p>
<p><em>If only Rei and  Minako...</em></p>
<p>She shook it off  again. They'd find their happiness. Sooner or later. They were  meant to.</p>
<p>They just were.</p>
<p>-.-.- Friday Night  -.-.-</p>
<p>“What do you  mean 'I can't see her'! <em>She</em> gave me the pass!”</p>
<p>The bodyguard was  gruff, coughing hard but short. Every time he did that, he seemed to  grow an inch, even though he already towered over Rei, who wasn't  intimidated in the least. Not by him anyway. “Those were her  orders.”</p>
<p>Rei growled, “Why?   Why would she do that?” Though she already guessed the answer.  No, she had already been <em>told</em> the answer.</p>
<p>The bodyguard  puffed out his broad chest again. “No one is authorized to disturb  Aino-san before her important concert.”</p>
<p>“<em>I</em> am!  How can a best friend wish her luck from here!”</p>
<p>“Her orders were  very clear.”</p>
<p>“And since when  have these 'orders' been given!”</p>
<p>“... Since I was  assigned to duty on Wednesday. Now please leave the premises, or  else I shall be forced to...”</p>
<p>Rei's  heart sunk, not even registering the open-ended threat. It <em>was</em> that. She cursed and turned on her heel. “Fine! I got it! Geez.   Of all the stupid...”</p>
<p>Further down the  hall, the dressing room door closed the crack that it had been open  to.</p>
<p>-.-.-.-  Thursday Night -.-.-.-</p>
<p>“I'm home! Motoki? You there?”</p>
<p>The lights had been off, but when  Makoto switched them on, she'd recognized not only Motoki's usual  pair of loafers, but another with green stripes... ah, the twin  turtle otaku. Makoto smiled a little. <em>Well, good to know he  brought company over while I was out of town. Wouldn't want him to  be withdrawn into his shell all alone or anything. Though my  services hadn't been needed after all, so I got shipped back on the  express way...</em> Makoto chuckled  to herself, remembering the fluster of the client who had apologized  profusely for calling her over for nothing, insisting that they go  out for an early dinner at the very least before she went back.  Makoto hung up her coat and walked over to check that the nearest  plant had been watered. It had. That settled, she wandered  over to the bedroom, where she heard very hurried rustling. Curious,  she opened the door.</p>
<p>Well, would have if it wasn't locked.</p>
<p>Makoto knocked. The rustling froze  instantly, as if by magic. “Motoki?”</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>“I know you're there- I saw the  shoes you know.”</p>
<p>A flustered reply. “Ah, hold on, I  um... I'm changing!”</p>
<p>Makoto rolled her eyes. “Whatever.  You don't have to rush so much then, geez. It's just me.” <em>Why  does he lock the door? It's not like I've never...</em></p>
<p>Makoto shook her  head as she casually watered the hallway plant using the nearby glass  pitcher.</p>
<p>She winced as she  heard the closet door almost slam shut. <em>Did he have a bad day  with the customers or something?</em></p>
<p>And then the door  was open, and she was looking at a husband who looked like a mini  tornado had hit him. His hair was a mess- okay that wasn't <em>so </em>much of a difference- his shirt was askew... and... he had  forgotten to zip up.</p>
<p>Makoto rolled her  eyes, giving him the customary hug she always did when she came home  (or when Motoki arrived home after her). Motoki's hands on her back  felt... oddly clammy.</p>
<p>“Hey, are you  all right?”</p>
<p>Motoki's body  froze as Makoto held him at half an arm's length. He tried to laugh  nervously. “O-of course I am! Why wouldn't I be?”</p>
<p>Makoto traced the  base of his neck from behind. She looked down to hide her smile as  she closed her eyes. “Motoki...”</p>
<p>“Eh? What?  What is it?”</p>
<p>She flicked the  little bit of evidence she had uncovered. “You put on your shirt  inside out.”</p>
<p>As Motoki tried to  chase his own tail to find the telltale tag, Makoto patted his chest  in hopeless reassurance and moved past him in his distraction.</p>
<p>“W-wait, what  are you doing?”</p>
<p>Makoto ignored  him, looking around at their room. It was a complete mess. She  sighed. She <em>really</em> had to make use of her cleaning instincts  when living with Motoki... turtle merchandise everywhere, the bed  messed up since she made it this morning, and in the corner of her  eye, she noticed several balled up tissues.</p>
<p>She turned back  around. “Are you sick? Your hands did feel clammy...”</p>
<p>Motoki flushed and  looked away, hiding the incriminating hands behind his back. “Ah,  ah, no, I'm fine. Really. Have you eaten dinner yet?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, actually,  I did. And...” she took another sweeping survey of the room.  “Where's your friend? I saw his shoes in the front too.”</p>
<p>Motoki had a  shell-shocked expression on his face, almost... <em>like a child  trying to hide a stray pet in his room...</em> “Uhm... uhm... He's  in the bathroom!”</p>
<p>Makoto frowned. <em>He's acting </em>way<em> too weird. Even for him. </em>She glanced  behind his shoulder, and noticed what she had coming to the room.  “The bathroom light isn't on. Nor... is the door even closed... I  didn't see anyone there before, Motoki... What's going on?”</p>
<p>Motoki seemed to  be permanently shell-shocked, at least for tonight. “Well... I...  um... that is... you see... AH! What are you doing!”</p>
<p>Makoto had reached  for the closet door. “You dumb-bum. I'm getting new clothes so I  can change out of this after my shower- I've been wearing it all day.   You can go on playing hide-and-go-seek with your fri-” She  stopped, looking at the closet's contents in confusion, shock, and  whatever one might normally call that feeling.</p>
<p>“What the he...?”</p>
<p>Or you could go that way.</p>
<p>Makoto stared into those terrified,  dark, beady eyes. Eyes that looked back at her whilst the body only  wore a shirt and briefs, the pants balled up in front of privates.</p>
<p>Makoto stared.</p>
<p>The 'friend' hiccuped.</p>
<p>-.-.-.- Wednesday Morning -.-.-.-</p>
<p><em>The number you have dialed is  currently unavailable. Please hang-</em></p>
<p>Rei hung up the  phone. Apparently a bit too vehemently, because the boy who had been  trying to 'nonchalantly' pass by jumped clear off the ground.</p>
<p>She glared at her  closest target.</p>
<p>He cowered in on  himself, squinting up through a cocoon of limbs.</p>
<p>Rei rolled her  eyes. “Kentaro!”</p>
<p>Kentaro squeaked  and fumbled to straighten up military style, excluding the salute.  “Y-Yes, Rei-sama!”</p>
<p>“Have you done  your morning meditation yet?”</p>
<p>“N-n-no,  Rei-s-sama...!”</p>
<p>“Then go do it!”</p>
<p>“Y-yes,  Rei-sama!” He bowed quickly and tried to scamper off as if he was  just given an arbitrary delay of execution.</p>
<p>Rei sighed.  Softer, she called, “Kentaro.”</p>
<p>He squeaked again  and stopped. “Y-yes, Rei-sama?”</p>
<p>She put a hand to  her forehead as she walked past Kentaro to get to her room. She  ruffled his hair in passing with her other hand. “Concentrate on  meditating and calm down.”</p>
<p>“Y-yes...  Rei-sama.” Kentaro took large gulps of air as if this would help  the process. However, it was likely the act of Rei closing her  bedroom door behind her that really allowed Kentaro to relax.</p>
<p>Rei came out,  dressed to leave, to find Sakura and another one of the students  talking in whispers as one fed the crows and the other swept the  front walk. Before they had a chance to notice her presence, Rei  caught the lesser student informing Sakura, “Rei-sama is in one of  her moods again. I wonder what got up her-”</p>
<p>“Ryou!”</p>
<p>The speaker  instantly silenced himself and stood up straight, as did Sakura,  albeit more calmly.</p>
<p>Rei mumbled under  her breath a curse of some sort or whatever. “Aren't you supposed  to be on duty at the store? With Kenji?”</p>
<p>Ryou stiffened.  “Uh... you see... that...”</p>
<p>Rei rolled her  eyes again, not even looking at the boy anymore. “If you intend to  get to it, then get to it already.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Rei-sama.”   Ryou bowed and quickly scooted off.</p>
<p>Sakura hesitated,  as Rei never made eye contact with her and had yet to address her.  But... her worry overrode her 'common sense'. “Rei-sama? Are you  all right?”</p>
<p>Rei blinked back  into focus and sighed, looking at the girl. “Just annoyed, that's  all. Maybe a bit worried. I'll never be able to leave this place if  you guys can't measure up.”</p>
<p>Sakura bowed her  head with a small smile, knowing that her own level of dedication put  her in a better light than the boys. a.k.a. She could talk in a  non-martial way with Rei and not be chastised for it. “Are you  planning on going anywhere, Rei-sama?”</p>
<p>Rei scratched the  back of her head, letting out another tired sigh. “I was...  thinking of it. Like I always do.”</p>
<p>Sakura rocked back  on her heels, broom still in hand. “I can watch over the place for  you, Rei-sama.”</p>
<p>Rei blinked,  remembering why she was out here like this in the first place. “Ahm.   Well, for the time being, I'll just be gone for the day. Maybe not  even that. I'm still counting on you, alright, Sakura? Do <em>not</em> open my bedroom door this time.”</p>
<p>Sakura laughed  nervously. “Yes, Rei-sama. Of course.”</p>
<p>Rei smiled a  little. “I'll try to be in a better mood when I get back.”</p>
<p>Sakura, surprised  at first, gave her a smile in return. “They'll appreciate that.”</p>
<p>“They better,  for all I'm going to have to berate them even when I'm in a <em>good</em> mood...”</p>
<p>With that, Rei  waved and went down the walkway, passing a few school girls on the  way. She would have greeted them, but they might question why she  was leaving, and she didn't want to bother with that.</p>
<p>The train ride  passed by without much event, excluding giving up her seat for an old  lady who looked worn already from carrying her one large shopping  bag.</p>
<p>And then,  suddenly, there she was again, in front of the store. She looked  through the window, puzzled at the lack of light from within. She  then checked the town square clock, and realized she was very early.</p>
<p><em>Wait, aren't  they open in the mornings?</em></p>
<p>“Hino-chan! You  came to see me? I'm honored.”</p>
<p>Rei turned quickly  to find Eika standing before her... once again looking incredibly  incongruous, a grown woman innocently licking an ice cream cone. A  double-scoop one.</p>
<p>Eika noticed her  glance and grinned, licking her lips. “Mint chip and vanilla, yum.   I was just down the street checking the competition and couldn't  help myself.”</p>
<p>Rei blinked, not  quite understanding. “Since when did jewelry stores and ice  creameries compete?”</p>
<p>“Eh?” Eika  looked down at her indulgence, and then a light bulb came on. “Oh,  no, no, that's not what I meant. I saw that today was a free-cone  morning as I walked past the ice cream parlor, and I got one on my  way back from the other jewelry stores.” Eika extended the cone.  “It's good. Want to try?”</p>
<p>Rei flushed,  looking away. “That's alright. I don't really like sweet things.”</p>
<p>Eika shrugged,  linking together their arms on her ice-cream-less side. “If you  say so. Come on, what do you say we go walking? It's a beautiful  autumn day, you know.”</p>
<p>Rei looked down at  the linkage. She pointed at it with her free hand. “Must we?”</p>
<p>Eika frowned.  “You don't do this with your other girl friends?”</p>
<p>Misinterpreting,  a flustered Rei protested, “W-who has other girlfriends? <em>You're</em> not even my girlfriend. Wait- I don't even have <em>a</em> girlfriend. (Right now.)” She finished in a whisper.</p>
<p>Eika laughed,  tugging her along anyway. “That <em>does</em> have misleading  connotations, doesn't it? I apologize- I was referring to the normal  friends- that happen to be female- sort of 'girl friend'. Well,  don't you?”</p>
<p>Even more  embarrassed to find that she had protested even when wrong, Rei  looked away, muttering, “Not usually. And especially not  recently.”</p>
<p>“What a pity!  And this arm is so strong and caring too...”</p>
<p>Rei flushed and  looked around with darting eyes. “Stop saying such misleading  stuff! What if someone overhears us?”</p>
<p>“Who's going to  bother with that?”</p>
<p>And it was then,  that Rei noticed a fAmiliar car pass by.</p>
<p>-.-.-.- Friday  night's concert -.-.-.-</p>
<p>The crowds  screamed and raved for their favorite idol, the one for whom  passionate fires would never be entirely extinguished. If the  thousands of fans crowding the stadium, countless more watching from  their home TV, having been too late to purchase concert tickets, were  any testament to the success of the week's revival advertising,  tonight, it would come to a head.</p>
<p>And what an  anticipated head it was. That of their adored, precious,  more-than-just-any-idol-or-voice-or-face, Aino Minako.</p>
<p>The girl who loved  all, yet had no lovers.</p>
<p>The girl who all  loved, yet could never come near.</p>
<p>The girl who  seemed to perpetually represent the very essence of Love.</p>
<p>Aino Minako,  Goddess of Love.</p>
<p>The cheers were  deafening as the smoke effects began, signaling the long-anticipated  arrival of Her.</p>
<p>From the front  row, three young women, two less enthused (but still excited) men,  and four young students, made their own cheers known.</p>
<p>“Where's Rei!”  Usagi shouted, looking around, but especially at the empty seat  beside her.</p>
<p>Makoto shook her  head, yelling back, “I never saw her come in!”</p>
<p>Ami frowned,  watching as the crowds were silenced in waves to correspond with the  angelic voice that shone down among them from a height relative to  Heaven.</p>
<p>Silenced as well,  of course, in order to revere the angel herself, appearing out from  the clouds of smoke, her eyes flashing even brighter than her smile.</p>
<p>Ryou, now that  everyone else had quieted, said under his breath, “I can't believe  Rei-sama is missing this! Ah... Aino, aishiteruze!”</p>
<p>It was then that  Ami finally noticed something, during an absent look up at the  lighting arrangement. Her gasp of surprise went unheard.</p>
<p>-.-.-.- Thursday  Night -.-.-.-</p>
<p>“M-Makoto!”</p>
<p>She ignored the  call, shutting the apartment door behind her.</p>
<p>Talking it out in  length was an absurd thought. It was obvious, to her, what they'd  been doing. <em>I honestly hadn't thought that Motoki... that Motoki  would be the kind of person to cheat.</em></p>
<p>Makoto laughed  harshly at herself, bulldozing through the heavy double doors of the  apartment's front entrance.</p>
<p><em>Then  again, if I </em>had<em> known  Motoki better, if I'd known he wasn't really </em>that<em> interested... I just wouldn't have married him.</em></p>
<p>No one was coming  after her.</p>
<p>Well,  of course no one was coming after her. She distinctly remembered  telling Motoki to stay behind and let her cool off.</p>
<p>'Cool off' had been the wrong term to  use.</p>
<p>“I'm not mad,” she whispered to  herself, stopping under a tree. She touched the thick trunk,  bringing her forehead to touch it. “I'm not mad. It's not that.  It's just...”</p>
<p>Makoto laughed softly to herself as  she slumped down, first to her knees, then curled up, sitting  underneath the comforting presence of her favorite neighborhood park  oak tree.</p>
<p><em>I just... feel so... </em>stupid<em>.   It's not </em>that<em> hard to  tell, right? I should have been able to see something, anything,  right?</em></p>
<p>Motoki  had said, in the living room sitting next to his old friend turned  lover, “It... when it first happened... when I realized how I  felt... it was the night before the wedding. The bachelor party that  Mamoru-san had recalled from his abroad studies.”</p>
<p>Makoto bent down  her head, hugging her knees. <em>What the hell is up with that? If  both of us knew that we were destined to love others more than each  other, then why wasn't something said! Why... why did it have to  drag on this long...</em></p>
<p>She  hadn't confessed about her own feelings about 'a friend'. She  instead had asked how long they'd been seeing each other... like  this.</p>
<p><em>Off  and on... the whole time. </em>Makoto  repeatedly tried to ram her forehead between the gap of her knees,  with no real success. <em>Was that why he was so nervous  around me? Was he distracted around the customers when I was away,  not because he didn't know what to do (that couldn't have been it, I  drilled him into how to do everything at the start; when I'm there,  he does everything just fine), but because </em>he<em> was visiting whenever I wasn't there? Why didn't my customers say  anything about it?</em></p>
<p>A night sprinkler  started to drench her in cold water meant for the tree. But she  didn't want to move. She didn't know where to go.</p>
<p><em>The thing is...  I don't even know if I </em>deserve<em> to feel betrayed. My feelings  for Ami have gone on just as long, and when she visits...</em> A  horrendous bark of laughter ripped itself from Makoto's throat.  Lower even, as if the action had been a vain attempt to free her  heart from the confines of her body in the same breath. <em>I always  had Ami visit when Motoki was out for the night. The so-called  'guy's poker night' he'd been invited to, that I had insisted he at  least tried. Was that when the lies began? When we both waited  until the other was away to see the ones we really loved?</em></p>
<p>“Mako-chan...  is that you?”</p>
<p>Makoto looked up  and finally realized that tears were streAming down her cheeks.</p>
<p>-.-.-.- Wednesday  Night -.-.-.-</p>
<p><em>Calm down. </em>Her  leg fidgeted, and her eyes fidgeted watching her leg fidget.</p>
<p><em>I said calm  down!</em> She thrust both hands over the offending leg, which  stopped it, until the other leg started to fidget.</p>
<p>She sighed warily,  giving up for the sake of not wasting her energy on trying in vain to  conserve said energy. “Are we there yet?”</p>
<p>Obviously not. If  they had arrived the taxi would have stopped already.</p>
<p>“It's two blocks  more, ma'am.”</p>
<p>Rei tsk'ed and  propped her elbow on the door, watching the buildings meticulously  roll on by.</p>
<p><em>Why didn't I  take a taxi that first time? I would have been fine the whole way  through straight up to my doorstep. I didn't need to be driven by  Eika.</em></p>
<p>“Ma'am?”</p>
<p>Rei blinked.  Sometime in the period it had taken for her to conjure that thought  and more, they'd arrived. She quickly paid the driver and got out.</p>
<p>Rei sucked in a  soft, careful breath, looking up at the awe inspiring structure.</p>
<p>She then shook her  head vigorously. <em>This is no time to be admiring it! I did that  before already!</em></p>
<p>The fire priestess  pounded up the steps, not thinking to take the elevator for some  absurdly nervous reason, knowing that she wouldn't encounter guards  until she'd reached <em>her</em> floor. Which made things easy.</p>
<p>“Halt! State  your name and business!”</p>
<p>Rei rolled her  eyes. <em>What is this- medieval ages?</em></p>
<p>She pulled out her  pass, though she wasn't sure if it worked for the hotel authority.  “Hino Rei. A close friend of Minako's. She... I'm here to see  her.”<br />
  “About what?”</p>
<p><em>None of your  beeswax, bub.</em></p>
<p>“Visiting. Plain  and simple. Excuse me if I haven't seen her for more than <em>two </em>years and want to just talk.” <em>That's not why I'm coming  tonight, but it's close enough.</em></p>
<p>The bulky man  called over an associate. Rei stood there, defiantly. Would they  try to kick her out? Forbid her from seeing the idol? What?</p>
<p>The backup  demanded that she hand over her pass. Confused, but obedient, Rei  did just so.</p>
<p>And was  immediately lifted off the ground.</p>
<p>By her cheeks no  less.</p>
<p>Being pulled  apart, at the seams, Rei imagined.</p>
<p>“Wahl uh hehl oo  yoo ihn yooe ooin! (What the hell do you think you're doing!)”</p>
<p>The associate  looked up, looked over, then looked down. Then he nodded.</p>
<p>Rei was released  and the pass handed back to her. Rubbing her sore cheeks, she  guessed that that was what Minako had <em>really</em> meant by having a  secure pass. The men started to walk away, and Rei followed them.</p>
<p>They stopped in  front of a door. One of the men knocked loudly. “Aino-san,  Hino-san is here to see you.”<br />
  There was nothing from beyond the  door.</p>
<p>The man knocked  again, even louder. “Aino-san, are you there?”</p>
<p><em>Well it </em>is<em> a bit late, I suppose, but not </em>that<em> late...</em></p>
<p>There was a  responding knock on the other side. “I was in the shower. Is  there something wrong?”</p>
<p>Rei stepped up.  “Minako, I want to talk to you.” <em>Maybe I should have said  that in a more friendly manner.</em></p>
<p>It was silent for  a moment. Then, “Suoh, Takashi, return to your stations.”</p>
<p>“Aino-san...?”</p>
<p>“It's all  right.”</p>
<p>The two guards  hesitated a moment, before nodding and making their departure.</p>
<p>Rei stared at the  door. “They're gone. Aren't you going to let me in?”</p>
<p>“Why are you  here?”</p>
<p>Rei's eyebrow  twitched. “I wanted to see you!”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p><em>I really don't  like how detached that sounds...</em></p>
<p>“Because I want  to! Unless...” Rei paused. No, even if it <em>wasn't</em> true, she  would still want to know why. “Monday night. Did you visit the  shrine after I left with Eika?”</p>
<p>“How is Eika-san  doing?”</p>
<p>Rei growled  softly, leaning against the door. Fine, if Minako wouldn't let her  in (which was senseless, considering she had done nothing that should  offend the idol), Rei would just make do with talking through a door.   At least Minako was talking to her. “Don't change the subject.  She's fine, last I saw. Now were you there?”</p>
<p>“What makes you  think I was?”</p>
<p>Rei counted it off  her fingers. “I saw your shadow, your hair, <em>and</em> your car  drive off.”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>“You and  Eika-san are hitting it off rather well, aren't you?”</p>
<p>Rei stopped.  “What the heck does <em>that</em> have to do with anything?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn't want  to get in the way of fateful encounters.”</p>
<p>Rei seriously  frowned now. Just <em>what</em> was she trying to imply? “Minako...”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Just what are  you trying to tell me?”</p>
<p>Rei could almost  see Minako's smile through the door.</p>
<p>“If you want  to... go out with Eika-san... you don't have to wait until after I  leave Saturday, you know.”</p>
<p>Rei's heart  stopped.</p>
<p>Neither of them  were smiling happy smiles.</p>
<p>-.-.-.-.- Friday  Night -.-.-.-</p>
<p>“We can't do  this, it's so... it goes against everything I believe in.”</p>
<p>“Does it? But  you've done this before, haven't you? I know you have.”</p>
<p>Rei shook her head  vehemently. “Not like this. Not to get to her. Not...”</p>
<p>She felt a  caressing hand on her ear, a warm breath on the other, and so she  jerked forward, being trapped by every other side. “It'll be over  before you know it.”</p>
<p>“I still... does  it have to be this way?”</p>
<p>“I'm only here  to help you achieve what you want to achieve, the likes of which I  have honestly never seen before. It's a good thought, I assure you,  but you have to be willing to make sacrifices.”</p>
<p>“I was! But...  but this...”</p>
<p>“What are you  afraid of? Don't you want to let her know?”</p>
<p>“Of course I do!   But... but... If this goes wrong, I might... I really might never  see her again!”</p>
<p>“Nothing will be  gained from being too afraid to earn what you deserve.”</p>
<p>Rei shook her  head. “There has to be another way.”</p>
<p>“They refused  you once. She didn't come to you. So you have to go to her. Right  now.”</p>
<p>“Now! She's on  stage!”</p>
<p>“Where better to  confess than in front of millions?”</p>
<p>“... You aren't  serious are you?”</p>
<p>Eika sighed  softly, patting Rei's back before stepping away to lean against the  railing beside the younger. “Too dramatic for you?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Did you <em>just</em> get that?”</p>
<p>Rei glared as Eika  chuckled. “But it would solve all your problems at once.”</p>
<p>Rei frowned.  Grudgingly, she demanded, “Explain.”</p>
<p>Eika's eyes were  closed, listening to the soft melody of Minako's current song. “You  wouldn't do this if you wanted to be involved with me.”</p>
<p>“I would be  doing only <em>because</em> I'm involved- because you told me to!”</p>
<p>Eika placed a  gentle finger on the tip of Rei's nose. “I meant <em>intimately</em> involved. You're doing this for her, after all.”</p>
<p>Rei bowed her  head. “I'm not doing it.”</p>
<p>“What would you  rather do then? We both know that if you don't do <em>something</em>,  she <em>will</em> leave tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p>Rei bit her lip.  “The dressing room.”</p>
<p>“What about it?”</p>
<p>“She'll return  there afterwards anyway, right? So I'll just talk to her in the  dressing room.”</p>
<p>“The same guards  that refused you earlier will still be there. They don't want bombs,  much less fanatics, to sneak into that very place, for that very  reason, you know. Are you going to beat them into letting you?  Minako won't be allowed into the dresser room if the hall leading to  it is littered with the bodies of her security personnel.”</p>
<p>“... And your  idea is any less suspicious!”</p>
<p>“How in the  world is it suspicious?”</p>
<p>Rei's cheeks  finally gave in and betrayed her deep blush. “It just is! It's  stupid too.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Really.”</p>
<p>Eika shrugged  offhandedly, and then continued the list she had started earlier.  “If you do it right, you may cinch thousands of fans for both her  and you.”</p>
<p>“I don't <em>want</em> fans! And people... even if she were to accept... me... it wouldn't  even need extra paparazzi- it's <em>already</em> being televised  worldwide! Her... her career could <em>end</em> as we all know it!”</p>
<p>“Didn't you want  that? Didn't you want her to not use her work as an excuse anymore?  For her to be able to be with you, live with you, here?”</p>
<p>“But this...  this... my father wouldn't be happy about the publicity either!”</p>
<p>Eika frowned. She  straightened, signaling Rei to do the same and face her. “Rei...  If she returned your feelings in the first place... location of  confession aside... don't you think she would help you through the  publicity stunts? She's been doing this a long time... and she'll  have a reason to cooperate.”</p>
<p>Rei glowered. “On  the other side, I don't want people all over the world to be able to  recognize me as the woman Aino Minako rejected at her hometown  concert.”</p>
<p>“You know even  better than I do that if something like that were to happen, you  wouldn't be the first- you would be forgotten easily by the masses.”</p>
<p>“My father won't  forget. My friends won't forget.”</p>
<p>“Why haven't you  told them about your feelings before? Your father is your father- if  you know, he deserves to know. It's not as if you're a child anymore  either. And if they're really your friends, not only would they  understand, but don't you believe that they, on some level, already  know?”</p>
<p>Rei flinched at  the idea, flashbacks of all the mishaps and near-chances she had had  in the past, some grazing far too close for comfort. She hadn't  always been alone with her either, those times.</p>
<p>Eika placed a  light but firm hand on Rei's shoulder. “Isn't it about time that  you just believed in yourself and in the future? Even if you weren't  in love with someone as famous as Minako, you would still have to  deal with this sort of possibility with any love you have. You're  famous too, don't forget. You just have to get used to it, and go  with the flow.”</p>
<p>“What flow?”  Rei planted her feet for emphasis.</p>
<p>Eika reached up  and tucked a strand of hair behind Rei's ear. “The flow of living  in the moment. You told me before that you used to be afraid of the  past's consequences didn't you? But you learned to override that.  Override your fears again. Live and love in the here and now, and  laugh at yourself once its all over.”</p>
<p>Rei hesitated,  looking over at the stage. “I don't know... it still...”</p>
<p>“If I told you  that Minako would die if you weren't on that stage by the time her  last encore draws to a close... would you go?”</p>
<p>Rei whipped her  head around. “What are you talking about! Why would she...?  What do you know?”<br />
  <em>I haven't gotten any readings from the  fire about that...</em></p>
<p>Eika  smiled. “You'll know once it happens. But only you can change  history tonight.”</p>
<p>“Change...  history?”</p>
<p>Eika nodded. “The  history that will come to be when Aino Minako is either saved or  neglected by her protector.”</p>
<p>Rei frowned. “The  guards...”</p>
<p>“They'll never  get there on time to stop it, let alone detect it. That's why you  have to be <em>on </em>stage, near her.”</p>
<p>Her eyebrows  narrowed. “<em>You</em> aren't planning to do something, are you?”</p>
<p>“Go on stage?  Of course not, I wouldn't dare. I have no reason to.”</p>
<p>Rei advanced on  that all-too-innocent look of hers. “You also wouldn't <em>dare</em> to attack Minako, right? You have no <em>reason</em> to, <em>right</em>?”</p>
<p>Eika simply  smiled. “Come now Rei. Sugao is my uncle. And Minako is popular.   These sorts of things happen all the time.”</p>
<p>Rei didn't believe  it. “Would someone really try to hurt Minako tonight?”</p>
<p>“She should have  someone near her with quick reflexes just in case.”</p>
<p>Rei glared.</p>
<p>“And it wouldn't  do for any normal civilian to be there on call to save her, now would  it?”</p>
<p>Rei glared as hard  as she could.</p>
<p>Eika smiled at  her, holding up a large shopping bag. “Well?”</p>
<p>The glare was no  good. She dropped it for the sake of a throaty snarl. “What am I  going to do if it goes wrong?”</p>
<p>Eika smiled.  “Smile and sing in lament.”</p>
<p>Rei snatched the  bag from her hands, looking inside. Her face fell. More then it had  already been. “You have <em>got</em> to be kidding me.”</p>
<p>“You should know  by now, Hino-chan,” Eika grinned, “My jokes never last this  long.”</p>
<p>Rei muttered as  she turned on her heel and started to walk away, “I hate you.”</p>
<p>Eika smiled  triumphantly at that. “Glad to hear it.”</p>
<p>Rei lost herself  in the crowd. Then, finding the bathroom, she went in, looking to  make sure no one was there- somehow, nobody was, all eyes glued to  the idol, bladders on hold. Rei looked at the bag's contents again  once she had locked herself into a stall.</p>
<p>She sighed. “This  better work. Or else <em>someone's</em> hide is going to be had  tonight.”</p>
<p>-.-.-.- Thursday  Night -.-.-.-</p>
<p>Tears blurred her  vision, but she could still make out the two fAmiliar figures.  Rushing towards her.</p>
<p>“Mako-chan!”</p>
<p>“Are you  alright? What happened?”</p>
<p>Makoto tried to  smile, the effort causing twin teardrops to spill down her cheeks.  “I...” She trailed off, not knowing what to say. Was she  alright? Would she be all right? Or...</p>
<p>Ami placed an arm  around her back. “Let's get you somewhere warm first. You'll get  sick at this rate, Mako-chan!”</p>
<p>Minako nodded,  taking up Makoto's other side. “Come on. Isn't your home near  here? We could-”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>The two girls  stopped, and looked at Makoto. “Please... not tonight... I  can't...”</p>
<p>Ami paused.  “Makoto, can you walk?”</p>
<p>Makoto nodded  limply, almost like, she thought she could, but if tested, she would  surely fail. Minako saw the doctor's conclusion as well. With a nod  to Ami, they hoisted her up on either side.</p>
<p>Minako offered,  “Come on. If not your place, then at least let's go to the car. I  think I have a spare blanket in there.”</p>
<p>Makoto, voice  distant and not at all like it usually was, whispered, “Why are  you... two here... anyway?”</p>
<p>The two exchanged  glances. Ami answered, “Usagi invited us all over for a house  visit today. We heard you had come back early so we thought we would  pick you up...”</p>
<p>Makoto was like a toddler again,  stumbling and almost tripping every so often. She didn't seem to be  injured, so why...?</p>
<p>They reached the car. Minako opened  the door and Ami helped Makoto sit on the edge, her feet touching the  cement, while the former fished out the aforementioned blanket.  Makoto's eyes did not refocus even with the added warmth. But then,  the reason why she had allowed herself to get soaked in the first  place had had nothing to do with the temperature. Still, she hugged  the ends of the blanket after it was draped over her back.</p>
<p>Minako watched her a moment, before  deciding. “We'll go to Usagi's. Ami, get in.”</p>
<p>Makoto lifelessly shifted her feet so  that she was fully inside the car, and Ami carefully closed the door  for her. Going around to the other side, Ami did not hesitate before  she slipped into the back rather than the passenger seat. Minako  started the car and they were on their way.</p>
<p>“Mako-chan...” Ami whispered,  cringing as a more stable stream of tears started to flow down the  woman's smooth cheeks. “What happened? Did Motoki-san-”</p>
<p>Ami stopped as Makoto bit her lower  lip, her whole face contorted to have a proper soul-searing crying  fit. Ami, her mind not even reaching what had happened that weekend,  quickly reached over to embrace her friend. And then the crying  began in full.</p>
<p>After several long minutes, the crying  completely subsided, which was fortunate, since they had arrived at  their destination.</p>
<p>Makoto took a handful of deep, calming  breaths, before smiling up at Ami. “I... I feel better now, thank  you.”</p>
<p>Ami shook her head. “Are you really  all right?”</p>
<p>Makoto nodded and then reached for the  door. “I can walk by myself, promise.”</p>
<p>And she did. Tiredly, but by herself.   And she was resolved to do it, as if that was the only way left for  her. Minako and Ami kept to her like gloves to hands the whole way  to the door though. And when they arrived, they didn't even have to  knock before the door flew open, an energetic Usagi welcoming them  in. “You came! Come in, come in! I just- Mako-chan!” She had  just gotten her first good look at Makoto's face as it came under the  light. “You were in town? No, wait. What's wrong? What  happened?”</p>
<p>Makoto smiled weakly at her. “I'll...  I'll tell all of you... at once... Where's Rei?”</p>
<p>Usagi's face was downcast even as she  went through the motions of ushering them in, closing the door behind  them. “She just called and said a student of hers had taken on  something that she was supposed to do herself and ended up bungling  it. She can't afford to come over tonight. Mama and Papa and Shingo  are out watching the newest thriller. I told them I didn't need to  be scared for nothing, so I'd stay home. Ah, I'll go get some, um,  hot cocoa, yeah! Just sit down in the living room, okay?”</p>
<p>They did as asked, Makoto waiting  until Usagi returned before saying anything.</p>
<p>She took a sip of the cocoa once it  was offered to her, and smiled. “It's delicious, Usagi.”</p>
<p>Usagi rubbed the back of her head  sheepishly. “It's just instant mix, Mako-chan...”</p>
<p>Makoto shook her head. “I still  remember the days when you burned the simplest things. You've really  really improved since then. You should be proud.”</p>
<p>Usagi bowed her head, and they lay in  wait.</p>
<p>Makoto lowered her mug, looking down  at the ripples the motion had made.</p>
<p>At long last, she began.</p>
<p>“I think... no, I know... my  marriage is officially over as I knew it.”</p>
<p>-.-.-.- Friday Night -.-.-.-</p>
<p>Minako let out a quiet, shuddering  sigh as the music heightened, overwhelming any small sound she might  make in the mean time.</p>
<p><em>Just one more song...</em></p>
<p>She  looked out into the crowd, and somehow, wasn't really surprised that  Rei hadn't taken up her seat in the last five minutes since her last  check. Still... She looked up at her countless fans, and  smiled brightly.</p>
<p><em>For them. For all of them. Not  just one person.</em></p>
<p>The  last song in her planned line up was done before she could really  cope with it. It was sink or swim now. She... if she was going to  do anything, now was the time. She looked over to the place offstage  where her manager was. Behind her back, she gave him the signal.  She wanted to do it. Sugao nodded and called up the person in charge  of the music accordingly.</p>
<p>Then, with one  final long breath, she announced, “Thank you for coming to support  me today, and all the time before now. I hope... I hope you'll  continue to support me in the future as well. This last song... I've  never publicized, because, well, I can't take the credit for it. But  it was written and last sung for me by the biggest fan of mine that I  happen to know very well. So this is a tribute to her, and her song,  'Hoshi Furu Yoake'.”</p>
<p>Minako  listened to the music beginning, closing her eyes to properly  get a feel for the music. There would be no high paced choreographed  dancing to go with this song. It wasn't how <em>she</em> had sung it, so Minako wouldn't either.</p>
<p align="center"><em>With  the window left open, I gazed at-</em></p>
<p><strong>“Hold  up just one minute there!”</strong></p>
<p>Minako  stopped abruptly, just as startled as the crowds were. When the idol  glanced at Sugao however, he was smiling, though the music had  stopped like a record player being interrupted at just the right  instant.</p>
<p>And  like magic, She appeared, enter stage left.</p>
<p>Minako  had her back to a third of her live concert visitors, but she didn't  care. What she cared about was the entity that was now walking in to  steal her stage.</p>
<p>The  woman smirked, which was incredibly fitting with her outfit, which  was best described as an earthly devil of fire in comparison to  Minako's angel-on-earth look. The details were unimportant to anyone  who wasn't seeing it for themselves. For those that did, no words  were necessary. By the time she had stepped side by side, everyone  was secretly convinced that they went hand in hand, despite the  public stereotype that angels and devils were at odds.</p>
<p>These  two were a whole other category by themselves.</p>
<p>Still  not used to the microphone being so close, Rei's soft voice boomed, <strong>“You didn't think I'd really let you sing <em>my</em> song when I'm still around, do you?”</strong></p>
<p>Minako  stared at her still, the crowds somehow having faded away into  oblivion. Only the person in front of her mattered. She whispered,  “Why... why are you here?”</p>
<p>Rei winked on the side that was away from the cameras. “Can't a  girl just sing a song with her friend?”</p>
<p>Minako stared.</p>
<p>And stared.</p>
<p>Rei patiently smiled at her. That was the only way it could work  after all.</p>
<p>And finally, Minako cracked, letting out a long, gentle laughter,  that captured another thousand hearts that would later see a video of  this from their zealous friends.</p>
<p>Wiping tears of unrelenting joy in her eyes, she whispered, “What  am I doing, protesting? It's your song for a reason. I would have  it no other way than to sing it with you.”</p>
<p>Rei nodded, smiling. “That's what I thought.”</p>
<p>She then took a step back as the song began again.</p>
<p>Her body was facing their audience, but it was clear that her heart  and attention were on one person, and one person only.</p>
<p>And Minako's diehard fans, those who truly believed in love the way  Minako did, and had been disheartened at all her rejections of love  in the past six years...</p>
<p>... they didn't mind at all.</p>
<p>After all, now they knew the reason <em>why</em> Minako had rejected  them all.</p>
<p>The answer was right there in her eyes as she smiled a new smile for  her fans to at last see. A smile that wasn't directed at a  generalization.</p>
<p>That reason, that answer, and that smile, were more than enough for  them.</p>
<p>-.-.-.- Thursday Night -.-.-.-</p>
<p>Makoto sipped quietly from her cold mug. She had just finished  relating all the details that she knew. And because these were her  comrade-at-arms, the same ones she had died and been reborn alongside  so long ago, she told them her feelings that went with them. After  all, all of them had heard loud and clear her own feelings for Ami,  including the intended.</p>
<p>The room was silent, still digesting everything.</p>
<p>The clock chimed the hour.</p>
<p>Usagi licked her lips, not being inconsiderate enough to <em>not</em> take this seriously. It was still too fresh a wound to laugh about.  “Did he say what he wanted to do?” Usagi suddenly shook her  head. “No, first, there's something more important to ask. Do <em>you</em> know what you want to do now?”</p>
<p>During the retelling, a few more tears had been squeezed out, but  she was in general steady now. Makoto leaned her head over the back  of the couch, a small smile touching her lips. “I think the  problem was that it was kept a secret. Motoki... he's still my  partner. I <em>want</em> to continue working for him at the shop. I  still... love (suki) him... knowing that he... he didn't love (ai)  me... I don't know... I hate to say it... but I actually feel a  bit... relieved, you know? Like... if he was guilty all this time, I  just have to tell him my side... and then we'll be even. Right?”</p>
<p>Ami frowned. “But... But Mako-chan... we never...”</p>
<p>“The thought was there.” Makoto closed her eyes, the smile  growing, despite its sad nature. “The thought was <em>firmly</em> there, in my mind. Possibly even more than his is, even now.   That's enough to me. I'm sorry.”</p>
<p>Ami shook her head. “You don't need to be sorry, Mako-chan.”</p>
<p>Minako licked her lips, knowing the response required delicacy, but  knowing asking the important questions were still needed.  “Mako-chan... will you keep living with him? Now that you know?”</p>
<p>Makoto snorted softly, the smile growing. “If we do, it'll be  after some seriously long winded conversation, involving a sign on  the door when it's not a good idea to barge on in.”</p>
<p>Minako blinked. “You... other than that, you don't mind that  he's... you know... into guys?”</p>
<p>Makoto opened her eyes just a little bit, just enough to look at  Minako alone. “Did you not catch the part where I'm still very  much in love with Ami here? I'm hardly in position to start being  bigoted.”</p>
<p>Minako bowed her head, berating herself for not having realized  that.</p>
<p>Usagi picked up the slack. “Is that your plan then? To just talk  it out and have nothing change?”</p>
<p>Makoto now turned to her. “Everything has changed. That matters.   I'm not about to revoke my marriage license or lose a partner in  this business when I haven't approved anyone else for longer than  three months. Nor am I about to kick him out, or kick myself out,  since really, like I said, we are equally in the wrong- he just got  caught... first. Why should either of us be any more punished than  how much we already have been? That won't make anyone happy.”</p>
<p>Ami smiled uncertainly. “Are you sure you can be happy with this  arrangement?”</p>
<p>Makoto hesitated, looking down. After a long pause, she looked up  at her last, most important, friend.</p>
<p>And smiled.</p>
<p>“This is the way I am- stubborn and proud of it. Motoki has  always been there when I come back from work, even if that work was  once Senshi duty. If I'm not what he really wants, I won't get in  the way of that. Not anymore. As long as he doesn't mind staying...  staying...” Makoto stopped, scrunching her eyebrows in thought.  Finding the word, she smiled brighter, “As long as he stays my  irreplaceable friend. Like all of you.”</p>
<p>An appreciative silence followed.</p>
<p>-.-.-.- Friday Night -.-.-.-.-</p>
<p align="center"><em>The moon glows in the  sky, guiding my wandering dreams<br />
  I can't sleep, shined upon by all  the stardust</em></p>
<p>Rei smiled as she managed  to pass by Minako yet again, their routine only requiring simple  walking (an art form to many practiced ladies) and heart-rendering  looks at each other, caught for the big screen by cameras at every  angle imaginable. There was something about the way Minako had  looked at her from the moment she had taken up the stage. Something  that Eika knew would be there, which was why she was goaded into  seeing it for herself.</p>
<p align="center"><em>Honestly, in my warm  heart I want to wait for dawn, but<br />
  I have no choice but to proceed  from here with my own feet</em></p>
<p>Minako shook her head  softly even as she sang the words. She had felt alone for fourteen  years, half filled for one special year, and on a downward spiral for  the next six. But now, now she was most certainly not alone. Even  if it was just for a single song's length.</p>
<p>Oh how she prayed time  would stop for them.</p>
<p align="center"><em>That time, you gave to  me the strength to go through life alone<br />
  Everything came from your  smile.</em></p>
<p>Rei inwardly laughed at the  lines she had sung so long ago. That time, so long ago, she hadn't  ever recalled Minako smiling. But there was something about her  eyes... was it just her eyes? Yes... yes it was. She looked across  the way at those eyes again. The eyes that once longed to smile.</p>
<p>Smile like they were now.</p>
<p align="center"><em>If the stars shine  through the darkness and answer my prayer </em></p>
<p>Minako  looked over to see if Rei would sing the very last line with her, but  was startled to find no one standing there. There hadn't even been a  hurried “Look out!” before she felt a solid force tackling her to  the ground. Oddly, the force that had tackled her also prevented her  from getting hurt in the fall, using its own body as a buffer.</p>
<p>And  that was when she saw more than heard the loud <strong>kerthunk</strong> that  broke a plank of the stage floor in half (though not completely).</p>
<p>“Minako,  are you alright?”</p>
<p>Minako  stared at the place that she had been standing just seconds before,  and then down at her savior.</p>
<p>She  smiled. “I told you I would need Mars Reiko-san to save me. And  I'm thankful for it. I'm fine.”</p>
<p>Rei  stared at her, and then shook her head, slipping out from under  Minako like she realized she could have all those times before but  didn't. “Any self-deserving privately-trained fan would have done  the same. For you.”</p>
<p>Minako  saw the guards rushing up, and quickly stood up to stop them. While  staring at the box, she had managed to recognize the logo poking out  from the side, half hidden by the floor. “It's all right. I think  I know what it is.”</p>
<p>Rei  slowly stood up, not realizing that they were essentially putting on  an unrehearsed skit for the crowd, who had refrained from cheering so  that they could hear what was being said. “You do?”</p>
<p>Minako  nodded, who gestured for Rei to follow her in going over and bending  down next to the package that had fallen.</p>
<p>Rei  muttered, “It smells of gunpowder. The blast that made it come  down must have been that. Or else...”</p>
<p>Minako  shook her head, smiling. “Look, see, it's addressed to us. Don't  you recognize that handwriting?”</p>
<p>Rei  squinted, and then jolted her head up, an intelligible curse on her  lips. Minako quickly put a finger to the woman's lips, along with a  private smile. “You think it's safe to let the audience see?”</p>
<p>At  that, Rei flushed profusely, something that many a otaku found  entirely adorable. But she muttered softly, “If it landed on  stage, I would think <em>someone</em> thought it appropriate for an  audience.”</p>
<p>Minako  smiled and nodded. She waved over one of her most trusted cameramen  who had been laying in wait near Sugao, who was startled and yet at  the same time unsurprised. The things that man denied about not  knowing...</p>
<p>And  with that, Minako and Rei pulled the box out of the broken plank and  set it down on a clear plank nearby, rearranging themselves so that  the cameraman's body was facing the box, and the two young women were  crouching to his left and right.</p>
<p>They  opened the lid together.</p>
<p>And  found a note, which they had to twist their heads to read properly,  though the cameraman had the perfect view of it.</p>
<p>Rei  knew she didn't have to read it aloud, but she did anyway, lost in  the moment. “'I told you I'd give you a signal. Here it is: Tell  her. Now. (And then flip the page for Minako-chan)'”</p>
<p>Rei  looked up at Minako.</p>
<p>Who  smiled softly. “You apparently go first. Tell me what Rei? I'm  assuming, that is, that it's referring to me.”</p>
<p>Rei  smiled shyly. “It is.” Nervously, she reorganized her legs so  that she was sitting in the traditional (stiff until it hurts)  crouched position.</p>
<p>She  looked very odd like that, considering what she was wearing.</p>
<p>But  Minako nevertheless unconsciously mirrored her.</p>
<p>Rei  took a deep breath.</p>
<p>And  exhaled.</p>
<p>She  frowned.</p>
<p><em>Why  can't I start? She went over with me the basics that I needed to get  out from the get go... so why...?</em></p>
<p>“Rei?”</p>
<p>Rei  shook her head, and looked directly into Minako's eyes.</p>
<p>And  remembered how she felt during all those dreams, all those mishaps...</p>
<p>During  every single second that Minako so much as crossed her mind.</p>
<p>She  smiled, and it left her mouth effortlessly. “Aishiteru, Minako.”</p>
<p>Minako  instantly bit her lip. But she was smiling. As if she had been  given a surprise she'd learned about beforehand. But what she  actually said was, “I'm not sure if I should say anything, in case  the next page tells me to do something different.”</p>
<p>Rei,  her part over, and largely uninterrupted by the massive crowds, which  was amazing in and of itself, peeked under the page, and then ripped  the top one off when she realized it was a cheap sticky note.</p>
<p>Rei  read again, “'Minako-chan, feel free to answer. Honestly. And  when I say honestly, I mean <em>anything</em> you feel up to.”</p>
<p>Minako  laughed into her microphone. Then, reaching up to push it farther  away from her mouth, she whispered, “If it says so, then I guess I  must. Rei-chan, could you do me a favor and lean over? I'm not sure  if this will work with you so far away.”</p>
<p>They  weren't sitting more than two feet away from each other, tops, but  Rei leaned over as she was bid, supporting herself over the open box  by two carefully placed hands on either side of the box, ruining the  cameraman's view of said box.</p>
<p>But  that didn't matter, because the normal straight-on angle camera  caught perfectly the moment when Minako leaned over, her hands  cupping Rei's jaw, and kissed the woman soundly, warmly, and as an  example to all unrequited-lovers preparing to confess in the near  future.</p>
<p>When  she leaned back five seconds later, her eyes were unbelievably  softened, as if all her years of living “in the real world” had  done nothing to kill her soul, which was shining brighter now than  ever before.</p>
<p>“I  love you too, Rei.”</p>
<p>And  with that, Minako took off her own note, and removed the  handle-attached top of the box. It was exactly as she had thought.</p>
<p>Two  perfectly pillowed platinum silver promise rings with ruby and topaz  stones embedded into them, run through with a metallic chain to form  necklaces.</p>
<p>The  final note, resting between the two cushioned rings, was read by  Minako.</p>
<p>“'Yay,  the hard part's over. Congratulations. This is my last present to  you both, so enjoy it, because it's free. Yes, free. I wish you the  best of luck. Cheers.'”</p>
<p>Minako  looked up at Rei, at the same time that Rei looked up at her. They  smiled away the shock. “I don't know if I'm ready to <em>marry</em> you, but...”</p>
<p>Rei  smiled, bending down to let up the ruby ringed necklace. Unclasping  it, she whispered, “The hard part is over. We'll worry about the  details later. Bend over.”</p>
<p>Minako  obediently did so, freeing the topaz ring while she waiting for Rei  to finish putting the first on her. When she was done, Minako  silently returned the favor.</p>
<p>They  looked at each other once it was done. They both quickly side  glanced at the crowd. And then without the slightest outward signal,  they both stood up.</p>
<p>Their  hands found each other's on the way, as they stepped forward, closer  to the crowds.</p>
<p>The  crowd was held breathless, expecting more even if they didn't know  what. Even the front row spectators didn't know what to say.</p>
<p>Minako  suddenly glanced at Rei with a frown. “Did I ever introduce your  full name?”</p>
<p>Rei  looked baffled, and then, as if a sudden dangerous idea had flown  into her head, she broke off her grip with Minako's hand, and took a  large step to the side.</p>
<p>She  then put her hands in front of her and bowed, the next words she  spoke making her out to be a man asking a woman's parents for their  blessing.</p>
<p>“My  name is Hino Rei, and I am an honest and hardworking young priestess  at the Hikawa Shrine. Those of you who know me but not from there,  likely have heard of the deeds I foresaw while meditating, and  prevented, such as the attempted assassination on the prime minister  sometime in the recent past.” She paused, as if trying to remember  a speech she had never written down. “I swear that as long as she  lets me, I will take even better care of her than I do myself. I  also swear to do the very best I can to make her happy- in a sensible  way- because that, not coincidentally, that is also what makes <em>me </em>happiest. It would make the both of us, I believe, truly happy  indeed if we were to gain your blessing before we embark on this  journey before us, a hopefully long but peaceful one, so...”</p>
<p>Rei  took a deep breath, her head having been slightly bowed in the whole  process, and looked up at the same time that her hands went behind  her back. Her whole body from her pose, to her unnerving stature,  and puppy eyes that totally superseded Minako's famous one, in  addition to a dazzling smile the likes of which have never before  been seen, on TV or elsewhere, all of it went into her childish,  unbelievably simple question.</p>
<p>“What  do you say?”</p>
<p>The  place was dead quiet for a single moment.</p>
<p>Then,  Kentaro of all people jumped up and shouted, “Will you sing for us  again?”</p>
<p>The  look was completely destroyed as she looked down at her student, who  thought he was about to get publicly humiliated.</p>
<p>Instead,  Rei let out a defeated sigh. “Only on my terms.”</p>
<p>A  random person shouted, “I'm all for it! You guys deserve it!”</p>
<p>A group  somewhere else started clapping. Another set started shouting  agreements and whistles.</p>
<p>Before  long, the whole crowd was giving them a standing ovation, everyone  yelling their encouragement, and, as Rei had put it, “their  blessings”.</p>
<p>Which  Rei was honestly shocked by. She hadn't actually expected it to  work. Well she had, and yet she hadn't.</p>
<p>But  Minako was grinning at her.</p>
<p>Which  made Rei want to kiss it off of her. Or make it so wide that she'd  stop.</p>
<p>And so  she did.</p>
<p>Kiss  her, that is.</p>
<p>And  that following week, every paper, magazine, and Minako-documentary  had put out something as a tribute to the couple, a couple that even  the bigots or the mass media couldn't bring down.</p>
<p>If you  think about it, how could they?</p>
<p>This is  the Goddess incarnates of Love and Passion we're talking about here.</p>
<p>And  it's them that they'll all be talking about for ages.</p>
<p>Finite</p>
