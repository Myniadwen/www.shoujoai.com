<h1>Other Disguises (part 3 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/otherdis-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>The forest was a vibrant green, birds flitting back
and forth between the branches. It almost looked like
a scene from a childs book, like some cartoon animal
was going to pop up and start talking away at any
moment. Of course, considering the irritable look on
the young lady walking along the path, the cute
character might flee for it&#39;s life.

&quot;This whole place is one giant cliche,&quot; Hotaru Tomoe
muttered to herself, her violet eyes flashing
irritably. The black haired young woman tugged
akwardly at her school uniform as she walked on,
looking for some kind of exit.

&quot;Hotaru-chan,&quot; the familiar woman&#39;s voice called out
cheerfully.

&quot;Who...?&quot; Hotaru looked around curiously.

&quot;Got you!&quot; She pounced from the shadows, the blonde
woman knocking hotaru on her back and laying quite
happily on top of her.

&quot;Minako?&quot; Hotaru blinked in surprise.

Minako Aino smirked down at her, the cat ears on
either side of her head twitching slightly. Her body
has hugged by a tiger stripped onepiece garment, with
a set of matching gloves and boots. Her blue eyes
twinkled with amusement, the scent of her body heady
and sweet.

&quot;I&#39;ve been looking all over for you, Hotaru-chan,&quot;
Minako purred, rubbing her body in a cat-like way
against Hotaru.

&quot;I.. ah...&quot; Hotaru couldn&#39;t seem to think, her heart
pounding as she looked up into those eyes that were
both innocent yet oddly knowing.

&quot;Do you know what I like best about costumes?&quot; Minako
shifted back, sitting up so that her bottom rested on
Hotaru&#39;s legs.

Hotaru felt a bit of relief, yet oddly was
disapointed, when Minako moved. &quot;What?&quot; she croaked,
her throat oddly tight all of a sudden.

Minako reached for the ring at the top of the outfit&#39;s
zipper, nestled in between her pert breasts. &quot;You can
take them off,&quot; she purred as she tugged it down....


&quot;Eeep!&quot; Hotaru sat up in her bed suddently, eyes wide
and hair a mess. She panted, cheeks flushed as she
tried to get her breath back and recover a bit of her
composure. &quot;Where did THAT come from?&quot; she murmured
weakly.

&#39;I never had dreams like that about Chibi-Usa,&#39; Hotaru
thought as she slipped from her bed, her boy&#39;s pajamas
rumpled from her restless sleep and stumbled out of
her room and down to the bathroom. She peered at her
reflection as she brushed her teeth then grabbed a
comb to try and make some order out of her chaotic
hair.

&quot;Better,&quot; Hotaru nodded then headed to the kitchen for
breakfast.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Michiru sang out as Hotaru entered,
the green haired woman pouring out a glass of orange
juice as soon as she walked in.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Hotaru took it and sat down at the table
with a smile. Haruka was reading the paper, a cup of
coffee beside her while Setsuna was taking a turn
cooking breakfast this morning.

&quot;Sleep well?&quot; Setsuna asked as she carefully flipped
an egg over to keep the yolk intact, her long black
hair tied back in a pony tail this morning.

Hotaru felt herself flush slightly but kept her voice
even as she answered honestly, &quot;Yes, except for the
dreams.&quot;

Haruka put the paper down and picked up her mug, the
sandy haired lady taking a long drink of coffee before
sighing happily. &quot;Ah, that&#39;s better,&quot; she smiled. Just
when Hotaru thought she had gotten away with it Haruka
asked curiously, &quot;What kind of dreams?&quot;

&quot;Very odd ones,&quot; Hotaru shrugged, feeling unwilling to
talk about it until she felt she had a better handle
on it herself.

&quot;How do you want your eggs?&quot; Setsuna asked Hotaru as
she casually dished up Haruka and Michiru&#39;s breakfast.

&quot;Scrambled, please,&quot; Hotaru smiled.

&quot;Coming right up,&quot; Setsuna cracked the eggs, humming
to herself cheerfully as she beat them in a high sided
bowl.

&quot;She&#39;s in a awfully good mood this morning,&quot; Michiru
dropped her voice to comment, looking over at Setsuna
covertly.

&quot;Good,&quot; Haruka answered firmly. She looked over at
Hotaru and asked, &quot;So how&#39;s the cosplay thing going?&quot;

Hotaru blushed faintly in memory. &quot;The costume is
almost embarrasing,&quot; she sighed out, &quot;but I think
we&#39;re going to manage.&quot;

&quot;So are you doing a routine or something?&quot; Michiru
asked.

&quot;Sort of,&quot; Hotaru nodded. &quot;The characters Usagi and
Rei play are lovers so they&#39;ll be together, and
Minako, Ami and I are doing something, I think,&quot; she
related.

&quot;Usagi and Rei?&quot; Setsuna had the oddest little smile
on her face as she brought her and Hotaru&#39;s plates of
eggs over.

Michiru smirked, &quot;I wonder if Minako had a hand in the
casting?&quot;

Hotaru chuckled softly, &quot;I think so.&quot;

&#39;She seems to be in a better mood than she was a few
weeks ago,&#39; Setsuna thought with a smile as she dug
into her food.

&quot;Do you want to bet that she set up Ami and Makoto to
be together in this, too?&quot; Haruka offered the
suggestion with a impish grin.

Hotaru looked thoughtful a moment, &quot;You know, you
could be right.&quot;

&quot;Our Senshi of love tends to be a shameless
matchmaker,&quot; Michiru ate her food delicately, &quot;too bad
she has such bad luck in her own love life.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s the whole chasing after boys thing,&quot; Haruka
suggested semi-seriously, &quot;if she&#39;d just find a nice
girl she&#39;s be fine.&quot;

&quot;Not all of us go that way, you know,&quot; Setsuna pointed
out to Haruka with a dignified smile, drinking some of
her juice.

&quot;I don&#39;t see you dating all that much, either,&quot;
Michiru murmured with a little smile.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Setsuna protested.

&#39;My crazy family,&#39; Hotaru thought to herself fondly as
the three ladies argued away good naturedly in the
background.

Later that day Hotaru changed with Minako into their
costumes, reminding the blonde again that she owed her
one. &#39;And I got a good look at Minako,&#39; Hotaru
admitted to herself as they walked to where the others
were practicing.

Rei Hino pushed up her glasses with a white gloved
hand, a striking figure as she stood there in her
military styled uniform. &quot;Ritsuko,&quot; she murmured.

Usagi looked up, her long blonde hair tucked away
beneath the white labcoat she wore. &quot;Gendo,&quot; she
stepped forward... only to have her foot catch the
dangling edge of the long coat and send her sprawling,
Rei along with her.

&quot;Usagi!&quot; Rei scolded, fighting to get the blonde off
of her.

&quot;Sorry, Rei,&quot; Usagi said sheepishly as the two women
got to their feet once again.

&quot;This is going to take some work,&quot; Minako tried her
best to fight back a smile.

&quot;Looks like it,&quot; Hotaru agreed, surprised to realize
she was smiling, too.

&quot;Have you two practiced your kissing scene yet?&quot;
Minako asked them impishly.

&quot;Minako!&quot; both Rei and Usagi turned to protest as one.</pre>
