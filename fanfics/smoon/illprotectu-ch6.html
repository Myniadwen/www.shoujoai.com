<h1>I'll Protect You (part 6 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/runestine.html">rune stine</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/illprotectu-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Rei and Minako went to the Private Shower Room so that Minako can take 
her shower in there. Rei checked the area to make sure that it is safe 
and sound for Minako to take the shower

&quot;You can take your shower now Ms. Aino&quot; Said Rei as she lets Minako 
enter the Shower Room

Rei was about to close the door from the outside when Minako called her

&quot;Rei-chan you&#39;re leaving me again?&quot; Asked Minako

&quot;No, I&#39;ll be staying outside to give you your privacy&quot;

&quot;What if anything happens to me and I wasn&#39;t able to shout for help?&quot;

&quot;Um...&quot; Rei couldn&#39;t answer that question

&quot;Then stay inside here please, I don&#39;t want to be alone&quot; Pleaded Minako

&quot;O-kay&quot; Rei sighed as she enters and locked the door of the shower room

&quot;Thanks Rei-chan! I know you can&#39;t say NO to me!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just doing my job&quot;

Minako started to take off her clothes and wet herself in the shower. 
She noticed her bodyguard&#39;s not looking at her because Rei&#39;s back is 
turned against her. So she decided to make fun of her bodyguard

&quot;Oh come on spill it! You can&#39;t refuse me...Not with my long blonde 
hair, luscious skin, curvaceous body and&#151;-&#39;

&quot;I get the picture&quot; Rei cut in

&quot;Are you sure? Then why are you not looking at me?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t need to, I...I can imagine you in my mind&quot; Rei said nervously

&quot;Well, can you imagine me...naked?&quot; Asked Minako sexily while she 
lathers herself

&quot;W-what? No way, I can&#39;t do that!&quot; Exclaimed Rei

&quot;Why not?&quot; Minako asked as she approaches Rei&#39;s back. Rei&#39;s heart is 
beating heavy and faster as she felt Minako walking near her, then a 
pair of hands held both sides of her weakening shoulders

&quot;If you can&#39;t imagine me naked, you can look at me now to see how I 
look&quot; Said Minako as she turned Rei&#39;s body in front of her so that they 
face each other.

Rei&#39;s eyes were tightly shut; her face was a little sweaty and blushing. 
Minako wanted to giggle but she controlled it and got curious of her 
bodyguards reaction instead

&quot;Come on Rei-chan, we&#39;re both girls. Just take a peek&quot;

&quot;Even so, I still can&#39;t&quot; Said Rei weakly

&quot;Are you still shy at me? We&#39;ve known each other this morning at our 
house right?&quot;

Rei didn&#39;t reply. Minako noticed her bodyguard&#39;s blush faded and 
shrugged

&quot;Why Rei?&quot; Asked a confused Minako, her amused face became a worried one

&#39;Maybe I&#39;m pushing her too much&#39;

&quot;I...couldn&#39;t. I have great respect for you&quot; Said Rei as weak as before, 
eyes still shut

Minako was stunned. Rei respected her, no matter all the naughtiness she 
had done recently up until now

After the short silence Minako spoke

&quot;I am grateful. For almost two days we&#39;ve just met, but for me it seems 
we have known each other so long before. And you are really patient 
enough for my actions and even manage to still respect me&quot;

Minako turned Rei&#39;s back to its original position. Rei&#39;s mind sighed in 
relief

&quot;I&#39;m already in love with you at the first sight. This time you made me 
fall head over heels over you Rei-chan&quot; Minako whispered at Rei&#39;s ear

&quot;H-how can you say that? We&#39;ve just met, you didn&#39;t know me well, you 
didn&#39;t even asked me whether I&#39;m single or do I like lesbians&quot; Rei 
finally opened her eyes

&quot;I have the whole week to know you Rei-chan, and you have the whole week 
to know me. Besides, it&#39;s so obvious that you are single&quot; Minako winked

That was the last sentence Minako said in the shower room as she 
continue taking a shower while Rei stood silent

As Minako finished taking a shower, they went to the dressing room. Rei 
was thankful Minako wore bath robes; if she sees her wrapped in a towel 
again she would probably have a nosebleed

&quot;Rei-chan, why didn&#39;t you have a boyfriend up until now?&quot; Minako 
suddenly asked

&quot;I don&#39;t know. I must have probably been too busy with my police 
training, and no man could approach me when big boss is around&quot; Rei 
chuckled

&quot;Oh, is that so?&quot; Said Minako as she gets to dress

&quot;Didn&#39;t you even want to ask how many boyfriends have I went out with?&quot; 
Asked Minako

&quot;That&#39;s a little private, but I&#39;ll make a guess. Is it more than a 
dozen?&quot; Rei smirked

&quot;Hey I&#39;m not that boy-crazy! I only have three boyfriends ever since&quot; 
Said Minako as she smacked Rei shoulders

&quot;I guess you were serious with your career too&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s because of them I become more focused on my career&quot; Said Minako as 
she slightly gritted her teeth

&quot;An inspiration?&quot; Asked Rei

&quot;Are you kidding? All they care about is what I am, a pop star, all 
three of them, they are all the same. They&#39;re not even concerned on what 
I felt,&quot; Said Minako sarcastically

&quot;I got sick and tired of men wanting me for just popularity and lust. So 
I broke up with my last boyfriend and decided to focus more on my 
future. He always cheats on me&quot; She continued

&quot;It must be that hard to find a one true love&quot; Rei said, her thoughts 
seemed deep

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s why when I met you, so nice and gorgeous and all, I have 
said to my self that I wouldn&#39;t let you go&quot; Minako whispered so soft 
that Rei couldn&#39;t catch what she said

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Nothing, I was remembering something&quot; Minako quickly said

&quot;Oh...I think your boyfriends were a bunch of idiots. Being with someone 
like Aino Minako is probably the luckiest man alive. How could they have 
just wasted such beauty?&quot; Said Rei

Minako felt herself melt inside with Rei&#39;s concern

After Minako gets dressed, they have finally gone back to the studio. 
They saw Wendy talking with the head chief, they stopped when Rei and 
Minako arrived

&quot;Hey big boss, what&#39;s going on? Is there anything wrong?&quot; Asked Minako, 
the head chief looked at Rei who rolled her eyes

&quot;I have just talked to Ms. Wendy, Aino-san. General Satoshi, our main 
commander in chief, had called the TNPH for a short meeting for tomorrow 
and he expected me to assign someone to report the presentation from one 
of my brightest men&quot; The head chief explained

&quot;So...?&quot; Said Minako

&quot;So I have to borrow agent Hino for tomorrow, right before she was 
assigned to you, she had already been assigned to report the 
presentation&quot; The head chief continued carefully

Minako is now frowning, Rei was looking away. She didn&#39;t want to leave 
the pop star

&quot;Relax Aino, Ms. Hino will be back tomorrow afternoon. For the meantime 
agent Kimimoto will replace her&quot; Said Wendy

&quot;I&#39;m really sorry for the inconvenience Aino-san&quot; Apologized the head 
chief

Rei sighed as she approached Minako and held both the pop star&#39;s hands

&quot;I&#39;m sorry about this. I&#39;ll be back as early as I can tomorrow&quot; Rei 
looked at Minako&#39;s watery eyes

&quot;You promise?&quot; Minako pouted

&quot;Yes, I promise&quot; Rei said

Then Minako smiled a bit. The head chief and Rei went though the door 
together to exit the studio and prepare for the presentation tomorrow

Agent Rinka Kimimoto, a not so tall agent with chin-length brown hair, 
healthy skin and natural black Japanese eyes, wearing the same black 
uniform Rei had worn when they first saw her, is now approaching to 
Minako and Wendy&#39;s direction

&quot;Good afternoon, I&#39;m agent Rinka Kimimoto. I&#39;m replacing Rei-sama for a 
while. Pleased to meet you Aino-san and Wendy-san&quot; Said Rinka as she 
shook hands with both Wendy and Minako

&quot;You look younger than Ms. Hino&quot; Wendy commented

&quot;Oh yes Wendy-san. I&#39;m only a year younger than Rei-sama, she&#39;s my idol 
in the TNPH. I&#39;m only an agent in training, I am really happy that I was 
assigned here&quot; Said the young agent

&quot;Really? So you and Rei-cha&#151;I mean Rei have been working in the same 
headquarters?&quot; Minako suddenly asked

&quot;Well yes, I always know everything about her more than everybody else 
but the head chief, she&#39;s like my big sister&quot; Rinka merrily said

Minako held Rinka&#39;s hand and the young agent blushed

&quot;Let&#39;s go back to my hotel room Rinka-san, and tell Aino everything 
about Rei Hino&quot; Minako said as she pulled the younger agent towards the 
exit

&quot;We don&#39;t have any schedule today Ms. Wendy?&quot; Minako asked as she turned 
her head to Wendy

&quot;No, I know you&#39;ll be tired with the rehearsal for today, so I left this 
time blank for you to rest&quot; Wendy said as she follows Minako and Rinka

&quot;Oh good, good. Agent Kimimoto and I have lots of things to talk about&quot; 
Said Minako as she started to ask questions to the young agent about 
Rei. Wendy just sweat dropped

The next morning came, Minako didn&#39;t have much sleep. She was thinking 
about Rei. Her interviews with Rinka didn&#39;t help her from missing her 
raven-haired bodyguard

&quot;When is Rei coming back agent Kimimoto?&quot; Minako asked. Rinka was about 
to reply when Wendy spoke

&quot;Aino can you squeeze a little patience? That&#39;s the thirteenth time you 
asked agent Rinka on when Ms. Hino will be back since this morning&quot; 
Wendy said

&quot;Oh, I just asked her that thirteen times? I&#39;m really sorry agent 
Kimimoto&quot; Minako apologized as she walks back and forth inside the hotel 
room

&quot;No problem, Aino-san, I&#39;m sure Rei-sama will be back as soon as 
possible&quot; Said Rinka

&quot;You have an early rehearsal today remember? And after lunch channel 
eight news will be going to the studio to have another interview, 
followed by channel twelve afternoon shows. You better take a bath so 
that we won&#39;t get late&quot; Wendy said. Minako took the advice and proceeded 
to the hotel shower room

After preparing their selves for the day they went again to the 
Gendou-Takasama studio for Minako&#39;s early-scheduled practice. Minako&#39;s 
back-up dancers are not there yet so they have to wait for them

While they wait for the dancers Minako started to chat with Rinka and 
Wendy to lessen her boredom from waiting. She was getting a little 
impatient not because her back-up dancers were late, but because Rei 
isn&#39;t around

&quot;Ms. Wendy, when are my make-up and fashion artists going to arrive here 
in Japan?&quot; Asked Minako

&quot;They&#39;ll probably be here by Thursday. For the meantime, let the Tokyo&#39;s 
top make-up and fashion artists fix and dress you with your interviews 
for a while&quot; Wendy said as she reads her pocket scheduler

&quot;Agent Kimimoto?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Aino-san?&quot; Rinka replied

&quot;Where did Rei and big boss&#39; meeting being held?&quot; Asked the pop star

&quot;Their meeting is being held at General Satoshi&#39;s office, it is two 
miles from here Aino-san&quot; Said Rinka

&quot;You know where it is?&quot;

&quot; Yes Aino-san, why?&quot; Asked the young bodyguard

&quot;Nothing. I just asked&quot; Said Minako as she smiled innocently

Minutes later Minako&#39;s dancers finally came and they started rehearsing 
their dance steps again. After a three hour practice they had their 
lunch and rested for a while

The media who will take an interview at Minako arrived just in time. 
After them another group of media men came to also take a video and 
interview the pop star

Minako wasn&#39;t in the mood to answer their questions honestly but this 
didn&#39;t make her tired. Her mind is flying in deep space, she tried to 
concentrate but she couldn&#39;t

Now Minako made up her mind and approached Rinka

&quot;Agent Kimimoto, where is General Satoshi&#39;s office again?&quot;</pre>
