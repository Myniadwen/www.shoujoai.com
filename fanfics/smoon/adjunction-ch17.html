<p><em>Minako shook her  head vigorously. “Anyone who is a relative of Sugao-manager is like  family to me. Extended family. And if you don't mind, I'd like to get  to know you better as well.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>You're  in love with her, aren't you?” A soft whisper teased her ear. </em></p>
<p><em>Sugao sighed.  Once she was out of earshot, he murmured, “Save Eika, Minako-chan.  Please, please find a way to help her.” </em></p>
<p>“<em>I didn't ask if you needed  to stay at the shrine. I asked if connection to the shrine keeps you  from enjoying bodily pleasures, especially before marriage.”<br />
  “That...  that... why do you want to know that anyway!”<br />
  Her manager sighed  hopelessly. “Rei is your target this time then? Your technique must  have gotten harsher since I last heard, to cause Minako-chan to  flee...” </em></p>
<p>Rei looked around  as she stepped out ahead of Eika. Seeing the lone person at the  table, she frowned. She started to none too certainly walk towards  the table anyway. Sugao immediately smiled and stood up as she  neared.</p>
<p>“Rei-chan! Everything squared away?  The bill has already been taken care of so...”</p>
<p>Rei's brows  narrowed just enough to let others know that she was most definitely  not happy. “Where's Minako?”</p>
<p>Sugao's smile  faltered for just the slightest instant, but Rei still caught it. She  ignored the presence when Eika came up behind her.</p>
<p>Sugao tried to  casually laugh it off. “I remembered an early show offer that was  still pending, and when I mentioned it to Minako-chan she said she  didn't mind taking it on. So she's gone on ahead to her room to get a  good night's sleep. She isn't nearly as cheerful in the morning if  she doesn't have her precious beauty sleep after all. That said... I  think we'll have to postpone the little 'sleepover' of sorts for  another night, I'm afraid. <em>So</em> sorry about that.”</p>
<p>Eika smiled smoothly, though she'd been mildly surprised at Minako  leaving while they were in the restroom. She didn't seem like the  type to be so discourteous unless... Eika laughed privately at her  deduction. So it had worked after all. “That's all right, Uncle.  There's still so much time to be made good use of. Rei, would you  like a ride back on my way home?”</p>
<p>Rei jolted, startled as she whipped around to look at Eika. “Why  would you-?”</p>
<p>Eika's smile was gentle, as well as patient. “Minako drove you  here, didn't she? And as Uncle Sugao stays here, it's hardly  necessary to ask him to, a waste of gas, actually, when I drove here  myself and I intend to drive myself back. And I wouldn't <em>dream</em> of letting you go home at this time of night without an escort.”</p>
<p>Rei's nose twitched. She inwardly cursed Eika's logical reasoning.  She looked at Sugao, hoping for some sort of help.</p>
<p>“What a great idea! Eika-chan, you're  as generous and caring as always, aren't you?” Rei's heart fell. So  much for that idea.</p>
<p>Eika clapped a hand on Rei's shoulder, a pressure which was felt but  not heavy. “I'll be sure to take good care of Minako's <em>best  friend</em>, Uncle. After all, Minako's so much more to you than just  someone whose time you manage, isn't that right?”</p>
<p>Sugao nodded sagely with an overtly serious thinking pose. “Indeed,  you're right about that, Eika-chan. I daresay it's almost as if she's  my own daughter.”</p>
<p>Rei tried to hide her urge to gag. <em>How the heck would Minako have  turned out if </em>this <em>guy was her parent, raising her, sharing  DNA?</em> Rei shuddered. <em>I don't even want to think of it...</em></p>
<p>Eika smiled, looking at Rei from the corner of her eye. “Then that  would make Minako my proverbial cousin, which makes Rei-chan here an  important person that should be protected, no?”</p>
<p>Sugao nodded again. “Well then! It's decided! Shall we go? I'll  walk you to the door.”</p>
<p><em>The door to the parking garage?</em> <em>And hey, wait a minute! I  never agreed to this in the first place!</em></p>
<p>Rei looked over as Sugao started leading the trek out and the hand  left her shoulder. Which was a bad move because Eika had lowered her  head down to that level, supposedly to whisper something to her.</p>
<p>Their noses touched.</p>
<p>Eika smiled at Rei's frightened-doe impression.</p>
<p>And then kissed her nose.</p>
<p>“Don't be afraid of showing how you  feel. It'll eat you up inside if you try to cage a beast like  lust-colored love.” Almost as an afterthought, she added, “And  Rei? I know it's too much to ask of you now, but trust me, alright?  I'll guide you through this. Just in my own way.”</p>
<p>And with that, Eika placed a hand on Rei's elbow and nudged her to  start moving.</p>
<p>Rei was still caught in the headlights.</p>
<p><em>Trust? Guide? Through what? </em>Minako had left... and now Eika  was taking her home...</p>
<p>They had reached the parking lot before  Rei had realized they had said good night to Sugao. And then she  found herself standing in front of a sleek dark blue vehicle with  nice black leather interior.</p>
<p>She also found Eika watching her from  the other side of the car. The woman grinned, noticing her change in  focus. She opened her car door. “Ready to go?”</p>
<p>Rei limply nodded, giving up arguing at  this point and opening the passenger seat door.</p>
<p>It was quiet at first, but in the  silence of the ride, Rei's thoughts reached their peak insistence.  She just couldn't hold it in anymore.</p>
<p>“How do you think of me?”</p>
<p>Eika blinked at the sudden question.  She glanced over at Rei for a moment, but then smiled, her eyes  returning to the road. “How do I think of you? How do you expect me  to think of you?”</p>
<p>As her question was given room for  answering, Rei elaborated, a rush of pent up confusion tumbling out.  “You don't normally treat strangers this way, right? We've only  just met today. And yet, you, every time we do meet, every time you  get the chance, you... you... it's absurd! Normal people don't do  things like that out of nowhere!” Rei stopped. “Especially if  they aren't drunk or under any influence.”</p>
<p>Eika couldn't help it. She laughed. She  laughed for longer than Rei could ever remember her laughing, though  it wasn't unbearably long. “I'm sorry, but I was wondering how long  it would take for you to say something like that. But you see, you  more than anyone should know this. Normal people are only people who  have solid masks to hide behind. Boring masks. But everyone wears one  mask or another. If, for no other reason than to avoid publicity. You  have a secret like that, too, don't you.”</p>
<p>Rei froze, remembering the times she  had nearly been found out as Sailor Mars.</p>
<p>“I'm just speculating of course,”  Eika added, which reminded Rei that she did that a lot, which  incidentally made Rei rat herself out, which was bothersome. “Like  I said, <em>everyone</em> has a mask to hide their secrets. And that's  perfectly alright with me. The only thing is, my mask is different  than the normal person's. And it shows in everything related to me.  That you might observe, at least.”</p>
<p>Eika paused, trying  to remember exactly how Rei's question had been asked. “But you're  right, I don't normally treat strangers like this. Not even in front  of the store. But that's because to me, you aren't really a stranger.  This is just the first time I've met you in person. But I won't lie  to you- I <em>have</em> taken a liking to you. But I have someone in my  life that I hold above you, and when it comes down to it, this hobby  of mine won't make me stray past simple flirting. I honestly do want  to see you with your Minako.”</p>
<p>Rei flushed,  shrinking in on herself. What did one say to that? “Who's your...  someone?” It was a long shot but she guessed, “Your uncle?”</p>
<p>Eika let out a bark  of laughter. “Hino-chan! Please! I love him dearly, but he really  is my blood uncle. Why would flirting have anything remotely to do  with him?”</p>
<p>Rei's flush grew  deeper. “Ahm, yeah... sorry. You're right. So... who is it?”</p>
<p>Eika smiled.  “That's a secret. But it's not important for you to know, so it's  better left at that.”</p>
<p>But something told  Rei it <em>could</em> be very important. She straightened in her seat.  “Hold on! You love this person, then, right? In a romantic way?”</p>
<p>Eika paused.  Reluctantly, she admitted, “Yes. Why are you so curious?”</p>
<p>Rei continued on,  as if she were a detective assistant that had finally found somewhere  to one up the detective she worked under. “Do they know?”</p>
<p>Eika sighed,  guessing ahead of time why Rei had asked. “As a matter of fact, I  have. A long time ago.”</p>
<p>The fire in Rei  simmered down, almost disappointed. “Oh... and they don't mind your  hobby?”</p>
<p>Eika laughed  lightly. “Actually, come to think of it, they disapprove of it  quite a bit. But not in the way you think. Can we drop this now?”</p>
<p>Rei was suspicious  at that. “Why?”</p>
<p>Eika sighed, the  car rolling to a stop. “Because we're here.”</p>
<p>Rei looked out the  window, and sure enough, there was her shrine. She looked back to  Eika.</p>
<p>“Do you still want to visit me the  day after tomorrow?”</p>
<p>Rei hesitated.  “What would you do then?”</p>
<p>“If you visit me?” Eika considered  it before answering, “Little tidbits here and there. Mostly just  talk with you. I'm not really allowed to do much else in the store  because other customers <em>do </em>sometimes drop in then. Why, are  you worried?”</p>
<p>Rei hesitated  again. “With you, I'm not sure what is most worrisome for me...”</p>
<p>As if beckoned,  Eika leaned over and kissed Rei's ear, which made her start and jerk  away. Eika smiled softly, tucking a strand of hair behind Rei's ear.  “Whose touch scares you more? That of the one you love who doesn't  know it yet, making you afraid that you'll give yourself away in a  bad light... or that of a stranger, someone you don't know, but  someone who has the same traits as the one you love, but you don't  doubt would accept your affection?”</p>
<p>Rei looked at her,  startled, at this admission. “You... you expect me to... to...  return... it?”</p>
<p>Eika closed her  eyes for a moment, moving down to lean her cheek against Rei's  shoulder. “I'm sorry, I shouldn't haven't added that. Don't fall in  love with me. No one wants that to happen. I pray to the gods that  you don't. I just want to help you. Get you used to the feel of doing  something you're not used to for the sake of the one you <em>do</em> love.”</p>
<p>Rei was quiet. “If  someone sees us together, what am I supposed to call you?”</p>
<p>“I told you, you can call me Eika.”</p>
<p>“Not that.” Rei frowned, bothered  and yet not bothered by the feeling of Eika's head on her shoulder.  It actually reminded her of that one night... so long ago... She  shook her head. “Mutual or not, friends don't flirt with each  other, as you say. And I can't say how I really met you, so there  isn't much of a reason...”</p>
<p>“Does everything in this world  require a reason?”</p>
<p>“Of- er... well... it makes things  easier,” Rei finally settled upon.</p>
<p>Eika smiled softly.  “I guess that's true. Acceptance makes things easier too. Of things  that have no real reason.”</p>
<p>Rei leaned her had  back against the seat. “Are you planning on staying here all  night?”</p>
<p>Eika's eyes were  still closed. “I'll let you in on a little secret.” She paused,  as if for emphasis. “After a certain time in the course of 24  hours, I start to get really sleepy. Not tired, so much as I just  want to curl up and sleep.”</p>
<p>Rei paused, her  mind wrapping itself around the idea.</p>
<p>“Ne, Hino-chan... you're alone in the  shrine for tonight, aren't you? Since Minako isn't staying over  anymore?”</p>
<p>Rei, calming after  she reminded herself that she <em>had</em> mentioned that this  afternoon, murmured, “Well... yeah...”</p>
<p>“Would you put me up for the night?  Rinka, she takes night classes, you know. She's not available right  now. And I don't ever drive after it hits me... I once- no, twice if  you count the smaller one- got into an accident because I tried to  push it back. So... could you?”</p>
<p>Rei paused. “Just  the roof? Not in the same room or anything, right?”</p>
<p>Eika chuckled.  “Yes, just a roof. I'll leave in the morning.”</p>
<p>Rei wrinkled her  nose. She really <em>was</em> getting used to this presence. “... Why  did you offer to drive me back if you knew when you'd get... sleepy?”</p>
<p>“I <em>don't</em> know. It's a two-hour  range, generally. I thought I'd be able to make it back alright...  but...”</p>
<p>Rei sighed,  unfastening her seat belt. “Well, I suppose it <em>was</em> nice of  you to volunteer to drive me back like that, so I guess a night  couldn't hurt. It isn't as if I haven't done that... a lot.”</p>
<p>Eika smiled, slowly  getting up into sitting position. “Thank... you.”</p>
<p>Rei watched as Eika  lethargically got out of the car, and then suddenly found herself  acting as a crutch as Eika swayed before getting to the stairs.</p>
<p>Eika's smile came  and went, but it came frequently. “Thank you. And I really am sorry  for the trouble.”</p>
<p>Rei shook her head.  “It's... it's all right. Like I said- it's not like I haven't done  this sort of thing before. Come on, stay awake a <em>little</em> while  longer at least. I swear, I'm almost tempted to call you a child.”</p>
<p>Eika chuckled  softly. “Only 'tempted'?”</p>
<p>Rei muttered,  “Almost. But... but I know someone else who's older than me, but  turns in early like that too.”</p>
<p>“Hino-chan...”</p>
<p>“Mm?” Rei glanced away from the  stairs. “What?”</p>
<p>Eika smiled,  tilting her head to touch Rei's. “You... you're really soft.”</p>
<p>Rei nearly tripped.  “<em>What</em>?”</p>
<p>Eika shook her  head. “Your skin. It's really soft. And you're perfect for  hugging.”</p>
<p>Rei's eyes  narrowed. And then she realized that in the process of swinging  Eika's arm around her shoulders, Eika could clearly feel her body, as  she was wearing a thin, sleeveless shirt. Rei flushed a little.  “Um... thanks?”</p>
<p>Eika chuckled. “Are  we there yet? I can't really...”</p>
<p>Rei looked up.  “We're sort of almost there.” She adjusted her grip. “Are you <em>sure</em> you're not drunk?”</p>
<p>Eika smiled. <em>She  says that to me too. </em>“Yes I'm sure.”</p>
<p>There was a bit of  silence. Rei wondered if Eika had drifted off to sleep, but dismissed  that since Eika was still bringing her feet up to climb the steps.</p>
<p>But as they leveled  off to finally go up the walkway, the footfalls were noticeably  slower. “Ei... Eika?” Rei paused. “Are you awake still?”</p>
<p>The head moved a  little, the eyes having long since closed, allowing her to be  completely guided by the priestess. “Steps finally over with?”</p>
<p>Rei chuckled.  “Yeah, steps conquered. I'll take you straight to the closest room,  alright?”</p>
<p>“Mm... yes... thank you.”</p>
<p>“Um... you might want to open your  eyes so you don't somehow get lost on your way out?”</p>
<p>“Which way is your room?” Eika  opened her eyes obediently.</p>
<p>Rei pointed with  her free hand. “Over there, near the kitchen.”</p>
<p>Eika looked over...  and nodded deeply in fair recognition. She then somewhat lucidly  controlled her steps as Rei led her to the side, the main building  that wasn't the holy shrine itself.</p>
<p>They had just  reached the door to the room Rei had chosen, when Eika suddenly  slumped, catching Rei offguard as she tried to find balance again.  “Oi!”</p>
<p>“I'm... I'm sorry... my legs just  gave out on me. I'll... Just give me a moment...”</p>
<p>Rei shook her head.  Under her breath she muttered, “I swear, it's almost as if you're  crippled or something.” Despite that, she put more of Eika's weight  on herself and slowly brought the visitor in. Then, carefully, she  eased Eika against the wall and went to set out the futon, as Eika  obviously wasn't in any shape to walk let alone do anything that  required energy.</p>
<p>Eika looked through  lidded eyes at Rei, watching her. She would have said more, but words  were wearing her down as well. She shouldn't have talked so much in  the car.</p>
<p>Rei held out a hand  to her as she finished, even folding back a corner of the blanket to  make it easier for her to get in. Eika smiled, slowly accepting the  gesture, but she could barely stand up to cross the small distance to  the bed. But, with Rei's help, she managed, and before <em>too</em> long, she was safely tucked in.</p>
<p>Rei sighed as she  leaned back. “Well, that's that. Rest well, okay?”</p>
<p>Eika smiled. “Thank  you, Hino-chan.”</p>
<p>Rei sighed again,  softer. “Stop thanking me, it's not that big a deal.”</p>
<p>But Eika was  already sound asleep.</p>
<p>Rei shook her head  hopelessly. She watched Eika for a few minutes, making sure she  really was 'sound asleep' and thought about how the day had unfolded.  All too fast for her liking. But... Rei chuckled softly.</p>
<p><em>Maybe she's a missionary from  Kami-sama. Sent to kick me off my comfortable bum.</em></p>
<p>She leaned down,  unclasping Eika's hair clip and setting it to the side so that it  wouldn't hurt when she rolled over. Eika continued to sleep.</p>
<p>Rei stood up, and  with one last look, closed the door behind her. <em>I guess it's true  what they say; people resemble angels most when they're sound asleep.</em></p>
