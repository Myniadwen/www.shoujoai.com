Sincerity in Your Eyes

Makoto sighed when a beam of sunlight finally filtered through the 
blinds of her windows and shone directly over her closed eyelids. She 
rolled over to her side with every intention of sleeping to her heart&#39;s 
content and thus, missing another day of school. Her third day, that 
is...

She didn&#39;t need to worry about parents barging in her room and demand 
why she was absent this often. She lived alone in an apartment she 
inherited from her &quot;Bancho.&quot; Some inheritance... It was apparent that 
the former tenant did not take good care of this apartment. There were 
cracks on parts of the wall where the dirty-white wallpaper did not 
cover. There were scratches on the wooden floor and a discoloration 
where Makoto had studiously scrubbed unknown stains away or where she 
poured lye over it. The only window to her room was stuck half-open, 
thus the blinds. At least the ceiling was clean and sturdy enough. And 
she had her own bathroom and a &quot;balcony&quot; of some sorts (actually, it was 
more like a fire escape than anything).

It was a relatively small apartment, that&#39;s why the young girl could not 
afford the luxury of filling it up with decorations that would make her 
home feel more like home. But even if she could, she still could not 
afford to spend her meager savings on impractical things. Paying her 
tuition was hard enough.

The thought of school started to depress her. She hated Juuban. She 
hated the situation Nishikawa and the other bullies had forced on her. 
Makoto had thought she could leave such things behind when she 
transferred here to Minato. She was obviously mistaken. No one can run 
from their pasts... but she could sleep it all away for a day.

But alas, it was not to be-- especially when she had annoying neighbors 
who insist on mothering her. Or acting as big sisters... or something 
like that.

&quot;Wakey, wakey Mako-chaaaaaaan!&quot; Seiya sang loudly into her ear.

&quot;You&#39;re missing school again?&quot; Taiki asked dispassionately as she and 
Yaten walked inside the room after Seiya. If Makoto would open her eyes 
she would see that the cross-dressing siblings were exchanging 
mischievous looks. &quot;You know what we must do, sisters.&quot;

The brunette knew all too well what that meant. She immediately 
scrambled out of bed, barely missing Seiya, Taiki and Yaten, as they 
cannonballed themselves onto Makoto&#39;s bed. &quot;Are you crazy!&quot; Makoto 
panted from her place on the floor-- her green pajamas and her long hair 
were askew from her hasty leap. &quot;You guys nearly broke my neck last time 
you did that!&quot;

&quot;I see a definite improvement in her time and response.&quot; Taiki concluded 
breezily as she turned to her sisters and ignored the glare that Makoto 
was aiming her way.

&quot;She actually managed to get out of bed this time.&quot; Yaten added with a 
smirk.

&quot;But she still fell on her ass.&quot; Seiya&#39;s eyes were closed, her arms 
across her chest, as she pondered this unfortunate fact. &quot;We must do it 
again tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Like hell...&quot; Makoto grumbled crankily and stood up. She placed her 
hands on her hips and eyed the trio of grinning women sitting 
comfortably on her bed. &quot;Why are you guys wearing the penguin suits? I 
thought male hosts do their work at night?&quot;

Seiya laughed at that as she looked down at her penguin suit. &quot;We&#39;re 
going to audition as back-up singers for the Hospital Benefit today,&quot; 
she explained. &quot;And...&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;re here for your freebie, right?&quot; Makoto cut in and crossed her 
arms defiantly. &quot;Couldn&#39;t you guys just eat out? I&#39;m running low on 
funds here and with all of you coming here everyday to leech off of me 
is just... Or better yet, have your so-called girlfriends cook something 
for you!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be so stingy! Sheesh.&quot; Yaten exclaimed. &quot;We, like, help you pay 
the rent too!&quot;

&quot;With this!&quot; Makoto pulled a drawer out of her study desk to reveal the 
wrinkled scraps of paper that had I.O.U. written on each of them. &quot;You 
earn more than enough with your jobs at night. So cough up the dough 
before I feed you!&quot; She knew it was hopeless no matter how much she 
demanded though. The problem with these girls is that they didn&#39;t know 
how to keep their money in their pockets. Makoto released an exasperated 
breath as she waited for their answer.

&quot;We&#39;ll get famous first before paying it all back!&quot; The platinum-blonde 
retorted defensively. &quot;We ARE going to pay it back. In fact, we might 
pay it all back when we make this audition. So don&#39;t be such an uptight 
bi--&quot;

Taiki immediately clamped a hand over her younger sister&#39;s mouth before 
the damage could be done. Really... She could not put these two together 
in the same room and expect them to play nice.

&quot;This is the last time, Mako-chan.&quot; Seiya pleaded, &quot;We didn&#39;t eat lunch 
and supper yesterday and we&#39;re really hungry. And you know how much we 
love your cooking.&quot; She paused to gauge her friend&#39;s reaction and saw 
that the stony expression on her face didn&#39;t even crack.

It was time for some serious firepower... She exchanged furtive glances 
with her sisters before they all got off the bed and knelt in front of 
Makoto.

&quot;Please oh please Mako-chama!&quot; They begged simultaneously and blinked 
their tear-filled eyes rapidly. Seiya decided to up the ante and started 
to claw at the other girl&#39;s pants weakly. &quot;We&#39;re sooooooo hungry.&quot;

Makoto stared down at them in disbelief before bursting out in 
laughter-- the first one in three days. &quot;Get up you bozos. You look 
ridiculous.&quot; She said after the laughter died down to mere chuckling. 
She looked down at them fondly. What would she do without them? She 
would probably still be brooding over every crap that&#39;s been happening 
to her as of late. &quot;What do you guys want to eat anyway?&quot;

&quot;I want Okonomiyaki!&quot; Yaten announced.

&quot;This early in the morning?&quot; Taiki gawked at her.

&quot;Shut up, it&#39;s what I want.&quot;

&quot;Of all the rude things...!&quot;

&quot;I want pickled rice and fish. No wait... I want an American breakfast! 
Fried bacon and eggs to be exact... No wait, I want bacon and pickled 
rice instead. No, no! That&#39;s weird. I want...&quot; Seiya rattled off 
indecisively.

&#39;On second thought,&#39; Makoto sighed, &#39;my life would be a whole lot less 
complicated without these three.&#39; She began to move out of her room and 
towards her little makeshift kitchen-slash-dining room. The others 
exchanged victorious grins before getting up to follow her. &quot;I&#39;m going 
to make you all pancakes.&quot; She glanced at the sisters to see them about 
to protest then forcefully added, &quot;PERIOD.&quot; And everyone immediately 
shut their mouths. &quot;Now make yourselves some juice or coffee and grab a 
seat.&quot;

The sisters smiled bemusedly at Makoto&#39;s back before moving to prepare 
their drinks as they were told. When they were in her territory-- her 
kitchen to be precise, the younger girl always seemed to be in full 
mother-hen mode, or a bossy wife as Seiya often teased. Of course, 
outside this, the roles were definitely reversed.

Yaten found herself thinking back to the time when they first knew about 
Makoto. The apartment their friend was living in now used to belong to 
someone else... an odd guy, who looked like he came out of one of those 
cheesy gangster movies, who insisted that everyone call him Bancho.

One night, Bancho invited them all to his place for his &quot;good bye 
party.&quot; Of course Yaten couldn&#39;t care less if the weirdo left. But she 
went anyway.

They learned that Bancho was going back to his hometown in Okinawa to 
take over his father&#39;s fishing business. He lamented over leaving his 
gang behind especially his &quot;right-hand man&quot; named Makoto. It was clear 
that Bancho cared a great deal for this Makoto guy. Of course, Yaten, 
who didn&#39;t realize Makoto was actually a girl back then, had thought, 
&#39;This guy&#39;s a fag?&#39;

The &quot;deep brotherly love that was rare in modern gangsters&quot; Bancho had 
loved to brag about suddenly took on a whole new meaning for Yaten. With 
a shiver, she banished the horrifying thoughts immediately.

By the end of the night, when everyone was sufficiently buzzed with 
alcohol, Bancho made them all promise to watch out for Makoto. She and 
her sisters just shrugged and muttered noncommittal &#39;okays.&#39;

The next day, Bancho left.

The following day after that they finally met her. It was early in the 
morning, when Yaten, Taiki and Seiya came back from their night jobs. 
They saw a girl hunched outside the closed door of Bancho&#39;s apartment, 
fast asleep. Taiki had frowned and approached her first. She gently 
shook the other awake.

When the girl looked up with tired and empty eyes, Yaten felt a pang of 
sympathy.

&quot;Are you Makoto?&quot; Taiki had asked.

&quot;Yes...&quot; The stranger had answered huskily.

And they had been friends ever since. &#39;Who knew...&#39; Yaten thought, &#39;My 
sisters and I found it easy to fulfill our promise to Bancho after all.&#39;

&quot;Say Mako-chan...&quot; Taiki began thoughtfully as she, along with the 
others, watched their friend putter about in the small kitchen. &quot;You&#39;re 
not going to school anytime soon, right? Like today maybe?&quot;

&quot;Nope.&quot; The brunette answered as she started to break the eggs over the 
bowl.

&quot;Good!&quot; Yaten clapped her hands together decisively. &quot;You&#39;re coming with 
us to the auditions.&quot; Taiki and Seiya seemed surprised that she had been 
the one to offer first. Yaten was not known to be openly solicitous, 
especially to Makoto. But they smiled and nodded when the brunette 
paused and seemed to be considering it.

&quot;And what? Watch all the blood dribble out of everyone&#39;s ears when you 
sing?&quot; Makoto teased. &quot;No thanks.&quot;

&quot;Ha ha...&quot; The shorter girl sneered, paused, then quietly she added, 
&quot;Seriously, we want you to be there... for um... support.&quot; This seemed 
to catch the brunette off-guard and she had to look at Yaten to see if 
she heard wrong. When the other girl looked back at her intensely, 
Makoto realized that her friend had indeed said what she thought she 
said.

&quot;Sure.&quot; Makoto shrugged nonchalantly and turned back around to continue 
preparing the pancakes. &quot;I&#39;ll come with you guys. Just don&#39;t expect me 
not to take my hands off my ears when you go up on stage.&quot;

&quot;Awesome!&quot; Seiya looked pleased. &quot;We have another penguin suit already 
prepared for you back in our flat.&quot;

&quot;Ooooohhhhh no!&quot; Makoto whirled around again and pointed the egg beater 
at them threateningly. &quot;We are NOT going as the queer quadruplets! I 
refuse! On the other hand... feel free to look like clones, but you&#39;re 
not making me wear it!&quot;

&quot;But Mako-chaaaaan!&quot; Seiya whined. &quot;We need to look united! Didn&#39;t 
Bancho make the gang dress all alike? &#39;United we stand, divided we 
fall.&#39; That way, our circle of support will never be broken!&quot;

The younger girl blushed and shook her head adamantly. &quot;That was a long 
time ago! I was young and stupid! Besides, I&#39;m not going to be up there 
singing with you guys. I don&#39;t HAVE to look like you.&quot;

&quot;Please Mako-chan?&quot;

&quot;No!&quot;

&quot;Pleeeeeeeeeeease Mako-chama?&quot;

&quot;Never!&quot;

The auditions were being held in the Kusanagi Hotel in Roppongi. 
Roppongi was famous for being one of the most prominent nightclub 
districts in Japan. It was the district that never sleeps. It was also a 
place where sinful pleasures can be fulfilled. So it was of no surprise 
as to why one would see foreigners everywhere. It was one of the best 
tourist spots in Minato. But of course, the Japanese still outnumbered 
them. Minako&#39;s mother had been brilliant and shrewd enough to secure a 
place in the heart of this &quot;paradise&quot; to build one of her biggest hotels 
which, was now one of the most popular hotels in Roppongi. Of course, 
she forbid Minako from coming to this place, often thinking that the 
influence of the district&#39;s sleazy yet sophisticated atmosphere would 
corrupt her daughter even further.

So it was because of this reason that Minako would often choose 
Roppongi&#39;s Kusanagi Hotel to hold auditions. It was a good excuse to 
stay overnight, short auditions notwithstanding.

&quot;I don&#39;t see why we have to have new back-up singers, Minako-chan.&quot; 
Michiru whispered to the blonde from her seat beside her. They were 
inside one of Kusanagi&#39;s function rooms. It was one of the smallest ones 
since only she, Minako and the song director named Katsuhiko were the 
only people who would not be able to leave the room any time soon. They 
had a makeshift stage set up against one of the walls in front of the 
judges. There was a microphone in the center. All in all, it was really 
just an ordinary setting for an audition.

The real chaos, however, was outside the room where all the hopeful and 
antsy singers stood in line, waiting.

Minako did not answer Michiru and pretended to listen to a duo of 
dorky-looking guys sing their hearts out. They weren&#39;t bad... if only 
they just took better care of their appearance. The pop star concluded 
that they simply lacked the Star quality they needed to be a part of 
Aino Minako&#39;s crew. Even back-up singers were scrutinized by the public. 
This was the kind of business that was meticulous in choosing the best 
overall appearance and performance of their Stars for the fans.

&quot;Oh my god... You didn&#39;t.&quot; Michiru gasped beside her. The blonde was 
finally forced to focus on her manager when the other woman firmly shook 
her shoulder. &quot;You didn&#39;t...&quot; She repeated, hoping against hope that her 
Talent didn&#39;t cross the line yet again.

Minako shrugged helplessly. &quot;He was cute...&quot;

&quot;Minako!&quot; Michiru exclaimed in exasperation causing the startled singers 
on stage to stop singing. &quot;This is the second time!&quot;

&quot;There are lots of great back-up singers out there.&quot; The blonde offered 
meekly.

&quot;That&#39;s not the point!&quot; Michiru groaned and pinched the bridge of her 
nose. She was starting to get a headache. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t form 
relationships with your co-workers if you have no intention of taking 
them seriously! And what if the brothers left you at the last minute? 
The Benefit would&#39;ve been a disaster!&quot;

&quot;But they didn&#39;t and we&#39;re looking for more reliable singers right now.&quot;

&quot;Whatever.&quot; Michiru sighed in resignation. Sometimes she wanted to 
throttle the other girl. She was the most irresponsible, the flightiest 
person she had ever met. Her boss was right when he warned her that she 
would have her hands full with this girl. It was a good thing for Minako 
that Michiru wasn&#39;t the type to give up on the job that easily. And she 
was lucky Minako seemed likeable when she wasn&#39;t acting like such a 
spoiled brat.

&quot;What happened to them?&quot; Katsuhiko, who had been silent throughout the 
exchange, suddenly leaned forward curiously. The eavesdropping singers 
did the same.

&quot;None of your business!&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t want to know.&quot;

The women snapped at the same time.

&quot;Next!&quot; Minako suddenly yelled, forgoing politeness as she waved the 
boys away. Her mood was starting to sour. Dejected, the participants 
left. They were replaced by three of the most beautiful men the pop star 
had ever seen. Minako knew she was drooling, oh it was shameless... But 
she couldn&#39;t help it.

&quot;Hello, I&#39;m Kou Seiya.&quot; The black-haired youth on the center boldly 
announced on the microphone. &quot;This is Kou Yaten and Kou Taiki. We are 
also known as the Three Lights.&quot; There was no gushing about how 
fortunate they were to be graced by her presence, and there was no hint 
of nervousness... Minako liked them already.

Michiru&#39;s face was expressionless when she saw the dreamy look on her 
Star&#39;s face. Then out of the corner of her eye, she caught a glimpse of 
another figure a little behind her to the side. This one was dressed 
similarly in the same tuxedo as the Three Lights were wearing. He was 
scowling and had his arms crossed in front of his chest. At least... she 
assumed it was a &#39;he.&#39; He was so androgynous.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; she called out, &quot;aren&#39;t you going up on stage?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not singing...&quot; Came the grumbled answer. &quot;I&#39;m here to cheer them 
on.&quot; Though the way this boy said it made it sound like he was 
announcing his own death penalty.

The blonde tore her eyes away from the Three Lights to look at what her 
manager was fussing about. When her curious blue eyes met penetrating 
green, she gasped. The sensation those eyes evoked in her felt so strong 
it sent chills down her spine. Then it was broken when Michiru waved a 
hand in front of her face and called her name.

It felt like seconds... short and abrupt seconds. But the truth was, she 
had been staring at this boy for longer than it was appropriate. She 
finally noticed the odd look that everyone was giving her and felt her 
blood rush to her face. &quot;Um... Y-you can proceed.&quot; She told the Three 
Lights and gave them a charming smile to cover up her embarrassment.

They began to sing, and their voices blended together perfectly. Michiru 
stood up. Minako watched her short and discreet journey towards the 
mysterious boy in surreptitious glances, only paying half-attention to 
the singers in front of them, who, Minako had to admit, were incredible!

Michiru and the stranger whispered furiously for a moment before they 
finally looked like they had come to an agreement. The aqua-haired woman 
returned to her seat while the boy quietly walked out of the room.

Minako wanted to cry out, to call him back and demand for his name. But 
she had a job to do first. She impatiently waited for the Three Lights 
to finish, firmly announced them as &quot;perfect back-up singers&quot; and 
congratulated them, before running out of the door.

There was a dumbfounded stillness in the function room for a moment 
before Seiya and Yaten cheered and hugged each other while Michiru and 
Taiki exchanged raised eyebrows. Katsuhiko simply sat there, confused as 
heck, but happy that the audition was finally done and over with.

Minako finally found him at the lobby, standing in front of a vending 
machine, his back turned to her. She hesitated. It did not occur to her 
before that she could&#39;ve just asked the Three Lights what their 
companion&#39;s name was. But the overwhelming need to be near him was too 
powerful to resist. She was confused. Why did she feel this strongly 
about this stranger?

&#39;Is this love at first sight?&#39;

She shook her head at THAT preposterous thought. &#39;This is not a movie, 
Minako.&#39; She scolded herself. &#39;This is pathetic... I should just leave.&#39; 
And yet, she could not help but wonder at these curious feelings. It 
wasn&#39;t love... It couldn&#39;t be love... She did not feel any love or even 
like for him. How could she? She hardly knew him.

It felt more like a connection... a feeling of meeting a kindred spirit 
for the first time.

A kindred spirit... The idea made her feel strangely relieved-- the kind 
she could only feel on stage or with her best friend-- the only two 
things that gave her solace from her troubled world of business and 
neglect.

She quietly approached the boy, stopping just a few inches behind him. 
She watched him for a while. He did not seem to notice her; too 
engrossed was he at trying to decide which candy bar to get. She finally 
leaned slightly to the side to look at his face. He was cute, but not 
overly good-looking like the Three Lights she had been drooling over. 
&quot;Excuse me...&quot;

He jumped, and clutched at his chest in fright. &quot;Kami!&quot; He exclaimed 
before frowning down at her. &quot;You scared the heck out of me!&quot;

Minako did not answer at first and simply smiled at him. It took a 
moment for the recognition to light his eyes and when it did, he stepped 
back warily. The pop star was pleased. He obviously and finally realized 
who it was that was standing in front of him. &quot;Um... What do you want?&quot;

&quot;Your name,&quot; she replied sweetly before tilting her head at him cutely. 
No one could resist Aino Minako when she was at her cutest.

But the boy frowned, and there was a flash of irritation in his face 
before it was replaced by a mask of forced politeness. &quot;I&#39;m sorry... But 
I don&#39;t give out my name to strangers.&quot;

&#39;What?&#39; Didn&#39;t this guy knew who she was? Minako was astonished but the 
sweet smile on her face remained unchanged as she offered her hand for a 
handshake. &quot;Oh! I&#39;m sorry. The name&#39;s Aino Minako.&quot;

&quot;Pleased to meet you Aino Minako-san...&quot; The boy replied politely and 
shook her hand briefly. He did not say anything further.

Minako was beginning to feel awkward as they both stared at each other. 
She was the first to look down however, feeling chagrined at the obvious 
dislike the other was emitting despite his respectful facade. She 
re-evaluated the scene all over again and keenly realized how her 
coyness might be misinterpreted as rudeness by this boy. She had to 
change her strategy.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she mumbled to her feet, &quot;can we start over?&quot; She took a 
deep breath before looking up at the boy shyly and offered her hand 
again. &quot;Hi, my name is Aino Minako. Can I be your friend?&quot;

This time, there was real warmth in the other&#39;s eyes and he gently 
clasped her hand again. &quot;I&#39;m Kino Makoto.&quot; He told her. &quot;And that 
depends.&quot;

&quot;Depends on what?&quot; Minako could not help but feel her stomach tighten 
with anticipation. What could she do to get this guy to like her?

&quot;It depends on what you think of my friends&#39; awful singing voices.&quot;

The reply was so unexpected the blonde had to laugh out loud. &quot;They&#39;re 
not awful. In fact, they&#39;re my new back-up singers now. They have 
wonderful voices.&quot;

&quot;Heh...&quot; Makoto&#39;s nose crinkled as he made a face. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t say 
that if you heard them practicing day in and day out, Aino-san. Trust 
me, I&#39;m growing deaf from listening to them.&quot; Of course he was grinning 
when he said this to show that he was only kidding around.

Suddenly a noise caught both of their attentions and they turned around 
to see the Three Lights hurrying towards them. &quot;Oooooooi! Mako-chan! We 
made it, we made it!&quot; Yaten yelled out exuberantly. Minako stepped aside 
as Seiya and Yaten gathered Makoto in their arms for a fierce group hug. 
Taiki approached them at a mellower pace and thus, was the first of the 
three siblings to notice the blonde&#39;s presence.

&quot;Good afternoon Aino-sempai.&quot; He greeted her.

&quot;Hi.&quot; Minako greeted back. Before she could open her mouth to speak, she 
heard someone call her name.

&quot;Minako-chan!&quot; Michiru briskly walked towards her and dragged her away 
from the others. &quot;What kind of stunt did you just pull? You didn&#39;t even 
wait for the rest of us to evaluate them.&quot; She told Minako harshly.

&quot;But they were great singers weren&#39;t they?&quot; The other girl defended and 
glared back at her manager. &quot;Don&#39;t make such a big deal about it.&quot;

Michiru took a deep breath before expelling it slowly and calmly. She 
pursed her lips in disapproval before quietly relenting, &quot;Fine, 
Minako-chan. They were good. But don&#39;t make hasty decisions like that 
without our feedback again.&quot;

&quot;Of course Kaioh-san...&quot; Minako quirked her lips slightly, relieved to 
be let off the hook.

&quot;Now let&#39;s go back and you can personally thank the rest of the people 
for coming, and bid them good bye.&quot; The older woman went on. Minako 
wanted to refuse, but she was not stupid enough to push her luck. Her 
manager was usually a reserved and controlled woman, and she was slow to 
anger. But when she did get angry... let&#39;s just say it wasn&#39;t an 
experience Minako wanted to repeat.

&quot;Okay...&quot; She answered compliantly before following Michiru back to the 
function room. She glanced at Makoto one last time to see that he was 
being dragged away by the others with every intention to celebrate. 
Their eyes met and they both smiled sadly, feeling oddly bereft to see 
the other leaving.

There was a minute of tension-filled silence before Yaten could not keep 
it in anymore and whirled around to stare at Makoto. The other girls 
behind her all came to an abrupt halt, and looked down at her curiously. 
&quot;What... was... that?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Makoto snapped back and shifted her eyes away from the shorter 
girl&#39;s knowing scrutiny.

&quot;Yeeeeah... Hey what was that all about?&quot; Seiya, like Yaten, finally 
gave in to her needling curiosity and asked. She swung an arm around 
Makoto&#39;s shoulder in an obnoxious gesture of over familiarity.

&quot;What was WHAT about?&quot; The brunette continued to play ignorant and 
shrugged Seiya&#39;s arm away before walking ahead of them.

&quot;Oh no... Don&#39;t you run away missy!&quot; Yaten called out and walked after 
her. &quot;You and Miss Aino were making googly eyes at each other!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re delusional...&quot; Makoto barked out in laugher, but her cheeks 
started to redden at the implication. She stuffed her hands in her 
pockets and continued to storm forward. &#39;What the heck is this? I&#39;m not 
LIKE that.&#39;

Seiya and Taiki looked at each other before running after the girls. 
&quot;Hey, it&#39;s okay Mako-chan.&quot; Taiki tried to soothe. &quot;We understand.&quot;

&quot;Understand what?&quot; Makoto exclaimed, slowing down to a stop once more 
and looked at the sisters in exasperation. &quot;There&#39;s nothing to 
understand! You guys are obviously reading too much into things!&quot;

&#39;Are we?&#39; Taiki wanted to say but shrugged instead, she didn&#39;t want 
their friend to alienate them if they kept teasing and prodding her like 
this. Like Makoto, she valued her privacy and understood her reticence 
very well. But she had been wondering about what the other girl meant by 
her &#39;queer quadruplets&#39; comment this morning. But she figured she could 
talk to Makoto about it only when the time was right.

&quot;Alright, alright, forget it.&quot; She said, cutting in before the others 
could speak, &quot;This is not the time to be picking on Mako-chan. We, 
ladies, are supposed to be celebrating.&quot;

&quot;Yeah!&quot; Seiya and Yaten chorused, the current issue momentarily 
forgotten. Makoto looked at her gratefully and nodded.

They started walking again.

The brunette was glad that the conversation was over. She had been 
disturbed by the whole thing more than she cared to admit. But she 
didn&#39;t want to talk or even think about it. &#39;There&#39;s nothing to think 
about.&#39; She concluded with a small huff. &#39;Nothing at all...&#39;

Author&#39;s Note+

Ah yeah... Before anyone flames me for exaggerating Minako&#39;s negative 
aspects-- let me explain by saying that I did this deliberately for an 
effective and realistic character development that you will witness in 
future chapters. It&#39;s all planned out in my head-- everything. So um... 
You don&#39;t have to worry about me doing any characters here any 
injustice.

My description of Roppongi is as accurate as my reading about it in the 
encyclopedia. I haven&#39;t really been there yet... Kusanagi Hotel is 
obviously a figment of my imagination.

The &quot;-chama&quot; suffix is a mix of -sama and -chan. It means you are 
calling someone with affection and respect-- it is usually meant to be 
humorous. &quot;Bancho&quot; is a title that is usually referred to a gang leader. 
And you must be wondering why Taiki called Minako &#39;sempai.&#39; Well... 
Since the Lights are working for Minako now, it is only appropriate to 
call her sempai. It is used addressed to someone who is higher in the 
school or (in the Light&#39;s case) business hierarchy.

Okonomiyaki is a kind of Japanese pancake or pizza where the key 
ingredients are the sauce, the meat, the greens (usually the cabbage), 
the egg omelet-thingy and the Yakisoba (fried noodles).

... I really need a beta-reader... (weeps)

(EDITED)

Erm... Uh... I just noticed this morning when I re-read this chapter 
that I posted the unedited version. (fidgets in embarrassment) This is 
the edited chapter. I&#39;m really sorry everyone. The only major change I 
put here was the part when Minako asked Makoto to be her friend again. 
Sorry for the inconvenience.</pre>
