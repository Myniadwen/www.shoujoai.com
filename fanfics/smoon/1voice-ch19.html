<p>They were sweaty, tired, and very, very naked. Minako shivered and  Rei reached down to pull the golden sheets back over their bodies,  although their sheer body warmth was enough to dispel the initial chill.</p>
<p>It was the Venusian who broke the mood of their afterglow.</p>
<p>“Rei,  can you see anything?” She paused for a moment, her voice hitched, and  then her words came spilling out in a sudden rush. “Have you had any  premonitions? Beryl could attack at any moment. We’d be unprepared. She  could-“</p>
<p>“Maa,” the Martian moaned, “If you’re still thinking along those lines, then I didn’t do my job correctly.”</p>
<p>“Rei,” Minako warned testily, “You <em>know</em> that’s not-”</p>
<p>“Then let it go.” Rei said simply.</p>
<p>The  Martian laid a trail of wet kisses leading up from her commander’s  collarbone to her jaw line and Minako sighed and willed herself to  relax. Her body shivered as Rei dragged her nails across her ribcage,  and Minako was a little surprised to find that it was her partner who  became derailed, especially after her insistence to let the topic go.</p>
<p>“Do  you remember what I told you?” Rei’s words were hot against the hollow  of Minako’s neck. She forced herself out of that sweet spot and raised  herself on an elbow to capture her commander’s attention. “Do you  remember what we saw in my premonition of what might be our next battle  with Beryl?”</p>
<p>“Don’t hesitate.” Minako reiterated quietly.</p>
<p>“And what did I tell you about hating Beryl?”</p>
<p>“That she feeds off of it.”</p>
<p>“That’s all you have to remember.” Rei nodded and then returned to her ministrations.</p>
<p>Minako’s breath hitched in the back of her throat. “But, this could be our last night together.”</p>
<p>“Then we should spend our last moments together <em>not</em> thinking about that, shouldn’t we?” Rei’s words were muffled against Minako’s skin.</p>
<p>“Rei-“</p>
<p>“Shut up,” the Martian growled, “And let me do my job.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Positive  that her partner was asleep, Ami slipped out from between the glossy  green sheets and pulled a robe over her body to banish the goosebumps  that had spread across her skin.</p>
<p>She padded out of the bedroom  and took a seat on the edge of a couch. Leaning forward with her elbows  on her knees, she summoned her incorporeal computer into existence, and  after examining the report she had opened to the top most window, she  began tapping the keys furiously.</p>
<p>Moments later, in the blue glow  cast by her computer screen, she saw Makoto’s tall figure standing in  the bedroom doorway. Ami closed her eyes and awaited the reprimand for  working when she should be sleeping. It didn’t come in the form she’d  been expecting.</p>
<p>“This could be our last night together.” Makoto’s  voice was quiet and forlorn, so unlike the stoic warrior Ami had grown  to love.</p>
<p>The Mercurian didn’t bother to send her trusted computer  back to its incorporeal hiding spot. She rose from the couch and made a  beeline for her partner. She wrapped her arms around Makoto’s waist.</p>
<p>Ami’s  face softened, and she reached up to brush an errant brunette bang from  Makoto’s forehead. “Come on, Mako-chan, let’s get you back to bed. You  must be freezing.”</p>
<p>The Jovian’s strong hands wrapped around the  smaller woman’s upper arms and with one glance to those hazel eyes, Ami  knew she wouldn’t weasel out of this conversation.</p>
<p>“I’m not going  anywhere until you tell me what it’ll take to convince you that we’ve  done all we can to prepare for this battle.”</p>
<p>Ami’s calm façade  began to crumble. She captured her bottom lip with her front teeth and  her brow knitted. “What if there was something… something I’ve  overlooked, something I could have researched harder, something I could  have-“</p>
<p>“Stop letting the weight of an outcome of a battle we can’t predict rest on your shoulders!”</p>
<p>The  enormity of the situation pressed down on her, and the tears that Ami  had held at bay slipped from her blue eyes and raced down the curve of  her cheeks, and she surrendered her sobbing frame to the Jovian’s arms.</p>
<p>Makoto sighed and Ami closer. “We’ve done all we can,” she whispered softly, “Can’t we just <em>be</em> together, now?”</p>
<p>With one final whimper, Ami wiped away the last of her tears. She nodded, and then led her partner back to their bedroom.</p>
<hr />
<p>The  time for tears had come and gone. Michiru’s eyes were dry and  bloodshot. Haruka wore a warrior’s expression of the calm before the  storm. The two clung to each other in the room’s darkness. Somehow,  they couldn’t fight the sense that their feelings for each other were  the only thing in the universe that still made sense.</p>
<p>“You know  that if Beryl attacks tomorrow, Pluto’s plan may well fail.” The  Uranian’s voice was devoid of emotion. “She’s taken Saturn to train for  the final battle, but if Metallia is here on the Moon, then having  Saturn destroy the Earth won’t help us at all.”</p>
<p>Michiru’s hand  balled into a fist, curled tightly between their bodies. “If they  hadn’t entered another dimension, we could have contacted Setsuna to  tell her that Beryl might attack sooner than we’d thought. We didn’t  plan for this.”</p>
<p>“Saturn’s use may be delayed.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”  Haruka paused, and was momentarily on the edge between two entirely  different outcomes. Finally, her eyes hardened and her lips formed a  thin, white line. “You can’t second guess this. It wasn’t our decision  to make, anyway. Not really.”</p>
<p>Michiru propped herself up on an elbow. Her cheeks were flushed with defiance. “But Saturn’s just a <em>child</em>, Haruka! We can’t just send her off to <em>die</em>!”</p>
<p>“She’s a <em>weapon</em>, Michiru, a <em>weapon</em>! And if she won’t die destroying the Earth, then she’ll die destroying the Moon. Which would you prefer?”</p>
<p>Tears  threatened Michiru’s reddened eyes and she stifled a sob. Her arm gave  out and she found solace in the hollow of Haruka’s neck. Even her  partner’s tender reassurances and soft strokes along her back did  little to ease her fears.</p>
<p>When she could find it once more,  Michiru’s voice was a whisper. “Why do I get the feeling that we’ll be  long dead by the time that decision gets made?”</p>
<p>Haruka didn’t have an answer for her.</p>
<hr />
<p>Mars’  patrol route took her across the southern edge of the Palace grounds.  As always, she remained vigilant and alert, yet somehow, she found that  her gaze was continuously drawn back to blue orb of the Earth.</p>
<p>“Mars-sama! Mars-sama!”</p>
<p>The  Martian turned to the call of her name and found herself surrounded by  several of the Moon’s troops, men who had been assigned to stay behind  and guard the Palace and surrounding cities and towns while the  majority of their force had been sent north to fight the youma and the  human army.</p>
<p>“Mars-sama, we’ve heard that the fighting to the  north has resumed. They say that more and more Earth warriors continue  to come down off the pole. Is this true?”</p>
<p>Summoning her inner  Priestess, the crimson warrior raised a hand, palm outwards, and  answered calmly, though she felt far from it. “This is true,” she  replied, “Humans and youma continue to reinforce the resistance from  Earth, but our forces are holding the line and are allowing no quarter.”</p>
<p>A young man, not nearly older than sixteen, balled a determined fist near his chest. “But we could be <em>there</em>, aiding our brothers on the battlefield with our swords instead of walking the palace grounds, uselessly!”</p>
<p>“It’s not useless!”</p>
<p>The  men recoiled. The senshi of Mars was known to have polar opposite  reactions in response to different criteria that ranged from eerily  calm to savagely vicious, and there were even tales of a fiercely  possessive side to the crimson warrior. It was clear that these men  feared for themselves for having invoked her wrath and Mars could see  it in their wild eyes as she struggled to tamp down her ire.</p>
<p>“Your  posts guarding the Palace are increasingly important,” she said as  calmly as possible, “The northern plains will not be the only front  this war will be fought on.”</p>
<p>She looked at the blonde youth, so  hungry for battle, with a wistful smile. “Do not be too eager to lay  your life on the line. A warrior’s sense of patience and knowledge of  when his skills are needed are as valued as the experienced veteran who  has a use in every scenario.”</p>
<p>“Mars-sama,” another of the group  spoke tentatively, and when he was graced with a nod from the Martian,  he found the courage to continue, “Are you saying that another attack  is imminent?”</p>
<p>Amethyst eyes found themselves drifting back to the  large, blue orb of the Earth. “I’m saying that anything is a  possibility, and that a good warrior is always at the ready.”</p>
<p>She  frowned slightly then, for even considering how far away she was from  the Earth, Mars could see a darkening storm swirling in the planet’s  upper atmosphere, threatening to envelop the island nation of Nippon,  the nation Queen Beryl reigned from.</p>
<p>She had to force herself to turn back to the soldiers in front of her. “Do I make myself clear?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!” They all snapped to attention.</p>
<p>“Then you are dismissed.” She said curtly.</p>
<p>They bowed and turned their backs on her, returning their posts. In Mars’ mind, she called out to them pleadingly.</p>
<p>’<em>Run, you young fools. </em>Run!<em>’</em></p>
<p>She  cut her gaze back to the growing storm on Earth, dark and roiling and  punctuated with powerful lightening. It had seemed to swallow Nippon,  billowing out, spreading, covering the mainland across the ocean, and  enshrouding those other large countries in darkness.</p>
<p>Mars raised her wrist numbly. Bringing her communicator to her lips, she hailed her leader.</p>
<p>“Venus.”</p>
<p>A moment later, Minako responded. “Mars.”</p>
<p>“Are the Queen and the Princess secured in their bunkers?” Mars asked.</p>
<p>“Of  course they are.” Minako’s reply was hasty, but her voice dropped off  and the bustle of the Moon’s tacticians was the only noise across the  transmission for one, brief moment.</p>
<p>“Rei?”</p>
<p>Mars swallowed a lump in her threat. “Alert the others.” She said. “Beryl’s on her way.”</p>
<hr />
<p>The  proverbial calm before the storm found the seven senshi silently  waiting at the Moon Palace’s southern most battlements. Thousands of  troops, mostly warriors from the Moon’s army, fell into loose  formations behind them.</p>
<p>Emergency bulletins had been posted. In  response, the surrounding cities and towns had erupted into frantic  activity, but emergency plans had been well rehearsed and within the  hour, the citizens that lived in the immediate vicinity of the Palace  had been safely ushered into underground bunkers and safe houses. Power  supplies and explosive gasses had been disabled to reduce the  possibility of fires or explosions, and the main thoroughfares had been  cleared of vehicles and other obstacles.</p>
<p>It went unspoken between the seven women that those efforts might well have been useless.</p>
<p>In  relation to the sunspot activity, where great arcs flaring from the Sun  could be seen from even the Moon’s surface, the ground was already  trembling beneath their feet. Electrically charged storms were rolling  in from the west. Even if the underground bunkers held strong through  the earthquakes that were sure were to come, if anyone survived the  battle, there might be little left of the cities and Palace to return  to at all.</p>
<p>A growing, demonic cloud that raced across the  emptiness of space between the Earth and the Moon did little to  reassure them that their efforts were not in vain. It seemed as though  Metallia was delivering Beryl’s front personally.</p>
<p>Carried on a  dark, menacing cloud equipped with hungry teeth and beady eyes,  thousands of youma were supported on this vehicle of destruction.  Doubtlessly, given the wide berth the monsters gave the cloud’s center,  Beryl and her Shittenou had hitched a ride on it as well.</p>
<p>Before  the warriors of the Moon had realized it, the youma had hit the ground  and were rushing the streets and clogging the thoroughfares. They  wasted no time in heading straight for the Palace.</p>
<p>Staring down  the sheer walls of the Palace, blankly watching the approaching  monsters, Venus waited for Mercury to calculate the exact distance of  their foe. When the small woman tapped her on the shoulder, the leader  of the inner senshi raised a hand above her head and then tightened it  into a fist to signal the first attack.</p>
<p>The small Mercurian force  they had kept from the main front launched its offensive, and laser  guided missiles launched forth from their vantage points high on the  upper tiers of the western edge of the Palace. The screaming weapons  shattered buildings and ate the streets below them, but they also took  hundreds of the youma down with every strike. The troops rejoiced at  the sight; the young men issued hearty whooping yells and commented  grandly to their comrades.</p>
<p>The senshi remained tentatively quiet.</p>
<p>Jupiter  spun on her heel and squinted hazel eyes as she looked up to the  battlements that hosted the force responsible for slowing the youma’s  progress. She started to shout to the Mercurians, to warn them, but  knew it was already too late.</p>
<p>The ground surged beneath their  feet. A fissure that started a kilometer away ran down the length of  the main street outside the Palace walls and rapidly cracked the ground  in front of it. The fault ran along the center of the street, hit the  southwest corner of the Palace wall, and didn’t even slow down for the  thick, limestone walls.</p>
<p>“It’s not going to hold.” Jupiter’s voice  was lost to the cracking and groaning of the Palace as its western side  separated slightly from its adjoining walls, and then sheered off all  together. In a landslide effect, the top six stories of the Palace slid  down. Taking the Mercurians with it, rubble spilled over the retaining  walls, crushing the streets, homes, and shops of the city below.</p>
<p>A  strained hush fell over the warriors of the Moon, even as the youma  picked up their pace once again. Mars was the first to break the  frightened trance. With a draw and a snap, one, lone fire-arrow flew  from her bow, arced through the darkening sky, and slammed into the  thick neck of a youma far below.</p>
<p>A volley of metal arrows  followed. Archers spread across other battlements let loose their  weapons, and the rest of the senshi aided the onslaught with elemental  attacks designed to take out as many of the monsters at once as  possible.</p>
<p>Buildings fell. Youma were crushed. The ground at  Uranus’ disposal buried the monsters. Mars’ fire ignited their bodies  and Jupiter’s electricity charred them. The waters of Neptune and  Mercury drowned them and Venus’ light blinded them.</p>
<p>But the youma would not be slowed.</p>
<p>Scrambling  over their dead and surging forward, even with the sizeable dent the  senshi had made in their ranks, the monsters made it to the Palace  Gates and, moments later, flooded into the Palace proper.</p>
<p>Venus  led the next charge. Dashing from the southern walls, she raced down  the battlement stairs that would take her to the ground level at the  rear of the Palace. Her warriors at her heels, the seven of them met  the youma; the creatures had broken through the Palace’s front and  streamed out its rear. They didn’t care for any of the riches or wealth  that the old castle had to offer. They cared only for the senshi, and  those warriors knew it.</p>
<p>They took up battle ready positions under  the thick canopy of an old oak tree, and the Moon’s troops filed into  place behind them uncertainly. A distant clap of thunder shook the  northern edge of the palace walls to their left. To their right, where  the Sea of Serenity sparkled dimly, a hazy lightening storm drifted in  from the sky above the water.</p>
<p>The crimson warrior pressed herself  to Venus’ back and the Venusian chanced a glance at the Martian over  her shoulder. Mars nodded. The golden warrior hung her head. They were  in the same location as they had been Rei’s visions.</p>
<p>“This place will look entirely different all too soon.” Venus said.</p>
<p>“You know what to do.” Mars said softly. “You’ve seen it. You can <em>change </em>it.”</p>
<p>Unnerved  by the silent monsters that surrounded them on all sides and milled  around the open edges of the courtyard, spilling out of the Palace with  no end in sight, Uranus initiated the first attack. It blew a hole in  the Palace wall and a dozen of the youma were taken out along with it.</p>
<p>But their brethren did not react and only stood there, dumbly drooling, refusing to attack.</p>
<p>“What are they waiting for?” Uranus barked.</p>
<p>The  sound of high heels and dress boots was accompanied by a grating laugh  that could only belong to one person. At once, the senshi felt their  hackles rise, and somehow, the laugh of one human woman, avatar of a  dark power, could be many times more frightening that even the  monstrous youma they’d been battling for far too long.</p>
<p>From  hallways that had once been filled with light and laughter, Beryl  strode through darkness before being greeted by the hazy, filtered  sunlight of the courtyard. Lightening shot across the darkening sky and  its blue-white light illuminated the stiff form of Endymion on her arm  and the shittenou that trailed along closely behind them.</p>
<p>The  youma parted without verbal command and several paces away from each  other, the humans met the senshi in the middle of the courtyard, around  the old oak tree. The silence was oppressive, but Beryl had no qualms  with breeching it.</p>
<p>“Your Queen and Princess. Where are they?”</p>
<p>Uranus’ building anger was thinly veiled. “We’ll never tell you!”</p>
<p>The Queen of the Earth turned toward the tall blonde and chuckled. “I warn you now. Even you <em>outer</em> senshi stand no chance against me. You’ve fought my youma and you’ve  fought my human army. The two combined are nothing compared to the  power Metallia has invested in me.”</p>
<p>“Why warn us, you witch?” Uranus demanded.</p>
<p>Mars stepped closer to Venus and whispered softly to her partner. “She doesn’t want to do this.”</p>
<p>Venus nodded. “Endymion… it’s her love for him. She wants to spare him… she wants one of <em>us</em> to spare him because she <em>can’t</em>!”</p>
<p>Beryl’s  jaw clacked shut. Her dark eyes seemed to harden and they cut to Venus.  “You think you know everything, little girl?” She sneered. “You were <em>never</em> a match for me. If you won’t tell me where the leaders of this sorry  little satellite are, trust me when I say I’ll find them by myself!”</p>
<p>With  no further recourse, Venus’ sword slid from its sheath with a scream  and she launched herself at Beryl, but it was Endymion’s sword that met  Venus’ blade.</p>
<p>Beryl laughed and waved her hand. “You four,” she  gestured to the shittenou, “Take care of the senshi. Show them what  powers Metallia has granted you,” she growled, “But leave Venus to <em>me</em>!”</p>
<p>The  shittenou complied mechanically. They lunged forward and this seemed to  be the cue the youma had been waiting for, and the ugly creatures  wasted no time in launching themselves into the fray.</p>
<p>The troops  of the Moon Kingdom took to their previously ordered commands and drew  the youma attacks at themselves as the inner senshi rushed forward to  meet the shittenou with reckless abandon. Meanwhile, the two outer  senshi hurried to disengage Endymion from Venus.</p>
<p>Uranus’ talisman  added untold strength alongside Venus’ blade and the exiled Prince  stumbled backwards. Uranus was quick to press her offensive on the  human as Venus caught her breath and Neptune’s attention.</p>
<p>“Take it easy on him.” Venus said. Neptune nodded and the leader of the senshi turned to meet Beryl.</p>
<p>The  Queen of the Earth stood calmly, a long, thin sword of glistening black  metal, all too similar to the one that had controlled Mars not long ago  enough, was held loosely in Beryl’s grip.</p>
<p>“You think you can win my favor with that little stunt?”</p>
<p>“I don’t <em>need</em> any favors from you, Beryl.”</p>
<p>The human found this funny and laughed as she slowly circled Venus’ defensive stance. “That’s good, little girl, because <em>Beryl </em>is no more.”</p>
<p>Venus smirked and launched herself at the human woman.</p>
<p>OOO</p>
<p>“It would <em>have</em> to be you two.” Mars said with an amused, lopsided grin.</p>
<p>The humor took Nephrite off guard. “We’re going to get you back for that ambush back on Earth, you little bitch!”</p>
<p>“Ambush?”  Mars asked as she parried Nephrite’s furious blows and shot a burning  mandala at Kunzite. “And here I thought that’s what you two tried to do  to <em>me</em>!”</p>
<p>The crimson warrior met a rapid series of barely  controlled swings with quick parries and a savage smile. “Besides, I  think the only <em>bitch</em> here is <em>you</em>.”</p>
<p>Nephrite’s eye  twitched. He raised his arms high, aiming for Mars’ head. Mars dropped  her weight to her thighs and stepped into the attack, narrowly avoiding  his swing while piercing him through the solar plexus with her blade.  As he slid down her sword, Nephrite looked to the Martian with empty  eyes.</p>
<p>“I should have done that the first time.” The crimson  warrior spat before kicking the young shittenou’s convulsing body off  her blade.</p>
<p>She then turned to Kunzite’s charred but quickly  recovering form, and she offered him a poorly disguised grin. “I  thought Metallia gave you some impressive new powers.” She taunted.</p>
<p>“Oh, she did. She gave <em>me</em> impressive new powers,” Kunzite smiled flatly, “Not Nephrite. <em>He</em> was just the decoy.”</p>
<p>The  crimson warrior raised an eyebrow, but before she could blink, Kunzite  was on her, pushing her back with a barely controlled strength and  speed she found she could barely keep up with.</p>
<p>OOO</p>
<p>“You’re not fighting him.” Neptune said simply as she skirted Endymion’s form.</p>
<p>Uranus parried a stiff blow. “I can’t bring myself to kill the guy.”</p>
<p>“You’re with Venus then? What, do you think Serenity can save him? Do you think she can save all of us?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know <em>what</em> Venus thinks.” The Uranian pushed against Endymion’s sword so that he  skittered backwards on his heels before she addressed her partner  flatly. “I don’t <em>know</em> what to think anymore, Michiru.”</p>
<p>Neptune pressed her lips into a thin, white line and parried Endymion’s next attack.</p>
<p>OOO</p>
<p>“Normally,  I would have created some great new weapon, or some sneaky  psychological devise,” Zoicite explained as he made several passing  blows in the Mercurian’s direction that were just barely blocked, “But  thanks to Metallia, I’ve learned that brute force can be <em>quite</em> enjoyable as well.”</p>
<p>Mercury’s  strength gave out and she collapsed to the ground, but she did so  gracefully, rolling backwards to relative safety before jumping back to  her feet fluidly. She gritted her teeth. Her hand-eye coordination was  excellent, but she didn’t have the strength to continue to meet  Zoicite’s powerful, fast attacks. She summoned her blue visor. She  needed a strategy. Even with Metallia’s influence, he was sure to have  a weak point.</p>
<p>In the time it took for the blue-tinged display to  flicker to life, she stole a glance to her right. Jupiter was busily  defending against Jadeite’s quick sword attacks. For all that he may  have been the youngest of the shittenou, he seemed to have been granted  the most of Metallia’s favor and it was clear that the Jovian was  barely holding her ground against his quick movements.</p>
<p>She forced  herself to focus on her own foe. Points of light exploded before her  eyes and her visor’s software was quick to scan her attacker’s body  even as Zoicite launched himself in her direction, his feet pounding  the paver ground as he closed the distance between them. Mercury’s  cobalt eyes narrowed as she scanned her readout for anything of use.</p>
<p>“There!” She exclaimed. She turned to Jupiter. “Mako-chan, aim for the-“</p>
<p>She  hadn’t been nearly quick enough. Before she could relay the necessary  information, Zoicite had speared Mercury with his sword, driving his  blade through the small woman’s center and not stopping until his hilt  had slammed into her abdomen.</p>
<p>Zoicite found his nose nestled into  the Mercurian’s short hair. His frame shook. His hands released the  hilt of his sword. But his dark, confused eyes stared only at the blank  expression of the woman in front of him. Mercury’s expression was  neutral. She refused to look down, knowing what had happened but  reluctant to admit it. Her gloved hands found the sword’s hilt and she  collapsed to her knees, a trickle of blood spilling from the corner of  her mouth.</p>
<p>She turned to where she last remembered seeing  Jupiter. The Jovian’s back was turned to her. Jadeite seemed to have  eased up on his attack, but perhaps that’s because his attention was on <em>her</em>, seemingly as surprised by Mercury’s injury as her attacker had been.</p>
<p>’<em>They didn’t want to do this.’</em> Mercury realized.</p>
<p>That  was when Jupiter’s footwork had turned her position, and what she saw  when she chanced a glance in her partner’s direction froze her.</p>
<p>Mercury’s  expression finally registered emotion. Her brows furrowed. Her eyes  narrowed. If she didn’t react quickly, Jupiter would be too late to  defend against Jadeite. The youngest shittenou was already making a  move for her.</p>
<p>“Aim for the left of his chest!” She cried, choking on a thick, coppery taste of blood.</p>
<p>The  Jovian’s numb form didn’t move. Not until Jadeite’s sword slid through  upper left arm and tore itself free. The arm fell limp and useless,  hanging by only muscle and tendon. It was the only thing that snapped  Jupiter out of her daze, the only thing that could make her pull her  attention from the image of her lover, crumpled to her knees, a sword  protruding from her stomach.</p>
<p>She turned then. The sword she had  been holding limply fell from her fingers and clattered to the ground.  Jadeite’s confident expression slipped. Jupiter rushed forward. The  shittenou had gauged her speed. His sword impaled her left shoulder,  but not before she’d balled her right hand into a tight fist and sent  every last ounce of her strength into a punch to the man’s chest.</p>
<p>She  felt it under her knuckles. It was small, and hard, and of irregular  shape. Her first sent a stone that had laid against Jadeite’s  collarbone into his chest cavity, where it shattered under the pressure.</p>
<p>The  young shittenou released his hold on the blade that had impaled his  victim’s shoulder and stumbled backwards, his hands splayed over the  hole in his chest, as though he could contain the sickly green light  that tried to creep out of it.</p>
<p>Then, he imploded into a single point of light. The remnants of the stone fell to the ground, pebbles at Jupiter’s feet.</p>
<p>Blood  ran down the Jovian’s arm. It was hot. But she didn’t bother to remove  the blade stuck through her shoulder. She was losing blood at an  alarming rate, and as Zoicite found his shaky legs and turned towards  her with a wavering expression, she knew what she had to do.</p>
<p>She  turned to Mercury. Already, she had fallen, rolling on her side to  avoid falling further on the blade. Even above the din of battle,  Jupiter could hear her failing breaths.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.” Jupiter whispered.</p>
<p>Zoicite  charged her then, and Jupiter stood her ground. She could have laughed.  She could have considered the shittenou unoriginal for delivering the  same blow to her that he had served to her dying lover, but the humor  was beyond her and Jupiter wrapped strong arms around Zoicite’s slender  frame, even as his blade pierced her stomach.</p>
<p>“No…” She could  hear Mercury’s dying breath, even as she summoned every last bit of  power Jupiter had invested in her, and she learned first hand what it  was like to be electrocuted alive.</p>
<p>One crispy body hit the ground alongside her fallen comrade, and a handful of crushed stone was lifted away on the wind.</p>
<p>OOO</p>
<p>In  the battle being waged between the youma and the troops of the Moon  Kingdom, the two forces had nearly extinguished themselves so that  there were few left standing. Already, the nightmare battlefield had  come to closely resemble the one in Rei’s vision. The basalt pavers of  the courtyard were torn and broken; the marble walls of the palace were  shattered and toppled. The ancient oak which the Martian had sought  solace under so many times was charred and blackened. The bodies that  lie in the courtyard, amidst jagged chunks of stone and upturned  concrete were of the countless dead; humans, youma, Lunarian, and even  senshi.</p>
<p>Their blood mingled. And it wasn’t nearly over.</p>
<p>Above  the din of battle and the elemental blasts of the senshi that were left  standing, a low rumbling gradually increased. The dusky skies darkened  further and arcs of lightening forked across the sky. The limestone  turrets and battlements of the palace were no barrier to its power, and  falling rubble crashed to the ground, joining the heaps of debris  wrought by the earthquakes. Some of it could have been the effect of  the raging sun. Some of it could have been the after-effect of  Jupiter’s rage.</p>
<p>“Two down.” Uranus said. “Two senshi. Two  shitennou.” She and Neptune stood across from Endymion, both parties  leveling swords at each other, but each taking a breather before  further attacks.</p>
<p>Neptune acknowledged the loss. “Mars and Venus know, too.”</p>
<p>The Uranian narrowed her eyes at Endymion. “Do you think he carries a stone too?”</p>
<p>Neptune’s eyes hardened. “Perhaps. The left breast pocket?”</p>
<p>Uranus  nodded. Neptune skirted forward, locking blades with Endymion as the  senshi of the wind rushed behind her, driving the hilt of her sword  into his chest.</p>
<p>Endymion groaned and stumbled backwards. He fell  to his knees and his hand shot to the inside of his jacket where he  rummaged for a frantic moment before pulling a crushed heap of plastic  from his pocket. A communicator.</p>
<p>The Uranian nearly laughed. “Even now, Serenity protects what is hers.”</p>
<p>Neptune smiled fondly. “Even still, he has no stone. That must mean that Metallia’s taint touches him directly.”</p>
<p>The  King of the Earth turned the broken remains of the communicator in his  palm, his dark eyes narrowing at the destroyed device that seemed so  familiar, so important.</p>
<p>“Look,” Neptune said, “He’s trying to fight it. He’s been trying all this time.”</p>
<p>Endymion  dropped the plastic shards and seemed to shake himself from his trance.  Uranus adjusted her grip on her sword. “Mars?” She asked. “Does she  know the shitennou’s weak point?”</p>
<p>“She knows. She’s already trying.”</p>
<p>OOO</p>
<p>Mars  pushed an offensive she knew she didn’t really have. Kunzite was  humoring her. For every thrust, every strike that was issued, he would  quickly calculate the projection of her blows and easily parry them.</p>
<p>“Ah,  ah, Mars. I won’t be taken down as easily as them,” he sneered as he  parried another blow, “The stone I hold is much more powerful than  theirs.”</p>
<p>“But it’s not enough to keep me at bay, and yet Beryl-“</p>
<p>“Don’t presume to understand our Queen’s intentions, you barbarian.”</p>
<p>Mars smirked. “But still, she must have much more power than the likes of you, and yet Minako is still holding her back.”</p>
<p>Kunzite snorted. “Martians and their one track minds. That little Venusian will be the death of you, you know.”</p>
<p>Amethyst eyes hardened. “I <em>do</em> know. And I’m <em>fine</em> with that.”</p>
<p>This  courageous declaration seemed to derail the leader of the shittenou and  the Martian landed a lucky hit to Kunzite’s left shoulder, just above  his breast. With his jacket slashed open and blood spilling from the  wound, Kunzite teetered backwards. His hands rested over his breast  protectively.</p>
<p>“I’m done playing with you,” he snarled, “I’m glad you can be content with your death.”</p>
<p>He  lunged forward then. Mars saw it coming, but knew she didn’t have the  speed to block or dodge. It was a graceful, swinging arc that came down  from the lightening filled sky and buried itself between her neck and  shoulder.</p>
<p>Kunzite grinned victoriously and in a vicious swipe, he  pulled his sword free from the cavity he’d created in the crimson  warrior’s chest.</p>
<p>Mars stood on teetering legs and the leader of the shittenou turned his back to her.</p>
<p>“Venus won’t be far behind you, Mars,” he spat, “I’ll see to it personally.”</p>
<p>“That’s what you think, you son of a bitch.”</p>
<p>The  voice was hoarse and raspy and filled with liquid, and somehow, it was  right in his ear. But before he could turn, Kunzite felt slender arms  wrap around his chest. Two searching palms splayed open across the lump  hidden above his left breast, and then, his word was ignited in flames  that refused to be extinguished. He was incinerated from the inside out  and the stone he held turned to glass and shattered from the scalding  flames.</p>
<p>Without the shittenou’s body as support, Mars’ charred and bloodied body crashed to the ground.</p>
<p>OOO</p>
<p>“Well, I’m sure this wasn’t <em>quite</em> as you’d planned it, now is it, Venus?” Beryl asked with no small amount of amusement.</p>
<p>Even as she parried Beryl’s next blow, Venus’ cast a glance to her fallen lover and she suppressed a shudder.<em> ‘So </em>this<em> is what distracted me.’ </em></p>
<p>She’d  felt the lives of Mercury and Jupiter slip away, and though she had  mourned their loss, she had not faltered in her attack and defense  against her opponent.</p>
<p>But this was different.</p>
<p>A crimson  warmth she could only associate with Rei slipped through the cracks of  her fingers and she was left with one disembodied thought that could  belong only to her lover.</p>
<p>’<em>Don’t hesitate!’</em></p>
<p>“You’re getting <em>slow</em>, Venus. Do you need a break?” Beryl taunted.</p>
<p>Venus’  body shuddered again. She felt the wounds along her ribcage where she’d  been pierced by Beryl’s long blade repeatedly open and close with every  breath. The pain was excruciating, especially when she could compare it  to the two or three gashes she’d scored against the Queen of the Earth,  no more than flesh wounds that scratched the surface of Beryl’s arms.</p>
<p>Venus’ eyes narrowed as the last of Rei’s aura slipped through her fingers and she finally turned her gaze back to Beryl.</p>
<p>”<em>I’m sorry, Rei. I only hope you’ll forgive me.’</em></p>
<p>“Bring it.” She growled.</p>
<p>’<em>Pluto and Saturn are our only hope now.’</em></p>
<p>The  human woman smirked. She shifted her weight to a rear leg and held her  sword before her. She came so fast that the Venusian thought she flew.  The golden warrior watched that long blade come within range and she  didn’t block it, for if she did, she knew she’d never have the chance  to get within striking distance.</p>
<p>’<em>I </em>had<em> to hesitate, Rei.’</em></p>
<p>The  dark sword that slid through Venus’ stomach was freezing cold, but when  she felt her opponent impale herself on her own blade that she’d held  before her at the last second, she felt an irrepressible surge of  warmth, even as she tamped down her intense hate for this woman who had  toyed with and ultimately taken away everything she held dear.</p>
<p>Beryl looked down to the space between their bodies. Four hands, two hilts, and so much blood.</p>
<p>“Rei told me I wasn’t allowed to hate you,” Beryl could feel Venus’ distant, raspy chuckle, “But I’m not as strong as she is.”</p>
<p>Venus  tapped into the last of her strength and pushed herself forward,  ramming the hilt of her blade further into Beryl’s stomach. Beryl’s  legs gave out underneath her and both women collapsed to the ground  with gasping breaths.</p>
<p>Beryl watched as Venus drew her last  breath. Lightening flickered in the dark sky, illuminating the handful  of youma and Lunarian forces still battling to the death. Soon, it  would be a net-net zero, but for the civilians that lay in hiding. She  could feel the blood spilling from her stomach. Somewhere during her  fall to the ground, Venus’ blade had been dislodged from her body. Not  sensing the dark power that had guided her for so long, she felt  abandoned, but somehow, she felt <em>free</em>.</p>
<p>OOO</p>
<p>“Venus…”  In Uranus’ moment of distraction, her eyes turned to the golden  warrior’s body, and Endymion pressed his advantage. He stepped forward  into the opening, but it was his fist that slammed into the back of the  Uranian’s head, and not his blade. He dispatched Neptune just as easily  and it was evident that Metallia’s power within him, although not at  his disposal to its intensity, <em>could</em> be controlled when needed, for he had not killed them.</p>
<p>Beryl  heard him before she saw him, and somehow, his rough parody of help  only made things worse. Clumsy hands rolled her from her side to her  back. Her head rested on the broken paver ground and Beryl looked up  into dark, clouded eyes that stared at her, but didn’t <em>see</em> her.</p>
<p>“This isn’t you, Endymion. It was never you.”</p>
<p>He didn’t respond, but she didn’t expect that he would. <em>’Was it worth it?’</em> She wondered, as her vision faded to darkness. <em>’It can’t really end this way, can it? Not after all I’ve sacrificed. Where is Metallia?’</em></p>
<p>’<em>When all is said and done, where is Metallia </em>now<em>?’</em></p>
<p>She felt herself slipping through the cracks, and then, there was darkness.</p>

<p>Author’s Notes:</p>
<p>I  know this chapter was a little… gruesome. I didn’t shy away from  description of deaths or injuries. That said, ASV is almost over!  Please review!</p>
<p>Special Thanks:</p>
<p>E A Simpson: Evil!Minako and Rei <em>would</em> have been nice. And fun to write. And just as cool as Evil!Haruka and Michiru from the last season. Maybe you should write it.<br />
  Mels: I will be the first fan of your epic. I will!<br />
  LicketySplat:  I very much appreciate your constructive criticism! I’d say that I  clipped the battle of the last chapter for several reasons. I felt that  if I allowed it go get too long, many readers would be bored. Battles  are sort of a side dish, and I never like to make them the main focus  (although this and next chapter will be the exception, since it is the  last battle). I do agree that the dialogue in the last chapter could  have been a little better, but perhaps I felt that the situation was  becoming so dire that witty commentary might have been hard for the  characters to come by. That said, I hope that this chapter was more to  your liking.</p>
<p>OOO</p>
<p>Preview, Chapter 20: Into the Darkness</p>
<p>“It’s over!”</p>
<p>Serenity  was pushed aside by cheering men and women, dancing and jumping and  slapping hands. The Princess of the Moon kingdom felt her lips tug  upwards in a tentative smile at the hope she felt, but then she paused.</p>
<p>She  felt it under her feet. A gentle rumble; a precursor to a quake. She  looked up to the cracks that splintered across the concrete ceiling,  ripped apart slowly by earlier tremors. Her blue eyes shot back to the  screen that displayed the Queen of the Earth, who, for all intents and  purposes, <em>looked</em> very, very dead…</p>
<p>But the rumbling grew  stronger. Bits of dust and small fragments of concrete fell from the  compromised ceiling. Serenity’s voice was a raspy whisper.</p>
<p>“It’s not over. It’s not over!”</p>
<p>She  wasn’t heard over the din of the celebration, and she doubted the  others could even feel the beginnings of the quake. She thought of her  friends, all of her personal protectors, already dead. She had cried  harder than she had ever cried in her life, but now, the time for tears  was over. She looked back to the tacticians, to her <em>people</em>, to the citizens she was supposed to protect. They were swarming her mother, congratulating the Queen.</p>
<p>‘<em>They’ll never listen to me… I have to get out there and help, any way I can!’ </em></p>
<p>With  a plastic smile, the Princess of the Moon edged her way backwards  slowly. People bumped their way around her, not even noticing her slow  retreat over the din of excitement and celebration. Finally, she found  the room’s door, turned the knob, and opened the heavy, steel door only  wide enough to slip her slender body through before shutting it behind  her quietly.</p>
<p>In the dusty hallway, Serenity kicked off her heeled  dress shoes, bunched the ends of her white dress in her hands, and  sprinted up the many flights of concrete steps as fast as she could,  her golden pigtails streaming behind her.</p>
