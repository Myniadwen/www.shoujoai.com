<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So  horny…</em></span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Static fizzes,  before clearing to show us that the Senshi are lounging at the beach…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ahh!” Minako  sighed as she stretched out on her towel, “This was <em>such</em> a  good idea!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmm...” Rei agreed  as she turned the page of her book. She was relaxing in the shade of  her parasol, her long raven hair piled up on her head, held secure by  a crimson clip.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And Mako-chan  brought these cookies!” Haruka grinned, grabbing more of said  cookies and munching on them with enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, Haruka-san!”  Makoto blushed, scratching the back of her head nervously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What can I get for  ten dollars?” A sweet voice asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The four Senshi turned  their attention to where the voice sounded, shocked to see Michiru,  Ami, and Setsuna draped over Usagi, who was waving a ten dollar bill.  To make matters worse (or better) they were all dressed in…minimal  swimwear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anything you want…”  Ami purred seductively as she trailed a finger down Usagi's jaw.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Anything?</em>”  Usagi said, waggling her eyebrows suggestively.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Anything!</em>”  the four of them cheered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“ <em>Oh! So Horny!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Oh, oh so Horny!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Oh, so horny we love  you long time!!</em>” they sang.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei's jaw had dropped  and a trickle of blood ran down her nose as her left eye was caught  in a continuous twitch.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako just stared at  Setsuna as a trail of drool ran down her open mouth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was a dull thump  as Makoto fainted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Haruka simply grinned  and patted the spot next to her. Michiru happily sat down, the aqua  haired beauty practically purring as Haruka rubbed her head and fed  her a cookie.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi strolled over to  the slightly brain-dead Rei. Using her index finger, Usagi closed the  miko's mouth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei, sweetie,” she  purred. “You'll catch flies like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With that, the blonde  turned on her heeled and skipped away. Rei's eye twitched once more,  before she stood in a daze and followed the moon princess.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami cradled Makoto's  head in her lap, blushing slightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What on</em> Earth <em>possessed me to do that?</em> the blue haired genius thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto's eyes fluttered  open and she blinked dazed green eyes at Ami.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So,” Makoto  started, grinning lecherously, “<em>anything</em> I want huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami blushed and shot to  her feet, throwing Mako-chan's head off of her lap.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Makoto!” she  wailed, holding her enflamed cheeks. Ami blushed harder when she  heard the brunette chef's laughs, even when Makoto was face flat in  the sand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Setsuna sat down next  to Minako. “Hey, Mina-chan,” she whispered. “How about we…”  She began to whisper into the Senshi of Love's ear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako jumped to her  feet and stared at Setsuna, a serious frown on her pretty face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minako?” Setsuna  asked, brushing a lock of green hair behind her ear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mina-chan said nothing,  only clapped her hands together and, like a magician, pulled a  Love-Me-Chain out of thin air.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Setsuna blinked at the  chain of hearts in confusion. “What's that for?” she asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako grinned a grin  similar to that of the Cheshire Cat. “For what I have in mind babe,  it includes me, you, black leather, and a <strong><em>whole</em></strong> lotta <strong>this.</strong>” She snapped the chain in her hands, satisfied to hear  a loud <em>crack!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh…OH!” Setsuna  smiled from ear to ear. Minako wrapped the chain around the Senshi of  Time and began to drag her to the nearest beach house. Setsuna  flashed her thumbs up and mouthed, Yes!'</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto (who had removed  her face from the sand) and Ami blushed while Haruka and Michiru held  up a Go Sets-chan!' sign, silently cheering on their friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Static fizzes and  the screen goes blank.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ramblings: Yes, I  blushed while I was typing this in. blushes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My favorite line was  Minako's. Honestly, I had fun making her that perverted. Hehehe….</span></p>
