<h1>Mistaken Assumption (part 5 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/immeblue.html">Immeblue</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/misass-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>The next day Ami sat in a caf&eacute; and connected to its network, she had 
two  hours till her next class and intended to go over the material 
before  arriving.  In the middle of going over the online diagram of 
the respiratory  system an IM obstructed her view.  She was astonished 
when she saw it was  from Nature Girl.  

Ami hesitated to answer thinking this was just another way to allow Nat 
to  hurt her.  Her fingers, her heart, were itching to reply but her 
mind got  the best of her.  Only the curiosity to finally know the 
reason for Nat&#39;s  absence sent her fingers flying over the keyboard.  

Azure: where have you been?  

Nature Girl: no &#145;hi&#39;?  

Azure: do you think you deserve one?  

Nature Girl: I guess not  

Azure: you guessed right.  

Nature Girl: I&#39;m sorry I haven&#39;t talked to you in over a month.    

Ami waited for more, not believing that was all Nat had to say.  But 
was  forced to speak when it became clear Nat wasn&#39;t giving anything 
away.    

Azure: well, where have you been?  

Nature Girl: right here.    

Ami was getting decidedly annoyed at Nat&#39;s reticent responses, but 
gritted  her teeth and dealt with it.    

Azure: you&#39;ve been so busy you couldn&#39;t find time to talk to me, or 
send me  an email?  

Nature Girl: I never saw you online and only got one email. I wanted to 
talk  to you about it, that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t reply.    

&#145;One email?&#39; that didn&#39;t make sense to Ami, but she said nothing about 
it.    

Azure: why did you take so long?  

Nature Girl: to do what?  

Azure: I haven&#39;t sent you an email in over a week, why has it taken so 
long  for you to get back to me?  

Nature Girl: I only opened this email this morning.    

Ami chalked the reason for her opening the mail so late up to Nat being 
busy  and went on.  Though she ended up erasing her messages as she 
found herself  unable to answer Nat&#39;s last questions.    

Nature Girl: when would you like to meet? This weekend maybe?  

Ami didn&#39;t know how she felt about that.  There was no doubt in her 
heart  she loved this woman and she wanted to see her, but her mind was 
pushing a  different story.  Should she really go and see this woman?  
She disappears  for a month and a half without a word.  Now she&#39;s back 
and doesn&#39;t give a  clear excuse for it.  Ami couldn&#39;t let Nat just 
take her feelings for  granted.  It doesn&#39;t even look like Nat cared 
about how she felt this passed  month.  Nat didn&#39;t even show signs of 
missing her one bit.  

Ami didn&#39;t know what to do, she still loved her, but she wouldn&#39;t be 
played  for a fool.  But adhering to Makoto&#39;s advice (when she had 
woken up they  spent a few hours talking about the situation over tears 
and cherry pie) Ami  decided to give Nat the benefit of the doubt.  
&#145;You can&#39;t hide being a jerk  in person&#39; Ami hoped.  But before she 
conceded to a meeting she had to know.    

Azure: did you miss me?  

Nature Girl: I don&#39;t think I can put into words how much.  I thought of 
u  everyday u know, not a second went by that I didn&#39;t.  

Nature Girl: lol  

Azure: what&#39;s so funny?  

Nature Girl: before I met u, I never thought that statement was true.  
But I  prove it everyday. You&#39;re always on my mind.  

Nature Girl: I can only imagine how u felt.  If its half of what I felt  
missing u, I&#39;m sooo sorry.  I NEVER wanted to hurt u Azure.  I love 
you.    

&#145;She missed me,&#39; Ami knew she was lost &#145;she loves me.&#39;  There was no 
doubt  she wouldn&#39;t meet Nat now.  But common sense didn&#39;t leave her.  
They had to  meet in a crowed place, preferably one she was familiar 
with.    

Azure: this weekend is fine.  

Nature Girl: do u mind coming to Tokyo.  There&#39;s this place here where 
I&#39;ve  always wanted to meet you. lol.  You can say it is a fantasy 
even.    

&#145;Well that throws my home court advantage.  I can&#39;t say no to her 
fantasy, I  hope its crowded at least.&#39;     

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Next Saturday evening around 10pm in the nightclub next to Makoto&#39;s old 
job.    

Makoto sat at her table, the nightclub was pretty dark to begin with 
but  she was sitting at the one shrouded within shadows.  No one at the 
bar nor  entrance could see her, though she could see them.  

She was on her third glass of wine.  The last thing she wanted was to 
be  drunk when Ami got here, but she was nervous, what if Ami resented 
her.   What if she gets upset at Makoto for not telling her the truth 
from the  start and then playing this cat and mouse game.  

Makoto knew holding back the truth when she figured it out was lying.  
It  had took all her concentration not to lie any further while she 
talked to  Ami earlier in the week.  She thanked her lucky stars that 
Ami didn&#39;t ask  her to explain herself.  Makoto knew that in trying not 
to incriminate  herself she appeared cold hearted, but it had to be 
done.  She had enough to  explain to Ami already, she didn&#39;t want to 
add more lies in the mix.  

Because of her contemplation Makoto missed Ami&#39;s entrance.  She looked 
up  just in time to catch Ami openly surveying all before her.  No 
doubt looking  for the woman who wore an emerald cocktail dress with a 
pin of a pink flower  on her left shoulder.  Makoto watched as Ami 
ordered her drink and then  settle down to watch the door.  Obviously 
because she didn&#39;t find the person  she wanted in the nightclub.  

After watching Ami send the the second guy who came to her away, Makoto 
made  her move.  Picking up the bouquet of pink lilies, she made sure 
Ami was  facing the door then made her way over there.  

She saw Ami stiffen when she finally noticed someone was behind her.  
Makoto  held her steady before she could turn around and held the 
lilies in front of  Ami to take.  She smiled as Ami visibly relaxed, 
took the lilies and gently  placed them to her nose.  

&quot;I thought these would make a better impression than the pin,&quot; she said 
as  leaned just behind Ami&#39;s ear, still out of peripheral sight.  
Makoto would  have whispered but wanted to make sure Ami heard her over 
the loud music.  

Although it was brief it didn&#39;t escape Makoto&#39;s attention that Ami went  
ridged again.  In fact it made her smile, she knew that Ami already 
guessed  her identity.  

Removing her hands from Ami&#39;s shoulder she asked &quot;Do you like them?&quot; 
Ami slowly turned around without answering, Makoto couldn&#39;t tell if she 
was  happy or angry.  The look on her face was completely neutral.   

Ami didn&#39;t know what to say.  She couldn&#39;t even bring herself to be 
shocked.    

&#145;Makoto is Nat. Could this be true.&#39;  So many thoughts flashed thru her  
mind.  &#145;Maybe Mako&#39;s trying to be Nat for my sake,&#39; she was about to 
call  Makoto on this when she caught the look in Makoto&#39;s eyes.  They 
were filled  fear, hope and love.  The sadness she had seen there weeks 
before had gone  &#145;was she sad because of me?&#39;  Also the love was 
different.  She knew Mako  loved her, but what she saw in her old 
friends eyes wasn&#39;t the usual love  that came with friendship.  It was 
more.  

Then the logic of the situation flooded her mind, &#145;I never told Makoto 
the  woman&#39;s name, I only called her Nat.&#39;  Similar to how it happened 
to Makoto,  other facts straightened themselves out for Ami.   But one 
thing still  confused her: why did Makoto disappear in the first place. 

As Ami&#39;s body moved of its own accord into Makoto&#39;s arms the question 
went  to the back of her head to be dealt with later.  

Ami moaned with gladness and contentment as her mind fused her love 
with a  body.   She felt a delicate kiss on top of her head and slowly 
looked up at  Makoto.  She couldn&#39;t help but smile as she looked at 
eyes filled with love  and joy that must mirror her own.  Her eyes 
lowered to rest upon Makoto&#39;s  lips.  Ami didn&#39;t know who was moving 
forward as Makoto&#39;s mouth came closer.    

The sense of euphoria she felt at the next moment washed all thought 
away,  except one: I could do this forever.     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </pre>
