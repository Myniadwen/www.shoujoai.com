<p>“How pretty!” exclaimed Usagi as she excitedly jumped up and down.  She and her friends decided to spend the day together and go Christmas  shopping. Rei opposed, thinking that it would be best for Usagi to  rest, but since everyone else didn’t know about her condition they  thought it would be a nice way to enjoy the spirit of Christmas.</p>
<p>“Rei,  you need to go out and have more fun rather than stay in the temple all  day,” explained Makoto when they were on the phone. After much  convincing, Rei finally decided to go on with the plan. <em>Why does everyone always think I’m too serious? It’s only because I worry about the well being of my friends.</em></p>
<p>“Rei! Come on!” yelled Usagi as she motioned Rei to get in the photo booth with them.</p>
<p>“Don’t  worry. Usagi will be fine as long as we’re here with her,” reassured  Minako. Rei frowned, but softened a bit as the idol grabbed her hand  and dragged her into the photo booth.</p>
<p>“How about for old times sake?” asked Ami.</p>
<p>“Never again will I say those words,” said Rei as she remembered the time Minako made her dress up into that outfit.</p>
<p>“Please Rei!” begged Usagi with pleading eyes.</p>
<p>Rei sighed and gave in,“Fine.”</p>
<p>“Yay. Okay. 1, 2..”</p>
<p>“KUPII!” yelled all five girls as they took their pose for the camera.</p>
<p>After  the pictures had printed, they settled in a nearby bench to see which  one they wanted. Everyone was now gather around the prints, voices  talking over the other.</p>
<p>“Oh, this is cute! I want this one!”</p>
<p>“But I called it first!”</p>
<p>“Oh Rei. You should have smiled in this one!”</p>
<p>“Well, that was the one where we had to say…”</p>
<p>“Yes Rei-chan? Say what?” asked Minako with a sly grin.</p>
<p>Rei winced and said, “Ku…kupii”</p>
<p>Minako laughed as she elbowed Rei. “Oh it wasn’t that bad.”</p>
<p>“Not when it brings memories of the Nako Nako costume. <em>Aino Minako.</em>”</p>
<p>After  much debate, the girls finally got their share in the pictures. Usagi  scanned the area and a small twinkle had caught her eye. She turned and  saw a watch store. She couldn’t keep her eyes off it and ran towards  the window. The girls followed, wondering what had caught her  attention. Usagi looked at the watch on the display window. It was gold  with a silver face that had a crescent moon in the middle. <em>Oh this is perfect for Mamoru!</em> The watch shimmered underneath the glass, and Usagi could not take her  eyes off it. She finally walked into the store and asked the  salesperson, “How much is this watch?”</p>
<p>The man turned around and  saw what Usagi was pointing to. He adjusted his glasses and then took  the watch out of its display to read the tag. “This one is 8900 yen.”</p>
<p>Usagi  counted the bills in her wallet. It was enough to buy the watch, with  more to spare for other gifts. She was proud that she had saved enough  money for this shopping adventure. <em>I guess when you are stuck at home most of the day, you tend to save more money! </em>Usagi smiled at the man and said, “I’ll take it!”</p>
<p>In  the meantime, the other girls had already ventured off in the store  looking at whatever caught their eye. Afterwards they stepped out, the  weather started to get colder and they decided to order some hot  chocolate at a nearby café.</p>
<p>“So when is Mamoru coming back?” asked Ami.</p>
<p>Usagi  thought and began to count with her fingers, “In three days. I’m so  excited! However, he’s only going to be here for a week. His job only  allowed him that time for vacation.” She smiled and took a sip from her  cup. Usagi looked at her copy of the picture from the photo booth they  took earlier that day. As always, Rei had a half frown, half smile, Ami  still held a shy look, while Minako, Makoto and herself had wide smiles  on their faces.</p>
<p>Rei stirred her hot chocolate as her head leaned  on one hand that was propped up. While her friends were engaged in a  discussion, her mind wandered off a bit. Suddenly, she had an idea. She  stood up so quickly that it caught the girls by surprise.</p>
<p>“Rei-chan?” asked Ami.</p>
<p>&quot;Caught us by surprise for a second. I almost spilled my coffee,&quot; said Makoto.</p>
<p>Rei  looked at her friends while they stared at her. She smiled and shook  her head, “Gomen, just had an idea.” She slowly sat down, but this time  had a smile on her face. Rei looked at the buzzing street and found a  group of kids Christmas caroling across from them.</p>
<p>Minako glanced  up at the sky. She remembered not too long ago that it was this very  night she prayed for something incredible to happen to her, before her  illness started to take a hold of her and when Artemis came into her  life. She began to hum a little melody, and slowly sang a few words.  Usagi looked at her and asked, &quot;New song Minako-chan?&quot;</p>
<p>Minako snapped out of her daze and looked at Usagi, &quot;Perhaps.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Want  to give us the very first preview of it?&quot; asked Usagi as she leaned in  closer to the idol. Her eyes had a pleading look to it.</p>
<p>Minako laughed and shook her head, &quot;It's not done yet, Usagi.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aww.&quot; The odango haired girl sighed and then settled in her seat once more.</p>
<p>Rei  noticed Usagi's disappointment and comforted the girl. &quot;Usagi. Cheer  up. It's almost Christmas.&quot; She still had a smile on her face. Usagi  looked at her. <em>Rei-chan has been acting strange lately. </em>However, she dismissed the thought and smiled back at her friend,</p>
<p>&quot;Rei-chan!&quot; she exclaimed as she hugged the miko.</p>
<p>Once  it began to get late, Rei pulled Minako aside as everyone started to  walk their separate ways . The idol looked at her oddly, “What’s wrong  Rei?”</p>
<p>Rei had a sly smile on her face and Minako knew she had something planned.</p>
<p>“I wanted to make this the best Christmas for Usagi.”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“How about you and me plan out a surprise Christmas party for everyone at the room at Crown Karaoke?”</p>
<p>Minako smiled when she heard this and nodded.</p>
