<h1>Love Isn't Always the Same</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/probmina.html">Problehmatik-Minako</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;Usagi-chan, I don&#39;t have to love the way you love,&quot; Minako repeated to
her disagreeing friend. Her face raged with anger as she and Usagi
argued in a dark alley at night.
	
&quot;Have you forgotten about destiny?! I just don&#39;t understand how you and
Mako-chan could change so much in such a short amount of time,&quot;
responded Usagi in a gentle, confused tone. Of course, though Minako had
changed mentally and psychically, Usagi&#39;s day-to-day hairstyle hadn&#39;t
changed at all. Even Minako had tangled her hair into one long, gorgeous
braid.
	
She gazed into Minako&#39;s stunning, blue eyes realizing that the
conversation was upsetting her deeply. Minako, dressed a bit skimpy with
her low cut tank, short skirt and high-heeled sandels, crouched down and
leaned against the dirty stone wall. She found herself avoiding Usagi&#39;s
eyes by rearranging the sticks and stones on the ground. 
	
After a few awkward moments of silence, Usagi decided to make a move to
break the silence. Crouching beside her long time friend and senshi, she
removed the wool sweater from her body then adjusted it around Minako&#39;s
body for warmth. &quot;Here,&quot; she spoke quietly, &quot;it&#39;s kind of cold.&quot;
	
&quot;I don&#39;t need it! And I don&#39;t need your opinion about my relationship
with Mako-chan!&quot; Minako exploded viciously, throwing the sweater a meter
or two away from her.
	
&quot;Mina-chan! God! Just tell me why! I&#39;m more worried about the way you&#39;ve
been dressing and acting lately than who your latest partner is. I know
that I shouldn&#39;t stick my nose into your business, but I&#39;m just
worried...&quot; Usagi yelled back, concentrating on preventing tears from
dripping down her face.
	
For a minute, the old, serene look returned to Minako&#39;s face and bright
eyes, but it quickly disappeared as the anger possessed her once more.
	
&quot;Usagi, can&#39;t you just accept me for who I am? What? I&#39;m not beautiful
enough to show my body? I don&#39;t want to be the innocent, yet cute,
daddy&#39;s girl anymore. I want to be pretty, Usagi! I want guys to notice
me and say to themselves that I&#39;m beautiful. My heart has shattered too
many damn times. I don&#39;t even feel for men anymore. Personality is
important to me, and Mako-chan&#39;s is amazing and -&quot;

&quot;You are beautiful and guys have always thought that of you! As Venus-
sama, you represent the ultimate form of pulchritude and perfection. You
are the sole guardian of love and you will be now and forever,&quot; the
convincing words soared from Usagi&#39;s, the protector of justice herself,
mouth, though they had cut Minako off.
	
Minako grunted with great frustration then brought herself to her feet
and turned her back. Usagi did the same and stared at Minako&#39;s almost
bare back. Above the skin was an alluring black lace bra which was
overly visible. Grinning, Minako turned around and glanced at the &quot;pure-
hearted&quot; pretty soldier of justice.
		
&quot;If I&#39;m so beautiful, why don&#39;t you like what you see now? Unless you&#39;re
secretly tempted to tear my clothes off and ran your hands all over my
body...&quot;
	
Shocked, Usagi almost didn&#39;t want to respond to such an inappropriate
query. But after quickly thinking of a response, she finally stammered,
&quot;You know that I&#39;m with Mamo-chan and I&#39;ve always obsessed over boys,
not girls.&quot;
	
&quot;Oh, really?&quot; Minako laughed, seeming to be amused and happy. She then
peeled off her shirt, put it aside, then approached Usagi slowly. She
touched Usagi&#39;s bewildered face, gently pressing her breasts against her
upper body. &quot;You like that? Are you sure that you wouldn&#39;t want a female
body against yours rather than a male&#39;s?&quot; Whispering smoothly into
Usagi&#39;s ears, she forcd her to look down at her breasts.
	
&quot;M-Minako-chan, please stop...&quot; she pleaded even though she didn&#39;t want
her to. Minako could sense what Usagi was feeling and that she was
completely lured in. She took Usagi&#39;s soft hand in hers, then placed it
on her bra. 
	
&quot;Touch,&quot; she breathed. &quot;Touch it, Usagi-chan...&quot;
	
Unable to control the fiery temptation, Usagi let her new desire guide
the way. She grabbed Minako&#39;s breasts, squeezing them playfully. Her
hands wandered to the back of the bra where so she could remove the bra
from Minako&#39;s amazing body. Once she had carefully removed it, she
tossed it to the ground then stared at her naked twins. She hesitated to
touch them though she wanted to so badly. Afraid, she was afraid. Afraid
of what Minako might think.
		
&quot;Go ahead. I like it...mmm...&quot; Moaning loudly, Minako encouraged her to
continue.
	
Relieved, Usagi placed her hands upon her large bust then squeezed them
harder than before. She then bent down a little and put her mouth where
her hands had been seconds before. The two girls moaned as Usagi sucked
on Minako&#39;s tits; the temptation to explore grew even stronger.
	
Suddenly, Usagi pulled Minako closer and began pressing her separated
lips against Minako&#39;s. They continued to kiss lovingly, Minako grabbing
Usagi&#39;s ass while her breasts were being grasped tightly, greatly to her
pleasure.
	
They soon found themselves in only their panties while laying on the
rocky cement. Usagi lay above Minako as they caressed and kissed each
other lustfully. Minako heard her name being roared loudly with delight
but she had stopped touching Usagi&#39;s body and lips.
	
&quot;Usagi-chan...Please stop,&quot; she asked, tilting her head to escape
Usagi&#39;s mouth.
	
&quot;What is it?&quot; Usagi had listened to Minako and stopped kissing her
luscious lips, but continued to feel her.

Minako was unable to throw Usagi off her, for the feeling she got from
her was  just too amazing. After moments of Usagi licking her and
feeling the curves of her body over and over again, Minako finally
regained herself and pushed Usagi off her.
	
&quot;Usagi!&quot; She yelled, then jumped to her feet then started searching for
her bra and top. Once she found them, she slapped them back on her body
then looked back at Usagi who wanted more of her.
	
&quot;What are you doing? I thought you were enjoying it,&quot; Usagi stood up as
well, gazing into Minako&#39;s eyes.
	
Shaking her head, tears started to stream rapidly down Minako&#39;s pure
face. &quot;I love Mako-chan! Look what I&#39;ve done now! I just let you touch
me and kiss me, and I touched you and kissed you! Mako-chan...I&#39;m
sorry...Usagi, we weren&#39;t supposed to continue. I just wanted to let you
know that I have a nice body and I wanted you to agree with me about
being with girls. What&#39;s Mamo-chan going to think now that you&#39;ve
cheated on him with me!?&quot;
	
Usagi tumbled out of her temporary dream to be with Minako, then
realized that what was being said was more than true. She scrambled to
find her clothes to cover her body then looked up at Minako&#39;s weeping
face. &quot;We don&#39;t have to tell them...I don&#39;t know what got over me. But
do you understand now? I may regret it, but now you must understand that
you&#39;re so beautiful that even I fell in love with your body,&quot; Usagi
walked over to Minako and took her in her arms, embracing her tightly.
	
&quot;I don&#39;t care if you tell Mamoru, but you and I shall never mention this
to anyone else or each other. Understand? I have to go now. Mako-chan is
probably wondering where I am this late at night,&quot; she said, wiping the
tears away before turning around and running home. Usagi was abandoned
in the night until she too returned to her own home. &#39;Mina-chan...&#39;
	
				/The Next Morning/

A brown-headed girl, named Makoto, yawned tiredly then got out of bed.
She looked at the clock, realizing she had slept in until almost 11 PM.
&quot;Whoops!&quot; She said while scratching her head, feeling a bit stupid. She
was wearing her green and pink pyjamas, a small shirt and boxers, so she
grabbed her bathrobe and made her way to the front door to collect any
mail she may have received. She unlocked the door and pulled it open
towards her and was startled when she saw Minako asleep on the front
steps.
	
&quot;Minako!&quot; She screamed then knelt down beside her and tried to awaken
her.
	
&quot;Mmm..? Mako-chan?&quot; Minako mumbled, still half asleep.
	
Makoto picked her up and carried her into the house and lay her on the
bed. She pulled a cover over her, noticing her shirt was on backwards.
She shrugged, concluding in her mind that Minako put it on backwards
early in the morning.
	
Finally, Minako awoke and sat up straight in the cozy bed. She looked
around the room, then soon figured out that Makoto had found her. She
glanced at the door when she heard it creek open, watching Makoto march
in with a big cheery smile on her face as she handed Minako a glass of
water.
	
&quot;What the hell were you doing sleeping on my doorstep, Mina? You
could&#39;ve just rang the bell, you know...&quot; Makoto stated, finishing off
her sentence with a little giggle.
	
Minako blushed, arguing with herself whether she should tell her about
Usagi or not. She looked up at her partner&#39;s beautiful face with no
intention of wiping her sweet grin away. &quot;Umm, Usagi-chan doesn&#39;t
approve of you and I being together.&quot;
	
Makoto laughed then started to run her painted nails through Minako&#39;s
golden bangs. &quot;Screw Usagi. She always wants us to follow destiny or
whatever, but what we do now won&#39;t change anything. Anyway, she&#39;s
probably just jealous that she&#39;s not with somebody as amazing as you,
Mina-chan. I mean, Mamoru isn&#39;t all that.&quot;
	
Turning very red, Minako randomly hugged Makoto tightly, then kissed her
lips gently. Makoto happily kissed back making sure Minako wasn&#39;t
uncomfortable in any way.

&quot;I love you,&quot; Minako susurrated truthfully. There was no doubt in her
mind how she felt about Makoto.
	
&quot;Aishiteru,&quot; Makoto responded in japanese. Though she said it in a
different language, it had the same power and feeling to it. And it
made Minako more than happy.
	
With a sudden desire to taste Makoto, Minako slowly pushed her until
she lay completely on the bed comfortably. Their mouths were centimeters
away before Makoto finally locked them together. They dislocated each
other&#39;s shirts, still making out sweetly. Minako felt Makoto&#39;s hand slip
down her skirt and into her panties and then reexperienced a pleasurable
feeling emerge.
	
&quot;Mako!&quot; She moaned delightfully as Makoto&#39;s fingers carefully travelled
underneath her pants.
	
The sexual period went on for at least an hour, the couple enjoying
every moment of it. They were both laying in bed, completely naked,
kissing, sucking and touching everywhere. The room was silent except for
the constant moans from both Minako and Makoto.
	
&quot;So...amazing...&quot; Minako said out of breath, looking into Makoto&#39;s green
eyes.

&quot;Very,&quot; she replied, then kissed her again.
