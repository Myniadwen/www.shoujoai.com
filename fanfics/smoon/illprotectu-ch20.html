<h1>I'll Protect You (part 20 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/runestine.html">rune stine</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/illprotectu-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>Dead violet eyes stared blankly outside the big window-like transparent 
glass door, wandering absentmindedly at the nothingness of green fields 
and trees. The owner of these eyes shifted, she walked towards the glass 
door and tried to open it with her right hand but she couldn&#39;t move it. 
Her right hand has a cast on it

&quot;Oh, I forgot. I can&#39;t use my right arm&quot; So she used her left hand to 
push the glass door. Cold air blew and conquered her room instantly, 
lifting her long, loose raven hair to its rhythm. She continues her walk 
to the terrace behind the glass door, leaning at the edge of it to have 
a better view of the surroundings. A voice suddenly sounded behind her

&quot;Ms. Rei, aren&#39;t you feeling cold out there?&quot; The voice belonged to 
Minerva, the nurse who is taking care of Rei, the owner of those dead 
violet eyes

Minerva waited almost seven seconds for Rei&#39;s reply

&quot;This place is a lot colder than the air I&#39;m feeling right now&quot;

&quot;Please don&#39;t say that. I&#39;m sure Master Mark and the others have a good 
reason why you&#39;re here. I guess you&#39;re just lonely, how about we talk 
about something interesting? Like clothes, TV shows or music-&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not interested on such things. Please leave me alone&quot; Rei cut the 
nurse

&quot;But Ms. Rei I just wanted to-&quot;

&quot;Help me? Then get me out of this place. That&#39;s the only help I needed&quot; 
Rei interrupted again, without looking at the nurse

&quot;Well, it&#39;s not really that. I just thought you were lonely and wanted 
to talk to someone. And since we&#39;re almost the same age I thought you 
might be interested on some things that girls usually talk about&quot; 
Minerva reasoned

Rei thought of something to tell to the blonde nurse. Something that 
will make the nurse understand why she doesn&#39;t want to talk to her

&quot;I don&#39;t want to talk to you. I don&#39;t want to look at you. Because every 
time I tried to, you remind me of Minako Aino&quot; She coldly said

Minerva was speechless at first, but suddenly she smiled at herself

&quot;I&#39;m glad to know you don&#39;t want to talk to me because of that. I was 
really bothered that maybe you don&#39;t want to talk to me because you 
don&#39;t like me. I&#39;m at the sofa next to your door if you need me&quot; Then 
the young nurse silently walks away

Rei let out a deep sigh of relief. Now she&#39;s finally alone. Not that she 
planned to escape. She will never do such reckless decision. Sanctuary 
will go after Minako again if she did. All that she can do now is to 
think. Knowing that Minako&#39;s alive is enough for now. She needs to think 
of a better way to outsmart Sanctuary. But is there any other way?

Another voice sounded behind, which annoyed the raven haired girl

&quot;Hey cop girl!&quot; The voice belonged to Grey

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t escape. Please leave, I want to be al-&quot;

BONK!

&quot;Ooow!&quot; Rei held the top of her head where Grey had just hit her with 
his knuckles

&quot;I haven&#39;t even explained why I&#39;m here and you are telling me to leave 
already?&quot; Pouted Grey

&quot;Geez, you could have completely broken my neck! What do you need 
anyway?&quot; Rei asked irritably

&quot;There, listen! Much better! Mark asked me to escort you outside the 
garden for a general meeting. So you should better change something to 
wear other than that flowery pajama you are wearing right now&quot; Grey 
explained then he digs his hand inside a classy-looking paper bag, 
pulling out a dress and held it with his hands on each side and placed 
it on Rei&#39;s form

&quot;Hmmm...Edward&#39;s right, red really suits you. By the way, I&#39;ll be 
pushing your wheel chair so you better behave like a lady&quot; Grey goofily 
commented as he covers Rei&#39;s face with the dress he was holding seconds 
ago. Rei angrily pulled the dress off her face and darted Grey with a 
ready-to-kill stare

&quot;I-don&#39;t-need-a-wheel chair, how many times do I have to tell everyone 
that I don&#39;t need one?&quot;

&quot;Alright, I got it. Go on and change into that dress, make it fast&quot; The 
handsome brownish blonde-haired man turns his back and walks away from 
the agent

&quot;I believe I haven&#39;t agreed to attend the meeting yet&quot; Rei said

Grey stopped from his tracks but didn&#39;t look at Rei

&quot;I advise you to come. All the answers that you have been seeking for 
years will be answered. I promise you that&quot; Grey&#39;s voice became serious

&quot;I will never believe in Sanctuary&#39;s promise anymore&quot;

&quot;...if you&#39;re talking about what happened a week ago, that&#39;s what we 
never expected to happen. What I really meant is about your parents. 
Please, I&#39;ll be outside waiting for you&quot; Then he finally went outside 
Rei&#39;s room

The raven-haired girl was speechless as she looks at the new dress that 
Grey gave to her. She wanted to tear it apart, but controlled herself 
from doing it

&#39;What else do they know about me?&#39;

--

-At the hospital-

A beautiful blonde-haired girl wearing a blue-green hospital gown stared 
blankly outside the hospital window. Her sparkling blue eyes wander 
absentmindedly at the nothingness of roads and tall buildings below. The 
blonde girl shifted and opened the slide window. Cold air blew and 
conquered her room instantly, lifting her long, loose golden blonde hair 
to its rhythm. She closed her eyes and indulged the feeling of air 
touching her elegant soft skin

&#39;Is the air saying something to me?&#39;

Suddenly a voice sounded behind her

&quot;Aino-san, aren&#39;t you feeling cold there?&quot; The voice belonged to a 
nurse, who is taking care of Minako, the owner of those sparkling blue 
eyes

&quot;I want to feel the air. This is the only thing I can do other than 
trying to remember who I am and what happened to me&quot; She replied coldly

&quot;Oh, is that so? I&#39;m really sorry if to disturb you but I was informed 
that your friends from England are coming here to help you prepare 
everything up before your flight tomorrow morning&quot; Said the nurse. Then 
the pop star turns her head to regard the nurse

&quot;You mean the people who visited two days ago? They said they&#39;re my 
staff...and I used to be a performer. But I can&#39;t remember doing 
something such as performing...I probably lost my talent as well&quot; Minako 
frowned

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. Slowly you&#39;ll remember everything. You just have to be 
patient. Is there anything else I can help you with?&quot; The nurse asked as 
she smiles

&quot;No, nothing. Thank you&quot; Minako turned her head back at the window as 
the nurse dismisses herself. She holds her bandaged forehead and glides 
her fingers on the soft gauze

&#39;Yes. Slowly...Everything...I hope&#39;

Minako noticed someone waving at her from the opposite window of the 
second hospital building. She improved her eyesight and a form of a 
small girl with long black hair wearing the same hospital gown like 
hers. Standing beside the girl is a woman smiling at her, probably her 
mother. The small girl calls on Minako&#39;s name as she waves

&quot;Minako-chan! Minako-chan! How are you?&quot; The girl yelled

Minako was clueless. The girl knows who she is, yet the pop star herself 
doesn&#39;t. But Minako doesn&#39;t want to disappoint the little girl so she 
smiled and waved back

&quot;See, I told you you&#39;re famous&quot; The voice of Minako&#39;s mother sounded 
behind the pop star

&quot;That girl knows more about myself than I do. I don&#39;t know if I will be 
able to perform again like...like what you say I used to&quot; Minako said

Mrs. Aino approached and hugged her daughter from behind

&quot;You&#39;re a natural talented lady, honey. You will learn quickly even if 
you are going to start once again from scratch. That&#39;s the same with 
you&#39;re memory. You have to believe those people around who cares deeply 
for you&quot; Mrs. Aino said

Minako just nodded. She might not say it, but she&#39;s starting to feel the 
presence and love of her mother

&quot;Oh, by the way, Wendy went here minutes ago and gave me your cell 
phone. The police handed it to her three days ago. She wasn&#39;t able to 
see you today because she&#39;s helping her friends prepare your belongings&quot; 
Mrs. Aino added as she hands the cell phone to Minako

&quot;I-I don&#39;t know how to use it&quot; Minako hesitated as she opens her 
flip-top cell phone and saw numbers and different shaped buttons

&quot;Do you want me to replace it with a user-friendly one?&quot; Her mother 
asked

Minako thought for a second then weakly nodded

&quot;Yes--but I&#39;ll keep this one. I might need it once my memory is 
restored&quot; She said

&quot;Do you want something to eat? I&#39;ll buy some food outside for your 
father. He&#39;s sleeping at the waiting room outside&quot;

&quot;No, thanks&quot; Minako said as she places her cell phone on the table 
beside her bed

Mrs. Aino kissed her daughter&#39;s forehead

&quot;You&#39;ll be alright. We promise you that&quot; Said Mrs. Aino as she turns 
around and walks to the door

&quot;Mom&quot;

Mrs. Aino stopped from her tracks. This was the first time Minako called 
her appropriately ever since the pop star woke up. Minako even called 
her &#39;Mom&#39;, like what she always calls her mother. Mrs. Aino slowly turns 
her head

&quot;Mom...that&#39;s what I always call you, isn&#39;t it?...Or is it mother...or 
mama?&quot; Minako shrugged a bit, having to think that she must have said it 
wrong

Mrs. Aino smiled. Minako noticed that her mother&#39;s smile is similar to 
hers

&quot;You always call me &#39;Mom&#39;&quot;

Minako sighed in relief

&quot;I&#39;m glad. I&#39;m happy I remembered. Now I am a little confident that I 
can remember something about myself&quot; She shyly said

-Back at Europe-

Rei and Grey walked their way to the garden. Rei is now wearing the 
dress Grey gave to her minutes ago. The dress is colored bright red, 
short sleeves with a small, black embroidered rose on the upper left 
part of it. At the middle part is a silk black ribbon tied neatly on her 
waist. The dress is two inches below her knee, the soft garment moving 
together with her legs. On her feet is a pair of silver high heels, much 
to her own dismay because it was her first time wearing such shoes 
(though she usually sees Minako wear them). Her hair is single braided 
and she was wearing silver dangling ear rings. The right arm that 
formerly had cast is now wrapped with bandage up above her elbow. Rei&#39;s 
left fist is tightly closed, for each and every step she takes going 
near the men who had taken her away from Minako, the more hate growing 
inside her

After walking meters away from the place where they came from, they have 
arrived at the garden together with the other four members of Sanctuary. 
Grey continued to walk near his companions while Rei stopped few feet 
away from them

&quot;Welcome Hino-chan&quot; The brown haired Mark greeted her

&quot;You&#39;ve welcomed me already&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m not finished yet. Please look behind your back&quot; Mark replied as 
he waves his hand for Rei to go on and look behind her

Rei lazily turned her body around, as if anything she will see won&#39;t 
interest her a bit. But what&#39;s behind her couldn&#39;t stop her amazement

She never realized that she had walked to a small hill, or perhaps a 
huge garden. She didn&#39;t even notice they walked almost two kilometers 
from the place they came from. The place they came from? Rei just 
realized that she came from a really huge white mansion that is placed 
in the middle of the quiet fields and trees. She immediately hides her 
amazement and turns back to Mark and the others

&quot;Welcome to Sanctorium. All that you see here is ours, now it&#39;s yours as 
well. This is the sanctuary of Sanctuary&quot; Mark explained

&quot;...I&#39;m not here to be amazed, am I?&quot; Rei suddenly asked

&quot;Yes. This is our first general meeting with you, our new memb-&quot;

&quot;Why did you take me away from Minako?&quot; Rei cuts him off

&quot;...We didn&#39;t mean to do that, we just--&quot;

&quot;You promised I&#39;ll be with her&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry if we--&quot;

&quot;You said she won&#39;t be hurt&quot;

&quot;We are really sorry&quot; Edward said

&quot;I trusted you! Even if I didn&#39;t know you, I trusted you! Especially 
you!&quot; Rei pointed at Edward who looked away

&quot;Cop girl, we understand that you are deeply affected, but we had made 
the very best effort we can to save both of you&quot; Grey calmly explained

&quot;You are so laid back, playing with other people&#39;s emotions. You know I 
will suddenly be attached to Minako so you used her against me. You 
abused my weakness, you almost killed Minako, and you ruined my life!&quot; 
Rei spat as she catches her breath then she suddenly calms down, which 
surprised them

&quot;But then I&#39;m doing nothing about it. Because I suddenly changed my 
mind&quot; She added. Mark, sensing calmness, spoke

&quot;Hino-chan, we really-&quot;

&quot;What do you know about my parents?&quot; Rei cut him off

Mark, for the first time, was caught off guard

&quot;I told her about it, Mark. I think it&#39;s the best way to make her 
understand why we need her&quot; Grey explained

Mark looked at Grey then to the raven-haired girl and sighed

&quot;...We know the person behind your parents&#39; death. The one you have been 
seeking for seven years. This person, as far as we know, is an assassin 
of politicians. And the latest news about him is that he is living 
somewhere here in England. A politician was murdered and his corpse was 
found in a small museum in London, they said that the murderer left a 
small figurine beside it&quot; Mark explained

&quot;Who is this person?&quot; Rei asked

&quot;...We call him Stephen Shards. But that&#39;s not his name&quot; Henry spoke

&quot;...He&#39;s the one who killed our family as well&quot; Grey added

Rei couldn&#39;t believe what she is hearing. These guys are just like her

&quot;You are all sons of politicians?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s why we all have the best resources in the world&quot;

&quot;But I thought you are a group of famous assassins and terrorists?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s because we threatened a politician who once hired Stephen 
Shards. That&#39;s why he kinda over exaggerated introducing us to the 
media. He said that we are terrorists even if we are not, but then he 
already said it so we took credit of it. We became assassins because he 
says so&quot; A blue-haired young man answered. Rei looked at him blankly

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry. I haven&#39;t introduced my self. I&#39;m Leonard. I&#39;m as young 
as you are. Nice to meet you Rei&quot; Leonard stretch his arm to shake hands 
with Rei, but she just stood still

&quot;Okay, you&#39;re not in the mood...maybe later&quot; He withdraws his hand

&quot;My father isn&#39;t a politician that time&quot; Rei said

&quot;But he was about to be the voted as the new house speaker that time. 
That&#39;s why everyone in the congress was threatened&quot;

Rei didn&#39;t know whether to believe them or not. But it was true. Based 
on her own investigations, the murderer always leaves a weird-shaped 
figurine near the crime scene

&quot;So you formed this group because you want to seek revenge?&quot; Rei asked

&quot;...Yes. And so are you, am I correct? You became a cop because you 
wanted to investigate and avenge your parent&#39;s death. And I believe you 
are the only one who had went far on that investigation&quot; Mark said

Rei shook her head

&quot;I am still investigating that case up until now, but not because I 
wanted revenge. I was filled with hatred back then, I hated myself 
because I wasn&#39;t there with them, and I didn&#39;t die with them. But as 
time comes by, I learned that even if I avenge the death of my parents, 
it won&#39;t do any good for myself&quot; She said

The five men in front of her are still silent, which gave her goose 
bumps

&quot;...but if you really need my help, I will give it to you&quot; She added

&quot;We&#39;re glad&quot; Edward said

&quot;But in one condition&quot; Rei quickly added

&quot;What is it?&quot; Mark asked, although he knows Minako is involved

&quot;I want to be in contact with Minako while on the mission&quot;

There was a deafening silence of guilt

&quot;...Ms. Aino is going back to London tomorrow for rehabilitation&quot; 
Leonard suddenly spoke

&quot;W-what? Why?&quot; Rei panicked, why does Sanctuary know everything?

&quot;Because she couldn&#39;t remember anything. She--lost her memory on the 
accident&quot; Leonard whispered
