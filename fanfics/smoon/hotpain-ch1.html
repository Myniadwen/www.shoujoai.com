---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 &quot;Why? Why?!&quot; Hotaru cried while lying on her bed, her face buried 
in her pillow, weeping. She was still wearing her school uniform as 
she just came back from school. Michiru was sitting next to her on 
her bed, Haruka and Setsuna were standing in the doorway to 
Hotaru&#39;s room.
 &quot;Why don&#39;t you tell us what happened sweetie?&quot; Michiru said with a 
soft voice.
 &quot;I... I... I promised myself... I&#39;d never... never use them 
again...&quot; Hotaru tried to tell as her crying choked her words.
 &quot;What? You&#39;d never use what again?&quot; Michiru&#39;s voice was as soft as 
it could get.
 &quot;My hands!&quot;

***FLASHBACK***

 Hotaru was in school, quietly standing next to her usual chair - 
in the corner of the last row - looking out the window. It was 
lunch time and everybody was talking and laughing like always.
 Two boys were chasing each other between the chairs and the 
school-desks, cheerfully teasing each other. Then it happened... 
one of the boys tripped and while he was falling he hit his head on 
a desk. He fell on the floor and a dark-red color covered some of 
his brown hair and a few trickles of it fell on the floor.
 The boy - Ryu - was very popular with Hotaru&#39;s classmates, you 
could consider him quite handsome and he could make friends fast - 
something Hotaru envied him for. She wasn&#39;t really close to any of 
her classmates.
 A crowd quickly gathered around the boy who was lying motionless 
on the floor. Even Hotaru came up to the crowd with shock in her 
beautiful dark eyes.
 &lt;No! Please don&#39;t! I can&#39;t! I promised myself...&gt; Hotaru thought 
looking at the boy, then looking at her hands clutched to her 
chest.
 The boy who was chasing Ryu knelt beside him and didn&#39;t know what 
to do. &quot;Ryu! Wake up! Stand up!&quot; he was crying to him.
 The dark-red color was spreading on the boy&#39;s hair and on the 
floor. Hotaru had no choice. She couldn&#39;t let the boy die in front 
of her. She slowly made a step forward and knelt beside Ryu. 
Everybody was looking at her. &lt;Maybe... maybe they&#39;ll 
understand...&gt; Hotaru stretched out her right hand and touched the 
boy&#39;s head. She closed her eyes and a moment later her hand began 
to glow. The blood disappeared from Ryu&#39;s head and from the 
floor... Hotaru opened her eyes, she slowly stood up, staggered a 
bit from the exhaustion. Then she slowly walked away from the crowd 
around the boy.
 The classroom was perfectly silent as Hotaru was walking away, 
toward her previous spot at the window. The boy slowly opened his 
eyes, much to the amazement of the crowd that gathered around him. 
Hotaru&#39;s eyes were locked on a sakura tree, covered in white, but 
she didn&#39;t see it. Her body was frozen but she felt great tension 
inside. She was waiting...
 Then the first reactions and words rose from the group around Ryu:
 &quot;Did you see that?&quot;
 &quot;What happened?&quot;
 &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;
 &quot;... witch ... Tomoe is a witch!&quot;
 &lt; W I T C H &gt; The words cut through Hotaru&#39;s heart and mind like a 
chainsaw, shredding everything underneath it. But the tension was 
relieved and her head tilted to face the ground, her hair hiding 
her face. A single tear poured from her eye, ran across her face 
and fell to the ground...

***END OF FLASHBACK***

 &quot;It&#39;s okay honey, everything is gonna be okay.&quot; Michiru tried to 
calm Hotaru down. She didn&#39;t know what else to say.
 Suddenly the doorbell rang. Haruka had to go downstairs to answer 
it - Hotaru&#39;s room was on the second floor. She was thinking to 
herself who could that be as she opened the door. Much to her 
surprise, outside was standing Usagi. Her usual ear-to-ear smile 
faded as she saw Haruka&#39;s serious face.
 &quot;Oh, Usagi, it&#39;s you. Hi.&quot; Haruka said unenthusiastically.
 &quot;Haruka, you look so worried. What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Usagi asked 
concerned.
 &quot;Come here. Sit down.&quot; Haruka led Usagi into the living room. She 
explained the story to her and the room fell in silence.
 After about 15 minutes Michiru and Setsuna also came downstairs.
 &quot;Well?&quot; Haruka asked the two tall girls.
 &quot;I don&#39;t know what else to say to her. &quot;She said she wants to be 
alone.&quot; Michiru explained. Setsuna&#39;s face looked so sad it could 
make walls cry, Usagi thought to herself. Hotaru was to her like 
the child she could never have.
 &quot;Let me talk to her, please.&quot; Usagi stepped forward.
 &quot;I don&#39;t know, Usagi.&quot; Michiru said. &quot;She said she wants to be 
alone.&quot;
 After a moment Setsuna broke the silence: &quot;Let her try...&quot;. She 
knew Usagi was good in talking to people - she has watched her long 
before Usagi became Sailor Moon. She had watched her in the Silver 
Millennium, in the present and in Crystal Tokyo. If anybody could 
calm Hotaru down it would be Usagi.
 &quot;OK, what kind of ice cream do you have in the fridge?&quot;
 Michiru and Haruka looked puzzled at each other but Setsuna&#39;s face 
lit up a bit. &quot;Come with me, I&#39;ll show you.&quot; she said to Usagi.
 &quot;Well, there goes my diet for my Mamo-chan!&quot; Usagi laughed, 
sincerely trying to break the tension.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Hotaru was still lying on her bed as she heard a knock on her 
door. &quot;Hotaru-chan, can I come in?&quot; She knew this voice, of course, 
but she was too sad and too confused right now to place it on the 
right face. &quot;Who... Who is it?&quot; she managed to ask between her 
sobs. &quot;It&#39;s me, Usagi.&quot; As there was no answer to that Usagi came 
in.
 The room was unusually bright, not matching the mood in it. In the 
middle of the bright room there was a fragile little dark-haired 
girl crying on her bed; no wonder Setsuna was so heart-broken.
 Usagi sad down on Hotaru&#39;s bed and spoke to her: &quot;Come here, come 
into my arms.&quot; Usagi picked Hotaru up and took her softly in her 
embrace. Her eyes were red and swallowed and her cheeks were damp. 
Hotaru put her head on Usagi&#39;s shoulder and Usagi whispered quietly 
in her ear.
 &quot;You did the right thing, you had no choice.&quot;
 &quot;But why... why do they... hate me...&quot;
 &quot;They don&#39;t hate you. They just don&#39;t understand it.&quot;
 Usagi&#39;s embrace was warm and cozy; Hotaru felt so comfortable 
when Usagi was holding her. Soon her tears subsided and in about 
half an hour she spoke again.
 &quot;I wish I wouldn&#39;t have these powers...&quot; she said.
 &quot;Don&#39;t say that. These powers make you special. You&#39;re the only 
one in the whole world who has these powers.&quot;
 After a pause Hotaru said: &quot;Thank you, Usagi-chan.&quot;
 &quot;Now let&#39;s eat the ice cream! This will make you feel better.&quot; 
Usagi said, her eyes already shining with anticipation.
 &quot;Usagi-chan?&quot;
 &quot;Yes, Hotaru-chan?&quot;
 &quot;Can you hold me a little longer, please?&quot;
 &quot;Oh... Of course Hotaru-chan...&quot; but deep inside Usagi thought: 
&lt;Soon, my tummy... Soon it will be ours! OURS! Bwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!&gt;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The sun was already going down while Setsuna, Haruka and Michiru 
were sitting in the living room - Haruka and Michiru on the couch, 
holding hands, and Setsuna in a big armchair.
 They heard a door close in the upper floor and a voice groaning: 
&quot;Ow... ah... ow...&quot; Then Usagi appeared on top of the stairs.
 &quot;What happened?&quot; the three asked almost simultaneously.
 &quot;I... I&#39;ll be okay.&quot; She was still holding her spoon in her hand.
 &quot;What&#39;s with Hotaru?&quot; Haruka asked.
 &quot;She&#39;ll be okay too. By the way, have you got anything against 
tummy-ache?&quot; Usagi inquired with pain in her eyes.
 &quot;Here you go.&quot; Setsuna handed her a small package as the three 
girls were running past her towards Hotaru&#39;s room.
 As Usagi finally reached the couch the trio was already down 
again.
 &quot;Thank you so much Usagi!&quot; Setsuna began.
 &quot;How did you do it anyway?&quot; Michiru wanted to know.
 &quot;It&#39;s a secret. No, just kidding. I don&#39;t know really, I guess I&#39;m 
good at that kind of things.&quot;
 &quot;Is there anything we can do for you, Usagi?&quot; Haruka offered.
 &quot;Well, you could drive me home. I&#39;m running a bit late.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 &quot;Ow... Aw...&quot; Usagi was still groaning as Haruka was driving her 
home.
 &quot;How much of the ice cream did *you* actually eat and how much did 
Hotaru eat?&quot; Haruka wanted to know.
 &quot;Well, she&#39;s not a good eater, you should really do something 
about that. She only had a few spoons and I had to eat the rest. I 
had no choice.&quot; Usagi answered baldly.
 &quot;Well, you could *not* eat it.&quot;
 &quot;Oh, no! I couldn&#39;t do that!&quot; Usagi answered seriously.
 &lt;And this girl gets to be a queen, I don&#39;t understand this world.&gt; 
Haruka smiled to herself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Hotaru followed Usagi&#39;s advice and put on her favorite nightie 
while she was getting ready for bed. Usagi said it would make her 
feel better - and it actually did. It was a pink silken night-gown 
reaching only a few inches beneath her crotch. It was semi-
transparent and she loved to watch herself in it in front of the 
mirror. She also loved the touch of the silk against her bare skin 
- against her breasts, her belly, her back, her thighs.
 Hotaru was just standing in the middle of her room letting the 
sensation wash through her body, her eyes closed. She was 
wearing nothing but her pink nightie and her white cotton panties. 
It wasn&#39;t the ideal combination but it didn&#39;t matter to Hotaru, as 
long as she was comfortable.
 Then she suddenly opened her eyes and with a certain glow in her 
dark jewels she quickly pulled down her panties. The silk touched 
the cheeks of her butt and a certain warm feeling began building 
inside of her. She walked up and down her room so that the fabric 
could touch every square inch of her body. The silk followed the 
moves of her body - it touched her here and there, just briefly, 
and the warmth inside her grew. The silk touched her pubic hair and 
underneath, her pussy, which was getting wetter every second.
 Her nipples were pushing hard against the fabric when Hotaru 
suddenly decided to stop. It was a long and tiresome day and she 
was too exhausted to do it. She sat down on her bed to catch her 
breath and then she crawled in her bed.
 She was trying to sleep but she couldn&#39;t. Her thoughts started 
wandering off, like they often do when you can&#39;t fall asleep. 
&lt;Usagi-chan was so nice to me ... she really is a true princess ... 
... but, man, does she eat a lot ... she finished off the whole 
bucket of ice cream almost by herself ... ... I wonder what will 
happen tomorrow in school ... no! I don&#39;t want to think about that 
now ... I can hear Haruka-papa and Michiru-mama giggling downstairs 
... I wonder if they are watching slippery movies again ... I 
caught them once watching that kind of movies ... I walked in the 
living room &#39;cause I wanted to know what&#39;s so funny and they turned 
off the TV immediately and hid under the blankets ... I think they 
were naked ... ... oh no, I&#39;m getting wet again ... I wish you 
could turn this off sometimes ... sometimes, not often though ... 
oh! ChibiUsa-chan is coming tomorrow after school for a visit ... 
Usagi-chan promised me she&#39;d send her over ... ChibiUsa-chan was my 
first friend ... we really got close over time ... without her I 
wouldn&#39;t have so many friends now ... oh, ChibiUsa-chan ... ahhh 
... I&#39;m so hot ... now I have to do it ... oh, ChibiUsa-chan ...&gt;
 Hotaru began to move under her blanket just to experience the 
sensation of the silk moving over her body again. She brought her 
hand up to her breasts and began squeezing them lightly. Normally 
this wouldn&#39;t have as much effect as it had this time. The feeling 
of the silk pressed against her breasts and her nipples was almost 
magical. &quot;...oh, ChibiUsa-chan...&quot; Hotaru whispered silently 
against the empty room. Hotaru imagined ChibiUsa&#39;s fingers, not her 
own, were pinching and pulling at Hotaru&#39;s nipples and it made her 
even hotter. She breathed deeper and faster when one hand wandered 
past her belly-button and reached her dark curls above her pussy. 
She pulled her nightie up to uncover her wet pussy. While her left 
hand was playing with her hard nipple her right hand stopped in the 
jungle just above her pleasure center. She imagined what would it 
be like if ChibiUsa&#39;s hand would be there combing her curls with 
her hands. Next she ran her finger across the line her swollen 
pussylips formed. &quot;ChibiUsa...&quot; she moaned a bit louder. She 
brought her finger up to her mouth and licked it hastily, tasting 
her sweet juices. Her hand returned quickly to her wet pussy, not 
wasting any time to stop anywhere but directly above her pleasure 
center. She touched her swollen jewel as gently as the 
circumstances - her body was on fire - allowed her. As her left 
hand violently pulled at her nipple the right one was circling 
around her love button touching it from time to time sending 
shivers up and down her spine. Her breathing was shallow now and 
very fast. She pinched and pulled at her nipple and her clitoris 
coming closer to her climax every moment. Hotaru twitched her 
nipple one last time and pushed her finger inside of her for just 
half an inch as her muscles locked it inside. &quot;ChibiUsa!&quot; she 
screamed and then her body froze for a moment under the sheets of 
her bed.
 As he body relaxed she brought her finger to her mouth again and 
licked it clean. &lt;...oh, ChibiUsa...&gt; were her last thoughts before 
she fell asleep with her finger in her mouth.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Hotaru was slowly walking with a heavy heart the next morning. She 
entered the classroom looking down, knowing she is being watched by 
everybody. She put down her schoolbag on her desk and stepped to 
the window. She was looking at the white sakura tree, admiring the 
beauty of it when somebody stepped up beside her: &quot;Tomoe Hotaru...&quot;
She turned around and clutched her arms to her chest in defense 
instinctively. In front of her was standing the boy she healed 
yesterday.
 &quot;Tomoe Hotaru... errr... I want to thank you for saving my life 
yesterday.&quot; He bowed deeply to show her his respect. &quot;If there is 
anything I can do for you -&quot; The bell interrupted him in the middle 
of his speech.
 &quot;I&#39;ll talk to you later, OK?&quot; he said as the teacher entered the 
classroom. Hotaru just nodded silently and a little confused but 
her heart was screaming with joy.
