Up on the stage, in front of the usual curtain background used for the 
editorials, Setsuna stood smiling proudly out at the audience.

&quot;Hello everyone.&quot; Setsuna says, &quot;We had a lot of fun last time with 
Shingo running around dressed like Sappho&#39;s ghost. Well, being the Time 
Senshi, I decided to go back in time to the seventh century B.C. to 
bring out a very special guest. Ladies and gentlemen, let&#39;s all put our 
hands together for a great sport and the woman Plato called &#145;the Tenth 
Muse,&#39; the real Sappho.&quot;

To the sound of applause a stately young woman in her early thirties 
comes out to stand next to Setsuna, &quot;Thank you.&quot; she says, &quot;It&#39;s a 
pleasure being here.&quot;

From off stage Setsuna&#39;s roommates, Haruka and Michiru, come out to join 
Setsuna and Sappho. Both look uncharacteristically in awe of the female 
poetess.

&quot;S... Sappho-sempai,&quot; Michiru says as she clings onto a book of the 
Grecian&#39;s extant poems, &quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re really here! I... We... 
Ruka and I are big admirers of your work, and...&quot;

Sappho smiled kindly at the pair, &quot;Say no more dear.&quot; she took the book 
from Michiru&#39;s sweaty, trembling hands and opened the front cover, &quot;Do 
you have a quill pen and some ink handy?&quot;

&quot;Here,&quot; Haruka said as she quickly pulled out a ballpoint pen, &quot;You just 
push the button there and write. The ink&#39;s already in it.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Sappho asked, the classical Greek visibly impressed, 
&quot;Interesting. Now then,&quot; she said, flashing a smile at the two gushing 
Outers, &quot;Who would you like me to make this out to?&quot;

Before either could answer, Minako came out from the opposite side of 
the stage, &quot;Hey guys, what&#39;s up?&quot; Seeing the poetess with Setsuna, 
Michiru and Haruka, she looked confused, &quot;So what&#39;s going on? A toga 
party?&quot;

Michiru buried her face in her hands out of embarrassment as Haruka 
narrowed her eyes. Before the tomboy could get her hands on Minako 
though, Sappho came over to the young woman.

&quot;Setsuna?&quot; Sappho asked as she stared at the young blonde in front of 
her, &quot;Who is this? Who is this vision of loveliness, this beautiful 
little woodland nymph that you have kept hidden away?&quot;

Minako looked at the Greek in front of her, then over to Setsuna, 
&quot;Sets-chan,&quot; she said nervously, &quot;Who is this?&quot;

Setsuna stepped over to the nervous blonde and the leering poetess, 
&quot;Minako, this is the Greek poet Sappho. Sappho, this is Minako, or as we 
like to call her Mina-chan.&quot;

Minako held a hand out to the woman in front of her, &quot;Sappho, eh?&quot; she 
said, &quot;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you. I actually had to do a report on you 
for a course I was taking a year or so back, I...&quot; the blonde&#39;s voice 
drifted off as Sappho took her hand and, instead of shaking it, brought 
it up to her lips and kissed it.

&quot;Mina...&quot; she said in a low, sultry voice, &quot;Oh fair child, most 
beauteous of they whom today I have beheld, fair haired and blue eyed. 
Beautiful as the morning dawn and bright as Apollo upon his chariot. 
Would that you could look upon me, my young one, my lovely one, in the 
way I do look upon you now; smitten with a love at first sight she did 
but think impossible only a few short moments ago.&quot;

Turning away from Minako, she looked upwards, &quot;Oh Great Aphrodite, 
deathless daughter of Zeus, do but touch this young maidens heart as she 
has touched mine, that together we might praise you and give you thanks 
through our love for one another.&quot;

Looking back at the now clearly mesmerized young woman before her, she 
cupped her cheeks in her hand, &quot;Mina, my dear, beautiful Mina, this one 
who stands before you like a fawn before the hunter does ask, no, pleads 
with you not to break this tender heart, which does beat beneath my 
breast. I am like one captured, imprisoned in your eyes; do tell me you 
feel the same.&quot;

At that point, in front of the stunned Outers, she leaned forward and 
pressed her lips to Minako&#39;s. The blond closed her eyes as she found 
herself returning the kiss. After several minutes, the two separated. 
Sappho stroked Minako&#39;s cheek as she smiled at her.

&quot;Mina,&quot; the Greek purred, &quot;Wait for me behind the stage curtain, I&#39;ll be 
but a moment.

Minako, looking almost as stunned as her fellow Senshi, nodded slowly as 
she began to walk off stage in a daze, touching her lips with her right 
hand. Once she left the stage, the poetess turned back to the three 
stunned spectators.

&quot;What in the hell just happened?&quot; Setsuna asked.

&quot;You... You...&quot; Michiru stuttered.

&quot;You switched Minako!&quot; Haruka said, visibly impressed. The Greek smiled 
at them.

&quot;Heyyyy,&quot; she said, sticking both her thumbs up in the air, &quot;I&#39;m the 
Sappho, remember? Chicks dig the poems. Heyyyy.&quot;

---Omake Fifteen: Cuckold---

The Inners were all gathered at the apartment Usagi was renting after 
moving out of her parents house. They were saying goodbye to Mamoru, who 
was leaving to go to college overseas. As the time for him to leave 
finally drew near, he went to kiss Usagi goodbye, a bit surprised to 
find Usagi turning her head so that he kissed her cheek instead of her 
lips. He would&#39;ve asked her what was wrong, but it was time for him to 
leave.

&quot;Goodbye everyone.&quot; he said in the doorframe, &quot;Mina, Mako, Ami, Rei, and 
of course Usagi-chan. I&#39;ll keep in touch.&quot; he then turned and left.

All of Usagi&#39;s friends could see she was sad, and so they naturally 
assumed it was because of Mamoru leaving for college. Each tried to 
cheer her up, reminding her he&#39;d be back soon and that they&#39;d have 
centuries ahead to be together. Strangely though, Usagi just looked 
sadder than ever.

With a heavy heart, her friends noted the time and excused themselves 
for the evening, promising to come by in the morning to try to cheer her 
up. As they started to leave, Usagi spoke up.

&quot;Rei-chan.&quot; Usagi called, a certain desperation in her voice, &quot;Can you 
stay behind, please?&quot;

Rei looked at Usagi, and then quickly exchanged glances with her fellow 
Senshi before turning back to her princess, &quot;Sure.&quot; she said as the 
others left, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; she asked, noting how agitated the blonde 
was.

&quot;Rei,&quot; Usagi said as she nervously paced in front of the shrine maiden 
and fellow Senshi, &quot;We... need to talk.&quot;

Rei sighed, &quot;Look, if this is about how you slipped and spilled that 
soda on me at the Crown...&quot; she stopped when she saw the look her 
princess was giving her, &quot;Usagi-chan, what is it? What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

Usagi took a deep breath to try to get her emotions under control, 
&quot;Suppose... Hypothetically speaking, of course... Suppose you were told 
you would one day be a great person, famous even. In fact, you would one 
day be a queen of a large kingdom, but... But there was a price. You... 
You had to deny your heart, and you had to be with someone whom, no 
matter how much you tried, you couldn&#39;t love. And... And the one you did 
love, you could never be with. Would... Would it be worth it?&quot;

Rei looked at Usagi silently for a few seconds, then turned away from 
her to look out the apartment window.

&quot;I know what I&#39;m supposed to say.&quot; Rei said, &quot;I&#39;m supposed to remind you 
of your duty, of your destiny.&quot; She closed her eyes as she thought of 
her own unrequited love for Usagi herself. She knew it was impossible, 
of course. But the love she felt for the blond was a pure one, the kind 
where she would&#39;ve been happy if only to see her princess happy.

&quot;Fuck duty.&quot; she said, still looking out the window as a tear ran down 
her left cheek, &quot;If you don&#39;t love Mamoru, I say follow your heart. Tell 
whoever it is you really care about what you feel for them, and even if 
they don&#39;t share your feelings...&quot; her voice drifted off as she suddenly 
found a pair of arms wrapped around her from behind.

&quot;Rei,&quot; Usagi said in a tremulous voice, &quot;Please don&#39;t be scared off, and 
please don&#39;t hate me for feeling the way I do, but... I love you.&quot; she 
said, the last few words barely above a whisper, &quot;I love the way you 
smile, the funny way you tease me in order to get me to grow up, the way 
your eyes light up in the heat of battle. I&#39;ve tried to ignore these 
feelings, but... But I can&#39;t. I love you Hino Rei-chan.&quot;

Rei turned to Usagi, only to see that there were tears running down the 
blonde&#39;s eyes as well. Rei didn&#39;t say a word, she didn&#39;t have to. She 
instead pulled Usagi over, kissing her on the lips. The kiss was gentle 
at first, then quickly deepened as the two gave vent to their long 
denied feelings.

------

Mamoru was deeply troubled about the way the night had ended. Why did 
Usagi seem so sad and withdrawn lately? And why did she turn her head to 
avoid kissing him on the lips? Had he done something wrong?

He turned his car around and headed back to the apartment. He could 
always get another plane ticket. He had to know what was wrong.

------

Rei held Usagi tight, the blonde sitting in the dark-haired shrine 
maiden&#39;s lap as they explored each other&#39;s mouths with their tongues. 
Usagi softly moaned into her lover&#39;s mouth as the doorknob to the 
apartment slowly turned.

Suddenly, Rei&#39;s eyes shot open.

&quot;Mamoru!&quot; she gasped, &quot;He&#39;s coming!&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot; Usagi purred as she sucked on Rei&#39;s lower lip, &quot;That makes two 
of us.&quot;

&quot;USAGI!&quot; Mamoru screamed in shock, &quot;What in the hell do you think you&#39;re 
doing?&quot;

&quot;Mamo-chan, I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Usagi said as she got off Rei&#39;s lap to face her 
fianc&eacute;e, &quot;I tried to love you, really I did. But...&quot;

&quot;I... I can&#39;t believe this!&quot; Mamoru said angrily as he stormed off. 
Outside the apartment, a ladder was suddenly placed against the window.

&quot;That didn&#39;t go very well, did it?&quot; Usagi asked. Rei shook her head as 
the ladder moved a bit as someone climbed it.

&quot;No, it didn&#39;t.&quot; she affirmed as a hand now became visible on one of the 
ladder&#39;s rungs, &quot;But then again, this omake has been a bit more angsty 
than the others so far. Hopefully the comedy part will kick in soon so 
we don&#39;t loose too many viewers, I...&quot;

&quot;Fourth wall!&quot; Ami shouted as she finally reached the top of the ladder.

---Four Hours Later---

Mamoru, in his anger, had stumbled from one bar to the next trying to 
drown his troubles inside a whisky bottle. After the fifth bar he&#39;d been 
to kicked him out, saying he was too intoxicated, he wandered the 
streets until finding a new place he was unfamiliar with.

Stumbling in, he immediately attracted the attention of everyone in the 
elegant nightclub. The patrons on the dance floor and by the library 
watched as he made his way to the bar, walking past the dining section 
and again attracting stares.

&quot;Ggggimme shomething shtrong.&quot; He slurred out once he took a seat on a 
barstool. The bartender gave him a weird look.

Um, sir,&quot; the bartender said, &quot;We can&#39;t serve you here. We...&quot;

Lishen hhhere you... You bimbo!&quot; he shouted angrily at the blue-haired 
woman tending bar, &quot;I... I wanna drinky-poo, An&#39; I want oooone now!&quot;

As several of the patrons angrily started making their way over, a 
redhead came over to where Mamoru was sitting with her arms crossed. She 
looked at the drunk before her, gave the bartender a sympathetic look, 
and then turned back to address him.

&quot;Sir,&quot; she said curtly, &quot;Ryoko-chan here is not a bimbo. We cannot serve 
you here, so if you&#39;ll please leave, I...&quot;

&quot;Oh really!&quot; Mamoru slurred out, &quot;Aaaand just who the hhhell are you 
s&#39;posed to be?&quot;

&quot;My name is Arisugawa Juri, and this is my nightclub, Arisugawa&#39;s 
Locket.&quot; she answered as she tried to keep her temper under control, 
&quot;And the reason you can&#39;t drink here is that this is a bar for les...&quot;

&quot;Dirty dyke.&quot; Mamoru spat out.

Suddenly the music on the dance floor came to a stop as every woman in 
the popular lesbian nightclub glared at the drunk at the bar.

&quot;WHAT did you just say?&quot; Juri asked as her eye started twitching.

&quot;M... My fffianshee.&quot; Mamoru slurred, &quot;She l... Left mmme fer an... 
another woman. I wassss... wasss dating a friggin&#39; faggot! A dir... 
dirty fish-eating queerball! I...&quot;

A group of three women started stalking over as Mamoru continued on with 
his angry tirade, oblivious to the fact that the blue-haired space 
pirate tending bar was coming out to join them.

&quot;Hey,&quot; a woman with dark, scraggly-looking hair wearing a biker jacket 
said as she came over, &quot;I couldn&#39;t help but overhear your sob story. Why 
don&#39;t you come outside with me and a few of my friends, and you can tell 
us all about it.&quot;

Mamoru turned to her, noticing the bartender and two other women with 
her, and smiled.

&quot;Th... Thank you.&quot; Mamoru slurred out as one of the group, a gorgeous 
woman with tanned skin and white hair helped him to his feet, &quot;You don&#39;t 
know wwwwhat it&#39;s like, finding out yer girlfffriend&#39;s a homo, I...&quot; he 
was cut off as the women began to lead him out of the nightclub. The 
woman in the biker jacket turned to Juri, smiling as she cracked her 
knuckles.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Priss Asagiri said, &quot;Urd, Mara, Ryoko and I will take 
care of him off the Locket&#39;s grounds.&quot;

Before Jury could stop her, Priss ran over to the others who were 
exiting the building with Mamoru. Soon, the sounds of a fistfight could 
be heard from outside the nightclub, accompanied by a whiny male voice 
begging for mercy. Suddenly, everything got very quiet, then...

KA-BOOM!

&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!&quot;

ZAP!

The door to Arisugawa&#39;s Locket opened again as the four smiling women 
came back in, the smell of burnt flesh trailing in after them.

&quot;Priss,&quot; Jury said with her arms crossed, &quot;You and the others didn&#39;t 
leave a mess for me to clean up, did you?&quot;

&quot;Hell no.&quot; the Knight Saber answered, &quot;Most off what&#39;s left of him has 
already been blown away by the wind. The sanitation department will take 
care of the rest.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot; The redhead said as Ryoko went back behind the bar. As the 
blue-haired alien turned to her right, she saw two new customers coming 
up for drinks.

&quot;So,&quot; she said to the blond and her date wearing a toga, &quot;What can I get 
for you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; the one woman said looking at the list of drinks the 
Locket served, &quot;Most of these drinks didn&#39;t exist back in the seventh 
century B.C. What would you suggest?&quot; she asked, turning to the blonde.

&quot;Whatever you want is fine by me, Sappho-chan.&quot; Minako cooed as she 
leaned her head on the Greek&#39;s shoulder. Sappho turned back to Ryoko and 
smiled.

&quot;Heyyyy.&quot; she said, sticking her thumbs up in the air.
