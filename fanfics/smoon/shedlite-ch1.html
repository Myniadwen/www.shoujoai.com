<h1>Shedding Light on the Mystery</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/grandmoff.html">GrandMoff</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&#147;I&#146;m a little worried about Ami,&#148; Minako said as she fiddled with the 
bow on her uniform.

&#147;Nani?&#148; Rei asked.

&#147;Yeah, she seems fine to me,&#148; Makoto said.

&#147;It&#146;s just&#151;we&#146;re all here and she&#146;s gone again.&#148;

Usagi got some more arcade tokens.  &#147;Cram school.  Nothing new about 
that.&#148;

&#147;How about watching what you&#146;re doing?&#148; Rei challenged as a few of the 
coins fell on the floor.

&#147;Excuse me for answering a question,&#148; Usagi shot back.  &#147;I guess 
absolute grace is more important than friends now.&#148;  Minako and Makoto 
groaned, knowing that another argument had just begun.

Makoto rolled her eyes and ignored her squabbling partners.  &#147;Ami&#146;s 
always been the studious one, Minako-chan.  You know this.  I&#146;d be a 
lot more worried if she stopped.&#148;

&#147;But she&#146;s been stepping it up,&#148; Minako protested.  &#147;Haven&#146;t you 
noticed?  She&#146;s never with us these days, unless it&#146;s Sailor 
business.&#148;

The tall girl thought for a moment.  &#147;You could be right.  But it&#146;s 
possible that she&#146;s just working extra hard because medical school 
exams are getting closer.&#148;

&#147;They&#146;re still four months away!  And this class she&#146;s attending now 
is about literature; it&#146;s got nothing to do with medicine.

&#147;Besides, she&#146;s been acting differently when she&#146;s around us.  She 
hasn&#146;t been paying as much attention while we&#146;re talking.  When it&#146;s 
her turn to talk, she just gives simple, one-word answers.  She barely 
eats, even when you&#146;ve cooked.  She gets flushed really often and I&#146;ve 
noticed her breathing fast a lot, too.

&#147;But here&#146;s the fly that broke the camel&#146;s ointment: she was late to a 
meeting last week.  When has Ami ever been late?&#148;

&#147;There&#146;s a first time for everything,&#148; Makoto replied.

&#147;Well I&#146;m worried.  I think she might be ill or something,&#148; Minako 
sighed.  &#147;In fact, I think I&#146;m going to head over to her class and 
speak with her.  You can handle the brats when they start fighting, 
ne?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ve done it before,&#148; Makoto laughed.  &#147;I&#146;m sure I&#146;ll have to do it 
again.  Tell Ami that I miss her, okay?&#148;

&#147;Sure.&#148;

The blonde girl stepped out of the Crown and slowly started walking 
toward Ami&#146;s school.  Thoughts drifted through her mind.  She really 
hoped that Ami wasn&#146;t sick.  What if a youma attacked while she was 
out of commission?  The team could win without Sailor Jupiter, Sailor 
Mars, or even her, Sailor Venus.  But Mercury?  They needed Sailor 
Mercury.  Her bubbles bought them valuable time, her ice storm was 
very versatile and handy, and her illusion was just plain powerful.  
Apart from that, Ami was the planner.  She was the smartest, the most 
friendly, the prettiest&#151;

Minako stumbled but quickly recovered and kept walking.  That sure had 
been an odd thought.  Still, as Minako reviewed it in her head, it was 
true.  Ami&#146;s smile could charm anyone, her sparkling blue eyes were 
irresistible, and her shining blue hair was simply lovely.  The girl 
had great fashion sense, too.  She stuck to simple, solid colors and 
dressed modestly.  She always understated her beauty, the same way she 
understated her intelligence.

She&#146;s the best of us, Minako concluded.  Ami&#146;s the best senshi, and 
it&#146;s my duty to make sure that she&#146;s okay.  And if she is ill, I&#146;ll 
help her out, as I did when all the others got sick at once.  But this 
time, I&#146;ll be extra careful.

Minako reached the building and grabbed one of the door handles.  She 
paused briefly.  This was Ami&#146;s turf.  &#147;I&#146;m not nervous, am I?&#148;  She 
pulled open the door and stepped into the building.  She looked around 
the small lobby.  It was clean, with white tiled floors and beige 
walls.  An attendant stood behind a counter at the far end of the 
room.  Minako flopped into a seat and waited for her friend.

In a few minutes, students started to fill the halls.  Minako stood 
and scanned the crowd for&#133;

&#147;Ami-chan!  Konnichiwa.&#148;

The blue-haired girl saw her genki blonde friend waving to her from 
across the lobby.  She briskly walked toward her.  &#147;Konnichiwa,&#148; she 
said as she faced Minako.  &#147;How are you?  Is something wrong?&#148;

&#147;I was hoping you could tell me that,&#148; Minako answered.

Mizuno Ami rarely looked confused.  Minako giggled a little when she 
saw her friend&#146;s expression.

&#147;What do you mean?&#148; Ami asked, nonplussed.

&#147;Gomen.  What I mean is, how are you?  Nothing is wrong, is it?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m fine.  Why do you ask?&#148;

&#147;Because you&#146;ve been acting strange and I&#146;m worried about you,&#148; Minako 
said.  &#147;You look a bit red now, actually.  You haven&#146;t got a fever, 
have you?&#148;

&#147;No, I feel all right,&#148; Ami said, blushing harder.

&#147;Then why are you so distant lately?&#148;

&#147;Um&#133;am I?&#148;

&#147;Hai.  All you&#146;ve been doing is studying and working.&#148;  

&#147;I want to ace my entrance exams.  I didn&#146;t mean to be impolite.&#148;

&#147;You haven&#146;t been that.  But you&#146;re working too hard, Ami-chan.  You 
need a break.

&#147;So!&#148; Minako grasped Ami&#146;s arm.  &#147;We&#146;re going to get some cheesecake 
right now.  I won&#146;t take no for an answer.&#148;

&#147;But I&#146;ve&#151;&#147;

&#147;Forget it,&#148; Minako said, pulling Ami toward the door.  Ami allowed 
herself to be led to a small caf&eacute; that was near the school.

Once they were seated, the girls resumed their discussion.  &#147;You could 
do those tests in your sleep,&#148; Minako said bluntly.  &#147;What&#146;s the 
story?  You can tell me.&#148;

&#147;There is no story,&#148; Ami stated between bites.  &#147;I appreciate your 
concern, but I don&#146;t feel overworked.  I&#146;ve got great friends like 
you.  The NegaMoon hasn&#146;t attacked in a while.  All in all, things are 
going splendidly.&#148;

&#147;Do you want to come to my house tonight?&#148;  Minako felt her mouth 
going a tad dry as she asked the question.

&#147;I don&#146;t know if I should&#133;&#148;

&#147;&#133;Your mom won&#146;t let you?&#148;

&#147;Mother&#146;s not here.&#148;

Sympathy welled in Minako&#146;s heart.  &#147;Then you&#146;ve got to come with me!  
You&#146;ve spent too many nights alone in your house.  Come on, it&#146;ll be 
fun.  You need fun.&#148;

After a few minutes of wheedling and cajoling, Minako got Ami to 
agree.  The two young ladies set off toward Minako&#146;s house, talking 
happily.

&#147;You&#146;ve never met my family, but I know they&#146;ll love you.  I just hope 
you can stand them,&#148; Minako joked.

&#147;They&#146;ve got to be wonderful people if they&#146;re anything like you at 
all,&#148; Ami said.  &#147;I&#146;ve been looking forward to meeting them.&#148;

So she thinks I&#146;m wonderful, Minako thought proudly.  Coming from Ami, 
that meant a lot.  The blonde senshi glanced over at her friend.  She 
was smiling.

The girls chatted as they walked and they got to Minako&#146;s house before 
they knew it.  &#147;Well, here we are,&#148; Minako said.

&#147;It looks like a nice place,&#148; Ami remarked.  The house was tan, two 
stories tall, and had a yard with a flower garden and a few cherry 
trees.

&#147;Thanks,&#148; Minako said.  &#147;It&#146;s home.&#148;

The two young ladies took off their shoes and entered the house.  
&#147;Mom, Dad?  I brought a friend over, okay?&#148;

A tall, orange-haired woman and an even taller, light green-haired man 
popped into the living room.  Ami bowed politely.  &#147;Here they are: 
oto-san and oka-san,&#148; Minako introduced.

&#147;And you must be Mizuno Ami,&#148; Minako&#146;s father said, surprising Ami.  
&#147;We&#146;ve heard a lot about you&#151;&#147;

&#147;&#151;But Minako never told us how kawaii you are,&#148; Minako&#146;s mother put 
in.  &#147;Welcome to our house.  Would you do me the honor of sharing 
dinner with us?&#148;

Minako came to the rescue of her red-faced friend.  &#147;Of course she&#146;ll 
have supper; now don&#146;t embarrass her, okay?&#148;

Minako&#146;s mom chuckled.  &#147;Gomen.  Please, call me Miyuki.  May I call 
you Ami-chan?&#148;

&#147;Hai.&#148;

&#147;Thanks.  Minako, Ami-chan, let&#146;s sit down and talk for a few 
minutes.&#148;  Miyuki sat in her reclining chair and the two young ladies 
took the couch.

&#147;First, Ami-chan, I want you to feel welcome here.  Come visit 
whenever you want to do so, we&#146;ll be happy to have you.

&#147;Also, Ichiro wasn&#146;t kidding.  Minako&#146;s told us so much about you that 
I feel like I know you already.  She&#146;s said that you enjoy school and 
love studying.  I&#146;ve got to say that I&#146;m a bit surprised, since you&#146;re 
that different, that the two of you are friends&#151;&#147;

&#147;&#151;Mom!&#148; Minako interrupted.  &#147;I like&#133;school&#133;except for the tests&#133;and 
the homework&#133;&#148;

&#147;&#133;And the studying&#133;&#148; her mother continued.

&#147;That&#146;s not how it seems,&#148; Ami put in.  &#147;Minako-chan, you like 
studying, don&#146;t you?  You always seem to like it when we study as a 
group.&#148;

Minako had been blushing lightly, but it quickly grew heavier.  Why am 
I embarrassed, she thought.  &#147;Yes.  That&#146;s true.&#148;

Miyuki laughed.  &#147;That makes sense.  When you&#146;re with your friends, 
almost everything turns into fun.  But you sure hate studying by 
yourself.&#148;

The front door closed.  &#147;I&#146;m home,&#148; a voice called.  A young man with 
shoulder-length blond hair stepped into the room.  &#147;Did you&#133;&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s up, onii-chan?&#148; Minako said brightly.  &#147;This is my friend Ami.  
Ami, this is Tegani.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s nice to meet you,&#148; Ami said courteously.

&#147;It&#146;s nice to finally meet you in person,&#148; Minako&#146;s brother smoothly 
recovered.  &#147;Are you going to be eating with us, pretty young lady?&#148;

&#147;She is,&#148; Minako said sharply, &#147;and don&#146;t get any ideas about asking 
her out or something.  You can&#146;t judge a book by how skin deep it is.&#148;  
Ami and Miyuki sweatdropped.  &#147;There&#146;s a lot more to her than just 
good looks.  Besides, she&#146;s here because of me, so don&#146;t try butting 
in every two seconds.&#148;

&#147;Calm down,&#148; Tegani said, holding up his hands.  &#147;I won&#146;t hit on her, 
I promise.&#148;

&#147;Good,&#148; Minako said primly.  She clasped Ami&#146;s hand and stood.  &#147;Let&#146;s 
go to my room, Ami-chan.&#148;

&#147;Sure&#133;&#148;

The young ladies climbed the stairs and got to Minako&#146;s room.  &#147;Ne, 
Minako-chan, what was that all about?&#148;

&#147;Hmm?&#148; the blonde girl said carelessly.  &#147;Oh, I see.  Don&#146;t get me 
wrong, Tegani&#146;s a great brother&#151;the problem is that he can&#146;t resist a 
pretty girl.  You&#146;re here to get cheered up, no to be hassled.  I just 
thought I&#146;d stop him before he started.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s not quite what I was asking,&#148; Ami nervously explained.

&#147;It&#146;s not?  What did you mean?&#148;

&#147;You&#146;ve been saying&#133;no, never mind.&#148;

&#147;Oh, come on, tell me!&#148;

&#147;A couple of times now, you&#146;ve said that I&#146;m pretty.&#148;

Both girls blushed.  &#147;I did?  Yeah, I guess I did.  But it&#146;s true, 
Ami-chan.  You&#146;ve got that gentle, approachable beauty that makes 
everyone want to be your friend.  I&#146;m envious.&#148;

&#147;Nani?&#148;  Ami was incredulous.

&#147;People look at me and get nervous.  No one has the nerve to ask me 
out except for the total jerks, but most people don&#146;t want to be my 
friend either because they really want something more from me.&#148;

&#147;I never thought of it that way.&#148;

&#147;Hey!  Turn that frown upside down.  I&#146;m not someone to feel sorry 
for.  Anyway, yes.  You&#146;re kawaii and there&#146;s nothing else to be said.  
I&#146;m just glad I know you personally, so I can see how thoughtful and 
kind you are too.&#148;

&#147;Thank you,&#148; Ami said shyly.  &#147;You and the senshi are the best friends 
I&#146;ve ever had.  And&#133;you&#146;re right.  I was a little intimidated when I 
met you.  I&#146;m glad I know you so well.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t we sound like the first meeting of the Senshi Booster Club?&#148; 
Minako laughed.  &#147;What do you want to do?  I&#146;ve got a super-tough 
video chess game that I haven&#146;t been able to beat; I&#146;ve got tons of 
movies; we could paint; I could show you&#151;&#147;

&#147;&#151;What do you want to do, Minako-chan?&#148;

&#147;Oh, I don&#146;t know.&#148;

Her voice made Ami suspicious.  &#147;There is something.  I know there 
is.&#148;

&#147;Nani?&#148; Minako blinked.  &#147;Actually, you&#146;re right.  I had a favor to 
ask of you.  But I don&#146;t want to anymore.  It would be selfish of me&#151;I 
want to do whatever you want to do.&#148;

&#147;Please tell me.  Let me help you; helping makes me happy.&#148;

&#147;Okay.  We&#146;ve been assigned a life study drawing.  I would like you to 
be my model.&#148;

&#147;Is that all?  I thought it would be something difficult.  Of course I 
will do that for you.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re the best friend ever, Ami-chan!&#148; Minako said gratefully.  &#147;I 
promise, it won&#146;t take long.  How about you sit on the bed and get 
comfortable.  I&#146;ll set up my stuff.&#148;

The blonde girl popped a Nobuo Uematsu CD into her stereo.  She 
adjusted her lamps and the curtains on her windows to get the lighting 
she wanted.  She gathered her pencils and sketchbook and sat at her 
desk.  Ami was sitting with her legs crossed, hands on one knee, and a 
pleasant smile on her face.

&#147;Terrific,&#148; Minako pronounced.  She began to draw.

&#147;I&#146;ve never heard this before.  The music is very moving.&#148;

&#147;I like modern classical music&#133;hmm, that didn&#146;t make too much sense, 
did it?&#148;

Ami giggled.  &#147;I think I understood you.  I&#146;m fond of instrumental 
pieces myself.  I like songs with good lyrics, but when instruments 
are the only music, I feel more connected to the piece.  Pretty soon, 
I&#146;m feeling what the composer wanted the audience to feel.&#148;

&#147;Mm,&#148; Minako agreed.  &#147;When I lived in England, I heard all kinds of 
great music: European, Asian, American, African&#151;it&#146;s one of the things 
I miss about that country.

&#147;Okay, I&#146;m done with the basic sketch, so you can move more.&#148;

&#147;Let me see!&#148; Ami said energetically.  She hopped off Minako&#146;s bed.

&#147;It&#146;s nowhere near done.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re really good!&#148;

The senshi of love blushed.  &#147;Thank you, but I&#146;m really not.  I&#146;ve got 
a lot to learn.&#148;

&#147;Who doesn&#146;t?  This is a great drawing.  But&#133;it&#146;s kind of boring, I 
think.&#148;

&#147;Nande?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s my fault.  The pose is so ordinary that even your skill can&#146;t 
save it.  Let me give you a better pose, please.  I&#146;m sure you&#146;ll earn 
a better grade if your sensei doesn&#146;t fall asleep when she&#146;s viewing 
the picture.&#148;

&#147;What did you have in mind, Ami-chan?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll show you.&#148;  The ice senshi untied the bow at the front of her 
blouse and arranged the ends so they were trailing over her chest.  
Then she opened the top four buttons of her shirt and subtly spread it 
to form a V so that the garment just barely hid her bra.  She kept her 
legs together but pulled her right foot onto the bed with her, bending 
the knee at a sharp angle.  She put her elbows and forearms behind her 
on the bed and leaned on them.  She threw her head back.

&#147;That&#146;s what I mean,&#148; the blue-haired girl explained.

Minako gulped back a sudden lump in her throat.  Ami looked very 
desirable, sexy&#151;

The blonde girl wouldn&#146;t let herself think that way.  She began to 
sketch hurriedly.  &#147;I&#146;ve got to admit, this is a more interesting 
pose.&#148;  She tried to sound nonchalant, but she doubted that Ami had 
missed the tension in her voice.

The music played and Minako&#146;s pencil swept across the paper.  Was it 
easier to draw because she really enjoyed what she was seeing?  She&#146;d 
never imagined shy little Ami looking so provocative.

&#147;Okay, the preliminary sketch is done,&#148; Minako sang out.

Ami sprang from the bed and looked over Minako&#146;s shoulder.  &#147;Sugoi,&#148; 
she whispered.  &#147;Your first was good, datte&#133;this is outstanding.&#148;

&#147;If I didn&#146;t have such a beautiful model,&#148; Minako started to say as 
she turned to look at her friend, &#147;and if you hadn&#146;t suggested&#133;&#148;  The 
blonde girl lost her concentration as she inhaled the scent of Ami&#146;s 
coconut skin cr&egrave;me.  She was looking straight down her friend&#146;s shirt 
and saw two pert, shapely breasts barely held by a lacy pink and white 
bra.  She quickly looked up, into Ami&#146;s eyes.  Ami was blushing 
faintly; Minako&#146;s entire face was red.  &#147;&#133;I-if you hadn&#146;t&#133;um&#133;if you&#133;&#148;

&#147;There you go again, saying I&#146;m beautiful,&#148; Ami murmured.  &#147;And your 
drawing makes me look it.  Arigatou, Minako-chan.  I&#146;ll let you 
continue.&#148;  She sat back on the bed and buttoned her blouse.  She 
watched Minako curiously.

Minako took out her pastels and began applying color to her sketch.  
&#147;I&#146;m almost done,&#148; she said after a few minutes.

&#147;It&#146;s dinnertime, girls,&#148; Miyuki called from the base of the 
stairwell.

&#147;Hai!&#148; they responded.

&#147;I guess I&#146;ll have to finish after the meal,&#148; Minako said ruefully.

&#147;It&#146;s coming along wonderfully,&#148; Ami smiled.

Miyuki, Ichiro, and Tegani were already seated at the table when the 
two young ladies got to the dining room.  Ichiro had made shrimp with 
soba and rice.

&#147;This is delicious,&#148; Ami said enthusiastically.

&#147;Thank you very much,&#148; Ichiro answered politely.

&#147;So, Ami-chan, if&#146; I&#146;m not being too rude, how long have you and 
Minako known one another?&#148; Miyuki asked.

&#147;For just over two years,&#148; Ami replied.  &#147;I wish I&#146;d met her earlier 
so we could have been friends longer.&#148;

&#147;And how did you meet?&#148;

&#147;Well, I just, um&#133;&#148;

&#147;At a kind of get-together,&#148; Minako rescued.  &#147;She and I had some 
mutual friends, but we didn&#146;t know each other yet.  Ami helps us when 
we study as a group, so it&#146;s only natural that we would hit it off.&#148;

&#147;Yeah, that&#146;s natural,&#148; Tegani snickered, &#147;because you don&#146;t have much 
choice, what with your grades&#151;&#147;

&#147;&#151;I&#146;m going to beat you up, onii-chan!&#148; Minako sputtered.  She and 
Tegani jumped away from the table; he started running and she started 
chasing.

&#147;Don&#146;t worry, they do that constantly,&#148; Ichiro said.

&#147;They&#146;ll be back in a minute,&#148; Miyuki laughed.

All in all, the meal progressed smoothly.  Ami felt that it was over 
too soon.  She liked Minako&#146;s family members, particularly Miyuki.  
She and Minako were a lot alike.  They both laughed a lot; they were 
very energetic; they knew how to keep on people&#146;s good sides.

&#147;It should only take three more minutes at most,&#148; Minako told her 
friend when they got back up to her room.

&#147;Good,&#148; Ami said.  &#147;Then let&#146;s&#151;whoa!  Look at that!&#148;

The two young ladies dashed to Minako&#146;s south-facing window.  The sky 
was grey.  Light rain was sprinkling onto the city.  As they watched 
and listened, the shower became a deluge; the rain grew audible and 
went from quiet to a low rumble.

&#147;That&#146;s quite a storm, Ami-chan.&#148;

&#147;I love how they sound.  Peaceful, ne?&#148;

&#147;Hai.  They&#146;re really soothing.  I&#146;ve always enjoyed falling asleep to 
the sound of raindrops.

&#147;But you were about to suggest something.  Please continue.&#148;

&#147;Yes, I was saying that we should switch places.  I&#146;ll try to draw 
you.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s a great idea.  &#145;If you scratch my back, I&#146;ll walk a mile with 
yours,&#146; right?&#148;

Ami facefaulted.  &#147;U-um, anyway,&#148; she said after recovering, &#147;I&#146;m not 
very good.  You have to promise not to laugh.&#148;

&#147;I wouldn&#146;t do that.  Besides, I&#146;ll be you&#146;re a wonderful artist.&#148;

&#147;Promise me, Minako-chan.&#148;

Minako fixed Ami with a serious but kind look.  &#147;I promise.  But you 
know that I could never laugh at you, don&#146;t you?&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re right.  Could I borrow&#151;&#147;

&#147;&#151;Use whatever you need, by all means.  I&#146;ll try to give you a decent 
pose.&#148;  She clambered onto the bed and did a kind of half-turn, 
looking at Ami over her shoulder.  Then she sank down on the mattress 
so that she was mostly lying, except for the right side of her upper 
body, which she supported with her right forearm.  She brought her 
left leg forward a bit.  As a result, her skirt couldn&#146;t do a very 
good job of covering her legs.

There&#146;s no doubt in my mind that she&#146;s the senshi of love, Ami 
thought.  She&#146;s so stunning; I can see why she would have trouble 
romantically.  She&#146;d scare most people, I guess.  The girl with blue 
eyes and hair kept pondering while she sketched.  But she doesn&#146;t 
scare me, Ami reflected.  I know her.  There&#146;s nothing she wouldn&#146;t do 
for me.  And I&#146;d do anything for her.  I just wish she asked more 
often.  I&#146;d like to be her tutor&#133;just the two of us&#133;soft music&#151;what 
the blazes am I thinking?  Ami blushed and bent closer to her drawing.  
Minako noticed but kept quiet.

&#147;Okay, you can move,&#148; Ami said after several minutes.  &#147;I&#146;m done with 
my initial sketch.&#148;

&#147;All right!&#148;  Minako bounced off her bed and rushed to the desk.  She 
leaned closer.  Why does she have to smell so great, Minako wondered 
idly.  &#147;It makes me look like a cat,&#148; she said as she looked at the 
drawing.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry.&#148;

&#147;No, I love it.  You&#146;ve got such feeling in this.  It really flows.  
It&#146;s magnificent work, Ami-chan.&#148;

&#147;Arigatou, but your drawing is better.&#148;

&#147;No way.&#148;

&#147;Yes, it is.&#148;

&#147;Okay, mine is better,&#148; Minako said slyly, &#147;but what could you expect?  
I had a better model.&#148;

For an instant, Ami looked shocked.  Minako started laughing and then 
Ami did too.  &#147;I guess I shouldn&#146;t argue with you, huh?&#148; the 
blue-haired girl speculated.

&#147;Iie, because it&#146;s pretty pointless.  But all kidding aside, could I 
keep your drawing when you&#146;re done?&#148;

&#147;Of course, Minako-chan.&#148;

Minako sat back and watched Ami work.  She concentrates so easily, 
Minako realized.  She puts all she&#146;s got into whatever she&#146;s doing.

&#147;There, it&#146;s finished,&#148; Ami said.

The blonde senshi looked at her friend&#146;s work.  She was truly 
impressed.  &#147;Arigatou gozimasu,&#148; she finally whispered.

&#147;It&#146;s nothing, really,&#148; the ice senshi demurred.

&#147;It&#146;s something to me.

&#147;So, what should we do next?&#148;

&#147;Hmm,&#148; Ami thought aloud.  &#147;Given the time, it might be a good idea 
for me to leave.&#148;

&#147;Oh, yeah,&#148; Minako agreed slowly.  &#147;Let&#146;s find oto-san.&#148;

The girls looked around and couldn&#146;t find Minako&#146;s parents.  Just 
then, Tegani appeared and got his jacket from the closet.

&#147;Hey, onii-chan, what&#146;s going on?&#148;

&#147;Hi, you two.  Shiro just called and he&#146;s coming over to pick me up.  
There&#146;s a party at his place tonight.&#148;

&#147;But where are Mom and Dad?&#148;

Tegani rolled his eyes.  &#147;They told us this morning!  Don&#146;t your 
remember?  They&#146;re gone for the weekend.&#148;

&#147;Nani?  I can&#146;t&#151;&#147;

A car horn beeped loudly.

&#147;&#151;Sorry, got to run, little sister.  We&#146;ll talk tomorrow, ne?&#148;  The 
tall young man ran out the door and into the pounding rain.

&#147;I can&#146;t believe I forgot all about that!&#148; Minako yelled in 
frustration.

&#147;That&#146;s okay; I don&#146;t mind walking.&#148;

&#147;In that downpour?  You&#146;re going to be a doctor; you know you&#146;ll get 
pneumonia if you try it.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m Sailor Mercury, the senshi of ice.  There&#146;s no way a little rain 
is going to make me ill.&#148;

&#147;You don&#146;t remember when everyone but me was sick?  Besides, Ami-chan, 
you&#146;ll feel bedraggled and depressed if you walk all that way by 
yourself in the storm.&#148;

&#147;Minako-chan, what are you saying?&#148; Ami asked quietly.

The blonde girl felt her cheeks heating up.  She turned away a bit and 
kept her tone light.  &#147;Staying over here tonight would make the most 
sense.  And before you say no, I&#146;d like to make it clear that you 
wouldn&#146;t be imposing.  We&#146;ve got our guest room all made up and you 
can borrow one of my nightgowns.&#148;

&#147;Is that all right?&#148;

&#147;Hai!  It&#146;s honestly no trouble.&#148;

&#147;Well then&#133;&#148; Ami paced soundlessly to Minako&#146;s side and put her hand 
on her friend&#146;s shoulder.  Minako turned around.  &#147;&#133;arigatou 
gozimasu!&#148;

&#147;Wai!  Ami-chan and I have the house to ourselves!  C&#146;mon, I&#146;ll show 
you how to play poker; it&#146;s very popular in England.  Just let me get 
the cards&#133;&#148;

The girls played and talked and Ami couldn&#146;t remember the last time 
she&#146;d had so much fun.

&#147;But I&#146;ve seen how Rei&#146;s eyes flash when she does that,&#148; Minako was 
saying.  &#147;A lot of the time, she&#146;s really angry, but I think she&#146;s 
kidding a lot of the time too.&#148;

&#147;I agree,&#148; Ami replied.  &#147;She&#146;s just teasing Usagi most of the time.&#148;  
The blue-haired girl blinked tiredly.

Minako noticed.  &#147;You poor thing, you look exhausted.  I&#146;m sorry.  
We&#146;d better get to bed, ne?&#148;

&#147;Mm,&#148; Ami yawned.  &#147;But it&#146;s not your fault.  I&#146;m having a lot of 
fun.&#148;

Minako led Ami upstairs.  &#147;Here, you can pick one of these,&#148; she 
offered as she held out three nightgowns.  Ami chose a bright yellow 
silk garment that had orange flowers printed on it.  She went to the 
guest room to change.  Minako quickly put on her blue nightshirt.

&#147;By the way, where&#146;s Artemis?&#148; Ami called from the next room.

&#147;I&#146;m not sure,&#148; Minako answered.  &#147;He and Luna were checking up on the 
connection between ChibiUsa and the NegaMoon family, I think.&#148;

&#147;They never quit, do they?&#148;

&#147;Nope.&#148;

Ami knocked on Minako&#146;s door.  &#147;Are you decent?&#148;

&#147;Yes.  Come in.&#148;

The blue-haired girl opened the door.  &#147;M-Minako, I&#133;you&#146;re right.  I 
get lonely sometimes.&#148;

Minako impulsively rushed to Ami and hugged her tightly.  &#147;You don&#146;t 
have to be.  And you shouldn&#146;t be!  Ami, you&#146;re my best friend.  I 
hope you&#146;ll choose being with me over being alone.&#148;

&#147;I will.  Thanks so much.&#148;  Minako let Ami go.  Ami smiled warmly at 
her.  &#147;Good night, then.&#148;

&#147;Have pleasant dreams,&#148; Minako said.

&#147;You too,&#148; Ami said.

It was nearly midnight when Ami awoke.  As always, she thought 
ruefully, I can&#146;t sleep through the entire night if it&#146;s somewhere 
I&#146;ve never slept before.  She rubbed her eyes.  Well, why not get a 
glass of water and go back to bed?

Ami stepped into the hallway.

&#147;You&#146;re up, Ami-chan?&#148;

Minako was standing in front of the window at the end of the hall, 
silhouetted by the light of the half moon.

&#147;Yes.  But what are you doing out of bed at this hour?  Is anything 
wrong?&#148;

&#147;I just couldn&#146;t sleep for some reason.  I don&#146;t know why.&#148;

Some strange feeling enveloped Ami.  Was it sympathy?  Or was it 
something different?  &#147;Since we&#146;re both awake, let&#146;s talk, okay?  I 
think we&#146;ll both feel better.&#148;

Minako and Ami returned to the room and sat on Minako&#146;s bed.

&#147;I always wake up when I&#146;m sleeping somewhere new,&#148; Ami began.  &#147;I 
guess it&#146;s a habit.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ve been worried about you and now I&#146;ve made you worry about me.  
I&#146;m sorry.  Even now, in this house, you&#146;re alone again.  Except for 
me.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s a pretty big exception,&#148; Ami said softly.

Ami laid a gentle hand on Minako&#146;s cheek.  Minako turned her head.  
Ami&#146;s lips found hers.  Dark blue eyes stared into light blue eyes.  
Both girls&#146; cheeks turned pink.  Ami caressed Minako&#146;s face.  Minako&#146;s 
eyes closed.

What am I doing, Ami wondered.  But her body knew, even if her brain 
didn&#146;t.  Her fingers moved to the top button of Minako&#146;s nightshirt 
and started working.

What is she doing, Minako thought.  Wait a minute, I know.  I know 
what she&#146;s doing.  And&#133;we both&#133;need it&#133;

Ami pulled the nightshirt from Minako&#146;s body.  She carefully pushed 
the blonde girl onto her back.  Kneeling beside her, Ami ran her 
fingers over Minako&#146;s generous bosom.  She found the clasp on Minako&#146;s 
satin bra and unhooked it.  Minako sucked in her breath with an abrupt 
hiss.  Ami let her fingertips linger on Minako&#146;s exposed chest.  The 
chilly room and Ami&#146;s warm touch excited her and stiffened her 
nipples.

She wants me to keep going, Ami realized.  She bent and gingerly 
tasted Minako&#146;s nipples, left, then right.  Minako gasped.  Her hands 
flew to Minako&#146;s hair.  Ami&#146;s fragrance entranced her.  These 
sensations&#151;she&#146;d never felt anything so strong.

Ami&#146;s hands were now roving across her abdomen.  Before long, they 
found the waistband of her white panties.  Minako&#146;s heart raced.  She 
was scared for an instant, but she was far more hopeful.  She felt the 
fabric sliding over her hips and drawn from her legs.

She&#146;s ready for this, Ami thought as she noticed the glistening 
moisture on Minako&#146;s pelvis and inner thighs.  Intrigued, Ami lightly 
traced a path down Minako&#146;s abdomen to her labia.  The girl beneath 
her shuddered.  Ami sampled the wetness on her finger.  Not bad, 
pretty good in fact, Ami thought.  And there&#146;s no doubt that she&#146;ll 
like what I&#146;m about to do.  She kissed Minako&#146;s thighs, moving 
deliberately upward.

Minako didn&#146;t see the progress, but she felt it.  Is she really going 
to&#151;

Yes.

Minako&#146;s back arched and she uttered a soft moan.  Her legs trembled 
and she had to strain to keep them apart.  Her hands laced through 
Ami&#146;s hair frenetically.

Ami&#146;s tongue worked its way between Minako&#146;s slick vulvae.  She licked 
slowly and carefully, noting which places and movements got the best 
responses.  She used her fingers to spread Minako&#146;s lips and drove her 
tongue farther into the squirming girl.  Her free hand wandered up to 
Minako&#146;s chest.

Suddenly, Minako&#146;s hips bucked involuntarily.  &#147;Ami-chan,&#148; she faintly 
gasped through her cocoon of ecstasy.  The orgasm kept her from saying 
anything more.  It seemed to last forever.

&#147;Was it good?&#148; Ami asked timidly.  She sat up and covered Minako&#146;s 
nude body with a blanket.

&#147;Good?  Oh, Ami-chan!  You made me feel better than I ever have in my 
life!&#148;

&#147;I&#133;I&#151;&#147;

&#147;&#151;And now,&#148; Minako said, lurching up and grabbing Ami&#146;s nightgown, 
&#147;you&#146;ll find out what it feels like first hand.&#148;

&#147;Oh&#151;but Minako&#133;demo&#133;&#148;

Minako kissed her passionately.  Ami sighed, letting her tongue meet 
Minako&#146;s.  The blonde girl quickly removed Ami&#146;s nightgown and kissed 
her again.

&#147;Minako,&#148; Ami purred as her undergarments disappeared.

&#147;You&#146;re so beautiful,&#148; Minako whispered in awe.

&#147;Not like you,&#148; Ami said bashfully, crossing her arms over her chest.

&#147;Believe it, Ami,&#148; Minako reinforced.  She kissed Ami&#146;s earlobe 
lightly.  She gently pulled Ami&#146;s arms away from her breasts.  &#147;You 
have nothing to be ashamed of.  You are beautiful.&#148;

Minako kissed Ami&#146;s neck whiled she stroked the girl&#146;s firm breasts.  
Ami&#146;s breathing became ragged.  &#147;That feels so good, Mina,&#148; she 
groaned.

Minako grinned and let her hands drift down, to Ami&#146;s smooth, hairless 
labia.  Ami&#146;s breath caught in her throat.  Minako began rubbing her 
with fluid, teasing motions.  She tenderly licked around one of Ami&#146;s 
rigid nipples and then captured it, applying firm pressure as she 
suckled.  Her hands continued to stimulate Ami&#146;s pelvis but never 
touched her clitoris and never penetrated her.

&#147;M-more,&#148; Ami whimpered at last.

&#147;More what?&#148; the blonde girl mumbled against Ami&#146;s chest.

&#147;Ah!&#148;  Minako had found a particularly sensitive spot near Ami&#146;s 
vagina.  &#147;Don&#146;t be&#133;so mean!  More!&#148;

&#147;Can you handle it?&#148;  Minako slowed her movements slightly, smiling 
wickedly.  She knew how this must feel to sweet, innocent Ami.

&#147;Mina-sama!&#148; Ami begged.

Minako&#146;s grin got even wider.  In a flash, she threw Ami&#146;s right leg 
over her shoulder, straddled her, and locked her fingers with the 
desperate girl&#146;s.  Mina-sama, I like that, she thought triumphantly.  
She pressed her sex against Ami&#146;s and moved rhythmically, back and 
forth, up and down.  She and Ami were soon drenched in sweat and 
vaginal fluids.

&#147;Mina!  Mi-na!  Oh!  Mina!&#148; Ami chanted.  Her slim body shook 
uncontrollably.  She writhed as she came and it was all Minako could 
do just to hold her down on the bed.  Then Ami&#146;s motions set her off 
and Minako&#146;s second climax bathed her in bliss.  She toppled to the 
sheets.  The young ladies lay quivering beside each other, struggling 
to get enough air into their lungs.

&#147;Aishiteru, Ami-chan,&#148; Minako finally stammered.

&#147;I love you too.  That was&#151;Wow!&#148;

&#147;I think we ought to sleep in the guest room,&#148; Minako suggested 
quickly.  &#147;I&#146;ll deal with these sheets and blankets tomorrow.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll help you,&#148; Ami said, &#147;since I can&#146;t help but feel partially 
responsible for this&#133;&#148;

Both girls laughed, feeling giddy.  Ami put her arm beneath Minako&#146;s 
shoulder and they helped each other stand.  &#147;My legs sure feel 
wobbly,&#148; Minako giggled.

Ami dropped to her knees and ran her hands along Minako&#146;s legs.  &#147;They 
feel long and strong to me,&#148; she said playfully.

&#147;None of that,&#148; Minako chided.

Too late.  Ami kissed the back of Minako&#146;s left knee.  Excitement 
weakened her control of her body and she fell to the carpet.

&#147;Gomen.  Are you all right?&#148; Ami asked.

&#147;Yeah.  Now quit it.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll kiss it and make it better,&#148; Ami breathed.  She hovered over 
Minako for an instant and kissed her lips tenderly.  Minako returned 
the kiss with passion.  Ami&#146;s hands roamed her lover&#146;s body.  Minako 
felt herself growing warm with desire.

&#147;Now how do you feel?&#148; Ami asked, releasing Minako after a few minutes 
of massaging and kissing.

&#147;Much better.  Arigatou.&#148;

Ami hauled Minako to her feet.  &#147;Let&#146;s get some sleep, Gorgeous.&#148;

The two young women cuddled under the blankets and dropped off to 
sound sleep, feeling the contentment that love brings.

Minako had no idea what time it was when she awoke.  She felt a warm, 
smooth arm resting on her abdomen and heard deep, even breathing at 
her side.  Ami, she remembered.  I&#146;m so glad it wasn&#146;t a dream.  She 
smiled and opened her eyes.  The blue-haired girl had snuggled against 
her during the night.  Minako lovingly stroked Ami&#146;s short hair.

I really don&#146;t want to wake her, Minako thought.  True, I&#146;m hungry and 
she&#146;ll be hungry once she wakes.  And there&#146;s going to be a senshi 
meeting today.  Besides, I&#146;ve got no clue when Tegani will be back; it 
could be any second.  But I really don&#146;t want to wake her.

Minako decided to wait.  Soon she was dozing again.

Ami blinked at the light when she awakened.  Her arm was resting on 
something soft but firm.  She looked over and saw Minako next to her, 
asleep.  Then Ami remembered everything.  She carefully withdrew her 
arm, trying not to disturb Minako.

The blonde girl&#146;s eyes fluttered open.  &#147;Oh, you&#146;re awake, Ami-chan,&#148; 
she yawned.

&#147;Yes, but go back to sleep if you want to,&#148; Ami said hurriedly.  &#147;I 
didn&#146;t mean to wake you.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s all right; I was up already.&#148;

Ami leaned forward and kissed Minako&#146;s mouth.  &#147;Ohayo gozimasu, then,&#148; 
she said softly.

&#147;Did you sleep well?&#148; Minako asked.

&#147;In the arms of the goddess of love, I don&#146;t think I could sleep any 
other way.&#148;  Ami kissed Minako&#146;s shoulder.

Minako melted at the words and kisses.  &#147;I could really get used to 
this,&#148; she murmured.  &#147;Maybe you&#146;re really the senshi of love, not 
me.&#148;

&#147;You are love,&#148; Ami said, using her little finger to trace small 
patterns on Minako&#146;s bare chest.  &#147;I&#146;m certain.&#148;

&#147;Ami&#133;

&#147;Oh no!  What time is it?&#148;

Both girls jumped from the bed.  &#147;We&#146;ve got less than an hour until 
the Sailor meeting!&#148; Ami exclaimed.

&#147;And we&#146;d better get to your house first so you can change your 
clothes,&#148; Minako added, panicking just a bit.

&#147;Then we have no choice,&#148; the blue-haired girl groaned in resignation.  
&#147;I&#146;m afraid that we&#146;ll have to shower together.&#148;

Minako facefaulted.

&#147;I think we&#146;re going to make it on time,&#148; Minako said cheerfully as 
she and Ami neared Rei&#146;s temple.  &#147;In fact, we should have a few 
minutes to spare.&#148;

&#147;But I&#146;m kind of nervous.&#148;

&#147;Dojte?&#148;

&#147;Should we,&#148; Ami paused, blushing, &#147;tell the others?&#148;

Minako stopped abruptly.  &#147;I hadn&#146;t thought of that,&#148; she admitted, 
pushing her fingers together in embarrassment.  &#147;I&#146;m the senshi of 
love and you&#146;re the smartest of all of us.  We only just figured this 
out for ourselves.  So we&#146;ve got some time, don&#146;t we?&#148;

&#147;I doubt it.&#148;

&#147;Why?&#148;

&#147;Because Usagi is really good at reading people.  As for Rei, her fire 
shows her what she wants to see.  You said you&#146;ve asked her about me.&#148;

&#147;And Makoto&#151;&#147; Minako said before she could stop herself.

&#147;Makoto?&#148;

&#147;Um&#133;she&#133;&#148;

&#147;&#133;Come on, Mina-chan.  Please?&#148;

&#147;I think she&#146;s got something of a crush on you.&#148;

Ami swallowed hard.  &#147;Well&#133;are you sure?&#148;

&#147;Yes.  I was so busy searching through her feelings for you that I 
missed my own, and yours.  I guess people are right about me being an 
airhead.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t say that!  Your heart was in the right place.  They say that 
someone who&#146;s in love is always the last to know.&#148;

&#147;But what should we do?&#148;

&#147;We ought to talk to them one at a time.  But I&#146;m really not looking 
forward to facing Makoto now.  I don&#146;t want to hurt her.  Will she 
understand?&#148;

&#147;We&#146;ll make it.  Together.&#148;

Ami clasped Minako&#146;s hand.  She and her lover drew closer to each 
other.  Their lips met in sensuous contact.  Minako held Ami close to 
her in a strong embrace.  Finally, they broke the kiss and gazed into 
each other&#146;s eyes.

&#147;Now it makes sense,&#148; a smug voice said.  Ami and Minako whirled, 
looking startled.  Rei stood next to a tree at the top of the temple 
steps.

&#147;Rei-chan!&#148; Minako said.  &#147;I can explain.&#148;

&#147;But you don&#146;t need to,&#148; the fire priestess replied.  &#147;I asked the 
fire&#151;since you wanted answers, Minako-chan&#151;what was on Ami&#146;s mind.  
Then your face appeared.  My initial suspicion was that you might be a 
traitor.  I&#146;m really sorry for that; I thought it for only an instant.

&#147;But since I knew that wasn&#146;t it, I tried to think of what it was.  I 
couldn&#146;t guess.  So I had to see you two.&#148;

&#147;And you spied on us?&#148; Minako huffed.

&#147;No!  I was just waiting for you.  You were so focused on each other 
that you didn&#146;t notice me.&#148;  Rei&#146;s voice grew dreamy.  &#147;And it was 
very romantic.&#148;

&#147;Well, let me explain anyway,&#148; Ami said forcefully.  &#147;I love Minako!&#148;

&#147;And I love Ami,&#148; Minako said, putting her arm around Ami&#146;s waist.

&#147;Kawaii!&#148; Rei squeaked.  Ami and Minako grew even redder.  &#147;Have you 
told Usagi or Makoto?&#148;

&#147;Not yet,&#148; Ami said with a sweatdrop.  &#147;I think we should handle the 
meeting first, ne?&#148;

&#147;Hai!&#148; Rei agreed.

------------------------------------------------------------

Some of you who read &#147;Tints of Red, Shades of Pink&#148; were interested in 
how Minako and Ami hooked up, so I decided to post this prequel.  I 
hope you enjoyed it.  It got a little steamier than I thought it 
would, but hey&#151;it&#146;s Ami and Minako!  I think things would get hot 
really fast between those two.  Ja ne!
