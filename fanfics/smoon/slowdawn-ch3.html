<h1>Slowly Dawning (part 3 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/slowdawn-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Minako walked along listening to Yuki and Furiko arguing. They were 
beginning to sound like Usagi and Rei and it was getting on her 
nerves. She needed to get a fresh perspective on whatever it was that 
was bothering her. It wasn&#146;t that she didn&#146;t get date offers, it was 
just, well, the boys were so dull. It wasn&#146;t like she could tell these 
guys who she really was, what she really did when she ran out of a 
movie, or a picnic. Her excuses were becoming lamer, too. And she was 
beginning to brood over it - never a good sign. She didn&#146;t know why 
Furiko&#146;s question had so irritated her, but it certainly had.

She sighed and looked up. She was walking along the street that Ami&#146;s 
apartment building was on. Ami may not be not the best one in the 
world to discuss love with, but at least she could tell Ami what was 
on her mind. No need to prevaricate with another Senshi. I wonder how 
Ami-chan deals with it the stress, she thought. I mean, even Ami must 
have felt it...

Making a feeble excuse about homework, Minako left the two younger 
girls and entered Ami&#146;s building.

Ami came to the door to greet Minako, looking pleased, if puzzled.

&quot;Minako-chan! What can I do for you? Won&#146;t you make yourself 
comfortable?&quot; Ami led the way to her small bedroom and held the door 
open for Minako.

&quot;Oh,&quot; sighed Minako wearily, &quot;I just wanted to talk to someone without 
having to lie.&quot;

Ami looked at her quizzically, but nodded. &quot;I know what you mean. Let 
me make some tea - I&#146;ll be right back.&quot;

Minako sat at the low table in Ami&#146;s room and supported her face in 
her hands. A low beep came from the computer on the desk. Minako 
looked up at it, as a message flashed onto the screen.

&quot;Hey Merc! Have I got something for you!&quot; it said, with a smiley face.

Minako laid her head down on her arms and sighed.

Ami returned with tea. She placed pot and cups on the table, then 
minimized the message on the computer, before sitting down with 
Minako. 

&quot;So...&quot; Ami prompted.

&quot;So, I&#146;ve been thinking. Do you know the reputation I have in school 
right now? I&#146;m &quot;Minako the tease.&quot; Do you know why? Because every boy 
I go out with, I end up having to make some stupid excuse and leave 
early or break dates or...&quot; Minako broke off, exasperated.

Ami nodded. &quot;Well, obviously, I don&#146;t date as much as you and 
Rei-chan, but I know what you mean. The last time I wanted to meet one 
of my online friends for lunch I...Minako-chan? What are you looking 
at?&quot;

Minako sat, staring over Ami&#146;s shoulder, her mouth wide open in 
disbelief. Ami whirled around, her hand over her mouth, only to see 
the final pixels come into focus, of a full color picture of Sailor 
Venus, only partially clothed, head thrown back with pleasure, 
fingering herself in a lascivious manner. Ami leapt for the computer, 
but Minako was faster and grabbed the mouse away from her.

&quot;No you don&#146;t!&quot; Minako yelled, as she held Ami away from the mouse. A 
second picture came up on the screen, this time Sailor Mars and Sailor 
Mercury, both topless. Minako felt her eyebrow twitching as she turned 
to stare at Ami, whose face was now as red as Mars&#146; fuku.

&quot;You ecchi!&quot; Minako shouted.

&quot;It&#39;s not what it looks like, Minako-chan...&quot; Ami began a bit 
desperately. 

&quot;Then what exactly *is* it?&quot; Minako said, feeling a giggle well up 
within her..

&quot;When I logged onto this network, I used the name Mercury,&quot; Ami lunged 
for the mouse, but Minako held her off. Ami blew hair out of her eyes. 
She tried to stop the next picture, but Minako batted her hands away 
from the keyboard. This one, Minako found, was an animated picture of 
herself and Usagi, well, Sailor Moon... oh my god! She turned to an 
increasingly embarrassed Ami. 

Ami spoke quickly. &quot;So, someone thought I was, well, a fan of Sailor 
Mercury and he sent me some pictures...I thought it was funny, so I 
kept them. Now he, um, Fanboy1, sends me pictures he finds of us...&quot; 
her voice petered out, and she dropped her eyes, mortified.

Minako could not hold it in one moment longer. She burst out laughing. 
She laughed hysterically as a picture of Makoto and Ami, dressed in 
pajamas, and snuggling, appeared on the screen. She laughed as another 
picture of herself, in what appeared to be a physically impossible 
position came onto the screen. Finally, weak with laughter, Minako 
lowered herself into the chair in front of the desk. When she lifted 
her eyes once more, she was confronted by a deeply disturbing picture 
of Chibi Moon. Minako shook her head and turned to look at Ami.

&quot;I cannot believe this. Ami-chan! Who knew you were a closet otaku? A 
hentai otaku, no less! And here I was, wondering how you dealt with 
the stress of keeping our secret secret! &quot; Minako held her stomach, 
which hurt from laughing. &quot;So, you&#146;ve been keeping this stuff?&quot; she 
waved her hand at the pictures, which now included a very well done 
drawing of several of them in bathing suits. Minako giggled at the 
image. &quot;I knew you had a sex drive somewhere under that cool 
exterior.&quot;

Ami&#146;s face couldn&#146;t possibly have turned redder. &quot;Um, yes. Please,&quot; 
she lifted her eyes to Minako&#146;s, &quot;please don&#146;t tell anyone, please?&quot; 
There was a look of fierceness in that gaze, but Minako just grinned.

&quot;Only if you let me see them.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Ami was stunned.

&quot;I want to see them all.&quot; Minako kept grinning and slowly, Ami 
answered it with a smile of her own.

&quot;Are you sure? Some of them are pretty rude.&quot; Ami pulled up another 
chair next to Minako&#146;s and took the proffered mouse.

&quot;Start with those.&quot; Minako giggled again, naughtily.

&quot;Ecchi.&quot; Ami clicked a few times and opened a file called, not 
inappropriately, &quot;Venus.&quot;

If anyone had passed that room in the next few hours, they would have 
heard a variety of snorts and laughter, punctuated by squeals of 
outrage and shock and of course, the odd &quot;ecchi!&quot; thrown in for good 
measure.

When Minako left Ami&#146;s she felt as if a weight had been lifted from 
her, even the night air felt good against her face. With friends like 
these, who needed dumb old boys anyway? She laughed into the night 
breeze and jogged towards home.

As she lay in her bed that night, Minako recalled the pictures she had 
seen of herself and the other Senshi. There was something in them, she 
thought. Something their fans had seen that they themselves never had. 
Maybe love wasn&#146;t so far away after all. Her last thought before she 
slept was of dark hair and dark eyes and postures that were more than 
a little suggestive.
