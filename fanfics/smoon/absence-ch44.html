<h1>Absence (part 44 of 60)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kirika.html">Kirika</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/absence-ch43.html">Back to Part 43</a><pre>Rei walked leisurely down the halls of Minato General Hospital dressed 
in her school uniform, swinging her book bag as she went, seeming 
entirely at ease to the casual observer. However, if one looked closely 
enough, you could make out a minute tightening around the girl&#39;s eyes, 
and a slightly grim and uncertain expression threatening to pull her 
mouth down into a grimace. Usagi had opted to spend yesterday entirely 
by Rei&#39;s side out on the town, for one reason to make up for letting the 
raven-haired girl down the previous day, and the other to get away from 
her father&#39;s knowing and somewhat disapproving glances-- the blonde and 
her lover hadn&#39;t been successful in keeping their most recent intimate 
engagement very quiet, and it had been obvious Kenji, and not to mention 
everyone else, had heard the heated sounds of passion. Both Rei and 
Usagi had been eager to escape the embarrassing looks from the Tsukino 
family as soon as possible, and had stayed out all day until late 
evening. While Sunday had been an absolutely marvellous and blissful 
time for Rei, occupied with loving gestures and pleasurable moments, it 
had been partially spoiled by a nagging voice in the back of the miko&#39;s 
mind; a voice that bore more than a passing resemblance to a certain 
former neighbour of hers.

Rei frowned in irritation and redoubled her efforts to shut out the 
voice echoing in her thoughts. Today was going to be good day, and she 
shouldn&#39;t let one annoying man&#39;s sanctimonious observations bring down 
her mood. Usagi had promised Rei that after school she was definitely 
going to inform Mamoru about their relationship. And the miko trusted 
her true love implicitly. Rei nodded confidently to herself; it was all 
working out superbly. The prince was the final hurdle for her and her 
princess to cross; once Mamoru was dealt with, the future was their own 
to create in whatever heavenly image they chose. The Fire Senshi smiled 
at the thought; her dream was so close to her now, touching her 
fingertips, so near she could almost grasp it.

But, a little extra insurance wouldn&#39;t be amiss. Which was why Rei was 
at Minato Hospital to begin with, other than to guard the defenceless 
Sailor Senshi. She wished to see if she could squeeze any more 
information related to the upcoming masked enemy out of Setsuna. Rei 
wanted the youma&#39;s mask for her own purposes, and without a doubt the 
Senshi of Fire would pry it off the creature&#39;s cold dead face and claim 
the artefact as her own. The raven-haired girl pursed her lips as she 
realised a hiccup in her plan. She wondered if the Guardian of Time 
would let Rei use the mask to view the future timeline, or if that was 
something the oldest senshi had to guard against. It wasn&#39;t like the 
miko could hide the fact that she possessed the mask from Setsuna; the 
Senshi of Time didn&#39;t always know everything that went on in the world, 
but she knew enough. Rei dismissed the problem from her mind; it was 
simply another obstacle to be conquered when the time came.

Rei found herself in front of Setsuna&#146;s hospital room door-- the fake 
name borrowed from the miko&#39;s own surname and from her stint in Yokohama 
still tacked on to it. She shook her head slightly; how the youma hadn&#39;t 
seen through the lame alias by now was beyond her. The enemy certainly 
weren&#39;t very smart at all. That they hadn&#39;t attacked the bed-ridden 
Makoto or Haruka was credit to their lack of intelligence. Although, 
perhaps the youma were scared to after their last assassination attempt 
had been so easily repelled... with a little prophetic help.

The Senshi of Fire knocked softly on the door and then listened for 
Setsuna&#39;s expected call to enter. However, after a short period of time, 
the woman still hadn&#39;t acknowledged Rei&#39;s knock. Curious, and mildly 
concerned, the miko opened the door a little and peered around it, into 
the room. She saw that the hospital bed was empty, but with the sheets 
all ruffled, obviously having been used. Now worried that Setsuna could 
have been possibly kidnapped by a group of wised-up youma or something 
equally distressing, Rei cautiously entered the room, quickly scanning 
the area for any signs of trouble. The combat-ready girl then heard a 
flush from the bathroom followed by running water, and several seconds 
later the missing Outer Senshi staggered out of the bathroom, pausing in 
the doorway to hold on to the frame for support, the effort it took to 
walk apparently severely taxing the wounded green-haired woman.

Rei just stood there in the middle of the room, her posture still locked 
in an alert stance, while she blinked at Setsuna. Suddenly feeling a bit 
foolish for expecting the place to be trashed and youma to be leaping 
out of the walls from merely Setsuna&#39;s silence, the miko hastily moved 
to the Guardian of Time&#39;s side and slipped one arm around the injured 
woman&#39;s waist, allowing the oldest senshi to rest her weight on her.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Setsuna said softly, giving a small smile in gratitude 
while she draped one arm over Rei&#39;s shoulders.

Rei smiled back, and started to walk with the Guardian of Time back to 
the bed, supporting the woman. &quot;I guess you knew I&#39;d arrive to help 
you,&quot; Rei said wryly, glancing at Setsuna. For a spilt second, the miko 
thought she saw the Senshi of Time&#39;s complexion contain a hint of red, 
but it was gone so quickly the raven-haired girl decided she must have 
imagined it. This was Setsuna after all. Rei tightened her grip around 
the woman&#39;s waist marginally as she felt her hand slipping, being 
extremely careful not to disturb the Outer Senshi&#39;s multitude of 
injuries.

Setsuna exhaled deeply as Rei deposited her on the bed, tenderly easing 
her tired form down on top of the covers. The Guardian of Time 
repositioned her legs until they were underneath the bed sheets, and 
then Rei rearranged the blankets around the woman. Setsuna bowed her 
head briefly and appeared pained; Rei hoped that she hadn&#39;t aggravated 
any of her wounds.

&quot;There, all better,&quot; the miko said in satisfaction, patting Setsuna&#39;s 
lap with her hand while she moved to sit in the chair by the bed. To 
Rei&#39;s surprise, the green-haired woman placed one hand gently but 
insistently over the Senshi of Fire&#39;s own on her thighs, before the girl 
could withdraw it. Setsuna seemed surprised too, but shocked was 
probably a more accurate description.

The Senshi of Time blinked down at her hand on the miko&#39;s for several 
moments with minutely widened crimson eyes. She swallowed somewhat 
anxiously and then looked hastily at Rei. &quot;I...&quot; Setsuna began in a 
tremulous croak, but tapered off and blushed, the woman&#39;s cheeks turning 
a light pinkish hue, causing Rei&#146;s eyebrows to nearly crawl off her 
forehead.

&quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; Rei blurted out quickly, wishing to quell the Guardian 
of Time&#39;s rather disturbing embarrassment. She couldn&#39;t remember the 
last time she had seen Setsuna blush, if ever. Perhaps she hadn&#39;t 
imagined the earlier signs of one either. The Fire Senshi smirked 
inwardly though, it *was* kind of cute. &quot;Everyone needs some comfort now 
and then, especially after being hurt as badly as you have,&quot; she said. 
Rei then smiled ruefully and lowered her gaze. &quot;I certainly know the 
feeling.&quot;

Rei felt her hand being squeezed tenderly, making the girl more keenly 
aware of the older woman&#39;s warm one covering it. She raised her head and 
met Setsuna&#39;s sympathetic look. &quot;You certainly do,&quot; the Senshi of Time 
whispered sadly.

Rei was quiet as she stared into Setsuna&#39;s knowledgeable eyes, eyes that 
knew the possible future. There was something uncomfortable in the 
Guardian of Time&#39;s look, and the Fire Senshi felt a chill run down her 
spine. She abruptly broke their gaze, turning away from Setsuna and 
shaking her head, attempting to forestall the bleak and paranoid 
thoughts that threatened to creep into her mind.

&quot;Rei...&quot; Setsuna said quietly, stroking the raven-haired girl&#39;s hand 
beneath her own with her thumb, &quot;I have--&quot;

&quot;Setsuna-mama?&quot; said an inquisitive voice from the hospital room 
doorway.

Both Rei and Setsuna&#39;s heads snapped to the young girl standing by the 
open door, the pair obviously taken unawares. The Fire Senshi cursed 
herself for being so unobservant when she had sworn just two days ago to 
stay constantly alert. She was mildly surprised that the Guardian of 
Time had not expected Hotaru to show up; the woman&#39;s information on the 
future apparently wasn&#39;t always correct, but right now she appeared like 
a child caught with her hand in the cookie jar. Perhaps Setsuna had 
simply forgotten the encounter was to occur. It had to be hard knowing 
almost everything in the past, present, and future timelines without 
letting something slip your mind.

&quot;Hi, Hotaru,&quot; Rei said in a somewhat unsteady voice, recalling the lie 
she had told the Outer Senshi.

The Senshi of Rebirth looked at the miko for a second, and then glanced 
at Setsuna, and then once again looked at Rei. The pale girl then 
smiled, seeming very pleased about something. Setsuna hastily let go of 
Rei&#146;s hand and turned her head sharply to look out the window, her long 
green locks fluttering with the fast motion. Hotaru&#39;s smile grew and the 
young girl practically skipped into the room, before plopping herself 
down on the edge of the Senshi of Time&#39;s bed, next to Rei&#39;s still 
outstretched arm resting on the woman&#39;s lap.

&quot;Umm...&quot; Rei murmured uneasily while she retracted her hand, Hotaru 
continuing to smile somewhat disturbingly down at her. Sometimes Hotaru 
was just plain weird. Did the girl know the miko had lied to her, 
perhaps? All of a sudden Rei couldn&#39;t meet the Senshi of Rebirth&#146;s eyes 
anymore.

However, before Rei could ask about the pale girl&#39;s behaviour, Setsuna 
released a small gasp from her throat and quickly twisted her head 
around to face the Fire Senshi. Rei&#146;s brow creased in confusion as she 
gave the Guardian of Time a puzzled look, wondering just what was wrong 
with the two Outer Sailor Senshi she had met today. However, the miko&#39;s 
confusion soon turned to worry as the green-haired woman&#39;s crimson eyes 
appeared to cry out to the girl, imploring her, but for what reason Rei 
did not know. Setsuna slowly moved her gaze away from Rei and looked 
past Hotaru&#39;s small form, boring her eyes into the wall directly in 
front of the hospital bed. The Senshi of Fire glanced over her shoulder 
to see what the woman was finding so troubling, but failed to notice 
anything out of the ordinary. Setsuna continued her intense stare into 
the white washed wall however, occasionally flicking her crimson eyes 
between it and Rei.

&quot;Huh...?&quot; Rei said in total bafflement.

&quot;Setsuna-mama... are you okay?&quot; Hotaru asked with concern laced in the 
tone of her voice, the smile now gone and her features their usual 
sombre appearance.

Rei&#39;s frown deepened when Setsuna did not respond, instead merely 
keeping up her strange staring contest with the wall, only broken by 
bouts of shooting earnest looks at the Fire Senshi. Without warning, the 
miko suddenly felt a tickling in the back of her mind, a fleeting touch 
on her senses, senses tuned to the unnatural. To the abominable. It was 
just a flicker she felt, barely any vibe at all, but it was enough. Rei 
stood up with immediacy, causing the chair she had been sitting on to 
tumble over backwards onto the floor. Horrible comprehension finally 
dawned on the Inner Senshi as to what Setsuna was trying to tell her 
through pleading looks, the woman no doubt limited by the rules to not 
divulge any knowledge about the future to outsiders, but bending them 
nevertheless. The Guardian of Time was staring in the direction of 
Makoto&#39;s room. Makoto. Youma. Rei&#39;s eyes widened in alarm and her heart 
rate accelerated as Setsuna nodded briefly in confirmation of the girl&#39;s 
conclusions, the woman breathing a small sigh of relief.

The Senshi of Fire cursed loudly and bolted out of the room and into the 
hallway, sending a nurse sprawling in the process, causing the uniformed 
woman to cry out an indignant squawk. Hotaru jumped off the hospital bed 
and prepared to run after the spooked Inner Senshi, but found herself 
held back by a hand on one of her thin arms.

&quot;No. You must stay here with me,&quot; Setsuna said to the dark-haired girl 
firmly.

The Senshi of Rebirth looked to where Rei had run off to, appearing as 
if she didn&#39;t like the idea one bit. &quot;What&#39;s going on? Should I get 
Mamoru? He&#39;s with Haruka-papa,&quot; Hotaru said, continuing to stare out the 
doorway, watching the knocked over nurse clamber to her feet with the 
help of a doctor.

&quot;No, do *not* get him. And you&#39;ve done enough, Firefly; you did as I 
said, did you not? You used your talent like I suggested. Now you *must* 
remain here with me,&quot; the Guardian of Time went on insistently. &quot;...For 
as long as I can hold you...&quot; she added under her breath, joining Hotaru 
in looking through the doorway where Rei had swiftly departed, her 
expression grave.

Iason strolled along the halls of the human medical facility with his 
black-gloved hands in his dark blue suit pockets. This mission was all 
too easy, but the youma was enjoying it nonetheless; it had been quite a 
while since he had performed an assassination by his own hands, and he 
planned to savour the experience. While being Lord Makareus&#39; second in 
command was a distinguished position, it was mostly administrative work, 
tactical analyses, and operation coordination. A creature of Iason&#39;s 
calibre had to leave the drudgery behind now and then and get back to 
basics. He couldn&#39;t afford to let his skills in the art of murder to 
wane, especially in a position such as his. Other youma under Lord 
Makareus&#39; command were always backstabbing one another to further their 
own status in the demon&#39;s eyes, and Iason was more often than not a 
primary target. It was for this very reason that he had decided to 
undertake the task of executing Makoto Kino alone, in fear that his 
&#39;backup&#39; would end up viewing the mission as an opportunity to dispose 
of him. Of course, considering that Iason was still second in command, 
it would have to be a masterful plot to slay him or it would certainly 
fail utterly.

Iason stopped at a T intersection and discreetly tilted his head around 
the corner, surveying the entrance to the Sailor Senshi&#39;s room down the 
other hallway as nonchalant as possible. He saw another suspected Sailor 
Senshi talking to a human male who looked to serve as a guard for this 
facility. The youma recognised the female: Ami Mizuno, a suspected 
Sailor Senshi. It was believed she was harbouring other Sailor Senshi at 
her residence also, and an assault team was being formed at this very 
moment because of this. After the day&#39;s missions were complete, Lord 
Makareus wanted the homes of the possible Sailor Senshi and their 
friends cleaned out. But, if Mizuno was here at Minato General Hospital, 
it was a possibility that more Sailor Senshi were around as well. Iason 
already knew Haruka Ten&#39;ou was in the intensive care ward one floor up, 
and had planned to take the initiative and finish her off too, but if he 
had an opportunity to kill Mizuno also then he would gladly take it. In 
fact, it wasn&#39;t all that surprising that the girl would be near Kino. 
Iason knew of their &#39;affection&#39; for one another; the cunning youma had 
memorised all the available intelligence on the Sailor Senshi. Love... 
such a weakness. Maybe he would bury them together. If there was 
anything left to bury.

The creature smirked coldly as the blue-haired girl walked away with the 
guard in tow, making the youma&#39;s job even simpler. Pathetic. How the 
Sailor Senshi had lasted this long without being totally annihilated 
bewildered him. It was most likely due to the incompetence of his Lord&#39;s 
siblings. Once Mizuno and the hospital guard were out of sight, Iason 
walked casually down the hall towards Kino&#39;s door, and then silently 
opened it a crack. One purplish eye looked through the thin opening, and 
noted that the suspected senshi was lying in bed, breathing shallow and 
apparently asleep. Iason slipped inside the room and shut the door 
behind him quietly.

The youma sauntered over to Kino&#39;s bedside without so much as a whisper 
of noise and looked down at the unconscious girl. All too easy. Iason 
raised one arm and pointed his hand at the suspected Sailor Senshi, his 
fingertips stabbing directly out at the female&#39;s chest. It was a shame 
it had to be like this; the blue suited creature usually preferred to 
make his victims suffer before they died. Perhaps he could take his time 
with Mizuno or Ten&#39;ou.

Suddenly there was a flurry of motion under the bed covers, and 
something hard smashed into Iason&#39;s face. The youma cried out in more 
surprise than pain, staggering backwards away from the bed. He raised 
one black eyebrow as Sailor Jupiter pulled off the bed sheets from her 
uniformed body and hopped off the bed, onto the floor. There was a creak 
from a door to the right and another senshi Iason didn&#39;t recognise 
walked out of what appeared to be a lavatory. The dark-haired female 
grinned smugly at him and folded her arms. Yet another Sailor Senshi 
then arrived through the hospital room door, and the youma recognised 
her as Sailor Mercury. Mercury shut the door closed, leaving Iason 
surrounded in the small room by three Sailor Senshi.

So. It was a trap, was it? Iason glanced between the triumvirate of 
Sailor Senshi impassively. He had enough knowledge on the enemy to know 
that Makoto Kino was Sailor Jupiter, and Ami Mizuno was Sailor Mercury, 
but even with that understanding he found it hard to find any 
similarities between the two females and their normal alter egos. It was 
like his mind was being clouded when he tried to compare the physical 
attributes of Kino with Jupiter, and Mizuno with Mercury. It was 
difficult to keep focused and believe each were one in the same, despite 
how blatantly obvious it was. It must have been some innate defence to 
keep the Sailors&#39; true identities secret from the human populace.

&quot;I bet you didn&#39;t see that one coming,&quot; Sailor Jupiter said with a 
smirk, rubbing the knuckles of one clenched fist. She glanced at her 
blue-haired mate. &quot;Did you send the security guard away?&quot; Jupiter 
inquired.

Sailor Mercury nodded to the tall female. &quot;Yes. He&#39;ll be safe for the 
time being.&quot; She returned her gaze to the &#39;trapped&#39; creature. &quot;Are you 
sure he is actually a youma?&quot; Mercury then asked.

&quot;Positive,&quot; replied the unknown senshi confidently, taking a few steps 
closer to Iason. &quot;And he&#39;s the only one nearby.&quot;

The three girls were silent for a moment, merely looking at the youma 
masquerading as a human. Finally, Jupiter spoke. &quot;So... what do we do 
with him?&quot; she said.

&quot;If he&#39;s susceptible to interrogation, then we can use him to lead us to 
the enemy&#39;s headquarters,&quot; suggested Sailor Mercury.

Iason smiled conceitedly and spread out his arms in a gesture of 
surrender. They thought they had him, did they? How arrogant. &quot;I assure 
you, I will comply to all inquiries,&quot; he said patronisingly, inclining 
his head slightly in a brief nod of feigned submission.

&quot;Yeah, sure you will,&quot; the unknown Sailor Senshi sneered sarcastically.

&quot;Indeed I will,&quot; Iason answered in a condescending voice. &quot;I will even 
grant you some information you will no doubt find... interesting, 
without being prompted to. As a gesture of good faith,&quot; he smiled 
smugly.

Once he was sure all three humans&#146; full attention was on him, the youma 
continued. &quot;By tonight, I do believe that Juuban High School will have 
to close... due to the lack of a sufficient number of students,&quot; he said 
in an off-handed tone.

&quot;What the hell do you mean?&quot; Sailor Jupiter growled threateningly.

&quot;As we speak, your fellows are being butchered!&quot; Iason snarled with 
macabre satisfaction, his expression suddenly changing into one of 
demonic glee. &quot;And their weak classmates with them!&quot; He looked up at the 
ceiling with rapture painted all over his face. &quot;Such a massacre of the 
like your pitiful planet has never seen. It will be remembered as a 
glorious day once my kind rules this world! Enough blood will be spilt 
in that school to fill an ocean!!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re lying!&quot; the mystery Sailor Senshi shouted vehemently, her 
trembling fists balled tightly by her sides. &quot;You&#39;d say anything to save 
your skin! YOU&#39;RE LYING!!&quot;

Iason laughed maliciously at the girl&#39;s reaction, his chuckles echoing 
around the room. &quot;It&#39;s already started. There are enough youma in Juuban 
High School to assemble an army!&quot; he cried in triumph. &quot;Teachers, 
students... no one will see it coming. The walls will run red with their 
blood, the halls will sing with their screams. Your friends are DEAD! 
DEAD!!&quot;

The unknown Sailor Senshi gritted her teeth and then abruptly ran like 
the wind past Iason to the hospital room door, barging past Mercury. She 
threw open the door hard, the thing nearly coming off its hinges, and 
then raced down the hall, her furious shouts at people to get the hell 
out of the way trailing loudly behind her.

&quot;Shit. You bastard,&quot; Sailor Jupiter cursed viciously at the sadistically 
ecstatic youma, the creature still sniggering maniacally.

Iason shook his head from side to side, amazed at how incredibly stupid 
the Sailor Senshi were. The other senshi&#39;s little outburst and 
subsequent flight had reduced his &#39;captors&#39; numbers to two. Sure, he had 
revealed what was happening at Juuban High School, but there was nothing 
one Sailor Senshi could do to stop it. Her corpse would join the 
countless others in the slaughter. Now that Iason&#39;s presence was known, 
stealth was no longer an issue and could be ignored. The creature&#39;s 
laughter abruptly cut off and he smiled frostily, his dramatic 
performance for the enemy&#39;s benefit at its end. Juuban High wasn&#39;t the 
only building whose walls would be painted with blood.

&quot;Your friends are dead...&quot; Iason repeated softly, causing both Mercury 
and Jupiter to glower defiantly at him, but he could see the fear in 
their eyes. &quot;Your friends are dead... AND SO ARE YOU!&quot; The youma flicked 
his arms straight out to the sides, letting a long razor-sharp 
monofilament shoot out from each of his fingertips. He lashed the almost 
invisible wires like whips, ripping thin, perfect gashes in the floor as 
if it were butter, and then launched all ten instruments of death at the 
two stunned Sailor Senshi.
