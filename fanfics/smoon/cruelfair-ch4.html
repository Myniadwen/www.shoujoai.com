<h1>The Cruelty and Fairness of Fate (part 4 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a>

<a href="../smoon/cruelfair-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>	Makoto fidgeted as she waited for the pharmacist to fill her 
prescription.  She knew it was mostly her imagination, but she felt 
like everyone was staring at her.  Why were there this many people 
in the drugstore anyway?  It was a nice Saturday afternoon.  Didn&#146;t 
they all have someplace better to be?
	She got up and walked a few feet so she could see out the door.  
Ami was outside waiting for her, but Makoto couldn&#146;t see her from 
here.
	&#147;Kino.&#148;
	Makoto turned when the pharmacist called her name.  She took 
the bag the man handed her, ignoring the disapproving look he wore 
at the sight of her bare ring finger.  She paid quickly and went 
outside to look for Ami.
	After several seconds, Makoto spotted Ami outside the 
bookstore across the street.  She had picked up a book from the 
outdoor display and looked to be lost within its pages.
	&#147;Looks like it has you pretty interested,&#148; said Makoto as she 
walked up to Ami.  &#147;May I?&#148; she asked, holding out her hand.
	Ami closed the book and handed it to Makoto.  &#145;Raindrops in 
the Garden &amp; Other Short Stories&#146; was written in shiny green script 
across the cover.  Makoto smiled, then took the book and went inside 
the store.
	&#147;Mako-chan?&#148; questioned Ami, following behind her.
	&#147;You like it, right?&#148;
	Ami nodded at Makoto&#146;s question.
	&#147;Well, I&#146;m buying it for you.  It&#146;s a thank you for my snack 
fairy.&#148;
	&#147;You don&#146;t have to do that.&#148;
	&#147;I know.  But, you see, she&#146;s been really good to me 
recently,&#148; explained Makoto, &#147;and I&#146;ve been pretty rotten to her.  
She keeps forgiving me, though.&#148;
	Makoto paid the clerk, then turned to a quiet Ami.  Ami was 
never terribly talkative, but ever since their phone conversation 
Wednesday night, she&#146;d barely said three words to Makoto.
	That phone call had been a disaster, Makoto thought.  She had 
yelled long and loud at Ami, not caring about what the girl had gone 
through for her.  All Makoto heard was that one more person knew her 
secret, and Ami was the one who had told.
	That conversation had ended with a teary sounding Ami saying 
she was sorry and would Makoto please call the doctor anyway.  As 
soon as she hung up the phone, Makoto had begun to feel guilty.
	The next day at school, Makoto had pulled Ami aside and told 
her how sorry she was.  When she thanked Ami for her and her 
mother&#146;s help it was with an honest gratefulness.  She&#146;d even 
already called the doctor&#146;s office.  Her appointment was Saturday at 
2:00 pm, and if Ami wasn&#146;t still upset with her would she please go 
with her.
	Ami had nodded and said of course she would.  And Makoto was 
forgiven, because Ami understood.  The apology had been given and 
accepted, yet to Makoto things still felt wrong somehow.
	Ami accepted the gift Makoto handed to her.  &#147;Thank you,&#148; she 
said.
	They walked together in silence for a while, until Makoto 
couldn&#146;t take it anymore.  &#147;I&#146;m not mad at you anymore,&#148; she blurted 
out of nowhere.
	Ami looked at her questioningly.  &#147;I didn&#146;t think you where, 
Mako-chan.&#148;
	&#147;You&#146;re acting like you do,&#148; answered Makoto.  &#147;Ever since 
Wednesday night.  I know I handled that badly, Ami.  I mean, if 
anyone should be angry, it&#146;s you.  You keep doing all this stuff for 
me, now your mom, too, and all I do is yell at you and get you in 
trouble.&#148;
	&#147;It&#146;s okay, Mako-chan.  I&#133;&#148;
	Makoto cut her off.  &#147;Don&#146;t say you understand.  Yell, scream, 
call me names for using you, anything.  Just stop saying it&#146;s okay 
and that you understand.&#148;
	&#147;All right.  You&#146;re an ingrate, Kino Makoto,&#148; said Ami, a grin 
tugging at the corners of her mouth.  &#147;Feel better, now?&#148;
	&#147;Not really,&#148; said Makoto.  &#147;But I&#146;d rather listen to you call 
me names than not have you saying anything to me at all.
	&#147;I know I&#146;ve said it before,&#148; went on Makoto, &#147;but I really am 
sorry about that night.  All I kept thinking was that more people 
knew, and I haven&#146;t even told anyone yet.  This is all happening to 
me and it&#146;s like I have absolutely no control over any of it.  I 
don&#146;t like that feeling.  You were just the unfortunate one who was 
there when I cut loose.&#148;
	&#147;You&#146;re forgiven, Mako-chan.  Honestly,&#148; said Ami with a grin.
	&#147;Maybe, but I still want to do something to thank you.  Your 
mom, too.  That book is just a token.&#148;  Makoto thought for a minute.  
&#147;I know.  When things settle down a bit and your mom has a free 
night, I&#146;ll make dinner for you.  Something big, with all of your 
favorites.  Dessert, too.  There&#146;s this recipe I found for a 
chocolate-peanut butter cake I want to try.  This&#146;ll give me a great 
excuse.&#148;
	Right on cue, Makoto&#146;s stomach grumbled.
	Ami giggled.  &#147;I guess we know where that idea came from.&#148;
	Makoto grinned sheepishly.  &#147;I am kind of hungry.  Do you 
think we have time to stop for a burger before we go to Haruka&#146;s?&#148;
	&#147;I don&#146;t see why not,&#148; answered Ami.  &#147;Everything for the 
party was pretty much done by last night, from what you told me.  
All we have to do is stop by your apartment to get the cake and drop 
it off before we go to the high school.&#148;
	&#147;Great.&#148;  Makoto smiled teasingly at Ami.  &#147;You know, it&#146;s 
probably a good thing you got grounded this week.  Because even with 
Minako and Rei gone, if you&#146;d actually shown up at the meeting, we 
would have wound up studying.  I never would have had time to finish 
the cake, then.&#148;
	Ami sighed.  &#147;It&#146;s good for you, perhaps, but Usagi is going 
to fail her next English test.  In any case, I&#146;m just glad no one 
asked what was so important at home that I couldn&#146;t make it to the 
meetings.&#148;
	Makoto nodded at Ami, deciding it would be a bad idea to tell 
her their friends had actually wondered about it.  They were just 
too polite to pry beyond the &#145;Ami wants to spend time with her mom&#146; 
excuse Makoto had given them.

	Aika walked back stage to the area that had been designated 
the girls&#146; dressing room.  &#147;Hey, Minako,&#148; she called happily, &#147;I 
think your stalker is escalating.&#148;  She set the bouquet of peach 
colored roses on the table in front of Minako.
	&#147;Thanks, Aika.&#148;  Minako pulled out the little note card and 
smiled hugely.
	Aika&#146;s voice had brought over the other girls in the room.  
They gathered around Minako, ohhing and ahhing at her latest gift 
from her mystery fan.
	 &#147;So what does it say this time?&#148; asked one of the girls.
	&#147;Same as every other time,&#148; answered Minako.  &#147;&#146;Break a leg 
and I&#146;ll bring the jam.  Signed, Moldy Bread.&#146;&#148;
	&#147;That&#146;s somehow less than romantic,&#148; said Aika.  &#147;Couldn&#146;t he 
profess his undying love of your beauty and talent?  Or at the very 
least say what kind of ice cream he plans on hiding your severed 
digits behind.&#148;
	&#147;Jeez, Aika!&#148; complained one of the girls.
	&#147;Forget the sentiment,&#148; said Yukari.  &#147;I want to know who 
keeps sending these roses.  Spill, Minako.  Who&#146;s the mystery guy?&#148;
	Minako&#146;s smile turned secretive.  She turned from the girls 
and went back to fixing her makeup.
	The girls groaned collectively.  Minako heard mutterings about 
the unfairness of it all as Aika set them back to their tasks.
	Minako knew who the roses were from, of course.  Rei hadn&#146;t 
actually tried to be secretive when they were alone.  &#147;Just 
because,&#148; Rei had said when Minako asked about the single peach rose 
and note card that were left on her dressing table opening night.  
Each night since then, there had been a rose and note waiting for 
her.  Thus the teasing about a mysterious stalker fan.
	Minako reached over and fingered one of the soft petals.  
There were half a dozen this time rather than the singles she&#146;d 
gotten the other five nights.  She wondered why the extravagance 
tonight.
	Looking over her shoulder at the other girls, Minako wondered 
what would happen if she told them about Rei.  What would they say 
if she told them about the silky black hair that framed a beautiful 
face with deep and mysterious purple eyes?  Eyes that could always 
see into her soul and know all the things she tried to hide from 
others.  Would they sigh with envy if she tried to describe the soft 
lips and gentle hands that held her and took away all the hurt and 
burdens she carried around with her for so long?
	They would envy her, she thought.  They would also giggle at 
the girlish romanticism of it all and then proceed to spread the 
news of how Aino Minako was in love with the psychic girl from TA.  
That was the sole reason she kept quiet about her mystery fan.
	Very simply, Minako&#146;s parents didn&#146;t know about her and Rei.  
It was very likely that if the collective of the school found out, 
it would eventually reach her parents as well.  After all, the 
parents gossiped as much as their children.  Minako just wasn&#146;t 
ready to deal with their reactions, yet.  And while there were those 
who knew, Rei&#146;s grandfather included, Minako felt relatively secure 
that those people would never cross paths with her parents.
	&#147;All right, everybody,&#148; called Aika, &#147;it&#146;s time.  Tonight, we 
go out with a bang.&#148;
	A wave of excitement rose up as the students filed out to take 
their places on the stage.  So occupied where they, that no one 
noticed a pair of amber eyes staring out from a dark corner or the 
low hiss that issued from their owner.


*            *            *

	Hotaru sat in the windows outside the auditorium waiting for 
Chibi-usa.  Michiru and Setsuna were inside, holding seats for 
everyone.  Haruka was with Hotaru out in the hall.
	Hotaru looked over to where her Haruka-papa had been corned by 
some fans.  She was rather enthusiastically relating something to 
the girls who had gathered around her.  Hotaru grinned and lifted 
the camera she had hanging around her neck.  She snapped a picture 
as the young girls continued to moon over her papa.
	Keeping the camera to her eye, Hotaru gazed at the people 
milling about in the hallway.  Her lens landed first on an old woman 
standing patiently by a display case.  A teenaged boy dressed as a 
butcher put a hand on the woman&#146;s shoulder.  She startled, but her 
expression became happy and she put her arms around him.
	&lt;Snap.&gt;  Hotaru smiled.  That would be a good one.
	Moving her focus further down the hall, Hotaru saw another boy 
about the same age as the butcher.  He was dressed in baggy jeans 
and a dark green t-shirt.  Headphones were on his ears, and he was 
playing something on a green Gameboy, yet his expression and the way 
he slouched against the wall made him appear to be very bored.
	&lt;Snap.&gt;
	Her lens next caught a little girl running into the hall from 
another part of the building.  She was wearing a school uniform, but 
Hotaru didn&#146;t know what school it was from.  The girl&#146;s hair was 
dark brown and came just past her shoulders.  And on top of her 
head&#133;
	&#147;Cat ears?&#148; mumbled Hotaru to herself.
	Before Hotaru could snap a picture of the girl, a face popped 
up into her viewfinder.
	Hotaru bobbled her camera.  Balancing it, she frowned at the 
boy in front of her.  He had blond hair, brown eyes, and a playful 
smile.
	The boy blithely ignored the look Hotaru was giving him for 
interrupting her shot.  &#147;Hi,&#148; he said, &#147;my name&#146;s Ti.  What&#146;s 
yours?&#148;
	&#147;Hotaru.&#148;
	&#147;That&#146;s a neat camera, Hotaru,&#148; went on Ti.  &#147;Where&#146;d you get 
it?&#148;
	Hotaru&#146;s mood towards the boy quickly lightened as he brought 
up her current favorite thing.  &#147;My Setsuna-mama bought it for me 
for summer vacation.  Michiru-mama plays the violin, and she went on 
tour.  I went with her and Haruka-papa, and Setsuna-mama wanted me 
to be able to take my own pictures of the trip.&#148;
	&#147;Wow.  You have a lot of parents.&#148;
	&#147;So,&#148; said Hotaru defensively.
	&#147;I think it&#146;s cool.  I only have my brothers and sister,&#148; said 
Ti, pointing to the boy with the green Gameboy.  Next to the boy now 
stood an older boy dressed all in black and the little girl with cat 
ears.  &#147;But Shin gets us stuff to play with all the time,&#148; continued 
Ti.  He stuck his hand in his pocket and pulled out a blue and white 
rubber ball.  &#147;See, he just got me this last week.&#148;
	&#147;Ti!  Get over here!&#148; called Shin.
	&#147;Awww, but I was gonna see if she wanted to play,&#148; Ti called 
back.
	&#147;You can play later.  Let&#146;s go.&#148;
	Ti shrugged his shoulders.  &#147;Sorry,&#148; he said to Hotaru, then 
ran to his brother.
	Hotaru put the camera back to her eye and watched as Ti and 
his siblings went into the auditorium.  The older brother, Shin, 
unnerved her.  He looked about the same age as her papa, but stood 
at least a head taller.  His hair was as black as his clothes, and a 
small goatee gave him a sinister look.  His eyes were dark as well.  
Not the soft brown of his little brother&#146;s, but nearly as dark as 
the depths of space.
	A high-pitched voice calling her name got Hotaru&#146;s attention.  
She aimed her camera in the direction it had come from and caught 
Chibi-usa in her sights.  Hotaru smiled.
	&lt;Snap.&gt;
	As the film began to rewind itself, Hotaru ran to greet her 
friend.


*            *            *

	Minako stood and stared in shock at the shredded roses that 
lay scattered on her dressing table.  The top of the table was a 
mess, water from the flowers and makeup mixed among the remains of 
the roses.
	Yukari put a hand on Minako&#146;s shoulder.  &#147;Aww, Minako.  They 
were such pretty flowers, too.  Who would do something like this?&#148;
	&#147;Minako,&#148; started one of the girls hesitantly, &#147;you do know 
who&#146;s sending you these, right?&#148;
	&#147;Yes, I know,&#148; answered Minako, understanding what an 
overactive imagination was causing her friend to ask.  &#147;They 
wouldn&#146;t do something like this.&#148;
	&#147;It wasn&#146;t a &#145;they&#146;,&#148; said Aika.  &#147;It was a &#145;what.&#146;  If I had 
to guess by the paw marks, I&#146;d say a cat,&#148; she explained, pointing 
to the paw prints left in the mess on the tabletop.  &#147;I&#146;m sorry, 
Minako.  I left the window open.  It must have come in through 
there.&#148;
	&#147;It&#146;s not your fault, Aika,&#148; said Minako sadly.  &#147;And this is 
going to be a pain to clean up.&#148;
	&#147;The sooner we get started&#133;&#148; said Yukari.  She went over to 
the table and bent to right the overturned chair.  Instead she stood, 
a bright smile on her face.
	&#147;Hey, Minako,&#148; said Yukari, &#147;look what I found.  And it looks 
like it survived pretty much intact.&#148;
	Minako took the rose Yukari held out to her.  &#147;Thank you,&#148; she 
said, happier to have at least one to keep with her.


*            *            *

	&#147;It looked like Artemis had a temper tantrum,&#148; Minako 
explained to her friends as they walked to the parking lot.
	The entire group was together tonight.  They were headed back 
to the Outers&#146; house, ostensibly for a spur of the moment, take-out 
dinner.  In truth, Setsuna&#146;s clan had offered their house for the 
party the girls wanted to throw for Minako.
	The school parking lot was all but deserted as they tried to 
figure out how to fit ten people and two cats into Haruka&#146;s and 
Setsuna&#146;s cars.
	Minako was leaning up against the door of Setsuna&#146;s car, 
tapping the surviving rose absently against her cheek, when a small 
hand took hold of her arm.  She looked down and saw a little girl 
about Hotaru&#146;s age with costume cat ears on her head.
	The little girl grinned up at Minako.  &#147;Hi.  My name&#146;s Kei, 
and I thought you were really great in the play.&#148;


	Hotaru followed behind Chibi-usa, her arms outstretched for 
balance.  Together, they tightrope-walked along the logs that ran 
the perimeter of the parking lot as they waited to be told who they 
were to ride with.
	A small bark got the girls&#146; attention.  They knelt down to the 
puppy it had come from.
	&#147;Aren&#146;t you cute,&#148; said Chibi-usa to the little golden 
retriever.  She scratched the top of his head.
	The puppy barked as if to agree.  His tail wagging gleefully, 
the puppy ran over to the grass and picked something up in his mouth.  
Then he ran back over to the girls and dropped the blue and white 
rubber ball in front of them.
	&#147;Do you want to play with me, now?&#148; asked the puppy.
	Both girls stared wide-eyed in shock.  Then something clicked 
in Hotaru&#146;s mind.  &#147;Ti?&#148;


	Makoto sighed in frustration.  They had been so careful in 
planning everything out.  Why hadn&#146;t anyone thought about the 
driving arrangements?  She was just about to suggest that some of 
them walk when she noticed the little girl talking to Minako.  She 
squinted her eyes, thinking maybe they were playing tricks on her in 
the twilight.
	&#147;Hey, Rei,&#148; said Makoto, nudging the dark haired girl beside 
her, &#147;look at the kid over there with Minako.  Is it my imagination 
or does she have a tail?&#148;
	Rei turned to look at her girlfriend.  When she saw the child, 
her mind flashed quickly to a stone room, a large bed, and a kitten 
lying in a pile of pillows.  Rei cursed under her breath and started 
for Minako, only to be stopped as a teenage boy stepped in front of 
her.
	His grin was less than friendly as he said, &#147;That&#146;s my sister 
over there.  She likes your friend, but I think I like you better.&#148;


	From the shadows, Shin watched as his younger siblings found 
their desired targets.  The playroom was already a bit cluttered, 
but he supposed a few more additions couldn&#146;t hurt.  Besides, this 
would be a good exercise in how and not how to get the things you 
wanted.
	The black dog that was Shin&#146;s true form relaxed into the 
shadows and waited.


	Kei&#146;s head turned quickly when she heard her brother&#146;s words.  
Her grin turned to a scowl as she glared at him.  &#147;Not that one, Kai!  
I don&#146;t like her!&#148;
	Kai huffed at his little sister.  &#147;Like I care.&#148;
	&#147;I said no!&#148;  Kei&#146;s grip tightened on Minako&#146;s arm, her nails 
digging into the skin.
	&#147;Ow!  Let go,&#148; said Minako, trying to pull away.  The child&#146;s 
grip was like iron.  Little rivulets of blood began to drip from 
where her nails were digging in.
	Kei turned back to Minako.  Her lips were pulled into a feral 
grin, her eyes glowing amber in her anger.   &#147;I said I liked you.  I 
plan on keeping you,&#148; said the girl, a slight hiss to her tone.
	Kai was steadfastly ignoring his sister, instead focusing on 
Rei.  &#147;How about you come home with me,&#148; he said as he advanced 
slowly.  To make his point, a low growl emanated from his throat and 
his eyes glowed a pale red.
	Before he could get very far, Kai was hit by a ball of bright 
orange light.  He was knocked off his feet and landed against the 
concrete wall of a storage shed.  The boy slumped to the ground, not 
moving.
	Makoto, Ami, and Usagi turned to see Setsuna, Haruka, and 
Michiru already transformed.  Rei didn&#146;t bother looking at what she 
knew she&#146;d see.  Her attention was instead on Minako and the cat 
girl.
	Kei had Minako on her knees.  One hand clutched at Minako&#146;s 
throat, the other still gripped her arm.  Rei could see Minako 
struggling to stay conscious as her air was being cut off.
	Without hesitation, Rei charged forward and tackled Kei.  The 
girl screeched as her grip on Minako was lost.  Minako fell the rest 
of the way to the ground, coughing and gasping as Rei rolled with 
Kei.
	Uranus&#146; World Shaking slamming into Kai had drawn the 
attention of the ones across the parking lot.  Shin looked up from 
his place in the shadows.
	&#147;Well, that was unexpected,&#148; he said to himself.  Kai&#146;s target 
was already heading for Kei, and Ti&#146;s two were getting ready to join 
her.  &#147;Not exactly fair, now is it?&#148;
	Shin turned first to his youngest charge.  Might as well let 
Ti play with his toys rather than have them add to the fray.  Shin&#146;s 
eyes glowed bright red as he stared at Ti and the girls.  His 
chuckle was a low growl as Chibi-usa ran head first into the barrier 
that appeared around the three.
	Rei was struggling on the ground with a  scratching and 
hissing Kei.  Uranus and Neptune began to move toward them when Shin 
jumped into their path.  The two braced to fight the snarling black 
dog.
	Movement by the shed where Kai had fallen caught Usagi&#146;s 
attention.  She grabbed Makoto&#146;s arm, frantically pointing out the 
boy as he slowly rose to his hands and knees.  His lips pulled back 
in a snarl and his features filled out to resemble a shaggy German 
Sheppard.  His red eyes locked on to the three who were staring at 
him.
	Setsuna stepped between them, giving the girls the opportunity 
they needed.  Makoto grabbed Usagi and Ami and pulled them off to 
the side.  &#147;Come on.  We have to transform.&#148;
	Usagi nodded, her brooch appearing in her hand.  Ami hesitated, 
however, a worried look on her face.
	Makoto noticed and shook her head at her friend.  &#147;There&#146;s no 
time for that, Ami.  Transform.&#148;
	Ami held back her argument and called her henshin pen.  Duty 
first, she reminded herself, a speech Luna had given them not so 
long ago coming back to her.
	The other two in the midst of their transformations, Makoto 
held her henshin pen before her.  &#147;Jupiter Crystal Power, Make-up!&#148; 
she called out.  She could feel the slight physical change that 
signaled her transformation beginning.  The familiar feeling of 
light and power began to envelop her.  And then abruptly stopped.
	Makoto blinked in confusion at the henshin pen in her hand.  
She looked at the other two, now transformed.  They looked as 
confused as she felt.  Once again she held the pen before her and 
called out her transformation phrase.
	Nothing happened.
	From the parking lot, they heard Neptune scream.  It was 
followed by an angry yell from Uranus.
	&#147;Go,&#148; said Makoto.  &#147;Don&#146;t worry about me.  Just help them.&#148;
	Sailors Moon and Mercury obeyed their friend&#146;s command and ran 
to help the others.
	Makoto watched as they left, her hand wrapped so tightly 
around her now useless henshin pen that her knuckles were turning 
white.
	Chibi-usa and Hotaru were stuck inside the enclosure Shin had 
trapped them in.  They pounded against it futilely, screaming to be 
let out, as Ti yipped excitedly and jumped around their feet.  Shin 
was now staring down Pluto, while Kai had made a lunge for Neptune.  
He had managed to get his teeth into her leg.  Ami was certain he 
was going to regret that as Uranus unleashed a Space Sword Blaster 
at him.  Uranus&#146; attack landed and Kai was thrown once again, 
landing with a pitiful yelp against a tree.
	Ami looked over and saw Rei.  The miko was still struggling 
with Kei, who, while still in human form, had taken on more felinoid 
features.  Her fingernails were long and sharp as they slashed 
across Rei&#146;s chest.  Her fangs were obvious as she hissed her anger 
at her opponent.
	Just as Kei&#146;s arm came up with the intention of raking across 
Rei&#146;s face, Venus&#146; Love Me Chain wrapped around her arm.  The action 
caught both girls by surprise, and they looked over to see Venus 
glaring daggers at Kei.  With a sharp tug, Venus pulled Kei off of 
Rei.  The cat girl yowled as she landed hard against the ground.
	The pained cries from his two younger charges pulled Shin&#146;s 
attention away from Pluto.  Kai was closer to Ti now, struggling to 
get up.  His right front leg was giving him no support and looking 
from Shin&#146;s perspective as if it were broken.  Kei was on her back, 
dazed.  Her plaything had transformed like the others and was 
looking very unhappy.  And here there were two more running in to 
make things worse.
	Shin ground his fangs together.  This was too much trouble to 
go through just so the kids could have a few more toys to play with.  
His decision made, Shin turned from Pluto and started running 
towards Kei.
	Reverting back to his human form as he moved, Shin pushed a 
wobbly Venus aside and grabbed Kei by her shirt collar.  He hauled 
her up and headed towards the other two, ignoring his little 
sister&#146;s protests.
	&#147;Kai!  On your feet!  We&#146;re going home,&#148; called Shin.  A 
portal quickly opened near Kai.  &#147;Ti, say goodbye to your friends.&#148;
	Kai managed to limp the few feet to the portal and stumbled 
through.  Ti whined in disappointment, but obeyed his older brother 
and made a run for the portal as soon as the barrier dropped.  Shin 
and Kei followed on Ti&#146;s heels, and the portal closed a second later.
	Those Senshi who needed to detransformed.  Michiru was leaning 
against Haruka, trying to keep the weight off her injured leg.  
Minako leaned against Setsuna&#146;s car and slid to the ground.  Rei 
quickly joined her, the two checking each other for injuries.
	&#147;Guess I had a stalker fan after all,&#148; said Minako with a 
weary chuckle.  There was bruising around her neck and bleeding 
puncture wounds in her arm from Kei&#146;s claws.
	Minako frowned and gingerly lifted a finger to Rei&#146;s face.  
She let it hover, not wanting to hurt the girl by touching the 
scraped bruise on her cheek.  Minako panicked when she saw the 
slashes across Rei&#146;s chest.
	Rei took the blonde&#146;s hand and smiled.  &#147;That little brat 
ruined my jacket and I think there may be some pulls in my shirt, 
but she didn&#146;t break skin.&#148;
	Minako sighed in relief.
	Hotaru had run up to Michiru.  The little girl had an arm 
around her mama&#146;s waist, feeling as if she were offering some 
support even though Michiru&#146;s full weight was on Haruka.
	Setsuna was wrapping a handkerchief around the bite on 
Michiru&#146;s calf, telling the young woman she should probably go to 
the hospital, just to be safe.  Michiru, for her part, was doing her 
best stubborn Haruka imitation by refusing and saying they could 
treat it well enough on their own.
	Makoto was walking slowly towards the group.  Ami saw her, but 
stayed still, not know what to say or do.  Usagi, on the other hand, 
ran up to the girl, full of questions.
	&#147;What happened, Mako-chan?&#148; asked Usagi, her concern evident.  
&#147;Why didn&#146;t you transform?&#148;
	&#147;I&#133; I don&#146;t know,&#148; answered Makoto.  &#147;I tried, but&#133;&#148;
	From where she stood, Ami could see one of Makoto&#146;s walls 
begin to crack.  Makoto&#146;s right hand flexed around the henshin pen 
she still held.  As tears of defeat filled Makoto&#146;s eyes, Ami 
hurried over to her.
	All of her anger and frustration came to the surface as the 
others watched her.  Makoto looked into the face of her princess, 
feeling as if she had failed the girl utterly.  When Ami&#146;s warm hand 
touched her arm, Makoto lost it.
	She shook off Ami&#146;s hand and raised her arm.  Her henshin pen 
hit the ground with a loud clatter and rolled away.  &#147;Damn it!  I 
don&#146;t want it this way!&#148;  Makoto sank to her knees, Ami going with 
her.  &#147;This isn&#146;t what I wanted.  I only wanted someone to stay.&#148;
	Ami put her arms loosely around Makoto as the taller girl&#146;s 
head rested on her shoulder.  Ami&#146;s heart ached for her friend as 
Makoto cried quietly.
	The others didn&#146;t know what to do, completely lost at what was 
going on before them.  It was Luna who finally broke the trance 
everyone had seemingly lapsed into when the usually strong Makoto 
broke down.
	Luna walked silently up to the girls, stopping Usagi from 
bending down to them.  The black cat watched for a moment, hearing 
Makoto apologize over and over as she cried.  &#147;Mako-chan,&#148; she said 
quietly.
	Makoto looked down at Luna.  Their eyes held for several 
seconds.  Then Luna shook her head in disappointment.  She wouldn&#146;t 
have thought the girl to be so careless as to let something like 
this happen.
	Luna turned to the group.  &#147;We&#146;re having an emergency meeting 
at Makoto&#146;s.  We&#146;ll get you all bandaged up there.  Setsuna, I would 
appreciate it if the Outers came as well.&#148;
	Setsuna nodded her agreement.
	That decided, the group split up between the two cars and 
headed to Makoto&#146;s.


*            *            *

	As soon as they got to the apartment, Luna and Makoto 
disappeared into Makoto&#146;s bedroom.  The others spread out around the 
living room as Haruka and Ami administered first aid to those who 
needed it.
	Haruka was carefully wrapping a bandage around Michiru&#146;s leg.  
Even with her rapid healing ability, it would take a few days for 
the swelling and marks to go away completely.  Not to mention that 
senshi healing did nothing to alleviate the sting of peroxide on an 
open wound.
	Minako was getting similar attention from Ami and Rei.  She 
winced as Ami dabbed on the peroxide, then again as raised voices 
floated in from the bedroom.  The words were too muffled to 
understand, but the noise was enough to have everyone on edge.
	&#147;What&#146;s going on?&#148; Minako asked Ami quietly.  &#147;I know you know, 
and that you haven&#146;t told us everything.  How sick is she really?&#148;
	Quiet in a small room didn&#146;t really count for much.  Haruka 
proved this by turning her head to them and asking, &#147;She&#146;s sick?  
What&#146;s wrong with her?&#148;
	&#147;She has anemia,&#148; answered Usagi from her place on the floor.  
&#147;But she said it was under control.  That&#146;s right, isn&#146;t it, Ami?&#148;
	Ami bowed her head even further to Minako&#146;s arm, suddenly 
finding her bandage the most interesting thing.  She chewed on her 
lip as she tried to ignore her friends&#146; questions.
	As the others pushed Ami for an answer, Chibi-usa went over to 
Setsuna.  &#147;Puu,&#148; whispered the pink haired girl, &#147;I know why senshi 
can&#146;t transform sometimes.  And I think I know why Mama sent me here 
now.&#148;  Chibi-usa looked to a suddenly quiet hallway.  &#147;My Jupiter 
tells me about it sometimes.  And Mama reminded me that I wasn&#146;t 
supposed to talk about this at all while I&#146;m here because if they 
knew about it before it happened then it wouldn&#146;t happen at all.  
And they need each other too much for it not to.&#148;
	Setsuna smiled at the girl.  &#147;I believe you&#146;re right, Small 
Lady.  But take care that you don&#146;t accidentally disobey your 
mother.&#148;
	&#147;What are you two whispering about over there?&#148; called Haruka.
	&#147;Nothing of importance,&#148; answered Setsuna.
	&#147;I don&#146;t believe that,&#148; said Michiru.  &#147;You two know 
something.&#148;
	&#147;I wouldn&#146;t be surprised if they did,&#148; said Makoto as she 
entered the living room.  &#147;Everyone seems to be finding out without 
me having to tell them.&#148;
	Luna jumped up on the back of the couch with Artemis.  The 
others in the room all turned to Makoto as Usagi ran up to her.
	&#147;Mako-chan,&#148; said the blonde, &#147;how sick are you really?  It&#146;s 
worse than you told us, isn&#146;t it?&#148;
	Makoto put on a smile to try and hide the guilt she felt for 
lying to her friends and making the girl in front of her worry so 
much.  She reached up and tugged playfully on one of Usagi&#146;s 
ponytails.  &#147;I&#146;m not sick at all, Usagi.  I&#146;m as healthy as I&#146;ve 
ever been.&#148;
	Usagi looked confused by this answer.  But Minako beat her to 
the question.  &#147;Then what was wrong?  Because you were sick, Mako-
chan.  The meetings you missed, the soccer game, whatever else you 
and Ami have been hiding.  If it wasn&#146;t anemia then why tell us that 
instead of the truth?&#148;
	&#147;Because,&#148; began Makoto.  She hesitated and took a deep breath.  
&#147;Because I wasn&#146;t ready to tell you yet.  I just needed a little 
time.&#148;
	Usagi reached over and took Makoto&#146;s hand.  The gesture was 
done as much to reassure herself as it was for the other girl.
	Makoto forced a grin.  &#147;It&#146;s all right, Usagi.  I promise I&#146;m 
not dying.  It&#146;s just&#133;&#148;  Makoto shrugged, her grin faltering.  &#147;I&#146;m 
just pregnant.&#148;
