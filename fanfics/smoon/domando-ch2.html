<a href="../smoon/domando-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Makoto groaned as she awoke from her sleep. She slowly opened her eyes 
to see a worried Usagi sitting next to her.

&quot;Are you alright,&quot; Usagi asked.

&quot;Feel like I was rocked to sleep,&quot; Makoto said, rubbing her head. 
&quot;With a very large rock.&quot; She sat up. letting her eyes adjust to her 
surroundings. &quot;Where am I?&quot;

&quot;Your place. Yung Hu brought you here after he woke up,&quot; Usagi said. 
&quot;You wouldnt wake up...&quot;

Makoto looked at her. &quot;I wonder why...I wasn&#39;t even hit that 
hard...was I?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t think so,&quot; piped in a little voice. Makoto looked to the edge 
of her bed to finally notice Luna sitting there. &quot;But I want to know 
something, Makoto-san.&quot;

&quot;Uh..okay.&quot;

&quot;When did Ace give you your memory back?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t give her anything back,&quot; Ace said in defense, walking into 
the bedroom. &quot;She never lost it.&quot;

&quot;Nani??&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s right, I didn&#39;t. Morning after the battle with Beryl, I woke up 
with all of my memories.&quot;

&quot;Why,&quot; Usagi asked.

&quot;How,&quot; Luna asked at the same time.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. Ace didn&#39;t either. He kept quiet as I left that day. I 
thought the rest of the group had their memories back as well...&quot;

&quot;What made you realize we didn&#39;t,&quot; Usagi asked.

&quot;I went to talk to Minako a few days after I was well and she didn&#39;t 
remeber me,&quot; Makoto said, looking down at her blanket. &quot;I just kinna 
guessed none of the rest of you did either.&quot;

Usagi sighed and flung herself backwards onto Makoto&#39;s bed. 
&quot;Huh...wonder why you were so special?&quot;

Makoto shrugged, then blinked. &quot;What happened to Naru, Usagi?&quot;

&quot;Oh, she left after she woke up. Sailor Moon told her to leave and 
that Usagi had gone for help. So she bailed,&quot; Usagi said smiling. Then 
her smile faded. &quot;I hate lying to her.&quot;

&quot;Hai,&quot; Makoto nodded. 

Makoto kicked her blankets off, taking care to not hit Usagi in the 
head as she did so. &quot;What day is it?&quot;

&quot;Its saturday,&quot; Usagi said. &quot;You&#39;ve been out cold all night.&quot;

&quot;Better than all weekend,&quot; Makoto aid standing up and streching. She 
yawned and made a noise that reminded Usagi of Luna when she woke up 
from her cat naps. &quot;I&#39;m gonna take a shower.,&quot; she said. Makoto then 
smiled at Usagi. &quot;Afterwards, how about lunch? My treat?&quot;

Usagi smiled from ear to ear and nodded. &quot;Hai!&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Makoto was as good as her word for after taking her shower and getting 
dressed, she and Usagi (along with Luna and Ace who were tucked neatly 
inside their coats) went to sea food resturant for lunch. 

The place wasn&#39;t eaxactly fancy, but it was some what expensive. Usagi 
was a little worried about Makoto spending too much on her, but Makoto 
waved it off and smiled.

After ordering there food and getting their drinks, Makoto decided to 
start a conversation.

&quot;So, Usa-chan,&quot; she started. &quot;How ya been?&quot;

&quot;Oh I&#39;ve been alright. Schools goin about the same. But Iam happy to 
report that I *will* be graduating with my class in spring.&quot;

Makoto smiled. &quot;Thats great, Usagi. I&#39;m very proud of you. You going 
to college?&quot;

Usagi sipped her tea as she thought. &quot;I dunno yet. I want to, but I 
don&#39;t. Sides, I&#39;m not good in anything. What could I major in?&quot;

Makoto shrugged. &quot;I dont know. Perhaps you have a skill you&#39;re good at 
but you need to brush up on.&quot;

Usagi half smiled. &quot;Yea well, gaming isn&#39;t exactly a great career 
move, now is it?&quot;

Makoto chuckled. &quot;Iie, I suposse not.&quot;

Once their food arrived, they began to eat. To Makoto&#39;s surprise, 
Usagi didn&#39;t woof her food down. She ate like a normal human being 
instead of imtating a vacuum cleaner.

&quot;So, Mako-chan,&quot; Usagi said after taking abite of her shrimp. &quot;Do you 
still perform?&quot;

Makoto was slightly caught off by the question, but nodded. &quot;Hai, I 
do. I still perform wih Yuurichio&#39;s band.&quot;

Usagin blinked, and Luna popped her head out of Usagi&#39;s jacket and 
stole the piece of shrimp for herself. &quot;How?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Makoto said, taking anoher bite of her lobster. &quot;It seems that 
me and the band met a different way. I remeber it one way and they 
remeber it as another. They were holding audtions for a memeber and 
they saw me perform one night and asked me to join. But I remeber how 
it really happened.&quot;

Usagi nodded. &quot;Do you talk to Rei at all?&quot;

Makoto shook her head. &quot;Iie. I see her whenever I&#39;m over there, but 
we&#39;ve never spoken. Its kind of weird.&quot;

Usagi nodded again. &quot;You still write songs? Minako told me you did.&quot;

Makoto nodded. &quot;Hai, I do. Although my work is now alot more dark than 
it use to be.&quot;

&quot;Can I see any of it,&quot; Usagi asked, Luna playing the lil theif again.

&quot;Hai,&quot; Makoto said, slipping a piece of lobster tail down her coat for 
Ace to eat. &quot;You&#39;ll hafta wait till we get back to the loft tho, 
alright?&quot;

&quot;Ok,&quot; Usagi said smiling. 

&quot;Will this be all,&quot; The waitress asked looking at the two women siting 
at the table. 

Makoto nodded. &quot;Hai.&quot; The waitress smiled and handed Makoto the bill 
and left. Makoto removed her wallet and paid the tab, leaving a tip 
for the waitress.

------------------------------------------------------------

The girls went back to Makoto&#39;s loft, but decided to take a short walk 
in the cool afternoon air.

They walked in silence for the most part. Luna and Ace sitting on 
their respective owner&#39;s shoulders.

&quot;So...&quot;Makoto started, but had no idea what to say.

Usagi looked up at Makoto, then back to looking ahead. And with out 
thinking, she blurted out the question, &quot;Makoto, how long have you 
been gay?&quot;

Luna, Ace,and Makoto all three face faulted. &quot;*WHERE* did *THAT* come 
from,&quot; Makoto asked after picking herself up off the ground.

Usagi blinked. &quot;I&#39;unno. You dont have to answer. I&#39;m sorry I asked.&quot;

&quot;Oh, no its alright.&quot; She gave Makoto a reasuring smile tl et her know 
she was fine with the choice of topics. &quot;Um...I guess since I was real 
little. I mean, I&#39;ve never dated any guys, let alone sleep with one-&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re still a virgin!?&quot;

&quot;USAGI!&quot; Luna hissed. &quot;That is none of your business!&quot;

Makoto laughed. &quot;No, Luna. Its fine. I don&#39;t have a problem with it.&quot; 
Makoto then looked back to Usagi. &quot;Yes and no.&quot;

Usagi blinked. &quot;Nani??&quot;

Ace chuckled and rubbed his head aagainst Makoto&#39;s cheek, who then 
picked him up and laid him in his back in her arms and began to pet 
his stomache. 

&quot;I have had sex before, Usagi. So, in that sense, I&#39;m not a virgin. 
However, because I&#39;ve never had sex with a guy, pyshically, I *AM* a 
virgin. Get it?&quot;

Usagi blinked several times, a sweatdrop apearing over her head. 
&quot;I..think I do.&quot;

Makoto smiled. &quot;Good.&quot; Makoto then caught sight of a tall dark haired 
man who was standing across the street, talking to the owner of the 
video arcade.

&quot;Ne, Usagi, isn&#39;t that-?&quot;

&quot;MAMO-CHAN!&quot; Usagi squeled and took off across the street, nearly 
avoiding all the on coming traffic. Luna had jumped from Usagi&#39;s 
shoulder and was now perched on Makoto&#39;s as they watched the blonde 
literally throw herself at Mamoru.

Makoto smiled as she watched her prince and princess being reunited. 
But then her smile faded when she saw Usagi look up at Mamoru and her 
grip on his arm loosen. She then watched as Usagi dropped her head, 
bowed and walked back over to her and guardians.

&quot;Usagi? Usa, whats wrong,&quot; Makoto asked concerned.

&quot;He...he doesn&#39;t remeber,&quot; Usagi choked out over tears. &quot;He doesn&#39;t 
know who I am any more...&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Usagi sat with Makoto in a room in the loft Makoto called her studio. 
This was the largest room in Makoto&#39;s apartment, and this was where 
all of her art work was done. She had a few insterments in there as 
well, on the other side of the room so the music and art spaces were 
somewhat seperate.

Makoto rumaged thru a drawer while Usagi sat in her desk chair, pulled 
over close to Makoto&#39;s stool. Makoto found a cd she was looking for 
and closer the drawer and then placed the cd in her cd player. Pushing 
play, Makoto let Usagi hear her play the guitar notes that completed 
the song. Makoto explained she played all the insterments sepertely 
then combined them. She just needed to put the guitar in the mix.

The music was slow, but somewhat fast in some places. Makoto had been 
right. This song seemed darker than the ones she had heard her play at 
Rei&#39;s temple.

Makoto sat up a music sheet stand and placed the sheet music on it, 
which also had the lyrics on it.

Makoto then sat on the stool and picked up her guitar and, with her 
remote, replayed the song she was listening to. When the song started, 
Makoto began to sing and play.

&quot;Take me right now 
Up your arm, right next to your ear 
So I can whisper 
So what if now I forgive you 
So what if you&#39;re not the one 
I have to rise above you 
We must be moving on 

&quot;Take me down there 
Share your secrets 
Break the boundries into pieces 

&quot;Wake me up in time to miss you 
I won&#39;t know it and I won&#39;t care 
And so what if its blown to peices 
At least you&#39;re still alive 
&#39;Cause I just can&#39;t believe this 
You just laid down and died 

&quot;Take me down there 
Share your secrets 
Break the boundries into pieces 

&quot;Just say on the way down you&#39;ll wave to me 
Just say on the way down you&#39;ll wave to me 

&quot;Take me down there 
Share your secrets 
Break the boundries into pieces 

&quot;Just say that you&#39;ll break me right into pieces&quot;

The song ended with the last word of the lyrics, and Usagi sat there, 
dumstruck.

&quot;Are you depressed, Mako-chan?&quot;

Makoto smiled. &quot;I was when I write that song. I was all them yucky 
feelings I rarely see you experiance.&quot;

Usagi nodded. She couldn&#39;t argue with what Makoto said. She lived a 
pretty stress free life, except for her senshi duties.

Just then, Ace ran into the room, Artemis with him. 

&quot;Makoto! Usagi! Arty says there is a youma down town tearing 
everything up!&quot;

The two girls looked at one another, nodded and at the same time 
called out:

&quot;Moon crystal power, Make-up!&quot;

&quot;Jupiter power, Make-up!&quot;

In a bright flash of pink, white, and green, the senshis of Jupiter 
and the Moon replaced their alter egos.

They then took off out Makoto&#39;s balconey window with Ace, who was now 
in his Warrior form. 

Yung Hu soared above the girls, yelling down at them he was going 
ahead to slow the youma down. The girls ran as fast as they could to 
reach the site where the battle was being fought. 

They followed Yung Hu&#39;s light shadow as it soeared quickly over the 
ground. When it disappeared, they knew they were close.

Sailor Moon and Sailor Jupiter finally reached the fight, but saw Yung 
Hu wasn&#39;t fighting. Instead he stood there, dumbstruck, staring at the 
fight.

When the girls reached him, they saw why he wasn&#39;t fighting. 
Someone..or rather something was already. </pre>
