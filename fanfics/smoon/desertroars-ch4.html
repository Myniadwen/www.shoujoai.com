<h1>And the Desert Roars (part 4 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/arashi.html">arashi-enkou</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/desertroars-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Usagi paced in front of her bed, worry eating her common sense like a 
slow poison. &quot;What happened to her Rei?&quot; she whimpered to the silent 
soldier at the window. Rei glared at something in the night, her lips 
forming a tight line. &quot;I do not know princess.&quot;

Usagi hiccuped a sob and slumped to the bed. What had happened to 
Setsuna? She was kidnapped, that much they knew. But by who?

Dear gods above she was sick with dark thoughts of blood and chains.

Rei was also filled with dark thoughts, but for a completely different 
reason. The black haired girl hadn&#39;t known Setsuna all that long, 
perhaps only one summer, and she wasn&#39;t all that comfortable with the 
sorceress. But Usagi loved the green haired woman like a second mother. 
That was enough for Rei.

She grimaced as slight twinges of pain nicked at her brain. Cursing 
under her creath, Rei pressed the heel of her palm to her forhead, 
trying to calm the swell of dark magic inside that corner of her mind. 
Tales were whispered about a deadly ritual that thrived amongst those 
who lived in the desert. It was said that when the child was old enough, 
it was given to the tribal priest. The priest would then foretell the 
child&#39;s destiny, and , depending on the path the child would walk, carve 
ancient words of a long dead language into their skin. Envoking the dark 
arts and calling a demonic spirit from the dead to inhabit the child&#39;s 
flesh and soul.

The ritual was extremely painful and most didn&#39;t survive. The ones that 
were lucky enough to physically survive it were often killed because of 
the power if the demonic force eroding their soul. There were a few 
individuals that survived the ritual and the demon. They were highly 
praised and congratulated.

Rei was one of those children.

The desert child bit back a whimper as she willed the demon away, 
creating mental walls and chains to barracade the demon from her body.

&quot;Rei?&quot; The sound of her name broke her out of her trance.

Rei turned and whisked a trembling Usagi into her arms. &quot;We&#39;ll find 
her,&quot; she whispered into the sobbing girl&#39;s ear. &quot;This I swear to you, 
love.&quot;

&quot;How touching.&quot;

Rei and Usagi both snapped their heads to see--

&quot;Oh no!&quot; Usagi wailed.

------- 10,000 years later; Present Day Egypt ------

Professer Ami Mizuno wiped the sweat from her forehead with the blue 
kercheif. The blue haired teacher sighed in pleasure as she turned to 
regard the stone tablet she had discovered.

&quot;Now, let&#39;s see what stories you have to tell.&quot; she murmured. Brushing 
away the dust and sand, she read the message that was written there.

&quot;Beware, oh t--&quot; she squinted at the message, trying to translate it. 
&quot;Traveler, for thou shall find the tomb of the two lovers.&quot; Ami blinked 
as her heart ached in sympathy. She fixed her glasses and began to read 
again. &quot;Unseal the cursed one from her cage and face the--&quot; Ami 
swallowed. &quot;The Wrath of Anubus. If thoust unseal the Cursed one, unseal 
the Pure one and the One of Magicks and--&quot; The rest was far too faded to 
decipher.

Blinking at the cryptic words, Ami searched the wall for a push in brick 
of some sort. &#39;&quot;The Cursed one&quot;? &quot;Wrath of Anubus&quot;? This certaintly 
wasn&#39;t mentioned in the textbooks.&#39;

She let out a small gasp as the stones began to sink, revealing a secret 
passageway. &#39;Astounding!&#39;

Ami walked into the chamber and coughed at the musty air. This looked 
like the royal chamber of the princess, though while the walls were 
covered in beautiful ornaments, the floor was completely bare. Ami 
clicked on her flashlight and began to gaze at the strange carvings that 
had been carved into the walls. The symbols were strange, the words 
written in a language that was completely forgien to the blue haired 
genius. Turning in a complete circle, Ami shined her flashlight onto the 
ceiling. What she saw there made her gasp.

A black sarcoghagus had been chained there, the thick links covered in 
the same runes as the walls. Even more strange was that the sarcoghagus 
was smaller than that of the pharoh&#39;s, and it was certainly wasn&#39;t as 
ornate. It was covered in the strange markings as the chains and the 
walls.

&#39;The Cursed One.&#39;

The thought made Ami blink. Though as she continued to admire the 
craftmanship of the egyptian coffin, a chill began to invade her body. 
Which was completely obsurd. The chamber was as hot as the desert.

Ami removed her flashlight and her gaze from the ceiling and began to 
search agian. A shine of gold caught her eye and she quickly shined her 
artificial light to the corner.

There, covered in dirt and grime, was a solid gold lamp.

Ami walked toward it and carfully lifted the remarkably light object. 
Taking out her blue kerchief, she began to scrub feriousciously at the 
caked mud.

&quot;There&#39;s some kind of writing on here...&quot; she murmured to herself, not 
noticing how the lamp began to warm in her hands.

Then, everything happened at once.

Ami gasped in pain as the lamp grew white hot in her hands. She nearly 
dropped it but the lamp cooled off as quickly as it had warmed. A green 
smoke began to drift out of the mouth of the lamp, swiriling until it 
encompased the entire chamber. The blue haired woman held her breath 
incase the smoke was poisoness. The green smoke hang in the air, then 
began to contract in on itself. The cloud became smaller and smaller, 
before it began to form a human shape.

Seconds passed.

The smoke cleared and Ami released her breath in a rush. Standing in the 
middle of the room, was a woman, clad in silk and jewels, her long brown 
hair tied with a ribbon at the top of her head.

The woman yawned and stretched, barinf her midriff and showing off 
well-toned abbs.

Ami was dumbfounded.

&quot;Boy, oh boy Rei.&quot; The woman sneered up at the coffin. &quot;You sure did it 
this time.&quot; To make Ami fear her sanity, the woman floated to the 
ceiling and the chained sarcoghagus. She then turned upside down and 
walked on the ceiling.

The brunette whistled low. &quot;Damn,&quot; she murmured. &quot;Anubus was pissed at 
you eh? Pissed enough to reject you from the Underworld.&quot; Emerald green 
eyes scanned the runes on the coffin and the chains.

&quot;And you&#39;re cursed too?&quot; the woman laughed. &quot;Gods above, what the bloody 
hell did you do?&quot; It was then that she noticed the trembling form of 
Ami.

With a pop, the woman vanished and reapeared in front of Ami. &quot;Well well 
well,&quot; she purred. &quot;Haven&#39;t had a woman wake me up in forever.&quot;

&quot;W-wake y-you?&quot; Ami squeaked. The warning to not wake the &quot;Cursed one&quot; 
ran into her mind. &quot;Oh no!&quot; she wailed. &quot;I&#39;ve doomed the human race! 
I&#39;ve unleashed the Wrath of Anubus!! I&#39;ve created another Apocolaypse!!&quot; 
She wailed again and began to thump her head against the wall. &quot;Stupid 
stupid stupid Ami!&quot; she growled.

&quot;You just had to rub the freakin lamp! What were thinking!? Oh wait, I 
know! &#39;La la la, oh look! A big door that says STAY OUT!!! I think I 
might go in!&quot; The teacher said in a highpitched mocking voice. &quot;&#39;Lookie 
lookie, a lamp!! Why don&#39;t I rub it and see if I can destroy the 
world!!!&#39;&quot; She hit her head with a fist. &quot;What the hell did you think 
would come out!?!? A Genie!?&quot;

&quot;Actually,&quot; the now confused brunette droned. &quot;That would be true.&quot;

Makoto had no idea how long it had been since she was released from the 
lamp. Before, she had been apart of the desert people, just like her 
sister Rei had been. But then she was sold to traders and cursed to the 
life of a dijjin, a genie. She lifted her wrists and glared at the solid 
gold bands.

&#39;Bands? More like shackles.&#39;

&quot;Wh-what?&quot;

She turned to face her new master. The woman was slim, petite. Her hair 
curled slitghtly at the base of her neck and it was an interesting shade 
of...

&#39;Blue? That&#39;s odd.&#39;

Navy blude eyes widened and tears began to pool at the corners. &quot;Hey,&quot; 
Makoto gasped, panic showing as she rushed to the blue haired girl. &quot;No 
crying!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m s-sorry!&quot; The woman hiccuped. Makoto groaned and held her head. 
&quot;Oh, God I&#39;m losing my mind!!&quot; Her master wailed. Makoto raised one 
elegant brow.

&quot;You&#39;re not insane.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve doomed the human race!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve done no such thing.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve brought the next Apocolypse! I&#39;ve unleashed the Wrath of Anubus!&quot;

&quot;Unless you opened that coffin up there, you haven&#39;t brought the next 
Apocolyapse.&quot;

Sniffle. &quot;I haven&#39;t?&quot;

Makoto sighed. &quot;Nope.&quot;

Silence encompased the two of them. &quot;Are you a genie?&quot; the girl asked.

Makoto grinned. &quot;Yep.&quot; Her master&#39;s eyes bugged. &quot;As in, &#39;I shall grant 
you three wishes&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah. And before we get on with the rules and regulations bit, I 
need two things from you. First: your name.&quot;

&quot;A-Ami Mizuno.&quot;

Makoto nodded. &quot;Pretty name.&quot; Ami blushed.

&quot;And second,&quot; In a flash, Makoto had Ami pressed up against the wall, 
her much taller body looming over Ami&#39;s. Ami gasped as Makoto leaned 
down.

&quot;I need a kiss.&quot;</pre>
