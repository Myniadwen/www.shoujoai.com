<h1>Inner Crisis, Outer Conflict (part 9 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/innerouter-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Startled, Titania stopped her attack. She turned towards the direction 
of the voice and found herself looking at five more Senshi. Sailor 
Moon stepped forward and pointed at Titania. 

&quot;If you destroy our friends, you will still have lost. You can&#39;t win 
this fight.&quot; 

&quot;Then maybe I can destroy their precious Princess!!&quot; Titania hurled a 
tremendous blast at Sailor Moon. In return each of the Senshi threw a 
potent attack towards Titania. 

&quot;Sparkling Oak Evolution!&quot; 

&quot;Mars Flame Sniper!&quot; 

&quot;Aqua Rhapsody!&quot;

&quot;Love and Beauty Shock!&quot; 

Titania fell back, coughing and choking. &quot;I may never win this battle, 
or the war, but I can take love from all of you. The way it was taken 
from me.&quot; 

Uranus ran over to the fallen Sailor Moon. 

Sailor Moon laid her head back, smiling. &quot;I told you, Titania, you 
cannot win.&quot; And smiling, she rose into the air, transforming to 
Princess Serenity. &quot;Only love wins, Titania.&quot; Serenity held her 
crystal before her and blasted Titania with the power of the Silver 
Millenium. Titania screamed and burst into flame. 

&quot;No!!!&quot; A voice came from the side and a figure ran towards the 
burning body. Uranus ran to intercept it, stopping Oberon from hurling 
himself into the flame. 

Serenity stood before Uranus and touched her arm. &quot;Let him go.&quot; 

Oberon ran to the burning figure. &quot;No, Titania, don&#39;t let hate win. I 
still love you.&quot; The flames began to die. Oberon collapsed, sobbing. 
The flames disappeared. A body fell to the ground. Oberon looked in 
astonishment, as Titania sat up and looked at him, smiling. 

&quot;Oberon, why do you cry?&quot; She reached out to catch a tear on her 
finger. He held her hand to his face. Titania looked up to see the 
Senshi gathered around her. She frowned in puzzlement. &quot;I feel 
strange. Did I faint?&quot; Oberon sobbed again. 

Sailor Moon stood over Titania, &quot;You have been reborn by love.&quot; She 
paused. &quot;It&#39;ll feel a little funny for a while, but you&#39;ll be okay!&quot; 

The Senshi all choked. 

Uranus and Neptune, leaning on each other, addressed their Princess. 

&quot;How did you know?&quot; 

&quot;Sailor Mercury figured it out, actually!&quot; 

Mercury blushed. 

Uranus stared at Sailor Moon grimly. &quot;This was my fight. Thank you for 
your help, but...&quot; 

Sailors Mars and Jupiter both stepped forward, but Sailor Moon held 
them back. 

&quot;You&#39;re wrong too Uranus. There won&#39;t ever again be a fight for one of 
us alone. Or two or three.&quot; She looked meaningfully at Neptune and 
Pluto. &quot;From now on it&#39;s all or nothing. That&#39;s going to be the first 
rule of Crystal Tokyo. None of us will be isolated anymore.&quot; Her face 
was determined. 

Uranus closed her eyes, then smiled and opened them again. &quot;Thank you, 
Sailor Moon.&quot; Looking around she said, &quot;Thank you all.&quot; 

&quot;Let&#39;s go home.&quot; said Sailor Moon.

Epilogue

&quot;Michiru...&quot; Haruka began, but Michiru put her finger on Haruka&#39;s 
lips. It was evening and the lights of Tokyo flooded into their room. 
They had just made love and were laying, legs and arms intertwined, in 
their bed. 

&quot;I almost killed you.&quot; Haruka removed the finger gently. 

Michiru laid her head against her lover&#39;s chest, hearing her 
heartbeat, calm and slow. She sighed. 

&quot;What you did, you did because a thousand years ago, you did what you 
had to do. If you hadn&#39;t done it, the old Neptune would be waiting 
there still. It&#39;s a new age. A new Millenium. Let&#39;s move into it 
gladly.&quot; 

Haruka kissed Michiru&#39;s head. Michiru looked up and laughed that 
laugh... 

And in the Crystal Palace of the Silver Millenium, Neptune and Uranus 
danced until the sun rose.</pre>
