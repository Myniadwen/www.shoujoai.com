(Call my name)

Rei&#39;s POV

Hino Rei...I am the reincarnate of sailor mars, protector and loyal 
friend to princess Serenity. However that surface is a lie; I am nothing 
but a cheap replacement for a dead soldier who was more than I&#39;ll ever 
be and who will soon return. Her memories are returning. I&#39;m 
changing...disappearing slowly, losing myself. Sincerely it frightens 
me. Hino Rei...That is who I am and who I am not.

I closed my eyes, falling backwards into the nothingness. The wind beat 
my back and threw my hair upwards, gravity pulled a few of my raven 
strands back onto my face. I waited and then it came. The sound of a 
bell pinged gently. Ping.

When I had opened my eyes I was in a grove, standing amidst isles of 
sakura trees in full bloom with my miko outfit on. No words could have 
described the strangeness of familiarity that the topography provided so 
I said nothing.

Flashback
Mina and I were sitting outside of the school, eating our lunch at a 
small picnic table. A bug had fell from the tree above us into my 
sandwich. When I was about to let loose the swears Mina slapped her hand 
over my mouth and lectured me.

&quot;Curses are a waste of breath, all you&#39;ll do is exhaust yourself.&quot;

She was grinning. With her other hand she wagged her index finger in 
front of my glaring expression. She&#39;d better watch it, unlike her I can 
bite if aggravated. Her air of superiority didn&#39;t last long though; the 
bug in my sandwich became bored of mine and flew into hers. She went 
into a rant in her native language, English. I wonder where she learned 
all those &#39;interesting&#39; words.

Flashback end

The memory brought a smirk to my face, she had always been there to 
cheer me up... even if she was a little hypocrite.

A flurry of soft, rose colored pedals fell into my face and through my 
hair. The sensation was enough to smack my mind a reality check. Slowly 
I took deep breaths and opened my eyes, refocusing to the task at hand. 
My feet took tiny baby steps on the spot, flirting with directing while 
I pondered the path to tread.

After a moment my mouth curled downwards into a thoughtful frown. It all 
looked the same to me.

Finally I moved to the right. The lush, green grass bent under my foot&#39;s 
power without a fight and I felt somehow disappointed. Perhaps it was 
from my counter ego&#39;s nature that was rising to the surface again. 
Sailor Mars was the goddess of war and passion after all.

Carefully I made to take another advance forward only to stop upon 
hearing someone giggling.

&quot;Aww, you don&#39;t say Rei chan.&quot;

My stomach did a flip-flop at the voice. It sounded like Mina but 
where...? I was over here but I don&#39;t see her anywhere. A wind blew up 
and instinctively my arms rose to shield myself. Sakura pedals danced 
all round my defensive form, the wind lead them around with an invisible 
leash. When I had opened my eyes there was a small but noticeable path 
carved in the overgrown grass.

So this was where I was supposed to go, to go where I am told I&#39;m no 
better than those chained tied petals am I? It seemed fate had similar 
binds to me...My eyes stung from the on coming salty tears...even here, 
away from my own world I could not choose my own path...

I choked down a sob, brushing away the signs of weakness with my hands. 
Soon anger replaced the depression and a whimper transformed into a 
defiant growl. Stubbornly I tried to move opposite to the path&#39;s 
direction only to be blown backwards by a sharp, cold breeze. It felt 
like dozens of knives impaling themselves into my soft flesh. Following 
the motion of the wind, the atmosphere around my position dropped 
temperature to the point where I was shivering.

&quot;Fine! I guess I have no choice right!&quot; I yelled to no one. Like anyone 
would listen anyway.

Treading down the path with fists clenched I warily became conscious of 
voices that grew louder. So what if there were people here? Why should 
it concer-

&quot;Mina chan...&quot;

There was me...

&quot;Mina chan?&quot; I felt myself whisper softly, repeating my own reflection&#39;s 
words. The two figures hadn&#39;t taken notice of my presence.

&quot;Hai, Rei chan?&quot;

It felt odd to be seeing Mina and myself like this, it felt like us but 
at the same time it wasn&#39;t. Could it be our past selves? Taking in all 
the details the two scouts were all dressed in their fukus.

&quot;I...ah, w-wanted to talk about something.&quot; Mars stammered to the golden 
haired goddess that stood before her. There were both underneath a large 
sakura tree. It was the biggest tree in the grove and I had to admit, it 
was bigger than any other sakura that I&#39;ve ever seen. However one thing 
puzzled me, what were they doing here? Aren&#39;t they supposed to be 
protecting the queen?

&quot;Rei chan, you know we have to get back soon! Our mission-&quot;

&quot;Hai, hai, Mina chan. I haven&#39;t forgotten the mission.&quot;

She gave mars a slightly puzzled look but continued to smile. That smile 
looked veeeeeery familiar, Mina used it a lot when she scoped out...My 
eyes widened. No, you don&#39;t mean...

&quot;Well...?&quot;

Holy shit, she&#39;s blushing! I felt myself shift uncomfortably on the 
spot. I wonder how mars would take this. Looking back to my counterpart 
I was met with an equally shocking surprise. Mars was too busy blushing 
as well to really notice Mina&#39;s! My jaw dropped slightly. Some great 
warriors acting like a pair of adolescent teens. It certainly wasn&#39;t 
what I had expected...

&quot;I&#39;ve been meaning...well you know...to ask you...no! To tell 
you...a-about...&quot; She stopped and bit her lip, refusing to look up into 
the goddess of love&#39;s cerulean orbs.

Mina was leaning against the main body of the tree, watching mars 
stutter with an amused but knowing expression. She giggled softly, 
looking down for a moment as well. After a minute venus pushed herself 
off the tree with both of her hands and stood up.

In one smooth motion she held out her right hand towards the blushing 
Mars. The whole thing was boggling my mind, what was she up to?

Mars stared at it hesitantly; there was an uncertain look residing in 
her eyes. Eyeing the hand cautiously, she slowly lifted her right hand 
towards Venus&#39;s to take hold of the gloved hand. I guess she finally 
made up her mind.

Mar&#39;s hand almost reached Venus&#39;s when the goddess of love grew 
impatient. There was a squeal as the golden haired girl grabbed Mar&#39;s 
hand and threw her against the tree&#39;s bark. The two of them were very 
close, faces inches apart.

&quot;Mina...chan...&quot;

My mind was having a brain freeze. Too much was happening, I couldn&#39;t 
believe this.

&quot;Shhh...&quot;

Both blushing profusely, they both leaned in and met with a soft kiss. 
Venus decided to press their lips together harder and deepened the kiss 
while her hands roamed around her companion&#39;s curved form.

&quot;Mmm...&quot; Mar&#39;s gasped slightly when Venus&#39;s hands moved south. &quot;Min-&quot; 
She started but was silenced when Venus slipped her tongue into Mar&#39;s 
mouth. The senshi of fire returned the favor immediately.

I could feel my face turn deepen through various shades of red as they 
pair became more intimate. Their bodies were pressed tight together and 
the moans grew louder by the second. They allowed themselves to be 
swallowed by passion and lust. You could almost feel the heat radiating 
from their perspiring bodies from where I stood.

I was staring. For the entire time while I watched this it hadn&#39;t really 
hit me. Realization came hard, Mina and me...they were us and they 
were...

&quot;NOOOOO!&quot; A high pitched scream emerged from my lips as my hands tensed 
around strands of my hair. My eyes shut themselves tight to expel the 
image from my mind.

The scenery exploded and dissipated in the form of the sakura petals. 
Everything was dark, a dark void of space which I stood. My knees shook 
at the images flashed through my mind.

&quot;No...no...&quot;

It couldn&#39;t be but it was...I couldn&#39;t deny it any longer, it was 
another memory.

I knew there was something odd about the way I felt about my best 
friend. How I wanted her, how she made me feel like the happiest person 
in this world when she was by my side. I adored everything about Mina, 
the way her bright blue eyes would look at me, the warmth of her 
touch...she was perfect, everything I&#39;d ever want in a person.

But Mars and Venus, they were lovers in the past. Does this mean my 
feelings for Mina aren&#39;t really mine but Mar&#39;s? Oh Kami! Please don&#39;t 
let it be...

&quot;How...can past feelings affect me now?&quot; I whispered desperately.

It was all an illusion. It&#39;s not my reality. It never happened to me!

&quot;Rei chan?&quot; Mina&#39;s voice echoed through the darkness.

&quot;Ahh!&quot; I screamed, grabbing my head again. My body was trembled and 
twitched slightly.

Memories came rushing back. We were by the tree outside school, Mina 
came to meet me, we were talking and she took my hand...and...and...All 
the images flashed through quickly, then repeating itself in a cycle.

My body swayed side to side, shaking my head as I tried to remember. 
Pain...

&quot;Gah!&quot;

My knees buckled, a loud thud was heard as there was a contact with the 
surface beneath me. My eyes shot open surprise. It became harder to 
breathe, my sides tightened together, crushing the air out of me. What 
was happening to me?

&quot;Ha...ha...neh!&quot; My face winced as I struggled for breath.

Everything whirled before my eyes, similar to before. No longer able to 
hold myself up I fell flat on a hard pitch-black surface, sweat dripped 
down my fevered brow. This was my reality. This is what life was, pain 
and hardship. Before I could stop myself I half whimpered,

&quot;Mina...chan...it hurts.&quot;

Somewhere inside my heart cried out for her, but she wasn&#39;t here, I was 
alone. Silence followed my voice.

Without warning I felt a pair of invisible arms wrapped themselves 
around me. The aura was familiar. It was Mina&#39;s. I couldn&#39;t see her, but 
she was here...she was here. Domo arigato Kami! I tried not to cry when 
I felt those comforting arms or when the warmth of her body pressed 
itself against my side. I really tried.

I rolled in the presence&#39;s grip, pushing myself against Mina&#39;s warmth. 
The weight on my chest lifted and I could breath again. I don&#39;t know how 
long we were like that but it felt like an eternity.

To my disappointment I felt the arms leave after the eternity. A fear 
rushed me, what if I was going to be left here alone again?

&quot;Mina!&quot; I cried out.

&#39;Open your eyes.&#39;

When I came to my eyes squinted from the sudden brightness of light. 
Soft fabric embraced my weary form and a damp towel lay folded neatly on 
my forehead. I sat up, curious as to where I was now.

&quot;Oh, you awake Rei?&quot;

My head turned towards the voice. Mina popped her head around the 
corner. I noticed her face seemed to light up upon seeing me, or was it 
my imagination?

&quot;Hai...&quot; I weakly replied.

My attention was drawn to how little she was wearing. Mini shorts and a 
tight short sleeve! This can&#39;t be good.

&quot;Stop...&quot; I muttered very quietly under my breath, willing myself to 
stop staring at the beautiful creature in front of me. I hope she hasn&#39;t 
noticed...

&quot;Well, now that you&#39;re awake, do you need anything? Water? Maybe 
something to eat?&quot;

&quot;Huh? Uhh...&quot;

She laughed.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m not that bad of a cook!&quot;

&quot;Ah, ile, its not that!&quot; I waved my arms trying to convince her.

&quot;Oh really?&quot;

There was that look again. Suddenly my toes under the covers started to 
look very interesting.

&quot;We should get started on that project actually...&quot; I finally replied.

Mina frowned and shook her head.

&quot;I don&#39;t know Rei chan, you were really out of it and you&#39;re still sick! 
Don&#39;t tell me you want to exhaust yourself all over again?&quot;

&quot;W-well...I really am feeling better! Please, I mean, it won&#39;t take long 
and I actually have an idea.&quot; School work always took my mind off my 
problems.

&quot;You do?&quot;

I motioned the blond to take a seat on the bed next to me. She eagerly 
sat down, almost skipped over in fact.

&quot;What do you think about doing a song?&quot;

&quot;Hmm...&quot; She brought her hands up to her chin in mock consideration. &quot;I 
like it!&quot;

When she leaned in towards me, I found myself hit by the images in the 
sakura grove.

&quot;U-uh, yeah...&quot;

In an attempt to hide my blush I brought my hand up to my mouth and 
coughed gently. It didn&#39;t help that Mina decided to wear such a skimpy 
outfit of all days! When you&#39;re sick you have way less control over what 
your body.

&quot;Got any idea on a theme Rei chan? It was your idea after all.&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you choose.&quot;

&quot;Okay, how about love?&quot;

There was a silence.

&quot;L-love?&quot; I almost squeaked. It was last topic I wanted to discuss in 
the world right now. Take deep breathes Rei, I coaxed myself. &quot;Sure Mina 
chan.&quot; Why can&#39;t I say no?

&quot;Great! So maybe we should...&quot;

I only caught bits and pieces of what she was saying. My eyes were too 
interested in watching the goddess of love&#39;s movements. The cute 
expressions on her face, the way she can get excited by the little 
things, the way her lips moved...their rosy color, Kami, they looked so 
soft. I started to feel envious of Mars, the way she kissed Venus and 
how Venus loved her back. My mind replayed the scene step by step before 
my very eyes.

&quot;Mina chan...&quot;

&quot;Hai, Rei chan?&quot;

Her entire attention was on me now. Despite feeling nervous I just had 
to ask.

&quot;What...do you think about love?&quot;

&quot;Why are you asking?&quot;

&quot;You are the goddess of love and we are doing a love song...&quot; I chose my 
words carefully. &quot;It would help if I knew your opinion on the topic.&quot;

&quot;Oh...&quot; She fell silent and considered the question for awhile. &quot;Well 
Rei chan...Do you believe in soul mates?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; I blinked. &quot;Well I don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;I believe in the idea.&quot; She giggled. &quot;Rei chan. let me ask you 
something. You know the feeling you get when you lose something or 
someone precious to you? How you feel like a part of you has died or 
disappeared?&quot;

I nodded my head slowly.

&quot; It&#39;s because that&#39;s exactly it. You did lose a piece of yourself.&quot;

Losing my mom and dealing with my father had made me feel exactly that. 
What she was getting at sounded interesting, all my attention was on her 
every word now.

&quot;You see Rei chan, all human&#39;s soul are jagged.&quot; She sighed. 
&quot;Incomplete...Our souls are constantly being torn to pieces and in turn, 
are continually being rebuilt with a type of glue, weak or strong, it 
depends on the individuals will.&quot;

&quot;Honto?&quot;

&quot;Hai. When we experience great lose and other people try to help us out, 
our souls slowly try to replace what was initially lost. It&#39;s because of 
the people who are willing to take time to be there for you. When they 
choose to become a part of your life they become a part of you. Follow 
me so far?&quot;

My only reply was a quick nod of my head.

&quot;A soul exchange happens.&quot; Mina whispers softly. &quot;You can think of it as 
a partial transplant, they give you a piece of their soul for your 
own...that piece will be special Rei chan...it&#39;ll be different from all 
the others and will grow with the relationship between the person who 
gave it to you and yourself.&quot;

&quot;But...what happens to the lost pieces?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s coming up, stop being impatient.&quot; She stuck out her tongue. 
&quot;Ahh...Let&#39;s see...Well, you know how we say a soul mate is our missing 
half?&quot; I nodded my head once more. &quot;That&#39;s the way it is, exactly how it 
is. Going through life all people dream of finding that one special 
person just for them. We endure the hardships and lose pieces of our 
soul in hope that someday we&#39;ll find that person. So many people...and 
so many souls...we search for our missing selves in this vast world. Do 
you see the problem Rei chan?&quot;

&quot;Finding...your soul mate?&quot; I guessed.

&quot;Bingo. Very good Rei chan.&quot; She struck her sailor V pose for victory. 
&quot;People often mistake their lost pieces for something similar. That&#39;s 
why some people lust and not love, only falsely convincing themselves 
something its not. The result is always a feeling of emptiness...when 
two impatient souls try to jam the two halves of the puzzle together 
they will only hurt themselves in the end...&quot;

I swallowed hard. It made so much sense to me...Do I really love Mina? 
Or is it just lust? It sounded so horrible! I sure wouldn&#39;t want to rush 
things and risk losing someone special forever.

&quot;But Rai chan...&quot; Mina&#39;s voice was softly whispering into my ear, her 
breath tickled it and sent shivers down my back. &quot;When you do meet that 
special person...you&#39;ll know for sure...because... there&#39;s only one 
special feeling that you&#39;ll ever feel, only for them.&quot;

&quot;M-mina chan...?&quot;

&quot;Minako! Help me carry the groceries to the kitchen!&quot; Came a shrilly 
voice.

The mood of the moment was broken and the front door could be heard 
opening with the following of footsteps. Mina&#39;s mother had come back. 
Mina pulled herself away from me and turned to go help her mother.

&quot;Mina chan?&quot;

&quot;Hai, Rei chan?&quot;:

&quot;You really are the goddess of love.&quot; I felt myself smirk.

With that she gave a small bow, then whirled around and bolted from the 
room. She surprises me sometimes. That false ditsy blond act...She 
always seems klutzy and dense but it&#39;s only a fa&ccedil;ade. It took me a few 
months to catch on after I first met her. Ami seems to suspect it and so 
did Makoto. However Usagi is probably the only one who hasn&#39;t the 
slightest clue! I felt myself sigh, Usagi is naturally dense.

&quot;Rei, since your awake do ya mind helping?&quot; Mina called from the 
kitchen.

&quot;Be there in a sec!&quot; I was already jumping out of the bed.

Mina is who she is...I don&#39;t think I could ever understand all of 
her...but in moments like those... you really catch a glimpse of the 
real Aino Minako underneath it all.
