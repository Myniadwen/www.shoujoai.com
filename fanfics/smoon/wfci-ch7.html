<h1>Wild Fire, Crystal Ice (part 7 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/wfci-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>&#147;What will we do now, Setsuna-mama? They love each other, we can&#146;t 
separate them&#133;&#148;

&#147;But Hotaru-san, Rei and her friends are thieves, criminals&#133;they&#146;re 
kidnappers. Don&#146;t you want Serenity to be safe?&#148;

&#147;Her name is Usagi, Haruka-san, and it doesn&#146;t matter! They haven&#146;t done 
anything bad in years! And Usagi will be sad if we take her away from 
her Rei-koi...&#148;

&#147;Rei-koi?&#148;

&#147;Yes, Michiru-chan, Rei-koi! Usagi is Rei&#146;s koibito, and vice versa! We 
HAVE to keep them together!&#148;

&#147;Well&#133;Ruka, the girl does have a point&#133;&#148;

&#147;D-demo Michi-chan!!&#148;

&#147;&#133;No more. Hotaru, it&#146;d be best if we brought Serenity home. Haruka and 
Michiru&#133;we have no choice.&#148;

&#147;Demo Setsuna-mama! They LOVE each other! Onegai, don&#146;t take Usagi 
back!&#148;

&#147;Hush Hotaru. No more. Love is insignificant in this situation. We will 
all be arrested if we are withholding information.&#148;

&#147;Setsuna-mama! Love is never&#151;&#148;

&#147;Hotaru...onegai...silence. And&#133;gomen nasai, Firefly&#133;.&#148;

==================

The rain had gone from a steady drizzle to a real storm. Serenity gasped 
each time she heard a thunderclap, or when the sky was illuminated with 
a streak of lightning. Rei laughed and grasped onto Serenity&#146;s hand, 
tugging her along. &#147;Scared of lightning, Usagi-chan?&#148; Serenity yelped 
when she heard the boom of thunder again. &#147;Hai&#133;Rei&#133;Rei-chan&#133;onegai&#133;let&#146;s 
hurry,&#148; she murmured, nuzzling the red-head&#146;s shoulder. Rei smiled 
softly. &#147;Don&#146;t worry&#133;we&#146;ll be there in no time..&#148;  She stopped for a 
moment to brush the wet, silvery strands of hair from Serenity&#146;s face. 
Serenity stared at Rei and smiled weakly, trying to hide her fear of the 
storm. &#147;Rei-chan...you&#146;re so pretty...much better than the storm.&#148; Rei 
smirked, and leaned closer to Serenity for another kiss. Another clap of 
thunder made Serenity yelp and jump, and she knocked heads with Rei. 
&#147;Owww&#133;Usagi-chan...you have a hard head!&#148; Serenity frowned, rubbing her 
forehead, and standing up to kiss Rei&#146;s forehead. Another clap of 
thunder startled the silver-haired girl, and she squealed, clinging on 
to Rei. The red-haired girl grinned rakishly. &#147;Maybe there should be 
thunderstorms more often, ne?&#148;

&#147;Hentai Rei-chan!&#148;

===================

&#147;Ma&#146;am&#133;you don&#146;t understand. Harboring fugitives is a felony!&#148; Naomi 
Naide glared at the young man, causing him to look down. &#147;My. Daughter. 
Is. No. Fugitive. Is that understood?&#148; The young man glanced back at 
her. &#147;But&#133;ma&#146;am..we have to arrest them. They ARE fugitives,&#148; his voice 
hardened, &#147;and we have a search warrant.&#148; Naomi&#146;s eyebrows rose. &#147;We?&#148; 
The bushes rustled, and Naomi&#146;s blue-gray eyes narrowed. What&#146;s&#151;&#148; Before 
she could finish her sentence, other officers had swarmed the front 
gardens.

Naomi uttered a very rare curse&#133;

===================

&#147;Didja hear that?&#148; Minako asked the others. &#147;Makoto growled. &#147;Yeah.&#148; Ami 
and Mitsuki peeked out of the window.

&#147;Oh my..&#148; Ami said.

&#147;Oh no..&#148; Mitsuki muttered.

&#147;We gotta get out of here..&#148; Minako said quietly.

Mitsuki perked up and grinned. &#147;Hey&#133;we can escape. I know where to go!&#148;

Mitsuki hopped up, and the others followed after her&#133;

===================

&#147;Rei-chan,&#148; Serenity said, staring up at the sky, &#147;the rain&#133;it stopped! 
Yay!&#148; She grabbed her newfound love and spun her around. Rei laughed, 
and pulled her into a kiss, holding her tightly. &#147;Usagi-chan&#133;the sky is 
still gray. Let&#146;s hurry up, before it starts again, ok?&#148; Serenity 
giggled. &#147;You just rhymed, Rei-chan..&#148; Rei laughed again. &#147;Well, I guess 
I did. But come on. We have to go get the girls.&#148; Serenity nodded. &#147;Hai! 
Hmm...I wonder if Mitsuki&#146;s mother is being nice&#133;&#148; Rei smiled. &#147;I bet 
she is, after that talking to you gave her.&#148; Serenity shivered, feeling 
a blast of cold wind run past her. &#147;We should go..it&#146;s getting cold.&#148; 
Rei nodded, and put her jacket around Serenity&#146;s shoulders. &#147;Can&#146;t have 
you catching a cold&#133;&#148; She turned as she heard a car pull up. &#147;What the 
hell? Who&#146;s that?&#148; Serenity turned in the direction Rei was staring and 
gasped. &#147;That&#146;s&#133;that&#146;s Daddy&#146;s car&#133;&#148;  Rei gawked at her. &#147;What?!&#148; She 
watched as the car stopped near the street outside the park, and a tall 
man, with blond hair peppered with gray, and eyes a lighter shade of 
blue than Serenity&#146;s climbed out of the car. &#147;That&#146;s your dad?&#148; Serenity 
nodded, looking troubled. &#147;Yes&#133;&#148; she gasped when she saw another man 
climb out of the luxurious car. Rei turned to her. &#147;Who&#146;s that guy?&#148; 
Serenity shook her head, and stared at her feet. &#147;Endymion&#133;my fianc&eacute;`&#133;&#148;

===================

&#147;We&#146;re almost there!&#148; Mitsuki called, running toward the park. She had 
always loved the spot when she was younger, and it would be a good place 
to hide until they thought of a plan. Minako stopped behind Mitsuki, and 
tried to catch her breath. &#147;Su&#133;Suki-chan&#133;Rei and Usagi&#133;they&#146;re here 
too...look over there ,&#148; she gasped, pointing to the two young women. 
Mitsuki turned to where the blond was pointing and smiled. &#147;Koi, you 
have such good eyes!&#148; Makoto rolled her eyes. &#147;Whatever you two&#133;let&#146;s 
get going..&#148;

===================

Rei gawked at Serenity in disbelief. &#147;Your WHAT?!&#148; Serenity turned to 
Rei. &#147;Rei-chan&#133;didn&#146;t Mina-chan tell you? That&#146;s why I ran away&#133;&#148; Rei 
shook her head. &#147;She told me you had a BOYFRIEND...not a fianc&eacute;`&#133;I&#146;m 
gonna kill her..&#148; Serenity turned to Rei and frowned. &#147;How does that 
change anything?&#148; Rei sighed. &#147;You don&#146;t get it&#133;&#148; Serenity glared at 
her. &#147;What do you mean? I don&#146;t love him, so I left! And I&#133;well&#133;I fell 
in love with you. Daddy will understand!&#148; Rei frowned, and shook her 
head gravely. &#147;You&#146;re&#133;na&iuml;ve, Usagi&#133;Serenity&#133;don&#146;t you get it? Your 
parents don&#146;t care if you&#146;re in love with the guy or not&#133;it&#146;s an 
arranged marriage.&#148; Serenity glared at her. &#147;Daddy wouldn&#146;t make me 
marry him if he knew how I felt! Neither would Mommy! They LOVE me, you 
don&#146;t understand! I&#146;m not na&iuml;ve!&#148; Rei smiled sadly at Serenity, and 
moved to hug her tightly. &#147;You&#133;you have to leave&#133;the police will be here 
soon&#133;I don&#146;t want you to get hurt, ok?&#148; Serenity shook her head 
vehemently, tears welling up in her eyes. &#147;NO! I&#146;ll explain everything 
to the police...and they&#146;ll let you go, and I&#146;ll tell Daddy how I 
feel&#133;and he&#146;ll let me stay with you&#133;&#148; Rei turned away from her. &#147;&#133;No 
they won&#146;t&#133;&#148; Serenity stared at the red head for a moment. &#147;Of&#133;of course 
they will&#133;they won&#146;t just hurt you&#133;I&#146;ll tell the truth&#133;and&#133;they&#146;ll let 
all of you go&#133;&#148; Rei&#146;s shoulder&#146;s slumped, and when she spoke again, it 
was in a defeated tone, one Usagi had never heard before. 

&#147;No&#133;Koi&#133;they won&#146;t&#133;that&#146;s not how it is. The nobles live in their big 
houses and mansions&#133;and us poor people, the &#147;lower class&#148;&#133;we live in 
hovels, buildings with broken windows&#133;and when we try to find a way to 
pull up, they just call us thieves&#133;they won&#146;t see it your way...they&#146;ll 
only see what they want to see...how it has always been.&#148;

&#147;When they look at us together, they don&#146;t see love&#133;they see&#133;&#148; her voice 
cracked, &#147;they see a princess being seduced by some commoner&#133;a thief, a 
criminal&#133;&#148;

Serenity shook her head. &#147;Don&#146;t cry, Rei-chan&#133;I&#146;ll explain&#133;I&#146;ll MAKE 
them understand.&#148; And even though she knew her father was standing just 
a few feet from them, she moved to kiss Rei, to show him, and Endymion, 
and everyone that she truly meant to keep her promise...that she WOULD 
make them understand&#133;

===================

The other girls looked on, and Mitsuki smiled brightly. &#147;That&#146;s 
good...they finally figured it out, ne?&#148; Before any of the others had a 
chance to respond, a gunshot tore through the air&#133;

===================

Drake looked on in shock as Endymion lowered the gun. &#147;My God, 
Endymion&#133;what have you done?&#148; Endymion frowned. &#147;What had to be done, 
sir.&#148;

He did not turn toward Serenity when he heard her scream&#133;</pre>
