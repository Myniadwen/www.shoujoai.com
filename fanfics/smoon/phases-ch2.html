<a href="../smoon/phases-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Makoto&#39;s armor was heavy with sweat and caked on filth
as the warrior princess strode through the camp. The
chakram at her side bounced against her leather skirt,
her long black hair swinging as she walked.

&quot;M&#39;lady,&quot; the serving girl nodded as Makoto reached
the tent, her skimpy dress hugging her sexy form.

&#39;Minako?&#39; Makoto blinked even as she heard herself
ask, &quot;Is the bath ready?&quot;

Minako smiled respectfully, &quot;Of course, ma&#39;am.&quot; She
drew the flap of the tent aside to release sweet
smelling steam, watching with interest as Makoto
entered, &quot;Would you like some assistance, mistress?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Makoto said flatly, well aware of the woman&#39;s
hungry gaze. Undoing the straps and buckles of her
armor a slight smile teased her lips as a thought
occurred to her, &quot;But stay nearby. I may call.&quot;

&quot;I live to serve,&quot; Minako bowed again, slipping out of
the tent with her graceful hips swaying seductively.

Hanging up her breast plate Makoto stripped off her
leather armor, setting it and her weapons in easy
reach before she slid naked into the hot water with a
happy sigh. Bruises and cuts were soothed by the heat
as she simply soaked, letting her aches flow away.
After a time she pulled herself to a sitting position
and began to wash, scrubbing away dirt and grime.

&quot;Ho, girl,&quot; Makoto called out gruffly as she rose,
dripping from the water.

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Minako hurried in, scooping up a long
towel as she saw Makoto&#39;s nakedness. &quot;Should I...?&quot;
she gestured with the cloth.

&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Makoto nodded as she stepped from the now
cooling bath.

Gracefully Minako wrapped the towel around Makoto and
began to dry her, her hands roaming over the taller
woman&#39;s sculpted muscles and strong flesh. Minako
stepped closer as the smaller woman worked, her own
sweet, sweaty scent a pleasant contrast to Makoto&#39;s
usual scents of leather and blood.

&quot;Careful little one,&quot; Makoto purred out a warning as
the girl pressed up against her, the woman&#39;s thin robe
barely hiding her own sweetly shaped body, &quot;teasing a
tiger can be dangerous to your health.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Minako&#39;s look showed she was well aware of the
teasing, and also hopeful of the possible
consequences.

Makoto growled as she stopped the girl&#39;s roaming hands
in their stroking of her breasts, drawing her into a
tight embrace. Her kiss was fierce, possessive, and
Mikako seemed to almost swoon in Makoto&#39;s strong arms.
Uncaring where they were Makoto laid Minako on the
ground nipping at her neck as Minako moaned
breathlessly.

&quot;They call you the conqueror,&quot; Minako gasped as Makoto
tore at her dress, &quot;show me the truth of it!

...with a gasp Makoto came awake, sitting up in her
bed as sweat soaked her body. &quot;Minako?&quot; she blurted,
blinking as she tried to process the new memories.

Vividly Makoto remembered both the taking of the camp
girl in the tent AND the nights that followed as
Minako became her new favorite. A blush colored her
face as some of the more explicit moments flash before
her eyes and she groaned.

&quot;I just pray Ami and the others aren&#39;t having dreams
like mine,&quot; Makoto sighed as she got up from her
sweaty bed and went to have a shower.

Phases: A Sailor Moon Fanfiction

Part Two

Ami Mizuno pushed up her glasses as she strode down
the hall, her long hair in twin ponytails to go with
her Chinese garb. She looked up as she saw and felt a
familiar presence, opened her mouth to say Makoto but
instead, &quot;Morning Kanna.&quot;

Kanna Kirishima smiled back at her, the slightly
rumpled looking fighter yawning sleepily as she
answered. &quot;Morning Li.&quot;

&#39;Li, yes, that&#39;s me,&#39; Ami thought as she smiled back
and impishly asked her, &quot;So, had a rough night?&quot;

&quot;Sumire and I got into a fight again,&quot; Kanna shrugged
with a simple casualness, &quot;we were arguing all night.&quot;

&#39;Arguing?&#39; Ami wondered as she saw the red bite mark
on Makoto&#39;s neck and felt a startling surge of
jealousy. &#39;If they were fighting at all it was on the
battlefield of a bed,&#39; she thought to herself as she
said to her warningly, &quot;You&#39;d better watch it, Ogami
might get upset if he finds out.&quot;

&quot;The Lieutenant doesn&#39;t mind,&quot; Kanna waved that off as
she sauntered off, &quot;now if you don&#39;t mind, I need
breakfast.&quot;

Ami watched her go, cheeks flaming as she considered
what Makoto and her lover might have been doing last
night...

...then with a low moan Ami awoke, gazing up at her
ceiling as a alarm clock loudly chirped away nearby.
&quot;I almost wish I had been able to hear the rest of
it,&quot; Ami sighed as she got up and got dressed.

Later that day, Ami finished relating a somewhat
censored version of her dream. &#39;I wonder what has
Makoto so flustered?&#39; she thought, gazing at Makoto
over the edge of her cup of tea.

&quot;Well,&quot; Luna said after a moment, the black cat
blinking.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure if I should be embarrased or not,&quot; Ami
quietly admitted, her short blue hair swept back from
her face.

&quot;So who was it that Makoto sleeping with?&quot; Minako
asked the question that was on everyone&#39;s mind.

&quot;Mina!&quot; Rei gave her a scolding look.

Minako quickly defended herself, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m alowed to
be curious.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure it was Michiru,&quot; Ami said with a half
smile.

&quot;What?&quot; Minako squeaked, clearly surprised.

&quot;As far as I can tell,&quot; Ami took off her glasses to
rub at her eyes, &quot;she was an actress named Sumire.&quot;

&quot;I bet Haruka wasn&#39;t happy,&quot; Rei noted after a
moment:&quot;assuming she was even there.&quot;

Makoto had that &#39;inward&#39; look that both she and Ami
got when they were searching their inherited memories.
&quot;I think she was,&quot; she frowned.

&quot;Maria Tachibana,&quot; Ami agreed.

&quot;The Russian gunslinger,&quot; Makoto nodded in agreement

&quot;And were the rest of us there?&quot; Usagi asked eagerly.

&quot;Yes, but you were a man,&quot; Makoto noted with some
amusement.

You could have heard a pin drop as everyone in the now
silent room tried to process that startling idea.

&quot;What?&quot; Rei asked faintly.

&quot;Ogami,&quot; Ami agreed, &quot;the Ensign who led us into
battle.&quot;

&quot;Wow,&quot; Mamoru blinked. The young man was still
catching up on the whole reincarnation discussion, and
he looked a bit stunned.

&quot;So, we&#39;re reincarnating as a GROUP?&quot; Usagi asked
quietly.

&quot;It... kind of makes sense,&quot; Artemis conceded after a
moment.

&quot;The souls of the royalty of the moon kingdom are
connected,&quot; Luna admitted, &quot;it seems possible that you
may have been drawn together in various life times.&quot;

&quot;Remind me to talk to Setsuna,&quot; Ami noted, &quot;as Sailor
Pluto she might be able to offer some insight.&quot;

&quot;I assume she&#39;s being reincarnated too,&quot; Mamoru noted.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Makoto blinked, the oddest look passing over
her.

&quot;What?&quot; Rei asked impatiently.

&quot;Maria Tachibana,&quot; Ami said slowly, &quot;was seeing a
female officer...&quot;

Makoto finished, &quot;Who I&#39;m pretty sure was Setsuna&#39;s
incarnation.&quot;

&quot;This just gets better and better,&quot; Minako purred,
nearly bouncing in her seat.

&quot;Mina!&quot; everyone shouted scoldingly.

To be continued...

Notes: The first sequence is, of course, a riff on the
&#39;Xena the conqueror&#39; period before the Xena Warrior
Princess series started. She was a BAD girl and didn&#39;t
care who knew it. Heh. The second bit is a homage to
Sakura Wars, another lovely almost all girl anime.
