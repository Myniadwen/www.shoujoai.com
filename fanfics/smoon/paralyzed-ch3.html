<h1>Paralyzed (part 3 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/atara.html">Atara</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/paralyzed-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;Tell me what?&quot; Rei eyed Minako as she walked past Makoto, sitting down 
on the couch with that look that showed that the priestess wasn&#39;t about 
to take an easy excuse for an answer.

Minako looked like a deer caught in the headlights for a split second, 
Makoto marveling as she swore she could see the thought process flying 
through Minako&#39;s brain as she formulated a &#39;battle strategy&#39; to handle 
this new problem. Makoto rubbed the back of her neck lightly and just 
shrugged when Minako glanced up at her.

Rei recognized the setting of Minako&#39;s jaw that usually came when she 
made a decision, able to read her best friend&#39;s moods better than likely 
most others aside from Artemis. For her own part, she was hiding a fair 
bit of nervousness, knowing it would be unseen below Makoto&#39;s, which was 
practically visible in the air, and Minako&#39;s that sat just below the 
surface of her eyes. Startled to have walked in and creating such a 
tense situation, Rei quickly weighed her options. Minako had been a 
little dodgy about some things lately whenever they talked, and it 
involved Makoto, at least, that was apparent to Rei now. She wanted an 
answer, but she also didn&#39;t want to anger Minako by being too pressing. 
&quot;Well?&quot;

Minako cleared her throat and closed her eyes for a moment, smiling 
lightly as she opened them, looking Rei straight in the eye, the Senshi 
of Mars feeling the slight challenge from the Senshi of Venus, though 
she wasn&#39;t sure why, just yet. &quot;Rei...I&#39;m in love with Makoto, and told 
her so. She accepted it, and feels the same...&quot; Makoto could see the 
faintest tremor of Minako&#39;s hands, but Rei was locked in the blonds&#39; 
eyes and the challenge to say something negative, not noticing the 
shaking.

Rei couldn&#39;t help herself, and let the laugh loose that had bubbled to 
the surface, it doubling when she saw the startled look on Minako&#39;s 
face. &quot;That&#39;s it? Dammit Minako, I thought you were going to tell me you 
were pregnant or something!&quot;

Makoto slapped her forehead as Minako had to grab onto the back of the 
couch to keep herself from falling over in shock. &quot;What! Rei, me, 
pregnant!&quot; She leaned over and whapped the dark haired girl on the arm, 
mortified at the suggestion, but unable and unwilling to hide her relief 
as she sat on the couch facing Rei, sitting on her legs.

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;d like to see you accomplish that, considering.&quot; Makoto smirked 
and dodged the pillow thrown at her.

Rei lightly punched Minako on the arm. &quot;What else was I supposed to 
expect? You&#39;ve been acting weird lately, and then I walk in hearing &#39;how 
are we going to tell Rei?&#39; and you were two steps from freaking out when 
you saw me. Gee, first thing that comes to mind is something bad, not 
something good like this!&quot;

Minako blinked. &quot;So you&#39;re not..?&quot;

Rei arched an eyebrow and eyed Minako again, crossing her arms over her 
chest. &quot;What, you expected me to be upset? I&#39;m more upset by the fact 
that you didn&#39;t tell me you had a crush on Mako-chan than by finding out 
that you feel that way, Minako-chan.&quot; Makoto wandered into the kitchen 
to start putting things together to go, letting the two talk.

Minako practically tackled Rei to the couch as she hugged her. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry I didn&#39;t tell you! I just, I didn&#39;t know, and I was so confused by 
everything, and I didn&#39;t want to face the thought that I could lose both 
of you. I mean, I know it&#39;s you, and stuff, and I wasn&#39;t worried about 
it this morning, but the more I thought of telling you the more nervous 
I got...&quot;

Rei rolled her eyes a little, but smiled as she hugged the blond. &quot;Baka 
Minako. Like any of us would have a problem with it. We care about you, 
and you too, Mako-chan.&quot; Rei looked to the kitchen, where Makoto blushed 
and smiled a little sheepishly.

&quot;There&#39;s still that teeny chance, Rei-chan, I felt it too.&quot; Makoto 
walked back into the living room, setting the basket she had just packed 
down by the door.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s about time you two realized it.&quot; Rei smirked as she managed 
to get the two girls to freeze in place again.

&quot;Wait, what?&quot; Minako leaned back from hugging Rei, it her turn to eye 
the other girl.

Rei gestured in the air a little, brushing a bit of her bangs aside as 
she pulled a visor out of her bag and started putting it on. &quot;You were 
subtle about it, but I could tell you two were thinking of it. I 
wouldn&#39;t be surprised if someone else tells you &#39;about time&#39; too.&quot;

Makoto smacked her forehead again. &quot;That&#39;s why Ami would ask me how our 
shopping trips or whatever would go whenever I went out with just you, 
Minako. She never asked that when I&#39;d go out with Usagi or you, Rei.&quot;

Minako groaned, then laughed. &quot;Guess the saying about how your friends 
often know you better than you yourself do is true.&quot;

Nodding, Rei glanced at her watch. &quot;I can say with much confidence that 
you&#39;ll have no problem talking to Ami-chan and Usagi-chan. You might 
want to do it in private at some point while we&#39;re at Haruka and 
Michiru&#39;s. How about them?&quot;

Minako blushed faintly. &quot;I actually asked them for advice on how to talk 
about it with Mako-chan.&quot;

Makoto chuckled. &quot;The Senshi of Love asking for advice, that&#39;s new.&quot; Rei 
laughed lightly and nodded in agreement.

Huffing, Minako wrinkled her nose in a way that made Makoto get a little 
flutter inside for a moment. &quot;When it comes to things involving -me-, 
I&#39;m clueless and just as lost as the next person. It&#39;s hard to look at 
my own situation and give myself advice on how to deal with it.&quot; She 
stuck her tongue out and pouted, crossing her arms.

Rei tilted her head slightly, her long hair drifting over her shoulder 
with the motion. &quot;You know, that makes sense. Kinda sucks though. The 
rest of us can at least apply our augmented senses to our &#39;elements&#39; to 
our life.&quot;

Minako rolled her eyes a little as she stood and walked into the 
kitchen. &quot;Guh, tell me about it. Totally unfair.&quot; She picked up a 
wrapped plate and walked back, offering it to Rei with a crooked smile. 
&quot;Here, I made you some chocolate chip cookies.&quot;

&quot;Ooh, you can make those well, you manage to burn other things like 
Usagi does.&quot; Rei took the plate, blinking when Makoto burst into 
laughter, Minako throwing her hands in the air and walking down the 
hallway.

&quot;You&#39;re both against me, I swear! Let me put the towels in the bag with 
our clothes and we can go.&quot;

&quot;Either of you talk to Ami or Usagi?&quot; Rei snuck a cookie out from under 
the plastic wrap before putting the rest into her bag.

Makoto nodded. &quot;Briefly, called Ami, she said she was going to stop over 
at Usagi&#39;s and the two were going to take the bus. Mamoru-san had to 
work or something.&quot;

Rei smirked. &quot;Well, they&#39;ll either be on time if Ami can drag Usagi to 
the bus, or they&#39;ll be terribly late if Usagi makes them miss the first 
one.&quot;

Walking back with a bag slung over her shoulder, Minako laughed. &quot;Aw, 
Usagi&#39;s not that bad anymore. &#39;cides, I don&#39;t think we exactly have a 
strict time to get there. Though, Michiru-san is a little twitchy about 
it, isn&#39;t she?&quot;

&quot;Sounds like someone else we know.&quot; Makoto gave an obvious head-tilt to 
Rei, who was looking at her watch and missed the look, Minako giggling.

Rei huffed a little, knowing the statement was directed towards her 
anyway. &quot;Bah, nothing wrong with being on time. I&#39;m the only one around 
here outside of Ami who doesn&#39;t have to run to school! Come on you two 
goofs.&quot; She picked up her bag, holding the door open with a &#39;get a move 
on!&#39; look, smiling lightly to herself when Makoto offered Minako her 
arm.

The three made a giggling, fast talking pack that moved down the street 
to the bus stop, getting there with plenty of time to spare. A 
relatively short bus ride later, and they were walking up the long 
driveway to the Outer Senshi&#39;s home. The rev of an engine and honk of a 
horn made all of them jump and laugh, turning around.

Haruka grinned from the drivers seat of her car, lifting her sunglasses 
and winking at the three as she pulled up along side, idling and 
matching their pace, chuckling at the chorus of hello&#39;s. &quot;Hello girls. 
Making sure someone other than you is on time, huh Rei-chan?&quot;

&quot;Just trying to teach by example, Haruka-san.&quot; Rei grinned, holding her 
bag behind her back with both hands.

Haruka couldn&#39;t help but grin a little wider as she noticed Minako and 
Makoto holding hands. &quot;Well, I just got the charcoal for the grill, so 
it&#39;s quite a while until food will be ready, but go ahead and walk 
around the side of the house to the back, Michiru should be out back, or 
Setsuna.&quot; She waved as she pulled ahead and up to her garage on the side 
as the three deviated from the driveway and across the lawn.

&quot;Rei-chan! Mako-chan! Minako-chan!&quot; A voice called out from behind them, 
Usagi running across the lawn, dragging Ami behind her. &quot;Ohayo!&quot; She 
nearly tripped, Ami pulling back just enough to keep Usagi from 
faceplanting in the lawn.

&quot;Ami-chan dragged you out in time for the bus, hey Usagi-chan?&quot; Makoto 
reached out to take the basket Ami was carrying, faintly bushing as the 
blue haired girl gave her a slight look, she no doubt having noticed the 
holding of hands.

&quot;Actually, she was waiting for me.&quot; Ami handed off the basket, smirking 
slightly at Makoto&#39;s reaction to it&#39;s weight.

&quot;Yeah, I was! These get togethers are so much fun, and really, I wanted 
to get out of the house.&quot; Usagi adjusted the brim of her hat.

&quot;Seriously? You were really on time?&quot; Rei looked completely dumbfounded, 
and looked over to Minako. &quot;Remind me to consult the fire when I get 
home tonight, something must be up.&quot;

Minako giggled while Usagi got a little red in the face, puffing up 
defensively. &quot;I&#39;m not always late!&quot;

&quot;Yes you are!&quot; Four voices chorused, and broke down into laughter while 
Usagi continued to pout.

&quot;Now now, there&#39;s a first time for everything.&quot; Michiru&#39;s voice broke 
through the laughter as they rounded the corner into the backyard, the 
older woman glancing up from where she was stretched out on a deck 
lounger, looking over the rim of her sunglasses. &quot;Usagi was bound to 
catch up with herself at some point.&quot;

Minako and Ami continued to giggle as they claimed two of the other deck 
chairs for themselves, cooperating as they pulled out towels, sunblock 
and other needed items for spending an afternoon and evening poolside. 
Makoto walked the two baskets over to Setsuna, who walked out of the 
house and gestured over to the little outdoor kitchen for her. Rei 
grinned at Usagi, who was giving a pitiful look to Michiru.

&quot;Not you too, Michiru-san!&quot; Usagi dramatically held the back of her hand 
up to her forehead. &quot;Oh, woe is me, even my closest friends are against 
me!&quot; She mock swooned, Rei having to fight hard to resist the urge to 
push her into the pool. She settled for lightly whapping the blond on 
the back of the head.

&quot;Consider it motivation to be more on time!&quot; Rei grinned, catching the 
bottle of lotion tossed to her by Minako and starting to apply it.

Usagi wrinkled her nose and stuck her tongue out at Rei, but sat still 
when the raven haired girl walked over to put sunscreen on her back. 
&quot;Okay, okay, I get the point.&quot;

&quot;I can just picture us trying to excuse you from some royal appearance 
in the future that you&#39;d be horribly late to, and I&#39;d likely be the one 
who would have to do it!&quot; Minako giggled, pulling her shirt up over her 
head as she stripped down to her bikini. Playful teasing of Usagi 
continued as the others did likewise.

Setsuna smiled as she caught Makoto staring over the refrigerator door 
at Minako, walking over and gently pushing the door closed. &quot;Have a good 
night last night, Makoto-chan?&quot;

Makoto flushed red as she tore her eyes away and focused on Setsuna. 
&quot;Hai. But that shouldn&#39;t be surprising to you, I suppose?&quot;

Shrugging, Setsuna peered into Ami&#39;s basket, pulling out two salads and 
holding them out to Makoto to put in the fridge. &quot;Not everything about 
the future is set, afterall. But...there was a strong probability for 
it, yes.&quot; She smiled, looking over towards the house as Haruka and 
Hotaru came out, the smaller teen walking oddly as she tried to blow up 
a beachball and walk at the same time.

Still blushing lightly, Makoto simply nodded, setting the salads into 
the fridge and standing back from it slightly, eying the amount of food 
her and Ami&#39;s items, combined with what was already there, added up to. 
&quot;We cook for an army.&quot;

&quot;With the appetites of some of us, we need to.&quot; Haruka set down the bag 
of charcoal next to the grill. &quot;I&#39;ve yet to see any leftovers amounting 
to more than a plateful or so when we all get together for food and 
such.&quot;

Makoto giggled. &quot;True.&quot; A shriek followed by a splash drew their 
attention, Rei laughing as she apparently gave into temptation and 
pushed Usagi off the end of the diving board into the water, a second 
shriek of surprise coming from her as Minako turned the hose onto Rei 
with a triumphant &#39;Ha-ha!&#39;, making her have to jump in to escape the 
cold jet of water. Usagi laughed and cheered the retaliation, and 
quickly fled from Rei&#39;s reach. Hotaru threw the beach ball at Minako, 
she and Ami laughing as the blond over-dramatized being hit, eventually 
&#39;stumbling&#39; into the water as she was defeated. Eventually, everyone but 
Setsuna was in the pool, playful races to beach ball tag going on as the 
afternoon wore on.

As the sun hung heavy in the sky, food was prepared and shared, music 
put on, and a bonfire lit a short distance away from the pool. Casual 
conversation centering around the upcoming school year bubbled through 
the air, interspersed with random comments on the current idols or 
movies in the theaters. Michiru nudged Makoto&#39;s side and whispered 
something into her ear, and after blushing lightly, she nodded.

&quot;Minako, Ami, help me with the deserts?&quot; Makoto stood from her place 
about the fire, smiling a little crookedly, hoping that the dim light 
hid the look of nervousness from her eyes.

Ami raised an eyebrow slightly but shrugged, standing. &quot;Sure?&quot;

Minako was quickly up and halfway to the outdoor kitchen even before Ami 
stood as Usagi piped up. &quot;If there&#39;s icecream, I want some with whatever 
it is you brought, Mako-chan.&quot;

Makoto laughed. &quot;And what if the ice cream technically doesn&#39;t go with 
what I brought?&quot;

&quot;She wants some anyway.&quot; Rei grinned, crossing her arms behind her head 
as she leaned back in her lounge chair. &quot;Me too, actually.&quot;

Makoto chuckled as she turned to follow Ami. &quot;Okay, okay, everyone gets 
ice cream.&quot;

Minako was halfway into the fridge as Ami came up next to her. &quot;Do we 
have that much?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I think everyone made or brought some sort of desert. Not that 
that&#39;s a bad thing.&quot; Minako pulled out two pies, tilting her head 
towards the freezer. &quot;There&#39;s vanilla in the freezer, and grab that bowl 
of fruit, please.&quot;

Ami nodded and did as asked while Makoto got out two trays and some 
bowls. They cut up the pie and prepared plates in a moment of silence 
before Ami lightly cleared her throat. &quot;So, what is it that has you two 
so nervous?&quot;

Minako glanced up at Makoto, the two making eye contact for a moment as 
Minako seemed to be urging Makoto to speak. Biting her lower lip, Makoto 
sighed lightly. &quot;That obvious?&quot;

&quot;No, at least, not until now. Is something the matter?&quot; Ami set down the 
knife she was holding and turned towards Makoto, concern shining in her 
blue eyes.

&quot;Oh, no no, nothing&#39;s wrong, just..&quot; Makoto rubbed behind her neck, a 
familiar nervous gesture of hers. &quot;Just...well...Ami..Minako and 
I..well..&quot; The tall girl took a deep breath, deciding to borrow some of 
Minako&#39;s words from earlier in the day. &quot;...I&#39;m in love with Minako, and 
told her, and..&quot; She smiled a little crookedly and reached out, taking 
Minako&#39;s hand in hers, the blond smiling reassuringly, though she looked 
nervous as well. &quot;..I guess we&#39;re going out now.&quot;

Ami blinked and glanced between Minako and Makoto. &quot;You were nervous 
about that?&quot; She smiled reassuringly as the two looked a little 
startled, moving forward and giving Makoto a tight hug. &quot;I&#39;m happy for 
you two! It&#39;s about time...&quot;

&quot;Gah, you and Rei, same thing.&quot; Makoto laughed, picking up Ami a bit in 
the tight hug before putting the shorter girl down.

&quot;You talked with Rei?&quot; Ami reached out and squeezed Minako&#39;s hand, still 
smiling.

&quot;Yeah, earlier today when she came over to head here with us.&quot; Minako 
looked relieved, but not quite as much as Makoto did, who looked as if 
she had just been told that she passed a difficult test.

&quot;So, you&#39;re okay with it?&quot; Makoto fidgeted a little still, despite her 
relief.

&quot;Of course I&#39;m okay with it.&quot; Ami looked faintly taken aback as she 
turned and put the bowls on the two trays. &quot;It&#39;s...not unexpected, 
obviously. I&#39;m a little jealous!&quot; She smiled. &quot;But happy. Your mutual 
attraction wasn&#39;t completely unnoticed. I am observant afterall.&quot; Her 
smile took on a little quirk. &quot;Now, let&#39;s get these over to the others 
before Usagi fidgets out of her chair, shall we?&quot; Ami picked up one 
tray, Makoto grabbing the other as Minako picked up a stack of glasses 
and got a pitcher of tea out of the fridge.

Minako slipped up next to Makoto before they got too far from the 
kitchen, leaning up to kiss the girl on the cheek and lightly murmur to 
her, getting a nod of agreement. &quot;Two down, one to go...&quot;
