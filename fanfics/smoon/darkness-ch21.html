Rei groaned, turning over. She raised her heavily lidded eyes, rubbing 
her aching head. She looked from side to side, noticing that she was in 
her room, lying on her bed. Her eyes narrowed in confusion, not seeing 
her lover beside her.

Suddenly the memory of what had happened struck her hard, causing her to 
cradle her head in her hands, moaning in pain. The memory of the slayers 
invading their room, being hit with a dart, being consumed by darkness.

Rei suddenly sat up, growling under her breath for the sharp pain head 
in her head. When the pain faded, she took a deep breath, &quot;Where&#39;s 
Serena?,&quot; she whispered.

She unsteadily got off the bed, and tripped her way across the room to 
the door. She opened the door, and nearly collapsed, feeling 
lightheaded. She gained her posture and leaned herself against the wall, 
making her way, slowly down the hall.

Nearing the den, she saw that everyone was knocked out along the floor. 
Rei looked at them, then made her way towards the kitchen. Upon entering 
she saw that everyone was in the same state as everyone else in the den.

She heard someone stir and saw that it was Michelle. Rei made her way 
over to the elder woman as fast as she could, nearly stepping on the 
people that lay sprawled on the floor. She fell to her knees, sitting 
beside Michelle. She helped the woman sit up, leaning against her 
shoulder.

&quot;Oh, my head,&quot; mumbled Michelle, holding her head groggily. Her eyes 
turned to Rei.

&quot;What happened?,&quot; 

&quot;We were attacked by the slayers,&quot; Michelle&#39;s eyes widened in 
remembrance. 

&quot;Oh my God, Serena!,&quot; exclaimed the turquoise haired woman. Rei held a 
worried look.

&quot;Michelle-mama, where&#39;s Serena?,&quot; asked the raven haired girl. Michelle 
looked at the teen. 

&quot;They took her,&quot; 

Rei looked at her in shock, &quot;What?!?,&quot;

********

Serena opened her eyes, from sleeping, upon hearing the door knob 
turning.  Her groggy  red eyes stared at the door knob in aggravation. 
She was starving and was in a pissy mood. All she wanted was to go home 
and be with Rei and her family, but no, she had to stay in this crappy 
dark room, and was becoming very hungry.

When the door opened, she saw that it was Darien and he was holding 
something. She turned her head to the side and noticed that it was a 
water bottle. She stared at the bottle, fangs bared. Darien looked at 
her and smiled when he noticed that she was staring at the bottle that 
lay in his  hands.

He tossed it from hand to hand and nearly burst out in laughter, when he 
saw her eyes moved along with the bottle. He grinned and walked closer 
to her and kneeled in front of her.

&quot;I see that your hungry,&quot; gesturing towards her fangs and eyes.

Serena glared, &quot;Yeah and your point is?,&quot; 

Darien smiled, &quot;Well I just thought that you might want something to 
eat,&quot;

Serena eyed him as he took the bottle that was in his hand, and pop open 
the cap. He then brought the bottle to her lips. She looked at it oddly.

Darien rolled his eyes, &quot;It&#39;s not poisoned or anything, so drink it,&quot;  

She glared at him, then took a sip. Her face scrunched up in disgusted, 
spiting out the blood into Darien&#39;s face. He wiped his face with the 
back of his hand and glared at the girl.

&quot;What the hell was that for?,&quot; exclaimed Darien.

&quot;You&#39;re trying to kill me!,&quot; shouted Serena.

&quot;No I&#39;m not!,&quot;

&quot;Yes you are, because that sure as hell isn&#39;t blood!,&quot;

&quot;Yes it is, it&#39;s deer blood!,&quot; Serena narrowed her eyes.

&quot;DEER BLOOD!, why the hell are you giving me deer blood!?,&quot;

&quot;Well I hope you weren&#39;t expecting human blood,&quot;

Serena turned her head, &quot;That stuff is bitter and disgusting?it need 
sugar?LOTS OF SUGAR!,&quot;

Darien chuckled, &quot;Yea yea, aren&#39;t you getting a little bossy and 
stubborn,&quot; mumbled Darien, walking out of the room.

Serena huffed and looked to the floor, &quot; Who in their right mind would 
give someone deer blood,&quot;

********

Everyone within the vampires&#39; household sat in a den, pissed beyond 
belief. The slayers has trespassed in to their home which was bad 
enough, but to make it worse, they kidnapped one of their own. Some one 
who they all loved dearly, and that was Serena.

Artemis stood from his seat, pacing back and forth, face contorted in 
anger, &quot;I cant believe this happened. We were so unprepared. Not only 
did they break into here, our home,  they went and took Serena!,&quot;

&quot;Look Artemis, I know that you&#39;re upset, but you need to calm down. We 
will bring Serena back, and that is a promise!,&quot; said Luna in a strained 
voice.

&quot;Well we cant just go after them, this is an emergency. We have to get 
the others,&quot; replied Setsuna.

Artemis whipped her head around, &quot;Are sure that is necessary?,&quot;

Setsuna nodded, &quot;I believe so, I predict that this is going to be huge. 
We are going to need help and plenty of it. This battle is going to be 
bloody, and our lives are going to be depending on it this,&quot;

Artemis sighed, &quot;Alright, we don&#39;t have a second to waist. So lets get a 
move on and get prepared,&quot;

Everyone looked at each other, determination burning in their eyes. They 
nodded their heads in agreement, and got up from their seats to prepare 
what was to come.

*********

Serena sat in a corner of her room, untied, slowing sipping on the water 
bottle of blood. Darien leaned against the wall, watching her closely. 
Serena could feel his eyes on her and shifted them to him. She glared at 
him and then went back to her drink, gulping down the last drop.

Darien grinned, and pushed himself off the wall, &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot;

Serena looked back to him, &quot;And to where am I going?,&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll see when you get there, now let&#39;s go,&quot;

Serena rolled her eyes, &quot;What ever,&quot;

She stood to her feet and walked over to Darien in a slow lagging pace. 
Darien glared at her, &quot;My God, can you move any slower?,&quot;

Serena grinned, &quot; Actually I can,&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t get smart with me, now lets go!,&quot;

Serena laughed, &quot;Yea yea,&quot;  

The duo walked out of the room and down the hallway. They saw many 
slayers along the way to their destination. They all sneered at Serena 
as she walked by, as she did the same in return. They came up upon a 
room and stopped.

Darien turned to Serena, &quot;This is where we train our slayers, to become 
powerful,&quot;

He then opened the door and they walked  inside. Serena was surprised, 
upon seeing so many slayers in one room at one time. All of them in 
training gear, training to become more powerful, powerful enough to kill 
us vampires.

Serena looked around the room in astonishment, &quot;And this is our training 
room,&quot; declared Darien.

Serena scanned the room, and her eyes caught sight on one particular 
woman. A woman that sparked a memory in her mind. Serena took a step 
closer to the woman, looking at her in curiosity. When the woman turned 
her head around, Serena&#39;s face went as white as sheets.

&quot;Mom?,&quot;
