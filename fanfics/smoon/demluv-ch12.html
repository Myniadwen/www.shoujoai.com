  Ikuko finally succumbed to Usagi&#39;s constant 
pleas to see more than one friend at a time, and 
declared her well enough to have multiple 
friends over by Saturday when Usagi&#39;s 
temperature had come down to 101&deg;. 
  Rei reluctantly called Mamoru to let him know 
that Ikuko would allow visitors now. 
  When Setsuna and Mamoru showed up at the door 
Saturday with fresh flowers around three in the 
afternoon, Rei alternated between her desire to 
watch Mamoru like a hawk and the urge to stay 
away from him. But Usagi took the decision away 
from her and reminded her she had duties at the 
shrine that needed her attention before New 
Years. 
  Rei held Usagi tight and kissed her deep blue 
sapphire eyes tenderly, and stated she would be 
back later. 
  Usagi hugged her back. 
  &quot;I love that you want to protect me from 
Mamoru, but its not really necessary. My plan 
has to work Rei, for all of our sakes. I need 
them to feel comfortable, ne? I&#39;ll call you 
when they&#39;ve gone.&quot; 
  Usagi&#39;s nose was still miserably stuffy, and 
it was hard to breath, but she managed a small 
kiss on Rei&#39;s cheek.
  Rei was asked by Ikuko to answer the door 
because she had &#39;chicken hands&#39;. Rei opened the 
door and greeted their guests politely. 
  &quot;Usagi expects you, and requests that you come 
right up.&quot;
  Rei went into the kitchen where Ikuko prepared 
her chicken for marinade. 
  &quot;Ikuko-Mama, I need to go the jinja for 
awhile. Usagi has reminded me that I need to 
make Omamori for the New Year&#39;s festival. Is 
there anything you want me to pick up on the way 
back?&quot; 
  Ikuko smiled at her &#39;other daughter&#39;. 
  &quot;Yes, we are out of Kenji&#39;s coffee and I could 
use some fresh greens and vegetables from your 
garden, if you don&#39;t mind. Dinner is at six, 
sweetheart.&quot; 
  Ikuko washed her hands, put plastic wrap over 
her chicken marinade dish, and found a place in 
the fridge for it. Ikuko handed Rei some money 
and told her to keep the change for the shrine. 
  Rei kissed Ikuko&#39;s cheek and thanked her &#39;mom&#39; 
with a smile. The Tsukino&#39;s home was easily all 
the senshi&#39;s second home because of Ikuko.
  Ikuko swatted Rei&#39;s backside, &quot;Scoot, I&#39;m 
busy!&quot; 
  Ikuko watched in pride as Rei swept out the 
door. She thought about the person the lonely 
miko had become over the years. Yuri&#39;s daughter 
had overcome unbelievable hardships and 
shouldered responsibilities no adult would 
approach. She had become a statuesque, poised, 
and graceful young lady. 
  Rei was easily one of the most gorgeous girls 
she had ever seen in her life... besides Usagi, 
of course. She had a quick wit, and a hot 
temper... usually over as soon as it began. Rei 
was very controlled, mysterious and secretive. 
Her features ranged from hard, to emotionless, 
which made her seem much older. 
  She moved with the quiet assurance of a lethal 
ninja warrior. Come to think of it, Usagi and 
all her closest friends did. Odd. Ikuko most 
often felt intimidated by Rei, though. That is 
until recently.
  Tenderness and care had softened the hard 
edges. It seemed Usagi&#39;s love had once again 
worked its magic, and pierced through the dark 
recesses of yet another cold, angry, hurt heart. 
Usagi&#39;s love resembled a dagger made of light, 
Ikuko mused. 
  Somewhere along the way, Ikuko feared, her 
friend&#39;s daughter and her own had fallen in 
love. They needed one another, and &#39;wanted&#39; each 
other... the same way she needed and wanted 
Kenji. Perhaps they had always been in love but 
hid from it. 
  Ikuko only knew that Rei had begun to look and 
behave more like an 18 year old, and Usagi had 
grown up a lot to become a beautiful, immensely 
talented young woman. She was more responsible, 
yet still carefree. Usagi still had a penchant 
for guitars and manga. 
  Throughout the ups and downs of her 
relationship with Mamoru, Usagi had more often 
then not wet her pillow over him. Now there 
seemed to be a real peace and joy in both of the 
girls. Ikuko was not going to take that from 
them, she decided. Perhaps it was mere 
curiosity, and it would just play itself out.

                   * * *            
  Upstairs, yet another drama took place. 
Setsuna sat next to Usagi on the bed and hugged 
the girl gingerly because she looked so pale and 
fragile. How she loved her princess!
  Mamoru, however, sat uncomfortably on Usagi&#39;s 
computer chair. His eyes shifted between his 
hands on his lap, and the tidied clutter... 
obviously the result of a fastidious Rei. Usagi 
coughed into a tissue Setsuna held for her. The 
maternal scene made him fidget. His ears still 
seemed to burn with Rei&#39;s accusations.
  Setsuna expressed how sorry she was that her 
princess was so ill, she would have come sooner, 
but it had only recently come to her attention. 
  Usagi assured her that it was all right... her 
Mom wouldn&#39;t have let her in, anyway. She 
coughed again. 
  &quot;Princess, does this meeting have anything to 
do with my daughter, Celeste? Are you still 
angry at me for how I treated her?&quot;
  Usagi recovered her breath and cleared some 
phlegm away before she spoke with a husky voice.
  &quot;This has everything to do with your daughter 
Celeste. I don&#39;t quite understand why you made 
the attempt on her life after the transfer of 
Gaea&#39;s Earth powers. I am angry with you. I am 
glad Aradia and Hotaru intervened, and you 
failed in your attempt to kill her. Frankly, I 
don&#39;t think you could have ever forgiven 
yourself, had you succeeded. I think we&#39;ve all 
suffered enough in the name of destiny, don&#39;t 
you, Setsuna-sama? 
  Celeste was not a &#39;mistake&#39;, nobody is. What 
she tried to do was noble. You need to forgive 
her. Everything will work out in accordance with 
the original parameters set by Gaea&#39;s destiny 
oath. I assume of course, that to protect Gaea&#39;s 
will is your agenda. I assure you it will 
happen... just differently. Please trust me, 
Setsuna.&quot; Usagi pecked her on the cheek and 
smiled at her.
  Setsuna flushed at what Usagi implied, but 
responded calmly.
  &quot;I will try, my princess.&quot; Setsuna gently 
brushed Usagi&#39;s bangs from her eyes. 
  Usagi coughed again, harder, and Setsuna wiped 
away the tears that had squeezed from her eyes. 
Then she handed her a tissue for her nose. 
  Usagi took a drink of water to wet her throat. 
  &quot;Sorry. I&#39;m ok, now,&quot; Usagi resumed, &quot;I asked 
you both here primarily because I require a 
favor of you.&quot; She cleared her throat again and 
took another drink. 
  &quot;Mamoru, I started to get sick after Celeste 
transferred her powers to you. I never connected 
my slight ague and weakness to you, and I never 
considered my condition to be serious. I just 
figured we were both stressed out, and I would 
feel better when things ironed themselves out. 
But then you started to... really hurt me. 
  I&#39;m sorry if I offended you when I requested 
that we not see each other for a while.&quot; 
  Usagi paused, not knowing quite how to 
continue.
  &quot;I went to the jinja to help Rei, and she 
noticed I had some unusual bruises on my neck. 
She urged me to see her doctor, and that&#39;s where 
you come in, Setsuna-sama. 
  When Dr. Wakai looked at me, she insisted my 
that boyfriend get some professional help... 
which means you. Or, she said, my boyfriend can 
expect to be... and I quote, &#39;prosecuted to the 
fullest extent of the law&#39; end quote.&quot; 
  Usagi could plainly see Mamoru&#39;s anger and 
embarrassment as his face contorted.
  She addressed him gently. 
  &quot;I want only to help you because I love you, 
Mamo-chan. I have chosen Setsuna to take your 
case for a reason. I&#39;m not exactly thrilled with 
the idea that the future King of Crystal Tokyo 
needs... therapy. I certainly don&#39;t want it to 
become public knowledge. 
  Mamo, I also feel that it would be best if you 
acknowledged the fact that our soul-mate bond 
has been severed. I ask you to release us from 
our marriage engagement, until a way can be 
found to restore our soul bond.&quot; 
  Usagi waited for an eruption. It never came. 
  Setsuna&#39;s normally dusky, olive skinned, face 
turned sheet white. She looked as though she had 
seen her whole life flash before her eyes in 
that moment before death. 
  Mamoru stared at the multitude of cards taped 
to the wall in stony silence. 
  That went well. Usagi sighed and broke the 
silence. She spoke again softly.
  &quot;You know, sometimes seemingly really awful 
things have to happen in order for a greater 
purpose to be realized. This may well be one of 
those times. Can&#39;t we be a little flexible and 
believe that a greater good is worth the 
compromise?&quot;
  Usagi felt overwhelmed by a sudden wave of 
fatigue. As it washed over her she felt 
defeated... as though she hadn&#39;t gotten 
anywhere. She shook with coughs again, and she 
felt her temperature begin to rise. This had 
taken way more out of her than she had 
anticipated. Her head was stuffy and throbbed 
mercilessly. She laid it back onto the pillows, 
closed her eyes, and fought unsuccessfully with 
her coughs.
  Mamoru rose from his perch on the edge of the 
computer chair, and cleared the hoarseness from 
his throat. 
  &quot;I think I need to go... refresh your glass of 
water, Usagi. I&#39;ll be back later.&quot;
  &quot;Thank you Mamo-chan, I need to speak with 
Setsuna privately, anyway. Don&#39;t be long, 
though.&quot; Usagi smiled wanly at him.
  Setsuna caressed Usagi&#39;s pale, thin, cheek, 
then felt her hot forehead. She and Celeste had 
taken care of the small princess many times 
during the Silver Millennium when she was ill, 
but this was different. She is so sick, Setsuna 
thought. This isn&#39;t good for her...
  &quot;I can see how hard this has been on you, 
Usagi. Perhaps we should wait until you are 
really better, and can think straighter.&quot;
  Usagi eyes remained closed as she responded 
civilly. 
  &quot;Setsuna-sama, I am perfectly lucid right now, 
and I&#39;ve waited long enough for this day. I 
believe at this juncture in time, it is my 
choice alone to serve destiny in the manner I 
feel is most appropriate. Not yours. 
  I have decided I will rebuild the Silver 
Millennium, and take my Mother&#39;s place... alone. 
I will fulfill Gaea&#39;s oath, and rule the Moon 
Kingdom in concert with King Endymion&#39;s Earth 
Kingdom. We will be united as one, politically, 
and defensively. We will help one another 
economically. I shall serve whatever greater 
purpose there is in store for us, as long as 
that purpose is made in love for mankind. 
  As for today, I believe with all my heart that 
any decisions made in love for others will serve 
a greater good, and the sacrifices will be 
worthwhile.&quot; 
  Setsuna waited patiently, she knew there was 
more to be said.
  Usagi coughed phlegm into a tissue, and 
cleared her throat to rid it of its hoarseness. 
  &quot;I know it must seem as though I have made 
some irrational decisions, but my mind has not 
been idle while I&#39;ve had to lay here! 
  I think you already know Mamoru is now your 
soul mate, courtesy of your daughter, but what 
she did was done in love and, it&#39;s all right, 
Setsuna-sama. Who knows, she may have even 
inadvertently made everything better... fate 
perhaps, and certainly water under the bridge. 
  I&#39;m a firm believer in love, though, and think 
it should be given a chance... even if it seems 
to take a rather unconventional path.&quot; Usagi 
opened her eyes and smiled affectionately at her 
old Silver Millennium &#39;nanny&#39;. 
  Setsuna slowly smiled back, not convinced by 
either Usagi&#39;s logic, or her convictions.
  Usagi noticed, and rolled her eyes. 
  &quot;Every self-sacrifice I&#39;ve ever made for the 
sake of loving others... has been worth it. You 
aren&#39;t really living, until you&#39;ve found a 
purpose worth dying for. My purpose is to bring 
hope and love to where there is none, and I will 
gladly die for the sake of my purpose.&quot; Usagi 
coughed deeply behind a tissue. 
  Setsuna was concerned for her princess and 
rubbed her chest gently before she spoke softly.
  &quot;Sweetie, what is it you want to tell me? Is 
it that you feel the need to sacrifice yourself 
again to save someone? I think you need more 
rest, and less sacrifice at this point! You 
haven&#39;t even spoken to Mamoru yet.&quot; 
  Usagi snorted. 
  &quot;That&#39;s because he wanted to run away!
  My point is this, Setsuna-sama... I want you 
to forgive yourself for what you have deemed as 
past mistakes, face your demons, and please let 
me share your burdens.  
  Mamoru and I will never be as we were before, 
and it is not fair to either one of us to force 
ourselves into an incompatible relationship for 
millennia. When he realizes his soul-bond to 
you, I don&#39;t want to be... in the way.&quot;
  Usagi&#39;s eyes watered, and her jaw trembled, 
but she met Setsuna&#39;s eyes. 
  &quot;If Mamoru releases me from our engagement, 
I want you to love him for me, and help him 
through his problems. I want him to be your 
purpose for living. My greatest wish is for 
the both of you to find love and happiness.&quot; 
  Usagi leaned towards Setsuna, kissed her 
cheek, and whispered, &quot;Sets-chan, let me end 
your burden of loneliness, please accept the 
sacrifice I made in love for you both. Please 
respect my decision to resurrect the Silver 
Millennium as a viable option for Gaea&#39;s 
destiny oath.
  If it helps you, I will personally take blame 
for any current disturbances in the timeline 
created by my decisions. This situation may, or
may not, be permanent. If it isn&#39;t, you will 
always be blessed by your offspring, Sets-chan.&quot;
  Setsuna&#39;s eyes brimmed over with tears of 
untold pain her Princess had understood. Usagi 
hadn&#39;t called her by that name since she was a 
small princess in the Moon Kingdom. 
  She squeezed her princess&#39; hand, and dimpled. 
  &quot;All right, Usagi, you win... for now. I 
understand, and I thank you for your love to me. 
I love you too, My Queen. I will seriously 
consider your proposal.&quot; 
  Usagi&#39;s eyes gleamed in response. 
  &quot;There is something else I require of you... 
share implies a two-way interaction. I have kept 
no secrets from you. You know my agenda and my 
motives. I&#39;ve bared my soul to you. I expect no 
less from you. I want you to come to me with 
everything, even if it causes me pain. Confide 
in me, council me... trust in me. I don&#39;t like 
to make decisions in ignorance, I would much 
rather make informed ones.&quot; 
  Setsuna sat still, and quietly studied Usagi 
for a few moments before she reluctantly 
answered her. 
  &quot;Hai Your Majesty, I will.&quot; She leaned close 
and kissed Usagi&#39;s cheek caringly, &quot;My little 
princess has truly grown up.&quot; 
  Usagi implored her, &quot;Don&#39;t tell anybody, 
Sets-chan!&quot;  
  Setsuna laughed at her.
  Mamoru made his appearance once again. He had 
heard the laughter, and figured it was safe to 
come in. He had reached his own conclusions, and 
walked with purpose over to Usagi and knelt on 
one knee by her bedside, opposite from Setsuna. 
He took a long delicate hand in each of his big 
paws, laid his head upon Usagi&#39;s chest, and gave 
a shuddered sigh. 
  Usagi&#39;s tears began to slowly trickle down her 
cheeks. 
  Setsuna felt their need for privacy, and 
started to excuse herself. 
  Mamoru&#39;s eyes glistened as he raised his dark 
head to face her, and captured one of her hands 
in his own. 
  &quot;Stay, Setsuna, this ends now. You need to 
know the truth about me, for Usako&#39;s sake.&quot; 
  Mamoru sniffed and turned to his lover. 
  &quot;Usako, I am so sorry I hurt you. I hate 
myself for my inability to control myself. You 
are right, Usagi, I do need help. I need to find 
out who I am... who I&#39;ve become... so I can help 
and not hurt. 
  I did feel our soul bond break, and went a 
little crazy, but it&#39;s not an excuse. I don&#39;t 
deserve your forgiveness, but I can&#39;t go on 
without it, I can&#39;t go on with this guilt. 
Please forgive me, Usako. I accept and thank you 
for your gracious offer.&quot; Mamoru looked with 
sincerity into his beloved&#39;s wan face.
  Usagi&#39;s fingers trembled as she ruffled the 
dark hair she adored so much and answered him 
consolingly. 
  &quot;Yes, of course I&#39;ll forgive you, my love. All 
I have ever wanted for you is your happiness, 
even if it means without me, darling. I will 
always love you, soul mate or not. We&#39;ve gone 
through way too much together to just throw it 
all away. 
  Forever is a long time to live without a soul 
bond to help us, though. The fates created soul 
mates because we live such a long time, and that 
is why I asked you to release us, Mamo-chan. 
  You know, I could really use a big brother and 
a handsome knight in shining armor.&quot; Usagi 
smiled gently at him as she swept Mamoru&#39;s tears 
lovingly from his cheeks.
  Mamoru choked out his reply in a hoarse 
whisper, &quot;I... I release you, my love.&quot; He 
slowly, tentatively, pulled his ring from his 
lover&#39;s delicate left ring finger, which he 
kissed.
  He brought his chin up so that he could gaze 
into Usagi&#39;s sapphire blue eyes. 
  &quot;I promise I&#39;ll be the best big brother you&#39;ve 
ever seen, and will fight like a maniac by your 
side.&quot; Mamoru affirmed. 
  He leaned forward to kiss her lips, and she 
met him halfway. They kissed as deeply as they 
could with Usagi&#39;s stuffy nose. 
   Then he announced with a ring of finality, 
&quot;My love for you will never stop, Usako. You&#39;re 
not exactly someone a person can ever really get 
over! You will always be my Usako, if that&#39;s all 
right with you. I wish you every happiness, and 
I promise I will make every effort to see that 
you stay that way.&quot; 
  He grinned rakishly, and bowed deeply... 
  &quot;Your merest wish is my command, Queen Usako!&quot;
  Usagi giggled. 
  &quot;I love being your &#39;Usako&#39;, and I thank you, 
Mamoru. &#39;Queen Usako&#39;... I like it! It has a 
certain pizazz, ne?&quot; 
  Usagi turned to face Setsuna. 
  &quot;Setsuna-sama, I need to speak to Mamoru now 
privately, and then I would like to discuss our 
current enemy with you both. Some green tea 
would be delightful, ne?&quot; Usagi winked at 
Setsuna.
  Setsuna&#39;s lips quirked into smile, she bowed, 
and went downstairs to chat with Ikuko.
  Mamoru perched on the bed next to Usagi and 
regarded her quietly for a moment before he 
addressed her. 
  &quot;You want to talk to me about Rei-san, don&#39;t 
you? She is your soul mate, isn&#39;t she?&quot; He 
asked.
  Usagi nodded in affirmation. 
  &quot;Hai, Mamoru. I am her female soul mate, just 
as Jadeite was her male soul mate. When Gaea&#39;s 
spirit within you was altered, our bond was 
broken, and my soul actively sought hers. 
  We have a choice, Mamo-chan. 
  According to my Mother, we can get married, 
use the ginsuishou to build Crystal Tokyo and 
live for millennia without a soul mate bond to 
serve destiny. Or, we can serve destiny and 
re-create the Silver Millennium. 
  The kinsuishou can more than likely be used to 
rebuild the Earth Kingdom. The ginsuishou can 
rebuild the Moon Kingdom, and restore the other 
planets to their original splendor. We can live 
for millennia with our soul mates. 
  Do you wish to serve destiny bound together by 
duty, or with independence and love? I&#39;ll let 
you choose.&quot; 
  Mamoru couldn&#39;t meet Usagi&#39;s intense blue 
sapphire eyes.
  Usagi touched his chin and forced him to look 
at her. 
  &quot;Let me help you. Think about what has 
happened already between us without our soul 
bond in place. Ask yourself who it is your soul 
seeks for completion. Who do you want to share 
your bed with for the next millennia?&quot;
  Mamoru blushed hard. 
  &quot;I am in love with Setsuna, Usagi. I am 
sorry... I hope you can forgive me. I choose 
love over duty.&quot;
  Usagi dimpled. 
  &quot;I&#39;m glad, for that is what I choose also. I 
am in love with Rei, and want to share my life 
with her in the form of a blood bond oath. May 
we have your permission to do so?&quot;
  Mamoru&#39;s eyes glinted with cognizance, in his 
heart, he knew the two women had waited for his 
permission. 
  He answered with the conviction of love for 
her in his voice. 
  &quot;Hai, my love. I don&#39;t ever want you to be 
alone. Even if we were to marry, my duties as 
King would most likely keep us apart for lengthy 
intervals. 
  I would prefer that you did have a permanent 
consort to watch over you, even as you sleep. I 
can&#39;t think of a better protector than Rei. I 
will never stand in the way of your relationship 
with Rei, or keep you from her bed... because I 
love you, and I know you need each other.&quot;
  Usagi was touched by his selflessness. Her 
eyes were moist as she responded, &quot;Oh, Mamo... 
thank you! I already know Chibi-Usa is 
Setsuna&#39;s, and its all right with me... I still 
consider her my daughter.&quot;
  Mamoru felt his face flush. Somehow, in a 
remote part of his heart, when he first had 
looked upon &#39;Chibi Usa&#39; he knew she wasn&#39;t 
Usagi&#39;s.
  Usagi laid her head on Mamoru&#39;s hard, muscled 
chest, and he could feel her fevered hotness. He 
held and rocked her gently to himself.
  Usagi murmured into his shirt, &quot;Mamo, do you 
suggest we marry and create Crystal Tokyo, but
keep our soul mates as our bed partners? Isn&#39;t 
that sort of, um... weird? Can we live that 
way?&quot; She asked, perplexed. 
  Mamoru laughed heartily. 
  &quot;Why not? Can you think of any royal couple 
who isn&#39;t strange in some way? We&#39;ll have all 
the senshi around with their soul mates, and 
tons of children underfoot. So our castle will 
be a huge happy family!&quot;
  Usagi sighed her relief. She hadn&#39;t even 
considered this as an option! She spoke with 
ardor, &quot;What would I ever do without you, Mamo? 
I love you! 
  If we should decide to marry, I want to wait 
until we have both graduated before Crystal 
Tokyo of the new Silver Millennium is created.
  If you decide to marry Setsuna once and for 
all, you have my blessing... because I love both 
of you. However, Mamo, if you do marry her, and 
our bond is restored, I don&#39;t want you to 
abandon her. She has suffered enough.&quot;
  Mamoru squeezed her. 
  &quot;I think I prefer to leave my options open for 
a time, but you can go ahead with your bond to 
Rei... it won&#39;t change anything between you and 
I.&quot; He raised his chin from off the top of her 
head, &quot;Are we finished with our privacy, 
darling?&quot; 
  &quot;Mmmm hmmm.&quot; She replied and nodded against 
him, &quot;you can call Setsuna, your beloved, back 
in.&quot;
  Setsuna came back into the room with tea for 
everyone. She smiled at their closeness. 
  &quot;What happened? You look happy!&quot; 
  &quot;We are,&quot; Usagi responded, &quot;but we will talk 
about it when I feel better. Right now I need to 
talk to you about Valka&#39;s information to me.&quot; 
  She drank some tea and settled comfortably 
against her pillows, her friends crowded close 
on either side of her.
  Usagi began. 
  &quot;Valka mentioned to me that his people search 
for the key to the gates through which will come 
the one who will control the Earth with a power 
that transcends dimensions. I have pondered his 
statement night and day, and have come to some 
conclusions. 
  I think Celeste might have originally the one 
they sought. I believe I heard her say to you, 
Setsuna, that she thought she was the &#39;Gate 
Keeper&#39;, and perhaps she was right. One of two. 
She, however, held Gaea&#39;s powers as first born 
to King Endymion, and the key to control the 
Earth&#39;s power... the kinsuishou, as well. She 
could control time, space, and the Earth with 
power. 
  There can only be one Gate Keeper, ne,
Setsuna? Well, don&#39;t worry... my Mother&#39;s 
beloved is completely defenseless, now, and for
all she knows, abandoned by you.&quot; Usagi&#39;s voice
was bitter and quiet. &quot;Hopefully you won&#39;t feel 
compelled to kill Mamoru, our future King, 
Setsuna.&quot; Usagi wondered if the soul bond would
be enough.
  Setsuna&#39;s eyes flashed momentarily.
  &quot;Mamoru, she felt you deserved to be that 
candidate more than she, moreover, she probably 
still has no taste for rule. She gave you her 
power and her identity. You said &#39;she must 
live&#39;, Mamoru, and I agree on more levels 
than one. 
  Here things get interesting. 
  Technically the ginsuishou is the most 
powerful crystal, and was created to control the 
magical powers of all the planets sans Earth, by 
me. The central focal point of magic resides on 
the Moon, hence the &#39;Moon Kingdom&#39;. 
  The Earth&#39;s power is now controlled by you, 
Mamoru, through the kinsuishou. Celeste is a 
goddess and possesses more intrinsic power than 
you, Mamo-chan. 
  I believe Toro&#39;s realm may be able to be 
controlled by this &#39;All Powerful One&#39; and the 
kinsuishou. Toro&#39;s lackey, Dagon, and his ilk, 
have come in this time frame, because specific 
events they have waited for, have finally come 
together. 
  Possibly an alignment of the planets, or their 
dimension with ours, in conjunction with 
Celeste&#39;s transferal of her incredible powers to 
a weaker, more controllable, vessel... and they 
have also come coincidentally before my rise to 
power and the rebirth of the Silver Millennium. 
  We have two factions involved here, as well. 
Aradia and her allies who desire peace from what 
I can tell, and Dagon and his followers who seem 
to seek... something else. Dagon is no lover of 
humanity.
  I have seen Valka&#39;s power. He can create 
illusions so real with his magic, he can make 
you believe anything. Imagine the power to 
create something akin to the Elysian Fields or 
the chains of Tartarus. 
  What if they could seize control of the &#39;All 
powerful one&#39;, and with the power of illusion, 
convince him to use his power on Earth and in 
other dimensions as well... in accordance to 
their will. Humanity&#39;s very existence could be 
threatened, as well as the future Silver 
Millennium.  
  My mother said Queen Serenity was invoked by 
Gaea to create the Silver Millennium so there 
can be a peaceful union of magic and mundane. I 
believe I exist to carry on that plan. The new 
Silver Millennium could be dissolved easily by 
my destruction, or become vulnerable by your 
demise, Mamoru. 
  It could be, we can thwart Toro&#39;s whole 
objective by the return of Celeste&#39;s powers of 
Pluto through an incantation. This is both 
nebulous and problematic. Rei might be able 
to do the honors through the powers of Hecate 
she possesses. She has the potential to be a 
powerful Arch Mage in her own right, but it 
might take awhile for her to learn how. 
  Mamoru, this would mean you would no longer 
have Celeste&#39;s power to time travel and could 
not be used to control other worlds or 
dimensions. Then, too, maybe they don&#39;t need 
time travel to accomplish their deeds.
  I would give anything to find out what the 
original intent of those scrolls are. Setsuna, 
I would be grateful if you could find Celeste, 
Aradia, and that fellow she was seen with that 
Mako talked about... &quot; 
  &quot;Mikel.&quot; Mamoru supplied quietly. 
  Usagi nodded, &quot;Yes, Mikel, and resolve your 
differences. I want you to go on a mission 
together for me. Think of it as redemption, 
Setsuna-sama...
  I want you to locate, and bring to me, the 
Scrolls of Toro. Aradia should be able to 
interpret them. It could be the scrolls have 
been misinterpreted, and a negotiation could be 
hammered out to avoid a &#39;holy war&#39;... or, they 
could be the ramblings of a mad man.&quot; 
  Mamoru spoke up then, &quot;I would like to go, 
too, Princess.&quot;
  Usagi closed her eyes tiredly, &quot;Mamo-chan, 
that would be like tying a steak around your 
neck and letting you go play with a pack of 
hungry wolves. The answer is... no, because I 
love you.
  I really must rest now, ok? So, why don&#39;t you 
two go get some supper together somewhere and 
discuss... terms of therapy!&quot; 
  Setsuna and Mamoru blushed, stood and bowed to 
their future queen to take their leave.
  Mamoru bent and kissed Usagi and whispered to 
her, &quot;You are so noble. If Rei agrees to restore 
to us our soul bond, I won&#39;t stand in the way of 
your bond to her, my love. Get well soon.&quot; He 
smiled charmingly and winked. 
  She watched him slip her ring into his pocket, 
take Setsuna&#39;s hand, and leave her room.

                   * * *
  Usagi rolled over onto her knotted sore 
stomach and coughed painfully into her pillow. 
With all her resolve spent to keep her emotions 
in check, she let her tears flow.
  Mamoru and Setsuna bid Mrs. Tsukino and Rei 
goodbye, who were in the kitchen busily cooking. 
Ikuko was determined to make a cook out of Rei, 
&#39;for her own good&#39;. 
  Rei gave Ikuko puppy dog eyes, and Ikuko 
laughed. 
  &quot;I know you hate this, and you want to go to 
her! Go ahead, you bum, shoo!&quot;
  Rei ran. She had known the moment Usagi had 
been released from the matrimonial bond. It was 
as though the last barrier between their souls 
had dropped. And right now, she could feel Usagi 
as she fell apart. It had taken all her strength 
and courage to break up with Mamoru. She 
couldn&#39;t be brave anymore.
  Usagi rolled onto her back and reached for Rei 
as she closed the room door and swooped into the 
outstretched arms. Usagi knew she would come. 
They held each other and cried for a while. 
  Usagi shook terribly. 
  &quot;Oh, Rei, what have I done? I&#39;m scared I&#39;ve  
done the wrong thing!&quot;
  Rei suddenly felt fearful. 
  &quot;Do you have some regrets? You&#39;re not sure you 
want to go through with... us? Do you want me to 
leave and give you some space?&quot; Rei&#39;s heart was 
breaking.
  Usagi froze. She felt Rei&#39;s pain pierce 
through her own heart. She gasped, and clutched 
her chest. 
  &quot;Ohh... Rei, that hurts! I didn&#39;t mean to 
cause you pain! I want you with all my heart. 
Please don&#39;t leave me, I need you more than ever 
right now.&quot;
  Usagi still trembled uncontrollably as Rei 
held and rocked her. She cried and coughed while 
she hiccupped over her words... 
  &quot;It&#39;s over. It&#39;s really over, after all these 
years. There&#39;s no more soul bond to him... and 
it hurts so much... I hurt! And I&#39;m so... 
afraid.&quot; Usagi sobbed.
  Rei wished she were better at this sort of 
thing... 
  &quot;I know it hurts, Angel, and I am here for 
you. I will take care of you, and I promise 
everything will be all right. I love you.&quot; 
  Rei soothed, while she tried desperately to 
calm the feverish girl down. Usagi was too sick 
to be upset like this and felt very hot to Rei.
  Usagi blinked at Rei desperately, then 
clambered quickly to her feet. She clamped her 
hand over her mouth, and ran for the bathroom.
  Rei rushed after her and kicked the bathroom 
door shut on the way in. 
  Usagi&#39;s whole body trembled as she sat quickly 
and lost all her fluids at once. Rei felt 
completely helpless, as her friend was sick on 
herself and the floor. 
  Rei caught Usagi as she fainted. 
  Rei peeled Usagi&#39;s wet nightgown off, gently 
put her into the bathtub, and turned the water 
on to warm it. She sighed while she flushed the 
toilet then turned her attention to floor. Rei 
cleaned everything up, then shucked her own 
clothes. 
  After she washed, rinsed, and hung all 
the clothes, Rei climbed into the tub and used 
the detachable showerhead to wash herself up. 
Then she used it to wet Usagi&#39;s hair and thin 
body. 
  Tears pricked her eyes. 
  &quot;Please get well, Usa, you are wasting away... 
and I need you.&quot; She pled the now semi conscious 
girl.
  Usagi moaned and shivered. 
  &quot;Ooh, that&#39;s cold!!&quot; 
  &quot;No, it isn&#39;t, your temperature has spiked up 
again. I don&#39;t want anyone else coming over to 
upset you. Period. You were recovering so well. 
Hopefully this is just a temporary setback.&quot; Rei 
replied gruffly.
  Rei rinsed the soap and shampoo off her friend 
and turned the water off. Rei dried herself off 
and found what looked to be Shingo&#39;s housecoat 
behind the door on a hook and put it on. She 
dried Usagi&#39;s hair and body and finished with 
her senshi powers. 
  Usagi shivered hard, and Rei wrapped her 
friend in a large thick towel. Rei carried her 
half-conscious back to the room. Kami, she was 
light. 
  Ikuko met them outside the room and stared in 
amusement at Rei&#39;s &#39;Looney Tunes&#39; housecoat. 
  &quot;What happened? Is she all right?&quot; 
  Rei laid Usagi down on her bed, and addressed 
her worried mother. 
  &quot;She&#39;s had a little accident. She&#39;ll probably 
be fine after she eats a bite and rests. I may 
not have cleaned the bathroom to your 
satisfaction, though, you might want to do a 
better job while I help her dress.&quot; 
  Ikuko squeezed Rei&#39;s arm. The girl was clearly 
shaken. 
  &quot;These things happen, it&#39;s all right, Rei. 
She&#39;s probably swallowed too much phlegm. We&#39;ll 
need to get some nourishment into her soon, 
since she&#39;s fainting. 
  While Kenji and I have lived in fear of 
stomach viruses, doctors have only assured us 
over the years, that Usagi is not diabetic. She 
does, however, have an abnormally high 
metabolism. 
  I am supposed to make sure she gets a balanced 
diet with a lot of the right kinds of food... 
one that has plenty of proteins and vitamins. 
Ikuko frowned, &quot;I think that&#39;s their lame, very 
pat way to say they are stumped... at any rate, 
Kenji and I refused to let them use our daughter 
as a lab rat!&quot; 
  Ikuko left to take care of what turned out to 
be the hallway and laundry in the bathroom. Then 
went downstairs to find something nourishing 
that Usagi could keep down.
  Rei occupied herself in the meantime with the  
difficult task of helping a very languid 
companion dress. Mission accomplished, Rei 
soothed, &quot;Hang in there, Baby, food is on its 
way.&quot; 
  Usagi replied weakly, &quot;I&#39;m trying to, Rei, 
I... I need energy.&quot; She laid her head wearily
upon Rei&#39;s breast, and listened to Rei&#39;s steady 
heartbeat. Her fingers curled around Rei&#39;s robe 
lapel and she closed her eyes. Usagi could feel 
Rei&#39;s warm energy surge into her body.
  Rei gave Usagi her own energy until her color 
improved.
  &quot;Thank you.&quot; Usagi whispered, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m 
so much trouble.&quot; Her eyes watered, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I 
threw up on you, and scared you.&quot; 
  Usagi&#39;s chin was tilted up, then she felt 
warm, soft, familiar lips kiss the wetness from 
her cheeks. She began to relax when she felt 
Rei&#39;s comfort surround her.
  Rei whispered back. 
  &quot;Shhhh... hush, it&#39;s all right, there&#39;s no 
harm done. Besides, turn-about is fair play, 
ne?&quot; Rei reminded her princess. 
  Then she mused, &quot;If an abnormal &#39;metabolism&#39; 
is the worst thing that can happen to us, I 
think we&#39;re pretty fortunate. If the doctors 
ever saw your sigil, they&#39;d have a field day on 
you, my little lab rat!&quot; She chuckled, then 
leaned in to kiss Usagi&#39;s hot forehead to make 
her point. 
  She spoke again softly, &quot;I want you to know, 
Usa, you aren&#39;t any trouble at all... I wouldn&#39;t 
be here if I didn&#39;t want to take care of you, 
precious.&quot; 
  Rei squeezed her friend, &quot;I think your 
weaknesses are part of your charm, and they keep 
you humble.&quot; 
  Rei smiled affectionately, &quot;Otherwise, you&#39;d 
be insufferable, my sweet!&quot; 
  Usagi smiled back shyly.
  Ikuko announced herself as she pushed the door 
open with her foot, because her hands were full. 
  Usagi&#39;s eyes lit up like a Christmas tree and 
gushed, &quot;Oh glorious food! Come to me succulent 
feast!&quot; Her faced soured a little when she 
espied her medicine on the tray, as well.
  Ikuko&#39;s face soured when she espied the lack 
of Mamoru&#39;s engagement ring on her daughter&#39;s 
left ring finger. So.
  When she had an opportunity to be alone with 
Usagi, Ikuko pried her daughter about it. Ikuko 
was given the &#39;Dr. Wakai&#39; version of the 
deterioration of the relationship. 
  Ikuko couldn&#39;t help but feel a small twinge of 
disappointment when she discovered Usagi was not 
pregnant. She determined in her heart that it 
would be best if Kenji not know about Mamoru&#39;s 
behavior towards his daughter. She also decided 
that the girls should be the ones to share the 
true nature of their relationship with whomever 
they wanted to.
  Why the two girls had bonded, though, was now 
clearly understandable.
