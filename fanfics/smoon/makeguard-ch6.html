Two sets of soft footsteps were the only sounds in the now deserted 
corridor of the Palace of the Moon. Shingo walked swiftly by the side of 
a female Jovian warrior They were just returning from their assigned 
task The soft light from small arched windows illuminated there path in 
the dark hall. Every other living soul was at the ball celebrating. It 
had taken a little less than a candle mark to deliver all the gifts to 
each princess&#39;s chamber. They were supposed to be delivered while the 
princesses were at the ball so that they might open them afterwards when 
they returned to their rooms. The night had swiftly bore down upon them. 
All of the crew, having donned their attire for the ball, left quite 
awhile ago. He, the princess, and the lady warrior he walked with were 
going to be terribly late and he knew it.

The princess had helped them unload all the gifts and dispose of the 
Chimera. When they&#39;d arrived, Makoto went to explain to the palace guard 
the circumstances of their late arrival and the crate they carried 
aboard. She ordered the rest of the crew off to the ball with a message 
and apology to be delivered to the queen and princess. She would 
apologize personally later. The immediate concern was getting rid of 
their unexpected extra cargo, which had been done without question. Many 
of the guests were on their way to the ball at that time, which 
confirmed their suspicions as to how late they really were. Some of them 
had stopped to stare at the antique of a ship that now occupied the 
harbor. Many tried to catch a glimpse of the rustic crew and their 
princess, though they had already departed to ready themselves for the 
ball. The palace guard took care of any loose ends, telling her she 
should take her leave, for they knew she needed to be at the ball.

Shingo was halted in front of a pair of large white double doors. The 
doors bore the sign of Jupiter engraved into their center. The lady 
warrior stepped forward and knocked twice on the thick wood. A muffled 
reply was all they got, at least to Shingo&#39;s ears. The woman beside him 
must have understood, for she pushed the door open and entered ahead of 
him. Padding in behind her, he took in the surroundings. It was clear 
for whom it was intended to accommodate. Almost everything in the room 
had Jupiter&#39;s royal colors on it. It was one of the most amazing rooms 
he had ever seen. His eyes were wide as he noted the large bed, with 
emerald green sheets that matched the carpeted floor and even the 
curtains. The ceiling was a huge dome, much like the one back home in 
the garden had been, except it that it was closed and made totally of 
glass and iron. The windows that lined the far wall stretched from the 
ceiling to the floor. From what he could tell through the partially 
closed curtains, they looked like they led onto a balcony of some sort . 
The walls were adorned with tapestries and various ornaments that 
reflected that of Jovian styles. Two in particular caught his eye and he 
leaned forward a bit trying to get a better look. There were two swords 
mounted on the far right wall that might serve more as decoration than 
anything. They were of different sizes, with one being larger and more 
plain, while the other was smaller and a bit more ornamented.

Someone spoke, pulling his attention away from the swords. &quot;This has got 
to be one of the most useful books I&#39;ve read lately,&quot; Makoto walked into 
the large room, carrying an extremely thick book in her left hand and 
something small and shiny in her right. She&#39;d come from a door that must 
lead to a wash room. &quot;Though I don&#39;t read much to begin with, so that 
shouldn&#39;t be a real surprise.&quot; She walked purposefully toward a round 
table set in the corner. On the table were many gifts from the other 
princesses. Many opened gifts he noted.

&quot;Highness,&quot; the woman beside him smiled, &quot;you weren&#39;t supposed to open 
those yet.&quot;

&quot;Whose to know if I open them now or later? Besides, one of them has 
proved very useful to me.&quot; Sitting the book on the table, she pulled the 
sleeve of her shirt up revealing a long gash in her arm. One that was 
now held together by rather uneven stitches. &quot;It&#39;s a book of medicine. 
Tells ya about lots of cures to different illnesses. Also had quite a 
bit about treating open wounds and preventing infection. Useful stuff.&quot;

&quot;Um, princess, don&#39;t tell me you&#150;&quot;

&quot;Did it myself,&quot; Makoto finished for her, holding up the needle with her 
right hand. She then pulled a cloth from her back pocket and began to 
wrap it around the injury.

Shingo looked at her in disbelief. He&#39;d forgotten that the Chimera had 
managed to wound Makoto during their fight. She&#39;d said nothing about it 
afterwards, so he figured it must be nothing. After seeing the injury, 
however, he knew she should probably see a healer soon after the ball.

&quot;And don&#39;t start with me Boarder. I&#39;ll see a healer after the ball,&quot; 
Makoto said, then used her teeth to tie the cloth in a knot, securing it 
on her arm.

Shingo smiled, as her words echoed his thoughts.

The lady warrior, Boarder, laughed lightly and walked over to the 
princess. She stopped at the table and looked down at the much praised 
book. &quot;Medical Treatment for Various Maladies and Mishaps,&quot; she read 
aloud. &quot;So, who&#39;s this one from?&quot;

Makoto picked up a small blue card and handed it to Boarder.

&quot;The princess of Mercury is it? She has quite a long name now doesn&#39;t 
she?&quot; the woman noted, reading the full name at the beginning of the 
card silently to herself. &quot;Oh, seems you won&#39;t have to use it though. 
She&#39;s added an abbreviation she prefers to be addressed by. Ami is short 
enough, a bit of a strange name.&quot; Putting the card down, she scanned 
over the other presents. &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; she picked up a small yellow 
bag.

&quot;No idea,&quot; Makoto answered, taking the bag in her own hands, &quot;But I 
don&#39;t intend to find out until I ask the Princess of Venus.&quot; Opening the 
bag, she let Boarder look inside. &quot;It&#39;s some sorta powdery gold ash or 
something.&quot; She tied the bag again.

&quot;Weird,&quot; the other woman replied. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s a medical herb of some 
kind? These people must think you get yourself banged up a lot,&quot; she 
laughed.

&quot;Well, this other one definitely isn&#39;t for healing purposes. It&#39;s pretty 
nice. Though I&#39;ve never had a knack for archery.&quot; Makoto held up a long 
wooden war bow. It was a very fine weapon, dyed green with carvings of 
oak leaves running up and down its length. She had yet to string it, but 
knew that it would not disappoint. &quot;I&#39;ll have to start practicing I 
guess,&quot; she set it back on the table.

&quot;And that was from the war goddess?&quot; Boarder asked.

&quot;Ha!&quot; Makoto barked. &quot;I&#39;d bet my right eye that she&#39;s never been in a 
real battle, let alone a war. Probably soft, like the rest of them.&quot;

Boarder frowned for a moment. &quot;Strength isn&#39;t everything Highness, they 
may posses some very useful skills.&quot;

&quot;I wonder if you&#39;re right. However, they&#39;ve been kept under a secure 
guard for so long. None of them have even been able to fight, and beside 
that, nothing massive enough has ever gotten through the outer defenses 
to provide much of a challenge. I see to that as well.&quot;

&quot;Not everything is solved in battle Highness...&quot;

Makoto turned to say something back, but Shingo stopped her. &quot;Milady! 
Why are you not dressed for the ball yet?&quot;

Both women turned to the boy. In their debate, they&#39;d forgotten he was 
there. Boarder looked back to Makoto, noticing that she still wore her 
loose shirt and rough pants. She and the boy were already dressed for 
the ball; they had done so before delivering the gifts. Boarder&#39;s face 
took on a slightly panicked look.

&quot;How can you not be dressed! You&#39;re going to be ridiculously late if you 
don&#39;t hurry.&quot; She started making a shooing motion with her hands, 
directing Makoto to the other side of the room.

Makoto made her own shooing motion towards Boarder, and sped off to the 
wash room. &quot;Alright already! My clothes are in here, and I&#39;ve got em all 
laid out so I can just throw em on. We&#39;re already late. Being a little 
later won&#39;t matter now anyway.&quot;

Boarder rolled her eyes and waved her hand in the air in front of her in 
an exasperated motion. &quot;That&#39;s not the point! You don&#39;t just throw 
clothes on for a ball. It takes time to prepare yourself to look decent. 
Put a little thought into it and you&#39;ll look great.&quot; She, herself, was 
wearing a long shimmering green dress that showed her perfect figure 
nicely. Boarder was one of the most beautiful women in the princess&#39;s 
army, and one of the best warriors. She knew this, and liked to show it 
off as much as she could. And it wasn&#39;t every day that she was able to 
attend such a formal event. She knew the princess hated these kinds of 
things, but she should still look her best. Boarder could only wonder 
how the princess was going to react when she informed her that it was to 
be a masquerade as well.

A few moments later, Makoto emerged from the wash room. &quot;Alright then, I 
await your inspection. It&#39;s been a really long time since I&#39;ve worn 
anything like this.&quot; Shingo and Boarder turned to appraise their 
princess. When they saw her they were slightly shocked. Makoto wore a 
long dark green jacket lined in black, with a white vest underneath. 
They fit her tall lithe figure perfectly, from her white pants to the 
tall black leather boots she wore. Her cape was thrown over her left 
shoulder and the top few buttons of her shirt were left undone. She, in 
all honesty, looked like the royalty she was. There was only one problem 
in Boarder&#39;s opinion.

&quot;Your highness,&quot; she gulped slightly, &quot;were you intending on taking on 
the appearance of a...er..handsome...male?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;Well, you see, when you put on the mask no one will see your face and 
well...&quot;

&quot;Mask? What mask? Why would I wear a mask?&quot;

&quot;See that&#39;s the thing. I heard just a short while ago that the ball was 
recently changed to a masquerade ball. It was the Princess&#39;s wish that 
it be done.&quot;

Makoto just stood there looking at her like she&#39;d grown another head. 
Moving to sit in a chair by the table she asked, &quot;And where am I 
supposed to get a mask? I wasn&#39;t prepared for this at all.&quot; Her eyes lit 
up for a moment. &quot;Hey, since I don&#39;t have one, why should I go? Nobody 
told me about it, so it&#39;s not my fault.&quot;

Boarder shook her head, and Shingo stepped around her, handing Makoto 
two masks. &quot;Sorry, they already thought of that one. Seems like you&#39;re 
going weather you like it or not.&quot;

&quot;Damn.&quot; Makoto took the masks from Shingo. One was a black, half face 
mask trimmed in green with the symbol of Jupiter on the forehead. It was 
covered in a thin layer of metal with delicate gold etchings of oak 
leaves scattered across its surface. It would hide most of her features, 
all but her mouth. The other was a small, dark green mask of a more 
plain design that would cover only her eyes. It also bore the sign of 
Jupiter, but much smaller. If she picked that one, she&#39;d do better to 
not even bother wearing one at all. It&#39;s not like anyone would recognize 
her anyway. She thought on this, then, suddenly, an idea hit her. She 
could get through this thing with little trouble at all. Boarder had 
said that she&#39;d look like a man if no one could see her face. She set 
the green mask down and put the black one on, fastening it securely so 
it wouldn&#39;t fall off. Getting up from her seat, she went to a full 
length mirror that stood against the wall near the wash room. When she 
peered into it, she hardly recognized herself. Grinning, Makoto looked 
over at Boarder and Shingo.

&quot;Boarder, you look like royalty tonight.&quot; Boarder blushed in response 
and looked at the floor.

&quot;Kind of like...a princess. You could pass for one any day I bet.&quot;

Boarder jerked her head up to meet Makoto&#39;s eyes. &quot;Highness, I am not 
going to pose as you tonight,&quot; she said with firm resolve.

Makoto was unfazed by her response &quot;Oh come on. No one is gonna know 
till afterward anyway. I don&#39;t know any of these people, and I don&#39;t 
want them flocking around me. It&#39;s not like we&#39;d be breaking any rules. 
Hell, this might turn out to be kinda fun. I know how much you love the 
attention, and you don&#39;t even have to pretend, just leave it to their 
imagination. They&#39;ll just assume that you&#39;re me.&quot;

Boarder looked at the floor, unsure of how to respond. Sure, she did 
like attention and it seemed like an innocent enough plan. What was she 
to question her princess anyway. Makoto could very well order her to do 
it if she so chose. Boarder sighed and answered, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t plan on 
being ignored though, Highness. You might just get more attention than 
you bargained for.&quot;

Makoto was pulling her hair back at the nape of her neck and tying it 
with a green ribbon. &quot;Oh, I&#39;ll just blend into the crowd...maybe find a 
wall to lean on, or a cushion or something. I&#39;m not obligated to mingle. 
You&#39;ll be doing enough of that for the both of us.&quot; Makoto then smiled 
over at Shingo, &quot;And you can do what you want. Don&#39;t worry about 
anything, Shingo. Stick by me if you like. You might even wanna check 
out the food. I know I will.&quot;

Shingo smiled back in reply.

Makoto pulled at her open collar. &quot;This thing is hot, let&#39;s hurry up and 
get to the ball so we can get back., I&#39;m not feeling so great tonight.&quot;

Boarder looked at her, worried. &quot;Are you alright? Do you need 
something?&quot;

&quot;Na, I&#39;m fine, I&#39;m fine. Just a little warm is all.&quot; Makoto started for 
the door, stopping long enough to remove the large sword, that Shingo 
had been examining earlier, from the wall. Strapping it to her side, she 
was on her way. &quot;Well, come on or it&#39;ll be over by the time we get 
there. Not that it&#39;d be a bad thing...&quot;

It was a long stroll down the corridors to the grand hall where the ball 
was being held. As they approached the noise grew louder. There were 
sounds of laughter, music, and the steady banter between guests. When 
they reached the entry way Makoto peered in and was surprised by how 
large the room was. It was at least three times bigger than her own 
grand hall back at the Castle of Jupiter. There were hundreds of guests 
everywhere. Some were dancing or lounging, and others were clustered in 
groups conversing in many different languages. The variety of people 
attending the event was also amazing. Their clothing colors varied 
depending on the planet they were representing. Looking around, Makoto 
could only spot a few hints of green here and there. Her people were 
pretty well spread out among the guests.

She felt someone poke her in the side and heard a throat being cleared. 
Turning, she saw an impatient Boarder motioning for her to go in. 
Looking once more into the crowded room, she stepped aside and extended 
her arm, indicating to the other woman that she should go ahead. &quot;Ladies 
first after all...&quot;

Boarder rolled her eyes and walked ahead of them as they entered the 
massive room. Walking a little to the right, Makoto scanned the crowd, 
noticing all the differences she was seeing in the people there. They 
all had a myriad of hair colors and heights that differed greatly from 
Jovians. Many of them had turned to see who the newcomers were and 
conversation broke out anew among the groups that were nearer to them. 
Makoto spotted the raised dias on the far side of the room and pointed 
it out to Boarder, who nodded. Going to the queen and apologizing was 
her first priority, so they headed for the throne. Upon reaching it, 
Makoto stood next to Boarder in front of the queen and both of them 
bowed in unison. Makoto doubted that Queen Serenity would remember what 
she looked like, even if she weren&#39;t wearing a mask, but she wasn&#39;t 
going to take the chance in letting her charade fail by making it 
obvious who she was. So she did everything equally as Boarder did. When 
they apologized, she made sure to be as vague as possible, as did 
Boarder. The beautiful woman sitting upon the throne and smiling, 
notified them that the apology was not necessary at the moment and she 
would accept further details later. For now she wanted them to relax and 
enjoy themselves.

&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;

&quot;I do hope you will derive some pleasure from the celebration this 
night. It has been a long time since so many Jovians have attended a 
ball at the Palace.&quot; The Queen looked out over the crowd as she 
addressed them. &quot;And it has been a very long time, Princess Makoto, 
since you have graced our hall.&quot; Getting no direct response from either 
of them, she smiled. &quot;Well, I have kept you long enough. Please, go have 
fun and get to know some of the other guests.&quot; She watched them take 
there leave, noticing the sword hanging from the hip of the taller of 
the two. Her smile grew bigger as she thought back to a ball that took 
place many years ago. Back to another tall rogue who had the same 
bearing and height. One who would have tried the same sort of trick his 
daughter was now. &quot;I can already tell...she is very much like her 
father.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me my Queen? Did you say something?&quot; a voice, close by, startled 
her. The voice belonged to that of Prince Endymion of Earth. He had a 
questioning look on his face.

&quot;Oh nothing, I was just talking to myself,&quot; she answered.

&quot;Well, my Queen, there is no need for that. As you can see, there are 
plenty of people to talk to.&quot; He laughed lightly waving a hand towards 
the crowd. &quot;One in particular that I am looking for at the moment.&quot; He 
scratched the back of his head.

&quot;Has my daughter gotten herself lost in the crowd again? You should 
really tie a string to her or something Endymion.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;m don&#39;t think there is a need for such extremes. You see I 
already have a string tied to her, as it is to me.&quot; He looked out over 
the crowd. &quot;One that tugs on my heart day after day. It will always lead 
me back to her.&quot;

&quot;I do hope so, Endymion. You are such a romantic and you spoil her so. 
But I could think of none better to love my daughter.&quot;

Still scanning the crowd for the younger Serenity, he finally spotted 
her. &quot;Ha! There she is...over by the food. Why didn&#39;t I think to look 
there first?&quot;

The Queen shook her head and laughed. Endymion bowed slightly toward her 
and fairly leapt from the dias in his haste to catch the princess.

&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;

Taking the sign of dismissal, the two dispersed. Makoto&#39;s mind was not 
at ease as she left the dias. She still wondered if the Queen realized 
which one she was. The woman hadn&#39;t exactly spoken to one of them 
directly. It was more like she looked off into the distance as she 
talked. Like she either wasn&#39;t sure whom to speak to or she didn&#39;t 
really mind either way. Sighing heavily, she wanted to find a place to 
sit down. Spotting some invitingly soft cushions near a pillar, she made 
her way towards them, telling Boarder to mingle or whatever it was she 
did at these things. On the way over to them, she noticed that there 
were a lot of people staring at her, and it was beginning to make her 
feel uneasy. She hastened her steps past a group of lounging women who 
seemed to be arguing about something while stealing glances at her now 
and then. When she was past them she slowed her steps and looked back 
over her shoulder at the group. A woman with long blond hair was arguing 
with a raven haired woman who seemed to be ignoring her. The other girl 
was ignoring both of them.. Her delicate face was framed by feathery 
blue hair, and she was following someone with her gaze.

&#39;Blue?&#39; Makoto raised one eyebrow, intrigued, &#39;That&#39;s...unique. I wonder 
if it&#39;s naturally that color. Amazing.&#39; She had completely stopped now 
as she stared at the group. Her mind was contemplating whether she 
should go over to them so that she could get a closer look at the girl&#39;s 
hair. Just then the dark haired one was finally acknowledging the 
blond&#39;s existence and said something to her. The blonde turned on her 
cushion to look over in Makoto&#39;s direction. She smiled largely and 
winked, then turned back to the other girl to say something. Meanwhile 
the girl she addressed looked over the blonde&#39;s shoulder at Makoto and 
made a strange expression and then shook her head at the blond. The girl 
then smiled and pointed at Makoto, even as she felt herself being 
physically pulled backwards. Whoever had grabbed her, spun her around 
very quickly, pulling her towards the dancers.

&#39;What the hell?&#39; Makoto thought as she was almost dragged along by an 
aqua haired woman. &quot;Hey!&quot; she said, angry. They stopped, suddenly, in 
the middle of the dancing couples. &quot;What&#39;s the idea? I was going to sit 
down and you just grab me! You got any idea who I&#150; &quot; She stopped 
herself, realizing she was about to give her identity away already. The 
aqua haired woman turned to her, smiling. Even with the mask, anyone 
could tell she was an enchantingly beautiful woman. As her perfect lips 
were opening to speak, Makoto was trying to flee from the floor. The 
smile disappeared as the woman grabbed her arm again. This time she got 
Makoto&#39;s wounded one, and holding in a hiss of pain, Makoto conceded to 
the shorter woman.

&quot;Hey yourself.&quot; she laughed at Makoto.

&quot;You must be one of the most handsome and imposing figures here, and 
you&#39;re trying to get through by lounging on a bunch of cushions? Come 
on, that would be a waste now, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot; she arched an eyebrow 
seductively as she looked over Makoto&#39;s shoulder. Makoto tried to turn 
and see what the woman was looking at, but she was pulled closer.

&quot;Now if you&#39;ll be so kind as to lead.&quot; They began dancing and having a 
rather one sided conversation as well.

They danced this way for a while. Many other potential partners were 
becoming impatient with the woman for monopolizing the striking Jovian. 
They all wanted to have a turn with such an exquisite dancer.

The woman was talking again after a short time of silence between them. 
&quot;I didn&#39;t know that Jovians were such good dancers.&quot;

Makoto looked down at her. &quot;Not all of us are really...my mother taught 
me to dance. She was most likely the best dancer in the universe.&quot;

&quot;So, you really can talk.&quot; she smiled. &quot;I also didn&#39;t realize Jovian&#39;s 
were so tall. I know another who is a little taller than you,&quot; she 
tightened her eyebrows in a frown. &quot;Though she&#39;s not a Jovian, and not 
nearly as...reserved.&quot; her jaw tensed a little. Makoto just continued to 
lead the dance, uncaring. The woman looked over Makoto&#39;s shoulder again. 
As the music they were dancing to came to an end, the woman released 
her. Makoto brought a hand up to pull on her open collar. She was 
feeling over heated again and a bit dizzy for some reason.

&quot;Who is it that you keep looking for?&quot; Makoto asked, letting her eyes 
drift over the faces of the other dancers. The woman tensed slightly 
and, noticing Makoto&#39;s signs of discomfort, took her arm again and led 
her towards one of the open archways on the side of the hall. It led out 
onto a long balcony that stretched the length of the entire hall.

&quot;It&#39;s cooler out here.&quot; she stated, moving to the railing. Makoto 
followed her, curiously.

&quot;You&#39;re right, it is.&quot; There were other people out here, so it was not 
completely secluded. But it offered slight privacy from the hectic room 
they had come from. Leaning against the railing, Makoto let her head 
roll back and breathed in the night air.

&quot;I must admit that I&#39;m using you.&quot; the woman laughed lightly. &quot;You&#39;ve 
helped me out before you know?&quot; Makoto looked at the her in confusion.

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m surprised you don&#39;t remember. As you don&#39;t receive many visitors in 
your castle, do you?&quot;

Makoto looked closely at the woman, taking in her long aqua hair and 
porcelain like skin. She did look slightly fragile in some ways, but 
there was something mysterious about her. Then she finally met her eyes 
and knew who it was. &quot;You!&quot;

The woman laughed. &quot;Yep. It&#39;s me. Took you long enough didn&#39;t it.&quot;

&quot;The wayward artist. Michiru was your name wasn&#39;t it? I thought I was 
rid of you...&quot;

Michiru answered her with much sarcasm. &quot;You actually remembered my 
name. I&#39;m so flattered.&quot; Her voice returned to normal as she continued. 
&quot;Yes, you were glad for me to be gone weren&#39;t you. I did complete the 
sculpture by the way. It turned out as perfect as the model.&quot;

Makoto let out a small &#39;Hmph&#39; noise.

&quot;I just couldn&#39;t help it, Makoto. It&#39;s too easy to get you flustered. 
And you did help me out that time, weather you like it or not. That 
little hiatus on Ganymede probably saved me from making one of the 
biggest mistakes of my life. Now I&#39;ve just been trying to keep it all in 
line. And I&#39;m having a grand time at that to. You should really find 
something to keep you in line.&quot;

&quot;I keep everything in line just fine thank you. That&#39;s what I do. What 
are you doing here anyway? I let you stay at my castle for the purpose 
of your inspiration or whatever. You got to do your sculpture. You&#39;re 
not here for inspiration are you?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;ve got all that I can handle now.&quot; she smiled and looked to her 
right. &quot;And now, as I said, you are going to help me again.&quot; As Makoto 
was turning, yet again, to try and catch a glimpse of whoever it was 
Michiru was looking at, the other woman was coming towards her. Just as 
she managed to see a tall figure striding quickly in there direction, 
she was pulled down to the other woman. When the pair of warm lips 
touched hers she was, to say the least, very confused. Michiru kissed 
her softly, not deepening the contact any futher. Makoto didn&#39;t know 
what to do, so she just stood there over her, letting Michiru take 
control of her own lips. She was frozen and didn&#39;t know how to 
react...no one had ever done this to her before. Makoto was just 
starting to panic when someone roughly pulled her from the other woman&#39;s 
grasp. She was spun around to face a very angry looking young man, with 
sandy hair and piercing eyes.

&quot;And what do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot; he questioned in a flat and deadly 
voice.

&quot;I think I&#39;m wishing I was back home and away from you looney people.&quot; 
she answered equally angered.

The man let go of his hold on her and spoke again, &quot;I don&#39;t know who you 
are, but I doubt any of this is your problem at the moment,&quot; he glanced 
at Michiru, who was smiling triumphantly. &quot;I would like you to leave us 
for a bit. There&#39;s something I need to clear up.&quot; He pushed a book into 
Makoto&#39;s hands and gave her a nudge toward the archway. Makoto, being 
too dizzy and confused to argue, went on her way. As she walked she 
looked down at the book she was holding, &#39;Why would anyone be reading a 
book at a ball?&#39; she wondered, once again entering the crowded room, 
only to be barraged by perspective dance partners. Sighing, she accepted 
the inevitable, regretting her disguise. &#39;I can understand exactly why 
someone would be reading a book, and I&#39;d have to say...they&#39;re a 
genius.&#39;</pre>
