<h1>Dreams Can Lie (part 10 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dreamlie-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>- What a beautiful room&#133;such a gorgeous gown I&#146;m wearing. A veil? I 
must be getting married. Is that Rei? No&#133;the hair color is different. 
Wait&#133;&#133;NO! I won&#146;t marry anyone but Rei!- She was thrashing around in 
bed. The blue-haired genius couldn&#146;t get a hold on her.

&#147; For the love of God, Terri wake up!&#148; Terri stopped her thrashing and 
her eyes and woke up. Grabbing on to the other women desperately. 

&#147; Terri? Dragon what&#146;s wrong?&#148; Ami cradled the other woman. 

&#147; Ami, I had the worst dream! Well more like nightmare, I was getting 
married.&#148;

&#147; That&#146;s not bad...&#148;

&#147; It wasn&#146;t Rei, someone I couldn&#146;t see.&#148; 

&#147; Oh. I can see why it was a nightmare. Well snap on some clothes. I&#146;m 
carrying you to the Palace Training room. You can tell me about the 
nightmare on the way there.&#148;

&#147; Ami, I&#146;m all sweaty! I gotta take a nice warm shower first!&#148;

&#147; How? U can&#146;t walk.&#148;

&#147; Oh Ami, I can wa&#133;&#148; Scratch that she can&#146;t. Ami sighed.

&#147; You were saying. I&#146;ll carry you into your bathroom, I&#146;m sure you can 
use your energy to help take a shower.&#148;

&#147; Then why carry me if I can teleport?&#148;

&#147; For safety. We don&#146;t even know what happened to you yet. Less energy 
you use the better. Come on.&#148; Ami picked Planet Queen up and carried 
her to the evergreen bathroom connected to the room. Ten minutes 
later, Terri floated out in black work out pants and a black tank top, 
her hair in a high ponytail. Ami picked her up from where she had 
dropped on the floor. Then they were on their way to the training 
room. 

&#147; Any idea how that energy was taken from you?&#148;

&#147; I think so. It was the Kyphon&#146;s master. She wanted to make me weaker 
so her junky could bring me to her. But I&#146;m not exactly sure, the 
energy patterns were weird.&#148; Ami arched an eyebrow.

&#147; She?&#148;

&#147; Yes, a woman. I might know who were dealing with. It seems so 
familiar. The final battle is soon.&#148;

&#147; Who says your gonna fight? You can&#146;t even walk.&#148; Terri grinned as 
they entered the pure white room. 

&#147; I believe I can fix that. Hold me up please. With energy, so u don&#146;t 
get hurt if something goes wrong.&#148; Ami frowned at this but did as 
ordered. Terri called out her stone and transformed. Letting the 
familiar warmth of magic flow over her. She nodded to Ami, who let her 
go so she could jump a few times. 

&#147; Cool, it worked. All better.&#148; Ami looked doubtful and pulled out her 
mini-computer and checked.

&#147; Amazing, Complete recovery. How?&#148;

&#147; Don&#146;t know. I have this weird feeling it happened before.&#148; Ami 
nodded and walked over to her. Terrestria detransformed and snapped 
her fingers to switch her clothing as Ami did the same. 

&#147; Ok. Let&#146;s go eat with the others.&#148; Terri nodded and they left.

Serenity looked up from her lunch and grinned.

&#147; Terrestria! I&#146;m glad you can join us! Feeling better?&#148; Terrestria 
smiled.

&#147; Complete recovery. Plus, my Doctor says I can fight in the next 
battle.&#148; Ami paused.

&#147; I never said&#133;never mind&#133;losing battle. Lets eat.&#148; the others giggled 
as the two Queens sat down.

No sooner had the royals finished lunch did the alarm go off. The 
Senshi transformed and teleported to the park. Again.

There they met up with a large Multicolored kyphon. It grinned 
wickedly and jumped into a large black portal.

&#147; Well, should we follow Moon?&#148; Terrestrial looked towards the blonde. 
Moon nodded.

&#147; Alright. Let&#146;s go!&#148; They followed, running for five minutes until 
they came to three tunnels.

&#147; Alright, Inners &amp; Endymion take #3. Outers we&#146;ll take #1. I&#146;m 
guessing they end up at the end up at the same place.&#148; Everyone nodded 
and went to their tunnel. No one noticed Endymion trace back and go 
through #2.A small smile on his face.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~************~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&#147; Terrestrial when do you think this tunnel will end? We&#146;ve been 
walking for 15 minutes.&#148; Uranus looked impatient. A second later they 
heard an &#147; oof!&#148;

&#147; What was that?&#148; They looked on into the dark tunnel.

&#147; It was me. I just found the end of our tunnel.&#148; Terrestrial walked 
over to Saturn. She tapped the wall, it made a small sound.

&#147; Ok. Everyone move away. Neptune use your &#145;Titan smash&#146; &#147; Neptune 
stepped forward at her Leaders order.

&#147; Titan Smash!&#148; The wall gave. Showing a huge room where the Inners 
were waiting. Their attention was on something else though. A woman of 
their age. 

She had tanned skin. Her eyes were a brilliant summer pink. Her hair 
was strange. At the roots it was a deep purple. Which molded into a 
royal blue an inch or two down, then a dark red at the tips. It was in 
two long braided pigtails at her sides. The outfit she wore was of a 
straight neckline periwinkle top, the sleeves split from a bow at her 
shoulders. It fit nicely to her waist. The skirt was black and short. 
With a small slit on both sides. Her boots were knee-high and 
periwinkle to match. The woman by now was staring at Terrestrial, with 
an excited look, Memories flashed through Terri&#146;s mind. One sticking.

- The balcony- Terrestrial gasped, drawing attention. She said one 
thing:

&#147; Hyphora&#148;

~****************~~~~~~~~~~**************~~~~~**********

Dun dun dun! Well anyone wanna guess who Hyphora is? No? K. then u can 
find out in the next chapter. But like I said before, it&#146;s far from 
over. More perils await our beloved Rei and Terri. Wait&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;where did 
Endymion go? Bye!</pre>
