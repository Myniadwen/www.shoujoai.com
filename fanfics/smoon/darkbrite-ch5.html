<h1>Dark Skies, Bright Heavens (part 5 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/immora.html">Immora</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/darkbrite-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Michiru sat in the dressing room, shoulders shaking from her 
nervousness. She really didn&#39;t want to go out and play for all those 
people. She&#39;d never shared her music with so many people at once. She 
stared into her reflection, carefully made-up, her hair in an intricate 
style, wearing the most elegant dress her mother could find. Outwardly, 
she looked beautiful, poised, mature, skilled...

She wanted to throw up.

She took a sip of water from a glass sitting on the vanity, and tried to 
calm down. Fifteen minutes till she had to go play. Her siblings had 
chipped in to buy her a bouquet after some prodding from her parents, 
and it sat next to her glass. She carefully touched one of the roses, 
sliding it from the vase, and turned it around in her hands.

It was strange how even little things like this made her think of 
Haruka. Something about the scent of the flower, the way the petals were 
arranged...

She sighed and slipped it back in with the others. 

She suddenly reeled backwards. &quot;not again...&quot; she whispered.

Red, red like blood... the sky was so dark... The sharp sting of the 
gales blowing, bits of debris... Shattering figurines, frozen with looks 
of horror... Her own body clad in a strange suit... Screaming, unheard, 
and a bright light appearing... 

There was a knock on the door, and Kanpeki walked in. &quot;Um, hi, 
Michiru-chan,&quot; she said as she shut the door.

Michiru stirred, looking up dazedly. &quot;K-Kanpeki, what are you doing 
here?&quot;

&quot;I... I was kinda disagreeing with okaa-san and otou-san... So I thought 
I&#39;d check up on you.&quot;

&quot;Oh? What happened?&quot;

&quot;They... it&#39;s nothing. Really... You look really nice.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, so do you.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Kanpeki muttered, sighing as she leaned against the 
doorframe.

&quot;Kanpeki, stop being so negative.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t help it.&quot;

They&#39;d argued over this before. Michiru tried to ignore her sister&#39;s 
moods sometimes, but other times...

&quot;Kanpeki... I don&#39;t mean to offend you, but... you really need to get 
some help.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine!&quot; she snapped, quickly turning her head away.

&quot;You&#39;re crying.&quot;

&quot;I-I am not...&quot;

Michiru walked over to her and lay a hand on her shoulder. &quot;It&#39;s ok, 
it&#39;s going to be ok.&quot;

She felt a wrench in her gut. Here she was, all dressed up for a public 
showing, thanks to her parents wanting to show her off, and her little 
sister was being completely ignored by them. They showered Michiru with 
attention but ignored her. They said they &quot;wanted the best for all their 
children.&quot; _All_ their children?... Hypocrites.

&quot;Look, I have to go out but... you want to stay in here?&quot;

Kanpeki nodded.

&quot;Anything I can do?&quot;

&quot;Um, Murasaki came with me... if you see her, could you tell her to come 
here?&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; Michiru gave her a hug, grabbed her violin, and turned to leave. 
She paused a moment in thought. Kanpeki and Murasaki had really hit it 
off when they met and had quickly become best friends. Aside from this 
recent display, Kanpeki had been in a good mood all week, which was 
quite unusual for her. Ah well.

She opened the door and was surprised to see Murasaki leaning against 
the wall outside. She stood up straight, a bit startled. &quot;Oh, hi, 
Michiru-chan. Kanpeki&#39;s in there, right?&quot;

&quot;Yes, she wanted to see you...&quot; Just &#39;Kanpeki&#39;?... Hadn&#39;t Kanpeki called 
her just &#39;Murasaki&#39; earlier?

&quot;Break a leg,&quot; Murasaki said with a wink, shutting the door behind her.

Michiru nervously walked backstage. Some people nodded to her. The 
curtain was shut still. The crew made some movements and opened the 
curtains, and some lights turned on. Someone gave her a gentle shove. 
&quot;You&#39;re on,&quot; he whispered.

Michiru took a deep breath and gathered herself up, and slowly walked 
onstage. She could feel a spotlight trained on her as she approached the 
center of the stage. She stood there a moment, then curtsied. She 
couldn&#39;t quite see the audience due to the lights, but she knew they 
were there, and in great numbers. She lifted her violin under her chin 
and took another deep breath. Here goes nothing...

She closed her eyes and started playing, losing herself in the music. 
She ignored everything else except for her hands, the bow, the violin, 
the notes. She didn&#39;t care anymore about anything else. She just played.

The first piece finished, and she lowered her instrument, opening her 
eyes. Her senses returned, and she was stunned when she was met with a 
thunderous applause. She felt a pleasant warmth in her cheeks. They 
really liked it? That silly thing that her mom had made her play?

Eventually, she raised the violin for her second piece. A sudden hush 
descended upon the crowd. She was excited now, forgetting how nervous 
she&#39;d been earlier. She played with great enthusiasm, quicker than she 
thought she could. She lost track of how many songs she played, how many 
times the audience stood to cheer for her. It was wonderful.



When it was over, she curtsied deeply, met with loud cheers, and several 
flowers thrown on stage. She smiled and waved, and turned to leave the 
stage. She felt like she was walking on air.

&quot;Wonderful, simply wonderful!&quot; Ki said as she walked over to kiss her 
cheek. &quot;You were fantastic.&quot;

&quot;Excellent playing, Michiru,&quot; Tadashii told her.

&quot;Thank you, okaa-san, otou-san,&quot; she said simply. Ha! She showed them! 
Their little show-and-tell daughter was a lot better than they thought. 
She didn&#39;t need them.

&quot;Kaiou-san, Kaiou-san!&quot; someone shouted, pushing through the throng of 
people that had gathered around. A business card was thrust in her face. 
&quot;I&#39;m a producer at--&quot; he racked off a bunch of things she didn&#39;t care 
about, then finally got to the point. &quot;You were amazing out there, and 
my company would like to offer you a record deal--&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll take it!&quot; Ki exclaimed immediately.

&quot;You are her mother?&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot;

He handed her the card. &quot;Call me and we&#39;ll work out the details.&quot;

&quot;Of course!&quot;

Michiru waved away her parents and walked off towards her dressing room. 
Forget them. This wasn&#39;t about them anymore. She had performed and loved 
it. She was doing this for herself.

She opened the door and jumped a bit in surprise. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry!&quot;

Kanpeki and Murasaki quickly pulled apart from their hug. &quot;I-it&#39;s ok,&quot; 
Kanpeki stammered. &quot;It&#39;s your dressing room, after all.&quot;

&quot;How&#39;d it go?&quot; Murasaki asked.

&quot;Great! It was really fun!&quot;

&quot;Oh, um, glad to hear it.&quot;

&quot;Sorry I missed it,&quot; Kanpeki said, &quot;but I really wasn&#39;t up to it after 
fighting with our parents.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s fine. Well, I need to change...&quot;

&quot;See you in a bit,&quot; Kanpeki said, quickly leaving with Murasaki.

Michiru put her violin in her case and laughed for a long time.



**********



Michiru followed Haruka every chance she got. She passed by her on the 
walk to school, and went out of the way at the end of the day to follow 
her home. She felt silly for doing it, but she&#39;d sometimes climb up into 
a tree near her window, hiding in the leaves, and look into her room, 
watching her for hours. She never had a great deal of homework and it 
was always easy for her, so she didn&#39;t feel any real need to go home. 
Her excuse to her parents was that she was going to a park to study with 
some friends. Eventually, she would have to go home, eat dinner, then 
would quickly do her homework before rushing to talk to Teinei. If she 
had any free time afterwards, she&#39;d swim in the pool and daydream. When 
she wasn&#39;t doing that, she performed on her violin for her fans or was 
at the recording studio. Recently, she&#39;d submitted some paintings to 
museums, and those were on display, but she only rarely went for 
signings.

On weekends, Haruka was in her room almost all the time, sometimes in 
plain sight but other times hiding in her closet, so there was no set 
pattern as to whether Michiru would get the chance to observe her or 
not.

When Haruka&#39;s parents weren&#39;t home, she could occasionally go 
downstairs, so Michiru would go hide in the bushes and watch her through 
the sliding glass door. Either she wasn&#39;t there when it happened or the 
frequency had gone down, but Michiru rarely saw Katai hit Haruka, and 
whenever she stumbled across it, she&#39;d quickly avert her eyes. Usually, 
she&#39;d get there after the fact, and it broke her heart to see Haruka 
curled up in a ball in her room, trembling with pain.

She learned a lot about Haruka just from watching her movements, the 
play of emotions across her face, and especially her glorious eyes. 
Michiru loved her eyes most out of all her physical features; they said 
so much about her through the tiniest movements and color shifts. 
Michiru wished she could talk to her, let Haruka see her, but she knew 
that it would be disastrous to show herself to her too soon.

The strange visions had continued, while she slept and while awake. She 
had no idea what they meant, but they terrified her.

After a few months, Michiru got more daring, and started sneaking out at 
night to watch Haruka sleep. Her family had a row boat they kept down at 
their dock, so she&#39;d go across the lake, pull the boat up at the park,
walk over to the house, and row back when she was too tired to enjoy it 
any more. She couldn&#39;t explain it, but she could somehow sense what it 
was that Haruka dreamt about, even what she thought. It was calming in a 
way to watch her lie under her covers and rest from the hell her life 
had become. Michiru wished this peaceful bliss could last.



&quot;Teinei-san! I&#39;m here!&quot;

Michiru shut the door behind her and locked it. Teinei had started 
leaving it unlocked so Michiru could just come on in whenever she 
arrived. Murasaki was rarely over, she was usually over at the Kaiou&#39;s 
with Kanpeki, and when she was at home, Kanpeki was usually over.

&quot;I&#39;m in the kitchen; could you come help me?&quot;

Teinei was busily preparing a meal, and was rushing around like she had 
very little time to finish. She handed Michiru a bowl before rushing to 
the oven. &quot;Mix that up if you would... I have to get this finished.&quot;

Michiru looked down at the bowl, partially filled with the beginnings of 
a salad. She sat down at the table with it after washing her hands, 
grabbing some spoons to toss it with. &quot;What&#39;s the rush?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry, I forgot to tell you...&quot; She closed the oven door and 
set the timer, then grabbed a bowl of a dough mixture and started 
stirring quickly. &quot;Sunao-chan called a few minutes ago and said she had 
to go to a dinner meeting and was sending Haruka over to have dinner and 
spend some time with me... she&#39;ll be here in half an hour.&quot;

&quot;Really?!&quot;

&quot;Yes... hurry up with the salad if you could... it&#39;s her favorite... I 
have to get everything cleaned up and Murasaki isn&#39;t here cuz she&#39;s 
spending the night at your house with Kanpeki--&quot;

Michiru set the bowl down and grabbed Teinei&#39;s arms and tried to get her 
to settle down. &quot;Teinei-san! You&#39;re just going to wear yourself out if 
you keep moving at this pace.&quot;

Teinei sighed. &quot;I know, I know, but I want everything to be just 
right--&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll appreciate it if you do, but you have to realize that 
everything&#39;s fine as it is. She&#39;ll probably be too busy enjoying the 
fact that she&#39;s not at home to notice whether or not everything&#39;s tidy.&quot;

Teinei started stirring the dough mix again. &quot;You&#39;re probably right... 
Boy, you sure do have her figured out, don&#39;t you?&quot;

Michiru colored a bit and went back to work on the salad. &quot;Well...&quot;

&quot;I know you do; can&#39;t have watched her this long without learning a 
thing or two about how she thinks.&quot;

Michiru nodded a bit.

&quot;Hey, why don&#39;t you stay over, too? See the &#39;vent&#39; covers up on the 
walls near the ceiling? They&#39;re really just up in the attic. The ceiling 
panel in the guest room opens up and a ladder drops down so you can 
climb up into it. You could see and hear everything from up there 
without anyone noticing you. I know you don&#39;t watch to approach her yet, 
so why not do what you always do while she&#39;s here?&quot;

&quot;Sure! Thank you, Teinei-san!&quot;

Teinei laughed a bit. &quot;You&#39;re welcome... now c&#39;mon, I have to at least 
feed her! If we have time after cooking, you can help me straighten up.&quot;

Michiru worked hard to help Teinei finish the meal, preparing everything 
the best she could. Teinei teased her a bit about her eagerness to make 
it perfect, and Michiru just ignored the comments.

While they cooked, Michiru asked, &quot;Teinei-san? I have an... odd question 
to ask you.&quot;

&quot;Eh? Um, okay.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve... you&#39;ve noticed how Kanpeki-chan and Murasaki-san spend a 
_lot_ of time together, right?&quot;

&quot;... Right... -san? Oh yes, she&#39;s older than you three by a bit more 
than a month...&quot;

&quot;I... Well, I have my suspicions... Do you think that... They might 
be... you know...?&quot;

&quot;Ask them yourself,&quot; Teinei replied immediately, turning away from 
Michiru.

Michiru was a bit surprised at the answer, but shrugged and went back to 
work.

With only a few minutes left till Haruka was due to arrive, they quickly 
rearranged the chairs, tossed things that were lying around into the 
hall closet, then sat by the window to wait.

&quot;Here comes Sunao-chan&#39;s car, you better go ahead and get up there,&quot; 
Teinei said.

Michiru nodded, casting one more glance out the window before leaving 
the room. She had to struggle with the ceiling panel a bit to get it 
open, and stepped back to let the ladder slide out. She climbed up, 
pulled the ladder up, and pulled on the string that connected to the 
panel so she could close it again. It was so dark up in there... she 
felt around as she crawled towards the dim light coming from the 
covering in the kitchen, making sure she didn&#39;t accidentally break 
through the ceiling. She then sat there and waited.

Not long afterwards, the doorbell rang, and she heard what she assumed 
was Sunao&#39;s voice along with Teinei&#39;s. Haruka wasn&#39;t saying anything. 
The door shut soon after, and then she could hear their footsteps as 
they walked into the kitchen. Teinei was talking excitedly, telling 
Haruka how happy she was to have her over and how she couldn&#39;t wait to 
talk, and that she was sorry Murasaki wasn&#39;t over to meet her. Haruka 
mumbled &quot;me too&quot; a few times but otherwise said very little.

When they entered the kitchen, Michiru pressed her face up against the 
vent as much as she comfortably could to get a better look. Since it was 
a Saturday, Haruka didn&#39;t wear her school uniform; she instead wore 
loose pants and a dark colored sweatshirt. Typical of her, Michiru 
thought sadly to herself. She never wore anything fitted in public, 
trying to hide her figure from everyone, probably to avoid having boys 
flirt with her. Being slender and well-developed was a combination that 
would lead to a lot of problems with the opposite sex, and Haruka didn&#39;t 
want to be involved with guys.

Teinei helped Haruka fix a plate before they sat down at her table on 
opposite ends, Teinei with her back to Michiru and Haruka facing the 
vent. Michiru smirked a bit. Teinei set her up to be sitting there, just 
so Michiru could stare at Haruka all she wanted. Thoughtful... Michiru 
worried at first that she could be seen, but she remembered Teinei 
assuring her she wouldn&#39;t.

Haruka still hadn&#39;t said anything. She just sat there as if she wasn&#39;t 
going to eat anything, but Michiru could tell she was very hungry. 
Teinei had started eating and looked at Haruka with a puzzled look.

&quot;Excuse me a moment,&quot; Haruka said softly, then she bowed her head, her 
lips moving in a silent prayer. Ah yes, she attended church after all, 
she was supposed to pray before eating. As soon as she finished, she 
grabbed her fork and started eating rather quickly. Michiru worried some 
about this; Haruka didn&#39;t eat much because of her father, so this must 
seem like a gift from Heaven to have all this food at once.

&quot;How&#39;s school going?&quot; Teinei asked her niece.

&quot;Um, I&#39;m making good grades... don&#39;t know how though... That&#39;s about all 
I can say for it. It&#39;s very... well, I hate it.&quot;

She had such a wonderful voice! Michiru sighed aloud, then covered her 
mouth, hoping she wasn&#39;t too audible with it. If she had been, they must 
not have noticed. She felt silly... but then again, she thought, it&#39;s 
very understandable. Haruka&#39;s voice was so incredible; very deep but 
feminine, somewhat soft but with an almost forceful edge to it, and it 
made Michiru shiver with excitement whenever she heard it.

&quot;What about other things... socially and whatnot?&quot;

Wrong question, Michiru groaned inwardly.

Haruka stiffened. &quot;I... I don&#39;t have any friends, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re 
asking. Everyone hates me, thinks I&#39;m weird, fears me...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I shouldn&#39;t have asked--&quot;

&quot;No, you shouldn&#39;t.&quot; Haruka stared down at her plate, pushing her salad 
around with her fork. Michiru saw her eyes soften slightly; she felt bad 
about her comment. &quot;This, um... this is really good... You&#39;re a good 
cook.&quot;

Teinei was amused by that. Michiru could imagine her winking to her as 
she told Haruka, &quot;Thanks, but I had some help. A, uh, a neighbor helped 
me.&quot;

&quot;Oh, well... it&#39;s still good.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll tell her that.&quot;

Haruka was very uncomfortable... Teinei didn&#39;t know what she could talk 
about with her and Haruka was always nervous around other people 
anyways.

&quot;Oba-san?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;I... nevermind, it&#39;ll sound too weird.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right, it probably won&#39;t faze me.&quot;

&quot;... I have the strangest feeling that someone is watching me.&quot;

Michiru could have burst out laughing at that. So Haruka _did_ realize 
she was--

&quot;A lot of the time when I&#39;m at home, I get the same feeling. Practically 
every day. I swear, there&#39;s someone spying on me.&quot;

Michiru froze up in surprise.

Teinei fumbled for something to say, seeming very unsure. &quot;Ummm... 
that&#39;s odd...&quot;

Haruka lightly touched the gold cross she always wore around her neck, 
looking down at her hands.

Apparently, Teinei took this as some sort of sign, and commented, &quot;Maybe 
you have a guardian angel?&quot;

Haruka looked up sharply at her and said, &quot;It sure doesn&#39;t seem like it 
most of the time.&quot; She fell silent and looked away, but she seemed to be 
considering what Teinei said. She ate quietly, seeming to not notice 
whatever it was she put in her mouth.

Michiru could feel her heart pound and she wiped her forehead with the 
back of her hand. Guardian angel, huh? Teinei&#39;s fast thinking might have 
kept Haruka from investigating too much into her feeling, but it was 
still a lie.

&quot;I&#39;m going to put the dishes away... are you done eating?&quot;

Haruka nodded and got out of her chair. &quot;I... I should leave--&quot;

&quot;No, no, stay! We haven&#39;t spent any time together in three years! Why 
are you in such a rush to leave?&quot;

Haruka had a scared look on her face as she whispered, &quot;I need to get 
home before my father does... He, uh, he doesn&#39;t like... coming home to 
an empty house...&quot;

Both Michiru and Teinei easily saw through the lie, and Teinei played 
innocent. &quot;Oh, well, if you need to get home, I&#39;ll give you a ride... 
just tell me when.&quot;

&quot;Please... I&#39;ll come over some other time, if I can...&quot;

&quot;Um, just go on out to the car, I&#39;ll be out in a minute.&quot;

Haruka nodded weakly and went outside. Teinei looked up at the vent. 
&quot;You should probably go home as soon as we&#39;ve pulled away, all right? 
Wait a few minutes.&quot;

&quot;All right... thanks for letting me stay over...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome. Sorry that it was so short, but it&#39;s better to keep 
Haruka out of trouble. Tell Murasaki to remember to be home by noon 
tomorrow; she has a piano recital.&quot;

&quot;Mm hmm... see you later.&quot;

&quot;Bye.&quot;

Teinei left, and Michiru carefully got out of the attic and went home.



Haruka waved Teinei goodbye, waiting to go inside until she&#39;d left. She 
was scared, numb all over from terror. Katai was home, she could feel 
it. He was watching her from the window. Damnit, why did her mother have 
to make her go see Teinei?! If she hadn&#39;t, she wouldn&#39;t have to face 
_him_...

She walked up to the front door, afraid to enter. The door swung open, a 
deeply frowning Katai standing there. &quot;Come inside. You have some 
explaining to do.&quot;

Haruka shakily walked in, trying to keep from crying. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, 
okaa-san made me go see Teinei-san while she went to that dinner! I 
would have come home sooner but--&quot;

The door shut with a loud slam as he led her to the family room. &quot;You 
better not have told her anything.&quot;

&quot;No! Of course not!&quot;

Katai scowled at her. &quot;Why are you so jumpy?!&quot;

Haruka trembled and avoided meeting his gaze. &quot;I... I...&quot;

&quot;Stupid coward... you better not have made her suspicious...&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t--&quot;

&quot;I bet you did! Why don&#39;t you listen, you&#39;re such a fool!&quot;

&quot;But I--&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve had enough.&quot;

Haruka whimpered and ducked down to avoid the first swing he threw at 
her. He growled with anger. &quot;Don&#39;t you dare try to get out of this! 
You&#39;re going to get punished even more if you try to stop me!&quot;

Haruka started sobbing, instinctively raising her arms in defense 
whenever he tried to hit her. Teinei said she had a guardian angel 
watching her?... yeah, right...



Michiru went to Haruka&#39;s house as soon as she&#39;d checked in at home, and 
saw that she wasn&#39;t in her room. Climbing out of the tree and into the 
bushes, she saw Haruka in the family room, and Katai pummeling her 
mercilessly. Michiru could feel all the blood drain from her face and 
tears pour down her cheeks. Her fingers twitched spasmodically, wanting 
to reach out and stop what was happening, but the risk to Haruka...

Michiru had hidden in the tree again, slipping a few times from the 
blurred vision her tears caused. Haruka stumbled into her room after 
several minutes, too weak to do anything besides collapse into her bed 
and pass out.

Michiru could hear the blood pounding in her ears, her throat go dry. 
She had to do something... Haruka could bleed to death if no one helped 
her... She heard a car pulling away, and after straining hard to see, 
saw that Katai had left the house. Sunao was still at that dinner... 
that left Haruka alone, unconscious, unable to stop the bleeding...

Michiru fumbled for the key to the house after slipping down the tree 
trunk, sliding open the door before rushing upstairs quickly. She found 
Haruka&#39;s room with ease, the door being unlocked and therefore not an 
obstacle. Michiru stopped when she first entered the room, standing 
there for long moments. Haruka looked terribly fragile as she lay there, 
hopeless, desperately needing help. Michiru haltingly stepped forward 
and lay her hands gently on her shoulders, sliding her up the bed to a 
better position that would be more comfortable for her when she regained 
consciousness.

She had to look around for a bit to find the bathroom, but once it was 
found, she gather up heavy amounts of cotton balls, gauze, hydrogen 
peroxide, ointments, a few washcloths, and two large bowls which she 
filled with hot water.

She brought them all into Haruka&#39;s room, laying some items on the 
nightstand and the rest on her bed. She found a large, clean shirt in 
the closet, and fought to keep her hands from trembling as she carefully 
slipped off Haruka&#39;s bloody shirt and jeans. Michiru was horrified by 
just how so pale she was from blood loss, her skin seemed almost as 
white as her undergarments. She washed all her wounds carefully, dipping 
in one bowl to rinse the cloth and the other to wet it with clean water, 
applying hydrogen peroxide to all the cuts, then smoothing ointment on 
them with as much care as possible, and finally wrapping gauze where it 
was needed, then slipping the clean shirt on her.

Michiru pulled the sheets carefully over the tall girl before replacing 
all the items she&#39;d taken out, then going back into her room. She gazed 
at her wistfully, smoothing her blond hair back from her face, letting 
her hand linger on her cheek. She sighed, wiped away her tears, then 
whispered, &quot;Please get better... please live, Haruka... I love you...&quot; 
She stood there a few more minutes, just looking down at her.

She was very startled when she heard a very weak, choked groan and saw 
Haruka&#39;s eyelids fluttering open slightly. Michiru quickly backed away 
as Haruka, not quite coherent, rested a hand on her forehead and made a 
pained, muffled sound. She rushed downstairs and out the door, locking 
it behind her, then ran down to the lake, climbing into the row boat, 
frantically turning the oars so she could get home.

It didn&#39;t take as long as usual for her to climb up to her window. She 
was very shocked when she reached to open it and it didn&#39;t budge. Why 
wouldn&#39;t it open... open open open--

She let out a scream when Suteki and Kirei&#39;s angry faces appeared in the 
window, then it flew open and they grabbed her, dragging her back in. 
Suteki slid it shut and pushed her to her bed and Kirei locked the door. 
Michiru let out several choked sobs then cried, &quot;What&#39;s going on?! What 
was that for?!&quot;

&quot;We know what&#39;s going on,&quot; Suteki hissed. &quot;We have to do something about 
it.&quot;

&quot;W-What do you mean--&quot;

&quot;Michiru,&quot; Kirei growled, &quot;we aren&#39;t stupid. You&#39;ve spent more time away 
from home in the last few months... ever since that when we were walking 
to school and you saw that Ten&#39;ou girl... And now you leave at night, 
too.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know what--&quot;

&quot;Oh _shut-up_!&quot; Suteki snarled. &quot;You&#39;re a dyke and in love with that 
psycho, you can&#39;t deny it. You were there several minutes ago, we saw 
you coming from her house using Kanzen&#39;s telescope. We want to know why 
the hell you&#39;re doing something like this.&quot;

Michiru paled and looked away. &quot;I don&#39;t have to tell you anything. You 
have no idea--&quot;

&quot;What we know,&quot; Kirei interrupted, &quot;is that you have a lot of explaining 
to do, and we better get some good answers.&quot;

Michiru buried herself under the covers, and they were quickly snatched 
away by her oldest sister. &quot;Leave me alone!&quot; she snapped. &quot;You have no 
right to butt into my life!&quot;

&quot;Well what have you been doing with it, huh? Look at you, you&#39;ve got 
blood stains on your clothes and skin, where did that come from?!&quot; 
Suteki demanded. &quot;We have a right to know, you&#39;re our _sister_, or have 
you forgotten that you have a family?!&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you--&quot;

&quot;Damnit, give us some answers!&quot;

&quot;Leave me ALONE!!!&quot; Michiru shouted at her, grabbing for her alarm clock 
to throw at Suteki, when Kirei gripped her wrists and held her back.

&quot;Michiru, stop it! Calm down! Look, we&#39;re just mad because you&#39;ve been 
going behind our backs for months... some of us,&quot; she glared at her 
other sister, &quot;are overreacting. But we deserve to know. Please, let&#39;s 
all just be rational, okay? Michiru-chan, please just tell us what&#39;s 
going on.&quot;

Michiru sat crying for a few minutes while they just stood there. 
&quot;Fine... fine... you want to know? You really want to know? I love her; 
I admit that much. I love her dearly, completely, and she means 
everything to me. I follow her and watch her because there&#39;s nothing I&#39;d 
rather do than be in her presence. I don&#39;t care if you don&#39;t approve of 
that, because quite frankly, your opinions won&#39;t affect me a bit.&quot;

She let that sink in a moment, before Kirei quietly whispered, &quot;Do you 
want us to let the rest of the family know?&quot;

&quot;Not okaa-san and otou-san... I could care less whether you know...&quot;

&quot;...The blood, Michiru? Where did that come from?&quot; Suteki asked.

&quot;None of your concern.&quot;

&quot;Michiru-chan...&quot; Suteki started.

&quot;Leave me alone,&quot; Michiru said, getting out of bed. She stood there with 
a determined look on her face. &quot;Get out of here, _now_.&quot;

They turned and left, and she shut the door quietly behind them and 
locked it, before sliding down along it to the floor. She lay there, 
crying herself into exhaustion, whispering, &quot;Why... why... why...&quot;



She apparently had fallen asleep for a little while; she woke up hearing 
someone lightly knocking on her door. She groaned and opened it slowly, 
and saw Kanzen there. He politely asked to come in, and she grumbled a 
bit but consented. He closed it, and said quietly, &quot;I just wanted to 
say... Suteki told me what happened, her version at least, and... Well, 
you&#39;re my sister, and I love you. You&#39;ll always be my sister, and this 
doesn&#39;t change anything. I support you in this, so if they give you a 
hard time, don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be here for you.&quot;

Michiru hugged her oldest brother, crying a bit against his shoulder. 
&quot;Thank you, Kanzen... I love you too.&quot;

He smiled at her when he pulled away. &quot;Well, I have more studying to do, 
as always.&quot; He laughed a bit, then said, &quot;I think Genki and Kanpeki want 
to talk to you too... you _are_ triplets, after all.&quot;

&quot;As if I could forget... Bye...&quot;

Sure enough, Genki came in when Kanzen left, and he shyly shut the door. 
&quot;Michiru-chan?&quot;

&quot;Hmmm?&quot;

&quot;I, uh...&quot; He blushed a bit and coughed, then started again. &quot;Well, I 
heard about, y&#39;know, and... You&#39;re not alone, you know. There&#39;s other 
people in the family that are... y&#39;know...&quot;

Michiru&#39;s eyes widened a bit. &quot;Are you saying...&quot;

He smiled sheepishly. &quot;I only told Kanzen... trust him more than the 
others... we&#39;ve always gotten along.&quot;

Michiru smiled at him and hugged him. She winked as she commented, &quot;I 
always wondered about all those male movie star posters in your room...&quot;

He blushed again and laughed. &quot;Well, I&#39;m going now... Heh heh, you&#39;re 
piling up the guests; Kanpeki&#39;s here with Murasaki-chan, and I think 
you&#39;ll find this very... interesting. It&#39;s quite a neat phenomenon we 
triplets have... Bye.&quot;

&quot;Bye.&quot;

Michiru had to wait several minutes for her little sister to appear. 
When she finally peeked in through the cracked door, Michiru had started 
sketching a picture of Haruka. She didn&#39;t notice Kanpeki and Murasaki at 
first.

&quot;Is that Haruka?&quot;

Michiru jumped and dropped her sketchbook. Kanpeki giggled and picked it 
up, flipping through it and showing some of the drawings to Murasaki, 
who had asked the question.

&quot;The drawings of Haruka-chan seem pretty accurate... I&#39;ve only seen 
photos of her but they look like those...&quot;

&quot;Um... thank you... I enjoy drawing her very much.&quot;

Kanpeki looked up abruptly with a grin. It always surprised Michiru when 
she did that; she had gotten used to Kanpeki&#39;s happy-to-sad phases and 
she&#39;d been pretty steadily happy once she&#39;d met Murasaki. After years of 
the other way, it was taking Michiru awhile to adjust. &quot;I draw too, you 
know,&quot; Kanpeki commented. &quot;I never show them off because... well, 
everyone ignores me anyways... and you probably notice I paint, but 
noooo, do obaa- san and otou-san ever notice mine, only yours... I&#39;m 
just the younger of us three that most forget exists--&quot;

&quot;Kanpeki!&quot; Murasaki interjected. &quot;Stop talking negatively about 
yourself.&quot;

&quot;Well, Murasaki, it&#39;s true... isn&#39;t it, Michiru-chan?&quot;

Michiru blushed a bit. She never had been close to her siblings... Wait 
a sec, they used just first names with each other? Huh?

Murasaki whispered in her ear, and Michiru barely picked up the words, 
&quot;How could they forget _you_?... Silly...&quot;

Kanpeki handed her the sketchbook, as well as a well-worn, blue bound 
volume. &quot;Want to flip through mine?

Michiru carefully turned the pages, surprised by how well her sister 
drew compared to other people she knew. Hmmm, guess the art talent is a 
family thing... There were an awful lot of pictures of Murasaki...

Michiru looked up at her with wide eyes. Were her suspicions right?... 
&quot;Kanpeki-chan... may I talk to you alone?&quot;

Kanpeki looked over at Murasaki, who smiled and gave her shoulder a 
reassuring squeeze before leaving and shutting the door behind her.

&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;You just happened to come talk to me when all this talk about me is 
going on... Do _you_ have something to say to me, too?&quot;

Kanpeki blushed and looked away quickly. &quot;Well... yeah...&quot; She coughed a 
bit and said quietly. &quot;I&#39;m a lesbian, too.&quot;

Michiru was quick to hug her sister tightly, crying openly. &quot;Oh my 
gosh... first Genki now... I suspected it for awhile... my gosh, all of 
us! All three of us!&quot;

They drew away, and after a pause, Michiru asked softly, &quot;Kanpeki-chan, 
you... have feelings for Murasaki-san... don&#39;t you?&quot;

Kanpeki nodded and whispered, &quot;She doesn&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;Are you afraid to admit what you are to her?&quot;

Kanpeki laughed weakly and looked up at the ceiling. &quot;Oh... no, she 
knows that I... have other interests, so to speak... and she does as 
well... she just doesn&#39;t know that she&#39;s the one I&#39;m in love with.&quot;

&quot;Are you going to tell her, or are you waiting to see if she returns 
your feelings?&quot; Michiru asked in a concerned voice.

Kanpeki sat down and sighed. &quot;I want to wait for some sign that she is 
interested in me, too... I&#39;d feel stupid if I just told her and she 
didn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;I take it you&#39;ve given this a lot of thought?&quot;

&quot;A _great_ deal of thought.&quot; Kanpeki curled up in a ball. &quot;She&#39;s what 
makes my life worth living,&quot; she whispered. &quot;She&#39;s the reason I&#39;ve 
gotten over all those wacky emotional problems I used to have. I&#39;m just 
so scared I&#39;ll lose her friendship if I tell her...&quot;

Michiru hugged her and said, &quot;It&#39;s better to wait then... but somehow... 
I don&#39;t think you have to worry.&quot;

Kanpeki looked up at her with wide eyes. &quot;Y-you think so?&quot;

&quot;Well, I always thought that you _were_ a couple! And she does seem to 
like you a lot... I think she&#39;s just as nervous as you are! If you two 
could just get up the nerve, you would make a great couple!&quot;

Kanpeki laughed and hugged her back. &quot;Thanks, Michiru-chan! ... Funny 
how two Kaiou sisters both fall for two girls who are relatives, isn&#39;t 
it?&quot;

Michiru winked. &quot;It is, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ve just got good selection amongst them, I suppose.&quot;

&quot;Very,&quot; Michiru said with a grin.

&quot;So gorrrrrgeous...&quot; Kanpeki sighed deeply and clasped her hands tightly 
under her chin.

&quot;Mmm hmm!&quot;

They both giggled.

&quot;Well... you should probably go now... don&#39;t want to keep her waiting.&quot; 
Michiru smiled at her sister as she said this.

&quot;Yeah... sleep well, Michiru-chan.&quot;

&quot;You too, Kanpeki-chan.&quot;

Michiru sat still for several moments after she left. &quot;She forgot her 
art,&quot; she murmured, setting it aside as she lay down on her bed. She 
felt hot tears forming in her eyes. She was glad that her sister had 
found someone that made her happy, and that there was a good chance of a 
relationship developing, but she was incredibly jealous. Murasaki was 
right there, all Kanpeki had to do was work up the nerve to tell her. 
Michiru, however, couldn&#39;t even speak to the girl she loved or she could 
risk losing any chance with her.

Michiru couldn&#39;t help it; she cried herself to sleep.



She couldn&#39;t move much more than several inches, and that was only her 
arm. She was in great pain, confusion, and felt more tired than she ever 
had before. She couldn&#39;t sit up, couldn&#39;t speak, couldn&#39;t _anything_, it 
seemed. She was bruised and cut, swollen in places, her throat too 
pained from being choked to make a sound. Her vision was blurry, and she 
could feel a dull throb going through her body.

But Haruka had her thoughts. All those thoughts, churning through her 
head. After all, at the moment, they were probably all she was capable 
of.

She could vaguely remember the beating, thank God that it was only a 
vague recollection; Katai screamed at her for awhile before he started 
hitting her, then the rest was a blur of pain. What had happened to her? 
She could remember stumbling upstairs, then a swirl of colors and black, 
and a jolt of pain, but that was about it.

Her eyes moved downward to look at herself. She was wearing a large, 
clean shirt. Her wounds had been wrapped with gauze, cleaned, done with 
obvious care. But who did it? No one was home--

White. Pure, blinding white. Like a light from heaven, perhaps. A faint 
blur of colors, a peachy tone framed by wavy aquamarine, the features 
hard to make out in the light, only the sad smile and the warmth of the 
blue eyes could clearly be seen. Beauty... she knew the figure to be 
beautiful, but she couldn&#39;t see... And then the wonderful being was 
gone. Was that an angel perhaps? A guardian angel... 

She let her head sink further into her pillows. She could have died 
tonight, she knew it. But she&#39;d been saved from that by someone, who was 
it though? She could faintly recall--

A wonderfully pleasing smell, of vanilla, maybe a bit of rose mixed in, 
the warm and tender caress of a hand on her cheek, and a soft voice... 
What were the words? She couldn&#39;t make out the jumble too well...

plesgtbterplselivhrukailovyu...

Huh? That didn&#39;t make sense...

Pleasegetbetterpleaseliveharukailoveyou...

She thought she could make out words in there but--

i love you

Her heart started pounding fast. No... that couldn&#39;t have been what she 
heard... she couldn&#39;t have heard that...

I love you.

A tear started making its way down her cheek. She could remember the 
voice though, and she could hear the beautiful voice saying it, in her 
mind.

&quot;...I love you...&quot;

She let out a tiny cry and let her tears flow freely. She _had_ heard 
that... she had heard... oh God... someone... someone had saved her 
life, someone had cared, a beautiful angel, and she loved her! _Her_! 
Ten&#39;ou Haruka, of all people... She really _did_ have a guardian 
angel...

&quot;Haruka-chan! Are you up there?&quot;

Haruka froze, her breath catching in her throat. That voice... 
okaa-san... Oh no. Oh no oh no oh no. Her door was open she couldn&#39;t 
move to shut it footsteps echoed up the stairs her mother was coming up 
here she&#39;d see--

&quot;Oh my God...&quot;

Haruka shut her eyes, letting the liquid spill from the corners, as 
Sunao ran over to her with a sob. &quot;Haruka! Oh my God, oh my God, what 
happened to you, you&#39;re--&quot;

Sunao pulled back quickly. &quot;Haruka... you were home alone once you got 
back from Teinei&#39;s... I know you were here and didn&#39;t leave but...&quot; She 
froze in place. &quot;Katai was with you for awhile though... oh my God...&quot; 
Her hands flew to her mouth as she started trembling. &quot;Oh no... Oh no... 
Haruka... if you can talk... please, tell me the truth...&quot;

Haruka&#39;s eyes opened, a pleading look in them.

&quot;Did he-- Is he the one-- ?&quot;

Haruka&#39;s tears were overflowing from her eyes, and she let them flutter 
shut again as she tilted her head the best she could.

But it was enough.

Sunao swayed on her feet, resting her hand against the wall to steady 
herself. Katai... her husband... he&#39;d beat his own daughter... he&#39;d 
nearly killed their only living child...

&quot;Oh lord, how could he have done this, how could this have happened?&quot; 
Sunao cried, coming over to Haruka. She carefully took her daughter&#39;s 
hand, wiping away both their tears. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Haruka-chan, I should 
have seen it sooner... Oh God, what are we going to do? If I try to tell 
someone, he could find out and hurt you more... What do we do... oh 
God...&quot;

She sniffled and turned away, curled up tightly.

&quot;What in the name of heaven can we do?&quot;
