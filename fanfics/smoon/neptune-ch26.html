<p align="center">-XX-</p>
<p>Near the end of May, Usagi and Luna  encountered a young miko named Rei Hino, and Sailor Mars was found.  Almost a month later, a new girl at Usagi's school by the name of  Makoto Kino was shown to be yet another Senshi, Sailor Jupiter. It was  around the time of Jupiter's awakening that the Doom Tree Makaiju and  its two inhabitants Ail and Ann passed Pluto as it entered the solar  system.</p>
<p>Sailor V, meanwhile, had slowly fallen for an idol by the  name of Ace Kaitou. Around the first of August, however, it was  revealed that he was secretly Danburite, the head of the Dark Agency.  Worse, the Dark Agency itself turned out to be a radical offshoot of  the Dark Kingdom itself. During their final rooftop battle, Ace  revealed that during the Silver Millennium he was a lowly servant by  the name of Adonis who had fallen in love with Princess Venus, but that  his love wasn't reciprocated.</p>
<p>As Sailor V defeated Ace, his  footing gave way and he slipped off the roof. &quot;My path ends,&quot; he said  as he fell, &quot;Without ever reaching you... That is my fate...&quot;</p>
<p>Sailor  V lunged forward and managed to grab his hand. The effort nearly jerked  her shoulder out of socket as he dangled from the rooftop. &quot;Is it your  fate to defeat the ones I fall in love with yourself?&quot; she gasped in  pain.</p>
<p>Ace looked up at her, a vacant look in his eyes. With his  free hand, he tossed up a playing card to her. The card landed next to  her. She looked at it questioningly.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ace of hearts?&quot; she  asked. Ace had a talent for telling love fortunes with playing cards,  especially with the Aces of the various suits. As she looked at the  card however, it slowly tore apart and crumbled before her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll  tell your final love fortune,&quot; he said weakly, a malevolent smile  forming at the corners of his lips, &quot;Your love will be hopeless for all  eternity.&quot;</p>
<p>She stared at him wide eyed. With his last remaining strength, Ace had cursed her.</p>
<p>&quot;What's  wrong?&quot; he continued, his body slowly beginning to disintegrate as  Sailor V struggled to hold onto him. &quot;You should look happier. Now you  can go on living, without having to torment yourself over the ultimate  choice, your love or your duty. Your fate is to continue fighting. Your  true battle begins now...&quot; His voice faded away as he completely  crumbled to dust before Sailor V's eyes.</p>
<p>Artemis had been watching the battle from nearby. As soft sobs shook Sailor V's body, he cautiously approached her. &quot;Mina...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My self before now has all been before awakening,&quot; she whispered, &quot;A temporary form, for my true mission.&quot;</p>
<p>Artemis  was silent. For so long, Minako had treated being Sailor V as some sort  of a game, even as a chance at stardom. It had taken both the incident  in England and now Ace Kaitou's curse to finally force the girl to  understand the stakes involved. Artemis found no pleasure in seeing his  charge in pain, however. As Sailor V rose to her knees and looked out  over the edge of the building, Artemis wished that there had been  another way.</p>
<p>&quot;I must search for my precious allies,&quot; she said as  she wiped the tears from her eyes with the back of her hand, &quot;They're  in Tokyo. I feel it. Perhaps I am awakening now.&quot;</p>
<p>Artemis was unsure what to say to that. &quot;Hai,&quot; he finally answered softly.</p>
<p>&quot;Together,  we will defeat the Dark Kingdom and protect this planet!&quot; she declared,  standing to her feet and clenching her fist, She then turned to  Artemis, fixing him with a determined stare as she continued. &quot;Then, we  must find that most precious person. That is why I was born.&quot;</p>
<p>Artemis  nodded. They would indeed join the other Sailor Senshi and find that  most precious person, the Princess. Less than a week later Sailor V,  now Sailor Venus, had joined the others.</p>
<p>Around the beginning of  September, Tuxedo Kamen was kidnapped by the Dark Kingdom and  brainwashed into becoming an agent of the enemy. As Queen Beryl gloated  in triumph, one and a half light years away the injured Princess Kakyuu  traveled from her planet Kinmoku in search of asylum from Sailor  Galaxia. Her guardians, the Sailor Starlights, followed her trail  throughout the vast emptiness of space as they desperately looked for  her. The trail would eventually lead the three to a small blue planet  orbiting a medium sized yellow star near the outer edge of the Milky  Way galaxy known as Earth.</p>
<p>As September gave way to October and  the final battle with Queen Beryl was approaching, Michiru and Haruka  continued on as before. They were aware of the existence of the other  Senshi of course, but they kept their distance. The Inner Senshi had  their mission to fulfill, and Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus had  theirs.</p>
<p>They continued to fight the Death Busters in the shadows,  their very existence kept secret even as Sailor Moon and the others  became household names. Haruka and Michiru had seen first the Sailor V  video games and dolls, followed by Sailor Moon lunch boxes and coloring  books. It served to further separate the two from the others though,  causing an unspoken rift to form between the serious older Senshi and  the seemingly lackadaisical younger ones.</p>
<p>Between the two of them  they were able to afford a nice rental property off-campus, complete  with an indoor pool. Haruka walked into the pool area wearing a  loose-fitting tank top and white track shorts. She carried a large  brown towel, and as she watched Michiru swimming laps in her sleek  one-piece dark blue swim suit she couldn't help but glance as the  swimmer's back. The scars from the battle she'd fought back when  Hironari's brother Goseki had been turned into a daemon were almost  completely gone now save for a few faint lines still visible if one  knew where to look.</p>
<p>Michiru reached the end of the pool and  climbed out. Haruka came over and wrapped the towel around her, using  it as an opportunity to envelop the swimmer in her arms. Michiru turned  around and stroked the side of Haruka's face with the palm of her hand.  the racer closed her eyes and leaned her head into the hand, when she  suddenly felt a sharp pain in her earlobe.</p>
<p>&quot;Ow!&quot; Haruka shouted as Michiru tugged on her earlobe, &quot;Wha...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That'll teach you to flirt with other girls,&quot; the artist said with a smirk.</p>
<p>&quot;Michiru,  we've already been through this,&quot; Haruka said, the two far too close  now to bother with honorifics. &quot;I was just ordering a coffee...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Since when has winking at the waitress been part of the ordering process?&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka shrugged. &quot;Just habit I guess,&quot; she offered with a roguish grin.</p>
<p>Michiru  rolled her eyes, &quot;Just make sure you look and don't touch.&quot; Draping the  towel over her wet locks, she took on a more serious air. &quot;Did the map  help?&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka shook her head. &quot;No. I went over the map, marking  where the last few battles have taken place, but I can't find any sort  of pattern so far.&quot;</p>
<p>The artist frowned as she crossed her arms  thoughtfully. &quot;This new Death Buster, Kaolinite, isn't acting at all  like Zultan did. She disappears from the scene after releasing her  daemon rather than sticking around like the witch did. And before the  attacks would be separated by a month or two, now they're separated by  only a few days to a week. Why the increase?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>The  next morning, the sun was just rising over the eastern horizon.  Kaolinite walked silently into the bedroom, shaking her head in  disbelief. &quot;You've got to be kidding me.&quot;</p>
<p>Hotaru ignored her as she continued to look out. Her friend no longer jogged past her window anymore. Why?</p>
<p>&quot;Every morning you get up, and every morning you come downstairs more depressed than before.&quot;</p>
<p>Hotaru  sighed heavily. She tried to ignore Kaolinite's comments as she put her  hand up to the window, closing her eyes as she fought the urge to give  into despair.</p>
<p>&quot;What did you expect, that someday you'd be able to go out jogging too? What did I tell you about hopes and dreams?&quot;</p>
<p>Hotaru  began to tremble, her sadness giving way to something new as she grit  her teeth. Opening her eyes, the only emotion she felt was a cold  venomous anger.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you expect you'd someday meet the jogger, maybe even become friends? Did you expect...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  expect pure heart crystals,&quot; she said, turning around to face  Kaolinite. Her eyes glowed an unholy color as the stuffed animals  behind her were suddenly cast into ominous shadows.</p>
<p>Kaolinite's eyes widened. &quot;But... But I...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pure heart crystals, not excuses,&quot; Hotaru ordered, &quot;You can save those for Professor Tomoe.&quot;</p>
<p>Kaolinite  swallowed hard as she nodded and quickly left the room. Alone once  more, Hotaru's eyes rolled up into the back of her head and she sank to  the floor. She brought her hands up to her head, a whimper escaping as  a migrane struck. Looking around, the last thing she could remember was  Kaolinite coming into her room. She hated the blackouts. She got up and  went downstairs to make sure nothing bad happened this time...</p>

<p align="center">-Epilogue-</p>
<p align="center">-Six Months Later-</p>
<p>Michiru  had been fighting as Sailor Neptune for a year and a half now, and for  a little more than a year Sailor Uranus had been by her side. Both were  weary and frustrated. They had yet to find the Messiah who would be  able to stem the tide of the coming Silence. They also had yet to  locate any of the talismans needed for the Grail. The last few months  since Kaolinite had taken over seemed to be a never ending series of  battles with no end in sight and seemingly no light at the end of the  tunnel.</p>
<p>Haruka, for all her bravado, seemed to be the most  dispirited of the two. Even after all the months that had passed since  her awakening and all the battles fought, the thought that once they <em>did</em> find find a talisman that someone would have to die continued to weigh  heavily on her. Michiru did what she could to keep the blonde going,  but the stress was slowly taking a toll on them both.</p>
<p>And now,  once again, the seas were stormy. And just like a dozen times before,  Haruka and Michiru transformed into Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune.  As the rest of Tokyo blissfully went about its business, the two Senshi  rushed to the scene of the Death Buster's latest attack.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>&quot;Now,  Sailor Moon!&quot; Tuxedo Kamen yelled as he distracted the new enemy.  Sailor Moon nodded apprehensively. Behind her Ami, Makoto and Minako  were each already captured and pinned to the trunks of large trees  within the grounds of the Hikara Shrine. In front of her was a new and  dangerous enemy that appeared seemingly out of nowhere.</p>
<p>And  behind the monster was Rei, still dressed in her miko uniform, pinned  to the stone wall surrounding the shrine. It was her screams that had  alerted Sailor Moon that something was wrong. Together with their  friends they had taken on and defeated both the Dark Kingdom and the  Black Moon Clan. She was not going to lose Rei to this new enemy.</p>
<p>&quot;Moon Princess Halation!&quot;</p>
<p>The  daemon scowled at her, &quot;Damn you! Very bad triangle!&quot; it shouted,  releasing an attack of its own. Before the stunned eyes of all, it  overpowered Sailor Moon's attack, knocking the girl's staff from her  hands.</p>
<p>&quot;The most unlucky day!&quot; It bellowed as it flew towards  Sailor Moon, pinning her against a large oak with its hands and feet.  Its hands and feet detached, leaving Sailor Moon still trapped against  the tree as it tore the transformation broach from the girl with its  teeth. As the broach struck the ground, Sailor Moon transformed against  her will back into Usagi.</p>
<p>Usagi stared down at herself in wide-eyed shock. &quot;Can such a thing...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Usako!&quot;  Tuxedo Kamen shouted. The daemon then attacked him binding him in  vines. He fell from the stone wall he was standing on to the hard earth  below.</p>
<p>Luna shook her head. &quot;I can't watch anymore!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Luna!&quot;  Artemis cried as both he and Luna attacked the youma. The daemon simply  tossed them aside like rag dolls. The two cats violently hit a tree  trunk before they fell limply to the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;Is that the last  interruption?&quot; the daemon asked sarcastically. Looking back over to  Rei, it smiled maliciously. &quot;Then I shall take my time to get the pure  heart.&quot; The daemon then shot a black ray out of a five pointed star on  her chest. Rei screamed out in pain as her heart crystal was at last  extracted.</p>
<p>&quot;Rei-chan, hold it together!&quot; Usagi screamed as the  miko's head fell forward as her whole body went limp. Usagi began to  weep. Earlier in the day she and Rei had discussed their future hopes  and dreams. Now the beautiful young miko looked almost dead as she hung  limply from the wall, her heart crystal floating in front of her. The  daemon laughed as it strode over and snatched the crystal. &quot;There must  be a talisman inside this crystal of her pure heart,&quot; it declared  confidently.</p>
<p>&quot;Give that back to Rei!&quot; Usagi sobbed, her lower lip  trembling as she continued to struggle to free herself, &quot;I won't  forgive you!&quot;</p>
<p>The daemon turned to Usagi and grinned. &quot;Humph,  humans. I...&quot; It never got to finish its taunt. A huge yellow ball of  energy struck it from behind, nearly tearing the daemon apart. &quot;Wha--!?  What in the world is going on!?&quot; In response, an aquamarine ball of  energy struck it. The daemon screamed in agony before transforming back  into a tree.</p>
<p>Usagi and the others freed themselves and ran over  to Rei. As the trembling blonde held the miko in her arms, Luna looked  on anxiously with the others. Something out of the corner of her eye,  however, caused her to turn around and look back up at the trees. She  saw two shadowy figures standing on a branch of one of the trees, their  forms obscured by the foliage. As she gazed up at them, she realized  that one of them was holding Rei's pure heart crystal that the daemon  had dropped.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a talisman,&quot; the one holding the crystal said dejectedly in a low, almost husky voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Looks like we had the wrong target,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A trip wasted.&quot; And with that, the figure holding the heart crystal tossed it back towards Rei.</p>
<p>&quot;Rei  chan, answer me,&quot; Usagi whimpered as she continued to hold her friend  tightly in her arms. She looked up just in time to see the miko's heart  crystal float down and reenter Rei's chest. The girl trembled, then  slowly opened her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;U... Usagi-chan?&quot;</p>
<p>Usagi and the  other Senshi hugged their friend tightly, overjoyed that she was  alright again. As Rei did her best to assure everyone she was fine, the  two figures in the tree quickly jumped down to the ground and leaped  away. Artemis, who watched their departure with Luna, came slowly over  to the other cat's side. &quot;Those two...&quot;</p>
<p>Once things had calmed  down a bit, the Senshi were able to take stock of what had just  happened. &quot;The new enemy seems to be after people with pure hearts,&quot;  Ami noted.</p>
<p>Rei nodded, &quot;They said something about talismans being inside them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And those two mysterious people...&quot; Artemis put in.</p>
<p>Usagi took a deep breath. &quot;A new battle is about to begin,&quot; she said apprehensively.</p>
<p>As  the full gravity of their princess' words sank in on the Senshi,  elsewhere Sailor Neptune landed on a rooftop with Sailor Uranus. With a  heavy heart, she wondered if they'd ever find the talismans or the  Messiah. She brushed her aquamarine locks away from her eyes with the  back of her hand as she allowed a dejected sigh to escape.</p>
<p>She  felt Uranus hand on her shoulder, and looked over at her. The blonde  could tell what Neptune was thinking, and silently communicated that  understanding in her eyes. Neptune took her hand and squeezed it  tightly. They were each other's strength now, and together they would  somehow see it through to the end.</p>
<p>Their hands separated, and they were off once again...</p>
<p align="center">-Finis-</p>
<p>End Notes: And that, as they say, is that.</p>
<p>First  of all, I want to thank each and every one of you who have read,  enjoyed and critiqued this story. It means more than you can imagine to  know that you have all enjoyed my attempt at what originally simply  going to be Sailor Neptune's story and instead ended up becoming more  of a prequel to Sailor Moon told from Michiru's perspective.</p>
<p>Secondly,  before anyone writes about it in their review, the original names of  the characters from the Doom Tree story arc were Ail and Ann, but the  AD Video translated them as <em>Ali</em> and Ann. I decided to go with the former.</p>
<p>And  finally, for those who are interested; Miyuki Fuji, Yuhka Asami and  Takayo Oyama are three actresses who played Sailor Neptune in the  Sailor Moon musicals. I borrowed from all three names to name the  characters of sempai Miyuki Asami and roommate Takayo Fuji. And  Miyuki's new freshman she's mentoring from chapter 18, Keiko Kitagawa,  got her name from the actress who played Sailor Mars in the live action  Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon series. Finally, Principal Ichi got her  name from the fictional blind swordsman Zatoichi of Japanese film fame.</p>
