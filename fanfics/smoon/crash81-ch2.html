<a href="../smoon/crash81-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Legend: &quot;(...)&quot; English dialogue.

------

&quot;Malso-san, what are you doing?&quot; Yomiko asked in alarm.

&quot;&quot;You said you wanted the Knight Sabers.&quot; Jeena said, looking at the 
scared young lady in front of her. &quot;You didn&#39;t say how.&quot;

&quot;We wanted to make contact with them, not kill them!&quot; Nancy said.

Michiru closed her eyes as she began to tremble, the cold steel of the 
gun still against her head. Jeena sighed.

&quot;Look, we saw you come out of the back.&quot; she began, &quot;So stop playing 
miss innocent and just tell us where the others are. Now!&quot;

Michiru&#39;s lower lip began to quiver as tears began to fill her eyes. 
&quot;What others? I don&#39;t understand, I...&quot;

&quot;What in the hell&#39;s going on in here?&quot; a woman&#39;s voice asked.

All four women looked to the gaping opening at the front of the Silky 
Doll. There, standing outside in the falling snow, were two women and a 
pair of police officers. Yomiko recognized one of them as the crazy 
woman who&#39;d fallen off one of the flying machines.

------

Priss stepped out in front of her companions to get a better look at 
what was happening. She saw four strange women standing inside a 
partially demolished Silky Doll. As she got closer, she could see one of 
them had a gun pointed at another&#39;s head.

&quot;Someone want to explain to me what&#39;s happening?&quot; she asked, looking 
around the room. Haruka and Daley, seeing what they perceived to be a 
hostage situation, both pulled out their own guns.

&quot;Alright, freeze!&quot; Haruka yelled, &quot;Nobody moves or I&#39;ll...&quot;

&quot;Take one step closer.&quot; The woman with the gun threatened, &quot;And you&#39;ll 
be cleaning her brains off the walls.&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; the young woman wearing the glasses pleaded, &quot;Let her go. She 
obviously doesn&#39;t know anything about the Knight Sabers, or where any of 
them are.&quot;

&quot;I said drop your gun!&quot; Haruka growled. Daley looked over to Nene, his 
gun pointed at the woman in the Western wear, and sighed.

&quot;Why does this crap always seem to happen when I&#39;m around you lot?&quot; he 
asked exasperatedly. Priss put her hands on her hips and tilted her 
head.

&quot;For the last time, will someone tell me what&#39;s going on?&quot; she asked.

&quot;L... Look, I tried to explain already.&quot; The young lady with the gun to 
her head sobbed, &quot;I came here to visit my cousin Linna. She&#39;s my only 
relative, and...&quot;

SHIKKT!

Everyone looked over to see Priss, her sword unsheathed, suddenly 
looking very different once she&#39;d learned the young lady was a relative 
of Linna&#39;s. The woman with the gun looked back at her, and smiled.

&quot;Now we&#39;re getting somewhere.&quot; She said. &quot;You look like the type 
Stingray would pick for her private little war.&quot;

&quot;Let Linna&#39;s cousin go,&quot; Priss hissed, &quot;Or I&#39;ll take your other arm.&quot;

&quot;What did she tell you to get you to join?&quot; the woman asked, &quot;What 
promises? Did she appeal to your sense of duty or was it the money she 
paid that attracted you?&quot;

The woman with the glasses looked quickly around the tension filled 
room, her eyes coming to rest on a wall calendar about ten feet away. 
She slowly started inching toward it.

------

Nancy rolled her eyes. After searching for the stolen material for 
months, she and Yomiko had come to the conclusion that they needed some 
outside help. They had hoped to possibly hire the Knight Sabers&#39; 
services to assist in the recovery. Of course, after the recent events 
of today, it looked like they were already too late. The secret missing 
pages of Leonardo DaVinci&#39;s sketchbooks, particularly those connected 
with flight and flying machines, would appear to have already been used 
for nefarious purposes.

And now, when it looked like they&#39;d found someone who might be able to 
make contact with the Knight Sabers, their contact turned out to be a 
nut.

&quot;Let her go, damn it!&quot; Nancy shouted, &quot;This isn&#39;t what we wanted!&quot;

Yomiko continued to slowly make her way to the wall calendar. Since it 
was the first month of the new year, all the sheets were still on it. 
She&#39;d run out of paper earlier saving the woman with the sword, and she 
wasn&#39;t about to let the scared young lady with the violin get killed. As 
she took another step, she and the others heard a stir from the back.

&quot;Where is she?&quot; a worried voice asked.

&quot;Relax, Linna. She probably came to while we were gone and...&quot; Two women 
came out of the back. One was a European in a corset, her bustle 
swinging back and forth as she walked. The other was a young Japanese 
woman with short hair wearing a kimono. They both stopped when they saw 
the group gathered in the store. The one in the kimono allowed a gasp to 
escape when she saw Jeena&#39;s gun against Michiru&#39;s head. She was about to 
rush forward, when the other woman held her back with her arm, her eyes 
narrowing as she stared at Jeena.

&quot;Malso.&quot; She growled. Jeena smiled.

&quot;Stingray. Been a while. These your newest recruits?&quot;

The young blond on the other side of the room finally spoke up. &quot;Newest 
recruits? What are you talking about?&quot;

Jeena started to chuckle. &quot;You mean, she never told you about the first 
Knight Sabers?&quot;

Yomiko continued to slowly move forward as the woman with the sword 
crouched down, her left knee bent down in front of her and her right 
sticking back straight. She held her sword with both hands, the blade 
pointing back toward her right foot. Nancy slowly began to move her hand 
toward her petticoat.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you tell them, Sylia?&quot; Jeena asked, never taking her eyes off 
the scared young girl in front of her. &quot;Tell them about the first Knight 
Sabers. You remember, the Japanese martial arts expert and the American 
weapons specialist. Or better yet, tell them about the last mission of 
the original Knight Sabers...&quot;

The police officer with the sandy blond hair crept over a bit to the 
left, hoping to get a clear shot. Sylia continued to stare at Jeena 
through narrowed eyes as she held Linna back with her left arm.

&quot;Come on Sylia; you were there, you should remember. Tell them about the 
red Knight Saber, the one who was disemboweled by that yakuza member 
trying to save your sorry ass. Or, better yet, tell them about the 
original green Knight Saber.&quot;

&quot;Jeena.&quot; Sylia said, trying to interrupt, &quot;Don&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;You remember the green one, don&#39;t you?&quot; Jeena asked, her voice suddenly 
cracking, &quot;The one who lost her fucking arm on the mission?&quot; Turning to 
look around the room, she started shaking. &quot;I don&#39;t know what she&#39;s told 
you, any of you, but it&#39;s all lies! She doesn&#39;t care about any of you, 
only herself. Your all nothing to her but a means to an end.&quot;

Sylia now began to walk over to her, much to the blond officer&#39;s 
annoyance as it meant she would now be in the way of a clear shot.

&quot;Put the gun down, Jeena.&quot; Sylia said in a low voice. Jeena responded by 
pulling the hammer back on the colt.

&quot;Stay back, you bitch!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not going to shoot her, and you know it.&quot; Sylia said. Jeena&#39;s 
face grew red with anger.

&quot;And why&#39;s that? Because I was once one of you? Because I used to 
believe in that idealistic bullshit you used to spew all the time?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Sylia said, a slight smile teasing her lips, &quot;Because you have no 
bullets. I can see your chamber&#39;s empty from here.&quot;

Before Jeena had a chance to respond, a rapidly moving object flew over 
and surrounded her. She fell to the floor with a thud, bound up in an 
1881 wall calendar. Linna rushed over to her cousin, taking Michiru in 
her arms. The blond officer rushed forward as well.

&quot;Miss, are you alright?&quot; she asked. Michiru wiped the tears from her 
eyes with her hand as she turned away from Linna to face the officer.

&quot;Y... Yes, thank you, I...&quot; Michiru stopped as she met the officer&#39;s 
gaze. Blue eyes met the teal green eyes of the officer&#39;s, and she felt 
her heart skip a beat. &quot;Thank you, officer...&quot;

&quot;Ten&#39;ou.&quot; Haruka offered. &quot;Haruka Ten&#39;ou.&quot; She was at a loss for words 
after that. She&#39;d never seen anyone so attractive in her life. From her 
full lips to her slender neck, she was perfection itself. She could feel 
a warmth rising up within her, a longing to hold the young woman 
herself. She closed her eyes, and took a deep breath. She was a police 
officer. She was on duty. She had to remain professional.

&quot;Miss, exactly how did all this come about?&quot; she asked as Daley came up 
behind her.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid that would be our fault.&quot; A sweet sounding voice sadly said 
from the side of the room. Haruka and Daley turned to Yomiko Readaman 
and her companion.

&quot;You see,&quot; she offered apologetically, &quot;Nancy and I were trying to make 
contact with the Knight Sabers.&quot;

&quot;Well, you&#39;ve certainly succeeded at that.&quot; Sylia said, striding forward 
with her arms crossed, &quot;What do you want of us?&quot;

---Meanwhile---

Major McNichol and his men were looking around in a daze at the 
devastation. As smoke continued to billow up into the air, one of his 
men called him over. The remains of one of the machines had been found 
near a demolished clock tower. Making his way through the dead and 
debris, he reached the officer.

&quot;What do you make of it, sir?&quot; he asked. Leon shook his head.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, sergeant. It looks to be about twenty feet long maybe, 
and the pilot appears to have been killed from a gunshot wound, but 
other than that, I couldn&#39;t begin to venture a guess at what&#39;s 
happened.&quot; As he finished, the sounds of a large group of horses came 
from behind him. Turning around, he saw dozens of men, all wearing the 
same black suits and stove pipe hats, riding up silently, followed by a 
carriage with the image of a globe on the door. Coming to a stop, the 
coachman got out and opened the door. A young blond woman wearing a 
winter cloak emerged, followed by a tall man leaning heavily on a cane, 
also blond. The woman looked on silently as the man walked over to Leon, 
brushing his hair back with his hand as he did so.

&quot;Thank you, Major, for quarantining off the area.&quot; he said, &quot;We&#39;ll take 
over now.&quot;

Leon looked angrily at the man. &quot;Oh, you will, will you? And just who 
the bloody hell might you be?&quot;

The man smiled. &quot;I might be several people, Major. But it just so 
happens I&#39;m Head Librarian of British Library Special Operations, 
Section A. You may call me Mr. Joker.&quot;

&quot;Mr. Joker, huh?&quot; The Major smirked. &quot;Unless he died with an overdue 
book in his possession, I don&#39;t see what this would have to do with 
you.&quot; The gentleman&#39;s smile never left his face as he motioned to the 
young lady to come over. As she did so, she opened a case, producing two 
legal documents. She handed them to him, and he in turn passed them to 
Leon. A sudden intake of air on the Major&#39;s part notified the Head 
Librarian that he recognized the Royal Seal of the House of Windsor on 
the one document, as well as the signature of Prime Minister William 
Gladstone on the other.

&quot;You... You know some pretty powerful people, don&#39;t you?&quot; Leon managed 
to get out. Mr. Joker stepped closer, lowering his voice as he did so.

&quot;You have no idea. Now I would suggest you order your men back now, 
before things get ugly.&quot;

Leon looked indignant. &quot;Was that a threat?&quot; he asked. The gentleman&#39;s 
smile only grew wider.

&quot;You have no idea who you&#39;re dealing with, or how powerful we are. You 
could very easily find yourself on the front lines in the Boer War in 
South Africa if you&#39;re not careful, Major. Now leave.&quot;

Major McNichol stared angrily at the smiling man in front of him before 
finally turning around and ordering his men back. Mr. Joker handed the 
documents back to the woman, who placed them back in the case. They then 
both returned to the carriage, and left the rest to the men in the black 
suits.

------

&quot;We only wished to ask for your help Stingray-san.&quot; Yomiko said, 
nervously playing with her fingers. &quot;Six months ago we were dealing with 
a simple museum heist. And now, it seems they&#39;ve used some of DaVinci&#39;s 
secret papers to create those flying things. We asked for help 
contacting your organization at the British Military compound, but they 
were less than helpful.&quot;

&quot;(And let me guess,)&quot; Sylia said, addressing Jeena in English, &quot;(That&#39;s 
when they ran into you on your way here to carry out that threat of 
yours from two years ago.)&quot;

&quot;(I told you I&#39;d come back to Japan one day to kill you. Hey, if I can 
make a profit while doing it...)&quot;

Sylia turned away from her and walked over to Priss. She grabbed Priss&#39; 
dotanuki from her hands, and strode back to Jeena. Swinging the sword 
faster than most of the group gathered at the Silky Doll could see, she 
cut the calendar, allowing Jeena to escape.

&quot;(You can&#39;t have me yet.)&quot; Sylia began. &quot;(In case you haven&#39;t noticed, 
some nut&#39;s managed to invent flying machines capable of dropping 
explosives down from the sky. Once I and the others defeat them, we can 
settle this.)&quot; Switching back to Japanese, &quot;You can either join us until 
this is over, or you can wait it out.&quot;

Nene, who understood English, was incredulous. &quot;Sylia, you can&#39;t be 
serious. You&#39;re actually going to let her...&quot;

Jeena got to her feet and smiled, ignoring Nene&#39;s outburst. &quot;I think 
I&#39;ll join you for now. After all, I wouldn&#39;t want you to die before I 
can kill you. By the way,&quot; she said as Sylia passed the sword back to 
Priss, &quot;What ever happened to that young bar singer you were screwing?&quot;

Priss sheathed her sword, giving Jeena a dirty look as she did so. She 
then walked over to Linna and Michiru.

&quot;So, you&#39;re related to Linna, huh?&quot; she asked Michiru. The girl, 
intimidated a bit by the woman looking down at her, looked back to Linna 
for reassurance. Linna smiled.

&quot;Yes, she&#39;s my cousin. Her name&#39;s Michiru, and she&#39;s a violinist looking 
for work. You wouldn&#39;t happen to know any tavern singers who could 
possibly use a violin player in their band, would you?&quot;

Priss smiled. &quot;The three of us can talk about it on the way to the 
house. Unless you have any further need of us, Sylia.&quot;

Sylia shook her head. &quot;Not at all. Michiru&#39;s had a hard first day here. 
I&#39;ll update you and Linna later. In the meantime, take that poor girl 
home and get her some rest.&quot;

As the three of them walked toward the gaping opening of the Silky Doll, 
Michiru turned to look again at Haruka. Their eyes met, and Haruka could 
feel an aching as she watched the violinist leave. Daley smiled a bit as 
he leaned over to Haruka&#39;s ear.

&quot;She&#39;s pretty, isn&#39;t she?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Hai.&quot; Haruka said in a low voice thick with longing, &quot;I...&quot; she 
suddenly reddened, realizing what she&#39;d just admitted. Daley put a hand 
on her shoulder.

&quot;Relax, I&#39;m not going to ride you kid. If you&#39;re planning on pursuing 
her though, you&#39;d better figure out how you plan to explain the fact 
that you&#39;re a girl.&quot;

&quot;Oh shit.&quot; Haruka groaned. Daley laughed a bit as he led the way out, 
leaving Sylia, Nene, and their visitors behind. Nene was still trying to 
digest all that had had happened that day, and all that she&#39;d learned 
from Jeena&#39;s angry rantings.

&quot;Do we know who&#39;s behind this?&quot; Sylia asked, already having a pretty 
good idea who it was. Nancy spoke up.

&quot;We can&#39;t prove anything yet, but we suspect Genom Munitions and Trading 
International. We also have a pretty good idea of who the original thief 
might have been.&quot; she said, passing a French wanted poster over to 
Sylia. On it, the image of a man with a thin mustache wearing a monocle 
and top hat stared out, and underneath, a name was printed.

&quot;Arsene Lupin.&quot; she read. Looking back at the two agents of the British 
Library, she continued their discussion, as Nene made her way over to 
Jeena.

&quot;H... How did you loose your arm?&quot; she asked. Jeena looked her over, and 
grinned.

&quot;There&#39;s a bar nearby, kid.&quot; she said with a gleam in her eyes. &quot;We can 
discuss it over a beer.&quot;

Looking back over to Sylia, she saw her still talking intensely with 
Nancy and Yomiko. Nene turned back to Jeena, and sized her up. She was 
crazy as a loon, but she only had one arm. If necessary, Nene felt 
fairly confident she could take her in a fight. The two walked out under 
the darkening sky and quickly disappeared from view.

---The Next Day, Early Morning---

A small crowd had gathered at the landing docks, eager to see the young 
Opera singer make her arrival in Japan. Looking out from the bridge of 
the ship, Reika Chang could see the people cheering for her, as well as 
several demolished buildings. She went over again in the back of her 
mind the events surrounding her sister&#39;s death. She was murdered in a 
Buddhist temple, by yakuza. And somehow, a group of female ronin were 
involved. As she pulled her mink coat closed with one hand, she waved to 
the crowd with the other.

They would all pay, she vowed to herself. Both the gangsters and the 
ronin, she would see to that.

---To Be Continued---

Note- Arsene Lupin would of course be the grandfather of Lupin III. His 
description is based on a picture in a Lupin III manga.</pre>
