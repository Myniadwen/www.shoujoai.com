&quot;Boy, Puu sure has been acting strange lately....almost like she&#39;s 
infatuated with me.&quot; 

Artemis&#39; ears perked up, &#39;did she just say infatuated?&#39; then it hit 
him. &quot;What!&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;s always smiling around me, it&#39;s weird.&quot; 

The talking cat sighed, &#39;thank goodness, I thought...&#39; &quot;You&#39;re 
Setsuna&#39;s friend, why shouldn&#39;t she smile around you.&quot; 

&quot;Artemis, when have you ever seen Puu happy?&quot; 

He rolled his eyes, &#39;that&#39;s an easy one.&#39; &quot;All the time,&quot; he lied. 

&quot;That&#39;s sweet of you, but lets be serious, she doesn&#39;t have much to be 
happy about. Mainly Hotaro, but seeing Haruka and Michiru so happy 
every day must be horrible.&quot; 

&quot;Why would seeing her friends happy make her sad?&quot; 

&quot;Hello! She doesn&#39;t have anybody, has never had anybody.&quot; The usually 
bubbly blonde let out a quiet sob. &quot;Will never have anybody.&quot; The dam 
broke, Minako collapsed to her knees in tears. &quot;She told me that she 
would never have anybody.....ever, she even hinted that I...&quot; Minako 
shook her head. &quot;The sadness in her voice nearly killed me. I don&#39;t 
want her to be alone, I don&#39;t want to be alone. In fact, as the 
Goddess of Love I won&#39;t allow it!&quot; The blonde practically flew to her 
feet, all tears forgotten, and flashed the V symbol. &quot;I&#39;m tired of 
hiding my own feelings and I will not let Setsuna be alone any 
longer.&quot; 

Artemis was starting to sweat. &quot;What are you, ah, talking about 
Minako?&quot; 

The blonde tilted her head to the side. &quot;I&#39;m going to tell her how 
much I love her of course.&quot; 

&#39;Ahhhhh nuts! This isn&#39;t good at all.... I&#39;d better tell Luna.&#39; 

*****Setsuna*****

Setsuna suddenly got very dizzy. &#39;The Timeline, why can&#39;t I see the 
Timeline?&#39; She was a little surprised when everything snapped back 
into focus. &#39;What the hell was that?&#39; 

******Ami*****

&#39;How do you tell your best friend something like this?&#39; the blue 
haired genius thought as she watched the tall brunette prepare their 
lunch. She could picture the scene in her head, causing her blush to 
deepen several shades. 


---------------------

&quot;So, what should we have for lunch today,&quot; Makoto happily announced 
from the kitchen. After hearing no response she returned to the living 
room. &quot;Ami are you.....oh my!&quot; Ami was lying on the couch, wearing 
nothing but an embarrassed smile. &quot;Beautiful, so beautiful,&quot; Makoto 
breathed the words, causing Ami&#39;s blush to deepen. &quot;Ami, I could.... 
never if you didn&#39;t...&quot; 

&quot;I love you Mako, I love you so much it hurts not to be with you. I 
want you to make love to me....I need you to make love to me.&quot; Tears 
appeared in Makoto&#39;s eyes, she said nothing as she undressed and made 
her way to the couch. &quot;Thank you.&quot; Ami was a little surprised when 
Makoto lifted her into her arms. &quot;Mako, what are you...&quot; 

&quot;Not out here, this needs to be special.&quot; She walked her beautiful 
bundle down the hall to her, no, to their bedroom. &quot;I love you too 
Ami, so much that it kills me not be with you.&quot; She placed her blue 
haired angel on the bed and lay down on top of her, their lips meeting 
for the first time. Their bodies melted together as their tongues 
danced in each others mouths. 

Ami brought her hands up and placed them on Makoto&#39;s ample chest. She 
delicately took the, ever hardening, rosebuds in-between her fingers 
and gave them a slight pinch. Makoto moaned into Ami&#39;s mouth before 
pulling away from the kiss and wrapping her lips around Ami&#39;s throat. 
She sucked and licked her way down to the blue haired girls smaller, 
but deliciously perky chest. 

Makoto was a little surprised when Ami placed her hands on the back of 
her head and pulled her down onto her breast. Makoto took the 
invitation and sucked hungrily on the small mound. Ami was moaning and 
bucking her hips whenever teeth were grazed across the sensitive 
nipple. She could feel her sex practically dripping with lust as the 
tall girl ravaged her chest. She wanted to do a little pleasing. 

With strength she didn&#39;t know she possessed she flipped the brunette 
over onto her back. Instantly placing a large breast in each hand and 
latching onto the taller girls throat. She pinched both nipples and 
bit down, not enough to break the skin, but more then enough to make 
her scream with pleasure. Her knee was placed up against Makoto&#39;s sex 
and she could feel exactly how much she was enjoying this. 

Ami yelped lightly when she felt a finger slide into her dripping 
pussy. Makoto began to slide the finger in and out at an agonizingly 
slow pace. Ami finally regained her senses and pushed two fingers 
in-between Makoto&#39;s burning lips. There bodies and tongues were 
grinding together as they pressed into each other. 

&quot;Ohhhhh God, Mako. I&#39;m so hot.&quot; 

Low moans came in response. Their fingering had reached a furious 
pace. The slurping of creamy fluid joined the moans that filled the 
room. Any second they were going to..... 

&quot;Ohhhhh I&#39;m gonna!&quot; 

&quot;Makooooo! 

Their bodies shook with orgasm, writing together, coating each others 
hand with hot girl cum. Their lips met once more, screaming with 
unimaginable pleasure into each others mouths. As the last 
contractions started to fade they began slowly rubbing each others 
burning centers. 

&quot;I love you Ami. Now and forever.&quot; 


---------------------

&quot;Ami are you all right, I asked what you wanted for lunch. You&#39;ve been 
zoning out a lot lately, is everything okay. 

&quot;It will be soon Mako-Chan.&quot; &#39;As soon as I tell you how much I love 
you.&#39; 

*****Makoto*****

&#39;Ami sure has been acting strange lately.&#39; A horrible thought struck 
her. &#39;What if she knows! Knowing her she&#39;s known all along. I&#39;m not 
going to hide it any longer! I&#39;m going to tell her, sometime soon.&#39; 
Her mind made up she went into the kitchen to make lunch. 

*****Setsuna*****

The green haired women suddenly collapsed to knees, struggling to 
breathe. The Timeline seemed to stretch then contract, out of control. 
After a few seconds it returned to normal. &#39;What&#39;s happening.&#39; 

*******Rei******

&quot;Ohhh why is this so hard!&quot; a very frustrated Rei shouted at the walls 
of her room. It had been 1 very agonizing month since she discovered 
Mamoru&#39;s scheme. She had returned to the park every week at the same 
time, only to discover that this was a regular hobby of his. He was 
cheating on Usagi with a new girl every week and Rei had the pictures 
to prove it. She wanted, no she needed to tell Usagi but it would 
break her heart. It didn&#39;t help that she was always fawning over the 
bastard whenever he was around or mentioned. 

&quot;Worthless....destiny!&quot; she spat out the word. Destiny was doing a 
very good job of ruining her life. The great Neo-King Endymion was 
nothing but a cheating piece of shit. Destiny was by far the biggest 
obstacle for Rei&#39;s plans. Rei could hear Luna&#39;s voice in her head, 
&quot;Neo-Queen Serenity and Neo-King Endymion must be married in crystal 
Tokyo. The Moon and Earth Kingdoms must be united or evil will destroy 
the universe,&quot; Rei definitely didn&#39;t want that to happen. But she 
didn&#39;t want to see Usagi marry that scumbag and spend the rest of her 
life being lied to and cheated on. Usagi had to know but Rei didn&#39;t 
have the heart to tell her about him. Then there was the whole thing 
about telling her of her own feelings. 

&quot;Oh hi Usagi. Mamoru&#39;s doesn&#39;t love you and he&#39;s cheating on you. Oh 
and by the way I&#39;m so in love with you that it hurts not to hold you 
in my arms.&quot; Rei rolled her eyes. &quot;Yeah that would be a great way to 
break the ice,&quot; Rei stated sarcastically. &quot;Look at me, I&#39;m talking to 
myself, I&#39;m driving myself crazy over this. I should just tell her 
about that jerk, I know it will hurt but.... no I can&#39;t hurt the 
princess like that.&quot; Just thinking about her princess&#39; heartache 
brought tears to Rei&#39;s eye&#39;s. Of course, Usagi cried all the time like 
when she fell or Rei teased her really bad but it wasn&#39;t real. Those 
tears were nothing compared to the ones shed when she was really 
upset. Come to think of it, Rei had only seen Usagi that upset when 
Mamoru dumped her or caused a fight. 

The fire appeared in Rei&#39;s eye&#39;s. Mamoru was always hurting Usagi and 
it had to stop. Rei was going to put her plan into action. In two 
weeks Usagi would find out exactly what Mamoru has been doing. Rei&#39;s 
feelings for her would have to wait. Even though she wanted nothing 
more then to hold the beautiful blonde in her arms. To hold and kiss 
and make love to her princess was Rei&#39;s only dream. She loved both 
Usagi Tsukino and Sailor Moon and wanted to be by their side forever. 
Well, maybe her second dream was to slowly burn that bastard to death, 
Mamoru or Tuxedo Kamen. Yes, she would start her plan the very next 
day. 

******Luna******

&quot;Why are you so happy?&quot; Luna questioned the practically dancing 
blonde. 

&quot;I have a date with Mamo-Chan tomorrow! Oh my life is so perfect, I 
have a wonderful boyfriend who I&#39;m destined to marry. I have seen what 
the future holds for me, I have a wonderful husband and beautiful 
daughter. My friends are all with me and protecting me. I know that 
everything is going to be perfect so why shouldn&#39;t I be happy. 

&#39;Why is this so difficult?&#39; &quot;Um Usagi, the future you saw isn&#39;t for 
sure what&#39;s going to happen,&quot; Luna said quietly, Usagi stopped dancing 
around and stared at the cat. 

&quot;What do you mean Luna?&quot; The blonde asked, tilting her head to one 
side. 

&quot;Well....the future you saw is only what could happen, not what will 
happen.&quot; Seeing the completely blank look on the blonde&#39;s face the cat 
explained. &quot;Listen, if the future you saw was for sure going to happen 
then you could walk into every battle knowing that you would come out 
alive and that just isn&#39;t true, you could die in any of them. Do you 
understand what I&#39;m saying?&quot; 

&quot;But what about Chibi-Usa, she&#39;s here right now, she&#39;s asleep in the 
next room for crying out loud.&quot; 

&quot;Well, I can tell you that Chibi-Usa will be born but.... &#39;Why me?&#39; I 
can&#39;t tell you, you&#39;ll just have to wait and see.&quot; 

&quot;Darn it, how can you say something like that and not finish it!&quot; 
Usagi wailed then began muttering something about the lousy timeline. 

&#39;How do you keep so many secrets Setsuna, I would go crazy if I were 
you.&#39; 

&quot;I&#39;m going to sleep, I got a date tomorrow.&quot; 

*****Setsuna*****

&#39;So lonely,&#39; Setsuna sighed as she sat at the end of her bed, idly 
kicking her legs. Minako had left hours ago, having finished modeling 
the clothes Setsuna had presented her with. &#39;Why is destiny so cruel 
to me?&#39; Knowing the future and what it held for her left her in a very 
deep slum. She had nothing, she had nobody. Nobody to come home to at 
the end of a busy day. Always waking up cold and alone....forever. 

Most of the Senshi would eventually try and fail to gain the love of 
another. Even the two of them that already were together would 
eventually be broken by destiny. Sadly, Rei would never even try to 
find love, slowly withering away inside. Setsuna really hated her job, 
being privy to the future was a real downer. 

She had been spending as much time as possible with the bubbly blonde 
but she knew it was hopeless. The timeline simply wouldn&#39;t allow her 
to have anyone. No matter how much she cared for them. She didn&#39;t even 
know how the infatuation had started. One day she simply saw the 
beautiful blonde in a new light. What she wouldn&#39;t give to hold her in 
her arms, to kiss those lips, to....


&quot;Setsuna-Mama what are you thinking about?&quot; the 14 year old Hotaro 
asked, bringing the Senshi of Time out of her &#39;thoughts&#39; 

&quot;Love,&quot; Setsuna stated before she could stop herself. She had been 
paying less and less attention to the time stream lately. To be 
honest, she really didn&#39;t care to know what was going to happen. She 
looked at her young daughter sadly. She too was doomed to a loveless 
life. All of the Senshi were in fact, barring Usagi of course. Only 
the Moon princess would get to be with her true love. That fact really 
pissed off the Guardian of Time. 

&quot;Don&#39;t you already know who you&#39;re going to love in the future?&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t have anyone to love in the future,&quot; she stated sadly. 

Hotaro looked horrified. &quot;You mean that you never....have 
anyone....ever?&quot; the smaller girl asked quietly. 

&quot;No, and neither do y....&quot; She just barely stopped herself in time. 
&#39;If she knew about her future......she might not want to live it.&#39; She 
put on her best fake smile. &quot;Sorry, I&#39;m just rambling. It&#39;s getting 
late, you should get some sleep.&quot; &#39;I&#39;m so sorry Hotaro, but destiny 
sees it fit to crush all of our loves before they can even begin.&#39; 

&quot;Oh. Okay, good night.&quot; 

&quot;Good night Hotaro. 

Setsuna waited until the girl was gone and dropped her smile. &quot;I hate 
my life.&quot; She stared at a spot on the wall for what seemed like ages 
until she heard Hotaro shout something. Seconds after the shout a 
sharp pain settled in her head once again. This time however, her 
vision of the timeline left her completely, almost like it wasn&#39;t 
there anymore. &quot;Wha....what the hell is happening!&quot; 

*****Hotaro*****

Hotaro was crying into her pillow. &#39;I&#39;m always going to be alone. But, 
I always hoped that....I would be with...&#39; &quot;No!&quot; she shouted sitting 
up and yelling it to the walls. &quot;I have been alone long enough!&quot; She 
slumped back into the pillow, her sobs returning. &quot;I will be with you 
my love.....my beautiful Chibi-Usa.&quot; She cried until she was taken 
into her dreams, into the arms of her wonderful pink haired goddess. 

*****Chibi-Usa*****

&quot;Mama, are you asleep?&quot; &#39;Darn it! I shouldn&#39;t have said the M word.&quot; 

Before Chibi-Usa could react Usagi, completely naked, was out of bed 
and had her locked in a back breaking hug. &quot;You called me mama, that 
makes me so happy!&quot; She released the pink haired girl and gazed 
happily at her. &quot;What&#39;s the matter, did you have a nightmare?&quot; She 
seemed totally oblivious to her nudity. 

&quot;No, I wanted to ask you about something.&quot; 

&quot;What is it?&quot; 

The little girls cheeks turned as pink as her hair. &quot;Love.&quot; 

Usagi let out a high pitched squeal. &quot;Tell me everything. Who is he? 
What does he look like? How old is he?&quot; Chibi-Usa said nothing, she 
simply stared at her slippers ashamedly. &quot;What&#39;s wrong? Did I say 
something to upset you?&quot; 

&#39;What am I supposed to say? How can I tell her that I love my best 
friend.....a girl! This is so frustrating! Why can&#39;t I just tell 
her...&quot; The instant Chibi-Usa started to cry Usagi gathered her into a 
tender hug. &quot;I....I love.....&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s okay sweetheart, you can tell me anything.&quot; 

&quot;Mama. I love Hotaro and....I think she loves me too.&quot; Usagi froze. 
Mind, body, and soul--she froze. Chibi-Usa could feel the change, felt 
the warm hug grow cold. &#39;What have I done?&#39; &quot;What&#39;s wrong Mama? Did I 
do something wrong? Is there....something wrong with me?&quot; This snapped 
Usagi back to her senses and into tears. 

&quot;No sweetheart. There&#39;s nothing wrong with you or Hotaro. If the two 
of you make each other happy then there is absolutely nothing wrong. I 
love you no matter what.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you mama.&quot; 

&quot;Besides,&quot; Usagi giggled. &quot;The two of you are so Kawaii together. Have 
you kissed her yet?&quot; 

&quot;USAGI! How could you ask that! And would it kill you to wear 
something to bed!&quot; 

*****Rei*****

The Next Day 

&quot;Don&#39;t cry my pri... Usagi. How about we go do some shopping, just the 
two of us,&quot; Rei asked the distraught blonde. Mamoru had, of course, 
canceled a date with Usagi at the last minute, ditching the crying 
bundle of beauty in Rei&#39;s arms. 

&quot;You really want to Rei,&quot; Usagi asked with tears and hope in her 
eye&#39;s. &quot;You&#39;re always so mean to me, why are you being so nice?&quot; 

&#39;Because I love you,&#39; &quot;Because you&#39;re my best friend. Don&#39;t take me 
seriously when I tease you Usagi it&#39;s all in good fun. I would never 
do anything to hurt you. Now how about we do some shopping, I heard 
there is a great new shoe store opening at the mall.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you so much Rei,&quot; Usagi sobbed as she buried her face into 
Rei&#39;s shoulder. 

&quot;Anything for you princess,&quot; Rei said as she held Usagi close, lightly 
stroking the smaller girls back. &#39;God she smells nice,&#39; Rei thought as 
she pressed her face into the silky blonde tresses. Before she 
realized what she was doing she planted a tender kiss on Usagi&#39;s 
forehead, causing the blonde to back away with a confused look on her 
face. &quot;Shall we get going,&quot; Rei stammered out quickly, trying to cover 
up her mistake. Luckily it worked, Usagi nodded and the two left the 
Shrine for the mall. 

The whole time they were shopping Rei treated Usagi like a queen. 
Always complimenting and making her laugh. About halfway through their 
shopping Usagi took Rei&#39;s hand and kept it there for the rest of the 
time. Rei was treating Usagi how she deserved to be treated. Always 
showing love, support, and respect. She couldn&#39;t help but naturally 
insult Usagi when they ate lunch but it was all in good fun. Usagi was 
shocked when Rei even offered to pick up the rather large check for 
her meal. Rei was showing Usagi how good it would be with her instead 
of Mamoru. 

After another 2 weeks of this she and Usagi would be closer then ever. 
It would be easier to tell her about Mamoru and about how she felt. 
Everything was going perfectly, she was going to beat Destiny. She had 
even figured out a solution to the Moon Kingdom/Earth Kingdom problem. 

They were at the park, having decided to go for a walk after their 
shopping trip. 

&quot;Thank you so much Rei, I really needed this and I love spending so 
much time with you.&quot; Usagi slammed into Rei and hugged her tightly. 
Rei wrapped her arms around the slender blonde and held her close. She 
once again lost control and kissed Usagi on the forehead. 

&quot;I love you my princess,&quot; Rei whispered under her breath so Usagi 
wouldn&#39;t hear. 

&quot;What did you say?&quot; Usagi asked as she broke away from the embrace. 

&quot;Nothing,&quot; Rei answered before looking up at the sky. &quot;It&#39;s getting 
late, I should walk you home.&quot; 

Usagi looked down at her shoes, &quot;Um could sleep over at your house. 
Chibi-Usa is staying at Hotaro&#39;s and my parents took Shingo out of 
town. I really don&#39;t want to be alone right now.&quot; Rei couldn&#39;t believe 
her luck. 

&quot;Of course you can stay with me. Any time you want for as long as you 
want. You can stay with me forever Usagi.&quot; Rei said as she took the 
blonde&#39;s hand and led her toward the Shrine. 

*****Hotaro/Chibi-Usa***** 

The two girls lay in Hotaro&#39;s bed, both of the &#39;supposedly&#39; sleeping. 
Little did they realize that they both had the same plan in mind. As 
soon as the other was asleep they would &#39;innocently&#39; roll over and 
wrap an arm over the other. In the morning they would wake up staring 
into each others eyes. Their lips would meet and they would hold each 
other close. 

It came as a bit of a shock when they met in the middle. 

*****Usagi*****

&#39;Why is Rei being so nice to me, she&#39;s usually so mean. We&#39;re always 
fighting about something but now she&#39;s so sweet. It&#39;s almost like 
she.....! No, Rei isn&#39;t like that....is she? Does she like me....like 
that? What about those kisses, or the way she holds my hand. No! She 
is just being friendly. We are best friends after all.&#39; Usagi nodded 
her head and pushed those thoughts from her mind. She was having fun 
with her best friend, she couldn&#39;t start thinking like that. 

Although she did feel a little guilty about going to Rei whenever she 
had a fight with Mamo-Chan. Rei was always there with open arms and 
comforting words. Come to think of it Usagi hadn&#39;t been spending any 
time with Mamo lately. He had canceled every date and fought with her 
constantly. It was almost like he didn&#39;t love her anymore. That was 
impossible though, they had seen the future and they were married. 
They even had a child, so they had to be together. &#39;The soul bond is 
there, I can feel it....wait, no I can&#39;t! It isn&#39;t there! How can that 
be possible?&#39; Luna&#39;s words entered into her mind. (The future you saw 
is only what could happen, not what will happen). &#39;Oh my God!&#39; 

*****Artemis*****

The bubbly blonde was dressed in full ninja gear as she climbed from 
the window of her room. She was too preoccupied to notice the gleam of 
cat eyes in the darkness. Artemis had decided not to tell Luna. That 
decision could very well change the future but as it stood he didn&#39;t 
like that future one bit. The Senshi, while appearing to be happy, 
were miserable and lonely. He wouldn&#39;t allow it. 

&#39;Time to throw two stones at one bird, as Minako would say. She&#39;s 
going to get rid of both of your problems at once. You had better be 
ready Puu, the Goddess of Love has her heart set on you.&#39; 

*****Rei*****

&quot;There you go Usagi,&quot; Rei said as she finished preparing the spare 
futon on the floor of her room. Usagi looked at the futon, then at Rei 
before blushing brightly. &quot;What is it Usagi?&quot; Rei asked the bright red 
blonde. 

&quot;Um I was wondering if..... I could sleep with you Rei.&quot; Rei was 
stunned, why would the gods tease her like this. They were giving her 
everything she wanted but couldn&#39;t have. 

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t that be a little awkward Usagi. I know that neither of us 
wear any bedclothes.&quot; Rei&#39;s heart was beating a mile a minute in her 
chest. &#39;Please say it doesn&#39;t matter. Please say it doesn&#39;t matter.&#39; 

&quot;That&#39;s okay, I just don&#39;t want to be alone,&quot; Rei was soaring, she was 
going to sleep naked with the most beautiful creature on this planet. 
&#39;Just one of the perks of friendship I guess.&#39; 

&quot;Anything for you princess, anything,&quot; Rei said as she stripped off 
her clothes and lay down on her bed. She watched in open mouthed awe 
as Usagi took off her own clothes and walked over to the bed. She was 
the picture of perfection, long blonde hair, bright blue eyes, sexy 
body, perky breasts, God she was beautiful. Rei could feel her arousal 
growing between her legs and in her nipples. This was going to be a 
long night. 

*****Usagi*****

&#39;What am I doing?&#39; Usagi thought as she took off her clothes and 
slipped into bed next to Rei. &#39;I&#39;m lying naked next to my best friend, 
that&#39;s all. It&#39;s not like we haven&#39;t seen each other naked before. I&#39;m 
just depressed over Mamo-Chan and don&#39;t want to sleep alone.....wait a 
minute. I never slept with Mamo-Chan, near him or with him. So why 
would I want to sleep with Rei?&#39; Usagi looked over at Rei, she was 
still awake. &#39;She has been acting different, and not just today 
either. All month she has been acting weird around Mamo and me. She&#39;s 
been extra nice to me and all cold to him. I wonder what&#39;s wrong?&#39; &quot;Um 
Rei?&quot; 

&quot;What is it Usa.&quot; 

&#39;Usa?&#39; &quot;I was just wondering why you have been acting so different 
lately. To me and Mamo-Chan.&quot; Rei cringed at the mention of his name. 

&quot;I told you, were best friends...&quot; 

&quot;Tell me the real reason.&quot; 

*****Makoto*****

&quot;Sooooo, what did she say?&quot; 

&quot;My Mom says that it&#39;s okay if I stay here for the night.&quot; 

&quot;Yes!&quot; 

&quot;You know Mako. It is pretty late, we should get some sleep.&quot; &#39;Time to 
make my move.&#39; 

&quot;I&#39;ll....prepare the couch for myself. You&#39;re the guest so you can 
sleep in my bed.&quot; &#39;Stop being such a coward Makoto. Make a move&#39; 

&quot;Ummmm....maybe we could...share the bed.&quot; &#39;Please say yes.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;d love too.&quot; &#39;I can&#39;t wait any longer, I&#39;m telling her tonight.&#39; 

They walked side by side, a little closer then usual, into the 
bedroom. 

*****Setsuna*****

Setsuna was wobbling around the room, hoping to regain her balance or 
grab onto something. Apparently the later came true and she latched 
onto to something that felt like a pile of cloth that was just a 
little shorter then she was. 

&quot;Setsuna, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; 

She would know that voice anywhere. &quot;Mina, what are you doing here?&quot; 
At the sight of her Goddess, the pain in her head faded away. 

&quot;I came to tell you something. I think we both know what it is.&quot; 
Setsuna burst into tears and collapsed into the blondes arms. 

&quot;Don&#39;t leave me Mina. I know I&#39;ve been acting strange lately but...&quot; 

&quot;Why would I want to leave you when I&#39;ve finally found 
something...someone so good?&quot; 

&#39;What!&#39; 

*****Rei******

&#39;Damn it princess why are you doing this? What do I say?&#39; &quot;You deserve 
to be treated this way.&quot; &#39;What am I doing?&#39; &quot;It&#39;s obviously not 
important enough for Mamoru to do it so I am instead. You don&#39;t 
deserve what he does to you Usagi, you deserve better. He treats you 
like dirt so I treat you like a queen.&quot; Tears appeared in Rei&#39;s eyes. 
&quot;You deserve so much better princess. So much better then that 
bastard&quot; The tears began to fall. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t even be with him Usa 
he doesn&#39;t love you. I....&quot; &#39;What should I say?&#39; 

&quot;What is it Rei? Please tell me.&quot; 

&quot;I...&quot; 

*****Usagi*****

Thoughts were flying through her head like crazy. She could picture 
all the strange and not so strange ways that her friends had been 
acting lately. It seemed that all of the Senshi had the same idea in 
mind. 

Haruka and Michiru were....well, Haruka and Michiru. They would always 
be together. 

Ami and Makoto were spending every free second together, always as 
close as possible to touching. She had caught them staring at one 
another more times then she could count. When she really looked at the 
two of them they were perfect for each other. They would make a 
beautiful couple someday. 

Minako and Setsuna had been inseparable as of late. Always modeling 
clothes or simply talking each other. It was good that both of them 
had somebody to be with. Despite Mina&#39;s popularity, she could be as 
lonely as Setsuna sometimes. They could end both of their loneliness 
in one shot. 

Even her own daughter and Hotaro had found a beautiful Senshi to share 
their love with. They were so Kawaii together. She should have noticed 
it sooner. 

She should have seen them all coming. Now that they were actually 
happening all of it was so obvious.....so very obvious. 

She looked deep into Rei&#39;s eyes, brimmed with tears. That was when she 
finally saw what had been right in front of her the whole time. It was 
love. Rei was in love with her. Unconditional love for her princess. 
It must have hurt so much to hide that love, keep it buried under 
shame and fear. Seeing that love awakened something that had been 
inside her all along. Something that simply needed a little push to be 
set free. 

&quot;I love you Usagi! I...know you don&#39;t love me back....and even if you 
did, I could never do that to Chibi-Usa. I&#39;m so sorry to put this on 
you but I can&#39;t live this lie anymore. I love you Usagi and even if 
you don&#39;t love me I will always love you.&quot; Rei couldn&#39;t hold her teary 
gaze anymore and turned her head. 

&quot;I love you too Rei!&quot; 

*****Mamo-Baka*****

&quot;My....spell....broken.&quot; He collapsed to his knees. 
&quot;Back....to....nothing.&quot;
