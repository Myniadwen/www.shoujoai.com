<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fair Game<br />
</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was an anchovy crammed in among tens of thousands of her kind.</span></p>
</span><p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  own small school crushed in around her, the familiar voices of Usagi,  Makoto and Ami joined with the excessively loud screaming and  chattering of the teens and twenty-somethings that had filled the  stadium to its capacity. Normally, tight spaces and large crowds caused  Rei a great amount of anxiety, but the anxiety she felt now wasn’t  associated with her surroundings at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The lights darkened and  the stage in the middle of the arena was swathed in shadow as the  canned beat in the background slowly faded. The crowd suddenly surged,  their voices swelling to a decibel that Rei wondered how one human  voice, even amplified, could possibly be heard above the din.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But she knew Minako’s could.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  was teasing her fans, milking that tense moment before her appearance,  feeding off their anticipation – and no one contributed to that  anticipation more than Rei herself, who hadn’t even realized she’d  stopped breathing. The ache she’d held in her heart all week, knowing  Minako had been in town, but needing her space to sort through her  memories, to sort through her feelings, had forced her to keep her  distance. Not to mention the fact that she certainly hadn’t trusted  herself to seek out the object of her confusion... but now, all Rei  wanted in the world was to simply see Minako again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally, a  bright light erupted from the center of the stage, a driving,  electronic beat pulsated through the stadium, and then, heralded by the  voice that had gathered such an amazing crowd, Aino Minako hit the  stage, launching into a track from her latest album.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei was  suddenly grateful that their seats, though close enough to the stage to  offer a perfect vantage point, weren’t too close to front row. From  behind the screen of about twenty rows of fans, the miko felt she could  gape at the idol in unadulterated glory, for Minako’s onstage persona  never ceased to amaze her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But regardless of that untouchable  appearance; from the singer’s intricate costume, which consisted of  form fitting white vinyl booty shorts and vest, to the stage makeup  that amplified her beauty for even those at the back of the stadium to  see, to the rainbow of flashing lights that pulsed to the rhythm of her  voice, underneath it all, she was still Aino Minako, their stubborn  leader and her best friend. No matter how famous she was, or how  stunning she looked, she was still her Minako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Her</em> Minako?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  tore her gaze from her best friend to stare at her hands sheepishly.  Had she become so comfortable with her feelings for the other woman  that she could honestly consider such a thing?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Daring a glance  back at the singer, looking at her from just the right angle, Rei’s  train of thought was derailed; for she was shocked to find a Minako she  hadn’t expected. Despite the energy of the song she sang, regardless of  her animated dancing and emotion filled voice, the smile that Minako  wore didn’t quite seem to reach her listless eyes. For one who had been  so enthused about reaching out to others through her music, Minako  seemed terribly tired.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei hadn’t the time to dwell on that  thought any longer, because when the idol turned, a subtle act that  hadn’t seemed premeditated to any but Rei’s eyes, the miko got the  feeling that Minako was looking for something. No… searching for <em>someone</em>.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And those caramel eyes stopped wandering when they found Rei’s.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even  from fifty feet away, through of sea of people, tens of thousands of  fans shouting for her attention, screaming her name, Minako had found  her best friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I’m overanalyzing.’</em> Rei said to herself, even as she remembered to breathe. <em>‘I’m sure every person in this half of the stadium thinks she’s looking at them, stupid.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  then the singer raised her hand to the crowd, her index finger pointing  outwards, and this time Rei knew Minako’s actions, easily confused for  part of the choreography, weren’t meant for the crowd in general. They  were meant for her. She was pointing that delicate finger at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At  a loss, Rei frowned, and she knew it had been her petulant response  that had caused the idol’s glassy smile to spread into a full blown  smirk, and a glimmer of true emotion finally reached those tired  caramel eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With an honest grin, Rei found herself returning  the gesture, and for that one moment, the only two living souls in the  entirety of the stadium, in the entirety of the world, were Minako and  herself. And when the singer had decided she’d neglected the rest of  her fans too long and trotted to the other end of the stage, Rei found  herself missing her best friend’s attention.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But the song was  pulling to a close. Its driving beat slowed, was mixed against a tamer  beat with a more melancholy sound that mingled harmony with melody, and  finally, Rei identified the track as an old standard from her second  album, Katagoshi ni Kinsei. It was such a ridiculously obvious song,  considering Minako’s senshi powers, yet it was one of Rei’s favorites.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Before daybreak, in the clouds on Venus, the two of us found each other.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And as her object of attention sang, Rei felt glued to her words, for suddenly, it felt like Minako was singing <em>to</em> her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Our secret love that we couldn’t share with anyone, will it vanish softly into the sky?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And as Rei listened to the lyrics, to the emotion behind them, <em>really</em> listened for the first time, she began to doubt the wonderland  simplicity of the song being based off of a fictional situation. And  although the song could have meant almost anything, with her newfound  memories rising to the front of her mind, the miko was suddenly aware  of the double meaning that might apply to <em>her, </em>to the Reiko of  the past and her relationship with Venus Minako. She found herself  hoping her suspicion might be correct, but every time Rei looked to the  stage, searching for acknowledgement, she found Minako to be avoiding  her gaze.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Awkwardly, these fleeting emotions will also be reborn in the future.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Suddenly, Rei didn’t know which Minako she was hearing – Venus Minako or Aino Minako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Has  anyone ever told you what an amazingly beautiful voice you have? Reiko  asked, snuggling her head on her partner’s lap. She was met with a  tentative chuckle. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>If I tell you something, will you promise not to laugh?” Minako cautioned. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The raven haired woman’s eyes squinted. “Of course.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I… always wanted to be a singer.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Eh?”  Reiko asked, trying to picture her stubborn commander as anything other  than the seemingly single minded leader of the senshi. “Hmm,” she  warmed up to the idea, “Venus Minako, interplanetary pop star…”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Mars Reiko, you promised!” The Venusian Princess turned her nose to the air and affected a genuinely hurt expression.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Reiko grabbed her partner’s clasped hands and smiled up at her. “I’m not teasing you. Can’t you take a compliment?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You… think I have the talent?” Minako asked uncertainly.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Of  course!” Reiko enthused. It wasn’t like Venus not to have the utmost  confidence in herself, and she wanted to urge her partner not to let  her dream go, no matter how impossible it was given their duties. “Sing  me something.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>A slight blush covered the senshi of love’s cheeks. Reiko smiled and closed her eyes, waiting.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>On  our morning walks, we always held hands/ I won’t forget that since  someday, you’ll hold me close to you/ Because I’ll love you forever/  Perhaps we can find a new love, looking at Venus.” </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Suddenly,  the senshi of fire couldn’t breathe. She was a million miles, a million  years away, yet she was still herself, hearing the same song, the same  words, from the same voice. Minako was calling to her, but she wasn’t  answering. Why wasn’t she answering? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Reiko! Reiko, answer me!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Mars  gasped painfully and she tore herself out of her frightening  premonition, and found herself back in her familiar room, her head in  Minako’s familiar lap. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei didn’t know how long she was out  of it, but when she could finally feel herself again, the familiar  sound of Katagoshi ni Kinsei had been replaced by another song off  Minako’s latest album. She was too shocked, too confused to place its  name, but that was the least of her worries.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reiko had known back  then. She’d had a premonition that she’d ignore Minako’s call in a  different place, a different time. Had Minako been calling out to her  through her music for the past five years and she’d been too deaf to  hear her, to really <em>hear</em> what she was saying?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  searched the stage and found her best friend, bouncing and singing and  motioning to her fans, her microphone in the air as she effortlessly  reached a particularly tough note. But she could read that tense body  language, the apprehension in every movement that mimicked that which  Rei felt. And as she watched, the miko knew, Minako had been dealing  with the same feelings all along for the past five years.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  this time, when those caramel eyes turned back towards her, they held  Rei in place, as though she’d known what the other woman had been  thinking, and this time, the miko’s world did stop. Motionless in a  turbulent world where everything was too loud, everyone was too close,  Rei was suffocating.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m going to be sick.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?!” Usagi shouted dumbly with a wide smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei raised her voice only slightly, her eyes lost. “I said I’m… not feeling well. I have to go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei-chan!” Ami and Makoto called out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  the miko had already squeezed herself between the rows of fans and  seats that had held her captive and was making her way towards the  exit. And although she was entirely too conscious of Minako’s gaze on  her, watching her leave even as she continued to sing, for all her  confusion, all her fear, Rei couldn’t turn around to face her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>This is always the worst part.’</em> Minako lamented, that empty space after a concert when the fans have  left, her manager was passed out on the couch of her dressing room, her  adrenaline had worn off, and she was left with nothing but the  relentless pounding of the road crew disassembling the stage.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Heading  for the parking garage, the singer walked the bowels of the stadium on  autopilot, her exhausted mind jumping from thought to thought  incoherently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It had been good to see the girls backstage, but  Minako hadn’t had the patience for playing hostess very long,  especially given Rei’s absence. Usagi had assured her that the miko had  felt ill and had gone home, but she knew the truth. It had been all  Minako could do to maintain her composure when she’d seen Rei leave the  concert, and it had taken all she’d had to keep from running after her  mid-song.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What had upset Rei so terribly? Perhaps she’d finally  understood the real meaning and the feelings she’d weaved into her  songs and was running away, repulsed?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Though she had finally  reached the exit, Minako paused mid stride and leaned a shaky hand  against the cold cinderblock wall for support. She felt sick. What had  she done?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where to, Aino-san?” It was her driver who had pulled her car up to meet her that yanked the singer from her thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Home,  please.” She barely managed as she fumbled with the door and collapsed  into the rear seat. Though she’d never considered the rented space as  her home, her apartment was the only place in this city she had left to  go.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She leaned her clammy forehead against the tinted glass of  the back window, her eyelids slowly shutting as they wound around the  ramp of the parking garage before bursting into the brightly lit neon  colored night of Tokyo. She squinted when the flashes of cameras held  by hopeful fans assaulted her, but before her eyes slowly shut for  good, she saw one thing that brought her exhausted body back to life.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She</em> was there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Standing  behind the crowds, her chin buried in her wool jacket in an attempt to  keep warm, Rei was waiting for her. And Minako latched onto that small  shred of hope she always carried, for if Rei had stayed behind, perhaps  things couldn’t have been as bad as she’d feared.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pull over.” She demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her driver caught her gaze from the rear view mirror quizzically. “Excuse me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Drive away from the crowd, pull over and let me out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But, Aino-san-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just do it!” She barked, her commanding nature taking over to suit her needs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  zipped her puffy parka up to her chin and pulled the brim of her  baseball hat down to further conceal her identity. Having driven a  sufficient distance to throw off her fans, she dashed out of the car  and made her way back to stadium parking lot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">From a distance,  the singer stood watching but quickly realized that her best friend was  no longer where she’d last seen her. Minako smirked. It meant that Rei  wanted the idol to find her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Perhaps my plan hasn’t backfired at all.’</em> She decided. For, in the past, she hadn’t been the only one to play the  mouse, and she was perfectly content to play the cat, so long as Rei  was her prey.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She found her just a couple blocks away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slightly  out of breath, having run the whole way, it was all the singer could do  to master her cool sense of calm when she saw the miko, illuminated by  the faint light of a waxing quarter moon. Sitting patiently on a wall  that bordered a small park, Rei’s feet dangled a few inches from the  sidewalk, and when coupled with her wrinkled brow that spoke of  confusion, only enhanced her youthful image.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There were too many people in there for me, I-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  okay,” Minako offered, seeing that her friend was having trouble  expressing herself, and not wanting to get her to flustered… yet, “I  understand. Sometimes the crush of people gets to me, too, and I’m  supposed to be used to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko offered the idol a thankful  smile, and a small amount of tension was released from her posture. “I  still don’t know how you do it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako shrugged and, with an  effortless hop supported by her right hand to spin her body around,  joined Rei on the wall. “Sometimes, I don’t know how I do it either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Catching  the look of concern the other woman gave her, a look that told her that  her best friend might have seen more than she’d wanted her to, Minako  decided to steer their conversation in a more important direction. “So,  did you miss me last week?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This earned a willful snort from the miko, who crossed her arms over her chest indignantly. “Don’t flatter yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  quiet air was laced with gentle laughter and the two women sat shoulder  to shoulder in silence. The heels of Minako’s sneakers bounced  playfully against the wall as she fought the pull of the hypnotizing  headlights that danced off the hedges thrown by the traffic in the  distance. Meanwhile, Rei stared at her hands. For as much as she simply  wanted to bask in the comfortable position she’d found herself in, she  was unsure of what to say, feeling that any explanation of her emotions  would be inadequate to explain how confused she felt, how very on the  edge she was between pulling her best friend closer to her, and simply  pushing her away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think I-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This past week I-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  two chuckled somewhat awkwardly, and before they could get caught in an  endless cycle of ‘you go first,’ Rei beat the singer to the punch.  “Please, go ahead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako smiled softly and rested her hand  lightly on Rei’s thigh. “It’s late, and it’s cold. Why don’t we go back  to my place and-“ Minako could feel the miko’s muscles quivering under  her hand. “Rei?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The raven haired woman finally looked her best friend in the eye. “You were right. My past is returning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The singer fought back a gasp at hearing the one thing she’d waited to hear for what had seemed like endless years. “Then you-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  forged forward, feeling that she had to get this out now or she’d never  say it at all. “And I’m sorry that… you’ve been calling to me all this  time and I’ve never really listened until now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>An apology?’</em> Minako asked herself with wide eyes. The miko never apologized! The singer’s mind raced and got the better of her. <em>‘Could Rei and I be on the same page after all this time?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s voice was a whisper. “Reiko…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!”  Rei severed eye contact with her best friend, her voice hoarse. She  slid off the wall, standing shakily on feet that threatened to run. To  hear Minako call her by her past incarnation’s name was too much for  her. It was cracking her defenses, and she knew that if she wasn’t  careful, she’d give in to desires that she didn’t fully understand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No… don’t call me that,” Her voice was a pained whisper, “please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Seeing  Rei so fragile, and only wanting to comfort her, Minako pushed her  luck. Sliding quietly off the wall, she stood in front of her best  friend and slowly reached out to her. Rei refused to meet her eyes,  even when the warm skin of Minako’s hand cupped her chilled cheek, but  the singer couldn’t help but smile softly as the miko leaned into her  touch.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei stood frozen, her dark eyes clouded with an obvious  mixture of doubt and desire, but Minako advanced ever so slowly, until  their breath mingled together in the cold night air. With Rei’s head  titled to the left, Minako’s titled to the right, it felt like they  stood there forever; both the cold and being out in the open forgotten  as each of them waited for the other to make the next move.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  miko shivered, and that very action nearly caused their lips to touch,  but it was enough to break her from her trance. No matter how much she  wanted to kiss her best friend, she was still afraid. She had grown  considerably more comfortable with her feelings for her Minako, but she  needed more time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Just a little more time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei stumbled  backwards, and seeing the hurt, the disappointment, in Minako’s caramel  eyes, she clutched her hands to her chest for fear that her heart would  leap from it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Wide eyed and unable to think of a single thing to say to redeem herself, Rei simply turned and ran.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The singer wasn’t sure how long she stood there after the miko had fled, but she didn’t really care.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally,  her criteria had been met. After five long years, Rei was fair game and  she was now free to pursue her. Between her words and her actions, the  miko had told her everything she wanted to know without her actually  saying it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She’d regretted scaring Rei, pushing her over the edge  like that and causing her to run away, but she didn’t regret her  actions. Just like Mars Reiko, Hino Rei would return to the flame like  a moth, just like she used to when they had been senshi years ago.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yet,  she had seen the worry, the fear, in the miko’s dark eyes - the sign  that she was still coming to terms with what she’d learned and how she  felt. Minako remembered having gone through that awkward phase, alone  and afraid five years ago. She wanted to be there for her best friend,  but knowing that she was the cause of those emotions, she acknowledged  that it would be a careful balancing act on her part.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But worst of all… now that Minako had finally held Rei so close, she felt terribly lonely in her best friend’s absence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  chill ran down Minako’s spine, no doubt a combination of the cold night  air and the intensity of her feelings. A quick check of her watch  snapped her back to reality. Her alarm clock would be ringing in only a  few hours.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With a smile, Minako took to her heels, heading  towards her apartment with a bounce in her step. After all, regardless  of her worries, the singer had a lot to look forward to, for starting  tomorrow, Hino Rei was fair game.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Authors notes:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ah  hah, sorry for the tease with Rei running away, but you know the wait  will only make it that much sweeter. Stick with me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Regarding  my translation of the first verse of Katagoshi ni Kinsei; you might  notice it’s just a little different than most translations you’ve seen.  I’ve only studied Japanese for about three years, but this is the way I  read the passage, and I’m sticking to it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Preview, Chapter 7:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer grinned evilly. “While ‘A Day in the Life of Minako’ may have  been an interesting diversion, don’t think I’ve forgotten our purpose  here. Just because my work interrupted our day doesn’t mean you’ve  gotten off the hook for last night. You still have some explaining to  do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei snapped her mouth shut, suddenly finding the sidewalk  much more interesting to look at. But she managed to quell the  butterflies in her stomach. She was ready for this. Being like this all  day; being with Minako, sharing, learning, she felt she’d been given  what she needed to feel comfortable with taking the chance of letting  Minako get closer to her. She finally knew it would be okay to let this  one woman, who meant so much to her, close to her heart.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And when she’d gathered the courage to look back into Minako’s eyes, she realized something else, first. <em>‘When did we start holding hands?’</em> She wondered, for Minako’s fingers no longer gripped her jacket sleeve, but were laced between her own fingers snugly.</span></p>
