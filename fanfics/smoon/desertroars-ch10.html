<h1>And the Desert Roars (part 10 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/arashi.html">arashi-enkou</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/desertroars-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Ami closed her eyes as she felt tendrils of magic whip and lash at her 
face, Makoto&#39;s arms surrounding her like a big, warm blanket.

&quot;Where are we?&quot; Ami shouted over the rush of magic and time. Makoto said 
nothing, only tightening her grip on Ami possesivly. Taking that as a 
sign to, &#39;Shut-up, or we die.&#39;, Ami closed her mouth and simply enjoyed 
the feel of weightlessnes that was found in this odd void. The sight of 
the two bodies, Rei and Usagi, drifted into her mind and tears spilled 
from her eyes again. Her heart ached and every beat of it sent small 
daggers throughout her body.

&#39;What if that&#39;d been Makoto and I?&#39;

She didn&#39;t dwell on that thought.

After an eternity of drifting in the sea of time, Ami felt gravity take 
over and her feet cushioned by cold sand. She blinked and gazed up at 
what she&#39;d thought had been a temple.

&quot;Oh my stars in Heaven,&quot; she whispered in awe.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Makoto chuckled. &quot;It is pretty somethin isn&#39;t it?&quot;

The palace was golden, a jewel in a lifeless desert to be sure. But as 
the moon climbed to its peak in the midnight sky, Ami remembered why 
they had come here in the first place. &quot;Makoto, we need to find them!!&quot; 
she gasped. Makoto grabbed the blue haired woman&#39;s hand and concentrated 
on Usagi&#39;s energy signature. With a flash, they teleported to where 
Usagi&#39;s energy was strongest.

:::---:::

&quot;I hate you!&quot; Rei roared even as Jadeite, one of Endyimon&#39;s most trusted 
bodyguards bound her wrists in chains. &quot;I&#39;ll hunt you down and tear out 
your heart Endyimon! Mark my words!! I&#39;ll hunt you down to your last 
descendent!&quot; Jadeite yanked harshly on the chains, a reprimad that made 
Rei&#39;s blood boil.

&quot;Such fire,&quot; the blonde man chuckled as he ran a finger down Rei&#39;s 
cheek. The girl growled and bit the man&#39;s finger, not letting go even 
when the coppery taste of blood filled her mouth. He shrieked and 
something slammed into Rei&#39;s back, making her gasp in pain and realease 
Jadeite&#39;s finger.

&quot;Disgusting wench!&quot; Jadiete spat, holding his bleeding digit away from 
the girl. She smirked and sneered, &quot;If you can be brought down by a bite 
to the finger, I&#39;d hate to see you in battle with an armored warrior!&quot;

Zoisite laughed until a few tears slipped from his eyes, obviously 
enjoying his comrade&#39;s humiliation. Nephirite snorted back his laughter. 
Kunzite&#39;s face didn&#39;t even twitch.

Enyimon chuckled. &quot;I&#39;ll give you a choise. Be one of my warriors and 
give up Usagi.&quot; He crouched until he was nose to nose with her. &quot;Or 
suffer my curse. What will it be?&quot; Rei&#39;s answer was to spit blood mixed 
with saliva at his eye. Endyimon snarled and yanked her up by her hair.

&quot;A foolish choice!&quot; he hissed. Rei stared him down. &quot;I&#39;ve made many 
foolish choices in my life Endyimon,&quot; she began. &quot;I&#39;ve made so many 
mistakes; I have so many regrets.&quot; Her voice was getting stronger with 
every word. &quot;But the greatest choice in my life was to be with Usagi. I 
would not change that for the world!&quot;

Endyimon chuckled and drew the scimatar from its sheath. &quot;Brave words 
for the dead.&quot; He raised the curved sword high in the air. As he swung 
down he snarled out, &quot;Die!&quot;

A hand shot out and grabbed the Pharoh&#39;s wrist, tightening to a vise 
before flinging him back to hit a wall. The black haired man grunted in 
pain and slumped to the floor. Rei was hauled to her feet by a smirking 
Makoto. &quot;Still need me to save your life?&quot; the brunette said to her 
desert sister. Rei growled and drew the scimatar from the scabard, 
turning to face Jadiete. A small smile spread across her face as she 
felt the familiar warmth of her long time partner at her back. Jadeite 
snarled a curse and grabbed a spear with a long, curved blade at the 
tip. He twirled it expertly, the shaft of wood appearing a blur. Makoto 
crackled her knuckles and raised her fists at the battle ready Nephrite.

&quot;Just like old times eh?&quot; Makoto threw over her shoulder.

Rei allowed a small grin. &quot;Just like old times.&quot; With that, she charged 
towards Jadeite. The blonde man smirked and thrusted forward. The raven 
haired girl flipped over the spear and twisted in air to land behind the 
guard. But her plan backfired as Jadeite swung the spear around in a 
horizontal slash that would have split her had she not sucked in her 
stomach as far as it would go. Rei dropped to the ground and swung out 
her leg, only to have Jadeite jump over it and raise the spear over his 
head, bringing it down with a mighty cry. She leaped to the side and 
rolled to her feet, barely managing to block the spear&#39;s blade as it 
crashed against her own. Icy blue met firey violet.

&quot;You would have made a wonderful bride.&quot; Jadeite smirked. Rei growled 
and a flash of crimson sparked through her eyes.

&quot;Only in your fantsy!&quot; She roared, allowing herself to be pushed to the 
ground. She slammed her feet into the man&#39;s stomach, lifted him over her 
head and sensing him flying into to rack of spears, head first.

She allowed the sickening squelches and the sound of his pained shrieks 
to guage the effectivness of her move.

&quot;Jadiete!!&quot; Nephrite screamed. He rushed to his comrade&#39;s aid, only to 
be stopped by a quick punch to his jaw by Makoto. He slammed into the 
wall and slid to the ground. The brown haired man turned to his other 
comrades. &quot;Pleae! Kunzite! Zoisite! Help him!&quot; he pleaded. Zoisite 
shrugged his shoulders. &quot;It was his own folly to underestimate the girl. 
The Master cannot be protected by a fool.&quot;

Kunzite closed his eyes and said a brief prayer to the gods for his 
comrade&#39;s soul. Zoisite noticed this and gently ran a hand through his 
lover&#39;s silver hair. &quot;He shall be avenged.&quot; the slightly feminine man 
said to the stoic general. &quot;Now that that&#39;s out of the way,&quot; Zoisite 
stepped up to face the desert child. &quot;I belive I shall end this 
quickly.&quot; He reached into the pounch at his side and withdrew a handfull 
of pink flower petals.

&quot;Prepare to die!&quot; He screamed as he flung them at Rei. Warning bells 
rang in her head and Rei dived to the side. Makoto noticed this and 
laughed. &quot;C&#39;mon Rei, you scared of a few petals?&quot;

&quot;Look closer fool!&quot; Rei snapped. &quot;Do you not recognize the flower for 
what it is!?&quot;

Makoto blinked and turned her gaze back to the flower petals. She gasped 
as the spot where Rei had just been began to melt.

&quot;The Poison Lotus,&quot; Makoto hissed. Rei cursed savagely under her breath. 
&quot;It seems like the game has just begun.&quot; the desert child murmured.</pre>
