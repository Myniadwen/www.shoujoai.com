<p><em>Just  in time for it to register that Minako was there, in person, in the  flesh, right in her face.</em></p>
<p><em>The latter  didn't truly register until she had tried to sit up quickly in her  startled surprise...</em></p>
<p><em>And ended up  getting retro CPR from a very wide-eyed idol.</em></p>
<p><em>Goodness  knows, Rei's students were certainly surprised.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Hey,” one whispered in  the silence that followed, “I thought they said they </em>weren't <em>lovers?”</em></p>
<p>Minako instantly  pulled away, turning to face away from everyone, her cheeks bright  red.</p>
<p>Rei did the same, in  a different direction, her hand clamped over her mouth.</p>
<p>Perhaps it wasn't a  complete coincidence that at that moment, both Minako and Rei thought  the same thing. <em>Her lips are so soft... but that hurt my teeth.</em></p>
<p>“Rei-chan!  I didn't know you and Minako-chan were so close!”</p>
<p>The blood quickly  drained from her face as she recognized the voice, realizing that the  owner had just caught her at the worst possible time. <em>Never say  worst, Rei; you're just tempting Fate that way.</em> She bolted  around, glancing at Minako on the way as she defended, “We aren't!  It was an accident! Geez! Why is everyone barging into my room again!  That's the second time <em>today</em>! Sakura!” The girl 'eep'ed. “I  told you that key was only for emergencies!”</p>
<p>The girl looked like  she was just about ready to cry. Rei didn't fall for it; when  pressed, Sakura could fool almost anybody- besides Rei that is.  “B-but... your friends are here... Rei-sama... and I didn't know  where you were... we looked all over... and you weren't answering...”</p>
<p>“That's  no excuse! M-makoto and Usagi have been here before. They do not go  under the term 'emergency' unless one of them is somehow in extreme  pain, and that does not seem to be the case here.”</p>
<p>Makoto had scooted  the other students off and away before she came back, snickering. “Aw  come on, Rei-chan, let off on the girl, huh? Today's Minako's Welcome  Back celebration. Punishments and anger can wait until later, right?”</p>
<p>Rei was still red,  more from embarrassment than anger. To be caught sleeping... while  having those dreams... having <em>that</em> sort of wake up call... how  could anyone expect her to just 'let it go'? She shook her head as  she got to her feet. Absurd... absolutely absurd... why were Makoto  and Usagi even meeting <em>here</em> of all places anyway? She hadn't  been informed of this...</p>
<p>“Rei-chan?”</p>
<p>Rei flinched as  Minako called her. The dreams were still vivid in her mind, despite  the distraction. “Sakura. You're dismissed. Finish your assigned  duties and then head home for the weekend.” Sakura eyes widened.  Just before she could affirm it, Rei reassured her, “Make no  mistake; when you and the others come back, you <em>will</em> be  punished for this misdemeanor.”</p>
<p>Sakura bowed and  quickly scurried away. Makoto whistled. “Geez, you sure are harsh,  even now, Rei. Ever think of lightening up?”</p>
<p>Rei scoffed as she  moved to fold up the futons so there was more room. “Who planned  this anyway? Meeting up here?”</p>
<p>Minako smiled  nervously at her and scratched her cheek with an apologetic look.</p>
<p>Rei glared at her.  She then sighed and resumed her chore. At that moment, she realized  that Usagi was being too quiet, especially for her, which prompted  another head turn.</p>
<p>She didn't think it  was possible.</p>
<p>Usagi was actively  looking between Rei and Minako and actually appeared to be...</p>
<p>Dare it be said...</p>
<p>Thinking. <em>Deeply.</em></p>
<p>Rei only wished she  had chosen something else to think about. For the record, she wished <em>she </em>could think of something else, too.</p>
<p>Minako helped her  put away the other futon and as they were leaving them in the closet,  Makoto having simply leaned against the doorframe watching Usagi, the  girl suddenly called out, “I got it!”</p>
<p>Her audience of  three waited with trepidation.</p>
<p>“Minako  slept over last night, right?”</p>
<p>The silence was  deafening. Like an applause... except the exact opposite.</p>
<p>Makoto was the first  to speak. “That was what you were thinking about all this time?”</p>
<p>“Ah...  did you already know?”</p>
<p>Makoto sighed. “And  here I'd been hoping for something revolutionary.”</p>
<p>Rei mimicked the  action, adjusting the placement of the table. “That's Usagi for  you. Sees two futons, already knows students aren't even allowed in  here, knows none of the others have been here recently, and takes ten  minutes to come to that conclusion. Stop hanging around the door and  giving students peeping shields. Come sit, and lock the door behind  you. I'll make some tea. What kind do you guys want?”</p>
<p>Makoto, suddenly  remembering, held up her occupied hand. “Oh, that's right! I  brought pastries! I think they'll go best with... hmm... Rei-chan, do  you have green tea still?”</p>
<p>Rei looked at her  stores, found the container for aforementioned green tea, and looked  inside. “Umm... one more round only. Geez, I thought I'd gotten  enough of that...”</p>
<p>Usagi bounced around  the room, as it had been all of four months since she had last been  inside Rei's room, and she was eager to see if she could exploit any  other secrets- said action being the reason why most meetings had  kept to the living room area before today.</p>
<p>“Hey  so Minako, when exactly did you come back?” Makoto leaned forward  with a grin.</p>
<p>“6:23  last night if Usagi's clock was right and it was a live broadcast.”</p>
<p>Makoto and Minako  blinked. Minako whispered, “Rei-chan you... you paid attention to a  detail like that?”</p>
<p>Even Usagi had  stopped to listen to Rei's answer.</p>
<p>Rei sighed as she  turned around from her mini fireplace that was now boiling water. She  noticed where Usagi was. “Usagi! What are you up to now!”</p>
<p>The girl squeaked,  much like Sakura had, and slipped into place beside Makoto, who  lightly papped her on the head with her knuckles.</p>
<p>The fire priestess  exhaled deeply, leaning against the dresser behind her. “Don't get  any ideas. Usagi made me stay until the program was over and I was  glancing at the VCR clock every so often anyway when the interruption  came on.”</p>
<p>Usagi pouted,  remembering. “They didn't even rewind... I missed the good part!”</p>
<p>Rei rolled her eyes.  “It was about Minako coming home! Are you saying that some stupid  TV show is more important than our own idol?”</p>
<p>Minako felt a  strange sensation tickling at her sides at the sarcastic question.  She grinned. “Rei-chan thinks I'm that much more important then? I  never would have guessed...”</p>
<p>Rei glared at her,  though without really trying. “You of all people know how annoying  I find TV.”</p>
<p>Minako nodded, as if  she had expected this. “But then why did you let Usagi talk you  into staying?”</p>
<p>As the tea kettle  called to her, Rei was unable to stop the fiend in time before it (it  being Usagi) answered, a finger pointing upwards in tune with her  grin, “Ah, that's because I said Rei-chan could use my TV to watch  her new Minako Aino music video!”</p>
<p>“USAGI!”</p>
<p>And just like that,  Usagi clapped both hands in front of her mouth. “Oops! I forgot I  wasn't supposed to say anything! Sorry, forgive me, Rei-chan!”</p>
<p>Rei sighed,  returning to the kettle, knowing it was already too late. She'd been  had.</p>
<p>“Rei-chan,  why didn't you tell me you were a fan?” Minako pouted for a moment,  and then she knew what it was. “Oh come now, it's not that  embarrassing to you, is it?”</p>
<p>“No  comment.”</p>
<p>Usagi grinned like  she knew a secret that everybody else didn't, and Rei caught it  before Usagi could hide it. “U-sa-gi. Open that big mouth of yours  again like that and I'll be sure to throw something extra hot into  it.”</p>
<p>“Rei-!”  Usagi pouted, and then sulkingly nodded. She then remembered,  “Pastries! Give it here, give it here!”</p>
<p>“Hold  on, Usagi! Ami said she'd be right over!”</p>
<p>Rei blinked, somehow  having forgotten Ami's absence as she was almost as hard to grab hold  of for long as Minako. “Ami's coming?”</p>
<p>Makoto nodded.  “Yeah. Oh, Rei- are all the students going home tonight?”</p>
<p>Rei slowly nodded.  “That's what they always do...”</p>
<p>Makoto affirmed, “So  it's just us here, right?”</p>
<p>Again, Rei nodded.  “They usually clear out by six. Why?”</p>
<p>Makoto whistled  innocently. “Oh, no reason, really.”</p>
<p>Usagi whined,  “Food...?”</p>
<p>“Just  a little longer!”</p>
<p>“Well,  the tea's ready anyway.” Rei set the tray on the table. Everyone  took the cup nearest to them, adding sugar as desired, which, for  Usagi, meant three, four teaspoons at <em>least</em>.</p>
<p>Minako prompted, “So  anything interesting happen that I haven't heard about?”</p>
<p>Usagi instantly fell  into place. “Ooh, ooh, Minako-chan, did you know? My neighbor's cat  had kittens and I got to keep one!”</p>
<p>Minako blinked.  “How's Luna taking it?”</p>
<p>Usagi grinned. “I  think she's jealous since I'm paying more attention to the kitten  than her.”</p>
<p>Makoto  raised an eyebrow. “Really? Last I heard, she said it was a relief  that you don't spin <em>her</em> in circles anymore.”</p>
<p>Minako blinked, her hand unconsciously  moving to her mouth. “Usagi-chan... you're spinning a living  breathing kitten around in circles? Doesn't it scratch you for that?”</p>
<p>Usagi chuckled  nervously. Rei shook her head. The girl was hopeless. Period. There  was just no helping it.</p>
<p>All of a sudden,  Rei's private line went off. She stood up and walked over to answer  it.</p>
<p>“<em>Rei-chan?”</em></p>
<p>“Ami?”</p>
<p>Rei noticed the  discreet movement of Makoto perking her head up.</p>
<p>“<em>Is Makoto there by any chance?”</em></p>
<p>“Um... yes... was there something you  wanted to talk with her about?”</p>
<p>“<em>Yes, actually. Can you put her on  for me?”</em></p>
<p>“I guess... Mako-chan! Ami wants to  talk to you.”</p>
<p>“<em>Thank you, Rei-chan.”</em></p>
<p>Rei shrugged as she  handed Makoto the phone, sitting back down next to Minako.</p>
<p>“What's up, Ami?”</p>
<p>“<em>Ahm... I'm kind of held up at the  moment...”</em></p>
<p>“Are you going to be later than you  thought?”</p>
<p>“<em>Yes... but on the plus side, I  already stopped by at Uncle's place like you wanted me to. I'm  bringing your favorite one.”</em></p>
<p>Makoto grinned.  “The big one?”</p>
<p>Ami chuckled on the  other end. “<em>Yes, Mako-chan. 'The big one.'”</em></p>
<p>“Okay. Anything else?”</p>
<p>“<em>Umm... is there enough room for a  sleepover? What about the students?”</em></p>
<p>“Still worried about that? The rooms  are all free- students go home for the weekend apparently. When do  you think you'll get here?”</p>
<p>“<em>I see... I guess there's really  no helping it then. Let's see... it's almost two now... there was a  big accident so there's a lot of sudden patients... I'll call again  when I'm done?”</em></p>
<p>“Okay. We'll be waiting.”</p>
<p>“<em>Ahm... for Usagi's sake, you can  start eating without me. Just... if she eats them all...”</em></p>
<p>Makoto grinned,  whispering into the phone. “I know, I know. We'll arrange the usual  if that happens.”</p>
<p>“<em>Okay then... I should get going.”</em></p>
<p>“Mmk. Bye, Ami-chan.”</p>
<p>“<em>Bye.”</em></p>
<p>As they both hung  up, Makoto set the cordless phone on the table. “Well, good news  and bad news. Ami-chan's gonna be really late, but we can start  eating.”</p>
<p>As Usagi cheered,  Minako and Rei finished exchanging glances. Minako grinned.</p>
<p>Makoto nervously  opened the bag, the fresh smell wafting out, straight into Usagi's  awaiting nose. “What's with that look?”</p>
<p>Minako fixed her  elbow on the table, setting her chin in the palm of her hand. “You  know, I don't think I saw that when I was here last.”</p>
<p>Rei confirmed, “It  wasn't there then.”</p>
<p>Makoto watched them  watching her, suddenly very uncomfortable. She presented food to  Usagi as a visual distraction. “What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Minako, once-vessel  for the Senshi of Love, smiled mysteriously. “You ever notice how  there's a softness in her eyes when she talks to Ami-chan?”</p>
<p>Rei nodded  seriously, fighting a grin of her own.</p>
<p>Makoto was trying  to deny it. “What are you talking about? Ami-chan's my best friend!  Geez, what are you trying to imply to a married woman?”</p>
<p>Minako continued,  apparently not caring. “Come now, Mako-chan, we've all known each  other for a long time, right? Fought monsters and doomsday prophecies  together. It won't even have to leave this room.”</p>
<p>Rei nodded again.</p>
<p>Usagi was in  heaven, munching on a strawberry cream puff.</p>
<p>Makoto shook her  head vigorously. “You're imagining things. Drop it!”</p>
<p>Minako paused to  consider it, and then shrugged. “Your move, Kino. Now then,  Rei-chan... just how much of a fan are you of me <em>really</em>? I  suddenly have the feeling you're my number one fan.”</p>
<p>As the spotlight  abruptly changed course, Rei cringed. Usagi pouted. “I'm  Minako-chan's number one fan! I claimed it first!”</p>
<p>Minako giggled.  “Okay, Usagi-chan. Rei still seems high up on that list... isn't  the shampoo in your bathroom the very one I personally endorsed?”</p>
<p>Rei cringed again,  taking a gulp of her tea as she fought down a blush. She couldn't  deny it... she <em>knew</em> she'd forgotten some little detail or  something...</p>
<p>“I bet the reason you always turn  down my offers for free merchandise is because you already have it,  don't you?”</p>
<p>Rei grumbled, “I  told you I'm not into the media, or TV, or merchandise, or any of  that stupid stuff. That shampoo just happens to smell good.”</p>
<p>Minako blinked, and  then grinned. “How do you know I really endorsed that shampoo?”</p>
<p>Rei blinked,  realizing she'd been tricked again. She lamely explained, “Usagi  said so in one of her rants... and I saw it in the store.”</p>
<p>It wasn't a lie...  just not the whole truth either.</p>
<p>Hours passed like  so, tossing in random current events, teasing of suggested affection,  rumors courtesy of Usagi, political happenings via Rei, copied  easy-1-2-3 recipes from Mako-chan's kitchen.</p>
<p>After a call from  Ami saying she was on her way, they stopped once again on Mako-chan's  more-than-friendly hints toward Ami instead of her husband.</p>
<p>They were quite  obviously on a high sugar rush, as well as that of reunion-related  euphoria, considering more than one round of Tickle Monster had been  unleashed.</p>
<p>As Mako-chan went  down under three bodies, six hands, sixty tickling fingers, she  finally called out for mercy.</p>
<p>“All right, all right! I'll say it  okay! I've fallen in love with Ami-chan!”</p>
<p>The tickling  stopped... the three assailants looked at each other, not sure what  to do. They hadn't actually expected her to say it. A part of each of  them hadn't even believed it to be true.</p>
<p>Just then, they all  heard it.</p>
<p>The distinct sound  of footsteps at the door, fading away slowly... before seeming to  pound against the wood, the owner running away from the scene.</p>
<p>Makoto's eyes  widened, her lips whispering a single name before she scrambled up,  despite being out of breath, running up to unlock the door and  chasing after the distant silhouette.</p>
<p>“Ami-chan!”</p>
