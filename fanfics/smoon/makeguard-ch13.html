Makoto woke several times in the hours after Ami left her. During those 
moments she would lie awake in the silent darkness of the room, a dull 
ache along her arm, with jumbled thoughts running through her head. 
Fragmented dreams wove the nights events in a confusing pattern. When 
she tried to grasp things that she&#39;d dreamt about only minutes before, 
the thoughts alluded her. Others lingered on the edge of her memory, 
keeping her from sleep. In one, she walked through a crowd of faceless 
people, but not completely faceless. Some of those faces she recognized. 
Music echoed in the distance and couples danced, as though unaware of 
her presence. Did they not see her? Then she was pulled away again. It 
was Michiru, like before. Though, she wasn&#39;t wearing the same dress from 
the ball that night. She was wearing a different one. They walked out 
onto the balcony, that suddenly was not the balcony, but her own room, 
back on Ganymede. Here they stopped, and Michiru kissed her. This time, 
though, was different from the balcony. This time Makoto knew what to 
do, if only for the fact that it was Michiru guiding her. She watched 
from within her own mind as she did something that she could not fathom. 
It wasn&#39;t anything unpleasant, nor was it totally unknown to her, but 
she&#39;d never expected that she would carry out such actions. Surprising 
as it was, Makoto found it even more shocking when she pulled back and 
held, not Michiru, but the Princess of Mercury in her arms. Fear shot 
through her like lightning, followed by panic and a sensation akin to 
falling rapidly. Things blurred and she was jolting awake, her body 
tense and hot. She threw the covers off of herself and lay staring at 
the ceiling, letting the air in the room cool her skin. Makoto stayed 
that way for a few minutes until she finally relaxed, drifting back into 
sleep.

Finally, the usual dreams began. He was there with her in these dreams. 
The man she was destined to kill. The traitor who killed her parents. 
He&#39;d come to them as an escort, an ally in service to the Queen. A 
General. Evidently the Queen did not know her subordinate as well as she 
should have. He was such a coward, using sly means and trickery to bring 
about her parents&#39; end. Her father did not receive a warriors death, for 
he never got the chance to fight back. In her dreams she killed this man 
in many ways, over and over again, every night. One day, she would find 
him, and on that day, he would die by her hands. That was her only 
objective, and no one would get in the way.

Makoto did not know what time she awoke that morning, but she did know 
that her arm wasn&#39;t bothering her as much as it had yesterday, and that 
she wasn&#39;t going to stay in this room any longer than she needed to. 
Opening her eyes, she rolled onto her side and was alarmed to find 
someone sitting by the bed, silently watching her. They stared at one 
another for a moment or two before the other spoke.

&quot;Feeling any better?&quot; Michiru asked with a smile.

&quot;Like new.&quot; Makoto answered.

&quot;That&#39;s good.&quot;

There was silence again as Makoto watched Michiru, waiting for her to 
speak again. Michiru sat comfortably, her hands resting in her lap, a 
pleasant smile on her face. Makoto tried to remember her dream, looking 
hard at Michiru, but she couldn&#39;t conjure up any clear images. The 
blue-eyed guardian tilted her head in an amused fashion, looking 
inquiringly back at Makoto.

&quot;What are you waiting for?&quot; she asked, leaning forward to push some of 
Makoto&#39;s hair out of her face. It had come loose during the night and 
lay cascaded across the sheets and pillows, showing just how long it had 
gotten since the last time they&#39;d met. At the touch, an image flashed 
through Makoto&#39;s mind, one of Michiru performing the same actions as she 
just had, only she was not beside the bed, but in it, hovering over 
Makoto with a totally different expression gracing her features. As the 
vision faded, Makoto sat up slowly, still staring at the woman before 
her. There was a question in her eyes.

&quot;You weren&#39;t very talkative then either. You always wait for everyone 
else to speak. I&#39;m sure that you have plenty to say. Why will you not 
let others know you?&quot; Michiru let her hand fall away from Makoto&#39;s face. 
&quot;I&#39;ll tell you why. You&#39;re afraid.&quot;

Makoto looked incredulously at Michiru now. &quot;Afraid of what?&quot; She 
croaked. &quot;You? You act as if you know me. You stayed in my castle for a 
while, but that means nothing.&quot;

&quot;I know you more than anyone does right now.&quot; Michiru stated seriously. 
&quot;And it&#39;s your own fault. Because you were so afraid.&quot;

Makoto shook her head, &quot;I&#39;ve got no idea what you&#39;re talking about and, 
frankly, I don&#39;t care.&quot;

Michiru stood suddenly, anger flashing in her eyes, &quot;Then remain ever 
the ignorant fool, Makoto. Always putting up that barrier and keeping 
people at arms length. Well, it&#39;s time to grow up. You are a spoiled, 
selfish, arrogant little girl who has had her way for the past thirteen 
years. You are weak. Weak of mind and heart.&quot;

Makoto opened her mouth to reply, but evidently could come up with 
nothing to fire back at the woman. Shutting her mouth, she ended up 
providing a cold glare as her only answer to Michiru&#39;s statements.

&quot;But I have seen such potential in you, Makoto.&quot; Michiru&#39;s voice 
softened. &quot;I&#39;ve broken through your shell and seen what you spend every 
day trying to hide. You hold it back, not allowing it to interfere with 
your quest for vengeance.&quot;

Makoto looked shocked at that last part.

&quot;Yes, you told me of your plans for revenge. You told me many things.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about? I&#39;ve never told you anything.&quot; Makoto 
swore.

&quot;I took your memory away from you.&quot;

&quot;You what? How is that possible? And if it were, why would you do such a 
thing?&quot;

&quot;Because you told me to.&quot; Michiru said as she sat back down. &quot;You were 
so distraught over certain...things, and we were not really ourselves. I 
guess we were both afraid.&quot;

&quot;How much did you take away? I can&#39;t imagine anything that I&#39;d allow to 
be erased from my memory.&quot;

Michiru gave an ironic sort of smile, as if she found her statement 
funny. &quot;Only about a days worth of memories, when you add the hours up I 
guess. It&#39;s not really erased, and has been in your mind all along. I&#39;m 
assuming that ever since you arrived on the moon, you&#39;ve been having 
strange thoughts or memories. Maybe you even dreamed something odd?&quot;

Makoto nodded.

&quot;It would take several more months for you to totally regain your lost 
memories, for I made the time limit around a year or more, just in case, 
though I did not tell you this. I am not always in the safest of 
situations, and if I died before returning the memories, then you would 
never get them back.&quot; Michiru leaned forward on her knees. &quot;Have you 
ever gone into a room, knowing that you came to that room to get 
something, but you can&#39;t remember what it was? Still, you know it was 
something that you needed. Then you go back to the place where the 
thought first struck you that you needed that particular thing, hoping 
that it might help you remember. So it is with your memories. It&#39;s like 
you are stepping back into that place where the thought first came to 
you. I am that place Makoto. You have been gradually remembering on your 
own. But I wonder if you&#39;ll still want those memories after they are 
returned.&quot;

&quot;I want them back.&quot; Makoto said urgently. &quot;I can&#39;t stand not knowing.&quot;

Michiru nodded. &quot;I will give them back in time. Give it a week. You need 
to adjust to life here on the Moon, then I&#39;ll give you the memories 
back. I&#39;m think that you can handle them now, and perhaps they will make 
your stay more interesting.&quot; Michiru smiled mysteriously.

Makoto was frowning. &quot;The Moon, or Jupiter, it shouldn&#39;t matter. What 
could be so difficult for me to handle?&quot;

&quot;You certainly were distraught over a year ago, and I was fool enough to 
believe that I had done something wrong. Now I realize that neither of 
us did anything wrong. It is just what happens when you are left alone 
for so long. It breeds fear and despair.&quot; Michiru stood, pulling the 
chair back to the table.

&quot;You puzzle me Michiru. Why are you here on the Moon?&quot; Makoto stood as 
well, looking for her clothes.

&quot;I was invited of course,&quot; she smiled.

&quot;What race are you? I don&#39;t recognize your accent, though I wouldn&#39;t 
really know either way I guess.&quot;

&quot;I am Neptunian.&quot;

&quot;Really? I&#39;d never met a Neptunian before, or a Mercurian...or a 
Martian...&quot; she trailed off, thinking.

&quot;Makoto, I think it is time I told you. You are not very observant, do 
you know that?&quot;

Makoto drew her brows together in question. &quot;Though some have said the 
same, it&#39;s usually quite hard to fool me.&quot;

Michiru grinned and bowed. &quot;I am the heir to the throne of Neptune, and 
I would not exactly say that I was trying to fool you.&quot;

Staring in shock, it took Makoto a moment or two to find her words 
again. &quot;Well I feel like a fool! Why didn&#39;t you tell me before?&quot; Makoto 
looked surprised and confused at the same time, but not angry as Michiru 
thought she might be.

&quot;You never asked me if I was a princess. Everything I told you was the 
truth, I just left out some minor details.&quot;

&quot;Minor? You call that minor? I fear the day that you rule then.&quot;

Michiru was at the door now, while Makoto was pulling on her boots, 
mumbling. &quot;You should be more thorough in your questioning. Besides, 
it&#39;s not so different from your little escapade last night, so don&#39;t go 
berating me about it.&quot; Michiru replied to the mumbling.

Makoto held up a hand to silence Michiru. She was holding onto her boot 
with the other, part of her foot already in it, while she hopped with 
her booted one, trying to keep her balance. &quot;Hush, just go.&quot;

&quot;Do not be that way now, I was just-.&quot; Michiru started.

&quot;Shoo, shoo, shoo,&quot; Makoto continued rapidly, not looking at her, 
pushing her foot into the boot and proceeding to tuck her pants into 
them.

Michiru laughed. &quot;You are simply adorable Makoto.&quot; She teased one last 
time.

&quot;Begone already!&quot; Makoto snapped. The shirt she&#39;d thrown hit the door as 
it closed behind the amused Neptunian.

Michiru leaned against the door outside the hall, a grin on her face. 
Now she remembered why she was so charmed by Makoto. They were alike in 
many ways, Haruka and Makoto. They both had a charisma about them that 
could catch you off guard at times. You never knew what would come from 
either of them next. Both were also very dangerous, in that they could 
be extremely alluring. Of the two, though, Makoto was the greater threat 
when it came to down to it. She wasn&#39;t aware of her own attractiveness. 
There was an extreme sensuality about her, and it was completely 
unintentional. Michiru had let herself be ensnared once before by this 
disarming quality, but now she knew better. Haruka had that same charm, 
however, she could restrain it, for she knew how to use it to her 
advantage and when to keep it in check. Makoto was completely oblivious.

Michiru continued to grin as she made her way off down the corridor. She 
couldn&#39;t wait to see what havoc Makoto might unknowingly create here on 
the Moon.

-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-

Makoto made her way down to the ship, hoping that they had not started 
anything without her. She felt fine now, not sick like she had last 
night, and her arm wasn&#39;t aching as much. It was more like her head was 
aching from all the complicated thoughts that she was having. The dreams 
bothered her, and everything that Michiru had told her in general 
bothered her. And when she reached the Ship, the fact that everything 
looked like it had been done already bothered her even more.

&quot;Dammit,&quot; she said through clenched teeth. She went onboard to see if 
her observation was correct. It was. &quot;Dammit,&quot; she said again, upon 
exiting the ship. She made her way back to the Palace, wondering where 
she should go next. She wanted to find Boarder or someone she knew. 
Makoto walked through the Palace, passing the occasional servant or 
guard. She came to a stop at an intersection in the hallway she&#39;d been 
walking down. Looking from right to left, and straight ahead, she 
couldn&#39;t decide which direction to take.

&quot;Place is like a damn maze,&quot; she grumbled lowly in the silent corridor. 
Finally, making up her mind, she chose to go right, rather than left or 
ahead. A while later, she didn&#39;t want to admit that she might be lost, 
but it was something she knew in the back of her mind. The halls she 
walked down now were more rustic and old. No tapestries adorned them, 
nor was there carpet down their length. She trudged onward, her 
footsteps echoing against the stone around her, the air cool on her 
skin. She breathed in deep, inhaling a concoction of steel, leather and 
oil, among other familiar smells in the air. She hastened her steps, 
recognizing the scents that assaulted her nose. They made her yearn for 
home, and her body ached for what might await her at the end of this 
hall. Sounds of barked orders and the clanging of steel reached her ears 
as she strode forward, finally coming to the end of the long hall. What 
greeted her brought a smile to her haggard features. It was a large, 
open area outside the white-stone walls of the Palace. A training field. 
Just saying the area was large would not do it justice. It was at least 
five or six times as big as her own field back on Ganymede. She glanced 
around, realizing that she was probably behind the Palace now. Makoto 
was impressed as she even noted that, in the center of the field there 
was a perfectly circular pool that had to be at least around eighty to 
ninety feet in diameter. The same white stones encircled its perimeter. 
Then she noticed that the field was covered in grass, where her&#39;s was 
hard packed dirt. She shook her head, unbelieving, as she realized how 
superior this setting was to her own back home.

Makoto walked forward into one of the stone archways, leaning against a 
pillar there that supported the overhang that wrapped around in a &#39;U&#39; 
shape on the outer walls of the Palace here. There were several doors 
diagonal to her right and left, and looking up, she saw that there were 
many windows and balconies high above the practice field. She found 
herself wondering idly if any of the rooms on her hall were at the back 
of the Palace. She wasn&#39;t even sure where her room was come to think of 
it. She&#39;d been escorted there by a frantic servant the night before and 
hadn&#39;t really been paying attention to directions, and she was surprised 
that she&#39;d been able to find the Great Hall the night before. Still 
thinking, she watched the figures on the field moving in tandem, obeying 
the orders they were being given. It was a fairly small group of men and 
women. All soldiers. Makoto watched more avidly, catching every error, 
every slip each one of them made in their drills. This wasn&#39;t training, 
and she wasn&#39;t impressed with the one giving orders. Her eyes narrowed, 
looking at their conductor, a General she deduced by his uniform. One 
who wasn&#39;t paying much mind to them in the least as he half-heartedly 
called the orders out, casting his gaze around the field and looking 
distracted. The man was tall, but not as tall as Makoto. His blonde hair 
was bound at the nape of his neck, barely long enough to be tied back.. 
He was a beautiful man, who looked as if he had never seen a battle in 
his youthful life. Eyes lazy and face expressionless. He reminded her of 
someone. Someone she hated.

Movement to her left caught Makoto&#39;s attention and she drew her gaze 
from the man she instantly disliked to another. This man strode 
confidently across the yard, coming up behind the smaller man, for he 
towered over the General. His hair was a sandy blonde to the General&#39;s 
gold. From her position, Makoto could not hear the words being exchanged 
so, curiosity getting the best of her, she moved as not to draw 
attention to herself, slowly and silently passing each pillar until she 
was at a respectable enough distance to eavesdrop. No one noticed her as 
she leaned against a new pillar, just under the shadow of the overhang.

&quot;This is the last time I leave things in your hands, Jadeite. This is 
not training.&quot; The tall blonde&#39;s voice was calm and smooth, but his 
disappointment was apparent. Makoto nodded in agreement with his words, 
liking the man already. Then something occurred to her. If he was 
leaving something in the hands of the General, then he himself must be 
of some high rank. She listened intently as the smaller man replied.

&quot;If your hands were not otherwise occupied, maybe you could take it into 
your own, rather than leaving it in mine.&quot;

The tall blonde was not pleased with this statement. &quot;It would do you 
good to mind your own business, and concentrate more on improving your 
half-ass performance. You&#39;re supposed to be instructing them properly, 
but you look as if you could care less. You got this position by blood 
inheritance, not by merit, and I have never forgotten that. I&#39;ve given 
you plenty of damn chances to prove me wrong. Prove that you can do this 
job, but you disappoint me more with each passing day. You are no 
General of mine.&quot; His voice was cutting, causing the smaller man to 
blanch and look away. He opened his mouth several times to say 
something, but seemed to rethink each thing, and in the end, said 
nothing. He glanced back at the soldiers who, during their exchange, had 
come to a halt in their drills. Donning an angry expression, he bowed 
shortly to his superior and stormed from the field, glaring ahead of 
him, not looking back. Makoto flinched at the slamming of the hard wood 
door that the General disappeared through. She was glad to see him go 
and brought her attention back to the tall blonde who was now calling 
out orders to the formerly idle soldiers. They now snapped to attention, 
all bowing in unison to the one before them.

&quot;Good, good,&quot; the blonde smiled at them all. &quot;Now, let&#39;s get back to 
work, shall we.&quot; From that point on, Makoto observed their drills. Every 
mistake she noted, was also caught by the other man. Nothing got past 
his attention, and he even noticed errors that Makoto hadn&#39;t. She found 
her respect for the man growing with each passing minute. His voice was 
firm as he ordered them, his stride easy, and his lithe form radiated 
power as he demonstrated moves with his sword. A scimitar, her mind 
registered. Hold on. Images from the night before flashed through her 
memory. The man who had engaged the Harpy with her had wielded a 
scimitar. The same man who had pulled her roughly from Michiru, and 
might have challenged her had Michiru not stepped in. She looked closer 
at his face, and when he turned, his profile cleared any doubt from her 
mind. It was him. Haruka, Michiru had called him. Makoto&#39;s feelings were 
mixed in that she wasn&#39;t sure if the man was still angry with her, and 
she didn&#39;t know if she would really care if he was or not.

Roughly an hour had passed before they were done with their drills. They 
were instructed to break off into pairs and practice for a few minutes 
while the blonde went back into the Palace to fetch something. They did 
as they were told, and Makoto waited, as they did, for the blonde&#39;s 
return. When Haruka did come back, he was holding a leather ball about 
twice the size of his hand. He tossed it up and down, catching it with 
one hand before him. Making his way over to the men and women he&#39;d left 
moments before, he shouted a new command. &quot;Alright then, are you all 
ready to play?&quot; An affirmative shout came from them all as they cheered 
and smiled at Haruka, chatting among themselves suddenly and forming 
into two groups. Makoto wondered what they were about to do and as 
Haruka looked between the two groups, confusion passed over his face. 
&quot;It seems that we are short one person today, it is an uneven match.&quot;

One of the men replied, &quot;It is always an uneven match when you play!&quot; 
The others laughed as he continued, &quot;you should be counted as five 
people!&quot; Haruka smiled at the comment, but neither agreed nor disagreed 
with him. Makoto leaned her head against the pillar, still wanting to 
know what was going on.

Suddenly, Haruka turned on his heal and faced the spot Makoto was 
standing in. Makoto was surprised when the blonde&#39;s eyes locked with her 
own. A roguish grin spread across his hansom face. &quot;Well, well, are you 
just going to stand there and watch all day?&quot; He asked. &quot;Care to join us 
in our game?&quot; The others, behind Haruka, looked on in confusion, 
probably wondering who he was talking to. When Makoto stepped from 
beneath the overhang and onto the field they looked at each other, 
surprised, then they looked between their leader and the newcomer. 
Makoto felt their eyes on her and it made her a bit nervous, but she 
tried not to show it. Besides, she was more intent on talking with 
Haruka. She walked the distance between them, stopping before the taller 
man. Taller, yes, but not by much. Makoto looked down at the ball that 
Haruka held, and then around at the others, her eyes finally landing 
back on Haruka..

&quot;What do you want me to do?&quot;

-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-

Ami sighed in exasperation as she walked from the ship back to the 
Palace. She had been sure that Makoto might be there, but it had turned 
out that the brunette was nowhere to be found. This afternoon, when Ami 
had awoken, she went to check on Makoto to see how she was doing. The 
Jovian should have been abed, like Ami had instructed her, but no, there 
was no one in the room when she&#39;d arrived. From there she had checked 
the kitchens, deducing that maybe Makoto had gotten hungry, but again, 
there was no Jovian Princess there. Neither was she in her appointed 
room, nor any of the others in the Jovian wing of the Palace. She found 
the woman called Boarder, hoping that she might know of Makoto&#39;s 
whereabouts, but she was just as stumped as Ami. Boarder had given her 
one final suggestion before going to check the towers of the Palace, 
wanting to help Ami. She&#39;d said to check the ship, and then all of the 
training areas, for Makoto usually practiced her swordplay in the 
evenings. And it was approaching evening now, as Ami made her way down 
the corridors to where she knew the Palace&#39;s largest training field was. 
She knew exactly where it was because she walked this path nightly to 
get there. She had training of her own to do each night that kept her in 
shape. She couldn&#39;t read all of the time after all.

As Ami walked on, she began to notice how busy this hall seemed to be. 
It was quite unnatural for the time of day. Usually, only soldiers were 
down here moving about. However, there were more people coming and going 
past her than she&#39;d ever witnessed in this area. Ami hastened her steps 
when the sounds up ahead reached her. It sounded like a crowd of people 
yelling. The words were not discernable to her, but as she neared, she 
could make out that they were cheering. The light grew brighter in her 
progress, her footsteps quick on the hard stone of the floor. Her breath 
was coming fast by the time she finally exited the Palace. Traversing 
the soft ground, her eyes took in the sight before her. There was a 
large group of people, some of them soldiers, others were servants and 
guests of the Palace. They were gathered a little ways away from the 
Palace around something, cheering. She couldn&#39;t see what was going on 
from her position, so she moved forward, pushing through the throng of 
people, who, upon seeing who exactly was trying to break through the 
crowd, moved immediately to let her pass. Sometimes, being a Princess 
had its advantages.

Finally, she was able to see what all the fuss was about. And finally, 
she had found Makoto. Ami&#39;s eyes went wide, and she couldn&#39;t believe 
what she was seeing. Makoto and Haruka were practically killing each 
other! Haruka was in the process of grabbing Makoto from behind and 
pulling her roughly to the side, where the brunette hit the ground and 
rolled away, only to hop to her feet in the next instant. Haruka, in the 
mean time, was making a bee line toward an object lying in the grass but 
a few feet away. She lunged for it, just as Makoto grabbed for her. 
Makoto ended up tripping over Haruka&#39;s legs and falling flat on her 
face. Haruka took advantage of the error, by grabbing the...ball? Yes, 
it was a ball, Ami realized. Oh, no...Ami remembered this game. It was 
one that Haruka had long played with her trainees. It could be very 
dangerous and violent, and Ami could not see why they would wish to do 
such a barbaric thing.

Haruka lifted herself up on her free arm with Makoto now pinning her 
legs down. Makoto was bringing her own leg around to kick the ball from 
Haruka&#39;s other hand, but the blonde threw it in the nick of time, 
sending it soaring across the ground and through a round hoop that was 
suspended at one end of the field. Makoto cursed and Haruka cheered, 
rubbing her arm where Makoto&#39;s boot had come into painful contact with 
it. Another cheer sounded to Ami&#39;s left, and she turned to see Michiru 
waving madly at Haruka and grinning from ear to ear. &quot;How much longer do 
you think you&#39;ll last, Haruka?&quot; She yelled to the blonde. Others around 
them chimed in, supporting her question.

Haruka looked over at her lover, a smirk forming under the dirt that 
covered her sharp features, &quot;Oh, I think you know how long I can last, 
Michiru. You should know quite well.&quot;

Michiru lifted her head high and looked down her nose playfully at 
Haruka, but said nothing in reply. Instead she looked to Makoto, who was 
on her stomach, pushing herself up from the ground. &quot;And you Makoto? Are 
you going to continue?&quot;

Makoto stood, gathering her hair back and retying it. &quot;I&#39;m still 
breathing, aren&#39;t I?&quot;

Ami inspected Makoto critically. The warrior had a cut over one eye, and 
the left side of her jaw bore an angry looking bruise, like she&#39;d been 
hit with something. Ami glanced at Makoto&#39;s arm, trying to determine if 
it might be causing her pain. The brunette didn&#39;t seem to be paying it 
any mind. Ami found herself growing annoyed as the two princesses ran to 
opposite ends of the field. Someone had thrown the ball to Michiru, who 
walked out to the center, placing the ball on the ground with 
exaggerated grace. She sauntered back to the edge of the crowd, looking 
around to make sure everyone was ready. Michiru then lifted her arm high 
in the air, watching the two at either end of the field get into their 
positions. In the next instant those same two were running towards the 
center as Michiru dropped her arm. It was the signal to start, and they 
ran with such speed that it astonished Ami. She didn&#39;t think that anyone 
could come close to being as fast as Haruka, but here was Makoto, almost 
matching her speed. Haruka, of course, reached the ball first though. 
She dipped down fast, grabbing the object and turning to go backward, 
away from the rushing Jovian. She must have had some sort of plan in her 
head, and smiled confidently. That smile dropped away, and the crowd 
cheered with such ferocity that Ami wanted to cover her ears, when 
Makoto barreled into the tall blonde, taking hold of both of her legs as 
she went, and flipping Haruka over her shoulders to land flat on ground 
behind her. Haruka coughed, the wind knocked out of her, and didn&#39;t have 
time to grab at the ball as Makoto swiped it from her quickly, and 
though Haruka was already struggling to get up, Makoto didn&#39;t move, but 
threw the ball from where she was standing. &#39;She&#39;ll never make such a 
throw from that position!&#39; Ami thought, as her she held her breath, 
watching the ball sail through the air at a deadly speed. It went 
straight through the hoop, making no contact with the metal at all. 
Ami&#39;s mouth dropped open and the crowd roared praises at the smiling 
Jovian. Haruka was on her feet and pointing back to the other end of the 
field, for Makoto to get to her end. She seemed to be saying something 
mocking, and Makoto shot her a look that said she could take anything 
the Uranian could dish out. They were comical in a way, and Ami gave a 
half-smile, but in the next instant she shook it off and looked over at 
Michiru, who had just returned from positioning the ball again. Ami 
marched over to her quickly, before she could give the signal.

&quot;Michiru!&quot; Ami snapped lowly, as not to let the others hear her, &quot;how 
can you be condoning this? Makoto is in no shape to participate in such 
an activity! She was close to dying yesterday!&quot;

Michiru just continued to smile her teasing smile and eyed the Jovian on 
the field. &quot;She looks to be in good shape to me, Ami. Anyway, it&#39;s just 
a game.&quot;

Ami clenched her teeth, not answering at first, then looking over at 
Makoto, whom she realized was watching her now. Well, Ami was standing 
right next to their signal, sot that was to be expected. Ami wanted to 
growl, she was so frustrated with these people. Well, if Michiru wasn&#39;t 
stopping this, then she would. Ami turned briskly and set out to walk 
straight out there and stop those two idiots, but she barely made it a 
few feet before she felt and arm encircle her waste and pull her 
backwards. She saw ahead of her that Haruka was running at the ball now, 
but Makoto had yet to move, still watching her. &quot;Move it, Makoto!&quot; Came 
a voice, shouting right by Ami&#39;s ear. This seemed to have some effect on 
Makoto, for she was running to the ball in the next instant.

Ami tried to pry the arm from around her waste, but it tightened all the 
more. &quot;Now, Ami, stop this. Just watch, alright. Let them have their 
fun.&quot; Michiru was resting her chin on Ami&#39;s shoulder, and watching the 
game, while not letting the blue-haired girl go.

&quot;Makoto should not be doing this. She should be in bed, resting. There 
is no way that she is completely healed yet.&quot;

&quot;Makoto is more resilient than you think, Ami. Her body is perfectly 
fine. She&#39;s always been physically strong. There are other wounds, 
though, that you cannot see. Ones that are deeper than any that you saw 
last night. I would think that those are the ones you should be worrying 
about.&quot; Michiru loosened her hold slightly.

&quot;Just because you stayed in her castle for a while, does not make you an 
expert on her.&quot; Ami said, a bit more harshly than she had intended. She 
didn&#39;t know what had even compelled her to say such a thing, but 
Michiru&#39;s familiarity with the Jovian bothered her to no end.

Michiru laughed shortly, still speaking next to Ami&#39;s ear, while they 
both watched the two on the field. &quot;Well then, Ami, I know how much of 
an expert you are in most things, and you&#39;re such a fast learner. I 
heard that you became fluent in Martian in only a month. But, I wonder 
if a month would be enough time to become an expert on Makoto? I very 
much doubt that you could do more than I could in a month, which was how 
long I stayed in her castle.&quot; Michiru&#39;s voice held a challenge in it 
that no one could miss, especially not Ami.

&quot;Are you trying to make a bet with me?&quot; Ami asked in an amused voice. It 
was very well known that the Neptunian princess loved to gamble. She 
took many risks in her life throughout the years. Some even 
life-threatening. Not many things made her back down, and she loved to 
meet any challenge thrown her way. Many were afraid to confront her in 
any way for fear of losing horribly. Michiru was not a woman to be taken 
lightly. For these reasons, the idea of a bet with Michiru highly 
intrigued Ami.

&quot;A bet? Well, you said it, not me.&quot; Michiru was teasing her again. &quot;But 
since you brought it up...&quot;

Ami felt the arms slip from around her waste, and Michiru moved to stand 
beside her, still watching the two play on the field. They were slowing 
down gradually, exhaustion evident in their tired faces. &quot;I&#39;ll be 
leaving in a week you know.&quot;

Ami nodded. &quot;Yes, so I have heard.&quot; Ami had indeed heard that morning 
about Haruka and Michiru returning to their posts in a week. With the 
incident at the party, all of the security in the Moon Kingdom was being 
tightened and reinforced with great efficiency. Also, all of the guests 
were being sent back to their homes, as it was not a good idea to have 
so many people amassed on the Moon, for it could be a true disaster if 
it were to be attacked. Usagi&#39;s celebration was totally ruined by this, 
but the Queen tried to reassure her that it was for the good of the 
Kingdom and that they would find a way to make it up to her. Usagi took 
it very well, and Ami felt proud of her future Queen when she saw 
Usagi&#39;s reaction and her understanding of the situation. Queen Serenity 
did issue one other important order as well. All of her daughter&#39;s 
guardians were to remain on the Moon for the next month as planned, if 
not longer. She&#39;d stated that they would be more powerful if they were 
together, and that the bonds between them should be strengthened. Ami 
didn&#39;t think that Makoto was going to take this very well, seeing as how 
she had talked at the ball of wanting to be back home. Ami was actually 
relieved that she would be staying as planned because she found that she 
liked it here on the Moon. It wasn&#39;t as boring as she&#39;d once thought it 
to be. Funny how that was, and she didn&#39;t know when it had changed.

&quot;Then in a month I will return to report to the Queen in person.&quot; 
Michiru turned and quirked an eyebrow at Ami, one corner of her mouth 
turning upward, &quot;and then I will be expecting to hear a report from 
you.&quot;

&quot;Oh, you will?&quot; Ami played along, &quot;And what exactly am I reporting on?&quot;

&quot;Makoto.&quot; Michiru answered. &quot;I want you to prove to me that you got to 
know her more in a month than I ever could. In other words, tell me 
something I don&#39;t know. That is, if you can.&quot;

&quot;What do you want if I fail?&quot; Ami asked.

Michiru seemed confused, then she looked thoughtful, as if she hadn&#39;t 
even considered this yet. Finally, she answered, &quot;That contraption that 
you carry around. I would like one of those.&quot;

&quot;My computer?&quot; Ami replied.

&quot;Is that what you call it? Yes, then, one of those will do.&quot;

&quot;But you do not even know how to use one, and it takes quite a while to 
learn.&quot;

Michiru smiled, &quot;Mmhmm, and that is the other part of the bargain. You 
are going to teach me to use it.&quot;

Ami wasn&#39;t so sure about that. &quot;You would not be able to share the 
information with anyone else, Michiru. The Moon Kingdom is not ready for 
this technology yet. One day, maybe, but not yet.&quot;

Michiru nodded. &quot;I am quite aware of the laws on Mercury concerning 
things like this. Plus, that&#39;s what makes me want it even more.&quot; She 
grinned wickedly.

Ami shook her head, smiling. &quot;Fine, but what do I get?&quot;

&quot;What do you want?&quot; Michiru asked.

&quot;Um.&quot;

Now Michiru shook her head and, knowing that Ami was too considerate to 
ask for anything too valuable, she spoke. &quot;Tell you what, I will give 
you one of my paintings, or any other work that I have created. You name 
it, and it will be yours.&quot;

Ami stared at her, dumbfounded. Michiru never gave away any of her 
paintings or sculptures. They stayed solely on Neptune. It was very rare 
that she even showed them to anyone but her closest companions and 
friends. To actually own one would be quite a privilege.

&quot;And there is always the satisfaction of beating me,&quot; Michiru smiled 
down at Ami, breaking her gaze from the field.

Ami shook her head, suddenly finding the whole idea ridiculous. Why did 
she let Michiru lead her into things like this? &quot;I can&#39;t accept such a 
bet, Michiru. This is childish, and you&#39;re just trying to distract me 
from getting Makoto off of the field and into bed.&quot; Ami paused after she 
said that and watched Michiru&#39;s face break into a wide grin as the woman 
suppressed her laughter.

&quot;What is so funny? I am right, aren&#39;t I?&quot;

&quot;Wow, Ami, you move fast,&quot; Michiru managed to say.

Ami scrunched her face up in thought, and then slapped Michiru on her 
arm, as realization dawned on her, &quot;Oh, shut up, you know what I meant. 
She needs to stay in bed so that she can rest. I don&#39;t even want to 
imagine what you were thinking.&quot;

&quot;Hm, I bet you don&#39;t.&quot; Michiru&#39;s voice was mocking. &quot;Or maybe you 
can&#39;t.&quot;

Ami was cut off from replying when Michiru laughed as, on the field, 
Haruka threw the ball over Makoto&#39;s head and spun around her, catching 
it on her other side and running away. The blonde managed to throw the 
ball, just before she was tackled to the ground by Makoto. She made the 
goal, and the crowd roared in delight. Michiru turned to look at Ami, 
expectation in her eyes.

&quot;Well?&quot; She asked.

Ami rolled her eyes. &quot;It is too silly. Sorry, but no.&quot;

Michiru bent down slightly, so that she could look Ami straight in the 
eye. &quot;I think that you want to take the bet.&quot;

Ami shook her head again. &quot;No. No bet.&quot;

Michiru nodded, still smiling at Ami. She stood tall again, &quot;You&#39;re so 
cute Ami. I always wanted a little sister.&quot; Someone threw the ball to 
Michiru, who caught it easily. She turned back to Ami. &quot;I&#39;ll be back in 
a month for your report.&quot;

&quot;I told you,&quot; Ami said in exasperation, &quot;I am not making a bet with 
you.&quot;

Michiru ignored her and turned toward the field, but suddenly turned 
back around to Ami. &quot;Oh, and if I might make a suggestion.&quot; She put her 
hand on top of Ami&#39;s head, the smaller girl scowling up at her. &quot;Don&#39;t 
use this too much, okay?&quot;

Ami looked confused, &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Just trust me. You&#39;re too smart for your own good sometimes, Ami.&quot; 
Michiru removed her hand and walked onto the field to set the ball in 
place again.

Ami just looked after her with mild annoyance. The older woman was 
someone that she usually looked up to, but at times Michiru could be 
somewhat eccentric. Sighing in defeat, Ami went to find a place to sit. 
It seemed like it was going to be a long game after all.

-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-

Makoto could feel her own heart beating in her ears as she stood weakly 
in place. She felt that she had just enough strength left to breath now. 
The woman before her looked to be in about the same condition. Haruka, a 
woman. It had surprised Makoto to no end when she found this out. She 
remembered the scene now:

She had grabbed hold of the woman, whom she thought to be a man, from 
behind, bringing her hands around her chest. What she felt there had 
shocked her into freezing on the spot, Haruka&#39;s chuckling became loud in 
her ears. The woman coughed when Makoto made no move to release her, 
&quot;You know, only one person is allowed to touch me there, and though you 
are quite attractive, you really aren&#39;t my type.&quot; Makoto let her go 
then, only to stare at her.

&quot;You&#39;re a woman? But...&quot;

&quot;You assumed that I was a man.&quot; Haruka finished for her. &quot;It&#39;s a 
reaction that I&#39;ve come to expect, and one you seem to have been 
receiving last night.&quot; Haruka grinned. &quot;Though I think that I&#39;m a bit 
better at it than you. Especially since it seems that you&#39;ve opted to go 
without binding yourself today.&quot; Haruka nodded towards Makoto&#39;s chest.

Makoto looked to where Haruka indicated, then back up. &quot;Someone left a 
new change of clothes for me this morning, but there was nothing to bind 
my chest with. I hadn&#39;t considered it a large problem.&quot;

&quot;Certainly large, but not a problem. You might want to consider going 
without the usual binding anyway,&quot; Haruka teased, her voice amused. &quot;I 
know I would if I were you.&quot; She sighed in a wistful manner, and put her 
hand to her own chest. &quot;If only I were so well endowed.&quot;

Makoto had given her a look that clearly said she had no idea what in 
hell Haruka was going on about, having lost the point already.

&quot;Hm, if only,&quot; another voice joined in, and Michiru walked into Makoto&#39;s 
line of sight. &quot;I see no problem with the way you are now, Haruka.&quot;

&quot;You flatter me, Michiru.&quot;

From then on, their game had only gotten more aggressive. They outlasted 
all of the trainees, and ended up playing one-on-one. At some point she 
had noticed that the people watching them were not just made up of the 
soldiers that were originally in the practice yard, but also many 
others. They had drawn quite a crowd. Then there had been more specific 
additions to the crowd that she noted. One example being the small 
Mercurian now sitting primly in a chair next to Michiru. The disapproval 
had shone so clearly on her face, that it had distracted Makoto, causing 
her to miss the signal from Michiru to start. From there on, others 
drifted in, including two blondes, one of which she recognized as Minako 
from the night before. The other looked so similar that they might pass 
for twins. With them came a woman who completely contrasted both with 
her dark hair and brooding expression. She was the one they called Rei, 
the Martian princess, Makoto remembered.

Now, Makoto and Haruka were both standing in the center of the field, 
staring each other down. Michiru, with her taunting smile, stood a 
little ways between them, holding the ball tight to her chest. &quot;Haven&#39;t 
you two had enough?&quot; She asked sweetly.

They looked at her in unison, taking some time to answer. Haruka spoke 
first. &quot;I could do this all night.&quot; She said firmly. Michiru looked at 
Makoto, who nodded in agreement.

Michiru studied Haruka closely, then shook her head. &quot;Haruka, my little 
Uranian princess, I think that if you did play all night, you would 
never see the morning.&quot; She regarded Makoto again. &quot;The same goes for 
you. Though I doubt you would even see the night, seeing as how you are 
injured.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s barely a scratch now!&quot; Makoto replied.

&quot;Regardless, the score is tied and you are both worn out. You&#39;re just 
being clumsy now. So, I&#39;m stopping the game here before you make fools 
of yourselves.&quot;

&quot;What!&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t do that!&quot;

Michiru raised a brow and gave them both a half smile. &quot;Oh, I can&#39;t, can 
I? What are you going to do to stop me? I&#39;ve got the ball.&quot; She held it 
up, trying to bait them.

Haruka lunged at her, making a grab for the ball, only to be evaded 
quickly and pushed roughly to the ground. At that same time, Makoto was 
coming up behind Michiru, hoping to catch her off guard. She failed, 
however, as Michiru ducked and swiftly kicked Makoto&#39;s feet out from 
under her, causing the brunette to fall heavily on her rear, her head 
hitting Haruka in the stomach. Both women groaned, pushing themselves 
away from each other, while Michiru made her way to the edge of the 
field, where the others waited.

They lay there breathing hard and staring at the sky, feeling their 
muscles ache all over. Makoto then spoke in a rough voice, &quot;She has 
quite a kick, doesn&#39;t she.&quot;

Haruka answered with a smile in her words, &quot;You have no idea.&quot;

-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-

Ami watched as Haruka and Makoto helped each other up from the ground. 
The people around them were gradually dispersing, going back to the 
Palace. Ami stood and thought about the proper way to go about 
remonstrating Makoto on her behavior. She would not have been half as 
angry or disappointed with the brunette, had she not gone and pulled a 
stunt like this. Playing such a violent game the day after she nearly 
died of being poisoned.

She was accompanied by Rei, Usagi, and Minako, who stood near her, 
watching the two coming in from the field. They had retreated to stand 
back near the entrance to the Palace, waiting with Ami and Michiru. 
Haruka reached them first, with Makoto trailing wearily behind her. The 
look of disappointment Ami shot Makoto, made her look away quickly.

Michiru went up to Haruka and put her arms around the taller woman&#39;s 
neck, bringing their lips together in a kiss. When she withdrew, she 
looked up at the blonde and smiled. &quot;You did wonderful, Haruka.&quot; She 
received a hug in return.

Makoto watched them with an indifferent expression. &quot;You&#39;re the Princess 
of Uranus then.&quot; It was more of a statement than a question.

Haruka looked over at her and inclined her head. &quot;Pleased to meet you.&quot;

Makoto sighed, her gaze falling on the ground. &quot;I should have guessed 
sooner.&quot;

At this, Minako walked over to Makoto and moved so that she could look 
into Makoto&#39;s eyes. &quot;What are you so gloomy about? You played a great 
game you know. Even if you were injured and you didn&#39;t take Ami&#39;s advice 
about staying in bed, and even if she was so worried about you that she 
spent all day trying to find you.&quot;

Makoto glanced briefly in Ami&#39;s direction and then back down. Minako 
stood straight, contemplating the woman before her. Then, most abruptly, 
she pointed a finger in the air, coming to some conclusion. &quot;Oh, I know. 
You&#39;re upset because you didn&#39;t get one.&quot;

Makoto looked up in confusion. &quot;Huh?&quot; She asked the blonde. &quot;Get one of 
what?&quot;

Minako answered by throwing her arms around Makoto&#39;s neck and pressing 
her lips to the surprised Jovian&#39;s. There was a long pause from the 
group around them, as they watched in a mixture of amusement and shock. 
Then there was a boost in the anger that Ami felt, though she couldn&#39;t 
quite decide whom she was directing it at. Then, there was Rei, pulling 
Minako away from Makoto with one swift motion and putting herself 
directly between the two. She glared down at the blonde she held firmly 
by the shoulders. Makoto stood rigidly behind them, a confused 
expression on her tired features.

&quot;What the hell are you doing! You can&#39;t just do that to someone without 
asking.&quot; Rei chastised Minako.

Minako looked thoughtful. &quot;Then do you want me to ask her?&quot; She made to 
look around Rei at Makoto.

&quot;No!&quot; Rei growled in response, obstructing her view.

&quot;What&#39;s got you so worked up, Rei?&quot; Minako asked innocently, putting her 
arms around Rei&#39;s neck now. The Martian&#39;s eyes got a little wide, and 
her face a little red. Her anger was starting to ebb, being replaced by 
a new emotion. &quot;I know. You wanted one too, didn&#39;t you?&quot; Minako leaned 
forward, towards Rei&#39;s face, coming dangerously close.

Rei leaned backward, away from Minako, panic in her eyes. &quot;No! Not like 
this!&quot; She said suddenly, taking hold of Minako&#39;s shoulders and pushing 
her away. Minako&#39;s expression changed to one of surprise, as if she 
hadn&#39;t expected that response.

&quot;Not like this?&quot; Minako grinned. &quot;Then like what, Rei?&quot; She asked in a 
sly voice, as though she were taunting a trapped animal.

Rei fished around for a reply. &quot;I mean, that is, not here.&quot; Her face was 
very red now. &quot;Not that if we were somewhere else that would make a 
difference,&quot; she rambled, &quot;or that I want one. Cause I don&#39;t!&quot; She said 
with fervor. &quot;I&#39;m not saying that it would be a bad thing, just not with 
me, or her, or anyone. No, that&#39;s not right. What I mean is, you just 
shouldn&#39;t go around randomly attacking people like that. Well, that 
didn&#39;t sound correct either,&quot; Rei mumbled, then babbled on, &quot;Michiru and 
Haruka are lovers, so it&#39;s alright for them, but you and Makoto 
aren&#39;t...you know, and you and I aren&#39;t...you know.&quot; Rei looked almost 
terrified by this point, and Minako finally put a sympathetic finger 
over Rei&#39;s lips, quieting her rambling.

&quot;Yes,&quot; she giggled. &quot;I know. I&#39;m sorry, and I won&#39;t do it again.&quot; Minako 
looked positively delighted now, and Ami couldn&#39;t imagine how she could 
take such pleasure in torturing poor Rei. Why was she so intent on 
embarrassing the Martian?

Rei removed herself completely from Minako&#39;s hold and gathered her wits, 
casting her gaze around the group. She somehow managed to slip back into 
her original persona, the brooding air returning. &quot;It is getting late, 
and the evening meal should be served soon. I supposed that I will see 
all of you there.&quot; She looked over between Haruka and Makoto. &quot;All of 
you that are able, that is.&quot; She then turned smartly and headed straight 
into the Palace, not bothering to look back.

Haruka and Michiru soon followed her, but Minako lingered back with 
Usagi, whispering something to the other blonde causing them both to 
laugh. They continued their secret conversation as Ami approached 
Makoto. She walked straight up to her, arms crossed and chin up. The 
brunette actually took a step back and seemed to steel herself. Ami 
hadn&#39;t expected that reaction really, but it didn&#39;t faze her one bit. 
&quot;Why are you not in bed?&quot; She asked pointedly.

&quot;Because I&#39;m perfectly fine now.&quot; Makoto countered.

&quot;Regardless of how you think your condition is, I am the healer, and I 
said for you to have one day of bed rest. You purposefully ignored my 
instructions.&quot; Ami&#39;s voice was stern.

Makoto paused for a moment. Her tired mind seeming a bit slow in coming 
up with an excuse, then she finally had one, &quot;I didn&#39;t really ignore 
your instructions. You said one day of best rest. Well, I did get one 
day. One Jovian day of rest.&quot;

Ami looked at her in disbelief, doing a few calculations in her head and 
coming up with a conclusion. Yes, days were much shorter where Makoto 
was from, but that was completely beside the point. &#39;We&#39;re not on 
Ganymede.&#39; Makoto looked at Ami with a determined expression. &#39;But she 
really thinks that she has a valid excuse.&#39; Ami shook her head in 
disagreement. &quot;We are on the Moon. It was obvious that I meant a Lunar 
day.&quot;

Makoto drew her lips together in a tight line, then looked over Ami&#39;s 
shoulder, then back to Ami. She did this several times before Ami 
finally turned around to see exactly what was distracting her. Upon 
turning, she caught the tail end of some sort of silent cheer that 
Minako was trying to pull off, waving her fists before her emphatically. 
Ami&#39;s glare made the blonde come to a sudden halt and grin.

&quot;Lovely ribbon,&quot; Ami commented off-handedly, waiting for the woman to 
leave. She&#39;d noticed it earlier, but hadn&#39;t said anything about the red 
ribbon that held Minako&#39;s long blonde hair back today.

&quot;Isn&#39;t it!&quot; She replied with enthusiasm. Then, laughing shortly and 
giving a weak wave, Minako tugged on the arm of the giggling girl beside 
her, pulling the other blonde away with her, toward the Palace.

Ami then turned back to Makoto, only to find the space before her empty. 
She looked around quickly and caught sight of the brunette hastily 
walking toward one of the doors of the Palace. Just as she grabbed hold 
of the handle to the door, Ami raised her voice and asked in an amused 
tone, &quot;Do you have some urgent business in that storage room there?&quot;

Makoto froze and took her hand from the door and looking from left to 
right, probably for another escape route. Finding none, she cursed and 
started walking back to her tormenter. Ami shivered in the cool wind 
that blew Makoto&#39;s unbound hair across her worn features as she returned 
to the Mercurian. Night was settling upon the vast field, and she could 
smell the dampness of evening. Ami loved to be outside around this time, 
when darkness was falling. Later, she would come back to this place to 
get some exercise of her own, then she might go back to her room and 
read a bit. It was usually the same thing each night on the Moon, but 
she was alright with that.

As Makoto stopped in front of her, Ami took a moment to observe the tall 
guardian, noting how slowly she had been walking and the dejected 
expression she wore. Deciding that maybe a scolding was not the best way 
to approach the tired Jovian, she calmed herself and tried a different 
approach. &quot;Lady Makoto, walk with me...please?&quot; She said, looking into 
the other woman&#39;s green eyes. Makoto nodded and walked with Ami, back to 
the Palace. Now, she just needed to figure out a way to break the news 
of Serenity&#39;s announcement to her.

-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-

Makoto looked down at the woman walking beside her. The news that she&#39;d 
just received made her angry and annoyed, and she knew that it wasn&#39;t 
right to take it out on the messenger, but she couldn&#39;t help it. She was 
just so nervous to begin with, and then Ami tells her that she&#39;s stuck 
here for the month, or even longer, when everyone else gets to go home. 
How unfair! Makoto didn&#39;t want to be here at all. She should get to go 
home as well!

The Mercurian beside Makoto reflected her mood as she spoke. &quot;It is not 
as if anything has changed for you, you know. You were to stay here for 
a month from the start.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not the point,&quot; Makoto snapped. &quot;Why is everyone else getting to 
return home, and I have to stay here?&quot;

&quot;Because you are one of Usagi&#39;s guardians, as am I. It is your duty to 
do so,&quot; Ami said through gritted teeth.

&quot;One less guardian will not make a difference. I never asked for this 
duty.&quot;

&quot;Then what exactly are you here for? What is your purpose?&quot; Ami fumed, 
as they both stopped at an intersection in the corridors. &quot;If you 
consider your duty so worthless then I suppose it does not matter 
whether you are here or not. I doubt you would be able to defend anyone 
with an attitude like that.&quot;

&quot;And you could do better?&quot; Makoto asked sarcastically, raising her 
voice, knowing that it was not a fair question.

Ami gave her a withering look. &quot;I do not have to answer such a question 
from one as spoiled and selfish as you.&quot;

Makoto&#39;s blood was boiling. She had never been talked to like this 
before. How dare this little Mercurian say something like that. And why 
the hell was everyone calling her these things today! She clenched her 
jaw, trying to find a retort, but failing. Still she searched her mind, 
hoping to come up with something, for somewhere, a little part of her 
was actually enjoying the confrontation with the smaller woman.

&quot;And I supposed that you like it here, huh?&quot; Makoto asked in a loud 
voice.

The volume of Ami&#39;s voice rose as well. &quot;Yes. In fact, I love it here!&quot;

&quot;Well, then how can you tell me anything? You have no idea how I feel!&quot; 
Makoto growled loudly.

&quot;Sorry if I am not bursting with empathy for you, but it does not matter 
either way. We are stuck here, and you had better get used to it!&quot; Ami&#39;s 
fists were clenched at her sides, her face turning red.

Makoto&#39;s heart was beating fast, her adrenaline pumping. &quot;Why don&#39;t you 
just go to bed or read a book or something!&quot; She yelled.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you just got to he&#150;,&quot; Ami stopped mid-sentence, glaring at 
Makoto. &#39;Come on, say it,&#39; Makoto thought eagerly, &#39;say it already.&#39;

&quot;Take a bath!&quot; She finished in a huff.

Makoto said the first thing that came to her mind. &quot;FINE!&quot; &#39;That was a 
great come back.&#39; She commended herself sarcastically.

&quot;FINE!&quot; Ami yelled viciously back. &quot;Why do you have to be such a damn 
superfluously vexing person of subnormal intelligence!&quot;

&#39;What!&#39; Makoto scrunched her face up in confusion, staring at Ami 
dumbly. &quot;What the hell did you just call me?&quot; She asked in a baffled 
voice.

Ami through her hands in the air, making an exasperated sound, and 
turned on her heal, stomping off down the opposite hall. Makoto stared 
after her, not knowing how exactly to respond to that. Then she was even 
more confused as Ami was suddenly heading straight back to her. The 
Mercurian stopped in front of her, a raging storm in her eyes. &quot;And 
thank you for the roses!&quot; She shouted forcefully, her voice still loud 
and laced with anger. Then, she turned right back around, stomping off 
once again.

Makoto stood for a moment, gaping slightly, wondering if she should wait 
and see if the woman had anything else to add. Finally, she pulled her 
senses back together. &quot;YOU&#39;RE WELCOME!&quot; She yelled back vehemently. Her 
voice reverberated in the dark corridors and her heavy breathing was the 
only sound after it faded away. Makoto took one long deep breath, at 
last breaking her gaze away from the hall down which Ami had 
disappeared. She then turned, heading down a different hall, not really 
knowing where she was going, but that didn&#39;t seem to matter to her at 
the moment. What mattered was sorting out exactly what she had just 
engaged in. Never in her life had she had someone speak to her in such a 
way. She just wasn&#39;t prepared for it. Had she actually felt intimidated 
by Ami? That was ridiculous!

Makoto shook her head. Now she didn&#39;t want to think about it anymore. 
She&#39;d find Ami later, or tomorrow some time and...apologize? She cringed 
at the word. &#39;What do I have to apologize for?&#39; She thought about it, 
then frowned. &#39;I think that I was the one who started yelling first,&#39; 
she thought critically, &#39;and I insulted her first...&#39; Okay, so she 
should apologize. Makoto grimaced at the prospect. Looking around, she 
wondered where she was. &#39;Great. Now I&#39;m lost,&#39; she continued to walk, 
hoping to run into someone soon, whom she could ask for directions. 
&#39;Directions to a bath,&#39; she thought with mirth.</pre>
