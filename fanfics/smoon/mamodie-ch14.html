<a href="../smoon/mamodie-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>---Prologue---

It was the night of the fourteenth annual convention of J-LAD (Japanese 
Lesbians Against Defamation), and the event was a smashing success. 
After the speeches from several prominent figures in the lesbian 
community in Japan, the highlight of the evening was a musical 
performance by the great classical violinist Kaioh Michiru and her 
partner, piano virtuoso and Formula-One racecar driver Tenoh Haruka.

&quot;And now,&quot; the events coordinator, Arisugawa Juri announced, &quot;Ms. Kaioh 
and Mr. Tenoh will...&quot; she was cut off by Haruka putting a hand on her 
shoulder. As Juri looked at the sandy-blonde dressed in a tuxedo 
curiously, Haruka took the microphone away from her to address the 
crowd.

&quot;Ladies,&quot; Haruka began in her normal deep, husky voice, &quot;Michiru and I, 
we... I look out at all of you, and the courage it took all of you to come 
here openly and... Michiru and I, as you all know, are a couple.&quot; Haruka 
started to shake as she took a deep breath. Michiru, dressed elegantly 
in a strapless blue evening gown came over to take her hand, and the 
tomboy continued, &quot;What no one but our closest friends know... Knew, until 
now, is that while I&#39;m often mistaken for a guy... I... I&#39;m a woman, and 
Michiru and I have been in a monogamous lesbian relationship since 
ninety-four.&quot;

The large convention hall suddenly became very quiet. Then, someone 
started clapping, followed by another and another. Soon, the whole group 
of women were applauding the two ladies who&#39;d just come out publicly. 
After Juri came over to give them both hugs of support the two took each 
other in their arms, both feeling like a giant weight had been lifted by 
going public. Once the applause for the two finally died down, they 
began to play their duet before the assembly.

Five minutes into the concert, however, all the lights in the 
amphitheater went out. Suddenly, something that glowed white started to 
float down from the roof. As it came closer to the stage, everyone could 
see that it looked like a woman wearing a classical Greek toga and a 
pair of sandals.

&quot;Fools!&quot; she screamed, &quot;Idiots! You come here with your mullets and your 
combat boots and your flannel shirts and your body piercings, and you 
talk of lesbian love? You&#39;re all a disgrace to feminine love shared 
between two of the same sex! That is why I, the Ghost of Sappho, the 
greatest lesbian who ever lived, have returned to earth to punish you 
all! Leave this building now! Leave, I say!&quot;

In a panic, the group of women ran for the exits to get away. Haruka, 
her hand firmly clutched around Michiru&#39;s wrist, pulled her love behind 
the bleachers.

&quot;Ruka-kun!&quot; Michiru said in fear, &quot;If the ghost of Sappho declares war 
on the lesbians of Japan, what can any of us do to stop her?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, love.&quot; Haruka answered as she pulled out her cell phone, 
&quot;I already know who to go to for help.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; Michiru asked as her partner quickly dialed a number, &quot;Ghost 
Busters?&quot;

&quot;Of course not.&quot; Haruka answered, &quot;I&#39;m calling the Japanese branch of 
Mysteries Inc.&quot;

---Omake Fourteen: Luna Scooba Doo---

&quot;Jinkies gang.&quot; Mamoru said as he parked the Mystery Machine, &quot;This case 
looks like it might be a tough one.&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot; Ami said as she pushed her glasses up the bridge of her nose, 
&quot;You got everything we&#39;ll need once we get in there to hunt down clues?&quot;

&quot;Absolutely.&quot; Rei answered, &quot;Magnifying glass, compass, flashlight, a 
heaping helping of dumb luck, and... Hey, you two in back! You ready to go 
in there yet?&quot;

&quot;Zoinks!&quot; Usagi said, &quot;Like no way Rei! Me and Luna will stay in the van 
while you three hunt down that spooky lesbian in the haunted 
amphitheater.&quot;

&quot;I quite agree!&quot; Luna added, &quot;And before any of you reading this at home 
ask; no, I&#39;m not going to talk &#39;rike ris&#39; throughout this stupid omake. 
A cat has her pride after all, and...&quot;

&quot;Fourth wall!&quot; Ami shouted at Luna, &quot;Anyways, are you sure you wouldn&#39;t 
go in, even for a Luna-Snack?&quot;

&quot;How dare you!&quot; Luna shouted, &quot;I am not one of Pavlov&#39;s dogs, and I find 
it deeply offensive that you think just by waving a &#39;Luna-Snack&#39; in my 
face you can make me...&quot;

&quot;I will!&quot; Usagi shouted.

&quot;What?&quot; Luna asked in shock as Ami tossed her the snack and Usagi 
gobbled it up, &quot;Usagi, that was friggin&#39; cat food! What in the hell&#39;s 
the matter with you, you dumb...&quot;

&quot;Zoinks, like come on Luna!&quot; the blonde said as she grabbed the hapless 
cat&#39;s front legs and jumped out the back of the van, the other members 
of Mysteries Inc. joining her.

------

&quot;Thank goodness you got here so soon!&quot; Juri said as the gang came over 
to the large gathering of women standing outside the building, &quot;The 
Ghost of Sappho has taken over the building, and...&quot;

&quot;Zoinks, then like why call us?&quot; Usagi asked, &quot;Like, Sappho&#39;s Mick 
Foley&#39;s hand puppet, right? Get him to...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s Mr. Socko, not Sappho!&quot; Rei shouted at the blonde, &quot;Sappho was a 
great poet of Classical Greece who wrote love poems to women she was in 
love with. She lived on the isle of Lesbos, and it&#39;s from her and her 
homeland we get the terms &quot;Sapphic&quot; and &quot;lesbian.&quot;

&quot;Jinkies, how do you know so much about lesbian history Rei?&quot; Mamoru 
Asked. Instead of answering, Rei blushed furiously.

&quot;We don&#39;t have time for all this.&quot; Ami said, &quot;We have to capture that 
gal-lovin&#39; ghoul before it&#39;s too late!&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot; Mamoru said, &quot;Come on gang, let&#39;s go catch us a ghost!&quot;

---Three Chase Scenes Later---

&quot;Jinkies.&quot; Mamoru said, &quot;Between the rope and pulley Rei found dangling 
from the roof, and the phosphorescent paint Ami found, I think we&#39;re 
just about ready to enter that part of the show where we set up a trap 
for the ghost.&quot;

&quot;Fourth wall!&quot; Ami said, &quot;I already yelled at Luna earlier for that.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for reminding everyone I&#39;m still here by the way.&quot; Luna 
muttered.

&quot;So what&#39;s your plan?&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;Well; you, me and Ami will work on building a crude catapult over by 
the door. We&#39;ll then set up a net in the middle of the convention 
center. Sappho&#39;s ghost will fall onto the catapult, be launched at the 
net which will catch her, then we&#39;ll see who she really is. All we need 
is a set of volunteers to let the gay ghost chase her and her cat, and...&quot;

&quot;Zoinks! Like no way, Mamo-chan.&quot; Usagi said, &quot;I mean, I love you and 
all, but there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to be the bait in this scheme!&quot;

&quot;Good for you Usagi!&quot; Luna said, &quot;And I&#39;m with her in refusing to 
participate in this ridiculous...&quot;

&quot;Not even for a Luna snack?&quot; Ami asked?

Sure enough, Luna soon found herself being dragged along by Usagi, who 
was licking her lips after eating the Luna snack.

&quot;Zoinks.&quot; Usagi said, &quot;Like, it sure is spooky in the back of this dark 
amphitheater.&quot;

&quot;You should have thought of that before coming back here.&quot;

&quot;Luna, why do you always have to be so mean?&quot; Usagi asked angrily.

&quot;U... U... Usagi-chan,&quot; Luna stuttered out &quot;I... I didn&#39;t say anything.&quot;

&quot;But I did!&quot; an ominous voice said. Usagi and Luna both turned around.

&quot;Zoinks!&quot; Usagi shrieked, &quot;It&#39;s like the ghost of Sappho!&quot;

The blond and her cat immediately ran back to where the others were, 
with Sappho&#39;s ghost hot on their trail.

------

&quot;Okay gang, get ready.&quot; Rei said, &quot;I can hear them coming.&quot;

&quot;Jinkies!&quot; Mamoru said, &quot;Ami, hurry up!&quot;

&quot;Coming Mamo-kun, I...&quot; Ami was cut off as she tripped over a loose floor 
tile, her glasses falling off her head, &quot;My glasses! Where are my 
glasses?&quot;

As Ami searched on all fours in the darkened building, Usagi and Luna 
ran in, followed by the homosexual horror of Sappho&#39;s ghost. In the 
dark, Usagi didn&#39;t see Ami. She tripped over the young genius, flying 
into Mamoru and knocking him into the catapult.

Sadly, while Mamoru was great at coming up with ideas on how to catch 
ghosts, he wasn&#39;t much of an engineer. The catapult had been built to be 
far too powerful, and had been pulled far too taught. Thus, when 
Mamoru&#39;s weight tripped its mechanism, he was not launched the short 
distance over to the capture net. Instead, he was thrust past the net 
into the brick wall at the far end of the event center, hitting it head 
first at close to a hundred and eighty miles an hour.

As his body flopped dead to the ground, the doors to the event center 
were busted open by the Tokyo Police.

&quot;Zoinks!&quot; Usagi cried, &quot;Like, my Mamo-chan&#39;s dead!&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; one of the officers said as he slapped a pair of handcuffs on the 
ghost of Sappho, &quot;And he wouldn&#39;t be if you meddling kids and that 
stupid cat of yours had come to the police in the first place instead of 
trying to solve this case on your own!&quot;

&quot;Never mind that,&quot; Ami said as she came forward and grabbed a hold of 
the Sappho mask, &quot;Let&#39;s see who this ghost really is!&quot; she said as she 
pulled the mask off to reveal...

Usagi&#39;s younger brother, Shingo!

&quot;SHINGO?&quot; the three girls and Luna all screamed in shock out loud.

&quot;Why&#39;d you do it?&quot; Rei asked. The boy turned to the raven-haired beauty 
angrily.

&quot;Why? I&#39;ll tell you why; thirteen chapters straight without me, that&#39;s 
why! Hell, even mom and dad got to make an appearance back in omake six! 
I want the spotlight too, damn it! Just for once...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s enough of that, young man.&quot; The police officer said as he 
dragged the boy off into custody. As Ami watched the police take Shingo 
away, Rei went over to where Usagi and Luna were kneeling by Mamoru&#39;s 
body.

&quot;Zoinks.&quot; Usagi said sadly, &quot;Like, Mamoru&#39;s dead. Now I&#39;m all alone.&quot;

&quot;Not quite.&quot; Rei said as she rested her hand on Usagi&#39;s back, &quot;You see, 
the reason I knew so much about lesbian history earlier was because, 
well, I am a lesbian. And... And I&#39;m in love with you Usagi.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Usagi asked, &quot;Well, like, zoinks, I&#39;m really flattered Rei, 
but I&#39;m straight.&quot;

&quot;You sure you wouldn&#39;t be interested in dating another girl?&quot; Rei asked 
with a devious smile, &quot;Not even for a Luna Snack?&quot;

&quot;Rei, please.&quot; Luna said, &quot;Sure, Usagi&#39;s clumsy, a whiner, not that 
bright, and often thinks more with her stomach than her head, but not 
even Usagi would switch to being gay for a...&quot;

&quot;Make it two Luna Snacks.&quot; Usagi said.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Luna asked in stunned disbelief.

&quot;Done!&quot; Rei said as she handed the two cat treats over. Usagi quickly 
downed the snacks, and then pulled Rei over into a deep sensual kiss. 
Luna turned to the audience.

&quot;Don&#39;t you folks out there sometimes wish it were that easy in real 
life?&quot; the cat asked.

&quot;Fourth wall!&quot; Ami called over from off screen.</pre>
