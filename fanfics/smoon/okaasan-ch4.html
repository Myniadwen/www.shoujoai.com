<h1>Okaa-san? (part 4 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/immeblue.html">Immeblue</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/okaasan-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Later that day at around 9 PM, Makoto walked Ami back to her house. It 
was hard getting Ami to agree to come back, but Makoto made her 
realize she couldn&#39;t hide from the situation.

&quot;Ami-chan,&quot; Ms. Mizuno exclaimed, her whole body filling with relief. 
&quot;Hello Mako-chan&quot; she said acknowledging Makoto&#39;s presence. &quot;I figured 
she was with you,&quot; smiling for the first time since she answered the 
door to see her long lost imuto-chan. &quot;It&#39;s the only reason I didn&#39;t 
worry&quot; seeming to realize what she said Shizuko sobered and gave 
Makoto that &#39;you better not be doing anything your not supposed to 
with my daughter&#39; look and amended her earlier statement &quot;much.&quot;   

All Makoto could do was keep her demeanor and pray she wasn&#39;t 
blushing. The last thing she wanted was to confirm Mizuno-san&#39;s 
suspicions.

Luckily for Makoto, but bad for the situation, Shizuko as well as the 
two young girls were distracted by her imuto-chan. &quot;I still can&#39;t 
believe you condone this behavior&quot; She groaned in disgust.

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; Shizuko asked turning to her younger sister.

&quot;You know what I&#39;m talking about&quot; she said looking from her sister to 
her daughter and her girlfriend. &quot;When I gave my daughter to you I 
knew you could provide the best for her, but I also thought you would 
raise her morally.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous, Yoko&quot; Shizuko bellowed. Not even bothering to 
put her anger in check she continued &quot;I raised her with excellent 
ethics...&quot;

&quot;Ethic&#39;s my foot, I could have died when I saw her with that girl&quot; 
Yoko hollered pointing at Makoto. &quot;If you had raised her with any 
sense of decency she would know that...that...that being like that is 
wrong.&quot;

Makoto had had enough of this and had to put her own two cense in &quot;If 
you had any sense of decency&quot; she began &quot;you wouldn&#39;t be stalking 
people.&quot;

Yoko glanced at her indignantly, then went on as if Makoto hadn&#39;t said 
anything at all &quot;You allowed her to be ruined, she can never marry a 
decent man now.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re being ridiculous again&quot; Shizuko stated plainly, having already 
moved passed her anger. Now she was just annoyed that her younger 
sister could be so naive and blind.

&quot;Ridiculous?&quot; she said looking at the girls standing by the door. 
&quot;What&#39;s ridiculous is that you would allow this. If I hadn&#39;t seen it 
my own eyes I would&#39;ve stayed out of your lives.&quot; Making sure that all 
three females in the room was listening she stated &quot;my aim here is to 
have this relationship expunged.&quot;

Everyone was surprised when the first thing out of Ami&#39;s mouth was 
laughter, cold cynical laughter. Even Makoto was surprised in all 
their years of fighting along side each other she&#39;s never heard Ami 
sound that sardonic.

&quot;Just how do you plan on doing that?&quot; Ami sneered as she continued her 
frosty laughter. It was all Makoto &amp; Shizuko could do to pick their 
jaws up from off the floor, they had never heard or seen this side of 
Ami before.

&quot;I&#39;m gonna take you to live with me...&quot; 

&quot;You can&#39;t do that, so stop fantasizing&quot; Shizuko declared, stopping 
her sisters ranting. &quot;You may have giving birth to her but in the eyes 
of the law she is my daughter.&quot; 

Yoko silently fumed, she understood that her sister was right. &quot;Then 
you put an end to it&quot; she seethed.

&quot;Why would I do that?&quot; Shizuko asked, highly annoyed.

&quot;Their relationship is an abomination...&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re in love for Kami sake&quot; Shizuko shouted &quot;do you really want 
Ami to give up the one she loves, someone who obviously loves her back 
to maybe end up marrying Kami knows who.&quot;

&quot;It could be a very respectable man&quot; Yoko offered weakly, already 
seeing the logic in her sisters argument.

&quot;Or it could be some asshole.&quot; Shizuko swallowed the chagrin she felt 
at using such strong language, &#39;it&#39;s to prove a point&#39; she told 
herself though she still didn&#39;t feel too good about it. &quot;At least 
right now she&#39;s in a relationship where she safe and loved.&quot; Looking 
sternly at her sister &quot;why would you want to break that up?&quot;

&quot;As if she could&quot; Ami and Makoto said in unison. Both ladies turn to 
look at them, though with two different expressions. A comforting grin 
from Shizuko and a far from comforting scowl from Yoko, however the 
disgust that used to be evident her glare wasn&#39;t there anymore. Not 
that either girls cared, as far as Ami was concerned she wanted 
nothing to do with this woman.

&quot;Well,&quot; she started, as she walked to the front door &quot;with your futile 
efforts to break us up thwarted...how about you leave?&quot; 

Again Yoko looked to Shizuko &quot;You raised her with morals, eh?&quot;

Shizuko instantly reddened, embarrassed at Ami&#39;s uncharacteristic 
rudeness. But then she remembered, &quot;treat her as you would want to be 
treated.&quot;

&quot;Hmpf.&quot; Walking to stand in front of Ami Yoko expressed her sorrow &quot;I 
know what happened today has probably made you hate me, but remember 
that I do love you and that I do what I do because I want the best for 
you.&quot; Pausing she studied Makoto for a solemn moment, releasing a 
poignant sigh she said to Ami &quot;maybe someday you&#39;ll come to understand 
that.&quot; The look in Ami&#39;s eyes told her that that day definitely was 
not today. With that she walked out of the door quickly enough to not 
be hit with it.

&quot;I can not believe this day, or the nerve of that woman&quot; Ami exclaimed 
turning away from the door she had just slammed behind her birth 
mother. Regarding the two women still in the house &quot;I&#39;m sorry about my 
earlier temper...&quot; she looked as if she wanted to say more, but all 
she did was walk to the stairs apparently going to her room.

She left the two woman silently staring at each other in the 
livingroom.
