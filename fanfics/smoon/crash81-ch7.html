------

Haruka Ten&#39;ou walked down the street in her street clothes, noting with 
amusement the glances she was getting from other women as she passed 
them by. She could see a pair of young girls only slightly younger than 
she was walking toward her on the sidewalk. Out of habit she winked at 
them. They both covered their faces with their hands and started 
giggling as they passed her by. Once they were gone, she began to 
silently berate herself for flirting like that. She was seeing someone 
now, after all. No, not just someone; she and Michiru had become 
increasingly close over the past week, and she wasn&#39;t about to screw 
that up.

Besides, she was out here on business.

For the last two days, she&#39;d been nagged by something Priss had said 
about the opera singer Reika Chang and the fact that her attacker had 
also been Chinese. Finally reaching the rehearsal hall, she found a 
secluded spot behind a dumpster in a nearby alley and began watching.

------

Michiru Kaiou held her violin case in her hand as she came back from the 
music shop. The new bow she&#39;d purchased sounded beautiful when pulled 
across the strings of her violin, the music store owner practically wept 
as she played a piece by Max Bruch in order to test it out.

She was eager to get home to play for Linna and Priss, especially since 
Linna had revealed to her privately that Priss, who usually hated 
&quot;long-haired&quot; music, had begun to look forward to those times in the 
evening when she would practice her instrument. While she was still 
intimidated a bit by the singer and Knight Saber, she was also happy her 
cousin had found someone who was so obviously in love with her.

As she continued down the sidewalk, she turned to her left and saw 
somebody hunched over behind a dumpster in an alley looking at 
something. She almost ignored it, until the person moved and she got a 
good look at the short blond hair on top of her head.

------

Haruka thought about getting backup when she saw the number of guards by 
the stage door. She was off duty, unarmed, and beginning to feel nervous 
as she continued to watch. She&#39;d seen what had happened to Priss, and 
was now silently debating the wisdom of coming alone.

&quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot; an inquisitive voice asked.

&quot;There appears to be five guards at the back door, but I&#39;m unsure about 
the number that might be inside. I...&quot; With a start, Haruka realized she 
wasn&#39;t alone. Turning around, she saw the beautiful blue eyes of Michiru 
looking at her mischievously. &quot;Michi-chan? What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;I might very well ask you the same question.&quot; the violinist pointed 
out.

Haruka looked nervously from her girlfriend to the rehearsal hall and 
back. &quot;I&#39;m here on official police business.&quot; she explained. &quot;So please, 
try to keep low and keep your voice down.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Michiru asked, &quot;Then where&#39;s your uniform?&quot;

Haruka frowned a bit. &quot;I&#39;m serious Michi-chan. I&#39;m watching that 
building over there where Reika Chang is...&quot;

&quot;Reika Chang? The Reika Chang, the opera singer?&quot;

&quot;I take it you know of her?&quot;

&quot;Who doesn&#39;t. But if she&#39;s inside, why are we out here?&quot;

&quot;Because she may not be all that&#39;s inside there. There&#39;s a chance she or 
members of her entourage may be behind the attack on Priss.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; she asked, a bit taken aback that the world-famous opera 
singer might have anything to do with the attack.

&quot;Yes, really. Believe me, Michi-chan, there&#39;s nothing I&#39;d like better 
than to spend time with you right now, but I can&#39;t. I have a duty to 
perform.&quot;

Michiru silently studied her girlfriend, and the serious expression in 
her face. When it came to her police work, she could be so focused. She 
looked from Haruka to the guards in front of the stage door, and 
suddenly thought of a way she might be able to help.

&quot;Haruka-kun?&quot; she began, &quot;Do you know how to play any instruments?&quot;

Haruka looked at her questioningly, &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;You know, musical instruments. Can you play any musical instruments?&quot;

The police officer shrugged her shoulders, &quot;When I was younger I learned 
how to play the piano. Why?&quot;

&quot;Perfect!&quot; she gushed as she grabbed the taller girl around the wrist. 
Before Haruka could object, Michiru was pulling her out of her hiding 
spot and out into the open.

The guards around the stage door, noticing the violinist and her blond 
companion coming toward them, immediately encircled them. One of the men 
began to ask something in Chinese. Haruka was starting to panic; she was 
unarmed, and wasn&#39;t sure if she could take on all the men at once in a 
fight. Besides which, if a fight did break out, it would be up to her to 
protect her new girlfriend. What in the hell was Michiru thinking?

The violinist, on the other hand, beamed a smile as she remembered that 
Miss Chang had been in France for the last few years.

&quot;Bonjour.&quot; she said, bowing to the guards as she held her violin case 
with one hand and Haruka&#39;s wrist with the other, &quot;Parlez vous 
francaise?&quot;

The guards looked among themselves in confusion. Finally, one stepped 
forward. &quot;Oui.&quot; he said.

&quot;(Ah, wonderful! My name is Michiru, and this is my friend, madem... 
monsieur Ten&#39;ou. We understand there are openings for musicians.)&quot;

&quot;(An opening? You mean in the orchestra?)&quot;

&quot;Oui.&quot; Michiru said with a smile, &quot;(We&#39;re here to audition for 
Mademoiselle Chang&#39;s orchestra.)&quot;

The guard looked her and Haruka up and down, finally turning to the 
guards and speaking with them in Chinese. He then turned back to them.

&quot;(Very well. Wait here while I go in and get the head of security. As 
long as everything checks out, you can go in and audition before 
Mademoiselle Chang herself.)&quot;

&quot;Merci beaucoup.&quot; Michiru answered cheerfully. As the guard left to go 
into the building, she turned to look at Haruka&#39;s startled face.

&quot;Where on earth did you learn French?&quot; the police officer asked.

&quot;Private school. Now smile like I&#39;m giving you good news.&quot; she ordered.

Haruka grinned, noting the Chinese guards were smiling back. 
&quot;Michi-chan,&quot; she said through her teeth, &quot;Why am I supposed to be 
happy?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re going into the auditorium momentarily to audition for the 
orchestra.&quot; The smaller girl answered. Haruka managed to keep her smile, 
but her right eye twitched a bit.

&quot;Michi-chan, do you have any idea how long it&#39;s been since I&#39;ve played a 
piano?&quot; she asked nervously.

&quot;Shh, never mind that. The guard is coming back with someone.&quot; Michiru 
said as the guard and a slightly taller man now returned to them. Bowing 
to the stranger she smiled cheerfully at him. &quot;Bonjour, je m&#39;appelle 
Michiru Kaiou. Je vous presente Monsieur Haruka Ten&#39;ou, ma...&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no need for that Miss Kaiou. I speak Japanese.&quot; the man 
answered. &quot;My name&#39;s Kou.&quot;

&quot;Kou? I&#39;m very happy to meet you, Kou-san, I...&quot;

&quot;May I see your violin case please?&quot; he asked. Michiru looked down a bit 
protectively at the case in her hand, and handed it over. Kou opened it, 
made sure that there was just a violin and bow in it, and passed it 
back. &quot;I apologize, but with the rash of violence lately we can&#39;t be too 
careful.&quot;

&quot;Perfectly understandable.&quot; Michiru agreed. Kou then turned his 
attention to the violinist&#39;s companion. &quot;And where&#39;s your instrument, 
sir?&quot;

Haruka smirked, &quot;I couldn&#39;t find a case big enough for my piano.&quot;

Kou looked at her a few seconds before chuckling at the response. 
Turning to the guards, he explained in Chinese what Haruka had just 
said, and they too broke out laughing. Turning back to Michiru, he 
smiled pleasantly as he asked her to play them something before he took 
her and her companion into the building. Haruka frowned a bit; the man 
was obviously curious to see if her girlfriend was a real musician, or 
someone simply using the violin as a prop to get in.

Michiru took both her mittens off and opened her case. As a gentle 
snowfall began, she placed the mittens between the violin&#39;s chin rest 
and the side of her chin. As Haruka held her case and watched, the 
smaller girl made a few last minute adjustments to the instrument, 
plucking the strings with her index finger and drawing the strings 
tighter with her other hand before she drew the bow across the strings 
and began to play a Mozart piece.

Haruka was spellbound. She&#39;d heard fairly good violinists before, but 
never anything of the caliber she was now hearing. Looking around, she 
saw the guards, and even Kou, were just as mesmerized as she was. One 
guard, a particularly tough looking one with a scar just above his upper 
lip, actually looked like he was tearing up.

Finally finishing the piece, Michiru opened her eyes to find her small 
audience, including Haruka, applauding her. She blushed as she bowed to 
them before putting her instrument back away. Kou walked over to her, 
smiling.

&quot;You don&#39;t belong in an orchestra pit.&quot; he said, &quot;You belong center 
stage as a soloist.&quot; As Michiru blushed even brighter, he then turned to 
Haruka, &quot;If you and the young lady will follow me, I&#39;ll lead you inside 
now.&quot;

------

Daley Wong leaned up against a piece of backstage scenery as he yawned. 
Among the local police officers assigned today to Miss Chang&#39;s security 
detail, he frowned as he thought of how lucky Haruka was to have today 
off. Between the opera singers screeching out their songs and the dull 
western music the orchestra were playing, he was already nursing a 
terrific headache. Worse, because of being rescheduled to today, he was 
missing out on a blind date a friend had set up for him with a kabuki 
actor. True, he was still hurting from the loss of his old lover during 
the riots of a few months ago, but life does go on.

As he turned to look at some of his fellow officers, he saw Reika 
Chang&#39;s right-hand man Kou come in through the back entrance, followed 
by... Haruka and Michiru?

Daley looked at Haruka questioningly, and she gave him a stern look in 
return. Immediately taking it as a sign not to show recognition of his 
partner, Wong discreetly walked over to his fellow officers and spread 
the word not to give Ten&#39;ou away.

Meanwhile, Kou led Michiru and a very nervous Haruka over to a grand 
piano set up on the corner of the stage. Looking out into the stands, 
Michiru saw a single young Chinese woman sitting in the empty theater, 
and bowed to her. Reika Chang nodded back with a smile.

Haruka swallowed hard as she straightened the sheet music in front of 
her. Adjusting her seat, she sat down and studied the piece in front of 
her. Taking a deep breath, she placed her fingers on the keys and 
started to play.

In spite of her nervousness, or perhaps because of it, the music flowed 
out with an emotion and intensity that caught even her off guard. As she 
played, praying that she not hit a bad note, she suddenly heard a sweet 
sounding violin accompanying her. Looking over to her right, she saw 
Michiru playing alongside her. She slowly began to relax as her piano 
and Michiru&#39;s violin complimented each other through the song&#39;s bridge.

At last finishing the piece, Haruka stood up and joined Michiru in 
bowing to Miss Chang, who was clapping for the pair from her seat. She 
then walked from her seat to the stairs at the side of the stage and 
came over to them.

&quot;C&#39;est excellent!&quot; she said. Michiru smiled as she bowed again.

&quot;Merci beaucoup, mademoiselle Chang.&quot; she began, &quot;(I&#39;m glad you liked 
it.)&quot;

Reika returned her smile. &quot;(Your French is very good. You almost sound 
like you have a Belgian accent.)&quot;

&quot;(That would be because my French instructor was from Belgium.)&quot;

Both women laughed at that. Haruka nervously shifted her feet as she 
crossed her arms. She preferred Kou&#39;s company, truth be told. At least 
he spoke Japanese.

As Reika and Michiru continued talking, Haruka noticed something over 
near the side of the stage, partially hidden by the stage curtain. 
Moving back over to the piano, she went through the motions of adjusting 
the seat back to its original position as she quickly looked to see what 
the object was.

She froze when she realized it was a mask of a white tiger.

&quot;Monsieur Ten&#39;ou?&quot;

Haruka turned back to see her girlfriend and Miss Chang both looking 
rather sad.

&quot;Bad news I&#39;m afraid.&quot; Michiru said, &quot;There are no openings left in the 
orchestra. Mademoiselle Chang has promised to remember us though, and to 
recommend us to the owner of the amphitheater.&quot;

Haruka looked from the violinist to Miss Chang and gallantly bowed to 
her. She returned the gesture, complimenting Michiru as she came up on 
having snagged such a handsome young man. Calling Kou over, she had him 
lead both young ladies back out into the streets. Once they were safely 
back out on the crowded sidewalks, Michiru lit up.

&quot;That was incredible!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;We managed to sneak in, meet 
Reika Chang, and play together in front of her. You know, we make a 
pretty good team, I...&quot; she stopped when she noticed the way Haruka was 
silently scowling at her. &quot;Haruka-kun?&quot; she asked nervously. Haruka 
grabbed her by the arm and dragged her into a nearby side street. She 
then began pacing in front of the anxious violinist, trying to get her 
temper under control.

&quot;You could&#39;ve gotten us both killed!&quot; she shouted. &quot;You&#39;re not a police 
officer, and I was unarmed. If anything had happened back there, we 
would&#39;ve both been done for!&quot;

Michiru silently looked down as Haruka continued.

&quot;We had no idea who or what was waiting for us inside the building. Your 
actions placed both of us in danger, and... wait, what are you doing?&quot; 
she asked as she saw a teardrop travel down Michiru&#39;s cheek, followed by 
a second down her other cheek. &quot;No, that&#39;s not fair! I&#39;m right, damn it; 
you&#39;re not allowed to try to make me feel guilty by...&quot; by now Michiru&#39;s 
lower lip was starting to quiver. As the snow fell around them, Haruka 
hung her own head in defeat. She went over and hugged the smaller girl 
to her as she ran her fingers through Michiru&#39;s dark, wavy hair.

&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry, Michi-chan.&quot; she whispered. She couldn&#39;t stand the 
sight of her girlfriend crying. &quot;Please don&#39;t cry. Everything&#39;s all 
right.&quot;

Michiru looked up at her, and Haruka wiped the tears away with her index 
finger. She then cradled the violinist&#39;s face in her hands and kissed 
her gently on the lips.

&quot;Next time, tell me when you&#39;re going to do something that crazy, okay?&quot; 
she said as she stroked her cheeks with her thumbs. Michiru finally 
smiled again.

&quot;Did... Did you learn anything while we were in there?&quot; she asked. The 
blond nodded gravely.

&quot;Hai, I learned something all right. We need to get to your cousin&#39;s at 
once.&quot; she said. With that, both young women headed out of the side 
street toward the house Linna and Priss were sharing.

---To Be Continued---

End Notes: Don&#39;t worry; next chapter, everyone&#39;s back. With a cast this 
large, I just decided it would be fun to give some of the other players 
their own little chapters to play around in. &#39;&#39;Till next time, ciao!</pre>
