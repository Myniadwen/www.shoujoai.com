<h1>The Cruelty and Fairness of Fate (part 22 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a>

<a href="../smoon/cruelfair-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>	Sunlight was just beginning to make itself known as Minako slowly 
woke, blinking her eyes sleepily.  She lifted her head from the edge of 
the bed and winched at the crick that had formed.  She&#146;d fallen asleep 
sitting on the floor, she realized, her hand moving to the ache in her 
neck.
	Minako&#146;s movements roused Artemis from his own sleep.  The white 
cat stirred in his spot on Minako&#146;s lap.  Rising, he slid off her legs, 
then took a moment to stretch, the fur on his back spiking as he did.  
When he felt a hand come down and scratch lightly around his ears, 
Artemis began to purr.  One of his eyes opened enough to look up at his 
mistress, and he returned the small grin she was giving him.
	Minako went about her usual morning ritual, getting showered and 
ready for school.  On the trip between the bathroom and bedroom, she 
saw her parents talking quietly in the kitchen.  The discussion looked 
intent, but it wasn&#146;t an argument.  Apparently, whatever issues they&#146;d 
had with each other last night had been solved, at least enough for 
them to be civil with each other now.
	Knowing she had a little extra time this morning, Minako took her 
time getting dressed.  Truthfully, she wasn&#146;t comfortable with the idea 
of sitting at the table and pretending to have a normal breakfast with 
her parents.  The tense and silent dinner with her mother last night 
had been bad enough.
	A final tug on her hair bow to make sure it was securely in 
place, and Minako nodded to her mirror image.  With Artemis following 
behind her, she went out into the other room to face her parents.
	&#147;Where&#146;s Daddy?&#148; asked Minako when she saw her mother setting out 
breakfast without a place for her father.  &#147;I thought he was driving me 
to school today.&#148;
	&#147;He had some things he had to take care of before work.  Besides, 
things are still too hectic for you to be going out,&#148; answered her 
mother.  &#147;There are reporters all over the place, and I wouldn&#146;t put it 
past them to try and ambush you at school.  We don&#146;t need any more 
attention to this than there already has been.&#148;
	&#147;But,&#148; said Minako, pausing to lick her lips nervously, &#147;we&#146;ve 
got finals in a few weeks.  I really shouldn&#146;t be missing any school.&#148;  
It was an excuse, if nothing else, and maybe if she pleaded grades, her 
mother might change her mind.  Just maybe.
	Or maybe not.
	The elder Aino looked pointedly at her daughter.  &#147;Since when do 
you care about your grades?&#148; she asked.  &#147;A few days isn&#146;t going to 
make any difference, anyway.&#148;
	&#147;But, Mom&#133;&#148;
	&#147;Don&#146;t even bother, Minako,&#148; returned her mother.  &#147;I don&#146;t care 
if you fail the entire trimester and have to repeat the whole year 
because of it, you aren&#146;t going anywhere.&#148;  Her temper starting to show 
through, she went on, &#147;I never wanted you in that school to begin with.  
After we put so much into your education, just to end up having to send 
you to a public high school.  I should have insisted we send you back 
to England after you failed all your entrance exams.&#148;
	&#147;I passed one,&#148; said Minako, an edge of petulance in her voice.
	Her mother shook her head in annoyance.  &#147;And it had to be the 
one for Tenth Street.&#148;  She turned away to retrieve the beginnings of 
her own breakfast, mumbling, &#147;And I still don&#146;t know how you managed to 
get a negative score.  I didn&#146;t even think that was possible.&#148;
	Minako smirked to her mother&#146;s back.  ~Anything&#146;s possible if you 
try hard enough.~

	Wednesday morning, slightly warmer than normal for the time of 
year, and Rei sat on the porch outside her room idly throwing some 
seeds for Phobos and Deimos to eat.  On this side of the shrine she at 
least had some privacy.  The front, on the other hand, was the complete 
opposite.  The usual chores she would do around the yard and grounds 
had to be traded for what she could do inside as a result.  While Rei 
may not have been blessed with the green thumb Makoto was, she did know 
every plant and tree that lived at her shrine.  Not being able to tend 
to them was bothersome to her.
	As she watched her companions eat their breakfast, her thoughts 
drifted to Minako.  They had been able to talk for awhile late last 
night.  Hearing her voice had helped, but until she could actually see 
her and touch her in person, Rei wasn&#146;t going to be able to shake the 
sense of foreboding that had fallen over her.  For all the reassurances 
she had given to try and calm Minako&#146;s fears, Rei couldn&#146;t bring 
herself to believe any truth in the words.
	With a sigh, Rei threw out the last handful of seeds, then stood.  
She and Minako had agreed to talk at midnight.  Just fifteen more hours 
to go.  A small smile tugged at the corner of Rei&#146;s mouth as she 
realized once again how completely addicted she was to this one person.
	As she passed through the main room, Rei heard the phone ring.  
She ignored the insistent tone the way she had every other call in the 
last 48 hours.  On the fourth ring, the answering machine picked up, 
and Rei paused to see if this time someone would leave a message.
	&#147;Rei, it&#146;s Dad,&#148; said the voice after the welcome message.  &#147;Call 
me back when you get a chance.  The number at the hotel is&#133;&#148;
	In her haste to get to the phone, Rei hurdled a flower pot and 
tripped on the edge of the throw rug.  She was barely on her feet when 
her hand grabbed the receiver.  &#147;Dad, I&#146;m here,&#148; she answered, her 
heart beating fast.
	&#147;Rei, sweetheart, how are you doing?&#148; he asked, his voice almost 
pleasant.
	Rei straightened up and leaned against the cabinet that held the 
phone.  &#147;I&#146;m okay, mostly,&#148; she said slowly.  &#147;I&#146;m sorry, Dad, about 
all of this.  I didn&#146;t mean&#133;&#148;
	&#147;It&#146;s okay,&#148; her father answered, cutting her off mid apology.  
&#147;Look, Rei, I don&#146;t have a lot of time right now, but I wanted to touch 
base with you.  I&#146;m betting there&#146;s a lot of people, right now, who 
want to talk you, isn&#146;t there?&#148;
	&#147;Yeah,&#148; said Rei.  &#147;They&#146;re all over the place.&#148;
	&#147;Try to ignore them,&#148; said her father.  &#147;I know it&#146;s hard, but 
they&#146;ll go away soon.  There&#146;s still a few I have to deal with, but I 
don&#146;t want you to talk to any of them.  If you do, it will only give 
invitation to others to harass you even more.  Understand, baby?&#148;
	&#147;Yes,&#148; answered Rei.  &#147;Dad, about Minako.  I was going to 
introduce her to you.  I think you&#146;ll like her, even with all that&#146;s 
happened.&#148;
	&#147;I&#146;m sure I will,&#148; he replied.  &#147;Rei, I have to get going.  I&#146;m 
sorry I can&#146;t talk more right now, but there&#146;s business I have to take 
care of.  We&#146;ll talk more about everything when I come to visit.&#148;
	&#147;You&#146;re still coming?&#148;
	Her father laughed.  &#147;Of course I am.  I promised, didn&#146;t I?&#148;
	&#147;Yes, but&#133;  Never mind,&#148; said Rei, shaking her head as if to 
clear it.
	&#147;All right, then.  I&#146;ll see you next weekend.  Tell your 
grandfather &#145;hello&#146; for me.  Maybe he&#146;ll be lucky and get some free 
publicity for the shrine out of all this,&#148; he said with a chuckle.  
&#147;Bye, sweetheart.&#148;
	&#147;Bye, Dad,&#148; answered Rei.  When she heard the other end click, 
she put the phone back in its cradle.  He was coming, and she should be 
glad of that.  She should be even happier that he wasn&#146;t upset with 
her.  Yet, that sense of uneasiness that had been nagging at her only 
seemed to grow.


*            *            *

	Minako&#146;s Wednesday was a basic replay of the day before it.  She 
got up and ready for school in an attempt to get out, only to be told 
she would be staying home again.  Talking to Rei late at night helped, 
but she was going to go stir crazy soon if her parents didn&#146;t at least 
let her out for some air, stalker press or not.
	After breakfast, Minako changed her clothes, then set to washing 
the dishes.  After that, she willingly exiled herself to her room.  By 
lunchtime, she had gone through all of her manga and magazines, and her 
schoolwork was actually starting to look like a good alternative to 
being bored.  Putting that thought quickly out of her mind, she 
contemplated doing a bit of spring cleaning to help pass the time.  
Thusly, when her father came home at six o&#146;clock, Minako was sitting in 
the middle of a pile of clothes, shoes, and plain old stuff that she 
had gutted from her closet and drawers.
	&#147;I was cleaning,&#148; she answered with a sheepish grin when her 
father asked what was going on.
	He didn&#146;t seem to be amused.  &#147;Come out here.  Your mother and I 
want to talk to you.&#148;
	Minako extricated herself from her mess and went out into the 
livingroom.  Her parents were seated together on the couch.  She sat in 
the chair next to them as she was told, her eyes glancing the thick 
folder that sat on the table in front of them.
	Her father took several moments to gather his thoughts, and 
Minako knew he was gearing up for a big decision speech.  That in 
itself made her nervous.
	&#147;Your mother and I have discussed this at length,&#148; he began.  &#147;We 
feel we&#146;ve come to what will be the best solution for everyone.  
Understand, Minako, that we realize this situation hasn&#146;t been any 
easier on you than it has on us, and that what we&#146;re asking from you 
isn&#146;t an easy thing, even if it is ultimately for the best.  So, to 
make it easier, I&#146;ve decided the best thing would be to simply remove 
you from the situation as completely as possible.&#148;
	Minako&#146;s eyes widened in shock as any hope she&#146;d held out was 
abruptly shattered.  She knew what was coming next.
	&#147;I want you to finish high school.  It&#146;s the only way you&#146;ll be 
able to make anything of yourself,&#148; continued her father.  He reached 
forward and opened the folder that sat on the table.  &#147;I&#146;ve looked into 
several schools, and your mother and I think these are the best among 
those closest to home.  You&#146;ll be far enough away from all this 
unpleasantness, not to mention other distractions, that you&#146;ll be able 
to concentrate on your studies without being so far away that you feel 
completely displaced.&#148;
	Several brochures were laid out in front of Minako.  She stared 
at them without really seeing, only able to concentrate on the hole she 
felt forming in her chest.
	&#147;You get a choice,&#148; said her father, either not noticing or 
ignoring the state his daughter was in.  &#147;The timing of this is 
unfortunate.  You won&#146;t be able to complete the term, but hopefully, if 
you do well enough on the placement exams, whichever school you choose 
will be willing to overlook an incomplete term.  If not, you&#146;ll just 
have to repeat the year.&#148;  He gathered the brochures back up and 
returned them to the folder.  He then handed it to Minako.  &#147;Take this 
back to your room and look it over.  We&#146;ll discuss this again in a few 
days, after you&#146;ve had some time to think about it.&#148;
	Minako nodded.  She held the folder to her chest and rose to head 
back to her room.
	&#147;Oh, and Minako,&#148; said her father after she&#146;d taken several 
steps.  When she turned back to look at him, he went on, &#147;I know 
placement tests aren&#146;t your strong suit, but each of those schools has 
one, and I expect you to pass whichever one you take.  No back-up 
school this time.  Remember, there are always other options open to us 
should you choose not to do your best.  Options I think you&#146;d like even 
less than you do this.&#148;
	Minako&#146;s mouth formed into a tight frown as she looked at her 
father.  With a quiet, &#147;Yes, sir,&#148; she went back to her room.  As soon 
as the door was closed behind her, the folder hit the already cluttered 
floor, and Minako hit the bed, landing on her stomach.  She buried her 
face in her pillow, held on to it as tight as she could with both 
hands, and screamed at the top of her lungs.
	Artemis, startled and confused by Minako&#146;s actions, jumped up 
carefully on the bed beside her.  &#147;Mina?  What happened?&#148;
	As her muffled scream petered out, Minako&#146;s grip and posture 
loosened.  She flipped over onto her back and stared up at the ceiling.  
Blowing an errant lock of hair out of her eyes, she answered, &#147;Boarding 
school.  They&#146;re sending me to boarding school.&#148;


*            *            *

	Minako lay on her bed in the dark, faint bluish light finding its 
way into the room from the night traffic outside.  Artemis was lying at 
her feet, quietly curled up and pretending to sleep.  One more hour 
until midnight, when she was going to have to tell Rei.
	The frown she&#146;d worn all evening was still on her face.  It, 
along with the anger underlying it, were foreign things to her.  Yes, 
she had frowned before, just as she&#146;d felt anger.  But it had never 
been quite this strong or lengthy, and it had never been directed at 
people she loved.
	She reached for the chain around her neck and found the ring it 
held.  Gliding the ring back and forth along the chain, Minako thought 
about her parents.  She did love them, even if she had a hard time 
getting along with her mother.  When you honestly loved someone, that 
love didn&#146;t just go away, no matter how angry you might get at them.  
But they weren&#146;t being fair about this.
	 Minako&#146;s hand paused and fully gripped the ring.  Slowly, she 
sat up, which caused Artemis to raise his head from his paws.  The cat 
watched as Minako reached behind her and undid the chain.  She slid the 
ring off the necklace, set the chain on her nightstand, then replaced 
the ring on her finger.  For several minutes, she sat and stared at her 
hand and the ring that glinted in the nighttime dimness.  Then she 
abruptly got up and turned on the light.
	Artemis squinted against the sudden burst of artificial light 
that engulfed the room.  When he could see again, Minako was quickly 
rooting through a pile on the floor.  She emerged triumphant with a 
duffle bag and proceeded to immediately begin filling it with clothes.
	&#147;Mina, what are you doing?&#148; asked Artemis, sure he wasn&#146;t going 
to like the answer.
	&#147;I&#146;m packing,&#148; answered Minako as she continued to fill her bag.  
&#147;I suggest you do the same thing, if there&#146;s anything you want to bring 
with you.  I don&#146;t know if we&#146;ll be coming back.&#148;
	&#147;Where do you think we&#146;re going?&#148;
	&#147;To Rei&#146;s.  Don&#146;t ask silly questions.&#148;
	Artemis sighed.  He understood her wanting to do this, but had to 
at least try and talk some logic into her impulsiveness.  &#147;Running away 
isn&#146;t going to solve things, Mina,&#148; he said gently.
	Minako paused in her frantic packing.  &#147;I know, Artemis,&#148; she 
said quietly.  &#147;But it can&#146;t make things much worse.  Don&#146;t you 
understand?  This isn&#146;t my home anymore.  Rei is.  And Fate can&#146;t wash 
your back if you don&#146;t give It any soap.&#148;
	&#147;Mina?&#148;
	&#147;Setsuna told me once that nothing happens by accident,&#148; 
explained Minako.  &#147;Fate set up everything so we would become Senshi 
when we were supposed to.  And Fate gave me Rei.  I have no doubt that 
on my 20th birthday, I&#146;ll be able to stand beside her, regardless of 
what happens between then and now.  That&#146;s Fate.  What happens in the 
three years between then and now, though, that&#146;s up to me.  If I&#146;m 
supposed to be somewhere else, then that&#146;s what will happen.  But I 
refuse to just sit by and let everything happen to me without at least 
trying to fight for what&#146;s mine.  I&#146;m going home, Artemis.&#148;
	&#147;Okay,&#148; said Artemis, resigning himself to Minako&#146;s will.  If she 
wanted to fight, then he would stand beside her, win or lose.  &#147;Let me 
help you pack, then, so you don&#146;t forget anything.&#148;  He began to move 
towards the nightstand to retrieve Minako&#146;s chain, but she stopped him.
	&#147;Leave it,&#148; she said, a shadow of her old smile coming back to 
her lips.  &#147;I don&#146;t need it anymore.&#148;


*            *            *

	When she didn&#146;t come out for breakfast, he&#146;d just assumed she had 
finally settled down a bit and was taking advantage of her forced 
vacation.  When he had finished the last of his coffee and still hadn&#146;t 
heard anything from either her or her cat, he began to worry.  He&#146;d 
seen the look Minako had worn as she&#146;d gone off to her room last night.  
Perhaps she was taking all of this harder than he&#146;d anticipated.  He 
supposed, though, he couldn&#146;t blame her for not wanting to speak to her 
parents this morning.  Still, there was something not right about how 
quiet she was being.  He suspected her mother noticed it also, from the 
looks she kept shooting in the general direction of Minako&#146;s closed 
bedroom door.
	It was her mother who broke first.  She got up from the table and 
set her dishes in the sink before walking calmly to Minako&#146;s door.  She 
paused for a moment, seemingly unsure and a bit nervous.  The 
indecision was short lived, however, and Minako&#146;s mother knocked 
lightly on the door.  This surprised her husband, because she&#146;d 
declared emphatically that Minako&#146;s privacy had disappeared along with 
their family&#146;s the day they&#146;d been thrust into the headlines.  For her 
to change her mind now showed just how reluctant she was to see what 
was behind that door.
	When she got no answer, Minako&#146;s mother raised her hand once more 
and knocked more loudly.  Again, there was no answer.  Rather than 
knock again, her hand instead reached for the door knob and turned it.
	His wife&#146;s curse was loud and uncharacteristic.  It was also a 
relief in its own strange way.  Before he could dwell on that for too 
long, he was up and in the bedroom doorway, staring at the same thing 
his wife was:  an extremely messy room and no Minako.


*            *            *

	Rei shifted a bit, sitting up straighter and moving one arm out 
from under Minako&#146;s weight just enough to restore the circulation.  She 
resettled against the headboard of the motel bed and closed her eyes.  
She was tired, but sleep eluded her.  It was a combination of nerves, 
adrenaline, and not knowing what might come crawling out from the 
corners of the room that kept her up.  But this place was the type used 
to getting strange visitors at all hours of the night, and they would 
take your money, no questions asked.  After Minako showed up on her 
doorstep, luggage and Artemis in tow, this was the best Rei could do to 
keep them from getting into any more trouble, at least for the time 
being.
	The stirring of the girl curled up against her side caused Rei to 
open her eyes.  She looked down into Minako&#146;s blue eyes and gave her a 
tentative smile.
	Minako returned the gesture, her arms tightening around Rei for 
several seconds.  &#147;Did you manage to get any sleep?&#148; she asked quietly.
	&#147;A little,&#148; lied Rei.
	Minako nodded slightly, then said, &#147;I hope Artemis got to Usagi&#146;s 
okay.&#148;
	&#147;I&#146;m sure he did,&#148; answered Rei.  &#147;We&#146;ll call him later to make 
sure.  After we figure out where we&#146;re going to go.  I&#146;d like to at 
least be someplace I can take a shower without any kind of yuck factor 
involved.&#148;
	Minako giggled, the beginnings of a genuine smile on her lips.  
&#147;This place isn&#146;t as bad as you keep saying.  Your standards are just 
too high.  But maybe we could go to Mako-chan&#146;s for awhile.  Ami did 
tell us where they hide the emergency key.&#148;
	After several moments of thought, Rei answered, &#147;For a few hours, 
maybe, if we&#146;re sure no one&#146;s following us.  I don&#146;t want to stay 
there, though.  This is too much stress to put on them.  It would be 
better if we just find a hotel to stay at.  Hopefully one where no one 
will recognize us.  I have enough money for a couple days, and then&#133;&#148;
	Minako waited as Rei&#146;s voice trailed off.  When nothing more was 
forthcoming, she prompted with a gentle, &#147;And then?&#148;
	Letting out a frustrated sigh, Rei snapped, &#147;I don&#146;t know!  Why 
am I supposed to be the one with all the answers?&#148;  Her eyes closed and 
let her head fall back against the headboard.  &#147;I don&#146;t know.&#148;
	Surprised, and suddenly feeling a bit guilty, Minako slowly 
reached up and placed her fingers against Rei&#146;s cheek.  She stroked 
gently until Rei&#146;s tension started to ease.  When Rei finally opened 
her eyes, Minako said, &#147;It&#146;s okay, Rei.  I don&#146;t think you have to have 
all the answers.  We&#146;ll figure things out together.  We&#146;ll go talk to 
the others, see what they think, and everything will get worked.  We&#146;ll 
be okay.&#148;
	Rei grinned weakly at the hope and reassurance she heard in 
Minako&#146;s voice.  She reached out and took a lock of Minako&#146;s hair in 
her hand, threading the strands around her fingers.
	&#147;Should we call Grandpa?&#148; asked Minako.
	&#147;No,&#148; answered Rei.  &#147;Not yet.  I&#146;d rather he didn&#146;t have to lie 
for us if anyone comes looking for you.  And I left him a note, so he 
knows I&#146;m okay.&#148;
	Minako moved away from Rei a bit and sat up completely before 
taking Rei&#146;s hand and tugging her into a new position.  Rei relented 
reluctantly, staying on top of the blanket, but resting her head on 
Minako&#146;s lap the way the blonde wanted her to.
	&#147;That&#146;s it, Rei,&#148; said Minako, her voice as soothing as the 
fingers that ran through Rei&#146;s dark tresses.  &#147;Lie down and get some 
rest.  I&#146;ll watch out for the creepy crawlies for awhile.&#148;
	Rei ignored the little giggle from Minako that was aimed at her 
dislike of this particular establishment.  Instead, she pulled Minako 
closer for warmth and allowed her eyes to close as she tried once again 
to summon sleep.


*            *            *

	For the last few days, there had been a dark cloud of ill feeling 
hanging over the shrine.  Grandpa had hoped it would all blow over 
quickly.  That didn&#146;t seem to be happening, though, not with Rei&#146;s 
father taking every opportunity he could to further feed the public on 
what should have been a family matter.  And now he had to deal with one 
more thing darkening his doorstep.
	Grandpa reminded himself that he was playing the role of 
respectable family elder in this case, but only for Rei&#146;s sake.  As 
such, he tried not to judge the man in front of him solely on 
appearances.  The uncomfortable stiffness in his posture, as well as 
the displeased expression on his face, could very likely just be the 
results of having to deal with an unsatisfied press and the invasion of 
his own privacy.  Grandpa also suspected it had more than a little to 
do with the vague note Rei had left behind this morning in place of 
herself.
	&#147;Good morning, Aino-san,&#148; said Grandpa pleasantly, hoping his 
tone would help set the direction of this encounter.  &#147;It&#146;s good to 
finally meet you, though I had hoped our fist meeting would be under 
better circumstances.&#148;
	&#147;Forgive my rudeness, sir, but I&#146;m not here for a social call,&#148; 
answered Minako&#146;s father.  &#147;It&#146;s been a very trying morning, and the 
only reason I&#146;m here is because I want to know where my daughter is.  
And I want her returned to me immediately.&#148;
	So that was what Rei had meant by &#145;with a friend.&#146;  The polite 
smile Grandpa wore began to fade.  Calmly, he replied, &#147;She isn&#146;t here.  
I&#146;m afraid I don&#146;t know where she is.&#148;
	After a deep breath that seemed to be as much about calming his 
temper as frustration, Aino-san said, &#147;I&#146;m sure your granddaughter has 
some idea where Minako might be.  If you would be good enough to ask 
her, I would appreciate it.&#148;
	&#147;Rei isn&#146;t here at the moment.&#148;
	Minako&#146;s father raised an eyebrow at that.  Then he shook his 
head.  &#147;Of course she isn&#146;t.  I shouldn&#146;t be surprised about that.&#148;  
His hand reached into his pocket and began to fiddle with his keys.  
&#147;I&#146;d prefer not to have to bring the authorities into this, but I will 
if I have to.  She has until tomorrow night to come home with no 
further consequences.  If you speak to your granddaughter, please ask 
her to relay that for me.&#148;
	Grandpa nodded.  Then he said, &#147;If I may?  It&#146;s been my 
experience that if a child feels threatened, they only run further 
away.  But if you give them some understanding, even with disapproval, 
they come home on their own.&#148;
	Through narrowed eyes and an even deeper frown, Minako&#146;s father 
replied, &#147;I&#146;m assuming you knew about this&#133; relationship.&#148;
	&#147;I did.&#148;
	&#147;And you just simply condoned it?&#148;
	&#147;At first, I had some concerns,&#148; answered Grandpa as he folded 
his arms casually across his chest.  &#147;But I realized I had truly little 
reason for that concern.  Rei isn&#146;t a child.  She understands what 
she&#146;s doing.  And Minako is a fine young woman who any family would be 
proud to count among their own.&#148;
	&#147;Look, whatever you want to teach your child, and however you 
want to raise her, is no concern of mine,&#148; said Minako&#146;s father, the 
color in his face rising with his blood pressure.  &#147;Just don&#146;t try and 
include my daughter in any of it.  The responsibility for her lies 
solely with my wife and me.  So if she comes back here, I expect you to 
send her home.  Now, if you&#146;ll excuse me, I have other things to take 
care of this morning.&#148;
	Grandpa didn&#146;t bother saying anything further as the man in front 
of him turned and walked away.  He stood for several moments, alone and 
in silence, before leaving the room.  There was only so much that could 
be chalked up to youth and desperation.  He hoped dearly that Rei and 
her friend hadn&#146;t crossed that line.


*            *            *

	Very glad to be getting out of this place, Rei turned in the key 
to the room she and Minako had been using.  The motel was near lifeless 
at this time of day, the usual patrons all having gone back to their 
day to day lives.  Rei didn&#146;t have day to day life to go back to just 
yet, but she did have friends with a spare key.  She and Minako could 
stay at Makoto&#146;s until Ami and Makoto came home, and then just take it 
from there.
	They were almost to the exit when a voice said from behind a 
newspaper, &#147;If you&#146;re going to shack up with your girlfriend in a love 
motel for the night, you could at least pick someplace a little more 
upscale than this.&#148;
	Rei froze in place, the nerves she&#146;d finally managed to tie up 
instantly fraying.
	The newspaper lowered to reveal the smug smile of Kojima Ishata.  
&#147;And while you&#146;re at it,&#148; he went on, &#147;you should make sure no one&#146;s 
tailing you.  How goes it, kid?  Gonna introduce me to your 
sweetheart?&#148;
	Rei glared daggers at the man as Minako tugged on her arm.  &#147;Rei, 
do you know this guy?&#148;
	Kojima stepped forward before Rei could say anything and bowed 
with great flare before Minako.  &#147;Kojima Ishata, journalist for The 
Tokyo Daily.  It is my pleasure to finally meet you.&#148;
	Minako took a reflexive step back.  &#147;Um&#133; nice to meet you?&#148; she 
started to say hesitantly before Rei stepped completely in front of 
her.
	&#147;Listen here, you rat,&#148; said Rei loudly.  &#147;I told you the other 
day to leave us alone.  You&#146;ve got no idea why we&#146;re here, and you&#146;ve 
got no right to know, either.  So just go back to the sewer you crawled 
out of!&#148;
	&#147;That&#146;s rather harsh,&#148; replied Kojima, a hurt expression on his 
face.  Then he grinned.  &#147;But you do have a valid point.  What the two 
of you were doing up there, no one really needs to know about.  
Besides,&#148; he said with a shrug, &#147;this isn&#146;t the kind of story The Daily 
would run.&#148;
	Rei stared at the man, dumbfounded.  Which was nothing compared 
to Minako&#146;s confusion as she watched these two, who obviously knew each 
other&#133;
	&#147;Wait a minute,&#148; said Minako suddenly, the proverbial light bulb 
coming on.  &#147;Kojima from The Daily?  You&#146;re the one who wrote that 
first article about us.&#148;
	Kojima nodded, obviously quite pleased to have Minako recognize 
him.
	&#147;It doesn&#146;t matter who he is,&#148; jumped in Rei.  &#147;And why are you 
here if you can&#146;t use this as part of another article?&#148;
	With a smirk, Kojima answered, &#147;Because I want a statement from 
you.  I&#146;m tired of listening to your old man.  He&#146;ll say anything to 
anyone who asks.  But you&#133;  We&#146;re lucky if we get so much as a &#145;no 
comment&#146; or &#145;go to hell.&#146;  So, when the guy I had outside your house 
last night called and said he was trailing you downtown, I thought I&#146;d 
take a chance.&#148;
	&#147;You shouldn&#146;t have wasted your time,&#148; said Rei.  Then she 
grabbed Minako&#146;s wrist and started pulling her towards the exit.
	&#147;I wouldn&#146;t go that way if I were you,&#148; called Kojima.
	Rei would have ignored him if Minako hadn&#146;t forced her to stop.  
&#147;Why not?&#148; asked the blonde.
	&#147;My cameraman&#146;s still out there, parked at just the right angle 
to get a lovely shot of you framed nicely in the doorway of Motel 
Paradise.&#148;
	&#147;I thought you said you couldn&#146;t run this kind of story.&#148;
	&#147;The Daily won&#146;t,&#148; answered Kojima.  &#147;But there are others who 
will.  I&#146;m always up to a little pseudonym labeled freelancing.&#148;
	Rei&#146;s shoulders slumped and she sighed.  &#147;Don&#146;t they make you 
sign contracts against that sort of thing?&#148;
	Once again, Kojima shrugged.  &#147;Eh.&#148;  Then he smiled at them.  
&#147;Tell you what, we&#146;ll make a trade.  You go out the alley, and I&#146;ll 
pretend I never saw you here.  In return, you promise to talk to me 
before going to anyone else, should you feel like making any kind of 
official comments.  How about it?  Deal?&#148;
	Rei scrutinized the man before her.  She had no real reason to 
believe he had anyone out there at all, or if he did, that the person 
wasn&#146;t waiting in the alley to ambush them.  Still, at this point, she 
didn&#146;t have anything but her pride left to lose.  So, abruptly and 
without saying a word, Rei jerked Minako in the opposite direction and 
headed for the alleyway.
	Kojima couldn&#146;t stop grinning as the girls hurried passed him.  
And he couldn&#146;t help a chuckle as he heard Minako ask Rei to slow down 
and question just how it was she knew &#145;that guy&#146; anyway.  The last 
thing he heard before sitting back down and picking up the sports 
section was an agitated, &#147;I&#146;ll tell you later.&#148;


*            *            *

	Rei sat on the breakfast counter in Makoto&#146;s kitchen, the phone 
to her ear and her bare feet tapping anxiously against the cabinets 
beneath her.  Minako was out in the other room with Luna and Artemis, 
while Rei had retreated in here to call her grandfather.
	&#147;Grandpa, it&#146;s me,&#148; she said when he answered.
	Rei heard him exhale heavily before saying, &#147;Finally.  Where are 
you, Rei?  Are you and your friend all right?&#148;
	&#147;We&#146;re doing okay,&#148; she answered.  Then she hesitated for a 
moment, debating with herself before continuing, &#147;It would be better if 
you don&#146;t know where we are, though.  I think you know I&#146;m with Minako, 
and her dad is looking for her.  We barely missed him once this 
morning, and I&#146;m sure he&#146;ll come by there.  I don&#146;t want to put you in 
the middle of this anymore.&#148;
	&#147;He&#146;s already been here,&#148; replied Grandpa.  &#147;This was probably 
the first place he came.  Now, tell me where you are.&#148;
	Rei stopped biting her lip to answer, &#147;Ami and Makoto&#146;s.&#148;
	&#147;Don&#146;t sound so worried about telling me.  I won&#146;t tell anyone 
where she is.  But Minako&#146;s father wants her home.  He said she won&#146;t 
be punished if she comes home by tomorrow night.&#148;
	&#147;They&#146;re already punishing her!&#148; shot back Rei.  &#147;They&#146;re sending 
her away to boarding school.  All because she got involved with me.  I 
won&#146;t let that happen.&#148;
	&#147;You won&#146;t have an easy time changing her father&#146;s mind.  He 
doesn&#146;t seem to me like the type to back down from his decisions.  You 
can&#146;t run forever, Rei.&#148;
	&#147;Yes, we can, if we have to.&#148;
	Grandpa sighed in exasperation, and Rei could picture him with 
his hand to his forehead to ward off the headache this was likely 
causing him.  &#147;You have to make your own decisions about this.  Just 
remember that you also have to live with the consequences of those 
decisions.  Think before you do anything else.&#148;
	&#147;I know, Grandpa.  I will, I promise.&#148;
	&#147;You can bring her back here if you want to.  But if her parents 
come back for her, I won&#146;t be able to stop them from taking her home.&#148;
	&#147;I understand,&#148; answered Rei.  &#147;We&#146;re making other plans, so 
don&#146;t worry about it.  We aren&#146;t staying here much longer, either.&#148;
	&#147;Whatever you do,&#148; said Grandpa, &#147;you&#146;re going to have to come 
home tomorrow morning.  The monsignor called.  We have an appointment 
at the school tomorrow at nine.  Unless you took your uniform with you, 
you&#146;ll need to come back here to get ready.&#148;
	Rei groaned quietly and ran a hand through her hair.  &#147;I&#146;d 
forgotten about that.  Okay, Grandpa, I&#146;ll be home tomorrow.&#148;
	&#147;I&#146;ll see you then.  And be careful, Rei,&#148; said Grandpa before 
saying goodbye.
	Rei hung up the phone and slid off the counter.  Now that she was 
done talking herself, she could hear the voices in the other room.  
They must have gotten home while she was on the phone.  Usagi&#146;s voice 
stood out over the others, and Rei grinned.
	In the livingroom, Ami and Makoto stood by Minako as Usagi threw 
her arms around her neck and held on as if she hadn&#146;t seen Minako for a 
year.  For a moment, Rei smiled warmly at the sight.  Then the smile 
turned to a smirk.  &#147;You know, Odango, there are some women who 
wouldn&#146;t take kindly to you hanging onto their girlfriends like that.&#148;
	&#147;Rei!&#148; called Usagi happily.  She tried to take a step towards 
Rei without letting go of Minako.  When she realized she couldn&#146;t, she 
whimpered slightly, her eyes darting between her friends as she tried 
to decide what to do.
	Rei made it easy on her princess and moved over to the group.  As 
soon as she was close enough, Usagi latched onto her with one arm and 
pulled her even closer.
	&#147;Yeah, I missed you, too, Usagi,&#148; said Rei quietly as she 
returned the hug.  After a few moments, she wriggled away from Usagi&#146;s 
stranglehold.  &#147;Okay, okay, that&#146;s enough.  You&#146;re wrinkling my shirt,&#148; 
she complained, using her hands and making a show of smoothing out her 
t-shirt.
	The girls settled down in the livingroom, with Ami, Usagi, Rei, 
and Minako squeezing together on the couch.  As Makoto slouched down in 
her chair and propped her feet up on the coffee table to get 
comfortable, Rei  began to explain in better detail what her hosts had 
already been told by Usagi.
	&#147;We came here from the hotel,&#148; went on Rei, already reassured 
more than once that it was okay they were here.  &#147;If we&#146;d been 15 
minutes later, we would have run right into Minako&#146;s father.&#148;
	&#147;At least I know he&#146;s looking for me,&#148; said Minako.
	&#147;He&#146;s been by the shrine, too,&#148; added Rei.  &#147;I bet he&#146;s hitting 
each one of our homes trying to find out where we&#146;ve gone.&#148;
	&#147;I guess that explains the note that was on the door,&#148; threw in 
Makoto.
	&#147;What note?&#148;
	&#147;The one that&#146;s in my trashcan,&#148; answered Makoto around a grin.  
&#147;Does he really think I&#146;d call him to rat you guys out?&#148;
	Minako shrugged.  &#147;I guess he&#146;s hoping you&#146;re all more 
&#145;reasonable&#146; than I am.&#148;  She caught Artemis as he jumped up onto her 
lap and held him loosely as she went on.  &#147;I never told him about you 
and Ami, only that you were moving into a new apartment.  My parents 
still think Ami lives with her mom.&#148;
	Luna joined the girls and Artemis up on the couch by moving onto 
Ami&#146;s lap.  She was greeted by a light scratching around her ears, to 
which she responded with a low, involuntary purr.  Then, remembering 
herself, she settled more seriously and faced Minako.  &#147;Are you certain 
you don&#146;t want to go back home?  It may be possible that this whole 
boarding school idea is just a knee-jerk reaction to everything that&#146;s 
happened.  You may still be able to reason with your parents.&#148;
	Minako shook her head.  &#147;No, Luna, my parents thought this out.  
They want me away from all of this.  And away from Rei.  Now, with my 
running away like this, there won&#146;t be any other sort of reasoning.  My 
mom wasn&#146;t just talking, either, the other day when she said she wished 
they&#146;d sent me back to England.  If I go back there now, she&#146;ll have me 
enrolled and on a plane before I can say Big Ben.&#148;
	Luna nodded, and for a moment, silence fell over the group.  In 
her chair, Makoto fidgeted a bit, drawing Ami&#146;s attention.  When she 
sat up straighter and leaned forward slightly, her eyes holding Ami&#146;s 
the whole time, she got everyone else&#146;s attention as well.  Finally, 
she said to Ami, &#147;It can&#146;t hurt just to mention it.  Let her decide 
what she wants to do.&#148;
	A tiny frown formed on Ami&#146;s lips, clearly indicating she didn&#146;t 
like the idea, but she nodded slowly once in agreement.
	&#147;Okay,&#148; said Makoto.  She took a moment to gather her thoughts 
and figure out how to approach this.  &#147;Um, well, me and Ami sort of 
started discussing this a few nights ago after everything happened.  
Well, not this, exactly.  More like that it was a shame you didn&#146;t have 
more control over what was happening to you, and how I kind of 
sympathized because I remember how frustrated I felt when I had to go 
through Yoshiro-san for the final word on everything.  I was making all 
the decisions, but, ultimately, he had control over everything, and 
that annoyed me to death.&#148;
	&#147;Who&#146;s Yoshiro-san?&#148; asked Usagi.
	&#147;Oh.  He&#146;s my guardian.  He was, anyway.&#148;
	More than a little confusion passed among the girls.  &#147;You have a 
guardian?  Since when?&#148; asked Rei.
	&#147;*Had* a guardian,&#148; corrected Makoto.  &#147;And since my parents 
died.  You guys don&#146;t really think anyone would let an eight-year-old 
live by herself, do you?&#148;
	&#147;Correct me if I&#146;m wrong, but isn&#146;t that exactly what you were 
doing?&#148;
	One corner of Makoto&#146;s mouth turned up into a lopsided grin.  
&#147;Yeah, more or less.  Yoshiro-san was never a family man.  He only took 
me on out of respect for my father, since they were good friends and 
business partners.  He also thought I was too financially independent 
to be reliant on the state for my upbringing.  Which basically means he 
didn&#146;t trust them, so he decided to do it his way instead.  I went 
through three nannies in one month before he finally agreed to let me 
try it on my own.  He kept an eye on me, mostly through his assistants, 
and he made sure I knew how to handle my money before he turned control 
of my bank account over to me.  Actually, Ami&#146;s got a term for it all.&#148;
	&#147;Salutary neglect,&#148; said Ami when Makoto waved it off to her.
	Usagi&#146;s eyes narrowed as she turned the words over in her head.  
&#147;Salu-what-what?&#148;
	Ami smiled at the blonde.  &#147;It means, on paper, Makoto belonged 
to him, but he wasn&#146;t really taking care of her the way a parent 
should.  He didn&#146;t harm her, and he made sure she had all the 
necessities she needed to live, but he never really cared for her, 
either.  The relationship was purely a legal one.&#148;
	&#147;Which was exactly the way I wanted it,&#148; interjected Makoto.  &#147;If 
he&#146;d really tried to be a father to me, he wouldn&#146;t have made out any 
better than those nannies he hired.  And he&#146;s a good man, regardless of 
how it all sounds.  His handling of my larger accounts is the only 
reason I can live like I do, and he doesn&#146;t get anything in return for 
what he does for me.&#148;
	Minako bit the corner of her lip and nodded.  &#147;Mako-chan, I&#146;m not 
really seeing what any of this has to do with me.  I mean, it&#146;s kind of 
neat finding out you have a guardian and all&#133;&#148;
	&#147;That&#146;s the thing,&#148; interrupted Makoto.  &#147;And it&#146;s what I keep 
saying.  He&#146;s not my guardian anymore.  When I turned 14, Yoshiro-san 
decided since I was already living as an adult and had proven I could 
handled it, there was no reason I shouldn&#146;t be completely recognized as 
one.  So, he helped me petition the court to make me an emancipated 
minor.&#148;
	&#147;It means she&#146;s legally an adult,&#148; said Ami when two pairs of 
blue eyes turned to her.  &#147;But Makoto&#146;s situation was different than 
Minako&#146;s,&#148; she said by way of caution.  &#147;Her guardian endorsed the 
idea.  I don&#146;t think Minako&#146;s parents will simply agree to it, and they 
do have the right to challenge it.  Aside from that, if you were 
successful, it absolves your parents of any responsibility towards you.  
They&#146;ll still be your parents, but they won&#146;t have to support you 
anymore, nor will they have to house you, and since you&#146;ve already 
graduated 9th grade, they aren&#146;t compelled to educate you any further.  
You would become completely independent and responsible for yourself.&#148;
	&#147;Actually, if you can&#146;t prove you have a place to live and a way 
to support yourself, the court won&#146;t even consider the request,&#148; said 
Makoto a bit ruefully.
	&#147;That isn&#146;t a problem,&#148; replied Rei.  &#147;She lives at the shrine 
with me.  Grandpa can give her a job if she has to have one.&#148;
	&#147;Mina?&#148; said Artemis quietly when the girl sat silent as everyone 
talked around her.
	All eyes were on her now, and Minako felt the pressure from the 
need to make a decision.
	&#147;Minako,&#148; said Ami gently, &#147;you don&#146;t have to decide right away.  
It was just an idea we had that we thought might help.  Keep in mind, 
though, that if you do decide to try this, you won&#146;t be able to take it 
back, no matter what the outcome might be.&#148;
	&#147;Thanks, Ami,&#148; answered Minako, reaching across two laps to take 
her friend&#146;s hand and give it a squeeze.  &#147;But I suppose, if I&#146;m being 
honest, that the decision has already been made.  I knew when I left, I 
wouldn&#146;t likely be going back there, and we can&#146;t hide out for much 
longer.  So, if I try Mako-chan&#146;s idea, and it doesn&#146;t work, my parents 
ship me off to boarding school overseas.  If I don&#146;t try Mako-chan&#146;s 
idea, eventually I&#146;m going to have to go back, and my parents will 
still ship me off to boarding school overseas.  From my point of view, 
I&#146;ve got nothing to lose, and we haven&#146;t come up with any better 
ideas.&#148;
	&#147;If you want, I can call Yoshiro-san in the morning,&#148; offered 
Makoto.  &#147;Find out how to get all this started.&#148;
	Minako nodded.  &#147;Thanks, Mako-chan.  I&#146;d appreciate it.&#148;
	&#147;No problem,&#148; answered Makoto.  She stood and stretched her arms 
out in front of her.  &#147;I say we all eat, cause I&#146;m starving.  And none 
of that hotel nonsense.  You guys stay here tonight.&#148;  She turned and 
started to head towards the kitchen, not waiting for either Rei or 
Minako to protest.  &#147;Come on, Usagi, you and Ami can help me.  I&#146;ve got 
a foolproof dessert recipe for you to try out.&#148;
	Ami stood as well, keeping Luna with her.  &#147;There are some 
leftovers in the refrigerator for you and Artemis,&#148; she said to the 
cat.  &#147;I&#146;ll get them for you if you come out here with us.&#148;
	Taking the hint, Artemis jumped down and followed them into the 
kitchen.
	Once alone, Rei and Minako filled in the spot Usagi had vacated 
and moved closer together.  Rei put her arm around Minako&#146;s shoulders 
and held her, Minako&#146;s head resting on Rei&#146;s chest.  Minako closed her 
eyes and listened to the sound of Rei&#146;s heart, the steady beat slowing 
down her world and calming her.  &#145;Just like this, forever,&#146; she 
thought.  &#145;This is how it&#146;s supposed to be.&#146;


*            *            *

	Sitting on the bedroom floor, a few books scattered around her 
and her notes from the day illuminated by her booklight, Ami 
highlighted the particular section of the lesson she was having issues 
with.  She read over the paragraphs more slowly, taking apart the 
individual sentences to find their meaning.  Even as she did this, she 
still wasn&#146;t coming up with the same conclusions her teacher had 
reached.  Perhaps she would bring it up in class tomorrow.  Hideo-
sensei always did seem to enjoy a challenge to her own way of thinking.
	The bed shifted behind her, and Ami looked up from her notes, 
pushing her glasses back up from where they had slid down her nose as 
she did.
	Makoto sat on the edge of the bed, blinking sleepily.  She yawned 
once, then squinted down at Ami.  &#147;There you are,&#148; she said, her voice 
sleepy-rough.  She stood slowly and pointed towards the doorway.  &#147;Be 
right back.&#148;
	Ami turned back to her books and reanalyzing the passage until a 
toe disturbed her by nudging against her thigh.
	&#147;It&#146;s almost one,&#148; said Makoto.  &#147;Come to bed.&#148;
	&#147;In a few minutes,&#148; answered Ami without looking up.  &#147;Just let 
me finish this.&#148;
	Makoto stayed where she was, standing over Ami, and crossed her 
arms over her chest.  &#147;You&#146;re mad at me, aren&#146;t you?&#148;
	Ami slowly closed her book and removed her glasses before looking 
fully up at Makoto.  &#147;No, not really,&#148; she answered quietly.
	&#147;Don&#146;t lie,&#148; teased Makoto, a grin tugging at the corners of her 
mouth.  &#147;If you were really obsessing over your schoolwork the way it 
looks like you are, you&#146;d be out at your desk because you don&#146;t care if 
anyone sees you studying.  But you&#146;re in here hiding because you don&#146;t 
want Rei or Minako to wake up and see you, which means you&#146;re upset 
with me about bringing up that whole thing with Minako, and you&#146;re 
using schoolwork as an excuse for not coming to bed.&#148;  Makoto nodded, 
pleased with her breakdown of the situation.  &#147;Yep, that&#146;s how it is.&#148;
	Ami offered back a small smile for Makoto&#146;s mental efforts and 
rose from the floor.  She went over to sit on the bed, tucking her feet 
under her as she did.  &#147;I&#146;m more concerned than I am angry,&#148; she said.  
&#147;I really do wish you hadn&#146;t brought that up, Mako-chan.&#148;
	&#147;Why?&#148; asked Makoto as she sat on the bed beside Ami.  &#147;It was 
just an idea, and you heard Minako.  She doesn&#146;t really have anything 
to lose if this doesn&#146;t work.&#148;
	Ami&#146;s lips formed a thin line, and her eyes cast down.
	&#147;Come on, Ami,&#148; said Makoto, her finger reaching for Ami&#146;s chin 
to tilt it back up.  When they were eye to eye again, Makoto lifted a 
finger and tapped it against Ami&#146;s forehead.  &#147;Tell me what&#146;s going on 
up here.&#148;
	&#147;She can&#146;t win, Mako-chan,&#148; answered Ami solemnly.  &#147;From a 
purely legal perspective, if her parents choose to fight this, they&#146;ll 
win, because they haven&#146;t done anything wrong, and no judge will take 
away their right to raise their daughter just because they won&#146;t let 
her date whoever she wants to.  And I&#146;m afraid of what will happen 
afterwards.  This could very well destroy whatever relationship Minako 
has left with her parents, because there is going to be a lot more 
anger and hurt feelings, not to mention hurt pride, caused by this.&#148;
	&#147;Ami, sweetie, Minako&#146;s relationship with her parents went out 
the window when all of this started.&#148;
	Ami shook her head.  &#147;If that were true, they wouldn&#146;t care one 
way or the other where she is right now or what she&#146;s doing.&#148;
	&#147;Okay,&#148; sighed Makoto.  &#147;If that&#146;s what you&#146;ve really been 
thinking, why didn&#146;t you say any of that earlier?&#148;
	&#147;Because when you first brought it up, I had no idea Minako was 
going to run away.  I certainly never believed this would become a 
viable option for her.&#148;  Ami took a breath, then reached over to finger 
the sleeve of Makoto&#146;s nightshirt.  &#147;And because I don&#146;t have a better 
solution for her.  I can tell her to be cautious, but how can I 
completely take away the only real chance she thinks she has to be with 
Rei when I can&#146;t give her something to replace it?&#148;
	Taking the hand that was tracing along a seam over her shoulder, 
Makoto twined her fingers around Ami&#146;s.  &#147;Have a little faith, Ami.  
And who knows?  Maybe this time Fate will wind up smiling on all of us 
at once.&#148;</pre>
