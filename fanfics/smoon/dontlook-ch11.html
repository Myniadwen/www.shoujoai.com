Turning, she stared in horror at the door where the dark-haired Sarah 
stood, gun clutched in white knuckled hands&#133;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Silent tension crackled through the air as everyone stared at the 
desperate looking girl at the door. Haruka held her throbbing arm as 
she stood stiffly by the corpse of her friend.

&#147;I didn&#146;t want to do this Haruka! YOU MADE ME! How could you leave me 
for that little bitch?&#148; the girl asked, onyx eyes spitting fire as she 
focused only on the blonde, who was holding her arm as a slight bit of 
blood spilled between her fingers, &#147;If I can&#146;t have you&#133;then nobody 
will&#133;&#148;

From where they were on the floor, Michiru looked back at Chelle, who 
was fumbling for something in her purse. Dark blue eyes widened as the 
other girl pulled a tiny handgun from her handbag, trembling fingers 
causing the clip to shake as she checked to see if it was loaded.

&#147;What are you doing?&#148; Michiru hissed, watching with wide eyes as the 
other girl took careful aim.

&#147;Doing what should have been done when the little bitch was born&#133;&#148; the 
desperate girl grated before one more shot rang out, throwing the 
half-sane Sarah through the glass in front of the coffeehouse. A few 
screams and yelps were followed by mass cheering from the other 
customers as they realized the danger was over. As Haruka stepped 
forward to check Chelle&#146;s date&#146;s pulse, Michiru leaned forward, 
hugging the other girl as she started sobbing. Sirens of police cars 
could already be heard.

Something still tugged at the back of Michiru&#146;s mind as she racked her 
brains for what she was thinking of before the last few minutes had 
happened. Something glinting in the sun&#133;two people&#133;Derek!

&#147;Haruka! Derek is still back at the beach! He gave Sarah the gun! I 
saw it when I looked back! He&#146;s after Lil! And Mike!&#148; Michiru yelled, 
causing Chelle&#146;s eyes to widen. She nodded, standing away from her 
friend to look at her employer.

&#147;Y-you gotta s-stop him. H-he wants to company. I-I saw a few memo&#146;s 
to lawyers a-and other documents. I didn&#146;t think o-of them though. 
I-I&#146;m sorry&#148; the secretary stuttered, still in a state of shock. The 
bartender took hold of Chelle&#146;s shoulders, giving Michiru a reassuring 
look.

&#147;I&#146;ll take care of her and answer the cops. We&#146;ll send some after you, 
okay?&#148; the boy asked, receiving a nod from Michiru as she led the 
furious Haruka out of the shop. It didn&#146;t take much to get Haruka 
going as the blonde sped back toward the beach, soon followed by a 
couple of cop cars, letting Haruka speed up with the lead cars 
go-ahead. Teal eyes glittered with fury; anger building by the moment 
as a theory started to form in her mind&#133;

~ * ~

&#147;Please&#133;leave her alone&#133;&#148; a weak voice pleaded, the British accent 
thickened with desperation as Lil watched Derek pick the half 
conscience Mike up before laying her on the bed, taking his time in 
undoing the tomboy&#146;s shirt.

&#147;Shut up Lilica. You always did whine too much. Dropping me, I could 
have handled, but to leave me for this&#133;half woman. Christ, you 
disappoint me. I thought you had what it took to be a brilliant minded 
woman. Instead, you go off and start banging a woman. Disgusting&#148; 
Derek sneered darkly, removing the blonde girl&#146;s pants with slow 
deliberation. He cursed as he suddenly felt a small fist connect with 
his jaw as the fiery girl shot at him again, only to be thrown back 
against the wall. Several bruises were already forming on the girl&#146;s 
face as she looked up at Derek with cold steel-grey eyes. It&#146;d been a 
shock to be pulled out of Mike&#146;s arms roughly, thrown into the hard 
surface of the counters before being forced to watch her lover be 
beaten unconscience.

&#147;Slimy little bastard. Get away from her!&#148; Lil screamed, go at him 
again with her hand, managing to claw him across the face, leaving 
four bloody trails, before being thrown back. Tears welled in her eyes 
as Mike turned her head slightly, groaning in pain. Fury followed 
swiftly as Lil threw herself at him again, following the same pattern 
before as she landed hard against the wall. She started sobbing as 
Derek removed his trousers, taking his time lowering himself onto her 
lover&#146;s prone body. With one more vengeful try, Lil picked herself up, 
throwing herself as hard as possible into the man&#146;s body, throwing him 
into the wall ahead of her. He let out a loud bellow, picking Lil up 
by the hair. Grinning sadistically, he raised his hand, stopping with 
a stunned look as the door of the trailer flew open to reveal a 
furious looking Michiru and an even more fury filled Haruka.

&#147;Let. Go. Of. Her.&#148; The blonde grated before flying at him, landing a 
few expert punches in his solar plexus and jaw. Lil stumbled forward, 
plucking Mike from the bed in a burst of strength before tripping, 
landing at a safer distance from Derek with Haruka&#146;s cousin wrapped 
protectively in her arms, not letting even Michiru touch her lover in 
her shocked state. Michiru settled for wrapping a blanket around the 
two before facing the others.

Haruka stood over Derek with a look of pure rage in her eyes; &#147;you 
were going to rape her? Like you raped Lilica? Like you almost raped 
Michiru? What kind of sick bastard are you?&#148;

Derek laughed darkly, wiping a trail of blood from his lip; &#147;you 
figured it out huh? Here I thought my sister would have gotten rid of 
you soon enough. Guess she failed. Yes, I was going to rape her. Then 
I&#146;d kill her and then Lilica. Is that what you wanted to hear?&#148; he 
sneered, slowly reaching behind him while Haruka was distracted a 
moment by Michiru&#146;s small cry of remembrance. Pulling a heavy cal. Gun 
from his waistband, Derek lashed out, taking one shot before making a 
run for the door. He smashed through it, only to land into a barricade 
of cops, all guns trained on him as a scream was heard from Haruka 
inside the trailer. Rather then aiming for Haruka, He&#146;d aimed for 
Michiru&#133;and he hadn&#146;t missed&#133;
