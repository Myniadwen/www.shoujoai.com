<h1>Altered Destinies (part 22 of 22)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/altdest-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>Author&#39;s Notes: Found this on my hard drive recently. This is my first 
version of the &#39;Tuxedo Mask possesses someone to save Sailor Moon&#39; 
story, from when I was a big fan of the English dub. My first impulse 
was just to erase it, but instead I&#39;m putting this up for the 
amusement value, as well as an example on how a fairly lame story can 
still have a few good ideas in it. I hope you find some enjoyment in 
it.

It&#39;s set at the end of the Doom Tree storyline...



Sailor Moon: Altered Destinies Version 0.1

&quot;I am dying, Sailor Moon&quot; the Moonlight Knight gasped, his body 
begining to dissolve into white light, &quot;and Darien is too far away to 
join us together. I must find another...&quot; In a moment, he had 
dissolved into sparkling light and was gone.

In the hallway, Molly ran towards the disturbance, having seen her 
friend Serena go into the building. As she neared the door she was 
engulfed in the shining light.&quot; You,&quot; she heard in her mind, a warm, 
kind voice &quot;you too care for her. Take my power and protect her ,for 
all our tomorrows...&quot; and then she fell to the ground unconscious.



Breaking up with Melvin had been hard, but with everything that had 
been going on lately, she didn&#39;t see much choice. The blackouts had 
been bad enough, but the dreams she was having had really took the 
cake. In her dreams she was male! And romancing Serena! Not too 
mention the dreams of a vaguely European world where she danced with 
Serena&#39;s look alike. In comparison, it was as if all she had felt for 
Melvin had been a pale shadow.

As Molly walked by the video store, she saw the TV report on Sailor 
Moon&#39;s new ally, the tuxedo dressed heroine, and felt a strange 
recognition...

Suddenly, Molly felt like she was going to have a blackout again, but 
this time she fought the sensation! She struggled on until the 
feelings changed, and a crystalline clarity washed over her. She knew, 
now, what had happened: she was now Sailor Moon&#39;s protector as Tuxedo 
Mask, the reborn prince, and had also inherited the feelings and 
affections of her past self.

Molly ducked into a deserted alley and willed the change, feeling her 
clothes shift and flow into a form fitting tuxedo, cape and mask, then 
she leapt across the rooftops. From then, it was like she was in a 
dream, casting the roses at her foes, using her speed and strength to 
buy Sailor Moon time to strike their enemy down.

&quot;Who are you?&quot; Sailor Moon asked, grabbing Tuxedo Mask by the arm. 
Molly was surprised Sailor Moon didn&#39;t recognize her, and even more 
surprised to realize she knew who Sailor Moon and friends were.

&quot;This isn&#39;t the best place to discuss it, Sailor Moon.&quot; Tuxedo Mask 
answered her calmly. &quot;Follow me, and I&#39;ll tell you.&quot; Pulling free, she 
led them a merry chase across the city rooftops, finally stopping in 
the small forest behind Raye&#39;s temple.

&quot;Why did you pick here to talk?&quot; Sailor Moon asked, looking very 
nervous. Molly smiled mysteriously as her cape flowing around her in 
the breeze, letting them sweat for a moment, then relented. Closing 
her eyes, she allowed the transformation to was over her again. 
&quot;Molly?!&quot; Sailor Moon cried out, shocked.

Molly laughed softly, answering &quot;It&#39;s good to see you too, Serena. Hi 
Lita, Mina, Amy and Raye. Before you all panic, there&#39;s a good reason 
that I know who you all are.&quot; Then, Molly quietly explained what had 
happened to her. After mulling it over, the Scouts returned to normal 
and headed into the temple to talk.

Mina looked speculatively at Molly and asked, &quot;You have Tuxedo Masks 
powers and memories right?&quot; Molly nodded in answer, and Mina 
continued, &quot;Did you get anything else from him?&quot; with a slightly evil 
smile. Molly blushed brightly and Mina realized she had hit pay dirt.



The other scouts noticed as well and were all paying very close 
attention, except for Amy, who looked slightly embarrassed. Molly 
looked at the eager girls and sighed, resigned. &quot;Yes,&quot; Molly admitted, 
&quot;I also seem to have his feelings, but I have absolutely no plans to 
act on &#39;em.&quot; Raye looked almost sympathetic, and the others provided 
their consolations, all except Serena, who was giving Molly the oddest 
look. A short time later, after Serena had gone out for some air, 
Molly followed her outside. &quot;Serena, it&#39;s all right,&quot; Molly said, 
&quot;things don&#39;t have to be different between us.&quot; Serena looked at her 
with a very anguished expression, and Molly held her close. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry,&quot; Molly said with a choked voice, &quot;I&#39;ll leave you alone.&quot;

Serena stopped her, and looked up into her eyes as she said, &quot;Darien 
and I broke up for good a few weeks ago, and now I look at you, and 
see how much of what I loved was the Prince, Tuxedo Mask. The way you 
move, the toss of you head, the attitude, it&#39;s all there, and I don&#39;t 
have the slightest idea what to do about it.&quot; Molly smiled down to 
her, tempted to take advantage, but she stopped herself.

&quot;Serena,&quot; she said, &quot;this isn&#39;t the time for you to make any 
decisions. You&#39;ve just had a shock and need time to deal with it. 
Heck, I&#39;m still trying to deal with it!&quot; she said with a smile. 
&quot;You&#39;re my friend, and I don&#39;t want to do anything to change that.&quot;
