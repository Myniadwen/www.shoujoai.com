<a href="../smoon/ootime-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>NEW FEELINGS  

The walk to the shrine was refreshing. The snow was falling lazily 
over her  shoulders and her soft blonde hair, slowly melting in cold 
water at the  contact of her warm skin. Everything in the park turned 
in a bluish color  under the light of the moon, even the deep green of 
the pine trees that  circled the playground, and she was so caught up 
in her thoughts, that she  found herself at the entrance of the shrine 
without even noticing the burning  sensation in her calves after the 
exhausting steps that lead to the top of   the hill where the building 
was settled. 

Rei was looking at her with dreamy  eyes. She always liked her, and it 
was such a strong feeling that she had to  concentrate not to let it 
show, and it would come out as she was aggravated  at her, always on 
the verge of getting upset at every word, mistake or  clumsiness that 
Usagi would show, even though she loved every step she&#39;d make. But it 
was the only way to hide it. And it worked out pretty well. 

&quot;Hi! Usagi you&#39;re soaked! Did you have to come walking on a night like 
this???&quot; 

&quot;Ok, ok, miss grumpy, I&#39;m glad to see you too&quot; said Usagi mocking 
Rei&#39;s voice. 

&quot;Come in, and don&#39;t be such a clown, I want to tell you about this as 
soon  as possible so you won&#39;t be late to your date&quot; 

&quot;well...we decided to cancel it for today, Darien is too tired after 
college, and is better for us to take a break once in a while&quot; -Again 
lying?  

&#39;Well, this was the last one for today&#39;, she thought.  

&quot;Is everything alright?&quot; Rei sounded more gentle than usual, but she 
wouldn&#39;t  fight it this time. Not tonight, she was too tired. Usagi 
looked at her and,  for the first time, she realized how beautiful she 
was. Her voice was sweet  and soothing when she wasn&#39;t angry, with her 
features showing a mix of  delicate sensuality that caught her by 
surprise so fast that she couldn&#39;t  say a word, leaving the room in a 
akward silence. 

The wind whistled softly  from outside. Her dark hair moved along with 
the breeze, and Usagi stood still, hypnotized by the magic of the 
moment, with a sensation of vertigo  grabbing her, deeply in her 
chest. 

Rei&#39;s heart pounded harder, and she  realized she was starting to 
sigh, so she went to the door and closed it with a loud &quot;slam&quot; and 
walking towards the kitchen she said &quot;I&#39;ll prepare  some tea, you must 
be freezing...&quot; 

&quot;...thanks...&quot; 

she never felt so peaceful in her life as she was feeling in  that 
moment. It was like in that minute when they were looking at each 
other,  they floated in a comforting levitation that took away the 
burden she was  bringing on her back.  

&quot;...your hair is still wet...&quot; 

the tray made a chiming sound of teacups and  teaspoons, and Usagi 
touched her head with a shy hand, &#39;oh, I look awful...&#39;  thought 
discovering herself worried about her looks in front of someone  that 
knew her for so long. 

&quot;do you want to stay here tonight?...&quot; And after seeing a slight blush 
on her  friend&#39;s face, Rei forgot about the fire readings, and that 
disturbance on  the Gates of Time she perceived a few hours before.

------------------------------------------------------------

The house was warm and quiet. Nobody else seemed to be there besides 
them.  She sat her on the couch and took off her jacket, kneeled in 
front of her  and look at her sad expression. 

&quot;I need to change this clothes and so should  you. I&#39;ll find something 
for you to put on while we dry up your uniform.&quot;  

Minako looked at the gorgeous young woman, and felt ashamed for her 
behavior  out on the street. She used to be so cheerful all the time, 
and had to bump  into her just when she was feeling so depressed... 

&#39;this is not my day&#39;. 

Setsuna came back from her room already changed, with a sweatshirt and 
a skirt tugged in her arms.  &quot;I know is not too trendy but it will fit 
you in the meantime&quot; she smiled at  her with that glow that shines 
only in persons that don&#39;t do that too often.  

&quot;Thank you Setsuna-san, I&#39;m sorry we met in such a lousy way, I always 
loved talking to you, I wish you wouldn&#39;t have seen me like this, you 
must think  I&#39;m a mess&quot; 

&quot;well, I hope you would tell me what&#39;s going on. You didn&#39;t come to 
visit me for over a month now, and I was missing our talks. You know 
you can trust  me, what&#39;s bothering you so much?&quot; She tilted her head 
and her long hair fell on her shoulder. 

&quot;I prefer not to talk about it now, I think I will when I feel better&quot; 
And Minako avoided her gaze one more time, like she  would do since 
she started feeling attracted to the Guardian of the Gates  of Time. 
She fell in love with the unreachable, with the one destined to be  
alone for eternity, with the impossible. 

&quot;I respect your privacy, I only want you to know that I&#39;ll be always 
here  to listen to you, I found a dear friend in you, you always 
surprise me with  something, you&#39;re spontaneous and completely 
unpredictable, and you know that&#39;s amazing for me&quot; she caressed her 
face with a delicate hand, and led  her upstairs so she could change 
clothes. Minako was an attractive young woman. 

&#39;She&#39;s so mature now&#39; Setsuna found  herself leaning on the kitchen 
counter distracted by her train of thoughts.  

She remembered her vision from the last night. It was a message from 
the future, but she just could recall a song, that was on the radio 
when she woke up. She shouldn&#39;t forget to turn the radio off before 
going to sleep.  

Lately, it was bringing her nightmares. And today, she was feeling 
powerless,  without visions or perceptions, completely diverted by her 
encounter with  the blonde senshi of love, whom she was growing so 
attached to lately.  </pre>
