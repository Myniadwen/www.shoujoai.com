Hotaru Tomoe frowned as she watched the monitors, her
eyes grim as she observed the data feed of the battle
that they had tapped into from the AD Police. &quot;I see
Usagi Tsukino has been reinstated,&quot; she noted quietly,
black hair flowing over her shoulders.

&quot;Chief Haruna called her in, I believe,&quot; Kaori agreed
as she drank her tea, both of them sitting in the
executive office, &quot;she&#39;s one of the most experienced
officers they have, even if she is often
insubordinate.&quot; The redhead looked over at the
president of Infinity as she quietly asked, &quot;Did the
combat Bio-boomer shout what I think it did?&quot;

&quot;Mistress Nine,&quot; Hotaru agreed grimly, rubbing at her
eyes tiredly.

&quot;But...&quot; Kaori hesitated, &quot;I thought that Mistress
Nine was still asleep, sealed away?&quot;

Touching a key on her control panel Hotaru cut away
from the battle even as the military Bio-boomer fell
to the Senshi Sabers, the image changing to a round
chamber off in the distance, a figure faintly visible
within it. Various kinds of data scrolled along the
bottom of the screen, monitoring energy levels, air
quality and dozens of other factors.

&quot;The computers say that she&#39;s in there,&quot; Hotaru said
quietly. She got up, pacing the room as she continued,
&quot;But we both know computers can be fooled.&quot;

Kaori nodded reluctantly. Early on Hotaru had accessed
Infinity&#39;s computer systems, spreading across
Megatokyo to eliminate any data relating to the Saturn
project or the death of the original Hotaru Tomoe,
planting modified files in the process. It was
unlikely that any of the original data remained, much
less in a useful form. Getting up from her seat she
said, &quot;Do you think we need to do an on site
inspection?&quot;

Hotaru smiled, glad to see her assistant was
anticipating her once again. &quot;Well, I do,&quot; she said,
&quot;but I need you to say here.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Kaori surprised her.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Hotaru raised her eyebrow, &quot;I thought that I
gave you an order.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t let you go alone,&quot; Kaori said softly.
Hesitantly she continued, &quot;I&#39;m not a technical type,
but even I can see how similar the Saturn and Mistress
Nine designs are... she could influence you, even
without you being aware of it.&quot;

&quot;And Nine could kill you,&quot; Hotaru said softly, &quot;or
worse.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a chance I&#39;m willing to take,&quot; Kaori said,
meeting her eyes with absolute honesty.

Hotaru sighed, wondering how she could have so quickly
inspired such loyalty in her. &#39;Or maybe it&#39;s just that
I&#39;m an improvement over Father,&#39; she thought
uncharitably. &quot;All right,&quot; she finally gave in, &quot;but
you&#39;re going prepared.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Kaori blinked.

Not long afterward a Infinity company car left the
building, Hotaru in the driver&#39;s seat as they moved
through the streets of Megatokyo. &quot;So how does it
feel?&quot; she asked, looking over at her passenger
thoughtfully.

&quot;Uncomfortable,&quot; Kaori sighed. She had exchanged her
business wear for a suit of combat armor, several
grades higher than what the AD Police could afford.
Bulletproof, impact absorbent and even fire resistant
it was a marvel of engineering, if a bit hard to wear.

Hotaru chuckled softly, &quot;Sorry, it&#39;s necessary.&quot; She
tapped a section of armor mounted on the arm, &quot;This
might buy you enough time to get clear if things go
bad.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Kaori sighed. She looked off into the distance,
gathering her thoughts, then quietly said, &quot;Let&#39;s see
if I&#39;ve gotten this straight. Mistress Nine was
created after Uranus and Saturn, and was your
prototype?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Hotaru nodded, &quot;my dear Father was working on a
improved brain design, and downloaded the Hotaru files
to it as he developed her. Apparently something was
wrong with her design, and when she awoke she was
fully insane.&quot;

&quot;My god,&quot; Kaori murmured, &quot;how did he cover it up?&quot;

&quot;As the self-named Mistress Nine was murdering her way
through the facility Tomoe managed to lure her into a
containment unit,&quot; Hotaru revealed coolly. &quot;He escaped
the facility then used a prototype weapon to destroy
the building, in the process setting off a major quake
that swept across the whole city.&quot;

&quot;Incredible,&quot; Kaori breathed out.

&quot;In the confusion Father concealed all evidence of
Infinity&#39;s involvement,&quot; Hotaru continued. A grim
smile, &quot;The cynical bastard even used the quake to
make Infinity look good, stepping in to offer disaster
relief.&quot;

Kaori nodded, putting that data together with other
things she had learned. &quot;And that was when the Uranus
and Neptune prototypes escaped?&quot; she asked.

They entered the bad part of town, a section where the
damage from the quake hadn&#39;t yet been erased. &quot;They
were taken,&quot; Hotaru corrected her as she drove on,
&quot;though I have my suspicions as to who had done so.&quot;

&quot;Ami Mizuno?&quot; Kaori asked.

&quot;She wasn&#39;t active just then, though I suspect she was
finishing the Senshi Saber suits at the time,&quot; Hotaru
said as they slowed to a stop nearby a broken subway
entrance. &quot;No, I think it was the missing Pluto
prototype that did it.&quot; She opened the door and got
out, &quot;We&#39;ll have to walk from here.&quot;

&quot;Professor Tomoe believed Pluto had been destroyed,&quot;
Kaori sounded a bit dubious as she got out then went
into the back seat. The cannon she had checked out
from Infinity&#39;s security department was comfortable in
her hands, a magnetic rail gun designed to damage even
the toughest of the Bio-boomers.

While she lead the way down the subway stairs Hotaru
said, &quot;He hoped that Pluto was destroyed, but Father
never knew for sure.&quot; They carefully navigated down,
past fallen stone and across cracked pavement, then
down into the unused tunnels that once criss-crossed
the city.

Kaori checked the map on her data pad, noting how
Hotaru was unerringly navigating them to the buried
chamber. &#39;Did she memorize the map,&#39; she wondered, &#39;or
are Hotaru&#39;s instincts leading her right to her...
sister?&#39;

&quot;Here,&quot; Hotaru said as they reached a section of
collapsed tunnel.

&quot;Should I...?&quot; Kaori raised her gun meaningfully
towards the wall.

&quot;No,&quot; Hotaru shook her head, &quot;let me.&quot;

With startling swiftness Hotaru struck the wall with a
first, stone chips flying with the force of her blow.
Again and again she punched, stone cracking loudly,
until finally the section broke away revealing a dark,
musty tunnel beyond.

&quot;You&#39;re bleeding,&quot; Kaori hurried forward, swiftly
bandaging her bleeding knuckles, winding white cloth
over the broken skin.

Hotaru blinked at her in surprise, then smiled
slightly. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said softly, meeting
Kaori&#39;s eyes.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Kaori looked away, blushing faintly.

Without another word they headed out, moving into the
darkness. Climbing over broken stone and around fallen
beams they eventually made their way to the wreckage
of the research facility, sunk beneath the city by
Infinity&#39;s earthquake device. Navigating the halls
they made their way inside, the musty scent of decay
in the air.

&quot;Urk,&quot; Kaori fought the urge to be ill as they stepped
over the remains of a few of Mistress Nine&#39;s victims,
the passage of time not erasing the horror from those
dried out faces.

Hotaru put a comforting hand on her arm, &quot;Not much
farther.&quot;

The center of the facility had a containment chamber,
one that had been designed to hold the unpredictable
results of some Bio-boomer experiments. Specially
coated the chamber should have been able to contain
nearly any biological material known to man. As they
entered the outer room a wave of stench hit them, and
both women knew something was wrong.

&quot;No,&quot; Kaori breathed out.

The entire side of the chamber had been dissolved
away, the metal and ceramics used to form stairs
leading up and out of the room. The bodies of the
staff were scattered about, some almost looking like
they had been... eaten.

Hotaru looked around the room with as much detachment
as she could manage, though it was clear she was
shaken, too. &quot;So Mistress Nine is free,&quot; she said
harshly, &quot;and by the looks of things, it&#39;s been
awhile.&quot;

&quot;What do we do now?&quot; Kaori asked, clutching her gun
nervously.

&quot;Contact Ami Mizuno and the Senshi Sabers,&quot; Hotaru
said grimly, &quot;and pray they know how to contact Pluto,
Uranus and Neptune. We&#39;ll need all the help we can get
to stop this thing.&quot;</pre>
