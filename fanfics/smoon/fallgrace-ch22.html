<h1>Fallen from Grace (part 22 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blue.html">BluestAngelDust</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/fallgrace-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>Rei stared at the smooth, wooden surface of her desk, attention 
obviously elsewhere.

It was over. They were over.

Did it ever really start? There can&#39;t be an end if there was no 
beginning. Just like there can&#39;t be an end with Hotaru if she didn&#39;t 
know when they started to exist. So, she&#39;ll carry these feelings for the 
girl for the rest of her life.

Just another one to add to the list.

God, it hurt. Hurt like a bitch. Love only brought pain, but she knew 
that already. She was just too stupid to remember and heed the warning. 
Stupid enough to fall again.

&quot;Hino-san?&quot;

The businesswoman shook herself from her reverie and looked up to find a 
young woman standing at her door. She forced the pain to disappear from 
her eyes, using her mask, perfected through the years, to hide her 
turmoil.

&quot;Yes, Chiharu?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s a young lady here to see you-&quot;

&quot;Let me in! Let me talk to Hino! I&#39;m going to kill her!&quot;

Rei frowned and stood, the voice strangely familiar. She walked to her 
door, Chiharu looking quite shocked as she stared in the direction of 
the elevator. Lavender eyes followed her gaze to find...

Megumi, surrounded by five security guards, fuming while Kenji tried to 
calm her in vain. The entire office was staring at the raging girl with 
interest.

Rei felt a sigh escape her lips, causing her secretary to look at her in 
concern.

&quot;Chiharu, please show her into my office.&quot;

&quot;H-Hino-san?&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; the tired woman said before re-entering her office.

A short while later, the door opened and in stepped Megumi, whose eyes 
narrowed upon seeing the businesswoman making tea.

&quot;You may go, Chiharu. Hold all my calls.&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot;

Rei heard the door close and turned to the college student, her face the 
epitome of confidence and stoicism.

&quot;Would you like some tea?&quot;

Megumi&#39;s eyes narrowed some more when she heard the cool and polite 
tone. Did it really not matter to Hino that she broke Hotaru&#39;s heart? 
The anger within her grew.

&quot;No, thank you.&quot;

The businesswoman was surprised at how professional, though forced, the 
young woman sounded. She even managed to hide most of her anger. Most.

&quot;Very well. Please, sit.&quot;

The college student complied, as reluctant as she was. Rei walked over 
to the couch, facing her guest as she sat down and crossed her legs.

Silence descended over the pair, the older woman having no problem with 
it, though. Ten years has given her ample time to rid herself of her 
hatred of awkward silences. Being in the business world has helped, 
also.

&quot;How could you?&quot; Megumi whispered heatedly.

Pleased that the brunette broke the silence first, Rei arched a fine 
brow in question.

&#39;That&#39;s it, Hino, pretend your heart isn&#39;t breaking. Pretend you don&#39;t 
feel this hurt.&#39;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; she asked instead.

Megumi stood, blue eyes coming to life as the flame of anger danced 
within her.

&quot;What do I mean? What do I mean! Why you heartless bitc-&quot;

&quot;I suggest you watch your language. If we can not conduct this in a 
civilized manner, we won&#39;t at all.&quot;

The miko only seemed to inflame the younger girl more. Her fists 
clenched at her sides as her eyes narrowed.

&quot;In a civilized manner? After what you did to Hotaru?&quot;

The hurt inside Rei stirred to life at those words. What she did to 
Hotaru? Was she the one that left? No, it wasn&#39;t.

&quot;And what exactly did I do to her?&quot;

Before the businesswoman could blink, Megumi had made her way over to 
her and pulled the miko to her feet by her collar. Lavender eyes danced 
at the threat.

&quot;You little bitch. What did you do? What did you do? You cried out your 
ex-girlfriend&#39;s name after having sex with Hotaru!&quot;

Megumi watched as Rei&#39;s eyes widened with disbelief and the anger in the 
lavender orbs disappeared. The businesswoman&#39;s expression turned from 
one of controlled annoyance to complete shock as her body stiffened. The 
brunette&#39;s mouth went dry as she released the woman&#39;s shirt.

&quot;Oh my god, you didn&#39;t know.&quot;

Rei collapsed into the chair she occupied seconds ago. No, she couldn&#39;t 
have... she wouldn&#39;t have...

The college student shook her head. She pitied Hino. She had what she 
wanted, better than she deserved, and she screwed it up. She hadn&#39;t even 
known how, until now.

God, she fucked up. Beyond her wildest imagination. It all made so much 
sense now. Why Haruka was so mad, why Hotaru had left. She&#39;d hate her 
too if she were the college student.

But Rei didn&#39;t even know why she whispered Minako&#39;s name. It had been 
the only night she didn&#39;t dream about the blonde. She didn&#39;t dream at 
all, to be honest.

All that she remembered was pulling Hotaru close to her after their... 
activities. They were both exhausted, panting as sweat cloaked their 
bodies. Hotaru&#39;s arms were wrapped around her waist while hers were 
instinctively snaked around her slim shoulders.

She had nuzzled the younger girl&#39;s neck, kissing the marks she made 
before. Hot breath caressed her skin as her lover sighed contently, 
causing a goofy grin to touch her lips.

Next thing she knew, Hotaru&#39;s breathing evened, informing her that the 
girl had fallen asleep. She couldn&#39;t help but smile. She was hers. She 
didn&#39;t know how long she stared at the beautiful and peaceful face 
before falling asleep herself.

How could she have screwed up between then and waking up? It was 
impossible. Well, not for her, it seemed.

Hotaru. Her Hotaru was hurting far more than she was. Was she even hers 
anymore? No, no she wasn&#39;t. But she had to get her back.

Megumi watched the older woman as she sat perfectly still, as if 
debating within herself. She hated the pity she felt for the miko, since 
she was loyal to Hotaru, but she did feel it and didn&#39;t ever want to be 
in her position.

The lavender eyes slowly refocused, the fire burning within then flaring 
to life. They turned to the college student, forcing the brunette to 
take a step back from their intensity.

&quot;How is she?&quot;

The cool tone shocked Megumi, causing her anger to rise again. What the 
hell was up with Hino? Was she made of stone? The angry student opened 
her mouth to retort when she saw the flicker of concern in the intense 
purple eyes.

&#39;Damn it, Hino, if you don&#39;t start showing your feelings, you&#39;ll never 
get her back.&#39;

Megumi didn&#39;t know when she started rooting for Hino. She used to hate 
her, and still do, but she couldn&#39;t help but feel that the two belonged 
together. Like they were meant to be or something. And as much as she 
disliked the businesswoman, she made Hotaru happy. Truly happy, in a way 
that not even Sara did.

&quot;She&#39;s in pretty bad shape.&quot;

Rei closed her eyes and nodded. She remembered how Hotaru looked 
yesterday. God, she fucked up.

&quot;She threw away the necklace, you know,&quot; Megumi whispered softly.

Rei stiffened and she stopped breathing for a moment. She threw away the 
necklace. That was the symbol of what they had. Did she really want to 
end it all? Did she even have the right to try to get back what they 
had? Did Hotaru want it back?

&quot;She needs you, Hino, as much as I hate to admit it.&quot;

Megumi started for the door, her hair standing on end when she felt the 
other woman&#39;s eyes on her but kept walking. She tried to keep her tone 
neutral.

&quot;Sara, Hikari and I all know it. You don&#39;t deserve her, but for some 
reason, you make her happy. You make her smile, make her laugh, make her 
nervous and make her feel everything a person feels when they&#39;re in 
love. No one but you do that to her. She deserves to feel love, to know 
what it&#39;s like to love.&quot;

The brunette paused at the door.

&quot;We&#39;ll do what we can. But you better come up with something, Hino. And 
fast.&quot;

----------------------------------

Rei put out her cigarette before rubbing her tired eyes. The clock at 
the bottom of her computer screen read 3:45 AM.

&#39;All right, Hino. Time to catch four hours of sleep. You don&#39;t want to 
be a zombie tomorrow, now do you?&#39;

The woman shut off her computer and rose to her feet, her neck sore and 
her back stiff beyond description. She groaned softly before stretching, 
bones cracking loudly and muscles protesting the movements.

She was getting old, no doubt about it. Even her senshi healing couldn&#39;t 
reverse all the damage she&#39;s done to her body in the past couple of 
years. Let her current state be a lesson to the youth: drugs, alcohol 
and smoking combined with irregular amounts of sleep, overworking and 
clubbing wreaks havoc on your health, even if your body is supposed to 
have one of the best counter measurements, like magical healing.

Chuckling to herself, the miko made her way over to the large couch in 
the middle of the room. She grabbed a blanket from under the cushion of 
the armchair before sitting down.

As she took off her boots, her tired mind told her she really did owe 
Utena one for buying such a comfortable couch for her. The one she had 
before was gorgeous, but about as comfortable as a rock.

The miko lay down, covering herself with the blanket and sighing softly. 
Without meaning to, her mind drifted back to when Megumi stormed into 
her office and told her what she had done.

She didn&#39;t have a clue why she whispered Minako&#39;s name then and she 
still didn&#39;t now.

But she knew how Hotaru felt: betrayed and stupid. Betrayed by a woman 
she cared for deeply, to whom their relationship seemingly meant 
nothing.

Stupid for believing in love, for loving so much. Stupid for taking a 
chance and leaping when you knew there was no solid ground to land on.

She knew how it felt better than she wanted to. Minako... God, why was 
she always the source of her troubles? She knew she was putting blame on 
the blonde she didn&#39;t deserve, but damn it, she was the Goddess of Love. 
Why hadn&#39;t she known her own heart better? Well, at least she found 
Hotaru-

Rei sat up suddenly, eyes wide. That&#39;s it. It had to be.

Without another thought, the woman put on her boots, grabbed her purse 
and ran out of the dark office.

----------------------------------

The second the door opened and lavender eyes caught sight of blonde 
hair, Rei walked in without an invitation. She walked straight into the 
living room, ignoring the surprised look on Minako&#39;s face.

&quot;Minako, thank god you&#39;re home. I fucked up this time, God did I ever. 
But then again, you probably knew that because you&#39;re the only one that 
can get anything out of Setsuna, so I&#39;ll skip the details. But damn it, 
I&#39;m so stupid. No, stupid doesn&#39;t sum it up. I&#39;m a moron, a complete 
retard, the biggest idiot in the world and I really need your help-&quot;

The rambling woman came to a screeching halt when she saw Setsuna 
standing by the entrance of the living room. It wasn&#39;t seeing her that 
shocked Rei, she knew the two had been living together for a few years 
now.

No, it was the fact that the senshi of Time looked anything but sleepy, 
her eyes smoky with anger and something Rei was very familiar with and 
her usually perfect hair was a mess.

Oh, that the fact that she only had a sheet wrapped around her.

Slowly, Rei turned to inspect her ex-girlfriend, who was pretty much in 
the same condition, except she was trying to tie her robe. Her nose 
detected a familiar scent.

The miko looked away and blinked a few times before looking up at the 
ceiling. She covered her face with both hands before groaning and 
shaking her head in frustration. Nothing was going her way.

She then removed her hands and let out a groan/growl that conveyed her 
annoyance. Her gaze wandered over the tall, silent beauty to her right, 
who stared at her with those intense, red eyes of hers. Rei smiled 
apologetically and waved, to which the other woman responded with a nod.

The nervous smile disappeared and the businesswoman&#39;s expression twisted 
to betray her embarrassment and guilt.

&quot;God, I am so sorry, you two. I figured you&#39;d be asleep since it&#39;s... 
4:30 in the morning, so I&#39;d be waking you two up instead of 
interrupting- um... yeah.&quot;

The miko started making gestures at the door while she looked back and 
forth between the two women.

&quot;I&#39;ll just be going now. Very, very sorry. Just forget I ever came and 
return to-&quot;

She was practically at the door when the oldest senshi&#39;s calm voice 
spoke.

&quot;Rei, sit.&quot;

The bad-tempered woman turned to find the other woman&#39;s red eyes 
glittering faintly with annoyance and curiosity. Setsuna then turned and 
disappeared while her lover shrugged and shut the door, effectively 
trapping her ex.

As her blonde host took a seat, the miko relented and sat down on the 
large couch. There was silence for a few minutes before Minako, 
understandably annoyed, spoke.

&quot;So, why are you here this early in the morning?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you know?&quot; Rei retorted bitterly before she could stop herself.

&quot;No, she doesn&#39;t,&quot; came the Guardian of Time&#39;s slightly annoyed voice as 
she re-entered with a tray of tea. &quot;Neither do I, actually.&quot;

The dark-haired businesswoman bit her tongue to prevent a sarcastic 
response from escaping. She was here to ask the two for help, not a time 
to mock Setsuna.

&quot;Oh?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I&#39;ve been trying to keep myself from seeing everything lately.&quot;

Rei arched a brow as she sipped the tea she was handed.

&quot;So, the omniscient Pluto isn&#39;t omniscient anymore. The things you do 
for the one you love...&quot;

The red-eyed woman felt her lover tense beside her and saw her open her 
mouth to comment on the miko&#39;s rude remark when she stopped her. The 
playful smirk on the younger senshi&#39;s lips told her it was just a 
friendly jab, but her girlfriend obviously took it otherwise.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, that was uncalled for,&quot; the lavender-eyed woman apologized 
with a soft sigh. &quot;It just hasn&#39;t been my week.&quot;

Minako once again opened her mouth, this time to say that her ex has 
been this way to her lover ever since she found out about the two of 
them but stopped herself. After all, Rei must be in pretty bad shape to 
come to them, of all people.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Setsuna said dismissively. &quot;I knew something was going 
to happen tonight, but not what exactly... or when.&quot;

The miko blushed softly.

&quot;I really am sorry...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, there&#39;s always after you leave.&quot;

The Guardian of Time tried to hide her blush by drink her tea. Rei just 
rolled her eyes at the Goddess of Love.

&quot;Aye, you love your sex.&quot;

It was getting harder and harder for the oldest of the three women to 
keep her composure. She did not image herself sitting in her living room 
at 5 in the morning while her lover&#39;s ex commented on her 
girlfriend&#39;s... ah, hobbies.

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t be talking,&quot; the blonde singer responded.

&quot;No,&quot; Rei responded wistfully. &quot;I suppose not. Actually, that&#39;s part of 
the reason I came to talk to you two.&quot;

Minako arched a brow but didn&#39;t comment as her friend fidgeted. She knew 
her girlfriend was just as confused as to why their friend was here at 5 
in the morning.

&quot;Oh?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. You see, I kinda... slept with Hotaru.&quot;

Setsuna started to cough furiously when the tea she was drinking went 
down the wrong way. Minako, though shocked, still had enough of her 
senses to pat her lover on the back.

&quot;You what?&quot; the blonde asked, a dumbfound expression on her pretty face.

&quot;I slept with Hotaru.&quot;

&quot;When?&quot; the oldest senshi forced out.

&quot;Six days ago.&quot;

&quot;Wow.&quot;

The three fell silent after Minako&#39;s &quot;comment.&quot; Rei shifted in her seat. 
What if Setsuna decided to kill her? Maybe she should have thought this 
through.

&quot;Okay, what exactly do you need help with?&quot;

&quot;I uh...&quot; the miko gulped, &quot;kind of whispered your name the next 
morning.&quot;

&quot;You what?&quot;

The miko winced at Setsuna&#39;s angry and shocked tone. She didn&#39;t blame 
the older woman. Not only did she sleep with her adoptive daughter, but 
she whispered her lover&#39;s name as well. This was getting more than a 
little awkward.

&quot;But I don&#39;t know why,&quot; Rei said as she stood and began to pace. &quot;I 
wasn&#39;t thinking about Minako. I wasn&#39;t really thinking period! I mean, I 
had no reason to whisper Mina&#39;s name.&quot;

The miko walked over to the shocked blonde, took her face into her hands 
and kissed her. Kissed her long and rough.

&quot;See?&quot; Rei exclaimed when she pulled away and continued to rant, leaving 
a breathless Minako and a rather enraged Setsuna. &quot;Nothing. I felt 
absolutely nothing. No fireworks, no thunder, no life altering feelings 
and no goose bumps! N-O-T-H-I-N-G! Nothing.&quot;

The miko slumped onto the couch, the hysteria in her voice gone, leaving 
her looking lost and confused.

&quot;Not a single thing.&quot;

Lavender eyes turned to look at her blonde ex, burning with a 
desperation the other woman&#39;s rarely seen.

&quot;I&#39;ve loved you for 10 years. That&#39;s 3652 days. That&#39;s 87648 hours.&quot;

Rei stood as the silent couple watched her, unsure of what to say or do. 
She walked over to the window, looking out as her fists clenched at her 
sides. Her strained voice was barely a whisper when she spoke again.

&quot;And suddenly I realize I care for, even love, someone else. God, can 
you imagine what that&#39;s like? She made her way into my heart without my 
notice, showed me love when I thought I&#39;d feel it again and then bam! I 
care about her, I love her- love her when I thought I&#39;d given up.&quot;

Minako looked over at her beautiful lover and squeezed her hand. Did she 
ever know that feeling, better than Rei thought.

&quot;And then I fucked it up,&quot; the miko added, slamming her fist into the 
wall as the frustration returned to her voice. &quot;I fucked up bad. God, 
how could I? I thought I was ready to give Hotaru a chance, but... but I 
obviously wasn&#39;t.&quot;

The frenzy the lavender-eyed woman worked herself into left her, leaving 
her tired as she looked down at her hands.

&quot;I suppose there&#39;s one thing I have to do before I can move on. Before I 
can give Hotaru all of myself.&quot;

Rei turned to look at Minako, her eyes burning with an intensity that 
swallowed the blonde whole. Setsuna squeezed her lover&#39;s hand, telling 
her she was right next to her. The miko walked over, knelt down and took 
her friend&#39;s other hand in her own, voice soft and eyes pleading.

&quot;When you left me... did you still love me?&quot;

The blonde closed her eyes and shook her head in disbelief, her voice 
trembling.

&quot;Oh... Rei...&quot;

&quot;No, really,&quot; the miko begged. &quot;Did you?&quot;

The senshi of Love gazed adoringly at her friend, whose need to know 
reflected in her face and the hurt she still felt in her eyes. She 
turned to Setsuna, who just smiled and nodded.

&quot;God, Rei,&quot; the blonde whispered softly, caressing her ex&#39;s cheek. &quot;Of 
course, I did.&quot;

The miko let out a breath she hadn&#39;t known she was holding and smiled, 
tears running down her face as she leaned into the touch.

&quot;Then thank you.&quot;

Minako felt tears welling up in her eyes.

&quot;For what?&quot;

&quot;For letting me go when you still loved me.&quot;

Rei looked up to find both the leader of the Inner Senshi and the 
Guardian of Time staring at her in shock. She smiled.

&quot;Because you knew I was destined to be with Hotaru.&quot;

The blonde singer opened her mouth when her lover asked the question on 
both their minds.

&quot;How did you know?&quot;

The miko just grinned.

&quot;I know Minako better than everyone thinks.&quot;

Her expression turned desperate, the frustration back in her eyes.

&quot;Will you two please help me get Hotaru back? Please?&quot;

The blue-eyed woman smiled down at the anxious woman and placed a loving 
kiss on her friend&#39;s brow.

&quot;Of course.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That was fast, wasn&#39;t it? You can thank Sailor Doc. Why? Because Sailor 
Doc reviewed. Now go read &quot;Echoes of a Distant Demon&quot; if you haven&#39;t 
already.

Oh, bobcat reference was from &quot;Two Weeks&#39; Notice&quot; starring Sandra 
Bullock and Hugh Grant. Not the world&#39;s best movie, but I liked it.

Title for the chapter comes from &quot;Ticket to Heaven&quot; by 3 Doors Down. I 
think it fits how Rei feels at this point.</pre>
