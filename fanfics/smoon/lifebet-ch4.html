<h1>Life Just Gets Better (part 4 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/lifebet-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&#147; Serena&#133;wake up.&#148; Darien shook his girlfriend gently. Serena just 
moaned and sleepily opened her eyes. 

&#147; Good morning Darien. Is it time for breakfast?&#148;

&#147; Yes so get up or the others will start with out us!&#148; Serena shot up 
and ran to the closet looking for clothes to put on.

&#147; What are you doing?&#148;

&#147; Getting dressed!&#148; 

&#147; Serena everyone will still be in their pajamas. Terri never got 
dressed for breakfast and she most likely doesn&#146;t now.&#148; He watched in 
amusement as Serena walked out the room in a sluggish way. Darien 
followed after.

Surely enough there was Terri. Decked out in a black tank top and 
matching sweat pants. The nine girls looked up at the two arriving. 

- Wait a minute?! Nine girls?- Serena looked around. Across from the 
inner scouts were the outer scouts, sitting at the table. 

&#147; Uh, hey guys! When did you get here?&#148;

&#147; Good morning kitten. We got here after you went to bed.&#148; Amara 
looked at the Princess. &#147; Oh&#148; was all she said as she took her place 
by Darien. 

&#147; You two are late. Did Serenity almost get dressed?&#148; A blush tinted 
Serena&#146;s cheeks as the others laughed. 

&#147; That answers my question. Well eat hardy cuz today is our first 
training session!&#148;

The food was brought in and everyone ate. Chatting about many subjects 
at once.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When everyone was finished, they followed Terri to a very high 
ceiling, white room. The room was huge! Perfect for Senshi training. 

&#147; Okay, first I want you all to know that I am the outer Princess. 
Amara, Michelle, Setsuna, &amp; Hotaru are my protectors. Now with out 
further ado I will show you my Senshi form.&#148;

Terri reached in her subspace pocket. She brought out a blue-blackish 
stone. One side flat the other slightly rounded. Terri brought it in 
front of her. Holding the stone between two fingers, she threw it like 
a card. A second later she yelled &#147; Terrestrial Universe&#148;. The stone 
stopped, flat side facing her. Then shot periwinkle light at her. 
Silver stars formed around her, inching closer. The stars attached 
themselves to her. Covering her completely, and without warning 
detached and there stood a new Senshi. The collar, skirt,&amp; boots were 
periwinkle, along with the belt above the skirt. (think eternal sailor 
moon.) In the middle of the belt was her stone. The top of her boots 
were white. The outfit had no sleeves. The front bow was evergreen 
with another black-blue stone there. Surprisingly the back bow was 
black. Her tiara silver, with a smaller version of her stone in the 
center. Lastly her hair was pulled into a high ponytail, which then 
split into two other ponytails down her back. 

&#147; So what do you think?&#148; Sailor Terrestrial looked at her friends. 
They were in total awe. Again she blushed from the attention. 

&#147; Well if you find that shocking, what do you call this?&#148; They looked 
at her quizzically. Terrestrial snapped her fingers and from her back 
came black angel wings.

&#147;WHAT?!?!&#148; The shock on their faces earlier was nothing compare to 
their shock now. 

&#147; *giggle* Don&#145;t I look good in black?&#148;

She raised her hand, waved it at them and stones appeared in front of 
the others. 

&#147; These are yours. Shout your planet then Universe. This is your final 
and most powerful form.&#148;

Everyone transformed. Their outfits were styled the same as 
Terrestrial&#146;s. Darien simply wore his armor minus the cape.

&#147; You will train now. I will watch and discover your weaknesses. 
Here&#146;s how you will pair off: Endymion&amp; Serenity, Mars&amp; Mercury, 
Jupiter&amp; Venus, Uranus&amp; Neptune, and Pluto&amp; Saturn. Remember that you 
can&#146;t hurt each other. You will automatically know your knew attacks. 
Go!&#148; 

Sailor Terrestrial flew upwards, watching like a hawk. After a half 
hour the only ones making progress were Mars&amp; Mercury. - Well this 
won&#146;t do&#133;.- 

&#147; People! You can&#146;t hurt each other! See, watch.&#148;

She held her hands in front of her chest. Then she called her attack 
&#147;Universe Implode!&#148;. The attack went straight for Serenity. There was 
a loud boom when the attack made contact. Sailor Moon screamed as well 
as everyone else. When the smoke cleared there was a large X on her 
head. She wasn&#146;t harmed. 

&#147; See? Can&#146;t hurt each other, so don&#146;t hold back! Oh and if you want 
your wings just snapped your fingers. It might hurt since it&#146;s your 
first time. Now spare until someone loses!&#148; Terrestrial flew back 
upward and watched. In the end Endymion, Mercury, Venus, Neptune, and 
Pluto lost. They made at least some progress.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the rest of the week they spared every morning, then just hung 
around the mansion. By the end of the week the four Outers had taken 
Terri&#146;s invitation to move in. 

Everyone&#146;s lives fell into routine with their training hours. Then the 
first battle came. A month into they&#146;re new lives.</pre>
