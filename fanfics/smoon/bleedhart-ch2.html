<h1>Bleeding Hearts (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/vbabe.html">Sailor V-babe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/bleedhart-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>What had she done? Minako ran toward her house, cursing herself for her 
stupidity. What now? She couldn&#39;t go home after what she did, not now at 
least, while Artemis was watching like a hawk. How could she ever face 
Usagi again? Maybe she should just pretend that it didn&#39;t happen. Yea, 
like that would work. She left an energy heart in Usagi&#39;s palm!

&quot;Damn it, Minako, you idiot!&quot; She cursed herself, hiding in the bushes 
near her window. All she had to do was jump through the window to her 
room, grab her transformation pen and diary, and leave. Of course, doing 
that while Artemis was watching was no easy task.

Minako crept through the shadows, climbing the tree closest to her 
window. She crawled out on the limb, peering into the deep shadows of 
her room. Artemis was lying on her bed, right next to her diary and 
transformation pen on her nightstand and watching the door. Just great. 
Now what?

Minako bit her lip, then closed her eyes and focused on her palm. Her 
palm grew hot and another energy heart appeared in it. This one, though, 
was explosive. She threw it as hard as she could into the street and 
watched Artemis take off from the room. With a satisfied nod, Minako 
jumped through her window and sprang to her dresser. Quickly, she 
grabbed her ribbon and tied her hair up. One had to keep up appearances, 
even when running from all that had been your life.

Her eyes scanned the room, and fell on the picture of herself and Usagi 
when they had gotten their exams returned, saying that they had passed. 
Usagi&#39;s face was alive with laugher as she threw her arms around a 
laughing Minako&#39;s neck, their tests in their palms. Minako smiled and 
took the picture out of its frame, folding it and sticking it in her 
pocket. With a final sigh, she grabbed her diary and stuffed her pen in 
her pocket.

Without looking back, she jumped out the window and ran from the house, 
not knowing where she was going or when she would return.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{~~@

Birds cheerfully chirped outside Usagi&#39;s bedroom window as the sun 
peeked its flaming head up in the sky. The sight would have been 
beautiful, if Usagi had not been so exhausted and confused. She had not 
slept a wink since her encounter with Minako, and had done nothing but 
think about what the senshi had said, the way she had acted, the 
crumbling heart she had given her, and of her own strange reactions to 
the goddess.

Never before in her life had she wanted to hold a girl before, to just 
hold her close and touch her, comfort her. The only one she had ever 
wanted to hold like that was Mamoru, and making this comparison, Usagi 
became increasingly more disturbed. She wasn&#39;t sure weather she liked 
these new feelings or not.

And yet it had felt so natural, so warmly intimate, when Minako&#39;s hands 
had rubbed her arms. When she had held Usagi&#39;s hand to her breast, 
Usagi&#39;s heart had skipped a beat. But no! She couldn&#39;t be thinking these 
things about Sailor Venus, her closest, dearest friend. Of course not, 
she had Mamoru to love and cherish.

But Minako&#39;s eyes, their azure depths so sad and intense as she trained 
them on the princess and whispered her poem, flashed in Usagi&#39;s mind. 
She closed her eyes and remembered the floral scent of the goddess hair, 
the way her hands felt so gentle and soft as they caressed her flesh and 
held her fist. She shivered, wrapping her arms around herself and 
opening her eyes to stare at the picture of all the senshi on her 
dresser, faintly smiling as she saw Minako&#39;s beaming smile.

Usagi was shaken from her thoughts when she heard a cat&#39;s frantic mewing 
and scratching at her window. She sprang to the glass, confusion and, 
shamefully, anticipation lighting her eyes as she opened it for Artemis. 
He sprang into the room and looked around the room, worry on his feline 
face.

&quot;Usagi, is she here?!&quot; He asked, turning his frantic eyes on the 
confused princess.

&quot;Who? Luna&#39;s downstairs eating breakfast.&quot; She said, frowning at the 
cat. Artemis scowled, restlessly prowling the bed.

&quot;No, not Luna! Minako! Is Minako with you?&quot; Dread swelled in the pit of 
Usagi&#39;s stomach. Minako was missing? Oh god, no! This couldn&#39;t be 
happening! Not now, of all times for the golden senshi to come up 
missing!

&quot;No...she&#39;s not. Have you tried the other senshi&#39;s houses?&quot; Usagi&#39;s 
voice was hopeful, her hand already reaching for the phone. Artemis 
kneaded the bed with his claws in worry.

&quot;Yes, I did. None of the inner or outer senshi has seen her and neither 
has Mamoru. She left last night, for a walk she said. While I was 
waiting for her I heard something explode near the house and left the 
room. There was nothing there but a heart-shaped crater in the sidewalk 
and when I got back into the room her transformation pen, a picture that 
was near her bed, and her diary were gone.&quot;

Usagi&#39;s heart seemed to stop. She ran away? But why would she do that? 
Maybe...but no! Why would she run away because of what happened the 
night before? Usagi had prompted her to speak of her heart, had pushed 
Venus into revealing her deepest secrets. Had not only urged her to 
recite the poem, but secretly cherished it. Surely Minako was not afraid 
of her reaction?

&quot;You mean Minako ran away?&quot; Usagi sank to the bed, staring at the 
picture of Minako at the modeling contest the year before, at the 
triumphant gleam in the senshi&#39;s eyes and the aurora of beauty around 
her. &quot;But...this can&#39;t be! I-I need her! She can&#39;t leave, she just 
can&#39;t!&quot; Tears welled up in Usagi&#39;s eyes, her shoulders shaking as she 
clasped her hands in her lap in a vain attempt to stop their shaking.

Artemis walked over to Usagi and rubbed his head against her hand, 
purring. &quot;I know, Usagi. I can&#39;t think of a reason why she would run 
away, but it looks as if she has. I don&#39;t know where she could have 
gone, but I&#39;ve called for a senshi meeting tonight at five. Did you see 
her at all last night?&quot;

Usagi looked away, guiltily. Should she tell him what happened? She 
really should, the senshi had a right to know why Mina would have ran 
away...but no. Their encounter last night was a personal thing, 
something that she didn&#39;t want to share with anyone just yet. Not even 
Artemis. &quot;No,&quot; she whispered, not meeting his eyes. &quot;I was asleep.&quot; She 
could feel Artemis stare at her, not believing her. But if he saw the 
lie, he didn&#39;t comment on it.

&quot;Well,&quot; he finally said, &quot;I&#39;m going to tell Luna and see if we can find 
any clue to where she might have gone before the meeting. If you hear 
from her, contact us.&quot; And he slipped out the door, slinking down the 
stairs.

Usagi had seen Minako last night. Not only could he see the lie for what 
it was, he also saw the bags under her eyes and the way she had been 
staring at Minako&#39;s picture before she let him in. He didn&#39;t know what 
happened between them, but if Usagi had chosen to lie to him about it 
then he guessed that it was something big, and the reason for Minako&#39;s 
sudden flight.

He also had a hunch what it could have been centered around. He knew 
that Minako&#39;s feelings would get the better of her at one point or 
another. He just hoped that whatever confession his charge had made was 
not going to affect the future of Crystal Tokyo.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{~~@

Sailor Venus walked the sandy slopes of the land of Aphrodite, her 
Venusian body unaffected by the sulfuric atmosphere and storms of Venus. 
She didn&#39;t come here often, but it was the only safe haven she could 
think of. She wouldn&#39;t stay long, but she felt that she needed strength.

She squinted her azure eyes, peering through the storm to find her 
bearings. A smile slowly lit her face as she saw her goal just ahead, 
Aphrodite&#39;s Temple of Prayer, where the royal family came to pray to the 
Great Goddess. This place was her last hope. If ever she wanted to be 
rid of her love for the Moon Princess, only the Goddess of Love could 
help her.

Minako sighed and shook the sand from her hair as she entered the 
temple. The temple was built of white marble and gold trim that curved 
and wound in elegant shapes and textures throughout the temple, built by 
Venusian architects millenniums ago to withstand anything. Although the 
gold was tarnished and the stone was cracked and scratched, the temple 
stood strong and proud, an elegant testimony to the people of Venus. 
There was only one object inside: a statue of Aphrodite carved of pure 
Topaz. The goddess smiled down upon Minako as she kneeled at her feet.

Minako squeezed her eyes shut tightly, laying her hands on the Goddess&#39;s 
stone feet. A golden-orange light enveloped her body, caressing her 
flesh like the hands of a lover as it replaced her senshi uniform with 
the elegant robes and tiara she had worn all those years ago, when she 
had been Princess Minako of the planet Venus. Those peaceful days were 
long gone, lost in the rubble of the past. Yet the memories of her 
planet, alive and teaming with life and love, filled her memory, brought 
more tears to her eyes.

&quot;What have we done to this planet, oh Great Aphrodite? Our once thriving 
society of love and pleasure, reduced to this...desert. These ruins of 
what once had been the place where my heart resided. It was my 
planet...I did not need love then. I had my people, my planet, and my 
duties as a Sailor Senshi. I was not plagued by this love that 
overwhelms my heart now.

&quot;I love her, Aphrodite! I always have. I&#39;ve known her for so long, so 
many lifetimes. Did I love her in each of them? Or am I just cursed with 
hopeless, impossible lovers? First Kunzite, then Adonis, then Alan and 
Yaten...and now her. She is the Princess of the Moon Kingdom, the 
silvery goddess who lived on the glowing planet. The heart and soul of 
that magical land. But she is so much more than just beautiful, just 
powerful. She is filled with kindness and generosity, she sees me like 
no other has ever bothered, she&#39;s ditsy and lazy and a cry baby...but 
she&#39;s innocent.&quot;

Minako opened her eyes, gazing up and the loving face of her goddess. 
&quot;Please! I don&#39;t want to love Usagi any longer! She loves Mamoru and 
they are destined to be together for all time! Where is there room in 
her heart for me? I cannot fit into their perfect picture in any other 
role than that which I am currently in. And seeing her with him tears me 
apart. Usagi...just hearing her name is like digging a knife into my 
heart. I used to mask it, this terrible longing, my hidden fantasies, 
who I really am, but I cannot hide it any longer!&quot;

Minako hung her head, a tear falling from her eyes and onto the 
Goddess&#39;s toe. &quot;I love her more than anything else, Aphrodite, and I 
cannot. For her, for the future, for my destiny, I cannot love her any 
longer. Please, take it away. Destroy this forbidden passion; rip my 
heart from my breast and destroy the half that belongs to her so that I 
may live as destiny commands of me, with but half a heart so that I may 
never love again. Please...it hurts so much...please help me.&quot;

Minako&#39;s shoulders s she cried, her body draped over the statue&#39;s feet, 
pleas falling from her lips. A warm pair of arms slid around her 
shoulders and Minako sobbed, knowing exactly who had come. She threw 
herself into the arms of Aphrodite, bitterly weeping into the soft robes 
of the glowing goddess.

Aphrodite held her close and stroked the girl&#39;s hair, her smile knowing 
and happy. &quot;My child,&quot; she whispered, her voice like sex in the air, 
&quot;dry thy tears. I know of thy strife and of thy love, for it is I who 
granted thee love when it was bidden of me.&quot; Minako wiped the tears off 
her cheeks and turned her gaze up to the face of her goddess, a face so 
akin to her own. &quot;Yes, thy destiny is cruel to thee, my child.&quot; 
Aphrodite continued. &quot;Many hath thee loved and many hath the killed, 
despite thy love.&quot;

Minako frowned, struggling to understand what the Goddess was leading 
to. These things she knew, and was ashamed of. She had loved, deeply and 
truly, and then en she loved. But she stayed silent, awaiting her 
Goddess&#39;s words and clinging to her warm comfort. &quot;Thrice over hath thee 
killed thy lover, and twice hath thee given thy lover away to another. 
Pondered I, why? For thy heart was true and thy love was deep. So I hath 
watched thee, and guided thee, and endowed thee with my power. But thy 
hath not used my power for thy own love.&quot;

The Goddess touched Mina&#39;s cheek with her hand, smiling as she spoke. 
&quot;And so I saw thy Princess. I saw thy affection for her, thy loyalty to 
her; thy willingness to die for her, kill thy true loves for her ten 
fold if she bid thee. It had not been for love then, but for deep 
affection, respect, and friendship. And so I saw that it was good, and 
that thy love for her would be long and deep and everlasting.

&quot;Because I love thee, because my child thee are, I broke two most 
important rules. I broke the chain of true love between the Moon 
Princess and her Earth Prince, tying him to another whom he is yet to 
meet and created a bond between thy heart and the heart of thy princess 
that will last longer than that between any man and woman. For thee, I 
hath made a forbidden match and faced the wrath of the gods, but they, 
too, saw that it was good and blessed thy love.

&quot;Thy princess is confused, for thy poem of truest love and truest pain 
has stirred her love. She dreams of thee even now as the sun rises over 
the earth. She longs for thee.&quot; Oh sweet gods above...had Aphrodite just 
said what she thought she said?! But how could that be, breaking a bond 
that had spanned time and death and space and lifetimes to give her an 
angel to love and hold close?

Words would not seem to form on her lips, so Minako threw her arms 
around Aphrodite&#39;s neck and kissed her perfect cheek. &quot;Thank you, 
mother!&quot; she managed to whisper as the Goddess held her close.

&quot;Gratitude is not needed, for thee hath defended my honor many times and 
hath used my gift of power wisely and unselfishly. To ease thy suffering 
is my gift to thee. Now go to her, my child. Go to her and be gentle, be 
patient, for she still loves her prince. Wise would it be to not reveal 
our encounter until thy wedding night.&quot;

Minako&#39;s eyes widened and her jaw dropped. &quot;W-wedding?! I-uh-um...holy 
crap! You think far ahead, don&#39;t you?&quot; Aphrodite laughed, hugging her 
child once more.

&quot;Ah, darling Minako, thy hath much to learn. I love thee my child. 
Return to this place and visit me again, for I hath missed thee sorely.&quot; 
And the Goddess faded away, the warmth of her embrace and the smell of 
gardens on her skin lingering around Minako for a moment. Truly smiling 
for the first time in many months, Minako turned from the temple and 
ran.

Ran to the arms she knew were awaiting her return.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{~~@

The silence in the temple was tangible. The senshi sat in their meeting 
room in Rei&#39;s temple, staring at one another in confused silence. They 
had discussed every possibility as to why Minako left, including a new 
enemy that kidnapped her, an unexpected trip. Maybe she was going back 
to England to talk with the model agency there? But one by one, each 
hypothesis came to one answer: no, their friend would have told them, 
would have contacted them, would not have left in the middle of the 
night with what she had left with.

Usagi stayed silent, gritting her teeth and focusing on the carpet in 
front of her. She knew why Minako left, and guilt ate at her. She really 
should tell them, but her heart ached for Minako. She couldn&#39;t look 
Mamoru in the eye, because when she did she thought of the tears that 
had swam in the golden senshi&#39;s eyes the night before. When he held her 
close to him, Usagi&#39;s heart ached and she longed for Minako&#39;s arms 
around her, not her boyfriend&#39;s.

Mamoru could sense that Usagi knew more than she was saying, that 
something was eating at his lover&#39;s conscience. But he decided not to 
comment on it, not in front of the senshi. He wanted to hold her, to 
comfort her, but she pushed him away. Why would she push him away unless 
something so big, so dramatic happened the night before that the blond 
didn&#39;t want his touch?

Artemis caught his eye from across the room. There was a look in the 
feline&#39;s eyes, a knowing look. Mamoru nodded, slightly, as the cat 
glanced at Usagi and back at him. Maybe the guardian knew what was going 
on. Maybe someone could explain to him why Usagi pushed him away.

&quot;Well, it seems that there is nothing more to say.&quot; Ami jotted down a 
few last notes on her notepad and turned her quiet eyes on the group as 
she spoke. &quot;If anyone hears from Minako or finds a clue as to the reason 
for her disappearance or her whereabouts, then they can contact one of 
us on our communicators. Goodnight everyone.&quot;

Usagi waited until everyone began talking until she made her quiet exit. 
There was no reason to stay that night, as she normally would have done. 
Staying and participating in mindless chatter would do nothing to help 
her find Minako. And she had to find her, had to ask her why. Why did 
she leave? What was the poem about? Why did looking at her make Usagi&#39;s 
heart skip a beat?

She thought she knew the answers, but no. That could not possibly be the 
true reason. Please, God, don&#39;t let her suspicions be true! But what 
other explanation was there for it all? Had the Princess of the Moon 
Kingdom fallen in love with her Senshi guard and closest friend with one 
simple encounter? Because of a single poem, a tender touch, a few tears. 
Discarded a love that had lasted countless lifetimes for one that could 
never possibly be returned.

&quot;Usa!&quot; Usagi snapped from her reverie, cringing at the voice. She 
stopped and turned around, pasting a smile on her face as Mamoru ran 
toward her. He slowed as he reached her, smiling his handsome smile as 
his dark black hair brushed his forehead. He was so handsome, so loving 
and sweet, so perfect for her. Why, then, did his smile fail to strike 
love in her heart?

&quot;Hey Usa, why&#39;d you leave? That&#39;s not like you.&quot; He draped an arm over 
her shoulders, a gesture that would have been comfortable, would have 
made Usagi turn into him and hold him close. But she couldn&#39;t bring 
herself to hold him close, couldn&#39;t bring her heart to pound with love. 
All she could think of, all she could long for, was Minako. But why?

&quot;I&#39;m very worried about Minako.&quot; She admitted, forcing herself to wrap 
her arm around his waist. &quot;I want to find her, to find out why she ran 
away from us. But how can we do that if we&#39;re all standing around 
talking, ya know what I mean?&quot; She looked up at Mamoru and saw his eyes 
darken and the smile that curled his lips was obviously forced.

&quot;Yes, I understand. I hope we can find her.&quot; His arm fell from her 
shoulders and he stuffed his hands in his pockets. Usagi clasped her 
hands, staring at the ground as an uncomfortable silence fell between 
them. He knew. She didn&#39;t know how, but he knew something.

&quot;Mamo...&quot;

&quot;Hey, Usagi, I&#39;ve got to run over to the lab quickly. I&#39;m sorry, but 
I&#39;ve got to go.&quot; Without waiting for a reply from her, he turned and 
strode away in a direction that she knew for a fact was the opposite of 
his college laboratory building. She stood frozen, as if he had slapped 
her. Oh god...what now?

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Mamo...I&#39;m sorry!&quot; Her feet seemed to move on their own, 
taking off running as she covered her face with her hands. Ran for her 
soul, for her life, from the confusion and guilt in her heart. Sobs tore 
through her body, and she pleaded for forgiveness from people that would 
never hear her cries. &quot;I love you! Forgive me!&quot;</pre>
