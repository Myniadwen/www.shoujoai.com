<h1>Someday, Hold Me Close to You (part 10 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/venusreiko.html">Venus Reiko</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/someday-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>&quot;There is no head priest here anymore. I am the owner of this shrine. 
What is this emergency?&quot;

The truth was, she didn&#39;t care. Usually she was very kind to all sorts 
of strangers, but this man overstepped a boundary, and they&#39;d only just 
met. She wanted him gone, and fast.

&quot;I used to be an apprentice for the head priest many years ago when I 
was a kid. My parents wanted me to be a priest and work at my 
grandfather&#39;s temple when I became old enough, but I didn&#39;t want to, so 
I left. I did leave my parents, but not this shrine.&quot; He looked it over, 
a fond smile on his face.

Now that Rei examined the man more closer, he did look like the 
rebellious type. His hair was longer than normal men his age-which would 
be around 27-28?- he had some stubble, and his shirt had some type of 
American band logo on it. His baggy blue jeans were ripped in different 
places, and that was a fashion statement that baffled Rei&#151;she didn&#39;t get 
it. His &#39;rebellious&#39; look was finished off with a guitar placed gently 
against the wall. She sure as heck didn&#39;t play the guitar, so she knew 
it had to be his.

Though she didn&#39;t quite understand his fashion sense, she knew that if 
she was really into men, he&#39;d be the type of guy she&#39;d go for. She 
rolled her eyes. She realized she was one of those girls who had 
&#39;things&#39; for musicians.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but the priest never mentioned a Kamada Yuuichiro to me.&quot;

Rei squinted her eyes skeptically at the man standing before her. She&#39;d 
been at the shrine for many, many years, yet she did not remember 
Yuuichiro. If she was correct, he would have been around ten or eleven 
when she arrived. He surely couldn&#39;t have left the shrine and lived on 
his own at such a young age. He had to be lying...

Rei crossed her arms and slowly paced around him.

&quot;I&#39;ve lived here since I was four, Kamada-san, and I don&#39;t seem to 
recall ever meeting you. And out of curiosity, how old are you?&quot;

Yuuichiro stood his ground. He knew what she was doing.

&quot;I&#39;m twenty-eight.&quot; Rei clicked her teeth together and nodded.

&quot;Ah. I see. So you left the shrine and lived on your own when you were 
ten then? But that can&#39;t be possible. Go on, tell me why you&#39;re really 
here.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be honest with you. I have no where else to go, and your 
grandfather, Hino-sama promised me that if I ever needed a place to 
stay, I could always return here. And for the record, I remember you, 
Hino Rei.&quot; He flashed a toothy white smile, and Rei&#39;s eyes went big.

&quot;W-what? How do you-&quot;

&quot;Your father left you here when you were four after your mother died. I 
remember you telling me he was just dropping you off here for a visit 
and that he&#39;d been back soon, but he never came back. You didn&#39;t sleep 
for weeks...you just waited at the door until you realized that he 
wasn&#39;t coming back.&quot;

Rei clenched her teeth together. She didn&#39;t remember doing that, but she 
knew it was true, because her grandfather had told her a similar story 
when she was fourteen. She was upset with herself after he&#39;d told her 
that. She didn&#39;t like remembering when she was so...weak.

&quot;If the head priest owed you a debt or promised you something, I 
apologize. I can&#39;t do anything about it.&quot;

Yuuichiro raised his eyebrows and opened his mouth to speak.

&quot;But-&quot;

&quot;Taka, Yumi, Kaori; Please escort this gentlemen out. I will have no 
further disturbances in my shrine.&quot;

The three girls hesitated, looking back and forth at Rei, then 
Yuuichiro. Rei glowered at them. They instantly panicked, worried that 
Rei would call their parents and explain to them how they not only let a 
stranger into a sacred room, but flirted with the stranger...who was 
twenty-eight.

As they carefully started to push him towards the door, he easily 
escaped and put himself right in front of Rei, bluntly violating her 
personal space. She attempted to muster up the best glare that she 
could, but the height disadvantage she had was daunting. It was almost 
humorous how the two looked. She knew if Minako were to see this- Mars 
Reiko glaring up at a man twice her size, while he smirked at her- she&#39;d 
roll on the floor with laughter.

&quot;Hino-san,&quot; he said softly. &quot;Onegai. Please honor your grandfather&#39;s 
promise to me. I&#39;ll clean, I&#39;ll wash clothes, I&#39;ll sell charms, I&#39;ll do 
anything. Just please, until I can get back onto my feet... Let me stay 
here. I&#39;ll stay out of your way and your business, I promise.&quot;

Rei could smell the scent of whatever soap he used on himself radiating 
off of him. Well, at least he had good hygiene. IF she let him stay 
there-which she wasn&#39;t going to allow- she was assured she wouldn&#39;t be 
rooming with a dirtball.

She continued glaring up at him, only to find herself melting at his 
cute boyish face and his confident smirk. Her glare began to waver. She 
turned away from him.

&quot;Your words are not enough to convince me of this &#39;promise&#39;. I need 
material proof.&quot;

Yuuichiro grinned and reached into his back pocket and pulled out a 
thin, crumpled rectangular-shaped object. He held the thin object over 
Rei&#39;s shoulder so she could get a good look at it. She grabbed it, 
scolding herself for forgetting her glasses back at Minako&#39;s hotel. She 
placed it closely in front of her eyes and finally realized it was a 
picture. And lo and behold, there was her grandfather, a small boy who 
she presumed to be little Yuuichiro, and a little girl who was much 
smaller than the boy. It was...Rei. She turned the photo over and saw 
the word &#39;Home&#39; written on the back. The kanji style used looked very 
much like the type her grandfather used while he was alive, and it was 
very distinct.

When she was quiet for at least a whole minute, Yuuichiro grew concerned 
he&#39;d struck a wrong cord with the priestess.

&quot;Hino-san? Do you believe me now?&quot;

Rei didn&#39;t bother to turn around when she shoved the picture into 
Yuuichiro&#39;s stomach. He was caught off guard, but took it from her hand. 
The three high school students who&#39;d been watching with keen interest 
looked back and forth at one another. They&#39;d never seen something get to 
their priestess that bad before.

&quot;You can stay here.&quot; The girls squealed out of glee, catching an angry 
stare from Rei. &quot;But you have to uphold your promise to stay out of my 
affairs, and that you will leave within two months. Not only that, but I 
don&#39;t want you hanging around these girls. They&#39;re too young for you.&quot;

Yuuichiro looked over his shoulder and winked at the girls, but then 
turned to face Rei-who was now looking at him- with a stern look across 
his strong features.

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am!&quot;

&quot;And,&quot; she went on with a scowl. &quot;Seeing as you used to be an apprentice 
for my grandfather, you will resume your duty to this shrine and do 
daily chores. I will not accept any excuses, and believe me... I won&#39;t 
hesitate to kick you out without a second thought. Also, you&#39;re not to 
come into this room ever again. Now all of you, get out.&quot;

The three girls bowed and rushed out of the fire room, whispering almost 
inaudibly to each other. Yuuichiro bowed his head slightly, grabbed his 
guitar, and took one last look at Rei before walking out.

Rei stood there like a statue, her arms crossed and her scowl plastered 
on.

&quot;Have I made a mistake, Grandpa?&quot; she inquired into the air. No answer.

&quot;Usually I&#39;m not swayed so easily, especially by strangers, but... That 
picture... He has to be telling the truth. How could he have gotten that 
if he is lying?&quot; She sighed and let her arms fall to her side before 
lowering her head.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mars and Venus stood next to each other as they scanned the ballroom 
area for any suspicious person or persons. Venus nudged her dark-haired 
comrade.

&quot;I apologize for teasing you so much these past couple of weeks.&quot; Mars 
scoffed.

&quot;I don&#39;t. You deserved every word I said to you. I suppose people don&#39;t 
teach manners on Venus, hmm?&quot; The blonde crossed her arms and turned her 
head away from Mars.

&quot;Fine, then. I take back my apology. I didn&#39;t mean it anyway.&quot; The 
Princess of Mars sighed and went on with her senshi duties. Not much was 
happening at the ball. She almost wanted someone strange to walk in so 
she could have at least a little fun and beat her frustrations out on 
the poor moron. She smiled at the word moron. Minako practically defined 
the word.

Although she was sure she hated the Venusian, she couldn&#39;t help but feel 
thankful to the gods the girl was there. At least she allowed Rei to 
settle in a little quicker at a place she had no desire to be.

&quot;Hey,&quot; Venus nudged to girl again with her elbow. Mars rolled her eyes, 
becoming irritated at how the girl always found some way to touch her.

&quot;What?&quot; she asked, not even bothering to hide how annoyed she was.

&quot;That Prince Endymion and his generals are kind of cute, eh? Maybe if 
I&#39;m lucky, one of them will come over here and ask me to dance so I can 
get away from you.&quot; Venus smirked, placing a hand at her side and the 
other on her hip. Mars half-laughed.

&quot;Maybe if you&#39;re lucky? Maybe if I&#39;m lucky.&quot;

&quot;Do you even know how to dance, Mars?&quot;

&quot;No, not really.&quot;

Venus knew she had a chance to openly mock the dark-haired soldier, 
maybe saying something like, &#39;Oh, I can tell. Your combat skills are a 
clear indication that you can&#39;t. You move around like a big gorilla.&#39; 
Really, Minako had no idea how gorillas moved. She&#39;d only heard about 
them through people who traveled to Earth from Venus. But with a name 
like &#39;gorilla&#39;, one could assume, eh? Or maybe she could break out into 
a fit of laughter, draw attention to the girls, and completely embarrass 
Rei. When one of the dancers would ask what was so funny, she&#39;d say, 
&quot;Oh, nothing. It&#39;s just that the princess of Mars dances like a bear.&quot; 
Again, Minako knew nothing about the creatures called &#39;bears&#39;.

But something made her take pity on the girl. Surely on Mars barely 
anyone knew how to dance. It was a planet based mostly on war and 
death... Who would have time for dancing? Venus, on the hand, was 
completely different. Dancing was a well-treasured tradition on the 
orange planet, and just about everyone knew how to. Minako smirked 
proudly inside. She was one of the best, second only to her mother. 
That&#39;s when one of her oh-so-brilliant ideas popped into her mind.

&quot;How about I teach you?&quot;

No one spoke for a few moments after that until Mars chuckled.

&quot;No, thanks. It doesn&#39;t look too hard anyhow. All you have to do is move 
your feet back and forth, forward, backwards. If anyone asked me to 
dance, I could manage.&quot; Minako let out a mock gasp and then smirked.

&quot;There&#39;s more to it than that.&quot; She began circling around the girl, 
looking her over in a way that made Mars uncomfortable. Then again, if 
you just glanced at Mars she grew uncomfortable.

&quot;You have to know where to put your hands, and where not to put your 
hands.&quot; She stopped her slow pacing right in front of her comrade, who 
was already making things awkward. Venus ignored it though, and 
continued on with her quest. If there was one thing she was good at, it 
was dealing with any type of person, whether they be the biggest priss 
in the world or the most insecure person in the world. Rei, strangely, 
seemed to be a good mix of both.

&quot;Pretend I&#39;m a man. Or a woman, if that&#39;s what you prefer.&quot; Venus 
covered her mouth as she laughed mostly just for show, drawing an 
irritated sigh from the Martian in front of her.

&quot;Ha ha, you&#39;re hilarious. Get on with it. I&#39;m pretending you&#39;re a-&quot; 
Venus raised her eyebrows. A light blush that was thankfully almost 
unnoticeable covered Mars&#39; face.

&quot;Oh, who cares? What would you like me to do?&quot;

&quot;Put your arms around me like we&#39;re about to dance. Let&#39;s see if you&#39;re 
really paying attention to the patrons on the dance floor. No time to be 
shy!&quot;

Mars gulped nervously and gaped at the blonde standing dangerously close 
to her. Was she serious?

That&#39;s when Venus leaned in and whispered into Mars&#39; ear, &quot;No one&#39;s 
watching. Don&#39;t worry about anyone seeing.&quot; As soon as Venus&#39; breath hit 
her ear, Mars felt a chill go down her spine. She may have had deep 
seeds of hatred for this girl planted inside of her, but she wasn&#39;t 
blind. The title of the goddess of beauty fit her perfectly. This 
realization smacked her in the face many a time, and as usual, she grew 
even more self-conscious.

Mars nodded in response. She put the side of her balled up fist to her 
mouth and cleared her throat before nodding once more for 
self-assurance. She stole once last sly glance towards the dance floor, 
spotting a man holding his dancing partner (who was a woman) around her 
waist. So with that, the princess of Mars hesitantly placed her gloved 
hands on Venus&#39; waist. The Venusian princess was caught off guard; she 
was sure Rei would have went for the hands-around-the-neck option, but 
she thought wrong.

&quot;I guess someone would have to do it, anyway. Okay, good. It makes it 
easier for me to lead since I&#39;m so accustomed to the formal position 
used between a man and a woman.&quot;

She looked at Mars with a raised eyebrow while the girl kept her eyes 
focused to the marble floor. She wondered why Mars insisted on standing 
so far away. They would never be able to dance with this much distance 
between them. Venus slipped her hands through Mars&#39; long, silky dark 
hair and allowed them to rest on her shoulders, her gloved fingers 
playing over the back of Mars&#39; neck. She moved herself considerably 
closer, and she saw her comrade take a deep breath. Although Mars would 
not keep eye contact with her, Venus kept her eyes focused on her 
partner&#39;s face. Her skin was so pale, so flawless&#151;it was almost unreal, 
as if she were a doll packaged from the Moon. Her lips were full and a 
deep shade of pink, their color much like Minako&#39;s own. She smelled like 
the best flowers from Venus put together (usually one would think the 
combination of so many flowers would result in foul stench, but 
apparently that wasn&#39;t true). Why she smelled like flowers from Venus, 
one would never know. In any case, it made the princess of Venus more 
comfortable even if the hands around her waist were stiff and almost 
robotic.

&quot;You&#39;re very pretty, you know.&quot; Red rapidly covered Mars&#39; face, matching 
the red bow on her Sailor fuku. Venus smiled and ran her hands from 
Mars&#39; neck, over her shoulders, down her arms and then finally her 
hands. She took them into her own, causing Mars to stir and look at 
Venus, wide-eyed.

&quot;We&#39;re going to try the dance they&#39;re doing,&quot; Venus announced and 
gestured over to the dancers on the white shining floor. &quot;okay?&quot;

Mars grew nervous and she looked from the dancers to Venus, to the 
dancers, then back to Venus. She couldn&#39;t do what they were doing in 
such a short amount of time! She was certain with extra time, AT another 
time, she&#39;d be able to master the waltz perfectly-on her OWN, of course- 
but right now, at such short notice... No, it wasn&#39;t going to happen.

&quot;Are you serious? That&#39;s great that you&#39;re a dancer-extraordinaire and 
all, but as I admitted to you earlier, I am not. Please, even though 
this would be a perfect time to embarrass me in front of all of the 
Queen&#39;s patrons, I beseech you: don&#39;t force me to do this. I don&#39;t want 
to learn, and I especially don&#39;t want you teaching me. You&#39;re annoying.&quot; 
Venus smiled slyly.

&quot;You&#39;re the one still holding my hands. I let go a few moments ago.&quot;

Mars glanced down at the limp hands in hers and dropped them, whispering 
Martian curses to herself.

&quot;My original intent was to embarrass you, I admit, but now I want to 
help the both of us out. If a man comes over to us and asks you to dance 
but you decline due to inexperience, we&#39;ll be stuck together for far 
longer than any of us would like. I would truly like to help you.&quot; She 
let out a proud sigh. &quot;I am, after all, the leader, and it is my duty to 
make sure that my senshi are well-taken care of.&quot;

Venus was lying partially. She really did want to teach the raven-haired 
princess to dance, and not for the sake of humiliation, but rather for 
the sake of saving Mars from embarrassment when she-against her will- 
would be eventually dragged out onto the dance floor. She knew how pushy 
royalty could be, and while she knew she&#39;d enjoy Mars&#39; mortification to 
an extent, her conscience wouldn&#39;t let her stand by and allow it to 
happen.

Meanwhile, Mercury and Jupiter glanced at each other then to their two 
comrades located on the other side of Queen Serenity&#39;s large throne. 
Jupiter was on guard, and not only for unsuspecting peoples entering the 
castle, but for the princesses of Mars and Venus as well. She&#39;d 
separated them more times than she could count on her two hands from 
pummeling each other.

Mercury, on the other hand, smiled to herself as she watched the two. 
Though they&#39;d bickered plenty of other times, she could tell it was 
becoming a sort of comfortable bickering, and not really for low-blows 
anymore. It seemed to make Rei and Minako relax into their new 
lifestyles easier.

She scanned the castle once more with her dark-blue eyes for anything 
out of the ordinary, then turned her attention back to her fellow 
princesses. Venus was laughing now as she gently shoved the scowling, 
blushing Mars with her hand. Soon after, the two went back to their 
respective posts next to each other at Venus&#39; insistence. However, 
Mercury watched as Rei stole a quick glance at the Senshi of Love, and 
then ever-so-slowly, smiled.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Minako smiled before her eyes followed suit with the rest of her 
awakening body and opened. She sat up, allowing her socked feet to rest 
on the floor, sending Artemis onto it as well.

&quot;Ahhh! Man, Minako... Can&#39;t you ever warn me before you decided to make 
a show out of stretching?&quot;

With her arms thrust out into the air as she stretched and let out a 
yawn, she peered down at her guardian. She lazily grinned.

&quot;Sorry.&quot; She picked Artemis up and sat him in her lap. &quot;I love good 
dream-memories. Not only do they put me in a great mood, but they 
inspire me as well. I&#39;ve already got the first few lines to a new song 
memorized in my head.&quot;

&quot;Let me guess, it was about Mars?&quot; The white plushy cuddled closely to 
Minako as she stroked his head. The far-away look in her light brown 
eyes and her smile said it all. &quot;Of course.&quot;

Suddenly remembering Rei slept over the night before, Minako hastily 
stood up, her jaw practically resting on the floor. Artemis crashed back 
onto the carpet and hissed up at his former-charge. Although he was a 
plushy, he was still entitled to pain.

&quot;She&#39;s gone, Minako. She left early this morning around 7 A.M. I didn&#39;t 
speak with her, but I saw her writing a note. It&#39;s over there on the 
desk.&quot;

Minako let out a sharp breath. She was relieved Rei hadn&#39;t heard about 
the good dream-memory, but disappointed that the girl had left without 
even really saying good-bye. She thought after last night they&#39;d 
established somewhat of a better friendship. Then again, she thought, it 
was very much like Rei to make you feel like you&#39;d gained a connection, 
then leave you &#39;high-and-dry&#39;, if you will. But no, she wouldn&#39;t let Rei 
get away with leaving suddenly that easy. She&#39;d get her back somehow...

Minako made her way to the desk, strolling over casually as if the note 
didn&#39;t really matter to her. Artemis rolled his eyes.

&quot;She&#39;s just trying to fool herself, as usual.&quot;

The idol picked up the note and opened it slowly, chewing on her bottom 
lip out of habit.

Minako,

Shrine duties start at 7:30 and the high school volunteers should be 
there by now. Sorry to leave without a proper good-bye, but I figured 
you&#39;d understand. If you&#39;re not busy and you get bored, feel free to 
call me sometime in the late morning or early afternoon.

Rei

P.S.- Thanks.

Minako smiled to herself. Why bother calling? She liked surprising (more 
like irritating) Rei.

As she headed for the bathroom, she softly sung the newly-inspired 
lyrics to herself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Usagi forcefully threw her hands onto the counter of the flower shop, 
startling Makoto and causing Motoki to let out a high-pitched scream. 
Both Usagi and his wife eyed him strangely. He grinned nervously and 
waved his hand in front of his face.

&quot;Heh, heh... I&#39;ll leave you two ladies alone.&quot; Makoto nodded and smiled.

Usagi watched as Motoki scurried off, his head lowered to the vase of 
flowers he was holding.

&quot;So how come you decided to storm our shop earlier than usual today, 
Usagi?&quot; Makoto asked.

&quot;Besides the fact I was bored because Mamo-chan took Chibi-Usa out early 
this morning while I was still asleep-the meanie!- I came up with a 
plan.&quot; Makoto waited a few seconds for her odango-haired friend to 
continue, but instead she stood there staring into big, dark brown orbs.

&quot;A plan for...?&quot; Usagi grinned widely and shook her head.

&quot;You know, Mako-chan!&quot;

Makoto raised an eyebrow.

&quot;Um... Actually, I don&#39;t. Care to fill me in?&quot; Usagi crossed her arms.

&quot;You know, the love-love situation regarding two of our best friends!&quot; 
Usagi sighed. &quot;One&#39;s head-over-heels in love and the other is as 
clueless as a bunny.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Love-love&#39;? I&#39;m betting that you&#39;re talking about Minako and Rei. 
Listen, Usagi,&quot; Makoto began firmly, &quot;I think we really should stay out 
of this-&quot;

&quot;No, we will NOT stay out of it, especially when young, innocent love is 
at stake!&quot;

Makoto poked at a few flowers and shook her head.

&quot;One&#39;s twenty-two and the other&#39;s twenty-three; grown women, Usagi. 
Plus... Innocent? Have you seen Minako&#39;s more recent spreads in Candy?&quot;

Usagi cocked her head to the side.

&quot;I guess not. Anyway,&quot; she leant in towards Usagi, who eagerly leant 
forward as well. Makoto lowered her voice to a whisper, a devious smirk 
crossing her lips. &quot;We don&#39;t know what happened between them last night. 
I called Mayumi late last night just to make sure Rei got home safely, 
but Mayumi told me that our little Rei never went home.&quot; Usagi&#39;s eyes 
bulged.

&quot;And you know as well as I do that she hates sleeping anywhere other 
than in her bed at the shrine, so she must have been reeaaallly cozy 
over at Minako&#39;s place if she never went home.&quot; Usagi giggled and 
playfully shoved the grinning Makoto.

&quot;You sneak! You DO care about them just as much as I do!&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;m not going to do anything about it. I know how much being 
pestered about romantic things can become annoying, fast.&quot; She 
mock-glared at Usagi, who cowered in fear. &quot;This is between the two of 
them. Not Tsukino Usagi and friends.&quot;

Usagi pouted and took Motoki&#39;s old seat next to the counter. She propped 
her elbows onto the counter and rested her chin in her palms. If she 
could get those two together, she&#39;d feel like she fulfilled some sort of 
life-goal that was only recently given to her. She hated how Rei didn&#39;t 
date and avoided romantic relationships altogether, because she was 
really missing out on something great. She wanted Rei to feel loved, but 
she knew it was hard for her priestess friend to open up to anyone, even 
in the slightest. She wasn&#39;t even sure if Rei ever even kissed someone 
before. Usagi smiled to herself.

&quot;Now that&#39;s something she&#39;s really missing out on.&quot;

While she was on the subject, she wondered if Minako had ever kissed 
somebody before. It was probable, especially since Usagi heard so many 
rumors about the idol&#39;s love-life through her &#39;tasteless, gossip 
magazines&#39; (as Mamoru had called them) and the &quot;Entertainment Nightly 
News&quot; show. But then again, Usagi knew rumors were just that&#151;rumors. 
Still...someone so beautiful, popular, and widely-known surely couldn&#39;t 
be that prude, right?

&quot;Minako-chan said that she and Rei-chan almost kissed yesterday. That 
would have been Rei-chan&#39;s first kiss. Aww! Rei-chan is too cute!&quot;

Makoto wrapped a small pink and red banner with the writing, &quot;Happy 
Anniversary&quot; written across it around the flowers she&#39;d been arranging. 
She stood back to examine her work. She nodded complacently and then 
reached under the counter for a large brown paper bag. That&#39;s when she 
noticed how quiet Usagi had become. It seemed that the girl was thinking 
very deeply, and that worried Makoto. Usagi thinking hard at all alone 
worried her.

&quot;Minako-chan really loves Rei-chan. She has for so many years... It&#39;s so 
tragic.&quot; Usagi sighed dramatically. &quot;Unrequited love.&quot;

Makoto half-laughed as she carefully placed the flowers into the bag.

&quot;I don&#39;t think this is a matter of unrequited love.&quot;

Usagi&#39;s ears perked up, her eyes once again growing twice their size 
with curiosity.

&quot;You don&#39;t? Do you know something that I don&#39;t, Mako-chan? Ooo, tell me! 
Tell Usagi!&quot;

Makoto finished with the bag and then sat down on the stool, facing 
Usagi. She looked hesitant.

&quot;I don&#39;t know exactly know how Rei feels, but it doesn&#39;t take a braniac 
like Ami to notice there&#39;s something there.&quot; Usagi simply blinked.

&quot;Or maybe it does,&quot; Makoto mumbled to herself. &quot;It&#39;s obvious that Rei 
has some sort of feelings for Minako just by the way she looks at her. 
Didn&#39;t you happen to notice the way she was staring at her when she 
climbed into the hot tub? Either Rei was spacing out big time or she has 
some serious lusting after Minako to take care of. Honestly, I think 
after the incident up in Minako&#39;s hotel room, seeing her that way kicked 
her memories into overdrive. Ami and I talked earlier today, and she 
agrees with me.&quot;

Usagi gasped. &quot;Hey! How come I wasn&#39;t included in that conversation? I&#39;m 
your princess, and I demand you let me listen on every word that passes 
between all of you!&quot;

Makoto chuckled.

&quot;You were probably busy drooling in your sleep, princess. We didn&#39;t want 
to disturb you.&quot;

&quot;I do NOT drool... Mamoru&#39;s a liar.&quot; Usagi crossed her arms and stuck 
her bottom lip out.

&quot;He&#39;s-not-lying-but ANYWAY,&quot; Makoto went on, rushing her first three 
words. Usagi looked indignant but she didn&#39;t say anything, instead 
choosing to sigh.

&quot;We&#39;re leaving Rei and Minako alone, and that&#39;s that. As Ami-chan said, 
&#39;If they&#39;re really meant to be together, the pieces will fall into place 
and everything will work out&#39;. I agree with her completely.&quot;

Usagi uncrossed her arms and headed towards the store&#39;s front window. 
She peered out at the passer-by&#39;s and then at the TV store across the 
street. Having close to perfect sight, she was able to spot a familiar 
face on the television. It of course was one of the two subjects under 
discussion: Aino Minako.

A grin that could rival the Cheshire Cat&#39;s spread across her face. Her 
mind was made up, and she wasn&#39;t going to let anyone get in the way of 
her mission.

Makoto spotted Usagi&#39;s crazy grin in the reflection of the window and 
grew uneasy. She gulped and then spoke up. &quot;Usagi...?&quot; She came out from 
behind the counter and slowly headed towards the girl. Before she was 
able to lay a hand on her shoulder,

&quot;HA!&quot; Usagi exclaimed, making Makoto jump a few feet.

&quot;Eh?! What?!&quot; The odango-haired woman turned on her heel and faced her 
friend, the colossal, overzealous grin still remaining.

&quot;Operation: Minako-chan &amp; Rei-chan&#39;s love-love, MAKE-UP!&quot;</pre>
