<h1>Someday Out of the Blue (part 1 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/immeblue.html">Immeblue</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It couldn&#39;t be her.&quot; Makoto couldn&#39;t believe her eyes, checking into 
the Hotel, only three line over was a woman she hadn&#39;t see in almost 
eighteen years. Even though her position in the waiting area didn&#39;t 
allow a full view of the woman&#39;s face, Makoto had an urgent feeling 
that its her. She watched as the woman left with the bellhop, all the 
while never allowing Makoto a full glimpse of her face.

Makoto was so absorbed with the woman that she didn&#39;t notice as a 
bellhop started to gather her luggage. &quot;Mako&quot; she did, however, notice 
her husband calling her name &quot;we&#39;re checked in hon, the bellhop will 
take us to our room.&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------

Makoto took in the opulence of the room and smiled. She was a humble 
person but every once in awhile liked to splurge and show off her 
wealth. It all went back to childhood, where the savings her parents 
left her only supplied her with a meager living, no room for 
extravagance. Although it taught her to be frugal and appreciative of 
what she had, Makoto never forgot what it felt like to want what she 
couldn&#39;t afford. Now there was almost nothing she couldn&#39;t have, and 
that thought made her smile grow brighter. However, it dimmed a bit 
when she laid eyes on her husband resting on the bed.

She had met him just out of cooking school at age 20. She was the 
assistant baker at a quaint little bakery in one of Tokyo&#39;s malls, 
when one day he strolled in for a chocolate chip muffin. Makoto was 
struck from the start, he was tall and handsome. Though he came in for 
a quick muffin, he ended up having three while he chatted up the 
excited young assistant. 

Makoto was surprised to see him back again the next day. She never 
expected in a million years that a successful businessman ten years 
her senior would be interested in her. It seemed to be more of a 
Minako thing than hers, but she wasn&#39;t about to complain, she liked 
his company, a lot. The manager/owner didn&#39;t mind him taking up her 
time as long as he kept buying baked goods the way he did. Some days 
he would leave with boxes of several dozen treats, praising Makoto on 
her baking skills and saying he had to share her cooking with the rest 
of his colleagues.

It took several more visits to the bakery for him to ask her out, and 
after about six months of dating bliss he finally popped the question. 
Makoto couldn&#39;t believe her ears when those glorious words escaped his 
lips. He was everything a girl could want, everything she wanted. 
Handsome, charismatic, and successful, the CEO of his father&#39;s 
advertisement agency. Above all she loved him, there was no way she 
would say no.

It wasn&#39;t long after they were married that Makoto began to feel 
bored. What was there for a wife of a wealthy businessman to do, but 
sit and look pretty. Makoto was deliriously happy when she recieved 
his cure for boredom. Her very own bakery. Well actually the money to 
start her very own bakery. Makoto did all the work herself; she found 
the location, assisted in the design, decorated the place, and hired 
help. As a grand opening present her husband, Koan, gave her shop free 
publicity for a few months. This resulted in Makoto&#39;s store becoming a 
big hit. She made some much money she offered to pay him back every 
cent her he loaned her to get started. She just loved him more when he 
said it wasn&#39;t a loan but a gift and told her to put the money to use 
for her.

Within a few years Makoto had seven bakeries spread across Japan 
making her treats. She could&#39;ve expanded wider, but she didn&#39;t want to 
get in over her head. The managers she employed at each bakery were 
competent, but Makoto did quiet a bit of traveling. Her belief was 
that an owner had to be apart of the everyday workings of the 
business, show there face to increase moral and loyalty. 

Now that Makoto had a business to run, her and Koan&#39;s schedules were 
in conflict. They rarely ever saw each other. Though, things happened 
so gradually and became so common, neither realized the damage being 
done. Makoto was accustomed to lonely nights away from home, and Koan 
to an occasional woman as substitute for his absent wife. 

After nearly fifteen years of marriage the effects of the inadvertent 
separation came crashing down on Makoto when she came home to find 
Koan &#145;entertaining&#39; the maid in their bedroom. She couldn&#39;t believe 
her eyes, lets just say the infamous &quot;Mako temper&quot; reared its head. 
The maid was lucky enough to have her bonnet when her bare bottom hit 
the pavement. Koan avoided it all, both bodily harm and verbal abuse, 
by shouting ten words: &quot;this would not have happened if you were home 
more.&quot; 

It stopped Makoto in her tracks and filled her with an immense sense 
of failure. There was a time when all she wanted was a family and home 
to take care of, with someone who loved her. She entered this marriage 
with every hope and intension of fulfilling that dream. Now it was 
obvious she was a failure.

That&#39;s why they are at the hotel now, to try and rekindle the romance. 
The incident was three months ago, both had relaxed their work load to 
spend more time together in hopes of saving their marriage. Makoto 
wanted this because she owed it to Koan and herself to realize that 
forgotten dream. And Koan wanted it because he didn&#39;t want a divorce.

Looking at her husband laying on the bed Makoto had a sinking feeling 
that this week was just prolonging the inevitable. Though with 
stubborn resolve she promised herself she&#39;d do everything in her power 
to make it work.
