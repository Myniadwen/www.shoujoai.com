<a href="../smoon/senshi5-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>Interlude: Christmas One

Rei Hino&#39;s expression didn&#39;t really change as she
swept the stone walkway outside the shrine, the air
cold with the onset of winter. Her long black hair
fell in a glossy wave, her red and white garb suiting
the intense young shrine maiden.

&quot;Are you serious about this?&quot; Rei looked up to ask.

The brown haired young woman sat with a casual ease on
the wooden steps that led up into the building, her
athletic body comfortably at rest. Makoto Kino leaned
forward, the sleeves of the forest green jacket that
the taller girl was wearing rolled up to reveal
muscular forearms, &quot;I think that a Christmas party
wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve only really begun to get to know each other,&quot;
Rei commented, but she didn&#39;t sound opposed to the
idea, merely making a point.

&quot;I doubt many of us have plans of Christmas,&quot; Makoto
pointed out to her gently, &quot;and I think Usagi could
use the break.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Rei conceded.

Rei knew that other people found her intense, even
driven, but Usagi Tsukino was beginning to worry even
her. The other girl was so focused on the defeat of
the Youma and their masters the Oni that she was
almost scary. Combine that with the grief that Usagi
still carried and you had someone who was under a
great deal of stress.

&quot;So who do we invite?&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;Ami Mizuno, Minako Aino and us,&quot; Makoto answered, &quot;if
they&#39;re willing.&quot;

The faint blush that appeared on Makoto&#39;s cheeks at
the mention of Ami&#39;s name made Rei fight back a smile.
The older scientist seemed to be in Makoto&#39;s thoughts
fairly often, and from what she had seen of Ami she
liked being around Makoto too. Of course it didn&#39;t
necessarily mean anything, but it was kind of cute to
watch.

&quot;Would a idol like Minako even go to a small Christmas
party?&quot; Rei raised an eyebrow, leaning her broom
against a post.

&quot;The only way we&#39;ll know is to ask,&quot; Makoto shrugged.
&quot;I&#39;m just wondering where we can hold it,&quot; she said
with a frown.

&quot;Here,&quot; Rei said simply. As Makoto looked at her in
surprise Rei smiled wryly, &quot;Usagi&#39;s is out for obvious
reasons, I&#39;d bet Ami just has a little apartment and I
wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable trying to impose on Minako
just yet.&quot;

&quot;And your Grandfather won&#39;t mind?&quot; Makoto asked. She
tilted her head to the side, &quot;He is an Shinto priest,
after all.&quot;

&quot;I think Gramps won&#39;t mind,&quot; Rei answered, &quot;he&#39;s just
happy that I&#39;m making friends at all.&quot;

Makoto got up, looking mildly surprised as she felt
something wet and damp tough her cheek. She looked up,
her lips stretching in a smile as she put her hand out
to catch another one, a flake of delicate snow. &quot;Good
omen,&quot; she looked over at Rei.

Rei nodded, the flakes gradually falling around them
like the petals of cherry blossoms. &quot;Then let&#39;s get to
work asking the others,&quot; she smiled.

The apartment building rose up in steel and glass,
ultra modern and priced so that only the most
exclusive could reside there. Makoto looked up, the
wind blowing her ponytail out as she murmured, &quot;This
sounded so much simpler yesterday.&quot;

The receptionists were two young ladies, stylishly
dressed and made up. Both looked at the scruffy woman
who entered with suspicion, the redhead especially
wary. &quot;Something I could do for you?&quot; she asked
stiffly.

&quot;Could you let Ms. Aino know that I&#39;m here?&quot; Makoto
asked, putting her hands in her pant&#39;s pockets
nervously.

&quot;I doubt that she&#39;d want to be disturbed by you,&quot; the
blue haired girl not even picking up the phone to call
upstairs.

Makoto really wanted to say something rude, but she
restrained herself. &quot;Maybe so,&quot; she agreed, &quot;but the
only way you&#39;ll know for sure is to call her.&quot; She
flashed a dangerous smile, &quot;Then you get to try to
kick me out.&quot;

The redhead gulped. &quot;Keep an eye on her,&quot; she ordered
the other girl as she dialed. It took only a few
moments before it was picked up, &quot;Ms. Aino, I&#39;m sorry
to disturb you... There&#39;s a young woman here to see
you, Makoto Kino.&quot; She stiffened visibly, listening as
her eyes got wide.

Makoto fought a smile, &#39;Wonder what Minako said to
her?&#39;

The phone clicked into the silence as it was returned
to it&#39;s cradle. The redhead looked sheepish, &quot;Ms.
Kino, you can go right up.&quot; She paused, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to
have inconvenienced you, there won&#39;t be any trouble
with entry in the future.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; and with a casual wave she walked to the
elevator, noting the two women&#39;s dumfounded looks as
the doors closed behind her. The proper floor was
reached and she strode down the hallway, knocking on
the front door.

Minako opened it in a moment and Makoto blinked in
surprise. The polished starlet was gone, instead her
blonde hair was messy and face devoid of makeup. She
wore a ratty robe, broken in and comfortable and was
wearing a pair of... bunny slippers.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Minako waved her inside, &quot;I was up late last
night at a industry party.&quot;

&#39;Wow,&#39; Makoto thought as she walked inside, the front
door opening into a massive livingroom. White couches
were set to either side, matching endtables beside
them and a massive entertainment center was up against
the wall.

&quot;I made a pot of coffee,&quot; Minako continued as she led
Makoto over to the well stocked but mostly unused
kitchen, &quot;would you like a cup?&quot;

&quot;Uh.. no, it&#39;s all right,&quot; Makoto answered as Minako
poured, adding sugar and cream.

&quot;So what brings you here today?&quot; Minako stirred her
cup then took a drink.

&quot;I guess you&#39;re really busy this time of year,&quot; Makoto
began to lead up to it.

&quot;A lot of industry parties,&quot; Minako agreed, &quot;places I
need to make an appearance and all that.&quot;

&quot;Are you going to be busy on Christmas eve?&quot; Makoto
asked.

Minako looked thoughtful, &quot;There is a event that
night...&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Makoto looked disappointed, &quot;we&#39;re holding a
little thing over at Rei&#39;s shrine that night, but I
guess you can&#39;t get away.&quot;

&quot;Are you kidding?&quot; Minako grinned. &quot;I&#39;d love to go,&quot;
she said eagerly, &quot;I haven&#39;t been to an intimate
Christmas party in years. What do I bring?&quot;

&quot;Just yourself,&quot; Makoto nearly laughed at the other
woman&#39;s energy, &quot;I&#39;m cooking, and gifts are optional.&quot;
As they talked on Makoto thought, &#39;I hope Rei is
having as much luck as I am.&#39;

Across town the kendo hall was noisy, the wooden
blades coming together loudly over the roar of the
crowd. The smaller figure seemed outmatched but she
moved swiftly, parrying attacks and striking back
swiftly. In a final flurry of motion the wooden sword
was turned aside then the smaller figure struck,
silence reigning after the blow was struck.

&quot;Point to Tsukino,&quot; the ref declared, &quot;the match goes
to Tsukino Usagi.&quot;

Usagi pulled her face gear off and offered her hand,
letting the taller young man shake it vigorously,
&quot;Good match, I hope we can do it again.&quot;

&#39;She really is good,&#39; Rei thought from where she stood
on the sidelines.

Usagi didn&#39;t even have a chance to divest herself of
her protective gear as fans and well wishers swamped
her, the slim blonde disappearing for a moment in the
crowd of people. It took a few moments for the champ
to break free then she walked to Rei&#39;s side, smiling
wearily as she said, &quot;You could have rescued me, you
know.&quot;

&quot;From your adoring fangirls?&quot; Rei smirked, &quot;I don&#39;t
think so.&quot;

Putting her helm down Usagi ran a hand over her blonde
hair, the long mane tied back into a tight braid.
Dressed like that, the padded suit almost made her
look like some samurai, weary from the wars. &quot;I still
don&#39;t know,&quot; she sighed, &quot;should we really be holding
a party now?&quot;

&quot;Even soldiers need a rest occasionally,&quot; Rei
shrugged, &quot;a chance to regain their strength before
the next battle comes.&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;s coming?&quot; Usagi asked, not committing herself to
it at all.

&quot;All four of us,&quot; Rei answered, &quot;at least, I think
so.&quot;

Usagi&#39;s lips lifted in a slight smile as she looked at
Rei thoughtfully, &quot;Don&#39;t the rest of you have better
things to do than holding a pity party to keep me from
getting depressed?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s no pity party,&quot; Rei felt herself getting angry
as she continued, &quot;I like Ami and Makoto, I&#39;m looking
forward to spending Christmas with them.&quot; Gentling her
voice a bit she added, &quot;And I&#39;d like to spend it with
you, too.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Usagi said a few seconds later.

Rei nodded slightly, reaching out to put her hand on
Usagi&#39;s arm. &quot;So, are you going to come?&quot; she asked
her again.

Usagi nodded, eyes twinkling a bit as she said, &quot;Yes,
I promise.&quot;

Rei watched Usagi walk away to get changed, noting
more of a bounce to the other girl&#39;s step. &#39;This may
do all of us some good,&#39; she mused.

Makoto didn&#39;t get to it until the next day, something
she blamed on being busy, but it was more than that.
The flutter of butterflies in her stomach showed
Makoto she was nervous, something that still surprised
her a little. She was a warrior, someone who had made
a name for herself fighting in the streets and alleys
of Tokyo, it was crazy that such a quiet and mature
older woman would make her feel so hesitant and
tentative.

Making herself move Makoto pressed the keys, listening
for a response from the intercom. A second later a
clearly cross Ami Mizuno barked, &quot;Who is it?&quot;

Makoto winced, wondering if she had come at a bad
time. &quot;It&#39;s Makoto,&quot; she answered, &quot;I was wondering if
I could talk to you?&quot;

Ami&#39;s harsh tone all but disappeared as she said, &quot;Of
course Makoto, I&#39;ll buzz you in.&quot;

Ami met her at the door, ushering her in even as
Makoto was apologizing, &quot;I hope I didn&#39;t interrupt
anything, I just wanted....&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Ami reassured her as she led Makoto
into the small apartment, &quot;my annoyance wasn&#39;t
directed at you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Makoto admitted as she took a look around.

The apartment was small, made even smaller by the
clutter around the room. The living room had the usual
couch and television but a worktable was up against
one wall, covered with partially assembled pieces of
technology. A computer was set up in the connected
dining area, a screensaver of snow falling on the
screen while the kitchen was spotlessly clean, if
filled with various pieces of time saving cookware
like a microwave, rice cooker and others.

Ami sat down, waving Makoto to a seat then took her
glasses off. Rubbing at her eyes tiredly she
explained, &quot;I just got off the phone with my mother,
we got into an argument when I told her I wasn&#39;t going
to the hospital Christmas party.&quot;

&quot;Your mother works there?&quot; Makoto asked.

&quot;Chief of surgery,&quot; Ami answered, adding irritably,
&quot;it seems there are some nice doctors that she wants
to introduce me to.&quot;

Makoto just had to smile at the tone of Ami&#39;s voice,
&quot;You&#39;re not interested in doctors?&quot;

&quot;Not ones introduced by my mother, no.&quot; Ami said
dryly.

Sensing the perfect opportunity Makoto leaned forward,
&quot;How would you like to go to a Christmas party with no
doctors at all?&quot;

Ami began to smile, &quot;Oh, yes.&quot;</pre>
