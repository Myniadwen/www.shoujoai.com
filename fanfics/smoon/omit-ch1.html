<h1>Chibi Usa and Hotaru:  One Moment in Time</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/aaron.html">Aaron</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;Hotaru!&quot;

Chibi Usa squealed as she ran to her best friend in the world and 
hugged her tightly. Hotaru put her arms around Chibi Usa and tenderly 
hugged her back, accompanying her hug with a soft kiss on the cheek.

Hotaru had been visiting Haruka and Michiru for two weeks.  She felt 
it right to visit them every so often since she considered them her 
surrogate parents.  But  from now on, Crystal Tokyo was her home.  It 
had been her home for many years.

The greatest joy of her life was watching her best friend, Chibi Usa 
grow up.  The last years were a giddy thrill to Hotaru, bearing 
witness to the blossoming womanhood of someone who had been her best 
friend for centuries.  Someone she had grown to love more deeply than 
even Chibi Usa really knew.  Hotaru loved Chibi Usa more than life 
itself.

After over 900 years, Chibi Usa&#39;s body had finally grown into a 
healthy, attractive girl of 17.  Her pink hair was still in the cone-
shaped pom-pom style she&#39;d always worn, although it was much longer, 
reaching down just below her knees.  Her body was soft and slender, 
with curved, shapely legs and her breasts were almost as large as her 
mother&#39;s. But they still weren&#39;t fully developed yet, so her breasts 
would eventually grow larger.

To see that beautiful girl bounce down the Palace steps to greet her 
just made Hotaru smile.  To feel Chibi Usa&#39;s arms around her brought 
on such a feeling of indescribable joy, Hotaru felt like she was 
going to cry.  Chibi Usa had been her first friend.  A friend through 
thick and thin, at a time when friends were all too few for Hotaru.  
Over the years, they&#39;ve laughed and cried together. But through it 
all, their friendship never wavered and Chibi Usa never once judged 
her.  Hotaru loved Chibi Usa for that.  And over the years that love 
continued to grow until it had grown beyond love for a friend, even 
beyond love for a lover.

&quot;Welcome home,&quot; said Chibi Usa, &quot;I missed you.  I&#39;m really glad 
you&#39;re back.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so glad to be back,&quot; Hotaru replied, &quot;I missed you so much.&quot;

Chibi Usa leaned over and whispered in Hotaru&#39;s ear.

&quot;I hope you don&#39;t want to repeat what happened two weeks ago.  You 
didn&#39;t
miss me that much did you?&quot;

Both their minds darted back to two weeks ago, before Hotaru left.


They were both sitting on Chibi Usa&#39;s bed in her room.  They were 
both just Wearing panties and cotton button-up shirts.  They were 
talking about something, neither one of them could quite remember 
what, because what happened after made the whole conversation seem 
pointless.

Chibi Usa was talking and Hotaru was looking at her.  Suddenly, Chibi 
Usa looked up and saw that Hotaru had looked away, her creamy white 
cheeks blushing a bright pink. Although, Hotaru felt that her whole 
body was blushing.

&quot;Hotaru, is something wrong?&quot; Chibi Usa asked immediately.

&quot;I&#133;uh, well uh&#133;.I&#133;&quot;, was Hotaru&#39;s only response.

Chibi Usa took her hand.

&quot;Come on,&quot; she said softly, &quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;I uh&#133;I want&#133;to&#133;be&#133;well, I don&#39;t know how to say this.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;  Chibi Usa was beginning to look concerned.

&quot;touched,&quot; Hotaru said softly, almost under her breath, &quot;I&#133;want&#133;to 
be&#133;touched.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?  I&#39;m touching you right now.&quot;  Chibi Usa said, 
still holding her hand.

&quot;No, no.  Not that&#133;kind of touching.&quot;

Chibi Usa&#39;s thought for a moment.  Then her eyes widened.

&quot;What?  You mean&#133;that kind of touching?&quot;

Hotaru didn&#39;t reply, she just lightly nodded.

&quot;Well&#133;I guess, if you wanted to.  I mean, I&#39;ve seen you touch 
yourself before.  It&#39;s no big deal.  Just let me make sure the door&#39;s 
locked first before you start.&quot;

&quot;No, no.  I don&#39;t want to masturbate.  I&#133;want&#133;another person to touch 
me.&quot;

&quot;What other person?  What are you talking about?  You want someone to 
touch you?&quot;

Again Hotaru just lightly nodded.

&quot;Who?&quot;

&quot;Well&#133;before I answer that, I just want you to know that I&#39;ve thought 
long and hard about this, for a long time.  I wanted the person to 
touch me to be someone I loved, someone I really cared about.  I know 
who I want to do it, but I&#39;m afraid to ask.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Chibi Usa was still holding her hand, &quot;Who is it?&quot;

Hotaru was still looking away.

&quot;Hotaru, Come on.  You can tell me.  Who is it?&quot;

Hotaru turned and looked at Chibi Usa, her violet eyes filled with 
longing, but at the same time, they had a hint of guilt.  Chibi Usa&#39;s 
eyes nearly popped out of her sockets and she fell off the bed.

&quot;Me?!?!?!&quot; she sputtered as she picked herself up, &quot;You want me to 
touch you?!&quot;

&quot;I was afraid you&#39;d feel that way, &quot;Hotaru said, with obvious 
disappointment in her voice.

&quot;Hotaru, now just wait a minute.  Wait just a second.  Now let&#39;s back 
up and slow down. I mean&#133;why me?  Why do you want me to touch you?&quot;

Hotaru put her hands over Chibi Usa&#39;s.

&quot;Because, it&#39;s like I said before.  I want it to be someone I love.  
You&#39;ve been my best friend for years.  You&#39;ve always stood by me.  I 
love you Chibi Usa.  I love you with all my heart and soul.&quot;

&quot;Well, I love you too Hotaru, but I don&#39;t know how I feel about this.  
I mean, something just doesn&#39;t sound right.&quot;

&quot;Chibi Usa, I know you don&#39;t have the same love for me as I do for 
you.  I understand that.  But I&#39;m not asking to touch you and I&#39;m not 
asking us to make love.&quot;

Hotaru held Chibi Usa&#39;s hands tighter.

&quot;I just want to feel you touching me, just once.  I love you so much.  
Just for one time, I want to give myself to you, completely.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.  I just don&#39;t know how I feel about this.  I&#39;ve got to 
think about this for a while.&quot;

&quot;I&#133;I understand.  This is a big deal.  I&#39;d&#133;I&#39;d better go now, before 
I make things worse.&quot;

Hotaru got up from the bed and walked out of the bedroom.  Although 
it was pretty obvious to Chibi Usa what she was thinking.  She 
already suspected that Chibi Usa would say no and if that happened, 
what would that bode for their friendship?  Chibi Usa knew they would 
still love each other.  Love is stronger than that.  But what would 
they do with this specter floating over them now?

Chibi Usa was lucky to get any sleep that night.  But she was wide 
awake early the next morning.  Part of her wanted to talk to Hotaru 
about the night before, but she couldn&#39;t find her and she could tell 
right away that Hotaru was avoiding her.  Chibi Usa really couldn&#39;t 
blame her.  If she were in the same position, she&#39;d want to lay low 
for a little while too.

She spent the better part of the morning walking around the Crystal 
Palace, wondering what to do.  Her and Hotaru had masturbated 
together before, the first time when she was 16.  But touching Chibi 
Usa touching Hotaru?  Finally deciding that this was over her head, 
she went off in search of advice.

&quot;I have to say, I&#39;m curious.  Why all these questions about love all 
of a sudden?&quot;  Ami asked.

&quot;Well, I just have a friend who&#39;s having a bit of a personal 
problem,&quot; Chibi Usa said, as she helped Ami enter new data into the 
Palace computer, &quot;She has a friend she really loves and she wants to 
go a bit further than friendship.  I&#39;m just not sure how her friend 
feels.&quot;

&quot;How much farther does she want to go?&quot; Ami asked.

&quot;That&#39;s&#133;personal.&quot;

&quot;Oh&#133;I see.&quot;

Ami thought for a moment.

&quot;Well, has she made her feelings known to this person?&quot;

&quot;Vividly.&quot; Chibi Usa rolled her eyes slightly.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m afraid there&#39;s nothing to do but wait and see what her 
friend does.&quot;

Well, thanks for nothing, Chibi Usa thought to herself.  Talking to 
her just left me right where I started.

&quot;I can tell you this,&quot; Ami said, &quot;From what you&#39;ve told me, this 
doesn&#39;t sound like a frivolous request.  She must love this person 
very much.  There was one time when I asked a personal favor.  I 
won&#39;t go into detail, but it was from someone I love very much.&quot;

&quot;What did he do.&quot;

&quot;&#39;She&#39; actually.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you get any ecchi thoughts, young lady.&quot;

&quot;Never.  My lips are sealed too.  So what happened.&quot;

&quot;Well, she helped me.  I&#39;m not saying our friendship was affected, 
although we did become a little closer, but I was afraid of what 
would happen.  I wasn&#39;t sure until after that I&#39;d made the right 
decision, but afterwards, it felt right.  I&#39;d like to think I&#39;m 
better off now for having that experience then.  That&#39;s about all the 
advice I can give you on the subject.&quot;

&quot;Well, maybe&#133;Thanks Ami.&quot;

Chibi Usa walked off.  Ami made a good case, but Chibi Usa still 
wasn&#39;t sure what to do at that point.  What happens afterward and 
touching Hotaru didn&#39;t feel like the right decision to make?  So she 
went to talk to someone with a little more experience with her 
problem.

&quot;Yuki?  What do you want to know about her?&quot; Makoto asked.

&quot;I just have a friend who has a personal problem and I thought you 
might be able to give me some advice that would help her.  I mean, 
you and Yuki are friends, but Yuki wanted more than friendship, 
right?&quot; Chibi Usa said.  She was helping Makoto bake chocolate chip 
cookies.

&quot;Well, yes, but that didn&#39;t last.  I told her that I wasn&#39;t 
interested in that kind of a relationship.  Uh, you might want to put 
more sugar in that batter.  You know your mother likes them sweet.&quot;

&quot;Oh, right.  So she stopped flirting with you?&quot;

&quot;Are you kidding?  She was constantly flirting with me.  She 
sometimes does it even now.  I admit, there were times it got a 
little annoying.  But she never got anywhere.&quot;

&quot;So how have you two stayed friends for so long with all that 
pressure?&quot;

&quot;Well, I just accepted her actions towards me as part of our 
friendship. She isn&#39;t a bad person and she isn&#39;t ecchi either.  She 
just has her own way of  acting around me.  Her actions haven&#39;t 
changed who we are.  I don&#39;t know if that helps your friend or not, 
but it couldn&#39;t hurt.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Makoto.&quot;

Chibi Usa was still unsure.  Touching Hotaru in such private places, 
it was an enormous step.  This could change the face of their entire 
friendship, in spite of what Makoto said.

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know what I could tell you,&quot; Rei said, &quot;I mean, this 
is a really private situation.&quot;

&quot;I know Rei, but my friend really doesn&#39;t know what to do.&quot;

&quot;Well, if we&#39;re going to talk, you can help me clean these floors.&quot;

&quot;Oh sure,&quot; Chibi Usa picked up a brush to help Rei scrub the temple 
floor, &quot;but I&#39;m in a bit of a hurry.&quot;

&quot;Well, any help you can give me is appreciated.  It&#39;s less work for 
me to do.  As for your problem, I think I had a situation that can 
relate to this problem.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;I actually can&#39;t believe I&#39;m telling this story again.  It was so 
long ago. There was a time I thought I wanted to be more than friends 
with someone.  I actually had a dream about it.  It was&#133; another&#133; 
girl&#133; actually.&quot; Rei couldn&#39;t help but blush, even after all these 
years, it was still a strange feeling for her to talk about it.

&quot;Really?  Who?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not important,&quot; Rei went back to scrubbing, &quot;I don&#39;t mind 
telling you though, I was scared to death.  I literally didn&#39;t sleep 
for a week.  It wasn&#39;t pleasant.&quot;

&quot;So what did you do?&quot;

&quot;I eventually talked to her about it.  It&#39;s not like I had much 
choice under the circumstances, but somehow it made us both feel a 
lot better.  And after a while, I realized that I didn&#39;t have the 
feelings I thought I had.&quot;

&quot;That might be an idea.  Thanks Rei.&quot;

&quot;Well, I guess it helped, but I don&#39;t see how.  Now let&#39;s finish this 
floor and you can be on your way.&quot;

Rei might be right Chibi Usa thought.  Maybe Hotaru doesn&#39;t really 
want this.  She only thinks she does.  Then again, maybe I&#39;m just 
rationalizing.

&quot;What do you think of this one?&quot; Minako asked, holding the dress in 
front of her.

&quot;If you were Ami, I&#39;d say go for it,&quot; Chibi Usa said, &quot;But blue isn&#39;t 
really your color.&quot;

Minako let out a groan of frustration and threw the dress onto the 
bed next to where Chibi Usa was sitting.

&quot;Well, I&#39;ve got to wear something.  I mean, I can&#39;t show up on a date 
in just my bra and panties, can I?&quot;

&quot;Not unless you want to send a pretty strong signal to your date.  
Anyway, about my friend&#39;s problem.&quot;

Minako let her problem go for the moment and sat next to Chibi Usa.

&quot;Okay, okay.  Hmmm.  Well, I remember one time not too long ago I had 
this friend.  He was handsome and pretty smart.  We thought we could 
have a relationship.  So we went out once, to give it a try.&quot;

&quot;What happened?  The date didn&#39;t work out?&quot;

&quot;No, the date was perfect.  The dinner, the dancing.  We even kissed 
at the end of the night.&quot;

&quot;So what happened?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.  Something just didn&#39;t click, you know.  Something 
just didn&#39;t feel right. Don&#39;t get me wrong, we&#39;re still friends.  But 
we just didn&#39;t know how to be more than that.  I don&#39;t know, I hope 
that helps.&quot;

&quot;Well, thanks Minako.  That helps a little.&quot;  Chibi Usa ran out of 
the room, but peeked her head back in quickly.

&quot;By the way, I like the red one in the corner.&quot;

Minako looked and then squealed in delight.

&quot;Perfect!&quot;

Well, I&#39;ve talked to the others and I&#39;m still no closer to finding 
the answers to my questions than when I started, Chibi Usa thought.  
From what I got from Ami and Makoto, it could be a good thing, but 
what if it&#39;s not?  From Rei and
Minako, Hotaru deep down might not even want this.  What do I do?

&quot;So after all that you finally decide to come to your parents,&quot;  
Usagi giggled.

Chibi Usa flashed a tiny glare.

&quot;Look, I&#39;m sorry.  I just think it&#39;s funny, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;Look, can you help me please?  I still don&#39;t know what to do.&quot;

&quot;Your awfully concerned about this,&quot; Mamoru said, &quot;Is there something 
your not telling us?&quot;

&quot;Look, I just want to help, okay.  Can you give me some kind of 
advice?&quot;

&quot;Well, to be honest, I don&#39;t know what we can tell you,&quot; Usagi said, 
&quot;We don&#39;t have all the answers.  We can&#39;t say what decision is the 
right one to make, because it&#39;s not our decision.  I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re 
just going to have to wait and see what your friends decide to do.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not as comforting as I&#39;d like to think,&quot; Chibi Usa said as 
she walked off.

&quot;Chibi Usa,&quot;  Mamoru called.  Chibi Usa turned.

&quot;We can tell you this.  The only way your friends are going to be 
truly happy is if they both do what they feel they should do, not 
what they think they should do.&quot;

Chibi Usa stood and thought for a moment.  Then she smiled, ran up 
and hugged Usagi and Mamoru.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said, &quot;Believe it or not, that was a big help.&quot;

She darted off down the hall as Usagi and Mamoru looked at each 
other. Usagi had a confused look on her face.

&quot;Don&#39;t look at me,&quot; Mamoru said, shrugging his shoulders, &quot;She&#39;s your 
daughter.&quot;

&quot;Oh thanks a lot,&quot; Usagi punched him in the arm.

&quot;I was just kidding.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, sure you were.&quot;

It was night.  Hotaru was walking down the hallway to her bedroom.  
She was wishing she didn&#39;t have to walk past Chibi Usa&#39;s room to get 
there.  She had spent the entire day racked with guilt.  She wanted 
to be touched by Chibi Usa, she couldn&#39;t deny that.  But what kind of 
person was she to just come out and hand it to her as if it were an 
ultimatum.  Chibi Usa was her best friend, someone she loved more 
than anything.  How could she put someone she loved so much through 
that kind of pressure?  More importantly, what would Chibi Usa think 
of her now?

Suddenly, Hotaru felt someone grab her arm and pull her into a room.  
As soon as she got her bearings, she realized she was in Chibi Usa&#39;s 
room.  Chibi Usa was holding her shoulders and had her pinned to the 
wall.

&quot;Owww!&quot; Hotaru cried out on instinct.

&quot;Now listen,&quot; Chibi Usa said, &quot;You&#39;ve been avoiding me all day.  Now 
I&#39;ve done a lot of thinking too, and as far as last night goes, I 
have just one thing to say to you&#133;&quot;

Oh no, Hotaru thought.  As if out of nowhere, tears started streaming 
down her pale cheeks.

&quot;Please, Chibi Usa.&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.  It&#39;s my fault.  You don&#39;t 
have to do anything.  I want us to stay friends.  You mean everything 
to me.  I j-just want-ted&#133;&quot;

Hotaru&#39;s words were cut off as she started sobbing uncontrollably.  
Chibi Usa was stunned and did the only thing she could do.  She threw 
he arms around Hotaru and held her tight.  She led Hotaru over to her 
bed and never stopped hugging her.

&quot;It&#39;s okay.  Just calm down.  Calm down.  I&#39;m not mad at you.&quot;

&quot;You&#133;you&#39;re not?&quot;

&quot;You just surprised me last night, that&#39;s all.  It confused me.  Come 
on, you know I could never be mad at you.  You&#39;ll always be my 
friend.&quot;

Chibi Usa lifted Hotaru&#39;s chin so she could see her face.

&quot;And I&#39;ll always love you.&quot;

Hotaru hugged Chibi Usa as her final sobs faded away.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Chibi Usa asked.

&quot;I&#39;m feeling better now.&quot;

&quot;Good, because I wanted you to know I&#39;ve made a decision.  But first 
I want to know one thing.&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot; Hotaru&#39;s feeling of dread returned.

Chibi Usa looked her square in the eyes.  Her eyes had a deadly 
seriousness.

&quot;I want you to tell me, are you absolutely certain that this is what 
you want?  You want me to touch you?&quot;

Hotaru smiled as another tear managed to trickle down her cheek.

&quot;With all my heart.&quot; she sighed.

Chibi Usa smiled back.

&quot;Well then there&#39;s only one thing to do.&quot;

Chibi Usa started unbuttoning Hotaru&#39;s shirt.  At first, Hotaru was 
overjoyed at the concept of finally being touched by someone she&#39;d 
loved so much for so long.
But then she suddenly grabbed Chibi Usa&#39;s hands and held them.

&quot;Are you sure you really want to do this.  The last thing I wanted 
was to pressure you.&quot;

&quot;Hotaru, I have to be honest.  Right now, I don&#39;t know if I want to 
do this. But I won&#39;t know that answer until it&#39;s done.  We&#39;ll worry 
about my feelings when the time is right.&quot;

Chibi Usa freed her hands from Hotaru and continued unbuttoning her 
shirt.

&quot;Right now, this is your time.&quot;

Hotaru closed her eyes and she could feel her shirt sliding off her 
chest and her shoulders.  Then there was a pause.

&quot;Hotaru?&quot; Chibi Usa said.  Hotaru opened her eyes.

&quot;Do you want me to take off my clothes too?&quot;

Hotaru looked at her for a moment.

&quot;Could you let me do it?  Please?&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot;

Chibi Usa lifted her arms and Hotaru pulled her shirt over her head.  
Then Hotaru began to unfasten Chibi Usa&#39;s pants as Chibi Usa 
unfastened Hotaru&#39;s skirt.  Chibi Usa stepped out of her pants and 
then helped slide Hotaru&#39;s skirt down her legs.  Chibi Usa sat back 
down on the bed and both girls reached around to unfasten each 
others&#39; bras. After removing their bras, Chibi Usa stood up again and 
took off her panties. Hotaru laid back and let Chibi Usa slide her 
panties off.  As Chibi Usa removed Hotaru&#39;s panties, Hotaru spread 
her legs slightly to give Chibi Usa a momentary glimpse of her smooth 
sex.  Chibi Usa looked and was amazed by it, since she&#39;d never really 
looked at it before, even after all the times they&#39;d masturbated.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe it.  It&#39;s so pink.&quot;  She said.

&quot;So is yours.  Yours is really pink too,&quot; Hotaru replied.

Chibi Usa sat back down.  There they were, both naked, sitting on the 
bed, but there was still that air of uncertainty.

&quot;So&#133;where do we go from here?&quot; Chibi Usa asked nervously.  Hotaru 
however, was
surprisingly calm.

&quot;Well, how about you start like this?&quot;

Hotaru took Chibi Usa&#39;s hand and placed them on her breasts.  She 
placed her hand&#39;s over Chibi Usa&#39;s hands and motioned Chibi Usa&#39;s 
fingers to squeeze.  As Chibi Usa began to squeeze her breasts, 
Hotaru let her head back and sighed softly.

&quot;Mmmmm&#133;That feels so good,&quot; she said.

Chibi Usa took her word for it.  She still couldn&#39;t believe that she 
was doing this, but for some reason she couldn&#39;t explain, she had the 
strong urge to continue.  She felt some kind of odd satisfaction at 
being able to make her best friend so happy.

&quot;Could you pinch my nipples now, please?  I&#39;d really love it if you 
did that,&quot; Hotaru said.

Chibi Usa took Hotaru nipples between her thumbs and forefingers and 
began lightly pinching them, while her other fingers continued to 
squeeze Hotaru&#39;s breasts as best they could.  Hotaru&#39;s breasts 
weren&#39;t very big, but her nipples got hard and they stood straight 
out like two fleshy bullets.  Then her breasts became firm and stuck 
out like her nipples.

Hotaru began to whimper tiny moans of pleasure.  This was her moment.  
She was being touched and pleasured by her best friend, something 
she&#39;d desired, hoped for and prayed for, for so long.  Now it was 
happening and it all felt so right.

She began to maneuver herself to sit in front of Chibi Usa, with her 
back to her, taking care that Chibi Usa kept pleasuring her breasts.  
Then she took Chibi Usa&#39;s left hand and placed it over her sex, 
motioning for her to rub.  Chibi Usa felt Hotaru&#39;s wet sex and was 
surprised.

Wow, she thought, Hotaru must really have wanted this.  She&#39;s so hot 
and wet already.

Chibi Usa started rubbing and Hotaru&#39;s moans became louder and louder  
She pressed her back against Chibi Usa&#39;s breasts and draped her head 
back over Chibi
Usa&#39;s shoulder.  Chibi Usa was squeezing her breasts and rubbing her 
sex, just like Hotaru had always wanted.  She didn&#39;t want it to stop.  
She wanted more pleasure and she knew would get it soon.  She could 
feel her orgasm building.

&quot;Don&#39;t stop Chibi Usa.  Please don&#39;t stop,&quot; Hotaru begged, &quot;This 
feels so wonderful, and I&#39;m so close.  I&#39;m going to come.&quot;

Chibi Usa kept rubbing.  Then she felt a large bump on Hotaru&#39;s sex.  
She left her finger there for a moment and she could feel the 
throbbing.  Then she heard Hotaru let out a huge gasp and she was 
sure.  She&#39;d found Hotaru&#39;s clit, and it was so swollen.  Smiling 
inwardly at her triumph,  Chibi Usa lightly stroked Hotaru&#39;s clit 
with her forefinger.  She could tell by Hotaru&#39;s increasing moans 
that she liked that, so she started poking at her clit with her 
finger.  Hotaru liked that even more, so Chibi Usa did one last 
thing, taking the swollen organ between her thumb and forefinger and 
giving it light, rapid pinches.  That was all Hotaru could stand.

&quot;Oh Chibi Usa!&quot; she cried, &quot;Chibi Usa, I have to lay down!  I&#39;m 
coming!  I&#39;m coming!&quot;

Chibi Usa slid off the bed as Hotaru crashed on the pillows and came. 
Moaning loudly and squirming around on the bed, Hotaru rubbed her sex 
feverishly, desperately trying to soothe it.  Eventually, her 
shuddering subsided.

&quot;So how was it?&quot; Chibi Usa asked.

&quot;That&#133;that was so incredible, I can&#39;t even describe it,&quot; Hotaru 
gasped, still breathless from her orgasm.

Chibi Usa got up from the floor and then shuddered at the sensation.  
She stopped for a moment.  She was so busy pleasuring Hotaru, she 
hadn&#39;t noticed her own sex becoming hot and dripping wet.

&quot;Oh man,&quot;  she whimpered.

&quot;What?&quot;  Hotaru had managed to catch her breath.

&quot;Why did you have to enjoy yourself so much,&quot; Chibi Usa scolded her, 
&quot;Now I&#39;m all hot and wet too.&quot;

&quot;Sorry.&quot; Hotaru giggled.

&quot;It&#39;s not funny,&quot; Chibi Usa whined, &quot;Now I want to touch myself.&quot;

&quot;I thought you liked touching yourself.&quot;

&quot;I do.  But only when I want to do it.  I didn&#39;t want to do it 
before.  Now it&#39;s like I have no choice.&quot;

&quot;Well you might as well get it over with.  There&#39;s no point in 
complaining about it now.&quot;

Chibi Usa slumped down on the floor beside her bed and spread her 
legs.

&quot;Ooooohhh, I can&#39;t stand it anymore.&quot;

&quot;Wait!  Wait!  Wait!&quot;  Hotaru grabbed a pillow and lay on her front 
in front of Chibi Usa.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Chibi Usa asked.

&quot;I want to watch.  I want to see your hands give you the same 
pleasure you just gave me. And it&#39;s not like I&#39;ve never watched you 
before.&quot;

&quot;Oh all right.&quot;

Chibi Usa&#39;s fingers headed straight for her clit.  This was an 
unplanned masturbation and she wanted to get it over with as soon as 
possible.  She could feel the heat from her clit even before she 
touched it.

As soon as she touched her clit, she felt like she was going to 
burst, but she didn&#39;t.  She began rubbing immediately, desperately 
trying to make herself come.  She started moaning and squirming on 
the floor as she rubbed faster and harder.  Finally realizing rubbing 
wasn&#39;t enough, she started slapping her clit almost viciously, harder 
and harder.

&quot;Come on,&quot; she moaned to herself, &quot;Come on!&quot;

Hotaru just lay there, fascinated by Chibi Usa&#39;s rather unique 
display. After about two minutes, Chibi Usa threw her head back and 
came, shuddering for a few
seconds, then calming down.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Hotaru asked, concerned.

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Chibi Usa replied, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I just didn&#39;t feel 
like masturbating and I wanted to get it over with quick.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about me, I&#39;m worried about you.  You&#39;re going to be 
really sensitive and sore tomorrow.&quot;

Hotaru slowly inched up to Chibi Usa and two sat side by side, naked. 
Hotaru knew what came next, but she was almost afraid to ask.

&quot;So&#133;what about us?  We can&#39;t just forget what just happened.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right.  There&#39;s only one thing to do.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Hotaru wasn&#39;t sure she wanted to hear the answer.

Chibi Usa opened her arms to Hotaru and smiled.

&quot;Come here.&quot;

Both girls hugged each other tenderly.

&quot;Did you enjoy tonight?&quot; Chibi Usa asked, &quot;Was it everything you 
wanted?&quot;

&quot;Yes.  It was everything I wanted.  Someone I love more than anything 
gave me the greatest pleasure I could imagine.&quot;

Then Chibi Usa surprised Hotaru again, inching forward and gently 
kissing her on the lips.

&quot;Then don&#39;t forget.  I don&#39;t want you to ever forget.  I don&#39;t know 
about me, but you keep tonight in your heart, for me.  Otherwise, 
tonight was all for
nothing.&quot;

&quot;I promise you, no matter what, even if I find true love, I&#39;ll always 
treasure this moment for as long as I live.&quot;

The two girls just sat beside Chibi Usa&#39;s bed, holding each other.

&quot;Chibi Usa?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Can we stay like this for a while?  It feels warm and safe.&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot;

Both girls fell asleep in each others&#39; arms.


&quot;Well?&quot;  Chibi Usa&#39;s voice snapped Hotaru back to reality.

&quot;Chibi Usa, nothing we ever did again could repeat that night,&quot; 
Hotaru whispered to her, &quot;That night was too special to ever 
replace.&quot;

Chibi Usa hugged Hotaru again and sighed.

&quot;Great, now let&#39;s go.  Mom and Dad wanted to see you as soon as you 
got back.&quot;

Chibi Usa took Hotaru&#39;s hand and Hotaru savored the warm feeling.

&quot;So how was it with Haruka and Michiru?&quot;

&quot;It was great.  Haruka-papa and Michiru-mama are always good to me.  
It&#39;s
nice to know I have two places I can call home.&quot;

Chibi Usa giggled.

&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;Nothing.  I just like how you still call them Haruka-papa and 
Michiru-mama.&quot;

&quot;Really?  You don&#39;t think it&#39;s silly now to keep calling them that?&quot;

&quot;Of course not.  I think it&#39;s really cute when you do that.  It&#39;s one 
of the things I love about you.&quot;

Hotaru&#39;s pale cheeks blushed bright pink, much as she had done two 
weeks ago and she smiled as Chibi Usa walked with her up the Palace 
steps.  And she kept on smiling for the rest of the day.

To Audience:  This was a little longer than my other stories.  
Although if you take &quot;Second Honeymoon&quot; and combine the chapters, I 
guess it&#39;s not all that long. Anyway, tell me if you liked the story 
and if you didn&#39;t, why not.  Don&#39;t forget to pass any ideas along to 
me along if you want to see them written.  You know my address.
