&quot;The top story of the hour: A jewelry heist thwarted by the one and only Sailor V.&quot; 

All five of the Sailor Scouts and their cats sat uncomfortably watching the news as the 
anchorman talked about the events of that day. 

&quot;For those of you who are unfamiliar with Sailor V, she appeared in Japan a number of years 
ago fighting an evil agency bent on stealing human energy, later dubbed The Negaverse. She 
became an icon, staring in her own manga, her own video game, and even appeared on The Late 
Show with David Letterman-&quot; 

A clip from the Late Show played with Sailor V flashing Letterman, and his reaction. Raye 
gave Mina a dirty look. The blonde smiled innocently before Raye turned her attention back 
to the TV. 

&quot;Sailor V disappeared not long after the Sailor Scouts appeared, led by the famous Japanese 
super heroine, Sailor Moon. It has been long suggested that Sailor V is connected to the 
Sailor Scouts in some way. The same has been asked about this new Sailor A, who was 
responsible for saving a wounded officer&#39;s life. Although the city is excited to hear about 
Sailor V appearing, many are wondering if Sailor Moon is here in New York.&quot; 

Luna groaned, &quot;I can&#39;t watch this anymore.&quot; 

Raye turned off the TV. Her unusual silence was more frightening than anything. 

&quot;What were you thinking?&quot; Luna snapped at Mina. Mina looked at Luna with innocent eyes. 
&quot;I&#39;d expect this from Serena, but not from you.&quot; 

&quot;Luna,&quot; Mina replied, &quot;Would it have been better if I had just not done anything and let 
those guys get away with murder?&quot; 

Luna didn&#39;t know how to respond to that. 

&quot;We know you&#39;re heart was in the right place Mina,&quot; Artemis spoke to her softly, &quot;But this 
media coverage is exactly what we were hoping to avoid.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s not that big of a deal guys,&quot; Mina raised her hands, &quot;Sailor V was the hero today, 
not Sailor Moon. Not even Sailor Venus. They don&#39;t have any proof that I work with her.&quot; 

&quot;But Sailor Moon is now front-page news!&quot; Luna continued. &quot;That&#39;s exactly what we were 
trying to escape.&quot; 

&quot;If I was looking for her,&quot; Lita chimed in with a calm voice, &quot;I&#39;d be on my way to New York 
right now!&quot; 

Mina put her head down. Raye still sat there cross-armed. 

&quot;But guys,&quot; Serena jumped up, &quot;She did what she was supposed to do. She&#39;s Sailor Venus!&quot; 

&quot;Serena,&quot; Luna snapped at her, &quot;There is an obscene bounty on your head. Not just enemies 
from the Negaverse, but any contract killer or low-life in the world is looking for you.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Lita said, &quot;New York City is full of mob guys who would jump at the opportunity to 
take out Sailor Moon.&quot; 

Serena sat down and surrendered to the gravity of the situation. 

&quot;We&#39;re really not a team anymore,&quot; Amy sat there with her hand on her cheek. 

&quot;Amy,&quot; Luna&#39;s voice consoled her, &quot;Of course we&#39;re still a team. Now look, maybe nothing 
will come out of this, but we need to start laying low right now.&quot; 

&quot;Fine by me,&quot; Lita added. &quot;I gotta start looking for another cooking job,&quot; She looked to 
Mina, &quot;Since I just got fired.&quot; 

&quot;All right,&quot; Artemis tried to distract everyone, &quot;What do you say we all go out and get 
some pizza.&quot; 

&quot;Yay!&quot; Serena jumped up and down repeatedly, &quot;Pizza! Pizza!&quot; 

Lita laughed, &quot;Take it easy there Little Ceasar.&quot; Serena ran into the room to get ready. 
Lita went over to nudge Mina on the shoulder, &quot;Don&#39;t get down on yourself Mina. You DID 
nail those guys pretty good.&quot; She smiled. 

Mina smiled back and gave her a fist bump. Everyone else left the living room, except for 
Raye, who still sat there in anger. A long awkward silence ensued between her and Mina. 
Finally Mina slapped her hands on her legs and looked right at her: 

&quot;Look, if you&#39;re gonna say something, just say it!&quot; 

Raye finally turned her head to Mina: &quot;You lied to me. Why didn&#39;t you tell me you were 
going out as Sailor V?&quot; 

Mina raised her eyebrows, &quot;Would you have let me go?&quot; 

Raye didn&#39;t blink, &quot;I left Japan behind Mina. I left the temple behind, I left my 
grandfather behind, and I left Sailor Mars behind. I actually thought, here&#39;s a chance to 
start a new life, with the girl I love.&quot; A few seconds of silence. &quot;But how can I do that 
if my girlfriend won&#39;t do the same?&quot; 

There was a long silence. 

&quot;I can&#39;t do that Raye.&quot; 

Raye held back tears, &quot;Fine.&quot; She got up and grabbed her coat off the seat of the couch. &quot;I 
guess we should go our separate ways then.&quot; 

Mina&#39;s jaw dropped. She stood up and walked slowly towards the raven-hair, &quot;What you&#39;re 
breaking up with me?&quot; 

&quot;No,&quot; Raye said putting her jacket on, &quot;I&#39;m breaking up with Sailor V. When Minako Aino 
decides she wants to settle down, I&#39;ll be right here waiting for her.&quot; 

Mina sighed, &quot;Mianko Aino IS Sailor V. And Raye Hino IS Sailor Mars!&quot; 

&quot;Not anymore,&quot; Raye raised her voice. She paused to regain her composure, &quot;Sailor Mars can 
be in love with Venus. Raye can be in love with Mina. But Raye can&#39;t be in love with Sailor 
V.&quot; 

Mina looked at her confused, &quot;What the hell are you talking about?&quot; 

Lita, Serena, Luna, Artemis and Amy entered the room. &quot;What are you two yelling about this 
time?&quot; Lita asked. 

Raye and Mina looked each other in the eyes one last time. Mina slowly went back to sit on 
the couch. &quot;Nevermind,&quot; Raye said to Lita. 

&quot;Hey Mina,&quot; Serena smiled, &quot;Let&#39;s go, it&#39;s time for pizza!&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m not going,&quot; Mina said pricking her fingers. 

&quot;Aw come on Mina,&quot; Lita laughed, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, it&#39;s not a big-&quot; 

Raye grabbed Lita&#39;s hand, &quot;Don&#39;t, don&#39;t bother her.&quot; 

There was a long pause. The girls noticed a tear run down Mina&#39;s eye. 

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Amy asked 

&quot;I&#39;ll explain later,&quot; Raye said. She locked elbows with Lita, &quot;You wanna be my date for 
tonight Lita?&quot; 

&quot;Uh,&quot; Lita stuttered, &quot;I guess.&quot; 

Mina felt betrayed seeing her ex-girlfriend take Lita by the hand. Raye began to lead them 
all out the door. Artemis was sad to see Mina so unhappy. He walked over towards her and 
jumped on the couch, &quot;You want me to stick around Mina?&quot; 

Mina wiped the tear off her face, &quot;No, thank you Artemis.&quot; 

&quot;You sure?&quot; The white cat responded. 

Mina shook her head. 

Artemis walked back as Raye opened the door. &quot;Can we hurry it up already?&quot; Serena whined. 

Amy stood there staring at the girl who she had saved earlier at the reservoir. She 
couldn&#39;t help but think about how the two of them made out in celebration of their victory. 

&quot;Hello?!&quot; Serena said waving her hand in front the blue-haried scout, &quot;Earth to Amy?&quot; 

Amy finally looked to everyone, &quot;Um, why don&#39;t you all go without me. I think I&#39;m just 
gonna stay here and study.&quot; 

&quot;Oh come on Amy,&quot; Serena whined and put her arms around her, &quot;This is our date-night!&quot; 
Serena gave her blue-haired girlfriend a kiss. 

&quot;You go ahead Serena,&quot; Amy smiled, &quot;We can go out tomorrow.&quot; 

Serena moaned annoyingly, &quot;Well this sucks. I don&#39;t have a date!&quot; 

&quot;Luna will be your date!&quot; Lita mocked. 

&quot;But,&quot; Serena said as they walked out the door, &quot;Luna&#39;s a cat!&quot; 

&quot;Hey!&quot; Luna complained as the door closed. 
 
 

With the exception of one lone lamp at the end of the couch, the room was filled with 
darkness. Mina sat there more conflicted than Hamlet. Footsteps echoed louder than bullets 
as Amy sat herself right next to the blonde. Her sadness reflected off of Amy&#39;s eyes. She 
grabbed Mina&#39;s hand. 

&quot;What happened?&quot; She said in the most innocent beautiful voice. 

Another tear rolled down Mina&#39;s face. She wouldn&#39;t answer. 

&quot;Please Mina,&quot; Amy&#39;s soothing voice echoed as she raised their clasped hands. 

Tears began to fall more as Mina turned around to face her friend: &quot;Raye and I,&quot; she 
hesitated, &quot;Just broke up.&quot; 

A silent gasp overtook Amy&#39;s face, &quot;Oh no! Mina I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Amy embraced her friend. Mina 
returned the affection. She could hear from the sound of the blonde&#39;s breath that she was 
holding back tears with closed eyes. Amy too closed her eyes getting caught in the heat of 
the emotional moment. &quot;I&#39;m always here for you. You know that.&quot; 

&quot;I know Amy,&quot; Mina kissed her on the lips. &quot;You saved my life today, you&#39;ve always been 
there for me.&quot; She let go of Amy and hung her head low. &quot;But Raye&#39;s been there for me too. 
What&#39;s happened to us?&quot; 

Amy, always a conscious thinker, pondered the most comforting words to say: &quot;Maybe this 
isn&#39;t the end for you two,&quot; she said, &quot;You could let her know that you&#39;ll be putting Sailor 
V behind you-&quot; 

&quot;I can&#39;t do that Amy,&quot; Mina looked into her eyes, &quot;I&#39;m not ready to leave that life behind. 
Raye&#39;s so much more disciplined than I am.&quot; 

Amy lowered her head, &quot;I know.&quot; She hesitated, &quot;I&#39;m not either.&quot; 

Mina was slightly surprised to hear this, &quot;You Amy? But you&#39;re the most disciplined out of 
all of us.&quot; 

&quot;Not enough to stop being a Sailor Scout.&quot; 

&quot;And Serena,&quot; Mina asked, &quot;Don&#39;t you want to spend more time with Serena?&quot; 

Amy sighed and held both of Mina&#39;s hands, &quot;Sailor Mercury&#39;s heart will always belong to 
Sailor Moon&#39;s, but both of them have dropped off the face of the Earth. When Luna told us 
we couldn&#39;t be Sailor Scouts anymore, it broke my heart. But seeing you, the only one of us 
who refused to give up your desire to fight, gave me new life. I could have easily stopped 
you this morning-&quot; A smile came across Amy&#39;s face, &quot;It is possible to stop Sailor V! But 
instead, I transformed into Sailor Mercury, put my goggles on for disguise, and became 
Sailor A.&quot; 

&quot;Mina,&quot; Amy leaned in closer to her friend, &quot;I don&#39;t care what the others say. We CAN 
ensure Serena&#39;s protection and fight evil. So long as you choose to be Sailor V, Sailor A 
will fight with you!&quot; 

Tears began to fall off of Mina&#39;s face more, &quot;Oh Amy!&quot; The two of them embraced in passion. 
Their lips pressed hard against each other. Mina began to caress the blue-hair&#39;s body, 
moving down to kiss her neck. Amy&#39;s head jerked back as she closed her eyes and moaned in 
pleasure. Mina&#39;s hands moved farther down Sailor Mercury&#39;s body. She rubbed her hands along 
the jean-layered thighs of her lover. Amy shook her head slightly and moved in to kiss the 
blonde again. Her hands reached up into Mina&#39;s shirt to feel her soft skin. Amy&#39;s cold 
hands send a slight chill up her spine. Tonight was going to be a night of romantic passion 
and blissful pleasure. 

With a click flick of the wrist, Mina turned off the lamp.
