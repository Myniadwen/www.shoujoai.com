&quot;Kissing Cousins &#150; Why Making Haruka and Michiru Relatives

Doesn&#39;t Conceal their Relationship&quot;

Steel

Michiru carefully bends down to correct the selvage of her dress &#150; the 
delicate silver lace edging tending to get stuck on the buckle of her 
sandals &#150; before straightening up, brushing some invisible dust of her 
shoulder and knocking three times on the door before her, politely 
waiting for someone to verbally consent to her entrance.

The corridor she is standing in is bustling with students hurrying back 
and forth between classrooms, the sound of the orchestra practicing for 
next week&#39;s performance leaking out as the door to the assembly hall 
falls shut behind first a tall, redheaded girl and then a young black 
boy. Among the hundred of different sounds, Michiru can clearly make out 
the fragile tune of a harp. The melody floating underneath the gentle 
notes is one of her own compositions. &quot;Shojo no Koi&quot; &#150; the love of a 
maiden; an ensemble of harp, violin and piano.

Turning her head in the direction of the ceremonial hall fully, she is 
able to catch on to the refrain of the violin as well. The unknown 
artiste plays it a little more softly than she would have herself, but 
Michiru quite likes the outcome anyway. She clearly remembers arranging 
this particular piece of music; back when she was still watching Haruka 
trying to outrun her destiny from afar. Note after note weaving together 
as she had let her bow caress the violin strings freely &#150; a musical 
replication of how she wanted to touch the tomboyish girl who had begun 
invading her dreams of the Kingdom they had once been part of...

As a sleek, male voice calls out to her from inside the office, however, 
the college hosting the concert that has brought Michiru to the capital 
of the United States of America seemingly falls silent; the song of her 
heart &#150; played by anonymous musicians further down the hallway &#150; 
drowning in the harsh command.

&quot;Enter!&quot;

Reaching into the pocket of her white cardigan to make sure that she 
still has the leaflet with her, Michiru turns her attention back to the 
problem ahead, mentally bidding the beautiful music goodbye... for now. 
There is no music traceable in the voice she just heard, and &#150; even 
without the foreboding roar of waves in her mind &#150; the twinge of dislike 
she feels would have been enough of a warning. People without music in 
them are rare, but the few examples of such individuals Michiru has 
actually met in her life have never been very pleasant.

&quot;Ah, Miss Kaioh&quot; she is greeted as she steps into the large, dark room, 
closing the door silently after herself. At the desk in front of a long 
row of small windows, all with the curtains drawn to keep out the light 
of noon, a bulky man is sitting with a phone in one hand and a stack of 
papers in the other. Clad in a grey suit and a black tie, he is all 
business, even the phrase &quot;what a pleasant surprise&quot; that follows his 
initial welcome sounding as if she is only another pay check.

Perhaps I am, Michiru thinks &#150; nevertheless smiling graciously in 
acknowledgement of his compliment. Civility is a universal factor when 
it comes to human interaction, and Michiru is a master at it. She 
discovered early on that it&#39;s the easiest way to keep foes at an arm&#39;s 
length and friends close in spirit.

&quot;Reynolds-sensei,&quot; she replies respectfully, bowing to him in the 
customary Japanese manner. Out the corner of her eye, Michiru sees a 
small smirk grace the man&#39;s lips at this gesture; something that only 
increases her original distaste of him. When Michiru called her sponsor 
about the matter that has led her to the organizer of the upcoming 
concert, Inari-san had cautioned her to remember that Luke Reynolds is 
infamous for his lack of acceptance for opinions and traditions 
conflicting with his own.

With an attitude like that, though; Michiru imagines that advice 
shouldn&#39;t be too hard to bear in mind.

&quot;Have you had a pleasant stay in America thus far, Michiru,&quot; Luke-san 
beckons to the uncomfortable-looking chair closest to her, lightening a 
cigar as she sits down wordlessly, his cat-like green eyes studying her 
every movement almost as if she were an unusual animal in a zoo, &quot;&#150; you 
don&#39;t mind me calling you Michiru, do you?&quot;

A ring of smoke emphasizes the rhetorical quality of the question, 
because yes, Michiru does mind, but she knows just as well as him that 
it doesn&#39;t matter. He believes he has the right to call her exactly what 
he wants to, and she will not waste her energy on such a trivial battle.

&quot;It has been very interesting,&quot; she answers, letting the mask of 
courteousness slip onto her face by instinct; its sweet, calm appearance 
the only defence she can let him sense at this point. Sarcasm will have 
to wait since secret weapons are most lethal with the element of 
surprise, and she is going to make use of that advantage later. After 
all, Michiru has not been living as a Senshi for the past two years 
without learning a thing or two about warfare.

&quot;I especially enjoy your vast selection of museums,&quot; she adds after 
having looked around the room for something &#150; anything &#150; they could have 
in common, gaze coming to a halt on a beautiful copy of one of her 
favourite Rembrandt paintings.

&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; Reynolds-sensei doesn&#39;t look up at her, too busy 
filing through a stack of papers, the phone that he has abandoned on top 
of a tower of books ringing without him bothering to answer it. Folding 
her hands neatly in her lap, Michiru watches him while he works; the 
small smile positively glued to her lips, but her eyes slightly 
narrowed. Around him is an air of nonchalance; he is a man so sure of 
himself that he thinks himself immortal &#150; untouchable by other human 
beings. His kind is the most dangerous in combat, she knows. They attack 
with great force and without strategy; killing simply because they can.

With a long-suffering sigh Luke-san turns his attention back to her, her 
stillness apparently making him realise that she is not about to go away 
if he ignores the unwritten rules of pleasantries.

&quot;And Miss Tenoh has enjoyed herself as well?&quot; The enquiry is forced, and 
Michiru can tell by the way the corner of his mouth twitches that he is 
asking merely out of convention. Granting him a polite nod of her head 
in return for his effort, she leans forward, feet elegantly crossed at 
the ankles. This is her game of choice... small-talk. In this aspect 
Michiru is so very much like the ocean she represents when in her Senshi 
form; hiding an enormous potency beneath a &#150; at first sight &#150; still 
surface.

&quot;She has been here before to race,&quot; she comments, thoughts straying to 
Haruka&#39;s entertaining little remarks about this place and another that 
she visited with her team mates back when she was still the star child 
of the Japanese national junior racing team and had been invited to a 
friendly in a town just outside Washington D.C.

&quot;Yes, I&#39;d heard she is quite talented behind a steering wheel...&quot;

The tone of Reynolds-sensei&#39;s voice is enough to inform Michiru that she 
has made a fatal mistake in letting her guard down, even for those two, 
short seconds she was inattentive. His voice is an unmistakable 
foreboding; silky and smooth like the revolting threads sea cucumbers 
produce. Oh, how Michiru hates sea cucumbers; she has never been able to 
stand them &#150; they both frighten and disgust her.

Blinking as to shake herself out of the lovely, but treacherous 
daydreams of Haruka, she observes the impressive-looking man as he gets 
to his feet and walks to one of the bookshelves adorning the otherwise 
bleak walls. Caressed by the shadows of the room, his white hair adopts 
an almost lavender shine, bordering on violet.

Cigar still in hand, he picks out a random book, studying the cover, 
although Michiru can tell that he isn&#39;t focused on reading the &#150; to her 
&#150; exotic letters of the English alphabet, but rather on the words 
forming in his mind.

&quot;You&#39;re quite a pair, aren&#39;t you?&quot; he muses out loud, Michiru feeling 
the muscles in her jaw straining from the way her refined smile grows 
unnatural and strained. The realisation that he has known all along why 
she has come to his office shouldn&#39;t surprise her as much as it does, 
really, but it is not often she has met people like him; people with so 
smudgy auras that she can hardly tell the colours of it apart.

The scarcity of such an occurrence is, nonetheless, no excuse.

&quot;One of you a world-renowned violinist and nationally acknowledged 
painter, the other a top race-car driver and capable pianist,&quot; Luke-san 
turns around to face her again, the grimace that she supposes should 
resemble an appraising grin looking more like a disdainful leer, &quot;not 
every day two so talented girls get to share the spotlight...&quot;

He won&#39;t say the words. Like a vulture in the desert, circling above the 
thirsting camel, she thinks. Not willing to go for a direct hit before 
someone else has killed his target for him.

&quot;Hai, about that...&quot; she says softly, making sure her tone doesn&#39;t 
betray the approaching attack, brushing a lock of curly, aqua hair away 
from her face while lowering her gaze to give him a false impression of 
mildness, &quot;I believe there has been a mistake, Reynolds-sensei.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; He raises both eyebrows in mock surprise. Giving him a look out 
the corner of her eye, Michiru wonders for a moment if he knows that she 
has seen right through his little act... and if that revelation is 
mutual, because she is trained in looking past pretending &#150; but is he? 
Does he think her as harmless as she tries to convince him that she is?

For the first time since she sat down in the horrible, black leather 
chair whose back pains her spinal column to an extent she suspects is 
intentional, Michiru moves, reaching into her pocket for the booklet 
Haruka and she received the previous night about the concert she will be 
participating in come Friday. Holding it out for Luke-sensei to take, 
she raises her chin to let her own gaze meet his forest-green eyes, 
searching for some hint of him having rumbled her costume of innocence.

She finds none.

&quot;Your catalogue,&quot; Michiru begins, waving the pamphlet to indicate what 
she&#39;s talking about, but Reynolds-san doesn&#39;t make any indication as to 
take it, instead simply staring at her with his unnerving eyes ripped of 
any kind of melodious harmony, making her think of two black holes in 
the galaxy of an emotionless face. Raising an eyebrow, she silently 
places the leaflet on the tabletop among newspapers and important 
letters. &quot;It claims Haruka and I to be cousins. We&#39;re not. We are...&quot;

The expression on his face changes in a matter of seconds from a blank, 
slightly disinterested look to one of smug victory. The responding break 
of the tides within her is so overwhelming that Michiru has to wring her 
hands tightly together as not to grab hold of her transformation pen and 
call to the ocean for help. She feels her eyes widen, but wills her mask 
of civility not to slip, her lips pressed together in a thin line as she 
remains seated &#150; muscles trembling from the effort not to get to her 
feet.

&quot;You&#39;re lovers, yes. So we found out after you&#39;d accepted our request of 
bringing your &#145;partner&#39; at the performance.&quot; His words fall in a slow 
drizzle like fog misting up as it comes in contact with warm skin. She 
shudders. &quot;Very clever, young lady, not to inform us your partner was 
also a woman.&quot;

Smiling &#150; a sharp, contrasting line of displeasure stretching along her 
carefully glossed lower lip &#150; Michiru lets her gaze wander from the 
organizer who has (at last) put the book away in order to examine her 
for any kind of effect to the brochure on the table, it&#39;s its pink 
lettering announcing &quot;Michiru Kaioh and her cousin Haruka Tenoh (Tokyo, 
Japan) in a loving duet &quot; as one of the main events of the Valentine&#39;s 
Message Concert.

She knows by now that he doesn&#39;t find her harmless at all &#150; but the 
danger he sees in her has nothing to do with any kind of power she might 
possess but is based solely on... on...

Uncrossing her ankles, she blinks twice before asking the question that 
she already knows the answer to, because it&#39;s the very reason she has 
engaged in this conversation in the first place, but her frankness will 
probably provoke someone like him more than anything else... Michiru 
rather likes that thought.

&quot;Ara, is that a problem?&quot; Her tone is sweet &#150; innocent &#150; but underneath 
lies the taunt, emphasized by the way she cocks her head and looks 
straight at him, blue eyes twinkling. It&#39;s about time she lets Luke-san 
catch a glimpse of her true defence. Sarcasm.

After all, Kaioh Michiru is not as vulnerable as one may falsely assume 
her to be at first sight.

Snorting, Reynolds-sensei walks to his desk, putting out his cigar in 
the expensive-looking crystal ashtray before leaning in, his enormous 
hands sprawled out atop paperwork and the offending booklet Michiru has 
brought with her. The smoke from the cigar moves like curling snakes 
through the air, dissolving little by little.

The silent war between them has just been confirmed, she senses &#150; and 
finally acknowledged by both parties.

&quot;Miss Kaioh,&quot; Luke-san says, his voice taking on the monotonousness of 
official declarations from the loudspeakers on a train station, ready to 
ship her off &#150; except that the formal way he chooses to address her is a 
small victory on its own, &quot;you must understand that this concert is a 
national show aimed at families all over the country &#150; families with 
children.&quot;

Pursing her lips, Michiru gracefully crosses her legs and leans back in 
the chair again. &quot;Are you saying Haruka and I aren&#39;t fitted for the 
drawing room?&quot; she asks, half jokingly, not expecting any reply because 
she is well aware that it is exactly what he is insinuating. As 
predicted, Luke-san&#39;s unreadable face is the only response she receives, 
so Michiru allows her amusement to show in a small giggle, hand raised 
to her mouth to stifle it. Respectfully.

&quot;What precisely do you expect us to be doing on stage except playing our 
music, Reynolds-sensei?&quot; The laughter in her voice she doesn&#39;t try to 
hide.

Still, with this query she gives him the benefit of doubt. Despite the 
fact that Michiru feels a certain aversion towards Luke Reynolds, she is 
unwilling to believe that he is foolish enough to truly represent an 
opinion as irrational as the one he&#39;s just voiced.

Meeting his dark, impenitent gaze with her own softer one, Michiru 
awaits his answer with a silken smile curving on her lips that disguises 
the steel core she will reveal to him if she finds out he really is the 
source of this idiocy. She has never put up with any kind of 
patronization and will not begin tolerating it now &#150; especially not if 
this man is going to stomp on something that is as important to her as 
love. The one thing in this world she would sacrifice everything (her 
own life included) to save.

&quot;That is not the point,&quot; Luke-san answers after a long, pregnant 
silence, turning around to face the row of windows behind the desk. By 
his stance &#150; rigid and self-assured, a dictatorial pride evident in the 
casual way he gesticulates with his hand &#150; Michiru can tell that she 
isn&#39;t supposed to ask what the point is then. &quot;If people are informed of 
Miss Tenoh&#39;s and your affair...&quot; he says; Michiru watching the movement 
of the muscles in his jaw as he trails off once more. Suddenly he draws 
back one of the curtains, the late afternoon sunlight falling in a thick 
stripe over the floor, springing up the table and spreading over the 
tabletop like flowers blossoming in spring. It blinds her momentarily, 
but Michiru refuses to blink &#150; instead letting her eyes get used to the 
intrusive whiteness.

If he&#39;s trying to throw her off balance, it will take more than petty 
tricks such as this to succeed. Not letting her gaze drop, she gets to 
her feet. He is taller than her, of course, but height has never 
intimidated Michiru &#150; she has learned long ago that being the typical 
Japanese lady in both appearance and stature has its advantages. When 
all comes down to it, strength isn&#39;t measured by build alone. If Haruka 
had been here, she would have had to agree, being the one in the world 
who knows Michiru better than anyone.

&quot;It would naturally bring associations of... more intimate... 
situations...&quot; Reynolds-san carries on, turning on his heel, appearing 
to be nothing but a silhouette against the bright orange light pouring 
in through the window behind him. With his hands behind his back and 
legs slightly apart, he reminds Michiru of a police officer, ready to 
bark out orders.

Startling slightly at his choice of wording, Michiru feels an unbidden 
laughter rise in her chest. It&#39;s not because she hasn&#39;t experienced 
homophobes before &#150; unfortunately Tokyo isn&#39;t a homophobia-free zone &#150; 
but at least in Japan public displays of intimacy is disapproved of no 
matter the sexuality of the couple.

No, this excuse is ridiculous. Plain discrimination. She knows from the 
manuscript she has been given that the couple performing before Haruka 
and she will end their show with a kiss &#150; but apparently no parents will 
object to such antics as long as it is between a man and a woman.

&quot;That&#39;s a little silly, ne?&quot; she responds, the soft look in her eyes 
having disappeared, although her smile (a worldwide symbol of 
politeness) is still firmly in its place. Walking around the table, she 
comes to a halt in front of him, crossing her arms over her chest. She 
doesn&#39;t pose to threaten him &#150; Michiru doesn&#39;t believe in solving 
disagreements through fear &#150; but to corporally show him that she 
declines to be demeaned. If she says no to let him put her down, they 
will enter and leave this argument as equals.

Thinking herself intelligent enough to not find it na&iuml;ve to believe in 
the power of reason, Michiru continues in a practical tone of voice: &quot;I 
hardly think knowing of Vladimir-san and Beatrice-san being romantically 
involved makes people think of them in any &#150;&quot; She throws his own words 
back at him with a small laugh, as if the words in themselves contain 
the sole funniness, her eyes not betraying the uproar of the sea in her 
soul as she mentions the two kissing artists, &quot;intimate situations.&quot;

Refraining to mention that whether it were the two Russian musicians or 
Haruka and herself who were known to be lovers, the music of their 
affection would be alike, Michiru searches for any trace of 
understanding in the colourless eyes examining her. Reynolds-sensei&#39;s 
eyes are as dim as his aura, and Michiru sees no choice but to accept 
the truth of this man. He would never be able to recognise that in the 
moment when two people love each other without demands, that love 
produces a melody &#150; a melody that does not differ significantly 
depending on the factors that the human race tends to put so much 
importance in. Age, colour, religion, gender... No, the music of love 
never changes its rhythm.

One of the main reasons why Michiru would go through fire and water for 
her princess is that Usagi-chan knows this; the nature of love &#150; and 
that knowledge was what enabled her to save the world from chaos.

But the organizer standing before her will never know... will never 
understand... it almost makes Michiru feel sorry for him.

Luke-san&#39;s only reaction is to bow to her in a disgraceful replication 
of the curtsy she showed him upon arriving. &quot;I&#39;m afraid that isn&#39;t the 
point either, Miss Kaioh...&quot;

Almost...

Narrowing her eyes, Michiru replies sharply: &quot;Then I think I have missed 
the point, Reynolds-sensei.&quot; Even now she doesn&#39;t drop the honorific. 
Doing that would &#150; by Michiru&#39;s standards &#150; mean that she were trying to 
disgrace him in the same way he is apparently doing his best to 
humiliate her. To Michiru such behaviour would be unacceptable; it would 
eliminate her idea of fairness. She is not about to sink to his level.

In the end, the waves of the ocean don&#39;t attack by ripping apart and 
cutting open. Her element attacks by stealing away its opponent&#39;s 
breath, leaving him with no other options than to give in to the power 
of the deep waters.

&quot;I came here under the impression that I was going to play an ensemble 
with my partner...&quot;

As Michiru tells him this she takes a couple of steps forward to draw 
back the remaining curtains, letting the daylight outside finally 
conquer the shadows of the room, the displeasure at this move on her 
part not passing unnoticed over Luke-san&#39;s face. She has vented into his 
territory; unbidden and &#150; in his opinion &#150; unworthy. By the way he 
wrinkles his nose at her, she concludes that he doesn&#39;t share her 
intention of viewing the opponent as his equal. Not that it surprises 
her; Michiru has an inkling that he is used to being obeyed and 
perceived as the highest power at this school. With her comment &#150; even 
though it doesn&#39;t bear any sign of reprimand or scolding; she is simply 
reminding him of the reason she came to Washington D.C. to play in his 
Valentine&#39;s concert &#150; she challenges his view of himself. The view his 
surroundings have of him.

Nevertheless, seeing that Reynolds-san is not going to listen to 
emotions or reason, Michiru must speak in a tongue he understands. The 
language of business &#150; and having played the violin professionally since 
age 9, she knows the vocabulary of his world very well. Inari-san would 
have set up conditions; conditions that he is most likely breaking with 
this cousin nonsense.

After having freed the last window in the row of its dark red, 
theatre-like curtain, Michiru turns around to face him again. Correcting 
her cardigan and subtly re-adjusting the edging of her dress &#150; once more 
immaculate in appearance &#150; she pushes some stray tresses of her 
aquamarine hair over her right shoulder and meets his cold smirk with a 
soft look of her own as counter-attack. At this point, she is not 
directly aggressive; instead she is awaiting his next move.

&quot;Technically you are playing with your partner...&quot; Luke-sensei says 
gloatingly, his voice smooth and loaded with a feel of triumph &#150; as if 
this little word-bending loophole of his is the final blow in their 
battle of arguments.

&quot;It is a Valentine&#39;s concert; that theme wouldn&#39;t be disturbed by two 
cousins suddenly appearing on stage to perform together?&quot; Looking at him 
curiously, she lets the three full stops at the end of his sentence hang 
in the air between them; ignored and unanswered. Her question is 
perfectly logical. She knows for a fact that all the artists involved 
were politely requested to bring their partners with them as a part of 
their performance. Most probably, the guests are aware of this as well &#150; 
if stated to be relatives, Haruka and she will fall outside the circle.

Reynolds-sensei has the nerve to laugh at her. Feeling the roar of her 
inner waves almost physically but deciding not to react on the uproar of 
the sea just yet, she raises an eyebrow at him and keeps silent, knowing 
that he will find her porcelain-like features and cool calmness 
unnerving. If there&#39;s something Michiru hates it is being coddled like 
this. Does he really think her so pathetic that he believes she can&#39;t 
handle a little laughter?

&quot;An idealist such as yourself, Michiru...&quot; Luke-san advances at her, the 
sound of his footsteps swallowed up by the thick, Persian rug making up 
a small isle underneath the desk. His white hair shines like copper in 
the afternoon sun as he places one, big paw of a hand on her shoulder in 
a simulated, fatherly gesture. Not reacting at the way he goes back to 
using her given name, Michiru meets his gaze which is shrewd and always 
calculating, &quot;... should know that the love between cousins is also 
love.&quot;

Coming from him, love sounds like a swearword.

&quot;And the love between two women isn&#39;t?&quot; Michiru asks him softly (icily), 
shrugging his hand off her shoulder and stepping back, fingers following 
the edge of the tabletop, skilfully digging out the brochure on the 
concert from between letters and documents before she sits down. For 
Luke-san&#39;s sake, keeping his distance would be preferable right now. His 
double-standards could very well cause her to experience one of her rare 
slips of self-control.

No answer.

Luke-sensei remains silent, every trace of his mocking leer disappearing 
as she uses his own excuse as ammunition. In his eyes, Michiru can see a 
flame of deep irritation. She is a small stone &#150; only a pebble &#150; in his 
shoe, refusing to go away, no matter how many times he kicks out... and 
with her query she has just ripped a small hole in his sock; his 
justification. Sitting down in his own chair as well, resting his chin 
on his folded hands, he scrutinises her for any sign of surrender. She 
meets his intrusive assault unyieldingly, her smile not faltering.

Michiru will not be the first to fall.

Clearing his throat, Reynolds-san breaks their eye contact, finding a 
ballpoint pen in the disorder on his table and clicking it impatiently. 
&quot;Letting you perform as an openly lesbian couple at a school like this &#150; 
the very symbol of our future &#150; would be unheard of, so I&#39;m afraid we 
have limited opportunities of changing it...&quot; Once again his voice is 
droning and disinterested, stating facts he is reluctant to change, 
because he thinks he&#39;s in his good right to let reality stay that way. 
It is a clear-cut dismissal, but Michiru will not accept being dismissed 
so easily.

&quot;What would it take &#150; to change it?&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; he says, a glimpse of future victory showing in his dark eyes, &quot;I 
see you&#39;re not as stubborn as I&#39;d thought, Miss Kaioh.&quot;

Michiru ignores the ill-disguised insult, not needing his approval in 
any way. Instead of reacting by verbally attacking, she cocks her head 
in anticipation. He may think that she will grab any opportunity he is 
offering, but she will have it her way or none at all. Haruka has dubbed 
this side of Michiru her &quot;feminine pride and female strength&quot;, but she 
knows as well as Michiru does that is has nothing to do with her gender, 
but with her personality. Not until rocks and stones have bent to it, 
does the ocean give in.

The man in front of her has yet to realise that, though. Of course, he 
hasn&#39;t lived with her for the past two years like Haruka has, so if it 
weren&#39;t because she disliked him so greatly, Michiru would be able to 
forgive him for his ignorance.

Confident of her expression not giving away any of her thoughts, Michiru 
shifts elegantly to cross her legs at the ankles, putting the catalogue 
back in her pocket and making sure that her dress won&#39;t wrinkle before 
turning her attention back to Luke-san.

&quot;There are two &#150; to us &#150; acceptable possibilities,&quot; he informs her after 
a short absence of words, tapping his chin with his index finger in mock 
consideration, continuing his proposal with an evil gleam in his eyes: 
&quot;One: Miss Tenoh and you allow us to inform the public that she is a 
man...&quot;

Standing up before really having taken in his words, Michiru feels her 
eyes widen in surprise, answering in Japanese out of sheer bewilderment. 
&quot;Nani? Masaka!&quot; Realising her mistake by the look on Reynolds-sensei&#39;s 
face &#150; haughty and self-satisfied &#150; she shakes her head to get a lock of 
hair out of her eyes and sits down quietly, forcing herself to calm 
down.

&quot;That is out of the question, Reynolds-sensei,&quot; she tells him in a more 
level tone of voice, her despisal evident in her brevity alone. Who does 
he think he is? Changing Haruka&#39;s sex as if she was some kind of prop, 
only important in the moment she is on stage with Michiru...

&quot;Think about it, Miss Kaioh,&quot; Luke-san dares her, &quot;no one will be able 
to tell the difference.&quot; He clicks his ballpoint. &quot;As far as I&#39;ve been 
told, Miss Tenoh does make it a point to cross-dress &#150;&quot; click &quot;and I&#39;ve 
heard she sometimes deliberately &#150;&quot; click &quot;misleads people &#150; girls 
especially &#150; into believing she is male...&quot; click.

Every statement is dripping with scorn, and Michiru feels the waves 
inside her finally breaking against the shore, roaring in an 
uncontrolled rage.

Kaioh Michiru is a patient woman. She is not easily angered and does not 
react on impulse unless it concerns people for whom she deeply cares; 
she isn&#39;t bothered much by what people think of her &#150; which is probably 
good, seeing that many consider her cold and snobby &#150; but there is one 
thing she will not stand for. No one shall ridicule Haruka to her face, 
because Tenoh Haruka is the strongest person Michiru has ever met. 
Haruka has sacrificed everything in order to stay loyal to herself and 
her beliefs. No one, least of all Luke Reynolds, shall look down upon 
that because of something as insignificant as clothing.

Narrowing her eyes until they&#39;re nothing but ocean blue slits, allowing 
the man on the other side of the table to finally see a small flicker of 
the power her alter ego (Sailor Neptune) possesses, Michiru leans 
forward, the civility she has managed to uphold throughout most of the 
conversation fading away, replaced by sharp, steely frustration. Her 
patience has worn thin.

&quot;How Haruka does and doesn&#39;t dress has nothing to do with her wanting to 
be a man,&quot; she says, pronouncing each word as if Reynolds-san is one of 
the children in her art class, needing the explanation fed with a spoon, 
because his understanding of the material he is working with is still at 
a beginner&#39;s stage. Her tone is chilly; detached.

Before her inner eye, Michiru sees Haruka, sprawled on their bed, naked 
and unashamed; confident in her own body as she laughs at something 
Michiru has said. How often has Michiru not observed Haruka&#39;s reflection 
like that in the big mirror in their room, pretending to be absorbed in 
brushing her hair. Haruka doesn&#39;t dress like she does because she is 
unwilling to admit to her gender, but because she hates when her 
surroundings associate her with the stereotypical attributes of the fair 
sex. After all, Michiru&#39;s tomboyish lover is no different when dressed 
as a man than when dressed as a woman &#150; but Michiru knows how she highly 
prefers the way people treat her when they see her as Tenoh Haruka and 
not just the girl, Haruka.

&quot;People believe what is most convenient to them, and Haruka simply 
chooses not to correct them,&quot; Michiru persists, noticing the flash of 
contempt in Luke-san&#39;s eyes as she points out the truth of the people 
who judge Haruka and herself &#150; people like him. &quot;That says more about 
the world than about her, I believe.&quot;

It isn&#39;t Haruka&#39;s fault that the world in general is sexist. It isn&#39;t 
their fault that the opinion Reynolds-sensei is demonstrating has been 
allowed to find expression in the legislation of an entire nation; the 
collective mind of the western world. No, Michiru will not take the 
responsibility in this regard, no matter how much Luke-san is trying to 
force her to do exactly that.

&quot;Such a heroic little speech &#150;&quot; Reynolds-san replies sarcastically, 
Michiru knowing that she has been talking to deaf ears. With a sigh, she 
interrupts his rant before it has even begun.

&quot;She would never claim to be a man and therefore I cannot allow you to 
do it for her, Luke-san.&quot; Closing her eyes for a moment to gain the 
calmness of the sea when the storm has passed, already convinced she 
will not like anything Reynolds-sensei has to say from the point 
onwards, she asks: &quot;What&#39;s the other option?&quot;

Lips pressed together in a thin line, Luke-san lets his eyes roam the 
tabletop, the ballpoint pen lying abandoned on top of a stack of papers. 
Michiru relaxes back into the chair, disregarding the pain in the small 
of her back from the uncomfortable position her body is forced to stay 
in, the back of the chair squashing her spine. With a hard, determined 
expression, the organizer pulls a thin folder from one of the drawers in 
his writing desk, pushing it towards her. Folding her hands atop her 
knees, Michiru looks from the portfolio to Luke-san&#39;s face, waiting for 
him to explain.

&quot;We have a brilliant pianist who graduated with straight As last 
summer,&quot; he flips open the folder, revealing a small picture of a tall, 
handsome youth with hints of Asian features, dark purple hair and a 
beaming grin. The picture fills Michiru with sympathy. This boy 
understands the music of love, she&#39;s sure of it. &quot;Brad Ryo Summers,&quot; 
Luke-san&#39;s voice is filled with a certain pride that Michiru hasn&#39;t 
heard him expressing before, &quot;he&#39;s written his term paper on your 
compositions and would see it as a great honour to accompany you on 
stage.&quot;

Reynolds-sensei raises his gaze to meet hers, watching her as she 
contemplates the picture. Michiru knows what he wants her to do; he 
wants her to accept that they announce some kind of secret romance 
between her and &quot;a fan&quot; &#150; who is very practically a male &#150; and at the 
same time it will give the graduate his debut as a musician. With the 
feelings she detected in Luke-san&#39;s voice, he hosts certain warm opinion 
of this particular pupil...

The fact that the large man in front of her is capable of compassion... 
for this student of his, but not for Haruka or herself...

Lifting her chin defiantly, Michiru shakes her head. The boy who she 
feels an unconscious empathy towards is not going to play a part in this 
game of prejudice any more than Haruka is. She is not interested in 
having Brad Summers play the ensemble she has dedicated to the melody of 
her heart &#150; the melody she originally composed with Haruka in mind. 
Because Haruka might not be a master pianist (she hasn&#39;t devoted her 
life to music in the same way Michiru has), but she has an instinctive 
feel for Michiru&#39;s music like no one else does. Haruka manages to do 
what Michiru has found nobody else able to &#150; she captures the story 
written on the music sheets and expresses the original atmosphere of it. 
That in itself is enough for Michiru to not allow anyone else to 
accompany her when she performs her own pieces.

&quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve quite understood my point, Luke-san,&quot; she says 
quietly, her respectful smile back in play and her eyes shining like 
bottomless ponds in the last, remaining beams of the setting sun. Around 
her the lamps in the office are turned on automatically, one by one &#150; 
the snapping sounds echoing in the stillness following Michiru&#39;s words. 
&quot;I wish to perform with Haruka and no one else...&quot;

&quot;Then you&#39;ll have to stay cousins,&quot; Reynolds-san dismisses her, the 
sharp note of his announcement telling her that he is tired of this game 
&#150; this battle of words. Getting to her feet, Michiru draws her cardigan 
closer around her shoulders. Luke-san stands up as well.

&quot;I do hope you will still stay for the concert,&quot; he says without 
enthusiasm, looking bored. He doesn&#39;t care whether she stays or not, 
Michiru is certain &#150; it&#39;s all a question of money and that he has enough 
of as it is. She will only be an absent pay check and perhaps one 
problem less.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;ll play at your concert, Reynolds-sensei,&quot; Michiru responds 
coolly, squaring her shoulders and straightening up; at her full height 
she only has to move up her gaze a little to meet his eyes directly, 
&quot;but only because I respect Inari-san for her effort in getting me this 
engagement.&quot; Stepping back and bowing to him once more in the way she 
has been raised to view as the standard greeting, she turns around, 
heading for the door. If he believes she is the losing party, he is 
wrong. Michiru just didn&#39;t win this round.

&quot;Do you expect me to apologize?&quot; The question &#150; asked in a brusque, 
self-assured manner &#150; makes her stop in front of the door. Turning 
around, she smiles softly, her eyes softening until they are the same 
colour as the small innocent waves nibbling at the beach on a warm 
summer&#39;s day.

&quot;I could ask you the same thing,&quot; Michiru answers gently, without any 
traces of the shame it is so obvious that he wants her to feel.

For a split-second, Reynolds-san looks astonished; taken back by her 
mild attitude. Bowing once more, she exits just as wordlessly as she 
entered through the door to the hallway which has now been overtaken by 
the peace of curfew. He makes no attempt to prevent her from leaving; 
probably believing that her departure means she has accepted her 
shortcoming regarding this topic.

She hasn&#39;t. Why should she? No, Michiru hasn&#39;t lost yet, because not 
winning does not equal being defeated &#150; only giving up does. That is the 
most important rule in war.</pre>
