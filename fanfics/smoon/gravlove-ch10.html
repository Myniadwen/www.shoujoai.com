<h1>Gravity of Love (part 10 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blue.html">BluestAngelDust</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/gravlove-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Haruka nodded at Serena and Rei as they looked towards the bar. She slid 
another drink to one of her regulars, reflecting with both amusement and 
surprise on how she now considered the long-haired blonde a regular at 
her bar. A girl like Serena Tsukino, a regular at her black market 
little club, now there&#39;s the shock of a lifetime.

In the past two weeks, the kidnapped woman had been to her fine 
establishment some 8 times. It was the only place Rei dared to bring her 
to, knowing none of the patrons, though some of them were literally the 
scum of the earth, would dare tell anyone. Not only was The Raven&#39;s 
reputation legendary, but so was her temper. Not to mention no one 
wanted to get on the wrong side of Haruka Tenoh. Especially not by doing 
something like ratting on one of her best friends in her own club.

In her musings, she hadn&#39;t noticed that the pair had reached her crowded 
bar. She snapped out of it in time to see Rei tap on of the men on the 
shoulder. He turned, teeth bared and ready to break some bones until he 
saw who it was. Then, like a pup, tucked his tail between his legs and 
scrambled off the stool he occupied, head down.

Haruka laughed as Serena slid easily onto the recently vacated chair, 
grinning from ear to ear. The owner of Abyss signaled to the other two 
bartenders to mind the customers while she turned her attention to two 
very special guests.

&quot;What&#39;ll it be, ladies?&quot;

Rei smiled and leaned over, pressing against her housemate&#39;s back. A 
blush rose on the cheeks of the seated blonde, making Haruka smile.

&quot;What do you want, Serena?&quot;

The assassin&#39;s husky whisper sent shivers down the woman&#39;s spine. She 
looked over her shoulder and into the lavender eyes twinkling with good 
humor.

&quot;Whatever you&#39;re having?&quot;

Rei smirked and looked at Haruka.

&quot;Gin and tonic.&quot;

Serena gulped, having a flashback to the last time she&#39;d had hard 
liquor. It wasn&#39;t a pretty sight, to say the least.

&quot;And the lady will have a beer.&quot;

The tall blonde chuckled softly at the relieved look on Serena&#39;s face 
and the gleam of satisfaction in Rei&#39;s eyes. She nodded and walked off 
to grab a beer- the kind she knew Serena liked, a light beer.

The seated blonde relaxed, the stool she sat on trembling every once in 
a while from the speakers. She wasn&#39;t the type to party or club all the 
time, but she&#39;ll admit that she loved to do so once in a while. It was a 
great way to unwind, to forget everything that was bugging her.

Sometimes, she&#39;d be in the company of her cousin. But she always felt 
like a tag along with Minako, not that the star would make her feel that 
way- far from it. Still, she preferred to go with her friends from 
school when she went out on the town.

But right now, she was feeling the call of the music. It was beckoning 
her, enticing her with promises of sweet oblivion, of forgetfulness.

Rei smiled when she saw her house guest move on the stool unconsciously. 
She wanted to take the girl onto the dance floor, but wasn&#39;t sure if 
this kind of scene suited her companion.

&quot;Makoto and Ami just got here,&quot; Haruka said, shouting slightly to be 
heard over the music. &quot;Why don&#39;t you two head upstairs? I&#39;ll go up with 
you.&quot;

Rei took one look at Serena and knew she was all too happy to obey. She 
waited for the blonde to stand before placing a hand on the small of her 
back to guide her through the crowd. Not to mention protect her from any 
stray limbs and drunken assholes. Haruka followed, watching in amusement 
at her friend&#39;s actions but did the same.

Serena bound over to Ami once upstairs, causing the three underworld 
dealers to smile. Her excitement was contagious, as soon the women left 
the blonde and the young doctor to allow them their privacy and to 
pursue talks of the newest weapons.

&quot;How&#39;s everything?&quot;

&quot;Great!&quot;

Serena&#39;s enthusiasm was puzzling to Ami, but it always was. Every time 
the blue-haired woman&#39;s seen her friend, the blonde&#39;s always in a 
terrific mood. If she were vain, she&#39;d believe that it was her presence 
that was enough to chase away the darkness of being held against her 
will.

But Ami was a doctor, a scientist, and logic prevailed in her life. And 
she knew though observation and knowledge of her friend that Serena 
wasn&#39;t as upset as she should be, considering the circumstances. In 
fact, she seems to enjoy Rei&#39;s company. This observation baffled the 
young woman&#39;s logical mind.

The long-haired woman seemed to sense her companion&#39;s confusion and 
brought up the night before, she&#39;d attempted to get Rei to put the 
onions for their burgers. To her shock, the assassin adamantly refused. 
The confusion then turned to merriment as the younger woman stated that 
she had no desire to cry over some &quot;stupid purplish white thing.&quot;

Ami stared at the laughter woman opposite from her, wondering if she&#39;d 
finally lost her mind. The famous assassin, refusing to cut an onion? No 
way. Her disbelief grew as Serena went on with stories about how 
horrible a cook Rei was to her vast movie collection to her being a pack 
rat.

Despite her attempts (poor ones, even she&#39;d admit), Ami couldn&#39;t imagine 
the woman her best friend was describing as The Raven. She didn&#39;t want 
to, to be honest. But she was happy that the blonde chattering away was 
at ease. Perhaps, dare she say it, even happy?

&quot;She really is sweet, even though she tries to hide it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take your word for it, Sere.&quot;

&quot;So, how&#39;re things between you and Makoto?&quot;

The doctor blushed, supping the seltzer water a waiter brought her. She 
found herself pulled into an enthusiastic hug.

&quot;I&#39;m so happy for you, Ami! I can&#39;t believe you never told mea bout her. 
You two are perfect together.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t know how to work it into the conservation.&quot;

Serena smirked, leaning over.

&quot;Something like, &#39;Hey guys, I&#39;ve met someone.&#39; Or, &#39;I&#39;ve got a 
girlfriend.&#39; Maybe even, &#39;Guess who got laid this weekend?&#39;&quot;

&quot;Serena!&quot;

Ami&#39;s blush sent her friend into a round of hysterical laughter. She 
tried glaring at the blonde and appearing indignant. But that didn&#39;t 
work at all. Finally, she sighed and pushed the giggling girl.

&quot;Stop it! Will you behave?&quot;

Serena just smiled. Makoto chose that time to interrupt, offering her 
girlfriend her hand and a charming smile.

&quot;Care to dance beautiful?&quot;

Ami blushed, looking at a laughing Serena. She didn&#39;t want to leave her 
friend alone, but looking at the twinkling green eyes. How could she 
refuse?

&quot;Go on,&quot; the blonde urged with a grin.

&quot;Are you sure?&quot;

&quot;Course I am!&quot;

The young doctor was still hesitant as her girlfriend pulled her to her 
feet and down the stairs toward the dance floor. The blue-eyed college 
student sighed dreamily, watching them as they disappeared. They were 
too sweet for words...

&quot;Here you go.&quot;

Serena looked up as Rei slid into the chair across from her, beer n 
hand. She placed it on the table to replace the bottle her house guest 
had just drained.

&quot;Thanks.&quot;

The assassins shrugged, looking around. Upstairs was very much the VIP 
section of the club. Only a few people earned the right to be up here. 
Business was usually conducted up here by the crust of the underworld. 
Though many respected the trust Haruka showed by letting them up here to 
do so, unless it was a very high profile deal or of great importance, 
that stuff usually took place down in the basement.

&quot;I love this song!&quot;

Serena&#39;s enthusiasm brought Rei out of her inspection. She listened for 
a moment, hearing a pop song with a very fast beat, the kind of song 
that made you want to dance. The blonde across from her started moving 
in her seat.

The assassins saw Haruka give her a look from the corner of her eyes, 
which she understood. She took a look downstairs... not too crowded. Her 
lavender eyes turned back to the woman obviously wanting to dance and 
sigh inwardly.

She stood, motion toward the dance floor with a tilt of her head.

&quot;Come on.&quot;

Serena&#39;s eyes widened at the words. Was Rei serious? She knew she&#39;d been 
motionless too long when a fine brow arched. With a bright smile, she 
jumped to her feet.

The younger woman let her companion walk ahead of her, staying just a 
step behind her. A hand reached out and rested against the small of the 
blonde&#39;s back again, an instinct by now.

Serena was a bit nervous when she saw how dark the dance floor was and 
the writing bodies. Places like these were a little too intense for her 
tastes.

The pressure exerted by Rei&#39;s hand calmed her. She had the taller woman 
with her and would be fine. Rei would protect her. The music put her 
even more at ease as she walked through the crowd, trying to find a good 
place.

The assassin was happy when Serena found a place far enough for the 
speaker so that they wouldn&#39;t be deal by the end of the night. The spot 
wasn&#39;t as crowded as the center of the dance floor, but not secluded 
either. She scanned the area for anyone she&#39;d rather avoid, smiling when 
she found none.

As they walked, Serena began to sway her hips and move her arms. Now at 
a spot that satisfied her, she began to dance. The movement eased her 
subconscious worries and fears. She felt her body buzz from the music 
and atmosphere.

Rei watched as her companion started to dance. The blonde was as 
carefree while dancing as she was doing everything else. She was 
unfettered, happy and relaxed, trying to express to the world how light 
she felt. Music, it would appear, ran in the blood of the family, as did 
the ability to move to music. Both Minako and Serena were wonderful 
dancers, though their styles were different.

With Minako, dancing was as natural as breathing, as was true for all 
great performers. It was an extension of her being, of her ability to 
mystify and awe. For Serena, it was a carelessness that attracted 
attention. An innocence and radiance.

Rei realized she was just watching, standing still when the blonde 
opened her eyes and cocked her head. Flustered, she joined in the mass 
of swaying bodies.

Serena smiled when Rei started to dance. She still remembered the first 
time she&#39;d ever laid eyes on the woman, over a month ago. She was so 
graceful, so confident and moved with the ease and power of a predator, 
which, if you really thought about it, she is.

Like everything about the assassin, there was something... wild about 
the way she danced. Everything she did, ever move contained a rawness, a 
power that oozed off of her with every sway of the hips or turn of the 
head. But you got the feeling that she was restraining herself, holding 
back what she could really do. Like a lioness hunting an easy prey, 
power but controlled.

As more people flooded the dance floor, Serena and Rei were forced to 
dance closer together. They touched periodically- a bump of the hips, a 
brush of a hand or the accidental caress of a stray lock of hair.

Pretty soon, they were dancing with each other as opposed to simply 
dancing together. They slowly became one entity, each adjusting her 
movement to match the other.

A nameless, faceless person from the crowd bumped into Serena, causing 
her to lose her balance and momentarily disturb this synchronization. It 
was regained, however, along with the blonde&#39;s balance when the assassin 
acted quickly, placing a hand on her partner&#39;s hips and the other on her 
shoulder to steady her.

Serena didn&#39;t mind the contact. Rei, whether by conscious or unconscious 
choice, left her hand on the blonde&#39;s hip, removing only the one on her 
shoulder.

After a couple more songs, the younger woman could tell her dance 
partner was tiring. With a simple increase of pressure on Serena&#39;s hip 
she signaled that it was time to rest, at least for a while. The blonde 
complied gladly, sweating and very much in need of something to drink.

This time, Rei didn&#39;t let Serena go first since there was no way she 
could forge a way through the crowd. So, she took a soft hand in hers 
and started to make her way toward the stairs, sometimes being perfectly 
polite and other times giving a few &quot;gentle&quot; nudges.

Serena hadn&#39;t really noticed how crowded it had gotten until someone had 
bumped into her, sending her into Rei. Now, she was a bit nervous. But 
her companion remained close enough to protect her even as the assassin 
carved a path for them.

Rei let Serena step in front of her once they came to the stairs. The 
blonde quickly climbed up to the second floor, eager for something to 
drink a place to sit.

Ami and Makoto were already sitting in the booth that had unofficially 
became the group&#39;s. Serena skipped over while her companion wordlessly 
walked over to the bar to get them something to drink.

&quot;Hey!&quot;

Ami smiled and leaned over. She&#39;d been surprised when she discovered her 
friend and the assassin were dancing in a little corner of the dance 
floor. She had been feeling guilty about abandoning the blonde and told 
her lover she wanted to get back when Makoto pointed the pair out.

The doctor was shocked the two of them were dancing, much less dancing 
together. And so close, too. The first impression she got was that they 
looked like an incredible couple. If Serena went that way and Rei wasn&#39;t 
the ruthless bitch that kidnapped her, of course.

There was something about the way they moved, the way Rei&#39;s hand rested 
on her friend&#39;s hip, protective yet very casual and gentle. And Serena 
seemed to be genuinely enjoying herself, whether it was just the dancing 
or dancing with Rei, she wasn&#39;t sure. But she had a strange feeling it 
was the latter.

&quot;Did you have fun dancing?&quot;

Rei came back with a tray of drinks just in time to hear Makoto&#39;s 
question. She placed a glass of Sprite in front of the blonde, which she 
knew to be Serena&#39;s favorite. She would&#39;ve gotten the woman another 
beer, but she had no desire to deal with a tipsy roommate. She gave 
Makoto another glass of scotch and Ami a martini, which she found out 
the doctor was drinking from Haruka.

Serena sent her a beaming smile before nodding enthusiastically to 
answer the inquiry posed by the brunette lover of her best friend.

&quot;Oh, yeah! I haven&#39;t danced in ages.&quot;

Rei snorted softly, sipping her own soda. She had to drive, after all.

&quot;Then what were you doing last night while we cooked?&quot;

The blonde rolled her eyes, nudging her companion lightly. She had 
decided to make dinner last night. It was nothing special, just fried 
rice and stir-fry. It wasn&#39;t how bad the food looked that drove her 
kidnapper crazy, however, since it was actually delicious. No, it was 
the fact that she had cranked the volume of the radio in the kitchen up 
all the way and danced around like a lunatic.

The raven-haired woman paused and seemed thoughtful.

&quot;Wait, I don&#39;t think that could be called dancing. More like flailing 
like a banshee on crack. So, I suppose you haven&#39;t danced in a while.&quot;

Serena gaped at the woman beside her in outrage before hitting a strong 
arm to repay her for the insult. Makoto chuckled softly, though her 
lover was far less amused by the comment and the fact that the two 
sitting across from her were so comfortable with each other.

&quot;I happen to think Serena dances divinely. I saw her,&quot; the brunette at 
the table said, smiling charmingly at the now blushing blonde. &quot;How 
about you honor me with a dance and get away from this grouch?&quot;

Rei blinked, unprepared for her long time friend&#39;s offer to her 
companion. She could only watch wordlessly as her hostage nodded, 
smiling sweetly.

&quot;Mind letting the lady out?&quot; Makoto asked, arching a brow as the usually 
quick assassin sat still in her seat, effectively trapping her dancing 
partner.

The lavender-eyed woman glared at the smirking brunette, standing. She 
felt her mouth go dry when Serena took the offered hand and the two 
headed downstairs. That left her alone with Ami at the table. Ami, who 
she knew hated her with a passion and was doing her best to will her 
into the embrace of death with her eyes.

She sighed softly and finished her soda. Great.


Mamoru Chiba growled, staring the police commissioner down with his 
sparkling eyes. This man was completely useless! His fianc&eacute;e has been 
missing for over a month, in the clutches of that... that... demon!

&quot;What do you mean, you can&#39;t find her? Minako helped you make a sketch 
of her, for god&#39;s sakes!&quot;

The white-haired man was by no means intimidated by this young pup. He 
had stared death in the face countless times and wasn&#39;t about to the let 
the emotions of a desperate man crack him. He did, however, pity him.

&quot;Mr. Chiba, The Raven&#39;s appearance matches over half of the women in 
Tokyo, much less in Japan itself. I understand your concerns; they are 
very much the same ones the police department has. But we are doing 
everything in our power-&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re obviously not! How else can a single woman evade the police of 
this nation&#39;s capital?&quot;

Mamoru&#39;s jaw clenched, his eyes narrowed. He understood only one thing: 
his beloved was in danger and with a dangerous assassin. He wanted her 
safe and sound back in his arms, where she belonged.

&quot;Mr. Chiba, we are doing everything we can. Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I 
have a meeting to attend.&quot;

The police commissioner watched as the young man opened his mouth to 
speak. He seemed to think better of it and closed it, straightening 
himself. With the practiced control and aloofness of one in the 
spotlight, he smoothed his suit of imaginary wrinkles and slipped out of 
his office without another word.


Makoto and Serena laughed as they walked over to the booth where Ami and 
Rei sat. Their happy moods faded when they sensed how tense the two 
seated women were. A wall had been erected around each of the women, the 
coldness of their manner confusing the blonde.

&quot;Ahh... so what&#39;s up?&quot; She asked, attempting to relieve this tension 
that she disliked.

&quot;Just talking,&quot; Rei answered in a somewhat chipped tone.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Serena asked, looking nervously between her friend and her 
kidnapper.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ami responded, giving her friend a small smile.

Makoto understood that something had happened. Something that she hadn&#39;t 
planned on when she&#39;d left her lover alone with her friend. Whatever it 
was, it increased the distance between Ami and Rei as opposed to 
shrinking it, as she had hoped would happen for both her sake as well as 
Serena&#39;s.

&quot;I think it&#39;s time to leave.&quot;

Rei&#39;s announcement surprised Serena. It was still early, barely after 
midnight. They usually left in another hour or two. But looking at the 
emotionless face of the beautiful assassin, the blonde knew better than 
to object. She nodded silently, clearly dejected.

The younger woman felt a pang of guilt at the dampened mood of her 
roommate, but her pride wouldn&#39;t allow her to do what she wanted: tell 
Serena they could stay for a while longer. So, instead, she stood, 
saying a quick good-bye to Makoto before heading for the stairs.

Serena stared at her silent friend, confused and torn. She leaned over, 
wrapping her arms around the doctor, giving a hug which was promptly 
returned. As she pulled away, Ami held onto her for a split second 
longer.

&quot;Be careful,&quot; she whispered softly to the blonde.

The long-haired woman nodded mutely, not understanding but feeling that 
it wasn&#39;t a good time to reject the soft command. She turned and quickly 
followed Rei.

Makoto turned to her girlfriend, her green eyes showing her confusion 
and mild annoyance.

&quot;What happened?&quot;

Ami simply stood and walked toward the bathroom, completely ignoring 
her. The brunette sighed and sat down, burying her face in her hand. 
This wasn&#39;t going very well, not at all.


Minako Aino took another long drag of her cigarette, ignoring the 
ringing phone. When the answering machine picked up, she heard the 
enraged and concerned voice of her agent, asking her to pick up, knowing 
she was there. She stood, walking over to the phone and ripped the cord 
out of the wall, throwing the now useless piece of plastic and metal 
against the wall.

She closed her blue eyes, wishing for the millionth time that the world 
would just leave her alone with her grief and guilt. She just wanted to 
be by herself and wallow in the darkness that had built up inside of 
her. The darkness that was threatening to swallow her whole, that was 
ravaging her inside out.

She had as good as killed her cousin, one of the only people in the 
world that truly cared for her, loved her. All for a woman she lusted 
after, a woman she just had to have and possess. A woman that saw her 
for the weak, pitiful creature that she was and used her.

The police could keep telling her that it wasn&#39;t her fault, that The 
Raven was a skilled mercenary who had preyed on her. That she didn&#39;t do 
anything wrong except be at the wrong place at the wrong time. That she 
had been wronged.

But she knew that she had been picked because she was weak, not because 
she was just there. She had been picked because she was easily 
manipulated, the idiot that let her libido rip something very important 
from her.

Minako sighed and stared at her dark, empty apartment. All the riches 
and fame she has collected meant nothing now.

&quot;Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but 
in&#39;s own house.&quot;


Done! Sorry for not updating in so long. I&#39;ve had the chapter after this 
worked out for months now, but not this chapter. Took a while to come up 
with something to make it flow.

And the last line above that Minako says is from Hamlet, Prince of 
Denmark by William Shakespeare, spoken by the prince himself in Act III.
