<h1>Love is Blue (part 5 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/madpanda.html">MadPanda</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/loveblue-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>A good night&#39;s sleep was what Makoto needed, and thanks to Minako, she 
got that and then some.  She sat up on the futon and realized she was 
still wearing her clothes from last night.  &quot;At least she didn&#39;t take 
advantage of me,&quot; she joked to herself.  She rose from the futon and 
started her morning routine.

The one thing that wasn&#39;t part of her routine was seeing a flashing 
message light on her phone.  She played it back, hearing the message Ami 
left from the night before.  &quot;Dammit!  I could&#39;ve been there last night 
instead of...I better call her back.&quot; Makoto dialed and waited patiently 
for the ringing to stop.

&quot;Hurro...&quot; Ami&#39;s voice slurred.

&quot;Ami-chan?  Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;Well, for five-thirty in the morning, I&#39;m kinda--Mako-chan?&quot;  Ami 
perked up when she realized who it was on the other end.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Ami-chan.  I didn&#39;t realize what time it was.&quot;  Makoto 
mentally kicked herself.  &quot;I just got your message.  I&#39;m sorry I missed 
your call.  I was asleep.  Mina-chan was over and we were talking 
and...&quot; Makoto paused, thinking it best to leave out the whole 
kissing-and-visions incident for now.  &quot;...And I passed out.  I&#39;m sorry 
for not being there for you, Ami-chan.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Mako-chan,&quot; Ami&#39;s voice was sincere.  &quot;I guess it couldn&#39;t 
be helped, especially when you had to deal with Mina-chan.  I think the 
only two who could keep up with her are Usagi-chan and Rei-chan.&quot;  
Makoto heard Ami&#39;s sleepy laugh, and smiled.  &quot;I hope things went well.&quot;

&quot;They did, Ami-chan.  She was helping me with a problem, and I think I&#39;m 
ready to face it now.  I can&#39;t talk about it over the phone, though.&quot;  
Makoto wondered if she really was ready to take the next step.

&quot;Would you like to talk about it with me later then?&quot;  Ami&#39;s concern 
threw Makoto a little.  She half-expected Ami&#39;s reaction, but then Ami 
herself was the &#39;problem&#39;, and Makoto was starting to lose her nerve.

&quot;I-um, well...&quot; she stammered.

&quot;Listen.  I have to do something with Michiru this afternoon.  We can 
talk afterwards.  Meet me at the Kondo theater at six, and we&#39;ll go have 
dinner together, okay?&quot; Ami&#39;s voice was decisive, as if she sensed 
Makoto&#39;s uncertainty.

&quot;Um...sure.  I&#39;ll be there.  I&#39;ll talk to you later, then.  And 
Ami-chan?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Thank you for understanding.  I...I would have loved to been there with 
you.&quot;  The sentence came out faster than Makoto could reel it in.

&quot;I would have loved to have you here in person.  In a way, you already 
were here., and that made me feel better.  Have a good day, Mako-chan, 
and I&#39;ll talk to you later.&quot;

&quot;You too, Ami-chan.  &#39;Bye.&quot;  Makoto waited for Ami to hang up, then did 
likewise.  &quot;I was already there? What did she mean by that?&quot;

----

&quot;It&#39;s so...big!&quot;  Ami&#39;s eyes marveled at the size of the Kondo theater&#39;s 
stage, a huge water tank with one side open to the audience.  It was 
over three meters high and ten meters across, more than enough room for 
all kinds of performances.  A large clamshell was placed in the middle 
of the tank, and a few performers were already going over their routines 
swimming around the shell.

&quot;Impressive, isn&#39;t it?&quot;  Michiru appeared behind Ami, startling the 
blunette.  &quot;It&#39;s bigger than the old stage, and we&#39;re using 
state-of-the-art materials for the tank and the theater itself.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never seen a tank so large.  This must be special glass to be able 
to withstand the water pressure.  Bulletproof fiberglass...double-paned 
and slightly curved to push against the pressure, right?&quot;

&quot;As usual, your analysis is correct!&quot;  Michiru smiled proudly as Ami 
walked up to feel the glass.  &quot;I&#39;m not surprised you&#39;ve figured it 
out...but don&#39;t tell anyone - we&#39;re still working on the patent for it.  
It can even withstand temperature changes.&quot;

&quot;But why would you need for it to do that?  I&#39;m sure the performers 
would want to use warm water&quot;  Ami thought for a moment before answering 
her own question with another.  &quot;For me?&quot;

&quot;Mmm-hmmm,&quot; Michiru nodded.  &quot;In case you decided to join us.  Being 
that your ability is ice-based, I thought it prudent to prepare in the 
event you were comfortable in colder water than everyone else.&quot;

&quot;But Michiru-san, I&#39;m not sure I could do this.  It&#39;s awesome, don&#39;t get 
me wrong, but it&#39;s kind of scary as well.&quot;

Michiru tried to quiet Ami&#39;s uneasiness.  &quot;Come with me.  We&#39;ll watch 
the final run-through for today, and then I&#39;ll let you take a turn on 
the stage.&quot;  Ami&#39;s eyes widened, but Michiru placed a finger to Ami&#39;s 
lips before she could raise a protest.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, by then, it&#39;ll 
just be us.  You won&#39;t be performing...just giving the tank a 
test-drive, so to speak.&quot;

&quot;Well, in that case, I&#39;ll stay.&quot;  Ami was excited - this was a rare 
opportunity, to do something that, as a child, she thought was 
incredible.  &quot;Where do we start?&quot;

&quot;Just follow me to the Owner&#39;s Box,&quot; Michiru said, pointing to the 
luxury box above the center of the balcony.  &quot;It&#39;s the best seat in the 
house.......other than in the tank, of course!&quot;

Once they got there, Michiru made sure Ami was seated and ready for the 
show.  She then pressed a button on a small console and spoke into the 
microphone.

&quot;Places, everyone.  We&#39;re gonna do one more run, and then call it a 
day.&quot;  Her voice was soft yet authoritative.  Ami glanced at her and 
smiled.  Michiru was multi-talented, a renown classical violinist as 
well as an accomplished painter.  Being able to run something like this 
seemed like a daunting task, but Michiru handled it with her usual grace 
and style.  Michiru turned to Ami and whispered, covering her 
microphone.  &quot;It&#39;s showtime!&quot;

If Ami&#39;s eyes grew any larger, they would have exploded.  Her childhood 
memories of seeing mermaids with her father came back to her, and she 
silently wished he could see what Michiru had done to improve upon the 
shows they used to watch.  The dancers performed beautifully, doing a 
underwater choreography that ended with a three-dimensional version of 
the famous &quot;Birth of Venus&quot; painting, only instead of Venus emerging 
from a shell in the sea foam, she came from a huge thrust of bubbles 
from within the shell, with some of the dancers waving large white 
scarves to mimic the waves.  It was a spectacular sight, matched by 
dramatic music.

As the rehearsal ended, Ami stood and applauded.  Michiru&#39;s once again 
came over the loudspeaker.  &quot;Hey, save some of that for the real 
performance&quot;  The dancers waved to Michiru and swam to the top of the 
tank.

&quot;Amazing!&quot;  It was the only word Ami could come up with.

&quot;If you think that&#39;s something, wait until you see what I have planned 
for you.&quot;  Michiru gently took Ami&#39;s hand and led her through a 
different door than the one they came in.  They passed down a long hall 
and then onto the platform ahead of the tank.

&quot;Are we going in already?&quot; Ami said nervously.  &quot;I didn&#39;t bring a 
swimsuit.&quot;

&quot;No need.  I have many in your size to choose from.  Besides, we&#39;re not 
going in just yet.  There&#39;s some things I want to show you before you 
get in.  Call it a &#39;crash course&#39; if you will.. Michiru took out a CD 
from a stack and placed it in the player.  &quot;First, a little warm-up, 
then I&#39;ll see how you move on land.  After that, we&#39;ll just apply what 
you do out here in there,&quot; she said, waving to the tank

Ami seemed a bit reluctant.  &quot;But what about the others?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ll all be gone long before we&#39;re in the tank.  By that time, it&#39;ll 
just be us.&quot;

&quot;Alright then...shall we begin?&quot;

-----

Makoto sat nervously in her apartment, waiting for the right time to 
leave.  She checked, double-checked and triple-checked her attire for 
the day; a knee-length shoulder-strapped summer dress, green to match 
her eyes and close fitting to hug her generous curves.  It may not have 
been a &#39;date&#39;, but she wanted to look her best for Ami.  Especially 
considering the conversation they were going to have, and the outcome 
she was hoping for.  She got tired of waiting, checked her pony-tailed 
hair in the mirror one last time, and then left her apartment.

She had expected to see the taxi she had called for, but instead found a 
red convertible parked outside her door, and a tall woman with short, 
sandy-blonde hair standing beside it.  &quot;It&#39;s about time, Mako-chan.  
Your chariot awaits.&quot;  The woman did an exaggerated bow and waved toward 
the car..

&quot;Haurka-san??  What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;Waiting for you, silly.&quot;  Haruka smiled and opened the passenger side 
door for Makoto.  &quot;Let&#39;s go.  Time waits for no one.&quot;

&quot;Except Setsuna,&quot; Makoto joked.  &quot;Did Ami-chan send you to pick me up?&quot;

&quot;No, it was Michi&#39;s idea.  She and the little mermaid are fooling around 
at Kondo, and since I have to pick her up there anyway, she thought it 
best for me to swing by and get ya.&quot;

&quot;Thank you both very much,&quot; Makoto said with a bow before taking her 
seat..

Haruka closed the door behind her and jumped into the driver&#39;s seat.  
&quot;Well then.  Shall we go straight there, or take the--ahem--scenic 
route.&quot;  Haruka&#39;s pause punctuated with a sideways leer.

Makoto felt the tall blonde eyes take an unguided tour of her body and 
blushed furiously.  &quot;Um, I...I think we should go straight there.&quot;

&quot;Suit yourself,&quot; Haruka huffed.  &quot;Though that dress has &#39;side trips&#39; 
written all over it.  Y&#39;know, there is this quiet little spot just past 
the--&quot;

&quot;Haruka-san!&quot; Makoto yelled.

&quot;Okay, okay...you Inners are all so cute when you&#39;re flustered.  
Fine...hold on to your undies.--if you&#39;re wearing any, that is.&quot; 
Haruka&#39;s sly grin suddenly turned into a steely-eyed smile as her engine 
revved up.  &quot;Next stop: Kondo!&quot;</pre>
