<h1>A Meeting of Minds (part 8 of 15)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/softrogue.html">SoftRogue</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/amom-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>---Present Time---

&quot;Setsuna-san? Are you alright?&quot; Ami asked with concern, seeing me 
fumble my tea cup.

&quot;Cough, cough. I&#39;m fine, just swallowed the wrong way.&quot; I say; my 
explanation sounding lame to my ears.

Michiru gave me a look of concern before turning her attention to our 
visitor. &quot;Good morning, Ami-chan. Would you like some breakfast?&quot;

&quot;No thank you, Michiru-san.&quot; The blue haired girl replied polite.

&quot;So, what brings you to our humble abode this early in the morning?&quot; 
Haruka asked while sitting back down and motioning for Ami to take a 
seat.

&quot;Well...last night I was talking to Setsuna-san about some articles 
I&#39;ve found that I thought she might find interesting and she invited me 
over so we could talk about them.&quot;

&#39;So eager to learn,&#39; I muse to myself &#39;just like Pai was. She was 
probably up at first light anxious to come see me.&#39;

&quot;Last night...my car...&quot; Haruka muttered as she gave me a dark look.

&quot;Ten&#39;ou Haruka! Not in front of our guest!&quot; Michiru said sharply, 
pointing her spatula like a scepter before collecting our breakfast 
from the stove and joining us at the table.

&quot;...fine, fine...&quot; groused Haruka.

&quot;Oh! I almost forgot! I finished my program last night!&quot; Ami said 
excitedly as she opened a carrying case I just noticed.

&quot;Program?&quot; I asked curiously as she pulled out a laptop and opened it.

&quot;Oh yes. I&#39;ve been working on a way to interface the Mercury Computer 
with my laptop. You see, I had to...&quot; Ami started to explain the 
programming process she went through in a lecturing tone as she booted 
up her laptop and connected it to the Mercury Computer. &quot;Unfortunately, 
many of the files I was able to find are either so technical that I&#39;m 
still trying to understanding them or is so heavily encrypted that it 
could conceivable take months or years before I&#39;ll be able to gain 
access to them. However, I was able to access several pictures that I&#39;m 
sure you&#39;ll find interesting.&quot;

As Ami finished bringing up a file on her computer, my stomach 
tightened in a knot. Had she found some sort of reference about me? Pai 
had carried her Computer with her everywhere long before she had first 
put on her uniform and she was constantly scanning and consulting it. 
Was there some mention about our relationship? Or even some damning 
piece of evidence?

&quot;Now, mind you, you&#39;re the first ones I&#39;ve shown this too.&quot; Ami said, 
somewhat embarrassed, as she turned the laptop around show us the 
screen.

&quot;...snicker...he, he...HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!&quot; Haruka exploded into a fit 
of laughter as Michiru and I smiled slightly.

It was a picture of Princess Serenity and Myung. I&#39;d guess that it had 
been taken several years before Rion had arrived at the Palace. The 
image, captured for all time, showed a red faced Myung, who was clearly 
yelling, holding the princess in a headlock.

&quot;You mean that Rei-chan and Usagi-chan were fighting even back then?&quot; 
Michiru asked, glancing at me.

I nod carefully. They hadn&#39;t always fought; but some things were better 
left unsaid.

&quot;I definitely want to be there when you show them that picture!&quot; Haruka 
laughed.

&quot;Did you have any other picture of any of us back then?&quot; Michiru asked 
curiously.

&quot;Well, some. Not as many as you would think. Most of the images are of 
places that I assume are from around the Moon Kingdom. I didn&#39;t find 
anything with Hotaru-chan or Setsuna-san in them, but...&quot; I resist the 
urge to sigh in relief as Ami turned her laptop around and started 
typing; Pai had always been a private person and I realized that if she 
had any images of the two of us, she would have most likely kept them 
under the heaviest of encryption incase anyone had stumbled across her 
Computer. &quot;Here. Talk a look at this.&quot;

My housemates looked at the laptop and all traces of their mirth 
vanished. Michiru sighed lovingly as she leaned against her blonde 
lover while Haruka wrapped an arm around her; her eyes locked on the 
picture before us.The image was of one of the rare occasions that Kei 
and Yuri had been at the Lunar Palace. They were standing on a balcony, 
wearing their courtly dresses, looking across Mare Serenitatis; holding 
each other tenderly.

&quot;Can we get a copy of that?&quot; Michiru asked softly after a few moments.

Ami nodded and, with practiced precision, made a copy and presented the 
two lovers a diskette. Haruka, Michiru and I started on our breakfast 
while Michiru and Ami made small talk. Once we were finished, Michiru 
declined the younger girls offer to help with the dishes and Ami and I 
moved to the living room, followed by Haruka; who was kicked out of the 
kitchen by her lover.

Haruka turned on the TV to watch some motocross while Ami and took up 
residence at a nearby table. Ami pulled out several magazines and books 
and brought up several files on her computer and soon the two of us 
were engrossed in a discussion of astrophysics. Michiru soon joined us 
in the room and sat in a comfortable armchair and began reading. I 
found myself enjoying spending time with Ami as we talked about the 
why&#39;s and how&#39;s of the universe. It was so similar, yet different, from 
all the times that Pai and I had been ensorcelled in a back corner of 
the Royal Library pouring over various tomes. Slowly, my concerns about 
my feelings began to melt away and I resolved to try to spend more time 
with the young, azure haired girl beside me.

Quite some time passed before the doorbell rang for the second time 
that day. Ami and I were deep in our discussion while Haruka was 
engrossed in her program. I barely noticed as Michiru excused herself 
and headed for the front door. However, I definitely noticed when she 
returned.

&quot;Hi everyone!&quot; an uber-genki voice exclaimed, accompanied by flurry of 
blonde hair and a white cat. &quot;Oh, hi Ami-chan! What are you doing 
here?&quot;

&quot;um...hi, Mina-chan.&quot; Ami said with a slight blush as Minako came over 
and gave her a quick hug.

With a twirl of her hair, Minako moved over to the couch Haruka was 
sitting on and flopped down next to her. &quot;This is boring. What else is 
on?&quot; she asked, before she grabbed the remote and started to flip 
through the channels.

I found it hard to resist chuckling at the blonde Senshi of Loves&#39; 
antics as I recall the first time I saw her.

---Silver Millennium---

Standing quietly behind the drapes hanging on the wall behind the 
Throne in the Crystal Hall, I silent observe as Queen Serenity presides 
over her court. All the Lords and Ladies and minor nobles were present; 
along with the Inner Senshi, the princess, Myung, Rion, and young Pai. 
I had arrived at the Lunar Palace several minutes ago, only to find the 
halls virtually deserted. It had taken me a few moments to learn that 
the Queen had called and Audience, but I was genuinely perplexed as to 
why young Pai and the other two girls were attending since my friend 
deliberately kept them away from Court as much as possible in order to 
prevent them from inadvertently becoming tangled the web of Court 
Politics.

I look at where young Pai is standing beside Myung and Rion next to 
where the princess was seated on her own Throne. At fifteen, she had 
bloomed into a beautiful young woman. As I watch, I can&#39;t help but 
smile as I watch her admonish Myung for the swat she had just given the 
princess. My eyes narrow as I glance at Rion, who is standing entirely 
to close to my Pai for my tastes.

Shaking my head, I move silently to stand behind the Inner Senshi; who 
were situated to one side of the Throne; doing my best to remain 
hidden, and listen quietly as they speak in hushed tones. &quot;This is 
ridiculous.&quot; Nae, the Senshi of Mars, said with a flip of her long red 
hair.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s seems like it will be fun! I&#39;ve heard there&#39;ll be 
cake later!&quot; Airi, the blonde Senshi of Mercury, looked around 
excitedly as she blinks her large blue eyes.

&quot;Please!&quot; Nae groused, &quot;Leave it to the Venusians to make a big 
production of everything. Hell, if we weren&#39;t on such good terms with 
the Terrans right now they would have already attacked; considering all 
the warships that they brought.&quot;

&quot;But aren&#39;t you a Venusian too?&quot; Airi asked perplexed.

&quot;Nope! I was formally adopted as a Martian by their High Court. And it 
couldn&#39;t have happened sooner.&quot;

&quot;With our blessing, since we didn&#39;t want you anymore.&quot; Ruliya, the 
Senshi of Venus, muttered under her breath as she adjusted the harness 
that held the Stone Sword across her back.

&quot;Well, that makes two of us.&quot; Nae replied smugly. &quot;I couldn&#39;t stand 
their stuffy attitudes one second longer.&quot;

&quot;And we couldn&#39;t stand your flippant and condescending behavior 
either.&quot; Ruliya said as she turned her head to look at the redhead, 
causing her silvery curls to bounce.

&quot;Ahem.&quot; Nanami, the Senshi of Jupiter, cleared her throat and stared at 
the two bickering woman through the bangs of her short cropped 
forest-green hair.

Ruliya turned her attention back to the Court, intent of ignoring the 
redhead. Nae, for her part, smirked at her leader before giving Airi a 
wink.

&quot;But you have to admit,&quot; the redhead continued, turning her head look 
at the silver haired woman. &quot;It is exorbitant, even by Venusian 
standards.&quot;

Ruliya tensed slightly before she sighed. &quot;The Princess is beloved by 
the people, even more so that I was. It&#39;s not surprising that my 
brother, the Tsar, would insist on such an extravagant affair for 
presenting the next Senshi of Venus to her Majesty.&quot;

&quot;No...really?&quot; Nae said sarcastically. &quot;Considering that we were all 
&#39;fetched&#39; by the previous Senshi? I think your brother is a little off 
in the head for bucking tradition like this if you ask me. Any one of 
us could have brought her here. Hell, Myung is almost ready to be 
formally named as my successor; she and Pai could have gone to get 
her.&quot;

&quot;Taking in account what happened when Pai went to retrieve Rion, there 
is some wisdom in his actions.&quot; The battle hardened Senshi of Jupiter 
stated.

&quot;Ok, fine. I&#39;ll give you that, Nanami; but to bring the entire Venusian 
Fleet?&quot;

&quot;Come on, let&#39;s just relax and enjoy! It&#39;s not everyday we have a 
chance to get together and get to have fun.&quot; Airi said brightly.

The four women fall silent for a few minutes as they listen to the 
proceedings. Finally, Nae spoke up again. &quot;Speaking about the kids, 
there&#39;s an idea I wanted to run by all of you.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Airi asked as the three woman looked at Nae.

&quot;Yea, I was thinking asking the Queen to enact the Proclamation of 
Tears.&quot;

&quot;The what?&quot; Ruliya asked as she and Rion looked at Nae with confusion.

&quot;&#39;The Proclamation of Tears&#39;.&quot; Airi said automatically, as if reading 
from a law book. &quot;First enacted by Serenity VI fifteen hundred years 
ago. With the death of the then current Senshi of Venus, and with no 
heir to the power of the Senshi of Love present, Serenity VI declared 
that, under no circumstance, should the Inner Senshi be allowed to 
operate without a formally recognized leader. It was her decision to 
allow all of the current Senshi; including Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and 
the then awakened Saturn; to choose a new leader for the Inner Senshi. 
After much deliberation, a unanimous decision was reached that the then 
current Senshi of Jupiter would assume leadership until she passed her 
mantel of power to her successor and, hopefully, the leadership of the 
Inners to the next Senshi of Venus. Fortunately, two and a half decades 
later, another Senshi of Venus was Awakened. Since that time, the 
Proclamation of Tears has been enacted on two separate occasions. The 
first time was during the rein of Serenity XI; due to the death of the 
then Senshi of Venus; thus resulting in the passing of the leadership 
of the Inner Senshi to the then Senshi of Mars. The second time was 
during the rein of Serenity IXX when the then Senshi of Venus was 
stripped of her powers and dismissed on the charges of gross misconduct 
and treason, thus resulting in the leadership of the Inner Senshi being 
passed to the then Senshi of Mercury.&quot;

Nae nodded as Airi finished her recitation and waited patiently. It 
didn&#39;t take long until someone said something. &quot;You want to what!?&quot; 
Ruliya demanded in a harsh whisper.

&quot;Oh, not you Ruliya. You&#39;ve done a decent job of leading us.&quot; Nae said 
in a teasing voice. &quot;I&#39;m talking about them.&quot; She finished with a nod 
towards young Pai and the others.

&quot;Then explain.&quot; Ruliya demanded.

&quot;Look, putting aside my opinions about Venusians, we have an awkward 
situation here. On one hand, there is a large age difference between 
this new girl and the others; I mean she&#39;s 10 while Pai and Rion are 
nearly adults. Then there&#39;s the fact that, for all intents and 
proposes, Myung and Pai are ready to steep into our shoes and Rion 
isn&#39;t too far behind; while it will be years before this new girl will 
be ready. And to top it all off, Pai has already has combat experience; 
something that none of us had until long after any of us became Senshi 
ourselves.&quot;

&quot;You want Pai to be the next leader of the Inner Senshi?&quot; Nanami asked 
harshly.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with that? You have something against her?&quot; Nae asked.

&quot;What? No! Of course not!&quot; Nanami answered.

&quot;No, you don&#39;t. You just feel that Iria has too much influence over 
her, don&#39;t you.&quot; The redhead stated.

Narrowing her eyes dangerously, the short haired woman said. &quot;This has 
nothing to do with Her.&quot;

&quot;Um, guys? Can&#39;t we just get along?&quot; Airi pleaded.

&quot;Bull. And don&#39;t you say there is nothing between the two of you. It&#39;s 
because of her that you spend all your time away from the Palace, isn&#39;t 
it? Hell, the Tourmaline Room still has scorch marks on the floor from 
nearly 20 years ago because of the two of you. Someone should lock the 
two of you in a room and leave you there until you either make up or 
kill each other.&quot;

The Senshi of Jupiter slowly raised a clench fist, but it was caught by 
Ruliya. &quot;Both of you. Stand down. Now!&quot; She whispered harshly. &quot;If the 
two of you want to duke it out, go find a deserted asteroid to fight on 
and beat yourselves senseless there. Don&#39;t forget where we are.&quot;

Nanami angrily pulled her arm from Ruliyas&#39; grip and turned away from 
the others while Nae smirked at her back. Behind the drapes, I quietly 
breathe a sigh of relief. I don&#39;t like to think about what happened 
back then; I did some things I then wasn&#39;t proud of. Shaking my head, I 
think about the other thing that Nae had talked about. My Pai? The next 
leader of the Inners&#39;? I chuckle softly; while she might be 
experienced, she was also quite shy and preferred to stay out of the 
limelight.

&quot;I&#39;ll think about it.&quot; I heard Nanami growl softly, her back still 
turned. &quot;What you said about Pai, that is.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s all I ask.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take your suggestion under advisement.&quot; Ruliya said, looking at 
Nae. &quot;But it&#39;s still too early to even mention this to the Queen. 
Understand?&quot;

The redhead shrugged and turned to face the massive doors at the other 
end of the Crystal Hall where a small commotion was happening.

The doors opened slowly, causing the crowd to fall silent. I watch as a 
white Mau slowly padded down the aisle to finally come to a stop before 
the Queen. He bowed low, then sat back on his haunches and addressed 
the Queen in a rather tired sounding voice.

&quot;Queen Serenity the thirty-fourth, Lady Senshi, Lords and Ladies of the 
Court; It gives me great pleasure to present to you the Princess of 
Venus; she who is the star of Nahid; the future Senshi of Venus. Lady 
Shuura.&quot;

A blonde blur moved down the aisle, only to stop and leap several feet 
forward and land next to the Mau. &quot;Have no fear, for Shuura is here! 
V!&quot;

I blink once. Twice. Three times. Yep, she&#39;s still there, holding a 
ridiculous pose with one hand forward and two fingers extended making a 
&#39;V&#39;. I glance over at young Pai and the other girls. Rion has a look of 
disbelief on her face and Myung had lowered her head into her hands and 
was shaking it slowly. Young Pai had a somewhat bemused expression; but 
I could clearly see her shoulders slump slightly. The Princess, on the 
other hand...

&quot;Yay!&quot;

...had started to cheer at her future guardians&#39; entrance.

&quot;Well, you gotta admit,&quot; I hear Nae say, &quot;she sure knows how to make an 
entrance.&quot;

---Present Time---

***********

&quot;Excuse me!&quot; I said angrily, yanking the remote from Minakos&#39; hands and 
changing the channel back to the motocross event. &quot;When did our house 
become the Hikawa Shrine?&quot;

&quot;Now Haruka.&quot; Michiru admonished me as she regained her seat, to be 
joined by Artemis who curled into her lap. &quot;So, Minako-chan, what 
brings you here?&quot;

&quot;Well, you see, me and the other girls were planning to go on a little 
trip after mid-terms next week for a little celebration, you know? I 
wanted to go to a hot spring; but everyone said we&#39;ve been to hot 
springs before so that idea got shot down. Usagi-chan wanted to be with 
Mamoru-kun; but she does that all the time. Rei-chan wanted to go to 
some ratty old temple; but there wouldn&#39;t be any cute boys so that got 
vetoed. Ami-chan wanted to visit some musty old museums or something; 
but none of us wanted to do that. But then Mako-chan suggested the 
beach; the water&#39;s still warm enough to go swimming, it&#39;s still great 
weather for sun-tanning, and all those cute boys in tight Speedos and 
oiled bodies. Yum-yum. So we all decided to go the beach!&quot; Minako 
explained animatedly.

&quot;Mina-chan?&quot; I heard Ami prompted softly.

&quot;Oh! That&#39;s right! Why I&#39;m here. Well, you see...&quot; the blonde started 
to fidget as she looked down at her hands. &quot;Mama wasn&#39;t too keen on the 
idea of me going off without supervision for some reason. Then I said 
&#39;What if we asked Michiru-san and Haruka-san if they could come with 
us&#39;, then she said &#39;You mean that beautiful young woman and her hunky 
piece of meat that adopted Chibi-usa-chans&#39; friend?&#39;.&quot;

&quot;...&#39;Hunky piece of meat&#39;?&quot; I snickered.

&quot;Yep! I couldn&#39;t believe it!&quot; Minako exclaimed, &quot;Well anyway, I said 
&#39;Yep. That&#39;s them&#39; then she said, &#39;I don&#39;t know. He might be yummy 
looking, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d trust him to keep you in line. What 
about that nice woman...Meioh-san was it?&#39; then I said, &#39;You mean 
Setsuna-san?&#39; then she said, &#39;Perfect! Of course you can go with the 
three of them keeping you out of trouble!&#39; then she went and called 
Usagi-chans&#39; mom and told her that she had no problem with me going 
since the three of you are coming with us and Tuskino-san said if 
that&#39;s the case then Usagi-chan could go too. So...&quot;

&quot;Oh Mina-chan...&quot; Ami admonished gently.

&quot;Don&#39;t blame Mina for this one.&quot; Artemis said from Michirus&#39; lap; and I 
look over at him and suddenly feel slightly envious of the cat as she 
petted him. &quot;I heard the entire conversation and she recited it almost 
word for word; even the bit about Haruka being &#39;yummy&#39;. Not even Minako 
could&#39;ve jumped a conclusion as fast as her mother did.&quot;

Minako stood up and turned to face the room. With a deep breath, she 
dropped to her knees and clasped her hands together. &quot;Please? Pretty 
Please? Can you come with us? Pleeeeeaaaaaaaasssssssssseeeeeeeee???&quot; 
she begged.

The three of us shared a look. &quot;Well, Hotaru-chan is off from school 
that week as well...&quot; my love hedged.

&quot;And it&#39;s been a while since we&#39;ve been on a vacation...&quot; I muse, 
glancing at Setsuna. Seeing her nod, our decision is made.

Besides, the thought of seeing Michiru, Setsuna, and the Inners in 
skimpy swimsuits was very, very appealing to me.

&quot;Alright. We&#39;ll go.&quot;

&quot;Wai!&quot; Minako exclaimed as she got to her feet, grabbed my arm, and 
hauled me off the couch. &quot;Come on! Let&#39;s go call Mama!&quot;

I reluctantly allow myself to be pulled out of the room and to the 
telephone. Reaching the phone, I take a good long look at Minako rear 
end as she dials. After she dials, she hands me the phone and I spend 
the next few minutes confirming with the blondes mother that yes, we 
would be going with Minako on their trip and no, I wouldn&#39;t make any 
moves on her then and yes, I do work out constantly and no, I wouldn&#39;t 
be able to join her for tea.

&quot;You&#39;re mother is an...aggressive woman.&quot; I say carefully hanging up 
the phone.

&quot;Tell me about it.&quot; Artemis says at our feet. &quot;I&#39;ve seen her flirt with 
the mailman, the milkman, the repair man, the neighbors, strangers on 
the street...&quot;

&quot;Artemis!&quot; Minako protested.

&quot;It&#39;s true! She&#39;s a bigger flirt that you!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not a flirt! I just like to explore every possible opportunity!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the spirit!&quot; I say, giving her shoulder a friendly squeeze 
while incidentally getting a nice feel of her supple muscles.

Returning to the living room, Minako bows to Michiru. &quot;Thank you so 
much, Michiru-san.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome, Mina-chan.&quot;

Walking over to where Setsuna and Ami sat, the blonde gave the younger 
girl a friendly hug. &quot;I&#39;ll see you later, Ami-chan.&quot;

&quot;Bye, Mina-chan.&quot;

&quot;And thank you very much, Setsuna-san.&quot; Minako bowed low.

&quot;Minako-san.&quot;

The bubbly blonde looked at Setsuna and Ami for a moment, and then 
smiled. &quot;I&#39;ll see you all later! Bai-bai!&quot;

I walked Minako to the front door, Artemis following behind. Arriving 
there, I opened the door and smiled. To my surprise, she looked at me 
with a mischievous grin.

&quot;I know something you don&#39;t know!&quot; she said in a sing-song voice.

&quot;Oh? What?&quot; I asked curiously.

&quot;That would be telling. Maybe you&#39;ll find out at the beach! Ja ne!&quot;

Watching her skip down the walkway, I shake my head in bemusement. &quot;Do 
you have any idea what that was about?&quot; I ask, looking down at the 
white cat at my feet.

&quot;I&#39;ve lived with Mina for years now and I still can&#39;t figure her out.&quot; 
Artemis sighed as he looked up at me. &quot;You&#39;re not in the market for a 
cat, are you? I&#39;m quiet, well trained, well groomed, self sufficient, 
and come with excellent references. All I need is a kitty-door, some 
milk, some tuna, and the occasional petting and cuddle.&quot;

&quot;Nope, sorry.&quot;

&quot;Sigh. Oh well, it was worth a try.&quot; He said as he moved to follow his 
&#39;owner&#39;.
