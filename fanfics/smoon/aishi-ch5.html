<h1>Aishiteru (part 5 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/pyrovenus.html">Pyro Venus</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/aishi-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Minako&#39;s eyes flitted over the chalkboard, her mind in reality wandering 
to what she had seen. Ami. And Rei. Kissing. How was this possible? 
After that one night. That one miraculous night, Rei just up and decided 
&#39;Hey, I love Ami&#39;?! What was the matter here?

A lot was the matter. The blonde had finally made up her mind that she 
was in love with Rei. Rei went off to go make out with Ami. What was 
next? Minako loved Rei. She loved her so much, and just didn&#39;t 
understand.

Why was Rei doing this?

Her cobalt eyes welled up with tears at the thought that she may have 
lost the raven-haired miko forever.

Rei thought over Ami&#39;s words carefully, picking out the bits and pieces 
that would serve her situation best. A pad of notebook paper and a 
pencil were spread out in front of her. She had skipped class for Ami&#39;s 
lesson on love, and knew she needed to make a list.

On the paper so far were the following words.

1) Minako&#39;s been dying to go to that new Latin club downtown

2) Usagi will probably drag her there tonight

3) Ask somebody to go there with me

Possibilities:

A) Yuuchiro

B) Motoki

C) Mamoru (player)

She smiled, recalling the piece of valuable information she had just 
written down. Every once in a while, Mamoru would go out with another 
woman to &#39;expand his tastes&#39;. Usagi didn&#39;t know this, of course. 
Wouldn&#39;t it be just wonderful to make both Minako AND Usagi jealous?

Then again, she didn&#39;t want to hurt her Princess. No matter how much 
Serenity had hurt her in the Silver Millennium.

Somehow, Rei&#39;s mind wandered to that one kiss. That one shocking kiss 
delivered by none other than Ami. The taste the Ice Goddess&#39; tongue had 
left in her mouth still resided, the passion of the moment still flowing 
within her veins as she remembered the way Ami&#39;s hand had caressed her 
breast and thigh. Her touch had been so soft, so gentle...

What was she thinking?! This was the way she used to dream about Minako! 
What was wrong with her?!

Then, a thought she had never believed she would think crept into her 
brain, uninvited.

Was she in love with them both?

&quot;Hi. This is Minako&#39;s answering machine. Please leave a message after 
the beep. I might respond!&quot;

&quot;Mina-chan! This is Usagi. Ummm...just wondering how you&#39;re doing! I 
know that thing with Rei was quite a nasty shock, so I have a question 
to ask. There&#39;s that new Latin club downtown. Wanna go? If all else 
fails, you can drown your sorrows in a margarita or something! Call me 
when you get this-&quot;

&quot;Hello?&quot; Minako&#39;s groggy voice answered the phone. Usagi smiled, knowing 
that Minako never refused a club invitation.

&quot;Hey V-Babe!&quot; Usagi cheerily greeted her friend, blue eyes wide and 
sparkly. &quot;Wanna hit the club tonight?&quot;

&quot;Usa-chan, I&#39;m not too sure... I mean, I&#39;m just really depressed and- &quot;

&quot;I know! This club will do you good. Think about it...really hot guys 
that keep staring at you, music, lights, the whole nine yards! It&#39;ll be 
fun!&quot; Persisted Usagi, standing her ground.

&quot;But-&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t take no for an answer!&quot;

&quot;Well...okay.&quot; The discouraged blonde muttered, spirits raising just the 
slightest bit at the thought of dancing the night away with her best 
friend by her side.

&quot;Great! I&#39;ll be over in an hour to help you pick something out! You want 
to look STUNNING!&quot;

&quot;But, Usagi...&quot;

CLICK the dial tone signaled that the odango atama had hung up the 
phone. Minako sighed and set her phone down as well, wondering why in 
the world Usagi wanted her to look &#39;stunning&#39;.

&quot;Ooooh! How about this orangeish one!&quot; Squeeled Usagi, grabbing a slinky 
strapless topaz dress from Minako&#39;s closet. The blonde shook her head, 
pointing to a rip in the seam of the left hip. Usagi frowned and put the 
dress back.

&quot;It&#39;s nothing that can&#39;t be fixed! When was the last time you wore it?&quot;

&quot;About a week ago.&quot; Answered Minako, twisting a part of her bangs around 
her pinky nervously. &quot;Why do you want me to look so gorgeous, anyway?&quot;

&quot;Minako, this club has CLASS. You need to look good to get in! Surely 
you know that!&quot; Usagi exclaimed, smiling. &quot;Plus, I hear Motoki will be 
there...&quot; She added slyly.

&quot;And what exactly are you suggesting?&quot; Demanded Minako angrily, jumping 
up from her bed.

&quot;Just kidding! Geez! Can&#39;t you take a joke?&quot; Usagi laughed at the 
blonde&#39;s reaction.

Minako blushed a delicate rose, her eyes apologetic. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, 
Serenity. I just...&quot;

&quot;I know. You&#39;re confused.&quot; The odango-haired blonde said sincerely, 
stepping closer to Minako and lightly touching her cheek, a 
feather-light touch that sent a shiver of delight coursing through the 
Senshi of Love&#39;s veins.

&quot;I just don&#39;t know what to think anymore... I mean, Every time I think 
of Rei, these memories begin creeping up on me...&quot;

&quot;Memories?&quot;

&quot;Memories of the Silver Millennium-&quot;

&quot;Memories like...this?&quot; Asked Usagi, touching her lips to the other 
girl&#39;s, her tongue just barely touching the rim of Minako&#39;s lips.

Minako&#39;s eyes grew wide as she realized that this kiss was what she had 
been craving for the longest time. The kiss of her Princess, the one she 
had fallen in love with in the Silver Millennium. She remembered...

&quot;Serenity...&quot; She moaned as the blonde left a trail of sweet, passionate 
kisses down her neck, her muscles tensing as her mind exploded in a 
burst of ecstacy.

&quot;Yes, Venus?&quot; Usagi asked, pushing Minako backwards onto the mattress.

&quot;Serenity, we can&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;Why not? This is what you&#39;ve been craving. I can see it in your eyes.&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t do this...Rei...&quot; Protested Minako helplessly, pushing Usagi 
off of her. &quot;Serenity, I&#39;m in love with Rei, and this really isn&#39;t 
helping...&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t seem to mind in the past.&quot;

&quot;The past is the past. I can&#39;t hurt Rei like this! No matter how much 
she hurt me today!&quot; Minako added, seeing the disbelieving look on 
Usagi&#39;s angelic face.

&quot;I see.&quot; Stated Usagi flatly, her eyes displaying no emotion whatsoever.

&quot;Usa-chan... I love you, but not the way I used to. I don&#39;t think that 
Rei is truly in love with Ami, and I&#39;ve decided that I&#39;ll do whatever it 
takes to win her back.&quot; Minako firmly stated, eyes narrow and unyielding 
as if a different person had taken a hold of the blonde girl.

&quot;It&#39;s settled then. Rei&#39;s going to be at the club. You&#39;ll confess your 
feelings to her tonight.&quot; Whispered Usagi with a slight smile. Minako&#39;s 
mouth dropped open in shock.

&quot;Wha- you knew she&#39;d be there?!&quot;

&quot;Yep!&quot; An enthusiastic Usagi exclaimed, eyes filled to the brim with 
mirth. &quot;And I was just testing your devotion to her!&quot; She added as 
Minako blinked, mouth still agape.

Rei arrived at the club in a short strapless minidress, hanging all over 
Yuuchiro. The crimson color really set off her dark hair, and her violet 
eyes scanned the room in search of that familiar red hairbow.

&quot;She&#39;s not here, I guess...not yet anyway.&quot; Muttered the miko as 
Yuuchiro tightened his grip on her waist possessively. Men turned and 
stared at her, their eyes wide and searching, as if to say &#39;is she just 
another whore?&#39;. She just smiled and ran a hand through Yuuchiro&#39;s 
shaggy black hair.

&quot;What say we sit over on that couch?&quot; She questioned motioning to a 
love-seat next to the gargantuan speakers. Yuuchiro smiled and nodded, 
amazed that Rei had taken him to this club, of all places.

Walking through the large crowd of people was something that Rei wasn&#39;t 
used to. The pulsating rhythm of the music&#39;s beat made the ebony- haited 
miko want to shake her hips to the vibrations, but she knew she had to 
save it for when Minako walked in. So instead they sat, her legs 
brushing against his every once in a while.

Yuuchiro still couldn&#39;t believe his luck, placing a hand on Rei&#39;s knee 
and rubbing his hand upward along her thigh. She didn&#39;t jerk away like 
he thought she would, and instead scooted in closer to him, her breath 
raising the hair on the back of his neck. He smiled, his hand slowly 
wandering upward to where it met the hem of her dress.

Inwardly, Rei cringed. This wasn&#39;t something she&#39;d planned on, but she 
could see Minako from across the room with Usagi, having just walked in. 
She had to make it look realistic.

She covered his hand with her own, breathing deeply as if she was filled 
with wanting. Realistically, she was a VERY good faker.

So his hand traveled upward, and her hand somehow found it&#39;s way up his 
shirt, her fingers tracing little circles on his chest. She enjoyed the 
way his muscles stiffened at her touch.

Suddenly, a pulsing Latin beat struck up, and everybody in the crowd 
whooped in delight.

&quot;Come on.&quot; She ordered, removing her hand from his chest and jumping up. 
He followed her like a dog.

They stopped in the middle of the dance floor and she backed into his 
arms, shaking her hips to the beat, her hands secured on his waist.

His hands caressed her figure, stopping long enough to grind his lower 
abdomen on her sensually. You could practically feel the erotic tension 
emanating from them as they danced, her breasts jiggling and hips 
swaying as if she were a feather, his breathing sharp and tense.

She turned around, grinding against him, a bead of sweat appearing upon 
her forehead as she saw Minako&#39;s shocked face. Rei smiled inwardly, 
knowing that it was sheer torture for the blonde. The miko looked back 
at Yuuchiro, leaning backward slightly. He got the message and leaned 
into her, his face only centimters from her breasts.

Rei felt his hand slip around her waist, and she lifted her feet from 
the ground, her legs around his waist suddenly. She leaned her torso 
backwards even further, her hair piling upon the ground. She could hear 
the cheers of most of the men in the club ringing in her ears.

A flash of movement caught her eye, and she felt a tap on her shoulder. 
She removed her legs from Yuuchiro&#39;s waist, and turned around, expecting 
to see the club&#39;s manager or something.

Instead, Minako was there, smirking slightly as she motioned for 
Yuuchiro to sit down. Surprisingly the man obeyed the blonde and went to 
sit on the love-seat.

Another, harder beat struck up, and Minako began to dance, her hips 
swaying and her smile so inviting that Rei couldn&#39;t resist going along 
with it. She danced her way smoothly toward the blonde, placing both of 
her hands on Minako&#39;s waist from behind and grinding again, just as 
Yuuchiro had done to her. Only she could hear Minako groan lusciously. 
Only she could feel her muscles tighten as her hand trailed the blonde&#39;s 
thigh voluptuously.

&quot;Are you-really in love-with Ami?&quot; Minako panted, turning and caressing 
Rei&#39;s groin with her own, making Rei moan in response. Unable to get her 
vocal chords to work, the miko simply shook her head.

&quot;That&#39;s what I thought.&quot; Whispered the blonde with a small smile. &quot;What 
about Yuuchiro?&quot; She questioned, using the same treatment.

&quot;No.&quot; Rei groaned huskily, eyes filled with pleasure and longing.

Minako smiled once more. &quot;Figured. He&#39;s not your type.&quot;

The dance then ended, and Minako led Rei off of the dance floor. They 
walked out of the club, hand in hand, unaware of the hundreds of eyes 
following their departure.</pre>
