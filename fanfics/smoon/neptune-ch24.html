<p>When she was just starting to run, Haruka  ran the hurdles against three classmates. Five hurdles in, she heard an  awful sounding crack behind her, followed by the coach’s whistle  stopping the race. She turned around to see that one of the girls had  caught her foot on the hurdle, tripped, and fallen face first to the  track. The girl’s lip was split open and her nose was broken. Haruka  watched, shaken, as the nurse was called out to attend to her, the girl  lying completely motionless after having been knocked out. When she  finally did come to, she began to cry uncontrollably in pain as she  wept for her mama.</p>
<p>She hadn’t thought of the event in a long  time, the memory slowly fading over time. The sight in front of her,  however, strangely reminded her a bit of that scene.</p>
<p>A security  guard lay motionless on the ground next to his post outside the water  treatment center. He was face down, and completely motionless, just as  her classmate had been. Uranus’ heart began to thump in her chest as  she slowly stepped over and knelt down, putting a gloved hand to the  guard’s neck. She’d never actually seen a dead person up close before,  and while she hoped that somehow she was wrong she had a sinking  feeling that the witch had killed him.</p>
<p>Just as Sailor Uranus felt  a pulse the guard let out a groan. The Senshi breathed out a sigh of  relief as she carefully turned him over, revealing a scorch mark on the  front of his uniform where his heart crystal had been extracted.</p>
<p>Neptune  meanwhile had found a large hole in the chain link fence around the  water plant, and a very familiar white car with black star decal parked  outside the main facility. As she came closer to the fence, she sensed  something was off. Picking up a nearby stick, she tossed it at the  fence. The stick struck the fence, setting off sparks in the air before  landing on the ground singed. She made a mental note of the fact that  the fence was electrified as she turned and walked over to Uranus,  placing a hand on the blonde’s shoulder. “Ruka,” she whispered softly.</p>
<p>Sailor  Uranus reached up and put her own hand over Neptune’s. Their fingers  intertwined as the blonde silently looked up. “How long will he last  like this?”</p>
<p>Neptune knelt down next to her. “Four, maybe four and  a half hours at the most.” She looked back over to the hole in the  fence. Security lights shone down all around the plant’s perimeter  except for the area they now found themselves in, almost as a silent  warning of what lay ahead. “Ruka, are you ready for this?”</p>
<p>Uranus  stood up and nodded. Sailor Neptune led the way through the hole in the  chain link fence. Once past the fence, they walked side by side towards  the main facility. Both Senshi reached for the other’s hand, seeking  courage from each other.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>The men and  women of the Tokyo Water Treatment Center lay like logs of wood around  her as she gathered the last of the crystals into her sack. Ash fell  from the tip of the cigarette she held clenched between her lips as she  checked her watch again. It was five minutes to midnight and the two  bitches had yet to show up. She reached into her pocket and pulled out  a bottle of whiskey. Opening it, she gulped the rest of its contents  down.</p>
<p>“Guided by a new eon, Sailor Uranus acts with elegance.”</p>
<p>“Likewise, guided by a new eon, Sailor Neptune acts with grace.”</p>
<p>Zultan  smiled gleefully as she tossed the whisky bottle over her shoulder,  hearing it shatter behind her. The two Senshi stood in front of her,  directly in front of one of the larger drums used in the filtration  process. “I was wondering when you two were going to get here.”</p>
<p>“Where are the pods?” Sailor Neptune demanded.</p>
<p>“Pods?” Zultan asked with a chuckle, “What pods?”</p>
<p>“You know what pods!” Sailor Uranus growled, “The ones you threatened to infect Tokyo with!”</p>
<p>“Oh, <em>those</em> pods,” Zultan laughed. “Why, there all in here,” she said as she  pointed to the side of her head, “You see, I made them all up.”</p>
<p>Neptune narrowed her eyes as she glared angrily at the witch. “You what?”</p>
<p>“I’m  sorry,” Zultan cackled, “But do you have any idea how funny the two of  you look when you get mad? You make it hard for me to keep a straight  face?”</p>
<p>Neptune suddenly felt a storm surge within her being as  Zultan continued to laugh. Uranus meanwhile had balled her hands up  into fists. “If you think we’re funny now,” she said in a low tone,  “You’re going to find what we do to you damn near hysterical.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”  Zultan asked, “Thinking of using one of our attacks, are we? I  shouldn’t think so, not with all these water tanks and high pressure  valves all around us. One badly aimed ‘deep submerge’ and either we’re  inundated with twelve thousand gallons of water within ten seconds or  we blow up the facility. And while the three of us may stand a small  chance of getting out in time, I’m not so sure about them,” she said,  indicating the men and women lying unconscious behind her.</p>
<p>Uranus gritted her teeth. “Damn.”</p>
<p>“Uranus, be careful,” Neptune warned, “I can sense she’s hiding something.”</p>
<p>“But  to get back on topic,” Zultan continued, “No, I don’t have enough pods  to contaminate all of Tokyo. I only have these two,” she said as she  pulled two of the Professor’s pods out of her jacket pockets. She began  to juggle them as she fixed her eyes on Sailor Neptune. “You’ve been a  thorn in my side for months now,” she hissed, a look of pure hatred  replacing the witch’s earlier bemusement. “It ends now, one way or  another.” Before either Senshi had time to react, she stopped juggling  and brought both pods up to her mouth.</p>
<p>Neptune’s eyes widened in horror, “No!”</p>
<p>“Blech,  these really do taste like shit.” Zultan groused as she swallowed down  the last of the pods. The witch abruptly clutched her abdomen and let  our an ear-splitting scream as she doubled over in pain. She began to  shake uncontrollably, her mouth foaming up as she looked one last time  at Sailor Neptune. “I’ll see you in <strong>hell!</strong>” she shrieked as her  back began to bulge, the sound of cracking and popping filling the air  as blood-red tentacles pushed their way out of her back. They began to  wave wildly in the air as the witch’s eyes rolled back and two more  tentacles slithered out of her mouth. Blood began oozing from her ears  and nose as she sank to her knees, her arms outstretched. Her neck  began to elongate and her chest and abdomen expanded until, with a  final ripping sound, her neck severed and her chest burst. Like a moth  emerging from its chrysalis, Zultan’s former body was discarded and  left behind as a tentacled daemon emerged, covered in the blood and  gore of its former body and with a single beak-like mouth near the  center.</p>
<p>Two of its tentacles shot outward towards Sailors Uranus  and Neptune. Both Senshi managed to leap out of the way just in time,  but the daemon did manage to grab hold of a wooden chair which it  pulled back towards itself, biting it in half with its beak.</p>
<p>“What do we do?” Sailor Uranus asked, “We can’t attack it here.”</p>
<p>Neptune nodded. “We need to lure it out of the building.”</p>
<p>Uranus  looked around quickly as the thing began to move itself closer to them.  She saw a clear area between two large tanks. “World shaking!” she  yelled, sending her attack barreling between the tanks and into the  brick wall behind it, leading to the outside. “You want us?” she yelled  at the daemon as both she and Sailor Neptune raced for the opening,  “Come and get us!”</p>
<p>The thing gave out a screech as it stretched  out with its tentacles and grabbed onto any stationary objects it could  find in order to pull itself forward. Slowly, one of its tentacles  began to bulge at its tip, transforming itself into a primitive eye in  order to see where it was going. Once outside the building, it saw its  hated rival Neptune standing beneath a security light staring back at  it, her arms crossed and her eyes defiant.</p>
<p>“Look at yourself, Zultan,” she said. “Look at what you’ve done.”</p>
<p>The daemon screeched once more as it continued to creep forward.</p>
<p>“Was it worth it, Zultan?” Neptune continued, “Has any of this been worth it?”</p>
<p>The  thing answered by shooting out its tentacles at the Senshi. Sailor  Neptune leaped backwards, doing a flip in the air before landing just  out of reach. “Now Uranus!”</p>
<p>The daemon realized too late that it  had been so focused on the hated green-haired bitch in front of it that  it had forgotten completely about the other Senshi.</p>
<p>“World shaking!”</p>
<p>Sailor  Uranus focused all she had on the attack. Searing pain shot through the  daemon, causing it to let out a pained scream as it staggered from the  attack.</p>
<p>Neptune saw her opening, “Deep submerge!”</p>
<p>The force  of Sailor Neptune’s attack sent it hurtling directly into the  electrified fence. Both Senshi watched as her water attack combined  with the electric fence, the daemon shaking uncontrollably as its  tentacles became entangled in the fence’s wire mesh. Smoke began to  rise up from its body as the thing that had once been Zultan let out a  final agonized cry before disintegrating before their eyes into a tar  black puddle of goo. Two pods slowly rose up from the puddle, only to  crack open and turn to dust.</p>
<p>Uranus, slightly shaken, turned to Michiru. “We have to go back in the plant.”</p>
<p>Neptune  nodded. “Hai. We have to get the heart crystals, see if any of them  were talismans, and return the rest to their owners.”</p>
<p>As they began to head back into the building, Uranus turned to Neptune. “Does it get easier?”</p>
<p>Neptune  turned and looked into Uranus teal eyes. For the first time, they had  actually been forced to take a life. This hadn’t been an inanimate  object brought to life like in the past. It had been a human being, an  enemy maybe but still human. Sooner or later they would find the  keepers of the talismans and would be forced to do so again.</p>
<p>“No,” Neptune finally answered, putting her arm around Uranus’ shoulders. “But eventually you learn to live with it.”</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>From  her Time Gate, Pluto watched the two weary Senshi enter back into the  water treatment center. With a wave of her staff, the image faded.  Police who would later arrive on the scene would stumble upon the  ghastly remains of Zultan’s body left behind after she transformed into  a Daemon. They would note the stump where the witch had severed her own  pinky and would chalk the whole thing up to an unusually grizzly yakuza  hit.</p>
<p>Pluto had more pressing issues to deal with though. Earlier  today a young fourteen year old blonde girl, considered clumsy and a  crybaby by most of her peers, had encountered a talking cat and ushered  in the new age. The same event had repeated itself across a hundred  different timelines and alternate realities (viewing one of them from  her Time Gate, Pluto saw a young South African girl who would one day  become queen and ruler of Crystal Cape Town). The new eon that guided  Uranus and Neptune had begun today, and nothing would ever be the same  again.</p>
<p>Pluto was the Guardian of the Time Gate, a post Queen  Serenity had ordered her not to leave or abandon and one which she had  left several times these past few months. It was time for her to pull  back from her old friends Neptune and Uranus once more. They had their  mission, and she had hers. The future was always changing, and time was  in a constant state of flux. If Crystal Tokyo was to become reality she  would have to do what she could from here, once more behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Pluto  had managed to find and awaken Sailor Neptune and, through Neptune,  Sailor Uranus had awoken as well. She had kept her promise; the two  were reunited in the present. A smile slowly teased Pluto’s lips.  Perhaps Serenity hadn’t needed a third cat after all.</p>
