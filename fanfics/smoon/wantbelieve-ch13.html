<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Point of No Return<br />
</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What the-“</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  loud, persistent knocking that issued from her front door startled the  singer. In the darkness of the apartment, with only the television to  shed its flickering blue light on her surroundings, she stumbled over  her unpacked luggage which she’d only just rolled in the door and  abandoned earlier that afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The insistent knocks made  Minako edgy. Maybe it was her security guards, upset that the singer  hadn’t informed them of her whereabouts. Maybe it was her manager,  coming to make sure she was all right. Maybe Artemis had mailed himself  to London, upset that she had left without him. She opened the door.  Maybe it was…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei?” The singer was in a state of disbelief to  see her best friend on her doorstep, and for a split second, she  thought she was dreaming and felt compelled to jump into the other  woman’s arms.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She caught herself. This was the woman who had  driven her away from Tokyo. Minako’s hands rose to her face and with  the long sleeves of her sweater, she dabbed the corners of her reddened  eyes in defense of the tears that threatened to spill once more. <em>‘I can’t let her see me like this… I can’t handle this right now!’ </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To  bear witness to Minako’s fragile state almost tore Rei to pieces, and  when the door started to swing shut in her face, the miko was almost  too slow to react.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yet, when the heavy, wooden door slammed  solidly against her foot, crushing it against the doorframe, Rei did  little more than wince, but she never faltered. Without a word, never  losing eye contact with those watery caramel eyes that looked so hurt,  yet so hopeful, she shouldered her way through the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Damn it Minako, I’ve already lost you twice. I’m <em>not</em> willing to lose you a third time.” Her voice was quiet and deathly serious.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer found herself backing away from the miko by the sheer  determination she saw in those dark eyes, until she came to a gentle  stop with her back to the foyer wall. She was speechless, for even as  forceful and passionate as Rei’s character had always been, the fire  she saw in the other woman’s eyes was unmatchable. There was no  awkwardness to be found in that dark glare. Staring at each other in an  endless silence, the front door floated closed and latched shut with a  click of finality.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t understand you, Minako.” Rei’s voice  teetered with emotion but her strong and steady hands found the other  woman’s shoulders gently. “Every time you’re close to getting what you  want, you flake out. Just like five years ago, when you learned to live  as yourself and not as Venus, and you ran away from us to have the  surgery in secret even though you had <em>me</em> there to help you  through it… just like a millennia ago, when Venus sacrificed herself to  the enemy in hopes of defeating it herself even though you had <em>me</em> there to depend on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko paused. She pondered the weight of her words, and then spat them out anyway. “You’re a <em>coward</em> Minako.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something  in the singer finally snapped and she nearly growled at the miko, “If  you came half way across the world to chastise my actions in the past,  when <em>you’re</em> the one who drove me away, then I want nothing to do with you! If you couldn’t even have the common decency to tell your…your…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer’s momentum crash landed. The term ‘best friend’ seemed to  belittle the depth of the relationship they’d shared, but what else was  it between them?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Girlfriend.” The slightest twinge of embarrassment laced Rei’s voice… it had been impulsive, but she’d meant it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer was too shocked to believe the words that had come out of Rei’s  mouth, but when she noticed that the crimson blush that tinged the  other woman’s cheeks didn’t diminish the determination in the miko’s  dark eyes, she knew Rei had meant it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I should have told you  about the Priestess position.” Rei’s confession was blunt and nearly  rushed; too many thoughts, too many emotions that had been bottled up  threatened to overflow. “I should have been a lot more open about a lot  of things. But I was dealing with too much at once. My future, Reiko’s  memories… <em>you!</em> I was… afraid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako had bared witness  to Rei’s sheer determination on several occasions, and she knew when  the miko was putting one hundred and ten percent of herself out there.  She could sense Rei’s honesty, and could feel the other woman’s need.  The singer’s voice was as soothing as the hand she gently placed on her  best friend’s - <em>‘girlfriend’s’</em> - cheek. “Rei…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But the  miko’s thoughts had already been lined up and she wouldn’t let Minako’s  softness deter her progression of thoughts. “I rejected the Priestess  position.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako frowned. “But… why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko snorted.  Releasing the singer’s arms, she raised her hands in an empty gesture.  “Really! Am I the only one who thinks of the future? All of you were  either too wrapped up in the past or the present to remember that we  needed to plan for a future, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako surged forward, desperate to claim the space that seperated them. “I don’t understand, Rei.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  miko’s hands idly found the long sleeves of the singer’s sweater, and  when Minako’s fingers shyly laced between her own, Rei’s voice quieted  as she explained. “It was a decision I knew I’d have to make a long  time ago. You see, if I chose to become a priestess, I’d be negligent  in my duty to the Princess, to the others.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The singer could do  little else but gaze questiongly at the other woman and rub her thumb  across the top of Rei’s hand until the miko sighed and proceeded, “A  priestess in the shinto faith can’t be reincartnated, Minako. If  something were to happen and I couldn’t return to protect our  Princess…” Her voice lowered, and once again that blush that Minako  couldn’t resist colored Rei’s cheeks, “if I can’t return to protect <em>you</em>, then I want no part of being a Priestess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer melted at the miko’s tender words. Closing her eyes, she found  herself submitting to a gentle embrace from the other woman. Although  she was elated to hear the words that had come closest to a confession  of her feelings from the other woman, and although she was comforted to  understand just how much thought Rei had put into their relationship,  she also couldn’t imagine what a difficult experience it must have been  to be at odds between a duty that Rei had’t even wanted in the first  place, and the spirituality that drove her every day life. “Rei-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  dark haired woman sushed the singer. “I knew this. And yet, I continued  to be a miko, progressing to this point for myself in order to hone my  powers… although they are borne of my senshi strength, they are also  closely tied to my faith.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">”I’m sorry.” The singer’s apology was  muffled by Rei’s shoulder. “I over reacted. I was just so certain you  would have taken the position. I thought you would move on without me.  This all comes as a bit of a shock.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko allowed a long  suffering sigh to escape her lips, but hugged the slightly smaller  woman closer to her never the less. “It’s just so like you to have a  predestined outlook in every life. Can’t you stop playing the martyr  just this once and get the other half’s input before jumping to  conclusions? Really, for such a determined leader, you sure give up on  things quickly. I mean, we finally start getting closer and you pull  away. Don’t you think that our relationship would have played a factor  in my decision?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako looked up to Rei shyly, an apologetic smirk teasing the corner of her lips. “You know what they say about old habits…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  snorted her agreement. “I guess we’re both a victim of that one.  Besides,” she added dryly, “although it may serve to create more  interest in <em>your</em> line of work, I don’t even want to imagine how word of our relationship, if… <em>when</em> it’s discovered, would damage either of my shrines. The idea of a  lesbian Priestess isn’t likely to go over well by the shinto elders.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Although she was excited to hear Rei verbalize their relationship so, meaning that she <em>did</em> intend for others to know that they were together, Minako couldn’t help  but feel guilty that she was part of the reason that Rei had to put her  dream of becoming a Priestess aside.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When the singer’s smirk  faded into a sad expression, Rei shook her head. “I didn’t say that to  make you feel bad. It’s a cruel reality, but one I accept. And I’ve  already made my decision.” The miko turned her nose to the air, a  mocking expression on her face, “I want to be with you, Minako.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">”But you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">”Would you forget about <em>me</em>, Minako?” Rei asked, looking down at the singer’s troubled expression. “Just for once, what do <em>you</em> want?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>What do I want?’</em> The question sounded foreign, even in the confines of her own mind.  After spending two lifetimes being more concerned for everyone other  than herself, the blunt question; so characteristic of her best friend,  shocked her enough to be equally blunt. The tears returned once more,  but this time, they weren’t so bitter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">”I want, <em>you</em> Rei! I… I want <em>you</em>,”  and although her words brought a gentle smile to the other woman’s  face, her voice dropped to a whisper, “but I don’t want you to regret-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Perhaps  it was to hide her crimson cheeks, perhaps it was to gain the courage,  but Rei pulled Minako into her once more, burying her nose behind the  singer’s ear where, in a raspy whisper, she settled the score once and  for all,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This isn’t about the priestess position anymore, Minako, this is about me loving you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  for one second; the only second she had ever allowed herself in any  lifetime, Minako allowed herself to be wholly consumed with her own  happiness to have heard that one four letter word that even a millenia  ago, their past personas had rarely used.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I… I love you too, Rei. So much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko snorted into the other woman’s ear. “Well duh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer smacked her lips and when she pulled away enough to see Rei’s  face again, she offered her blushing girlfriend a wide smile, thankful  that for all the awkwardness the miko could display, the two of them  had weatherd such a deep baring of their souls so easily. But they’d  both reached their limit, and after five years, the waiting, the  wondering, all of it was over, and they both had exactly what they  wanted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And now it was time to play. The singer smiled mischeviously. “So what will you do now? You can’t stay a miko forever or I’ll <em>never</em> get you into bed!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This time it was the miko that smacked her lips. “Please. You buy that? Like there’s a single virgin miko out there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s  eyes widened and her laugh was music to Rei’s ears. “So then all this  time I was being nice and not pushing myself on you for no reason?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not pushing yourself on me?” Rei asked incredulously. “Do you have any idea how hard it’s been for me to restrain myself?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was no accident that Minako’s half lidded eyes only enticed the other  woman further; she could almost feel the fire in Rei’s dark eyes  ignite. “I have <em>no</em> idea what you’re talking about.” She stated coyly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  for a half a second, Rei and Minako stared into each other eyes, and  with the recognition that the smoldering fires that reflected there  would not be extinguished; they breathlessly leaned into each other.  And when the culmination of a lifetime lived a millennia ago and five  years spent pining after each other resulted in one, passionate kiss  that threatened to consume them both, they surrendered to it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Pressing  Minako gently to the wall, Rei’s fingers danced along the hem of the  other woman’s sweater, glided underneath, and traveled along the smooth  skin of the other woman’s belly even as Minako desperately began  undoing the large buttons on the front of the miko’s wool coat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shoes  were kicked to the walls of the foyer. Rei’s coat only made it a few  feet, but Minako’s sweater held on a little longer. Finally, as Rei  pushed and Minako pulled, together, the two women stumbled down the  hallway, into the bedroom, and finally, onto the bed where Rei gently  pinned the half dressed, slightly smaller woman beneath her weight.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  when Rei’s wandering hand was abruptly stopped by the gentle pressure  of Minako’s own around her wrist, the passion drained out of the miko’s  kiss as their lips separated and her confused eyes searched the  singer’s.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This isn’t too fast?” Minako asked quietly, unassumingly. “I told you that I don’t want to push you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko smirked and relaxed. “I wouldn’t think that <em>you’d</em> be one to complain once we finally reached the point of no return.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer smiled mischievously; point of no return indeed. “Oh, I’m not  complaining,” she reached up to capture Rei’s lips once more, “not,”  she reached up to whisper hoarsely in Rei’s ear, “one,” she arched her  back to nip at Rei’s neck with her teeth, “bit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And with that, she rolled her body on top of Rei’s and claimed possession.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  the morning light that streamed freely through the gauzy curtains  became too much to bear, Aino Minako woke up slowly, a lazy smile  playing on her lips at the sight that greeted her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her form was  draped over her lover’s. Rei lay sleeping on her back, and although a  thin sheet – the only article of bedding left on the bed at all – hid  Minako’s view from much below the miko’s tantilizing colarbone, she  could feel Reiko’s arms wrapped loosely around her waist and could feel  her own legs tangled with those of the slightly taller woman’s.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  it was then that she knew that for all the hours they’d really learned  each other last night, she still hadn’t gotten her fill of the other  woman. Slowly, as if afraid to break the spell, Minako’s hand reached  out to brush away a long bang from Rei’s forehead…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But her hand went flying back in surprise when one of the miko’s dark eyes suddenly shot open.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  didn’t know if it was Minako’s flapping hands or the high pitched  squeak of shock that was cuter, but chuckling, she held the startled  singer to her form.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That wasn’t very nice.” Minako’s attempt at  pouting was reinforced by turning her face away to hide a mischevious  smile and rolling away onto her side.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko smiled at the  challenge and also rolled over, one arm snaking back under the sheet to  slide around the singer’s bare waist, and she spooned herself around  the other woman possessively. With her other hand, she pushed Minako’s  long mane away from her neck to lay a kiss on the sensitive skin. “You  know… I’ve never claimed to be a nice person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finding that her  tactic had paid in spades, Minako wasn’t about to mess with a good  thing and continued her mock pouting. “You’re right. You’re a mean,  mean person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei paused in her attention to Minako’s neck. “Am I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako found herself holding her breath, waiting to see what her lover would do next…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei!”  Minako’s hands shot to her sides where the miko was mercilessly  tickling the skin of her ribcage.“I’ll have you know,” she threatened  between laughs, “that I’m an expert at this game!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei stopped short and leaned her mouth to the singer’s ear. “I’m immune to this game. I’m not ticklish.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako looked back over her shoulder, catching Rei’s dark eyes. “I know for a <em>fact</em> that isn’t true.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Their  eyes narrowed at each other and the challenge between them ignited into  flame. Rivalry; the old standby need for competition, their only excuse  at one point in their lives to keep the lines of communication open  between them, was now just a source of fun and games.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The singer  flipped her body, turning towards the miko faster than the other woman  had anticipated, and Minako showed Rei even less mercy than had been  shown her. And as choked snorts and repressed laughs echoed around the  room, the two lovers fought for dominance in a tickle war until the all  pillows and the last remaining sheet had been thrown off the bed, and  exhausted, they were both gasping for air.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">From her vantage point  where her head rested on Rei’s stomach, Minako pointed at the miko’s  feet, which were actually pointed at the head of the bed, “Oh my god,  what happened to your toe?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei looked up and over her  girlfriend’s dark head of hair to look at her bruised appendage and  remembered the event all too clearly. “You shut the door on it last  night!” She exclaimed lightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The singer turned her head towards Rei and smiled apologetically, “I could kiss it and make it better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei rolled her eyes. “Its quite alright. I deserved it anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Quiet  contemplation followed as both women allowed themselves to dwell on  their conversation from the night before, but despite the more subdued  topic of conversation, there was no awkwardness or trepidation of  treading into what had once been unspoken territory.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know,”  Minako began, “Usagi-chan’s going to be upset. She really wanted to  throw a party for you over the Priestess position.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei snorted. “Yeah? Well, Usagi’s going to have to deal with it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s going to have to throw a party for <em>something</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Idly  twisting a lock of Rei’s long, raven hair, Minako paused. The two women  caught each other’s eyes in a look of complete understanding. Slowly,  one of Rei’s eyebrows raised in a playful arc. “I think I can come up  with <em>something</em> she can celebrate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A slow smile pulled at  Minako’s lips before she surrendered to a kiss that instantly rekindled  the memories and emotions of their passionate night before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Somehow, I think I’ll never get tired of this side of her.’ </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s Notes:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">First  of all, I’m really, really on the fence about this chapter. I’ve never  been one for ‘confessions of love’. Often times, in writing, they seem  contrived and forced. If it hadn’t been for Minako’s absolute <em>need</em> to hear those words in this chapter, Rei may have held off for who  knows how long. But… I just felt like it fit here, to my own  discomfort, so I hope it worked for you guys, too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As to a  priestess not being able to be reincarnated. I don’t know the validity  of this statement. When I was still in the planning stages of this  story (god, a year ago!), I did a lot of research on the Shinto faith,  trying to glean ideas from as many English sites as I could. I came  across that statement once and couldn’t find any other reference to it.  I may be totally wrong on this, but I put myself out on a limb and  tried it here.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So… yes, there is one more chapter to go, and then IWtBiS will be over. </span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And now… Preview of Chapter 14:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are  you sure you want to go through with telling the others?” Minako’s  quiet voice mingled with the drone of the engines. “We could wait, you  know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As if she’d been forcefully pulled back from another world, Rei blinked. “Huh? Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The singer titled her head. “Because you look like something’s still bothering you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  miko faltered; the singer had misread her hesitation; it had nothing to  do with revealing their relationship to their friends. It had taken her  years, but she’d learned to be comfortable with expressing her concerns  to Minako – more so these past few weeks - but even still, getting  started was never an easy task. “You were right,” she began, “I can’t  stay a miko forever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The singer laced her fingers between the other woman’s. “You’re worried about your future, Rei?”</span></p>
