<h1>Dreams Can Lie (part 11 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dreamlie-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>&#147; Terrestria! It&#146;s been so long!&#148; The woman smiled brightly at her. 
Terrestrial looked odd. She didn&#146;t move or say anything. Even as the 
stranger came toward her. The outer Senshi moved closer to their 
leader, alert for anything but what happened. Sailor Terrestrial&#146;s 
eyes had been filled with shock, now they were widened as strong arms 
enveloped her in a tight binding hug. Surprise was mixed in when soft 
pink lips met her full red ones. The other Senshi could see the 
discomfort she was in, her body had went rigid. This was why her 
guardians went into action. Pluto grabbed the woman, forcibly removing 
her from her Queen. Terrestrial fell back a bit into Neptune&#146;s hold.

&#147; No&#133;,No&#133; You can&#146;t be here. I banished you!&#148; The woman looked 
confused.

&#147; I found a way out. So I could get to you my love. And Endymion 
helped me.&#148; She waved to a general direction behind her. Everyone&#146;s 
eyes widened as Endymion appeared. His eyes were dazed and dead. He 
was wearing all black, standing there looking like a statue. 

&#147; Give me back my brother! I can&#146;t believe you took his mind! You 
could have found another way to get to me Hyphora!&#148; Terrestrial was 
pissed beyond belief. Sailor Moon was crying openly. And before anyone 
could register what was happening her and Hyphora were in the air.

&#147; Please stop crying. You are Serenity right?&#148; Moon nodded.

&#147; Is he your boyfriend?&#148; Moon shook her silvery blonde locks. 

&#147; No he is my husband and I want him back!&#148; Hyphora smiled and put a 
finger to her forehead. A dark light surrounded her. 

&#147; You can go with him.&#148; Moon&#146;s eyes glazed over. On the ground 
Terrestrial had her black angels wings expanded in all their glory. 
The only thing holding her back was Uranus.

&#147; Uranus, I order you to let me go!&#148; 

&#147; We have to protect you! The inners will save Serenity.&#148; 

&#147; Uranus, I am also her protector. Serenity is the most important of 
all of us!&#148; Terrestrial threw her off with a gust of energy. She flew 
upwards, sword in hand. The brunette Senshi slashed at Hyphora&#146;s hand. 
Causing the woman to break contact. Moon came out of her trance and 
flew into her sister in law. Terrestria held her close with one arm. 
The other held her sword.

&#147; Don&#146;t ever touch Serenity again. I&#146;ll kill you on the spot Hyphora.&#148; 
Hyphora looked surprised as the three floated to the floor.

&#147; Do you love her?&#148; 

&#147; She&#146;s my sister, of course I love her.&#148; She handed her sister to 
Venus. The outers had joined the inners at this point, watching and 
wondering how the Teres Queen knew Hyphora.

&#147; What do you want Hyphora?!&#148; Hyphora smiled and walked over to her. 
She quickly kissed her again and said: &#147; You&#148; 

&#147; Terrestria, I love you and you know it. That&#146;s all I want is your 
heart.&#148; Terrestrial pulled away. Unnoticed by anyone was how Mars was 
growling low in her throat and her fists were clenched more than the 
others.

&#147; But it&#146;s already taken. It&#146;s been that way for over 2,000 years. I 
have given my heart to Rei.&#148; Hyphora scowled.

&#147; Rei again! I trust you remember the moons my love? I know she&#146;s a 
Senshi. Which one is she?&#148; Terrestrial quickly joined her fellow 
Senshi. 

&#147; Don&#146;t you even.&#148; Hyphora put a finger to her chin in thought.

&#147; I will if you don&#146;t tell me. Do you want them all injured or worse?&#148; 
Terrestrial shook her head fiercely. 

&#147; I said no! Don&#146;t touch them!&#148; 

&#147; Well you really aren&#146;t one for blondes. And you like dark haired 
girls. So not the three blondes or the blue haired ones. By the way 
the brown haired one stands by the one in blue she&#146;s not Rei. Green 
hair is holding the one in orange. That leaves me a 50/50 chance with 
purple and red. Which one?&#148; Terrestrial&#146;s wings were back out, energy 
was cackling like mad.

&#147; Leave all of you. I will deal with Hyphora.&#148; 

&#147; No dragon! We will help this time.&#148; Saturn ran to her with a 
pleading look. No one noticed the blast of energy racing towards the 
purple haired girl. Saturn screamed as it came closer. 

&#147; Hotaru!&#148; The attack made contact. When the smoke cleared there was a 
nice whole in the ground. 

&#147; Where&#146;d she go!&#148; Hyphora looked around frantically. 

&#147; I&#146;m here. Uranus grabbed me in time.&#148; They all sighed in relief.

&#147; Damn, wrong target I guess.&#148; Hyphora shrugged and turned towards 
Mars.

&#147; You are Rei. Should have known that&#146;s why her balcony faced Mars.&#148; 
Hyphora got ready for another blast and shot it, aimed at Mars. 

&#147; REI!&#148; Terrestrial teleported in front of Mars. Hugging her waist and 
wrapping her large black wings around the raven haired Senshi. All the 
while Hyphora tried to stop the attack. It made contact as two screams 
were heard over the boom. The other Senshi called their names. Hyphora 
was shocked, not expecting for her to do that or have the time. Again 
smoke cleared. Showing tattered black wings and a bleeding back where 
clothing should have been. On the inside of the wings, Rei stared at 
her love. Terrestria held onto her desperately, she looked up.

&#147; Re&#133;Rei a-are you alright?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m fine. What were you thinking?&#148; 

&#147; Don&#146;t yell at me Rei, please. I can&#146;t live if you die.&#148;

&#147; Why are you so faithful?! We&#146;re not even together anymore. She loves 
you! Go with her and be happy! End this stupid fight.&#148; Terrestrial 
flinched a little at Mar&#146;s tone. She loosened her hold a little 
wincing as the wound from her back made itself noticed painfully. 

&#147; I can&#146;t go with her. I love you and it&#146;s not going to change. I 
think of you every second of my life. The day I die you will be my 
last thought.&#148; She was loosing energy from the flowing blood draining 
from her back and wings. They folded behind her as Terrestrial let go 
of her beloved&#146;s waist as her eyes drifted shut. Mars picked up the 
fallen angel as the others came over to them, Moon carrying her now 
unconscious husband. They laid them by a far wall. Rei instinctively 
kissed Terrestrial lightly on her full lips before joining the other 
Senshi in a half circle around the siblings. Hyphora wasn&#146;t looking at 
all happy.

&#147; Do you think you pathetic Sailor Senshi can keep me from my 
princess?&#148; Hyphora&#146;s summer pink eyes danced with hatred, her face 
looking truly demonic. 

&#147; Yes.&#148; Sailor Mars stepped forward, her flaming bow in hand.

&#147; It will be a pleasure to kill you all, especially you Mars. I could 
kill all of you with one shot!&#148; 

&#147; Show us.&#148; Mars was about to walk forward when a gloved hand pulled 
her back.

&#147; No. Let me take her on first. Protect the outer Queen.&#148; Uranus hand 
her Space Sword in hand.

The tall Senshi ran towards the odd haired woman. Bringing her sword 
around to cut at Hyphora&#146;s throat. Their was a clang as her golden 
blade met Hyphora&#146;s own sword. It was a black bladed sword with a 
strong dark wooden handle. With intricate carvings of dragon&#146;s and 
stars decorating the weapon. It was beautiful for such a dangerous 
item. Hyphora smirked meeting another blow to her upper chest easily. 
Uranus brought her sword in front of her chest to defend from frequent 
blows to her own chest. Hyphora sliced at her eight times, on the 
ninth she turned the dark blade up, throwing Uranus&#146;s arms into the 
air and kicking the her back with her left leg. The short haired 
blonde grunted in pain as she fell a few feet back. She ran back at 
Hyphora, punching the enemy in the cheek sending her a step back. 
Hyphora smiled wickedly and threw a spark of energy at her, which only 
grew larger on contact. Uranus yelled out in pain as she struggled to 
get back up. She quickly regained her energy as she heard a voice call 
out behind her. Uranus jumped up high as an energy attack whizzed by 
where she once was. The blue sphere of water slammed Hyphora into a 
wall twenty feet away. Amara landed gracefully next to her lover.

&#147; You shouldn&#146;t have done that.&#148; Neptune smiled.

&#147; I know, but it&#146;s too late now.&#148; 

&#147; She&#146;s not going to be down long. I estimate another few seconds.&#148; 
The aqua-haired woman nodded. Out of the hole in the wall came a blast 
of energy. Freeing a now very pissed off Hyphora. She came at the 
couple at record speed. Launching into an attack of kicks and punches. 
Hyphora never let up as she battered each woman. She grabbed at 
Neptune&#146;s left leg, twisting it until the bone broke with a sickening 
snap. Michelle cried out, but abruptly stopped as she met up with the 
wall she was thrown into. 

&#147; You bitch!&#148; Uranus came at her, getting a kick in at her face. It 
wasn&#146;t long until the evil woman blasted the blonde not to far from 
her girlfriend along the same wall. Hyphora wiped some blood from a 
corner of her mouth and whipped around to grin evilly at the others. 

&#147; Well. That was two of you useless Senshi. It seems double teaming me 
isn&#146;t going to work. Care to try all at once? I hate those long drawn 
out battles.&#148; The rest of the Senshi looked towards Sailor Moon. She 
nodded, her white wings spread and she was off. They followed suit, 
their own colorful wings appearing as they took off. 

Venus called upon her love-me chain. Lassoing the heart chain around 
Hyphora&#146;s sword hoping to take the wretched object away from her. The 
pig-tailed haired woman felt the tug on her weapon and went with it. 
She quickly punched Venus, taking control of her dark blade once 
again. Hyphora grabbed Mina by the neck and pushed the sword into her 
stomach. The golden haired woman screamed in agony as the blade sliced 
through her, though it did not go all the way. Hyphora pulled the 
sword out and with a vicious blow to Mina&#146;s new wound, sent the Love 
Senshi down for the count. She dodged an oncoming &#146;Dead Scream&#146; from 
Pluto. The demonic woman didn&#146;t have time though to dodge Sailor 
Saturn&#146;s glaive. Which cut the woman down her back, making her howl in 
pain. Her darkened to a blood red as she went after Saturn in a flurry 
of energy attacks. Making sure to keep the others from helping her 
with a small force field. Saturn screamed as the hilt of her own 
weapon stabbed into her spine, launching her forward. A ball of black 
energy followed soon after, crushing her high up in the wall.

A second later five attacks hit her from all sides. Hyphora fell to 
the ground with a loud thud. She growled and got up, jumping into a 
spin kick at Pluto. Pluto blocked it swiftly with her Garnet Rod, 
pushing her back. Garnet colored points surrounded Pluto, shaping into 
spears and she called her attack.

&#147; Time Spears!&#148; The spears sliced into Hyphora effectively slowing her 
down a bit and ripping at her clothing and skin. The multi-colored 
haired woman threw her own dark bladed daggers at Pluto. Two hooking 
into the Time Senshi&#146;s right leg. Hyphora grabbed the preoccupied 
woman&#146;s front bow, leading her down to the stony surface below. She 
let go in time to kick the woman down, accelerating her speed and hit 
the ground harder. Her hair was free of it&#146;s pigtails, and was now 
flying around her wildly as she turned only to meet up with Jupiter&#146;s 
green heel. She cried out in shock, flinging back a few feet. Mercury 
shouted out her own attack, only to have the enemy dodge and fire at 
the two Senshi. Hyphora pummeled them with everything she had. Soon 
sending them down to the hard floor, where she only sent more balls of 
glowing black energy to make sure they stayed down. Smoke once again 
cleared as two lone Senshi were left.

&#147; Well, two left. &#147; Moon and Mars flew at her at top speed, sending 
out attacks once in range. Hyphora dodged the attacks, kicking Moon 
down to the floor and going after Mars swiftly. She went into a flurry 
of punches and kicks, using all combinations. Effectively knocking the 
raven haired Senshi back against a wall. Once their shackles sprouted 
from the wall. Attaching to each of Rei&#146;s limbs and pinning her to the 
wall. Rei gasped as Hyphora smiled wickedly and sped after Sailor 
Moon. Who was just getting up, having trouble from the lack of energy. 

&#147; Serena! Watch out!&#148; Serena looked up in time too see the crazed face 
of the enemy approach. She brought her arms up in defense. Hyphora 
grabbed them, forcing the Neo-Queen to the ground. She only cackled in 
delight as black energy danced all over Serena&#146;s skin. Moon writhed in 
pain as the negative sparks coursed through her veins. 

Far back, lying against a wall, Terrestrial stirred next to her 
brother. How an attack like that was able to take her she would never 
know. Sound caught up with her as she heard Serenity&#146;s screams far 
away. Her eyes fluttered open as she tried to sit up. Pain swam 
through, reminding the beauty of the wound to her back. Terrestrial&#146;s 
black wings twitched softly and vanished from view as she leaned on to 
the wall. She looked over to see her brother unconscious still. 

- God, how long have I been out?! Where is everyone? Is it over 
already?&#148; Terrestrial ruled that out as she heard her sister&#146;s screams 
of agony and her beloved&#146;s shouts. Her head turned to see the rock 
floor littered with most of the Senshi. Rei was pinned to the wall and 
Serena was now knocked out from Hyphora&#146;s vicious attack. 

Terrestrial watched in horror as her old friend walked slowly over to 
the Fire Queen. Mars cried out in pain as Hyphora punched at her. The 
brunette tried to stand, but her legs refused to listen to her brain.

&#147; Do you hear me? You should have stayed away from her! Stupid bitch! 
This is what you get for taking Terrestria away from me! She&#146;s mine!&#148; 
Mars slumped down the wall when the shackles released her. Though soon 
her brain registered that she was flying in the air, but still unaware 
of the small points of energy being shot at her.

&#147; I always did love target practice!&#148; Hyphora finally let the Fire 
Senshi plummet to the stony earth below. 

Now Terrestrial&#146;s legs were working properly as she raced at warp 
speed to catch her falling love. They fell to the ground when Rei 
landed into her strong arms. 

&#147; Rei?! Oh please speak to me! Don&#146;t die on me damn it!&#148; Mars&#146;s eyes 
opened slowly, showing her cloudy amethyst eyes. She smiled weakly.

&#147; You caught me.&#148; 

&#147; Of course I caught you. I love you, my Firebird.&#148; Tears stung at her 
eyes at the sight of her love like this.

&#147; I guess now I can say I was stupid. I love you, Dragon. Forever and 
a day.&#148; Her eyes drifted shut, a blissful smile playing her lips, even 
with all her wounds. Terrestrial kissed her forehead laid her down 
next to Serena.

- Rest well love. I&#146;m gonna end this.- The brunette stood, her hands 
clenching, her ever growing anger rising. She turned to her former 
friend. 

&#147; Hyphora, how could you do this to me? My friends are critically 
injured and the love of my life is most likely dieing!&#148; Hyphora 
stepped closer, but stepped back again from the growl emanating from 
the Planet Senshi. 

&#147; I am the love of your life, I&#146;m not dieing. Those weaklings cannot 
be your friends! They have already poisoned your mind! Why can&#146;t you 
see that?!&#148; She couldn&#146;t contain it anymore. The power was swelling 
inside her and it wanted out. And there was only one way for her to 
release it.

&#147; You were once my good friend, now your this! I can&#146;t bear to look at 
you, let alone allow you to live! Say goodbye!&#148; Hyphora&#146;s eyes widened 
in fear. Energy was swirling around Terrestrial like it had it&#146;s own 
mind. Her stone released itself from her bow, floating to her hand. 
Once again she threw it like a card. It flew ten feet away and stopped 
at her words. 

&#147; DESTINY UNIVERSAL!&#148; The stone spun in place until it was a black 
ten-point star. It shot a stream of blinding white light at her as 
black orbs enveloped her body. Spinning her body and changing from 
periwinkle, to evergreen, then back to black. Finally they flew away. 
Revealing Universal Destiny in all her glory. 

She had changed&#133;a lot. Starting at her boots, those were the only 
things the same. They were black, designed like Saturn&#146;s used to be. 
Her skirt was three layers: white on top, black in the middle, and 
white on the bottom. The belt was silver with a small round clear oval 
in the middle. Her bodysuit was black with black short sleeves. Both 
her bows were white, the front hand her black ten point star in the 
middle, and the back had no stone. Her tiara was silver with a clear 
stone and her gloves were white with silver strips at the elbows. Her 
hair wasn&#146;t even the same color anymore. It was pure white, with two 
chestnut brown streaks framing her face. There still was the random 
silver strands though. 

&#147; Who are you now? This wasn&#146;t who you became last time.&#148; Hyphora 
stared in fear and shock at the vision before her. 

&#147; I am Universal Destiny. Queen Terrestria&#146;s ultimate form. You have 
wronged us by hurting the ones we love. Your punishment is death.&#148; Her 
voice was void of emotion and duo, showing that Terrestrial was still 
in there. 

Hyphora blocked the oncoming attack as Universal Destiny flew at her. 
Destiny punched at her numerous times, causing bruise after bruise. 
Hyphora finally lashed out, missing Gia&#146;s daughter by a few 
centimeters with her black blade. The powerful Senshi knocked the 
sword from her enemies hand, tossing it a few yards away. She dropped 
down and swept at Hyphora&#146;s feet, who jumped to avoid falling over. 
Universal Destiny used her other leg and hands to push off of the 
ground and summersault over Hyphora&#146;s head, landing gracefully on the 
other side. She kicked out straight behind her, nailing the wicked 
woman in the back. Hyphora shouted out as she writhed a bit from the 
deep cut on her back. She whipped around, a ball of energy sprinted 
towards Destiny. Smacking straight into her ribs. Universal Destiny 
looked unfazed by the attack and launched her own. 

&#147; Destiny Needle!&#148; The white light shot out of her pointed index 
finger. Hyphora moved swiftly to avoid the attack. It was faster 
though and cut at the crook of her neck. 

- I&#146;m bored with this. The others need to get back and soon.- 
Universal Destiny&#146;s dark silver wings were double the size of her 
other form&#146;s. She flew upward, holding out her hand. A black staff 
materialized, vine like carvings swirled around it, and a strobe sat 
on top as dark as the staff itself. 

&#147; Coran ti shi va ka!&#148; Hyphora turned very quiet, fear rising within 
her.

&#147; Mi tone quara tri mitamose!&#148; 

&#147; No! I will only do that on one condition&#133;&#148; 

&#147; Shora muy tienta. Tor se ja son qi fitazine.&#148; Universal Destiny 
glowed black, pointing her staff. 

&#147; Terrestria don&#146;t! Your in there I know! Endymion will forever be in 
this state.&#148; The strobe pulsed dangerously. 

&#147; Vi tian sha Gia dor win tai va seqe dinarie!&#148;
&#147; NO!&#148; Energy swirled around Hyphora like a cage. She began grabbing 
at her throat, fighting for oxygen. Her legs gave and she fell. 
Hyphora twitched for a few seconds then stopped moving all together. 
Her body faded away slowly until it was completely gone.

The staff disappeared and Universal Destiny floated to the ground. She 
landed next to Sailor Mars. Her own body glowed a soft black. A 
transparent form slipped from her. It took her form and stared at her.

&#147; Your body has adjusted to the power of Universal Destiny. 
Terrestrial is no longer needed and shall not appear again until the 
next generation of Senshi are ready. I too am no longer needed to 
sustain the power of the Universe. For now, my lovely daughter, good 
bye.&#148; The figure smiled lightly and floated away. 

&#147; Goodbye mother. Oh! My hair is gonna stay white??? Well can&#146;t think 
of that now.&#148; Destiny checked her beloved&#146;s breathing and quickly 
raced over to Sailor Moon.

&#147; Serenity? Wake up. Come on Sere!&#148; She smiled as the blonde&#146;s eyes 
opened groggily.

&#147; Oh, I feel horrible&#133;ack! Your hair!!! What happened?!&#148; Destiny 
giggled. 

&#147; Later, we&#146;ve gotta get back. The other&#146;s need major medical 
attention.&#148; The two sailor&#146;s hurriedly gathered their Senshi. Destiny 
carefully pulled Saturn out of the hole she was in high up the wall. 
She was bleeding, but not as badly as the others. 

- She looks so small. Hyphora deserved to die for what she had done.- 

&#147; Ready?&#148; She looked up from the unconscious girl she was holding to 
Serenity. In her arms was Endymion, the inner Senshi trailing behind 
her glowing white and pink as they floated along. The outers were 
behind her also, minus Hotaru who was in her arms. They left quickly 
through a portal and came out in the palace.
