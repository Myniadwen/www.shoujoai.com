<h1>Interregnum (part 1 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/desslok.html">Desslok</a><br> </h2>
<pre>[August 2002]

&quot;So what&#39;s this all about, Mina-chan?&quot; Makoto asked her friend as 
they met on the steps of the Hikawa Shrine.   

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; the young blonde answered, &quot;Usagi just said I 
needed to get over here right away.&quot;

&quot;Well, after you, my lady,&quot; Makoto said, waving her friend 
forward with a sweeping bow.  

With an amused giggle, Mina curtsied and then headed inside the 
temple.  Even though they had long since graduated high school, 
the sailor senshi still met quite regularly at the shrine.  It 
occurred to Mina that perhaps it was a bit strange that their 
lives were still so similar now as to how they had been back 
then.  &#39;Well, our lives were never normal to begin with,&#39; she 
mused.  

In the sitting room that served as the unofficial &quot;Sailor 
Headquarters&quot;, Mina and Mako found an annoyed Rei and an agitated 
Usagi waiting for them.  

&quot;Now will you tell us what this is all about, meatball head?&quot; Rei 
exclaimed.  

&quot;What about Ami?&quot; Mako asked, taking her traditional seat next to 
the place where Ami should have been.  

&quot;Ami&#39;s not coming,&quot; Usagi announced.  &quot;That&#39;s the problem.&quot;  As 
Mina and Rei got settled, Usagi pulled a small box out of her 
backpack.   &quot;I found this in my mailbox this morning.  It&#39;s from 
Ami.   The note said that I shouldn&#39;t watch it until we were all 
together.&quot;  Usagi tossed a piece of paper on the table, which Rei 
quickly grabbed and read aloud.

&quot;Dearest Usagi-chan, I know that I have rarely asked many favors 
of you, so I hope you will please do as I ask now.  Enclosed you 
will find a videotape.  Though I know you are very curious, 
please do not watch it until you are with Minako, Rei, and 
Makoto. It is meant for them as much as you.  I love you all very 
much. Ami.&quot;

&quot;What the hell?&quot; Makoto muttered, a look of annoyance forming on 
her face.

&quot;And you actually listened and didn&#39;t watch it?&quot; Minako asked 
Usagi incredulously.  

&quot;Yes! But I can&#39;t wait anymore!&quot;  Usagi quickly stuck the tape 
into the VCR and pushed the play button.  

----------

[The black screen suddenly comes to life.  The scene is Ami&#39;s 
computer room at her home.  Apparently, the camera rests on the 
desk, pointing at Ami who sits in her chair, her hands folded 
primly in her lap.  After a deep breath, Ami speaks.]

&quot;Hello.  First, I hope you will forgive me.  I don&#39;t usually like 
melodrama like this, but it was the only way I could conceive of 
to do what needed to be done.  You all know how difficult 
goodbyes are for me.  It was too hard to leave back in junior 
high and would only have been harder this time around.    
Fortunately, Chibi-Usa is not here this time to divulge my 
secrets and I can find my way to the airport without Mamoru&#39;s 
help.

&quot;As you will have guessed by now, I have left.  Knowing Usagi, 
you are watching this within an hour of when she found it, so as 
you sit, in the shrine most likely, I am on a jet bound for the 
United States.  I have been accepted into a year-long exchange 
program at Stanford University in San Francisco.  

&quot;I hope you will all understand why I have decided to say my 
farewells in a video, instead of in person.  You see, I&#39;ve come 
to the conclusion that it is really important for me to have some 
time away from Tokyo, away from Sailor Mercury, and, truthfully, 
away from all of you.

&quot;They say that you can&#39;t go home again, but I don&#39;t believe that.  
I think you can go home again, but that in order to do so, you 
must leave at some point.  Our lives have become stagnant.  We do 
the same things, have the same discussions, the same arguments, 
that we did a year ago, five years ago.  In order to grow, to 
gain the experiences we will all need to fulfill our duties in 
the future, we need some time to ourselves.  At least, I do.  I 
suspect that what is true for me is true for all of us, but 
perhaps that is not fair.

[A long pause, another deep breath, Ami&#39;s hands begin fidgeting 
in her lap.]

&quot;It was not easy to do this.  It is hard to keep secrets from 
those who know you better than you know yourself.  We are all so 
close.  True, some of the bonds between us are stronger than 
others.  However, even those ties which are not quite as strong 
as the others still go deeper than most people even realize is 
possible.  

&quot;Though I&#39;ve placed my life in your hands more times than I can 
count, though I would gladly give my own to save yours, though I 
love you beyond words, I am sorry, Mina-chan, that we have not 
had more time to spend together, just the two of us.  I hope to 
rectify that when we return.

&quot;Rei-chan, Usagi-chan, we&#39;ve been together since the very 
beginning and I don&#39;t know how I will manage without the two of 
you in my life.  That is exactly the reason that I must go.  I 
cannot be the person I will need to be if I am not confident in 
my ability to stand on my own.  I know you&#39;ll both understand.

[Ami reaches forward and the screen blinks for a moment.  After 
an apparent pause, Ami sits again in the same position, but her 
eyes are red and her face is flushed.  Her hands rub her forearms 
as if she is suddenly cold.  When she speaks, her voice 
trembles.]

&quot;I thought I could do this.  I really thought I could.  I had a 
plan.  I even wrote my little speech.  But, wouldn&#39;t that have 
been going against the very point of what I&#39;m doing?  Something 
had to give.  It took me a long time to realize what was going on 
with us.   Once I did realize, it took even longer to understand 
that things would never change unless something happened.  Right 
or wrong, I had to do something.  

[Tears silently fall down Ami&#39;s cheeks as she talks, her words 
rushing out in a torrent, as if she is afraid that if she stops 
speaking, she&#39;ll never be able to start again.]

&quot;You all know what I&#39;m talking about!  We all know each other too 
well not to know, but we all ignore it or pretend that we don&#39;t 
know or that no one else knows.  It&#39;s not healthy!  

&quot;Haven&#39;t you all wondered why Luna and Artemis don&#39;t spend much 
time with us anymore, why they decided to move in with Haruka and 
Michiru.  Watching it was killing them, just like it is killing 
us. I spoke with them.  They know.  They know other things too, 
but they wouldn&#39;t tell me.  Things about the Silver Millennium 
that they remember or maybe things from Crystal Tokyo that Diana 
told them before she left.  They said that we had to sort it out 
on our own.  They wouldn&#39;t say whether they approved of my plan 
or not, but they didn&#39;t try to stop me, so I hope I&#39;m doing the 
right thing.

[Finally, a break.  Another deep breath, taken in gasps as the 
tears continue to fall.  A pause to wipe eyes and sniffle into a 
tissue.  Ami seems to gather courage and then continues quickly.]

&quot;Mako-chan, I love you.  I&#39;ve loved you for a very long time now.  
Not the way that I love the rest.  You know what I mean.  You 
must.  You all know.  I&#39;m not that good an actress to keep the 
single most important thing in my life over the last few years 
hidden from my dearest friends.  It&#39;s funny, just admitting it 
makes it easier to go on.  I wasn&#39;t sure up till this moment 
whether or not I&#39;d have the courage to actually give you all 
this tape, but now I know I will.  I think I&#39;ve known on one 
level since the moment we first met, Mako-chan, but it took a 
long time for me to admit it to myself. 

&quot;So, that&#39;s the weight that borne me down over the years, but it 
isn&#39;t everything.  It all has to come out, so we can move on.  
Don&#39;t any of you dare to stop this tape.  I think you all know, 
deep inside, that it&#39;s time to clear the air.

&quot;Mako-chan, I&#39;ve never said anything to you of my feelings 
because I&#39;ve always known that you did not return them.  It isn&#39;t 
hard to see who holds your heart in her hands.  Mina-chan, you 
cannot have missed it.  You are the senshi of love, aren&#39;t you?  
Makoto loves you as much as you love Rei.  

[A mirthless laugh]

&quot;Ironic isn&#39;t it?  Maybe that curse on Minako filtered into all 
of us on one of those Sailor Teleports.  How better to ensure 
that none of us know love than to make us all love each other, 
but in the wrong order.  I love Makoto, Makoto loves Minako, 
Minako loves Rei.   We all know who Rei loves.  

&quot;Oh Usagi-chan, I know that you&#39;ve always hoped Rei would grow 
out of it.  Maybe on a deep level, you enjoy having her love.  
Maybe you return it to some degree, though I&#39;ve never doubted 
that your truest love will always be Mamoru.  Don&#39;t you see, 
though, nothing will change simply by waiting, because we all 
have centuries to wait.  Rei pines for you, Mina pines for her 
and so on down the line to me.  I guess it would be fitting if 
Mamoru had a crush on me, but I&#39;ve never seen any evidence of 
that.  I guess that makes me the low woman on the totem pole.

&quot;I&#39;m not trying to garner sympathy though.  If there&#39;s one thing 
that&#39;s clear, it&#39;s that we&#39;ve all suffered enough.  Like I said 
before, something has to give.  We all deserve love.  Once, I 
asked Luna if all of Serenity&#39;s handmaidens were doomed to 
loveless lives, so they wouldn&#39;t be distracted from their duties.  
She told me I was being foolish, but wouldn&#39;t say anything more 
on the topic.  That gives me some hope.  Maybe we are allowed to 
have love, to be happy outside of our duties.  I&#39;m hoping that by 
doing this, I will enable that for at least some of us.  

&quot;For me, well, I will have my studies.  I can&#39;t imagine anything 
that would ever turn my heart from Kino Makoto, but hopefully 
distance will dull the pain.  I am used to losing myself in books 
and in work.  

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to drop this on you and then leave.  It&#39;s not very 
fair, but it&#39;s all I could think to do.  I&#39;m so sorry.  I love 
you all so much.  Please don&#39;t hate me.  I will email you all 
with my new contact information.  I hope to hear from you, but I 
guess I will understand if I do not.  

[Ami falls silent.  From time to time, it seems she has something 
more to say, but she never does.  After 2 excruciating minutes, 
she simply stands and shuts off the recording.   Black screen.]

----------------

The long silence in which the senshi had watched Ami&#39;s video 
lingered for some time after the video stopped.  No one moved to 
shut off the VCR.   No one commented.   Finally, a loud click 
indicated that the tape had reached an end.  It rang through the 
room like a gunshot and broke the spell.

&quot;Fuck Ami!&quot; Makoto growled, leaping to her feet.  &quot;Fuck her!  
Cowardly bitch!&quot;   As her friends stared at her aghast, Mako 
stormed out of the temple. 

In the wake of Makoto&#39;s departure, Rei stood silently and strode 
from the room without a word to anyone.  Minako and Usagi heard 
several doors sliding down the hallway.   Apparently, Rei had 
left the building.

Minako and Usagi simply stared at each other, unsure of what to 
say or what to do next.
