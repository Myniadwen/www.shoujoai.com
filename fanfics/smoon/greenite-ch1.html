fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Another story, you say? About the Senshi and battles with giants and 
magic? You don&#39;t want much, do you?

Well&#133;maybe I do have story for you after all. Gather around and mind 
me now. Because this story takes place in a time that is not of this 
time and a place that is not of this place, in a land full of wonder 
and beauty and magic. It takes placer in Crystal Tokyo.

You remember the story I told you last time? The story of Kuroko, the 
kitchen girl who turned out to be the powerful Sailor Saturn and how 
she rescued the Moon Kingdom? Well, this story takes place the very 
*next* year.

It was Christmas time once again in Crystal Tokyo. Christmas was 
always a festive time and a blinding one too, when the sun was bright. 
The Crystal palace gleamed in the white winter light, and to make it 
even more beautiful than ever, banners and garlands hung from every 
surface, flashing and twinkling by sun and moon.

Once again the great ones of Crystal Tokyo were gathered. All the 
talent and brains and beauty of the city (by which I mean mostly 
everyone) were poised to gather together and salute their Great Queen 
at her solstice feast. And the Queen, as always, was greatly looking 
forward to her party. It was no secret you see, that the Queen loved 
an adventure. As she had proclaimed the year before, no food would be 
set before the guests until a tale had been told, or a quest had been 
proposed &#150; or some enchanted creature had made itself known to the 
company.

The first year, you may remember, that Neo-Queen Serenity had made 
this pronouncement the reaction had been one of trepidation &#150; but not 
this year. This year the whole city waited breathlessly for the magic 
of the season to bring them a great adventure.

So the day came and the city flowed through the gates of the Palace 
once again, and the greathearts of the court mingled with the people 
they protected. This year the Queen had commanded all the Senshi be 
present; her own daughter and Sailor Saturn gracefully welcomed guests 
into the dining room. Sailors Uranus and Neptune, who were known to 
keep to themselves, were there; and there was great wonder at them &#150; 
for they were not often seen by the people of Crystal Tokyo. But the 
crowd swirled strongly around the figures of the Inner Senshi &#150; the 
Queen&#39;s own advisors and protectors. They *were* well known and had 
many friends and loved ones among the guests. Even the mysterious 
Sailor Pluto came from her place at the Doors of Time, since the Queen 
herself had insisted.

Soon, but not soon enough, the time came for the guests to take their 
seats. Once again the Queen with the King and her Senshi at her side, 
were seated at the high dais and looked out upon the gathered company.

The Queen sat, and all took their seats. She smiled at the room and 
many smiled back at her. &quot;I bid you all welcome,&quot; she began in her 
soft voice, &quot;to Our Christmas party. As you are well aware, last year 
We made it Our custom to require a tale or miracle&#133;or mystical event, 
before We will eat.&quot; Her smile brightened. &quot;We have been told that 
this has added to the popularity of this event somewhat.&quot;

The company chuckled &#150; it was well-known that everyone who could have 
possibly wangled an invitation that year had done so &#150; and indeed, the 
hall was filled to bursting point with attentive visitors.

&quot;So,&quot; the Queen continued. &quot;Does anyone have for Us, a tale? A quest? 
A challenge?&quot; On the last word, the Queen&#39;s voice rang out and almost 
echoed across the hall. When the sound had faded away there was 
nothing but a pregnant silence. No one dared breathe, much less move.

The silence lengthened. Not a sound, not as much as a sneeze came from 
the gathering. And still the silence went on. The Senshi, attentive to 
the moods of their sovereign, watched the Queen&#39;s face, waiting for a 
sign of her pleasure &#150; or displeasure. Later it was said that the 
Senshi, knowing their Queen so well and knowing her sense of humor, 
were waiting for, as they say, the other boot to drop.

And drop it did. Into the middle of that silence came a loud booming 
noise. After the echoes had faded, it came again, then a third time. 
The Queen nodded to the servants at the doors, and they were swung 
open. It wasn&#39;t until this moment that the company realized that what 
they had heard was the knocking of a very large fist upon the palace 
doors.

In a great sigh of released breaths, the guests turned to face the 
apparition that rode into the dining hall. A giant it was, and all of 
green, so that clothes and eyes and even its skin glowed emerald. It 
rode in upon an enormous horse, with mane and tail the same virulent 
color and great green hooves that clacked loudly upon the floor. The 
giant held in its huge fist an axe &#150; an axe as large as a person &#150; as 
easily as a child might lift a pencil. It was clad from head to toe in 
green armor. The company stared with wide eyes at this creature. 
People pressed away from the green giant, leaving room for it to ride 
into the center of the room, and to turn and face the Queen.

As the creature came to a halt in front of the Court, the horse 
lowered its head, as if in curtsey. The Queen acknowledged this with a 
nod and a new smile. 

&quot;Welcome Guest, to Our home. I take it you have a tale for us?&quot;

The giant did not answer. Instead, it lifted itself easily from the 
saddle and dismounted to stand in front of the Queen. Bowing deeply, 
the creature reached up and removed the helmet that shielded its head. 
As the helm was removed, the guests were surprised to note that the 
giant creature had long green hair that fell almost to the ground. And 
when it spoke, all listeners were enthralled. The creature, armored, 
with great weapon indeed, was a woman!

&quot;Great Queen,&quot; the giantess&#39; voice boomed across the hall, &quot;I salute 
you.&quot; And she did, sweeping her arm and the great axe she held, across 
her body with an audible &quot;swoop.&quot; &quot;I have come to your court to look 
upon the renowned Senshi at last with my own eyes.&quot;

Standing at her full height, the Giant was able to look the raised 
Senshi in the eyes. Her smile, when it came, was pearly green.

&quot;And I see that you are, as I have heard, wise and powerful and the 
Senshi are strong and brave. So I have come to test that strength and 
bravery &#150; I have come with a challenge.&quot;

Again the words echoed. This time the tongues of the guests were 
loosened, and the buzz of whisper and conjecture moved faster than the 
wind through the crowd.

&quot;A challenge,&quot; Neo-Queen Serenity echoed. &quot;I am glad. I was getting 
quite hungry.&quot; There was a noise of choked laughter, but none of the 
Senshi&#39;s faces changed and no one knew from whom it had come.

&quot;I have a simple challenge and one that will not be cause for too much 
alarm,&quot; the giantess said pleasantly. &quot;I have brought with me an axe, 
as you see,&quot; here she held up the object high so that everyone in the 
room could see it &#150; a not difficult task, as it was now almost 
brushing the ceiling with its eerily glowing patina. &quot;And I challenge 
one of your Senshi to strike me with it. A single blow, strong and 
sure enough to remove my head from my shoulders.&quot;

Again the crowd was filled with whispered conversation. A beheading? 
Before dinner?

&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound like too difficult a challenge,&quot; the Queen 
commented lightly. &quot;Surely there is some greater task involved?&quot;

&quot;A greater task that removing my head?&quot; the giantess laughed at this. 
&quot;Yes, there is. For the Senshi that undertakes this challenge will be 
allowed but one stroke. And one year and day from today, that same 
Senshi must seek me out and receive in return a single stroke from 
this same axe.&quot;

Now the crowd no longer whispered, but spoke in outright concern. 
Would anyone be foolish to accept this challenge? It was surely death!

But the Queen did nothing. Without even turning her head, she spoke to 
her Senshi. &quot;Which one of you will address this challenge?&quot; And in an 
instant every Senshi was on her feet shouting that she and no other 
would be the one to accept the offer. The Queen smiled and turned her 
head from side to side. 

&quot;I think that only one of you is meant for this task.&quot; The Queen&#39;s 
voice pierced the crowd&#39;s clamor and everyone stood silent.

Sailor Mars spoke sharply. &quot;I am the Queen&#39;s Champion &#150; it falls to me 
to take up this quest.&quot;

Sailor Uranus spoke firmly. &quot;I am the best fighter. I will do this.&quot;

The Queen shook her head slowly. &quot;Neither to Mars nor to Uranus, I 
think, will this challenge go.&quot;

Sailor Mercury spoke up. &quot;I believe that this challenge was designed 
specifically for one of us alone, was it not, Green Knight?&quot;

The giantess nodded somberly as all the Senshi stepped back and took 
their seats.

Except one.

Sailor Jupiter still stood, and leaning forward, her hands on the 
table in front of her she said firmly, &quot;This contest is mine &#150; and I 
accept it.&quot;

Once again the Queen smiled and the Senshi smiled too &#150; all but Sailor 
Jupiter, whose face remained serious and thoughtful.

&quot;Let&#39;s do this thing, Green Knight, so that you may die your death and 
I may get my dinner.&quot; And at this, she smiled.

Sailor Jupiter left the high dais, and walked proudly to the floor 
where giant knight and horse waited. Both stood many feet taller than 
she &#150; and she was one of the tallest of the Senshi. 

The knight regarded her solemnly. &quot;You swear that you will abide by 
this agreement and seek me out one year and a day from today?&quot;

&quot;I do,&quot; responded Jupiter.

&quot;And you will accept without regard for your own life a single stroke 
from this axe?&quot;

&quot;I will.&quot;

The giantess nodded and held out the axe. Sailor Jupiter grasped the 
enormous weapon in both hands. It was plain to all who watched that 
the Senshi, strong as she was, was hard put to maneuver the immense 
thing. After a moment or two, Sailor Jupiter got the weight and heft 
of it, and nodded. &quot;I&#39;m ready.&quot;

The knight bent her knee and lowered herself down until Sailor Jupiter 
could look her in the eye. &quot;You may wish to stand on something,&quot; she 
said mildly.

Jupiter nodded. Looking around, she asked that a table be cleared and 
it was done. Jumping to the table, she nodded once again. The knight 
kneeled before her, pushed her hair out of the way and waited.

Sailor Jupiter swung the huge axe in a large arc around her head. The 
humming of the weapon through the air was audible to everyone in the 
hall. With a grunt of effort and a single swing that took all of her 
strength, Sailor Jupiter aimed the axe for the giantess&#39; great, green 
neck. The axe cut cleanly through and the head rolled to the floor 
with a thump, followed by the body of the enchanted knight.

People throughout the hall began to scream, but the Queen simply 
raised her hand. &quot;Watch,&quot; she instructed, and the crowd immediately 
calmed down.

The great body of the giantess shuddered and lifted itself to its 
hands and knees. Feeling around gently, it found its own head and 
dusted it off. With a pronounced effort, it placed its own head firmly 
onto its own shoulders. Removing its hands, it rolled its head around 
a little before turning to face a pale and visibly shaking Sailor 
Jupiter.

&quot;Be at ease, brave Senshi &#150; I live. That was indeed a mighty blow. I 
will have a headache I fear, for many days.&quot; The giantess stood and 
plucked her axe lightly from Jupiter&#39;s clenched hands. &quot;Remember your 
promise &#150; one year and a day from today I will expect you in the Green 
Grotto. Come and receive your blow, Senshi of Crystal Tokyo!&quot; And with 
that, the phantasmic creature swung herself up into the saddle and 
rode out of the hall before anyone could speak another word.

Sailor Jupiter, still a little wan, rejoined her companions at the 
head table. The Queen stood and commanded that the dinner be served, 
but it was doubtful that anyone ate much, with all the talking that 
was going on.

 

***

Spring came to Crystal Tokyo and the cherry trees flowered, much as 
they do even now. Then spring passed and summer too, and one day as 
the Queen looked out onto her beautiful city, she noticed that autumn 
had come. The weather was still warm, but the leaves were beginning to 
change and winter would not be long off. There was a knock at the door 
of her chamber and she called out for the person to come in and join 
her.

Sailor Jupiter stepped in and bowed. The young woman&#39;s face was 
serious, but her green eyes twinkled. &quot;It looks like it&#39;s time for me 
to fulfill my quest,&quot; she said lightly.

The Queen agreed. &quot;I wondered when you would set out. I&#39;ve had some 
things prepared for you.&quot;

The Senshi gathered to say farewell to their companion. Sailor Jupiter 
was arrayed with the finest armor and weaponry that Crystal Tokyo had, 
but she shook her head. &quot;You know I won&#39;t use any of these things. Why 
are you giving them to me?&quot;

The Queen grinned in a way that only her closest friends might have 
remembered from her youth. &quot;You need them &#150; it&#39;s part of the story.&quot; 
Only Sailor Mercury smiled at this, but she remained silent.

Sailor Jupiter looked contemplatively at the golden star on her new 
cloak and shield and she shrugged. &quot;I&#39;ll come back before spring, I 
promise.&quot; And with a wave, she sped off to find the mysterious Green 
Knight.

Sailor Jupiter traveled far and wide searching for the magical green 
giantess and her grotto. Most had never heard of such a thing, but 
once in a while, she was given directions towards the west. Always 
towards the west, and so west she traveled, all the way through autumn 
until long after the weather turned cold and all the leaves had fallen 
from the trees. 

It was a hard journey and a long one. The land became wild and the 
people unfriendly. Some, when they heard that a Senshi of Crystal 
Tokyo was among them, hid in their homes and locked the doors. Others 
lined the streets of their town, watching closely as Sailor Jupiter 
passed through, but offering no assistance.

One day, as the sun was setting and the cold dark began to gnaw into 
Sailor Jupiter&#39;s bones, she became aware of a small house ahead. Light 
poured from the windows warmly and there was a sense of something 
welcome and cozy in that place. She could make out a garden that had 
been well-tended, a path cleared of weeds and a sense of loneliness 
began to overwhelm her. She knocked on the door hoping that she might 
find at least a place to stay for the night, but maybe also a 
companion &#150; someone with whom to share her tale.

The woman who answered the door was old, wrinkled, with a kindly face. 
She took a long look at the Senshi, then commanded her to come in out 
of the cold. Jupiter did so with dispatch. The woman welcomed her in, 
sat her down and before you could say two words, she found herself 
with warm feet and a full stomach. That the woman did not ask who she 
was, or where she was going or why, struck Jupiter as odd, but there 
was no polite way to mention it.

After thanking the old woman, Sailor Jupiter waited until she had 
picked up her knitting and set herself by the fire. &quot;Have you ever 
heard of the Green Grotto?&quot; she asked, &quot;I have an appointment there 
and I don&#39;t know where to find it.&quot;

The old lady stared at her with dark eyes flashing. &quot;I won&#39;t ask your 
business, but I&#39;ve never heard of anything good happening there.&quot;

&quot;So you* have* heard of it?&quot; Jupiter leaned forward eagerly.

&quot;Yes, it&#39;s not far off. But there&#39;s a guardian there &#150; you won&#39;t pass 
her.&quot;

&quot;The Green Knight!&quot; Jupiter said, jumping to her feet. &quot;That&#39;s who I 
have business with &#150; where is it? Is it far?&quot;

The old lady shooed Jupiter back into her chair. &quot;It&#39;s not far, you 
can make it there in less than a day.&quot; She pinned Jupiter with her 
dark eyes. &quot;But think hard, young lady, before you leave here. Here is 
warmth and light and food. At the grotto you will find only cold and 
dark and death.&quot;

Sailor Jupiter sat quietly for a moment, then said, &quot;If that is my 
destiny, then so be it. I gave my word and I&#39;ll see this though.&quot;

The old lady nodded. &quot;Then sleep here tonight and tomorrow I&#39;ll set 
you on your road.&quot;

The Senshi slept deeply that night and woke refreshed and happy. 
Although the adventure ahead seemed dark, she could not stop smiling, 
and at last, as she helped the old woman prepare breakfast, burst out 
into a song.

They ate together, and the old lady watched while Jupiter gathered her 
few possessions and made ready to go.

&quot;Follow the path that goes towards the forest, towards the west. When 
you reach a fork in the road, take the left path &#150; that will lead you 
to the Green Grotto,&quot; the old lady said. &quot;The way won&#39;t be easy, no 
one goes that way. But,&quot; and the lady smiled at Sailor Jupiter, 
&quot;you&#39;re young, strong and, dare I say, dedicated, it probably won&#39;t 
stop you.&quot;

Jupiter laughed. &quot;Dedicated? You mean foolish. Well, thank you for 
everything!&quot; And she took her leave of the old woman.

She was out of sight of the house when she realized that she had 
forgotten to ask the woman her name; for Jupiter was a kind person, 
and had determined to send a reward or thanks offering when she 
returned to Crystal Tokyo. She turned back on her trail and once more 
came within sight of the cottage. But this time there was no light 
coming from the windows and the garden looked weedy and over-run. 
Calling out for the old lady, Jupiter was unable to see any sign of 
life &#150; or that anyone had inhabited this cottage for a very, very long 
time. In confusion, Jupiter turned away from the abandoned shack and 
headed into the forest.

The forest was dense and dark. Strange noises followed Jupiter as she 
walked. Rustling movements on each side told her that she was being 
watched. But no enemy dared show itself. Jupiter whistled, hummed, 
then sang loudly to bolster her confidence, but the sound died in the 
dank air. At last she came to a fork in the road. The noises that had 
been soft but persistent now grew louder &#150; calls and cries filled the 
air and she covered her ears against them. Keeping her eyes fixed on 
the road ahead, Jupiter took the left way at a run.

As she passed the signpost, which only pointed the way to the right, 
the noises &#150; all of them &#150; ceased.

The only sound she could here now was her breathing and the sound of 
her feet moving through the underbrush. The path was hard to see, 
overgrown as it was, and Sailor Jupiter had to clear the way with her 
arms. Bushes and trees tore at her face and clothes, and soon she 
despaired of her way, for she had completely lost the path. No sun 
broke through the dense forest and she was beginning to tire. As the 
thought passed through her mind that she would pause at the first 
clearing she found, the forest seemed to open up into a wide and 
sunlit glade.

Sailor Jupiter stood amazed. Soft, warm sun poured onto green grass. 
Trees flowered and animals moved across the sward, as if she had 
wandered into a place caught in an eternal springtime. At the top of a 
small rise she spotted a manor house. The sun gleamed on polished 
timber and she could hear laughter. Slowly, she approached the house, 
willing that the enchanter be friendly and not set against her.

The first human that greeted the tired Senshi&#39;s eyes was an incredible 
sight. A young woman stood in the grass, laughing and singing as if 
she has no other task for the day. Sailor Jupiter watched in 
fascination as the woman twirled and danced in the flower-covered 
meadow.

The young woman stopped when she saw the Senshi watching her and her 
face immediately turned red. &quot;I&#39;m sorry!&quot; she cried, running to meet 
the weary visitor, &quot;I didn&#39;t see you there. Welcome to Greenlawn. 
Please come in and rest yourself.&quot;

Sailor Jupiter introduced herself with a formal bow. &quot;I&#39;m here on 
official business,&quot; she said by way of explanation, &quot;I won&#39;t be here 
long.&quot;

But the young woman had taken Jupiter&#39;s hands in her own and pulled 
her towards the house. &quot;I don&#39;t know what business could have brought 
you out to my home &#150; it&#39;s hardly on the beaten track.&quot; She laughed 
joyfully at her own joke. &quot;But you&#39;re very welcome! I rarely have 
visitors at all, much less so distinguished a visitor from the 
capitol.&quot;

The young woman led Jupiter into the house, and made her feel at home. 
&quot;There is a bath, and food, and if you will allow me to be 
presumptuous, a bed you can sleep in.&quot;

Jupiter nodded with thanks. &quot;I&#39;m exceedingly grateful for the bath and 
the meal, but I have an errand to run, so despite my desire to stay in 
your beautiful home, I&#39;ll have to leave in the morning.&quot;

&quot;How awful!&quot; the woman said, &quot;and here I thought I might be have some 
company for a few days.&quot; A look of sudden shame passed over her fair 
face and she blushed. &quot;In my haste to welcome you, I&#39;ve forgotten to 
introduce myself &#150; I&#39;m Lii.&quot;

&quot;Lii,&quot; Sailor Jupiter parroted politely. &quot;And please, call me Makoto.&quot;

&quot;Makoto then.&quot; And for the first time, Jupiter noticed that her 
hostess had a slight accent, marking her as a foreigner.

***

The Senshi had made herself comfortable, bathing and changing into 
clean clothes provided by Lii. As she joined her hostess, Sailor 
Jupiter jested that she now understood why Lii had been spinning in 
place when they had met, the clothes felt so soft.

A meal was served and over it, the two women spoke lightly, of general 
things, music and dance and clothes and parties, as young women will 
do (even though, as Senshi of Crystal Tokyo, Jupiter was far older 
than she appeared.)

When the dishes were cleared and both women were again comfortable, 
Lii at last admitted that she could wait no longer &#150; she *must* know 
what quest took a Senshi of renown so far away from her home.

&quot;I am looking for the Green Grotto,&quot; Jupiter confessed, somewhat 
wearily. &quot;I have an appointment in four days with the Green Knight 
that dwells there &#150; an appointment I may not miss.&quot;

&quot;But that&#39;s right down the hill!&quot; Lii cried happily. &quot;You can remain 
here and keep me company for the days remaining, and on the fourth 
morning, I shall see you off myself.&quot;

With great relief, Sailor Jupiter agreed.

The night passed in pleasant conversation, ending in both women 
wishing each other pleasant dreams.

***

The morning dawned brightly, as indeed, Lii commented, it did most 
days, and the women met again over breakfast. Jupiter was so happy to 
not have to journey another day that she offered her assistance with 
the house, or any chore that might present itself. Lii looked 
thoughtful at this.

&quot;I can&#39;t think of anything I need from you, except your company,&quot; she 
said. &quot;And sadly, this morning I have some business away from here. It 
won&#39;t take long, I&#39;ll be back before the sun starts towards the west.&quot; 
Her face brightened, &quot;I propose a game! My business can, if you are so 
inclined, be called hunting. I will give you all that I bring back 
with me as a gift. While I am away, you have your run of all the 
grounds &#150; and anything that you gain, you shall give to me!&quot;

Jupiter laughed at that. &quot;I can&#39;t imagine what I could find of 
interest in your own home, but I&#39;ll agree to the terms.&quot;

Lii clapped her hands in delight. &quot;Then it&#39;s a deal. I&#39;ll return about 
noon. Please feel free to go where you will.&quot;

Lii left soon after, and Sailor Jupiter decided that it would be only 
fair to go about and hunt for unusual things, as the terms of the game 
dictated. She wandered the halls of the beautiful manor, visiting 
every room in turn, picking up books, looking at the art and generally 
poking around. As the hours passed, Jupiter found herself on the top 
floor of the home, in what was obviously being used as a storage room. 
She swung the door closed behind her, but instead of closing, the door 
slapped into the slightly warped frame with a loud bang.

Jupiter turned with a start, as another voice cried out in surprise. 
Jupiter found herself staring at a pair of large green eyes that 
stared back rather wildly. Jupiter apologized quickly, then expressed 
surprise that there was anyone else at all in the house.

&quot;Oh, well,&quot; the woman laughed shyly. &quot;I don&#39;t go downstairs much. I 
stay in my rooms and study, mostly.&quot;

Jupiter smiled gently. &quot;You remind me of a friend.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; The woman gazed at the Senshi in wonder. &quot;A friend of 
yours?&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot; Jupiter laughed. &quot;Does it surprise you that I have friends?&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; the woman blushed deeply. &quot;It&#39;s just that my sister told me that 
you are from the Palace in Crystal Tokyo, and since you are so 
powerful and famous...it is somewhat surprising to hear you speak of 
friends.&quot;

&quot;Your sister?&quot; 


&quot;Yes, I&#39;m Ran, Lii&#39;s sister.&quot; The woman turned away quickly.

&quot;Can I offer any assistance?&quot; the Senshi asked. &quot;In return for 
startling you.&quot;

Ran gestured to a large pile of books. &quot;You can help me carry these. 
If you don&#39;t mind.&quot;

Jupiter jumped forward to lift the burden into her arms. &quot;I don&#39;t mind 
at all.&quot; And she smiled into Ran&#39;s eyes. Jupiter noticed, as she now 
stood less than an arm&#39;s length from Roan, that the other woman, 
although short-haired, where Lii had long, was otherwise very similar 
to her sister. They were of a height and of the same build, and their 
eyes were the same shade of green &#150; as green as the grass in the mead 
outside. And as the other thanked her, Jupiter heard that their voices 
too were similar &#150; each with that same small accent.

Jupiter carried her burden, following as Ran led the way to a distant 
wing of the house. Carefully, Ran unlocked a door and opened it, 
waving the Senshi in. The rooms were pleasant, airy and bright, she 
noted, just before a dark object came hurtling out of nowhere and 
knocked Jupiter and the tomes she held to the floor.

Ran scurried forward with an exclamation and kneeled before the 
groaning Senshi. &quot;I&#39;m sorry! Are you alright? You&#39;re not injured are 
you?&quot;

Jupiter stilled her dizziness and looked up at Ran&#39;s concerned face. 
&quot;I&#39;m fine, but...what was that?&quot;

The other woman blushed yet again. &quot;It was my cat &#150; we must have 
startled it. But your hand,&quot; Ran exclaimed, picking up the appendage 
as she spoke. &quot;It&#39;s been cut.&quot;

Jupiter sat on the floor and stared at her own hand. &quot;It&#39;s only a 
little wound. Nothing to worry about.&quot;

&quot;Let me bandage it for you,&quot; Ran insisted. She hurried away, returning 
with a cloth, with which she preceded to cover the wound. After it was 
done, she lingered, holding the hand still.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jupiter said graciously, remembering an episode from her 
own youth that was not dissimilar.

&quot;There&#39;s something missing,&quot; Ran insisted, her face now a dark 
crimson. &quot;This will help you heal faster,&quot; and she leaned forward and 
pressed a long kiss onto the back of Jupiter&#39;s hand. The Senshi sat, 
quite paralyzed with amazement at this act. Ran stood up quickly and 
began to straighten the books that had spilled across the floor. &quot;You 
should go,&quot; Ran said. &quot;My sister will be returning shortly.&quot;

Jupiter stood and tried to assist Ran, but the other woman shooed her 
away with that shy smile. &quot;Go. But if you should happen to be in the 
garden tomorrow morning, then look for me - I may be there.&quot;

Jupiter left Ran&#39;s apartment and returned to the main part of the 
house, feeling decidedly bewildered. On the one hand the woman seemed 
so bashful and quiet, but that kiss...she resolved that it was nothing 
about which to worry, but the memory made her thoughtful.

Ran was correct &#150; Lii returned not long after. She was smiling and gay 
and full of laughter as she rant to meet her guest. &quot;Let&#39;s have our 
meal right away and we shall share our treasures from today&#39;s hunt 
afterwards.&quot;

And so they did. It was early afternoon when they at last made ready 
to share their adventures. Lii brought forth, with great fanfare, a 
large covered basket. From the basket she drew a fragrant posy, all of 
spring flowers. This she gave to Jupiter with a flourish. 

&quot;This is for you, as we promised.&quot; The woman laughed lightly as she 
handed Jupiter flowers and herbs and wild vegetables of many kinds. 
Jupiter&#39;s face was alight with wonder as Lii produced from her great 
basket, well out of season, sweet potatoes and other root vegetables. 
&quot;And because these are your part of today&#39;s exchange,&quot; Lii smiled, &quot;we 
shall have them with our dinner! Now, it is your turn &#150; what have you 
for me?&quot;

Jupiter shook her head. &quot;I think I failed in my side &#150; I have nothing 
I received today, except...&quot; and here she paused for a moment, &quot;unless 
it be this.&quot; And she caught up Lii&#39;s hand in her own and pressed her 
lips firmly to the back.

When Jupiter released the other&#39;s hand, there was a stark silence, but 
Lii&#39;s laughter filled it a moment later. &quot;I won&#39;t ask you where you 
found this thing, it would ruin the mystery. Now, let us walk in the 
sunlight and enjoy the air.&quot;

And so the day passed into night, the two women growing ever more 
comfortable with the other&#39;s presence. The next morning came, much the 
same as the one before. Lii once again proclaimed her business would 
take her away from the house, but that upon her return they would once 
again exchange what they had won from their labors.

After Lii had left, Jupiter remembered Ran&#39;s words and took herself 
out to the garden. For hours she wandered the paths, lost in thought 
and in the beauty of the place. It was in the shade of a large tree 
that that grew beside the stream that she once again found Ran. The 
woman rose to her feet with a greeting and held out her hands to 
welcome the Senshi. 


&quot;I am glad that you came&quot; Ran said, and leaned forward, placing two 
soft kisses, one on each of Jupiter&#39;s cheeks. She bade Jupiter sit 
with her and together they sat in comfortable silence, dabbling their 
feet in the water. Jupiter made a few passes at conversation, but by 
and large was content merely to be in the other&#39;s presence. Indeed, it 
seemed to her that Ran was as quiet and soothing as Lii was full of 
energy. Almost as if she had read the Senshi&#39;s thoughts, Ran leapt to 
her feet. 

&quot;I must be going,&quot; she said, &quot;but my sister will be here shortly and 
you can give her what I have given you.&quot; Her smile was warm, and her 
green eyes flickered with laughter &#150; almost exactly as Lii&#39;s did. She 
took her leave and was gone before Jupiter could say another word.

That evening, Lii brought out her basket once again. &quot;Today I bring 
you great riches!&quot; she said with joy. The basket gave forth of its 
bounty &#150; apples and pears and best of all, fresh, golden peaches. 
Jupiter boggled at the fruit, and almost without will of her own 
insisted that she make a pie for them to share.

&quot;A pie?&quot; Lii clapped her hands, as was her wont. &quot;And so shall it be! 
But you must turn your treasures over to me.&quot;

Jupiter laughed. &quot;I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll find my take today poor indeed.&quot; 
She stood to face Lii, and put her hands on the other woman&#39;s 
shoulders. A kiss she placed on each of Lii&#39;s cheeks, which were 
decidedly pinker when the Senshi moved away from her.

&quot;How very interesting a hunt you must have had...&quot; was Lii&#39;s only 
comment, her voice hushed.

Another evening passed. An observer might have noticed that, from time 
to time, when the Senshi&#39;s eyes were turned away, Lii turned a hard 
and penetrating look upon her.

The third morning dawned and Lii commented, somewhat reluctantly, that 
she would not be home before noon once again. Her leave-taking was 
somewhat subdued and Sailor Jupiter did not fail to notice.

Today she had no plans, but merely wandered where she would, and 
finding that she longed to breath the air of the meadow, went outside 
to stroll on the lawn. The manor was well named, for the knoll was 
green and bright and the sun was warm on her back. From where she 
stood, Sailor Jupiter could see for miles, down the hill on one side 
to the forest from which she had come, and to the other, a dark and 
ill-boding wood, with impenetrable foliage. Jupiter shuddered at the 
sight and turned to leave. It was her turn to be startled this time, 
as she nearly ran into Ran, who stood close behind her.

&quot;It&#39;s terrifying, isn&#39;t it?&quot; the woman nearly whispered. &quot;But tomorrow 
you go that way.&quot;

Jupiter turned back towards the dark wood and nodded. &quot;I have a 
promise I must keep.&quot;

Ran sighed. &quot;And I will never see you again.&quot; Her voice was sad, but 
something in her seemed determined. She sighed again. &quot;In which 
case...&quot; with a quick movement, Ran embraced Jupiter strongly, 
pressing her lips against those of the surprised Senshi. &quot;I wish you 
would not go,&quot; she whispered, and kissed Jupiter more deeply and 
passionately than the Senshi had ever felt. Her own head became dizzy, 
her breath shortened and reflexively she felt her arms tighten about 
the waist of the slight woman. The kiss went on for a long time, 
before she was released. 

Ran stepped back, her face once again flushed, her lips dark and she 
looked up at the tall Senshi. Her eyes filled with tears. &quot;I can&#39;t 
persuade you can I? To stay here?&quot;

Sadly Jupiter shook her head.

Ran nodded sadly. &quot;Then at least take this,&quot; she undid from around her 
waist a belt, woven green and gold threads. &quot;It has a spell of 
protection within it. Anyone who wears this shall not be killed, even 
by the sharpest of blades or strongest of blows.&quot; Ran handed over the 
girdle. &quot;Tell me that you will wear this tomorrow when you face the 
Green Knight.&quot;

Jupiter looked down at the object. Her vow to the Green Knight coursed 
through her mind. &quot;I cannot,&quot; she said, at last. &quot;I swore that I would 
accept this blow without regard for my life.&quot;

Ran took Jupiter&#39;s hand and laid the girdle on her palm. &quot;Not for 
yourself, but for myself do I ask this. I do not wish you to die.&quot; 
Tears welled up in the woman&#39;s eyes and Jupiter found her fist closing 
over the belt.

&quot;I&#39;ll wear it,&quot; the Senshi said, &quot;where no one might see it. If it 
protects me, then so be it.&quot; And with these words, she felt something 
akin to relief &#150; for the Green Knight might be strong, but she might 
yet live to see the sun rise in two days.

Ran again embraced her happily. &quot;I will not see you off. I wish you 
protection and joy, great Senshi.&quot; The woman dashed the tears from her 
eyes and sprang away across the lawn as lightly as her sister danced 
on that same spot.

Jupiter stood a long time staring off after Ran. At last she stirred, 
and with a quick glance around to see that she was not watched, she 
slipped the girdle on beneath her clothes and tied it around her 
waist. Thus protected, she headed back to the house.

Lii arrived home, this time bearing with her eggs and cheese. Her mien 
was serious and reserved and Jupiter worried.

&quot;Gracious hostess,&quot; the Senshi said, &quot;tell me what troubles you.&quot;

At these words Lii put on a smile, though it was obviously false. &quot;I&#39;m 
troubled by your leaving. Although it&#39;s been but three days, I feel as 
if you have been here forever...and it makes me sad to think that I 
shall never see you again.&quot;

&quot;So hopeful!&quot; Jupiter laughed. &quot;I do not fear the Green Knight, nor 
should you. I promise that you will see me ere the sunset tomorrow.&quot;

Lii looked hard at the Senshi. &quot;You can promise me that?&quot;

Sailor Jupiter nodded. &quot;I vow it.&quot;

Lii&#39;s face relaxed into a true smile. But when she turned away, 
Jupiter&#39;s hand rested on her waist where the girdle was tied.

Night had fallen. The two women sat together on a soft couch, the 
silence lengthening between them.

Of a sudden Jupiter sat bolt upright. &quot;I have completely forgotten my 
end of the bargain!&quot; she cried. &quot;You gave me your days spoils, but I 
have not given you mine.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Lii asked. &quot;And what did the great hunter receive today?&quot;

Jupiter reached forward and pulled the other woman close. &quot;This,&quot; she 
said and proceed to kiss Lii as she had been kissed that day. As she 
had to Ran, so Lii wrapped her arms around Jupiter&#39;s waist. The kiss 
went on as long as the kiss from that day, and was as sweet.

When at last they parted, Lii held Jupiter&#39;s hands tightly. &quot;Please,&quot; 
she begged. &quot;Stay with me tonight, and tomorrow and the next day. No 
one need know that you failed to keep your appointment.&quot;

Jupiter pulled her hand away. &quot;But I will. And I have given my word &#150; 
something sacred to me.&quot; She looked down at her hands. &quot;And the Queen 
will know &#150; don&#39;t ask me how &#150; I just know she will. How could I ever 
look her in the face again if I fail in my quest?&quot;

Lii nodded slowly. &quot;Truly, you are brave and strong.&quot; She made an 
effort to pull herself together. &quot;Is that all you received for your 
days hunting?&quot; she asked coyly.

Jupiter nodded and stood. &quot;Was that not enough?&quot; she smiled and bade 
her hostess good night. As laid herself down to sleep, her hand rested 
upon the hidden girdle at her waist.

The morning was cold and dark. Lii girded Jupiter with her armor and 
repaired cloak. As she had announced, Ran did not appear to see her 
off. Jupiter waved her hand in farewell and walked away from the house 
on the hill without a backward glance. But her thoughts were as much 
behind the Senshi as upon the adventure before her. Her inner eye 
could see the two women and their somber sadness as they parted with 
her.

In a few minutes the sun disappeared behind a dark cloud. The forest 
loomed closely and the wind turned cold. Traces of snow lay on the 
ground before her and the grass was sere. Jupiter refused to turn 
around and find that the house was no longer there, so she kept her 
eyes fixed on the dark wall of trees before her.

All too soon the trees opened up and a path led into the darkness. 
Jupiter felt fear grow, as the trees pressed thickly about her. As she 
moved through the morning, the dread grew, until she drew up in front 
of a large, overgrown gate. A cold wind was blowing and Jupiter began 
to shiver. She pressed her hand into the gate and slowly, with much 
noise and complaint, it opened upon a grotto. Jupiter entered this 
place, her arms crossed against her chest so that they would not 
shake.

The darkness was absolute. From within the blackness came an eerie 
sound, a low moan that echoed throughout the grotto. The moan wailed 
on and on and Jupiter had to clench her fists until her nails cut into 
her palms so that she would not bolt. The slightest light became 
visible at one end of the grotto and Jupiter watched in fixed 
fascination as it grew. Green light poured forth from the figure that 
strode into the space when, at last, the Green Knight made her 
appearance.

Jupiter&#39;s clenched fists fell to her side as the giant approached. She 
knew that she was watching her death come for her and Jupiter desired, 
above all things at that moment, to see her Queen once more and say 
goodbye.

The giant smiled to see the Senshi there and bowed to her. &quot;So, you 
have come after all &#150; that is good.&quot;

&quot;I am here, Green Knight, as I vowed. I pray you make my death swift.&quot;

The giantess laughed at the halting words. &quot;So quick to run to your 
death. Is there nothing that you would not live for, little Senshi?&quot;

Jupiter thought of Ran&#39;s body close by her own, and Lii&#39;s arms wrapped 
about her waist. &quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Then face your death bravely, for those things depend on it.&quot;

The Green Knight lifted her axe and made a few passes with it, as 
Jupiter kneeled. &quot;Be careful, Knight and cut me cleanly &#150; I wish to be 
beautiful in my coffin,&quot; the Senshi joked tightly.

&quot;I know my business, I dare say,&quot; the knight replied.

Jupiter leaned her head forward, and she closed her eyes. The whirring 
of the axe stopped, a silence more fearful than the sound of it 
spinning. She clenched her body waiting for the blow. A grunt sounded 
from the giantess and Jupiter prayed to her patron planet for the care 
of her soul...but no blow landed.

The giantess pulled away with a laugh. &quot;Nicely done, Senshi &#150; now hold 
yourself at the ready!&quot; And the great axe was lifted once again.

So close she had come to death once before, this time she could not 
hold herself steady. As the air parted before the blade to let it 
through, Sailor Jupiter, one of the bravest of all the brave soldiers 
of Crystal Tokyo, flinched. She shrank from the sharp metal, pulling 
her head away at the last moment.

The Knight stepped back, cocking her head at the Jupiter. The Senshi, 
ashamed of her own fear, could not meet the green eyes that glowed 
down at her.

&quot;Apparently,&quot; Jupiter laughed a little at her own weakness, &quot;I am 
human after all.&quot; She took a deep breath and set herself in place once 
again. &quot;Have it, I won&#146;t move this time.&quot;

Nor did she. For the third time the axe swung and this time the Senshi 
stood her ground. The blade met flesh, parted it...and stopped. With 
nary but the barest edge of the steel blooded, the giantess pulled the 
axe away and stepped back.

&quot;Three strikes, brave Senshi. Once for your deceit, once for your fear 
and once, last of all, for your promise.&quot;

&quot;My deceit?&quot; Jupiter cried, rising to her feet. &quot;How did you...?&quot;

The Green Knight laughed. How else could I know? Only she who gave you 
a girdle of protection could know that you wore it.&quot;

&quot;Ran?&quot; Jupiter stared in wonder. &quot;You are Ran?&quot;

The Green Knight dropped the axe to the ground. She removed her helm 
and the gauntlets she wore. With each piece that fell away, she lost 
some of her stature. Her long hair glowed now, not with a horrible 
green light, but with the sunshine of a bright day. Her green eyes no 
longer glowed strangely, instead flickered with laughter.

When the last piece of armor was shed, Jupiter stared. For it was not 
Ran who gazed back at her, eyes alight with amusement, but Lii.

&quot;The first stroke &#150; a deceit. You lied to me, Sailor Jupiter of 
Crystal Tokyo. Only half of what you won yesterday did you share with 
me. The second stroke, a humbling testament to pride and fear. The 
third...well, the mark will not ever disappear, although the stroke is 
shallow &#150; and it shall remind you for the rest of your life of your 
humanity.&quot;

Jupiter put her hand to her neck, where the wound already had ceased 
to bleed. &quot;And so it shall &#150; and it will remind me also of the Green 
Knight who taught me that lesson.&quot; She smiled kindly upon Lii. &quot;Now I 
beg you &#150; tell me who you really are, sorceress.&quot;

&quot;Me?&quot; Lii spoke lightly. &quot;I come from a country across the sea, my 
name is Lii Ran.&quot;

&quot;Lii Ran,&quot; Jupiter repeated. &quot;Now that I fulfilled your challenge I 
have one for you.&quot;

***

 

It was spring, and once again the trees and flowers brightened Crystal 
Tokyo. The Queen had called together the Senshi for a formal meal. 
Once again, Senshi, Queen and King faced a woman clad all in green. 
Only this time, she was not alone.

Sailor Jupiter stepped forward to address her sister Senshi. &quot;I have 
come before you to proclaim that I have fulfilled my quest and my 
oath.&quot; She reached up and fingered the dark scar on her neck. 
&quot;Mostly.&quot; She laughed along with the others. &quot;And also to proclaim 
before you all, that I have subdued the Green Knight.&quot;

Lii stepped to Jupiter&#39;s side and took the Senshi&#39;s hand. 

&quot;And,&quot; Jupiter said to a beaming Queen, &quot;to tell you that if you wish 
to find me in the next few months, you will need to send a message to 
Greenlawn.&quot;

It was said, among those who knew the truth, that Sailor Jupiter lived 
the rest of her days with the sorceress Lii Ran at her side...but she 
was never too proud or too powerful to tell the tale of her humbling 
at the hands of the Green Knight.
