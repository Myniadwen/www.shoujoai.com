<h1>I'll Protect You (part 3 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/runestine.html">rune stine</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/illprotectu-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Rei was embarrassed sharing breakfast with Japan and Europe&#39;s phenomenal 
pop star, Minako Aino. It was all too much, she thought. Any body would 
have died just to share a breakfast with her. Although she was really 
hungry, she ate only a few just to make it faster to finish her food. 
Because she couldn&#39;t eat well when Minako is staring at her, she blushes 
every time her eyes met Minako&#39;s sparkling blue eyes.

As they finish their breakfast Wendy got out of the bathroom, now 
dressed in simple attire. Rei reached the backpack that her fellow agent 
Rinka had brought to her and took out another pair of agent uniform. 
This time it is colored gray

&quot;Would you mind if I take a shower? I could really tell that I smell 
already&quot; Rei said with embarrass in her voice

&quot;No, no. Ofcourse we wouldn&#39;t mind Ms. Hino, we know you deserve to take 
care of your self for a while, I&#39;ll take care of Minako while you were 
taking your shower&quot; Wendy said as she started to eat her own breakfast. 
Rei went into the bathroom

Suddenly an idea struck Minako&#39;s mind

Wendy watched Minako pick up the phone and ask for the floor manager to 
pass by outside their room. Now, what is Minako thinking again this 
time?

As the floor manager waits for the person who ordered her to stop by 
room 507, she was surprised when she saw Minako called her from behind 
the door she was waiting

&quot;Kami&#151;-Minako Aino!&quot; Said the floor manager in disbelief

&quot;Shhh&quot; Said Minako. Good thing no one is around

&quot;Do you have a pest in there? Like mouse?&quot; Whispered the pop star

&quot;Why yes, I just caught an injured mouse at the first floor Aino-san&quot; 
Said the woman

&quot;Can I have it?&quot; Minako asked directly

&quot;Oh nonono. You&#39;ll get your hands dirty Aino-san. Besides, what if this 
pest bites you?&quot; Said the concerned woman

&quot;Relax, if you lend me some of those gloves you are wearing the mouse 
won&#39;t able to bite me right?&quot;

The floor manager still isn&#39;t convinced. But then she had thought of it 
and...

&quot;Alright. I&#39;ll lend you my gloves and give you the mouse...but for one 
thing,&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot; Asked Minako

&quot;Can you sign an autograph for my daughter? She&#39;s a huge fan of yours&quot; 
Asked the woman. Minako sighed in relief

&quot;Of course why not?&quot; Said Minako. Then the woman gladly handed out a 
piece of paper and pen for the pop star to sign into. After that Minako 
finally got what she wanted from the woman. She gave the woman a huge 
hug and thanked her. The floor manager was really happy when she bid 
farewell to the pop star.

Minako was now holding the tail of the small mouse while wearing a glove 
to prevent the mouse from biting her. Wendy was about to approach her 
when she saw Minako holding a mouse

&quot;Aino-what-is-that&#151;&quot;

&quot;Shhhh! Just watch me Wendy okay! And don&#39;t speak!&quot; Minako hissed. Then 
she placed the injured mouse into the floor near her bed, and then she 
threw her gloves into the trash can near the window. She climbs up and 
stood at her bed. After that she concentrated, and then...

&quot;EEEEEEEEEEEKKKKK!&quot;

&#39;Finally I got a rewarding shower&#39; Rei thought as she sighed in the 
feeling of warm water flow through her head and body. She was enjoying 
her first shower here in the luxury hotel.

&#39;I guess I was just lucky...Minako Aino is god-damn beautiful...I don&#39;t 
know why but I can&#39;t take my mind off her. I guess I envy her because 
she&#39;s so perfect...and friendly.&#39; Rei was taken out of her thoughts 
when...

&quot;EEEEEEEEEEEKKKKK!&quot;

As Rei heard Minako scream, she immediately got out of the shower then 
she grabbed her bathroom towel and wrapped it quickly around her body. 
She ran and almost slips herself out of the hotel bathroom. Finally, she 
opened the bathroom door and stepped out to find Minako standing above 
her bed.

&quot;Rei-chan there&#39;s a mouse in the floor!&quot; Acted Minako

Rei sighed. All that screaming is because of a tiny mouse?

&#39;I must have convinced her&#39; Minako giggled in her thought as she still 
acted like scared of the mouse. Wendy was speechless

&quot;Rei-chan please take it away, I&#39;m scared of mouse!&quot; Minako fake pleaded 
as she covers her face with her hands to make it appear she didn&#39;t want 
to see that mouse in the face of the earth. But behind her hands is a 
giggling face

Rei once again sighed as she approaches to easily pick up the injured 
mouse by its tail. And then she threw the mouse out of the terrace

&quot;There. The pest is gone&quot; Said Rei. But instead seeing a still scared 
face of the pop star, she could have sworn Minako was giggling but 
stopped when she turns to face the pop star

&quot;Why were you smirking?&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t&quot;

&quot;You were&quot;

&quot;I was just happy you got rid of that mouse&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I swear&quot;

Rei was now glaring at Minako with amusement. Minako is really cute when 
she does that

&quot;If that is all, I guess I have to continue my shower then&quot; Said Rei as 
she turned her back. Then Minako called her again

&quot;Uh...Rei?&quot;

&quot;Yeah?&quot; Rei turned at Minako again, giving the pop star a full view of 
her bodyguard&#39;s sexy body

&quot;Nothing!&quot; Minako said cutely

Rei sighed and turned again &#39;This girl is impossible&#39;

As Rei went back in the bathroom, Minako laid her body back to her bed, 
sighed and then giggled. Wendy is still speechless

&quot;De-li-cious!&quot; Minako purred as she recalls how Rei looks with only 
wearing a bathroom towel. Too bad she wasn&#39;t able to pull it out of her 
bodyguard. She used her very effort to control her from doing it. If 
Wendy weren&#39;t watching she would have done that. Then she finally 
noticed Wendy

&quot;What can you say Wends?&quot; Asked Minako. Wendy was now awakened from what 
just happened

&quot;Come on Wendy say something&quot; Minako said to her manager

&quot;You told me not to speak right!&quot; Wendy said. Her voice with a twist of 
shock from what she saw

&quot;Aino, can you make things clear here, are you flirting with Ms. Hino?&quot; 
Wendy&#39;s voice became clear

&quot;What if I am? I&#39;m not that obvious, right?&quot; Minako cheerfully said

&quot;Geez Aino, I&#39;ll never get used to you! I&#39;ll let you do this because 
I&#39;ve never seen you very happy before. But never, I repeat never let the 
media make an issue out of this, or your whole career will end with a 
period&quot; Warned Wendy. Minako only giggled

&quot;Thaaannkk yooouuu!&quot; Minako hugged her manager then she went back to her 
bed again and daydream of how she saw Rei over and over again

&#39;If this becomes her obsession then I hope this won&#39;t ruin her career. 
But I have never seen Minako this happy, it&#39;s like she got ten times 
livelier than she was before&#39; Wendy sighed as she thought of possible 
solutions in case the media had discovered Minako is flirting with a 
girl, or her personal bodyguard to be more specific

As Rei went out of the bathroom she already wore her gray agent uniform

&quot;Does Ms. Aino have a schedule today?&quot; Asked Rei

&quot;Yes,&quot; Said Wendy as she scan her pocket scheduler

&quot;Minako has an interview at channel 6 studio four, ten thirty in the 
morning. You should take a bath now Aino&quot;

Minako nodded and went to the bathroom, before she closed the door she 
waited for Rei to look in her direction, and when Rei did, Minako gave 
her a flying kiss and continued to go inside the bathroom. Rei blinked a 
few times

&#39;JustMyImagination-JustMyImagination-JustMyImagination&#39; Rei kept saying 
in her mind

When Minako was finished taking a bath she went out of the bathroom, 
wearing the same bathroom towel that Rei wore after taking a shower

&quot;Is that my towel?&quot; Rei glared at the pop star

&quot;Yes why?&quot; Said Minako as she flirted

&quot;So why are you using it? No offense but don&#39;t you have your own towel?&quot; 
Rei was controlling her temper; she doesn&#39;t want anybody use her things

&quot;I do have my own bathroom towel, in fact I have five different colors 
and type of fabrics&quot; Said Minako as she walks around Rei, trying to 
seduce her bodyguard

&quot;Then...why use mine?&quot; Rei suddenly became nervous; this is going to be 
what she thinks it is going to happen

&quot;Because yours were softer...wider...and smells like...&quot; Minako paused 
to face Rei by few inches

&quot;...you...&quot; Minako Finished. Rei gulped while Wendy smiled and 
sweatdropped

&#39;Kami&#151;she&#39;s seducing me!&#39;

&quot;Well c-can I get it back now? I&#39;ll have to take it back to my duffle 
bag...&quot; Rei said

&quot;Then take it from my body&quot; Minako offered the edge of the towel that 
wrapped her body to Rei

&quot;Maybe later&quot; Rei said as she turned from Minako and blushed madly. 
Minako giggled then walked towards the dressing room

Minutes later Minako finally went out of the dresser room. Rei was 
stunned, her mouth wide open. Minako is wearing her red turtle-neck 
sleeveless blouse that clung perfectly to her beautiful body, and then 
she wore a tiny black skirt for her lower garments. The sights of the 
pop star&#39;s flawless legs were driving Rei mad. She wore her long black 
high-heeled boots that covered her feet and legs. Her long blonde hair 
is neatly pinned by a pretty red bow, as red as her blouse. Minako&#39;s 
lips were covered by a shiny Indian red lip stick

&quot;Wow Ms. Aino, you look fabulous&quot; Rei absent-mindedly said. Minako 
blushed and giggled

&quot;Thanks Rei-chan&quot;

&quot;If you go with us in Europe you&#39;ll see more than what Minako wears Ms. 
Hino&quot; Wendy teased. Rei snapped from her thoughts then blushed profusely

&quot;Well I guess I&#39;ll just stick with what I&#39;m wearing&quot; Wendy added

&quot;Then I guess we&#39;re all set, let&#39;s go then&quot; Rei now composed her self

Rei once again drove the pop star to the star network channel 6 studio 
four. As they arrived at the said studio they saw a pile of media men 
outside the entrance, they had expected it. Somehow they also noticed 
that the agents from TNPH were multiplied into more than three times. 
This time they look meaner and strict

&#39;Head chief multiplied the agents here, must have been because he 
doesn&#39;t want to repeat the incident last night. Poor chief&#39; Rei thought

Minako and Wendy were relieved when they successfully entered the studio 
without the media making trouble. For Minako, it startled her, but at 
the same time she felt like pouting because she couldn&#39;t cling to Rei 
when in case it happened again. But she was glad nothing bad happened 
there

&quot;Raven this is Eagle, have you entered studio four safely?&quot; The head 
chief&#39;s voice came out from Rei&#39;s earphone

&quot;This is Raven; we have entered studio four safe and sound Eagle, sir&quot; 
Rei replied

&quot;Good, good. Um...Rei?&quot; Rei paused as the head chief called her by her 
first name

&quot;Yes, Eagle sir?&quot;

&quot;Are you okay in there? I was worried at Aino-san and her manager, but 
I&#39;m also worried about you. If anything happens to you, your father 
won&#39;t forgive me&quot; The head chief said. Rei can tell the voice of the 
head chief is serious and sincere

Rei smiled

&quot;...Don&#39;t worry big boss, I&#39;m Hino Rei right? I&#39;d rather clean your 
office every weekend than to see you worried at me&quot; Rei said. Minako was 
looking at her; she liked that smile that she saw from Rei

Wendy called Minako from the stage of the studio. It is the stage where 
the talk show that will interview Minako will be held. Minako walked 
towards her manager merrily, Wendy introduced the talk show host to 
Minako

&quot;Minako, this is Tamako Yuhashi. The host of &#39;Stars Exposed&#39;&quot; Wendy 
pointed a short, skinny Japanese woman. Her hair is black but it was 
highlighted with blonde strips. She wore thick eyeglasses and has a 
small but noticeable mole on the lower left side of her left eye. Minako 
can tell she is the host because of the woman&#39;s thick lips topped with 
thick red lip stick

&quot;Please to meet you&#151;&quot;

&quot;Aino-san we are so excited to start this show especially that you are 
our very special guest!&quot; Said Tamako without pausing to breath

Minako sweat-dropped. She noticed the inner studio was pretty cold; she 
began to wrap her arms to her body. Then the show finally started. The 
director instructed Minako to sit at the stage couch with Tamako, the 
host of the show. The background music of the show played and everyone 
in the studio went quiet

Rei approached near Wendy. Together they watch the pop star in the 
studio stage</pre>
