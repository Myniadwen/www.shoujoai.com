<h1>Quiet Eyes</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<pre>She has quiet eyes. Eyes that are soft, that glitter, but rarely do they 
shine with tears.

And she is strong.

Usagi watches her carefully, although she is pretending to listen to 
Mamoru. She smiles at the right time, and when he jokes, she laughs. 
When he calls her his odango atama, she calls him Mamo-chan. When he 
says he loves her, she says she loves him too.
 
But she is staring at Rei when she says it.

Rei does not notice, per usual, engrossed in sipping her tea and looking 
over her shoulder at a sakura tree, watching the pale pink petals drift 
down onto the ground, like the feathers of some pink-winged angel.
 
They are at the park with the others, and Rei watches the trees.
 
And Usagi watches her.
 
Rei finally notices the scrutiny, and turns to Usagi.
 
&#147;Yes?&#148; she murmurs, her agitation hidden beneath half-closed eyelids and 
a soft smile.

The others watch the confrontation, although they pretend to be 
studying, or checking out handsome young men. Only Mamoru truly watches 
Usagi, waiting for her response to Rei&#146;s implied question.
 
&#147;Nothing,&#148; Usagi chirps, forcing a brilliant smile, &#147;you just look nice 
today, Rei-chan.&#148;
 
There is silence for a while. Setsuna shuffles and Minako smirks. They 
both know, but they remain silent. Minako not so much as Setsuna, but 
the Senshi of Love is not known to be as quiet as the all-knowing, stoic 
Senshi of Time.
 
Rei nods, gives a quick thank-you, and turns back to the sakura tree.
 
Usagi bites her lip, and eases against Mamoru, frowning when he holds 
her a bit tighter than she&#146;s used to.
 
The silence is broken by Minako&#146;s overly-cheerful voice, and the others, 
even the Outer Senshi, join in the conversation.
 
Only Usagi is quiet, nestled in Mamoru&#146;s arms as his soft chuckle 
rumbles through his chest, and Rei, who still watches the tree, barely 
concealed pain in those quiet, amethyst eyes.
 
Usagi wishes she had eyes like Rei, eyes that concealed emotions, that 
hardened, or went distant when she was afraid or angry. She wishes she 
had those eyes. 
 
And she hates the sakura tree, because Rei only has eyes for it that 
day.
