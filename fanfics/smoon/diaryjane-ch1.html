<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>If I had to, I would  put myself</em></span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Right beside you,</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So let me ask, would  you like that?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Would you like that?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Pain. It’s been my  world for hours. I don’t know where I am, <em>who</em> I am.  All I  know is that, I was fighting. I know I was. But, what was it? And why  was I fighting in the first place?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">God, everything hurts  so bad…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And I don’t mind,  if you say this love is the last time</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So now I’ll ask do  you like that? Do you like that?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>NO!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I looked at Rei with a  mixture of dread, anxiety, and pure, unadulterated fear. She’d been  in a coma for days now. Why did she have to be the one to throw  herself in the way of <em>everything</em> for me?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She fought two of the  Doom and Doom Girls for me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She stepped in front of  Galaxia’s energy disks for me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And now…this…why?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Why? <em>Why?!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Something’s  getting in the way</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Something’s just  about to break</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I will try to find  my place</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>In the Diary of Jane</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So tell me, how it  should be</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Darkness. I’m  floating in it. I can’t see my hand, my feet, or my body. In fact,  I can’t even <em>feel</em>.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Wait…I know I heard  something…a name…my name? I can’t hear it clearly…my head’s  so fuzzy…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Who am I?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Try to find out,  what makes you tick</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>As I lie down, sore  and sick</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Do you like that? Do  you like that?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ms. Tsukino?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The sound of my name  brought me out of my light doze. I turned in my seat to face the  nurse and blinked my weary eyes up at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Will you be staying  the night again Ms.Tsukino?” The nurse asked politely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wha-?” I looked at  the pink watch on my wrist and gasped quietly. And I thought it had  only been a short nap too…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I really should get  going..” then I saw Rei’s face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her face was pale, and  her hair was like black silk, spreading across the sheets. Her  normally red lips were a delicate shade of peach. I breathed and  turned back to the nurse.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>There’s a fine  line, between love and hate</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And I don’t mind,  just let me say</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That I like that. I  like that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I know something’s  happening, beyond this realm of limbo that I’m stuck in. In all the  time that I’ve spent here, there’s been something that’s been  keeping me from fading away completely. But now, it, it’s going…yes  I can feel it!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Please….Please…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Don’t let me fade  away…not in this place of shadow and hate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Please…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Something’s  getting in the way</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Something’s just  about to break</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I will try to find  my place</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>In the Diary of Jane</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll think I’ll  stay again.” I said softly. “I just need to-.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll call your  house for you.” The nurse said smiling. “I’ll send someone to  bring in a cot and some extra sheets and pillows for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you…” I  whispered, a ghost of a smile on my face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>As I burn another  page</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>As I look the other  way</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I still try to find  my place</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>In the Diary of Jane</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So tell me how it  should be</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That presence…it’s  back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Did it hear me? If so  then maybe I can find a way out. Something soft brushes my face…it  feels like warm satin. It travels from my cheek to my forehead,  brushing away my bangs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Dammit, why can’t I  move my hands!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then something even  softer than before presses against my forehead and I feel something  strike my soul…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong><em>I’ll never  leave you…</em></strong>a voice whispers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And I know its telling  the truth…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Desperate I will  crawl</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Waiting for so long</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>No love</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>There’s no love</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I traced my hand down  Rei’s cheek, feeling my heart speed up when I discovered that Rei’s  skin was silky smooth. Without my noticing, my hand had traveled over  Rei’s face and had brushed away her bangs. Then, I did something  that made me question my own sanity.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I leaned down and, ever  so softly, kissed Rei’s forehead.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I felt a little jolt go  through me and I whispered, “I’ll never leave you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Die for anyone</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What have I become?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My chest feels so  strange. There’s this, pounding that makes it hurt so much.  Adrenaline shoots through my body and I can’t breathe, I can’t  move.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That presence…it’s  gone…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And I’m fading….</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Something’s  getting in the way</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Something’s just  about to break</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I walked out of the  bathroom and smiled slightly. I had a feeling that Rei was getting  better.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That feeling faded when  I saw the monitor that showed Rei’s pulse was flashing red.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I will try to find  my place</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>In the Diary of Jane</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Where are you? You left  and I’m fading. You lied to me…<em>betrayed me…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No…you’re still  there…but…I’m still fading…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And I think I remember  now…A youma…a flash of claws…you in danger, then…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Black.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>As I burn another  page</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>As I look the other  way</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I pressed the emergency  button over and over again, trying to call a nurse to help me. Help  her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No! No, no, no, no…”  I cried. According to the machines, Rei’s vitals were plummeting.  She was dieing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My Rei-chan was dieing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I still try to find  my place</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>In the Diary of Jane</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yes…I remember now…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami…Makoto…Minako…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Setsuna…Haruka and  Michiru…Hotaru and Chibi-Usa…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Something’s  getting in the way…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please no, God no!”  I wailed. The machines were sounding a loud alarm as Rei began to  thrash on the bed. Later, I would remember that it was the first  movement she had made in three days.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei gripped my hand and  I held onto hers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I won’t let go!”  I whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I knew I would have to.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Something’s just  about to break…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Luna…Artemis….even  little Diana…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><strong>I won’t let go!</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No…don’t let go,  love….</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Don’t let go…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I will try to find  my place…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei!” I screamed.  “Rei! Don’t go! Please!” I lowered my head and rested my  forehead on her chest. “Don’t do this to me again!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her eyes snapped open  and I locked gazes with her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I love you!” I  wailed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She had to know before  it was too late.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before she left me  again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>In the Diary of Jane</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong><em>Rei!</em></strong> My  name…its Rei…I remember that too…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong><em>Rei! Don’t go!  Please!</em></strong> I remember you too…my angel…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong><em>Don’t do this  to me again!</em></strong> I finally leave my hell.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And I see you. My  savior…my angel…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I love you!” You  scream.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Usagi…love …”  I whisper hoarsely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then, white.</span></p>
