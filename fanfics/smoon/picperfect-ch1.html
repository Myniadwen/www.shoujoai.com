fanfiction by <a href="../authors/prince_kitten.html">Prince_Kitten</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Authors Note: Just a cute Ami/Setsuna moment that popped into my head for 
no apparent reason and wouldn&#39;t go away. Enjoy!

                 ********************************************

	What remained of the red goo inside the container was centrifugally 
smashed against the outside shell as the container spun round and round on 
its wobbly path. After a few rotations, the spinning slowed, and the bottle 
rested.
	
&quot; All right! Move over Usagi, you&#39;re mine Mamoru!&quot; Minako squealed 
with delight as the ketchup bottle in the center of the semi-circle of 
friends pointed his way. Ami watched from the sidelines with amusement as 
Usagi tackled Minako in an effort to keep Minako from her Prince and was 
consequently tackled by Rei who thought tormenting Usagi was one of life&#39;s 
greatest treasures. 
	
It was Minako&#39;s 18th birthday and the party had started hours ago. 
Coinciding with Minako&#39;s interest in having a really really good time in 
life, Haruka had brought a gift of some hard liquor. At several parties in 
the past, soft alcohol like wine coolers had been drunk with vigor but as 
Minako had put it she was &#39;all growed up now thank you&#39; and the proper 
present had been bestowed. As with all of the other celebrations, the drinks 
were passed all around, and the majority of the scouts were smashed to some 
degree or another. The protectors of the galaxy tended to let go, and let go 
hard. Haruka and Michiru usually stayed conscious and aware for longer 
because they drank more, and could handle liquor better than the newbie 
inners. Haruka quite often took advantage of the inebriation level of the 
others and had yet again brought a camera which she was now using gleefully 
to capture Minako&#39;s attempts to kiss Mamoru, Mamoru&#39;s attempt at escape, and 
the wrestling match that had erupted between Rei and Usagi. Makoto sat 
somewhere in the middle, torn between holding Mamoru down for Minako&#39;s sake, 
and holding Minako back for Mamoru&#39;s sake. For her own part, Ami stayed off 
to the side, content to watch.
	
Very rarely did she drink enough to be even tipsy, but since she had 
not been able to come up with a single class, assignment or test that she 
had to study for, she&#39;d decided to let go and have fun. That, and Rei and 
threatened to torment her all night about Makoto if she didn&#39;t loosen up. 
With a sigh Ami watched Makoto happily take her turn spinning the bottle. It 
really wasn&#39;t spin the bottle that they were playing. In actuality it was a 
drunken mix of spin the bottle, truth or dare, and twister. Ami wasn&#39;t even 
sure what dictated what but watching the others figure it out was more than 
entertaining. Makoto&#39;s spin ended up pointing at the couch, which sent her, 
Minako, and Michiru to the Twister board. 
	
As Ami watched everyone she realized that there was someone else she 
hadn&#39;t seen for a while. Setsuna came to pretty much every party, mostly 
because Haruka made her. Like Ami, she usually stayed on the side and sipped 
at a single drink the whole night. But Ami had noticed her knocking back 
just as many as Ami herself had. Looking around she saw the glass door to 
the balcony open and moved quietly and slowly around the perimeter of the 
room to the door. Peeking out she saw Setsuna leaning up against the 
railing, looking up at the stars. Glancing back at the others to make sure 
they were too preoccupied to notice her escape, she slipped outside and into 
the cool night air. Setsuna turned to see her visitor and smiled at Ami&#39;s 
slightly wobbly approach.
	
&quot; Hello Ami-san.&quot;
	
&quot; Hello Setsuna-san.&quot; Ami smiled and leaned up against the balcony 
railing next to Setsuna, taking a deep breath of the night air. The rush of 
oxygen left her woozy and she let her head rest on her hands until she could 
see straight again.
	
&quot; Drink a little too much?&quot; Setsuna teased and Ami just snorted.&quot; 
You&#39;re not usually the type to let loose like this Ami-san.&quot; Ami smiled and 
turned to look at the taller woman.
	
&quot; Neither are you Setsuna-san.&quot; Setsuna just smiled back and they 
stood in comfortable silence for a few moments.
	
&quot; So, what is going on in there anyway? Every once in a while there 
are loud shouts and squeals then laughter and it gets quiet again.&quot; Ami 
laughed at Setsuna&#39;s question.

	&quot; You know, I was trying to figure that out before I came out here. As 
best as I can tell, it&#39;s a highly evolved form of ritualistic challenges of 
bravery and courage incorporating a flexibility skill test all based on 
one&#39;s ability to master centrifugal force within a limited parameter.&quot; Ami&#39;s 
smile widened as Setsuna&#39;s eyes crossed trying to decipher what Ami had 
said. Pleased that she still had the ability to confound people like Setsuna 
even when drunk, she took pity on her. &quot; They are playing a mix of spin the 
bottle that leads to truth or dare or Twister.&quot; Setsuna made a face in Ami&#39;s 
direction and she laughed, enjoying the freedom that alcohol gave her by 
lowering the inhibitions that normally kept her playful side in check.
	
&quot; So, how come you aren&#39;t playing with them?&quot; Setsuna asked and Ami 
shrugged, turning back to the stars. 
	
&quot; I don&#39;t know. Somehow making a fool of myself knowing that Haruka is 
taking pictures that she fully intends to use as blackmail doesn&#39;t seem like 
something I want to do.&quot; Setsuna shook her head. Haruka&#39;s pictures of the 
scout parties were practically famous, at least within their little group, 
and they were the main thing the girls feared after a party, hangovers came 
second. Setsuna watched Ami as the shorter girl stared up, her face not 
exactly the picture of ultimate happiness. Deciding that she was still 
technically wasted enough to have fun without feeling to bad about it in the 
morning, she put a smirk n her face.
	
&quot; Are you sure that the real reason you don&#39;t want to play isn&#39;t that 
you haven&#39;t had your first kiss yet?&quot; As predicted, Ami turned a bright red 
and Setsuna allowed herself to enjoy the feeling.
	
&quot; Actually,&quot; Ami countered, doing her best to rid herself of her 
blush, &quot; I&#39;ve already had my first kiss.&quot; Setsuna raised her eyebrow.
	
&quot; Oh really?&quot; Ami did her best to keep a straight face for as long as 
she could but gave in quickly.
	
&quot; Well, technically I have.&quot; She amended. It had been mortifying when 
it had happened, but it was now one of her most treasured memories. &quot; 
Makoto-chan and I were walking down the street and she started walking 
backwards in front of me. She was really excited about some guy or 
something. Neither of us was paying attention and she walked right into a 
street lamp. The force knocked her forwards, right at me. Before I knew it 
we were lying in the middle of the sidewalk, her right on top of me. And we 
were, well, kissing.&quot; Ami grinned remembering how fast Makoto had turned 
red. Setsuna smiled too, letting Ami indulge in memories.
	
&quot; I suppose that counts, but have you had one on purpose yet?&quot; Ami 
flushed again but turned to face Setsuna, and leaned her elbow on the 
handrail.
	
&quot; Ryo-chan tried to once in middle school, but I didn&#39;t let him.&quot; She 
admitted.

	&quot; Why not? I thought you two were quite interested in one another, at 
least back then.&quot; Setsuna watched Ami&#39;s face twist and it looked like she 
was considering something seriously. Then she looked off in the distance and 
started mumbling something. Setsuna was about to ask her to speak up when 
she realized that Ami was talking to herself on purpose. Setsuna was pretty 
sure Ami did that all the time anyway, but in her inebriated state, she was 
doing it aloud. It was kind of funny, listening to her go back and forth 
with different tones and facial expressions for each side of the apparent 
argument. Setsuna picked up Ami&#39;s next comment. Strangely, it sounded 
something like &#39; what would she care, she lives with Haruka-san.&#39; With that, 
Ami took a deep breath and looked up at Setsuna. Setsuna put on a serious 
face as she had nearly been laughing at Ami&#39;s self-conversation.	
	
&quot; Honestly, the real reason that I wouldn&#39;t let him kiss me, is, well, 
I&#39;m like Haruka-san and Michiru-san. Get it?&quot; Setsuna raised her eyebrow 
again and fought the urge to say &#39;Well, duh.&#39; Her musings were interrupted 
as Ami balled her fist and squinted at Setsuna. &quot; And if you tell anyone, 
aside from Rei, so help me...&quot; She threatened. Setsuna tried to hold onto 
her laughter. She really did. But taking a drunk and annoyed Ami that 
seriously over did it and Setsuna burst out into laughter. Ami growled. &quot; 
Oi! I&#39;m being serious!&quot; That sent Setsuna into more laughter and she doubled 
up, holding onto her sides. Seeing Setsuna laugh harder than Ami ever had 
before alleviated her anger and the reasonable side of her brain kicked in 
and told her that Setsuna was not exactly a gossip risk. Once Setsuna had 
calmed down she crossed her heart and held up three fingers. 
	
&quot; Girl Scout&#39;s honor says I won&#39;t tell.&quot; She promised solemnly and Ami 
just made a face.
	
&quot; Girl Scouts hold up two fingers, not three.&quot; She said dryly and 
Setsuna quickly changed her hand sign. Ami just rolled her eyes and leaned 
back against the railing. Setsuna followed her actions and they listened to 
the sounds of squealing coming from the room for a while. Ami broke the 
silence by tilting her head and regarding the taller senshi.
	
&quot; What about you Setsuna-san?&quot; She asked and Setsuna nearly choked. 
Her brain flew through a thousand different answers and she turned bright 
red at the personal question. She was about a give an answer, one that was 
evading and easily misconstrued until Ami continued with the question.&quot; Have 
you had your first kiss yet?&quot; The blood all drained from Setsuna&#39;s cheeks 
and she sighed, letting out a breath. 
	
&quot; With how old I am? Of course I have.&quot; Setsuna smiled and shook her 
head, she couldn&#39;t believe she thought Ami would ask something like that. 
Ami cocked her head to the side.
	
&quot; Who was your first kiss with?&quot; She asked and Setsuna felt the breath 
catch in her throat. Sighing she looked out over the city lights and let 
herself remember. Her first kiss had been during Crystal Tokyo. It had been 
another scout party, or Princess Ball as they had been called then. Once 
again she had been a little drunk and had been thinking about how her crush 
didn&#39;t seem to regard her anything more than a friend. Then Ami had joined 
her out in the courtyard, equally drunk, and started to lament about how her 
crush didn&#39;t seem to notice her. One thing had lead to another, and a very 
nice, very good kiss had followed. Setsuna smiled at the memory.
	
&quot; Well, naturally I played around a bit when I was younger. But 
actually Ami-san, my first real kiss was with the Sailor Mercury of Crystal 
Tokyo.&quot; 

	&quot; With me?&quot; Ami squeaked.

	&quot; Well, the you of the past.&quot; Setsuna corrected. Ami was silent and 
Setsuna just stared out at the city, remembering the past. 

	&quot; Were, were....&quot; Ami started hesitantly. Setsuna looked over at her 
but Ami kept her eyes on the floor, hands clasped in front of her. &quot; Were 
you and I, the I of the past, were we, lovers?&quot; She finally questioned and 
Setsuna quirked a smile.

	&quot;We messed around a bit, but no more than another of the other scouts. 
We were just, feeling sorry for ourselves because our respective crushes 
didn&#39;t really consider us romantic possibilities. And we were a little 
drunk. I guess we just, gave in. We both just wanted human contact, safety. 
We got tired of being lonely and just wanted to see what it was like. 
Especially since the others constantly reported how much fun it was.&quot; Ami 
couldn&#39;t help but smile. The others told her everyday how much fun it was to 
date and kiss and whatnot. It seemed as though history was repeating itself. 
A light bulb lit up in Ami&#39;s head. It was not the sort of idea she would 
have entertained had she been sober. In fact, if alcohol hadn&#39;t been 
directly involved, she was sure her brain would have stopped this route of 
thinking long ago. But then, what was the fun of drinking if you couldn&#39;t do 
things you wouldn&#39;t normally do? Carefully planning ahead in her mind, Ami 
put on a rueful face.

	&quot; I probably have it for the same person now as I did in the last life 
huh?&quot; She mourned. Setsuna nodded and Ami sighed. &quot; Do you have a crush on 
anyone Setsuna-san?&quot; Setsuna regarded Ami thoughtfully before answering.

	&quot; I&#39;m to old to have crushes.&quot; Ami made a face.

	&quot; Is there someone in whom you are particularly interested?&quot; Ami 
rephrased and Setsuna stared at her for a moment more.

	&quot; Yes, there is.&quot; Ami nodded calmly and drew little patterns on the 
handrail for a few minutes. 

	&quot; Is it the same person as in Crystal Tokyo?&quot; She asked innocently. 
Setsuna frowned a bit.

	&quot; Yes, actually it is...&quot; She trailed off as Ami looked up at her. The 
blue-haired genius was flushing but there was a fire in her eyes that 
reminded Setsuna of the night so long ago.

	&quot; Isn&#39;t it interesting that here we are, 1000 years later, both at 
party, separated from everyone else, slightly drunk, staring up at the stars 
again?&quot; She moved a few steps closer and Setsuna tried to calm her 
breathing. &quot; And that we both just happen to be interested in the same 
people, and be in the same position with them as last time?&quot; Setsuna nodded 
slowly as Ami stopped right in front of her, head tilted up to met her eyes. 
&quot; One could almost say history was repeating itself.&quot;

	&quot; One could say that.&quot; Setsuna whispered and moved closer. She stared 
down at Ami&#39;s face, slightly flushed, soft sparkling eyes, lips parted just 
a little. Slowly Setsuna raised her hand and her eyes followed its path as 
it lightly traced up Ami&#39;s arm and ran it through the girl&#39;s hair. She 
pulled her arm in, tilting Ami&#39;s head up and angling it to the side. Slowly 
she lowered her own head, tilting it opposite Ami&#39;s. Her lids drooped as she 
focused on Ami&#39;s lips, now inches from her own. Quickly she darted her 
tongue out, licking her own lips before titling down until she could feel 
their breaths mingle. A quick look up told her that Ami had already closed 
her eyes and was waiting for Setsuna. She moved forward hesitantly, then 
closed the distance between them and pressed her lips against Ami&#39;s. She was 
flooded with heat and she felt her knees go weak. Ami&#39;s lips were warm and 
soft under her own and she increased the pressure. She felt Ami&#39;s lips part 
slightly and was tempted to keep going. But she knew that Ami&#39;s crush would 
eventually give in and she didn&#39;t want to rob Ami of her first really 
serious kiss. Slowly she pulled back and Ami leaned back too, as she had 
been standing on her toes to reach Setsuna. They stood there, foreheads 
resting against each other, eyes still closed. When her breathing had 
returned to normal, Setsuna looked up to see Ami&#39;s blue eyes staring back at 
her. A bit breathily Ami asked,

	&quot; Was that, like last time, Setsuna-san?&quot; Setsuna closed her eyes 
briefly then smiled and looked back at Ami.

	&quot; Yes, it very much was Ami-san.&quot; Ami smiled and closed her eyes 
again, content to stand and rest for a moment. Setsuna&#39;s ears caught noises 
however and she turned to face the sliding door.

	&quot; Where did they disappear too?&quot; Minako asked.

	&quot; I don&#39;t know. But we at least need Ami-chan for the next game.&quot; Rei 
added. Ami sprang back from Setsuna just as the door opened and Makoto poked 
her head out.

	&quot; Hey, there you guys are.&quot; She opened the door all the way and Minako 
stumbled past her, falling pretty much onto Ami.

	&quot; Geeze, we thought you&#39;d up and left. But now that you&#39;re here again, 
you can come and play with us. It&#39;ll be more fun to dare someone who gets 
embarrassed anyway.&quot;

	&quot; Yeah. Minako-chan&#39;s way to willing to take it all off.&quot; Rei teased 
and Minako promptly engaged her in a tongue war. Makoto dropped an arm over 
Ami&#39;s shoulders and guided her back into the house after Rei and Minako.

	&quot; What were you doing out here anyway Ami-chan?&quot; Ami smiled up at 
Makoto.

	&quot; Just looking at the stars.&quot; She answered. Setsuna watched them 
retreat and sighed softly. Behind the curtain Haruka clicked shut her camera 
phone and grinned.

The next morning Setsuna sipped at her coffee. Thankfully her longer 
life had allowed her more drinking opportunities, and a bigger resistance to 
hangovers. Hers was minimal but after a run-in with a very grouchy pre-
coffee Michiru, she was extremely glad for her resistance. She was fully 
expecting Haruka to be worse off, and Haruka hated mornings anyway. So, when 
Haruka practically bounced into the kitchen, Setsuna knew something was 
wrong. For one thing, Haruka never bounced unless she was very happy about 
something. And it usually meant doom for one of the scouts. Though she could 
have gotten some good pictures from the party, they would have had to be 
incredible for this level of perkiness. She watched Haruka suspiciously as 
the blonde made herself a cup of coffee and sat down across from Setsuna. 
They sat in silence for a few minutes until Haruka pulled out a package and 
slid it over to Setsuna.

	&quot; Would you like to look at the pictures I got from last night?&quot; She 
asked innocently and Setsuna smirked. So it was blackmail pictures.

	&quot; No thanks, I&#39;m good.&quot; She answered and Haruka shrugged, standing up.

	&quot; Are you sure? I got some really good pictures of the stars.&quot; She 
said and Setsuna froze. She looked up at Haruka slowly and the tall senshi 
grinned playfully. &quot; Go ahead and keep any that you like.&quot; She added and 
walked out of the kitchen, coffee cup in hand. Setsuna looked at the bundle 
of pictures with a mixture of apprehension, fear, and excitement. She opened 
the package and took out the stack of photos. She couldn&#39;t help the smile 
that cam to her face as she saw pictures of the girls posing together sailor 
moon style. Pictures of the group, several of what looked to be a very 
complicated Twister game, and kisses between pretty much everyone save for 
herself and Ami. Several of what looked like Mamoru running from Minako, and 
then some of Rei and Usagi in a wrestling match. She flipped to the next one 
and her heart leapt. It was a picture of her and Ami standing together out 
on the balcony looking up at the stars. Setsuna turned to the next one to 
see herself and Ami standing pre-kiss. Ami&#39;s eyes were closed and her head 
was tilted up slightly. Setsuna had her hand behind Ami&#39;s head and was only 
millimeters away. The next two pictures were of the kiss, beautifully taken, 
and the last one was right afterward as they rested against each other. 
Setsuna laughed and nearly cried looking at them. She pulled the photos out 
and wrapped the rest up. Standing she turned to run out of the kitchen, 
nearly running over Michiru who had just come down from her shower. Michiru 
watched in confusion as a very uncharacteristic Setsuna threw her arms 
around Haruka and hugged her tight. Haruka was laughing and patting her back 
saying, &quot;No, go ahead it&#39;s okay. You&#39;re welcome.&quot; Finally Setsuna walked 
calmly back into the kitchen and sat down. Haruka stood in the doorway and 
Michiru walked over to her, cocking her head to the side.

	&quot; What was that all about?&quot; She asked her lover and Haruka just 
grinned.

	&quot; Setsuna-san just wanted some of the pictures I took last night.&quot; She 
smiled down at Michiru who 
was looking between her and Setsuna.

	&quot; Setsuna-san wanted some of the pictures you took? That can&#39;t be 
good.&quot; Haruka made a face.

	&quot; Hey, I&#39;m not that bad.&quot; Michiru was about to answer when Setsuna 
interrupted.

	&quot; No, you&#39;re not that bad. You&#39;re the kindest person I&#39;ve ever met.&quot; 
Haruka nodded in triumph and Michiru&#39;s jaw dropped. Setsuna put her cup in 
the sink and hugged Haruka again as she walked out the door.

	&quot; Thank you again for the pictures.&quot; She said and Haruka grinned and 
leaned up against the doorframe.

	&quot; Like I said, it&#39;s really no big deal.&quot; She waited patiently as 
Setsuna walked past and was almost out of earshot and added, &quot; Besides, I 
have plenty of copies.&quot;
