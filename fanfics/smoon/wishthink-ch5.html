<a href="../smoon/wishthink-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Venus slammed Mars up against the wall. Hard. The sharp clang of metal 
on stone seemed to echo throughout the entire palace.

&quot;Mina! Be quiet! You wanna wake everyone up?&quot;

The blonde giggled and pressed herself up against the stoic warrior.

&quot;Oh, come on Rei. You wanted to move this out of the garden.&quot; she 
murmured, running her finger tips down the soldier&#39;s face. &quot;And besides, 
it&#39;s just the four of us in this entire wing. I&#39;m sure Jupiter and 
Mercury are out cold. They&#39;ll never know what we&#39;re doing.&quot;

&quot;Just what are we doing?&#39;

&quot;Getting to know each other a little better. Do you always have to be so 
serious?&quot;

&quot;Someone has to be. Do you ever the get the feeling like you&#39;re sane, 
and everyone is crazy, or that you&#39;re crazy, and everyone else is sane?&quot;

Cerulean eyes blinked in confusion. &quot;Do you get like this every time you 
get drunk?&quot;

&quot;Probably. I guess that makes me the crazy one.&quot;

Minako pulled Rei&#39;s face down and kissed her gently. &quot;You know,&quot; she 
whispered, &quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re crazy.&quot;

&quot;No?&quot;

Another giggle. &quot;No. You want to know what I think is crazy?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure I want to know. Wait. Wait. I&#39;m sure now. No.&quot;

&quot;Ahhh! Rei!!&quot; Venus cried, looking very hurt indeed.

&#39;The lip. She&#39;s giving me the pouting lip. That is not fair. Gods.&#39; Mars 
let out a defeated sigh. &quot;Ok, tell me. What&#39;s so crazy?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s crazy is the fact that I put up with you!&quot;

Rei laughed. &quot;No one told you that you had to.&quot;

&quot;True. But you&#39;re just so damn sexy I can&#39;t help it.&quot;

Mars wasn&#39;t sure if it was all the alcohol coursing through her veins, 
or if it was the fact that the blonde hadn&#39;t given her personal space in 
hours, but all the blood in her body rushed straight to her face.

&quot;Aw! Now that&#39;s cute!&quot;

&quot;Shut up.&quot; Rei growled.

&quot;Make me...&quot; the blonde purred.

Rei&#39;s heart jumped in her chest at the look in Minako&#39;s eyes. She 
paused, for the briefest of seconds, as if unsure how to proceed. At 
last, shaky arms wound themselves around Venus&#39; waist, and Mars pulled 
her close.

Minako suddenly seemed very shy, and Rei almost felt guilty. She looked 
vulnerable, almost fragile, but it was the blonde that initiated the 
next kiss.

Shy, and sweet at first, but it intensified into something much 
stronger. Mars was slammed back into the wall again, but this time, she 
had no comment.

The wall Rei had so carefully built around her feelings crumbled. All 
the frustration, hurt, and anger seemed to fuel her. Her unrequited love 
haunting her as she switched positions quickly, trapping Minako against 
the wall.

The kisses were desperate now. Venus buried her fingers in raven black 
hair as Mars ravished her mouth. She moaned in sweet pleasure as Rei 
began to guide them back to her room now, never stopping. Deft fingers 
made short work of the blonde&#39;s clothing and armor, scattered all down 
the corridor.

Rei&#39;s head was buzzing deliriously, and her heart felt like it was 
hammering in her ears. She kicked the door to her room open, and the 
drunken pair stumbled in. Minako began to remove Rei&#39;s clothing, running 
burning hands all over her body, and Mars found she had barely enough 
sense of mind to slam the door shut.

Everything began to blur at that point. Venus pushed her backwards, onto 
the bed, and pulled Mars&#39; boots off.

&quot;Damn. You really are the goddess of love.&quot; Rei admitted, breathless.

&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been saying. But you damn Martians are so 
thickheaded.&quot; Minako replied with a giggle, sliding Rei&#39;s pants down and 
off, tossing the garment over her shoulder.

Mars growled, pulling a very flushed, lightheaded blonde down beside 
her. In one smooth motion, she yanked the blanket from the foot of the 
bed up and around both of them.

A rough, calloused hand traveled over silky smooth skin, starting at the 
blonde&#39;s shoulder and stopping at the small of her back, with feather 
light kisses in between. She shook the dark hair out of her eyes and 
moved back up, kissing Minako lightly on the lips.

&quot;Tell me. Are you sure you want to do this Mina?&#39; her voice low and 
husky. Minako pressed the palm of her hand against Rei&#39;s cheek, crystal 
clear blue searching violet.

&quot;Because, I couldn&#39;t stop now, even if I wanted to.&quot; Mars whispered. &quot;I 
don&#39;t know how you do this to me.&quot;

&quot;Well, it helped that I got you completely drunk.&quot;

&quot;Like I&#39;d have to be drunk to notice you.&quot; Rei murmured, tracing 
invisible shapes across Minako&#39;s back with her fingertips.

&quot;Like I said before, you Martians are dumb.&quot;

Rei began to kiss and suck at the blonde&#39;s neck. &quot;Am I being dumb now?&quot;

&quot;Oh god, no.&quot; Minako breathed, squeezing her eyes shut.

&quot;Then tell me, are you sure?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

Rei tightened her arms around Minako, and pressed her face in the 
blonde&#39;s neck. &quot;I&#39;m not sure what will happen in the morning.&quot; she 
admitted, burning a path of hot butterfly kisses across Minako&#39;s 
collarbone.

&quot;We can worry about that tomorrow.&quot; Minako gasped, burying her fingers 
in raven locks, as the hand that was on her back slid over her hip, and 
down her thigh.

&quot;Figured you&#39;d say something like that.&quot; Mars replied with a smile, 
letting her hand travel where the blonde wanted it most.

&quot;Oh God, Rei. Just don&#39;t let go.&quot;

&quot;Never.&quot; Mars whispered. The fire soldier almost couldn&#39;t believe her 
name could sound like that. The feelings that ran through her as the 
sweet words tumbled from the goddess&#39; lips seemed foreign. She felt 
hurt, but it was as if she couldn&#39;t remember why. As she pushed Mina 
over the edge, and wonderfully long nails ran down her spine, she looked 
into beautiful blue eyes and saw her own thoughts and fears gazing back 
at her. It hurt.

Rei laid down beside the blonde, and pulled her impossibly close, 
lightly dragging her fingers through the golden silk that cascaded down 
Minako&#39;s back.

They laid together like that, for what seemed to be hours.

&#39;God, she&#39;s beautiful. So beautiful it hurts.&#39; She had to close her 
eyes, just for a moment. It was killing her, and she could at last 
remember the reason why.

&quot;Why? Why do you have to look so much like her?&quot;

A soft, gentle caress of her cheek broke her resolve, and her eyes 
opened, shining with the tears that threatened to spill over. Minako 
leaned forward and kissed her, gently.

&quot;I understand how you feel.&quot; the blonde whispered. &quot;All too well.&quot; A 
tender smile. Sad, broken blue eyes.

Rei tried to speak .She wanted to give words of comfort, to soothe them 
both, but the words seemed to die on her lips.

&quot;I understand.&quot; Minako repeated, beautifully soft kisses following her 
words.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Rei&#39;s voice cracked.

&quot;Don&#39;t be, because I&#39;m not. And besides, there&#39;s absolutely nothing 
wrong with us being miserable together.&quot; the blonde replied with a 
genuine smile.

Rei had to laugh at that.

&quot;That&#39;s better.&quot; the blonde giggled. &quot;You&#39;re so beautiful when you&#39;re 
not sulking.&quot; She punctuated her statement with a wink. &quot;But do kindly 
tell me what&#39;s so funny.&quot;

&quot;Your logic. It confuses me sometimes.&quot; she admitted with a grin.

&quot;It&#39;s supposed to, I&#39;m a blonde, remember? The day I start making sense 
to a dumb Martian like you, the universe would implode.&quot;

Mars laughed again, and kissed Venus gratefully. &quot;Thank you. For 
everything,&quot;

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m not even close to done with you.&quot; the blonde purred, pushing 
Rei onto her back.

And as Venus began to teach Mars exactly why she was called the goddess 
of love, Rei couldn&#39;t help but think that Minako had been right all 
along, about everything.

--------------

&quot;How much longer do you think she&#39;s going to sleep?&quot; Serenity murmured, 
resting her head on Minako&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;I don&#39;t know Princess.&quot; Venus answered truthfully, wrapping an arm 
around her. She frowned inwardly. &#39;Mars, I don&#39;t know what you were 
thinking.&#39;

Jupiter let out a frustrated sigh from the other side of the infirmary. 
&quot;Well, if she doesn&#39;t wake up soon, I&#39;m going to punch her myself.&quot; she 
proclaimed rather loudly.

&quot;Makoto.&quot; Ami warned quietly, thumping the thunder soldier in the arm. 
Mercury pressed her finger to her lips for silence and turned back to 
the doctor she was consulting.

&quot;Sorry.&quot; Jupiter murmured, hanging her head.

Minako giggled, despite the serious situation. &quot;Whipped.&quot;

The brunette&#39;s jaw dropped in indignation, and she was about to reply, 
but was silenced by Mercury&#39;s warning look.

Venus snickered quietly, earning herself a gentle thump in the head from 
her princess.

&quot;Behave.&quot; Serenity warned, but the smile tugging at her lips killed any 
reproach in her voice.

Minako gave her a sheepish grin, and shrugged lightly.

Jupiter pointed her finger at Venus, and mouthed the word whipped.

Minako coughed, and turned her head, but Makoto had already caught the 
light pink blush that graced her cheeks.

Mars shifted slightly in the infirmary bed then stilled. The somber mood 
returned, and the group fell silent.

&quot;All right.&quot; Mercury said with a nod, motioning for everyone to come 
close as the doctor excused himself. &quot;She&#39;s lost a lot of blood, of 
course, but she should recover in a few days. She&#39;s lucky she didn&#39;t 
have a cut tendon, or anything more serious with the wound being where 
it was. The alcohol sterilized anything that might have gotten into the 
wound, but she did leave herself a nasty burn scar.&quot;

&quot;The Pyro, of all people, should know what&#39;s flammable.&quot; Venus muttered.

&quot;True, but if she hadn&#39;t sealed the wound, she would have bled to death 
Venus.&quot; Mercury replied with a gentle shake of her head. &quot;She really did 
the best thing she could have done in a situation like that. However, 
she did damage a lot of soft tissue, and she&#39;s going to be in extreme 
pain for awhile. That&#39;s why we&#39;re considering keeping her on some opium 
tea.&quot;

&quot;Opium!?&quot; Serenity gasped.

&quot;Yeah, I know.&quot; Mercury said with a smile. &quot;But it&#39;s the strongest pain 
killer we have. So after she wakes up, we&#39;ll all have to keep an eye on 
her.&quot; They all nodded. in agreement.

&quot;Well,&quot; Venus began with a sigh. &quot;now we need to discuss our next issue. 
Judging by the scene of Mars&#39; fight, I think we&#39;re dealing with more 
than a random demon appearance. I&#39;ve spoken with the queen, and we&#39;re 
upping the palace guards by fifty percent.&quot;

&quot;That many?&quot; Jupiter asked, eyebrows furrowed. &quot;You think it&#39;s that 
serious?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no telling, until sleeping beauty wakes up.&quot; Venus replied with 
a smile. &quot;But, it&#39;s better to be safe than sorry.&quot;

Serenity&#39;s eyed widened slightly, and she positioned herself a little 
closer to her soldiers.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Princess.&quot; Mercury said with a smile. &quot;It&#39;ll be ok, we&#39;ll 
protect you, and Mars will wake up soon.&quot;

As if verifying Ami&#39;s prediction, Mars mumbled something in her sleep, 
and smiled.

&quot;What do you think she&#39;s dreaming about?&quot; Serenity asked with a relieved 
smile of her own.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Jupiter replied, &quot;but that is one hell of a grin.&quot;</pre>
