<h1>Jade Emerald</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/drdeath.html">Dr Death DST</a><br> </h2>
<pre>      Rei fell back to the floor awakening from her trance-like state. 
Flames rose and cracked in front of her upon the shrine. A new vision 
had invaded her mind showing her horrible images that had no clear 
meaning. The only thing that was certain is that the scouts had a new 
disturbing enemy to contend with.

      The vision kept replaying in Rei&#39;s head becoming less and less 
detailed as the original. Tears forced their way onto her face feeling 
cool as they rolled down her flushed cheeks. The vision was more 
alarming than the one warning of Dr. Toemo and the Great Silence. How 
long would they have to fight before lasting peace could be obtained?

      Picking herself up off the ground Rei doused the flames with 
water. The fire hissed as it died filling the room with smoke. Rei stood 
still for a moment feeling exhausted as the smoke surrounded her 
ascending to the vent in the ceiling. The smell of charred wood filled 
her senses until Rei could taste it.

      After leaving the meditation chamber Rei headed down the hall to 
take a bath. Her whole body smelled of smoke and ashes. A bath would 
also help ease her mind for now. Rei decided she should gather the other 
scouts after school and tell them about the vision.  

      A few blocks away Makoto and Minako were having dinner. The two 
scouts had become closer friends over the last year since the battle 
with Galaxia. They spent every Tuesday evening together just to hang out 
alone. Tonight they had decided on a simple dinner at Makoto&#39;s since 
they had no money.

      &quot;This is really good Mako,&quot; complimented Mina finishing off the 
last of her rice and grilled fish.

      &quot;It was no problem Mina. Although I should have made the tea 
before cooking dinner so we could&#39;ve drank it with our meal,&quot; Makoto 
tongued the roof of her mouth where she had burned herself with the hot 
tea.

      Mina giggled remembering how Makoto&#39;s face looked when she scalded 
her mouth, &quot;Well that&#39;ll teach you.&quot;

      &quot;I guess so. Now it&#39;s time for your part of the deal,&quot; smiled 
Makoto as Mina pouted. In exchange for Makoto cooking dinner Mina agreed 
to do the dishes, &quot;And you better not put it off like how you left me at 
the movie theatre last week.&quot;

      &quot;How many times must I apologize for that? I just couldn&#39;t pass 
him up you know. You would&#39;ve done the same thing,&quot; whined Mina. Last 
week Mina had met a cute guy on the way to watching a movie with Makoto. 
Being the flirt that Mina is she couldn&#39;t resist stopping and talking to 
him.

      &quot;Just until I get tired of teasing you about it,&quot; laughed Makoto.

      Minako began picking up the dishes off the table and bringing them 
over to the sink, &quot;I&#39;ll make it up to next week. I promise.&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;m sure you will Mina,&quot; Makoto crossed her arms and smirked at 
Mina who returned a friendly glare, Makoto continued, &quot;So how did it 
work out with that guy? Does he have a name?&quot;

      &quot;It isn&#39;t worth remembering or repeating. At the end of the night 
I found out he had a girlfriend. Oh well another disappointment. I&#39;m 
starting to wonder if I&#39;ll ever get a boyfriend,&quot; explained Mina as she 
filled part of the sink up with hot water.

      &quot;Maybe the Goddess of Love and Beauty is too much for any one man 
to handle,&quot; quipped Makoto.

      &quot;That&#39;s not very reassuring,&quot; Mina turned her back to Makoto as 
she began washing.

      &quot;I&#39;m sorry Mina. But I think you do intimidate guys with your 
looks. I know you&#39;ll make some lucky guy real happy someday but, for now 
you got me,&quot; Makoto stood from her seat and walked over to Mina. Makoto 
placed a friendly hand on Mina&#39;s shoulder giving it a squeeze to let her 
know that she was here for her.

      &quot;What about you Mako? Aren&#39;t you lonely?&quot; asked Mina looking into 
the soapy water.

      &quot;I&#39;m fine Mina. I haven&#39;t dated anyone since my old boyfriend but 
I don&#39;t get that lonely even though I am an old romantic. As long as I 
have you and other scouts I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

      Truthfully Makoto was beginning to feel quite lonely especially 
since she had to live on her own. Mina was her closest friend and the 
one she felt most comfortable with opening up to. At one point they 
broke up as friends when Mina had undermined Makoto to gain the 
affection of a young grade school teacher. When the confrontation passed 
it only seemed to bring them closer as friends.

      Makoto at times was self conscious about her looks and how 
feminine she should be. Deep down Makoto was a tomboy at heart. She had 
interests in karate, sports, and wore boyish clothes when at ease. To 
counter this Makoto took interest in what she considered feminine suck 
as, cooking, sewing, gardening, and wearing dresses whenever the 
occasion called for it.

      The other scouts found it hard to believe that Makoto would think 
that she wasn&#39;t feminine. Despite being taller than most guys Makoto was 
unmistakably a pretty girl. Her body was slender and somewhat defined 
but not bulky. Makoto had long thick brown hair that she always kept in 
a pony tail. Sometimes she would wear a baseball cap to hide her frizzy 
hair. Makoto had deep dark green eyes that complimented her shy smile, 
however, she stilled envied the other girls for their smaller frames and 
girly demeanor.

      Of all the girls Makoto envied Minako the most. Minako had the 
look of a model and the personality for it too. Her long blonde silky 
hair extended to the small of her back. Often Mina could coax any guy 
she wanted with her big blue eyes and wide perfect smile. Mina was 
nearly a head smaller than Mako and had a sleek body accompanied by 
smooth skin. All of that beauty comes at a price, Mina&#39;s grades suffered 
due to her excessive concern over her looks and day dreams of being an 
idol.

      Now Makoto moved in closer to Mina and began helping her with the 
dishes much to Mina&#39;s disapproval, &quot;Mako! I&#39;m supposed to be doing 
this.&quot;

      &quot;I know I just want to help,&quot;

      &quot;Okay, then I won&#39;t stop you,&quot;

      Makoto took over washing as Mina moved to drying and putting the 
dishes away. In a few minutes they were done. Afterward Mina went to the 
closet in the living room to grab her coat. Makoto followed to see her 
off.

      &quot;I&#39;d stay longer but we have school in the morning,&quot; said Mina 
slipping each arm into the coat.

      &quot;Since when did you care about school? You&#39;ll be running late with 
Usagi as always,&quot; teased Makoto crossing her arms and looking down at 
Mina.

      &quot;You&#39;re right but its because I stay up with Artemis all night,&quot;

      &quot;What could you possibly be talking about with that cat?&quot;

      &quot;Oh I just tell him about my whole day and how I&#39;m feeling. He&#39;s 
like my personal diary,&quot; Mina laughed at this since Artemis would fall 
asleep sometimes while she jabbered on and on, &quot;We get along so well 
it&#39;s too bad you&#39;re not a boy or I&#39;d date you.&quot;

      &quot;Gee thanks,&quot; muttered Makoto feeling embarrassed and self 
conscious.

      &quot;I didn&#39;t mean it like that Mako-chan,&quot; sputtered Mina realizing 
she had just stuck her foot in her mouth, &quot;I&#39;m just trying to say how 
good of friends we are. Not that you&#39;re boyish.&quot;

      Makoto grabbed Mina and hugged her, &quot;I know Mina thank you. I just 
need to stop worrying about it.&quot;

      With a final extra squeeze they let go of each other. As they 
broke an awkward moment hit them as Makoto nearly kissed Mina. Now they 
both stood there frozen and unnerved by what nearly happened. Both their 
minds were racing trying to figure out what just happened and what to do 
next.

      &quot;I&#39;m... I...,&quot; Makoto stammered unable to explain herself.

      &quot;Did we almost... you know?&quot; Mina didn&#39;t feel angry about it, just 
confused.

      &quot;I&#39;m sorry Mina. For some reason I felt it was the right moment.&quot;

      &quot;Right moment?&quot;

      &quot;Forget it, I&#39;m an idiot,&quot; pleaded Makoto turning to walk away.

      &quot;Talk to me Mako,&quot; Mina grabbed Mako&#39;s hands turning her back 
around, &quot;Do you have feelings for me?&quot;

      &quot;No.. yes. Well maybe,&quot; Makoto desperately wanted to drop it as 
she watched her wide eyed friend look into her face for a real answer.

      &quot;I&#39;m not mad about it Mako. Just tell me the truth. I can&#39;t 
believe you just tried to kiss me and you won&#39;t explain yourself.&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;ve felt this way about you for a while. I never planned to tell 
you or anyone. I have tried to push these feelings below...&quot; Makoto 
trailed off unable to believe that she was telling Mina all of this, &quot;I 
don&#39;t know Mina. It just seemed like you really liked me too and I was 
just acting out of instinct. Please don&#39;t take it personally.&quot;

      &quot;Doesn&#39;t get much more personal than that Mako. But believe me 
that I&#39;m not mad about it, just surprised and caught off guard,&quot; Mina 
tried to calm her friend who was obviously flustered.

      &quot;Please don&#39;t tell anyone about this, not even Artemis,&quot; Makoto 
begged Mina as she fought back her tears.

      Mina took Makoto&#39;s hand, &quot;I promise I won&#39;t say a word. It will be 
our secret.&quot;

      &quot;Thank you Mina. Again I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; Makoto took a few steps back 
and sat onto her couch resting her head on her hand, &quot;I can&#39;t believe I 
did that.&quot;

      &quot;Have you kissed a girl before?&quot; asked Mina wanting to dig more 
information about her friend&#39;s secret life.

      &quot;You really want to know?&quot;

      &quot;Yeah I&#39;m curious.&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;ve really haven&#39;t kissed any girls before. You&#39;re the only one 
I&#39;ve ever felt this way about. Mina we might not have a lot in common 
but we go together really well. I&#39;ve never been this open with anyone 
except maybe Usagi but I have no interest in her that way,&quot; Makoto 
explained her feelings but they just didn&#39;t seem to be coming out right.

      &quot;Awe Mako-chan,&quot; Mina sat next to Makoto putting an arm around her 
friend, &quot;Please cheer up Mako.&quot;

      &quot;You&#39;re just so beautiful and funny Mina. I&#39;d really like to be 
like you.&quot;

      &quot;Hey now, you are great just the way you are Makoto. I wouldn&#39;t 
trade you for anyone,&quot; said Mina sternly.

      &quot;Thanks Mina. You are really sweet. After all we&#39;ve been through 
together I find it hard to like anyone outside our group,&quot; Mako smiled 
at Mina who had a curious look.

      &quot;Have you liked anyone else besides me?&quot;

      Mako laughed at the question but now felt comfortable to say, &quot;I 
think the other girls are cute, especially Rei, but you&#39;re the only one 
I felt strong enough about to pursue,&quot; Mako looked away embarrassed but 
when she looked back Mina had a look that said &#39;go on&#39;, &quot;I&#39;ve been 
really frustrated because of how boy crazy you are and it pains me to 
see them waste an opportunity to hold your hand. As you know you are 
really special to me and my best friend. I feel awful for wanting more 
or jeopardizing our friendship.&quot;

      &quot;Kiss me,&quot; Mina said it simply yet the command had a subtle 
urgency to it.

      &quot;What?&quot; Mako couldn&#39;t believe what she had just heard.

      &quot;Kiss me,&quot; Mina repeated it the exact same way. Everything Makoto 
had just told Mina struck a cord within her heart that forgone 
sexuality.

      Makoto was shocked but wouldn&#39;t disobey. Mina had already begun 
leaning in and Makoto met her halfway. Their lips pressed against each 
other slowly sparking new emotions in both of them. &#39;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m 
actually doing this&#39; thought Makoto as she tried to savor the moment 
that only lasted a few seconds.

      As they broke Mina couldn&#39;t help but smile nearly giggling, &quot;Wow, 
I can&#39;t believe we just kissed.&quot;

      &quot;I was just thinking the same thing,&quot; smiled back Makoto.

      &quot;I actually really liked it. Do you want to do it again?&quot; asked 
Mina sheepishly.

      &quot;Love to,&quot; no sooner had Makoto finished talking Mina moved up and 
kissed her again with a little more force. It was something new that 
neither had experienced before which made it really exciting. They kept 
kissing until they were comfortable enough to kiss open mouth but 
without tongues.

      A few minutes later they broke again. Mina looked happy and dazed 
while Makoto&#39;s face was beaming. Both were surprised by how much each 
other liked kissing and seemed bashful about it. Without saying a word 
Makoto walked Mina up to her apartment door to see her off.

      &quot;Sorry I ended up making you stay later,&quot; Makoto leaned against 
the open door looking at Mina.

      &quot;It&#39;s alright. I&#39;ll think of an excuse on the way home.&quot;

      &quot;Want me to walk you home?&quot;

      Mina smiled widely, &quot;I&#39;m a big girl. If anything happens Sailor 
Venus will surely save me.&quot;

      &quot;Right, right,&quot; nodded Makoto catching Mina&#39;s meaning, &quot;I&#39;ll see 
you at school tomorrow.&quot;

      Mina departed the apartment with a wave and headed home. 

      Usagi, Mina, Ami, and Makoto walked out of the Tenth District High 
School to head for Rei&#39;s temple to study. Today the whole school was 
buzzing about strange events happening in China. The current events 
interested the scouts but didn&#39;t weigh heavily on their minds like the 
other students. After the last battle the scouts felt a sense of 
invincibility. How many times had the scouts been incapacitated or 
killed only to be revived again by Sailor Moon. Nothing it seemed could 
stop them.

      &quot;Mrs. Tanaka is so mean to me!&quot; complained Usagi to no one in 
particular.

      &quot;Well if you showed up to class on time she might be more 
forgiving of your poor scores,&quot; chided Ami.

      &quot;But if Usagi showed up on time then who would I spend detention 
with?&quot; laughed Minako.

      &quot;How about you both show up on time?&quot; Makoto tried to reason but 
knew how they would answer.

      Usagi piped in first, &quot;How about they make school start later?&quot;

      &quot;Honestly you guys need to take your schooling more seriously or 
else how will you make it to college?&quot; asked Ami genuinely concerned.

      &quot;College?&quot; answered both blondes.

      &quot;I don&#39;t need to go to college since I will be a huge pop idol!&quot; 
shouted Mina who stood in a very animated pop star pose.

      &quot;And I&#39;m going to marry Mamoru,&quot; added Usagi wearing a very 
romantic face.

      Ami only shook her head in disappointment in their attitudes. 
Makoto smiled laughing inside at how confident they were. It wouldn&#39;t be 
Usagi and Minako if they weren&#39;t constantly day dreaming and just 
getting by in class.

      A half hour later the group managed to make it to the temple. The 
temple was very spacious for being in Tokyo. A large set of stone steps 
led up to the main courtyard where people could worship. A sizable one 
story building created a square C shape with the courtyard in the 
middle. The middle section of the building housed a shrine and a small 
dojo. Rei&#39;s meditation room was also in this section. The left wing held 
the kitchen, a bathroom, and Rei&#39;s grand-father&#39;s room. The right wing 
contained Rei&#39;s bedroom with an extra bathroom, the rest of the wing was 
filled with storage closets.

      The surrounding area was quite beautiful. A small lake sat to the 
left of the temple while the rest of the property was encircled by trees 
and wildlife. Luckily for Rei the adjacent park didn&#39;t belong to the 
temple relieving her of doing park maintenance.

      When the scouts reached the top of the stairs they found Rei 
working in the courtyard. Rei&#39;s school was close by allowing her to get 
home in time to do a few chores. She wore her red and white miko outfit 
that identified Rei as a shrine maiden. At the moment Rei was sweeping 
the stone courtyard a very tedious daily chore.

      &quot;Hi Rei!&quot; yelled Usagi despite being ten feet away.

      &quot;Hi guys. I have something important to tell you.&quot;

      &quot;What is it Rei?&quot;

      &quot;I had a vision and I think we have another enemy. I&#39;ll give you 
the details in my room,&quot; explained Rei solemnly.

      This spooked everyone but didn&#39;t raise any alarms. After Galaxia 
there wasn&#39;t anything they couldn&#39;t handle. 

      Rei entered her room where the other scouts had already sat 
themselves around her center table, &quot;I put some tea on but it will be a 
moment,&quot; said Rei sitting down across from Usagi.

      &quot;What&#39;s up Rei?&quot; asked Makoto intently.

      &quot;Last night I had a terrible vision. I thought about not telling 
you but I don&#39;t it would&#39;ve been wise to ignore it. Especially after the 
incident with Dr. Toemo,&quot; Rei kept her eyes fixed on a flaw in the grain 
of the table as she talked.

      &quot;Was the vision very specific about our new enemy?&quot; asked Ami with 
her computer in hand to enter any useful information on the enemy.

      &quot;It wasn&#39;t very clear but it started with a bright flash ripping 
the sky open. From it poured out thousands of stone figures wielding 
blades. All of the scouts were there including Tuxedo Mask. We fought 
them hard but there was a dark evil figure the moved amongst us. The 
whole scene was very loud with explosions like lightening. But this 
figure would move to each scout slaying us until we were all dead,&quot; 
Rei&#39;s eyes watered from recalling the vision.

      &quot;We should be fine,&quot; quipped Usagi.

      Rei&#39;s jaw just about hit the floor as she slammed a fist down on 
the table, &quot;We should be fine? What are you talking about?&quot;

      &quot;There&#39;s nothing I can&#39;t do as long as you guys believe in me,&quot; 
said Usagi with a little arrogance.

      &quot;We should take every enemy very seriously whether they are a 
threat or not,&quot; stated Ami equally annoyed with Usagi&#39;s indifference to 
Rei&#39;s warning.

      &quot;Well just have to keep our eyes open for anything that resembles 
Rei&#39;s vision,&quot; said Makoto trying to stay level headed among the group.

      &quot;I&#39;m so sick of fighting,&quot; Mina looked down with a sad expression, 
&quot;I am really tired of people trying to take over the Earth. Once we beat 
this enemy there will just be another to take its place.&quot;

      &quot;That why we have to keep fighting,&quot; retorted Rei, &quot;We just can&#39;t 
let anyone come here and do what they want. It&#39;s either fight or die.&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s not always so black and white. Like Makoto said we will just 
have to wait and see,&quot; explained Usagi, &quot;I wish Luna was here to help 
explain all this.&quot;

      &quot;Where is she anyway?&quot;

      &quot;On a date with Artemis,&quot;

      &quot;Oh... Really?&quot;

      &quot;Yeah he was very meticulous in cleaning himself this morning,&quot; 
laughed Minako.

      &quot;That&#39;s so cute,&quot; sighed Usagi.

      Moving off topic the girls managed to get back their studies. Ami 
provided tutoring to Usagi which was difficult for Ami since Usagi&#39;s 
attention span was less than a second. Minako tried hard to follow along 
but like Usagi would simply titter off about something totally 
unrelated.

      During all this Makoto slid over to Rei&#39;s side to compare notes on 
history. Rei went to a different school but the material was very 
similar. The period of history Makoto was in, Rei&#39;s class had already 
gone over making Rei a great asset. Makoto enjoyed talking to Rei but 
they never seemed to &#39;connect&#39;. They had only hung out with each other a 
hand full of times the entire time they had known each other. As scouts 
they still had a sacred bond as with all the others but never hit it off 
socially.

      &quot;Hey Rei turn on your television,&quot; Rei&#39;s grandfather popped into 
the room with a worried look on his face.

      &quot;What&#39;s going on grandpa?&quot; asked Rei with a hint of annoyance from 
her grand-dad&#39;s intrusion.

      &quot;War, that&#39;s what&#39;s going on,&quot; he spouted in his old rusty voice 
as he came into the room to turn the TV on himself. He was a very short 
old man and bald. Despite his physical looks Rei&#39;s grandpa was quite 
capable of taking care of himself. A little over a couple years ago he 
had put a good fight against Zoicite before being turned into a monster.

      The television crackled to life. A random anime show popped onto 
the screen but grandpa changed the channel before anyone could identify 
it. Eventually he found the news station. At the moment the news was 
broadcasting images of two women emerging from the Forbidden City in 
China. Four statue like soldiers wielding ancient looking spears stood 
behind them. One woman stood further out than the other. She wore a 
brilliant yellow dress decorated with various Chinese symbols. The other 
stood at her side but slightly back. This other woman had a very dark 
demeanor, wearing a tight red and blue tunic.

      Rei&#39;s eyes nearly popped out of her head when she saw the stone 
men, &quot;That&#39;s them! From my vision!&quot;

      &quot;What&#39;s that dear?&quot; asked her grandpa placing a hand on her head.

      &quot;Oh nothing Mr. Hino,&quot; Makoto chimed in, &quot;She just had a nightmare 
last night and was telling us about it.&quot;

      &quot;Hmm, maybe I should take better care of what you watch on TV,&quot; 
said Mr. Hino with concern.

      &quot;Grandpa! I don&#39;t need you to censor what I watch. I totally fine 
thank you,&quot; embarrassment made Rei&#39;s face red as the other scouts 
snickered about Rei being babied.

      A man narrating the news interrupted the Rei&#39;s humiliation, &quot;What 
you&#39;re seeing here is the completion of a coup. These two women you see 
here are the leaders of the coup against the Chinese communist 
government. The woman in the yellow dress has declared herself as 
Empress Sun Lian. The other has not spoken yet,&quot; The women appeared to 
be waving to a crowd below and out of view of the camera.

      &quot;Well I thought it was important for you two to know,&quot; said Mr. 
Hino as he left the girls.

      &quot;Who cares that&#39;s in China,&quot; blurted Mina.

      &quot;Mina!&quot; everyone exclaimed at how lethargic Mina was.

      &quot;We&#39;re certainly not going to go over to China to deal with it. 
For all we know this has nothing to do with us. Maybe Rei&#39;s vision was 
about someone else?&quot; reasoned Makoto.

      Rei shot Makoto a glare for criticizing her abilities, &quot;It was us 
getting killed off in the dream. That I am sure of. Who else would it be 
about?&quot; she now turned to Usagi, &quot;However, we should probably sit and 
wait to see how this affects you.&quot;

      &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Usagi looked puzzled.

      &quot;I think Rei means if these women pose any threat to you,&quot; 
clarified Ami.

      &quot;Our main duty is to protect you meatball head,&quot; scoffed Rei, &quot;As 
long as they stay in China it shouldn&#39;t be of any our concern.&quot;

      &quot;Thanks guys,&quot; Usagi gave everyone her innocent smile, &quot;Now let&#39;s 
stop talking about this depressing stuff and go get some ice cream!&quot;

      &quot;Alright! Let&#39;s go!&quot; Mina grabbed Usagi&#39;s arm pulling her up from 
the table.

      &quot;But guys we haven&#39;t got anything done,&quot; Ami warned but it was too 
late as the blondes headed out to the court yard.

      &quot;Forget it Ami there&#39;s nothing that can stop those two&#39;s 
stomachs,&quot; said Rei with a smirk.

      &quot;Shall we go?&quot; asked Makoto throwing her books in her backpack 
knowing they would say yes.

      &quot;I suppose so,&quot; Ami reluctantly answered.

      &quot;You guys go ahead I don&#39;t feel like eating,&quot; Rei began picking up 
around her room.

      &quot;You sure?&quot;

      &quot;Yeah you guys go ahead.&quot; 

      Makoto walked with Ami behind Usagi and Minako heading for the 
coffee shop. During the stroll Makoto couldn&#39;t seem to keep her eyes off 
of Minako. She kept replaying the night before in her head over and 
over. Did that really happen? Was it just for fun or something more? 
Does she still feel the same? So many questions that Makoto wanted to 
ask but couldn&#39;t in front of her other friends. Even if they were alone 
together Makoto would still find it hard to speak out.

      Possibly sensing Makoto&#39;s eyes upon her Minako looked over her 
shoulder and shot a friendly smile back at Makoto. Returning the smile 
Makoto continued to look on. Her eyes drifted from the back of Mina&#39;s 
head down to her hips swaying in her blue skirt. Blushing deeply Mako 
looked away feeling a little ashamed. She had never looked at her friend 
that way before nor any girl really.

      Once inside the shop Makoto made sure to grab a seat next to Mina 
in a booth. Usagi and Ami sat across from them. Shortly Elizabeth jumped 
over to the table to take everyone&#39;s order which was the usual milk 
shake. The atmosphere had changed considerably for the better since 
being at Rei&#39;s temple.

      &quot;What should we do for the rest of the day?&quot; Usagi threw out there 
for anyone to answer.

      &quot;I know what I&#39;m going to do,&quot; Ami said simply without looking up 
from her book.

      &quot;I&#39;m not sure Usagi. I do have some housework to do at home,&quot; said 
Makoto who was working on being more intimate with Mina.

      Makoto wanted to check to see if Mina still felt the same way or 
if it was just a fluke. Doing so was problematic since the subject is 
very personal and somewhat taboo.  Makoto looked at her blonde friend 
while thinking of a way. Mina was chatting away with Usagi when Makoto 
noticed that Mina&#39;s hands were on her lap. Under the table Makoto placed 
her hand on the seat in a space between her thigh and Mina&#39;s. Slowly 
Makoto gravitated her hand towards Mina&#39;s to take hold of it.

      &quot;Here&#39;s your shakes,&quot; stated Elizabeth cheerfully setting a tray 
down on the table.

      Mina pulled her hands up to take hold of a milk shake as Elizabeth 
distributed them. Only a second away from taking Mina&#39;s hand Makoto 
unconsciously blurted out in frustration, &quot;Damn it.&quot;

      &quot;Something wrong?&quot; Elizabeth looked on Makoto as did everyone else 
in bewilderment.

      Feeling like she had been caught red handed Makoto&#39;s face went 
bright red, &quot;Oh... uh, sorry. I had just remembered something.&quot;

      &quot;Like what?&quot;

      &quot;Uh... I, don&#39;t worry about it. It&#39;s nothing I swear. I just need 
to clean my apartment,&quot; Makoto finally finished her sentence leaving the 
group in wasted suspense.

      &quot;Well that&#39;s no reason to blurt out obscenities,&quot; Usagi corrected.

      &quot;So what are you guys up to today?&quot; asked Elizabeth picking the 
tray up.

      &quot;We were just discussing that,&quot; Usagi slurped on her straw.

      &quot;Maybe we could go shopping,&quot; grinned Mina as she placed her hands 
below the table again.

      This time Makoto decided to just go for it. She moved her forearm 
over to Mina&#39;s lap trying to not move her entire arm so it wouldn&#39;t 
appear that anything was going on. Blindly searching for Mina&#39;s hand 
Makoto first placed her hand on Mina&#39;s wrist then slid up to her hand.

      A gasp escaped Mina&#39;s lips prompting Usagi to question, &quot;What&#39;s up 
Mina?&quot;

      &quot;Oh nothing,&quot;

      &quot;Nothing?&quot;

      &quot;Yeah don&#39;t worry about it,&quot;

      &quot;First Mako and now you. You guys are up to something,&quot; Usagi 
leaned towards them giving them a suspicious look.

      Quickly both girls let go under the table. Makoto felt embarrassed 
by Usagi&#39;s questioning. Mina looked up at Makoto with an uneasy smile. 
&#39;I hope I didn&#39;t upset her&#39; wondered Makoto.

      &quot;Really Usagi leave them alone. You&#39;re always so nosy,&quot; Ami 
unknowingly came to their rescue.

      &quot;Oh I was just curious,&quot; whined Usagi causing the other girls to 
giggle a little.

      Feeling more relaxed Mina slid her hand over to Makoto&#39;s side 
tapping her on the thigh. Looking down through her peripheral Makoto saw 
Mina&#39;s open hand and gladly placed her own in it. They interlocked their 
fingers and gave a gentle squeeze of affection. For the rest of the 
visit they remained that way.

      &quot;I need to get home and finish a paper,&quot; sighed Ami secretly 
wanting to put off homework for a little longer.

      &quot;I should probably do that too,&quot; laughed Usagi.

      Giving Usagi a stern look Ami replied, &quot;We both know you won&#39;t.&quot;

      &quot;Yeah, yeah. I&#39;m sure Minako and I can find something to do,&quot; 
suggested Usagi.

      &quot;Well actually...&quot; Mina paused looking at Makoto, &quot;I was just 
thinking about maybe helping Makoto clean up.&quot;

      &quot;Clean up? I&#39;m not in the mood for doing house work, or homework. 
Maybe Mamoru will have some time for me,&quot; blabbered Usagi.

      &quot;You don&#39;t have to help Mina,&quot; Makoto knew that her apartment 
wasn&#39;t messy at all.

      &quot;No I want to. Who knows, it could be fun,&quot; Mina bit her bottom 
lip seductively towards Makoto.

      Makoto looked baffled but nodded her head in agreement. The other 
girls looked puzzled as well but never considered what could be going 
on. On that note the group parted ways heading for home. After paying of 
course. 

      &quot;Wow your apartment is really dirty,&quot; Mina commented sarcastically 
on Makoto&#39;s very clean living room, &quot;It almost looks the way I left it 
yesterday.&quot;

      &quot;I couldn&#39;t come up with a better excuse. Anyway, do you want 
something to eat?&quot; Makoto plopped down on her couch and basically only 
place to sit.

      Mina sat beside Makoto, &quot;Excuse for what?&quot;

      &quot;Earlier I had tried to hold your hand but you had moved it when 
the milk shakes came,&quot; Makoto looked to the floor feeling a bit cheesy.

      &quot;That&#39;s sweet,&quot; smiled Mina reaching for Makoto&#39;s hand.

      &quot;Are we together?&quot; Makoto suddenly asked and the question took 
Mina a little by surprise as she had not thought of it.

      &quot;Together... I&#39;m not sure Mako-chan,&quot; Mina looked away for a bit 
to think but the answer wouldn&#39;t come only a question, &quot;What would the 
others think?&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;m not sure. Right now I only care about what you think,&quot; Makoto 
said it sincerely enough that Mina knew it was the truth.

      Mina couldn&#39;t help but be captivated by Makoto&#39;s green 
affectionate eyes. Was she falling in love? The bond of friendship was 
there. A history of fighting, sweating, and even dying together stood 
behind them. Was it enough to ratify a relationship between two women? 
Mina&#39;s mind raced as the tension built up inside of her. She was the 
Goddess of Love and Beauty. How could she accept one type of love and 
not another?

      Makoto could see the conflict within Mina. She wanted to be able 
to tell Mina that it wasn&#39;t a big deal but how could she? So much could 
change or would it? Too much was uncertain. Makoto had been having this 
battle within her for a couple years but it was just beginning for Mina.

      Drawn in by the tension they locked lips and embraced one another. 
For Makoto it was sweet bliss to be kissing Mina. It was how soft Mina&#39;s 
lips were, the taste of her peach chap stick, even the hint of saliva, 
everything about it made Makoto feel good. She even timed her breathing 
so she could take in Mina&#39;s breath as she breathed out.

      The wet smacking sound of their lips heightened as the kiss 
intensified. Makoto began to gently lean back pulling Mina on top of 
her. They never broke the kiss and continued to do so. The moment seemed 
to last for half an hour but when they finally broke only five minutes 
had gone by.

      After breaking the kiss, Mina lay her head down on Makoto&#39;s chest 
with a big sigh, &quot;Yeah I&#39;d say we&#39;re together.&quot;

      This made Makoto smile widely. If someone had told her that Minako 
would be her girlfriend a couple days ago Makoto would have thought they 
were crazy. Right now she wanted nothing more than to remain there 
laying with her blonde friend. What could be in store for them now?</pre>
