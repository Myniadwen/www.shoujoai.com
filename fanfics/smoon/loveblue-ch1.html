<h1>Love is Blue (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/madpanda.html">MadPanda</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The bottom of a pool is a strange place to work out a problem, but there 
sat Ami Mizuno, doing just that.  She loved the quiet, the solitude, the 
pressure, and yes, the challenge.  The idea was to focus on two things 
at once: solve the problem at hand, and do so before she needed to 
surface, forcing her to think faster.  Not that she couldn&#39;t process 
information; the petite, blue-haired young woman had immeasurable 
intelligence.  On some matters, though, she could be rather clueless.  
Love was one such matter, and try as she might, this was one problem 
that wasn&#39;t going to be solved sitting on the bottom of a pool.

Michiru Kaioh watched the young blunette and smiled.  The two had 
parlayed their swimming rivalry into a pretty good friendship, and she 
regarded Ami as a younger sister, or maybe even a younger, more 
analytical version of herself.  If Ami had a problem she couldn&#39;t solve 
(which was rare in itself), Michiru would gently offer advice - but 
never a solution.  Michiru stood from the chaise lounge and looked into 
the water.  &quot;The poor dear,&quot; she sighed with a smile.  &quot;I&#39;d better fish 
her out before she grows fins and a tail.&quot;

&#39;Makoto...why, no, how can I tell you?  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve guessed by now 
how I feel about you...you&#39;re always there for me; you&#39;re always smiling 
and caring with me, even when you&#39;re having problems of your own.  I&#39;d 
even go so far as to say you...no, I shouldn&#39;t make such an assumption.  
What if I&#39;m wrong?   I mean, the way you act around me seems to be the 
way someone would act if they&#39;re interested in me that way...I guess.  
Watching your interaction with me is very much like watching Mamoru&#39;s 
behavior with Usagi.  He&#39;s very protective of her.  He does his best to 
make her happy, and even when he&#39;s not there, she&#39;s happy just thinking 
about him.&#39;  Ami sighed and watched the bubbles rise to the surface.  &#39;I 
feel your affection, Mako-chan...but I...I don&#39;t know how to show you 
that I feel the same way.  Expressing myself in mere words wouldn&#39;t do 
my feelings justice.  You&#39;re beyond that.  And besides, even Shakespeare 
or Browning would probably have just as hard a time with you.   My 
father was the artist, but I don&#39;t have his talent.  As beautiful as his 
landscapes are, I don&#39;t think he could truly capture you.  I could 
probably compose a song, but it would take a symphony with the strength 
of Wagner and the beauty of Debussy.  I couldn&#39;t possibly do that.  You 
truly have me at a loss, my dearest Mako-chan...&#39;

Ami&#39;s thoughts were interrupted as she felt herself being lifted up 
through the water&#39;s surface.  She took a much-needed breath and turned 
to see Michiru smiling at her, her aqua-hued tresses floating behind 
her.

&quot;Air is a necessary component for human life.  You really shouldn&#39;t try 
cutting down on it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Michiru-san,&#39; said Ami between breaths, &quot;I was--&quot;

&quot;Using your proven method of problem-solving, right?  Honestly, one day 
you&#39;ll be so immersed in your thoughts that your skin color will match 
your hair color.&quot;

&quot;Then at least I will be color-coordinated and problem-free!&quot;  They both 
laughed softly, but Ami trailed hers off and sighed..

&quot;Why should love be so hard, Michiru-san?&quot;

&quot;For many reasons,&quot; Michiru answered, holding out her hand to count. 
&quot;It&#39;s worthwhile, it&#39;s important, it&#39;s special, it&#39;s necessary, it&#39;s 
practical...I&#39;m going to need my other hand.  You promise not to sink if 
I let you go?&quot;

Ami had forgotten she was still being held by Michiru.  She blushed and 
swam to the edge of the pool.  &quot;Okay, I get it.  People do have trouble 
expressing their feelings to the person they love.  But why should it be 
so difficult?  Shouldn&#39;t they be able to just say &#39;I love you&#39; and be 
done with it?&quot;

Michiru glided aside her.  &quot;Now how would you feel if someone just 
walked up to you and said &#39;I love you&#39; without any hesitation, with no 
concern or feeling other than the words themselves?  Most likely, you 
wouldn&#39;t believe them, because the feeling wasn&#39;t there.  You know 
better than most that humans communicate their feelings in many 
different ways, and in many different combinations.  Finding the right 
way to express your love and win someone&#39;s heart shouldn&#39;t be easy...it 
should be a fight.&quot;  She paused to reflect on her own struggles with 
winning Haruka&#39;s heart, the difficult choices she made in doing so, and 
the reward of not only having a lover and a fellow senshi to fight 
alongside her, but a life partner as well.  &quot;It is worth the fight, 
Ami-chan.  Trust me, when you find the right way to tell that person how 
you feel, you will, and you&#39;ll be more than satisfied with the results.&quot;

Ami looked at Michiru with awe.  Indeed, Michiru and Haruka had a love 
that she and the rest of her friends envied.  Those two would walk by, 
and everyone knew how much they were in love without them having to say 
a word.  They just seemed to radiate love, if that was possible.  She 
wanted something like that, and she knew who with.  &quot;Thank you, 
Michiru-san,&quot; Ami bowed her head just above the water&#39;s surface and 
back.  &quot;I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll find a way.  I just wished I could do it soon.  I 
don&#39;t want to lose her.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Ami-chan.  If you love her that much, I&#39;m sure she&#39;s 
noticed even a little. You&#39;ll find a way, and if she truly loves you, 
she&#39;ll wait forever for you.&quot;  Michiru climbed out of the pool and 
offered Ami a helping hand.  &quot;By the way, do you know how long you were 
down there?&quot;

&quot;I lost track after three minutes, why?&quot;

&quot;Because you were past five minutes when I came in to get you, and you 
didn&#39;t seem to be having any trouble.&quot;  Michiru watched the surprised 
look on Ami&#39;s face as an idea came her mind.  &quot;Have you ever heard of 
the Kondo Ballet?&quot;

&quot;Wh-what?  Five minutes??&quot;  Ami knew she was there for awhile, but not 
that long.  &quot;Hmm...I didn&#39;t feel any effects from the lack of oxygen.  
It could be due to being a senshi...&quot; She was lost in her self-analysis 
when Michiru repeated her question.

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me being down that long has affected your hearing!  Have you 
ever heard of Kondo?&quot;

&quot;Oh-I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Ami replied with a blush.  &quot;Yes, I have heard of Kondo.  
My father used to take me to see the performances.  It was very 
beautiful....  I had seen old film of the underwater ballet before, but 
it was nothing like attending it in person.  I was saddened when they 
closed down a few years ago.&quot;

&quot;Then I have good news.  Haruka and I are reviving the company,&quot; Michiru 
said nonchalantly.  &quot;We&#39;ve been talking with the company for quite 
awhile, and they&#39;ve been very receptive.  In fact, they&#39;ve already given 
us the use of their theater.  We&#39;re done refurbishing it, and are 
looking for performers.  Would you be interested?&quot;

Ami&#39;s heart almost leapt out of her mouth before rationality forced it 
back into its proper place.  &quot;I...I don&#39;t know.  I don&#39;t think I could 
perform in front of a crowd.  Besides, there&#39;s many hours of training 
that would be needed for something like that, not to mention the ability 
to move that gracefully underwater.  You have that talent naturally, 
Michiru-san, being a water senshi.  I do not.  Thank you very much for 
considering me, but I don&#39;t think I could.&quot;

Michiru read Ami&#39;s downcast expression and tried another tack...&quot;You&#39;d 
be surprised what you&#39;re capable of, Ami-chan.  Don&#39;t forget, you&#39;re 
also a water senshi, only you manipulate it in a completely different 
way.  You&#39;re an excellent swimmer and a graceful dancer.  Putting those 
skills together shouldn&#39;t be a problem for you.  I can see this is 
something you might like, and I&#39;m sure you have the talent, even if 
you&#39;re not.  Humor me....  Come by the theater, and we&#39;ll talk more 
about it, okay?&quot;

&quot;Well, I guess talking about it doesn&#39;t constitute a commitment.  I&#39;ll 
do that, then.&quot;  Ami smiled and joined Michiru outside of the pool.

After awhile Ami prepared to leave.  &quot;Thank you again for listening to 
me, and for your help.&quot;  She bowed deeply to Michiru, who smiled warmly 
before doing likewise.

&quot;Thank you for listening to me.  Remember what I said, Ami-chan; she&#39;ll 
wait for you to be ready, so don&#39;t give up the fight.&quot;

Ami smiled and nodded, and turned to go.  Before she did, she took a 
long look at one of the many paintings Michiru had displayed in her home 
In it, a terrible storm was raging against a jetty.  Amidst the turmoil, 
Michiru as a mermaid sat with a hand extended to welcome Haruka, dressed 
in a billowing gold and white gown and floating down to meet Michiru.  
Even there, their love shone around them, and their expressions were 
peaceful and calm.  Ami marveled at the detail, the colors, the deftness 
of the brushstrokes, the symbolism....and then she took a step back and 
saw the whole painting.  &#39;That&#39;s what I want,&#39; she thought to herself.  
&#39;A love like that...to say it just like that.&quot;</pre>
