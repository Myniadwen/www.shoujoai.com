<h1>And the Desert Roars (part 12 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/arashi.html">arashi-enkou</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/desertroars-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Ami blinked her eyes open as she realized that she was back in the 
present. Groaning, she sat up and winced as the bright, morning sun 
flashed in her eyes. She gasped and struggled to her feet.

&quot;Makoto!&quot; she hissed to the still slumbering genie. &quot;Wake up! Wake up!&quot; 
The brunette whimpered and opened her jade eyes. &quot;What time is it?&quot; she 
slurred.

&quot;I need to see if it worked!&quot; Ami cried in desperstion. MAkoto blinked 
and suddenly, understanding lit up her eyes. She quickly whisked Ami 
into her arms and concentrated on Rei and Usagi. With a swirl of magic, 
they were off. ::---::

Ami smiled as she saw the reincarnations of the princess and the desert 
warrior snuggle below them. &quot;That&#39;s so sweet.&quot; Ami giggled. Makoto 
wrinkled her nose at the open affection.

&quot;They don&#39;t have any dignity.&quot; 


:::---:::

Usagi sighed and nuzzeled closer to her raven haired girlfriend. Burying 
her face in Rei&#39;s neck, she let out a contented sigh, delighting in the 
way the girl suddered.

&quot;Usa,&quot; Rei reprimanded lightly. &quot;Stop.&quot; The blonde giggled, making the 
violet eyed girl shiver again. &quot;Why?&quot; Usagi asked slyly. &quot;You know you 
like it.&quot; Rei stuttered and looked away as a rosy blush covered her 
cheeks. &quot;Do not.&quot;

&quot;Do to.&quot; Usagi sang as she tugged gently on her love&#39;s black hair.

&quot;Do not dumpling head.&quot; Usagi gasped and placed a hand over her heart, 
as if wounded. &quot;Rei! You haven&#39;t called me that since--&quot;

&quot;Elementary school.&quot; The other girl muttered. The blonde grinned again 
and gently poked Rei in her side, her grin nearly breaking her face at 
the adorable little giggle that spilled from Rei&#39;s lips. Rei gasped and 
clamped a hand over her mouth, looking at Usagi with panic in her eyes.

Her girlfriend&#39;s evil smile chilled Rei to the bone.

&quot;W-why are you looking at me like that?&quot; Rei stammered. &quot;Usa? Ah!&quot; Usagi 
pounced, her hands finding all the ticklish spots on Rei&#39;s sides, making 
the other girl squeal in laughter. Rei sprang from the park bench, away 
from Usagi, and pelted toward the apartment that they shared. Usagi 
laughed and ran after her.

Rei made sure to not lock the door, Usagi noticed as she walked inside. 
She didn&#39;t turn on the light either. That was weird. Slowly, she made 
her way to the hallway, where she could at least turn on the light. As 
she walked by the bedroom, hands shot out and grasped her waist, 
dragging her into the bedroom. She shrieked and was filled with terror 
as her captor slammed the door shut and pinned her to it. When familiar 
lips covered hers, all fear bled out and she moaned, wraping her arms 
around Rei&#39;s neck.

&quot;You scared me half to death,&quot; Usagi murmured against Rei&#39;s lips. She 
heard a chuckle, followed by more kisses. &quot;Payback for remembering my 
tickle spot.&quot; Then, the playfullness ended, and Rei began to kiss her 
much more desprately. It was always like this on their anniversary. For 
some reason, Rei was fiercly overprotective of her little bunny, and on 
one or more occasion, much more reluctant to let Usagi out of the bed.

Not that the blonde would ever complain, but it was strange.

&quot;What are you so afraid of Rei?&quot; Usasgi groaned as the raven haired girl 
trailed kisses up and down her neck. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; came the honest 
answer. &quot;It&#39;s just,&quot; she paused to kiss Usagi again, a quick meeting of 
lips, &quot;I feel like someone&#39;s going to take you away from me.&quot; She framed 
the blonde&#39;s face in her hands. &quot;I don&#39;t want to lose you little 
kitten.&quot; Usagi blinked. &quot;Where did that come from?&quot; Her lover seemed 
equally confused.

&quot;Ah...I just...For some reason I--&quot; She was cut off as Usagi pulled her 
down into a fierce kiss. &quot;Ti amer&ograve; per sempre, o mia dea del Sole...&quot; 
Rei whispered as they seperated.

&quot;I didn&#39;t know you knew Italian.&quot; Usagi murmured as she laid her head on 
Rei&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;I didn&#39;t know I knew Italian either.&quot; Rei chuckled.

The Desert contains many mysertries. But perhaps the most compelling 
mystery of them all...is the mystery of love.

::::: The End :::::

Preview for the sequel:: Bloodred Sunsets

&quot;Who are you!?&quot; Rei snarled to the three women in front of her. A woman 
with long, violet hair and lily white eyes spoke. &quot;M-My name is H-Hyugga 
H-Hinata.&quot; she whispered with a hint of pink on her pale cheeks.

&quot;My name&#39;s Higurashi Kagome!&quot; said a woman with ebony , shoulder length 
hair and twinkling blue eyes. The final woman, a tall one at that with 
silky obsidian strands of hair spoke. &quot;Tifa Lockheart. Pleasure to meet 
you.&quot;

&quot;W-Why are we h-here?&quot; Came the nearly inaudible question of Hinata.

&quot;Why, you&#39;re here to die of course...&quot; said a snake-like voice.</pre>
