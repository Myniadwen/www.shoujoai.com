<h1>Love Is A Furious Flame</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shooting147.html">Shootingstar147</a><br> </h2>
<p><font size="3" face="Courier New">Ah springtime!  A time when 
a young man&#39;s fancy turns to love...or at least that&#39;s what people say 
but whether or not its true is a whole other story!</font> <br>
</p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Courier New">My 
name is Mizuno Ami and my sign is Virgo.  I was born on September 
10<sup>th</sup> and my mother is a famous doctor.  I had aspirations 
of one day being like her when I grew up but something happened that 
changed my life forever!</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Courier New">I 
guess you could say it all started one day when Tuskino-san and I had 
just gotten out of school for the day.  I was heading to the Alto 
Seminar when Usagi suggested stopping at the Hikawa Shrine to visit 
Rei-Chan.  I wanted to protest because of the time that I had missed 
Cram School for her pajama party but agreed under the condition that 
it was just a brief visit.  Usagi agreed and off we went.  
When we got to the Temple Rei was sweeping away the leaves that had 
fallen and smiled as we appeared at the top of the stairs.</font> <br>

</p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Courier New">&quot;Konnichiwa 
Usagi-chan!&quot; She exclaimed as Usagi approached and greeted me with 
the formal &quot;Mizuno-san&quot; as she became quick to use whenever 
around me.  I guess it only seemed fair as I always used formal 
greetings when I met up with the girls for the whatever we did.  
As I came closer Rei seemed to blush a little bit.  This happened 
a few times since after the costume party when we helped Tuskino-san 
take down the youma and Rei and I had a kind of &quot;Heart to Heart&quot; 
as some would call it.  Since that day whenever she saw me something 
seemed to come over her and I alwaus seemed to wonder if she was coming 
down with a sickness.  Usagi on the other hand was always oblivious 
to it as was the case today</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Courier New">&quot;How 
have things been around here Rei?  Been busy at all?&quot; Usagi 
asked and Rei just politely said no.  Ever since the incident with 
the missing girls and despite the fact that her name was cleared of 
any wrong doing there were people that still didn&#39;t like her for thinking 
she was &quot;cursed&quot;.  Usagi and I both knew differently 
but it was always hard to convince Rei to do certain things.  Would 
you believe she still refuses to do karaoke?!  If anyone should 
be paranoid about Karaoke it should be me but I sang in front of Naru 
and Usagi and it didn&#39;t bother me one bit.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New">Sorry...went off on a bit of a 
tangent there!</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Courier New">15 
Minutes past and we helped Hino-san for a little bit before I headed 
off to the Seminar leaving Tuskino-san and Rei-san alone.  Usagi 
waited for just as I disappeared down the stairs to get to asking Rei 
about her &quot;unusual behaviour&quot;.  &quot;Rei-chan&quot; 
Usagi began &quot;what&#39;s up with you and Ami?&quot; She asked matter 
of factly and Rei&#39;s head shot faster than a lawn dart!  &quot;Nothing 
Usagi.  Why?  What do you THINK is up?&quot; Rei asked pointedly 
and this caused Usagi to take a step back for a second.</font> <br>

</p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Courier New">&quot;Oh 
no I wasn&#39;t trying to imply anything Rei-chan but it seems whenever 
Ami&#39;s around you get a little...flushed I guess is the term.&quot; Usagi 
explained and Rei knew that when Usagi made her mind up about something 
there was no changing it.  &quot;It&#39;s just...I don&#39;t know how to 
explain it Usagi.  Ami&#39;s a good girl and her life is not one anyone 
should have to go through.  Not her, not Mako-chan ,not anyone!&quot; 
Rei exclaimed and this left Usagi in some serious thought.  What 
did Rei know that Usagi didn&#39;t?  Usagi was going to press on but 
thought better of it and went home to eat dinner.</font> <br>
</p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Courier New">That 
night while I was at the Seminar I couldn&#39;t help but glance at a picture 
that was taken of Hino-san and myself at an amusement park.  Usagi 
had convinced us that it would have been wise to go have fun and &quot;not 
worry so much about Senshi Business for a day&quot;.  I agreed 
that it would be nice as did Rei and we all had a ball.  Rei won 
this huge stuffed bear and gave it to Usagi while I stuck to some of 
the &quot;tamer&quot; rides and let them be.  As the day wore on 
Rei asked me to go on the Ferris wheel with her.  I agreed and 
Usagi was a little struck dumb this although so was I even though I 
agreed to do it because it is one of the rides that usually is a lot 
of fun to do at the end of the day.</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Courier New">As 
the ride came to a stop Rei was asleep on my shoulder.  This wouldn&#39;t 
have been TOO awkward except for the fact that the next group that was 
going to get into the car was wondering what was going on.  THAT 
group had Motoki, Makoto and Minako in it!</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Courier New"><i>And people wonder why I don&#39;t 
do things like this often</i></font> <br></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Courier New">Back 
in the real world and the class went by with a flash.  I aced the 
mock test that the teacher gave and went home without incident.  
No Youmas, nobody sneaking up on me and no worries!  When I got 
home it was empty like normal and I headed for bed.  Life was as 
it should have been!</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Courier New"><i>That is...until two days later!</i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Courier New">What happened you ask?  Well 
I&#39;ll tell you!</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Courier New">So 
class had adjourned for lunch and I went to my usual space on the roof.  
I was reviewing some of the material from class when I saw Rei&#39;s number 
show up on the Cell Phone.  &quot;Moshi Moshi&quot; I said politely 
while wiping my mouth of the sandwich crumbs that had stuck to my face.  

&quot;Good Afternoon Ami&quot; She began &quot;I was wondering...could 
you come over to the Temple after you get done school today?  I 
want to talk to you about something.&quot; She explained and while I 
wanted to say no she had stated that it was for AFTER cram school ,so 
I agreed to go see her then.</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Courier New">The 
rest of the day was a complete blur and if you asked me to tell you 
all what happened I honestly don&#39;t think that I could tell you all that 
was covered.  When I got to the shrine Rei was looking up into 
the stars when she saw me at the top of the steps and politely greeted 
me as we took our seats on the platform she was sitting on before I 
came.</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Courier New">&quot;Ami&quot; 
She began &quot;have you ever...thought about what its like to be in 
love?&quot; She finished and I had to actually think about this one.  
This wasn&#39;t a question I normally dealt with but when I came up with 
a satisfactory answer I responded to her inquiry.  &quot;No Rei 
I honestly haven&#39;t.  I&#39;ve been busy with school and when we fight 
our enemies helping you guys out that it never really occurred to me.  
Is something wrong Hino-san?&quot; I asked not realizing where this 
was going to go.</font> <br></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Courier New">&quot;Ami...I 
think I&#39;m in love with someone.  The problem is that...I don&#39;t 
know how to tell them and I&#39;m scared of what their reaction might be.  
You understand where I&#39;m coming from right Ami?&quot; She asked and 
I nodded.  I never thought I&#39;d have this kind of conversation with 
Hino-san as the closest we had to anything like this was a conversation 
about just working together as Senshi back when the Silver Crystal was 
out there.  Where was this going?</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Courier New">&quot;Hino-san...I 
know how hard it is for you to open up to people.  When we fought 
the Youma at the party I remember that you didn&#39;t want to sing because 
you aren&#39;t a fan of it.  The fact that you confide in me a lot 
is something that I will always honour and cherish.  If you need 
anything from me you know I&#39;ll be there for you.&quot; I told her as 
I got up and patted her on the shoulder before leaving the Temple for 
the night.  Little did I know that soon Hino-san and I were about 
to start something special!</font> <br></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Courier New">The 
next day was an interesting day as I didn&#39;t have cram school but Luna 
called and there was a Youma attacking at one of the local train stations 
and going towards T*A School!  I quickly changed and made my way 
there with Usagi in tow and when we got there the monster was heaving 
bodies that it had sucked the energy out of and it looked like a massacre 
just minus the blood!  Rei saw the bodies and transformed herself 
as we had a three on one advantage against the creature.  What 
none of us accounted for was the shear fact that this was a powerful 
monster indeed and deflected all of our attacks leaving the walls worse 
for wear.  Little did we that one of US was going to be feeling 
about the same in a minute!</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Courier New">This 
occurred when Mars used the Youma Taizan but got it bounced back.  
The problem was that when it got deflected it came in my direction so 
quick that I flew through the glass and crashed through one of the desks!  
The last thing I could honestly remember before I blacked out was hearing 
the clatter of footsteps which meant the others had arrived.  The 
black void that I entered at that point in time was eerie and I had 
wondered if I was going to leave it when I heard a voice sitting next 
to me.</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Courier New">&quot;Ami-chan...Ami-chan 
wake up please!&quot; I heard the plea of one individual and when I 
awoke I saw Hino-san sitting in a chair next to the bed.  The surroundings 
were a lot different than if I home or even Usagi&#39;s...was I...in her 
bedroom?!  &quot;Rei...oooh!&quot; I said as the effect of crashing 
through the desk had not yet subsided.  &quot;Oh God Ami thank 
God your ok...THANK GOD!!!&quot; Rei nearly yelled almost in tears and 
I did what I could to console her.  I know that it was a pretty 
hefty blast that I took and even I wondered if I was going to make it...but 
this was one reaction from someone like Rei that I never expected!</font> <br>

</p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Courier New">&quot;Rei...how 
long...&quot; I was cut off by Rei&#39;s finger on my lips as she spoke 
&quot;You took a nasty shot from a Youma at my school and we all wondered 
if you...were...&quot; Rei trailed off and I felt bad for her.  
This however brought me back to that conversation we had before and 
the time on the Ferris Wheel and THEN it all started to click for me.  
&quot;Rei I have something I want to ask you.&quot; I told the priestess 
and she sat at attention waiting to hear the question &quot;When you 
said you were in love with someone...let me ask it this way.  Is 
it a girl you&#39;re in love with?&quot; I asked and Rei just politely nodded 
before I continued &quot;Is this girl someone we both know?&quot; I 
asked again and then she started smiling which meant I didn&#39;t have to 
ask the next question because she did it for me.</font> <br></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Courier New">&quot;I 
promised myself I would never fall in love recklessly Mizuno-san.&quot; 
She started &quot;But when I met you and we had that talk that day at 
the costume party something...started to change I guess is the best 
way to put.  I&#39;d sometimes sit in the fire room and just meditate 
and the look on your face was one of innocence and yet also acceptance 
and understanding.  You were so genuine that I wondered what it 
would be like to be closer to you relationshipwise.  When you got 
captured by Kunzite and brainwashed to fight against us I wondered if 
there was ever going to be a chance to tell you how I really felt.  
When you came back to our side I was so happy that I felt like Usagi 
when she became reunited with Endyimon and I wondered aloud how to tell 
you about my feelings.&quot; She explained and I put out a hand to brush 
away the tears that were streaming down her cheek.  She was a good 
person and she deserved as much in return.  I had to tell her the 
truth.</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Courier New">&quot;I 
felt the same way Hino-san.  I also know that we are the same in 
the manner that we are alone a lot more that we should be.  Sure 
we have Usagi and the rest of the senshi but Makoto has Motoki and Usagi 
Mamoru.  I know the feelings you have are genuine and I wanted 
you to know that...I love you Rei Hino.  I love you with all of 
my heart and soul and I will do whatever I can to help protect you when 
the time comes.&quot; I finished and Rei just broke down in tears as 
she placed her head down on the bed and I sat up and stroked her hair 
gently.</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Courier New">It 
would be a day or two before I could return home but I helped Rei out 
around the temple and smiled as we had breakfast together for the first 
time not just as Sailor Senshi but as a couple.  When Usagi came 
over and we told her the news she was extremely happy for us and we 
were relieved.  True Usagi is one of the more accepting people 
we knew but this was something that caught the two of US off guard never 
mind the rest of the crew.  As the day went on the other two girls 
came over to congratulate us and we just smiled politely and thanked 
them.  As night fell over the shrine and we spent the night together 
in Rei&#39;s bed there was one thing she said that forever rang true</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Courier New">&quot;Love is always a furious 
flame&quot;</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Courier New">And hers was never going to be 
put out!</font></p>
