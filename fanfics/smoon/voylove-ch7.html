<p>Preparation  of Self and Comrades</p>
<p>“WHAT! How can  you be so sure? I don't feel anything!”</p>
<p>“Calm down,  Ruka, it's all right, we should have seen this coming in the first  place.”</p>
<p>“How can I be  calm? If what you say is true, the Princess is coming to meet us.   And if she sees us, she'll surely want us back at the Kingdom.”</p>
<p>“Not  necessarily,” Minako objected. “The Princess may have grown up a  little differently than the one you remember. She <em>could</em> just  happen to be crossing our path on her way to visit someone across the  sea.”</p>
<p>Rei scoffed as she  tightened her grip on her arms. “Yeah right. And the only reason  the Princess would set foot into a kitchen is to relay a message.   Why would the other Senshi be with her otherwise?”</p>
<p>“To protect her?   It could be a rather long journey,” Makoto offered.</p>
<p>Haruka still  smoldered with panic. “If she's heard anything about this ship and  its captain, then there's no doubt of her intentions.”</p>
<p>At that, Rei  looked to the sky for the answer to her pondering. Eventually, she  asked Mina, “Say, when <em>was</em> the last time we spoke of Pirates  when the Princess was listening?”</p>
<p>Apparently, Mina  had been thinking of the subject in recent times, as she effortlessly  answered, “We only spoke of it once, just after Mako-chan and  Ruka-chan left us. It was early morning when we realized it and  therefore discussed it, so naturally, the Princess was half-asleep  through it all. By now, I'm thinking Setsuna-san filled her in at  least a little though.”</p>
<p>Suddenly  interested in a possible change of topic, Makoto asked, “What'd you  say when we left?”</p>
<p>Rei glanced at  Makoto then, flashing briefly to Minako and Haruka, before sighing.   “It was very basic, especially on Ami's terms. She told us the  markings of a pirate ship, how to identify a pirate if you ever came  across one, and if you were outnumbered, use a flare and run. Of  course, I'd never see a reason to run from pirates, so it really  didn't matter to me.”</p>
<p>A suspicious gleam  crossed Haruka's expression. “There was more, wasn't there?”</p>
<p>The Senshi of Love  shook her head. “It just so happened to be a busy day then. We  voted to talk about it on a later date, but we never got around to  it.”</p>
<p>There was a long  silence before Makoto nervously prompted, “So... what do we do?   You said Setsuna, Michiru, and Ami are aboard too?”</p>
<p>Rei nodded.   “Their energy signals are undeniable. Especially the Princess'. I  suppose we could try to reason it out with them. Are you sure you'd  be against coming back with us?”</p>
<p>Uranus nodded back  vehemently. “The Kingdom just isn't for me. I'll protect it from  other pillagers and send warning if I catch sight of possible  invaders, but for now, I have no intention of going back. Right  Mako-chan?”</p>
<p>The Senshi of  Lightning remained silent, finding the speck of dust on the deck  utterly captivating. When prompted further for an answer, she only  murmured, “I don't know... probably... sure.”</p>
<p>Sensing her  indecision, Minako softly declared, “You were always meant to be a  part of the Princess' private guard, Mako-chan. It's only natural  for you to feel a bit of indecision now.”</p>
<p>A gruff nod from  Rei was noted before she straightened and stood up. “I'll act as a  messenger. Something tells me that out of all of us, the Princess  and Setsuna-san will react best if I'm the one to tell them.”</p>
<p>At that, Mina  stood up as well. “Tell them what?”</p>
<p>Rei sighed and  turned to face all of them. “We're going to stick together at the  very least, until Mina's birthday comes along. Any matters  considering the placement of the two pirate Senshi are to be resolved  then and only then with the Princess or not at all. The two of us  willingly boarded your ship, and will remain perfectly unharmed in  the duration of our stay. The Princess is welcome to reacquaint  herself with the pirate Senshi, if nothing else, to assure herself  that they are still on her side. Be prepared for the worst, or you  aren't prepared at all.</p>
<p>“In  case you've forgotten, Setsuna-san can predict the most likely  future, can see into the past, and is very diplomatic concerning  everything. Michiru-san's mirror shows the true nature of the  creature it reflects, and is also capable of being used as a lie  detector, so let's not make any of the important details lies. Ami  is incredibly gifted in the field of academics and medicine, so she  may just be there in case anyone gets hurt. The Princess is  surprisingly intuitive, so much so that you'd best acknowledge all of  your deepest and darkest secrets, because given time, the Princess  will learn of it. Depending on the nature of the secret, she may say  nothing at all, or pry until you wish you weren't tied to her by  duty.”</p>
<p>Another long silence prevailed until  Haruka made a low whistle. “That's some analysis report you have  stockpiled. Just out of curiosity, what would you say about us?”</p>
<p>Rei paused, debating the merits of  answering Haruka's question, before letting out a soft exhale. “I  don't think I know you very well to judge, so I'd rather not say. Is  that all? When the Princess' ship anchors near ours, as I know it  will, I'll board their ship. I shouldn't be gone for more than a day  or two at the most, so...”</p>
<p>“Rei wait.” The fire priestess  paused, her hand on the door knob. Mina cast an uneasy glance at  Makoto and Haruka, bowed her head quickly, and ran after Rei. They  departed together.</p>
<p>Both remained quiet, knowing the topic  on the other's mind, but neither truly wishing to breech it.   Eventually though, Haruka gritted, “You don't want to stay here  with me?”</p>
<p>To which Makoto hastily answered,  “It's not that! Just... the Princess is important to all of us, no  matter how we show it. Mina-chan's right... I was always meant to be  an Inner Senshi... and an Inner Senshi stays close to the Princess to  protect her.”</p>
<p>“Then what about the other Outers?   They can protect the Princess in our place.”</p>
<p>“It's not the same. Knowing that  she's safe... <em>because</em> of  something one of us did... you have no idea how great it feels.”</p>
<p>“How... how can  you know? We both left before we fully gained our Senshi powers.”</p>
<p>Makoto smiled, a  nostalgic gleam in her eyes. “When I was ten, the Princess  convinced me to go with her to the abandoned house on the hill to  clean it up, and then teach her how to make a meal for her mother.   You'd think she could be taught just as well in the Royal Kitchens,  but of course, she was too embarrassed to be in any position to be  seen by anyone while she practiced. Anyways... we actually did  manage to clean it up pretty well, and she was making a surprising  bit of progress with the recipe I set her up for, but then a  convicted criminal disguised as a beggar came to the door. The  Princess, darling that she is, wouldn't hear of the beggar staying  outside, so she invited him in for some just-set-to-cool chocolate  chip cookies.</p>
<p>“I think it took  him about five cookies worth before he finally realized who we were.   Apparently, courage thrives on panic, even if it's flawed. He turned  the table over and in the commotion caught up the Princess and held a  knife to her neck. He demanded a hefty ransom or else he'd kill her.   Being only ten, you can guess that the both of us were pretty scared  at that point. Then... I don't know what came over me, but I calmly  called his bluff to harm the Princess with a rubber knife, and then  while he was distracted, I flung him away from her, making sure he  was unconscious before I tied him up with rope and prepared to call  the authorities to him.</p>
<p>“After  everything was over, the Princess made sure I was listening, and then  thanked me. It was such a heartfelt thanks the reached from her  smile to her eyes, that... I don't think I could have ever been  happier.”</p>
<p>“So that's it  then? You want to be happy? Being a pirate doesn't make you happy?”   Haruka was struggling to isolate the root of the problem.</p>
<p>Makoto only shook  her head. “It's a different sort of happy. Pirating... it's  happiness from acceptance and independence. For the Princess... it's  happiness from protecting her and knowing you're making a  difference.”</p>
<p>Another long  silence followed, ending with Haruka's growl as she stood. “If  we're expecting company, I might as well tell the boys to clean  themselves up a little. I think she'd appreciate a cleaner ship too,  but we've done so much the past few days... it's no big deal. Meet  you at the mess hall?”</p>
<p>Makoto smiled,  knowing that Haruka was slowly accepting her decision, whatever it  was. “Yeah.” Standing, she added, “If the Princess is coming,  and her appetite's about the same as before, I'll warn the cooks to  make a lot more.”</p>
<p>The soft music of  laughter surrounded the duo as they exited the room.</p>
<p>“Princess, are  you sure this is what you want to do?”</p>
<p>Usagi twirled  around and gave her closest adviser a gentle smile. “Of course it  is, Setsuna-san. They deserve to know; <em>we</em> deserve to know the  truth.”</p>
<p>“How much more  truth is there to learn?” Michiru wondered aloud, contempt almost  visible. “Can't you feel their energy signals, Princess? They've  congregated with pirates. They've turned their back on the Kingdom.”</p>
<p>For the fourteen  time in the last half hour, Usagi sighed and protested, “We don't  know their intentions as of yet, Michiru-san. We can't afford to  jump to conclusions.”</p>
<p>Ami stepped  forward to show her support for Usagi's judgment, or lack thereof.   “The Princess is right. Minako-chan, and Rei-chan, they're both  loyal to the Kingdom, and they always have been. They are sure to  have a perfectly good reason for this.”</p>
<p>At the reminder,  Usagi's smile softened to a different meaning. “If Rei-chan agreed  to this whole thing, there is sure to be a good reason, since she  wouldn't do anything without one.”</p>
<p>Setsuna frowned  slightly, remembering the vision she had seen. “Be that as it may,  we must approach with caution.”</p>
<p>Usagi grinned as a  small child only would. “Now, Setsuna-san, when have <em>I</em> ever  failed to approach a subject without due caution?”</p>
<p>Her followers  silently groaned with the coming tide.</p>
