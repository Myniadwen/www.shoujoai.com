<h1>Sailor Moon V: The Dark Adventures of the Sailor Scouts (part 4 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/tstanton.html">Troy "Silver" Stanton</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/smoonv-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>(Author&#39;s Note: This episode occurs sixteen hours after the end of the 
original story entitled &quot;Of Love And Crystal&quot;.) 

The cadet looked up at his terminal as a routine diagnostic check 
tripped a warning flag. &quot;Now what?&quot; he muttered to himself as he typed 
out a query as to the nature of the flag. The crystal computer hummed 
to itself for several seconds before it displayed an answer. The 
cadet&#39;s eyebrows rose as he read the answer. 

He quickly looked around and spotted the duty officer. &quot;Lieutenant?&quot; 
he called out. &quot;Could you take a look at this please?&quot; 

The Dragoon lieutenant walked over and grabbed a nearby chair. &quot;What 
do you need, Cadet?&quot; he said in a friendly tone as he sat down. 

The cadet gestured to the terminal. &quot;Just this, sir. According to the 
data logger, an abnormally large routine time-date check stamp package 
was sent to this location,&quot; he said, tapping at a highlighted set of 
symbols. &quot;The only thing is, this terminal doesn&#39;t exist on the 
network. It was never detected before because all of the previous 
packages were normally sized and flagged for bulk transmit.&quot; 

The lieutenant ran a hand through his spiky purple hair and took a 
closer look at the network address. He smiled as he recognized the 
mystery computer. &quot;Technically it&#39;s not supposed to exist but it does. 
See this symbol? What it means is it&#39;s using a dimensional phase link. 
This computer is the one General Nephlyte used while he was doing his 
work on Earth. I thought it was shut down but apparently he left it 
on.&quot; 

The cadet blinked. &quot;Strange.... I thought a computer wouldn&#39;t request 
anything more than an occasional network check unless someone told it 
to.&quot; 

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; the lieutenant said. 

&quot;Well, sir, according to the logger, the package transmitted 
originated from the central Dragoon archive computer and was 1792 bits 
large. A routine check stamp package is only 256 bits. The host log 
shows that the additional bits were all requested information.&quot; 

&quot;The package came from the archives? Now that&#39;s odd.... Scoot over and 
let me work at this,&quot; the lieutenant said. The cadet quickly made room 
for his superior and sat back to watch. 

The lieutenant tried to access a copy of the package and was surprised 
by the number of security flags he had to circumvent. This is getting 
stranger by the minute, he thought to himself. He worked at it some 
more and finally was able to read the data in the package. The results 
made him sit back in shock. 

A search worm disguised as a time-date check? He put all of his 
computer skills to use as he carefully dissected the search worm to 
read the coding. Wait a second, he thought in surprise, this looks 
familiar.... Yes, a four-step trinary conversion to base-256.... 
Standard anti-detection measures.... Wait. Programmed with Aerce-level 
clearance? 

The lieutenant quickly sat up and did some quick thinking. Only 
command level Dragoons are given Aerce clearance to the central 
archives, he reasoned. I&#39;ve got a level 6 access but that&#39;s only 
because Shar-Tei never got around to fixing the rating Tolaris gave me 
when he was around. Shar-Tei has a level 7 because she&#39;s the 
commander.... level 7..... 

He quickly ran through the code, looking for the encrypted data that 
was the level access. He ran it through a simple descrambler, hoping 
that the data would unscramble so the access rating would be revealed. 
The crystal computer worked at the task for a few minutes before it 
finally came back with the answer. 

The lieutenant knew that only the commanding officer of the Dragoons 
and the current Commander-General had an access rating of level 
seven-Aerce to the Dragoon central archive computer. And there are 
only two people in existence that also know the proper protocols, he 
thought, those being General Rune and Lieutenant Commander Shar-Tei. 
However.... 

He stood up and smiled at the cadet. &quot;According to this, the computer 
had an error message when it ran a checksum diagnostic on a few key 
programs. The extra data in the package is a list of checksums for the 
diagnostic program to use as a template to correct the errors. Nothing 
to worry about.&quot; 

The cadet breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;Good. Sorry to have bothered 
you, Lieutenant.&quot; 

The lieutenant stood up with a smile on his face. &quot;It&#39;s not a problem, 
Cadet. Dealing with this kind of stuff is why I&#39;m here instead of 
sitting on my butt at a desk going through reports. But noticing the 
discrepancy was fine work, Cadet. Keep it up and we&#39;ll have you in the 
Dragoon ranks in no time.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; the cadet said and went back to his mundane tasks. 

The lieutenant walked back to his desk still smiling. But beneath the 
smiling mask he wore, he was shivering inside as a cold hand gripped 
his soul. Is it possible? he thought as he sat down. Could he still be 
alive? 

Lieutenant Maze leaned back in his chair, deeply troubled. He spent 
the next several hours at his desk. barely moving or acknowledging the 
outside world. Inside, a name played over and over in his mind, the 
name of the third person who could have programmed the search worm 
with level seven-Aerce access and who might just possibly still exist. 

Commander Tolaris.... 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Tolaris awoke to the smell of something cooking. He blinked his eyes 
and tried to summon enough mental concentration to identify the smell. 
It&#39;s not something burning so that&#39;s good news, he thought fuzzily as 
he did his best to wake up. Mornings were not his thing and it often 
took him awhile for his mind to completely wake up. 

He blinked in surprise as he recognized the smell of fresh tl&#39;azza 
being cooked. Oh, I bet I haven&#39;t eaten that in months.... he thought 
before he remembered something. Hold it. Who&#39;s cooking it? 

The thought of a stranger in the cathedral instantly completed the 
waking up process. He had hurriedly dressed and was halfway to the 
door before he remembered that he had a guest. Oh, of course. Leda. 

Tolaris smiled as he also remembered that Leda loved to cook. I&#39;m 
willing to bet that tl&#39;azza steak that it&#39;s her in the kitchen. His 
smile fell from his lips as he realized that she might not know how to 
properly cook the food. Granted the tl&#39;azza was harmless, but a few 
Negaverse dishes were extremely dangerous if not prepared right. And 
knowing Nephlyte&#39;s tastes, I&#39;m willing to bet he&#39;s got a few of those 
things around, he thought as he made haste towards the kitchen area. 

Leda looked up from her work as Tolaris entered the kitchen. &quot;Morning, 
Commander. Hope you didn&#39;t mind if I borrowed the kitchen for awhile. 
I got hungry and figured you would want some breakfast, too.&quot; 

Tolaris sniffed the air. &quot;That tl&#39;azza steak smells wonderful, but 
what else were you cooking?&quot; 

Leda shrugged and passed him a plate. &quot;Just some bizarre sort of eggs 
I found in the &#39;fridge.&quot; 

The Dragoon looked down at the plate and gasped. The eggs were dark 
blue with cherry-red yolks. &quot;Ertu eggs? Leda, what did you cook these 
in?&quot; he said with a note of concern. 

&quot;Just this,&quot; she said, holding up a metal skillet. 

Tolaris alternated glances between the eggs and the skillet. He 
mentally revised his opinion of Leda&#39;s cooking skills by several 
notches as he carefully set the plate down on the counter. &quot;Leda, did 
you use the neutralizer?&quot; 

Leda blinked. &quot;Neutralizer?&quot; she said in a confused tone. 

Tolaris sighed and looked around the kitchen. &quot;Do you see a stone 
skillet anywhere around here?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, I saw it as I was digging around for the skillet.... Give me a 
few seconds,&quot; she said as she bent down and went through a cabinet. 
She stood up a few seconds later holding a giant skillet made out of 
synthetic concrete. She handed it to Tolaris and gave him a curious 
look. &quot;What&#39;s this used for?&quot; 

&quot;Cooking ertu eggs,&quot; he said as he carefully slid the eggs off the 
plate and into the skillet. He breathed a sigh of relief as the yolks 
made the move intact. &quot;Keep in mind that the Negaverse is not a 
pleasant place and various creatures have developed defenses against 
being hunted and eaten. If you want to eat an ertu egg, you have to 
soak the entire egg in a special solution to neutralize the enzymes in 
the yolks.&quot; 

Leda blinked and took a closer look at the blue eggs. &quot;What happens if 
the egg isn&#39;t soaked first?&quot; 

&quot;This,&quot; Tolaris said as he picked up a fork and stuck it into the 
yolk. The yolk easily popped and a loud hissing noise filled the room. 
Tolaris made a face as he withdrew the fork and watched as the tines 
started to dissolve. &quot;The enzymes are extremely acidic,&quot; he said 
simply. He waited until the fork had stopped dissolving before he 
threw the useless metal into a trash can. &quot;I think you can consider 
yourself extremely lucky that you didn&#39;t manage to break the yolks as 
you were cooking them.&quot; 

Leda took a long look at the eggs and paled. &quot;I almost scrambled 
them,&quot; she said softly, &quot;But I thought the colors would clash too 
much.... Great Zeus, that&#39;s.... that&#39;s....&quot; She swallowed hard and 
looked up at Tolaris. &quot;Is there anything else I should know about?&quot; 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;Depends on what you want to cook.&quot; He walked over 
to the refrigerator and opened it. &quot;Oh, good, he did have some already 
soaked.&quot; He reached inside and pulled out a translucent box with four 
ertu eggs floating in a pinkish fluid. 

&quot;Here,&quot; he said as he handed the box to Leda. &quot;These eggs are done so 
you can cook them in the metal skillet. Just leave the other eggs in 
the stone pan and pour the neutralizer over them. I&#39;ll dispose of them 
later.&quot; 

&quot;Okay....&quot; Leda said slowly as she got the eggs out of the box. &quot;While 
you&#39;re here and I&#39;m recooking these, how do you want your eggs?&quot; 

The Dragoon chuckled. &quot;Actually, I prefer them scrambled. I know it 
can look quite bizarre at times, but color doesn&#39;t mean much as long 
as it tastes good. Make two for me and two for you. You might like the 
taste.&quot; 

She managed a weak grin. &quot;I&#39;m not sure I can eat anything that eats 
metal like that. Do you want anything else with your steak and eggs, 
assuming that it&#39;s steak to begin with?&quot; 

Tolaris smiled. &quot;I&#39;ll get what I need since you wouldn&#39;t recognize 
half of it.&quot; He stood up and hunted around the kitchen, making sure to 
stay out of Leda&#39;s way. &quot;I didn&#39;t know Nephlyte cared for the taste of 
v&#39;etu,&quot; he said as he picked up something that looked like spongecake. 

&quot;Did you just sneeze?&quot; Leda asked. 

&quot;No. V&#39;etu is our version of wheat bread, except that they use the 
entire stalk instead of just the grains.&quot; 

&quot;Is it good?&quot; she said, curious. 

Tolaris broke a chunk of the bread off and handed it to her. &quot;Try some 
for yourself and see,&quot; he said, breaking off another chunk and eating 
it. 

Leda sniffed the bread cautiously before taking a bite out of it. She 
chewed for a few seconds before making a sour face and swallowing. She 
moved past Tolaris and opened the refrigerator, looking for something 
to drink. 

&quot;Not good, eh?&quot; Tolaris said. 

&quot;No offense, Commander, but it tastes like shredded cardboard. Will 
this hurt me if I drink it?&quot; she asked, holding up a slender bottle 
filled with a ruby-red liquid. 

Tolaris peered closely at the hand-written label and his eyebrows 
rose. &quot;No, it won&#39;t harm you....&quot; 

She didn&#39;t wait for him to finish before popping the cork and taking a 
large gulp. Her eyes went wide as the odd fire sensation started to 
register after she swallowed. She gasped and gave Tolaris a stunned 
look. 

&quot;....But I wouldn&#39;t drink a lot of it at once,&quot; he finished lamely. 
&quot;Too much at once ruins the taste, or so I&#39;ve been told.&quot; He leaned 
against the kitchen counter and waited to see her reactions. 

She blinked and ran her tongue over her lips, not entirely sure about 
the aftertaste. She hesitantly took a smaller sip of the liquid and 
smiled as it went down a lot smoother than before. She finally decided 
she liked the taste and reached for a large cup. &quot;So what is this 
stuff? It&#39;s pretty good.&quot; 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;The closest translation is blood-wine.&quot; He saw the 
color drain out of Leda&#39;s face and he smiled. &quot;The name comes from 
it&#39;s color, not it&#39;s contents.&quot; 

Leda breathed a heavy sigh of relief and looked at the bottle. &quot;So 
this stuff is alcoholic?&quot; she said as she traced her fingers over the 
characters on the label. 

&quot;Very much. Nephlyte used to drink that stuff all the time. We have 
our suspicions that one of his talents was an immunity to alcohol 
because he could easily drink anyone under the table and still be 
stone-cold sober. Of course, more than a few officers believed that 
was a curse and not a talent, but that&#39;s just speculation.&quot; 

&quot;Mmmm,&quot; she said with a smile. &quot;Well, seeing how Nephlyte is no longer 
around to drink it, I think I can give it a nice home in my 
refrigerator.&quot; She poured a generous amount of the blood-wine into the 
cup and stuck the bottle back in the &#39;fridge. &quot;In the meantime....&quot; 

Tolaris took the cup out of her hands. &quot;In the meantime, we can start 
to work on our strategy for tomorrow. I don&#39;t quite know how alcohol 
works on humans, but I&#39;m willing to bet that if you get drunk now 
you&#39;ll be useless to us in the morning. You can drink all you want 
after we get back.&quot; 

Leda sighed and turned back to her work. &quot;Do you have anything else to 
drink then? Some sort of fruit juice?&quot; 

Tolaris nodded. &quot;We have some oratu milk. An oratu is sort of like one 
of your cows, except it&#39;s got armored plates and a bad attitude.&quot; 

&quot;Wonderful,&quot; she said as she spooned the scrambled ertu eggs onto a 
pair of plates. She made sure the tl&#39;azza steaks were thoroughly 
cooked before she set them on the plates and brought them to the small 
kitchen table. &quot;Well, breakfast is ready.&quot; 

Tolaris set the pitcher of oratu milk on the table before sitting 
down. &quot;Thank you, Leda. It looks wonderful.&quot; 

&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said, sitting down. She picked up her silverware and 
began to cut the steak into small chunks. She glanced over to the 
scrambled eggs and burst into a fit of giggles. 

Tolaris looked up at her with a curious expression. &quot;What is it?&quot; 

&quot;Just the eggs,&quot; she said, still giggling. Instead of mixing together, 
the &#39;whites&#39; and yolk retained their separate colors and were now a 
mass of red and blue swirls. &quot;It just looks like I put a Smurf through 
a blender,&quot; she said before she took a bite. &quot;Hey, this is pretty 
good.&quot; 

He gave her a blank look. &quot;What&#39;s a Smurf?&quot; he asked. 

She smiled. &quot;Nevermind,&quot; she said and started to eat her steak. &quot;Get 
Ami to tell you of those nights where you two are in a relaxed cuddle 
mood.&quot; 

&quot;Right....&quot; Tolaris said slowly and turned his attention back to the 
meal. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Tolaris looked up from his computer as Ami and Mina entered the room. 
Ami was carrying a small over-night bag while Mina was wearing a 
backpack and had Artemis in her arms. &quot;Morning, Commander,&quot; the blonde 
said as they approached. 

&quot;Morning, everyone,&quot; he replied as he stood up. &quot;You two look like 
you&#39;re about ready.&quot; 

Ami nodded. &quot;We are, at least for today. Rei won&#39;t be here for another 
hour because she&#39;s still working at the temple, and Luna is still 
trying to get Serena out of bed.&quot; 

&quot;That must be fun,&quot; the Dragoon commented as he looked at Artemis. 
&quot;While we&#39;re loosely on the subject of cats, you must be Artemis.&quot; 

The cat nodded. &quot;Nice to finally meet you, Commander Sterling.&quot; 

Tolaris sighed softly and sat back down. &quot;The Sterling part is a bunch 
of cow so you can drop it. Denizens don&#39;t have last names, so it&#39;s 
just Tolaris.&quot; 

Mina giggled. &quot;I think you mean it&#39;s a bunch of bull.&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s the difference?&quot; 

&quot;A bull is a male cow.&quot; 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;I thought that was a steer.&quot; 

&quot;Only for cattle,&quot; Mina said with a smile. 

&quot;One minor technicality,&quot; the Dragoon grumbled. &quot;Oh, well. Thanks for 
the correction, Mina. We&#39;ll make a Dragoon out of you yet.&quot; 

The blonde&#39;s smile became wider. &quot;I&#39;ll stick with being a Sailor 
Scout, thanks.&quot; 

&quot;So when do we start the briefing?&quot; Ami asked. 

&quot;Just as soon as everyone is here,&quot; he replied. &quot;I want to have 
everyone together first so we can go over it as a group. In the 
meantime, you two are invited to use the training facilities in the 
sub-levels.&quot; 

Something exploded somewhere in the depths of the cathedral-base and 
the floor shook gently. Tolaris sighed and gestured to the floor. &quot;And 
it sounds like Miss Jupiter has figured out how to work the target 
launcher. Come on, we&#39;d better go before she discovers the fun stuff,&quot; 
he said as he stood up and left the room in a slight haste. 

&quot;Fun stuff?&quot; Mina echoed as she and the others followed the Dragoon 
down the hallway. 

&quot;Plasma grenades, live-fire practice targets, simulated environments, 
that sort of thing. Very nasty unless you know what you&#39;re dealing 
with.&quot; 

&quot;And that&#39;s your idea of fun?&quot; Ami asked, slightly stunned. 

&quot;I can see why the ammunition stuff would be dangerous,&quot; said the cat, 
still in Mina&#39;s arms, &quot;But why would a simulated environment be bad?&quot; 

Tolaris gave him an amused look as he opened the door to a stairwell. 
&quot;Tell me, Artemis, would you find it pleasant to fight a battle in the 
middle of a jungle where only three of the eighty-five creatures in 
there aren&#39;t poisonous?&quot; 

&quot;I.... can imagine that wouldn&#39;t be fun,&quot; was the awed response. 

&quot;Trust me, it isn&#39;t,&quot; Tolaris said as he went down the stairs. He 
grabbed onto the handrail as another explosion rocked the building. 
&quot;At least it feels like she&#39;s not using the multiple-target mode.&quot; 

&quot;Commander, what exactly is she doing, anyway?&quot; Mina asked with a 
frown. 

&quot;It sounds like she&#39;s taking potshots at self-propelled target drones. 
They tend to explode if hit too hard. She&#39;s probably using a launcher 
to toss them into random places and have the drones start wandering 
around. Nothing too complex, but those drones can be rather 
maneuverable at times.&quot; 

The stairs ended at a pair of heavy steel bulkheads. Tolaris walked up 
to the control panel and was about to open them when they heard a 
series of loud pops, followed by another large explosion. The Dragoon 
leaned against the wall and sighed heavily. 

&quot;Oh, no....&quot; he moaned quietly. 

Ami blinked. &quot;What is it?&quot; 

&quot;I think she found the MechBlaster 3000.&quot; 

Mina shook her head. &quot;The what?&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s sort of like a super-heavy assault rifle, only much worse. 
Everyone stand back, please.&quot; He waited until everyone had flattened 
themselves against the walls before he opened the bulkheads. 

Something hissed as the plates retracted into the ceiling and floor. A 
large cloud of smoke wafted out into the hall, obscuring vision and 
making Ami cough. Tolaris sent a strong breeze across the room, 
dispersing the smoke in seconds. &quot;Don&#39;t shoot, it&#39;s only me!&quot; he 
called out before cautiously peering around the edge of the archway. 

Sailor Jupiter was standing in the middle of the room, surrounded by 
the remains of several target drones. She had an ear-to-ear grin on 
her face and was holding a large weapon that was literally almost as 
big as she was. 

&quot;Commander, I think I&#39;ve fallen in love. This thing is WICKED!&quot; she 
said with a smile as she gingerly set the weapon on the ground. 
&quot;Heavy, too, but I think it&#39;s worth it. Mind if I use it while we&#39;re 
in the Negaverse?&quot; 

Tolaris sighed again and stepped into the room. &quot;No, you can&#39;t. If you 
take that thing into the Negaverse, the tracer beacon will alert 
everyone for a radius of ten miles to its presence. It&#39;s a prototype 
and I think that quite a few people would be interested in acquiring 
it.&quot; 

Jupiter shrugged and walked over to them. &quot;Hi, everyone,&quot; she said to 
the two Sailor Scouts and Artemis. &quot;You two want to come play with the 
drones?&quot; she said, making a gesture to the bulky launcher in the far 
corner of the room. 

&quot;Perhaps, but not with tank ordinance,&quot; Mina said with a slight smile. 
&quot;Tolaris said it&#39;d be a good idea for us to practice a bit while we&#39;re 
waiting for everyone else to arrive.&quot; 

Jupiter nodded. &quot;Knowing Serena, it&#39;ll be quite some time before we 
see her. Which is okay, I guess, since we get to play with the drones 
some more.&quot; 

Artemis chuckled. &quot;You seem to have a thing for drones, Jupiter.&quot; 

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t call it play,&quot; Tolaris said as he walked over and picked 
up the heavy assault weapon. &quot;Those drones can be set to fire back at 
you using live ammunition. Not to mention randomly tossing out small 
plasma grenades or anti-personnel mines.&quot; 

&quot;And this is supposed to be a combat simulator?&quot; Ami asked. 

&quot;Nothing like having your butt on the line as incentive for survival,&quot; 
the Dragoon commented as he walked over to a control panel. He looked 
at the tiny display and frowned. &quot;Jupiter, where did you get the 
MechBlaster from?&quot; 

&quot;It was just leaning against the wall. Why?&quot; 

&quot;It was supposed to have been in the armory, which is locked tight.&quot; 

Sailor Jupiter&#39;s eyes lit up like candles. &quot;You mean you have more 
stuff like that?&quot; she said, drooling ever so slightly. 

Tolaris exchanged glances with Ami and Mina. &quot;Is she usually like this 
around weapons?&quot; 

&quot;We don&#39;t know. We&#39;ve never really been around military-class weapons 
before,&quot; Ami said with a shrug. &quot;Best we&#39;ve got is Mina&#39;s dagger and 
Rei&#39;s ceremonial blade.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ve got a bad feeling about this,&quot; muttered Artemis as he leapt out 
of Mina&#39;s arms and down to the ground. 

Tolaris sighed and turned his attention back to the control panel. He 
entered a complex string of characters into the keypad and a light 
flashed dark green. There was the sound of heavy bolts unlocking and 
the bulkheads started to retract into the ceiling and floor. &quot;This 
might take awhile,&quot; he said and leaned against a wall to wait. 

&quot;Now that is a very big door,&quot; Mina said as she saw the thickness of 
the bulkheads. &quot;Tell me, Commander, do you have very many problems 
with people getting into these things?&quot; 

&quot;Not that I know of.&quot; 

&quot;Can&#39;t imagine why,&quot; Ami said with a glance at the bulkheads. 

After a full minute, the two-foot-thick steel plates were done 
retracting into the reinforced walls and the armory was open. Tolaris 
hefted the weapon and walked inside, the rest of the group following 
close behind. 

Jupiter looked around at the vast array of weapons and started 
bouncing on her toes with extreme excitement. &quot;This is way cool,&quot; she 
giggled and started to explore. 

&quot;This is not a good sign,&quot; Ami said with a sigh. 

&quot;You&#39;re telling me,&quot; Artemis said as he looked around. &quot;What is half 
this stuff?&quot; 

Tolaris set the heavy assault weapon down on a specially-built cradle. 
&quot;They&#39;re mostly the various types of projectile-weapons we have 
available in the Negaverse. There are some hand-held weapons, mostly 
swords, on that wall,&quot; he said with a gesture. He looked up and 
Jupiter and sighed. &quot;Put that back, you can&#39;t use it.&quot; 

Jupiter blinked and put the siege crossbow back in it&#39;s cradle. &quot;Is 
there anything in here that I can use?&quot; 

&quot;Have you ever used any of this stuff before?&quot; he asked. 

&quot;Well.... not really....&quot; 

Tolaris smiled. &quot;Tell me, Jupiter, do you really want to go into 
hostile territory carrying an untested weapon that you have no idea 
how to use?&quot; 

Jupiter sighed. &quot;Since you put it that way, I guess not.&quot; 

&quot;Commander, can I take a closer look at this?&quot; Mina called out from 
across the armory. She was pressed against a transparent casing and 
was gazing rather wistfully at a collection of daggers. 

&quot;Hey!&quot; Jupiter said, brightening up again. &quot;Now there&#39;s something I 
know how to use. Mind if we check them out for a bit, Commander?&quot; 

Tolaris looked at Artemis and the cat shrugged. &quot;I&#39;ve seen the way she 
cooks and I know she&#39;s lethal with a kitchen knife. Mina&#39;s no slouch 
either with her blade, though she doesn&#39;t practice often.&quot; 

The Dragoon glanced over at the three girls. Jupiter and Mina were 
both pressed against the casing with admiration and desire in their 
eyes. Ami was standing a bit farther back from the case but she seemed 
to be more than mildly interested in the daggers. 

&quot;Tell me, Artemis, would you trust them with daggers in their 
possession?&quot; 

The cat sat back and preened. &quot;Mina and Jupiter most definitely. I 
think I can also say Rei is a sure bet, given her training with 
ceremonial blades and such. I&#39;m not sure about Serena, though. She is 
rather clumsy at times.&quot; 

&quot;And what about Ami?&quot; Tolaris asked softly. 

Artemis sighed and looked over at the vampire. Ami seemed captivated 
by one of the blades in the collection. She reached out and slowly 
traced it&#39;s outline against the glass, as if she were touching the 
blade itself instead of the casing. The expression in her eyes seemed 
to be one of respect rather than the admiration of her friends. 

&quot;I heard how she killed one of the Negaverse&#39;s warriors,&quot; Artemis said 
in low tones. &quot;Took the Crescent Moon Wand and gutted her like a fish. 
I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be too happy having her armed with a lethal weapon, 
Commander, but I&#39;m not going with you guys into the Negaverse and 
getting into trouble. If you don&#39;t mind the possibility of her going 
berserk on you, then go ahead. It is a command decision, if I 
understand the term correctly.&quot; 

&quot;You seem to understand it well enough,&quot; Tolaris said and quietly 
walked over to the collection of daggers. &quot;Can I trust you three 
enough to use them properly?&quot; he said as he approached. 

&quot;Define properly,&quot; Mina said. 

&quot;These are lethal weapons, not toys. They should only be unsheathed 
when they&#39;re to be used and they are only to be used for combat. Since 
I will be leading this little excursion, we will abide by the Rules of 
Engagement as per Captain Raijen&#39;s original orders three thousand 
years ago. The full list is too complex to explain, but know that you 
are to use an artificial weapon only when you intend to kill and kill 
quickly. Needless suffering is dishonorable and I will not stand for 
it. Understood?&quot; 

The three girls blanched. &quot;So in essence, we&#39;re not supposed to even 
unsheathe the daggers unless we&#39;re going to kill someone, right?&quot; 
Jupiter said. 

&quot;Precisely. If you cannot abide by the Rules of Engagement, then you 
have no business carrying a weapon,&quot; Tolaris said firmly. &quot;And that 
includes the blade you&#39;re carrying, Miss Venus, regardless of it&#39;s 
original purpose.&quot; 

Mina nodded. &quot;I understand, Commander, and will abide by your rules.&quot; 

&quot;Same here, Commander,&quot; Jupiter said, looking up at him. 

&quot;I will follow by the rules as well,&quot; Ami said softly. 

Jupiter blinked and turned around to look at her. &quot;I didn&#39;t think that 
carrying daggers was your style. Ami.&quot; 

Ami shrugged. &quot;Never hurts to be prepared in case of extreme 
emergency. I&#39;ll just keep it in my boot.&quot; 

Jupiter giggled. &quot;At least you have decent boots,&quot; she said, gesturing 
to her own boots. Unlike the boots worn by Sailor Moon and Sailor 
Mercury, her boots only came up a few inches past her ankle. &quot;I don&#39;t 
have much space to put a blade down there.&quot; 

Mina laughed. &quot;At least you two have boots.&quot; 

&quot;And what exactly do you have?&quot; Tolaris asked as he started to unlock 
the protective casing. 

&quot;Modified sandals. They&#39;re tougher than they look.&quot; 

&quot;Except when you&#39;re kicking walls,&quot; Artemis snickered. 

Mina frowned lightly. &quot;Hey, I only hit the wall because that punk 
moved, alright? Otherwise I would have nailed him.&quot; 

&quot;When was this?&quot; Jupiter asked. &quot;I don&#39;t remember ever having to peel 
you off of a wall.&quot; 

Mina shrugged. &quot;It was while I was still operating as Sailor V.&quot; 

Tolaris cussed as he slipped and the lid of the casing slammed down on 
his fingers. &quot;Wait a second. YOU&#39;RE Sailor V? Mina, do you know how 
many people in the Negaverse want your hide?&quot; 

The blonde blinked. &quot;Uh oh.... I take it I developed a reputation?&quot; 

Tolaris snorted. &quot;You dispatched twenty-six operatives, two Dragoons, 
and a member of the Psi-Corp before the appearance of Sailor Moon put 
everything else on hold. You think that&#39;s enough to give you a 
reputation?&quot; 

Mina looked at Artemis. &quot;Told you I missed one.&quot; 

Artemis shrugged. &quot;Okay, so my body count was off by one.&quot; 

The Dragoon looked at Mina with a higher degree of respect. &quot;Remind me 
to never piss you off, Mina.&quot; He opened the lid of the casing and 
stepped back. &quot;Okay, girls, you can choose any dagger you want, but 
only take one. This is a rather valuable collection, and while I&#39;m 
sure Nephlyte would approve of them being used, I wouldn&#39;t want to 
destroy their value any more than I have to.&quot; 

&quot;Afraid of him coming back?&quot; quipped Jupiter and she picked up a 
dagger. 

&quot;Tell me, did anyone recover his body?&quot; Tolaris asked solemnly. 

Everyone looked at Ami and she shook her head. &quot;No, his body broke 
down into luminescent particles. Molly said the monster said that 
those spines in his shoulder would drain his energy and reduce him to 
&#39;Negadust&#39; or something like that.&quot; 

Tolaris frowned. &quot;But no body was left behind, right?&quot; 

Ami shook her head again. &quot;No, just dust.&quot; She reached inside and 
picked up the dagger she had been looking at. The blade was made out 
of an iridescent crystal with tiny glitters of gem dust imbedded along 
the length. The hilt was also made of crystal, but it was a deep 
purple color with silver filigree. The crossguard was forged from a 
silvery metal with an inscription acid-etched into it. 

The blade Mina selected was almost exactly like the one she currently 
carried, with the exception that the blade&#39;s metal was an interesting 
shade of steel blue. The rest of the blade was plain steel, with the 
exception of a tiny, glittering gem embedded in the very center of the 
blade. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind, Commander, I&#39;d like to borrow this one. I 
already know how to use this kind so it&#39;d be easier to handle.&quot; 

Tolaris nodded. &quot;Wise decision. What about you, Jupiter?&quot; 

Sailor Jupiter held up a dagger forged out of black steel. The blade 
was split in half almost down to the hilt, with extremely sharp points 
and razor edges. &quot;I think I&#39;ll use this. If I have to kill something, 
might as well make sure the dagger can handle it.&quot; 

Tolaris blinked. &quot;Umm.... right. That&#39;s mostly used to parry with, but 
I don&#39;t foresee any problems with straight killing. Not that I plan us 
to be killing anything, but just in case. Keep in mind that the edges 
are extremely sharp so be careful when drawing it out of the sheath.&quot; 

&quot;Speaking of which,&quot; said Artemis, &quot;How are you girls going to carry 
those blades? Ami said she could keep it her uniform boots, but what 
about the rest of you?&quot; 

Mina giggled. &quot;What about our Lunar Space pockets?&quot; 

The white cat blinked and managed to blush red. &quot;Oops, guess I 
forgot.&quot; 

&quot;Lunar Space?&quot; Tolaris asked. 

Jupiter nodded. &quot;It&#39;s sort of like a dimensional pocket. It is rather 
small, but it should fit,&quot; she said and held the dagger behind her. 
She made a flicking motion with her wrist and smiled. She brought her 
empty hand back and showed it to Tolaris. 

&quot;It&#39;s small for you because your Space isn&#39;t supposed to hold anything 
other than your Power Wand,&quot; Ami said as she reached behind her and 
pulled her Mercury Wand out of her Lunar Space pocket. &quot;I&#39;ve got more 
space because I need to put my computer there.&quot; 

Mina nodded and also put her dagger in her Lunar Space pocket. Her 
hand came back holding her Venus Wand. &quot;Now that we&#39;re suitably armed, 
why don&#39;t we start practicing with the drones until the others 
arrive?&quot; 

Tolaris nodded. &quot;Good idea, but I have to warn you that if you bring 
out your blade against the drones, that will activate the Live/Kill 
mode.&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; Jupiter said, shaking her head. 

&quot;Part of the Rules of Engagement. If you attack anyone with any sort 
of artificial weapon, it is akin to issuing a death challenge, stating 
your intent to kill. If you do that with the drones, they will switch 
to live-fire mode and do their best to kill you. It didn&#39;t do that 
with the prototype because it was set for test fire only, not active 
combat.&quot; 

&quot;I see....&quot; Mina said slowly. &quot;If it&#39;s all the same with everyone 
else, we&#39;ll skip that part.&quot; Jupiter and Ami nodded violently and 
Tolaris chuckled. 

&quot;Well, ladies, I&#39;ve got other work to attend to so I&#39;ll leave you 
three alone to practice. If you don&#39;t mind, Artemis, I&#39;ll show you how 
to program the drone launcher so you can run them through various 
exercises.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;d like that, Commander,&quot; the cat said with a wicked grin. 

Mina giggled. &quot;Be nice, Artemis. Remember, you have to live with me.&quot; 
She held her Power Wand up to the light and said, &quot;VENUS POWER!&quot; Her 
body was wrapped in a field of light that slowly transformed her into 
Sailor Venus. 

&quot;Good idea,&quot; Ami said and held up her own Wand. &quot;MERCURY POWER!&quot; 

Tolaris leaned against the glass casing and watched as the two girls 
were transformed into the Sailor Scouts. It never ceased to amaze him 
at how they could look so different as Sailor Scouts. Ami told him 
once that the visual effect was part of the magic used to make them 
Sailor Scouts. 

The transformations were finished and Tolaris blinked. &quot;If I didn&#39;t 
just watch you two transform, I&#39;d swear you were different people,&quot; he 
said to Venus and Mercury. 

Mercury set her dagger down on the protective casing and walked over 
to Tolaris. &quot;But you still love me, right?&quot; she said as she embraced 
him. 

&quot;Always,&quot; he whispered in her ear as he kissed her. 

Artemis coughed discreetly. &quot;Want me to wait or should I start poking 
around with the launcher now?&quot; 

The Dragoon chuckled softly and gave Mercury a final kiss. &quot;Okay, 
okay, I&#39;ll show you,&quot; he said and headed off towards the door. Mercury 
reached out and grabbed her dagger. She slid it into her boot and took 
a few experimental steps. Satisfied that she wouldn&#39;t cut herself, she 
hurried after the rest of the Scouts and prepared to take on a few 
practice drones. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The crystalline computer finished processing the newly acquired data 
and displayed the results on the screen. Tolaris sighed heavily and 
rested his head on the edge of the workstation. So much for stealth, 
he thought wryly. 

Someone coughed and the Dragoon quickly looked up. Darian and Luna 
were standing in the doorway with curious expressions on their faces. 
&quot;Paperwork got you down?&quot; Darian joked as he walked into the room. 

&quot;I wish it was that simple. I fear someone&#39;s discovered my presence on 
Earth and now I have to radically alter my plans,&quot; Tolaris said with a 
weary gesture to the computer. &quot;We&#39;ll probably wind up taking a less 
direct route, and that will probably take two or three days 
roundtrip.&quot; 

Luna frowned. &quot;How much more danger will the Scouts be in?&quot; she asked. 

&quot;Probably a lot more, but I can&#39;t say for sure. We won&#39;t really know 
how much until we get in there.&quot; He paused and gave Luna a measured 
look. &quot;It&#39;s not too late for the Sailor Scouts to remain behind and 
let me go alone.&quot; 

&quot;Trust me, I&#39;m still trying to get them to see that,&quot; she said sourly. 

The Dragoon smiled. &quot;Speaking of them, where are Serena and Rei?&quot; 

Darian coughed lightly. &quot;They&#39;re here, but they&#39;re in the middle of 
one of their, uh, discussions....&quot; 

He was about to say more when several small explosions went off and 
the floor shook gently. Rei suddenly burst into the room, her 
bottomless black eyes wide with shock. &quot;I think we&#39;re under attack!&quot; 
she yelled as she looked for something solid to hold on to. 

Tolaris laughed. &quot;Not quite. That&#39;s just the other Sailor Scouts 
playing with target drones.&quot; 

&quot;Who&#39;s playing with what?&quot; Serena asked as she scrambled into the room 
and grabbed hold of Darian. &quot;It feels like we&#39;re in an earthquake.&quot; 

Tolaris stood and smiled. &quot;Come on, I&#39;ll show you.&quot; He led them out 
into the hallway and towards the staircase. &quot;They&#39;re in a training 
room practicing their skills against several target drones, that&#39;s 
all.&quot; The floor shook again and everyone leaned against the wall for 
support. &quot;However, the drones have a slightly annoying tendency to 
explode if hit too hard.&quot; 

&quot;And you said this is practice?&quot; Luna asked. 

The Dragoon shrugged. &quot;At least they&#39;re not programmed to fire back 
yet.&quot; 

Serena blinked. &quot;You mean they can shoot back? Maybe this isn&#39;t a good 
idea after all....&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s not like they can kill you, right?&quot; Rei asked hesitantly. 

&quot;Of course they can. Why else would they be shooting at you?&quot; 

Everyone stopped and exchanged glances. Tolaris turned around and gave 
them an evil grin. &quot;If you are going to go into the Negaverse, it is 
highly probable that you will wind up getting shot at by various 
denizens. You might as well get used to it. I won&#39;t set the drones to 
kill you, just come close enough to rattle you. But that will wait 
until after the briefing and lunch.&quot; 

&quot;When will lunch be?&quot; Serena asked with a hand over her stomach. 
&quot;Someone woke me up and rushed me through breakfast this morning.&quot; 

Rei snorted. &quot;I only did it because Luna was busy getting some before 
she got around to getting OUCH!!&quot; She blinked and looked at the set of 
claw marks on her ankle. &quot;Hey, that had just started to heal!&quot; 

Everyone stared at Luna in silence. The cat calmly sat back and 
started to preen her paws. &quot;Are you finished, Rei?&quot; she asked mildly. 

&quot;Umm.... yeah....&quot; 

&quot;Then let&#39;s go see what the others are up to.&quot; She glanced up and 
sighed. &quot;Serena, you can pick your jaw up now.&quot; 

The blonde blinked. &quot;So that WAS you and Hercules.&quot; 

&quot;Yes it was. Now can we stop discussing my love life and get going?&quot; 

Tolaris chuckled quietly. &quot;We can discuss that later. Right now, I&#39;ve 
got to get the others so we can start this briefing.&quot; He led the group 
down several flights of stairs. They walked in silence, the only sound 
being the occasional explosion from the training room. 

The group halted when the stairs ended at a set of immense bulkheads. 
&quot;Okay, everyone stay close to the walls while I open this, just in 
case their accuracy isn&#39;t the greatest.&quot; Only Darian bothered to 
snicker at the comment as they flattened themselves against the wall. 
Tolaris nodded and pushed the control button. 

The bulkheads had only partially retracted into the ceiling and floor 
when something popped and the sound of a flying drone could be heard. 
&quot;I&#39;ve got this one,&quot; called out a familiar voice. &quot;Mercury Bubbles.... 
BLAST!!&quot; 

Without warning, a sphere of force shot out between the bulkheads, 
pushing the target drone ahead of it like a surfer riding a wave. The 
rogue sphere impacted with a wall, smashing the drone into shards of 
metal and detonating in a miniature fireball. Everyone threw 
themselves onto the floor as the wave of heat and pressure washed over 
them. 

&quot;Are you trying to kill us out here, Mercury?!&quot; Serena yelled as she 
rose to her feet. &quot;If so, you seem to be doing a pretty good job!&quot; 

The bulkheads finished retracting and Mercury stepped out of the room 
with a blush on her cheeks. &quot;Sorry about that, didn&#39;t know it was 
opening.&quot; 

&quot;Nice to see you too, love,&quot; Tolaris said as he gave her a quick kiss. 
&quot;I take it everything is going okay in there?&quot; 

Mercury giggled. &quot;Sure, despite the facts that Artemis is having 
entirely too much fun with the launcher and Jupiter is being rather 
trigger-happy.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s not good. We&#39;ll need to try to stay as quiet as possible on 
this mission. Anyway, you four can take a quick break while I let 
these three pick out their daggers. After that&#39;s all settled, we can 
start our briefing.&quot; 

Mercury nodded. &quot;Good, I think we could use a bit of a rest.&quot; She 
turned around and yelled back into the room. &quot;Artemis, turn off the 
launcher for a few minutes. Everyone else is here and we&#39;re going to 
start the briefing in a bit.&quot; She turned back and noticed Rei was 
giving her a strange look. &quot;What is it, Rei?&quot; 

The priestess shrugged. &quot;Nothing, really. It just felt as if your aura 
wavered for a second.&quot; 

There was another loud pop and a second drone could be heard flying 
about. &quot;I&#39;ll get it!&quot; said another familiar voice. &quot;Jupiter 
Thunder.... CRASH!!&quot; The room was lit up as a bolt of lightning was 
sent through the hapless drone. It fell to the ground, it&#39;s protective 
casing badly cracked and charred. 

&quot;Hey, you want to quit with the drones, Artemis?&quot; came the voice of 
Sailor Venus. &quot;The door&#39;s open and they&#39;re all waiting for us.&quot; 

&quot;Aww, do we have to?&quot; said Sailor Jupiter. &quot;This was getting fun....&quot; 

Luna sighed. &quot;I think I need to have a bit of a talk with her.&quot; 

Darian nodded. &quot;No kidding. Tolaris, what was that about daggers?&quot; 

&quot;Follow me and I&#39;ll explain as we go,&quot; the Dragoon said as he stepped 
into the training room. He hadn&#39;t taken six steps before he stepped on 
the remains of a drone. He blinked and looked around at the carnage. 
&quot;By Raijen, how many drones did you go through?&quot; 

Sailor Venus stretched and smiled. &quot;I lost count around three 
hundred.&quot; 

Tolaris just sighed as he carefully walked toward the armory doors. 
&quot;And they wondered why you five did so much damage the last time....&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The crystal bounced twice before it came to rest in the center of the 
vast table. It immediately executed its primary program and projected 
a holographic map into the air. The image was three-dimensional and 
slowly rotated to give all of the viewers the best possible angle. 

&quot;This is a simplistic overhead map of our intended route,&quot; Tolaris&#39;s 
voice came from the corner of the darkened room. The only light came 
from the image being projected from the tiny crystal. 

&quot;My original plan was to open the wormhole at this point,&quot; he said and 
a blue dot lit up on the map. &quot;However, I fear that we may have been 
discovered. Therefore, we will arrive at this point.&quot; A red light lit 
up, quite a distance away from the blue dot. 

&quot;Due to the wards surrounding the Dragoon complex, we can only open 
the wormholes at specific points. This point is far enough away from 
the complex to avoid routine patrols yet close enough to be able to 
arrive within a day.&quot; 

A series of yellow dots appeared on the map, tracing out a route from 
the red dot to the glowing green diagram of the Dragoon Headquarters. 
Several white rings appeared at various points across the map, not 
seeming to follow any given pattern. 

&quot;We will follow along this path to the complex. As you can see, the 
white rings are the projected locations of routine patrols. They may 
be out of date or a patrol might be on special assignment, so we can&#39;t 
really trust this. It does, however, give us a good starting point to 
plan for where possible points of conflict might occur. 

&quot;Once we reach the complex, we will attempt to enter through this 
storage bay.&quot; The map switched to a detailed floor plan of the 
complex. A large room lit up a bright shade of green and a series of 
yellow dots traced a path deeper inside the complex. &quot;We are fortunate 
that most of what we need is located in that storage bay. However, 
there are a few items I need to get from a secured storage room deeper 
within the complex.&quot; 

The map rotated to a side-view of the complex. The main storage bay 
was shown in green on the first level while another room was shown in 
flashing red three levels down below the surface. 

&quot;Here we split up. Sailors Mars and Jupiter will remain behind in the 
bay to cover our rears while the rest of us proceed to the second 
target. The target, however, is considerably protected against 
intrusion so it will take several minutes for me to bypass the 
security network. This is when we&#39;ll be the most vunerable to attack, 
so I want Sailors Venus, Moon, and Tuxedo Mask to spread out in a 
defensive perimeter while Sailor Mercury scans for any signs of 
hostile activity. 

&quot;After the cargo has been acquired, we&#39;ll backtrack to pick up the 
others and the rest of the cargo. I&#39;m almost absolutely certain that 
removing the cargo from the complex will activate an alarm, so we will 
really have to watch our backs. However, if all goes well, we won&#39;t be 
noticed until that time.&quot; 

The map switched back to the overhead view of the entrance point and 
the surrounding terrain. &quot;We have a margin of safety up until a 
certain point. If we encounter any problems before we reach the 
complex, we can abort and return back here with little trouble. 
However, once we breach the complex and acquire the cargo, we could 
very well be up against the entire Dragoon division.&quot; 

The crystal shut off and the room fell into darkness before Tolaris 
hit a light switch. The room was illuminated softly and everyone 
looked around the table. &quot;If anyone has questions, now is the time for 
it,&quot; the Dragoon said and sat down in a chair. 

&quot;What exactly is this cargo we&#39;re going to get?&quot; Mina asked. 

&quot;Mostly personal effects, but those I can live without. The second 
target contains all of the information I&#39;ve gathered over my seven 
centuries of life as well as a few unique crystals. The data might be 
able to be reconstructed, given enough time, but those crystals simply 
cannot be replaced.&quot; 

&quot;What exactly are those crystals?&quot; Darian asked with a slight frown. 

Tolaris sighed and slumped in his chair. &quot;The remains of my parents, 
as well as of a few powerful Dragoons. Rumor has it one of them is 
Raijen&#39;s life crystal, but it is impossible to prove. Also, I believe 
that the Star Crystal General Nephlyte created is there, and I owe it 
to him to retrieve it.&quot; 

&quot;Who&#39;s Raijen?&quot; Ami asked. 

Tolaris smiled. &quot;Ah, yes. Captain Raijen. He founded the Dragoons over 
five thousand years ago, back when Queen Beryl&#39;s grandmother was the 
Queen of the Negaverse. After his death, the ranking Commander refused 
the customary promotion to Captain, saying that such an honor could 
only be filled by Raijen alone and since Raijen never named his 
successor, he would retain his rank. Since then, no Dragoon has ever 
accepted the rank of Captain, quoting Commander Aerce&#39;s words as 
justification.&quot; 

&quot;So you&#39;re going to retrieve their remains out of respect, then,&quot; said 
Rei softly. &quot;I can accept that and will gladly accompany you.&quot; 

&quot;Speaking of which,&quot; said Luna as she leapt up onto the table. &quot;I want 
to make sure each and every one of you realizes the danger in this 
mission, and I want to know your reasons for going with Commander 
Sterling, despite his pleas not to.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m going because I love him and I would go absolutely nuts if I had 
no idea what happened to him if he doesn&#39;t come back,&quot; Ami said, 
looking down at the table. &quot;If I&#39;m with him, I know what&#39;s going on 
and I can help him.&quot; 

Leda sat back and smiled. &quot;And I&#39;m going with her for tactical 
support. Can&#39;t let you two have all of the fun, and besides, I&#39;ve got 
nothing better to do until this snowstorm lets up.&quot; 

&quot;It figures you would say something like that,&quot; Luna said with a very 
loud sigh. &quot;What about you, Mina?&quot; 

The blonde smiled. &quot;I&#39;m coming along because I&#39;m curious as to what 
the Negaverse is really like. That, and someone&#39;s got to keep these 
two out of trouble.&quot; 

Rei snickered. &quot;I thought that&#39;s why I was coming along. Anyway, we 
are a team and we should go together as a team.&quot; 

Luna sighed again, feeling rather old for her age. She muttered 
something inaudible about bad dreams and turned to Serena. She opened 
her mouth to ask her a question but stopped when she saw what she was 
doing. 

Serena was holding the Crescent Moon Wand in her hands and was gazing 
at the Imperium Silver Crystal as if she had never seen it before. 
Luna thought it might have been a trick of the light, but she could 
have sworn she saw the gleam of the Crystal reflected in Serena&#39;s eyes 
for a brief instant. 

&quot;Luna,&quot; she said somewhat distantly, &quot;For some reason, I think that I 
have to go on this one. Don&#39;t ask me why because I can&#39;t explain it. I 
just feel that I need to go.&quot; 

Everyone looked at her. &quot;Serena, are you alright?&quot; Luna asked with 
some concern. 

Serena smiled softly at her mentor and put the Crescent Moon Wand back 
in her Lunar Space pocket. &quot;I&#39;m fine, Luna. It just feels like I need 
to go, that&#39;s all.&quot; 

The cat sighed and laid down. &quot;I don&#39;t suppose I could convince you to 
help keep them here, could I, Darian?&quot; 

Darian laughed quietly. &quot;Nope, since I&#39;m going with them.&quot; 

Luna looked ready to cry. &quot;I figured as much. Very well, then, since 
you girls seem so determined to go on this, Artemis and I have no 
choice but to do our best to help you.&quot; 

Tolaris frowned. &quot;If you intend to come with us, I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t 
allow that. If you can&#39;t fight, you&#39;d be a hindrance to us.&quot; 

Luna shook her head. &quot;No, no, I&#39;m staying here. However, Artemis and I 
have collected a surprisingly large reserve of Lunar energy while 
we&#39;ve been on Earth and I think it&#39;s time we put that energy to good 
use.&quot; 

Artemis nodded and leapt out of Mina&#39;s lap. He landed in the middle of 
the table and walked over next to Luna. &quot;I&#39;m ready when you are,&quot; he 
said. 

&quot;Good. Now pay attention, Sailor Scouts. What we can do is either give 
you entirely new, stronger powers, or supercharge your current powers 
to a new level of power. Either way, the change will be irreversible 
and we won&#39;t be able to do such a thing again for a very long time.&quot; 

&quot;What will happen to our old powers if we get the new ones?&quot; Rei 
asked. 

Luna sighed. &quot;I&#39;m afraid the new powers would wipe out your old ones. 
I don&#39;t know the exact mechanics of it, but I understand that your 
Scout essences can only hold so much in the way of power templates.&quot; 

&quot;So if we went with the new powers, we would have to relearn how to 
use them correctly, right?&quot; said Leda. &quot;Thanks, but no thanks. It&#39;s 
like Tolaris told me, I don&#39;t want to be going into hostile territory 
carrying an untested power that I don&#39;t know how to use. I&#39;ll stick 
with what I know for now.&quot; 

Artemis snickered. &quot;She has a point, Luna. They don&#39;t have the time to 
relearn how to be Sailor Scouts.&quot; 

&quot;True. Very well. Do the four of you agree that your powers should be 
supercharged, then?&quot; asked Luna. 

The four Sailor Scouts nodded their heads while Serena frowned. 
&quot;Excuse me, but what about my powers?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Serena, but your powers can only be modified by the 
Imperium Silver Crystal and you&#39;re the only one who can do it.&quot; 

&quot;Me? But I don&#39;t know how!&quot; 

&quot;Nor do I, so that means you&#39;re stuck with what you&#39;ve got for now. 
Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m sure one day you will learn how to do it,&quot; Luna said 
with a smile. &quot;Now, if you four could please give me your Power Wands, 
we can get the process started.&quot; 

Four hands reached into Lunar Space pockets and came back holding 
their Power Wands. One by one, Artemis went to each Sailor Scout and 
picked up their Wands. He laid them out in a cross pattern in the 
center of the table. When he was finished, he sat down between the 
Jupiter and Venus Wands and nodded to Luna. &quot;Ready on this end.&quot; 

&quot;Good. Serena, you will need to use the power of the Imperium Silver 
Crystal to seal the energy inside the Wands once we&#39;re finished, so it 
would be best if you became the Moon Princess,&quot; Luna said as she sat 
down between the Mercury and Mars Wands. 

Serena stood up and pulled the Crescent Moon Wand out of her Lunar 
Space pocket. She glanced up at Darian and noticed he was shaking his 
head slowly. &quot;What is it?&quot; 

&quot;It just bugs me slightly that you can yank that thing out of nowhere, 
that&#39;s all. It&#39;s like that American television program, &#39;Highlander&#39;,&quot; 
he said with a grin. Everyone except Tolaris chuckled briefly. 

&quot;I take it this is an Earth joke?&quot; Tolaris asked. 

&quot;Yes. I&#39;ll tell you about it later,&quot; Darian said and sat back. 

Serena held up the Wand to eye-level so she could gaze at the Imperium 
Silver Crystal imbedded in the center of the crescent moon. The sign 
of the Moon started to glow on her forehead and her clothes changed 
into the soft white dress of the Moon Princess. &quot;I am ready, Luna,&quot; 
she said softly in a voice that was somehow hers and someone else&#39;s. 

Luna looked at Artemis and he nodded. They both closed their eyes and 
began to concentrate. The crescent moon markings on their foreheads 
began to glow a golden color as the four Power Wands started to rise 
up off of the table like ghosts. Wisps of energy began to form around 
the Wands, slowly enveloping them in gauzy clouds. 

Everyone except the cats looked up as a ghostly image formed above the 
Wands and the streams of energy. A dragon composed of a harsh white 
light was flying with a huge bird covered in fire. Several odd spheres 
seemed to float aimlessly around while a rain of light fell around the 
room. The image only lasted for a few seconds before collapsing into 
four large tendrils of light and energy that wrapped themselves around 
the Power Wands. 

Princess Serena stood up and pointed the Crescent Moon Wand at the 
four Power Wands. She closed her eyes and focused her mind on the 
Imperium Silver Crystal that was her birthright as the Princess of the 
Moon. 

&quot;Cosmic Moon Power....&quot; she intoned, and the Crystal&#39;s energies lashed 
out to surround the Power Wands. The threads of power were quickly 
absorbed by the four wands and they seemed to glow with power. &quot;Now 
summon your Wands, my friends, and receive their powers....&quot; Princess 
Serena said with a soft smile. 

The four Scouts nodded and stood up. They held out their hands, the 
signs of their gods glowing on their foreheads as they concentrated. 
The Power Wands darted away from each other and into the hands of 
their respective Scouts. 

&quot;Whoa, blood rush....&quot; Leda said as the supercharged power flowed 
through her and imprinted itself on her essence. 

&quot;No kidding....&quot; Rei said, momentarily stunned. 

Mina giggled. &quot;This tickles,&quot; she said with a smile. 

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t call it a tickle,&quot; Ami said, frowning slightly. &quot;This 
feels like when I was electrocuted while changing the math 
co-processor on my home computer.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re supposed to unplug it first, Ami,&quot; Mina said as she stretched. 

&quot;I did. I just forgot to discharge the capacitors before I started to 
work on the chip.&quot; 

Mina blinked. &quot;And you say that&#39;s how you felt just a few seconds 
ago?&quot; 

Ami nodded. &quot;Not quite, but it was close enough.&quot; 

Mina thought about it for a second before dismissing the matter. &quot;I 
guess you must not be too ticklish, then.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;d be surprised,&quot; said Tolaris with a smile. Ami gave him a dark 
look and everyone laughed. 

&quot;We&#39;ll discuss this later,&quot; she said. 

&quot;Is that a promise or a threat?&quot; the Dragoon said. 

Artemis coughed. &quot;Before Ami and Tolaris get into a minor fight, I 
just want to make sure that you realize that it will be sometime 
before your powers are fully adjusted,&quot; he said to the Sailor Scouts. 
&quot;Your old powers will work just fine but your supercharged powers 
probably won&#39;t be available for a day or so.&quot; 

&quot;So what are the new powers?&quot; Leda asked. 

Artemis glanced at Luna and the black cat shrugged. &quot;Umm, well, Luna 
and I aren&#39;t quite sure, to be honest. The final configuration of the 
new energy will be done by your essences. It will, of course, fall 
under your domains of power, but the exact form is unknown.&quot; 

&quot;What was that image we saw?&quot; Serena asked. She was her normal self 
again and was casually toying with the Crescent Moon Wand. 

Luna blinked. &quot;What image?&quot; 

Serena explained to her about the image that they saw while the cats 
were busy supercharging the Wands. After Serena had finished 
describing it, Luna remained silent for several seconds as she 
thought. 

&quot;That might very well be the final forms of your new powers,&quot; she 
finally said. &quot;However, I can&#39;t say for sure since the new power forms 
aren&#39;t written in stone.&quot; 

Tolaris stood up and stretched. &quot;Okay, unless anyone has anything 
they&#39;d like to say about this mission, we should break for lunch and 
then start in with training in the combat simulator for tomorrow.&quot; 

&quot;A quick question about that simulator,&quot; Mina said. &quot;You said it could 
be programmed to simulate different environments, right?&quot; 

The Dragoon nodded. &quot;Holographically, of course, but yes.&quot; 

&quot;Could you program it to run us through the route we&#39;re supposed to 
take tomorrow?&quot; 

Tolaris just stared at her. &quot;Mina,&quot; he said after several seconds, 
&quot;Are you sure I can&#39;t convince you to become a Dragoon? I never 
thought of that.&quot; 

The blonde blushed. &quot;No, I&#39;ll stay with being a Sailor Scout.&quot; 

&quot;So what exactly are you talking about?&quot; Rei asked, slightly confused. 

&quot;I&#39;ll show you in a bit, Rei,&quot; said Tolaris. &quot;But first, we need to 
get something to eat first. We&#39;ve got a long day ahead of us and an 
even longer one tomorrow.&quot; 

&quot;Mmmm, what&#39;s for lunch?&quot; Serena asked. 

Leda laughed. &quot;Give me a few minutes and I&#39;ll see what I can whip up. 
Provided, of course, it doesn&#39;t try to eat the cooking utensils as I 
make it.&quot; 

Rei blinked. &quot;Umm.... do I want to ask?&quot; 

&quot;Only if you can tell me what a Smurf is,&quot; Tolaris replied. 

&quot;I&#39;m not hungry anymore,&quot; Mina said with a small frown. 

Darian just sighed and slumped in his chair. &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s going to be 
one of those days, alright....&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Mina slowly entered the room as if every movement made her sore. Her 
hair was still quite damp from the shower and she was wearing a soft 
lavender robe. &quot;And I thought Luna&#39;s training exercises were 
grueling,&quot; she muttered to the room in general. &quot;Anyone got a spare 
pillow?&quot; 

Leda reached behind her and grabbed a pillow at random. She tossed it 
across the room, making a face as the movement made her painfully 
aware of a tender spot in her shoulder. &quot;If this is what we&#39;re going 
up against in the morning, I&#39;m sleeping in,&quot; the brunette said. She 
was sitting cross-legged on a very large pillow, wearing a dark gray 
robe and still dripping slightly from her own shower. 

&quot;You said you wanted to go,&quot; Rei said as she was fussing with her 
hair. She had managed to get most of the water out but now her 
raven-black hair was a mass of tangles. Out of the five girls in the 
room, she alone was wearing a nightgown rather than a bathrobe. &quot;It&#39;s 
not like anyone&#39;s twisting your arm into going if you don&#39;t want to.&quot; 

Leda sighed. &quot;Yeah, I know. I just wish that being shot at didn&#39;t hurt 
so much. How many times did the simulator kill me, twelve?&quot; 

&quot;Thirteen,&quot; said Ami as she ran a brush through her wet hair. &quot;Be glad 
that Tolaris used rubber pellets instead of real ammunition or plasma 
grenades. I was injured eighteen times, but only took lethal damage 
five times.&quot; 

Serena just sighed and rubbed the sore spot on her shoulder and upper 
arm. &quot;So what was the final score, or should I ask?&quot; she said. Her 
hair had gotten badly tangled during the simulation and rather than 
mess with it, she simply undid her hairstyle and let it cascade across 
her shoulders and back. 

Ami sighed and looked at her computer. &quot;Final score was Sailor Scouts 
15, Dragoon Legion 13. A point was awarded to the team with the lowest 
casualty ratio during each simulation. Not very good results, if you 
ask me.&quot; 

&quot;Wonderful,&quot; Mina commented. &quot;So what are the odds that we&#39;ll come 
back in one piece from this mission?&quot; 

Ami poked at her computer for a bit. &quot;According to the simulation, 
we&#39;ve got a 64% chance of overall success but only a 2% chance of all 
of us returning unscratched. Ummm, I have the estimated damage 
breakdown, if you really want to hear it....&quot; 

Leda snorted. &quot;Might as well.&quot; 

&quot;2% chance no damage, 23% chance of us having a wide collection of 
large cuts, scrapes, and bruises, all non-critical. Umm.... a 24% 
chance of one of us coming back in critical condition, 17% chance that 
it&#39;s more of us.... and there&#39;s a 34% chance that at least one of us 
gets killed.&quot; 

Mina sighed. &quot;So basically you&#39;re saying that we&#39;ve got a good chance 
of getting beat up pretty badly, right?&quot; 

Ami nodded slowly. &quot;According to the simulator.&quot; 

Rei coughed. &quot;I&#39;m inclined to trust the simulator, seeing how badly it 
managed to kick our butts at times.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, but we trashed it too, so it pretty much evens out,&quot; replied 
Leda. &quot;Besides, if we don&#39;t have very high chances, then why did we 
score more than the simulation? I mean, when one of us died in the 
sim, there went 17% of our total score. But there were hundreds of 
them, so each one of them was only a fraction of a percent. And we 
still won the most,&quot; she said with a smile. 

&quot;Do we really want to stake our lives on this?&quot; Serena asked quietly. 
&quot;I mean, Tolaris keeps saying it&#39;d be best for him to go alone and to 
be the only one at risk. Do we really want to risk dying for this 
mission?&quot; 

&quot;For the mission, no,&quot; said Ami, just as quietly. &quot;For Tolaris, yes.&quot; 

&quot;You love him that much,&quot; Mina stated. 

&quot;Yes, I do.&quot; 

Leda stretched out her legs, frowning slightly as Mina glanced away. 
&quot;I can say that I don&#39;t think I&#39;d put my life on the line for Tolaris. 
However,&quot; she added as Ami gave her a strange look, &quot;Ami is one of my 
best friends and I&#39;d put my life on the line for her. And I can mean 
that easier than the rest of you because if I die, I don&#39;t have anyone 
who&#39;d really miss me. Except for the rest of you, that is.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d risk my life for one person,&quot; Rei admitted, staring 
down at the pillow she was sitting on, &quot;Even one of you. But for the 
whole team, I&#39;d have to say that I would.&quot; 

&quot;My sentiments exactly,&quot; Mina said. &quot;Someone once said that the needs 
of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one. What&#39;s one life 
compared to the lives of the team? If the Sailor Scouts are going to 
risk their lives for one of their number, I would risk my life for the 
entire team.&quot; 

Serena smiled to herself as she began to put her hair back into its 
usual form. &quot;You do realize that this is a moot point, seeing how you 
four have done so once before and died for it. Fortunately the 
Imperium Silver Crystal was able to bring you back, and I think I know 
why. Such love and friendship for your friends deserves a second 
chance. However, I fear that not even the power of the Crystal can 
bring us back should we fail this time. I need to go into the 
Negaverse, for what purpose I&#39;m not sure, but it makes me feel warm 
and secure inside knowing that my friends are there with me, not 
because they have to, but because they want to.&quot; 

Everyone looked at her and smiled. &quot;Why do I get the feeling that our 
ditzy friend here is starting to emotionally mature?&quot; Rei said. 

&quot;Who are you calling ditzy, Miss Fire-For-Brains?&quot; 

Leda laughed. &quot;Spoke too soon, Rei.&quot; 

Ami smiled. &quot;Perhaps. Unless anyone has any more profound statements 
to make, I&#39;m going to wander off to bed. And the first person to ask 
who&#39;s bed gets bitten,&quot; she said, going vampiric long enough to show 
her tiny fangs. 

Leda&#39;s jaw quickly closed with an audible snap. &quot;Ummm.... sleep well.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll try. Good night, everyone,&quot; Ami said as she stood up and left. 

Mina craned her head around the door and grinned to herself as she saw 
Ami knock softly on Tolaris&#39;s bedroom door. &quot;Guess what, girls? We&#39;re 
going to have thundersnow tonight.&quot; 

Leda&#39;s eyes brightened while Rei&#39;s mood seemed to drop by three 
degrees. Serena looked outside the window and nodded her head. &quot;Well, 
it looks like the snow part is here. Getting rather heavy, too.&quot; 

&quot;We know you don&#39;t like cold and snow, Rei, so you don&#39;t need to start 
in on your usual winter litany,&quot; Mina said quickly as Rei started to 
grumble to herself. 

&quot;Fine, then. I&#39;m going to go mediate in front of a nice, warm, cozy 
fire, if that&#39;s alright with everyone.&quot; She stood up and paused as a 
thought popped into her mind. &quot;Um, where exactly are Artemis and 
Luna?&quot; 

Mina made a face. &quot;Artemis said he found a small colony of field mice 
and invited Luna out for &#39;fine dining&#39;. Haven&#39;t seen either one 
since.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, ick,&quot; the priestess replied. &quot;Sorry I asked. Well, guess I&#39;ll see 
everyone in the morning.&quot; 

&quot;Good night, Rei,&quot; everyone said as she left the room. 

&quot;I guess I&#39;d better get to bed too,&quot; Leda said as she stood up. &quot;Who&#39;s 
room is this, anyway? I know mine&#39;s down the hall, but I don&#39;t 
remember who got what room.&quot; 

Mina shrugged. &quot;This is just an empty room, I think. My room is at the 
other end of the hall, and I think Serena&#39;s room is two doors down.&quot; 

&quot;It is,&quot; Serena said with a smile. &quot;So why did we decide to meet in 
this room instead of any of ours?&quot; 

Mina smiled as she bounced in place. &quot;It had all of the fluffy 
pillows,&quot; she said simply. The three of them laughed for a bit before 
Serena stood up. 

&quot;I&#39;ll see you two in the morning. Sleep well,&quot; she said and headed for 
the door. 

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Mina said with a smile. 

Both Leda and Serena gave her strange looks. &quot;And what&#39;s that supposed 
to mean?&quot; Leda asked. 

Mina shrugged. &quot;Call it a feeling. Anyway,&quot; she said as she stood up. 
She reached down and grabbed the pillow she had been sitting on. &quot;I 
don&#39;t think anyone would mind if I borrowed this for the night, do 
you?&quot; 

Serena shook her head. &quot;Nope. Good night, Mina.&quot; 

&quot;Good night, Serena,&quot; Mina said, and the three of them went to their 
rooms to get ready for bed. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Ami smiled softly and closed the door behind her. &quot;You want some 
company tonight, Tolaris?&quot; she asked quietly as she walked over and 
hugged him. 

The Dragoon gave her an amused look as he finished stripping off his 
dress tunic. &quot;We are going to have a full day tommorrow, my love, so 
we will both need to sleep well.&quot; 

She smiled and stroked his chest. &quot;They say that you sleep better when 
you&#39;re exhausted....&quot; 

&quot;Ami....&quot; he said, both surprised and amused. 

Her mood grew somber as she leaned against him. &quot;Tolaris, there&#39;s a 
good chance that we&#39;ll be badly injured on this mission, possibly even 
killed....&quot; 

&quot;All the more reason for you and the Sailor Scouts to remain here,&quot; he 
interrupted, hugging her tightly. 

&quot;Tolaris....&quot; she started to say but was cut off by a passionate kiss. 

&quot;I know, Ami. I can&#39;t force you to stay nor would I try,&quot; he said when 
they broke apart. &quot;And I understand why you and the others want to 
come with me. I don&#39;t like the idea of you being in danger, Ami, but 
I&#39;ll do what I can to keep you and your friends as safe as possible.&quot; 

She hugged him as tight as she could, not sure of what else to say. 
She listened to his heart beating in his chest and was soothed by the 
sound. &quot;I love you,&quot; she said softly. 

Tolaris brushed his lips across her forehead. &quot;And I love you, Ami.&quot; 

She sighed in contentment as she bent her head up to kiss him. 
&quot;Tolaris, will you make love to me?&quot; she asked softly. 

The Dragoon&#39;s response was to gently pick her up in his arms and kiss 
her thoroughly. &quot;This is going against my better judgement,&quot; he said 
with a soft smile. &quot;But then again, I never was good with matters of 
the heart.&quot; 

&quot;Fortunately for me,&quot; she said as she was carried over to the bed. He 
looked at her before shaking his head in wonder. He carefully set her 
down and gave her a gentle but passionate kiss. 

The kiss lasted well into the night before the Dragoon Commander and 
the Sailor Scout turned their attentions to other matters of the 
heart.... 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Mina entered the room and closed the door behind her without making 
any sound at all. Moving silently was a skill she had picked up as 
Sailor V and often surprised herself by the number of situations in 
which it had come in handy. Situations like the one she was in now. 

Glancing up to make sure she hadn&#39;t been noticed, she turned her 
attention to the small control panel on the wall. She had figured out 
that they were the controls to the lighting and outside window shields 
for the room. She swiftly reprogrammed them to a specific pattern and 
paused with her hand hovering over the &#39;commit&#39; switch, studying the 
room&#39;s sole occupant. 

Leda was still dressed in her robe and standing in front of the 
windows, looking out into the snowstorm but not seeing. The reflection 
in the glass was that of a young woman who was deeply lost in thought 
and memory. Her hand slowly trailed down her throat and idly toyed 
with the sash to the robe, as if she wanted it opened by someone other 
than her. 

Mina&#39;s hand pressed the switch and she quickly moved back into the 
shadow in the doorway. Leda blinked as the lights started to dim and a 
low rumbling sound could be heard. She watched in silent surprise as 
reinforced bulkheads slid over the outside windows, cutting off all 
view of the outside world and plunging the room into utter darkness. 

The heavy rumbling was replaced with the soft whine of servo motors as 
the track lighting system was swiftly redesigned and the various 
spotlights began to move. The process finished several seconds later 
and all was quiet. 

A single spotlight lit up, casting down a sharply defined cone of 
light and illuminating Mina. The lighting was such that very little 
could be seen past the cone of light, and what could be seen were 
vague shadows of gray. The shadows seemed to part as Leda approached 
the very edge of the light. 

Nothing was said as each looked at the other. Leda appeared to have 
lost most of her color while Mina&#39;s features were sharply accented by 
the light, concealing her eyes in pools of shadow. After a few seconds 
of silence, Mina slowly untied her robe and let it fall to the floor, 
leaving her standing naked in the light. She held out her hand, as if 
offering herself to the brunette. 

Leda remained utterly motionless, not even appearing to breathe. After 
a few seconds, Mina let her hand fall to her side and nodded once. She 
turned around and picked up her robe, silently wondering where she 
miscalculated. She froze as she felt a pair of hands on her shoulders, 
gently rubbing and kneading the muscles. 

The blonde&#39;s hair was gently pushed aside and she felt Leda&#39;s lips 
brush across the back of her neck. Mina shivered lightly at the 
sensation and felt her body start to respond. She started to twist 
around but the hands on her shoulders tightened gently, keeping her in 
place. 

Leda continued to lightly massage Mina&#39;s shoulders and neck for 
several minutes before slowly guiding her over to the bed. Everything 
became shades of black as they left the cone of light and the girls 
found themselves feeling alone in a void, comforted only by the 
intimate presence of the other. 

The hands on her shoulders gently pushed Mina down on her stomach and 
a pillow was placed near her head. She grabbed the pillow and tucked 
it beneath her chin, placing her arms by her side. She heard a rustle 
of fabric and felt Leda&#39;s bare body pressing against hers as the 
brunette kissed her ear. 

Mina felt Leda&#39;s hands on her shoulders again, only this time her 
touch was firm and strong as she slowly massaged the tension out of 
the muscles in the blonde&#39;s back. Almost immediately Mina started to 
feel relaxed and she felt her body surrendering to her friend&#39;s 
skilled touch. 

She lost track of time as the pleasure and relaxation pushed her mind 
to the brink of falling asleep. She was dimly aware of rolling over, 
but she woke up almost instantly as Leda gave her a gentle kiss before 
starting in on the intimate massage.... 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Serena paused in front of the door, trying to decide if she really 
wanted to try her plan. Indecision gnawed on the edge of her mind 
before she gathered her courage together and choose a course of 
action. Here goes nothing, she thought as she softly knocked on the 
door. 

&quot;Come in,&quot; said the faint voice from the other side. 

Serena opened the door and went inside, making sure that she closed 
the door behind her. She quietly made her way into the room, not 
looking up at the room&#39;s occupant until she was a few feet away from 
him. When she did look up, she smiled at the image she saw. 

Darian was standing by the window, wearing a pair of faded gray 
sweatpants and holding a rather sizable scimitar in his hand. Behind 
him, the falling snow was starting to pile up against the bottom of 
the window, creating the illusion of the two of them trapped together 
in the room. 

He gave her a funny look as she approached, still smiling rather 
oddly. &quot;Hello, Serena,&quot; he said softly. &quot;What&#39;s with you? You look 
like a cat that just ate a bunch of goldfish.&quot; 

&quot;Just my mind sinking down to Leda&#39;s level, that&#39;s all.&quot; 

He blinked in confusion. &quot;And what&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot; 

She gestured to the curved blade he was holding. &quot;Is that your sword, 
Darian, or are you just happy to see me?&quot; she giggled. 

Darian sighed as he picked up the sword&#39;s scabbard from the bed and 
deftly slid the blade inside. &quot;Sorry I asked,&quot; he said, laying the 
scimitar against the tiny nightstand. &quot;So what&#39;s on your mind that you 
wanted to see me at this hour?&quot; he said, leaning against the wall. 

&quot;I just wanted to be with you for awhile,&quot; she said softly. &quot;That, and 
I wanted to sleep in your arms again....&quot; 

He frowned lightly. &quot;Is that wise? I mean, I don&#39;t want to upset Luna 
or anything....&quot; 

Serena smiled again as she moved closer to him. &quot;Artemis and Luna are 
out hunting field mice tonight. Luna likes doing that and she hasn&#39;t 
had much time to do so lately, so I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll spend most of the 
night hunting. Depending on how much snow there is, she might even 
spend the night in a tree.&quot; 

The thought of the serious and civilized cat sleeping in a tree like a 
wild animal brought a smile to Darian&#39;s lips. &quot;Now that would be a 
sight to see.... Luna taking a nap up in a snow-covered tree in some 
yard. You wouldn&#39;t have thought that cats would go hunting in the snow 
and....&quot; 

He trailed off as his attention was diverted by the glimpse of motion 
out of the corner of his eye. He turned to look in time to catch a 
puddle of pink terry cloth form at Serena&#39;s feet. It&#39;s a robe, his 
mind instantly identified it as. His mind locked up as further 
implications sank in. It&#39;s her robe. Which means she&#39;s not wearing it 
anymore. 

Darian&#39;s brain wasn&#39;t sure of its original analysis so it repeated the 
logical progression of identification a second time before it sank in. 
Almost immediately, he broke out in a cold sweat as fully half of his 
brain shut down. Hesitantly, he began to look up. 

His gaze slowly worked its way up her sleek and slender legs. They 
were smooth and nicely formed with just the right amount of muscle, a 
pleasant side effect from her Sailor Scout training. She was wearing a 
pair of light pink panties, cut high enough to allow a great deal of 
unrestricted mobility while still remaining decent. 

His eyes wandered further up, across the smooth expanse of her 
stomach. Like her legs, it was also well-formed and in excellent 
condition, despite her constant snacking on sugar and sweets. His gaze 
flicked to her sides to study her strong and slender arms, again a 
side effect of her continuous training. 

His gaze wandered up further to her chest and discovered that she 
wasn&#39;t wearing anything else. Her breasts were small and firm, being 
absolutely perfect for her size. Her rosy nipples were starting to 
tighten in response to his scrutiny and he could feel the heat rising 
in his face. 

He looked further up, past the tender skin of her chest and throat, 
and looked into her blue eyes. She had a soft smile on her face and 
the expression of love in her eyes as she gazed back at him, seeming 
to be comfortable with her state of undress in his presence. 

She reached behind her and undid her hairstyle, letting her blonde 
hair cascade down her shoulders and almost down to her ankles. She 
stepped closer to Darian and slowly ran her hand across his cheek. 
&quot;You seem lost, Darian,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;Tell me, do you like what 
you see?&quot; 

&quot;Very much, my love,&quot; he replied and kissed her. 

She kissed back with equal passion, wrapping her arms around him and 
hugging him tightly. They spent several seconds frozen in that 
position, their shadows imprinted on the wall by the light of the moon 
from above. Time seemed to stand still, the only indication that it 
still flowed was the steady and silent accumulation of snowflakes from 
the storm. 

Serena gently pulled away from Darian and moved over to the bed. She 
laid down and stretched provocatively, making sure she had his full 
attention. She glanced up at him and smiled at his expression. She 
slid beneath the sheets and moved over, making room for him to lie 
down as well. 

&quot;Darian?&quot; she said quietly. 

It took him several seconds to find his voice. &quot;Yes, Serena?&quot; 

&quot;Come to bed. It&#39;s late and we both need to get a good night&#39;s sleep.&quot; 

He blinked as he slowly sank down on the bed, wondering just how he 
had gotten into this situation. He tried to think about it but the 
sight of a very beautiful, half-naked Serena in his bed precluded any 
serious brain activity. 

He settled himself down and stretched as well, a distant but 
functional part of his mind making note of the fact that he had 
several minor aches in his shoulders. Serena moved over next to him 
and laid her head on his chest. He reflexively put his arms around her 
and found that it felt natural for the both of them to be in bed 
together, despite their state of undress. 

&quot;Darian, I love you,&quot; Serena said, her mind already well on its way to 
the world of sleep and dreams. 

Darian tilted his head down and kissed her ear. &quot;I love you too, 
Serena,&quot; he said. He closed his eyes and was surprised at how calm and 
relaxed he had gotten in the past few minutes. Maybe there&#39;s something 
to this after all, he thought to himself. 

It was his last conscious thought before sleep claimed both of them, 
still held in each other&#39;s arms. Outside, the snow continued to fall 
silently, the only sound coming from the faint rumblings of thunder 
coming from the leading edge of a newly summoned storm. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Rei finished a rather lengthy fire meditation ritual and decided that 
now would be an ideal time to get some sleep. She rose from her 
kneeling position and stretched, noting with slight amazement that the 
aches in her joints seemed to have significantly lessened. This is 
interesting, she thought as she walked over to her overnight bag. I 
should be feeling tired after today&#39;s workout but I&#39;m not. I wonder 
how long I&#39;ve been meditating? 

She reached into her bag and pulled out her alarm clock. She glanced 
at the display and almost dropped it. She rubbed her eyes with her 
free hand and looked at it again, trying to make sure she saw it 
correctly. Seven in the morning?! she thought. Is this for real? 

She swiftly walked over to the controls to the window shields and hit 
the toggle. The protective bulkheads started to retract from the 
windows and Rei blinked as sunlight flooded the small room. This is 
too weird, she thought, when did I fall asleep? She searched her 
memory for anything unusual that occurred while she was meditating, 
but she could find nothing that indicated when or even if she fell 
asleep. 

Oh, well, as long as I&#39;m not tired, she thought as she unbuttoned her 
nightgown. She quickly changed into her usual ceremonial robes and 
started to pack everything together. Her task was interrupted by a 
soft knocking at her door. 

&quot;Come in,&quot; she called out as she finished stuffing everything into her 
overnight bag. She smiled at her visitor as he stepped into the room. 
&quot;Good morning, Commander.&quot; 

Tolaris nodded to her. &quot;More often than not, that&#39;s an opinion and not 
a greeting. I trust you slept well?&quot; 

&quot;Funny you should say that. I don&#39;t recall ever falling asleep. I&#39;m 
not tired or anything,&quot; she quickly added as the Dragoon frowned, 
&quot;It&#39;s just that I have no idea when I fell asleep and when I woke up. 
I swear it felt like I spent the whole night meditating.&quot; 

Tolaris blinked and looked at her. &quot;It&#39;s possible that you never 
actually fell asleep, Rei. It&#39;s common for those highly skilled in the 
meditive arts to spend the night in prayer and be refreshed as if they 
had slept well, yet they remain fully awake at all times. But that&#39;s 
usually a highly advanced skill and I wouldn&#39;t think that you would be 
able to do such a thing right now.&quot; 

Rei shrugged. &quot;Perhaps. You did say I had potential, right?&quot; 

&quot;A vast amount of potential. It doesn&#39;t matter right now, just as long 
as you&#39;re awake when we go in. Everyone&#39;s starting to get up and 
gather together for breakfast and last-minute preparation. Are you all 
set?&quot; 

She nodded. &quot;Just finished packing. Let me take care of the fire first 
and I&#39;ll be down for breakfast shortly.&quot; 

Tolaris laughed quietly. &quot;All too easily taken care of,&quot; he said as a 
miniature raincloud formed over the fire. The cloud rumbled quietly to 
itself as it began to rain on the fire, extinguishing it within 
seconds. The downpour continued for a few more seconds to ensure the 
fire was out before the cloud dispersed and a tiny tornado formed in 
its place. The swirling winds gathered up all of the ashes in its 
funnel and drifted towards the direction of the trash can. 

&quot;It must be convenient to be able to do that,&quot; Rei said as she watched 
the tornado dump the wet ash into the trash and dispersed itself. 

&quot;It does have its uses,&quot; the Dragoon said with a smile. &quot;Come on, Leda 
said she&#39;d be cooking something special for breakfast this morning. 
She won&#39;t tell me what, except that it won&#39;t do anything like eat the 
plate as she serves it.&quot; 

Rei blinked as she picked up her bag. &quot;Do you often have that 
problem?&quot; she asked as she followed Tolaris out of the room. 

&quot;It all depends on what you decide to call lunch. A basic rule of 
thumb is if it screams when you poke it with your fork, it&#39;s not food 
yet, but there are some exceptions.&quot; 

The priestess blanched. &quot;Uh huh.... Tell me, how long are we going to 
be in the Negaverse?&quot; 

Tolaris laughed. &quot;Long enough for dinner, if that&#39;s what you meant.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s what I thought. Maybe we can get Leda to make us some 
sandwiches before we go in....&quot; 

The sound of the Dragoon&#39;s laughter echoed down the hall for quite 
some time as they made there way through the cathedral towards the 
kitchen. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Everyone was gathered together in the central hall of the cathedral 
for what Tolaris called &quot;an attitude check&quot;. Luna and Artemis were 
sitting off to one side, watching carefully but not interfering. 

&quot;Alright, everyone, if I can have your attention?&quot; the Dragoon said in 
a gentle but commanding tone. Everyone looked up at him except Serena, 
who was still staring at the star mosaic on the ceiling. Tolaris 
sighed quietly and coughed loudly. &quot;Serena, can you stop staring at 
the Astroglobe long enough for me to get this taken care of?&quot; 

The blonde blushed a vivid shade of crimson and sheepishly turned to 
look at him. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she apologized. 

&quot;Okay, everyone, it&#39;s almost party time and I&#39;m going to give it to 
you straight. First off, I want it understood that I will command this 
mission. Sailor Moon is your team leader and you can follow whatever 
orders she gives you, but everyone will do what I say, when I say, and 
if you have a problem with this, either speak up now or keep quiet.&quot; 

Everyone blinked at the sudden change of Tolaris&#39;s demeanor but no one 
spoke. After a few seconds, Tolaris nodded and continued. &quot;I know this 
sounds harsh, but we&#39;re going into hostile territory, and if I 
understand the slang correctly, this isn&#39;t going to be a picnic in the 
park. If I give an order, it will be with good reason and will most 
likely wind up saving your collective butts. But you have to follow it 
for it to work, so we&#39;re placing our lives in your hands. Is everyone 
still with me?&quot; 

They all nodded and the Dragoon commander sighed quietly. &quot;Good. Now 
no offense, Miss Moon, but if we were in the Negaverse, your 
inattention could have very well been a fatal mistake. I&#39;ve lived in 
the Negaverse for all of my life, and there is still alot about it 
that can surprise even me. You have to suspect everything, trust 
nothing and no one except your teammates, and always watch your butt. 
And when I say everything, I mean everything. You wouldn&#39;t think that 
ant would hurt, but it&#39;s bite might contain a toxin strong enough to 
kill you in eight seconds flat. You might not think that rock is 
alive, but you&#39;d be surprised when the mimic opens up its mouth and 
eats your face. I&#39;ve seen all of this stuff happen before and it is 
not a pretty sight.&quot; 

Darian was the only one able to speak after Tolaris fell silent. 
&quot;Excuse me, Commander, but just how common are these little 
surprises?&quot; he said rather calmly. 

&quot;Fortunately, a&#39;vechs and mimics are quite rare. However, there is 
quite alot of other harmful surprises out there, so I had to make sure 
you understood the extent of the dangers. You do understand what I 
mean, right?&quot; 

Everyone nodded with varying degrees of horror and fear etched on 
their faces. &quot;Maybe this isn&#39;t such a good idea after all....&quot; Serena 
said, her voice quivering with fear. 

The Dragoon rubbed his temples. &quot;It never was, Serena. And if you, any 
of you, don&#39;t like this well enough to come along, then by all means 
stay here with Artemis and Luna.&quot; 

No one spoke as Tolaris looked each one of them in the eyes, making 
sure that he or she knew what they wanted and what they were doing. He 
finished his sweep of the room&#39;s occupants and nodded slowly. 

&quot;Very well. I just want to say that I have a great deal of respect for 
your courage and dedication to this. I just hope that same courage 
will hold out for this. Okay, weapons check, everyone.&quot; 

Ami, Rei, Leda, and Mina all pulled their daggers out of their 
respective Lunar Space pockets while Darian picked up his scimitar 
from where he had left it leaning against the wall. Serena, who chose 
not to carry a dagger, pulled the Crescent Moon Wand out of her own 
Lunar Pocket and started to look it over. 

&quot;You know, Darian,&quot; Rei said conversationally as she slid her 
ceremonial dagger out of it&#39;s sheath, &quot;You never told us why you 
picked a scimitar rather than a dagger. Isn&#39;t it kinda heavy?&quot; 

Darian smiled as the scimitar slid out of the scabbard with a loud 
hissing sound. &quot;Just a little, but I&#39;m used to it. I&#39;ve used a sword 
before, back on in the Moon Kingdom as Prince Darian, remember?&quot; 

Rei nodded slightly. &quot;No, but I&#39;ll take your word for it.&quot; 

Darian shrugged. &quot;Anyway, I&#39;ve always wanted to own a scimitar. I 
guess I spent too much time watching movies like &#39;Lawrence of Arabia&#39; 
as a kid.&quot; 

Leda snickered. &quot;And I thought you&#39;d want a katana like &#39;Highlander&#39;.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s what I want after I manage to acquire a scimitar....&quot; 

Mina tested the balance of her dagger and glanced up at Serena. 
&quot;Serena, how come you didn&#39;t want a dagger? I know you don&#39;t care for 
them, but having a backup weapon never hurts.&quot; 

Serena stared into the Imperium Silver Crystal and sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t 
know, it.... it just didn&#39;t feel right.&quot; She looked up and shrugged. 
&quot;I guess it doesn&#39;t make any sense, does it?&quot; 

Mina smiled. &quot;No, but no one said it had to.&quot; 

Ami looked at Tolaris and blinked. &quot;What is that?&quot; she asked, pointing 
to the small cylinder he was holding. It was made out of a strange 
type of wood and was only eight inches long. 

The Dragoon smiled and squeezed the cylinder. An odd liquid sound 
filled the room as the cylinder lengthened out to six feet and a very 
wicked steel tip formed at one end. &quot;Symipa. The traditional weapon of 
the Dragoons, if you will. Raijen used to use one himself as an 
emergency weapon and I guess it formed a tradition. It&#39;s an 
extra-tough steel-tipped spear that can fold in on itself into a 
small, easily-concealed cylinder. The only problem is that the mass 
never changes so the cylinder is not only dense but ultra-heavy.&quot; 

&quot;How does it change?&quot; Serena asked, her blue eyes wide with wonder. 

&quot;It&#39;s made out of a speical material. Synthetic mimetic polyatomic 
alloy, if I remember the acronym correctly. The stuff is quite useful 
since you can program it to take virtually any shape you want. The 
only problem is that the program itself is unbelievably huge and 
complex, and our current technology is such that we can&#39;t make really 
complicated objects.&quot; 

Mina frowned. &quot;You said Raijen used one of those? But I thought he 
lived three thousand years ago.&quot; 

&quot;He did. He was born slightly over five thousand years ago and lived 
to be around two thousand six hundred years old. However, despite the 
sizable time gap, the symipa technology hasn&#39;t progressed much. Go 
figure,&quot; he added with a shrug. &quot;Anyway, does anyone have any problems 
with your weapons?&quot; 

They all shook their heads and Tolaris smiled. &quot;Okay, everyone. Load 
up and prepare to enter the Negaverse. If you have to use the 
bathroom, now&#39;s the time since there won&#39;t be any &#39;civilized&#39; 
facilities available until we get back here.&quot; 

He blinked in surprise as the five girls suddenly made a mad-dash for 
the bathrooms. He leaned against the wall and laughed quietly as he 
put his symipa in the holster inside his uniform jacket. &quot;The one and 
only definite proof of male superiority,&quot; he said to Darian. 

&quot;The ability to use the bathroom standing up?&quot; 

&quot;Exactly.&quot; 

Artemis snickered quietly to himself and got a tail slapped in his 
face by a slightly irritated Luna. He blinked and calmed down, but not 
without giving the two guys a knowing smile. 

The girls returned in a surprisingly short amount of time. Tolaris was 
going to ask what kept them but decided that now would not be an ideal 
time to irritate his teammates. &quot;If everyone&#39;s finished, then you 
should transform and get this party started.&quot; 

The Sailor Scouts smiled and nodded to each other. Four cylinders and 
a hand were held up to the sky as they activated their transformation 
powers. 

&quot;Moon Prism Power!&quot; 

&quot;Mercury Power!&quot; 

&quot;Mars Power!&quot; 

&quot;Jupiter Power!&quot; 

&quot;Venus Power!&quot; 

Darian smiled as he reached inside his jacket and pulled out a rose in 
full bloom. He silently concentrated and his body started to shimmer 
with light as he also started to transform. 

Tolaris and the two cats watched as the room was filled with light and 
the energy from the Sailor Scouts and Tuxedo Mask. Eventually, the 
light faded and they were fully ready for whatever came their way. 

&quot;It is always interesting to watch you transform,&quot; the Dragoon said as 
they did a series of quick stretches and exercises. &quot;It might be a 
good idea to test your powers before we go in.&quot; 

&quot;Right,&quot; said Sailor Moon. She removed her tiara and concentrated. The 
golden tiara melted and reformed into a shimmering disc of energy in 
her and and she smiled. &quot;Moon Tiara checks out.&quot; 

Sailor Mercury cross her arms in front of her and focused her mind. A 
mote of energy gathered together and grew into a sizable sphere of 
power. She held it in place for a few seconds before letting it 
disperse in a harmless puff of vapor. &quot;Mercury Bubbles, check.&quot; 

Sailor Mars clapped her hands together in front of her and extended 
her pointer fingers. She concentrated and a miniature fireball formed 
at the tips of her extended fingers. The fireball crackled to itself 
before she let it vanish with a pop. &quot;Mars Fire, check.&quot; 

Sailor Jupiter closed her eyes and crossed her arms in front of her, 
her second and fifth fingers forming a V on either hand. A slender rod 
extended from her tiara and started to crackle with static 
electricity. She let the charge build up before it discharged in a 
harmless pop and the rod folded back down into her tiara. &quot;Jupiter 
Thunder, check.&quot; 

Sailor Venus held up a finger to the sky and concentrated. Two balls 
of light formed at her fingertip and became a pair of crescent moon 
beams. She let the beams strengthen in intensity before letting them 
fade into nothing. &quot;Venus Crescent Beams, check.&quot; 

Everyone jumped as a rose imbedded itself in the middle of the floor. 
&quot;It looks like I&#39;m ready,&quot; Tuxedo Mask said softly. &quot;Didn&#39;t mean to 
surprise you all like that....&quot; 

Sailor Moon smiled as she bent down to pick up the rose. She yelped as 
a thorn pierced her glove and drew blood. &quot;Ouch, that hurt!&quot; she said 
as she picked up the rose a little more carefully. 

&quot;You alright?&quot; Mercury asked, her gaze fixated on the tiny drops of 
blood on Sailor Moon&#39;s white gloves. 

Sailor Moon didn&#39;t miss where her friend&#39;s attention was directed. 
&quot;Umm, are you okay, Mercury? When was the last time you were fed?&quot; 

The vampire blushed when she realized what she was doing. &quot;Just last 
week when I drained you. I&#39;m not hungry or anything, just....&quot; She 
trailed off, unable to voice what she was feeling. 

&quot;As long as we don&#39;t have to worry about you getting hungry, we won&#39;t 
have any problems,&quot; Tolaris said as he drew a strange crystal out of 
his pocket. The gem was an eerie purple color that shimmered oddly in 
the light. Everyone blinked and looked at it, captivated by the 
strange color. 

&quot;Hey, that&#39;s pretty.... What is it?&quot; Jupiter asked in fascination. 

The Dragoon smiled. &quot;A Silkworm crystal, and our ticket into and out 
of the Negaverse.&quot; He concentrated briefly and a swirling vortex 
opened up on the far side of the room. Through it they could see a 
small grove of trees that marked the start of their journey. 

&quot;Everyone set?&quot; Commander Tolaris asked and everyone nodded. &quot;Well 
then, ladies and gentlemen, it&#39;s party time,&quot; he said and stepped 
towards the portal between Earth and the Negaverse. One by one, the 
Sailor Scouts followed him across the room towards the portal. Tuxedo 
Mask picked up his scimitar, hooked the scabbard onto his belt, and 
hurried after them. 

&quot;Good luck, everyone.&quot; Luna said as they stepped into the wormhole. 
Only Sailor Moon turned around and nodded before they set off, 
disappearing from the cat&#39;s line of sight almost instantly. Behind 
them, the vortex shimmered and collapsed, leaving Artemis and Luna 
alone in the cathedral. 

&quot;You think they&#39;ll be okay in there?&quot; Artemis asked quietly. 

&quot;I hope so, Artemis. I really hope so....&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Captain Whisper turned around as the three Dragoons entered General 
Rune&#39;s chambers. She smiled and nodded her head in respect to 
Shar-Tei. &lt;So how&#39;s everything going in the Intelligence business?&gt; 
she telepathed to the Dragoon commander. 

&quot;It&#39;s been a headache, Captain,&quot; Shar-Tei replied. She turned slightly 
and bowed before General Rune. Behind her, Lieutenants Maze and Ra&#39;vel 
also bowed to the raven-haired general. 

Rune gave Whisper an amused glance. &quot;Telepathing behind my back again, 
Captain? Shame on you.&quot; 

Whisper smiled and ran her fingers through her pale green hair. &quot;Have 
a bit of faith, General. You know I wouldn&#39;t telepath about people 
behind their backs.&quot; 

Ra&#39;vel chirped quietly. &lt;Captain would&gt; she telepathed to the Psi-Corp 
officer. 

&lt;Hush&gt; was the swift reply. 

Rune smiled at the two telepaths. &quot;I don&#39;t know what you two say, but 
I can feel it when you telepath.&quot; 

Whisper blinked. &quot;You can?&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s only a faint buzzing feeling within my mind, but yes. If there 
were a group of you I couldn&#39;t pinpoint it, but since there&#39;s only two 
people in this room with telepathic capabilities, it&#39;s not that hard 
to figure out who&#39;s doing what.&quot; 

Maze snickered quietly to himself as both Ra&#39;vel and Whisper blushed 
in embarrassment. Shar-Tei gave her second-in-command a patient look 
and he fell silent, but not without giving Ra&#39;vel a knowing smirk. 

Rune cleared her throat. &quot;Now then, let&#39;s get down to business. Report 
on your current project, Captain?&quot; 

Whisper nodded and her demeanor changed slightly. &quot;We&#39;re ready to 
begin the testing phase of the prototype cataport now, General Rune.&quot; 

Maze frowned lightly. &quot;Begging the captain&#39;s pardon, but don&#39;t you 
mean prototype catapult?&quot; 

Whisper gave the Dragoon a patient smile. Had the suggestion been from 
some other officer she would had gotten rather annoyed. However, she 
had spent a great deal of time working with Maze and had become good 
friends so she had an extra bit of tolerance for his occassional 
interjections. 

&quot;I know what I mean, Lieutenant. The cataport is a catapult attached 
to an artificially generated jump gate. When the projectile is fired, 
it only travels a very short distance before hitting the gate. The 
gate teleports it across a surprisingly large distance, rendering the 
projectile completely undetectable and unexpected until it appears 
over the intended target.&quot; 

Maze&#39;s tan eyes went wide as the implications sank in. Ra&#39;vel blinked 
in confusion and chirped to herself. &lt;Projectile teleport exist 
before. Why needed prototype?&gt; the avian telepathed to everyone in the 
room. 

The Psi-Corp captain smiled. &quot;Tell me, Lieutenant, what&#39;s the farthest 
you can teleport a six-hundred pound object?&quot; 

&lt;Teleport cannot&gt; 

&quot;Exactly. The cataport will be able to teleport the projectile well 
over seven standard miles in mid-flight,&quot; Whisper said with a touch of 
pride. 

Maze discreetly reached out to prevent his friend from staggering. 
Ra&#39;vel blinked again and did her best to stay on her feet. Out of the 
three Dragoons, she alone knew the extreme level of power needed to 
teleport that level of mass across that distance. 

&lt;Where power sufficient get teleport available?&gt; she telepathed. Her 
state of shock rendered her speech syntax even more fragmented, but 
Whisper had known Ra&#39;vel for centuries and was used to decrypting her 
statements. 

&quot;We&#39;re using a vast array of psionically supercharged crystals to act 
as batteries for the jump gate. It does take a very large amount of 
energy but since everyone from the Psi-Corp recharges the crystals 
when they can, we have an even greater amount of energy stored for 
use.&quot; 

General Rune gave Whisper an odd look. &quot;Tell me, Captain, was this 
energy storage plan implemented before or after the Psi-Corp took 
heavy losses against the Sailor Scouts?&quot; 

Whisper&#39;s pale green eyes grew cold at the mention of the losses. 
Ra&#39;vel chirped quietly and stepped back as she sensed the captain&#39;s 
change in mood. Everyone knew that Whisper resented her sudden 
promotion to Captain when Queen Beryl was destroyed and fully ninety 
percent of the Psi-Corp was killed in the battle against the Sailor 
Scouts. 

&quot;The plans for the cataport were conceived after your ascension to 
power, General Rune, so all of the power was drawn from the current 
ranks of the Corp as well as from a few psionic volunteers, most 
notably General Al&#39;vexi.&quot; 

Rune smiled at the mention of her old friend. &quot;I trust she&#39;s enjoying 
her retirement?&quot; 

&quot;Very, considering there aren&#39;t too many denizens who&#39;ve managed to 
live as long as she has,&quot; Whisper said, still in a dark mood. 

Rune looked at the Dragoon commander and frowned lightly. &quot;You look 
like you&#39;re thinking about something, Shar-Tei. Tell me what&#39;s on your 
mind.&quot; 

Shar-Tei sighed and ran her fingers through her silvery hair. &quot;I&#39;m not 
sure why you requested two Dragoons for assignment to a Psi-Corp 
project. Not that I have any objections yet, General, but I&#39;m just 
curious.&quot; 

&quot;I didn&#39;t just want two Dragoons, Commander, I wanted Lieutenants Maze 
and Ra&#39;vel on this assignment for a specific reason,&quot; Rune said. &quot;And 
before you ask, that reason is none of your concern. Captain Whisper, 
do you have a test site for your prototype?&quot; 

Whisper nodded. &quot;We plan to use the proving grounds in the 
northwestern flatlands.&quot; She didn&#39;t dare glance to her side to see 
Shar-Tei&#39;s expression at being cut off so sharply. 

Rune pulled a tiny crystal out of her pocket and tossed it to Whisper. 
&quot;Use these coordinates as the testing site. As for the test 
projectile, I have my own project I wish to test. On that crystal is 
the cipher code for the security lock on the Lex&#39;eri storage facility. 
Inside you will find three crystal fragmentation grenades the size of 
fully-grown weavers. Use one for your test projectile and report back 
to me everything you can gather about the results.&quot; 

The Psi-Corp Captain blinked and looked at the crystal, a small 
trickle of uneasiness making its way down her back. I don&#39;t like this, 
she thought to herself. &quot;Of course, General Rune. It will take 
approximately an hour to align the jump gate to these coordinates 
before we can test-fire the cataport.&quot; 

Rune nodded. &quot;Just make sure that the field of fire is clear before 
you start launching grenades. We don&#39;t want to wind up puncturing 
anyone with sharp spines, now, do we? Dismissed.&quot; 

Everyone bowed and turned to walk off to their respective assignments. 
&quot;Commander Shar-Tei, a word with you, please,&quot; Rune said politely but 
in a tone that made it clear that it was an order and not a 
suggestion. Shar-Tei nodded and waited until the others had left 
before speaking. 

&quot;You wished to speak with me, General?&quot; she said neutrally. 

&quot;I happened to look through the various reports on my desk this 
morning and noticed that you applied for the promotion to full 
Commander. I&#39;m curious as to why you did this now and not before. If I 
remember right, you said it was because Commander Tolaris still 
lived.&quot; 

&quot;Correct, General Rune.&quot; 

Rune frowned. &quot;And I am to believe the situation has changed?&quot; 

Shar-Tei nodded slowly. &quot;Yes, General. I.... took the liberty of 
giving Commander Tolaris the final peace befitting of a Dragoon. His 
crystal has been destroyed and Lieutenant Ra&#39;vel was witness to it.&quot; 

The raven-haired general sat back in silence, deeply lost in thought. 
&quot;I see, Commander....&quot; she said slowly. &quot;Were Queen Beryl still here, 
I have no doubt you would suffer the same fate for interfering. 
However, I am in charge now and I&#39;m not Beryl. I will consider your 
punishment, if any, for your actions and will also consider your 
request for promotion to full commander. In the meantime, perhaps it 
would be wise for you to be occupied elsewhere as I have a lot of 
thinking to do. Dismissed, Commander.&quot; 

The Dragoon bowed and silently left the room. General Rune sat back in 
her seat and did not move for several minutes. She eventually focused 
her attention long enough to speak to the room. 

&quot;V&#39;Kreeth, come here,&quot; she said quietly. 

A shadow detached itself from the other shadows and moved to stand 
next to Rune&#39;s side. &quot;I assume you want to review the hunter-scout&#39;s 
data logs from its mission to Earth?&quot; he said in a dry, hissing voice. 

&quot;For a start,&quot; she replied wearily. &quot;That, and get me something for a 
headache. I have the feeling that this one is going to get worse, and 
soon. Very, very soon....&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Tolaris leaned against the ancient tree and gave Tuxedo Mask a look of 
patient suffering. &quot;Why do I get the feeling that bringing them along 
was a bad idea?&quot; he asked, nodding his head towards the small cluster 
of chaos in the forest clearing. 

Tuxedo Mask smiled. &quot;Probably because they&#39;re having an absolute fit 
over that rat-thing. Are you sure it&#39;s harmless?&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s a rakketh, and it&#39;s quite harmless. I think it resembles a cross 
between a spider and an Earth rat, only smaller and uglier.&quot; 

Just then, Sailor Moon ran past them, screaming, &quot;Kill it! Kill it! 
Kill it!&quot; Behind her, something with many legs and even more hair had 
grabbed onto the end of her hairstyle and was holding on for dear 
life. The rest of the Sailor Scouts were running after her, trying to 
get her to hold still long enough so they could remove it. 

&quot;Why is it.... she could never.... run like this before?&quot; puffed 
Sailor Mars as she ran after their screaming leader. 

&quot;She never had that hanging on to her hair before,&quot; Mercury said. She 
had her computer in her hands and was trying to scan the creature. &quot;I 
don&#39;t think it&#39;s dangerous or anything, Sailor Moon, so you can stop 
running!&quot; she yelled. 

&quot;Like she&#39;s gonna listen,&quot; Jupiter growled as she ran. Her tiara was 
activated and charging with static electricity, but she couldn&#39;t get a 
clear shot at the creature. &quot;C&#39;mon, meatball head, hold still!&quot; 

Sailor Venus didn&#39;t bother wasting her breath as she ran. Most of her 
attention was concentrated on her Venus Crescent Beam, which was fully 
charged and gathered together in an incandescent ball at her 
fingertips. Like Jupiter, she was also trying to get a clear shot, but 
was unable to due to Sailor Moon&#39;s erratic movements. 

&quot;You guys could help, you know....&quot; Mars said as they ran past Tolaris 
and Tuxedo Mask yet again. 

&quot;I&#39;d rather watch the five of you make fools of yourselves,&quot; Tuxedo 
Mask called out with a smile. 

&quot;Who&#39;s side are you on?!&quot; Jupiter shot back. 

Mercury blinked as an idea occurred to her. &quot;I&#39;ve got it!&quot; she said as 
she braked. Jupiter stumbled to avoid hitting her and wound up bumping 
into Sailor Venus. The contact discharged her tiara, mildly shocking 
them both and breaking Venus&#39;s concentration. 

The Crescent Beam lashed out, narrowly missing Mars and cutting a path 
through the forest. Jupiter turned her head to follow the beam and 
froze for a few moments before shaking her head and getting to her 
feet. 

&quot;Mercury, you idiot!&quot; Sailor Mars snapped as she continued to pursue 
the panicked Sailor Moon, &quot;You don&#39;t stop suddenly when we&#39;re in the 
middle of....&quot; She trailed off when she realized that Mercury had gone 
vampiric and that it was not a wise idea to cuss out a vampire. 

The vampire ignored her and concentrated on the running figure. 
&quot;Sailor Moon, look over here!&quot; she called out. The blonde glanced in 
her direction and an eerie glint appeared in Mercury&#39;s steel-blue 
eyes. At once Sailor Moon stopped running and stood still, a slightly 
vacant look in her eyes. 

As soon as she had stopped, the rakketh let go of her hair and ran as 
fast as its many legs would allow it. Not caring where it went as long 
as it got away, it ran towards the still-running figure of Sailor 
Mars. Mars saw the creature charging her and changed directions, not 
realizing that there was a small but tough tree in the way. 

Sailor Venus winced as she watched Sailor Mars rebound off the tree 
and collapse. She ran over to her inert friend, keeping a wary eye on 
both Mercury and the fleeing rakketh. &quot;You okay?&quot; she said to Mars as 
she knelt down. 

&quot;That.... that hurt....&quot; Mars said, not bothering to open her eyes. 

&quot;If you were watching where you were going, you wouldn&#39;t have bashed 
into that tree like that,&quot; Venus said softly as she glanced over at 
Sailor Moon. 

Sailor Moon was slowly walking towards Sailor Mercury, her gaze still 
rather vacant. Mercury reached out to touch her, but the blonde&#39;s 
tiara began to glow and the vampire quickly shied away. Sailor Moon 
blinked and her mind returned to the present, wondering what was going 
on. 

&quot;Mercury, what did you do to me?&quot; she asked, still puzzled. 

&quot;I hypnotized you to get you to hold still. The creature ran off as 
soon as you stopped and everything&#39;s okay now,&quot; the vampire said, her 
voice oddly distant. 

Jupiter snorted as she leaned against a tree, still dazed from the 
shock. &quot;Well, I&#39;m not okay. That static discharge gave me a headache 
and I think my ears are still ringing. You okay, Venus?&quot; 

Venus nodded. &quot;I am, but Mars slammed into a tree trying to avoid that 
hairy thing. I think she&#39;s okay, she just needs a few minutes to walk 
off the shock.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t make me get up and move around. please don&#39;t,&quot; Mars mumbled 
from her prone position. &quot;Lying here on this grass feels rather nice, 
thank you.&quot; 

Tolaris sighed heavily. &quot;Wonderful. We&#39;re not here for three hours and 
already we&#39;ve had major problems with a minor pest. Are you sure you 
five are the ones who defeated Queen Beryl?&quot; 

As one, the five Sailor Scouts turned towards the Dragoon and glared 
at him. &quot;Listen, buster,&quot; Sailor Moon started to say, but was 
interrupted when three columns of light coalesced at the end of the 
small clearing. The forms had barely solidified before a warning cry 
arose across the clearing. 

&quot;LOOK OUT!! SAILOR SCOUTS!!&quot; 

Instantly everyone dove for cover behind the nearest tree. Jupiter&#39;s 
head seemed to feel fine and Mars suddenly no longer felt the desire 
to lay down on the grass. Tuxedo Mask looked around for a brief moment 
before jumping up into a low-lying tree branch and climbing higher. 

&quot;Great, just p&#39;tahk&#39;enn great,&quot; Tolaris cursed as he flattened himself 
against a tree trunk. He blinked in surprise as a slew of neon-red 
projectiles shot across the clearing and started imbedding into 
objects. 

A projectile smacked into the tree next to the Dragoon and he gasped 
as he recognized it. Only one person I know of could throw that sort 
of thing, he thought. His train of thought was interrupted by the 
sight of Sailor Venus taking aim with her Crescent Beam. 

&quot;Venus Crescent Beam....&quot; she intoned as the two beams merged together 
at her fingertips. 

&quot;Venus, wait a second! I know one of them!&quot; Tolaris yelled out. 
&quot;Sailor Scouts, hold your fire! Let me talk with them first!&quot; Venus 
shot him a dark look and refrained from firing, but she still kept her 
Crescent Beams charged. Tolaris waited until another wave of glowing 
projectiles shot past him before he stuck his head out around the tree 
and yelled across the clearing. 

&quot;Maze! Hold your fire! It&#39;s me, Tolaris!&quot; 

He was greeted with a derisive snort of laughter and another wave of 
neon projectiles. &quot;What kind of fool do you take me for? Tolaris is 
frozen forever in the wastelands!&quot; said a voice that was quite 
familiar to Tolaris. 

A projectile shot by Tolaris and he could feel the hissing of the air 
as it passed. &quot;By Raijen, Maze, if you don&#39;t stop shooting at me, I 
swear I&#39;ll find Lieutenant Ra&#39;vel and tell her who dumped soap in her 
oil bath last year!&quot; he yelled across the clearing. 

To his surprise, the rain of projectiles ceased. He swore he could 
hear a soft chirping sound before he heard, &quot;Boss? That really you?&quot; 
He was about to reply when a cold female voice called out, &quot;Whoever 
you are, step out into the open and do it slowly.&quot; 

Tolaris gathered his courage together and slowly moved out from behind 
the tree. &quot;Nice to see you too, Whisper,&quot; he said as the three figures 
came into view. &quot;Tell me, do you always greet old friends like this?&quot; 

&quot;Real funny,&quot; said the figure with long, pale green hair. &quot;Now you and 
your Sailor Scout friends surrender or be destroyed.&quot; 

Tolaris drew himself to his full height. &quot;I am Dragoon Commander 
Tolaris, and a Dragoon never surrenders. The Sailor Scouts are my 
allies and are merely accompanying me to retrieve some personal 
effects. We intend no harm and only wish to go about in peace. If you 
don&#39;t believe me, Lieutenant Whisper, then try to read my mind.&quot; 

The second figure stepped forward and hissed, her feathers ruffling in 
uncertainty and surprise. She looked closely at Tolaris and started to 
shake. Whisper frowned and glanced at her trembling companion. &quot;Are 
you sure about that, Ra&#39;vel?&quot; 

The avian telepathed a response and shrank back from Tolaris. 
&quot;Lieutenant Ra&#39;vel here says you&#39;re psi-mute, so I can&#39;t read your 
mind. It is consistent with Commander Tolaris&#39;s mind, but I&#39;m not 
convinced you are he, despite your uniform and attitude,&quot; she said 
with scorn. 

Maze stepped forward and gestured. &quot;Commander Tolaris was the only 
person aside from me who knew about the soap incident, Captain,&quot; he 
said, giving the avian a weak smile. &quot;However, there is a more 
definitive test to his identity. Tolaris could control the weather, a 
talent shared by only four denizens. They are all accounted for, 
except for Tolaris who is still frozen in crystal.&quot; 

Ra&#39;vel chirped quietly and both Maze and Whisper blinked. &quot;She did 
what?&quot; Maze said, his eyes wide with shock. A crack of thunder drew 
their attention towards the figure in the clearing. 

Lightning bolts arced between his hands and he was surrounded by a 
wall of miniature tornadoes. A great gust of wind swept through the 
clearing, followed by a short deluge of rain and an even shorter 
heatwave. &quot;Have I made my point yet or do you want it to snow?&quot; 
Tolaris asked mildly amidst the apparent chaos of the weather. 

Whisper frowned as severe doubts plagued her resolve. Could this 
really be him? she thought. She sent a private telepath towards 
Tolaris, knowing that the nature of the thought would severely rattle 
anyone who heard it. 

Ra&#39;vel gave Whisper a puzzled look as she sensed the telepathic 
attempt. &lt;Psi-mute/mind-blind being is, Captain. Ra&#39;vel definitive 
test know.&gt; she broadcasted. &lt;Maze required translation/vocalization. 
What Ra&#39;vel say Tolaris when tornado-blast feathers lost?&gt; 

Lieutenant Maze nodded in understanding. &quot;Ra&#39;vel wants to know what 
she told you when your tornado accidentally blew off her feathers,&quot; he 
said to Tolaris. 

The Dragoon nodded slowly. &quot;To be honest, Maze, I couldn&#39;t quite make 
out what she chirped at me, but I could tell it was a suggestion to do 
something about her feathers and fast.&quot; 

Maze blinked as Ra&#39;vel suddenly ran past him and darted towards 
Tolaris. The Dragoon commander barely had time to blink in surprise 
before Ra&#39;vel had wrapped him in a bear hug and was chirping away 
quite rapidly in her native dialect. 

&quot;I&#39;d say Ra&#39;vel is convinced of his identity, as am I,&quot; Maze said with 
a smile. 

&quot;Perhaps....&quot; the telepath said doubtfully. 

&quot;Nice to see you too, Lieutenant,&quot; Tolaris said as he struggled to 
breathe properly. &quot;However, I won&#39;t be around much longer if you don&#39;t 
let me try to breathe.&quot; 

Ra&#39;vel chirped an apology and let him go. She glanced over his 
shoulder and hissed when she saw the partially concealed form of 
Sailor Mercury. &lt;Still standoff Sailor Scouts!&gt; she broadcasted as she 
started to step back. 

Tolaris grabbed her wrist. &quot;Ra&#39;vel, listen to me. The Sailor Scouts 
are my friends and allies. They will not hurt you. All we want is to 
retrieve my personal effects and my crystal collection. As soon as we 
get those, we&#39;ll go back to Earth and stay there.&quot; 

&quot;How are we supposed to trust them after they killed Queen Beryl and 
four thousand other denizens?&quot; Whisper said coldly. 

Tolaris frowned. &quot;Do you doubt my word of honor, Lieutenant?&quot; 

Maze coughed lightly. &quot;Uh, boss, she&#39;s now the captain of the 
Psi-Corp.&quot; 

Tolaris nearly fell over in shock. &quot;You made captain already? How?&quot; he 
said incrediously. 

Whisper&#39;s cold laugh sent chills down everyone&#39;s spine. &quot;It&#39;s easy 
when over ninety percent of the Psi-Corp gets killed and you&#39;re the 
highest-ranking officer still left.&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; Tolaris said. &quot;There were three thousand denizens enlisted in 
the Corp.... What happened?&quot; 

&quot;They happened,&quot; Whisper snapped, pointing an accusing finger at the 
still hidden Sailor Scouts. &quot;The Psi-Corp was gathering together in 
headquarters for a routine meeting when they shot up the complex&#39;s 
fusion reactor. Those who weren&#39;t killed outright by the resulting 
radiation were incinerated when the reactor blew out. We won&#39;t even be 
able to retrieve the remains for another three hundred years because 
of the radiation.&quot; 

Tolaris was stunned beyond words. Whisper looked into his gray eyes 
and saw the intensity of the emotion in them. In that instant, she was 
convinced without a doubt that he really was who he claimed to be. She 
frowned inside when she realized that she still trusted his word of 
honor and that meant that the Sailor Scouts really didn&#39;t intend to do 
any more damage. 

&quot;It is you, Commander....&quot; she said quietly. 

The Dragoon commander smiled. &quot;Why would I lie about that?&quot; The smile 
fell from his face as he turned his attention back to the situation at 
hand. &quot;Captain, we need to get this resolved and soon. Do you doubt my 
word of honor when I say that the Sailor Scouts will not harm you?&quot; 

Whisper frowned. &quot;No, I don&#39;t.&quot; 

Tolaris nodded. &quot;Then come with us. I want to get this taken care of 
as fast as possible, and with your help we can do this even faster.&quot; 

Whisper&#39;s pale green eyes betrayed no emotions as she fought a fierce 
internal battle. In the end, her loyalty won over her sense of duty 
and she nodded slowly. &quot;Very well, Commander, but don&#39;t think I&#39;ve 
forgiven them for what they&#39;ve done.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you, Whisper.&quot; Tolaris turned towards Maze and Ra&#39;vel. &quot;Do 
either of you want to join us as well? I understand if you can&#39;t or 
won&#39;t....&quot; 

Maze smiled. &quot;You can still count on me, boss.&quot; Ra&#39;vel chirped quietly 
and nodded slowly in agreement. 

Tolaris breathed a quiet sigh of relief and nodded back. &quot;I&#39;ve really 
missed having you three on my side and I&#39;m glad to have you back.&quot; He 
turned around and called out to the Sailor Scouts. &quot;You can come out 
now, they&#39;re friends of mine and have agreed to join us.&quot; 

One by one, the Sailor Scouts slowly emerged from their hiding places 
and stepped into the clearing. With surprising silence, Tuxedo Mask 
dropped out of the tree and landed on the ground, rose in hand and 
ready for anything. The Dragoon commander frowned when he saw that 
Sailor Jupiter&#39;s tiara was still activated and charged with energy. 

Maze whistled softly and leaned towards Tolaris. &quot;Hey, boss, who&#39;s the 
blonde in orange? She&#39;s a real looker....&quot; he said very quietly. 

Tolaris gave his friend a bemused look. &quot;At ease, Lieutenant. She&#39;s 
only fifteen and under my protection. Touch her in the wrong way and I 
would feel compelled to injure you,&quot; he said, just as quietly. 

Maze blinked at the mention of her age. &quot;Uh huh.... What about if she 
consents?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m surprised at you, Maze. First you throw your projectiles at her, 
and now you want to take her to your bed?&quot; 

&quot;Hey, who said anything about taking her to bed?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ve known you since you were seventy, Maze. Why else would you be 
that interested in a female?&quot; Tolaris grinned to himself as Maze 
flushed a dark tan color. He cleared his throat and addressed the 
Sailor Scouts. 

&quot;Sailor Scouts, may I present Dragoon Lieutenant Maze, Dragoon 
Lieutenant Ra&#39;vel, and Psi-Corp Captain Whisper,&quot; he said, gesturing 
to each in turn. 

Jupiter heard an odd noise and glanced behind her. She blinked in 
surprise as Venus blushed slightly and smiled softly at the mention of 
Maze&#39;s name. &quot;Down, girl,&quot; Jupiter said quietly and suppressed a smile 
as Venus&#39;s blush darkened considerably. 

&quot;Captain, I would like to introduce Sailor Moon, Sailor Mercury, 
Sailor Mars, Sailor Jupiter, Sailor Venus, and Tuxedo Mask,&quot; Tolaris 
continued, again gesturing to each in turn. 

&quot;Tuxedo Mask, better known as Prince Darian of Earth,&quot; Whisper said 
coldly with a formal bow. &quot;We&#39;ve met before during his brief stay in 
the Negaverse. Though I doubt he remembers me. I was part of the group 
that helped erase his memories.&quot; 

Tuxedo Mask grimaced at the mention of his brainwashing by Queen 
Beryl. &quot;I am sorry to say that I don&#39;t remember you, Captain, and I 
hope you will forgive me if I wasn&#39;t too impressed with your 
handiwork.&quot; 

Whisper opened her mouth to reply but was cut off by the crackling 
sound of energy. Tolaris glanced over at Sailor Jupiter&#39;s tiara and 
sighed heavily. &quot;Miss Jupiter, I assure you no one is going to harm 
you, so would you please turn that thing off?&quot; 

Jupiter blinked in surprise. &quot;I thought I did.&quot; She concentrated on 
her tiara and frowned. &quot;Ummm, I think it overcharged somehow and I 
can&#39;t disperse it so I&#39;ll need to discharge it the normal way. Just 
make sure no one thinks I&#39;m firing at anyone.&quot; 

Ra&#39;vel chirped and telepathed towards Jupiter. &lt;Message understood.&gt; 

Sailor Jupiter&#39;s eyes went wide as she heard the voice speaking inside 
her mind. &quot;How&#39;d you do that?&quot; she said incrediously. 

Mercury held out her computer and scanned Jupiter&#39;s tiara. &quot;Worry 
about that later. I don&#39;t like the readings I&#39;m getting from your 
tiara.&quot; 

Jupiter nodded. &quot;Gotcha.&quot; She crossed her arms in front of her with 
her pointer fingers extended. &quot;Jupiter Thunder....&quot; she started to 
say. 

A bolt of lightning formed in the cloudless sky and darted down to her 
overcharged tiara. The tiara&#39;s lightning rod overloaded and sent the 
energy shooting back along the lightning bolt. Instead of dispersing, 
the new energy merged with the old and condensed into a physical form. 

Jupiter&#39;s green eyes became even wider than before as new power 
surrounded her body. She found that she could control the new energy 
form as if it were part of her own body. A name rose up from deep 
within her mind and escaped past her lips before she realized what she 
said. 

&quot;Thunder Dragon....&quot; she whispered. 

Then as quickly as it had come, the energy dispersed completely and 
the lightning rod folded back down into her tiara. No one moved for a 
few seconds, stunned by what they had just witnessed. 

&quot;Well....&quot; Jupiter said slowly, &quot;I guess the new improvements Luna and 
Artemis made works....&quot; She was about to say more when pain like she 
had never felt before lanced through her head. She fell to her knees 
and screamed as an unseen force tore at her mind. 

&quot;You&#39;re the one!&quot; Whisper hissed as her mind lashed out. &quot;You&#39;re the 
one who killed my husband!&quot; She gritted her teeth and renewed her 
mental attack, determined to exact vengeance. 

Tolaris ran over to her and grabbed her head with one hand while 
holding his other hand inches away from her face. A powerful bolt of 
lightning arced between his fingers and got Whisper&#39;s attention. She 
halted her mental attack and Jupiter collapsed, whimpering softly to 
herself. 

&quot;Listen to me, Whisper,&quot; Tolaris said darkly. &quot;Do you remember what 
went on at the Battle of Mintaka?&quot; 

&quot;I still have nightmares about that and Ra&#39;vel still has the mental 
scars from that,&quot; Whisper said almost inaudibly. The torrent of 
emotions inside her mind paralyzed her enough for Tolaris to keep her 
attention focused on him and not on Jupiter. 

&quot;Remember how I ran a lightning bolt though that telepath&#39;s brain to 
save you and Ra&#39;vel? I will do the same to you if you so much as 
consider attacking the Sailor Scouts again. They are under my 
protection and more importantly, they are my friends, just like you 
and Ra&#39;vel were at Mintaka,&quot; he said in a tone that Whisper rarely 
heard from him. 

&quot;Tolaris, she&#39;s the one. She killed my husband....&quot; she said as tears 
started to form in her eyes. &quot;Orestan was killed by a blast of 
lightning after his batallion was attacked by the Sailor Scouts.... 
She must pay....&quot; 

&quot;Captain, you must listen to me. Nothing you can do will bring him 
back, and attacking the Sailor Scouts will accomplish nothing. Do you 
have absolute undeniable proof that it was Jupiter who killed him? Are 
you sure he wasn&#39;t electrocuted by something or accidentally blasted 
by someone else?&quot; Tolaris said in a softer tone. 

Whisper closed her eyes. &quot;No.... no, I don&#39;t....&quot; 

&quot;Then you must not do anything until you are sure, Captain. If you 
feel that you can&#39;t join with us, I understand. But please, give them 
the chance to prove themselves trustworthy. You gave me that chance 
six hundred years ago when I wanted to go with you on the that first 
trip to the Outreaches. All I ask is to give them that chance now.&quot; 

She opened her eyes and glanced over towards the cluster of Sailor 
Scouts. Ra&#39;vel was kneeling next to Jupiter and carefully probing her 
mind under the watchful eyes of the other Sailor Scouts. They&#39;re 
trusting Ra&#39;vel with her mind, Whisper thought. Perhaps Tolaris is 
right.... 

&quot;Very well, Tolaris,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;But if I do find definite 
proof that she is responsible, neither you nor anyone else will be 
able to stop me from making her pay.&quot; 

&quot;Understood, Captain,&quot; Tolaris said and released his hold on her. He 
walked over to the group and looked carefully at Ra&#39;vel. &quot;Will she be 
okay?&quot; he asked, and received a short chirp in response. 

&quot;She said that your friend only suffered a light mental blast and 
should regain consciousness very soon without any damage,&quot; Maze said. 

Sailor Moon blinked. &quot;She said all that in one chirp?&quot; 

Maze shook his head. &quot;No, she just telepathed it to me. She can&#39;t do 
that with Tolaris because he&#39;s psi-mute.&quot; 

Just then, Sailor Jupiter groaned and tried to sit up. &quot;That&#39;s it, 
White Russians are definitely off my drink list.... Ooh, my head....&quot; 
she muttered to herself. 

Venus blinked and frowned. &quot;White Russians? Girl, have you been 
drinking alcohol?&quot; 

Jupiter coughed. &quot;Oops.... umm.... No, why do you ask?&quot; she said in 
her best innocent voice. 

&quot;Leda....&quot; Venus said dangerously. She blinked as someone laid a hand 
on her shoulder. She looked up and found Maze standing next to her. 

&quot;Perhaps you should let your friend recuperate first before you chew 
her out,&quot; he suggested. 

The blonde blushed at his closeness. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; she said with a smile. 

Tolaris laughed to himself as he noticed the exchange between Sailor 
Venus and Maze. Why do I suddenly get the feeling that Maze will wake 
up one morning and not have a clue as to what hit him? he thought to 
himself. He cleared his throat and addressed the group. 

&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, may I remind you that we are on a rather tight 
schedule and need to get this mission taken care of as soon as 
possible? Just as soon Ra&#39;vel is sure that Miss Jupiter will be fine, 
we&#39;ll have to keep on moving. Understood?&quot; 

Everyone nodded and Sailor Moon made a face. &quot;Just as long as we don&#39;t 
run into any more hairy things. I&#39;ve had enough for one lifetime as it 
is.&quot; 

Mars laughed. &quot;Well if you would have just stood still, we could have 
gotten rid of it a lot faster, meatball head.&quot; 

&quot;At least I wasn&#39;t dumb enough to run into a tree,&quot; Sailor Moon 
retorted. 

&quot;Oh, yeah...?&quot; 

Tolaris sighed and let his head bump into a tree. This is going to be 
a very, very long day, he thought to himself as the argument raged on. 

Whisper silently moved up behind him. &quot;Are they always like this?&quot; she 
said softly. 

&quot;Occasionally. I&#39;ve learned that it&#39;s best to just stay out of it 
until you can get a definitive word in edgewise. A lightning bolt 
works just fine, but you need to have the right timing.&quot; 

&quot;Wonderful,&quot; Whisper replied. &quot;Tell you what, how about if I take a 
small nap and you wake me up when we&#39;re ready?&quot; 

At that instant, Tolaris saw his opportunity and he let loose with a 
sharp crack of thunder. As expected, the two Sailor Scouts quickly 
fell silent in surprise and looked at him. 

&quot;Shall we go, ladies?&quot; the Dragoon said with a smile. 

&quot;You enjoy doing that, don&#39;t you?&quot; Tuxedo Mask said as they quickly 
got ready to resume their march. 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;Got to keep entertained somehow on this trip,&quot; he 
said as he started walking down the path. The rest of the group made 
sure they had everything and fell in step behind him. Together, the 
Sailor Scouts and their newly made allies left the clearing and 
entered the forest, intent on finishing their mission. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The dark figure continued to watch over the Sailor Scouts, following 
their every movement. He became slightly concerned when they ran into 
the group of denizens, but things worked out to his relief. His only 
moment of panic came when the green Sailor Scout came under mental 
attack, but things were quickly taken care of and he relaxed. 

After they left the clearing, he stopped at the spot where she had 
fallen unconscious. He carefully sniffed around for blood or signs of 
sickness but was unable to find anything except for the smell of her 
fear, perfectly normal for coming under telepathic attack. 

Then she is still fine, he thought. Good. I would not have liked to 
have seen her hurt. He paused for another moment and repeated the word 
he overheard that helped define his unexpected interest in the Sailor 
Scouts. Then before anything or anyone could identify the source of 
the sound, he silently resumed his trailing of the small group and 
disappeared from sight. 

Behind him, the softly-spoken word seemed to carry on the wind 
forever. 

&quot;Leda....&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

They walked quickly but carefully through the forest and towards the 
small stone valley that marked the outside edge of the Dragoon complex 
perimeter. Sailor Mars and Sailor Mercury were at the front, the 
former keeping a careful eye out for anything while the latter scanned 
the area with her computer. They were followed closely by Sailor Moon, 
who was still slightly upset about the incident with the rakketh. 

Behind them were Sailor Venus and Sailor Jupiter, also keeping a wary 
eye out for trouble. Not far behind them, Maze was quietly filling 
Tolaris in on what happened after he was frozen in crystal. Whisper 
was following closely behind Maze while Ra&#39;vel and Tuxedo Mask kept 
alert as the rear guard. 

&quot;You okay, Jupiter?&quot; 

Jupiter blinked as Venus&#39;s soft question startled her. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; 
she said quietly. She glanced over at her companion and frowned as she 
received a concerned and curious look. 

&quot;I&#39;m just asking if you&#39;re okay. You look like you&#39;ve seen a ghost or 
something.&quot; 

Jupiter snorted. &quot;Well, almost having your face taken off by a stray 
shot will rattle anyone. You&#39;re the one we should be worried about, 
after you got that shock and all.&quot; 

Venus giggled. &quot;Well, if you didn&#39;t shock me like that, I wouldn&#39;t 
have lost my concentration and fired.&quot; 

An odd smile crept across the brunette&#39;s face. &quot;Mmm, speaking of lost 
concentration, have you finished drooling over Tolaris&#39;s friend yet?&quot; 
She laughed softly as Venus blushed and her gaze fell to the ground. 

&quot;Well.... he is rather handsome....&quot; 

&quot;And probably just as old as Tolaris is, no doubt.&quot; 

Venus shrugged and smiled. &quot;So? If Ami can fall in love with someone 
who&#39;s over seven hundred, what does age matter? Well, relative age, at 
least. He looks like he&#39;s in his late twenties.&quot; 

&quot;Looks can be deceiving,&quot; Jupiter reminded her. &quot;If I understood what 
Tolaris was saying, a twenty-year-old denizen would still be a 
toddler.&quot; 

The blonde blinked. &quot;When did you learn this?&quot; 

&quot;Over breakfast this morning.&quot; Jupiter frowned as she tried to 
remember a few details. &quot;Was it this morning? Seems like a while 
ago....&quot; 

Venus nodded. &quot;I know what you mean.&quot; 

Jupiter shrugged. &quot;No matter. Anyway, you going to ask Maze out for a 
date when this is over or what?&quot; 

Sailor Venus blushed a deep shade of crimson. &quot;Leda!&quot; she said, highly 
embarrassed. 

&quot;Trust me, girl, I know that look. I see it in Ami&#39;s eyes when she 
smiles at Tolaris for no real reason other than because she loves 
him.&quot; 

Venus gave her a strange look. &quot;So what are you saying?&quot; 

&quot;Nothing much, really, but I&#39;ll bet that if we locked you two together 
in a small room for a few hours, you would spend most of your time 
getting to know each other in several different ways.&quot; She blinked as 
she realized that her words could be taken the wrong way. 
&quot;Conversationally, that is,&quot; she amended hastily. 

Venus nodded, a soft smile on her lips. &quot;Perhaps. To be honest, I 
think I could handle being locked in a room with him.&quot; 

&quot;I would say that the feeling is mutual,&quot; said a soft voice behind 
her. 

Both Jupiter and Venus turned around to find Maze standing behind 
them. He smiled and nodded towards Venus and she immediately blushed 
again. &quot;Forgive my boldness, ladies, but I believe your philosophers 
are wrong about a few things. They say that the best shall come to 
those who wait, but more often than not the best won&#39;t wait because 
someone else got there first.&quot; 

Jupiter snickered while Venus continued to blush and could only nod in 
silent agreement. &quot;That&#39;s one of the better interpretations I&#39;ve heard 
in a long time. Want me to arrange a private room for you two at a 
later date?&quot; she said, ignoring the strangled sounds coming from 
Sailor Venus. 

Maze nodded. &quot;If you can do it without too much trouble, yes.&quot; 

Jupiter nodded once before her expression darkened slightly. &quot;Just 
keep in mind that if you so much as think of touching her in the wrong 
way, I&#39;m going to feed you to my new Thunder Dragon. Understand?&quot; 

Maze nodded. &quot;Perfectly.&quot; He glanced over at Sailor Venus and blinked 
in surprise. &quot;Doesn&#39;t that hurt?&quot; 

Jupiter looked at the blonde and smirked. &quot;What, the eyes the size of 
tennis balls, the jaw hanging down to her knees, or the bright red 
color on her cheeks?&quot; She shook her head and laughed. &quot;C&#39;mon, Venus, 
get it together and stop looking like you&#39;re going to have a heart 
attack.&quot; 

Any further conversation was interrupted by the sound of Ra&#39;vel 
screeching almost in the ultrasound range. She continued to screech 
for a few seconds before she composed herself long enough to telepath 
something to Whisper. The captain&#39;s eyes went wide with pure horror as 
she realized something. 

&quot;Maze, we forgot the cataport!&quot; she yelled. &quot;We&#39;re standing right in 
the v&#39;tek&#39;ka line of fire and Ra&#39;vel just felt a teleport!&quot; 

The Dragoon lieutenant immediately started in on a complex string of 
cuss words. He reflexively glanced up and blinked as a small object 
shimmered into existence high above the valley. &quot;INCOMING!!&quot; he 
screamed. &quot;HIT THE DIRT!!&quot; 

Everyone dove for cover as the object plummeted towards the group. It 
waited until it was fifty feet above the ground before it detonated in 
an ear-shattering explosion, sending several thousand tiny shards of 
extremely sharp crystal shooting through the area. 

Cries of pain filled the valley as the shards sliced across skin, 
leaving bloody lines in their wake. An immense blast of wind rose up 
vertically into the sky and managed to force the remaining shards off 
at an angle so they slammed into the edges of the valley rather than 
into the group. The attack only lasted a moment, leaving everyone 
stunned and injured in varying degrees. 

The shock and surprise only lasted a second before another set of 
warnings arose. Tolaris turned around to find Jupiter doing her best 
to keep a very upset and vampiric Mercury still long enough for Sailor 
Venus to yank out the crystal shard imbedded in her abdomen. 

Every time Venus managed to get a grip on the shard, Mercury would 
twist and writhe about and the shard would slide out of the blonde&#39;s 
grasp. Venus sighed in resignation and brought her foot down on top of 
the blue boot in her way. Mercury stiffened in pain, freezing long 
enough for Venus to grasp the shard and yank it out. The blonde hissed 
slightly as the sharp edges of the crystal sliced into her glove, 
cutting the skin and drawing a fair amount of blood. 

Both Venus and Jupiter stepped back as Mercury fell to her knees and 
did her best to curl up into a tiny ball. Venus let the bloody shard 
fall from her grasp and looked at her hand, hoping it would heal 
without any scarring. She blinked as Jupiter started to stagger, the 
side of her blouse stained a dark red. &quot;Jupiter....&quot; she started to 
say. 

Jupiter waved her off. &quot;Save it, most of it is from her,&quot; she said 
with a gesture towards Mercury. 

&quot;Sound off, damage report,&quot; Tolaris said between clenched teeth. His 
arm was dripping gray blood and he had a nasty cut across one cheek. 

Maze coughed. &quot;Lieutenant Maze, got a leg and arm slashed up. Nothing 
serious, but I&#39;ll take some medical gauze if you got it,&quot; he said, 
holding up his arm and showing the dark green gash. 

&quot;Sailor Jupiter, my side hurts like hell and I&#39;m going to need a 
serious band-aid for my leg, but I&#39;m still alive.&quot; 

&quot;Sailor Venus, got a bad cut on my hand and a minor one on my 
shoulder, but that&#39;s it.&quot; She knelt down beside Mercury and checked 
her over, keeping an eye out for any sudden moves she might make. 
&quot;Mercury took a shard in her stomach, but it&#39;s out now and I think the 
wound is almost closed. It looks like her leg got sliced as well, but 
her regeneration seems to be working fine. The only real problem is 
the amount of blood she lost.&quot; 

Tolaris grunted. &quot;Just keep an eye on her.&quot; 

Venus nodded. &quot;No problem.&quot; 

Tuxedo Mask made a low moaning sound as he bent over Sailor Moon. 
&quot;Tuxedo Mask, I&#39;ve just small cuts, but there are a lot of them and 
I&#39;m in some very serious pain. Sailor Moon&#39;s arm and shoulder are cut, 
but not badly. However, she&#39;s unconscious and I think it&#39;s because of 
the slash in her leg. It looks bad but I can tell it isn&#39;t. She 
probably passed out from the pain, though.&quot; 

&quot;Sailor Mars, got the entire back of my blouse shredded and hurting. 
Got the cut on my face slashed open, too. Just after it had started to 
heal,&quot; she grumbled. 

&quot;Captain Whisper, my back is a mess but I&#39;ll live. Tolaris, we need to 
get Ra&#39;vel to a medic and soon. She&#39;s got several shards imbedded in 
her wings and I think she&#39;s got one lodged in a lung. The only thing 
is that if I do a teleport with her, the energy required will be 
detectable any telepath worth her skills.&quot; 

Tolaris looked over at her. Her back was indeed a mess and covered 
with her dark green blood. She was holding Ra&#39;vel up with one arm 
while using the other hand to create a mindlink to the avian. Tolaris 
figured the mindlink was to keep the pain of Ra&#39;vel&#39;s injuries from 
overwhelming her. The avian&#39;s black blood was splattered over the 
entire area surrounding her, a sight which caused Tolaris to worry. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about being detected, just get her to a healer and fast. 
We can deal with being discovered later, if we aren&#39;t already. Just 
try to report back to me with a few medical kits as soon as you can, 
Captain.&quot; 

Whisper nodded and tightened her hold on Ra&#39;vel. The two denizens 
seemed to shimmer briefly before the vanished. Tolaris turned back to 
the rest of the group, intent on looking at Mercury&#39;s injuries. He 
frowned as he heard a low rumbling sound and the ground started to 
shake slightly. 

Tuxedo Mask looked up. &quot;What&#39;s that noise?&quot; he asked, still kneeling 
next to the unconscious Sailor Moon. 

&quot;It sounds like an avalanche,&quot; Mars said. &quot;Remember that one we went 
through at the ski lodge?&quot; 

A wave of dread swept through Tolaris. He looked at Maze and saw the 
look of horror reflected in him as well. They both glanced up at the 
sides of the valley and gasped. A dust cloud was forming high up on 
one side, and that could only mean one thing. 

Tolaris and Maze started cussing in unison. &quot;It is an avalanche!&quot; 
Tolaris said. &quot;We&#39;ve got to get out of here, now!&quot; 

&quot;No time, here it comes!&quot; Jupiter screamed as a large boulder rolled 
into view and started down into the valley. 

&quot;Venus Crescent Beam SMASH!!&quot; said Venus as her Crescent Beam lashed 
out. It caught the boulder in the center and disintegrated it into a 
cloud of dust and powder. The cloud had barely settled before another 
boulder rolled into view, followed by several more. 

Again and again the Crescent Beam lashed out, striking the boulders 
and turning them into dust clouds. The clouds were quickly blown aside 
by the passage of dozens of large rocks, far too many for Venus to 
take out. Terror gripped her heart as she took aim and focused her 
energy. Something in the depths of her mind clicked and the words 
formed on her lips before she could think of saying them. 

&quot;Venus Meteor Shower....&quot; she intoned. The Crescent Beams merged 
together at her fingertips and fired. Instead of lashing out at one 
target, the Beams split apart and became several dozen beams, each one 
lashing out at a different target. The boulders disintegrated into a 
massive cloud of dust that slowly fell to the ground. 

The valley went silent, except for the sound of a single rock making 
its way down the edge of the valley. Tuxedo Mask snickered ironically 
as a rock the size of a baseball rolled to a stop a few inches away 
from Sailor Venus. &quot;You missed one,&quot; he said with a grin. 

&quot;Oops,&quot; she said in an odd tone. 

Sailor Jupiter shook her head in wonder. &quot;So that was your new power. 
I kind of like it, especially since it saved us from a bad case of 
boulder rash.&quot; She blinked and looked closer at Venus. &quot;You okay, 
girl?&quot; 

&quot;Slight headache, that&#39;s all,&quot; Venus replied distantly. She felt a 
gentle touch on her uninjured shoulder and knew that Maze was behind 
her. 

&quot;That was highly impressive, Miss Venus,&quot; the Dragoon said softly. 

&quot;It was, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; she replied and passed out into his arms. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Sailor Venus awoke to the sensation of a cool, damp cloth being laid 
over her forehead. She groaned slightly as the feeling of pain in her 
hand and shoulder returned. She took a deep breath and tried to sit 
up, only to have a hand gently push her back down. 

&quot;Easy, Venus,&quot; she heard Maze say in soft tones. &quot;Just wait a few 
minutes before you try to sit up.&quot; 

She tried to open her eyes but the cloth&#39;s weight pressing on her 
eyelids made it difficult. She flexed her hands experimentally and 
discovered that she wasn&#39;t wearing her gloves anymore. She continued 
to flex various muscles and discovered that not only were her shoes 
removed, but the top two buttons of her blouse were opened and the 
fabric pulled aside at her injured shoulder. She couldn&#39;t tell because 
of the cloth, but she was willing to bet that her tiara was also 
somewhere else. 

&quot;So how are you feeling, Venus?&quot; Maze asked. 

&quot;Like I&#39;ve been used as a punching bag. What happened?&quot; she replied, 
her voice dry and rough. 

&quot;According to Sailor Mercury&#39;s computer, that new power used a lot of 
your energy and you passed out. Here, drink this,&quot; he said and she 
felt a cup at her lips. 

She took a drink and the cool water helped her throat immensely. &quot;Mmm, 
thank you, Lieutenant,&quot; she said with a slight smile. 

He chuckled quietly. &quot;Please, call me Maze,&quot; he said softly and she 
felt his hand brush against her cheek. &quot;After all, if we&#39;re to be 
locked in a small room together, we might as well drop the 
formalities, Miss Venus.&quot; 

Venus felt the heat rising in her face as she blushed a dark shade of 
red. &quot;Call me Mina, if we&#39;re to drop the formalities,&quot; she managed to 
say without stuttering. 

&quot;Mina....&quot; he repeated softly. &quot;A lovely name befitting a lovely young 
girl,&quot; he said as he removed the cloth from her forehead and laid it 
over her injured shoulder. He watched as her eyes opened and quickly 
focused on her surroundings. She glanced up at him and her blush 
deepened by two shades. 

&quot;If I didn&#39;t know better, Maze, I&#39;d say you were trying to charm me,&quot; 
she said with a soft smile. She noticed that his short, spiky purple 
hair seemed to go well with his tan eyes in a strange sort of way. 

&quot;Is it working?&quot; he said with a smile of his own. 

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; she admitted. 

Maze laughed quietly, a deep and resonant sound that sent a strange 
thrill down Venus&#39;s spine. &quot;It looks like I&#39;ll just have to test how 
well,&quot; he said as he ran his fingertips along her jawline. Then before 
she could reply, he bent down and lightly kissed her. 

The move caught her by surprise and her mind froze, not sure how to 
handle the situation. With her higher mental functions frozen, her 
body defaulted to her instincts and she kissed him back. The kiss only 
lasted for a brief moment before they broke apart and looked into each 
other&#39;s eyes. 

&quot;I see you two are feeling better,&quot; said a mildly amused voice. 

They both blinked in surprise and looked up to find Sailor Mercury 
looking down at them with a knowing smile on her face. Her right boot 
was slashed in two places and her blouse had a small hole where the 
shard had pierced it, but she appeared to be completely uninjured. 

Venus blushed again and glanced at Maze. She was surprised to see that 
his face had lost most of its color and he appeared to be suddenly 
nervous. 

If Mercury noticed the change in his behavior, she ignored it. She 
held her computer towards Venus&#39;s shoulder and scanned the injury. 
&quot;Well, it looks like all you&#39;ve got is a minor cut on your shoulder 
and a nasty cut on your palm. They both look like they&#39;ll heal 
normally without any sort of problems. However, your energy reserves 
are low from your use of your new power, so you should take it easy 
for awhile.&quot; 

She turned her computer towards Maze and scanned his bandaged arm. She 
blinked in confusion as he shied away from her. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; 

Maze sighed quietly. &quot;Forgive my bluntness, Miss Mercury, but what are 
you? I saw how badly you were injured, and yet you now stand in front 
of me without any trace of injury at all. According to our reports, no 
human being should be able to regenerate those kinds of wounds that 
fast.&quot; 

Mercury slowly knelt down next to Venus as her expression changed from 
a calm person to that of a person ready to cry. &quot;If you really want to 
know, Lieutenant, I&#39;ll tell you,&quot; she said softly. 

Venus reached up and laid a comforting hand over Mercury&#39;s. &quot;Ami....&quot; 
she started to say but was waved off. 

Mercury took a deep breath and, looking into Maze&#39;s eyes, went 
vampiric. &quot;As you can see,&quot; she said, ignoring his horrified 
expression at her change, &quot;I have become.... I am a vampire. And it is 
because I am one that I am able to regenerate the wounds I received.&quot; 

Maze swallowed and nodded slowly. &quot;I remember now.... Shortly after 
the BloodMoon conjunction, a great deal of our resources were directed 
towards a project regarding the possibility of a denizen vampire on 
Earth. I was never told that it was about a Sailor Scout.&quot; He blinked 
as a memory surfaced in the depths of this mind. &quot;Mercury.... It was 
Tolaris, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, it was,&quot; she replied softly. She gave him a brief explanation of 
how it happened while she scanned the wound on his leg. She finished 
the scan and frowned lightly. &quot;There appears to be a residual 
infection in the injury. All that really needs to be done is to rinse 
it out with the iodine-peroxide solution and redressed.&quot; 

Venus smiled. &quot;I can handle that while you check out the others.&quot; 

Mercury blinked in mild surprise, the corners of her mouth forming 
into a smile. &quot;Are you sure about that?&quot; 

The blonde nodded. &quot;I may not want to be a doctor, but I know more 
than a few things about taking care of cuts and bruises. Besides,&quot; she 
added with a wicked grin, &quot;If you stick around for a few more minutes, 
I&#39;d make you talk about what else happened that night.&quot; 

The Dragoon blinked as Sailor Mercury blushed a dark red color and 
hastily excused herself to attend to the others. Venus giggled as she 
slowly sat up. She blinked as she felt a breeze across her chest and 
glanced down. Not only were the top two buttons of her blouse undone 
but her chest bow was missing as well, exposing the curves of her 
breasts. 

She felt a hand brush her hair back from her ear and heard Maze&#39;s 
voice whispering softly. &quot;Before you get upset, Sailor Mercury did 
that so she could tend to your shoulder without straining the fabric.&quot; 
He laughed softly in her ear, causing her to shiver lightly. &quot;It is 
unfortunate that you choose to hide such perfection behind something 
as useless as a decorative bow. Now if that bow of yours was a form of 
armor, I&#39;d understand, but you&#39;d still miss the opportunity to dazzle 
your opponents with your beauty.&quot; 

She blushed and looked away. She couldn&#39;t explain why, but she 
suddenly found herself wanting to feel his touch on her skin very 
badly. She closed her eyes as she felt his fingertips run along her 
jawline again. He laughed softly again and gently removed the damp 
cloth from the wound on her shoulder. &quot;We&#39;ll have to continue this.... 
conversation in another time and place, one with a proper setting,&quot; he 
whispered in her ear. &quot;In the meantime, we need to get our collective 
injuries taken care of.&quot; 

Venus opened her eyes and nodded. &quot;I&#39;d like that, Maze....&quot; she said 
very quietly as she took the cloth from him and started to unwrap the 
bandages on his leg. She glanced over at the others and blinked at the 
extent of their injuries. 

Tuxedo Mask had removed his shirt, revealing the multitude of slash 
lines across his back. He was bent over the now-conscious Sailor Moon, 
carefully tending to the jagged wound on her calf. Beside her were her 
boots, and Venus could see how badly they were torn up. 

Venus smiled as she saw Sailor Mars sitting some distance away from 
the group. She had a thermal blanket wrapped around her and was 
furiously working away at the blouse in her lap with a miniature 
sewing kit. She glanced up at Venus and waved. Venus made a show of 
tugging at her collar and Mars blushed a vivid shade of red before 
returning to her fast-paced work. 

Tolaris was sitting on the ground, leaning against a tree while he 
worked at rebandaging his arm. Even from a distance, Venus could tell 
his mind was elsewhere, working furiously on a way to solve their 
various problems without further risk to life and limb. 

Sailor Jupiter had her blouse almost up to her breasts to uncover the 
slash marks on her rib cage. She made a face as Mercury dabbed at the 
wounds with more of the iodine-peroxide solution. Venus was wondering 
where she had gotten the solution from when Captain Whisper teleported 
into the group with a medical kit under each arm. 

Ahh, so that&#39;s it, Venus thought as the last of the wrappings fell 
away from Maze&#39;s leg. She glanced at the wound and paled. The cut 
extended almost the entire length of his upper thigh. She blinked and 
peered closer at the traces of dark green blood still seeping from the 
injury. 

Maze looked at the expression on her face and smiled. &quot;Not used to 
seeing blood that isn&#39;t red, eh?&quot; 

Venus nodded and grabbed the bottle of iodine-peroxide solution. &quot;Does 
blood color have anything to do with your special powers or anything?&quot; 
she said as she started to clean the wound. 

The Dragoon grimaced in pain as the solution came into contact with 
the raw nerve endings. &quot;Not exactly. Blood color is for the most part 
a personal trait and has no bearing on the body&#39;s functions. The four 
most common colors of denizen blood are dark red, dark green, dark 
blue, and black. There are, however, a large range of blood factors 
that made blood transfusions a tricky affair at best.&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s your blood type?&quot; she asked, curious. 

&quot;G3-positive. I don&#39;t suppose that translates into your system, does 
it?&quot; 

Venus giggled. &quot;Nope.&quot; She finished cleaning out the wound and 
proceeded to rebandage it. &quot;There, this should do it.&quot; 

Maze smiled softly at her. &quot;Thank you, Mina.&quot; 

Venus blushed and glanced away shyly. She blinked in mild surprise 
when a shadow fell across her and she looked up. 

&quot;Are you two doing well?&quot; Tolaris asked with a knowing smile. 

&quot;As well as can be expected for being torn up, boss,&quot; Maze replied. 
&quot;What can we do for you?&quot; 

&quot;Whisper just came back from Medical and has brought some interesting 
news with her. There appears to be some sort of disturbance in the 
Outreaches and a large contingent of troops are being moved out there 
right now, including the majority of the Dragoons in this region. If 
we wait until morning to make our move on the complex, we shouldn&#39;t 
have to deal with very many personnel.&quot; 

Maze nodded. &quot;That&#39;s good, but how are we going to keep the Sailor 
Scouts hidden and sheltered for the night?&quot; 

Tolaris finally smiled. &quot;This is where you come in. You&#39;ll return to 
the complex and requisition some camping supplies, enough for a group 
of, oh, seven individuals.&quot; 

The purple-haired Dragoon laughed. &quot;I think I see where you&#39;re going 
with this plan, boss. Very subtle. I only see one problem, however. 
How are you going to explain to any patrols why you have six Sailor 
Scouts camping outside the Dragoon complex perimeter?&quot; 

Maze blinked in surprise as a figure stepped out from behind Tolaris. 
Ami smiled at the Dragoon&#39;s confusion. &quot;Hello, Lieutenant. Who said 
they would find Sailor Scouts?&quot; 

&quot;Who.... who are you?&quot; Maze asked. 

Ami&#39;s smile widened. &quot;My name is Ami, but I think you know me better 
as Sailor Mercury.&quot; 

Tolaris laughed as Maze&#39;s eyes became impossibly wide. &quot;You.... you&#39;re 
Sailor Mercury? But you look so.... different!&quot; Maze said, still in a 
state of high confusion and surprise. 

Ami nodded. &quot;I just reversed my transformation, that&#39;s all. I just 
look different as a Sailor Scout because that&#39;s part of the 
transformation magic.&quot; 

Maze blinked and looked at Sailor Venus. &quot;Tell me.... Do you look just 
as beautiful when you&#39;re not a Sailor Scout?&quot; 

Venus blushed and Ami smiled. She leaned over towards Maze and 
whispered conspiratially, &quot;We think she&#39;s even more stunning when 
she&#39;s wearing something more comfortable than these suits. However,&quot; 
she said, going vampiric and lowering her voice by several tones, 
&quot;Keep in mind that she is a Sailor Scout and one of our best friends. 
I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m reading you two correctly, so let me just say that 
if you even consider touching her with anything less than honorable 
intentions, I will personally drain every ounce of blood out of your 
veins. Are we clear on the matter, Lieutenant?&quot; 

Maze gulped and took a ragged breath. &quot;Clear as crystal, ma&#39;am.&quot; 

Ami smiled and stepped back, returning to her normal state. &quot;I&#39;m so 
glad to hear that, Maze.&quot; She glanced towards Venus and received a 
mildly reproving look. Ami shrugged and headed back to check up on how 
Sailor Mars was doing with the repairs to her shredded suit. 

Maze looked at the heavens and sighed, wondering what he did to 
deserve this. &quot;First you, then Jupiter, and now Mercury,&quot; he said 
quietly to Tolaris. &quot;Trust me when I say that everyone&#39;s meaning has 
been made loud and clear.&quot; 

The Dragoon commander laughed. &quot;Never hurts to make sure you 
understand, Maze. As soon as Miss Venus is finished patching your leg 
up, I&#39;d like you to start getting those camping supplies. I have no 
idea what time it is in this world anymore, but my stomach clock tells 
me it&#39;s almost time for dinner.&quot; 

&quot;Sure thing, boss.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you, Lieutenant. Oh, one more thing, if its possible. After you 
return to your quarters tonight, could you pull up a quick summary of 
what&#39;s been going on in here since my absence? Just a quick collection 
of the major articles of interest from the newsfeeds should be enough, 
unless you feel like digging any deeper.&quot; 

Maze nodded. &quot;No problem. You&#39;ll probably have to drop by to pick it 
up, however, since it might arouse suspicions if I keep coming and 
going.&quot; 

Tolaris frowned. &quot;That might not be wise. I could be recognized and 
that would definitely screw things up.&quot; 

&quot;Just wear lieutenant stripes instead of your commander&#39;s stripes. 
Trust me, if you just carry a clipboard or something and act like 
you&#39;ve got some important business to take care of, no one will pay 
much attention to you.&quot; 

Tolaris gave his friend a strange look. &quot;You sound like you&#39;ve done 
this sort of thing before.&quot; 

Maze grinned. &quot;Hey, when you&#39;ve got thirty cadets to watch over and 
you don&#39;t feel like dealing with them, you learn to make yourself as 
ordinary and undeserving of attention as possible.&quot; 

Tolaris laughed. &quot;Spoken like a true Dragoon. Anyway, I&#39;ll leave you 
two to take care of whatever business you were working on. What time 
do you want me to try to stop by?&quot; 

Maze shrugged. &quot;An hour after sundown should suffice. I don&#39;t know 
what time it is, either, so I can&#39;t give you a better clue.&quot; 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;Good enough. See you tonight, Maze.&quot; 

&quot;Take care, boss,&quot; Maze replied as Tolaris walked off. He glanced over 
at Sailor Venus and frowned lightly. &quot;You okay?&quot; 

Venus blinked and her mind returned to the present. &quot;What? Oh, yes, 
I&#39;m fine. I was just thinking....&quot; 

Maze smiled. &quot;Anything interesting?&quot; 

He blinked as Venus smiled oddly at him. &quot;Perhaps, but we&#39;ll have to 
work on determining that later. Now, let me see your arm....&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Leda stood at the edge of the clearing, watching as the dark red sun 
set on the horizon. Most of the sky had already taken on that eerie 
purple cast that she had found more than slightly discomforting the 
last time she was in the Negaverse. Night should be a dark but soft 
shade of blue, not this harsh shade of purple, she thought as the edge 
of the alien sun slid out of view. 

She turned her head a few degrees to the left, looking at the strange 
sight that had captivated her since she first saw it. In the distance, 
a small mountain loomed up into the sky, it&#39;s base shrouded in 
perpetual mists and an eternal thunderstorm raging at it&#39;s peak. She 
wished not for the first time to be on that mountain and to feel the 
power that the eternal storm unleashed. 

She caught motion out of the corner of her eye and whirled around. Her 
breath caught in her throat as she recognized her silent visitor. 
&quot;Evening, Captain,&quot; she said politely. 

Whisper looked out towards the horizon. &quot;So it is,&quot; she said with a 
slow nod of her head. &quot;You are best advised to keep alert, Jupiter. 
Your lack of awareness to my presence could have been fatal.&quot; And it 
still might be, was the unspoken message in her voice. 

Leda turned to look at the strange mountain again. &quot;Captain, when you 
attacked me earlier, I heard you yelling something but I couldn&#39;t make 
out the words. What were you saying?&quot; she asked quietly. 

&quot;That you were the one who killed my husband,&quot; was the cold but 
equally quiet reply. 

Leda&#39;s gaze darted towards Whisper, a look of shock on her face. 
&quot;What? What are you saying?&quot; 

Whisper looked out into the night, seeking something to bring peace to 
her mind. &quot;My husband was one of the denizens killed when you and the 
other Sailor Scouts fought your way back to Earth. I know he was 
killed by you because he was killed by a blast of lightning, and you 
are the only one capable of using lightning as a weapon.&quot; 

Leda blinked. &quot;Captain, I remember fighting someone who could call 
down lightning bolts in a manner similar to my Jupiter Thunder.&quot; 

The telepath shot her a dark look. &quot;So you say. According to our 
records at the time of the incident, slightly over six hundred 
denizens have some form of control over lightning. Of those six 
hundred, only eight were within the general area of where you were 
fighting. And of those eight, all of them have been accounted for as 
being elsewhere when Orestan was killed.&quot; 

Leda shook her head. &quot;Forgive me, Captain, but I know what I saw.&quot; She 
rolled up the sleeve of her blouse and pointed to a fading scar just 
below her elbow. &quot;This is where he hit me with a blast of lightning 
while we were having it out.&quot; 

&quot;So you claim. I cannot determine the validity of your statement as I 
was not there and we have no living witnesses aside from yourself and 
the other Sailor Scouts. The only proof I have are his charred remains 
and your Jupiter Thunder. That might not be enough for most, but it is 
enough for me,&quot; the telepath said bitterly. 

Leda looked out towards the mountain and its eternal storm. &quot;Captain, 
how can I convince you that I&#39;m telling the truth?&quot; she asked quietly 
after several minutes of silence. 

&quot;I would have to probe the memories of someone who was there and 
witnessed all that transpired,&quot; came the equally quiet reply. &quot;In this 
case, your own mind and it&#39;s memories would be the key.&quot; 

Leda blinked. &quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot; 

&quot;I would have to probe your mind, Jupiter, and replay the memories you 
obtained during that battle. You would be required to open your entire 
mind to me.&quot; She laughed quietly, a soft but bitter sound. &quot;You would 
be foolish to do so, for at that close a contact I could destroy every 
single neural fiber in your brain with a mere thought.&quot; 

Leda paled at the image that came to mind. &quot;But you gave your word to 
Tolaris that you wouldn&#39;t harm me without definite proof, and I 
believe you to be a woman of honor.&quot; 

Whisper gave her a hard look. &quot;You are either a very trusting 
individual or a fool to say so, considering I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing you 
dead.&quot; 

&quot;Tolaris trusts you and I trust Tolaris&#39;s judgement. If I am wrong in 
trusting you, then I would pay for my mistake with my life or worse. 
But if I am right, then I stand to gain a friend, or at least an ally 
I won&#39;t have to worry about killing me as I sleep.&quot; 

The telepath nodded slowly. &quot;Very well, Sailor Jupiter, I will do what 
you ask. But I must warn you that your mind will be completely open to 
me, and while I will seek the desired memories as fast as possible, I 
may accidentally unveil personal or sensitive memories.&quot; 

Leda nodded. &quot;Understood, Captain. What must I do?&quot; 

Whisper knelt down on the ground. &quot;Just sit down and close your eyes. 
I will contact your mind and we will start from there.&quot; 

Leda knelt down in front of Whisper and closed her eyes. She felt a 
pair of hands lightly touching her temples and everything went 
dark.... 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

It was the essence of darkness, the total absence of everything. She 
had no concept of direction, no concept of physical dimensions or even 
physical existence. She just existed, a single mind alone in a 
universe of its own. 

What is this? 

&lt;This is the manifestation of your subconscious mind&gt; said a thought 
from everywhere and nowhere. &lt;In short, this is the inside of your 
mind&gt; 

Where are you? 

The sound of gentle laughter. &lt;I am here, with you. This is your mind, 
your world. I can only observe from a distance. This is what you 
choose to make it&gt; 

I don&#39;t understand.... 

&lt;Of course you wouldn&#39;t. You haven&#39;t spent decades of your life 
learning how to control your mind. Even at this speed, explaining 
things enough for you to understand would take several months of 
real-time&gt; 

Speed? How fast is this happening? 

&lt;At the speed of thought. Even though it feels as if several minutes 
have passed since we started, I assure you that no more than a 
hundredth of a second in real-time has passed&gt; 

I feel lost.... 

A warming reassurance filled her being. &lt;You are merely unfamiliar 
with the workings of your own mind, that&#39;s all. In time, you will 
learn how to control and even alter your mind. In the meantime, I will 
act as your guide, though I can do very little except observe&gt; 

What must I do now that we&#39;re here? 

&lt;You must first learn how to remember&gt; 

Remember? But I already can.... 

&lt;Can you? Then remember what happened that day&gt; 

Shock and confusion filled her as she realized she could not. What 
have you done to me? 

A gentle and patient sigh. &lt;This is your subconscious, not your 
conscious mind. Your conscious memories can be altered or even 
destroyed by time, but the memories your subconscious gather remain 
pure and unaltered. How your mind stores your subconscious memories is 
different from how your mind stores the conscious memories. When you 
remember, you trace down a certain neural path to a certain conscious 
memory. You must relearn which neural paths to take to reach your 
subconscious memories&gt; 

How can I do this? 

&lt;Unfortunately, it can only be done by trial-and-error. I will do my 
best to guide you, but it is up to you to lead me to the correct set 
of memories. Imagine your memories as a spider web, with each single 
memory being only one strand in a vast field of webs. Touch a memory 
and it will disturb the ones near it, revealing their contents. Follow 
familiar memories across strands and webs to the ones you seek&gt; 

Comprehension dawned on her like a sun rising above the horizon for 
the very first time. I understand now.... 

Again the sound of gentle laughter. &lt;You only understand a tiny 
portion of your mind&#39;s capabilities, but it is enough for our purpose. 
I will start walking on the strands of your memories and you must 
guide me as we go. Are you ready?&gt; 

I am.... 

&lt;Then let us proceed....&gt; 

The world, the very universe burst into light, color, sound, and 
motion as something rippled ever so lightly. 

&quot;Thunderheart....&quot; said the image of a girl with emerald-green hair. 
As quickly as it had come, everything was gone, leaving only utter 
darkness. 

This is not directly related.... yet I feel as if this is a start.... 

&lt;If it is indeed a start, then we should follow it to the end&gt; A sense 
of understanding enveloped her as the surrounding memories were 
revealed. &lt;I see. She was your lover?&gt; 

A slight feeling of shame and embarrassment filled her being. Yes.... 

&lt;Why do you feel ashamed of this?&gt; 

It is not socially acceptable for two women to be lovers.... 
especially considering our respective ages.... 

&lt;Yet you felt no shame when you two were together....&gt; 

No.... 

&lt;Then why do you feel shame now?&gt; The voice was silent as more 
memories were revealed. &lt;You feel ashamed of your past because of 
him?&gt; 

Not exactly.... 

Anger enveloped her like a stormcloud. &lt;Because of what he did to you&gt; 

Yes.... Even now, I find it hard to believe I did.... that.... 

She could not explain her feelings, yet a sense of understanding and 
warm acceptance surrounded her. 

&lt;It matters not, though I did not mean to transgress....&gt; 

The web of memories continued to ripple in a slowly expanding ring. 

A sense of unease wrapped around her. &lt;There is a sizable gap in your 
memory here, following Jenni&#39;s death....&gt; 

It is not related.... 

&lt;Do you remember?&gt; 

Not what happened, but only that it is not related.... 

A memory of another lover surfaced in the tangled web. &lt;But this is&gt; 

Yes.... 

A slight laugh. &lt;Sailor Venus?&gt; 

Yes, Mina.... 

The laughter continued briefly. &lt;Maze would be mildly upset if he knew 
that you two are lovers&gt; 

Embarrassment filled her being. I don&#39;t know if we qualify as 
lovers.... 

&lt;It matters not unless either one of you tells him&gt; The web twitched 
slightly as the ripple changed directions. &lt;You two have been friends 
for a long time&gt; 

Yes.... 

&lt;She was with you, wasn&#39;t she?&gt; 

Yes.... I can remember more, now.... 

A sense of accomplishment surrounded her. &lt;Excellent, then we are 
getting close to the desired memories&gt; 

Yes.... I.... I remember now! 

&lt;Good. Start at the beginning, and work your way from there...&gt; 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

&quot;What do we have here?&quot; growled her opponent, leering at the slash 
marks on her blouse. Her gaze never left his as they slowly circled 
around each other, looking for the chance to strike. His left hand was 
outlined in the harsh light of electricity being somehow formed into a 
sword-like projection. 

She said nothing in response, keeping most of her concentration on her 
adversary. The rest of her concentration was on the energy level in 
the tiny lightning rod on her tiara. She caught motion out of the 
corner of her eye and lashed out, the tip of her boot making a solid 
connection with the head of the denizen trying to sneak up on her. He 
went down and she prepared herself for the impending attack. 

Her opponent lunged at her and she dodged, but she couldn&#39;t get clear 
of the blade in time. Pain shot down the length of her arm as the tip 
of the energy projection caught her just below the elbow. She was 
getting ready to unleash her Jupiter Thunder when she heard a familiar 
voice behind her. 

&quot;Jupiter, get down!&quot; yelled Venus. 

She wasted no time and immediately flopped down on the hard ground. 
Her opponent didn&#39;t have enough time to react as a searing light 
formed at Venus&#39;s fingertips and lashed out, blasting a hole in his 
chest. He grunted in shock and collapsed, a small pool of dark blue 
blood beginning to form around him. 

&quot;Thanks, Venus....&quot; she started to say, but was cut of by a gesture. 

&quot;Save it for later, girl, if we manage to get out of this one alive,&quot; 
the blonde Sailor Scout said with a smile. The smile slid off of her 
face as a crossbow bolt missed her by inches and imbedded itself into 
a small boulder. 

They both jumped behind the boulder as another bolt shot past them, 
again missing by inches. &quot;I don&#39;t like this,&quot; she said and Venus 
laughed ironically. 

&quot;Only sick people like being shot at,&quot; she said. &quot;Up there, standing 
next to that tree.&quot; 

Jupiter nodded. &quot;I see him. Double team?&quot; 

Venus grinned at her. &quot;You bet,&quot; she said and stood up. She 
concentrated a pair of crescent beams formed at her fingertips. &quot;Venus 
Crescent Beam....&quot; 

Jupiter also stood up and focused her mind on her tiara. The miniature 
lightning rod extended itself again and began to charge with energy. 
&quot;Jupiter Thunder....&quot; 

They focused their energies towards their target, intent on merging 
them into a single, more powerful blast of power. 

&quot;SMASH!&quot; 

&quot;CRASH!&quot; 

The beam of power merged with the bolt of lighting and intensified 
into a blindingly-bright wave of pure energy. The wave darted towards 
its target and suddenly encountered an electromagnetic barrier 
surrounding the denizen. 

With an ear-shattering explosion, the two powers were reflected off of 
the energy shield and split. The Crescent Beam darted off at an odd 
angle and blew a hole in a distant building while the lightning bolt 
plowed through a group of attacking denizens. 

Screams of pain filled the air as the denizens were electrocuted and 
fell into lifeless heaps. The screams were suddenly drowned out by a 
series of loud explosions, followed by an incredible burst of light as 
the distant building was disintegrated. 

Jupiter and Venus saw the shock wave coming towards then and they dove 
for cover behind the boulder. The wave of intense pressure swept past 
them and their skin crawled with the sheer power of the winds. When 
the shock wave had gone past them, they cautiously poked their heads 
up past the boulder to see what happened. 

The rest of the Sailor Scouts and Tuxedo Mask where standing behind 
Sailor Moon. She had the Crescent Moon Wand held up high and was 
generating some sort of barrier around them, protecting them from the 
shock wave. The bodies of the attacking denizens lay around them, all 
badly battered and bleeding. 

Sailor Mercury did a quick scan with her computer and sadly shook her 
head back and forth. Sailor Moon sighed quietly and let the barrier 
fade before she motioned for Jupiter and Venus to catch up with them. 

Victorious yet saddened by the waste, they continued on towards their 
only hope for escape. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Leda blinked as the world suddenly sprang into existence around her. 
She shook her head and looked up to find Captain Whisper kneeling next 
to her, just as she had been before the mind probe started. 

&quot;Captain, I....&quot; Leda started to say. 

Whisper stood up and made a gesture. &quot;Say nothing, Jupiter,&quot; she said 
in a dark tone. She took a deep breath and stared out into the night, 
gathering her thoughts together. &quot;Even though it was indeed your 
Jupiter Thunder that killed him, it wasn&#39;t your fault. Nor is Venus to 
be held responsible for the destruction of the Psi-Corp headquarters. 
The moment your powers bounced off of that energy barrier, they became 
stray shots and thus held unaccountable according to our laws.&quot; 

Leda frowned. &quot;But what do you feel about the matter?&quot; 

Whisper sighed quietly and faced her. &quot;I suspect that I will come to 
agree with the law given sufficient time. However, it was still you 
and Venus who fired and caused the destruction. I won&#39;t seek vengeance 
on either one of you, but if the opportunity arises to do so I doubt 
I&#39;ll refuse.&quot; 

Leda nodded, not really expecting anything more. &quot;I think I can live 
with that. For now, at least.&quot; 

Whisper nodded and turned to walk away. She paused as a thought 
occurred to her and she turned her head back towards Leda. &quot;You don&#39;t 
have to worry about watching your back around me, Jupiter. When the 
time for vengence comes, you&#39;ll see it coming,&quot; she said, then quietly 
left the clearing. 

Leda said nothing as she once again looked out towards the mountain 
peak and its eternal thunderstorm, a new set of thoughts and worries 
plaguing her mind and troubling her soul. 

She lost track of all time as she leaned against an ancient tree, 
staring at the constant storm on the horizon and thinking about her 
life as a Sailor Scout. With all the damage we&#39;ve done and all the 
lives we&#39;ve taken, how can we be all that different than the 
Negaverse? We have really different motives for doing what we do, of 
course, but still.... 

Her thoughts were interrupted when she was grabbed from behind and 
held in a tight grip, one arm pinning her arms at her waist while the 
other keeping her from making any sound. The impulse to scream had 
just reached her brain when her captor started whispering in her ear. 

&quot;Forgive me, but this was the only way to get your entire attention. 
Stop struggling and listen to me.... There is a small scouting party 
headed towards your friends&#39; location, and I believe they are aware 
that you are the Sailor Scouts. You must return to warn them and 
quickly. I did what I could to delay them but they should be here 
within minutes.&quot; 

Leda has stood still while he spoke, not sure of what she should do. 
She noticed with some unease that the arms holding her were formed 
like those of a giant cat, with short, dark fur and recessed claws. 
The thought of being a prisoner of a giant panther didn&#39;t sit well and 
she furiously thought of a plan of escape. 

&quot;I know you have no reason to trust me,&quot; he continued, &quot;But the lives 
of your friends are in danger.&quot; He paused for a moment and Leda felt 
something soft and fuzzy brush her cheek. &quot;I hope we can meet again 
under different circumstances, Leda. Now go....&quot; he said, releasing 
his grip and giving her a small shove, just enough to set her slightly 
off-balance. 

She stumbled but quickly recovered and turned around. She stopped and 
blinked in confusion when she discovered that she was alone in the 
clearing. She briefly wondered if she had been hallucinating, but the 
voice still echoing in her mind had seemed all too real. 

Leda made a decision and ran off towards the camp as fast as she 
could, pausing only long enough to transform into Sailor Jupiter. When 
she arrived at the camp, she was out of breath and her hands were 
shaking slightly but she wasn&#39;t sure if it was from the exertion of 
running. 

&quot;Heads up, guys,&quot; she blurted out as the rest of the group looked at 
her. &quot;We&#39;re going to get company and soon, so transform and get ready 
to rumble,&quot; she said, leaning against a small tree for a few seconds. 
The other Sailor Scouts started to transform while Tolaris and Whisper 
started to put together a quick plan of defense. 

&quot;What have we got, Jupiter?&quot; Tolaris asked. 

&quot;Umm, I&#39;m not entirely sure....&quot; she said and gave them an explanation 
of what happened. Tolaris and Whisper exchanged surprised glances 
before the Psi-Corp captain nodded and started to telepathically check 
the area. 

&quot;Contact,&quot; she said after a brief moment. &quot;Six minds, all clustered in 
a single group, heading towards us from that direction,&quot; she said, 
pointing past a dense group of trees. She blinked and a small smile 
crept across her face. &quot;And one of them is telepathic.&quot; 

Tolaris smirked as he took up a position behind a large tree. 
&quot;Everyone, take cover and get ready. You going to be okay, Captain? 
You look like you&#39;re under siege.&quot; 

Whisper smiled and crouched behind a bush. &quot;I am, but it&#39;s a pathetic 
attempt at a mind blast. Just listen for the scream and that&#39;ll tell 
you how close he is.&quot; Her words were quickly followed by a loud and 
piercing scream. 

Five armored soldiers suddenly burst into the clearing and began to 
open fire on the concealed Sailor Scouts. Behind them, a sixth armored 
denizen staggered into the clearing, clutching his head. Before anyone 
could react to his presence, he stumbled and collapsed, bright green 
blood pouring from his ears and nostrils. 

The Sailor Scouts started to return fire and Tolaris gave Whisper a 
small smile. &quot;Wasn&#39;t that just a bit messy?&quot; he said as he leapt from 
cover and unleashed several lightning bolts towards the attacking 
denizens. 

&quot;Would you preferred he was still up and shooting at us?&quot; she replied 
as she focused her mind on another target. 

&quot;Actually.... no,&quot; the Dragoon said with a laugh before turning his 
full attention towards the battle. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

&quot;Mercury Bubbles.... BLAST!!&quot; she yelled, releasing control of her 
powers and filling the area with a dense fog bank. As soon as the 
diversionary fog was in place, she stepped back to give the other 
Sailor Scouts more room to deal with their opponents. 

Mercury sighed quietly to herself and started to scan the area with 
both her computer and her Virtual Visor. There were some days where 
she wished she could play a more active role in combat, but she was 
quite often content to sit on the sidelines and observe. No one minded 
this since her observations have often helped the rest of the team 
gain an edge or to avoid a trap. 

She caught motion out of the corner of her eye and looked up in time 
to catch Sailor Jupiter jab an elbow into an armored denizen before 
flipping him over her shoulder to land hard on the ground. 

The fallen warrior reacted by slamming his fist into the ground, 
causing the whole forest floor to shake unsteadily. Mercury grabbed 
onto the tree as the earthquake reached her and she lost most of her 
balance. She looked up in horror as Sailor Jupiter flailed wildly for 
balance before falling down right beside the denizen. 

Her Virtual Visor superimposed a flashing red aura around the denizen 
just as she saw the gleam of light reflecting off of his drawn dagger. 
Just as she realized that he was preparing to stab the still-prone 
Jupiter, her Visor started tracking the path of a projectile. Moving 
faster than Mercury could follow, the object slammed into the 
denizen&#39;s chest and imbedded itself. 

The warrior screamed in agony before collapsing in a rapidly-forming 
pool of dark blue blood. Sailor Jupiter blinked in surprise and looked 
for the source of the projectile. Sailor Mercury did so as well and 
was surprised to find Sailor Mars standing next to a tree, her arm 
still raised from throwing her dagger. 

&quot;Did I get him?&quot; Mars called out as she started running towards Sailor 
Jupiter and the fallen denizen. Jupiter&#39;s response was to quickly 
reach down, yank the dagger out of the injured denizen, and to throw 
the blade as hard as she could towards Sailor Mars. 

Sailor Mercury blinked as her Visor did two things simultaneously: It 
projected a trajectory for the dagger and outlined the denizen 
sneaking up behind Sailor Mars in a flashing white aura. The 
information barely had enough time to sink into her brain before the 
dagger impacted with the denizen&#39;s arm. 

Mars screamed in surprise and shock as her blouse and arm were 
splashed with dark red blood. Both Mercury and Jupiter ran towards 
Sailor Mars, the former intent on checking for injury and the latter 
intent on injuring the denizen. 

Even before she reached Mars, Sailor Mercury&#39;s Virtual Visor seemed to 
go haywire, outlining the denizen in flashing gold and superimposing 
strange readings over him. She blinked in shock as the meanings of the 
readings sank in. She was about to have her computer scan again when 
Sailor Jupiter&#39;s voice brought her back to the present. 

&quot;Jupiter Thunder....&quot; she said, the miniature lightning rod extending 
from her tiara and charging with energy. 

&quot;Jupiter, wait!&quot; Sailor Mercury cried out, &quot;Don&#39;t hurt him, I want him 
alive!&quot; 

Both Jupiter and Mars paused momentarily and gave her confused looks. 
The denizen used the instant of distraction to pull the dagger out of 
his arm and launch himself at Sailor Mars. 

Time seemed to slow to a crawl for Mercury as the scene unfolded. 
Without knowing why, she concentrated her powers into a sphere in 
front of her. Sailor Jupiter realized the danger to Mars and continued 
running, ignoring her tiara completely and changing her direction to 
intercept Mars, intent on pushing her out of the way. 

&quot;Mercury Ice Bubbles....&quot; 

Sailor Jupiter slammed full-tilt into Sailor Mars just as the denizen 
reached her and swung the dagger, the edges of the blade still coated 
with blue and red blood. Both Sailor Scouts tumbled out of the way and 
the dagger hit only empty air. The denizen glanced up at Mercury, his 
eyes going wide as he saw the sphere of power she had aimed at him. 

&quot;FREEZE!!&quot; Sailor Mercury yelled as she released the bubble. The 
sphere darted towards the denizen and splashed against his chest like 
a water balloon. The supercooled water froze on impact, completely 
encasing the denizen inside a thick layer of ice and rendering him 
immobile. 

The flow of time seemed to return to normal and Mercury blinked as her 
reaction fully sank in. &quot;I did that?&quot; she asked incrediously, looking 
at the frozen denizen. 

&quot;Looks that way,&quot; said Tolaris from behind her. Mercury jumped and 
turned around to see the Dragoon commander rubbing a sore spot on his 
shoulder. &quot;We took care of the others and I&#39;ve dispersed what&#39;s left 
of your fog. Nice lawn ornament,&quot; he said, gesturing to the frozen 
denizen. &quot;A bit ugly, perhaps, but I&#39;m no art critic.&quot; 

Sailor Moon walked over and stood next to Mercury, her blue eyes wide 
with wonder. &quot;Wow, Mercury, those weren&#39;t your usual bubbles.... Is 
that your new power?&quot; 

Mercury nodded. &quot;Probably, seeing how I couldn&#39;t do this before.&quot; She 
blinked as a thought occurred to her and she glanced down. &quot;Umm, do 
either of you two plan on getting up?&quot; 

Jupiter moaned and sat up, She wiped a streak of dirt off of her arm 
and gave Mercury a pitiful look. &quot;Do I have to? Most of my muscles 
hurt now....&quot; She glanced over and poked Sailor Mars. &quot;You okay?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, except for being slammed in the stomach by you....&quot; was the 
muffled reply. She was lying face-down on the ground and showed no 
signs of injury. &quot;Umm, I&#39;ll just stay here for a few minutes if you 
don&#39;t mind....&quot; 

&quot;Lazy bum,&quot; Jupiter sighed as she grabbed Mars&#39;s arm. &quot;C&#39;mon, time to 
get up....&quot; 

&quot;No, wait...!&quot; Sailor Mars started to say, but was interrupted when 
she was flipped over onto her back by Jupiter. Her problem was 
instantly revealed as the front of her blouse remained caught in the 
dirt. She immediately turned back over but not in time to prevent 
Tuxedo Mask from getting a clear view of her breasts as he approached 
the group. 

&quot;Well, that battle was.... WHOA!&quot; he said, turning away with a dark 
blush on his cheeks. &quot;You, umm, having problems with your suit again, 
Mars?&quot; 

&quot;What was your first clue?&quot; Mars replied acidly. &quot;Could someone go get 
me the sewing kit and a large towel, please?&quot; 

&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; Jupiter said as she ran off to get the kit. 
Tolaris chuckled quietly to himself as a small fog bank sprang up 
around Sailor Mars and hid her from everyone&#39;s sight. 

&quot;Thanks, Commander!&quot; came the muffled voice from within the fog. 

Sailor Venus walked up to the group with a smile on her face. &quot;You 
know, Mars, life would be easier if you decided to wear a bra,&quot; she 
said rather mischievously. 

Mars laughed from within the fog bank. &quot;You know as well as I do that 
these stupid suits don&#39;t come with bras,&quot; she replied. There was a 
muffled grunt as Jupiter tossed the towel and the kit into the middle 
of the fog. &quot;Ow, thanks, Jupiter.&quot; 

&quot;Sorry.&quot; 

Tuxedo Mask blinked in confusion and blushed yet again. &quot;Umm.... your 
suits don&#39;t come with bras?&quot; 

Jupiter smirked. &quot;No, they don&#39;t, but we do have the essentials, thank 
Zeus. You can get Sailor Moon to give you a full display if you like.&quot; 

&quot;Ha ha, very funny....&quot; Sailor Moon said with a blush. &quot;If I remember 
right, you&#39;re the one who insisted on showing everyone your differing 
hair colors.&quot; 

Tolaris coughed lightly. &quot;If you ladies are finished, we have a few 
small details to resolve, like what we plan to do with our captive?&quot; 

Sailor Moon blinked. &quot;Is he alive in there?&quot; 

&quot;He is,&quot; Whisper said as she approached the group. &quot;I can feel his 
mind. He is very much alive, and that is good. I&#39;m going to 
interrogate him to find out who sent him and how much he knows about 
us.&quot; 

Sailor Mercury frowned. &quot;Try not to hurt him. I want him alive.&quot; 

Whisper blinked. &quot;Whatever for?&quot; 

Mercury held up her computer. &quot;My scans show that his blood 
composition is almost identical to that of a human&#39;s.&quot; 

The Psi-Corp captain frowned. &quot;I&#39;m not following you.&quot; 

Sailor Venus frowned as well. &quot;Are you that hungry?&quot; 

&quot;Not yet, but the rest of you need your blood.&quot; 

&quot;Hold it,&quot; Whisper demanded. &quot;Would one of you explain to me what 
you&#39;re talking about?&quot; 

Sailor Mercury sighed quietly and put her computer in her 
extradimensional pocket. &quot;You were never told, Captain, simply because 
no one thought it was necessary for you to know. As I told Lieutenant 
Maze earlier, I am a vampire,&quot; she said quietly as she changed to her 
vampiric form. 

Whisper paled and stepped back slightly. &quot;I.... I see,&quot; she said 
slowly. &quot;So it wasn&#39;t just a rumor of a vampire on Earth.&quot; 

&quot;No, it wasn&#39;t,&quot; Mercury said. &quot;Now do you understand why I want him 
in one piece?&quot; 

Whisper nodded, still visibly shaken. &quot;Yes. I&#39;ll do my best to keep 
him unharmed, but we need to know what he knows and that might get 
rather difficult if he resists the probe.&quot; 

&quot;I understand, Captain.&quot; 

Tolaris nodded. &quot;If you two can handle things, I&#39;ve got to get going 
over to the complex to get the information from Lieutenant Maze.&quot; 

&quot;I think we can handle an ice cube, Commander,&quot; Whisper said dryly. 

&quot;Can I come with you?&quot; asked Sailor Venus. She blinked as everyone 
turned to give her looks of surprise and wonder. &quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;Going to go see Maze?&quot; Jupiter asked with a grin. 

Venus nodded. &quot;Why else would I be going?&quot; 

&quot;Curiosity,&quot; chorused the rest of the group. 

&quot;Am I that bad?&quot; the blonde said with a faint blush. 

Tuxedo Mask laughed. &quot;On occasion.&quot; 

&quot;Sorry. Still, I want to go with you, Commander.&quot; 

Tolaris sighed quietly. &quot;Give me a few minutes to think about it. I&#39;m 
not sure that it would be a wise idea to take a Sailor Scout into the 
middle of the Dragoon headquarters.&quot; 

Venus gave him her best smile. &quot;Please think about it while I talk to 
Sailor Mercury about something. In the meantime, perhaps someone 
should check on Sailor Mars, since she&#39;s our best bet at getting that 
soldier out of that ice.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m not going anywhere until I get this stupid suit fixed,&quot; said 
Mars, still inside the fog bank. 

&quot;Need help?&quot; Sailor Moon asked. 

&quot;No thanks, I&#39;m almost done,&quot; replied Mars. 

Sailor Venus quietly led Sailor Mercury far away enough from the group 
so they could talk in relative peace. &quot;So what&#39;s on your mind?&quot; 
Mercury asked once they reached a secluded section of trees. 

&quot;Just a bit of a warning. You might want to put off draining our 
friend until Tolaris gets back from the complex.&quot; 

Mercury blinked. &quot;Why is that?&quot; 

&quot;Well, according to some of the more arcane lore, when a female 
vampire takes blood from a male victim, they both become highly 
aroused and more often than not wind up in bed. While I&#39;m not sure if 
this would be the case with you, you might not want to take the 
chance,&quot; Venus said with a weak smile. 

Mercury gave her an odd look. &quot;Right.... What makes you think I&#39;d want 
to get.... involved, so to speak, with our captive?&quot; 

Venus giggled. &quot;Nothing, but it&#39;s just that a horny vampire isn&#39;t one 
to be taken lightly. It would be prudent to keep Tolaris around to.... 
umm.... deal with the situation should the need arise.&quot; 

&quot;Funny....&quot; Mercury said dryly. &quot;Speaking of which, why are you so 
eager to see Maze tonight?&quot; 

Venus blushed and studied the ground. &quot;I really can&#39;t explain it.... I 
just want to see him again, that&#39;s all.&quot; 

&quot;Is that all?&quot; Mercury replied quietly. &quot;Mina, I felt the same why you 
do now when I first met Tolaris. All I wanted to do was to be with 
him, to talk to him. I&#39;m not sure when we fell in love, but it was 
fairly quickly. And not too long after that we started getting 
passionate.&quot; 

Venus said nothing as she continued to stare at the ground. She looked 
up when Mercury gently tucked a stray lock of blonde hair behind her 
ear. &quot;I know how you think and how you deal with things, Mina. You 
plan to do more than just talk to Maze, right?&quot; 

&quot;Yes,&quot; was the soft reply, &quot;I was hoping to stay the night for several 
reasons. One being I don&#39;t care for camping too much, and another 
reason is that it would be a tactical advantage to have a Sailor Scout 
on the inside of the complex when you make your move tomorrow morning. 
Maze and I can take down most of the guards before you arrive.&quot; 

Mercury nodded. &quot;You should tell this to Tolaris. It might help him 
make a decision.&quot; 

Venus nodded and turned to leave, but stopped when Mercury gently 
grabbed her arm. &quot;Mina, there&#39;s more to it than that, correct?&quot; She 
saw the look of hesitation in the blonde&#39;s eyes and added, &quot;You can 
tell me. I&#39;m not quite a doctor yet, but I still believe in 
doctor-patient confidentiality.&quot; 

&quot;Well.... I was.... thinking of.... of....&quot; 

&quot;Of making love to him?&quot; Mercury finished softly. 

&quot;Yes. You and Jupiter had both said that it was a wonderful 
experience, providing that you care about each other. If Maze feels 
the same way about me that I do about him, then it could be just as 
good if not better than when Leda made love to me,&quot; Sailor Venus said 
quietly. 

Mercury nodded in understanding. &quot;Just make absolutely sure that you 
know what his intentions are before you do anything. And if you do, 
I&#39;d like it if you come see me afterwards, just so I can do a quick 
scan.&quot; 

Venus nodded slowly. &quot;Thanks, Ami. For everything,&quot; she said and 
turned to head back to the rest of the group. 

&quot;Oh, and Mina?&quot; 

The blonde paused and looked back with a curious expression. &quot;Yes?&quot; 

&quot;Be careful.&quot; 

&quot;I will,&quot; Venus said and quietly left Sailor Mercury alone to herself 
and to her thoughts. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Sailor Mars knelt several feet away from the frozen denizen. Her 
sailor suit had been patched up as best as she could, but there were 
still several tiny slash marks in various places. It was times like 
this where she was glad that her bow was large enough to cover a few 
of the more revealing gaps. 

&quot;Try not to imagine your power as merely a weapon to be hurled at your 
opponents,&quot; Tolaris said quietly from behind her. &quot;Imagine the fire as 
part of your hand.... part of your arm.... part of your entire being. 
Wield it as if you were merely moving a finger.&quot; 

Mars let the words fade into the background as she slid deeper into 
her meditation. She needed to focus her mind to use her Mars Fire with 
precision if there was any hope of freeing their captive. Already she 
could feel the beginnings of power forming at her steepled fingertips. 

&quot;Now imagine that same power leaving your body and taking a form of 
its own, still part of you and under your control. Imagine that your 
body is able to transcend your physical limitations and roam free by 
thought alone.&quot; 

The image of a bird formed in her mind and she focused on it. She 
could feel the feathered form take shape from within her soul and fly 
around the forest, moving here and there at her command. The bird dove 
for the denizen, her razor claws barely touching the frozen edges. 
Again and again the bird made light contact under her command. She 
could feel the power growing inside her until she thought it would 
utterly consume her being. 

&quot;Mars Firebird....&quot; she found herself saying as the fireball formed at 
her fingertips. The fireball writhed and moved about as if it were a 
living being, waiting to be released. She continued to build up power 
until she was unable to contain it any longer. 

&quot;STRIKE!&quot; she commanded as the fireball launched itself. It imploded 
in mid-flight and unfurled itself into the form of a fiery phoenix. 
Great wings filled the sky as the bird took flight, circling the 
frozen denizen like a hunter stalking her prey. At her command, the 
phoenix began to carefully melt the ice away with her beak and claws 
while leaving the denizen unscathed. 

The great bird flew away as the final layer of ice shattered under the 
soldier&#39;s weight and he collapsed. The phoenix threw her head back and 
cried out a shrill victory call before the flames composing her body 
died out and she vanished into nothingness. 

No one was more surprised by the events than Sailor Mars. She 
continued to kneel, her bottomless black eyes wide with wonder and 
surprise. &quot;What.... What was that?&quot; she finally managed to say. 

&quot;You&#39;re asking us?&quot; Tuxedo Mask said, his jaw still hanging open. 

&quot;My guess is that was your new power,&quot; Sailor Venus said. 

&quot;Cool....&quot; Mars smiled as she stood up. 

There was a muffled groan as the denizen warrior tried to get up off 
of the ground. &quot;Down, boy,&quot; Sailor Jupiter said as she shoved him back 
down with the tip of her boot. &quot;Ready when you are, Captain,&quot; she 
said, keeping a wary eye on the denizen. 

Whisper nodded and sat down next to the warrior. Taking a deep breath, 
she placed her hand on his forehead. Both of them immediately 
stiffened as a quick psionic battle took place. Only a few seconds had 
passed before the denizen slumped to the ground and Whisper&#39;s face 
lost all expression. 

&quot;This is going to take some time,&quot; she said in a flat monotone. &quot;I 
will let you know when I am finished, so do not disturb either one of 
us until that time.&quot; The telepath then closed her eyes and lost all 
contact with the real world. 

Tolaris nodded. &quot;Okay, everyone, listen up. Whisper means what she 
says and would be highly upset if you were to disturb her. I want you 
to pitch the tents and set up a defensive perimeter. You can decide 
among yourselves who gets to stand guard. I&#39;ll try to return as 
quickly as I can and will let you know I&#39;m back by summoning a fog 
cloud. Anyone have any questions?&quot; 

Sailor Venus coughed lightly. &quot;Just one, Commander....&quot; 

Tolaris sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. &quot;Against my better 
judgement, Miss Venus, you may come with me. Anyone else have any 
questions?&quot; No one said anything and he finally nodded. &quot;Good. Sailor 
Moon, you&#39;re in command until I return. Sailor Venus, let&#39;s go,&quot; he 
said and started walking in the direction of the Dragoon complex. 

Sailor Venus only paused long enough to reverse her transformation and 
to make sure her dagger was where she could reach it before she ran 
off after the Dragoon. Mina waved to the rest of the group before they 
turned down a small path and disappeared from sight. 

&quot;I hope she knows what she&#39;s doing,&quot; Sailor Mars said as she moved 
next to Sailor Moon. 

&quot;I think she does,&quot; Mercury said quietly. &quot;Anyway, we should do what 
Tolaris said and start setting up the tents.&quot; 

&quot;Easy enough,&quot; said Tuxedo Mask. &quot;If someone can work on getting 
dinner ready, I can get the tents set up.&quot; 

&quot;I can start the fire,&quot; Mars suggested. 

Sailor Moon nodded. &quot;So who wants to volunteer to stand guard?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ve got the first shift,&quot; Sailor Jupiter said quietly. 

&quot;I&#39;ll take the second,&quot; Tuxedo Mask said as he unpacked one of the 
tents. 

Sailor Moon blinked. &quot;Umm, Jupiter, if you&#39;re standing guard, who&#39;s 
going to cook?&quot; 

Mercury smiled. &quot;I can handle it. I don&#39;t think I can cook as good as 
she can, but I can still make edible food.&quot; 

Sailor Moon started counting tasks on her fingers and came up one 
short. &quot;Wait a minute.... Umm, what am I supposed to do?&quot; 

Mars smiled slowly. &quot;How good are you at sewing?&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Tolaris and Mina stood crouched behind a large boulder several dozen 
yards away from the Dragoon headquarters complex. Both were more than 
slightly nervous and Tolaris was frowning in concern as he looked at 
the side entrance and the pair of guards stationed there. 

&quot;Problem, Commander?&quot; Mina asked quietly. 

&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; he replied. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen the complex so inactive. 
Usually there&#39;s a good stream of traffic going in and out that side 
door.&quot; 

&quot;It could be because of that deployment Whisper was talking about,&quot; 
she suggested. 

Tolaris nodded. &quot;It could be, but that worries me too. If the majority 
of the division was moved out towards the Outreaches, why didn&#39;t they 
take Maze or Ra&#39;vel? They&#39;re both highly seasoned field officers.&quot; 

&quot;Speaking of officiers,&quot; Mina said as she tugged on his rank insignia, 
&quot;I thought you were supposed to be using lieutenant&#39;s stripes.&quot; 

Tolaris blinked and glanced down. &quot;Hmm, I thought I already did that,&quot; 
he said as he took hold of a stripe and yanked. Within seconds he had 
removed two of his rank stripes, giving him the appearance of a 
Dragoon lieutenant. 

Mina nodded. &quot;Do you have a plan for getting me in or are we going to 
have to improvise?&quot; 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;Improvise, unless you have an idea.&quot; 

She smiled. &quot;If that&#39;s the case, Lieutenant Sterling, you&#39;ve been 
ordered to escort Lieutenant Maze&#39;s niece to the complex so she can 
see what his job is like. She might even want to become a Dragoon 
herself if she likes it enough.&quot; 

The Dragoon thought for a few seconds before slowly nodding in 
agreement. &quot;Sounds plausible enough. I&#39;m not sure if Maze has any 
living relatives or not, but they&#39;re not going to stop us to run a 
history check.&quot; He chuckled quietly to himself for a few seconds 
before adding, &quot;At this rate, we&#39;ll make you a fully commissioned 
Dragoon before we return to Earth.&quot; 

&quot;Isn&#39;t there a regulation about not permitting officiers to have 
personal relations within the ranks?&quot; she inquired sweetly. &quot;If so, 
then both Maze and myself would be slightly upset.&quot; 

Tolaris smiled. &quot;I see your point.&quot; He glanced back towards the 
complex, blinked in surprise, and smiled. &quot;Looks like we&#39;re about to 
get a break. Or to be more precise, that first guard is.&quot; 

Mina looked at the guard and frowned. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; 

&quot;See the way he keeps shifting that lower chestplate?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah....&quot; 

&quot;That armor makes a full bladder very uncomfortable,&quot; Tolaris said 
with a knowing smile. &quot;I&#39;ll make a bet that he is going to go take a 
restroom break very soon.&quot; His smile widened as the first guard said 
something to the second, then quickly entered the building. 

&quot;When you gotta go, you gotta go,&quot; Mina said with an equal smile. 

&quot;So let&#39;s go,&quot; Tolaris suggested and they both stood up. They walked 
out from behind the boulder and casually made their way across the 
barren fields, Tolaris moving in proper military form and Mina moving 
like an over-excited child. 

When they reached the entrance way, the guard stepped forward and put 
out his hand. &quot;Sorry, sir, no unauthorized personnel are allowed in 
the complex at this time,&quot; he said crisply. 

Tolaris nodded towards the guard. &quot;I am escorting Lieutenant Maze&#39;s 
niece to see him in his quarters, Corporal, as per orders from the 
lieutenant.&quot; 

The guard briefly looked over Mina. She smiled happily, giving him her 
best charming look. The guard nodded to her and saluted Tolaris. 
&quot;Understood, sir. You may proceed.&quot; 

Tolaris returned the salute. &quot;Thank you, Corporal,&quot; he said and 
entered the complex with Mina. &quot;That wasn&#39;t too bad,&quot; he said to her 
when they were out of earshot of the guard. 

&quot;Who could resist a sweet and innocent girl like me?&quot; she giggled. 

&quot;Someone of Ra&#39;vel&#39;s species might have a different definition of 
sweet and innocent looking,&quot; he replied. &quot;Plus, we got lucky that the 
guard was a guy. Not too many females fall for the charming look from 
young girls.&quot; 

&quot;Well.... true....&quot; Mina admitted. &quot;Anyway, you might as well give me 
a quick tour of this place while we&#39;re walking so it looks like you&#39;re 
escorting me around.&quot; 

Tolaris nodded. &quot;Good idea,&quot; he said, and begin to explain the purpose 
and function of the section they were in. He kept up a running 
commentary of the various sections as they made their way deeper into 
the complex and up into the personal quarters region. 

It was highly obvious that there were very few Dragoons in the 
complex, a fact that made Tolaris more and more uneasy with each 
passing minute. His verbal tour of the complex was interrupted when 
Mina poked him in the shoulder. &quot;What?&quot; he said, slightly startled. 

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Mina asked quietly. &quot;You&#39;re starting to look spooked.&quot; 

Tolaris sighed. &quot;I&#39;m just wondering where everybody is. I&#39;ve been with 
the Dragoons for over five hundred years and I&#39;ve never seen the 
complex this empty, not even during the Mintaka campaign.&quot; 

Mina nodded. &quot;Look on the bright side. This is going to make our job a 
little bit easier.&quot; 

He stopped and gave her a dark look. &quot;That, of all things, worries me 
the most,&quot; he said, then continued walking down the corridor. He 
glanced around momentarily to gain his bearings and paused. &quot;Well, it 
looks like we&#39;re here. That fourth door up ahead is his.&quot; 

They both blinked at the door opened up and a figure came storming out 
and started walking down the hall towards them. Tolaris&#39;s blood ran 
cold as he recognized the long silvery hair and blank red eyes of 
Shar-Tei. Not knowing what else to do to avoid being recognized by 
her, he saluted as she approached. 

Shar-Tei was clearly preoccupied and distantly returned the salute, 
barely registering Tolaris&#39;s presence and entirely failing to notice 
Mina, who had edged herself slightly behind Tolaris. Tolaris blinked 
as he recognized the commander&#39;s insignia on her uniform. Not even 
pausing to exchange greetings, Shar-Tei continued on her way and 
disappeared from view as she turned a corner. 

&quot;Judging from the lack of color in your face, I&#39;d say you knew her,&quot; 
Mina said quietly. 

He nodded, still shaken. &quot;That was my former second-in-command. If she 
hadn&#39;t been so distracted, our cover would have been blown and we 
would have been in for it.&quot; He glanced around and noticed that Maze&#39;s 
door was still open. &quot;Come on, let&#39;s go before we get a second look.&quot; 

They cautiously walked up to the doorway and looked inside. &quot;Maze, you 
in there?&quot; Tolaris asked quietly. 

&quot;Come in and close the door, boss,&quot; was the edged reply. 

Tolaris and Mina exchanged glances before quietly entering the room. 
Maze was clad only in a pair of sweatpants and was doing pull-ups at a 
fast pace on the set of bars he had installed in his room. He barely 
glaced back to nod to Tolaris before refocusing on his exercises, 
failing to notice Mina&#39;s presence in the room. 

That fact was not lost on Mina. She quietly closed the door and turned 
to face Tolaris, an impish smile crossing her face. She giggled 
silently and laid a finger across her lips. Tolaris sighed quietly and 
nodded, not entirely sure why he was going along with her mischievous 
impulse. 

&quot;Did you get the data?&quot; Tolaris inquired. 

&quot;It&#39;s on the desk,&quot; Maze replied, still moving at his furious pace. 
&quot;You have any problems getting in here?&quot; 

Tolaris walked over to the desk in the far corner of the room and 
picked up the tiny information crystal and the portable reader next to 
it. &quot;No, it was rather easy since I was wearing lieutenant&#39;s stripes. 
Which is good, since I almost got run over by Shar-Tei.&quot; 

Both Tolaris and Mina blinked at the string of cuss words that Maze 
spat out following Tolaris&#39;s statement. When Maze was finished, he 
growled softly and increased the pace of his work. Mina watched with 
more than mild interest as the muscles of his back and shoulders 
rippled from the exertions. 

Tolaris knew that Maze tended to deal with frustrations by putting 
himself through an intensive workout. &quot;Maze, you&#39;re going to strain 
something if you don&#39;t calm down. Shar-Tei really got you that worked 
up?&quot; 

Maze sighed and slowed down. &quot;Partially. She was in here to find out 
why Ra&#39;vel was being stitched up in Medical, then chewed me out for 
screwing up the assignment. Like I could help that we got fired upon 
by those trigger-happy p&#39;tais in the Psi-Corp.&quot; 

Tolaris frowned as a thought occurred to him. &quot;What exactly did you 
tell them?&quot; 

&quot;We got delayed because we were clearing out a few campers in the 
target zone. The campers had just left the area when we got fired on.&quot; 

Tolaris put a few facts together in his head and found that they 
didn&#39;t add up. &quot;Wait a second. Who did you make your report to?&quot; 

Maze growled as he started working faster. &quot;General Rune.&quot; 

Another puzzle piece slid into place in Tolaris&#39;s mind, making the 
final picture darker than he had thought. &quot;Is Rune the other reason 
you seem intent on tearing a muscle today?&quot; he said mildly. 

The Dragoon lieutenant seemed to falter for a second before returning 
to a slower pace of work. &quot;No, it&#39;s not her....&quot; 

&quot;Then who?&quot; 

Maze fell silent, something which he rarely did whenever Tolaris asked 
him a question. Tolaris felt a hint of emotion behind Maze&#39;s 
unexpected silence and paused, not sure if he should probe deeper. He 
made a quick decision and spoke up. &quot;Maze, we&#39;ve known each other for 
almost forty-three decades. If something is bothering you, tell me.&quot; 

&quot;Well.... It&#39;s Sailor Venus, actually....&quot; 

Tolaris blinked and gave Mina a startled look. She seemed to be 
equally startled but she again laid a finger across her lips before 
tapping her chest. Tolaris didn&#39;t understand the meaning of the second 
gesture but nodded anyway. 

&quot;So what is it exactly about her that&#39;s got you so worked up?&quot; Tolaris 
asked gently. 

&quot;It&#39;s just that when I look at her, talk to her, touch her, I feel 
so.... so.... Well, that&#39;s it, I don&#39;t know what I feel.&quot; 

Tolaris thought carefully. &quot;Take a guess?&quot; he suggested. 

&quot;Well.... she&#39;s hot enough to make my pants itch, for one....&quot; 

The Dragoon commander sighed and gave Mina an apologetic look. She 
raised an eyebrow at the statement but remained silent. &quot;Maze, all the 
females make your pants itch, we both know that....&quot; 

&quot;But this is different, boss....&quot; Maze said as he swung himself 
upwards. He flipped around and hooked his legs between two bars. After 
making sure he was secure, he let go and hung upside down to do a 
series of sit-ups. &quot;It&#39;s not just sex this time.... I want to really 
get to know her, and I want her to get to know me.&quot; 

Tolaris blinked as he realized that his friend was serious. &quot;Sounds 
like you want to be friends,&quot; he said neutrally. 

&quot;No, you and I are friends. With her, it&#39;s.... more....&quot; Maze stopped 
in the middle of a sit-up and laid back. &quot;Tolaris, can I ask you a 
question? A personal question?&quot; 

Tolaris paused, not sure of how to handle the request. &quot;You can ask, 
but I can&#39;t guarantee an answer,&quot; he said slowly. 

&quot;What did it feel like when you fell in love with Sailor Mercury?&quot; 

The Dragoon commander suddenly felt the weight of seven hundred years 
of life pressing down on him and he sat down in the desk chair. He 
looked up to find Mina&#39;s curious gaze on him as well and sighed. 

&quot;I&#39;m not sure I can explain, Maze. When I met Ami, I didn&#39;t know she 
was a Sailor Scout. We just started talking and things fell into 
place. I don&#39;t know when I developed strong feelings for her, or her 
for me, but I just know that we wound up falling in love. I&#39;m sorry I 
can&#39;t define it further.&quot; 

Maze sighed and went back to his work in silence. Tolaris glanced up 
to find Mina smiling oddly at him. He gave her a curious look and she 
pretended to wipe a tear out of her eye. 

&quot;You know, boss, perhaps I just might be falling in love with her,&quot; 
Maze said suddenly. Tolaris blinked and glanced at Mina. Her soft blue 
eyes were wide with surprise and he could see a strange emotion 
stirring in their depths. &quot;However,&quot; he continued, &quot;I&#39;m not sure if 
she feels the same way about me.&quot; 

Tolaris opened his mouth to speak but was cut off when Mina spoke 
instead. &quot;Trust me, Maze, Sailor Venus feels the same way about you,&quot; 
she said quietly. 

Both Mina and Tolaris winced as a stunned Maze lost his anchor and 
fell to the ground with a loud thump. Almost instantly he was on his 
feet, looking around the room for the source of the new voice. &quot;Who 
are you?&quot; he demanded when he saw Mina. 

&quot;At ease, Lieutenant,&quot; Tolaris said softly. &quot;This is Mina, whom you 
know better as Sailor Venus.&quot; 

Maze froze and stared. &quot;Mina?&quot; he asked quietly. &quot;Is that really you?&quot; 

Mina nodded and slowly walked towards him. &quot;Who else would it be?&quot; she 
said softly as she hugged him. Maze instinctively returned the embrace 
and the two spend several seconds together in that position. 

Tolaris coughed lightly. &quot;If you two don&#39;t mind, I&#39;ll be heading back 
to the camp. Unless something goes wrong, we&#39;ll make our move as soon 
as the sun clears the horizon.&quot; 

Maze nodded. &quot;We&#39;ll be waiting for you, boss. We might be able to 
clear a path for you, if we plan things right.&quot; 

&quot;Very well, we&#39;ll see you in the morning then,&quot; Tolaris replied. 

&quot;Good night, Commander,&quot; Mina said. 

&quot;Night,&quot; he said and turned to leave. He paused as if to say more, 
then changed his mind and quietly left the room. Mina and Maze looked 
at each other with slight uncertainty as to what would happen next now 
that they were alone. 

&quot;So, where do we begin?&quot; Maze asked after a few moments of silence. 

Mina smiled shyly. &quot;Can we decide that in a few minutes? I really need 
to use the bathroom.&quot; 

Maze laughed and gestured towards a featureless door. &quot;In there.&quot; 

Mina gave him a quick hug and darted towards the bathroom. &quot;Thanks!&quot; 
she called out as she ran. She opened the door and stopped at what she 
saw inside. &quot;Ooooo, you have a shower, too,&quot; she squealed in 
excitement. &quot;Can I borrow that as well?&quot; 

Maze shrugged before returning to his exercises. &quot;Sure. You can use 
the towel on the left side of the rack. If you want to turn it into a 
steam bath, turn the green dial all the way over to the left.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said as she entered the bathroom and closed the door. 
Maze sighed quietly to himself as he tried to focus his mind on his 
work and not on the mental image of Mina in the shower. He sighed 
again as he realized that it wouldn&#39;t be an easy task. &quot;Why me?&quot; he 
muttered aloud as he started his exercise routine again. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Even before Tolaris reached the camp, he could tell something was 
horribly wrong. A sense of darkness gnawed on the edges of his soul, 
making him shiver lightly inside. Frowning in unease, he summonned a 
light fog bank to announce his presence and moved towards the camp. He 
hadn&#39;t taken five steps before a voice called out to him. 

&quot;Commander, that you?&quot; said the familiar voice of Sailor Jupiter. 

&quot;Yes. Who else would bring a fog bank with him?&quot; he said mildly. 

The mists parted to reveal Jupiter and Tolaris gasped at how haggard 
she looked. &quot;Jupiter, what happened? You look like you&#39;ve fought a 
demon.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;d be better of asking Captain Whisper first,&quot; she said in a 
strange tone. &quot;Come on, I&#39;ll take you to her.&quot; 

Tolaris frowned even more as she started walking back towards the 
camp. &quot;Miss Jupiter, what happened?&quot; he repeated. 

&quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about it, not now,&quot; she replied quietly. &quot;Just 
talk to Whisper first since she saw everything.&quot; 

He reached out and grabbed her wrist, forcing her to stop and face 
him. &quot;Leda, quit stalling and tell me what happened, now,&quot; he said in 
a tone laced with steel. 

Jupiter sighed and took a deep breath. &quot;Whisper finished her mind 
probe of the denizen and Ami got too hungry to wait for you to return. 
She went into a bloodlust after feeding off of him and turned on 
Sailor Moon. I&#39;m not sure what happened but she suddenly stopped 
feeding and starting screaming in pain. Rei had to use a ward to pin 
her down long enough for Whisper to mind-blast her into 
unconsciousness.&quot; 

Tolaris tried to move past her but she moved to block his way. 
&quot;Tolaris, you really need to see Captain Whisper first,&quot; she said 
quietly. He didn&#39;t say anything as he brushed past her, leaving her to 
return to her guard duties and to her own haunted thoughts. 

He entered the camp and looked around. The tents had been set up and a 
flickering light could be seen inside one of them. Tuxedo Mask was 
sitting in front of another tent and Sailor Moon was sitting in his 
lap sewing. He had his cape wrapped around her almost protectively and 
Tolaris blinked at the despondent look on her face. 

&quot;Commander, we need to talk,&quot; said Whisper from behind him. 

&quot;With all due respect, Captain, I need to see....&quot; 

&quot;Now, Commander,&quot; she interrupted darkly. 

The Dragoon sighed and leaned against a tree. &quot;Very well, Captain, 
what&#39;s on your mind?&quot; he said neutrally, slightly stressing her rank. 

Whisper nodded and sat down on apparently thin air. Tolaris knew that 
she often used her psychokinetic powers to form a mental chair for her 
to sit down when no other chair was available. 

&quot;Our little ambush party&#39;s orders were to confirm the presence of the 
Sailor Scouts at the outside edge of the Dragoon complex. They were 
also told to expect a rogue denizen to be assisting them. Those orders 
were personally given by General Rune herself,&quot; Whisper said darkly. 

She waited until Tolaris had finished cussing before continuing. 
&quot;There was an unexpected development, however. Shortly before they ran 
into us, they were delayed by an encounter with another denizen, a 
Felinoid warrior.&quot; 

Tolaris blinked. &quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;My question exactly. They came to the conclusion that he was the 
rogue denizen they were told to expect. They were totally surprised to 
see both you and me fighting against them.&quot; 

Tolaris sighed. &quot;So in short, not only are we going to be expected at 
the complex tomorrow, but we&#39;ve also got a true rogue running around, 
correct?&quot; 

Whisper nodded. &quot;Looks that way. However, we may still have the 
element of surprise. We still have Sailor Venus inside the complex, 
and that could make a difference. But you still need to be prepared in 
the morning for being caught in a trap.&quot; 

&quot;Of course. What else would we expect around here?&quot; he said dryly. 

They both chuckled for a moment before the surrounding situation sank 
back in. &quot;Captain....&quot; Tolaris said slowly. 

Whisper nodded. &quot;Yes, I know.&quot; She took a deep breath and remembered 
what transpired not too long ago. &quot;You want the short or the long 
version?&quot; 

&quot;Short, but make sure you don&#39;t leave out any significant details.&quot; 

&quot;Of course. Well, after I finished the probe, Sailor Mercury asked if 
it was okay if she could drain him. Jupiter wanted her to do what 
Venus suggested and wait until you got back, but she said that the 
blood loss earlier today was really getting to her. I didn&#39;t see any 
reason why she couldn&#39;t, so I told her that I was done and he was all 
hers.&quot; 

The telepath paused and shuddered lightly. &quot;I&#39;ll admit a bit of 
curiosity to the process, but what I saw was.... savage. Even those 
who knew how she fed before were shocked. It was a rather messy 
affair, to say the least, but what horrified us the most was the look 
in her eyes after she was finished with him and tossed him away like a 
rag.&quot; 

She took a calming breath and continued. &quot;Her eyes were full of hunger 
and were consumed with pure evil. She paralyzed all of us with her 
gaze and advanced on Sailor Moon. I&#39;ll never forget the way she smiled 
as Sailor Moon removed the ribbon around her throat and opened the top 
of her blouse.&quot; 

Tolaris placed a comforting hand on Whisper&#39;s shoulder as the telepath 
had to pause to regain her composure. &quot;I was surprised at how gentle 
she took her. They held each other like lovers and I swear Sailor Moon 
smiled as her throat was pierced. Mercury only took a few swallows of 
her blood before she jerked back and started screaming. She started to 
thrash about and we found that we could move again. 

&quot;Sailor Mars leapt forward with some kind of paper in her hand. She 
made a gesture towards Mercury with the paper and she froze. Someone 
yelled for me to try to calm her down so I stunned her with a weak 
mind-blast. She dropped like a lead weight and I&#39;m not sure if she&#39;s 
moved since.&quot; 

Tolaris frowned. &quot;Where is she now?&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;s in that first tent. Sailor Mars took one look at her and 
started talking in spiritual terms. She insisted that she should be 
the one to take care of her until you returned.&quot; 

The Dragoon blinked. &quot;Sailor Mars? I thought she&#39;d be the last person 
who would want to watch over Ami after what just happened.&quot; 

Whisper nodded. &quot;Everyone else was just as surprised. She got Jupiter 
to help carry her into the tent and promptly declared it off-limits. 
She tossed out Mercury&#39;s uniform and her own, asking someone to wash 
the blood off of the one and to patch up the holes in the other, and 
asked for a bowl of water and a clean cloth. I was told to have you 
see her after you saw me, but to make sure to remind you that neither 
of them are wearing much so you have to knock before you enter.&quot; 

Tolaris nodded, still puzzled at the recent turn of events. &quot;Thank 
you, Captain. Is there anything else I should know before I go check 
on Ami?&quot; 

She shook her head. &quot;No. I&#39;m going to go check on Ra&#39;vel&#39;s condition 
in Medical before I return to my quarters and see if I can&#39;t solve a 
few small puzzles.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you for everything, Captain,&quot; Tolaris said softly. 

&quot;Thank me when this is over, Commander. If we&#39;re still alive,&quot; she 
added and shimmered out of existence. 

He sighed and made his way towards the tent with the strange light 
inside. He changed directions slightly when Tuxedo Mask waved him 
over. &quot;How are you two doing?&quot; he asked when he approached. 

&quot;We&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Tuxedo Mask replied as he held out Mercury&#39;s suit. 
&quot;We managed to get the blood stains out, so you can give this back to 
her.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you.&quot; 

&quot;Commander....&quot; Sailor Moon said softly. 

Tolaris knelt down. &quot;How are you doing, Miss Moon?&quot; he asked, lowering 
his voice to match hers. 

&quot;I&#39;m okay. Here,&quot; she said as she held out Mars&#39;s suit. &quot;Everything is 
patched up.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m sure they both appreciate this,&quot; he said as he took the suit. 

Sailor Moon suddenly blinked and looked up at Tolaris, her soft blue 
eyes seeming to shimmer with emotion. &quot;Tolaris, it wasn&#39;t Ami&#39;s fault. 
It wasn&#39;t her. I can&#39;t explain what I felt when she bit me, but it 
wasn&#39;t her.&quot; 

Tolaris nodded and she suddenly seemed to withdraw again. Tuxedo Mask 
wrapped his cape around her even more and hugged her. The Dragoon 
silently stood up and walked towards the tent, his thoughts disturbed 
by Sailor Moon&#39;s strange behavior. 

&quot;Miss Mars?&quot; he called out when he reached the sealed entrance. 

&quot;Just a moment, Commander,&quot; came the slightly muffled voice. There was 
the sound of rustling fabric for a few seconds before she called out 
again. &quot;You can come in now, just seal the flap behind you.&quot; 

He unsealed the flap and stepped inside, resealing the flap behind 
him. He turned and stopped at the sight of Sailor Mercury laid out on 
a blanket next to a small firepit. Her clothing had been removed and 
was lying in a neat pile at the far end of the tent, leaving her clad 
only in her panties. Her body was covered in sweat and her face was a 
mask of pain. 

&quot;She&#39;s been like this since she fell unconscious,&quot; Mars said quietly. 
She was sitting next to Mercury, wearing only a light blanket wrapped 
around her. As she spoke, she dipped a cloth into a bowl of water and 
gently pressed it to Mercury&#39;s forehead. 

&quot;Here,&quot; Tolaris said as he handed her the two suits. &quot;What happened?&quot; 

&quot;Did Whisper give you the basics?&quot; she said as she burrowed beneath a 
set of heavy covers to get dressed. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; he said as he stroked Mercury&#39;s face. Her skin was burning hot 
to his touch and he summonned a cool breeze to try to lower her body 
temperature. 

Mars popped back up and finished buttoning her blouse. &quot;That won&#39;t 
help, Commander. The problem isn&#39;t physical, it&#39;s spiritual,&quot; she said 
quietly. 

&quot;Explain.&quot; 

&quot;When she drained the denizen, she seemed to go into a bloodlust of 
sorts. I thought I sensed a drastic change in her aura, as if it 
wasn&#39;t really her. When she paralyzed us, there was one brief moment 
when I could see everyone&#39;s aura as clear as day,&quot; she said, starting 
to shiver at the memory. 

&quot;Aura vision is a common skill to learn in the spiritual arts, Mars. 
When we get the time and chance, I&#39;ll try to teach it to you.&quot; 

She nodded. &quot;I could see Leda&#39;s aura was a bright green, Whisper&#39;s was 
a paler green, Darian was a soft pink, and Serena was pure white. But 
Ami&#39;s aura was a hideous mixture of her usual medium blue and a 
bizarre form of black. I could see those same auras again when she 
started draining Serena.&quot; 

She looked up and he could see tears starting to form in her eyes. 
&quot;All of a sudden, Serena&#39;s aura started to grow stronger and brighter. 
It lashed out and that&#39;s when Ami started to scream. Tolaris....&quot; she 
said, the tears falling now, &quot;It set her aura on fire. It was burning 
her soul away....&quot; 

He felt his chest burn as the realization sank in and his heart 
faltered for a moment. He looked down, trying to focus his mind enough 
to see auras. He succeeded only for an instant, but it was enough to 
see how faint Mercury&#39;s blue aura had become. 

&quot;I did what I could,&quot; Mars said, still crying softly, &quot;But nothing I 
do seems to work. I tried to use her computer to scan her, but I don&#39;t 
know what to do. Venus is the only other one who might have a clue as 
to how to work it, but she&#39;s not here. I can&#39;t even tell if she&#39;ll 
live or not....&quot; 

Tolaris focused his mind and laid a hand over Mercury&#39;s heart. He 
could tell her lifeforce was weak, but it wasn&#39;t in any danger of 
completely fading. He sighed as the damage to her spirit was revealed. 
It was fairly extensive and was certainly beyond his meager healing 
skills. 

&quot;She will live,&quot; he said as he took the cloth from Mars and started to 
bathe Mercury&#39;s sweat-soaked body. &quot;But there is nothing I can do. I&#39;m 
not sure there is anything that can be done,&quot; he said quietly. 

Mars nodded and took the cloth back. &quot;If you wouldn&#39;t mind, Commander, 
I&#39;d like to keep watch over her through the night. You need to plan 
our attack tomorrow and then get some sleep.&quot; 

Tolaris thought about arguing, but realized that she was right. He 
gave Mercury a gentle kiss before standing up and nodded to Mars. He 
quietly left the tent, making sure to seal the flap behind him. 

She sighed and returned to her tasks of tending to her friend&#39;s body 
and praying for her soul. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The door opened up behind Maze and he blinked as the room was 
instantly filled with steam. &quot;You know,&quot; he said slowly as he turned 
on the room vents, &quot;The idea is to keep the steam in the bathroom and 
not everywhere else.&quot; 

&quot;Sorry,&quot; giggled the voice from within the massive steamcloud. &quot;I 
didn&#39;t know how to vent it and I didn&#39;t want to be poking around with 
all of those controls in there.&quot; 

&quot;Wise decision, seeing how I&#39;ve got a few alarms and such wired into 
that panel,&quot; Maze said. He turned the vent fans up to maximum and the 
room started to clear quickly. He looked up at the doorway and 
blinked, first in surprise then in shock. &quot;Who are you?!&quot; 

Sailor V sighed and tapped her sandal against the ground. &quot;Must we go 
this every time we meet? I haven&#39;t changed, just my appearance. 
Venus&#39;s suit was covered with dirt and my normal clothes weren&#39;t in 
much better condition, so I had to go with my old Sailor V suit.&quot; 

Maze felt his blood slow to a crawl. &quot;Mina.... you&#39;re Sailor V?&quot; he 
said slowly, still in a state of shock. 

&quot;Yes, I am. This going to be a problem for you?&quot; 

&quot;No, but it will be for you if you&#39;re discovered. Tell me, is your new 
attitude part of the suit as well or are you always like this after a 
shower?&quot; he asked. 

V smiled and stretched. &quot;To be honest, it&#39;s a mixture, though I think 
a good portion of attitude comes with the suit. Believe me, when 
you&#39;re fourteen years old and fighting the Negaverse on your own, you 
need an attitude just to survive.&quot; 

She stepped closer to him and lowered her voice seductively. &quot;As for 
how I am after a shower, that remains to be seen,&quot; she said and 
removed her Sailor V Glasses. Her transformation reversed itself and 
she returned to being Mina. Maze&#39;s eyebrows hit the ceiling as he 
realized that she was now wearing just the towel he had let her 
borrow. 

&quot;Mina....&quot; he said slowly. 

She wrinkled her nose and giggled. &quot;Hold that thought and take a 
shower first. No offense, Lieutenant, but you smell like a dead gym 
bag.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you,&quot; he said sarcastically as he headed off towards the 
bathroom. He had gone inside and was closing the door behind him when 
Mina spoke up from behind him. &quot;Oh, and Maze?&quot; 

&quot;Yes?&quot; he said and turned his head just in time to see a vast expanse 
of dark blue fabric as the towel landed on his face. 

&quot;Hurry up,&quot; she said mischeviously and closed the door. 

Several minutes later, Maze emerged from the bathroom looking and 
smelling a great deal better than when he went in. He was wearing a 
clean pair of dark sweatpants and had his dark gray towel wrapped 
loosely around his shoulders. &quot;This better?&quot; he asked as he looked 
around the room. 

&quot;Come over here and let&#39;s find out,&quot; Mina said from the bed. 

Maze turned to look at her and blinked. She had taken off the top 
sheet of his bed and wrapped it around her slender body in a simple 
but efficient manner. She moved her arm languidly and he could see 
that the sheet was highly translucent in places, giving her the 
appearance of being wrapped in ethereal gauze. 

She moved her arms around, knowing full well what showed through and 
what didn&#39;t, and the effect it had on Maze. &quot;What exactly is this made 
of? I kind of like it,&quot; she said as she rubbed the silken fabric 
between her fingers. 

&quot;It&#39;s a combination of monomolecular filaments and our version of 
silkworm threads,&quot; he said as he sat down on the bed and picked up a 
small wire hanging on the edge of the bed. &quot;When you run an electrical 
current through it, it behaves like a sonic resonator.&quot; 

Mina blinked. &quot;Meaning...?&quot; 

Maze smiled. &quot;Meaning it does this,&quot; he said and brushed the exposed 
end of the wire across the silken threads. Her blue eyes went wide as 
the entire sheet started to vibrate in the ultrasound range and the 
sound waves rippled across her bare skin. 

&quot;Ooohhh, this feels good,&quot; she cooed as her entire body started to 
relax. 

Maze pulled the wire away from the blanket and the sheet quit 
resonating. He started laughing at the expression on Mina&#39;s face at 
having her relaxation interrupted so soon. 

&quot;Hey, put that back!&quot; 

&quot;Sorry, but it wasn&#39;t designed to be fully wrapped around a person. 
The sound waves would quickly start interfering with each other and 
the effects rapidly decline into unpleasantness,&quot; he said gently. 

Mina pouted and rubbed the fabric. &quot;So am I supposed to just lay on it 
or what?&quot; 

&quot;That or just let it rest on top of your body like any other sheet,&quot; 
Maze said. &quot;I use it on occasion to help work out sore spots in my 
muscles.&quot; 

&quot;A good massage might work better....&quot; she suggested. 

He laughed softly and brushed a stray lock of hair out of her face. 
&quot;But more often than not, I don&#39;t have anyone here to take care of 
that.&quot; 

&quot;But you have before, right?&quot; she said hesitantly. 

Maze paused to choose his words carefully. &quot;While it&#39;s no big secret 
that I&#39;ve had.... intimate company in the past, it was known and 
understood that nothing would become of it, and to this day nothing 
has aside from memories.&quot; 

Mina looked down at the silken sheet. &quot;I.... I see. And.... and what 
of what you said earlier.... about me....&quot; she said, her voice 
starting to quiver. 

She blinked as he gently tilted her head up to look at him. &quot;Our 
society is not one for soft emotions, Mina. Few of us can claim to 
know what true love feels like. I&#39;m not sure what love is, but right 
now I&#39;m feeling emotions that I&#39;ve never felt before until I met you. 

&quot;I won&#39;t say I know what it is to love, but I do know that what 
happened in my past was never touched by it. Yes, I&#39;ve had relations 
with other women, but we both knew it would only last for that night 
or until we tired of one another. We wouldn&#39;t have wanted it any other 
way for we didn&#39;t know if there could be another way. 

&quot;But for some reason, when I look at you and hold your hand, I start 
to feel strange inside. I want to know you, Mina, but I want it to be 
more than just another short relation in my past. I can&#39;t explain it, 
but I don&#39;t want to see you go, ever.&quot; 

Mina was lost in a sea of emotions. She started to search inward to 
find something that would help her say what she felt. Gone was the 
flippant and cocky attitude of Sailor V, or the sure confidence and 
decisiveness of Sailor Venus. Deep inside, there was only a young girl 
with the natural grace of an angel and a heart that knows no bounds. 

She leaned forward and hugged him tightly, ignoring the sheet as it 
slid down to her waist. &quot;Maze.... I love you....&quot; she said softly. 

Maze returned her hug with equal strength and felt something deep 
inside his heart explode. All of a sudden, things became totally clear 
to him and he realized for the first time in almost five hundred years 
what love felt like. &quot;And I love you, Mina....&quot; he said just as 
softly. 

She pulled back slightly and looked at him, not caring about her state 
of undress. &quot;Do you really?&quot; she asked. 

&quot;I understand now....&quot; he replied and kissed her. She returned the 
kiss with as much emotion and passion as she could and he in turn did 
the same, each second that passed adding more and more specialness to 
the moment. 

They lost track of time as they held each other and kissed, the 
Dragoon and the Sailor Scout exploring not only each other but their 
own feelings as well. Neither one knew when the moment slowly changed 
from love to passion, but they didn&#39;t care. Still holding each other, 
they slowly laid back on the bed and let their hearts tend to other 
matters of love. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Mars blinked as she registered motion inside the tent. Her mind 
quickly emerged from the depths of meditation and focused on her 
surroundings. She blinked again as she recognized the slender form of 
her visitor as she closed the tent flap. 

&quot;Serena, what are you doing here?&quot; she asked softly. 

The Princess turned around and smiled softly at Mars. &quot;I came to help 
my friend, Mars. I know now what ails Mercury and how I can help her,&quot; 
she said in her odd musical voice as she knelt down next to the fire. 

Mars blinked. &quot;What is it?&quot; she asked. &quot;I&#39;ve been trying to figure out 
what&#39;s wrong and I haven&#39;t come up with anything.&quot; 

&quot;It was difficult for me too until I changed into this form,&quot; she 
replied. &quot;I can understand a great deal more than Sailor Moon, but I 
also lack her inner strength of character.&quot; 

Mars blinked yet again, confused by the Princess&#39;s words. &quot;I.... don&#39;t 
get it. Aren&#39;t you one and the same?&quot; 

Serena smiled gently. &quot;No more than Rei and Sailor Mars are. We shall 
have to talk about that at a later time as Mercury needs my help.&quot; As 
the Princess spoke, she carefully cradled Mercury in her arms and 
lifted her head up to her neck. 

Mars blinked in shock. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; 

Serena paused. &quot;When Sailor Moon&#39;s blood was taken, her inner powers 
tried to protect her from the evil in Mercury&#39;s soul by trying to 
destroy it, and took part of Ami&#39;s soul with it. My blood can heal the 
damage and restore her soul.&quot; 

&quot;No! It was your aura and not your powers that did that!&quot; Mars 
protested. &quot;I saw it, I saw your aura gather together and burn her 
soul away....&quot; 

The Princess gave Mars a saddened look. &quot;It was only because her 
hunger consumed most of her soul. There was no way to separate her 
from that evil. But now the evil sleeps within her and while I can&#39;t 
rid her of it, I can fix the damage that was done.&quot; 

She didn&#39;t wait for Mars to try to reply before she leaned over and 
let her throat brush across Mercury&#39;s lips. Even only semi-conscious, 
Mercury&#39;s vampiric instincts were still functional and she started to 
search for a vein. She managed to quickly locate one and opened her 
mouth to bite down, the light of the fire gleaming off of her tiny 
fangs. 

Partially hidden in the shadows. Sailor Mars had a clear view as 
Mercury&#39;s fangs pierced Princess Serena&#39;s throat. She expected her to 
cry out as the soldier did when he was bitten, or even as softly as 
Sailor Moon did, but the Princess merely blinked before smiling 
softly. 

Mars&#39;s bottomless black eyes widened in surprise as both Serena&#39;s and 
Mercury&#39;s auras became visible, the one glowing a serene white and the 
other a dim medium blue. But even as she watched, Mercury&#39;s aura 
started to brighten and grow stronger. 

Serena only let Mercury take a bit of her blood before she slowly 
pulled away. Sailor Mercury made a soft whimpering sound at having to 
stop, but she complied and quickly slid into a natural sleep. Serena 
smiled at her friend and wiped up a few stray droplets of blood with a 
cloth before turning to face Sailor Mars. 

&quot;Of all of us, you alone have not shared your lifeblood with her. No 
one will ever hold that against you, for we all must make our own 
choices. But I ask that you consider it, Sailor Mars, for you would 
not just be sharing your blood, but your soul as well,&quot; Princess 
Serena said softly and quietly left the tent. 

Mars turned back to Sailor Mercury. Her fever was rapidly falling back 
to normal levels and she appeared to be at peace in her slumber. She 
pulled the covers over her friend and sat back to think about the past 
few minutes. She tried to meditate, but the Princess&#39;s word echoing in 
her mind wouldn&#39;t let her focus enough. 

Lost in thought, she continued to stare into the fire for the rest of 
the night, searching her soul for an answer that would let her 
conscience be at peace with her mind. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

She looked up from her meditations when she heard a voice calling her 
name outside the tent. &quot;Now what?&quot; she grumbled softly to herself as 
she glanced at Sailor Mercury. She was still fast asleep and showed no 
indication of wanting to wake up anytime soon. Lucky, Mars thought to 
herself as she stood up. I&#39;ll bet I haven&#39;t slept that solidly in a 
month. 

&quot;Mars, wake up,&quot; said Tuxedo Mask yet again. &quot;C&#39;mon, time for 
breakfast.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, yeah, we&#39;re moving, cape boy,&quot; she replied. &quot;I just need to get 
Mercury out of bed and we&#39;ll be ready.&quot; 

&quot;Umm.... Just make it quick, okay? Tolaris wants us knocking on the 
gates to the complex in less than an hour.&quot; 

&quot;Alright, now go away,&quot; she replied and turned to a task that she 
didn&#39;t look forward to, Waking up a vampire is probably not the wisest 
thing to do in this life, she thought. I just hope she wakes up in a 
better mood than Jupiter usually does. 

She blinked as Sailor Mercury groaned and sat up, holding one hand to 
her forehead. &quot;Well, good morning,&quot; Mars said quietly as she started 
to extinguish the tiny fire, grateful that she didn&#39;t have to wake her 
up. 

&quot;I think you&#39;re lying about the good part,&quot; Mercury replied fuzzily as 
she yawned. She grimaced and ran her tongue along the edges of her 
teeth. &quot;Ick, what did I eat? Tastes like....&quot; she said and froze as 
the memories of last night returned. 

Mars felt her heart falter slightly at the look of horror and despair 
on Mercury&#39;s face. &quot;Ami.... how much do you remember?&quot; she asked, 
knowing what the answer was from the look in Mercury&#39;s blue eyes. 

&quot;Everything....&quot; Mercury replied and started to shake. She looked up 
at Mars, her blue eyes brimming with tears. &quot;Rei.... what did I do? 
What have I become now?&quot; she said, her voice starting to shake as 
well. 

Mars looked down into the pit of ashes and sighed quietly. &quot;I don&#39;t 
think anyone can answer that for you since we don&#39;t know what happened 
to you. Only the Princess has an idea and even she&#39;s not sure of the 
specifics. You&#39;ll have to talk to her later, however, because we&#39;ve 
got work to do and soon.&quot; 

Mercury said nothing for several minutes, the memories of what she did 
continuing to plague her. She eventually stopped shaking and started 
to look around for the rest of her suit. She found it in the corner of 
the tent and proceeded to quickly get dressed. She was busy attaching 
her skirt bow when a packet of herbs was tossed in her lap and she 
jumped. &quot;What&#39;s this for?&quot; she asked Mars with a curious look. 

&quot;I want you to put them in your tea this morning,&quot; the priestess 
replied. &quot;You had a rough night last night and your energy reserves 
should practically be non-existent. Those herbs will help you regain 
most of your strength.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Mercury replied softly. She hesitantly sniffed at the 
herbs and blinked at the rather pleasant smell they had. &quot;Smells good. 
Should I ask what it tastes like?&quot; 

Mars gave her an apologetic look. &quot;Best guess is peppermint gone 
sour.&quot; 

Mercury blinked and looked at the herbs as if they had suddenly become 
an insidious form of poison. &quot;Ick.... sorry I asked.&quot; She sighed 
quietly and did her best to get her thoughts in order. &quot;Rei, about 
last night....&quot; 

Mars held up a hand to forestall her. &quot;I think I know what you&#39;re 
going to say, so don&#39;t. I would really rather not know why you did 
that because I might feel obligated to ensure you don&#39;t do it again.&quot; 

Mercury blinked. &quot;I&#39;m not sure I understand.&quot; 

Mars&#39;s voice grew soft as she knelt down next to Mercury. &quot;Ami, it is 
our duty as Sailor Scouts to protect the Princess first and each other 
second. I know it&#39;s a cold truth but we are fortunate it hasn&#39;t come 
down to the point where we have to choose. I value our friendship more 
than you would think, but I can&#39;t.... I won&#39;t allow you to attack 
Sailor Moon again, even if it&#39;s not by your choice.&quot; 

&quot;I understand,&quot; Mercury replied softly and stood up. She blinked as 
Mars gently grabbed her wrist. 

&quot;I don&#39;t want it to be this way, none of us do,&quot; Mars said quietly. 

&quot;I know,&quot; Mercury said and hugged Mars. Mars returned the embrace with 
warmth and the two spent several seconds comforting each other. 

&quot;Come on, I&#39;m hungry,&quot; Mercury said with a soft smile as they broke 
apart and started to pack up the tent. 

Mars blinked. &quot;Umm.... I would have thought you would be full 
after....&quot; she trailed off, not wanting to further upset Mercury. 

Mercury only smiled. &quot;I won&#39;t be that kind of hungry for awhile. I&#39;m 
talking about the solid food that the rest of me needs.&quot; 

Mars nodded and then blinked as her own stomach growled loudly. They 
both giggled and Mars smiled. &quot;I think I know what you mean. Jupiter 
should be up by now, so the sooner we get this taken care of, the 
sooner we can eat.&quot; 

In amazingly short order, the two girls cleared out the tent and broke 
it down into its component parts. They were busy trying to decide how 
to get the large tent canvas into the tiny tent bag when Tuxedo Mask 
walked up to them. 

&quot;Morning, you two. If you want to go eat, I can take care of folding 
the tent up. It looks tough, but Tolaris showed me a trick to it and 
it makes a sizable difference.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, sure, let us do the hard work and let you do the easy jobs,&quot; Mars 
teased as they headed towards the cooking fire. 

&quot;It worked, didn&#39;t it?&quot; he smiled and started to fold the tent. 

Mercury shrugged and looked around the camp. Tolaris was busy 
refolding his tent and Sailor Moon was still breaking down the last 
one. Sailor Jupiter was tending to a large pot of oatmeal with an 
equally large scowl on her face. None of them were morning people but 
Jupiter especially loathed getting up and out of bed, a fact not lost 
on Sailor Mars. 

&quot;Good morning, Grumpy,&quot; she said, intentionally being overly cheerful 
as they sat down and she scooped out a generous portion of oatmeal 
into a bowl. 

Jupiter&#39;s sarcastic and blunt reply caused Mercury to blush and Mars 
to choke on the oatmeal. The brunette snickered while Mercury gave 
Mars a solid thump on her back. Mars swallowed the oatmeal and gave 
Mercury an odd look. &quot;Can someone actually do that?&quot; 

Mercury shrugged and pulled out her computer. She typed away at a 
furious pace as she sought to create a simulation to answer the 
question. After a full minute, she shut her computer off and cleared 
her throat. &quot;It is possible, but only if you&#39;re double-jointed and 
your partner has a high tolerance for pain.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll skip that, thanks,&quot; Mars said as she coughed. 

Jupiter shrugged and passed a bowl of oatmeal to Mercury, giving her 
an odd look as she did so. Mercury paused with the spoon halfway to 
her mouth, looking at Jupiter look at her. &quot;What?&quot; 

Jupiter merely smiled and held out a brush. Mercury blinked and ran 
her free hand through her blue-tinted hair, frowning slightly as she 
realized that her hair was in tangles. She gratefully accepted the 
brush and proceeded to amaze everyone with her ability to eat with one 
hand while brushing her hair at a furious pace with the other. 

&quot;You make me sick,&quot; Mars said as she ate her oatmeal. &quot;I need at least 
two hands to brush my hair out and I swear it would still be difficult 
with three.&quot; 

&quot;An advantage to having short hair,&quot; Mercury said between mouthfuls. 
She blinked as someone took the brush out of her hand and started to 
work on her hair. She twisted around to see Sailor Moon smiling gently 
at her. 

&quot;Mars is right,&quot; the blonde said with a giggle, &quot;Your coordination 
makes me sick.&quot; 

Sailor Mars laughed. &quot;That&#39;s only because you can&#39;t even walk and chew 
bubblegum at the same time without tripping over your feet.&quot; 

Sailor Moon opened her mouth to deliver a retort when a sharp crack of 
thunder made everyone jump. As one, they turned and glared at Sailor 
Jupiter. 

&quot;Wow, Tolaris was right,&quot; she smirked as her lightning rod folded back 
down into her tiara, &quot;That really is an argument-stopper.&quot; 

&quot;I see you slept well,&quot; Mars said darkly. 

Jupiter blinked and feigned innocence. &quot;Sleep? What&#39;s that?&quot; 

Mercury frowned. &quot;You mean you didn&#39;t sleep last night?&quot; 

Jupiter snorted and waved a hand in the air. &quot;Nope, had too much on my 
mind. But don&#39;t worry about me, I&#39;ve still got plenty to keep me 
going.&quot; 

&quot;Is that because of the entire pot of coffee you drank last night?&quot; 
Tuxedo Mask said as he walked up to the group. &quot;If that&#39;s the case, 
you&#39;d better put another pot on the fire because it&#39;s going to be a 
really long day.&quot; 

Jupiter nodded. &quot;Already got the water boiling,&quot; she said, nudging a 
pot with her foot. &quot;Got water for coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and 
ma&#39;cha if you want it.&quot; 

&quot;Ma&#39;cha?&#39; everyone echoed uncertainly. 

&quot;Denizen&#39;s version of coffee,&quot; Tolaris said as he joined the group. 
&quot;If I understand human tastes correctly, it would taste like 
&#39;dishwater&#39; to you.&quot; 

Jupiter shrugged. &quot;Just because I thought it tasted like someone had 
done their dishes in it doesn&#39;t mean anyone else wouldn&#39;t like it.&quot; 

&quot;Umm, we&#39;ll pass, thank you,&quot; Mars said and Tuxedo Mask nodded. 

&quot;So what exactly are we going to do?&quot; Sailor Moon asked as she 
finished up brushing out Mercury&#39;s blue-tinted hair. 

&quot;Just as soon as everything is packed up and stashed away, we&#39;ll move 
in on the complex. When the sun clears the horizon. we make our move. 
If luck is with us, we should be in and out in less than an hour. 
Since the transport wards around the complex are one-way, we can open 
the wormhole to Earth from within the storage chamber. Since we now 
have three other members of our party to take into account, we will 
not be splitting up but going together as one, acquiring the first 
cargo and taking it with us when we go for the second.&quot; 

&quot;Sounds like fun,&quot; Jupiter said as she started pouring hot water into 
the cups. 

Tuxedo Mask shook his head slowly. &quot;One of these days we&#39;re going to 
have to sit down and discuss your idea of fun, Jupiter.&quot; 

&quot;Well, as one of my friends from karate class would say, I&#39;m just here 
to kick butt and chew some of Sailor Moon&#39;s bubblegum,&quot; she said. She 
leaned back with an evil grin and added, &quot;And we&#39;re all out of gum.&quot; 

That drew a round of chuckles from the group and Tuxedo Mask gave 
Jupiter a thumbs-up sign. &quot;Still, you think that&#39;s going to be 
enough?&quot; he asked. 

Tolaris shrugged and accepted a cup of steaming hot ma&#39;cha from 
Jupiter. &quot;Looks like we&#39;ll have to find out. Okay, everyone, final 
roll call. If you feel that you don&#39;t want to risk yourselves in this, 
speak now or forever hold your peace.&quot; 

No one made a sound and the Dragoon nodded in respect. &quot;Very well, 
then. Drink up and get ready to move in ten minutes.&quot; 

Everyone nodded and sipped their respective drinks, each wondering 
deep inside their mind if it might be their last. They finished in 
silence and quickly set about to their tasks, ready for what lay 
ahead. 

On the horizon, the leading edge of the red sun slowly rose into view. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

General Rune looked up as Commander Shar-Tei practically stormed into 
the general&#39;s private quarters. &quot;Fair morning, Commander,&quot; Rune said, 
slightly upset at the intrusion. &quot;What brings you here at this hour?&quot; 

&quot;With all due respect, General, I want answers,&quot; Shar-Tei replied. 
&quot;First of all, I want to know where ninety percent of my command is. 
Second, I want to know why one of my best lieutenants is over at 
Medical being held together with medical tape and Healer Maq&#39;i&#39;s 
regeneration ability. And third, I want to know why I feel like I&#39;m 
being set up for something.&quot; 

Rune laughed and absently ran her fingers through her dark hair. 
Shar-Tei blinked as she realized that Rune&#39;s hair was not black but a 
very deep shade of purple. 

&quot;Very well, Commander, you shall have the answers you seek,&quot; Rune said 
casually. &quot;Someone is indeed being set up, but it is not you. You are 
merely going to be the spring to my trap.&quot; 

Shar-Tei blinked and frowned. &quot;A trap? For whom?&quot; 

Rune leaned forward and smiled. &quot;Why, Commander Tolaris, of course.&quot; 
She ignored Shar-Tei&#39;s look of utter shock. &quot;Your command is not in 
the Outreaches but lying in wait not far from here. Your lieutenants 
Maze and Ra&#39;vel have joined forces with Tolaris and the Sailor Scouts, 
as have Captain Whisper of the Psi-Corp.&quot; 

&quot;What?!&quot; 

Rune continued speaking, ignoring Shar-Tei&#39;s outburst for the time 
being. &quot;I&#39;m afraid Ra&#39;vel will not make it, nor will Whisper when she 
checks in on her sometime today. As for Maze, his plan at easing the 
Sailor Scout&#39;s entrance into the complex will be put to a quick end. 
When Tolaris and those Scouts arrive, we&#39;ll be waiting for them. As 
soon as they enter, the Dragoon force will return and trap them inside 
the complex. I think you can figure out the rest on your own, 
Commander.&quot; 

Shar-Tei frowned and though quickly about the recent turn of events. 
&quot;If I may ask, General Rune, why was I not told about this before?&quot; 

Rune stood up and gave the Dragoon a measured look. &quot;This is not only 
a trap for Tolaris, but a test of your loyalty as well, Commander. I 
know about you and how you care for your former commander. Deep 
inside, even though you won&#39;t admit it to anyone or even yourself, you 
&#39;love&#39; Tolaris.&quot; 

Shar-Tei&#39;s featureless red eyes went wide with surprise and shock. 
&quot;How? How could you have known this?&quot; 

Rune laughed quietly. &quot;I know a great deal, Commander. I observe and I 
take notes. I didn&#39;t attain my rank by being inattenaive and stupid. I 
care little for your personal feelings, however. All I am interested 
in is your intentions to honor your oath of loyalty to me and to the 
NegaForce.&quot; 

Shar-Tei said nothing as she considered the situation. &quot;You said this 
was a test of my loyalty,&quot; she said at length. &quot;What must I do to 
prove myself?&quot; 

Rune nodded. &quot;Once we have the Sailor Scouts secured inside our trap, 
you will go confront them and challenge Commander Tolaris to a duel to 
the death.&quot; 

The Dragoon nodded as she became aware of the implications. If she 
won, she would be killing the one she cared about most for the sake of 
duty. If she lost, then she would have been considered weak and unfit 
to have retained her position as the commanding officer of the 
Dragoons. And if she refused to duel to the death, she would be 
disobeying an order and be arrested. 

&quot;I see,&quot; she said finally. &quot;I congratulate you on your plan, General. 
If something like this had been planned earlier, Queen Beryl might 
still be alive today and the Sailor Scouts no more than a bad memory.&quot; 

Rune smiled coldly. &quot;A pity she never sought to use my tactical 
skills. But that&#39;s the price one pays for not using your full 
resources. Unless you have any other matters to discuss, Commander, I 
suggest you return to your own quarters for awhile and try to relax. I 
don&#39;t know exactly when Tolaris will make his move, but I&#39;m sure it 
won&#39;t be long.&quot; 

&quot;As you wish, General Rune,&quot; Shar-Tei said with a formal bow and left 
the room, her heart heavy and her mind still working at a furious 
rate. 

&quot;Oh, yes, my dear Commander Shar-Tei,&quot; Rune said to the empty room, 
&quot;It certainly won&#39;t be long now....&quot; She settled back into her chair 
and started to laugh quietly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

&quot;I don&#39;t like this,&quot; Jupiter said quietly. &quot;Only two guards?&quot; 

Tolaris nodded and leaned back against the rock for a few moments. 
&quot;Keep in mind that we are in the middle of a heavily defended area 
that&#39;s geared more for large-scale assaults and missions rather than 
small strike teams. They simply don&#39;t need a large external guard for 
the complex since it mostly serves as a base for administrators.&quot; 

Tuxedo Mask blinked. &quot;But isn&#39;t this the central headquarters for the 
entire Dragoon division?&quot; 

The Dragoon nodded and smirked. &quot;Elite intelligence has never been 
what you would call a high priority for the Negaverse military.&quot; 

&quot;Isn&#39;t it so nice to be loved?&quot; Jupiter said as she looked at the 
guards again. &quot;So when do we get to take them out?&quot; 

Sailor Mercury activated the filter on her Virtual Visor and looked at 
the horizon. Anyone else looking at the dark red sun would have been 
blinded, but with the Visor&#39;s filter in place Mercury was able to see 
the very edges of the sun. 

&quot;The sun should clear the horizon any minute now,&quot; she told the rest 
of the group. 

Mars sighed. &quot;Let&#39;s just go and get this over with. I have very little 
patience.&quot; 

Jupiter nodded. &quot;Same here. I get dibs on the guard on the left.&quot; 

Sailor Moon blinked and giggled. &quot;I think you&#39;re too late, Jupiter. 
Take a look down there,&quot; she said and pointed. Everyone turned to look 
and Tolaris smiled. 

Lieutenant Maze was casually walking out of the entrance wearing a 
pair of standard-issue sunglasses. He turned to look at the horizon 
and said something to the guards. One guard nodded and said something 
that caused Maze to laugh. Maze gave the guard a friendly pat on the 
back before he got a solid grip on the guard&#39;s armor and rammed him 
into a stone pillar. 

The other guard lunged forward to attack but a bright beam of light 
lashed out from within the building and he dropped to the ground. Maze 
continued to bounce the first guard off of the pillar until he went 
limp and collapsed. The lieutenant then took a syringe out of his 
pocket and injected the unconscious guards with it. 

&quot;A little brutal, but I like it,&quot; Jupiter said as they scrambled down 
the small hill and ran across the barren fields. 

&quot;You would,&quot; Tuxedo Mask said with a smile. 

Maze finished his task and looked up. &quot;So, you&#39;ve returned,&quot; he said 
with a smile. &quot;Took you long enough.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, stuff it,&quot; Jupiter said. &quot;We&#39;re here on time. Besides, we had to 
come back to get Venus.&quot; 

&quot;Miss me that much?&quot; Venus said as she stepped out of her hiding place 
inside the complex. 

&quot;We just couldn&#39;t let you have all the fun,&quot; the brunette replied. 

Mercury unobtrusively moved to stand next to Venus and scanned her 
with her computer. She smiled slightly as she found what she expected 
and looked up at Venus. &quot;You look cheerful this morning,&quot; she said. 

Venus nodded. &quot;A steam bath does wonders for the spirits.&quot; 

&quot;Ooo, a steam bath!&quot; Sailor Moon squealed. &quot;I haven&#39;t had one of those 
in a long time. You enjoy it?&quot; 

&quot;Of course. I never had one before and it was better than I expected,&quot; 
Venus replied, giving Mercury a knowing wink. Mercury giggled and 
started to scan the unconscious guards. 

&quot;I&#39;ll settle for a regular bath right now,&quot; Jupiter said as she 
plucked at her chest bow. &quot;I probably smell like day-old road kill.&quot; 
She heard someone take a deep breath behind her and added, &quot;Open that 
mouth, cape boy, and I&#39;ll shove my fist down your throat.&quot; 

Tuxedo Mask quickly and wisely closed his mouth and settled on sighing 
softly. Sailor Moon giggled and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek. 

&quot;I hate to spoil this reunion, but we&#39;ve got to get moving,&quot; Tolaris 
said. &quot;Maze, what should we expect in the way of resistance?&quot; 

Maze glanced over at Venus and she nodded. &quot;Go ahead, tell him.&quot; 

Tolaris blinked. &quot;How bad?&quot; 

&quot;Well, we, umm, kind of jammed the lock on the fire door up on the 
third level and had to break it down, but everything else is clear 
down to the level above the secured storage rooms.&quot; 

Tolaris looked stunned. &quot;What? How did you manage that?&quot; 

Maze held up the syringe and grinned. &quot;Oh, we just gave everyone we 
could find a few cc&#39;s of anastapropaline.&quot; 

The Dragoon commander blinked and looked down at the two guards. &quot;I 
guess that means these two will be out for a while, then.&quot; 

Sailor Moon blinked. &quot;What&#39;s anasta.... whatever?&quot; 

Mercury passed her computer over the syringe and was marginally 
surprised at the results. &quot;According to my computer&#39;s analysis, it&#39;s 
morphine.&quot; 

Jupiter giggled. &quot;Ooh, the fun stuff. I used to know this girl who did 
morphine. Took 3 cc&#39;s and was zoned out for hours. We used to have all 
kinds of fun with her when she was like that. Fortunately for us, she 
usually didn&#39;t remember what went on.&quot; 

&quot;Should we bother asking what you did to her?&quot; Tolaris asked as the 
group made their way into the Dragoon headquarters complex. 

Jupiter shrugged. &quot;Not really, but I assure you nothing was harmful or 
remotely dangerous.&quot; 

&quot;Bet you&#39;d make a fun date,&quot; Tuxedo Mask muttered. He coughed lightly 
as Sailor Moon poked him in the ribs and glared at him. He merely 
shrugged his shoulders and she sighed to herself. 

&quot;Should we ask if you took any of that stuff?&quot; Venus asked, a small 
frown crossing her face. 

Jupiter snorted. &quot;Nope, never have and never will. I saw what it did 
to her and it made me shiver. We tried to get her to see someone about 
it but she wouldn&#39;t cooperate. I haven&#39;t seen or heard from her since 
I got transferred over to Crossroads Junior High.&quot; 

The group made their way down a long corridor that ended in a 
T-junction. Tolaris turned to go left but Maze reached out and grabbed 
his arm. &quot;This way, boss. We already got your stuff and it&#39;s sitting 
just outside the lower level stairwell.&quot; 

Tolaris frowned briefly. &quot;Are you sure you got everything?&quot; 

&quot;Well, it was already put neatly together in a small cargo container. 
A medium-sized transparent case with two life-crystals and eight other 
crystals, four racks of memory crystals with a dozen azure-banded 
crystals in each, a large book with silver filigree on the cover, your 
matched set of symipas and what appeared to be a hermetically sealed 
crystalline globe.&quot; 

Tolaris ran a mental checklist and paused. &quot;Lieutenant, say that last 
one again? A large globe?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah.... Something wrong, boss?&quot; Maze said hesitantly. 

Tolaris nodded, secretly delighted to hear about the globe. &quot;There 
just might be, but not with my.... globe. How many crystals total did 
you say were in the case?&quot; 

&quot;Ten, two life-crystals and eight others.&quot; 

Tolaris sighed. &quot;There should have been eleven. Do you remember if 
there was a dark purple crystal among them?&quot; 

Maze drew a blank and looked at Venus. She shook her and sighed. &quot;The 
only dark colored crystals I saw were the two life-crystals. 
Everything else was a light shade of something.&quot; 

The Dragoon commander said something beneath his breath and Maze 
blinked. &quot;Should I even ask what dialect that one was from?&quot; he asked 
cautiously. 

&quot;Ancient Eastern Frontier.&quot; 

Maze snorted. &quot;Your accent is horrible, then.&quot; 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;Sorry if I was raised in the Southern Flatlands.&quot; 

&quot;Anyway, do you want to go try to find that missing crystal?&quot; Maze 
said. 

&quot;Where ever it might be, it wouldn&#39;t be in that storage area. I have 
this feeling that we&#39;ll find the crystal when we find Nephlyte&#39;s Star 
Crystal.&quot; 

Maze nodded. &quot;Alright, let&#39;s go then,&quot; he said, gesturing towards the 
right-hand corridor. 

&quot;You know,&quot; Mars said as they turned a corner and entered the 
stairwell, &quot;This is starting to spook me. If everyone in this area is 
drugged up, why hasn&#39;t someone from one of the other areas noticed 
this by now?&quot; 

Mercury nodded. &quot;And where is everybody?&quot; 

Sailor Venus giggled. &quot;We stuffed them in bathrooms and broom closets 
to keep them out of everyone&#39;s way.&quot; 

&quot;How thoughtful,&quot; Jupiter snickered. 

&quot;Sailor Mars has a point,&quot; Tolaris said. &quot;Even if this place is 
running on a minimal staff, someone should have discovered something 
by....&quot; He winced as a loud klaxon began sounding throughout the 
complex. 

&quot;You were saying?&quot; Tuxedo Mask said with an ironic grin. 

&quot;I&#39;m saying we&#39;ve got to get down to the secured storage area before 
they drop the protective bulkheads or we&#39;ll be in some serious 
trouble,&quot; Tolaris replied and increased his pace down the stairs. 

&quot;Sounds like it&#39;s too late, boss,&quot; Maze said as a heavy sound 
reverberated through the stairwell. 

They ran down the stairs as fast as the could, Tolaris keeping up a 
litany of curses beneath his breath the entire time. Just as they 
approached a large landing, a heavy thump shook the stairwell and 
Tolaris said a word that needed no translation. 

&quot;Missed it by that much,&quot; the Dragoon commander growled as he glared 
at the dark gray bulkhead. 

Sailor Moon blinked and looked at the bottom of the ultraheavy door 
frame. &quot;Not quite. Looks like something&#39;s wedged in at the bottom.&quot; 

Tolaris blinked and looked down. The cargo container had gotten wedged 
between the bulkhead and the frame, leaving a gap of several inches. 
&quot;I knew those containers were tough, but I didn&#39;t know they could hold 
up against a security bulkhead.&quot; 

Maze frowned. &quot;You know, I could have sworn I left that in the corner 
and not in the doorway.&quot; 

&quot;I know you left it in the corner,&quot; Sailor Venus said with an equally 
dark frown. &quot;Can those things move on their own?&quot; 

Tolaris laughed. &quot;No, they can&#39;t. I think I know how it moved, but 
I&#39;ll explain later. First thing we need to do is get this bulkhead up 
high enough for us to get under it.&quot; 

&quot;How heavy is it?&quot; Jupiter asked. 

&quot;Two tons,&quot; Tolaris said. 

&quot;Funny,&quot; the brunette said and sighed. 

&quot;Can we try blasting it down?&quot; Sailor Mars asked as she tapped the 
heavy bulkhead. She glared at Maze and sighed. &quot;It was just a 
suggestion, so you can stop laughing now.&quot; 

&quot;Sorry,&quot; he said, still chuckling quietly to himself. 

&quot;Umm, Mercury? What are you doing?&quot; Sailor Moon asked. 

Sailor Mercury was scanning the ceiling and door frame with her 
computer and Virtual Visor. &quot;I&#39;m trying to find the mechanism that 
moves this thing. If it can be ordered to be lowered, it can be raised 
as well.&quot; 

Tolaris sighed quietly. &quot;Sorry, it&#39;s on a closed circuit so it can&#39;t 
be opened from an outside signal.&quot; 

&quot;The door control is on a closed-circuit but the maintenance controls 
are on an open frequency,&quot; she said as she started typing away. 

Tolaris gave Mercury an odd look. &quot;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re attempting to 
reprogram the maintenance codes. The operating system is nothing like 
you&#39;ve ever seen before.&quot; 

&quot;But I have,&quot; she replied, still typing rapidly. 

Everyone blinked and looked at their blue-haired friend. &quot;When was 
this?&quot; Tolaris asked, slightly stunned. 

&quot;Last week. I took a study break and poked around for a bit on 
Nephlyte&#39;s computer back in the cathedral. It took me a bit to figure 
out the language but the syntax is rather simplistic,&quot; she said 
distantly as she typed. She recompiled the program and nodded at the 
results. &quot;Okay, everyone stand back from the bulkhead for a bit.&quot; 

She waited until everyone had backed off before she told her new 
computer program to run. A loud humming sound filled the stairway as 
the framework was charged with an electrical current. But because the 
bulkhead wasn&#39;t completely closed, a full circuit couldn&#39;t be 
completed. 

Sailor Moon shivered as the intensity of the electric field made the 
hairs on her arms stand up. &quot;Geez, Mercury, are you trying to 
electrocute us?&quot; 

Mercury shook her head, watching her computer monitor intently. &quot;No, 
what I&#39;m doing is proving to the maintenance computer that this 
bulkhead needs to be serviced and to open it up for repairs. We&#39;re 
fortunate that it didn&#39;t close all the way. Otherwise, it would be 
blocking my signal and I wouldn&#39;t have been able to try this.&quot; 

Everyone blinked as the bulkhead quit humming and started to raise 
back up into the ceiling. &quot;It won&#39;t be long before the master computer 
figures out what we&#39;re up to and lower the door again, so move 
quickly,&quot; Mercury said as she put her computer back into her 
dimensional pocket. 

Everyone nodded and got ready. There was barely a two-foot clearance 
when Sailor Venus rolled herself under the bulkhead and into the 
corridor. Almost instantly she was on her feet, scanning the corridor 
for any sign of activity. She made an all-clear gesture and Jupiter 
rolled into the corridor, followed by Sailor Mars and Lieutenant Maze. 

The bulkhead was just high enough to allow Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask 
to crouch down and enter the corridor when it stopped briefly and 
started to lower back down. Tuxedo Mask cussed and hastily moved out 
of the way to give Mercury enough space to roll under the bulkhead and 
into the corridor. Tolaris made sure everyone else was clear before he 
rolled under the bulkhead, grabbing the cargo container as he did so 
and dragging it with him. 

The bulkhead closed with a heavy thump that shook the corridor. &quot;Well, 
so much for getting out this way,&quot; Maze said as he leaned against the 
wall for a brief moment. &quot;Next question is which storage room are we 
looking for? There are several of them on this level.&quot; 

Tolaris blinked. &quot;You mean you couldn&#39;t find out?&quot; 

Venus sighed. &quot;We checked the cargo lists carefully but it didn&#39;t 
mention specifics. It just said it was in secured holding on this 
level.&quot; 

&quot;So where should we start?&quot; Mars asked. 

Mercury blinked and held up her hand. &quot;Everyone stop talking for a 
bit, I think I hear something.&quot; Everyone complied and she listened 
intently. It was a very soft sound but it was also rather familiar. 
&quot;Sailor Moon.... I think I hear your Crescent Moon Wand beeping....&quot; 

Everyone turned to Sailor Moon and she blinked at the sudden 
attention. She reached into her Lunar Space pocket and pulled out her 
Crescent Moon Wand. The Wand was beeping softly to itself and Sailor 
Moon felt it start to pull ever so slightly in one direction. 

&quot;What gives?&quot; she blinked, studying the Wand carefully. &quot;I thought it 
was only supposed to home in on the Rainbow Crystals.&quot; 

&quot;Could it be reacting to Nephlyte&#39;s Star Crystal?&quot; Mercury suggested. 
&quot;It was also set to look for the Rainbow Crystals.&quot; 

Jupiter shrugged. &quot;We might as well see where it leads since no one 
else has suggested a place to start.&quot; 

Tolaris nodded. &quot;Good enough. If you&#39;ll take the lead, Sailor Moon, we 
can get going.&quot; 

Sailor Moon nodded and let the Wand pull her hand around until she was 
pointing it down the corridor. &quot;This way,&quot; she said and they started 
moving. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The cargo door was every bit as massive as the security bulkhead. 
Painted on it was a warning written in the spidery symbols that made 
up the written denizen language. Sailor Moon glanced down at her 
Crescent Moon Wand to make sure that this was where it was trying to 
take her. 

&quot;Well, this looks like the place,&quot; she said nervously. 

Tolaris sighed and set the cargo container down on the floor, 
muttering something beneath his breath. Mercury blinked and gave him 
an odd look. &quot;Who needs to lose some weight?&quot; she asked. 

&quot;Nothing, just thinking aloud,&quot; Tolaris replied. &quot;Secured Storage 
Area, Level 6 Protocols Required For Access.&quot; 

Venus ran her fingertips along the writing on the door. &quot;That what 
this means?&quot; 

&quot;Yes,&quot; the Dragoon commander replied and stepped up to the control 
panels. He punched a few buttons and was surprised when the reinforced 
doors started to slide back into the walls. &quot;This worries me. I 
thought they are supposed to change the protocols every time a new 
Dragoon commander is appointed.&quot; 

Maze shrugged. &quot;Yeah, but you&#39;re supposed to be frozen in crystal, 
which for all intents and practical purposes, means you&#39;re dead. It&#39;s 
hard to obtain the protocols from a dead Dragoon. Changing protocols 
is time-consuming so they probably just gave Shar-Tei the currents 
protocols.&quot; 

Tuxedo Mask snickered. &quot;Don&#39;t you just love bureaucracy?&quot; 

&quot;For the first time in five hundred years, yes,&quot; Tolaris replied with 
a small smile. He picked up the cargo module and stepped into the 
storage area, the rest of the group following behind him. Once 
everyone was inside and clear of the doorway, the automatic sensor 
quietly closed the door behind them. 

&quot;Relax, it&#39;s supposed to do that,&quot; Maze said as the Sailor Scouts all 
cast nervous glances at the door. &quot;Leaving a secured room open is not 
wise.&quot; 

Sailor Mars looked around the area and shivered. &quot;I don&#39;t know about 
the rest of you, but something about this place gives me the creeps.&quot; 

The walls were lined with various-sized cargo containers. Several 
large hexagon-shaped modules were stacked in a group at the far end of 
the room. The only light came from a single spotlight, aimed down at a 
small stone pedestal. Resting on the pedestal were two crystals, a 
dark purple shard and a crystal that was as black as night. 

Sailor Moon slowly walked over to the two crystals, the Crescent Moon 
Wand beeping louder as she approached. She blinked in confusion as the 
Wand zeroed in on the purple crystal instead of the crystal she 
recognized as Nephlyte&#39;s Star Crystal. 

Mercury blinked. &quot;Why is it going for that crystal instead of the Star 
Crystal?&quot; 

Tolaris opened his mouth to say something but remained silent as a low 
hum filled the room. Sailor Moon stepped back as both the Imperium 
Silver Crystal and the purple crystal started to resonate. Everyone 
blinked as the purple shard started to emit a stream of dark motes 
that quickly coalesced together into an armored being. 

His armor covered him from head to toe and appeared to have been 
forged out of an odd blue metal. The plates on his shoulders, back, 
and elbows had been reinforced with several short and stubby spines, 
giving his armor an evil look. His helmet covered most of his head, 
showing his face from the bridge of his nose down to just below his 
chin. But the most sinister-looking feature of his armor was the way 
the lenses on his visor were electronically tinted white, giving him 
the appearance of having pupilless eyes. 

&quot;Who are you that could have awakened me again?&quot; he said slowly in a 
deep voice. &quot;How is it possible that I still live?&quot; 

Tolaris started to shake as he recognized the ancient armor and the 
small sigil etched into the shoulder plates of the being. &quot;Is it 
possible?&quot; he said slowly. &quot;Can you really be Captain Raijen?&quot; 

The being nodded. &quot;I am he. Who are you that knows my name?&quot; 

Tolaris bowed formally. &quot;I am Dragoon Commander Tolaris, formerly the 
commanding officer of the Dragoons before my exile.&quot; 

Raijen frowned slightly. &quot;So the Dragoons still exist after all. Can 
you tell me if it&#39;s still a division spoken of with pride?&quot; 

Maze nodded. &quot;It is, sir. I am Dragoon Lieutenant Maze,&quot; he said with 
a bow. &quot;The name Dragoon has always been a name of respect and pride 
and still is to this day.&quot; 

Raijen nodded and relaxed slightly. &quot;Good news indeed. Commander, I am 
hesitant to ask, but why have you been exiled?&quot; 

&quot;I was sent to Earth on a mission and fell in love with a young girl 
who turned out to be one of the warriors Queen Beryl had declared as 
enemies,&quot; he said, nodding towards Sailor Mercury. 

The ancient Dragoon looked at Sailor Mercury and the optics in his 
visor blinked, obviously mimicking the movements of his eyes. &quot;Can 
this be? Are you one of the Sailor Scouts?&quot; he asked Mercury. 

Everyone blinked in surprise. &quot;Yes, I am....&quot; Mercury said hesitantly. 
&quot;Do you know of us?&quot; 

&quot;Yes. I have been revived once before, a long time ago. I was 
introduced to a group of female warriors who wore suits similiar to 
yours. They called themselves the Sailor Scouts and served their 
kingdom faithfully.&quot; 

&quot;You know about the Moon Kingdom?&quot; Sailor Moon asked incrediously. 

Raijen turned to look at her and froze. &quot;Yes, I remember it being 
called that. You.... remind me of someone I once knew back then.&quot; His 
gaze fell to the Crescent Moon Wand and his visor-eyes widened in 
shock as he recognized the glittering crystal secured to the base of 
the crescent. 

&quot;The Imperium Silver Crystal? But I thought only the Royal House was 
able to wield it....&quot; He looked up at her and blinked. &quot;Tell me, 
child, who was your mother?&quot; 

&quot;Queen Serenity of the Moon Kingdom,&quot; she replied. 

Captain Raijen&#39;s hand started to shake ever so slightly. &quot;Serenity...? 
And what of your father?&quot; 

Sailor Moon looked down at her Wand. &quot;I never knew who my father was 
and Mother would not speak of him. She only said that he was a kind 
and gentle man and that he would have sacrificed everything to have 
been able to remain with her.&quot; 

&quot;Is it possible...?&quot; Raijen said slowly as Sailor Moon looked up at 
him. His visor went dark as he reached up and removed his helmet. She 
gasped as his shoulder-length blonde hair came loose from his helmet 
and he looked at her with bright blue eyes. They locked gazes and he 
slowly fell to one knee before her. &quot;Serenity, why didn&#39;t you tell 
me?&quot; he whispered to the open air. 

&quot;How could I have?&quot; came the musical voice of Queen Serenity. Everyone 
blinked as the Imperium Silver Crystal started to glow and the image 
of Queen Serenity formed in the room. &quot;By the time I knew I was with 
child, your spirit had already been forced back into the crystal and 
vanished.&quot; 

&quot;Mother...?&quot; Sailor Moon said. &quot;What&#39;s going on? Who is he?&quot; 

Serenity laughed, a delicate golden sound that caused Raijen to smile 
in an odd sort of way. &quot;Oh, Serena, you still haven&#39;t changed a bit, 
still asking questions about everything. He is who he says he is, the 
Captain and founder of the Negaverse Dragoons.&quot; She took a deep breath 
and laid a comforting hand on Sailor Moon&#39;s shoulder. &quot;He is the man I 
fell in love with a thousand years ago in the Moon Kingdom.... and is 
also your father.&quot; 

Silence fell around the room like a cloak. Tolaris took one look at 
the expression on Sailor Moon&#39;s face and gently kicked the cargo 
container across the room. It slid across the floor and came to a stop 
just behind Sailor Moon. She nodded her head in thanks and sat down, 
her eyes never leaving Raijen&#39;s. 

&quot;My father...? Mother, why didn&#39;t you ever tell me about him?&quot; 

Serenity sighed, sat down next to her daughter and smiled sadly at 
Captain Raijen. &quot;Serena, I had to protect his identity because there 
were a few spies from the Negaverse in our kingdom. If they had known 
that I was told about Queen Beryl and the NegaForce, they would have 
attacked immediately and the damage would have been far more 
extensive. Becuase of Raijen, we were able to slowly and quietly 
prepare for the Negaverse attack for fifteen years.&quot; 

Tuxedo Mask blinked and slowly walked next to Sailor Moon. &quot;You mean 
you knew about the attack before it happened?&quot; 

Serenity nodded slowly. &quot;Yes. I tried to discreetly warn Earth about 
it but no one would listen, and I couldn&#39;t be more vocal about it for 
fear of letting the spies know about it.&quot; 

&quot;Mother, will you explain to us what happened before the attack?&quot; 
Sailor Moon asked softly. Tuxedo Mask laid his hand on her shoulder 
and she leaned back against him, seeking comfort. 

&quot;It all started back in the Silver Millennium when a small scouting 
party from the Negaverse arrived under the guise of a diplomatic 
delegation,&quot; Queen Serenity said. &quot;One of them brought with him a 
strange purple shard that he believed was a good luck talisman. For 
reasons I&#39;m still not sure of, the Imperium Silver Crystal was able to 
sense the spirit locked away inside and decided to free it for a 
while....&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Raijen had been wandering around the palace for some time now, looking 
for the person who had his crystal. He wasn&#39;t sure how or why he had 
been animated two thousand years after his death, but he had been 
fully aware of what was transpiring. 

This is a beautiful place, he mused as he continued walking along. 
This can&#39;t be from the Negaverse. I wonder where this is? He paused 
momentarily as he heard a gentle voice talking softly to someone. The 
voice was feminine and rather musical, a sound that the Dragoon found 
to be very pleasing. Curious, he started to follow the sound to its 
source. 

&quot;...and I know she has never been overly strong or healthy, but I&#39;ve 
never seen her this ill before. Mercury is doing all she can for her, 
but even she can&#39;t explain the sickness,&quot; said the voice sadly. 

Raijen paused as he came upon a secluded balcony. Sitting on a 
pillowed bench was a lovely young woman with soft lavender hair. She 
had it pinned up in a style he had never seen before, forming two 
spherical buns on her head that ended in ankle-length streams of hair. 
She was gently stroking a rather heavily pregnant gray cat while 
staring out into the evening sky, looking at a large blue planet. 

The Dragoon blinked in surprise as the cat stretched and spoke. &quot;Do 
you think it&#39;s possible that it could be something like a cold hitting 
her harder than it would other people? She is rather prone to 
illness.&quot; 

The lady sighed and looked down at her cat. &quot;No, I fear this time it&#39;s 
something else, something far worse than a mere headcold. Otherwise I 
think that Mercury could have identified it by now. Still....&quot; She 
paused briefly and looked up. She blinked in surprise when she saw the 
armored figure quietly standing in the doorway. &quot;Yes?&quot; 

Raijen bowed. &quot;Forgive me, my lady, I didn&#39;t mean to intrude or 
disturb you....&quot; 

Serenity smiled at him. &quot;You aren&#39;t disturbing me and I could use the 
company right now. Tell me,&quot; she said, tilting her head at a slight 
angle. &quot;I don&#39;t recall ever seeing you before. Who are you?&quot; 

&quot;I am Dragoon Captain Raijen, my lady.&quot; 

&quot;A captain? Surely not one of my captains,&quot; she said with a slight 
frown. 

Raijen shook his head slightly. &quot;No, my lady, I am part of the escort 
for the diplomatic delegation from the Negaverse.&quot; He disliked having 
to create a cover story for his presence, even if it was partly true. 

&quot;I see....&quot; Serenity said with another smile. &quot;My name is Serenity and 
this is Diana.&quot; 

&quot;How do you do?&quot; Diana said with a nod of her head. 

&quot;I am doing quite well, actually, Lady Diana. May I inquire how your 
pregnancy is coming along?&quot; 

The cat chuckled and stretched again. &quot;It&#39;s coming along, alright. I&#39;d 
say they&#39;ve got another week to enjoy it before they have to come out 
and join the rest of the world.&quot; 

Serenity smiled. &quot;Which means I&#39;ll have to put up with you complaining 
about midnight feedings for a month,&quot; she teased. 

&quot;Would you rather listen to Uranus and her newborn?&quot; Diana shot back. 

&quot;Not really,&quot; Serenity said hastily and Raijen laughed quietly. She 
gave him an amused look and laughed as well. &quot;Tell me, Captain, what 
brings you to this part of the castle?&quot; 

&quot;I was just wandering around and seeing what there is to see. My 
services are not needed at this time so I have been granted permission 
to do as I will as long as I check in every now and then,&quot; he said 
evenly. 

&quot;I see.... Then will you be able to come to the ball tonight?&quot; 
Serenity asked with a soft smile. She found herself starting to become 
attracted to the Dragoon, a concept she rarely had to deal with 
before. She felt a bigger smile tugging on the corners of her mouth as 
his blue eyes widened slightly. 

&quot;I.... really don&#39;t know how to dance, Lady Serenity, and I wasn&#39;t 
told to bring any sort of formal wear,&quot; he said hesitantly. 

Serenity laughed, a delicate sound that seemed to put the Dragoon at 
ease. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Captain, as our guests I&#39;m sure we could arrange 
to provide you with the proper attire. As for learning to dance, I 
could teach you.&quot; She did her best to ignore the slightly stunned look 
on Diana&#39;s face at her offer. 

Raijen started to sweat inside his armor and tried to think of a way 
he could gracefully decline. He started to form a reply when there was 
the sound of something splashing into the fountain in the courtyard 
below. Almost instantly a high-pitched cry rose up and Diana leapt up 
onto the railing, not an easy task with her considerable bulk. She 
blinked as she saw what happened and her fur stuck straight out. 

&quot;Serenity, Artemis has fallen in! He&#39;s only a kitten and can&#39;t swim! 
We have to do something or he&#39;ll drown!&quot; she said in a panic. 

Serenity turned to run for the stairs but stopped when Raijen hastily 
took a step forward and unclipped his helmet from the hook on his 
belt. &quot;I&#39;ll get him,&quot; he said and locked his helmet into his armor 
collar. Serenity gasped and stepped back as his visor-eyes started to 
glow white, giving him a slightly demonic appearance. 

Raijen took two steps forward and leapt, easily clearing the railing 
and landing down in the courtyard below. Serenity stepped up to the 
edge of the balcony and looked down, not believing that he had managed 
to effortlessly land on the ground some twenty feet below. 

The Dragoon used his momentum to take a smaller hop into the fountain, 
landing with a surprisingly small splash and scooping up the kitten in 
a single motion. He quickly jumped out of the fountain and tucked the 
kitten into the crook of his arm. He then got a short running start 
and leapt up into the air. 

Serenity blinked as the Dragoon landed on the edge of the balcony with 
a heavy thump. She started to move forward to help him but he shot her 
a look and she froze. 

&quot;Stay back,&quot; he commanded. 

&quot;But what....&quot; she started to say. She blinked as there was a spark 
from one of the joints in his leg armor and a cloud of dark green gas 
was vented. Raijen waited until the gas dissipated before sighing 
heavily and carefully setting the kitten down on the ground. 

Diana immediately rushed forward to check out the kitten. His white 
fur was thoroughly soaked and he was still trying to get the last bit 
of water out of his lungs. &quot;Artemis, are you alright? Can you talk to 
us?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll.... I&#39;ll be okay....&quot; he said between coughs. 

&quot;Diana, please take him to the medical ward and have Venus look him 
over. I&#39;d ask Mercury but she&#39;s busy tending to Saturn,&quot; Serenity said 
as she stroked Artemis&#39;s fur. 

&quot;Of course, Queen Serenity,&quot; the cat replied and Raijen blinked. 

Artemis managed to clear his lungs of the last bit of water and 
promptly let loose with a sneeze. &quot;Can&#39;t,&quot; he said weakly. &quot;As I was 
coming to tell you, Neptune is finally in labor. Pluto is watching 
over Saturn while Mercury, Mars, and Venus are helping Neptune with 
the delivery. Unfortunately, Mercury thinks this is going to take 
several hours so you don&#39;t have to hurry over or anything.&quot; 

Serenity smiled. &quot;I was wondering when she would get around to having 
her child. Thank you for the information, Artemis, but I still want 
you checked out in medical.&quot; 

Artemis nodded and blinked as Diana picked him up by the scruff of his 
neck. &quot;Come alone, let&#39;s go,&quot; she managed to say, despite having her 
mouth full of white fur. She slowly walked off, not being able to move 
very fast due to her pregnancy. 

Serenity turned back to Raijen and frowned lightly. &quot;Captain, are you 
alright?&quot; 

&quot;Of course, your Majesty,&quot; he said as he knelt down to inspect his 
armor joint. &quot;The joint must not have been sealed properly and the 
water shorted out the booster.&quot; 

Serenity felt her insides twinge at the note of formality that had 
crept into his voice. She found herself wishing yet again that she 
wasn&#39;t a queen and could at least try to pursue a friendship. 
&quot;Captain, if I may ask you, how were you able to make those kind of 
jumps?&quot; 

&quot;This suit helps augment my natural ability to jump. Normally I can 
only make jumps of around fifteen feet, but with the suit&#39;s booster 
system I can usually jump up to around twenty feet. However, since the 
booster shorted out and depressurized, I can&#39;t jump very high while 
wearing this armor. Too much weight.&quot; 

Serenity nodded. &quot;I&#39;d like to thank you for saving Artemis, and I&#39;m 
sorry your efforts damaged your armor.&quot; 

Raijen bowed his head. &quot;It is my duty to serve, your Majesty, even if 
you aren&#39;t my queen.&quot; 

She sighed and stifled the urge to scream. &quot;Captain, please. My name 
is Serenity and I&#39;d like it if you called me that.&quot; He looked up at 
her with a startled look on his face and she flinched as his visor&#39;s 
pupilless eyes gazed at her. 

His visor-eyes blinked as he noticed her reaction, then went dark as 
he removed the helmet and clipped it onto his belt. &quot;With all due 
respect, your Majesty, that would be a breech of etiquette.&quot; 

She looked at him and sighed quietly. &quot;While in public, yes, but I 
would like you to call Serenity when in private. There are times where 
I tire of being seen as a queen and a public figure.&quot; 

Raijen blinked as he saw strange emotions stirring in the depths of 
her lavender eyes and wondered if he was miscalculating something. &quot;I 
see....&quot; he said as he stood up. He grimaced involuntarily as pain 
shot down his leg. 

&quot;You&#39;re injured....&quot; Serenity said with concern. 

&quot;It&#39;s nothing, a small burn from the booster shorting out,&quot; he said. 
His visor had showed him that what it should be, but he knew that it 
was possible that he had gotten burned by the superheated compressor 
gas as it vented. 

Serenity frowned. &quot;Still, I want to have it looked at. Mercury is 
rather occupied right now so you&#39;ll have to let me tend to it.&quot; 

&quot;That really isn&#39;t necessary, your.... I mean, Serenity. I&#39;ve suffered 
far worse injuries before and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; he replied. He 
blinked as Serenity started laughing quietly to herself. 

&quot;Are you sure you&#39;re not one of my captains? You&#39;re as stubborn about 
getting your injuries tended to as they are,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Are you 
able to walk?&quot; 

&quot;Of course.&quot; 

&quot;Good, then let me take you to your room and have that leg looked at.&quot; 

Raijen blinked as a thought occurred to him. &quot;Umm.... I&#39;m afraid I 
don&#39;t have a room assignment yet.&quot; 

Serenity smiled slowly. &quot;Then we&#39;ll just have to get you one, then. 
I&#39;m sure I have several rooms available in the Royal Suites since we 
aren&#39;t hosting any ambassadors or other royalty right now.&quot; 

&quot;That really isn&#39;t necessary, Lady Serenity....&quot; 

Serenity pretended to be insulted. &quot;Come now, Captain, you go above 
and beyond the call of your duties to your own queen and damage your 
armor in the process, all for sake of one of my friend&#39;s kittens. You 
can at least let me thank you by providing you with a private suite 
and a suit of formal wear.&quot; 

The Dragoon suddenly got the sneaking suspicion that he was being set 
up for something. He ordinarily despised social functions, preferring 
to remain in the background and watching for any signs of trouble. He 
couldn&#39;t figure out why, but he found himself entertaining the thought 
of attending the ball with Queen Serenity. 

&quot;Well, Captain?&quot; she said. 

Raijen nodded. &quot;Since you put it that way, Lady Serenity, I don&#39;t 
think I can refuse. However, I may have to return to my duties if need 
be,&quot; he said, planning on using that as an excuse to bail out if 
things got too uncomfortable for him. 

Serenity nodded. &quot;Of course, Captain. Now, if you&#39;ll come with me?&quot; 
she said and held her arm out. Raijen gently took her arm in his and 
allowed her to show him to the Royal Suites. During the trip, he spent 
half of his time trying to ignore the pain in his leg and the other 
half trying to figure out why he had the feeling that he had just been 
trapped. 

Oddly enough, he found that he didn&#39;t mind that feeling, either. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

&quot;That&#39;s sweet,&quot; Sailor Venus said with a smile. &quot;You really saved 
Artemis from drowning?&quot; 

Raijen looked mildly offended. &quot;Why would I say that if it wasn&#39;t 
true?&quot; 

Venus blushed and discreetly leaned against Maze. &quot;Well, I just wanted 
to make sure I heard that correctly.&quot; 

The Dragoon captain nodded in understanding. &quot;It never hurts to double 
check on most things.&quot; He gave Serenity a gentle smile and blinked at 
the odd look on Sailor Moon&#39;s face. &quot;Is something wrong, Serena?&quot; 

Sailor Moon blushed and looked down at the Imperium Silver Crystal. 
&quot;No, I&#39;m.... just still adjusting to the idea that my father is.... is 
from the Negaverse. I mean.... we&#39;ve been trying to fight the 
Negaverse for quite some time now, and.... and....&quot; 

Raijen gently placed a hand on her shoulder and she looked up at him. 
&quot;I know it must be very confusing for you, Serena, but I am not the 
enemy. I hope you can understand that I founded the Dragoons as a way 
to unite the most loyal and intelligent denizens together to serve 
their queen. Had I known that they would one day have to fight my 
daughter, I would never have done so.&quot; 

Sailor Moon blinked and smiled slightly. &quot;I understand.... but this 
it&#39;s still so.... strange.&quot; 

&quot;Strange indeed,&quot; said a soft voice. Everyone immediately leapt up and 
turned to face their new visitor. &quot;Had I not heard Captain Raijen 
himself say that Sailor Moon was his daughter, I would never have 
believed it,&quot; she said as she stepped out of the shadows, flanked by 
two other denizens. 

Tolaris felt his blood run cold. &quot;General Rune,&quot; he said with a nod of 
his head. &quot;I was wondering if this was one of your traps.&quot; He felt his 
blood run even colder as he recognized Commander Shar-Tei and Psi-Corp 
Commander Ts&#39;ani standing behind the dark-haired general. 

&quot;Of course, Commander, it been since I discovered your presence on 
Earth.&quot; She turned to Raijen and regarded him carefully. &quot;I am honored 
to finally meet you, Captain Raijen. You are, after all, one of the 
few legendary warriors we have in our history. And I must say that I 
am honored to meet you too, Queen Serenity, for it is not everyday 
that one meets the woman who managed to defeat the Shadow Warriors of 
the NegaForce.&quot; 

Tolaris frowned darkly at Rune. &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you would let us 
return to Earth without any hostilities, would you?&quot; he asked evenly. 

Rune laughed for several seconds. &quot;Of course not, Commander, though I 
am not surprised that you bothered to ask. Why should I let you go 
when I have the perfect chance to eliminate the Sailor Scouts once and 
for all?&quot; 

Raijen stepped forward and scowled. &quot;You will do so because they have 
not made any sort of hostile move against you and only wish to leave 
in peace.&quot; 

&quot;Captain, please, they have intruded into one of my military complexes 
and have been caught attempting to steal a pair of crystals from a 
secured storage area,&quot; Rune said, no longer smiling. &quot;Lieutenant Maze 
and Commander Tolaris are under arrest for treason, and the Sailor 
Scouts will be punished for their roles in the death of Queen Beryl.&quot; 

Without warning, a pair of figures shimmered into existance in the 
midst of the group. &quot;And what of your crimes, Rune?&quot; Captain Whisper 
hissed. Her arm had been cut and was still slowly dripping dark green 
blood. She was doing her best to support Lieutenant Ra&#39;vel who 
appeared to have been drugged into unconsciousness. &quot;I happened to 
check on Ra&#39;vel just as your &#39;doctors&#39; were getting ready to kill her 
and make it look like her heart failed on her. If I hadn&#39;t gotten 
suspicious, they would have killed her and laid a trap for me as 
well.&quot; 

Commander Ts&#39;ani stepped forward and regarded Whisper coldly. &quot;We 
don&#39;t tolerate traitors in the ranks, Captain,&quot; he said icily. &quot;You 
always were a weak fool and now you shall pay for it.&quot; 

Whisper laughed and carefully gave Ra&#39;vel to Maze. &quot;I&#39;m surprised that 
you actually have the nerve to challenge me, Ts&#39;ani. I thought that 
after our last &#39;practice&#39; battle that you would have learned your 
lesson.&quot; 

&quot;So it is a duel, then?&quot; Rune said innocently. &quot;I&#39;m afraid that means 
Tolaris won&#39;t let anyone interfere then, isn&#39;t that right, Commander?&quot; 

Tolaris gave the general a dark look. &quot;I am aware of the rules 
regarding duels, General. However, let me assure you that your trap 
won&#39;t work.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; said Jupiter as she took up a defensive posture. &quot;Get 
ready to rumble, because we&#39;re going to turn your little trap upside 
down.&quot; 

&quot;Right behind you, Jupiter,&quot; Mars said. 

Sailor Moon nodded and flexed her wrist, still holding the Crescent 
Moon Wand. &quot;I won&#39;t let you hurt my friends. Get ready to become moon 
dust,&quot; she said darkly. 

General Rune smiled. &quot;Just a moment, ladies, I believe that we still 
have some business to attend to first. Or rather, Commander Tolaris 
does.&quot; 

Tolaris frowned slightly. &quot;And what might that be?&quot; His frown deepened 
as Shar-Tei stepped forward and glared at him. 

&quot;That would be your surrender, Commander,&quot; the Dragoon said coldly. 

&quot;A Dragoon never surrenders,&quot; he replied and Raijen nodded slowly. &quot;Am 
I to believe General Rune put you up to this?&quot; 

Shar-Tei&#39;s featureless eyes narrowed at Tolaris. &quot;She didn&#39;t have to, 
Tolaris, because unlike you, I haven&#39;t let my personal feelings 
interfere with my sworn duty to General Rune and the NegaForce.&quot; 

Tolaris froze as her words replayed themselves in his mind. &quot;Feelings? 
What sort of feelings?&quot; 

&quot;It no longer matters,&quot; Shar-Tei said as she pulled her symipa from 
the holster on her back. The weapon made an odd liquid-like sound as 
it slowly changed from it&#39;s cylindrical form into it&#39;s combat-ready 
spear form. &quot;I will only ask you once more, Commander. Surrender.&quot; 

Tolaris sighed heavily as he drew his own symipa out of his holster 
and activated it. &quot;Maze, I want you to keep Ra&#39;vel out of danger,&quot; he 
said quietly and the lieutenant nodded. 

&quot;Boss.... be careful,&quot; Maze said softly. 

Tolaris only nodded and turned to face his former second-in-command, 
his symipa held at the ready. &quot;Shar-Tei, don&#39;t do this. We don&#39;t have 
to fight this way,&quot; he said quietly to her, knowing it was a futile 
attempt but he had to try anyway. 

&quot;I take it you refuse to surrender, then?&quot; she said. He nodded once 
and her expression hardened into stone. &quot;Then prepare to be 
destroyed,&quot; she hissed darkly. 

General Rune laughed and raised her arms towards Sailor Moon. &quot;Now, my 
dear Sailor Moon, we can take care of our business,&quot; she said and the 
room went mad. 

Sailor Moon gasped as Rune flung her arms out and a glittering cloud 
of tiny crystal shards were thrown at them. Before any of them could 
react to the threat, Lieutenant Maze clapped his hands together and 
concentrated. A wall of electromagnetic energy shimmered into 
existence in front of the Sailor Scouts, blocking most of the 
projectiles. 

The few remaining projectiles that weren&#39;t deflected by the energy 
shield struck glancing blows off of Jupiter and Mars. They both hissed 
in pain as the shards sliced fabric and skin, adding dozens of cuts to 
their already battered and bruised bodies. Jupiter cussed rather 
loudly while Mars muttered several dark comments involving uniforms 
and swiss cheese. 

Off to one side, Whisper and Ts&#39;ani each had their hands locked around 
the other&#39;s head, deeply embroiled in psionic combat. The amount of 
mental energy clashing between the two was powerful enough to create 
odd little ripples in the air between them, a physical side-effect of 
their mental duel. 

At the other end of the room, Tolaris and Shar-Tei appeared to be 
occupied in a dance of sorts, each moving with unnerving speed and 
grace as they blocked and attacked, neither one gaining any sort of 
advantage over the other. The sounds of the two symipas clashing 
against other was almost rhythmic, adding to the appearance of a 
battle dance taking place. 

Venus dodged the projectiles aimed at her and focused her mind for a 
quick counter-attack. &quot;Venus Crescent Beam SMASH!!&quot; she yelled as the 
twin beams of energy merged at her fingertips and lashed out. 

Rune laughed as a purplish globe of energy sprang into existance 
around her, forming a protective barrier. The Crescent Beam struck the 
globe head-on and was quickly absorbed into the shimmering sphere. 

&quot;No way!&quot; Venus said, blinking in shock. &quot;How&#39;d you do that?&quot; 

&quot;Foolish girl, did you think I&#39;d face you without help? The NegaForce 
has granted me its powers to destroy you. Your pathetic powers are no 
longer any match for me,&quot; the dark general said with a sneer. 

&quot;Time to turn up the juice, then,&quot; Jupiter said with a snarl. &quot;Hey 
Mars, your bird wanna play?&quot; 

&quot;Always. Consider this payback for ruining my suit, dirtbag,&quot; Mars 
said, glaring at Rune. &quot;Mars Firebird.... STRIKE!!&quot; 

&quot;Jupiter Thunder Dragon!&quot; 

With a roar and a screech, the air above the Sailor Scouts was 
suddenly occupied by the Thunder Dragon and the Firebird. They 
simultaneously launched an attack against Rune, their claws striking 
repeatedly at the dark sphere with no obvious effect. 

&quot;You don&#39;t get it, do you, Sailor Scouts? You can&#39;t defeat me this 
time,&quot; General Rune said as she raised her arms towards the attacking 
forms. A pair of black lightning bolts lashed out from her fingertips, 
enveloping the forms in dark energy. They threw their heads back and 
roared in pain before they were disrupted and lost their forms. 

&quot;What gives? She should have been toast by now,&quot; Jupiter said, trying 
to throw off the shock of having her Thunder Dragon disrupted. Beside 
her, Sailor Mars was mildly stunned and would have fallen if Sailor 
Mercury hadn&#39;t stepped forward and supported her. 

&quot;Tell me, is that the best you can do?&quot; teased Rune. &quot;Queen Beryl must 
have been weak indeed if you were able to destroy her with that,&quot; she 
said and started laughing. 

&quot;Laugh this off, Negatrash,&quot; Sailor Moon said as she held up the 
Crescent Moon Wand. &quot;Cosmic Moon Power....&quot; she intoned as she 
commanded the energies of the Imperium Silver Crystal to lash out. 

Tiny tendrils of energy streamed out of the Crystal and collected into 
a tiny ball between the tips of the Crescent Moon Wand. The ball 
quickly grew into a large sphere that darted towards General Rune and 
impacted against her energy shield. There was a burst of light and 
energy as the full power of the Imperium Silver Crystal clashed with 
the power of the NegaForce. 

Sailor Moon&#39;s jaw dropped as the glow faded and the dark sphere 
remained intact. &quot;Impossible! You should be moon dust by now!&quot; she 
said, her blue eyes almost as wide as saucers. Everyone was equally 
stunned and Rune laughed very softly, the sinister sound sending a 
chill down everyone&#39;s spine. 

&quot;You forget, Sailor Moon, that I have control over all things crystal, 
and that includes the almighty Imperium Silver Crystal. While I 
wouldn&#39;t have been able to survive that without the NegaForce&#39;s help, 
I am quite capable on my own of destroying it,&quot; she said and raised 
her hand. 

Sailor Moon blinked as the Crystal started to resonate and shake 
slightly. Behind her, Queen Serenity gasped and clutched her chest as 
the source of her existence started to weaken. Raijen blinked in shock 
as she stumbled against him and he wrapped his arm around her waist to 
support her. 

Sailor Mercury quickly activated her computer and started to do a scan 
of the Crystal. &quot;Sailor Moon, she&#39;s creating a soundwave that&#39;s 
attuned to the natural frequency of the Crystal! My scans are showing 
several stress faults developing and if we don&#39;t block that sound 
soon, the Crystal will shatter!&quot; 

Raijen looked up in alarm. &quot;If that happens, Serenity will die!&quot; 

&quot;Not happening,&quot; Sailor Venus said as she stood next to Sailor Moon, 
her Venus wand in her hands. &quot;C&#39;mon, Scouts, we got to rally here. 
Venus Power!&quot; she said and raised her Wand above Sailor Moon&#39;s head. 

The other Sailor Scouts quickly formed a circle around Sailor Moon, 
their Wands touching together above her head. 

&quot;Mercury Power!&quot; 

&quot;Mars Power!&quot; 

&quot;Jupiter Power!&quot; 

Energy sparked between the Wands and tiny motes started to circle 
around the group. There was a flash of light and the five of them were 
surrounded by a glittering energy field. General Rune frowned as the 
new shield dampened her powers and she tried to compensate. 

&quot;Great powers of the NegaForce, I command you to increase my powers a 
thousand-fold to destroy the Imperium Silver Crystal and the only 
thing that stands in your way of conquering the universe!&quot; she said. 
She laughed as new power flowed through her body and she renewed her 
attack on the Crystal. 

Sailor Moon gasped as a tiny crack appeared on the surface of the 
Crystal. There was a flash of light and she felt her powers fading 
rapidly, reversing her transformation and returning her to the form of 
Serena. 

Serenity cried out and went limp, her physical form starting to fade 
along with her spiritual lifeforce. Raijen quickly made a decision and 
gently laid her on the floor. He stood up and quickly ran to Sailor 
Moon&#39;s side, pausing just long enough to grab his life crystal from 
the pedestal. 

&quot;Serena, my daughter, there&#39;s no time to explain what I&#39;m going to 
have to do to save your mother&#39;s life. Do you trust me?&quot; he said 
quickly. 

Serena blinked and looked up at him. &quot;I.... I trust you.... father.&quot; 

&quot;Then give me the Crystal.&quot; 

She blinked and the Sailor Scouts exchanged glances. &quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;There&#39;s no time, Serena. If you trust me, then give me the Crystal.&quot; 

Serena only hesitated for a fraction of a second before she reached 
down and removed the Crystal from the Crescent Moon Wand. She gasped 
as another crack appeared in the Crystal and she felt pain sweep 
throughout her body. She handed the Crystal to Raijen and whispered, 
&quot;Please don&#39;t prove me wrong.&quot; 

Raijen nodded once, cupping the Imperium Silver Crystal in one hand 
while holding his life crystal in the other. He took a deep breath 
and, focusing the deepest part of his mind and soul, smashed the two 
crystals together. 

There was a great burst of light as the two crystals disintegrated, 
and then everything went dark. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Princess Serena blinked and looked around her. She, Raijen, and 
Serenity were inside a large, featureless black sphere. They were all 
bathed in a soft white light, the source of which was a mystery to the 
princess. She turned to look at Raijen and saw the tiny glittering 
fragments of the two crystals slowly falling from his fingers. 

&quot;You destroyed the Imperium Silver Crystal,&quot; she said softly as her 
eyes started to fill with tears. &quot;I trusted you and you betrayed me 
and mother.&quot; 

Raijen nodded slowly and cradled the still form of Serenity in his 
arms. &quot;I had to in order to save it and your mother, Serena,&quot; he 
replied. &quot;Otherwise General Rune would have shattered it and it would 
have been gone forever.&quot; 

Serena paused and wiped away a stray tear. &quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot; 

&quot;All denizens are born with the essence of Chaos in their souls. As 
they mature, it takes on several forms and imprints them into the 
denizen&#39;s mind. This is why each denizen has several powers and 
talents that they are able to use once they fully mature. One of the 
abilities I have been blessed with is the power to fuse two different 
systems of energy into one.&quot; 

Serena paused as her mind sought to understand. &quot;You.... used your 
power to fuse the two crystals together?&quot; she said hesitantly. 

Raijen nodded slowly. &quot;Yes. Ordinarily the two powers would simply 
merge into a new form, but each crystal held several unique abilities 
that conflicted with one another. That is why they shattered. But 
their powers are still very much intact, however, and are currently in 
the process of combining themselves into a single crystal.&quot; 

Serena nodded as things finally made sense. &quot;I understand now. But 
what about mother?&quot; 

The Dragoon stroked Serenity&#39;s forehead and sighed. &quot;Her lifeforce is 
attuned to the Imperium Silver Crystal, She won&#39;t regain consciousness 
until the Crystal is able to reestablish its powers. I&#39;m not sure why 
I&#39;m not in a similiar state, as what&#39;s left of my own lifeforce was 
attuned to my crystal.&quot; 

&quot;So what will happen with this new crystal?&quot; 

Raijen smiled at Serena and she gave him a curious look. &quot;If 
everything works the way it should, Serenity and I will be together in 
the new crystal and you will be able to draw from both our powers.&quot; 

Both of them blinked as a tiny point of light lazily floated between 
them on an invisible current. The light was shortly followed by 
several other dots of light, all following the same gentle course. 
Within minutes, the sphere was filled with tiny dots of white light, 
wandering aimlessly around the room in a seemingly random pattern. 

They watched in wonder as the motes started to swirl together and 
slowly condense into a large sphere. As more and more motes were drawn 
into the mass of light, the diameter of the sphere started to shrink 
and it started to glow brighter and brighter. As the last of the motes 
were drawn into the sphere, it let loose with a blinding flash of 
light. 

When Princess Serena regained her vision a few seconds later, what she 
saw brought a soft smile to her lips. Hovering effortlessly in one 
place was the Imperium Silver Crystal, glowing softly to itself. 
Serena took a closer look at the Crystal&#39;s surface and blinked as she 
realized that the many facets of the Crystal were more sharply defined 
and tinted a very dark shade of purple. 

But the sight that had made her smile was not the sight of the 
Crystal, but the sight of her mother, now fully conscious and looking 
as beautiful as ever, being tenderly held in Captain Raijen&#39;s arms. 
The Dragoon slowly bent his head down and gently kissed her. They 
shared the kiss for several seconds before they broke apart and he 
helped her stand up. 

&quot;Finally we are together again, after all this time,&quot; Serenity said 
softly as she leaned against Raijen. 

&quot;And we shall be for the rest of eternity,&quot; he replied. &quot;I know I&#39;ve 
only had to chance to say this once, beloved, but I love you.&quot; 

Serenity hugged him tightly, trying her best not to cry and failing 
rather miserably, &quot;And I have always loved you,&quot; she said. 

He smiled and kissed her forehead. &quot;When we have the time, we&#39;ll have 
to do our best to make up for those thousand years we were apart. But 
right now, our daughter needs our help to save her friends.&quot; 

&quot;Of course,&quot; Serenity said, nodding towards her daughter. &quot;You lost 
the power of Sailor Moon when the Crystal was destroyed, but now that 
it has been reforged, you once again can use her powers in the name of 
the Moon.&quot; 

&quot;You have been using the powers of the Crystal as a focus for your 
own,&quot; Raijen said. &quot;Now you must learn to use the Crystal as the 
source for your new powers.&quot; 

Serena blinked as the Imperium Silver Crystal floated over to her. The 
iridescent gem pulsed brightly and she felt a surge of warmth through 
her body. Her eyes widened slightly when she saw that the Imperium 
Silver Crystal was now firmly imbedded in her transformation brooch. 
&quot;What must I do?&quot; she asked. 

&quot;Say the words &#39;Moon Crystal Power&#39; and your spirit will unite with 
the powers of the Imperium Silver Crystal to become Sailor Moon,&quot; 
Serenity replied with a gentle smile. 

Princess Serena nodded and focused her mind. &quot;Moon Crystal Power!!&quot; 
she said and started to transform. Slender tendrils of energy shot out 
from the Crystal and wrapped themselves around her body, solidifying 
into her new Sailor Suit. The new powers imprinted themselves on her 
essence and for one brief moment, as both her sigil and her aura 
flared into view, she had the feathery wings of an angel. The new 
energy faded and Sailor Moon blinked in surprise. 

&quot;I feel.... different,&quot; she said hesitantly. 

Serenity laughed softly and the sphere echoed with the sound. &quot;You 
just need time to adjust to your new powers, my daughter. Now that you 
have the power of the Crystal, you won&#39;t need the Crescent Moon Wand 
anymore.&quot; She held out her hand and the Wand materialized in front of 
her. 

&quot;But you will still need a focus for your powers,&quot; Raijen added, &quot;And 
so we shall give you a new one.&quot; He joined hands with Serenity and 
together they concentrated on the Crescent Moon Wand. Sailor Moon 
blinked as the Wand lost its form and started to melt, only to be 
reformed into a new shape. 

&quot;Behold your Moon Sceptre,&quot; Raijen said as the Sceptre slowly floated 
over and into Sailor Moon&#39;s outstretched hands. She blinked as she 
felt another surge of energy through her body and she understood how 
to fully wield its new powers. 

&quot;And now you must return to your friends, my dear Serena. You must 
never forget that you will always be in our hearts and we will always 
be with you,&quot; Serenity said started to dissolve in a sparkle of light. 

&quot;Never forget that without love and justice in the universe, nothing 
would still exist,&quot; Raijen said as he too started to dissolve. &quot;Your 
friends are counting on you and you must not let them down.&quot; 

&quot;I promise I won&#39;t let them down,&quot; Sailor Moon replied and closed her 
eyes as she dissolved into a swirl of golden light. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

General Rune laughed triumphantly as the Silver Imperium Crystal was 
destroyed and Sailor Moon vanished in a flash of light, along with 
Serenity and Raijen. &quot;At last, the mighty Sailor Moon is no longer!&quot; 

The Sailor Scouts slowly got up from the floor, having been tossed 
like leaves by the force of the Crystal shattering. Their energy 
shield had been disrupted along with their concentration and was now 
only a quickly fading wall of dim motes of light. 

&quot;Sailor Moon!&quot; Tuxedo Mask cried out, unbelieving that she had 
vanished. 

&quot;She&#39;s.... she&#39;s gone!&quot; Mars said as the cold hand of fear clutched at 
her heart and threatened to make it quit. 

&quot;What did you do with her?&quot; Sailor Jupiter said dangerously. 

&quot;I finally ridded the universe of her meddlesome presence,&quot; Rune said 
with a sneer and raised her hands towards the Sailor Scouts. &quot;As I am 
about to do with you....&quot; 

&quot;Not so fast, Negatrash,&quot; said the voice of Sailor Moon from behind 
the general. &quot;You aren&#39;t going to do anything except surrender.&quot; 

Everyone blinked and Rune whipped around. &quot;Impossible! I destroyed you 
and the Imperium Silver Crystal!&quot; Her dark eyes narrowed as she saw 
the gleam of the Crystal on her chest ribbon. &quot;So you&#39;ve managed to 
reforge it, I see. No matter. If I can shatter it once, I can shatter 
it again!&quot; she said and lashed out with her powers. 

Rune&#39;s eyes widened with shock as she couldn&#39;t feel her powers having 
any effect on the Crystal. &quot;How is this possible? I should have been 
able to make that crystal crack by now. What are you?&quot; 

&quot;I am Sailor Moon, the champion of justice!&quot; Sailor Moon said. &quot;I will 
right wrongs and triumph over evil, and that means you. In the name of 
the Moon, I will punish you for your evil deeds!&quot; 

Maze glaced towards Sailor Moon and discreetly leaned towards Venus. 
&quot;I don&#39;t mean any offense or anything, Mina, but does she always sound 
like that?&quot; he said quietly. 

Venus sighed and nodded, never taking her eyes of Rune and Sailor 
Moon. &quot;Unfortunately for the rest of us, she does,&quot; she replied in the 
same quiet tone. 

&quot;Feel the full power of the NegaForce, Sailor Moon!&quot; Rune yelled as 
she unleashed several bolts of black lightning. Sailor Moon dodged and 
held out a strange wand that the other Scouts had never seen before. 

&quot;Moon Sceptre....&quot; she said as energy collected at the tip of her Moon 
Sceptre and formed into a curved arc. &quot;ELIMINATION!!!&quot; she commanded 
and the arc darted forward, diving and swooping towards its target. 

It collided with Rune&#39;s energy barrier and there was a flash of light. 
A small crack appeared in the globe&#39;s surface and quickly spread 
across the rest of the barrier. There was a sickening crack and the 
barrier shattered, the fragments dissolving into tiny purple motes 
that vanished into nothingness. 

Rune stepped back in shock. &quot;How?&quot; she whispered. &quot;How could you have 
destroyed the NegaForce&#39;s shield? What kind of powers do you have?&quot; 

Sailor Moon slowly advanced, still holding the Moon Sceptre at the 
ready. &quot;My powers come from more than a mere crystal. They come from 
something which very few of your kind can ever hope to understand and 
even fewer to experience. My powers come from the force of love, 
General Rune, a force more powerful than the darkest of your powers. 
Surrender now or I will be forced to destroy you as I had to destroy 
Queen Beryl.&quot; 

Rune nodded slowly. &quot;Very well, Sailor Moon, I yield for today. But be 
warned that you haven&#39;t seen the last of me.&quot; She turned and gestured 
towards the storage room wall. The air seemed to shimmer as a rift was 
opened up and the dark general escaped through it. As soon as it had 
come, the rift sealed itself and everyone breathed a sigh of relief. 

The mood was short-lived as a scream cut through the air and everyone 
turned around to face the sound. Captain Whisper snorted and let the 
body of Commander Ts&#39;ani fall to the ground. &quot;Weak-minded fool, I 
warned you several times that you were no match for me,&quot; she muttered 
to herself. 

Maze frowned. &quot;Excuse me, Captain, but is he....&quot; he said, not able to 
finish his sentence. 

Whisper nodded. &quot;Of course. In a duel of that magnitude, not only is 
the loser guaranteed to die, but the winner might not be in much 
better shape as well. The price of using your mind as both sword and 
shield.&quot; She glanced across the room, did a double-take, and blinked. 
&quot;What, those two are still going at it?&quot; 

Everyone followed her gaze and blinked as they realized that Tolaris 
and Shar-Tei were indeed still dueling. Mercury stepped forward but 
Maze reached out and blocked her path. &quot;Sorry, ma&#39;am, I can&#39;t let you 
interfere. Dragoon Rules of Engagement. The boss would have my head if 
I didn&#39;t stop anyone who wanted to help.&quot; 

Mercury looked at the two combatants and sighed softly to herself. &quot;Is 
there nothing we can do?&quot; 

Maze shook his head. &quot;Not until one of them dies, I&#39;m afraid. Trust 
me, I&#39;m no more happy about it as you are, but I wouldn&#39;t want to be 
the one that Tolaris would have to kill for violating the rules of a 
death match.&quot; 

Tuxedo Mask blinked. &quot;You mean that if you interfere, they would have 
to kill you?&quot; he said incrediously. 

&quot;Unfortunately, yes.&quot; 

&quot;Remind me not to get into fights with you very often,&quot; Venus said 
softly. 

Maze blinked and grinned. &quot;Why, planning on doing so at a later date?&quot; 

&quot;No, but this would make me want to think twice,&quot; she replied. 

The rest of the group fell silent as they watched Commander Tolaris 
and Commander Shar-Tei duel not just for their lives, but for their 
honor as well. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

They fought with remarkable efficiency, neither one wasting a motion 
as they continued their systematic attacks, blocks, and 
counter-attacks. Their concentration was absolute, not allowing 
anything around them to distract them from their battle. Even when 
Sailor Moon vanished in the flash of light, their only reaction was to 
blink involuntarily against the glare and to continue the silent 
battle. 

A distant part of Tolaris&#39;s mind noted that it seemed that as soon as 
the analytical part of his mind identified a pattern to Shar-Tei&#39;s 
movements, she would immediately change them, forcing him to adapt and 
to try to find a new pattern. 

He tried to determine if there was a pattern to her pattern changes or 
the timing of them. He worked on the problem for a few minutes before 
he thought he had a solution. Just as he was getting ready for her 
next change, Shar-Tei suddenly feinted and brought her symipa down in 
a tight arc. 

While Tolaris wasn&#39;t really expecting such a move, he was still 
prepared for it. He blocked with the center of his symipa and swung 
downwards with the blunt end of his weapon. She blocked with the high 
end of her own weapon and he brought the bladed end of his symipa up 
at a sharp angle. Again she blocked as he had expected, but the 
results took them both by surprise. 

With a sharp crack, her symipa snapped in half and Tolaris&#39;s weapon 
was able to continue its arc, only slightly slowed by the force of the 
impact with her weapon. Tolaris felt the weapon jerk slightly in his 
hands and they both froze in place. 

Ever so slowly, they both looked at the bladed part of Tolaris&#39;s 
weapon. The only signs that it had been involved in combat was a small 
scratch along one side of the blade&#39;s surface and a rather 
insignificant streak of redness that was slowly oozing down the 
symipa&#39;s shaft. 

Tolaris glanced at her uniform and noted with dismay at how fast the 
stain on her abdomen was spreading. He looked up to find Shar-Tei 
regarding him with an odd look in her eyes. They said nothing at 
first, both knowing that the wound was fatal. 

&quot;So it appears that you have won, Commander,&quot; she said softly, moving 
back a few steps to lean against the wall. &quot;Tell me, what are the odds 
of having a symipa snap in battle like that?&quot; 

&quot;To be honest, I didn&#39;t think it was possible to snap them,&quot; he 
replied. 

&quot;It would be my luck to have a flawed weapon,&quot; she said and began to 
laugh softly. She grimaced and quit laughing after a few seconds as 
the motion made her insides scream in agony. &quot;Actually, Tolaris, I&#39;m 
rather glad I didn&#39;t have to kill you.&quot; 

&quot;Shar-Tei....&quot; 

&quot;Let me finish, Commander,&quot; she said mildly. &quot;Remember what I said 
about not letting my personal feelings interfere with my duty? Well, I 
still haven&#39;t done that nor would I ever have. But now I think I can 
answer your question, the one you asked me earlier.&quot; 

&quot;About your feelings?&quot; he said softly. 

&quot;Yes, that one,&quot; she said and coughed. She sighed as she spat blood 
and shrugged. &quot;I think now I understand why you violated your oath of 
loyalty to Beryl and put your life at risk. all for the sake of a 
young girl,&quot; she said quietly, nodding towards Sailor Mercury. &quot;I know 
now what it feels like to be in love with someone.&quot; 

Tolaris nodded slowly in understanding. &quot;A wonderful experience, 
wouldn&#39;t you say, Commander?&quot; 

&quot;Very much.&quot; 

&quot;Shar-Tei.... is there any sort of message you would like me to convey 
to your loved one? I swear upon my honor that I will get it to him, 
one way or another.&quot; 

Shar-Tei laughed again, this time able to ignore the pain of her wound 
and to enjoy the sensation of laughter. &quot;Tolaris, you really are as 
dense as they say sometimes.&quot; 

The Dragoon blinked in confusion. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; 

She smiled at him and did her best to ignore the feeling of numbness 
that was slowly spreading throughout her body. &quot;You stupid fool.... I 
loved you.&quot; She started laughing softly again at the stunned look on 
his face. 

&quot;Shar-Tei.... why didn&#39;t you ever tell me, then?&quot; Tolaris said, still 
deeply shaken by her confession. 

&quot;Well, the regulation about not having personal affairs within the 
ranks had a lot to do with it,&quot; she admitted. &quot;But the main factor was 
that I didn&#39;t know how you would react to it, or even if you were 
capable of love yourself. And when we found out that you were capable 
of it, you had already fallen in love with Sailor Mercury and was 
frozen in crystal. I never got the chance to tell you.&quot; 

Tolaris said nothing as Shar-Tei coughed up more blood. She sighed and 
turned her head towards the group of Sailor Scouts. &quot;Sailor Mercury, I 
would speak with you for a moment,&quot; she said. 

Mercury blinked and moved forward until she stood next to Tolaris. 
&quot;Yes?&quot; 

Shar-Tei looked her over and finally nodded. &quot;Commander Tolaris may be 
a brilliant Dragoon, but he can be lacking in the social skills 
department on occasion. I would like you to look after him and keep 
him out of trouble.&quot; 

Both Tolaris and Mercury blinked in surprise. &quot;I promise,&quot; Mercury 
said in a soft tone. 

Shar-Tei grunted and glared at her. &quot;Oh, one more thing. You had 
better love Tolaris as much as he loves you or I swear I shall return 
from my grave to haunt you for eternity. Understand?&quot; 

&quot;Of course, Commander,&quot; Mercury replied and Shar-Tei smiled. 

&quot;I wish you well, Tolaris,&quot; Shar-Tei said as she slumped to the 
ground. Tolaris and Mercury moved forward to help but she waved them 
off. &quot;I.... would just like you to know that you&#39;ll be in my heart. Or 
what&#39;s left of it,&quot; she said with an ironic grin. The grin slowly 
faded with her lifeforce and she closed her eyes as her pulse slowed 
to a standstill. And with one final, soft sigh that spoke of the love 
she was never able to fully express to anyone else, Dragoon Commander 
Shar-Tei died. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Luna and Artemis looked up as a whirling vortex opened up and the 
Sailor Scouts stepped through, followed by Tolaris and several other 
individuals the cats had never seen before. 

&quot;You&#39;re back!&quot; Luna cried as she leapt up and into Sailor Moon&#39;s arms. 
&quot;Thank goodness, you had no idea how worried we were. Is everyone 
alright?&quot; 

&quot;No, they aren&#39;t,&quot; Tolaris said as he help Whisper carry Ra&#39;vel out of 
the room and down the hall. &quot;Mercury, please help me get Ra&#39;vel to a 
room and make sure she gets comfortable. She&#39;s going to need a fair 
amount of medical care for awhile.&quot; 

&quot;No problem,&quot; Mercury replied and ran down the hall to get a room 
ready. 

Artemis bristled slightly at the sight of Maze, Ra&#39;vel, and Whisper. 
&quot;Um, would someone mind telling me who these people are?&quot; 

Venus smiled and picked up the white cat. &quot;Nice to see you too, 
Artemis. I would like to introduce Dragoon Lieutenant Maze, Psi-Corp 
Captain Whisper, and the unfortunately badly injured Dragoon 
Lieutenant Ra&#39;vel. They&#39;re friends of Tolaris and helped us get what 
we needed.&quot; 

&quot;Nice to meet you, Lieutenant,&quot; Luna said. 

Maze&#39;s tan eyes became impossibly wide as his gaze alternated between 
the two cats. &quot;You two can talk?&quot; 

Venus giggled. &quot;My, you&#39;re swift today,&quot; she said and gave him a quick 
kiss on the cheek. She looked up and frowned slightly as Artemis gave 
her a dour look. &quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;And what have you been doing inside the Negaverse?&quot; the cat asked. 

&quot;Getting our butts trashed,&quot; Jupiter sighed as she leaned against the 
wall and reversed her transformation. She waited until the process was 
finished before she gestured to Mars and added, &quot;Or in her case, her 
back.&quot; 

Luna took one look at the back of Sailor Mars&#39;s uniform and screeched. 
&quot;Sailor Mars, get that suit off and let me have a look at your back. 
The rest of you Sailor Scouts, too. I want to know precisely how badly 
torn up each one of you are.&quot; 

Mars snorted and walked towards a vacant room, muttering something 
about not wanting to flash everyone again. Leda shrugged and followed 
Mars, working the laces to her blouse as she went. 

&quot;I don&#39;t think you need to bother checking Ami out, since her vampiric 
healing thingy seems to be working fine,&quot; Sailor Moon said as she went 
after the others. 

Sailor Venus reversed her transformation and smiled at Luna. 
&quot;Actually, Luna, I want Artemis to check me out. That way, he, Maze, 
and I can have a long talk about several things while he&#39;s doing the 
check.&quot; 

Both Luna and Artemis blinked in confusion. &quot;Mina, talk about what?&quot; 
Luna asked cautiously. 

&quot;Well, in short, Maze and I have become rather fond of each other, 
much in the same fashion as Ami and Tolaris.&quot; 

Luna blinked and smiled while Artemis seemed to wilt like a dead 
flower. &quot;Mina, that&#39;s wonderful! I take it he has proven himself to be 
as trustworthy as Tolaris?&quot; Luna said, giving Maze a mild glance of 
approval. 

The blonde laughed. &quot;Of course he has. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have fallen 
in love with him if he wasn&#39;t.&quot; 

&quot;So nice to know I have a few redeeming qualities around here,&quot; Maze 
said rather dryly. 

&quot;A few,&quot; Mina teased and gave him a kiss that made Maze speechless, 
made Luna&#39;s eyebrows rise almost painfully, and made Artemis sigh 
heavily. Mina broke off the kiss and gave Artemis a patient look. &quot;The 
time has come, said she, to talk of many things,&quot; she cheerfully 
misquoted and went into another vacant room with Maze in tow. 

&quot;Artemis, don&#39;t you think....&quot; Luna started to say. 

&quot;I&#39;d rather not think at all, thank you,&quot; Artemis said briskly and 
went after the couple. Both Luna and Darian blinked as the door was 
almost slammed shut behind him. 

&quot;That&#39;s odd.... I thought he&#39;d be happy to discover that Mina had 
finally found someone she could fall in love with,&quot; Luna said with a 
small frown. 

&quot;Who knows?&quot; Darian said with a shrug. &quot;You, umm, want me to be 
checked out as well?&quot; he said with a small smirk. 

&quot;You wish,&quot; she replied dryly. &quot;You can ask Artemis to look you over 
when he&#39;s finished with Mina. Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have to check 
the damage to the girls,&quot; she said and walked into the room, closing 
the door behind her. 

Darian chuckled quietly and leaned against the wall. &quot;Well, it was 
worth a shot,&quot; he said to himself and sighed. He casually glanced out 
the window and blinked at the amount of snow on the ground. Looks like 
Tolaris forgot to turn it off before we left, he thought. I&#39;ll bet 
that means we&#39;re stuck here for another night. I wonder if I&#39;ll be 
able to share it with Serena again.... 

He was brought out of his fantasy daydream by the sound of something 
heavy skittering across the floor. He opened his eyes and screamed at 
the sight of a very large crystalline spider slowly climbing out of 
the cargo container. 

&quot;Calm down, Dyvach won&#39;t hurt you,&quot; Tolaris said as he entered the 
large room. &quot;Long time, no see, old friend,&quot; he said and the weaver 
almost killed itself in its haste to skitter over to Tolaris, making a 
series of loud sounds akin to a set of wind chimes caught in a 
hurricane. 

There was a rather high-pitched shriek from the doorway as Ami entered 
the room. &quot;Tolaris, what is that thing?!&quot; she demanded, backing away 
from Tolaris and the chiming spider. 

&quot;Relax, Ami. This is my pet weaver Dyvach,&quot; the Dragoon replied as he 
rubbed the weaver&#39;s carapace, causing the crystaline surface to take 
on a dark orange tint. 

&quot;A pet?&quot; echoed Darian and Ami simultaneously. The weaver fell silent 
for a moment before briefly chiming to Tolaris. Tolaris laughed 
quietly and patted the weaver once more. 

&quot;Okay, okay, more like a companion. Dyvach is a sentient being and 
knows what goes on around it. I&#39;m willing to bet that it was the one 
who gathered everything together in the container and later moved it 
to block the bulkhead from closing all the way.&quot; 

The weaver chimed almost indignantly and Tolaris grinned. &quot;Well, I 
wasn&#39;t sure if it was you or just extremely good luck.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s your pet?&quot; Ami said again, looking rather uneasy. 

The Dragoon smirked. &quot;Can&#39;t handle the thought of having a giant 
crystal spider being the one to be waiting for you when you get home 
to feed it?&quot; 

&quot;Ick....&quot; 

Darian frowned. &quot;Umm, would you like to rephrase that? It just didn&#39;t 
sound all that appealing....&quot; 

Tolaris thought about what he said and how it can be interpreted. 
&quot;Mmm. You may be right. Ami, just think of it as a truly bizarre breed 
of dog.&quot; 

&quot;Ick....&quot; 

Tolaris smiled and bent down to the weaver. &quot;Dyvach, the beautiful 
woman with blue hair over there is Ami Mizuno. Why don&#39;t you go over 
and introduce yourself?&quot; 

Ami&#39;s eyes became impossibly wide as the weaver skittered across the 
room and stood next to her, chiming softly and turning a delicate 
shade of blue. Her hands shook as the waver gently brushed up against 
her. She felt something warm on her foot and looked down to see the 
weaver attaching a small, slender crystalline thread to her ankle. 

Before she could react, the weaver quickly skittered back over to 
Tolaris, trailing the thread behind it. Tolaris was puzzled by the 
weaver&#39;s behavior until it attached the thread to his boot and began 
to trail a second slender thread back over to Ami. 

&quot;Dyvach....&quot; he said with a sigh. &quot;We&#39;re not weavers so trying to do 
that wouldn&#39;t work.&quot; The weaver chimed apologetically and quickly 
removed the small threads from their shoes. 

&quot;Umm, what was it trying to do?&quot; Darian asked hesitantly. 

&quot;When two weavers become lifemates, they seal themselves in a crystal 
web of sorts. They stay there until the female becomes pregnant, which 
has been known to take quite awhile,&quot; he said with a faint blush. He 
looked up to find Ami blushing a vivid shade of red. &quot;Problem, my 
love?&quot; 

&quot;I just hope Dyvach wasn&#39;t trying to tell us something,&quot; she managed 
to say. &quot;Not that I have any problems with the idea of marrying you 
one day, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be possible to have your child.... 
that is.... I....&quot; 

She blinked as Tolaris moved forward and enveloped her in a tender and 
loving embrace. &quot;I love you, Ami,&quot; he said simply as he held her. 

Ami smiled and laid her head against the crook of his shoulder. &quot;And I 
love you, Tolaris.&quot; 

&quot;Aww, that&#39;s so sweet....&quot; Rei said as she and Leda came out of the 
room. Behind them, the door closed softly and Leda shot it a slightly 
perturbed look. 

&quot;So where&#39;s Serena?&quot; Darian asked cautiously. 

&quot;Well, she and Luna are.... WHAT IN GOD&#39;S NAME IS THAT THING?!&quot; Rei 
said, panicking at the sight of the weaver. 

Tolaris sighed heavily and spent several minutes introducing Dyvach 
and explaining about weavers in general. 

&quot;Why do you keep calling Dyvach an it?&quot; Leda asked. Of the humans, she 
alone seemed to be interested in the weaver. 

&quot;Weavers won&#39;t develop any gender characteristics until they reach 
full maturity. I got Dyvach as a mere hatchling so it won&#39;t mature for 
at least another two or three decades.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s a relief,&quot; Ami said with a weak smile. 

&quot;Couldn&#39;t take the thought of waking up one morning to a nest of 
several dozen hatching weavers, eh?&quot; Tolaris chuckled. 

&quot;Several.... dozen?&quot; she replied. 

Tolaris frowned slightly. &quot;I sense that we are going to wind up having 
a conversation about Dyvach in the future, correct?&quot; 

&quot;The very near future,&quot; Ami said firmly. 

&quot;You know, Ami, Dyvach really likes you,&quot; the Dragoon said softly. 

Ami blinked. &quot;How do you figure that?&quot; 

&quot;Because it&#39;s purring at you.&quot; 

Ami blinked again and looked down. The weaver was almost sitting on 
her shoes and was indeed making a soft, purring sound. Ami sighed 
softly and tried to picture herself taking care of a large crystal 
spider as a pet. 

&quot;This.... will take some getting used to....&quot; she said hesitantly. 

&quot;You three would make the perfect family,&quot; Rei teased. 

&quot;Don&#39;t make me hurt you, Rei,&quot; Ami replied darkly. 

Darian coughed and suppressed a smile. &quot;Anyway, I take it you two are 
fine, considering the multitude of cuts, scrapes, and bruises you now 
possess?&quot; 

Leda sighed. &quot;Well, we all checked out fine, except Luna wants us to 
put a bunch of iodine in our bath tonight. Luna said she had been 
looking out the window at the snow and figured that we would have to 
spend the night again. So she asked us what kind of arrangements we 
made that night, and without stopping to think about it, I told her.&quot; 

Darian immediately broke out into a cold sweat. &quot;Umm, think I should 
go run and hide?&quot; 

&quot;Wimp,&quot; Rei snickered. 

&quot;Too late....&quot; Leda said warningly as the door opened up and Luna 
stalked out, making a beeline for Darian. The cat reached Darian and 
proceeded to use him like a tree, clawing her way up until she was 
face-to-face with him. She grabbed onto the end of his nose with a 
clawed paw and gave him a dark look. 

&quot;You may spend the night with Serena again. However, if you so much as 
think of touching her in the wrong way, I promise you a great deal of 
bodily harm. Do I make myself clear?&quot; she hissed. 

&quot;Perfectly,&quot; he said. 

&quot;Good,&quot; Luna said as she jumped down. &quot;Now that we&#39;ve got that 
settled, we can....&quot; she said and froze in fear at the sight of 
Dyvach. 

&quot;Already this is going to be a long day,&quot; Tolaris grumbled as he 
started to explain Dyvach again. 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

They were grouped around the coffee table in the living room, holding 
a conversation about what to expect from their new life on Earth. 
Ra&#39;vel was awake and sitting on the floor, paying a great deal of 
attention to Luna&#39;s fur and admiring the softness of it. The cat, for 
her part, was curled up in a ball in Ra&#39;vel&#39;s lap and contented 
herself to listening to the talk. 

Captain Whisper was sitting in an oversized arm chair, sipping a cup 
of Rei&#39;s herbal tea and trying to ignore her headache. Rei was 
kneeling in front of the fire, trying to try her hair out after a 
much-needed bath. She kept one eye on the flickering flames in the 
fireplace and the other on the weaver, who was sitting near the fire 
and soaking up a great deal of the heat. 

Tolaris was sitting on the loveseat with Ami curled up next to him, 
using his shoulder as a pillow. Darian was sitting at one end of the 
couch while Serena was stretched out over the rest, resting her head 
in his lap. 

The conversation had hit a temporary null spot when Artemis finally 
made an appearance, quietly walking into the group looking rather 
dejected. &quot;So how is everyone?&quot; he asked and sat down next to Ra&#39;vel. 

&quot;We were wondering when you&#39;d be finished with Mina and Maze,&quot; Leda 
said as she walked into the room and sat down in the empty arm chair. 
&quot;What went on that it took five hours to finish?&quot; 

Artemis sighed. &quot;Nothing. We were finished four hours ago. I just.... 
needed to get away to do a bit of thinking, that&#39;s all.&quot; 

Serena sat up and frowned. &quot;Four hours ago? What are they doing now?&quot; 

&quot;Well, Mina was apparently running off of adrenaline when you came 
back, because she started nodding off while I was checking her out and 
fell asleep shortly after that. Maze said that neither of them were 
able to get much sleep that night and we had a bit of a frank 
discussion about it. He said he was getting sleepy too so I guess that 
they&#39;re both out cold by now.&quot; 

&quot;Something I should be doing soon,&quot; Leda said as she suppressed a 
yawn. 

&quot;Mmm, same here,&quot; Serena said as she stretched. She looked up at 
Darian and smiled shyly. &quot;I know you should be exhausted after 
standing watch all night.&quot; 

Darian shrugged. &quot;I think I&#39;m still wired from Leda&#39;s coffee, but 
that&#39;s supposed to wear out real soon.&quot; 

&quot;Not my fault I like a strong cup of coffee,&quot; Leda grinned. 

&quot;Strong enough to melt the rock you poured the leftovers on?&quot; Rei 
teased. 

Tolaris laughed. &quot;That&#39;s only because it was a mimic and not a real 
rock. Besides, rocks don&#39;t scream like that when scalded.&quot; 

Both Whisper and Ra&#39;vel blinked. &quot;A mimic, you say?&quot; Whisper said with 
a small frown. &quot;I thought that they didn&#39;t live that close to 
structures like the complex.&quot; 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;When you get hungry enough, you&#39;ll move to wherever 
you can find food.&quot; 

&quot;True....&quot; 

Leda tried to supress a second yawn and failed rather miserably. 
&quot;That&#39;s it, I give up. I&#39;m going to bed,&quot; she said as she eased 
herself out of the chair. &quot;Good night, everyone and I&#39;ll....&quot; she 
trailed off as she glanced up. 

Everyone turned and blinked as Mina entered the room. She seemed to be 
fine except for the fact that she was wearing a white satin nightgown, 
she was smiling rather oddly, and that the sign of Venus was glowing a 
soft shade of orange on her forehead. 

She lazily made her way towards the kitchen and paused to look up at 
the rest of the group. &quot;Tell me, Commander, can denizens drink hot 
chocolate?&quot; she asked fuzzily. 

Tolaris blinked and looked at Ami. She nodded her head, giving him 
what some would call an evil grin. &quot;Umm, I think we can,&quot; he said 
slowly, giving Ami an odd look. 

&quot;Okay, thanks,&quot; she said and went into the kitchen. 

Everyone exchanged glances and Luna sighed heavily. &quot;Artemis, have we 
found another way to make their sigils start to glow like that or is 
it what I think it is?&quot; she said wearily. 

&quot;Do you really want me to answer that?&quot; 

&quot;Actually, no....&quot; she replied and curled up into an even smaller 
ball. 

Mina returned in short order holding two steaming cups of hot 
chocolate. She paused and smiled rather dreamily at the group. &quot;Is 
anyone planning any sort of group activity tonight?&quot; 

&quot;No, but remember that you and the rest of us have school in the 
morning,&quot; Ami said, eliciting groans from Serena, Rei, and Leda. 

&quot;Mmm, forgot about that. But that&#39;s in the morning right?&quot; Mina 
replied, still slightly lost in her afterglow. 

&quot;Yes....&quot; 

&quot;Okay, I guess we&#39;ll see you in the morning, then,&quot; she replied and 
made her way back to the room she was sharing with Maze. 

Leda sighed. &quot;I didn&#39;t need to see that. Anyway, sleep well, everyone, 
and I&#39;ll see you whenever I wake up,&quot; she said and left the room. 
There was a chorus of &#39;good nights&#39; in her wake and stood up to 
stretch. 

&quot;A wise idea,&quot; the priestess said and gathered her things together, 
still keeping a wary eye on the apparently dozing weaver. 

&quot;I think we all could use some sleep,&quot; Whisper said as she too stood 
up to stretch. &quot;Do you think you&#39;ll be okay enough on your own, 
Lieutenant?&quot; 

Ra&#39;vel chirped a reply and scooped up a cat in each arm, telepathing a 
question to each of them. They both blinked in surprise and glanced at 
each other. 

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t have any problem with keeping her company,&quot; Luna said. 

&quot;Neither do I, really,&quot; Artemis replied. &quot;Why the interest in us?&quot; 

The avian chirped for several seconds and Tolaris laughed. &quot;She likes 
you two because you&#39;re soft, fuzzy and warm.&quot; 

Ra&#39;vel stroked Luna and the cat found herself purring instinctively, 
much to the avian&#39;s delight. &quot;Well, I think I can handle that,&quot; the 
cat said with a small smile. Ra&#39;vel chirped for a few seconds before 
she got up and carried the two cats down the hall towards her room. 

&quot;Just between you and me, Commander, I seriously think that having 
those two to play with will speed up her recovery. There seems to be 
something very therapeutic about stroking a pet that does wonders for 
both the mind and the body. And after a day like today, she really 
needs it,&quot; Whisper said softly. 

Darian nodded and gently stroked Serena&#39;s neck. &quot;I hope it can work 
both ways. Artemis really seems to be bummed about something.&quot; 

Ami sighed. &quot;Artemis loves Mina like a brother, and its hard for him 
to come to terms with the fact that she&#39;s fallen in love with someone. 
It&#39;s been just the two of them for quite some time, ever since she 
became Sailor V. And now that she has Maze, he fears that she&#39;ll 
forget about him or abandon him.&quot; 

Whisper nodded. &quot;Hopefully he&#39;ll adjust to the point where he won&#39;t 
look so despondent. Anyway, good night everyone, and I&#39;ll see you in 
the morning.&quot; 

&quot;Good night, Captain,&quot; Tolaris said and was quietly echoed by the 
others. He looked up to find that only Darian, Serena, Ami, and 
himself remained in the cathedral&#39;s living room. &quot;Hard to believe that 
it&#39;s only two in the afternoon and everyone&#39;s going to bed.&quot; 

&quot;So we had a really rough day,&quot; Darian chuckled. 

Serena reached up and pulled his head down so she could kiss him 
tenderly. &quot;So carry me to bed so we can relax in peace and comfort,&quot; 
she said softly as she nuzzled his neck. 

Darian blushed and glanced up to see Ami smiling knowingly at him. 
&quot;Umm, what?&quot; he said hesitantly. 

Ami laughed and cuddled up closer to Tolaris. &quot;Go on, take her to bed 
and see that you both get comfortable. While you may not feel it right 
now, your muscles are rather worn out and need to be rested up. 
Otherwise, you&#39;ll really feel it in the morning.&quot; 

Darian chuckled softly as he picked Serena up in his arms and stood 
up. &quot;C&#39;mon, meatball head, Doctor Sterling here says to make sure you 
get nice and comfortable. Don&#39;t want to disregard medical advice, now 
do we?&quot; 

Ami giggled. &quot;Well, if that&#39;s the way you want it, I&#39;m going to 
prescribe an order of hot chocolate for each of you. Granted it&#39;s a 
mild stimulant, but I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t do much aside from keeping you 
awake in a pleasantly relaxed state. Unlike Maze,&quot; she added with a 
grin. 

Tolaris blinked and regarded Ami carefully. &quot;Should I ask what you 
mean?&quot; 

Ami gave him a rather seductive smile. &quot;Well, with Mina being the hot 
chocoholic that she is, it will hardly affect her. Maze, on the other 
hand, is a denizen so the chocolate will affect him differently.&quot; 

The Dragoon frowned. &quot;And how does it affect denizens?&quot; 

&quot;Instead of acting as a mild stimulant, it acts as an aphrodisiac.&quot; 

Serena and Darian exchanged glances before snickering to themselves. 
Ami merely smiled suggestively at Tolaris and the denizen sighed 
heavily. &quot;If I didn&#39;t love you so much, Ami, you would frighten me 
rather badly,&quot; he said with a wry grin. 

Darian laughed and carried Serena into the kitchen to make a large pot 
of hot chocolate. &quot;Should I ask how you two plan to spend the rest of 
the evening? Not that it&#39;s really any of my business, but I was just 
wondering if we should keep the storm shutters closed....&quot; 

&quot;Darian!&quot; Serena exclaimed from inside the kitchen. 

Ami was about to reply when Tolaris bent down and began to kiss her 
tender throat. &quot;Perhaps, Darian, but I still have one final loose end 
to tie up this evening,&quot; he said after making Ami start to quiver 
slightly. 

Serena came back out of the kitchen, holding a pair of cups in one 
hand and the pot of hot chocolate in the other, still being carried 
affectionately by Darian. &quot;Commander,&quot; Serena said softly, &quot;I&#39;d like 
to thank you for taking us with you. If you hadn&#39;t, I don&#39;t think I 
would have ever gotten to know who my father really was....&quot; 

Tolaris nodded and hugged Ami tightly. &quot;If the Sailor Scouts hadn&#39;t 
been there with me, I don&#39;t think I would have made it. Serena....&quot; he 
said slowly, &quot;The name Raijen commands the utmost respect among the 
Dragoons. I think that they would also have the same respect for his 
daughter. Should you ever return to the Negaverse again, you may find 
that you have more friends than you would ever imagine. Good night, 
Serena.&quot; 

Serena smiled softly and nodded. &quot;Thank you for everything, Commander. 
Good night, you two,&quot; she said. Darian nodded towards Ami and Tolaris 
and then quietly carried Serena off to their room. 

Ami sighed and leaned back across Tolaris&#39;s lap. &quot;So what is this 
final task you have to do?&quot; she asked, idly toying with the buttons to 
his tunic. 

Tolaris smiled and softly kissed her. &quot;Only to pay final respects to 
one of the few people I could ever call a friend,&quot; he said. 

&quot;Mmm, but you said you were going to wait until nightfall to do that?&quot; 

Tolaris smiled. &quot;Yes. Should I bother asking why you were asking?&quot; 

Ami reached up and unbuttoned the top button to her blouse. &quot;Well, I 
was just wondering what we could do in the meantime. I&#39;m afraid that 
it won&#39;t be anything too strenuous, as we both need to heal and I&#39;m 
being made a slave to feminine biology again, but we can still cuddle 
for awhile....&quot; she suggested and drew him down to her. 

&quot;I think I can accommodate....&quot; he said and let his lips begin the 
lengthy and pleasurable process of wandering across her body, starting 
at her lips and slowly working its way downward along exposed skin. It 
wasn&#39;t very long before he had his work cut out for him, as very 
little skin was left that didn&#39;t wind up exposed to both him and the 
flickering firelight.... 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Molly sighed as she tossed and turned in bed. I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s 
been almost a year since he died, she thought, yet it still feels as 
if it had only happened yesterday. She sighed again, wondering if he 
would come to her in her dreams again. 

She blinked as a shadow fell across the wall at the far end of the 
room. &quot;What? Who&#39;s there?&quot; she called out hesitantly. 

&quot;Molly Baker?&quot; asked a gentle voice. 

&quot;Yes....&quot; 

The figure stepped into the room and closed the balcony door behind 
him. &quot;Forgive me for visiting you at this hour, Miss Baker. I am 
Dragoon Commander Tolaris. I am.... was a friend of General 
Nephlyte&#39;s.&quot; 

Molly bolted upright, not believing that she had heard him right. 
&quot;What? You knew Nephlyte?&quot; She blinked and took a closer look at him 
and his dark uniform. &quot;You&#39;re from the Negaverse!&quot; 

Tolaris nodded. &quot;Yes, I am. I&#39;ve come here to return something that I 
believe rightfully belongs to you,&quot; he said and handed her the dark 
crystal he was holding. 

As she reached out and touched it, the strange crystal started to hum 
and glow a soft shade of blue. &quot;What? This is Nephlyte&#39;s crystal!&quot; she 
said, not believing her own eyes. &quot;But I thought it had been taken by 
another person from the Negaverse.&quot; 

&quot;It had been, but I&#39;ve retrieved it for you. No one will come looking 
for it now, as it no longer has a use to them.&quot; Tolaris stepped back 
and gave her a curious look. &quot;Do you know why it reacts to you so?&quot; he 
said, gesturing to the crystal and its odd blue light. 

Molly shook her head. &quot;No, and Nephlyte said he couldn&#39;t figure it out 
earlier. Do you know why?&quot; 

&quot;No, but it may have something to do with how the crystal was forged.&quot; 

She nodded and pressed the crystal to her chest, remembering the last 
few minutes she and Nephlyte spent together before he died. She 
blinked as she felt an odd warmth surging through the crystal and 
looked down at it in wonder. &quot;Is.... is it alive?&quot; 

&quot;No, but part of Nephlyte&#39;s soul still exists inside,&quot; the Dragoon 
said softly. &quot;Molly, I want you to know something. A long time ago, I 
too had my soul trapped in crystal. It was because of love that I was 
freed, and there exists the possibility that one day your love will be 
able to free Nephlyte.&quot; 

She looked up at him in disbelief, tears of hope starting to form in 
her green eyes. &quot;Do you really mean it? Can he be brought back?&quot; 

&quot;Perhaps he can, someday,&quot; Tolaris said. &quot;But that day would be far 
off in the future for I don&#39;t know of any power that can reunite the 
soul with the body after death. I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t do more, Molly.&quot; 

Molly smiled and looked up at him, a single tear sliding down her 
cheek. &quot;You&#39;ve done enough for me as it is, Commander. You&#39;ve not only 
given to me a reminder of his presence and love for me, but you&#39;ve 
also given me hope. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be able to thank you 
enough.&quot; 

&quot;You are welcome,&quot; he said as he quietly made his way out of the room. 
&quot;Perhaps we shall meet again in the future. Someday. Sleep well, 
Molly, and pleasant dreams,&quot; he said and disappeared into the night 
before she could say anything in reply. 

She looked down at the crystal and smiled as the odd warmth started to 
flow through her body once more. She laid back down on the bed, still 
holding the mysterious Star Crystal in her hand. Her heart at ease, 
she slid into a world of dreams. Her dreams were no longer shadows of 
the past, but memories and dreams that she hoped would one day become 
part of the future.
