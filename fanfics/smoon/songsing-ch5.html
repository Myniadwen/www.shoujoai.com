<p><u>“<em>What  I see – v.”</em></u></p>
<p><em>Moments  before...</em></p>
<p><em>--</em></p>
<p>“..Do you know  them?”</p>
<p>Rei glanced  towards the rear-view mirror.</p>
<p>“If I said I  did, will you shut up?”</p>
<p>The driver,  Ishikawa, drummed his fingers about the steering wheel pondering the  question.</p>
<p>“More than  likely, not.”</p>
<p>“Then. No. I  don’t know them,” paused Rei – taking a furtive look about the  neighborhood. “A left here, then right – stop at the Church.”</p>
<p>He nodded.   “Well, she’s famous you know, not sure about him.”</p>
<p>“Really.”</p>
<p>“Hai – She  looks to be about your age – surprised you don’t know her. She’s  in Japan for a concert...” <em>now or never</em>, thought Ishikawa,  “I’ve got tickets maybe...”</p>
<p>“no.”</p>
<p>“...If you’re  worried about my age, it’s nothing! NOTHING! It’s nothing but a  number – it’ll be fun!”</p>
<p>“I work for the  government – <em>fun­ </em>is not in my vocabulary,” lied Rei.   If only to get him to quiet.</p>
<p>Then something  dawned on him; luckily a stoplight at an intersection had flickered  red. It allowed him to turn about and regard his client. He wasn’t  prepared he was blinded by her sheer beauty – Though his angel was  obviously Japanese, he assumed that she was born in the United States  – she didn’t quite act like a Japanese woman. Ishikawa inhaled  sharply. The miko arced a slender, perfectly sculpted brow  questioningly.</p>
<p>“What,” urged  Rei – uncomfortable at being gawked at.</p>
<p>“Ah gomen,”  he blurted. “Seeing how <em>she’s</em> a star - I bet <em>that</em> was your boyfriend, ne? She stole him ne? Is that why you’re so  angry?”</p>
<p>This astounded  Rei. Were she not irritated perhaps she would have acknowledged how  imbecilic the notion sounded; she would have laughed. But the weight  of emotions was still raw in her. With her thumb and her forefinger,  the raven-haired priestess rubbed the bridge of her nose. She could  feel the tickle of a headache creeping from the base of her neck on  up. Looking up, salvation showed in an opulent blue-green, prompting  traffic to move.</p>
<p>“The light’s  changed, just...please drive.”</p>
<p>Ishikawa hit the  nail on the head, so he thought – His fiery angel had been hurt.   He would do what he could to help mend those wounds, if only she  could just open her heart...But complying the driver guided the hard  working Daihatsu towards its final destination. Rei slipped from the  cab none too soon.</p>
<p>“As much as  this pains me to ask, would you mind waiting here – it’ll only  take a moment, Ishikawa-san.”</p>
<p>He looked to her  with hopeful eyes – <em>she’s opening herself to me...</em></p>
<p>“I will wait  for you for as long as you want, miss.”</p>
<p>Not wanting to  waste anymore of her breath, lest she keel over from hyperventilating  – Rei just rolled her eyes. Less effort.</p>
<p>A flower vendor  was situated just out the rusted gates of the Church. Pausing for  only a minute or two the miko had acquired a bounty of red roses.  They were similar in breed to what her mother, Hino Risa had planted  so long ago. Rei gently freed a singular long stemmed rose, lifting  it to her nostrils. The fragrance was subtle, just like her mother  liked them to be. Cradling the free rose in the palm of her able  hand, the miko traversed the massive expanse of the Church grounds.   It was amazing how well she knew this place after being gone so long.</p>
<p>Her head still  carried a gentle throb – another aggravating episode would do more  than set it off. But at least here, nothing would go wrong. Rei’s  feet carried her towards the rear of the massive edifice. Rounding  the corner, Rei had to reel herself backward before she was seen.  Suddenly, the headache formed into something a bit more excruciating  to bear. Pressing her back against the mossy kissed walls of the  Church the miko carefully stole a more scrutinizing look upon the  intruder at her mother’s grave.</p>
<p><em>Shit.</em></p>
<p>The star sat  there clearing the debris from her mother’s grave. Rei couldn’t  understand why. Rei hadn’t mentioned anything in regards to her  mother to Minako. But there she sat, conversing as if it were the  simplest thing to do. As if she had the passage of right to immerse  herself in other’s lives.</p>
<p><em>As if she’s  always belonged there.</em></p>
<p>The auburneqsue  haired woman tendered forth a gentle smile over her lips. Soft,  blushed colored lips that spoke words to the miko’s long dead  mother. Rei swore she heard the gentle trill of her mama’s  laughter ring over the caress of wind that had blanketed the  cemetery.</p>
<p><em>Oh. NOW  they’re sharing secrets.</em></p>
<p>Minako’s lips  parted once more – her hands were clasped together as if in prayer.   God, everything about her was perfect! PERFECT. She lived a charmed  existence, adoring fans, with a voice of an angel and someone that <em>she</em> chose to spend her life <em>with. </em>To Rei – Minako was  someone that was elevated from a mortal existence to that of a  Goddess, the icon was always a different breed from her. Though in  their younger years, Rei stood a better chance at touching the divine  than now.</p>
<p>The dark haired  priestess watched as Minako continued to pray. Not long before those  lips were tainted with her lover’s own. <em>Sinfully perfect lips.</em> The recent memory was ingrained in Rei. Images of their bodies  entwined sent the miko’s mind seething.</p>
<p><em>How dare she  come here...</em></p>
<p>Stepping from the  shadows, Rei quietly made her way to the grave.</p>
<p>“I didn’t  know stars prayed,” spat the dark haired priestess. As if she were  removed from her earthly form, Rei heard her voice – deep, grating.   Accusatory.</p>
<p>Minako didn’t  move. All for the better – one look from the starlet and Rei knew  she would have decimated into pure nothingness. It was difficult  enough to just to be near her shadow. Rei’s head wouldn’t stop  screaming. Her body moved on its own accord, drawing herself closer  to the icon. Something she <em>logically</em> had not wanted to do.   Rei was just alongside her now. Her nostrils flared with the tiniest  hint of Minako’s scent. It was an intoxicating stew of Chamomile  and Lavender. She wondered how her <em>natural</em> scent contrasted.</p>
<p>Sparing no glance  to the worldly star, Rei affixed her eyes on the weathered stone  placemarker of her mother’s final resting place, “Mama, gomenasai  – Some people have no concept of ‘rest in peace’.”</p>
<p>There was a sharp  inhalation of breath – Minako’s breathing had quickened. That  was the <em>only </em>thing Rei heard. Had her tongue failed the  Singer?</p>
<p><em>Give me more  than this, Songbird – I deserve more than just sharing the same  time and the same air with you...</em></p>
<p>Finally,  Rei’s gaze slid to her right appraising Minako carefully. The  Singer’s hands were married together in nervous fashion.   Irritably, Rei stabbed the freed rose she still held, towards Minako.   “Bearing no gifts as well...Is that an American way of thinking?<em> Here – </em>The least you can give  her – my mother’s favorite.”</p>
<p>Minako  took the bait – Rei had to be careful, she didn’t want to be  burned by the Singer’s touch. She didn’t want to share Minako’s  flesh with the residue of the icon’s lover still freshly clinging  to Minako’s supple skin. Rei rose to her feet turning herself  around, at this point the Singer would have said something...anything  to warrant a rebuttal on her behalf. Yet Minako remained composed.</p>
<p><em>So unlike her.   But...you hardly know her now Rei.</em></p>
<p>In  blinding lividness, Rei murmured out, “Am I that below you that you  won’t <em>speak</em> to me...”  the miko trailed, afraid to say her name – even just a whisper of  it would betray her. But the decision wasn’t hers. The Fates were  against her today, her lips formed the taboo name before she knew  what happened, “...Minako,” much to the miko’s bewilderment the  Singer’s name felt comfortable flowing from her. Like it fit hand  to glove.</p>
<p>Minako  sputtered her reply. <em>First blood drawn</em>.   Rei felt sated – she wasn’t the only one affected by this  impromptu meeting. A ghost of a smirk drew onto her countenance.   Tit for tat, both women spoke for the first time in years. For Rei,  she was empowered – Each counter she gave had seemingly touched a  frayed nerve in the singer. The conversation wasn’t noteworthy  until the end...</p>
<p>Both  women finally had turned to face the other. Rei was taken aback.   But far be it from her to <em>show</em> it. Minako had surpassed the title of her senshi alt. She had <em>become</em> the Goddess of  Beauty. Even behind the guise of her outing wear Aino Minako failed  in hiding that fact. It took all of her composure to not buckle  before the woman. The miko used her own helplessness at Minako’s <em>hands, </em>to fuel her  simmering anger.</p>
<p>Minako  had always been Rei’s weakness. And this...Rei couldn’t have.</p>
<p>“...Or  is this your expert opinion,” hissed the miko in finality. Another  wound inflicted but this time about, the Minako of old surfaced.</p>
<p>“If  you need mental assessment, fine I’ll pay for your treatment.  But...I’m already late as it stands,” Rei burrowed her intense  gaze unto the singer, unrelenting – none the less, Minako had fired  back, “If you can weed out which persona is more sociable –  you’re welcomed to join the rest of us. If not...” commented the  singer.</p>
<p>Rei  should have negated the invitation. Pride be damned.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p><em>Now...at the  park...</em></p>
<p>He  was the type of student that upperclassmen fed on – A half breed,  they would call him. Not quite dark chocolate, not quite vanilla  wafer – Just another product of interracial genes; an outcast.   Meek and studious – he was marked as the <em>uncool</em>.   Cheerleaders would pass him in the hallways of Roosevelt High  School and literally looked through him – to them, he was naught  but a phantom. His only escape then was the love of anime and  Japanese Pop. Especially the Pop-music of an up and coming idol that  JUST touched the shores of the United States at that time. Terry had  obsessed over her since the feverish hit <em>C’est La Vie</em> took the globe by storm.</p>
<p>Terry  made a promise to himself after watching one of her very first  interviews. She loved athletics the translator had said and she  couldn’t settle for anything less than the goals she had set for  herself. Aino Minako would always surpass herself.</p>
<p>So  would he.</p>
<p>Now...he  was sinewy, well toned – a perfect machine suited for the grid  iron. Light brown eyes danced to and fro – looking from one  opponent to the next. <em>They</em> didn’t stand a chance. Terry knew. Skinnier and untrained, he  would <em>own</em> them. He  regarded the especially nervous, wiry one to his right. Motoki, so  he was called. Makoto’s fiancée. Terry promised the  pony-tailed Japanese woman that he wouldn’t hurt him...<em>much. </em>The guy needed <em>some</em> schooling though. Terry took it upon himself to help those he felt,  were people just like he was...Helpless.</p>
<p>“Blue  43...blue 43, hut...hut...HUT!”</p>
<p>Terry  doubled back and as he planned his receivers arced wide, evading  their would be blockers. It was an XX versus XY chromosome battle,  Ami had been planted on Motoki instead of Makoto. Otherwise the man  wouldn’t have his wits about him. He had to admit, the good doctor  was <em>quick</em>.   Still...Terry had to try for it.</p>
<p>He  pumped once...Twice...he had to hurry, Usagi managed to throw Mamoru  off breaking through the line. Her arms were flailing madly. Terry  found himself in trouble. Digging his fingers into the Nerf  football, the mulatto let it loose.</p>
<p>Usagi  vaguely unaware of what was going on down the field only had one  thought. <em>Tackle.</em> She  put every energetic reserve into it...but only served with her just  bouncing off Terry’s solid form. Landing upon her rear, the young  mother let a whimpered, “Itai!” out.</p>
<p>The  Football player blinked down to the source, “Oh <em>shit!</em> Usagi, you okay?”</p>
<p>As  he extended his hand to her, he heard Mamoru let out an exalted cry –  He looked up, fist pumping into the Japan crisp afternoon sky. Motoki  had caught the ball; but he had been tackled by Ami soonafter. Of  course the very hand that was offered to aid Usagi had gone away,  sending the odango headed woman back to the earth with an  unceremonious <em>thud.</em></p>
<p>He  grit his teeth offering a slew of apologies now affording his  attentions back onto Usagi. She politely shook her head, telling him  it was okay – He loved the Japanese for this, it’s the customary  niceties that made him fall deeper in love with the country. The  rest of the group jogged their way back. Mopping his face with a  massive paw, the clean-shaven Football star glanced to the timepiece  hugging his wrist, “Almost time for lunch – break?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,  good a time as any – we’re about to beat you all anyway,”  chortled Mamoru.</p>
<p>“You  haven’t even scored yet!”</p>
<p>“Dunno  ‘bout that Usagi,” corrected Makoto, canting her head towards the  baby-bouncer with ChibiUsa nested in its center, “Mmm...I think he  already <em>did.</em>”</p>
<p>“Mako-chan!”</p>
<p>The  tall woman grinned devilishly. Motoki lobbed the ball towards Terry  who in turn caught it with practiced ease.</p>
<p>“Good  goin’ buddy – now y’got somethin’ else t’brag about other  than your Turtle collection,” jibed Terry. But after a moment or  two, the mulatto glanced towards his watch, all before feeling a  gentle hand come to rest on his forearm. Usagi was grinning up to  him.</p>
<p>“She’s  a big girl you know, Terry-chan.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,  I know, just ain’t never gotten used to bein’ apart from her.”</p>
<p>With  a consolatory smile, Usagi offered, “It hurts being apart for even  a little while...but...you know she’ll <em>always</em> come back to you. I can see that Minako-chan cares for you deeply.”</p>
<p>At  that, Terry rubbed at the butt of his chin, nodding in affirmation –  grateful for the reassurance, “You speak the truth, thanks shorty.”</p>
<p>Hooking  her arms about one of Terry’s own, she tugged him towards the rest  of the group, already nestled in place upon the portable tatami mats  Ami had brought along.</p>
<p>“GOOD!  You have to try a new recipe that I learned from my mother. Cuttle  fish omlette cakes!”, proudly announced the domesticated Usagi.</p>
<p>But  even before he could offer verbal ye or nay to the exotic, albeit  maybe poisonous morsel, not too far in the distance a very audible  slamming of a vehicle door resounded towards their direction.   Curious gazes drifted towards the source.</p>
<p>“What  in the...”</p>
<p>The  sun beat down on the party relentlessly, but the weather was still  rather cool. Despite that, Terry had to use the flat of his hand to  shade his eyes. Two figures ambled towards the lot, obviously  bickering amongst themselves. At some point they had stopped and  turned to face one another.</p>
<p>“...<em>That’s</em> not changed,” remarked Mamoru.</p>
<p>“Whozat?”</p>
<p>“Minako’s  best friend.”</p>
<p>“You’re...kidding  right? They’re about to gorge each other’s eyes out.”</p>
<p>“Differences  make for good spark.”, shrugged Mamoru, “They were <em>close</em> a long while ago. They never had a sense of peace between  them...Their relationship had always been, <em>raw.</em>”</p>
<p>Terry  nodded slowly.</p>
<p>A  high pitched squeal erupted from the picnic cloth, Usagi and the two  others were besides themselves, calling out for their companions.   The hulking male kept his gaze affixed on the two newly arrived  women. He was inwardly glad at Minako’s arrival, but that dark  haired woman, the one with the intense gaze. She rubbed him the wrong  way. The girls eventually having reacquainted themselves, wended  their way back to the epicenter. He caught the latter half of the  conversation.</p>
<p>“...And  she was as heartless as ever, turning the driver down. He was  smitten with her.”</p>
<p>Rei  rolled her eyes, “he was a lecher. That’s all there was to it.   Besides – he lost his self control as soon as <em>she,</em>”  motioning with an errant wave of her hand towards Minako, “Stowed  into the cab.”</p>
<p>“Everyone  loves themselves some Minako, ain’t that right baby?” Terry  joined. His hands quickly sought out the Singer, pulling her  immediately to him. He received a chaste kiss in greeting before he  asked, “So...who’s your friend.” Terry’s gaze turned onto  Rei. “Thought I met all the <em>family</em> members...” He lifted his mammoth hand and eased it forth.</p>
<p>Minako  looked from Terry towards Rei, murmuring softly, “Terry Lapps...”  there was a purposely placed pause, slight as it was. Terry heard  the hitch in Minako’s voice. <em>Something</em> had made the Singer uncomfortable. And the only <em>change </em>was  the newest entrant into the party.</p>
<p>“My...Rei”,  Minako fumbled – recovering quickly, “...My friend Rei, Rei  Hino,” finally afforded Minako, in a quick utterance at best.</p>
<p>To  Terry, his lover seemed, distracted for some odd reason. It worried  him. His eyes regarded Rei, his hand still outstretched. The  raven-haired woman was <em>very</em> attractive, a sort of tomboyish sort of appeal, unlike the femininity  Minako portrayed. She glanced to the hand before delicately, yet  firmly grasping his. An odd sort of jolt rocked through his hand. A  tingle.</p>
<p>“Pleased,”  replied Rei in English.</p>
<p>“Coo’...coo’...”,  murmured Terry in reply – relaxing into his American twang.   Pulling back, he clapped his hands together, “We’re about to eat  – if you’re up for it, we could play some ball after,” now  fully neglecting the Japanese dialect as he continued to speak to  Rei.</p>
<p>Rei  shrugged casually and nodded, “I’m game.”</p>
<p>“Great.”   Lacing his thick digits with Minako’s dainty ones, he pulled her  towards a little patch of grassy knoll. A plate was already prepared  for the both of them to share. As she settled herself, Terry glanced  up catching Minako side-eyeing Rei. Who had settled along side Ami.  “You okay babe?”</p>
<p>Minako  plucked a piece of cheese from the paper plate that he was offering,  “Mm? Nothing, just...a bit distracted. The crew called?”</p>
<p>Terry  nodded, “Yeah, they checked into a hotel an hour ago, gonna do some  soundchecks tomorrow, if you’re up for it.”</p>
<p>Licking  her fingers free of excess, Minako nodded, “Good, glad.” Her  eyes once more searched. Finding their target, Terry’s own latched  onto the victim.</p>
<p>Rei  now had moved towards the babbling baby, the miko’s eyes had  flickered towards Minako as well. As soon as their eyes met, both  had looked away.</p>
<p>“...you  sure you’re friends?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You  and she. You two were getting into it leaving that cab.”</p>
<p>“She  was just being Rei.”</p>
<p>“And <em>that</em> means?”</p>
<p>Minako  laughed uneasily, “I’m sorry – Rei’s a private person, I was  questioning her too much, pushed her, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“On?”</p>
<p>The  star shrugged, thumbing a blade of grass at her feet – finding it  utterly fascinating before she tendered out a reply, “I...asked her  why she hadn’t written or called me, that’s all.”</p>
<p>“And  she said...?”</p>
<p>“She  shrugged” Another  unsteady laugh, “Typical reply for her,” murmuring before she  lifted her eyes to regard her lover.</p>
<p>That  was the first time Minako had lied to him. He had the utmost faith  that she would tell him the truth when she was ready. For now, he  let the issue drop. His eyes traveled to rest on the raven headed  woman, just across the way. She had the child nestled on her lap,  spoon feeding her; Rei had transformed herself from that wary eyed  bitch...to a cooing fool.</p>
<p>At  that moment, Terry Lapps decided – he didn’t like Hino Rei much  and someone...had to take her down a notch.</p>
