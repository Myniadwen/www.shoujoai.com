----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Rini walked briskly back to her dressing room. She had
another scene she had to do in a little while and she had to change
costume. She sighed. Acting was hard work, but it was her passion.
Acting and a sweet dark haired girl.
	Rini&#146;s mind drifted as she started thinking about Tara. At first
she&#146;d been a little wary of the shy, introverted girl. When she&#146;d first
met her on the set, she&#146;d barely managed to get the dark haired girl to
look up at her. She&#146;d read the script and knew she&#146;d be having a lot of
scenes with her, so she wanted to get to know her better before they&#146;d
be acting together. She thought it would be impossible with how shy
the other girl was.
	Gradually things had changed. Tara had quickly gained Rini&#146;s
respect as she watched the other girl act. She came to look forward to
her scenes with the dark haired girl, enjoying working with her. As
time went on, they spent more and more time together on and off the
set. Rini had slowly managed to work past the other girl&#146;s shyness and
got to find out about what was behind the facade. She found everything
about the dark haired girl fascinating. From the books she read to what
her favorite food was to what she dreamed about.
	Everyone had thought her first kiss was onstage when an
episode called for her to, but her real first kiss had been weeks before
that with that dark haired beauty. It had been heaven. Rini smiled at the
memory. They&#146;d started dating a while before that, but neither was
ready to make the first move. She&#146;d surprised that shy girl when they&#146;d
kissed. Rini had been almost as surprised when she&#146;d felt the other girl
kiss back. It had felt like&#133; what was the saying? Fireworks. Thousands
of fireworks going off at once for the two girls. It still felt like that
every time they kissed.
	Rini looked around absentmindedly for the door to her
dressing room, lost in thought. She shook her head to think clearly and
finally stepped in. She stretched as she looked around the small room.
It was small, but she&#146;d grown accustomed to it. It was pretty
comfortable for her. That was probably because of quick naps she&#146;d
had to take when filming went late. As she let her hair down from the
odango hair style she&#146;d had it in all day, she noticed something near the
mirror. ChibiUsa&#146;s heart swooned as she picked up the roses. &#147;Oh,
Tara&#133;&#148; she sighed. She sniffed the lovely fragrance of the roses and
giggled to herself. She couldn&#146;t wait to see the other girl later.
	Rini froze when she heard a knock at the door. She smiled
brightly at the thought of her love. &#147;Come on in!&#148; Her smile faded
when the door opened. Rather than the love of her life, it was another
one of the actresses, Erika. She was a friend, but Rini had gotten all
worked up over nothing.
	&#147;Hey! Don&#146;t worry about getting ready yet. This Inner Senshi
scene seems to be taking a lot longer than they&#146;d expected. They won&#146;t
be doing your scene for at least an hour. The director sent me over to
tell you.&#148;
	Rini mustered a smile. &#147;Thanks, Erika.&#148;
	The tall blonde smiled back at her. She motioned to the roses
still in the pink haired girl&#146;s arms. &#147;An adoring fan?&#148; she asked
teasingly.
	Rini stuck her tongue out. &#147;You know who they&#146;re from.&#148; She
walked over to the mirror and set the flowers down. &#147;Where is Tara,
anyway?&#148;
	&#147;I&#146;m not sure. I can ask Michelle if you want,&#148; Erika offered. 
&#147;She might have seen her.&#148;
	&#147;Thanks. If you see her&#133;&#148;
	&#147;I&#146;ll send her this way,&#148; Erika finished. She laughed. She
waved to Rini and shut the door before heading off.
	Rini stood alone in the now silent room thinking to herself.
After a minute, she picked up a pen and paper and wrote down a quick
note just in case Tara stopped by the dressing room again. She left the
note where she hoped Tara would see it and then walked out the door.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Tara was sitting on one of the benches in the park set. No one
was there, so she had the whole place to herself. She found it relaxing.
She finally had a chance to read. She knew she should be reading the
script instead, but the book she was in the middle of was too engrossing
to put down. She had a sinking feeling in her stomach that she should
be doing something, but she pushed that to the side, thinking it was the
script. She&#146;d read it enough so far. She should do fine.
	As she turned the page, her vision was abruptly obscured. She
felt the two small hands placed over her eyes and a warm body pressed
against her. She sighed happily and leaned back against the other girl.
	&#147;Hi, Rini.&#148;
	The pink haired girl giggled. &#147;I&#146;m supposed to say guess
who.&#148; Her hands went down from the girls eyes and clasped around the
dark haired girl&#146;s stomach. Her chin rested on Hotaru&#146;s shoulder. &#147;I&#146;ve
been looking all over for you,&#148; She said more seriously.
	&#147;I&#146;m sorry. I was going to come see you earlier, but I lost track
of time.&#148; Tara&#146;s hand stroked the other girl&#146;s cheek before running
through her shoulder length pink hair. &#147;I&#146;ll remember next time.&#148;
	Rini laughed. &#147;I&#146;m sure you will.&#148; She nuzzled the dark
haired girl&#146;s neck lovingly. &#147;I&#146;m just glad I found you before I had to
go on.&#148;
	&#147;Don&#146;t go,&#148; Tara said simply.
	&#147;But I need to finish a scene.&#148;
	&#147;If they don&#146;t find you, they can finish a different scene today.
Things have been pretty hectic all day. No one will mind if you don&#146;t
show up. And I&#146;d be much happier if you don&#146;t.&#148; Tara&#146;s fingers trailed
down to Rini&#146;s chin. She turned the other girl so that their lips were
inches apart. They moved at the same instant, their soft lips meeting.
Tara&#146;s fingers intertwined in the other girls light pink hair as the kiss
grew more passionate. Their tongues brushed against each other as they
lost themselves to the moment. They were finally alone.
	When they pulled away, they were both breathing heavily.
	&#147;You&#146;re right. Nobody will mind,&#148; Rini said quickly.
	Tara smiled at the pink haired girl. &#147;You are so cute.&#148;
	Rini mock pouted. &#147;Cute? I need to stop dressing like my
character.&#148;
	Tara giggled. &#147;What&#146;s wrong with that? I like cute.&#148; The two
leaned towards each other and kissed again. Tara stood up quickly.
&#147;Come on.&#148; She tugged at the pink haired girl&#146;s hand. Rini stood up
and followed as Tara led her away from the park set.
	&#147;Where are we going?&#148; Rini asked. Tara just smiled and
walked faster. They finally arrived at the set of Hotaru&#146;s bedroom. Rini
just looked confused.
	Tara smiled mischievously. She whispered to the other girl
seductively. &#147;I&#146;m sorry I didn&#146;t show up earlier. Can I make up for it?&#148;
Rini swallowed, her throat suddenly dry. The dark haired girl
always managed to affect her like this.
	Tara lay down on the bed after slipping off her shoes. Rini
leaned down and kissed her soft lips, her hand gently running up and
down Tara&#146;s leg, the thin cloth of the girl&#146;s stockings the only thing
between them. She slowly started pulling the stockings down the other
girl&#146;s shapely legs. Rini felt Tara&#146;s fingers unbuttoning her blouse.
	Rini climbed onto the bed on top of the other girl, never
stopping their sweet kiss. Rini finally slipped one of the stockings off
Tara&#146;s small foot, tossing it behind the two of them. Her fingers slid
under the cloth of Tara&#146;s other stocking, the cloth pushing her hand
tightly against Tara&#146;s warm flesh. Rini moaned as Tara&#146;s hands cupped
her breasts through the soft cotton bra. Her hands shakily unclasped the
bra, the fire within her growing uncontrollably. Tara&#146;s other stocking
quickly joined the first on the floor. Rini sucked in a sudden breath of
air as she felt Tara&#146;s hands against her breasts. Rini&#146;s hand traveled up
Tara&#146;s now bare legs. She continued on up under the dark haired girl&#146;s
skirt. She slipped Tara&#146;s panties down. Tara kicked them off when they
reached her feet. She felt Rini&#146;s fingers brush against her inner thigh as
they moved upward. Tara gasped as Rini&#146;s fingers touched her most
private of places.
	The pink haired girl moaned softly as Tara continued to
massage her breasts. Tara&#146;s fingers danced over Rini&#146;s pink nipples.
Her fingers circled one of the nipples, the pink bud hardening as she
directed her attention on it. Tara&#146;s other hand slid down Rini&#146;s smooth
stomach, her fingertips inching across the other&#146;s skin, slowly enough
to savor the feel of the soft flesh while driving the pink haired girl
crazy. &#147;Tara&#133;&#148; Rini whimpered as her lover&#146;s hand continued with
agonizing slowness. After passing Rini&#146;s naval, Tara&#146;s pace quickened
as she felt her the other girl&#146;s fingers rubbing up and down against her
swollen labia. Rini slowly parted Tara&#146;s petals and slid a finger inside
the dark haired girl&#146;s entrance.
	&#147;Rini&#133; Oh, Rini&#133;&#148; Tara moaned her love&#146;s name
breathlessly. She paused for a brief moment when she reached Rini&#146;s
skirt. Her hand went under the skirt and the elastic band of Rini&#146;s
panties in a fluid motion. Rini took in a sharp breath of air when she
felt Tara&#146;s fingers brush past her soft, pink hair. The pink haired girl
moaned as Tara&#146;s fingers pressed against her soft skin. Her own finger
pushed deeper into Tara. Tara&#146;s hand stopped as searing pleasure shot
through her body like an electric current.  Her legs bucked as she felt
the other girl touching her so intimately.
	&#147;Tara, don&#146;t stop,&#148; Rini pleaded. Their lips met as their half-
clothed bodies pressed together. Their tongues dueled as they kissed,
both wanting the other to know the extent of their feelings. Tara looked
deeply into her lover&#146;s beautiful crimson eyes. She could feel all the
love and passion that radiated between them as she lost herself in those
eyes.
	A trail of kisses led down Tara&#146;s jaw line as Rini reveled in the
salty taste of the dark haired girl&#146;s skin. A soft moan escaped her lips as
Tara&#146;s fingers found her jewel. The heat between her legs grew
unbearable from the other girl&#146;s loving touch. She kissed down Tara&#146;s
neck, her hand brushing through her soft, dark hair. She continued to
tease and kiss Tara&#146;s glistening, pale skin. The pink haired girl gasped,
her lover&#146;s sweet caresses pushing her over the edge. She never could
describe the sheer ecstasy she felt when she and Tara made love. Her
finger pushed further between Tara&#146;s soft folds as pleasure shot through
her.
	&#147;Rini!&#148; Tara cried, her muscles clenching around Rini&#146;s
probing finger. She arched her back, the incredible feelings rushing
throughout her body. Her eyes clenched shut as she waited for the
sweet sensations to pass, wishing she could somehow stop the all too
brief moment from ending.
	The dark haired girl slumped back on the bed in the mock-up
of a girl named Hotaru&#146;s room. Pink hair obscured her vision from Rini
landing beside her. Tara laughed and brushed some of her lover&#146;s hair
out of the way. She was still breathing hard when she caught a glimpse
of the other actress. Hands folded across her stomach, she was looking
up at where a roof would be had they been in a real room. A smile
swept across Tara&#146;s face as she looked at the girl she loved. Rini looked
over and returned the smile, her eyes lighting up. Tara&#146;s arms went
around her love, her head resting on the other girl&#146;s shoulder. Her hand
rested atop both of Rini&#146;s. She felt the rise and fall of her lover&#146;s chest
as they lay in silence. &#147;What are you thinking about?&#148; Tara asked
quietly.
	Rini paused a moment before answering, as if deep in thought.
&#147;Do you ever stop and wonder if maybe somewhere out there, there&#146;s
another you?&#148;
	Tara laughed and held Rini closer. &#147;As long as she&#146;s with the
other you that&#146;s out there.&#148; She smiled and kissed the other girl softly.
&#147;I&#146;m sure I&#146;d be happy no matter where or when I was as long as I was
with you.&#148;
	Rini grinned and raised an eyebrow. &#147;Even if the other me was
as clumsy or ate as much as my character?&#148; the pink haired actress
asked.
	&#147;Even then,&#148; Tara said, laughing. The two kissed again, longer
this time. Everything around them started to fade away as they lost
themselves in each other.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	ChibiUsa bolted upright in bed. She looked frantically around
the dark bedroom. She felt the sleeping form next to her roll over. She
sighed in relief when she saw Hotaru lying beside her. She could feel
the dark haired girl&#146;s bare skin against her own. She hugged her close.
She felt Hotaru stir before getting comfortable again.
	That had been such a strange dream. But had it really been that
bad? She&#146;d still had Hotaru. The others had still been there, even if 
everything was a little different. Maybe it hadn&#146;t been so bad after all.
	ChibiUsa silently watched Hotaru&#146;s sleeping face. The other
girl looked so peaceful. She&#146;d thought about waking her up, but now
she decided against it. It wasn&#146;t anything to worry about. And she had
everything she could want right there in the sleeping dark haired girl.
They could always talk about it in the morning. In the meantime, she&#146;d
just try and get some sleep. She kissed Hotaru softly on the cheek
before laying her head back on the pillow. ChibiUsa smiled and closed
her eyes as Hotaru snuggled closer in her sleep.
