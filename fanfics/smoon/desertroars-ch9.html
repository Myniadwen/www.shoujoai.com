<h1>And the Desert Roars (part 9 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/arashi.html">arashi-enkou</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/desertroars-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Rei moaned and felt the darkness that had ate at her soul dissapear 
underneath Usagi&#39;s lips. &#39;Oh gods...Usagi&#39;

How long had it been since they&#39;d last kissed?

She wrapped her arms around her princess and held her there, feeling 
Usagi gasp and surrender. This felt so good. So right. But there was a 
funny taste in her mouth. Kind of...metallic? That was weird. She really 
couldn&#39;t remember too much...

&quot;Usagi,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I love you so much...&quot;

&quot;I know Rei,&quot; Usagi replied. Her voice sounded...cold...&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Pain sliced through her body as the cold steel of Minako&#39;s used hunting 
knife slid through her flesh, puncturing her heart. She gasped in pain 
and looked down. Usagi had punctured her own heart with the long blade, 
angiling it to where the blade would go through Rei&#39;s body, and then her 
own.

&quot;Usagi...&quot; she croaked. &quot;Why?&quot;

Usagi sobbed. &quot;The curse says that I have to kill you.&quot; She looked up 
and her blue eyes flashed. &quot;But it doesn&#39;t say that I can&#39;t end mine 
too.&quot;

&quot;So the kiss,&quot; Her strength bled out of her body as she collapsed to the 
sand, Usagi sprawled against her. &quot;It was fake?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Usagi whispered. &quot;That was real. But I...Rei...You wouldn&#39;t have 
stayed you for very long...&quot;

Oh.

So it was to protect the world.

&quot;I do love you Rei,&quot; Usagi whimpered. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be without you 
again.&quot;

The curse says that I have to kill you. But it doesn&#39;t say that I can&#39;t 
end mine too.

&quot;You knew we were both going to die tonight.&quot; The desert child murmured 
as they both laid on the sand, their combined blood turning the golden 
dust a rusty red.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Usagi whispered as darkness began to appear at the edges of her 
vision. &quot;but I have you again.&quot; She reached up and weakly placed a kiss 
on the raven haired girl&#39;s lips. &quot;That&#39;s all that matters.&quot;

And with a sigh, they drifted off into oblivion.

Together. 

:::---:::

&quot;Oh God,&quot; Ami whispered in horror. &quot;What...&quot;

&quot;The curse has been completed.&quot; Haruka said coldy.

Makoto turned and gathered a shaking Ami into her arms. &quot;Why?!&quot; the 
teacher sobbed against her genie&#39;s chest. &quot;They did nothing wrong! They 
were in love! Why Makoto?!&quot; She quieted down and whimpered, &quot;Why?&quot;

Makoto hiccuped and buried her face in Ami&#39;s hair. &quot;I wish we could have 
stopped this.&quot; Ami moaned. &quot;I really wish we had...&quot;

The genie perked up. &quot;Why Mistress,&quot; she began. &quot;Was that a wish?&quot;

Ami looked up, puzzled by her genie&#39;s odd behavior.

&quot;Makoto, what are you talking about?&quot;

Makoto scooped up Ami in her arms, bridal style. &quot;Your wish is granted.&quot; 
And with a swirl of emerald green magic, they dissapeared.

Haruka furrowed her brows in confusion. &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re gonna change Papa.&quot;

Michiru turned to see a stoic Hotaru, gazing sadly at Rei and Usagi. 
&#39;They Princess and The Warrior are gonna be free.&quot; the child murmured. A 
harsh sob brought their attention to Setsuna and Minako. 

:::---:::

&quot;Please don&#39;t go,&quot; Setsuna whimpered against her hair. &quot;Don&#39;t leave me 
all alone again.&quot; Pain racked the blonde&#39;s body as she struggled to stay 
awake. Setsuna began to rock back and forth, cradiling Minako&#39;s body to 
her own.

&quot;I love you.&quot;

Setsun gasped and looked down at the girl. &quot;W-what?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think I ever said that before. But I do.&quot; Dim blue eyes locked 
with garnet. &quot;I love you.&quot;

&quot;Say it again,&quot; the sorceress pleaded against wheat-colored locks. &quot;Say 
it once more, for me?&quot;

&quot;I love you Setsuna.&quot;

Three little words exploded from her heart, and Setsuna whispered, &quot;I 
love you too Minako.&quot;

Hotaru crouched down and gazed at Minako&#39;s wound. A strange light 
entered the child&#39;s eyes as she lifted a hand and hovered it over 
Minako&#39;s wound.

&quot;With Death,&quot; she murmured. &quot;Comes Rebirth.&quot;

A purple light flowed from Hotaru&#39;s hand to the blonde&#39;s chest, sealing 
up the wound until there was a hole in the clothing that showed milky 
white skin.

&quot;The cylcle continues,&quot; the child whispered. &quot;A death this night, shall 
give another the chance of rebirth.&quot; Hotaru closed her eyes and 
collapsed onto the sand.

&quot;Hotaru!&quot; Michiru gasped, breaking out of Haruka&#39;s arms and rushing to 
Hotaru&#39;s side. &quot;Hotaru!&quot; Violet eyes blinked open and Hotaru let out a 
big yawn.

&quot;I hope they save them,&quot; she slurred as sleep gently enfolded the girl 
in its grasp. &quot;I really hope they do.&quot;

Haruka knelt by her love&#39;s side. &quot;Who will save who?&quot;

Setsuna swallowed thickly. &quot;I think,&quot; she whisperd. &quot;I think she meant 
Rei and Usagi...&quot;
