<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A/N: All  right kiddies, did you enjoy the last chapter? Good, because after this  it’s going to get ANGSTY! (Or, as angsty as Shiki will let me. Damn  muse.) And do you remember that twist I was talking about? –Evil grin-</span></p>

:: Truth and Lies ::
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t get it.” Sailor Jupiter growled. “Why did Takeda take out a  contract on his own daughter? I know he wants the Jinja—but why? What’s  so important there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well if I knew <em>that</em> we wouldn’t be  driving off to see him now would we?” Katai sneered sarcastically from  his position in the driver’s seat. Jupiter looked across from him, as  she had ‘shotgun’, and glared at the assassin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Children please.” Sailor Mercury sighed. Both Katai and Jupiter shared a look that said, “We’ll finish this later.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  know where he lives?” Sailor Mercury asked, trying to keep her  companion’s attention off of killing each other and onto finding Takeda.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,”  Katai grunted. “Not yet. Guy didn’t give me an address.” He chuckled to  himself dryly. Sailor Jupiter heaved an exasperated sigh. “Then where  the hell are we going!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Takeda looked like he spends hours in  his office.” The assassin explained. “So, we’re going to the senator’s  office. If he’s not there, I’ve got a couple of reliable sources we can  use.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The car was filled with a tense, yet not uncomfortable  silence. The air was charged, in a way. Perhaps it was Jupiter and  Katai’s unanimous hatred of Rei’s father. Mercury bit her lip as she  remembered the breakdown she had not too long ago; a few moths before  Takeda Hino even came to the shrine.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She had received a call from her father.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Actually, she had received two calls from her father.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The first was a blessing. A reunion that had been put off too long. The second was…less than perfect.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  fact, it had left her broken and weeping in the safety and comfort of  Makoto’s arms. And Rei, Haruka, Makoto, and—shockingly—Minako had  threatened to castrate him afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay girls,” Katai’s  slightly smug voice broke her train of thoughts. “We’re here.” Mercury  blinked and looked out the window. Jupiter let out a triumphant laugh,  and scrambled out the car. Mercury shook her head and exited the  vehicle, slower. She looked at the building…and up…and up…soon she was  craning her neck just to see the top. If she leaned back anymore she  was sure she would topple over. The structure was the same as the  government official who ran it; tall, cold, intimidating.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,”  Katai chuckled. “The insurance on this baby must be in the millions;  surprised no one’s burned it down yet.” Sailor Mercury found herself  agreeing a bit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably because it’d be too big. It would take  the whole night get the first five floors on fire.” Sailor Jupiter  noted. Mercury looked at her partner with just a hint of worry. How did  she know that?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Enough chit-chat,” Katai barked. “We need to get  a move on.” The two Senshi nodded. They left it to Mercury and her  super computer to undo the security systems, (after all, the Senshi of  Ice certainly didn’t want Jupiter to blow a hole in this particular  building like she did when they found out Usagi was the Moon Princess),  and to find out what floor the senator’s office was on. Soon, the trio  found themselves on the elevator, climbing up to the forty-second  floor. A repetitive tune flowed from the speakers, in an attempt to  produce a calming effect to counteract the claustrophobia that the  small box produced.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To be truthful, it was more annoying than soothing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even worse was when Katai began to hum along.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sailor  Mercury heard a thump and saw that Sailor Jupiter was beginning to  slowly bang her head against the wall with forty-five second  interludes. She grimaced and patted her girlfriend’s hand. When the  blessed ding came, signaling that they had arrived to their  destination, Mercury had to actually reel in the desire to kiss the  floor and weep in gratitude.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Oh yeah. She was spending way too much time with Minako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Wasn’t Setsuna supposed to rub off on her blonde haired idol-in-training?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Katai  reached behind him and produced a small, yet deadly pistol, no doubt  from the waistband of his jeans. Preparing a short, but harsh lecture  about gun safety, she saw the man flick the safety control off. He  motioned to the door and resembled an army official for a brief second.  Taking his lead, Sailor Jupiter approached an oak-door and twisted a  brass knob. The lock that had been there broke easily under her  strength. There was a shuffle within, a tell-tale sign that someone had  noticed the lock breaking and was very aware.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Jupiter cast a look  at Mercury. The blue haired girl blinked, then nodded with a sigh.  Grinning, Jupiter lifted her leg and slammed it into the wooden door.  It toppled down, just as Katai’s had done. Said assassin stayed back  while the two Senshi strode within the room, Mercury firing up her lie  detector program while Jupiter cracked her knuckles threateningly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Katai noted that they would make the ultimate interrogation team.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  are doing here!?” Takeda snarled, jumping from his position from behind  his desk. Sailor Jupiter slammed her fists into the mahogany piece of  furniture, not noticing the wood creak under the pressure. The raven  haired man backed away, fear shining in his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The real question is,” Jupiter began in a deadly hiss, “Why did you take out a contract on your own daughter!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What!?” the senator gasped. “How dare you!? I did no such thing!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mercury’s eyes widened as she read the results. “Jupiter, he’s telling—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You liar</em>!”  Jupiter roared. She threw the desk aside so that the man, who was now  shaking a bit, had no barrier. “You paid Katai Hitogoroshi to kill Rei  Hino. Why!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Jupiter,” Sailor Mercury gulped. “Listen! He’s—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  man is not Takeda Hino.” Katai growled. Sailor Jupiter looked at the  assassin, then back at Takeda. That was impossible! He looked exactly  like the man who had approached Rei at the Jinja!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Who’s telling the truth</em>!?”  the brunette Senshi screamed at Mercury. The blue haired girl looked at  her computer, then slowly looked at the confused and enraged Jupiter.  Then, she gave her answer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They <em>both</em> are.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
His  face remained expressionless, yet inside, he was boiling. From his  position within the trees, he saw his daughter, his heir, laughing with  that disgusting moon child.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Her</em>. The daughter of Serenity; the  bitch who had taken his precious Diana away from him. Just so the next  ruler of Mars, who was no doubt stronger than any of the twits on their  team, could play baby-sitter to a whining, crybaby.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He had thought when he’d hired the fool of an assassin to shoot this <em>Rei Hino</em>, the shock would reveal her true self. His precious Diana.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Soon. Soon he would get his daughter back. He would burn anyone who got in his way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After all: he was a Martian king. And Mars needed its princess once more.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
A/N:  HA!! I bet you didn’t see that comin! OH!! YALL GOT SERVED!!! See!?  What’d I tell you!? I bet your jaw’s hittin the floor by now huh!? HUH!?
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Robot Chicken Guy: What a tweest!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Huzzah! We have a plot now! And a villain!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I enjoy writing Katai; regardless of the fact that I’ve never written Male dialogue outside of Cloud Strife and the SM boyz.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I feel so proud of myself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Oh,  and for making Past!Rei’s name Diana, that is not mine. I thought it  made a fitting name after reading ‘Her Battle’. You cannot read that  fic and Kirika’s Absence and call yourself a true ReixUsagi fan. I  myself have read both. 8D So, I can call myself a true RxU fan. Yay me!</span></p>
