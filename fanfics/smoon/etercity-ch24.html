The first flakes of snow began to fall, gleaming as they fell down
between the crystal towers of the Palace. A hand reached out, a
flake landing on pink skin only to melt a moment later. From behind
her a amused voice commented, &quot;You know, there are people in the
city who don&#39;t understand why we don&#39;t use weather control
technology to stop Christmas snow.&quot;

Queen Serenity turned with a gentle smile, blue eyes warm as she
walked over to her husband, &quot;It wouldn&#39;t feel right without snow.&quot;
She moved forward to slip into his arms, her long white-blonde hair
falling in twin streams down her back.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Endymion agreed, his purple-black hair falling down into his
eyes. The violet suit he wore fit his thin form, much like the white
dress she was in. They moved together through the comfortable set of
rooms as he quietly said, &quot;I&#39;m glad so many of the Senshi are on
Earth this year, it&#39;s almost like old times.&quot;

&quot;Even Ran has come back,&quot; Serenity added before frowning
slightly, &quot;though I understand she still isn&#39;t getting along with
her mothers.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s too much like the two of them,&quot; he offered, &quot;that&#39;s why they
clash.&quot;

Serenity smiled impishly as she raised a delicate eyebrow, &quot;So why
doesn&#39;t Erica have that problem? She&#39;s certainly the spitting image
of Haruka.&quot;

&quot;Good question,&quot; Endymion conceded, &quot;maybe you can ask tonight at
the party.&quot;

In another part of the Palace and later on that day Arisugawa Juri
adjusted the dress she was wearing, the long red dress hugging her
slim form. &quot;I&#39;m still not sure this goes with my hair,&quot; she
admitted, reaching up to adjust orange curls.

&quot;You look lovely,&quot; Setsuna Meiou answered, moving to put her hand on
Juri&#39;s arm. Her long black hair glistened green in the light, her
short black dress highlighting lovely legs.

Juri chuckled softly, &quot;You&#39;d probably say that if I was wearing a
sack.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Setsuna sighed, laying her head on Juri&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;So, is there anything that I need to watch out for tonight?&quot; Juri
asked her curiously as they moved over to the door.

Setsuna led the way out into the hallway, &quot;Well, Erica is dating a
young lady named Caterine, apparently, and you&#39;ve already heard
about Ran&#39;s return.&quot;

Juri made a face at that as she wryly asked her, &quot;So who gets to
keep themselves between Ran and Hotaru tonight?&quot;

Setsuna looked amused, &quot;I understand we&#39;ll be taking turns.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s assuming Ran even decides to attend the party,&quot; Juri
commented as they walked into the lift together, reaching out she
quickly keyed in the proper level and they were off..

Setsuna sighed, &quot;That would really disappoint her parents.&quot;

&quot;Ran&#39;s made a habit of doing that,&quot; Juri remarked. She lift gently
came to a stop as she said, &quot;I&#39;m glad the Queen isn&#39;t inviting too
many people this year.&quot;

&quot;An intimate party rather than a mob,&quot; Setsuna laughed. She looked
up at Juri curiously, &quot;When are we sneaking away to drop in to the
Locket?&quot;

&quot;Before midnight, anyway,&quot; Juri said with a chuckle. Setsuna knew
her very well, understandable considering how long they had been
together. &quot;Maybe I can even congratulate May and Ruri,&quot; she added as
they strode down the hall.

&quot;I&#39;m glad to hear that Ruri&#39;s making progress,&quot; Setsuna commented as
they reached the doors to the meeting hall.

&quot;Ruri&#39;s very patient,&quot; Juri smiled slightly as she nodded to the
guard getting the door, &quot;which is good because May is remarkably
skittish.&quot;

&quot;Yo, Juri,&quot; Urd waved from where she stood by her lover Priss
Asagiri.

Sylia Stingray smirked, her silvery hair held back by clips as her
tawny lover Mara joked, &quot;She has no decorum at all.&quot;

Urd turned to glare at Mara, &quot;Like you&#39;re so well mannered.&quot;

&quot;And there they go again,&quot; Linna chuckled softly, exchanging a warm
glance with her lover Belldandy.

Ran watched as more guests entered the hall and sipped at her cup of
eggnog, standing there by Erica, Usagi and Hotaru. Around them
friends of the Senshi were gathered, the Knight Sabers, Sakura and
Tomoyo, the Goddesses and many other guests. To everyone&#39;s surprise
the Starlights had even agreed to come.

The blue haired young woman turned back to Erica then Ran asked, &quot;I
thought you were bringing your friend?&quot;

Erica shook her head, black hair falling into her eyes as she said
regretfully, &quot;She has a family thing to go to.&quot;

&quot;Too bad,&quot; Ran flashed a grin as she adjusted her short black
dress, &quot;I wanted to see if she was good enough for you.&quot;

&quot;I like her,&quot; Usagi volunteered, her long pink hair flowing over the
white dress she wore, &quot;even if she&#39;s still in awe of all this.&quot;

Hotaru looked over at Ran thoughtfully as the older woman
commented, &quot;I was almost expecting you to come in uniform.&quot;

Ran didn&#39;t take the bait, instead she flashed a smile, &quot;I think I
caused enough of a stir wearing it when I first arrived.&quot;

&quot;Too bad,&quot; the gentle voice said from behind her, &quot;I would have
liked to see it.&quot;

Ran turned, about to make a flippant comment when she saw who it
was. Her mouth dropped open as she looked at Queen Serenity then
swiftly mastered her surprise. &quot;My Queen,&quot; she reflexedly brought
her hand to her chest in a Khanite salute, half bowing.

&quot;It&#39;s not necessary,&quot; Serenity said even though she seemed mildly
charmed by Ran&#39;s gesture, &quot;as I understand you renounced your
citizenship in Crystal Tokyo.&quot;

Ran didn&#39;t make excuses, ignoring the gasps of surprise from her
friends as she met Serenity&#39;s eyes, &quot;It seemed the thing to do at
the time.&quot;

&quot;Either way,&quot; the taller woman gently drew Ran into a hug as
Serenity said, &quot;it&#39;s good to have you home again, Ran.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Ran whispered back, the two parting before Serenity
moved off to greet some of the other guests.

&quot;You renounced your citizenship?&quot; Usagi sounded disbelieving.

&quot;It was a requirement for joining the Khanite military,&quot; Ran
answered them crisply, &quot;and I was pretty certain I could reapply if
I needed to.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re parents are going to have a fit when they find out,&quot; Hotaru
groaned bafore adding, &quot;assuming they don&#39;t know already.&quot;

In another corner of the room Makoto Kino chuckled softly as the
amazonian brown haired senshi commented, &quot;She really fainted on you?&quot;

Taiki nodded, her redish brown hair tied back in it&#39;s normally
severe style. &quot;Oh yes,&quot; she agreed, &quot;if I knew we were going to be
this popular again, I don&#39;t know if I would have agreed to start
preforming again.&quot;

Makoto admitted shyly, &quot;I went to one of your shows a few weeks ago,
the Three Lights haven&#39;t lost their touch.&quot;

Taiki actually blushed, the slightly taller woman looking bashful
and cute. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she answered. She looked at Makoto
curiously, &quot;I was wondering... do you still cook?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Makoto wondered where this was going, &quot;though not as often as
I&#39;d like to.&quot;

&quot;Sadly none of we three do,&quot; Taiki admitted a bit sheepishly, &quot;and
I&#39;m getting very tired of eating out in resturants all the time.&quot;

Makoto felt herself smiling slightly as she asked, &quot;You&#39;d like me to
come over and cook something for you?&quot;

&quot;More like teach me,&quot; Taiki said, still blushing.

&quot;I seem to remember you were a good student,&quot; Makoto mused, &quot;I
suppose we could try.&quot;

&quot;Hey, Taiki,&quot; Yaten called, the slim white haire girl waving her arm.

&quot;Thank you very much, Makoto,&quot; Taiki said greatfully as she moved to
join the others, &quot;it looks like we&#39;re on.&quot;

The Three lights took the stage, Seiya taking the lead as they
played. The Christmas songs were warm, flowing like honey over the
appreciative audience. Dressed in suits and wearing their trademark
colored roses they were a striking group, even with their feminine
genders revealed.

&quot;I can see why the girl&#39;s are all fainting over them,&quot; a clearly
enchanted Makoto had to admit as she watched them preform.

&quot;Peace on Earth, can it be?&quot; Seiya sang, &quot;Some years from now,
perhapse we&#39;ll see,&quot;

&quot;See the days of glory,&quot; Yaten sang out, her voice like a
bell, &quot;Where men of good will live in peace, live in peace again.&quot;

&quot;Peace on Earth, can it be?&quot; Taiki finished up.

Together, all three raised there voices as one, &quot;Every child must be
made aware, every child must be made to care, to care enough for her
fellow man and give all the love that they can....&quot;

Serenity sighed happily as she rested her head on her husband&#39;s
shoulder, both of them enjoying the singing. &quot;Have you decided what
to do about them?&quot; Endymion asked quietly.

&quot;I&#39;d like to apologize to Seiya,&quot; Serenity answered honestly, &quot;I&#39;ve
always felt bad about how I treated her back then.&quot;</pre>
