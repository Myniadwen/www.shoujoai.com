<h1>Mi Domando Se Li Vedro Ancora (part 9 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/domando-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>The song is called &#39;If you could read my mind&#39; and is sung by Gordon 
Lightfoot. I don&#39;t own the song nor SM.

Makoto yawned and stretched. She rolled onto her side and wrapped her 
arm around Minako. Only she wasn&#39;t there. Makoto shot up, wide awake.

&quot;Mina-chan?&quot;

Minako walked thru the bedroom door and smiled kindly at Makoto. &quot;Just 
wake up?&quot; Makoto nodded. minako walked over to the desk and picked up 
the note she had left for Makoto and showed it to her. &quot;I learned my 
lesson.&quot;

&quot;Obviously not, or you&#39;d have woken me up.&quot; Makoto relaxed and laid back 
down.

Minako continued to smile at Makoto as she stripped from her clothes 
down to her bra and panties before crawling under the blankets with 
Makoto. &quot;it wasn&#39;t a battle, love. Or I would have.&quot; She wrapped her 
arms around Makoto&#39;s shoulders and pulled her down so Makoto&#39;s head was 
on her chest. Minako ran her fingers thru Makoto&#39;s brown hair gently. 
&quot;How are you feeling?&quot;

Makoto sighed. &quot;Headache-y.&quot;

Minako gently kissed Makoto&#39;s head. &quot;Hopefully we&#39;ll be able to take 
care of it soon. I went to see Rei so she could do a fire reading.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;I have a feeling your headaches are something docters won&#39;t be able to 
find.&quot;

&quot;Spirtual?&quot;

Minako nodded. &quot;Hai.&quot; Minako continued to pet Makoto&#39;s hair. &quot;What are 
your plans for today, love?&quot;

&quot;Taking Chibi Usa out to see a movie. Yung Hu and the other guardians 
have a meeting and he asked me to take her.&quot; Makoto adjusted her head on 
Minako&#39;s shoulder so she could snuggle closer to the girl.

&quot;Why won&#39;t Usagi take her? She is the child&#39;s mother.&quot;

Makoto smiled sleepily. &quot;Hai, that&#39;s true. But since Mamoru-san got his 
memory back, she&#39;s been spending time with him. So it&#39;s no big deal. 
You&#39;re more than welcome to come along with us.&quot;

Minako shook her head. &quot;I can&#39;t. i have some stuff to do. I&#39;ll just have 
to meet up with you two later.&quot;

Makoto nodded, yawned and let her eyes drop closed.

If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
&#39;Bout a ghost from a wishin&#39; well

In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free
As long as I&#39;m a ghost that you can&#39;t see

&quot;&#39;Mr. Bubbles, aliens are attacking my house!&#39;&quot; Chibi Usa cried out 
happily.

Makoto laughed and replied, &quot;&#39;Never mind, my puppy found the chainsaw!&#39;&quot;

Chibi Usa and Makoto laughed as they exited the movie, reciting their 
favorite lines.

&quot;That was a great movie, Mako-chan! Thanks for taking me to see it.&quot;

Makoto smiled at the child and took her hand. &quot;No prob, little one. I 
enjoyed it. Best one Disney has done in a long while.&quot;

Chibi Usa nodded as she looked across the street. &quot;Mako-chan, isn&#39;t that 
Ami-chan headed over here?&quot;

Makoto couldn&#39;t help but groan as she watched Ami cross the street over 
to them...

Minako stretched as she walked out of the bank. She hated being couped 
up indoors on such a nice day, even if it was chilly.

She walked down the street and turned the corner. As she turned, she 
looked across the street on a whim and saw Makoto and Chibi Usa standing 
in front of the local theatre. She seemed to be waiting for something. 
Minako shrugged, smiled and was about to call out Makoto&#39;s name when she 
saw a blue haired girl run up to Makoto, wrap her arms around the 
amazon&#39;s neck and press her lips to hers...

If I could read your mind love
What a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel
The kind that drugstores sell

When you reach the part where the heartaches come
The hero would be me
But heroes often fail
And you won&#39;t read that book again
Because the ending&#39;s just too hard to take

Makoto growled as she and Chibi Usa entered her apartment. When Chibi 
Usa was out of the way, Makoto slammed the door shut so hard a picture 
that was next tot he door fell to the ground. Chibi Usa quickly walked 
over to the couch to sit down.

&quot;That BITCH!&quot; Makoto roared. &quot;Wait until Minako finds out...&quot;

&quot;SHould you really tell her, Mako-chan,&quot; Chibi Usa asked timidly.

Makoto looked at the child, sighed and slumped into the nearby chair. &quot;I 
honestly don&#39;t know...&quot; Makoto turned to look at Chibi Usa and smiled a 
bit. &quot;Goes with out saying that I&#39;m angry, but not at you so don&#39;t act 
so scared, ok?&quot;

Chibi Usa&#39;s face imediatly lit up. &quot;Ok!&quot; She slid into the floor, ran 
and jumped up into Makoto&#39;s lap. &quot;So, why did Ami kiss you anyway?&quot;

&quot;Long story,&quot; Makoto groaned. &quot;Basically, we dated, broke up, and I got 
with Mina-chan. And now she isnt happy about it.&quot;

Chibi Usa nodded. &quot;..Maybe you should tell Minako.&quot;

Makoto chuckled. &quot;I feel like I&#39;m talking to someone my own age, not a 
six year old.&quot;

Chibi Usa smiled a smile that reminded Makoto of Princess Serenity when 
she was trying to be serious yet gentle at the same time. The child&#39;s 
eyes held so much maturity and wisdom, Makoto couldn&#39;t help but to be 
drawn into them.

Ruffleing Chibi Usa&#39;s hair, Makoto smiled. &quot;You look so much like your 
mother, you know that?&quot;

Chibi Usa&#39;s smile grew. &quot;I get that alot.&quot;

&quot;Honey, I&#39;m home!&quot;

Chibi Usa and Makoto turned to the balconey to see Yung Hu, in his 
gargoyle form, step through the sliding glass doors and shift to his 
human form.

&quot;HU-CHAN!&quot; Chibi Usa jumped from Makoto&#39;s lap and ran to Yung Hu and 
hugged his legs. &quot;My Hu-chan!&quot;

Makoto couldn&#39;t help but to laugh as Yung Hu picked Chibi Usa up, threw 
her in the air slightly and caught her then hugged her close. Chibi Usa 
wrapped her tiny arms tightly around Yung Hu&#39;s neck and held on tightly 
as he walked over to the couch to sit down with her still inhis arms.

&quot;How was the meeting,&quot; Makoto asked.

&quot;Informational,&quot; he said. &quot;Minako showed up just as I was leaving..&quot;

Makoto looked at him. Picking up Rei for a shopping trip prolly. Girl is 
gonna make me go broke. I regret the day I gave her acess to my credit 
card.&quot; Makoto laughed, but stopped when Yung Hu hadn&#39;t joined in. &quot;Whats 
wrong?&quot;

&quot;She did indeed go to see Rei, but not for any shopping trip. She was in 
tears.&quot;

Makoto shot up and looked at Yung Hu. &quot;What was wrong with her!?&quot;

&quot;She saw you and Ami kiss today,&quot; he said solemly.

&quot;WHAT?! That lil&#39; bitch fucking kissed me! I did NOT kiss her back!&quot; 
Makoto was now standing from her chiar, her face red and her body 
shaking from rage.

&quot;Calm down, Mako-chan,&quot; Yung Hu said. &quot;I&#39;m not blaming you. I believe 
you when you say you didn&#39;t kiss her. Minako, however, doesn&#39;t. She&#39;s 
the one you need to convince, not me.&quot;

Makoto stood there, glaring at Yung Hu, but not seeing him. Her eyes 
were filled with such a hatred that she felt that she was going to 
explode.

&quot;Maybe if I told Minako-chan what really happened,&quot; Chibi Usa finally 
pipped in. &quot;I was there. I saw Makoto push her away and yell at her.&quot;

Yung Hu shook his head. &quot;Iie, its best you stayed out of it.&quot;

&quot;Demo-&quot;

&quot;Promise me, Usa-chan,&quot; Yung Hu said sternly. Sighing, the child nodded 
her head.

&quot;I&#39;m going to talk to Minako,&quot; Makoto said before storming out of her 
apartment and slamming the door behind her.

Yung Hu sighed, his eyes filled with sadness. &quot;So it begins...&quot;

I&#39;d walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three way script
Enter number two
A movie queen to play the scene
Of bringing all the good things out in me

But for now love, let&#39;s be real
I never thought I could act this way
And I&#39;ve got to say that I just don&#39;t get it
I don&#39;t know where we went wrong
But the feelin&#39;s gone
And I just can&#39;t get it back

Makoto sighed as she tossed and turned. She just couldn&#39;t sleep. After 
she had stormed out of her apartment, she got into her car and drove to 
Rei&#39;s temple. However, Rei had greeted her at the stairs...

i&quot;I&#39;m going to kill that little bitch,&quot; Makoto said to herself as she 
climbed the stairs to Rei&#39;s temple. She ran up them three at a time and 
was quite winded by the time she reached the top.

Makoto ran to the building where Rei&#39;s bedroom was and as she neared it, 
she saw Rei step out of the shadows of the door and stand there.

&quot;Rei-chan,&quot; Makoto said, hunching over, gulping in air. &quot;Is Minako 
here?&quot;

&quot;She is, Mako-chan. But she doesn&#39;t want to see you.&quot; Rei&#39;s voice seemed 
to hold panic.

&quot;I&#39;ve got to talk to her, Rei-chan! She needs to understand what 
happened!&quot; Makoto was frantic. &quot;I didn&#39;t kiss Ami, I would NEVER do that 
Minako!&quot;

&quot;I know that,&quot; Rei said sadly. &quot;But Minako is hurting. Leave her alone 
for now, please?&quot;

&quot;Rei-chan-&quot;

&quot;Leave, Mako-chan. Please don&#39;t force me to make you go.&quot;/i

She didn&#39;t believe me, Makoto thought, I could see it in her eyes. 
Makoto sighed and turned over yet again to look at her clock. It was 
near one in the morning. Although tired, Makoto was unable to sleep 
without Minako beside her.

As Makoto closed her eyes, her phone ringing jolted her awake once more. 
Jumping up and running to the phone, Makoto prayed it was Minako.

&quot;Moshi moshi??&quot;

&quot;Makoto-san, its Usagi,&quot; came a soft reply that seemed strained.

&quot;Usa-chan? Why are you calling me so late?&quot;

&quot;Is Chibi Usa there,&quot; came Usagi&#39;s frantic response. &quot;She&#39;s not here and 
I don&#39;t know where else she could be.&quot; Usagi sounded close to tears.

&quot;Uh-&quot;

&quot;Who is it,&quot; Yung Hu asked yawning.

&quot;Is Chibi Usa in the bedroom with you,&quot; Makoto asked the feline. He 
looked at her confused and shook his head.

&quot;I took her home when you left for the temple, you know that. Why?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s missing,&quot; Makoto replied, then turned her attention back to the 
phone. &quot;I&#39;ll go and look for her, alright, Usagi?&quot; Yung Hu nodded his 
head, and Makoto added, &quot;Yung Hu said he would too.&quot;

Usagi&#39;s voice cracked as she answered, &quot;Thanks you guys.&quot; As Makoto 
began to hang up, she heard a beeping noise and Usagi told her to stay 
on the line. As Makoto agreed, she heard a beeping noise from her 
bedroom and nodded for Yung Hu to run and get it. HE did and brought 
back to her, but he was now in his gargoyle form. Clicking it on, it was 
Sailor Mars on the small screen.

&quot;Youma attack,&quot; she said. &quot;Its near the temple. Hurry guys!&quot; The screen 
went blank and Makoto hung the phone up.

&quot;Lets go Yung Hu,&quot; she comanded, turning to her balconey and jumping 
from it. In midair, Makoto yelled out her transformation and was Sailor 
Jupiter by the time she hit the ground. Above her Yung Hu was gliding 
towards the temple.

If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
&#39;Bout a ghost from a wishin&#39; well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet

Jupiter turned to run down the street where Rei&#39;s temple was. As she 
turned the cornor, she saw Yung Hu and the other gargoyle guardians 
already fighting Rubeus, and not fairing very well.

&quot;Sparkling Wide Pressure!&quot; Jupiter called out, blasting the red haired 
man. He didn&#39;t even falter.

Turning, he glared at her. Thats when Jupiter noticed a small rod tucked 
away in belt, glowing with an evil purple light.

&quot;Mars Fire Ignite!&quot;

&quot;Venus Love Me Chain!&quot;

A ball of fire and orange energy shot forward and also hit Rubeus. Again 
it did nothing.

&quot;Stop doing that!&quot; Yelled a voice. &quot;That scepter of his is absorbing our 
powers!&quot;

Rubeus smirked evilly. &quot;Very good Mercury, but a little too late.&quot; The 
scepter&#39;s globe all the energy back towrds the nine warriors and they 
all shot backward into the walls that surround the temple.

Groaning, Jupiter stood shakily to her feet and turned to see how the 
others were doing. They all seemed alright, just beaten bruised. Turning 
back to their foe, Jupiter decided she needed to get rid of the scepter 
and fast if they planned on winning.

&quot;I want the child,&quot; Rubeus said. &quot;Her and the Silver Crystal. Give them 
to me and I&#39;ll let you die quickly instead of slowly.&quot;

&quot;Get bent, carrot top,&quot; Mars said.

Smirking, Rubeus shrugged. &quot;If you insist.&quot; A large beam of silver light 
shot down onto the wariors, causing them all to fall back to the ground.

&quot;Its an anti-gravity beam,&quot; Mercury cried out. &quot;We&#39;re going to be 
crushed if we dont get out of here.&quot;

&quot;No shit Sherlock!&quot; Jupiter said angerily.

&quot;Leave my friends alone!&quot; Sailor Moon had finally showed up along with 
Tuxedo Kamen.

&quot;Or you&#39;ll what,&quot; Rubeus asked. He made the beam come down harder, 
causing the cement beneath the senshi and the gaurdians crack beneath 
their weight.

&quot;Leave them alone!&quot; Chibi Usa had also showed up and was standing on the 
wall surrounding the temple. &quot;Leave them alone or Sailor Moon will beat 
you!&quot;

&quot;Ha!&quot; Rubeus pointed his scepter towards the child. It crackled with 
black lightening and glowed with a purple light.

Yung Hu, using all his strength pulled himself up from his spot andout 
of the beam and ran towards Rubeus, jumped and grappled him around the 
waist, causing the scepter&#39;s attack miss Chibi Usa by several feet.

&quot;Stupid animal,&quot; Rubeus yelled angerily. Yung Hu was thrown off of 
Rubeus and laid on the gorund, panting, his energy spent. &quot;Very well 
then.&quot;

Glaring at Sailor Moon and Chibi Usa he said, &quot;I&#39;ll give you one hour to 
decide about what you will do, Moon Brat. One hour to decide whats more 
precious to you. Your friends, or the child. I&#39;ll return when you have 
decided.&quot; He then vanished, taking all the remaing warriors who were 
still trapped inside the beam with him.

Sailor Moon, Tuxedo Kamen, Chibi Usa, and Yung Hu watched as Rubeus&#39;s 
space craft left the sky and headed for space.

But stories always end
And if you read between the lines
You&#39;ll know that I&#39;m just tryin&#39; to understand
The feelin&#39;s that you lack

I never thought I could feel this way
And I&#39;ve got to say that I just to get it
I don&#39;t know where we went wrong
But the feelin&#39;s gone
And I just can&#39;t get it back</pre>
