<h1>Makoto's Angel (part 3 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jwelch.html">Jessica Welch</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/makang-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Makoto had slept like the dead that night. She felt great, completely
rested, ready to take on the world. This morning she found a note from
Minako hoping that she slept well and had sweet dreams. She had let
herself out and would meet her before school in their usual spot with
Usagi and Ami. She put a little heart at the end like she always did
when she wrote notes. Makoto found it endearing.

She decided to stop moping around dwelling in herself pity. It was
dangerous to do that. Although she enjoyed the massage last night she
didn&#39;t believe she could go through that again. She would just have to
enjoy what moments she could have with Minako... look on the bright
side of things. &#39;The glass is half full, just keep telling yourself
that.&#39; She decided she would go out of her way to make Mina happy. At
least she would feel like she was doing something. Also seeing Mina
laugh or smile at something she had done for her would make herself
feel better. She would just have to find a way to be subtle about it as
to not raise suspicion.

There was another reason to do this also. Just a sliver of hope, if it
had been real. She thought back to yesterday and the time when she was
just falling to sleep. &#39;Those light kisses might not have been a dream.
Maybe Mina-chan does care for me in some special way. It may not be the
same way I feel about her, but its special never the less. If I can
just sorta hint at her, not like court her, but just... make her
think.. maybe things won&#39;t be as hopeless as I once thought. And if it
doesn&#39;t work out that way, no one will be the wiser about my feelings.
She is my friend first and foremost, and I don&#39;t want to do anything to
screw that up&#39;

Her course of action set she took one last look in the mirror. Seeing
that she was ready and everything was in place she grabbed her books
and headed to school. The old Makoto was back and she had a plan that
would sweep Minako off her feet. She just hoped she could go through
with it once she was face to face with her angel.

Makoto was already there when Usagi, Ami, and Minako arrived. Both
Usagi and Ami were surprised but Minako knew their friend would be
feeling better today. &quot;How are you feeling today Mako-chan?&quot; Ami asked.

&quot;Oh much better thanks to Mina-chan. She did a great job of helping me
recover.&quot; Makoto turns and looked at Minako, &quot;Thank you for everything.
I&#39;ll make it up to you,&quot; she said softly.

Before Minako could protest Usagi blurted.&quot; Well you sure do look a lot
better than yesterday. We thought you got hit by a truck the way you
were acting. What was up with that anyway?&quot;

&quot;Well thank you for the compliment Usagi, I know I can always count on
you to tell me when I look like crap,&quot; she said shaking her head. She
knew they would ask this and she had come up with a pretty good
explanation. &quot;You know that boy I mentioned the other day,&quot; she waited
and everyone nodded. &quot;Well after Mina-chan and I went our separate ways
from the park I saw him again. I was on my way home and there he was
across the street in another girl&#39;s arms. I guess it just hit me kinda
hard,&quot; she looked at Minako, &quot;I realized that I could probably never be
with him, or any of the other boys I like. I would have to love from
afar.&quot; Makoto was grinning inwardly. &#39;Oh yeah, nice and subtle, that
can be read into or taken at face value.&#39;

Usagi wailed, &quot;That was so beautiful and romantically tragic.&quot; Tears
were streaming down her face. Ami nodded in agreement and tried to
console the emotional Usagi.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Minako said smiling up at her, &quot;I know there&#39;s someone
out there, someone who loves you very much. They just have to find
you.&quot;

Makoto smiled back. She longed to say she had already found the person
she -loved. &quot;I know, besides I&#39;m better now. I have great friends to
depend on. And when you have friends as wonderful as you, who needs
boys?&quot;

&quot;WHO NEEDS BOYS!?!&quot; Usagi had promptly stopped crying and was staring
in shock. &quot;I mean I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without you guys for
friends, But I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without boys either! You sure
you&#39;re feeling alright Mako-chan?&quot;

&#39;Oops, maybe I took that one a little too far.&#39; &quot;Well I just think I
need a break from them is all, the emotional stress and such.&quot; Makoto&#39;s
eyes narrowed a bit, &quot;But I know why you&#39;re so concerned Usagi-chan.
You want me to have another breakdown like that so you can scarf all my
food!&quot;

Usagi blushed, &quot;Heh heh heh heh heh, no no no.&quot; She tried to hide
behind Ami. &quot;That&#39;s not it. Anyway,&quot; she twittered, &quot;it was lucky I was
there so nothing went to waste.&quot; Makoto pinned her with a glare. &quot;But
you know I would never want to see you in that type of condition
again.&quot; Just then the bell rang and Usagi actually sprinted to class.
The rest of them stood there laughing for a moment before following
their princess to class.

The day went by quickly for everyone. It was a Friday and the sun was
out. Even the teachers were distracted and took it easy for once.
Makoto seemed to be back to her old self. &#39;Well maybe not her old self,
there is something new about the way she&#39;s doing things, like she&#39;s on
a quest or something. I&#39;ll ask her about it later.&#39; Minako thought in
one of her classes. Lunch was the same as usual, Usagi was eyeing
everyone&#39;s desert. Ami was studying one of her books, Makoto was just
enjoying the day and Minako was chatting away about a necklace she saw
in the mall. The other classes passed quickly also and at three o&#39;clock
school was let out.

Everyone headed home to change before going to Rei&#39;s for their study
group. Makoto decided to bring something light for a snack. &quot;Cheese and
crackers should do it. Just whip up some special cheese dip and I&#39;m
good to go.&quot; She had changed into a pair of jeans and a white T-shirt.

When everything was ready she took one last look in the mirror, put on
her baseball cap and headed out the door. The walk there was
uneventful, she was mostly lost in thoughts about Minako. She was
halfway up the temple steps when she heard her named called. Turning
she saw Minako start her way up. &#39;Gosh she looks great, perfect. Not
that she could look any other way.&#39; She was wearing a pair of low rise
khakis and a blue baby-T with a pink heart on the front. Makoto waited
for her to catch up, the temples steps were a pain alone, but with
someone else they seemed to move faster.

&quot;Hurry up slow poke,&quot; Makoto teased. She only had about five more steps
to cover and she had jogged most of the way up.

&quot;Oh ha ha. I busted my butt up here and you know it,&quot; she brushed her
bangs out of her eyes and they continued on up.

&quot;Yeah, I know, but I just couldn&#39;t resist bugging you. That outfit
looks really great on you by the way. Is it new?&quot;

&quot;Mmm hmm. I got it at the mall the other day. They had a lot of new
spring and summer stuff in.&quot; Minako said unconsciously smoothing her
pants with a smile.

&#39;See, I can do this. I feel like it&#39;s like old times again. She really
does look perfect.&#39; Makoto stealthily snatched Minako&#39;s satchel from
her and explained, &quot;It&#39;s the least I can do for you in return for you
taking care of me yesterday, so don&#39;t think of protesting. Anyway you
know you love it when someone else carries your books,&quot; she laughed
knowing she had caught the blonde.

Minako laughed too. &quot;Alright you got me there. I hate carrying those
things. It&#39;s not like any of us, besides Ami, are going to study
today.&quot;

&quot;I know. I guess it&#39;s just a nice excuse for us to meet and just gab.&quot;
&#39;And another opportunity for me to spend time with you,&#39; Makoto thought
to herself. &quot;Hey are you doing anything after this?&quot;

Minako thought for a moment, her brow creasing right between her
eyebrows in such a cute way, the corner of her twisting up as her eyes
search the air for an answer. Looking back over at her tall companion
she smiled. &quot;Nope, not that I know of, but I bet that&#39;s going to change
isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Makoto laughed, &quot;Yeah, your pretty smart for a change,&quot; she teased.
&quot;Having a rare non-blonde moment aren&#39;t you- hey-ow.&quot; She laughed more
as Minako playfully whapped her. Rubbing her arm in mock injury she
continued. &quot;You want to go to the mall later? I wouldn&#39;t mind checking
out those new clothes.&quot; Actually there was something else she wanted to
check out but Minako didn&#39;t have to know that yet.

&quot;Sure that would be great. I&#39;ll ask the others if they want to come
too.&quot; They had finally reached the top of the steps but Makoto stopped
and gently took Minako&#39;s hand halting her.

&quot;Actually I just wanted it to be us, as a way to ...umm.. make up for
the time you spent over at my place.&quot; Makoto looked down and released
Minako&#39;s hand. &#39;Man I hope that doesn&#39;t sound too strange. Oh no,
please don&#39;t see my blush. I was doing so well. I have to think of
another reason why I don&#39;t want the other girls coming along.&#39; Just
then they heard both of their names being yelled. Looking behind them
they saw Usagi start racing up the steps toward them. Makoto looked
back to Minako and said quickly, &quot;Plus I don&#39;t think I can take anymore
of Usagi&#39;s bluntness about my appearance today without retaliating in
some violent way if you get my drift. Rei will probably be the same way
and Ami will want to study more before going. So for the safety of the
princess it should just be us.&quot; She nodded. That sounded reasonable
enough.

Minako was laughing at the thought of Makoto beating the snot out of
Usagi. &quot;Alright alright, for the safety of our princess then.&quot; They
both knew Makoto would never raise a hand against any of her friends,
but they also knew what a handful Usagi could be. Minako looked back
down the steps, Usagi was about three quarters of the way up and was
severely winded. She was now taking one step sluggishly at a time. She
yelled down at her, &quot;Come on meatball head. We can&#39;t wait all day.&quot;

* * * * *

The mall was crowded with people. Makoto and Minako were weaving their
way through the mass of bodies and bags trying to get to the next sale.
So far they hadn&#39;t bought anything, they weren&#146;t really planning to
either. Window shopping and trying on outrageous outfits they would
never buy or wear could be so much more fun than actually shopping.

Minako stopped in front of one of the jewelry stores and looked
longingly through one of the tiny box windows. Makoto had to back track
a little and stood behind her wondering what caught her attention.
There on a piece of black velvet was a simple looking necklace. The
chain was very fine and petite. On it were three small silver circles
enclosing a separate gem. The two on the outside were a strange blue
green color. They looked too blue to be emeralds and too green to be
sapphires. They weren&#39;t aquamarines either. It was very unique. The
middle one held a diamond. &#39;That must be the necklace she was talking
about at lunch today. Those bluish stones would bring out her eyes so
well.&#39; Makoto barely caught the sigh that softly escaped Minako&#39;s lips.
She watched her shoulders slump a little as she turned to find the next
store.

They entered a shoe store and sat down to rest their feet. A salesman
approached them and asked if they needed any help. &quot;Not at the moment,
thanks.&quot; Minako replied in a less than peppy voice.

&#39;I think its about time we called it day. She doesn&#39;t look like she&#39;s
having as much fun as before.&#39; Makoto stood and offered a hand to her
friend. &quot;I&#39;m beat, you wanna go to your place or my place or the arcade
or something?&quot;

Minako smiled up at her and took the helping hand to haul herself up.
&quot;Let&#39;s go to my place. I&#39;m kind of in the middle of playing Sailor V.
Plus it would be nice to have you over for dinner for a change. I&#39;m
sure my parents won&#39;t mind.&quot; Makoto nodded and the headed for the
Aino&#39;s residence.
