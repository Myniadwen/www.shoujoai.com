<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 15 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><p>…</p><p>Rei didn’t know how long she had been staring at that empty doorway. Minako’s 
footsteps had stopped echoing long ago, but it was only beginning to sink in that she had 
left. Her gaze lowered to the floor.</p><p><i>What in the name of Mars, just happened?</i> 
Unconsciously, she raised her hand up to her lips.</p><p>At first, she was angry with the 
Venusian; how could this be all her fault? Minako was the one who barged into her room, into 
her private space, and then had the nerve to suddenly do <i>that </i>out of the blue. She 
was lucky that she hadn’t been closer to the bed when she was tackled-- otherwise, she could 
be been lying on the floor with a concussion at this very instant. And on top of all that, 
Minako bolted out of the room without even giving her a chance to speak.</p><p>Rei glanced 
around the room, finally taking notice at how cluttered it was, when she caught her 
reflection staring back at her from one of the armor pieces. Out of morbid curiosity, she 
found herself picking up the shoulder plate for a closer look. What she saw brought a frown 
to her delicate face. Her cheeks were still burning red, and her long hair was an absolute 
mess. And her lips—she didn’t even want to get started on that. Her heart skipped a beat as 
she remembered how it felt when Minako’s lips first touched hers, their softness and warmth. 
A loud crash resounded throughout the room when the shoulder plate destroyed a nearby lamp, 
and rolled to a stop somewhere out of sight.</p><p>“She keeps saying that it was my fault, 
but that can’t be true! She was the one who did THAT to me! She was the one who is always 
touchy-touchy. And I certainly wasn’t begging for it!”</p><p>“<i>Look, you aren’t getting 
out of this that easily. What are you trying to hide from me? Obviously something bad 
happened and it was bad enough to make you cry. It doesn’t have anything to do with that 
phone call, does it?” </i></p><p>“<i>Actually, it doesn’t. You don’t believe me? Well, 
believe it or not, it really doesn’t. This is all...your fault, you know?”</i></p><p>Rei 
felt like she was on the verge of screaming and pulling her hair out. <i>What on Mars did I 
do?! </i> <i>Sure, she came in crying, but then she was joking around like everything was 
fine!</i> <i>So was she really fine or was she pretending to be upset, 
or...?</i></p><p>“Arrgh!!”</p><p>Regardless of what the answer was, it didn’t change the 
fact of what she did.</p><p>‘<i><b>Slap!’</b></i></p><p>She drove her away; she hit her 
across the cheek, and it hadn’t been a light slap either. The memory made the proud woman 
cringe. Rei remembered the way her hand felt after she had slapped her. She had done it once 
before, back on Mars shortly before their confrontation with Uranus’s army, but it had felt 
different from back then. Now it was all sinking in. She came to grip that what she feeling 
was guilt. The shocked expression on <i>her</i> face--it still burnt vividly within her 
mind. Minako had looked genuinely hurt after she had pushed her away. Rei almost couldn’t 
understand it: How could a single action have so much impact on a person?</p><p>Rei wrinkled 
her nose at her hand as if it was dirty. “I made her cry...again.” She bit her bottom lip 
and squeezed her hand shut. “But <i>why</i> did she do that? Like, I know she’s an unusually 
affectionate person, but that, that was...” Was it some sort of bizarre Venusian custom? She 
recalled how Minako had been crying moments before that; her shirt was free from the tears 
that had been shed onto it, but it was still wrinkled in places where the woman had gripped 
it tightly.</p><p>“The last time we fought, I admit that I really never gave her a chance to 
speak what was on her mind, but she can be just as stubborn. Is that why she was upset?”Rei 
picked herself up and began to pace on the spot for a moment. No matter how she approached 
it, she wasn’t going to get an answer unless she directly asked Minako herself.</p><p>“Women 
are so bothersome...” She muttered under her breath. She then shook her head, “No, just the 
ones from Venus and Neptune. Heh, anyway, I guess I should go and see her. Better now than 
later...”</p><p><i>I don’t need Haruka or any of the others finding out about this. </i>She 
was already starting to feel a little better. <i>It has to be some sort of misunderstanding. 
I’ll just talk to Minako, and things will just go back to normal.</i></p><p><i>And maybe, 
she’ll laugh at me and tell me how good she got me with that 
joke.</i></p><p><b>Tup…tup…tup…</b></p><p><u>(Palace 
Corridors)</u></p><p><i><b>Creeeeak</b></i><b>.</b></p><p>“Minako…?” Rei found herself 
staring into another dark room, but it also appeared to be empty. It didn’t look like she 
was here either. With a resigned sigh, she closed the door and stepped back out into the 
cool hallway where she was embraced by darkness once again. She had already searched half of 
the guest’s quarters but there was still no sign of the bouncy diplomat.</p><p><i>Where on 
Mars could she have gotten to?</i></p><p>“Minako?” She called again for good measure and 
cringed when her voice echoed louder than she had anticipated it to.</p><p><i>Okay, no more 
of that. The others must have re-activated the planet shield by now. Who knows where they’re 
wandering about?</i> <i>I mean, if Zen was here then he would have blow-</i></p><p>“Oh for!” 
Rei smacked her forehead. “What am I doing?!” She hissed at herself. In her urgency to find 
Minako, she had forgotten that she didn’t have to use the traditional ‘human’ 
methods.</p><p>Still grumbling “what’s wrong with me,” and mentally kicking herself, she 
began to release strands of her powers into the corridor. She was only a few seconds into 
the spell when she sensed something unusual.</p><p><i>That’s strange. Where is all of this 
spiritual energy coming from? </i>As her powers continued to prod through the walls, she 
discovered broken clusters of aquamarine aura still floating about. They flickered like 
small orbs of light. Rei gasped. <i>That’s-! No, that can’t be. But she’s been gone for 
years! </i>She thought back to their encounter with the spectre earlier during their 
investigation. Her brow furrowed deep in thought. <i>A ghost can’t possibly use their powers 
after they’ve passed away, could they? So then, could this be the remains of her spiritual 
trail? For people, the trail disappears fairly quickly, but perhaps it takes longer for a 
God’s to disappear?</i></p><p>In the background, Rei could hear the trickling of running 
water. One of her strands had penetrated into the gravesite; it appeared that the guest 
chambers weren’t far from the underground cavern as she thought they were.</p><p><i>We’re 
still deep underground. Since it was a huge fight, I suppose it’s not impossible that some 
of their aura was left behind. </i>Still, the discovery had given her quite the scare. The 
young Martian Commander largely underestimated the task of staying calm in such a 
nightmare-ish place. Rei, by no means, was afraid of the dark-- it was just this one 
location that made her flesh crawl.</p><p><b>Tup…tup…tup…</b></p><p>It did raise an 
interesting question however. Why was Neptune’s ghost still haunting the 
palace?</p><p><i>Why is she still here? </i>Rei continued her search, watching for any 
sudden leaps in energy. <i>She passed away a long time ago. She should have moved on! What 
could be holding her back? Is she angry for what happened? Does Michiru know that she’s 
still here...?</i></p><p>She couldn’t imagine how the proud Goddess would react if she knew 
that her dead mother’s spirit was wandering the halls at night with the same, vacant 
expression that she wore as she walked to her death.</p><p><b>Tup…tup…tup…</b></p><p>Rei 
shrugged off the cold atmosphere, and instead decided to divert all of her concentration to 
her efforts. What she needed to do was find Minako. With the planet shield up, their shadow 
enemies should be unable to enter Neptune. However, in the Martian’s past experiences, 
nothing was ever guaranteed in life.</p><p><i>Where is that damn woman?! </i>Rei was 
beginning to feel frustrated.<i> How far could she have possibly 
gone?</i></p><p><b>…</b><b>ping…</b></p><p><i>Hm? </i>She felt her heart skip a beat at the 
sound. There was a large spiritual presence nearby. “Minak-” Rei was about to call out, but 
she suddenly bit her tongue. Wait a minute, that wasn’t Minako’s aura. She tried to hone in 
on it, but, to her surprise, the source suddenly flickered and fizzled out. It was on the 
move. Rei halted her area-wide search and threw her energies after the elusive signature. 
Was it the enemy?</p><p><i>What’s going on? Is it getting closer?! </i>Dark amethyst eyes 
narrowed in frustration. As she tracked the one strand, she found other faint trails of a 
similar type converging into view. In her bewilderment she failed to detect the presence 
lurking in the shadows behind her. <i>W-Where is it coming from?! </i>She whipped her 
spiritual vision about the retreating strands. <i>I don’t hear any footsteps, so it can’t 
possibly be a shadow assassin. No efficient killer is that clumsy. Then, could it be one of 
the others? Did one of them come back to check up on me? But... if that was the case, then 
why play this game of hide-and-go-seek?! It’s almost something Haruka wou-</i></p><p>She 
half-expected Haruka to come up from behind her and say ‘gotcha’.</p><p><i>Behind</i>, the 
realization came too late when she took a wild guess at who it 
was.</p><p><i>Michiru?!</i></p><p><b>…</b><b>ping… 
Shrooooooooooom</b></p><p><b>Tup…tup…tup…</b></p><p>Rei went absolutely rigid and felt the 
blood drain from her face. Her earlier ponderings of why the ghost still lurked in the 
palace flew back into her face when the spectre emerged from the shadows behind her. She 
swallowed hard. Slowly, Rei craned her neck and confirmed her worst fears. No, it wasn’t 
Michiru.</p><p>A long, aquamarine braid swishing side to side, and a blue 
dress…</p><p><b>Lubb dubb!</b></p><p><i>It’s her!</i></p><p>“W-What do you want?”Rei 
whispered and slowly backed away towards the nearby wall as if it were her lifeline. She 
hugged it tight, hoping she could be lucky twice in one visit.</p><p><i>Please, please, 
please go away…</i> Rei silently chanted in her head. It occurred to her to run, but she 
wasn’t sure if she could possibly outrun someone who was already dead.</p><p><i>I-I wasn’t 
looking for you! So why are you here? Please don’t look this way, please don’t see me. I’m 
not here, I’m-</i></p><p><b>Tup…tup…tup.</b></p><p>The elder Neptune stepped forward but 
suddenly stopped in front of her, leaving only a short distance between her and the heir of 
Mars.</p><p>Rei sucked in breath and squirmed back against the wall in a futile attempt to 
create more distance. She could feel her heart pounding 100mph in her chest as the tall 
spectre slowly turned its head in her direction. Instantly, there was a cold, prodding 
pressure against her skin that made her blood run cold. It started from the boots on her 
feet and swept up to the hairs on her head, before trailing slowly back down. Rei couldn’t 
clearly make out her eyes through the darkness, but she knew the former Goddess was looking 
ather.</p><p>In the background, the Martian could make out the strands of energy fusing back 
with the spectre. As they returned to their master, the darkness around the spectre began to 
diminish. She was almost glowing now-- the remnants of her life energy surrounding her with 
a thin veil of aquamarine light.</p><p>It terrified Rei.</p><p>“Wha…what do you want from 
me?” Rei demanded once she had found her voice again. It sounded hoarse to her ears. Out of 
everyone that resided in the palace, why had the deceased ruler appeared before 
her?</p><p>“<i>So she died trying to protect you?” </i></p><p>“<i>I didn’t ask for 
it…”</i></p><p>“<i>Rei! What would she say if she heard you say that?” </i></p><p>To the 
Martian’s horror, Neptune took a step towards her.</p><p><b>Tup---</b></p><p>“No! Stay 
back!”</p><p><b>Crackle!</b></p><p><b>CRACKLE!</b></p><p>Rei’s jaw dropped when her red aura 
was easily deflected by Neptune’s and was sent hurtling into a back wall behind the 
Goddess.</p><p><i>I-Impossible! How was she able to deflect my attack?! Her aura is so 
faint! </i>She gasped. <i>Or, could it be...?</i></p><p>She stumbled backwards, feeling 
suddenly lightheaded. The attack had done more than damaged her pride--it forced her back 
into a corner, into the past, where she found herself face to face with a painful reality. 
In the past, on Mars, no matter how hard she trained or pushed herself to grow up faster she 
couldn’t match up with the God of War. And now, when she thought she had made significant 
progress, had become strong enough to lead a planet and worthy enough to fight alongside her 
friends, she found herself facing surrender against a <i>dead </i>Goddess.</p><p><i>Is the 
reason that I can’t defeat her, is because she’s a Goddess? </i>She almost wanted to laugh. 
<i>Even a dead one, with such a weak aura... Is this the difference between us? 
</i></p><p><i>Am I that weak?</i></p><p>“What do you want?” Rei asked almost sulkily. She 
never knew how much she resembled her child-self at that minute. Still the ghost said 
nothing.</p><p>She felt shivers run down her back when the spectre began to reach out a hand 
towards her. What did she want from her? Rei’s pupil’s contracted as the glowing, 
transparent hand was inches from her face now.</p><p>“Neptune.”</p><p><b>Ping!</b></p><p>The 
name echoed throughout the corridor for a few seconds. It had started sounding so faint and 
weak at first, like a whisper in the wind. But as soon as the word left Rei’s lips, the name 
gained the strength of the individual it had represented. It gained power. By the time it 
reached the palace walls the name sounded very loud, commanding, and bore a royal tone to 
it. Even Rei was astonished; she never expected such a phenomenon to happen. The walls 
themselves appeared to acknowledge the name as well. Beginning like a ripple in a pond, one 
side of wall began to emit an aquamarine glow before spreading along the rest of the passage 
like a river.</p><p><i>W-What’s happening?</i> Mars’s heir continued to gape in awe. Her 
breath had been taken away.</p><p>The young woman received her answer when the apparition 
stopped in its tracks. Neptune retracted her hand and began to step away. For some reason, 
Rei suddenly felt her heart ache. What was this emotion that filled the air 
now?</p><p><i>Sadness...? </i>The word manifested in her mind. <i>What? </i>“H-Hey!”<i> What 
the—her aura is getting stronger!</i></p><p>Rei braced herself into a defensive stance when 
she saw Neptune raise a pale hand from her 
side.</p><p>“AHH!”</p><p><i><b>Swish—</b></i><b>FOOM!</b></p><p>A bright aquamarine light 
erupted in the area, covering the floor, the walls and the ceiling. What previous light 
there was beforehand was intensified so greatly that Rei could not see Neptune past the veil 
covering. Again a wave of uncertainty hit the young woman. Was the former ruler going to 
finish her off while she was blinded?</p><p><b>FOOooommm…</b><br><b><br></b>When the light 
finally died down, Rei blinked back in wonder and surprise. She wasn’t dead. There was no 
blood, searing pain, or the sight of her dead, lifeless body lying in the corridor. She 
hadn’t been the one who changed. Instead, she was greeted by the sight of the once dark 
corridor filled with glowing, floating spheres.</p><p>Rei tentatively reached out to touch 
one of the ghostly spheres that had drifted nearby. At first contact, strange warmth 
trickled through the woman’s fingers like a spill of warm water before the sphere broke and 
dissipated into a shower of blue powder.</p><p>“Ah…!” Rei pulled her hand back in surprise. 
She hadn’t been expecting that; not that she’d ever seen something like it before 
anyway.</p><p>She turned her head towards the rest of the spheres, eyeing them all with 
suspicion. From what she saw next, she knew the unknown entities were not there for 
leisurely idling. They began to part to both sides of the corridor until they created a path 
that was lit by two rows of these strange lights. What was Neptune up to? Was there 
somewhere that she wanted the heir to go? Momentarily Rei felt a stab of annoyance at the 
thought of being led around like some dumb animal, yet her logical side couldn’t stay quiet 
and instead refuted the childish anger with the logic that she had been planning on going 
down this corridor anyway.</p><p><i>Minako…</i></p><p>The reason why she had been wandering 
aimlessly all this time came back to her.</p><p>Although Rei was confused at why Neptune 
hadn’t sought revenge for her grudge, since the Goddess <i>had</i> haunted the Martian twice 
during her visit, she would rather not push it. With that in mind, she once again set off 
down the newly lighted corridor.</p><p><u>(Underground Cavern)</u></p><p>Rei came skidding 
to a stop just before she hit the water’s edge. This was where the trail ended, but the area 
appeared to be vacant.</p><p><i>Huh? Why am I back here?</i>She couldn’t help but wonder why 
this place was so special. Taking a deep breath, and gulping hard, Rei did a quick check and 
dispersed strands of her power along the bottom of the cavern’s floor. There was the 
occasional obstruction by the uneven ground or a pebble but she could not sense anything 
unusual.</p><p><i>That’s strange...I don’t sense anything here. </i>She glanced around the 
cavern with her spiritual vision, finding nothing other than broken strands of aura. In this 
particular area, she could find both red and aquamarine traces left over from the fight long 
ago but there was still no sign of Minako. Well, wasn’t that peachy? She was tempted to just 
leave and scratch this whole escapade off as a waste of time.</p><p>Out of her peripheral 
vision, she noted that the spiritual lights had yet to fade. Rei turned around and attempted 
to step forward back onto the path, and, to her surprise, nothing happened. She took another 
shaky step before turning on the spot and returned to the water’s edge to ponder 
this.</p><p>She couldn’t quite describe the feeling, but there was a nagging feeling that 
she shouldn’t be so hasty.</p><p><i>Maybe, I’ll take another look around after 
all.</i></p><p>Inwardly shrugging, Rei pulled her consciousness back and cautiously tread 
into the water. As she waded to the center of the cavern, she could sense her powers 
complete their grid-like search; the entire bottom floor was now covered by a net-like grid. 
For security purposes, the soldier left it out as she continued her 
investigation.</p><p><i><b>Sploosh, sploosh, sploosh…</b></i></p><p>After approximately 
twenty minutes of ‘playing’ in the water and still finding nothing, Rei was becoming 
impatient. Several of times of slipping and falling, needless to say, she was soaked to the 
bone. She was beginning to wonder if this was Neptune’s revenge: if it was one thing that 
didn’t mix well, it was Martians and water.</p><p>“This is just so stupid! What am I 
supposed to be looking for anyway?” Rei grumbled under her breath. She sniffled and crinkled 
her nose, resisting the urge to sneeze. She had half a mind to go back to dry land and warm 
herself up when she heard someone bellow her name.</p><p>“REEEEI! Where are you?!”</p><p>Rei 
whipped her head at the sound. <i>Minako?! </i>She stood frozen for a moment, trying to 
identify the approaching signature. They had a similar coloured aura to the Venusian, but, 
no, it wasn’t Minako. She stared intently at the entrance until she saw Uranus Haruka come 
sliding to a stop, just avoiding an unpleasant plunge into the water.</p><p>“Rei? Is that 
you?! I’ve been looking all over for you!”</p><p>Rei stared at her friend for a moment 
longer, taking careful note of her dishevelled appearance.</p><p><i>She was looking for me? 
Well, isn’t that ironic. It seems like everyone is looking for someone 
today.</i></p><p>“...Haruka.” She curtly nodded.</p><p>“Hah…hah…whew… Jeez, you’re so hard 
to find sometimes! Why’d you go and bury yourself down here of all places?” She peered 
around, giving her eyes a chance to adjust to the dim lighting. While the woman was 
distracted, Rei’s dark eyes glanced behind her and dryly noted how the ghostly lights had 
vanished. Great, now she was back to square one.</p><p>Rei heard a splashing when Haruka 
stepped into the water and began to wade towards her. For a split-second she felt a breeze 
brush up against her and involuntarily shivered. Haruka was really beginning to test her 
patience with that trick.</p><p>“You’re soaking wet! What were you doing, taking a 
swim?”</p><p>“Of course not! I wouldn’t be down here if it weren’t 
for-”</p><p>“For?”</p><p>“Never mind. You said you were looking for me, right? Well, what 
did you want?”</p><p>“Ohh...I caught you at bad time, huh?” Haruka was a few meters away 
now. Rei had turned her back to her, subtly giving her the hint that she didn’t want to be 
bothered right now. “Well, that’s too bad, because I’m not in the best of moods right now 
either. I’m going to be blunt with you Rei. Minako’s gone-- did you have anything to do with 
it?”</p><p>“...Gone?”</p><p>“I mean, as in off of this planet gone.” Haruka crossed her arms 
and stared at the woman with a frown. “She took one of the shuttles and left before the 
planet shield was reactivated. Michiru’s gone to investigate it, but I thought there might 
be a faster way to get some answers.”</p><p>Rei could hardly believe it. “That’s why you’re 
here? You think it’s my fault that she left? Just what are you accusing me of?”</p><p>“I’m 
not accusing you of anything! It’s just, you two seemed close. I was just wondering if you 
knew anything about it. Like... did she say anything to you, like she was thinking about 
leaving or anything like that?”</p><p>“No. She didn’t...”</p><p>“Oh. I see.”</p><p>“I didn’t 
even know she was gone until you mentioned it.”</p><p>“Is that so? I’m sorry, I thought you 
knew.” Haruka turned her head away awkwardly. Now what was she going to say? No doubt Rei 
was going to have some questions, and she wasn’t about to be disappointed.</p><p>“So, you’re 
saying that she left the planet? Do you know where she’s headed?”</p><p>Haruka hesitated, 
but only for a moment. “The shuttle’s navigation path is set for Venus. She’s going 
home.”</p><p>Rei had half-expected that answer, but actually hearing it was an entirely 
different matter. She almost felt like laughing. It was all falling into place now; it was 
no wonder she couldn’t detect the Venusian earlier. This entire time, while she was rushing 
around like a clueless idiot, ignorant and guilt-ridden, Minako had already left Neptune’s 
orbit. She was going to be out of her reach forever.</p><p>But why did she leave? Did she 
finally open her eyes and see what she was? Or did she simply get what she came to Mars for 
and decided that she had enough? Rei didn’t even want to consider the third option. Minako 
had left without a word-- it was plain and simple.</p><p>“Well, doesn’t that just solve 
everything?” Rei whispered under her breath.</p><p>Haruka was starting to feel uneasy when 
Rei started to chuckle to herself.</p><p>“Rei...? Is everything okay?”</p><p><i>Just like 
that. She does that and then leaves without a word! Or...could it be that she leave because 
of that? </i></p><p>‘<i><b>Slap!’</b></i></p><p>‘My fault.’ The words echoed loudly and 
deeply within her.</p><p>“...It’s nothing. Is that all you wanted to tell 
me?”</p><p>“Nothing?” Haruka was incredulous. “Is that all you’ve got to say for 
yourself?”</p><p>“What did you expect me to say?”</p><p>Haruka sighed. “Rei...you know I 
respect you for being a very logical person, and I know you’re probably a little bit sore 
about all of this... but are you really just going to let her go? If you do, you might 
regret it for the rest of your life.”</p><p>“Regret...?” There was some bite in her tone. 
“If she wants to go home, then why should I stop her?”</p><p>“Because you care about 
her.”</p><p>“...You don’t even know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“Actually, I think I 
do. I’ve seen what you’re like when you two are together. Do you really expect me to believe 
that she means nothing to you, not even as a friend?”</p><p>“Heh, a friend? That’s a good 
one. I barely know her. She just dropped in on Mars one day and I’ve been stuck with her 
ever since.”</p><p>“You’re avoiding the question.” When Rei didn’t respond, Haruka tried 
another approach. “Back on Uranus, it sounded like you were pretty worried about her going 
home. In fact, you were so worried about her well-being that you stayed by her side in the 
infirmary until she woke up.”</p><p>“You were spying there too?” She growled.</p><p>“No. I 
heard it from two little birdies.” Haruka smiled. “I had my doubts at first, but it must’ve 
been true since you didn’t bother to deny it.”</p><p>This earned a scowl from the Martian. 
“That doesn’t mean anything. She was under my protection at the time, so why wouldn’t I be 
there?”</p><p>“So...you’re claiming it’s all for duty? In that case, why did you decide to 
stop protecting her?” She sensed Rei’s hesitation and pressed on. “There’s something that 
still doesn’t seem right to me. From what I know about her, she doesn’t strike me as the 
type to take off without a reason. Michiru thought so too. For instance, that call she got 
awhile back... Didn’t that seem odd to you?” She noticed that she had Rei’s undivided 
attention, and was pleased that she was making progress. “It might have just been me, but 
Minako looked almost scared to answer it. What if the call was from Aphrodite? What if 
Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love, found out about what Minako did on Uranus? I mean, taking 
over a planet isn’t exactly small news. If her mother found out about her involvement, she 
could be in big trouble.”</p><p>“If that’s the case... Then she should face the consequences 
of her decision. Before we came to Neptune, she said she would when the time 
came.”</p><p>“<i>Is this what it’s about? Are you worried about what my mother would 
think?”</i></p><p>“<i>...”</i></p><p>“<i>Just so you know... it doesn’t 
matter.”</i></p><p>“<i>...”</i></p><p>“<i>Look, I know what I did. And yes, I killed some 
people. But, that was my choice. I chose to do that. I did, what I thought was right... If 
I’m going to be punished for what I did, then I’ll accept it when the time 
comes.”</i></p><p>“Brave words... I’m kind of impressed, but it doesn’t mean that she isn’t 
scared.” Haruka pointed out. “How many times have you had a God tell you you’re going to be 
punished and not feel even a tiny bit worried? Getting beaten up and left barely alive was 
almost like a relief, don’t you think?”</p><p>“It’s her mother.”</p><p>“And you think she’ll 
go easier on her because of it? Remember, she’s from a planet that looks down on murder the 
most, AND she’s a royal.”</p><p>“She’s the only heir.”</p><p>“Are you sure about 
that?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Haruka shook her head and ignored the questioning look. “Tch. So 
really don’t care what happens to her. You’re just going to let it all end like that, 
without a fight. That’s pretty cold, even for you.”</p><p>“A fight?” The comment struck a 
nerve. “Is that what you want from me? You want me to go and pick a fight with a God? Tch, 
what are the chances that a human could win a battle like that?” Her earlier run in with 
Neptune’s ghost left a scar on her pride. She couldn’t even beat a shadow of a God, never 
mind standing a chance against a living one. “All right... For argument’s sake, let’s say 
that I happened to win by a fluke. Then what? I’m sure that would go over well with Minako: 
Sorry, but I had to beat your mother up. Hope we can still be fr...friends...”</p><p>“That’s 
not what I meant.”</p><p>“Then what did you mean?”</p><p>Both sides came to a stalemate. 
Haruka had a good enough mind to just walk away and let the Martian sulk in misery, but that 
was also the reason why she couldn’t leave. Regardless of how infuriatingly, thick-headed 
the woman was, Rei was still her best friend and she knew that she was hurt. She never 
imagined that Rei would be the last one to find out; at the very least, she figured that Rei 
would be the one person Minako would say good-bye to.</p><p>“I’m leaving.”</p><p>“Wait a 
minute--” Haruka opened her mouth to say more, but she then sensed Michiru’s presence flood 
into the area. Judging by the haste that it came and left, Rei was getting bad vibes about 
it.</p><p>“What was that about?” Rei asked once the third party left. She didn’t like this 
uncomfortable silence. “...Haruka?”</p><p>Still, the other woman held her tongue for a 
moment. She wasn’t sure how to break this to her friend.</p><p>“That was Michiru. It looks 
like we now know why Minako left. Venus has been invaded...” She darkly 
muttered.</p><p>“What…? Invaded? By who? When?!”</p><p>“It’s bad. It’s Mars, Rei.”</p><p>Rei 
felt her blood run cold. “B-But that’s impossible! I didn’t give any orders 
to-”</p><p>“...Mars Ares.” Haruka finished. It was like a final blow to the Martian. “We 
can’t pinpoint his exact location at the moment, but apparently he’s on the move. Michiru 
says he’s already encountered the Venusian army, but they’re having trouble holding their 
own. Like I said, it’s pretty bad.”</p><p>Rei balled her hand into a tight fist. “Ares, 
huh?”</p><p><i>...Ares.</i> Rei wasn’t sure if she was breathing anymore; the one she had 
been waiting for all of these years, the one who betrayed the Planetary Alliance, her 
mentor, was about to set Venus ablaze in flame.</p><p><i>But that’s where...</i></p><p>Was 
Minako aware of that?</p><p>As if she read the Martian’s expression, Haruka said, “He’s 
probably after Aphrodite’s bloodline. As much as I hate to say this, if you don’t go she’ll 
probably die.”</p><p><i><b>Lubb Dubb!</b></i></p><p><i>Why me? She was the one who said she 
didn’t want to be protected anymore. </i>It was almost too ironic for words. If it wasn’t 
the heir of Mars that would be the death of her, it would be its ruler.</p><p>Haruka was 
quickly losing her patience. “Didn’t you just hear what I said? Forget the punishment from 
her mother! Ares is going to kill her if you don’t do anything!”</p><p>Rei gritted her 
teeth.</p><p>“Rei!”</p><p>“What do you want from me?! If you care about her that much then 
why don’t you go and rescue her yourself?!”</p><p><i><b>Crackle!</b></i></p><p>Rei was 
knocked off of her feet by a bolt of gold lightning. She fell back-first into the water and 
sputtered as she struggled for balance.</p><p>“Because... it <i>has </i>to be you.” Haruka’s 
aura had dimmed, but it remained as a thin veil around her body and partially lit up the 
chamber. She could somewhat make out her friend’s features now, and, she was right, Rei 
<i>did</i> look miserable. “I can help you. But I can’t do this for you. I just don’t 
understand. Why are you being so stubborn about all of this...? Tell me honestly...does she 
really mean nothing to you?”</p><p>“...It doesn’t matter. Regardless of how I feel, I can’t 
go after her.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because...” Rei sighed. “Let’s say that we do go to 
Venus. And we save her. What happens after that? For all you know someone else might kill 
her.”</p><p>“Like who?”</p><p>“Me.”</p><p>Haruka was shocked that Rei could ever suggest 
such a thing, but she forced herself to keep a stern face.</p><p>“That’s 
ridiculous.”</p><p>“Hah!” Rei slowly picked herself out of the water, and fell 
silent.</p><p>“You’re hiding something from me, aren’t you?” Haruka watched her quietly. “It 
sounds like to me that there’s a lot more to this that you aren’t telling me.”</p><p>Rei 
took a deep breath, and straightened up. It was disgusting; just the thought of the battle 
from years ago, of all the blood spilt by Ares, was stirring her cravings again.</p><p>“It’s 
simple, really. She shouldn’t have let me live.” <i>If she knew, then she wouldn’t have 
sacrificed herself. </i></p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Neptune. Don’t you remember? She sacrificed 
herself for us. But if I hadn’t jumped in, she wouldn’t have had to.”</p><p>“Hey. I told 
you, that wasn’t anybody’s fault. It’s Apollo’s-- and isn’t that another good reason to go 
to Venus? Are you willing to let Ares take away someone else important to you?”</p><p>“I 
told you Haruka. I could kill her later...”</p><p>Haruka was ready to pull her hair out. 
“Grr...This is getting ridiculous! Stop talking all cryptic to me! What, exactly, are you 
trying to say?”</p><p>“I’m talking about...this.”</p><p>Haruka was forced to shield her eyes 
when a golden light erupted around the Martian. It wasn’t like her aura at all; it felt wild 
and violent, as if it were about to lash out at her at any moment. But as soon as it emerged 
out, Rei steadily reeled it in until it also surrounded her body in a thin veil of 
light.</p><p>A few seconds passed as Haruka struggled to recover from the shock. It wasn’t 
the crimson aura that she had always come to expect; there was something darker, and 
monstrous about it.</p><p>“Rei...?”</p><p>The Martian slowly tilted her chin up and stared 
her back in the face. There was something different glittering in her glowing eyes; Haruka 
wasn’t sure if her friend recognized her, or if she looked like a juicy piece of meat to 
devour.</p><p>“Get it now?” Rei winced as if she were in pain; every muscle fiber in her 
body was twitching as the instincts threatened to take over.</p><p>Haruka was at a loss. 
“Rei...what happened to you...?”</p><p>“You know why they call us barbarians? This is why.” 
Rei held her hand up and peered at the wild energy rushing around it. It was nearly bursting 
through her invisible restraints. <i>But you wouldn’t know that. No one does, except Him and 
me. </i>“If she stays near me... Minako will die. You will too...That’s why, you’re right. I 
need to leave, but not to Venus.”</p><p><i>I need to get out of here... </i>The warning 
bells were sounding off loudly in her head.</p><p>“I see.” <i>I kinda thought so. It’s just 
like on Uranus. “</i>That’s why you’ve been keeping your distance... you were worried that 
you’d hurt us. But... so what?”To Rei’s surprise, Haruka merely shook her head and smirked. 
“Listen, I don’t know how this came about, but I <i>know </i>that you weren’t always like 
this. You aren’t a bloodthirsty killer, Rei; you’re better than that. You’re my 
friend.”</p><p>“Haruka...”</p><p>“And who do you think you’re talking to? You really think 
you can kill me? You’ve been trying for years, but I’m still here.” She 
shrugged.</p><p>“Hah. Gimme a break.”</p><p>“...Seriously. We’ll find a way to deal with 
this.”</p><p>“There isn’t a cure.”</p><p>“Are you sure about that?” She saw Rei avert her 
gaze. “See? You don’t know that for sure. But if we let Ami and Michiru know, I’m 
sure-”</p><p>“Not Michiru.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Rei shook her head. “Don’t let Michiru know. 
Promise me Haruka, that you won’t tell her...”</p><p>“...Okay. I won’t tell her...for now, 
at least.” She could somewhat understand where Rei was coming from. Rei was afraid of how 
Michiru would react. “But this little thing isn’t stopping us from making a trip to Venus, 
right?” She smiled.</p><p>“Haruka...” Rei growled.</p><p>“I think it’s a fair deal. Besides, 
if you’re really worried about Minako you’d go. You still have to try, but it doesn’t have 
to be alone. Don’t worry. If you lose control, we’ll be there to stop you.”</p><p><i>We’ll? 
</i>That was when she noticed two other signatures in the area. <i>Heh. How long have 
they’ve standing been there?</i></p><p>“Yeah, sure.” She almost smiled at that.</p><p>“You 
don’t believe me? I’m hurt.” Haruka stepped back as Rei’s power began to dangerously swell 
again. <i>She won’t be able to hold it back for much longer. I better alert the others. 
</i></p><p><b>Rmm…rmm…rmm…</b></p><p>The place began to shake. Outside in the hallway, a 
green and blue aura joined together and formed a barricade that sealed off the 
area.</p><p>“Fine. See if you can!” The golden power snapped through the invisible 
restraints and flooded out into the area. The room was instantly bathed in the bright, 
golden light. “HARUKA!”</p><p><i>If you die, I won’t forgive you!</i></p><p>Haruka gazed at 
her friend with dead-serious eyes. She could feel all of it now. All of Rei’s pent up 
frustration and anger blasted through the chamber in waves of hot air and light. She took a 
deep breath. Through the light, she could make out Rei beginning to unsheathe the sword on 
her waist. This was it. She was going to fight her for real.</p><p><i>When a God or Goddess 
loses control over their emotions, their human side, they fall back onto their instincts, 
and leave behind a trail of destruction in their wake. But although she’s not a Goddess, Rei 
still has some serious power within her… </i>Haruka whipped out her hand and Uranus’s sword 
materialized in her palm of her hand. <i>This could get ugly if we don’t get it under 
control right away.</i></p><p>At the entrance of the cavern, Ami lightly touched Makoto’s 
arm. The taller woman appeared to be on the verge of being upset herself.</p><p><i>That’s 
what happened to me...</i> Her friend was losing all control just as she had on Uranus. As 
much as it pained Makoto to see this, in her heart she knew this was the only 
way.</p><p>There was one thing that Rei needed to understand, to be convinced of 
first.</p><p><b>RMM…RMM…RMM…</b></p><p><b>Tup…</b></p><p>“Rei…” Haruka growled in a low 
voice, her green eyes flashed dangerously. “Come on! Show me what you got! 
I’m...right...HERE!”</p><p>Rei brandished her sword and charged forward; Haruka reacted in 
turn. The wind ruler swung her sword, unleashing a stream of piercing wind towards her 
opponent.</p><p>“HAAAAAA!!!”</p><p><i><b>Slash---</b></i><b>BoOoOoOoOoOoM!</b></p><p>The 
Martian responded instantly and jerked to the side, narrowly avoiding the gust. A fleeting 
look of surprise crossed her face, just before her golden, glowing eyes narrowed in 
amusement.</p><p>Rei lunged forward, her sword raised, glowing with the gold energy, and 
took a swing at the tall woman. Haruka evaded the head strike, and found herself becoming a 
victim to the rhythm Rei was setting for them. She could barely take a swing at the Martian 
before she was forced to duck or jump back; Rei was giving her nothing.</p><p><i>She’s so 
fast! </i>Haruka saw the tip of a blade come down and threw her sword up to block it. “RRG!” 
She heard it before she saw it; the sound of snapping metal, followed by her sword 
shattering into tiny, indefinable pieces. “Wha-?”</p><p>She could only blink back in 
surprise when she felt pain register along her right shoulder and a foot mercilessly 
swinging around and crashed into the side of her face.</p><p><b>Whomp!</b></p><p>“Oof!” She 
briefly spun mid-air before she hit the water’s surface and skid across it in a series of 
half rolls, limbs flailing, before she finally came to a stop. The entire world was 
spinning.</p><p>“S-Shit...” Haruka spat out a mouthful of water and shook her head. “W-When 
did she get so strong?”</p><p>She raised a hand up to her shoulder guard. At first she 
thought Rei might have hit the gap between the pieces, but it was far worse than that- she 
had cut straight through her armor like it was nothing.</p><p><i>Where is that power coming 
from?!</i></p><p>In the distance, she could hear fighting still going on. Someone else had 
stepped in.</p><p><i><b>Tup!</b></i></p><p><b>Bam! Bam! Bam!</b></p><p>Haruka finally 
spotted the source of the gunfire. Ami had climbed onto a higher ledge of the cavern and was 
raining bullets to keep Rei subdued. At the same time, she spotted Makoto materializing her 
spear at the side.</p><p>“Hey! What are you doing? I can handle this!” Haruka shouted to the 
pair.</p><p>“I wouldn’t be too sure about that!” Makoto shouted back. The blonde followed 
the direction where she pointed and came to a startling realization:</p><p><i>None of the 
bullets are hitting her! </i>It was all starting to spell some serious trouble.</p><p>Haruka 
re-materialized her sword and jumped back into the fray. To the side, Makoto’s eyes met 
Ami’s above. The blue-haired genius had understood the predicament even before Jupiter 
hinted for a change of strategy; as Makoto went to join Haruka in the fight below Mercury’s 
current bullets were emptying the firing slot and were being replaced with a blue tipped 
brand.</p><p><b>Cha-chink—</b><i><b>clatter</b></i></p><p>“HAAAAAH!”</p><p><i><b>Tup!</b></i></p><p><i><b>Slash---</b></i><b>BoOoOoOoOoOoM!</b></p><p>“Damn!” 
Haruka cursed the miss. “I almost had her!”</p><p><i>This is really getting to be a pain in 
the ass. If only she’d hold still!</i> The wind ruler thought. Rei was drifting farther and 
farther away from her usual fighting pattern-- there were a lot of wild leaps and jerks that 
she hadn’t seen before. It was like she had transformed into a sword-carrying, animal 
acrobat.</p><p>As she raced forward to re-engage in close-hand combat with Rei, the Martian 
shot back out of range once again.</p><p>“The hell?! Stop running 
away!”</p><p><i><b>Slash---</b></i><b>BoOoOoOoOoOoM!</b></p><p><b>TUP!</b></p><p>Haruka fell 
back when Makoto charged forward, knowing full well of the change in strategy. She was very 
sensitive to sound; the wind informed her of Ami changing bullets before Jupiter had known. 
Without even looking, Haruka could see the blue symbol engraved into the new bullets with 
the blue aura.</p><p><i>So that’s it huh? </i>But there was one thing bothered her. 
<i>But... it still doesn’t make any sense! Where is that power coming from? She just keeps 
getting stronger and stronger, but what’s fuelling it? It’s like it’s a part of her, but at 
the same time it isn’t! </i></p><p>The Martian’s aura was still steadily flaring up, so much 
that the temperature of the room had begun to rise. As the fight persisted, the water level 
in the underground chamber continued to drop. Truthfully, Haruka was beginning to worry that 
they might actually need to bring Michiru in to stop her.</p><p>Makoto jumped up and caught 
Rei off-guard. She brought her spear down with a vertical slash so quickly that she forced 
the Martian to use her sword.</p><p><b>Tup! Tup! Tup! 
Tup!</b></p><p>“YAAAAH!”</p><p><i><b>Slash----Clash!</b></i></p><p>But the victory was 
short-lived once Makoto realized that she couldn’t out-muscle Rei. They were stuck in 
deadlock, sword against spear. In response Makoto planted her back foot down and pumped more 
of her aura into the duel, creating a higher swirl of wind. The Martian countered similarly, 
and soon a swirling column of air blasted all around the two combatants.</p><p><i>Rrgh...! 
C’mooon!</i></p><p>A backlash of their struggle scratched Makoto’s fingers, startling her 
and drew some blood. For a split-second, Rei’s gaze trained in hard on the red 
matter.</p><p>“AhhRRgh!”</p><p><i>Makoto...?</i> The red haze over her eyes flickered. 
<i>When did-? </i>Instead of lunging at the woman, she parried the spear, one-handed, and 
then drove the sword into the ground. A blast of flame leapt up and blocked the taller 
woman’s path for a precious few seconds more.</p><p><i>What‘s she doing--?! </i>Haruka heard 
Rei’s heart-rate leap. <i>Why did she throw her sword away?</i></p><p>Not to be the one to 
back down, Makoto threw her spear aside and immediately chased after her.</p><p>“Oh no, you 
don’t!”</p><p>Ami was quickly becoming frustrated as the two women began to engage in close 
hand-to-hand. She did her best to aim at Rei from where she was positioned, but she found 
that she couldn’t get a clear shot; Makoto was just too close.</p><p><i><b>Whup-Whap! 
Whap-Whap! Whap! Thud!</b></i></p><p><b>Tup!</b></p><p>“Don’t get too close!” Makoto heard 
Haruka call over to her. She was tempted to yell back and retort that her yelling was more 
distracting, but she was cut off by a light pressure hovering over her neck. The tall woman 
slightly shifted her weight, pushing Rei’s hand off center and instead grabbed at it. Her 
second hand clamped down hard on her friend’s shirt about her collar, feeling the weight for 
a brief second atop of her shoulders before she slammed her opponent into the watery 
floor.</p><p>Rei gasped.</p><p>Makoto swung her arm around and immediately dove, 
elbow-first. Rei twisted on the floor, taking advantage of it slipperiness, and kicked 
Makoto’s forward leg. The tall woman slipped. As she fell, Rei dragged her down and then 
tossed her up and over with her momentum. She had nearly slid into the opposite wall from 
the sheer strength of Rei’s throw.</p><p>“Hah…hah…” Makoto tried to catch her breath. She 
couldn’t believe how insanely difficult this was. “She just... keeps going and going! 
Doesn’t she get tired?”</p><p><i>But for a second there, I actually caught her. Even though 
her power keeps going up... Is it just me, or is she slowing down?</i></p><p>“Do it now!” 
Haruka shouted.</p><p>Mercury took aim and pulled the trigger, but the bullet just grazed 
Rei’s arm. She was back on the run.</p><p>“I knew it! She’s slowing down!” Haruka whispered 
to herself. “But her power is still going up. Why?!”</p><p><i>Something’s seriously 
wrong!</i></p><p>Rei’s vision had darkened considerably since the fight began. It had 
started like a transparent veil over her eyes, and then became bolder in colour as she 
caught the scent of blood. But now, as the fight carried on, it just started to fade 
altogether; it was almost as if a shadow was beginning to sit over her eyes. All of her 
senses were dulling. Or was it just her mind?</p><p>From the side, Haruka raised a hand and 
tightly grasped a stream of air left over from Rei and Makoto’s initial encounter; Rei 
yelped in surprise when the air encircled her and momentarily stopped her in her 
tracks.</p><p>“Ami, can you do a quick scan?!”</p><p>“I can’t! My computer is still 
broken!”</p><p>“Tch!!” With no other choice, Haruka boosted her hearing abilities as the 
wind continued to circle around the Martian. And what she found, she didn’t like at 
all.</p><p><i>Shit!</i> <i>Her body—it’s breaking down! Never mind about killing us, you’re 
going to kill yourself first! </i>Haruka gritted her teeth. It was no wonder she was slowing 
down. <i>Just what kind of technique is that?! It’s giving her a crazy huge boost in power, 
but it’s killing her! If we don’t stop her soon, she’ll be--</i></p><p>Her concentration was 
becoming punctured by Rei’s furious roars. She needed to think fast. Rei was still a tad too 
fast for Ami to hit. They needed a distraction.</p><p><i>I got it.</i></p><p>Taking her 
sword, Haruka grunted and cut deeply into her hand. She intently studied the Martian’s 
reaction as her blood hit the water and began to permeate through it. It was driving Rei’s 
bloodlust to new heights.</p><p><i>Blood!</i> The single word rang out in her mind. It felt 
like her body was going to die if she didn’t have it. With a possessed bellow, the Martian 
broke Haruka’s wind binds and blindly chased after the scent.</p><p>“Haruka, look out! She’s 
coming straight for you!” Makoto shouted.</p><p><i>That’s right... </i>“Come on!”<i> Just a 
little closer!</i> Haruka stubbornly waited for the shorter woman.</p><p>Once she was within 
range, her opponent lunged straight for her hand. Haruka moved at once; she pulled her 
injured hand back, luring her opponent forwards, then simultaneously knocked Rei’s head down 
with the other hand, hard, as her knee drove up into the woman’s abdomen. Rei grunted, but 
she wasn’t given the chance to retreat again. Haruka spun her around into a tight 
hold.</p><p>“Ami!”</p><p><b>Bam!</b></p><p>“G---AAAAH!!!!”Rei felt something pierce her left 
leg. She felt the bullet’s effects instantly: It was a cold, seeping feeling. The golden 
aura was being eaten away--Ami’s bullet was draining her of her strength.</p><p>Rei glowered 
up at the sniper who was trying to uphold a brave face. Despite their distance, Rei could 
discern the trembling of Ami’s hand. Her friend didn’t want to shoot her, but unconsciously 
they both knew it was necessary.</p><p>After a few seconds, Rei slumped slightly in Haruka’s 
grip-- suddenly her knees were beginning to feel weak. The red haze over her eyes was 
starting to lift.</p><p><i>W-ha...?</i></p><p>“<i>These battles against Gods and Goddesses… 
I won’t become one and be forced to fight against my friends!”<br></i><br>Her words rang 
back loud and clear.</p><p><i>What am I doing? Where am I?</i></p><p>Haruka sensed the 
sudden change in Rei’s condition. <i>It’s working! </i>Up above, she could see Ami taking 
aim again. “Do one more!”</p><p><b>Bam!</b></p><p>But Rei ripped out of Haruka’s grasp and 
evaded. As she scurried towards the outside perimeter of the cavern, she was gradually 
regaining her self-awareness. The first thing that registered was that her body was in a 
great deal of pain. Was she injured? She hit a slick patch of rock and stomped down on her 
left foot for balance; a sharp pain shot up her leg.</p><p>“Ouch! Wha-the?!” Rei’s whipped 
her head around and scanned the area, but her blurry vision refused to focus. The only thing 
she could clearly discern was the scent of blood in the area; her sense of smell magnified 
the scent greatly, but for some reason it was becoming too powerful. Why was it coming 
closer--</p><p>The smell of blood was suddenly in her face; another hand wrapped around and 
grabbed a fistful of her hair, pulling her close. “Is this how you want to live your life?” 
Someone hissed into her ear. Her head was forcibly shoved into the 
water.</p><p><i><b>Splash!</b></i></p><p><i>If you’re going to do something, whatever it is, 
you have to do it with everything you’ve got! Especially you, Rei… people with a limited 
lifespan don’t have time to waste!</i></p><p>The hand atop of her head shoved once more for 
good measure before releasing her. Rei immediately broke the surface and coughed. Haruka 
then grabbed her shirt from behind and threw her several meters ahead.</p><p>“Let me tell 
you something Rei. Do you know how we knew about Venus? Michiru received a transmission from 
Venus, that Venus needed help…And do you know who it was from? It was from a royal, a 
prince.”</p><p>Something flickered in Rei’s eyes, but Haruka wasn’t about to let her rest. 
Not yet. She watched the stubborn soldier stagger up to her feet.</p><p>“Remember our 
earlier discussion? Why a God only has one child? Well, as it turns out, Minako isn’t 
actually the heir. She’s has siblings. She’s the youngest of eight! Do you know what that 
means? Well, do you...?”</p><p>Rei weakly lashed out at the woman, to which the blonde 
easily knocked her back down.</p><p>“Sloppy,” Haruka brushed off the attempt as desperate. 
It wasn’t even a contest anymore. “It means that she’s no more a Goddess than <i>you 
</i>are! But who’s real coward here? Even after she found out that you were human, did she 
hold it against you? No. She stayed with you; she accepted you for who you were! And you’re 
telling me that meant nothing to you? What about what happened on Uranus? She’s willing to 
go back and accept her punishment, fine, but who dragged her there in the first place? Even 
though she’s practically powerless, she isn’t running away. That’s more than what I can say 
about you. All you’re doing is making excuses and sulking in self-pity! That isn’t like you 
at all!”</p><p>Unknown to everyone else in the area, the aura net Rei had laid earlier began 
to re-awaken beneath them.</p><p>“SO, when you go to Venus, is that the power you’re going 
to fight with?” Rei could sense the woman approaching, and, this time, she could place a 
name to that face. “Are you going to let Minako see you like this? And what would Michiru 
say?”</p><p>“Haruka, that’s enough!” Makoto hissed. “You’re going to make 
her...”</p><p><i>...Angry. Oh!</i></p><p>Haruka watched the raven-haired woman intently from 
a short distance away. Rei hadn’t even twitched at the comment; she was simply sitting 
there, quietly. While her appearance almost begged for a ‘wet puppy’ comment from the 
blonde, she wasn’t about to push it.</p><p>In Haruka’s peripheral vision she could see Ami 
ready with another bullet if it was required. She held her hand up, asking Ami to wait a bit 
longer.</p><p>“You promised...” Rei began to stand up, “...that you wouldn’t 
tell.”</p><p><i>I am making excuses, aren’t I? She’s right; this isn’t like me at all. But 
the truth is, as much as I hate to admit it... I haven’t been the same ever since she 
stepped into my life. Minako... because of her, everything started to change. Maybe, just 
maybe...I’m a little afraid of that-- change. </i>She thought back to the kiss. <i>I still 
don’t know why she did that but, at the very least, I think... I’d rather have her in my 
life than not at all...</i></p><p><i>That much is your fault.</i></p><p>A smile came to 
Haruka’s face when the golden aura around Rei suddenly burst into crimson. The Martian threw 
out a strand of her power and snagged her sword at a distance. With that she ripped it 
straight out of the ground and back into her waiting hand.</p><p><i>Now we’re talking! 
</i>Rei’s amethyst eyes met Haruka’s green ones. There was no trace of the red haze 
anywhere.</p><p>“Hah, you can barely stand up. Do you really think you can stop 
me?”</p><p>Rei placed one foot forward and raised her sword. <i>Even if you are a Goddess 
now... </i>“Not a problem.”</p><p>Haruka was momentarily confused when Rei suddenly raised a 
hand and snapped her fingers.</p><p><b>RMM…RMM…RMM…</b></p><p>The cavern began to shake once 
again.</p><p>“N-Now what?!” Makoto was desperately trying to keep her balance but was 
finding it extremely difficult.</p><p>“Makoto, look down!” Ami warned.</p><p>“Huh?!” <i>What 
the-?!</i></p><p>Haruka held her breath when a bright crimson aura lit the floor below the 
watery surface; there were threads of Rei’s aura snaking all across the floor in a grid-like 
pattern.</p><p><i>When did that happen?!</i></p><p>“Oh, you just noticed?” Rei saw the 
woman’s head shot up. “A little <i>sloppy</i>, wouldn’t you say?” A rare smirk lit Rei’s 
lips as the threads flashed brightly, engulfing the whole room in their light.</p><p>As the 
light reached Haruka and Makoto, all the wind ruler could do was smirk back.</p><p>“It’s 
about time… you idiot!” The blonde released the restraints on her power and they clashed one 
final time.</p><p><b>WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!</b></p><p><u>(Minako, Space Shuttle)</u></p><p>Minako 
awoke when a strong vibe suddenly hit her. “Rei?” For a moment, she could have sworn that 
Rei was with her- just like the woman always was between the long flights. But this time, 
there was only her face staring back at her in the window glass.</p><p>“It must’ve been my 
imagination...” <i>That, or my mind is going. Heh. Everything seems to be slipping away from 
me these days…</i> She bit back a bitter chuckle.</p><p>On the dashboard a warning window 
popped up, indicating that she had reached Venus’s orbit. Minako reluctantly returned her 
attention to the clear window as the space craft passed into a swirl of cloud.</p><p>There 
were many things that were weighing heavily on her mind-- being away from her favorite 
teddy-bear was, sadly, amongst the largest. Ever since she met Rei, life had been a 
struggle; for an obligation to the family, her mother sent her far away—all of the 
preparation that went into the mission, the tedious, pain staking plans, she couldn’t 
imagine how much effort went to waste. And then, to top it all off, she ended up being 
dragged off to one planet after another, and was even passed off as a ‘maid’ once. She could 
almost giggled at the memory if it didn’t break her heart so; even after all of the tears, 
the self-delusions and practiced goodbye speeches- she still felt like she was never really 
ready to part ways with her. Not yet.</p><p>Minako sighed to herself and whispered, “Why do 
I still miss you?”</p><p><i>I mean, you’re loud, stubborn, short-tempered...not to mention, 
a tad bit anti-social. You’re infuriatingly difficult to deal with sometimes... But at the 
same time, you have a good heart. You really care about your friends. </i>The thought 
brought a sad smile to her face. <i>I wonder, did she ever consider me as a friend too? 
</i></p><p>Their last meeting replayed itself through her mind, reminding her of her 
bittersweet victory and defeat.</p><p><i>The times I spent with you were some of the best 
times of my life. I’m never going to forget it, ever...</i> She vowed.</p><p>The shuttle 
initiated the landing sequence and the speakers came on overhead. Minako unstrapped herself 
from the chair, and briefly felt the butterflies in her stomach flutter. Though she had put 
on a brave face back on Uranus, admittedly, she was somewhat afraid and apprehensive about 
the meeting. But she had already come this far, and had made a promise to a special 
friend.</p><p>Gathering a little courage, Minako took that first step out of the room, out 
of the shuttle, and made her way towards the palace 
grounds.</p><p><b>Tup…tup…tup…</b></p><p><u>(Cupid Palace)</u></p><p>A gust of hot air hit 
Minako’s face the instant she stepped onto fresh soil. That was strange; the grounds were 
empty. No one had come to greet her.</p><p><i>It’s just like on Mars. Mars...</i> The word 
brought back a few memories again. <i>No, I can’t. </i>She shook her head.</p><p>“I’m home.” 
She told herself.</p><p>Minako took a few steps towards the main entranceway, but she 
suddenly remembered something. After debating it silently for a minute she glanced around to 
either side, confirming that she was indeed alone, she then changed course and stepped 
around the palace towards the back.</p><p><b>Tup…tup…tup…</b></p><p>It wasn’t long before 
Minako found herself standing in front of a small gate. To either side of it, wrapped 
closely to the green fence, were tall bushes of red roses. Minako eyed them fondly for a 
moment before she slipped inside. Within the rose-lined fencing, there was a greater 
assortment of flowers within the numerous plots. The blonde obediently followed the bricked 
pathway, making her way all the way down to the far end.</p><p><i>I wonder if it’s still 
here...</i></p><p>Finding herself lost in a moment of silence, the Venusian Princess 
wandered until she found the plot and fondly exclaimed, “Aha! There it is!”</p><p>She had 
found it. Near a back corner amongst the prized flowers, there was a smaller plot. But 
compared to the flowers around it, it made for a shabby display at best; these flowers were 
still seedlings that had only begun to sprout. It would be awhile yet before they would 
reach their potential-- it happened every season. They were always the last ones to 
bloom.</p><p>“Hmm... I think they grew a little since I left.”</p><p><i>It looks like Marie 
has been taking after them while I was away.</i> The woman bent down and grazed her knuckles 
against the soft soil. Already Minako found herself becoming lost in her 
thoughts.</p><p><i>Haruka, Ami, Michiru, Makoto, and Rei… they were all heirs. I wonder what 
that must be like. My mother had eight children, me being the youngest. Eros, my only 
brother, and the oldest of us eight is the heir to my mother. I remember when I was a kid, 
he was always busy. He was always constantly training and taking lessons from 
Mother.</i></p><p><i>Eros...I…even though I’m his little sister, I hardly know him at all. 
I’ve only spoken to him once in my entire life, and it was when we first met. But from what 
I do know, he seemed so kind, strong and brave. I couldn’t think of a better person to be 
the heir. But after meeting Rei and everyone else... I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t even a 
little jealous. They all knew each other since they were little. And even if they hadn’t, 
they would still have one thing in common; they’re all going to rule their planets 
someday...</i></p><p>She shook the thought away.</p><p><i>Besides Eros, there’s Marie, the 
second eldest of us eight. None of my other sisters ever paid attention to me… but Marie 
did. I’m not really sure why she did, even now… But she seemed to care enough because 
</i>we<i> planted this garden together.</i></p><p>Minako reached out to gently touch one of 
the nearby samplings.</p><p><b>. . .</b></p><p><i>At the entranceway of the garden, a 
thirteen-year old Venus Minako innocently reached out to touch a nearby rose. Too caught up 
in her curiosity though, the girl mistakenly grasped one of the thorns with 
it.</i></p><p><i><b>Prick</b></i></p><p>“<i>Ow!” She leapt back in surprise and fell to her 
knees to stare at the small wound. There was already a trickle of blood appearing on her 
fair skin. “Ow, ow, ow, ow!”</i></p><p>“<i>Minako? Is everything all right?” A voice called 
to her. When the teenager looked up, she found herself face to face with her elder sister; 
she was a beautiful woman who appeared to be in her early twenties. Long, wavy blonde hair 
cascaded down her back, complemented by her white dress. </i></p><p><i>Marie’s gaze fell to 
the girl’s clutched hand. Instantly seeing the problem, she bent down with a concerned 
expression and began to clean the wound with material from her dress.</i></p><p>“<i>H-Hey!” 
Minako squeaked, her face immediately going red. She tried to pull her hand away but it was 
to no avail.</i></p><p>“<i>Now really, what’s wrong?” Her sister giggled at the younger 
girl’s attempts to free herself. “You’re acting like I’m a monster about to goggle you 
up.”</i></p><p>“<i>N-No! It’s not like that, really…!”</i></p><p>“<i>You know, Mother would 
disapprove if she heard you stuttering,” Marie teased.</i></p><p><i>Unsure of how to react, 
Minako could only rudely stare. She had become entranced by her sister’s long hair, how it 
moved whenever the woman laughed. She had such a warm voice. And her blue eyes, although 
Minako knew that all her siblings shared a common hair and eye color, the girl decided from 
the moment she first met Marie that her sister had the prettiest blue eyes she had ever 
seen.</i></p><p>“<i>Now, tell me... what’s the problem? What’s bothering my little sister?” 
Marie encouraged. She had just finished tending to the younger girl’s ‘injury’.</i></p><p>“… 
<i>I only met you, and I’m already making a fool of myself.” Minako bashfully admitted. She 
wasn’t sure how her sister would react to such a confession, but, for some reason, she felt 
like she could trust her.</i></p><p><i>The look in Marie’s gaze softened in understanding. 
“Oh, sweetie…Minako, this might be hard for you to accept right now, but I’d like you know 
that you have absolutely nothing to be ashamed about. Some people... just start later than 
others. You’ll get used to being out here with time...”</i></p><p>“<i>You know about that 
too?” Minako’s face flushed a crimson red. Her hands fumbled with themselves on her lap 
nervously; she never realized how easily she could be read.</i></p><p>“<i>Hmm…Taya and 
Sapphro may have mentioned it.”</i></p><p>“<i>WHAT?!” ‘How could they? My life is over!’ The 
teen thought. She never had wanted her sister to know how she felt about… 
that.</i></p><p>“<i>There, there… The past is the past Minako dear… What happened is done. 
Why don’t we focus on the present?”</i></p><p>“<i>But… what ARE we going to 
do?”</i></p><p><i>Marie held up a packet of seeds, and smiled. “I thought, perhaps... you 
would like to try gardening. So what do you say?”</i></p><p><b>. . .</b></p><p>Minako pushed 
herself up to her feet, and began to walk away from the garden.</p><p><i>Perhaps I can 
request to see Marie again before Mother punishes me. I would love to see her smile again; 
it’s just been too long since I began my lessons as a princess. There’s so much that I want 
to tell her! I’m sure she’d love to hear all about Rei and the others... all of the 
adventures we went through… But I should probably leave out the killing part or she might 
scold me for that. Come to think of it, I don’t remember if Marie ever left Venus before. 
Maybe I’ll ask when I see her.</i></p><p><b>Tup… tup… tup…</b></p><p><b>Clank, clank, 
clank</b></p><p>Minako’s ears perked up when she heard the sound of armor.</p><p><i>That 
sounds like armor...? What’s going on?</i></p><p>Immediately the sound resonated with Rei’s 
image. Minako felt her heart speed up and she ran towards the noise in 
anticipation.</p><p><b>Tup! Tup! Tup!</b></p><p>However, when she rounded the corner she 
almost ran straight into two lines of soldiers in orange armor. Venus’s symbol, which was 
painted onto their shoulder guards, was the first thing to flash in her line of 
vision.</p><p>“What?” She whispered. There were never soldiers on Venus. Their planet never 
went to battles to her knowledge. So why were some of her people dressed up in battle 
armor?</p><p>Seeming to have recognized her presence, the marching men stopped. Their 
leader, who stood at the very front, slowly turned around and met Minako’s gaze head on. He 
was a tall, handsome young man who appeared to be in his late twenties; the suit of armor 
that he wore also bore Venus’s crest, however it had a cape attached to its back and 
appeared to be an upgraded version of what the others wore. A sheathed sword was attached to 
his side. As crystal-clear blue eyes met Minako’s swirling cerulean, the younger blonde’s 
heart skipped a beat. She knew that gaze. She knew this man.</p><p>“Lord Eleutherios! Is 
something the matter Your Highness?” The soldier behind him appeared to be slightly agitated 
by the abrupt halt. In response, their leader held out his hand for silence. Then, very 
deliberately, his attention shifted back to Minako.</p><p><i>Eros…</i> Minako’s eyes 
widened.</p><p>“Minako.” Eleutherios nodded. The tone in which he said her name made his 
younger sister shiver uneasily. There was hardly any warmth in his voice-- it was hard and 
almost cold. Was this really the brother she met all those years ago?</p><p>Minako gathered 
her courage and asked, “Eros, what’s going on? Why are there people dressed up in armor? Is 
there going to be a fight?”</p><p>The man’s blue eyes flashed. “I’m afraid that is none of 
your concern. Besides, isn’t there something more important that you should be concerned 
about? Mother has been waiting for you.”</p><p>“Mother…?”</p><p>“Yes, but unfortunately 
there are some matters that we both need to attend to first. Until then, Mother has 
instructed that you should be taken to your ‘room’ until she is ready to see 
you.”</p><p>“What?!” Minako gasped, having caught the implication in his voice. A horrified 
expression plastered itself over her normally cheerful features. She couldn’t believe it. 
Was he really serious? They were going to put her back <i>there?</i></p><p><i>No! </i>Her 
mind screamed. <i>I don’t want to go back there!</i></p><p>“Why?!” She demanded. “What sort 
of matters are you both so preoccupied with?”</p><p>“...You’ve failed your mission. That is 
all I have to say to you.” Eleutherios said coolly.</p><p>Minako felt her knees go weak; 
disappointment was far worse than anger. It was true that she had failed her mission, but 
out of all the possibilities that had crossed her mind this was the one punishment that she 
never expected. Already she could feel her body trembling in anticipation. She could feel 
her heart pounding in her chest, hear it in her ears; it was growing louder and louder as 
the image of a door came to mind. It was a large door, but this time it was 
opening.</p><p>“Wait. Can I please see Marie before I go?” There was a hint of desperation 
in her voice. They would grant her that much at least, wouldn’t they?</p><p>“I’m afraid that 
is not possible...”</p><p>Minako’s heart sank. “I don’t understand. What do you mean it’s 
impossible...?” Suddenly she was afraid, more afraid than she had ever been. She was 
terrified to hear that her sister didn’t care about her anymore. She didn’t want to hear 
that Marie, too, was disappointed with her for not finishing her mission.</p><p>Eleutherios 
turned his back to his younger sister. For the first time in the conversation, there was 
some emotion in his voice.</p><p>“…Because… Marie is 
dead.”</p><p><b>DOOOOOOM!</b></p><p>Minako’s mind instantly went blank.</p><p>“You there,” 
Venus’s heir pointed out a nearby soldier.</p><p>“Yes Sir!”</p><p>“Take Lady Minako to her 
room. After you’re done, catch up with us.”</p><p>“Sir!”</p><p>Minako felt numb, never 
noticing the man’s strong arms steadying her against his side. She didn’t realize she was 
being led away to that place--she suddenly didn’t care.</p><p>…Marie… was dead.</p>
