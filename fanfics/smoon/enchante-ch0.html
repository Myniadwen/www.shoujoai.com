<h1>Enchante (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Women find me irresistible. I realize it sounds arrogant, but it is 
the truth. I have known this since I was thirteen (not that many years 
ago, true, but long enough, now) when I entered my middle school for 
the first time in a boy&#146;s uniform. I made no new enemies that day, and 
many new admirers. From that day onward the girls followed me, asking 
to sit with me, share my notes, and all the little sillinesses that 
girls do. The boys knew me well enough, knew I could back my 
appearance with a competence few of them had, and they accepted me, 
reluctantly. A few boys, braver than most, or yaoi and scared, tried 
to proposition me.

I knew it when my history teacher&#146;s assistant, Yuri-sempai, found any 
reason she could to touch me. A hand on a shoulder or on my own hand, 
even a ruffle of my short hair. Each touch, each caress, left behind 
the scent of the flower she was named for, in my nose and on my skin. 
I was young, yes, but so was she, barely out of school, in her first 
job. I have always been tall, even for a man, and by fourteen I 
already had reached nearly my full height. Yuri-sempai looked younger 
than her years, petite, with long dark hair and large, dark eyes. And 
those eyes spoke volumes. In her arms I learned about women&#146;s bodies, 
what they are capable of, and in between her legs I learned about 
desire. I learned those lessons well.

The girls did not stop flirting with me. In fact, they tried harder. 
It wasn&#146;t hard to win me over, gain a little of my attention. The flip 
of hair, the twirl of a skirt - by fourteen, girls know the power of 
these things. 

Don&#146;t get me wrong - I have no illusions as to why they came to me. In 
me they saw the strength and firmness of a man, but they all knew that 
underneath was a woman, as soft and vulnerable as they. They came to 
me, but it wasn&#146;t always my name they cried out in orgasm. Sometimes 
it was their boyfriends&#146;, sometimes another boy&#146;s or girl&#146;s. I was the 
embodiment of everything they wanted, tempered by the familiarity of 
everything they knew.

And then I met Michiru. She brought me to a crashing halt - the same 
way I had seen others react to me. This isn&#146;t the place to recount all 
that we went through, but I will say that when Michiru and I first 
made love, I immediately forgot that I had ever loved anyone else. She 
was everything to me. 

But still the girls followed me, wanting attention and love. By then 
my heart belonged to Michiru completely and it became a game, me 
flirting with the girls, she with the boys. We were the heartbreakers 
of Mugen Gakuen.

She teased me about it, of course. She teased me incessantly, about 
the boys who challenged me over their girlfriend&#146;s honor and the girls 
who followed me home. When we met Minako and Usagi at the Crown, she 
teased me about them, too. I was used to it and teased right back.

Some time later, we sat at a tea shop - not the Crown Fruit parlor, we 
had taken a ride down the coast. A small, intimate place ,and we were 
the sole customers. The proprietor had retired to the back and we were 
alone. Her eyes twinkled as she put down her cup and a smirk just 
touched the corners of her lips. We were talking about Usagi and her 
friends and Michiru began to giggle.

&quot;So?&quot; she asked, amused. &quot;Which one will be first?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; I was scandalized, if she was being serious. &quot;What do you 
mean?&quot;

&quot;You know perfectly well what I mean. Those girls, well at least two 
of them, have fallen hard for you, Haruka, and you know it.&quot;

I stared into my cup and drank silently. I knew it, but it was 
irrelevant. 

Michiru, I swear, could read my thoughts. &quot;It&#39;s not irrelevant. 
They&#146;re sweet girls and they like you - alot.&quot; I said nothing. What 
could I say?

&quot;I think it will be Minako-chan.&quot; Michiru commented lightly, her eyes 
mischievous. That brought me up short.

&quot;Minako? I would think it would be Makoto...&quot; I tapered off as I saw 
the triumph in her face.

&quot;Makoto is too shy and sweet, but Minako...take my word, there is 
steel in that girl.&quot; Michiru laughed as my face fell, defeated.

I had one card up my sleeve and I played it. &quot;And how long before Ami 
comes to you?&quot; The look on her face was precious, and I savored it for 
a moment.

She pulled a strand of hair back behind her ears - clearly meant to 
distract me, and it worked. I watched her long fingers and caught the 
look in her eye and smiled. It really was irrelevant, I thought, but 
now I wondered....
