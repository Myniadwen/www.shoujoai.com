<h1>Partners in Crime</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;All right,&quot; Sailor V murmured as the masked blonde finished cutting the 
electrical lines, &quot;the alarm is off.&quot; Minako Aino carefully kept her red 
skirt from flying up as she crouched on the roof beside her partner, 
&quot;Ready to go.&quot;

Hotaru Tomoe nodded seriously as the black haired younger woman eased 
the window open, then slid inside while carefully keeping her dark 
purple dress from catching on the edges. &quot;I see the target,&quot; she 
murmured as she used the cable to slowly descend.

&quot;Look out for the...&quot; Minako started.

BAWOOGA! BAWOOGA!

&quot;...security lasers,&quot; Minako sighed.

&quot;You couldn&#39;t tell me about them a little sooner?&quot; Hotaru yelped as she 
gave up on sneaking in and rapidly dropped onto the waiting display 
case. Disregarding the plan to cut it open she smashed it with her 
gloved fist, snatching at diamonds and emeralds, tucking them into the 
pouch at her side before tying it shut.

&quot;I thought I did,&quot; Minako protested as she bodily hauled Hotaru back up.

&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so, I&#39;d have remembered,&quot; Hotaru said as she climbed 
out of the window to crouch on the rooftop. Off in the distance they 
heard the first sirens wailing as the police rushed across town, &quot;So, 
what now?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll distract the cops,&quot; Minako said, &quot;you head home.&quot;

&quot;Be careful,&quot; Hotaru leaned forward, the younger woman kissing her 
gently.

&quot;Always.&quot; Minako smiled, watching her lover scramble away across the 
rooftops, soon disappearing into the night.

Police cars squealed up to the building as a tall, brown haired police 
woman emerged holding a megaphone. &quot;We know you&#39;re in these,&quot; Natsuna 
Sakurada called, &quot;come out with your hands up!&quot;

&quot;Fear not,&quot; Sailor V boldly declared from a nearby rooftop, the light 
shining on her hair as she struck a heroic pose, &quot;I will catch the evil 
doer!&quot;

&quot;Oh Sailor V-sama!&quot; Natsuna squealed like a true fan-girl.

&quot;Uh, inspector,&quot; her compatriot murmured, &quot;we should really be doing a 
search ourselves...&quot;

&quot;Hush,&quot; Natsuna turned on him angrily, &quot;Sailor V will catch the 
villain.&quot;

&quot;Hup!&quot; Sailor V leapt, not incidentally giving everyone a great view up 
her skirt.

&quot;Ah!&quot; Natsuna nose bled then she fainted.

&quot;Chief!&quot; a young woman cried out in alarm.

&quot;I will return with the criminal,&quot; Sailor V called out to them 
dramatically as she bounded away, hiding a impish smile.

Nearly a hour later Minako Aino returned to the townhouse, unlocking the 
front door even as she called, &quot;Hotaru, are you home?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Hotaru called from the living room.

Taking off her stylish overcoat Minako looked like a model as she strode 
down the hall, the white blouse and red skirt she wore looking elegant 
and sexy. Hotaru was sitting at the kitchen table, a jeweler&#39;s eyeglass 
on as she examined a jewel, the rest of them sitting on a black velvet 
bag.

&quot;Any problems?&quot; Minako asked as she walked over to Hotaru&#39;s side, 
leaning forward to plant a kiss on her cheek.

Hotaru took off the eyeglass and smiled, stretching out in her 
sweatshirt and shorts. &quot;No problems,&quot; she said, &quot;and I took the long way 
around, just in case.&quot;

&quot;So how&#39;s the haul look?&quot; Minako asked curiously as she sat down on a 
chair beside Hotaru, looking at the gleaming stones curiously.

&quot;If we could sell them legally we&#39;d have about a hundred thousand or 
so,&quot; Hotaru said, &quot;but I figure the fence will only give us fifty.&quot;

&quot;Bastard,&quot; Minako sighed. She gave Hotaru a look, &quot;Guess it&#39;d be too 
risky if Sailor V claimed to have found them and got a reward?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve pulled that before,&quot; Hotaru shook her head, &quot;too often and people 
are going to start asking why you could recover the gems without 
catching me.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Minako sighed. She paused then laughed softly as she murmured, 
&quot;You&#39;re a corrupting influence, m&#39;love.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all for a good cause,&quot; Hotaru reached out to squeeze Minako&#39;s 
hand, &quot;robbing from my father, the biggest crime lord in the city.&quot;

&quot;He certainly deserves it,&quot; Minako agreed.

&quot;I still find it hard to believe,&quot; Hotaru said softly as she looked up 
to meet Minako&#39;s eyes, &quot;how this crazy partnership began.&quot;

&quot;It is unlikely,&quot; Minako agreed.

It had begum for Sailor V when she had been investigating a new designer 
drug called &quot;Heart Crystal&quot; which had been flooding Tokyo. While the 
heroine had been successful in busting a few labs and dealers, the 
source of the drug seemed to elude her. It wasn&#39;t until a mysterious 
woman contacted her that she discovered the truth... that the city&#39;s 
most respected medical company, Infinity, was really responsible for the 
illegal drug trade. And even more startling was that her source was the 
company president&#39;s daughter, Hotaru!

Together they pooled their information, not only getting a understanding 
of the scope of his crimes but also how well he had shielded himself. 
Only his most executive assistants knew anything about his crimes, and 
they were the ones who dealt with the crime side. There was almost 
nothing directly linking Professor Tomoe to anything his people had 
done.

After some attempts by Sailor V to get lower end soldiers to talk, they 
both had to accept that until they could nail one of Tomoe&#39;s core five 
lieutenants, they couldn&#39;t touch him. HOWEVER, they could hit Tomoe 
where it hurt... in the pocket book. Taking advantage of both of their 
athletic skills they began to strike at obvious signs of Tomoe&#39;s wealth, 
stealing from him and donating most of the profits to the poor.

&quot;I&#39;m glad we became partners, though,&quot; Hotaru got up, the twenty 
something stretching gracefully, &quot;and not just because of the crime 
fighting.&quot;

Minako gulped, seeing the sweatshirt tighten over the swell of Hotaru&#39;s 
breasts. &quot;Are you tired?&quot; she asked softly, her voice dropping a bit.

Hotaru smiled, her eyes twinkling a bit. &quot;Not really,&quot; she sauntered 
over to Minako&#39;s side, &quot;why, what do you have in mind?&quot;

Minako smiled, reaching out to gently pull Hotaru closer as she pulled 
up the bottom of the sweatshirt to kiss her belly. &quot;I think you know,&quot; 
she said, seeing Hotaru shiver from the feeling of Minako&#39;s breath on 
her pale skin.

&quot;Oooh, Mina,&quot; Hotaru gasped softly. She reached down and pulled on 
Minako&#39;s shoulders to make her stand. &quot;You are such a bad girl.&quot;

Minako rose gracefully, pulling the smaller women close as she looked 
down at her with eyes heavy with desire. &quot;Just as bad as you want me to 
be,&quot; Minako answered, pushing Hotaru&#39;s short hair back before giving her 
a kiss.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Hotaru leaned in, her hands running over Minako&#39;s back, pulling 
her blouse up then stroking at bare skin.

&quot;Cold fingers,&quot; Minako nearly jumped.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Hotaru kissed the side of her neck then began to nibble 
as she told Minako, &quot;they&#39;ll get warm soon enough.&quot;

&quot;Deffinately a corrupting influence,&quot; Minako murmured as Hotaru&#39;s lips 
moved down towards her cloth covered breasts.

&quot;You haven&#39;t seen anything yet...&quot; Hotaru smirked.

later that night

&quot;Where did you get THAT?&quot;

&quot;A little shop downtown. Like it?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s so BIG!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, with the proper preperation it&#39;ll slide right in...&quot;

&quot;Hotaru, I hate to break it to you but I&#39;m a virgin...&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;d be honored to take that, m&#39;love. All right?&quot;

&quot;Be gentle.&quot;</pre>
