<h1>Power Transcendent (part 14 of 31)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jessica.html">Jessica</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/powertrans-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>The Sailor Senshi were momentarily stunned, first by Muon&#39;s sudden 
appearance, then by Gluon&#39;s outburst and subsequent action. Sailor 
Neptune was the first to recover, and she did not look happy. She turned 
not to either of the enemies, however, nor to the black objects embedded 
in the concrete. She turned directly to Sailor Moon. 

&quot;What,&quot; she asked in a deceptively mild tone of voice, &quot;is she doing 
here?&quot; She pointed at Sailor Saturn, who had backed up towards Sailor 
Chibi-Moon. &quot;I thought we all agreed to keep her out of trouble.&quot;

&quot;Um...&quot; Sailor Moon smiled awkwardly. &quot;She...wanted to come?&quot;

&quot;She wanted to come.&quot; The whining from the Tears embedded in the 
concrete became louder. Neptune turned to them, along with the rest of 
the Senshi, but not before giving Sailor Moon a look that clearly said 
the subject was not closed. Sailor Moon looked less than pleased.
 
Sailor Uranus, in the meantime, had placed herself between Muon and 
Sailor Saturn, holding the younger Senshi behind her protectively and 
giving the blue-clad man a hard glare. &quot;Not very popular, are you?&quot; She 
spat, glancing up at the still laughing Gluon. 

&quot;It would seem not.&quot; Muon said, looking at his creations with a kind of 
dead-eyed curiosity. The green lightning that crackled around the 
exposed hemispheres cut out abruptly, and at the same instant, the 
concrete floor of the courtyard changed to match the texture of the 
Tears, becoming smooth, black and reflective. 

&quot;What...what&#39;s happening?&quot; Jupiter asked, looking from one side to the 
other. 

&quot;Gluon has used his power to bond my creations with the ground of this 
area.&quot; Muon answered. &quot;I admit, I had not anticipated his gaining this 
level of control over my weapons.&quot;

&quot;You created those things?&quot; Sailor Mars said, aghast. &quot;Well, stop them!&quot; 
She looked up at Gluon, who was grinning down on all of them, as if 
waiting to see what they would do next. &quot;I think he&#39;s going to kill you, 
too.&quot;

&quot;I cannot.&quot; Muon said nothing else, continuing to observe with a notable 
lack of enthusiasm. 

In a far corner of the courtyard, Mercury had managed to help Sailor 
Venus find relative shelter behind a pile of broken chairs and tables. 
Venus&#39;s face was tight and strained, and sweat had broken on her 
forehead. She had managed to avoid any hits from the Tears, but with the 
stress of moving to avoid them, Mercury was afraid she had damaged her 
healing ribs again. 

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Venus said with a small smile. &quot;But I&#39;m afraid we might have 
just wasted our time...it doesn&#39;t look like those things will be flying 
around much more.&quot; 

Mercury smiled back. &quot;I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re here...you&#39;ll be safe.&quot; She 
placed her gloved hand on the altered ground and rubbed the new surface. 
&quot;How bizarre...&quot; She murmured. Venus laughed weakly.

&quot;Oh, come on. It&#39;s not that weird.&quot; She crossed her legs and sat up. 
&quot;What do you have?&quot; 
 
Mercury&#39;s visor came on again, and Venus could see the flashes and 
fragments of light that raced across it. Mercury winced and quickly shut 
it off. &quot;I don&#39;t know! There&#39;s too much for the computer to analyze.&quot;

They looked back out to the center of the courtyard where the other 
Senshi and Muon still stood. Uranus looked furious. &quot;Well if you can&#39;t 
do something, I will.&quot; She stepped forward, glaring up at Gluon. &quot;SPACE 
SWORD BLASTER!&quot; The curved energy sword spun out towards the roof of the 
shop, but hit an invisible barrier as it left the boundary of the 
courtyard, and vanished. &quot;What the...&quot;

An eyeblink later, a pillar of yellow energy erupted from the ground 
directly beneath Uranus. Her body became rigid as the energy rushed over 
her, leaving her unable even to scream. &quot;Uranus!&quot; Neptune cried out. The 
Senshi of the Sea ran to her lover and heedlessly grabbed her arm, 
pulling her with all her might. Neptune threw her head back and screamed 
in pain, but did not loosen her grip. 

At first, her attempt seemed futile. Mars ran forward, tears in her 
eyes, ready to try to pull Neptune away. But just as she reached the two 
Outer Senshi, there was a massive detonation of green and yellow, and 
the pillar vanished, Uranus and Neptune spinning away to rest on the 
ground, unmoving, fukus singed and smoking. 

Jupiter knelt by the two of them, looking worried. Mars ran up, 
panicked, Sailor Moon and Mercury running just a few steps behind. &quot;Are 
they...&quot;

With a small, comforting smile, Jupiter shook her head. &quot;They&#39;ll be 
fine...they&#39;ll be out for awhile, though.&quot;

Gluon was smirking. &quot;Too easy...I can&#39;t believe how easy this is!&quot; He 
laughed, but got himself under control before he lost it again. &quot;There&#39;s 
no way out of the field I&#39;ve created...every single attack you launch 
will come back at you. And that goes for you as well, Muon.&quot; He grinned 
at Muon, waiting to see how he would react. 

Muon, however, just looked at him with the same blank expression. 
&quot;Obviously.&quot; He finally said, turning his back on Gluon, his cobalt 
robes swirling around him. Gluon was livid. 

&quot;I swear, Muon...before I kill you, I *will* hear you scream.&quot; He raised 
his arms again, and the green lightning began to crackle from the 
embedded Tears, spreading along the ground and forming a honeycomb 
pattern. A sudden flash of red appeared, washing over Gluon and forcing 
him to form a green barrier around himself. The pattern in the courtyard 
below faded out. 

&quot;I told you, Gluon.&quot; Sailor Pluto had leapt from a neighboring roof and 
was rising from a crouch in front of him. &quot;Your tricks are useless 
against me.&quot; 

Gluon lowered his arms from their defensive position, a wide-eyed smile 
on his face. &quot;And you are a fool for thinking I wouldn&#39;t have new 
tricks, Sailor Pluto!&quot; With a loud cry, he slammed his fists together. 
Pluto was already rushing towards him, energy flashing around her Garnet 
Orb as she moved to attack. As the Rod swung downward, Gluon reached up 
and caught it on his wrist. 

There was a violent concussion and red and green energy flew all across 
the roof. Pluto looked shocked, and Gluon just smirked. &quot;You see? New 
trick.&quot; Pluto looked confused, and then her eyes widened in 
understanding. The garnet energy flying from her Rod hadn&#39;t stopped, and 
was now flowing towards the invisible barrier around the courtyard. 

Pluto straightened and turned away, but it was too late. The barrier 
became visible for a moment, a pulsing field of darkness surrounding the 
courtyard, swelling up where Pluto&#39;s energy collided with it. The 
darkness reached outward and absorbed Pluto into it, yanking her 
backward with a loud exclamation and holding her immobile and limp in 
the air above the courtyard. 

The Senshi below all cried out as they saw Pluto disabled. Saturn was 
the worst hit of all, and would have run headlong into the barrier if 
Chibi-Moon hadn&#39;t pulled her back. &quot;Setsuna-mama!&quot; She screamed. 
&quot;Setsuna-mama!&quot; 

&quot;Why don&#39;t you save her?&quot; Muon asked, stepping forward. Saturn and 
Chibi-Moon turned to him. Chibi-Moon glared at him furiously, and opened 
her mouth to yell, but Saturn put a hand on her shoulder. 

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; She asked. 

&quot;None of my creations, no matter how Gluon had altered them, have the 
capacity to resist the energy I know you possess.&quot; For the first time, 
there was a hint of eagerness in his voice, and his eyes were glowing 
very softly. &quot;Show me.&quot;

Sailor Saturn stared at him, and for a moment, her eyes dulled, her 
voice sliding again into that of her other, ancient persona. &quot;So...I 
see.&quot; Her eyes brightened again, and she shook her head, as if to clear 
it. She bit her lip and looked down. &quot;I...can&#39;t.&quot; She gripped the haft 
of her Silence Glaive tightly, her shoulders quivering. &quot;What you&#39;re 
asking...is impossible.&quot; Chibi-Moon stood in front of her, and Saturn 
gratefully leaned on her, giving her a one armed hug. 

Chibi-Moon glared at Muon, but he didn&#39;t even register her presence. He 
continued to stare at Saturn, measuring her carefully. &quot;I understand.&quot; 
He finally said. &quot;Disappointing.&quot; He turned his gaze back up to the 
rooftop, where Gluon still stood, gloating. 

A rose flew by Gluon&#39;s cheek, and he frowned suddenly, spinning around. 
The rose flew into the barrier and disintegrated. On the opposite side 
of the roof, Tuxedo Kamen stood there, his cape draped over him. &quot;You.&quot; 
Gluon said, his eyes narrowing. &quot;Who are you?&quot; 
 
&quot;Tuxedo Kamen.&quot; Was the soft reply. He threw his cape back, brandishing 
his cane. &quot;Release them. Now!&quot; 

&quot;Do you really expect me to?&quot; Gluon said, smirking. He clenched his 
fists and green energy once again swirled over them. 

&quot;No.&quot; Tuxedo Kamen twirled the cane around and rushed Gluon. His cane 
rebounded off the emerald aura around Gluon&#39;s fist, but he jumped 
backwards before the counterstrike. He threw another rose, and Gluon 
just managed to move his hand to deflect it. Without pause, he rushed 
forward, forcing Tuxedo Kamen to backflip out of the path of the attack. 

From her sitting position, Sailor Venus had watched everything that had 
happened. She looked up at where Tuxedo Kamen and Gluon were fighting 
furiously to the cheers of Sailor Moon and Chibi-Moon. Then she looked 
at Sailor Pluto, still unconscious and limp in the air, and down at 
Uranus and Neptune, who were just beginning to stir. Finally, her gaze 
fell on the five Death&#39;s Tears, still embedded into the transformed 
ground. 

She yanked herself to her feet, ignoring the flashes of pain from her 
fiercely protesting ribs. She joined the other Senshi, who turned to 
look at her. &quot;Venus!&quot; Mercury exclaimed, running to meet her. Venus 
smiled in return. 

&quot;Okay guys, it&#39;s time to stop playing around. I have an idea.&quot; She 
looked at Chibi-Moon. &quot;You look after Saturn...and yourself.&quot; Venus 
glanced at Muon. &quot;I don&#39;t trust him. The rest of you, it&#39;s time.&quot; She 
held her hands out. The two youngest Senshi ran for shelter in the 
debris Venus had just vacated. 

Mercury took Venus&#39; right hand, and Sailor Moon took her right. Then 
Mark joined hands with Sailor Moon and Jupiter completed the circle. 
&quot;Okay...we need to do this fast.&quot; Venus said. &quot;Tuxedo Kamen can&#39;t hold 
out much longer, and I don&#39;t think we can do this if Gluon has a chance 
to concentrate.&quot; 
 
&quot;So let&#39;s go all out.&quot; Jupiter smiled confidently. &quot;No problem.&quot;

All five of the warriors closed their eyes and concentrated. Each began 
to glow from within, surrounded by the light of their power. A pillar of 
identical color flew up from beneath each one, and they all staggered a 
bit, but held firm. &quot;Now!&quot; Venus cried out. As one, the Inner Senshi 
called out.  
 
&quot;SAILOR PLANET ATTACK!&quot; The pillars were lost in the blazing white 
sphere of energy that sprang from the Sailor Senshi. It expanded, 
throwing back the barrier of energy that surrounded the courtyard. 

&quot;NO!&quot; Gluon screamed, looking towards them. He pressed his fists 
together and slammed them into the floor beneath him, cracking the 
surface and creating a massive green explosion that sent Tuxedo Kamen 
skidding across the roof. But it was too late. When the light cleared, 
the concrete floor of the courtyard was returned to normal, and the 
Death&#39;s Tears lay on their sides, rolling gently across the ground. 

Sailor Pluto remained suspended in the air for a moment, then started to 
fall. Fortunately, before she hit the ground, Neptune and Uranus both 
caught her, having been awoken by the light and fury of the attack. The 
five Inner Senshi slumped to the ground, exhausted. Tuxedo Kamen leapt 
to the ground to aid them. Muon had watched the attack with a complete 
lack of interest, and now turned his face towards Gluon. 

Gluon&#39;s face was contorted with rage. His shoulders shook, and he opened 
his mouth, but no sound came out. Finally, he threw his head back and 
screamed in rage. The Tears sprang into the air again, flying around and 
ripping deep gouges in the concrete where the points made contact.

&quot;Enough!&quot; Muon said, raising his voice to be heard over the traitorous 
Gluon. &quot;Nothing can be gained by continuing this. End it.&quot; A silver 
shadow slid up the side of the shop. Gluon took no notice, continuing to 
shriek in anger. His scream cut off sharply when a silver point suddenly 
appeared in the center of his chest. He looked down at it with a 
complete lack of understanding. 

Gluon looked behind him. There stood Gylax, her arm extended into a 
point that she had stabbed right through his back and out the other 
side. &quot;Gylax...?&quot; He gasped, falling to his knees. &quot;Why?&quot; 
 
&quot;A better offer, Gluon.&quot; She said, a smirk in her hollow voice. 
&quot;Now...farewell.&quot; She raised her other arm and it also flew into a 
needle like point, this one stabbing right through his neck. Below, the 
Sailor Senshi all turned their heads from the gruesome sight. There was 
a final, gurgling sigh, and Gluon collapsed into the ground. 

Everyone stared, first at the silvery daeva who stood atop the now 
fairly battle-worn tea shop, and then back at Muon. &quot;Now.&quot; Muon said 
softly. The Death&#39;s Tears wobbled for a moment, flashing green for a 
moment. Then an azure glow swept them, and they snapped to attention. 
&quot;Now, Sailor Saturn. You may not be what I thought, but I will still 
have you. Come to me.&quot; 
 
&quot;No!&quot; Uranus shouted, pulling Saturn behind her. She pulled herself 
shakily to her feet. Muon simply raised an eyebrow. 

&quot;Don&#39;t be foolish. None of you have to power to oppose me now.&quot; 

&quot;Shut up!&quot; Uranus retorted. &quot;You&#39;ll have to kill me if you want her.&quot; 
Neptune and Pluto also pulled themselves up, forming a wall between Muon 
and his quarry. 

&quot;So be it.&quot; The Tears all spun around until their points were leveled at 
the Outer Senshi. It sounded like Saturn was struggling, but Uranus was 
finding the strength to hold her. 

&quot;Not...so fast.&quot; Sailor Moon had also pulled herself to her feet. She 
glared at Muon. &quot;Why do you want her?&quot; 
 
Muon turned to look at the furious Moon Princess. &quot;I wish to study her.&quot; 
One of the black Tears turned its point towards her. &quot;Do not try to 
thwart me.&quot; 
 
Sailor Moon took several deep breaths. With each breath, she seemed to 
gain strength. &quot;You&#39;re not taking her. You&#39;re not hurting anyone else. 
You&#39;re leaving. *Now.*&quot; Tuxedo Kamen stepped behind her and placed a 
supporting hand on her shoulder, and Sailor Moon smiled back at him. She 
revealed her scepter, and twirled it in her hand. A light pink glow 
seemed to suffuse her. 

&quot;MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!&quot; The attack sped out, building on itself and 
splitting into five twisting coils of pink energy. Each one hit a Tear, 
and each Tear burst into pink light. They held firm, however, and began 
to build up their own energy for a counter attack. Sailor Moon cried 
out, her pigtails flying out straight behind her from the energy pouring 
from her body. With one final, massive detonation the Death&#39;s Tears 
exploded, black fragments flying high into the air. 

Muon looked irritated for a moment. He turned fully to Sailor Moon, blue 
lightning crackling around his hand as he reached for his saber. Then he 
stopped. The Sailor Senshi had all stood up now. They were weary and 
damaged, but each warrior bore a look of fierce determination. &quot;Leave.&quot; 
Uranus said behind him, smiling. &quot;Now.&quot; 
 
&quot;Hmm...Sailor Moon.&quot; The light faded, and his hand slipped from his 
hilt. &quot;I see...Sailor Senshi, the ancient guardians of the Silver 
Millennium. Now I understand...it seems once again I have been guilty of 
underestimating you.&quot; He lifted his hand, and a portal appeared behind 
him. &quot;It will not happen again. Gylax.&quot; He stepped backwards through the 
portal. Gylax leapt from the roof, collapsing into a puddle that 
slithered across the ground with blinding speed into the vortex. The 
portal closed, and there was a moment of utter silence. 

Uranus drew Saturn around to her front, lightly resting her hands on the 
Senshi of Silence&#39;s shoulders. She closed her eyes, a lopsided smile on 
her face. &quot;Well, I guess we won.&quot; 

With that, cheers broke out from the gathered Senshi. Uranus and Neptune 
embraced closely, and Saturn ran to Pluto, who knelt to embrace her. 
They were joined a moment later by Chibi-Moon, almost falling over when 
the pink-haired tornado flung herself onto Saturn&#39;s back.

Meanwhile, Tuxedo Kamen looked on, smiling as the Inner Senshi 
exuberantly hugged one another in victory. Sailor Moon popped up from 
the crowd and waved towards the Outer Senshi. &quot;Hey guys! Come join us!&quot; 
 
Neptune looked back at Sailor Moon with a sugary-sweet smile. &quot;Just 
remember, Your Highness...we still have to discuss exactly what Sailor 
Saturn was doing here.&quot; Though her voice was bright and cheery, there 
was an unmistakable threat in her voice. 

Sailor Moon cringed a little, her arm still half-extended, her smile 
growing somewhat shaky. She spun around in place and dashed through her 
bodyguard as quickly as possible. &quot;Tuxedo Kamen! I didn&#39;t see you 
there!&quot; 

Sailor Venus had been sticking to the outskirts of the knot of Sailor 
Senshi, not wanting to aggravate her poor, much-abused ribs anymore than 
necessary at this point. Like her companions, she was nearly bowled over 
by Sailor Moon&#39;s hasty retreat. She spun around completely once, and 
reached out blindly for something to support her. Her palm hit something 
warm and smooth, and looked up to find her hand resting directly on the 
brooch in the center of Sailor Mercury&#39;s bow. 

She yanked her hand away, both girls blushing like maniacs. She grinned 
randomly at Mercury. &quot;Um...thanks for...um...breaking my fall.&quot;

&quot;Oh...yes! Erm...any...anytime...&quot; The two Senshi stood there, smiling 
at each other goofily. Finally, Venus had enough and threw her arms 
around Ami&#39;s neck, pulling her close. Mercury gently slid her arms 
around her waist in return.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re okay.&quot; Venus whispered, closing her eyes. 

Mercury smiled and leaned her head against Venus&#39;s. &quot;Me too...&quot; She 
paused. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean it like that...well, I mean I&#39;m glad I&#39;m okay, of 
course...but I&#39;m really glad you&#39;re okay...&quot; Her cheeks became pinker 
and pinker as she spoke, and finally she decided to just shut up. 

Venus pulled back from Mercury enough to look her in the face, grinning. 
Mercury just blushed more and awkwardly turned her eyes to the ground. 
&quot;Hey, it&#39;s okay...I knew what you meant.&quot; 
 
Mercury looked back up, her cheeks still flushed. &quot;Thanks...&quot; They 
continued looking at each other for a long, still moment. The loud, 
celebratory noises seemed to fade away as the atmosphere around them 
changed, becoming charged and heavy. Mercury&#39;s eyes half-closed, and she 
leaned her head in slowly.

Sailor Venus began to tremble slightly. Her mind was buzzing with equal 
amounts of alarm and excitement, but she didn&#39;t pull back. In fact, as 
she watched Mercury&#39;s face approach her, she leaned in as well, her lips 
parted slightly. 

As with many such moments, this one died a quick and ignoble death. 
Jupiter and Mars ran over and hugged Venus and Mercury from behind 
respectively. &quot;Hey guys!&quot; Jupiter called out enthusiastically. &quot;We&#39;re 
getting out of here before the cops finally get their courage up. Let&#39;s 
go.&quot; 
 
-*KILL!*- Venus turned with her fists clenched, but managed to restrain 
her more murderous impulses and be drawn out of the courtyard along with 
the rest of the Senshi. As she left, she couldn&#39;t help but appreciate 
the irony of being torn away from Mercury by the two girls who seemed to 
be bent on setting Venus up with her. 

-------------------

Once well away from the poor teashop and transformed, the Sailor Senshi 
were exhausted. Worst hit was Usagi, who was literally falling asleep on 
her feet. Setsuna and Haruka were little better. Mamoru agreed to drive 
Usagi, Setsuna Chibi-Usa and Hotaru home. Haruka seemed dead-set on 
riding her motorcycle home, but Michiru finally informed her that if she 
insisted on driving, not only would she be riding home alone, she&#39;d be 
sleeping alone too. So with a large amount of grumbling, Haruka climbed 
up behind Michiru, who headed home at a more conservative speed that 
Haruka probably appreciated. 

&quot;I didn&#39;t know she could drive that thing.&quot; Makoto noted, watching the 
bike&#39;s taillights vanishing down the streets of Tokyo. 

&quot;I&#39;m not surprised.&quot; Rei said with a small smile. Makoto gave her a look 
out of the corner of her eye, then smiled as well. &quot;Well,&quot; Rei 
continued, looking at the other three girls. &quot;What&#39;s the plan now? We 
could all head to the Shrine...&quot;

Ami yawned. &quot;Actually, I think I&#39;m just going to head home. I need some 
sleep.&quot;  
 
Minako had her hand half-raised, planning on supporting Rei&#39;s plan. But 
on hearing Ami speak, she managed to make her movement look like a 
stretch. She yawned as well. &quot;Yeah...um...I&#39;m pretty wiped out too.&quot; She 
smiled brightly. &quot;We did great tonight, Senshi. You should all be proud. 
I know I am.&quot;

Ami smiled, first at Minako, then at the others. &quot;Thanks, Mina-chan. 
Well...good night!&quot; She headed off down the street. After giving Rei and 
Makoto another hug, Minako left as well, taking a different street that 
headed to her home. 

Makoto and Rei looked at each other for a long moment, then broke out 
laughing. &quot;How long do you think it will take those two to run into each 
other?&quot; Makoto asked, wiping her eyes.

&quot;Maybe about two minutes.&quot; Rei said, chuckling. She smiled. &quot;I hope 
they&#39;re doing alright...they really are sweet together.&quot; 
 
&quot;Yeah, they are.&quot; Makoto nodded. She smiled over at Rei. &quot;I saw what you 
were going to do, by the way. You were going to try to pull Michiru 
away. That was really brave of you.&quot;

Rei blushed, then laughed. &quot;Well...yeah.&quot; She stuck her tongue out at 
the brunette. &quot;Jeez, when did you get so observant?&quot; 

Makoto shrugged. &quot;Who knows?&quot; She smiled. &quot;Well, it&#39;s just me, but is 
the invitation still open? You have that new OVA I&#39;ve been wanting to 
see...and I&#39;ll whip us up a little snack.&quot;

&quot;Of course!&quot; Rei grinned. &quot;I watched it with Usagi already...but it&#39;ll 
be nice to hear it without the shrieking.&quot; Laughing, the two girls 
turned their feet towards the Hikawa Shrine.

-------------------

Minako had passed several streets before she realized her ribs were not 
hurting as she would have expected. They were aching a bit, sure...but 
really, they hurt less now than they did that morning. She turned a 
corner, trying to puzzle that out, and almost ran directly into Ami, who 
had been turning that same corner. 
 
Ami took several steps back to avoid colliding with Minako, smiling as 
she. &quot;Oh! Mina-chan! I was just looking for you...are you okay?&quot; 
 
Minako grinned. &quot;Oh sure...I was just looking for you, too.&quot; She rocked 
back on her heels, her hands behind her back. &quot;So...what&#39;s up?&quot; 

&quot;Well...I guess I was just worried...I realized you were walking back, 
and your ribs...&quot; 
 
&quot;Yeah...but they don&#39;t really hurt that badly anymore.&quot; She shrugged. 
&quot;Go figure.&quot; 

Ami blinked. &quot;That&#39;s...hm...&quot; She thought for a moment, cupping her hand 
over her mouth. &quot;I think I may understand. Our power is what makes us 
heal quickly. When we perform the Planet Attack, we channel our power 
directly through our bodies.&quot; 
 
&quot;So doing that made my ribs heal faster?&quot; Minako chuckled. &quot;Well, I 
guess I&#39;m glad, but it seems like a pretty complicated way to get 
better.&quot;

Ami chuckled as well. She looked like there was something else she 
wanted to say, and Minako gave her time to speak. &quot;That wasn&#39;t the only 
thing I was worried about, Mina-chan.&quot; She finally said. Minako tilted 
her head quizzically.  
 
&quot;Ami-chan?&quot; 
 
Ami looked down at the sidewalk. Around them, the lights of Tokyo were 
turning on in response to the falling evening. A breeze picked up around 
them, cold and smelling of winter. &quot;I wanted to know if you wanted to 
stay with me tonight.&quot; She said in a small voice. &quot;I was 
worried...because I didn&#39;t want you to be all alone tonight. So...if you 
wanted to, I&#39;m sure Mother wouldn&#39;t mind.&quot;

Minako took an involuntary step backwards. The adrenaline of the battle 
before had worn off, and her fear was winning out again. She wanted 
to...she truly did. Compared to the thought of spending a night with her 
best friend...her love...the thought of another night in her lonely, 
cold house was singularly unappealing. 

She cursed herself. -Why? Why can&#39;t I do this? I want to!- But she knew 
she couldn&#39;t. Her feelings were too intense, and they still terrified 
her. Going with Ami tonight would cross a line that Minako was just 
unable to cross. Ami was still looking at her, an expectant smile on her 
face. &quot;Ami-chan...&quot; She started, her voice cracking slightly. She 
swallowed and tried again. &quot;Ami-chan...I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good 
idea.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Ami just looked shocked. That was obviously not the answer she had 
been expecting. &quot;That&#39;s okay Mina-chan.&quot; Her hurt expression cut Minako 
right to the heart, and Ami quickly turned away. &quot;I understand...I&#39;ll 
see you around...&quot;

Minako turned around herself and actually took several steps towards 
home. Then she stopped. &quot;Minako.&quot; She took a deep breath. &quot;Decide...is 
this how you want things to be? Because if you want things to be 
different...it has to be now.&quot;

She turned back. Ami was walking away, her head lowered dejectedly. 
Minako bit her lip tightly and jogged back. &quot;Ami-chan!&quot; Ami looked back, 
suspiciously wiping her eyes as she turned. 

Minako laid her hands on Ami&#39;s shoulders and looked her in the eyes. 
&quot;Ami-chan...I...&quot; She found herself blushing deeply as she spoke. 
&quot;You...&quot; She took another deep breath and smiled. &quot;Do you want to...go 
out with me sometime?&quot;

Ami just stared at her for a long moment. Then she began to blush as 
well. She offered a tiny smile. &quot;Mina-chan...you mean like a date?&quot;

Swallowing deeply, Minako just nodded. For an instant, she experienced a 
wholly new kind of fear. -What if she says no?- 

Only for an instant, though. Ami&#39;s smile widened, and she nodded back. 
&quot;I&#39;d love to, Mina-chan.&quot;

&quot;Great!&quot; Minako&#39;s voice cracked again, and she made a sour face. Ami 
just laughed softly and leaned her head against Minako&#39;s arm. Minako and 
Ami both stood like that for what seemed like both a very long moment, 
and one that was over all too quickly.   
 
Finally Ami giggled a little bit. &quot;So...&quot; 
 
Minako blinked, not understanding. &quot;So...?&quot; 
 
Ami smiled. &quot;So, when did you want to...?&quot; 
 
&quot;Oh...oh!&quot; Minako blushed, a silly grin on her face. &quot;Um...I 
guess...Saturday?&quot;  
 
&quot;Great!&quot; Ami beamed. &quot;I&#39;ll be at your house at six, alright?&quot; She very 
gently disentangled herself from Minako&#39;s arms, letting her hands linger 
on the blonde girl&#39;s as she did so. &quot;See you tomorrow, Mina-chan.&quot; She 
said softly, smiling. 

&quot;Tomorrow...&quot; Minako smiled back, a little dazed. Ami walked off down 
the street, turning back when she was about twenty feet away to wave. 
Minako waved back absently, wearing the same fuzzy smile. 

Finally, Minako headed home herself. The rest of the night was a blur to 
her. She remembered little of the walk home, save that it never felt 
like her feet actually touched the ground. When she got there, Artemis 
was waiting, full of questions about the day&#39;s massive battle. Minako 
answered them with some part of her brain she wasn&#39;t really familiar 
with. Artemis finally got fed up with her rather haphazard answers and 
let her get ready for bed. 

Minako fell asleep with relatively little trouble, given the fact that 
her entire body felt like it was buzzing with electricity, especially 
where she had made contact with Ami. The one certainty she had was that, 
despite her continued reservations, despite how scared she still was 
(and oh, she *was* scared,) despite all of that...she was happy.

AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE: You know, with how popular the &#39;slow built&#39; approach has 
been so far, I&#39;m actually rather nervous taking a step this big. 
However, I really think it&#39;s time...not that it&#39;s going to be smooth 
sailing for the two of them from here on in, far from it. ^_^ But 
there&#39;s only so long they can dance around each other before I&#39;d just be 
dragging events out for the sake of dragging them out. And besides, 
given the differences in their personalities, I&#39;ve just been itching to 
have the pair of them hit the town!

Sailormoon and all other characters in this story belong to their 
respective owners. Figure it out. ^_^</pre>
