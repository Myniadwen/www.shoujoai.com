<h1>Someday Out of the Blue (part 4 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/immeblue.html">Immeblue</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/sumdayblu-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>The next evening Makoto and Koan were on there way to dine at the 
hotel restaurant when Makoto saw little Mako again, this time with a 
different nanny. Makoto smiled to herself, &#145;good riddance to that 
other one.&#39; 

Koan and Makoto weren&#39;t seated long before she realized that Ami was 
in the diningroom too. This time Ami was only with one person, a man. 
Makoto&#39;s stomach burned as she figured it may be Ami&#39;s husband. The 
burning soothed as Makoto realized Ami was still /Mizuno/ Ami, only to 
inflame again when she discerned that didn&#39;t mean much.

&quot;Hon you ok?&quot; Makoto brought her mind back to her own husband &quot;you 
look a bit sick.&quot; 

Makoto looked down at her plate slightly guilty. About what, she 
wasn&#39;t sure. 

&quot;Mako?&quot; 

The concern in his voice made her look up, she was touched. Though it 
didn&#39;t last long as she caught the look in his eyes. They were empty. 
He looked at his dinner with more desire, more regard, than he did at 
her. Makoto was hurt and fascinated, why hadn&#39;t she seen it before. 
&#145;How long has he been doing that?&#39; she wondered &#145;pretending he cared.&quot; 
She didn&#39;t see his hand reach over to grab hers, but she felt it. 
Still, fascinated and dumbstruck by her new discovery she continued to 
stare into his eyes. Maybe some emotion will flicker in them.

&quot;Makoto?&quot; he whispered &quot;do you want to go back to the room?&quot;

&#145;There it is&#39; the flicker of emotion she wanted to see in his eyes. 
She was just taken aback at which it was, &#145;annoyance.&#39; 

Makoto pulled her hand away and sat up straight, &#145;probably annoyed 
that I&#39;d ruin his dinner.&#39;

&quot;I&#39;m fine. Lets just enjoy our food.&quot;

&quot;Alright,&quot; Koan agreed already continuing with his meal, &quot;If you 
insist.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Just before dessert arrived Koan&#39;s cell phone rang. From Koan&#39;s side 
of the conversation it was clear what was going on. He was urgently 
needed back at the agency. Makoto had no intention of stopping him 
from going, and he was surprised that she didn&#39;t. He was even more 
surprised when she didn&#39;t protest his suggestion that she stay and use 
the room since it was paid for. He was out the door before she had a 
chance to change her mind. Not that she would have, Makoto knew what 
he was doing and just didn&#39;t care anymore. As she sat on the bed and 
stared at the door she didn&#39;t understand /why/ she didn&#39;t care, but 
she was glad she didn&#39;t. &#145;Wonder how long it would take my lawyer to 
serve him divorce papers.&#39;
