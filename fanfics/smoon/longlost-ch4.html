Talking Through the Mind &lt;&gt;

Lunarian and any others []

A.N. Ok people I Really Need help here so if any other authors would 
like to Help I would Really like that. And you guys should know the 
drill by now I do not own anything save for Crystal Rose Winter A.K.A 
Sailor Ice. And I hope you like the story so please R&amp;R to let me 
know. Oh and one last thing I like all of the Scouts so they will not 
turn bad and as you can tell I do not like Darien so he will be BAD&#133; 
Ok on with story J 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

    As the three where fighting Serena and Michelle were off to the 
side. After coming out of the shock of what she had heard and how 
Darien had been treating her Serena too started to remember her REAL 
past. And with those memories came the truth of the downfall of the 
kingdom. And the anger that she had been blind to the fact that it was 
Amara that came to her rescue all the time and NOT Darien. 

    And happiness that she knew the truth. And when she saw that 
Crystal was in the fight she also knew that Sailor Ice was her best 
friend and that she was also the second in command of the Sailor Scout 
being that she was is and all ways will be the leader of the Outer 
Sailor Scouts and the Princess of a planet that has long since been 
dead thanks to Queen Beryl. The last planet in the system was a planet 
called Iceland. 

Meanwhile

    The inner Scouts were at the temple to see if they could find out 
who this new enemy was and who Sailor Ice is. &#147;I don&#146;t see how you&#146;re 
going to find anything girls we should just wait until she is ready to 
tell us who she is.&#147; Came a British voice belonging to Luna. &#147;that is 
not the only reason we are here Luna we didn&#146;t tell you guys this but 
we as in Amy Lita Mina and I have also been having strange dreams 
lately, and we want to know what they are about so I am going to do a 
fire reading to find out ok.&#148; Said a smirking Raye. 

    However what they did not know was that four sets of eyes where 
watching everything that the Scouts did some would think that they 
were evil but instead of the cold look in the four sets of eyes there 
was a gentle tenderness as each of the four looked at Amy, Raye, Lita, 
and Mina. 

    (A.N. I will give you three guesses as to who the four are.) A 
gentle pair of gray blue eyes softened even more when they looked at 
Mina just as a gentle pair of forest green eyes looked towards Lita. 

    However these two could not withstand the gentleness that came 
from two other pairs of royal blue and sapphire blue eyes that looked 
towards Amy and Raye. As strong, but gentle voices floated down. 

    &#147;Jadeite would you PLEASE stop drooling over Raye, I don&#146;t think 
that we should let them know that we are back just yet.&#148; &#147;Your just do 
not like the fact that if you go down there and tell them or should I 
say her that you&#146;re back Zoicite.&#148; That was closely followed by a 
&#147;Would you BOTH SHUT UP BECAUSE I DON&#146;T THINK THAT ANY OF US WANT TO 
GET ZAPPED BY LITA&#146;S LIGHTING!&#148; By this time the third voice had gone 
up so high that all ten of the Sailors had heard and where about to 
attack. (A.N. if you guess the four Generals then you where right.) 
the fourth unknown voice looked down towards the Scouts. &#147;uh oh I 
think we are in trouble guys.&#148;
