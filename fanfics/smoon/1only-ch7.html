&quot;She&#39;ll be back soon.I&#39;m sure of it my lady.&quot; Saturn murmured as 
Galaxia paced back and forth.

&quot;She should have been back by now Hotaru!&quot; Galaxia snapped back, 
wincing as the young senshi cringed away from her.

&quot;Galaxia!!!&quot;

The golden senshi started as the senshi of Neptune and Uranus ran back 
into the shrouded area protected by Galaxia, a look of pure horror on 
each of their faces.

&quot;What is it? What&#39;s happening?!&quot; Gal demanded, grasping Uranus&#39;s 
shoulders as the senshi fell to her knees, tears welling in her eyes 
as she stared into the eyes of her comandress.

&quot;The palace.has fallen.&quot;

Galaxia&#39;s fingers went limp on the younger girl&#39;s shoulders as denial 
shot through her system, paralyzing her for a few terrifying seconds 
before she dashed out of the sacred protected area, followed closely 
by the outer senshi.

Blood stained the once white marble pathways as the four women ran as 
fast as possible to the gates of the palace, unseeing of the crumbled 
walls of the palace grounds, littered with bodies of fallen soldiers 
and Lunarian Nobility alike.

Galaxia felt tears welling in her eyes, blurring her vision as she 
realized it was her fault that so many had died, her once cold 
conviction shattered as she felt remorse for the first time in many 
years. She stopped cold as they reached the grounds outside the 
palace, her eyes running over the crumbled building that once served 
as a beautiful palace for the Lunarian family.

&quot;NO!!&quot;

The scream startled Galaxia until she realized it was her own blood 
chilling cry of anguish as she ran to the center of the courtyard, 
dropping helplessly to her knees by the cold, lifeless body of her 
princess, not seeing the other three scouts gather in a protective 
circle around her, nor the swarm of demons gather ever closer around 
them all.

&quot;Serenity.my darling Serenity.&quot; the golden senshi whispered, gathering 
the young princess&#39;s battered body into her arms as the three other 
senshi ran into the wall of demons, calls of their attacks having no 
effect on the miserable woman.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry I failed you.&quot;

Neptune.deep.SUBMERGE!!!

&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have been so vengeful.&quot;

Uranus.world.SHAKING!!!!

&quot;If I&#39;d never returned you&#39;d still be alive.&quot; Maroon eyes opened as a 
small hand rested on her back. Turning, Galaxia looked at the death 
senshi standing close behind her. Looking around, she saw the battered 
senshi of Neptune and Uranus close by, the whole group protected by 
the wall surrounding them, erected by the silence senshi.

&quot;My lady.you have to.&quot; Saturn whispered, casing a meaningful look at 
the long glaive in her hands.

&quot;Saturn.if I use this.then you&#39;ll die as well.so will they.&quot; Galaxia 
whispered, shaking her head in silent denial of the last option they 
had.

&quot;We&#39;ll die anyway.but at least we&#39;d be taking them with us.&quot; Uranus 
whispered, pulling Neptune closer to her.

Galaxia stood up, reluctantly letting go of her beautiful princess&#39;s 
body to look around her. Looking up, she noticed something small and 
furry at the edge of the barrier Saturn had put up. Walking over, she 
reached under the body of sailor Venus to retrieve the black bundle of 
fur she remembered to be Luna, the princess&#39;s guardian.

&quot;MEROW!!!!&quot;

Galaxia let out a startled yelp as the sharp claws of the cat cut into 
the side of her face, dropping the guardian to land hard on the ground 
by her feet.

&quot;Luna!&quot; Saturn scolded, reaching up to heal Gal&#39;s face before being 
stopped by the golden senshi.

&quot;they&#39;re all dead.all of them.&quot; the tiny cat sobbed, allowing the 
golden senshi to pick her up without clawing her face again.

Not a word was said as Saturn passed her glaive to the golden haired 
woman holding the black cat-guardian close to her chest. Neptune 
closed her eyes, enjoying the last embrace and final kiss she and her 
lover would ever have while Saturn simple knelt at Galaxia&#39;s feet, 
waiting for her death to befall her.

Placing a finger on Luna&#39;s forehead, Gal surged the cat with golden 
energy, changing the silver-gold moon on her forehead to an upside 
down gold moon.

&quot;You shall stay with me little kitten.We&#39;ll find our princess again.&quot; 
Galaxia whispered before raising the glaive over her head, empowering 
it with golden energy before whispering the silent words that would 
end it for the Silver Millennium.

&quot;Silence.wall.&quot;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pluto watched with no surprise from her post at the time gates as 
golden energy flooded the entire surface of the moon, whipping out 
every trace of life on the moon with one clean sweep. Watching with 
sorrowful Magenta eyes, she saw the demoness, Beryl, destroyed with 
her ranks, the bodies of dead soldiers and senshi alike vanished, and 
the rubble of the palace disintegrated.

Pluto turned, the gates of time closing behind her as the strongest 
senshi collapsed to the dusty ground of the moon, her scream of agony 
echoing through time..
