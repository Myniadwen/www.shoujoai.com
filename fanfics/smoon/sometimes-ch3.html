<h1>It's Sometimes Called Falling in Love (part 3 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alli.html">Haruka</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/sometimes-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;Twice in six months, Haruka. Is the food that good?&quot;

Michiru sat amidst the machines and tubes criss-crossing over the 
athlete&#39;s limp and numb body. Her clostrophobia had subsided within a 
minute of touching the blonde strands of hair, though she had to force 
herself away. In a fit of romantic passion, she tried to will Haruka 
to open her eyes like she did three months prior and force coolness 
that Michiru would not be so easily fooled by. Then, they would kiss 
and everything would live happily ever after.

&quot;Goddesses aren&#39;t afraid to love.&quot;

At the next station, she deboarded the train, flying up the stairs 
with no idea where she was going. She was not able to tell if she was 
blessed or cursed to see a motorcycle approaching the street Michiru 
was standing by, then beginning to desperately wave just as the chorus 
of tires gliding on asphalt to the demolition of plexiglass and steel. 
There was no blood at first, then there was only a small trickle 
running from her cracked and deserted lips.

What I would give for her to breathe words... With painful reality, 
she was reminded of the plastic jungle that surrounded her. What I 
would give to have her breathe. The accordian to her side belted out 
its rythmical groan as it forced Haruka&#39;s chest to rise, assuring that 
Michiru&#39;s hopes were futile. There was no point in Michiru staying by 
the body that Haruka once possessed, but every attempt she made to 
leave was beaten by her sobbing fits, only calmed by memories of 
mid-afternoon chats too-short visits.

Haruka... where have you gone?

The paramedics had left, and all Michiru had to look at was the empty 
bed where she once laid. She nodded at words, distantly attempting to 
make her girlfriend not worry so, and did not feel anything more than 
the air rustle her hair when her arms wrapped around her.

The sirens are so loud.

She did not say anything for weeks after the parade of black with 
fawning admirers of a life Haruka led that Michiru felt, by the fan&#39;s 
words, that she was somehow envied for holding such a close part in. 
Could they too see how much Haruka loved her? Could they see how much 
I love her? She went to work, only mechanically playing the violin, 
for if she felt any passion at all, the fragile dam she built would 
break and she would feel everything that she had been trying to 
forget.

Her helmet had been thrown off, leaving her hair wild and vulnerable 
to the wind.

&quot;Haruka!!!&quot; she shouted, though she was only a foot away from her.

Blue skies were revealed, and she focused on the one reason she had 
lived this long.

&quot;I&#39;m...&quot; Haruka struggled with the words through tears and blood. &quot;I&#39;m 
glad that I could love you... it. It was the best thing I could have 
ever done.&quot;

&quot;Haruka-&quot; but it was too late. Haruka&#39;s eyes closed for the last time, 
and she was gone.

~*~

&quot;I love you, my sky&quot; she whispered into the wind. It was too late, she 
was never one for punctuality, but she felt something hug her heart. 
&quot;That is the best thing that I could ever do.&quot;

Responding to her girlfriend&#39;s pleas, she returned inside to the 
fireplace, always remembering the eternal wind.
