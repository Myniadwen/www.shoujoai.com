<h1>Absence (part 54 of 60)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kirika.html">Kirika</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/absence-ch53.html">Back to Part 53</a><pre>Sailor Neptune exhaled deeply in heartfelt relief as the sounds of 
fervently chasing youma behind her and Tuxedo Kamen began to fade into a 
muffled background noise, joining the muted clamour of the other echoes 
of skirmishes that could be heard through the walls. The pair had been 
running for what felt like hours, but finally after frantically darting 
randomly from room to room and corridor to corridor in the office 
building, it seemed like the dark assassins had lost their trail. 
Neptune rested her fatigued body against a nearby wall, bowing her head 
as she tried to catch her breath and let her frenzied heartbeat subside. 
Her left arm stung something fierce from the arrow still buried deeply 
into her flesh, but the blood had crusted over the wound somewhat at 
least, preventing any more loss of precious oxygenated fluids the Outer 
Senshi&#39;s drained body couldn&#39;t afford to lose. To say it had been 
difficult to run while sporting a broken arrow in her arm would have 
been an understatement. The sensation of the arrow&#39;s snapped shaft 
quivering in Neptune&#39;s upper arm as she sprinted was... unpleasant. The 
Senshi of the Ocean had done her best to keep her arm as straight and 
rigid as possible by her side to avoid the sharp, piercing, pain, but it 
was hard to concentrate on such a task when hosts of murderous youma 
forced you to dash wildly all over an expansive skyscraper. Sailor 
Neptune wasn&#39;t even aware of what floor she and Tuxedo Kamen were on 
now.

After taking several moments to compose herself, Sailor Neptune looked 
up to see Tuxedo Kamen bent over with his hands on his knees, still 
panting heavily. Outwardly, the man looked to have seen better days; his 
cape and the tuxedo that was his namesake had appeared to have been put 
in a shredder and then violently spat out again, but Sailor Neptune knew 
that beneath the dishevelled garb his body had only sustained minor 
injuries. Neptune glanced down at her own ruined outfit. Her fuku looked 
as if a swarm of moths had opted to have it as their main course in a 
feeding frenzy. The aquamarine-haired woman pursed her lips 
distastefully at the numerous holes that more often than not revealed 
blood stained skin. The fast pursuit did not stop some youma from 
frequently suspending their chase of Sailor Neptune and Tuxedo Kamen to 
take pot shots at the fleeing pair with their short bows, crossbows, or 
throwing knives. Neptune was very thankful that luck had been with her 
and Tuxedo Kamen during their flight; suffering a debilitating wound in 
their backs and/or legs would have definitely spelt their demise.

&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Tuxedo Kamen asked with concern, causing Sailor 
Neptune to cease her scrutiny of her cut up body and raise her head to 
meet the man&#39;s eyes.

&quot;I have had better days,&quot; Neptune replied dryly, glancing back down at 
her scruffy fuku and then left at her injured arm. &quot;And you?&quot; she then 
inquired in return.

Tuxedo Kamen gave a wane half-smile and then stood upright, shrugging 
his shoulders indifferently as he did so. He took a moment to survey 
their new surroundings. &quot;This place looks like a cafeteria,&quot; Tuxedo 
Kamen commented curiously.

Sailor Neptune looked at the numerous circular tables surrounded by 
silver metal chairs that filled the sizeable eating area as she wandered 
about with Tuxedo Kamen, her companion a few feet to the left of her. 
She shifted her exploring gaze to the long aluminium buffet on one side 
of the room and approached it, before wiping the cool metallic surface 
with one gloved fingertip.

&quot;It appears the facilities here haven&#39;t been used for quite some time,&quot; 
Neptune remarked over her shoulder to Tuxedo Kamen as she noted the 
black smear of dirt standing out in stark relief on her white glove. 
&quot;Either that or the cleaners are rather negligent.&quot;

&quot;I guess human food is an acquired taste for youma,&quot; the prince said 
wryly from a short distance behind the Senshi of the Sea as he walked 
between the cream coloured tables, continuing to examine the 
surroundings.

&quot;Me don&#39;t know, me like *human* food-food...&quot; sneered an unknown, thin, 
shrill voice from the double door entrance to the cafeteria. &quot;And me 
find some now...&quot;

Both Sailor Neptune and Tuxedo Kamen whirled around sharply to the 
source of the voice at almost the same instant, each in a ready stance, 
primed to clash with the owner of the hostile voice at a split second&#39;s 
notice.

Three darkly dressed, vaguely humanoid, youma assassins stood in front 
of the entrance, but it was obvious to Neptune that the one in the 
middle was the leader. And also the most formidable of the trio. The 
middle youma looked like a giant, hairless, albino rat that strode 
upright on two feet. It&#39;s clothing, or rather rags, were also the most 
unkempt assassin apparel Neptune had ever seen on any of the enemy. The 
majority of the rat youma&#39;s outfit was made up of long, hanging, frayed 
strips of black fabric that left its hands and feet, or more accurately, 
paws, uncovered, along with its lashing tail. A wide-brimmed slightly 
coned shaped hat made out of weaved bamboo, in a style reminiscent of 
Japanese feudal times, graced the youma&#39;s lowered head, hiding its 
bestial features from view.

The rat youma touched the brim of its hat with a thumb, pushing it up as 
he raised its head. A hideously ugly rodent visage greeted Sailor 
Neptune as the assassin&#39;s face was revealed, and the senshi fought the 
urge to heave. The creature&#39;s face was lumpy, like it was riddled with 
tumours, and its malevolent cheesy grin contained more than one broken 
yellow tooth. Red eyes shone with baleful intelligence that first 
narrowed at the sight of Tuxedo Kamen, as the youma sized the man up, 
and then widened when they moved to Neptune, the assassin&#39;s evil smile 
grew even more, beyond what the woman thought possible.

A thick slimy tongue slithered out of the youma&#39;s maw and licked its 
cracked lips lewdly. &quot;Pretty-pretty...&quot; it twittered at Sailor Neptune, 
the disgusting creature&#39;s intense stare disturbing the Outer Senshi 
greatly, provoking her to cover her chest in a protective gesture with 
her good arm. A paw reached down to the rat youma&#39;s waist and touched 
the end of a long, slender, slightly curved piece of wood similar in 
shape to a bokken, stuck in its belt. &quot;Human female... me like-like...&quot; 
it declared in its squeaky voice, slavering its greasy saliva all over 
its mouth as it drunk in Neptune&#39;s attractive exterior. The youma&#39;s nose 
twitched, as if it smelt something in the air. &quot;Blood-blood smell 
good... good scent-scent...&quot;

Tuxedo Kamen began to warily step defensively in front of an appalled 
Sailor Neptune as the youma leered repulsively at the woman, the man 
gripping his black cane in an iron grip with both hands in front of him. 
&quot;Back off,&quot; the prince growled menacingly at the giant rodent.

The rat assassin hissed at Tuxedo Kamen threateningly, its tail pounding 
against the floor more fiercely behind it in a rhythmic beat. &quot;Female 
your mate-mate?&quot; it asked inquisitively, its red eyes boring into the 
prince.

&quot;No--&quot; Sailor Neptune started to respond, finally finding her voice, but 
was promptly cut off by the youma.

&quot;Heh heh,&quot; the creature sniggered, and then tensed, its waving tail 
halting completely in mid motion. &quot;No matter, you mine-mine now! Take 
her! Kill man-creature!! KILL-KILL!!&quot;

Without warning Neptune felt strong hands roughly grab her arms from 
behind, pinning them firmly to her sides. The startled senshi&#39;s head 
snapped to her left and then to her right, and realised with rapidly 
rising panic that another two youma assassins had materialised silently 
from the shadows behind her, and now had her totally at their mercy. 
Neptune struggled mightily nevertheless --as best she could with her 
wounded arm constantly sending sharp twinges of pain to her brain-- but 
the pair of youma had a secure grip on her, one the aquamarine-haired 
woman did not have the strength to break. She resorted to kicking 
brutally at the enemies&#39; legs, but her close proximity did not allow her 
enough leverage to grant her attacks any substantial force, and the 
youma easily shrugged them off.

&quot;Neptune!&quot; Tuxedo Kamen shouted as he saw the woman&#39;s predicament, but 
before he could move to help her, the other two youma that had been by 
the rat assassin&#39;s side had already bolted forward, each smoothly 
drawing a steel ninja-to from their backs with a dual metallic ring that 
echoed ominously around the cafeteria.

Tuxedo Kamen swiftly pivoted on one foot and turned to face the pair of 
charging assassins, only just barely bringing up his cane in time as a 
silver blade slashed sideways at him, deflecting off his weapon in a 
shower of sparks. As Sailor Neptune watched, Tuxedo Kamen was quickly 
forced back under a relentless flurry of blows, the prince&#39;s arms moving 
in nearly a blur as he frantically blocked each potentially deadly 
strike in succession.

&quot;Man-thing be dead-dead soon,&quot; Neptune heard the rat youma&#39;s portentous 
voice whisper in her ear, the assassin no doubt having used the shadows 
to reposition itself close behind her. Her eyes started to water as the 
creature&#39;s filthy breath wafted near her face, the stench akin to raw 
sewage.

&quot;Ohhh--!&quot; Sailor Neptune moaned in pure repugnance, shivering as the rat 
assassin&#39;s arms encircled her trim waist. She grimaced and felt her 
stomach churn as the creature&#39;s long oily tongue slobbered over her 
cheek, coating her skin with an abundant amount of dribbling drool.

&quot;Mmm... tasty-tasty...&quot; the rodent youma murmured in its strange way of 
talking, and then moved one paw up to the senshi&#39;s wounded arm while its 
comrades continued to hold its prey still. It violently grabbed the 
broken arrow shaft embedded in her arm and then twisted it viciously, 
eliciting a shocked and agonising scream from Neptune. &quot;Screams a sweet 
melody...&quot; the cruel assassin absently mumbled, and then twisted the 
arrow in the opposite direction mercilessly, forcing blood to flow in 
red rivulets down the Sailor&#39;s arm. A single tear of torment rolled down 
Sailor Neptune&#39;s face from her flooded blue eyes as she concentrated 
with all that she was not to give the sadistic youma the pleasure of 
hearing her cries of suffering, the woman only unable to prevent letting 
out a small whimper. Never before had Neptune so wished for Haruka to be 
fighting by her side. If her lover were here her giant rat torturer 
would surely already be a red smear on the wall. But Haruka wasn&#39;t here. 
With Tuxedo Kamen currently occupied battling two sword-wielding 
assassins, Sailor Neptune was on her own; she could rely on no one but 
herself. While she knew independence was normally a good thing, without 
Haruka by her side she felt... weaker, incomplete. Together the two 
women formed a whole and functioned in concert as a well-oiled machine, 
both reading the other&#39;s moves without conscious thought. But without 
Haruka, Sailor Neptune was crippled. The aquamarine-haired woman watched 
Tuxedo Kamen as he dived to his right and rolled quickly to his feet 
once more, smashing one youma&#39;s ninja-to away from his body as he rose. 
If only Tuxedo Kamen could break off his fight long enough to distract 
one of her captors for an instant, then maybe she could use the lull in 
the creature&#39;s focus to free herself. Neptune continued to watch the 
m&ecirc;l&eacute;e with feverish eyes as she started to sweat, the level of 
concentration needed to block out the excruciating sensations from the 
rat youma torturing her arm requiring every ounce of her mental 
strength.

Tuxedo Kamen ducked as one youma sliced at neck height, almost 
decapitating him cleanly. He quickly lunged forward with his cane and 
jabbed the assassin in the stomach, knocking the wind out of its lungs 
and making it hunch over in pain. Tuxedo Kamen planted one hand on the 
bent youma&#39;s back and then vaulted over the assassin, kicking out with 
both feet at the other rapidly approaching youma, crushing his heels 
directly into its face with devastating force. The black-clad assassin 
staggered backwards holding one hand to its nose as Tuxedo Kamen&#39;s feet 
hit the floor, and the prince immediately took advantage of the enemy&#39;s 
inattention. A lush red rose flashed forth from the man&#39;s gloved hand 
and struck the youma&#39;s eye, the power of the impact enough to drive the 
flower&#39;s razor-sharp stem into the assassin&#39;s brain, ending its life. As 
the creature dropped its ninja-to from its now limp grasp and toppled 
backwards, Tuxedo Kamen spun around and brought his cane ruthlessly 
downwards, most likely hoping to clout the hunched over and exposed 
youma on the back of the head. But instead all the cane met was air, and 
the prince suddenly howled in pain as a sword&#39;s tip stabbed shallowly 
into his shoulder before being hastily bashed away by his weapon.

Tuxedo Kamen jumped back and then paused for a moment as a rose appeared 
in his free hand. The youma before him tensed, bringing up its ninja-to 
in a defensive stance, ready to deflect the projectile. Tuxedo Kamen 
lifted his arm to throw the rose, his wounded shoulder only seeming to 
affect him to a minor degree, but then abruptly angled the shot to his 
right, taking everyone by surprise. The hold on Sailor Neptune&#39;s left 
arm suddenly loosened and then was gone, the assassin slumping to the 
floor with a rose buried deeply where its heart would have been. Knowing 
this was the chance she had been waiting for, Neptune dived to her left, 
managing to break free of the other youma&#39;s restraining grip, and also 
the rat assassin&#39;s malicious hold on the arrow in her arm. The woman 
landed heavily on her side on the hard floor, but she ignored the pain 
of the abrupt jolt; she had to act now.

&quot;DEEP SUBMERGE!&quot;

Sailor Neptune yelled out her attack and launched a huge blue sphere of 
water at her recovered and now pouncing youma captor, the creature with 
its own ninja-to raised high over its head, ready to cleave the 
liberated senshi in twain. The ball of cold liquid slammed into the 
leaping assassin and smothered it, suspending the creature in mid air as 
its life force was drained completely from its body. The sphere 
deteriorated, and the youma&#39;s cadaver dropped lifelessly to the floor, 
the crumbling metal of its ninja-to blade flaking down like weighted 
dust motes with the corpse.

The remaining sword-wielding youma dropped its guard for only a fraction 
of a second due to the all the commotion involving Neptune, but it was 
enough for the alert Tuxedo Kamen to benefit from. Three roses were 
suddenly blooming bizarrely from the youma&#39;s chest, black blood 
splattering to the floor from the triple piercing strikes. The darkly 
dressed creature looked down at its bleeding body with something akin to 
astonishment in its eyes, and then collapsed to its knees, dropping its 
sword with a metallic clatter, before keeling over to one side, dead.

The now unaccompanied rat youma looked between the slowly decaying 
bodies of its allies and then glared hatefully at Tuxedo Kamen, its lips 
curling up menacingly as a low growl sounded from its throat. &quot;Human 
scum-scum,&quot; the assassin spat venomously as it pulled the long polished 
piece of wood from its belt, holding it with one paw near the top. 
Sailor Neptune started to clamber laboriously to her feet when the 
humanoid rat&#39;s free arm flashed out at her to the side, a handful of 
shiny spinning objects sailing through the air in the woman&#39;s direction. 
Neptune frantically rolled to her right as the barrage of shurikens 
embedded themselves in the floor where she had once lain, one 
star-shaped projectile hitting close enough to fasten one end of the 
Outer Senshi&#39;s rear bow of her fuku to the hard surface. &quot;You sit 
tight-tight,&quot; the rat youma demanded Sailor Neptune, but kept his red 
eyes fixed on his opponent named Tuxedo Kamen.

Suddenly, both Tuxedo Kamen and the scruffy assassin rushed forwards at 
one another, one bringing up a black cane, the other holding a thin 
piece of wood out wide to the right. A loud crack sounded as Tuxedo 
Kamen&#39;s cane smacked against the youma&#39;s stick, and the prince swiftly 
darted backwards, and then bolted forwards once more, raising his cane 
over his head with both hands, preparing to deliver a bludgeoning 
overhead strike to his opponent. However, the rat creature was faster, 
and lashed out brutally with one foot, kicking Tuxedo Kamen directly in 
the chest and sending the man sprawling over a cafeteria table.

&quot;DEEP SUBMERGE!&quot;

Sailor Neptune invoked her primary attack from her prone position, 
casting a large ball of shimmering water in the youma&#39;s direction. The 
rodent assassin&#39;s nose twitched, and then it dropped to a low crouch 
--the dangling black strips of cloth that made up its garments snapping 
sharply with the abrupt movement-- before catapulting itself up high 
into the air, allowing Neptune&#39;s projectile to fly under him and splash 
harmlessly against a wall. The youma twisted its body three hundred and 
sixty degrees in the air, its clothes flailing wildly, and then aimed 
both its feet downwards, preparing to stomp on Tuxedo Kamen&#39;s vulnerable 
form still lying on the round table. At the last possible second, Tuxedo 
Kamen rolled off the table, just as the rat youma&#39;s bare feet slammed 
onto the centre of it, snapping the flimsy furniture in two. Tuxedo 
Kamen scrambled to his feet as his assailant ferociously knocked the 
ruined pieces of table aside, the creature&#39;s tail lashing angrily as it 
tramped through the debris.

Sailor Neptune struggled to a standing position with the help of a 
nearby chair, tearing her rear bow on her fuku and wobbling on her feet 
slightly as she stood, while Tuxedo Kamen dived to one side as a volley 
of shurikens were furiously hurled his way. It was obvious that Tuxedo 
Kamen needed her help, and Neptune was more than willing to oblige. Her 
arm continually beat in waves of pain, but she distanced her thoughts 
from the distracting and uncomfortable sensations. As Tuxedo Kamen 
fought frantically with the rodent assassin, Sailor Neptune staggered 
away from the chair, repositioning herself to try and get a clear shot 
at the enemy.

Tuxedo Kamen&#39;s cane banged against the youma&#39;s polished stick with a yet 
another hard crack as both fighters attacked at the same time, their 
weapons locking as they each pushed forward against their respective foe 
with all their might, attempting to overbalance the other. The strain 
showed on Tuxedo Kamen&#39;s face and his arms trembled with the effort as 
he only barely matched the youma&#39;s strength. Sweat was visible beading 
on the man&#39;s forehead while the assassin hissed threateningly at him, 
droplets of slimy spittle being sprayed on the prince&#39;s face, but he 
didn&#39;t even react in the slightest to the distraction.

After several moments of the testing its strength against Tuxedo Kamen, 
the rat youma&#39;s evil red eyes narrowed craftily, its wagging tail 
freezing, and Sailor Neptune saw the creature&#39;s left hand grip his 
wooden stick tighter, and then pull on one end. A glint of metal could 
be seen as the youma continued to pull on the apparently loose section 
of wood, and Neptune&#39;s blue eyes widened in horror as realisation dawned 
on her.

&quot;A shirasaya sword!!&quot; Sailor Neptune shrieked out in warning to Tuxedo 
Kamen, at the same moment the rodent assassin fully drew the katana from 
its sheath.

The youma abruptly broke off its push against Tuxedo Kamen&#146;s cane with 
the now empty scabbard of his weapon, before twirling around in a blur 
of motion, its katana held in a reverse grip. Tuxedo Kamen threw himself 
backwards desperately at Neptune&#39;s frantic warning, but it was too late. 
The youma&#39;s blade slashed across the prince&#39;s stomach as he jumped back, 
ripping a line in his clothes that was quickly filled with spilling 
blood.

&quot;NO!!&quot; Sailor Neptune screamed and rushed forwards as Tuxedo Kamen 
stumbled backwards, clutching at his sliced open stomach, no doubt 
trying to hold his insides in.

The rodent assassin sniggered evilly and then stabbed backwards at the 
recklessly sprinting Neptune, taking the distraught woman by surprise. 
The Senshi of the Ocean howled in absolute excruciating agony as the 
youma&#39;s katana punctured her left thigh and burst through the other side 
in an eruption of red, before the sharp tip of the weapon stabbed into 
the floor, impaling the woman&#39;s leg and trapping the limb securely. 
Sailor Neptune continued to scream as the youma let go of its katana and 
left the senshi, totally disregarding the crippled woman as the giant 
rodent bounded towards the mortally wounded Tuxedo Kamen, ready to 
finish off the man with the shirasaya sword&#39;s solid wooden sheath.

Tuxedo Kamen raised his head slowly as the youma charged straight for 
him, glowering coldly at the grotesque humanoid rat. Suddenly, Tuxedo 
Kamen thrust his cane directly at the rushing youma and without warning 
the weapon&#39;s length extended outwards several feet, catching the shocked 
creature violently under the chin and knocking it in the opposite 
direction. As the evil assassin staggered backwards towards her, Sailor 
Neptune gritted her teeth and clutched the katana skewering her leg with 
both hands. With a cry of pain mixed with defiance, she smoothly drew 
the sword from her torn flesh in one fluid motion, letting her blood 
pump free from the unplugged wound. Balancing on her good foot with the 
torture of her left leg drowning out the pain in her arm, Neptune lunged 
at the youma&#39;s defenceless back with its own weapon stained with her 
blood, the end of the blade exploding from the doomed rodent&#39;s chest in 
a black spray. The rat creature screeched and thrashed as ebony fluid 
gurgled forth from its maw, the liquid a stark contrast to its pale 
white skin, while it shredded its fingers as it tried to extract the 
razor sharp blade from its body. Neptune lost her blood-slick grip on 
the sword&#39;s wooden handle with the youma&#39;s erratic death throes and was 
knocked to the floor, landing on her behind.

&quot;NOO!! Me no go dead-dead...!&quot; the rat assassin whimpered pitifully 
through the disgorging fluid streaming out of its mouth, its flailing 
becoming weaker and weaker with each passing second.

Finally, the giant rodent breathed its last and fell slowly to the 
floor, still twitching periodically as a black blood pooled around its 
carcass, much to Neptune&#39;s great relief. She was panting heavily, and 
her eyes were drawn to her bloody leg, the dark red fluid liberally 
soaking her thigh as it spewed out the hole in the limb holding her mind 
in a macabre enthrallment.

&quot;Oh, god, hang on,&quot; an anxious voice said from above the critically 
injured Outer Senshi, causing her to look languidly up. Tuxedo Kamen was 
standing before Neptune, his white shirt and left side of his jacket 
discoloured with his blood, but otherwise looking fine.

&quot;Your stomach...&quot; Sailor Neptune inquired lazily as her head felt like 
it was floating off her shoulders. &quot;I thought...&quot;

&quot;It was close, but it didn&#39;t cut deep enough to disembowel me,&quot; Tuxedo 
Kamen informed the aquamarine-haired woman as the prince took of his 
tattered cape and starting to tear ragged strips from it. &quot;But if it 
wasn&#39;t for you warning me, it might have been different...&quot;

Sailor Neptune mumbled something incomprehensible and nodded her head, 
nearly falling forward. Her mind was swimming in a sea of haze and she 
had trouble focusing. Without warning, a sharp pang of pain shot up to 
her brain from her leg, clearing the cotton from her mind with searing 
torment, before a dull throbbing set in. Neptune looked at her 
perforated thigh and saw that Tuxedo Kamen was just finishing tying a 
makeshift bandage made from his ripped cape tightly over her wound, the 
pressure helping to lessen the loss of blood. And the pain helping to 
keep her mind on the here and now.

Tuxedo Kamen grunted in pain as he tied a strip of his cape around his 
slashed stomach securely, and then exhaled deeply, visibly relaxing his 
muscles. He scrutinised Neptune&#39;s heavily wounded leg with worried eyes 
behind his mask, his brow furrowing deeply. The Senshi of the Ocean 
swallowed hard and wiped some of the sweat from her forehead. Sailor 
Neptune knew what he was thinking.

&quot;I can find my own way out,&quot; she said resolutely from the floor, staring 
off to the double door entrance of the cafeteria through the legs of 
tables and chairs. &quot;Sailor Moon is still here... you should go to her. I 
will only slow you down.&quot;

When she realised no response was forthcoming from Tuxedo Kamen, Neptune 
raised her gaze to the prince. &quot;No,&quot; Tuxedo Kamen finally stated 
levelly. &quot;No. I&#39;m not going to leave you like this,&quot; he went on, eyeing 
the Outer Senshi&#39;s grievous injury. &quot;Usagi will be all right for the 
time being. She&#39;s with...&quot; He paused briefly, hardly noticeable, but 
even with her wandering mind Sailor Neptune could still detect it. 
&quot;...Rei. Usagi&#39;s with Rei. I know Rei won&#39;t let any harm befall her.&quot;

Sailor Neptune nodded in acquiesce, studying Tuxedo Kamen&#39;s features 
circumspectly. The man&#39;s expression was completely impassive however, 
not so much as a hint of emotion being exhibited when he said the 
&#39;renegade&#39; Fire Senshi&#39;s name. Interesting. Sometimes no emotion meant 
the entirely opposite. But then the miko was still probably a touchy 
subject with the prince; the hurt of Usagi and Rei&#39;s secret relationship 
no doubt still fresh in his heart and mind.

Tuxedo Kamen shook his head slightly, as if clearing it. He crouched 
down beside the crippled Sailor Neptune and gently eased one arm around 
her waist, and the other under her legs, before hefting the woman up. A 
wince came to Tuxedo Kamen&#39;s face as his arms strained under the full, 
yet quite light, weight of Neptune, the man&#39;s torn stomach and weeping 
shoulder stab wound most likely the source of his discomfort. He spared 
another concerned glance at the Outer Senshi&#39;s leg, his eyes tightening 
somewhat as he noted that the improvised bandages had become saturated 
with dark red. Sailor Neptune&#39;s head rested against the prince&#39;s chest 
of its own accord, the effort needed to keep it upright simply too much 
for the aquamarine-haired woman. Her mouth was dry, and she felt chilled 
to the bone.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry; I&#39;ll get you out of here,&quot; Tuxedo Kamen assured her 
quietly. &quot;I&#39;ll get you help.&quot;

Breathing with quick, shallow, breaths, Neptune knew that she wasn&#39;t 
going to leave this building alive.

******

Wheezing, heavy, pants rapidly came from Sailor Venus&#39; throat as she ran 
slightly behind Sailor Saturn down one of several wide hallways in the 
youma skyscraper, while the countless thuds of swift footfalls echoed 
from the corridors behind her, the usually noiseless steps of shadowy 
assassins made loud by the sheer number of them. No other sounds from 
the enemy could be heard; no wordless war cries of hate, no venomous 
declarations of verbal abuse; just the persistent noise of a relentless 
horde, all simply keen to go about their cold task of murdering the 
escaping Venus and Saturn. It was unnerving, no, make that frightening, 
to the wounded Senshi of Love.

The arrow in Sailor Venus&#39; shoulder hurt horribly, but there was no time 
to even worry about it. Saturn was setting a very fast but steady pace 
ahead of her, and Venus was having great trouble keeping up. She felt as 
if she had been running a marathon prior to this, and her body was about 
ready to shut down due to all the exertion. Looking at Sailor Saturn&#39;s 
back as she jogged briskly in front of her, the Senshi of Love couldn&#39;t 
believe how the young girl could keep it up. But of course, she didn&#39;t 
have an arrow stuck in her.

&quot;Saturn... I... can&#39;t... go on... any... longer...!&quot; Sailor Venus gasped 
out between shuddering breaths, before slowing to a halt in a T-junction 
and collapsing back exhaustedly against a wall. Sweat was pouring off 
her, plastering her blonde bangs to her forehead and making her fuku 
stick to her body uncomfortably.

Sailor Saturn ceased her run and turned to the worn out Inner Senshi, 
planting the end of her Silence Glaive on the floor as she held it 
upright loosely in one hand. Her chest rose and fell quickly, but other 
than that, she didn&#39;t appear the least bit tired. &quot;We can&#39;t stop,&quot; the 
Senshi of Death and Rebirth said, her eyes flicking to the empty hallway 
they had been travelling down. There was no sign of any youma but the 
sounds of their movement. &quot;They&#39;ll catch up soon.&quot; Saturn turned back 
around, preparing to set off once more.

&quot;No! Hotaru I... I can&#39;t run anymore...&quot; Venus declared, leaning her 
head back tiredly against the wall and closing her eyes. She then opened 
them again as an idea came to her. &quot;Maybe if you could...&quot; She reached 
up to the arrow embedded in her shoulder and grabbed it, wincing at the 
painful sensation, and on a mental count of three, yanked hard on the 
barbed projectile, hoping to pull it out and allow Sailor Saturn to heal 
the serious injury. But, as an agony-wracked Venus soon found out, the 
arrow was too deeply imbedded in her body, the barbs too firmly stuck 
into her flesh. To continue to pull on it would result in pure torture 
and most likely severe damage to her person. Sailor Venus would probably 
pass out from the trauma.

Venus sighed in defeat as Saturn watched her strenuous efforts with a 
level, and rather cold, gaze. Sometimes when she looked into those 
chilly violet eyes of the Senshi of Death, a different person from the 
kind, timid, Hotaru looked back at her. It was as if when the girl 
transformed into her Sailor alter ego, it wasn&#39;t just her clothes that 
changed, but her personality as well. It was a disturbing thing to 
witness. The only thing that could break that serious veil was usually 
the presence of one of the other Outer Senshi, but sometimes not even 
they could truly do so. Chibi-Usa was always certain to however... but 
that could be expected.

Sailor Venus smiled softly at Sailor Saturn, coming to a decision. The 
sounds of youma were fast approaching, and time was running out for the 
both of them. No... for *one* of them. &quot;You... you run on ahead, 
Hotaru,&quot; the Inner Senshi said without inflection. &quot;I&#39;ll be right behind 
you. I just need to... rest for a second,&quot; she concluded, looking away 
from the young girl before her. She couldn&#39;t run any further; her body 
just couldn&#39;t take the strain. It would be better for Venus to remain 
behind and hold off the shadow-jumping youma as best she could to buy 
more time for Saturn to flee and maybe find the other Sailor Senshi and 
Tuxedo Kamen. One last display of heroics for Sailor V. The blonde could 
think of worse ways to go out. Hopefully Saturn would survive to tell 
the tale... but, in the end, it didn&#39;t really matter if it went unsung. 
Glory wasn&#39;t everything. And besides, it wasn&#39;t like she had anyone 
special in her life who would miss her.

Sailor Saturn merely stared at the resigned Sailor Venus with dead 
violet eyes, her pale face expressionless. She blinked once, and then 
simply stated; &quot;No.&quot;

Sailor Venus looked up at the Senshi of Death and Rebirth inquiringly. 
&quot;What do you mean, &#39;no&#39;?&quot; she said.

&quot;I mean no. I&#39;m not going,&quot; Saturn clarified, adjusting her grip on her 
Silence Glaive.

Venus frowned in irritation, starting to get a little angry. &quot;It&#39;s an 
order, Hotaru. Do I have to remind you who is in charge here? I&#39;m the 
leader of the Moon Princess&#39;s personal bodyguard, so I rank the highest 
here!&quot;

&quot;You are not the leader of me,&quot; Sailor Saturn said evenly.

&quot;I am to! So do as I say!&quot; Venus demanded, resisting the urge to stamp 
her foot. She wasn&#39;t the belligerent child here, after all.

&quot;No,&quot; Saturn stubbornly persisted.

This was getting ridiculous. Youma were about to swarm their position 
for god&#39;s sake, and Saturn chose this time of all times to be 
disobedient? &quot;We don&#39;t have the time to argue about this; just run, 
okay?!&quot; Venus shouted, the pain of the arrow and the ache of her sore 
muscles forgotten in the midst of the rebellion by the Outer Senshi.

&quot;You&#39;re right; we don&#39;t have the time to argue,&quot; Sailor Saturn 
concurred, apparently agreeing to at least something the Senshi of Love 
said. She walked to the entrance of the T-junction, facing the corridor 
she and Venus had only shortly run down. She twirled her Silence Glaive 
about in both hands, and then levelled it in the direction the youma 
assassins would probably be charging along at any moment. &quot;I shall stay. 
You run,&quot; the Senshi of Death then said firmly, not looking at Sailor 
Venus.

Venus blinked at Saturn, dumbfounded, as the young girl stood in an 
unwavering ready stance, her Glaive aimed down the hallway. She couldn&#39;t 
believe it; Sailor Saturn was trying to steal her thunder! &quot;Saturn, what 
are you doing? You&#39;re perfectly able to run; I&#39;m not. It makes sense for 
me to stay behind,&quot; Venus argued, ignoring the fact that she&#39;d just 
given away her real plan for wanting the Outer Senshi to run ahead.

&quot;No. That is all the more reason for me to stay and allow *you* time to 
run,&quot; the Senshi of Death and Rebirth said determinedly.

&quot;But... but...&quot; Venus spluttered, nearly indignant. Great feats of 
heroism were her thing, not Saturn&#39;s! It was just plain wrong!

Sailor Saturn&#39;s eyelids fell marginally, as if suddenly becoming heavy, 
and her expression turned even more sombre, if that were possible. &quot;This 
is my duty,&quot; she explained softly and slowly. &quot;I am the Sailor Senshi of 
death and rebirth. I symbolise the cycle of Death and Life. All things 
die, but it is my duty to hasten our enemies&#39; inevitable journey into 
Death&#39;s icy embrace, so that they can eventually be reborn and continue 
the never-ending cycle. That is my duty as a Sailor Senshi.&quot;

Sailor Venus was quiet as she digested this information. &quot;But... but 
you&#39;ll die,&quot; she said finally, all thoughts of how heroic a death it 
would be gone from her mind.

&quot;Death cares not from where the lives come, even if it is my own. We are 
all the same when we are in its grasp,&quot; Saturn stated grimly.

While Sailor Venus didn&#39;t like what the Outer Senshi was saying, she 
supposed it was true, at least to some extent. While some deaths where 
better than others, death was still death. The dead couldn&#39;t reap the 
spoils of their sacrifice, no matter how heroic or just. Death is what 
brought all beings down to the same level in the end.

Venus shook her head, shooing away the morbid musings. The noise of the 
youma were so close now, they had to almost be upon them. Any second 
darkly dressed assassins would be tearing down the hallway Saturn was so 
vigilantly watching, or materialising from the shadows. &quot;What about 
Chibi-Usa, Hotaru?&quot; Sailor Venus said quietly, approaching the Senshi of 
Death and Rebirth. &quot;You told her you would be careful... would you 
betray her trust so easily? She would go nuts if she saw what you were 
doing now.&quot;

Sailor Saturn started at the mention of her pink-haired best friend, her 
stance and the impassive mask she wore faltering for a second. &quot;This is 
a battle. She isn&#39;t so na&iuml;ve to believe anyone can avoid danger in a 
situation like this,&quot; she then said, her grim self resurfacing.

Sailor Venus sighed. &quot;I have a duty too, Hotaru,&quot; she said softly, 
nearing the resolute Outer Senshi. &quot;I am the Sailor Senshi of Love and 
Beauty. Love and beauty is what *I* symbolise.&quot; The blonde put a hand on 
Saturn&#39;s shoulder, using her good arm. &quot;And for that reason, I can&#146;t 
abandon you.&quot; Sailor Saturn turned her head towards Sailor Venus, 
confusion now on her features. Venus smiled at her, giving her shoulder 
a small squeeze. &quot;Chibi-Usa would be devastated if anything happened to 
you... and forever unrequited love is the love I hate the most.&quot;

Sailor Saturn&#39;s violet eyes widened at the blonde&#39;s words, her face 
becoming shocked as her stance relaxed. But as quickly as the surprise 
appeared on her features, it was gone, replaced by a joy that the Senshi 
of Love and Beauty delighted in seeing. The shy young girl Venus knew 
shone through the grave exterior of the Senshi of Death and Rebirth, and 
the blonde felt her own smile begin to mirror her friend&#39;s.

&quot;Let&#39;s make our stand together,&quot; Sailor Venus suggested quietly. Sailor 
Saturn nodded firmly, and then took a brief moment to school her happy 
expression to one of grim resolve, her cold mask of Death sliding into 
place once more.

Sailor Venus took several steps back as Sailor Saturn assumed her ready 
position once again, returning her attention to the corridor ahead. 
Venus placed herself behind her fellow senshi, just slightly back from 
the middle of the T-junction of the intersecting hallways. If any youma 
managed to get past the steadfast Senshi of Death, they would have to 
deal with her.

As Sailor Venus and Sailor Saturn watched in alarm and passivity 
respectively, the hallway before them slowly filled with a blanket of 
jet black fog, the dark shadows becoming even darker with the ebony 
vapours. Saturn tightened her hold on her Silence Glaive and tensed in 
front of Venus, set for the coming onslaught. Suddenly, the mists 
coalesced into a host of black clad figures, weapons of all sorts held 
in their grasps. Sailor Venus swallowed hard, the pain in her shoulder 
returning with the sight of the enemy.

Then, all of a sudden, the youma assassins were all over the pair of 
senshi, overrunning their defensive position. Saturn&#39;s Glaive struck out 
unerringly and as ruthlessly as the Reaper&#39;s scythe at the mass of 
assassins, repelling attacks and slaying the attackers with merciless 
precision, her weapon and person becoming soiled with droplets of black 
while the girl herself remained as silent as the grave. But even though 
the Senshi of Death&#39;s assault was formidable and severely damaging to 
the amassed youma, the sheer numbers of the enemy were simply too much 
for her to contain. Several managed to slip past the dark-haired girl&#39;s 
slicing blade and into the T-junction. But Sailor Venus was waiting for 
them.

&quot;CRESCENT BEAM!&quot;

A bolt of searing yellow energy shot out of the index finger of Venus&#39; 
right hand, smashing into a surprised youma assassin&#39;s face behind 
Saturn&#39;s fighting form, leaving a smoking beheaded corpse to fall to the 
floor. More nimble creature&#39;s darted past Sailor Saturn, which Sailor 
Venus quickly fired at, mindful not to strike her companion in the back 
as the beams burst through the enemies&#39; bodies. Some were fast however, 
contorted their bodies to amazing angles, narrowly dodging Venus&#39; 
frantic attacks.

Sailor Venus ducked as one surviving assassin kicked out at her head, 
her long mane of hair instead catching the blow. The youma followed its 
move with lightning speed however, and grabbed the arrow protruding from 
the blonde&#39;s shoulder with one hand, wrenching fiercely on it. Venus 
howled in torment at the mistreatment of her injury, and lashed out with 
a reflexive backhand, knocking the youma&#39;s hand away from the arrow.

&quot;CRESCENT BEAM!&quot;

Sailor Venus blasted her assailant at near point blank range, sending 
its carcass rocketing backwards to crash against the wall, halfway 
buried in the now demolished plaster.

The Senshi of Love kept up her attacks as Sailor Saturn kept up hers, 
but more and more youma started to inundate the blonde&#39;s location. Venus 
gritted her teeth in frustration coupled with desperation as she felled 
yet another assassin, killing it with a shot in the throat just before 
it had the chance to sink a serrated knife into Saturn&#39;s vulnerable 
back. There was just too many of them; she killed one, only to have it 
replaced by another a second later. Where were they all coming from? 
Sailor Saturn couldn&#39;t have been letting *that* many youma past her. 
Venus&#39; eyes scanned the area quickly as she let loose another Crescent 
Beam, scorching a hole though a score of lined up assassins in 
succession. As the now dead group collapsed, the Senshi of Love realised 
with rising dread where all the enemies were coming from.

The shadows that lurked in the two other corridors and even in the 
T-junction itself provided easy means for the youma to bypass the 
daunting Sailor Saturn and strike from the rear... given that they 
manage to deal with Sailor Venus, however. And there was no way the 
Senshi of Love would ever let that happen, not without one serious fight 
anyway.

&quot;LOVE ME CHAIN!&quot;

Sailor Venus grabbed the end of the long chain of hearts that manifested 
around her, and then cracked it like a whip, driving back the gathering 
mass of youma. The golden light that shown brightly from the chain 
chased away the dark shadows around her and Sailor Saturn, banishing 
them from their presence and cutting off the crafty youma enemy&#39;s means 
of stealthy travel.

The Senshi of Love cracked her whip once more, ripping a deep gouge in 
the floor, and then attacked the crowd of assassins before her, tearing 
through many of the creatures&#146; bodies before they knew what was 
happening. Some dived for shadows that were no longer there, and 
promptly paid for their mistake at the hands of Venus. One daring 
assassin grabbed the heart chain as it whizzed by its head, only to have 
its palms seared as the hot, high energy weapon burned though its black 
hand coverings and pale flesh, wisps of smoke wafting off the 
unfortunate creature&#39;s charred appendages.

Soon, with their advantage lost, the youma assassins behind Sailor 
Saturn were beaten back and then down under the relentless hail of 
lashes from Sailor Venus&#39; heart chain whip. Any weapons brought to bear 
against the Senshi of Love were swiftly pulled from the assassins&#39; 
grasps by the glowing whip, and then the defenceless creatures were 
viciously punished for their transgression. Venus&#39; whip cracked once 
more, splitting a youma&#39;s skull in two in a grisly display, before the 
only remaining assassins were the ones currently engaged with Sailor 
Saturn, the rest all gashed, rotting, corpses on the floor around the 
Senshi of Love&#39;s feet.

Sailor Venus turned her attention to Sailor Saturn&#39;s fight, her own 
crisis averted. She saw the Senshi of Death&#39;s Silence Glaive lodge in 
the chest of one foe, causing the unlucky youma to screech out a short 
cry before it cut off in a disgusting burble sound. While Saturn was 
apparently faring fairly well, it was clear that the unremitting, but 
greatly diminished number of youma assassins were taking a toll on her 
energy reserves. It looked like the dark-haired girl would welcome some 
assistance in Venus&#39; opinion.

Letting her heart chain dissipate, Sailor Venus quickly called out 
Saturn&#39;s name, attracting her notice and silently informing the pale 
girl of her intentions before the youma could take advantage of the 
restored shadows. Sailor Saturn&#39;s eyes met the blonde&#39;s for only a split 
second, but the Senshi of Death nodded almost imperceptibly, 
understanding. Abruptly, Saturn darted backwards and then dived down the 
hallway to her left, giving Sailor Venus a clear line of sight towards 
the clustered black swathed enemy.

&quot;VENUS LOVE AND BEAUTY SHOCK!&quot;

Sailor Venus blew a kiss and an orange heart was hurled at the lead 
youma in the middle of the group from her hand, the creatures all 
recklessly stampeding forwards with Sailor Saturn gone. The heart 
smashed into the assassin&#39;s chest and then detonated in a bright orange 
light, slaughtering the entire party in the following explosion, the 
surrounding walls and ceiling of the corridor being totally blown out in 
a shower of debris.

As the dust clouds began to settle, Venus felt her stomach roil as her 
handiwork was revealed littered gorily all over the ruined hallway. She 
swallowed back the nausea and quickly surveyed the place through the 
falling grey dust, making sure all the youma were in fact down for the 
count permanently.

&quot;A kiss of death,&quot; Sailor Venus punned in a whisper, seeing that none of 
the youma had escaped the lethal blast.

A small sound of agreement came from the Senshi of Love&#39;s left, and a 
rather battered looking Sailor Saturn stepped beside her. Black fluid 
liberally graced the Outer Senshi&#39;s once white fuku, making the girl&#39;s 
appearance in the floating dust and dark shadows of the hallway sinister 
indeed. Saturn took a sharp swipe with her blood splattered Silence 
Glaive, casually flicking off some of the thick liquid from the weapon&#39;s 
blade onto the walls and floor, before bringing it up in an upright 
position next to her.

&quot;We should do something about that arrow now,&quot; Sailor Saturn said in a 
nonchalant tone, turning her head to the injured Venus, as if the pair 
hadn&#39;t been butchering youma only a few moments earlier. &quot;It could get 
infected.&quot;

Sailor Venus looked at Sailor Saturn&#39;s impassive blood streaked face and 
simply stared at her for a second. She then closed her eyes and shook 
her head at the Outer Senshi&#39;s unflappable behaviour. But before the 
blonde could nod in concurrence, she heard a crunching sound come from 
the destroyed corridor. Both Venus and Saturn quickly returned their 
attention to the hallway as a lone slim figure stepped from the darkness 
and through the nearly settled dust, kicking up small puffs of grey 
powder in their wake.

&quot;Well, well, such an impressive exhibition of power,&quot; said the 
approaching figure in a condescending voice. &quot;I had heard Death had 
entered this place, and I was anxious to meet the human who the other 
pathetic youma harbour such fear for...&quot;

The lithe figure was feminine in form, Sailor Venus saw, and dressed 
like Rei when she was at the Hikawa Jinja, but instead of her clothing 
being red and white, it was pure black. Venus wasn&#39;t surprised of the 
colour choice in the slightest; the youma really had to get a fashion 
consultant as soon as possible. The youma&#39;s head was completely 
uncovered by veil or bandage or hood, unlike the others of her kind, 
exposing a very pale and human-like face framed by soft, straight, 
shoulder length lilac hair with the tips of long, pointed ears poking 
through the tresses. Her eyes were pools of jade; an extremely vivid 
shade of green that shone in the darkness like a cat&#39;s. Like a 
predator&#39;s.

But the feature that stood out the most on the youma was the extremely 
long, solid, wooden pole that the creature rested over one shoulder. At 
least a foot long curved steel blade was attached to the top of the 
pole, its single sharpened edge appearing exceptionally intimidating to 
Sailor Venus. One good hit with that weapon and she was sure she would 
be cleaved in half like butter being cut through by a knife. The Senshi 
of Love gulped as her gaze continued to study the weapon similar to 
Saturn&#39;s Glaive, her blue eyes held spellbound to the foreboding sight.

&quot;Naginata...&quot; Sailor Saturn murmured next to Sailor Venus, inclining her 
head in the direction of the youma&#39;s weapon. The Senshi of Death altered 
her grip on her Silence Glaive as her violet eyes narrowed at the 
apparently naginata-wielding creature; the enemy&#39;s weapon so like her 
own.

The youma lifted her weapon off her shoulder and brought it into a 
horizontal position with both hands, the blade directed at Sailor 
Saturn. A confident smirk pulled up one side of the assassin&#39;s mouth. &quot;I 
see you are but a child. Hmm... come then, young one, let our blades 
meet and the clash of steel on steel ring out!&quot;

The assassin screamed a battle cry and charged forwards, letting her 
naginata lead the way. Sailor Venus jumped hastily back as Sailor Saturn 
swung her Silence Glaive around in circles above her head, giving the 
Senshi of Death space to manoeuvre as the sharp ornate blade nearly 
scalped the blonde. Just when the youma was practically upon her, Saturn 
stuck suddenly downwards with her weapon, smashing the assassin&#39;s fast 
approaching naginata away from her body and into the floor. The Outer 
Senshi swiftly followed her move with a smooth swipe using the end of 
her Glaive at her assailant&#39;s head, forcing the youma to duck and then 
hop backwards, pulling her naginata free from the floor. Sailor Saturn 
slashed diagonally upwards in a gutting carve at the retreating 
assassin, but only met air as the youma dropped into a crouch and swung 
at the Senshi of Death&#39;s legs, attempting to trip the girl with her 
weapon&#39;s shaft. Saturn skipped over the naginata nimbly and stabbed the 
butt of her Silence Glaive into the forehead of the squatting youma as 
she came down, knocking the creature&#39;s head back and depositing her on 
her backside. The youma rolled backwards, being forced to drop her 
naginata on the floor as Sailor Saturn hacked at her susceptible body, 
nearly caving in her skull, but instead implanting her curved blade 
firmly into the floor. The black swathed assassin slipped her foot under 
the wooden shaft of her naginata and flicked the pole weapon upwards, 
before snatching it out of the air. Saturn tugged hard on her Silence 
Glaive, but realising the weapon wasn&#39;t budging, the Senshi of Death 
immediately took a step back then jumped at the nearly vertical metal 
shaft, grabbing it with both hands and swinging her body around straight 
at the recovered youma, ramming her feet into the creature&#39;s chest. The 
assassin staggered backwards from the blow, granting Saturn enough time 
to wrench the now loosened Glaive free from the floor as she swung 
around a second time. The two combatants struck out at each other at the 
same time, the shafts of their weapons colliding with a dull bang. 
Sailor Saturn and the youma abruptly burst into whirlwinds of motion, 
striking out with both ends of their pole weapons like staffs, sparks 
flying when the two curved blades met. Every attack Saturn made was 
instantly countered by the skilled assassin and visa versa, neither 
getting the upper hand as both fighters moved fluidly together, 
displaying an amazing display of speed and agility, providing a wondrous 
show for the audience consisting solely of Sailor Venus. That is, if the 
Senshi of Love wasn&#39;t scared out of her wits each time the dark-haired 
friend only narrowly deflected yet another attack from the proficient 
youma.

Sailor Venus watched anxiously as Sailor Saturn did battle with the 
assassin, unsure of what to do. The fighting between the pair was so 
fast and furious that the blonde had trouble merely following the 
combat; the elegance and sheer number of flawless moves chained together 
by Saturn and the youma were simply mind-blowing. However, in closely 
scrutinising the Senshi of Death&#39;s fighting style, Venus only now 
realised that something was different from the last time she had seen 
the girl in battle. Sailor Saturn fought like someone who wanted to 
live, not with the cold accuracy and perfect efficiency of a detached 
killing machine, but with the heated passion and resolute spirit of a 
warrior who fought for a worthy cause they believed completely in. Her 
expression was as grim and serious as ever, but the pale girl&#39;s eyes 
were no longer devoid of life. Venus had too look hard to see it, but 
there was a fire behind those violet eyes, a fire that fuelled the Outer 
Senshi&#39;s attacks and granted them a flair that icy precision couldn&#39;t 
provide. It was obvious to Sailor Venus that this change bestowed a vast 
improvement to Sailor Saturn&#39;s combat technique, allowing her to preform 
more combinations based on initiative, rather than technical skill.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you... channel some of that... fire I hear you have?&quot; the 
youma assassin forced out through clenched teeth, the strain of the 
unrelenting and highly competent attacks from Sailor Saturn showing on 
the creature&#39;s face.

Saturn said nothing in return to the youma&#39;s strange request, merely 
continuing to keep up with blocking the series of strikes from her 
opponent, searching for a break in the assassin&#39;s defence. Sweat 
trickled down the youma&#39;s face as the Senshi of Death&#39;s Silence Glaive 
cracked once again against her naginata, the power of the hit jarring 
the creature&#39;s arms painfully. The youma leapt backwards, out of range 
of Saturn&#39;s Glaive and ceasing the test of dexterity and skill that she 
would surely eventually lose. The assassin spun her naginata above her 
head in fast rotations, the weapon becoming a total blur.

&quot;Now we finish this!&quot; the youma snarled, the speed of the spinning 
naginata creating air currents that blew up the dust around her. The 
sound of the whirling weapon made threatening swooping noises that 
filled the hallway, but Sailor Saturn merely scowled at the assassin&#39;s 
performance, clearly not impressed at all. &quot;DIE HUMAN!!&quot; the youma 
suddenly howled, altering her grip to prepare to slash at Saturn in a 
fatal horizontal chop backed by unstoppable power.

&quot;CRESCENT BEAM!&quot;

There was a crash as an unidentifiable object flew off from above the 
youma&#39;s head and banged against a wall. The assassin blinked in 
confusion at the sudden loss of momentum in her naginata spin, and 
lowered the weapon. Her eyes widened to nearly the size of saucers as 
she saw the splintered broken shaft of the weapon, the other half of the 
bladed wooden pole having been shot off by Sailor Venus&#39; well-timed 
energy attack.

&quot;Wha...?&quot; the youma said weakly, totally stupefied at what had happened 
to her once formidable weapon.

&quot;No one just ignores me like some nobody and gets away with it!&quot; Sailor 
Venus declared to the stunned assassin, wagging a pointed finger back 
and forth while she shook her head in chastisement.

The youma spluttered indignantly for several seconds, before the words 
finally managed to form. &quot;But-- but-- but this isn&#39;t *FAIR!* This isn&#39;t 
f-- GARK!&quot; Sailor Saturn&#39;s Silence Glaive sunk deeply into the 
assassin&#39;s skull and abruptly cut off her incensed protestations, the 
curved blade cleaving through bone nearly down to her jaw. The ill-fated 
youma dropped to the floor, the Glaive still embedded firmly in her 
cranium and face.

Sailor Saturn put one booted foot against the dead assassin&#39;s chest and 
pulled hard on her trapped Silence Glaive, attempting to free it from 
the cracked bone that held it. After the fifth tug, the blade finally 
came free, sending a spray of black blood and brain matter flying 
obscenely to splat against the already dirty walls.

&quot;Oh, god, that&#39;s disgusting,&quot; Venus commented in a breath as she sat 
tiredly down on the floor, grimacing as the arrow stuck in her shoulder 
vibrated.

Saturn made a noncommittal sound and then walked up to the blonde and 
sat next to her, placing her soiled Silence Glaive on the floor beside 
her. She gingerly prodded a spot near Sailor Venus&#39; arrow wound with a 
finger, eliciting a sharp intake of breath and a mild verbal reprimand 
from the Inner Senshi, causing the young girl to quickly pull her 
exploring finger back and apologise.

&quot;It&#39;s going to be hard to get it out,&quot; Saturn informed Venus after 
looking at the arrow from all angles.

Just as Sailor Venus was about to enlighten the Senshi of Rebirth about 
her acute dislike for pain, there was the noise of heavy footfalls from 
the undamaged hallway to their left. Venus and Saturn looked at one 
another, both silently praying that it wasn&#39;t yet another youma out for 
their blood, and then hurriedly climbed to their feet, the Outer Senshi 
retrieving her Glaive as she did so.

&quot;Saturn! Thank god, I was hoping that those noises would lead me to 
you!&quot; Tuxedo Kamen said with relief while he rearranged his hold on 
Sailor Neptune in his arms. The aquamarine-haired woman eyes were shut 
and she appeared very pale and drawn out; it was apparent to Sailor 
Venus that something was seriously wrong with her. The Senshi of Love&#39;s 
first guess was the blood soaked clump of rags around Neptune&#39;s left 
thigh.

&quot;Michiru-mama!&quot; Sailor Saturn wailed at the sight of one of her 
guardians in need of immediate medical attention, the dark-haired girl 
dropping her Silence Glaive and her emotionless mask, before running 
over to the woman. It seemed that Saturn&#39;s philosophies about Death and 
Rebirth didn&#39;t extend to her family. Or her friends.

Sailor Venus sat back down on the floor as Tuxedo Kamen lay Sailor 
Neptune carefully on the floor while Sailor Saturn hovered frantically 
above the Senshi of the Ocean, plainly disconcerted. At least there were 
four of them now, despite Neptune&#39;s obvious crippled state. Venus was 
confident that Saturn would use her innate healing ability to patch the 
woman up, however. And then it would be her turn to get nursed back to 
health. Sailor Venus was certainly not looking forward to getting that 
arrow ripped out of her shoulder. As Sailor Saturn gently removed the 
makeshift bandages from Sailor Neptune&#39;s leg, Sailor Venus wondered 
where Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Jupiter and Sailor Mercury were. 
Hopefully they weren&#39;t experiencing what she, Saturn, Neptune and Tuxedo 
Kamen were suffering though. Sailor Venus had known that coming to this 
skyscraper was a bad idea.
