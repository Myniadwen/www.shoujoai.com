	Ken squinted in confusion at the voice on the other end of the 
phone.  He was used to being pulled out of bed at three in the morning, 
but at least his messenger service knew better than to throw cryptic 
phrases at him right after he said hello.
	Slowly sitting up, he reached for the light beside the bed.  
&#147;Kaya, is that you?&#148; he asked groggily.
	&#147;Yes, it&#146;s me,&#148; came a frazzled sounding response.  &#147;She&#146;s pacing, 
Ken.  Ami doesn&#146;t pace.  She isn&#146;t that high strung.&#148;
	Ken brought a hand up and scrubbed at his face, the early morning 
stubble on his cheeks abrasive against his palm.  &#147;Kaya,&#148; he said 
patiently, &#147;stop moving.&#148;
	There was a pause on Kaya&#146;s end as Ken imagined the sudden halt 
in her own pacing.  He heard an annoyed grunt, and then, &#147;I hate you.&#148;
	Ken smiled.  &#147;I know.  Now take a deep breath.&#148;  When he heard 
Kaya exhale, he said, &#147;Now sit down and tell me what&#146;s wrong.&#148;
	Kaya did as she was told.  When she began to speak, her voice 
held a weariness Ken wasn&#146;t used to hearing from her.  &#147;I made Ami stay 
home tonight.  After what happened at the hospital, I thought it would 
be best if Ami put some distance between herself and Makoto.  She 
didn&#146;t argue with me at all, only asked if she could say goodnight.  
But when I went back to get her, something was wrong.  She said Makoto 
went to bed before she could say goodnight to her, and then all she did 
was wring her hands and fidget for the whole ride home.  When we got 
back here, she went upstairs to go to bed, but she&#146;s done nothing but 
pace back and forth for most of the night.  She keeps stepping on the 
same loose board every sixth step.&#148;  Kaya sighed, sounding like she was 
on the verge of tears herself.  &#147;I just want to keep her from getting 
hurt, Ken, and now I think I&#146;ve only made things worse.&#148;
	At that moment, Ken wished he was there to hold her.  Putting as 
much comfort and strength into his voice as he could, he said, &#147;You&#146;re 
doing the best you know how to for her, Kaya.  She&#146;ll understand that 
someday, even if she doesn&#146;t now.  But you can&#146;t protect her from 
everything,&#148; he said gently.  &#147;No matter how hard we try, sometimes 
they&#146;re still going to get hurt.&#148;
	&#147;I know, but I have to try,&#148; answered Kaya.  &#147;I saw all those 
girls in the waiting room this afternoon, and I was amazed.  It&#146;s rare 
that I get to see them all at once, and there they were because they 
were all concerned for Makoto.  But in all of this, who&#146;s worrying 
about Ami?&#148;
	&#147;Have you tried talking to her about it?&#148;
	&#147;I don&#146;t know how to,&#148; admitted Kaya, the frustration she felt 
creeping into her voice.  &#147;She hasn&#146;t come to me about any of it, and 
until recently, I was perfectly willing to let her take it at her own 
pace.  You have to understand, Ami was somewhat of a late bloomer.  She 
was always so shy about things, and terribly embarrassed about anything 
that had to do with sexuality.  When she was younger, I tried to have a 
talk with her about it.  She was always getting into my medical 
journals and asking questions about the material, so I didn&#146;t think it 
would be a problem.  I was certain she already knew the basics, anyway.  
But as soon as I started speaking, her eyes hit the floor and she 
turned bright red.  For days after that she avoided me.  I finally 
pulled her into the kitchen and forced her to bake cookies.  There&#146;s a 
precision to it, mixed in with just a bit of experimentation, that 
appeals to her nature.  She&#146;s enjoyed doing it ever since she was old 
enough to stand at the counter and help mix the dough.  Somehow, though, 
I don&#146;t think baking cookies is going to help this time.&#148;


*            *            *

	Rei flipped over onto her stomach with a definite lack of grace.  
Her face burrowed into the pillow as one arm was flung over the back of 
the couch.  She growled in annoyance as her legs tangled in the 
blankets Makoto had given her.  Without lifting her head, Rei tried to 
reach behind her to pull at the blanket, but could only brush it with 
her fingers.  With another annoyed growl, she started to roll to the 
side to see if she could get a better grip and&#133;
	&#147;Son of a&#133;&#148; cursed Rei as her back encountered nothing but air.  
As she went over the edge of the couch, her arms flailed and her elbow 
impacted with the coffee table.  Holding her arm against her, her eyes 
squeezed shut and watering, Rei let loose with a string of curses that 
did her title of Sailor proud.
	After a few minutes, Rei took a deep breath, rubbed hard at the 
spot she was sure would have a bruise by morning, and then began to 
untangle the blankets from her trapped legs.  &#147;How does Ami do this 
every night?&#148; she asked herself as she pulled at her makeshift bindings.
	When she leaned forward to pull at the fabric around her feet, 
Rei went far enough to see around the edge of the couch.  She scooted 
forward onto her hands and knees and stared in confusion at the light 
coming from under the kitchen door.  &#147;I know that wasn&#146;t on when I went 
to bed,&#148; she said.  Then she looked up at the clock and her expression 
changed.  With a shrug, she muttered, &#147;Guess I got some sleep after all.  
Oh, well.  Might as well go see what&#146;s going on.  Beats sitting here 
talking to myself.&#148;
	When she entered the kitchen, Rei found Makoto at the table 
snacking on a jar of peanut butter.  Rei wrinkled her nose at the sight.
	Makoto smiled and held up the jar.  &#147;Want some?&#148; she asked, 
knowing full well what Rei&#146;s response would be.  Then threw in for good 
measure, &#147;It&#146;s extra chunky.&#148;
	Rei grimaced.  &#147;Ugh.  No thanks.&#148;  She took a seat on one of the 
stools by the breakfast counter.  &#147;You could at least make a sandwich 
out of that, you know.&#148;
	Makoto shook her head as she swallowed another spoonful.  &#147;Nope.  
It&#146;s better straight.&#148;
	&#147;If you say so,&#148; replied Rei, not at all understanding Makoto&#146;s 
fascination with the substance.  Then, wondering why the other girl was 
up so late, asked, &#147;Are you feeling okay?&#148;
	&#147;Yeah,&#148; answered Makoto.  &#147;I was just thinking about some things 
and couldn&#146;t stop long enough to fall asleep.&#148;  She stuck the spoon in 
the jar and slowly stirred it around.  &#147;I&#146;m sorry if I woke you up.&#148;
	&#147;You didn&#146;t,&#148; said Rei with a shake of her head.  She smirked 
when she remember just what had woken her up.  &#147;I was having trouble 
sleeping myself.  No offense, Mako-chan, but your couch isn&#146;t the 
easiest place to sleep.  I was just thinking before I came in here that 
I don&#146;t know how Ami does it every night.&#148;
	Makoto frowned at the mention of Ami&#146;s name.  For a moment, her 
eyes dropped from Rei&#146;s.  When she raised them a second later, Rei 
could see a difference.  A wall had dropped, and there was a sadness 
there that ran deeper than anything she&#146;d sensed before in this girl.  
The sensation it caused in her own soul left her with a chill.
	Makoto took in a slow breath.  Upon releasing it, she said, &#147;I 
was just sitting here thinking I don&#146;t know *why* Ami does it.&#148;
	Rei hesitated.  Then, very cautiously, she said.  &#147;She&#146;s your 
friend.  She does it because she cares about you.&#148;
	&#147;Right.  She cares,&#148; replied Makoto.  She turned away from Rei 
and rested her chin against her arms on the tabletop.  &#147;She cares about 
me, and I&#146;ve done nothing but hurt her.  Yet, she still cares, and 
she&#146;s still here.  And she hates us both for it,&#148; finished Makoto with 
a sad sigh.
	Rei fixed Makoto with a scrutinizing stare.  &#147;You heard what she 
said tonight, didn&#146;t you?&#148;
	&#147;I wasn&#146;t trying to eavesdrop,&#148; answered Makoto.  &#147;I just wanted 
to get a light bulb for Minako.  Then I heard Ami&#146;s voice, and she 
sounded so upset.  I needed to know why, and I knew she wouldn&#146;t tell 
me because she already thinks I&#146;m too stressed out.&#148;  Makoto made a 
sound that under other circumstances would have been a laugh.  &#147;But I 
suppose that&#146;s not why she wasn&#146;t telling me, is it?&#148;
	Well, now she knew why Makoto had gone to bed without saying 
goodnight to them.  Rei released a long sigh and ran a hand through her 
hair.  &#147;Just perfect,&#148; she mumbled to herself.  Then to Makoto she said, 
&#147;Look, Mako-chan, what she said&#133;  She just needed to blow off some 
steam.  Ami&#146;s been holding it in for a long time.  She can&#146;t help how 
she feels, you know, and she&#146;s always so careful about it.  Today was 
just too much for her.  But she&#146;s still your friend.  She always will 
be, no matter what.  Her feelings won&#146;t get in the way of that.  They 
just sort of complicate things.&#148;
	Makoto shook her head.  &#147;That isn&#146;t it, Rei.  It doesn&#146;t bother 
me that she has feelings for me.  What bothers me is that I never knew.  
All I&#146;ve ever wanted to do was protect her from this, and because I 
didn&#146;t see it happening, she got hurt.&#148;  Makoto&#146;s voice turned a bit 
wistful.  &#147;I care for her more than I&#146;ve ever cared for anyone.  I wish 
I had known.&#148;
	&#147;Mako-chan,&#148; said Rei hesitantly, &#147;the way you&#146;re talking, it 
almost sounds like&#133;&#148;
	&#147;Rei,&#148; said Makoto, cutting off the other girl.  She lifted her 
head from her arms, looked right into Rei&#146;s eyes, and took one of the 
biggest steps of her life.  &#147;I&#146;m gay.&#148;
	Rei&#146;s mouth fell open as she gaped at the other girl.  Finally 
she blurted out, &#147;Since when?&#148;
	Makoto smirked.  &#147;Since I was thirteen and realized I was having 
a better time watching the cheerleaders and their pompoms than I was 
watching the basketball team.  The boys&#146; team, anyway.  The girls&#146; team 
was another story.  But there were never any cheerleaders at those 
games.  Guess they thought there was enough fan service on the court,&#148; 
concluded Makoto with a shrug.
	Rei just sat there shaking her head.  She brought a hand up over 
her eyes and rubbed at her temples.  &#147;I don&#146;t believe this,&#148; she said 
mostly to herself.  &#147;And after all this&#133;&#148;  Then she moved her hand away 
and looked at Makoto.  &#147;Why didn&#146;t you ever say anything?&#148;
	Makoto couldn&#146;t stop the bitterness she felt rising in her, and 
it was evident in her voice as she spoke.  &#147;After everything the four 
of you said to me, how can you even ask that?&#148;
	&#147;We never talked about any of this in front of you,&#148; said Rei 
defensively, realizing belatedly that she was admitting to all their 
gossip.
	Makoto&#146;s chuckle was a less than pleasant sound.  &#147;No, I suppose 
you didn&#146;t.  Do you really not remember?&#148;
	Rei shook her head helplessly.
	&#147;&#146;Don&#146;t give up, Mako-chan,&#146;&#148; said Makoto, pulling up the old 
memory.  &#147;&#146;There are still plenty of cute guys out there.&#146;  The four of 
you falling all over each other and saying what a huge problem it was 
that I might have a crush on another girl.  And Usagi.  I can&#146;t tell 
you how many times she told me I shouldn&#146;t because Haruka was a girl.&#148;
	&#147;Oh,&#148; answered Rei, suddenly feeling very guilty, &#147;that.&#148;
	&#147;Yeah, that,&#148; answered Makoto.  &#147;After all of that, do you really 
expect that I would have said anything to you about it?&#148;
	&#147;I guess you wouldn&#146;t,&#148; replied Rei.
	&#147;And believe me, the irony in our situations isn&#146;t lost on me, 
either,&#148; added Makoto.  &#147;Seeing as how I&#146;m not the one who gave up on 
boys.&#148;
	Rei blushed at that.  Wanting to get the conversation away from 
herself, she leaned back against the counter and put her hands behind 
her head to stretch.  &#147;So,&#148; she said almost absently, &#147;you really did 
have a crush on Haruka, huh?&#148;
	&#147;Maybe a little,&#148; admitted Makoto.  Reaching for the peanut 
butter and then toying absently with the spoon, she added, &#147;But that 
wasn&#146;t all of it.  Back then, and even now though not as much, Haruka 
seemed like the perfect person to me.  She was beautiful, talented, and 
not only had she accepted who and what she was, but she had embraced it.  
She was everything I wanted to be, and I just wanted to be around her 
for a while.  Like maybe if I could be near her, I&#146;d figure things out 
for myself.&#148;
	&#147;They did seem perfect, didn&#146;t they?&#148; said Rei.  She chuckled 
lightly.  &#147;I remember when Ami finally said what we&#146;d all been thinking.  
That maybe they really were together like that.  It seemed so strange, 
yet they looked so right together.  We just weren&#146;t used to that sort 
of thing, I guess.  Maybe that&#146;s why we talked about it so much when 
you went off with her.&#148;
	Rei smiled ruefully at the look Makoto shot her, then said, &#147;Yeah, 
we talked about you.  I wouldn&#146;t think you&#146;d be surprised to find that 
out.  But just so you know, Ami never had anything to do with it.  She 
actually yelled at us for it once.  Literally raised her voice and told 
us we didn&#146;t have our priorities in order.  Then the rest of the time 
she would hide behind a book and pretend she wasn&#146;t listening.  That 
was when I figured it out.  Poor thing didn&#146;t know what to deny harder.  
That she was in love with you or that she was actually interested in 
our gossip.&#148;
	Makoto watched her spoon as she drew figure eights in the peanut 
butter.  &#147;I&#146;m glad she had you to talk to, at least.&#148;
	Rei moved off the stool and went to sit beside Makoto.  She 
rested a hand on the other girl&#146;s arm, hoping Makoto would accept what 
she was offering.
	Makoto smiled at her friend.  Folding her arms, she rested her 
chin on them once again.  &#147;It wasn&#146;t just you guys, you know,&#148; she said 
as she stared at some invisible spot on the wall.  &#147;I wasn&#146;t 
comfortable feeling like that, never was.  It went so against 
everything I was supposed to want.  I mean, the princess is supposed to 
fall in love with a prince, not one of her ladies in waiting.&#148;
	Makoto laid her head so she was facing Rei, and the other girl 
imitated the position.  Right then, they looked like nothing more than 
two children with their heads together and trading secrets.
	&#147;When I was little,&#148; went on Makoto, &#147;my mom would tell me about 
how she and my dad met and fell in love.  It was this incredible fairy 
tale to me, and I always wanted one just like it.  Dad would call me 
his princess, and Mom would tell me about all the wonderful things that 
would happen when I was grown up and met a young man just like my daddy.  
My prince.  Then, when I began to understand some of the things I was 
feeling, I could sense it all slipping away from me.&#148;  Makoto blew air 
out between her lips in remembered frustration.
	&#147;I didn&#146;t want to lose my happily-ever-after,&#148; she went on.  &#147;And 
I didn&#146;t want to be any different than I already was.  So I did 
everything I could to ignore it.  I decided I wasn&#146;t going to wait for 
my prince to come to me, I was going to go to him.  When he told me I 
wasn&#146;t feminine enough to appeal to any guys, I decided to become the 
perfect ideal of feminine.  Or at least I tried to.  I thought if I 
could do that, and if I was patient enough, one of those frogs I always 
seemed to be kissing would turn into my prince.  Then he would kiss me 
back, say he loved me, and we would ride off into the sunset together 
amid cheers from all our friends and a bunch of little woodland 
creatures,&#148; she finished with a self-depreciating smirk.
	Rei, sensing she had permission, returned the smirk with one of 
her own.  &#147;Mako-chan, you do know that&#146;s not how it really works?  Not 
even in the fairy tales.&#148;
	Makoto thought briefly on her own princess and all the things 
she&#146;d been through to be with her prince.  &#147;Yeah,&#148; she answered, &#147;I 
figured that out after a while.  Didn&#146;t stop me from trying to find it, 
though.&#148;
	Leaning in closer, Rei touched her forehead to Makoto&#146;s.  After a 
moment, she pulled back a bit, a grin on her face.  &#147;And you really 
have a thing for Ami?&#148; she asked in a tell-me-a-secret tone.
	Makoto mirrored Rei&#146;s grin.  &#147;Since the first time I saw her,&#148; 
she answered.  &#147;But Usagi was the only person at school who wasn&#146;t 
afraid to talk to me.  I wasn&#146;t going to mess that up by hitting on one 
of her friends.  It wasn&#146;t easy, though, because when I saw Ami, she 
was just so&#133;&#148;  Makoto trailed off into an appreciative sigh.
	Rei looked just a bit confused at this.  &#147;I remember when we met, 
Mako-chan.  It was that boy you went chasing after, not Ami.&#148;
	Makoto shook her head a bit.  &#147;He reminded me of my sempai and 
was a good distraction.  Believe me, I was grateful for it at the time.  
Later, though, when it was all over and I was alone, I didn&#146;t think 
there was going to be enough cold water in all of Tokyo to make the 
image I had of her go away.  Because in that first moment when I saw 
her, Ami was just like this living, breathing schoolgirl fantasy.&#148;  
Makoto&#146;s eyes became unfocused and faraway as she called up that first 
impression.  In her voice were hints of longing and awe.  &#147;I remember 
this adorable girl was standing there in her perfectly pressed uniform, 
holding her little black cat, and her mouth was formed into this 
perfect, tiny &#147;o&#148;.  She had a light blush going across her cheeks, and 
her eyes&#133;  Kami, those eyes.  If she&#146;d have been wearing her glasses I 
don&#146;t think I would have survived it.  And then when Usagi told me Ami 
was the shy, genius type, it&#133; just&#133; Rei?&#148;
	Rei&#146;s face was screwed up into an uncomfortable looking half grin.  
Her right eye had acquired a slow tick, and she was looking right 
through Makoto to something only she could see.  Makoto waved her hand 
in front of Rei&#146;s eyes and said her name several times before Rei 
finally snapped out of it.
	With a jump that almost knocked her chair backwards, Rei 
refocused on the girl in front of her.  She glared accusatorily at 
Makoto.  &#147;Okay, thanks to you I now have a mental image of Ami that I 
never EVER wanted.&#148;
	&#147;But it&#146;s a nice image, isn&#146;t it?&#148; said Makoto mischievously.
	&#147;That is entirely beside the point!&#148; returned Rei.  She shuddered 
for emphasis, then took a deep breath and tried desperately to get this 
newest image out of her head.  &#147;Urrgg&#133; I swear, the two of you are 
perfect for each other,&#148; she said in annoyance.  &#147;When you talk to her, 
be sure and tell her that part about the schoolgirl thing.  She&#146;ll 
appreciate it.&#148;
	Makoto blanched.  &#147;I can&#146;t tell her.  Neither can you.&#148;
	Rei waved a hand dismissively at Makoto.  &#147;Trust me.  And 
remember to ask her the part about you petting Luna,&#148; she said with a 
laugh.
	Makoto shook her head.  &#147;What?  No, that&#146;s not what I mean.  You 
can&#146;t tell her anything about what I just said.  Any of it.  And 
neither can I.&#148;
	&#147;Why the hell not?&#148; questioned Rei, more confused than ever now.  
&#147;I though you were in love with her.&#148;
	&#147;I am,&#148; answered Makoto.
	&#147;So, then, what&#146;s the problem?&#148;
	&#147;Weren&#146;t you listening when she was speaking to you?&#148; asked 
Makoto as if the answer were obvious.  &#147;She hates me.  And she hates 
herself for ever having loved me after everything I&#146;ve put her 
through.&#148;  She frowned and looked down at her fidgeting fingers.  &#147;You 
know, I kind of thought she was happy about the baby.  But then, I&#146;ve 
spent four years completely misunderstanding everything she was trying 
to tell me.  Why should this be any different?&#148;
	Rei made several noises that were a cross between annoyed and 
confused.  &#147;What are you talking about?&#148; she asked.  &#147;I thought you 
said you were eavesdropping.&#148;
	Makoto looked back up at her.  &#147;I was.  She said she hated 
herself, and then started crying, and I couldn&#146;t take anymore.  Then 
Minako came back into the room, and I had to deal with her.&#148;
	Rei threw her hands up, completely exasperated with this girl.  
&#147;Ya know, Mako-chan, if you&#146;re going to listen in on other people&#146;s 
conversations, you really should stick around for the whole thing.  Ami 
doesn&#146;t hate you.  For whatever reason, her idea of perfect is being 
here with you, changing diapers and getting up at three am with a 
screaming infant.  That&#146;s what she wants, even if she is a bit annoyed 
with you for not figuring it out on your own.&#148;
	&#147;Really?&#148; asked Makoto quietly, for the first time feeling some 
real hope.
	Rei nodded.  &#147;Yes, really.&#148;
	Makoto&#146;s mind ran down the list of doubts she still held.  &#147;I&#146;d 
be asking her to accept an awful lot, even if it is what she thinks she 
wants.  It wouldn&#146;t be fair to do that to her.&#148;
	&#147;I think it&#146;s a lot more unfair of you not to tell her,&#148; answered 
Rei.  &#147;Because by not telling her, you&#146;re taking away her choices.  And 
since you get one, she deserves one, too.  Not to mention that it&#146;s 
supremely unfair of you to let her go on loving you and thinking she&#146;s 
not being loved in return.&#148;
	&#147;She loves me,&#148; said Makoto, a silly grin spreading across her 
face.  &#147;I never really thought&#133;&#148;
	Rei smiled as the darkness lifted from around Makoto.  &#147;Yes, she 
loves you.  And she never really thought either.  You&#146;re going to talk 
to her, right?&#148; pressed Rei.
	Makoto nodded.  &#147;Yeah.  Tomorrow.  She&#146;s spending the night.&#148;


*            *            *

	Having completely given up on the couch, Rei was spread out on 
the floor, arms and legs akimbo.  She blew at her bangs, their movement 
over her forehead the only amusement she could find at this hour.  At 
least, she thought to herself, she wasn&#146;t the only one not getting any 
sleep tonight.  Rei was pretty sure that at least two of the others 
were suffering as well.
	&#147;But at least they get to suffer in their own beds,&#148; she said as 
she gave one final, long exhale.
	Turning onto her side, Rei propped her head up on her hand.  She 
reached over to her bag with her other hand and fished around for 
several seconds until she encountered the object she was looking for.  
Pulling out her communicator, she played her fingers over it for 
several seconds before finally activating it.
	As she waited for the call to be answered, Rei sat up and leaned 
against the couch.  After a few minutes, the viewscreen activated and a 
sleepy, disheveled blonde head popped into view.
	&#147;I&#146;m up, I&#146;m up,&#148; said Minako groggily.  Her eyes were only half 
open, and her words were sleepy-slurred when she asked, &#147;Who&#146;s 
attacking now?  It better not be that kid again.  Ack!&#148;
	The viewscreen tumbled along with Minako as she tripped.  In the 
background, Rei heard Artemis yelp in pain.  When Minako&#146;s head came 
back into view, the blonde was gingerly rubbing a spot on the top of 
her head.  &#147;Where do I need to meet you guys?&#148; she asked.
	Rei held back a laugh.  &#147;We&#146;re not being attacked, Minako.  You 
don&#146;t need to meet us anywhere.&#148;
	Minako&#146;s features went slack as she frowned in confusion.  &#147;Then 
why&#146;d you call me?&#148;
	&#147;I can&#146;t sleep, and I&#146;m bored,&#148; answered Rei.  Then she frowned.  
&#147;And I have this image stuck in my head that I can&#146;t make go away.&#148;
	&#147;Rei,&#148; whined Minako, &#147;it&#146;s 4:30 in the morning.  If the sun 
isn&#146;t up yet, I don&#146;t want to be either.&#148;
	With a smirk, Rei replied, &#147;You&#146;ve never complained about it 
before.&#148;
	&#147;Only because you were right there next to me,&#148; returned Minako, 
her scowl turning into a sleepy grin.  She rubbed at her eyes and moved 
up onto the bed.  Lying on her stomach with her head propped on her 
hands and her communicator upright in front of her, she asked, &#147;So 
what&#146;s this image?  I assume that&#146;s what you want to talk about.&#148;
	Rei shook her head violently.  &#147;Uhn uhn.  I want to make it go 
away, not relive it.  Talk to me.  I don&#146;t care about what so long as 
it isn&#146;t that.&#148;
	Minako thought for a moment, blowing little puffs of air between 
her lips as she did.  Finally she said, &#147;I think Mako-chan heard you 
and Ami talking earlier.&#148;
	Rei nearly glared at her.  &#147;Why didn&#146;t you tell me that before 
you left?&#148;
	Unperturbed, Minako shrugged.  &#147;I wasn&#146;t sure.  I mean, this is 
Ami we&#146;re talking about.  She&#146;s never said a bad thing about anyone in 
her life.  But Mako-chan seemed upset about it.  Did she say anything 
to you about it?&#148;
	&#147;Mako-chan said a lot of things to me,&#148; answered Rei with a sigh.
	When she realized Rei wasn&#146;t going to elaborate any further, 
Minako said, &#147;You&#146;re not going to tell me anything, are you?&#148;
	Rei shook her head.
	&#147;Fine,&#148; answered Minako.  She turned over onto her back so all 
Rei could see on her communicator was the top of Minako&#146;s head.  Her 
hands played with the pink ribbon on the front of her nightgown.  &#147;Then 
I won&#146;t tell you any of what I know either.  I won&#146;t say anything about 
how Mako-chan got all quiet after she heard you, or how strange it was 
that she didn&#146;t want to see Ami anymore.  Because Mako-chan always 
wants to see Ami.&#148;  Minako tilted her head back so her smiling face was 
upside down on Rei&#146;s viewscreen.  &#147;She cares about her, you know.  
*Really cares*.&#148;
	At this point, Rei was too tired to be anything other than amused.  
&#147;What makes you say that?&#148;
	&#147;Well,&#148; answered Minako as she turned back onto her stomach, &#147;I 
wasn&#146;t sure at first.  But then there was all that stuff with Haruka, 
and I started to wonder about the way she was always hanging around Ami.  
But she always went boy watching with us.&#148;  Minako frowned in a way 
that Rei found absolutely adorable.  &#147;Then she went and got pregnant 
and that pretty much killed my whole Ami theory.  Until recently anyway.  
See, Mako-chan can barely handle a few hours of us fussing over her, 
but Ami does it more than any of us, and she let her move in.&#148;
	Rei laughed.  &#147;Ami doesn&#146;t live here, Mina.  If she did, I would 
be asleep in my own bed right now.&#148;
	&#147;Look around you, Rei,&#148; said Minako.  &#147;Those are Ami&#146;s books on 
the shelf over by the TV.  Ami&#146;s slippers over there by the door.  Her 
toothbrush is hanging in the bathroom, her clothes are hanging in the 
closet, and she even has her own underwear drawer.  Now if that doesn&#146;t 
say &#145;I live here&#146; I don&#146;t know what does.&#148;
	&#147;How do you know about that?&#148; questioned Rei.
	Minako grinned innocently.  &#147;I was looking for a light bulb.  
Anyway, what are we going to do about it?&#148;
	Rei shook her head.  &#147;*We* aren&#146;t going to do anything.  Mako-
chan said she&#146;s going to handle it.  We&#146;re going to give her a little 
time to get things straight in her own head.  But if she doesn&#146;t by the 
end of the week, a little gentle persuasion from her friends might be 
in order.&#148;
	&#147;We could always lock them in a closet together,&#148; suggested 
Minako with a giggle.
	&#147;Yeah,&#148; smiled Rei.  She sighed.  &#147;You know, I think the five of 
us have had a serious breakdown in communication lately.  We all need 
to get together and have an all-out, no holds barred gossip fest.&#148;
	Over the music of Minako&#146;s laughter, Rei heard another sound.  
The metallic clink of a key sliding into a lock gave way to the front 
door opening slowly.
	&#147;I&#146;ve got company, Mina,&#148; said Rei quickly and quietly.  &#147;Gotta 
go.  Love you.&#148;  She deactivated her communicator and shoved it under 
her pillow just as Ami noticed her on the floor.
	&#147;Rei, why are you on the floor?&#148; asked Ami quietly as she moved 
into the living room.
	&#147;It&#146;s more comfortable than the couch,&#148; answered Rei.  &#147;Why are 
you here so early?  It&#146;s barely five o&#146;clock.&#148;
	Ami shrugged as she sat in the chair across from Rei.  &#147;I just 
couldn&#146;t sleep.&#148;
	Rei smirked.  &#147;Join the club.&#148;
	Ami nodded absently, then moved over onto the couch.  As Rei 
continued talking, she reached down between the couch and end table and 
pulled out the pillow she always slept with.  &#147;Mom was still asleep 
when I left,&#148; answered Ami as she laid down and tucked the pillow under 
her head.  &#147;I didn&#146;t see a point in waking her up.&#148;
	&#147;You snuck out?&#148;
	&#147;No, I left early for school,&#148; replied Ami.  She yawned and 
closed her eyes as her head snuggled down into the pillow.  &#147;I always 
leave early for school.&#148;
	Rei raised an eyebrow in disbelief.  She would have commented on 
Ami&#146;s &#145;leaving early for school&#146;, but it was pointless.  Ami wouldn&#146;t 
have heard her.  Rei glared at the form curled up and sleeping 
peacefully on the couch.  ~I swear the two of you are going to be the 
death of me.~
