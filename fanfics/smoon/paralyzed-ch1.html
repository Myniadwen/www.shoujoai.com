<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/atara.html">Atara</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;Mako-chan, it&#39;ll be fun, I promise!&quot; A short blond hared girl tugged on 
the arm of a taller girl, her sky blue eyes as pitiful as she could 
manage.

&quot;Minako-chan, I can&#39;t dance, why would a dance club be fun?&quot; Makoto 
looked down at the other girl, arching an eyebrow over one emerald 
colored eye. &quot;Oh no, don&#39;t you start with those puppy-dog eyes.&quot;

&quot;It would be fun because the others would be there, I even talked 
Haruka-san and Michiru-san into stopping by for a while. Even Ami-chan 
was somewhat excited about this place opening up last week. Come on 
Mako-chan, pleaseeeeee? We can stay out all night, we don&#39;t have school 
tomorrow...&quot; Minako turned her puppy-dog eyes up to full volume, then 
abruptly switched tactics. Reaching up with a slender hand, she brushed 
a piece of Makoto&#39;s auburn hair behind her ear. &quot;Remember that new 
outfit you bought when we went shopping last week? You looked stunning, 
it would be perfect...&quot;

Makoto suddenly found herself having a somewhat difficult time 
swallowing. &quot;Ah...yeah...I remember the outfit you mean...who would I 
look stunning to?&quot;

Minako slowly grinned and took a step back from the other girl. &quot;Oh, 
probably everyone in the room...&quot; She then turned around and continued 
towards the park where they were going to meet their friends. &quot;Trust me, 
it&#39;ll be fun. Come on, we&#39;re already late.&quot;

&quot;No thanks to you. I told you not to touch that pan...&quot; Makoto grinned 
and playfully punched Minako on the shoulder. &quot;If we didn&#39;t have to 
clean that mess we&#39;d be there by now.&quot;

&quot;Yeah yeah yeah...&quot; Minako blushed and then smirked. &quot;So, are you going 
to come or not?&quot;

Makoto rolled her eyes skyward. &quot;Ok fine, I&#39;ll come with, if it&#39;ll get 
you off my back.&quot;

&quot;Great! Don&#39;t forget to wear that outfit I mentioned, ok?&quot; Minako 
grinned and made a little hop-skip.

&quot;And if I don&#39;t?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll...&quot; Minako blinked, at a loss for a comeback to that one.

Makoto laughed and shook her head. &quot;I&#39;ll wear it. Don&#39;t worry. What time 
are we doing this?&quot;

Minako shrugged. &quot;Not sure yet. I was going to bring that up with 
everyone else.&quot; They had entered the park by this time, instinct leading 
them towards where they knew they would find their other friends. Sure 
enough, three young women were seated underneath a cherry tree, just 
where Minako and Makoto expected to find them. One of them was barely 
visible behind a large textbook, the only real visible part of her being 
her blue hair and eyes as she read, ignoring the other two who were 
arguing over something or another. One of the participants in the 
argument was another blond, this one having a rather unusual hairstyle 
of two ponytails streaming down from two buns on either side of her 
head. The other arguer was a young woman with long raven colored hair, 
her violet eyes sparking as she debated with the blue-eyed blond. As 
Makoto and Minako neared the group, the subject of the argument became 
somewhat clearer.

&quot;And why can&#39;t Mamo-chan come? Just because you don&#39;t have a 
boyfriend...&quot; The blond protested, cut off by the other.

&quot;That&#39;s exactly why he can&#39;t come! This is a night out for us girls 
Usagi-chan. Its not like you don&#39;t see him every day for goodness sakes! 
I saw you two when I got here. He practically had to peel you off his 
arm to leave!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re just jealous Rei-chan!&quot; Usagi stuck her tongue out at her 
violet-eyed friend.

&quot;I am not!&quot; Rei responded in kind, and the two settled into their usual 
routine.

Makoto and Minako sat down on the other side of the blanket, immediately 
ignoring the two arguing girls. &quot;So Ami-chan, anything interesting in 
there?&quot; Minako asked the book.

&quot;Oh yes! There is an amazing section about copepods and their habits, it 
really is quite engaging...&quot; Ami suddenly looked up, realizing who had 
asked her that question, met Minako&#39;s amused look and blushed. &quot;Oh, 
hello Minako-chan, Mako-chan.&quot;

&quot;Hiya...so, how long have they been going at it?&quot; Makoto gestured 
towards the two who were beginning to turn blue in the face.

&quot;Frankly, I haven&#39;t noticed...&quot;

Minako chuckled and fished around in her backpack. &quot;Not surprising.&quot; She 
found what she was looking for and dropped it between Usagi and Rei, 
laughing as they both suddenly turned their attention towards said 
object.

&quot;Oh my god Minako-chan! Where did you get this?&quot; Rei picked up the 
magazine, her eyes fastened on the picture it was opened to.

&quot;From England. Katrina sent it to me...she thought I might like it.&quot; 
Minako smiled softly.

&quot;Wow...he is so cute...&quot; Usagi sighed slightly and she and Rei were soon 
fully engrossed in looking at the pictures in the magazine.

&quot;You know, you two are looking at that backwards...books and magazines 
are printed in reverse there...&quot; Ami pointed at her book and then to the 
magazine, trailing off when she noticed the lack of response. &quot;Oh I give 
up.&quot;

Makoto laughed and patted Ami on the shoulder. &quot;Its ok, they can&#39;t read 
it anyway.&quot;

A small conversation started about the strangeness of the reverse print 
of English books and about the movie stars pictured in the magazine 
before Minako&#39;s mind switched back to the event happening later that 
night.

&quot;Ok, so when and where are we going to meet?&quot; She asked as she managed 
to snag her magazine back from Usagi.

&quot;We could meet at my place like we usually do.&quot; Rei suggested as she 
took a cookie offered by Makoto.

&quot;Your place isn&#39;t too close to the club though Rei-chan. I don&#39;t want to 
ride a bus there.&quot; Usagi made a face as she took two cookies.

&quot;How about at your place then Ami? You don&#39;t live too far from it do 
you?&quot; Rei suggested.

Ami blinked and put her book down. &quot;My place...yes, it is closer. I 
suppose we could meet there. Not something we usually do however.&quot;

&quot;And going to an American style dance club is something we do on a 
regular basis?&quot; Makoto laughed. &quot;Ok, Ami&#39;s place. What time?&quot;

&quot;Six?&quot; Rei suggested again, looking for an excuse to get out of some of 
her chores.

Minako shook her head no. &quot;The place doesn&#39;t open until nine Rei-chan. I 
don&#39;t want to be there exactly when it opens up. Nothing happens until 
at least an hour after it opens.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a good thing we don&#39;t have classes tomorrow...&quot; Ami mused. &quot;Why 
don&#39;t we meet at my place around 9, that will give Usagi enough leeway 
to get there on time.&quot;

&quot;Works for me.&quot; Makoto agreed, and the others nodded assent.

&quot;Excellent! I know we&#39;ll have a great time tonight guys. Trust me on 
this.&quot; Minako beamed and looked at Makoto out of the corner of her eye. 
Makoto blinked once, and blushed slightly, looking a little confused. 
Minako laughed lightly and stood up. &quot;I have to go though, I&#39;m expecting 
a phone call, and I have a quick errand to run. See you all later!&quot; She 
waved and jogged off, her long hair swaying behind her. Makoto found 
herself staring after her, startled out of her thoughts when Usagi 
shrieked.

&quot;Augh! A spider! Get it off!&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Makoto walked back to her apartment slowly, her thoughts jumbled. She 
and the others had left the park shortly after Minako had, after 
vanquishing the evil spider that had foolishly attacked their 
princess...Makoto chuckled to herself and rolled her eyes at the memory. 
Another memory popped into its place, this one of another blond hared 
young woman and the events of the afternoon. Makoto frowned. She 
couldn&#39;t quite understand exactly what had happened, but she knew it was 
pulling up old thoughts again. Walking into her apartment building she 
sighed, and headed for the elevators. After a gut-wrenching ride in the 
old elevator, she made her way down the hall and into her apartment, 
throwing her jacket over a chair and then falling over onto her couch.

She had long ago realized that she had feelings for the senshi of love, 
but she had never even remotely thought that those feelings might be 
returned. Why would they? She had reasoned. Minako was beautiful and 
athletic, had a wonderful sense of humor and was constantly on the go, 
ready for anything. In her opinion, she did truly consider Minako the 
goddess of Venus. And like all gods and goddesses...out of her reach. 
But the events of the afternoon had sparked a small flame of a thought 
that wouldn&#39;t behave itself at all. She knew that Minako was a flirt, 
but she had never directed it towards any of her friends before, not 
even in jest. Sighing, she sat up from the couch and looked towards a 
clock.

&quot;Only four...plenty of time to get ready...&quot; Makoto fidgeted about a 
bit. &quot;Well...it wouldn&#39;t hurt to start getting ready now...&quot; With that 
decided, she stood from the couch and headed for the shower.

Nine o&#39;clock eventually came around, and Makoto found herself looking up 
at Ami&#39;s apartment building. She glanced down at herself and gave 
herself a final once over. She was wearing a spaghetti strap green 
sequined top which clung to her like a second skin, she idly thought 
that she didn&#39;t need the straps to hold the thing up. She had on a pair 
of tight black leather pants, and she smirked, admiring herself. A pair 
of black boots came halfway up her calves, when she choose them Minako 
had commented on how similar they were to the boots she wore as a 
senshi, and she decided that Minako was right. Two thick silver 
bracelets shifted on her right arm as she moved her hand up to run a 
finger over the fine silver chain she wore around her neck, and the 
small lightning bolt charm which hung from it. She had elected to keep 
her hair up in its usual ponytail, but substituted a leather tie to hold 
it up instead of the tie she usually wore. Satisfied, she entered the 
building and pushed the button for the elevator.

&quot;Mako-chan!&quot; A voice called, and Makoto turned around to see who was 
calling her. Usagi was heading her way, waving an arm in the air as she 
smiled at her friend. Usagi was wearing a loose white blouse with a 
black leather jacket and a short black skirt, which showed off her legs 
quite nicely. She wore a simple pair of black flats, and had her hair 
held up in a bun instead of her usual ponytails. &quot;Wow Mako-chan, you 
look fantastic!&quot; Usagi looked her friend over once she was standing next 
to the tall girl.

&quot;You don&#39;t look to bad yourself. Mamoru-san knows you&#39;re going out with 
us tonight right?&quot; she smirked and Usagi giggled.

&quot;Yeah, he knows. He wanted to come, but I told him that Rei would kill 
him if he did. I think he was jealous!&quot; Usagi giggled again and pulled 
Makoto into the waiting elevator.

&quot;Mamoru-san? Jealous? Heh, why ever for?&quot; Makoto grinned and Usagi 
laughed outright.

&quot;He has nothing to worry about, trust me.&quot; Usagi smiled and fingered the 
promise ring he had given her for her last birthday.

Makoto smiled. &quot;I know, I know.&quot;

With a soft &#145;ding!&#39; the elevator doors slid open and the two headed down 
the hallway to Ami&#39;s apartment, both blinking as the door opened even 
before Makoto could lift her hand to knock. Rei stood there with a 
startled look on her face before she burst out laughing. &quot;I was just 
going to go downstairs and see if you two were here yet.&quot; She held the 
door open for them and then shut it behind them. &quot;Ami! Mako-chan and 
Usagi-chan are here.&quot;

&quot;I told you they would be here soon.&quot; Ami replied as she walked into the 
living room, and smiled. Ever the conservative one, Ami was wearing a 
sleeveless light blue dress that came down to just above her knees, and 
a pair of boots the same color stopping just below her knees. A silver 
necklace with a blue stone hung around her neck, and a simple watch 
wrapped around her slender wrist.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s a first for Usagi to be on time.&quot; Rei smirked and shrugged, 
walking past Ami to sit on the couch, running a hand through her bangs. 
She had drawn her hair back into a long braid, weaving a red ribbon 
through it when she did so. She wore a red short sleeved shirt which 
barred her well toned stomach, and a low cut pair of black jean shorts, 
which some would classify as Daisy Dukes. She also wore a pair of black 
cowboy boots that she had at one time swore she would never have a 
decent outfit to wear with and wasn&#39;t going to buy until Minako 
threatened her with bodily harm if she didn&#39;t buy them.

&quot;Where&#39;s Minako-chan?&quot; Makoto asked, glancing around the apartment.

&quot;She called earlier to say that she would have to meet us there...I 
guess the phone call she was expecting hadn&#39;t come yet, and she didn&#39;t 
want to miss it.&quot; Ami replied. &quot;We&#39;re going to meet Michiru-san and 
Haruka-san there as well.&quot;

Usagi bounced in place. &quot;Lets go! Its 9:30, it will take us a little 
while to get there, and if we don&#39;t have to wait for Minako, we can just 
go.&quot;

The four looked at each other and nodded. &quot;Lets go!&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The club was called &quot;The American Eagle&quot;, a large bird arching over the 
doors to emphasize this. It was an all ages club, the downstairs being 
strictly for dancing and food, the upstairs contained another dance 
club, and a bar, complete with a bouncer to check ages. The inside was 
filled with neon lights and advertising signs from various American 
products such as sodas. The front of the room was filled with tables and 
there were booths all along the walls, the back of the room occupied by 
the dance floor, a d.j. set up in a back corner. The four made their way 
to a larger booth along the edge of the dance floor, the door within 
sight so they could spot their other friends once they came. Rei and 
Usagi immediately dragged Ami out onto the dance floor, leaving Makoto 
to decide if they wanted anything to eat or not. Makoto stood on the 
other side of their claimed booth, her eyes scanning the crowd. About 
ten minutes passed, Ami escaping from the dance floor for a while before 
Usagi pulled her back, then the three returning to the booth and quickly 
setting into happy conversation. Makoto sat down and joined in, and soon 
Usagi and Rei were pulling her out onto the dance floor, despite her 
protests.

The song picked up a Latin beat, the singers voice and the beat filling 
the room. He sang about the paralyzing affects of his lover&#39;s presence, 
of the way simply looking at him could make him freeze in place, and how 
he was powerless to fight it. Makoto considered the lyrics while 
dancing, and decided that it had a pretty good description of what 
happened when that &#145;certain someone&#39; would enter a room.

The song began over, and Makoto looked towards the D.J., wondering if it 
was a mistake. &quot;Hey, the song started over...&quot; She shouted to Rei.

&quot;So? It&#39;s a good song!&quot; Rei grinned to her and then moved towards a guy 
who had caught her attention.

Abruptly, Makoto had realized that Usagi had returned to the table, and 
was about to go there herself when she caught sight of Minako on the 
other side of the dance floor. Either she had come in through the back, 
or had been there for a while, because she was situated by the D.J. 
Makoto backed up until she was against a wall and leaned against it 
heavily for support as she stood there and simply stared. Minako was 
wearing an extremely tight sleeveless gold dress that had a light blue 
design wrapping around her body like a snake. The dress stopped well 
above her knees, and seemed to shine with every movement she made. She 
also wore a pair of gold sandals, which caused Makoto to smirk at the 
similarity to her shoes as a senshi. She had pulled the majority of her 
hair up into a bun, a braid wrapping around it and around her head, a 
few strands hanging loose at the sides. Minako&#39;s eyes quickly scanned 
over the crowd before settling on Makoto and staying there. She smiled, 
and Makoto found herself drawn into Minako&#39;s gaze, and quite suddenly 
discovered that she couldn&#39;t move.

Damn. This song is fucking true... she thought to herself as she 
continued to stare at Minako, and felt her heartbeat begin to speed up 
at the sight of her friend.

Minako slowly worked her way through the crowd, brushing off the 
advances of several guys who Makoto now wanted to kill, and finally made 
her way to standing in front of the tall senshi, who could barely 
breathe at this point. Minako slowly looked Makoto over, starting at her 
feet and working her way up, pausing occasionally before finally making 
eye contact again. She smiled and leaned up close to Makoto&#39;s ear so 
that she wouldn&#39;t have to yell and said, &quot;I told you you&#39;d look 
stunning.&quot;

Makoto stuttered a little, having every intention of saying that Minako 
looked stunning herself, but couldn&#39;t make her tongue and voice work 
right. Minako laughed and caught a hold of her hand, and pulled her out 
onto the dance floor. The song continued its Latin beat and Minako moved 
in perfect time with the music, pressing her body up against Makoto for 
a moment before moving away and drawing the taller girl with her. Even 
though she swore she couldn&#39;t dance, Makoto found herself moving in 
harmony with Minako, and all of the other people seemed to disappear as 
she focused all of her attention on the goddess she was dancing with. 
She felt other people&#39;s eyes on the two of them, but frankly, she didn&#39;t 
care. She didn&#39;t care what others might have thought; she didn&#39;t care 
what went through their heads at all. All she cared about was Minako, 
and that&#39;s all she was going to focus on, come hell or high water, and 
there was no way she was going to let anyone get near Minako. They 
stayed out on the floor for a good half hour, moving in harmony with 
each other. The songs changed to a slower beat and Makoto was just about 
to suggest that the two go somewhere to talk for a while when there was 
a tap at her shoulder. Turning around, she met the amused gaze of 
Haruka.

&quot;Mind if I cut in?&quot; Haruka asked. She was wearing a dark blue men&#39;s 
shirt and a pair of black dress pants, apparently not overly concerned 
with dressing up for this particular club. Makoto was just about to say 
no when there was another light tap at her shoulder. Michiru stood 
there, a smile on her face and her hand out stretched. Always elegant, 
Michiru had chosen to wear a turquoise dress that matched her hair 
perfectly, and hung down below her knees. Her hair hung loose around her 
shoulders, and a simple string of pearls wrapped around her neck.

&quot;Its only fair if Haruka steals your dance partner, that you steal 
hers.&quot; Michiru winked and Makoto relaxed, giving Minako a quick glance 
before being led off a slight distance by Michiru.

&quot;When did you two get here?&quot; Makoto asked, letting Michiru do most of 
the leading since she was unused to this particular style of dancing.

&quot;Oh, a little while ago. Saw the two of you dancing together...seems as 
if you have gotten yourself caught in a certain young woman&#39;s love 
chain.&quot; Michiru smiled at Makoto, who blushed.

&quot;I don&#39;t know...I&#39;m not too sure on what all of this means. I know what 
I hope this means, but I haven&#39;t been able to flat out ask her...&quot; 
Makoto glanced back towards where Minako and Haruka were dancing, a 
worried look in her eyes.

&quot;Trust her Makoto. I think our Venus is more like the goddess than any 
of us truly realize. She more than likely has a better grasp of 
understanding love than any of us do.&quot; Michiru leaned in and gave Makoto 
a quick kiss on the cheek. &quot;And trust yourself.&quot;

The song ended and Michiru turned Makoto loose with a slight push on the 
tall girl&#39;s back. Makoto immediately headed back to Minako, who was 
laughing at something Haruka had just said. Haruka nodded to Makoto and 
held out Minako&#39;s hand to Makoto. &quot;Thank you for the dance Minako. I&#39;ll 
talk with you later.&quot; The tall woman nodded again and winked before 
heading back to her partner.

Makoto grasped Minako&#39;s hand, determined to find a place where the two 
of them could talk. Minako seemed to be reading her mind, because she 
began to head towards a booth on the opposite side of the room from the 
rest of their friends. It was a small circular booth with high backs, 
providing a bit of privacy and a slight buffer from the music. The two 
slid towards the center and sat next to each other. &quot;Minako-chan...I...&quot;

&quot;You know what? I changed my mind. Lets get out of here. The others are 
doing fine without us, lets go.&quot; Minako interrupted Makoto and stood 
from the booth, holding out her hand. Makoto smiled and accepted the 
offered hand, and started to lead Minako to the door. Minako caught 
Usagi&#39;s eye and waved, and with a knowing smile, Usagi waved back.

Makoto abruptly stopped outside the club, suddenly unsure as to where to 
go. Minako bumped into Makoto&#39;s back and laughed.

&quot;Don&#39;t stop so suddenly like that...so, where to?&quot; Minako looped her arm 
through Makoto&#39;s and looked around where they were.

Makoto found that being so close to Minako was beginning to affect her 
breathing again, and she glanced at the street sign. &quot;My place. It&#39;s not 
far from here...unless you want to go home?&quot;

Minako snorted. &quot;Are you kidding? Your place is perfect. I sort of told 
Mom I was staying there tonight anyway...&quot; Minako trailed off, looking 
towards the ground and blushing.

Makoto laughed again and lead Minako down the street. &quot;Did you know that 
in my spare closet I have at least one complete outfit from each of you 
guys? You all seem to manage to leave something behind every time you 
stay over.&quot;

&quot;A complete outfit? Totally and absolutely complete?&quot; Minako smirked and 
waggled her eyebrows, making Makoto blush slightly and then laugh.

&quot;Ok, not TOTALLY complete.&quot; She grinned.

&quot;We&#39;ll see what we can do about that.&quot; Minako grinned devilishly and 
broke away from Makoto, walking a step in front of the taller girl, who 
for her part was quite stunned.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The two girls made it to Makoto&#39;s apartment without further 
embarrassment of each other, and Minako settled on the couch while 
Makoto busied herself with making tea.

&quot;You still have any of that Earl Gray tea I sent you last time I went 
back to England?&quot; Minako asked as she gazed around the apartment.

&quot;Yep. Would you like a cup? I have to admit that I didn&#39;t really drink 
much...&quot; Makoto peeked out from the kitchen.

Minako laughed. &quot;That&#39;s ok, I&#39;ll drink it. I developed a liking for the 
stuff.&quot;

Makoto came out of the kitchen with a tray, carefully setting it down on 
the coffee table. &quot;Its...heh, well, its not my cup of tea.&quot; She smirked 
and Minako laughed, sending chills up Makoto&#39;s spine. Makoto resolved to 
try to make Minako laugh more often. She handed Minako the cup of Earl 
Grey and settled back on the couch with her Green Tea. Silence settled 
between the two young women, but it was a comfortable silence. Abruptly, 
Minako yawned and blinked, blushing a soft shade of red.

&quot;Tired?&quot; Makoto grinned.

&quot;Sort of. But not enough to actually want to sleep.&quot; Minako smiled and 
put her cup down, stretching her arms up behind her head, setting her 
anatomy moving pleasantly. She grinned and raised an eyebrow. &quot;Like 
something you see?&quot;

Shit, she caught me staring! Makoto blinked and blushed deeply. &quot;Uh...&quot;

Minako smiled softly and tucked her legs up underneath her, looking down 
at her lap. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Mako-chan...you must think I&#39;m going crazy or 
something...&quot; She spoke so softly that Makoto wasn&#39;t sure she heard her. 
&quot;I...I&#39;ve wanted to say this for a while now...and I understand 
completely if you hate me forever or something...well, no, I don&#39;t 
understand, because its ok and everything but people don&#39;t always 
understand and it sort of annoys me...&quot;

&quot;Minako-chan...&quot;

&quot;And then they&#39;re all stupid and stuff and that&#39;s just wrong...I mean 
love is love and it doesn&#39;t matter right? But for so many people it 
does, and it shouldn&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;Minako-chan...&quot;

Minako blinked, coming out of her little rant. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean 
to go off like that, and you probably had no idea what I was talking 
about...I just...&quot; She looked down at her hands again and Makoto smiled.

&quot;You&#39;re cute when you&#39;re flustered.&quot; Makoto reached out and took a hold 
of one of Minako&#39;s hands, rubbing her thumb back and forth against her 
wrist, smiling as she could feel Minako&#39;s pulse speed up.

Minako looked at Makoto&#39;s hand and smiled again, a little wider this 
time. &quot;Mako-chan...&quot;

A breathless pause. Please say what I want you to say... Makoto thought, 
and she could swear that her heart stopped.

&quot;I love you.&quot; Minako whispered, still looking down. She blinked in 
surprise as she felt Makoto&#39;s hand on her chin, guiding her face upwards 
to meet her lips in a gentle kiss. When they finally broke apart, Makoto 
rested her forehead against Minako&#39;s and smiled.

&quot;I was hoping you&#39;d say that. I&#39;ve loved you for a long time Minako...I 
could never find the right way to say it to you...&quot; She kissed the 
blonde&#39;s forehead and pulled her into a close hug, and Minako rested her 
head on Makoto&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I love you too...so much...&quot; She blinked as 
she felt wetness on her shoulder, and pulled back slightly. &quot;Minako? Why 
are you crying?&quot;

Minako sat back slightly and wiped at her eyes. &quot;Its ok, 
really...I&#39;ve...I&#39;ve been so lonely for so long Mako-chan. No 
relationship I&#39;ve ever been in has worked...we can do this right?&quot;

Makoto responded with another soft kiss. &quot;Of course we can.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not going to be easy. People out there don&#39;t always understand...&quot;

&quot;Hey, we&#39;re sailor senshi. We always come out on top.&quot;

Minako grinned, a glint in her eyes, one that Makoto would come to know 
quite well. &quot;On top eh?&quot;

Makoto arched her eyebrows in surprise and laughed. &quot;Well, I suppose...&quot;

Minako reached behind her and let her hair loose from its bun, letting 
her long blond hair cascade behind her. Makoto couldn&#39;t resist and 
reached out to run her hand through it, smiling happily. Minako stood 
from the couch and pulled Makoto up with her, then reached over to 
Makoto&#39;s cd player to see what was inside. Finding it to her liking, she 
pressed play and a soft song came from the speakers. Pulling Makoto 
close, the two began to dance the night away.

And Makoto wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Author&#39;s note

Whee! Man, I wrote this a long time ago, but I still like it. Considered 
writing further on it, but Im not entirely certain. Minako/Makoto is one 
of my favorite pairings, though when I drag the Outer Senshi into it, 
things generally shift to Minako/Hotaru, and I&#39;ll possibly post one of 
those stories soon as well. Depending on reaction, I may or may not make 
this a continued story, but for now, here&#39;s a preliminary chapter, or a 
nice little one shot, we&#39;ll see. :)</pre>
