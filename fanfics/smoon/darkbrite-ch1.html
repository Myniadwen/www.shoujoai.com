<h1>Dark Skies, Bright Heavens (part 1 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/immora.html">Immora</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The Kaze and Ten&#39;ou families had been close friends longer than they 
could trace. Before Utano Kotori and Kaze Fushigi married, they had 
attended school with Ten&#39;ou Tsuyoi and Yorokobino Kobun, who also got 
married. Kotori and Kobun were firmly set on the idea of their families 
staying closely tied, and agreed that if they had children, they would 
marry them off to each other. Fushigi and Tsuyoi were a bit reluctant to 
agree with their wives at first, but eventually gave in.

Fushigi had brown hair and green eyes, Kotori having wavy blond hair and 
blue eyes, passing on to their daughter, Sunao, brown hair and teal 
eyes. Tsuyoi had black hair and eyes, while Kobun had dark blond hair 
and purple eyes, and their son, Katai, received dark blond hair and 
black eyes. They also had a daughter a couple years later named Teinei, 
with strawberry blond hair and purple eyes.

Katai and Sunao had their marriage arranged for them long before they 
were old enough to be married. Their parents decided to hold off on 
telling them to see if they would fall in love on their own. Sunao and 
Teinei were very close friends, spending a lot of time together, so 
Sunao was often put in the position of being around Katai. Eventually, 
Katai and Sunao started dating, despite Teinei&#39;s insistence that her 
brother was a wacko. They found that they didn&#39;t really get along as 
well as they had hoped they would, but their parents insisted that the 
marriage had to go through.

Katai and Sunao married, and after being married, fell in love. Sunao 
became pregnant with twins, expecting them towards the end of January.

The Kaiou and Inochino families were also tied together after being 
friends for a long time. Kaiou Tensai was good friends with Inochino 
Miyage, both boys coming from rich, uptight families. They were both 
told to marry young, and neither really liked the idea. Two of their 
friends, Neko Ureshii and Hoshiou Rippa, had been told to do similar 
things, and before they finished college, Tensai and Ureshii were 
engaged, and Miyage and Rippa as well.

Tensai had wavy brown hair and eyes, and Ureshii had long green hair and 
eyes. Their son, Tadashii, had wavy green hair and brown eyes. Miyage 
had blond hair and green eyes, and Rippa had wavy deep blue hair and 
eyes. Their daughter, Ki, had wavy blue hair and deep blue eyes. 
Tadashii and Ki fell in love when they were young and married when they 
finished school. Their first child was a son, Kanzen, had green hair and 
deep blue eyes. Two years later, they had a daughter, Suteki, with blue 
green hair and green eyes, two years later, another daughter, Kirei, 
with brown hair and blue eyes. Ki became pregnant yet again, two years 
later, expecting triplets in March, the same year that the Ten&#39;ous 
expected their twins.

Neither family could have predicted how close some of their newest 
arrivals would become.



**********



Sunao lay in the hospital bed with Katai at her side, waiting to find 
out the results from her doctor. The doctor came in with a bright smile 
on her face. &quot;Congratulations!&quot; she told them. &quot;The tests show that you 
will be having _two_ children, twins, a boy and a girl.&quot;

Sunao and Katai cheered and hugged each other happily, before Sunao let 
out a tiny &quot;ow&quot; as Katai pushed against her belly accidentally. &quot;Whoops, 
I&#39;m sorry about that, Sunao,&quot; he quickly apologized. He grinned and 
kissed her belly. &quot;Two bundles of joy on the way! We&#39;re truly lucky!&quot;

Sunao smiled and patted her extended waistline. &quot;And it&#39;ll be both a boy 
and a girl; you&#39;ll get the son you&#39;ve wanted and I&#39;ll have my daughter.&quot;

Katai smiled back broadly. &quot;Oh, thank you very much, doctor.&quot;

The doctor nodded and gave them the folder of information, then the 
couple left the office.



**********



They spent the next few months preparing their home for the arrivals. A 
room was prepared with boys&#39; and girls&#39; decor in it, two cribs, stuffed 
animals, and various other toys and things to occupy their children when 
they arrived. Katai was eagerly awaiting the day of their birth, to have 
the son he&#39;d wanted for so long. He wanted to raise his son to be 
someone special, someone his father would be proud of. It was Katai&#39;s 
dream and he was anxious for it to come true. He put in some extra hours 
at the office to earn more money, saving it up to spend on his son when 
he arrived. He&#39;d cut back on a lot of things he enjoyed, including all 
the different sports and car magazines he read, some things he 
collected, and drinking, which he said he &quot;only find mildly amusing, 
anyways.&quot;

Sunao was just as excited at the idea of having a daughter to raise. 
Katai had already agreed with her that he should be the one to focus on 
raising their son, and her their daughter. Sunao had wanted children for 
a long time, not caring whether it was a girl or boy, but she was very 
happy to be having both. While Katai was at work, she sewed, went to the 
store, and was visited by her parents, Katai&#39;s parents, and Teinei.

At the store one day, she was looking for cereals when she bumped into 
someone next to her. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she quickly apologized. &quot;I&#39;m a bit 
clumsy right now.&quot;

A woman&#39;s laughter soon followed. &quot;That&#39;s all right, I&#39;m in the same 
condition myself.&quot;

Sunao smiled as the blue haired woman patted her own belly. &quot;When is 
yours due?&quot; she asked the woman.

&quot;Early March. I&#39;m expecting triplets! Two girls and a boy, according to 
the doctor. We&#39;re not sure yet if the girls are identical. You?&quot;

Sunao smiled. &quot;Late January, a girl and a boy.&quot;

&quot;Both of us having multiple births,&quot; the woman smiled widely. &quot;I know 
it&#39;s very exciting for me. I have two daughters already who are two and 
four, and a son, six years old. You?&quot;

&quot;These are my first,&quot; Sunao replied. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, what was your name?&quot;

&quot;Kaiou Ki, you?&quot;

&quot;Ten&#39;ou Sunao.&quot; They bowed to each other, then Sunao looked at her 
quizzically. &quot;Your name sounds familiar... you&#39;re married to Kaiou 
Tadashii?&quot;

&quot;Why yes, I am. My father, Inochino Miyage, is a violinist.&quot;

&quot;Ah yes, I&#39;ve heard his music before; he&#39;s quite good. Do you play as 
well?&quot;

Ki chuckled slightly. &quot;Not nearly as well. He&#39;s going to teach little 
Michiru when she&#39;s a bit older.&quot; She patted her belly again. &quot;I&#39;m going 
to make sure she&#39;s a fine lady when she&#39;s older. Tadashii&#39;s mother, 
Ureshii, wants to teach her about art since my other children don&#39;t seem 
to be too interested in that. Kanzen has already shown that he&#39;s more 
interested in studying, Suteki&#39;s more into dolls, and Kirei, well, we 
aren&#39;t sure about her yet... she&#39;s just enjoying playing games, right 
now. I think Genki will be smart like his brother, and Tadashii would 
love for him to take up sports. I&#39;d like to make sure Kanpeki does art 
too, maybe writing. What do you want your children to do?&quot;

Sunao shrugged slightly. &quot;Katai and I just want them to be happy. Katai 
and I have agreed that I will raise our daughter and he&#39;ll take care of 
our son. Not that we won&#39;t be involved with both kids, but we want to 
focus on them separately.&quot;

&quot;No names yet?&quot;

Sunao smiled a bit and replied, &quot;We are trying to decide still. Katai is 
considering Akarui for our son, I think it would be nice too. We aren&#39;t 
sure about our daughter yet.&quot;

&quot;Hmmm... well, good luck with them,&quot; Ki said.

&quot;You too,&quot; Sunao said as they walked off in separate directions.



**********



When Ki got home, her kids all rushed to her. &quot;Mama Mama Mama Mama!&quot; 
Kirei shouted. &quot;Guess what?!&quot;

&quot;What is it, Kirei-chan?&quot;

&quot;Our babysitter left already-- Papa&#39;s home early!&quot;

Ki smiled as Tadashii came over. &quot;You find everything all right at the 
store?&quot;

&quot;Yes, and they&#39;ve been kicking quite a lot,&quot; Ki said, patting her belly. 
&quot;Whoops, there they go again!&quot; 



Tadashii placed his head against her with a smile. &quot;Full of energy, 
aren&#39;t they?&quot;

&quot;Oof, they sure are!&quot;

The other children came over and felt her belly too. &quot;Oooo, feels 
weird,&quot; Suteki said.

&quot;It&#39;s very weird,&quot; Kanzen agreed.

&quot;C&#39;mon, kids,&quot; Tadashii said. &quot;Let&#39;s go unload the groceries and let 
mama rest.&quot;

They went out to the car to get the bags and Ki practically flopped onto 
the couch. &quot;I can&#39;t wait till these babies arrives!&quot; she sighed.



**********



Sunao wiped her hand across her sweaty forehead, a broad smile on both 
her and Katai&#39;s faces. The doctor and nurses were also smiling as they 
handed the two wrapped bundles to the proud new parents. &quot;Congratula- 
tions,&quot; they told Sunao and Katai as the two carefully cradled the 
babies. &quot;If you need anything, we&#39;ll be out in the hall.&quot; Just as he was 
about to shut the door, he added, &quot;I&#39;d be very careful with the boy 
though, he seems to be a bit delicate. We&#39;ll want him to stay here at 
the hospital a few days longer than his sister to make sure everything&#39;s 
all right.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;ll be fine, doctor, and thank you,&quot; Sunao said weakly.

Sunao and Katai looked down into the faces of their new children. The 
girl had dark blond hair, and her eyes, already opened wide, were a dark 
teal. The boy had brown hair and his eyes, sleepily opening and 
shutting, were black. Sunao and Katai&#39;s parents, along with Teinei, 
crowded around and admired the two newborns.

&quot;Oh, they are so cute,&quot; Teinei cooed.

&quot;She&#39;s got your eyes, Sunao,&quot; Kotori remarked happily.

&quot;He looks just like you, except his hair&#39;s darker,&quot; Tsuyoi told his son.

&quot;What are you naming them?&quot; Kobun asked her son.

&quot;Well,&quot; Katai started, &quot;we decided on Akarui for the boy and--&quot;

Akarui started coughing and Katai frowned, adjusting his hold on the 
baby. &quot;Otou-san, get the doctor please.&quot;

Tsuyoi went outside immediately to get the doctor while Akarui continued 
coughing. The doctor came back in with the nurses and was followed by 
someone with a rolling cart. &quot;We better get him checked right now,&quot; he 
said.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Fushigi asked.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure yet; we won&#39;t know until we check things out. I&#39;ll keep 
you informed.&quot;

&quot;Doctor, he&#39;s not breathing,&quot; one of the nurses said.

&quot;Let&#39;s get down there, quick!&quot;

The doctor and nurses rushed out of the room with the baby on the 
medical cart. Sunao watched with wide eyes and clutched her daughter 
tighter to her fearfully. Katai looked equally terrified and sat down by 
her side. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s because the labor was so long,&quot; Kobun said, trying 
to reassure them. &quot;Many babies have breathing problems when they are 
first born, but make it through just fine.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, don&#39;t worry, onii-san,&quot; Teinei told her brother. &quot;They&#39;ll check 
him out and it&#39;ll be all right.&quot;

Sunao carefully shifted the girl in her arms, trying not to panic. What 
was happening with her son? It had been several minutes already.

&quot;What&#39;s the girl&#39;s name?&quot; Kotori asked, trying to keep their minds off 
of it.

&quot;We were thinking--&quot; Sunao started, when a nurse came in.

&quot;Excuse me, Ten&#39;ou-san? Please come with me.&quot;

Katai paled and followed her immediately. The hospital room fell very 
quiet when Katai left and stayed that way the next several minutes.

When Katai walked in, he was nearly white in the face, his eyes shimmer- 
ing with unshed tears. The nurse and the doctor followed him.

&quot;Katai?&quot; Sunao whispered. &quot;What&#39;s wrong? Katai?&quot;

The doctor cleared his throat, lowering his head, and said, &quot;I&#39;m afraid 
that... your son didn&#39;t make it.&quot;

Gasps came from around the room, and Teinei quickly took the baby girl 
as Sunao sat up, trying to get to Katai. &quot;No, this can&#39;t be!&quot; she cried, 
tears quickly pouring down her face. &quot;Are you sure?! Are you sure he... 
he...&quot;

The doctor handed his folder to Fushigi as he spoke, &quot;He had stopped 
breathing and never started again. His heart stopped a few minutes 
later. We tried everything we could, but in his condition... His lungs 
were too weak to sustain him. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; 

&quot;Please leave us,&quot; Kobun quietly whispered, and both the doctor and the 
nurse nodded and left.

Katai hugged Sunao tightly, both crying against each other. Teinei sadly 
continued to cradle the baby girl in her arms, looking down at her, also 
crying softly. Kobun and Tsuyoi went to try and console their son, 
Kotori and Fushigi also moving to hug their daughter. While Sunao 
gratefully accepted her parents&#39; embrace, Katai shoved his back and fled 
from the room. Teinei came forward slowly, and handed the girl to Sunao, 
who tenderly took the baby in her arms. &quot;I can&#39;t believe this happened,&quot; 
she murmured as she looked down at her daughter. &quot;It all happened so 
quickly ...&quot; She trembled and lowered her head. &quot;My poor Haruka won&#39;t 
have a brother now... Katai won&#39;t have the son he&#39;s wanted...&quot;

Fushigi and Kotori stayed with her as the Ten&#39;ous quietly left the room 
to find Katai.



Sunao lay sleeping in her hospital bed, Katai still wide-awake in a 
chair next to her. Haruka had been taken away by the doctors to be 
checked up and they would see her again tomorrow.

The hospital had a special wing where they kept newborns that still 
needed medical attention. All the babies were in small cribs with 
heating systems. That night, there were only a few other babies in there 
besides the Ten&#39;ous&#39; child, and all the doctors and nurses were 
currently on another floor discussing their tiny patients. The room 
where the babies were was dark and the faint sound of tiny bodies 
breathing could be heard. It was set far apart from any other rooms in 
the hospital, its hallways long, leading to stairways going up to higher 
floors, thus it was kept quiet so the babies could rest.

The door creaked slightly as a tall woman slowly walked into the room 
and made her way over to the crib where Ten&#39;ou Haruka was kept. She 
carefully lifted the baby, who stirred and reached to grab a strand of 
her long, dark green hair. The baby cooed a bit at first, and whimpered 
when the woman carefully pried her hair from the baby&#39;s pale hands with 
her own tanned ones. Her dark red eyes softened as she smiled down at 
Haruka and gently soothed her as she started to cry.

&quot;Ssshhh... hush, little one. The time for crying will come later,&quot; she 
murmured.

The baby stopped crying after several moments, then looked up at the 
lithe woman.

&quot;I know you can&#39;t understand what I say to you yet, but one day you&#39;ll 
be able to, and then you will remember this meeting. You have an 
important future ahead of you, a very important mission to complete. But 
before that can happen, you will know a lot of pain and sadness, but 
then you&#39;ll know a joy much greater than many others can ever 
experience.&quot; She smiled sadly and sighed. &quot;Oh, Haruka-chan, I&#39;ve missed 
you and the others. It isn&#39;t easy to guard alone. You are the first one 
to return, and Michiru-chan will be next. I wish there was a way I could 
speak to you when you were older and could understand and remember this, 
but I&#39;m not permitted. But you will be able to remember this when the 
time comes, so that there will be less confusion when I join you in your 
mission.&quot; She carefully set Haruka back in the crib and smiled down at 
her. &quot;I know you&#39;re the one, I know it. Let&#39;s see that symbol, shall we, 
to make sure?&quot;

The woman held her hand out, and the symbol of Pluto glowed purple on 
her forehead. The baby looked up and the symbol of Uranus glowed indigo 
on her forehead. The woman smiled widely and said proudly, &quot;Yes, you 
will be a fine Senshi when the time comes. Farewell, my friend.&quot;

Just as she turned to leave, a nurse came in and turned on a light. &quot;Um, 
excuse me, miss? What are you doing in here?&quot;

The woman hid her smile and replied, &quot;Just visiting little Ten&#39;ou 
Haruka. I&#39;m a friend of the family; Meiou Setsuna.&quot;

&quot;Oh, well... in the future, make sure you check with a doctor before 
coming in.&quot;

&quot;I will, thank you.&quot;

Setsuna pulled the handle of the door shut. The nurse remembered the 
instant it shut that the family of the baby had specifically said no one
besides their family members, the Kazes and the Ten&#39;ous, would be 
visiting. She quickly rushed to the door to find Meiou Setsuna and to 
call security in case she had somehow tampered with the child. &quot;Hey, 
miss! You&#39;re going to have to--&quot;

She stopped in shock as she looked both ways down the hall. No one was 
there. &quot;Impossible!&quot; she whispered in astonishment. Even if someone ran 
at their top speed down these halls, they wouldn&#39;t be to the stairways 
in the time that spanned between Setsuna leaving and the nurse opening 
the door. The nurse blinked rapidly and listened carefully, but couldn&#39;t 
hear any sounds, such as the sounds of someone walking or running, 
breathing, talking. &quot;What could have happened to her?&quot; the nurse 
wondered as she went back into the room, reaching for a folder to file a 
report.



**********



&quot;Okay, kids, it&#39;s all right to come in now,&quot; Tadashii told his three 
older children, a proud smile on his face. He led them into the hospital 
room where Ki was, her parents and Tadashii&#39;s also there. Ki held the 
tiny babies in her arms, looking weary but very happy. 

&quot;Wow,&quot; Kirei said. &quot;Babies...&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re much cuter than Kirei and Suteki,&quot; Kanzen commented. Suteki 
stuck her tongue out at him as soon as he said that.

They looked down at their new siblings in awe. The first born was Genki. 
He was unremarkable in their eyes; blond hair and brown eyes, a bit 
smallish, and was very hungry. The next born was Michiru. She had hair 
that was a shade of aquamarine paler than that of Suteki&#39;s, and her 
sleepily opening eyes were a rich blue. The last born was Kanpeki, and 
it turned out that she wasn&#39;t Michiru&#39;s twin. She had blond hair and 
deep blue eyes, was much tinier than her two triplets, and was wide 
awake, looking around as if checking out the place.

Tensai patted his grinning son on the back while Ureshii kissed his 
cheek. &quot;How does it feel to be father to three children all at once?&quot; 
she asked her son.

&quot;Good,&quot; he said warmly. &quot;Very good.&quot;

Rippa and Miyage peered over their daughter&#39;s shoulder, and Rippa asked 
gently if she could hold one of the babies. Ki carefully handed Michiru 
to her, then Miyage took Genki in his arms, and Ureshii held Kanpeki. 
&quot;They&#39;ll grow up to be wonderful children,&quot; Rippa said.

Ki lay back on the pillows and smiled back at her mother. &quot;I know, 
they&#39;ll grow up to be two great ladies and a gentleman, people that 
Tadashii and I will be proud to acknowledge as our children.&quot;

&quot;To follow in their mother and father&#39;s footsteps then?&quot;

Ki laughed weakly and returned her mother&#39;s and father&#39;s smile. &quot;Yes, 
that is right...&quot; She yawned and sighed. &quot;I&#39;m so tired, I want to sleep 
but I know I shouldn&#39;t yet.&quot;

&quot;You have every right to be tired!&quot; Ureshii scolded. &quot;Go on, you&#39;ve 
worked hard to bring these babies into the world, you deserve some 
rest!&quot;

&quot;Besides,&quot; Miyage added, &quot;I think Michiru wants to sleep, too; look.&quot;

Everyone but Ki walked over to see Michiru closing her eyes. &quot;Goodbye, 
dear,&quot; 



Miyage said softly as they were leaving. &quot;We&#39;ll visit tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Mmmm hmmm...&quot; Ki&#39;s eyes were closed and she was breathing slower, 
falling asleep.

The grandparents led the children out of the room, Tadashii staying 
behind with Ki, the triplets in his arms, waiting for the doctor or a 
nurse to come in.

&quot;Excuse me, Kaiou-san?&quot;

Tadashii turned to see a tall woman with a dark tan standing there, 
dressed in the nurses&#39; uniform. Her name tag read &quot;Meiou Setsuna.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m here to check on your babies. May I see Michiru please?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; he said, gently handing her into the woman&#39;s arms.

&quot;I&#39;ll bring her back in a moment, I&#39;m just checking her temperature and 
making sure she&#39;s breathing normally.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; he said, then he gave a slight smile. &quot;It&#39;s nice to know 
what you people do when they take her away.&quot;

Her dark red eyes sparkled slightly. &quot;Yes, it is reassuring, isn&#39;t it?&quot; 
She walked out with Michiru in her arms.

&quot;Funny, I have the strangest feeling...&quot; Tadashii murmured as he shifted 
Kanpeki and Genki in his arms. &quot;Nahhh...&quot;

Setsuna went into an empty room, and carefully set Michiru down on the 
bed. She got out the folder of medical records, checked her temperature 
and breathing like she said she would, and recorded them. She smiled 
with amusement as she looked down at the baby. &quot;I&#39;m surprised I was 
allowed to alter all the doctors&#39; and nurses&#39; perceptions to make them 
believe I really am on the staff, even more so that I was allowed to 
borrow the information and skills I needed from one of their minds so I 
could check you out.&quot;

She carefully took Michiru in her arms and smiled again. &quot;You&#39;re 
perfect- ly healthy, I can tell you that,&quot; she murmured, then sighed. &quot;I 
don&#39;t know really what to tell you. I have to make these visits to all 
the Senshi when they are newborn, you know. I&#39;ve had to do this since 
the first Senshi arrived in the Silver Millennium...&quot; She then laughed. 
&quot;Par- don me, I&#39;m supposed to be leaving you a bit of information about 
your _future_,&quot; her eyes shimmered with amusement as she added, &quot;I&#39;m 
supposed to be &#39;cryptic&#39; about it. Ah well...&quot; She sighed again. &quot;I 
can&#39;t say things will be easy. You&#39;re going to be special, I can tell 
you that. So many talents and skills, but you won&#39;t be satisfied with 
it. You&#39;ll find someone though, someone to be happy with, and then 
you&#39;ll realize you never really needed anything else... you&#39;ll know it 
when you first lay eyes upon them... Well, I think that&#39;s about as much 
as I will be allowed to say...&quot;

She brushed her dark green bangs up as her forehead symbol glowed, and 
the symbol of Neptune glowed in sea green on Michiru&#39;s forehead. &quot;Ah, 
good,&quot; she murmured. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll return you to your father now, my 
friend.&quot;

Tadashii, sitting in a chair, was startled out of his doze when Setsuna 
walked into the room with Michiru in her arms. &quot;She&#39;s just fine, Kaiou- 
san, and someone should be in to check the others later,&quot; she told him, 
setting the baby in a crib next to Ki&#39;s bed, where Tadashii had placed 
the other babies. &quot;Farewell, Michiru,&quot; she added as she was leaving.

Tadashii didn&#39;t notice the last comment as he started to doze again. He 
did jump in surprise when a purple light penetrated his closed lids, but 
when he opened them, he saw no one was there. Shrugging, he grinned at 
his new children and fell asleep again.



**********



&quot;Sunao-chan? Sunao-chan?&quot; Teinei gently shook her sister-in-law, who had 
fallen asleep on the couch. &quot;Wake up, c&#39;mon, wake up.&quot; Teinei brushed 
her long strands of strawberry blond hair behind her ear, rolling her 
purple eyes in irritation. She shifted Haruka in her arm and sat down on 
a chair, giving up on Sunao for the moment.

Haruka looked up at her with a tiny gurgle. Teinei couldn&#39;t help but 
grin at her niece. She was an adorable baby, and didn&#39;t give her parents 
much trouble; she was actually rather mild-mannered and rarely cried. 
Teinei sighed and frowned. Katai and Sunao were lucky for that. It had 
been four months now since the twins were born, and the couple still 
hadn&#39;t quite recovered from the sudden death of Akarui. Katai was 
visibly crying as he removed all the boy&#39;s things from the room Haruka 
would now have alone, storing them in the attic in case they were able 
to have a son later. It was obvious that he was crushed though. He 
sought solace in work, working later hours than ever, and working 
harder, taking business trips and going to many dinner meetings. He 
wasn&#39;t seen much anymore since he was gone so much. Whenever he was 
around, he always seemed to be clutching a beer bottle. Sunao had a 
shadow over her, and she probably wouldn&#39;t ever be the carefree, 
light-hearted woman she used to be, but she was recovering, if a bit 
slowly. She wasn&#39;t very focused, so Teinei, Kotori, and Kobun rotated 
between staying at the house with her to help take care of Haruka since 
she couldn&#39;t do it alone, and even when Katai was there, he wasn&#39;t much 
help.

Finally, Sunao stirred, brushing her brown bangs out of her teal eyes. 
&quot;Mmmm... Teinei-chan? Is that you? I must&#39;ve fallen asleep...&quot;

&quot;Yeah, okaa-san told me when I arrived that you were taking a nap on the 
couch. Turned into a very long nap too!&quot; Teinei chuckled and handed 
Haruka over to Sunao&#39;s open arms.

Sunao smiled weakly as she looked down at her daughter. &quot;I&#39;ve just been 
so tired lately, I couldn&#39;t help it.&quot; Haruka whimpered a bit and Sunao 
sighed. &quot;Time for feeding already, Haruka-chan?&quot; She nursed Haruka with 
a wistful smile on her face. &quot;She&#39;s such a darling, isn&#39;t she?&quot;

&quot;She is,&quot; Teinei agreed. &quot;She&#39;s very easy to watch. I almost wish she 
wasn&#39;t so I&#39;d have more to do! All I really do is hold her and talk to 
her and she seems to be happy with it.&quot;

Sunao laughed a bit. &quot;Well, I&#39;m glad for it. I don&#39;t think I could 
handle it if she wasn&#39;t.&quot; She looked down sadly at Haruka when she was 
finished nursing. &quot;I never realized...&quot; she sighed. &quot;Sorry, I shouldn&#39;t 
talk about it, it would be too depressing...&quot;

&quot;Sunao-chan,&quot; Teinei growled. &quot;You&#39;ve been my friend since we were kids. 
You can talk to me about it. And besides, bottling things up will only 
make it worse.&quot;

&quot;All right, you win, as usual,&quot; Sunao chuckled. &quot;I just wish that things 
could have been different, you know? That Akarui could be here too. He 
had his life taken away before he had a chance to live it, and he took a 
piece of us with him.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t say I know the feeling,&quot; Teinei told her, &quot;but I know that it 
must have really affected you and Katai both, and it shows... 
particular- ly in Katai.&quot;

Sunao frowned and sadly murmured, &quot;He told me... He said that if one of 
them had to die, why couldn&#39;t it have been the girl instead? He actually 
told me that... he wanted a son so b-badly, a-and...&quot;

Teinei came over to hug her as she started crying. &quot;It&#39;s not your fault, 
you know,&quot; she said softly. &quot;You both need to move on with your lives. 
If you can&#39;t, what hope does your daughter have, hmmm? She needs her 
parents, especially in these early years, and you have to give her as 
much love and care as you would have even if Akarui had lived.&quot;

Sunao wiped her streaming eyes and nodded weakly. &quot;I... I will... At 
least, I hope I will, I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ll try...&quot;

Teinei chuckled and told her, &quot;You&#39;ll do fine, Sunao-chan.&quot;

Sunao sat quietly for awhile. &quot;How&#39;s the rest of your family?... Katai 
never mentions...&quot;

&quot;Well, Haruka-chan has a third cousin that&#39;s seven days older than her.&quot;

&quot;I never heard about this!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, my cousin had a kid. We never spoke much... Her father and ours 
didn&#39;t get along well. Cute kid though. Name&#39;s Murasaki... You aren&#39;t 
really listening, are you?&quot;

Sunao shook her head. &quot;Sorry.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s ok. C&#39;mon, let&#39;s go get out of the house, get some coffee or 
something. You&#39;ve been cooped up in here for awhile. I know you aren&#39;t 
going to just bounce back right away, but let&#39;s get started, all right?&quot;

&quot;Let me get some things for Haruka first.&quot; Sunao pulled out the stroller 
and got together a bag of diapers, wipes, a pacifier, a small toy, and 
other baby items. They packed everything in the trunk of Teinei&#39;s car, 
Teinei sitting in the front seat with Sunao next to Haruka&#39;s car seat.

They ended up going to a coffee shop to talk for quite a bit, then to 
get Sunao&#39;s chin-length hair trimmed, and before going back home, they 
picked up some things at the grocery store.

When they got back, it was already dark, and Katai was home from work 
early, not a common occurence. Teinei left after dropping off Sunao and 
helping her bring everything inside, stopping briefly to say &#39;hi&#39; to her 
brother.

&quot;How was your day?&quot; Sunao asked her husband as she lay Haruka in her 
crib.

&quot;The usual,&quot; he murmured, taking a sip of his beer. &quot;Hectic.&quot;

Sunao brushed a few strands of hair from Haruka&#39;s face as the baby 
slowly fell asleep. &quot;I had a long talk with your sister today. I&#39;m 
feeling a lot better now actually.&quot;

&quot;You feel better about what?&quot; Katai sat down on the couch, patting the 
cushion to indicate for Sunao to sit next to him. &quot;And what did you talk 
about?&quot;

Sunao sat down, brushing her hair behind her ears, and replied, &quot;We 
talked... about many things really. But I think,&quot; she paused and sighed, 
&quot;I think I can move on now with my life. We&#39;ve been held back these past 
few months by Akarui&#39;s death, and while we most certainly should mourn, 
we do have to move on. Haruka will depend on us for a long time, and we 
have to take care of ourselves instead of wallowing in grief.&quot;

Katai&#39;s dark scowl made Sunao flinch slightly. &quot;Sunao, our son _died_ 
when he was barely minutes old. We didn&#39;t have a chance to raise him. We 
should not forget about it and just &#39;move on&#39;--&quot;

&quot;Katai! I am not saying we should forget! I&#39;m just saying... look, we 
can&#39;t change what happened. Maybe we can make up for it somehow, have 
another child, but we shouldn&#39;t be so caught up in sadness that we don&#39;t 
even try to live our lives anymore.&quot;

Katai stood up and left the room.

Sunao looked down at her hands and sighed bitterly. &quot;This was a 
mistake,&quot; she whispered as her hands trembled. &quot;This whole thing was a 
mistake.&quot;

The phone rang, and Sunao picked it up with trembling hands. &quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;Is Katai there?&quot; The voice was a bit garbled.

&quot;He... can&#39;t come to the phone right now...&quot;

&quot;Oh... Please inform him that... his cousin and her husband were just in 
a car wreck.&quot;

Oh no. &quot;Are they...&quot;

&quot;They didn&#39;t make it... Their baby daughter somehow got out alive 
though.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll tell him. Goodbye.&quot;

She curled up into a ball and cried herself to sleep on the couch while 
Katai lay awake in bed all night.
