<h1>Darkness (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/saiyagurl.html">Saiyagurl87</a><br> </h2>
<pre>One lone figure stood quietly on top of an office building. She was 
hidden by the darkness and the shadows of the night. You could see her 
white pointy fangs flash before the girl liked her lips in hunger. She 
stared down at her prey who was a young male in about his early 
twenties.

The figure had been watching him since he walked out of an house from 
a party he had attended. The male had blonde hair with his bangs 
flipped up. He wore a white t-shirt with a blue denim jacket over it. 
He had on blue jeans and a pair of Reebok sneakers.

The girl had watched and followed the man from the house to an 
alleyway. The girl looked around to make sure no one was around before 
she jumped off of the building. She landed on the floor without a 
sound behind the young man.

She walked up behind the young man and grabbed him tightly. The young 
man let out a startled yelp and tried to escape. The young women held 
him with a strength that no human could comprehend.

She bent the man back and sunk her teeth into the guy&#39;s neck. Her eyes 
turned from a hungry green to a silver color with a tint of blue. The 
man screamed and hollered as his blood was slowly being taken from 
him.

Nobody could hear the man as his screams died down to nothingness. The 
man laid limply in the girls arms as she continued to suck out his 
blood. The man&#39;s blue eyes rolled to the back of his head until his 
eye lids closed.

When the man was sucked dried the girl licked up the dripping blood 
from the man&#39;s neck and then licked her own lips. She lightly laid the 
man down and walked out of the alleyway as if nothing happened.

The girl licked her lips again as she stepped under the street lights. 
The young girl looked to be about 16 with long silver hair which was 
up in a high ponytail. She had silver eyes with a tint of blue to 
them. She had on a visor cap which was worn backwards.

The girl wore a black tube top with a black silky button up shirt. The 
first two buttons of the shirts were left undone and the rest of the 
buttons were done up only to were her stomach would show. She had on 
black leather pants that hung to her hips and legs lightly. She also 
had on black leather boots to complete her outfit.

She walked down the street to find her black motorcycle she parked off 
in the distance. As she continued her walked she smiled at some of the 
people whole still hung around on the streets, bewildered as to what 
had happened only moments ago.

&#39;What fools they are.&#39;, thought the girl as she kept her pace. &#39;These 
humans don&#39;t know that there&#39;s danger lurking in every corner.&#39; As 
soon as she made it to her black motorcycle she climbed on and took 
off down the street.

She watched as lights buzzed by until she made it to her apartment 
that she shared with her older twin brothers their girlfriends and her 
girlfriend. She parked her bike in the parking lot and made her way to 
the stairs.

Soon she made it to her door and took out her keys. She unlocked the 
door and walked in. She relocked the door and saw her brother Jet and 
his girlfriend Lita in the den in front of the Television. They had 
the fire going in the fire place as they cuddled up on the couch.

They both turned around when they heard the door close. The two smiled 
at girl as she returned the smile. The girl walked her way through the 
hall and creaked opened her other brother&#39;s bedroom door. She saw her 
brother Tray sleeping with arms wrapped around his girlfriend Mina.

She closed the door quietly and made her way towards her bedroom. She 
opened up the door to see her girlfriend sleeping on their large bed. 
The girl smiled and made her way towards her dresser. She pulled out a 
pair of black sports shorts and a black tank top.

She made her way towards the bed where her lover Rei slept. The girl 
crawled on the bed as she saw Rei shift and turn towards her. Her 
lover opened up her violet eyes and smiled up at her. Rei pulled the 
girl down into her arms.

&quot;So Serena, how was your hunt.&quot; asked Rei.

&quot;It was delicious&quot;, replied Serena as she kissed her lover and curled 
up in her arms.
