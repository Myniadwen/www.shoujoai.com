<p><em>The young fan  yelled for all to hear, “Aino Minako was staying </em>here<em>!”</em></p>
<p><em>Minako  scrambled to finish dressing, as Rei got up to reprimand the girl.</em></p>
<p><em>Both could  already hear the loud pattering of feet.</em></p>
<p>“Aiko-san,  what did I tell you about opening doors- especially <em>my</em> door?”</p>
<p>Aiko Sakura bowed  her head in apology, though her eyes were still surreptitiously  trying to glimpse Minako from around her mentor's body. “I'm sorry,  Rei-sama. I know I should at least knock before o- waiting.”</p>
<p>Rei glanced behind  her shoulder to be greeted by a now fully clothed Minako, who was  just adding her hat for balance. She was just in time to meet the  eyes of three insistent young fans in shrine robes, eyes glittering.</p>
<p>“It  really is her!”</p>
<p>“Aino-san,  Aino-san, can we please have your autograph? Pretty  please?”<br />
  “Rei-sama, do you know Aino-san? Aino Minako?”</p>
<p>Rei sighed as she  looked from her students back to Minako, who had come up behind her  and placed a hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>Minako smiled as if  this was all too normal for her, which it likely was. “You wouldn't  happen to have any pens or papers for autographs would you? I don't  mind, but I didn't bring any with me.” She grinned at Rei. “I  never would have imagined that the great Rei-sama would allow Minako  fans to stay at her shrine.”</p>
<p>She giggled slightly  as Rei glared at her. She had made it a point in Minako's company to  never show any remote sense of approval for Minako's fame or  merchandise. Which made it essential that her students did not give  away her secret, which they seemed willing to do at this point.  “Well? Have you, or haven't you? She doesn't have all day you  know!”</p>
<p>As soon as the four  had scattered to their rooms to find the necessary items, Minako  whispered into her ear, an eye keeping a look out for returning fans,  “Actually, I may not have <em>all</em> day, but I have all but three  hours of the day. Just a radio broadcast and a little visit to the  mall for signing, and then I'm free.”</p>
<p>Rei turned to look  at her. “And what will the great Aino-sama do with all her free  time?”</p>
<p>“I  can't spend it with you?” was Minako's innocent reply.</p>
<p>Rei scoffed. “I  have work here to do. And you know Usagi-chan and the others will be  wanting to see you.”</p>
<p>“Will  you come by later if your work is done?”</p>
<p>Rei turned her head  absently towards the torii (shrine entrance?). “Maybe, maybe not.  It's a lot to do.”</p>
<p>Minako considered  her options, and was about to ask if she might lessen the load a  little, before the fans came from all sides, showering her with  merchandise, paper, and pens galore.</p>
<p>“Could  you sign this shirt, Aino-san?”</p>
<p>“Can  you sign this CD jacket, Aino-san?”</p>
<p>“Can  you personalize it on this poster and sign this paper?”</p>
<p>“Can  you make it out 'with love to Misha'?”</p>
<p>Rei sighed as Minako  gave them her winning smile and led them over to the edge of the  patio where she could sit with her feet dangling as she signed away.</p>
<p>Sakura, having been  first in line, hung back with Rei as she waited for the others to  finish. “Rei-sama, if I may ask, what were you... you and  Aino-san...” Sakura coughed and blushed, unable to continue.</p>
<p>Rei sighed, knowing  the others were listening. “We-”</p>
<p>One of the boys  asked, “Are you two secret lovers?”</p>
<p>Had Rei been the one  signing, she surely would have messed up the signature horribly, but  Minako was well practiced at this by now. In fact, it was she that  answered as she continued writing, “No, nothing like that. We've  known each other for a long time now- Rei-chan's my best friend, and  I stayed over so we could have a little fun catching up. You just  caught us in the middle of changing, that's all.”</p>
<p>Sakura blushed, her  head bowed once more. “I apologize, Aino-san, Rei-sama, for  invading privacy like that.”</p>
<p>Rei sighed, holding  her temples with one hand. “If Minako doesn't mind, then I'll...  I'll let it go, I guess. It's not like you haven't already got a  mountain of punishments to finish from all your other misdemeanors.”</p>
<p>Minako giggled  quietly for a moment, hearing the pout in Sakura's voice.</p>
<p>The two boys present  were held spellbound.</p>
<p>“'Rei-chan'...”</p>
<p>“Mi...na...ko.”</p>
<p>Rei snapped before  they got any ideas, “Just because <em>we</em> use that level of  honorifics doesn't mean <em>you're</em> allowed to. I'll kill any one  of you that calls me '-chan'.”</p>
<p>All four disciples  sat straight up, looking as if they were a hair's breath from  saluting. “Hai! Rei-sama!”</p>
<p>Minako couldn't help  but giggle more. As she moved on to the next fan, the other girl  asked quietly, “Does Rei-sama get free concert tickets?”</p>
<p>One of the boys  added, “Do <em>we</em> get free tickets for being the students of  Aino-san's best friend?”</p>
<p>The other boy  agreed, “That's gotta count for something, right?”</p>
<p>Rei let out an  aggravated growl. The boys responded with a frightened yelp and  backed up from their excited leaning closer to the idol.</p>
<p>Minako let out  another small giggle before she calmly answered, “I've <em>tried </em>to  give Rei-chan free tickets before but she never seemed to want to  take them... such a pity... and I'm afraid I have no reason to  present the students with free tickets if the teacher doesn't want  them...”</p>
<p>Rei glared daggers  at the back of Minako's head as three of the four miscreants rushed  to plead with Rei to take the tickets, ask how she could possibly  refuse them, and so on until Rei growled, “Enough! I don't care to  because I don't care to. Continue this line of thought and I'll be  sure to double your workload for the next two weeks.” She eyed all  of them one by one, seeing if any would dare speak up. None did. She  relaxed, satisfied.</p>
<p>Minako finished,  giving the last one to Misha before she stood up. “Rei-chan, did  you happen to see what time it was?”</p>
<p>Sakura chirruped,  proudly providing her watch, “It's 9:34!”</p>
<p>Rei's eyes widened  as she realized it was time for one of her more strict sponsors to  come on their monthly visit. Minako noticed her instantly troubled  look and stepped forward, whispering into the ear away from the  students. “You have my cell phone number. Call me when you're done  and I'll tell you where we are. And since I know you're bound to be  busy now, I'll just let myself out, yes?”</p>
<p>Minako bent forward  just the tiniest of millimeters and gave Rei's ear a small peck  before stepping back. She smiled as she waved, “Bye-bye, Rei-chan.  I'll see you later, okay?”</p>
<p>Still stunned, Rei  nodded. “B...ye.”</p>
<p>The fans insisted on  escorting Minako to the torii at the very least, though Rei had to go  straight to her visitors lest any more tardiness infuriate them.  Sakura, who had seen the small kiss, chose to follow her mentor  quietly.</p>
<p>As soon as Minako  got into her black car, this one driven by her for personal use, she  turned on her cell phone. Within a second, it started to ring. She  sighed, pulling away from the curb of the alley behind the shrine as  she put the earpiece on and answered the call.</p>
<p>“It's  Minako. ... Yes, I know, I'm on my way. Why am I late? What else? I  overslept. Rather, more like I forgot to set an alarm. Hm? Why would  I lie to you, Manager? Oh, come on, that was <em>one</em> time! I  promised I wouldn't do that again! Crystal Station? Yes, I know where  it is. Of course I'm sure- I've lived here most of my non-traveling  life, Manager! Okay, okay, I'll be there in... um... twenty minutes.  Is that all right with you? Yes? Okay, then see you then. I'll call  if something comes up, yes. Bye.”</p>
<p>Minako sighed as she  hung up. She glanced at the phone, debating whether she should call  Usagi before or after her work, giving her time to prepare or letting  the ex-princess see her right after hearing from her. There was also  the notion that Usagi would talk her ear off and she'd have to hang  up on her mid-sentence if she didn't want to be any later than she  already was. Minako chuckled at the thought, but decided it would be  best if she didn't call beforehand. Though... if she called one of  the other girls and let them <em>relay</em> the message...</p>
<p>At a traffic light,  Minako scanned her phonebook and found Makoto's flower shop number.  After setting it to dial, Minako focused on the road.</p>
<p>“Oak  Ev. Flower Shop, this is Makoto speaking. How may I help you?”</p>
<p>Minako hid her  giggle as she answered diplomatically, “Good morning, I was  wondering if I might set up an appointment to meet you and your  acquaintances for lunch later today.”</p>
<p>There was the  slightest pause on the other end. “Minako? Is that you?”</p>
<p>The giggle escaped.  “I suppose you missed my publicized arrival?”</p>
<p>Makoto laughed.  “Well, yes and no. I didn't see it myself- I was talking with a  client then- but the next client that came in, she likes to gossip  and talk about things like that, she as good as described everything  down to the color of your nail polish for me.”</p>
<p>Minako checked her  fingers absently. It was the clear kind. “And what did she say that  was?”</p>
<p>“Umm...  I wasn't really listening, to be honest. I did catch that you were  back safe and sound.”</p>
<p>“Mm.  I have a live radio broadcast to get to now, so maybe you can switch  it on and listen, and make up for lost TV watching. Oh, and how about  lunch? Are you free at... one?”</p>
<p>“I  can be. I... don't have any scheduled appointments today and Motoki  can watch the shop just fine. Why? Are you planning on having  everyone meet up?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,  if everyone else is free too. Rei said she's busy but she may come,  just late. I was hoping you could call Ami-chan and Usagi-chan and  see if they have plans while I'm at the radio station.”</p>
<p>“Sure.  We're not very busy right now anyway. Where do you want to meet?”</p>
<p>“Do  you think we still have that room at the Crown?”<br />
  “Well... you  know, I'd say yes... but I don't know if we could get you through the  normal Saturday crowds there. Without being seen, you know?”</p>
<p>Minako nodded though  it couldn't be seen. “Ah... well... hm... do you know exactly <em>what</em> kind of business Rei has to do?”</p>
<p>“I  think she's meeting one of the shrine's sponsors today. It usually  doesn't take long really... not more than an hour or two. She takes  care of the bills and everything... helps the students keep the  shrine grounds neat, and then... well... she has taken to teaching  the helpers every so often. But she could probably push that aside,  if you're in town and all.”</p>
<p>“Wow,  you're really informed.” <em>More so than me, but then again, I  always forgot to ask.</em></p>
<p>Makoto let out a  soft laugh. “Yeah, well, she visits on occasion, and Usagi does too  of course, and she's the real brains behind the gossip column.”</p>
<p>“Ehh...  okay, well... do you think it would be too much of a bother to her if  we met up at the shrine?”</p>
<p>“You'd  have to ask her. She changes her mind about that sort of thing a lot.  Or maybe it's just when Usagi asks... She probably wouldn't mind,  despite what she says though.”</p>
<p>“Hmm...  okay then. Let's surprise her. Everyone meet up at one, okay?”</p>
<p>Makoto laughed a  little. “Okay. Anything else?”</p>
<p>Minako thought about  it. “Well, now that you mention it... do you think you could take a  break off from work a little early and cook something for us? I  suddenly find myself craving some of Mako-chan's famous homecooking.”</p>
<p>Makoto laughed at  that. “As her lovely Idol self wishes. I've actually got just the  thing in mind.”</p>
<p>“Okay,  I'll see you then?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,  see you.”</p>
<p>As soon as she hung  up, all later plans taken care of, Minako sighed and leaned back in  her leather seat.</p>
<p>She imagined Rei's  expression when they all came up her steps at once... and giggled at  the expression she saw on Rei's face.</p>
<p>Which reminded her  of this morning, when those kids waltzed in... and she couldn't help  but giggle again, strangely not flustered at being seen without her  pants on. In fact, it was a bit startling to realize that she could  have been in her birthday suit... and not have cared.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it was  the thought that being seen, in that situation, nude, would have  meant that Rei would have had a <em>really</em> good view of her...</p>
<p>And then she  wondered what had happened for her to not mind in the least, thinking  thoughts along this line regarding Rei.</p>
<p>“<em>Are  you two lovers?”</em></p>
<p>Minako sighed  softly. <em>No, but why do I suddenly wish I could have answered  'yes'?</em></p>
