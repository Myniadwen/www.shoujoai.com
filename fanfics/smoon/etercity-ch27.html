<h1>Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo (part 27 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/etercity-ch26.html">Back to Part 26</a><pre>Miki Kaoru smiled slightly, his blue hair simply
styled as he studied the files on his personal
computer, a wafer thin device that projected a crisp
holographic screen. The group sat around a round table
in the upper floors of the Palace, snacks scattered
about as they discussed the business of the day. &quot;It
seems that the ambassador from Mesa wants to appeal
the ban on Nergal ships in Earth space and reopen
formal diplomatic channels,&quot; he noted.

&quot;They don&#39;t ever give up, do they?&quot; Minako Aino asked,
the blonde looking sourly amused as she took a drink.

Queen Serenity looked towards Miki, &quot;They can&#39;t be
serious.&quot;

&quot;Apparently they are,&quot; Miki scrolled through a
document to refresh his memory, &quot;they first state that
the incident that caused the rift has been resolved,
and moreover they&#39;ve changed their business
practices.&quot;

&quot;Business practices?&quot; Endymion echoed, his distaste
evident as he continued on, &quot;don&#39;t they mean slavery?&quot;

Serenity shook her head, her almost white-gold hair
glimmering. &quot;Have they changed, Minako?&quot; she asked her
softly.

&quot;No,&quot; Minako said flatly before elaborating, &quot;Nergal&#39;s
shipping line is still using the Ruri clones as part
of their shipboard navigation systems out in the
League of Non-aligned worlds and over in the Khanite&#39;s
territory, as well as providing genetically engineered
Boomeroids through their operations based on Mesa.&quot;

Saionji turned from where he stood by the window, his
long green hair flowing down his back. &quot;I almost wish
we had pushed through with an attack on Nergal&#39;s
headquarters on Mesa when we had the chance,&quot; he
admitted.

&quot;That&#39;s against our ethics, Saionji,&quot; Serenity was
faintly scolding.

&quot;So is everything on Mesa, more or less,&quot; Saionji
answered wryly.

&quot;What sort of official response do we want to make?&quot;
Minako asked, trying to steer them back on topic once
more.

&quot;Until Nergal and their business associates
demonstrate a serious effort to align all of their
operations with the standards of Earth and it&#39;s
allies, we cannot allow them to operate in Earth
space,&quot; Serenity said formally.

&quot;Translated out of diplomatic speak that means, &#39;Not a
chance in hell,&#39; &quot; Endymion said with a faint smile.
He frowned as he remembered, &quot;Speaking of Mesa is
there any progress on illegal boomeroid smuggling?&quot;

Makoto spoke up for the first time, the brown haired
woman smiling grimly. &quot;The police force can spot
individual shipments but we&#39;re having problems getting
back to the source,&quot; she quietly explained. &quot;Cyber Six
and the Knight Sabers have taken an interest, so I
suspect things will break soon,&quot; she said.

&quot;Cyber Six is a good detective,&quot; Minako agreed. She
hesitated as she look over at Makoto, &quot;Do you want me
to lend anyone to the police force temporarily?&quot;

&quot;Can I take a rain check on that?&quot; Makoto smiled, &quot;I
may call in Major Motoko Kusanagi, but only if we have
no progress through more conventional routes.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Minako nodded.

&quot;That&#39;s about it for now,&quot; Miki shut down his
organizer, &quot;though I&#39;ll pass on the usual weekly
briefing to all the departments.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Serenity smiled, &quot;thank you for all of your
assistance.&quot; Her eyes brightened as she gazed at the
snacks Makoto had provided, &quot;Not let&#39;s eat!&quot;

As everyone dug in Makoto took Minako aside for a
moment. &quot;I don&#39;t have the sort of intelligence network
you have but I do hear things,&quot; she said, &quot;about a
mystery Senshi.&quot;

Minako munched some cookies, washing them down with
milk. &quot;I heard about her, too,&quot; she admitted, &quot;and
originally thought it was just one of the space
senshi. However eyewitness reports say the uniform
matches ours, though the colors are wrong.&quot;

&quot;How so?&quot; Makoto asked.

&quot;Black bodysuit instead of white like ours,&quot; Minako
said. She frowned, &quot;And no useable photos, of course.&quot;

Makoto grunted her agreement. One of the odd
tendencies of the Senshi was a inability to be
photographed in their transformed state, probably an
aspect of the enchantment that protected their
identities. &quot;Could it be one of the Asteroid Senshi?&quot;
Makoto asked, referring to the four girls who were
once known as the Amazoness Quartet.

&quot;They left Earth System looking for their purpose,&quot;
Minako agreed, &quot;but they always work as a group while
this Senshi fights alone.&quot;

&quot;Could you ask your people to keep an eye on this?&quot;
Makoto asked. She flashed a smile, &quot;I&#39;m not quite as
worried about this as an Outer Senshi might be, but I
don&#39;t like not knowing who this Senshi might be.&quot;

&quot;Will do,&quot; Minako saluted impishly.

Makoto rolled her eyes. &quot;Now if you&#39;ll all excuse me,&quot;
she addressed the whole table, &quot;I have to be going.&quot;

&quot;Where are you headed, Mako-chan?&quot; Serenity asked
curiously.

Surprisingly a faint blush colored Makoto&#39;s cheeks as
she replied, &quot;Actually, Taiki Kou asked if I could
show him around Crystal Tokyo...&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; The entire table focused on Makoto, everyone
looking at her intently.

Makoto went red. &quot;I&#39;m teaching her how to cook,&quot; she
said with whatever dignity she could muster, &quot;that&#39;s
all.&quot;

Endymion smiled, privately relieved that the normally
private Makoto was reaching out to someone who wasn&#39;t
one of her old friends. &quot;Sorry,&quot; he said gently, &quot;we
were just a bit surprised.&quot;

&quot;So what do you have planned?&quot; Minako asked eagerly.

&quot;Take her to some of the nicer restaurants,&quot; Serenity
offered cheerfully.

Miki chuckled, &quot;Or maybe some of the museums.&quot;

&quot;This is not a date,&quot; Makoto reminded them all firmly,
&quot;so don&#39;t go spreading around any rumors like that!&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Endymion saluted, imitating Minako.

Makoto shook her head but she was smiling as she left
the council chamber. &quot;Well what do you all think?&quot;
Serenity asked thoughtfully a few moments later.

&quot;They certainly talked a while at the Christmas
party,&quot; Minako remembered.

&quot;Which doesn&#39;t necessarily mean anything,&quot; Miki
admitted, &quot;but she certainly jumped on us fast about
it not being a date.&quot;

&quot;Methinks she doth protest too much,&quot; Minako misquoted
intentionally.

&quot;We might want to talk to Ami about it,&quot; Serenity
suggested mildly, &quot;she&#39;s always been a bit closer to
Makoto than most of us.&quot;

&quot;I will,&quot; Minako waved her arm enthusiastically, &quot;me,
me!&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Endymion looked at her gravely, &quot;but
don&#39;t try any matchmaking, all right? I know how much
you like to help couples along...&quot;

&quot;Would I do that?&quot; Minako batted her eyes innocently.

&quot;We&#39;re doomed,&quot; Miki sighed.

Serenity chuckled softly, &quot;I noticed you&#39;ve been
quiet, Saionji.&quot;

Saionji smiled back, munching happily on his food. &quot;I
wish her the best of luck,&quot; he said honestly, &quot;she
deserves it, I think.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Minako acknowledged fondly.

To be continued...

Notes: Another Honor Harrington reference! Mesa is a
semi-criminal planet in David Weber&#39;s series, home to
mercenaries, contract killers and the genetic slave
trade. Nergal is from Martian Successor Nadesico, a
company who&#39;s ethics I&#39;ve always had mixed feelings
about.</pre>
