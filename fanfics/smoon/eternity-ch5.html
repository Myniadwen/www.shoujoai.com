<h1>Eternity (part 5 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/saun.html">Saun</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/eternity-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Two weeks later, Michiru handed over a small cup. Haruka took it from 
her while reading over the directions one last time. Two pink lines 
meant they were pregnant. She placed three drops into the little 
indentation and watched as the chemical reaction raced across the slot. 
One pink line . . . She heard Michiru sniffling behind her. It took her 
a moment to register the results before her wife was pressed in her arms 
with tears running down her porcelain cheeks to soak into Haruka&#39;s navy 
dress shirt.

&quot;Michiru?&quot; she whispered unsure.

&quot;It must be hormones,&quot; came the muffled reply.

Haruka allowed herself a grin. If this result was accurate, they were 
going to be parents.

The ultrasound technician moved the sensor over Michiru&#39;s stomach taking 
pictures of her uterus. The couple&#39;s knuckles were white where they 
clenched each other&#39;s hands. After several minutes, the doctor entered 
the room.

&quot;Good news. The test was correct. You are pregnant.&quot; Michiru let out a 
breath. &quot;The ultrasound shows a healthy baby.&quot;

&quot;Only one?&quot; Michiru inquired.

&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; Haruka questioned her. She had heard of cases where one 
twin was hidden behind the other.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid two of the embryos must not have implanted.&quot; The doctor 
paused for a moment letting the news sink in. &quot;But here&#39;s a picture of 
your daughter.&quot; She handed the couple a small printout of a tiny figure 
rendered in sepia tones. Already they could see the outlines of what 
would be her nose and little mouth.

&quot;She&#39;s beautiful,&quot; Michiru whispered, her blue eyes filling with tears.

Haruka felt as if she&#39;d been punched in the gut. She took the picture in 
nerveless fingers.

&quot;Sugoi.&quot;

On the way home they stopped at a small restaurant for dinner. Haruka 
had her usual salad accompanied by a cup of soup. Michiru picked at her 
own chef salad before finally putting down her fork.

Haruka regarded her levelly. &quot;Are you sure that&#39;s enough?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to lose my figure.&quot;

&quot;You won&#39;t. Remember everything Odango ate&quot;

Two identical grimaces appeared, but Haruka didn&#39;t drop the subject.

&quot;Do you want to go get some sashimi?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m a little tired, I think I&#39;d rather just go home,&quot; Michiru 
whispered. Her fatigue was evident.

Haruka chewed a bite slowly. &quot;I think you should eat more first.&quot; 
Silence stretched between them for a moment.

Michiru&#39;s face clearly showed her irritation as she picked up her fork 
in a sharp movement. The blonde didn&#39;t take it personally. She knew that 
hormones were wreaking havoc on Michiru&#39;s body.Haruka ordered dessert in 
hopes of enticing Michiru to eat some of it.

She smiled at her wife.

&quot;I&#39;ll share it with you,&quot; she cajoled. She received an icy glare in 
response. Michiru wanted to go home and she wanted to go home right now. 
Haruka&#39;s own irritation began to rise, but she wisely held her tongue. 
She asked for the dessert to be boxed up. Unfortunately it took an 
extremely long time. When they finally made it to the car, the violinist 
was steaming. Haruka opened the door for her and they drove home in 
terse silence.

When they reached the house, Michiru was out of the car and marching 
into the house at a speed that impressed her wife. When the blonde made 
it inside, the aqua haired woman was already upstairs.

Haruka logged onto the computer and surfed for about 30 minutes, giving 
her mate enough time to get into bed. Haruka then went upstairs and 
changed into her own pajamas quietly before climbing into her side of 
the bed and succumbing to sleep.

Morning came quickly. The blonde hadn&#39;t slept very deeply. She put on 
shorts and a loose community service T-shirt for her morning run. At the 
door she picked up her sneakers before going to sit on the front porch 
and lace them. It looked as though it was going to be a pretty day. Mist 
was rising from the plants and dewdrops glinted in the early morning 
sun. After stretching, the blonde took off at a quick pace. She hoped 
that Michiru felt better, otherwise the next few days might be 
miserable. She made a cautious contingency plan on how to occupy herself 
should it prove necessary to stay out of the artist&#39;s way for a while.

When she got home, she was tired and sweaty, but her head felt much 
clearer. Taking off her shoes and her sweat socks, she put her shoes in 
their proper place and wandered barefoot toward the laundry room. When 
she got to the kitchen, she saw a large traditional breakfast and her 
contrite looking wife. Haruka stood for a moment stunned.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Michiru bowed. When she looked up, Haruka could see tears 
sparking in her blue eyes. She moved forward to embrace the other woman. 
Michiru lightly pulled back making a face. Haruka realized with chagrin 
that she was still holding her sweaty running socks. At that point their 
eyes met and they both dissolved into laughter.

&quot;I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; the blonde excused herself. When she returned, 
Michiru was seated.

&quot;Gomen nasai. I&#39;m just not myself.&quot;

Haruka sat down and silently scooted closer to her mate, pulling Michiru 
into her arms. With the tension gone, they had an enjoyable breakfast 
together before Michiru went to take a nap. Haruka went into the library 
and scanned the ultrasound picture to email to Setsuna and Hotaru.

That night the blonde sat on the couch reading over the sports section. 
Michiru lay with her feet in Haruka&#39;s lap perusing a healthy choices 
cookbook. The violinist was determined that they would eat well for the 
duration of her pregnancy.She wiggled her toes slightly and Haruka ran a 
finger up the center of her foot.Michiru gasped. Haruka chuckled as she 
was lightly kicked. The racer slid a warm enveloping hand around 
Michiru&#39;s foot and squeezed lightly.

&quot;I was thinking of names . . . &quot; Michiru lay her book down on her chest 
and focused on her wife.

&quot;Eh?&quot; Haruka was caught off-guard.

&quot;What about Aiko? Or Hikari?&quot; The artist suggested, thinking of popular 
names from her youth.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; the blonde replied noncommittally.

Michiru thought harder. &quot;Junko?&quot;

&quot;Jun Jun,&quot; Haruka answered, reminding her mate about the asteroid 
senshi.

&quot;Good point.&quot; Michiru sighed.

Haruka paused for a moment, considering how this would sound to her 
lover. &quot;Kazuko?&quot;

Michiru&#39;s eyes narrowed as she considered the choice.

&quot;Kazuko.&quot; The violinist repeated slowly, testing the name on her tongue.

Haruka shrugged and buried her nose in the paper, feeling unsure of her 
suggestion.

Michiru&#39;s arm went to Haruka&#39;s elbow then slid up to her hand. Their 
fingers played together.

Haruka ducked her head then met Michiru&#39;s eyes. They smiled at each 
other.

&quot;It&#39;s what we&#39;ve fought for, ne?&quot; Haruka asked softly.

Michiru nodded. &quot;Hai. This is what we&#39;ve waited for.&quot; Her hand lightly 
touched her stomach. &quot;Kazuko.&quot;

A few weeks later Michiru&#39;s moods had stabilized. She was upstairs 
taking a bath. Meanwhile Haruka was watching TV to distract herself. 
Fevered thoughts kept assaulting the blonde when she thought about 
Michiru&#39;s supple body being lowered into the warm water.

The doctor had prescribed several weeks of abstinence after the 
implantation to allow for the baby to firmly establish itself. Haruka 
missed making love to her wife desperately but she didn&#39;t want to impose 
on her lover. If Michiru wasn&#39;t ready or wanted to wait longer to make 
sure the baby was safe, she would control herself.

She was engrossed in a program about running and optimum conditioning 
techniques when her beloved sat down beside her in nothing but a robe 
and started brushing out her long aqua hair. Haruka could smell the 
intoxicating scent of Michiru&#39;s conditioner. She swallowed and tried to 
bring some moisture back to her suddenly dry mouth. Her eyes were locked 
on the program but she wasn&#39;t processing any of the images she was 
seeing.

Suddenly she felt Michiru&#39;s hand on her thigh, heat surging from it like 
a brand. So aware was she of her mate&#39;s touch that it felt as if she 
wasn&#39;t even wearing pants. Her strong thigh muscles flexed and she 
shifted slightly as desire pooled in her belly.

&quot;Haruka.&quot; Michiru&#39;s voice carried a quiet invitation.

The blonde felt a rush of anticipation and clicked off the television.

They stared into each other&#39;s eyes. Michiru&#39;s fingers lightly traced 
Haruka&#39;s strong cheekbones and jaw. As she moved gently over her wife&#39;s 
throat, she was delighted to feel the blonde&#39;s heartbeat speed up.

The senshi of Uranus&#39; expression was yearning and her eyes darkened 
before closing. Michiru straddled Haruka&#39;s lap and began to kiss her 
neck while playing in her hair.

Haruka&#39;s hands went to Michiru&#39;s back to pull her closer before sliding 
down to cup her bottom.

&quot;On the couch?&quot; she asked huskily.

&quot;Who&#39;s going to see us?&quot; Michiru responded.

Haruka laughed. Then she thought about the coming baby, Hotaru&#39;s 
childhood, and lovemaking being, once again, limited to the bedroom.

&quot;I suppose we&#39;d better enjoy it while we can, ne?&quot; she whispered before 
surrendering herself to the moment.

The next morning, Haruka tossed the mail on the kitchen table before 
heading to the refrigerator for a glass of juice. Michiru sorted through 
it although there wasn&#39;t much there: a statement on their investments, 
promos for her favorite store&#39;s preferred customer program, one of the 
three car magazines to which Haruka subscribed and a letter. She broke 
the seal with a perfectly manicured nail.

&quot;Who&#39;s it from?&quot; Haruka looked curiously over her shoulder.

&quot;Setsuna,&quot; The violinist shared happily. &quot;She has taken leave next month 
and she&#39;s coming for a visit.&quot;

&quot;Honto? Sugoi!&quot;

&quot;Happy Anniversary you two!&quot; Michiru read with a smile. They had planned 
a quiet evening at the house to celebrate. &quot;It&#39;s terrible isn&#39;t it, just 
wanting to stay home on your anniversary.&quot; The violinist sighed.

&quot;Maybe we&#39;re getting old,&quot; Haruka deadpanned.

To her surprise Michiru winked at her. &quot;&#145;The heart that loves is forever 
young, &#39;&quot; she quoted, lightly rubbing her nose against Haruka&#39;s.

The blonde smiled also.

&quot;It&#39;s a full moon tonight.&quot; the artist informed her mate.

&quot;I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not out driving then,&quot; Haruka said thinking of all the 
near misses she usually had when the moon was waxing.

&quot;Let&#39;s go for a walk,&quot; Michiru said softly.

They wandered outside into the warm evening. Since a normal life was all 
they had ever wanted, they happily indulged in the normalcy of the 
moment. Michiru breathed deeply of the fragrant night blossoms. She and 
Haruka strolled in the moonlight. The blonde wrapped an arm around her 
waist. A neighbor just getting home from work waved to them in the 
twilight. They returned the gesture. The air grew heavy and fireflies 
came out to light the world in sparkling flashes.

&quot;Hotaru,&quot; Haruka said smiling. They held hands as they slowly made their 
way back to the house.

Michiru went immediately to the kitchen and pulled a little box out of 
the freezer.

&quot;Is that it?&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot;

The top tier of their wedding cake was carefully preserved and protected 
from freezer burn.

&quot;Do you think it will taste ok?&quot;

&quot;I followed the directions, so it should be fine. People do this all the 
time.&quot;

Haruka was skeptical. &quot;Hmm. If that&#39;s true then why don&#39;t they freeze 
birthday cakes.&quot;

&quot;Because you get a new one every year,&quot; Michiru answered easily. &quot;But if 
you&#39;re lucky, you only get one wedding.&quot;

&quot;I intend to be lucky.&quot; Haruka kissed Michiru&#39;s cheek.

&quot;Ah.&quot; The violinist made a sound of contentment.

Michiru made a simple dinner that night of things they already had on 
hand. Haruka took out two wineglasses and poured some low acid grape 
juice for them both. Michiru had made a tiny hors d&#39;oeuvre platter with 
baby shrimp and cheese with buttery crackers. She&#39;d also found a tin of 
caviar. They lit candles in the living room and, while dinner was 
baking, they curled together on the couch to look at their wedding 
pictures. The violinist alternated feeding Haruka and herself while the 
blonde turned the pages.

The bridal portraits were beautiful. There was one particular close up 
that emphasized Michiru&#39;s joy-filled eyes.

&quot;I really like this one.&quot; Haruka commented softly. &quot;You look so happy.&quot;

&quot;I am very happy.&quot;

&quot;You were so attractive,&quot; the violinist observed as they found a shot of 
a serious looking Haruka just before the ceremony. She kissed just 
behind her wife&#39;s ear. &quot;Still are.&quot;

&quot;Eh, well I try.&quot; Haruka winked at her wife.

There was a picture of the queen surrounded by the four inner senshi all 
smiling brightly and shooting peace signs.

&quot;They look like they did in high school,&quot; Haruka mused.

Michiru nodded taking a sip of her juice. &quot;That was a good shot.&quot;

&quot;Here&#39;s a great one.&quot; It was Setsuna with her arms wrapped around Hotaru 
from behind.

&quot;I miss them.&quot; Michiru sighed.

&quot;I do too,&quot; Haruka agreed.

Haruka flipped to a page that held pictures from the reception: Uranus 
in her dress posing and smiling brightly for the camera, Neptune 
throwing her bouquet, the two of them dancing, lost in their own little 
world together.

&quot;How could we have forgotten some of this?&quot; Michiru&#39;s voice was faintly 
amazed.

&quot;Hai,&quot; her wife agreed.

The oven chimed and Michiru went to get dinner out of the oven, while 
Haruka gathered the silverware.

They set the table while a recording of them playing together flowed 
through the speakers.

Michiru served dinner then excused herself to change into &quot;something 
more comfortable.&quot;

When she returned, Haruka was rendered speechless. Her wife smiled 
brightly at her as they sat down to enjoy dinner. Haruka kept shooting 
glances at Michiru. The violinist was wearing one of Haruka&#39;s white 
dress shirts and what appeared to be nothing else. The shirt was 
unbuttoned down to just above her breasts. Its bottom brushed her thighs 
but every now and again would part when she shifted giving the blonde 
views of interesting shadows she was certain she would like to explore 
more intimately.

Michiru tossed her hair again and leaned across the table after the 
butter. Her breasts were pressed up and plumped. Haruka drank deeply 
from her water glass. The last straw came when Michiru &quot;accidentally&quot; 
dropped her napkin and bent to pick it up.

When she stood up again, the artist found herself swept off her feet and 
being carried upstairs.

&quot;What about dinner?&quot; she whispered.

&quot;I&#39;ve always been a fan of eating dessert first.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I remember. Cookies for dinner.&quot; Michiru giggled at the memory.

&quot;Hush.&quot; Haruka interrupted lightly as she kicked their bedroom door shut 
behind them.

Several hours later the tousled pair made their way back downstairs. 
Michiru pulled their wedding cake out of the cake dome and rolled up the 
sleeves of her robe before reaching for a knife. Haruka got a plate and 
a fork. Michiru tenderly fed the blonde the first bite.

&quot;Well?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s good,&quot; Haruka whispered as she closed her eyes. She was instantly 
transported back to that joyous day by the remembered flavor. As she 
turned to reach for a napkin, the light caught a small bruise that was 
forming on the blonde&#39;s strong throat.

&quot;Oh. I got you,&quot; Michiru commented, running her finger over the spot.

Haruka smiled ruefully. &quot;Hai, but it doesn&#39;t hurt.&quot;

&quot;Gomen.&quot; Michiru lightly kissed the darkened place.

The blonde looped her arms around the violinist. &quot;I&#39;ll take love bites 
from you any day.&quot;

They smiled into each other&#39;s eyes.

Michiru took a fork full of cake.

&quot;Ut-uh.&quot; Haruka took it from her. &quot;That&#39;s my job.&quot;

Michiru took the bite and chewed slowly savoring it She swallowed then 
leaned forward to give her wife a slow kiss like the one they had shared 
a year ago.

&quot;Mm . . . that is good.&quot;

&quot;I know what you mean.&quot; Haruka eyed the confection. &quot;I didn&#39;t think it 
would still be that good after a year.&quot;

&quot;Silly.&quot;

&quot;Nani?&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t talking about the cake.&quot;

The next morning at exactly 9:30 a.m. teal eyes snapped open. The lithe 
blonde rolled over and eyed her lover critically.

&quot;How do you feel?&quot;

Michiru smiled brightly, her cheeks had a rosy glow. &quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; She set 
down the book on pregnancy she&#39;d been reading.

Haruka&#39;s gaze rested on her wife. She searched the beautiful features 
but the only greenish tint came from the swath of aqua curls framing her 
mate&#39;s radiant face &quot;Not sick?&quot; the blonde asked unconvinced.

&quot;Nope!&quot; Michiru rolled out of bed and threw her robe on before padding 
out of the bedroom toward the kitchen. &quot;What do you want for breakfast?&quot;

&quot;Whatever you&#39;re craving,&quot; Haruka answered.

Michiru gave her strange look and disappeared down the hall.

&#145;Still no morning sickness?&#39; the blonde wondered with a shake of her 
head. She brushed at her bangs. Of course this was Michiru who had stood 
calmly on deck when their cruise ship had clipped that tropical 
depression. Even Haruka had been below stairs dry heaving long after her 
lunch had come up.

It wasn&#39;t that Haruka wanted her to have morning sickness, but after 
reading all of the literature at the fertility clinic, both while they 
harvested Michiru&#39;s eggs and while recovering after they had taken her 
own, she had had the usual sequence of events in mind.

Haruka pulled off her boxers and tugged on a pair of blue and white 
striped pajama bottoms to ward off the morning chill. She headed for the 
kitchen. Michiru was setting out breakfast that consisted of cut up 
fruit and a few other foods that they had developed a taste for over the 
years. Haruka couldn&#39;t quite get used to this. No more reporting for 
duty. No having to steal moments together. They had a hefty pension, a 
house on the beach, and each other. Now there was a baby on the way - it 
was miraculous and she was more content than she could have ever 
imagined</pre>
