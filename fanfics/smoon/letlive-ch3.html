<p>Ami and the others waited patiently for her mother to walk past  those double doors. Makoto paced back and forth awaiting the news about  her friend. “Stop walking around, you’re making me dizzy,” said Rei as  she fidgeted in her seat.</p>
<p>“I can’t help it. I’m worried about her,” said Makoto as she paced even more.</p>
<p>“We’re all worried,” said Minako.</p>
<p>Ami started to look down and wiggle her toes. <em>Usually isn’t good news if they take so long, </em>she thought. She looked up when the doors opened and saw her mother.</p>
<p>The  lady didn’t look exhausted, but Ami knew she was. All the girls started  to gather around and bombard her with questions. Ami stood by her  mother side.</p>
<p>“Calm down girls. Usagi is stable and put on some  painkillers. She’s fine for now, a little groggy, but she’ll be okay.  If you like, you can go on ahead and see her.”</p>
<p>Everyone except Minako walked past the doors.</p>
<p>“You  guys go on ahead. I’ll meet up with you after I go to the bathroom.”  She waited until all three girls disappeared beyond the doors and  pulled the doctor aside.</p>
<p>“Doctor Mizuno, what <em>exactly</em> is wrong with Usagi? I know that was not just a simple migraine,” said Minako.</p>
<p>The  doctor sighed and answered, “It’s quite complicated. Usagi is suffering  from a brain tumor. I’ve already explained it to her and her family as  well. She has three months left. Our only option is surgery, but  chances success are-”</p>
<p>“-near zero,” finished the pop-idol.</p>
<hr />
Usagi sank into her pillows as she gripped the sheets of her bed. She tried to digest everything Doctor Mizuno told her. <em>Collapsed…tumor…surgery. </em>It  replayed in her mind over and over like a broken record. At least the  painkillers were working because everything seemed weightless around  her. The door opened and she saw Ami, Rei, and Makoto walk in.
<p>“Hey,” she said as she forced a smile.</p>
<p>“How you feeling?” said Makoto as she stood at the side of Usagi’s bed.</p>
<p>“Wonderful,” said Usagi sarcastically.</p>
<p>She  couldn’t tell her friends. It would break their hearts. Rei stood  behind everyone not wanting to show Usagi how incredibly worried she  was. The only other person she saw in the same condition was Minako,  and she couldn’t bear losing another friend again. It was too painful,  even just thinking about it made her heart feel heavy. Minako finally  walked into the room.</p>
<p>“Minako!” exclaimed Usagi weakly.</p>
<p>The  pop-idol nodded and smiled. Usagi looked at her and gave a peace sign.  She seemed to be the usual happy go lucky Usagi. It didn’t even seem  like she even knew about the brain tumor that slowly took her away.  When Minako was in that situation, it took her a while to get used to  the news. She looked at Rei, and found that she was standing behind all  the girls<em>. This must be especially hard for Rei. Artemis told me  about how she reacted towards the news about me in the past life. She  puts up boundaries, but deep inside, Rei is very vulnerable. Especially  when it concerns a friend. </em>The miko caught Minako’s gaze and in an  instant they understood each other. Rei was near tears and stepped out  without the other girls noticing.</p>
