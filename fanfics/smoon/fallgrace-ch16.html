<h1>Fallen from Grace (part 16 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blue.html">BluestAngelDust</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/fallgrace-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>Just as Hotaru expected, Rei wasn&#39;t home when she awoke. After they got 
home last night, the miko told her she was going to be at the office all 
morning and for most of the afternoon.

With a large grin, Hotaru opened the cupboard in the kitchen and took 
out a box of waffles. It was the only thing she would eat for breakfast, 
much to Michiru-mama&#39;s annoyance when she was growing up. After pouring 
herself a glass of juice, she waited patiently for the toaster to pop 
up.

Things were getting more and more complicated with Rei. There&#39;s been 
half a dozen times when they almost kissed and an undeniable and 
irresistible attraction. She wanted to confess her feelings to the miko, 
but was far too scared. What if she wasn&#39;t ready for another 
relationship yet? Even though Rei probably knew of her feelings.

Well, she can throw &quot;probably&quot; out the window after last night&#39;s little 
&quot;dedication.&quot;

But even with this chaotic mess, Hotaru still felt... happy. Living with 
Rei was like a dream come true, well, all the emotional turmoil wasn&#39;t 
exactly what she&#39;d had in mind. But even with it, the experience was 
still so special. She learned that the miko loved bacon, eggs sunny side 
up and toast for breakfast. Maybe she&#39;ll cook Rei something else 
sometime just for the heck of it.

The businesswoman was still as sarcastic as ever and damn, could she 
hold her alcohol. Even if she didn&#39;t have her love at the end of this 
stay, she&#39;d have all the memories to keep her from being bitter.

Okay, so the last part was a complete lie but hey, memories were better 
than nothing. Or was nothing better than memories because memories would 
remind her of what she could never have?

&#39;Hold on there, Tomoe, it&#39;s way too early in the morning to get yourself 
this depressed!&#39;

Her cell phone chose that time to ring, playing the familiar Teletubbies 
theme.

&#39;Hey,&#39; she said to herself in exasperation, &#39;at least you&#39;re not stuck 
with that Barney song like Megumi. I am never playing Truth or Dare with 
Hikari again. That girl is evil.&#39;

&quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;Hey, Hotaru!&quot; Sara&#39;s cheerful voice rang out, causing Hotaru to pull 
the phone away.

&quot;Morning.&quot;

&quot;Morning! Are you crazy? It&#39;s almost noon!&quot;

Hotaru rolled her eyes and grabbed her waffles as they popped up from 
the toaster. Rei ran out of maple syrup yesterday and she forgot to tell 
the miko. Damn.

&quot;It&#39;s morning for me.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah you lazy bum. Anyhow, where are you?&quot;

The college student rolled her eyes again and took a bite out of her 
waffle. What Sara meant was, &#39;Are you still at Rei&#39;s?&#39;

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m still at Rei&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Ahh! Oh my god! Are you serious!&quot;

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m serious.&quot;

&quot;Oh god! You&#39;re so lucky! Rei&#39;s so hot!&quot;

Hotaru wondered why Sara was the lesbian out of her three friends. 
Megumi would have a made a great butch and Hikari was so femme it was 
scary. But Sara? She was the shopaholic valley girl.

&#39;Sure you&#39;re not just worried that Rei might like her better than you? 
Sara IS the type she goes after.&#39;

The violet-eyed girl shook her head to clear her thoughts, noticing that 
Sara was actually speaking.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I said, &#39;how&#39;s living with her?&#39;&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s... okay.&quot;

&quot;Just okay. Right.&quot;

&quot;Sara...&quot;

&quot;Okay, okay. Anyhow, I called to ask what you&#39;re doing tonight.&quot;

&quot;Hmm? Oh, nothing I guess.&quot;

&quot;Really? Rei doesn&#39;t have plans for a romantic dinner at The Tower 
followed by a moonlight stroll on the beach where you two undress each 
other in a passionate frenzy and have world shattering sex till dawn?&quot;

Hotaru learned long ago how to ignore Sara&#39;s perverted fantasies, but 
this one caused her to almost spray her juice all over the table. She 
could imagine the huge grin on the blonde&#39;s face, brows quirking up and 
down suggestively. The college student smiled wickedly and lowered her 
voice to a husky whisper.

&quot;No, but I&#39;d rather be with you than her any day.&quot;

Sara&#39;s laughter echoed in Rei&#39;s empty apartment as Hotaru held her cell 
away from her ear. She smiled smugly, wishing she had enough guts to do 
that with the miko and not just her classmate.

&quot;Oh god, Hotaru, you almost had me. But really, you should have tried me 
first. I was more than a little willing.&quot;

Hopping down from the stool, the short girl walked to the sink and 
washed her glass.

&quot;Sara, I&#39;ve had a crush on Rei long before I even met you. And besides, 
you&#39;re not my type.&quot;

&quot;What? Not tall, dark and sexy enough for you? Would it help if I dyed 
my hair black?&quot;

&quot;Dear lord, please don&#39;t. But it&#39;s not only that, anyhow. Rei&#39;s-&quot;

&quot;Okay, before you start on that dreamy speech about how perfect your 
love is...&quot;

&#39;Rei is far from perfect,&#39; Hotaru found herself thinking.

&quot;Do you know about that traditional festival tonight?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;Figures,&quot; Sara drawled. &quot;There&#39;s a traditional festival tonight. You 
game?&quot;

Normally, Hotaru would jump at the chance to go to a traditional 
festival. But she wasn&#39;t at home and bored out of her mind this time. 
She was at Rei&#39;s, living with the person she loved.

&quot;I think I&#39;m going to skip this one.&quot;

&quot;What! Hotaru, are you sure? Is Rei trying to keep you locked up but not 
get horny? If she is, I&#39;ll-&quot;

&quot;Join in?&quot;

The expected laughter never came. With a tired sigh, Hotaru sat down on 
the couch.

&quot;It&#39;s not that. I&#39;m sure Rei would want me to go and have fun. But I 
shouldn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Have fun?&quot;

&quot;No, leave her.&quot;

Silence. The youngest senshi played with the frayed hem of her favorite 
tank top. It was unnerving whenever Sara&#39;s quiet. It meant she was 
thinking hard, a little too hard...

&quot;Are you sure? Hotaru, it&#39;s one thing to love someone, it&#39;s another to 
plan your life around them. Especially if they-&quot;

&quot;I know, I know. But it&#39;s not even that. I&#39;m her guest, I can&#39;t just up 
and leave.&quot;

&quot;So tell her you&#39;re going out.&quot;

&quot;Sara...&quot;

&quot;Fine. Just make sure you know what you&#39;re doing, okay?&quot;

&quot;Yes, mother.&quot;

&quot;Shut up. Well, I&#39;m going to go break the news to Hikari and Megumi.&quot;

&quot;Thanks. I&#39;ll see you around?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, bye Hotaru! Have crazy sex with Rei!&quot;

Before Hotaru could comment, the line went dead. Violet eyes narrowed in 
annoyance. The blonde was so dead the next time she saw her.

Hotaru was lying on the couch, counting the imaginary dots on the 
spotless ceiling. It was so boring, there was nothing to do! She learned 
a while ago that fan fiction could only provide so much entertainment 
before you either got tired of it or read everything. Maybe a good 
Hermione/Draco was up...

For the sixth time in an hour, her cell rang. The girl sat up with a 
growl, ready to yell at Sara. The question the girl asked the last time 
she called was still fresh on her mind as she picked up her phone.

&quot;No, I will not have sex with you!&quot;

&quot;Wow, do you answer your cell like this all the time? I&#39;m sure Ruka 
taught you that one...&quot;

Hotaru felt her cheeks and ears burn with embarrassment as she collapsed 
on the couch, shocked.

&quot;Ahh... eh-R-Rei?&quot;

&quot;Hello, Ru,&quot; came the soft chuckle.

With a groan, the young woman swore that she was going to kill Sara, but 
after she tortures her. She... Rei...sex... said no.... awww man!

&quot;What are you doing?&quot;

&quot;I... uh... nothing much.&quot;

Rei chuckled again. &quot;Right, if your greeting is any indication.&quot;

The college student wanted to bury herself in a hole and never come out.

&quot;Anyway, your sex life aside, be ready at six.&quot;

&quot;Six? Why? For what?&quot;

&quot;Because it&#39;s a surprise.&quot;

&quot;Ready as in...?&quot;

&quot;Showered, but not dressed.&quot;

Hotaru flushed as Rei hastened to correct herself. With the greeting and 
sexual tension between them, neither could even mention let such a 
comment go by without images flashing in their minds.

&quot;Be clothed, but not.&quot;

It was the miko&#39;s turn to groan as her explanation got her in deeper 
than she was already. Being eloquent was part of her job description, 
but she had the speaking abilities of a five-year-old around her house 
guest!

&quot;Just... yeah.&quot;

&quot;Six?&quot;

&quot;Yup.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a-&quot;

Hotaru snapped her mouth shut. She was about to say &#39;It&#39;s a date.&#39; But 
that would have created even more problems than it&#39;s worth. Oh god, 
Hotaru! THINK before you speak!

&quot;Hotaru, I have to go. See you tonight.&quot;

The student sighed in relief at not having to finish her sentence and 
started thinking about the surprise.

Rei walked into her apartment with a slight bounce in her step. She 
threw her jacket on the couch, looking around for any signs of Hotaru.

Hotaru. A week ago, the name would have brought happy memories of a 
sweet and adorable child. But now... it was a bombardment of feelings, a 
tingle down her spine with a picture of a mature, not to mention 
beautiful, young woman. The change frightened her as much as it excited 
her.

She looked over at the bathroom door as it opened. And out stepped 
Hotaru... with only a towel wrapped around her slim form.

&quot;Oh god! Rei!&quot;

&quot;Ack! Sorry!&quot;

The miko snapped around, her back facing Hotaru as her she blushed. Did 
they enjoy torturing her up there!

Hotaru felt her cheeks burn as she hurried into the guest room. Rei just 
saw her in nothing but a towel...

Her blush intensified as she scrambled to dress, ignoring her hammering 
heart.

The miko sat on the couch, staring straight ahead. Her house guest was 
far more pleasing to the eye than expected. Even the tightest clothing 
couldn&#39;t show off her modest but gorgeous curves. And the way those dark 
tresses plastered to the ivory skin, framing her face. Let&#39;s not forget 
the water droplets dripping from her chin, over her throat, moving 
across the silky skin with painful slowness and then disappearing under 
the towel and touching her friend&#39;s breas-

&quot;Dear lord, stop! Hino, breathe! Don&#39;t think!&quot;

Rei buried her face into a nearby cushion, pulling on her hair. Hotaru 
was her friend. Not a bed partner. Friend. Friends deserve love. Not 
just sex. Don&#39;t think sex. Don&#39;t think sex. Think safe things. Like 
boobs. No, non-sex related. Whip cream. Non-sex related. Chocolate 
syrup. NON-sex related. Handcuffs. NON-SEX RELATED, DAMN IT!

&quot;Rei?&quot;

The businesswoman sat up and saw her blushing friend standing by the 
entrance of the living room in a Tee and shorts. But she looked so cute!

&quot;Umm... hey.&quot;

&quot;Hi.&quot;

Awkward silence settled over the two. Hotaru willed herself to forget 
the way Rei&#39;s eyes raked over her body. Wanting her. She could feel it 
as the miko did it again now. Love, not sex. Love, not sex.

&quot;So... where are we going?&quot;

&quot;Huh? Right, the traditional festival.&quot;

The tension faded from Hotaru&#39;s mind as she leaned forward slightly, 
smiling. The miko felt her heart skip a beat. Damn, she looked so 
beautiful like that.

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, there&#39;s one in town.&quot;

The college student&#39;s face suddenly fell, causing Rei to stand.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have a kimono to wear.&quot;

Hotaru watched as her love&#39;s face blossomed into a grin, a real, happy, 
unforced grin. The miko walked over to the door and picked up a box. 
Hotaru felt her throat close, staring at the long, white box intently. 
No, she couldn&#39;t have... right?

&quot;Yes,&quot; Rei whispered softly, afraid of ruining the moment, &quot;you do.&quot;

As the businesswoman took off the top of the box, Hotaru tensed with 
anticipation. Her eyes widened as she saw the kimono sitting inside.

Violet eyes gazed into lavender ones, conveying everything that needed 
to be said without words. Rei only gave her a small smile, pushing the 
box into Hotaru&#39;s hands.

&quot;Go change.&quot;

A few minutes later, Hotaru stepped out, blushing softly. It darkened 
when she saw Rei gaping at her.

The kimono fit her perfect, made from the finest white silk. Beautiful 
jasmines (which were what Rei smelled like, Hotaru realized) decorated 
the bottom in a lovely shade of cream, reaching a little past her knees. 
The silky obi was, remarkably, the same shade of lavender as Rei&#39;s eyes, 
causing the younger woman to smile fondly when she saw it. She had done 
her hair in a bun with two tendrils framing her lovely face. With a rosy 
blush, Hotaru looked...

&#39;Absolutely gorgeous,&#39; Rei thought, eyeing her friend, despite her best 
efforts not to.

&quot;So, what do you think?&quot;

Their eyes met as Rei smiled, the first affectionate gleam in her 
lavender orbs in years.

&quot;I think you&#39;re going to get at least 100 numbers tonight.&quot;

Hotaru held a hand to her cheeks, hoping to hide her blush. The miko 
just grinned at the cuteness of the gesture.

&quot;Well, I should go change, though I can&#39;t even begin to compete with you 
in that.&quot;

As the taller woman disappeared into her room, the short-haired girl 
closed her eyes. This was going to be perfect.

Hotaru stayed close to Rei as they walked through the crowd. People were 
rushing from one place to another on all sides, children laughing and 
couples kissing. The hundreds of lanterns that lit the festival from 
above gave everything a golden glow.

Rei, unsurprisingly, wore a red kimono with a violet obi. An orange 
phoenix was embroidered on the bottom, head raised proudly, much like 
the woman that wore it. She looked stunning, the wind playing with her 
hair and a smile on her lips. A smile that reached her eyes, causing 
them to twinkle.

&quot;What do you want to do first?&quot;

Hotaru looked into the eyes of her love, paralyzed by the unguarded 
orbs.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, everything?&quot;

The miko laughed, sending a shiver of pleasure down the short girl&#39;s 
spine.

&quot;Hold your horses. How about one thing at a time?&quot;

Rei was entranced as her companion shook her head, sighing dramatically. 
How can such a simple action affect her so?

&quot;Fine, if we have to.&quot;

Rei rolled her eyes at the childish tone but couldn&#39;t suppress her 
affectionate smile. The first thing she saw was the food stands.

&quot;Have you eaten yet?&quot;

&quot;Nope.&quot;

&quot;Good, neither have I.&quot;

Without a word, Rei grabbed her friend&#39;s hand and dragged her toward the 
source of the delicious aroma. Hotaru stared at their touching hands, 
smiling.</pre>
