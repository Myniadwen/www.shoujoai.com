<h1>False Illusions (part 1 of 1)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ooIbunnioo.html">Ccypr3sst</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I dreamt of you. If I told you, would you believe me? Your eyes tell me you 
would. Beautiful, onyx eyes tell me so. They yearn for me as I do for you. 
Yes, you want me. No, it&#39;s not lust, it runs deeper than just lust. It 
frightens me in a manner none can arise in me other than you. And the 
reaction you bring in me. . . Waiting for me to fall into your flames, don&#39;t 
engulf me yet. Let me lose ourselves in pleasure before you take me. 

I dreamt of you. Would you believe me if I told you a second time? On my 
knees? Curves tell me so. They capture me with flaming tendrils of passion 
that I hope nver to be free of. Strange, is it not, that I am lured to you 
like such. . . when all you do is look upon me? They moan for my touch, even 
moreso your lips. Your lips do not lie as they pull me tighter desperately. . 
. wanting me for yourself. Barely from consiousness, we come together for 
just one last time; surrender to bliss. . . Come, please, hold me close and 
meld as one. 

I dreamt of you. Would you believe me if placed my life on it? You say no. 
You lie yet your body and eyes do not. Your voice betrays us . . . Why? Is it 
duty? While I desire you, you only love me like you love the others. Why? Is 
my love unsufficient? Have I done something wrong? Or, is it another lov-. . 
. Ofcourse, ofcourse. . . always her. It will always be her, not I? How could 
I have not known. . . when it was right before me? I understand. . . 
Falling. . . 

. . .hurts. . .

. . .wish. . .

. . .loved. . .

. . .last time. . .

. . .my beloved. . .
