<p><u>Back  track- In the future, moments before the mysterious drop-in</u></p>
<p><u></u></p>
<p>Soft splashes of waves rang delicately in the air and the  wind ran along a cliff’s edge before playfully flying down to meet  with the sea. In turn the sea’s waves embraced the wind as if  welcoming home an old friend.</p>
<p>“How I envy you.”</p>
<p>A teenage girl looked down from the cliff’s edge, eyeing  the scene that won the intense gaze of her aqua eyes. Although her  body was shielded with a heavy, dark cloak, her slim legs were  virtually left unguarded except for the pair of shorts that clung to  her waist and the pair of shoes on her feet. Sensing her sadness the  wind rose back up to her and played with the girl’s  shoulder-length, sandy blonde hair. The layered golden pieces became  slightly messed. She couldn’t help but grin slightly.</p>
<p>“Stop  that you.”</p>
<p>The indifferent words came out and  had almost fooled the breeze until the wind detected the hidden lace  of humor in her voice. The girl’s sparkling eyes had also given her  away. This time feeling bolder the wind pushed on the small of the  girl’s back towards the water below. For a moment she hesitated but  finally decided to yield to its request. Slowly the teenager started  to carefully scale down the rocky cliff to the smooth beach of sand  below.</p>
<p>“I know, I know, just give me a minute!” She  snapped at the teasing wind.</p>
<p>The girl walked a  quarter way down the beach away from the cliff before sitting herself  down on the sand. Her senses tingled as she took everything in. There  was the sound of seagulls bickering in the sky above. The wind had  turned its attention toward the sea once more and the two played  their game of tag. <em>‘They can act like children sometimes. ’</em> Soon the sea’s flirting waves to the wind escalated in its act,  teasing the tempted wind. Trying to hide its uncertainty the wind  tried harder to dodge the sea’s hugs but the teenager who observed  the scene could see that it was too late because her friend had  already fallen for sea’s charm. With one quick unexpected rise the  sea threw off the wind’s timing and grasped it tightly before the  two elements mixed. ‘<em>Never stood a chance’.</em> The girl shook  her head with a chuckle, She knew the wind was just playing hard to  get and didn’t mind being snared but the episode was definitely  amusing in her mind she decided.</p>
<p>After a short  pause she reflected on her feelings. One feeling in particular grew  stronger by the second. The longing to belong had started to well up  inside her chest. <em>‘Loneliness?’</em> The girl  frowned and shook her head once again but harder. After mentally  slapping herself she realized that she was sweating profusely. One  glance up at the sun was all she needed to confirm her suspicions.  She scowled to let herself be caught up in the moment enough to dull  her senses. Once she was satisfied that she had scolded herself  enough she finally thought out-loud,</p>
<p>&quot;Guess I should do  something about it …” She mumbled.</p>
<p>Without a  second thought the blonde shed the heavy cloak off, allowing it to  fall to the ground with a thump.</p>
<p><strong>Thump</strong> Now on with the cloak on the ground the blue, sleeveless  shirt the blonde wore and her healing bruises on the girl’s arms  were finally exposed. <em>‘Now for the shoes.’</em> Before she  kicked off the loose hanging pieces of leather from her feet a light  bulb lit up in her head. Being bored was something that the blonde  could never stick with. Firstly she pushed herself up to her feet  using her slightly rough hands and then backed up a few steps before  inspecting the long stretch of beach that lay in front of her.</p>
<p>She had  noticed it, sensed it. The pair of dark eyes that had been watching  her since her climb down the cliff. The wind picked up again  revealing the person’s location when a few strands of dark, colored  hair flew up behind the rocky base of the cliff. A mischievous grin  spread itself across the blonde’s face. Bending her knees slightly  she looked down a few seconds before shooting her head up and broke  into a quick accelerating run. Almost immediately after she had  gained momentum the blonde kicked her foot up, allowing the shoe to  fly.</p>
<p><strong>Whack</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Oww!”</p>
<p>“HAHAHAHA!”</p>
<p>The person in hiding stood up still looking startled from  the surprise attack only to see the blonde teenager rolling in the  sand laughing her guts out.</p>
<p>“I got you good Hotaru chan!”</p>
<p>The short, dark haired senshi of destruction felt the  blush of humiliation spread across her cheeks, wanting nothing more  than to strangle the blonde.</p>
<p>“Kaiya!”</p>
<p>The blonde stopped laughing and her head shot up from the anger that  radiated in the voice that called her. The person who was glaring at  her had a light black t-shirt, black shorts and a pair of straw made  sandals on.</p>
<p>“Now your going to get it.”</p>
<p>‘<em>Uh-oh.’</em></p>
<p>“Yaaaaah!” Kaiya let out as Hotaru  tackled her.</p>
<p>Pinning the younger girl down Hotaru  started unmercifully tickling Kaiya.</p>
<p>“No! Stop!  I…Can’t…Breathe!” She gasped.</p>
<p>Hotaru  ignored the girl’s pleas.</p>
<p>“C’mon sis! I give!”</p>
<p>There was a pause, then frowning a bit Hotaru let the  blonde recover her breath. However she let her guard down too quickly  and soon found herself on the receiving end of the  tickles.</p>
<p>“Cheater!”</p>
<p>Their laughter  rivaled the bickering sounds of the seagulls’ and soon dominated,  filling the surrounding area with their voices. It was some time  later when they both declared a truce.</p>
<p>“Truce?”</p>
<p>The blonde’s sister eyed the outstretched hand carefully.  In the back of her mind she faintly recalled falling into this trap  once, allowing herself to be caught by surprise being sent airborne  doing a flip before landing on her back. ‘<em>If she tries it again  she’ll be sorry”.</em> Hotaru met the hand and to her surprise her  sister was being sincere this time. She continued to watch her sister  cautiously.</p>
<p>Kaiya sat down and partially  submerged her feet in the cool water, allowing the sea’s soft  caresses to take her. Half expecting to see Kaiya look at her Hotaru  continued to watch. But Kaiya was looking intensely at something else  with a softened expression in her eyes. Following her sister’s line  of vision Hotaru softly gasped when she finally acknowledged the  beautifully painted sunset in the sky. The two sisters watched the  scene in silence.</p>
<p>Hotaru soon grew tired of  standing and she too soaked her feet after she removed her footwear.  ‘<em>I’m going to need a good sanitizer after this’.</em> There  was a pause in her thoughts. Then the silence was broken when Hotaru  softly asked the question she came to Kaiya about,</p>
<p>“Are you  really going to go?”</p>
<p>Kaiya twitched slightly,  feeling the pain in her sister’s hurt voice. When Kaiya said  nothing, Hotaru continued.</p>
<p>“I miss them too.”</p>
<p>“Miss…who?”</p>
<p>There was coldness in Kaiya’s response. <em>‘You know  who…’. </em></p>
<p>“Our parents, I know you miss them Kaiya,  don’t deny it.” There was more force behind the statement than  the last.</p>
<p>“No I don’t!” Angry flashed in Kaiya’s  eyes.</p>
<p>Partially surprised by Kaiya’s outburst  Hotaru tried to keep her voice calm, and tried again.</p>
<p>“You  still…haven’t forgiven them yet?”</p>
<p>There was  a pause, wind and the sea had both become very quiet, listening in on  the two girl’s conversation. Kaiya face was burning with hate,  something that Hotaru had rarely ever seen. ‘<em>There was only one  other time that Kaiya was like this…’.</em>There was a sad  expression on Hotaru’s face, she wanted more than anything to tell  her sister what she knew but she couldn’t, Setsuna wouldn’t  approve.</p>
<p>“I’m going now.”</p>
<p>“Nani?”</p>
<p>Kaiya had stood up, her face was covered in shadow as she  staggered over to her cloak and shoes. Hotaru stood up as well and  moved cautiously towards her sister. After slipping on her shoes  Kaiya paused, her back still facing Hotaru. She took a deep breath  before asking,</p>
<p>“It’s cold isn’t it?”   Kaiya picked up her cloak and wrapped it around her  shivering sister’s shoulders. Hotaru hadn’t even noticed how cold  she was until her skin felt the warmth emitted from her younger  sister’s cloak.</p>
<p>“Kaiya…”</p>
<p>“mm…?”</p>
<p>Hotaru ran back to the cliff’s edge and recovered a small  black pouch. Kaiya saw uncertainty in the girl’s eyes . Hotaru bit  her bottom lip and then held out the bag for her sister to  accept.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>Hotaru was  looking down, refusing her sister eye contact.</p>
<p>“My most  treasured object…” She whispered. “To bring you good luck.”</p>
<p>Kaiya was stunned. She wasn’t sure what to say but she  settled with,</p>
<p>“I can’t take it. It’s precious to you.”</p>
<p>Kaiya knew her shy sister treasured only a few selective  objects and people. However Hotaru shook her head and began to  insist, pleading in her eyes that Kaiya would understand. Their eyes  met and finally Kaiya caved in. <em>‘I can’t say no to that look’</em> With a sigh she moved her shaking hands to the grasp the small bundle  and then tucked it around a tiny loop on her shorts, allowing the  precious object to hang securely around her waist. When she looked  into Hotaru’s eyes once more the uncertainty that once occupied  those dark orbs had been replaced with a resolved confidence.</p>
<p>“Arigato Hotaru chan.”</p>
<p>Not being very  good with good-byes Kaiya struggled between the want to make a quick  exit and the want to stay with her older sister, but her feeling of  needing to know was stronger.</p>
<p>Turning away from  Hotaru, she started to trudge towards the cliff’s base at the end  of the beach where Hotaru had just returned. This time the dark  haired girl did not follow her sister, holding back the desire she  chose to watch quietly instead. ‘<em>This may be the last time I’ll  ever see her’.</em> Surprised by her own thoughts she quickly shook  her head, replacing the thought with another. <em>‘No, I will her  see her again!’.</em></p>
<p>Kaiya reached her chosen  departure spot and turned around to face Hotaru. Hotaru didn’t need  words to know what her sister was thinking. <em>‘Love you, see you  soon’</em> Kaiya thought. Seeing the understanding glance from  Hotaru, Kaiya raised her hand showing a tiny object clutched in the  palm of her hand. A bright, pink light engulfed her body and she was  gone.</p>
<p>Hotaru watched her sister disappear,  staring into the empty space in front. The wind picked up once more  and petted her hair to comfort the poor girl. A few dusts of sand  flew into the sea.</p>
<p><strong>Plip, Plip.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> Oblivious to her hot flowing tears Hotaru softly whispered,</p>
<p>“Come  home  safe…”</p>
