<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ramblings:  Just warning you, the medical mumbo-jumbo you're about to read is based  off of a true person. Oh and lookit! I wrote a story with only SLIGHT  Usa/Rei themes! DAMN! The apocolaypse is coming!!</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">----------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before  now, Minako thought that Setsuna was the bravest person she knew. The  green-haired woman knew all there was to come, and had experienced all  of life's pleasures and pains.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Though, Minako thought to herself, that was probably a big mistake.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was true that Setsuna could see the future, but she was forbidden to  reveal it. Forbidden to stop time or reverse it. Forbbiden to save  those she loved, forever doomed to watch them grow old and whither  away. Setsuna had to live through life, worrying constantly about the  future and the soilidity of it all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was probably why she'd  overreacted when Usagi declared that she and Rei were an official  couple. Hell, Mamoru had taken it better. All he did was shrug his  shoulders and said, &quot;About damn time.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And know, Minako thought with a grin, this brings us to the present. Setsuna laid in her arms, staring blankly at the wall.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Pardon me,&quot; she asked quietly, a childish look of confusion gracing her normally stoic features. &quot;who are you again?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;I'm Minako,&quot; the blonde answered softly. &quot;I'm a good friend of yours.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Ah,&quot; the woman mumbled as she unconciously snuggled deeper into Minako's arms. &quot;I see.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako giggled and rested her head on Setsuna's head. The happy grin fell from her face as she remembered what Ami had told her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>&quot;Short Circut.&quot; the blunette declared with a grim frown.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>&quot;'Short Circut'?&quot; Makoto asked. &quot;Like a robot?&quot; Ami shook her head and pushed up her glasses.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>&quot;Not  like a machine. Setsuna-san is most likely so used to being in control,  so used to having time flow smoothly around her, the sudden shock and  disruption,&quot; At this, Rei wrapped an arm around Usagi's shoulders and  pulled the moon hime into her arms.<br />
  &quot;, caused something in her brain to, for lack of a better word, short circut.&quot;</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Minako rubbed Setsuna's back, even as the crimson-eyed woman stared blankly ahead. &quot;What do we do?&quot; she asked.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Ami  sighed. &quot;We can't do anything. Most likely, Setsuna-san's memory has  been affected. It may help for her to be in a familiar enviroment.&quot; She  mumbled quietly so that Makoto was the only one to hear her. &quot;And pray  that Minako can save the Setsuna we know...&quot;</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Minako stared at Setsuna with concern.</em> 'Her memory? What if she forgets all of us?' <em>She rested her head on Setsuna's back</em>.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>'What if she forgets about me?'</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako was jolted from her memory as Setsuna yawned. The woman snuggled into the crook of Minako's neck and sighed sleepily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Minako-chan?&quot; the Time Senshi murmured. &quot;Did I ever tell you that you smell nice? Before I lost my my memory?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The comment made Minako blink. &quot;No,&quot; she answered slowly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Setsuna  yawned again and wrapped her in a lose embrace. &quot;You smell  like...a...spring...&quot; her eyes closed as she mumbled the last word.  &quot;...breeze...&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako blushed. <em>'A spring breeze huh?'</em> She closed her eyes and let her mind drift as sleep claimed her. <em>'That's new.'</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  awoke in stages. First, she could feel the comfy sofa underneath her  body, and a warm bundle weighing down her chest. Next, she heard birds  chirping and the breath that tickled her ear. Then, she smelt an exotic  scent tease her nose. Minako groaned and opened her eyes, squinting at  the bright light of the sun.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The warm bundle on her chest was  none other than Setsuna, a hand curled near her face. Her face was  slack and her full lips were slightly parted. Long, slender lashes  starkly contrasted with her moccha colored skin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>'She looks like a sweet little child...'</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  blinked a few times and ran her fingers through the silk that was  Setsuna's hair. She only had a few chances to touch the normally stoic  woman's hair and she grabbed at them with both hands.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Setsuna groaned and shivered, her chest rumbling. Her lips twitched at the corners,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If Minako didn't know any better, she'd say that the Time Senshi was purring like a great, contented kitten.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blonde smiled and settled against the couch. She just didn't have the heart to wake Setsuna. <em>'And besides,'</em> The Senshi of Love thought with a little grin. <em>'Setsuna looks pretty in all her unguarded glory.'</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Setsuna moaned and her eyes fluttered open. <em>'What-?'</em> She noticed that she was draped across Minako, her head nestled in the hollow of the blonde's throat. <em>'How did-?'</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To say that the guardian of Time was confused would be an understatement.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She sat up and blushed when she realized that she was now straddiling her fellow Senshi's waist. <em>'Please don't wake up, please don't--'</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  blinked her eyes open and stared at the embarassed woman. &quot;Good morning  Setsuna-chan.&quot; she said with a dazziling smile. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Setsuna  gulped and silently thanked the girl for not mentioning their  compromising position. She climbed off of Minako and frowned at the  small part of her that missed the blonde's warmth. &quot;I'm fine, thank  you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako's brows furrowed. She missed the feeling of  Setsuna's slight weight and she certaintly didn't like the cold tone  that Setsuna used with her. &quot;You sure?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Guarded ruby eyes turned to her own skyblue ones. &quot;Yes. Thank you for asking Aino-san.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>'Aino-san?'</em> Minako frowned and felt the honorific as a barb in her chest. <em>'What happened to 'Minako-chan'?'</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Setsuna  cleared her throat and dipped her head at the frowning Senshi. &quot;I  apprecitate your concern for me Aino-san. But I think I will be fine  now.&quot; <em>'What happened yesterday?'</em> she wanted to ask. <em>'What happened to me?'</em> Minako face softened as she seemed to guess what was going through her  head. Either the girl's empathatic powers were much more powerful than  Setsuna expected or she was that obivious in her confused state.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>'Or maybe there's a bond between us.'</em> The thought crept unbidden into her mind and Setsuna frowned even more. <em>'I can't have a bond with</em> <em>anyone,'</em> she thought angrily. <em>'It's my destiny to be alone.'</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But didn't Rei and Usagi beat Destiny with the mutual love they had for each other?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  sharp pain jabbed her head. Setuna placed the heel of her hand against  her forhead. Memories surfaced then, jumbled and scrambled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She  saw herself, confused, scared, whimpering in a corner. The thing that  had kept her calm was gone, a cold stone lodging itself in her chest.  All she knew was her name and the basic mechanics of human life. She  knew how to relieve her self properly, how to walk and speak, but  eveything else was blank. /<br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Setsuna sighed happily when Minako ran a brush through  her hair, stroking her scalp with long, loving strokes. When Minako had  finished, she smiled happily in the mirror at the green-haired woman.  &quot;Finished!&quot; she declared, and proud grin on her pretty face. Setsuna  turned and gave Minako a small peck on her cheek. &quot;Thank you Minako  chan.&quot; she whispered.Minako blushed as she saw Setsuna playing with the  buttons of her shirt. &quot;What are these?&quot; she asked the blonde, a  confused pout on her lips. &quot;B-Buttons.&quot; the Senshi stuttered. &quot;Oh,&quot;  Setsuna tugged on the foriegn object a few more times.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>&quot;How do I get them off?&quot;</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Minako blushed fiercely. //////</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>&quot;Open  wide!&quot; Minako said as she held up a strawberry. It seemed like  Setsuna's favorite treat and the only one Minako knew about. Setsuna  opened her mouth, curious to see what the red fruit tasted like. Minako  popped it into her mouth, but Setsuna closed her mouth too soon,  trapping the tip of the blonde's finger in her mouth as well. They both  stared at each other, Setsuna's face a mix of childish curiosity,  Minako's face a beet red.//<br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Minako came out of the bathroom, refreshed and smelling of lilacs. &quot;Okay Sets-chan, your--&quot;</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She  was cut off when the trembling woman pulled her into her arms. &quot;Don't  leave me like that,&quot; Setsuna pleaded against her neck, her voice  cracking. &quot;Please, don't do that again.&quot;</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Minako blinked  and wiggled in Setsuna's grip. &quot;I just went to take a bath Sets-chan!&quot;  The woman held her tighter, her body shaking and weak. Together, they  slumped to the floor, Minako holding Setsuna until the tremors stopped.  &quot;It's okay,&quot; she whispered and she felt hot tears scorch her neck. &quot;I'm  here Setsuna, I'm here...&quot;</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>&quot;I won't leave&quot;//</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Minako  moaned when she felt a small hand shake her. &quot;What?&quot; she asked, her  voice rough with sleep. Setsuna stood there, clad in flannel pajama  bottoms and a tank top. She held a pillow in her arms, and looked at  her with pleading red eyes. &quot;M-May I sleep with you?&quot; she asked in a  quivering voice.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Minako lifted the coverlet and allowed Setsuna to join her on the couch, cradiling the woman to her </em>heart<em> as they let sleep overtake them both</em>.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Setsuna  opened her eyes and gazed at Minako. Worried blue eyes stared back at  her. &quot;You stayed with me,&quot; she whispered. &quot;you stayed with me all that  time.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako blinked and gazed at her with liquid eyes. &quot;Oh  Setsuna,&quot; she breathed. &quot;Don't you know that I'd stay with you forever  if I had the choice?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Setsuna's bottom lip trembeled. &quot;M-Minako-chan...&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  opened her arms and embraced the Senshi of Time. &quot;I mean it...&quot; she  whispered into the green-haired woman's ear. &quot;I'll stay with you, for  as long as you want me to.&quot; she buried her face into the silken  strands. &quot;Can't you see that I love you that much?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Setsuna began  to cry against her shoulder. &quot;Minako-chan!&quot; she wailed. &quot;I want you to  stay with me.&quot; She sniffled and held back more tears. &quot;I want you. I <em>need</em> you with me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  turned and gazed at Setsuna, love shining ever so brightly. &quot;I hope you  know what you're agreeing to,&quot; she whispered as she began to lean  towards Setsuna's lips. &quot;I happen to be very clingy.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As their  lips met, Setsuna realized that there was something she was terrified  of. It wasn't that she was afraid of destroying the future. It wasn't  that she was afraid of losing her mind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Moaning on her throat,  Setsuna surrendered to the kiss, letting the unknown feelings wash over  her mind and soul, feeling her body tingle.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was afraid of forgetting Minako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">::::::::::::: Fin ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ramblings:  Ho-ly-shit. That has to be the most romantic, mushy thing I've EVER  written. I'm sorry if Setsuna was terribly OOC. Poor thing forgot her  mind, so she HAD to act a little bit different.</span></p>
