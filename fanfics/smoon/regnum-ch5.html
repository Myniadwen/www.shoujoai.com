-------------------------

[Spring/Summer 2003]

Ami sat towards the back of the local Starbucks, sipping her 
coffee slowly and pondering the sealed envelope on the table.  
Briefly she considered her newly-acquired taste (no, not a habit, 
really) for coffee.  With a giggle, she wondered how much better 
her grades might have been if she had dosed herself with this 
much caffeine to stay up later studying back in high school.

&quot;Hey Ami, are you coming to the meeting tonight?&quot; a young 
brunette asked her from over by the door where she stood with a 
couple students.  &quot;We&#39;re going to start planning our booth for 
the student activities fair.&quot;  

Ami smiled and nodded, &quot;I&#39;ll be there, Chrissy, but I have a 
paper due, so I might have to leave a little early.&quot;   

&quot;That&#39;s fine, see you tonight!&quot; Chrissy and her friends waved and 
headed out into the rain.  

&#39;I wonder what my friends would think if they saw me working a 
booth for B-GLAD,&quot; Ami mused.  Apparently her fondness (not an 
addiction, seriously) for coffee wasn&#39;t the only new thing about 
her since coming to America.  

&quot;Penny for your thoughts,&quot; a familiar voice announced.  Ami 
looked up just as her friend Elizabeth set her own coffee cup 
down next to Ami&#39;s.  &quot;May I join you?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Ami replied with a warm grin, moving her things to 
clear space at the small table.

&quot;I knew I&#39;d find you here.&quot;  Elizabeth settled down in the chair 
across from Ami, shifting her long blonde hair over one shoulder 
and out of her eyes.  She slouched down a bit so that she could 
be at eye-level with her more diminutive friend.  She briefly 
considered the tableau that the two of them must present to the 
rest of the world:  Ami, an almost stereotypical petite, 
painfully cute Asian and herself, a tall, tanned California girl.  

&quot;Were you looking for me?&quot; Ami asked.  Her eyes drifted down to 
the envelope; she could guess why Elizabeth was here.

Elizabeth&#39;s eyes followed Ami down to the table.  &quot;You haven&#39;t 
even opened it yet?  What is the hold-up?  Aren&#39;t you dying of 
curiosity?&quot;

Ami nodded and picked up the letter.  &quot;How did you know?&quot;

&quot;Hiro got his today.  He&#39;s been accepted.   I figure if he got 
his, you must have gotten yours.  If they said yes to him, how 
could they say no to you?&quot;  

&quot;I&#39;m happy for him, I know he really wanted to stay,&quot; Ami said 
quickly.  &quot;I guess, I&#39;m still not sure...&quot;

Elizabeth laid her hand gently over Ami&#39;s on the table.  &quot;Ami, I 
thought you&#39;d decided finally.&quot;  

&quot;I did.  I have.  It&#39;s just....&quot;

With a plaintive sigh and light squeeze, Elizabeth released Ami&#39;s 
hand and leaned back in her chair.  &quot;Ami, she&#39;s not even in Tokyo 
any more.&quot;  

Ami raised her gaze to meet her friends.  Though she knew she 
still didn&#39;t have the people skills that someone like Rei or 
Usagi had, she had learned a lot from her friends.  She could see 
the pain there and she could remember its source.

---

Elizabeth stepped forward, closing the space between them.   Ami 
shivered as the blonde laced her hands behind Ami&#39;s waist and 
leaned down, resting her forehead against Ami&#39;s own.  

&quot;Ami, you&#39;re not only beautiful and sweet, you&#39;re brilliant.  You 
must know how I feel about you,&quot; Elizabeth whispered.  Before she 
could tilt her head and press her lips to Ami&#39;s, the latter 
pressed her hand against them.  

&quot;Please, Elizabeth, don&#39;t.&quot;  The disappointment and pain Ami saw 
in those blue eyes broke her heart.  How ironic that she should 
be in this position.  &quot;I know how you feel about me, I do.  I 
care about you very much.  You&#39;re my best friend here and you&#39;ve 
been so wonderful to me.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Elizabeth prompted, trying vainly to stop the tears from 
building in her eyes.  &quot;There has to be a &#39;but.&#39;&quot;

Ami&#39;s fingers shifted to caress her friend&#39;s cheek.  &quot;There is, 
dear Elizabeth.  I think you&#39;re wonderful, and so very beautiful, 
but there&#39;s someone else, someone back home.  It wouldn&#39;t be fair 
to you to pretend that there wasn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;But, I thought you&#39;d never... at that meeting you said that you 
had never actually...&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t,&quot; Ami sighed regretfully, &quot;and maybe I never will, but 
someone else holds my heart in her hands.&quot;

&quot;I hope she understands what a precious thing that is,&quot; Elizabeth 
muttered.  &quot;How long will you wait, Ami?  How long will you turn 
away from what is to wait for what might never be?&quot;

&quot;I have eternity to wait,&quot; Ami whispered.  &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, 
Elizabeth.  I suppose you won&#39;t want to see me again.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous,&quot; Elizabeth responded, pulling Ami into a 
tight hug, resting her head on top of Ami&#39;s.  &quot;Hard as it might 
be to believe, I&#39;ve been shot down before, but good friends are a 
treasure you can never let go.&quot; She regretfully kissed Ami&#39;s 
hair, capturing its texture and scent in her memories forever, 
and released her friend.  Taking one of Ami&#39;s hands in her own, 
she continued their walk home.  &quot;So, the least you can do is tell 
me all about this mystery woman.&quot;

Ami beamed up at her friend with boundless relief.  It would have 
been so hard if she&#39;d lost Elizabeth from her life.  &quot;I guess I 
can do that much.  Her name is Makoto...&quot;
  
---
&quot;She&#39;s in France anyway, so what does it matter?&quot; 

Elizabeth&#39;s words shook Ami out of her reverie. &quot;I know,&quot; she 
answered quickly, &quot;and Rei is in Africa and Mina is out on tour 
most of the time.  Only Usagi and my mom are still there.&quot;   She 
took a deep breath and slid one finger in the gap where the 
envelope was sealed.  &quot;You&#39;re right, I&#39;ve made this decision.  
It&#39;s only another year or two anyway.&quot;

&quot;If you get in,&quot; Elizabeth teased, raising an eyebrow.  She 
laughed when Ami stuck out her tongue in reply.  

With a swift motion, Ami opened the envelope and pulled out the 
letter inside.   As her eyes scanned through it, a light began to 
shine in them and her smile expanded.  That was when she knew 
what she&#39;d really wanted all along.

----------

Makoto carefully cut out the last piece of the article.  It was 
getting harder to get a hold of these things, since news from San 
Francisco was not reported often in Paris.  Fortunately, one of 
the women in her classes was the wife of someone high up in the 
American Embassy.  They got all sorts of newspapers over there 
from the States and Makoto&#39;s friend always kept an eye out for 
particular articles.  

As she slid the piece of paper into her scrapbook, she grinned 
proudly.  They really loved her over there.  Any disappointment 
she&#39;d felt when she&#39;d gotten the email from Ami faded in the 
bright pride that blazed up while re-reading the article.

-Sailor Mercury Signs On For Extended Tour of Duty-

[San Francisco]  After spending the afternoon helping 
firefighters battle a five-alarm blaze at an office building 
downtown (see related story, page 1A), Sailor Mercury took some 
questions from the assembled media.  The elusive young heroine 
confirmed once again the fact that she is a native Japanese.  
When asked how long she planned to remain in the United States, 
she replied, &quot;Another year at least, now.&quot;  Needless to say, 
this news was greeted with tremendous joy by the assembled 
onlookers.  Brandie Stanton, president of the Sailor Mercury Fan 
Club, said later in response, &quot;We&#39;re all so happy...(see page 12A 
&quot;Sailor Mercury&quot;)


-------------------------------------------

&quot;Hi honey, I&#39;m home!&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m in the living room, Mamo-chan,&quot; Usagi replied.  She stood up 
from the low table and moved to greet her fiance as he entered 
the room.  &quot;How was work today, darling?&quot;

Mamoru embraced Usagi kissed her tenderly, &quot;Long, but 
interesting.  It was a slow news day, so we spent most of our 
time catching up on things, collecting fluff pieces, that sort of 
thing.&quot;

&quot;Doesn&#39;t sound too interesting to me,&quot; Usagi pointed out.  Though 
Mamoru loved his job as the news station, it always sounded very 
boring to Usagi.  Still, there were fringe benefits.  &quot;Did you 
see anything new for my scrapbook!&quot;  

&quot;As a matter of fact, Usako, I did,&quot; Mamoru chuckled.  He loved 
the way Usagi became as enthusiastic as a child at Christmas 
whenever he brought her anything.   He pulled out the San 
Francisco Examiner article and held it out for her.  &quot;It seems 
that news of Ami&#39;s stay in the US is now public knowledge.&quot;  
Mamoru thought for a moment and corrected himself, &quot;Well, of 
Sailor Mercury&#39;s extended stay, that is.&quot;

Usagi had scanned the article quickly and then dashed over to the 
table, where she placed it amongst an assortment of other papers 
scattered about.  &quot;I was just working on my scrapbook when you 
came in.  We were doing something similar in class today, so I 
got inspired.&quot;

Mamoru hung his jacket over the back of a chair and sat on the 
sofa, happily content to watch his intended sift through her 
papers.  &quot;And how was class today?  Anyone else sick?&quot;

&quot;No, little Miri is back and that cold that was sweeping through 
seems to have petered out,&quot; Usagi replied.  Having just graduated 
college, she had wanted nothing more than to settle down, but for 
some reason their wedding plans kept getting more and more 
complex.  Though a tentative date was now set, pending parental 
approval, life as a wife and mother was far enough in the future 
that Usagi had decided to get a job of her own.  Usagi and Mamoru 
both were constantly surprised at how very much she enjoyed 
teaching preschoolers, though that type of job had initially 
seemed much more up Makoto&#39;s alley than Usagi&#39;s.  Though they 
didn&#39;t speak of it much, Usagi and Mamoru knew that all too soon, 
they would find themselves in quite different positions.   Given 
that, they both resolved to enjoy as much mundane normalcy as 
they could in their lives now.  

&quot;I&#39;m glad the kids are all feeling better,&quot; Mamoru said.  &quot;You 
can go ahead and keep working on that; it&#39;s my turn to cook 
tonight.&quot;  

&quot;You think I don&#39;t know this?&quot; Usagi asked wryly.  &quot;Now get those 
shoes off, get that apron and cook me a meal, Mamo-chan!&quot;   She 
laughed when he simply stared at her in mock irritation.   
Suddenly, she leapt to her feet and threw her arms around him.  
&quot;I love you so much, Mamo-chan!  You&#39;re so cute when you pretend 
to pout.&quot;

Mamoru laughed and scooped his love off of her feet, relishing 
her happy squeal as he swung her in a short circle.  &quot;I love you, 
too, Usako.  After dinner, you can show me the progress you&#39;ve 
made.&quot;  He kissed her then, perhaps a bit more passionately than 
he&#39;d originally intended.

As he set her down, she giggled happily, as she always did when 
she realized the effect she had on him.  &quot;Enough of that, you.  
I&#39;m hungry and I want my dinner.&quot;  She gave him a peck on the 
cheek and gently shoved him towards the kitchen.   Once he was 
safely away, she settled back down by the table, sorting through 
her articles.  Truly, it had been much too long since she&#39;d 
gotten around to updating her scrapbook.

&#39;I think this one next,&#39; she thought as she lifted a glossy 
magazine article.  

---------
--UN agencies and generic pharmaceutical companies step up 
collaboration to expand access to essential medicines--

The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF recognize that the 
generic pharmaceutical industry has a vital role to play in 
efforts to provide safe and effective medicines at low cost to 
improve health and save lives.

At meetings this week, WHO?s Director-General, Gro Harlem 
Brundtland welcomed the commitment made by the International 
Generic Pharmaceutical Alliance (IGPA) and generic manufacturers 
of antiretrovirals (ARVs) to work in close collaboration with UN 
agencies to achieve increased access to safe and effective 
medicines of assured quality.

Director-General Brundtland announced that WHO staffer Hino Rei 
would head up a new office designed to foster this collaboration 
and to ensure the distribution of low cost pharmaceuticals to 
impoverished peoples across the world.  Ms. Hino made a statement 
to the press.  &quot;The UN family is fully committed to working with 
the international generic industry as well as brand name 
companies to scale up access to HIV/AIDS care.  There are 
millions of people at risk from this deadly disease, many of them 
children.  My office will work to ensure that these people 
receive the care and medicines they require to live healthy, 
productive lives.&quot;

---------

Rei leaned forward, pulling her hair together and binding it up 
with a red ribbon.   She could imagine what it looked like in 
this heat and humidity, but hopefully in a long ponytail, it 
would be fine.  Her neck certainly felt cooler.   She stood 
beside a white-walled building watching trucks drive past into 
the compound.  A clerk stood next to her, tallying each arrival 
on a clipboard.  

&quot;That&#39;s just about all of them, Ms. Hino,&quot; the clerk informed as 
the last truck arrived.  

&quot;What do you mean &#39;just about&#39;?&quot; Rei asked.  The trucks were all 
traveling together in a caravan from the port, carrying much 
needed medical supplies for the people in the interior.  Rei had 
spent the better part of the last few months negotiating with the 
CEOs of the world&#39;s largest drug companies, trying to convince 
them to donate these supplies or at least to sell them at a price 
even the UN could afford.  &quot;Come on,&quot; she said to her aide as she 
set off to track down the last driver.

&quot;Yeah, they got a flat tire,&quot; the driver informed her after Rei 
had inquired about the fate of the last truck.  &quot;We offered to 
hold up the caravan, but they insisted we go on ahead.&quot;   Biting 
off any number of curses that sprang to mind, Rei thanked the 
driver.   

&quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be here soon,&quot; the clerk suggested.  Rei 
paused, however, and focused herself.  Sometimes, she really 
missed the quiet serenity of her old temple and of the sacred 
flame.   As she cleared her mind, she sensed it.  Something was 
wrong.  &quot;I need a car,&quot; she announced to the startled clerk.  

&quot;But, Ms. Hino...&quot; the clerk stammered.

&quot;No &#39;buts&#39;!  I need a car.  Now!&quot;   Without waiting for a reply, 
Rei dashed off to the motor pool.   Her aide could fill out the 
paperwork later.  She was good at that.  Rei, on the other hand, 
had little patience for such things.   Even as the young woman 
ran up, waving her clipboard frantically, Rei sped off in the 
opposite direction. 

She found the missing truck rather soon.  Unfortunately, they had 
encountered more trouble than just a flat tire.  As Rei peered 
over a rise at the scene before her, she could make out the 
drivers of the truck, bound and gagged by the side of the road.  
A group of young men in combat fatigues, with rifles in hand, 
were just releasing the truck from the jack and getting ready to 
climb aboard.  

&quot;Come on, those peacekeepers could be back here any minute.&quot;

&quot;And if they do, we&#39;ll show them who really rules this part of 
the world.  Hey, who&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;Stop right there!  The peacekeepers you refer to risk their 
lives to protect the innocent and bring peace and security to 
people all over the world.  That truck has medicine that will 
save the lives of women and children in this country.  I will not 
allow crooked thieves like to you to steal it.  I am Sailor Mars, 
and in the name of Mars, I will punish you.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s some girl in high heels!  Go grab her and we can have a 
little fun back at camp.  Holy crap!  What&#39;s she doing???&quot;

-------------------

&quot;So, did you hear about what happened with Rei?&quot; Minako asked, 
settling back into the comfy, yet stylish, sofa that Mamoru and 
Usagi had just bought.  It was hard to move with so much food 
sitting in her tummy.  She had never known that Usagi was such a 
good cook.   True, the kitchen looked like a tsunami had passed 
through, but the food had been wonderful.  It was so nice to have 
a home-cooked meal after so much junk eaten on the road. 

Usagi sat across from Minako, not concerned in the least about 
the immense amount of clean-up work she had left for Mamoru.  It 
was his turn to clean, after all.  &quot;No, what happened?&quot;

Minako smiled happily.  Apparently, Rei hadn&#39;t told anyone else 
and that made her feel special.  &quot;Well, she told me about in a 
letter, but then I tracked this down off of a wire service.&quot;  
Minako blushed, &quot;Well, some of my people tracked it down for me, 
but I asked them to!&quot;  Mina pulled out a well-worn piece of paper 
out of her purse.

Usagi took it and read, careful not to rip it.  Looking up, she 
exclaimed, &quot;Sailor Mars saved a shipment of medical supplies?!  
And Rei didn&#39;t even mention it in her last letter!&quot;  

&quot;I think she was kind of embarrassed. She&#39;s been so focused on 
her work with the WHO.  I think she almost felt like she was 
cheating using her Sailor powers to help,&quot; Minako explained.

&quot;But she told you,&quot; Usagi pointed out in a teasing tone, tainted 
with a hint of jealousy. 

Minako broke out in a sweat and turned her gaze away from Usagi&#39;s 
with a happy blush.  Trying to change the subject, she asked, 
&quot;Have you heard anything from Makoto lately?&quot;

--------------------------

&quot;May I have a word with you, Kino-san?&quot;

The sound of Japanese being spoken startled Makoto.  Looking up 
from the bowls and ingredients laid out before her, she saw an 
older Asian man in a nice black suit waiting patiently.

&quot;Are you allowed to be back here?&quot; she asked, wiping flour off of 
her hands onto her apron.  

&quot;Monsieur LaHaye gave me his personal permission to speak with 
you now, Kino-san,&quot; the Japanese man informed her.  &quot;My name is 
Watanabe and I represent a very large hotel chain.&quot;

&quot;Pleased to meet you, Watanabe-san,&quot; Makoto replied, still 
puzzled as to why Master LaHaye would allow someone into his 
kitchen. 

&quot;Please, Monsieur LaHaye said that we may speak in his office,&quot; 
Watanabe explained.  With a gesture indicating she should follow, 
he headed toward the back of the kitchen and into a small office.  
As he sat behind the desk, he gestured to Makoto to take a seat 
as well.

&quot;Kino-san, our corporation has been seeking a new master chef for 
some time now.  We have recently purchased a series of upscale 
hotels throughout Europe and we need someone to oversee the 
restaurants in those hotels.&quot;

Makoto simply stared at the man.  &#39;He must need a 
recommendation,&#39; she decided finally.   She frantically began to 
search her head for names of those who might be qualified for 
such an important position.

&quot;The president of the company prefers that positions of such 
importance be filled with people who understand our homeland, 
preferably native Japanese.  However, we also require someone 
familiar with Europe and European cuisine.   Additionally, it is 
our preference to hire younger individuals, people with great 
potential who are willing to work hard to achieve that potential, 
rather than to bring on established names.  We find that people 
at the beginning of their careers are more productive than those 
at the end.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t be suggesting...&quot; Makoto began, shaking her head in 
disbelief.

&quot;Yes, Kino-san, we are suggesting.  Please understand that I have 
performed extensive research, interviewed master chefs and the 
faculty of the finest culinary academies in both Tokyo and Paris.  
Throughout my search, I have heard one name over and over again.  
Monsieur LaHaye confirmed it this evening when he said that you 
were the finest sous chef he has seen in years and that your 
potential was limitless.&quot;  

Makoto fell back into her chair, not even realizing till that 
point that she had been sitting on the edge of it.  This had to 
be some sort of joke.  Even as she struggled to guess who could 
be so cruel, Watanabe reached into his briefcase and pulled out 
some folders.  

&quot;This is information about our corporation, including a formal 
offer letter and an explanation of our benefits package.  You 
will also find information about the restaurants and hotels in 
question.  While your work will keep you in Europe for the next 
few years, you should know that if you do as well as we expect it 
is likely that we will recall you to Japan after that.  The 
individual who occupies the same position for our Japanese hotels 
is due to retire in the near future.  I&#39;m sure this is a lot for 
you to process, and I know you have work to do this evening.  
Please look over what I&#39;ve given you and consider our offer.  My 
card is in that red folder.  I will await your reply.&quot;

---------------------- 

&#39;Oh Mako-chan, I knew you could do it,&#39; Ami sighed as she pressed 
the article into place.  She placed the remnants of the Food 
section of the Examiner to one side and picked up the Travel 
section.  Not for the first time, she found herself seeking out 
air fares for flights to Europe instead of Japan.
