<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Someone to Believe In<br />
</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Coffee?” The question hung in the air awkwardly as Minako carried their coats to the closet.</span></p>
</span><p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tea?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.”  The reply was distracted as Rei’s dark eyes surveyed the singer’s  apartment – much like the hotel room the miko had seen in a vision, the  apartment was sparsely decorated and looked largely unlived in. But  then, she guessed that being an international star, ‘home’ must be hard  to define.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Water?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei glanced at her best friend firmly.  “No, Minako. I’m fine.” The curt response carried dual meanings and Rei  was relieved to see Minako relax slightly, but then, the shoe was put  on the other foot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The singer crossed the space between them and  led Rei to where two oversized easy chairs sat catty corner to each  other against sliding glass doors that led to a dark balcony. Rei sat  stiffly, her hands in her lap, her legs pressed tightly together as  Minako took the seat opposite her, their knees just barely touching.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  want to know what you remember… about the past.” In her simple  statement, Minako couldn’t keep the hopefulness from her wavering voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  inhaled slowly. Suddenly, her hands became terribly interesting, “I  remember the Silver Millennium. I remember the planetary alliance, the  moon kingdom, our planets. I remember our princess, our queen, Mercury,  and Jupiter. I remember Venus Minako and Mars Reiko.” She hesitated. “I  remember… I remember <em>us</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko had always possessed a  talent for being hard to read, but Rei’s firm jaw and hard eyes sent  the singer the wrong message.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And are the memories that terrible?” Minako choked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s  pained voice had made Rei’s stomach twist, but also gave her the  confidence she needed to push forward, to quell Minako’s fears, for  though it was her seriousness that had scared Minako, it was Minako she  was serious <em>about</em>.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, the memories aren’t terrible at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer’s head shot up and imploring eyes sought Rei’s hopefully. It was  just like her best friend; normally vague and avoidant, she could be  also blunt and confident when she knew what she wanted.<em> ‘So what does she want?’</em> Minako asked herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve  come to understand and accept Reiko’s memories, but I’m still learning  what they mean in relation to my own feelings.” Rei explained.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Examining  Minako’s confused expression, Rei understood she’d have to spell things  out for the singer. She collected herself; it was all or nothing now.  “Minako, I didn’t need Mars Reiko’s memories to become attracted to  you. <em>That</em> happened long ago, though I didn’t know what to do  about it then, and quite frankly, I don’t know what to do about it now,  either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That age old hope blossomed within Minako’s chest, but  knowing the lines of communication would flow more freely between them  in a comfortable argument, she latched onto Rei’s aggressiveness,  shooting back with a confession of her own, “And you think I feel any  less for you? I may have never verbalized it, but my feelings for you  should be obvious, both back then, and now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei took the bait  and shot up from her seat. She errantly tucked a stray lock of dark  hair behind an ear as she began to pace to the living room, wearing a  track through the crisply vacuumed carpet. “Well, I don’t know where  you stand on the division between yourself and Venus Minako, but  knowing how blindly you were tied to your past five years ago, I should  hope you aren’t simply following your past memories and emotions  instead of your own.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako also rose, her body tense, her eyes following her best friend’s movements nervously. “I do believe it was <em>you</em> who taught me how to live as Aino Minako, Rei. I’d think that after  that lesson, I’d know that my feelings for you were my own and <em>not</em> merely a reflection of Venus Minako’s feelings.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">All  movement ground to a halt. The miko and the singer held a level stare  with each other from across the room, and in Minako’s serious gaze, Rei  found the truth she’d hoped to find in the other woman’s honest words.  And it was then that her mind took her back to a time, five years ago,  when, standing on a stage in front of a modest crowd, she had sung a  song from her heart, a song that had been made for her;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>God doesn’t exist, but I want to believe in someone.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And as Rei examined the hopeful look of her best friend, the once jaded miko thought, <em>‘Perhaps… I have found someone to believe in. Perhaps I can believe in </em>Minako<em>.’ </em>But when the idol’s melodious laughter broke their silence, Rei felt her hackles rise.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s so funny?” The miko barked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I get the feeling that neither one of us wants to believe the other.” Minako said with an air of defeat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s fists clenched. “Well, with how devoted you were to the past-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  admit, I was obsessed with the past,” Minako’s seriousness returned  with a vengeance, but now her features softened as slightly as her  voice, “but… knowing you won’t <em>have</em> a future will do that to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer eyed Rei, who looked very much like a child scolded for having  forced such an explanation from her, and a small smile touched the  idol’s lips. Only a handful of paces brought her in front of her best  friend, and allowing the miko barely an inch of personal space between  them, she reached up, her soft fingers gently brushing Rei’s long bangs  back away from her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How’s this for proof,” Minako offered,  even as she quelled the shakiness in her hands and in her voice, “I’ll  have you know that Aino Minako fell for Hino Rei before she even <em>knew</em> she was Sailor Mars.” The singer smirked at the look of shock that  sparkled in Rei’s eyes, at that adorable little ’o’ left by Rei’s  trembling lips. “Yes, that day at the church.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The tables were  being turned and the singer knew she was gaining the upper hand by  proving herself in an undisputable way. “So there.” She added  petulantly, raising her eyebrow when Rei snorted. She stepped away  slightly, and was pleased to note that Rei forged forward, as though  she yearned to reclaim the space that had grown between them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Besides, how am I supposed to believe <em>you</em> when you claimed so vehemently back then that the past meant nothing to  you?” The accusatory question, purposely designed to goad Rei on, was  tossed over Minako’s shoulder casually.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei winced but puffed  herself up. “I may not have had my memories of the past life at the  time, but that didn’t mean that I didn’t feel for you. If you knew  anything about me, you’d have known that I was fighting for the future  back then! I’ve spent the majority of my life being raised on the  values of Shinto dogma, I was taught to work hard for the present and  find happiness within this life, not the past that we couldn’t change. <em>That’s</em> why I wanted you to try the surgery. I didn’t want to lose you in <em>this</em> life!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  intensity left by the miko’s unusual outburst resulted in a stressed  silence that hung heavily in the room. Minako surrendered first. She  broke eye contact to look away shyly; her proud stance deflated, and  she collapsed onto the couch, defeated. “I… I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A sigh  accompanied the miko as she too gave in, also seeking solace in the  couch, sitting shoulder to shoulder with her best friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Everything  had been laid on the line, from feelings that had been born five years  ago to clearing up reasons behind their actions that had remained  unspoken for all that time. It was an abridged version, but it was  obvious that they both knew they had nearly reached their limit, and by  a mutual agreement, they had retreated. Much had been left unsaid, but  it was too much to tackle at one time. Maybe even several times.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This time, Rei noticed Minako’s quiet laugh carried an ironic lilt to it. “Now what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer looked at her hands where she idly steepled them together. “I’m  just thinking of what an idiot I was.” She said softly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko couldn’t help but share the sentiment with a snort of her own. “I don’t think I was any better, really.” She admitted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  time, the silence that fell between them was a comfortable one. And  when Minako leaned her head on Rei’s shoulder, the dark eyed woman  couldn’t help but smile warmly, finally relieved to have gotten it all  out to the one and only person who mattered, and to have finally  understood, in no uncertain terms, that they really had felt the same  for each other. That they <em>still</em> felt the same for each other.  But there were still questions, a nagging foreboding that lingered, and  Rei tensed when she remembered the cold eyes of the Sailor Mars of her  vision.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako raised her head in question, “What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  frowned thoughtfully. “I just want to know; why now, five years after  the fact, am I remembering what our past personas shared?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maybe…”  the singer looked at her best friend for a few moments, composing the  right words, “maybe there was something about your past, beyond our  relationship, that you weren’t ready to deal with back then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The gears in the miko’s head continued to turn and she nodded slightly. “There <em>is</em> one memory that evades me, one memory that leaves me uneasy that I can never pin down, no matter how hard I try.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  nodded, remembering when she’d found Rei in the fireroom earlier that  morning, and she could only guess that whatever vision had disturbed  her so greatly then, had been the memory she spoke of. And though she  had her suspicion of what that memory might be, she shied away from the  mere thought of it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Besides,” Minako added quickly, steering the  direction of their conversation to marginally safer territory, “maybe  we weren’t ready to try for a relationship back then, regardless of how  we may have felt for each other. We were young then, Rei. We were going  different places in our lives, we had different goals. We were too  immature, too stubborn to talk… about how we felt. Even if something  between us <em>could</em> have happened, it probably wouldn’t have worked out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What? Are you proposing we try for a relationship <em>now</em>,  Aino Minako?” Despite Rei’s attempt at casual indifference, her voice  had betrayed her hopefulness. She could feel the color rising to her  cheeks and she fidgeted nervously under Minako’s unreadable gaze.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  Minako’s hand rested reassuringly on Rei’s own, the miko once again  looked at her. For all the assertiveness Rei had displayed, now that  the initial rush of raw emotions had worn off, Minako knew not to push  her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The singer smiled warmly and squeezed her best friend’s  hand, “I’m not suggesting anything other than that you take your time  and figure out what you want, Rei. But know this; I’ve felt this way  for you for a long time, and I can keep on waiting, if that’s what you  need.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At a loss for words, Rei could only nod thankfully and  match Minako’s strength. Turning her palm upwards, she squeezed the  singer’s hand back and laced their fingers together.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was a  clock that eventually disrupted them; it’s not so subtle chime  reminding the women that it was midnight. The miko moaned her  displeasure. “It’s going to be a rough morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It doesn’t have  to be,” Minako responded with a slight smirk. When Rei frowned at her,  she continued playfully, “you could just stay the night here you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  opened her mouth to protest, but then realized she didn’t really want  to. However, still having an image to uphold, she looked away  haughtily, stole her hand from Minako’s own, and crossed her arms over  her chest. “I don’t know. I’ll have to get up pretty early. As a miko,  I <em>do</em> have responsibilities to the shrine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Playing along,  Minako snorted and stuck her nose in the air. “Well then, I’ll just  call my driver to bring you back to the shrine. I certainly don’t want  the world’s best miko to disrupt her duties.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two women  chuckled, looked at each other, and broke into a sudden fit of  laughter. Finally, Rei acquiesced. “I’ll stay.” She said, her lilting  voice laced with laughter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako smirked at her best friend. “Okay. I’ll be sure not to defile the shrine maiden <em>tonight</em> then.” She said offhandedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko had the decency to feign offence at the singer’s jest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">O    O    O</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  few hours, a few ‘what if’s’, and entirely too many ‘do you remember  when’s’ later, Minako and Rei were huddled next to each other at the  kitchen table. Fatigue was written across both their faces; the miko’s  eyes kept shutting on themselves and the singer’s chin continually  slipped off her palm. A pot of tea that had long gone cold sat between  them. Their voices and their brains too tired to continue, the two  women finally settled into silence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shall we go to… bed?”  Minako’s suggestion hung in the air awkwardly. She was pleased to note  Rei nod her affirmation, perhaps too tired at this point to argue or  even to be shy. It had been a long day for both of them, after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  one couldn’t sleep in outerwear, a change of costume had been  previously arranged, and donning matching grey sweats - obviously made  for Minako, as Rei seemed almost to be waiting for the next tide in  hers - the two women padded back to the main bedroom in single file  order.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The apartment was large, Minako had explained, but the  only room besides the living area and the kitchen she’d bothered  furnishing was the master bedroom, and so the two women found  themselves sitting on opposite sides of the lavishly decorated king  sized bed, distinctly avoiding each other’s drooping gazes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>It isn’t like we haven’t been to Usagi’s slumber parties. We’ve even shared the same futon before!’ </em>Minako  chided herself, unable to forget those few sleepless nights laying next  to what had then been her unrequited crush. Forcing the butterflies in  her stomach to slow the rapid beating of their wings, she lifted the  covers and slid between the sheets.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei quickly followed suit. A  far cry from her accustomed futon atop a wooden floor, and smelling  wonderfully of the jasmine scent she’d come to associate with Minako,  the miko turned her body towards the warmth of her best friend and  surrendered herself to the bed’s comforts without even putting up a  fight.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ne, Rei?” Minako asked quietly after a moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer rolled on her side, the miko’s name dying on her tongue as she  found the woman in question already fast asleep. Minako smiled gently  and snaked one hand outside the covers to brush Rei’s long bangs away  from her forehead. Leaning over ever so slightly, she laid the smallest  of kisses on Rei’s forehead.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then, she turned out the light,  pulled the covers up to her chin, wrapped one arm lightly around Rei’s  waist, and immediately fell asleep.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">O    O    O</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Backed  up against the wall, her forehead resting against the slightly taller  woman’s shoulder, Minako’s dark hair formed a curtain around her face.  Her breath came in labored pants as her thighs clenched the familiar  hand between her legs. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Harder,” Minako pleaded, her voice a hoarse whisper.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  dark eyed woman smiled and eagerly complied, and when her best friend’s  head tipped back, lolling against the wall, her lips and teeth found  the tender skin of Minako’s neck.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Rei-“ Minako’s hot  voice was a puff of breath in her lover’s ear as she crested the wave  of her climax, her body tensing, depending on the other woman’s  strength for stability as the long haired woman finished giving Minako  her greatest gift…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei woke with a gasp, her heart pounding  loudly in her ears. The strange ceiling, the foreign surroundings, and  the pressure that seemed to be holding her body down to an all too soft  surface spiraled around in her confused head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She caught herself  right before she jumped out the bed and assaulted her would be  attacker, for when she was met with Minako’s sleeping face, the other  woman’s head buried against her shoulder and the reassuring warmth of  her arm around her waist, Rei’s anxiety vanished in a heart beat and  she breathed a quiet sigh of relief. However, the rush of adrenaline  having passed, this left Rei all too aware of the arousal she’d felt  after the disturbingly vivid dream she’d had.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Was it a dream?’ </em>She asked herself,<em> ‘A vision of the past? Or was it …a premonition of the future?’ </em>The miko blushed hotly at where her thoughts had taken her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rather  unwillingly, Rei glanced at the clock that lay on the bedside table and  cursed. She’d suspected she was already late, but she hadn’t  anticipated that she’d wasted half the morning asleep next to Minako.  Although she knew that her absence at the shrine would raise questions,  she couldn’t help but admit that she’d rather spend the entire day in  bed with the woman.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Not like that!’</em> The blush returned to Rei’s face full force as she tried to convince herself of her innocent intentions, <em>‘Just… being with her. First.’</em> She added the last part shyly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  miko smiled at her best friend, and allowing herself a few more  moments, she marveled at the beautiful innocence she saw in Minako’s  relaxed features. She couldn’t help herself from brushing the singer’s  slightly curled bangs away from her face in order to lay a gentle kiss  on her forehead before she stealthily slid out from underneath Minako’s  light embrace.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">O    O    O</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako had the decency to wait  through the sounds of Rei fumbling around in the hall bathroom,  assumingly changing back into her clothes from the night before, and  then waiting for the sound of the front door to click shut before she  cracked an eye open lazily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Though she mourned the empty spot  beside her, she knew it wouldn’t be long before she’d see Rei again. In  fact, seeing as how Usagi and the girls had already planned a party  that very night to celebrate the success of Minako’s encore finale  concert, it would be only half a day before she and Rei were together  again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">An easy smile spread across Minako’s face as she sighed and stretched out across the space where her best friend had slept. <em>‘Maybe I won’t even wait </em>that<em> long.’ </em>She considered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Pulling  the miko’s pillow close to her body, she indulged in the lavender  tinged essence of her best friend. A half a heartbeat later, Minako had  fallen back asleep, and in her dreams, Rei’s lips were on her skin once  more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">O    O    O</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s Notes:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally, ne? . But…  it’s not over yet. There are another six chapters to Rei and Minako’s  story, and its not all sunshine, lollipops and rainbows. So, was it  realistic? Plausible? Worth the wait to get them together? </span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Preview, Chapter 9:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Three  heads turned when the door to their secret meeting room opened to  produce not just one of their two late friends, but both at the same  time. Completely entranced with each other, Rei and Minako could have  been in their own world; standing practically on top of each other, it  was a wonder they didn’t tumble down the steps in a tangle of limbs.  Three blank expressions slipped into furrowed brows and open mouths as  Aino Minako, clinging tightly to Hino Rei’s elbow, slung a comeback to  a previously unheard barb,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well if you weren’t such a <em>hentai</em>, maybe we would have gotten here sooner.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Bristling, Rei snapped her head back to glare up at Minako. “Would you <em>stop</em> taking that out of context? I told you, you got that all wrong!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi  set her soda down with a clatter, Makoto stuck the end of her pen in  her mouth in wonder, and the slightest of blushes warmed Ami’s cheeks.  The three women examined their other two friends as though they were  complete strangers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It would be the beginning of an interesting night.</span></p>
