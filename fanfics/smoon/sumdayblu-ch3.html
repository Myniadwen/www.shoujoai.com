<h1>Someday Out of the Blue (part 3 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/immeblue.html">Immeblue</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/sumdayblu-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Makoto slammed the door to her room. &quot;I can&#39;t let her think I&#39;m an 
idiot.&quot; She stalked over to the phone and rang the front desk. 
&quot;Connect me to Mizuno Ami&#39;s room please.&quot; Makoto paused as she realize 
there might not have a Mizuno Ami at this hotel, there was a chance 
Ami was married. The thought somehow brought an unnoticed frown to 
Makoto&#39;s face. 

Makoto was so enthralled with her thoughts she didn&#39;t hear the 
operator say she was being connected, and was a bit nervous as she 
listened to the ringing phone.

&quot;Hello?&quot;

Makoto froze, &#145;why the hell don&#39;t I think these things through? What 
am I supposed to say to her?&#39; 

&quot;Hello, is anyone there?&quot;

&#145;Wait! That doesn&#39;t sound like Ami.&#39; &quot;May I speak to Ms. Mizuno 
please.&quot;

&quot;Just a moment.&quot; &#145;She sounds a lot like that damned nanny from the 
pool&#39; Makoto huffed at the memory of the unpleasant woman and the poor 
child who had to suffer through her. 

&quot;Dr. Mizuno here,&quot; Makoto snapped to attention on hearing Ami&#39;s 
business voice. Makoto knew it all to well; the voice that showed 
strength, yet compassion, leadership, yet friendship, she&#39;d had to use 
it with her own subordinates. She sighed as she reasoned everyone had 
to learn it. 

&quot;Is anyone there?&quot;

&#145;Shit.&#39; Makoto chided herself &#145;this just makes me look like more of an 
ass.&#39;

&quot;Ami its me,&quot; she crooned jovially hoping that things would go 
smoothly as they established a dialogue. 

There was silence at the other end, bringing Makoto&#39;s mind to the 
gravity of what she&#39;s doing. &#145;Damnit!! I&#39;m probably the last person 
she wants to see...&quot; Again her mind was drifting to that horrible 
night, but was halted by Ami&#39;s voice.

&quot;Makoto? Is it you?&quot; Makoto noticed the loss of the business tone and 
smiled.

&quot;The one and only.&quot; perplexed by Ami&#39;s laugh Makoto asked her about 
it.

&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot;

&quot;Nothing.&quot; Ami sobered &quot;but you would think so wouldn&#39;t you.&quot;

&quot;No Ami I know so,&quot; Makoto smiled. &#145;This is going well.&#39; &quot;I know I&#39;m 
the only me on this planet.&quot; Laying flat on the bed with one knee up 
to get comfortable she continued, &quot;as for being the only Makoto then 
there I have to give in, I actually saw one at the pool today.&quot;

&quot;You did?&quot; 

Makoto could hear Ami was intrigued so she went on, &quot;yeah cute little 
mutchkin, probably around 5, though she had the most insolent nanny I 
have ever seen....&quot;

&quot;What makes you say that?&quot; 

Makoto assumed Ami&#39;s eagerness to know was polite encouragement and 
went on, &quot;It looked like the kid couldn&#39;t understand Japanese very 
well and the nanny would shove her around and even called her a 
halfbreed loud enough for everyone to hear. She insulted the mother 
too for not teaching the kid some Japanese before bringing.....&quot; 

&quot;Makoto&quot; Ami&#39;s voice was tight as she cut Makoto off. &quot;Are you sure 
about this?&quot;

Makoto snorted &quot;of course I&#39;m sure I was there, I wanted to rip her 
head off myself.&quot; Makoto could tell that this conversation was 
obviously making Ami upset, and decided that now was a good time to 
get around to why she called. Though Ami was ahead of her.

&quot;Is there something you wanted Mako?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, for us to see each other again.&quot;

Ami was quiet and Makoto realized her error, &#145;oh man! Don&#39;t use those 
words.&#39;

&quot;I mean I&#39;d like us to catch up, its been eighteen years, don&#39;t you 
want to she how I&#39;ve changed.&quot; &#145;And that I&#39;m not a blushing idiot.&#39;

&quot;Ok, I&#39;d like us to get reacquainted again too...&quot;

&quot;Wonderful! Dinner tonight?&quot;

&quot;No, sorry I have plans to have dinner with someone else. I&#39;ll leave a 
message for you to let you know when I&#39;m free, excuse me Makoto I have 
to go. Bye&quot;

Makoto laid stunned, listening to the dial tone. &quot;Um..right!&quot; she said 
as she slowly hung up &quot;what just happened?&quot;
