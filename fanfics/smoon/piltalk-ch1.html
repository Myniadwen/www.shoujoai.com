<h1>Pillow Talk</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>There was a gentle silence in the girl&#39;s bedroom that
had once been filled with soft cries and gasps. The
two young women lay on the bed in a tangle of sweaty
limbs, the taller, black haired girl and her smaller
blonde lover. The sheets were a mess, pushed aside
roughly, while nearby on the floor two school uniforms
had been tossed hastily aside.

&#147;Thank you,&#148; the beautiful blonde finally sighed out
happily, curling up at the black haired woman&#146;s side.
They lay there together for a time, both of them
catching their breaths. &#147;Rei,&#148; she finally said
softly, &#147;could I ask you something?&#148;

Rei Hino smiled a bit drowsily, reaching down to
stroke that blonde hair away from her lover&#146;s
beautiful face. &#147;It was my pleasure,&#148; she said before
adding quietly, &#147;and you know that you can ask me
about anything, Minako.&#148;

Minako Aino chuckled softly, looking up at Rei with a
wicked smile that would do one of their enemies proud.
&#147;Oh really?&#148; she purred dangerously.

&#147;You can be such a hentai,&#148; Rei&#146;s cheeks went bright
red but she had a pleased smile.

&#147;You left yourself wide open for that one, love,&#148;
Minako smirked back.

&#147;I guess so,&#148; a smiling Rei agreed, gently hugging
Minako closer to her body. Her Grandfather was going
to be gone for the day, thankfully, or else they
wouldn&#146;t be doing this. Or at the very least, they&#146;d
be much quieter about it.

&#147;I was wondering,&#148; Minako looked up at Rei with an
expression of gentle caring on her face, &#147;did you
decide to go out with me because you couldn&#146;t have
Usagi?&#148;

&#147;What?&#148; Rei blurted out.

Minako chuckled softly. &#147;I&#146;m the senshi of Love,&#148; she
reminded her gently, &#147;I knew that you cared about her,
loved her deeply.&#148;

Rei shook her head with a soft sigh, &#147;Minako, I can&#146;t
believe you&#146;d say something like that.&#148; She slipped
her hand under Minako&#146;s chin, gazing into those blue
eyes as she said intensely, &#147;I love you, no matter how
crazy you may make me.&#148;

Minako blinked away a few happy tears, leaning forward
to press her lips to Rei&#146;s. &#147;You&#146;re right,&#148; she
purred, &#147;and you also love Usagi.&#148; Before Rei could
protest she added, &#147;So do I. And Makoto, Haruka,
Michiru, Setsuna and probably Ami.&#148;

&#147;Assuming that she even has a sex drive under that
bookish exterior,&#148; Rei conceded that point softly,
then she was startled by Minako&#39;s laugh. &quot;What?&quot; she
asked.

&#147;Ami might surprise you,&#148; Minako chuckled.

Rei looked down at her in honest surprise. &#147;You mean
that you and Ami... you two actually...?&#148; she trailed
off.

&#147;Once, yeah,&#148; Minako agreed. She laughed softly, &#147;I
wonder what sort of books Ami reads when we&#146;re not
around?&#148;

&#147;Why?&#148; Rei asked with a blush.

&#147;For a virgin,&#148; Minako said with a wicked smirk, &#147;Ami
certainly knew her way around a woman&#146;s body.&#148;

&#147;Somehow I have a hard time putting Ami and sex
together in my imagination,&#148; Rei said with a sigh, a
faint blush to her cheeks.

&#147;Hopefully Makoto doesn&#146;t have that problem,&#148; Minako
cuddled.

Rei raised an eyebrow, &quot;Are they...?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know for sure,&quot; Minako pouted, &quot;but both of
them are interested.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t get started with matchmaking again,&quot; Rei
cautioned her, &quot;I think both Makoto and Ami would just
die of embarrassment if you meddled.&quot;

&quot;I guess you&#39;re right,&quot; Minako admitted. She perked up
a bit as she said, &quot;Did you see those rings that
Haruka, Michiru and Setsuna are wearing?&quot;

&quot;They got the matching rings to symbolize their
partnership in raising Hotaru together,&quot; Rei reminded
her of that fact firmly.

&quot;Really?&quot; Minako smiled slightly, &quot;I wonder...&quot;

The golden ring glinted on a slim finger, resting on a
bare shoulder as she took a few moments to try and
catch her breath. &quot;Poor Haruka,&quot; the green haired
woman smiled over at her as she softly purred, &quot;you&#39;re
all tired out.&quot;

Haruka smiled back, her sandy hair falling down into
her eyes. &quot;Come on, Michiru,&quot; she said, placing a hand
adorned with a matching ring atop hers, &quot;I am a bit
outnumbered.&quot;

The third figure on the bed smiled over at the two of
them, her long mane of greenish black hair flowing
around her shoulders as she added a third ring to the
pile. Setsuna smirked at Haruka, &quot;If you like, Michiru
and I could...&quot;

Haruka just laughed gently at that suggestion. &quot;If you
two ever decide to,&quot; she sounded entirely comfortable
with the idea, &quot;could I watch?&quot;

&quot;Hentai,&quot; Michiru scolded with a smile.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t the one that brought it up,&quot; Haruka simply
chuckled, laying back with her hands tucked behind her
head.

&quot;We&#39;re not going to win this one,&quot; Setsuna laughed.
She stretched out as well on one side of Haruka,
Michiru taking the other side as they relaxed, basking
in the afterglow.

&quot;I wonder if Hotaru is having as much fun as we are
with Chibi-Usa over at Usagi&#39;s?&quot; Haruka mused with a
little smile.

&quot;I rather doubt it,&quot; Michiru murmured.

&quot;I suppose Hotaru and Chibi-Usa are a little young, at
that,&quot; Setsuna scolded softly.

Michiru reached out to grab her nightie from the
floor, sitting up then pulling the light green garment
over her head and down her slim body. She felt the
warm gazes of her two lovers and took her time,
letting the thin material settle around her body. As
they all settled down on the bed Michiru noted the
thoughtful look on Setsuna&#39;s face, &quot;What?&quot;

Setsuna&#39;s cheeks were touched with a faint blush. &quot;How
did you two...&quot; she hesitated, &quot;When did you decide
to...&quot; her cheeks reddened more.

&quot;When did we decide to try and seduce you?&quot; Haruka
offered cheerfully when Setsuna trailed off
uncomfortably.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t have put it that way,&quot; Setsuna&#39;s face was
bright red, &quot;but yes.&quot;

Michiru smiled over at Setsuna fondly. &quot;For me, it was
shortly after we all moved in here together to help
raise Hotaru,&quot;she explained, &quot;before then I knew that
I liked you, but I wasn&#39;t really attracted to you, if
you know what I mean.&quot;

&quot;I have to admit to a bit of attraction even before we
all moved in,&quot; Haruka said with a sly smile, &quot;but
that... deepened as we got to know you more.&quot;

&quot;And I began to notice you two,&quot; Setsuna confessed as
she snuggled closer to them, &quot;and began to think of
you together.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Michiru had a slight smile on her face as she
asked, &quot;In what way?&quot;

Setsuna smiled, eyes twinkling as she said, &quot;I&#39;ll tell
you about it sometime.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll look forward to that,&quot; Haruka chuckled.
&quot;Anyway,&quot; she continued with the story, &quot;I finally
confessed to Michiru that I was attracted to you,
expecting to be in deep trouble.&quot; She grinned,
&quot;Imagine my surprise when she admitted to having
similar feelings.&quot;

&quot;Once we understood that it wasn&#39;t a threat to our
relationship,&quot; Michiru slid a hand across Haruka&#39;s
ribs, &quot;we began to consider how to approach you.&quot;

Setsuna let her head rest on Haruka&#39;s shoulder as she
slid her hand over to rest on Michiru&#39;s. &quot;I was
actually going to tell you the night we had that
dinner about my own feelings,&quot; she said with a wry
smile, &quot;and do the noble thing by offering to move
out.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad that didn&#39;t happen,&quot; Michiru murmured.

&quot;What were you thinking&quot; Haruka asked curiously, &quot;when
we told you?&quot;

Setsuna had the cutest little blush to her cheeks as
she felt both women looking at her expectantly.. &quot;I
was a little scared,&quot; she admitted, &quot;and very
excited.&quot;

&quot;Like you are now?&quot; Michiru asked as she rose, the
nearly naked young woman climbing over Haruka to
gently kiss Setsuna.

Haruka smirked as the fabric of Michiru&#39;s nightie
stroked her body, reaching up to tickle the woman who
was climbing over her.

&quot;Eeek!&quot; Michiru squealed, thumping down.

Setsuna laughed only to be set upon by the two women,
both of them tickling her mercilessly. &quot;Stop,&quot; she
squealed, tears streaking her face.

Haruka laughed evily, &quot;Never!&quot;

&quot;You know,&quot; Michiru looked at Haruka with a impish
glint to her eyes, &quot;I think that she&#39;s all rested up,
don&#39;t you?&quot;

Setsuna smiled back, &quot;Oh yes.&quot;

Haruka&#39;s eyes widened slightly as she looked at the
two women just above her. &quot;I&#39;m doomed,&quot; Haruka
murmured.

&quot;And you wouldn&#39;t have it any other way,&quot; Michiru
laughed.

Watching from the safety of a tree outside the window
the little black cat shook her head as she muttered,
&quot;I don&#39;t believe this.&quot;

&quot;Told you so, Luna,&quot; the white cat smirked from where
he waited nearby.

Deciding she had seen more than enough Luna jumped
down to fall into step beside him, &quot;This is getting
ridiculous, Artemis. Them, and now Minako and Rei?&quot;

Artemis shrugged, at least as much as a cat could and
said, &quot;We should have expected it, really. You know
how much bed hopping was going on in the Moon Kingdom,
after all.&quot;

Luna looked concerned and asked, &quot;You don&#39;t think
they&#39;re regained those memories of their previous
lives, do you?&quot;

Artemis looked rather amused. &quot;I doubt it,&quot; he
answered, &quot;or else we&#39;d see some very interesting
things going on with Usagi.&quot;

Luna shuddered at that idea, &quot;If she ever remembers
that the Princess of the Moon Kingdom was bisexual
we&#39;re all in trouble.&quot;

&quot;Maybe Minako and Rei would ask her to join them,&quot; he
offered.

&quot;Don&#39;t ever suggest that to Minako, please,&quot; Luna
glared. She puffed out a sigh as they walked, &quot;At
least Ami and Makoto are staying out of trouble.&quot;

Artemis didn&#39;t say anything aloud but he had an impish
little smile on his face.

&quot;You have got to be kidding me,&quot; Luna groaned. She
gave Artemis a suspicious look, &quot;What are you, some
kind of peeping tom?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just looking out for the protection of the Sailor
Senshi,&quot; Artemis indignantly protested his innocence.

&quot;I&#39;m so sure,&quot; Luna grumbled.

The pretty blue haired woman almost flew down the
hallway of the apartment building, her school bad
slung over her shoulder. With a bit of red to her
cheeks she knocked, the quickness of the door opening
indicating someone had been waiting for her.

&quot;Ami,&quot; the taller brown haired woman smiled happily,
quickly bringing her inside before pulling her into a
gentle embrace, lips coming together.

&quot;Makoto,&quot; Ami sighed, relaxing in her arms after the
kiss. She looked up with a gentle smile, &quot;You have no
idea how good this feels.&quot;

&quot;Rough day?&quot; Makoto asked as she kept an arm around
Ami&#39;s shoulders and walked her over to the couch, a
tray of snacks set on the table for them.

&quot;You have no idea,&quot; Ami said as she snuggled into
Makoto. &quot;Mother wants to meet you, by the way,&quot; she
added casually.

Makoto blinked, &quot;She knows?&quot;

&quot;Not specifically,&quot; Ami reassured her with a smile,
&quot;but she&#39;s figured out I&#39;m going out with someone.&quot;
She puffed out a sigh, &quot;We had a mother daughter
talk.&quot;

Makoto chuckled at that mental image, &quot;That had to
have been fun.&quot;

&quot;It was funny in a way,&quot; Ami nodded, &quot;she found one of
my yuri mangas and talked about various kinds of
sexual activities we could safely engage in.&quot;

Makoto was eating something when Ami said that and
nearly choked. &quot;You&#39;re kidding,&quot; she looked down at
the blushing Ami.

&quot;No,&quot; Ami shook her head, &quot;I&#39;ve never been so
embarrassed in all my life.&quot;

&quot;Poor thing,&quot; Makoto pulled her closer. There was a
moment of silence then she smiled slightly, &quot;What sort
of things did she tell you?&quot;

Ami smiled, looking up at Makoto with a impish gleam
in her eyes. &quot;Do you want me to demonstrate?&quot; she
asked.

Makoto rose, gently tugging Ami up after her as she
said, &quot;We can eat something later.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not really hungry,&quot; Ami answered huskily as they
headed for the bedroom, &quot;or at least, not hungry for
food.&quot;

The End

Author&#39;s Notes: A short story on the Senshi, inspired
by some reader&#39;s comments to my other fics. The
relationships are in part a product of my imagination,
but there is some evidence in the manga to back it up.
The manga version of Rei Hino is arguably a lesbian,
with maybe one major relationship with a guy. She and
Minako Aino are also depicted in many suggestive
images, including one with Minako nearly drapped over
Rei as one says, &quot;We don&#39;t need boys.&quot; The rings that
the three Outers wear is also from the manga, though
any sexual relationship is purely the product of my
imagination. Is Setsuna a lesbian? The manga and anime
feature her as almost sexless, in many ways, but that
just leaves her wide open for fan speculation. If you
read this fic you&#39;ll notice the part two... I used
Luna and Artemis as the bridge and I included some
ideas of my own about Usagi and the Moon Kingdom. Ami
and Makoto are almost as often considered to be
couples as Haruka and Michiru and there&#39;s a certain
amount of evidence in the series to back it up.
