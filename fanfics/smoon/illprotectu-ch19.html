Whatever we are in other people&#39;s eyes

Won&#39;t bother you as long as I&#39;m all that you have

Knowing that is so warm and nice

Proving your sincerity and love

I regret I didn&#39;t tell you

How much your existence mean to me

I regret I&#39;m not exactly true

With those eyes you posses as blue as sea

I know I cannot go back

To fix the mistakes I already did

But please let me fill what I lack

In this person whom I mostly need

We have parted last time

But I&#39;ll find her no matter what

Put our love back in line

Fix things with this and that

And when the time comes we meet each other again, I hope I finally have 
the courage to tell her how I really feel...

--

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Mr. and Mrs. Aino, so far she&#39;s still safe and stable. All 
that we have to do now is stay by her side and wait for her to wake up&quot;

&quot;Thank very much Sensei. It was really a relief to hear from you that 
she&#39;s safe now&quot; Said Mrs. Aino(AN: &quot;Sensei&quot; is what they refer to a 
doctor in Japan...I read it from a subtitle)

&quot;It was nothing, really. I just did the rest of my job. It is the 
stranger who gave Minako-san first aid you should give your full thanks 
because if Minako-san wasn&#39;t given first aid that time, she could have 
died because of blood loss&quot; The doctor replied to Minako&#39;s parents

&quot;May the great Kami-sama bless that stranger&quot; Mr. Aino said

Suddenly a nurse came out from Minako&#39;s hospital room

&quot;Sensei! Sensei! Minako-san has awaken!&quot; She said

They all rushed inside the pop star&#39;s room and saw her surrounded by the 
other nurses and doctors. The pop star was shaking and it became worst 
when she saw other people approaching her. She couldn&#39;t stand being 
surrounded

&quot;Minako! How are you honey!&quot; Minako&#39;s mother asked

Minako gave her a blank look. Then she turned her head to the doctor who 
spoke to her

&quot;Minako-san, can you hear us?&quot;

Minako still looked blank and lost

&quot;Minako it&#39;s us, your mom and dad&quot; Mr. Aino spoke too

Mrs. Aino held Minako&#39;s shoulders gently. The pop star gasped at the 
contact

&quot;P-please...stay away from me&quot; Minako yelped

&quot;Honey--Minako, this is mom don&#39;t be scared&quot;

&quot;No! I&#39;m not...Minako! I&#39;m-I&#39;m...I...don&#39;t know my name! Leave me alone, 
I don&#39;t know you people!&quot; Minako curled herself into her knees and 
started to cry while her body is shaking uncontrollably

&quot;Okay, all the nurses except for Sahi, outside! Minako-san is still 
unwell and too much people here is really unnecessary&quot; The doctor 
commanded and all the nurse went out of the room with protest

&quot;What&#39;s the matter with my daughter, Sensei!&quot; Mr. Aino asked. Mrs. Aino 
is starting to cry at her daughter&#39;s side

&quot;She may still be in shock and stressed at what happened to her, Mr. 
Aino. But we&#39;ll observe her immediately. Nurse Sahi, help Sensei Hajiro 
give Minako-san tranquilizer to calm her down. We need to observe her 
wide awake&quot;

&quot;Yes, Sensei. Right away&quot; The nurse prepared the tranquilizer

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to say this to you, Mr. and Mrs. Aino but please stay outside 
for a while. It won&#39;t take long to configure her condition. Please stay 
calm&quot; The doctor explained to Minako&#39;s parents

--

-Outside the patient&#39;s waiting room-

Wendy silently waits from her seat when the door at Minako&#39;s room 
opened. Mr. and Mrs. Aino came out from the door

&quot;Mr. Aino, Mrs. Aino, what&#39;s wrong? Is something wrong with your 
daughter?&quot; Wendy asked, though she already knew that the answer is a bad 
news

--

Two weeks passed since what happened at the concert. The authority 
together with the help of the Tokyo National Police Headquarters they 
concluded that the group responsible for all of this is uncertain, but 
until the evidences are proven, Sanctuary is the primary blame of the 
TNPH. The head chief of TNPH, Hino Namada who luckily survived a gun 
shot that almost hit his heart, is one week suspended due to lack of 
responsibility as head commander of security of the concert. To his men 
at TNPH, it was definitely unfair but they have thought that it was also 
good for him because they think the big boss really deserved and needed 
a break

The authority found the pop star Minako Aino alone lying unconscious in 
the middle of Hongo Avenue, surrounded by few passerby, her head was 
tightly wrapped by a piece of clothing and is lying on a folded 
clothing, held tightly in her right hand is a badge belonged to a 
certain police. According to the passerby who first saw the pop star, a 
stranger must have given the injured pop star a first aid. So as the 
ambulance arrived they immediately brought the pop star to a nearest 
hospital. (AN: Any nearest hospital can accept patients with serious 
injuries that needs immediate medical attention from ambulances 
regardless of what hospital they came from)

Not far away from where the authority found the pop star is a burning 
carrier truck. There are dead figures of the kidnappers wearing masks 
and fake police uniforms lying around near the burning truck. There also 
bodies inside it. The only thing that made them wonder is who stopped 
the kidnappers from successfully kidnapping the pop star. The disaster 
at the concert has been in the news up until now

--

The head chief of Tokyo national police, together with agent Rinka 
Kimimoto, visited the hospital where the pop star Minako Aino was 
brought and tended. Different reporters from different TV and radio 
stations are seen at the corridors of the hospital, waiting for the 
latest news about the pop star&#39;s condition. Not even caring that they 
were bothering other patients in that hospital

The head chief wears a white long sleeve and brown slacks, while agent 
Rinka Kimimoto wears a blue turtle neck sleeveless blouse and black long 
skirt with short slit. They head towards the visitors room near Minako&#39;s 
room and waited patiently for a certain woman to go outside

Minutes later the door of the pop star&#39;s room opened and revealed a 
tired looking Wendy. She fixed her short blonde hair with her hand. Both 
the head chief and Rinka stood from their seats

&quot;Good Evening&quot; The head chief greeted

&quot;I&#39;m very glad you finally came here to visit, Mr. Hino&quot; Wendy greeted 
weakly. She took a glimpse and bowed at Rinka, who bowed back politely. 
Wendy noticed the young agent&#39;s eyes were sore and still teary, like any 
second she might cry. Then her eyes met the head chief&#39;s. It was full of 
sadness. Wendy doesn&#39;t need to ask why

&quot;I am truly sorry for your niece. I was also affected. I hope you find 
her soon. Please accept our prayers and support on behalf of my 
companions and Minako&#39;s parents&quot; Wendy gently said

A tear escaped Rinka&#39;s eyes as she tries to look away to anywhere but 
Wendy&#39;s. The head chief nodded weakly

&quot;Thank you. It was unexpected, and the last time we talked we had a 
little misunderstanding...I should have listened to her...If I only 
listened to her opinion that day she and Ms. Aino could have been still 
together...It was all my fault...&quot; The head chief said as he falls back 
to his seat and covered his tired face with one hand

&quot;Please don&#39;t blame yourself Mr. Hino. You did your job. It&#39;s the 
kidnappers that are to blame, the ones who made the mess. You&#39;re niece&#39;s 
life was at risk just to save Minako, I&#39;m sure she&#39;s--&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not dead&quot; Rinka suddenly interrupted

The head chief lifted his head

&quot;Agent Kimimoto...&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not the type that will just disappear. She might be somewhere 
else needing our help! You can&#39;t just stop the search!&quot; She spat again

&quot;We&#39;re not going to start this once again, I&#39;m warning you&quot; The head 
chief said heatedly, his fist is trembling

Rinka went silent then she relaxed a bit on her seat. She murmured some 
incoherent words that only she can understand. The head chief faced 
Wendy

&quot;How is Ms. Aino?&quot; He asked

Wendy let out a deep sigh

&quot;She&#39;s with her parents. She woke up three days ago&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;m so glad&quot; The head chief voice was broken

Wendy frowned, she covered her mouth before she began to sob and cry

&quot;But...but she couldn&#39;t remember us...she...doesn&#39;t know who she is&quot;

The head chief and Rinka couldn&#39;t believe what they&#39;re hearing

&quot;It can&#39;t be&quot; Rinka whispered

&quot;The doctor said it&#39;s a result from concussion, and her memory will come 
back pieces by pieces...but the catch is, it will take months. I feel 
sorry for her parents and Rei...if she finally finds out that Rei-&quot;

&quot;Ms. Wendy&quot; The head chief interrupted Wendy

&quot;Yes, Mr. Hino?&quot;

&quot;I have a favor to ask&quot;

&quot;Sir, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s-&quot;

Rinka was ignored

&quot;Please don&#39;t tell Ms. Aino anything about Rei or what happened to her&quot; 
He followed

&quot;W-why?&quot; Wendy asked in disbelief

&quot;I don&#39;t want to trouble Ms. Aino with it, if she knew that Rei 
mysteriously disappeared, she&#39;ll be upset and confused. In her 
condition, I&#39;m sure that she is not ready to accept it. Please keep this 
from her until she is ready or if Rei...somehow comes back&quot;

Wendy didn&#39;t know what to do that time but she nodded weakly

&quot;If Rei isn&#39;t here I won&#39;t. But if Minako&#39;s memory is fully restored, I 
will tell her. She has the right to know the truth&quot; She added

The head chief smiled weakly

&quot;I&#39;m glad you understand. How long is she going to stay at the 
hospital?&quot; he asked

&quot;She will be transferred to London tomorrow morning. She will have her 
immediate rehabilitation there. Her parents will be coming, although I&#39;m 
not blood-related, I&#39;ll be at her side&quot;

&quot;I see. So this will be the last time we&#39;ll see each other&quot; The head 
chief stretched his hand and shook hands with Wendy

&quot;I don&#39;t think so sir. This is Minako&#39;s home, if she decided to come 
back here, I will be with her&quot;

--

-Meanwhile at some place else-

In a huge quiet room is a girl lying on a queen-sized luxury bed, her 
sleeping form covered with thick white blanket. The girl slowly moved, 
and then she slowly rises up with eyes tightly closed. Her right hand 
tried to hold her head but discovered it has cast while the left 
supported her body. Her long black hair fell from her shoulders, her 
hand felt her neck, but there&#39;s something wrapped around it. Finally her 
eyes opened, revealing a pair of very dead violet orbs. She was startled 
when a voice near her spoke

&quot;Good morning, Ms. Rei. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re awake&quot; The voice belonged to a 
young girl

Rei tried to turn her neck but she couldn&#39;t. So the first words that 
came from her mouth are:

&quot;Get this thing off my neck&quot;

The girl who recently spoke approached and gently took the neck brace 
off Rei&#39;s neck. She felt a little sting at first but it disappeared 
somehow

&quot;I&#39;m Minerva. I&#39;m the nurse assigned to take care of you, Ms. Rei. I was 
given instructions by the doctor that once you wake up, I can take this 
off your neck...but that doesn&#39;t mean that you can stand up and walk so 
please lay down and rest&quot; Minerva instructed her

Rei wasn&#39;t sure if her mind registered all what Minerva just said. She 
looked at her nurse. Minerva has western looks, tall, slim...and blonde. 
This immediately reminds her of

&quot;Minako! Where is she! I need to see her--&quot;

&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry Ms. Rei but I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s impossible for you to do that 
now&quot; Minerva interrupted

&quot;I can go wherever I want to go don&#39;t try and stop me&quot; Rei kicked her 
thick white blankets away and stood up from her bed

&quot;Ms. Rei, please don&#39;t walk!&quot; Minerva tried to block her way but Rei 
accidentally pushed her out of the way

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I have to go&quot;

Rei finally went out of the door; her eyes were blinded by the sunlight 
coming from the large windows of the corridor. Then she marched at the 
big door at the end of the corridor and opened it. Behind that door is a 
huge living room, where there are maids standing at the wall and a 
butler at the end of the lane waiting for orders. Sitting at the elegant 
beige sofa set in the middle were Henry and Edward silently playing a 
crystal set of chess

On the other side of the sofa is Grey reading a newspaper while drinking 
a coffee, his brownish blonde hair wasn&#39;t spiky anymore but flat. In a 
glass table at the edge of the sofa stood Mark, pointing something at 
the wide paper lying flat at the glass table. He is talking to a young 
man with blue hair and brown eyes

&quot;Hey Mark, cop girl&#39;s finally up!&quot; Grey said as he stands up to help Rei 
but Edward&#39;s already in front of her. Minerva nervously speaks first

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Master Edward, I tried to stop her but-&quot;

&quot;Never mind that. Get a wheel chair for her, Minerva&quot; Edward interrupted 
the nurse

&quot;Yes, right away Master Edward!&quot; Minerva shakily walked back to the 
corridor where she and Rei came from

&quot;I don&#39;t need a wheel chair, I can walk!&quot; Rei protested

&quot;But you&#39;ll exhaust yourself. You&#39;re not well enough Rei&quot; Said Edward

&quot;Don&#39;t baby her, Ed. She&#39;ll get more stubborn&quot; Henry said before letting 
out a chuckle

&quot;Where&#39;s Minako!&quot; Rei asked as she interrupt Henry&#39;s chuckle

Everybody went silent

&quot;I want to see her&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s in a hospital in Tokyo, she woke up three days ago before 
you...You&#39;re more sleepy head than your girl-&quot;

&quot;I-WANT-TO-SEE-HER...NOW!&quot;

&quot;...Rei you can&#39;t...we can&#39;t do that for now&quot; Edward spoke

&quot;Why can&#39;t I?&quot;

Mark rolled the paper lying on the glass table that caught everyone&#39;s 
attention because of his sudden movement. Then he finally spoke

&quot;You can&#39;t because you&#39;re here in Edinburgh, Hino-chan. You&#39;re in United 
Kingdom...&quot;

&quot;...And Minako is still in Japan&quot; He added

Rei suddenly feel dizzy and held her forehead with a hand, she fell 
knee-first at the clean floor

&quot;Rei!&quot; Edward knelt beside her

&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea telling her that, Markie&quot; Grey commented

Minerva appeared once again behind Rei and Edward. She was pushing a 
wheel chair. She was startled when she noticed everyone is looking at 
her

&quot;...Er...I brought the wheel chair?&quot;
