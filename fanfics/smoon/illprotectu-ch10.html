<h1>I'll Protect You (part 10 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a>

<a href="../smoon/illprotectu-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>&quot;Ready to pay for the ticket?&quot; Minako asked menacingly

&quot;So that&#39;s the purpose of leaving my blouse open&quot; Teased Rei

&quot;Wait here&quot; Minako said as she rises up and approached the stereo; she 
replaced the Beethoven CD with her Album and played the seventh track

The song is a slow one this time. Minako went back to join Rei

&quot;That&#39;s my favorite song in that album&quot; The pop star said as she laid 
herself on top of her lover

Rei closed her eyes to focus and listen to the song while Minako watches 
her patiently

&quot;Hmmm...I agree. The song is really soothing&quot;

Minako sighed in relief. Rei reached her hand to open a drawer beside 
her bed and took a small bottle out of it&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that Rei-chan?&quot; Minako asked while looking curiously at the 
bottle

&quot;It&#39;s scented oil. I know you were rehearsing your dance while I was 
away so I figured that you might need a little massage&quot; Rei said

&quot;Wow, how thoughtful Rei-chan...Are you escaping from my clutches?&quot;

&quot;Of course not, just wait and let me give you a massage first then...&quot;

Rei gulped

&quot;...Then I can do what I want?&quot; Minako continued

&quot;Well&#151;yeah. Whatever you want&quot; Rei agreed while blushing

&quot;Okay!&quot; Minako merrily said as she straighten her legs for Rei to start 
her massage

Rei started from Minako&#39;s feet all the way up to her legs. While doing 
that Minako is busy reading Rei&#39;s book entitled &quot;Cold Summer&quot; to 
lengthen her patience. Then Rei took her left hand and started massaging 
her fingers

Minako looked at Rei as her lover massages her elbow. She couldn&#39;t wait 
for the massage to finish anymore; she leaned and kissed Rei&#39;s neck

&quot;Hey, I told you to wait until I finished right?&quot; Rei pouted

&quot;Just continue that, don&#39;t mind me&quot; Said the pop star as she still works 
on her lover&#39;s neck. Rei just sighed and continue massaging Minako&#39;s 
shoulder

-Gendou-Takasama Studio-

&quot;Ms. Wendy, where on earth is Minako?&quot; The choreographer asked

&quot;She&#39;s uh...not feeling well?&quot; Wendy said with uncertainty

&quot;Then why are you still here?&quot;

&quot;I was just having a long talk with the concert director; he offered me 
a ride back to the hotel so that&#39;s why I&#39;m still here&quot; Explained Wendy

&quot;Then when you get to her tell her we got a new dance strategy, we have 
to practice that so she must rest well&quot; Replied the choreographer as he 
walks away from Wendy

Wendy sighed

&quot;Aino, you better come back early tomorrow&quot; She desperately whispered

-----

-Back to Rei&#39;s-

&quot;Rei-chan, when are you going to finish this?&quot; Minako whined as Rei 
massage her smooth back

&quot;Ooh, my Mina-chan is getting impatient. Just let me massage your 
temples and then I&#39;m done&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re enjoying my body ne?&quot; Minako teased

&quot;Very much&quot; Rei admitted

&quot;Is that so? Wait &#39;til I enjoy yours&quot;

It&#39;s now eight in the evening and Minako didn&#39;t realize she slept in 
Rei&#39;s massage, much to Rei&#39;s relief. But little does she know that 
Minako won&#39;t let her slip that easy

&quot;Whew, good thing she slept. She needed rest anyway&quot; Rei whispered as 
she gently kissed Minako&#39;s lips and wrapped a blanket to her lover and 
hugged her. Then she started to close her eyes so that she can sleep 
peacefully like Minako

Few minutes later Rei was awakened when somebody gently took her 
sleeping blouse off

&quot;M-Minako?&quot; Rei asked sleepily. Then Minako kissed her lips 
aggressively, making Rei out of breath

&quot;You think your massage will make me sleep effectively and forget my 
plan?&quot; Asked Minako evilly

&quot;I didn&#39;t expect you to sleep, really. I just thought you were tired&quot; 
Rei explained

&quot;Me? Tired? Ha! I&#39;ll never sleep tonight until I get what I wanted!&quot; 
Minako said to Rei&#39;s ears that send shiver to the policewoman

But Rei was sleepy enough to respond

&quot;Well then, do whatever you want. I really wanted to sleep&quot;

&quot;What? But that&#39;s unfair!&quot; Minako pouted at her lover and began to shake 
Rei mercilessly to wake her up. But her bodyguard is now peacefully 
asleep

&quot;If you think I&#39;ll give up then you&#39;re wrong&quot; Minako continued as she 
now started to unhook Rei&#39;s brassiere

Rei woke up again, this time, wide eyed. Then she stopped Minako from 
unhooking her bra

&quot;Hey, hold it&quot; Rei said as she held her bra in place

Minako giggled

&quot;Come on Rei-chan, I&#39;ll be busy starting tomorrow and I couldn&#39;t loose 
this opportunity to be here with you tonight&quot; Minako begged

Rei sighed, growled then nodded

&quot;Alright, alright. But only for an hour, you said it yourself that we 
are early tomorrow&quot; Rei said as she lets go from holding her bra and 
allowed Minako to work on her that night

-----

-Morning came-

Minako opened her sparkling blue eyes as she started to wake up. She 
yawned and stretch, then she looked at the time: 6:12 am. She smiled, 
well, still early. Then she finally regarded the person she had wanted 
to see since she woke up. Rei is still sleeping; her bangs covered her 
eyes so Minako shove it off. Rei moved a little, and then she mumbled 
dreamily

&quot;Minako...I love you...&quot; Then Rei shifted and continued to sleep

Minako just smiled and kissed Rei&#39;s forehead

&quot;Love you too, Rei-chan. But you better wake up, we&#39;ll go straight back 
to the hotel this morning&quot; Minako said then she rises up and walked 
towards the kitchen. Rei finally awakes and rose up and looked at Minako 
sleepily

&quot;Wha--? Morning already?&quot; Rei pouted as she walks towards Minako to give 
the pop star a good morning kiss on her lips

&quot;You take a bath first, I&#39;ll call Wendy in my cell phone&quot; Minako 
commanded Rei who instantly followed her

Then Minako dialed Wendy&#39;s number

&quot;Hello Wends?&quot;

&quot;Finally, Aino, a sign!&quot; Wendy said in the other line

&quot;Rei and I are coming back there now, you wait for us&quot; Minako said

&quot;Okay, make it fast and have your breakfast here. After the visit with 
the Minister, you&#39;ll get back immediately to the studio. Mr. Hilton said 
that there is a sudden change on the dance strategy&quot; Wendy said

&quot;Okay!&quot; Minako was about to drop the line

&quot;Aino, wait&quot; Wendy catches up

&quot;What is it Wends?&quot;

&quot;Uh...Did you and Ms. Hino...er...enjoy yourselves there last night?&quot; 
Wendy asked hesitantly

Minako smiled widely

&quot;You can never imagine how much happiness I have felt last night Wendy, 
thanks for your permission and for covering me up&quot; Minako said with all 
gratitude

&quot;I just want you to be inspired, Aino. I hope you can write more songs 
for your next album. But I told you that this will be that last time 
I&#39;ll cover up for you okay?&quot; Wendy said

&quot;Don&#39;t worry I won&#39;t let you lie to the others again! And I&#39;ll even tell 
you what happened between Rei and I last night&quot; Minako winked as she 
said that

&quot;Yeah, sure. See you at the hotel Aino&quot;

&quot;Bye Wends&quot; Then Minako closed her cell phone

-----

-Tokyo National Police Headquarters-

&quot;Hey, Hajiro! Take a look at this new mail!&quot; The blonde police called 
his companion

The second police looked at the laptop of his blond companion. After he 
read the content of the mail his face turned into a worried one

&quot;Who the hell sent this?&quot; He asked

&quot;I don&#39;t know. Whoever sent this letter must have been an expert hacker. 
He left no trace on where or when he had actually sent this e-mail. I 
tried to locate it but it started to send bugs at my laptop&quot; The blond 
police said

The second police paused to think

&quot;This must be the Sanctuary&#39;s doing! They had been terrorizing concerts 
here in Tokyo. We must inform head chief Hino right away!&quot;

&quot;Roger that&quot;

The second police went to the head chief&#39;s office immediately

&quot;What is it Hajiro?&quot; The head chief asked

&quot;Chief! We have received a death threat from Sanctuary!&quot;

-----

-Back to Rei&#39;s-

&quot;Mina-chan?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Uhh...&quot;

&quot;What is it Rei-chan?&quot; Minako asked her lover as Rei braids Minako&#39;s 
hair

&quot;...Never mind&quot;

&quot;Rei-chan tell me&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not really important&quot; Rei said

&quot;Whatever word that would come from you is important to me so spill it&quot; 
Minako said. She noticed Rei is blushing again

&quot;Rei-chan, I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re still shy at me. That really bothers 
me. A lot&quot; Minako frowned

&#39;Argh, you&#39;re upsetting her Hino. Why can&#39;t I just act natural in front 
of her in this kind of situation?&#39;

&quot;Rei-chan&quot; Minako called her again

Rei closed her eyes then tucked her head at Minako&#39;s hair and back

&quot;rarwiririgurfrnw?&quot; Rei said in Minako&#39;s back, her voice is blurring. 
Minako didn&#39;t even understand a single word her lover said

&quot;Rei-chan, I don&#39;t speak &#39;Rei Language&#39;&quot; Minako smiled when she heard 
her lover growl at her back

&quot;Are we really&#151;girlfriends...now?&quot; Rei gulped

Minako blinked a few times then laughed hysterically. Rei took her head 
off Minako&#39;s back and dropped facedown at a nearby table to hide her 
crimson face from her lover

&#39;StupidStupidStupid&#39;

Minako followed Rei at the table and laid her head at Rei&#39;s back

&quot;I used to beat men with my fists fiercely. Now I can&#39;t even ask you a 
simple question?&quot; Rei whined

&quot;Hey, sorry I laughed at you. I just didn&#39;t know that you were that 
stuck up and afraid to ask that question to me. But I&#39;m really glad you 
asked that&quot; Minako said

&quot;To tell you it all happened so fast yesterday. And with all that we did 
last night? Yes, we are girlfriends for sure&quot; The pop star declared. 
Then Rei lift her head up

&quot;Rei-chan, please don&#39;t hesitate to ask me anything next time&quot;

&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll practice that&quot;

&quot;Then back to work and fix my hair here&quot; Rei merrily went back to braid 
Minako&#39;s hair and Minako wore her retainers and huge shades again

As they went out Rei&#39;s apartment they ride a taxi on their way back to 
the hotel. Minako noticed Rei fell asleep and laid her head at Minako&#39;s 
shoulder

Minako just smiled. She really made Rei tired that night :P

&quot;Minako?&quot; Rei mumbled

&quot;Yes, Rei-chan?&quot;

&quot;Next time, it&#39;s going to be my turn&quot; Rei whispered, her eyes still 
closed

&quot;...Can&#39;t wait for that day&quot; Minako said as she giggled lightly

Then they finally arrived at the back of the hotel. Rei showed her badge 
to the hotel staff and they let them inside. They made their way to 
Minako&#39;s hotel room and Wendy opened the door for them

&quot;Sorry we made you worry and wait for us, Ms. Wendy&quot; Rei apologized

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it Ms. Hino, I always get used to Minako when she 
recklessly decides to take a day off herself&quot; Wendy winked at Rei. Then 
she turned to look at Minako

&quot;Aino, nice retainers&quot; Wendy commented

&quot;You had a good night, hmm?&quot; Minako teased

&quot;Yup. The concert director is really nice. He even gave me a ride back 
here&quot; Wendy said

Minako pinched Rei&#39;s arm

&quot;Ouch, what was that for?&quot; Rei hissed

&quot;I told you to call Agent Rinka to escort Ms. Wendy and you&#39;ve 
forgotten?&quot; Minako whispered

&quot;I&#39;m sorry...Forgot about that&quot; Rei apologized at her lover

Wendy just watched them amusingly

&quot;Well, better dress up now Aino. You&#39;ll be working the whole day&quot; Wendy 
said and Minako pinched Rei&#39;s nose then walked to towards the dressing 
room

Rei rubbed her pinched nose

&quot;Minako is really thoughtful in everyone around her&quot; Wendy commented

&quot;I agree with you Ms. Wendy&quot;

&quot;Ms. Hino?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Ms. Wendy?&quot;

&quot;Are you ready to face the world of Minako?&quot; Wendy asked

Rei got a bit confused but she had picked up what Wendy meant

&quot;Yes&quot;</pre>
