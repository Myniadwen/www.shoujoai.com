<h1>Darkness (part 4 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/saiyagurl.html">Saiyagurl87</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/darkness-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Amara and Michelle walked into the three little vampires room to see 
them all asleep. Rei was in the middle as Hotaru and Serena were at 
Rei&#39;s left and right. Michelle went to Hotaru since she was the 
closest and shook the little girl awake. Hotaru opened up her sleepy 
purple eyes to be met with aqua colored ones.

Amara made her way to Rei and shook her awake. Rei grumpily opened her 
eyes and saw Amara. She slightly glared up at the woman for disturbing 
her sleep. Amara chuckled softly at the usual routine and turned to 
Serena.

The young girl was tossing , turning and mumbling incoherent words in 
her sleep. Amara walked over to the distraught girl who had tears 
running down her flushed and sweaty face. Amara grabbed onto Serena&#39;s 
arms which were swinging about wildly. Rei looked at Serena as was 
Michelle who was know holding a wide awake Hotaru.

Amara began to shake Serena as the girl&#39;s movements became more 
violent.

&quot;Rei, go get me some water.&quot;, replied Amara. Rei got off the bed and 
rushed into the bathroom. She picked up a cup that was on counter and 
filled it up. Rei came back in the room and handed the to Amara. Rei 
stood next to Amara as she began to pour the water on Serena&#39;s face.

Everything went still and quiet as Serena laid there panting slightly. 
Slowly her eye&#39;s opened and she looked around in confusion. &#39;Why is 
everyone looking at me?&#39; thought Serena as she looked around at 
everyone. Amara cautiously let go Serena&#39;s hand and took a step back.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot;,asked Michelle from across the room. Serena sat up and 
nodded her head.

&quot;Okay, you guys get dressed. We&#39;ll be outside waiting for you.&quot;, 
replied Amara.

&quot;Serena your clothes are in the draw by the table.&quot;, said Michelle as 
she placed Hotaru on the bed. The two women left the room silently and 
closed the door behind them. Hotaru and Rei turned their gazes from 
the door to Serena.

&quot;What was all that about?&quot;, asked Rei snottily.

&quot;Yeah, you were going crazing and talking and crying in your sleep.&quot;, 
exclaimed Hotaru. Serena put a hand to her cheek and indeed felt the 
tears on her face.

&quot;It was a nightmare that I don&#39;t want to talk about.&quot;, said Serena as 
she walked over to her dresser. Serena opened up the dressers and 
pulled out a pair of black sweat pants, black tank top, underwear and 
socks. Serena turned around and headed towards the bathroom.

Rei saw Serena about to go into the bathroom and put up a sly smile. 
She picked up her clothes and rushed past Serena into the bathroom and 
slammed the door shut. Serena stepped back in surprise and growled and 
clenched her teeth shut in frustration.

&quot;This girl is impossible.&quot;, yelled Serena. Hotaru looked up at Serena 
and then at the door where her sister had ran into. Hotaru then shook 
her head in sympathy for Serena.

&quot;You know, she wasn&#39;t always like that.&quot;, said Hotaru. Serena turned 
from the door to Hotaru.

&quot;What?&quot;, asked Serena.

&quot;I said that she wasn&#39;t always like that.&quot;, said Hotaru. Serena walked 
away from the door and sat on Hotaru&#39;s bed.

&quot;What happened to the both of you?&quot;, asked Serena.

&quot;Well it was about a couple a months ago. Our family was having a 
cookout. It was in the evening and it was just us, mom, dad, and 
grandpa Hino. We were having a real good time. It was getting late out 
and we all went inside to watch TV. Suddenly a couple of guys broke 
into our house and started shouting at my parents and grandpa. Grandpa 
told Rei and I to go upstairs for a little while.&quot;, said Hotaru. 
Hotaru sighed as her voice began to crack and the tears began to well 
up in her eyes. Serena sat quietly and listened intently to the little 
girl.

&quot;Rei and I went upstairs, but not all the way. We sat on the stairs to 
see what was going on. One of the men with black ebony hair grabbed 
grandpa as another with blonde hair started to push daddy around. I 
saw mom try to help daddy, but was being held back by another guy. 
Then the one with the blonde hair took a pointy stick and stabbed it 
into daddy&#39;s heart and the one with the black ebony hair did the same 
to grandpa. We watched as they were both turned to dust.&quot;, Hotaru 
paused as she choked on a sob and wiped away her tears. Rei sat on the 
bathroom floor listening intently to the conversation. She too had 
tears making trails down her face.

&quot;The two guys laughed as we dared to look at mom. Mom looked at us and 
screamed for us to leave, but we were to scared to move. We watched as 
a man brought down a stick into mommy&#39;s chest. She mouthed that she 
loved us before she was turned into dust. The men turned to us and 
smiled before they started walking to us. Rei grabbed my hand and we 
ran up the stairs. We went into Rei&#39;s room, locked the door and opened 
up the window. The men burst through the door and began running 
towards us. Rei and I opened up the window and we both jumped out. We 
ran away and soon were found by Amara and Michelle.&quot;, finished Hotaru.

Hotaru cried out openly as her body racked with sobs. She missed her 
family so much. Serena immediately went to the crying girl and hugged 
her tightly. She rocked Hotaru and rubbed her back until she calmed 
down. Hotaru sniffled a couple of times before she smiled up at 
Serena.

&quot;Thanks.&quot;, said Hotaru.

&quot;For what?&quot;, asked Serena.

&quot;For being my shoulder to cry on.&quot;, said Hotaru before she went to 
gather her clothes. Serena smiled and then turned towards the bathroom 
door. Rei sat on the other side and cried. She hadn&#39;t cried on the 
fateful day and know she couldn&#39;t hold back anymore.

Rei moved away from the door and curled up into a ball underneath the 
bathroom sink. Serena got up and walked towards the door and turned 
towards Hotaru who was dressed and ready.

&quot;Your not going to take a bath?&quot;, asked Serena. Hotaru shook her head 
&#39;no&#39;.

&quot;I took a bath last night. Plus I&#39;ll take a bath after our training is 
over.&quot;, said Hotaru as she walked out of the room.

Serena&#39;s attention turned from Hotaru closing the bedroom door to the 
bathroom door. She walked towards the door and heard a slight weeping 
sound. Serena opened up the door cautiously and looked around while 
calling Rei&#39;s name. Serena saw the raven haired girl with her face in 
her lap and body shaking harshly.

Serena walked up to Rei and wrapped her arms around the girl. Rei 
began struggling which caused Serena&#39;s hold to get tighter. Soon Rei 
stopped struggling and rested languidly against Serena&#39;s warm embrace. 
Rei took in the serene warmth and comfort from Serena&#39;s embrace.

Serena brushed her fingers through Rei&#39;s hair and slightly rocked the 
girl back and forth like she did to Hotaru earlier. Serena finally sat 
down and brought Rei into her lap to get more comfortable. Serena 
began whispering words of comfort to Rei and rubbed Rei&#39;s back to stop 
the girl from shaking.

*****************

Hotaru walked out of the bedroom and saw Amara and Michelle. She 
walked up to the two women who were talking quietly amongst 
themselves. They turned towards her at hearing her footsteps.

&quot;Where&#39;s Serena and Rei?&quot;, asked Michelle.

&quot;Still in the room.&quot;, said Hotaru. Amara sighed and began walking to 
the girls bedroom.

&quot;I&#39;ll go check on them.&quot;, said Amara as she walked into the room. 
Amara walked in the room and saw neither of the girls. Amara called 
out their names, but got no reply. Amara looked at the bathroom door 
and advanced towards it. Once near the door she slightly cracked it 
opened. She saw Rei being held by Serena crying. Amara decided not to 
bother them and walked out of the room.

&quot;So, what are they doing?&quot;, asked Michelle.

&quot;It&#39;s nothing. Let&#39;s go on without them.&quot;, said Amara. Michelle raised 
her an eyebrow questioningly, but decided not to ask. She watched as 
Amara picked up Hotaru and walked away. Michelle sighed slightly 
before following her lover&#39;s footsteps.

******************

Rei&#39;s crying went down to mere sniffles and felt comfortable in 
Serena&#39;s arms. Serena still spoke in whispers to Rei and absent 
mindedly stroked Rei&#39;s hair. Rei looked up at Serena who had her eye&#39;s 
closed with her face buried in her hair.

&quot;Serena&quot;,whispered Rei.

&quot;Hmm&quot;, murmured Serena.

&quot;I apologies.&quot;, said Rei.

&quot;For what?&quot;, asked Serena.

&quot;For the way I treated you. It was disrespectful and I apologies.&quot;, 
said Rei.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to, but I&#39;ll accept it none the less&quot;, replied Serena. 
&quot;But only under one condition.&quot; Rei raised and eyebrow in curiosity.

&quot;Which is ?&quot; asked Rei.

&quot;That we&#39;ll be the best of friends and always be there for each 
other.&quot;, said Serena.

&quot;Fine by me.&quot;, said Rei as she stood from Serena&#39;s arms. She slightly 
shivered from the lack of warmth.

&quot;Come on Serena, we have to get ready.&quot;, said Rei. Serena slightly 
groaned before she got up.

&quot;Coming.&quot;, said Serena.
