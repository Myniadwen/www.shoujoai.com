<h1>Crystal Tokyo, California (part 5 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/cali-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&quot;Do you think Emi isn&#39;t telling us the whole truth about her?&quot; Haruka 
asked Setsuna quietly, walking beside the taller woman through the 
nearly silent halls of the Palace. It was very early, earlier than 
Haruka normally every woke up, but Setsuna had said it was necessary, 
and a request from her was good enough for Haruka.

&quot;Probably,&quot; Setsuna answered her quietly, &quot;I do think she lied about 
why she came here, but she&#39;ll tell us the truth when she&#39;s ready.&quot; She 
was dressed casually, her morning dress unadorned with any finery, but 
she still had a presence about her.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t bother you having someone around here who&#39;s lying to you?&quot; 
Haruka asked her, just a bit surprised. She reached down to adjust her 
gunbelts, carefully making sure each pistol rested comfortably on her 
slim hips.

&quot;Serenity didn&#39;t tell me the whole truth when I first met her,&quot; 
Setsuna pointed out to Haruka gently, &quot;I didn&#39;t learn about her having 
a daughter for weeks. Of course, at that point I much didn&#39;t care,&quot; 
she chuckled. More seriously, &quot;Let&#39;s give the girl a chance, first.&quot;

&quot;I guess so,&quot; Haruka sighed softly as they walked outside together. It 
was still dark out, the sun only just beginning to peek over the 
eastern hills. Makoto puffed as she heaved something up on to the 
waiting wagon.

&quot;You want to give me a hand, please?&quot; Makoto asked with a smile.

Haruka helped heave the other steel lockbox up on top of the wagon. 
She turned to Setsuna, gesturing to the box and one resting beside it, 
&quot;So we need to make sure we meet this caravan bound back east, and 
deliver the two of these?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Setsuna nodded, &quot;the money we&#39;ll get for the sale of them will 
keep the town afloat for another few months.&quot;

Ami walked out of the Palace, and then Makoto climbed up to take the 
reins in hand. She put a shotgun down beside her, &quot;I&#39;m your back up, 
Haruka.&quot;

&quot;And if anyone is hurt,&quot; Ami said to Haruka calmly, &quot;I&#39;ll be along to 
make sure we all make it back here all right.&quot;

&quot;I suppose I can&#39;t talk you two out of this?&quot; Haruka asked them.

&quot;You could try to order us off, I suppose,&quot; Makoto said calmly, &quot;but I 
bet we could get Setsuna to order us back on, again.&quot;

Haruka looked over at Setsuna, &quot;I should have guessed.&quot; Setsuna just 
smiled over at her innocently and didn&#39;t say anything.

Michiru walled out of the Palace and up to Haruka. &quot;Be careful, 
please,&quot; she said softly, looking up into Haruka&#39;s eyes.

&quot;I always am,&quot; Haruka answered quietly. She bent down and gently 
brushed her lips across Michiru&#39;s, &quot;I&#39;ll be back, I promise.&quot;

Michiru reluctantly let Haruka go, and she watched worriedly as Haruka 
climbed up with Makoto in the front and Ami on the wagon&#39;s bed, her 
doctor&#39;s bag resting there beside her.

&quot;Do you think something&#39;s going to happen to them?&quot; Usagi asked 
Setsuna softly.

&quot;I hope not,&quot; Setsuna said, turning to smile at the younger girl. She 
noticed that Hotaru was hanging around again, and wondered how long 
she was going to have to pretend she didn&#39;t know the two of them were 
involved.

&quot;They&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Hotaru reassured Usagi gently. The shorter blond 
looked up at the dark hared woman adoringly, and Setsuna had to hide a 
smile. She slipped away, leaving the two there to their romantic 
moment.

Emerald came downstairs, her hair messy from just getting out of bed. 
She smiled over at Setsuna, &quot;Good morning, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Just call me Setsuna,&quot; she answered her with a smile. &quot;How was your 
night, Emi?&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t had such a comfortable bed to rest in for months,&quot; Emerald 
admitted with a smile. &quot;Do you want me to help Makoto with breakfast?&quot; 
she asked.

&quot;We&#39;re not opening the kitchen this morning,&quot; Setsuna sighed, &quot;Makoto 
is helping Haruka guard the shipment today.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Emerald said. &quot;Would you mind if I go back to my room 
to get ready for the day?&quot; she asked with a smile. With that, she 
hurried up to her room, digging through her stuff until she found the 
hand mirror Diamond had given her.

With more than a twinge of guilt she leaned out her second floor 
window, reflecting the morning sunlight into the hills just outside of 
town. She delivered the coded signal, the sequence of flashes they had 
agreed on earlier, then she quickly ducked back into her room.

&#39;I work for Diamond,&#39; Emerald thought to herself grimly, &#39;No matter 
how much I may like these people, my duty is clear.&#39;



Birdy trotted down into the rough encampment, her long braid of blue 
hair swinging behind her as she ran. She loudly declared, &quot;There&#39;s 
finally been a signal from Emerald!&quot;

&quot;What did she say?&quot; Prisma asked her quickly.

&quot;Dash dash, dot, dash dash, long pause, and then...&quot; Birdy trailed off 
under the combined glares of her sisters. More quietly, &quot;She says the 
stagecoach is moving out, but she doesn&#39;t have a direction it&#39;s going 
in.&quot;

&quot;Without giving us a direction to go it&#39;s not very useful information, 
is it?&quot; Avery asked the others tentatively, tending their breakfast 
carefully.

&quot;That&#39;s not necessarily so,&quot; Sapphire spoke up coolly. &quot;There&#39;s only 
one really good pass they can take to reach the main caravan route,&quot; 
he calmly pointed out to them, &quot;we can just try to intercept her 
there.&quot;

Catsy clasped her hands in front of her, large hearts appearing in her 
eyes as she said to him admiringly, &quot;You&#39;re so smart, Sapphire!&quot;

Sapphire sweatdropped a bit at that. &quot;Break out the guns and let&#39;s go 
get the horses,&quot; he commanded, &quot;we&#39;ll take a shot at stopping them at 
the pass.&quot;

Soon the odd looking gang rode off in pursuit of riches. Sapphire took 
the lead, and he could hear the girls talking together just behind 
him.

&quot;You&#39;re riding too close!&quot; &quot;That&#39;s because you never learned to ride 
well!&quot; &quot;My butt hurts, can we take a break?&quot; &quot;We just started!&quot; &quot;But 
my horse has a bony back!&quot; &quot;Be quiet, I want to hear anything Sapphire 
says to us!&quot;

Sapphire sighed softly to himself. He didn&#39;t know where Rubius had 
found those sisters, but it was times like this he wished he could 
just send them right back there. &quot;Be quiet,&quot; he said over his shoulder 
to them, &quot;I&#39;m trying to think.&quot;

&quot;You heard him, be quiet!&quot; &quot;Why, I&#39;m not the one being loud!&quot; &quot;Both of 
you shut up!&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t shout at me!&quot; &quot;My butt still hurts.&quot; And so on...

Sapphire sighed again, and tried to put a bit more distance between 
him and them. It was going to be a very long ride, he just knew it.



Haruka rested her hand on her holster, then she smoothly drew out her 
gun, checking on the bullets calmly as the wagon rattled along the 
dusty track. &quot;Is there trouble on these trips very often?&quot; she asked 
Makoto.

&quot;Before Diamond came along, we only had the occasional bandit trying 
to make some trouble. But now, Diamond seems to be determined to stop 
any shipments he can,&quot; Makoto said grimly, holding the reins in one 
hand and the shotgun in another.

&quot;Him and those crazy girls he has working for him and his gang,&quot; Ami 
said with a impish little smile on her face.

&quot;Crazy girls?&quot; Haruka echoed her encouragingly.

Makoto decided to explain, &quot;There&#39;s four of them.&quot; She gave a little 
laugh, &quot;Avery, Birdy, Catsy and Prisma, I think.&quot; She shrugged, &quot;But 
they&#39;re so incompetent that they&#39;re more a threat to each other than 
they are to us.&quot;

&quot;Hopefully, you won&#39;t get to meet them today,&quot; Ami said to Haruka 
optimistically. Makoto smiled slightly, but Haruka stayed serious.

Haruka really wanted to agree with her, but her gut was telling her 
something else. &quot;Ami,&quot; Haruka asked her quietly, &quot;do you carry a gun, 
too?&quot;

&quot;Do no harm,&quot; Ami said softly in reply, &quot;is the doctor&#39;s oath, 
Haruka.&quot; She smiled, &quot;So no, I don&#39;t carry a weapon.&quot;

&quot;I can respect that,&quot; Haruka nodded. A pause, and, &quot;If the shooting 
does start, make sure to hit the wagon bed and stay there, please.&quot;

&quot;Both of us can concentrate on the fight that way,&quot; Makoto spoke up, 
as Ami was about to loudly protest that order.

Ami sighed softly, &quot;All right.&quot;

They rode on, Haruka looking around her at the dusty hills, the land 
scoured clean by the regular winds. The earth was a rust brown, and if 
you tried to talk too much, you found yourself eating a mouthful of 
fine dust.

Haruka pulled her bandana up over her mouth, feeling mildly bandit 
like as she did so. &quot;How close are we to the pass?&quot; she asked Makoto.

&quot;It&#39;s not far,&quot; Makoto replied softly, covering her own mouth. Ami had 
already done it, a few steps ahead of them both.

&quot;Get the horses ready to run,&quot; was Haruka&#39;s soft answer, &quot;if they&#39;re 
going to try and take the shipment, the pass is the place to do it.&quot;

Makoto made sure the shotgun was ready, &quot;Got it.&quot;

They came around a bend, and saw Sapphire and the four ladies waiting 
for them, guns ready. &quot;Now!&quot; Haruka yelled, and Makoto slapped the 
reins against the horses backs.

Startled, the horses lurched forward, charging at breakneck speen 
towards the five people standing there in front of them. The four 
girls followed their reflexes and jumped aside, but Sapphire stood his 
ground just long enought to raise his pistol and get off a single 
shot.

Suddenly, Makoto jerked in her seat. She swayed, but stayed there with 
the quickly offered helping hand from Haruka.

&quot;Makoto!&quot; Ami cried out, climbing up from the wagon bed beside her. 
She breathed a soft sigh of relied, realizing it was only a flesh 
wound to the arm. Haruka sat calmly beside them, and Ami was struck 
with an irrational anger, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you shoot back?&quot;

Haruka didn&#39;t answer for a moment, grabbing the reins herself and 
slowing the horses down a bit. &quot;I didn&#39;t have a good shot at them,&quot; 
she said coolly, &quot;and I hate wasting bullets.&quot; She looked pointedly at 
Makoto, &quot;She going to be all right?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ami said, just a bit unnerved by Haruka&#39;s calm. She realized 
this was the gunfighter side of the young woman, a side of her the 
townspeople hadn&#39;t yet seen. &quot;It&#39;s just a minor wound,&quot; Ami added 
quietly.

&quot;Good,&quot; Haruka said, &quot;then we&#39;ll finish the delivery.&quot; She threw a 
smile at Ami, &quot;Then you can take Makoto home and bathe her in TLC.&quot;

Ami actually blushed a bit at that, &quot;Right.&quot; She bandaged Makoto&#39;s 
arm, and then helped her back up to her seat by Haruka.

&quot;Let me drive,&quot; Makoto said, &quot;you need to be ready in case they come 
back.&quot; Haruka surrendered the reins with a greatful smile.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Haruka said with a calm smile. They reached the caravan 
route, the two boxes were unloaded, and Haruka&#39;s eyes nearly bugged 
out as the caravan began loading up the wagon. There were bags of 
seed, barrels of wine, lots of food, as well as a variety of supplies.

A second loaded wagon was soon brought up for them, and Ami climbed up 
to take the reigns of that one as they all headed out back towards 
town. They rode on for a while quietly, until Ami finally broke the 
silence.

&quot;Do you think they&#39;ll attack us again?&quot; Ami asked Haruka worriedly.

&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Haruka said thoughtfully. &quot;Once we made the 
delivery, it became pointless. They wanted what we were hauling, not 
what we got in return.&quot;

&quot;What makes you think that?&quot; Makoto asked her pointedly.

A little smile appeared on Haruka&#39;s face as she remembered back to one 
or two instances she had been a bandit herself, &quot;If you&#39;re a criminal, 
you want to steal things that are easly stolen and then are easy for 
you to sell.&quot; Haruka smiled and shrugged before adding, &quot;Our supplies 
don&#39;t really fit either of those categories, do they.&quot;

It appeared Haruka was right, as they made a quiet trip back into 
town. The people came out like a flood, unloading the two wagons and 
passing out the supplies. Haruka climbed down first, then she helped 
Ami get Makoto down.

As soon as they saw the wound the townspeople flocked around Makoto, 
almost carrying her and Ami inside the Palace. Haruka found herself 
alone, standing by the now empty wagon. Well, almost alone, as she 
heard a delicate clearing of the throat behind her.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re all right,&quot; Michiru said gravely. Her face lit up 
with a smilke, and she wrapped her arms around Haruka&#39;s neck, pulling 
her into a kiss.

Emerald watched, and strangely a smile tugged at her lips. &#39;Well, I 
guess Sapphire failed,&#39; she thought, but she wasn&#39;t terribly bothered 
by that somehow.
