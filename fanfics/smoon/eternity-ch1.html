<h1>Eternity (part 1 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/saun.html">Saun</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The sound of booted feet echoed down the corridor as she raced through
the palace. Once in the senshi wing she turned. Her heart was
throbbing painfully in her chest. When she reached the large ornate
doors, she skidded to a stop. The suite was open, inviting visitors.
The runner slipped inside and her heart skipped a beat.

&quot;It&#39;s true then!&quot; she exclaimed in anguish. &quot;You&#39;re leaving!&quot;

Surprised, Uranus looked up from the book she was glancing through.
Then her lips quirked softly and she placed it in the box at her side.

&quot;Hai.&quot;

&quot;No! You can&#39;t go!&quot; Sailor Io hurled herself at the much older blonde,
catching Uranus around the waist.

&quot;Oi.&quot; The blonde smiled again and patted the girl on the shoulder,
allowing herself to be squeezed. There were sounds of several more
footsteps outside and then more worried faces appeared.

&quot;Is it true?&quot;

By then Io was weeping into Uranus&#39; fuku. She looked up to deliver a
choked response. &quot;They&#39;re leaving.&quot;

&quot;Ohhh.&quot; The girls sighed as one, their eyes wide.

Neptune glided gracefully out of the bedroom where she had been
packing for both of them. With concern she took in the sight of the
crying girl.

&quot;Uranus?&quot; she questioned softly.

&quot;Neptune-sama, are you really going to step down?&quot; asked Sailor Miranda.

&quot;Hai. It&#39;s time for us to go. We&#39;re not getting any younger.&quot; She
smiled sweetly at the cluster of young senshi. &quot;Won&#39;t you come in?&quot;
Hesitantly they filed in and stood at respectful attention.

Io looked up into affectionate teal eyes. &quot;Please don&#39;t go, Sempai.&quot;
She sniffled.

Uranus tapped her lightly on the forehead with her palm. &quot;Baka. We&#39;re
not dying.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; the girl answered miserably. One of the other soldiers began
to sniffle slightly and the teal-eyed senshi shot her partner a
helpless look.

&quot;We really could use your help,&quot; Neptune said, putting them to work
packing smaller items.

Uranus was relieved to be allowed to return to her own packing. She
loved the girls, but she could feel herself pulling away, getting
ready for the inevitable separation from the senshi life that had
grown familiar.

&quot;Will you miss it?&quot; Neptune asked quietly, wrapping her arms around 
Uranus. The blonde smiled and lightly shook her head; the expression 
in her catlike eyes was mellow. Over the years she had learned that 
home was wherever Neptune was. Whether they were huddled together in a 
cave, bruised and battered, or in a sumptuous palace as the diplomatic
guests to a far off solar system. As long as her lover was with her...
she was home.

There were so many senshi now, Uranus mused. It had begun with the
asteroid senshi. Then over the years as the universe had matured under
Serenity&#39;s hand of peace, more and more celestial bodies incarnated
their power. Now there were enough senshi that those who had long
served the kingdom could have a chance to enjoy all that they had
sacrificed to achieve. At one point their battle had seemed endless,
but now there was hope for a future for them... a future without
bloodshed.

&quot;Do you think we&#39;ll need storage for anything?&quot; Neptune worried.
&quot;Pluto said everything would be taken care of.&quot; Uranus turned and
tipped Neptune&#39;s chin up, wanting to look into her lovely blue eyes.
The blonde leaned closer intending to steal a quick kiss, but a crash
interrupted them.

&quot;Gomen nasai, Neptune-sama!&quot; The violinist&#39;s jewelry box lay open with
its sparkling contents scattered across the floor.

Neptune knelt and began to pick up the pieces. &quot;It&#39;s all right,
Tethys-chan,&quot; she consoled the stricken girl.

Uranus looked at the mess. &quot;Oi. I think it&#39;s almost dinner time.&quot;

The young senshi nodded and made their way slowly out the door. A few
lingered and the blonde bit back an exasperated sigh.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ll be coming to the dining hall tonight.&quot; she reassured
the girls.

Uranus then went to her partner&#39;s side and together they put the chest
back in order.


A week later, they knelt on one knee before the queen. Serenity smiled
tenderly down on their inclined heads.

&quot;Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune, I hereby release you of active
service to the crown.&quot;

Neptune reached out her gloved hand, sliding it home in her partner&#39;s.
Uranus squeezed lightly. They allowed their transformations to wear
away into simple casual wear and rose.

Michiru hugged her liege warmly. &quot;If you ever need us... you know
we&#39;ll be here.&quot; The queen pulled back and smiled.

&quot;We know.&quot;

Haruka was then pounced upon by her queen who held on so long that the
blonde was afraid she didn&#39;t intend to let go. When the elegant woman
who had once been Tsukino Usagi pulled back her eyes sparkled with
unshed tears. Haruka lightly kissed her on the forehead and looked
into her watery blue eyes. &quot;Be strong, koneko. We believe in you.&quot;

&quot;Hai,&quot; the woman answered and drew herself up. Endymion smiled at his
wife and bowed smartly to Haruka and Michiru, who returned the
acknowledgment.

Behind them, they heard a muffled sob as Saturn finally gave in to
tears. She was used to having her parents nearby. Sailor Moon had a
comforting arm wrapped around her. The pink haired senshi looked no
less distressed. The couple walked forward and in turn embraced their
daughter.

Michiru promised to write often and Haruka murmured fatherly words of
encouragement, holding the girl&#39;s shoulders.

It took a moment but Saturn drew herself up, her chin trembling
slightly. Then she dropped her head in a deep bow that she held while
several teardrops hit the marble floor, but when she came up she was
smiling.

Haruka returned the smile and gently brought the girl&#39;s chin up. Her
violet eyes shone. This girl had taught them so much about faith
Haruka mused. Their child had believed in Sailor Moon during even the
darkest hours, as had Haruka herself, but to have this little beacon
in their life had helped reaffirm the other Outer senshi&#39;s own belief.

&quot;No more tears. You&#39;ve cried enough this week.&quot; She knew Hotaru had a
tender heart.

&quot;But you&#39;re leaving.&quot; Hotaru&#39;s voice was a little shaky.

&quot;We&#39;ll be back.&quot; Michiru whispered. &quot;We&#39;ll definitely be back to
visit.&quot; She winked.

Michiru tucked her arm into the crook of Haruka&#39;s elbow. Several rows
of sailor suited young women waved to them as they started to make
their way out of the palace.

&quot;Wait! Ura...Haruka-san, Michiru-san!&quot; The queen&#39;s voice suddenly
sounded much younger as she repeated the long unused names of her
friends. &quot;We have a gift for you.&quot; A page quickly darted forward with
a velvet cushion. Neo Queen Serenity picked up two sets of keys and
bestowed a set to each woman.

Haruka flushed a bit. &quot;You don&#39;t have to give us anything.&quot;

&quot;I know, but I wanted to.&quot;

They looked at the queen&#39;s face and into Usagi-chan&#39;s warm blue eyes.
Together they bowed.

Outside, they saw an exact replica of Haruka&#39;s trademark yellow Toyota.
The blonde&#39;s face lit in a smile and testing her intuition she slid
the key home into the lock.

Michiru turned sensing something in the breeze. Setsuna was behind
them with a mysterious smile of her face, her dark green hair fanning
out behind her in the wind.

&quot;Pluto,&quot; she acknowledged with a smile.

&quot;No need to be so formal.&quot;

They were glad to see her. When they had established Crystal Tokyo,
Pluto had returned to the time gate and in going about their regular
duties their paths rarely crossed.

&quot;I came to give you this.&quot; The senshi of time offered a piece of
parchment paper. &quot;Directions to your new accommodations.&quot;

&quot;Nothing like waiting until the last minute,&quot; Haruka teased, while
looking on curiously as Michiru unfolded the map.

&quot;Timing is everything,&quot; Setsuna quipped, with a small smile on her
face. She bowed politely and turned to go, but Michiru caught her hand
and in seconds they were embracing.

&quot;I&#39;m going to miss you.&quot; The violinist&#39;s voice was choked with
emotion. When she pulled back tears sparked in her eyes. Setsuna was
sniffling also. It had been years since they&#39;d lived together but the
bonds were still strong. Haruka embraced her friend.

&quot;Take care,&quot; she whispered, her voice lower than usual.

Garnet eyes twinkled as the time guardian forced a wavering smile.
&quot;I&#39;ll see you soon.&quot;

The blonde slid behind the wheel and she couldn&#39;t suppress a thrill of
excitement as the engine roared to life.

They pulled away and Michiru waved to Setsuna until the other woman
disappeared from sight.

Michiru was delicately blotting at her pinkened nose and the blonde
drove in silence. She followed the direction to the edge of Crystal
Tokyo&#39;s suburbs, almost to the coastline. From there she turned down a
shady lane full of large old trees that cast a shade over the road.

&quot;What&#39;s the house number?&quot; Michiru asked after she had disposed of her
tissue. They passed several large homes before coming to the end of
the street. Haruka maneuvered the new car down a side road and they
came into a clearing where stood a large white house. Through the
parted trees you could just glimpse the inviting blue of the sea.

&quot;Oh.&quot; Michiru gasped her hands flying to her mouth as tears again
sparked in her eyes.

It was an exact replica of the house on the tiny stained piece of
paper the violinist had kept for years before it had finally been
destroyed.

When Haruka glanced at her lover she found Michiru smiling brightly
like a woman much younger. They both recognized the queen&#39;s hand in
this gift.

&quot;Tadaima,&quot; Haruka said in a low voice.

&quot;Finally.&quot; Michiru breathed a sigh of happiness.

There was a card on the kitchen table and Michiru&#39;s eyes filled anew
with tears when she read it. She pulled out another tissue and pressed
her fingers to the corners of her eyes trying to stop her tears.

&quot;My mascara.&quot; The cosmetics queen mourned.

Haruka&#39;s eyes were warm. &quot;Too late. You already look like a
panda,&quot; she teased.

Michiru handed over the tender note from their queen and suddenly it
was the blonde who was having trouble swallowing the sudden knot in
her throat.

They inspected their new home. All of their clothes had been unpacked
and hung neatly in the closet while their more personal items still
remained undisturbed in their suitcases. Together they set about
putting their house in order. The weeks that followed were full of
unpacking and long hours of arranging before Michiru finally had
things the way she wanted them.



It was a bright morning a few months later when, Haruka slipped out
of bed and went into her closet. With sure movements she took out the
small box adorned with the royal jeweler&#39;s crest. Popping it open she
removed something and returned to the bed, crouching beside Michiru&#39;s
sleeping form. She had thought long and hard about how to do this.
Should she make a big production? If she suggested a fancy dinner in
town that would only alert her intuitive mate that something was afoot.

Michiru&#39;s hair was draped across the pillow showing her slender neck
and the curve of her collarbone. Unable to resist the urge the blonde
lightly kissed her lover&#39;s temple. Michiru&#39;s hand lay curled beside
her on the pillow and Haruka took it in her own and for a moment their
fingers laced before Haruka made a deft movement. Michiru lightly
squeezed in her sleep. Haruka pulled the hand up and planted a soft
kiss on her love&#39;s palm before retreating downstairs.

Haruka padded to the kitchen and made coffee. She thought about having
some but decided that her stomach didn&#39;t need the extra acid. She had
been all right, but now the waiting that was killing her. Hearing the
faint sounds of Michiru stirring, she rose to take a mug from the
cupboard and prepare the coffee the way she knew Michiru liked it.

What would Michiru think? That it was unnecessary? It was, but then
again... The thought of proclaiming her love in front of a room full
of people was enough to make Haruka flush and her heart throb in her
chest. Confessing wasn&#39;t any easier for her now than it had been
millennia ago. However, when she examined the years that had passed
she felt that it was due time to properly marry the one who held her
heart.  But did Michiru feel the same?

Her face showed no signs of her inner turmoil as she stirred in a
little cream.

Michiru awoke with a sigh. Her head was pillowed on her arm and she
was facing the window. Sunlight streamed through and made a little
pattern on the thick cream carpet. The violinist stretched and pulled
the cover over her cool shoulder. Thus snuggled she thought about the
coming day. She needed to practice her violin and do a little
shopping. Perhaps she could have lunch at her favorite little cafe
downtown. She thought there were some new neighbors moving in down the
lane that led to their secluded new home. She definitely wanted to
take a gift and say hello. She wondered what Haruka had planned.
Feeling warm inside from more than just the blanket she slid her feet
out from under the coverlet and perched on the edge of the bed until
she could pull on her robe. Haruka was already up and gone - probably
for her morning jog. They really had settled into a nice routine here
she thought with a smile.

The artist went into the bathroom and was shaking out her sleep
tousled curls when a flash in the mirror caught her attention. Michiru
leaned forward looking in the glass when she realized the shimmer came
from her left hand. She glanced down at the glittering ring on her
finger. Shocked, for a moment all she could do was stare. It was
absolutely beautiful. The deep blue green of the aquamarine was offset
by the gleam of the embracing platinum band. A wash of emotion flooded
Michiru&#39;s chest and she brought the ring to her mouth and lightly
pressed her lips to the stone.

&quot;Haruka,&quot; she whispered.

She wondered why her lover had given her a gift like this. It wasn&#39;t
their anniversary or her birthday. Her stomach fluttered as she again
looked at the ring.

&quot;Like an excited child,&quot; she said somewhat chidingly to her
reflection, before pulling her hair up into a loose knot.

She caught the smell of freshly brewed coffee and her stomach murmured
its hunger. Michiru swept out of the bathroom and down the steps.
Haruka was at the breakfast table with her back to the violinist.

Michiru wrapped her arms around the blonde from behind and kissed just
behind her ear.

&quot;Thank you. It&#39;s beautiful.&quot; she murmured.

Haruka gave a sigh of relief. &quot;You like it.&quot;

Michiru gave a warm giggle. &quot;Hai. It&#39;s so beautiful.&quot; she lifted her
slender hand and she and Haruka stared together at the winking stone.
The odd placement again struck Michiru and she pulled away still
contemplating her hand.

&quot;Like an engagement ring,&quot; Michiru said with a small smile as she made
her way toward the coffeepot. Haruka&#39;s eyes were innocent as she
intercepted her lover with a cup.

&quot;Hai. Like an engagement ring.&quot;

Michiru&#39;s eyes met Haruka&#39;s now serious ones and she paused mid-sip,
her eyes widening.

She set the mug on the drain board and cupped Haruka&#39;s face kissing
the blonde&#39;s lips once then again and again. Haruka came up for air
after a particularly intense kiss.

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; This was punctuated with more sweet kisses.

Sailor Saturn trudged back to her quarters. She was sweaty and tired
from glaive practice. Now even if she couldn&#39;t throw an energy based
attack, she was a lethal force in battle. That was one thing Haruka
had taught her: always be prepared. Back in the confines of her room
she let her transformation wear off and the glaive vanished to wait in
razor sharp readiness until she called for it. Hotaru had started her
shower and went back to pick a change of clothes when she noticed the
vellum envelope. Immediately she recognized Michiru&#39;s elegant script.
Excited she tore it open to reveal a letter from her parents. Three
pages were full of maternal care.

&quot;Don&#39;t forget to eat. Are you taking your calcium supplements?&quot;
A fourth page in neat precise handwriting was full of some light
teasing and more practical worries.

&quot;Are you training hard enough? Remember not to lose your edge.&quot;
She laughed reading Haruka&#39;s concern for her safety behind the abrupt
warnings. Yes, these were her parents - two of them anyway. Michiru
told her about the new house and had included a pressed flower to show
her how beautiful the garden was. The best parts were the small
illustrations around the edges of a tiny scowling Haruka-papa doing
the bidding of a happily smiling Michiru-mama. After drinking in every
word, she realized that she&#39;d been wasting water. With a last glance
she rose and a small card fluttered from her hand and landed on the
floor. Hotaru stooped and picked it up.

&quot;Save the date,&quot; she read. Her violet eyes widened with surprise and
joy. There was a phone number on the back and she threw herself across
the bed and grabbed her hand set. Fingers flying she managed to dial
the right number.

&quot;Moshi moshi.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re getting married!&quot; Hotaru breathlessly exclaimed.

Michiru&#39;s laughter carried across the line.
&quot;Are you surprised?&quot;

The younger woman thought about some of the tender expressions she&#39;d
seen Haruka send Michiru&#39;s direction when the other woman wasn&#39;t
looking. &quot;Not really.&quot; She answered truthfully.

&quot;No?&quot; Michiru&#39;s voice dropped conspiratorially. &quot;Well I am!&quot;

They laughed together.

&quot;Have you told Setsuna-mama yet?&quot; Hotaru grimaced as she realized
how easily the old moniker slipped off her tongue.

Michiru ignored it - if she had noticed at all. &quot;She probably already
knows.&quot; The violist wryly observed.

&quot;Hai.&quot; Hotaru agreed. It was hard to get anything over on Pluto these
days. A sudden rush of happiness for her two parents overcame her.

&quot;Congratulations!&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;I bet you have everything already planned out.&quot; Hotaru teased.

&quot;Well not yet. I was waiting for the bridesmaid&#39;s luncheon to finalize
all of the details,&quot; the violinist shared.

&quot;Oh.&quot; Hotaru&#39;s curiosity got the better of her. &quot;When is that?&quot;

&quot;Whenever you and Setsuna can find time for one!&quot;

&quot;I get to be a bridesmaid?&quot;

&quot;Of course, silly, who else would I ask?&quot;

&quot;I get to be bridesmaid!&quot;

Michiru promised to call as soon as she had spoken with Pluto. Hotaru
hung up feeling elated and then with chagrin she realized the water
was still running in the bathroom. Throwing off her clothes she raced
to finish her shower because as soon as she was done she was going
to find Chibi-Usa and tell her best friend just what her adoptive
parents were up to now.

Author&#39;s Notes: Ok, yes, I have covered this material before. But
I write in a  multiverse due to some Star Trek influence.Infinite
Possibilities in Infinite Combinations. Yes, I am a geek and proud of
it ^_~

I have gotten them engaged before, However, the myu and time have made
me re-think some things. While I like Unity and feel I did the anime
justice, I now want to play with the manga and the Myu tempered by the
anime... perhaps a *tiny* dash of PGSM for Makoto. I really think this
story turned out well. H&amp;M are more firmly fleshed out in my mind.

Also it is almost my birthday (9 more days!!)and this year I mentioned
in passing to my editor that I really love reviews and
that I hoped I&#39;d get some on this fic. So out of love
*coughcoughpowertripcoughcough* she has decided
not to give me new chapters to post until I get several reviews on the
most recent.
Which is sweet and funny.. .but I want to post the whole thing @_@
So please please help me ransom the fic by reviewing.

The other things I want for my birthday: an insulated coffee mug,
a sweat shirt, book store gift cards...Nao-san &not;.&not;

Tethys, Io and Miranda are moons of Saturn, Jupiter, and Uranus
respectively.</pre>
