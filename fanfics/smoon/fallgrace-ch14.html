<h1>Fallen from Grace (part 14 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blue.html">BluestAngelDust</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/fallgrace-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>The door to the apartment opened. She stiffened immediately, her blood 
running cold in her veins. There was no delicious aroma... no warmth. 
Only darkness.

The fear and panic she felt was different from that of battle. Those 
feelings stemmed from physical danger. This was... far worse.

&quot;Hotaru?&quot;

When she was met with silence, Rei broke into a run, searching the 
apartment. Burning eyes peered into every room, checking and rechecking. 
Still, no signs of the girl. A shaky hand found its way to a messy mane 
of raven locks as the miko chewed on her bottom lip. Damn it, where the 
hell was she? Did she leave?

At the thought, a new wave of panic struck her. No, no. Hotaru would 
never leave her.

&#39;Are you so numb that you don&#39;t even realize her love for you?&#39;

Rei collapsed in a heap on the couch. Did Hotaru think the same as 
Utena? That she doesn&#39;t know?

She did. Not always, but after a while, she figured it out. Everyone&#39;s 
been dropping her hints, from Makoto to Setsuna. No, she wasn&#39;t that 
numb.

At first Rei thought it was a silly, school girl crush, though Hotaru 
was by no means a silly school girl. She was very flattered, to be 
honest. She could remember the exact moment she figured it out.

It was after that dinner from hell. She was sitting on her bed, staring 
at the wall while replaying the whole conversation with Minako in her 
head. She remembered the fire in Hotaru&#39;s eyes when the college student 
yelled at her for degrading herself. How could she forget the hate and 
contempt in those violet eyes as they gazed at Minako? And the way 
Hotaru held her, as if she&#39;d break if she tightened her hold. And the 
love, falling into an ocean of unconditional love every time Hotaru 
looked at her.

She was numb, but not that numb.

And Rei went out immediately after that and got laid. Great, just... 
great.

She couldn&#39;t handle the knowledge she gained. It needed to be forgotten, 
drowned out by mindless pleasure. Love brought pain and confusion, 
emotions that has surrounded her for many years.

And the other night, after her realization... when they were in the 
kitchen. The kiss that, once again, almost happened. What scared her was 
how much she wanted to kiss Hotaru. It wasn&#39;t t like this the first 
time. The first time, she realized Hotaru deserved more than a one night 
stand. She deserved a person who loved her, who would take care of her. 
But she still lusted for her, pure lust.

The second time, she knew Hotaru loved her. If she kissed her, she would 
break the girl&#39;s heart. It wasn&#39;t just a kiss or sex with the college 
student. It was about what the girl deserved and what she could give.

And what she could give was far less than what her friend deserved.

There was also more than lust. It was... a want and not a need. Rei 
wanted Hotaru, wanted to kiss her and hold her. And not just for one 
night. It was... for eternity.

It was the same feeling she got when she realized Usagi was truly her 
friend. It was the same feeling she experienced when Minako first told 
her to give the blonde a chance.

It was the same feeling when Rei realized she loved Usagi. And it was 
the same feeling she had when she gave Minako that chance... and fell in 
love.

So, did this mean what she thinks it means?

Is that why the thought that Hotaru left without saying goodbye hurt 
almost as much as Usagi&#39;s rejection? Why her heart feels like it&#39;s 
breaking the same way it did when Minako broke up with her?

&quot;Rei?&quot;

Her head snapped up at the sound of her name. Her eyes found the figure 
who said her name. It was her. And the miko felt true joy for the first 
time in years.

&quot;H-Hotaru?&quot;

She almost winced at how hoarse her voice sounded. The college student 
approached her, taking in the miko&#39;s defeated and crushed appearance. 
Her business suit was wrinkled, her hair a mess and her eyes hesitant.

&quot;What are you doing in the dark?&quot;

Hotaru found herself pulled to a warm body, slender arms wrapped tightly 
around her. She opened her mouth to speak, but was cut off by a 
quivering voice.

&quot;I-I thought you left... without saying anything.&quot;

The shorter girl blinked, Rei&#39;s fear-filled voice reaching her ears. She 
smiled sadly in response, arms reaching out to embrace the miko. One 
hand found its way into the mane of long hair.

&quot;It&#39;s all right. I&#39;m right here.&quot;

Rei&#39;s arms tightened around her friend&#39;s body, eyes closing. A tear made 
its way down her cheeks. She didn&#39;t leave. She stayed.

She stayed.

Hotaru just held Rei, the barely there smile still on her face. The miko 
wanted her to stay, needed her to stay. The emotions she felt were 
indescribable. She was needed.

She felt Rei bury her face into her shoulder and her own eyes began to 
tear up.

She was needed, here... now. By the woman she loved.

She&#39;d never tell Rei she did leave. All that matters is that she came 
back. And she was here.

She was here.

Rei opened her eyes, taking a deep breath. She felt so alive, so 
energized. The sun poured in through the open windows, the morning 
breeze waking her.

&quot;It&#39;s so early.&quot;

Her eyes softened when they fell on the body snuggling against her, the 
same one that had mumbled. A smile touched her lips before she shifted 
slightly to block the sun for Hotaru.

After a while of holding each other last night, they both laid down on 
the couch. Hotaru held her the entire night and fell asleep sometime at 
five in the morning. She, however, stayed up a while longer to watch 
Hotaru sleep.

She loved the feeling of the younger girl&#39;s arms around her and her own 
around the petite body. They molded together perfectly, just as she and 
Minako had.

The miko watched Hotaru, just like she was doing now. The way the girl 
pouted slightly in her sleep was adorable. The way her long lashes 
brushed against her pale cheeks was mesmerizing. The way she looked, so 
peaceful, was utterly beautiful.

Rei buried her face in Hotaru&#39;s hair for a split second. As always, the 
smell of vanilla and cherries invaded her senses.

She cared for Hotaru, obviously. But was it love?

&quot;Rei?&quot;

The miko&#39;s attention turned to the body beside her. Hotaru&#39;s eyes opened 
sleepily to see Rei&#39;s smiling face. The sight made her smile in return. 
It was a sight to behold- one she wished could be the first thing she 
saw everyday for the rest of her life.

&quot;Morning. Sleep well?&quot;

A yawn was the only response the miko got. Her smile grew.

&quot;Go back to sleep.&quot;

Hotaru didn&#39;t need to be told twice and fell back to sleep instantly. 
Her friend&#39;s smile became a goofy and very large grin.

&quot;Sleep tight.&quot;

Detaching herself from the younger girl&#39;s arms was harder than she&#39;d 
thought. And to let go of the petite body was even harder. But at last, 
Rei managed to get off the couch with one last, affectionate look at the 
girl. With a sigh, her lean form disappeared into the bathroom.

Hotaru blinked lazily, trying to get rid of the last remnants of sleep. 
The first thing she noticed was Rei was no where to be seen. She sat up 
and looked around, hearing music coming from the study.

Pausing by the doorway, Hotaru was greeted by the same sight as two 
nights ago. The businesswoman sat behind her desk, long hair in a messy 
bun while a pair of black rimmed glasses perched on her nose.

&quot;Hey.&quot;

The businesswoman looked up at the sound of the sleep-filled drawl.

&quot;Hey yourself.&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t you going to be late for work?&quot;

Rei looked amused as she leaned back in her chair.

&quot;It&#39;s past noon, so yes, I&#39;m be late for work.&quot;

Violet eyes widened in surprise. Past noon? She slept for that long? A 
blush darkened her pale cheeks.

&quot;Then what are you doing home?&quot;

Rei stood, walking over to her guest. The smile on her lips reached her 
eyes, the sight making the short college student&#39;s heart hammer in her 
chest. She barely managed to speak.

&quot;W-well?&quot;

The miko ignored the flutter in her chest when Hotaru said &#39;home.&#39; It 
was uncalled for since this was her home, but just maybe her guest meant 
it was her own home as well.

&quot;Well,&quot; the taller woman started in a low whisper, &quot;you&#39;ve been here for 
over a week and we haven&#39;t done much. What with me being sick and then 
work. So, I took the day off.&quot;

&quot;Y-you what?&quot;

The low and sensual laugh echoed in the room at the incredulous look on 
the younger girl&#39;s face.

&quot;I took the day off.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

Hotaru stared at her friend in disbelief. This earned a sigh from the 
other woman, who wore an expression of mock-disappointment.

&quot;If you don&#39;t want me to, I&#39;ll-&quot;

&quot;No! That&#39;s not what I meant at all! I&#39;m just surprised.&quot;

Rei smiled and tapped Hotaru&#39;s nose with a finger. &quot;Good. Why don&#39;t you 
find something to eat while I finish these reports? Then we&#39;ll go the 
Laundromat. I&#39;m sure you have clothes to wash too.&quot;

Hotaru nodded and all but skipped out of Rei&#39;s office. The miko sat back 
down at her desk. Was she supposed to get a warm feeling when she was 
going to do laundry?

Rei smiled at the doorman as she and Hotaru walked out of the apartment 
building, a large laundry bag on her back. Usually, most of her clothes 
would be dry-clean only, but since she hasn&#39;t been to work that often, 
there wasn&#39;t that much. Whatever dry cleaning there was, Hotaru was 
carrying.

&quot;You sure you don&#39;t want me to hold it?&quot;

&quot;Hotaru, this bag is as tall as you are.&quot;

Hotaru glared at her friend, but remained quiet. Whether Rei knew it or 
not, they were going to clean up that huge and very messy apartment.

It was adoring to see the miko in a pair of gray sweats and a simple, 
white T-shirt. No black, red, tight clothing or anything that showed a 
great amount of cleavage.

Actually, she was even more beautiful like this. Completely relaxed, the 
long mane was pulled back in a high ponytail. Lavender eyes were 
completely unguarded, the smug smirk replaced by a small smile.

&quot;So, how often do you do laundry?&quot;

Rei looked over at the girl walking beside her. Hotaru was looking at 
her with a curious but very motherly expression. She sighed inwardly. 
The girl was a damn neat freak while she, well, wasn&#39;t.

&quot;Once or twice a month.&quot;

Hotaru&#39;s jaw dropped at the answer. Rei continued, not wanting to be 
scolded.

&quot;Most of my work or clubbing clothes are dry-clean only. I rarely wear 
anything but one of those two, so there isn&#39;t that much laundry to do. I 
drop of my dry-cleaning every few days.&quot;

The younger woman seemed to accept this answer, much to the poor miko&#39;s 
relief.

The two stepped into the large Laundromat and first dropped off the 
dry-cleaning. The woman behind the counter seemed surprised Rei wasn&#39;t 
leaving the rest of her laundry, though she had enough time to stare at 
Hotaru approvingly.

The two senshi looked around the empty place. With a shrug, Rei set down 
the large bag and opened the door to three machines. Without a thought, 
she started throwing things in.

&quot;Rei!&quot;

The miko looked up to see Hotaru scowling at her. Lavender eyes blinked, 
confused.

&quot;Don&#39;t you separate your colors?&quot;

Hotaru watched as Rei stared at her with a cute, puzzled look on her 
face. The college student groaned and shook her head.

&quot;Light colors, dark colors and jeans?&quot;

Rei straightened as her houseguest set to work, separating the loads and 
throwing them into the appropriate machine.

&quot;You know, most people just do light and dark.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but you have three machines and a lot of clothes.&quot;

The taller woman shook her head in disbelief at Hotaru&#39;s level of 
neatness. The other girl only glared.

&quot;Make yourself useful and get the detergent!&quot;

&quot;Yes, master,&quot; Rei answer, doing an Igor impression by dragging one leg 
behind her and making one eye smaller than the other.

Hotaru growled and threw a white shirt at the woman mocking her. The 
miko grabbed it off her face and tossed it into a machine... the one for 
dark colors.

&quot;REI!&quot;

The two sat in the plastic chairs, watching the machines spin the 
clothes around and around. Hotaru sipped her soda.

&quot;Waiting is so much fun.&quot;

The miko rolled her eyes at the comment and took a bite of her ice cream 
sandwich.

&quot;Want to play video games?&quot;

Hotaru looked over as a mischievous smile formed on her lips.

&quot;Thought you&#39;d never ask.&quot;

Rei rolled her eyes again as they headed for the machines. One of them 
caught their attention at the same time. Sharing a look, they approached 
the game, inserting two coins each into the slots. It only took them 
seconds to select their characters. Next thing they knew...

Sailor Saturn and Sailor Mars stared at each other in font of a forest 
backdrop.

&quot;Oh... my... god...&quot;

Hotaru blushed at the comment from Rei, who was openly gawking at Sailor 
Saturn on the screen. The creators had gotten Mars right, but Saturn?

For one, Saturn did NOT have the measurements: 42&quot;, 26&quot;, 42&quot;.

Also, she did NOT wear purple short shorts.

And she most definitely didn&#39;t have a plunging neckline as part of her 
fuku.

&quot;Guys made this.&quot;

The comment caused Hotaru to blush even more. All right, they went way 
too overboard.

&quot;Mars isn&#39;t exactly flat-chested either.&quot;

Rei just gave her that cocky smile. &quot;At least she&#39;s around a 38&quot; and not 
a 46&quot; like Saturn!&quot;

&quot;Hino!&quot;

The miko laughed, the indignant and embarrassed expression on Hotaru&#39;s 
face too cute to resist.

&quot;All right, I&#39;m sorry. Let&#39;s just fight.&quot;

And fight they did. Hotaru started laughing when Mar&#39;s kick was 
basically a split in midair. And after that attack, &#39;Mars&#39; paused and 
fanned herself, giving the players a wink.

&quot;I do NOT do that!&quot;

Hotaru smirked, revenge was fun. But the smirk faded when one of 
Saturn&#39;s attacks involved the already tight outfit to rip in several 
places. Rei snickered, but said nothing.

&quot;I&#39;m going to cream you,&quot; the college student mumbled.

The miko didn&#39;t reply, but grinned when she reached the MAX on her power 
bar. Mars unleashed her most powerful attack and... Rei gawked.

Wind surrounded the miko&#39;s alter-ego, causing her skirt to blow upwards, 
revealing a red thong. Hotaru was laughing hysterically, until Mars 
grabbed Saturn and kissed her.

Two pairs of purple eyes stared at the screen, shocked to say the least. 
After the light died down, Mars stood triumphantly over Saturn&#39;s prone 
body.

Neither could look at each other after that very... interesting attack.

&#39;Why am I blushing?&#39;they both thought to themselves.

Rei licked her lips. The move only reminded her of the times she could 
have kissed Hotaru, but didn&#39;t. Damn, where was the urge coming from 
now?

&#39;Well,&#39;Hotaru thought bitterly, &#39;if you can&#39;t kiss her in real life, 
video games come close.&#39;

She couldn&#39;t deny she wanted to kiss Rei, never could actually. But the 
desire was becoming harder to ignore as each day passed. They were so 
close yet light years apart from each other. To be honest, she envied 
her video game counterpart.

&quot;Interesting attack, eh?&quot;

Both snapped out of their thoughts to look at the woman behind the 
counter. It was then Hotaru noticed that she was not much older than 
herself. The teller jumped over the counter and approached them.

&quot;Err... yeah,&quot; Rei forced out finally.

&quot;I take it you two aren&#39;t very open to the idea of homosexuality.&quot;

&quot;No, we&#39;re not,&quot; Hotaru said quickly. Realizing her mistake, the college 
student smacked her forehead with her hand. &quot;I mean, no, we&#39;re not not 
open. I mean-&quot;

Seeing the guilty expression on Hotaru&#39;s face, the young woman laughed.

&quot;It&#39;s fine if you&#39;re not.&quot;

The miko could see how flustered Hotaru was getting. Wait, Hotaru&#39;s 
never nervous. So did this mean she liked the blonde woman before them?

A jealous flame engulfed Rei&#39;s heart for a split second. Wait, why was 
she jealous?

&quot;She&#39;s just flustered,&quot; the miko offered, staring the blonde down. 
&quot;We&#39;re perfectly fine with it. Most, actually, all of our close friends 
except one are lesbians.&quot;

Hotaru arched a brow at Rei in question. The miko blushed, understanding 
her friend&#39;s gaze.

&quot;We both know far too much to think I&#39;m straight.&quot;

The college student only smirked, causing Rei&#39;s blush to darken.

&quot;Hey, you&#39;re the one raised b the cutest lesbian couple in the world and 
the woman that&#39;s dating my ex-girlfriend.&quot;

It was the younger girl&#39;s turn to darken and darken she did. The teller 
watched the exchange with interest.

&quot;How rude of me, I&#39;m Yumi Ono.&quot;

Rei took the offered hand, her grip strong.

&quot;Rei Hino. And my blushing friend is Hotaru Tomoe.&quot;

Much to the women&#39;s amusement, the college student&#39;s blush darkened.

&quot;I&#39;m a big girl now, Rei-san,&quot; Hotaru said instead, clearing her throat. 
&quot;I can introduce myself, you know.&quot;

The miko blinked several times as Hotaru shook hands with Yumi.

&quot;Did you just call me -san?&quot;

The shorter girl just smirked smugly.

&quot;Yes, I did.&quot;

Rei wiped an imaginary tear from her eye.

&quot;I thought we were beyond that, Hotaru-chan.&quot;

Violet eyes were rolled upwards as the pale girl gave her friend a 
playful shove. The businesswoman beamed, causing Hotaru&#39;s glare to 
worsen.

&quot;So, what did you two think of the attack Mars used?&quot;

At Yumi&#39;s question, Rei blushed, much to the Laundromat worker&#39;s 
confusion. Hotaru fought the urge to blush herself and took this chance 
to embarrass her host.

&quot;I thought Venus was the senshi of Love and Beauty.&quot;

&quot;Oh, she is,&quot; Yumi answered without missing a beat. &quot;But the creators of 
the game were Saturn/Mars fans.&quot;

Rei&#39;s lavender eyes blinked in confusion. Hotaru, however, seemed to 
understand perfectly.

&quot;Sailor Saturn and Sailor Mars coupling fan,&quot; Yumi explained to the 
confused miko, which didn&#39;t seem to help any. &quot;Coupling as in fan 
fiction.&quot;

More blinked. Hotaru gave Rei a pat on the head, causing the miko&#39;s 
confused gaze to her.

&quot;Forgive her,&quot; the college student said to Yumi, stroking her friend&#39;s 
hair since the taller girl was now sitting. &quot;She works lot and doesn&#39;t 
get out much.&quot;

&quot;I play too!&quot; Rei mumbled under her breath. Hotaru missed the comment, 
but Yumi didn&#39;t. She only smiled.

&quot;It&#39;s all right. Fanfiction is, just as the name suggests, fiction 
written by fans. Even though no one knows a lot about the senshi, 
they&#39;re very popular as fanfic characters. There are your straight 
couples, and then there are the &#39;shoujo-ai&#39; couples.&quot;

Rei nodded, slowly grasping it. Yeah, she&#39;d read Card Captor Sakura fics 
(Tomoyo is just too damn cute for her not to), Gundam Wing (Noin and Une 
were just plain hot) and InuYasha (okay, so Sesshoumaru and Kagome is a 
straight couple but what the hell!). Never did she imagine the senshi 
being written about! The thought alone caused her to blush. People 
writing, using her. Well, not her, Mars.

&quot;There are a lot of couples for &#39;shoujo-ai.&#39;&quot;

The comment was almost enough to send Rei flying to the door. A lot of 
couples? Damn, she was getting interested.

&quot;There&#39;s Uranus and Neptune, they&#39;re one of the hottest couples.&quot;

Good to know that even in the world of fandom Haruka and Michiru are 
together. They deserved it.

&quot;Mercury and Jupiter is also a very popular couple.&quot;

Rei&#39;s blush faded when a grin touched her lips. The memory of disturbing 
Makoto and Ami resurfaced. Ah, those two.

&quot;Mars and Moon.&quot;

Lavender eyes widened as the miko froze. Mars and Moon. She and... 
Usagi? A-a couple?

Hotaru noticed the dark look passing over her friend&#39;s face. Desperate, 
she scratched Rei&#39;s head, right above her right ear. The action seemed 
to shock the miko back to reality. When she looked up in surprise, the 
college student only smiled, blushing slightly.

&quot;Well, Mars floats around the most, to be honest. Sure, there&#39;s a few 
Uranus and Moon fics out there.&quot;

A shiver went down Rei&#39;s spine at the new information. The Princess of 
Wind and of Light?

Hotaru once again noticed how Rei trembled. This time, she paused her 
stroking of the long mane. The miko looked up as Yumi continued.

&quot;Neptune and Pluto-&quot;

Wow, so many couples she never would&#39;ve thought of. Well, Setsuna and 
Michiru did go well together. No, don&#39;t think like that.

&quot;And basically anyone and Moon.&quot;

Well, they all loved their Princess. It&#39;s not surprising people think it 
actually was that way.

&quot;What about Saturn? Does she ever get paired up with Moon?&quot;

The stiffening of Hotaru&#39;s body was ignored by her friend and host. Her 
and Usagi-hime... whoa.

&quot;I don&#39;t think so...&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot;

Rei felt the college student&#39;s confused gaze on her. To be honest, she 
didn&#39;t know why she said &#39;good&#39; either. But she knew it wasn&#39;t because 
she didn&#39;t want Usagi with anyone else.

&quot;There&#39;s Saturn and Pluto.&quot;

The businesswoman lost her cool and almost fell off the chair. Saturn 
and Pluto?

An image of Setsuna and Hotaru kissing flashed in her mind. Her fists 
clenched. Why did they actually look good together?

Damn Setsuna. Damn her. She got Minako-

&quot;And Pluto and Venus coupling is very popular.&quot;

Rei squeezed her eyes shut as Hotaru pulled her back into her seat. Even 
in the fanfic world, Setsuna gets Minako. And Hotaru too. How was this 
fair?

&quot;There&#39;s Pluto and Mars, on occasion.&quot;

Oh, just her luck. She also ends up with the woman she hated with a 
passion right now.

&quot;Can&#39;t forget Jupiter and Venus.&quot;

Oh, hell with it. Basically, everyone could get together with anyone. If 
you think about it, that&#39;s 72 possible pairings.

&quot;Mars and Mercy, Mars and Venus.&quot;

Wait, back up. Mars and Mercury? Rei shuddered again. That was not 
right, at least in her opinion. She&#39;s never even looked twice at Ami in 
that way. Not that there was anything wrong with the girl. Actually, she 
was quite pretty and very smart. Intelligence was a very big turn on-

Did she say Mars and Venus? So, there&#39;s one place where they&#39;ll be 
together.

Hotaru grew nervous when Rei sat completely still. Not stiff, just 
still. She couldn&#39;t say anything in front of Yumi. So, she just buried 
her fingers in the raven mane. The touch seemed enough to get the miko 
back.

&quot;Wow.&quot;

Okay, that was not what she expected her friend to say. Wow? She finds 
out her alter ego is paired with her love&#39;s alter ego and all she have 
to say is &#39;wow&#39;?

&quot;Cool, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Rei smiled, one Hotaru couldn&#39;t tell whether it was fake or real. 
Though, it shouldn&#39;t be real.

&quot;It&#39;s something.&quot;

The miko was taking this well. Too well. Hotaru placed a hand on her 
friend&#39;s shoulder. The businesswoman looked at her and smiled. Then, she 
placed her hand over Hotaru&#39;s.

Yumi watched with both amusement and interest. Were these two blind or 
stupid? They didn&#39;t seem to be the latter, though they weren&#39;t together 
yet. So maybe it was the latter.

&quot;I should go, nice talking to you two.&quot;

Yumi smiled as the two bid her farewell. She&#39;d give them a week max to 
get together.

Hotaru stared at the large bag of clean laundry as Rei continued to 
stuff clothes in from the machines. Two hours. Two whole hours with the 
miko after that very interesting conversation. Can any say, &#39;awkward 
silence&#39;?

&quot;Well, what&#39;s the last of it,&quot; Rei announced with a relieved sigh

&quot;Thank god.&quot;

The miko chuckled and threw the bag over her shoulder. Wordlessly, the 
two walked out, still feeling as uncomfortable as can be.

At the apartment, Rei emptied the bag on her bed and sighed. So much 
laundry to fold.

&quot;Need a hand?&quot;

Rei looked over to Hotaru, who stood in the doorway and smiled.

&quot;Sure, come on in.&quot;

The college student walked over and the two started to fold the endless 
sea of clothes.

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Hotaru said, holding up a pink, lacy bra.

&quot;Hey! Gimme that!&quot;

The blush on the miko&#39;s cheeks was enough to cause Hotaru to laugh.

&quot;What time is it?&quot;

&quot;Four thirty,&quot; Hotaru answered, setting one of her own shirts aside.

&quot;We&#39;ve leaving in two hours.&quot;

&quot;What? Where to?&quot;

Rei smiled at the confused and annoyed expression on Hotaru&#39;s face.

&quot;We&#39;re going to watch a performance.&quot;

&quot;What? When did this happen?&quot;

&quot;This morning while you were still sleeping.&quot;

Hotaru blushed at the reminder of being asleep for so long. And... she 
was going out with Rei. It wasn&#39;t a big deal. And the last time they 
went out, it ended in disaster. But this time... it would be different. 
It would be her and Rei, at a performance, by themselves. Okay, by 
themselves in a crowd of people but that&#39;s beside the point.

&quot;Do I have to dress up?&#39;

&quot;Nope. I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d like the whole &#39;be a vision of perfection&#39; 
thing. It&#39;s outdoors in a nice field with a stage built especially for 
this.&quot;

At the news, Hotaru felt like she could kiss Rei. Well, she always felt 
like she could kiss her friend but this time, it was out of 
appreciation. She always felt so out of place at formal events, even if 
it was one of Michi-mama&#39;s performances. The fact that Rei knew her 
preferences only made her love the miko more.
