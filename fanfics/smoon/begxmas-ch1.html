<p>“Admit  it Rei! You’ve hated me! You’ve always hated me!!” Usagi  shouted.</p>
<p>Rei  blinked and shouted back, “No you idiot! I do <strong>not</strong> hate  you!!”</p>
<p>“Do to!”</p>
<p>“Do  not!”</p>
<p>“Do to!”</p>
<p>“Nuh-uh!”</p>
<p>“Yeah-huh!”</p>
<p>“<strong><em>Nuh-uhhhhhh!</em></strong>”</p>
<p>“<strong><em>Yeah-huhhhhhh!</em></strong>”</p>
<p>Finally,  Makoto cracked.</p>
<p>“I’m  gonna hate both of you if you don’t <strong><em>shut the hell up!</em></strong>”</p>
<p>The inner  senshi flinched and backed up a few paces. Usagi and Rei had  obviously quit shouting at each other in favor of grabbing each other  in fear of Makoto’s wrath. Ami and Minako began to giggle quietly  behind their hands.</p>
<p>Usagi’s  arms were wound tightly around Rei’s waist, her head tucked under  the miko’s chin. Rei’s arms were wrapped possessively around the  blonde’s shoulders. Her lavender eyes glared at the other senshi.  Suddenly the two girls noticed their position and sprang apart,  blushing.</p>
<p>“Told  you I didn’t hate you,” Rei murmured.</p>
<p>“…”   Usagi just looked away, a rosy blush still adorning her  cheeks.</p>
<p>Makoto  grinned and handed the blushing duo a square package.  Rei took it  and eyed it with a wary glance.</p>
<p>“What is  this?” she asked suspiciously. Makoto shook her head, grin still in  place. Ami and Minako were desperately trying to stifle their giggles  by clamping their hands over their mouths. Rei handed the gift to  Usagi (who squealed happily, mind you) and stared at the Senshi of  Ice with a long, cold stare. As planned, Ami began to sweat and  fidget nervously. Rei smirked and did a small mental victory dance.  Well, until Makoto pulled the blue haired genius out of the line of  fire.</p>
<p>“Knock  it off.” She growled. Rei shrugged and sighed as she saw Usagi rip  open the parcel with the energy of a child on its birthday.</p>
<p>Then,  quite suddenly, she completely deflated, a horrendous blush  encompassing her entire face.</p>
<p>Rei  blinked in confusion. “Usa-chan? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>The blond  immediately clutched the gift to her chest and shook her head.</p>
<p>“Usagi,”  Rei warned. “Give me the box.”</p>
<p>Usagi  shook her head again, clutching the box until her knuckles turned  white.</p>
<p>Rei wilted  in defeat. “A-alright Usa-chan. If you don’t trust me then…”  A few sniffles escaped as the raven haired girl’s shoulders began  to shake.</p>
<p>Ami,  Makoto, and Minako lifted an eyebrow at the obvious trap.</p>
<p><strong><em>Only  an <u>idiot </u>would fall for---</em></strong></p>
<p>“Oh  Rei-chan!” Usagi exclaimed, rushing over and placing a hand on the  miko’s back. “Onegaidon’t cry!”</p>
<p>Minako  blinked then smacked her forehead. “Usa-chan gives us blondes a bad  name…” she murmured.  Ami giggled quietly, sill held protectively  in Makoto’s arms.</p>
<p>Rei looked  over shoulder, smirked, and grabbed the box out of the startled moon  hime’s hand. Rei put one hand on Usagi’s forehead, effectively  keeping her away while Usagi swung her arms wildly.</p>
<p>“N-no!”  Usagi stuttered. But it was too late. Rei’s eyebrows shot up into  her hair as she gazed at the two girls on the cover of a doujinshi.</p>
<p>It was her  and Usagi.</p>
<p>Or, better  yet, Eternal Sailor Moon and Sailor Mars. Then again, it wasn’t the  fact that this doujinshi was a Moon and Mars pairing (there had been  several other issues of doujinshi that featured them together that  Rei had seen on the shelves of magazine racks). It was the way they  were holding each other.</p>
<p>It  happened to be the position that Rei and Usagi had found themselves  in just a few minute ago.</p>
<p>Sailor  Moon’s had entwined themselves around Mar’s waist (though one of  her hands was a tad bit more south than Rei remembered) and Mar’s  arms were wrapped tight around Sailor Moon’s shoulders. The Moon  Senshi’s eyes were closed as were Mar’s. To complete the artwork,  Eternal Sailor Moon’s wings surrounded them both. As did Venus’  Love-Me-Chain. The magical hearts were wrapped around the two  soldiers, tying them together.</p>
<p>Though the  romantic picture was interrupted with a large sticker exclaiming:</p>
<p>“ <strong><u><em>WARNING!!:    FOR ADULTS ONLY!!!!!!</em></u></strong></p>
<p>Rei felt  her right eye twitch.</p>
<p><em><strong>Those  sick, perverted asses—</strong></em></p>
<p>Rei’s  inner rant was interrupted when she saw that a particular page was  bookmarked. Gulping and taking a deep breathe for courage she took  the book out of the box and opened it to the page.</p>
<p>There was  a note (along with a <strong><em>very</em></strong> erotic scene involving the  Venus Love-Me-Chain from the cover).</p>
<p>It read:</p>
<p><strong><em>Rei-chan,  we’ve decided to give you and Usa-chan an early Christmas present!  This note, along with our manga, should tell you what <u>we</u> want  for Christmas!!</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Sincerely, </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Minako-chan, Ami-chan, and Makoto-chan!</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>P.S.:  We’ve included a little something else.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>P.S.S:  KISS HER ALREADY!!!!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>P.S.S.S:  Merry Christmas!!</strong></em></p>
<p>Rei felt  her eye twitch again as her stomach tightened in desire.</p>
<p><em><strong>Oh…crap…</strong></em></p>
<p>Slamming  the book closed Rei crumpled the note and directed an angry glare to  the other three Senshi, who were smiling quite impishly.</p>
<p>‘Reach  into the box!’ Minako mouthed.</p>
<p>Rei  grunted, but reached into the box…</p>
<p>…and  pulled out a Venus Love-Me-Chain, still glittering with suppressed  magic.</p>
<p>Rei’s  jaw dropped as she blushed. Usagi picked up the doujinshi and opened  up a bunny eared page. She felt her own jaw drop as she saw the very  same <strong><em>erotic</em></strong> picture involving the Love-Me-Chain. She  looked at the chain, then at the doujinshi, then at the chain again,  before she dared a glance at Rei.</p>
<p>She was  startled to see Rei staring at her with a strange gleam in her  lavender orbs. She stared back.</p>
<p>Time  seemed to tick away before…</p>
<p>“Rei-chan,”  Usagi whispered. “I think I…”</p>
<p>“Yeah.  Me too.”</p>
<p>Usagi  squealed and threw her arms around the surprised miko. “Good.”  She whispered, before sealing her lips over Rei’s. Rei made a  muffled sound in the back of her throat, waving her arms wildly in  the air.</p>
<p>Usagi  broke the kiss and blinked. “I thought you felt the same!” she  gasped in confusion.</p>
<p>Rei  blinked as well and answered, “I thought that you were saying that  you wanted to kill Mina-chan!”</p>
<p>Said  Senshi ‘eeped’ and hid behind Makoto. “Why me?” she whined.  “Ami and Makoto helped too!”</p>
<p>“I  dunno.” Rei shrugged. “I guess it’s because you piss me off  more than anyone else here.”</p>
<p>Minako  made a disgusted sound and crossed her arms over her chest. “That  is <strong><u><em>so</em></u></strong> sexist.”</p>
<p>Rei sweat  dropped. “Mina-chan, I’m a girl too. That’s not sexist.”</p>
<p>Minako  pondered, and then snapped her fingers in defeat. “But still! It’s  not fair that you kill me and not Ami-chan and Mako-chan!”</p>
<p>Makoto  tightened her grip on Ami. “Keep us outta this!” they both  exclaimed.</p>
<p>Rei  shrugged again. “Minako, isn’t this <strong><em>your</em></strong> Love-Me-Chain?”</p>
<p>Minako  whimpered and hid behind Makoto again. “Crap.” She grumbled.</p>
<p>Rei  chuckled and brought her gaze back down to the younger girl in front  of her. The blonde sniffled once, and then began to move out of Rei’s  arms.</p>
<p>“Whoa  there Trigger,” Rei teased as she wrapped the Love-Me-Chain around  Usagi’s waist. “Who said that I don’t love you?”</p>
<p>Usagi’s  eyes widened. “You mean you—“</p>
<p>“Yes”</p>
<p>“Oh  Rei-chan!”</p>
<p>Usagi  pulled Rei into another kiss and (making sure the others didn’t  see) Pinched the raven haired Senshi of Fire’s bottom. Rei jumped  and looked at Usagi. Usagi simply waggled her eyebrows and grinned.</p>
<p>Rei got  the message. “Usa no hentai!” she cooed. “You <strong><em>naughty </em></strong>little bunny you!”</p>
<p>As the  grinning duo swaggered into the temple, Rei twirling the  Love-Me-Chain around her fingers, Minako stared at their swaying  hips.</p>
<p>“Oooooooo!”  Ami started. “Mina-chan’s in trouble.”</p>
<p>“I’m  gonna tell Satsuna on you!” Makoto said.</p>
<p>Minako  paled at the mention of her green haired girlfriend. “No! Don’t  tell Sats-chan! I’ll be sleeping on the couch for <strong><em>months</em></strong>!!”</p>
