<p><u>“<em>Hi, my name is...- iii”</em></u></p>
<p>“U-SA-GI.”</p>
<p>“....ah....”, squeaked the young mother.</p>
<p>Ami  slipped her hand to the fore, snatching the piece of scribbled on  notepaper that Usagi used to jot down the information. She compared it  to the blinking arrivals announcement overhead.</p>
<p>“I see...”,  murmured the ever studious young woman. “The numbers were reversed. The  flight we’re looking for...is across from here.”</p>
<p>The infant, so aptly nick-named Chibi-Usa, gave a hearty giggle at that pronouncement.</p>
<p>Looking down the main causeway of the airport, an audible groan escaped Makoto’s lips. “We better get moving then...I just <em>hope</em>, Minako won’t be upset.”</p>
<p>Chibi-Usa wrinkled her nose and cooed, working her lips as she bubbled at her mother.</p>
<p>Usagi  glowered towards her child but none-the-less carried the bundle from  Makoto’s arms. She nuzzled her face into the crook of Chibi-Usa’s neck  and shoulder. Eliciting another bout of giggles. Stubby fingers found  their way into Usagi’s infamous – at least among her friends – <em>odangos</em> and began to tug at them with very little mercy.</p>
<p>“Matte! Matte!”, whined Usagi.</p>
<p>“Harder Chibi-Usa, teach your mother a lesson.”</p>
<p>“Mako-chan...That’s cruel – Don’t encourage her!”</p>
<p>Makoto  gave a roll of her shoulders as the lot of them caroused down the main  causeway. Ami stifled a laugh as Usagi wrestled with her babe. The  quickest route had them exiting whatever terminal they were at to hail  a mini-bus, or Quick-Tran to the next massive housing.</p>
<p>But even  before they had made it to a proper Quick-Tran point of embarkation, an  elongated polished to shine Limousine coasted to a halt before them.  The three women paused in their trek as the whirring sound of motors of  cogs eased the Limo’s darkly tinted windows down.</p>
<p>“Minna,” her  contralto timbre broke the shocked silence, but it was a sound they had  been accustomed to hearing her telecasted interviews, songs and  phonecalls.</p>
<p>“Minako-chan...! US...”</p>
<p>Usagi’s exclamation  was halted with the palm of Ami’s hand on her mouth. Meekly, the Child  Psychologist glanced to her friends and offered a soft, “Gomen.”</p>
<p>Pushing  the door opened the Starlet eased herself from the cab, in a motion of  fluid grace that only Minako had perfected. She flashed that patented  smile before she engulfed each woman in a fierce hug. Pausing finally  at Usagi. Minako’s gaze was drawn instantly towards the baby, “Almost a  replica, Usagi. She’s beautiful...” A wide curious gaze met Minako’s  own, berthing another smile from the Songstress.</p>
<p>“Hate t’burst your bubble, babe...” announced a basso tone, dripping with a southern tang.</p>
<p>The  American pulled himself from the other side of the Limo, long arms  draped lazily upon the top of the vehicle. He dipped his head towards  the horizon from where they had just come. Cresting the minute hill off  in the distance was a swarm of running people. Though distorted, thanks  to the heated asphalt, it wasn’t difficult to discern that the horde  that had greeted Minako - began to trail desperately in want of their  goddess.</p>
<p>“They ain’t gon’ give up till they got a piece of you. I suggest y’get your friends in,” commented Terry.</p>
<p>Sparing  very little time, the group dove into the cab of the limo, with Minako  bringing up the rear. Settling in Ami and Makoto peered through the  rear window, watching the encroaching sea of bodies. Incredibly, the  mass had closed the gap. Terry rapped on the privacy divider,  separating the cab from its frontal orifice. The driver only nodded his  understanding. With a sudden acceleration the limo jerked into  movement. Within the back, the women jostled to and fro. Usagi had  collided heads with Ami, pulling a pained outcry from both parties. The  baby, though, found the entire thing extremely delightful.</p>
<p>The  mass thankfully shrunk as they furthered from the airport. A wave of  relief blanketed Minako, her body slumped against the doorframe; the  adrenaline rush was still tingling through her, numbing her fingertips,  but the effects slowly wavered. She hadn’t expected this sort of  response to her arrival. Not for a star that’s had her fair share of  overexposure and tribulations in a career that had spanned near ten  years, give or take a few. Most would have faded into obscurity.  Sometimes, Minako had wished for that – wished for that moment of quiet  contentment...The kind that was only shared with the one she could bare  her soul to with little or no words at all.</p>
<p>But why she kept pushing herself to the brink – she never knew.</p>
<p>“Some welcome to Japan, eh?” A gruff voice pronounced.</p>
<p>Minako  lazed her gaze towards its source to only find that the three women  were pleasantly surprised at Terry’s slightly accented, yet perfect  Japanese. A wink was offered to the singer.</p>
<p>Clearing her voice,  “Gomenasai, minna,” said Minako, “This is Terry Lapps,” breaking into  English suddenly – as she knew, Terry preferred his native tongue above  all others. “Terry, my lifelong friends, Ami...”</p>
<p>“The Pediatrician/Psychologist,” mused Terry. The remark garnered a dip of Ami’s head as an acknowledgement.</p>
<p>“...Makoto,” continued Minako.</p>
<p>“Culinary student and co-owner of The Crown.” Makoto beamed proudly.</p>
<p>“...And Usagi,” concluded the icon.</p>
<p>“Yeah, can’t forget her – the rabid fan,” teased the wide receiver.</p>
<p>“Minako-chan...,”  replied Usagi who knew enough English to know that was a prod – no  doubt orchestrated by the Singer; she continued to bounce the child who  now lay asleep in her arms.</p>
<p>Minako grinned impishly and mouthed  her apologies towards Usagi before looking to Terry and adding in  Japanese, “You forgot to mention <em>mother &amp; narcoleptic housewife.</em>”</p>
<p>As  if on queue Usagi launched into how she did more than those things.  Just as Minako knew. But she had been impressed with Usagi – who in  truth worked as a guidance counselor at Juuban Middle School, alongside  with a fellow classmate – Osaka Naru, who became a teacher at the  school.</p>
<p>“So how far’s this hotel – I’m’a ‘bout ready t’pass out,  here...” interrupted Terry in English soon after the laughter rippled  through the cab.</p>
<p>Usagi and Makoto were at a loss to how respond;  never having been versed in the language, they were left looking  helpless. Ami, though – fared better but replying was a trial for her.  As she tried to offer an answer, Terry grew tired of wading through the  broken speech and glanced towards the Singer. Minako darted her eyes  towards her beau meeting his gaze evenly, not appreciating his  insistence on using English to express his needs.</p>
<p>She began softly and conveyed a subtle warning in English, “<em>When in Rome, do as the Romans do,” </em>concluding in her native tongue, “We’re not going to a hotel, I opted for something cozier.”</p>
<p>But  the warning fell on deaf ears, as he replied simply and stubbornly,  “A’right, your call – catchin’ a lil shut eye, babe. Wake me when we  get there, aite?”</p>
<p>Terry eased himself back against the plush  leather interior, nursing a little cocktail that he had previously  poured for himself. His arrogant comment left an air of tensed ambiance  among the rest of the occupants – at which, Minako was too dumbfounded  to refute only left to apologize for. Inwardly, she knew it was the  American thinking – he hadn’t meant to come off sounding as such, but  when you’re from a country that boasted opulence and power – You want  to make sure the lesser know who the Alpha is. As it was taught to  Terry Lapps.</p>
<p>The rest of the ride was one of quiet chatter –  catching up on lost time, guided by Usagi’s incessant tittering.  Thankfully, the tension slipped into oblivion as time stood still for  the four friends.</p>
<p>But something dawned on Ami, “Minako-chan?”</p>
<p>“Mm...?”</p>
<p>“Did you know we weren’t going to be at the right terminal?”</p>
<p>She nodded quietly.</p>
<p>“Uso!,” interjected both Makoto and Usagi.</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>Minako  lifted her gaze and considered the question and Usagi carefully – the  woman had grown, surely, becoming a mother as well was a transformation  all its own. But Usagi had never completely let go of that child-like  wonderment and excitable nature. Her mouth still moved faster than the  speed of light. Usagi’s thought process had no chance of catching up.  So she still remained as she always had. The one thing Minako counted  on.</p>
<p>Quietly, Minako turned her attention towards the passing scenery outside. “I think we <em>all</em> know the answer.”</p>
<p>“Nani? Nani? Nani?”</p>
<p>Whether  they remembered Terry being there was moot. The cab was soon drowned in  their gale of jocularity even in the midst of Usagi’s query.</p>
<hr />
Hikawa Temple sat in a quiet part of the neighborhood, nestled deep  into the wooded hillside, it remained untouched by the hand of progress  for more than three decades. Thankfully, a driveway had been  constructed that winds its way up to the plateau of where the actual  hospice is...well...was. Since Rei had left, it had closed its doors,  and served now as a quiet sentry with historical value. But tonight, as  was promised by Ami, Makoto and Usagi – Hikawa Temple will serve as  Minako’s place of stay during her time in Japan.
<p>Whatever  moonlight was pouring from the diamond-studded sky, it allowed shadows  and light to play over the aging edifice. Some would have thought this  ominous, but for Minako – it was a comfort. Terry was still tucked,  fast asleep in the limo, she didn’t have the heart to wake him, not  just yet. After having brought the threesome to their respective homes,  this was the only time the singer thought she would have time to  herself. As she crossed the paved courtyard, a soft glow had shown  through the Shoji doors, just as Usagi said it would be. It would mean  only one thing.</p>
<p>Discarding her sandals, the icon carefully eased  herself up the wooden stairway and rapped lightly on the doors  announcing her arrival before sliding them open. Despite being well  beyond tired, Minako’s body was urged forward, while her eyes searched  the interior. The tatami mats were well kept, and a table had been set  in the center of the room – it was topped with a tea set that held  freshly made brew, apparent with the tendril of smoke that trailed from  its depths. Bonsai plants dressed the perimeter, she noted – designed  to add a splash of color and balance out the Spartan decor.</p>
<p>“This is where she lived...”, was her soft prose. Not really registering what she had just uttered.</p>
<p>“Minako...?”  edged a voice from the fringes of the softly lit room. Then, a gentle  scuffing of feet on the tatami was heard soon after that.</p>
<p>Automatically,  her eyes lowered towards the floor, and a half smile was given at the  sight that greeted her. Kneeling, the woman scooped her one-time guide.  “Artemis.” She immediately coddled the plush ‘toy’, holding him fast to  her. At which he offered a gleeful snort of contentment basking in this  long awaited moment with his former charge. Far be it from Artemis to  confess she had meant more to him than just.</p>
<p>After a prolonged  minute or to Minako set him down. Plastic eyes peered upward at the  starlet. By no means young, and barely reaching her prime. How he  admired her.</p>
<p>“Luna and I prepared as much as we could on short notice, the futons are set in the next room.”</p>
<p>Minako  afforded a tired sigh coupled with the stifling of a yawn, “Thank you,  Artemis – we...I really appreciate you doing this.”</p>
<p>“It’s  nothing,” he softly replied. The plush toy waddled towards the  entryway, “Has he been good to you?” The question had been long in  coming; it was the nature of the guardian.</p>
<p>Minako’s attention  remained affixed as Artemis straggled past her, the question was  expected – but still caught her off guard. “He has been.” Another  question loomed in the back of the cat’s mind; one needn’t have been a  telepath to sense that. But before he had a chance to press, Minako  rose to her feet and murmured her reply, “It’s late Artemis – The  flight was long.”</p>
<p>“Ah, soo.” He was disappointed, Minako knew.  Taking the hint though Artemis, eased himself further from the inner  sanctum of the temple. “I’ll see you in the morning, then. Ja,  oyasumi.” She acknowledged with a nod.</p>
<p>Now...alone, perhaps for  the very first time in as many months, the Singer slipped from her  leather jacket, lobbing it aside unceremoniously upon the floor – she  wondered if the miko would have thrown a fit at that, a tickle of a  chuckle slipped from passed her lips. Her feet carried her to where the  miko slept; closing her eyes she found herself willing to hear it.  Minako could feel the lingering presence...now, if she could only hear  it.</p>
<p><em>Just once...</em></p>
<p>The reprimands.</p>
<p>The thrown challenges.</p>
<p>The comfort behind the intensity.</p>
<p>And for the second time in her charmed life – Aino Minako was  denied. Only the rustling of the leaves that clung to aging boughs  spoke in reply.</p>
<hr />
<em><u><strong>Just a few miles in the sky and a few hours...</strong></u></em>
<p><em>Fuck.</em></p>
<p>Her  stomach churned until it collapsed in on itself. That would have been  how she would have described it feeling like. The plane banked widely  before pointing its nose towards the earth. The movement caused another  wave of nausea to blanket over her hunched frame. And the complimentary  ‘discharge’ bag did very little to ease her discomfort of not only her  belly in turmoil, but that aggravating itch upon at her ear. Friendly  words though, lent some aid. Even if those words were offered from the  lips of a stranger.</p>
<p>“Just a few tic-tocs more, luv – ‘At’s a girl...”</p>
<p>The  miko had been paired with an elderly Englishman whom in a way, she had  used. She really couldn’t remember what he had rambled on about during  the fourteen-hour flight, but the incessant blather was a welcome  reprieve from her anxieties. Now, as the hours turned into minutes,  Rei’s resolve had deteriorated to mere nothing.</p>
<p>The airliner  shuddered as its landing gear berthed from beneath the cargo   raven-haired woman screwed her eyes closed waiting for the inevitable –  none too soon her silent prayers were answered as the plane touched the  earth. Letting loose her held-in breath, Rei slowly peeled her eyes  opened; the cabin was alive with passengers scurrying to be the first  to disembark.</p>
<p>“Pardon the old boy, miss...As much as I enjoyed your company – I do believe I’m losing circulation.”</p>
<p>Rei  blinked repetitiously as her eyes darted from the swarm of people in  the cabin, towards the elderly male’s face to her hand which hand gone  white knuckled about his wrist.</p>
<p>“o-oh,” quickly her hand loosened  before bolting from her seat. Her circulation regulated, sending a rush  of color to her cheeks. “I...don’t like planes, I’m sorry for that,”  was her quick, maybe slightly muttered prose. She had hoped that lame  excuse was enough.</p>
<p>The Englishman gave an amused chuckle and a  pat at the back of the miko’s hand, “No need to explain – There are  certain things that make most notably do not agree with us in life,  but...we have to face them. It’s the risk we take – it’s why it’s  called <em>life.</em>” He smiled and winked, “Now, pay no mind to this codger, but flying for that long, me bladder’s about te burst.”</p>
<p>Rei’s  lips twitched into a half smile as she allowed the elder man to pass.  Her seatmate proffered a quick English two-fingered salute and was  quickly swallowed into the fray. She remained there till it was light  in traffic enough for the miko to fall in step. The words that that  gentleman had given, was the proverbial slap she needed.</p>
<p>Sooner  than expected, the miko had found herself expelled from the tunnels.  Tossing the semi-filled contents of that pungent paper bag in the  nearest receptacle, Rei made for the nearest phones.</p>
<p>“11:25, Artemis or Luna should be there.”</p>
<hr />
<em>There was a pulse of light.</em>
<p><em>The warmth of it was  overwhelming. So inviting – to be blanketed within it would be a  blessing, she firmly believed this. The pain was gone from her  physically – no longer was she suffering from explosive headaches that  incapacitated her almost on a daily basis. She didn’t even have the  means to beg the heavens for it to stop.</em></p>
<p><em>But she couldn’t  leave just yet. Denying that eternal rest, she lingered. A battle was  ensuing just below. Opulent colors, pink, blue, white...and flame-red  illuminated the darkened night sky. They waned in their intensity after  an engulfing column of fire spewed forth. Its victim writhed in agony  at its deliverance. The pained scream soon silenced.</em></p>
<p><em>The  Senshi remained rooted, her elegant gloved hands were extended; limply  they dropped to her sides. Her comrade, called for her. In a trance,  the Senshi could only respond with a soft three syllable choked sob.  The Senshi collapsed to her knees, then, a sorrowful cry erupted from  her lips.</em></p>
<p>“<em>MINAKO!”</em></p>
<p><em>Before she could respond, the light gently curled about her form and pulled her home.<br />
</em></p>
<hr />
A bleary eye peeled open. <em>11:27...Christ.</em>
<p>The tinny ring of the telephone blared, the woman was jockeyed from her restless sleep against her lover – <em>the dream again – </em>in aggravation she whimpered softly, “No...don’t leave Terry, a few more minutes.”</p>
<p>“Might  be Dennis and th’crew baby, can’t leave them stranded at the airport,”  he kissed her forehead gently and snaked his way from her.</p>
<p>The  heat and gentle thrumming of his heart left her. Curling up under the  mass futon blanket, she peered at the handsome, well-defined, albeit  naked man. They had made love last night, despite being overwhelmingly  tired – but as always, he was gentle with her, and not once but twice  was she bought to the brink and rode that wave of exquisite ecstasy.</p>
<p>She  had asked him to love her – and he readily complied. He always did.  Minako needed to feel that white-hot release, it was the only time she  reached that subspace and forgot every earthly confinement and the  weight of her heavy soul. Deep cocoa eyes focused on her young lover’s  back. A smirk trailed over her lips. Silently she prowled from the  covers of the futon.</p>
<p>Minako still had it, those feathery quiet  movements; once at her target, her arms curled about Terry’s taut  waistline, with her fingernails cloying gently at his abdomen, she  laughed softly and nipped his shoulder. He chuckled and held the  receiver to her. Quizzically she eyed the piece...</p>
<hr />
“Artemis?”
<p>“<em>Who? Don’t know anyone by that name, sweets. Y’gots th’Dawg on the line wit’chu. Talk t’me.”</em></p>
<p><em>An American? </em>“Ahh, sorry...”,Rei furrowed her brows, <em>Did she dial the right number? </em> The priestess began rifling through her knapsack, only to pause in stark realization. <em>No...</em></p>
<p>The  raven-haired woman swallowed hard, pressing the earpiece harder to her  ear. The miko listened intently, she heard scuffing in the background. <em>There</em>. A laugh. <em>It was her laugh.</em> It hadn’t changed. The American quickly mumbled a reply, his hand no doubt on the speaker end of the phone.</p>
<p>“...<em>some...chick...lookin’...Artie... said...no...here.”</em></p>
<p>The phone was handed off. Rei’s grip about the inanimate object tightened, rapt with the need to hear her. <em>A breath.</em> Her breath. Minako hadn’t covered the mouthpiece as she offered her comment to the American.</p>
<p>“...<em>You spoke in English again, didn’t you Terry? What did we talk about, honey....”</em></p>
<p>“<em>it slipped out, you know me,” </em>was the American’s protest,<em> “May’ve been the tall one, Makoto? Finish up the call, I needja...”</em></p>
<p>A  few more sounds played out...inaudible at first, but Rei was able to  make out the quick breaths taken and her soft mewl. But they stopped;  she must have regained her senses.</p>
<p>“<em>Makoto? I’m sorry about Terry...If you’re looking for Artemis, he could be at Usagi’s...we’re still on for the picnic, h...”</em></p>
<p>The miko had no reason to.</p>
<p>No reason to feel the pain, no reason to feel the rage – she had no <em>reason</em>. But ‘Yesterday’, was all that filled her mind.</p>
<p><em>I shouldn’t’ve come...What the hell were you THINKING? WHAT, Rei?</em></p>
<p>In  one breath, Minako opened the floodgates of her memories. Rei had  slammed the phone back unto its cradle, ending the call abruptly.</p>
<p>On the other end a steady beep greeted the Singer.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>-Minako’s little dream sequence was a little snippet from PGSM Act 47 – Watch it.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>-It was a tad tricky to write up the phone coversation,  switching from what was happening on Terry/Minako's end, to Rei's end,  sorry for the confusion!</em></p>
