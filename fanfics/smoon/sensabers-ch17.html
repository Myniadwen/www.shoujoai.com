<a href="../smoon/sensabers-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>Kaori turned the tumbler of golden alcohol around
slowly in her hands, studying it&#39;s depths with a
thoughtful expression on her pretty face. Finally he
redheaded business woman brought it to her lips and
drank some carefully, the few glasses that she had
already drank leaving her feeling a bit tipsy.

&quot;You wanna talk about it?&quot; the bartender asked, the
tall, blue haired woman wiping down the counter top
casually.

&quot;Would it help?&quot; Kaori looked up at those almost
catlike eyes.

&quot;Might make you feel better,&quot; the woman said as she
poured a soda and offered it to Kaori instead of more
booze.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Kaori sighed. She took a drink, &quot;I&#39;ve got a
new employer, been working for her a couple of weeks.&quot;

&quot;Um-hm,&quot; the bartender prompted gently.

&quot;She&#39;s...&quot; Kaori&#39;s eyes focusesd on something off in
the distance, &quot;dynamic, forceful, energetic, all the
things a executive should be.&quot;

&quot;But?&quot; she asked.

&quot;She&#39;s also so alone that it&#39;s not funny, and has a
tender side that breaks my heart,&quot; Kaori softly
admitted.

&quot;And you&#39;ve fallen for her,&quot; the bartender noted
gently.

Kaori sighed as she drank some soda, &quot;Yeah, I guess I
have.&quot;

&quot;She know that you&#39;re so inclined?&quot; the bartender
asked wryly.

&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Kaoru shook her head, &quot;up until
now I&#39;ve done my best to keep my work and personal
lives separate.&quot;

Cleaning a glass the taller woman asked, &quot;Do you want
her to know?&quot;

&quot;I... don&#39;t know,&quot; Kaori sighed.

&quot;It&#39;s safer admiring from afar, but you&#39;ll never know
if she could care for you or not unless you try,&quot; she
noted.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Kaori sounded more than a bit unconvinced.

&quot;Hey Ryouko,&quot; a voice called from up the bar, &quot;I&#39;m
dying over here!&quot;

&quot;Keep your shirt on, Misato!&quot; Ryouko yelled back
before turning to look at Kaori apologetically.
&quot;Sorry, gotta get back to work.&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Kaori got up, glad to feel herself
wobble only a little.

&quot;You need a ride?&quot; Ryouko checked her over carefully.

&quot;I&#39;ll call a taxi,&quot; Kaori reassured her.

&quot;Then I hope you have a good night,&quot; Ryouko smiled
down at her, &quot;and thanks for visiting Arisugawa&#39;s
Locket.&quot;

Kaori walked off as she waved, &quot;Thanks.&quot;

Hailing a taxi was fairly easy, her pay-card covering
the fare as Kaori looked out the window, her thoughts
less on her surroundings and more on her enigmatic
employer, Hotaru Tomoe. She, of course, knew that her
boss was really a Bio-boomer, but oddly she found that
didn&#39;t bother her. If she was going to be honest
Hotaru seemed more human than her father, Prof. Tomoe
had been.

No, what bothered Kaori was her confusion over her own
feelings. Up to a month ago she would have sworn that
she was straight, not even the currently popular
bisexual. In college and university she had dated
boys, and once graduating she had used her academic
gifts along with her looks to advance up the corporate
ladder. Occasionally there had been instances where
she had to sleep with a executive, and she had done so
with no qualms.

Looking back now Kaori realized there might have been
a few careful passes from female employers, but at the
time she just hadn&#39;t noticed them. No one could out
and out proposition someone, regulations forbade that,
so things had to be approached cautiously. Kaori had
gotten pretty good at reading a male boss&#39; signals,
but it seemed that she was somewhat oblivious to a
woman&#39;s interest.

&#39;Not that I&#39;ve seen any such signs coming from Hotaru,
either,&#39; Kaoru reminded herself of that fact glumly.

Hotaru Tomoe was kind, polite, and warmly attentive to
Kaori when they worked together, but that could simply
be her being kind. Yes, she had even acted to protect
Kaori when she insisted on acompaning her on a
expedition to investigate Mistress Nine, but that
might have just been her ordinary kindness.

&quot;Ooh, I just don&#39;t know,&quot; Kaori groaned aloud.

&quot;Don&#39;t know what, ma&#39;am?&quot; the Bio-boomer driving the
taxi asked.

&quot;Never mind,&quot; Kaori blushed, not having intended to
say anything out loud.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; the Bio-boomer cabby said cheerfully as they
pulled up to Kaori&#39;s building. &quot;Thank you for using
our service, and please do so again.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do that,&quot; Kaori agreed, feeling just a bit
unsteady as she left the cab.

Pulling her coat around her Kaori used her key card to
gain access then headed upstairs, fumbling a bit as
she unlocked her door. The apartment within reflected
well on the corporate rising star that lived there, a
luxurious kitchen/bedroom/den combination that a
average office lady couldn&#39;t think of affording.
Taking off her shoes and coat at the took she padded
in socks through to her bedroom, flopping on the bed
without even undressing.

&quot;Jus&#39; lay down a bit,&quot; Kaori mumbled, &quot;get undressed
later.&quot; A few moments later, and she was sound asleep.

Yuko Arimura looked up from the reception desk as
Kaori rushed in, the stylishly dressed red head
looking sultry and dangerous. &quot;You look somewhat the
worse for wear,&quot; she noted with a slight smile.

&quot;Over indulged a bit,&quot; Kaori conceded, now dressed in
her usual office wear, a dark skirt and suit top
hugging her form.

&quot;The media are still trying to get personal interviews
with Miss Tomoe,&quot; Yuko handed the yellow message
sheets over, &quot;your personal secretary has also been
fielding calls.&quot; Of course they all had electronic
messaging, but many callers still insisted on leaving
written messages such as these with staff.

&quot;Oh, lovely,&quot; Kaori reluctantly took the papers with a
sigh. &quot;Is Miss Tomoe in yet?&quot; she asked thoughtfully.

&quot;No, but Mimi, Lulu and Yui are.&quot; Yuko looked
sympathetic, &quot;I assume the section heads are looking
for a bit of guidence.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Kaori nodded, walking to the elevator.

Being second in command of Infinity was something
Kaori had been doing for months, but at least now she
had a title and pay to match her responsibilities.
Though she often wondered if a larger office was
really worth all the headaches she had to deal with.
Still, she was doing this for Hotaru, so...

&quot;Good morning, ma&#39;am,&quot; her bio-boonmer secretary
Cyprine nodded, her dark blue hair tied back in a
complicated braid. Instead of business wear she was
dressed in a black body suit with red trim, giving her
a exotic look.

&quot;Morning Cyprine,&quot; Kaori nodded graciously.

&quot;You have additional messages from Mimi at public
relations, Lulu in advertizing and Yui in resrearch
and development,&quot; Cyprine reported brightly, &quot;all
claim to be urgent.&quot;

&quot;They always are,&quot; Kaori said wryly. &quot;The messages are
in my inbox?&quot; she asked.

&quot;As usual, ma&#39;am,&quot; Cyprine nodded. &quot;Would you like for
me to get you a coffee?&quot; she asked in a perky sort of
way.

&quot;I&#39;m fine, thanks,&quot; Kaori nodded as she went into her
inner office.

Cyprine was one of the new model Bio-boomers, based
off of improved designs derived from Doctor Mizuno&#39;s
work, and the difference between her and earlier
models was remarkable. She seemed much more personable
and outgoing, as well as being quite frankly
beautiful.

&#39;I suspect we&#39;ll sell plenty to business men based off
their looks alone,&#39; Kaori thought wryly. Sitting
behind her desk she took in her inbox with dismay, the
stack of folders nearly a foot high despite the fact
she had emptied it yesterday. &quot;Oh well,&quot; she sighed as
she pulled the first folder off the top of the stack,
&quot;time to work.&quot;

RING RING!

&quot;Gah,&quot; Kaori sighed, picking up her phone. &quot;Yes,
Mimi?&quot; she asked.

&quot;How did you know it was me?&quot; Mimi sounded annoyed,
and Kaori could easily imagine the look on the blonde
girl&#39;s face.

&quot;Because you&#39;re the only perason I know of with the
guts to use my private line,&quot; Kaori said, adding
mentally, &#39;other than Miss Tomoe, of course.&#39; Sorting
documents she asked, &quot;So what&#39;s going on now?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Mimi paused then went into full on gossip
queen mode.

Listening to her friend and co-worker natter on Kaori
sighed. &#39;Why did I take this promotion again? Oh
right, because Miss Tomoe asked me to,&#39; she mused,
waiting for Mimi to slow down enough for her to get a
word in edgewise. Sadly, by the sound of it Mimi was
going to be at this for awhile.

To be continued...

Notes: Yes, that&#39;s Ryouko from Arisugawa&#39;s Locket
offering a sympathetic ear. All the staff mentioned in
the Infinity bit are in fact members of the Witches
Five in the anime/manga of Sailor Moon.</pre>
