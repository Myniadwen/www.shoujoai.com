<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a>

<a href="../smoon/regnum-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>[Spring 2004]

As they finished their dinner together, Minako was not the only 
one who felt light-headed.  Not since her abortive attempts to 
woo Mamoru had Rei spent such a concentrated amount of time 
flirting.  With &quot;Aino Minako&quot; nowhere to be seen, they had been 
able to eat in peace.  More than once, Rei thanked the kami for 
whomever had decided to decorate the tables with floor-length 
tablecloths, as she and Mina played footsie throughout the meal.  
Still, it was a bit jarring trying to reconcile Mina&#39;s 
personality with the image of the young man in front of her.  

Rather than return straight to the hotel after dinner, they 
decided to take a stroll together under the moonlight, as they 
had frequently done back at Rei&#39;s shrine when they were 
teenagers.  No one gave the happy couple a second glance as they 
appeared to be nothing more than a young man and woman sharing a 
romantic walk through the park.  

&quot;Mina-chan,&quot; Rei finally said, &quot;can I ask you something?&quot;  

&quot;Of course you can, silly.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no one here now, and it&#39;s rather dark.  Could you change 
back?&quot;  Rei stopped to face her friend, though she kept her gaze 
focused on the ground between them.  

Without a word Minako pulled the transformation pen out of her 
pocket and spoke the words that would return her to her normal 
form.  &quot;Is that better, Rei?&quot; she asked carefully.

Rei noticed the change in address immediately and lifted her 
moist eyes to Mina&#39;s. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I know why you did it, but it 
just wasn&#39;t my Mina.&quot;

&quot;You know that it is all just an illusion.  It&#39;s still me there, 
you only see something different,&quot; Minako explained.   

&quot;I know, Mina, but,&quot; Rei paused, gathering her thoughts, &quot;for our 
first night together, I don&#39;t want to remember anything other 
than you.  Do you understand?&quot;

Minako beamed at her.  &quot;Our first night together?&quot; she asked, her 
heart beating its way out of her chest.

&quot;Our first night together like this,&quot; Rei answered, wrapping her 
arms around Minako&#39;s back and pulling her close.  Their heads 
tilted and their eyes closed as Rei slowly brought her lips to 
meet Mina&#39;s.  Their first kiss was soft and tender and lasted 
forever.  

------------------------------

Ami nuzzled closer to Makoto&#39;s warm skin, enjoying the feel of 
the silk sheets against her skin.  Now those had been a good 
purchase!  A wondrous night of passion and love, fierce need and 
tender sharing, had finally left the two of them exhausted, 
asleep in each other&#39;s arms.  Upon waking, it had taken Ami a 
moment or two to remember what had happened, but when she did a 
cozy feeling of happiness had settled over her.  

As she luxuriated in the moment, Ami felt Makoto&#39;s hand slide 
delicately up her spine to caress her neck and scalp.  &quot;Good 
morning, my love,&quot; Makoto said quietly.  

Ami tilted her head so she could see Mako&#39;s face.  In it, she 
found all of her own joy reflected.  &quot;Good morning to you.&quot; She 
leaned up to kiss her lover softly and then settled back down 
against her pillowy chest.  

Toying with Ami&#39;s hair, letting it run through her fingers, 
Makoto whispered, &quot;You know, for two people who have never done 
anything like that before, I think we did rather well.&quot;  Ami&#39;s 
smile and its accompanying blush were sweeter than any sunrise.  

&quot;Well,&quot; Ami answered demurely, &quot;I have done a lot of reading.&quot;

Makoto laughed and raised an eyebrow.  &quot;Oh really?  And are you 
going to share all of your learning with me?&quot;

&quot;Eventually,&quot; Ami replied, &quot;but slowly, I think.  Why rush 
things?&quot;

&#39;Because I&#39;m going back to Europe in a few days,&#39; Makoto thought 
ruefully.  She didn&#39;t say this, though, as she had no intention 
of breaking the mood.

&quot;I love you, Ami,&quot; Makoto said with a sudden intensity.  

&quot;I know, Mako. You showed me that more than I could have ever 
dreamed last night.  I love you too.&quot;

&quot;Yes, but in all the excitement, I never really got to tell you.&quot;  

&quot;But you did,&quot; Ami protested.

Makoto hushed her, laying a finger lightly on her lips.  Ami&#39;s 
kiss sent chills across her bare skin.

&quot;You&#39;re so perfect, Ami,&quot; Makoto explained. &quot;Perfect for me, 
anyway.  You said that it used to be hard not to look at me all 
the time.  Well, I noticed that you did, because I couldn&#39;t take 
my eyes off of you either.  I think from the moment I first saw 
you, part of me knew.&quot;  

Makoto shifted herself so that she was sitting up, her back 
against the headboard and Ami&#39;s head resting on her lap.  She 
continued to stroke her hair as she spoke.  &quot;You&#39;ve never judged 
me, Ami.  So many people who meet me make so many assumptions, 
develop so many preconceptions.  I&#39;m this.  I&#39;m that.  You never 
do that.  You&#39;ve always seen right through to the real me, and 
you&#39;ve always accepted me.  I can&#39;t tell you how much that has 
meant to me.&quot;

&quot;Oh Mako love,&quot; Ami sighed, sniffling back some tears.

&quot;Shhh, let me finish,&quot; Makoto insisted gently.  &quot;I&#39;ve always 
looked up to you.  Not just because you&#39;re the smartest person in 
the world, but because you don&#39;t try to hide it.  You&#39;re proud of 
what you&#39;ve accomplished, even when others have tried to tease 
you or chide you for it.  Even though you have so many 
responsibilities, so much work, you always make time for your 
friends.  You&#39;re always looking for a way to give of yourself.  I 
admire you so much, Ami.

&quot;Those are all things that anyone could see, if they really 
looked, though.  I think the things I love most are the things 
that only I get to see.  Sometimes, you are so strong and 
confident, that after I talk to you I feel like there is no 
obstacle in the world I can&#39;t overcome.  Other times, you are so 
vulnerable, almost fragile, and I just want to wrap you in my 
arms and take you away from the whole world, keeping you all for 
myself.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Ami sighed.  &quot;Sometimes.&quot;

Makoto giggled, &quot;I know, love.&quot;  Bending over, she kissed her 
girlfriend deeply before continuing.  &quot;You&#39;re so beautiful; your 
eyes sparkle and shine.  I could lose myself in them forever.&quot;  
Makoto&#39;s lips brushed Ami&#39;s eyes lightly.  &quot;And your skin is so 
soft and smooth.  It makes these sheets feel like sandpaper.&quot;  
Makoto&#39;s hands traced lines up and down Ami&#39;s side, raising 
goosebumps where they passed.   Slowly, Makoto slid Ami out of 
her lap to lay her down on the bed.  As she did, her fingers 
began to roam more freely.  &quot;To say nothing of how incredibly 
sexy you are here.&quot;  Ami shuddered, eyes closing. &quot;And here.&quot;  
Now a sudden gasp for air.  &quot;And....&quot; Makoto&#39;s travelogue ceased 
as her lips became otherwise engaged.

&quot;Oh Mako,&quot; Ami moaned, surrendering herself completely.  

-----------------------------

Mina transformed back into herself again as soon as they got to 
their suite.  Despite the late hour, a number of her more devoted 
fans still lingered in the lobby of the hotel.  They didn&#39;t pay 
any attention to the happy young couple holding hands and 
snuggling against one another on their way to the elevators.  

Removing her jacket and hanging it neatly, Rei entered their 
shared room and sat down on the sofa there, sliding her shoes off 
onto the floor.  

&quot;How can you stand to wear high heels all the time?&quot; Mina asked 
her.  &quot;And how can you fight in them?&quot;

&quot;Practice,&quot; Rei answered with a knowing smile.  &quot;It is my 
trademark, after all, the &#39;pretty soldier in a sailor suit and 
high heels&#39;.&quot;  

&quot;Very pretty,&quot; Mina murmured as she settled in next to Rei.  

&quot;You do flatter me so.&quot;  It still surprised Rei how much she 
enjoyed playing innocent with Mina.  

&quot;It&#39;s not flattery when it&#39;s true,&quot; Minako pointed out.   
Deliberately, she moved closer until she pressed against Rei&#39;s 
side.  One hand moved to caress Rei&#39;s cheek as their lips came 
together once again.  

Quite awhile later, Rei gently pushed Mina back.  Her skin was 
flushed and she found it hard to catch her breath.  &quot;I think we 
should get to bed, Mina.  You have a show to do tomorrow night, 
after all, and a number of appearances to make during the day.&quot;

&quot;You sound like my agent,&quot; Mina laughed, standing up reluctantly.  
She extended a hand and helped Rei to her feet as well.  &quot;So, my 
love, your room or mine?&quot;

Rei laughed and swatted Mina&#39;s behind.  &quot;Both, silly.&quot;  Seeing 
the confusion on Mina&#39;s face, and the slight beginnings of hurt, 
Rei hugged her close.  &quot;Mina love, we have all the time in the 
world in front of us.  Please, let&#39;s not rush anything.  I want 
to savor every moment.  We have so many wonderful things ahead of 
us.&quot;  

Mina nodded, still disappointed, but able to understand. 

&quot;Besides,&quot; Rei added in a playful tone, &quot;I&#39;m just an innocent 
miko.  What did you expect on a first date?&quot;

&quot;As long as it is the first of many,&quot; Mina insisted.

Once again, Rei pulled her close, this time adding a languorous 
kiss to their embrace.  &quot;The first of forever, my love.&quot;  When 
she felt her resolve creaking, Rei let Mina go and turned back to 
her room.  As she did, she noticed something.  &quot;Looks like you 
have a message, Mina.&quot;  

&quot;That&#39;s odd, usually all calls get routed to my staff,&quot; Minako 
observed as she too saw the red light blinking on the phone.  &quot;It 
must be something important.&quot;   After listening a bit, she added, 
&quot;It&#39;s from Usagi.  She wants me to call her right away.&quot; 

Minako set the phone down and thought for a moment.  She could 
still hear Rei&#39;s words from the wedding in her ears.  &#39;I&#39;m over 
her.&#39;  Still, she couldn&#39;t help but have some lingering doubts.

Rei started to reply, until she noticed Mina&#39;s eyes. Immediately, 
she understood.   Her expression grew serious as she once again 
closed the gap between them.  &quot;Mina, I&#39;ll always love Usagi. As a 
friend. I can&#39;t deny that I used to wish for something more, but 
that was a long time ago.  I&#39;m an adult now, and I&#39;ve realized 
many things about life, about myself.  One thing I learned a few 
months ago is that I&#39;ve gotten over her.  However, the most 
important thing I&#39;ve learned is that I love you, Aino Minako.  
You are my soulmate and you are the person I want to share my 
life with.&quot;  

With a happy sigh, Minako let Rei gather her in her arms, 
surreptitiously wiping her tears on Rei&#39;s blouse.  For a long 
time, she simply let Rei hold her.   Finally, she looked up.  
&quot;She would have driven you crazy anyway, you know.&quot;  

Rei laughed heartily.  &quot;You&#39;re right, she would have.  Not that 
you won&#39;t too, sometimes.&quot;  Mina joined her in laughing at that.  
&quot;Now, my love, you need to return that call and then get your 
sleep.  I do, too.  I have quite a bit of shopping and 
sightseeing planned while you&#39;re working tomorrow.&quot;  

-------------------------

&quot;Mako, can I ask you something?&quot;

&quot;Of course, you can ask me anything.&quot;

Ami took a deep breath.  &quot;Do you still have feelings for...&quot;

&quot;For Minako?&quot; Makoto finished.  She sighed, not surprised by the 
question.  She certainly owed Ami an answer.  &quot;She&#39;s one of my 
closest friends, just as she is one of yours, Ami, but that&#39;s 
all.  We talked before I left for Paris and I&#39;ll tell you what I 
told her then.&quot;  She shifted so she could look Ami directly in 
the eyes.  

&quot;I was scared, Ami.  Scared, and alone.  Then, I found all of you 
and I learned about my destiny and everything seemed to click 
into place.  Well, almost everything.  When I was Sailor Jupiter, 
nothing frightened me and I knew that together we could defeat 
any challenge.  But, when I was just Kino Makoto, I was still a 
scared, lonely girl trying to understand all of the strange 
feelings inside me.  No matter what kind of front I put on 
things, no matter what I did to occupy my time, I couldn&#39;t hide 
from the way I felt.&quot;

&quot;Never &#39;just Kino Makoto&#39;,&quot; Ami whispered.  &quot;I&#39;ve learned so much 
since I&#39;ve been over here and heard so many horror stories.  Oh 
Mako, it was so hard on all of us.  At least here, in many 
colleges anyway, there are support networks for lesbians.&quot;

The word still struck Makoto as odd, though she knew it applied.  
Hopefully, she&#39;d learn to accept herself the way Ami had some 
day.  Even as she made that wish, Makoto knew for certain that 
she would, and that Ami would be the one to help her do it.  

&quot;I just wanted to be safe, to keep things the way they were,&quot; 
Makoto went on.  &quot;We&#39;d all already kind of worshipped Sailor 
Venus from afar, so it wasn&#39;t a big leap to develop a crush on 
her.  Your videotape, though, made me look at things that I&#39;d 
tried to avoid.  Mina was safe, because she so obviously loved 
Rei.  You, you were dangerous.&quot;

&quot;Only in the good ways,&quot; Ami purred.  In a lighter tone, she 
added, &quot;Thank you, love.  I didn&#39;t really doubt you, you know, I 
just...&quot;

&quot;You needed to hear me say it, Ami.  You deserved to hear me say 
it.  I love you, and only you.&quot;

&quot;And you do it so very well,&quot; Ami pointed out, her voice growing 
more steamy and innuendo-laden.  &quot;In fact, since we don&#39;t have 
any plans, maybe you could...&quot;

The ringing of the phone disrupted that chain of thought, much to 
both Ami and Mako&#39;s dismay.  Reluctantly, Ami disengaged herself 
from Makoto.  &quot;Hello,&quot; she answered in English.  After pulling 
the receiver away from her ear to save her hearing, she listened 
for a moment and then flashed a worried frown at Makoto.   &quot;It&#39;s 
Usagi.  Shingo has passed away and Kenji-papa is very very ill.&quot;
