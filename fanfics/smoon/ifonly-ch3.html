<h1>If Only (part 3 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/meikosama.html">Azfixiation</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/ifonly-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;Stand back,&quot; a strange man called out to Makoto. The tall girl
complied, not wanting to risk Minako getting hurt. The stranger had
broken into Makoto&#39;s apartment and was holding a knife to Minako&#39;s
throat.

&quot;Please, whatever you want. Just don&#39;t hurt her. If you&#146;re going to hurt
someone, hurt me. Please,&quot; Makoto begged the man as tears ran down
her cheeks.

&quot;Why would you rather have me hurt you than her? Is she really that
important to you?&quot; The man tightened his grip on Minako and pushed
the knife harder against her skin, just barely cutting it.

When Makoto saw the blood dripping from Minako&#39;s neck she dropped
to her knees while her tears flowed freely down her red cheeks. &quot;Please,
don&#39;t. Kill me but don&#39;t touch her.&quot;

&quot;Makoto, no.&quot; Minako whispered. She had never been so scared in all
her life. Fighting as Sailor Venus was one thing but in this situation she
was completely powerless. She had no choice but to stand there, and
hope that nothing bad would happen to her, or her best friend. &quot;Look, if
your going to kill me do it, but if you touch her I will kill you.&#148;
Minako barked at the man knowing it was foolish since he was the one
in control, and the knife was pressed tight to her throat.

&quot;Minako, you don&#39;t know what your saying. If anything happened to you
I&#39;d never be able to live. Just leave her alone,&quot; Makoto said looking at
the man.

&quot;And I couldn&#39;t live this life if anything were to happen to you Mako-chan. I&#39;m too in love with you.&quot; Minako said as the knife cut her even
more.

&quot;Aren&#39;t you two forgetting something? I&#39;m in charge here,&quot; the man
shouted. &quot;Now cut the mushy crap out before I kill both of you.&quot;

-------

Just then the sound of the doorbell woke Makoto from her nightmare.
She noticed she was out of breath and her face was wet from the tears
she cried in her sleep. She looked around her dark room trying to
remember what she was doing sleeping, and why her doorbell was
ringing. When she recalled her day with Minako she smiled and figured
she must have fallen asleep while Minako was giving her a massage.

After she finished cursing herself for falling asleep while she was
getting such great treatment from Minako she thought more about her
nightmare and how Minako told her she loved her in it. &quot;Baka, it was
just a dream. She&#39;s not really in love with you.&quot; Makoto told herself as
she got out of her bed and went to find her friend.

As she stepped out of her room she noticed that her apartment was
completely dark, not counting several candles that were lit throughout
it, and the kitchen light that was on. She figured Minako must be in
there so headed there immediately still wanting to be reassured that her
friend was okay and her dream was indeed a dream.

She saw Minako standing next to the counter putting away dishes while
humming to herself. &quot;She looks just like an angel,&quot; Makoto thought to
herself as she silently watched her friend. It took all her strength to keep
herself from running to Minako and just taking her in her arms and
confessing her love. Minako finally turned around noticing her and
jumped slightly from being surprised.

&quot;How long have you been standing there?&quot; Minako asked smiling at her
friend while she moved closer to her. Makoto didn&#39;t say anything for a
minute and Minako noticed that her eyes were all puffy and could see
the streaks from the tears left on her face. &quot;Mako-chan? Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;Un. I just had a bad dream is all and it kinda freaked me out.&quot; Makoto
tried to reassure her friend.

&quot;What was it about?&quot; Minako took hold of Makoto&#39;s hand and looked at
her sadly not liking the thought of Makoto ever being upset about
anything.

&quot;I&#39;d rather not say.&quot; Makoto looked away from the blonde.

&quot;Please tell me Mako-chan. If it upset you so much then maybe we
should talk about it.&quot;

&quot;Well I&#39;ll tell you about it, but only if you tell me what&#39;s up with all
these candles and such first.&quot; Makoto smiled down at Minako noticing
for the first time that Minako was holding her hand.

&quot;Well I wanted you to wake up and have a nice dinner. I tried to cook
but well uhh..&quot; Minako giggled a little to herself recalling what a
disaster that turned out to be and how thankful she was that she
managed to get the kitchen clean before Makoto woke up.

&quot;But what?&quot; Makoto&#39;s eyes narrowed in question.

&quot;Well let&#146;s just say that didn&#39;t turn out to well. But I ordered pizza to
make up for it.&quot; Minako said cheerfully. &quot;Hey we should eat before it
gets cold too,&quot; she added.

&quot;That still doesn&#39;t explain the candles Minako-chan.&quot; Makoto said as
she helped herself to some pizza.

After a moment of hesitation Minako decided to answer the question
truthfully. &quot;Well it has to do with the dinner thing. I wanted it to
be...romantic.&quot; Makoto felt herself choke on the pizza when Minako
said that. Minako could only laugh as Makoto&#39;s face turned red. Before
Makoto could question her more about it Minako changed the subject
not wanting to give too much away just yet.

-----

When dinner was finished and the two girls cleaned up a little bit they
sat down in the living room and Minako felt it was time to get Makoto
to tell her about this dream she had. &quot;Come on Mako-chan. You&#39;ve
never kept anything from me before so why start now?&quot;

Makoto was scared of telling Minako about her dream. She knew if she
were to tell her Minako would finally know for sure of her feelings and
Makoto wasn&#39;t sure how Minako would take the news. Sure some odd
things had happened earlier that day, but she thought it was just Minako
being her bubbly flirtatious self as always. She looked at Minako and
saw her friend giving her puppy dog eyes and she caved.

&quot;All right, I&#39;ll tell you everything. Just, promise me you&#39;ll listen to
everything I say before you say anything back okay?&quot; Minako nodded in
agreement and moved closer to Makoto and took hold of her hand once
again. She could feel Makoto&#39;s hand tremble and when she looked at
her friend she noticed that Makoto looked completely scared. In her
heart Minako hoped that whatever this was about, it would involve
Makoto telling her that she was in love with her.

Makoto began to recall her dream telling Minako about how some man
broke into her apartment and threatened to kill her friend. Minako felt
her heart break as she saw tears coming to Makoto&#39;s eyes again. &quot;It was
so real Minako. I was so scared something would happen to you. I
begged him over and over not to hurt you because I...I could never live
this life without you.&quot; Makoto couldn&#39;t look at Minako anymore scared
of continuing but knowing that she had come to far to turn back on
telling Minako how in love with her she was.

&quot;I saw him cut your throat Minako and I wanted to kill him. I told him
he couldn&#39;t hurt you, because I&#39;m in love with you. But I was helpless.
Then you,&quot; Makoto smiled a bit as she remembered what Minako said
in the dream. &quot;You had to go and be stupid and tell him if he were going
to kill someone to kill you, and leave me alone because, well you told
him you were in love with me. I just was so scared I&#39;d loose you and I&#39;ve
already lost two people I love. I can&#39;t lose you...&quot;

&quot;Baka,&quot; Minako said smiling at Makoto. She reached up to wipe the
tears from Makoto&#39;s face and got Makoto to look into her eyes. &quot;Mako-chan. I&#39;m sorry that dream hurt you so much. But it was a dream, and I
promise you now, that I will never in this life or the next leave you. I
will spend everyday on this earth protecting you and loving you. I&#39;ve
wanted to tell you for so long, but I was to scared. But now you know,
I&#39;m completely in love with you.&quot;

Makoto&#39;s tears began to fall again but this time they weren&#39;t sad tears.
&quot;Hontou?&quot; She asked half scared this was another dream and she&#39;d wake
up crushed.

&quot;I swear to you Mako-chan. I love you.&quot; Minako moved so she was now
sitting on Makoto&#39;s lap, and straddling her waist. The two girls looked
at each other and Makoto wrapped her arms around Minako. Minako,
who was now at eye level with the taller girl brushed her hand across
Makoto&#39;s cheek and leaned forward to kiss her love. For what seemed
like hours the two stayed just like that, holding each other tightly. They
didn&#39;t care if the world around them were to fall apart. As long as they
were together they knew that they could get through anything.

&quot;If only this night never had to end,&quot; Makoto whispered. She looked at
Minako and smiled thankfully.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter anymore Makoto. Because from here on out, the
nights will only get better than the previous ones. Now we can be
together, just like we were meant to be.&quot; Minako got up and motioned
for Makoto to get up as well.

Makoto looked at her slightly confused but she stood up next to
Minako. Minako quickly went to Makoto&#39;s radio and turned on the CD
that was in it. Finding the track that she was looking for she turned the
volume up and walked back over to Makoto. &quot;I heard this song and it
made me think of you. Minako began speaking the words of the song to
Makoto.

&quot;I do swear, that I&#39;ll always be there.
I&#39;d give anything and everything,
And I will always care
Through weakness and strength
Happiness and sorrow
For better or worse
I will love you, with every beat of my heart.&quot;

The song began and the two girls found themselves dancing to the
music. They were completely lost in each other&#146;s eyes as they slowly
moved across the floor singing the song to one another. The song finally
ended and they almost forgot to stop dancing. Minako reluctantly got
out of Makoto&#39;s embrace and went to blow out the various candles
around the apartment. When she was done it was completely dark
except for the moonlight shining in through the windows.

&quot;You know everything in that song Mako-chan. I&#39;ve always wanted to
tell you that. From this moment on, I&#39;ll love you for the rest of eternity.&quot;
Minako looked at Makoto and smiled at her. &quot;Kami-sama. You look so
beautiful in the moonlight.&quot;

&quot;As do you my love,&quot; Makoto said as she happily wrapped her arms
around Minako again.

&quot;Come on, let&#39;s go to bed. I think we&#39;re both exhausted now and I&#39;m
looking forward to the morning.&quot;

&quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot; Makoto asked as they headed towards her bedroom.

&quot;Because ever since I met you I&#39;ve dreamt of waking up in your arms.&quot;
Minako sighed contently as the two crawled into bed. &quot;You&#146;re the one
who&#39;s making all my dreams come true Mako-chan. I never thought my
life could get so perfect.&quot;

&quot;And I never thought I&#39;d find someone who loved me. Especially not
you, the one person that I&#39;m in love with. I always thought it was
impossible for me to be happy but you&#39;ve proven me wrong.&quot; Makoto
wrapped her arms around Minako and held her close. &quot;I feel like
tonight&#39;s the first night my life&#39;s really started since my parents died.
Thank you Minako.&quot;

Minako yawned happily and kissed Makoto. &quot;Anything to make you
happy my love.&quot; And with that all conversation ceased and the two let
themselves fall asleep in the comfort of each other&#146;s arms.
