<h1>Mi Domando Se Li Vedro Ancora (part 14 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/domando-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>The song is called &quot;I Can&#39;t Make You Love Me&quot; sung by Bonnie Raitt. I 
don&#39;t own the song nor Sailor Moon.

Makoto yawned and stretched her aching muscles. Past few days she had 
been getting the work out of her life.

And all of it was occuring in her bed.

Makoto felt a body shift next to her, then warm, gentle hands begin to 
work the knots of her stiff back. Makoto just felt herself begin to mold 
to the matress as her back relaxed.

&quot;You&#39;re very stiff, Mako-chan,&quot; cooed a gentle voice.

&quot;Gee I wonder why?&quot; Makoto smiled and allowed herself to relax more.

&quot;Want I should work on that more?&quot;

Makoto couldn&#39;t help but to smile more. &quot;Mina-chan, you&#39;re the reason my 
back is so stiff and sore.&quot;

Minako giggled, her hands still moving on the taller girl&#39;s shoulders. 
&quot;Complaining?&quot;

&quot;Not at all, tho my back is.&quot; Makoto rolled her shoulders best she could 
and growled softly when Minako began to knead her the muscles in her 
lower back.

Minako smiled and lowered herself onto Makoto slightly, her arms lazily 
draped over Makoto&#39;s shoulders, her face nuzzling the middle of her 
back.

&quot;I just missed you was all. Nearly a month with out you...&quot;

Makoto sighed and rolled over onto her back, Mianko laying her head back 
onto Makoto, this time on her chest. Makoto&#39;s arms wrapped them selves 
around Minako and held her close. &quot;I&#39;ve missed you, too. I just need to 
rest,&quot; Makoto said, whining in a playful way.

Minako giggled and hugged Makoto closer. &quot;Ok, I&#39;ll give you one hour 
with no love making. How&#39;s that,&quot; Minako said teasingly.

Makoto laughed. &quot;How about an hour plus twenty three.&quot;

Minako smiled. &quot;You drive a hard bargain, but deal. I need my Mako-chan 
rested up. &quot; Minako softly kissed Makoto&#39;s cheek and nuzzled her neck.

Makoto smiled and held the blonde closer. Yes, life again was as it 
should be.

&quot;So you&#39;re really going, eh?&quot; Raiga asked. He sat on Ami&#39;s bed in cat 
form next to the suit case that lay open on the girl&#39;s bed.

Ami said nothing as she continued to silently go thru her dresser, 
looking for clothing she would need when she left for Germany in a few 
days.

&quot;I&#39;ll take that as a &#39;yes.&#39;&quot; Raiga sighed and continued to watch the 
girl genuous pack. &quot;Have you told the girls yet?&quot;

&quot;I told Makoto,&quot; Ami said as she laid a few shirts into her suitcase 
neatly.

&quot;What did she say?&quot;

&quot;She didn&#39;t care.&quot;

Raiga stretched and laid down. &quot;No offense, but can you blame her?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want or need a lecture right now,&quot; Ami snapped.

At that Raiga jumped from the bed to the floor and shifted to his human 
form. &quot;No? But you&#39;re about to get one.&quot; He took hold of Ami&#39;s arm, spun 
her around and pushed her back into the chair at her desk.

Ami blinked from surprise. Raiga actually seemed...scary.

&quot;You have been a total brat these past few weeks. And I know why. I 
understand that what happened in the past was hard on you. But you&#39;ve 
been thinking about nothing but yourself. Then and now.

&quot;Did you ever once think of what your actions were doing to Makoto while 
you tried to make your life better?&quot;

Ami was silent. In all honesty, she hadn&#39;t.

Raiga nodded. &quot;Yeah, I thought not.&quot;

Tears silently fell down Ami&#39;s cheeks as her eyes were downcast towards 
the floor. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not the one you should apologize to,&quot; Raiga said sitting back onto 
Ami&#39;s bed, shifting back into his cat form. &quot;You should apologize to 
Makoto and Minako. You&#39;ve hurt them both with your actions.&quot;

Ami nodded silently.

&quot;You should also tell your team mates you&#39;re leaving. You&#39;d want them to 
tell you. It&#39;s only fair.&quot;

Ami nodded once again.

Raiga raised an eye brow. &quot;But the question is will you?&quot;

Ami was silent for a moment. &quot;...No.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t look to me to tell them for you. Because I won&#39;t.&quot;

Ami said nothing as she stood and continued to pack her things.

Raiga continued to watch Ami as she packed her things. &quot;Nothing to say?&quot;

Ami shook her head. &quot;No.&quot;

&quot;And why not?&quot;

Ami sighed as her guardian continued to hound her. &quot;Because I don&#39;t. I 
do not have to explain my actions to you.&quot;

Raiga smirked slightly as if he knew something Ami did not. Ami caught 
the smile, but was too aggrivated to know ask what it meant.

&quot;So...why are we here again,&quot; Makoto asked.

&quot;Usagi said she felt some negative energy here earlier,&quot; Minako said. 
&quot;But she wasn&#39;t sure if it was that or her stomache.&quot;

Makoto looked at the bloned with a raised brow. &quot;Uh...huh. So why are we 
the only two here?&quot;

Minako glanced around the closed ice cream shoppe before she took a hair 
pin from her hair and began to pick the lock. &quot;No point in drawing out 
the whole calvary if it&#39;s a false alarm.&quot;

Makoto nodded. &quot;Good idea.&quot;

Minako picked the lock a few seconds more before a light click was 
heard. &quot;There we go!&quot;

&quot;Where did you learn that anyway,&quot; Makoto asked as she pushed the metal 
door up so she and Minako could walk inside the back of the ice cream 
store.

&quot;Years ago,&quot; Minako answered, pocketing the now bent hair pin. &quot;Some 
things you never forget.&quot;

Makoto lowered the metal door and hit the light switch. The two were 
blinded for only moment from the intense light before their eyes focused 
on large crystals.

&quot;Those are the missing kids!&quot; Minako exclaimed.

Makoto and Minako looked at one another and nodded. As they pulled out 
their transformation pens, they heard a noise and quickly hid. A woman 
walked in wearing the ice cream store&#39;s uniform and glanced around.

&quot;Who&#39;s there!?&quot;

&quot;Going on a trip,&quot; asked the cabbie as Ami walked out of her home. Ami 
only half smiled as the cabbie took the bag from her.

&quot;Sort of,&quot; Ami said as she climbed into the back seat. The cabbie 
nodded, and put the suitcase into the trunk. As the cabbie walked to the 
driver&#39;s side of the car and got into the car, Ami looked up to her 
bedroom window. She saw Raiga, sitting in his human form, watching her 
with his peircing gaze. Ami wasn&#39;t sure, but he looked sad.

&quot;Do you mind if I play the radio,&quot; asked the cabbie, a woman in her mind 
thirties or so. Ami shook her head and the woman switched her radio on. 
A song was just begining and the cabbie looked at Ami thru the rear view 
mirror. &quot;This is a sad song. Pretty, but sad. Mind if I turn it up?&quot; 
Once again, Ami shook her head and listened to the slow song flow from 
the speakers behind her head...

Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me, tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don&#39;t patronize - don&#39;t patronize me

Cause I can&#39;t make you love me if you don&#39;t
You can&#39;t make your heart feel something it won&#39;t
Here in the dark, in these lonely hours
I will lay down my heart and I&#39;ll feel the power
But you won&#39;t, no you won&#39;t
&#39;Cause I can&#39;t make you love me, if you don&#39;t

I&#39;ll close my eyes, then I won&#39;t see
The love you don&#39;t feel when you&#39;re holding me
Morning will come and I&#39;ll do what&#39;s right
Just give me till then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

Cause I can&#39;t make you love me if you don&#39;t
You can&#39;t make your heart feel something it won&#39;t
Here in the dark, in these lonely hours
I will lay down my heart and I&#39;ll feel the power
But you won&#39;t, no you won&#39;t
&#39;Cause I can&#39;t make you love me, if you don&#39;t

&quot;We need help,&quot; Venus cried into her comunicator.

&quot;Whats going on,&quot; Mars asked.

&quot;Makoto couldn&#39;t transform. Something happened and she couldn&#39;t 
transform!&quot; Venus was frantic.

&quot;Is she ok!?&quot;

&quot;Her powers failed and now...&quot;

&quot;WHAT!?&quot;

Venus growled. &quot;Just GET here dammit!&quot;

Ami sat in the terminal, waiting for her plane to board. The song she 
had heard on the cab ride her had started making her think.

She knew what she had done to Makoto was wrong. She had hurt her best 
friend for the sake of her own happiness.

And thinking more about it, she knew she didn&#39;t love Makoto. She was 
nothing more than a convience. Just as she had been one thousand years 
ago.

&quot;They need your help,&quot; said a calm voice. Ami looked up to see Raiga 
standing there, looking out the window, watching the planes take off.

&quot;How do you-&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m from the future, Ami. I know many many things about this time.&quot; He 
looked back at her and his eyes were different.

Ami sat there a moment, then quickly stood. &quot;Where are they?&quot;

The senshi and Makoto sat hunched behind a large piece of equipment, 
trying to shield themselves from the storm of ice and snow the youma was 
blowing at them.

They couldn&#39;t go out there with out knowing exactly where the youma was 
or else they could be turned into human ice-pops.

&quot;Where are you,&quot; called the youma in a chilly voice, much like her 
powers. &quot;You can&#39;t hide forever!&quot;

The doors slammed open at the moment, and there stood Sailor Mercury.

The youma turned and glared at the new rival. &quot;And just who are you?&quot;

Without answering, Mercury yelled out &quot;Shine Aqua Illusion!&quot; and shot 
the youma with a blast of her own medicine.

The youma hit a wall, and Sailor Moon and the others stood from their 
hiding spot.Grabbing her Moon Wand, Sailor Moon yelled out &quot;Moon 
Princess
Halation!&quot;, dusting the youma.

Mercury stood in the door way, watching the others kneal down next to 
Makoto. Sighing, she turned and walked away before anyone could come 
after her.

&quot;You did good tonight,&quot; Raiga said.

Ami looked up from the lake and looked over at Raiga. &quot;How do you always 
know where I am?&quot;

He smiled and leaned against the rail, his arms crossed. &quot;I&#39;m from the 
future. I know things.&quot;

Ami raised her eye brows and looked back over the lake. &quot;I&#39;ve decided 
not to go to Gemany. But you probably already knew that.&quot; Raiga nodded. 
&quot;I&#39;ve also decided to not chase after Makoto anymore. I&#39;ll apologioze to 
both her and Minako next time I see them.&quot; Raiga nodded.

&quot;You&#39;re finally growing up.&quot;

Ami couldn&#39;t hold in her bitter chuckle. &quot;So, tell me future boy, who do 
I end up with?&quot;

Raiga looked at her sideways. &quot;You really want to know?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m alone aren&#39;t I?&quot;

Raiga shook his head. &quot;No, you&#39;re not alone. As a matter of fact, you&#39;re 
married.&quot;

Ami seemed surprised. &quot;Ryo?&quot;

Raiga shook his head. &quot;No.&quot;

Ami was confused now. &quot;Then who is it?&quot;

Raiga turned and smiled at Ami. Before Ami could question him, he bent 
his head down, and softly kissed her.

AN: I&#39;m not sure of Greg&#39;s Japanese name. I&#39;m not sure if its Ryo or 
Urawa, thats why his name is different pending on the story I&#39;m 
writting. If anyone knows for sure, please let me know? Thanks.</pre>
