<h1>Thoughts of Home: The Morning After</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sailordoc.html">Sailor Doc</a><br> </h2>
<pre>*Author&#39;s Note-
This story takes place directly after &#39;The Journey Home&quot;, and like it, 
is set four years into Ami and Makoto&#39;s romantic relationship. You don&#39;t 
have to read that story first, but it may help this one make more 
sense...or not! Chronologically, the series goes in this order:
1--A Picture-Perfect Afternoon
2--The Reckoning
3--The Journey Home
4--The Morning After
_________________________________________________________________ 


The early morning sunlight gently warmed the balcony of her small 
apartment as Makoto enjoyed its warmth, as well as her first cup of tea 
for the day. A smile played across her lips as she leaned on the 
railing, watching the activity on the street below, her thoughts on the 
person still sleeping in their bed.

&#39;Ami&#39;.

The night before had been the second anniversary of their decision to 
live together. Makoto knew without the shadow of a doubt that it had 
been the best decision she had ever been a part of! In a life that could 
never really be considered normal, Ami was the anchor that steadied her. 
Her calm demeanor and steady, steadfast devotion to her beliefs, her 
ideals, and her friends, was a beautiful thing to see, but the 
application of these wonderful traits to the woman she had decided to 
share her life with touched Makoto in ways she still, after all their 
time together, was awed by.

A soft breeze blew across the balcony, ruffling her loosened hair around 
the shoulders of her lacy negligee and cooling the warm skin beneath it. 
She shivered slightly---but not from the sudden chill. A soft moan came 
unbidden to her lips as she closed her eyes and let her memory take her 
back a few hours to the very personal and private celebration of their 
anniversary.

The smell of Ami&#39;s hair...

The feel of her skin, soft as satin as it moved against hers...

The sound of her voice, at times soft and gentle, at others almost 
incoherent as her passion took her beyond words, beyond reasoning 
thought...

The sight of her, eyes closed in ecstacy, her body tense in anticipation 
of her release, then moments later, those self-same eyes filled with a 
love as deep and bottomless as the very blue of them.

The smell of her. Not simply the light perfume she always associated 
with her lover, but of Ami herself. An intoxicating combination of that 
scent, warm, clean skin and her undeniable arousal that never failed to 
go straight to Makoto&#39;s head.

How could she not answer that sirens&#39; call? After all, she was only 
human!

She wondered if Ami knew that all she had to do was crook her little 
finger, and Makoto would move mountains at her slightest whim?

With a wry smile, Makoto lifted the teacup to her lips, then paused as 
the sunlight glittered off the new ring on her finger. The sapphire 
icicles twinked merrily at her from their broad, golden band, not unlike 
the sparkling blue eyes of her lover. With a tender smile, she raised 
her hand to eye level so she could get a closer look at it. As she 
suspected it would be, it was indeed the perfect counterpoint to the 
ring she had given Ami last year. The same wide gold band, but her gift 
had been ringed with emerald lightening bolts. She had never seen it off 
of Ami&#39;s hand, and she silently vowed that her partner would never see 
her wonderful gift separated from her hand either.

With a soft sigh, Makoto took another sip and let her gaze scan the 
rather drab, unremakable buildings across from her. The air was crisp, 
with the heavy tang of moisture that promised a cool, drizzly day. &#39;Just 
the perfect type of day for staying in and cuddling,&#39; she thought to 
herself, extremely happy that it was Saturday, and neither one of them 
had any pressing commitments for the day.

A small sound alerted her to the presence of someone else on their 
balcony just seconds before a pair of arms encircled her waist. Placing 
a hand over them where they crossed at her waist, she grinned as she 
felt the press of her lover&#39;s cheek against the area between her 
shoulder blades and heard Ami sigh as she gently tightened her embrace.

&quot;Good morning, sleepyhead!&quot; she said in greeting. &quot;What&#39;s gotten you up 
so early on a Saturday?&quot;

Snuggling closer, Ami mumbled, &quot;missed you.&quot;

Smiling softly, Makoto said, &quot;Sorry love! You looked so peaceful when I 
got up, I couldn&#39;t bring myself to wake you up. I thought I&#39;d just stir 
around a bit, have a cup of tea, and come back to bed before you woke 
up.&quot;

Feeling Ami nodding against her back, Makoto heard her say again, 
&quot;missed you.&quot;

Laughing, Makoto said, &quot;sweetheart! You&#39;ve already said that! Can&#39;t you 
think of anything else to say this morning?&quot;

Feeling Ami nod again, Makoto heard her say, &quot;cold,&quot; followed by what 
could only be a shiver.

Frowning, Makoto turned her head to the side to look behind at her 
partner.

&quot;Cold? Why are you so cold?&quot;

Turning completely around within Ami&#39;s embrace, Makoto quickly saw the 
reason why.

&quot;Ami! Love?! Are you out of her mind???&quot;

There Ami stood, still half asleep and as naked as the day she was born.

&quot;Missed you,&quot; she said again, her sleepy blue eyes beseeching her lover 
for the warmth she had come in search of.

Pulling the smaller woman into a tight embrace, Makoto tried to share 
her body heat with her shivering mate, vigorously rubbing her arms and 
back.

&quot;Ami,&quot; she laughted, her eyes darting across to the other building and 
back. &quot;What if that old pervert on the fifth floor over there had been 
out with that telescope of his again? We may have found your picture all 
over the internet tonight!&quot; Chuckling, she pulled back a bit to see 
Ami&#39;s eyes. &quot;Are you even awake yet?&quot; At her lover&#39;s nod she smiled and 
added as she shook her head, &quot;What am I ever going to do with you?&quot;

Feeling Ami&#39;s hands begin a slow decent down her back, Makoto started 
coming up with a few ideas of her own before she heard Ami&#39;s voice, 
still raspy with sleep, respond to her question:

&quot;Are you open to suggestions?&quot;

Makoto couldn&#39;t help the shiver that escaped her as Ami&#39;s hands 
continued their journey south, finally reaching their destination and 
pulling Makoto&#39;s warmer form snuggly against her own.

Closing her eyes, Makoto revelled in the feel of Ami&#39;s chilled body 
through the thin material of her nightwear, that same slight chill on 
her fingertips sending shivers of delight racing down her spine. She 
became aware of Ami reaching up on tip-toes and subconsiously leaned 
forward toward her lover, feeling the cold touch of the very tip of 
Ami&#39;s nose against her neck mere seconds before the icy touch of her 
cool lips against the warmth of Makoto&#39;s neck, placing delicate, whisper 
soft kisses against it. Then, the unexpected, welcoming warmth of her 
lover&#39;s mouth as the lobe of her ear found comfort there.

An abrupt, involuntary intake of breath, and Makoto could feel her body 
beginning to reverse the effect. Now, a sudden rush of warmth seemed to 
infuse her from somewhere deep within. Opening her eyes again, she could 
feel them flash with a reawakened desire and an urgent need to share 
that warmth.

Looking up into her lover&#39;s eyes, Ami felt a sudden thrill at what she 
saw there, just before the taller girl pulled her fiercely against her 
deceptively powerful form. Makoto lowered her head, tasting the 
sweetness of Ami&#39;s lips and mouth, drinking deeply of the rare and 
special sustanance she had discovered there, and relishing in the 
knowledge it was for her alone.

Pleasantly shaken by the fervor of Makoto&#39;s assault, Ami was surprised 
when the girl pulled away from her eager lips. Dazed and more than a bit 
confused, she looked up at her lover in silent question. The beautiful 
emerald colored eyes were now a deeper than normal green, seeming to 
crackle and pop with the electricity she wielded so easily. Her intense 
gaze seemed as if it were seeking to capture and entreat the brillant 
young woman all at once.

&quot;Let me be your shelter. Let me be the home that comforts you. Let me be 
the fire that warms you...always.&quot;

Reaching up, her hand trembling with the strength of her own emotions, 
Ami caressed Makoto&#39;s cheek, her eyes following the path of her 
fingertips as she smiled lovingly at their journey; first over the 
cheekbone, then gently following the delicate curve of a reddish brown 
brow, and finally combing through the thick locks of hair she loved so 
much to lightly scratch the scalp beneath. Looking up to meet her 
partners eyes she whispered:

&quot;You. Only you, my love. My home. My heart...always.&quot;

Ami was rewarded with two things, both of which happened rather quickly. 
First was a searing kiss that seemed to totally stop the flow of her 
blood, as her knees went weak and she got light-headed all at the same 
time. Next was a sense of sudden vertigo as the earth seemed to tilt on 
its axis and totally shift beneath her feet. Reluctantly opening her 
eyes, when she realized she wasn&#39;t being kissed anymore, she found 
herself being carried in Makoto&#39;s arms, across the balcony to the french 
doors, a look of serious intent on her face.

&quot;Mako!&quot; she laughted, &quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re cold,&quot; her partner said as she manuvered them through the doors 
and into the warmth of their apartment, not stopping but proceeding with 
determination toward their bedroom. Placing Ami gently back down on the 
bed she said, &quot;I have to do everything I can to protect you from 
becoming ill or hurt, you know.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Ami said, looking up at her partner as Makoto first straightened 
the covers, then pulled them over her not-so-chilled-anymore form and 
tucked them firmly up under her chin. Just a bit disappointed that 
things didn&#39;t seem to be working out exactly as she had originally 
planned them, she added, &quot;So what&#39;s next? Warm tea and homemade soup?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Makoto said, never pausing in her work. Satisfied that Ami was 
properly tucked in, Makoto removed her neglegee, unmindful of its decent 
to the floor. Quickly slipping beneath the covers, she pulled a 
delighted Ami tightly against her larger frame, wrapping her in a living 
blanket of warmth and security.

&quot;Feel better now?&quot; Makoto asked as she held Ami close in her arms.

&quot;Oh yes, much!&quot; Ami responded, burrowing against the solid chest beneath 
her and throughly enjoying the glow of warmth that came from feeling so 
loved and cherished.

&quot;Good,&quot; Makoto replied softly in her love&#39;s ear. &quot;Because it is no 
longer only Sailor Jupiter&#39;s job to protect Sailor Mercury. It is her 
honor and her privilege.&quot;

Smiling tenderly, Ami said, &quot;I love you Makoto! Sometimes the words seem 
so inadequate, but they are no less true...I love you.&quot;

&quot;Ami-love,&quot; Makoto whispered, &quot;my heart.&quot;

For awhile thereafter time seemed to still as they continued the journey 
they had been on the night before. A journey not at all deminished by 
the years they had been traveling it together. A sinuous journey of love 
and devotion, both given and taken...

cherished and shared...

nurtured and nurturing...

and always, always growing.
