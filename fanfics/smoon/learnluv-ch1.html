<h1>Learn to Love</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/adriantymes.html">Adrian Tymes</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Twin melodies sung out from the music room, playfully counterpointing
each other in perfect harmony.  It was difficult to tell whether the
players were reacting to each others&#39; leads, or just following some
ancient score that only seemed to hint of spontaneous tease and desire.
One moment, the violin would lay a series of notes that the pianist had
no choice but to follow; the next, the piano would offer tones that
forced the violinist to shift octaves as fast as her fingers could move.
Despite this give and take, there was not a hint of competition in the
air, but rather the light banter of friends and lovers.

Slowly, hesitantly, a third instrument added itself.  A voice, speaking
in no language but that of pure music, trying to keep up with the piano
and the violin but constantly falling a note or two behind.  The other
melodies compensated briefly, then faded away to let the voice sing
alone for some time before its owner realized she had been abandoned.

Rei opened her eyes, and blushed crimson under Haruka&#39;s and Michiru&#39;s
amused stared.  &quot;Sorry.  I just...it sounded so beautiful, and I wanted
to join in...&quot;

Haruka chuckled.  &quot;What were you singing to, once we weren&#39;t playing?
We&#39;ve never played that for anyone but each other.&quot;

&quot;I...well, I...are you sure you&#39;ve never played it?  Near the end, I
could almost swear I&#39;d heard that tune before.&quot;

&quot;Not from us.  I&#39;ve only heard it in my heart, and from my heart.&quot;
Michiru set her instrument down, and looped one arm around Haruka.
&quot;Maybe your heart carries the same song?&quot;

Rei&#39;s lips smiled, but her eyes failed to follow suit.

&quot;But that is not why you are here.  Tell me, what brings you to our home
this morning?&quot;

&quot;I...err, that is...&quot;  Rei glanced at her toes.  &quot;Usagineedshelp.&quot;

Michiru slid her arm off of Haruka, letting her partner stand up.  &quot;Is
Princess Serenity in danger?&quot;

Rei snapped out of her trance.  &quot;What?  Oh, no, nothing like that.&quot;

Both outer senshi relaxed.  &quot;Then, what is the problem?&quot;

&quot;Well...she...&quot;  Rei took a deep breath and closed her eyes.
&quot;Yesterday, Usagi came to me and asked me to teach her how to make love.
I told her I was busy, but in truth, I didn&#39;t know myself.  I told her
to come back tonight, and I was hoping you could teach me before then.&quot;

Michiru raised an eyebrow.  &quot;I see.  Why us, and not any of the others?
You know Ami, Minako, and Makoto better than you know us.&quot;

&quot;Yes, but Usagi thought they could only teach her how to have sex...that
they&#39;d miss the spiritual aspect that makes sex different than love.
That&#39;s why she came to me...and, frankly, I agree with her.  Setsuna&#39;s
not easy to find, and Hotaru is...well...young.&quot;

Haruka chuckled.  &quot;Hotaru isn&#39;t as young as you might think.&quot;

&quot;Even so,&quot; Michiru continued, &quot;we will help you.&quot;

Rei&#39;s eyes snapped open.  &quot;You will?&quot;

&quot;Yes.  We will show you what it is like to be made love to, that you may
pass this knowledge on to Usagi.&quot;

Rei&#39;s eyes opened further, but her heart caught in her throat, making
speech impossible.  She stood, like a deer caught in headlights, while
Haruka and Michiru approached.

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid, dear Rei,&quot; Michiru whispered in her ear before licking
it.  &quot;If you fear, you will not learn.&quot;

Despite the advice, Rei&#39;s mind locked itself in a state of shock as
Haruka slowly but surely unbuttoned Rei&#39;s blouse and eased it off of
her, sensuously caressing Rei&#39;s arms as she guided the garment off.
Michiru stroked Rei&#39;s hair and massaged Rei&#39;s shoulders while Haruka
removed the rest of Rei&#39;s clothing.

She came out of it with a gasp when Haruka nibbled her right breast.  As
she became aware of herself again, she felt her tension drain away into
Michiru&#39;s persistent rubs and kisses all over her upper body.  She
instinctively tried to stiffen again when Haruka&#39;s mouth descended
towards her nether regions, but Michiru would not allow it.  Haruka
paused at her belly button, then slid down until Haruka&#39;s jaw brushed
her clitoris.  After kissing just above that spot as if afraid to go
lower without tactile proof of the feature&#39;s existence, Haruka licked,
then nibbled, then sucked on the protrusion before sliding down even
further.

And then she was in.

Rei had never had anything, even her own fingers, inside her vagina
before.  Haruka&#39;s rough tongue sent jolts of pleasure wherever it
wagged, finally overcoming her reluctance-

&quot;Papa?  Mama?  What are you doing to Rei?&quot;

Three pairs of eyes turned towards Hotaru, who returned their surprise
with neutral curiosity.

Rei spoke first.  &quot;It&#39;s not what it looks like...&quot;

&quot;Actually, it is.&quot;  Michiru smiled.  &quot;We were meaning to tell you about
this soon, and now is a perfect opportunity.&quot;

&quot;You mean, Rei&#39;s going to be my mama too?&quot;

Michiru blinked.  &quot;No...why do you say that?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve only seen papa do that to you, mama.  I thought papa was trying to
make Rei another mama.  Didn&#39;t papa do that to Setsuna to make her a
mama?&quot;

Haruka flushed.  &quot;No, no.  What we were doing was showing Rei what two
adults do when they want to please each other.&quot;

Rei was stiff again.  &quot;You&#39;ve...seen them?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yeah.  Mama and papa do that every-&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s enough, Hotaru.&quot;  Michiru, while not showing as many symptoms as
Rei, was just as surprised.  &quot;Listen, we&#39;ve been trying to teach Rei, so
she can pass on the knowledge.  Would you like to help Rei practice?&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot;  Hotaru advanced on Rei, taking her hand and guiding her to the
floor.  After turning Rei face up and climbing on top of the still-
stunned senshi, Hotaru plunged face first into the same crevice Haruka
had explored only minutes earlier.

The new attack felt identical to Haruka&#39;s, although more exaggerated and
enthusiastic.  Rei quickly regained her mind under Hotaru&#39;s
ministrations, and saw her new partner&#39;s rear end wiggling over her
breasts as Hotaru put her entire body into her labors.

*Practice?  Ok...*

Suddenly, Rei grabbed Hotaru and pulled the smaller one up her body.
Before Hotaru could protest, Rei flipped up Hotaru&#39;s skirt, pushed aside
Hotaru&#39;s panties with her fingers, and started her own assault on
Hotaru&#39;s crotch.

Hotaru gasped in pleasure, and squeezed her legs around Rei&#39;s neck.
Again putting her entire body into the act, she tried to pump Rei&#39;s
tongue, as if it were the sex organ of the opposite gender.

Rei lost track of time, only noticing when Hotaru finally reached up
with her hands and started using her fingers to pleasure Rei where her
mouth could no longer reach.  All too soon, though, Haruka and Michiru
pulled Hotaru off.

&quot;Hotaru, just how long have you been watching us?  You&#39;ve done
everything we did a year ago.&quot;

&quot;Well...you never said I couldn&#39;t watch...&quot;

&quot;The door was closed.&quot;

&quot;The keyhole wasn&#39;t.  And the door was not always closed.&quot;

Rei lay perfectly still, aware of her own body like she had never been
before, as the family&#39;s discussion faded into the distance as they
walked away.

&quot;Rei?&quot;

She gulped.  Her senses had been too self-oriented just then; she had
not even heard the newcomer approach.  &quot;Ami?&quot;

&quot;What do you mean, I don&#39;t know the difference between sex and love?  Of
course I know the difference.&quot;

&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;I was tutoring Hotaru when you walked in.  We could not help but hear
your discussion.  When we saw what was happening, I stayed out of
sight.&quot;

&quot;You watched us?&quot;

&quot;I was curious.  You&#39;ve never had sex, have you?&quot;

Rei blinked.  &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;

&quot;It didn&#39;t look like it.  Look, I don&#39;t know what you meant by my not
knowing how to make love, but I do know that sex is part of it.  If you
want to teach Usagi, you&#39;ll have to know some techniques.&quot;

&quot;Look, Ami, I-YI!&quot;

Fireworks of pleasure went off in response to Ami&#39;s quick movements.
The senshi of ice touched many specific points in rapid succession,
leaving Rei with no choice but to let it happen.

&quot;And don&#39;t forget here, and here, and...you really are a virgin.  I&#39;ll
have to get rid of your hymen, hold on...&quot;

&quot;What do you AYP!&quot;  Pain abruptly mixed with her other sensations.  Part
of Rei&#39;s mind tried to track Ami&#39;s gestures, recording every single
nerve she touched, but it was too much, too fast.

&quot;...and there, and there.  Now, that&#39;s just for starters, but it will do
for now.  Remember them for Usagi, ok?  I&#39;d better rescue Hotaru from
the inquisition now.&quot;  Although her eyes never looked in Ami&#39;s
direction, Rei did hear her leave.

Minutes later, Rei caught her breath enough to sit up.  Still in a
mental fog and halfway to orgasm, she absently noted a small puddle of
her own juices and blood that had collected on the floor near her
vagina.  She only stood up when a hand came out of nowhere to help her
up.

&quot;Hello, Rei.&quot;

&quot;Setsuna?  I know you&#39;re not supposed to abuse your powers over time,
but I think these two questions are very important to the time stream.
One: is anybody else watching that I don&#39;t know about?&quot;

&quot;No.  We are alone, for the moment.&quot;

&quot;Two: What happened to the shy and reserved Ami I knew?&quot;

&quot;She is reserved about expressing her emotions.  Mechanical help is
different in her mind.  Has she ever been shy in helping you with math
homework?&quot;

&quot;Making love is not math.&quot;

&quot;Would you honestly call what she just did &#39;making love&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Point taken.&quot;

&quot;One day, under your guidance, Ami will discover the true power of love,
instead of constantly hiding from it.  When that happens, she will
become a warrior without equal...for a while.  But that is a story for
another time.  Tonight will be a very important night for Usagi, and
despite what you think, Minako and Makoto can help you prepare for it.&quot;

Rei thought she asked &quot;How?&quot;, but never heard her own voice as she was
sucked through Pluto&#39;s time gate.

******

She instantly recognized Makoto&#39;s apartment on landing, and from the
clock on the wall, realized that Pluto had sent her forward six hours.
She also noticed that Pluto had forgotten to send Rei&#39;s clothes with
her.

Rei thought she heard a dog lapping up water in the apartment.
Distinctly aware that Makoto kept no pets, she tiptoed towards the
source, wondering if it was Luna or Artemis.

Makoto lay spaced out and half undressed on her bed, while Minako ground
a dildo into her vagina with exaggerated caution, licking the device and
her flesh every so often, while tracing an intricate pattern on her
upper torso with one hand.  Neither one seemed aware of Rei&#39;s presence,
even though she was in both of their fields of view.

As Rei entered the room, she heard occasional whimpers and soft moans
from Makoto&#39;s throat.  This, above all, went against what little she had
gleaned about sex from accidentally seeing pieces of her grandfather&#39;s
videos: although Makoto seemed to be intensely enjoying Minako&#39;s
attentions, Makoto seemed to feel no need to let Minako know.

Before long, Makoto stiffened, jerked a few times, groaned loudly once,
then went limp.  Her eyes closed during the process, then slowly opened
- then snapped wide open.  &quot;REI?!?  Wh...How did you get in?&quot;

Rei abruptly became aware of her own presence.  &quot;Pluto let me in, and
she didn&#39;t use the door.&quot;

&quot;I...that is...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t tell anyone.&quot;

Makoto let out a breath.  &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;But I don&#39;t think you have to worry about it.  The others would never
hold it against you.  Anyway, Pluto said you could help me GYA!&quot;  She
stumbled and fell forward, landing torso first next to Makoto, when
Minako inserted the dildo into her.

&quot;Minako!&quot;

&quot;No, that&#39;s okay.  This UNH is what I needed...&quot;

Makoto cocked her head and looked at Rei.

&quot;Long story.  Tell you more later.  Just...don&#39;t...stop...&quot;

Shrugging at the promise of an explanation, Makoto began tracing the
curves of Rei&#39;s body, feeling Rei&#39;s goose bumps every time Minako&#39;s toy
pushed especially deep into Rei.

Once again, Rei lost track of time, losing herself instead to pleasure.
She responded unconditionally to her friends, latching on to whatever
part of Minako&#39;s body presented itself after Minako and Makoto traded
positions.

However, no matter how much the others responded to her, something
within Rei snagged, sticking her joy to a certain plateau.  Every time
she tried to will herself to greater heights, a reservation near the
heart of her inner fire kept her from ascending.  Her heart pleaded to
be with...who?  What little concentration Rei had, went in circles
trying to answer that question.  It was driving her crazy, even more so
than her friends&#39; attentions.

&quot;Ahem.&quot;  All three looked up when Setsuna interrupted their proceedings.
&quot;Much as I hate to interrupt, Rei, you were sent here to learn.  Look at
the clock.&quot;

Rei did as requested, and gasped.  &quot;It&#39;s eleven o&#39; clock!  Usagi&#39;s been
waiting for me for hours!&quot;

&quot;Do not worry.  Remember, time is my servant.  But, what you needed here
was an object lesson.  How many times have you come?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

Makoto blinked.  &quot;I was wondering about that.  I thought I would have
felt it if you had, but I haven&#39;t felt anything.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s...&#39;come&#39;?&quot;

Setsuna smiled.  &quot;Stand up and come here.  Now, close your eyes, and
imagine I am Usagi.&quot;

&quot;Pardon?&quot;

Setsuna pulled Rei off the bed, into a standing position.  &quot;Close your
eyes, and think of me as Usagi.&quot;

Rei lowered her eyelids, switching her vision to her mind&#39;s eye.

&quot;Rei.&quot;

Rei intellectually knew it was Setsuna&#39;s voice copying Usagi&#39;s, and
doing a good job.  But her heart desired more.  

Open lips brushed hers...and Rei found herself kissing back with all the
passion she could muster.  Hidden desire welled to the surface, locking
Rei&#39;s mind in her own brain, only feeling, hearing, and tasting as her
body responded.  A finger brushed across her juice-slick vagina, and
Rei&#39;s reservation melted into sheer, obedient, orgasmic bliss.

When it was over, Rei sagged in Setsuna&#39;s grip.  &quot;What...was...that?&quot;
she panted.

&quot;All you needed to know.  Get dressed, then I shall send you back to
your temple, early enough that you can think of your answer before Usagi
arrives.&quot;

******

Rei concentrated on the sacred fire, desperately seeking enlightenment.
Usagi was due any second, and still her answer had not come.

Once again, she pondered Setsuna&#39;s &quot;lesson&quot;.  The only one she had ever
loved that way was Mamoru, but he was Usagi&#39;s now, not hers.  It shamed
her to even think that she might still love him in the same way.  Her
mind knew it would be wrong to ask Usagi to share him...so why did her
heart disagree?  If nothing else, Usagi would be jealous, to the point
that it might ruin their friendship.

On time for once, Usagi quietly slid open the wood and paper door,
slipped inside, and shut the door.  Out of the corner of her eye, Rei
saw that Usagi was wearing a kimono and socks, and, as revealed when
Usagi began to untie the kimono, nothing underneath.

&quot;Usagi.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m ready, Rei.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t.  PLEASE.&quot;

Usagi blinked.  &quot;Rei?&quot;

&quot;I...this isn&#39;t something you should do with just anyone.  Not even just
your friends.  Please, Usagi, don&#39;t spoil your first time.&quot;

&quot;But, Rei...&quot;

&quot;You wanted me to let you know how to make love?  You&#39;re right, any of
the others can tell you how to have sex.  To make love, do it with one
you love.  And...just be yourself.&quot;

&quot;I will, Rei.&quot;

&quot;Good.  Now, go on.  Go to the one you love.&quot;

Usagi&#39;s kimono dropped to the floor.

And Rei knew, for the first time, just how wrong was her assumption that
Usagi would be jealous of her love for Mamoru.  And for Usagi.</pre>
