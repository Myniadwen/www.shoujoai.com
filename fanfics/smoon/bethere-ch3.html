<h1>Will You Be There? (part 3 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/meikosama.html">Azfixiation</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/bethere-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>After of sitting on the same chair in the same position for a few hours
Makoto&#39;s muscles began to ache. She also noticed the increasing
grumble in her stomach. She didn&#39;t want to leave from her spot near
Minako&#39;s room but she knew that Minako would yell at her for not
taking care of herself if she were awake. The thought of Minako yelling
at her brought a smile to Makoto&#39;s face. Just the thought of hearing
Minako&#39;s voice did.

Even though she received some eerie stares from Mrs. Aino, Makoto
stood up and looked through the window into Minako&#39;s room. She
didn&#39;t really like the fact that people could just walk by and look in on
Minako but when she thought about Mrs. Aino standing there like a
watch dog people probably didn&#39;t look in. She held her hand to the glass
and whispered, &quot;I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; to Minako.

She walked through the hospital looking for a snack machine while
trying to get the knots out of her muscles. She could hardly wait for
Minako to be released from the hospital so she could finally get a good
night&#146;s rest. She finally found the snack machines and got a small bag
of chips and a coke to go with it and quickly returned back to her spot
by Minako&#39;s room.

The first thing she noticed was that Mrs. Aino had disappeared back
into Minako&#39;s room. She set her food down on a small table next to the
stuffed Togepi she brought and walked up to the window to look in
Minako&#39;s room. What she saw brought tears to her eyes once again.
While Minako&#39;s eyes weren&#39;t opened she saw Minako&#39;s mouth moving.
Her first instinct was to run into the room and embrace her love but she
knew with Mrs. Aino in there that wasn&#39;t possible. She would only get
yelled at and kicked out of the room. Instead she went in search of Dr.
Mizuno to ask for her help while wondering what Minako was talking
about with her mom.

_____

&quot;Where&#39;s Mako-chan?&quot; Minako kept repeating frustrating her mother.

&quot;She&#39;s not here,&quot; her mother lied to her. She knew Minako was to tired
to open her eyes still and if she couldn&#39;t see Makoto she never had to
know. &quot;Besides, your not allowed to see her anymore. Look what she let
happen to you.&quot; Mrs. Aino took hold of her daughter&#146;s hand. &quot;You don&#39;t
need friends like that Minako.&quot;

&quot;I do...I need her...&quot; Minako said softly finding it hard to talk.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about that now. Just rest okay?&quot; Mrs. Aino looked to the
window and was relieved that Makoto wasn&#39;t looking in on them. She
held onto Minako&#39;s hand firmly trying not to upset her daughter.

&quot;Makoto...&quot; Minako whispered sadly. Before anything else could be
said there was a faint knock on the door. Minako managed to open her
eyes briefly and was sad when she realized it wasn&#39;t Makoto but Mrs.
Mizuno instead.

&quot;How are you feeling Minako?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m okay I guess even though my whole body aches and I can&#39;t seem to
keep my eyes open.&quot;

&quot;All you need is to rest,&quot; Mrs. Mizuno reassured her. &quot;By tomorrow
you&#39;ll be feeling much better. Anyways, the reason I came in here is
because I need to go over some things with you Mrs. Aino. Could you
please come to my office with me for a few minutes?&quot;

Minako&#39;s mothers eyes narrowed but she reluctantly complied with the
doctor. &quot;I&#39;ll be right back Minako.&quot; She released her hold on Minako&#39;s
hand and the two stepped out of Minako&#39;s room. After Mrs. Aino took a
good look around to make sure Makoto was no where in sight she
followed Mrs. Mizuno to her office on the next floor up. Makoto, who
was hiding around the corner saw the two leaving and watched as Mrs.
Mizuno cleverly stick her hand out holding out all five fingers, telling
Makoto she had exactly five minutes with Minako.

&quot;I&#39;ve gotta tell Ami-chan how cool her mom is when I see her.&quot; Makoto
said to herself as she grabbed the Togepi doll off the table. She quietly
entered Minako&#39;s room not sure if she was asleep or awake.

&quot;Mom?&quot; Minako asked softly.

At that moment Makoto felt as if a large weight had been lifted off her
chest. She didn&#39;t say anything at first to Minako but walked to her
bedside and took hold of her hand and kissed it. &quot;No,&quot; was all she said.

&quot;Mako-chan? I thought you weren&#39;t here. My mom said..&quot; Minako
trailed off. &quot;I should have known she was lying to me.&quot;

&quot;I only have five minutes Minako. Mrs. Mizuno&#39;s doing me a huge favor
here. She knows as long as your mom&#39;s around I won&#39;t be able to get in
here so I have to make this quick. Here, I brought you something.&quot;
Makoto said handing Minako her Togepi. &quot;I thought he might cheer you
up some while you&#146;re in here.&quot;

&quot;Oh Makoto. If I had more energy I&#39;d hug you now and never let go.&quot;
Minako said forcing herself to open her eyes briefly.

&quot;You don&#39;t hate me for not being able to protect you, do you?&quot; Makoto
asked scared to hear the answer. Minako&#39;s faint laughter way the last
thing she expected to hear.

&quot;No you big doof, I love you for saving me.&quot; Minako joked. &quot;Now do I
get a kiss or what?&quot; she asked half seriously thinking Makoto wouldn&#39;t
want to kiss her while she looked so crappy.

&quot;I thought you&#39;d never ask,&quot; Makoto said as she lowered her lips to
Minako&#39;s. Their kiss seemed to heal both of them completely. Their
bodies were both still weak, Minako&#146;s from the physical abuse and
Makoto&#146;s from the stress but their hearts, their emotions, were finally
calmed. &quot;I have to go now before your mother gets back. If she sees me
in here I&#39;ll be kicked out of the hospital since I&#39;m not immediate family.
But I&#39;ll be waiting outside to sneak in here every chance I get. Your
mom&#39;s going to have to eat sometime and when she leaves I&#39;ll sneak back
in. I love you.&quot;

&quot;I love you too Makoto.&quot; Minako smiled even though she was sad that
she was stuck with her mother when the only person she wanted to be
with had to wait outside. Makoto knew exactly what Minako was
thinking and bent down to kiss her once more. &quot;I&#39;m going to call the
others and tell them your awake. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be relieved.&#148;

&quot;Tell them I said hi please? And try not to miss me too much. I heard I&#39;ll
be out of here in a few days then nothing will keep us apart.&quot; Minako
said cheerfully. &quot;I can&#39;t wait for us to be able to start our new life
together Makoto.&quot;

&quot;Neither can I. I just hope we can deal with your mother.&quot; Makoto stood
up and ran her fingers through Minako&#39;s hair. &quot;Even like this your
beautiful to me,&quot; she said as she left Minako&#39;s room reluctantly. Minako
just sighed to herself and held onto her Togepi. She decided to hide it
under the blankets so her mom wouldn&#39;t notice Makoto had been in
there. Realizing there was nothing she could do until she was well
enough to at least open her eyes and move around Minako let herself
fall asleep while thinking of Makoto.

Makoto noticed she left Minako&#39;s room just in the nick of time as Mrs.
Aino walked past her. Letting out a sigh of relief, Makoto decided it
was time to tell the others Minako had woken up. When she reached in
her pockets she realized she used all her change for snacks earlier. She
grabbed her communicator and before calling the others on it she got a
great idea.

&quot;Dr. Mizuno,&quot; Makoto said as she found Ami&#39;s mom doing her rounds
in the hospital. &quot;If Minako happens to ask where I am, tell her I&#39;ll be
right back please?&quot; Makoto asked not wanting to waste any time. Dr.
Mizuno agreed and Makoto quickly ran out of the hospital. She decided
to stop by Usagi&#39;s house first to tell her about Minako being awake
before she would carry out her plan. Luckily she found that Rei and
Ami were at Usagi&#39;s too.

&quot;You&#146;re looking good,&quot; Rei commented Makoto once she was led to
Usagi&#39;s room.

&quot;Un, and I owe it all to your mom Ami.&quot; Makoto looked over at the blue
haired genius. &quot;I want to do something for her to pay her back one day.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;d she do?&quot; Usagi asked confused.

&quot;Well she distracted that evil Mrs. Aino so I could sneak into Minako&#39;s
room and talk to her for a few minutes.&quot; Makoto said cheerfully.

&quot;Talk? As in she&#39;s,&quot; Rei started but Makoto added the &#39;awake&#39; part for
her. She was full of excitement now that her love was awake and
couldn&#39;t wait to get back to the hospital. &quot;That&#39;s so great Mako-chan,&quot;
Rei hugged Makoto.

&quot;Yeah, you should come visit her sometime. I know she&#39;d love that. But
I gotta go, I was just wondering, is Artemis here by chance?&quot;

&quot;No, he&#39;s still at Minako&#39;s...probably worrying to death about her.
Why?&quot; Usagi was confused once again.

&#147;No time to explain; I gotta get back before Minako wakes up.&#148; Makoto
stood up and said her goodbyes leaving behind several confused senshi.
Once she was out of Usagi&#39;s front door she ran as fast as she could to
Minako&#39;s not wanting to waste even a second. She finally got there and
knocked on the door as hard as she could. When she saw a small white
cat pop up in the window she felt incredibly relieved.

Artemis saw her and was worried that something may have happened to
Minako. He ran outside, getting out of the house by the small hole in
the back door that was made for him. &quot;Is she okay?&quot; he immediately
asked worried.

&quot;She&#39;s fine, couldn&#39;t be better,&quot; Makoto said as she bent down to pat the
top of his head. &quot;I just need you to do me a little favor.&quot;

&quot;I need her communicator, and I can&#39;t get into the house, so I was
thinking maybe you&#39;d be super nice and get it for me?&quot; Makoto said
giving Artemis her best puppy dog eyes. She knew the guardian cat
would be against using the communicators unless it was senshi
business, but it was the only way Makoto could think of to get to talk to
Minako since Mrs. Aino wouldn&#39;t let her in Minako&#39;s room.

Artemis knew if Luna found out he was helping Makoto with this crazy
scheme he&#39;d never hear the end of it, but there was no way he could say
no to those puppy dog eyes of Makoto&#39;s. He ran inside and searched for
Minako&#39;s communicator. Once he found it he picked it up in his mouth
and carried it to Makoto. &quot;Don&#39;t let Luna find out about this,&quot; he said as
Makoto took the communicator.

&quot;Arigatou!&quot; Makoto said as she started on her way back to the hospital.
She couldn&#39;t believe how good she felt at the moment and almost felt
like screaming. &quot;I&#39;ve figured it out Minako, I just hope your awake when
I get back,&quot; Makoto thought to herself.

Once she did reach the hospital, she was happy to find Minako awake,
even though Mrs. Aino was in there with her. Makoto smiled happily as
she saw that this time Minako had her eyes open and another idea came
to mind. She walked over to the nurse&#146;s station and asked for a piece of
paper and a pen. She scribbled something down and headed towards
Minako&#39;s room trying to think of a way to get her attention, without
Mrs. Aino noticing.

Her first instinct was to tap on the glass but she knew Mrs. Aino would
hear that as well as Minako so she decided to settle for flailing her arms
about hoping Minako would notice eventually. After a while her arms
got tired and she felt ridiculous thanks to the odd looks from several
people but she didn&#39;t give up. Eventually Minako did notice and
Makoto quickly placed the piece of paper that she wrote on against the
glass. It took Minako&#39;s eyes a few seconds to focus on the writing that
simply said &quot;I love you,&quot; since she was still very tired but when she read
it she got the urge to jump out of bed and run to Makoto.

Finally Mrs. Aino caught on to the fact that her daughter was starting a
little too intently so she turned around to see who was at the window.
When she saw Makoto she instantly saw red but tried to stay calm.
Makoto did her best to look innocent and Minako could only giggle at
the silly expression on Makoto&#39;s face. Makoto noticed Dr. Mizuno
coming to check up on Minako and stopped her in the hall. &quot;I&#39;m sorry
Mrs. Mizuno but I have one last favor to ask of you, but I promise I&#39;ll
make it up to you somehow.&quot; Makoto began.

&quot;And what is it this time?&quot; the older woman questioned.

&quot;Could you just give this to Minako for me since I&#39;m not allowed in her
room?&quot; Makoto asked as she grabbed Minako&#39;s communicator from her
pocket. Makoto knew she was taking a big risk letting someone see
their communicators but it was the only way, and she&#39;d gladly take the
punishment if something came from it. Luckily for her Dr. Mizuno
didn&#39;t ask any questions and agreed.

&quot;You know, it&#39;s getting late now and visiting hours are almost over. You
should probably go home and get some rest.&quot;

&quot;I will, but I wanna go say bye to Minako first.&quot; Makoto and Dr.
Mizuno began to walk to Minako&#39;s room. Makoto watched as the doctor
went in and she noticed that Dr. Mizuno pointed to her so Minako
knew she was trying to get her attention. &quot;I love you,&quot; Makoto mouthed
to the blonde. Minako in turn mouthed the words back making sure that
her mom couldn&#39;t tell what she was saying. They waved to one another
and Makoto went home hoping her plan would work.

Dr. Mizuno found that she was having an increasingly difficult time
explaining to Mrs. Aino that once visiting hours were over she had to
leave. Mrs. Aino fought back saying that since she was Minako&#39;s mother
that shouldn&#39;t apply to her, but once Dr. Mizuno explained that Makoto
had already left to go home for the night Mrs. Aino agreed to leave. 
Once the coast was clear Dr. Mizuno slipped Minako her
communicator. &quot;I don&#39;t know why, but Makoto asked me to give this
thing to you so here.&quot;

Minako&#39;s smile seemed to grow ten times larger as she thanked her
doctor. &quot;Oh, and if your good tomorrow, we might let you out of here by
the evening.&quot;

&quot;Are you serious? Hey, what if you don&#39;t tell my mom and I just sneak
out of here with Makoto?&quot; Minako asked with a hopeful gleam in her
eyes. Dr. Mizuno only laughed and told her to get some sleep so she&#39;d
be well enough to walk around the next day. Minako nodded and said
goodnight as Dr. Mizuno left. As soon as she was completely alone she
grabbed the Togepi from under her covers and squeezed its palm. She
laughed as the little doll wiggled and cheerfully called its name out.
Finally she decided it was time to call her girlfriend on her
communicator.

When she saw Makoto&#39;s face show up on the screen she thought she&#39;d
die of joy. &quot;Miss me?&quot; she asked softly.

&quot;You know I did baby, why do you think I went through so much
trouble to get that damn thing to you?&quot;

&quot;And just how did you get my communicator?&quot; Minako asked as she
accidentally caused her Togepi to speak. She laughed a little and did her
best Togepi imitation. Finally she retuned her attention to Makoto who
was just looking at Minako&#39;s image on the communicator lovingly. &quot;So
how&#39;d you get my communicator?&quot; Minako asked once more.

&quot;Well I just figured since they had you in those nasty hospital clothes
your mom must have taken your stuff home so I went there while you
were sleeping today and talked Artemis into getting it for me.&quot;

&quot;Artemis actually agreed? Are you serious?&quot; Minako could hardly
believe what she was hearing.

&quot;Yeah he did, but only cuz I weakened him with my puppy dog eyes.&quot;
Makoto laughed remembering that. &quot;He&#39;s been really worried about you
too.&quot;

&quot;I really miss him. But Dr. Mizuno said I might be able to get out of
here by tomorrow night if I get some of my strength back.&quot;

&quot;Hontou? That&#39;s awesome!&quot; Makoto said cheerfully. &quot;You should go to
sleep and get some rest then.&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;ve missed you so much! I don&#39;t want to stop talking to you and
it&#146;s hard to sleep without you next to me.&quot; Minako said quietly.

&quot;Believe me I know. This is only my second night without you but it
feels as if it&#39;s been an eternity. I want to be able to hold you so bad. We
haven&#39;t even been able to fully enjoy our new relationship yet. There are
so many things I look forward to, but I know we have the rest of eternity
together so one more night doesn&#39;t seem too bad.&quot;

Minako felt herself wanting to cry at how sweet Makoto was being to
her. &quot;I love you Makoto.&quot;

&quot;I love you too Minako, and tomorrow we&#39;ll figure out some way to be
together, I promise. But until then you need to get some sleep and get
your strength back up. I know you heal faster since you&#146;re a senshi, but
you took a bad beating and need to rest. I&#39;ll be at the hospital as soon as
I wake up I promise.&quot; Makoto smiled at her girlfriend through the
communicator.

&quot;Promise eh? Well then I guess I&#39;ll see you in the morning. But until
then I&#39;ll be dreaming about you my love,&quot; Minako said as she wished
more than anything that the Togepi doll in her arms was Makoto.

&quot;Goodnight Minako...I love you.&quot; Makoto said and quickly shut her
communicator off while she had the guts to do so. She laid down in bed
and shut her eyes while visions of waking up with Minako in her arms
flooded into her mind. She sighed contently and without even changing
into pajamas lay on the bed exhausted from the last few days and
knowing that she had a big day in front of her. She had no idea how
she&#39;d get Mrs. Aino to let Minako stay with her but somehow it had to
be done, and she would do it...She would do anything for Minako. And
with that in mind she fell to sleep looking forward to seeing her blonde
goddess in the morning...
