******

Sailor Mars&#39; eyes darted warily around the office building&#39;s spacious 
and nicely, but sparingly, decorated lobby. Pitch-black shadows in the 
lightless room stretched out ominously from all angles, appearing to 
reach out for the miko and her companions with long bony claws, creating 
a darkly foreboding atmosphere. Mars&#39; footsteps echoed eerily around the 
lobby as she followed behind her fellow Sailor Senshi with Sailor Moon 
sticking close to her side. Her heartbeat was increasing steadily in her 
chest as the tension in the air got to her, and she felt her hands start 
to sweat in her gloves in anxious anticipation.

&quot;They could have at least left a light on for us...&quot; Sailor Venus 
commented in a nervously quiet voice as she looked around the large 
room, checking for hidden attackers.

&quot;These youma don&#39;t fight that way,&quot; Sailor Mars said just as quietly. 
Her brow creased as she felt a brief icy cold sliver of something on her 
alert preternatural senses, spurring the miko to quickly move her gaze 
about her surroundings, her lavender eyes straining as she tried to will 
them to burn through the darkness in the shadows around her, searching 
for any possible threats. Mars just knew that Lazarus would bring his 
buddies with similar fashion sense along to help him out. Why else would 
he be unconcerned if she brought her friends? She expected no less of a 
despicable youma.

Sailor Mercury turned her head to Sailor Mars. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; she 
asked curiously.

&quot;They hold a special affinity for the dark,&quot; Mars replied in an absent 
mumble as she continued her vigilant survey of the area.

&quot;Like the youma that attacked Minato General Hospital?&quot; Sailor Neptune 
said from behind the two Inner Senshi. She shivered slightly at the 
memory, no doubt recalling the knife that had been held to her throat. 
&quot;This should be interesting...&quot;

&quot;Not the words I would have used...&quot; Sailor Moon said uneasily from 
beside Sailor Mars. The blonde&#146;s somewhat frightened blue eyes 
apprehensively scanned the deepest shadows of the lobby, as if she 
expected any number of youma assassins to materialise out of nowhere at 
any second. She may have not been far wrong.

&quot;I suppose it is only natural that this, &#39;Lazarus&#39;, would bring his 
cronies along to help out,&quot; Mercury said. &quot;You did say he just appeared 
at the Hikawa Jinja, like the other youma did at the hospital, correct 
Mars?&quot;

Just as Sailor Mars opened her mouth to reply, her senses were suddenly 
inundated with the detection of a huge number of inhuman presences, the 
company of many twisted creatures registering like multiple glaring red 
lights in the part of her mind attuned to the malevolent and unnatural.

&quot;Watch out!&quot; Sailor Mars yelled as she threw her arm out to the side, 
blocking Sailor Moon from walking any further and pushing her princess 
back, just as a barbed arrow slammed into the tiled floor by the 
blonde&#39;s feet, taking out several chunks of grey stone to scatter into 
the air.

&quot;Take cover!&quot; Tuxedo Kamen shouted as a great deal more arrows, coming 
from many different directions, swiftly joined the first arrow quivering 
in the floor.

Sailor Mars grabbed Sailor Moon&#39;s arm and then bolted to her left, 
heading straight for the arrangement of couches and armchairs around the 
coffee table she had noted earlier while she dragged her princess along 
beside her, using her own body to shield her love from the barrage of 
incoming arrows. The Fire Senshi spared a quick glance to her right as 
she ran, catching a glimpse of the enemy. It appeared her initial belief 
had been correct. The shadows that almost totally engulfed the lobby 
were filled with flashes of movement and the glint of polished metal. 
Mars saw one black-clad assassin dressed in a hooded cloak and loose 
fitting clothes standing slightly hunched against a wall as it pulled 
back horizontally on a short bow, ready to let loose another arrow on 
its deadly course. Lazarus had indeed rallied his associates to expect 
her and her allies. Sailor Mars registered this information in a 
fraction of a second, and then refocused her attention on getting Sailor 
Moon to relative safety. She could hear her comrades&#39; cries behind her, 
but she paid them no heed; her princess&#39;s and true love&#39;s wellbeing came 
first and foremost above all else.

Sailor Mars let out a short grunt as she felt an arrow slice sharply 
along her right shoulder blade, creating a gash in its wake. More 
projectiles whistled by her head as she sprinted for the protection of 
the furniture, the noise of some of the arrows&#39; flights loud in her 
ears, indicating how close they had come to their target. The Senshi of 
Fire almost stumbled and fell as another arrow tore across her leg, just 
above the knee, spraying droplets of red onto the floor. Mars ignored 
it, just like all of the arrows that flew by her. There was no point 
worrying about being struck; that would cause her to hesitate and waste 
time, most likely resulting in her, and Sailor Moon with her, becoming 
pincushions. Instead, Sailor Mars ploughed ahead, not even flinching no 
matter how close she came to being hit as she kept her gaze fixed on her 
and her princess&#39;s salvation, completely disregarding all things that 
could distract her from that goal. Such was the heavy role of a 
bodyguard, a guardian; to fail in one&#39;s duty did not only usually mean 
your own death, but the death of the one you were trying to protect as 
well.

After what had seemed like a hundred metre sprint, but in reality was 
merely a handful of that, Sailor Mars and Sailor Moon finally reached 
the fortification made out of arranged furniture. As soon as Mars was 
near enough, she whipped the arm holding on to her love around, throwing 
a surprised Sailor Moon towards a couch and causing her to bowl over it 
head first and land ungracefully on the other side in a heap. As Sailor 
Mars herself approached the couch, she leapt clean over it, landing in a 
crouch by her rather shocked and disorientated princess. But before the 
Fire Senshi could even catch her breath, she sensed danger directly in 
front of her. She quickly looked up to see a youma assassin, standing on 
the other side of another couch opposite her, level a cocked light 
crossbow straight at her chest, almost about to bury a spiked metal bolt 
into her body. Biting of a curse, Mars moved her hands into the position 
to launch a fireball, but knew the hot blazing attack would come all too 
late for her. All of a sudden a figure dropped down across from Sailor 
Moon, letting out a shout as it did so. The youma assassin barely had 
enough time to gurgle its last breath, let alone fire its crossbow, as a 
razor-sharp stemmed rose took the creature in the throat. Sailor Mars 
looked away from the toppling youma to Tuxedo Kamen, at the same moment 
a panting Sailor Neptune flung herself over the couch-turned-stockade 
and collided with Sailor Moon, sending both senshi sprawling.

&quot;The others?&quot; Sailor Mars asked breathlessly as she quickly scanned her 
eyes over Sailor Moon&#39;s prone body, searching to see if the girl had 
been hurt during their mad dash. The miko&#39;s heart rested easier in her 
chest as she saw that her princess looked like she had escaped from any 
significant injury.

&quot;Don&#39;t know,&quot; Tuxedo Kamen said as he tilted his head to one side, 
avoiding an errant arrow as it skittered along the armrest of the peach 
coloured couch before lodging itself in a cushion of an armchair. &quot; But 
we should be safe here for a time at least; I think this is a partial 
blind spot for their bows.&quot;

&quot;Saturn and the rest are at the other side,&quot; Neptune answered the miko 
as she sat up. Mars noticed a thin wooden shaft of a feathered arrow 
protruding from the Outer Senshi&#39;s bloody right upper arm. The 
aquamarine-haired woman grimaced in pain and grabbed the arrow with one 
hand, then snapped the shaft in two between her fingers, letting out a 
gasp of pain and leaving the now shorter projectile still imbedded in 
her. &quot;I think...&quot; she exhaled deeply.

&quot;Oh no...&quot; Sailor Moon said from where she knelt on the floor. &quot;We have 
to help them!&quot; she declared, and then clambered up the couch to take a 
peek over into the kill zone.

&quot;Usagi! Stay down, it isn&#39;t safe!&quot; Sailor Mars ordered emphatically as 
she pulled on Sailor Moon&#39;s leg, forcing the girl back to safety as the 
storm of arrows continued to rain overhead, the sound of numerous thuds 
on the other side of the couch a testament to how severe the peril had 
become in the lobby.

&quot;Rei--!&quot; Sailor Moon started in surprise, but was swiftly cut off by her 
bodyguard.

&quot;Stay down,&quot; Sailor Mars repeated sternly as Sailor Moon simply stared 
at her. &quot;I&#39;ll check.&quot;

&quot;Careful,&quot; Tuxedo Kamen warned as the Fire Senshi crawled up the couch, 
being diligent to remain as low as possible. Mars pressed her body down 
as flat as she could make it, lest she give the enemy the right angle to 
strike her.

Sailor Mars poked her head above the couch, only revealing enough of 
herself so she could get some idea of her friends&#39; conditions without 
receiving an arrow in the head. She swallowed hard as she took in the 
heated and alarming scene before her. It appeared that the four other 
Sailor Senshi were not as lucky as Mars and the rest of her friends 
behind the furniture barricade. The other Sailor Senshi had apparently 
run to the lobby&#39;s main desk, which was made out of sturdy-looking hard 
wood and with a tiled surface akin to the floor&#39;s. While that should 
have been adequate protection from the bombardment of arrows coming from 
nearly everywhere, unfortunately the youma enemy had evidently decided 
that the main desk was a good defensive obstacle too, and had positioned 
themselves behind it. The resulting clash was messy to say the least.

As Sailor Mars watched anxiously, she saw Sailor Saturn currently 
engaged with three knife-wielding assassins behind the main desk. The 
Senshi of Death moved like a hurricane, skilfully parrying the multiple 
attacks from the trio of youma in swift succession with her Silence 
Glaive, displaying amazing speed and agility, all the while with a cold, 
grim, face. But the young girl&#39;s opponents were skilled themselves, and 
the Fire Senshi could see numerous red rips and tears in her Sailor 
fuku. Saturn kept up her defence however, but with the many blows 
directed her way it was nearly impossible for her to bring about any 
sort of decisive counterattack.

While Sailor Saturn fought, Sailor Mars saw Sailor Jupiter bound up onto 
the slightly curved desk and then race along it as arrows --and also 
crossbow bolts-- fired from youma on the ground floor, flashed by her, 
some taking shreds of fuku with them as they flew past, the bits of 
cloth more often than not stained with blood. However Jupiter did not 
falter under the barrage of such daunting fire. Her features twisted 
into a determined expression as she roared out a wordless cry and soared 
high into the air in a mighty leap across to the first floor balcony. 
Jupiter reached out as far as she could and then grabbed on to the top 
of the balcony&#39;s grey tiled wall with both hands, just barely managing 
to keep her grip as her body swung against the hard stone barrier. The 
archers on the balcony closest to the now climbing Sailor dropped their 
short bows and drew a variety of daggers, most likely to slice the 
fingers from the brunette&#39;s hands and send her falling back down to the 
floor. But before the dark assassins could do such a brutal thing, 
Jupiter had already hoisted herself up and over into the balcony and 
started to tear into the assembled creatures, leading with her fists, 
the close proximity and number of the enemy not allowing any chance for 
her to invoke her powers.

One clever youma hopped onto the balcony&#39;s ledge and ran along it, 
before pouncing at Sailor Jupiter&#39;s exposed back, its dagger&#39;s tip aimed 
downwards. But at the moment the creature would have sunk its weapon 
deep into the tall girl, a bright beam of yellow energy shot from the 
ground floor at the black clad assassin, taking it full in the ribs and 
scorching a large hole clean through the side of its body. The youma was 
catapulted backwards in a horizontal spin by the powerful blast into its 
allies, making more than a few lose their footing and trip over, 
allowing Jupiter to take punishing advantage of their vulnerable 
conditions. Sailor Mars&#39; eyes snapped back to the lobby&#39;s desk and saw 
that Sailor Venus and Sailor Mercury were crowded behind one side, 
getting some shelter from the countless projectiles launched their way, 
while keeping relative safe distance from Sailor Saturn&#39;s fight with the 
three youma. Venus repeatedly fired Crescent Beams at the amassed 
assassins from behind her cover, providing some long-range support for 
Jupiter and slowly but surely thinning down the numbers of archers, 
despite their uncanny dodging. The Senshi of Love looked to have seen 
better days however, and sported numerous wounds that bled profusely... 
worryingly so. The most severe looked to be caused by one arrow that was 
stuck in the blonde&#39;s left shoulder and was haloed with dark red that 
marred her white Sailor fuku. The pain of her injures showed on Venus&#39; 
face as she manifested her Sailor powers from a crouching position, the 
girl gritting her teeth as the constant stretching of the muscles in her 
arm disturbed the arrow jutting obscenely from her shoulder.

Meanwhile, Sailor Mercury was anxiously observing Sailor Saturn&#39;s fight 
with the youma assassin triumvirate, searching for an opening so that 
she could help the taxed Senshi of Death. The blue-haired Inner Senshi 
appeared to have escaped from the most harm in comparison to the three 
other Sailors with only a few scratches, probably caused by being winged 
by arrows, gracing her body.

&quot;So much for a one-on-one fight,&quot; Sailor Mars muttered under her breath. 
It looked like her hunt for Lazarus would be a difficult one if she had 
to wade through this many of his followers. The Fire Senshi dropped back 
down beside Sailor Moon and the others. &quot;It looks bad,&quot; she reported, a 
blatant understatement.

&quot;We can&#39;t just sit here and do nothing!&quot; Sailor Moon exclaimed, looking 
ready to charge out from safety to help her friends no matter what the 
consequences. While Mars admired her courage, there was no way she would 
allow such a foolhardy and ultimately suicidal action.

&quot;We can help them from here, keeping behind relative cover,&quot; Sailor 
Neptune advised.

Tuxedo Kamen nodded and then flicked his wrist, producing three roses 
between the fingers of one clenched fist. &quot;The youma aren&#39;t the only 
ones with long ranged attacks.&quot;

Without warning, the prince&#39;s tall hat was suddenly shot off his head 
and pinned to the couch cushions behind him, the feathered end of an 
arrow protruding from the hat revealing the culprit. Sailor Mars turned 
in the direction the nearly lethal projectile originated from, and saw 
that the enemy had finally moved their position further along the left 
hand side balcony, and also along the ground floor as well. The Fire 
Senshi&#39;s and her three friends&#39; temporary &#39;fortress&#39; had just been 
breached.

&quot;Look out!!&quot; Mars screamed as her position was abruptly saturated with 
incoming arrows and bolts.

A crossbow bolt flashed by Sailor Mars&#146; face, tearing open her cheek and 
making the girl let out a tortured cry of shock mixed with pain. She 
reflexively grabbed her now gushing face with one hand, glaring hate at 
the countless swarms of black shapes milling about the shadows in front 
of her. Resisting the senseless impulse to charge, Sailor Mars strafed 
to her left in a shielding position in front of Sailor Moon, and was 
only mildly surprised when she bumped into a rose-throwing Tuxedo Kamen.

&quot;This is how it&#39;s done!&quot; Sailor Mars sneered at the youma attackers, 
taking her hand away from her scarred and bleeding visage. &quot;MARS FLAME 
SNIPER!&quot;

The Fire Senshi drew her burning bow in a crouch, and then let loose a 
blazing arrow at the enemy on the balcony. The flames of the scorching 
projectile licked at the other in-flight wooden arrows, causing several 
to abruptly burst alight, some even crumbling away to nothing due to the 
sheer intensity of the heat radiating off Mars&#39; blistering attack. The 
group of youma on the balcony ducked hastily behind the safety of the 
tiled wall, making the arrow smash into the ceiling instead. However, 
the resulting explosion of the fiery projectile rained searing flames 
down among the assassins along with numerous chunks of masonry, setting 
some unlucky creatures&#39; clothes ablaze while others were clubbed by 
falling debris.

&quot;DEEP SUBMERGE!&quot;

From behind an armchair she had hastily scrambled behind, Sailor Neptune 
blasted a cluster of tightly packed crossbow-wielding youma with a 
watery sphere, the large ball sucking the life out of many assassins 
before they had a chance to fade back into the shadows.

&quot;Neptune, NO!&quot; Tuxedo Kamen cried as he turned to the Senshi of the 
Ocean.

Mars spared a glance towards Neptune, and realised just exactly 
whereabouts the woman was hiding behind. Before she could yell out her 
own warning, Tuxedo Kamen had already leapt to his feet and tore off his 
cape, throwing it out in the air to his right as he threw a fistful of 
distracting roses at the youma to his left near Saturn and the others, 
creating an improvised smokescreen and providing cover fire 
respectively. The prince desperately dived at a bewildered Neptune at 
the exact moment the assassins on the ground floor at the right hand 
side of the lobby turned their attention to the now exposed Outer 
Senshi. Tuxedo Kamen pushed Sailor Neptune down flat to the floor as a 
shower of crossbow bolts flew over the pair&#39;s heads and pounded into the 
armchair, narrowly missing both by only so much as a hair&#39;s breadth.

&quot;Mamoru!&quot; Sailor Moon wailed, reaching out for her boyfriend with one 
hand as the man&#39;s back came close to being perforated... and also 
leaving the protection of the human shield named Sailor Mars.

Sailor Moon cried out in pain and retracted her arm close to her body 
reflexively as an arrow slashed across her forearm, ripping a line in 
her long glove. Sailor Mars heard her princess&#39;s cry and instantly 
turned her attention towards the girl, ceasing a second fire arrow 
attack in mid breath. Seeing that Sailor Moon had moved away from behind 
her body, without hesitation Sailor Mars swiftly twisted around and 
positioned herself in front of her true love, facing her, as the hail of 
arrows and bolts began to pick up once more, the lack of distracting 
attacks from Tuxedo Kamen and the senshi allowing the youma archers to 
regroup and recover. Sailor Mars gritted her teeth as she felt an arrow 
pierce her upper back on the right side, the miko schooling her face 
into a picture of impassiveness, bar the slight frown of concentration 
that marred her brow as she withheld the urge to scream in agony.

&quot;We... can&#39;t stay here,&quot; Mars said rather haltingly as her back burned 
excruciatingly.

Sailor Moon looked at her guardian situated protectively in front of her 
with some concern while she cradled her hurt arm, as if she could tell 
that the Senshi of Fire was in pain. Perhaps it was due to half of 
Sailor Mars&#39; face being covered in blood. &quot;But what about Mamoru and the 
others?!&quot; the blonde exclaimed, looking back at Tuxedo Kamen and Neptune 
as the two scrambled for any sort of cover as the volley of arrows 
continued.

&quot;Go, Sailor Moon! Go!!&quot; Tuxedo Kamen commanded, waving his hand for 
added emphasis while he and Sailor Neptune desperately dodged the many 
incoming lethal bolts and arrows.

Sailor Mars looked towards the pair of elevators and saw that the floor 
indicators above them showed that both were currently on the ground 
floor. Judging by the floor indicators actually working, she assumed 
that the elevators had power also.

&quot;Come on!&quot; Mars said, quickly standing up with some difficultly and 
pulling her princess to her feet as she did so. She pushed Sailor Moon 
towards the elevators, urging the blonde to run ahead as she followed.

Sailor Moon glanced back to the struggling Tuxedo Kamen for a brief 
instant, and then sped towards the elevators as fast as her legs could 
carry her. Sailor Mars swiftly followed the blonde despite the sharp 
stabs of pain in her back at her movement, weaving a staggered path 
around the countless arrows that stuck out of the tiled floor as she 
launched fireballs from her fingertips, drawing the youma assassins&#39; 
fire towards her instead of Sailor Moon, allowing her princess to 
proceed relatively unhindered. Sailor Mars hunched over in an attempt to 
make herself a smaller target as she ran after Sailor Moon as best she 
could, while arrows whizzed by her head. She looked to her right, in 
time to see a youma fly over the right balcony and land head first with 
a sickening crunch on the hard floor. It seemed Sailor Jupiter was still 
fighting her way through the youma up there.

&quot;Hurry up, Mars!&quot;

Sailor Mars saw that Sailor Moon had reached the security of an 
elevator, and was earnestly waving the Fire Senshi in. Mercifully, it 
did indeed look like the elevator had power, if the light illuminating 
its interior from above was any indication. Mars called upon her 
reserves of energy and increased her pace in a burst of speed, racing 
towards her fretful love. All of a sudden, Sailor Moon&#39;s eyes widened 
and she hurriedly reached up and pulled her tiara off her head. 
Instinctively knowing what had just materialised in the darkness behind 
her, Sailor Mars dived forward and slid along the smooth tiled floor on 
her stomach the rest of the way into the elevator, uprooting a few 
arrows from the ruined surface as she did so.

&quot;MOON TIARA ACTION!&quot;

Sailor Moon&#39;s glowing tiara flashed above the Senshi of Fire and sliced 
into one crossbow-wielding youma, spilling black blood to the already 
messy floor, before it honed in on a second crossbow youma assassin. 
Mars looked over her shoulder in time to see the second creature roll 
out of the way of the spinning tiara, and then fire a bolt in the 
direction of the elevator.

&quot;FIRE SOUL!&quot;

Sailor Mars rolled onto her side and a fireball leapt from her 
fingertips, the globe careering directly at the spry assassin as the 
bolt from its crossbow clanged harmlessly against the metal button panel 
on the wall next to the elevator. The youma darted to the side, avoiding 
the fireball, but at the same time Sailor Moon&#39;s tiara began its return 
path to its owner. The fashion accessory and potent weapon tore through 
the youma from behind, erupting from the black-clad creature&#39;s 
midsection in a horrific spectacle of gore, before returning to Sailor 
Moon&#39;s waiting hand. The squeamish princess looked away in revulsion as 
the youma&#39;s bisected corpse collapsed in a wet mess on the floor.

&quot;Hit the top floor button!&quot; Sailor Mars yelled as she clambered to her 
feet inside the elevator.

&quot;But the others--!&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no choice! If we stay here we&#39;re going to die!&quot; Mars argued 
vehemently, talking over her princess.

Seeing Sailor Moon still hesitate, the Fire Senshi moved towards the 
elevator&#39;s control panel and slammed her fist against the button for the 
twentieth floor. It was just like Mars&#39; kind hearted princess to wait 
for her friends no matter how insanely suicidal it was; it was one of 
the things that the miko loved about the blonde. But it was not Sailor 
Moon&#39;s place to risk her life like that. However, Tuxedo Kamen was out 
in that lobby-turned-war zone too, so perhaps that was the root of 
Sailor Moon&#39;s reluctance to escape.

As the doors to the elevator closed, Sailor Mars caught one last glimpse 
of the prince fleeing from a hail of arrows with Sailor Neptune by his 
side, the man&#39;s tattered cape that he must have retrieved billowing out 
behind him. For Sailor Moon&#39;s sake Sailor Mars prayed that Tuxedo Kamen 
would make it to safety in one piece. She knew that the loss of the 
prince was something that her princess would never recover from. Mars 
did have some experience in losing someone she had loved more than 
anything and anyone in existence, no matter how brief it had been. If it 
was in her power, Sailor Mars would make sure Sailor Moon would never 
have to experience such a terrible thing, even if the Fire Senshi had to 
extend her protection to Tuxedo Kamen.

&quot;We should be safe for now,&quot; Sailor Mars sighed with relief as the 
elevator travelled upwards.

Sailor Moon nodded uncertainly and then replaced her magically clean 
tiara on her head, before leaning back against the elevator wall. Sailor 
Mars swallowed hard and placed a steadying hand on a wall and bowed her 
head as she tried to control the feeling of searing pain radiating from 
her back.

&quot;Rei, you&#39;re hurt!&quot; Sailor Moon exclaimed, finally noticing the wooden 
shaft protruding from the miko&#39;s back. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you say something?!&quot;

&quot;There was... no point in worrying you at the time,&quot; Mars breathed 
heavily through the haze of torment.

There was a jolt as Sailor Moon pressed the button to halt the 
elevator&#39;s ascent, causing Sailor Mars to bite her lip to stifle a cry 
of pain as the arrow in her wobbled at the sudden stop.

&quot;We don&#39;t have time for this...&quot; Mars disputed weakly. &quot;The youma...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re in no condition to fight any youma,&quot; Sailor Moon interjected in 
a firm tone. &quot;Now sit down,&quot; she ordered, pointing to the floor.

Sailor Mars reluctantly complied and sat down with a pain-wracked sigh. 
When her love spoke in that tone there was no use arguing with her. Of 
course, usually that didn&#39;t stop Mars from doing so anyway.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t look too deep...&quot; Sailor Moon mumbled absently. She touched 
the arrow&#39;s shaft delicately, but still managed to disturb Sailor Mars&#39; 
wound, eliciting a sharp intake of breath from the injured senshi. 
&quot;Sorry,&quot; the blonde quickly apologised.

&quot;If it isn&#39;t deep, then you should pull it out,&quot; Sailor Mars said, 
speaking as if it were the most natural thing in the world. After a 
hearing a lack of response from Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars looked over her 
shoulder to see a pale-looking blonde girl staring apprehensively back 
at her.

&quot;A-Are you sure?&quot; Sailor Moon stammered uncertainly. &quot;It&#39;ll... hurt...&quot;

&quot;I guess,&quot; Mars said casually, though inside she was mentally preparing 
herself for the eventual agony. The arrow head was barbed she knew, but 
she didn&#39;t have to tell her love that. &quot;Come on, Usagi, we don&#39;t have 
time,&quot; she went on, seeing her princess&#39;s indecision.

Sailor Moon swallowed hard and then nodded stiffly. &quot;Okay...&quot;

Sailor Moon gingerly clutched the arrow shaft with both hands, and then 
looked to Sailor Mars for some kind of signal. &quot;Make sure you pull as 
hard as you can,&quot; the Fire Senshi said, looking away from Sailor Moon 
and down to the floor. &quot;And don&#39;t stop until it&#39;s out.&quot; She paused for a 
few seconds, and then her body became tense. &quot;Do it now,&quot; she requested.

Sailor Mars began to sweat profusely and clenched her teeth in sheer 
torturous suffering as Sailor Moon yanked hard on the arrow imbedded in 
her back, the girl pulling at it with all her might. It burned like 
fury, and Mars couldn&#39;t help the strangled scream that escaped from her 
throat. Sailor Moon continued to follow her bodyguard&#39;s earlier 
instructions despite the raven-haired girl&#39;s cries however, and kept 
tugging on the arrow until the barbed head forcibly shredded through the 
Fire Senshi&#39;s flesh before finally coming loose.

Sailor Mars let out a shuddering sigh of pure relief as she felt the 
arrow leave her body. Sailor Moon sobbed and pressed one hand firmly 
against the now spurting wound as she wrapped her other arm around her 
bodyguard, hugging her tightly.

&quot;Rei... Rei...&quot; the blonde sniffled. &quot;You&#39;re always getting hurt; why 
can&#39;t you be more careful?&quot;

Sailor Mars said nothing, the raven-haired girl merely letting her mind 
swim in the afterglow of intense pain. There was no answer she could 
give that wouldn&#39;t just make her caring princess more upset.

&quot;Please, Rei... I don&#39;t like having your blood on my hands,&quot; Sailor Moon 
went on, pressing her cheek close to Sailor Mars&#39; unbloodied one. The 
Fire Senshi wondered if her princess&#39;s words were intentionally meant to 
have a double meaning.

The two girls remained that way for a time, both silent while Sailor 
Moon kept pressure on Sailor Mars&#39; arrow wound, waiting until the 
bleeding stopped. Mars could hear muted sounds from above and below the 
elevator, no doubt the noises of battle between her and her love&#39;s 
comrades and the youma enemy. She wondered who was faring better.

&quot;Do you think everyone else is okay?&quot; Sailor Moon whispered into Sailor 
Mars&#39; ear.

&quot;They can handle themselves,&quot; Sailor Mars said with confidence she 
didn&#39;t truly feel. She knew that anyone who had stayed in the building&#39;s 
lobby was certain to eventually succumb to the relentless bombardment 
from the youma assassins. She hoped her friends had made it out of there 
all right.

******

Sailor Mercury let out a wheezing breath as she plodded up the eighth 
flight of stairs so far behind Sailor Jupiter with feet that felt like 
they were filled with heavy lead. It seemed liked she had been climbing 
up stairs for absolutely ages, caught in a never ending loop of hard 
white steps and identical bare white-washed walls. The repetitiveness of 
simply hiking up bland stairs was starting to take its toll on the 
blue-haired genius&#39; mind, let alone her body. Her thoughts were 
beginning to wander aimlessly, and during a combat situation that she 
and her friends were currently still in, that could be extremely 
perilous.

Mercury paused for a moment to wipe the perspiration that covered her 
forehead and then took another heaving breath, before continuing her 
painstaking journey. She and Jupiter had deemed it was most likely that 
the other Sailor Senshi and Tuxedo Kamen would try to reach the highest 
floor of the office building, so the two girls had decided to do 
likewise. Mercury believed that taking an elevator to the top floor 
would be far too precarious; all the youma enemy would have to do is 
either cut the power, leaving the senshi to the assassins&#39; mercy, or 
worse cut the cable holding the elevator and send the girls plummeting 
to an untimely end. Therefore, Sailor Mercury had suggested that she and 
Sailor Jupiter should take the stairs instead. Nineteen floors up didn&#39;t 
sound like such a taxing ordeal at the time while hordes of youma were 
gnashing at her heels. How wrong Mercury had been. She wondered if she 
would pass out due to the strenuous slog, or perhaps even go into 
cardiac arrest. The fact that the Senshi of Water wasn&#39;t ruling such 
possibilities out was a testament to the hardship she was suffering.

Sailor Mercury hoped the others were well. The state of affairs in the 
lobby had been treacherous to say the least, and a hasty exit had been 
obviously called for. So when she had heard and saw Jupiter&#39;s frantic 
plea for her to take her hand from a first floor balcony, Mercury had 
readily complied. She hadn&#39;t liked abandoning her friends, but Sailor 
Moon and Sailor Mars had already evacuated the area, and Sailor Neptune 
and Tuxedo Kamen had been tactically withdrawing also, so the 
blue-haired genius had decided to do the same with her girlfriend. 
Sailor Mercury worried about Sailor Venus and Sailor Saturn however. The 
last she had seen of the pair was during the time when she was being 
hauled out of danger up to the balcony by Sailor Jupiter&#39;s strong arms. 
Sailor Saturn had struck down her last remaining youma opponent, the 
other two both having had been turned into ice sculptures by Sailor 
Mercury, and had then been preparing to vault over the lobby&#39;s main desk 
using her Glaive into a charging pack of assassins. Meanwhile Venus had 
been furiously shooting Crescent Beam after Crescent Beam into a mob of 
youma archers as she slowly retreated towards a staircase, all the while 
screaming at Saturn to abandon the battle and fall back with her. By 
that time Sailor Mercury had already been pulled to safety, and had been 
turning around to flee with Sailor Jupiter as black mists began to form 
in the shadows around the balcony. She prayed Sailor Saturn and Sailor 
Venus had managed to beat back the enemy and escape also.

Sailor Mercury once again wiped the sweat from her brow and breathed 
arduously as she looked up at Sailor Jupiter marching up the stairs 
ahead of her, the brunette&#39;s ponytail bobbing with each sure step. She 
speculated how her girlfriend could endure it. Jupiter was quite tall, 
Mercury mused, a fair amount taller than her, and thus had longer legs, 
allowing for a bigger stride. Mercury analytically watched the firm 
muscles in Jupiter&#39;s long legs flex as she proceeded up the stairs, and 
found her eyes gradually roam higher unconsciously. The blue-haired girl 
blinked a few times and then swallowed, more sweat starting to form on 
her brow that was not due from the laborious ascent. From this angle, 
Mercury noted she could see straight up her girlfriend&#39;s short skirt.

&quot;This is taking forever,&quot; Sailor Jupiter sighed in frustration and 
stopped walking, making her girlfriend automatically do likewise. She 
looked over her shoulder at Sailor Mercury, and then raised a quizzical 
eyebrow at the girl&#39;s flushed cheeks. &quot;Are you okay? You look hot.&quot;

Sailor Mercury&#39;s eyes widened at the brunette&#39;s choice of words and then 
she quickly averted her gaze, her face reddening an even deeper shade. 
&quot;I-I&#39;m fine,&quot; she stammered, mentally chastising herself for her lack of 
discipline. They were in stairwell with youma assassins searching 
fervently for them, all hell bent on killing them too she might add, 
while their friends were missing and all Mercury could think about 
was... was... Mercury shook her head to clear it. This was simply 
unacceptable.

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Sailor Jupiter persisted, turning around to face Sailor 
Mercury fully and placing a hand on her hip. &quot;We can take a short break, 
if you need it.&quot;

Sailor Mercury nodded rigidly. &quot;No, it&#39;s okay,&quot; she said, doing her best 
to not speak to the brunette&#39;s very ample chest. She shut her eyes and 
took a second to control her inappropriate thoughts. Luna had always 
argued against Mercury and Jupiter being together on the grounds of 
their judgement being clouded during a battle, and the Senshi of Water 
certainly did not want to ever prove the feline right. The two Sailors 
had an important task at hand, and Mercury could not let herself become 
distracted.

&quot;Alright,&quot; Jupiter said, and then turned around and resumed climbing the 
stairs. After a moment, the brunette stopped again. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll 
take care of you after this is all over...&quot; she said in a voice as 
smooth as velvet, winking impishly over her shoulder at Mercury.

Sailor Mercury felt her face blush hotly once more and she looked down 
to the steps in front of her. She should have known she couldn&#39;t hide 
anything from her lover. Mercury certainly was glad they were alone, or 
she probably would have fainted from mortification under the relentless 
teasing from her friends.

Sailor Jupiter let out a light laugh, but it cut off sharply. The tall 
senshi paused in mid step and cocked her head to one side, appearing to 
listen for something. &quot;I thought I...&quot; Jupiter mumbled uncertainly.

Sailor Mercury&#39;s head snapped sharply to the upper right as several 
shiny objects suddenly spun through the air directly at Sailor Jupiter. 
Before she could shout a warning however, Jupiter had already dived 
forward and was curling into a roll on the landing at the top of the 
stairs, ending up in a crouch as the objects imbedded themselves in the 
steps the brunette had previously been standing on. Mercury blinked at 
the star shaped objects stuck in the linoleum surface of the stairs, 
recognising shurikens when she saw them.

But before Sailor Mercury had a chance to ponder more on her 
observation, a black-clad assassin swung down from the landing on the 
floor above, kicking out at Sailor Jupiter&#39;s face with two black, 
tightly wrapped feet. Sailor Jupiter was faster however, and willingly 
fell backwards, landing on her back and evading the attack.

&quot;SUPREME THUNDER!&quot;

Sailor Jupiter quickly blasted the youma with a near point blank 
electrical attack, hitting the creature dead centre, causing it to jerk 
and spasm painfully as the current made all its muscles contract 
involuntarily. Sailor Mercury pulled her attention away from her lover 
as she heard soft padding footsteps behind her. She swiftly swivelled 
around to see that two youma armed in each hand with a rattan stick of 
some sort, just a little longer than a metre in length, were stealthily 
approaching her from the landing at the bottom of the stairs she was 
standing on. The pair of assassins twirled their weaponry around in 
their grasps gracefully, and Mercury realised that the short poles where 
actually escrima sticks, strong and formidable weapons in trained hands. 
The blue-haired genius also realised that she would be no match for the 
creatures if she allowed them to engage her in close combat. While she 
had learned some basic karate moves from Jupiter, she was certain she 
would be a total pushover for the clearly skilful youma duo.

&quot;SHINING AQUA ILLUSION!&quot;

A geyser was sent bursting forth from Mercury&#39;s hands, directly at the 
two assassins. As the pillar of water roared towards the pair, one youma 
darted to the left, out of the attack&#39;s path, while the other pressed 
itself flush against the wall on the right. The second youma was not 
quite fast enough however, and one of its escrima sticks was torn from 
its grip and frozen solid instantly, before shattered against the wall 
due to the force of Mercury&#39;s blast, the hard and cured rattan made 
brittle by its icy casing.

The first black-clad youma quickly regathered its wits and jumped onto 
the stairway&#39;s handrail, and then nimbly ran up it. The creature then 
leapt off the rail as it raised both its escrima sticks above its head, 
preparing to cave in Sailor Mercury&#39;s skull. Mercury desperately ducked 
and scampered further down the stairs, just barely avoiding the youma&#39;s 
overhead swing as the rattan sticks cracked loudly on the steps behind 
her.

By that time the second youma assassin had recovered, but before it 
could bring its remaining escrima stick to bear, Mercury took the 
initiative and lashed out with one foot, smashing it into the enemy&#39;s 
face and making it stagger backwards. The blue-haired girl winced in 
pain as her foot felt like it had kicked a brick wall. But she didn&#39;t 
have time to recuperate however, as the other youma took advantage of 
the senshi&#39;s vulnerable back and whacked both rattan sticks sharply 
across it. Sailor Mercury cried out in agony at the impact of the dual 
heavy blows and then stumbled forwards, tripping over the steps of the 
stairway before tumbling down them, ending up crashing painfully in a 
bruised and battered heap at the bottom landing.

Sailor Mercury groaned and began opening her eyes lethargically, but as 
she saw the rapidly incoming black covered foot speeding directly at her 
face, the girl&#39;s eyes snapped fully open, utterly awake. She hurriedly 
rolled to the side, somehow evading the kick, and then scrambled to her 
feet. The Sailor Senshi hopped backwards and swiftly called upon her 
water-based powers.

&quot;SHINING AQUA ILLUSION!&quot;

The youma that had been hit by the same attack before this time had no 
chance to dodge it. That didn&#39;t stop the assassin from attempting 
however, and in an amazing feat of agility, the youma bounded high into 
the air, trying to simply jump over the blue geyser. Mercury&#39;s adversary 
didn&#39;t gain enough height however, and the watery attack rammed into its 
legs, freezing its entire lower body solid. The youma crashed down to 
the floor, splintering its legs-turned-ice into a hundred wet angular 
shards. The darkly dressed assassin verbally expressed its torment in a 
piercing, inhuman, screech, until its companion viciously smashed an 
escrima stick against its throat, crushing its larynx and ceasing its 
scream abruptly, granting it a slow death by suffocation.

The unmerciful youma ignored its mewing comrade and turned sharply to 
Sailor Mercury, its rather reptilian-looking eyes showing from beneath 
its hood glaring coldly at the girl. Mercury quickly repositioned her 
hands to attack again, but the youma stuck out brutally with both its 
rattan sticks, forcibly banging the senshi&#39;s arms down and no doubt 
leaving a big bruise on each of her forearms. Sailor Mercury whimpered 
in pain and staggered back against a wall, rubbing her throbbing arms 
with her hands. The girl desperately manoeuvred her head out of the way 
as the youma thrust at her skull with the end of one stick, wishing to 
mash her brains to pulp. The creature followed up with its other escrima 
stick, pounding the hard rattan cruelly against the Sailor&#39;s ribs. 
Mercury clutched her burning ribs and fell to the floor on her side, 
finding it difficult to breath, the torture of the hit as great as it 
was. She wasn&#39;t certain, but she thought that perhaps some of her ribs 
had been cracked or broken. She prayed that was not the case.

Sailor Mercury looked up at her assailant with blurry tearful eyes, her 
body wracked with pain. She knew she had to move, but she just couldn&#39;t 
bring her pummelled form to obey her frantic commands. The youma lifted 
one stick above its head, ready to deliver the killing blow to the 
senshi&#39;s head.

Suddenly a white-gloved hand grabbed the assassin&#39;s wrist in an iron 
grip, causing the creature to look over its shoulder at the figure 
responsible. &quot;Hey! That&#39;s my girl!&quot; Sailor Jupiter snarled through 
clenched teeth, glaring fiercely into the youma&#39;s reptilian eyes.

Jupiter pulled on Mercury&#39;s attacker&#146;s arm with all her strength while 
she grabbed the assassin&#39;s shoulder with her free hand, wrenching the 
creature&#39;s limb completely out of its socket with a stomach-turning 
crick sound. The youma hissed in agony and attempted to club Jupiter 
with an escrima stick, desperate to beat the enraged girl off of him. 
The tall brunette let go of her enemy&#39;s shoulder and brought her arm up, 
blocking the attack, the hard rattan impacting loudly on the girl&#39;s 
harder bone and muscles.

Sailor Jupiter grabbed the youma with both hands and then hefted it 
across the landing, throwing it viciously against the wall and making it 
howl in torment as its dislocated arm flopped about obscenely.

&quot;SPARKLING WIDE PRESSURE!&quot;

Jupiter threw a bright ball of pure energy at the youma, blasting its 
torso to ragged pieces as her attack detonated, sending its arms and 
head careering off in spirals of black blood and crackling electrical 
discharge, before they landed in sodden ebony heaps on the landing and 
stairs.

Sailor Jupiter knelt down to Sailor Mercury and touched her shoulder 
gingerly. &quot;Are you okay? Can you stand?&quot; she asked tenderly.

Seeing the uncertainty in her lover&#39;s blue eyes, Jupiter gently slipped 
her arm around Mercury and carefully helped the battered girl to her 
feet. Sailor Mercury smiled tremulously at her strong yet compassionate 
love, silently thanking her for her support.

&quot;The other youma...?&quot; Mercury inquired, moving her gaze to the landing 
at the top of the stairs as she leaned against the brunette.

&quot;There were two,&quot; Jupiter revealed, letting the blue-haired genius rest 
her weight against her body. &quot;Neither will be getting up again.&quot;

&quot;So... my disciples are dead,&quot; an unfeeling voice interrupted from the 
top of the stairway to the right of Mercury and Jupiter. &quot;Clearly they 
were not worthy.&quot;

Both Sailor Mercury and Sailor Jupiter tensed as a youma dressed similar 
to the others slowly walked down the stairs, taking precise, deliberate 
steps. It appeared male, but his black garb bulged in unusual places 
with pointed protrusions, as if there were strange bone structures 
hidden beneath his clothes. The youma wore no hooded cloak, or a cloak 
at all for that matter, and only a tight black scarf covered the lower 
part of his face, thus revealing a pale white baldhead adorned with a 
red headband and two small pointed horns that sprouted from his cranium. 
But the main distinguishing feature of the youma was his eyes. They were 
round, and they glowed an unnatural deep azure, so much so that the 
actual true colour of his eyes were hidden. Though perhaps dark blue 
were their true colour. The assassin&#39;s eyes burned with blue fire, and 
he moved fluidly and purposefully, the combination symbolic of a being 
who knew himself perfectly, and had channelled that knowledge to give 
him supernatural strength of body and soul.

The bald horned youma stopped on the fourth step from the bottom and 
reached behind his back, moving in a blur, and drew two short 
wide-bladed swords with slightly curved tips and ornate hand guards. 
Butterfly swords, Mercury knew, remembering seeing pictures of them in 
one of the many, many, books she had read.

&quot;Perhaps you shall find *me* a more challenging foe...&quot; he said, 
pointing at the two girls with one sword.

&quot;You better sit this one out, Ami,&quot; Sailor Jupiter advised, gently but 
insistently pushing Sailor Mercury behind her as far away from the youma 
as possible, while keeping her gaze vigilantly affixed on the new enemy. 
&quot;Leave him to me.&quot;

Sailor Mercury stepped back and scuttled down another set of stairs out 
of the way, wanting to give Sailor Jupiter as much room to move as 
possible. While the Senshi of Water wanted to assist her girlfriend 
greatly, she knew that it would be difficult for her to be able to get a 
clear shot at the youma while the tall girl was battling it. For now, 
Mercury had to be content to merely watch... no matter how 
nerve-wracking it would be.

Without warning the bald assassin dived off the last four steps straight 
at Sailor Jupiter, his twin butterfly swords leading the way. Jupiter 
darted to the side just as the creature passed, and then prepared to 
deliver a chop to his back as a counter. However the youma moved like 
lightning, and using only his knees, leapt into the air from a kneeling 
position on the ground into a backwards somersault, preforming a 
physics-defying manoeuvre. The aerial move surprised Jupiter, causing 
her counterattack to over swing and for her to stumble forwards 
slightly, breaking her stance. The youma took advantage of the lull in 
his opponent&#39;s concentration, and lunged at Jupiter&#39;s stomach with his 
right sword as soon as his feet touched the floor. Sailor Jupiter barely 
managed to angle her body away from the disembowelling attack, letting 
the blade flash by her body. She quickly lashed out with her left fist 
at the exact same time the youma stabbed at her with his left butterfly 
sword, bending his head to one side as he did so, easily evading the 
tall girl&#39;s strike. Jupiter desperately grabbed the assassin&#39;s wrist, 
forestalling the impending impalement of her midsection, and then 
twisted her body around until her back was to the creature, still 
holding on to its wrist and adding her other hand to her grip, before 
pulling her opponent over her shoulder, initiating a throw.

Just as the youma&#39;s back was about to slam with bone-crunching force 
against the hard floor, he bent his knees and let his feet take the 
impact instead, somehow absorbing the power of Jupiter&#39;s shoulder throw 
with his legs. The bald youma&#39;s free blade flashed in front of Sailor 
Jupiter&#39;s face, forcing the girl to release him. Jupiter jumped 
backwards near a wall of the stairway landing, giving herself more room.

&quot;Try this!&quot; she yelled out. &quot;JUPITER OAK EVOLUTION!&quot;

A barrage of razor-sharp leaves were fired at the now upright youma, 
taking the creature aback. He dodged as best he could, using his swords 
to deflect the numerous attacks in a display of sparks, but it was 
simply impossible to avoid all of the cutting projectiles, and soon the 
youma&#39;s clothing was ripped in a myriad of places, black blood oozing 
through the tears. The slightly slumped assassin took a few laboured 
breaths, his chest heaving visibly, and then straightened fully. He was 
still standing. Mercury swallowed worriedly and then returned to avidly 
observing the fight, searching for any sort of opening that she could 
use to somehow help her lover.

The youma glowered grimly at an equally serious Jupiter, and then sprung 
forward, slicing at the brunette&#39;s features with both of his wide-bladed 
swords in a dual horizontal slash. Sailor Jupiter threw her head back 
hurriedly as the sharp weapons sped by her face, and then gasped in pain 
and hunched over, the youma following up his first attack with a knee 
hammering into her stomach. The assassin then fluidly brought his fist 
up in a left hook to smash against Jupiter&#39;s jaw, the steel hand guard 
on his butterfly sword bashing the senshi&#39;s head roughly to one side. 
Sailor Jupiter pushed out with both hands at her assailant in a reckless 
move, desperate to give herself some space and relieve the pressure she 
was currently under. The youma was knocked back only marginally, but it 
was enough for a capable Sailor Jupiter to take advantage of. The tall 
Inner Senshi darted around the youma, just as the creature himself began 
to turn around, hacking at the fleeing girl and slitting open a large 
cut on her arm with one sword. Sailor Jupiter quickly kicked out blindly 
behind her, her rash yet powerful attack catching the youma by surprise 
and making him stumble backwards due to the sheer force of the blow. The 
senshi spun on her heel and delivered a punishing roundhouse kick to her 
enemy&#39;s head, but not before the spry assassin had stooped low and 
ripped upwards with both butterfly swords in vicious, crippling 
manoeuvre. Sailor Jupiter screamed as the two blades tore into the flesh 
of her leg, gouging deep furrows that poured red blood to the floor, 
mixing with the black internal fluids of the felled youma corpses about 
her. Jupiter staggered back, visibly limping, as her adversary, his 
expression still retaining its dour appearance despite his decisive 
strike, flitted forwards, preparing to finish off his foe. The youma&#39;s 
eyes seemed to burn a deeper blue as he pulled back one arm to stab at 
the vulnerable Sailor Jupiter, ready to skewer the brunette senshi with 
one butterfly sword and pin her run-through carcass to the wall behind 
her.

&quot;SHINING AQUA ILLUSION!&quot;

Suddenly out of nowhere a huge pillar of rushing water smashed into the 
bald horned assassin&#39;s exposed back, covering it and half the creature&#39;s 
face before it could dive to safety. Sailor Mercury had barely managed 
to stifle her cry when her lover had been brutally hit, wishing to 
remain as quiet as possible so that the youma would hopefully forget 
about her presence. And so that then she could make her *own* decisive 
strike.

The youma staggered rigidly about on partially ice-encased legs, his 
breathing awkward as he struggled to force air past his half frozen 
lips. The entire left side of the ill-fated assassin&#39;s head was a solid 
ice block, the thin chilly vapours rising in lazy wisps off the blue 
tinted mass indicating its very low temperature.

Sailor Jupiter mouth curled into a sinister smile. &quot;She&#39;s got my back,&quot; 
she declared to the youma&#39;s face stuck in a stunned rictus. &quot;Who has 
yours?&quot;

And with that, Jupiter&#39;s right fist lashed out at the assassin&#39;s head, 
shattering half its skull into splintered ruins, the shining pieces of 
glass-like ice spraying out widely backwards to collide against the 
wall. The youma toppled stiffly over, the rest of his partially frozen 
corpse smashing to bits as it hit the floor. Sailor Mercury and Sailor 
Jupiter breathed a collective sigh of immense relief.

&quot;I was so worried!&quot; Mercury said, rushing to her girlfriend&#39;s side to 
give the brunette some support and a quick hug. &quot;Your leg... are you 
able to walk?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I think so,&quot; Jupiter answered as she glanced down at her fallen 
opponent. &quot;His technical skill and efficiency was brilliant,&quot; she 
commented, letting out a weary sigh. &quot;But there was one thing he didn&#39;t 
have...&quot; The tall Sailor turned her head to Mercury and grinned at her. 
&quot;A beautiful, smart, loving girl by his side.&quot;

&quot;Let that be a lesson to all martial artists,&quot; Sailor Mercury remarked 
wryly to her love, but with an impish smile.

&quot;How is your side?&quot; Sailor Jupiter inquired with concern lacing her 
tone, making a small gesture towards the offending area with her head.

Mercury blinked as she realised she had forgotten all about her own sore 
body while her attention had been glued to Jupiter&#39;s fight. She brought 
a tentative hand to her ribs. They still ached, but not as much. It 
looked like she had escaped a fracture after all.

&quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; the blue-haired girl said. &quot;I&#39;m fine. But you should rest 
awhile and recover. Your leg needs to be tended.&quot;

Jupiter nodded in agreement, but with plain reluctance. &quot;Okay. But not 
for too long, it&#39;s not safe to stay here, and the others might need our 
help.&quot;

&quot;I doubt you will be much help in this state,&quot; Mercury said gently, 
helping the tall brunette lower herself into a sitting position against 
a wall. &quot;Let Dr. Mizuno take care of you first, and then we&#39;ll see,&quot; she 
added in a somewhat playful voice, hoping to put Jupiter&#39;s heart at 
ease. She knew that no matter how badly her girlfriend had been hurt, 
she would still insist on going to help the other Sailor Senshi and 
Tuxedo Kamen. Jupiter&#39;s indomitable strength of will was something 
Mercury admired and loved about her girlfriend. She knew that she could 
probably never match Jupiter&#146;s strength, but she hoped that one day her 
own spirit could come close to the brunette&#146;s inner strength.

Sailor Mercury reached behind her and undid the bow decorating the rear 
of her fuku, and then pulled the long strip of light blue material 
completely off. She looked at the cloth in her hands critically. Yes, 
she decided, it would be adequate to stem the blood flow from Jupiter&#39;s 
slashed leg until better medical treatment could be provided. The 
blue-haired genius spared an analytical look at Jupiter&#39;s other numerous 
injuries, but deemed them light enough to not need care at the current 
time.

&quot;I wonder where the others are...&quot; Sailor Jupiter murmured absently, 
verbally expressing her thoughts while Sailor Mercury bandaged her leg 
tightly.

&quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;re perfectly all right,&quot; Mercury assured her girlfriend 
as she finished tying off the improvised bandage. &quot;In all likelihood 
they will all still be trying to reach the highest level of this 
building, if they haven&#39;t already done so,&quot; she went on. &quot;We should 
continue to do the same.&quot; The thought of resuming the hard slog up just 
under a dozen flights of stairs was not appealing to Mercury, but what 
other choice did they have? She looked at Sailor Jupiter&#39;s wounded leg, 
worry starting to show in her blue eyes. &quot;Perhaps we should risk taking 
an elevator...&quot; she suggested carefully after a slight pause.

&quot;Thank god,&quot; Sailor Jupiter said with great relief, letting out a deep 
breath. &quot;If I had to climb any more steps I would have lost all feeling 
in my legs.&quot;

Sailor Mercury smiled at her lover, and then helped her stand, before 
the two struggled for the nearest exit to search for an easier way to 
travel to the twentieth floor.
