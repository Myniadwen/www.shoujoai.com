<h1>Minako's Warrior (part 4 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jwelch.html">Jessica Welch</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/minwar-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Note: I got a little carried away with the youma battle. But I don&#39;t
think it takes away from the story. It&#39;s not a conventional battle
so... ARTISTIC LICENSE BABY! =D Also the attacks used have no bearing
on the timeline since there isn&#39;t one. It&#39;s my story so they get to use
whatever they want to blow stuff up.

The song &quot;I Am Body Beautiful&quot; is from the soundtrack &quot;To Wong Foo,
Thanks for Everything ... Julie Newman&quot; and is preformed by Salt-N-Pepa

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The five girls were going in and out of various shops, weaving through
people trying to avoid the large crowds. Rei, Usagi, and Minako were
leading the group and Ami and Makoto doddled behind. Makoto was there
to get new clothes but she wasn&#39;t hunting for a sale like Mina and
Usagi were. Rei was just there to pester the bunny and see if there
were any new manga out. And Ami tagged along to people watch,
especially two certain original senshi.

&quot;So what&#39;s going on with Rei-chan?&quot; Makoto asked after the other three
ducked into a store.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Ami replied pretending she didn&#39;t know what the
taller girl was talking about.

&quot;Come off it Ami-chan. We all know you have something on Rei and I want
to know what it is. It must be something really big for you to get her
to clam up so quickly.&quot;

&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; with that the blue hair genius ducked into the store
leaving Makoto to stand alone outside.

Rei was busy telling Usagi that she would never look as good as her.
Minako was modeling a red shirt vying for attention. Finding she
wouldn&#39;t get any where she was she went out and grabbed Makoto&#39;s arm
and dragged her in with the rest of them.

&quot;Do you have any idea what Ami-chan has on Rei?&quot;

&quot;I might have an idea but I don&#39;t want to say anything. It&#39;s Rei&#39;s
business and if she wants us to know she&#39;ll tell us. You know how
delicate matters of the heart are.&quot; Minako brushed some of Makoto&#39;s
bangs away from her eyes and smiled.

&quot;Maybe she just needs a bit of friendly persuasion,&quot; she replied
socking her fist into her palm and grinned evilly.

Minako gave her a serious look and shook her head. &quot;I think we should
just leave her be. When she&#39;s ready to tell us she will. Now come on.
We have clothes to buy. I need to make sure what ever you get looks
good on me too.&quot; She winked impishly and continued to drag her to the
back of the store where the rest of the girls were.

Makoto dug in her heels and refused to be moved. &quot;Not until you tell me
what you think is up with her. At least you have some kind of hint that
apparently I missed.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that hard to miss if you know what you&#39;re looking for. Plus
I&#39;m not 100% sure it&#39;s what I think it is. But I can say I feel the
charge in the air when I&#39;m around her. And I think that&#39;s just because
I can pick up on those kinda vibes being sailor Venus and all.&quot;

It only took a few moments to pick up on Minako&#39;s well placed hints. It
was hard to believe at times how subtle the blonde could be when she
wanted to. That was one of the things Makoto loved about her angel. She
had a lot of maturity underneath her crazed and carefree personality.
Sometimes Makoto wondered just how much of her childhood was lost while
she was in England being Sailor V. It would explain her childish
behavior now. Makoto was glad when she was being dragged away again by
Minako. It dragged her away from those more depressing thoughts.

Makoto picked up a pair of jeans and a sweat shirt from the store
before they moved to the next. Minako had insisted on trying on the
sweatshirt to make sure it looked good on her too. She also tried it on
over another shirt... and tried it on with a pair of caprice... and
tied around her waist with a different shirt before Makoto actually
bought the items.

The same general thing happened in the next stores too. Makoto kept one
eye trained on Rei while she picked out clothes. So far nothing was
unusual. The constant bickering with Usagi and the large ego were all
the same. She thought it might have something to do with Ami, but then
again that didn&#39;t make much sense considering Ami was the one who kept
her in check with the blackmail. She wondered if maybe it was herself
that was the point of interest. But that just didn&#39;t fit either. She
wasn&#39;t really that close to Rei. That only left one other person. Her
fist unconsciously clenched when she thought of Rei making goo goo eyes
at her Mina.

Her eyes narrowed considerably when Rei and Mina were looking at a red
blazer. Rei was standing just a bit to close to the blonde for her
taste. She clenched her teeth as Mina brushed some of Rei&#39;s silky black
hair away and held the blazer closer to her face. She was on the verge
of charging over there and using that friendly persuasion in a way that
wasn&#39;t entirely friendly.

&quot;They are just shopping Mako-chan. Contain your jealousy and maybe I&#39;ll
tell you who Rei has her attention on. But it&#39;s not your blonde
girlfriend&quot; Ami had somehow appeared beside her. She had that creepy
way of being somewhere when she should be. Makoto took a deep breath
and willed herself to calm down. She would ask later how Ami knew what
was going through her head.

&quot;So who is it then,&quot; she was getting frustrated.

Ami shrugged. It was hard playing this game. She couldn&#39;t tell Makoto
because she promised to keep Rei&#39;s secret. But she could just stand by
and let Makoto think something wrong and risk injury to Rei. &quot;Think
about what I just said.&quot; Ami again slipped away before more questions
could be posed.

&quot;I think she enjoys being that creepy.&quot; Makoto mumbled to herself.
&quot;like she&#39;s part ninja, popping up without warning, slipping away
before you can make her talk.&quot;

&quot;You know if you&#39;re going to talk to yourself at least have some sort
of animal around. I mean, I have Luna and she can talk back and all,
but my mom doesn&#39;t know that and she doesn&#39;t find it too odd. But
people are staring Mako-chan. So what&#39;s up?&quot;

Makoto shook her head and smiled. &quot;Nothing important. Let&#39;s go see what
Koko and Rei are buying.&quot; She winked as Usagi started laughing at her
pet name again.

They joined the others and Makoto puzzled over Ami&#39;s words. There was
no point in asking Usagi. She was oblivious to such things. She didn&#39;t
even know Artemis had a thing for Luna. Makoto was ready to call it a
day. They had been there for 3 hours now and she had all the clothes
she needed. Usagi had bought an outfit for the upcoming date and Mina
had grabbed a few accessories to add to her wardrobe.

Suddenly there were people screaming and the pool of bodies in front of
them began to split and separate as something moved through it.
Outraged yelling followed. The girls craned their necks trying to get a
better look at what was happening. Makoto could see easily over
everyone&#39;s head but she still couldn&#39;t tell what was going on. All she
knew was something was headed their way and fast. Before she could give
warning it was there. The blur grabbed Minako&#39;s bag and ripped it from
her grasp as it went by.

&quot;HEY! COME BACK HERE!&quot; Mina was holding her wrist enraged. Ami had her
computer out and was scanning the area. Whatever it was wasn&#39;t human.
Not moving that fast. Minako was storming after it pushing up her
sleeves. Makoto grabbed her around the waist and picked her up. &quot;IT
STOLE MY THINGS! I WANT THEM BACK! PUT ME DOWN MAKO-CHAN!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s definitely a youma Mina-chan. I believe you should transform
first before going after it. In fact I think we should all transform
given its speed.&quot; Ami punched a few more buttons while saying this.
&quot;It&#39;s headed for the food court. We should be able to cut it off
there.&quot;

Mina had her fists clenched and her arms were stiff. She was still
dangling off the ground. Her chin jutted out and she spoke barely below
the level of a yell. &quot;When we find it, I want it at it first.&quot; Makoto
gently set her down and the blonde stomped off to an empty hall to
transform.

Rei and Usagi watched her go and then turned to Makoto for an
explanation. She shrugged. &quot;You just don&#39;t want to mess with her new
stuff before she&#39;s had a chance to wear it.&quot; She followed the irate
senshi and transformed herself. The rest of them filed that information
away and before continuing.

They had reached the food court before the youma had and spread out.
Ami decided they had to corner it if they were going to have a chance.
Usagi was busily drooling over the food and sneaking a few pretzels
when no one was looking. They had cleared all the people out of the
area before hand. Rei had caught her with a chicken tender in her mouth
but before she could yell at her the daemon showed up. The mere site of
it made her speechless along with the rest of the senshi.

It had stopped when it reached the food area noting there were only
five girls there without shopping bags. The short bulky creature
sneered through its smeared orange lipstick. The blue mascara was
chunky in its tattered eyelashes. The hot pink blush on its gray-green
cheeks was caked and cracking and the purple eye shadow was applied all
the way to its temples. The blue frizzy hair had a number of non
matching bows and clips tangled in it. It pointed ears were pierced
dozens of times though none of the gaudy earrings matched. Its thick
muscular neck was adorned with twenty or so necklaces including three
chokers; one purple velvet, one hemp, and one of metal balls. Its
clothing was a montage of different fabric and colors. The frills,
ruffles, and trim moved slightly in a nonexistent breeze. It had a blue
and orange striped sleeve covering one arm. The other was bare
revealing an arm like that of a bodybuilder. The delicate pink lace
covering its shoulder was a stark contrast to its masculine build. The
skirt had a multitude of pleats and was yellow with olive green polka
dots. The bottom was lined with multicolored plastic strips that you
usually see on the handle bars of banana seat bikes for children. The
lavender fishnet pantyhose covered a set of muscle bound legs. One foot
was incased in four inch, red and gold snakeskin, stiletto heel while
the other had a knee high heavily laced dominatrix black leather boot.
Scarves, anklets, and bracelets adorned every available extremity. An
infinite amount of gaudy rings adorned its fingers.

&quot;Oooooo I sthee you have sthome accesthories I can use. You in the red,
I want your tiara. That visor would look wonderful with it, bluebell.&quot;
It turned from Mercury and looked over Sailor Moon and Venus. &quot;And
those red balls in your odangos will look abstholutely fabulousth with your
red bow. Nice bleach job by the way, did you do each other?&quot; Its voice
was masculine but it was speaking in falsetto using sing-songy
inflection. Lastly it viewed Jupiter. &quot;Hunny, you definitely need some
pointersth on feminine fashion. Those bootsth have to go and that hair
just sthcreamsth tom-boy. Darling I am a queen but you are definitely
no king!&quot; It flicked one wrist and snapped while the other hand rested
on its hip.

Mars and Mercury stood unmoving, but Jupiter was springing with a snarl
and clenched fists at the oddity. Venus and Sailor Moon screeched at
the youma in drag at the same time. &quot;IT&#39;S NATURAL. WE DON&#39;T BLEACH!&quot;
All hell was about to break loose.

The youma&#39;s speed allowed it to dodge Jupiter&#39;s punches. It sped to the
other side of the court near Venus. &quot;Give me back my stuff! That
bracelet is mine and so it that belt!&quot; She launched several acrobatic
Venus kicks and chops at the thing yet it still was too fast. It
retaliated with a deadly attack.

&quot;Clubbing Music!&quot; Disco type lights filled the area and music started
playing. Cher&#39;s voice rose as &quot;Believe&quot; began roaring out of the
youma&#39;s purse.

Jupiter covered her ears and Venus gritted her teeth as she fell to her
knees. Mercury held her forehead as Mars readied her flame sniper.
Usagi was in the back dancing mindlessly.

Mars got her attack off before the music incapacitated her. And the
flaming arrow demolished the frightening purse. She looked over at
Usagi who seemed to be lost and pouting over the end of the song.

Venus sent her love me chain after the thing as Jupiter hurled a few
sparkling wide pressures in front of it. Mercury was busy trying to
find a weakness in, what her computer called, Draggeena.

&quot;Mars Fire Ignite!&quot;

&quot;Jupiter Thunder Crash!&quot;

&quot;Venus Crescent Beam Smash!&quot;

They all hit Draggeena at once. What was left was a sizzling mass of
crispy clothes and muscle and a very pissed off youma. The three scouts
looked at each other worriedly. Sure those were some of their weakest
attacks but it should have done more damage than that. &quot;Mercury... do
you have anything yet?&quot; Mars asked nervously.

&quot;I&#39;m working on it. Just don&#39;t do that ag- What the..?!?&quot; her computer
started processing number that it shouldn&#39;t be. There was a great
energy shift. She looked back at the youma and watched in horror as it
transformed. What was left of the material ripped away as it tripled
in size. Its teal painted nails grew into hideous claws and sharp
spikes popped out all over its body.

&quot;I think we have have problem. Mercury you better find out what this
thing is weak against and fast. Rei you try and keep Usagi from getting
too close before she can use her attack. Jupiter help me keep it busy
so we can give Mercury some time.&quot; Venus gave out the orders and
everyone followed them.

They tag-teamed the new gruesome youma from opposite sides. They were
completely in synch knowing the others movement precisely. It was a
dance of light as they threw their attacks. The youma shielded itself
and became disoriented. All it wanted was to lash out and the
first thing it saw after being spun around by a Venus Love Me Chain was
Mars.

&quot;Diva Die!&quot; it screamed, its voice now very deep and rough. Dark energy
came from its taloned hands and encased the fire senshi. Outside the
encasement Sailor Moon could hear the soft playing of Celine Dion,
Madonna, Mariah Carey, and the greatest diva of them all... Elton John
playing all at once. To Mars however it was blaring at several
decibels. She crumbled to the ground pressing her hands over her ears
and screamed trying to drown the hellasious noise out with her own
voice.

Sailor Moon sent her tiara flying at the dome but no damage was done.
While her back was turned the youma sprang towards her. Venus was there
to knock her out of the way while Jupiter hit it dead in the chest with
a Thunder Dragon. Mercury saw this and blinked, then a smile formed
before she got back to her computer.

Mercury had found what she was looking for. &quot;Jupiter, use your
Sparkling Wide Pressure. and hit it in... the..er... groin area.&quot;
Sailor Moon looked at Mercury confused. &quot;When Jupiter hits it in its
&quot;privates&quot; use your Moon Scepter and destroy it.&quot; She turned to Venus,
&quot;Distract it so Jupiter can get a shot.&quot; She quickly went over to the
dome and began finding a way to break it open.

Venus has an eerie evil smile on her face. &quot;You think you&#39;re a queen?
Step aside girlfriend and watch this diva work it. In the name of
Venus, Goddess of love, beauty, and fashion. I will punish you!&quot; She
turned to Mercury and nodded. Slowly but clearly strands of saxophone
music began to emanate from her computer. Venus struck a pose and began
singing.

The body&#39;s beautiful baby
That&#39;s right I just can&#39;t help it
It&#39;s not my fault, I was born this way

The youma was about to charge and Venus held up one finger stopping it
for a moment and continued.

Get with the B- E -A -U -T -Y
Beauty the body is beautiful

She gestured with her hands to her own body.

I&#39;m up and coming, I am a child
I&#39;m legendary, hey, I&#39;m free and wild
I am the ocean, and I rule the world
I&#39;m sensual, I am body beautiful

She sashayed over to bench and flipped up to it. Putting her hand on
her hip she turned back to Drageena.

My cha-cha pumps

Sailor Moon began to sing backup.

(hump-a-dooty),
I&#39;ve got them on
(in a winnin&#39; ticket)
And I work the runway
(left-right-left-right-left)
baby, all night long
I am the one
(the only one)
There is no other
I am mother, I am body beautiful

The youma looked on, its eyes glowing peculiarly... entranced. The dome
that held Mars vanished. Mercury checked to make sure she was stable
before motioning to Jupiter to make her attack. What she got in return
was the brunette waving her off as she continued to watch Venus in
action.

Lights, camera, action!
Satisfaction guaranteed, that&#39;s what I need
I celebrate the body and enjoy good health
And I gets down with my bad self

Venus knew she had a great body and was now shamelessly flaunting it.
Living with Artemis had some effect on her because the sensual roll of
her hips and arch of her back were almost cat like in nature.

It&#39;s all good from the front to the back Two snaps and a clap for a
body like that It&#39;s a good damn thing I don&#39;t care what you say
Somebody beautiful hey, that&#39;s me

The youma had its full attention on Venus as she walked toward Jupiter
with Sailor Moon circling behind her.

I am grand
(grand diva),
I am the queen
(Queen Bee)
A masquerade
(who am I?),
I&#39;m fantasy
Sailor Moon placed her hand on Makoto&#39;s shoulder and whispered to her.
(your fantasy)
I am the house
(the whole mansion)
of elegance
Featuring, I am body beautiful
(body beautiful)

Venus and Sailor Moon turned back to Draggena having its full
attention.

Don&#39;t hate me cuz I&#39;m beautiful
Everybody&#39;s beautiful in their own special way

Drageena was listening and whispered excitedly back, &quot;Yes.&quot;

Carry yourself like a queen and you will attract a king
Beauty comes from within

&quot;Yes&quot;

Whatever the mind can conceive and believe
You will achieve

It held its hands clenched in front of its chest, eyes shining with
hope, &quot;Got to believe.&quot;

Do you believe

&quot;Yes&quot;

that you are body beautiful?

&quot;Yes! Yess! Oooo, yessss!&quot; The youma was almost begging

&quot;Jupiter pick you chin up off the floor and hit it!&quot; Mercury whispered
harshly. But the thunder senshi had also been entranced by the love
goddess. Mercury let out an exasperated sigh. Her attacks would be
useless against the youma. &quot;Sailor Moon!&quot; but the blonde ignored her.
The blue haired senshi glared at Minako who just winked back.

The youma was disabled but it was still a threat. Venus narrowed her
eyes. &quot;You will pay for stealing and wearing my NEW things before I got
the chance! Venus Love and Beauty Shock!&quot; Drageena never knew what hit
him and with a shriek disintegrated into dust.
