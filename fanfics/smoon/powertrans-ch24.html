<h1>Power Transcendent (part 24 of 31)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jessica.html">Jessica</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/powertrans-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>Ami quickly slid the sliding glass door open, feeling the chill winter 
wind enter her room and whirl around her nightgown-clad form. It was 
bitter cold, but as always she registered it as little more than 
uncomfortably cool.

Sailor V just smiled at her, lowering the flower she held in her hand 
slightly. The moonlight shone down behind her, catching in her hair as 
it streamed out in the wind and illuminating her in silvery-gray tones. 
She looked like a ghost, a vision out a dream. -Or a fantasy.- A part of 
Ami&#39;s mind whispered at her teasingly, and she blushed in response. 

Then Sailor V was walking towards her. She lifted the white lily...Ami&#39;s 
favorite flower...and gently touched it to Ami&#39;s lips. With hands that 
shook gently, she cupped the hand that held the blossom, feeling 
Minako&#39;s warmth through the white glove. &quot;Am I still really cool?&quot; 
Sailor V asked in a voice just over a whisper, a light smile playing 
across her face. 

Ami smiled shyly, feeling that blush climbing her cheeks again. &quot;Of 
course.&quot; She murmured. Sailor V handed her the flower and she held it to 
her breast. &quot;How did you get this?&quot; She asked softly, looking down at 
the lily.

Sailor V chuckled. &quot;I got lucky.&quot; She said, thinking of someone who left 
a vase full of them on their balcony about ten floors down. Those that 
remained would be frostbitten by morning, so she didn&#39;t think that the 
one would be missed. 

&quot;I...&quot; Ami looked to the other girl, down to the flower and back again. 
She seemed lost for words. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re here...&quot; Sailor V 
stepped right up against her and slid an arm around her waist, using the 
other to gently stroke her cheek. 

&quot;I wanted to be with you tonight.&quot; She murmured. &quot;I needed to be.&quot;

Ami smiled into Sailor V&#39;s eyes for a moment before sliding her arms 
loosely around her neck. They embraced warmly for a moment, and then 
Sailor V found Ami&#39;s lips with hers and for awhile, there was nothing 
else. 

Then the wind suddenly gusted around them, and Ami felt Sailor V shiver. 
She broke the kiss with a tiny chuckle, her voice a bit breathless. 
&quot;Should we go inside?&quot; The other girl nodded, and as they walked through 
the doorway Ami thought to ask, &quot;How did you get up here anyway?&quot;

&quot;I climbed.&quot; Sailor V said with a shrug. Ami blinked in shock and she 
turned around, rushing to the balcony to look down. 

&quot;You *climbed*!&quot; She gasped. 

&quot;Well, I guess I jumped.&quot; Sailor V said, miming jumping with her hand as 
she approached the balcony again. Ami just looked back and forth between 
the street far below and her love, aghast. 

&quot;Mina-chan this is the penthouse! Do you have any idea how high up we 
are?&quot; 

&quot;I jumped it, remember?&quot; Sailor V said, sounding faintly amused. 
&quot;Believe me, I know.&quot; For the first time Ami noticed that her breathing 
was a bit labored and her cheeks were pink with exertion, more than just 
from their kiss. Ami laughed helplessly and hugged her tightly, slowly 
backing her through the doorway. 

&quot;You&#39;re crazy!&quot; She exclaimed, her voice muffled in Sailor V&#39;s shoulder. 
&quot;You could have killed yourself.&quot; Sailor V put her hands on Ami&#39;s waist 
and kissed her forehead. 

&quot;It was worth it for the look in your eyes.&quot; She murmured. Ami laughed 
again and turned her face up to look at her. 

&quot;Crazy.&quot; She said softly, shaking her head with a smile. She gave her 
another brief kiss before slipping away to look into the hallway, making 
sure her mother hadn&#39;t been disturbed. She heard nothing, so went back 
inside, closing and locking the door behind her, just in case, just as 
Sailor V was closing the door to the balcony.  

Ami walked over to her desk and carefully placed the lily in a bowl of 
flowers that was already there, arranging it so it sat in the center of 
the other blooms. As she did so, she felt Sailor V slip behind her, 
placing her hands on Ami&#39;s stomach as she placed her chin on her 
shoulder. Ami turned to face her, lifting her hand to remove the blonde 
hero&#39;s goggles and place them on the desk. &quot;Sailor V...&quot; She whispered, 
cupping her love&#39;s cheeks in her hands with a smile. &quot;But I love you as 
Minako most of all.&quot;

In response, Sailor V closed her eyes and smiled. There was a soft 
golden glow, and then Minako was in her arms. Ami noted that it looked 
like Minako had dressed rather hurriedly, just wearing a t-shirt with a 
short skirt and black legwarmers. Looking into her eyes, Ami was also 
surprised to see hurt there. It wasn&#39;t directed at her, but she thought 
it was probably part of what had brought Minako to her that night. 

She didn&#39;t ask, though. Minako might not want to talk about it. That 
hurt a little, Ami had to admit, and she wished that Minako could open 
up to her a little more. But she&#39;d come to Ami for comfort, and for now, 
that was enough. 

Silently, Ami took Minako&#39;s hand and led her to her unmade bed. They 
both lay on their sides, close but not quite touching, just looking into 
each other&#39;s eyes in the dim light from outside, drinking in the emotion 
that dwelt there. Ami felt Minako&#39;s hand caress her face with a feathery 
touch, as if she were something rare and beautiful that could break with 
a careless touch. Ami smiled a little, as she felt that description more 
belonged to Minako herself, even if she didn&#39;t know it. 

Minako opened her mouth and started to speak, but then closed and 
swallowed. She took a deep breath, her eyes never leaving Ami&#39;s, and 
spoke again. &quot;I had a fight with my mom tonight.&quot; She whispered. And she 
began to tell the story. She kept looking into Ami&#39;s eyes, and Ami could 
see the obvious effort it was taking Minako to do so. 

Ami listened carefully, keeping her expression gentle and attentive. -
She&#39;s doing this for me!- Part of her mind exulted. -No.- She told 
herself. -She&#39;s doing this for her. She&#39;s tired of holding her hurt 
inside and letting it poison her. But she&#39;s doing this *because* of me. 
Because she trusts me. Because, at last, she&#39;s found someone she can 
really confide in.- And that thought sent a deep, warm rush through 
Ami&#39;s body. 

As Minako related her final remark to her mother and her rush back to 
her room, her voice broke, and a tear slid down her cheek. Ami slid her 
arms protectively around her and pulled her close, kissing the tear away. 
Minako drew in a shaky breath and buried her face in Ami&#39;s shoulder, who 
turned onto her back to let Minako lay against her. She felt wetness on 
her shoulder and Minako&#39;s shoulders began to shake silently. 

Ami just held her, stroking her long golden hair as she let the other 
girl cry herself out. She realized then just how much Minako relied on 
her, how much she needed someone she could learn to trust, to love. It 
made her feel very protective, but at the same time a flash of doubt 
sent a shiver through her heart. Despite all she had survived, Ami still 
had trouble thinking of herself as a strong person, and she worried 
suddenly if she had the inner strength to be the one Minako needed. 

But then Minako was looking up at her, and the doubts were chased away 
as she saw the look in her eyes. For this girl, Ami could be anything. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Mina-chan.&quot; She whispered, stroking her hair again. 

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Minako sighed and laid the side of her head against Ami&#39;s 
shoulder, her fingers lightly playing with the lace trim on Ami&#39;s 
nightgown. &quot;We have this fight each time she tries something like this. 
I wish she&#39;d just give it up.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Ami said softly, musing. &quot;I think it might show that 
she cares, in a way.&quot; Minako looked up at her disbelievingly, and Ami 
smiled and shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m not defending her...from the little I&#39;ve 
seen of her, and what you&#39;ve told me, I really don&#39;t like her. And she&#39;s 
been a terrible, shameful excuse for a parent.&quot; Minako&#39;s eyes softened, 
and that alone made Ami sad for her...that her relationship with her 
mother was that bad. 

&quot;But I still think it shows that she cares, deep down, beneath all the 
selfishness and shallowness.&quot; Minako puffed out her cheeks and sighed. 

&quot;Maybe that&#39;s right...maybe I even know it, and that&#39;s why I feel so 
guilty whenever we fight like this.&quot;

&quot;Maybe.&quot; Ami agreed gently. &quot;And maybe it might be a chance to sit down 
and talk with her.&quot; She ran her fingers lightly through Minako&#39;s silken 
hair. &quot;I hate seeing you so upset, Mina-chan.&quot; She murmured. 

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Minako sighed again. &quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;re ever going to be 
friends. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d even want that anymore.&quot; She gave a weak 
little chuckle and turned her eyes up once again. &quot;At this point I&#39;d 
settle for not screaming at each other if we&#39;re in the same room.&quot;

Ami chuckled in return. &quot;That would be nice.&quot; She nodded. &quot;I love you 
Minako.&quot;

Minako replied by inching up a bit until their faces met and looking 
again into Ami&#39;s eyes. Ami could see her love reflected there, and 
smiled. Ami offered up her lips, and Minako accepted them eagerly, 
bringing them into a kiss that made the room spin around her. The kiss 
was more than passionate, it was hungry, and Ami returned it fervently. 
A *very* faint voice warned her that she needed to be careful, that in 
the wake of the churning emotions Minako&#39;s confession had engendered 
there was a great danger of the two of them losing control. 

For the time being Ami chose to ignore that voice. 

Instead, the kiss deepened even further, and Ami felt Minako&#39;s hands 
sliding against her. Then Minako&#39;s lips left her, and a small sigh of 
disappointment escaped her, only to turn into a sharp gasp as Minako 
found her neck. Her eyes fluttered closed and she tilted her head to the 
side, arching her back up against Minako&#39;s body.

A small bite sent an electric shock through Ami&#39;s body, and she moaned 
gently in response. Minako&#39;s hand suddenly covered her mouth, and she 
could feel more than hear the blonde senshi giggle against her neck. A 
sudden fear of a mark she couldn&#39;t hide brought Ami back to herself just 
enough to see what they had been doing. 

She realized with a small shock that her nightgown had been pushed up 
over her hips and that Minako&#39;s hands were caressing her beneath the 
rest. And with an equal amount of surprise, Ami found her hands on 
Minako&#39;s hips and realized that she had pushed her skirt down to her 
knees. 

Quickly, Ami pulled her neck away from Minako&#39;s mouth. Minako chased it 
for a moment, but then Ami placed her hands on Minako&#39;s shoulders. 
&quot;Mina-chan...&quot; She said, panting softly. Part of her absolutely hated 
herself for what she was about to say. &quot;We should stop.&quot;

Minako stopped and slowly removed her hands from beneath Ami&#39;s 
nightgown. She used them to lever herself over Ami a bit and look into 
her eyes. There was barely restrained desire burning in them, and Ami 
shivered a little, realizing that her eyes must be much the same. Then a 
flicker of surprise appeared on the blonde girl&#39;s face as she realized, 
as Ami had, how far things had gone. 

&quot;Wow...&quot; Minako whispered softly, laying against Ami&#39;s side with her 
head resting gently on her shoulder. 

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Ami agreed, squirming a bit to help her pull her nightgown down 
once again. She tilted her head to the side. &quot;Mina-chan...make sure you 
didn&#39;t leave a mark.&quot; 
 
&quot;Right.&quot; Minako wriggled up again to look. There was a long pause. When 
she spoke again, her voice sounded a little nervous and a little amused. 
&quot;Well...&quot;

&quot;Minako!&quot; Ami groaned softly, clapping a hand to her neck. &quot;I don&#39;t have 
long hair! What am I going to do?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s pretty close to the shoulder...maybe nobody will notice.&quot; Minako 
replied, still sounding amused. 

&quot;I&#39;m glad you think this is funny...&quot; Ami grumbled, blushing. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Ami.&quot; Minako whispered huskily, her hand tiptoeing across 
Ami&#39;s stomach. The blue haired girl&#39;s breath suddenly caught in her 
throat. She felt Minako&#39;s warm breath on her ear. &quot;Let me make it up to 
you...&quot; 

Minako lightly sucked Ami&#39;s earlobe into her mouth and Ami gasped, 
grabbing Minako&#39;s shoulder tightly. Her blood started pounding in her 
ears once again, and as she felt Minako&#39;s teeth against her sensitive 
skin she moaned loudly. &quot;Mina-chan!&quot;

Immediately Minako&#39;s hand was over her mouth and Minako was looking into 
her eyes, laughing silently. &quot;Ami! You&#39;re too loud!&quot; She whispered. 

Ami blushed deeply. &quot;We should stop anyway, remember?&quot; She whispered 
back. 

Minako bit her lip guiltily and nodded. &quot;Right...&quot; She sighed languidly 
and cuddled to Ami&#39;s side. &quot;Sorry Ami.&quot; She said softly. 

Ami smiled a little. &quot;Don&#39;t be...I didn&#39;t want to stop either...but...&quot; 
She trailed off, and Minako nodded again. 

&quot;I understand...I feel the same way.&quot; She began kicking her feet and Ami 
looked down at her curiously. Minako smiled up at her. &quot;Sorry...I just 
hate laying in bed with a skirt on.&quot; She winked teasingly. &quot;And it was 
riding pretty low anyway.&quot;

Ami nodded with a smile, blushing softly. She turned her head into 
Minako&#39;s hair, taking a deep breath as she enjoyed its warm fragrance. 
She felt Minako&#39;s arms tightening slightly around her as they snuggled 
against one another. The burning desire she had felt just minutes ago 
was finally fading, leaving a powerful warmth and contentment in it&#39;s 
place. It occurred to Ami then that she couldn&#39;t remember ever being so 
happy as she felt in that moment. 

&quot;I&#39;m glad you came tonight.&quot; She whispered into Minako&#39;s hair. &quot;You make 
me so happy.&quot;

&quot;Thank you Ami.&quot; Minako replied, cuddling closer. &quot;Thank you...for 
everything.&quot;

-------------------

Minako cracked her eyes open blearily. Something woke her up...what was 
it?

&quot;Ami! Are you awake?&quot;

Never in her life had Minako gone from sleep to full wakefulness in such 
a short amount of time. She sat bolt upright, looking around wildly. She 
felt panic rising in her throat as she saw the sunlight streaming into 
the bedroom.  When had she gone to sleep? There was another knock at the 
door. 

&quot;Come on sleepy...you&#39;ll be late at this rate!&quot;

Minako turned to Ami to wake her, and paused. The blue haired girl was 
smiling sweetly in her sleep, and looked so heart-stoppingly lovely that 
just for a moment Minako forgot everything else. 

Then Ami&#39;s mother shook the doorknob and brought reality crashing back. 
Minako knew that Ami wanted her mother to know about the two of them, 
but she was positive that the discovery of a half-naked Aino Minako in 
her daughter&#39;s bed was not how Ami wanted her to find out. 

&quot;Ami!&quot; She hissed, lightly shaking her girlfriend&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Ami, you 
gotta wake up!&quot;

Ami stirred and opened her eyes. She saw Minako and for an instant her 
smile was like the sun coming up. Then panic flooded her features. 

&quot;Mizuno Ami!&quot; Her mother&#39;s voice sounded again, sterner this time. She 
knocked a bit harder. &quot;You can&#39;t leave your door locked if you&#39;re going 
to study all night! Wake up!&quot;

&quot;I...I&#39;m awake!&quot; Ami called out, trying to keep her voice from shaking. 
&quot;I&#39;ll be out in just a minute!&quot;

&quot;Alright...breakfast will be ready soon.&quot; Minako heard footsteps fading 
down the hallway. She and Ami stared at each other for a moment.

Then both leapt out of bed. Ami rushed to the closet and Minako got on 
her knees, looking around the bed for her skirt. She found it, but as 
she was pulling it on Ami came back. &quot;No...here!&quot; She hissed, pushing a 
school uniform into Minako&#39;s arms. &quot;We&#39;re almost the same size, so it 
should fit. If we&#39;re careful, we might be able to sneak you out of 
here.&quot; 
 
Minako had a slightly dazed expression on her face. &quot;But...I don&#39;t have 
my bag...&quot; 
 
&quot;We can pick it up on the way to school, right?&quot; Minako nodded. &quot;Good.&quot; 
Ami placed her hands on Minako&#39;s shoulders and turned her around. &quot;No 
peeking.&quot; She admonished, then took a second to lean over and give the 
blonde girl a kiss on the cheek. &quot;I&#39;m still glad you came.&quot; She said 
softly, and Minako smiled. 

&quot;So am I.&quot; They both changed into Ami&#39;s school uniform, and though 
sorely tempted, Minako avoided the urge to peek. Ami was just slightly 
taller than her, and with a rueful smile she realized that the blouse 
was noticeably loose around the chest, but overall it wasn&#39;t a bad fit.

Ami was at her bedroom door, peeking out. She turned back, looking 
pensive. &quot;Alright...I&#39;ll go eat. I&#39;ll try to go slow so Mom finishes 
first and heads into the bathroom. Then, I&#39;ll come get you and we can 
get you outside.&quot; 
 
&quot;Sounds like a plan.&quot; Minako smiled, and Ami gave her a quick hug, which 
Minako returned with a kiss. &quot;Good luck!&quot; She whispered. Ami nodded and 
took a deep breath. She left the bedroom trying to look as if she were 
still bleary and waking up. Minako listened at the door after she left, 
but couldn&#39;t hear anything more than muffled muttering. She went back to 
the bed and sat down, tapping her hands against her legs nervously.  

-Still glad you came?- The little voice in her mind asked. 

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Minako murmured to herself. &quot;Yeah, I am.&quot; She smiled a little. 
&quot;This is even kind of fun. Sort of exhilarating, you know?&quot;

-So you don&#39;t mind that Ami&#39;s mother might find out about you?- Minako 
felt a quick, icy stab of fear at that thought. 

&quot;Well...I didn&#39;t say that. It&#39;s still *way* too soon for that. Even Ami 
thinks so.&quot;

-Are you sure about that? After all, she doesn&#39;t know about your doubts 
and fears about yourself, does she? And if it wasn&#39;t for that, what 
would be holding you back?-

&quot;Well...nothing.&quot; Minako curled her knees up until her chin was resting 
on top of them. She didn&#39;t really want to think about any of this right 
now. She tried to concentrate on listening to the dim sounds of 
conversation from the kitchen once again. 

-You&#39;re braver than you think, Minako. In the end, the only one you&#39;re 
afraid of admitting your feelings to is yourself.-

&quot;What&#39;s that supposed to...&quot; Minako paused, a sudden feeling of cold 
confusion settling over her. &quot;Was that my thought?&quot; She whispered, 
looking around. -Hello?- She called out into the vaults of her mind. -Is 
anyone there?- 

Nothing...at least nothing that felt out of the ordinary. She looked 
around nervously and closed her eyes, listening now to her own thoughts, 
for anything that felt like it wasn&#39;t hers. Just as she decided the 
excitement of the morning was making her paranoid, the doorknob began to 
open. Taken completely by surprise, Minako tried to jump up and 
succeeded in tumbling over the side of the bed in an undignified heap. 

&quot;Mina-chan?&quot; Ami whispered, closing the door behind her and looking 
around. Minako lifted her hand to wave at Ami from the other side of the 
bed. The blue-haired girl rushed over and took her arm, helping her up. 
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; She asked, smoothing out the sleeves on her uniform. 

&quot;Fine...you just kind of took me by surprise.&quot; Minako smiled, and Ami 
nodded. 

&quot;Hurry...Mom&#39;s in the bathroom. I&#39;ll meet you downstairs, okay?&quot; Minako 
nodded, and the quietly rushed to the apartment door. Ami held it open 
and Minako stepped past her, giving her a quick peck on the lips as she 
did so. 

&quot;Ami?&quot; Dr. Mizuno stepped into the living room. &quot;Is someone at the 
door?&quot; Ami&#39;s eyes widened and she looked at Minako, who gave her a 
helpless shrug. 

&quot;Um...yes, Mom. It&#39;s Minako.&quot;  
 
Wearing what she hoped would read as a casual smile, Minako stepped back 
inside &quot;So close!&quot; She mouthed to Ami as she was passing her. &quot;Hello Dr. 
Mizuno.&quot; She said, bowing politely. 

&quot;Minako-chan, good morning!&quot; Dr. Mizuno returned the bow with a smile. 
&quot;It&#39;s nice to see you again. Ami is usually the one to pick you up, 
isn&#39;t she?&quot;

&quot;Yes...but I woke up early this morning and couldn&#39;t get back to sleep.&quot; 
Minako smiled a bit more genuinely. It always felt better when she could 
twist the truth rather than tell an absolute lie. 

&quot;Well, if you had come just a few minutes earlier, Ami would still be 
asleep!&quot; Dr. Mizuno covered her mouth and chuckled, and Minako was 
suddenly struck by how much her mannerisms matched Ami&#39;s. &quot;You *will* 
get to sleep earlier tonight, won&#39;t you Ami?&quot;

Ami nodded quickly. &quot;Of course.&quot; She said with a smile. She picked up 
her bag from a nearby armchair. &quot;Well, we should probably get going...&quot; 

&quot;You haven&#39;t brushed your teeth yet.&quot; Dr. Mizuno reminded Ami gently. 
Fortunately Minako had been leaving once again and her huge wince was 
hidden by the door. 

&quot;Oh, right!&quot; Ami said, laughing softly. Her expression was natural, but 
her eyes looked strained. Minako hoped her mother didn&#39;t notice. &quot;Where 
is my head this morning?&quot;

&quot;More sleep, Mizuno-san.&quot; Dr. Mizuno said in a mock-severe tone. Ami 
gave Minako one more look, as if to say &#39;I&#39;ll be back soon!&#39; and hurried 
back into the hallway, leaving Minako alone with her mom. There was a 
moment of quiet. 

&quot;How is Rei?&quot; Dr. Mizuno asked. &quot;She&#39;s due to get those stitches looked 
at tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Oh...&quot; Minako smiled a bit. &quot;I don&#39;t know how well you know Rei, but 
she&#39;s handling being hurt about as well as you&#39;d expect.&quot;

Ami&#39;s mother chuckled again. &quot;Oh, yes. I can imagine. But is she alright 
otherwise?&quot; She seemed worried. &quot;It was such a strange wound.&quot; 
 
-She cares enough to actually worry about Ami&#39;s friends.- Minako thought 
with a wistful mental sigh, then nodded. &quot;Oh yes...just eager to take 
the stitches out and get back to normal.&quot;

&quot;Right...&quot; Dr. Mizuno trailed off thoughtfully, and Minako hoped that 
Ami would return soon. This woman was too sharp for Minako&#39;s comfort. 
&quot;On that subject, how are your ribs?&quot; Dr. Mizuno asked casually. 

&quot;Oh, they&#39;re fine.&quot; Minako said, unable to stop herself from letting the 
words tumble out. 

&quot;Fine? It&#39;s only been a few weeks.&quot; Dr. Mizuno lifted in eyebrow in 
surprise. Though, Minako thought with a cold feeling, it didn&#39;t look 
like she was all that surprised. 

&quot;Well...as fine as you could expect...&quot; She said with a rueful smile, 
patting her side for demonstration. &quot;They really only hurt if I put a 
strain on them.&quot;

&quot;Ah...that&#39;s good then. It sounds like they&#39;ll be completely healed 
before too long.&quot; She smiled a bit. &quot;Something told me you&#39;d heal fast.&quot; 

&quot;I guess I eat my vegetables.&quot; Minako said with a soft laugh, mentally 
berating herself for such a lame comment. Fortunately, Ami reappeared at 
that moment. 

&quot;Alright, I&#39;ll see you tonight Mom!&quot; Ami called over her shoulder, 
hustling Minako back through the doorway. 

&quot;Have a good day you two.&quot; Dr. Mizuno said cheerfully as the door closed 
behind them. They began walking faster and faster towards the elevators 
at the end of the hallway, to the point that they were practically 
sprinting when they reached them. As they stepped inside and the doors 
slid closed, they looked at each other and began laughing.

Minako leaned against the wall of the elevator, hugging herself. Ami 
stood by the button panel, holding her bookbag in front of her with both 
hands as her shoulders shook with helpless laughter. &quot;Oh...oh my God, I 
can&#39;t believe we got away with it!&quot; Minako laughed. 

&quot;I know...I thought we were doomed for sure when my mom came out!&quot; Ami 
said, tears of laughter on her cheeks. &quot;And you almost fell over when 
she reminded me to brush my teeth!&quot;

&quot;How many times did escape have to be snatched from my grasp!&quot; Minako 
moaned comically, miming grabbing something. She stood up straight and 
walked over to Ami, giving her an exuberant hug. &quot;You did great!&quot; She 
said, kissing her softly. 

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Ami said, blushing shyly. She returned the kiss. 
&quot;Oh...here.&quot; She reached into her bag and pulled out a hard-boiled egg 
wrapped in napkins. &quot;I was able to smuggle this away from breakfast. 
It&#39;s better than nothing, right?&quot; 
 
&quot;Much!&quot; Minako said, suddenly remembering that an early dinner yesterday 
was the last time she had eaten. She devoured the egg in just a couple 
of bites. &quot;Much better.&quot; She smiled. &quot;Thank you Ami...it was really 
sweet of you to think to take that.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; Ami said, blushing again. 

The elevator reached the lobby, and the two girls left the apartment 
building, heading down the sidewalk towards Minako&#39;s house. They walked 
side by side in silence for a couple of minutes, in the cold winter 
sunshine.

&quot;You&#39;re right, by the way.&quot; Minako finally said. &quot;Your mother knows 
something...or suspects something, at least. About the Sailor Senshi, I 
mean.&quot; 
 
&quot;Why?&quot; Ami asked nervously. &quot;What did she say?&quot; Minako gave her a quick 
sketch of the conversation and Ami sighed once she was finished. &quot;I&#39;ll 
have to tell her soon.&quot; She said in a tired voice. &quot;About everything.&quot;

&quot;Just wait a little longer.&quot; Minako urged, a sudden surge of panic 
making her feel an equally strong surge of guilt. &quot;I know it&#39;s hard, Ami. 
And I know it&#39;s not fair to you...but please, just a little longer. I&#39;ll 
be ready soon...I&#39;m sorry...&quot;

Ami sighed deeply, watching the steam of her breath dissipate. &quot;Alright 
Mina-chan.&quot; She said with a small smile. &quot;When you&#39;re ready.&quot; She looked 
at the sidewalk worriedly. &quot;I just hope she doesn&#39;t decide she&#39;s sure 
enough to confront me first.&quot;

&quot;She won&#39;t...I promise we&#39;ll tell her everything before that.&quot; Minako 
said with a small smile. Ami smiled wanly back, and Minako felt guilt 
stabbing at her once again. -It *has* to be soon.- She told herself 
angrily. She reached out and found Ami&#39;s hand, giving it a small squeeze. 
Ami blinked up at her and gave her a full smile, squeezing her hand back.

&quot;I know it&#39;s not something we can do often.&quot; Ami said softly a few 
minutes later. &quot;But I really enjoyed sleeping with you. It felt so 
nice...&quot;

&quot;I know...&quot; Minako smiled as well, a small blush on her cheeks. &quot;That 
made the panic this morning totally worth it. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever 
slept so well. I didn&#39;t even have that dream...&quot; She suddenly felt silly 
bringing *that* up and let the sentence trail away. 

&quot;What dream?&quot; Ami asked, and Minako waved her free hand dismissively.  

&quot;Oh...nothing. Just a stupid dream I&#39;ve been having lately that wakes me 
up. It&#39;s probably just because I&#39;m worried about the new enemies.&quot; Ami 
nodded and squeezed her hand a little tighter. 

&quot;Well, give me a call the next time you have it. Maybe it will make you 
feel better.&quot; Minako blushed deeply and smiled softly over at her 
girlfriend. 

&quot;You really are too sweet.&quot; She said softly. &quot;Thank you Ami.&quot; 
 
&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; Ami said, looking lovingly back into her eyes. 

&quot;Last night probably spoiled me.&quot; Minako said with a chuckle. &quot;I&#39;m 
probably never going to feel rested again unless I&#39;m sleeping with you.&quot;

&quot;Oh *really* now?&quot; A sudden voice from above them made both girls jump. 
Artemis was sitting atop the wall next to the sidewalk, cleaning his paw. 
&quot;The note you left said that you&#39;d be back before dawn, so I was getting 
worried.&quot; The white cat said, putting his paw down. &quot;But I guess there&#39;s 
no need to ask what you two have been up to, is there?&quot; He grinned down 
at the two of them. 

Minako felt her cheeks growing hot and saw that Ami was blushing 
furiously as well. &quot;That&#39;s not what I meant and you know it Artemis!&quot; 
She said, stomping her foot a bit at the insufferably smug looking cat. 

&quot;I don&#39;t know any such thing!&quot; Artemis said innocently, standing up and 
following them as they continued on walking down the sidewalk. &quot;Look, 
it&#39;s certainly none of my business, but maybe you should hold off on 
school nights, hm? You seem a little cranky.&quot; 

&quot;*Artemis*!&quot; Both Ami and Minako made identical shocked exclamations. 
That, apparently, was the breaking point for the white cat, who fell 
into such a raucous bout of laughter that he tumbled off the far side of 
the wall with a yowl. 

&quot;Serves you right cat!&quot; Minako said loftily, tossing back her long hair. 

&quot;You&#39;re a cruel woman Minako!&quot; Artemis called back, and Ami covered her 
mouth to laugh softly. Minako turned to look at Ami laugh and she leaned 
over to give the blue-haired girl a quick kiss on the lips. 

&quot;You&#39;re so pretty when you laugh.&quot; She said, and Ami blushed, still 
laughing. 

They continued on towards school by way of Minako&#39;s house, still hand in 
hand. Artemis still followed after them, chuckling at intervals, but 
they chose to take the high road and ignore the cat. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m such 
a pain sometimes.&quot; Minako said softly. &quot;Seeing you happy like that...I 
just wish I could make you happy all the time.&quot; 
 
Ami brought Minako&#39;s hand up to her mouth and kissed it. &quot;Don&#39;t be silly, 
Minako.&quot; She replied. &quot;You do.&quot;

AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE- Sometimes you feel like fluff! Sometimes you 
don&#39;t...Obviously, this is one of those times when I did. ^_^ I think in 
a way this might be the midpoint of the story, and I wanted to hit it on 
an up note. Hope you liked it! And if you&#39;ve been missing the Outer 
Senshi, don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be seeing a lot of them up ahead!
