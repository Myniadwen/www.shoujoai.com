<h1>Destiny or Duty (part 13 of 15)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kazeko.html">kazeko</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/destduty-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Haruka rolled her eyes at the little blonde&#39;s antics, amazed at how
quickly the group of younger girls had become a part of her life.  Usagi
was glaring at Rei as the miko tossed a bag of candy over her head,
Makoto catching it easily.  Ami rolled her eyes at the torture of the
blonde, returning to her studies.  Mamoru, a more recent addition to the
group, sat on the floor against the wall and discussed the lyrics of a
new song with Minako.  Earlier, Michiru and Haruka had helped her with
the music.  Michiru still wouldn&#39;t touch her violin, but three months
after that night, she was doing better.  She let Haruka touch her and
kiss her sometimes, no longer shying from Mamoru when he entered the
large apartment she shared with Haruka, but she still couldn&#39;t let her
guard down enough to let Haruka make love to her.  The blonde hoped that
she would keep improving.

Haruka returned to her sketch as an argument broke out between Rei and
Usagi, Makoto and Ami adding their own opinions as Minako moved closer.
She tried to ignore it as Michiru peeked into the living room, a tray of
snacks in her hands.  She placed them on the table near the arguing
girls and turned to leave as Usagi caught her hand.  &quot;Ne, Michiru-san?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Usagi-chan?&quot;

&quot;Where are all of your picture?&quot;

Michiru froze, shocked, and the other girls moved back, amazed that
Usagi would ask something like that.  Haruka put her paper down and
moved forward, reaching out toward her partner.  Michiru raised a hand
and closed her eyes, regaining her composure.  &quot;I haven&#39;t drawn anything
since we came to Tokyo, Usagi-chan.  As for the rest . . . most of them
are on display.&quot;

&quot;And the other ones?  The ones you did with Haruka-san?  The ones you
did of Haruka-san?  No one has seen them in a long time.&quot;

&quot;I put them away,&quot; Michiru whispered, moving closer to Haruka.

&quot;Maybe you should bring them back out,&quot; Rei whispered.  &quot;I know that I
would like to see them.  It&#39;s a shame to let talent die.&quot;

Haruka rested her hand on Michiru&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;You don&#39;t have to . . .
if you don&#39;t want to, Michiru.  It&#39;s up to you.&quot;

&quot;No, Haruka; I want to.  Let&#39;s go find those paintings.&quot;  As the couple
vanished deeper into their apartment, Minako and Makoto whirled on
Usagi.

&quot;Why would you ask her something like that?  That was insensitive,&quot; the
idol hissed.

&quot;I agree, Usagi-chan.  If Michiru-san wanted us to see her paintings,
she would have shown them to us.&quot;

&quot;No, Mako-chan.  She wouldn&#39;t.  She was hurt and she&#39;s healing very
slowly.  She put away her paints because it was her painting that kept
her from going with Haruka-san that day.  She blames her obsession for
what happened.&quot;

Mamoru shook his head.  &quot;You can&#39;t know that, Usagi.  She never told us
what happened the day she was attacked.  She won&#39;t talk about it.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t have to be told, Mamo-chan,&quot; Usagi whispered, closing her eyes
as images filled her mind.  She never even noticed her sudden use of
&#39;Mamo-chan&#39;.  &quot;She was drawing the sea, but it was unfinished.  She was
dissatisfied with the painting when she left, realizing that she had to
go or she would miss seeing Haruka-san win.  Haruka-san always won, and
Michiru-san liked to be there to congratulate her.  She never finished
that painting.&quot;

&quot;How do you know?  How could you possibly know?&quot;

&quot;I just see things, sometimes, Ami-chan.  And I saw this.&quot;

Michiru and Haruka reentered the room, ending the conversation, and all
eyes looked up as Michiru placed a covered canvas on the couch.  She
pulled the cloth away, sighing.  &quot;It&#39;s not finished.&quot;

&quot;The sea looks lonely,&quot; Minako whispered.  &quot;Maybe . . . maybe you
weren&#39;t meant to finish it then.  Sometimes I can&#39;t write and I have to
take a break.  When I return, I can finish those songs because the time
is better.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think I can paint just now . . .&quot;

&quot;Then let Haruka-san help you,&quot; Minako suggested.  &quot;I heard that your
joint paintings were breathtaking.&quot;

Haruka placed the picture she had carried on the floor in front of the
couch, braced against the legs of the table.  She removed the cover and
the girls gasped.  Even Mamoru was speechless.  It was the first picture
she and Michiru collaborated on, the picture of the angel and the
mermaid meeting on a rock at the edge of the ocean.  Usagi wiped a tear
out of her eye and shook her head.  &quot;You&#39;re work is so beautiful . . .
but so sad, too.  Their people will never let them be together.&quot;

Haruka stared at the blonde, shocked.  &quot;I never . . . I never thought
about that before.  You really think this picture is sad?&quot;

&quot;Well, I mean it&#39;s very beautiful, Haruka-san, and it&#39;s so sweet that
two people who are so very different can fall in love, and there&#39;s a lot
of hope, but their people will tear them apart.  I don&#39;t see a future.&quot;

Haruka felt tears fill her eyes at Usagi&#39;s words, taking a step back.
&#39;I don&#39;t see a future.&#39;  The words repeated over and over again in her
mind, reminding her that she and Michiru might not make it.  After all
they&#39;d been through, the rape might have been one straw too many.
Michiru sensed the direction Haruka&#39;s thoughts were wandering and placed
a gentle hand on her partner&#39;s arm.

&quot;I think that they would find a way to show their people that love is
stronger than any hatred that kept them apart and they would find a way
to be together.  Love is that strong.  It can get us through the
toughest times.&quot;  She moved backwards, letting Haruka wrap her arms
around her waist, resting her smaller hands on her lover&#39;s.  &quot;No matter
what may happen, love will pull us through.&quot;  She looked around at the
group, an idea filling her mind.  &quot;I know what&#39;s missing from the
picture,&quot; she whispered, slipping free of her lover&#39;s grasp and dashing
into the bedroom where her paints were.

Michiru set the canvas on an easel, carefully mixing her paints as
Haruka arranged the girls and Mamoru against the far wall.  She joined
them, sitting on the end of the row and leaving a space for Michiru
beside her.  After a little while&#151;and a few complaints from Usagi&#151;they
took a break and had a snack, the artists switching places.  As the
light outside faded, Haruka and Michiru labored over the painting,
finishing it as the girls napped, even Ami too tired to watch anymore.
Smiling, the artists brought out a clean canvas and began another
picture.

&quot;Haruka,&quot; Michiru whispered, pausing her hand.  They had sketched the
basic shape of Mamoru, the five girls, and themselves, but something
seemed a little odd to the aqua-haired woman.  &quot;There&#39;s someone
missing.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot;  Haruka took the pencil and added another tall woman, one with
long hair and a strange staff in one hand.  Michiru then added a small
girl beside the woman, her hair short, a scythe in her hand.  A few more
pencil lines had a mirror in her hand and a sword in Haruka&#39;s.  Driven
by a force and memories they did not understand, the pair painted the
group, putting them in strange sailor fuku, tiaras on their heads, a
black tuxedo suit and cape on Mamoru, hat on his head and a mask
covering his eyes.  Two cats sat silently at Usagi&#39;s booted feet.
Haruka never even complained when Michiru gave her a skirt, sensing that
it fit, somehow.  Hours later, finally finished, Haruka and Michiru woke
their guests and showed them the painting.

&quot;That&#39;s us,&quot; Usagi whispered, holding out her hand but not quite
touching.  &quot;But . . . we look like super-heroes.

&quot;Sailor fuku bishoujo senshi . . . that seems so familiar,&quot; Rei
whispered, staring at the figure that she had become.  She was wearing
red, high heels, gloves, a tiara . . . but it just seemed so right.

&quot;Ai to seigi no Sailor fuku bishoujo senshi Sailor Moon,&quot; Usagi
whispered.  &quot;Tsukini kawatte, oshiokiyo.&quot;  She moved into a pose that
seemed so very familiar, arms crossed in defense and defiance, feet
spread apart.  &quot;Sailor Moon.&quot;

&quot;Tuxedo Kamen,&quot; Mamoru murmured thoughtfully.  He noticed something
wrong, and he opened his mouth to speak, but the women beat him to it,
seven voices crying out at once.

&quot;The rose!  He should be holding a rose!&quot;  Michiru took her green paint
and slipped a thorn-free stem into Tuxedo Kamen&#39;s fingers, red paint
giving the flower a gentle bloom.  She touched up a few more things,
adding a crescent moon to each cat&#39;s forehead, before she stepped back.

&quot;But who are those two?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know who the woman is, Mako-chan, though it seems like I should
know her.  But the girl . . . she&#39;s the one in your article, Rei-chan.
That girl that died.&quot;

&quot;Tomoe Hotaru,&quot; Rei whispered.  &quot;Something is very wrong.&quot;

Minako shattered the moment with a huge yawn that she tried desperately
to stifle, sending Usagi into a fit of giggles.  Michiru glanced at the
clock as she headed to the bathroom to wash the paint off her hands,
Haruka following.  Rei pulled Usagi to her feet and headed for the guest
bedroom, Makoto, Ami, and Minako just behind them.  Mamoru had agreed to
sleep on the couch, fixing his bed as the girls went to fix theirs.
Makoto helped Ami spread the large futon on the floor, the pair talking
quietly as they slipped into their bed clothes.  Usagi was singing some
sort of song as she changed into her shirt and pajama pants, never
noticing Minako staring at Rei.  The miko did notice, trying her best to
ignore the idol as they finished dressing.  Minako rolled out her
sleeping bag in the corner, joking about foregoing her idol life to
sleep on the floor in someone else&#39;s apartment.

Usagi jumped into bed, grinning, as Rei shook her head and glanced at
Minako.  &quot;Usagi, Minako and I need to go talk for a minute.  Can you
wait for me?&quot;

&quot;Mochiron, Rei.&quot;  Makoto and Ami returned to the living room to help
Michiru and Haruka clean up as Rei and Minako headed for the balcony.
Usagi stared at the half-open door, wondering if she should go help, but
it sounded like the others were doing fine.  Besides, she was clumsy and
would probably do more harm than good.  Sighing in contentment, she
curled up and prepared to go to sleep.

&quot;Usagi?&quot;

&quot;Hai, Mamoru-san?&quot;  Usagi sat up as Mamoru sat on the edge of the bed,
staring at his hands.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;When I saw that picture, Usagi, I thought I could see another image.  A
princess.&quot;

&quot;I saw a prince,&quot; Usagi admitted.  &quot;I didn&#39;t want to say anything in
front of Rei because I think it would have upset her.  But I think that
prince was my destiny, and I think he was you, Mamoru.&quot;  She looked up
at him, tears in her eyes, carefree demeanor gone.  &quot;But it&#39;s too late
for us.  Maybe if we had met sooner than we did or one of us had seen
the possibility, but I&#39;m with Rei now, and I do love her.  I could never
betray her like that.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Mamoru whispered.  &quot;I think, in another life, I would have
been your prince.  But here and now, in real life, I am destined to be
alone.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mamoru.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not your fault,&quot; he whispered, cupping her cheek in his large
hand.  She covered his hand with her smaller one, tears filling her blue
eyes.  &quot;I think I knew that I liked you from the instant that test fell
on my head.  But sometimes we ignore Cupid&#39;s arrows and we never get a
second chance.  I was the stupid one.  I just wanted . . . just once . .
. can I kiss you?&quot;

Usagi nodded, closing her eyes as Mamoru&#39;s lips brushed hers, a spark of
destiny, of true belonging passing between them.  She stifled a sob as
he pulled away, standing up and leaving her alone.  Rolling over, she
closed her eyes and dried her tears, unwilling to upset Rei with her
despair.  Mamoru could have been hers . . . but something went wrong.
&quot;How can I love them both?&quot;

*~*~*~*~*~*~*

&quot;Minako, you&#39;re such a good friend, to all of us.  You and Usagi are so
much alike, and she&#39;s needed someone to get into mischief with.  The
rest of us are too dedicated to our studies and other things for her.
You gave up your carefree life to settle in Tokyo, go to school here,
and be with us.  I&#39;m grateful for that.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not only Usagi who keeps me here.&quot;

Rei sighed and leaned on the balcony railing, staring out at the city
lights, night in Tokyo.  Michiru could be heard through the open balcony
doors, scolding Haruka, Makoto and Ami laughing at the poor blonde.  &quot;I
know, Minako.  I know you think you love me . . .&quot;

&quot;I know I love you,&quot; Minako hissed, grabbing Rei and spinning her
around, trapping her against the railing.  Her face was mere inches from
the miko, the heat from her body washing over Rei.  &quot;Ever since the
moment I first saw you in the crowd, I knew that you were my destiny.  I
sang that song to you, Rei, no one else.  You know that, don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;I know.  I could tell.&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;re the woman from my dream!  Why can&#39;t we be together?&quot;

&quot;Because my heart is not whole,&quot; Rei whispered.  &quot;I love Usagi and I
have since we met, I think.  We had a wonderful relationship.  Even
Mamoru didn&#39;t make her look twice, and I think he really cares for her.
He&#39;s not part of our group because of me, I know.  But she&#39;s so loyal to
me, and she loves me so very much.  No matter what feelings I may have
for you, Minako, I loved Usagi first.&quot;

&quot;What feelings, Rei?  What do you feel for me?&quot;

Rei turned her head away.  &quot;I&#39;m not sure.&quot;

&quot;Yes you are!  Tell me!&quot;

&quot;Minako . . .&quot;

&quot;Tell me!  Do you love me?!&quot;

&quot;Yes!  Yes, damn it, I love you!  But I can&#39;t&#151;&quot;  She was silenced by
Minako&#39;s sudden kiss, gasping at the forcefulness of the blonde&#39;s
attack, relaxing as the other woman&#39;s tongue darted into her mouth,
experimenting.  Rei released her death-grip on the railing and slowly
slipped her fingers into Minako&#39;s soft hair.  So much like Usagi&#39;s . . .

&quot;No!&quot;  Rei jerked away, shame coloring her face, as she clenched her
fists.  &quot;This isn&#39;t right, Minako.  Please, go back in there.  I won&#39;t
do this to my girlfriend.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Minako whispered.

Rei turned to her and placed a gentle hand on her cheek.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry,
too, Minako.  I&#39;m sorry that we couldn&#39;t meet in a better place and
time.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll wait for you,&quot; Minako whispered.  &quot;If you and Usagi-chan ever
break up, I&#39;ll be there to help you through it.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot;  Rei kissed Minako&#39;s forehead and pushed the blonde back into
the apartment, staring out across the city one last time.  &quot;How can I
love them both?&quot;

Rei slipped back into the apartment and closed the balcony doors,
heading for the guest room without anyone noticing.  Ami put the last of
her books away, smiling as Makoto reached out a hand and helped her to
her feet.  Makoto wrapped her arm around Ami&#39;s waist and led the smaller
girl into the bedroom, the tenderness in such a simple gesture amazing
Haruka and Michiru.  Haruka smiled as she wrapped her arm around
Michiru&#39;s waist, slowly heading for their bedroom.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you started painting again,&quot; Haruka whispered.  &quot;Maybe
tomorrow we could get your violin out.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Michiru agreed.  &quot;I think running into Rei-chan and Minako-chan
is the best thing that ever happened to us.&quot;

&quot;I think you&#39;re right.&quot;

*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Minako squeezed her eyes shut, facing the wall, as Ami and Makoto
slipped under their blanket, curled up in each other&#39;s arms.  Rei was
still in the bathroom getting ready, and Minako knew that Usagi was
crying in the bed.  In the living room, she could hear Mamoru&#39;s restless
shuffling.  He was having troubles sleeping, too.  In the next room, she
heard Michiru and Haruka go to bed, just that.  They still didn&#39;t do
anything at night except sleep.  Somehow, that seemed wrong.  As Minako
fell asleep, she dreamed of a very different world where Rei was single
when Minako fell in love with her, Usagi was already taken by Mamoru,
and they spent their free time wondering about Haruka and Michiru&#39;s love
life.

Rei entered the bedroom as soon as she was sure that Makoto, Ami, and
Minako were asleep.  She slipped into bed beside Usagi, the drowsy
blonde curling into her girlfriend&#39;s arms automatically.  Her cheeks
were wet, and Rei knew that she had been crying.  Resting her head on
top of Usagi&#39;s, Rei closed her eyes and tried to relax.  &quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot;
she whispered.  &quot;I&#39;ll never do that to you again.&quot;</pre>
