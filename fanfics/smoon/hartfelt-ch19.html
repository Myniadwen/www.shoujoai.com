<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 19 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><p><u> (Hotaru, Uranus Shuttle)</u></p><p><b>Ping!</b></p><p>In one of the shuttles, 
Hotaru’s peaceful sleep was interrupted by a chill in the air. The girl groaned and rolled 
on her bed as if she were experiencing a nightmare. One of the two guards outside of her 
room thought they heard a noise from inside, but the other shook his head and reminded the 
man of their orders to stay put.</p><p>The feeling inside grew worse; Hotaru was beginning 
to perspire badly. But no one else on the shuttle was aware. In the dark-haired girl’s mind, 
she saw a tall, short-haired individual’s back. He was wearing a suit of armor, just like 
Haruka. But there were flames all around him. She quickly shook her head as the man slowly 
turned his head and looked at her from over his shoulder.</p><p>He smiled. “<i>Destroy 
everything… Kill all who stands in your way!”</i></p><p>Hotaru screamed as her body was 
enveloped by a dangerous, purple aura. The guards at the door jumped at the noise and rushed 
into the room just as Hotaru’s eyes snapped open. Suddenly, everything went 
white.</p><p>“AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!”</p><p><i><b>KabooM!</b></i></p><p>“What was that?!” 
Kali, Uranus’s field-commanding officer demanded. The crew around her were scrambling at 
their screens.</p><p>“I-I don’t know! One of our shuttles just disappeared off of the 
screen!”</p><p>“What did you say?!” <i>Is it the enemy?</i> “Which shuttle?!”</p><p>“I-I...” 
The woman stared hard at the officer and watched his face go white. “It was...Her Majesty’s. 
B-But Sir Haruka had already departed for battle, so it shouldn’t be a problem! We just need 
to alert all of the forces in the area, right?” Her subordinate was confused when he saw the 
angry frown on his superior’s face. “...Sir?”</p><p><i>...Shit! </i>Kali Auranos gritted her 
teeth. Although her staff had forgotten one, little, important detail, she 
hadn’t.</p><p>“Get me Sir Haruka on the line immediately!”</p><p>“But... Her Majesty is 
still hasn’t returned from battle! Do you really think it’s a wise idea to interrupt 
her--”</p><p>“JUST do it!”</p><p>“S-Sir!”</p><p>Kali bent over her screen and waited for the 
communications port to open. Haruka had better damn well answer.</p><p><i>That was no 
ordinary explosion. </i>That power surge she just felt, in the moment that the shuttle 
exploded still shook her to the core. <i>Damn it, Haruka! You better pick 
up!</i></p><p><u>(Haruka, Palace Courtyard)</u></p><p>“Huff! Huff! Huff! 
Huff!”</p><p><i>Just hang in there Rei! I’m almost there!</i></p><p><i>When I was in the 
battlefield, I suddenly felt this huge surge of power. At first, I didn’t know what to 
think. I thought it might’ve been Ares. But then, out of the blue, I felt it. </i>Haruka 
clenched her jaw. <i>Rei...Why did you go chasing after it alone?! We were supposed to 
rescue Minako together, remember?! What good does it do anyone if you—</i></p><p>In the 
woman’s vision she could see the Cupid Palace coming into view. But she was, once again, 
confronted by a small team of shadow assassins.</p><p>Haruka gritted her teeth, and raised 
her fist. “World…SHAKING!”</p><p><b>Wham! 
</b><i><b>Wrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiir---KABLAM!</b></i></p><p>“CRRAAAAA...!” Three more 
shadow assassins bit the dust.</p><p>Haruka leapt through the opening and ran straight into 
the palace courtyard. She came to a stop and warily eyed her surroundings.</p><p><i>This is 
it. This was where Rei’s signature disappeared. But... there’s something that doesn’t quite 
make any sense. There doesn’t look like there was a battle here.</i> She scanned the 
deserted grounds. Was she too late?</p><p><i>No! She’s got to be around here 
somewhere!</i></p><p>With that, the tall woman boosted her detection spell and began an area 
wide scan for the Martian’s signature. But Haruka wasn’t far into the search when her 
concentration was rudely interrupted when her watch communicator went off.</p><p>“Oh, for 
cryin’ out loud!” With an angry snarl she bashed the button and opened the channel. “...This 
had better be important!” she muttered underneath her breath.</p><p>She watched as Kali’s 
image appeared on screen. “Your Majesty.” Kali greeted her as if calling her superior in the 
middle of battle was the most natural thing in the world. If it were anyone else that she 
was speaking to, her calm stance may have fooled them but it was obvious to Haruka that the 
woman was agitated about something.</p><p>“Drop the act. What’s wrong?” Haruka said 
coolly.</p><p>“As you wish.” The woman closed her eyes, as if trying to block out the loud 
noise in the background. “It’s your shuttle, Haruka. I don’t know how to tell you this, 
but...it was destroyed.”</p><p><i>Ah!</i> Haruka felt her blood run cold. “What do you mean, 
by destroyed?”</p><p>“It means exactly that. From the report that I received from a nearby 
shuttle, they said that the shuttle suddenly exploded without any warning. As we speak, a 
search crew has gone to the wreckage to investigate and search for survivors... but from the 
sounds of it, I highly doubt that there were any. As for the cause of it...”</p><p>“Forget 
it.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I don’t care about that! Just tell me about Hotaru! You know she 
was in that shuttle! What happened to her?!”</p><p>Kali frowned at the stupid question. 
“Well, if she was in that shuttle when it exploded, then I would think that...” The woman 
suddenly turned her head around and was distracted by one of her subordinates.</p><p>“Think 
what?! Kali, don’t you dare ignore me!”</p><p>“Look, would you just shut up for a minute?!” 
She snapped back. She then listened to the rest of the soldier’s report, nodding in 
understanding, before she finally dismissed him.</p><p>“...What is it?” Haruka noticed that 
the third-ranked commander looked a little pale. “Did you guys find Hotaru?”</p><p>“Haruka.” 
Kali growled. Her green eyes were flashing. “Would you just give the kid a rest? If you were 
that worried about her safety, then you shouldn’t have brought her into a battlefield in the 
first place!”</p><p>Haruka opened her mouth to snap back, but on some level she knew her 
friend was right. As far as Kali knew, Hotaru was just an ordinary little girl that she had 
found on her travels. The ruler didn’t have the heart to tell the woman that their current 
dilemma and her comrade’s death were intimately tied into the girl’s existence. She didn’t 
know how Kali would take it. But now, she thought she may have an inkling of how the woman 
would react.</p><p><b>Ping! </b></p><p><i><b>Fizz…fizz…</b></i></p><p>Inside the Queen’s 
Chamber, Rei froze when she felt the malicious energy. Unconsciously she drew Minako a 
little closer.</p><p><i>What was that energy? </i>She hadn’t felt such a dark energy in 
years. <i>Something terrible is happening out 
there!</i></p><p><b>Ping!</b></p><p><b>FWOOOSH!</b></p><p>Outside, there was a loud 
explosion that rang throughout the air. Everyone on the field, including Haruka, braced 
themselves when they were hit by strong winds as a light filled the area.</p><p>Kali had 
tilted her head up and her eyes were widened in shock. “...Shit, Haruka.” On the shuttle’s 
overhead screen, it depicted a gigantic ball of pink-ish light hovering over the battlefield 
and in its center was Hotaru. “I think I just found her. If we live through this, we’re 
going to have a long talk!!”</p><p>Haruka turned her head towards the sky and gasped. 
“Hotaru?!”</p><p>Everyone else on the battlefield turned their heads towards the palace and 
gaped in awe. Ami and Makoto couldn’t believe what they were seeing.</p><p><i>Is that really 
Hotaru?</i> The two rulers gaped.</p><p>Michiru was already bolting down the battlefield to 
find Haruka. Meanwhile, the wind ruler found herself torn inside.</p><p>“Hotaru!”Haruka 
clenched her fists at her side. Hotaru was surrounded in purple flames--her eyes were 
narrowed and glowing pink. The woman didn’t want to acknowledge it, but looking at the sight 
before her it really did look as though her charge had transformed into a monster; Haruka 
could feel her entire body shake with fear. But she couldn’t run and hide now. In her mind, 
she could still see the first time she had met the girl: It had been extremely dark and her 
senses were reeling; when she first found the girl and saw her look up at her for the first 
time, she felt as though a light had come into her life.</p><p>“<i>Papa!”</i></p><p>As far 
as Haruka was concerned, Hotaru was still a shy, little girl who just wanted to be loved and 
protected. She had to protect her.</p><p><i>I have to do something! But 
what?!</i></p><p>“Hotaaaruuuu!” She called to her again. She hardly noticed Neptune reaching 
her side now.</p><p>“Haruka, look!” Michiru pointed out.</p><p>Haruka gasped. <i>Goddess! 
What’s happening to her?! </i>Before both women’s eyes, Hotaru’s body was beginning to 
change. She was growing taller, and her physique was developing into a young woman’s. She 
was aging before their very eyes!</p><p><b>RMM…RMM…RMM…</b></p><p>“Rrg!” Haruka tried to 
keep herself steady despite the shaking ground. <i>W-Where is she getting all of that 
power?! A-At this rate--!</i></p><p>Michiru was also struggling to keep her balance. <i>Her 
powers already rival ours! </i>She analyzed. The intelligent woman didn’t want to admit it, 
but if Hotaru’s powers kept growing at such exponential rate than they were all in 
trouble.</p><p>“Eh… Uwaah…” The sound of sobbing broke the air.</p><p><i>Is she crying? 
</i>Neptune and Uranus simultaneously thought.</p><p>Hot tears were pouring down Hotaru’s 
cheeks of her, now, teenage body. The emotional outburst affected Michiru the most; there 
was such an intense feeling of pain and anguish coming from the girl that Michiru came close 
to crying herself.</p><p><i>What is she reacting to? </i></p><p><b>Ping!</b></p><p>“Ah! Oh 
no!” She gasped at what she saw; a huge ball of light began to glow in one of Hotaru’s hands 
and it was growing at exponential proportions.</p><p>“HOTARU!” Haruka cried again. “Don’t do 
it!”</p><p>The dark orb kept on growing though. Soon, it had nearly become as big as the 
sphere that had initially surrounded the teenage girl. Everyone from the ground pointed up 
at the massive gathering of sparking energy. They all saw it for what it was: A threat to 
their survival.</p><p>“Hotaru!” Haruka tried to approach the girl, but a bolt of purple 
lightning shot towards her. She was nearly hit if it wasn’t for her partner, who pushed her 
out of the way just in the nick of time.</p><p><i><b>Kablam!</b></i></p><p>The two Goddesses 
glanced behind them to where Hotaru’s attack had hit. There was a huge crater in the 
rock.</p><p>Haruka was shocked. <i>If I had been hit by that...</i> “...Michiru. Isn’t there 
anything we can do?”</p><p>The shorter woman averted her gaze. “I don’t know. But I do know 
this... If she unleashes that thing, then everyone in the vicinity will be killed. Even the 
people in the city!”</p><p><i>Everyone...?</i></p><p>“No. You mean, there’s really nothing 
we can do? So then what?! We just have to sit around and let it 
happen?!”</p><p>“Haruka...”</p><p>“Damn it!!” The blonde stood up and turned to face the 
teenager. She raised her hands, noting how hard it shook.</p><p><i>I really don’t want to do 
this...!</i> She narrowed her green eyes as she summoned up her powers. There was no telling 
how much good it would do, but she had to try. <i>Please forgive me, 
Hotaru!</i></p><p>Michiru’s saw the gold colour spark around the woman’s arms. “What are you 
doing?!”</p><p><i><b>BAM!!!</b></i></p><p><b>RMM…RMM…RMM…</b></p><p>At that moment, another 
force interfered. In a blink of an eye, a darker energy attacked Hotaru. The girl tensed in 
surprise; the foreign energy swirled around the teenager’s body several of times before it 
shot upwards and hungry clamped down on the sphere of light. No one could believe their 
eyes-- the threat was being nullified by an invisible force.</p><p><i>It’s actually 
overpowering her aura! </i>The planet rulers realized.</p><p>Hotaru tried to lash out at the 
intruder, but she found that her powers were no match for them. The youth’s eyes narrowed 
when a voice rang out.</p><p>“<b>I see... so you have finally awakened.”</b></p><p>Michiru’s 
eyes widened upon hearing that voice. <i>That voice! </i><i>Could it 
be…?</i></p><p>“<b>Unfortunately… it is not yet time for your awakening …”</b></p><p>“Not 
time yet…?” Haruka mouthed. Recognition dawned on her. “Wait! I-It’s you! The Witch! What 
are you going to do to Hotaru?! Let her go!”</p><p>However, this invisible presence had 
other plans. With a silent command, the swirling void around Hotaru compressed down onto the 
girl and trapped her within its barrier. All the while, Hotaru was helpless. The girl 
attempted to struggle against the unseen opponent, only to feel her struggles weaken with 
her decreasing power. She was losing consciousness.</p><p>“Hotaru!” Through the patches of 
wind Haruka could barely make out Hotaru’s body slumping as an enormous blast of light lit 
the area. When the light disappeared, both Hotaru and the stranger had disappeared. “No...” 
<i>No, no, no, no! This can’t be happening</i>! “HOTARU!” Haruka raced to the spot beneath 
where she saw the girl disappear. “HOTAAARRUUU!”</p><p>“Haruka…” Michiru watched her partner 
slip into hysteria as she shouted the child’s name. As much as she wanted to cry herself, 
she tried to be strong for Haruka’s sake.</p><p>“Damn!” The blonde released a burst of power 
in frustration. She couldn’t accept this—to have Hotaru taken away by <i>that </i>person. 
“Michiru,” The other woman looked up at the mention of her name, “do you think you can 
figure out where she’s taken her?”</p><p>“Most likely... Why? What are you going to 
do?”</p><p>“I’m going to go find Rei and Minako. Once we’re all together, we’ll go after 
Hotaru. We have to get her back!”</p><p>Haruka ran off even before she saw Michiru nod in 
agreement. This time, when she faced the palace she could sense Rei’s 
signature.</p><p><i>There you are!</i></p><p><u>(Minako, Bed Chambers)</u></p><p>In one of 
the palace chambers, Minako finally stirred. The first thing the Venusian noticed was the 
sound of movement on her left side, and someone calling her name.</p><p>“My 
Lady!”</p><p>Minako slowly opened her eyes and realized that she was lying in a bed. She 
blinked and quizzically peered the room, somewhat feeling light-headed. She wasn’t dead was 
she? Her gaze finally came to rest on the individual who sat at her 
bedside.</p><p>“Taya...?”</p><p>“Oh, thank Goddess!” The next thing Minako knew, her advisor 
had bent down and embraced her into a secure hug. Past the woman’s head, she could make out 
a short-haired man in armor standing in the corner. She felt her heart skip a 
beat.</p><p>“Eros...?” The man averted his gaze. “But how...? I thought you 
were...”</p><p>“I’m sorry, my Lady... but... that isn’t Lord Eleutherios.” Taya said quietly 
and hugged her tighter.</p><p>“...Sapphro.” Minako said softly in understanding. She felt 
her friend release her from the hug, and instead held her steady by the shoulders. Minako 
looked down. “That’s right... It couldn’t be Eros, because...” She closed her eyes as it all 
came rushing back to her. It hurt so much.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Sapphro hung his head in 
shame. “I tried my best but... it turned out my best wasn’t good enough.”</p><p>His words 
resonated deeply within Minako. In response, she shook her head. “No. Please don’t blame 
yourself. I’m sure that you did everything you could. And if Eros were here, right now... 
I’m sure that he’d agree with me.”</p><p>“...I’m sorry.” Sapphro turned his head away to 
hide the beginnings of tears.</p><p>“Lady Minako...” Taya said gently. “You’ve been through 
a lot today, so... I think it would be for the best if we’d let you rest.”</p><p>“Wait. 
Taya...? Before you go, how did I get here? The last thing that I remember, I was in the 
Queen’s Chamber.”</p><p>The young woman saw her guardians both exchange looks.</p><p>“The 
Queen’s Chamber,” Taya said thoughtfully. She was interrupted when the three of them could 
hear people talking outside of the room. Sapphro immediately went to tell them to quiet 
down, but as soon as he opened the door, Minako exclaimed,</p><p>“You guys!” Everyone was 
there: Ami, Makoto, Haruka, Michiru and Rei had all stopped talking and looked at the 
shocked girl.</p><p>Minako almost felt like crying again.</p><p>“Hey! It’s good to see that 
you’re awake.” Haruka waved. She ignored Sapphro’s disapproving look and led the rest of the 
group in.</p><p>Minako was ecstatic. “I just can’t believe it! Am I seeing things? Like how? 
When...?”</p><p>“It’s a bit of a long story.” Ami admitted.</p><p>“Yeah, but the important 
thing is that we all got through in one piece.” Makoto laughed. But the awkward silence 
around her prompted the woman to shut up.</p><p>“Huh? Did something happen?” Minako blinked 
back curiously. She was surprised to see the apologetic looks she was receiving. 
“Umm...C-C’mon you guys, why the long expressions?”</p><p>“Hey... We all heard about what 
happened to your family. I think I speak for all of us when I say that we’re sorry for your 
loss.”</p><p>“Oh. I see... Well, you know, these things just happen sometimes, I guess...” 
She smiled.</p><p>“...Minako. I really hate to say this, but I’m afraid that we can’t stay 
for long. Something really important has come up.”</p><p>“What do you 
mean?”</p><p>“It’s...well, I’m sure we can handle it. But you stay here and rest, all right, 
kiddo? We’ll come back and visit you again soon.”</p><p>Haruka was surprised when the blonde 
suddenly looked glum. Had she said something wrong?</p><p>“I mean--”</p><p>“It’s okay. I 
understand...” Minako said in a quiet voice. If they thought she was going to be a burden if 
she came along, then she could understand being left behind. “If you guys don’t mind, I 
think I should rest. I guess I’m feeling tired after all...”</p><p>“...Yeah. All right 
then... we’ll let you get to it. I hope you feel better soon.”</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>Out of 
the corner of her eye, Minako watched the others leave one by one. But as they passed the 
door, her eyes couldn’t help but be drawn to the dark-haired woman there. Rei hadn’t moved 
from the doorway during the entire visit.</p><p>Taya saw the silent exchange between the two 
women. “Well, I suppose we should take our leave as well, my Lady. Please, rest 
well.”</p><p>The advisor got up and was met at the door by Sapphro. As the pair passed Rei, 
Sapphro paused long enough to whisper into her ear, “Your planet ruler killed my best 
friend. So if you ever make her cry, I’ll kill you myself.”</p><p>Rei said nothing and 
waited until the two had left. Once they were alone, the woman finally stepped into the room 
and closed the door behind her. For the longest time there was an awkward silence between 
them. Feeling somewhat nervous, Rei purposely walked up to the bed and sat down in the 
vacant chair. The creaking of the furniture relieved the silence only for a moment.</p><p>As 
Minako watched the woman sit in the chair, she suddenly noticed the extent of her friend’s 
injuries. There were a few nasty, black bruises on Rei’s face, and a long bandage wrapped 
about her forehead. On her arms, there were also quite a few of scrapes and 
bruises.</p><p>“Wow, just look at you. You’re all beaten up. What happened?”</p><p>The 
question shocked the Martian. “You mean... you don’t remember?”</p><p>“Remember 
what?”</p><p>Rei felt the hairs on her head starting to stick up at odd angles. <i>You 
really...don’t remember? You did this to me!!!</i> She wanted to shout, but somehow she 
found the will not to.</p><p>“It’s nothing.”</p><p>Sensing that it was a delicate topic, 
Minako finally said, “I see. So, umm, anyway... I guess you heard about what happened, 
right? It’s kinda crazy, huh?”</p><p>Rei closed her eyes for a moment. She could clearly see 
Minako’s weak smile when she was talking to Haruka only minutes before.</p><p>“What do you 
mean?”</p><p>“Huh? W-Well...everything I guess.”</p><p>Rei saw her smile again, but this 
wasn’t what she wanted. “Minako.” The hard tone that she said her name surprised the blonde. 
“...How do you really feel about all of 
this?”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“Honestly.”</p><p>“...Honestly?” Minako finally dropped the smile. 
“I don’t know. It’s just... It happened so fast.”</p><p><i>Those men...</i> Minako thought 
back to the three who had went with her into the Audience Chamber.</p><p>“I thought I had 
everything under control...”</p><p><i>Marie... Eros...Mother... Oh no. I’m going to 
cry!</i></p><p>“I was so sure of myself that I could save everyone. But...look what’s 
happened. They’re dead. They’re all dead because I wasn’t strong enough to save 
them!”</p><p>Rei was speechless as she watched the tears begin to spill down Minako’s face. 
The loss of a family; it reminded her of living alone on Mars.</p><p>“I-I thought they 
abandoned me... but they were...” Minako bit her bottom lip. “They were just trying to save 
me!”</p><p><i>They still loved me... even after I’ve failed them.</i></p><p>She couldn’t 
help it. She couldn’t stop crying, even with Rei sitting right there. “Hah... You probably 
think... I’m such a big baby, crying like this, right?”</p><p>She froze when she felt a 
gentle hand on her shoulder. Minako lifted her chin up and saw Rei staring straight into her 
eyes. There was such a serious expression on her face.</p><p>“No. You aren’t being a 
baby.”</p><p>She didn’t know why, but after hearing those simple words the tears wouldn’t 
stop. She cried harder than before, this time into Rei’s shoulder as the woman held her in a 
secure embrace.</p><p>They both stayed like that for awhile.</p>
