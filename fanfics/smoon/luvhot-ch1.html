<h1>I Love You Hotaru</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/amazonessduo.html">Amazoness Quartet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>
ChibiUsa and Hotaru are both 16 and live in Crystal Tokyo.  None of our 
fanfics take place in the same time frame.  Kinda like an alternate dimension 
for each fic. We may revisit these things by doing sequels to stories.  So, don&#39;t 
worry, we&#39;ll tell you if any two stories are connected.  This is our second
fanfic and we love feedback so please e-mail us. We love to hear from people 
and what they thought of our stories or what stories they&#39;d like us to write.  
Thanks. ^_^

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	ChibiUsa was walking around the museum.  She was looking at 20th 
century artifacts.  She had been living back in the 20th century a couple
years ago.  In fact, that was where she had met Hotaru.  As she thought of
Hotaru she realized that the other girl was late.  Hotaru was supposed to have
met her half an hour ago. &#39;Where is she,&quot; thought ChibiUsa.
	&quot;Odango-chan!  There you are, Odango-chan,&quot; Hotaru ran up, catching
her breath.  ChibiUsa was embarrassed as Hotaru caught up to her.  Hotaru had
come up with that pet name for her a little while ago, but had never called
her by it in a large public place.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, ChibiUsa.  There aren&#39;t a 
lot of people here, and even if there were, it wouldn&#39;t matter.  I want 
everyone to know that I love you.&quot;
	ChibiUsa blushed as Hotaru said that.  She loved Hotaru, too. She
just didn&#39;t want everyone to know Hotaru&#39;s name for her.  It had been hard 
enough telling her parents and the other senshi that she had finally found
her true love and that it was Hotaru.  She would wind up telling the general
populace later on in a speech or something if Hotaru didn&#39;t tell the rest of
the planet first.
	&quot;Weren&#39;t you supposed to be here half an hour ago?&quot; ChibiUsa asked.
	&quot;Nope.  You were late. I&#39;ve been looking everywhere for you,&quot; Hotaru
said. &quot;I think your watch is broken.&quot; Hotaru pointed at ChibiUsa&#39;s watch.
	ChibiUsa looked at her watch, and, Hotaru was right.
	&quot;But, maybe you can make up for being late later,&quot; Hotaru said as she
smiled innocently.
	ChibiUsa slid her arm around Hotaru&#39;s waist.  &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking a 
lot lately.  If I hadn&#39;t gone back to the past, I never would have met you,
Hotaru,&quot; said ChibiUsa feeling a tear run down her face as she thought of 
never meeting Hotaru.  &quot;And then we would never have been best friends, or 
have realized how deep our feelings were for each other, or....&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s okay, Odango-Chan,&quot; said Hotaru as she embraced her girlfriend.
&quot;All that matters is that we did meet and that we did realize those feelings.
Don&#39;t cry, ChibiUsa.&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m okay now.  I just realized how lucky I am to have you,&quot; she told
Hotaru through misty eyes.  Another tear ran down her face as she looked at 
Hotaru.  A tear of joy for having Hotaru.  Hotaru held her closer.
	&quot;Good. Now maybe we can start looking around the museum.&quot; Hotaru said
as she pinched ChibiUsa&#39;s ass.
	&quot;Owwww, that hurts, Hotaru,&quot; ChibiUsa complained.
	&quot;Well, I would kiss it, but I don&#39;t think you want to do that in the
museum right here and now,&quot; Hotaru smiled.
	All ChibiUsa could do was blush.
	&quot;Or do you?&quot; Hotaru asked innocently &quot;You are the princess of Crystal
Tokyo. No one could get you in any real trouble.&quot;
	&quot;I don&#39;t see Neo Queen Serenity taking it well when she hears that her
daughter was making love to her girlfriend in a public museum.&quot; said ChibiUsa.
	&quot;You should be more adventuresome.  There&#39;s always the thrill that
we might get caught, Odango-chan,&quot; said Hotaru as she drew ChibiUsa closer to
her.	
	&quot;You just want the rest of the planet to find out by seeing the two
of us, don&#39;t you?&quot;  ChibiUsa lightly put her hand on Hotaru&#39;s face.  She 
lightly traced Hotaru&#39;s luscious lips with her forefinger.  She trailed her
finger down to Hotaru&#39;s chin and leaned towards her.  The two girls met
in a passionate kiss that left the rest of the world far from their minds.
The two finally pulled away after what seemed like hours.  ChibiUsa looked
at her best friend, her girlfriend, her lover, her soul mate.  Hotaru&#39;s 
face was so beautiful.  Her body had grown very well since they had been 
children, and ChibiUsa loved every inch of it.  She was the most precious 
thing to ChibiUsa.
	&quot;Of course, ChibiUsa. I love you and I want the world to know,&quot; 
Hotaru told her as they broke the kiss, &quot;If I love you so much, and you love
me, why shouldn&#39;t everyone know?&quot;
	&quot;I love you too, Hotaru.  Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll tell everyone soon enough.
I just don&#39;t know exactly how,&quot; said ChibiUsa.
	Setsuna spotted the two girls talking as they headed through the 
museum.  She smiled as she saw them kissing.  She had been ChibiUsa&#39;s friend
for a long time and she had helped raise Hotaru, so she was happy for both of
them.  The older girl walked over to the younger couple.
	&quot;So there you two are.  You&#39;re late for the banquet.  I was on my way 
there and decided to look for you,&quot; Setsuna said.
	&quot;Oh, Setsuna nice to see you. Hotaru and I were just looking at the 
lovely artifacts here,&quot; said ChibiUsa, startled that Setsuna had walked up as
she and Hotaru had been kissing.  She had told Setsuna along with the rest of
the senshi, but she was still nervous.  She had never been so close
to anyone as she was with Hotaru, and it felt awkward when her other friends 
were around.
	&quot;Yeah, right.  Well, c&#39;mon you two lovebirds, or we&#39;ll miss the whole
banquet,&quot; Setsuna turned and started to lead the way back to the palace.
	Hotaru looked at ChibiUsa slightly annoyed.  &quot;Don&#39;t be so shy all of 
of the time, ChibiUsa.  If you&#39;re worried about little things like Setsuna
seeing us kiss, what will you do about big things like when you announce our
wedding?&quot; 
	&quot;W..W...Wedding?&quot; asked ChibiUsa.  She was having a hard enough time 
thinking about telling the rest of the world about the two of them and trying
not to be nervous around her friends to worry about marriage right now.
	&quot;We ARE getting married, right??&quot; asked Hotaru, pissed off at ChibiUsa
for not even thinking about it.  She wanted to have a nice, big wedding with 
all of their friends and families there.  She loved ChibiUsa and wanted to 
marry her.  
	&quot;Don&#39;t we have a banquet to go to Hotaru?&quot; said ChibiUsa changing the
subject as they followed Setsuna.
	Setsuna smiled to herself as the two talked.  They&#39;d get married
pretty soon.  She had seen it in the future.  She knew she shouldn&#39;t check
into the future, but sometimes things got so interesting, like with Hotaru
and ChibiUsa, that she couldn&#39;t help herself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	ChibiUsa and Hotaru arrived at the banquet hand in hand.  Neo Queen
Serenity had organized the banquet so she could get all her friends together.
She saw them all often, but getting them all in the same place was all but
impossible if it wasn&#39;t preplanned, so she had these banquets from time to 
time.
	&quot;ChibiUsa!! Oh good, I thought something might have happened to you,&quot;
said Neo Queen Serenity as she approached her daughter.
	&quot;It&#39;s okay, mom. Hotaru and I just lost track of time, I guess,&quot; said
ChibiUsa.
	&quot;Ohhhh. Okay.&quot; Serenity winked at ChibiUsa thinking she understood
what took them so long.
	ChibiUsa blushed as she realized what Serenity thought happened.  She
and Hotaru had made love before on a lot of occasions and Serenity had never
guessed, but now she thought that something had happened and they hadn&#39;t even 
done anything.  &quot;No, wait, you don&#39;t understand.  We were at the mmm.....&quot; 
she was stopped as she felt Hotaru&#39;s lips pressed against her own.  By the 
time Hotaru finally pulled away Serenity was already mingling with her 
friends.  &quot;Why did you do that, Hotaru-chan?&quot; asked ChibiUsa.
	&quot;Because you look soooo cute when you&#39;re embarrassed,&quot; stated Hotaru.  
ChibiUsa blushed further as she said that.  She wrapped her arm around 
ChibiUsa and pulled the other girl closer to her.  ChibiUsa leaned her head 
on Hotaru&#39;s shoulder.  No matter what happened during the day, it all melted 
away when she was in Hotaru&#39;s arms.  Hotaru held her gently as she looked at 
the people who had come.  All of the senshi were here, including the Sailor
Quartet, the Starlights, and Princess Kakyuu.
	&quot;Wow, mom really got everybody here, didn&#39;t she?&quot; ChibiUsa was amazed 
that everyone had been able to go to the banquet.
	&quot;Yeah, there sure are a lot of people.  It would be pretty easy for 
someone with a beautiful girlfriend to sneak off for a few minutes. Or hours.&quot;
	ChibiUsa liked this idea already.  &quot;And where did you have in mind?&quot;
	&quot;Oh, its not far, Odango-chan.  This way,&quot; Hotaru took ChibiUsa&#39;s 
hand.  ChibiUsa giggled as she followed Hotaru out of the room.  Hotaru 
stopped outside an empty room.  &quot;Here we are,&quot; said Hotaru as she and ChibiUsa
entered the room.
	&quot;But... Hotaru, this is too close to the banquet.  What if someone 
catches us?&quot; asked ChibiUsa nervously.  Every other time they had sex there
had been little danger of being caught except for one time before she told
her parents and before Hotaru had moved in with her.  Hotaru had fallen asleep
in ChibiUsa&#39;s room.  ChibiUsa had to get up and go to breakfast soon.  But 
Hotaru had insisted she stay, and how could she say no to Hotaru sitting 
naked on her bed.  As they started to make love, Serenity had knocked on the 
door and told ChibiUsa it was time for breakfast.  She almost went in 
ChibiUsa&#39;s room but finally ChibiUsa told her that she&#39;d skip breakfast.  That
time had been close, and she didn&#39;t want to get caught during a banquet by any
one, especially when all the senshi were there.
	&quot;Like I said before, there&#39;s always the thrill that we might get 
caught.  And besides, I don&#39;t want to wait until the banquet&#39;s over, and it 
will take to long to go all the way back to our room,&quot; pointed out Hotaru.
	&quot;That&#39;s true.&quot; ChibiUsa admitted. She didn&#39;t like where this
was going.
	&quot;Do you want to wait till we get to your room? That could ruin the
mood.&quot; 	Hotaru said as she started pulling ChibiUsa&#39;s dress off.
	&quot;I guess your right,&quot; ChibiUsa finally gave in. She then pulled away
from Hotaru so she could close the door. After she closed the door and turned
around and saw Hotaru standing there wearing her bra, panties, and socks.
	ChibiUsa started taking off her outfit but Hotaru stopped her.
	&quot;Here, let me.&quot; Hotaru told ChibiUsa.
	&quot;Okay.&quot; ChibiUsa complied, slightly confused as to what Hotaru had
in mind.
	Hotaru started gently squeezing ChibiUsa&#39;s breasts through the
soft cloth of the dress. Slowly, she pulled the dress down to her waist.  She
slid her hands behind ChibiUsa. Her hands slid up ChibiUsa&#39;s back. She 
unclasped the bra and dropped it on the floor.
	Hotaru looked  at ChibiUsa&#39;s perfectly round and palm-sized breasts.
She moved her head right in front of one of ChibiUsa&#39;s breasts. She took 
the nipple into her mouth and started gently sucking on it. With her other
hand, she ever so slowly started pinching and twisting ChibiUsa&#39;s 
other nipple. ChibiUsa moaned as she felt Hotaru&#39;s tongue wash over her 
pebble-like nipple.  Hotaru&#39;s other hand slid down to ChibiUsa&#39;s waist. She 
pushed the dress down the rest of the way and let it fall to ground leaving
ChibiUsa only in her panties and socks.  Hotaru slowly placed her hand in 
ChibiUsa&#39;s panties.  Feeling that ChibiUsa was wet, she pulled her hand out
and stopped sucking on ChibiUsa&#39;s breast.  ChibiUsa let out a small whimper as
soon as Hotaru stopped.  Hotaru bent down and started pulling ChibiUsa&#39;s
panties down.  After ChibiUsa stepped out of them, Hotaru started leaning
closer to ChibiUsa&#39;s pussy.  As she got closer, she could smell ChibiUsa&#39;s
musky scent.  She licked ChibiUsa&#39;s pussy slowly, savoring the taste of her
love juices.  Her hand went up the back of ChibiUsa&#39;s leg.  She ran her hand
over ChibiUsa&#39;s firm ass.  ChibiUsa got down on her knees so she was face to
face with Hotaru.  Hotaru&#39;s face was wet with ChibiUsa&#39;s love juices. 
ChibiUsa leaned forward and kissed Hotaru, tasting herself in Hotaru&#39;s mouth.
As they kissed, ChibiUsa slid off Hotaru&#39;s bra and panties.  She ran her 
hand down the side of Hotaru&#39;s legs and pulled her socks off, leaving both
girls sitting together naked on the floor.  Hotaru ran her hand through 
ChibiUsa&#39;s beautiful pink hair.  ChibiUsa&#39;s hands cupped Hotaru&#39;s soft 
breasts.  She rubbed circles around her nipples causing them to harden 
further.  Hotaru grasped one of ChibiUsa&#39;s breasts and started pinching and 
twisting the nipple.  Her other hand went past ChibiUsa&#39;s smooth stomach 
towards her pussy.  ChibiUsa felt the heat between her legs rise as she felt
one of Hotaru&#39;s fingers pressed up against her slit.  Hotaru loved the feeling
she was getting from her breasts but she needed something more.  She grabbed 
ChibiUsa&#39;s hand and lowered it to her own pussy, rubbing ChibiUsa&#39;s fingers 
against her womanhood.  ChibiUsa gasped as she felt two of Hotaru&#39;s fingers
push into her pussy, pumping in and out.  She continued to pinch and twist
one of Hotaru&#39;s nipples as her own fingers started rubbing Hotaru&#39;s pussy.  
She felt Hotaru&#39;s love juices over her hand now as she and Hotaru started 
panting.  Hotaru saw ChibiUsa&#39;s love juice flowing down her inner thighs and 
slowly dripping on the floor.  Hotaru felt ChibiUsa&#39;s fingers probing in 
her cunt.  She could barely take it anymore she slid another finger into 
ChibiUsa and heard her moan.  Both girls leaned forward into a passionate kiss
as they reached orgasm.  
	Hotaru pulled her fingers out of ChibiUsa and licked away her cum.  
ChibiUsa moved her head between Hotaru&#39;s legs and lapped away the Hotaru&#39;s cum.
&quot;See, Odango-chan.  That was worth it, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; Hotaru asked as ChibiUsa
snuggled up to her on the floor.
	ChibiUsa just nodded. 
	&quot;I love you, Hotaru.&quot; ChibiUsa murmured as she and Hotaru fell asleep
holding each other.
	They were both asleep by the time the door opened.  Vesta was shocked
as she saw the two sleeping, naked girls on the floor.  She had an evil grin
when she started to step into the room, but Ceres and Junos pulled her out of 
the room.
	&quot;C&#39;mon you two, let me go! I want to go back in there!&quot; argued Vesta.
	&quot;No way. Didn&#39;t you see how happy they are in each others arms?  Its
sweet and you&#39;d ruin that,&quot; said Ceres.
	&quot;Romantic relationships are between two people Vesta. I don&#39;t think
they&#39;d want anyone intruding into their relationship,&quot; said Junos.
	&quot;Yeah, but I&#39;d just be in it for the sex, anyway. It has nothing to
do with their relationship. And their both asleep. As it is, they&#39;ve just had
sex with each other.  Think about if we join in. Let&#39;s go back in there,&quot; said
Vesta trying to reason with the other two girls.
	Both girls looked at her and smacked her upside the head.  &quot;You&#39;re 
completely missing the point of a romantic relationship, Vesta. It&#39;s when the
only thing that matters to you is the other person,&quot; said Junos.
	&quot;Yeah. So leave Hotaru and ChibiUsa alone. Now lets go find another 
empty room,&quot; said Ceres.
	Vesta put her arms around Ceres&#39; and Junos&#39; waists.  &quot;Well, at least
I&#39;ve got you two and Pallas.&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Well, we hope you liked the story.  We wanted to keep the plot that 
the Sailor Quartet are all more than friends going in this, but we hope it 
didn&#39;t affect the rest of the story too much.  We wanted to keep most of the 
story romantic and centering on the relationship between Hotaru and ChibiUsa.
They&#39;re a great couple and we&#39;ll almost certainly use them again in a hentai
story.  Anyway, we&#39;re still open for story ideas as long as it has lesser 
used characters that you have interesting ideas for.  So please send them in.
Oh well, thank you for taking the time to read this and hopefully there will
be more from us soon. :)
