<h1>Wild Fire, Crystal Ice (part 4 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/wfci-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Hotaru winced as Setsuna made a sharp turn with the car. 
&quot;Um...Setsuna-mama...aren&#39;t we driving a bit...fast?&quot; Setsuna sped up, 
and kept her eyes on the road. &quot;Yes...but we have to hurry, or else Rei 
and her little...group will escape with that girl. And all our hard work 
will be in vain.&quot; Hotaru shut her eyes tightly, and gripped her 
seatbelt. &quot;Very well, Setsuna-mama...&quot;

=============

Rei was panicking.

This was bad, considering she rarely panicked.

&quot;Hide Minako! And Serenity too! Dammit! Minako, you idiot, this is your 
fault, you know?&quot;

The rest of the group clamored around, trying to find an appropriate 
hiding place for the two girls. &quot;Um..Rei,&quot; Ami stated calmly, &quot; I don&#39;t 
think there is a good place to hide two women in here. And Hotaru has 
sharp eyes,&quot; she added, feeling a chill go up her spine at the thought 
of Hotaru&#39;s cold, calculating violet eyes. Rei frowned. &quot;Well...find 
someplace to hide them! There has to be somewhere...&quot; Ami&#39;s eyes 
suddenly brightened. &quot;I know where! The big storage room! You know, the 
one that had all of the expensive stuff in it that you um...sold.&quot; Rei 
grinned. &quot;Oh yeah!&quot; Minako pouted. &quot;But it&#39;s...dusty in there. I have 
allergies.&quot; Rei frowned. &quot;No you don&#39;t! And do you just WANT to die?!&quot; 
She grabbed Minako by the collar and threw her in the storage room. &quot;Now 
stay there!&quot; A pain-filled whimper came from Minako, and the others 
sweatdropped. Rei turned to Serenity and Mitsuki, and did a mock bow. 
&quot;Um..you two princesses might want to hide in there too. It&#39;ll look 
weird if you&#39;re here and Minako isn&#39;t, Mitsuki.&quot; Mitsuki nodded, and 
walked into the room, Serenity following behind her

Rei wasn&#39;t the least bit surprised when she heard Setsuna gently tap on 
the front door a few minutes later...

============

Setsuna smiled at Rei, Ami, and Makoto when she walked through the front 
door, Hotaru following behind her. Setsuna turned to Rei. &quot;I...apologize 
for doing this. But...I have a job to do, you see. Now...where is the 
girl?&quot; Rei frowned. &quot;She isn&#39;t here. Neither are Minako and Mitsuki. 
They..um..left. I think they were worried about being caught.&quot; Setsuna 
raised an eyebrow. &quot;I....see. Hmm...well, you don&#39;t mind if I look 
around, do you?&quot; Rei smiled and stepped back. &quot;Not at all.&quot;

And the search began.

===========

Perhaps Minako was not allergic to dust, but Mitsuki was. She sniffled, 
and Minako punched her in the arm. &quot;Hush!&quot; she whispered, her eyes 
darting back and forth nervously. Mitsuki winced. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t hit 
girls,&quot; she whispered back, holding her arm. Serenity tried not to 
laugh, as they whispered (loudly) back and forth. Then, suddenly, they 
both grew still. They looked to Serenity, and Mitsuki raised her index 
finger to her lips to indicate that she should be quiet. Serenity 
nodded. Hotaru&#39;s soft voice echoed throughout the storage room moments 
later. &quot;We haven&#39;t looked here yet, Setsuna-mama,&quot; she said, walking 
around the room. Setsuna walked in, and Serenity heard both Mitsuki and 
Minako suck in their breath. They both walked around the room, searching 
around the empty boxes carefully. 

When they arrived where the three girls were hiding, Mitsuki grabbed the 
cross around her neck so tightly, her knuckles turned white. Hotaru 
looked around the area, and then she sighed. &quot;Rei-chan was right, 
Setsuna-mama...they aren&#39;t here.&quot; Setsuna frowned. &quot;Very well..let&#39;s 
go.&quot;

Hotaru waited until Setsuna left the room, then knelt down very close to 
the boxes and whispered,

&quot;Hurry up...run, and get her someplace safe. I wouldn&#39;t want to marry 
Endymion-baka either.&quot;

She walked out, and all three women sighed in unison.

&quot;That was reeeeaaaly close,&quot; Minako muttered...

===========

Endymion slammed his fist on his oak desk in frustration. He shook his 
head, and glared at Drake Loned, who cringed. &quot;Setsuna and Hotaru can&#39;t 
find her. The POLICE can&#39;t find her. Where can she be?&quot; Drake frowned. 
&quot;I have no idea...but I do hope my daughter is safe.&quot; Endymion smiled 
icily.

&quot;Yes..of course...&quot;

Rei paced back and forth while the others sat down, staring at her. &quot;We 
have to leave,&quot; Minako stated quietly, lacing her fingers with Mitsuki&#39;s 
own. &quot;Where though?&quot; Makoto asked. &quot;We have to leave this solar 
system..period,&quot; Rei muttered. Mitsuki let go of Minako&#39;s hand, and 
frowned. &quot; I know where we can go..&quot;

&quot;...We can go to Ni...my home...&quot;
