<h1>Long Lost Love Returned (part 1 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/crystalrose.html">Crystal Rose Winter</a><br> </h2>
<pre>    It was a beautiful day when Crystal and the girls went to the park 
to have a picnic. Every thing was going just fine until dark clouds 
came in. &#145;That is weird the clouds seem to only be around the park. I 
wonder what is going on?&#146; Crystal thought to herself. 

    As she was turning around to get every thing ready to go because 
it looked like it was going to rain, she saw her friends walk off just 
after she heard a scream come from, The way they were going she left 
the area that the food, was in to catch up to them when she realized 
that they started running. &quot;Hey wait up you guys you know I can&#146;t run 
that fast.&quot; Crystal yelled, as she started running she could see that 
the girls were picking up the pace. 

     They then ran behind a bush out of her site to become the Sailor 
Scouts. Even though Crystal was so far behind, She could hear clearly 
the voices of her friends yell out. 


    &quot;URANUS PLANET POWER!&quot; Amara yelled, as she was bathed in, a dark 
navy blue light and feathers, as she became Sailor Uranus. &quot;NEPTUNE 
PLANET POWER!&quot; Shouted Michelle, as she was bathed in an ocean aqua 
green light and feathers, as she became Sailor Neptune. &quot;SATURN PLANET 
POWER!&quot; Screamed Hotaru, as she was bathed in dark purple light and 
feathers, as she became Sailor Saturn. &quot;PLUTO PLANET POWER!&quot; Trista 
cried, as she was bathed in black light and feathers, as she became 
Sailor Pluto. 

    &quot;MARS CRYSTAL POWER!&quot; Screamed Raye, as she was bathed in a fire 
red light and feathers, as she becomes Sailor Mars. &quot;MERCURY CRYSTAL 
POWER!&quot; Said Amy, as she was bathed in a royally blue light and 
feathers, as she became Sailor Mercury. &quot;JUPITER CRYSTAL POWER!&quot; 
Yelled Lita, as she was bathed in a forest green light and feathers, 
as she became Sailor Jupiter. 
&quot;VENUS CRYSTAL POWER!&quot; cried Mina, as she was bathed in a 
yellowish/orange light and feathers, as she became Sailor Venus. 

    &quot;MOON COSMOS POWER!&quot; Serena shouted, and just like the rest Serena 
was bathed in silver and white light and feathers, 
And she too became not Sailor Moon but Sailor Cosmos. 

    What Crystal saw shocked her to the core.  In front of her, nine 
of her best friends where covered from head to toe in the light. And 
these lights were so bright that Crystal had to look away. However, 
before she could run up to them she blacked out. In addition, the last 
thing she saw was Sailor Cosmos turn to her with worry written in her 
bluish/silver eyes.

Crystal A.k.A Sailor Ice P.O.V.

    So that I could take over, When Crystal blacked out I knew and 
deep down Serenity knew that it was almost time for the truth to come 
out,
    
    Hello I am Sailor Ice and Crystal Rose Winter. Now I know what 
you&#146;re thinking why doesn&#146;t Crystal just transform into Sailor Ice. 
Well you know how at first Darien didn&#146;t know that he was Tuxedo Mask, 
well Crystal doesn&#146;t know that we meaning Crystal and myself are one, 
and the same. 

    And unlike my other half I have all of my memories from the Silver 
Millennium, You see I was the leader of the Outer Sailor Scouts back 
then and I also was and, still am for that matter the second strongest 
Sailor Scout. I also held the second most feared weapon. That is, was, 
and always will be the Ice Heart of Iceland.

    I guess I should get back to what I was saying. Being that I am 
Sailor Ice I am able to run as fast as I need to unlike, Crystal. 


    But when she and I come together as one she will be able to do all 
the things I can do. Anyway, I keep going off subject here. When I get 
to the battle, I can see Sailor Mercury, Neptune and Pluto down and 
out. 
With Sailor Cosmos, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, Uranus, and Saturn just 
barely were hanging on. And Tuxedo Mask was hiding in the shadows (AN 
like the Coward he is. Sorry I do not Like that Man.)

    I turn back to the battle just in time to see Sailor Cosmos,
Taking a hit that from the looks of it was meant to take out Uranus. 
Anyway just as Sailor Cosmos was going down Uranus caught her. I was 
just about to let them know that they had back up when Sailor Mars 
started yelling &quot;MARS FLAME SNIPER!&quot; Seeing and hearing this made me 
shake my head while yelling my own attack

    &quot;ICE BOMB FFFFFFFFRRRRREEEEEEZZZZEEEE!&quot; I yelled the last word at 
the top of my lungs. The monster was down. Now all the Sailors had to 
do was finish it. Seeing their chance they started to power up, I 
could tell that they would need my help so I yelled out after I heard 
them yell &quot;ICE PLANET POWER!&quot; All as one we yelled &quot;SAILOR PLANET 
ATTACK!&quot; When the monster was gone cape boy um, I mean Tuxedo Mask 
came out. Uranus was over by Sailor Cosmos seeing if she was ok.
    
    Sailor Mars and I saw that Tuxedo Mask was trying to get to the 
Princess. However, before I could stop him Mars had beat me to it as I 
hear her yell, &quot;MARS FLAME SNIPER!&quot; Everyone was surprised that Mars 
did that. However, I knew what was going on in her mind. In addition, 
I fully agreed with her knowing that he is not who most think him to 
be.

    You see most people think he is the Princess&#146;s soul mate.
Well I am here to tell you that he is far from her soul mate or love 
from the Silver Millennium. See I know because I was there.

FLASHBACK

    I was walking in the gardens when. I saw something that made me 
smile the Princess was walking hand in hand with the Princess of 
Uranus, Amara. Though everyone just thought they where just close 
friends I saw what was real and that would be love. I once told them 
that I knew what they where to each other, And they thought that I 
would go to the Queen with what I knew, but I cut that fear off at the 
pass. 

    By telling them that I would not say word one to the Queen unless 
they told me I could. I was walking up to them to say hi, when from 
out of the corner of my eye, I saw something that I wish I had not for 
I saw a mad Earth Prince making his way towards the two.


    When he got to them he grabbed Serenity and yanked her to him. 
Seeing that not only set me off but it also set Uranus off, And if 
there is one thing I have learned over the years it is not to PISS her 
off. In addition, looking at her I knew right away that she was indeed 
pissed. Acting fast, I yelled, &quot;NO STOP URANUS HE IS NOT WORTH IT. 
Prince Endyimon if you want to live I would let the Princess go.&quot; 

    The reply I got made me just as mad as Uranus. &quot;Why should I 
listen to you little girl. Serenity is, was and always will be mine. 
And I know just how to show her that she can not and will not get away 
from me.&quot; When I heard this my eyes widened when I realized what he 
meant and started dragging her away.

Normal P.O.V.

      Endyimon just kept dragging Serenity away until they got to a 
bedroom. Endyimon through her on the floor falling on top of her so 
she couldn&#146;t move. When she tried screaming for help but he would 
cover her lips with his. 

    Luckily Sailor Ice and Sailor Uranus, where just passing the room 
with about eighteen guards and the other Sailor Scouts. When they 
heard the start of a scream. Sailor Ice turned to Uranus and nodded to 
her saying in a whisper. &quot;Ok we know where they are, send two guards 
to get the Queen and let&#146;s go. Now the rest of you stay here while the 
Scouts, and the two of us go in and stop him from whatever he is 
doing. Mercury, Saturn, and Neptune, I want you to be ready to get 
Serenity to the med bay, while Mars, Jupiter, Venus, Uranus, and I 
take care of the Prince.&quot; Once they all agreed they headed in just to 
hear a scream and a resounding slap. Followed closely by &quot;I told you 
to shut up.&quot; 

    When that was said the prince just happened to look up as well. 
When he saw all of the Sailor Scouts looking like they would kill him 
right on, the spot he wisely got up off, of the Princess who by that 
time was trembling in fear. Uranus went up to her and started 
whispering in her ear. &quot;Shh, It&#146;s ok he&#146;s not going to hurt you he 
will Never hurt you again.&quot; 

    As she was saying this, Queen Serenity came in and saw what was 
happening. To say that she was disgusted would be putting it mildly; 
Sailor Ice began telling what had happened. 

    &quot;You see Your Majesty I knew about Sailor Uranus and the Princess 
for a long time, I however didn&#146;t tell you because they where afraid 
that you would not agree and let them continue with what they have. So 
I promised that I wouldn&#146;t tell unless they said it was ok or if the 
Princess or Amara where in danger because of it.&quot; When Sailor Ice was 
done talking the Queen turned to Amara and said.

    &quot;Why did you hid this from me I would have been happy with it as 
long as my daughter was&quot;. Not knowing what to say Amara said the only 
thing she could say, &quot;I was scared that you would take Serenity away 
from me&quot;. By then all of the Sailors were in the med bay with Serenity 
Queen Serenity and Endyimon was in jail for attempted rape, And 
Mercury was tending to the Princess when Serenity woke up, &quot;AMARA.&quot;

END FLASHBACK Crystal&#146;s P.O.V.

    Pulling out of my memories, I realized that Sailor Cosmos had 
yelled out at the same time as the Princess in my memories. When I 
looked up, I saw Sailor Uranus&#146;s World Shaking attack coming right at 
me; and Sailor Cosmos was running to take the hit for me. When she got 
to me, I had just a few seconds to push myself, and Sailor Cosmos out 
of the way of the deadly attack. Yelling &quot;SAILOR COSMOS LOOK OUT.&quot; I 
pushed her to the floor covering her with my own body and putting up 
an Ice shield. 

    When the dust settled down so that I could see, Sailor Cosmos and 
I looked up. Sailor Cosmos looked up and yelled &quot;Uranus what do you 
think your doing attacking someone like that. You should be shamed of 
yourself. I can&#146;t believe that you just attacked someone like that. If 
she where the enemy then It would be ok to attack but she is NOT. 
Because, she just helped the Sailors get rid of that monster. Now she 
may not help US at all.&quot; 

    Through all of this I was looking at her in amusement in a calm 
voice I said &quot;It&#146;s ok she wouldn&#146;t have been able to get through my 
Ice Shield.&quot; </pre>
