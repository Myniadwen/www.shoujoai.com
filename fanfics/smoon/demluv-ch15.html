<a href="../smoon/demluv-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>A NEW HOME

  Usagi resumed school a few days later, when 
her prescription ran out and her bowels returned 
to normal. Rei had gone back to the jinja to 
make Yuuichiro&#39;s old room ready for Usagi&#39;s 
arrival. She was psyched.
  Kenji and Ikuko had agreed reluctantly to let 
Usagi move to the jinja. But, it was closer to 
the University, and the route didn&#39;t have as 
much traffic. Usagi&#39;s car was all wheel drive, 
safe, and paid for. They would need it in the 
winter. 
  Of course, Rei had gotten around for years on 
a bike and a pair of skis, and insisted she 
didn&#39;t need a car. But that was pre-portable 
piano.
  Ikuko was assured that she wouldn&#39;t have to 
worry about the &#39;food thing&#39;. Rei promised to 
take cooking lessons from Makoto, and proper 
&#39;Usagi&#39; nutrition instructions from Ikuko. 
  Another week went by until Usagi&#39;s strength 
and shortness of breath improved sufficiently 
enough to make the move.
  Grandpa had gone on his three weeklong fall 
pilgrimage and wouldn&#39;t be back for another 2 
days. Rei urged the senshi and the Tsukino&#39;s to 
help Usagi move in then, so Grandpa wouldn&#39;t try
to help and hurt himself. 
  Mr. Tsukino and Mamoru handled the cabinetry 
and actually got along quite well. Something 
about... the &#39;postponement of any commitments 
until Usagi had a college degree&#39;, had appealed 
to Kenji. He had noticed the absence of Mamoru&#39;s 
ring on his daughter&#39;s hand. Mamoru smiled and 
felt good inside for the first time in weeks.
  When everything was moved, a huge picnic was 
held on the jinja grounds, since it was closed 
to the public due to the pilgrimage. Rei was 
grateful that Grandpa had let her stay at the 
Tsukino&#39;s and miss part of her training. Rei was 
certain Usagi was alive because of the senshi&#39;s 
diligence. Grandpa was in for a pleasant 
surprise when he got home! 
  Eventually the girls were alone, and 
rearranged the house so each of them could be 
comfortable. When they were finally satisfied, 
they were exhausted. They took a shower together 
and managed to keep their hands off of one 
another. 
  Usagi called her mom to see if she was all 
right.
  Ikuko sniffled when she answered the phone. 
  &quot;Moshimoshi, Tsukino Ikuko!&quot;
  &quot;Mom, it&#39;s me. Are you all right?&quot; Usagi 
asked.
  &quot;I&#39;ll be all right eventually, but right now I 
miss you terribly. It&#39;s as if the soul has been 
sucked out of this quiet house. You are so 
energetic and have so many friends!&quot; 
  Ikuko wasn&#39;t able to continue.
  &quot;I&#39;m sorry Mom. I promise I&#39;ll make it as 
normal as possible for you. When Makoto&#39;s 
landlady threatens to shut down our full band 
jams, we&#39;ll move it there! Won&#39;t that be grand?&quot; 
  Ikuko managed a small laugh.
  &quot;I&#39;m sorry Usagi, I must make you feel guilty 
with my selfishness.&quot; Ikuko said and wiped her 
tears. 
  &quot;You don&#39;t need to come here and entertain 
your boring old mom with music practice.&quot;
  Usagi grinned wickedly. 
  &quot;Oh Mom, how many times do I have to tell you 
that you&#39;re neither old nor selfish! You are the 
most unselfish person on the planet!&quot; 
  Ikuko smiled then.
  &quot;I love you, too, Bunny. I&#39;ll see you 
tomorrow, sometime. Bring me some fresh 
vegetables, ok?&quot;
  &quot;I will Mom, and I love you, too. Konnichiha!&quot; 
Usagi hung up tearfully.
  Rei was right there. 
  &quot;You&#39;ve been through a lot lately, Usa, 
haven&#39;t you? Just let me know when you want 
space, and when you want to be close, all 
right?&quot; 
  Usagi nodded.
  &quot;Same goes for you. Right now I need something 
to eat, if you want to join me.&quot; Rei shook her 
head &#39;no&#39;, so Usagi continued, &quot;then I think 
I&#39;ll use my own room tonight. I&#39;m too wound up 
with a million things to think about. 
  Good night, Rei. We&#39;ll talk in the morning, 
ne?&quot; 
  Usagi&#39;s lips trembled as she met Rei&#39;s soft 
warm yielded ones. They kissed and embraced a 
minute or two, then parted. 
  Rei went to meditate in front of the fire, 
while Usagi ate a little of the picnic 
leftovers, and turned in.
  After she thought about recent memories, 
recent decisions made, family and friends... for 
which she carefully prayed for each, her mind 
wandered to the jinja. 
  She thought about what a huge responsibility 
it was. How much time it would consume to run. 
How expensive it was to maintain. What hard work 
it was to keep it presentable. Especially for 
one eighteen year old school girl... or even 
two. 
  If Grandpa were to die, they would have the 
responsibility alone, and more than likely Rei 
would have to drop out of college. Or, she would 
bring in some stranger that Grandpa had lined up 
to help her. Neither prospect appealed to Usagi. 
  &quot;God please help us... help me to learn the 
logistics on how to run a jinja so we are 
prepared to be alone.&quot; Usagi breathed in prayer.
  As she relaxed and closed her eyes, she felt 
something small and warm crawl onto the futon. 
Luna! Usagi gathered her cat into her arms, and 
wept until sleep overcame her.
  Usagi woke sometime later, her soul drawn to 
her mate&#39;s incredible loneliness. Usagi got up, 
used the bathroom, and went to comfort Rei. She 
slipped under the blanket, snuggled close to 
Rei and put her arm around the lonely girl. 
  &quot;I&#39;m here, love, no more tears. No more 
loneliness.&quot; 
  Usagi spoke softly and felt Rei relax.

                   * * *          
  The girls woke in each other&#39;s arms, which 
seemed to feel more natural and comfortable as 
time went on. Rei&#39;s large amethyst eyes met 
Usagi&#39;s deep blue sapphire ones. Rei smiled 
shyly at her sleepy angel and tentatively leaned 
in for a morning kiss. 
  Usagi met those soft sensuous lips and ran her 
fingers through Rei&#39;s tangled raven locks and 
drew her close. There was nothing tentative 
about Usagi&#39;s kiss. Then she opened her mouth 
and offered Rei deep access for several minutes. 
Usagi moaned softly as Rei&#39;s passion filled her 
with heat.
  &quot;Mmmm... Ohhh Rei!&quot; Usagi was gasping for air, 
&quot;my lungs just got well, and now you&#39;re trying 
to suck them out! How about I fix some breakfast 
while you shower, hmm?&quot;
  Rei laughed. 
  &quot;Sorry, I guess I got carried away... you have 
that effect on people! I would love some 
breakfast. I could have sworn, though, I was 
supposed to spoil you rotten, not the other way 
around.&quot;
  &quot;Rei, you gave me a home! You gave me 
yourself. I am spoiled!&quot; Usagi exclaimed.
  &quot;Oh sweetheart! I just asked if you would 
complete my home. My real home is with you!&quot; 
  Rei kissed Usagi gently then. She went to get 
a towel and take her shower, and left Usagi with 
a silly smile on her face.
  Usagi went to her own room and saw Luna curled 
up on her futon. She put on her housecoat and 
nudged Luna a little with her toe to wake her 
up. 
  &quot;If you want some breakfast, come now, 
otherwise you are on your own. And if you so 
much as glance at Rei&#39;s birds around here, I&#39;ll 
de-claw you!&quot;
  Luna preened herself and stuck her nose in the 
air. 
  &quot;Hmph! Oh ye of little faith. Artemis and I 
have never hunted for birds here, just mice. If 
you like, I&#39;ll leave all the cute little temple 
mice alone too.&quot;
  Usagi blanched. 
  &quot;No, no, you can hunt and eat all the mice you 
want, as long as you don&#39;t eat them inside the 
jinja. Yuck!!&quot; 
  Usagi made haste to the kitchen. She made 
scrambled eggs, set out some yogurt, and cut a 
grapefruit in half. She served it with water, 
and some caffeinated green tea.
  Rei looked shocked when she saw the spread of 
food. 
  &quot;Isn&#39;t this a little much?&quot;
  Usagi&#39;s eyes sparkled with happiness. 
  &quot;Nope, and none of it is fattening. You&#39;ll 
feel wonderful! Eat up, today is going to be a 
great day!&quot; Usagi tapped Rei&#39;s plate and started 
on her own eggs.
  Rei discovered she was pretty hungry after 
all, and when the two girls started to feed one 
another grapefruit chunks, Rei discovered food 
wasn&#39;t the only thing she was hungry for. 
  &quot;Um, Usagi, do you think we are ready for a 
blood bond ceremony?&quot; Rei asked then offered a 
piece of fruit to Usagi with her lips.
  Usagi nibbled the fruit until her lips met 
Rei&#39;s and swallowed before she kissed her. 
  &quot;I&#39;m ready.&quot; She said and she went in after 
Rei&#39;s piece. Usagi swallowed her prize and 
smiled. 
  Rei sucked the juice off Usagi&#39;s chin and 
kissed her lips back.
  &quot;Me too! How about tonight? Can you talk to 
your Mom?&quot; Rei looked at her with hunger in her 
eyes.
  &quot;Did I not say today was going to be a great 
day?&quot; Usagi put a delicate pointer finger on the 
tip of her friend&#39;s nose.
  &quot;You did indeed. Oh Usa, I love you!&quot; Rei 
cried, and hugged her slight jinja mate a little 
too vigorously.
  &quot;Ooof. Rei, I love you too, but a little air 
would be nice!&quot; Usagi squeaked out.
  Rei let go and blushed. 
  &quot;Sorry, you just made me the happiest woman in 
the universe!&quot;
  Usagi felt a pang of guilt as she remembered 
those very words spoken to Mamoru not too long 
ago.  
  &quot;I&#39;m glad I can make you happy, that means a 
great deal to me. You make me incredibly happy, 
too. You just reminded me, though, of something 
I recently said to Mamoru. 
  Maybe I&#39;m not as over Mamoru as I thought I 
was. I should try to be honest and fair to you.&quot;
Usagi&#39;s voice was quiet and uncertain. 
  Rei squeezed Usagi&#39;s hand. 
  &quot;Sweetheart, I will wait for you as long as it 
takes for you to be healed both mentally as well 
as physically.&quot; 
  Usagi shook her head decisively. 
  &quot;No Rei, I... I don&#39;t want to wait. I want to 
be a part of you now, before something happens 
to one of us. I&#39;m scared I&#39;ll lose you, too.&quot; 
  Usagi laid her head on Rei&#39;s shoulder, and 
allowed herself to melt into Rei&#39;s tender 
embrace.
  &quot;I&#39;m not going anywhere.&quot; Rei said gently, &quot;I 
do know how you feel. I was scared to death 
while you were sick. I wanted you in my arms the 
whole time, because I was afraid if I let go, I 
would lose you.&quot; 
  Usagi sniffed, then gave a watery smile.
  &quot;Good. Now we&#39;re even. That&#39;s how I felt when 
I saw pills and alcohol in your trashcan.&quot;
  Rei kissed Usagi&#39;s eyes to remove the wetness.
  &quot;Usa, I also feel an unshakable foreboding 
&#39;senshi kind&#39; of fear from you. I feel it, too. 
The fire only shows me shadows right now. I 
think it has something to do with the &#39;Gate 
Keeper&#39;... maybe Pluto, though the face most 
resembles Sensei Celeste. Perhaps it is she who 
is in danger this time... not one of us.&quot; 
  Rei squeezed her new jinja mate. 
  &quot;There&#39;s a song I&#39;d like to play for you on 
the piano, Usagi, that I found. Maybe it will 
bring you some comfort.&quot; Rei circled her 
friend&#39;s trim waist and led her over to the Baby 
grand and patted the end of the bench.
  &quot;Sit. I don&#39;t know who wrote this, but, who 
ever did must have known you, and how I feel 
about you... &quot;

You&#39;re the bravest of hearts, 
you&#39;re the strongest of souls.
You&#39;re my light in the dark, 
you&#39;re the place I call home.
You can say it&#39;s alright,
but I know you&#39;re breaking up inside.
I see it in your eyes.
Even you face the night afraid and alone.
That&#39;s why I&#39;ll be there.

When the storm rises up, 
when the shadows descend.
Every beat of my heart, 
every day without end. 
Every second I live, 
that&#39;s the promise I make. 
Baby, that&#39;s what I&#39;ll give, 
If that&#39;s what it takes.

You can sleep in my arms, 
you don&#39;t have to explain. 
When your heart&#39;s crying out, 
baby, whisper my name. 
&#39;Cause I&#39;ve reached out for you 
when the thunder is crashing up above,
you&#39;ve given me your love. 
When you smile like the sun 
that shines through the pain. 
That&#39;s why I&#39;ll be there. 

When the storm rises up, 
when the shadows descend. 
Every beat of my heart, 
every day without end. 
I will stand like a rock, 
I will bend &#39;till I break 
&#39;Till there&#39;s no more to give, 
if that&#39;s what it takes. 
I will risk everything, 
I will fight, I will bleed. 
I will lay down my life, 
if that&#39;s what you need. 

Every second I live, 
that&#39;s the promise I make. 
Baby, that&#39;s what I&#39;ll give, 
if that&#39;s what it takes. 

Through the wind and the rain, 
through the smoke and the fire. 
When the fear rises up, 
when the wave&#39;s ever higher. 
I will lay down my heart, 
my body, my soul. 
I will hold on all night, 
and never let go. 
Every second I live, 
that&#39;s the promise I make. 
Baby, that&#39;s what I&#39;ll give, 
if that&#39;s what it takes.

If that&#39;s what it takes, every day.
If that&#39;s what it takes, every day.

  Usagi recognized it immediately, and  smiled.
  &quot;Rei, I thought you liked only singer-song 
writer&#39;s! Celene Dion sang that. I don&#39;t know 
what to say... you&#39;ve always been there for me, 
Rei, and I know you always will be... and I 
thank you. I love you, back the same way.&quot; 
  Rei looked a little chagrined. 
  &quot;I was looking through some of my older albums 
and found this one. Maybe there&#39;s something to 
be said for a collection of well-written songs 
sung beautifully.&quot; Rei enfolded Usagi&#39;s tiny 
waist. 
  Usagi leaned against Rei. 
  &quot;You have the most talented voice in the world 
to me, Rei. You have tremendous range and 
timbre. I am truly blessed by you!&quot;
  Rei blushed.      
  &quot;So... tonight after senshi training, I&#39;ll be 
at my fire to meditate at my usual time. I will 
leave the decision for our ceremony in your 
hands, love.&quot; Rei kissed Usagi&#39;s cheek.
  &quot;Our fire. And I will be there, my passion.&quot; 
Usagi promised. 
  She smiled as Rei&#39;s eyes lit up, then headed 
for the bathroom.
