<h1>Life Just Gets Better (part 5 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/lifebet-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Terri noticed that everyone had gotten used to their new powers. So 
she then began teaching them teleportation outside Senshi form. Once 
that was mastered, Terri showed them how to use their magic in 
everyday life. Like changing clothes and picking things up. This made 
life some what more simple.

Then the first battle came. Terri hadn&#146;t told them much about the 
enemy. She said it could wait until after the first battle.

The Senshi teleported to the park. There they faced eleven youma. 
Which turned into exact copies of them selves.

&#147; Do not be afraid. They are only copies! Look for your weaknesses in 
them!&#148; Sailor Terrestrial the took her stone from it&#146;s place in her 
belt. Held it to her side, called &#147;Terrestrial Beam Sword.&#148; and 
charged her counterpart. The youma attacked first. The Planet Senshi 
quickly ducked. Then sliced the youma through it&#146;s midsection. It 
screamed in agony and disappeared.

&#147; See? I never attack first, just charge. There is a difference. That 
used to be my greatest flaw.&#148; The other Sailors quickly jumped into 
battle while Terrestrial looked toward the sky.

&#147; Do you think me stupid Naraiah? To think I wouldn&#146;t train them for 
such a trick? Show yourself you twit!&#148;

The woman who appeared had lavender hair and piercing lavender eyes. 
Her dress was light blue and clung to her flatteringly. 

&#147; Never would I think you stupid Princess! I simply wanted to see how 
petty your warriors were.&#148; She smiled evilly, obviously not caring 
that the youma she had sent to battle were now dead. 

&#147; Naraiah, before you cower off. Make sure to tell your Lord Dradian 
he shall not win!&#148; With a smirk, Naraiah vanished. Sailor Terrestrial 
turned toward the others. 

&#147; Inners, please stay at the mansion tonight. You don&#146;t want to answer 
any questions as to how you got your injuries. I&#146;ll tell you all about 
the enemy tomorrow.&#148; Terrestrial detransformed and visibly winced at 
the site of the wounds on her friends. - Thank god for Senshi 
healing.- was all Terri thought as she transported home.
