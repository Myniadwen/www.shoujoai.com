<h1>Super Sailor Mercury: Shattered Ice (part 20 of 34)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/shattice-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>&quot;So what are the Three Lights like?&quot; Chibi-Usa asked
eagerly, the little pink haired girl looking at them
eagerly.

Ami chuckled as they sat at the table at the Outers&#39;
home, sharing dinner with their friends. &quot;We haven&#39;t
really gotten to know them yet,&quot; the blue haired young
lady said mildly, &quot;but they seem to be likeable
enough.&quot;

&quot;I wonder if we can sneak into the school?&quot; Hotaru
mused, sipping her tea. Black hair flowed over the
young woman&#39;s shoulders, matching the black dress she
wore.

&quot;Just don&#39;t get caught at it, please,&quot; Haruka said
wryly as she ate, &quot;or poor Setsuna will have to go
bail you out.&quot;

&quot;Hold off on that idea,&quot; Setsuna said, her own long
black hair tinted with just a bit of green, &quot;I think
we can arrange something eventually.&quot;

&quot;Oh, all right,&quot; Chibi-Usa pouted.

Ami took a drink, washing down more of dinner.
&quot;Terrific as always, Michiru,&quot; she said warmly, &quot;thank
you.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Michiru said from where the light
green haired woman sat by her lover Haruka. She
chuckled as she added, &quot;Setsuna helped, tho.&quot;

Setsuna flushed slightly under Ami&#39;s admiring gaze,
&quot;Just with the final steps.&quot;

Haruka had to smile slightly, watching the two of them
looking at each other so cutely. Giving them a moment
she finally said, &quot;To be honest I&#39;m less interested in
the Three Lights than in that group of mysterious
senshi.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t trust them,&quot; Ami said simply, studying
Haruka thoughtfully. The older woman&#39;s boyish side was
especially evident this evening, the white man&#39;s shirt
and black pants giving her a remarkable androgyny.

&quot;Don&#39;t scold her,&quot; Michiru said gently, &quot;she&#39;s just a
bit paranoid.&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; Haruka protested.

&quot;Understandably so,&quot; Setsuna said honestly, &quot;we don&#39;t
know who they are, other than they&#39;ve helped us twice
now.&quot;

&quot;I want to see them,&quot; Chibi-Usa said to Hotaru softly,
&quot;especially if they&#39;re wearing the little bikini&#39;s
Ami-papa described.&quot;

&quot;Hentai,&quot; Hotaru chuckled.

Ami ate a bit, considering her answer. &quot;It&#39;s as much a
matter of instinct as anything else,&quot; she finally
admitted, &quot;I just don&#39;t think they&#39;re enemies.&quot;

&quot;We chose you as our leader,&quot; Haruka acknowledged,
&quot;it&#39;s your call.&quot; After a second she flashed a grin,
&quot;But I reserve the right to say I told you so later.&quot;

That got a laugh from the others around the table.
Luna bounced onto a chair beside them as the black cat
said, &quot;Those three do sound familiar, Artemis and I
will do some research.&quot;

Artemis looked up from where the white cat was curled
in a ball. &quot;I may need to borrow your computer, Ami,&quot;
he added, &quot;to look into some of the more obscure
sources.&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Ami said, &quot;just get what you can
quickly.&quot; She frowned, &quot;These Phages have me a bit
worried.&quot;

&quot;You were able to transform that &#39;Guts&#39; back to
normal,&quot; Michiru pointed out, &quot;though I&#39;d love to know
where you got the ability to do that.&quot;

Ami tossed a hesitant glance at Chibi-Usa, &quot;Could we
talk about it later?&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Setsuna nodded in understanding.

Hotaru, picking up on the cue, rose as she finished
her meal. &quot;I have a new antique lamp,&quot; she said, &quot;may
I be excused to show it to Chibi-Usa?&quot;

&quot;Please?&quot; Chibi-Usa bounced to her feet.

&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Michiru chuckled as the two young people
raced off. The four women and two cats finished eating
then went into the living room, settling into their
seats. &quot;So what happened?&quot; she asked, snuggling beside
Haruka.

Ami sat beside Setsuna, and then surprised the other
woman by resting her head on her shoulder. &quot;It was
Usagi,&quot; she said softly.

&quot;What?!&quot; both Haruka and Michiru blurted.

&quot;I was fighting a Phage when my mercury broach
opened...&quot; Ami quietly explained the appearance of the
spirit and how she had triggered the new ability in
Sailor Mercury.

&quot;Incredible,&quot; Haruka muttered, running a hand through
her hair. Smiling wryly she continued, &quot;Even with all
we&#39;ve been through, the idea of a ghost still unnerves
me a little.&quot;

Hesitantly Setsuna squeezed Ami&#39;s shoulder in silent
comfort, sensing her lingering distress. &quot;There is a
bond that connects us even past death,&quot; she explained,
&quot;its part of why we seem to be reincarnated in a
group, too.&quot;

&quot;Seriously?&quot; Michiru asked.

&quot;We are drawn together by fate,&quot; Setsuna gently said,
&quot;sometimes in the oddest of circumstances. From
knight-champions in England to warriors of Japan and
settlers in the west, we will always find one
another.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a comforting thought,&quot; Ami smiled. Getting back
on topic she said, &quot;I hate to cut into everyone&#39;s
sleep times, but I suspect we might want to begin
nightly patrols. If a Phage does appear it increases
our chances of stopping it.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll need to go out on all the patrol,&quot; Luna looked
concerned, &quot;as the only one who can cure a Phage.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll manage,&quot; she reassured the cat. Ami looked up at
the others, &quot;But I would like to keep Chibi-Usa and
Hotaru off the patrols, at least for now.&quot; With an
almost motherly concern, &quot;They&#39;re younger and need the
sleep.&quot;

&quot;Do you want us here to keep an eye on them?&quot; Artemis
asked. He had become a close guardian to Hotaru and
Chibi-Usa, living here in the Outers&#39; home with them.

&quot;I&#39;d appreciate it,&quot; Ami said as she rose. She gave
the others a smile and asked, &quot;Shall we start the
patrols tonight?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just glad we don&#39;t need much sleep,&quot; Haruka
complained mildly as they headed out.

Meanwhile, in another part of the city a promotional
dinner party continued, the famous and wealthy
circling the small room. Seiya Kou took a drink of
ginger ale, his expression carefully bland as he
fended off the bosomy blonde.

&quot;You know,&quot; the actress purred as she leaned forward a
bit to highlight her best assets, &quot;the hotel has us in
suites nearby, and I&#39;d like the company.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve kind of previously made a commitment,&quot; Seiya was
actually blushing faintly, his long black ponytail
flowing down the back of his blue suit.

&quot;You already have a date?&quot; she pouted then shrugged,
&quot;Your loss.&quot; Hips swaying she stalked off to try to
ensnare some other young man, leaving a very relieved
Seiya behind.

&quot;Oh thank you,&quot; Seiya muttered.

&quot;You really shouldn&#39;t be lying to the poor girl,&quot;
Taiki said mildly, making Seiya jump in surprise. The
reddish-brown haired man gave his brother an impish
look, sipping his own drink.

Seiya shuddered faintly, &quot;God, she was looking me over
like I was fresh meat.&quot;

&quot;We are,&quot; Taiki shrugged, &quot;at least in the eyes of the
media here.&quot;

&quot;Did our agent say how long we had to stay at this
thing?&quot; Yaten asked crossly, his white hair almost
gleaming. Grumbling, &quot;I haven&#39;t been this bored in a
long while.&quot;

&quot;Not much longer,&quot; Seiya said firmly, &quot;or I&#39;m busting
out.&quot;

&quot;We just have to circulate a bit more,&quot; Taiki
reassured his brothers. They paused a moment then he
asked, &quot;So who were you going on a date with,
Seiya-kun?&quot;

&quot;I lied, remember?&quot; Seiya frowned at Taiki.

&quot;Putting it another way,&quot; Taiki continued, &quot;who would
you want to be going on a date with?&quot;

Seiya was a bit surprised at who instantly came to
mind, the intense, blue haired girl that they had only
just met at school. He was tempted to say Ami Mizuno
but restrained himself, mildly answering, &quot;No one in
particular.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Yaten drawled, clearly not buying it.</pre>
