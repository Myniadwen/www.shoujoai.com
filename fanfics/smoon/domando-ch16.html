<h1>Mi Domando Se Li Vedro Ancora (part 16 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/domando-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>The song is called &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; by Linkin Park. I don&#39;t own the 
song nor Sailor Moon.
Makoto blinked and also looked up, her breath catching in her throat.

Floating above all the carnage, was a young man. He was wearing a blue 
jacket with white pants. He also had dark blue hair.

Makoto blinked.

&quot;..Yung Hu?..&quot;

Memories consume
Like opening the wound
I&#39;m picking me apart again
You all assume
I&#39;m safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

The young man silently floated down to the two girls. He blinked when he 
heard Makoto call him &quot;Yung Hu.&quot;

&quot;Yung Hu,&quot; he asked. &quot;No. My name is Sapphire. I am here to warn you...&quot;

Minako growled. &quot;Oh yeah. Warn us to stay out of your business or you&#39;ll 
kill us? Well, I have news for you! Venus Star Power, Make-up!&quot; A swirl 
of orange and yellow energey transformed Minako into Sailor Venus. &quot;I am 
going to kick your ass!&quot;

Sapphire blinked then shook his head. &quot;I don&#39;t want a fight! I came to 
warn you about the monster thats terrorizing your city.&quot;

Makoto and Venus glanced at one another before looking back to Saphire 
then saying at the same time, &quot;...Why?&quot;

&quot;Long story. Lets just say I don&#39;t like how my brother is running 
things...&quot; Sapphire sighed and continued. &quot;The monster is a dragon-&quot;

&quot;Too bad I can&#39;t change forms again...&quot; Makoto said.

&quot;-But she isn&#39;t a real dragon.&quot; Sapphire looked to Venus. &quot;You know all 
the attacks recently? She was in charge of those youma. But she failed 
and this was her punishment.&quot;

&quot;How do we destroy her,&quot; Venus asked.

Sapphire sighed. &quot;That I do not know. All I know is that she was cursed. 
And she&#39;s been unleashed here to destroy your city. I believe she thinks 
it will lift the curse if she succeedes at this. And if not...-&quot;

&quot;..She&#39;ll die...&quot; Makoto said.

Sapphire nodded. &quot;An all or nothing situation, if you will.&quot;

A shaking sensation in the ground made the three of them stumble, having 
to grab onto to things to keep steady.

&quot;Oh great! So we have to fight her duing an earth quake,&quot; Venus yelled. 
&quot;Can&#39;t you people ever give us heros a friggin&#39; break!?&quot;

&quot;Uh, that was no earth quake,&quot; Makoto said.

Venus blinked and looked to Makoto. &quot;How do you know?&quot;

Makoto said nothing, but instead pointed. Venus, as well as Sapphire, 
followed Makoto&#39;s hand and they both gulped loudly.

The three of them stood in silence as the monster formaly known as 
Emerald came stomping into view.

Makoto blinked, and feeling incrediably silly despite the crisis at 
hand, yelled, &quot;OH MY GOD! ITS GODZILLA!&quot;

Venus blinked and turned to Makoto. &quot;You just did NOT say that!&quot;

Makoto shrugged. &quot;You should call the others.&quot;

Venus nodded and got out her communicator to call the others.

Makoto turned to Sapphire. &quot;Who cursed her?&quot;

Saphire growled and looked to the ground. &quot;Wise Man...&quot;

Makoto blinked. &quot;Who?&quot;

Before Sapphire could answer, Venus cut in. &quot;The others are on their 
way. We need to find a way to stop that monster!&quot;

&quot;Aggreed but how?&quot; They turned to Sapphire who only shook his head. 
Venus sighed then turned to Makoto.

&quot;You&#39;re hiding!&quot;

Makoto blinked. &quot;Excuse ME?!&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t transform so you&#39;ll be more of a help to the enemy then to 
us! You&#39;re staying OUT of the fight!&quot; Before Makoto could argue the 
point, Venus took off into the direction of the dragon.

Sapphire blinked then turned to an angry Makoto. &quot;Excuse me, but, whats 
Godzilla?&quot;

&quot;She is NOT leaving me out of this fight!&quot; With that said, Makoto ran 
forward, chasing after the blonde.

I don&#39;t want to be the one
The battles always choose
Cause inside I realize
That I&#39;m the one confused
I don&#39;t know what&#39;s worth fighting for
Or why i have to scream
I don&#39;t know why I instigate
And say what I don&#39;t mean
I don&#39;t know how I got this way
I know it&#39;s not alright
So I&#39;m breaking the habit
Tonight

In a matter of minutes, the rest of the senshi had shown up. However, 
Emerald, in her cuurent state, had trashed most of the city.

&quot;We need to get her out of here,&quot; yelled Mercury, avoiding the falling 
debris, &quot;Or she&#39;s going to kill us and innocent bystanders!&quot;

The other nodded and Makoto asked, &quot;Whats her weak point, Mercury?&quot;

Venus glared at Makoto. &quot;I told you to leave!&quot;

&quot;NO!&quot;

Mars groaned. &quot;Save the lover&#39;s quarrel for later, please!&quot;

Sailor Moon gulped and jumped out of the way as Emerald&#39;s tail cam 
crashing down at her. &quot;Assuming there IS a later!&quot;

&quot;We have got to do something,&quot; Makoto said. &quot;Mercury! Did you ome up 
with anything?&quot;

Mercury shook her head. &quot;No, I can&#39;t find anything.&quot;

Makoto turned to Sapphire. &quot;Other than her pyshical apperance, whats 
different?&quot;

Sapphire blinked and looked up at the dragon. &quot;..The crown. She never 
wore one...&quot;

Makoto nodded. &quot;It could be causeing the curse. Attack that!&quot;

Venus glared at Makoto.

&quot;Don&#39;t EVEN say a word, Venus,&quot; Makoto said.

&quot;Well, how do we damage the crown,&quot; Sailor Moon asked. &quot;We&#39;ve been 
attacking her head and it didn&#39;t even phaze her!&quot;

Makoto looked at the crown. &quot;Maybe something sharp...like a sword.&quot;

Mars raised her eyebrow. &quot;Yes, well, lets just walk to the nearest drug 
store and pick one up!&quot;

Makotot was about to say something, but another voice cut her off.

&quot;No need,&quot; said the voice, &quot;you may borrow mine..&quot;

Clutching my cure
I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more
Than anytime before
I had no options left again
I don&#39;t know what&#39;s worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don&#39;t know why I instigate
And say what I don&#39;t mean
I don&#39;t know how I got this way
I know it&#39;s not alright
So I&#39;m breaking the habit
Tonight

The senshi and Sapphire turned to see a humanoid white cat standing 
behind them. He had blue eyes, and something golden sparkled on his 
forhead. The only armour he wore was on his chest. At his hip he had a 
sword sheath, but his sword was drawn and in his left hand.

Venus blinked. &quot;..Artemis?&quot;

He only smiled. He then turned to Makoto and offered her his sword, hilt 
first.

&quot;You will need this.&quot;

Makoto blinked and took the sword from him. &quot;Thanks...&quot;

He nodded. &quot;I suggest you get to the top of a building if you plan on 
attacking her crown like you thought of. It would be the only place you 
could reach it and have a chance.&quot;

Makoto nodded and turned, then broke out into a run towards the nearest 
building that Emerald was near. Venus had tried to stop her, but she 
didged the blond easily and continued to run.

Makoto ran to the side of the building, and something in her made her 
move faster. She was able to climb the stairs to reach the roof in a 
matter of few minutes. She stood, catching her breath.

When she looked up she saw Emerald&#39;s scaley head turn toward her and the 
dragon&#39;s eyes narrowed. Makoto glared back and clutched the sword with 
both hands then began to run at top speed again.

Emerald roared out and lashed her head forward, a river of fire 
bellowing out of her mouth towrad Makoto. Makoto jumped high, much 
higher then she should have in civilan form and arched back, raising the 
sword above her head. As she fell forward, the blade sunk deep into the 
crystal in the crown atop Emerald&#39;s head...

I&#39;ll paint it on the walls
Cause I&#39;m the one at fault
I&#39;ll never fight again
And this is how it ends
I don&#39;t know what&#39;s worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity
To show you what i mean
I don&#39;t know how I got this way
I&#39;ll never be alright
So I&#39;m breaking the habit
Breaking the habit tonight</pre>
