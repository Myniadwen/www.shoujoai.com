<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 11 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><p><i><b>Creeeeeak</b></i></p><p>Celeste opened the door just a crack and peered into the 
hallway. She glanced both ways, and from she could see, at least, the woman was pretty sure 
that they were in the clear (many of other members remained behind and continued on with the 
meeting). But for the sake of being extra cautious, she shooed a wisp of air down the two 
paths. Only until both streams returned with their reports did she finally give the go ahead 
and gestured for Minako to follow her away from the busy crowd.</p><p>“This way,” She 
waved.</p><p>“Mm.” Minako nodded.</p><p><b>Tup… tup… tup…</b></p><p><b>Tup… tup… 
tup…</b></p><p>The path that they were travelling along was quickly changing. Deeper into 
the servant headquarters was an underground maze of stone-made tunnels. It was significantly 
darker-- at times, the two women would come upon sections where they were forced to feel 
their way along the wall (well, Minako had to anyway. She could hear her guide breeze 
through without a problem, quite literally). Getting a little impatient as she watched her 
companion made distance on her, the Venusian stubbornly began to let go of the wall and 
decided to charge her way out. She may have gotten somewhere if she hadn’t tripped from the 
first step and smacked back into the wall.</p><p>The humming ahead of her stopped. “Lady 
Venus? Is everything all right?”</p><p>“Juuuuust peachy.” Minako mumbled as she rubbed her 
poor nose. It was always the nose, wasn’t it? She could feel her companion’s curious stare. 
“I’m fine, really!”</p><p>She heard the humming begin again. With a sigh, Minako forced 
herself to make a speedy gain on her composure. She had only been down here for a few 
minutes, but she was already getting sick of it. In fact, she chalked it up as one big 
disappointment. Where was the marble, the carpets or the portraits? Where was the scent of 
fresh air? Here, underground, there was essentially nothing. It was just a dark, dank, 
miserable place.</p><p><i>This place is almost like a prison. Is this really the servant’s 
quarters? But how can they possibly live down here? </i>Minako’s gaze scaled the bare walls 
and traveled along the ground that they walked upon but it all looked the same to her. 
Everything felt so closed in and crowded.</p><p>“Hey, about earlier...? I’m really sorry 
about that…”</p><p>“Huh? W-What are you apologizing for?” Minako nearly jumped when the 
other woman suddenly spoke up. Celeste silently took a few extra steps forward before she 
turned around to face her guest.</p><p>“Well… For one, I shouldn’t have jumped to 
conclusions.” The third commander admitted slowly. Her gaze fell to the floor in mixed 
embarrassment and shame. “It’s exactly as Soren said-- I should have noticed that you were 
different. To be honest, I just assumed that you were one of our recruits because of your 
appearance. A mistake of that caliber on the battlefield could put people in danger! But 
it’s not like I’m unhappy that you got to meet Soren—I am! It’s just, the way that it 
happened. Do you kinda get what I’m saying?”</p><p>“Yeah, but we all make mistakes sometimes 
right? And it really wasn’t your fault. I mean, your people rarely receive visitors from 
Venus right?”</p><p>“That’s true. But that’s another reason why I wanted to apologize. I 
wish you didn’t have to see us like this-- cowering away down here in the midst of a civil 
war. Things weren’t always like this. If only you could have seen it before Sir Haruka had 
disappeared…”</p><p>“Hmm...Well, you could always tell me about it.” Minako suggested with a 
smile. She was glad to see the other woman start to smile back shyly.</p><p>“Actually, I 
know what I can do! I can just show you! You see, there’s a wind chamber further down below. 
Since it may take awhile before everyone’s ready, we can sneak down there for a bit to pass 
the time. They always take forever anyway. What do you think? Would you like to see 
it?”</p><p>“Well, I kinda do... but... didn’t Soren tell us to keep a low profile? Do you 
think it’ll be safe?”</p><p>“Of course it is! We’re pretty far down, so the chances of 
anyone finding us are pretty slim. Besides, it’s a lot better than this 
place.”</p><p><i>Oh.</i></p><p>“Okay. Well, when you put it that way, then sure, why not?” 
Minako gave a nervous laugh. <i>At least she seems enthusiastic about it…</i></p><p><u>(Wind 
Chamber)</u></p><p>Minako wasn’t sure what to expect. When Celeste first mentioned the wind 
chamber, the first thing that came to mind was a giant tunnel filled with vicious, swirling 
winds. But the diplomat quickly found out that she wasn’t completely wrong-- it actually was 
a nicer place than the stone maze.</p><p>When both women exited one of the narrowing paths 
into the chamber, the first thing Minako noticed was how fresh the air was. It wasn’t heavy 
or damp smelling, but light and clean. If it were possible, she could have sworn it was 
purer than the air above the surface; her entire body felt alive and was tingling with 
energy.</p><p><b>Wooooooooosh…</b></p><p>“Oh wow…” Minako breathed. She had to briefly cover 
her eyes from the initial brightness. It wasn’t until her eyes adjusted that she was able to 
understand why Celeste was so insistent on coming to this place.</p><p>The wind chamber was 
a large, spacious room, whose ceiling arched so high up that one could not see the roof 
above. On the lower floor, a few steps down from where they stood, there were marble statues 
of various people Minako had never seen before. Some of the figurines resembled warriors 
brandishing swords and bows, while others took on more cultured and dignified poses. 
However, there were two in particular that really caught the diplomat’s eye; near the middle 
of the room, by a large, floating sphere there were two miniature figurines of very opposite 
looking women. One statue was shaped in the form of a long legged figure. She possessed 
wild, short hair and wore a suit of armor, while the one that sat beside it almost embodied 
a gentler, noble soul-- she was a woman with flowing, shoulder-length hair. Unlike her 
companion, she catered to a refined culture and wore a long, thin dress.</p><p>Perhaps it 
was because of the strange atmosphere, but Minako took a step forward into the room, almost 
mesmerized, and blindly stepped into something wet.</p><p><b>Sploosh!</b></p><p>“Ah!” She 
recoiled in surprise. “Wha-What is--?! O-Oh... It’s just water?” She splashed a handful 
aside, confirming her suspicions.</p><p><i>But what’s water doing in a place like 
this?</i></p><p>Against the white background, the liquid blended in perfectly. She knew that 
Rei would likely laugh at her if the woman ever found out, so it was a good thing that she 
never would.</p><p>“Oops, sorry...! I guess I should have warned you about that,” Celeste 
called out. She had already made it across the room and now stood by the floating orb. “That 
wasn’t always there, so don’t feel bad. I used to always fall into it too. You get used to 
it after awhile though.”</p><p>“G-Great…” Minako shivered. <i>Not that I want to get used to 
it.</i> She didn’t want to get soaked again anytime soon. “Umm… so, how do I get over to you 
without…?”</p><p>“Hold on, I’ll fix that in a sec.” Celeste momentarily turned her back to 
her guest and concentrated down on the floating orb. She held her palms out to the object 
and began to whisper incantations under her breath. The orb responded immediately. In a 
blink of an eye the white texture of the room was altered, and it now gave off a blue glow. 
The streams flowing around the hard floor were suddenly visible.</p><p>“There, that should 
do it. Can you see things better?”</p><p>“Yes, thank you.” This time she was easily able to 
cross the room. “So… what did you want to show me?”</p><p>“This.” Again the orb began to 
vibrate. “When you suggested about telling you what our planet used to be like, it hit me! 
Like I said, I can just show you! With this! While Mercury has their technology to tell them 
the on-goings of their people, and Mars has their soldiers (we used to do that too)… we now 
use the wind. Everything that happens on our planet is recorded by this system through the 
use of wind cycles. You see, there are certain mainstreams of air that circulate around our 
planet and they all cycle past the palace constantly. This machine here can show projections 
of the past by re-creating the same wind vibrations of the event during that 
day.”</p><p>With that, Celeste summoned an image. Before Minako’s eyes appeared a different 
view of the capital city of Caelus. The buildings appeared very much the same, but the 
streets were covered with troops in Uranus’s golden armor. It greatly reminded Minako of her 
visit on Mars.</p><p>“It looks like there’s some sort of celebration,”Minako wondered 
aloud.</p><p>“This was what it was like when our former ruler was in power.” Celeste pointed 
to the front of the crowd. One could see a younger version of Soren standing at the front 
with the former Uranus and the God’s young heir. The young heir however didn’t look very 
impressed with the festivities. In fact, she looked rather bored. “There’s Soren standing on 
his right, and our current ruler to his left. This was her in her younger days. Sir Haruka 
really doesn’t seem too happy, does she?”</p><p>“Haruka? She?” Minako thought she had heard 
people address Uranus’s ruler as female, but she usually brushed it aside due to bad 
hearing. After encountering the wind ruler in the battlefield, she swore she looked like a 
<i>he</i>.</p><p>“That’s our ruler’s name. And yeah, she’s a 
GIRL.”</p><p><i>Seriously?!</i></p><p>Celeste laughed a little at seeing Minako’s confused 
expression. “It’s hard to believe when you first see her, I know… but it’s another thing you 
get used to after awhile. I’ve known her for a long time now, since way back when we used to 
live on the streets together.”</p><p>“You used to live on the streets…?”</p><p>The images 
from the sphere began to change once more.</p><p>“Mm. Our former ruler had a war-thirsty 
attitude that could have rivalled Mars’s ruler, Ares. As far back as I can remember, our 
planet was always at war with the red planet and many of us were orphaned because of it. It 
wasn’t uncommon back then to see orphans joining the military or struggling on the streets…” 
In a quieter voice, she then said, “I remember how Haruka used to get so angry about it. She 
used to hate Uranus. Because of that... we would often get into fights with our own 
soldiers. But that’s probably why the former Uranus even noticed her. That man was very 
competitive and extremely prideful. He could never stand the thought of being outdone by 
Ares. I think… that’s why he took Haruka off the streets. Knowing him, once he heard the 
Martian ruler had picked up a girl from the streets and was raising her as a soldier from 
essential scratch, he wanted to do the same. It was like a challenge to him. When he first 
asked Haruka, she still hated him, but she only agreed to join him for my sake—I was… a very 
weak child back then. I was always tripping and falling down… If she hadn’t come along in 
the first place, I might not be here today. Honestly, that’s why it always made me feel 
guilty. She always said that it was her own choice, but sometimes I can’t help but feel like 
I forced her into it somehow...”</p><p>“<i>But Haruka!”</i></p><p>“<i>Don’t try to stop me 
Celeste. I’ve already made up my mind!” The young girl shouted.<br></i><br>“…”</p><p>The 
scenery changed to show another section of the palace. It appeared to be the throne room, 
given its excessive decoration of furniture and jewellery.</p><p>“But I couldn’t bear to let 
her do it by herself. So I enlisted as well. Shortly after we were recruited into the 
military, we met Kali and Soren.”</p><p><i>...Kali. </i>The name struck a bell to Minako. 
<i>I think Soren mentioned that she was the other person who was third in 
command</i>.</p><p>“You spoke about her earlier. If you don’t mind me asking, what is she 
like?”</p><p>“You mean Kali? Well, where to start? She’s is also a third ranked commander, 
we both share the position,” Celeste explained. “As for what she’s like… hmm… it’s hard to 
really explain. She was almost wild when we first met her, and extremely reckless. Kinda 
like Haruka! So, as you can imagine, we first met her she wasn’t very talkative or friendly. 
It really took awhile before we became friends.” Celeste sighed, and shook her head. The 
past was the past but there were still some things that really made her think. “I think the 
reason that she hated us... was because Uranus had initially chosen Kali to be his heir. 
Soren told us all about it in private later. Apparently, Uranus thought that Kali might’ve 
had potential since she was Soren’s little sister… but he soon grew tired of her and picked 
up Haruka instead. It might sound a little twisted, but I think he liked Haruka’s 
hate.”</p><p>“Are you serious?” <i>What sort of person could be so twisted to enjoy 
hate?</i></p><p>Celeste nodded. “I used to worry about Haruka a lot after she agreed to 
become the heir. But strangely enough, after she started to attend the Planetary Meetings 
she began to change.”</p><p>“Change? Like how...?” She saw her companion smile.</p><p>“Well, 
whenever she came back, and we were alone, she would tell Soren, Kali and me about the 
cookies she got to ‘borrow’. We would all just laugh and laugh at her stunts... especially 
when she began to execute them here at home. Uranus wasn’t very impressed, but Haruka was 
pretty careful not to get caught. It made me so happy to see her like that, smiling and 
laughing… It was like she finally found something important to her.”</p><p>“Or perhaps a 
special someone?” Minako casually suggested.</p><p>“You know, we kinda thought so too. Soren 
and Kali would used to tease her about it so bad! The only thing that could shut them up was 
a threat to put them on clean-up duty.”</p><p><i>Clean up duty? That sounds like something 
Rei would do…</i> Minako thought back to her visit in Mar’s palace. <i>All those poor men 
were sent to clean up duty because…? Hmm… now that I think about it, what was the reason 
again? Nosebleeds...?</i></p><p>“But you know, one day she just came back and really 
surprised us all. Do you know what Haruka told us?”</p><p>“Someday…”</p><p>“<i>Someday… I’ll 
become the wind!”</i></p><p>“She wants to become the wind…?”Minako blinked. “Is that even 
possible?”</p><p>Celeste merely pointed up to the new scene projected above their 
heads.</p><p>In the throne room, the former Uranus and his heir, Haruka, were now staring 
one another down. But Haruka looked different. She had considerably matured. Her dark green 
eyes possessed a new sort of intensity to them and her body had grown. The man who stood 
before her appeared to be in his mid-thirties. He was adorned in Uranus’s royal armor and 
carried the royal sword by his waist, unlike Haruka who had none. The woman only boldly 
approached him as she was, without armor and with her head held 
high.</p><p><b>…</b></p><p>“<i>What is it girl? Why do you disturb 
me?”</i></p><p>“<i>...”</i></p><p>“<i>Speak! I am quickly losing my patience. This has 
better not be another one of your games; I am a busy man.”</i></p><p>“<i>All right... I’ll 
tell you what’s up. I’m here to challenge you for the throne!” She 
declared.</i></p><p><i>Uranus laughed. “Are you saying that you wish to attempt the Rite of 
Ascension? It has never been done before and for a good reason! For a human to become a God, 
the human must first defeat a God.” His eyes gleamed dangerously. “You are still nothing but 
a mere child. Do you really not see the difference between us Haruka? If I so choose, I can 
kill you with a single sweep of my sword!”</i></p><p><i>A serious expression crossed 
Haruka’s face. The God took it as a sign that her faith was 
wavering.</i></p><p>“<i>Hey...You said that your sword can control the wind right?” 
</i></p><p>“<i>That’s right.” Uranus boasted.</i></p><p>“<i>Heh.” Haruka suddenly flashed a 
grin.</i> <i>“What kind of Ruler of the Wind… needs a sword to control 
it?!”</i></p><p>“<i>What? Enough games girl, you have already wasted enough of my 
time.”</i></p><p><i>But Haruka wasn’t about to stop.</i></p><p>“<i>Are you going to run 
away? Maybe, all this time... the wind was just waiting for someone who was truly 
worthy!”</i></p><p><i><b>Snap.</b></i></p><p>“<i>You dare mock me?!” Uranus drew his sword 
and pointed it towards Haruka. “Mark my words Haruka, I will not hesitate to kill you! But 
if you apologize now and beg for your life, I may pardon your actions just this once. Need I 
remind you that you can be replaced?”</i></p><p>‘<i>I can’t back down now, and I won’t!’ 
Haruka thought to herself. ‘Because… I made a promise.’</i></p><p>“…<i>You can be replaced 
too.”</i></p><p>“<i>That does it!” The God thundered. “I’ve given you your warning, but you 
leave me with no choice! Regret your decision... in the afterlife!”</i></p><p><b>Foom… foom… 
</b></p><p><i>His sword began to</i> <i>glow.</i></p><p>“<i>HaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAH!” Uranus 
swung the blade and hurled a strong wind against his 
heir.</i></p><p><b>FwooooooooOOSH!</b></p><p><i>But Haruka didn’t flinch. She didn’t even 
lift a finger to shield herself from the deadly blast. She didn’t have to-- the attack was 
easily overcome by a different surge of air. Wind currents from outside suddenly converged 
down towards the palace and smashed through the surrounding windows, raining glass shards 
down into the area. The guards all shouted and ducked down, covering their heads. 
</i></p><p><i><b>Rumble, rumble, rumble…</b></i></p><p><i>The palace shook as the wind 
barrier picked up around Haruka, effectively turning the tides of battle. Before the God 
could comprehend what was happening, his attack was flung back him with an unstoppable 
force.</i></p><p>“<i>W-What? NO! It’s...Errrrg- 
Impossible!”</i></p><p><i><b>WOOOOO----------OOOSH—CrAsh!</b></i></p><p>“<i>GaaaAAAAAAAH!”</i></p><p><i>As 
Uranus fell to his knees, the air around Haruka died down until it released the building 
from its thunderous grip. However it never completely faded; it stayed with its chosen 
master and pulsed as a thin layer around her body protectively.</i></p><p>“<i>Game over, I 
win.” Haruka remarked.</i></p><p>“<i>N-No…” Uranus gasped. But Haruka ignored him as she 
went to pick up the former God’s sword.</i></p><p><i>Almost immediately the wind leapt from 
her and swarmed Uranus, encircling him until it stripped him of his royal armor—almost 
instantly all of the magical metal was removed and replaced onto a more worthy individual. 
There was a bright flash of a light that lit the area before it finally faded and revealed 
Haruka, the former heir of Uranus, standing before the man not as a mere human any longer, 
but a Goddess.</i></p><p>“<i>Damn you...! How could this happen?!” Uranus cursed. But he 
knew he had been defeated. His wounds were not healing, presenting further proof that he was 
now mortal. If he were lucky, time would soon ravage his body and turn him into an old, 
feeble man without any power whatsoever. If he was not, then the only option that remained 
was death. Facing these two possible outcomes made him wonder if there was any point in 
living.</i></p><p>“<i>Geh… fine, I acknowledge that you’ve gotten stronger. Go ahead and 
kill me. But you better do it right child!”</i></p><p>“<i>No.” Haruka turned her back and 
began to walk away from the man.</i></p><p>“<i>What?! Come back here and finish the 
job!”</i></p><p>“<i>You’ve lived as a God for your entire existence, cursing and ridiculing 
humanity for their weakness. Is death truly appropriate for you? Heh, I think you should 
give living a try. Experience the mortal life and see what your citizens see, feel what they 
feel, and for once, truly know 
vulnerability.”</i></p><p>“<i>Haruka!!!”</i></p><p><b>…</b></p><p>The image faded to an 
overview of the city of Caelus, but it had changed once more. There were scarcely any 
soldiers on the streets. Instead, they were replaced by playing children. Whole families 
were outside helping one another with daily choirs and small outdoor classes were being 
held.</p><p>“After Haruka became ruler, she placed a minimum limit on our soldier recruiting 
age. No one under ten may even be considered. As a result, enrolment has gone down and the 
amount of wars we actively engaged in dropped in number. The way Haruka justified it was 
that we were people of the wind. We should be free, not shackled down by chains of war and 
bloodlust. From then on, we only entered a war to help boost our economy, such as the last 
battle against Mars. Other than that… well, it was what you saw before you.” Celeste waved 
her hand and the orb’s intensity died down, distorting the images until they disappeared 
finally. “Soren tried his best to cover for what happened after Haruka disappeared. I can 
only hope that she comes back soon, for everyone’s sake. If only we knew if she was all 
right…”</p><p>“Hey, I’m sure she is.” Minako tried to cheer the woman up. “She’ll probably 
come back soon and the civil war will be over. Then things can go back to the way they used 
to be.”</p><p>“The war…” Celeste finally sat down on the nearest marble step with Minako 
following close behind her. “Hey...Lady Venus? Can I tell you something?”</p><p>“Sure. And 
please, Minako is fine.”</p><p>“...Minako. All right, I’ll remember that.” She 
paused.</p><p>“So, as you were saying?”</p><p>“Well. Please don’t tell anyone this, but… 
this whole situation kinda scares me.” She admitted quietly.</p><p>“The war, you 
mean?”</p><p>“Mm.” Celeste nodded. “I can’t tell anyone else this, because I’m a third 
ranked commander-- I’m supposed to be strong when the people are weak, even when I don’t 
feel like it. But lately, I don’t know...for something reason, I’ve been feeling really 
scared. Ever since that night Baroach had betrayed us, I’ve been worrying that I might screw 
up. I really trusted him.” She shook her head. “First him, and then Haruka...I don’t want to 
lose Soren or Kali next!” All her held back emotions were coming to the surface, but she 
couldn’t hold them back any longer. “Especially Soren...”</p><p>“You really care about him, 
huh?”</p><p>“Wha—h-hey! I mean, n-not in that way!” Celeste quickly waved her arms. Her 
cheeks were burning bright red. “At least, he doesn’t see me that way …”</p><p>“Oh? Why do 
you say that?”</p><p>“He’s just always busy. He’s strong, loyal, trustworthy…I mean, 
everyone looks up to him. He’s the kind of guy who will sacrifice his life for his home and 
our leader. And I don’t want it to come to that. That’s why I sometimes wish I was more like 
Kali. She’s so incredibly brave and strong... It’s almost like she doesn’t worry about this 
sort of thing as much I do.”</p><p>“But if you were more like her, then you wouldn’t be you 
anymore.” Minako put it simply. “If someone really cares about you, then they’d love you for 
who you are. Besides, you are brave. You just have a different way of showing 
it.”</p><p><i>Although… I think Rei would probably wish that I was less klutzy and loud, and 
uhh…</i></p><p>“Do you have someone you like Minako?”</p><p>Minako blinked. “Wha-a-aaa? 
W-Well, you see-- it’s kind of complicated.”</p><p>“So you do! That’s great! What are they 
like?” Minako could only stare in disbelief at the smiling woman beside her. The spotlight 
had shifted so suddenly! “Please? I told you who I liked! Besides, you wouldn’t be ashamed 
to talk about them, are you…?”</p><p>“No, it’s nothing like that. But, hmm… but it’s kind of 
hard to know where to start.” She scratched her cheek a little.</p><p>“Anywhere is 
fine.”</p><p>“All right... Then, umm…First of all, they are VERY 
stubborn.”</p><p>“Stubborn?”</p><p>“Yeah, they have a very short temper. Or at least, when 
it comes to me they seem to anyway.”</p><p>“Oh wow. Don’t you ever get scared?”</p><p>“No. I 
laugh.”</p><p>Celeste tilted her head, looking confused.</p><p>“I told you it was 
complicated.” Minako reminded her. “You see, they make a bunch of funny faces whenever they 
lose their cool. So I laugh. Sometimes they would growl and tell you to stop, but the best 
way to deal with it is to give them a BIG hug! Then they would squirm and get all 
embarrassed! It’s quite cute actually.”</p><p>“Yeah...? Well, I guess I’d have to take your 
word for it.”</p><p><i>Though, I’m pretty sure I’d be scared! Minako sure is one brave 
woman.</i> Celeste secretly thought.</p><p>“But underneath all that… they’re very 
kind-hearted. I think many people miss that part of them because they’re easily swayed by 
first impressions. Even when I first met them, I wasn’t sure what to think. But, as we 
started to spend more time together, I beginning to see sides to them that I couldn’t see 
before. They’re loyal, dependable, protective, caring… Whenever I’m with them, I’m happy! 
It’s like my heart feels like it’s going to burst! Especially when we hold hands…” She said 
quietly.</p><p><i>I don’t think it’s a simple love anymore. I think... I might actually 
be…</i></p><p>“How touching.”</p><p>Both women jumped. When they turned towards the voice, 
their eyes widened when they spotted the figure by the chamber entrance.</p><p>“Baroach?!” 
Minako was stunned. Suddenly the room, the wind and the water, everything, had fallen 
silent.<i><br></i><br>“Impossible!” Celeste leapt to her feet. “We’re deep inside the 
servant’s quarters! How did you manage to get this far without anyone noticing you?” She 
demanded.</p><p>“Tsk, tsk, my dear Celeste. Haven’t you learned anything over these last few 
years? Nothing is impossible for me” He walked forward to reveal a group of soldiers in 
black armor behind him. “Of course, perhaps… I didn’t quite make it without being noticed, 
but that’s another story.”</p><p>It was then that the noises of fighting drifted into the 
room. There was a fight going on!</p><p>Immediately Celeste whipped out her twin daggers 
from her side pouches. “I’m warning you, Baroach, stay back! Don’t make me fight 
you!”</p><p><b>Tup… tup…</b></p><p>“You’d dare raise your weapons against an old friend? I 
also see that you’ve decided to drop the formality. That’s rather rude of you, considering 
that you’re speaking to a superior.”</p><p>The woman tensed. “Stop it. You stopped being my 
superior from the moment you betrayed us. Why did you do it Baroach?! You always told us 
that it was your dream for the people of the upper and lower lands to live together in 
harmony! Isn’t that why you pleaded with Sir Haruka to let you stay?”</p><p>The man was 
silent.</p><p>“I thought we were all friends! We trusted you! Didn’t any of that mean 
anything to you?”</p><p>“...Hmph. I really thought that you were more competent than this, 
but it looks like I was wrong. You should see yourself right now. You’re so emotional...! 
Even without Soren around, your head is still in the clouds. Is that really any way a 
commander should behave?” He heard the woman gasp. “To put it simply... if you still don’t 
understand then you never will. But that’s enough chit-chat, <i>soldier.</i> If you wish to 
leave this place unharmed, then I strongly suggest that you stay out of this. My business is 
with Mars’s servant, not you. Something’s come up and I require her 
assistance.”</p><p>“Where’s Rei…?” Minako whispered. She couldn’t see the Martian 
anywhere.</p><p>“Rei...? Is that her name?”</p><p>“Where is she?!”</p><p>“What are you 
planning to do with her?” Celeste had recovered and resumed a defensive stance.</p><p>“Well, 
you see... the Martian ruler is proving to be a little difficult. So I needed something to 
convince her otherwise.”</p><p>“...You want to use me as bait.”</p><p>“That’s 
right.”</p><p>At first, Minako was at a loss for words. But then to everyone’s surprise, she 
flipped a handful of hair over her shoulder and chuckled.</p><p>“Well, good luck with that. 
Remember <i>Sir </i>Baroach, I am only a maid. What value am I to a ruler? I can be easily 
replaced.” She gave a convincing laugh, and received a strange backward glance from Celeste. 
Though a part of herself couldn’t help but wonder how much of it was true. How much did she 
mean to Rei?</p><p>“That’s what the Martian said as well. I had almost believed her… But 
when I revealed my plans to the stubborn fool, look what happened.” He lifted the sleeve of 
his left arm and unravelled a large bandage to reveal a long, deep gash that extended from 
the base his hand, up to his elbow. “Apparently it appears that you actually do mean 
something to her.”</p><p><i>Rei…</i> <i>You mean, </i><i>I actually…?</i></p><p>“That was 
right before she was easily subdued. It wasn’t much of a fight.” He laughed.</p><p>Minako 
gasped. Her whole body was suddenly shaking.</p><p>“Don’t listen to him Minako! It’s just 
another one of his lies!” Celeste shouted to her.</p><p>“Celeste my dear, you wound me. What 
would Soren say if he knew--”</p><p>“SHUT UP!” In a blink of an eye she shot forward with 
killer intent. “I’ll take you down right here you traitor!”</p><p><i>I can’t be afraid 
now!</i></p><p><b>TUP!</b></p><p>As she anticipated, many of the soldiers raced forward to 
cut down the approaching threat. Yet each and every one of them was met with a surprise; a 
dagger, a kick, or their own comrade’s sword!</p><p>“Hold 
still!”</p><p><b>Slash!</b></p><p>“Gaaaah!”</p><p><b>Whop!</b></p><p>“Oof!”</p><p>“Why 
you---eh?”</p><p><b>Clank!</b></p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>“Hey-! Hit her, not me!”</p><p>Baroach 
narrowed his eyes as she closed the gap. “Uhh---!”</p><p><b>TUP!</b></p><p>Celeste had leapt 
up and was spiralling down towards him, daggers posed. <i>He’s not moving?! </i>Time 
suddenly seemed to slow down. The wind howled in her ears as she twisted her upper body and 
whipped her daggers at him, one to his head and one aimed at his upper chest. To her 
astonishment, neither attack contacted the target-- in fact they both went right through the 
man as if he was composed of air.</p><p><i>What?!</i> <i>Oh no, it’s an 
illusion?!</i></p><p>“Celeste! Watch out!” Minako cried.</p><p>The commander barely turned 
her head in time to see the guard directly behind the image holding the device. But it was 
too late. The woman fumbled to recover, narrowly evading the soldier’s blade as she felt it 
skim across her cheek. She grunted, alarm bells sounding in her head. She was already 
falling backwards when a metallic boot crashed into the back of her skull from behind and 
knocked her straight into the nearest 
waterway.</p><p><b>Crack!</b></p><p>“AHH!”</p><p><i><b>Roll----</b></i></p><p><b>Splash!</b></p><p>“Ahahahaha!” 
Jeers of laughter followed.</p><p>“Celeste!” Minako screamed, but the other woman lay 
motionless.</p><p><i>She isn’t---! No, she can’t be dead! </i>A thin trickle of blood ran 
down the side of Celeste’s face and dripped into the clear water beneath her, discolouring 
it.</p><p>“What was that?” One of the guards huffed, trying to appear under control. Only 
three of the group remained standing.</p><p>“The third commander I think,” answered the man 
holding the projector device.</p><p>“No matter, she’s now out of our way.” Baroach pointed 
out. “Now, let us resume our conversation before we were so rudely interrupted.” His image 
stepped towards Minako once more.</p><p>“Stay back!” Briefly her blue eyes flashed back to 
Celeste’s downed form. “I have no interest in hearing anymore of your lies!”</p><p>“Oh? So 
you’re saying you’d rather not know what has become of your precious master?”</p><p><i>She’s 
so much like Auranos. </i>Baroach mused. <i>Stubbornly loyal, and so… noble. Ha! She even 
has the same look in her eyes. It’s a shame that the child won’t join me.</i></p><p>“What 
did you do...?”</p><p>“All I did was introduce her to our 
leader.”</p><p><b>…</b></p><p><i><u>(En route to the ‘Meeting 
Room’)</u></i></p><p><i><b>Tup… tup… tup…</b></i></p><p><i>Rei and Baroach had left the 
large gathering room via the left path. For the longest time, the man led her in silence 
across the palace-- nothing suspicious as far as Rei was concerned. However, they soon came 
to a stop within a peculiarly, empty wing. Baroach stepped forward and activated a hidden 
switch, instantly revealing a small, hidden doorway in the wall. Judging by the color 
camouflage and its moving mechanisms, Rei had to admit that she had never seen this secret 
passageway before (it came as a shock because she thought her and Haruka had already 
discovered them all). Regardless, she found herself staring at a staircase that headed 
somewhere underground.</i></p><p>“<i>After you...?” Baroach offered.</i></p><p>“<i>The guide 
should always walk ahead.”</i></p><p>“<i>Yes, as you wish, your Majesty...” He gave another 
slight bow.</i></p><p><i>The Martian cautiously tread behind her guide, watchful for any 
sudden movements. The tunnel was too narrow, and dim lighted for her liking. She could 
barely make out Baroach’s back, let alone the next step.</i></p><p><i>As the two people 
continued to descend they soon encountered the faint fragrance of a putrid stench in the 
air, followed by an unshakable cold. Rei’s first reaction was to cover her nose with her 
hand—what was down here? It smelt worse than blood, and more vulgar than hundreds of rotting 
corpses on a battlefield. It if were plausible, she would have guessed that it was a 
combination of both.</i></p><p>‘<i>How can that be…?’ She questioned herself. They were 
getting closer to the smell, but all she could make out was the rock all around them. For a 
moment she considered challenging Baroach of his intentions, yet it irked her how unaffected 
the man appeared. Didn’t he smell it too? Didn’t he feel the cold? She decided to endure it 
for now. She had no intention of appearing weak now.</i></p><p><i><b>Tup… 
tup…</b></i></p><p>‘<i>It’s getting stronger…’ Rei tried to hold her 
breath.</i></p><p><i><b>Wooooooooooosh…</b></i></p><p><i><b>Tup.</b></i></p><p><i>They had 
finally reached the bottom. Yet to Rei’s surprise, the air was surprisingly clean down here. 
The smell was practically non-existent.</i></p><p>“<i>Sir Uranus is waiting just up ahead.” 
Baroach informed her.</i></p><p>“<i>Why is he down here?” Rei replied 
crossly.</i></p><p>“<i>Hm? You mean you really have to ask? Well, I’m sure that you are 
familiar with the concept of assassination, correct? Unlike Sir Haruka, Sir Uranus is no 
longer a God. He is mortal, just like myself. If he were to die at the hands of the rebels, 
a civil war would surely break out. That’s why, when he is not attending to public matters 
he retreats to this underground hideaway.”</i></p><p>“<i>I see.”</i></p><p>“<i>Please, it 
just this way...”</i></p><p><i>As the dark-haired man led Rei further into the maze, the 
woman thought she glimpsed movement in the cell beside her. Was it a strange reflection of 
the light perhaps? She highly doubted it as there wasn’t much lighting down here to begin 
with. None of the candles lining the walls were lit. Her thoughts drifted back to the 
moments on the cliff and in the Great Hall earlier. There was that same, watchful feeling. 
Vaguely she knew that Baroach was slipping farther away from her, obviously he didn’t appear 
too worried if she got lost, so she decided to overlook it for now but to remain on guard. 
If something should happen, she would deal with it then. </i></p><p><i>It wasn’t too much 
longer before Baroach abruptly halted in front of another door. With one smooth motion, he 
had taken a key out of his armor and unlocked the cell door. The door swung aside with a 
groan of protest, opening the way to what Rei presumed to be her final 
destination.</i></p><p>“<i>If you will...?” He gestured inside.</i></p><p><i>The 
raven-haired woman silently approached the area and waited just between the gate and the 
room. Her amethyst eyes swept across the darkness, but nothing could be clearly made out. As 
far as she was concerned, it was empty.</i></p><p>“<i>Sir Baroach... There seems to have 
been a mistake. It appears that this room is 
empty.”</i></p><p>‘<i>Hmph.’</i></p><p>“…<i>Gotcha.”</i></p><p><i><b>Flash--</b></i></p><p><i>A 
glint of metal flew Rei’s way but she was ready for it. The woman sprung into action and 
unsheathed her sword. She parried the attack and sent the force flying upwards. The sound of 
their clashing blades could be heard echoing all the way down the 
corridor.</i></p><p><i><b>Tzing!</b></i></p><p>“<i>I knew it! HaaaaaaAh!” The Martian swung 
her sword again, forcing him back into a nearby wall. “This was another one of your 
lies!”</i></p><p>“<i>A lie you say? What makes you so sure of that?!” He rolled along the 
wall as the woman’s sword narrowly missed him.</i></p><p>“<i>Don’t give me that! Haruka 
would never allow herself to be kidnapped! You really expected me to believe that her people 
would plan a mutiny? If anyone would betray her, it would be 
you!”</i></p><p><i><b>Crash!</b></i></p><p>“<i>So... you knew all of that, but you still 
decided to come with me anyway? Alone? Maybe the real fool is you!” Baroach grinned back 
despite the assault. Their swords met once more, but Rei became alarmed by the man’s awkward 
movements. For some unknown reason, Baroach was doing everything in his power to avoid 
stepping into one corner of the 
room.</i></p><p>“<i>Raaaaar!”</i></p><p><i><b>Tzing!</b></i></p><p><i><b>Ting!</b></i></p><p><i><b>Crach!</b></i></p><p><i><b>Sssh!</b></i></p><p><i>Rei 
spun around and roundhouse kicked the man in the 
side.</i></p><p><i><b>WHOMP!</b></i></p><p>“<i>GaaaaaaH---!” He bent over to the side of the 
injured area. As soon as the pain hit him, he knew it hadn’t been an ordinary attack-- the 
blow had broken through his armor and directly struck him in the ribs. “P-Pretty good.” He 
clutched his side and wobbled back. “But... I think that’s enough fun for me. You can keep 
going if you want though. That is, if you don’t value the life of your 
servant.”</i></p><p>‘<i>Minako?!’ Rei froze mid-strike and instead, restored the distance 
between them.</i></p><p><i><b>Tup!</b></i></p><p>“<i>That’s right, your precious maid, your 
Majesty. We are holding her and your diplomat comrades captive. So I would strongly suggest 
that you put down your sword and get down to the ‘negotiating’.”</i></p><p><i>Rei stood 
there in silence, listening carefully to everything Baroach was presenting to 
her.</i></p><p><i>Baroach, on the other hand, struggled to read his opponent. The lack of 
light made it nearly impossible for him to see if his words were actually having any effect 
on the Martian Ruler. She was a barbarian after all. All Martians were.</i></p><p>“<i>What 
we want is the Inner Alliance’s cooperation. If you help us to wipe out the rebels, then we 
will return your comrades to you, unharmed.”</i></p><p><i>He was surprised when she started 
to laugh.</i></p><p>“<i>Hahahaha... And you were planning to use WHAT again, to persuade 
me?” Rei suddenly smirked. The man could have sworn that there was madness in that 
intimidating, hard smile. It was enough to wipe the smile away from his. Yet the next thing 
the woman said did a lot more than wipe his smile off his face. It nearly made his heart 
stop.</i></p><p>“<i>This is a joke, right? None of them mean a thing to me. In fact, I find 
it absolutely hilarious that you thought you could bribe me with that useless, nitwit for a 
girl! Don’t you understand that a maid to a Martian, is just another commodity to be bought 
and sold? They are human slaves. Disposable, and can be easily replaced. If you were to kill 
her, then I would just simply just go and get myself another. However... if you are you 
really that keen to watch out for your best interests, I think negotiating with the 
diplomats would be a wiser choice. I’d pay them a ‘visit’ if I were 
you.”</i></p><p>“<i>Wha---” He barely muttered before Rei’s aura surged. He was at a loss 
for words. “Y-You must be bluffing! You mean to tell me that you have no concern for your 
comrades at all?! Then why in the name of Uranus would Mars join an 
alliance?!”</i></p><p>“<i>Hm? You mean you have to ask?” She said, mockingly. “It’s for 
convenience of course! There’s a lot of power involved with these alliances! Isn’t that the 
very reason why you want our help?”</i></p><p><i>Oh no, Baroach wasn’t about to let her get 
the best of him quite yet. There was still one thing that he hadn’t 
tried.</i></p><p>“<i>Heh…I see. So I should have just skipped the barbarian and asked the 
diplomats instead. But since we’re on the subject...since you don’t seem to care for the 
maid, why don’t you allow me to buy her from you? You said it yourself-- if she died, you 
could always get another. But I think killing her would be somewhat of a waste. She has 
quite the body. She could probably reach her full potential by bedding with a man, instead 
of slaving away for you. What’s your price?”</i></p><p>“<i>...”</i></p><p>“<i>Actually, now 
that I think about it, where did you find 
her?”<br></i><i><b><br></b></i><i><b>Vsh!</b></i></p><p>“<i>Huh?” Baroach had barely blinked 
when his opponent vanished from sight. The next thing he knew, an ominous hissing sound 
filled his 
ears.</i></p><p><i><b>SLASH!</b></i></p><p><i><b>SssssSSSH!</b></i></p><p><i>Blood suddenly 
sprayed into the air, followed by an injured howl.</i></p><p>“<i>AAAAAAAAH!” Baroach held 
his injured arm. A long, deep gash ran along from the base of his hand up to his elbow. 
Blood spilt everywhere but he had received his reply. “Ah—ha….hah…hahahaha! So... you do 
care.” He painfully turned around to face the barbarian who dared to injure 
him.</i></p><p>“<i>Say it again,” She said coldly. “…And I’ll kill 
you.”</i></p><p><i><b>DOOOOOM!</b></i></p><p><i>Baroach staggered back into one of the brick 
walls with a victorious smile beaming on his face. Without hesitating he slammed his fist 
against a certain brick and sent it crashing to the floor. Instantly an alarm went off. The 
lights above flashed a menacing red amongst the howling beckon as the series of clanking 
footsteps drew nearer to where they stood.</i></p><p>“<i>You can try and fight them if you 
want, but I would advise against it.”</i></p><p>“<i>Oh?” Rei’s eyes flashed.</i></p><p>“<i>I 
said I was a man of my word, and I am. You wanted to meet our ‘leader’… so there he is!” He 
pointed to a dark corner. Rei felt her eyes widen at the sight. “That’s right. Until you get 
your act together, consider him as company.”</i></p><p><u>(Wind Chamber)</u></p><p>“She’s 
still there. It’s rather unfortunate that it came to this, but until she comes to her senses 
and agrees to our terms… Hm? Oh dear, are you about to cry?”</p><p>“You just left her 
there...?”</p><p>“That’s right. Isn’t that what I just said? I can repeat it for you if you 
want. I left her in a dark, smelly prison cell.”</p><p>“Both Celeste…” Minako could still 
see her and Celeste sitting together, talking about her crush on Soren. She could still see 
the kind-hearted smile on the commander’s face, her sadness, her worries and fears, and her 
last attempt to protect Minako from the intruder. “And 
Rei…?”</p><p><b>…</b><i><b>Ping…</b></i></p><p>“How dare 
you…”</p><p><i><b>Ping!</b></i></p><p><i><b>Ftzz…ftzz..zzz….</b></i></p><p>“Hm?”</p><p><i><b>WoooOOOOOOSH!</b></i></p><p>The 
three remaining soldiers yelped as a blast of hot air kicked up.</p><p>“Yikes! W-What’s 
going on?!” One of them cried. But before he could utter another word, the man’s knees 
buckled under a sudden crushing pressure. “Agh!”</p><p><b>THUD!</b></p><p>“D-Damn 
it!”</p><p>The second soldier launched himself out in front of the man holding the 
projector, making a last stand against the strange force. He too, was quickly disposed 
of.</p><p>“Grrrrr----AHHH!” He slammed into the back far wall and collapsed, 
unconscious.</p><p><b>Thud!</b></p><p>“Sir, w-what should I do?! Should I retreat?!” The 
remaining soldier begged his superior. His entire body quaked with fear. He’d never felt 
another presence quite like it. <i>The air! It’s getting so hot! I-I c-can’t breathe…! 
</i></p><p>Yet Baroach’s projected image remained mute against his subordinate’s pleas. He 
couldn’t believe what he was seeing. In the center of the room the ‘maid’ was radiating some 
abnormal spiritual pressure around her. Even from afar, where his real body stood, he could 
sense its magnitude. The man deeply scowled.</p><p><i>What in the name of Uranus is going on 
here?! How can a mere palace servant possess such power?! </i>His dark blue eyes narrowed in 
thought. As absurd as the predicament was, he knew he had felt this kind of power before. It 
only question was, how could an ordinary human—? The man 
froze.</p><p><i>Unless...!</i></p><p>“Haaaaaaaah!”</p><p><b>Fwoooooo—CRACKLE!</b></p><p>“COMMANDEEEEERR!!!!!” 
The last soldier crumpled to the ground and the device with him. Baroach’s form flickered 
and disappeared just as resistance members stormed into the 
chamber.</p><p><b>Tup!Tup!Tup!Tup!</b></p><p>Soren and a handful of his trusted soldiers 
rounded the corner and balked at what they saw. A strong spiritual pressure disguised as a 
wind current fluctuated wildly within the chamber. With all of its targets already rendered 
helpless, there was nothing left to redirect its wraith at. So instead, it curled like a 
fist and blindly rammed into the side walls. The room shook and shuddered against the 
unnecessary violence. Even the machine at the center of the room, which had withstood strong 
currents for years threatened to collapse. Soren and his followers found themselves staring 
transfixed at the source of it all. The diplomat from Venus stood at the center of the room, 
her hair whipping around wildly and becoming soaked by the nearby splashing waves. She was a 
furious force of nature.</p><p>“Wha—Lady Venus! Please, that’s enough! They’ve all been 
defeated!”</p><p>The wind continued to howl a moment longer before Minako realized that the 
enemy had indeed been defeated. The moment her concentration broke, the pressure died away. 
It had been the only thing supporting her throughout her emotional outburst, so when it 
disappeared she fell to her knees and coughed for air.</p><p><i>Ah! What did I just? </i>Her 
blue eyes appeared unfocused as she tried to catch her breath. <i>What just... happened? 
</i><i>I remember feeling angry and then... something welled up inside. I don’t know what it 
was, but it just kept building up. The more I thought about my friends, how useless I was, 
and then…Rei. I wanted to see her again. I wanted to hold hands with her again. And then, 
she was locked away because of me...?</i></p><p><i>I couldn’t stop myself! It felt like 
something inside just snapped!</i></p><p>“Lady Venus! Are you all right?” Soren was already 
halfway across the room when he spotted Celeste. His eyes widened upon seeing the blood. 
<i>Was I too late? </i>“Celeste! Celeste, can you hear me!” He immediately rushed to her 
side. Within seconds he slid into the water beside her, shaking her motionless body. 
“Celeste!”</p><p>“She took a blow to the back of head. She was trying to protect me...” 
Minako explained quietly. She wanted to go to her friend’s side as well, but she felt 
somewhat ashamed and responsible for this incident. Besides, if Celeste wanted anyone to be 
by her side it would be Soren. “Will she be okay?”</p><p>Soren placed two fingers on 
Celeste’s neck, checking for her pulse and then he checked her breathing. Once that was 
done, he felt at the back of the woman’s head.</p><p>“Yes, I think so,” he finally said. 
“She does seem to have a bit of a bump at the back of her head, but other than that, there 
doesn’t appear to be any serious injury. But I can tell you one thing for sure. It won’t do 
her any good staying in the water,” He then carefully slipped his arms around her slim 
figure and grunted as he lifted her from the pool.</p><p>“Sir!” Another man rushed into the 
room. “Ah—Sir Celeste?! Oh no! What happened? Please Sir, allow me to take over. I can take 
her to first aid wing for you--”</p><p>“No. That is all right, I will handle this 
myself.”</p><p>“But--”</p><p>“Tell the troops that I will be there as soon as I tend to her. 
I expect the wounded to be taken care of and those willing to fight to be mentally prepared 
when I arrive. Do I make myself clear?”</p><p>“S-Sir!” The recruit saluted as the second 
commander past him to the exit.</p><p>“Lady Venus... will you please follow me?” Soren 
quietly requested over his shoulder. “I would like to hear what has happened.”</p><p>“All 
right...”</p><p><b>Tup… tup…tup…</b></p><p><u>(Rei</u> <u>Prison)</u></p><p>In the dark 
prison cell, Rei sighed heavily. A portion of her aura was just returning from the outside 
hallway, bringing with it another headache.</p><p><i>Great...</i> She thought, unconsciously 
making her signature frown. <i>It looks like I’m not the only one who’s stuck here.</i> As 
she thought this, images of her investigation came to mind. As far as she could tell, her 
cell happened to be at the very end of this miserable place. The other cells that lined the 
labyrinth were not here for decoration either. Earlier when she had set foot into the place 
she remembered glimpsing movement—now she was confident that she knew what it 
was.</p><p><i>They’re keeping people prisoners down here, and a lot of them at that! All of 
them seem to have blonde hair and light coloured eyes, but hardly any of them are soldiers. 
They’re all civilians!</i></p><p>Somewhere in another cell a child’s cries could be heard. 
Unknown to Rei, stationed at the front of the cell row was pair of red eyes. The slitted 
eyes turned in the direction of the crying, as if contemplating what to do about the strange 
noise, that was, until it sensed a familiar confrontational presence from earlier before. In 
alarm it leapt into the shadows when a breeze closed in. The crying suddenly 
stopped.</p><p><b>…</b><b>Ping…</b></p><p>Rei turned her head and peered into the darkness. 
Was something there? “Again…” The Martian darkly muttered and shook her head. <i>I don’t 
have time for this.</i> She then turned her attention to her only cell occupant. His dark 
form twitched for a moment, and then shivered almost 
convulsively.</p><p>“…Erm…eh…ah…”</p><p>Rei narrowed her eyes, hardly reacting to his 
strange speech; Baroach had essentially explained it all. Their interesting conversation was 
still clear as day in the Martian’s mind.</p><p><b>…</b></p><p>“<i>Uranus? He’s in here?” 
Rei spun in her cell, eyes wide in apprehension. “You’d lock your leader in a prison cell? 
That’s hardly what I’d call ‘in hiding’.”</i></p><p>“<i>Hmm… yes, well you see that first 
transmission title was actually… CORRECT.” Baroach grinned. He spoke more boldly now that 
his wound had been attended to.</i></p><p>“<i>A figurehead.” It suddenly made sense. Why 
didn’t she think of it earlier? “You used his reputation and popularity to gain support from 
his former subjects. Uranus was never in charge was he? You were!”</i></p><p>“<i>Very good. 
You now have it all figured out. That’s pretty impressive.”</i></p><p>“<i>Do your ‘people’ 
know about this?” Rei growled.</i></p><p>“<i>No.”Baroach had to chuckle at that. “Many of 
them still believe that Sir Uranus is giving them their orders through me. It is rather 
convenient, though rapidly becoming unnecessary. The old man is quickly outgrowing his 
usefulness. He’s going to die soon. And once he does, all we have to do is show his body to 
the people and claim that the resistance has murdered our beloved leader. That will leave 
me, the second in command, uncontested for the position. After all, who would be better 
qualified? Hah, look at it this way Mars—I’ll inherit the throne legally!” He once again 
laughed.</i></p><p>“<i>You damn backstabbing--”</i></p><p><i>But Baroach was no longer 
intimidated by the Martian’s growing rage. There was a set of bars separating them, and he 
had a tight grip on the fate of her comrades.</i></p><p>“<i>I wouldn’t finish that if I were 
you. After all, once the alliance negotiation is settled you’ll be working for 
me.”</i></p><p>“<i>I’d rather…”</i></p><p>“<i>Die first? That’s quite noble of you your 
Majesty, but let me tell you something. Between us, being noble only gets you so far. You’d 
do well to remember that.” There was a bitter tone in his voice as he said this. “Why don’t 
you ask what happens to people who defy us for too long, hm?”</i></p><p>“<i>What are you 
talking about?”</i></p><p>“<i>When I said that Uranus was here, I meant that he’s in YOUR 
cell! Haven’t you sensed him yet?”</i></p><p>“<i>!” ‘What…?’ Rei slowly turned when a slight 
throbbing in her head started up.</i></p><p><b>…</b><i><b>ping…</b></i></p><p><i>She caught 
sight of the form and recoiled back in shock. The man before her was not what she had 
expected at all. She had known that he was mortal now and was alive through their 
investigation, but the state he was currently in-how could one really consider him 
‘alive’?</i></p><p><i>His blonde hair appeared unkempt-- it had grown very long, and in some 
places there were balding patches where it started to fall out. Further down, his once fair 
face was marred with wrinkles and sullen cheeks whereas the rest of his figure was 
dangerously thin. However, Rei feared more for the man’s mental health. There were dark bags 
under his eyes. Uranus’s eyes were sullen and hollow, taking on a distant, glazed 
appearance. What little speech that left his lips were ramblings of unknown conversations 
that no one knew of. And his smile (?), it was twisted and borderline insanity. The trail of 
drool falling down one side of his face existed as another compelling reason to believe in 
that argument.</i></p><p>“<i>He refused to tell us where his heir had run off to. Someone 
heard she had made a visit before her disappearance and well, we were forced to torture 
him.”</i></p><p><i>The comment enraged her. “How are you so sure that he knew where Haruka 
went?! For all you know, it could have been a simple visit.”</i></p><p>‘<i>Haruka would 
never have spared him so he could experience this!’ Rei thought angrily.</i></p><p>“<i>Well, 
I guess when you put it that way, we don’t. But if he did know, he would have surely told us 
by now. Isn’t that right Sir Uranus?” Baroach addressed the man. The former Uranus twitched 
and began to mumble again between coughing fits of laughter. “At any rate, it appears that 
you require more time to think about your decision. Please remember that your comrades are 
depending on you. I’d give it some careful thought.” He turned to leave. “Oh, but there’s no 
need to worry… we will not torture you like we did with HIM. You’re still useful as you 
are.”</i></p><p>“<i>Why you…!”</i></p><p><b>…</b></p><p>“…Hehe… young heir, will beat Ares… 
for sure haha! War…must schedule next war soon…”</p><p>“…”</p><p><i>What did Haruka tell 
him? Is it possible that he really knows where she went? </i>It was a long shot, but Rei 
decided to take it. She had already gone through enough trouble as it was to find him 
(though she did feel some pity for him in his current condition).</p><p>“Sir Uranus? Where 
is Haruka? Do you know where Haruka went?”</p><p>“H-Haruka…” A strange light flickered in 
his dead eyes, giving Rei some hope.</p><p><i>Wait. He responded to her name? 
</i></p><p>“Yes, Haruka. Your heir.”</p><p>“Haruka… heir…” His speech became clearer for a 
moment.</p><p>It suddenly occurred to Rei.</p><p><i>What if the people who tortured him 
didn’t know Haruka’s name? What if they only referred to her as Sir Uranus or Ruler of 
Uranus? Is it possible that they weren’t asking the right question?</i></p><p>“Do you know 
where Haruka went?” Rei repeated with forced patience. She was taken by surprise when the 
man suddenly burst out into laughter.</p><p>“HAHAHAHAHA! Yes Haruka, go do that.” He 
bellowed. “Neptune is a perfect place to conquer! Ahahaha! A weak ruler, perfect and 
easy.”</p><p>“She went to Neptune? Are you sure?”</p><p>“Neptune!” He snorted. The rest of 
his speech died down to random incoherent mutterings once more.</p><p><i>So Haruka has gone 
to Neptune? </i>Rei pondered. <i>But to conquer it...? No, I seriously doubt it. She would 
never do that. If there was one reason that she would go there, it would be for the same 
reason that she spared this man’s life. Still...it doesn’t explain what happened to Michiru. 
The report was that they both disappeared around the same time. Could it be that something 
happened on Neptune and Haruka went to investigate?</i></p><p>Rei finally stood up, but her 
eyes never left the delirious man. His words sounded strange and empty for some reason, but 
it couldn’t mean anything right? For a moment she continued to watch him, silently 
contemplating her own course of action. If she wished to, she could escape right now. There 
was no doubt in her mind that she could. However, regardless of what she chose to do, she 
still left with a decision of what to do with Uranus. He was clearly out of his mind and 
incapable of thinking rationally, his body had already deteriorated greatly. If she left him 
here, there was the off-chance that Baroach’s minions would return and continue to 
mercilessly interrogation.</p><p><i>I guess there’s no other choice…</i> Rei slowly drew her 
sword.</p><p>“Listen up Sir Uranus. Haruka… never spared you so you could live like this. 
She never wanted this.” Rei began.</p><p>Again Uranus’s eyes flickered strangely. 
<i>Haruka…</i> His mind was trying to recall something. As he struggled, both strange and 
familiar voices reached him.</p><p><b>…</b></p><p>“<i>Hey, old man! This time, I will beat 
you!”</i></p><p>“<i>Haha, do you think so? You have yet to beat me. What makes you think 
this time will be any different?”</i></p><p>“<i>Because--!!!”</i></p><p>“<i>Then come 
Haruka! Let us see what you have learnt!”</i></p><p><b>…</b></p><p><b>Ping!</b></p><p>The 
Martian’s head shot up at the noise. The familiar coldness that had haunted them all day had 
returned and with vengeance. It was stronger than before and was so very 
close.</p><p>Immediately Rei let loose her aura and searched for it. This time, she resolved 
that was going to find it.</p><p><i>The shadows! </i>The woman felt like the darkness was 
closing in all around them.</p><p>“Show yourself!” She cried. The raven-haired warrior was 
so concentrated in this presence that she allowed herself to become blind to the approaching 
wind.</p><p>Meanwhile Uranus’s body began to convulse again, stronger than Rei had ever 
seen. Although the woman had no clue of what was happening (and neither did Uranus himself), 
his body seemed to remember.</p><p><i>Haruka… </i>Again Uranus’s mind tried to retrieve 
something very important. It had been recent. Something very important to the former God; it 
were as if he had left a piece of his true self back there. Could it be that because his 
body sensed the impending danger that he worked so hard to retrieve it now?</p><p>“Fine. If 
that’s the way you want to play it, then I’ll just have to force you out!” Rei boosted her 
power. The shadows were quickly disappearing in the presence of its 
light.</p><p>“<i>Haruka?” </i>Uranus heard his voice ask. That was it. What was so 
important, he finally remembered. It was the last time that he had spoken to his successor; 
he had been watching the sunrise on the lower lands when she had approached 
him.</p><p><b>…</b></p><p>“<i>Haruka? What are you doing here?” He inquired the woman. She 
had come without her battle armor, just like the last time they had fought. The mere memory 
rekindled a twinge of resentment that he used to harbour for her, yet it hadn’t been as 
strong as it was back then. No, for the warmth of the sunset was enough to melt the ill 
feeling away.</i></p><p>“<i>You’re still angry, aren’t you?” It really wasn’t a 
question.</i></p><p><i><b>Woooooosh…</b></i></p><p><i>A cool, gentle breeze flew 
by.</i></p><p>“<i>No.” The man finally replied. “Rather perhaps, I think I should be 
grateful.”</i></p><p>“<i>Grateful?” Haruka arched an eyebrow. It was the last thing she had 
expected to hear from him.</i></p><p>“<i>I hate to admit it, but you were right. Because 
I’ve always lived as a God…I never truly realized what life was about. I had come to believe 
that pleasure was the only thing worth pursuing in life, whether it was for the battles or 
the materialistic trophies. But even long before I adopted you, I came to realize that 
neither really made me happy. There was always this restlessness that I felt inside, and it 
continued to eat away at me. Perhaps Ares felt the same way, I cannot really say. But...even 
though I was unhappy, I never bothered to change my ways because I just assumed that I had 
all the time in the world to figure it out. You changed all of that, Haruka. After I was 
stripped of my immortality, I finally saw that it’s the simplest things that life that are 
the most precious.” He allowed his gaze to fall back at the sunset. “I doubt that’s why 
you’re here though. Why did you come to visit me?”</i></p><p><i>A slight pause 
followed.</i></p><p>“<i>I’m going to Neptune.” She finally answered. The former Uranus 
quickly turned his head in her direction. “I don’t know when I’ll be back, 
so…”</i></p><p>“<i>...You wish to ask about Apollo.”</i></p><p>“<i>Heh. I see that your 
senses haven’t dulled a bit.” ‘But that wasn’t the real reason I came…’ Haruka silently 
thought.</i></p><p>“<i>Then listen carefully Haruka…he is not a mere legend that exists to 
frighten naughty children. He existed and, the original Gods and Goddesses who ruled the 
planets such as myself were the ones responsible for overthrowing him.”</i></p><p>“<i>Why? 
What happened?”</i></p><p>“<i>We grew tired of his tyranny. So we fought along-side each 
other during the ‘Battle against the Sun’. Mercury… Mars… Jupiter… Neptune… myself… and even 
Venus Aphrodite… Together we overthrew the ruler of the Gods. However, it appears that even 
in death his spirit is seeking revenge. Hmph. Although I no longer possess the power of a 
God, I have yet to become senile. He is coming for us…the original rulers who took his life. 
Already Mercury, Jupiter and Neptune have met their fate. ”</i></p><p>“<i>But you’re no 
longer a God!” Haruka protested, understanding what he was implying.</i></p><p>“<i>It does 
not matter. I have lived a long life… perhaps, too long.” The man cast a longing look 
towards the warm sunset. He did not know how many more he would get to see, if only he had 
appreciated this sort of thing more when he had the chance. “I do not know why you are going 
to Neptune, Haruka. However, it is your choice. You are the ruler now. And…you are the wind. 
You are free do whatever and go wherever you please. But if you should ever remember 
something from this old fool… never take things for granted. Never let power and immortality 
corrupt you. ”</i></p><p>“<i>I understand. Thank you for the advice.” The woman gave one 
last look at the sunset and turned to go. “But I will return again…and you better be here 
when I do! So, until then…stay 
well.”</i></p><p><b>…</b></p><p>“Good-bye…Haruk—AH!”</p><p><i><b>STAB----SPLOOSH!</b></i></p><p>Rei 
spun towards the man upon hearing his cry.</p><p>“What the--?!”</p><p>Her power had now lit 
up the entire cell, displaying everything in clear sight. Yet she wasn’t prepared for what 
she was about to see. There was a small glint of metal protruding from his front where his 
heart was positioned-- blood was gushing out uncontrollably in her general direction, 
splattering all over the floor and walls. Rei inwardly cringed when the dead man’s body 
shuddered one last time as the blade was withdrawn, and snarled as his murderer was revealed 
at last as his corpse collapsed to the stone floor. Behind the man there stood a shadow. 
From what Rei could see, it had the shape of a child and possessed the red eyes of a 
demon.</p><p>Emotionlessly it retracted its blade. In one swift motion it then swung the 
stained metal towards a nearby wall and ‘cleaned’ its weapon of the evidence.</p><p>“So it 
was you.” Rei felt the hairs on the back of her neck rise. “You were the one stalking us all 
this time!”</p><p>Yet the creature took no notice of her. It seemed rather uninterested in 
the woman.</p><p>“Don’t ignore me!” Rei roared, and rushed 
it.</p><p><b>Tup!Tup!Tup!Tup!Tup!</b></p><p>With her sword posed she swung down against the 
intruder...</p><p>“HAAAAAH!”</p><p>…only to see her weapon fall through it!</p><p><i>What…? 
No! It’s impossible!</i></p><p>The shadow, who hadn’t moved once during the Martian’s 
attack, now turned to face the soldier. From the narrowing of its crimson eyes one could see 
that it was having an apparent a change of heart. It lifted its weapon and began to step 
towards its new opponent with its intent perfectly clear.</p><p>“Damn…!” <i>What do I do 
now? Physical attacks don’t work on this 
thing!</i></p><p><b>Wooooooooosh…</b></p><p><i>Wind…? </i>A breeze suddenly kicked up 
violently within the cell. It spun and twisted, instantly shooting out and, this time, 
successfully capturing its prey off-guard. The monster struggled and squirmed, desperately 
fighting for freedom, yet freedom appeared to be out of its grasp this time. As if someone 
had silently commanded it, the wind crunched down with an iron fist and exterminated the 
shadow-being. Its black form glowed momentarily before it turned into a ball of light. The 
sphere then immediately dashed through the nearest cell wall and disappeared.</p><p><i>This 
wind… The presence in it feels so familiar! Ah!</i></p><p>“Haruka?!” Rei shouted. The name 
had barely left her lips when a loud rumbling took a hold of the 
area.</p><p><b>Rmm…rmm….rmm!</b></p><p>“Great! W-What now?”</p><p><b>KABOOM!</b></p><p>Rei 
dove to the side as cement and debris was sent flying everywhere. Behind her where a solid, 
impenetrable wall once stood was a large gaping hole. As a result, bright sunlight from 
outside immediately that flooded into the dark prison. Many people squinted back in 
pain.</p><p><i>What was that just now?! </i></p><p>The prisoners around the Martian leader 
became bold enough to mutter to one another. Was it another attack? Though there were many 
startled faces, they all soon lit up with joy at the sight of one in 
particular.</p><p>“Look!” Someone cried.</p><p>Rei squinted at the newly created 
entranceway, her eyes nearly adjusted to the light. What she saw almost made her heart skip 
a beat; there stood a short-haired blonde, with blazing green eyes.</p><p><i>Haruka...? No, 
wait. It’s not Haruka! </i>Rei realized. <i>But then, who is she?</i></p><p>“This is it! 
Today we will take back what is ours!” The woman called to her people. “Those who can fight, 
come with me. The rest of you, ill, weak, wounded, too young or elderly, our troops will 
move you to a safe location until the battle is over.”</p><p>“And you are?” Rei 
questioned.</p><p>“Hm?” The woman finally took notice of the Martian, and gave her a long, 
hard stare. For a moment it appeared that she was drawing a blank, but then her eyes 
suddenly lit up in recognition. “Say… you wouldn’t happen to be the leader of Mars, would 
you?”</p><p>“What’s it to you?”</p><p>“Nice to meet you! From here on out, we’ll be working 
together.”</p><p>“W-Working together?” Rei sputtered. She barely noticed that the other 
prisoners around her were already being escorted to their new destination. The blonde woman 
began to walk back towards the entrance, but Rei wasn’t about to let her walk off just like 
that. “You just come barging in here and--and I don’t even know who you are!”</p><p>“Kali 
Auranos, third ranked commander under Uranus Haruka. Or if it’s easier for you to remember, 
you can refer to me as a commanding officer of the ‘insurgent’ army. Anything is fine, as 
long as it’s not short.”</p><p>“This is…” <i>Unbelievable…! How can she be joking around at 
a time like this? It’s exactly something-- that Haruka would do...</i></p><p>“To put it 
simply, I received word from the second commander that our group has established a pack with 
the Inner Alliance. Apparently it was agreed through the consent of a diplomat of Venus. My 
sources told me that she goes by the name of Minako, and that she is currently in the care 
of our other squad. Does her name sound familiar to you, Sir Mars?”</p><p><i>Minako… so 
she’s safe! </i>Rei couldn’t describe how relieved she was.</p><p>“Yes. She is indeed a 
diplomat of Venus and was accompanying us.”</p><p>“I see. Then I suppose there’s only one 
more question that I would like to ask you. Since it was one of your fellow comrades who 
agreed to this deal, and not yourself, do you have any particular problem with this 
arrangement?”</p><p>Rei took a deep breath. This was all going by her so fast. She had so 
many questions, but they weren’t going to get answered if she just stood there. She needed 
to concentrate at the task at hand.</p><p>“No.” She replied in a formal tone. “If Venus 
consented to it, then I will honour the agreement. I have faith in all of my comrades’ 
judgement. Welcome to the Inner Alliance.”</p><p>Kali smiled. “Great! I’ll fill you in on 
everything along the way. Oh, and I hope you’re up for a fight because there’s going to be a 
lot of it.” She cheerfully added.</p><p><i>Oh I’m more than ready for a fight. I have a 
score to settle!</i> Rei nodded, and followed the third commander’s lead.</p>
