<h1>Happy Birthday Hotaru</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/anonymous.html">Anonymous</a><br> </h2>
<pre>        The music was playing softly and there were two shadowed bodies 
sitting by the fireplace.  The two bodies just sat there holding one 
another.  One of the bodies had it&#39;s hair up in buns, while the other had 
it&#39;s hair down.  It looked around shoulder length.

        (Where is this place?  I&#39;ve never seen this place before.  Does this 
mean that something different is going to happen?)

        Suddenly the music stopped and a loud and horrible laughter begun.  
Then, without warning, the person with shoulder length hair began to glow.  
As the person glowed, it also began to shrink.  The laughter just kept 
getting louder and louder as the person just kept getting smaller and 
smaller.  Soon the person disappeared and then the laughter stopped.  The 
room then vanished and the person with their hair in buns was all alone in 
darkness.

        &quot;Hotaru!,&quot; the person screamed, &quot;Don&#39;t leave me!  Hotaru!&quot;

        (Hotaru!  NO!!!  Come back!  Hotaru!  I need you here with me!)

        &quot;Hotaru!  I&#39;m scared!  Please come back and help me!

        (Hotaru, I miss you.)

        &quot;Hotaru, I... love you.&quot;

        ChibiUsa then snapped up panting and sweating.  Her heart was 
racing.  It had been the same reoccurring dream or nightmare as she called 
it, the only difference this time, was the room.  She sat there alone in the 
dark for the rest of the night, afraid that if she fell back to sleep, she 
would have the nightmare again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        The following morning was like any other, Usagi&#39;s alarm clock was 
blasting and the rays of sunlight were beaming down on her face through the 
blinds.  The aroma of a freshly cooked breakfast was quickly filling the air. 
  Sitting at the dinner table, ChibiUsa wasn&#39;t in too happy of a mood.  The 
nightmare kept her up all night and Ikuko has started to notice.

        &quot;Is that nightmare getting at you, hon?&quot;

        &quot;Huh?  Oh, yeah.&quot;

        &quot;You care to tell me about it?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;d rather not.  There&#39;s someone else that I need to talk to it 
about.&quot;

        &quot;Ok but just be sure to talk to someone about it.&quot;

        &quot;I will.  Thank you.&quot;

        After this ChibiUsa finished her breakfast and readied herself for 
school.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        &quot;Hotaru, wait up!&quot; ChibiUsa called out in the hallway.

        Hotaru turned around with a smile, greeting ChibiUsa.  ChibiUsa 
couldn&#39;t help but to notice Hotaru.  The young girl was wearing a black 
baby doll size tank and a short pair of jean shorts that end at half thigh.  
ChibiUsa caught herself and stopped before Hotaru noticed.

        &quot;ChibiUsa!  My birthday is in a week.  I hope you&#39;ll come over and 
spend some time with me.  You can come over and have supper with us.&quot;

        &quot;Of course I will.  I wouldn&#39;t turn down an offer to spend time with 
you, silly.&quot;

        Hotaru just smiled with joy.  She was so happy that her only real 
friend was going to be with her on her birthday.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        ChibiUsa spent the rest of the day trying to decide how she could 
tell Hotaru about her dream and how she felt.  Then she decided, she would 
tell her on her birthday.

        &#39;Do I want to do anything or do I just want to ignore my feelings?  
How could I even begin to tell her how I feel?  I want to do something 
special for her birthday but what?&#39;

        By the end of the day ChibiUsa had done more serious thinking in 
that one day than she ever has in her whole life.  Finally she decided that 
she would take Hotaru on a picnic and tell her everything.  She still needed 
some time to plan out all the other details.

        The next day ChibiUsa spent most of the day dreaming about what she 
would say to Hotaru.  She not only thought about what she would say but 
imagined all of the possible responses.  She liked some better than others.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Slowly the days passed by and Hotaru&#39;s birthday was now only a day 
away.  ChibiUsa started to get her things together so that she could spend 
the next day with her best friend.  She had never been more nervous nor 
excited in her life.

        That night ChibiUsa couldn&#39;t sleep.  Not because of the nightmare 
but because of her excitement.  She couldn&#39;t wait to tell Hotaru how she 
felt.  She prayed that Hotaru would tell her that she felt the same way 
about her.  The night hours slowly dragged on and ChibiUsa fell asleep and 
dreamt.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        It was a warm evening and the sun was beginning to set.  Two shadowed 
figures sat on the grass and had their backs against a tree.  You could 
easily tell that the two shadowed figures were both female from curves of 
their bodies.  One leaned over to the other and gave her a soft kiss on the 
lips.  As they parted it became clear who they were.  Both had their hair 
down.  One was Hotaru, the other was ChibiUsa.  Hotaru smiled and blushed 
then slowly she leaned over to ChibiUsa and began to kiss her softly and 
held her in her arms.  As the kiss went on Hotaru slipped ChibiUsa her 
tongue.  Shocked and caught off guard by this, ChibiUsa let out a soft moan. 
  When the kiss ended they both smiled and blushed.  ChibiUsa took hold of 
Hotaru and guided her to the ground and ran her hands over her body.  
ChibiUsa, then, went to lie down beside her laying her head on Hotaru&#39;s 
chest and placing her hand on Hotaru&#39;s breast.  ChibiUsa started to tease 
her a little.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        The alarm clock started buzzing and ChibiUsa woke up, annoyed that 
it was only a dream.

        &#39;If only it had been real.&#39; she thought to herself.  When she got 
out of bed she noticed a stain on the sheets and looked down to see that she 
was wet.  Upon noticing this she smiled and wondered how Hotaru would react.

        &quot;Today&#39;s the day.  I gotta make this work.  I just have to.&quot;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        It started out like any normal Friday.  There was no School that day 
because of Teacher planning.  ChibiUsa finished wrapping the gift that she 
had gotten Hotaru.

        It was around noon when ChibiUsa went over to Hotaru&#39;s house.  She 
was set to be there for the day and night if Hotaru didn&#39;t turn her away.  
She wasn&#39;t sure how she was gonna get Haruka and Michiru to leave them alone 
long enough for her to do what she wanted.  She thought hard about what she 
could do while she walked to Hotaru&#39;s house.  When she got there sure 
enough, Michiru answered the door.  Haruka wasn&#39;t there though.

        &quot;Michiru, where is Haruka at?&quot; ChibiUsa inquired.

        &quot;She is out getting some things for Hotaru&#39;s party.  Some last 
minute pick up&#39;s.  Why do you ask?&quot;

        &quot;No reason, I was just wondering.  I figured that you two would have 
started something by now.&quot;

        &quot;No not yet.  We have something special planned for her so we want 
to have everything perfect.&quot;

        &quot;Really?  I have something special planned for her too.  If you 
wouldn&#39;t mind I would like to do it with her alone.  It&#39;s kind of 
embarrassing for me so...&quot;

        &quot;I understand.  I&#39;ll talk to Haruka about it but I&#39;m sure we can do 
that for you.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you.&quot; ChibiUsa said and smiled.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Michiru and Haruka were setting things up and told ChibiUsa that she 
and Hotaru could go off and do whatever while they worked on the 
decorations.  ChibiUsa saw this as the perfect time to make her move.

        &quot;Hotaru, I know of a really nice place in the park, lets go there.  
I have a couple of things that I want to give you.&quot;

        ChibiUsa had her backpack with her and had a few things with her.  
She led Hotaru to a secluded place in the woods beside the park.

        &quot;This place is really beautiful ChibiUsa.  Thank you for bringing me 
here.&quot;

        &quot;Hotaru I want to go ahead and give you my gifts.&quot;

        Hotaru nodded and ChibiUsa opened her bag and pulled out a small 
package and a larger package.  Hotaru opened the smaller package first.  It 
was a cd that was imported from America.  It was a group called Savage 
Garden.  This was their fave. American band.  Next she opened the larger 
package.  It was a big teddy bear.  It looked just like her old bear.  She 
would still have it if the school bullies hadn&#39;t messed it up.

        &quot;Thank you ChibiUsa!&quot; Hotaru said, beaming with joy.  She then gave 
ChibiUsa a big long hug.  ChibiUsa took this opportunity and as Hotaru 
loosened the hug she turned her face to where they were face to face and 
ChibiUsa gave her a quick peck on the lips.  ChibiUsa was red with 
embarrassment.  Hotaru just sat there motionless and speechless.  She 
couldn&#39;t believe what ChibiUsa had just done.

        Hotaru stood there confused and silent.  Not knowing what to do she 
ran home.  ChibiUsa knew that she had messed up, she knew that the next move 
would be up to Hotaru.  She was afraid that she had just ruined their 
friendship.  When Hotaru got home Haruka and Michiru were waiting for her 
and ChibiUsa.

        &quot;Where&#39;s ChibiUsa?&quot; Michiru inquired.

        &quot;Something came up and she had to go.&quot;  Hotaru couldn&#39;t tell them 
what had really happened.  As the day went on Hotaru couldn&#39;t think about 
anything besides what ChibiUsa had done.  As days passed all Hotaru could 
think about was did she do the right thing.  She thought it over and 
wondered.  She had battles between her feelings and what her brain thought.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        One afternoon ChibiUsa had come by and knocked on the door.  Michiru 
answered and asked her to come in.

        &quot;That&#39;s ok, Michiru, I just came by to drop these off for Hotaru.  
They are her birthday presents from me.  I&#39;ve been really busy lately and 
haven&#39;t had time to drop them off.  Tell her I said hi, ok?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll do that.  Bye-bye ChibiUsa.&quot;

        Hotaru was standing around the corner and had heard everything.  She 
knew that ChibiUsa had to have strong feelings for her then.  That night all 
Hotaru could do was think.  She had to do something and it had to be soon.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        The next morning before school she wrote ChibiUsa a note and dropped 
it off in her locker.  When ChibiUsa went to get her first period book she 
saw the note and read it.

        &#39;The woods by the park?  At 6?&#39; she wondered to herself.  All 
ChibiUsa could think about for the rest of the day was what Hotaru had in 
mind.

        The day passed and 6:00 arrived pretty quickly.  ChibiUsa ran to the 
spot that Hotaru and mentioned in the note as fast as she could.  When she 
got there she saw that Hotaru had a battery powered radio and she had the cd 
playing that she had given Hotaru for her birthday.

        &quot;ChibiUsa,&quot; Hotaru started, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I ran off.  I didn&#39;t know 
what to do and I had to think things through.  You had caught me off guard 
and I didn&#39;t expect that.  What I&#39;m trying to say is, I&#39;m sorry.  Can you 
forgive me.  I want you to love me and I want to love you.&quot;  With that said 
Hotaru started to cry.  ChibiUsa ran up to her and hugged her.

        &quot;Of course I can forgive you.  I want to love you and have you love 
me too.&quot;  Hotaru looked ChibiUsa straight in the eyes.  Their faces grew 
closer and closer to each other&#39;s and they kissed. Their tongues exploring 
the other&#39;s mouth.  They stayed this way for a while.  When the kiss broke, 
Hotaru said, &quot;I love you ChibiUsa and I want you to go out with me.&quot;  
ChibiUsa looked at Hotaru, smiled and nodded.
