<h1>Inner Crisis, Outer Conflict (part 5 of 9)</h1>

<a href="../smoon/innerouter-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Setsuna and Michiru stood in the park, feeling the breeze on their 
faces. The wind whipped the water into whitecaps, which shone in the 
bright moonlight. 

&quot;There is a storm brewing.&quot; Michiru said. 

&quot;It&#39;s an old storm, and has been coming for a long time.&quot; Setsuna 
agreed. She lifted her hand, clasping a pen. &quot;Pluto planet power make 
up!&quot; she yelled into the night sky. 

&quot;Neptune planet power make up!&quot; Michiru echoed. 

The wind picked up, blowing steadily as the two Senshi stood there, 
looking up into the sky. Sailor Pluto grasped her staff with one hand 
and held Sailor Neptune&#39;s arm with the other. 

&quot;Are you ready?&quot; she asked. Neptune nodded. She put both her hands on 
Pluto&#39;s staff and Pluto grasped it in both of her own. The wind rose, 
lifting their hair, and energy poured forth from their hands into the 
staff. 

&quot;Where should we begin?&quot; Pluto yelled over the rising wind. 

&quot;Silver Millenium!&quot; Neptune answered. &quot;That&#39;s where all this began!&quot; 
Pluto nodded and they closed their eyes. Slowly they faded from sight, 
leaving only the waves increasing in intensity and trees bending in 
the wind. 

********** 

&quot;Where&#39;s Titania?&quot; Uranus demanded. &quot;I need her here now.&quot; She was 
exhausted, having just fought off a race of creatures who looked to 
Silver Millenium as a new source of energy. She stood, leaning, her 
hands on her thighs, while Oberon, Miranda and Ariel tended to her 
wounds. 

None of her assistants said a word and Uranus looked up. &quot;Is she gone? 
Oberon, where is she?&quot; Oberon stopped bandaging her arm, but said 
nothing. His lips tightened. Uranus looked him in the eye. 

&quot;Oberon?&quot; 

He looked away. &quot;She is different. She doesn&#39;t want to be with me any 
more. She&#39;s...she doesn&#39;t talk to me anymore.&quot; He turned his eyes back 
to the bandage. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Uranus said quickly, but her thoughts were elsewhere. She 
felt her unease grow. When her wounds had healed, she set out to find 
Titania. She searched her planet, but could find no sign of her. 
Setting out for the moons, she came to Titania&#39;s own. There she could 
feel dread build in her. But she still could not find any sign of her 
lieutenant. Frustrated, Uranus returned to her planet. But she did not 
stop looking for Titania. 

One day, while watching the sky, Uranus felt a wrenching pain move 
through her. She coughed and fell to her knees. As her hands touched 
her planet, she could feel its pain piercing through her. She 
screamed, searing agony slicing through her body. 

Controlling herself, she got to her feet and turned. The pain led her 
onwards, pulling her towards a valley. Fogs and mists swirled around 
her, she stumbled as another wave of pain arced through her body. 

Looking through the haze, Uranus could make out an edifice before her. 
She turned towards it, lurching as new distress shot through her. 
Before she reached the tower a figure could be seen through the 
clouds. The figure approached and resolved into a person. 

Titania sneered at her, gesturing disdainfully, as Uranus crashed to 
the ground in front of her. </pre>
