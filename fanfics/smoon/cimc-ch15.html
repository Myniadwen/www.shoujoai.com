<h1>Come into My Chamber (part 15 of 15)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/cimc-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>&quot;We&#39;re going to die.&quot; 

&quot;Shut up.&quot; 

&quot;But...we are! Come on, Hino, it&#39;s insane! They&#39;ll kill us!&quot; 

Rei rolled her eyes and swallowed down a couple of painkillers. &quot;They 
won&#39;t kill us.&quot; 

&quot;They will too.&quot; 

&quot;Will not.&quot; 

&quot;Will too.&quot; 

&quot;Will not.&quot; 

&quot;Will too.&quot; 

&quot;Will...listen, I&#39;m not doing this. It&#39;s stupid.&quot; 

&quot;Fighting a bunch of super-powered, undead legions is stupid too, but 
you&#39;re doing that,&quot; Mitsuki muttered irritably. 

&quot;You can go home if you want to.&quot; 

&quot;No way! First of all, Kazuki is going to find me and kill me if I don&#39;t 
come...&quot; 

Rei shook her head. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen anyone so afraid of their boss...&quot; 

&quot;...and secondly,&quot; Mitsuki continued, ignoring her, &quot;if I don&#39;t come and 
help, you&#39;re probably going to die, and I don&#39;t want that on my 
conscience.&quot; 

&quot;Right.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m serious. Look at you. You&#39;re tired, and you&#39;ve been eating those 
painkillers like they&#39;re candy. If one of those...whatever they are gets 
a hold of you, you&#39;re out for the count. No pun intended.&quot; 

&quot;Ugh...it was still a pretty bad pun though...and I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; 

&quot;Why are you going, anyway?&quot; 

&quot;Because, it&#39;s my job.&quot; 

&quot;But...they&#39;re out of your area. And besides, wouldn&#39;t it be easier to 
have a lot of people sent down here?&quot; 

&quot;Who&#39;s going to believe me when I say that I&#39;ve seen vampires?&quot; 

Mitsuki slumped, leaned her head against the cool glass of the car 
window. &quot;I guess you&#39;re right...but it seems unnecessarily dangerous. 
You might die.&quot; 

&quot;I might.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t you care? I mean, they&#39;re not all that bad...if Kazuki wanted to, 
she would have you know, killed me a while ago...&quot; 

&quot;Listen, they have killed people.&quot; 

&quot;But...&quot; Mitsuki shrugged, closed her eyes. &quot;Whatever.&quot; 

Neither of them spoke for the rest of the ride. 

------------------- 

&quot;I know you know something,&quot; Demando began carefully. &quot;I&#39;ve tried to be 
fair...&quot; 

&quot;By kidnapping us?&quot; Setsuna asked evenly. Demando raked his fingers 
through his hair. Always difficult. Why was her clan so difficult? 

Women, he thought to himself. Out loud, he said, &quot;Serenity has 
been...distant.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;d be distant too, if I was torn away from my home.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m sure your mate can attest to that,&quot; Demando snapped. He was feeling 
especially annoyed. &quot;You took her away from her home, and you hadn&#39;t 
even--&quot; 

&quot;She has nothing to do with this,&quot; Setsuna said, her voice rising. She 
gained her composure and smoothed out wrinkles in her coat. &quot;Eventually, 
she warmed to me.&quot; 

&quot;When she realized she had nothing left, yes. How...selfish of you.&quot; 

&quot;For several millennia,&quot; Setsuna began, and now she sounded tired, and 
old, &quot;I have searched for one suitable to me. I am an ancient, I have 
fought the hunters, I deserve this.&quot; 

&quot;Does she?&quot; 

Setsuna slumped her shoulders, pulled her knees to her chest. &quot;No. She 
grew into it...better than Serenity did, though. She has her humanity, 
but it is...too far locked away, too long gone. Serenity will never lose 
her humanity, her empathy. This isn&#39;t the...way, her path.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s nobody&#39;s path, Setsuna,&quot; Demando said calmly. He gazed out the 
window. &quot;It was not my path, nor yours. But, she has to make the best of 
it.&quot; 

&quot;You...&quot; she sighed wearily. &quot;You have to let her choose...&quot; 

&quot;Choose what?&quot; 

&quot;Where she wants to go. You owe her...that much.&quot; 

&quot;And you, Setsuna?&quot; 

&quot;I will...if she wishes it, I will release Kazuki. I&#39;ll ask. But you...&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll do what I wish.&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;ll never love you.&quot; 

&quot;Is that so? Why?&quot; 

Setsuna paused, looked down at her hands. Demando frowned. 

&quot;You know something, don&#39;t you?&quot; He went closer, moved his fingers 
beneath her chin and lifted her head. &quot;Tell me.&quot; 

&quot;I am not at liberty to divulge--&quot; Before she finished, Demando made a 
disgusted noise. 

&quot;You know, I have you hostage.&quot; Setsuna gritted her teeth. 

&quot;I&#39;m well aware.&quot; 

&quot;Not only you....but the others.&quot; His expression turned thoughtful. &quot;I 
don&#39;t need all of them, you know. Just Serenity.&quot; He paused. &quot;And you, 
of course. You seem to have the gift of future sight. However you&#39;ve 
acquired it, I do not know. Through years of study, perhaps?&quot; Setsuna 
opened her mouth to speak, but Demando continued. &quot;Whatever the case, I 
don&#39;t need them all. Especially not Kazuki. She&#39;s a rogue, to difficult 
to control.&quot; 

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t!&quot; 

&quot;You can find another, choose a new mate.&quot; 

&quot;You...&quot; Setsuna paused for a moment, thought. What...is more important? 
My Queen&#39;s safety, and her happiness...or mine? 

&quot;I know what will come to pass, Demando. Whatever actions you take will 
not change the final result, merely the actions leading to it. For my 
queen, I will...do anything. You were right; I was selfish. But not 
today. I will not allow you to hurt any others. Do...as you wish. What 
will be will be. You cannot stop it, no matter how hard you try.&quot; 

Demando&#39;s face twisted into such an expression of rage, that Setsuna 
recoiled slightly. 

&quot;I&#39;ll force it out of you!&quot; 

&quot;Try. Your mind control isn&#39;t strong enough to break my defenses. You&#39;ll 
only succeed in exhausting yourself.&quot; 

&quot;Then I&#39;ll kill everyone.&quot; 

&quot;They are more resilient than you think. They are waiting, waiting for a 
moment when your hold becomes too weak over them. You forget, you are 
dealing with very powerful women.&quot; Setsuna allowed herself a smirk. 

Demando frowned, waved a hand. &quot;Very well Setsuna. Very well. But, you 
will regret this.&quot; 

Setsuna nodded sadly. &quot;I know.&quot; 

--------------- 

The slow hum of the engine was beginning to lull Celeste into sleep, but 
she fought to stay awake. 

&quot;Why couldn&#39;t we do it the old-fashioned way, with horses?&quot; 

Mia gave her a rather unladylike snort. &quot;You&#39;re kidding me. What would 
we look like, riding in on horses?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m just saying, being in this nice, cushy car is making me sleepy. I 
won&#39;t be on the top of my game.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;ll be fine. Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; The car skidded to a halt. 

&quot;We&#39;re here?&quot; Celeste asked, glancing up. 

&quot;We&#39;re here.&quot; 

Celeste glanced at the large, foreboding building in the distance. 
&quot;Looks like a haunted apartment building.&quot; 

&quot;It very well could be.&quot; 

&quot;How exactly, are we going to find our way in there?&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;ll manage.&quot; 

&quot;They have security, I bet. And, I&#39;m sure they know we&#39;re coming.&quot; 

&quot;They might.&quot; 

&quot;Stop being cryptic!&quot; 

&quot;Can&#39;t help it.&quot; she grinned. &quot;In my blood.&quot; 

&quot;Grandpa always said you Repiamseus were too mysterious for your own 
good.&quot; 

&quot;And grandmother said the Videames were always too reckless.&quot; 

Celeste leaned against the car, frowned. &quot;Hmph. Are you worried?&quot; 

&quot;A little. We&#39;ve never had to deal with a whole group of the things. 
One, here and there, yes. But never more than that.&quot; 

&quot;We just have to wait. Lure them out around sunrise, then, boom. No more 
vampires. At least this group.&quot; 

&quot;Stay alive until sunrise...sounds like fun.&quot; she smiled, and blinked 
when she heard the familiar ring of her cell phone. &quot;Who could be 
calling...&quot; 

Celeste leaned over Mia&#39;s shoulder. &quot;What is it?&quot; 

&quot;Someone is coming...to this area. I thought it was closed off...&quot; she 
blinked in confusion. 

Celeste sighed. &quot;Always something...&quot; 

--------------- 

&quot;Are there people here already?&quot; Mitsuki asked. 

Rei rifled in her pockets for the weapon from Kazuki&#39;s shop. &quot;They can&#39;t 
be here already. I thought they would still be inside...&quot; 

&quot;Hey, Hino.&quot; 

&quot;Hmm?&quot; 

&quot;How&#39;d you know how to find this place?&quot; 

Rei paused, blinked. How had she known how to get there? &quot;I...&quot; She felt 
a tug, barely there, on the fringes of her mind. Could that have been... 
&quot;I&#39;m not sure...&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re not sure? How can&#39;t you be--&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. Worry about those people up ahead.&quot; 

Mitsuki clamped her mouth shut, and Rei opted instead to get her badge 
instead of the weapon. For some reason, she knew these people weren&#39;t 
vampires. 

&quot;Police!&quot; She cried out. The two glanced up. 

&quot;Police...?&quot; One asked smoothly. 

&quot;What are police officers doing here?&quot; the second muttered. 

&quot;This is a restricted area, and a private residence!&quot; Rei continued. 
&quot;Please get in your vehicle, and leave!&quot; 

Both of the women, to Rei&#39;s surprise, started to laugh. 

&quot;How do we know you&#39;re a police officer?&quot; 

Rei held her badge up again, and one woman, the taller one, shook her 
head. 

&quot;We can&#39;t see it from here, dear. We don&#39;t have night vision, you know.&quot; 

Rei coughed, and Mitsuki snickered. 

&quot;I want you to move slowly toward me. No sudden movements.&quot; 

&quot;Are you kidding me?&quot; she heard one of the women whisper. &quot;Paranoid, 
isn&#39;t she?&quot; 

&quot;What are you doing here alone?&quot; the other woman said. &quot;Your friend,&quot; 
she motioned to Mitsuki, &quot;doesn&#39;t appear to be an officer of the law. 
You seem to be the suspicious one.&quot; She flicked a business card over to 
Rei. &quot;I&#39;m an executive of SpYder Incorporated, Mia Repiamseu. My friend 
here is, as well. We&#39;re defense dealers, you see.&quot; 

&quot;So you make weapons.&quot; 

&quot;For government corporations, yes. We don&#39;t believe in illegal behavior, 
Detective. You are a Detective, am I right?&quot; 

&quot;Yes.&quot; This woman was too smooth, Rei realized. Her friend was quiet, 
let her speak. &quot;But what are you doing here, Ms. Repiamseu, and...&quot; 

&quot;Videame. Celeste Videame,&quot; the second said. 

&quot;Right. What are you two doing here?&quot; 

&quot;We could ask the same of you,&quot; Celeste said sharply. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re 
off duty by now.&quot; 

&quot;If this area is restricted, what are you doing around here at these 
hours, I wonder...&quot; Mia mused quietly to herself. &quot;I haven&#39;t heard of 
anything happening in these parts. Unless you know something we don&#39;t?&quot; 

Rei frowned. She didn&#39;t like these women, didn&#39;t trust them. &quot;Listen, 
just run along. I have to do a quick look-out of this place, because 
we&#39;ve heard of trouble--&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t regular patrol cops do that?&quot; Celeste asked. &quot;I mean, seems like 
a pretty small thing for a detective to be doing.&quot; 

&quot;That is, if you&#39;re a detective...&quot; Mia murmured softly. She glanced at 
the building. &quot;If you must know, we have friends around these parts.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t believe you,&quot; Rei said sharply. The tugging at her mind grew 
stronger, she had to figure out what these two girls were up to... 

&quot;We don&#39;t believe you,&quot; Mia countered coolly. She shifted her weight; 
Rei caught the glimpse of something metallic, gleaming in the night. 

&quot;Drop your weapon!&quot; 

&quot;Weapon?&quot; Mia moved her hand to her right hip, grazed her fingers across 
the gun. She removed it, and slowly dropped it on the ground. She 
glanced up, and her eyes narrowed. 

&quot;Celeste,&quot; she hissed, her fingers tightening around the gun again. 
&quot;Look at her eyes...&quot; 

Celeste did indeed look, and quickly as she could, moved back, pulled 
out her own gun. &quot;Fuck!&quot; She glanced at Mitsuki as well, frowned. &quot;Hey 
kid, move out of the way!&quot; 

Mitsuki frowned in confusion. &quot;What...?&quot; 

The sharp pop of bullets ricocheted through the air, one catching Rei in 
the shoulder, the other, her hip. 

Rei gasped in pain, stared in fascinated horror as the wounds closed 
over, the bullets popping out with a hollow click. Just like Serenity... 

&quot;Just as I thought,&quot; Mia remarked, lowering the still smoking gun in her 
hand. &quot;You&#39;re one of them.&quot; 

------------------ 

Everyone is probably confused now. Read the previous chapters, and 
you&#39;ll see hints to Rei&#39;s vampirism. Serenity is a more powerful 
vampire, no, so the effects would take longer than they would have with 
a less...powerful vampire. Also, Rei&#39;s eyes were glowing, much like 
Michiru&#39;s did in the chapter where she and Haruka got Makoto.
