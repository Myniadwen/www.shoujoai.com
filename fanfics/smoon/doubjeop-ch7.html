<a href="../smoon/doubjeop-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Shocking Conversation

&quot;OK . . . well, I&#39;m not sure about anyone else here, but my head hurts 
now,&quot; Haruka said from her place on the couch, after listening to Makoto 
describe to her and Michiru how badly things had gone when she had tried 
to tell Ami how she truly felt and how she had found out who her online 
girlfriend was.

Normally, personal relationships were discussed outside of senshi 
business. In this case it was an exception. Setsuna had made a call to 
let everyone in on a small secret about the future. Perhaps the largest 
disturbance that had happened so far to the time stream since Ami&#39;s 
first encounter with the Sekkou had occurred tonight. Originally, Makoto 
was supposed to have enough time to tell Ami she was Pielover. Instead, 
because of Ami&#39;s current emotional and psychological problems from her 
capture, she hadn&#39;t given her enough time to explain that and left.

On the surface, that would still seem like a personal problem, as said 
before. However, Ami and Makoto&#39;s relationship was somehow connected to 
the formation of Crystal Tokyo in the future, about which Setsuna was 
less forthcoming with details. The point was, unless the two lovebirds 
got together and started, well, loving, everything about the future 
would be thrown into question. While the evil Sekkou were a looming 
threat, at the moment they were the distant one. So for the first time 
ever, the Sailor team was being forced to play a no holds barred, 
high-stakes game of love connection to solve the fate of the future 
world. No pressure, right?

It was time for suggestions. The Senshi of love and Ami were absent from 
the current emergency meeting being held at Makoto&#39;s apartment following 
the concert. Ami and Minako had gone back to their apartment where 
Minako was hopefully living up to her constant comments about being the 
Senshi of love while the rest decided what to do.

Haruka grabbed her head in her hands for a moment, deep in thought. How 
hard could this be? When no ideas came to her, she said quietly, earning 
her a thump on the back of the head from Michiru for saying it in 
Hotaru&#39;s presence, &quot;I need a beer. OW!&quot;

Hotaru said, &quot;Why not just have Makoto march over there right now and 
tell her? Wouldn&#39;t that be simple enough?&quot;

Rei sighed, then said, &quot;Because it&#39;s too risky this soon after receiving 
a wound to the heart like that, and Ami may . . . over analyze it. If 
Makoto says something now, Ami may think Minako has been messing with 
her computer while she isn&#39;t around and merely supplied Makoto with the 
name. Plus, destroying her trust in all of us.&quot; Rei decided it was best 
not to mention that both her and Minako had actually been doing just 
that.

&quot;Plus, she&#39;s a total emotional basket case at the moment, and Kami knows 
wha- OW! Will you quit that!?&quot; Haruka had made the honest, yet hurtful 
comment and received a warning knock from her lover reminding her to 
mind her manners again.

Ignoring the two of them, Setsuna said, &quot;The point is, Hotaru, whatever 
we do, it has to be done delicately. If we move too fast and crowd Ami 
while she is hurting, it could make things even harder.&quot;

Usagi looked like she was about to strain something from thinking so 
hard. Suddenly, she piped up, &quot;Hey! I&#39;ve got an idea! How about a 
romantic dinner, dancing . . . a walk . . . roses . . . You know? The 
basics! We can all chip in and turn it into a truly romantic night for 
the two of them.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; said Rei sarcastically. &quot;That&#39;s a great idea. But how do we 
get them together for said date?&quot;

Usagi&#39;s sheepish reply was, &quot;Well . . . I hadn&#39;t thought that far ahead 
yet . . . &quot;

Rei groaned in a fit of irritation, then said, &quot;Well . . . at least it&#39;s 
a good idea for what to do for the date once we get to that part. Any 
ideas on how to set them up, Setsuna?&quot;

Setsuna, who was deep in thought, almost hadn&#39;t noticed she was being 
addressed. Looking up, surprised, she said, &quot;Don&#39;t look at me. I haven&#39;t 
been romantically involved with someone since . . . October 27th 1482.&quot; 
That drew a lot of looks from her group of friends.

Mamoru covered his eyes with one hand in embarrassment as Usagi asked, 
&quot;How can you go for five hundred twenty odd years without . . . it? That 
would drive me crazy!&quot; Setsuna blushed furiously, both in shock for 
being asked such a private question, and because, coming from Usagi, the 
question sounded somehow worse than it was since she usually came across 
as being so innocent.

Michiru covered Hotaru&#39;s ears. &quot;That&#39;s a rather personal question, don&#39;t 
you think, Usagi?&quot; Michiru said in Setsuna&#39;s defense.

Haruka said, laughing, &quot;Oh no, I&#39;d love to hear the answer to that one!&quot;

Michiru looked at Haruka angrily. &quot;You really want to sleep on the couch 
tonight, don&#39;t you?&quot;

Haruka&#39;s response was to mimic zipping her lips and throwing away a key.

Mamoru shrugged. &quot;I could give you a few pointers if you were looking to 
hook one of you up with a guy, but I haven&#39;t got the slightest clue how 
to keep one woman happy, let alone two.&quot;

Usagi gushed, &quot;You&#39;re so modest, Mamo-chan.&quot;

Makoto finally decided to remind the rest of them she was a part of this 
conversation too. Gradually raising her voice with every syllable from a 
whisper to practically screaming, she said, &quot;Would you guys mind 
focusing on the problem at hand?!&quot;

Luna, who had tagged along to the concert in Usagi&#39;s purse, decided to 
speak her mind. Raising a paw in an effort to get their attention, the 
small black cat said from atop the TV, looking like a queen speaking 
from a lofty throne, &quot;I&#39;ve got an idea.&quot;

Rei looked at Luna for a moment. &quot;An alien cat is going to give us all 
knowledge on setting up two lesbian human women. This I gotta hear. Tell 
us, Luna, does it involve catnip and a scratching post? If so, I can&#39;t 
wait to see the video.&quot;

&quot;You know, given the choice between listening to all of you go on and 
on, or hearing what the cat is going to let out of the bag, I choose the 
cat!&quot; Makoto said, finding it difficult to hide her frustration. &quot;From 
what I can tell, Luna and I have one thing in common. We&#39;re the only two 
here who don&#39;t find this amusing!&quot;

While everyone else suddenly found something else other than making eye 
contact with Makoto a good thing to do, Luna said politely, &quot;Why don&#39;t 
you just have &#39;Cherry pie lover&#39; stick with the plan? The only 
difference is that now you will have a bigger budget to work with than 
you were probably planning, and you have more information than you did 
before. You know who your date is now, at least.&quot;

Makoto opened her mouth to say something, but couldn&#39;t quite figure out 
what to say, so she closed her mouth again and just stared at the cat. 
Hotaru decided to speak for her. &quot;That&#39;s just crazy enough to work!&quot;

&quot;I vote for waiting for Ami to come to her senses, honestly.&quot; said Rei. 
&quot;I mean, can you see the look on Ami&#39;s face when she is expecting to 
meet this dashing mysterious woman, and in walks the woman who&#39;s been 
slowly breaking her heart into little tiny pieces for a little over half 
her life?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not very fair, Rei. I was a kid! I was scared! What was I 
supposed to do?&quot; was Makoto&#39;s angry and slightly hurt reply.

Rei looked at Makoto, a little irritated, as she said coldly, &quot;I don&#39;t 
know . . . you could have told her . . . maybe?&quot;

Haruka sat up and spoke, even though she knew it would earn her at least 
the current night&#39;s sleep on the couch. &quot;No no Makoto, I think Rei is 
onto something. Just picture it for a sec. There&#39;s Ami, sitting there 
all shyly, prettied up, and looking to finally get over 15 years of 
suffering and repressed desire from not receiving the affection from 
someone who she loved by falling for someone else. Then, Makoto sits 
down next to her and says, &#39;Hey baby, miss me?&#39;&quot; Then, miming the action 
Haruka thought Ami would take, she said, &quot;Then, POW! Mako-chan gets 
slapped upside the face with the world renowned 
slap-heard-round-the-world.&quot; Sitting back, smiling sarcastically, she 
said, &quot;Yeah, that&#39;ll go great. I know you guys hate hearing this, but 
Ami is a bit of an emotional basket case at the moment.&quot;

Michiru was just about to pound Haruka again when she realized 
something. &quot;I think Haruka and Rei have a point. Makoto would be taking 
an awful risk to approach this right now . . . &quot;

Setsuna said quietly, &quot;Love is always a risk. I think that -- &quot;

Makoto suddenly interrupted Setsuna, saying, &quot;Did anyone else hear 
that?&quot;

Luna perked her ears up for a moment as everyone strained to listen for 
a sound, then said, &quot;No. Hear what?&quot; Just as Luna finished, a soft quiet 
chime was heard coming from the direction of Makoto&#39;s bed room. As soon 
as the chime finished, Makoto turned on her heels and ran toward the 
computer. Everyone else looked at the empty spot where the woman had 
been a moment before.

Hotaru said, &quot;I think we should leave them alone and let them figure it 
out for themselves. Wouldn&#39;t that be the most responsible thing to do?&quot;

Setsuna said quietly, &quot;I think I&#39;m going to go peek in and make sure 
Makoto doesn&#39;t put her foot in her mouth again.&quot; As Setsuna turned to 
walk down the hall, everyone remaining in the room followed like a small 
army behind her.

PBJ1978: Please tell me you&#39;re there.

PBJ1978: I really could use someone to talk to. You may still be out I 
suppose.

As everyone piled into the room behind Makoto, she said to herself 
quietly, &quot;What do I say to her?&quot;

Everyone started chattering excitedly, voicing their opinions so rapidly 
and at the same time that Makoto couldn&#39;t follow who was speaking. They 
were everything from, &#39;tell her I love you&#39;, &#39;tell her the truth&#39;, &#39;tell 
her you want her&#39;, &#39;disconnect and don&#39;t talk to her,&#39; and more. Makoto 
decided to just play it safe and say something . . . basic.

Cherrypielover: Hi! I&#39;m here. How are you?

Once Makoto hit send, everyone got so quiet that the only sound heard in 
the room was the quiet whirring sound from the fan inside Makoto&#39;s 
computer. There was a long dramatic pause as Ami, on the other end, 
typed her reply.

PBJ1978: Terrible. Remember the girl I was telling you about? The only 
one who would ever give you a run for your money? The straight, 
unobtainable one? She came up to me after I was through talking to you 
at the concert and expressed her undying love for me. It only took her 
fifteen years to do it. Didn&#39;t she care how that would make me feel? 
Didn&#39;t she realize that after all this time it was better for her not to 
hurt me like this and just let me be? I wanted you to know that I chose 
you over her. In the interest of fairness, you were brave enough to ask 
me first and I get the feeling you would never hurt me like that.

Makoto frowned as everyone leaning over her cringed. Rei said quietly, 
&quot;Ouch.&quot;

The only light in Ami&#39;s small room was coming from her computer monitor. 
Beside her in a chair from the kitchen table sat Minako. Minako looked 
at Ami after she hit send. Unlike Ami, Minako now knew who pielover was. 
&quot;Ouch . . . Ami, I know you&#39;re upset, but don&#39;t you think you&#39;re being 
just a little melodramatic about Makoto? I mean, at least she finally -- 
&quot;

Ami held up a finger at Minako and said quietly, &quot;You stay out of this. 
You&#39;re lucky I&#39;m even letting you stay in here while I talk to her. And 
I would appreciate it if you not finish that sentence.&quot;

Cherrypielover: That was awfully sweet of you to do . . . but if she has 
felt that way about you for so long, maybe you should consider giving 
her a chance instead . . .

Haruka began saying, &quot;No no no no! Don&#39;t send that!&quot; just a second too 
late for Makoto to hit the delete button. Dead silence reined supreme in 
Kino&#39;s bedroom once again as everyone held their breath waiting for the 
next response.

PBJ1978: I&#39;d rather be with you now. She had her chance and she blew it. 
Now you deserve one. You deserve to have me all to yourself without 
worrying about such things. It&#39;s only fair, and it&#39;s the right thing to 
do. Besides . . . I want you.

Haruka made a quiet cat whistling sound, getting smacked on the back of 
the head by both Michiru and Setsuna. Ignoring them both, she said as 
she grabbed the back of Makoto&#39;s chair shaking it a bit, &quot;She wants you, 
Makoto!&quot;

PBJ1978: We should start planning our date for Saturday.

Makoto thought to herself how very much like Ami it was for her to get 
to the point. How on earth hadn&#39;t she realized who PBJ was sooner? &quot;OK . 
. . obviously she&#39;s made up her mind what she wants to do . . . so, now 
or never time, guys . . . Should we give Saturday a try?&quot; After 
receiving a chorus of yeses, Makoto typed:

Cherrypielover: Sure thing. So, what did you have in mind?

PBJ1978: I hate to say this, but my roommate is insisting on reading 
over my shoulder . . . it makes it a little strange to discuss. But she 
suggests C&#39;zon Ebisu. It&#39;s a little expensive. OK, it&#39;s extremely 
expensive, but it&#39;s romantic. Dancing, live music, great food . . . I 
think she may be on to something, even if she is disrespecting my 
privacy, personal space, and all-around being irritating.

Makoto laughed quietly to herself, both because she knew the last part 
was more directed to Minako than her, and because she knew the feeling 
at the moment. Looking over her shoulder, she said nervously, &quot;You guys 
are footing the bill still, right?&quot;

Mamoru grumbled under his breath, &quot;I&#39;m going to kill Minako the next 
time I see her. Yeah, Makoto, we&#39;ll buy.&quot;

Cherrypielover: Sounds good to me! I know we planned on 8:30 PM, but how 
about we push it back to around 7 to give us more time?

Rei said quietly, &quot;Yeah . . . maybe allow you to . . . you know . . . 
argue a while before you actually get around to enjoying your date . . . 
if she stays that long . . . &quot;

Michiru whispered something into Makoto&#39;s ear, then Makoto typed out,

Cherrypielover: Hey, you were at the concert tonight, so I know you know 
who Michiru and Haruka are. They happen to be good friends of mine. How 
about we double date?

Haruka said quietly, pointing at Michiru, &quot;That is so coming out of your 
share of the spending money.&quot;

&quot;But honey, it&#39;s to make sure everything goes OK. Surely you understand 
someone should go to make sure everything turns out alright.&quot;

PBJ1978: Yeah . . . more time to get to know each other would be good. 
You know them too? Wow, that&#39;s a coincidence. I&#39;ve known those two for 
years. They got me discount tickets to the concert. I couldn&#39;t have 
afforded the good seats I had otherwise. Yeah, sure it&#39;s OK if they come 
along . . . I guess they&#39;ll find out about us eventually anyway, now 
that my roommate knows.

Minako said excitedly and loudly into Ami&#39;s ear, &quot;Woo hoo! Hey, how 
about we all just go? That&#39;d be a blast! We could--&quot;

Normally she would have ignored the comment, but instead, Ami said 
quietly, not mincing any words with her roommate, &quot;Be quiet, Minako.&quot;

Cherrypielover: How about I have them come by and pick you up and then I 
can take you home?

Ami suddenly swiveled in her chair to look at Minako, her glasses giving 
the small bluenette an overly serious look. &quot;Minako-chan? I know you&#39;re 
happy for me and all . . . but how about you leave and let me say 
goodnight to my girlfriend, OK?&quot;

&quot;OK, but might I suggest -- &quot;

&quot;Get out, Minako.&quot;

Ami waited until Minako had walked out of the room before typing the 
rest of what she was thinking.

PBJ1978: Sounds good. However, maybe you could stay with me instead of 
going home?

Every jaw in Makoto&#39;s room dropped, except for Hotaru&#39;s. She didn&#39;t 
quite catch the meaning of Ami&#39;s comment. Rei gulped down a breath of 
air loudly, and said, &quot;Wow . . . she wants to move kinda . . . fast, 
doesn&#39;t she?&quot;

Cherrypielover/blushes Sure thing.

Feeling that they had at least for the moment solved the problem, 
Setsuna calmly left the room since the rest of the conversation really 
didn&#39;t pertain to them after that point.

PBJ1978: You know what the first thing I want to do when we get there 
is?

&quot;OKAY! Hotaru, time to go!&quot; Haruka said loudly, pushing her adopted 
daughter out of the room as she protested.

Michiru leaned over Makoto&#39;s shoulder as Ami sent more messages. 
Messages that caused Makoto to blush so much, even her ears turned a 
dark red. Usagi was so shocked by some of the things she had read before 
Mamoru pulled her away that her eyes were still wide open even after she 
was guided out to the living room in a daze.

Michiru said quietly, &quot;I think I&#39;ll stick around just a little more. I 
don&#39;t know from what she is saying whether or not she has actually been 
with someone, but she sounds like she is trying to release a lot of 
held-up desire.&quot; As another message appeared, she added, &quot;She could be 
using her extensive knowledge of human anatomy, after all . . . and who 
knew Ami-chan could be so . . . wow . . . imaginative?&quot;

Makoto and &#39;PBJ&#39; had had a few conversations along these lines before, 
mostly when one of them was feeling a little . . . needing at the 
moment, since it was the closest they could come to being intimate. 
Makoto said out the side of her mouth, quietly, as her eyes opened wide 
when she read the next message to cross the screen, &quot;You really would be 
surprised, Michiru.&quot;

Haruka said from out in the living room, while Hotaru, who hadn&#39;t quite 
caught on to why she had been suddenly removed from what she felt was 
legitimate Senshi affairs was busy protesting, &quot;Mich! We&#39;re leaving!&quot;

Michiru grumbled to herself, &quot;Fine, fine! All right! Be right there!&quot; 
and left Makoto, who finally looked up from the screen to stare at Rei, 
who hadn&#39;t moved an inch yet.

&quot;Rei? You mind?!&quot; Makoto said, her face still beet red in embarrassment.

Rei, still in shock as yet another message chimed onto the screen, 
blinked her violet eyes twice then said, &quot;Oh yeah! Um, OK . . . &quot; As she 
walked off, Makoto heard the Senshi of fire say to herself, &quot;Wonder if 
Ami is really that flexible?&quot; Then, back to Makoto she said, &quot;Hey, why 
don&#39;t you let us know how that goes, kay?&quot;

As Makoto sat in front of her desk with her hands covering her face as 
Ami typed out another . . . descriptive text, she said quietly to the 
now-retreating Rei, &quot;Just shut up and close the door on your way out, 
won&#39;t you?&quot;

Yes. The girl could be very shocking when she wanted to be.
