<h1>Wild Fire, Crystal Ice (part 2 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/wfci-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Serenity was shocked. (Did this woman just call me a mutt?) Serenity&#39;s 
disbelief in the woman&#39;s choice of words was destroyed when Rei spoke 
again. &quot;Minako, why do you have to be such a ditz?! Do you even know 
where this mutt came from?! She might be a damn orphanage runaway! You 
know what happened last time! We don&#39;t need any cops lookin&#39; for 
runaways! We got our own problems!!&quot; Minako winced. &quot;Listen Rei, does 
she look like a orphan? She&#39;s got money, you can tell that from what 
she&#39;s wearing. And besides,&quot; she leaned in close to Rei, &quot;we need the 
cash. I bet her parents are loaded.&quot; Rei walked toward Serenity and 
glared at her. Serenity was quite frightened, but she couldn&#39;t take 
her eyes away from Rei&#39;s own. (Her eyes, are they violet? I&#39;ve never 
seen violet eyes before. They&#39;re absolutely beautiful...) 

Rei&#39;s sharp voice knocked her out of her observation. &quot;What&#39;s your 
name kid?! And I want first *and* last names, understand?&quot; Serenity 
answered quickly, so as not to anger the redhead further. &quot;Um, 
Serenity. Se, Serenity Loned.&quot; Rei glowered at her. &quot;Don&#39;t stutter! 
Did you say Loned? As in Lo-ned?! The Loned family?! Minako! You just 
kidnapped a princess!! A godamned princess! I don&#39;t care what Mitsuki 
says! This time I&#39;m going to kill you!!!&quot; Minako started to run. She 
quickly scampered behind Mitsuki, who looked less than thrilled about 
being put in the middle of the argument. But she couldn&#39;t just let Rei 
beat up on her girlfriend, so she decided to play the peacemaker. &quot;Um 
Rei, I&#39;m sure Mina-chan had no idea that the girl was a Loned. She&#39;s 
not a princess, by the way. And besides, the kid is all alone. We 
can&#39;t just let her out on the streets. Come on Rei. Don&#39;t be mean.&quot; 
Makoto shook her head and stared at Mitsuki. &quot;You might as well be 
asking her not to breathe. Rei is always angry. It comes naturally to 
her.&quot; Rei glared at Makoto. &quot;Shut up! Mitsuki, just move out of the 
way so that I can murder Minako, okay! I don&#39;t want to kill you, I 
just want to kill your stupid girlfriend!&quot;

Mitsuki frowned. &quot;Honestly Rei, let the kid stay here. Quit being such 
a jerk! And Minako is not stupid! She&#39;s just a little absentminded 
sometimes.&quot; Rei shook her head. &quot;Whatever.&quot; She turned to Serenity. 
&quot;Listen kid, thanks to the two lovebirds here,&quot; she waved her hand in 
Minako and Mitsuki&#39;s direction, &quot;you get to stay.&quot; Serenity smiled 
brightly. &quot;Oh thank you...&quot; Rei cut her off. &quot;But you got to work if 
you&#39;re going to stay here. You need a new name too.&quot; Minako grinned. 
&quot;How about Yoko?&quot; Rei frowned. &quot;No way. That&#39;s goofy.&quot; The other girls 
started to call out names.

&quot;Silver?&quot;

&quot;How creative. How about Angel?&quot;

&quot;No way! Koneko is a cute name.&quot;

&quot;Jeez, just put her on &#39;Hello Kitty,&#39; and call it a day.&quot;

Rei sighed weakly. &quot;Listen, I&#39;ve got a name for you kid.&quot; The other 
girls stopped bickering to hear the name. Rei grinned at Serenity.

&quot;Usagi.&quot;

The other women smiled and Serenity nodded in approval. &quot;I like that.&quot; 
Minako smiled, and then she frowned, deep in thought. &quot;What about a 
last name?&quot; Rei smirked. 

&quot;Congratulations Minako, because you now have a new little sister. 
Introducing Usagi Nedal!&quot;

&quot;What?! No way! I can&#39;t have a little sister!&quot;

&quot;You do now. You found her, so she&#39;s your responsibility...&quot;

.... Endymion Janod rolled his midnight blue eyes in frustration as he 
listened to Drake Loned sob over the phone about his missing daughter. 
He fought the urge to scream at the older man. &#39;I can&#39;t believe that 
little brat ran off!&#39; he thought, running his fingers through his coal 
black hair. &#39;You&#39;d think the spoiled little twit would be happy about 
being married to me!&#39; But he decided to feign concern and sympathy. 
&quot;Well sir,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;m sure I can find her. I have a couple 
of...friends that might be able to help us.&quot; Drake stopped sniffling. 
&quot;Oh, you do my boy? That&#39;s excellent! Well, I&#39;ll leave you to your 
work. But until you get in contact with them, I did call the 
authorities. I&#39;m sure they would appreciate the extra help. No greater 
help than the law, you know! I do hope they find my poor Serenity. She 
must be terrified.&quot; Endymion sighed. &quot;Yes, I&#39;m sure she is. Listen 
sir, I really have to go. Good bye.&quot; As soon as he was off of the 
phone, he dialed another number. He would find Serenity, and they 
*would* be married.

Whether she wanted to or not...

Hotaru Desal watched her adoptive mother carefully. &quot;Setsuna-mama, 
will we be going to see Rei-san, and the others today?&quot; Setsuna turned 
to face the teenager, and she smiled, which was a rare occurrence. 
&quot;Well, I think that we can...&quot; She stopped talking when the phone 
rang. &quot;I&#39;ll get it!&quot; Hotaru said cheerfully, grabbing the phone. 
&quot;Hello, Desal residence. May I ask who&#39;s speaking?&quot; Setsuna watched 
the young woman&#39;s face contort in anger. &quot;Endymion...&quot; Hotaru hissed 
through clenched teeth... 

... &quot;Well I guess we better introduce ourselves. My name&#39;s Makoto 
Ginas.&quot; Serenity smiled at the tall green haired girl. Another, 
smaller young woman with blue hair walked over to Serenity. &quot;My name 
is Ami Tepo. It is a pleasure to meet you.&quot; A white haired woman who 
Minako had snuggled up to on the couch waved to Serenity cheerfully. 
&quot;I&#39;m Mitsuki Niade! It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you!&quot; Rei rolled her eyes. 
&quot;The name&#39;s Rei Talon, and I&#39;m the boss.&quot; Serenity&#39;s eyes widened. 
&quot;You...you were on the most wanted list! You stole from Lady Nadia of 
Venus, not to mention quite a few socialites.&quot; Rei grinned. &quot;Yep! I&#39;m 
proud of it too. Our space shuttle is stolen too, but I repainted it. 
I hate the color yellow,&quot; she ignored the raspberry Minako gave her, 
&quot;and red and black are my favorite colors. You got anything to say 
about it kid?&quot;

Serenity shook her head. &quot;No, no. It&#39;s just that I have never been in 
the company of...well criminals before.&quot; Minako winced, and Rei&#39;s eyes 
darkened. &quot;We&#39;re criminals huh? Well, unlike you sweetheart, we 
weren&#39;t offered anything on a silver platter. And in my world its 
&quot;take or die.&quot; I&#39;m not about to just roll over and die, so I&#39;m taking 
from people who had too much to begin with! That&#39;s not stealing; 
that&#39;s surviving!&quot; Serenity rolled her eyes. &quot;Oh spare me. You could 
work, like everyone else. And stealing is stealing; no matter who you 
steal from.&quot; Minako and Mitsuki cringed. &quot;Oh, she&#39;s gonna get killed.&quot; 
Minako murmured, nuzzling against Mitsuki&#39;s neck as she spoke. Ami 
suddenly became engrossed in a book, and Makoto practically ran into 
the kitchen. Mitsuki grabbed Minako&#39;s arm, and they both darted into 
the safety of the kitchen. Ami soon followed them, her face hidden by 
the book. 

Serenity had, by now noticed that everyone had disappeared. She 
gulped, and stared up into Rei&#39;s eyes. The gorgeous amethyst eyes that 
she had admired earlier had now turned a stormy, dangerous black.  Rei 
moved closer to Serenity until they were inches apart. &quot;Listen to me, 
you spoiled little idiot. The only reason you&#39;re here is because of 
Minako, her girlfriend, and the grace of God. You do anything, 
*anything* to get me angry, and I&#39;ll rip your throat out and mail it 
to your snobby parents. No more backtalk. Got it?&quot; Serenity nodded, 
and Rei smiled wickedly at her. &quot;Good girl. Now remember *Usagi*,&quot; she 
tapped Serenity&#39;s forehead with her forefinger, &quot;watch your mouth.&quot; 
Serenity nodded dumbly, and Rei sauntered off. Serenity found herself 
watching the sway of her hips as she walked away. She quickly shook 
her head to clear her mind of the rather lewd images that were 
flashing through it. She was not a princess, but she was quite close 
to it, and she would not allow herself to have such...naughty 
thoughts.

Even if Miss Rei Talon was rather attractive...

Haruka Radoun sighed in annoyance. (Once again, I&#39;m stuck looking for 
a kid that ran away from her parents. Jesus, I&#39;d rather be at home 
with Michiru, but no, I&#39;m on patrol. Shit! Why couldn&#39;t the little 
brat run away at a more convenient time! I could be at home snuggling 
up with my mermaid....damn it!) She frowned, and ran her fingers 
through her light-blue hair. She stared out of the side window of her 
car, and saw a sight that nearly made her crash the vehicle.

It was Setsuna and Hotaru Desal.

The galaxy&#39;s most renowned bounty hunters....

...Minako hummed cheerfully as she brushed Mitsuki&#39;s long hair. &quot;Hey 
Suki-chan? You think the boss likes that kid?&quot; Mitsuki sighed, trying 
to pull her mind away from the soft stokes of the brush through her 
hair. It was a very delightful feeling, and Minako knew it. &quot;Mmm...I 
don&#39;t know. You&#39;re the expert on this, sweetheart. How would I know?&quot; 
Minako sighed, and momentarily stopped brushing, causing Mitsuki to 
groan in protest. &quot;Well, I&#39;m sure you saw the sparks flying between 
those two.&quot; Mitsuki pulled the brush away from Minako&#39;s hands, and 
began to brush her hair herself. &quot;Nope. I thought it was weird that 
the kid walked into the kitchen safe and sound after she mouthed off 
to Rei though. I thought she would be a crispy critter for sure. She&#39;s 
blessed,&quot; Mitsuki murmured, unclasping the cross she had around her 
neck and twirling it around her fingers, &quot;and she didn&#39;t even need 
this. Either she&#39;s got a kick-ass angel watching over her, or Rei is 
getting all goofy over a pair of nice legs, I&#39;d say.&quot; Minako&#39;s right 
eyelid started to twitch.

&quot;And what were you doing looking at her legs?!&quot;

&quot;Aww, come on Mina-chan, I was just kidding...&quot; 

...Hotaru frowned when she saw the tall police officer walk out of the 
car. &quot;Setsuna-mama, we have trouble.&quot; The older woman&#39;s crimson eyes 
flashed for a moment. &quot;Indeed Silent One. It seems as if Officer 
Radoun is interested in us. Perhaps we should greet her.&quot; Hotaru 
frowned. &quot;And why should we Setsuna-mama? I don&#39;t even want to do this 
job. Look at us! We are reduced to finding simpering, snot-nosed 
little rich brats! And it is his entire fault. Endymion...that sick, 
depraved bastard.&quot; Setsuna glared at her. 

&quot;Endymion may be all of that, but I won&#39;t have you using that word. We 
are in Endymion&#39;s debt, and he is still paying for us to find this 
child.&quot; Hotaru murmured something under her breath, but a glare from 
Setsuna made her stop. Haruka walked to the two bounty hunters, and 
glared at them. &quot;So what are you two ladies doing here?&quot; Hotaru 
smirked. &quot;Just like a cop. Do you remember how we helped you and your 
thief of a girlfriend?&quot; Haruka glared at the small girl. &quot;Michiru 
isn&#39;t a thief. She was just trying to get by. That was a rough time 
for her. Now, answer the question. What are you doing on Mars? You 
better not be looking for that Loned kid. She won&#39;t be here.&quot; Setsuna 
smiled. &quot;You&#39;d be surprised. Is Michiru well?&quot; Haruka nodded. &quot;Yeah, 
she&#39;s all right. I think she hates the shifts I have almost as much as 
I do. Jeez, I wish I could go home.&quot; Setsuna and Hotaru smiled. 
&quot;Indeed,&quot; Setsuna said, brushing a strand of black hair from her face, 
&quot;but work is work. We have to go now. Sayonara...&quot; Haruka watched in 
baffled amazement as the two disappeared into the shadows...

...Rei growled in frustration as she tried to relax. (Ugh, I have to 
stop thinking about that girl! Damn, I can&#39;t even get any sleep! This 
is all Minako&#39;s fault! Dumb blonde...)

...In her bed, with Mitsuki snuggled next to her, Minako smiled...</pre>
