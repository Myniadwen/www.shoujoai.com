<h1>Mi Domando Se Li Vedro Ancora (part 1 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Makoto stood quietly on her balconey, the snow slowly drifting down 
onto everything around her. She stood leaning against the wall next to 
her door, arms crossed, holding her leather jacket close to her for 
warmth.

She glanced up at the clouded sky, snow falling onto her lashes. She 
began making puffs of &#39;smoke&#39; with her breath, blowing them into the 
cold night air.

As she continued her little musings with the night air, her emerald 
eyes caught sight of a glimpse of a shadow coming towards her. She 
wasn&#39;t the slightest bit nervous or afraid when it landed next to her, 
revealing it was a gargoyle.

&quot;Any luck,&quot; she asked, continuing to make her puffs of smoke.

The creature shook his head. &quot;Iie. I think the negaverse is gone.&quot;

Makoto remined silent, thinking. Her eyes focused on something far 
away, the creature didn&#39;t know what.

&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; he said, placing a large, taloned hand on her shoulder. 
&quot;Are you alright?&quot;

She blinked and looked up at the gargoyle towering over her, then 
nodded. &quot;Hai.&quot; She refocused her eyes back to the point out over down 
town Tokyo. 

&quot;I&#39;m just thinking.&quot;

~I&#39;ve been searching for you
I heard a cry within my soul
I never had a yearning quite like this before
Now here you are walking right through my door~

Ace snored peacefully at the end of Makoto&#39;s bed, curled up into a 
ball. Makoto herself was still awake, stareing up at the ceiling. Her 
hands were placed behind her head as she thought about the past.

Tears welled in her eyes as the battle with Beryl replayed over and 
over and over again. Even tho she had been the first to die, she could 
still see the others die, one by one. After she had been killed, Ami 
had died next. Then Minako. And then Rei-chan. Lastly was Usagi, who 
had made a wish on the silver crystal before dying.

Makoto rolled over onto her side, her right hand gently caresing the 
spot on her satin sheets Minako had once occupied by her side at 
night. One tear fell down her face, remebereing what they once had 
together.

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;So, Mako-chan,&quot; Ace said, emerging from the room, yawning. &quot;What are 
we doing today?&quot; The blue cat made his way to the kitchen table where 
Makoto sat with the local newspaper in her hand.

&quot;Nothing much,&quot; Makoto answered, taking a sip of her juice. 

&quot;Really now,&quot; Ace said, jumping onto the table and taking a bagel from 
the dish in front of Makoto for himself. &quot;No plans on stalking a 
pretty blue eyed, blonde teenager?&quot;

Makoto lowered the paper to glare at the cat, who smirked at her over 
his breakfast.

&quot;I do not stalk her,&quot; Makoto said in defense. &quot;I just...&quot;

Ace looked at her, knowing he had hit a raw spot with Makoto, wishing 
he hadn&#39;t said what he had. &quot;You what, Mako-chan,&quot; he asked in a soft 
tone.

&quot;Iie, its nothing.&quot; Makoto continued to glance thru the paper. Ace 
nodded in understanding, letting the subject go.

Moments passed in silence. Makoto finished her juice, as Ace finished 
his bagel. He then looked at his ward, and smiled a bit. How she had 
grown up in the years he had known her...

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Makoto said. 

Ace cocked his head to the side. &quot;&#39;Hmmm&#39; what, Mako-chan?&quot;

&quot;Some one is trying to play tricks on the locals of Tokyo,&quot; Makoto 
said.

&quot;Why do you say that,&quot; Ace asked.

Makoto looked up at him, folded the news paper, and turned it so Ace 
could a photo. &quot;This is why,&quot; she said, pointing to the picture.

&quot;Looks like an odd crystal,&quot; Ace said, shrugging. &quot;What of it?&quot;

&quot;It may look like a crystal, but look at the back ground, Ace. Those 
are clouds.&quot;

Ace looked at her, then back to the black and white picture. &quot;You 
thinking its a UFO?&quot;

&quot;Possiably,&quot; Makoto said. &quot;But you said there were no traces of the 
negaverse, right?&quot;

&quot;The negaverse, hai,&quot; Ace said. &quot;But you know well enough that the 
negaverse was not the only evil force in the universe. Not to mention 
parallel ones. If thats a baddie, it could be from anywahere.&quot;

Makoto nodded. &quot;Hai.&quot; She sat silent for a moment, pondering something 
in her mind. &quot;Do you think we should check this out?&quot;

Ace nodded. &quot;Hai. Tonight. Where was it spotted?&quot;

Makoto took the paper and read the article, scanning for the place the 
photo was taken. &quot;Heart of down town Tokyo.&quot;

Ace chuckled. &quot;You&#39;d think these bad guys would find better places to 
strike in this town, ne?&quot;

Makoto smiled. &quot;Hai. But they are, like you said, baddies. They&#39;re 
just plain stupid.&quot;

~All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I&#39;ll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I&#39;ll see you again~

&quot;Have you two been getting any vibes lately,&quot; Ace asked as he walked 
in the park that afternoon with Luna and Artemis.

&quot;Hai,&quot; Luna said. &quot;But they do not remind me of the negaverse. They 
remind me of a greater evil.&quot;

&quot;Evere sense it before,&quot; Ace asked.

&quot;Iie,&quot;Artemis said. &quot;This force we&#39;re sensing is completely new to 
us.&quot;

Ace nodded. &quot;Do you think if it is a new enemy, we could take them 
without the senshi?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Luna said. &quot;I hope so. I&#39;d hate to have to make them 
remember their past once again.&quot;

Ace nodded. He had yet to tell them Makoto had retained her memory. 
Not to mention useing her senshi powers to fight the stray youma here 
and there left over from the rein of Beryl.

&quot;How&#39;s is Mako-chan doing,&quot; Artemis asked Ace.

The blue cat smiled, sitting next to the water&#39;s edge. &quot;She&#39;s doing 
fine. How&#39;s Minako?&quot;

&quot;Oh she&#39;s still Minako,&quot; The white cat said, laughing. &quot;You know, 
bubblely, spazzy, and forgetful. Just with out the senshi powers.&quot;

&quot;Sounds like Usagi,&quot; Luna said curtley.

Ace laughed.

~A sacred gift of heaven
For better, worse, wherever
And I would never let somebody break you down
Or take your crown never~

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;That movie was great,&quot; exclaimed Naru as she and Usagi walked out of 
the movie theatre.

&quot;Hai,&quot; Usagi agreed happily. &quot;&#39;Bless the child&#39; has been one of the 
best spooks I&#39;ve ever seen!&quot;

Naru nodded her head in agreement, smiling. &quot;The special affects were 
great!&quot;

The girls giggled as they walked down the dark streets, retelling 
their favorite scenes. The crowd around them was thick enough for them 
not to fear much, thinking if anyone attacked them, they&#39;d be fine.

However, the crowds began to thin as the continued to walk, making the 
girls somewhat nervous.

&quot;Usagi-chan,&quot; Naru said quietly. &quot;Do you really think we should 
continue walking by ourselves?&quot;

&quot;Why not? There are safety in numbers,&quot;Usagi said. &quot;And there are two 
of us. What could possiably happen?&quot;

Naru looked down at the ground, closed her eyes and smiled. &quot;Hai, 
you&#39;re right.&quot; She opened her eyes to look at Usagi. &quot;I was 
just....being.......silly.....&quot; 

Naru&#39;s face paled as she stared over Usagi&#39;s shoulder. Usagi blinked, 
confused at Naru&#39;s behaviour.

&quot;Naru-chan? Whats wrong?&quot;

Naru began to shake with fear, stuttering as she pointed. 
&quot;Y-youma....b-b-behi-ind you...&quot; Naur swallowed the lump in her throat 
as Usagi turned.

&quot;Nani?&quot; Usagi turned to face a ten foot youma, eyes glowing red. The 
two girls couldn&#39;t make the features out, but it looked humanoid for 
the most part. Usagi&#39;s face paled as well as her eyes connected with 
the monster&#39;s. 

&quot;Uh...oh...&quot;

The youma roared and slashed out the girls, who barely escaped from 
the attack. Tripping over one another, they fell to the ground, 
trembleing with fear.

------------------------------------------------------------

As the monster neared them, Usagi began to hear its voice chanting, 
&quot;Where is she?! Where&#39;s the princess of the New Moon!?&quot; 

Usagi grabbed Naru&#39;s hand and drug her up, yelling at her to run. The 
two ran from the youma, praying to any good that would listen to their 
pleas of help.

~All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I&#39;ll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I&#39;ll see you again~

&quot;Slow night,&quot; Makoto said as she and Yung Hu in his tiger form sat 
atop of a building.

&quot;Hai,&quot; he agreed.

They sat in silence longer, pondering their own thoughts.

&quot;Talk to the guardians lately,&quot; Makoto asked, turning her head to look 
skyward.

&quot;Hai,&quot; Yung Hu answered. &quot;Today, in fact.&quot;

&quot;Whats up with those two?&quot;

&quot;Nothing much. They are just on slight vacation with their wards. 
Doing like me and keeping an eye out for possiable danger.&quot;

Makoto nodded. &quot;Tell them about me yet?&quot;

&quot;Iie. Best not to, I think.&quot;

Makoto nodded again, and this time remained silent.

Yung Hu glanced at her sideways, then his eyes averted forward once 
again. &quot;Artemis says Minko is doing fine.&quot;

Makoto remained silent.

&quot;Maybe you should find a way to talk to her,&quot; he said. &quot;I know you 
miss her.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s happier with out me.&quot;

Yung Hu glanced at Makoto once again. &quot;Only because she doesn&#39;t 
remeber what you two had. If you could find a way back into her life-&quot;

&quot;I said NO!&quot; Makoto said, glaring at her guardian. She blinked and 
shook her head. &quot;Gomen.&quot;

&quot;No need for you to be,&quot; Yung Hu said, smiling gently. &quot;I ju-&quot;

&quot;&#39;Just worry about me and my happiness&#39;. Hai, I know.&quot;

Yung Hu smiled more, but said nothing.

Sighing, Makoto stood. &quot;Ready to go home? We haven&#39;t seen the UFO nor 
any youm-&quot;

Makoto and Yung Hu jerked their heads towards a scream as it broke 
thru the silence. 

&quot;Nevermind...&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Usagi and Naru had gotten themselves cornored in a dead end alley. 
Their backs against the wall, they clung to each other out of fear, 
the youma still chanting demandingly.

&quot;Where&#39;s the princess of the New Moon!?&quot;

&quot;Jupiter Thunder...CRASH!&quot;

The youma screamed in pain as the force collieded with its back. It 
slouched forward, falling to its hands and knees.

Usagi and Naru ran forward to escape before the youma stood back up. 
Howevere, Naru hesiated after Usagi. The youma stood and turned just 
as she ran past, throwing one of its arms out hitting her in the back. 
She flew forward ten feet, hitting her head on a wall and falling down 
to the ground, not moving.

Usagi ran to her, wondering if she was still alive. But she never made 
it. The youma grabbed her by the throat, holding her above her head. 
Usagi kept hold of the youma&#39;s wrsit, kicking and screaming for help, 
tears flowing down her face.

Usagi prayed when she died, it would be quick. Not only for her, but 
also for Naru who layed helpless in the street. She closed her eyes 
tightly, the tears flowing harder.

Then she fell.

On impact, she cried out, then opened her eyes. In front of her, she 
saw a female warrior cad in a short skirted out fit that reminded her 
of a sailor&#39;s fuku. Next to the woman was a large blue tiger, helping 
her.

Jupiter shot out attacks at the youma. However this creature was much 
stronger then any she had ever seen before. In her heart she knew she 
and Yung Hu would need Sailor Moon&#39;s help.

&quot;Usagi! You have to help them!&quot;

Usagi blinked and turned toward the voice screaming at her. But she 
saw no one nor nothing other than her black cat Luna.

&quot;Usagi! Help her!&quot;

Usagi blinked again. Her cat was speaking to her! I must have bonked 
my head with me knowing about it, Usagi thought to herself.

Luna ran to Usagi, then to Jupiter and Yung Hu before concentrating on 
Usagi once again. &quot;You have to help,&quot; Luna yelled again, frantic now 
that Jupiter and Yung Hu ere turning back slightly from the more 
powerful youma.

&quot;You can talk,&quot; Usagi exclaimed.

&quot;No time for that! You have to remeber, Usagi,&quot; Luna yelled at her 
ward once again. With out waiting for another interuption, Luna&#39;s 
cresent moon shot forward a beam that collided with Usagi&#39;s head....

~I&#39;ve searched through time
I&#39;ve always known
That you were there upon your throne
A lonely queen without her king
I&#39;ve longed for you my love forever~

Juiter hit the wall roughly as the youma shot its power at her. She 
slumped forward, her breathing hard and shallow. Blood dripped from 
her mouth and her left arm ached. She was almost positive it was 
broken.

She heard an animalistic scream and dared to look up. What she saw was 
Yung Hu being flung forward roughly, hitting the same wall Naru had 
only minutes before. He too being knocked out cold. Jupiter struggled 
to stand, useing the wall behind her for support.

The youma turned slowly to face her, and Jupiter&#39;s blood ran cold. She 
was extremly tired and sore, but could not stop fighting. Not until 
she was dead.

The youma took one step toward her before being hit with a flying disk 
from the side. The golden disk cut the youma in half, making him turn 
to dust instantly. All that was left of him was a small stone with a 
black cresent moon that pointed down in the middle of it...

Jupiter blinked and slowly turned her head to see Sailor Moon standing 
there, waiting for the disk to return to her. She caught it when it 
did, slowly replacaing the disk on her brow, it now in its original 
form, her tiara. Sailor Moon then smiled up at Jupiter, who greatly 
returned the smile before falling over on herleft side, darkness 
surrounding her.

~All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I&#39;ll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I&#39;ll see you again~ </pre>
