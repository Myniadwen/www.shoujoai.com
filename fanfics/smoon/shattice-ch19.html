<h1>Super Sailor Mercury: Shattered Ice (part 19 of 34)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/shattice-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>Haruka Tenoh raced along the outside of the building,
the sandy haired blonde pulling out her transformation
wand as she did so. Screams echoed off in the distance
as she raised the stick, crying out, &quot;Uranus Planet
Power, make up!&quot;

In seconds Sailor Uranus stood ready, even as Sailor
Neptune ran up to her as well. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; the
green haired woman asked, her eyes worried.

&quot;Don&#39;t know yet,&quot; Uranus said crisply as they ran on
towards the sports fields. They came around a corner
then skidded to a stop, blinking in pure surprise.

The muscular guy dressed in a sailor fuku leapt up,
clenching his fists as he gestured, &quot;Youth sweat
attack!&quot; The thick gobs of fluid loudly splashed to
the ground, the grass and stone around them actually
begining to dissolve away.

&quot;Ewww,&quot; Neptune grimaced even as they leapt back.

&quot;What the hell...?&quot; Uranus shook her head.

There was a flash of movement and Sailor Mercury
droped to their side, the young woman looking focused
and intent. &quot;Good timing,&quot; she flashed them a smile
before continuing, &quot;he calls himself Sailor Guts, I
think.&quot;

Then they saw something that made both Uranus and
Neptune stiffen again, this time in alarm. Three
figures leapt up, dodging Guts&#39; attacks with grace and
speed, garbed in all black leather. The bikini tops
and bottons gleamed against healthy skin, the
star-wing emblems each wore quite destinctive. A black
haired young lady seemed to be leading them, followed
by a redish brown and white haired pair of women.

&quot;That&#39;s the mysterious senshi you met a few days ago?&quot;
Nepture asked intently, her eyes oddly dangerous.

&quot;Yes, Sailor Star Fighter.&quot; Mercury nodded. She smiled
grimly, knowing how the two would react as she said,
&quot;We&#39;re going to back them up.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re clearly not senshi from our solar system,&quot;
Uranus quickly protested, &quot;they could easily be
enemies!&quot;

&quot;The enemy of my enemy is my ally,&quot; Mercury met
Uranus&#39; eyes, her own expression utterly unyeilding.

&quot;And so she becomes a leader,&quot; Neptune murmured
softly.

&quot;Star serious laser!&quot; the black haired woman cried
out, Sailor Star Fighter firing a lance of energy to
drive their foe backwards.

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Mercury lead the charge forward, her
thoughts racing as she considered what to do next.
Cupping her hands she called on an older attack,
&quot;Mercury ice bubbles blast!&quot; As a white fog engulfed
the battle field Uranus and Neptune folowed up, firing
their attacks at the now confused adversary, badly
throwing him off balance.

The two other leather clad figures looked almost as
confused, but their leader had a strangely expectant
look on her face. &quot;Now, Sailor Mercury,&quot; Sailor Star
Fighter cried.

&quot;What...?&quot; Uranus looked confused.

Raising her sword Mercury&#39;s crystal locket blazed then
she held a scepter in her hands, one that gleamed
purest silver, decorated with a ruby, emerald, diamond
and a crescent moon. The blue cloak that had been
added to her costume swirled around her as she raised
it, watching as Sailor Guts staggered to his feet,
power and cold swirling around the weapon. She pointed
it and declared, &quot;Mercury Freezing Restoration!&quot;

&quot;Guts!&quot; he cried out then was completely encased in a
wave of pure ice. In less than a second it shattered,
the football player collapsing bonelessly to the
ground, the shining jewel fading away as it returned
to him.

&quot;Incredible,&quot; Neptune murmured softly.

&quot;Wait,&quot; Mercury cried as her costume shifted back to
normal, the three Star Senshi about to leave the
battlefield without a goodbye.

The other two women looked to Star Fighter, who looked
back at the three Sailor Senshi thoughtfully, her gaze
lingering a moment on Sailor Mercury. &quot;Yes?&quot; she
asked, the slightest of smiles on her handsome face.

&quot;Thank you for your help,&quot; Mercury said. She
introduced herself then Uranus and Neptune before
asking, &quot;Where did you come from?&quot;

&quot;Star Fighter,&quot; she gestured to her taller brown
haired companion, &quot;Star Maker,&quot; then to the smaller
white haired woman, &quot;and Star Healer.&quot; She smiled
grimly, &quot;I can&#39;t tell you where we come from, but it
seems we share a common enemy.&quot;

&quot;I noticed,&quot; Uranus said, looking at her with a
suspicious glare.

&quot;We need to go,&quot; Maker reminded them firmly.

With that the three women leapt away but not before
Fighter turned to say with a grin, &quot;We&#39;ll meet again,
senshi.&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Mercury cursed softly, tempted to chase after
them. Still, classes were on and they all needed to
get back to school.

&quot;We&#39;d better get back,&quot; Neptune said what they were
all thinking as she lead the way, shifting back into
Michiru as they went.

&quot;Wish Setsuna had been there,&quot; Haruka commented as
they went inside the school to report latre to their
classes, &quot;I&#39;d love to know her opinion.&quot;

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Ami admitted, She stoped I front of her
class door, tiding her uniform as she met their eyes,
&quot;Meet you at your house after school?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll see you there,&quot; Michiru waved as they hurried
off.

Ami was about to open the door when she heard running
footsteps coming up the long hall towards her. Seiya,
Yaten and Taiki all stumbled to a stop in front of the
door, the three brothers looking somewhat out of
breath. &quot;You&#39;re late too, Mizuno-san?&quot; Taiki asked her
wryly, his brown hair swept back from his face.

&quot;Some friends occupied me a little too long,&quot; Ami
answered with a half-truth.

&quot;If someone hadn&#39;t dawdled,&quot; Yaten gave Seiya a look,
&quot;we&#39;d have been here sooner.&quot;

&quot;It would have been rude to leave so suddenly,&quot; Seiya
protested.

&quot;The fact that it was a pretty girl you were talking
to had nothing to do with it,&quot; Taiki noted dryly,
looking deliberately innocent.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Seiya protested.

The door slid open and the teacher looked out, his
expression faintly disaproving. &quot;Dawdling out in the
hallway?&quot; he frowned. His eyes widened as he noticed
Ami standing with the three boys, &quot;And Miss Mizuno,
I&#39;m shocked.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Ami half bowed, silently cursing her luck.

A few moments later she and the Three Lights were all
lined up in the hall, holding full buckets of water in
each hand. Seiya spoke up in the near silence, &quot;I&#39;m
really sorry.&quot;

Ami didn&#39;t answer, she just clenched her jaw in
discomfort. &quot;I don&#39;t think she really wants to hear
that,&quot; Taiki said softly.

&quot;It&#39;s not our fault the teacher&#39;s a sadist,&quot; Yaten
murmured, &quot;I didn&#39;t even think they still did this to
students.&quot;

Ami sighed, &quot;I think they save it for special
occassions.&quot; She gave all of them fierce looks, &quot;And
be quiet, or he&#39;ll tack another period of us doing
this on.&quot;

&quot;Please no,&quot; Seiya whimpered.

Setsuna strode up the hall, only to slow as she gazed
at them in pure surprise. &quot;What happened?&quot; she asked
Ami softly, concern in her voice.

&quot;Don&#39;t ask,&quot; Ami said wearily.

&quot;It was our fault, Meiou-sensei,&quot; Taiki said
gentlemanly.

&quot;More like mine,&quot; Seiya shrugged, wincing at the
weight of the buckets.</pre>
