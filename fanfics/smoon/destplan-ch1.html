<h1>Destiny's Plan</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ydesabrais.html">Yohann DeSabrais</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The song of birds outside the window gently stirred Hotaru from her
light sleep. She felt a throbbing headache as she usually did in the
morning, inevitable consequence of the difficulty she always had in
getting a good night&#39;s sleep. Between the poor health and the bad
dreams induced by her traumatic past, peaceful slumber was little
more than wishful thinking for her.

Then something made her smile. Turning her head to the side, she
saw the huddled figure of the most beautiful woman in the world.
She had a gentle smile on her face as her sleepy mind wandered in
some delicious dream only she knew about. Her long locks of silky
pink hair were strewn about on the mattress like long rivers of
the purest water. Hotaru looked at her with a smile, thinking that
even if her sleep was to be torture for the rest of her life, her
waking moments of heaven with Chibi-Usa would be more than enough
to make her happy about her existence.

A sparkle around Chibi-Usa`s finger caught her attention, another
identical glimpse glittering around her own finger. Two golden rings
symbolizing their undying love for each other as well as their mutual
promise to hold and protect that love always.

Hotaru brushed softly Chibi-Usa`s face with her hand, eliciting a
gentle smile and a sigh of content from her sleeping lover.

&quot;You&#39;re so beautiful, Chibi, whatever did I do to deserve your
love, my precious one?&quot; she whispered.

Chibi-Usa chose this moment to open her eyes and take Hotaru&#39;s hand
in her own.

&quot;You filled a void in my heart I didn&#39;t even know was there until
I met you.&quot; she said, smiling.

&quot;How long have you been awake, Chibi?&quot; asked Hotaru as she moved
closer to Chibi-Usa and cuddled to her, placing her arms around her
and feeling the gentle warmth of her naked flesh.

&quot;Long enough to hear your words and feel your touch.&quot; she replied
just before placing a tender kiss on her cheek.

Hotaru sighed when she felt Chibi-Usa`s hands caress her body. If 
there was any better way in this world to wake up every morning,
she didn&#39;t want to know what it was. The dark haired girl wanted
to hear nothing that could lessen the wondrous bliss that was the
love of her dream girl.

Chibi-Usa could see how much Hotaru was enjoying her caresses. It
made her feel good to see her lover smile, and she knew every
way that Hotaru liked being touched, every single spot of her skin
that responded to the touch of her lips... every little way to
tantalize her senses and make her reach heaven.

Moving her lips to Hotaru&#39;s neck, she kissed the satin skin of her
beautiful lover while her slender hand made its way to her perfect
breasts, her fingers teasing her small nipple until it became
hard under her touch.

&quot;You like this?&quot; Chibi-Usa asked softly, knowing the answer from
the way Hotaru&#39;s breathing was getting deeper and louder.

&quot;Yes... that feels so good...&quot; Hotaru replied, her eyes closed as
she licked her lips in delight.

&quot;I&#39;m happy you like it...&quot; whispered Chibi-Usa as her fingers
pinched and pulled gently on her nipple, each little flick creating
a small spark of pleasure in her body. Hotaru hands grew more
fidgety, and she ran her fingers through the long pink hair of
her lover as her mouth moved to her chest and began sucking on her
flesh mounds.

&quot;Ooooh, yes... I love you Chibi...&quot; she moaned as Chibi-Usa`s
tongue flicked on her hard nipples, twisting around in circles.

The pink haired girl was in heaven as well. There was nothing
more delicious to her than the sweet taste of Hotaru&#39;s flawless
skin, except the thought of all the pleasure she was giving her.
While she licked her, she moved her hand down to her stomach,
rubbing tenderly as she made her way to Hotaru&#39;s most sensitive
spot.

The dark haired girl suddenly opened her eyes and tried to let
out a yelp of surprise, but her voice was silenced by the sudden
jolt of pleasure she felt as Chibi-Usa`s slender fingers caressed
the moist folds of her secret garden. She breathed faster, her
body shaking in delight.

&quot;Oh yes, please don&#39;t stop my goddess!&quot; whispered Hotaru. She felt
like every nerve in her body was being overloaded with electricity,
threatening to push her over the edge, but at the same time she
wanted nothing else but plunge over that edge into the deep end.

Sensing that her lover was ready, Chibi-Usa moved her lips away
from her breasts, but only to move them lower and give Hotaru the
most intimate and delicious kiss two lovers can share. As her
tongue touched Hotaru&#39;s wet outer lips, the dark haired girl 
cringed her teeth to try and keep herself from screaming out loud.

The fire in her womanhood grew even hotter as she felt Chibi-Usa`s
tongue darting inside her, reaching as deep as it could and 
prodding her inner mysteries with all the love that the pink haired
girl had for her. She grinded her hips in her face as she felt the
pleasure intensify even further, like her whole body was reaching
critical mass.

When Chibi-Usa finally decided to go for the kill and grabbed her
precious jewel in between her lips, it was to much to bear and she
exploded in a massive orgasm that even the senshi of death didn&#39;t
have the strength to resist, her throat letting out a loud and
vibrant yell. As the scream died, her body released the strangle
hold over her mind, Hotaru once again in possession of her ability
to move on her own free will. Her desires had been satisfied and
her hunger for Chibi-Usa`s body sated... for now at least.

&quot;I love you, Chibi. I would die for you... again.&quot; she said,
kissing her lover and tasting her own honey on Chibi-Usa`s lips.

&quot;I love you more than anyone or anything, Hotaru. I know now that
it was destiny to get us together in the end...&quot; said Chibi-Usa,
smiling. &quot;I&#39;m hungry!&quot; she added.

&quot;Of course you are! Let&#39;s take care of that, then!&quot; offered Hotaru.
