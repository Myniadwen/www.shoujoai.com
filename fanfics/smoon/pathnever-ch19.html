<p><strong><u></u></strong><em>‘Got  up this morning<br />
  On the right side of my bed<br />
  With all these  crazy thoughts<br />
  Screaming though my head…’</em></p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s  POV, Michiru’s House, Morning</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Wake up Kaiya. It’s  morning.” I felt someone prod me.</p>
<p><strong>Nudge nudge.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In response I rolled over, turning my back away from  whoever it was trying to disturb my sleep. It was probably Haruka or  Michiru…</p>
<p>“WAKE UP.” The voice bordered exasperation now.  Two hands gripped down on my shoulder and pushed me hard.</p>
<p>“Go  away Haruka.” I mumbled as I lazily tried to swat the hands  off.</p>
<p>“…I’m not Haruka.”</p>
<p>“Michiru?”</p>
<p>“Not  even close.” Whoever it was, they sure sounded annoyed now. “You’re  doing this in spite of me aren’t you?”</p>
<p>But…who else  could it be? I really had no idea.</p>
<p>“Mmmmm…?” Through  bleary eyes I looked up, willing them to adjust to the light level.  As the picture came into focus, I remember thinking that the person  had really long hair. REALLY long hair. Which meant that it wasn’t  Haruka or Michiru after all. Besides, I’d doubt Haruka would have  let me sleep and ignore her this long without her start some sort of  wrestling match. And Michiru would’ve probably laughed at me if  anything. I blinked again as the figure came into focus. Crimson  eyes? I snapped awake. “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!”</p>
<p><strong>WHOOOOSH</strong></p>
<p><strong>THUD!  THUD! THUD! THUD!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Haruka came barreling into the room as I  was on my way out. “What’s going on-“</p>
<p><strong>WHAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Oof!”  We both fell over. “Kaiya what the hell is wrong with you? You’re  going to wake the baby!”</p>
<p>“T-t-t-there’s a s-stranger in  the house.”</p>
<p>“A stranger?” Haruka repeated my words,  seemingly shocked by my own surprised state. She blinked and then  looked up at the tall figure standing directly behind me now.</p>
<p>“Is  she like this every morning Haruka?” The ‘stranger’ asked.  There was a touch of amusement lacing her words as she said  this.</p>
<p>Sighing, Haruka had somehow pried me off of her and  calmly explained to me, “Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten Setsuna  already! You know, Sailor Pluto? Keeper of time? Gorgeous-”</p>
<p>“You  can stop right there, I think she gets the picture.” Setsuna cut  in.</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am…”</p>
<p>I slowly turned  around and stood up to take a good look at Pluto. She looked very  different from all the other times I’ve seen her. For one, this  must have been the first time I’ve seen her without her Sailor fuku  in real life. That one time in the vision didn’t count.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, I admit that I’ve forgotten that she was staying  with Haruka and Michiru.</p>
<p>Meioh Setsuna…My memory  came back to me.</p>
<p>“So you’re going to be Hotaru’s third  parent?”</p>
<p>“That is correct.”</p>
<p>“A mom or a  dad?”</p>
<p>“Second mother. Haruka is playing the  ‘father’.”</p>
<p>“So…do I call you Aunt Setsuna? Or do I  get a third parent too?”</p>
<p>There was an awkward  silence. The look on the keeper of time’s face was hilarious! It  was just screaming ‘OH KAMI, ANOTHER KID?’</p>
<p>“Kaiya, I  don’t think Setsuna would want to be related to you.” Haruka  finally mumbled.</p>
<p>“What’s that supposed to mean? If she’s  Hotaru’s mom too, then she’d have closer relation ties to you. If  anything, I think that’d be more torturous!”</p>
<p>“Why  you…”</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, you might wake the baby.” I grinned.  Haruka dropped the thought of fighting immediately with horror to  what Michiru may do if the unthinkable did occur. Instead, the tall  blonde glared, probably thinking along the lines of ‘I’ll get you  for this.’</p>
<p>Heh…</p>
<p>“Erm, either one is fine Kaiya.  I’ll leave it up to you.” Setsuna finally replied.</p>
<p>“Yay!  So I get another mom! Or can I trade Haruka for you to be my  dad?”</p>
<p>“KAIYA…” The taller blonde fumed behind  me.</p>
<p>Before I could argue back we all suddenly heard a,  “Waaaaaah! Waaaaah!”</p>
<p>Uh oh.</p>
<p>Haruka, Setsuna and I all exchanged glances.</p>
<p><strong>Tup, tup,  tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>A very annoyed looking Michiru stared at our trio  from the doorway. Did I ever mention that Michiru wasn’t a morning  person? “Who woke the baby?” Her voice was sweet as usual…  Which would have fooled anyone if they hadn’t seen that murderous  glint in her eyes.</p>
<p>Without thinking Setsuna and I pointed to  Haruka. “She did it.”</p>
<p>“Haruka…” Michiru slowly  walked forward.</p>
<p>“W-wait. I-it wasn’t my faul- well, okay,  maybe a little but I mean…Eep.”</p>
<p>“Setsuna, will you  please care for Hotaru for a minute?” The aqua haired woman handed  the baby girl over to the green haired woman before the other party  could protest. In a way, why would Setsuna even THINK of saying  ‘no’?</p>
<p>With the baby in one arm and me in the other,  Setsuna quickly pulled us out of the room muttering, “…not  something children should see…”</p>
<p><strong>WHACK! KAPOW!  WHAM!</strong></p>
<p><u>Outside of Rei’s Place</u></p>
<p><em>‘I  can’t wait to see<br />
  What this world holds for me.<br />
  Oh, it’s a  new day<br />
  Oh, it’s a new day’</em></p>
<p>Setsuna and I  calmed Michiru down enough to let Haruka live…And it was no easy  task! Believe me. I never knew Michiru in the morning could be that  violent! It must have something to do with becoming a mother of two,  overnight.</p>
<p>It was scary yet it had to be done. Today  everyone was going to meet at Rei’s place before we all head out to  the park grounds for Family Day. That meant Ami, Rei, Makoto, Minako,  Usagi, Chibi-Usa, Mamoru and well, you get the idea. We’re all  going to be there. Their families are going to be there too but we  all agreed to spend the second half of the day together as a group of  friends. Or I should say as the Sailor Senshi family in Michiru’s  terms.</p>
<p>The thought excited me. It was going to be my  first time being with a group of friends and my parents for something  like this! But I’m also a bit nervous. Not only will I get to see  everyone today for the first time since that crazy fight, but today  was also the day Haruka, Michiru and I would do that scheduled  performance at the event. I wonder how many people will be there…I  hope I don’t screw up my parts. We did lose a few practices due to  ‘technical complications’ after all.</p>
<p>“Kaiya! You. Are.  Late!” I heard Rei roar as we arrived.</p>
<p>“Don’t look at  me. I didn’t drive. Haruka-”</p>
<p>I paused when I  noticed all of the younger girls staring at me. Rei had stopped  screaming as well, adopting that same expression the others had.  Usagi, Minako, Rei, Makoto, Chibi-Usa and even Ami were giving me  this weird, spaced out expression.</p>
<p>“Guys? Is… there  something on my face?” through the corner of my eye I noticed my  parents giving each other a thoughtful expression before a grin lit  their faces. That wasn’t a good sign.</p>
<p>“Aw, look. They  missed you.” Haruka whispered to me. “So why don't you go say  HELLO?”</p>
<p>“EH?”</p>
<p><strong>Boot!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> I  fell forward into the group of younger girls thinking, <em>hugs  everywhere! I’m doooooooomed!<br />
</em></p>
<p>“Heh heh heh,  revenge is sweet.” The tall blonde chuckled, making Setsuna step  back warily. “And don’t think you’re getting away either  Setsuna!”</p>
<p><u>Family Day site, Stage</u></p>
<p>The park when we got there was absolutely packed! There were families  everywhere. People were having picnics all over the place- on the  grass, up on the hills, under the trees in the shade and by the park  but mostly beside the stage.</p>
<p>Seeing so many faces  at once nearly put me into a state of shock. Not because the sheer  number specifically but because everyone was happy and enjoying  themselves. Not to mention, the weather was amazing as well! It was  no doubt boosting the people’s moral.</p>
<p>“Introducing the  Tenoh family!” The announcer boomed over the speaker. A thunderous  sound of claps could be heard following our introduction.</p>
<p>Haruka had changed our name over the phone this morning with  Michiru’s full approval. Although many people wouldn’t understand  the meaning to that name, at least some of us did. And it was  important to all of us. Speaking of family, Haruka got her revenge on  Setsuna by having the new mother take over baby duty for the entire  performance. ALONE. In fact, I could see the two sitting up front  along with the entire gang!</p>
<p><em>‘Any time or any place<br />
  You  are the reason<br />
  For the smile on my face’</em></p>
<p>“Ready  Kaiya?” I felt Haruka and Michiru hold my shoulders. Their gesture  greatly eased the butterflies in my stomach.</p>
<p><em>‘’Cause  you make me feel<br />
  All my dreams can be real’</em></p>
<p>“Yup!”</p>
<p><u> Performance Starts</u></p>
<p><u></u> Everything went going off  without a hitch.</p>
<p>To all of our surprise, the entire show went  throughout the first part of the day. So afterwards all of us got  together and headed over to take a look at the booths in the park’s  center. It was like another festival. There were booths selling food,  some hosted carnival games, others had fortune-tellers and pretty  much everything else that you could think of.</p>
<p>Of  course Haruka and Mamoru managed to win a gazillion plushies for  everyone. Surprisingly enough, Michiru also won me something too. She  said it was for giving her my bear earlier.</p>
<p>And as  usual, Usagi and Rei got into another fight… this time it was at  the goldfish catching place though.</p>
<p>“You never listen to me!  You have to do it like this Odango!”</p>
<p>“But REEEEEI, I want  to do it myself!”</p>
<p>Couldn’t they ever get along?<br />
  <em><br />
    ‘Oh,  it’s a new day<br />
    Oh, it’s a new day’</em></p>
<p>Makoto and Ami also entered together in a baking contest.</p>
<p>We all went to watch except for Rei and Usagi who still were  bickering about how to catch a goldfish.</p>
<p><u>Baking contest</u></p>
<p><u></u> Ami and Makoto were at one counter trying to chocolate chip  cookies.</p>
<p>“2 cups of flour? Do you think that’s enough  Makoto?” Ami asked her partner, looking up from the cookbook for a  second.</p>
<p>“Of course.” The chestnut haired girl mixed the  ingredient in and stirred the entire batter together thoroughly.  “These people take a lot of care and time to make these recipes. It  really takes a lot of heart if they want to cook. Or I think so  anyway.”</p>
<p>“Makoto…”</p>
<p>“Besides! If all else  fails, you taste it!” She held out a spoon with some of the  chocolate batter on it to Ami.</p>
<p>Ami’s cheeks turned bright  pink as she took a taste, although I wasn’t sure if that was the  only reason. “I-it’s very good.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you like  it!” Makoto beamed.<br />
  <em><br />
    ‘It feels so good to be alive<br />
    Even  if a little rain should fall’</em></p>
<p>Somehow both  Usagi (with fish in hand) and Rei arrived in time to catch the end of  the contest as Makoto and Ami won first place. Too bad we didn’t  stay around long, because Rei immediately dragged me off to  participate in some archery contest with her. Or to be more  precise…against her. (She knows I’m not good at it!)</p>
<p><u>Archery  Contest</u></p>
<p><u></u><strong>Zing!</strong><u></u></p>
<p><u></u>“Hino Rei takes  first!” The announcer boomed.</p>
<p>For awhile there, I  actually was able to keep up. Somehow I managed to pick up most of  Rei’s technique by watching her and then stumbled through the other  novice’s with luck (actually they were all novices except Rei and  this other guy). I made it to the top three and then got knocked out  before Rei took out the poor guy out. He never stood a  chance.</p>
<p>“Whew…”</p>
<p>As I walked off to get  a drink of water, I saw a color of blonde and a red bow hiding behind  a tree.</p>
<p>“Minako?” I tapped the shorter girl on the  shoulder.</p>
<p>She nearly jumped out of her socks and nearly  startled me in the process. “W-What?” She stammered.</p>
<p>My  eyes trailed from her face down to her hands where she held a small  box. It was decorated in red wrapping paper and it had an unique  touch of having a red bow on it, similar to Minako’s own.</p>
<p>“Rei’s  still a little busy receiving her award, but I can tell her to meet  you here if you like.” I offered.</p>
<p>“Hey, it’s not like  I’m waiting for her or anything.” The girl turned her head and  pouted.</p>
<p>She can’t fool me. “Great, then I’ll tell her to  meet you here in five. Good luck.” I patted her on the shoulder as  I turned to walk back.</p>
<p>Minako turned a deep shade of red with  embarrassment and then yelled, “Kaiya!”</p>
<p>As I  said I’d do, I found Rei and told her just that. The fiery tempered  miko looked very confused as to ‘why’ I told her to wander over  to the tree backstage but at least she didn’t argue. All she needed  to know was that she’d get a surprise. I didn’t say what though,  that was a secret.</p>
<p>Rei wandered to where I told her to, still  shaking her head as she wondered what was going on. “Mina-chan?”  She had spotted the other girl.</p>
<p>“Hi Rei chan. I-I wanted to  give you something.”</p>
<p><em>‘’Cause every moment<br />
  Bring a  new surprise to us all’</em></p>
<p>Rei opened the box, her eyes  going wide with surprise. “Mina chan…do you really…?”</p>
<p>The young blonde gave a small definite nodded and then  continued to look down, blushing. Yet she was so caught up into her  own state of embarrassment that she was tackled to the ground by  Rei’s embrace. For awhile, the two of them held each other, crying  tears of happiness.</p>
<p><u>Flashback of the group hug earlier</u></p>
<p>“No, Usagi, I didn’t bring you any food. Sorry.” I  sweat dropped seeing her puppy dog expression.</p>
<p>“That’s all  right. I’m just glad you’re back with us!”</p>
<p><em>‘Oh,  it’s a new day’</em></p>
<p>“Kaiya, you’re such an idiot! You  think you can just disappear without telling me?” Rei  screamed.</p>
<p>“Rei means that she missed you.” Usagi  translated in a cheerful voice.</p>
<p>“Since when do you know what  I’m thinking Odango? Do you read minds too?” The fire senshi  snapped at her friend.</p>
<p>“You’re so mean Rei!”</p>
<p>“Oh  no, those fake tears won’t work this time!”</p>
<p>Oh jeez…</p>
<p><em>‘Oh,  it’s a new day’</em></p>
<p>“It’s good to see you again.”  Makoto gave me a hug as well. As tall as I was, Makoto still felt a  lot stronger than me.</p>
<p>“So we have to have another match  sometime right?” I asked.</p>
<p>“You bet. I’ll take you on  anytime.”</p>
<p><em>‘Oh, it’s a new day’</em></p>
<p>“GOTCHA!”  Minako leapt up and tackled me from behind.</p>
<p>“Hi there. So,  you are going to ask her today right?” I whispered.</p>
<p>“I  don’t know what you’re talking about!” She squealed as her face  turned bright red.</p>
<p><em>‘Oh, it’s a new day’</em></p>
<p> Ami stood back, looking a little nervous after Minako’s  entrance.</p>
<p>“Hi Ami.” I walked up and gave the timid girl a  hug. It took her another few seconds to hug me back. I knew people  like Ami tend to keep to themselves and stand around instead of  joining the group so I hugged her instead of waiting.</p>
<p>“I’m  glad you’re back.” She finally replied.</p>
<p>“Me  too.”</p>
<p><u>Music Performance end</u></p>
<p><u></u><strong>CLAP!  CLAP! CLAP! CLAP! CLAP! CLAP!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><br />
  <u>Park playground</u></p>
<p><u></u> Spending the day with everyone was the best time I ever had.  It was fun. I got to try out a lot of things and got to know people  even better. The best part though, was spending time with Michiru,  Haruka, Setsuna and Hotaru. We did a lot of stuff together with the  group and outside of the group. Like right now, Michiru was watching  Haruka attempt to make a sand castle.</p>
<p>Only…It was  too bad that everything has to come to an end.</p>
<p>Setsuna walked  up to me from Michiru’s side and bent down to quietly whisper, “Are  you ready to go?”</p>
<p>“Yeah…”</p>
<p>Setsuna let  me stay this one day with everyone for a final time before she would  take me back. Things back at home were really on the edge I heard.  But I was still happy I was allowed this one chance.</p>
<p><u>Outside  park limits, away from the crowds, late afternoon/early  evening</u></p>
<p><u></u><strong>FLAAAAASH</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> The time portal  opened up at the guardian of time’s command.</p>
<p>“Are you sure  you do not want to say goodbye to them?” I heard the tall woman  say.</p>
<p>I wanted to but I couldn’t. “I…I don’t think it  would be a good idea.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>Because I’ll cry.</p>
<p><strong>Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Kaiya!  W-wait up!” Haruka had somehow caught up to us. She was panting  heavily as she came to a slow. Michiru was right behind her with  Hotaru in her arms. “Where are you going?”</p>
<p>I  knew they couldn't come back with me. Because of their decision they  were stuck here to live everything all over again… Besides, once I  leave Pluto would probably use those memory seals on them again. Who  knows if they’ll remember me after I leave? It would’ve save us  all a lot of trouble and emotional stress if they hadn’t  came.</p>
<p>“Home.”</p>
<p>“Right now?” Michiru looked  surprised.</p>
<p>I nodded. “There’s something I have to take  care of. Something only I can do. I wish I could stay longer, I  really do but I can’t. I’m sorry…Haruka?”</p>
<p>Haruka silently walked to up to me before embracing me in a tight  hug. Right on contact I could feel her emotions. They were raging,  torn between regret and sadness. But she was strong, I know she would  be all right after I leave.</p>
<p>“You better take care of  yourself. If you have any trouble, you can call for Setsuna. Please  take care of her.” The tall blonde addressed Pluto.</p>
<p>“I  will.”</p>
<p>Michiru handed Hotaru to Haruka before  embracing me as well. I noticed she was gentler than her ‘husband’.  From what I felt from her, she could cry at any moment.</p>
<p>“We’ll  miss you.” She whispered softly. “Don’t forget your bear.”</p>
<p>I  took the plushie Michiru had won for me from her hands. I had almost  forgotten it, trying to leave as soon as possible. “I know. I’ll  miss everyone too, especially you guys. Hotaru as well.”</p>
<p>I looked over to the baby girl. She was wide-awake to my  surprise. I walked up and held out a finger to her small open palm  and in turn she gently grasped it. It made me wish that I could be  here to watch her grow up.</p>
<p>But…that’s not meant to be  either.</p>
<p>Gently I pull my hand away and then stepped back to  Pluto’s side. So that means I’ll just have to try to be there for  her more in the future!</p>
<p>I felt Pluto take my hand  gave me a small tug towards the portal. I knew it would not last much  longer.</p>
<p>As I was about to step in, I turned around to tell my  parents one last thing. “Mom! Dad!” I watched as they both cried  freely now. I was able to find them after all this time. To see them  and myself grow as we became friends and then eventually best  friends. Everything we’ve been through taught me so much.  Especially one thing in particular…that I didn’t hate them.  Despite my own tears and all of our hardships, I was finally able to  say, “I…love you guys too.”</p>
<p><strong>FLAAAAAAASH</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>‘Here  in you I found a friend<br />
  You’ll be with me till the  end’</em></p>
<p><u>Haruka’s POV, one week later, sitting  together in the park, sunset</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Has your headache  disappeared yet Ruka?” Michiru worriedly asked me.</p>
<p>For the last week, oddly enough the both of us had these mild  headaches that just wouldn’t go away! Michi had only recovered from  hers recently though.</p>
<p>“For the most part, I suppose so.  Still…I sometimes get these images. Setsuna said it was normal  though, although she never explained why it was normal for people to  get sudden headaches for an entire week.”</p>
<p>“I heard her  speaking to herself the other day about time being put on the right  track again. Do you know what she meant by that?”</p>
<p>“Nope.  But you know Sets, she tends to be a perfectionist when it comes to  time. It could be anything.”</p>
<p>“…Speaking of which…Ruka,  do you remember anything…unusual?”</p>
<p>“Like a blonde brat  with aqua eyes?”</p>
<p>Michi’s eyes widened momentarily before I  pulled her closer into me. “Something like that.” She smiled and  gave a content sigh.</p>
<p>Like I could forget. I doubt  any of us could.</p>
<p>“I’m sure…we’ll meet her again  someday.”</p>
