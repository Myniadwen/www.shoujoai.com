<h1>Someone to Call My Lover</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nelly.html">The Almighty Nelly</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&#147;Michiru-chan!&#148; a voice called to the young aqua-haired sea-maiden 
&#147;Where are you going?&#148; The girl looked back, deep green eyes flashing 
with anger, tears threatening to fall.

&#147;I&#146;m leaving Kyoko! I&#146;ve had it with you and your late night outings!&#148; 
yelled the young girl. Tossing her suitcase into her blue beetle, she 
hopped into the driver&#146;s seat. Kyoko looked on, her deep brown eyes 
looking distressed.

&#147;You can&#146;t mean that Michiru&#133; I love you&#133;&#148; Kyoko said, despair obvious 
in her voice. A tanned hand reached out towards the beetle, but it 
already had driven away. &#147;What have I done?&#148; she whispered, tears 
streaming freely down her face.

Back on the road again
Feelin&#146; kinda lonely
And looking for the right gal
To be mine

Michiru sighed as she stopped at a gas station. While she was filling 
up the tank, she spotted a tall, handsome young man with blonde hair. 
Catching his eyes, she smiled sweetly towards him. The young man&#146;s 
eyebrow raised as Michiru giggled flirtatiously. The man started 
walking towards her, his baggy blue jeans, black baggy t-shirt and 
denim jacket moving gently with the sudden wind. Michiru shivered as 
the man stopped before her and the wind slightly picked up.

&#147;Hello.&#148; Michiru said, looking up towards the man&#146;s face.

&#147;Hey. What&#146;s a nice girl like you doing in a run down place like 
this?&#148; the man asked, his voice deep and husky.

&#147;Just passing through. What about you?&#148; she replied. The young man 
smiled, taking off his jacket and wrapping it around Michiru&#146;s 
shoulders.

Friends say I&#146;m crazy &#145;cause
Easily I fall in love
You gotta do it different
This time

&#147;I&#146;m heading out towards the city. I hear there&#146;s some good races and 
stuff goin&#146; on down there.&#148; The man smiled, making Michiru blush. &#147;I 
gotta get moving if I want to make it there on time&#148; he kissed 
Michiru&#146;s hand, &#147;Till we meet again, my lovely sea maiden.&#148;

The man drove off as Michiru just stood there thinking, &#147;Who was that 
man? I never got to ask his name&#133;&#148;

Maybe we&#146;ll meet at a bar
She&#146;ll drive a funky car
Maybe we&#146;ll meet at a club
And fall so deeply in love
She&#146;ll tell me I&#146;m the one
And we&#146;ll have so much fun
I&#146;ll be the girl of her dreams maybe

Michiru sighed as she sat at the bar. It was a nice one, even 
though there were a lot of guys who tried to buy her a drink already. 
&#145;It&#146;s been a week since I saw him&#133;&#146; she thought to herself. She didn&#146;t 
notice a tall blonde sit next to her.

&#147;Hey, fancy meeting you here.&#148; The man she met at the gas station 
said in her ear. Michiru&#146;s eyes lit up, and she blushed. She could 
feel his eyes on her, looking over her attire. Michiru wore a white 
blouse and hip huggers, along with brown suede boots and the man&#146;s 
jacket.

&#147;Hey yourself. I was hoping to see you again tiger&#133;&#148; Michiru 
purred, turning to look at him. He had worn sunglasses the last she 
saw him, so she never knew what color eyes he had. She came 
face-to-face with the most deep green eyes she had ever seen, and they 
shined in the dim lights of the bar. The man smiled.

&#147;I see you like that jacket, ne?&#148; Michiru blushed slightly, looking 
over the mysterious man&#146;s attire. He wore black steel-toed boots, 
along with black baggy jeans and a black t-shirt with a leather vest. 
On the vest it said &#145;Devil&#146; near the pocket.

Alright maybe gonna find her today
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby come on
Alright baby come in
Pass my way
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby come on
I E YI- LOL

&#147;I actually like the person who gave it to me more&#133;&#148; she whispered, 
staring into the man&#146;s eyes.

&#147;I forgot to ask what your name was the last time we met&#133;&#148; he 
replied.

&#147;My name&#146;s Kaioh Michiru&#133;&#148;

&#147;Kaioh Michiru&#133; a beautiful name for a beautiful lady who plays her 
violin very well and creates lovely paintings&#133;&#148; whispered the man.

&#147;Yes, and who might you be, my mysterious man?&#148; she asked. He 
smiled, eyes glimmering mischievously.

&#147;I am Tenoh Haruka.&#148; Haruka chuckled as Michiru&#146;s eyes widened.

&#147;You mean the F1 racing champion, Tenoh Haruka?&#148;

&#147;That would be me.&#148; Haruka smiled a boyish grin.

&#147;You know&#133; rumor has it that you are actually a girl in disguise.&#148;

&#147;Well, how about we go somewhere that we can talk in private? I can 
tell that your artistic curiosity wants to know more about me. As I 
you.&#148; Michiru smiled, staring into Haruka&#146;s eyes.

&#147;Sure, let&#146;s go.&#148;

I spoil them when I&#146;m in love
Given them what they dream of
Sometimes it&#146;s not a good thing
But I&#146;m blind
I love hard with everything
Giving my all
More than they
I&#146;ll take my friends&#146; advice this time
I&#146;ll do it differently

Haruka and Michiru left the bar, and took off in Haruka&#146;s convertible. 
The cool night&#146;s wind blew through their hair wildly.

&#147;Where are we going Haruka?&#148; Michiru asked.

&#147;To my place, if that&#146;s alright with you&#148; she replied. Michiru sighed, 
leaning back into the seat.

&#147;No, that&#146;s fine with me.&#148;

&#147;Good, now fasten your seatbelt. It&#146;s gonna be a bumpy ride.&#148; Just as 
Michiru fastened it, Haruka revved the engine and sped off, almost as 
fast as the wind.

Maybe we&#146;ll meet at a bar
She&#146;ll drive a funky car
Maybe we&#146;ll meet at a club
And fall so deeply in love
She&#146;ll tell me I&#146;m the one
And we&#146;ll have so much fun
I&#146;ll be the girl of her dreams maybe

The next thing Michiru knew, Haruka stopped the car in front of a 
large apartment complex. Both stepped out of the car, Michiru gaping 
somewhat at the beauty of the building.

&#147;You like the outside? Wait till you see the apartment&#133;&#148; Haruka 
whispered seductively into Michiru&#146;s ear. Michiru shivered slightly. 
Taking Haruka&#146;s hand, she smiled in a sultry way.

&#147;Let&#146;s go then, Wind Racer,&#148; she whispered, slowly walking towards the 
complex with Haruka. They ascended the stairs in a comfortable 
silence, the sound of their feet hitting the floor almost 
simultaneously calming Michiru&#146;s raging heart. &#145;Why and I doing this?&#146; 
she asked herself, &#145;I barely know the guy and already I&#146;m heading to 
his apartment with him!&#146;

&#147;We&#146;re here.&#148; Haruka quietly said, smiling slightly as Michiru shook 
herself out of her thoughts.

Alright maybe gonna find her today
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby come on
Alright baby come in
Pass my way
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby come on

&#147;Already?&#148; Michiru giggled, &#147;I was pretty sure you&#146;d have the 
penthouse&#133;&#148;

&#147;Do you want to go up to my penthouse?&#148; Haruka asked.

I E YI

Michiru looked at Haruka, surprise written all over her face. Haruka 
chuckled. &#147;I own the penthouse, but I usually don&#146;t go up there a lot 
unless it&#146;s a special occasion.&#148;

&#147;Well, do you think this is a special occasion?&#148; Michiru asked, eyes 
gleaming mischievously. Haruka smiled.

&#147;I guess it is&#133;&#148;

My My
Looking for a gal gal
I don&#146;t want her too shy
But she&#146;s gotta have the qualities
That I like in a woman
Strong, smart, affectionate
She&#146;s gotta be all for me
And I&#146;ll be too
See you happily

After riding the elevator up to the penthouse, Michiru stared in awe 
at the view. The city sparkled with its nighttime magic, casting a 
pale glow of colors throughout the room. Turning around, she noticed 
Haruka staring at her and smiling.

Maybe we&#146;ll meet at a bar
She&#146;ll drive a funky car
Maybe we&#146;ll meet at a club
And fall so deeply in love
She&#146;ll tell me I&#146;m the one
And we&#146;ll have so much fun
I&#146;ll be the girl of her dreams maybe

&#147;I take it you like the view?&#148; Haruka asked, walking towards Michiru. 
Michiru nodded, staring into Haruka&#146;s deep green eyes. &#145;I&#146;m fairly 
sure Haruka Tenoh IS indeed a woman&#133;&#146; Michiru thought to herself. 
&#145;Haruka is very graceful, and her hands are strong yet gentle, and 
they&#146;re rough yet soft at the same time.&#146;

Haruka walked over to the balcony, opening the doors and standing 
outside. Michiru stared, mesmerized by the view before her. The lights 
of the city below made Haruka&#146;s hair glow like an angel&#146;s halo, and 
her eyes&#133;

&#133; her eyes looked like two glistening emeralds just recently polished 
and put on display.

Alright maybe gonna find her today
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby come on
Alright baby come in
Pass my way
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby come on

Taking a deep breath Haruka closed her eyes, the faintest whisper of a 
pout on her lips. &#147;You know&#133; Michiru&#133;&#148; she started, opening her eyes 
again, &#147;The rumors&#133;&#148;

&#147;&#133; are true aren&#146;t they?&#148; Michiru interrupted, &#147;That you are actually 
a woman?&#148;

Alright maybe gonna find her today
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby come on
Alright baby come in
Pass my way
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby come on

&#147;&#133;&#133;&#148; Haruka said nothing, and Michiru started to wonder what exactly 
was going on.

I E YI &#150; LOL
Maybe we&#146;ll meet at a bar
She&#146;ll drive a funky car
Maybe we&#146;ll meet at a club
And fall so deeply in love
She&#146;ll tell me I&#146;m the one
And we&#146;ll have so much fun
I&#146;ll be the girl of her dreams maybe
Alright maybe gonna find her today
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby come on
Alright baby come in
Pass my way
I gotta get someone to call my lover

Yeah baby come on
