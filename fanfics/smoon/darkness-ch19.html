<a href="../smoon/darkness-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>Author: Man I haven&#146;t updated in a long time. To tell you the truth I 
was getting bored with this story and I was paying more attention to 
my other ones. Thanks to all the people who read my story and making 
me feel confident into keep writing, because I was just going to give 
up on this story. Anyway on with the story.



Serena lay on her bed with her eyes closed. Rei sat beside her, with 
Serena lying against her, starring up at the ceiling. She was gently 
rubbing Serena&#146;s back, a small happy smile gracing her lips. She 
turned gently and faced Serena. She kissed her forehead and ran her 
fingers through her lover&#146;s silky tresses.

She smiled and hugged her lover closer to her, bringing her face 
closer to Serena&#146;s. She kissed Serena&#146;s nose and then closed her eyes, 
falling into a peaceful sleep.

Setsuna sat in the kitchen with Luna, Artemis, Amara, and Michelle. 
The woman stared blankly into her cup of blood. She felt something was 
odd, not right. Something was going to happen, and it was coming soon, 
real soon. She tapped her fingers rhythmically against the table top, 
brow furrowed in thought.

&#147;Hey Sets, what&#146;s wrong?,&#148; asked Artemis, worry evident in his eyes.  
Setsuna snapped out of her reverie and looked up startled. She looked 
at Artemis and smiled.

&#147;Oh, its nothing,&#148; replied the woman. Artemis looked at her a moment 
longer then smiled back.

&#147;If you say so,&#148; he replied.

********

Darien was gathering stakes and many other weapons for what was to 
come. He had a smile on his face, as the anticipation of finally 
capturing the one thing he wanted for years, was finally here. He 
pulled on a leather jacket and looked up when he heard a knock on the 
door.

&#147;Come in,&#148; he replied, putting another stake in a secret pocked in his 
jacket. Zack, Andrew, and three other men entered the room. One of 
them had short blonde hair like Andrew&#146;s and  piercing green eyes. The 
other had long black wavy brown hair and dark brown eyes. The last had 
long silver hair, with icy silver eyes.

&#147;Darien looked up and smiled, &#147;Zack, Andrew, Jed, Nate and Malcolm, 
you guys ready?,&#148; The five men nodded, small smiles gracing their lips 
as well.

&#147;Everything is ready and prepared,&#148; replied Nate.

&#147;Good, let&#146;s get going,&#148; replied Darien, escorting the five men out of 
his room. They went down a flight of stairs and saw tons upon tons of 
slayers.

&#147;When we go out tonight, I do not want anyone slain. We only came for 
the girl, that is it.,&#148; announced Darien. The slayers looked at him, 
as if he had grown to heads.

&#147;And if they put up a fight?,&#148; asked a man in the back of the room.

&#147;You fight back, but don&#146;t kill,&#148; said Darien, climbing onto his 
motorcycle. &#147;Is that understood?&#148;

Darien heard several replies of &#146;yes sir&#146;,&#148; Good, because if anyone 
goes against what I have said, they will be punished,&#148; replied Darien, 
before he put on his helmet. Some of the slayers looked at each other 
with horrified expression, as some visually gulped. With that, 
everyone headed off to get the one thing they wanted, Serena.

********

The Vampires sitting at the table looked up when they heard something, 
like a motor going, not one, but many. They all looked at each other 
in question.

&#147;What is that?,&#148; asked Diana.

&#147;I don&#146;t know,&#148; said Luna. Suddenly there was a loud explosion. All 
the vampires in the kitchen stood to their feet, getting into defense 
mode.

&#147;Something is going on!,&#148; exclaimed Amara.

*********

Jet and Rini shot up from their comfortable spots on the couch. Jet 
looked at Lita with red sleepy eyes, as Rini whipped her head from 
side to side startled. Mina and Tray ran in a few seconds later with 
Molly and Amy following behind.

&#147;What was that?,&#148; exclaimed Tray, with wide eyes.

&#147;I don&#146;t know,&#148; said Hotaru.

Suddenly the front door was thrown open, tons of slayers ran in 
surrounding  the place. The teens in the den looked at each other, 
before they were swarmed by the slayers. The teens heard a startled 
yelp from Luna and Michelle, when the slayers indeed broke in there as 
well. Darien walked into the den with a smug look on his face. Jet, 
Tray, and Hotaru&#146;s eyes widened.

&#147;It&#146;s you!,&#148; exclaimed Jet! Darien looked at the boy, confused a 
moment. Then he smiled, remembered exactly who this boy was.

&#147;Ah, I remember you,&#148; he replied. Jet sneered at him, anger burning in 
his yes. He lunged at Darien, fist raised high. He didn&#146;t get far, 
because he was grabbed from behind by a slayer, a stake pressed 
against his heart.

&#147;Try that again, and you will be a pile of dust,&#148; sneered Jed. Jet 
stopped struggling and glared at Darien with hatred. Darien waved it 
off.

&#147;Now to find that girl with the silver hair,&#148; replied Darien. Tray&#146;s 
and Jet&#146;s eyes widened.

&#147;You stay away from my sister!,&#148; yelled Tray, but the remark fell to 
death ears, as Darien disappeared down the hall.

*********

Darien walked down the dim lighted hallway of the vampires&#146; home. He 
walked over to doors, opening them, then growling when he saw no one.  
He finally came to the last do of the hall, he opened it. He was 
startled to see two females lying together, so peaceful and 
comfortable.

He walked closer to the bed and smiled when he saw Serena lying 
against Rei. He took another step closer, causing a creek to abrupt 
from it. He winced, berating himself. Rei opened her eyes upon hearing 
the sound.  She looked to Serena and smiled, not noticing someone was 
in the room with them.

Rei, suddenly looked up and gasped, seeing Darien their. Darien&#146;s eyes 
widened and reached for his stake. He took one out of his pocket and 
held it firmly in his hands. Serena opened her eyes, feeling her 
girlfriend tense up. She looked at Rei and saw her lover with wide 
eyes. She turned her head to see what she was looking at. Her eyes 
widened in disbelief and then turn to that of anger.

&#147;YOU!,&#148; she yelled. She sat up from the bed. &#147;It&#146;s you, the bastard 
who slaughtered my family,&#148; growled Serena, body trembling with rage. 
She jumped off the bed and lunged at Darien, just like Jet had done 
moments before.

Darien moved, dodging Serena&#146;s fast hands. He grabbed her from behind 
and threw her to the floor. He was suddenly thrown to the floor, as 
Rei tackled him down. Rei had her hands wrapped around Darien&#146;s neck. 
His eyes widened and he started gagging from the lack of oxygen.

Serena looked up and saw Malcolm in the doorway, with a gun pointed at 
Rei. Her eyes widened and shouted, &#147;Rei move!&#148; Rei looked up when 
something shot her in the neck. She dropped to the floor in shock and 
felt her neck. It was a tranquilizer dart. She felt her eyes beginning 
to feel heavy, before she knew it, darkness over took her.

Serena shot up from the floor and ran to her lover. She sat next to 
Rei and put her head on to her lap. She began to slap her checks, 
begging for her to wake up.

&#147; Rei, wake up please!,&#148; begged Serena, but the raven haired beauty 
didn&#146;t move. Tears started to form in the sliver haired goddess eyes, 
anger starting to over take her.  Darien looked at the girl with 
fearful eyes. Something was happening and he didn&#146;t want to find out 
what. He turned to Malcolm.

&#147;Shoot her with the dart NOW!,&#148; exclaimed Darien, as Serena&#146;s eyes 
were turning red. Malcolm turned to Serena with trembling hands. He 
finally shot the dart, hitting her in her arm. Serena&#146;s eyes held a 
look of confusion, before she sunk to the floor beside Rei.

&#147;What was happening?,&#148; asked Malcolm in shock. Darien shook his head.

&#147;I don&#146;t know and I don&#146;t plan on finding out either,&#148; replied Darien, 
walking over to the silver haired teen. He bent down and caressed  her 
cheek.

&#147;She&#146;s gorgeous isn&#146;t she?,&#148; said Darien. Malcolm walked over and 
kneeled down to get a better look.

&#147;Yeah she is,&#148; he looked over to Rei. &#147;What do you want me to do with 
her?,&#148; Darien turned his attention to Rei.

&#147;Go put her on the bed,&#148; said Darien, picking up Serena in his arms. 
Malcolm did as he was told, lifting Rei up and placing her in the bed. 
Then followed Darien out of the door.

******

Both men walked out of the room, with Darien holding his prize. He 
passed the den and then went to the kitchen. The elder vampire&#146;s eyes 
widened, seeing Serena in Darien&#146;s arms.

&#147;Where the hell are you taking her?,&#148; growled Amara, trying to fight 
off all the slayers. Darien looked at Amara with icy blue eyes.

&#147;That is of none of you concern, she&#146;s mine now,&#148; said Darien, walking 
out the door. The slayers shot the vampires with tranquilizers, before 
they too left, gone without a site.
