<h1>Finding Makoto</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mstenoh.html">MSTenoh14</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I don&#146;t think she knows, I hope no one else knows. Every time I see 
her my heart leaps out of my chest. I want to pull her out of the 
books she&#146;s reading and kiss her soft lips and run my fingers through 
that lovely blue hair. I bet it still smells like the water... not 
like ocean air you get seem to feel around Michiru ,but more like a 
waterfall. I know because once she spent a night in my flat and we 
kissed, not like real kisses though... *sigh* it was one of Usagi and 
Rei&#146;s suggestions, to practice on each other for when we had real 
boyfriends. I was shocked when she brought it up, being Ami she just 
blushed *The most adorable sight I&#146;ve ever seen* and said never mind. 
So I grabbed her by her shoulders pulled her close, and kissed her. 
From that moment on, I knew that she was the one. I felt thunder 
flowing through my veins. I saw stars... Now all I want is to lover 
her for real 

~~~

Makoto got up and gave her flat one last look around and shut the 
door. Now it was time to spring a surprise on her big sister. Makoto 
smiled thinking of the blondes reaction. 

***

Haruka was lying on the couch watching Mika Hakkinen win the Grand 
Prix of Monaco when the door bell rang. &#147;MMMiiiiccchhhhiiiiii, 
MMMiiiicccchhhhiiiii the door bell is ringing.&#148;

&#147;Haruka-honey your right next to it.&#148;

Haruka made a face and got up to open the door. Makoto sighed and 
looked at Haruka.

&#147;Not you, I was hoping to see that sexy mama Michiru.&#148; Makoto pushed 
past Haruka and took off her shoes, &#147;Oh yeah, Haruka my stuff is in 
the truck so, you better bring it in.&#148;, said a smiling Makoto.

She knew she was getting to Haruka, they had become close after their 
fight as senshi. Though either girl would never admit it, they loved 
each other like sisters.

&#147;Not on your life gorgeous.&#148;, Haruka said as she pinched Makotos&#146; 
right breast.

Michiru walked in, &#147;Hey! No boob pinching unless it&#146;s mine or I get a 
turn!&#148;

&#147;Hiya sexy&#148; ,said Makoto to Michiru.

&#147;So you finally decided to move in?&#148;

&#147;Sure did. Now I would if Haro-chan would bring in my stuff in.&#148;

Haruka shook her head no, but Michirus&#146; eyes told her carrying 
suitcases was in her immediate future. 

***

A little while later Makoto was settled in and having fun with her two 
best friends. 

&#147;No, MAKOroni, Hakkinen is better than Andretti.&#148;, said Haruka.

&#147;Ha.ha.ha, that really gets funnier every time I hear it Ha-PUKE-a.&#148;

Haruka jumped up, &#147;I&#146;ll show you puke!&#148;

Makoto ran into the bed room ,but didn&#146;t get away. She was immediately 
tackled by Haruka on the bed. &#147;So, you thought you could beat the 
wind, Thunder Girl.&#148;, laughed Haruka as she straddled and pinned her 
by her wrists. 

Makoto smiled,&#148; Of course not baka, it was part of my plan to get you 
all alone.&#148; 

Makoto lifted her head up and captured Harukas&#146; mouth. Michiru stepped 
out of the closet with a camera, &#147;GOTCHA!&#148;

Haruka jumped away, &#147;YUCK! EEEEWWWW! I need to wash my mouth out! 
Makoto germs... YOU&#146;LL PAY!!!!&#148;

The other girls were too busy laughing to care. 

***

Haruka was lying in her bed ready for sleep when she heard a knock on 
the door.

&#147;Come in.&#148;

Makoto walked through the door and lied down next to Haruka.

Haruka looked over,&#148; I said come in, not get comfortable.&#148;

&#147;Shut up baka. I want to talk to you seriously...&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148;, Haruka replied.

Makoto looked up at the ceiling, &#147;How did you know that what you felt 
for Michi-chan wasn&#146;t friendship.&#148; Haruka thought for a moment. &#147;I 
can&#146;t explain it, I just did. She saved me from that Youma and I just 
felt like it was my destiny.&#148;

Haruka looked over again and saw tears streaming down Makotos&#146; face. 
She immediately pulled Makoto into a bear hug. 

&#147;What&#146;s wrong little sis?&#148; ,said Haruka with concern coloring her 
beautiful features.

Makoto tried to pull herself together,&#148; Haro-chan I&#146;m different. I 
spent all that time looking for guys and doing bridal training, but 
it&#146;s not me. I want to be like you! I hate dresses, and I am in love 
Ami...&#148;

Haruka just kissed her forehead, &#147;I know sis, but you can change; I&#146;ll 
help you... just sleep now.&#148;

Makoto listened Haruka&#146;s breathing and fell asleep when she felt 
Michiru lie next to her and say goodnight. 

***

Makoto closed her eyes and held her breath.

::snip::

It was gone.

&#147;Stop jumping baka!&#148;

&#147;Like I can trust YOU with scissors!&#148;, screamed Makoto putting 
emphasis on you.

&#147;Well, that&#146;s true I should mess you up smart mouth!&#148;, commented 
Haruka with a grin.

&#147;I think Michi is back with your new clothes too.&#148;

Makoto waited for Haruka to finish with her hair cut. &#147;There.&#148; Haruka 
stepped back and proudly admired her handy work. Makoto looked at what 
used to be her pony tail lying on the bathroom floor. She started to 
look at the mirror. 


&#147;No&#148;, shouted Haruka as she covered Mako-chans&#146; eyes,&#148; wait until it&#146;s 
complete.&#148;

Soon Makoto was in her new slacks and over blazer which reminded her 
of the Mugyen uniform only with out the patch.

&#147;Now, look.&#148;,said Michiru.

Makoto excitedly went to the full length mirror in the den.

Looking at her reflection she was shocked! &#147;This is me.&#148;, Makoto said 
to no one in particular. Haruka came up behind her and slapped her 
hand down on Makotos&#146; shoulder.

&#147;Yes, it&#146;s you! You have been branded with the Tenoh seal of 
androdgany.&#148; she said laughing, &#147;Easily interchangeable from a man to 
woman.&#148;

Michiru giggled,&#148;You look very sexy, maybe you&#146;ll give Haruka a run 
for her money with all those school girls.&#148;

&#147;Hey, not you too! Stop jumping me!&#148;,pouted Haruka.

&#147;Your so cute when you look like that.&#148; Michiru said only to make her 
lover felt better.

&#147;Hey Mako-chan,I have an idea. Let&#146;s go out for lunch just me and you, 
it&#39;ll be my treat.&#148;

&#147;Sure&#148;,she replied.

&#147;I guess I&#146;ll go work on my song.&#148; Michiru commented as she left the 
room. 

***

The yellow convertable pulled to a stop in front of the arcade and 
Haruka smiled. &#147;Come on Mako, you have your first first public 
apperance.&#148;

Makoto just looked at the building, &#147;I-I can&#146;t.&#148;

&#147;No way are we going home Mako! Get out!&#148;, Haruka said enjoying the 
torture of her little sister.

Haruka got out and pratically pulled Makoto into the arcade. As they 
walked throught the door they spotted a group of school girls.

&#147;Now, Mako go work your charm.&#148;, said Haruka as she shoved the shy 
&#145;boy&#146; over to the girls.

Makoto was so busy being afraid she didn&#146;t notice all the girls 
drooling over her. As she turned around to walk back but a girl 
stopped her. 

&#147;Hi, are you new around here?&#148;

Makoto blushed, &#147;Yeah, I am.&#148; 

&#147;Pleasure to meet you. I am Ayame Syoran.&#148; 

&#147;Pleased to meet you Ayame. I am Mako Kino.&#148; 

Makoto kissed the girls hand and she blushed. Mako thought ~ Hey , 
this is easy, maybe Haro was right.~ The two talked for awhile while 
Haruka played racing games. Before the short haired duo left the 
arcade Ayame suprised Makoto by grabbing her and giving her a kiss. 
Ayame waved bye as they sped off to the Ice Cream Shop. 

***

Usagi was on her third cone munching away when she spotted Haruka 
pulling up with a stud of a man next to her.

&#147;Hey, Minako who is that?!&#148; 

~~~

&#147;Ow Haruka these bandages hurt!&#148; 

&#147;Stop crying! If your tits weren&#146;t so big you wouldn&#146;t have this 
problem!&#148; 

Makoto made a face at Haruka. 

&#147;Hey look who&#146;s checking us out&#148; said Haruka; ready to go in the shop. 

~~~

Makoto walked through the door and saw most of her friends gawking 
over her ,but Ami&#146;s face was still in a book. ~ Dammit I still can&#146;t 
get her attention .~ Haruka leaned over to Mako and whispered ,&#148;We 
have to go over there no da. It will be fine just use your natural 
charm...you love her just let it guide you.&#148; They walked over to where 
the other girls were sitting. Usagi and Rei were busy trying to push 
each other out of the way so the new boy could sit next to them and 
Minako was gawking with big heart shapes in her eyes. Ami finally 
looked up to she what all the fuss was over and their eyes locked. Ami 
was drowning in the pool of green eyes, they somehow seemed so 
familiar... 

***

It took forever for Makoto to get Ami alone ,but thanks to some quick 
thinking by Haruka, the others were now at a movie and Makoto was 
walking Ami to the library. The two stopped at the bridge and looked 
at the sun setting over the water. 

&#147;Look Mizuno-san I really like you... and I-&#148; 

Makoto was cut off by Ami covering her mouth in a deep kiss. The 
smaller woman pressed her body against the taller womans. Makoto 
reacted by pulling her closer and griding their midsections hard 
against each other. Ami enjoyed the warmth of Mako&#146;s mouth and the 
sweet tounge gliding against her own like silk. Makoto didn&#146;t want to 
,but pulled away shocked at Ami&#146;s actions. 

With wide eyes Makoto excliamed,&#148;I have to tell you something... 
I-I-I&#146;m Makoto!&#148;, she pulled out her henshin to prove it. 

She was ready for the worst ,but the blue ice senshi just smiled. &#147;I 
knew all along Makoto.&#148; 

&#147;Nani?&#148; 

&#147;I knew from that moment our eyes locked...I have always been in love 
with you I was just afraid how everyone would reatct. I think seeing 
you like this helped.&#148; 

&#147;Oh, Ami I-&#148; was all Makoto could manage before she broke out into 
tears of joy. Looking at Makoto, Ami too started to cry. 

She and Ami just held each other tight. 

***EPILOGUE***

Haruka and Ami stalked the house ready to get the jump on Michiru and 
Makoto... 

&#147;Remember blue girl just how we planned.&#148; 

&#147;I got you Haro.&#148; 

The team lined Mako and Michi in their sights and charged holding out 
two water guns filled with red paint. 

&#147;AAAaaaahhhhhhhhh!!&#148; screamed Haruka as Ami jumped behind the couch 
for cover. Haro was immediatly blasted with green paint! 

Michiru unloaded her gun on Haruka and Makoto was doing the same ,even 
sweet little Ami had turned on her. 

&#147;You little gggrrrrrrr.....&#148; ,bellowed Haruka. The blonde got a wicked 
smile as revenge came to mind. Being fast as the wind she scrambled up 
and caught her lover,and her friends in a paint filled bear hug. 
&#147;Eeewwww sticky!&#148;, shouted Michiru &#147;I hope you know you are getting 
this out of my hair!&#148; Ami almost slipped away. 

&#147;Nuh-uh where do you think your going?!&#148; Haruka placed kisses all over 
her face leaving green prints. &#147;Hey, watch it &#145;Ruka!&#148; Makoto said, 
&#147;That&#146;s my girl!&#148; The four friends had many good times, and even some 
bad times ,but through it all Makoto was glad she found herself.
