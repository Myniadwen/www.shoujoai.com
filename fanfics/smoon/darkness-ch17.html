<h1>Darkness (part 17 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/saiyagurl.html">Saiyagurl87</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/darkness-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>Amara pulled her truck up to what looked like a large rock. She rolled 
down the window and hit a certain part of the rock. The front part of 
the rock began to rise to show a secret entrance.

Amara smiled slightly and drove the car inside. The rock closed behind 
her loudly. Inside waiting for them was Artemis and Luna. Amara 
stopped the car and opened up her door.

&quot;Hey Artemis and Luna.&quot; Replied Amara as she shook Artemis&#39;s hand and 
hugged Luna.

&quot;Good to see you too.&quot; replied Luna as she bowed slightly. The rest of 
the gang got out of the car. Artemis tipped his head to the side as he 
saw Serena exit the car.

&quot;You got so big.&quot; exclaimed Artemis, looking Serena up and down. 
Serena whipped her head and around, her face beaming with joy. She ran 
towards Artemis and jumped into Artemis&#39;s welcoming arms.

&quot;Hi Artemis and Luna!&quot; replied Serena as she hugged Artemis. As 
Artemis set Serena to the ground, she went towards Luna and gave her a 
hug.

&quot;Nice to see you too Serena.&quot; said Luna as she tightened her hold on 
Serena. When they parted, Luna looked around the room.

&quot;Big group.&quot; remarked Luna.

&quot;Come on; let&#39;s get your things so we can come inside.&quot; said Artemis. 
Everyone advanced towards the car and unloaded their belongings and 
brought their things inside.

Once they set their belongings on the ground, five people entered the 
room. Serena recognized two of the five immediately and tackled them 
to the floor.

&quot;Jet...Tray, I&#39;ve missed you so much.&quot; exclaimed Serena as she gave 
her two brothers a hug.

&quot;Serena what are you doing here?&quot; asked Jet as he sat up slightly.

&quot;We had to leave because I killed two slayers.&quot; said Serena. Jet and 
Tray looked at each other with wide eyes.

&quot;You killed two slayers!&quot; yelled the boys in unison. Serena nodded her 
head.

&quot;Yes I did.&quot; said Serena.

&quot;No way.&quot; said Tray in surprise. The trio heard someone clear their 
throats. They turned around and found themselves face to face with a 
group of people. Serena and the twins got up quickly blushing all the 
while.

&quot;Okay, why don&#39;t we introduce each other before we get settled.&quot; 
replied Luna.

&quot;Serena, why don&#39;t you introduce everyone.&quot; said Artemis.

&quot;Okay.&quot; said Serena.

&quot;Alright, this is Molly, her brother Melvin, Amy, her sister Rini 
their mother Setsuna, Hotaru, her sister Rei and Amara and Michelle.&quot; 
said Serena as she pointed out every one.

&quot;Now Tray, introduce the rest.&quot; said Luna.

&quot;This is Luna and Artemis, their daughter Diana, This is Mina.&quot; Tray 
pointed to a young girl with blonde hair and blue eyes.

&quot;This is Lita.&quot; Tray pointed to a girl who had chocolate brown hair 
held up in a ponytail and green eyes.

&quot;This is my twin brother Jet and for those who don&#39;t know, Serena in 
mine and Jet&#39;s little sister. Everyone greeted each other politely.

&quot;Come on and let us show you to your rooms.&quot; said Luna. Everyone 
picked up some luggage and carried them towards to their respective 
rooms.

Jet, Tray and Melvin shared one room. Lita, Mina, and Molly shared a 
room. Diana and Amy shared another room. Hotaru and Rini shared a room 
and Serena and Rei shared another room.

The adults went downstairs to converse over a cup of blood as the 
group of kids stayed in the den. The kids were lounged around on the 
couches and the floor watching cartoons on the big screen.

Jet had his arm wrapped around Lita&#39;s shoulder while they sat on the 
couch. He took notice on how close Serena and Rei where sitting next 
to each other.

He lightly tapped his foot on Tray&#39;s back, who was ling on the floor 
next to Mina. Tray looked slight surprised and annoyed to whom ever 
disturbed him from watching his show.

&quot;What?&quot; questioned Tray as he looked up to his brother.

&quot;Have you noticed how close Serena and Rei are over there.&quot; replied 
Jet. Tray turned his head towards his little sister and saw Serena lay 
her head onto Rei&#39;s lap. Tray quirked an eyebrow and turned back to 
his brother.

&quot;Maybe they like each other.&quot; said Tray.

&quot;No way.&quot; exclaimed Jet at the impossible.

&quot;If you want to know, go ask her.&quot; said Tray.

&quot;Alright I will.&quot; said Jet as he got up from his seat. Lita looked 
away from the seat startled.

&quot;Where are you going?&quot; questioned Lita. Jet turned to Lita and smiled 
lightly.

&quot;I have to ask my sister something.&quot; replied Jet. Lita accepted the 
answer and turned back towards the television. Jet walked over to 
Serena wanting to seek out an answer.

&quot;Hey Serena, can I talk to you for a minute?&quot; asked Jet. Serena looked 
up to her brother and agitatedly sat up from her comfortable position. 
She followed her brother out into the hallway.

&quot;What can I do for you.&quot; asked Serena. Jet fiddled with his fingers 
for a moment.

&quot;Well, I&#39;ve noticed that you and Rei were getting kind of close back 
there.&quot; said Jet. Serena tilted her had to the side and smirked 
slightly.

&quot;So were you and Lita.&quot; said Serena. Jet blushed slightly.

&quot;Look, I just wanted to know if anything was going on between you 
two?&quot; questioned Jet.

&quot;Rei is my girlfriend.&quot; said Serena as she turned around and walked 
back into the room. Jet stood slightly flabbergasted.

***********

Serena walked back into the room and laid her back down on Rei&#39;s lap. 
Rei ran her fingers through Serena&#39;s hair.

&quot;So what did he ask?&quot; questioned Rei. Serena turned slightly towards 
her girlfriend.

&quot;He wanted to know if there was something going on between us.&quot; said 
Serena.

&quot;And?&quot; inquired Rei.

&quot;I told him that we were together.&quot; said Serena.

&quot;What did he say about it?&quot; asked Rei.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. He&#39;s still standing in he hallway.&quot; said Serena as she 
giggled along with Rei

**********

About 10 minutes later, Jet finally entered the room. He looked 
towards Serena and Rei who smiled at him.

He quickly walked towards his seat and sat down heavily. Lita leaned 
into him and wrapped her arms around his waist.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; questioned Lita.

&quot;It&#39;s nothing.&quot; replied Jet. Lita sighed and rested head on Jet&#39;s 
shoulder. Tray turned towards his brother.

&quot;So, what&#39;s up?&quot; questioned Tray.

&quot;They&#39;re going out.&quot; said Jet. Tray smiled.

&quot;I so knew it.&quot;</pre>
