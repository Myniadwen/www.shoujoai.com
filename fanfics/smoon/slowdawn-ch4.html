<h1>Slowly Dawning (part 4 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/slowdawn-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;Go where?&quot; Makoto asked, poking her head past the door to Rei&#146;s room.

&quot;A new Western-style bookstore has opened up in Juuban.&quot; exclaimed 
Ami. &quot;They&#146;re having a 1/2 price off sale on many titles and they even 
have a coffee bar in the store!&quot; Minako grinned at her friend&#146;s 
excitement - it wasn&#146;t this often Ami became that enthused about 
anything.

Usagi yawned hugely. &quot;A bookstore? Does it have manga?&quot;

&quot;Sure!&quot; Rei interrupted. &quot;I saw an ad that said it would have the 
largest selection of manga in town. And music too, and videos!&quot; Usagi 
perked up a bit a this and so did Minako.

&quot;Let&#146;s go and see what its like, then.&quot; Makoto spoke decisively and 
the others echoed her words with a collective &quot;Let&#146;s go!&quot;

Ami was not wrong. The store was huge - and stocked with an amazing 
array of books. Rei found herself wandering in the divination section 
- she had no idea there were that many books on astrology. She reached 
for a book on scrying and began to page through it. 

The flash of a blond head caught her eye. Usagi and...Makoto. Rei 
smiled to see the taller girl lean down and look at whatever Usagi 
pointed to. It must be something, Rei thought, as Makoto&#146;s face turned 
red and the two girls began to snigger. Rei turned her attention back 
to the scrying book.

A few moments passed when Rei, who had now picked up a book on candle 
magic, could hear Usagi&#146;s stage whisper calling Ami over. Once again, 
Rei watched, as Usagi, now covering her laughter with one hand, 
pointed out a book to Ami, who immediately blushed and turned away. 
How utterly childish, Rei thought.

&quot;Haruka-san! Michiru-san!&quot; Makoto&#146;s voice broke through Rei&#146;s reverie 
and she spied the two older women, looking as stylish as always. They 
greeted Ami, Usagi and Makoto cheerfully, then inquired what they were 
all laughing at.

Rei turned to her book again, but was startled by Haruka&#146;s loud, juicy 
laugh and Michiru&#146;s tinkling, teasing one. Now she was intrigued. But, 
Rei muttered to herself, I will not act so immaturely. Really - 
they&#146;ll have the whole store over in a second. But she watched as 
Usagi ran away then reappeared, dragging a reluctant Minako with her, 
to join the group of women, now heavily involved in reading the book 
titles and making giggling, sniggering comments. Minako took one look 
at the book titles and leaned forward laughing. She lifted her head 
and looked around. Spying Rei, Minako waved her over furiously.

Rei joined the group, noting the titters as she approached. Rei also 
noted that they all stood in the self-help section. What could 
possibly be so funny there? Usagi, looking like the cat that ate the 
canary pointed slowly to a group of books at hip height. Rei leaned 
over to read the titles out loud and began to blush furiously. &quot;Mars 
and Venus on a Date,&quot; &quot;Mars and Venus in Love,&quot; &quot;Mars and Venus in the 
Bedroom...&quot; 

She stopped abruptly as Haruka commented dryly, &quot;Well, at least they 
got the order right.&quot; 

Rei felt herself turn redder as she caught Minako&#146;s eyes. She turned 
to retreat to the divination section when Minako&#146;s voice sounded just 
behind her ear. &quot;You could do worse, you know.&quot; and Minako laughed as 
she turned away to drag Usagi over to the music section.

Rei found her eyes wandering now, no longer drawn by the book she 
held, but by the image of two blue eyes laughing and breath of an idea 
that would not sit still within her, or behave itself at all.
