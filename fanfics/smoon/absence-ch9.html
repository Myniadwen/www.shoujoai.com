<h1>Absence (part 9 of 60)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kirika.html">Kirika</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/absence-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Rodoth was sure he was finally nearing the end of the blood trail that 
had led him quite a distance away from the site of his ambush as a 
multi-storey building now stood before him. He would, no doubt, find the 
badly injured human female he sought... or her cooling corpse. The trail 
was hardly fresh at all now and broken in some places, but it had been 
enough for his acute sense of smell to easily trace. It had taken the 
youma a lot longer than he had thought, however. He didn&#39;t think a human 
could lose so much blood and still be alive, let alone still be able to 
keep moving for such a distance, but then, this female was no ordinary 
human.

Rodoth could hardly believe she had fought her way out of his trap. The 
youma he had chosen to &#145;greet&#146; her, were some of Khairephon&#39;s greatest 
assault warriors. Of course, he had meticulously prepared for even that 
scenario... no matter how impossible it had seemed at the time. Rodoth 
was commander of Makareus&#39; youma in this city for a reason. He had also 
ordered youma to watch a number of medical facilities in the event that 
the human escaped, with the hope that Khairephon&#146;s grunts would have at 
least wounded her severely during the springing of the trap.

Rodoth hadn&#39;t had many good tactical agents at his disposal to choose 
from for the stakeout job, however. Most of them were either already in 
the field, or still on the Pandemonium plane... so he had had to use 
youma with little practical experience in subterfuge. While it would 
have been better if the human had been ensnared, then killed swiftly and 
effortlessly at a hospital, Rodoth was confident that the female would 
soon die--if she hadn&#146;t already--if not by her wounds, then by him.

The only evidence of Rodoth&#39;s invisible, corporeal form was the dark 
shape of a shadow that could be seen conforming to the steps as he 
silently advanced up the staircase of the apartment building. He 
followed the increasingly noticeable stains of dark red blood, the 
droplets almost resembling liberally spilt burgundy coloured paint, then 
stopped at a door considerably marked with the dried fluid. His shadow 
slipped under the crack between the door and the carpeted floor and into 
the apartment. There was no one inside.

Rodoth allowed his body to manifest in the physical realm, suddenly 
appearing out of thin air as he returned to his solid form; a tall 
gangly being with fingernails like daggers. He looked around the single 
room, examining every detail... including the large oval bloodstain 
ingrained in the carpet fibres just in front of the door.

A white card also caught Rodoth&#146;s eye on a desk against the wall and he 
picked it up delicately between two stiletto fingernails for his 
perusal. It was a business card with the name &#145;Sanjuro Watanabe&#146; printed 
in the centre, followed by several other facts about the human that 
didn&#146;t interest the youma. He already knew who &#145;Sanjuro Watanabe&#146; was. 
The male was a reporter at the Yokohama Daily, and Santhesis already had 
that... situation... under control. Rodoth replaced the card on the 
desk, taking care to put it back in exactly the same position.

Rodoth slunk over to a wardrobe and pulled it open quietly. There was 
nothing of any real interest; only normal human clothes. He closed the 
wardrobe gently. The youma then picked up a framed photograph sitting on 
a small table next to the bed. He ran his fingernails down the picture, 
the sharp talons squeaking slightly along the glass, as he took note of 
the two humans in it. While it was a possibility that neither of the 
females in the photograph was the human he was looking for, both could 
be used against her. Rodoth had learned quickly that in this world, the 
beings cared too much for other members of their kind. It was a 
crippling weakness that the humans suffered in their hearts and a fact 
that was to his advantage. The youma returned the picture frame to its 
place on the bedside table and then looked around the small room one 
more time.

Rodoth was sure this area was the human&#39;s living quarters, but where was 
she? With such blood loss--especially with the amount gracing the floor 
of the room--she should be a carcass blocking the doorway. Perhaps the 
female was in another apartment of the building instead. Yes, that must 
be it. One of her kind must have helped her. Well, no matter. Along with 
the female he sought, that human too would die for their troubles.

As Rodoth resolved to check what was behind the other doors on this 
level of the building, he felt the first rays of sunlight strike him 
through the single window of the female&#39;s apartment. He had taken too 
long in his hunt; he had to return to headquarters before the sun grew 
too high in the sky. It was of no consequence, however. Rodoth knew 
where the human lived and could come at his leisure tonight to learn of 
her ultimate fate... or to orchestrate an unpleasant one of his own 
choosing for the female. But he would do it alone. He wouldn&#39;t trust the 
task to any of Khairephon&#39;s battle-loving youma, not after the poor 
showing they had displayed during the ambush. This assignment required a 
delicacy that only Rodoth himself possessed... he didn&#146;t need 
heavy-handed, hot-tempered youma botching things up again.

Rodoth re-entered his ethereal shadow state and left the apartment 
without a hint of noise, becoming a dark spectre evading the beams of 
sunlight. But that spectre would return very soon....

Rei tossed her head from left to right, trying to get rid of the 
tickling sensation on her face. Why was it that her sleep was always 
disturbed? And she had been having such a good dream too. Rei smiled 
luxuriously at its memory; it had been very... vivid. Flashes of blonde 
hair and silky smooth skin still skittered across her mind&#146;s eye even 
now. The miko then frowned, her eyes still closed, the remembrance of 
her enjoyable dream being dispelled from her thoughts. The tickling 
wouldn&#39;t go away. Rei began to raise her right hand to her face to bat 
whatever was causing the sensation away but then moaned in pain. Her 
eyes flicked open as she became aware that not only her arm, but also 
her whole body was wracked with a multiplicity of sore aches. It felt 
like a truck had hit her.

Rei&#39;s right shoulder throbbed... and her side... there was a sharp pain 
there whenever she moved even a fraction of an inch. There was also 
something cold and wet under her shoulder. The Fire Senshi turned her 
head to the right and saw that it was an icepack. Looking upwards, the 
tickling revealed itself to be displaced air caused by a lazily spinning 
ceiling fan above her.

Rei realised, now, that she lay in a single bed... but it wasn&#146;t the one 
in her apartment. Somewhat alarmed, she quickly took stock of her new 
surroundings, her lavender eyes darting all around the room. The place 
Rei was in was bigger than her own apartment, but it was still just one 
big room. In a corner to her left was a couch in front of a small 
television, and to her right, a desk with a computer and chair. A small 
kitchen was across from her, which looked well maintained. There was a 
dresser and wardrobe nearby the bed. The entire room looked very clean 
and tidy too... except for a pile of blood covered clothes on the floor 
next to the bed. Blood covered clothes. What happened the night before 
suddenly came rushing back to Rei.

Rei raised the bed covers and looked down at herself. She was in her 
underwear with an abundant amount of white bandages wrapped around her 
stomach and left thigh. The bandages around her stomach held a similarly 
coloured pad slightly stained with red to her wounded side. After seeing 
the extent of the damage her body had endured, the Fire Senshi let the 
covers drop and blinked up at the ceiling. Where was she? How did she 
get all bandaged up? Rei touched her forehead with her good arm and felt 
the rough texture of yet another bandage.

Rei tensed as the only door in the room to her left was opened. She 
relaxed when she saw Tsubasa walk in holding a paper bag in his arms. 
Now the miko remembered; Tsubasa had found her last night in her 
apartment. Rei had thought that had been a hallucination brought on by 
blood loss. She must be in his apartment. The brown haired man started, 
looking quite surprised to see her awake.

&quot;I didn&#39;t think you would wake up for hours yet,&quot; Tsubasa said, closing 
the apartment door, &quot;I was worried about leaving you alone, but I had to 
run down to the chemist to get more medical supplies.&quot; Tsubasa lifted 
the bag he carried for emphasis.

Rei merely looked at him as he walked over to her, her mind suddenly 
working overtime. How was she supposed to explain what happened? How was 
she going to explain how she ended up bleeding all over the floor of her 
apartment? Or why she hadn&#146;t wanted an ambulance?! Oh no, what if 
Tsubasa had called the police?! Rei gripped the bed sheets under the 
covers in two fists as she began to panic.

Tsubasa put the bag down on a bedside table, then pulled the desk chair 
next to the bed and sat on it. &quot;So, how are you feeling? You&#39;ve got your 
colour back,&quot; he said conversationally.

Rei blinked at him, her panic forgotten for a moment. &quot;My colour?&quot;

Tsubasa smiled a little. &quot;Yeah, you were pretty pale. I thought I was 
going to have to call an ambulance to give you blood, no matter what you 
wanted.&quot;

Rei wracked her brain for a plausible explanation for what had happened 
as her alarm renewed itself inside of her. &quot;Umm, about what h-happened 
and.... the &#145;no ambulance&#146; thing...&quot; Rei stuttered nervously, sinking a 
bit deeper in the bed, as if trying to hide beneath the blankets. &quot;I 
was... umm... attacked, mugged... heh. I guess I should have just let 
them have my money... I didn&#146;t have much anyway... but I put up a fight, 
you see... and well... I uh... have a phobia of hospitals so... no 
ambulance...&quot; Rei looked away from Tsubasa, hoping that the man would 
buy her lame account of the events leading up to their meeting last 
night.

Tsubasa sat and stared at the raven-haired girl for a second. &quot;Mugged, 
huh,&quot; he then mused, &quot;they certainly did a number on you....&quot;

He apparently believed Rei&#146;s story, to which the miko was thankful. She 
quietly let out the breath she had been holding and relaxed.

&quot;We should call the cops....&quot; Tsubasa went on.

Rei looked sharply back at him, tensing up once more. &quot;Ah, no, that&#39;s 
alright... you know the police never catch those guys,&quot; she said 
quickly, giving him a weak smile that she hoped appeared reassuring.

Tsubasa looked at Rei strangely. The miko started to think that he 
wasn&#146;t completely buying her tale after all. She swallowed 
apprehensively and tried to sit up. Rei winced as her stabbed side sent 
needles of pain straight to her brain.

Tsubasa put a light, restraining hand on her chest. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t try 
to get up,&quot; he advised gently. &quot;The stab in your side was pretty deep; 
you were lucky a kidney wasn&#146;t hit.&quot;

Rei continued to sit up anyway, disregarding her neighbour&#146;s suggestion. 
&quot;I&#39;ll be fine, it doesn&#39;t hurt as badly anymore,&quot; she lied. In truth, 
after a day or two, it probably wouldn&#146;t hurt at all. Rei silently 
thanked her quick Sailor Senshi healing.

Tsubasa looked at Rei with a dubious expression, but took his hand away 
as she moved. He picked up the icepack that had fallen off of her 
shoulder and replaced it carefully.

Rei gave him a small smile of gratitude and pulled up the bed covers, 
keeping her semi-nude body concealed. Not that Tsubasa hadn&#39;t already 
seen it, she supposed. &quot;I guess... you saved my life,&quot; she owned 
quietly, her eyes dropping to the bed sheets.

Tsubasa shrugged his shoulders and blushed slightly. &quot;I&#39;m just glad I 
remembered my first aid classes,&quot; he replied modestly.

Rei smiled and returned her gaze to the man. &quot;Thanks anyway.&quot;

Tsubasa blushed more and quickly asked if she was hungry. When his 
neighbour nodded, he went into the kitchen to make a late breakfast.

The Senshi of Fire looked at Tsubasa&#39;s clock on one wall. It was just 
after eleven in the morning. She had been asleep for some time. The girl 
then glanced around the apartment again, her brow creasing in 
irritation. How come Tsubasa got such a big apartment and she had to 
live in a damned shoebox? Rei shook her head slightly to rid herself of 
such thoughts. She was just avoiding the current, more important, issue 
at hand.

The youma had laid a trap for her and almost killed her in it, and if 
that wasn&#146;t enough, they had even had the foresight to wait for her at 
the hospital. Someone with brains was obviously leading them... most 
likely, Khairephon. The main problem she now had, was deciding what the 
Senshi of Fire&#39;s next move would be. She still needed to find out where 
the youma were all coming from, and since these creatures seemed savvier 
than her normal enemy, she had to be especially careful if she were to 
go back into the Hikodo gangland.

Rei was brought out of her contemplation by Tsubasa&#39;s voice. &quot;So... 
who&#39;s &#39;Usagi&#39;?&quot; he asked abruptly.

Rei was momentarily stunned. How did he know about Usagi?

Tsubasa walked over to the bewildered raven-haired girl with her 
breakfast on a tray. He placed it carefully on her lap, minding her 
gashed leg.

&quot;Uh... who?&quot; Rei said, stalling.

&quot;Usagi. It&#39;s a girl&#39;s name, right? You called it out a few times while 
you were... unconscious,&quot; Tsubasa said. &quot;Is she your sister or 
something?&quot;

&quot;My... sister?&quot; Rei repeated, still a little caught off guard. &quot;No, 
she&#39;s... she&#39;s my friend... my best friend...&quot; she finished softly, 
dropping her gaze down to her breakfast.

&quot;Oh. Maybe I can meet her sometime,&quot; Tsubasa said cheerfully.

&quot;Yeah... maybe...&quot; Rei said, subdued. She didn&#39;t like talking about this 
subject; she would much rather tuck into her breakfast. It was pretty 
good, but then, Tsubasa was an assistant chef.

Tsubasa sat in his chair and silently watched her eat.

After a few minutes of only hearing herself chew down her food, the 
man&#146;s constant scrutiny began to annoy Rei. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be at work or 
something?&quot; she remarked testily, flicking her eyes away from the 
breakfast to her neighbour.

&quot;I called in sick; I had to take care of you, after all,&quot; grinned 
Tsubasa. &quot;I called Anna Miller&#39;s too, so they know you won&#39;t be in 
today.&quot;

Rei nodded her thanks and continued eating.

Once his neighbour finished eating, Tsubasa pulled out a bottle of pills 
from the brown paper bag on the bedside table and proffered a couple to 
his &#39;patient&#39;. &quot;Here, take these. It&#39;ll help with the pain.&quot;

Rei did as he instructed, swallowing the pills down with what was left 
of her juice.

&quot;You should go back to sleep; your body needs the rest,&quot; Tsubasa then 
suggested.

Rei agreed. She would have to recover as quickly as possible; she 
couldn&#39;t afford to let the youma gain an advantage in her absence off of 
the streets at night. Sleeping through the day should speed her healing 
process. &quot;Right. Wake me up at about seven,&quot; Rei ordered, settling down 
into the bed, &quot;...and thanks again... for everything.&quot;

Tsubasa nodded, smiling. &quot;I should go finish cleaning the hall and 
stairs. You left quite a mess on your way home. I suppose we don&#39;t want 
people asking questions about why the place got such a haphazard coat of 
red paint sometime last night.&quot;

Rei made a sound in the affirmative, already half asleep. She hoped she 
could lapse back into that great dream again; it was a rare thing for 
her to dream about Usagi, her love. She was positive that the 
pleasurable images would help her wounds to heal faster, no.... she was 
absolutely certain of it... but if not, Rei could think of no better 
visions to accompany her slumber than those of her beautiful, angelic 
princess....

Rodoth travelled literally like a shadow through the night. The sun had 
long since set and it was time to learn if the fire wielder yet lived. 
If so, he would put her out of her misery. While it would be good if the 
girl were already dead, Rodoth secretly held on to the hope that she was 
still alive and helpless due to her prior injuries. He would enjoy 
taking her soft body apart in a deliciously slow manner.

Rodoth arrived at the apartment building and slipped inside. He climbed 
up the stairs quietly to the human female&#39;s residence, noting that all 
of the bloodstains were gone. The youma sniffed the air; he could still 
detect the slight metallic smell of the human&#146;s blood, making the near 
invisible creature&#146;s mouth water. Rodoth&#39;s shadow slid under the door of 
the human&#39;s apartment. He looked around, but quickly realised that she 
hadn&#39;t returned there. Rodoth began to wonder if the female had caught 
wind of him and abandoned her home.

The creature hadn&#39;t bothered to materialise on the physical plane of 
reality, so when he pulled open her wardrobe, the doors seemed to open 
by themselves. All of the human&#39;s clothes were still there; they hadn&#146;t 
been disturbed since the last time he had seen them. The youma glanced 
behind him at the bedside table; the picture was still present too. It 
appeared that his enemy was still in the vicinity. Rodoth slipped back 
out into the hallway, deciding to check the next apartment. If he had 
to, he would search the whole building until he found his target. 
Judging by the blood loss she had sustained, the female couldn&#39;t be too 
far away, though.

******

Rei awakened all of a sudden, her instincts on high alert. Sitting up 
sharply in the bed on her elbows and ignoring her aches, she quickly 
looked around the apartment to check if anything was out of the 
ordinary. Tsubasa was sitting on the couch watching TV. A tall lamp 
beside him provided the only illumination in the room and surrounded 
both couch and television in its corona of light.

Tsubasa looked over at the edgy miko, startled by her abrupt awakening. 
&quot;Megumi? What&#39;s the matter?&quot; he asked anxiously.

Rei paid him no heed and continued to scan around the room carefully 
with wary eyes. Something wasn&#39;t right. She sat fully upright in the bed 
wincing and letting the covers fall from her body as she did so. Out of 
the corner of her eye, Rei saw Tsubasa redden and avert his gaze. Rei 
continued to ignore him, reaching out into the surroundings with her 
keen senses. It was as if there was a... presence besides Tsubasa in the 
dark apartment. She couldn&#39;t describe it; she just had an uneasy feeling 
in the pit of her stomach.

Rei looked down at the floor in front of the bed and noticed that the 
shadow of a gnarled tree branch appeared just outside the edge of the 
lamplight. She then moved her gaze up to the door of the apartment, 
noting that it was still closed and appeared locked securely with a 
deadbolt. What was it that was disturbing her so much? Something 
wasn&#146;t-- wait, a tree branch? They were on the eighth floor of an 
apartment building!

Giving in to instinct, Rei swiftly rolled out of the bed just as the 
sheets erupted into an explosion of rags, something having suddenly torn 
them all to ribbons. The Fire Senshi landed heavily on her hands and 
knees, jarring her wounds painfully. She should have known; the presence 
she had sensed was a youma.

Tsubasa stood up, clearly wondering what in the hell was happening as 
Rei crawled quickly away from the bed while the remains of her covers 
floated gently to the floor about her.

&quot;Run Tsubasa! Get out of here NOW!&quot; Rei commanded in a yell from the 
floor.

Tsubasa looked at the scuttling raven-haired girl in shock. &quot;What?! And 
leave you here? Not a chance!&quot;

&quot;You idiot, RUN!&quot; Rei demanded even more forcefully.

However, Tsubasa stood his ground and shook his head stubbornly.

Rei scrambled to her feet and hurriedly moved next to Tsubasa before 
turning around to face the ravaged bed... but everything was now quiet. 
She couldn&#39;t detect any movement whatsoever, bar a few lingering shreds 
of fluttering cloth in the air landing on the bed.

Tsubasa positioned himself protectively in front of the underwear clad 
Senshi of Fire. &quot;Stay behind me Megumi,&quot; he said, pushing the girl 
behind him carefully with one hand.

Rei growled in annoyance and shoved Tsubasa back onto his couch and out 
of the way before quickly returning her watchful gaze to the gloomy 
apartment. The miko caught the flicker of a shadowy movement again near 
the outskirts of the circle of lamplight she and Tsubasa were in. As she 
watched, she could see the dark shapes of claw-like hands pierce the 
light pool, and then pull back as if testing it. For exactly what, the 
Fire Senshi didn&#146;t know.

The next time the shadows appeared, Rei let out a cry and lashed out 
with a high kick using her good leg. She aimed where she assumed the 
invisible creature was standing, but struck only air. Before Rei could 
contemplate what had happened, four bloody lines were sliced across her 
extended leg. The miko hastily retracted her limb and edged closer to 
the lamp.

&quot;Oh god, Megumi, stay back!&quot; wailed Tsubasa at the sight of Rei&#146;s 
spilling blood, the brown-haired man still sitting on the couch where 
his neighbour had unceremoniously deposited him.

Rei glanced briefly at the bleeding gashes running along the side of her 
right calf and dismissed them from her mind as mere flesh wounds. She 
then looked over to the main light switch by the apartment door enclosed 
in darkness; the youma didn&#39;t seem to like light very much. If she could 
make it to the switch and flood the room with light, it might be 
possible to see the youma... then she could destroy it.

&quot;Tsubasa... stay in the light,&quot; Rei instructed her neighbour in a 
serious tone of voice, while keeping her eyes focused on the border of 
lamplight, tracking the invisible youma&#146;s tentative probing.

Tsubasa directed a nervous look at Rei as he got up from the couch. 
&quot;What are you going to do...?&quot; he asked warily, approaching her.

Rei disregarded his inquiry and picked up the lamp stand instead. She 
began to cautiously move towards the light switch, using the lamp to 
keep herself in a constant circle of light. Tsubasa stuck close to the 
Fire Senshi, looking around the room fearfully as if every shadow might 
come alive and attack him. But who knows... perhaps they would. Rei 
wouldn&#146;t be surprised if the youma she faced had brought friends with 
similar capabilities to its own.

Rei had almost reached the light switch when she felt a sharp tug on the 
lamp cable. She looked behind her and saw the electrical cord floating 
in mid air while being pulled backwards. Tsubasa moaned despairingly at 
the sight. Rei yanked hard on the lamp she held, trying to break what 
was obviously the shadowy youma&#146;s grip. Suddenly the rubber insulation 
to the cable frayed, exposing the wire where it sported a series of deep 
slashes.

&quot;Damn it, it&#39;s going to cut the cord!&quot; Rei snarled through gritted 
teeth.

Rei quickly lunged straight at where she figured the youma should have 
been standing, causing the creature to drop the now ragged cord and 
blend into the darkness to become indistinguishable from the mundane 
shadows of the apartment. Rei came to a halt as soon as the lamp&#39;s cable 
became slack and Tsubasa, still beside her, did also.

&quot;Well, this is getting us nowhere,&quot; an annoyed Rei commented.

The Senshi of Fire briefly considered transforming and using her powers 
to light the room, but firstly, she didn&#39;t want Tsubasa to see her 
transform, and secondly, she didn&#39;t want to burn down his apartment... 
or the building either.

&quot;I&#39;ve got an idea,&quot; Tsubasa said, the eagerness in his voice easily 
detectable, though tempered by a healthy dose of anxiety.

Rei merely looked at him in disbelief.

&quot;I&#39;ve got an idea,&quot; he then repeated, sincerity replacing his prior 
anxiety after noticing the raven-haired girl&#146;s sceptical expression.

Rei turned her gaze out into the darkness of the room, keeping careful 
watch, and then indicated that Tsubasa should whisper his idea in her 
ear. After hearing his plan, Rei said, &quot;Okay... but I do your part.&quot;

Tsubasa opened his mouth to disagree, but saw the no-nonsense look the 
Fire Senshi was giving him and closed it reluctantly.

Rei handed Tsubasa the lamp, nodded gravely to him, and then made a mad 
dash for the light switch by the door.

Tsubasa swung the lamp in wild circles behind the running girl, almost 
smacking her in the back of the head as he kept pace. He didn&#39;t notice, 
however; he was too focused on spreading the appliance&#146;s illumination as 
far as he could to keep the light-fearing youma at bay. His neighbour 
was nearly at the switch when the room was suddenly plunged into 
darkness, save the dim light that emanated from the television screen. 
Tsubasa eyes dropped down to regard the end of the lamp&#146;s severed 
electrical cable and filled with dread.

&quot;Uh...&quot; he began, and then howled as his chest was sliced open, the 
wounds appearing out of the blue. He staggered backwards, clutching at 
the four lacerations and bumped against the wall, putting most of his 
weight against it.

Rei shut out her neighbour&#39;s pain-wracked cry and concentrated on making 
it to the light switch. If she didn&#146;t get more light into the apartment 
to disperse the shadows, the youma could take both Tsubasa *and* her 
apart at its leisure.

The Fire Senshi let out a surprised yelp as she felt something dry and 
rough grasp her ankle and wrench it backwards. Rei somehow retained her 
footing, and then tried to kick whatever it was off of her by shaking 
her leg frantically. She then screamed in agony as she felt four daggers 
puncture the back of her left leg. &quot;I&#39;ve already been stabbed!&quot; Rei 
shrieked furiously, the pain fuelling her temper.

The shadow youma roared an unearthly cry and let go of Rei as the 
television fell on top of the creature screen first, the glow seeming to 
give its body a corporeal form. Tsubasa lowered his leg and stumbled 
unsteadily back a few steps, having kicked the heavy object off of the 
table it had been sitting on in an attempt to deter his neighbour&#146;s 
assailant.

&quot;Go, Megumi!&quot; he cried, with a hand still pressed to his injured chest.

Rei flicked the main light switch on, activating the ceiling&#39;s light 
globes and filling the room totally with bright light. She turned around 
swiftly to face the youma and saw the TV roll off of the invisible thing 
as it clambered to its feet. The miko&#146;s eyes narrowed as she finally saw 
the complete shape of the creature&#39;s shadow on the floor, recalling 
where she had last seen such a gangly, wasted silhouette. It looked like 
the bald youma&#146;s shadow she had seen last night in the Hikodo gangland! 
The sly bastard must have tailed her back to the apartment building.

Rei watched the shadow move into a fighting stance, its stiletto 
fingernails extended sinisterly. Blood dropped from the air where one of 
the youma&#39;s claws would be and spattered onto the floor. Tsubasa&#146;s and 
her own blood. So, it wanted to fight. So be it. Rei was itching to 
finally face this thing without the cover of darkness for it to hide in 
or to protect it from physical blows. The youma must have some nerve to 
confront her alone after what she had done to several of its friends.

Rei smirked and balled her fists tightly. Now she could hit it. This 
battle would bring a whole new meaning to the term &#145;shadow boxing&#146;; it 
certainly would be an interesting way to fight. The Senshi of Fire 
entered a combat stance of her own, focusing hard on the youma&#39;s murky 
outline on the floor.

The youma screeched out an inhuman war cry and thrust with the sharp 
pointed fingernails of one hand at the raven-haired girl.

Rei nimbly ducked and delivered a punch to its stomach in retaliation, 
eliciting a grunt from her enemy. She then rolled to her left, cringing 
as she felt her old stab wound open a little and the warmth of fresh 
blood seep into the already stained dressings that covered it.

The youma whirled around, slashing at the air behind it as it did so 
with all of its natural daggers.

The Fire Senshi darted deftly backwards to avoid being eviscerated, then 
smoothly kicked her opponent right in the face, making the sinewy shadow 
on the apartment floor stumble backwards as its head snapped back with 
the blow. Ignoring the pain from her quadruple stab injuries and the 
blood that flowed down her left leg, Rei bounded forward to execute a 
crushing, flying kick to the youma&#39;s chest, leaving droplets of red 
fluid in the air behind her with the fast movement.

The shadow was launched backwards onto the kitchen counter, sending a 
shower of utensils careering in all directions. The youma then slid off 
of the countertop and fell to the linoleum-covered patch of floor on the 
opposite side, joining the stray utensils with a growl.

Rei took this opportunity to hurriedly hobble over to her soiled pile of 
clothes by the bed, and fished out an ofuda from one of her jacket 
pockets.

&quot;Rin, pyou, tou, sha, kai, jin, retsu, sai, zen. Akuryou taisan!&quot; she 
shouted as she saw the youma&#39;s shadow leap onto the kitchen counter and 
take a dive for her with the stilettoed fingers on both of its hands 
extended out in front of it. The miko threw the ward at the in-flight 
shadow youma&#39;s head, the adhering paper slapping against its face, 
seeming to float through the air. Rei stepped neatly aside as the youma 
crashed audibly to the floor behind her, paralysed by the ofuda&#146;s power.

Rei quickly struggled over to the kitchen counter and grabbed the 
biggest knife she could find, then staggered back to her fallen foe to 
exact some revenge for her similar treatment earlier from the creature. 
As she barked out a short shout of anger, she drove the knife&#39;s entire 
blade into where she thought the upper left side of the prone youma&#146;s 
back should be with both hands.

The youma growled hatefully as it writhed in torment on the floor--or as 
best as it could in its frozen state--its pinkish blood seeming to spill 
out of nowhere and pool into the empty air a few centimetres above the 
floor. Rei crouched beside her enemy and planted a knee on its back to 
limit its struggles while still holding on to the embedded knife. Good. 
The wound she had inflicted on the creature shouldn&#146;t be life 
threatening... well, at least not immediately life threatening. She 
ought to be able to get some information out of the monster before 
deciding to put an end to its suffering. Unlike her last youma captive, 
this one would die when *she* chose it to.

&quot;Now, you had better start talking! Where are you all coming from?!&quot; Rei 
demanded, &quot;Where?!&quot; she reiterated more forcefully. Rei felt the 
creature&#146;s body tremble violently, as if in an attempt to break free of 
the ofuda&#146;s divine hold, and cruelly twisted the kitchen knife in its 
back. &quot;I said... TALK!&quot; the miko screamed down at the seething youma.

The youma spluttered for a few seconds, trying to talk through the pain 
of the stab wound and the effects of the ward. &quot;Gates... gates to our 
plane, our dimension....&quot; it gasped.

&quot;Gates? Where are these gates?!&quot; Rei snarled.

The youma growled wrathfully again, its muscles tensing and relaxing 
beneath Rei&#146;s knee, to which she responded by viciously twisting the 
knife in its back a little more.

&quot;Grrr! There&#39;s one... in a place here... called Chinatown...&quot; the youma 
yielded.

&quot;Where in Chinatown?!&quot; the Fire Senshi persisted.

The gangly, still invisible, creature spat and drooled angrily, the 
clear fluid just appearing suddenly on the carpet. &quot;Wong Fei&#39;s... a 
store...&quot;

Rei smiled in triumph. She finally had something to go on now. Hopefully 
with this information to start from, she would eventually be led all the 
way to the location of the youma&#146;s leader, Khairephon. Then she could 
put an end to the threat to the people of Yokohama. The Senshi of Fire 
was going to burn every single one of these creatures until the city was 
free of them. This youma had better not be lying... but it didn&#146;t strike 
the miko that it was.

All of a sudden, the youma threw itself to its feet as its shadow moved 
likewise, the ofuda dissolving into scraps in mid air. Rei lost her grip 
on the knife and tumbled off of the monster&#146;s back, but ended up on her 
feet. The youma sliced backwards at her with its stiletto talons, 
forcing the miko to dodge to one side. The youma then sprang away from 
her and threw itself, knife and all, through the apartment&#146;s lone 
window.

Rei hurriedly limped over to the window&#39;s ledge in time to see sparks 
fly down the side of the building, no doubt from the youma using its 
claws to slow its descent. &quot;SHIT!&quot; Rei swore loudly, as it became 
horribly apparent that her adversary had escaped her.

&quot;What?!&quot; shouted Tsubasa anxiously, running over to Rei from where he 
had been watching her combat skills in awe. &quot;Are you going to die or 
something?&quot; He looked at his neighbour&#39;s blood stained body worriedly, 
scrutinising every dripping wound.

&quot;No, that youma got away! It knows me! IT *KNOWS* ME!!&#148; Rei shrieked at 
Tsubasa frantically.

Tsubasa stepped away from the girl, a little afraid. &quot;So...?&quot; he asked 
tentatively.

&quot;&#39;So?&#39; &#39;So?&#39; It knows what I look like and where I live!&quot; Rei panicked. 
She had to get out of there *now*. Rei rushed over to the paper bag 
Tsubasa had brought earlier that day and upturned its contents onto the 
bedside table, searching for more bandages to staunch her injuries 
temporarily until she had enough time to do a proper job.

&quot;You mean you&#146;re leaving?&quot; Tsubasa queried incredulously while watching 
his neighbour&#146;s frenzied rummaging.

&quot;Yes, you moron! That thing is going to come back here and bring a horde 
of creatures with it!&quot; Rei yelled as she began wrapping a bandage 
tightly around her stabbed leg. She was certain that the youma, if it 
had any smarts at all, would be back as soon as it could with allies. 
Unfortunately, or fortunately depending upon how one looked at it, the 
Fire Senshi had gotten the impression that the creature had indeed 
possessed some intelligence.

Tsubasa seemed to digest her news for a moment. &quot;More of those things... 
here? Oh crap! There&#39;s no way in hell I&#146;m staying here, then! Where are 
we going to go, Megumi?!&quot; Tsubasa wailed, beginning to reach Rei&#39;s level 
of panic.

Rei stopped tending her cuts and looked up at him. &quot;What do you mean, 
&#39;we&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Do you think I&#39;m going to stay here if weird, invisible monsters are 
going to show up?! Look at me, I&#39;ve already been hurt!&quot; Tsubasa pointed 
to the collection of slashes on his chest meaningfully.

&quot;Those are just flesh wounds, you wimp,&quot; Rei said, looking at his nicks. 
They wouldn&#146;t even scar; she was sure of it. &quot;Just pack up your things 
and go stay in a hotel or something.&quot;

&quot;Hell no! I&#39;m staying with you! If one of those things were to find me, 
I&#39;d just get scared and die! I don&#39;t know any martial arts!&quot; Tsubasa 
argued.

Rei cursed under her breath. She didn&#39;t want to take care of Tsubasa; 
she had enough trouble just taking care of herself. But it was true that 
the youma now knew that Tsubasa was connected to her in some way and 
would most likely use that knowledge to its advantage somehow. Rei swore 
again and looked at Tsubasa. The man appeared ready to bolt in any 
direction she told him to. She sighed. Well, he did save her life... it 
looked like it was time to return the favour now.

&quot;Fine, you&#39;re with me. Pack your things,&quot; the Fire Senshi ordered 
curtly.

Tsubasa eagerly bobbed his head repeatedly, and then ran over to the 
wardrobe to pull out his clothes. &quot;Where are we going to go? A hotel? I 
don&#39;t have that much money, you know,&quot; Tsubasa said as he quickly packed 
a bag.

&quot;I don&#39;t have much, either,&quot; Rei replied angrily as her temper flared. 
&quot;You&#39;re supposed to be the hot shot chef!&quot;

&quot;*Assistant* chef,&quot; corrected Tsubasa, irritating the girl just a little 
more.

Where were they going to find a place to stay at such short notice? It 
was hard enough to find an apartment in Yokohama, and that went for 
hotel and motel rooms too. Not that Rei, nor apparently Tsubasa, had any 
money for anything but the cheapest of accommodations.

Rei finished her speedy ministrations to her throbbing wounds and ground 
her teeth, not because of her cuts... no matter how much they stung... 
but rather in annoyance at the situation.

&quot;Don&#39;t just stand there, what are we going to do?!&quot; Tsubasa yelled in 
earnest.

Rei blinked as a thought came to her. There was somebody in whom she 
could call... though she really, really hadn&#39;t wanted it to come to 
that. But what other choice did she have? She was bleeding everywhere, 
which was becoming a rather unpleasant--and not to mention 
painful--habit, and soon youma were going to be assaulting the 
apartment, possibly killing innocent tenants in the process. And if that 
wasn&#146;t enough, Tsubasa was annoying her. It didn&#39;t get any worse than 
this.

&quot;I know of someone I can call,&quot; Rei said reluctantly, limping over to 
the door of Tsubasa&#146;s apartment. Now, where had she put that business 
card...?
