<h1>The Flu</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/fade.html">Fade</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It seemed as though the snowstorm had been the last spite of winter 
before spring decided to take over with a vengence. As it was, 
temperature had risen up considerably, giving a good idea of what summer 
had in store for Tokyo. The cherry trees were in full blossom, the birds 
were chirping happilly and all that sort of things. However, things 
weren&#146;t going as well for one Mizuno Ami. Indeed, the ice senshi, of all 
people, was stuck in bed with a very bad cold and a high fever.

Now, being stuck in bed wasn&#146;t such a bad thing, provided she could at 
least read a good book, that is. Even a simple article would do. 
Something like, oh, at random, &#145;The Entropy of the Muon in a Magnetic 
Field&#146;, &#145;The Complete Encyclopedia On Human Anatomy&#146; or &#145;The belly dance 
in ten lessons (Illustrated, DVD included)&#146;. But nooooo!!! Even this 
simple pleasure was denied to her. She had the worst headache of her 
life. Under this circumstance, even the Archimedes&#146;s law was a galactic 
mistery for her. Watery, bloodshot eyes and overstuffed nose didn&#146;t help 
in the least.

Wallowing in her own private abyss of misery, she heard the familiar 
buzz of the door bell, then her mother talking to someone. Quick 
footsteps followed before the door of her bedroom literally exploded 
under the vigorous assault of one Nurse Minako Aino. Ami just had the 
time to cover from the rain of wooden shrappnels behind her bed after 
having stuck a military helmet on her head. A genius should always be 
ready for everything...

&#147;Do not fear, Ami-chan!&#148; Exclaimed the senshi of love. &#147;For Nurse Mina 
is back from her torrid love nest where the hottest, sexiest succubus in 
the whole world lives, just for you! Yes, you heard me right! Right now 
my heart is torn between the spell of lust she cast upon me and my 
honor-bound duty to you, my friend!&#148; Her eyes became glazed. &#147;Bound...?&#148; 
She shook her head. &#147;No! I have to resist! I shall stand by you in this 
difficult time!&#148;

Pure, unaldutered terror gripped Ami&#146;s heart. &#147;Nonononononononooooo! 
It&#146;s nothing, just a little flu! Don&#146;t mind me!&#148; Sadly, her raucous 
flu-induced voice wasn&#146;t really convincing.

Mina strode over her, casually snatched the helmet and tossed it away, 
she then lifted Ami by the waist band of her pajama before throwing her 
back in her bed. &#147;Nonsense, Ami-chan. Awful little youmas&#146;re assaulting 
your body. Our motto&#146;s always been &#145;one for all and none for us!&#146; and as 
the leader of the senshis, my responsability is double. I couldn&#146;t live 
with myself is something happened to you!&#148; By then, Minako had tears 
welling in her eyes.

Ami sweat dropped.

Then she sneezed.

&#147;But Mina-chan, my mother&#146;s there and last time I checked, she was still 
a doctor...&#148; She said miserably as Mina set to tuck her under the 
blankets. In fact, to Ami, it felt like the senshi of love was trying to 
bury her under the blankets.

&#147;Oh, about that, she said she had an important meeting she couldn&#146;t put 
off. Actually, she was the one calling me to ask if I could take care of 
you.&#148;

&#147;My mother called you?&#148; Ami asked faintly.

&#147;Actually, she called Rei. But does that make any difference now that 
she and I have united soul and body for everlasting love-filled lives?&#148;

Ami groaned and sneezed once again.

Minako frowned. &#147;You have a sore throat, it must hurt, you shouldn&#146;t try 
to speak.&#148; Her face suddenly brightened considerably. &#147;I know just what 
you need! A grog!&#148;

&#147;A what?!?&#148;

&#147;Y&#146;know! Hot wine, lemon, honey and some other stuff. My mother used to 
make me drink some each time I was sick when I was a kid!&#148; She jumped to 
her feet and ran to the kitchen.

The young genius was so firmly tucked in that she was helpless to 
prevent Minako from doing whatever she was doing. She heard noises of 
clattering dishes, cups meeting their fate, small alarmed cries. She was 
dozzing off when the blonde finally came back, two hours later or so. 
She had small cuts and burns everywhere, but she was proudly holding a 
full jug of a strange dark red liquid. She gently helped the sleepy 
genius in a sitting position.

Not fully awake, Ami smiled at the delightful smell while Minako helped 
her drinking it all. The taste was sweet and deliciously perfumed and it 
soothed her painful throat. &#147;That&#146;s nice, I didn&#146;t know Mina could...&#148;

Her eyes shot wide open. &#147;Mmmmrdjko?&#148; She tried to say before choking on 
the grog she was still drinking. She jerked away while Minako patted her 
back worriedly.

Once she recovered, Ami asked her. &#147;What was that stuff you made me 
drink?&#148; Her head was already spinning.

&#147;I told you, a grog...&#148;

Ami stared blankly at her, slowly remembering what it was made of, then 
she turned her head, her gaze falling on the medecine pills her mother 
had given her on the nightable, then back to Minako. &#147;Oh shit!&#148; Was her 
last coherent thought before her world became a colourful blur...

---------------------------------------

Ami stirred. Her head was pounding like a giant Japanese drum. She 
didn&#146;t really feel like waking up, but something prevented her from 
falling asleep again. Feeling a presence by her side, she slowly turned 
her head and was met by the sight of a young brown-haired goddess sitten 
in an uncomfortable chair by the bed. The goddess smiled warmly, reached 
out and stroked a few sweaty strands of hair away from Ami&#146;s face.

&#147;How are you feeling?&#148; She asked her softly.

&#147;Mako?&#148; Ami croaked out. &#147;What happened...?&#148;

Makoto looked a bit uneasy. &#147;Well... Remember the grog, Mina-chan made? 
After you drank it all, you became rather... huu, delirious... So much 
that Mina-chan panicked and called Rei-chan, who called me in turn...&#148;

The blue-haired girl absorbed the news. No wonder Minako was so hyper if 
she was regularly given this kind of treatment! Finally, she asked, 
quite worriedly. &#147;And what... did I say?&#148;

Makoto blushed brightly and looked at the ceiling. &#147;Err... you see... 
When Rei and I arrived, you were in the middle of a... &amp;lt;cough&gt; 
&amp;lt;cough&gt;&#148;

&#147;Makoto... Mako-chan, what did you say?&#148; The threat in her tone was more 
than clear.

Makoto sighed. If not her, Rei or Minako would certainly tell her...

&#147;Ahem... you were kindda doing a... strip- 
teaseonaMarilynMansonsongandyouweretearingyourpajamasapart...&#148;

Funny how fog could suddenly appear in Tokyo.

Makoto took some time to compose herself. The mere thought of the whole 
ordeal sent multiple chivers down her spine. &#147;... Hum... as soon as you 
saw me, you came and pushed me on the couch and err... lap-danced while 
telling me how much you loved me...&#148; Both girl&#146;s blushes were so bright 
that some people on the street thought they had ended up in the 
red-light district. &#147;You really have beautiful legs, by the way...&#148; 
Makoto finished rather lamely. &#145;Damn! Why the hell did I say that? I had 
a nice speach all ready...! Niiiice legs, though, among other things...&#146;

&#147;I was doing a strip-tease? And you were there?&#148; Ami&#146;s voice was 
incredulous.

&#147;Err, and Rei and Mina too...&#148; Makoto inwardly beat herself up, why did 
she keep saying stupid things? Ami was probably mortified as hell and 
there she was, remembering her of petty details...

&#147;Hum, right...&#148;

&#147;And did you enjoy it?&#148;

The last question threw Makoto for a loop. She stared at Ami like she 
had grown another head or something until she saw the little smile 
tugging at the young genius lips. She answered with a grin of her own 
while enthusiasticaly nodding her head. She got back up and leaned in 
close to Ami&#146;s face. &#147;A lot... Let me show you how much...&#148;

She slowly leaned closer, tilting her head slightly and closing her 
eyes. Ami felt a surge of elation when she realized Makoto, the woman 
she was madly in love with, was about to kiss her. She closed her own 
eyes in anticipation and... sneezed, head-butting the taller girl in the 
process.

&#147;OWWW!!!&#148; They both howled, clutching their respective forehead.

&#147;Oh Mako-chan! I&#146;m so sorry!&#148; She felt tears forming.

&#147;No worries, Ami, no worries... Things like that happen all the time...&#148; 
She was still rubbing her forehead, a bruise slowly appearing.

&#147;Really?&#148; Ami sounded quite dubious.

&#147;Really!&#148; Makoto confirmed with confidence. &#147;You can&#146;t imagine the 
number of times I&#146;ve head-butted my ex-boyfriends.&#148;

An eerie silence fell between them.

&#147;Hum, good... I guess... Maybe we should improve our technic though...&#148; 
Stated Ami rather matter-of-factly. She looked around, suddenly 
remembering something.

&#147;You said Rei came too, didn&#146;t you? Where is she? And Minako? Did they 
go back to the Hikawa shrine?&#148; It was maybe too late, but she wanted to 
make sure that nothing that had happened here would transpire. She still 
had a reputation to protect, after all.

Makoto slapped her forehead, wincing a bit after doing so. &#147;I completely 
forgot about them! Last time I saw them, Rei was scolding Minako for 
videotaping you and they took off to clean the kitchen.&#148;

Ami paled. &#147;Video... tape?&#148; She asked in a strangled voice. She 
struggled to get out of the bed. &#147;Must find them! Help me!&#148;

As she stumbled on her wobbly legs, Makoto quickly picked her up and 
they made their way to the kitchen. Ami opened the kitchen door and they 
entered... to get out and slam the door shut almost immediately after, 
breathing heavily. More people got lost in the wrong part of the city.

&#147;Was Mina-chan tied to the table? Covered with chocolate?&#148; Makoto asked 
rethorically after finding back her voice. Her hold on the young woman 
in her arms increased. The feel of the soft, warm skin pressed against 
her own, coupled to the vision of her two other friends in the kitchen 
caused her to have a severe nosebleed. That was the last straw.

&#147;I think they need more time for... the cleaning...&#148; Ami answered, 
stuffing Makoto&#146;s nostrils with tissue. &#147;What was Rei doing with the...&#148;

&#147;Fresh air, need fresh air!&#148;

Still carrying Ami, Makoto walked to the window, stepped on the balcony 
and sat herself on one of the lounge chairs, the young genius in her 
lap. She took a long, calming breath. Aaahhh, better...

Ami made herself a bit more comfortable. &#147;You seem to have got fairly 
used to me sitting in your lap...&#148;

Makoto chuckled. &#147;You were so incredible, Ami-chan, would you mind if I 
called you &#145;my little frog&#146;?&#148;

Ami sweatdropped, wondering where that came from and if Makoto wasn&#146;t a 
bit too fond of French cuisine... That or she had finally lost it. As 
far as she was concerned, the French kiss was more than enough when it 
came to foreign importations. She just hoped Makoto would never come up 
with &#145;my slimey little snail&#146; as a pet name.

Makoto gazzed longingly in the two ocean pools that she adored so much, 
she slipped a hand on the back of Ami&#146;s hand and leaned in. This time, 
no sudden sneezing interrupted this all important moment. The kiss was 
everything they had dreamed about. Sweet, gentle, warm, stirring. Soon 
enough, passion took over and it became fierce, hungry, demanding, 
breathtaking. Ami&#146;s brain was litterally floating in an ocean of 
endorphine and adrenaline. However, it managed to come up with a 
revolutionary equation before it drowned happily:

0??[K x L] exp[S x N] = B x mg&sup2;t

for K = kiss (mmrrraow!)
        L = lust S = stuffy
        N = nose
        B = blackout
        m = mass g = gravitational acceleration (m/s)
        t = time (sec)

In other words, that the dizziness she was feeling wasn&#146;t probably all 
induced by the new feelings raging inside of her, but that serious lack 
of oxygen was certainly a primary factor too.

Luckily, Makoto finally realised that her girlfriend&#146;s face was turning 
as blue as her hair and promptly released her. &#147;Oh! I&#146;m sorry! I 
completely forgot about your flu!&#148;

Makoto wrapped her arms tightly around the young genius as she was 
recovering her breath. The sky was free of clouds and the stars 
exceptionally bright.

&#147;Oh! Look! A falling star! Make a wish!&#148; Makoto whispered.

A deep, warm silence engulfed them again as they both made their wish. 
They both knew each other&#146;s wish. Ami snuggled deeper in her lover&#146;s 
embrace, sighing contentedly and occasionaly sniffling.

Makoto reluctantly broke the intimacy of the moment. &#147;Hum... Ami?&#148;

&#147;Yes?&#148; The genius answered in a contented yawn.

&#147;Does it still work when you realize the star was a plane?&#148;

Ami smiled knowingly. She was about to pull an Usagi for once. Actually, 
she could almost hear the princess saying it. &#147;As long as it comes from 
your heart, Mako-chan, as long as it comes from your heart...&#148;

--------------------------------------------

Ami&#146;s mom sighed wearily as the doors of the elevator opened with the 
traditional &#145;DING&#146;. The meeting had lasted longer than expected, and 
then, on her way back home, strange men kept whistling at her and 
checking her out. She didn&#146;t mind the attention, but these guys were WAY 
too weird.

Strange, this suburb had the reputation to be a quiet and upscale one, 
though.

She was so deep in her thoughts that she didn&#146;t noticed the thugs 
waiting in the hall until she almost bumped in them. &#147;Oh dear! I&#146;m 
sorry! I didn&#146;t see you...&#148; She looked at them more closely, they were 
all wearing black suits and black coats. &#147;I don&#146;t remember having ever 
met you, are you new neighbours?&#148;

The closest to her smirked, revealing a golden tooth. &#147;Yeah, something 
like that, pretty lady. Are you the owner?&#148; he asked, pointing at her 
flat door.

&#147;Hum, yes, can I help you...?&#148; She was beginning to have a bad feeling.

They surrounded her. &#147;Ahh, I see you&#146;re really new, don&#146;t know the rules 
yet, he? Well, in that case, our boss sent us to welcome you in the 
business and wish you good luck. He said that he&#146;d be glad to ensure 
your security too...&#148; The guy drawled before handing her a card. &#147;I&#146;ll 
be back by the end of the week, we take 10 %...&#148; He looked her over one 
last time before leaving with his friends.

A hand on her door handle, she watched them leave, utterly confused. 
&#147;What the...?&#148;

The end

A.N: Funny how sometimes a fic stays blocked at one point for weeks, and 
then, suddenly, you are able to finish it in just one feverish 
evening...</pre>
