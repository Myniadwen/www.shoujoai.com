<h1>Other Disguises (part 4 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/otherdis-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&#39;For something that I had planned just to distract
Hotaru from her romantic problems,&#39; Minako thought
with amusement as the blonde girl walked happily
towards the Outer&#39;s home, &#39;it certainly has become a
distraction to me.&#39;

The practices for the Cosplay contest were fun, with
the rest of the Senshi dressing up as the Evangelion
pilots but more and more she found herself focusing on
Hotaru, what the younger woman said, did, or even
looked like. Even giving herself firm reminders that
she was straight didn&#39;t help, not to mention that
Hotaru was jailbait.

&#39;I&#39;ve never had this kind of attraction towards
another girl before,&#39; Minako thought, then with a
blush had to admit that was a bit of a lie.

Back when she had been adventuring as Sailor V she had
been persued by the intense police woman Natsuna, and
there had been a spark of... something, between them.
If Minako hadn&#39;t been so focused on a boy she had been
chasing at the time, there was no telling where things
could have gone. Similarly there were times when she
almost thought she was attracted to Rei, but the
intense young Miko only had eyes for Usagi.

&#39;I guess I know I can feel things for girls,&#39; Minako
admitted as she reached the door, &#39;but why can&#39;t I get
Hotaru out of my mind?&#39; She knocked firmly, only a few
moments passing before Haruka Tenoh answered it. With
a faint blush she thought, &#39;And here&#39;s another woman I
was atracted to.&#39;

Haruka flashed a smile, the boyish young woman&#39;s sandy
blonde hair falling into her eyes. &quot;Hey Minako,&quot; she
waved her inside casually, &quot;you and Hotaru going to
practice again?&quot;

Slipping her shoes off at the door Minako felt a bit
of a blush appear on her cheeks and answered,
&quot;Something like that.&quot;

&quot;Have I said thank you lately?&quot; Haruka said as they
walked inside, &quot;Over the past two weeks Hotaru has
been getting steadily better.&quot;

&quot;The feeling&#39;s mutual,&quot; Minako answered honestly.

&quot;Welcome,&quot; Michiru waved, the green haired woman
sitting there in the living room along with Setsuna
and Hotaru.

Minako casually noted that with a nod but her eyes
were drawn to Hotaru, her face smiling asllmost
unwillingly. The black haired girl&#39;s own face lit up
with a smile, rising gracefully to her feet. &quot;Right on
time,&quot; Hotaru said, walkiung over to meet Minako.

&quot;We only have a day or so until the cosplay show,&quot;
Minako smiled, &quot;and personally I need all the practice
I can get.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;&#39;re a natural actress Minako,&quot; Hotaru answered,
chuckling softly.

Minako blushed slightly, &quot;Thank you.&quot; A bit hurredly
she added, &quot;Let&#39;s get started, all right?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Hotaru agreed, taking Minako&#39;s hand and
leading her from the room.

&quot;Well, well,&quot; Setsuna said with a mysterious smile on
her face.

Haruka looked over at Setsuna suspiciously, &quot;You know
something, don&#39;t you? Some kind of foreknowledge from
the future?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Setsuna shook her head, &quot;just looking at them
tells me all I need to know.&quot;

Haruka fought back a smile as she tried to look
serious. &quot;To bad,&quot; she sighed, &quot;I always thought that
Minako was cute, too.&quot;

Michiru walked by and casually smacked Haruka on the
back of the head, &quot;No speculating on making it with
other girls in my presence.&quot;

&quot;Owwe,&quot; Haruka winced, rubbing the back of her head.
She looked over at Setsuna curiously, &quot;And what has
you so bouncy?&quot;

Setsuna smiled contentedly, &quot;I&#39;m in love.&quot;

Both Michiru and Haruka looked over at the ordinarily
serene Senshi of time in surprise. &quot;May I ask who...?&quot;
Michiru recovered enough to ask.

&quot;Makoto,&quot; Setsuna drawled, &quot;is remarkably mature for
her age.&quot;

Minako and Hotaru exchanged surprised looks then
quietly slipped away from where they were hiding
around a corner. They hadn&#39;t really meant to overhear,
but the temptation had just been a little too great
for the young women to resist.

&quot;Setsuna and Makoto?&quot; Minako said as they went into
Hotaru&#39;s bedroom. The lamps scattered around provided
a soothing sort of light, offsetting the sombre
decorations. Hanging off a hood on the closet was the
white plugsuit, shining in the dim room.

Hotaru looked thoughtful, &quot;You know, I think Makoto
might suit her.&quot;

&quot;Guess I&#39;d better stop throwing Makoto and Ami
together in their scenes,&quot; Minako noted as she sat
down on the side of the bed, kicking her feet
nervously.

&quot;You really are a shameless matchmaker,&quot; Hotaru
surprised her by sitting down beside her, &quot;I noticed
you putting Rei and Usagi together, too.&quot; She looked
over at Minako curiously, &quot;But what about Mamoru?&quot;

Minako made a face, &quot;Mamoru is in the United States
studying, the same place that he has been for months.&quot;
She paused, &quot;And Usagi may not admit it, but she&#39;s
miserable alone.&quot;

&quot;As miserable as I was a few weeks ago?&quot; Hotaru asked,
smiling slightly.

&quot;Well, maybe not that bad,&quot; Minako said.

Hotaru chuckled softly, then she reached out to
tentatively rest her fingers up against Minako&#39;s and
asked, &quot;And what about you?&quot;

&quot;What about me?&quot; Minako blinked, feeling oddly warm
all of a sudden.

Hotaru gave her a gentle smile, &quot;I mean, are you happy
being alone?&quot;

Minako gave her a thoughtful look, studying the
younger girl carefully. &quot;I&#39;m not alone,&quot; she answered
finally, &quot;I have the other senshi, my family....&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not what I mean,&quot; Hotaru answred firmly, &quot;what
about love?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never been lucky in love,&quot; Minako answered then
confessed with a smile, &quot;but there is someone that I
like.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Hotaru asked, feeling a bit nervous.

&quot;I finally decided that my bad luck with dating has
been because I&#39;m dating boys,&quot; Minako admitted shyly,
&quot;it&#39;s a girl I like.&quot;

&quot;I live with Haruka and Michiru,&quot; Hotaru reminded her,
&quot;that&#39;s something I don&#39;t really have an issue with.&quot;

Minako chuckled nervously. &quot;She&#39;s intense, really
inteligent for her age,&quot; she said softly, &quot;and lately
my heart skips a beat whenever I&#39;m around her.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve... fallen for Ami?&quot; Hotaru asked.

Minako looked at her then broke into a fit of giggles,
surprising Hotaru. Smoothly Minako bent forward, heart
racing with fear and gently pressed her lips to
Hotaru&#39;s, a chaste little kiss that lasted... a few
seconds. Then Hotaru reached up to wrap her arms
around Minako, pulling her close, and the kiss
deepened with passion.

&quot;Does that tell you who I love?&quot; Minako finally asked
breathlessly.

&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Hotaru rested her head on Minako&#39;s shoulder,
&quot;me, too.&quot; She laughed suddenly, &quot;Remind me to tell
you about a certain dream I had.....&quot;

&quot;What sort of dream?&quot; Minako asked.

&quot;You&#39;ll see,&quot; Hotaru purred.

Afterward...

The group cosplay preformance didn&#39;t win first place,
but they did make quite a respectable showing. Minako
and Hotaru drew lusty cheers dressed in their
plugsuits, but of special note was the interaction
between Rei and Usagi. More than one audience member
commented on the romantic intensitry between the two
who were playing Ritsuko and Gendo, the electricity
they had. But that was a story for another time....</pre>
