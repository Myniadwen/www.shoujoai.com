(Hotaru)
Gasping breathlessly I pulled the wonderfully wet heat closer and 
immediately had to bite down hard as a fist was drilled ruthlessly in 
my own heat. Hot tears were running down my face, mingling with the 
salvia from above. If my mouth wasn&#39;t occupied I would have screamed 
as the blow - and it really couldn&#39;t be described as anything less - 
hit my pleasure spot again with such force I was sure it would go 
right through to my very soul. I was in a state of numb bliss, 
neither caring, nor daring to end the agony that came with the 
pleasure. Why would I? It felt so damn good.
	Snaking my tongue deep inside of her and nibbing on the 
sensitive flesh with my teeth I felt her spasm in tune with my own 
rhythm. Shaking uncontrollably she thrust her wet pussy deeper into 
my mouth, grinding her hips down mercilessly and pressing me harder 
into the hard mattress. In turn her own strikes became faster and I 
was sure I was drawing flesh with my teeth as her fist pulled out and 
came down with even greater force and speed than before. Again and 
again. My vision turned blurry and finally white as my body acted on 
its own. And in one, life-threatening climax the world literally 
exploded.
	A few minutes later I finally regained some sort of 
conscience and found the very vision of a blond angel looming over 
me. Her smile was dazzling and I felt my heart melting as she reached 
out to stroke my face. &quot;Aishiteru,&quot; she whispered with unconditional 
love shining in her eyes before she snuggled up half on top of me and 
I closed my eyes with a happy smile...

	My eyes fluttered open and I sat up straight... only to fall 
back against the cushion with a heartfelt groan when reality began to 
settle in again. The smell of arousal was in the air and I looked 
down with disgust at the jeans I was wearing. How many times had it 
been now that I had these dreams? Of course it had started the night 
after the party. I could not get it out of my system as it seemed. 
Shimatta, I had only sat down for five minutes. Looking at the clock 
I noticed it had been twenty now. Shit, why couldn&#39;t I just forget 
about that mistake? I wanted to, I really wanted to. It made me 
scream that I was reminded again and again of that night. Wasn&#39;t fate 
through with me by now? Or was I just a commercial joke that could be 
used all over again?
	The slut, I hated her for making me feel that way, for 
wanting her to come and tell me that it meant more to her than just 
mindless lust. I hated her for making me want to crawl to her and beg 
that she&#39;d come back. I could not figure it out and that was the 
truly disgusting thing. It couldn&#39;t be love. Love had died for me 
that night... or better that morning. Hadn&#39;t it?
	&quot;Hotaru-chan... I am sorry for last night. I lost control and 
wasn&#39;t thinking. Maybe it&#39;s too much to ask but I hope we still can 
be friends.&quot;
	Yeah sure. As if! Deciding that a cold shower was in order, I 
was on my way to the bathroom as a gentle rapping from the door 
stopped me. I frowned, annoyed at the interruption. Nobody came here 
anyway except Minako and if it was her... It better not be 
her. &quot;What?&quot; I shouted harshly. There was a silence on the other end 
for a few moments and I was already tempted to simply turn around and 
follow my earlier intention. &quot;Hotaru-chan...? It&#39;s me. Usagi.&quot; I 
paused at that and walked over to the door but didn&#39;t open it. I 
wasn&#39;t really in the mood and why the heck did Usagi came her, she 
rarely did, more like... never!
	&quot;What is it?&quot; I asked again, trying to mask my anger and 
frustration a bit. Again silence at the other end for a 
moment. &quot;Um... can I come in?&quot; I shook my head but realized she 
couldn&#39;t see it. Sighing I realized I would have to say something to 
make her go away. I didn&#39;t want to deal with anyone. No one at all. 
And most certainly not the pending between faked ignorance and 
depression Usagi of late. I couldn&#39;t stand that. &quot;Usagi, I&#39;m busy.&quot; 
Looking over at my work room, I added. &quot;I have work to do. Just tell 
me what you want or come back later.&quot; &#39;Just tell me what you want, 
don&#39;t come back later,&#39; I mentally chanted. &quot;Oh... I just wanted to 
ask, um... I was thinking we could, um... make a Christmas... 
party... andwantedtoaskifyouwantedtocome...&quot; Long since trained in 
Usagi babble I figured the last bit out quickly but wasn&#39;t really 
listening anymore as my irritation turned to silent anger. She knew. 
From her tone and the squeak at the word &quot;party&quot;, it was easy to tell.
	&quot;Not as long as Minako is coming,&quot; I answered flatly and 
hoped dearly that the conversation would end with that. Of course, I 
couldn&#39;t be that lucky. &quot;Demo... Hotaru-chan... I know you are mad 
but Minako is really sorry and...&quot;
	&quot;I SAID NO!&quot; I all but screamed, ripping the door open and 
throwing the words directly in her face. The blonde shrunk back in 
fright and I flinched a little for screaming at my Princess but I was 
beyond caring already. The dream and then Usagi had brought my 
patience beyond the boiling point. &quot;Why doesn&#39;t the Queen Slut come 
here herself?&quot; I snarled angrily, my eyes flashing as a portion of my 
pent-up emotions came bubbling to the surface.
	&quot;What is it with you two anyway? Did she tell you how good of 
a ride it was while fucking you! Was it good for you? Does she do 
even half the things that she did with me?&quot; Tears began to glister in 
the other girl&#39;s eyes at this statement and a small part in me 
rebelled and screamed at me for being so cruel to my own Princess. 
She just wanted to help. I stomped down on that part, hard. &quot;Are you 
here for her, Usagi? Tell me. Or is it just for yourself?&quot; I 
continued in a now chilling whisper. &quot;You are pathetic, both of you. 
You bath in your self-misery all day and let yourself be fucked by 
her. A fine Princess you are, Usagi. Get real, you cannot change what 
happened and if you continue this, life will be out of your grasp 
before you realize it.&quot;
	&quot;Hotaru, I...&quot; she tried but I cut her off immediately. &quot;And 
Minako is not much better. Who does she think she can fool with 
that &#39;I&#39;m trying to hold us together&#39; attitude? It is not as if she 
is helping. Well, if she thinks she can discard me so easily, I can 
as well! For all I care, you can both stay away from me with your 
sorry excuses for a life! I AM NOT COMING AND THAT IS FINAL!&quot;
	With that I slammed the door shut again and stalked of 
towards the bathroom. Inside the roaring flames were surely but 
steadily suffocated by a blanket of regret and guilt. I was being 
overly unfair, I knew. But most of it was true nonetheless. Usagi 
never managed to move on... or at least give the impression that she 
did like Minako did. Our Princess had become a truly pathetic example 
of self-pity and depression, hiding in the cocoon of self-loathing 
she had spun around her in an act of swallowing all the blame for the 
horrible day years ago by herself.
	It was obvious what her and Minako were doing. In my eyes 
they would probably never be able to let go and get their lives back 
together. At least I had managed somewhat but their false pretending 
of mutual comfort would only lead them deeper into the illusion they 
had made out of their lives.
	And still, still I wanted to go and run right to them, 
letting my own wounded heart bleed with theirs.
	&quot;To hell with it!&quot; I screamed, shutting the bathroom door 
loudly behind me. I was not weak, I would not succumb to emotions 
again. The only thing it brought you was even more pain.

(Usagi)
By the time I made it back home, I had calmed down a little. Hotaru&#39;s 
words had cut deep. More than I wanted to think about. Had I really 
been so bad? It had been a long time since anyone ever accused me of 
being pathetic. Not since Galaxia to be exact. Having it smashed into 
your face like that by the heartbroken woman had felt like a slap. I 
could really not blame her for it. Yes, she had been heartbroken, I 
had seen it in her eyes, there was no mistaking it. Minako had messed 
this one up bigger than she realized. Hotaru felt the same way as her 
or at least did. The attraction DID went both ways as I had always 
suspected. But could it be so easily repaired?
	Something stirred in me, a feeling I hadn&#39;t been made aware 
of for awhile. A character trait my friends always said they envied 
me for, what made me so important to them. What was it again? 
Responsibility? A little. Caring for my friends? That too. 
Selflessness. Most likely.
	Hotaru was right. I had to snap out of this. For years I had 
dwelled on and on, listlessly counting days, days with no meaning, 
days I could have spent happy with my friends, if I had been a better 
Senshi, a better leader, a better princess... I couldn&#39;t make that 
right again, I couldn&#39;t bring them back, not anymore. But I could do 
something for the friends that were still with me and who needed me 
now the most. Minako had done so much for us, maybe... No, it WAS 
time for me now to do something for her and for Hotaru as well.
	A soft smile, not quite genuine but neither was it forced 
like always played across my lips as I entered the house mumbling a 
soft &quot;tadaima&quot; and going straight for the stairs. I stopped though 
when I saw Okaasan standing in the kitchen door, her arms folded and 
an expression of grim determination on her face. From time to time my 
parents tended to catch onto the fact that I was already twenty-four 
and still not having a job nor going to college - not that I had ever 
planned to do so. Father had become quiet famous with his photographs 
and he had been promoted shortly before graduation. We certainly 
weren&#39;t rich or anything but money was never much off an issue... At 
least it wasn&#39;t really necessary for me to earn any own income. 
Hotaru was right again. I truly was pathetic.
	Well that had to be dealt with later... After Christmas or 
something. Sparing my mother a glance I hurried past her. &quot;Not now, 
Okaasan. Later I&#39;ll promise.&quot; And with that I was up the stairs, a 
sudden energy flowing through my body once again. I didn&#39;t really 
know what about the actions of the last hours had woken me up from my 
state of lethargy, maybe it was just everything together. But 
Hotaru&#39;s words as harsh as they were had hit a nerve. Now, I had 
something to concentrate on again and I intended to not rest before I 
had gotten this argument cleared up and my friends on the right path 
towards a relationship. Yep, that I would do. My own life could come 
later.
	Whistling a strangely familiar tune that I couldn&#39;t quite 
place, I searched through my wardrobe to find something more suitable 
to wear. After ten minutes I still turned up blank. Darn, I really 
had to go shopping. Thinking back, I couldn&#39;t recall a time when I 
really went on a greater shopping tour, ravishing malls until the 
feet hurt in the last six years. Minako and I had planned to do just 
that for Christmas but first I had to make sure that Hotaru would be 
coming. Preferably in a good mood.
	Finally deciding on a white shirt and a matching sweater, I 
sat down on my bed to think. How to get this situation resolved? Both 
parties in question obviously had feelings for the other, deeper 
feelings. With Minako I knew and Hotaru&#39;s outburst had shown me as 
much. The whole thing was a terrible misunderstanding based on false 
judgment, fear and years of loneliness. The best would most likely be 
to set the two up, so that they could resolve the issue. But how?
	A devilish smile formed on my lips and I picked up the phone. 
Minako said she would be away from work for a few days and I had her 
cell phone number anyway. After a few minutes a click was heard and a 
groggy voice answered. &quot;Yeah, what is it?&quot; I suppose she slept in. No 
wonder with all what has gone on. &quot;Hey, Mina-chan, it&#39;s me.&quot; A longer 
pause. &quot;Usagi?&quot; she asked hesitantly, with an incredulous undertone. 
Okay, I hadn&#39;t been very talkative lately - I had that already 
figured out - and couldn&#39;t remember than the last time was I had 
called her. &quot;Don&#39;t sound so surprised,&quot; I said lightly. Now how to do 
this? I hadn&#39;t told her I was going to see Hotaru today. Didn&#39;t want 
to get her hopes up. &quot;You&#39;ll never imagine who I ran into today.&quot;
	&quot;Hotaru,&quot; came the reply a little tiredly, followed by a 
barely concealed sigh. Alright, then I was predictable. So? &quot;Listen, 
Usagi, you don&#39;t have to...&quot; I interrupted her before she could make 
herself miserable again. &quot;She said she wanted to meet you after 
work.&quot; Silence. I didn&#39;t like to lie but what was a lie in a 
situation like this? I was just helping, right? Right.
	&quot;Tonight?&quot; Minako finally squeaked and I had to refrain from 
laughing. Really, I wanted to. She sounded almost like the little 
schoolgirl on one of her &quot;love missions&quot; again. &quot;Yep,&quot; I answered 
seriously, glad that she couldn&#39;t see my face because I knew that I 
couldn&#39;t have fooled her.
	&quot;Did she say why?&quot; Her voice was hopeful and I really wanted 
to tell her that Hotaru was sorry and wanted to apologize but that 
would only lead to another misunderstanding. &quot;No, not really,&quot; I 
answered. There was another pause, then Minako could be heard sighing 
again. &quot;Oh... Okay, I suppose.&quot; Frowning a little, I tried to use my 
best motherly, chiding voice - having your future child visiting you 
frequently helped immensely. Well, not so frequently anymore... I 
pushed the darker emotions back and concentrated on the conversation 
again. &quot;You are going, right? You have to be going. Don&#39;t worry about 
me, I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;
	&quot;Well, if you insist...&quot; Minako was still 
reluctant. &quot;Absolutely,&quot; I told her firmly. And with a final &quot;Good 
Luck&quot; disconnected. A part of me really didn&#39;t want to let Minako go. 
I knew where was nothing between us, could never be but... NO! I had 
made my decision I had to get back out of this vicious cycle. I 
didn&#39;t deserve her anyway and had always known that someday Minako 
would find someone else and then our little meetings might have to 
stop. It wasn&#39;t a relationship, just a comfort for mutual souls. I 
wouldn&#39;t need that anymore, I told myself. As long as they were happy 
I would be.
	Why did a little part of me didn&#39;t believe that then?

(Minako)
The night air was chilly, no wonder in about a week would be 
Christmas. Snow was yet to fall - it was rather late this year - but 
the temperatures were already past the zero point. No human soul was 
out on the dark streets of Azabu-Juuban and would I be in my right 
mind I wouldn&#39;t be out at this late an hour too. Past midnight 
already, I would have to pass work tomorrow again but that was worth 
it. I hoped it would be worth it.
	Usagi&#39;s assault-like phone call this morning - okay, it was 
already lunch time or something - took me totally by surprise. I 
hadn&#39;t planned on confronting Hotaru so soon. In my opinion she 
should have some time to cool off. However, there was something in 
Usagi&#39;s voice that baffled me. Had that been a degree of happiness 
that I had heard there? It could have been that I was still to groggy 
from just being woken up from my cell phone but I could swear she 
sounded a lot more like the old Usagi before the incident. The old 
Usagi would have done just that. Figuring out what was going on and 
immediately trying to straighten it out. And try as you might, if she 
wanted something to be done, you could hardly resist her. And if 
Hotaru really wanted to see me...
	I turned another corner and found myself in the alley leading 
to the back of the bar. I figured that Hotaru would come out here, I 
hoped at least. It was still a mystery to me what exactly she was 
doing here. I knew Hotaru usually wasn&#39;t drinking. So what the heck 
was she working as here? Maybe I should go in and find out that would 
surely be interesting but I didn&#39;t want to get her angry even more. 
By any luck I might get our friendship back in some order. I couldn&#39;t 
ask for more. I wouldn&#39;t dare to ask for more. What was there to ask 
for anyway?
	As I was still debating with myself, the object of my 
desire... Err, that came out wrong. I meant that Hotaru was already 
came out of the backdoor. Her black leather jacket and jeans were 
blending perfectly with the darkness and wouldn&#39;t it be for Senshi-
enhanced vision and the constant pull when we were near each other, I 
wouldn&#39;t have noticed or recognized her at all. She didn&#39;t seem to 
have noticed me - or just didn&#39;t show it.
	I was just about to step into the light of the dim street 
lamp when I heard someone else approaching. Pulling back again I hid 
further in the shadows and saw two suspicious figures were moving in 
on Hotaru&#39;s position. Their steps silent despite the heavy boots. 
Clad in thick dark brown trench coat and a similar jacket as Hotaru&#39;s 
I could just make out that one was male and the other female. My 
instincts screamed for me to move out and help Hotaru but seeing how 
relaxed she seemed to regard the two, I stayed there I was and 
watched.
	Straining my ears I picked up pieces from the 
conversation. &quot;... owe us that money,&quot; I heard a deep male voice. &quot;I 
don&#39;t know what you are talking about. The job has been done, I&#39;m not 
responsible for you screwing up,&quot; Hotaru responded. &quot;... Listen, you 
better pay and if you can&#39;t maybe how about some other... favors.&quot; I 
cringed at that, it was obviously what they were talking about and 
the subject hit too close to home for my liking.
	&quot;Gomen, I&#39;m not interested in bullies,&quot; Hotaru responded 
coolly and I had to smile. Before the man could voice his disapproval 
I saw the woman move forward, pressing herself not to subtly against 
Hotaru&#39;s body. &quot;Then you might go for something else?&quot; she asked 
seductively. That turned out to be a mistake. A big mistake. Before 
the woman could as much as blink Hotaru had already thrown her 
against the wall of the bar, holding her up with one hand around her 
throat. The man moved to help his partner but only received a 
backhand for his troubles that sent him flying into a pile of 
trashcans, successfully stunning him.
	&quot;I don&#39;t like to be touched,&quot; Hotaru stated in a deathly low 
and chilling voice. I had already moved from my hiding place, seeing 
as the woman - as much as she deserved it - was not really in any 
position to speak and would not be permanently, if I didn&#39;t do 
anything. At the useless attempts of the woman to claw at Hotaru&#39;s 
hands, my friend only squeezed tighter and if she continued that any 
further would surely snap her neck.
	&quot;Hotaru!&quot; I called out, using a commanding tone that was more 
familiar with my alter ego. Her head turned and she snarled when her 
eyes spotted me. I was taken aback momentarily by the expression. 
There was a flicker of hate and accusation, that much I had expected, 
but for the most part they were ice-cold, expressionless. Just like 
Sailorsaturn&#39;s... Maybe even like... &quot;Stop it,&quot; I croaked out, my 
voice barely above a whisper, a sudden fear washing over me.
	Hotaru&#39;s eyes didn&#39;t lose their distant look. Turning back to 
the helpless woman who seemed to be suffocating every second now, she 
replied. &quot;Why should I? Why should I listen to you?&quot; The monotone 
tone cut deep and I had to force myself mentally to control my racing 
heart. Had I done this? Had I brought her to snap and leave her alter 
ego free reign? &quot;It&#39;s not, as if anyone cares anyway in this world...&quot;
	Reaching out with her other hand she adjusted her grip on the 
woman&#39;s throat who was now choking heavily, blood was running out of 
her mouth. I couldn&#39;t let this continue. Hotaru wasn&#39;t a murderer and 
I would never forgive myself, if I made her one. Gathering my 
strength, I said as firmly as I managed: &quot;Do you want to become like 
her?&quot; I didn&#39;t need to say the name. Hotaru knew deep down exactly 
who I was referring to.
	The woman spat blood and gasped for air the same time that 
Hotaru dropped her to the ground as she suddenly froze up on the 
spot. I didn&#39;t want to cut deeper but I needed to get my point 
across. &quot;You don&#39;t want to become a murderer, Hotaru,&quot; I continued 
while approaching her slowly. &quot;You don&#39;t want to be like her, 
becoming what you despised the most. Remember, you told me 
yourself...&quot; The raven-haired girl began shaking uncontrollably with 
my words and as I reached out with a tentative hand for her shoulder 
she finally crumbled and sunk down to her knees, tears breaking 
through the dam she had built for herself over the years.
	I spared a glance at the woman. Her partner seemed to have 
recovered enough. I gave him one look and he hurriedly picked the 
female up and vanished into the night. Looking back down at the girl 
huddled in a heap of misery on the ground, I felt my heart debating 
with itself whether to break or reach out to her. Hunching down I 
gently pulled the softly crying girl I still considered as a friend, 
maybe even more so, into a tight embrace, deciding to never let go 
even when the world around us would end. With one hand I softly 
stroke through the long dark mane that fell long over her shoulders 
and I wished nothing more at this moment than to make everything 
better although I knew I probably could not.
	&quot;Gomen nasei...&quot; I murmured. Hotaru&#39;s tear flow finally 
stopped and she looked up through blurry pupils at me with a mixture 
of wonder and pain. &quot;I never wanted to hurt you,&quot; I told her 
truthfully, pouring my pent-up feelings into the world. &quot;But you 
did,&quot; Hotaru whispered and pushed me away a little, as she stood up. 
I flinched but refused to give ground now. This needed to be resolved 
here and now or else I would neither find the strength nor get the 
chance ever again. &quot;Onegai, Hotaru. What else do I have to do? I 
already said I was sorry for sleeping with you...&quot;
	&quot;THAT IS NOT WHY YOU HURT ME!&quot; I reeled back from the 
intensity of her shout and was mildly surprised that I didn&#39;t fell on 
my butt. But I was too shocked to even took notice of this. My eyes 
held hers. Gone was the coldness, replaced by hot-blazing anger and 
pain, pain that went like a knife right through my heart. &quot;Then... 
Then why?&quot; I managed to whisper, my mind racing. Hotaru looked 
away. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t understand.&quot; She tried to sound cold again but 
failed miserably.
	What was she implying? I thought that I ruined our friendship 
by giving into temptations, by letting my desire reign my judgment. I 
thought I violated her trust and that I would have completely 
understood. But if I hadn&#39;t hurt her by the act when why... A 
horrible suspicion began to gnaw on my conscience. I caught her wrist 
before she could move away and spun her around, fixing my eyes on 
hers. &quot;WHY?&quot; I repeated as strongly as she did before, with a truly 
desperate note to it. Hotaru hesitated for a moment, when in a quiet 
whisper answered: &quot;Because you left.&quot;
	And suddenly I felt all numb. Megami, what had I done? She 
hadn&#39;t been unwilling, even in my state she hadn&#39;t been and it hadn&#39;t 
been just for comfort either. It made all a a horrible kind of sense 
now. Hotaru had WANTED more, she had expected more, she had at least 
expected me to be there when she woke up. And like a chicken I left, 
left her like some unworthy whore after a good one night stand.
	&quot;Kami... How can I ever make this right again?&quot; I asked, 
speaking more to myself than Hotaru. Shame started to mingle with the 
rising feelings I had kept hidden so long, I had not allowed myself 
to feel ever since the fateful day that had shaped our lives ever 
since then. Yes, how could I ever repair what I had done? I didn&#39;t 
know and I honestly didn&#39;t know what to make of the overwhelming 
emotions threatening to tear me apart or how to deal with the new 
information.
	On instincts alone, my hands that had hovered right under 
Hotaru&#39;s chin anyway, reached out to lift her head ever so softly. 
Mechanism as old as mankind took over as my mind was unable to deal 
anymore with the chaos the situation had developed into. And as my 
lips finally met hers, I let go of all the feelings and emotions that 
were inside of me for years now. The kiss wasn&#39;t harsh or demanding 
or anything the matter. Barely a soft caress it came straight from 
the heart instead, genuine and full of... love.
