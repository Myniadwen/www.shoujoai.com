<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 4 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><p>After finding a way to calm Hotaru back to sleep, the group finally left behind the sweet 
fragrance of flowers and stepped back towards the unrelenting, sandy dunes. From the very 
first moment that they stepped onto the barren land, the rough, dry air forcefully invaded 
their lungs and blew sand up into their eyes. Minako shuddered terribly; although the armor 
indeed sheltered her from the brunt of the heat, she could have sworn that it had got hotter 
once again. The Venusian glanced over at her companion and guide. Despite her injury, the 
Martian commander appeared unaffected by the drastic change in environment. Instead, it 
appeared that she was devoting her efforts into protecting her new charge. She had removed 
both her arm guards and her helmet, and equipped them to the child.</p><p>Dragging her heels 
through the heavy sand, Minako quietly fought the increasing surge of envy she felt from 
Hotaru.</p><p><i>Look at her, sleeping so peacefully and in Rei’s arms too! Argh! 
</i></p><p><i>Oh, what are you doing, Minako?!</i> The blonde shook her head to the side and 
held a hand to her brow to steady herself. <i>What am I thinking? The heat must be getting 
to me because this is just nuts! I’m an adult! A Goddess to be precise! Why should someone 
like me be jealous of a little kid like her? Just because Rei likes her better than me... 
</i>Realizing what she had just thought she was quick to contradict, <i>Wait, nu-uh! It’s 
not like that at all! I’m only here for the mission. Yeah, that’s it. Once it’s all over, 
I’m outta here. I’ll go home, and then I’ll...</i></p><p><i>I’ll...Wait, when it’s done, 
what am I going to do?<br></i><br>She paused.</p><p>On the other hand, Rei wasn’t fairing as 
well as the show she put up. They had been marching steadily for close to an hour now. Sweat 
gleamed as it poured down the sides of her temples, steadily increasing with the growing 
thirst she felt from dehydration. Yet she worried for Hotaru more; Rei’s arms were trembling 
now. Without her arm guards her delicate skin was quickly becoming burnt, ravaged 
mercilessly by both the sun and the very air she breathed.</p><p><i>This isn’t good…</i> Rei 
winced when a few sand grains flew into her eye. <i>Ow! </i>She instinctively shook her head 
but was unable to draw the solid out. <i>Geh</i>. <i>If I could only use my arms…</i> She 
tried to pull a hand up close to her face, but it was no use. She just didn’t have the 
strength anymore. She wondered how much longer she could carry the girl at all.</p><p><i>I 
can’t ask that Minako person to carry this girl for me, that’s definitely out of the 
question. She’s just another diplomat. Until she came here, she didn’t have any battle 
experience at all. </i></p><p>Rei gave a heavy sigh. From what she knew, she figured the 
Venusian had as much arm strength as the girl she was short, she was useless. Why did she 
even consider asking for help in the first place?</p><p>“<i>Look, maybe you’re putting too 
much of yourself into this whole leader image. If someone offers you help, then take it! 
That wound isn’t going to go away by itself.”</i></p><p><i>That wound isn’t going to go away 
by itself.</i> Although the Martian couldn’t see it, she could still feel liquid dripping 
down her leg and making a squishy mess at the bottom of her boot.</p><p>Rei deeply 
scowled.</p><p><i>I don’t need help! I am the Martian Commander; I was chosen to lead the 
people in Ares’ place. There is no one else on this planet who is my equal. I’m strong. I 
was chosen because I’m not--</i></p><p>“THAT’S NOT IT AT ALL!” Minako abruptly bellowed, and 
Rei nearly fell over in surprise.</p><p>“W-What’s not it?” The Martian whirled around 
tensely. Her eyes flew wildly around their surroundings, anticipating the worst.</p><p>“I-I 
erm… ahahaha… it’s umm… nothing.” Minako replied flatly with a small wave. Her face was 
extremely flushed but whether it was from embarrassment or the heat, Rei couldn’t tell 
(although she had an inkling it was a mixture of both). “Forget about 
it.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Oh don’t give me that look! I’m fine, FINE, see?” The blonde plastered 
a smile on her face. “I’m smiling and therefore, I’m happy. Yup, nooooothing wrong with good 
o’l Minako. Hahaha….haha…”</p><p><i>I knew it. The heat has finally gotten to her.</i> 
<i>She’s completely delirious now.</i></p><p>Rei sweat dropped as she watched the woman 
proceeded to rant about the differences between a sweltering, hot ball of gas (the Sun) and 
her smile. <i>Maybe we should just start sprinting for the palace and see how it goes?</i> 
But that idea was quickly tossed out into the desert when Minako began to pull at the 
corners of her mouth in an impossible attempt to widen her smile further.</p><p>“Minako? 
What are you doing...?” Rei stared. <i>That actually looks pretty 
painful...</i></p><p>“Smiiiling ish good... I mean, ahem, there’s warmth from a smile and 
the Sun is really warm too, so since the sun is big, the bigger the smile, the more warmth 
there is, right?”</p><p>“Uhh... Sure. Minako? Could you come over here for second?” Rei 
tried again.</p><p>“I—Hm?” Her heart nearly leapt from her chest when Rei’s bare hand came 
up suddenly and pressed up lightly against her fevered brow. Her nerves were suddenly alert, 
concentrating on the cool flesh. <i>Gah! She’s touching me! </i>Her feet instinctively 
flinched to shuffle back when the word ‘mission’ floated back to mind. <i>Wait a minute, 
what am I thinking? Isn’t this supposed to be a good thing? </i></p><p>“A fever.” Rei stated 
confidently before falling silent. She took a moment to stare at Hotaru in her arms, noting 
the discomfort on her face, before she threw a backward glance at Minako, who stared dumbly 
at her with a flush face.</p><p><i>At this rate, we’ll be finished before we even reach the 
palace. I guess we’ll have to take that route after all, but... I really didn’t want to go 
there again.</i></p><p>Minako watched Rei with great curiosity as the woman sudden wandered 
off to the side.</p><p>“Rei, where are you going? I thought we were supposed to go 
straight.” She pointed for emphasis.</p><p>Rei examined Minako with weary eyes. “That was 
the plan, but faced with these circumstances I decided it would be best if we took an 
alternative path. It’s faster and we’ll get to the palace in no time.”</p><p>“Are you saying 
that you knew a short cut and just decided not to use it?”</p><p>“Maybe.”</p><p>“Since, 
since, since way back when we first walked into the desert?” Minako could hardly believe her 
ears.</p><p>“Pretty much.”</p><p>“...STUPID REI!” Minako nearly screeched.</p><p>“What is it 
now?!”</p><p>“I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU! WE COULD HAVE GONE BACK RIGHT AWAY INSTEAD OF SUFFERING 
FROM THIS HEAT AND, AND, AND, Don’t you care about Hotaru at ALL? She’s only a kid and 
you’re having us wandering around unnecessarily! It’s bad for her health! In fact it’s bad 
for all of our health! Augh, never mind that, just look at you, you’re practically on the 
verge of collapse!” Minako shook her head. “Oh, I knew this was a bad idea. Here, let me 
take her for a bit, you’re obviously tired. Take some time to rest. You can show us the way 
while I’ll hold onto Hotaru and everything will be good. Okay...?” She finally breathed. 
There was something of a pained, exasperated expression on her face.</p><p>Rei blinked back 
with a blank stare. The woman’s words did have an effect, but not the one that she had been 
hoping for.</p><p><i>You’re on the verge of collapse? Everything will be good?</i></p><p>The 
words were as good as taking a shot at her pride. The Martian returned the comment with a 
cold, defiant glare.</p><p>“I don’t need your help!”</p><p>Although the response was 
something to be expected it didn’t mean that it was the one the blonde Goddess wanted to 
hear.</p><p>“Now you’re just being unreasonable. Why can’t you act more like you’re age? 
Don’t make me come over there and baby you,” She warned with thinning 
patience.</p><p>“You’re one to talk.”</p><p>“Excuse me? I’M the one to talk? I’m starting to 
get sick and tired of this attitude! Why won’t you let people help you? Or is it that you 
don’t trust me? I can understand if that’s the case but you had no excuse to brush Zen off 
the way you did.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Argh, I can’t believe you!” Minako threw her hands up 
in the air. “Don’t you even know your subordinates’ names?!”</p><p>Actually, Rei did- very 
well in fact. However, her stubbornness wasn’t about to allow her royal-pain-in-the-rear-end 
get an edge on her that easily.</p><p>“He was the man who was trying to tell you to get 
patched up, a trained medic at that! Do you have a death wish or something? And don’t you 
even think of telling me that it’s the ‘Martian Way’ because I just don’t buy that load of 
crap.”</p><p>Rei felt her body shake as rage began to consume her. Her self-control had been 
steadily deteriorating from a combination of heat, muscle aches and pains, and fatigue, but 
now she was really ticked off. Minako’s words had caused the battle fire within Rei to flare 
up so greatly that it materialized again as a powerful aura surrounding the 
Martian.</p><p><i>What the hell do you know?! You’re just some stranger who walked into my 
life, my home, and all you’ve done is criticize our way of life!</i> <i>What gives you the 
right? You think you’re so special because you’re a Goddess but it’s really nothing special 
at all! </i></p><p><i>How dare you!</i></p><p>Noticing she had struck a nerve, more softly 
this time, Minako whispered, “I didn’t mean to make you angry. I just, people care about 
you... you know?”</p><p><i>You won’t trust me, even a little bit?</i></p><p>This time, her 
words had hit the mark. Everything that had been building up deep inside was washed away by 
a calm wave of sanity. Who was she about to label as her next, unlucky victim? Just another 
diplomat; just a spoiled little girl from Venus, a person who didn’t possess a shred of 
knowledge about fighting other than what she had learned thus far in her stay. Rei suddenly 
felt ashamed for almost losing control so easily. What would have happened if she hadn’t 
been stopped and came back to her senses?</p><p>Rei took a deep breath and concentrated, 
bending her emotions with accordance to her will. Her aura died down and faded back inside 
her body. The atmospheric pressure around them lowered and everyone could breathe a little 
easier again.</p><p>Then in a relatively calm voice she answered Minako’s earlier question. 
“That’s that’s not it. It’s just... Don’t go around talking about something you can’t 
understand.”</p><p>“But if you told me I’m sure I could. How can I <i>not</i> understand? 
Sure, I may look like an airhead but I can be serious too.”</p><p>Silently, with her back 
facing Minako, Rei held up her hand and concentrated to form a small disc of red light into 
the palm of that hand.</p><p><i>Understand me huh? That’s a new one…</i> The red light in 
her hand began to revolve in a clockwise direction. If her hunch was correct, it should be 
right about here. <i>But that isn’t possible. No matter what you say, I refuse to allow 
myself to fall into the same trap as Haruka!</i></p><p>Minako tilted her head and peered 
curiously at her companion’s strange action.</p><p><i>What is she doing?</i></p><p>“Ha!” Rei 
thrust her hand into an invisible barrier, cracking a small surface. The rest of the light 
spread out from the indent and flew out and around, illuminating the once invisible wall. 
Minako could only watch in complete awe as a city began to materialize right before her 
eyes.</p><p>“Ahh…” <i>Oh wow! So I guess people really do live in the desert after 
all!</i></p><p>In a blink of an eye, large buildings replaced the desert. A market place 
filled with tents and booths bloomed within a large square where the four main roads 
intersected. The taller buildings, with their simple, white structures, appeared to contrast 
brightly against the red sand, the very place that their foundation was built upon, but the 
sighting of life forms lit a fire of curiosity within the Venusian 
Princess.</p><p><i>People! </i></p><p>There were women gathered in small groups outside the 
houses, young children running about and playing various games and activities, and to 
Minako’s surprise, there were even men bartering goods and having drinks in good nature 
within the market place. When images of the Martian Army came back to mind, she couldn’t 
help but wonder how a city of war could be so peaceful.</p><p><i>I thought everyone would be 
a part of the army or something. There were so many men and women soldiers, and these people 
have battles frequently… Where else could they get their soldiers from? </i></p><p>Farther 
down their line of vision, beyond the city square, was the Ram Palace- their 
destination.</p><p>“Surprised?” Rei prodded.</p><p>Minako weakly nodded. “Yeah, but... what 
did you do exactly? Where did this all come from? It wasn’t here a minute ago, and certainly 
not when I first arrived!” Rei blinked and gave her a skeptical ‘are you kidding?’ look. 
“What? No, seriously! I don’t know what just happened! Is it a type of magic or 
something?”</p><p>Taking this new information into careful consideration, Rei could only 
come up with one possible explanation for this.</p><p>“Well, if you’ve never seen this kind 
of thing before, then it must mean that Venus doesn’t have the system installed. Everyone 
other planet has it as far as I know. Huh. Ah well, what should I have expected from the 
planet of ‘love’?”</p><p>“Stop teasing me. What kind of system are you talking about?” 
Minako huffed. The woman also noticed how Rei was subtly trying to draw the attention away 
from Hotaru. But as much as Minako would’ve liked to ‘ding’ the Martian for it, she instead 
placed that thought on a temporary hold.</p><p>“Okay I’m listening, so lay it on me oh great 
leader of Mars.”</p><p><i>Hmph. Smart ass.</i></p><p>“I’m talking about the Planet Core 
Defence System, or otherwise known as the PCDS. Is it still not ringing a bell, Princess?” 
Seeing the blank stare she was receiving from Minako, she logically deduced that the answer 
must have been a ‘no’.</p><p><i>Erm…. I guess not then. </i>Sighing inwardly, she felt the 
oncoming headache as she attempted to elaborate further.</p><p>“All right, if you want to 
know then you better listen up, because I’m only going to explain this to you once. In the 
past, all of the planets used to be united under a common name. But one day, some Gods and 
Goddesses decided to go separate ways, and because of it, you have the two alliances that we 
have today: one of these is the Inner Alliance. This involves Mercury and Mars. The other 
alliance is the Outer Alliance, which is collaboration between Uranus and Neptune. So far, 
only Venus and Jupiter are officially considered to be neutral planets.” Rei paused and 
glanced at Minako, almost daring the woman to say something. Minako, on the other hand, 
innocently blinked back. She wasn’t sure what the Martian expected from her but she was 
still anxious to hear the rest of the story.</p><p><i>Yeah, like the people of love would 
want to join in the fight. </i>Rei resisted the urge to roll her eyes. <i>Well, that’s one 
possibility for her visit down. What else could she possibly want from 
us?</i></p><p>“Anyway, because we’re always fighting, we requested Mercury to construct a 
cloaking system for our cities. Out of all the inhabited planets, well, except for Venus, we 
were the last ones to receive the technology. The whole point of it is to have a means to 
protect the planet’s citizens from an unexpected ambush if there ever is one. It’s like 
creating a separate dimension just for this purpose. When it’s activated, you’ll walk 
through the city like it wasn’t there. That’s why you thought it was an empty desert when 
you first arrived. The same goes for the people inside of the barrier; they won’t know where 
you are or even of your existence while the barrier is in place.”</p><p>Minako looked 
thoughtful.</p><p><i>I wonder if we really don’t have something like that on Venus. It 
sounds like a good thing from what I’m hearing about it so far. Surely Mother knows about 
this? I mean, Rei just said that every other planet has it. </i>Minako paused. The digested 
information suddenly seemed flawed.</p><p><i>Wait</i>…<i>every other planet has 
it?</i></p><p>“Hey, didn’t you just say that practically every planet has it now? If your 
ally created it, then how did everyone else get it too?”</p><p>“We let them have 
it.”</p><p>“Oh I see, well that makes sens—Wait! You mean you LET everyone else have it? But 
wouldn’t that be a disadvantage to you?”</p><p>“You’ve noticed that huh? Well, why not?” Rei 
shrugged. “Our soldiers have no interest in picking a fight with the weak and defenceless. 
And every planet has the right to try to protect their citizens. Besides, battles always 
take place on battlefields, not civilian concentrated cities.”</p><p>Minako was still a 
little confused but she nodded just the same. <i>Then what’s the whole point to war? Wasn’t 
it to kill or conquer or something like that? But it’s not? Hmm…I still don’t get it. I 
don’t get this at all.</i></p><p>“You’ll understand it later. Maybe as we pass through the 
place.” Rei offered.</p><p>“Maybe…”</p><p><i>Sometimes I wonder how much I can truly 
understand…</i> Minako quietly confessed to herself. This wasn’t going according to plan at 
all.</p><p>“Well, then I guess we should get going.”</p><p>Rei turned to go but was stopped 
by a sudden tapping on her shoulder guards. When the Martian Commander turned around she 
instantly found Minako in her face, smiling dangerously, and one hand clutching her bare arm 
firmly, bringing Rei to wince due to her sunburn.</p><p>“Ah, ah, ah, <i>first</i> hand over 
the kid.” Minako chirped. “You really didn’t think I’d forget now, did you?”</p><p>Rei 
twitched.</p><p><u>(Down in the market place)</u></p><p>Hotaru heard the ruckus pick up 
around them, and gave a small yawn as she stretched and sat up to see what was so 
interesting. What she saw brought an angelic smile to her face; there were so many funny 
dressed people and brilliantly flashing colours of fabric hanging from the nearby booths. 
She couldn’t resist bouncing in Minako’s arms as she earnestly pointed at the people and 
structures that they passed by. Hotaru’s occasional bursts of squeals drew some curious 
stares in their direction. But regardless of what her people thought, whether they thought 
the child was like herself, one of their own, Rei knew that they were only capable of seeing 
Hotaru as the epitome of childhood innocence. For a brief moment, she had nearly convinced 
herself of that as well. If only it weren’t for Haruka’s cryptic message...</p><p>“Man?” She 
pointed at a passing stranger.</p><p>“No silly, that’s a WO-man.” Minako giggled at the girl 
in her arms. “Or, at least I think they are. That clothing…tsk.”</p><p>“Minako!” Rei chided, 
her loud voice brought her two charges to flinch in response. Hotaru, she could understand 
but Minako as well? “What did I just tell you about behaving in the city?”</p><p>“Umm… Gosh 
Rei, I can’t remember. Haha. What do you know?”</p><p>“Are. You. SeRiOuS?”</p><p>“No being 
bad.” Hotaru chirped.</p><p>“SEE? At least SOMEONE was listening!”</p><p>Minako averted her 
gaze and puckered her lips. <i>Hmph, okay. So maybe I should’ve been listening a little more 
carefully.</i></p><p>“The point is that you have to use common sense,” Rei lectured on. 
“Like try not to piss other people off. They don’t like to be criticized, even if you are 
disguised as a soldier.”</p><p>“Okay, okay. I’ll behave myself. Scouts 
honour.”</p><p>“That’s what you said last time!”</p><p>“But I mean it THIS time. Right 
Hotaru?”</p><p>Hotaru peered up at the blonde and then back at her irritated guardian. She 
thought about it for a moment and then quickly shook her head.</p><p>“HEY!” Minako 
protested.</p><p>But Minako’s shouts weren’t the only ones that filled the air just 
then.</p><p>“Hey! There she is! Catch her!”</p><p>“Don’t let her get away!”</p><p>Ahead of 
the trio, a crowd of men jumped to their feet and swarmed the pathway. Their clumsy bodies 
moved awkwardly around in circles trying to nab something in the middle.</p><p>“I wonder 
what’s going on?” Minako tightened her hold on Hotaru, hoping this wouldn’t scare the girl. 
But Hotaru appeared more calm and collected than her current guardian.</p><p>“A girl?” She 
pointed.</p><p>Rei glanced down at Hotaru before shooting her gaze back to the crowd. 
Concentrating ahead between the waists of the men her amethyst eyes caught a quick movement. 
Focusing in on the blur she made out a long dark-brown ponytail, dark clothes and then 
finally the face of a child.</p><p>The image was so startling that Rei instinctively took a 
step back. She could feel her headache growing. <i>Geh…</i> Rei winced. <i>Damn 
it!</i></p><p>“Rei, we’ve got to help her!” Minako also spotted the girl. “Can’t you do 
something? Call them off or do whatever you do.”</p><p>“Don’t give me orders!” Rei 
growled.</p><p>“AH!”</p><p>The girl had bumped into one of her pursuers and bounced 
backwards off-balance into the swarm.</p><p><i>Oh no!</i> Panic shot through her. Her dark 
eyes were squeezed shut as she felt her fall slow down in mid-air. Fear ravaged her small 
body with an animal-like frenzy. <i>I-I’m done for? No!! I can’t die now! I don’t want to 
die!</i></p><p>She hit the ground and instinctively recoiled as the hands shot 
forward.</p><p><i>Nng!</i></p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>The girl, trembling slightly, forced her 
gaze up to see the large men parting for a woman?</p><p>“It’s the Commander!” One of the men 
shouted.</p><p>“Sir, this child here-”</p><p>“Stand down.” Rei strode forward with power 
radiating all around her. Although she was missing her arm guards and was still covered with 
blood from her wound, the men were all very intimidated by her presence. They could not 
sense weakness, only massive power.</p><p>“You’re asking us to stop? If I may be so humble, 
may we ask why? We were only doing our job. By Martian law, all orphans must be drafted into 
the army, isn’t that correct?”</p><p>Rei analyzed the girl on the ground with cold eyes. She 
was met with an intense, defiant gaze of dark amethyst like her own, only Rei’s were 
darker.</p><p>“I will deal with this.” Rei commanded.</p><p>“B-But-”</p><p>“Do you have a 
problem with obeying orders?” She snapped.</p><p>“No! Of course not! P-Please forgive me 
Sir.”</p><p>“Then you’re all dismissed.”</p><p>“Yes Sir.” They all saluted and then ran 
off.</p><p><b>Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!</b></p><p>Once the men had vanished, Minako breathed a 
sigh of relief. “Whew, I’m glad that’s over with. They sure looked scary…”</p><p>Hotaru 
nodded in agreement, but Rei hadn’t said anything at all; the Martian had yet to shift her 
gaze away from the child before her.</p><p>“Do you know why they were chasing her? Poor 
thing…” Minako bent down and extended her hand. “Are you okay?”</p><p>The girl stubbornly 
turned her head away and tried to ignore the Goddess.</p><p>“Hey, that’s not very nice.” She 
said in hurt voice. “What do you think Hotaru? She sure looks older than you, but it can’t 
be by very much. Maybe you can be friends?”</p><p>“Girl?” Hotaru blinked and pointed again. 
This apparently caught the other girl’s attention.</p><p>“Of course I’m a girl! Are you 
blind?”</p><p>“So you can talk.” Minako smirked in victory.</p><p>“O-Of course I can. What 
do you expect? Look, I don’t know who you people are but you’re wasting your time if you 
think I’m going to grovel on my knees and shower you with praise!”</p><p>Rei didn’t bat an 
eye but continued to stare in deep thought.</p><p>“You didn’t have to save me, you know. I 
could’ve taken care of myself!”</p><p>“I see.” The Martian leader finally mumbled. However 
this calm response unnerved the girl even further.</p><p><b>Tup!</b></p><p>“Hey!” Minako 
cried when the girl dashed past her and disappeared into the crowd. “Jeez, that’s some 
gratitude for ya isn’t it? Are you all right Hotaru?” Hotaru nodded. “You know, that was a 
pretty disrespectful thing to do to her planet’s leader. I wonder how Ares would have 
reacted to something like that. What do you think Rei? ...Rei?” Minako noticed that Rei had 
started to walk in the opposite direction the girl had just gone.</p><p>“Where are you 
going?”</p><p><i>If she is an orphan… </i>“Follow me and stay close.”</p><p><u>(Further into 
the city)</u></p><p>The girl that had fled from the trio panted for air as she sprinted 
through the dry, dusty streets. Small clouds of dust shot up with each and every step she 
took towards her sanctuary, to the only home that she had now.</p><p>The crowd soon thinned 
and became nearly non-existent when she finally reached it, a small corner alleyway that led 
into an even smaller hide-a-way just barely above the alley wall. Using the convenient 
passage entrance, the child infiltrated deep into the inside of a deserted building. Her 
heart pounded in her chest the entire way, even as she squeezed through the narrow 
passageway and dropped down into her shelter. She coughed as she hit the ground, the drop 
always, inevitably, brought some pain to her ankles.</p><p>For reassurance she scanned the 
room. What little scant belongings left behind from the only family she had lay strewn 
across the dusty, wooden table before her. To the near-side wall, there was a pathetic 
looking, sickly green cabinet and to the far side corner of the room was a broken chair. She 
never knew how it became like that. It was simply just there like herself.</p><p><i>That was 
close…</i> She wheezed, feeling the burn of the chase lingering in her lungs. Unconsciously 
she attempted to wipe the forming beads of sweat on her brow. <i>They almost had me. 
Again…</i></p><p>“So you’ve finally made it.”</p><p>The girl’s heart skipped a beat. She 
whirled on the spot towards the voice to see the raven-haired woman and her blonde companion 
eyeing her with a watchful gaze.</p><p>“W-What are you doing here?!” She demanded. She was 
too frightened to move.</p><p>The girl nervously watched the Martian woman cross across the 
room into the corner where the broken chair sat. She touched one of the jagged 
pieces.</p><p>“What do you want? How did you find me?”</p><p>“How did I find you?” Rei 
repeated slowly. Her eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p><i><u>(Flashback)</u></i></p><p>“<i>I 
don’t believe it! How did you find me?” A young girl with messed, long raven hair and 
battered, dark garments demanded.</i></p><p><i>She glared up into her opponent’s face with 
defiant amethyst eyes. He was a full-grown man, a God in fact, the very leader of Mars. 
Ares. With a sword hanging from his hip and a shield attached to his back, he stared down at 
the child with an amused expression.</i></p><p><i>Despite the power radiating from this 
stranger, the girl forced herself to still her trembling and gripped her only weapon, a 
broken table leg, tighter. Her mouth set itself into a thin line of 
determination.</i></p><p>“<i>Would you rather have been taken away like the others before 
you?” His coal black eyes wandered around the desolate atmosphere. “It appears you have been 
left behind.”</i></p><p>“<i>Shut up!”</i></p><p><i>Ares raised an 
eyebrow.</i></p><p>“<i>Who’s fault do you think that is? Having soldiers drag orphans away 
to a war, where they’ll either die or come back and start a family before being called off 
again to die for real! How do you think orphans come around in the first 
place?”</i></p><p>“<i>Do you think Mar’s leader is irresponsible?”</i></p><p><i>The girl 
looked square into the War God’s eyes and growled, “Yes!”</i></p><p><i>An awkward silence 
ensued. The agonizing tension wasn’t broken until Ares finally took the initiative with a 
step towards the child, and she attacked. Instead of turning her back and running as she’d 
done before she lashed out as a cornered animal would. Being consumed with fear, instinct 
kick in and she rebelled against the threat with such urgency that only came through 
believing her survival and life was on the line.</i></p><p><i>The piece of wood came up and 
she struck Ares in the leg. The God barely flinched. He darted down to grab her, throwing 
his hand out, only to have it withdraw empty aside from the newly gained 
scratch.</i></p><p>“<i>HaaaAH!”</i></p><p><b>WHAP!</b></p><p><i>The War God gazed at the 
reddening mark developing atop of his palm. “A fast child indeed…” He muttered. “What’s your 
name?”</i></p><p>“<i>None of your business!” She whirled around for a second 
round.</i></p><p><i>But the girl’s remark was cut short when a strong aura gripped and 
paralyzed her. She blinked to see the stranger in front of her glowing 
red.</i></p><p>“<i>W-What…t-the…” She stammered.</i></p><p>“<i>I asked you what your name 
was. You do have one, don’t you?”</i></p><p><i>The girl struggled some more but discovered 
it was useless against the invisible pressure.</i></p><p>“<i>Grr… Rei.” The girl reluctantly 
answered. The spell around her immediately broke and she fell to the floor onto her knees, 
feeling suddenly weak and tired. After going three days without food, her energy was 
depleted. She had already been pushed to her limits at the start of the chase and then past 
them at the start of the fight. It was a miracle that she was still able to hold herself up 
on her knees and Ares knew it.</i></p><p><i>There was little movement from the child as the 
man walked to up where she sat.</i></p><p>“<i>Rei is it? Well then, Rei… Why don’t you come 
with me?” He outstretched his injured hand.</i></p><p><i><u>(End of 
Flashback)</u></i></p><p>Uneasily, the girl then watched as the Martian woman crossed the 
room to the cabinet and opened one of its drawers. It was bare inside, except for a stale 
loaf of bread. It was likely something the girl had shop-lifted. Rei had to inwardly grin at 
that.</p><p>“Hey, don’t touch that!”</p><p>Rei slowly turned to face her. She held the loaf 
up for everyone to see. “Where did you get this?”</p><p>“I...”</p><p>“Did you steal 
it?”</p><p>“Grr... Like I had much choice...” The girl mumbled through gritted 
teeth.</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>“You already know the answer to that, so why even bother 
asking? What the hell do you want anyway? If you want the bread, you can just take it. Just 
leave me alone.”</p><p>“This? You really think I’d come all this way for this?” Rei 
half-tossed it back into the bin, never giving it a second look.</p><p>“Then why <i>are</i> 
you here?”</p><p>The woman took a few steps forward, forcing the girl to unconsciously back 
away into a nearby wall.</p><p>“I was curious. What do you have against joining the Martian 
army? Don’t you know at least in the army you’ll be fed, clothed, taken care of... and be 
honoured as one of the planet’s protectors?”</p><p>“Big deal! What’s the point if people are 
just going to die?”</p><p>“Why indeed.”</p><p>“Rei, you don’t mean to tell me you came all 
this way to force her into the army,” Minako said worriedly. “If she doesn’t want to go, 
then why make her? She’s only a child.”</p><p>“But that’s when training is the best,” Rei 
remarked with a piercing look. “The earlier you start training, the more time a soldier will 
have to hone their skills. People who begin when they’re children will master their art at a 
younger age- they’ll be superior in strength to ordinary children who’ve unnecessarily 
delayed. If she stays here, she will be forced to survive against starvation and 
loneliness.”</p><p>“I won’t get lonely!”</p><p>Rei ignored the angry outburst. “There is 
nothing for you here. It’s as simple as that.”</p><p>“Stop talking like you know what it’s 
like! That armor you’re wearing, that means you’re one of them! Have you ever been an 
orphan? Have you ever lost your entire family and had to watch your friends being dragged 
off before your eyes? Well, have you?!”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“Yeah... that’s what I thought. 
For all I know, my friends could be dead.”</p><p>Minako felt herself inwardly cringe at the 
statement. What was the casualty count from the last battle again? One hundred? Two 
hundred?</p><p>“What’s your name?” Rei inquired.</p><p>The girl mumbled.</p><p>“Speak 
up!”</p><p>There was an unsettling silence as the two stared at each other until the younger 
girl relented against Rei’s will.</p><p>“M-My name is Nozomi...no last name. I’m ten years 
old.” She added.</p><p>“What is it that you want? Do you want friends? Power...? 
Shelter...?”</p><p>Nozomi looked away. Who wouldn’t want all of that?</p><p>“Then why don’t 
you come with me?”</p><p>“Rei?” Minako asked quizzically. She was almost as surprised as 
Nozomi was at this offer.</p><p>“Are you deaf? I told you that not going to join the 
army!”</p><p>“My name is Rei, but many simply refer to me as Commander or Sir. I am the 
current leader of Mars.” Rei watched the girl’s eyes widen at this. The statement had shut 
her up completely. “This is my proposition. Come with me and live in the palace. I won’t ask 
you to join the army, BUT there is one condition. During your stay, I’ll require you to take 
up training lessons like others who are in the military. After five years, if you can prove 
yourself stronger than your soldier counterparts, then you won’t have to join indefinitely. 
You’re free to do whatever you like. However... the same applies if you fail. If you find 
yourself weaker than the others, then you will be drafted. Does that sound fair to 
you?”</p><p>Rei could still remember her own childish voice in her memory asking, <i>‘Five 
years?’</i></p><p>"Five years?”</p><p>“That’s right, five years. What is your 
answer?”</p><p>Nozomi glanced around the dingy, damp room. Honestly, she really didn’t want 
to stay here. She was tired. She was tired of stealing, tired of being chased and beaten. 
After watching her life disappear before her very eyes, she thought it would be kind of nice 
not to have to confront that sort of helplessness again.</p><p>The girl turned her head and 
saw Hotaru still cuddled up in Minako’s arms. It was the same woman who had accompanied the 
Martian leader before. Maybe this couldn’t be so bad?</p><p>She met Rei’s confident eyes 
with her own dark ones.</p><p><i>I’ve got nothing else to lose...</i></p><p>“Okay, you’ve 
got a deal. I’ll come with you for now… Sir.”</p><p><u>(Ram Palace, Early evening</u>,<u> 
Minako’s Room)</u></p><p>“YES! We’re finally back!” Minako fell onto her bed and cuddled 
into the soft sheets, sighing with content. “I missed this place.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>“Oh 
come on, you can’t say you didn’t miss this place Rei-bear. I mean, we got your wound looked 
at, Hotaru and Nozomi are being taken care of by some of the maids and now we’ve got some 
alone time.” She winked.</p><p>But Rei missed the hidden meaning in the last sentence. 
“Uh-huh.” She muttered.</p><p>“I think I’ll take a bath.”</p><p>“Uh-huh.”</p><p>“Or 
actually, a swim in the hot tub might really hit the spot instead. What do you 
think?”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“…The sky is falling.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Minako frowned. <i>Is 
that all she’s going to say? </i>“I’m going to strip in front of you and you will like 
it.”</p><p>“Uh-hu—WHAT?” Rei snapped her head in Minako’s direction with wide 
eyes.</p><p>“Ah-ha! I thought that’d get your attention space cadet! I was wondering, just 
how <i>did</i> you know where Nozomi would go? That place was pretty secluded.”</p><p>Rei 
shrugged.</p><p>“Is it one of those Martian abilities? It’s okay if it is, that’s really 
cool you know.”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“Rei?”</p><p>“Let me tell you something about Mars, 
Minako. There’s only one thing that matters here and that’s strength. Unlike on your home 
planet, family and blood ties are very disposable. Here, if you’re strong, then that’s all 
that matters.”</p><p>“And since you’re strong, that’s good right?”</p><p>Rei gave a tired 
yawn. “I guess... Now if you will excuse me, I will leave you to your 
business.”</p><p><i>Hmm…</i> “Yeah, you really do need a rest. I bet you’re dying for some 
sleep huh? Just imagine! If poor Rei-bear doesn’t get enough sleep then she’ll get gray 
hairs.” (Heart)</p><p><i>Staying around you will give me gray hairs. </i>Rei mentally 
retorted. “And stop calling me that!”</p><p>“Calling you what?” Minako blinked 
innocently.</p><p>“Rei-- You know what I mean!” The Martian sighed. “Anyway, I need to be 
going. There’s something important I need to deal with.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“So if you need 
anything call a maid.” She opened the door on her way out.</p><p>“You mean you’re going to 
leave me all alone?” Minako followed after her. “But what if I get lonely? What if I miss 
Rei-- I mean, you. Just Rei.”</p><p>“Excuse me?” Rei raised an eyebrow. “This is going to be 
your first night here and you’re already saying you can’t sleep in a room by yourself? What 
did you do back at home?”</p><p>“I--Well, don’t tell anyone but... I had a teddy bear okay?” 
She blushed.</p><p>Rei stared. <i>A Goddess needs a teddy bear to get to sleep at 
night?</i></p><p>“But I left him back at home.” <i>I didn’t expect on staying around for so 
long. </i>Minako silently scolded her own assumptions. “And I get horrible, dreadful 
nightmares when I sleep alone.”</p><p>“So what? What do you want me to do about it? Fly a 
personal shuttle to Venus and pick it up for you?”</p><p>Minako pouted. 
“No.”</p><p>“Theeeeen...you want me to stay with you?” She just had this funny 
feeling.</p><p><i>More like sleep with me but close enough. </i>“Oh, however did you guess?” 
Minako dramatically exclaimed, feigning shock. This made Rei go red in the face; the Martian 
always seemed to know when she was being made fun of, Minako had to give her credit for 
that.</p><p>“Would you? Pleeeeeeease?” Minako gave a pleading look.</p><p>“Fine, whatever.” 
There couldn’t be any possible harm to sleeping in the same room. “But I’ve got to get going 
now. You better not be fooling around or do anything really stupid by the time I get back. 
Got it?”</p><p>“Yes Sir.” The blonde saluted.</p><p>“Cut that out.”</p><p>“Bleh.” Minako 
stuck out her tongue.</p><p>Once Rei had left Minako waltzed back over to her bedroom and 
flopped atop of the sheets to ponder Rei’s earlier words.</p><p>“Hmm...So the people here 
only worry about strength huh? What a strange concept. Back at home it’s love that matters 
the most. Friends and family is the most important thing there… Now that I think about it, I 
kinda miss home.” Minako rolled over onto her side. <i>But then again… I don’t at the same 
time. The more time I spend here with Rei, the more I’m starting to like this place. Even if 
it’s only for a day, it feels like it’s been forever for me, but in a good way. 
</i></p><p>“I wonder what important thing Rei had to do anyway?”</p><p><b>CLANG! 
CLASH!</b></p><p>A sudden series of noises caught Minako’s attention. Out of curiosity she 
leapt off the bed and ran over to the nearest window. Outside the sun was only setting but 
the fighters below had only begun their exercises.</p><p><i>Rei...?</i></p><p>Rei held a 
practice sword firmly in her right hand. Minako immediately assumed the woman was briefing 
about the weapon because Rei continually pointed to different sections of the sword, working 
her way from top to bottom. Her two ‘students’ to Minako’s surprise were Hotaru and Nozomi. 
Both girls were watching with rapt attention as Rei began to show off a few of the moves she 
would teach them soon and those that they would learn later when they mastered the 
arts.</p><p>“So that’s what was so important?” Minako leaned into the side of the window. 
She quickly found herself caught up in the demonstration as well, unaware of the smile 
tugging at her face. “Well what do you know? O’l Rei really does have a soft spot after all, 
that stubborn girl…”</p><p><i>Strength is the only thing that matters? Pfft. </i>Minako let 
out a giggle.</p><p>“Silly Rei-bear...”</p>
