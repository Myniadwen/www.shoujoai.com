<h1>Opposites</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<pre>For someone who spent most of her time tapping on a computer keyboard, 
Ami had beautiful fingernails. Each one was at even length with the 
next, and her hands were so dainty and beautiful, that they were[besides 
the blue hair], the first thing people commented on.
 
Makoto&#146;s hands were different. Larger, with more scratches. Some of her 
nails were very, very stubby, while the others were long and well-kept. 
When asked by Minako[and Usagi, of course] why she didn&#146;t just file them 
all down to size, Makoto would explain that the others had simply broken 
off, and that she &#147;didn&#146;t have the heart to trim the others, when they 
had taken so long to grow.&#148;
 
Makoto liked the trees and nature. She loved the feeling of creating 
something, of helping things grow. Ami preferred the static, sterile 
environment of labs and computers, where everything was clear-cut, where 
she could experiment and go through trial and error. it was a challenge 
for her naturally quick mind.
 
Makoto liked the warm breezes of summer, the feel of the spring. She 
liked seeing the first flowers bloom, and she adored watching the sakura 
trees sprout their first blossoms of the season. Ami preferred fall and 
winter, where the air was so cold, it took your breath away. She liked 
to see the leaves gradually change from green to bright goldens and reds 
and oranges[and sometimes dull browns]. She liked the first snow of 
winter, where the sun bounced off the snow-covered branches and created 
a most beautiful picture.
 
Makoto liked the feel of battle, the thrill of hand-to-hand combat. She 
liked surprises in a fight, the challenge, and the feel of adrenaline 
replacing the blood in her veins. Ami liked to know what was happening. 
She liked strategy and tactics, maneuverability in a fight. She did not 
like enemy surprises, but surprising the enemy was always enjoyable. 

Ami would love to be in love, but she thinks her studies are more 
important, although sometimes she blushes when Usagi[and Minako, of 
course] ask her if she has a crush on someone. Makoto has been hurt by 
love, but she still holds on to the little hope she has left.
 
And sometimes, when Ami is busily typing on her laptop, Makoto sometimes 
says, out of the blue, 
 
&#147;You have beautiful hands.&#148;
 
Ami blushes and quietly says &#147;T-thank-you, Makoto,&#148; and Makoto gives her 
a silly grin, and Minako[and Usagi, of course] wonder why they just 
won&#146;t go and get a room.
