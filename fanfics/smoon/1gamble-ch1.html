<h1>One Last Gamble</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mysticmew.html">MysticMew</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I was a very good observer.
	If I wanted to pride myself with any special skills acquired 
throughout the years - or millennia - it was my perception ability. An 
ability vital to both my occupation as well as the role assigned to me 
in it. Especially in the midst of a battle, a sharp mind that could 
pick up tiny details seemingly unimportant and to process them all to 
form a plan of action on the fly, not based on long calculations but 
instinct alone, such a mindset was very helpful.
	And yet, I sometimes really hated it when it was involuntarily 
applied to social, non-crisis circumstances. I knew a lot of things 
that went on around me. About some of the little, mostly harmless, 
secrets kept, what bugged one of them. I HAD TO know this sort of 
thing. I was their leader after all, and a leader who did not know 
about these things and thus could not include this knowledge in 
decisions was going to fail fast and hard, usually dragging down those 
that he or she was supposed to lead.
	I hid it well, of course, under a mask of cheerful, bubbly 
happiness, not a care in the world, a mask that had taken long to 
construct and even longer to master. Once so easy, once a natural 
state, before Artemis, before my awakening, before my true self 
emerged. Just a happy, little, normal schoolgirl. A bit boy-crazy and 
not all too good in school unless it came down to PE and a few other 
things. A lie. I knew. But a lie I sometimes longed to return to, just 
for the sake of breaking out from the path of melancholy my life had 
taken, once again. It would have been so much easier to be blissfully 
unaware, then knowing the bitter, frustrating truth.
	The party had not at all &quot;winded down&quot;, just merely entered its 
&quot;let&#39;s all have our fun together&quot; instead of &quot;we are here to celebrate 
&lt;insert name&gt;&#39;s birthday&quot;. Not the cluster around one person, the 
actual focus of the evening, anymore. Now there were the familiar 
groups clustered together, sometimes straying to interact, mostly 
keeping to themselves. Not because there was any resentment in 
spending time with someone else but simply because that was how it 
was. Haruka and Michiru, Ami and Makoto subtly moving towards each 
other - not so subtly for me, mind you. Rei was keeping a little to 
herself, just as Setsuna was, both occasionally joining their 
respective circle, just as I would usually. And of course there was 
THEM.
	I had seen her slipping away almost instantly, standing a little 
to the side of the bustling activity. No one noticed. They usually 
didn&#39;t. I wondered if any of us truly understood her in the first 
place, what was really going on inside the young child-adult whose 
birthday we were celebrating today. Heck, no one had really bothered 
to even ask her how old she was now. It could have been answered in at 
least three different ways, with three different results. I was 
certain of that.
	She didn&#39;t like big, noisy events like that. That much I had 
been able to piece together. Not that she totally disapproved but she 
was the quiet type and preferred that quiet which wasn&#39;t all too 
surprising seeing as she was the Senshi of SILENCE. Hotaru was a 
rather private person, even after her rebirth, the typical domination 
by her alter ego that neither of us could really deny was there, even 
if we tried denying it often enough, clinging to the notion that our 
Senshi selves were the secret identity, not our everyday selves.
	And so, unnoticed as always, she slipped out of the room. But 
not before glancing up for a moment, purple eyes locking with my own, 
KNOWING that I was watching, and making me flinch from the emotions 
playing inside them for just a fleeting moment. Then she was gone, 
leaving the laughing and joking rest of the group behind to enjoy 
themselves, to enjoy their private time, mostly with their loved one.
	Which was the real problem here. A problem that I couldn&#39;t just 
SOLVE, because I doubted there was a SOLUTION. Maybe there wasn&#39;t even 
meant to be one. As saddening as that sounded.
	I cursed myself for turning my gaze away from the empty doorway, 
back to the room full of quiet talking, excited laughter, happy 
smiles, enjoyment, affection... love. Back to them, at the center of 
it all, back to HER. It was visible hard to keep the mask in place, it 
became harder and harder over time, and frankly I wasn&#39;t deluding 
myself in believing that it was good enough anymore. Little by little 
the mask had crumbled away. Some like Setsuna noticed, I think. Some 
just wondered over the change but didn&#39;t make the connection, would 
probably balk at the connection. The carefree, bubbly party girl was 
still there but these days I was more often Venus, leader of the 
Senshi, not finding the strength any longer to keep up the charade, 
not caring whether or not someone SAW.
	There she was, smiling, absorbed in her prince, her beloved, 
happy as she should be, practically glowing. A glow that was like a 
sun, almost painful to look at. And just like the sun that you 
couldn&#39;t look at directly without going blind, she appeared to me, 
always a little brighter, a little less unreachable she seemed to me. 
Our Princess, our hope, our savior...
	My eternal, ONE-SIDED love.
	CHIBA Tsukino Usagi. Princess Serenity, wife of Prince Endymion.
	Unreachable forever.
	I wasn&#39;t dating anymore. I haven&#39;t even tried since our return 
from the cauldron. I just couldn&#39;t find the energy anymore to continue 
the pretense, the false but SAFE image of boy-crazy Minako who 
couldn&#39;t manage one stable relationship. That had been better than 
showing the real reason, much better, much safer. It made the pain 
bearable, even if just by a little. I could delude others into 
thinking that I simply didn&#39;t have any luck in the dating apartment, I 
could delude myself into thinking that... for a while.
	Then there was the wedding, the happy, joyous occasion signaling 
the beginning of a new era, of the impending revival of old and 
renewed glory. I had smiled happily throughout it all, standing right 
next to my secret and only love, giving her the ring that would bind 
her to another. Another that made her happy, happier than I ever 
could. And for that I WAS happy.
	That didn&#39;t stop the pain though. The heartache I knew could 
never be cured. I might be selfless to a point, but not to an extreme 
where I refused to acknowledge what it did to me. I sometimes think 
she knew, suspected. Serenity knew, or at least I was pretty certain 
about it. However, what could she do? Nothing. You can&#39;t force love 
after all, and her heart had already been given to another. End of the 
story. Who says they always have to have a happy ending? For everyone 
involved I mean?
	But, the kami help me, how much I wished there would be one.
	Sharply I tore my gaze away. It had just lasted a couple of 
seconds but like always seemed to be an eternity. I didn&#39;t need her 
catching me. I didn&#39;t need to see the confusion and worry or even 
worse, the pity in these sparkling blue eyes. She was happy as it was. 
And as much as this situation hurt, I&#39;d rather die a thousand deaths 
inside than taking that away from her. She was too precious for me.
	This couldn&#39;t continue as it was anyway. The situation had 
become unbearable for some time now. And ironically it hadn&#39;t been 
Usagi who had brought it to the boiling point, to a point where I KNEW 
I had to do SOMETHING about this. No, it wasn&#39;t the bright light of 
our and especially my life. The light that we were all drawn to and 
that I could have easily lost myself in if it had been all there was 
to it. No, it hadn&#39;t been Usagi.
	I glanced back at the empty doorway through which Hotaru had 
vanished moments ago. Like her namesake, a firefly scared away by the 
bright light, tiny in comparison, fleeing to somewhere where her glow 
could actually be seen.
	It was a miracle I hadn&#39;t even noticed. A miracle or a curse. I 
wasn&#39;t entirely sure about that. I had no clue when it started. It was 
there though and I couldn&#39;t deny it, could not NOT understand what it 
was because the situation was so painfully similar... no, scratch 
that, it was painfully identical, catching me somewhere in between and 
upon the realization leaving me with no clue what to do about it. The 
one impossibility in front, the other behind me, forming a string of 
pain and heartache with only Usagi finding any real happiness, 
ironically outside of the string itself.
	I had really thought I was strong enough. That I could just 
submit to this. Always silent, always in the background, watching, 
loving, but not touching for the fear, no, the very close reality of 
burning my fingers. I believed I could have been happy for her, I 
believed it would be alright, that I could love without needing to be 
loved back.
	Until I started watching... observing Hotaru. Lurking in the 
shadows, her light like a single star trying to even see her companion 
within the bright glare of a super nova. Just like me. A mirror of the 
same loneliness, the same suppressed, silent longing. Expressed 
differently since we were radical different people but nonetheless the 
same basic principle. And just like Usagi, I couldn&#39;t just &quot;make it 
right&quot;, I couldn&#39;t just turn around one hundred and eighty degree and 
&quot;make it right&quot;. Oh, that would be easy. I could probably delude 
myself again for awhile that it was better, that I could be happy for 
a change with someone else. An easy solution, one I could justify with 
at least doing Hotaru some good.
	A lie again, though. A lie to myself, and to her as well. It 
wouldn&#39;t be honest, it wouldn&#39;t work out in the end and just produce 
more pain, more unseen tears at night, more desperate longing that 
could never be answered. I couldn&#39;t just decide to love someone. It 
didn&#39;t work like that. Sure, I was flattered, maybe even curious. But 
hell, I barely knew Hotaru. As I mentioned earlier, I doubted any of 
us really KNEW her, not even her self-appointed parents who were 
barely older mentally IF you ignored her alter ego. I couldn&#39;t just 
snap my fingers and create feelings for her.
	Nevertheless...
	Something had to be done.
	Something had to change.
	And it had to change NOW. Crystal Tokyo wasn&#39;t far away and if 
something &#39;good&#39; had come out of noticing Hotaru&#39;s affection towards 
me, it was that I couldn&#39;t hide, couldn&#39;t run anymore from the fact 
that, continuing the way I had, would, no, was already affecting my 
judgment. I was their leader, SHE trusted me. I knew, I felt it deep 
down in my heart, that I would be doing something incredible foolish 
one day if I didn&#39;t get a grip on this. I had to do SOMETHING because 
continuing to do NOTHING would end up disastrous for sure.
	I glanced down at the tickets in my hands that I had 
unconsciously pulled out of my bag, and then up again, at the open 
doorway, bouncing back to the royal couple now dancing and returning 
to the hallway.
	I had always been good at relying on my gut, my instincts. In 
life, as well as in battle. Intuition was my greatest strength. Oh 
sure, they had hammered battle strategies into my mind during my past 
life until I could recite them in my sleep, however, in the end they 
would wind up bend and altered as the situation required them... if I 
used them at all. I never really knew that what I decided to do, would 
be successful. Yet, I believed, and it usually turned out all right, 
especially when it really mattered.
	And just like that, I had no freaking idea if this would work. 
Like I said, logically seen I couldn&#39;t just force myself to change 
overnight. To drop my love for one and turn to another. And I had no 
delusions that this would happen. IF, then only slow, agonizingly 
slow, a path traveled that was going upwards and upwards and upwards, 
like swimming against the current and not ever considering to turn 
back, because every time you did it would push you even further 
towards the waterfall at the end. A path I had to take simply because 
falling back again was no option.
	Closing my eyes, I hid a tear and turned away. I would always 
love her. Even if somehow I could manage to pull this off, my feelings 
would always be there, feelings that couldn&#39;t just be terminated.
	Yet, I resolved with a FINAL glance at my too bright light, the 
intoxicating, unreachable object of my heart for many years, over two 
lifetimes, I knew I had to go. I had to say goodbye. For a new 
beginning, there first had to be an ending. And achieving that end 
could not, would NEVER happen when I stayed in HER close proximity. 
And even resisting that pull, separating from it by sheer willpower, 
it would not guarantee immunity the moment I returned, not even 
immunity while I was away. I could only try. I needed to try.
	One last, desperate gamble. One last crazy attempt at dating 
from Aino Minako. Except this time I vowed that it would be a honest 
one.
	With that resolution, made up that very moment - even though it 
had been on my mind for several weeks now, being the reasons for the 
ticketS - I squared my shoulders, gaze fixed ahead, not daring to look 
back, I walked out of the door, following the pale light of the 
firefly unnoticed in the glare of the other, far dominant one.
	I could only hope this worked out. And I could only hope that 
she would be willing to even go along with this crazy idea, seemingly 
condemned to fail from the very start. Ironic, wasn&#39;t it? It had been 
Usagi who was the very incarnation of hope and yet here I had turn 
away from just that, in order to find another kind of hope. One that 
wouldn&#39;t swallow me, that wouldn&#39;t burn me. Another path, another 
softer kind of light.
	&#39;Artemis will freak when he finds out,&#39; I thought to myself with 
a bittersweet smile as I slipped out into the night where she sat as 
if waiting just for me. Maybe she was. I&#39;d find out soon.

THE END

not...
