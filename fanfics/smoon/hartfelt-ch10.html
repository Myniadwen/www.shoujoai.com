<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 10 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><p>The group was led down a central path of the city, walking for what seemed to be forever 
until a large structure came into view. Looming overhead protectively, as a guardian would 
to its treasure, there was a pure white, marble building that stood atop of a tall cliff 
overlooking the city of Caelus. At this time of day the sun appeared to be shining directly 
behind the building, casting a shadow of strange light over the majestic landmark.</p><p>“If 
we take this way, it won’t be for too much longer,” Baroach promised. Though the group was 
more concerned about how they were going to scale that unavoidable cliff.</p><p>To their 
good fortune, there was a collective sigh of relief to see that they weren’t going to scale 
the cliff with their bare hands. As they drew nearer a spiralled staircase came into clear 
view. From first glance it was a long, narrow path that was marked by a metal rail to the 
side. It acted much like the broken pieces of shield around the edges of the island; it was 
there to prevent possible accidents.</p><p><b>Tup, tup, 
tup…</b></p><p><b>…</b><b>ping…</b></p><p>Mid-way through their climb, Rei abruptly paused 
for a moment and threw a questioning gaze back towards the city. The wind brushed her long 
hair to the side, playing mischievously with the dark coloured strands, and, in effect, had 
cast a shadow over the Martian’s darkened eyes. The change in the woman’s aura, however, 
hadn’t gone entirely unnoticed by the party. Being the one to be lingering a few steps 
behind Rei, Minako had almost bumped into the woman when she abruptly stopped.</p><p><b>Tup, 
tup-- </b></p><p><i>WOAH!</i></p><p><b>tuu-u-u-up.</b></p><p>“Rei! Why did you just stop 
like that? I almost ran into you! Okay, maybe I forgot to mention this, but I have this 
thing against...heights, you know? I mean, it looks like a looooong way down from here. So, 
could you please be a little more careful?!”</p><p><i>I don’t feel like becoming a squashed 
pancake anytime soon</i>!</p><p>But when Rei didn’t respond, the Venusian Princess drew back 
and tilted her head to the side to get a better view of her companion’s face. The Martian 
was absolutely rigid, which was a very bad sign in her books.</p><p>“Uhh... Rei? Heelloooo, 
Minako to Rei, is something wrong? Everyone will leave us behind if we don’t keep moving.” A 
little bit more than worried now, she tugged at Rei’s unresponsive hand. It wasn’t until 
then that she realized how cold her hand was. <i>Oh! </i><i>They feel like ice! </i>Minako 
suppressed the urge to let go. “Look, if it’ll make you happy you can call me your maid—but 
talk to me already! Are you mad at me or something?”</p><p>Rei listlessly pulled out of her 
grip and maintained her silence. She appeared to be squinting at some invisible opponent and 
listening for a non-existent sound. Minako decided that this wasn’t getting her anywhere. 
Instead of trying to make contact with the ‘unmovable’ force, she invested her energy into 
listening for what the other woman apparently heard. After a minute or two, she began to 
wonder if Rei had somehow lost her mind. She honestly did try, but she could only hear the 
sounds of the whispering wind. It never occurred to her that Rei actually <i>was</i> 
listening to the wind.</p><p><b>Ssssssssshhhhhhhhhh…</b></p><p>“No, it’s nothing,” Rei 
finally said. Sighing loudly, the woman shook her head and then quickly resumed climbing the 
steps (followed by a very confused Venusian). The blonde almost opened her mouth to question 
what Rei was doing when she suddenly felt cold. It felt like the temperature of the air 
around her had plummeted twenty degrees.</p><p><i>Ah! So cold! B-B-But where it is coming 
from? It’s not the wind is it?</i></p><p>However, she was uncomfortably for only a fleeting 
moment. The moment Rei’s hardened gaze turned to her, the feeling fled with hurried haste. 
Minako momentarily wobbled, but quickly caught her balance once again against the rail. She 
had felt unusual things before, but never to that intensity.</p><p><b>Tup… tup… 
tup…</b></p><p><i>I don’t want to worry Minako… </i>Rei thought to herself as they climbed 
the stairs. <i>But for a moment there, it felt like we were being watched.</i> Something 
about the feeling deeply disturbed her. It didn’t feel like a curious, watchful gaze that 
she came to expect from her troops, but, rather, something much more sinister, as a hunter 
would to its prey.</p><p><i>Only one more reason to stay on guard,</i> Rei 
noted.</p><p>Successful with their trek, the group found themselves standing face to face 
with the great palace of Uranus. Much like the cliff, they were greeted by a sight that none 
of them could have fully appreciated from where there they had landed in the city. The 
palace walls, for instance, appeared to be engraved with golden markings that appeared to be 
telling wise advice in their own cryptic language. But for what they lacked in communication 
with the foreigners, they made up in show; the markings continuously glowed, as if they were 
imbued with some sort of strange magic.</p><p>“Well, what do you think? Impressive isn’t 
it?” Baroach remarked once more to his silent audience.</p><p>The man was unaware of this, 
but the markings alarmed the group more than it did to impress them.</p><p>Ami feigned 
innocent interest in the sight, and asked, “My, this <i>is</i> interesting! I have never 
seen anything like it--would you mind if I took a few pictures?”</p><p>“No, not at all! Go 
right ahead!” <i>Tourists...!</i></p><p>To the inexperienced eye the symbols were 
meaningless. However, given the situation, Mercury could not simply let this go. She took 
out her hand-held computer and initiated her head visor. The screen came alive with target 
symbols and graphs. Unknown to her generous host, while she was taking innocent pictures her 
machine was also following up with systematic scans.</p><p>“Have you ever seen something 
like this before?” Baroach suddenly addressed Makoto. She seemed to have spaced out in her 
own thoughts and was startled by the personal question.</p><p>“Oh. No, I haven’t.” She 
forced a smile. “But you’re right, they are impressive. We don’t have anything like it back 
on Jupiter.”</p><p>“Yeah, I kinda figured.” The man said with an obvious, disappointed 
look.</p><p>Makoto felt her face burn. She knew her people weren’t exactly hailed among the 
smartest of the solar system—but it was still insulting nevertheless.</p><p><i>Why 
you...!</i></p><p>“What about you?” He asked Ami, purposely avoiding Rei. “You’re from 
Mercury, aren’t you? What do you make of it?”</p><p>“Well, I honestly can’t say. As a mere 
representative, my background consists of planet communications and political studies... so, 
regrettably, I am ill-suited for investigative research. However, if you would like to 
inquire more about the subject matter, I would suggest speaking of such matters with our 
ruler when you receive an audience with her.” Ami smiled (only her friends could sense the 
coldness though the sparkles). “But if you absolutely insist on my opinion, then I would 
have to say that it is a pretty sight.”</p><p>“Ha...hahahaha! True! I would have to agree 
with you. You know, you have quite an eye there missy... for a diplomat.” He failed to 
notice Ami placing her hand on Makoto’s arm, silently warning the taller woman to control 
herself. “But maybe this will make it more interesting for you. Those markings that you see 
on the walls are actually spells.”</p><p>“Spells?” Ami raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“That’s 
right! You know, magic, and all that hokus poky sort of stuff. I don’t really understand it 
myself, but a friend of mine once told me that these markings can control the palace 
security... sometimes, even the wind itself!”</p><p>Everyone’s gazes sharpened upon hearing 
this information.</p><p>“It would be really great if that were true…But things don’t seem to 
be that simple.” Baroach said with a saddened tone. “They said that there’s a key needed to 
control it, and only the current ruler of Uranus is in possession of it. If it ever did 
exist, it would have disappeared with Uranus, Haruka.” The party tensed at the mention of 
their friend’s name. “I understand that you may think ill of me and my comrades for 
supporting the former Uranus, but if there’s one thing that I would like you to know, it’s 
that we would have never wanted her to be kidnapped.”</p><p>“Kidnapped?!” Rei exclaimed. She 
bit her tongue before the accusations could even start.</p><p><i>So Haruka was kidnapped? 
</i>Ami and Makoto simultaneously questioned. If the information was true, then perhaps they 
were on the right track. What if both Uranus and Neptune had been abducted?</p><p>“Yes, 
unfortunately... that is correct,” Baroach nodded with a sorrowful look. “Please, come in. I 
will explain it all inside.”</p><p>As they were led into the Great Hall, the guests tried to 
distract their thoughts regarding their comrade’s predicament by willing themselves to 
become completely absorbed in their surroundings. From the moment they passed under the 
great arch into the palace, they were not disappointed. Nothing had changed, even after all 
of these years. There was a bright red carpet that courted the center of the white marble 
halls. To either side of it, there were many extravagant, gold columns that continued to 
support the ancient structure even after so many millennia. While out back, although they 
had yet the chance to see them, there were many open terraces along the palace walls-- the 
wind continually brushed past the curtains as it visited the rooms. It also occasionally 
nuzzled the rare potted plant inside a room.</p><p>The group passed by the rows of portraits 
in the Great Hall. Rei briefly paused to ‘admire’ the one to her right. In it, the painter 
had drawn the adult Uranus and his young heir when Haruka was still very young. They were 
standing side by side. Even back then the child’s bright green eyes possessed a wild sort of 
nature to them.</p><p><i>Haruka was kidnapped...? </i>Rei whispered to herself. It pained 
her to even think of it. The place was already bringing back memories of a visit from long 
ago.</p><p><i><b>Tup! Tup! Tup!</b></i></p><p>“<i>Hey Rei, come look at this!” Haruka 
beckoned the other girl. The blonde was practically jumping to show her friend something. 
“COME ON! You’re so slow! Like… oh, what does Michiru call them? Oh! I remember now,” She 
snapped her fingers. “Like a turtle! Don’t tell me you’ve been slacking off on your 
training.”</i></p><p>“<i>No… not…at all Haruka…” The raven-haired girl growled back between 
breaths. Her right eyebrow was twitching dangerously. She was starting to regret Ares and 
Uranus’s private visits together. “It’s just that…I don’t climb cliff’s everyday like a 
monkey and---hey! There were stairs?!” She exclaimed upon once spotting the 
steps.</i></p><p>“<i>Oh...those?” Haruka tried to look 
innocent.</i></p><p>“<i>Haruka…”</i></p><p><i>But the blonde just laughed at the enraged 
girl. “Okay, okay! Chill! You can kill me later, but first you gotta see this! C’mon look!” 
She pointed at a palace column.</i></p><p>“<i>Huh? What are you talking about--”Rei blinked. 
“Wait, is just me or is that writing glowing?”</i></p><p>“<i>Haha, nope, it’s not you. Did 
you know that people say that Uranus can control the wind with these? I even heard that this 
is why we are able to live in the sky. The pillars hold the islands up. Pretty cool, 
dont’cha think?”</i></p><p>Thinking back to Haruka’s smiling face brought a frown to Rei’s 
own. <i>Kidnapped?</i></p><p>However, as deep as she was in her thoughts, Rei could not 
overlook the soldiers in black suits of armor. They practically littered every corridor in 
at least pairs, like pests. It annoyed her to see them standing there and acting like they 
actually belonged there. The guards remained at their posts in motionless silence, moving 
only to salute as the group passed them. For as many as there were, it was a bloody miracle 
that there wasn’t a single watchdog in the large, spacious room where the group had finally 
come to a halt.</p><p>It was an open place, a smaller version of the Great Hall with 
exception that there were three stairwells that branched down into this area instead of two. 
They all led up to the second floor, with each of them continuing directly into separate 
corridors. Directly beneath the stairways there were also entrances to passageways on the 
lower level that they were now standing on.</p><p>“As you were saying <i>Sir</i> Baroach... 
I do believe you were about to give us an explanation.” Makoto politely reminded 
him.</p><p>“Yes, of course. First of all, there is little doubt in my mind that you have 
suspicions against me for simply being in the palace, isn’t that right? You have all 
probably asked yourselves why a person of the lower lands is here in the land of the 
sky.”</p><p>Rei remained silent. She had no idea where this was going, but it had better be 
good because she, for one, was <i>not</i> in a good mood.</p><p>“As I’ve mentioned before, I 
am no longer a part of the True Wind Clan. Before the unfortunate...disappearance of our 
ruler, I was granted the position of second in command. It was to improve the relations 
between the people of the lower lands and of the people of the sky.” He took a moment to 
pause. “However, even I never saw it coming.”</p><p>“What do you mean? Saw ‘what’ coming?” 
Rei pressed.</p><p>“I shared the position of second in command with a fellow named Soren 
Auranos. He’s a tall, handsome character, with blonde hair green eyes much like our ruler. 
But he was always secretive and calculating. Before I knew it, he had become corrupt, and 
power hungry... or perhaps, he had always been that way and I never noticed until it was too 
late. But even if I had found out sooner, what could I have done to prevent it? After all, I 
am a person from the lower lands--who would have taken my word seriously? In any case, it 
appeared that Soren got greedy and desired more than just his rank. So he planned a mutiny. 
It’s infuriating, but he nearly took it all within a single night! He kidnapped his ruler! 
No one has seen her ever since… And, as you have likely heard, our planet fell into chaos 
shortly afterwards. I cannot attest as to why Neptune’s ruler has also recently gone 
missing, but those are matters that do not concern us.”</p><p>“So, if I understand this 
right...while your leader was missing you thought it would be best if the former leader, the 
person who you used to serve, took her place?” Makoto tentatively asked.</p><p>Baroach 
returned the accusing stare.</p><p>“The people demanded order. So who else was qualified 
enough to take over temporarily but the former Uranus? If he wasn’t so busy attending to 
matters right now, he would be here instead of myself.”</p><p>“If that is true... Then what 
do you expect from us?” Ami questioned.</p><p>“The rebels are still at large. We still don’t 
know where they’ve taken Sir Haruka, but we do know where her sword is. If it is possible, I 
would like to request that you help us to retrieve it.”</p><p>“But why the sword...? What’s 
so special about it?” Minako asked curiously. Baroach tried to ignore her.</p><p>“Answer the 
question.” Rei repeated threateningly, causing the man to flinch.</p><p>“All right, there’s 
no need to shout. Do you recall when we were discussing those markings earlier? Well, we 
have reason to believe that her sword is the key to controlling the palace security. It can 
activate the writings to prevent outside attacks. I suspect that Soren must have somehow 
gotten a hold of the sword shortly before his attack, and that’s why...”</p><p>“...You think 
he was able to catch everyone off guard.” Rei finished.</p><p>“Exactly,” the man nodded. “In 
fact, he’s still probably using it right now. Since the markings have been activated, all of 
our communications have been acting up. That’s probably why you saw the incorrect title 
attached to my transmission. In any case... if we can get a hold of the sword, and our 
communications system returns to normal, then we should be able to locate Sir Haruka. Until 
then, we’re at the mercy of an attack. That’s why palace security is so tight at the moment. 
We just never know when an attack will come.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>“Anyway, I assume you 
ladies must be exhausted from that long and tiring trip. Perhaps it would be best if you all 
rested up before we continued with the meeting?” Baroach suggested.</p><p>“That won’t be 
necessary,” Rei interjected at once (to no one’s surprise). “I would like to meet with 
Uranus as soon as possible. Unlike some of us, there are those who do not have the time to 
waste.”</p><p>Automatically Baroach glanced to the trio behind Rei.</p><p>“Ah, I see. I 
think Sir Uranus will be able to meet with you, but I am afraid our leader will only 
negotiate with the leader of another planet. These representatives… it is unfortunate, but 
they cannot attend the meeting.”</p><p>“What?” Makoto challenged. Her body screamed in pain 
when she suddenly took a step forward. She definitely did not like where this was going.“A 
planet has representatives for a reason Sir Baroach! And for precisely that reason, we are 
here on behalf of our planet leaders. Barring us would be equivalent to barring our 
ruler!”</p><p>But Baroach brushed the comment aside. “Please, I am only following the orders 
of Sir Uranus. I’ve only repeated what I was told. No one other than the planet leaders 
themselves are allowed in his audience.”</p><p>“Yes Ms. Jupiter, please remember that he is 
only doing his duty.”</p><p>Makoto was shocked that that Ami had just agreed with this man 
and, the way the woman had addressed her! Jupiter could only stare as she watched those pair 
of blue eyes met hers, urging her hold her tongue as she heard Ami’s thoughts answer 
her.</p><p><i>Try to stay calm Makoto; if you allow yourself to become too upset, you won’t 
be able to suppress your aura. It must be hard enough as it is in your condition. If that 
happens--</i></p><p><i>I’m fine! </i></p><p>Yet for a moment Makoto’s eyes glowed with her 
aura before quickly submerging under a mask of calm. Why did it feel like Ami was trying to 
distance herself from her? Why couldn’t she stop feeling as though something between them 
changed since the incident on Jupiter?</p><p><i>What you’re trying to say is that we can’t 
blow our cover right? I get that. Don’t worry, I won’t let that 
happen.</i></p><p><i>Makoto...</i></p><p>The green-eyed woman turned her head away and broke 
their contact. She just couldn’t bear to tell Ami that she was right, that she was having 
trouble controlling her aura. Back in the infirmary, she had told Rei a white lie. Not all 
of her wounds had been healed. In fact, she still felt somewhat weak and sick. The trek 
through the city, and then climbing that stupid cliff had left her feeling 
exhausted.</p><p><i>My powers... Sometimes, I can feel it starting to seep out… </i>Her 
hands slightly trembled. She went through great pains to avoid showing pain or worry in her 
movements. <i>But I know I can do this! I just got to stay calm. Just don’t think about 
</i><i><b>that</b></i><i>, </i>she told herself. She returned her attention to the 
conversation.</p><p>“Well, I glad that someone understands!” Baroach beamed at the Martian. 
“But there is no need to worry representative of Jupiter! There’s no reason that we cannot 
inform you of the on-goings during the meeting per say and there’s little doubt that you may 
join in once the documents require signature. I hope that you would agree with me that this 
isn’t unreasonable. It shouldn’t take very long at all.”</p><p>“But still…” Jupiter wanted 
to protest.</p><p>…<b>ping…</b></p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>“Rei? I-I mean, Sir?” Minako tried to 
lightly squeeze the woman’s hand, but found that she was already holding it very 
tightly.</p><p>“These arrangements are fine. All of us do not need to be present to talk to 
one man.” Rei turned her head and met Makoto’s eyes.</p><p><i>I’ll be all right. Don’t 
forget that our troops are occupying the city as we speak.<br></i><br>Makoto felt numb, but 
inside Rei’s words still hit her. The Martian warrior, being unaware of Makoto’s 
predicament, then simply continued on as if nothing had happened.<br><i><br></i>“Besides, it 
may be better that you diplomats get some rest. It has been an exhausting day and we 
wouldn’t want a planet’s representative’s health become poor from over-exhaustion… right, 
Ms. Jupiter?”</p><p>“And me?” Minako finally asked. Although she already had an inkling of 
what the answer would be, she still hoped she could stay with Rei.</p><p>“I’m sorry... 
however close you two may be I still cannot allow anyone other than a planet ruler to be 
present.” Baroach started. “You understand, don’t you Sir Mars?”</p><p>Rei inwardly flinched 
upon hearing the title. <i>Yes, I actually DO mind!</i> She wanted to yell. The thought of 
leaving Minako here by herself made her stomach knot uneasily. She didn’t entirely buy the 
man’s story. There was just too much left unanswered. And although it was true that the 
blonde woman would most likely be safe under Makoto and Ami’s care, and it wasn’t that she 
couldn’t trust her friends, she somehow couldn’t become comfortable with the idea of letting 
the golden-haired woman out of her sight.</p><p><i>Minako’s a klutz, she runs into things, 
and… she doesn’t know—well anything about other planets! Hell, when she first came to Mars 
she couldn’t even figure out how to turn on a bath! </i>She may have actually smirked at the 
memory if it weren’t for the circumstances.</p><p>However, the more logical side of her 
compelled her to instead say,</p><p>“Yes, I heard you the first time. However, what will 
become of my maid?”</p><p>“Oh, she may join the palace staff. People of her position may 
wish to become acquainted with others of her rank—is that not acceptable? But I guarantee 
you that there is no need to worry! Both you and your servant will be re-united before 
either of you know it.” Baroach’s eyes gleamed as the words left his mouth. “If that is 
acceptable with you, then please, follow me. I will show you to Sir Uranus.”</p><p>“I see.” 
Rei pretended that she was thinking it over.</p><p><b>Ping!</b></p><p><i>Huh?! 
</i></p><p>Her senses were suddenly on the alert. It was that same ‘watchful’ feeling from 
earlier.</p><p><i>There it is again! Where is it coming from...? </i>The warrior’s amethyst 
eyes darted to the right-hand corner of the room, into the shadows, where she threw a 
portion of her power and searched for the elusive presence. Yet it disappeared so quickly 
that Rei had begun to seriously wonder if it was merely a miss-detection.</p><p><i>There’s 
something off about this place… </i>But where she was headed she was going alone into 
unknown territory. She was reluctant, but she was now convinced that Minako would definitely 
be safer with Ami and Makoto. They were Goddesses after all.</p><p>“Girl, you are to join 
the palace staff. Take this as a break from your duties to me if you will. Enjoy it while it 
lasts.”</p><p><i>Rei…</i> Minako’s hands shook slightly, feeling unable to let go. But the 
expression in the woman’s dark eyes was paralyzing her. The words of protest just wouldn’t 
leave her lips. <i>Don’t go with him! I’ve got a bad feeling about this!</i></p><p>“Your 
Majesty, are we ready yet?” Baroach beckoned again.</p><p>“Yes. I am ready,” Rei remarked as 
she pried off Minako’s hand. “Show me this leader.” She said as she turned and faced the 
man.</p><p>“Yes… as you wish.” He bowed and then gave one last word of instruction to the 
remaining trio. “The palace servants shall be here shortly to guide you to your 
destinations. I bid thee farewell for now.”</p><p>Baroach and Rei then left. Minako felt the 
voice inside of her die down altogether as she watched the Martian depart down the center 
path of the three. As the man had promised, it wasn’t long before a pair of palace servants 
met with the group. One man bowed and offered to escort Ami and Makoto to their rooms via 
the right path, while the woman of the pair took Minako’s hand and led her down the left 
path towards the servant’s quarters.</p><p><u>(Diplomat Quarters)</u></p><p>Makoto and Ami 
both waited patiently until the servant had taken his leave. The man said his part in 
‘welcoming’ the guests, reminding them to call for him if they should ever require 
assistance, before he excused himself. As soon as he left the room and closed the door 
behind himself, the two Goddesses performed a detection search.</p><p>With Makoto on one 
side of the room and Ami on the other, their eyes became distant as their powers were slowly 
allowed to flood throughout the chamber’s perimeters. Makoto couldn’t stress how relieved 
she felt when she could finally release the restrictions on her power, even if it was only a 
small portion. The green energy eagerly lapped at the floor, flying up along the surrounding 
walls and coated the ceiling with urgency. It overtook everything that happened to get in 
its way. Before she realized it, her powers had even started to overlap with Ami’s. The 
woman gasped and immediately tried to reel it in before it got out of hand.</p><p><i>Hang in 
there… </i>Makoto commanded herself. She involuntarily shivered. For some reason, ever since 
they had split up from the main group she felt cold. She sincerely hoped that she wasn’t 
coming down sick.</p><p>Perspiration began to form on her brow as she furrowed her eyebrows 
into deeper concentration. When her aura finally found what she was looking for, Makoto drew 
her power back into her fold. Each spark of green energy that retreated into her set her 
body ablaze over and over again. It caused her wounds to burn, but she refused to cry out. 
She pushed herself to keep going. Only once had it all retreated, did the tall woman stagger 
over to a nearby desk (she was thankful that Ami was too deep in concentration to notice her 
awkward condition). There, underneath the piece of furniture she found a hidden 
camera.</p><p><i>Huh. There you are…</i> She was about to reach out and disconnect the 
device when Ami’s aura suddenly surged up. A series of crackling noises shot from one end of 
the room to the other, like fire crackers, followed by the fading light of dying metal. Only 
until the noises stopped did the blue aura withdraw obediently back to its 
owner.</p><p><i>What did she---?</i> Makoto quizzically blinked back at her companion, 
wondering what all that was about. However she didn’t have to look very far to find her 
answer; the video camera under the desk was practically smoking. Ami had short circuited 
it!</p><p><i>Woah! She probably got all of them then. Haha, leave it to Ami… </i></p><p>The 
cold inside was growing.</p><p><b>…</b><b>ping…</b></p><p>“You sure know how to handle these 
things huh?” Makoto gave a weak grin, but Ami diverted her gaze as her eyes were quickly 
losing their empty, distant appearance. Why wouldn’t she look at her?</p><p>“It was the most 
efficient way of handling it, yes.” Mercury bashfully admitted. “Though... I suppose this 
shouldn’t come as a surprise to us. Haruka would never have such devices hidden in her 
guest’s chambers, but obviously, that does not mean our current hosts would abide to such 
honourable actions.”</p><p>Jupiter shrugged, again feeling the stab of anger swell within 
her. “No, I guess not. But that makes me even more worried.” She attempted to change the 
subject.</p><p>“About Rei?”</p><p>“...About everything! I just can’t believe that the civil 
war has already started! And Baroach…I don’t trust him at all. His story sounds fishy to me. 
I mean, Haruka would never let herself get kidnapped and it still doesn’t provide an 
explanation for Michiru’s disappearance either.”</p><p>The woman walked over to the nearby 
wall and leaned her forearms against it.</p><p><i>Damn, it’s getting really cold now. Is it 
just me? It doesn’t look like Ami feels it too.</i></p><p>“I’m sure Rei has noticed it as 
well.”</p><p><i>Yeah, because she always does!</i> The sarcastic mark sprung up in her 
mind.</p><p>“I know she did. She knew, but she still walked off without us. There’s gotta be 
a better plan.”</p><p>“Such as...?”</p><p>“I don’t know! Something, just something… There 
must be a better way than splitting up like this!”</p><p>What was she feeling now? 
Desperation?</p><p><i>There must be something that I can do! I should be able to think of 
something! C’mon Makoto, think! </i></p><p>The woman wracked her brains for a solution. She 
tried with all of her might but when no strategic miracle came to mind all she could do was 
vent her frustration; she attacked the nearby wall with her 
fist.</p><p><b>Bam!</b></p><p>Makoto’s mind was so clouded now that she never noticed that 
her control was beginning to slip. She barely realized that the darkness was closing 
in.</p><p>“Argh! Damn it Rei!” <i>You’re going to get yourself killed!</i></p><p>“She did 
what she thought was best. What else could we have—Makoto?” Ami stood up and went rigid. Her 
aura was flaring up.</p><p><b>Lubb dubb!</b></p><p>Suddenly Makoto’s head throbbed and her 
pupils contracted. <i>What…?</i> Something inside, which had been stomped on and twisted up 
so tightly for so long, was now beginning to unravel. She could not hear the sinister 
laughter echoing in the distance.</p><p>“<i>Young Majesty, I regret to inform you this but 
your father, the King is…”</i></p><p>“<i>Ami! Snap out of it!” </i>Ami’s dark, clouded eyes 
flashed through her mind.</p><p>“<i>Yeah, I kinda figured.” </i>Baroach’s mocking 
face...</p><p>“<i>Yes Ms. Jupiter, please remember that he is only doing his 
duty.”</i></p><p>“<i>Well, I glad that someone understands!”</i></p><p>A voice that sounded 
eerily similarly to hers emerged from the darkness.</p><p><i>Why is everyone fighting 
against me? I’m not the enemy. I’m only trying to help!</i></p><p>“<i>It has been an 
exhausting day and we wouldn’t want a planet’s representative’s health become poor from 
over-exhaustion… right, Ms. Jupiter?” </i></p><p><i>Do they really think that I’m weak...? 
Am I really just being a burden to everyone?</i></p><p>“No! S-Stop it!”</p><p><i>Get out of 
my head!</i></p><p><b>LUBB DUBB!</b></p><p>Ami appeared visibly shaken by Makoto’s vocal 
outburst. The tall ruler lunged out at an invisible entity, only to successfully trip over a 
chair and falling face-first to the floor. She then rolled, stumbling up briefly, and 
anchored herself against the nearest wall, holding her hand to her head as if she was in 
excruciating pain. Her eyes were shut tight and her ragged breaths were now forced; 
perspiration freely fell from her face as her powers approached dangerous levels. Ami 
noticed Makoto hugging her arms, and watched in horror as the normally collected woman began 
to tear at the bandages around the markings with her bare hands.</p><p>“Makoto?! W-What’s 
wrong? Is it your wounds?! Are they hurting?” Ami reached out with a shaky hand towards her 
friend, but a bolt of Makoto’s green aura lashed out and burned her.</p><p>“Stay 
away!”</p><p><i><b>Crackle!</b></i></p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Although it had been her hand that had 
been hit, the wound cut far deeper than that.</p><p><i>She’s losing control! </i>Ami 
realized, and quickly sent out her own aura. Her power split into two concentrated strands. 
The slim minority went towards sealing off the room, while the majority focused on 
suppressing Makoto’s. Inevitably both powers 
clashed.</p><p><b>CRACKLE!</b></p><p><b>FssssSSSSsssSSSSsssssssSSSSsssssss…</b></p><p>“Makoto, 
try to calm down!” She cried out.</p><p>“Why?” The other woman replied in a strange voice. 
Vaguely, she felt Ami’s aura surrounding her. It was fighting her. She knew she was 
trembling, but why? A part of herself asked,</p><p><i>What am I doing?</i></p><p>She was 
suddenly aware of her arms once again.</p><p>Ami was helpless as she watched Makoto’s own 
aura whirl back and attacked herself. Makoto screamed out in pain. When the bandages 
couldn’t handle the intrusive abuse any longer, they were swept away to reveal that her arms 
were all healed.</p><p>“Ami…I’m really useless aren’t I…?”</p><p><i>There’s something really 
wrong with me.</i></p><p>“Useless? That isn’t--” She found Makoto’s gaze and gasped. 
Jupiter’s green eyes were alternating from their bright, glowing green to black! The moment 
they became black, Makoto’s aura would once again blaze to new 
levels.</p><p>“AHH-------rRRRRRRGH!”</p><p>It was enough to shock Ami out of her horror and 
force herself to double her own efforts. Her blue eyes swirled in determination as a distant 
voice reached her ears.</p><p>“<i>Ami, if there is one thing that you should always 
remember… it’s to never allow things to upset you,” She recalled her father telling 
her.</i></p><p><i>The blue-haired child in her memory looked up quizzically as the elder 
Mercury bent down and looked her in the face.</i></p><p>“<i>When a God or Goddess loses 
control of their emotions, they also lose control over their power. That power could 
potentially destroy everything around them, and even hurt those that the user cherishes. 
That is why you must study hard, and become mentally strong. Never lose control.” As he 
stood to leave, she remembered him whispering, “You are unfortunate that you a true royal my 
daughter…”</i></p><p><i><b>Woosh!</b></i></p><p>Ami flinched as a blast of wind hit 
her.</p><p>“I always have to ask for help. It’s like I can’t do anything on my own… The 
people at the palace, the kind people who serve me… They keep on giving but I couldn’t give 
anything back! I thought that once I became the ruler, things would change, but… but they 
didn’t. They didn’t change at all!”</p><p><i>Makoto…</i> Ami desperately wanted to say 
something, but she had a feeling this wasn’t an ordinary 
occurrence.</p><p><b>Ping!</b></p><p><i>Ah! There’s something else here!</i></p><p>From 
outside the room, she felt something viciously attacking her barrier. In her right state of 
mind, it was a comparatively weak-- like an animal who could only scratch but not bite. Why 
didn’t she sense it earlier?</p><p>“I couldn’t handle the situation on my planet by myself. 
I had to bother both you and Rei, and look what almost happened!”</p><p><i>You both could 
have died because of me…</i> The guilt was breaking through her mental barrier. It wasn’t 
okay! She wasn’t okay!</p><p>“And now…why can’t I think of a plan when we need one? Why do I 
always have to rely on you and Rei?! It’s not that I don’t understand the situation… I-I 
do!” Makoto’s voice finally broke. Tears were beginning to form in her eyes. “Ami, I’m…not 
stupid… I just…I… just…worry…” She pleaded, but her body had already begun to sink into a 
fighting stance.</p><p>“I believe you.”</p><p>It was as if a switch had gone off. Ami’s aura 
exploded out and ripped through the presence outside.</p><p><i>Be gone!</i> She commanded 
it. The dark presence outside screeched as it was engulfed by a bolt of blue light. It 
struggled, but wisely chose to give up the fight and instantly vanished.</p><p>With that 
taken care of, Mercury turned all of her attention to her companion. Sensing that Makoto was 
too unstable to pull her power back on her own, Ami immediately sent her power to surround 
the other woman and encased her within in spherical shaped container. As the sphere 
decreased in volume, it crushed down any remaining green strands that stubbornly leaked out. 
A few seconds passed, and then a minute-- at the end of the line, the green aura trapped 
within it pulsed once or twice more before both auras finally died down into Makoto, leaving 
both women thoroughly exhausted.</p><p><b>FSSSSSssssssssss….</b></p><p>Makoto stood there 
for a moment, with a dazed expression playing on her face, before, finally, her knees 
buckled underneath her. She was barely aware that a pair of arms had grabbed her, until she 
was pulled into a tight embrace.</p><p><i>How long have you been keeping this to 
yourself?</i></p><p>“I’m so sorry Makoto… I should have realized it sooner…” Makoto felt a 
tear fall onto her face and knew that Ami was crying. “You’re not useless. Silly, don’t you 
remember? Ever since we were kids, you were always the strong one. I used to cry a lot... 
and other people would used to talk behind my back, but you never gave up on me. You stayed 
by my side, and always cheered me up when I was down. I’m really glad that I was able to 
meet you.” She felt Makoto’s tense body suddenly relax. “As for your people, you know that’s 
not true. You’ve given them so much! Do you remember that elderly man we met when we visited 
your home? You didn’t have to give him anything, but you still did. They all follow you 
because you care about them.”</p><p>“Hey... Can I, ask you a question?”</p><p>“Yes, of 
course.”</p><p>“Maybe it’s just me... But it’s been on my mind for awhile now. Ever since we 
left Jupiter, it felt like you were being distant with me. Did I do something to make you 
mad?”</p><p>The blue-haired woman looked positively shocked.</p><p>“No! That’s... It’s not 
your fault at all...” she quietly admitted. “It’s just... well... I was a little scared. Not 
of you, but...of myself.” She thought back to the incident on Jupiter. “When we were on 
Jupiter I-I totally lost control of myself. I hurt you. I nearly killed you! I just didn’t 
know what was going on with me, and I felt so horribly ashamed...”</p><p><i>Oh, I see now. 
</i>Makoto silently thought. <i>She was worried about me...</i></p><p>Makoto closed her eyes 
and felt again for her power. This time when she touched it, it didn’t recoil or lash out. 
Rather, it felt warm and tame. Her body briefly emitted a soft, green glow as the restraints 
were re-established and gave them both a peace of mind.</p><p>“I’m so sorry 
Makoto...”</p><p>“No, it’s okay. I should be the one apologizing. I didn’t mean to make you 
worry.” Her own arms came up and wrapped themselves around Ami’s smaller frame.</p><p>Before 
either woman knew it, they were both crying.</p><p><b>Shff, shff…</b></p><p>On the other 
side of the walls of a nearby room, a strange creature twitched violently from the earlier 
attack. It glared venomously at the pair with its red eyes, but began to sniff the air 
irritably when it realized that it was being stalked. Swinging its tiny head around, it 
snarled at the invisible force that dared to disturb it but the other force either failed to 
notice or dismissed its wishes entirely. Instead a windy hand shot down and made to grab the 
creature, only to narrowly miss it and see it disappear into the shadows of the 
room.</p><p>There was a contemplative silence until the presence decided to give chase after 
the intruder. It too, then disappeared from the room.</p><p><u>(Minako, En route to 
Servant’s Quarters)</u></p><p>While Makoto and Ami had been led away to the Diplomat’s 
quarters, Minako had been guided down a different set of halls and down a narrow staircase 
that led towards the kitchen. The young woman guiding her took her past many of the 
underground work rooms where people of their ‘rank’ worked and performed their daily duties. 
But it hardly fazed the despondent Venusian. Witnessing all these men and women pushing 
themselves so hard had indeed formed a cloud of doubt over her head, but the idea of manual 
labor could not stay in her thoughts long before worries for her Martian friend took the 
center stage.</p><p><i>It feels wrong to be separated.</i> Minako peered down at the hand 
that had held Rei’s only moments before. The warmth of their touch still lingered. <i>I hope 
she’s all right…</i></p><p>“Are you worried?” The servant asked her.</p><p>“Huh? Oh. Maybe a 
little...” Minako shrugged, once realizing she was being talked to. She never really took 
much notice of her guide until now. She appeared to be about her age, perhaps a year or two 
older she supposed. They were about the same height as well. But the other woman’s hair was 
a lighter shade of blonde than Minako’s own-- it was held up in a high ponytail-- and she 
had light green eyes and wore a bright red bandana around her neck. There were subtle facial 
differences, but otherwise Minako could have sworn that they almost looked 
identical.</p><p>“Hey, chin up girl! There’s nothing to be ashamed about; you weren’t the 
only one who got caught. I mean, there’s a whole bunch of us who did. But what were you 
doing hanging out with those officials? Did Kali make you spy on them or something? I’ve got 
to admit, that was a pretty gutsy move… But don’t tell her that I told you that or she’ll 
get on my case.”</p><p>“…?” <i>Eh? W-Wait... Is she talking about me?! Spy? I don’t spy on 
people! Who is she? Who’s Kali?</i></p><p>However what the woman said next <i>really</i> 
caught Minako’s attention.</p><p>“No need to worry though! Soren’s got a plan going. You’ve 
got great timing too! He just called a meeting. I think we’re finally going to make our 
move!”</p><p><i>Soren? Oh my Goddess! It’s them! </i>“B-But I’m not…” She began to 
panic.</p><p>“Aha! Here we are.” The servant stopped them before a wooden door. She promptly 
turned to face Minako and offered out her hand. “By the way, I don’t think we’ve met before. 
My name is Celeste.” Minako hesitantly shook hands with the other woman. When Minako didn’t 
offer her own name, Celeste seemed to take no offence; instead she flashed a sisterly smile. 
“Still got the nervous stomach butterflies, huh? Well don’t worry. Remember, behind this 
door we’re all friends.”</p><p><b>Creeeeeak...</b></p><p>Celeste shooed Minako in, giving 
the uneasy blonde a gentle push into the crowded room. As the guide had described, there 
were many, many people packed in the place. They all had blonde hair and light coloured 
eyes, not excluding the man in center of the masses. Amongst the crowd stood a broad 
shouldered man, who possessed short blonde hair and green eyes like Celeste. Although unlike 
the woman, he looked to be in his late twenties and was also sparsely covered with 
armor—there were a few arm and leg guards atop of his garments, but nothing as extravagant 
as a full suit. The particularly long, sheathed sword that he carried on his back 
particularly drew attention.</p><p>All eyes turned as soon as the door had opened. Minako 
was stunned by the intense attention she received. She especially felt uneasy when the man 
she assumed to be their leader cast his gaze on her as well.</p><p><i>That must be him.</i> 
<i>Soren… And on his back, is that the sword that Baroach was talking 
about?</i></p><p>“Celeste, you’re late.” The man automatically answered. “Hm?”</p><p>“Sorry 
about that Soren, but I got a call from our ‘master’,” She made a gagging action, promptly 
earning a laugh from the rest of her comrades. “But check out who I brought! She was being 
assigned to maid duty.”</p><p>Minako glanced around nervously at all the faces. The way 
everyone was staring at her made her wish she could crawl into a corner, or under a rock, 
anywhere that would make her invisible to the probing stares. There were just too many 
strange faces at once.</p><p>With Baroach’s tale in mind, all Minako could do was stand 
rigid and listen to the voices all around her.</p><p>“Blonde hair, blue eyes… looks like one 
of us to me.”</p><p>“Think she got caught?”</p><p>“Probably. She’s just a child though... 
They wouldn’t send her to prison.”</p><p>“Is making her a servant like us any better? I’d 
rather have died first.”</p><p>“Quiet! Why don’t we let Soren deal with it?”Someone 
suggested.</p><p>“Yes, let Soren…”</p><p>The man named Soren, like the rest of his comrades, 
was also staring at Minako. He was curious about her but not for the same reasons as the 
others. Though he remained silent, his sharp green eyes flashed every so often as thoughts 
and possibilities raced through his head. He finally walked up to her and bent down to study 
her face.</p><p>“Let’s see… blonde hair, blue eyes… hmm...yeah, you’re definitely not one of 
them. All of Baroach’s henchmen have dark hair. You’re all right 
kid.”</p><p>“I--Ah...”</p><p>“What the matter? Cat got your tongue?”</p><p>“She doesn’t talk 
much Soren,” Celeste piped up. “Either she’s in shock still from being caught, or she might 
be a new recruit, or maybe…”</p><p>Minako 
gulped.</p><p>“Both.”</p><p><i>Whew.</i></p><p>“Hmmm... A new recruit, huh? Well listen up, 
there’s no need to be afraid of us! We all botch up once in awhile, so no one is going to 
look down on you for it. It takes courage to overcome your fears. When we feel alone, 
betrayed, or cornered, fear is what clouds our hearts and attempts to lead us astray from an 
honourable way of life! It leads to betrayal, distrust and defeat. If you give it your all, 
and take that first step forward for others, then they will do the same for you. This is our 
way! This is Uranus’s way!” Soren gestured, and the crowd cheered in agreement.</p><p>As the 
man spoke, Minako felt her stomach doing flip-flops. There was something odd about his 
speech. In fact, there was something dreadfully wrong about this entire scenario. Were these 
people really the bad guys?</p><p>“What’s your name?” Soren finally 
inquired.</p><p>“M-Minako.” There was a slight pause.</p><p><i>Ever since I left home, I 
promised myself that I wouldn’t be a coward. I couldn’t do anything for Ami or Makoto back 
on Jupiter, and I couldn’t do anything when I tried using detection for the first time. I’m 
sorry everyone, but I...</i></p><p>“Nice, so you can talk! Always good to know. So then 
Minako--”</p><p>“Please wait. I’m not done.”</p><p><i>...I want to be a little braver... 
</i></p><p>Minako held her hands to her chest, and lowered her head. No one could clearly 
see the diplomat’s facial expression as the combination of the dim room and her bangs 
shadowed her eyes, but they sure wished they could. All around her many of the soldiers were 
questioning what this woman was doing. A few of them even thought it was rude that the 
Venusian had interrupted their leader. Anyone of their rank was expected to be silent when 
being talked to by a superior. Would Soren punish her?</p><p>Soren on the other hand carried 
an expectant grin. To his subordinates’ surprise, there was no displeasure evident anywhere 
in his eyes or stance.</p><p>“I apologize. Please, continue…” He encouraged.</p><p>Minako 
lifted her head high and looked him straight in the eye. A strange connection was then made, 
and she understood.</p><p><i>Goddess... He knows…!</i></p><p>“My name… is Venus Minako. And 
I am a diplomat from Venus!”</p><p>This time there was a series of gasps from the crowd. It 
definitely was not what they had expected. What was the diplomat of a neutral planet doing 
out here of all places? Especially one from Venus?</p><p>“I see.” Soren remarked with little 
surprise. Indeed he had suspected something, but this was better than what he had expected. 
“Celeste, as third in command, you absolutely need to work on your wind readings.”</p><p>But 
the other woman was too busy gawking to actually listen. When her superior called to her 
again, all she could do was nod dumbly.</p><p>“You knew from the start.” Minako commented in 
a serious tone. Her blue eyes had lost all nervousness, and had hardened into something more 
confident.</p><p>“It was your aura that gave you away. I could hear it. People with stronger 
powers naturally distort the air around them.”</p><p>Minako felt her eyes widen a little as 
she heard this. <i>My aura…?</i> She had never noticed it until Soren had mentioned it. But 
now that she thought about it, it did feel like there was a warm blanket of air around her. 
There was no color to it, but there was definitely something there.</p><p>“If you had 
suppressed it, I wouldn’t have noticed anything different about you from the rest of us. 
Were you trying to test me?”</p><p><i>He thinks I was trying to test him? Maybe this could 
work after all.</i> The swell of air around Minako suddenly died down, leaving her skin 
tingling and somewhat cold. Yet it had left behind a new found courage.</p><p>“Before I 
answer that, may I please inquire who you are?” There was a great confusion playing out in 
Minako’s mind. The way Baroach had described this man and the way she saw him thus far-- it 
was almost as if they had been speaking about two, completely different 
people.</p><p>“...Certainly. My apologies for not properly introducing myself earlier... 
After all, disrespecting a diplomat is equivalent to disrespecting their planet ruler,” He 
gave a slight bow, once again inspiring awe from his people at the majestic scene. Although 
their leader was not adorned in Uranus’s proud suit of armor, they were still impressed. 
Even if some weren’t, Minako for one knew that she was (especially considering her earlier 
run in with Baroach). So far, she was feeling more inclined to take Soren’s word over the 
former.</p><p>“My name is Soren Auranos. I am second in command to our planet ruler, Uranus 
Haruka. The young lady who escorted you here is our third in command, Celeste Daytem. She 
shares the position with my younger sister, Kali Auranos. And as you may have already 
noticed Lady Venus, this is no ordinary gathering of palace servants.” The men and women 
around him cheered. “Now, if you don’t mind... may we know the reason why a diplomat such as 
yourself has come all this way to Uranus? Surely it is not to sully your hands with our 
affairs as your planet is classified with neutral status.”</p><p>Minako took a deep breath. 
Yes, she supposed she was obligated to return the favour.</p><p>“Normally that is the 
case…but at this moment I am acting as an observer with the Inner Alliance. Jupiter has 
recently joined their cause.” She paused thoughtfully.</p><p><i>There’s something odd about 
this. Call it a gut feeling, but why do I get the feeling that I’m missing something? From 
the story that Baroach told us, he described Soren as a corrupt and power hungry animal, but 
Soren’s mannerisms and skills are exceptional, and easily overtake Baroach’s… That other man 
was clueless about my identity, and dismissed Makoto and Ami with a superiority complex! All 
he cared about was Rei. </i>The goal of their mission came floating back to mind. <i>All we 
came here to do was negotiate, but none of us suspected that a war had already broken out! 
We want minimum bloodshed, and control… I understand that. But I truly believe that Rei 
would never strike a deal with a corrupt man, even if it were the easiest way to conquer a 
planet. If only she were here…</i></p><p>“Would you consider joining the Inner 
Alliance?”</p><p>“Join the Inner Alliance?” Soren exclaimed in astonishment. “Why would you 
ask us? I thought the Martian ruler had already gone to ask Baroach.”</p><p>“She is not a 
fool!” Minako firmly stressed. “Though I do not know her immediate plan of action, I have 
confidence that she will not impulsively sign a suspicious agreement. Mr. Baroach has told 
her his side of the story, but since she is not here, let me hear yours in her 
place!”</p><p>There was a mutter throughout the room. Soren raised his hand, and ordered for 
silence.</p><p>“Yes, I’ve heard what he has told you about us. He said that we betrayed Sir 
Haruka, and planned a mutiny and kidnapped her. He told you that we were the ones who 
wronged our leader.” Soren’s green eyes flashed. The mere indignant thought had also set the 
room ablaze with rekindled battle-fire. Minako could sense the restlessness in the 
atmosphere. “And you’re saying that you would trust us?”</p><p>Minako met his eyes again. “I 
am saying that I will hear you out. Please let me hear your side of the story.”</p><p>She 
was secretly relieved to see that seething anger in the man’s eyes die down.</p><p>“All 
right…” Soren drew a sword from his waist and showed it to her. “If you must know, it all 
started because of this.”</p><p>“Because of that sword...?”</p><p>Minako wasn’t blind to see 
that there was nothing common about this metal; it greatly reminded her of the sword Rei 
carried around. However, unlike the Martian sword, Uranus’s sword possessed two strips of 
solid gold that narrowed down the center of the blade from the T-shaped hilt. Along the two 
gold pieces was another, thinner piece of green that outlined the gold, and between these 
lines there were golden symbols engraved into the metal.</p><p><i>Wait--those 
markings...!</i></p><p>Minako instantly recognized them- -she had seen them glowing on the 
pillars outside of the palace entrance.<i><br></i><br>“Yes. As you probably already know, 
whoever holds this blade can activate the spells on the palace entrance and seal the 
building off from outside forces. Once it’s seal, nothing can get in and nothing can get 
out.” He held it upright with its tip lightly balanced on the floor, allowing the light 
above to shine upon it and gave his comrades a good look at their coveted 
treasure.</p><p><i>So I was right! This is the sword Baroach was talking about! </i>Minako 
realized.</p><p>“Regardless of what Baroach had told you we did not kidnap Sir 
Haruka.”</p><p><i>What?!</i></p><p>“Please pardon me if this sounds rude, but… if this Sir 
Haruka wasn’t kidnapped then does this mean that you don’t know of your ruler’s 
whereabouts...at all?”</p><p>“That is correct. Unfortunately, one day she just disappeared. 
Without any word or warning, she was gone.”</p><p>“I see.” <i>So much for the kidnapping 
theory. </i>“Please, continue… What happened, as you were saying?”</p><p>“It started long 
before our ruler’s disappearance. One day, he approached the palace asking for a chance to 
redeem himself and his people. Baroach grovelled on the floor, begging Sir Haruka for a way 
to improve relations between us and our former folk. Needless to say, his wish was granted, 
and he took an oath. He swore his loyalty!”</p><p>Minako flinched upon hearing the 
bitterness in his voice.</p><p>“Our leader was more than gracious enough to allow him to 
share the position of commander with me. At first I dismissed my suspicions for foolish 
jealously, and forced myself to work alongside with him. But it then became one thing after 
another, and my suspicions grew. Over time, we allowed his people to move back from the 
lower lands to our city. We watched them as they took up residence and mingle with our 
citizens. They all looked happy, and everything seemed to be going very well. But 
then…Shortly after that, out of the blue, Baroach began to inquire about the spells at the 
palace entrance.”</p><p>“<i>Say, I’ve always been meaning to ask you this Soren, but what’s 
with those funny markings on these walls?”</i></p><p>“<i>...”</i></p><p>“<i>Ah. Oh, c’mon! 
After all we’ve been through, you still don’t trust me? I thought we were 
friends.”</i></p><p>“Hah… and that’s how he came to know about Uranus’s sword. It’s kept in 
the palace vault when our leader was not in battle.” Soren trained his eyes on the shining 
blade. In his mind he could see the images playing across its reflective surface. “I must 
admit... That was a mistake on my part.”</p><p><i>The ambush came immediately after Sir 
Haruka’s disappearance. In the middle of the night, there was uproar in the city of Caelus. 
The air rang with screams and pleas for help! I was on guard that night. When I heard the 
noise I ran to look from a city-facing balcony, and what I saw were the people of the lower 
lands--they had taken up their swords and began to purge the city! Before my very eyes, our 
people were being forced into chains! Those who resisted were killed on the 
spot.</i></p><p><i>I ran with everything I had to the vault. I had to get there before 
Baroach did. By the time I arrived I instantly spotted the traitorous scum scouring the 
place himself. I will never forget that look of surprise, and hatred, when I stole the sword 
right out of his very grasp.</i></p><p>“That was all I was able to retrieve though. I 
couldn’t take back the city... I could not set my people free from their chains, nor could I 
completely keep the palace from his control. But with those who’ve managed to flee, we 
re-grouped and formed what you see now. The people here have either infiltrated with me, or 
were caught and forced to become servants. Everyone who is apparently not of ‘his kind’, are 
either fit for servant duty or are left to rot in the dungeons.”</p><p>“I see.” Minako 
replied, letting the man know that he still had her full attention.</p><p>“When we heard 
that the Inner Alliance was approaching we considered making contact. However, Baroach, as 
you probably now know, had taken full control over our communication’s system. He keeps it 
heavily guarded.”</p><p>“So you thought for the worst and prepared your forces for battle. 
You wished to go out fighting.”</p><p>“Yes. After all, I took an oath and swore to guard my 
home and this sword to my last dying breath! But as things are now… it would be far easier 
for the Inner Alliance to join with Baroach. I fear he may resort to using the other 
diplomats as ransom if the Martian leader is uncooperative. I doubt that even she is 
completely invincible to treachery... There is a chance that you may end up fighting us in 
the end.”</p><p>Minako closed her eyes for a moment, carefully taking it all in. Yes, she 
supposed it all made sense now--certainty much more than the story of the ruler’s people 
planning a mutiny. It was clear that Soren’s group was still loyal to their leader, and her 
heart went out to them. However, Soren had made a valid point. All four of them, Ami, 
Makoto, Rei and herself, they were all still within Baroach’s sphere of influence. It was 
difficult to assess whether their troops would be able to arrive in time if a fight did 
break out. After all, they were far away from the city where the majority of their soldiers 
were now likely stationed. It placed them all within a precarious situation.</p><p><i>If 
something were to happen to my friends, I don’t know what I’d do. Rei... She’s in there all 
alone. And Ami and Makoto... there were so many soldiers in the halls! Even if they’re 
Goddesses, would they be able to fight them all off by themselves? </i></p><p>In her heart, 
Minako knew that there was no way she could save all of her friends on her own. She would 
need help.</p><p>“That is true,” Minako said slowly.</p><p>Everyone secretly held their 
breaths.</p><p>“However... After hearing your side of the story, and having met both 
parties, I would still like to extend this offer to you. Please join the Inner 
Alliance!”</p><p>It was more than Soren’s people could have hoped for. But the offer was too 
wonderful, how could no one have any suspicions?</p><p>“Wait…H-How do we know we can--?” 
Celeste began behind her.</p><p>“Trust me?” Minako immediately intervened and looked the 
other woman in the eye. Celeste was expecting a flash of anger or perhaps an indignant air 
in the diplomat’s blue eyes, but she was surprised to see nothing but determination and 
compassion. “As I have said, my companions are not foolish children. They are not even 
normal diplomats for that matter! Especially the leader of Mars...” She turned to face Soren 
once again. “If we hurry, we can prevent Baroach from carrying out his under-handed tactics. 
Once I meet up with my comrades, I will speak to them of our agreement. This, I give you my 
word. And if my word is not good enough, <i>you</i> may hold my life for ransom.”</p><p><i>I 
just want to see Rei again… </i></p><p>And this time it was truly a sight to behold. The 
diplomat of Venus bowed <i>her</i> head!</p><p><i>Please help me.</i></p><p>Soren walked up 
to Minako, and then did something odd himself. He lightly bopped the top of her head with 
his fist.</p><p>“Hey, none of that now...I believe you. Sir Haruka had always stressed that 
it isn’t always appearance and blood that ties a family. You told us the truth about 
yourself, and believed in us… so although you come from a different planet, please feel free 
to consider yourself as one of us now.” Minako looked up in time to Soren raise Uranus’s 
sword high into the air. “Fellow Brothers and Sisters! Here and now you have witnessed our 
agreement! With my authority as Commander, and on behalf of our leader, Uranus, we now swear 
our allegiance to the Inner Alliance! Let us take back our home!”</p><p>The crowd 
cheered.</p><p><b>RAAAAAAAAH!</b></p><p>Soren then pointed out two men closest to 
him.</p><p>“You two, go send word to Kali! Tell her of our agreement with the Inner 
Alliance, and to attack the prison as soon as possible; break out as many as we can. We’re 
going to go full out this time!”</p><p>“Yes sir!” They saluted, and hurried 
away.</p><p>“Once we’ve assigned our divisions and determine our battle strategy we will 
commence the attack,” Soren informed Minako. “In the meantime, Celeste will escort you to 
one of the servant chambers. We will send a messenger to inform you when we are ready to 
depart. I would suggest keeping a low profile until then. There are already many soldiers in 
this place, and Baroach will likely increase security now that the diplomats and the Martian 
ruler are within his sphere of influence.”</p><p>“All right, I understand.” She 
nodded.</p><p>“Don’t worry! I’ll take good care of you.” Celeste slung a free arm over 
Minako’s shoulders and winked. “We’ll get your friends out of here before you know it. We 
always keep our word!”</p><p>“Mm… And so do I.”</p>
