<h1>Super Sailor Mercury: Shattered Ice (part 27 of 34)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/shattice-ch26.html">Back to Part 26</a><pre>The fangirl squeals made Taiki wince a bit as they got
out of the van, the three young men called the Three
Lights heading off to another school day. &quot;You all
right?&quot; Seiya asked quietly, the black haired young
man giving his brother a perceptive look.

&quot;Just tired,&quot; Taiki admitted, &quot;staying up helping you
three finish you assignments takes a lot out of me.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t need that much help,&quot; Yaten scowled, the
shorter white haired boy striding along beside them.

&quot;Right,&quot; Seiya drawled. He sighed slightly as he
admitted, &quot;But you&#39;re right, we can&#39;t keep relying on
you to carry us.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not quite that bad,&quot; Taiki noted, his long brown
hair tied back in a pony-tail, &quot;all of us are busy
with our roles.&quot;

Several girls sighed dreamily as the three walked to
their lockers, but thankfully they were no longer
being mobbed. While the students were still somewhat
in awe of the three, they had at least started to get
used to the celeberties presence.

&quot;So if it is a problem,&quot; Yaten grumbled as he got his
books out then shut the locker door, &quot;what can we do
about it?&quot;

&quot;Recruit a tutor,&quot; Taiki shrugged, &quot;that way I can
work with one of you and the tutor the other. We&#39;d get
done much faster.&quot;

Yaten gave him a pained look, &quot;You&#39;re kidding, right?
I can&#39;t think of anyone in the school who wouldn&#39;t go
fangirl on us in a situation like that.&quot;

Taiki looked amused, &quot;I can think of one.&quot;

&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Saiya blinked, realizing where he was
going with this.

&quot;Oooh,&quot; Yaten smiled, &quot;her!&quot;

&quot;You three look like you&#39;re plotting mischief,&quot; a
amused voice noted.

Seiya looked up, his eyes narrowuing as a spark of
dislike shot between him and Haruka Tenoh. Some people
got along instantly, others didn&#39;t., but with these
two it had been dislike at first sight. Annoyingly,
Yaten and Taiki got along reasonably well with the
sandy brown haired young woman, which made it hard to
give her the cold shoulder.

&quot;We are not plotting,&quot; Seiya said flatly.

&quot;Scheiming, maybe,&quot; Taiki noted.

&quot;Or possibly planning,&quot; Yaten jumped in.

&quot;But not plotting,&quot; Taiki finished.

Seiya rolled his eyes at the two boys attempt at
humor. &quot;Thanks a lot,&quot; he sighed.

Michiru looked amused as the green haired woman
casually look Haruka&#39;s arm. &quot;It&#39;s so hard being
surrounded by wise guys,&quot; she said to Seiya with a
twinkle in her eye.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Seiya said with a exagerated bow, &quot;nice
to see someone who understands my plight.&quot;

&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Haruka rolled her eyes.

&quot;So,&quot; Michiru looked curious, &quot;what&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re plotting something again,&quot; Haruka noted.
Taiki opened his mouth and Haruka said, &quot;Not again, it
wasn&#39;t that funny the first time.&quot;

&quot;Awww,&quot; Yaten pouted.

Taiki quickly sketched in their school difficulties
then asked, &quot;Do you think Ami might agree to help
tutor us?&quot;

&quot;It wouldn&#39;t be easy,&quot; Haruka noted, silently debating
what to say.

&quot;I know she&#39;s busy with classes,&quot; Yaten said
thoughtfully, &quot;but...&quot;

Michiru spoke softly, &quot;Her daughter takes a lot of her
time, too.&quot;

You could have heard a pin drop as Yaten, Taiki and
SEiya looked at Michiru with faintly stunned looks.
&quot;Daughter?&quot; Seiya managed to get out.

&quot;Ami was trying to keep it quiet,&quot; Haruka actually
frowned at Michiru.

&quot;I think we can trust in their discretion,&quot; Michiru
said, turning a piercing gaze on the three boys.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Taiki said with a firm nod.

&quot;How...?&quot; Yaten started just as the warning bell for
the beginning of classes rang.

Haruka silently debated for a moment then she said to
all three, &quot;We&#39;ll talk about it at lunch, all right?&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; Seiya agreed as they hurried to morning
classes.

Taiki frowned thoughtfully as the three boys entered
their class, sitting in their seats as the other
students began to arrive. &quot;Did you miss that when you
looked into her?&quot; Yaten whispered to him softly.

&quot;Obviously, I didn&#39;t dig deep enough,&quot; Taiki conceded.

&quot;Hello,&quot; Ami Mizuno nodded greetings to other students
as she entered, her boy&#39;s uniform as crisply neat as
ever. The scar across her nose was visible as always,
though many students had noticed a decreasing in her
serious manner in the past few weeks.

&quot;Morning,&quot; Seiya nodded, silently wondering what sort
of girl Ami might have as a daughter. &#145;She&#39;s way too
young to have had one, right?&#39; he mused.

&quot;Taiki,&quot; Ami smiled wryly, &quot;how did you do with the
physics?&quot;

&quot;Got it,&quot; Taiki tapped a note book.

Ami smiled a bit sheepishly as she asked, &quot;Even the
trick question?&quot;

Taiki looked a bit embarrassed, &quot;I must admit, I had
to look into the quantum physics question online. Do
you think it was included as a challenge or did sensei
make a mistake?&quot;

&quot;Could be either one,&quot; Ami admitted.

&quot;Are you following this?&quot; Seiya asked Yaten.

&quot;No,&quot; Yaten doodled on a sheet of paper.

&quot;Me too,&quot; Seiya sighed, glad he wasn&#39;t in the advanced
classes with Taiki and Ami.

Classes dragged, between the course work and wondering
what Haruka was going to tell them. Finally lunch came
and Ami slipped away, presumedly off to spend some
time with her girlfriend. More than once Seiya had
been tempted to follow her, but he knew Ami would be
furious if she caught him.

Entering the cafeteria girls frantically waved to open
seats nearby them but the three headed to a corner
table, one in which Haruka and Michiru had already
saved them seats. &quot;Thanks,&quot; Yaten said as they sat
with their lunch boxes.

&quot;No problem,&quot; Haruka said casually, all of them
cracking open their food and digging in.

Michiru studied the three boys, &quot;What I&#39;m going to
tell you has to stay private.&quot;

&quot;Because Ami might get in trouble with the school?&quot;
Seiya guessed, pausing with s bit of rice on it&#39;s way
to his mouth.

&quot;No, she cleared it with the school,&quot; Haruka looked
faintly pained, &quot;but if Ami finds out we&#39;re talking
about her private life she&#39;ll kill us.&quot;

Taiki smiled wryly as he munched, &quot;I can imagine. You
can rely on my discretion.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t tell,&quot; both Yaten and Seiya agreed.

Haruka looked at Taiki, &quot;I&#39;m willing to bet you did
some research on her.&quot;

Taiki didn&#39;t even try to deny it. &quot;Ace student, fairly
standard life up till a year ago when she and a young
girl...&quot; Taiki trailed off as his eyes widened. &quot;I&#39;m a
idiot.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Seiya demanded.

&quot;I should have thought of it,&quot; Taiki shook his head in
disbelief.

&quot;If I don&#39;t get an explaination soon,&quot; Yaten frowned,
&quot;I&#39;m gonna scream.&quot;

&quot;Ami and Usagi were the only survivors of a mysterious
attack in Tokyo last year,&quot; Michiru explained quietly,
&quot;they had been friends before, and when Ami discovered
Usagi had no other family she took her in.&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Seiya murmured.

&quot;Both of them were in pretty rough shape for awhile,&quot;
Haruka added gravely, &quot;and were chased my the news
media. As you can imagine, Ami&#39;s a bit gun-shy about
talking about her home life.&quot;

&quot;I can imagine,&quot; Yaten admitted, the three boys well
aware of the dark side of fame.

&quot;So, if you ask Ami for her help, I can&#39;t guarentee
she&#39;ll say yes,&quot; Michiru said as she delicately ate,
&quot;Usagi is a priority to her.&quot;
