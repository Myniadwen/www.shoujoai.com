@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;

I&#146;m sorry...

&#147;Makoto...&#148; Edwina gently nudges her awake. &#147;We&#146;re there, Makoto.&#148; She 
whispers into her ear. She found that Makoto was hounded by 
nightmares, leaving an observer helpless. The only way to calm her 
down was to brush her bangs out of her face and tell her you&#146;re there. 
&#147;Come on...&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148; Makoto yawns tiredly and opens her eyes. &#147;What time is it?&#148; She 
sits up and takes in her surroundings. &#147;Where are we?&#148;

&#147;We&#146;re in Cranbrook, BC. And it&#146;s...&#148; Edwina looks at her wristwatch. 
&#147;12:27 a.m.&#148;

&#147;Cranbrook?&#148; Makoto rubs her eyes and yawns. &#147;Alright. Thank you for 
taking me this far-&#147;

&#147;Cherie.&#148; Edwina brushes back Makoto&#146;s sweat covered hair. &#147;I don&#146;t 
like leaving you like this.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m fine, Edwina.&#148; Makoto brushes her lips against her knuckles. &#147;I 
just have to get to Swift Current. From there my uncle will pick me 
up.&#148;

&#147;Cherie.&#148; Edwina looks at her firmly. &#147;I&#146;m not going to let you hitch 
hike all the way to Winnipeg!&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s not Winnipeg...&#148; Makoto mumbles, pulling the blanket closer to 
herself. &#147;It&#146;s Portage La Prairie.&#148;

&#147;That just an hour...you know what? I&#146;m going to buy you a bus ticket. 
Only He knows you won&#146;t be getting on a plane anytime soon.&#148; Already 
planning ahead, Edwina turns her car back on and drives. &#147;My family&#146;s 
here, and I am really sorry that this is as far as I could take you.&#148;

&#147;Edwina.&#148; Makoto looks around her frantically. She wasn&#146;t used to 
people being so nice to her. Like once they got off the plane, Edwina 
had fed her and offered to drive her into Canada. Makoto didn&#146;t want 
to impose of course, but she also pointed out that this would be the 
fastest and cheapest way to get to Ami. &#147;You&#146;ve already done so much 
for me.&#148;

&#147;Not really. You paid for your own meals. I just took you along for 
the ride.&#148; Edwina pulls into the bus station and gets out. She walks 
around the front of the car and opens Makoto&#146;s door for her. &#147;You can 
pay me back the next time we meet, Cherie.&#148;

Makoto steps out of the door and walks into the station, Edwina at her 
side. &#147;I&#146;ll pay for half of it, then.&#148; They both walk up to the 
counter and wait for the receptionist.

@;-&gt;--

8 September 2003

&#147;Hey, dad.&#148; Ami leans over and kisses the top of his head. She takes 
her seat beside him. She checks the monitors and becomes disheartened 
to know that he has not improved. &#145;At least he&#146;s not getting any 
worse.&#146; Ami rakes her hand through her hair. She had barely gotten any 
sleep last night, and this morning, her mother had made her eat then 
took her out to see the city.

&#147;Well...what was I telling you yesterday?&#148; Ami asks the prone life 
form. She sighs and lays her head on the bed. &#147;Right. Well...I wish 
Makoto were here.&#148;

@;-&gt;--

&#147;Excuse me, sir?&#148;

&#147;Yeah?&#148;

&#147;What time is it?&#148;

&#147;Five o&#146;clock.&#148;

&#147;Thank you.&#148; Makoto bows politely and continues walking. She had 
gotten off at Regina around two, and cashed in the rest of her ride. 
She ate and began walking. &#145;So that&#146;s...nearly three-&#145;

&#147;Hey, Miss!&#148; A woman in her thirties runs out of the garage and onto 
the street. She wipes the grease off on her apron. &#147;Are you lost?&#148;

&#147;No, ma&#146;am.&#148; Makoto shakes her head. She stretches briefly and waits 
for her to continue.

&#147;Where&#146;re you heading?&#148;

&#147;Portage la Prairie.&#148; Makoto state, matter-of-factly. &#147;Right now, I 
should be in Balgonie, right?&#148;

&#147;Yeah.&#148; The woman takes a good look at her, sizing her up for 
something. &#147;Can you cook?&#148;

&#147;Yes&#148;

&#147;Clean?&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148;

&#147;Carry heavy objects?&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148;

&#147;Tell you what, you help me clean out the barn out back and I&#146;ll drive 
you to Elkhorn, Manitoba. Including pay.&#148;

Makoto runs it through her mind. If she took the woman&#146;s offer, she 
might be able to save quiet a few hours. Maybe even a day. Then 
there&#146;s the money. &#145;It&#146;s not like I like hitchhiking...&#146; &#147;How long 
will this take?&#148;

&#147;The sooner we finish the sooner we leave.&#148;

&#147;All right.&#148; Makoto sticks out her hand. &#147;Kino Makoto...ah...M-Makoto 
Kino.&#148;

&#147;Lea Paishk.&#148; Lea takes Makoto&#146;s hand and shakes it firmly. &#147;You might 
want to change, though. I&#146;m not sure you could work in...&#148; She waves 
her hand over Makoto&#146;s school uniform. &#147;That.&#148;

&#147;I could work in anything.&#148; Makoto shrugs, walking around the house 
into the back. &#147;If you stay away from the barn, we&#146;ll leave tonight.&#148; 
She calls back, not waiting for an answer. She puts her bag down and 
pushes the gates open. Inside was a total mess; broken wood, chains, 
tools, hay, engines and even a cow. Makoto blinks. &#145;This reminds me of 
Adrian&#146;s house...&#146; But noticing that most things were heavy objects, 
Makoto pulls out her transformation pen.

&#147;JUPITER STAR POWER!!&#148;

Sailor Jupiter smirks. &#145;Ohhhh yeahhhh...&#146; Dusting off her hands, 
Jupiter sets to work. 

 @;-&gt;--

&#147;Minako&#146;s the blonde one. She&#146;s selfish and shallow but she just loves 
romance. I&#146;ve noticed that Makoto never tries to correct her when she 
gets her quotes wrong.&#148; Ami shrugs, now squeezing a stress ball. It 
was almost time for her to go now, but how could she leave him like 
this? &#145;All I want for my birthday is for him to wake up. Please...&#146; 
Ami blinks back tears. &#147;Maybe she just gave up on trying but I don&#146;t 
think so. I think she&#146;ll just let Minako say it how she wants, as long 
as it makes her happy and doesn&#146;t get herself into trouble...&#148; The 
tears come again but this time, she doesn&#146;t fight them as she looks 
down at her watch. She had to leave in a few minutes. &#147;All I want is 
for you to wake up...&#148;? 

&#147;Ami...&#148; Wanda walks in with a wet rag and goes over to stand beside 
Ami. &#147;He&#146;s not going to be waking up tonight. You&#146;re doing a lot by 
talking to him, Ami. But I&#146;m sure he wouldn&#146;t want you to stress like 
this over him. You&#146;re going to end up making yourself sick.&#148;

&#147;I know, but...&#148; Ami takes the rag and wipes her face. It was cool so 
it would help her hold back the tears. &#147;Thank you, Wanda. For 
everything.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m glad I could help but-&#147;

&#147;Thank you.&#148; Ami repeats. She kisses her dad and tells him she&#146;ll see 
him tomorrow. Ami gets up and just as quick, falls to the ground.

&#147;When was the last time you ate?&#148; Wanda asks, helping her up off the 
ground.

&#147;Ah...&#148; Ami thinks back. &#147;This morning.&#148; She and Wanda both shake 
their heads. Ami&#146;s breath catches involuntarily and she collapses 
again. She brings her hand up to her chest, gasping for breath. Wanda 
lays her on her back.

&#147;Just breath, Ami. Ami!&#148;

The last thing Ami heard was the sound of her mother&#146;s frantic voice. 
Suddenly everything goes white.

/&#147;Are you alright?&#148;/

&#147;What?&#148; Ami looks around her. Nothing and no one was there. She was 
alone in an endless white void.

/&#147;What do you think?&#148; A child screams./

&#147;What&#146;s going on?&#148; Now Ami was frantic. Some one, a child, was crying. 
&#147;Who are you?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s alright Ami.&#148; Ami whips around and gasps. &#147;...Makoto...&#148;

/&#147;Leave me alone!&#148;/

&#147;What&#146;s going on...?&#148; Ami walks into Makoto&#146;s arms, seeking comfort. 
Feeling Makoto&#146;s real, she brings her hands up and pulls her closer. 
&#147;I&#146;m scared, Makoto...&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t be.&#148; Makoto strokes her hair gently. Colour swirls around them. 
Shapes form, but it was still too blurry to see anything.

/&#147;Miss Kino!&#148;/

/&#147;NO!!&#148; A thunderbolt hurtles itself across the room and destroys the 
bookshelf behind the servants. &#147;Just leave me alone...&#148; Makoto 
collapses to the ground crying. A young boy wraps his arms around her. 
&#147;Please...&#148; Makoto tries to push him away but he remains relentless./

&#147;Makoto?&#148; Ami looks away from the children on the ground and up into 
Makoto&#146;s solemn emerald eyes. &#147;I don&#146;t...understand.&#148;

&#147;Neither do I...&#148; Makoto clears her voice, takes a quick look around 
then looks down at Ami. &#147;This happened a while after my parents died. 
I just don&#146;t remember...the bookshelf.&#148;

&#147;Who&#146;s that-&#147; Ami gasps, startled. They weren&#146;t in the room anymore. 
They were in a sea of flowers. 

&#147;What&#146;s going on?&#148; Makoto steps in front of Ami, a maternal instinct 
told her they were not alone. &#147;Where are you!&#148; Makoto turns her wide 
eyes behind them to push Ami out of the way in time for the fist to 
miss her. Makoto takes hold of the wrist and flips the assailant over 
her hip, a few metres away. The figure spins in the air and lands on 
his feet. Before Makoto could take a good look, the man leapt into the 
air. She closes her eyes and waits, knowing that if she tried to 
follow, she&#146;d only blind herself by the sun. She easily falls into a 
crouching position, rolls back and kicks upwards, pushing him up and 
away. The assailant sails through the air and lands harshly on his 
back.

Makoto curls up, pushes herself up with her arms and lands gracefully 
on her feet. &#147;Now. Tell me who you are.&#148; She casually turns her back 
on the assailant and helps Ami to her feet. &#147;Are you okay?&#148;

&#147;Yeah.&#148; Ami nods warily.

The man behind her starts laughing. &#147;You always had balls, Koto.&#148;

Makoto slowly turns around, her face deathly pale. &#147;Papa?&#148; Tears 
spring into her eyes but she blinks them back. A woman&#146;s arm snakes 
around Makoto&#146;s neck, holding a lily under her nose. 

&#147;Sorry we took so long.&#148; The woman pulls Makoto into a hug from 
behind. &#147;I&#146;m sorry-&#147;

&#147;Mom...&#148; Makoto clears her throat and steps away, hiding her eyes. 
&#147;What&#146;s going on?&#148;

&#147;You never were big on manners.&#148; Makoto&#146;s mom had thick chestnut hair 
and grey eyes. She walks over to her husband, who had an odd 
combination of jet-black hair and emerald eyes.

&#147;Makoto?&#148; Ami tentatively lays her hand on Makoto&#146;s arm, unsure of the 
girl&#146;s reaction. 

&#147;Seems we&#146;ll have to do this ourselves.&#148; The man walks up to them, 
takes Ami&#146;s hand and gently kisses her knuckles. &#147;I&#146;m Kino Colt.&#148; The 
man smirks at Makoto. &#147;But you can call me papa.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m Mirium Kino.&#148; Makoto&#146;s mom takes Ami&#146;s hand and shakes it 
delicately. &#147;Makoto&#146;s-&#147;

&#147;No.&#148; Makoto takes Ami&#146;s hands in her own and steps back. &#147;My parents 
died in a plane crash. You can no longer use them against me.&#148; She 
steps in front of Ami, facing her parents, electricity forming around 
her hands. &#147;Goodbye.&#148;

&#147;SUPREME THUNDER CLAP!!&#148;

@;-&gt;--

9 September 2003

&#147;Makoto. We&#146;re there.&#148; Lea brushes back her strawberry blonde hair and 
shakes Makoto. &#147;Wake up.&#148;

&#147;Ugh...&#148; Makoto rolls to the side and hits the door. &#147;What the...&#148; She 
blinks. &#145;Door?&#146; She sits up, yawns and stretches. &#147;Where are we? 
W-what day is it?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s September 9th um...&#148; Lea waves her hand, dismissing the rest. 
&#147;And you&#146;re in Portage la Prairie.&#148;

&#148;I thought you were only going to take me to Elkhorn.&#148; Makoto wipes 
the sleep away from her eyes and yawns again. 

&#147;Yeah well...you saved me a couple days and it looked like you could 
use the sleep.&#148; Lea shrugs and looking at their surroundings she hands 
Makoto a sub. &#147;I figured I could take you a little farther. But now 
that I&#146;m here I don&#146;t know where to go.&#148;

&#147;...Thank you, Lea.&#148; Makoto wipes the tears from her eyes. She clears 
her throat and points further down the street. &#147;Just drop me off at 
the seven eleven.&#148; She eyes the sub curiously, checking the 
ingredients. A slow grin crosses her face and she bites into it, 
tasting it critically. &#147;This is good.&#148; After getting her observations, 
Makoto eats it like any normal teen her age. &#147;You know I&#146;m going to 
pay you back.&#148;

&#147;Oh no you don&#146;t.&#148; Lea parks her truck at Seven Eleven and gets out. 
She walks around the front and opens the door. &#147;I just took it from 
your salary.&#148;

&#147;...Good.&#148; Makoto packs the rest and gets out. &#147;I&#146;m going to call my 
uncle to send the-to send the car. When it comes, I want you to do me 
one last favour, okay?&#148;

&#147;Sure thing.&#148; She helps Makoto out and they walk into the store, side 
by side. &#147;One day, I&#146;m really going to get you.&#148;

&#147;For what?&#148;

&#147;One day...&#148; 

@;-&gt;--

&#147;It was just an anxiety attack.&#148; Ami pulls on her jacket. &#147;It&#146;s 
nothing to worry about.&#148; The image of Makoto&#146;s parents pops into her 
mind, but she quickly shakes it out. &#145;It wasn&#146;t really them.&#146;

&#147;But Ami...&#148; Wanda pulls Ami into a room and lowers her voice. &#147;This 
may be the only way you could stay the night. You know, to be with 
your father.&#148;

&#147;I know.&#148; Ami looks at the clock. She had to make a decision, and 
fast. &#147;But I can&#146;t just leave my mother alone. Besides, I feel bad 
lying. And tomorrow&#146;s your day off-&#147;

&#147;Because I&#146;m working the night shift.&#148; Wanda finishes. She sighs and 
walks Ami out the door. &#147;I really do hope he&#146;ll be up tomorrow. And if 
I can&#146;t make it... happy birthday.&#148;

&#147;Thank you, Wanda.&#148; Ami pulls her into a hug. Shortly after, she gets 
into her mother&#146;s car. 

&#147;I just wish that you could have spent it with your friends.&#148; Wanda 
gently closes the door before Ami could say anything and hurries back 
into the hospital.

&#147;Me too, Wanda. Me too.&#148; Ami sits there, staring at the hospital for a 
whiled before turning back to her mother. &#147;I&#146;m sorry, mom.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m just happy that you&#146;re alright.&#148; Kaya leans over and kisses Ami&#146;s 
forehead. &#147;My little girl...I&#146;m sorry they couldn&#146;t be here and I&#146;m 
sorry that he hasn&#146;t woken up.&#148;

&#147;There&#145;s nothing you could have done about it.&#148; Ami sits back and 
buckles her seatbelt. &#145;What would Makoto do in my shoes?&#146; The image of 
Makoto attacking- &#145;No. She&#146;d try to make light of the situation. But I 
can&#146;t.&#146; &#147;Shouldn&#146;t the shipment be in by now?&#148;

Kaya buys her way out of the parking lot and starts out. She screeches 
to a stop and honks her horn. &#147;Well look at that.&#148; Kaya shakes her 
head as the limo backs up to let her pass. &#147;Who in this city would 
drive a limo?&#148;

&#147;Hm?&#148; Ami glances at her mother but keeps her attention on the limo. 
The limo stops beside the hospital and someone gets out. &#147;Sorry, 
what?&#148; The figure staggers out and into the hospital. 

&#147;Did you see who it was?&#148;

&#147;No.&#148; Ami shakes her head, watching the Hospital disappear in the side 
view mirror.
