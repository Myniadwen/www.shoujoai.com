<h1>Minako's Warrior (part 3 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jwelch.html">Jessica Welch</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/minwar-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;I don&#39;t know if that will be possible Usagi. I have a lot of studying
to do this weekend.&quot; Ami explained.

&quot;But you have to come Ami. We&#39;re going to need you there to help us
deal with Rei.&quot; Usagi reasoned. They were at the Crown Arcade and Usagi
was trying to coordinate a slumber party for the weekend. She decided
that would be the best way to tell Ami and Rei about Mina and Makoto&#39;s
relationship. She fleetingly wondered if she should tell Minako and
Makoto what she was doing first.

&quot;What is so important that you need me to deal with Rei?&quot;

Usagi shifted her eyes around awkwardly. She leaned over and whispered
in Ami&#39;s ear. There was an eerie imagined silence before a bang. Usagi
was stunned. For the first time since the blonde had known her, Ami had
dropped her books.

*****

&quot;Minako! Makoto! Wait up!&quot; Usagi yelled as she tried to catch up with
them without tripping over her hair. She didn&#39;t succeed and fell on her
face after the sidewalk jumped up and snagged her. The two girls waited
patiently as Usagi made her way to them with a huge smile and a blush
across her face. &quot;I have great news you two. We&#39;re going to have a
slumber party and that way everyone will be there and you can tell
Rei.&quot;

&quot;Well that sounds like a good idea. We should think of how we&#39;re going
to tell Ami,&quot; Minako said to the green eyed brunette.

&quot;Oh I already told her...&quot; her sing songy voice was full of perky
happiness and pride.

&quot;You what?!?&quot; Makoto had paled considerably. It wasn&#39;t supposed to
happen like this. They were going to break the news gently, gauge
reactions, and not make any trouble. She was about to get irate with
Usagi when she felt Minako&#39;s hand on her arm.

Minako knew Usagi was just trying to help and by the other blonde&#39;s
reaction she could tell that nothing devastating had happened. She
turned a subtle smile and deep blue eyes on her love and said in a
soothing voice, &quot;Now Mooki, you remember what we discussed earlier
about anger management? Usagi was just trying to help and she did do us
a big favor. Now it won&#39;t be so worrisome trying to tell Ami since she
already knows.&quot;

Makoto just stared at Mina like she had grown three heads. Her face was
flushed with embarrassment. That was Mina&#39;s private nickname for her.
She looked at Usagi, whose eyes were big, and just wanted to be sucked
down into a Negaverse hole right then. She gave Usagi a death look
making it quite clear that if she spoke a word about her pet name there
would be serious trouble. Before Usagi could register the shriveling
look, Mina had asked her how Ami had received the news.

&quot;Well after she dropped her books and stood gaping for a good two
minutes she turned back to her brainiac self and went through a...
umm...&quot; at this moment Usagi fished in her pocket and pulled out a
piece of paper. She scanned it for several seconds finding her place
and read slowly &quot;...logical process of de..de...duc..tion.&quot; Usagi
grumbled something under her breath and shoved the paper into Makoto&#39;s
hands.

Makoto began reading the note. She didn&#39;t get to far before Mina
started pulling on her sleeve. &quot;What did she say? I want to read it
too. Read it out loud.&quot; Minako whined. An evil grin spread its way
across Makoto&#39;s face.

&quot;Now Koko, do you remember what we discussed earlier about self
restraint and patience?&quot; Makoto patted the blonde&#39;s head as she spoke.
She never called Minako Koko before, but the revenge was too sweet to
pass up. She received a hard smack on the arm for her pleasure as Usagi
peeled into laughter. &quot;OW, heh heh. I was only kidding.&quot; Minako just
gave her an icy glare that said ~ read the damn note ~

&quot;I concluded that your behavior of late has made sense now that Usagi
has told me you are romantically involved. I admit I was shocked
though. Have you discussed this with Luna? I was wondering what sort of
effect this will have on the team. I for one think it will bring us
closer together but I can see Luna having a different opinion on the
matter. As for Rei, I wouldn&#39;t worry too much. I will see you tonight.
There is much we should discuss.
-Ami&quot;

&quot;You know, you two sound like you should be on display at the zoo.&quot;
Mina and Mako turned to Usagi with a bewildered look. &quot;Mooki and
Koko... they sound like names for a couple of monkeys.&quot; The two shot
her a withering glare. Usagi started laughing and turned on her heel
running from the two primates.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mina, Mako, and Ami were walking together to Rei&#39;s Temple. Usagi said
she had to do some things at home first and would get there when she
was finished. Mako thought it was a good idea to talk to Ami before
they got to Rei&#39;s.

&quot;So that&#39;s pretty much the gist of it.&quot; Makoto finished the story with
only a few hundred interruptions from Mina who was &#39;helping&#39; her tell
it.

&quot;Well I think it&#39;s great that you two are together. I really think it
will bring the team closer. In fact on a technical level your awareness
will be higher, as will your adrenaline. If you are able to control
your respiration and keep your heart rate at a steady pace your
fighting skills will be enhanced. Reaction time should be reduced
also.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, sure Ami. You tell that to Luna if she harasses you about it.
Poor Artemis is in bad shape from the toe lashing he got from her.&quot;

&quot;Tongue lashing.&quot; Makoto corrected automatically.

Ami nodded and looked up at the stairs leading to the Shinto Shrine.
&quot;Well Rei shouldn&#39;t be too much of a problem. Do you want to discuss it
with her now or later tonight?&quot;

&quot;I think we&#39;ll wait till later. Maybe Usagi can divert some of her
anger.&quot; Makoto answered as they began climbing the stairs.

&quot;Out of curiosity, why do you think Rei will take the news so well
Ami?&quot; Mina asked.

*****

The five girls were all laying in their sleeping bags talking about
everything under the moon. Ami was studying and vaguely wondering how
the issue of Mina and Mako-chan was going to be presented. They had all
been here for three hours already and soon everyone would be going to
sleep. Usagi was busily chattering about Mamoru, the two love birds
were trying not to make goo goo eyes at each other. They had put their
sleeping bags across from each other. Rei was across from Usagi and
making sure to point out any inconsistencies with her story. Things
thus far had gone smoothly.

&quot;Anyway, Mamo-chan is being really great. He&#39;s taking off work Friday
night for our double date so everything is a go you two. We can go
shopping tomorrow and-&quot; Usagi was cut off by Rei. Mina covered her
mouth trying not to laugh at Usagi&#39;s latest slip. Makoto was stunned
into silence again, and Ami just continued to read like nothing had
happened.

&quot;What do you mean &#39;you two&#39;, if it&#39;s a double date then there can&#39;t be
three couples there right?&quot;

Makoto and Usagi were getting ready to respond but Ami clarified things
before they could untie their tongues. &quot;Minako and Makoto are dating
and they are going with each other on the double date with Usagi and
Mamoru. They&#39;re going to tell him there.&quot;

Rei&#39;s eyes narrowed considerable and she was about to start screeching
when Ami intoned again with a bored voice, not even looking up from her
book, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t make a big deal about it Rei. Not with me here and
what I know about you. They were just trying to find a way to break the
news to you and this was it.&quot;

Usagi was hugging the pillow to her chest knowing she made another big
goof and didn&#39;t catch the implication Ami just made. Makoto turned her
stunned stare to Mina not knowing what to think. Mina was about ready
to burst out laughing at the look on Rei&#39;s face. Her eyes looked like
they were ready to pop out of her head.

Ami continued, smoothing over the scene, &quot;So Mina-chan why don&#39;t you
tell Rei your little love story so she doesn&#39;t feel so left out.&quot; This
conveniently diverted the attention away from Rei and closed the topic
on what she knew about Rei. It was quite clear it was not available for
discussion at the moment. It was also quite clear that Ami had Rei
under her thumb more that any of them had realized before.

Minako told the tale complete with gestures and reenactment scenes. It
was entertaining to the rest of the girls and slightly embarrassing to
Makoto as she was portrayed as the walking dead in one part, and a baka
head in the park, near the end. Mina made a point of embellishing how
stealth she was about the necklace. She did leave out some of the parts
when they were under the overpass which was what Makoto was hoping for.
Usagi clapped at the end and was teary eyed. Ami had a smile on her
face. Rei&#39;s chin was resting on her knee with her arms wrapped around
her legs.

&quot;So what do you think?&quot; Mina asked Rei.

&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair...&quot; She looked around at the rest of them,
avoiding Ami&#39;s eyes. Makoto began to protest but Rei cut her off. &quot;I
don&#39;t think its fair that YOU get to go shopping tomorrow with out US!&quot;
With that she threw a pillow at Usagi&#39;s head knocking the blonde
backwards.

&quot;HEY! WITCH!&quot; Usagi hurled a pillow back at the raven haired villain.
It was deflected and smashed into Makoto&#39;s face. Before she could
retaliate Minako jumped up with her own pillow and screamed.

&quot;PILLOW FIGHT!!!&quot;

A war ensued around the room with pillows and stuffed animals flying
through the air. Ami was eventually drawn into it by being targeted by
all four girls at once. The night had turned out fine. Rei was truly
happy for Mina and Makoto. Her loneliness had crept away after seeing
them play together. It wasn&#39;t their fault that her own crush would
never return her feelings. But at least Ami understood her. The blue
haired genius had been sworn to secrecy when she found Rei&#39;s doujinshi
pile, with little hearts marked all around every picture of a certain
Moon Princess.
