Mamoru had seen the films.  He&#39;d dutifully accompanied Usagi to 
all of the classes and worked with her on her breathing 
exercises.  He&#39;d patiently listened and sympathized with her as 
she&#39;d grown increasingly irritable, sore, ungainly, and generally 
sick of being pregnant.  When her due date passed without any 
sign that Chibi-Usa was ready to make her grand debut, he had 
commiserated with his wife and gone on long walks with her, 
trying to help the process along.  Both he and Usagi were anxious 
for the baby to be born, but for different reasons.  He couldn&#39;t 
wait to hold her in his arms.  She was tired of having to pee all 
the time and being unable to stand up without assistance.  

Of course, everyone knew when Chibi-Usa&#39;s birthday was, but Usagi 
still had seemed somewhat determined to get her out as soon as 
possible.  Some women took well to being pregnant.  Usagi was not 
one of them.  Mamoru wondered which phrase he had heard more 
often over the last few months, &quot;No more babies&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s all 
your fault&quot;.  

&quot;They never mentioned the smell,&quot; he thought as Usagi faded in 
and out of consciousness.  Mamoru sat up at his wife&#39;s bedside, 
close to her head and well away from where the actual work was 
being done.  Once the drugs had kicked in, she&#39;d calmed down 
quite a bit.  She&#39;d perk up with each contraction and then settle 
back into a daze in between.   On his last visit, their doctor 
had predicted that it would be another hour or so.  Mamoru wished 
he&#39;d thought to bring a book along.  He was also glad that Usagi 
had forbidden Hotaru from videotaping the event.  

A tight squeeze of his hand brought Mamoru back to the moment.  
&quot;You&#39;re doing great, Usako, just keep it up,&quot; he told her, wiping 
the sweat from her brow with a cool washcloth.  

&quot;Thanks, love,&quot; Usagi whispered, once again fading back into 
semi-consciousness.  

&quot;Do you want any ice chips?&quot; he asked.

&quot;No, I&#39;m fine,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;Just stay with me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll never leave you, darling,&quot; he replied, even as she closed 
her eyes.  &quot;I&#39;ll always be by your side.&quot;

It just didn&#39;t make any sense.  Though she wouldn&#39;t start medical 
school officially until the fall, Ami had a great deal of 
experience doing high-level research.   While she couldn&#39;t do any 
primary experimentation, she could and did review all the data 
and reports she could get her hands on.   Between her mother and 
Rei, she had access to just about every study being done on what 
was now being called &quot;hypercancer.&quot;  

Throughout her summer vacation, Ami had pored over all of these 
materials, trying to make sense of it, applying all of her 
prodigious intellect to the task.  Still, she couldn&#39;t find any 
angle to pursue, no line of inquiry that wasn&#39;t already being 
investigated, mostly without result.  Despite the lack of 
success, or perhaps because of it, Ami devoted more and more time 
to her work, to the exclusion of almost everything else. 

Deep down, Ami knew why she pushed herself so hard.  Yes, she did 
feel a true calling.  The mystery of this radical new disease had 
become a cause celebre throughout the world.  The fact that it 
had claimed the life of a childhood friend, and threatened the 
life of another only served to heighten her commitment.  Still, 
the long hours and diligent research also diverted her attention 
from the central fact of her own life.  She missed Makoto, more 
than she&#39;d ever imagined she would.  

Ami and Makoto still emailed every day.  They still called each 
other as often as they could, at least two to three times a week.  
They even sent letters, gifts, and little romantic greeting cards 
to each other from time to time.  Those things helped, a little.  
But every day they were apart, Ami could feel the cold, dark void 
inside of her growing.  She knew she could survive on her own, 
that she didn&#39;t need another person to find worth or value in 
herself.  None of that changed the fact that she was happier with 
Makoto near and miserable away from her.  

Pushing those thoughts aside for the millionth time, Ami flipped 
to the next medical journal.  Before she could really dig into 
the articles there, however, the phone rang.  A quick glance at 
her calendar verified what she&#39;d suspected.  Smiling for the 
first time in days, she picked up the receiver.

----------

Michiru hung up the phone and smiled at Haruka, Setsuna, and 
espeically Hotaru, all of whom waited anxiously at her side.

&quot;Everything is fine.  Chibi-Usa and her mommy are both doing well 
and sleeping.  Mamoru said we could go visit in the morning,&quot; she 
announced.

Hotaru cheered happily while Setsuna and Haruka exchanged looks 
of joy and relief.  No one had expected that there would be any 
problems, but believing and knowing were two different things.  

After Hotaru ran to her room to finish up the welcome basket she 
was working on, the other three Outers moved into the kitchen, 
along with the cats.  

&quot;So, what now?&quot; Haruka asked as she served tea to the humans and 
fresh milk to the kitties.  

Setsuna took a sip from her cup before replying.  &quot;I think it&#39;s 
time we told the others.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure this is what we need to do?&quot; Michiru frowned over 
her mug.  

&quot;The future is always cloudy,&quot; Setsuna explained, not for the 
first time, &quot;but some things shine clearly.  Our place has always 
been the outer rim.  Because of the disruptions caused by Queen 
Metallia and then Pharaoh Ninety, we have been needed in this 
place.  Though I cannot be certain of its exact nature, the next 
crisis is upon us.   Once again, we are needed here, but once it 
is complete, it will time to resume our duties.&quot;

Luna hopped up onto the table.  &quot;And you&#39;re sure you cannot tell 
what this threat is or when it will hit?&quot;

&quot;I thought that&#39;s what she just said,&quot; Haruka said defensively.  
Only her love for Michiru could rival the strength of her 
feelings for the guardian of time.  She was simultaneously 
advisor, mentor, sister and friend to both of her counterparts, 
not to mention their partner in raising young Hotaru.

Setsuna lifted her hand to let Haruka know everything was fine. 
Her understanding of the future and the past came so naturally, 
but was nearly impossible to explain to others.   She had long 
ago grown accustomed to their confusion.  &quot;Something is wrong, 
Luna, or soon will be.  King Endymion in Crystal Tokyo told us 
that something would come to pass in this time that would require 
the freezing of the entire world.  Though he did not mention it 
specifically, I can even now feel the call of my own planet.&quot;

Haruka and Michiru nodded.  It had started the night that Hotaru 
had opened Chibi-Usa&#39;s last message and gift.  It had grown 
stronger each day.  Their fates were pulling them to where they 
belonged, to the place where they were always meant to serve:  
the outer rim.

&quot;Are you sure we need to don&#39;t need to go now?&quot; Michiru asked 
quietly.  &quot;What if the threat is coming from beyond the solar 
system and we are not in place to meet it?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve considered that,&quot; Setsuna admitted, &quot;but from what I can 
glean and what I recall of Endymion&#39;s words, the threat begins 
and ends here on Earth.&quot;

Artemis joined Luna on the table, having finished off both his 
milk and hers while everyone else was speaking.  &quot;Well, I think 
Luna and I had better double our efforts.  We&#39;ve been scanning 
the whole planet and have found no spikes of negative energy that 
would indicate a new invasion.&quot;  Luna meowed her agreement.

Haruka rose to gather the dirty dishes.  &quot;Ok, I guess we keep on 
doing what we&#39;ve been doing.  We should let the others know that 
a threat may be looming, however.  I&#39;ll take care of that.  We 
can start with Minako, since we&#39;ll be seeing her at the benefit 
concert in just a couple weeks.&quot;

Michiru moved to help her love with her chore.  &quot;You&#39;re right, 
&#39;Ruka.  We should do it in person.  Such conversations shouldn&#39;t 
be done over the computer or the phone.&quot;  

As the two of them worked together, Setsuna excused herself and 
went to check on Hotaru.  They&#39;d need to tell her, too, though 
Setsuna suspected that she already knew.  It was difficult to 
tell what Hotaru knew and didn&#39;t know, both of the future and of 
the past.  That was one reason the two of them got along so well.  
Being mysterious was a difficult business.  

----------

Ikuko laid the sleeping baby back in her crib, marveling again at 
how very small she was.  She began to try to recall what it had 
been like to hold Usagi and Shingo when they were newborns, but 
that line of thought threatened to bring on tears and Ikuko had 
no desire to break down on this happy day.  

Laying a hand over her shoulders, Mamoru guided his mother-in-law 
to the recliner in the corner.  Usagi still slept, worn out from 
her exertions and the various painkillers in her system.  Despite 
all of that, though, Mamoru could not recall a time when she had 
appeared more beautiful to him.  

&quot;I wish Kenji could have made it,&quot; Ikuko said gently.  &quot;It&#39;s hard 
for him to make it into the city any more.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s ok, we&#39;ll take her to see him in a day or two,&quot; Mamoru 
reassured her.  &quot;And, you have plenty of pictures to take home 
with you.&quot;

Ikuko laughed, looking at the pile of photos on the table next to 
her.  She had gone through two rolls of instant film.  &quot;He&#39;ll be 
anxious to see them, but he can wait a little bit.&quot;  She gazed 
fondly at both her sleeping babies.  

Mamoru smiled knowingly.  He too had no desire to be anywhere 
other than in this room with the two most important people in the 
world to him.  As the sun set outside, the two of them enjoyed 
the tranquility of the moment, knowing that all too soon, it 
would pass.
