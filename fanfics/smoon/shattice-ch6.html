<h1>Super Sailor Mercury: Shattered Ice (part 6 of 34)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/shattice-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>        &quot;Come on in,&quot; Ami smiled to her mother as she opened up her 
front door. This was the first time she had invited her mother here 
to the apartment and she felt a little nervous.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Nicole smiled over at her daughter fondly. The two 
blue haired women walked through an almost spotlessly clean house, 
ending up in the kitchen where they sat down at the table. Her lips 
quirked in a smile, &quot;I almost think I could do a white glove 
inspection.&quot;

        A blush marked Ami&#39;s cheek, &quot;It&#39;s not that bad.&quot; She made 
them each cups of tea, then sat down across from her mother. The 
doctor looked so relaxed, a poise that Ami envied just a bit.

        &quot;So any progress to report with the others?&quot; Nicole leaned 
forward to ask.

        Ami looked startled, then she smiled. &quot;I forgot to tell you,&quot; 
she said, &quot;I finally went over to see the Outers after we had our 
last little talk.&quot;

        &quot;How did it go?&quot; her mother asked eagerly.

        &quot;A bit awkward at first,&quot; Ami admitted, &quot;but we managed to 
talk.&quot; She hesitated, &quot;They asked me to be their leader.&quot;

        Nicole leaned back in her chair, looking over at her daughter 
thoughtfully. &#39;You accepted?&quot; she asked her softly.

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Ami nodded firmly.

        &quot;Good,&quot; Nicole smiled. She looked at Ami curiously and 
asked, &quot;Do you know a nurse named Setsuna Meiou?&quot;

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Ami said softly, &quot;why?&quot;

        &quot;She was asking around about you at the hospital,&quot; Nicole 
said with a smile, &quot;politely trying to get any gossip, I think.&quot; She 
gave her daughter an intent look, &quot;Are you two involved?&quot;

        &quot;No!&quot; Ami blurted out.

        &quot;Too bad, she&#39;s a good looking young woman,&quot; Nicole said 
calmly. Ami was looking over at her in shock, and Nicole sighed to 
herself softly. &quot;I wondered about you and Makoto,&quot; she said to Ami 
gently, &quot;but I guess not.&quot;

        If Ami&#39;s face got any brighter red, she&#39;d probably 
faint. &quot;You could have just asked,&quot; she said weakly. She shook her 
head firmly, &quot;Setsuna and I are colleagues, maybe friends.&quot;

        &quot;I know you&#39;ve never been comfortable with talking about this 
sort of thing,&quot; Nicole said to her gently. She took a drink of her 
tea before adding, &quot;In some ways, I wish I had pressed you a little 
more about it then.&quot;

        &quot;Mom!&quot; Ami protested.

        Nicole smirked, putting her cup down. &quot;So what are the other 
Outers like?&quot; she asked.

        Ami puffed out a breath, feeling a bit better that the focus 
wasn&#39;t so much on her anymore. &quot;Haruka is tough, almost boyish,&quot; she 
said, &quot;she comes across as almost cold, but she has a softer side, 
too.&quot; Ami smiled slightly, thinking bacl to the duet that she had 
seem Haruka and Michiru play together on violin and piano.

        &quot;Her partner Michiru..&quot; Ami started, only to stop at a 
gesture from her mother.

        &quot;Partner? As in..?&quot; Nicole raised an eyebrow.

        &quot;I don&#39;t know for sure if they&#39;re lovers,&quot; Ami admitted, &quot;but 
I do think they are.&quot; She took a breath, &quot;Michiru comes across as 
delicate, and she&#39;s the more feminine of the pair. But there&#39;s a core 
of iron in her, I think.&quot;

        &quot;And the little girl that Chibi-Usa likes?&quot; Nicole asked.

        &quot;Hotaru,&quot; Ami smiled slightly, &quot;in an odd way she reminds me 
of myself at that age. Dreadfully serious, though I think Chibi-Usa 
gets her to have some fun. She can be oddly intense, almost eerily 
insightful, then go back to being an ordinary child.&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t envy those girls trying to raise her,&quot; Nicole mused. 
She drank some more tea, &quot;So, do you find Setsuna attractive?&quot;

        &quot;Mom!&quot;

        Walking in the park along with Chibi-Usa and Hotaru, Setsuna 
sneezed suddenly. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; she blushed faintly, long black hair 
flowing over her shoulders. Dressed in casual wear, she looked 
comfortably sophisticated.

        &quot;That&#39;s the third time you&#39;ve done that,&quot; Chibi-Usa looked up 
at her worriedly before the pink haired little girl added, &quot;do you 
think you&#39;re getting sick?&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s all right, Small Lady,&quot; Setsuna smiled down at her 
gently, &quot;I guess someone must be talking about me.&quot;

        &quot;Like Ami, maybe?&quot; Hotaru offered with a grin.

        A bit of a blush colored Setsuna&#39;s cheeks, &quot;Why do you say 
that?&quot;

        &quot;Probably because you&#39;ve been worried about Ami from the 
start,&quot; Haruka noted as she walked up with Michiru, both of them 
carrying the cups of hot chocolate.

        Michiru passed cups out to Chibi-Usa and Hotaru, Haruka gave 
one to Setsuna, then they all walked off together. &quot;So what&#39;s going 
on?&quot; Michiru asked as the green haired young lady watched the two 
little girl&#39;s ran off together.

        Setsuna sighed softly, feeling her friends&#39; intense gazes on 
her. &quot;I met her long before you two did,&quot; she finally said 
softly, &quot;when an adversary sent enemies from the future into the past 
to challenge the Senshi. Even then she drew my attention, but I knew 
we would meet again eventually.&quot; She paused, &quot;Then Fiore attacked...&quot;

        Haruka finally said aloud something that the sandy haired 
woman had expected all along, &quot;That wasn&#39;t what was supposed to 
happen, was it?&quot;

        &quot;They were meant to face Fiore,&quot; Setsuna said to them 
softly, &quot;but in the timeline I knew, they weren&#39;t slain in their 
first battle. They recovered, and eventually defeated him.&quot;

        &quot;So history has gone off the rails,&quot; Michiru said softly. Her 
eyes widened, &quot;Is that why Ami didn&#39;t sent Chibi-Usa back home?&quot;

        &quot;I suspect so,&quot; Setsuna agreed grimly, &quot;I do not know what 
might happen if we return Chibi-Usa to her era with the timelines in 
flux, and I don&#39;t wish to find out.&quot;

        &quot;Getting back to Ami,&quot; Haruka sipped some of her drink, &quot;are 
you just attracted to her? Or is this something more serious?&quot;

        &quot;Subtle,&quot; Michiru noted, and Haruka shrugged.

        &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Setsuna softly confessed. She smiled 
wryly, &quot;I&#39;d like to get to know her better, but she&#39;s do damn 
unapproachable.&quot;

        &quot;She is opening up a bit,&quot; Haruka offered, &quot;but I think it&#39;ll 
just be a matter of time.&quot;

        Setsuna gave her a look, &quot;Was that intentional?&quot; Haruka 
smirked, and Setsuna sighed.

        &quot;Speaking of time,&quot; a smiling Michiru offered, &quot;it&#39;s probably 
nearly time we brought Chibi-Usa back to Ami&#39;s apartment.&quot;

        They all left the park, collecting a cheerful Chibi-Usa and 
Hotaru and walked back to the apartment building. The intercom 
buzzed, and they heard Ami&#39;s voice come through, &quot;Come on up, my 
guest wants to meet you.&quot;

        &quot;Who&#39;s the guest?&quot; Haruka asked softly.

        &quot;Guess we&#39;ll find out,&quot; Setsuna murmured back softly.

        They walked inside together, taking off their shoes at the 
door. They heard quiet talking in the kitchen, and the five of them 
made their way towards the voices. They saw Ami sitting in the 
kitchen first, then nearby her an older woman with the same 
distinctive blue hair.

        &quot;Haruka, Michiru, Setsuna and Hotaru,&quot; Ami pointed each one 
out subtlely, &quot;I&#39;d like you all to meet my mother, Nicole Mizuno.&quot;

        Nicole shook hands, murmuring greetings. Once she reached 
Setsuna she smiled slightly, &quot;I believe we met back at the hospital.&quot;

        Setsuna looked visibly pale under the woman&#39;s amused 
gaze, &quot;Yes, we did.&quot; She smiled ruefully, &quot;I just wish you had been 
wearing a name tag or something.&quot;

        &quot;I was on break,&quot; Nicole shrugged.</pre>
