<h1>Senshi: the Gathering of Five (part 28 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/senshi5-ch27.html">Back to Part 27</a><pre>Rei Hino felt herself rising back to consciousness,
the spell of sleep slowly falling aside. The black
haired young woman opened her eyes to look around the
white room dazedly, trying to fit in where she was now
with the last thing that she remembered. The Oni realm
had been collapsing all around them, Setsuna and Usagi
had crossed their weapons as the sorceress chanted,
there was a surge of power then ... blackness.

Rei tried to sit up, feeling a weight on her legs then
looked down at a blonde head resting on her legs.
&quot;Usagi?&#39; Rei blinked, reaching out to lay her hand on
her head.

&quot;Mom, I don&#39; ha&#39; to go to school today,&quot; Usagi
grumbled in her sleep.

&quot;Usagi, wake up,&quot; Rei felt herself smiling fondly as
she shook her again.

Blinking away sleep Usagi got up, then fully
registered who had wakened her. Throwing her arms
around the surprised Rei she said, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m so glad
you&#39;re awake!&quot;

&quot;Ow ow ow,&quot; Rei yelped in pain and Usagi let her go,
simply beaming at her happily. &quot;What happened?&quot; Rei
demanded fiercely.

Still gently holding on to Rei&#39;s shoulders Usagi
softly explained, &quot;You were hit in the head by a piece
of rock just before Setsuna could teleport us out.&quot;

Rei reached up to her head, mildly surprised to feel
the bandages there, &quot;Damn.&quot;

Usagi hesitated, &quot;We reappeared up at the temple,
scared your grandfather pretty badly. He and Setsuna
bandaged up you head and we rushed you to the
hospital.&quot;

&quot;I suppose Setsuna has disappeared on us now that it&#39;s
all over?&quot; Rei asked wryly, trying to get her head
around the idea.

Usagi finally let go, reaching for the nurse&#39;s call
button as she said, &quot;Not exactly.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Rei blinked.

A few moments later a tall, black haired nurse bustled
in, her hair bearing the oddest tinge of green. &quot;Nice
to see you&#39;re finally awake,&quot; Setsuna smiled as she
looked over Rei critically, &quot;you had us worried for a
bit.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a nurse?&quot; Something she said registered and
Rei asked warily, &quot;What do you mean, finally awake?&quot;

&quot;Usagi didn&#39;t tell you?&quot; Setsuna tossed a frown at her
then she addressed Rei, &quot;You&#39;ve been out for nearly
two weeks.&quot;

&quot;Two weeks,&quot; Rei echoed. She could feel her mind start
to work as she demanded, &quot;What happened to the
others?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re all right,&quot; Usagi quickly reassured her.

&quot;Recovering, anyway,&quot; Setsuna corrected. &quot;Ami and
Minako both have casts on, Michiru&#39;s strength is
coming back and Luna is healing nicely.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Rei murmured softly. She looked around
again at the depressingly white hospital room, &quot;How
soon can I get out of here?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve just woken from a coma, Hino,&quot; Setsuna
frowned.

&quot;But other than that, how am I?&quot; Rei challenged.

Setsuna sighed softly then gave up, &quot;All right, but
only if someone is up there at the temple to help take
care of you.&quot;

&quot;I volunteer,&quot; Usagi waved a hand, &quot;considering Makoto
has taken over my house to take care of Ami.&quot; She
frowned, &quot;Though why they&#39;re staying in the same room
I don&#39;t know.&quot;

Setsuna and Rei exchanged a look, then decided not to
say anything. &quot;If it helps any,&quot; Rei added as she
carefully eased her still mildly battered body off the
bed, &quot;I don&#39;t have a spare room, so we&#39;re going to
have to share.&quot;

A faint blush colored Usagi&#39;s cheeks as she said, &quot;I
don&#39;t think I&#39;d mind.&quot;

&quot;So what happened to Hotaru?&quot; Rei asked as Usagi
helped her dress, &quot;Is she still evil?&quot;

&quot;No exactly,&quot; Setsuna smiled mysteriously.

Across the city in a high rise apartment Minako Aino
looked out of her window, the blonde actress fiercely
scratching where her cast ended on her arm. &quot;You
really shouldn&#39;t do that,&quot; Hotaru Tomoe said, the
black haired woman&#39;s voice gently scolding.

&quot;But it itches,&quot; Minako complained, looking back at
her houseguest. The girl looked goth, pale skin and
black clothes giving her a very occult look.

&quot;Probably a sign that it&#39;s healing nicely,&quot; Hotaru
noted, putting a black gloved hand on Minako&#39;s arm to
stop her scratching.

Minako pulled her hand away from the red skin
reluctantly, &quot;And how are you feeling?&quot;

&quot;Odd,&quot; Hotaru conceded. She looked at her black gloved
hands, &quot;I&#39;m still an energy vampire like the Oni made
me, bare skin to skin causing me to absorb life
force.&quot;

&quot;Setsuna is working to find you a cure,&quot; Minako
offered reassuringly.

&quot;She&#39;s never seen a case like mine,&quot; Hotaru shook her
head, &quot;it could be years before she can find a cure
for my condition.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Minako reluctantly nodded. the two standing
there silently for a time. &quot;Have you thought about my
offer?&quot;

&quot;I thought Sailor V already had a partner?&quot; Hotaru
challenged.

&quot;Artemis is a little busy with Luna right now,&quot; Minako
looked amused by the thought.

&quot;I saw how Artemis took care of her,&quot; Hotaru nodded,
&quot;but I thought the others said that Luna hated him.&quot;

&quot;Apparently it&#39;s a little more complicated than that,&quot;
Minako chuckled before she revealed, &quot;apparently they
were engaged before Artemis took off with my chain.
That, it seems, was why she was so annoyed with him...
but now that they&#39;re on the same side she&#39;s forgiven
him.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s almost too sweet,&quot; Hotaru shook her head.

&quot;You have no sense of romance,&quot; Minako scolded. &quot;So,
would you be willing to use your gifts to help Sailor
V fight the remaining monsters in the world?&quot;

Hotaru nodded, &quot;Maybe it&#39;ll help make up for the
things I did under the Queen&#39;s control.&quot; Seriously,
&quot;I&#39;m not wearing a costume, though.&quot;

Minako chuckled, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t dream of it.&quot;

Hotaru hesitated, &quot;I remember hurting the water
spirit... is she all right?&quot;

&quot;I think so,&quot; Minako reassured her, &quot;I understand
Haruka is taking care of her.&quot;

Across the world there is a tropical island, one that
is so small that few have even noticed it. Now for the
first time there is a sign of human habitation, a
grass hut that sits amid the palm trees just above the
beach. Emerging from the hut Haruka smiles, the shorts
and T-shirt clad woman carrying two glasses as she
walked down to the beach.

Michiru lay on a lounging chair by the beach,
sunglasses shading the green haired young woman&#39;s
eyes. She smiled slightly as Haruka handed her a glass
the settled into her own chair right beside her. &quot;When
you said you were taking me away to take care of me,&quot;
Michiru said impishly, &quot;I wasn&#39;t expecting this.&quot;

&quot;The sea is here if you need to restore yourself,&quot;
Haruka chuckled, &quot;and while storms are rare here,
they&#39;re common enough I can come and go as I please.&quot;

Michiru took a drink, then set it on the stand between
them. &quot;Now,&quot; she slid her glasses down to reveal her
eyes, &quot;I think giving you two weeks to stall has been
long enough. You said you were going to explain your
change of heart... now spill.&quot;

&quot;This isn&#39;t easy for me,&quot; Haruka looked off into the
distance. &quot;I told you about my father, about how at
times he could be so fond of your memory, then
suddenly curse your name,&quot; she said.

&quot;I remember,&quot; Michiru nodded.

&quot;He often spoke of how contemptible, how degrading it
was that a woman would choose her own kind rather than
men,&quot; Haruka continued bitterly, &quot;you can imagine how
I felt when I realized I had such feelings dwelling in
me.&quot;

Michiru reached out to squeeze her hand, &quot;So you hid?&quot;

Haruka nodded, &quot;As much as I could, to please my
father. Even after he passed away I maintained the
pose... until Setsuna summoned me.&quot;

&quot;And we met,&quot; Michiru murmured.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Haruka nodded. &quot;I had never understood the
tales of love at first sight, until the,&quot; she
revealed, &quot;but when I saw you my heart skipped a
beat.&quot;

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Michiru murmured. She gave Haruka a teasing
look, &quot;You might have given me a sign, Windbag.&quot;

&quot;I was working against years or restraint,
Waterlogged,&quot; Haruka replied. She squeezed Michiru&#39;s
hand, &quot;What do you think of staying here together for
awhile?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Michiru gave her a smile.

The End

Notes: I could have probably pushed this to thirty
chapters with the wrap up, but I decided to keep it
all to one chapter, more or less. The only couple
that&#39;s &#39;blatant&#39; is Haruka/Michiru, though Ami/Makoto
and Rei/Usagi are strongly implied.

The basic idea for this came from the mental image of
a blood thirsty Usagi with a sword, and kind of just
rolled on from there. &#39;Mad Scientist&#39; Ami and &#39;Miko&#39;
Rei are both based on anime series archetypes, but I
have to admit &#39;Street Fighter&#39; Makoto is loosely based
on a character from the anime My Dear Marie (Metal
Angel Marie in the Dub). Sailor V is a darker version
of the character from Sailor Moon, as are the
redesigned Outers. I wanted the five core senshi to be
basically humans with weapons, while Setsuna, Haruka
and Michiru are more elemental forces in human form.

The villains are taken from various seasons of Sailor
Moon and are in no particular order. I do wish I had
been able to work in the Starlights somewhere, but no
dice. I did enjoy killing Chibi-moon off early on, and
I&#39;ve gotten a lot of favorable response to Mamoru&#39;s
death. The only character I wish I could have
developed more is Hotaru, but I may do a sequel on her
and Minako. We&#39;ll see....</pre>
