<h1>Life Just Gets Better (part 10 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/lifebet-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>&#147; Do you think you can beat me? I doubt even this form can hurt me!&#148;

&#147; Maybe, maybe not.&#148; Dradian shot a blast at her. She merely side 
stepped it. Terrestrial shot and he side stepped.

They fought like this for twenty minutes. Dradian was perfectly fine. 
Terrestrial had taken almost every shot. His last blast sent her 
flying to the ground. She landed in a heap of rubble. The others came 
running onto untouched grass in the valley where they were fighting. 
Terri was bleeding extensively and had many deep cuts. She stood up 
with her brothers help.

&#147; Let us help to fight. You can&#146;t beat him yourself!&#148; Sailor Moon went 
to her other side, trying to drive sense into the other girls head. 

&#147; No! I can beat him myself. I hate to say it, but even together you 
can&#146;t beat him. Only me.&#148; Darien looked at her oddly. Then 
comprehension showed on his face. Carefully Terri walked over to Rei. 
Smiling and putting a now ungloved hand on her face. 

&#147; Rei your sign will be on my door too.&#148; Mars was confused, along with 
everyone else. Except Darien, who was saying she couldn&#146;t do 
something. Terri walked past them and Darien grabbed her arm.

&#147; No Terrestria&#133;.you could die!&#148; 

&#147; I&#146;ll die if I don&#146;t! If I don&#146;t do this you will also die. Let go 
before I make you.&#148; Her voice was hard and stern. He let go. She 
walked a small distance and stopped. Calling for her stone, she threw 
it like a card. At the sound of &#147;Destiny Universe&#148; the stone spun in 
place. Turning into a black ten-point star. One side flat the other 
slightly rounded. A blinding white light shined on her. White orbs 
surrounded her body then attacked. The orbs turned black and detached. 
There stood yet another sailor.

&#147; Who is that?&#148; Neptune was the one to speak. 

&#147; In Senshi form her name is Sailor Destiny. As Goddess&#133;well she is 
*the* Goddess Gia. Or more like her daughter. My sister&#146;s final 
form&#133;one that could kill her.&#148; Darien looked away as she flew upward. 
Coming to eye level, Sailor Destiny&#146;s face was void of emotion. 
Dradian had a small amount of fear in his eyes.

&#147; Princess, ready to fight me again? You shall die slowly this time.&#148;

&#147; Shut it Dradian. My name is Sailor Destiny and you&#146;ll lose quickly.&#148; 
Destiny&#146;s voice was cool &amp; confident. Her hand up and one finger 
pointing, her attack was shouted. &#147; Destiny Needle&#148; a light shot from 
the finger extended and into Dradian. Who obviously didn&#146;t feel it. 
The Sailor just hovered there.

&#147; That&#146;s it? That&#146;s all that&#146;s in the great daughter of Gia? You have 
los&#133;.&#148; The word &#146;lost&#146; hung on his lip as he screamed bloody murder. 
Skin was being pushed up like needles were under it. White light 
finally sprung through as it tore him apart. Blood and debris burning 
up quickly. The same light flashed around Gia&#146;s daughter and floating 
downward was a very ragged Terrestrial. Darien ran and she was floated 
into his strong arms. Ami checked her pulse.

&#147; We have to get back NOW!!!&#148; and they were gone.

A/N: Soooo is our beloved Terri dead? Maybe, maybe not. I&#146;m ensuring 
anything. You now how it goes, the sister never lives cuz she might 
mess up the future. </pre>
