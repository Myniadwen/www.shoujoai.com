<h1>Angel of Venus (part 6 of 8)</h1>

<a href="../smoon/angelvenus-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Running. The sensation of feeling, fleeting memories etched into being. 
She couldn&#39;t breathe, she gasped, pulled away from the inky, unknown 
blackness. Coughing, trying to regain her bearings, and then scrambling 
up onto a precipice, overlooking the night below. She watched the city, 
silently. She waited. In the distance, there was a church, abandoned and 
cold, a lone, stone angel watching over the lost souls within. She moved 
toward it, and was repelled. Sounds of an otherworldly choir drifted 
against the wind, she shivered.

Then, a violent rush of energy made her topple backwards, she fell off 
the crag, her head hit the side with a sickening thud, and blood made 
its way into her mouth. She was falling, falling into an endless sea of 
shadows...

Somewhere, she heard familiar laughter. The choir continued.

And then, nothing.

Mitsuki woke up with a start. She struggled out of her covers, coughed 
and wiped cold sweat from her brow.

&quot;What was that?&quot; she whispered in the still night. Usagi&#39;s gentle snores 
and the soft, melodic purrs from Luna was all she received in return. 
She turned over, pulled her pillow close to her, and tried to get back 
to sleep.

Then the alarm clock rang. She groaned and dragged herself to the 
bathroom.

------------------------------

&quot;So, I had the best dream last night! There was candy everywhere, and 
the trees were made out of cookies, and the rivers were ice cream and 
soda...oh man, it was great.&quot; Usagi spared a look at Mitsuki and 
frowned. &quot;You don&#39;t look like you slept well at all,&quot; she murmured 
concernedly.

&quot;I didn&#39;t,&quot; Mitsuki muttered sullenly, picking at her sandwich. &quot;I had a 
terrible dream. And when I tried to go back to sleep, the alarm clock 
rang.&quot; She slumped her shoulders and leaned against the tree they were 
sitting under. She yawned. &quot;Where are the others?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ll be here in a minute,&quot; Usagi said, seeing a familiar blue head 
of hair behind a book walking toward them. &quot;Why don&#39;t you try to get 
some rest?&quot; She didn&#39;t have to tell Mitsuki that however, as the girl 
had already drifted to sleep. Usagi patted her hand and waved Ami over. 
The blue haired girl looked up from her book, smiled and made her way 
toward them. She glanced briefly at Mitsuki and laughed softly to 
herself.

&quot;She didn&#39;t get much sleep?&quot;

&quot;Nope.&quot; Usagi shrugged her shoulders. &quot;She had a nightmare.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s terrible. Did she tell you what it was about?&quot;

&quot;Nope...she fell asleep too fast for me to ask.&quot; Usagi laughed. &quot;Well,&quot; 
Ami frowned. &quot;I did look around for some information on her.&quot;

Usagi sweatdropped. &quot;Ummm...how?&quot;

&quot;Well...I used my mini-computer and tried to match her energy patterns 
to anything we&#39;ve fought or encountered so far. There&#39;s nothing even 
relatively close...but...&quot;

&quot;But what?&quot;

&quot;But I did get some odd readings while I was trying to figure some 
things out. Something popped up on my computer, and I tried to open my 
visor to translate it, but nothing much happened. It seems to be in some 
sort of foreign language, or a code of some sort.&quot;

&quot;Wow. A secret language! I wonder if Mitsuki knows what it is. I mean, 
she might, right?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s worth a shot,&quot; Ami said.

------------------------------

Mitsuki frowned. She squinted her eyes, then frowned again.

&quot;I think it&#39;s Sirenid. But I...er...I never really paid much attention 
in my foreign language classes.&quot; She scratched her head; the others 
groaned.

&quot;Do you at least have an idea of what it says?&quot; Rei asked. Mitsuki 
stared at the words on the screen, squinted again.

&quot;Um. Something that looks like, &#39;Hello.&#39; Err...&#39;Hello, I am...a...&#39; I 
don&#39;t know that other word.&quot;

&quot;Way to go,&quot; Rei muttered. Usagi pouted.

&quot;Don&#39;t be mean, Rei. It&#39;s not her fault. Ummm. Ooo, ooo, I know! Ami, 
does it look anything like any languages here?&quot; Ami blinked in surprise, 
as did the others.

&quot;That&#39;s very...smart, Usagi.&quot; The girl beamed proudly, and Ami clicked a 
few buttons on the device. &quot;But I&#39;m afraid not. Though...Mitsuki, do you 
know anyone who might have the technology to send a message on my 
mini-computer? I mean, not many people know of it, so the person that 
did this has to be, well, some sort of genius.&quot;

Mitsuki glanced up. &quot;I know exactly who.&quot;

------------------------------

&quot;Bang bang boom! Wooot! Fear my strength, pathetic web scum! I am the 
greatest, the most magnificent! Yeah! I won, I won!&quot; The girl leaned 
back against a strange, metallic chair, her glasses were askew, her hair 
tousled, but she looked pleased. &quot;Nobody&#39;s a match for me.&quot;

A young man with long, white-blue hair scowled at the controller in his 
hands. He seemed to frown all the time, and his light blue eyes 
contrasted with his tanned skin. &quot;You are the victor, once again Nioko.&quot; 
He gave the tiny girl a slight smile. &quot;How did you think of this game? 
It&#39;s quite good.&quot;

&quot;Wellll...it&#39;s all a matter of concocting a correct strategy game. The 
market nowadays doesn&#39;t know how to appeal to a wide range of gamers, so 
I have to make my own games. Anyways, what are you doing here, 
Suejirou?&quot;

&quot;Er, well. Did you send the message? I mean, I know you&#39;re smart and 
all, but...&quot;

&quot;Ahem. You doubt me, fine sir?&quot; The brown-skinned girl frowned and 
pouted cutely, slipping a pair of goggles over her face. &quot;I sent it. 
But...I might have to send it again.&quot; Blue eyes flickered, and she 
brushed her hair back into a messy bun. &quot;I forgot they might not know my 
language.&quot;

&quot;So it&#39;s a warning,&quot; Suejirou muttered. &quot;Right? They have to be ready 
Nioko, remember.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I remember. No worries, right? It&#39;s fine, it&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll try to 
translate my message into their language, and I&#39;ll send it again.&quot; She 
yawned. &quot;Geez, you worry too much.&quot;

&quot;Err, Nioko?&quot;

&quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;Do you...know their language?&quot;

Nioko looked down at her computer. Then she groaned.

------------------------------

&quot;Nioko is her name. She is an...agent of sorts for the Siren army. She&#39;s 
only about our age, but her knowledge of technology is almost infinite. 
She is...the best friend of the princess Nami. She&#39;s the only one that 
could have sent you that message.&quot;

&quot;Wow. All the way from your planet?&quot; Usagi asked.

&quot;That&#39;s right. Maybe she&#39;s asking for help...&quot; She remembered her dream 
and shivered. &quot;I think something bad is going to happen.&quot;

------------------------------

&quot;So, Nioko sent the warning.&quot;

&quot;Without my consent.&quot;

Kazuki sighed in exasperation. &quot;The girl is simply worried. You can&#39;t 
expect her to sit around and wait for something terrible to happen. It 
isn&#39;t in her nature, and besides...what if it is too large for them to 
handle? Telling them to seek refuge might be the best course of action.&quot;

&quot;That is the problem. They won&#39;t run away. Besides, for now, it has to 
be a secret, something unknown. They&#39;ll have to figure it out on their 
own. Tell Nioko to cancel the translation.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve become awfully silly. What if they don&#39;t figure it out?&quot;

&quot;They will. Have faith.&quot;

&quot;Why do you want them to figure it out on their own?&quot;

&quot;I just...it&#39;s something that might be...hard to understand. If we rush 
in without telling them, or if they find out so abruptly, it might...it 
might bring more harm than help. We...have to let them choose.&quot;

Kazuki sighed and shrugged. &quot;Very well.&quot; </pre>
