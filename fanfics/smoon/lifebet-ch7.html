<h1>Life Just Gets Better (part 7 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/lifebet-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>- My Terri? Where the hell did that come from? I&#146;m in love with 
Serena, Terri&#146;s just my friend. - Rei thought about this as she swept 
the pathways of the Temple. She had to admit, ever since Terri&#146;s 
arrival she really hadn&#146;t thought about Serena. 

- I wonder what Darien would say if he knew I was falling for his 
sister. He doesn&#146;t mind the other girls relationships, but this is his 
*little* sister. Great Rei, just great. You&#146;ll fall in love and she&#146;ll 
probably marry pretty boy Jayton. I know how much Darien likes him. He 
wouldn&#146;t be exactly pissed if they got married.- Rei sighed. Terri 
said life would get better. Is this what she meant?

Suddenly all the Senshi were in front of her. Rei then felt the 
negative vibes. 

&#147; Rei! Get down!&#148; Sailor Terrestrial dove forward and pushed Rei out 
of the way. A black arrow piercing where she once stood. Rei snapped 
her head back up when she heard her savior scream. There in 
Terrestrials right ankle was another black arrow. Rei quickly 
transformed. By that time a black rock had started covering the young 
Princess. Lord Dradian then appeared.

&#147; Princess, did you think you could escape me? You can&#146;t get out of 
that stone my dear. The one thing that renders you helpless!&#148; Dradian 
started laughing at their horrified faces. Mars knew she could only 
watch as the rock quickly covered her friend. Before it covered her 
head, Terrestrial told Mars something only she could here: &#147; You&#146;ll 
know what to do.&#148; Then the rock holding the Planet Senshi disappeared.

A/N: So what&#146;s gonna happen? You can guess or read the next chapter! 
I&#146;d prefer you choose the latter. I know clich&eacute; right? Sorry but this 
is how it goes I guess! </pre>
