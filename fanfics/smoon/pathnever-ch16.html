<p><u>Come  Night, Michiru’s house (kitchen) , Haruka’s POV</u></p>
<p>“What’s  the word?” I asked, still feeling numb. Physically I was fine but  my mind was another story.</p>
<p>Michi shook her head. “I phoned  everyone and no one has seen her. Rei is particularly worried; Usagi  said she is having a hard time keeping the poor girl under  control.”</p>
<p>It’s no wonder… you can’t blame her. While  those two lived together all this time they’ve must’ve become  pretty close friends. Perhaps sisters even.</p>
<p><em>‘Why! Why did  you leave?’</em></p>
<p>“What…do you think she meant when she  said <em>that</em>?” Michi softly whispered. Apparently the two of us  were thinking the same thing.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I have no  clue to be honest. All I do know, is that she was upset and it had  something to do with us.”</p>
<p>Perhaps…she was in a state of  shock and it sent her over the edge. It was possible wasn’t it? I  was afraid of what I saw in her eyes. There was hatred… such deep  hatred and somehow I knew I had something to do with it…Although  it’s not uncommon for some people to hate me, what I felt was  crazy. It was almost like…killer intent…But it didn’t explain  why she hit Michi. I’ve never known anyone to lay a finger on my  partner ever since we’ve left our hometown…And then seeing our  best friend hit her in the face, it was like the world had gone  crazy!</p>
<p>“Is it still stinging?” I asked Michi.</p>
<p>She  nodded but her hands wouldn’t go of the phone.</p>
<p>The other  woman was deadly quiet since we’ve came back. You know she’s  worrying like crazy but too lady-like to show it. It’s  stupid!</p>
<p>“Michi…” I walked over to the woman, embracing  her from behind. “Michi, let go.” I carefully pried her hands  away from the cold plastic. She was very reluctant to let go, even by  my coaxing.</p>
<p>For a few minutes we stood there, not wanting to  move. All I could hear was her soft, short breaths as they began to  waver. Instantly I knew she was on the verge of tears and the sobs  would soon follow.</p>
<p>“Why…does she hate us?”</p>
<p>Hate…was  such a powerful word. But it was stronger in emotion. Michi, being  particularly strong to sensing emotions and auras through her sixth  sense was especially vulnerable to such emotions. If I feel bad,  imagine how she must feel.</p>
<p>What can I do? What can I do to  make her feel better?</p>
<p>“It’s late…we should get some  sleep.”</p>
<p>Michi shook her head but I knew she was  exhausted.</p>
<p>“Please? I don’t want to lose you  too.”</p>
<p>She slowly turned around, her eyes  looking somewhat bloodshot. She’d been crying a lot…The look in  her eyes however was questioning. We stood there gazing at each  other, wondering who should make the first move. In truth I was  scared. What she needed, I wasn’t so sure I could provide.</p>
<p>“Michi,  you know I’m not a man and I’ve never done any of this.” I  wanted to her to be sure of her decision. If she wanted to back out  now, then…I’d let her. I won’t be around much longer but I want  to help her in any way I can now. “And we can’t have children of  our own…” I knew it was once her dream to have a family. But I  can’t give her that…If I could, I would.</p>
<p>There was a  strange glint in her eyes as I finished. She didn’t seem bothered  by my statement at all; I thought that she might’ve forgotten about  that little complication.</p>
<p>“I…” The rest of my words were  drowned out when her lips pressed against mine. It had taken me by  surprise. When we parted, all I could stutter was, “A-Are you  sure?” Without answering in words, I felt her take my hand and lead  me upstairs to our bedroom.</p>
<p><u>Upstairs</u></p>
<p><u></u>Still  feeling uncertain, I watched as the mysterious beauty climbed onto  the bed. All I could think was how amazing she was, my every reason  for loving her. Kind, understanding, graceful, polite, hard-working,  patient, talented and beautiful. I began to feel insignificant again  as these thoughts began to swarm my mind. Not good enough?  Definitely…</p>
<p><em>‘Who should be the one to decide that? It’s  Michiru’s choice, not yours’</em></p>
<p>Kaiya…</p>
<p>Michi  faced me, looking at me if only for a moment before she motioned me  over. My legs moved on their own, taking one step after another until  I was sitting on the mattress. I could feel my heart racing inside as  Michi lay back, waiting for me. She was just…so beautiful.</p>
<p>Slowly I lowered myself until I lay directly on top of her.  When I closed my eyes I could hear both of our hearts. They were both  racing in our chests until they sounded as one beat. As I felt her  arms encircle my back, pressing me harder against her, I thought, ‘If  only for one night, then I can die with no regrets.’</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s  POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>I don’t…want to lose anyone else. However  life can be cruel and unpredictable. One of my hands came up and  cupped my partner’s cheek. I want to show her, tell her my feelings  so whatever may happen in the future, she will always have this one  night to remember.</p>
<p>“It’s all right.” I whispered into  her ear.</p>
<p>Ruka’s mouth found mine. It was a soft, gentle  kiss. However in a matter of seconds, I felt Ruka’s passion  increase to hungry proportions and in turn, my own had rose to meet  it.</p>
<p>I then felt her mouth on my neck, kissing its way  downward. It wasn’t the only place I felt her; suddenly felt her  everywhere; hands exploring as then went south. Involuntarily my body  began to move on it’s own.</p>
<p>“Ru…ka. Ah!” I let out a  small gasp.</p>
<p>I became lost, desire clouding my mind. There  were so many sensations that I could not focus on one alone. It felt  impossible. My hands tugged at her hair.</p>
<p>…I love her so much  that it sometimes hurts. When she told me that she was not a man and  that she could not give me children I felt at a loss of what to say.  None of that matters…What matters is here and now, myself being  with Ruka.</p>
<p>It felt like eternity of pure bless when I could  not longer bare it any longer. I was vaguely aware that I was  screaming out Ruka’s name or that my muscles had locked. It felt  like I was in the clouds.</p>
<p>As soon as I came down, the only  words that left my lips were, “I love you.”</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s  POV, some time later</u></p>
<p><u></u>I lay on looking at my partner  who had finally fallen asleep. Her breathing tickled my chest but I  felt no urge to move anytime soon.</p>
<p>Still unable to sleep, my  eyes wandered to the far wall, watching the moonlight come in and out  of hiding. For awhile I heard nothing but my ears would not stop  listening. It was as if I was listening for something, expecting  something to happen. Why? I can’t say. A feeling of déjà  vu hovered over me.</p>
<p>My head suddenly throbbed, causing me to  flinch.</p>
<p>“Ah…” I hissed, trying not to wake Michi.</p>
<p>One  of my hands came up to my head as I tried to massage the pained area  but it didn’t help. Damn…I hope I don’t need to go get  tylenol...</p>
<p><strong><em>Brrriiiiiiiiiing.  Brrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Hm? The phone? But who could  be calling at this time of night? I gave a small gasp; maybe…it was  one of the scouts, perhaps they’ve found Kaiya.</p>
<p>I carefully  left the bed, giving extra caution as I tiptoed out not to make a  noise.</p>
<p><strong>Tup, tup, tup, tup, tup.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Brrrriiiiiiiing.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I  was about to pick it up my hand automatically retracted as though the  machine was a poisonous snake waiting to bite. Why did I do that? I  looked at my own hand. While feeling confused and wondering what had  happened, I missed my chance to speak in person to the caller.</p>
<p>The  answering machine light came on and I waited with a hushed  breath.</p>
<p><em>“Tenoh Haruka…or should I say Sailor Uranus? I  have a message for you.”</em></p>
<p>That didn’t sound like any  of the girls. I narrowed my eyes when my mind finally registered the  voice; it was the Death Buster from earlier today. What’s could her  damn message be if it was important enough to call me in the middle  of the night? I had a good mind to rip out the telephone cord and  chuck this thing across the room.</p>
<p><em>“I’ve got the kid.”</em></p>
<p>WHAT? Now she had my attention; was she talking about  Kaiya?</p>
<p><em>“And she’s a real pain in the ass. Unless you  come to these directions, she’s history. Got it?”</em> The fax  machine began to shoot out a piece of paper. Tentatively with great  disgust I picked the paper up and found the simple road directions.  And…I traced the red line, it all lead to the huge red circle in  its center, the Marine Cathedral.</p>
<p>Way out there? Figures…</p>
<p><em>“Be  there. TONIGHT.”</em> She stressed the last word in a menacing tone.  I got the hint. “Within two hours or-”</p>
<p><strong>Blep.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Did  she…just get cut off? Given the time to think I couldn’t help but  conclude this was all a trap. I know it is; you can’t trust any  enemy that wants to destroy the world. But what other choice do I  have? She might be bluffing about having Kaiya captured but the odds  are against me; no one has seen her since that incident today. Would  I want to risk skipping out?</p>
<p><strong><em>Brrrrriiiiiiiing.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I  waited again, knowing who it was instantly.</p>
<p>“<em>Stupid  machine cut me off!</em>” She growled. “<em>Now as I was saying,  the kid won’t be the only one who gets it, but the others as well.  NOW I’m done</em>.”</p>
<p><strong>Blep.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Others…? If the  Death Busters have the other talisman holders, then I can’t refuse,  whatever the circumstance may be.</p>
<p>It’s…really time…</p>
<p>I  slowly walked up the steps to where Michi was sleeping to say my  goodbye. The woman was still sleeping peacefully. Relief filled me  for that quick moment seeing her looking so relaxed. She looked  happy. Perhaps a good dream?</p>
<p>With one hand I lightly touched  her aqua locks, memorizing the feel with what I saw. This is what I  want to remember when I’m fighting, when I die.</p>
<p><em>‘If  one of us falls, the other must continue the mission’</em></p>
<p>That  was our promise wasn’t it? Even before we found this love…I guess  this means you’ll have to continue on.</p>
<p>My eyes scanned the  room for a piece of paper and pen. There’s no way I can tell her  now…but I can leave her a note and the message on the answering  machines downstairs.</p>
<p>One hour…she needs to be up in one  hour to make it in time to regain the crystals if need be. I can try  to hold off on my own until then.</p>
<p>I set the alarm clock.</p>
<p>Now  all that was left…</p>
<p>“I love you.” I whispered, the words  coming easily now; it may be my last chance to ever say it. “Be  strong.”</p>
<p>I gave her a peck on the forehead and then made my  leave.</p>
<p><strong>Tup…tup…tup…tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong><u><br />
</u></strong><u>Kaiya’s  POV,School garden</u></p>
<p><u></u>I could never see it…Why  was I so blind? I brought my knees up to my chest, hugging them  tightly against the cool night. My eyes centered upon a small crack  in the brickwork. I’ve finally came here, not knowing where else to  go; I couldn’t go back to the shrine anymore and I certainly can’t  go back to Haruka and Michiru…even if they are my parents, I  thought sarcastically.</p>
<p>The image of hitting Neptune flashed  through my mind’s eye. Despite all my good for nothing hatred, I  couldn’t help but feel a twinge of guilt.</p>
<p>I hope she’s  okay…</p>
<p>I looked up at the sky and blinked, noticing the dark  clouds. It was still pretty, even if it was dark…I soon became  mesmerized with the moon; it was so bright, I couldn’t believe how  it could shine like that despite those clouds.</p>
<p>Hm?</p>
<p>What’s…that?</p>
<p>A small pink spot had  appeared in the sky. No, wait! It was glowing! I immediately was on  my feet, wondering whether to hide or to prepare for a fight. It was  a time portal; I recognized it because it was the exact way that I  came here! But who could it be? I doubt it was my sis; with her being  busy as she was…and no one else that I knew possessed the ability  except… My eyes widened and I took a step back. It can’t be…  why would she be here?</p>
<p>A wave of terror hit me; what should I  do? I crossed over without her permission. Her attack had almost  killed me and would have if Hotaru-chan’s power hadn’t shielded  me.</p>
<p>I am stronger now but could I really take on the guardian  of time?</p>
<p><strong>FLAAAAAAAAASH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I covered my eyes as  the light shot down, creating a pillar of light in its wake. Not  surprisingly, its target was in this garden.</p>
<p>“Geh…” I  struggled to keep my eyes open.</p>
<p>“This is where you were  hiding?” The figure stepped out of the light. I noticed the gate  closed immediately after the woman had left its doors.</p>
<p>I took  in the stranger warily, watchful for anything she might pull. The  woman had long green hair that extended past her waist and wore the  traditional Sailor Senshi fuku (like all, it was merely a different  color than the other scouts; it looked black and white) Crimson eyes  bore down on me but I felt no intense hatred. The feeling she emitted  was a strong sense of ‘duty’ and perhaps…loneliness? It was  intense! I almost choked back. Instinctively I narrowed my eyes,  trying to get a better view. Inside I saw the void. It was a mass of  nothingness swirling around a pink glowing sphere of light. Could  that be her heart?</p>
<p>“That is enough.” She gripped her  garnet rod tighter. The weapon startled me for a second; I wonder  what kind of power it contained?</p>
<p>In response I raised an  eyebrow.</p>
<p>“I know about your natural abilities; your mother  has it too, the sixth sense. Although…she was not quite so willing  to probe in a fellow scout’s spirit.”</p>
<p>I opened my mouth  but immediately closed it. Why the hell was I about to say ‘sorry’?  What…did she want with me anyway? I was sure it her visit had a lot  more to do than scolding me about the use of my powers.</p>
<p>“To  the heart of the matter, I have come to tell you to return home.”</p>
<p>Go  home!</p>
<p>“As we both know, you do not belong here. Your  presence will only serve to increase the alteration of time.”</p>
<p>“Is  that all?” I spoke up, finally saying something to the stranger. It  wasn’t that anyone cared about me after all, this person was only  here to do her duty.</p>
<p>It…made me angry.</p>
<p>She closed  her eyes for a moment before opening them again. “Your ‘sister’,  Hotaru is having difficulty managing the other planet rulers in your  absence. It is causing a potential problem. That is why you must  return.”</p>
<p>“What would they want with me?”</p>
<p>“…It  is the issue concerning all of the heirs…” I waited for her to  continue. “However, I cannot say more than that.”</p>
<p>This  irritated me. I suppose she’s hoping I’ll die from curiosity and  go back.</p>
<p>“…” She remained silent but something seemed  amiss. I looked her up and down, all my senses on the  alert.</p>
<p>“You…didn’t come straight here did you?” There  were other time traces still emitting from her body. Each place in  time produced different particles, a different feel you might say. I  didn’t notice it so much until now; normally you don’t sense them  because they’re so small. However the various time chips on her  were in massive concentrations! Guess that’s what you get for being  the guardian of time.</p>
<p>“…” She didn’t move. I was  starting to catch onto this woman’s mannerisms from that little  peak earlier. That basically meant, ‘yes’ but I won’t tell  you.</p>
<p>“Who did you see? The inner scouts? Or perhaps my  parents?” Yes, doesn’t everyone want to see my parents these  days? The thoughts brought up another feeling of bitter sarcasm.</p>
<p>“…It is against my better judgement, but I will give you  a choice; you do not seem too keen on staying here do you, not since  that incident?” The comment had hit home, reviving the hurt. “I  have visited the other senshi as you said.” She watched me  carefully, but did not seem the least bit alarmed by the buttons she  was pushing. “They are not at home.” She continued, correctly  reading my plan of action to contact them.</p>
<p>“What…do you  mean?”</p>
<p>“As we speak, they are all gathering at the Marine  Cathedral. I too, will meet them there accordingly.”</p>
<p>“When  you mean by everyone…”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>“I  am strongly suggesting that you return from where you came from…If  you choose to join us at the Marine Cathedral…then I will have no  choice but to force you to return home.”</p>
<p>So…what she’s  saying is that she’s willing to let me leave and keep my pride  intact…or choose to try and rebel against her then get my ass  kicked.</p>
<p>“Here.” She tossed me a tiny object and I caught  it with both hands. Before I opened my palms to see what she had  given me, I knew by its feel that it was a time key. “I trust you  will make the right decision.”</p>
<p>“Wait! Tell me…Haruka has  the space sword talisman, so does that mean Michiru…?”</p>
<p>“…”  She looked at me for a second but then turned to go, not willing to  give any more explanation.</p>
<p>I didn’t move as the time senshi  walks out of the garden into another pillar of light. I just couldn’t  stop looking at the key. Either way I choose Pluto will send me home  won’t she?</p>
<p>What…should I do? If the talisman conclusion is  tonight, then…</p>
<p><em>‘They’ll die.’</em></p>
<p><br />
  <u>Michiru’s  POV, her house</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Ruka…where did you go?” I jolted  awake as the dream ended. It was that dream again…Every time I was  searching for her but I could not find her…it scared me; Ruka won’t  really disappear on me would she? My hand reached out beside me to  assure myself that my fears were falsely based.</p>
<p>“Ruka?”<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I  froze, unable to feel my partner’s presence.</p>
<p>I attempted to  sense her aura in the darkness but she was not there. What was…?  With worry I immediately left the bed and made way downstairs, hoping  she was down there.</p>
<p>However when I reached the bottom of the  steps and saw no light on and that little bit of hope drained quickly  drained away.</p>
<p>“She’s…not  here…”</p>
<p>Hm? We have a message? I peered at the answering  machine, seeing the red light flash. Perhaps this has something to do  with Ruka’s disappearance?</p>
<p>I clicked the button. At first  there was static but the message came loud and clear in a matter of  seconds.</p>
<p><em>“Tenoh Haruka…or should I say Sailor Uranus? I  have a message for you.”</em></p>
<p>The Death Buster?</p>
<p><em>“I’ve  got the kid. And she’s a real pain in the ass. Unless you come to  these directions, she’s history. Got it?”</em></p>
<p>My legs  nearly gave out on me, bringing me to grasp the nearby wall for  support. So that’s why…That’s why…I was on the verge of tears  again as these whirlwind of emotions embraced me. Why didn’t you  tell me…?</p>
<p>…I…may lose them both…</p>
<p>The thought  was nearly unbearable. I realized my throat felt dry and proceeded to  the sink for a glass of water when I noticed a notepad on the  counter. I knew I didn’t leave it there…Slowly I brought the  object closer to my eyes where I could read its writing.</p>
<p>It  was not what I had expected; instead of a long letter of any sort it  was a map. I instantly recognized Ruka’s style of artistry. Looking  it over, I found that the site was…</p>
<p>“The Marine  Cathedral.”</p>
<p>And under the paper’s contents lay one simple  message.</p>
<p><em>‘If one of us falls, the other must continue the  mission. Be strong.’</em></p>
<p>She plans on dying!</p>
<p>I  quickly headed for the door, not caring about anything other than  saving my partner and friend. I cannot sit back and let these things  happen, especially since I have the power that can affect the  outcome.</p>
<p>Please wait for me…</p>
<p><strong>Slam.</strong></p>
<p><u>Haruka’s  POV, Marine Cathedral</u></p>
<p><u></u>I glanced up and down the  entranceway. Its doors were massive, making me feel small. The dark  clouds continued to pass by overhead, reminding me of my last good  bye. Her face still stayed in my mind, not willing to leave. It was  peaceful…giving me a sense of peace as well. Unconsciously I  straightened my poster, bringing myself up to meet the challenge at  hand.</p>
<p>It’s up to me…Hang in there Kaiya, I’m  coming.</p>
<p>With no more hesitation I pushed against the heavy  doors, forcing them open by my will. They creaked, opening small bits  at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Creeeeaaaaaaaaak.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I stepped forward  into the seemingly dark room, noticing how the doors closed as soon  as I entered. Determined not to panic, I watched the solid barrier  for an extra few seconds to be sure that there would be no rear end  attack. Once I was ready, I set my sights on the corridor ahead. My  eyes took another minute to completely adjust.</p>
<p>Doesn’t seem  to be much does it?</p>
<p>It had the appearance of any other  church. Peeves lined both sides of the entrance, a red carpet down  the corridor’s middle and the classic stain glass windows above.  Most of the light in fact came through the windows, in streams of  rainbow colors. The place was probably abandoned for awhile if they  couldn’t afford decent lighting.</p>
<p><strong>Tup. Tup.  Tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Cautiously I tread forward, watching for any side  attacks. I learned long ago that anything can happen. Unexpected  things…both good and bad. However, if you have your guard down  it’ll just hit you harder and in turn, knock your world upside down  (if you’re still alive that is).</p>
<p>Now at the other end of  the room I concluded that this was the safe zone; the enemy most  likely is holed up deep inside where it would be harder to  escape.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>On the altar was a bouquet of red  roses. They were the liveliest looking things in this entire place  that I’ve seen so far. I couldn’t help but reach out to touch it.  It was real wasn’t it? The soft petals affirmed my suspicions.  But…what was it doing here? I searched the flowers, hoping to find  a clue. It didn’t seem right that these were here for decoration;  they were too fresh. Someone had planted it here, I was sure of it.</p>
<p>I found nothing in the bouquet but rather, under it. Carved  into the rotting wood was, ‘take a rose for your own grave’.</p>
<p>Cute…</p>
<p>“Heh, I’ll play your game.” I smirked,  taking a rose.</p>
<p>No regrets…I exited the room and entered the  next.</p>
<p><u>Cross Roads</u></p>
<p><u></u>I stared, looking  onwards with confusion. Instead of an another single corridor that I  predicted, there were three different paths.</p>
<p>Shit, what was  this Death Buster thinking!</p>
<p>No sooner had the thought sounded  in my mind, another voice echoed through the room and…bad organ  music. “Welcome to the Eudial games. If you wish to continue  forward then choose a path. You might live but I can’t guarantee  that. But who cares? You’ll die in the end anyway.” She  laughed.</p>
<p>“What’re you planning? What’s the deal with  three paths?”</p>
<p>“…Oh that? I was bored.”</p>
<p>I  growled.</p>
<p>“But don’t worry, you’ll only have to do  one. However, the path will automatically close up after you enter,  so better choose carefully.”</p>
<p>I swear she still sounded too  cheerful!</p>
<p>I turned my attention on the doors again, feeling  the pressure beginning to build. I have no idea what’s behind them,  which would be easier or faster. What a pain… While I’m here  thinking my brains out, who knows what that witch is doing to Kaiya  and the others…</p>
<p>Come on, what’s the big deal? I told  myself. It’s just one path, only one challenge. I’ll die anyway… <em>‘But you want to save them before you do, don’t you?’ </em>A  voice echoed inside.</p>
<p><strong>DOOM.</strong></p>
<p>Still clutching my  rose, I went for the path straight ahead, the middle of the three  diverging pathways. I was always a straightforward person, right  Michi?</p>
<p><strong>Tup. Tup. Tup. Tup.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Main  Hallway</u></p>
<p><u></u>This was different…</p>
<p>It was a  straight hallway but it appeared to have nothing in it. There were no  desks, tables, shelves or anything! But there had to be a catch here;  it looks too easy and I know nothing comes  easy.</p>
<p><strong>Tup…tup…tup…</strong></p>
<p>Still holding my rose  I walked forward, slightly hunched over in case evasive measures were  required. My gaze wandered right to left, eyeing any potential  changes in the environment. An abnormal crack in the tiles, a hollow  footstep would do…or…</p>
<p><strong>SHRUMP.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>…A MOVING  WALL TILE!</p>
<p>“Nng!” I rolled out of its way as it shot  horizontally across the room.</p>
<p>I stayed low, watching the  others for any sign of movement.</p>
<p>“How’d you like that?”  Eudial’s voice echoed again. “Want some more? Just watch that  rose your holding take a plunge!”</p>
<p><strong>Rumble…rumble…rumble…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The  other tiles dislocated from their holdings, somehow floating. A magic  trick? I looked down at my rose, which already looked like it was  molting; a few of the petals had come loose and began to unnaturally  stick to my hand.</p>
<p><strong>Bam!<br />
</strong></p>
<p>A shot had barely  nicked my cheek. I stared ahead at the red tile that had shot it. On  it’s sides were bullet holes and still smoking.</p>
<p>Damn, this  is going to be harder than I thought!</p>
<p>A thorn on the rose  pricked my finger as my hands clamped down. “Ouch! Stupid thing!”  I threw it up into the air as a rain of bullets came.</p>
<p><strong>Bam!  Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>As long as I stay in front  of them and not to their side, they can’t hit me! I kept making  sharp turns and occasional rolls to avoid becoming something like  swiss cheese.</p>
<p>“Ah! Gah! Nng! Hah!”</p>
<p><strong>Tup! Tup!  Tup! Tup!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>My ears suddenly pricked up; did I just hear a  breeze? A strong gust of wind came out of nowhere, sending the  scattered rose petals up into the air in all directions. I watched  dumbfounded as my targets turned and continued to shoot at the  PETALS, not me.</p>
<p>So that’s it!</p>
<p>I dashed forward  into the line of stones. There’s no way I’ll be able to get these  pesky petals off of me in time, but I can…</p>
<p><strong>SMACK!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I  leapt up and over a stone slab, hitting my hand against it and  attaching a gift to it. It’s comrades immediately targeted it as I  dashed away.</p>
<p><strong>Bam!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>One down!</p>
<p><strong>SMACK!  Bam! SMACK! Bam! SMACK! Bam! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! Bam! Bam!  Bam!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The last few were lined up in a straight line, easy  for pickings.</p>
<p>“World…SHAKING!”</p>
<p><strong>WhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiIIIIIRRRR-  KABAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The air was filled with disintegrating dust  particles for a few shorts minutes but it quickly cleared up, as did  my path. I confidently walked forward while continuing to pick off  the sticky petals.</p>
<p>“Hey, can you hear me?” I shouted up  towards the roof. “I’m coming for you!”</p>
<p><strong>Tup. Tup.  Tup. Tup!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Main chapel</u></p>
<p><u></u>The  ‘musician’ stopped her playing and spun around on the seat.  “Looks like you’ve finally arrived. Alive…” She made a small  frown. “But that can be easily remedied.”</p>
<p>“Just try  it!” I charged forward.</p>
<p>She whipped out a new gun of hers.  I watched her trigger finger, ready to dodge right or left when it  fires.</p>
<p><strong>Click.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>WHAT?</p>
<p><strong>Bam! Bam!<br />
  Bam!  Bam!<br />
  Bam! Bam!<br />
  Bam! Bam!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I fell to my knees,  wondering what the hell had just happened. The gun didn’t fire…To  my sides I saw the similar tiles I had only beaten in the last room,  only these ones weren’t dust particles.</p>
<p>“Remote control.”  The Death Buster explained. She pointed to the false gun and smiled.  “Feeling a bit numb? Those shots can do that to you.”</p>
<p>S-Shit…The  numbness began to spread.</p>
<p>“Where’s the girl?” I shouted.  Already the sinking feeling had begun to sink in; there was no one  else in this room other than the Death Buster and myself.</p>
<p>“There  was no girl. And now…you’re the bait.” She turned towards a  monitor screen. “Oh what do ya know? Right on time.”</p>
<p>I  saw the figure approach the Cathedral’s entrance.</p>
<p>“Neptune!”  I cried out. What was she doing here so early?</p>
<p><strong>Cha-chink.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I  froze.</p>
<p>“This is the real gun.”</p>
<p>My mind raced. If  Michi sees me as a hostage who knows how she’ll react! She might  not attack. The thought re-ignited my rage, fueling a burning flame  within me. THERE’S NO WAY I’LL BE USED AS BAIT!</p>
<p>“So if  you’ll cooperat- H-Hey! What are you doing?”</p>
<p>I staggered  up, still feeling the effect of the last attack. “…Just shoot the  damn gun already…”</p>
<p>“Huh!”</p>
<p>“World…”</p>
<p>“Yaaaaaah!” <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“SHAKING!”</p>
<p><strong>SHHHHHRRRRSH-<br />
  WhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiirrrrrrRR-</strong></p>
<p><strong>CRASH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Kaiya’s  POV, Park</u></p>
<p><u></u>To go or to stay? I had been debating this  for the last half-hour, deciding what I should do. Either path seemed  to lead to a no win situation for me. And to be honest, I was not  attracted by either prospect. Why would I want to save my parents  now? It was my goal to come here and kill them. But…there were  unseen complications that I hadn’t expected. My closest friends I  made in this time were the people I wanted to kill. It was as though  my life was one big, cruel joke.</p>
<p>… If I stayed, would I  really be able to go through with it now?</p>
<p>On the other hand, I  was curious as to what Pluto meant when things were getting rocky at  home. If sis was having trouble…</p>
<p><em>‘…It is the issue  concerning all of the heirs…’</em></p>
<p>Sounds pretty big,  whatever it is. If what she said was true, then it’s my presence  they are requiring; if I look at it in a twisted way then I suppose  they do want me back home.</p>
<p>“Guess I should go…”</p>
<p>The  key began to glow and I felt myself being engulf in the pink  light.</p>
<p><strong>Flaaaaash.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Neptune’s POV, Cross  Roads</u></p>
<p><u></u>I loosely held the rose that I had taken from  the altar. If it is anyone’s grave that this will be for, it will  be the Death Buster’s! They are responsible for all this... I swear  in the name of Neptune that I will find Uranus and Kaiya, and bring  them back!</p>
<p>With my resolve strengthened I analyzed the  options open to me.</p>
<p>The middle path is sealed off…Uranus  must have entered through that path… Which leaves me with two  alternative choices. Right…or left? Both sides are radiating  negative energy… However, the one of the left appears to be calm in  comparison to the right pathway; from my sixth sense, I’m getting  pulsing vibrations as if the energy itself was living.</p>
<p>All  right, left it is then.</p>
<p>With my rose in hand, I entered the  left well aware the pathway was closing behind  me.</p>
<p><strong>Rumble…rumble…rumble….wham.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>The  Fountain Room</u></p>
<p><u></u>I stumbled forward into a pitch-dark  room. Vaguely I knew my position but that became much more  compromising as I explored deeper into the chamber. I could not see  my way, yet I felt it. There weren’t so many objects on the ground  as I had anticipated, easing a certain degree of tension from my  burdened mind. Yet…Why did I hear running water? I bent down and  felt the wet presence. Perhaps this place hadn’t entirely recovered  from the flooding incident awhile back.</p>
<p>Seeing this as a  possible advantage, I stood still and let my power seep out till it  covered the entire area. Inanimate objects may not produce a  particularly strong aura but…</p>
<p>I dropped the rose onto the  ground.</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>The action produced immediately  results; as the water carried the petals around the room I could see  the highlighted pathways light up nearby objects as well. Soon, what  I was looking at was a map of the room in my mind’s eye.</p>
<p>But  where was the doorway out?</p>
<p>Walking with greater confidence  now, I moved ahead until I came to a crack in a wall. There was cool  air coming inside, meaning outside was directly on the other side of  this wall.</p>
<p>Let’s see some  light!</p>
<p>“Deep…SUBMERGE!”</p>
<p><strong>WhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiIIIIRRRRRRR-  BLAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>With a section of the wall now missing, light shot  across to the other side onto a hidden doorway away from the  water.</p>
<p>This must be it…</p>
<p><strong>Tup. Tup. Tup.  Tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong>Creeeeeeak.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Main chapel</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Uranus!”  I arrived in time to see my partner unleash a world shaking. The  enemy had also fired her weapon.</p>
<p>“World…”</p>
<p>“Yaaaaaah!” <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“SHAKING!”</p>
<p><strong>SHHHHHRRRRSH-<br />
  WhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiirrrrrrRR-</strong></p>
<p><strong>CRASH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>My  arms came up to cover my eyes from the clouds of dust. “Uranus,  where are you?” I called out to her.</p>
<p>As the dust cleared I  was shocked at what I saw. In the background the Death Buster’s  monitors had been completely destroyed but what drew my immediately  attention was,</p>
<p>“Uranus…” Above her face down body was a  talisman. A sword shining in all it’s glory.</p>
<p>Why didn’t  she tell me? My knees began to grow weak. Why didn’t she tell  me!</p>
<p>“Great, now you’ve ruined my machine!” The Death  Buster complained as though she had lost a new toy.</p>
<p>My eyes  searched the room, finding no other presence. She lured Ruka here,  taking advantage of her heart. My eyes flashed.</p>
<p>You’ll  pay…</p>
<p>She turned towards me. “Ah, another talisman holder  has arrived.”</p>
<p>I ignored the  words.</p>
<p>“Deep…SUBMERGE!”</p>
<p><strong>WhiiiiiiiiiiiiIIIIIIIRRRRRRRR-  BLAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The organ in the back took the direct blow. Sounds  of flying keys and breaking metal rang in the air.</p>
<p>She’s  fast!</p>
<p>A glint of metal told me her gun was now raised. My  legs bent; readily prepared to dodge to the side.</p>
<p><em>‘It’s  a trick!</em>’</p>
<p>Uranus?</p>
<p>As the gun went off I heard, <em>‘DUCK!’</em></p>
<p><strong>Thud.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bam! Bam!<br />
  Bam!  Bam!<br />
  Bam! Bam!<br />
  Bam! Bam!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>This won’t get me  anywhere. I waited until the firing had stopped and then dashed back  towards the previous room I had been in.</p>
<p>“Where do you think  you’re going!”</p>
<p>To where I have the advantage!</p>
<p><u>Fountain  Room</u></p>
<p><u></u>I waited up in a dark corner, out of the sight  where the light could not reach me. Below me the witch entered with a  rush that she must had forgotten this chamber; she swore crudely at  her lack in vision. I however could still sense the flower  petals.</p>
<p>“…Why don’t you just come out and make it easier  for the both of us?” She snarled.</p>
<p>Silently I watched her  trail inward deeper to the heart of the room. She stationed herself  in front of the room fountain. I could feel her muscles tense,  evidence of the fear she began to harbor.</p>
<p>No pity; she had  unknowingly stumbled into my trap.</p>
<p>I raised one hand, palm  up, and focused a portion of my powers to call the water in the room  to the flower petals. The power to manipulate water…My eyes  narrowed automatically although I could not physically see her.</p>
<p>I  will not play by her game. She will play <em>mine</em>.</p>
<p>I shot  my fingers of the lifted hand upwards, sending columns of water  spiraling upwards. My opponent let out a scream when the invisible  force hit her. She could not move; the water created a cage-like  barrier all around where she stood.</p>
<p>Here was my chance.  “Deep…SUBMERGE!”</p>
<p><strong>WhiiiiiiIIIIRRRRR-  BLAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“GAAAAAAAAAH!”</p>
<p>Once the noise stopped I  dropped my offensive barriers and let myself return to the floor. Her  presence had not faded but it was considerably weakened.</p>
<p>A  voice in my mind told me that I could eliminate this creature if I  chose to do so. However, I knew it would not erase the pain in my  heart or in my dearest friend or lover.</p>
<p>She was not worth  killing.</p>
<p><strong>Tup…tup…tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Kaiya’s  POV, time corridor</u></p>
<p><u></u>I was already halfway through;  using the main path was much more straight forward than trying to  stumble your way through off the path. I thought back to my first  visit here. Being attacked by Pluto wasn’t a fun experience, I  bitterly thought.</p>
<p><strong>Ping!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“What?”</p>
<p>I  stopped and turned towards the noise. It felt like…someone’s life  force had vanished.</p>
<p>So…then it must have started.</p>
<p>The  uneasiness began to erode my decision to go home. It was like  something inside wanted me to desperately go to where the others  were, not where Pluto had told me.</p>
<p>“That’s stupid, why  would I want to stick my neck out for them?”</p>
<p>If I went,  Pluto will surely retaliate; she did say she’d force me to return  home if I didn’t do it myself.</p>
<p><em>‘Do you really believe  what you’re telling yourself?’</em></p>
<p><em>What?</em></p>
<p><em>‘You can  tell yourself whatever lies you want but it won’t change the way  your heart feels!’</em></p>
<p>“Uranus…I won’t let you do this  alone.”</p>
<p>I heard Neptune’s voice echo through the  corridor.</p>
<p>“I can only pray that Rai will be here to guard  and protect our talismans from the Death Busters…” Her voice was  a whisper now.</p>
<p>Michiru!</p>
<p><em>‘Go to them!’</em></p>
<p>I  held up the time key in my palm, hoping that this method would work.  “Take me to the Marine Cathedral!”</p>
<p>It began to ebb and  glow, forming a separate portal in this enormous dark void.  Immediately I stepped into it with a feeling of emergency pushing me  forward with impatience.</p>
<p><u>Cross Road</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Silence  Glaive!”</p>
<p>The purple light left and I found myself in the  new change of clothes. Now dressed as ‘Rai’ I stared ahead at the  three corridors in my way. Each one appeared blocked off, prodding my  current impatient demeanor.</p>
<p>I have no time for  this!</p>
<p>“World….SHAKING!”</p>
<p><strong>WHiiiiiiiiiiIIIIRRRRRRR-KABLAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The  seal to the middle pathway collapsed, leaving me an opening for  intrusion. Quickly I ran forward, not caring what sort of dangers lay  ahead.</p>
<p>I have to hurry!</p>
<p><u>Main Hallway</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Hah!  Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah!”</p>
<p><strong>TUP! TUP! TUP! TUP! TUP! TUP!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Main  chapel</u></p>
<p><u></u>I barged in, calling out Uranus’s and  Neptune’s names.</p>
<p>“Uranus! Neptune!”</p>
<p>In front of  me I saw Uranus on the ground; her talisman already extracted.  Neptune was crying but whispering something to the fading Uranus. Her  life force…it’s…</p>
<p>It wasn’t only Neptune who was  sobbing, I turned to the group of beaten looking inners, also  tearing.</p>
<p><strong>Tup…tup…tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>All eyes were on  me as I proceeded forward towards my comrades.</p>
<p>“So…you  finally came.” Neptune looked up with sad eyes. Yet…there was  something similar to joy in them. I knew what she wanted; she wanted  me to take Uranus’s and her talismans.</p>
<p><em>‘I can only pray  that Rai will be here to guard and protect our talismans from the  Death Busters…’</em></p>
<p>A knot twisted in my stomach as I  contemplated the idea. In moments like these, I was eternally  grateful that I wore sunglasses in this disguise. No one can see my  doubt or uncertainty.</p>
<p>Dumbly my hands felt the heavy weight  of the gun as Neptune handed it to me as she stood up, ready to  embrace her own death. No…fear. She wasn’t afraid to die. The  courage to follow through with her own decisions touched something  deep inside of me.</p>
<p>Michiru…I’m sorry I hit you. I wish I  could say it.</p>
<p>I was sad…Here my chance to finish my own  goal I had made so long ago yet I was sad.</p>
<p>I lifted the  gun.</p>
<p>“Rai, don’t!” Sailor Moon called out.</p>
<p>“Please…”  She seemed to plead. A last request? “Find Tenoh Kaiya…And when  you find her, would you give her a message? Would you tell her that  she is still our best friend? She will know when she hears it.”</p>
<p>My  eyes began to tear. You  guys…</p>
<p>YAAAAAAAH!</p>
<p><strong>BAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong>FwooooOoOoOoOosh!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>An  aqua marine light hit the area as Neptune’s talisman was released.  Without a second thought I dropped the gun and quickly caught her  before she hit the ground. Her body was heavy, but not nearly as  heavy as my heart felt right then…</p>
<p>Carefully, I laid her  down next to Uranus. With both of their eyes closed, they almost  appeared to be sleeping peacefully.</p>
<p>It irked me. Why did this  have to happen? Death…The concept was difficult to grasp; I didn’t  want to believe it. I thought killing them would make me happy but  now that it’s actually happened, I see that it wasn’t what I  wanted. It was like sis said… ‘You don’t realize how important  someone is to you until they’re gone forever…’</p>
<p>…I  didn’t kill my parents, I killed my two best friends.</p>
<p>Another  aura came into the area and I instantly knew it was the Death Buster,  only it was significantly weaker. Neptune must have really gave her a  beating.</p>
<p>“Two talismans…only one left to go…” She  muttered to herself.</p>
<p>I didn’t turn around. “You dare to  show your face?” There was a mutter of agreement among the other  inners, their resentment beginning to seep throughout the room. We  all wanted to fight.</p>
<p>I won’t let her have your talismans, I  silently promised my parents.</p>
<p>“HEY!”</p>
<p>In one  smooth emotion I coveted both the space sword and the deep aqua  mirror. The witch wasn’t about to this take though and had shot her  fire fuelled gun.</p>
<p>“Flame buster!”</p>
<p><strong>SHHHHHRRRRRRRR</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Both  exits were immediately cut off by the fire wall and the other, by the  Death Buster herself. My eyes glanced around quickly and spotted the  staircase spiraling upwards to a higher floor.</p>
<p><em>‘That  way!’</em></p>
<p>I charged up the steps, listening intently as the  inners also followed close behind. The witch could be heard snarling  below, complaining about previously inflicted injuries as she  attempted to climb after us.</p>
<p><u>Tower of Rebirth</u></p>
<p><u></u>My  eyes trailed along another set of three separate paths. Great,  another crossroad.</p>
<p>“Hah…hah…”</p>
<p>“I don’t  think she’s be here for a few minutes.”</p>
<p>“I hope not,  this is a lot of running.”</p>
<p>The inners muttered. I disliked  the thought of parting with one of these talismans but…</p>
<p>It  might be the best way to protect them!</p>
<p>“Here.” I handed  Uranus’s talisman to the younger girls. My reasoning was Michiru’s  would be much more fragile and would be better off in my care. “You  better guard this with your lives. At the first exit you find, get  out of here and we’ll meet up later!”</p>
<p>Sailor Moon the  precious heart with great care and cradled it in her arms. Her  companions all nodded, understanding the situation fully.</p>
<p>With  that I ran to the right. As I left, I saw through the corner of my  eye that the rest of the senshi had taken opposite path.</p>
<p>Hopefully…this will all turn out.</p>
<p><strong>Tup! Tup! Tup!  Tup!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The corridor seemed to go on forever. Walls of stone  continued to whiz by as the pathway snaked continually to the right  and left. I didn’t think much about the odd architecture of the  place, only that it was leading somewhere. Still running, my eyes  noticed the sparse amounts of natural windows where one could see the  ocean. Outside was still dark and the moon was its only light.</p>
<p>I  suddenly felt the deep aura mirror begin to pulse. It felt like a  heart beat, as though it had a life of its own. But why was it  reacting?</p>
<p><strong>Tup! Tup! Tup! TUP!</strong></p>
<p>The corridor  finally lead me to a huge opening and into another large room. The  empty room was decorated in strange patterns; in the floor’s center  was a circle with smaller three circles equally apart along its  edges. To my dismay, there were no other exits that I could make out.  There were two other entrances but something told me they were the  same two paths that I decided not to take.</p>
<p>They must all  converge here!</p>
<p>My suspicions were confirmed when the inners  exited the opening direction in front of me. Another but slower set  of footsteps were making their way here through the one to my left,  the middle of the three paths.</p>
<p>Damn…I heard the witches gun  shot; she must be taking off our exits as she came up.</p>
<p>“So  we are all here…”</p>
<p>My eyes widened with fear and surprise  when another figure emerged from the position to my right. It was  Pluto! There had been no other pathway so I immediately assumed she  had been waiting in the shadows.</p>
<p>Her eyes trailed from the  inners who held the space sword talisman to me…where her eyes  lingered a few seconds longer. She knew…I gulped.</p>
<p>“Sailor  Moon step forward.” Pluto told the girl. Usagi did as she was told  and approached the pattern until she stood directly over one of the  smaller circles. Getting the nod from Pluto, I cautiously imitated  the moon princess until I was directly opposite to her. The entire  outer circle began to pulse, similar to the beat I felt within  Michiru’s talisman.</p>
<p>“We’ll hold her off!” I heard the  rest of the senshi shout.</p>
<p>Pluto stepped forward with an  unreadable expression and filled the last spot.</p>
<p><strong>FSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSH…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The remainder of  the circle came to life, lighting up a symbolic diagram on the  floor’s center. The jewel on Pluto’s garnet rod then detached and  hovered directly in front of its owner. Immediately after the space  sword and the deep aqua mirror followed suite. Michiru’s talisman  left my arms and positioned itself in front of me, pulsing as it did  so.</p>
<p>Wow…I awed. It looked like Sailor Moon felt the same  way I did by her expression.</p>
<p>“Venus love-me  CHAIN!”</p>
<p>“Sparkling wide PRESSURE!”</p>
<p><strong>BLAM!  KABOOM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Grr…She’s getting closer.</p>
<p>“What  the-” My attention shot back when I felt a small push. It felt like  an invisible hand was trying to push me out of the small circle.  Sailor Moon on the other end stumbled back, her confusion evident but  I knew different; this wasn’t my spot.</p>
<p>Without a fight, I  stepped back, allowing the true holders to take their  place.</p>
<p><strong>FWOOOooooOOOOoooooOOOOOSSSSsssSSH</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I  stared as Neptune andUranus appeared in front of their  talisman. Their eyes were still closed. What would happen now?</p>
<p>Two  small lights began to sparkle around the talismans until the heart  crystals emerged.</p>
<p>So…</p>
<p>“Ahhh…” Sailor Moon  awed.</p>
<p><strong>FwooooOoOoOoOosh.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I felt their aura’s  came back to life again. Slowly, Uranus and Neptune both opened their  eyes, trying to understand what was happening.</p>
<p>“What?  We’re…” Uranus said.</p>
<p>“…Back?” I heard Neptune  finish.</p>
<p>Both of them then turned to me and then finally  stopped on Pluto.</p>
<p>“It is time.” Pluto informed us  all.</p>
<p>All three talismans shone out white light, their rays at  first firing in all directions until they converged into one tiny  thread each, meeting overtop the floor pattern. Powerful energy waves  washed over the room, making the air pressure incredibly intense. I  found that I had to dig my feet into the ground just to stay upright  while the three outers seemed to find no difficulty at  all.</p>
<p><strong>SSsssHssssSSsH-</strong> <strong>CLANG.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>A bell-like  sound announcement a new power. Overtop where the three light rays  converged was what appeared to be a cup. I wasn’t sure what it was  but I knew it held great power.</p>
<p>“FINALLY!”</p>
<p>I saw  the Death Buster had arrived. She gasped at the sight as well, desire  apparent in her red eyes.</p>
<p>“Sailor Moon!” The outer called  to the younger girl to take the object.</p>
<p>“TURBO-”</p>
<p>Uranus  and I acted. “<strong>World…SHAKING!</strong>”</p>
<p>“FIRE!”</p>
<p><strong>WHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRRRR-<br />
  SHHHHHRRRRSH-</strong></p>
<p><strong>KABLAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Both attacks  ended in a stalemate.</p>
<p>“NOOOOOOO!” The witch screamed;  Sailor Moon had just taken grasp of the cup.</p>
<p>There was  another flash of light and once it had cleared we all saw Sailor Moon  had transformed into a stronger form. Desperate, the witch shot off  another blast before anyone could make a  move.</p>
<p>“HAH!</p>
<p><strong>SHHHHHRRRRSH-</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>To all our  amazement and surprise, Sailor Moon stopped the blast with one hand  and sent it spiraling back at the witch, sending her flying out one  of the windows.</p>
<p>“GAAAAAAH!”</p>
<p><strong>SMASH!-tinkle…  tinkle…</strong></p>
<p>What power…</p>
<p>“Ah…A new  transformation.”</p>
<p>“Wow…”</p>
<p>“Amazing…do you  think she could be the one destined to save us from the Silence?”  Uranus whispered to Neptune.</p>
<p>Now that the matter was  resolved, I turned to leave, anxious to depart before Pluto would  catch me. Instead, I found myself held up by Neptune; who wished to  thank me for some strange reason.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” She said as  held her talisman close to her heart. Uranus nodded behind her, yet  the wind senshi’s eyes were still somewhat accusing.</p>
<p>In  reply, I hung my head, still feeling ashamed of my past actions.</p>
<p>“Is  something wrong?” I shook my head.</p>
<p>The rest of the senshi  except Pluto tried to make me feel better.</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t  worry, we won!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you really helped us there; I was  scared there for a minute that you wouldn’t show.”</p>
<p><strong>PING!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Sailor  Pluto now commanded the room’s attentions; she had slammed down her  garnet rod’s hilt onto the floor. The sound echoed throughout,  causing a stir of confusion in the room.</p>
<p>“Do…you think  something wrong?” Jupiter nervously asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t  know.” Mars replied.</p>
<p>Sensing where this was going, I jumped  back and away from the others to make some space between us. Soon the  guardian of time and I were facing each other, separated by the width  of the room itself.</p>
<p>“Pu, what’s wrong?” Mini moon called  out to Pluto. Guess they know each other…like that was going to  help me!</p>
<p>“Pluto deadly scream!” She  whispered.</p>
<p><strong>WHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRR-</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I  evaded to my left, out of its path.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>BLAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“What  are you doing!” I could hear Uranus and Neptune question. All the  others were tense as well, not sure of what to do.</p>
<p>Looking  unperturbed by the miss, Pluto stood tall as she began to state, “  I bid thee to return to the future where you belong. There is no  place for you here.</p>
<p>No! Don’t tell them!</p>
<p>“What?”  I heard the senshi ask shocked. I could feel their eyes on me. “Did  she just say the future?”</p>
<p>“World…SHAKING!”  I released the blast.</p>
<p><strong>WHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRR-BLAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>More  dust particles flew up into the air, creating a stronger screen as it  combined with Pluto’s.</p>
<p>Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>WHOOSH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>She  shot out of the dust screen, swinging her garnet rod at legs. As the  horizontal attack came, I jumped up and countered with a kick only to  see it being deflected by the back end of her rod.</p>
<p><strong>Whap!  Whup!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Still in the air and unbalanced by the counter  attack, Pluto took the opportunity to drill her weapon into my  stomach and sent me flying back.</p>
<p><strong>WHAM!</strong></p>
<p>It took  a few seconds before my body came to a rolling stop.</p>
<p>“Uhh…”  I didn’t see that coming! Maybe…being old has its advantages  after all; she must’ve seen a lot of this already. I staggered up  to my feet just as her second attack came. Without a lot of strength  left in me, I couldn’t react in time as her hand gripped my head  and pushed me back into the back wall.</p>
<p><strong>Thud!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“I  gave you, your warning…” She whispered to me. But why was she  fighting so brutally? Why did she want me to go back to the future so  badly?</p>
<p>Her hand gripped my sunglasses and crushed them,  sending the fragments to the ground. My hands automatically came up  to shield my eyes from the other senshi’s view. Doing so, I could  only hear Pluto leapt back and wait helpless as she continued her  speech.</p>
<p>“I bid thee to return to the future where you  belong. There is no place for you here.”</p>
<p>A suddenly  realization hit me; where were my bracelets? Oh no…</p>
<p>“Heir  to the throne of Uranus and Neptune, Tenoh Kaiya!” I heard the  bracelets crack and my disguise disappeared. I was now  powerless.</p>
<p>Gasps rocked the room and a string of comments  issued.</p>
<p>“What? No way!” Jupiter exclaimed.</p>
<p>“It  must be a mistake.” Ami agreed.</p>
<p>I let my hands drop from my  eyes; she told them and now they know. I can’t hide it anymore. She  had me…</p>
<p>“I don’t believe it!” Uranus yelled  out.</p>
<p>Neptune gasped beside her, her eyes wide with shock and  surprise.</p>
<p>“Kaiya…” Mars whispered. Venus stood still,  not knowing what to do or say.</p>
<p><em>‘It won’t be wise to  fight now…What will you do? You’re powerless’</em> K-chan  thought to me.</p>
<p><em>I…</em></p>
<p>Pluto turned her attention  away from me, most likely concluding that I was no longer a threat.  “The Silence will be among us very soon.” She told the other  senshi, who were still looking at me with disbelief. “As to prevent  this horrible disaster from occurring we must eliminate the Messiah  of Silence, Tomoe Hotaru.”</p>
<p>“That can’t be!” Chibimoon  cried out.</p>
<p><em>‘They want to destroy sis!’</em></p>
<p><em>‘…’</em></p>
<p>Although  Pluto did take my bracelets, she didn’t take back that time key! My  hand grasped the object hanging about my neck and lifted it up into  the air. Who cares what happens to me…“I won’t let you!” I  shouted defiantly as a flash of pink light shot out from the  key.</p>
<p>“Kaiya!”</p>
<p>Without another thought I stepped  back into the portal and raced off, knowing full well Pluto will not  take this lightly.</p>
<p>Hotaru-chan…I have to get there  first!</p>
