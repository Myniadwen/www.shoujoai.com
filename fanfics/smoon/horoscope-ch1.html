<h1>Horoscope</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kazeko.html">kazeko</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Note: Every time the scene changes, so does the time period.  
You can see from the timeline above how complicated and all-encompassing 
this fic is.  Some parts require knowledge of the 5th season of Sailor 
Moon to understand.  There is a slight spoiler for the end of 
&quot;Desperately Searching&quot; and the end of the &quot;Chronicles of the Star 
Senshi&quot;.  Enjoy!

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

The shrill screech of the alarm clock filled the small apartment, 
followed by a sharp crash and sudden silence as a seriously annoyed hand 
introduced it to the idea of flight.  The owner of that long-fingered 
pianist&#39;s hand groaned as she pushed the blanket off her face.  Now she 
had to buy another new clock.  Haruka glared at the remains of her only 
time piece and considered going back to sleep.  No, she couldn&#39;t.  &quot;I 
have a race today,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;Coach will kill me if I don&#39;t show 
up.&quot;  Resigning herself to her fate, the tall, blonde, masculine, Junior 
High School track sensation, Junior F-1 Racer, playboy, untamable flirt 
slipped out of bed, kicked her now-broken clock, and headed for the 
bathroom.  Ten minutes later, after a very brisk, cold shower, Haruka 
emerged, drying her short, unruly hair with one hand and digging through 
her closet for a clean uniform with the other.  Any clean uniform would 
work.

Haruka wandered into the kitchen of her apartment, buttoning her shirt 
as she draped her jacket across the back of her chair, heading for her 
cupboard.  Grabbing the nearest half-eaten box of extra-sugary American 
cereal, Haruka poured herself a bowl, dumped some milk over it, and 
inhaled the small meal.  Her mother would have been upset at her eating 
habits, but Haruka loved sugar too much to give it up.  Dropping her 
dishes in the sink, the blonde opened her door and retrieved her 
newspaper, dropping it on the table as she gathered her school supplies.  
She flipped to the horoscope as she buttoned her jacket and straightened 
her tie.

[&quot;AQUARIUS: Jan. 21&#151;Feb. 19: This is your prime time, so watch who jumps 
on your bandwagon this week.  You could meet someone who supplies what&#39;s 
been lacking in your love life.  Show how well you can take charge this 
weekend, when an unexpected delay tests your mettle.&quot;]

Haruka snorted.  &quot;Yeah, right.&quot;

*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Michiru hummed as she brushed her hair, her alarm clock silent.  She 
never needed it.  Her meal was simple but healthy, including fruit and 
bread and juice.  She hated the American sugar cereals, knowing that it 
caused cavities.  Hair brushed, the woman straightened her skirt and 
grabbed her sketchpad, taking the paper with her.  She always read it on 
the bus to school.

As the scenery sped past, Michiru skimmed through the head stories, 
finding one about a handsome blonde racer winning yet another race.  
Ten&#39;ou Haruka.  She was half in love with that racer, though she knew 
that Haruka was a woman and not a man as the media claimed.  She had a 
favorite fantasy about riding along the beach in Haruka&#39;s gold 
convertible, the one place the sea and wind met, the one place she would 
feel content and could forget her Senshi duties for just a little while.  
Turning the page, she flipped through the paper, ending on the horoscope 
pages.  Silly superstition.  Michiru wouldn&#39;t dare plan an important 
event without consulting her almanac for good and bad days, but the 
horoscope was so Americanized that it was stupid.  Somehow, though, she 
couldn&#39;t look away.  Sighing, the aqua-haired Junior High student read 
the words.

[&quot;PISCES: Feb. 20&#151;Mar. 20: You&#39;re strong enough to change your life for 
the better this week.  Follow your inspiration to a pot of gold.  Your 
heart could be blown away by an Aquarius this weekend.  Sharing strong 
opinions seals your destiny together.&quot;] 

Aquarius?  Michiru snorted as she closed the paper, eyes landing on the 
racer&#39;s face.  So strong, yet so feminine.  Thinking for a moment, 
Michiru realized that a friend of hers, Elsa Grey, was going to be in a 
race that afternoon.  And Ten&#39;ou Haruka was one of her opponents.  And 
Haruka was an Aquarius . . . This was stupid!!  She couldn&#39;t believe 
that stupid little line in the paper!  And still, she had a feeling . . 
. Kaiou Michiru, Sailor Neptune with a duty to fight the Silence, 
decided to obey that damn horoscope.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Haruka dried her hair, glaring at Michiru as she sat serenely on the 
couch, sketching.  &quot;Never again, Michiru-san.  Skinny dipping&#151;any 
swimming&#151;is not for me.&quot;

&quot;You caught on,&quot; the artist smiled.  &quot;We&#39;ll try again later.&quot;

&quot;Never.  I feel like I need another bath!  How do you get all of the 
salt out of your hair?!&quot;

Michiru shrugged as she readjusted the sleeves of her borrowed shirt.  
&quot;I never have a problem and I swim all of the time.  Maybe you just need 
to get used to it.&quot;

Haruka leaned closer, emerald eyes glowing.  She placed her free hand on 
Michiru&#39;s cheek, freezing the artist&#39;s pencil, her half-buttoned shirt 
showing a great deal of her still-damp cleavage.  &quot;I said &#39;no&#39;.  No more 
swimming.  Not unless you can beat me in a fair race, humans and 
Senshi.&quot;

Michiru caught her breath and touched Haruka&#39;s cheek.  &quot;I&#39;m game 
whenever you are.&quot;

The blonde snorted as she moved away, throwing her towel carelessly 
across the chair.  &quot;Whatever.  Anyway, do you want me to take you home 
yet?&quot;

Michiru froze at the words, tears filling her eyes.  &quot;Do . . . do you 
want me to go home yet, Haruka-san?&quot;

Haruka paused, turning to face her aqua-haired guest.  &quot;No, I don&#39;t.  I 
didn&#39;t think you would want to stay around me much longer.  But I don&#39;t 
have much to eat . . .&quot;

Michiru smiled as she placed her sketchpad on the table.  &quot;I&#39;m sure I 
can find something.  After all, you treated my wounds.&quot;

&quot;Speaking of your wounds, let me look at them.&quot;  Haruka stood behind 
Michiru as the artist removed her borrowed shirt to reveal the bandages 
she had replaced after her swim.  She hadn&#39;t let Haruka examine her 
wounds after she removed the sea- soaked gauze and the water-proof tape, 
so the blonde gently peeled the tape away, wondering if they had gotten 
worse.  Her emerald eyes widened at the smooth, unbroken, perfectly 
healthy skin revealed, unable to believe that the siren healed so fast.  
&quot;Michiru-san . . .&quot;

&quot;I know.  They&#39;re already healed.  I replaced the bandages to make you 
feel better.  It&#39;s part of being a Senshi.  I was afraid it would . . .&quot;

&quot;Freak me out?  No, Michiru-san.  I just didn&#39;t expect it is all.  So . 
. . what about supper?  You said you can cook . . .&quot;

Michiru laughed and took Haruka&#39;s hand, leading her to the kitchen.  
&quot;We&#39;ll find something, Haruka-san.&quot;

Unnoticed, a newspaper clipping lay on the table.  Haruka&#39;s horoscope.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*

[&quot;Aquarius: Jan. 21&#151;Feb. 19: There is trouble in your future, but a pure 
heart and the one you love can pull you through.  Don&#39;t trust strangers, 
beware false promises, and be true to your heart.  Today you will find 
what you are looking for.&quot;]

[&quot;Pisces: Feb. 20&#151;Mar. 20: Danger colors your every move, and darkness 
clouds your vision.  Don&#39;t let external problems ruin your relationship 
this week.  A sign will appear to light your way; trust in the love and 
strength of others.  Today you will find what you are looking for.&quot;]

Haruka stared at the words on the page, the matching line in both 
horoscopes.  &quot;Today you will find what you are looking for.&quot;  She cut 
out the horoscopes and put the clipping in her desk drawer beside the 
other interesting newspaper articles she had collected.  &quot;True to your 
heart,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;But what if I don&#39;t know what my heart wants?  
I can&#39;t fall in love with Michiru because of our mission, but . . . &#39;the 
one you love can pull you through.&#39;  Michiru.  And the pure heart . . . 
today we will find them.  Today the talismans will appear and three 
innocent people will die.&quot;  Haruka dropped the paper and headed for the 
pool where she knew Michiru would be.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Haruka watched Michiru sleep, smiling, unable to belief her good luck.  
Michiru loved her.  It was more than the lanky blonde had ever hoped 
for.  But there she was, sleeping peacefully, undisturbed by her lover&#39;s 
thoughts, lying on her back with one hand held to her breast and the 
other on her bare belly.  Her wavy aqua locks rested calmly over her 
shoulders, moving only slightly with her every breath.

&quot;Enjoying the view?&quot;

Haruka smiled, reaching out to take Michiru&#39;s hand.  She had known, 
somehow, that the younger senshi was awake.  &quot;I really am.  I don&#39;t know 
why I resisted your charms for so long.  Even my power isn&#39;t so 
incredible . . .&quot;

Michiru blushed and pulled Haruka&#39;s long fingers to her lips, kissing 
them gently as the memory of what transpired the night before brought 
another blush to her cheek.  &quot;It . . . it was my first time, Haruka.&quot;

&quot;With a woman?&quot;

&quot;With anyone,&quot; Michiru clarified, her voice shaking.  &quot;I . . . I hope . 
. .&quot;

Haruka wrapped her arms around her lover, pulling the smaller woman 
close.  &quot;You were perfect, Michiru.  I never would have known if you 
didn&#39;t say anything.  Do you think that some of it, some of us, was from 
before, from the life we can&#39;t remember?  Our time in the Silver 
Millennium, the vague images I dream every now and then, makes me wonder 
if we are reenacting our relationships from back then.  Were you and I . 
. . lovers in the Silver Millennium, and did we get in trouble for a 
relationship between two Senshi?  Did the queen punish us?&quot;

Michiru sat up and kissed Haruka&#39;s forehead.  &quot;No, I don&#39;t think so.  
Our queen must have been the most perfect woman and her power stemmed 
from love.  She could never have punished us for falling in love, 
especially if Tsukino Usagi is her daughter.  She forgives us no matter 
what we do.&quot;

Haruka nodded, remembering the day before when Usagi, Sailor Moon, 
touched the Holy Grail and transformed, saving them all.  &quot;And we will 
find the Messiah and she will also forgive us.  I just know it.&quot;  Haruka 
paused, letting her eyes caress Michiru&#39;s perfect body.  &quot;My horoscope 
was right.  I did find what I was looking for.&quot;

&quot;Haruka!  You don&#39;t believe that superstitious nonsense!&quot;

The blonde nodded emphatically.  &quot;Of course!  Because it led me to you.&quot;

&quot;Haruka, what do you mean?  A horoscope couldn&#39;t . . .&quot;  She was 
silenced by Haruka&#39;s gentle lips, ending the entire conversation.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*

[&quot;Aquarius: Jan. 21&#151;Feb. 19: Beware.  All signs point to a violent day 
with sacrifice and destruction.  Today you will have to choose between 
your happiness and the future of all that you love.  That choice will 
bring your death.&quot;]

[&quot;Pisces: Feb. 20&#151;Mar. 20: Your life today will prove insignificant to 
the preservation of the greater good, so make your death count.  Your 
closeness to your loved one will choose the course of battle, so be 
aware of your partner&#39;s thoughts.  Love will save the day if it proves 
true.&quot;]

Haruka stared at the paper, shaking her head.  How could it be true?  
How could something like that be printed in a newspaper?  It didn&#39;t seem 
real, actually.  Curious, she read the rest of the horoscope section, 
calling to mind which of the Senshi fell under which Zodiac sign.

[&quot;Aries: Mar. 21&#151;Apr. 20: Fight well and protect the ones you love.  
Death is not the only end and light can penetrate the darkest forest.&quot;]  
Rei.  Sailor Mars.  Die?

She skipped Taurus and Gemini, ignoring Cancer for the moment.  [&quot;Leo: 
July. 23&#151;Aug. 21: The path has been long and fraught with hardship, and 
the forest seems endless.  Perhaps today will bring you freedom, death 
or life.  Remember the one you love for you must embrace that love if 
you want to be reunited and create the perfect future.&quot;]  Huh?  That 
didn&#39;t make any sense.  Mamoru was alive and well in America and nothing 
that Galaxia did in Japan could hurt him.  Unless he was already dead.  
Haruka cleared her throat to banish the sudden moisture.

[&quot;Virgo: Aug. 22&#151;Sept. 23: All of the brains in the world mean nothing 
in a world of emotion where love is the truest and only power.  Never 
forget that, no matter how dark things become.&quot;]  Ami&#39;s genius had 
always been her greatest and most trustworthy power in battle.  If that 
failed, how could the Senshi win against Galaxia?

[&quot;Libra: Sept. 24&#151;Oct. 23: A true leader knows what to do in times of 
joy and peace as well as times of great war and strife.  Do not be 
afraid to lead your troops and die with your troops for that is the true 
mettle of a leader.&quot;]  Minako was also going to die.  Did that mean that 
the other Senshi and Sailor Moon were doomed?

[&quot;Scorpio: Oct. 24-Nov. 22: That which makes you different will not save 
you today.  You must accept your fate so that the future will come to 
pass.  When the moment comes for the most important choice, remember who 
your family is and let yourself love.  It is the only power that can 
make a difference.&quot;]  Setsuna.  Like the woman herself, the short 
horoscope was cryptic beyond belief.  The only word that made any sense 
was future, Pluto&#39;s power and domain.

[&quot;Sagittarius: Nov. 23&#151;Dec. 22: Your power has always risen from your 
strength, but today you must let your strength lead to another type of 
power, the kind that comes from the heart.  You have surrendered before 
and you must again, no matter the consequence.  Do not be afraid.&quot;]  
Makoto, physically the strongest of the Inner Senshi and very close to a 
match for Haruka herself.  If she wasn&#39;t going to be strong enough to 
defeat Galaxia, how could Haruka&#39;s power be enough?

[&quot;Capricorn: Dec. 23&#151;Jan. 20: The power of death is never the greatest 
and rebirth is merely a faint hope.  Remember that even those who seem 
to betray really do still love you.  That strength will help you in the 
forest.&quot;]  Oh, no.  Hotaru.  No one who loved Hotaru could possibly 
betray her.

Usagi.  Haruka had saved Usagi for last.  Reluctantly, Haruka&#39;s emerald 
eyes returned to the princess&#39;s horoscope.  [&quot;Cancer: June 22&#151;July 22: 
Love is your greatest power and will light the way in the darkest of 
times.  Those who fight for you always love you and will return when the 
world is safe once more.  Remember that you are never alone, and your 
power is the greatest of all.&quot;]  Never alone.  No, Usagi was never 
alone, and she never would be.  Not if Haruka had anything to say about 
it.

The blonde tore the page out of the newspaper and slipped into the back 
of the drawer where she stored newspaper clippings.  Tossing the paper 
into the recycling bin, the blonde headed for the kitchen, trying to 
push the words out of her mind.  She stopped still at the sight of the 
newspaper on the counter, the exact same one she had just thrown away.  
Reaching out, she opened it to the horoscope page.  It was empty, a 
caption reading that the psychics had not been able to see anything 
coherent that day and that it would return tomorrow.  Dropping the 
paper, Haruka dashed to the recycling bin and stared at the empty 
plastic container.  The paper was gone.  She reached out and opened her 
desk drawer, fully expecting the page she had just put in there to be 
blank or gone.  She was shocked to find that it, at least, had not 
changed.

&quot;Haruka?  What are you doing?&quot;

&quot;Nothing,&quot; the Senshi of the Winds whispered.  &quot;Are we ready to go?&quot;

&quot;Hotaru-chan is dressed and Setsuna-san is standing outside with a very 
sad look on her face.  I think she knows something that we don&#39;t.&quot;

Haruka took her mate&#39;s arm and headed for the door.  &quot;Maybe not.&quot;

*~*~*~*~*~*~*

&quot;Haruka?!  You&#39;re not dressed yet?!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m getting there, Michiru.  You&#39;re not ready, either.&quot;

The younger woman crossed her arms over her chest and glared at her 
mate.  &quot;Ruka, you promised Usagi-chan that we would be there on time!  
Please go brush your hair and find your suit.  It&#39;s a very important 
concert for Rei-chan and Minako-chan.  They&#39;ll be very upset if we don&#39;t 
show up on time!&quot;

Haruka nodded and reached into the closet, quickly locating the black 
suit that Michiru had deemed proper for the concert.  Michiru crossed 
her arms over her chest and watched the blonde dress, acting for all the 
world like an enraged mother with a troublesome child.

&quot;You&#39;re not a troublesome child,&quot; Michiru sighed, her fierce demeanor 
softening into a gentle smile.  &quot;You know that, koibito.&quot;

&quot;I know.  And I thought I told you that it&#39;s not nice to read my 
thoughts.&quot;

Michiru reached out and caught Haruka&#39;s hand, smiling kindly as she ran 
her fingers through the taller woman&#39;s perpetually-unruly hair.  &quot;I 
couldn&#39;t help it, Ruka.  You were pouting.  Very loudly.  Hand me my 
wrap and we can go.&quot;

Haruka brightened at the promise of a drive as Michiru wrapped a black 
lacy shawl around her shoulders.  She was also in black, the preferred 
color for a fancy concert&#151;or so she tried to tell her lover&#151;and the 
matched pair headed for Haruka&#39;s car.  Before they got there, Haruka 
paused and turned her lover to face her.  &quot;Michi, what do you want for 
Valentine&#39;s Day?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, Ruka.  I hadn&#39;t thought about it yet.&quot;

&quot;But it&#39;s on Monday and today is Friday!  Are you sure you don&#39;t know?&quot;

Michiru took Haruka&#39;s long-fingered hand and kissed it gently.  &quot;I have 
you, koibito, and that&#39;s all I ever needed.  No amount of fancy presents 
and flowers can change that.  I only need you, and I only ever have.&quot;

Haruka swallowed, fighting the tears that threatened to spill from her 
eyes.  &quot;That was . . . I don&#39;t know what to say, Michi.&quot;

Michiru shook her head and pulled Haruka to the car.  &quot;You don&#39;t have 
to, koibito.  You never have to.  Let&#39;s go, shall we?&quot;

*~*~*~*~*~*~*

As Haruka watched Rei&#39;s concert, amazed at how the woman had grown in 
power and talent since they first met, she slipped her arm around 
Michiru&#39;s shoulder and pulled the woman closer.  She had no idea what 
she would do for Valentine&#39;s Day, but she knew what she wanted to do 
that night.  Michiru purred softly against her shoulder, and Haruka knew 
that she was thinking the same thing.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Haruka opened her eyes, panting, as a very vivid vision faded from her 
mind.  Mermaids and Skylings, Elves and Faeries and Fire Walkers . . . 
everyone was there.  All of the senshi.  What was that?  She looked over 
at Michiru, frowning at the pain on her lover&#39;s face.  She could sense 
the younger woman&#39;s terror and love . . . Michiru&#39;s blue eyes shot open 
as the dream ended, and she stared up at Haruka.  &quot;Picture,&quot; she 
whispered.  &quot;Do you remember that picture, Ruka?  The one of the angel 
and mermaid!  Usagi-chan once said that their people would never let 
them be together.  It was true . . .&quot;

&quot;We found our own way, koishii,&quot; Haruka whispered, pulling Michiru 
closer.  &quot;It was nothing but a very strange dream.  Maybe it stems from 
what we were up to last night,&quot; she purred suggestively.  Michiru 
giggled and nodded.

&quot;I really don&#39;t know what got into you, either.  Was it Rei&#39;s concert?&quot;

&quot;I think so.  Or that dress you were wearing . . .&quot;

Michiru smiled and closed her sapphire eyes.  &quot;Go to sleep, koibito.  
We&#39;ll talk in the morning.  Go back to sleep now.&quot;

Haruka stayed awake long after her lover&#39;s breathing had steadied, long 
after the moon set, until the first faint blush of dawn touch the 
darkened sky, and she finally knew what she was going to give Michiru 
for Valentine&#39;s Day.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*

&quot;Sir?  I have shown you all of the rings we have . . .&quot;

Haruka shook her head.  &quot;These are all too plain for her.  She&#39;s a very 
special woman.  Do you have a special one?&quot;

The clerk raised his eyebrow as he remembered the new rings that had 
just come in.  &quot;We do, but . . . it is very expensive, sir.&quot;

Haruka rolled her eyes and slipped her wallet out of her pocket.  It was 
one that Michiru had bought for her, dark navy with her name in kanji in 
gold across the cover and in English on the inside.  She considered it a 
little too expensive for her tastes, but it was a functional tri-fold, 
and that was all she cared about.  &quot;Money is no object where love is 
concerned, you see.&quot;  The clerk caught sight of her name and almost 
fainted, catching himself on the counter.

&quot;Gomen&#39;nasai, Ten&#39;ou-san!  I had no idea . . . let me get the ring right 
now!  I am sure you will like it!&quot;  Haruka chuckled at the power of her 
name as the little man scurried out of sight, never noticing a certain 
green-haired senshi peek into the shop in a very un-Senshi like move.

&quot;What is Haruka-san doing in a jewelry store?&quot;  Setsuna backed away so 
the blonde would not see her as she continued her trek to the candy 
store.  She had promised Hotaru some chocolates, American chocolates, 
for Valentine&#39;s Day.  &quot;I guess she&#39;s getting Michiru-san a present,&quot; she 
decided.  &quot;That must be it.&quot;

*~*~*~*~*~*~*

[&quot;Aquarius: Jan. 21&#151;Feb. 19: This year Valentine&#39;s Day is very special, 
so make sure your partner sees that.  No matter what you do today, your 
partner will never forget it.  It is a good time to secure an old 
relationship and make it forever.&quot;]

[&quot;Pisces: Feb. 20&#151;Mar. 20: Today let your heart speak for you.  This is 
no time to be indecisive when your partner makes a move.  Today will be 
very special for you.&quot;]

Haruka folded the paper and whispered a brief prayer to every kami and 
bodhisattva she could think of, palms sweating as the paper joined all 
of the other special horoscopes in the drawer.  Today had to go well.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Michiru and Haruka finished the song, both bowing, the aqua-haired woman 
reluctantly letting her mind return to the mundane plane from its flight 
with Haruka far above the earth.  In the past, before she met her 
soulmate, Michiru&#39;s spirit wandered alone during her performances, and 
she always knew that she was missing something.  With Haruka, though, 
she felt complete, their minds and spirits so closely linked that 
neither felt complete without the other.  The muted applause as the 
music faded was the rowdiest the small, elegant nightclub would support, 
but the only person that mattered to Michiru was her partner standing at 
the piano.  Haruka bowed again, gesturing for Michiru to wait before 
leaving the stage.  She took center stage and cleared her throat, 
waiting for the noise to die down.  Michiru couldn&#39;t see her partner&#39;s 
nervousness for all the years that they had been together, for which the 
blonde was grateful.

&quot;Michiru and I have been performing together at least since we began 
High School seven years ago, and we have been playing duets here almost 
that long, certainly before I became known for the piano.  That is why I 
chose this diner for tonight.&quot;  Michiru looked at her lover, eyebrows 
raised, as the tall blonde turned to face her.  &quot;Michiru, we have been 
together for a long time, and I would like for &#39;a long time&#39; to become 
&#39;forever&#39;.&quot;  She crouched down on one knee, pulling a small blue box out 
of her pocket, watching as Michiru&#39;s sapphire eyes filled with tears.  
The aqua-haired senshi swallowed, hands flying to her mouth as she began 
to shake her head almost imperceptibly in wonder.  

Haruka opened the box, revealing the perfect ring she had argued with 
the clerk at the jewelry store about, praying that it was good enough 
for her Michiru.

A sigh spread through the room at the absolute beauty of the ring that 
shone brightly enough to be visible to every patron of the diner.  
&quot;Aishiteru, Michiru,&quot; the blonde senshi whispered.  &quot;Will you marry me?&quot;

Absolute silence reigned in the diner as Haruka held her breath, blood 
pounding in her ears, heart beating as fiercely as if she had just run a 
marathon, her entire world hanging on her lover&#39;s answer.  She could 
feel the other diners leaning forward in their seats, praying for her, 
knowing that the magic of Valentine&#39;s Day would help bring those two 
perfect hearts close together.

Michiru reached out one trembling hand, finger just barely brushing 
across the tiny diamond flower on the golden band, and her sudden 
half-sob broke the tension in the room.  &quot;Yes,&quot; she whispered, tears 
running down her cheeks.  &quot;Kami-sama, yes, Haruka.&quot;

The blonde pulled the delicate ring out of the box and slipped it on 
Michiru&#39;s slender finger, biting her lip until it was safely on.  She 
had been so afraid that it wouldn&#39;t fit.

Suddenly overwhelmed by the sheer reality of her lover&#39;s answer, Haruka 
shot to her feet and pulled Michiru into her arms, kissing her as cheers 
sounded through the formerly quiet room.  Gods she loved this woman!

*~*~*~*~*~*~*

&quot;I remember,&quot; Michiru whispered, her voice full of many more decades of 
knowledge and maturity.  &quot;What horoscopes?&quot;

Haruka grinned, the roguish motion dispelling her business-like Uranus 
persona.  &quot;Well, about that . . . I still have them.&quot;

&quot;Haruka!  After all this time?&quot;

&quot;They were important to me,&quot; the blonde whispered, heading to a nearby 
chest.  Opening the lip, she removed an ancient envelope protected by 
many spells to keep the pages fresh and handed her wife clippings from 
extinct newspapers, the ink faded but readable.  Michiru scanned the 
small kanji and tight hiragana, printed by a press that no longer 
existed, last remnants of a fallen civilization, and she laughed.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you, Haruka!  This is us . . . these words were written 
for us!  Oh . . . are these from the day we fought Galaxia?&quot;

&quot;Yes.  They weren&#39;t in the regular paper and the one I got them from 
vanished when I threw it away.  They didn&#39;t disappear, though.  It took 
me a long time to realize that those words were saying that we were 
destined to lose against Galaxia so that Sailor Moon could heal her and 
bring her back into the light.&quot;

&quot;We should frame these,&quot; the sea senshi mused as she glanced around 
their living room for a place to hang them.  Like all of the Senshi who 
lived in the Crystal Palace, the Ten&#39;ou-Kaiou pair owned an entire 
suite, almost a wing of the spacious palace, which was expanding again 
after the threat of the Black Moon family was gone.  Also, the Queen was 
pregnant and wanted her next child to have as much space as Chibiusa.

Haruka caught Michiru&#39;s hands and stared into her partner&#39;s sapphire 
eyes.  &quot;I missed you so much,&quot; she whispered, all hilarity gone.  &quot;You 
can frame and hang up whatever you want if it means that you won&#39;t ever 
leave me again.&quot;

Michiru slipped one hand free and caressed Haruka&#39;s cheek.  &quot;Never, 
koibito.  I never meant to leave you, and it almost killed me.  It will 
never happen again.&quot;  She kissed her wife, all of the passion they had 
shared when they were younger returning, surging through them, and 
Haruka groaned.

&quot;Can we finish this conversation with a little less clothing on?&quot;

Michiru giggled.  &quot;Of course.  But first I have a surprise, a 
Valentine&#39;s Day gift for you.&quot;

&quot;Valentine&#39;s Day?  Today?  I thought it was a few days ago.&quot;

&quot;It was.  The day you and I were reunited when you pulled me from the 
depths of the gas clouds of Neptune.  Do you remember the power surge 
when the life-forces of our planets touched to free me?&quot;

&quot;Of course I do!  I was sore for so long . . . even when we went back in 
time so you could give Usagi-chan a blood transfusion before she even 
met us.&quot;

Michiru smiled and twined fingers with her wife.  &quot;Ruka, do you remember 
the last time you and I were linked by that much power?  Or, rather, the 
first time?&quot;

&quot;When we conceived Helios?  And Kazeko?&quot;  Haruka&#39;s emerald eyes widened, 
and she fell, landing in Michiru&#39;s lap.  &quot;Michiru . . . you&#39;re not 
saying . . . I wasn&#39;t even thinking it!  Honest!&quot;

Michiru grinned.  &quot;But it happened anyway.  Haruka, in nine months, you 
will be the proud mother of triplet girls.&quot;

&quot;Three?&quot;  For the first time in her life, Haruka fainted.

&quot;Happy Valentine&#39;s Day,&quot; Michiru whispered.</pre>
