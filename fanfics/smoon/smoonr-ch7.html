The Past Returns 

Crystal Sailor Moon woke up to find herself lying ruins, she 
recognized where she was right away. We&#146;re on the Moon, she thought. 
&#147;Where ARE we?&#148; Healer asked, &#147;And what is this place?&#148; 

&#147;Ah Yaten-chan I see you haven&#146;t changed at all. Still asking a 
million questions, just a curious as a kid. But I&#146;m not surprised that 
you don&#146;t remember anything.&#148; Queen Serenity said from behind her, 
&#147;That&#146;s how I arranged things.&#148; 

&#147;Okaasan!&#148; Sailor Moon said, &#147;Why did you bring us here?&#148; 

&#147;I&#146;m here to tell you guys the truth. There was more to your past than 
I told you the first. I wanted to wait until all of you were reunited 
again and see what happened.&#148; 

&#147;I don&#146;t understand.&#148; 

&#147;Then I&#146;ll show you.&#148; there was a flash of bright light. 

Queen Serenity&#146;s voice (as the Moon Palace is shown at night): [I knew 
Fighter and you were in love with each other from the first time you 
laid eyes on each other. And as much as I hate to say it a Princess or 
any other royalty for that matter was not to be in love or have a 
long-term relationship with Sailor Senshi. But no matter what you two 
always managed to see each other. (shows Princess Serenity sitting on 
her bed in her night gown) So I tried to keep your relationship 
low...] 

The door opened to reveal Seiya in her bed clothes on, she closed the 
door behind her and locked it. Serenity stood, &#147;Sei-chan, I thought I 
wouldn&#146;t see you at all today. Where were you?&#148; she asked. &#147;Senshi 
business, Queen Serenity doesn&#146;t want us to discuss it with others.&#148; 

&#147;Not even with me?&#148; 

&#147;Nope. But if you&#146;re a good girl then maybe.&#148; 

&#147;Ne Sei-chan, do you think you could sleep with me tonight? I know it 
puts us at risk, but I don&#146;t care about that now. I haven&#146;t seen you 
all day.&#148; 

&#147;Sure Princess Odango, but...do you think we can do uh, more than 
sleep?&#148; 

&#147;You terrible Sei-chan! Completely terrible!&#148; 

&#147;I know that, but you didn&#146;t answer my question...&#148; Seiya said lying 
next to Princes Serenity. Serenity turned to face her, &#147;Now why do you 
think we should make love?&#148; Seiya pulled her closer, &#147;Because it&#146;s 
like you said, &#145;I haven&#146;t seen you all day.&#146;&#148; 

Meanwhile Luna was talking to Queen Serenity. &#147;Queen Serenity, your 
daughter is of fourteen, if we&#146;re going to have her be wed to Prince 
Endymion of Earth we must do it now.&#148; Luna said. &#147;I know, time sure 
flies by fast huh Luna?&#148; Serenity sighed. &#147;Yes, you are right 
majesty.&#148; &#145;How am I going to tell my daughter?!&#146; Queen Serenity 
thought. 

When Princess DID find out she was NOT happy, &#147;But mother, you can NOT 
allow this! You know that I&#146;m in love with Fighter!&#148; she exclaimed. 
&#147;Daughter this was arranged LONG before you met Fighter. You shouldn&#146;t 
be in love with her in the first place! You know the rules--&#148; &#147;Royalty 
are not to be in love with their senshi I know. But you could have 
told me sooner!&#148; Queen Serenity changed the subject, &#147;You are to him 
tomorrow on Earth.&#148; Princess Serenity was about to speak, but her 
mother silenced her, &#147;I am through speaking, you may leave now.&#148; She 
said firmly. Tears in her eyes, Princess Serenity ran to her room. 
When she reached her room she slammed the door shut and laid on her 
bed crying. Then there was a knock at her door. &#147;Go away whoever you 
are.&#148; Serenity said through her tears. Then the door opened, &#147;I said 
go away.&#148; Serenity repeated turning around to face the visitor. &#147;Do 
you really want me to go Odango?&#148; Sailor Star Fighter asked. 
&#147;Seiya!!!!&#148; Serenity cried and hugged her causing both of them to come 
crashing down on the floor. &#147;Odango what&#146;s wrong? And why are you 
crying?&#148; 

&#147;My mother wants me to marry Prince Endymion of Earth!&#148; Serenity cried 
tears pouring from her blue eyes. &#147;Why? I thought you told her about 
us?&#148; 

&#147;I did, but you know the rules between royalty and senshi. I&#146;m 
supposed to marry only royalty. I&#146;m supposed to only be married with a 
prince. Not Sailor Senshi, but I can&#146;t, I won&#146;t! I want you Seiya!&#148; 

&#147;Odango...&#148; Fighter whispered caressing Serenity&#146;s cheek with her 
gloved hand. Serenity then smashed her lips against Fighter&#146;s, locking 
them in a long passionate kiss. During this Fighter felt the straps on 
her fuku being unhooked, her firm, round breast being exposed. 
&#147;Serenity don&#146;t, I&#146;m on duty and--&#148; 

&#147;I want to make love to you one more time before I sell my soul away 
to the devil.&#148; Serenity said and kissed her again. 

She removed her gloves and guided her hands under her dress. Fighter 
soon found out that Serenity wasn&#146;t wearing any panties. She slipped 
two fingers Serenity and started pumping her. &#147;Ohhh Seiya!&#148; Serenity 
moaned and began grinding against her fingers. When their clothes 
Serenity pushed Fighter onto the bed leaving the Starlight only in her 
boots and choker. She began placing kisses on her neck, her fingers 
gently caressing her breast. &#147;Mmmm Odango, that feels good. Give me 
more...&#148; Her lover&#146;s kisses slowly moved towards her breast gently 
sucking her nipple. A slight moan escaped Fighter&#146;s lips. Serenity 
began squeezing her other nipple. &#147;Ohhh Odango!!&#148; She started to feel 
Fighter&#146;s juices on her thigh and the juices from her own womanhood. 
Serenity&#146;s kisses went directly towards the juices were coming from; 
she sucked on her clit hard. &#147;OHHH Odango! OOOOO,&#148; Fighter began 
pulling on Serenity&#146;s hair, pushing her head deeper inside her. 

Fluids were spilling from her as she continued to suck her. 
&#147;Odango!!!!&#148; Fighter shouted and came in her mouth. Serenity licked 
the cum off of her inner thighs. &#147;Sei-chan, fuck me.&#148; Serenity 
whispered in her ear. The two switched positions and Fighter gave her 
at least twice the pleasure. 

[CM] 

The next day Princess Serenity went to go meet her future husband, 
Prince Endymion. Over the Years they started sleeping in the same bed, 
but Serenity always saved herself and all her love for Fighter. Soon 
enough Endymion found out about their relationship. And the penalty 
was either death or exile of the entire group. 

The day of the exile the Inner Senshi tried to comfort her, &#147;It&#146;s ok 
Princess.&#148; Jupiter said. &#147;Ok my ass!&#148; Mars said, &#147;If you really love 
Seiya-chan you&#146;ll go after her and stop her from leaving before it&#146;s 
too late!&#148; 

&#147;She&#146;s right go after her!&#148; Mercury said. &#147;Stop talking about it and 
DO it!&#148; Venus ordered. So, as fast as her legs could take her she ran 
towards the royal gardens, but by the time she got there they were 
already gone. &#145;I&#146;m too late!&#146; Serenity thought and dropped to her 
knees crying. &#147;I&#146;m sorry daughter, but I had to.&#148; Queen Serenity said 
from behind. &#147;I hate you! Never come near me again!&#148; Princess Serenity 
ordered and left. 

[Light fades and the senshi where they were, but no youma in sight] 

&#147;So that&#146;s what really happened, we were sent to Kinmoku...reborn...&#148; 
Healer said. &#147;I still don&#146;t believe it.&#148; Sailor Moon said. There was a 
moment of silence, then Fighter broke it, &#147;I knew there was something 
about you that I felt before we can to Earth the first time Odango.&#148; 
Crystal Sailor Moon smiled, &#147;Same here, but I was so caught up about 
Mamoru and other things that...well you know...&#148; Then all the youma 
appeared, &#147;SHABON SPRAY!&#148; Mercury shouted wanting to end the battle 
quickly so Crystal Sailor Moon could destroy them. 

Later that night Usagi and Seiya were lying in bed together cuddling 
with finger laced together Usagi asked, &#147;Sei-chan, what would you do 
if you found out that you were king of Earth?&#148; Seiya shrugged, &#147;I 
duno, but as long as I can have you nothing matters.&#148; She whispered 
and kissed Usagi&#146;s forehead. Usagi snuggled against her and soon went 
to sleep. </pre>
