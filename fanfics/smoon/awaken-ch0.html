<h1>Awakening (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/aimei.html">Aimei-chan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Usagi, laying on her bed in her room, gazed up at the ceiling. Rei
would be leaving for Kyoto today... She had been planning on going
to spend vacation with Mamoru in America, and already had a
couple bags packed, but he had insisted that she stay in Japan... He
had said that she wouldn&#39;t have much fun in America, and she would
just be bored... Usagi hadn&#39;t been able to figure it out, but had
merely shrugged it off saying, &quot;Okay! Maybe next vacation, Mamo-
chan!&quot; She had really been hoping to visit America, but she wasn&#39;t
about to go there against Mamoru&#39;s wishes... &#39;I sure have changed
over the last couple of years...&#39; she thought, with a heavy sigh.

&#39;Of course, Spending vacation with Rei-chan will be just as fun!&#39;
Usagi thought, and smiled gleefully. The goldenhaired hime then
looked over to her packed bags sitting next to her closet, &quot;I can&#39;t
wait!&quot; &#39;... As long as I can get mom to let me go...&#39;

Usagi snuck up behind Ikuko who was washing dishes from
breakfast. She slowly leaned over to peer over her shoulder. She
formed her mouth into a pout. &quot;Can I go on vacation with Rei?&quot; she
asked, awaiting a response. Ikuko abruptly stopped from doing her
dishes. She turned around.

&quot;Where to?&quot; the older woman asked, her hands on her hips. Usagi
blinked.

&quot;Um... It&#39;s Kyoto...&quot; she mumbled, tapping the tips of her index
fingers together. She looked up at Ikuko, then closed her eyes
awaiting her mother&#39;s response...

&quot;That sounds like a great idea!&quot; Ikuko said, to Usagi&#39;s obvious
surprise. She jerked her head up, and her eyes popped open.

&quot;Really!?&quot; she asked, enthusiastically.

&quot;Hai... After all, That Hino Rei girl is a miko. She&#39;s really smart,
Maybe she&#39;ll tutor you while you&#39;re on your trip.&quot; Ikuko smiled. Usagi
blinked.

&quot;Sure mom!&quot; she smiled happily, as Ikuko turned back to continue
doing her dishes. Usagi then thought, &#39;ALRIGHT! Mission One
Complete! Now the other problem... Getting Rei to let me come...&#39;
She sighed, and headed upstairs, to pack her things...

&quot;REEEIII-CHAAANNN!!&quot; Usagi whined, fluttering her eyelashes. She
pulled her right hand up, and began twirling a golden strand of hair
around her finger. Rei ignored the hime&#39;s innocent look, and walked
past her with a gentle shove so she could reach her suitcase. Usagi
looked back to Rei, persistently. She wasn&#39;t giving up yet.

&quot;No, Usagi. I already told you. You are -not- coming with me to
Kyoto!&quot; Rei responded, as she squeezed her eyes shut purposely
trying to ignore Usagi&#39;s pleas. She brushed the hair from her right
shoulder, and let the silky raven strands flutter down against her
back. She began to lay the folded clothing in the suitcase once again
as she had been trying to do for the past hour...

Usagi leaned up to Rei, barely brushing against her back and
placed her chin on the girl&#39;s left shoulder gingerly, causing Rei to
stop abruptly from packing. Usagi turned her head slightly, So that
she was facing Rei. Rei&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly, and her bottom lip
curved downwards into a frown.

&quot;How many times do I have to say this before it gets through to
you... -NO-.&quot; Rei responded to Usagi&#39;s acts of innocence. She gently
jerked her shoulder away from the goldenhaired odango-atama, and
turned around. She placed her hands on her hips, and Usagi just
continued to look at her with her huge pleading eyes. Usagi&#39;s
thoughts remaining on her determination to make Rei let her
accompany her to Kyoto. She had heard that Kyoto was a beautiful
place, and the sakura trees were especially beautiful in the Spring
and Summer...

&quot;Odango-atama, Cut it out with the eyes already!&quot; Rei said, and
brought her hands up, and covered her face with them. She held her
two middle fingers on her right hand barely apart so she could see
Usagi&#39;s reaction. Her reward was to see Usagi with a childish smile
creasing her lips.

&quot;Does that mean it&#39;s working?&quot; Usagi asked, enthusiastically. She
leaned up closer to Rei&#39;s covered face, her eyes wide and her mouth
slightly open in a curious expression.

&quot;Uh!&quot; Rei jerked her hands away from her face and spun around,
her back once again facing Usagi, then continued to pack. &#39;I&#39;m not
giving up that easy...&#39; Usagi vowed, secretly. She walked around Rei,
and stood in front of the suitcase, preventing the miko from packing.

&quot;Rei! -Why- can&#39;t I go with you?&quot; persisted Usagi, her eyes now
slightly narrow, and her mouth formed upwards in a babyish pout.
Rei restrained from laughing, and sighed.

&quot;The whole reason I&#39;m going on this vacation is for some time -
away- from you! Besides, Aren&#39;t you going to spend vacation with
Mamoru!?&quot; Rei responded, glaring at her friend. Her eyes were
stern, and her frown was slowly shrinking. &#39;I can&#39;t stay mad at her...
Gods! What is it with those damned eyes of her&#39;s!?&#39; Rei mentally
cursed, as she continued resisting Usagi&#39;s adorable charm...

Usagi backed up slightly, her eyes now wide with shock. &quot;What&#39;s
that mean?...&quot; she asked, tears welling up in her eyes. She sat down
on Rei&#39;s bed, next to the luggage, and was about to break down
crying when Rei sighed once more and pushed the suitcase aside.
She sat down beside her, and placed a hand on Usagi&#39;s shoulder.
The odango-atama turned her head to meet Rei&#39;s comforting gaze.

&quot;Look Usa, It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t enjoy being in your company. I just
need a vacation...&quot; Rei said, then added secretly, &#39;Though you don&#39;t
know the real reason...&#39; She cleared her mind of her thoughts, as
Usagi muttered something.

&quot;But... How am I supposed to spend -my- vacation if I don&#39;t go with
you?&quot; Usagi asked, gingerly, &quot;... So should I go get my bags?&quot; Her
cute puppy eyes seemed to come out of nowhere, and she got as
close to Rei as she could without falling on top of the miko. Rei&#39;s
right eyebrow flickered slightly, as she slowly raised a clenched fist,
trying not to be too angry at her best friend. Usagi just continued to
look at her.

Rei then pulled away from the blonde, and screamed, &quot;USAGIII!!&quot;

&quot;So where we gonna stay, Rei-chan? Huh? Huh?&quot; Usagi asked, as
they stepped out of the train, her enthusiasm at its pique... Her
ponytails were trailing behind her, fluttering softly from the wind. Rei
sighed and stopped to think about why she had let Usagi come in the
first place. &#39;Those godforsaken eyes!&#39; she reminded herself.

Rei then looked at Usagi again. She had a smile, her sapphire eyes
large and excited, Her short white dress blowing slightly. Her hands
were pulled together in front of her, and she looked so cute that Rei
could figure out why her name meant &#39;Bunny&#39;. Rei couldn&#39;t help but
smile at her friend... She never had been able to resist Usagi&#39;s
charm... The miko rolled her eyes.

Rei had only wanted a little time away from Usagi to sort through
her feelings and so maybe she wouldn&#39;t have to fight with Usagi for a
couple months. No matter how much she refused to admit it, Usagi&#39;s
sweet smile was the one thing that kept her going, and she hated to
see her hime cry. Now she was going to be in another city for two
months, alone with Usagi when she had merely wanted some peace
and quiet away from her... Rei looked up at the sky, and cursed
under her breath, &#39;Damn the gods!&#39; At that moment, She knew that it
was going to be a long vacation...</pre>
