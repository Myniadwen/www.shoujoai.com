<h1>Dreams Can Lie (part 17 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dreamlie-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>&#147; I can&#146;t believe how long that took!&#148; Universal Sailor Mars and 
Universal Sailor Mercury walked through a large rip in the dimensional 
rift. 

&#147; Yeah, who would have thought there was a Batman dimension! At least 
Teri and Bruce helped us back. I will never forget Teri&#146;s face when he 
found out you were married to a Terri, and a woman no less!&#148; The two 
sailor suited warriors laughed for a minute. Mercury and Mars had 
gotten themselves lost among all the many dimensions. Fortunately they 
had clambered into the Batman dimension. Somehow they managed to meet 
up with Teri Miginis and Bruce Wayne. The two men helped by supplying 
them with a sufficient amount of power to open the rift. After 
laughing their grins were replaced by a mask of determination. 

&#147; Alright Ami, see if you can&#146;t trace Terri&#146;s energy signal.&#148; Mercury 
nodded and tapped her blue studded earring. Her translucent visor 
materialized and her mini computer popped into her gloved hands. 
Typing like there was no tomorrow, Mercury walked around following the 
energy signals and searching for a match. After a few minutes the 
little compact computer beeped, alerting them both. 

&#147; Here, this rift. This time it&#146;s an exact match.&#148; Blue and red seeped 
from their bodies and glowed around them.

&#147; Mars Universe!&#148;

&#147; Mercury Universe!&#148; 

Power exploded and gathered into a swirling ball of red and blue. More 
gathered and made its impact upon the dimension fabric. Ripping 
through, the Senshi followed it through&#133;

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~***

It had been a month since the young woman had landed on the hood of 
his black limacine. Johnny Smith had taken her in, given her a job, 
and a name. The woman was named Jena Smith. After three days of being 
out of the hospital she had healed completely. Her modeling career had 
rocketed and her beautiful face was everywhere you looked. 

&#147; Jena we&#146;re ready for you!&#148; Jena walked gracefully out on to the set 
in a blue knee length sundress. Her white and chestnut hair in a braid 
down her back. Blue eye shadow and pink lipstick caressed her face and 
her feet were adorned in plain cream colored sandals.

On her wedding finger were two rings, a gold band, and a beautiful 
stone encrusted silver ring. Jena had never learned of the wedding 
dress she had been wearing that day, or that she might be married. 
Possibly she never would. 

&#147; Jen your stunning! Stand over with Seth. Okay, Seth pick her up. 
Alright&#133;hold that. Great!&#148; The camera clicked and hissed as Johnny 
moved them into different poses. Every now and then they changed 
outfits hurriedly. The last two hours of the working day was filled 
with nothing but this. Finally the end of the day came for Jena.

Jena slipped into her dressing room. Changing into sparkled short 
shorts, a evergreen thick strapped tank, and Adidas sneakers. She 
brushed out her lengthy white hair as a knock sounded on her door. A 
tall blonde haired man walked in.

&#147; Hey J, wanna go out for dinner?&#148; She smiled.

&#147; Sure. How about that place on Park Ave? It&#146;s close and I don&#146;t feel 
like taking the limo.&#148; They walked out of the studio to where a guard 
drove them to the gates in a studio jeep. Soon they were chatting 
their way down the sidewalk and into the busy city of L.A.. 

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~***

&#147; Ames, I&#146;m getting hungry. Let&#146;s go out. &#147; Ami looked up from her 
newspaper and stood from the couch of their hotel room.

&#147; Good idea. We&#146;re set up here. Maybe we&#146;ll spot Terri since her 
signal is scrambled now.&#148; Rei nodded and they were engulfed by light. 
A second later they were gone.

The two ended up on Park Avenue. The streets were over crowded with 
people so no one noticed they appeared out of no where. Rei and Ami 
picked a restaurant and were seated out on the balcony by the sea. 

&#147; You know this is turning into a bad movie. Terri will probably have 
amnesia when we find her.&#148; The blue haired genius nodded in agreement. 

&#147; And we don&#146;t have the power to bring it back so we&#146;d have to go 
around it the hard way. At least my hair isn&#146;t brown in this 
dimension.&#148; Rei giggled. Poor Ami had been stuck with brown hair in 
Gothum. 

&#147; Here we are Seth. Ocean Blue, Johnny said it was superb.&#148; They 
looked at each other.

&#147; Ami, that voice, it sounds like&#133;&#148; Ami nodded and the two turned in 
their seats. Coming up the stone steps of the restaurant was a man and 
woman. Something sparkled on the woman&#146;s left hand. 

&#147; Rei! It is a clich&eacute;!&#148; The Ice Queen was up in a flash and over to 
the two newcomers. 

&#147; Terri!&#148; Jena and Seth looked towards the blue haired woman coming 
over to them. Surprise and a familiar feeling took control as the 
woman hugged her fiercely. 

&#147; Do I know you Miss?&#148; Ami let go.

&#147; Oh Rei she does have amnesia! Please don&#146;t let this get worse!&#148; 
Jena&#146;s eyes focused on the woman hurrying over.

- Wow, she&#146;s hot!- 

&#147; Dragon&#133;do you know who I am?&#148; Jena looked at the raven haired 
goddess before her. 

&#147; I&#146;m sorry, no. Do you know me or something?&#148; Rei&#146;s eyes filled with 
tears as she lifted her left hand. Bringing into view a matching set 
of rings to the set on Jena&#146;s hand. She gasped at the sight.

&#147; You should, were married.&#148; A fuming Seth pulled Jena back behind 
him. 

&#147; Who the hell do you think you are?! Jena Smith is no dyke!&#148; Rei&#146;s 
eyes flashed dangerously at the name, Ami joined her. 

&#147; I am Rei Hino and &#145;Jena&#146; is Terri Hino. We&#146;re married, and I love 
her. Her memory just hasn&#146;t surfaced you ignorant bastard.&#148; Her teeth 
clenched as she spoke to him.

Jena had taken to the railing for support. Holding her head, her 
breathing had quickened.

&#147; Dragon!&#148; Rei rushed to her side. Wrapping her arms around her love 
to keep her from falling.

&#147; That name&#133;&#148; Images flashed through her brain like wild fire. 

* Memories*

&#147; Come get me Firebird!&#148;


&#147; Oh Endymion! Just like old times!&#148;

&#147; Serena! Come out of there! It&#146;s time for your checkup!&#148; 


&#147; Ami I can wa&#133;&#133;&#148;

&#147; Hotaru bring me that black fabric.&#148;

&#147; Mina wait! Lita said 350 degrees not 55...&#148; * BOOM*

&#147; Yea for Amara! Greatest racer of them all!&#148;


&#147; Mich, I&#146;m soooo nervous!!!!!&#148; 

* End Memories*

A headache was speeding her way. All these memories were overloading 
her brain. Laughing, sleepovers, training, battles, her brother, her 
friends, her scouts, her love&#133;Jena looked up at the frightened woman 
holding her.

- Such soft strong arms, so familiar. Maybe these memories are 
real&#133;Firebird.-

&#147; Firebird&#133;&#148; Jena fainted and went limp in Rei&#146;s arms.

&#147; Dragon!&#148; Seth grabbed the unconscious girl into his arms before Rei 
could do anything. He growled at Ami and Rei.

&#147; Stay away from Jena dykes! She&#146;s mine and no one else&#145;s.&#148; Rei would 
have punched him, if Ami hadn&#146;t of grabbed her arm. 

&#147; Calm down Rei, she&#146;ll remember soon. Then we can go home.&#148; Rei 
simply nodded numbly as she watched the man walk away with her wife.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~***

* Next Day *

Jena sat up slowly in her king sized four poster bed. Bringing a hand 
to her forehead she noticed that her clothing was now one of her silk 
nightgowns. 

&#147; Oh&#133;my head&#133;Stella!&#148; Her voice rang out as an auburn haired woman of 
sixty came through her doors. 

&#147; Miss Jena, feeling any better?&#148; Jena shook her head slightly.

&#147; No Stell, can I have some aspirin?&#148; The old woman pointed to her 
bedside table. 

&#147; Already for you dear. Would you like to see anyone or just go back 
to sleep?&#148; Jena downed the white pills and put her glass back to the 
table. 

&#147; Yea, I want to see Johnny and Seth. Plus some food would be nice. I 
don&#146;t think I&#146;ve ever been so hungry.&#148; 

&#147; Of course dear. It&#146;s lunch time now. I&#146;ll have them sent up with the 
food. It&#146;s rather nice out so I think the terrace is a nice place to 
eat on such a day.&#148; Jena grinned at her.

&#147; Thanks Stell.&#148; Stella laughed on her way out. 

After a few minutes, Johnny and Seth came into the room. Followed by a 
butler pushing a cart. They heard the shower running and headed out 
onto the terrace. Ten minutes later Jena joined them out on her 
balcony. Wearing low rider jeans that flared and had some stripes 
crisscrossing at the bottom, with a navy blue tank, and her Adidas 
sneakers on. Her hair still down and flowing around her. 

&#147; Hey J. Feeling any better?&#148; She smiled at him and sat down.

&#147; A little. What happened yesterday?&#148; The butler left after setting 
her food in front of her.

&#147; Two dykes thought they could take advantage of your amnesia. One 
even said you were married to her!&#148; Seth and Johnny erupted into 
laughter as Jena looked thoughtful. 

&#147; The one with amethyst eyes&#133;I called her Firebird&#133;we could be&#133;&#148; The 
two men stopped laughing.

&#147; Jen, you can&#146;t be serious! Your not a lesbian, you&#146;re a model!&#148; She 
scowled as they started laughing again. 

&#147; What&#146;s wrong with that?! How else to explain these rings?&#148; Seth put 
a hand on her shoulder.

&#147; Come on J. It&#146;s just so disgusting and&#133;wrong!&#148; Jena swatted his hand 
off of her. Standing as she fumed at them.

&#147; That&#146;s horrible Seth! I&#146;m going out. Don&#146;t follow me.&#148; Jena turned 
from them and stalked back inside her room. Grabbing her wallet she 
was gone and out of the large mansion. 

*~*~*~*~*~*~***

&#147; Ami see what&#146;s she&#146;s doing. Hopefully she&#146;s alone.&#148; The ice Senshi 
opened her palm as her mini computer popped into it.

&#147; She&#146;s on the move! Let&#146;s go!&#148;

*~*~*~*~*~*~***

- Oh how I love this maze. It&#146;s always so quiet.- Jena turned the 
corner and around the corner stood two women.

- From yesterday&#133;- She stopped in her tracks.

&#147; Dragon?&#148; Rei looked at her hesitantly.

&#147; Why do you call me that?&#148; She heard her own voice snap at them, 
though she didn&#146;t know why. The blue haired one stepped closer.

&#147; She always calls you that. It&#146;s your nickname and you call her 
Firebird. Please don&#146;t run away from us.&#148; Timidly she walked closer.

&#147; Can you&#133;can you tell me about myself? Who I know? How this 
happened?&#148; Rei nodded vigorously. 

&#147; You might not believe some of it.&#148; Jena was now next to them and the 
trio started walking.

&#147; Alright, first things first. What&#146;s my name?&#148; Rei and Ami smiled at 
her.

&#147; Well this will seem weird but&#133;you are Queen Terrestria. Your casual 
name now is Terri Hino.&#148; Jena looked confused at this.

&#147; What do you mean &#145;now&#145;?&#148; Taking her and Rei showed her the rings 
almost identical to the ones on her own hand.

&#147; We were married the day you were taken away from me.&#148; Ami giggled a 
bit. 

&#147; We are not from this dimension if you are wondering about the Queen 
thing. You decided to take Rei&#146;s last name when you guys got married.&#148; 
She turned to look at Rei&#146;s purple eyes.

&#147; We&#146;re&#133;married?&#148; Rei sighed breaking eye contact.

&#147; Yea, August 6th, but you jumped through a rift&#133;and well, here we 
are.&#148; Jena shook her head.

&#147; Better start from the top guys.&#148; They laughed and continued walking.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~***

It was almost six now. Ami and Rei had spent the entire day telling 
Jena, who now preferred the name Terri, about her life. Slowly she was 
starting to understand. The three had been laughing at a story Ami had 
told. Some how they had ended up in a rather secluded part of the park 
after dinner. There was a large pond and a few lonely benches 
surrounded by flowers. 

&#147; Hey I saw an ice cream stand. Want some?&#148; They nodded and Ami left 
through the path that had brought them here. Without thinking Rei sat 
down on a bench and brought Terri onto her lap. The white haired 
goddess didn&#146;t seem to mind as she became comfortable. 

&#147; Rei tell me how we got here? What exactly happened on our wedding 
day?&#148; Rei ran a hand through her love&#146;s white silver strands.

&#147; Let&#146;s see, um, You had just said I do when a Kyphon crashed through 
the glass skylight of the chapel. We all transformed except for you 
because the Kyphon was attacking you. After it was off you transformed 
and smashed the thing into a wall. It started a rift and to save us 
all, you jumped in.&#148; Terri hugged her tight.

&#147; I&#146;m sorry.&#148; She whispered. Her red lips found Rei&#146;s cherry ones and 
they kissed for the first time in more than a month. Rei kissed her 
with all the passion she had for her wife. The kiss deepened and they 
lost track of time as soon a clearing of the throat made them break 
apart.

&#147; Am I interrupting something?&#148; Ami giggled as they blushed red. She 
stopped suddenly when a pained looked crossed Terri&#146;s face. Terri 
jumped up from Rei&#146; lap clutching her head in pain. She started to 
scream and kneeled to the green earth. Her sign started to glow a deep 
black and pulsing as she screamed. Her body glowed black it&#146;s self, 
then evergreen, and finally periwinkle and intensified. Her screams 
grew in volume when she shot her head up and her eyes were clouded 
over. The screams stopped as black energy shot from the star on her 
head. Soon it was over as it had come and Terri&#146;s breathing was quick 
and sharp. Her body shuddered as she still glowed periwinkle, going 
back to evergreen, and stopping on black. 

&#147; Ami what&#146;s going on?&#148; The blue Senshi shook her head.

&#147; I&#133;am regaining m..my memories..&#148; Terri stuttered as she started to 
shake violently. Rei stood scared watching the one she loved in pain.

&#147; Why is this happening? This didn&#146;t happen to us when we regained our 
memories&#133;&#148; 

&#147; I think it&#146;s the power she holds in her that&#146;s causing this. Terri&#146;s 
never had to remember anything like this. Even Serena shuddered when 
we were given back everything a few years ago.&#148; Terri had stopped now 
and lay peacefully on the soft grass.

&#147; Dragon!&#148; Rei rushed to her side but was zapped when she touched 
Terri.

&#147; Give it a few minutes Firebird. I&#146;ll be just fine, trust me. Soon we 
can leave.&#148; Terri&#146;s eye lids fluttered shut and she fell asleep. A few 
minutes later Rei picked her up and smiled at her softly. They heard 
people running into the remote area and left just as they came through 
the path.
