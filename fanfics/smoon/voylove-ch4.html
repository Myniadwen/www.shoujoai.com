<p><u>Proper Etiquette in Food and  Love</u></p>
<p>“... And  last but not least- this is where we eat- the mess hall.”</p>
<p>Rei raised an  eyebrow at the name which described the room's exact opposite. Not a  single thing seemed out of place; the floors and walls glistened like  marble, and cobwebs were inconceivable. Seeing the shocked looks on  both Rei's and Mina's faces, Haruka grinned and explained, “I  know, weird isn't it? But Mako-chan seems to have a thing for  keeping everything neat and tidy. She helps the cook with the meals,  too.”</p>
<p>At that, Makoto  vertically pounded her fist into her palm, remembering her job. “Oh  that's right. I should go check on the meals. Excuse me.”</p>
<p>As Makoto  exited the room, Rei found herself chuckling slightly. Maybe it  wouldn't be so hard to revert the rogue Senshi into a different form  of piracy after all. At the sudden pressure around her arm, Rei  looked over and came face to face with a curious Mina. “Ne, ne  what's so funny? Tell me tell me!”</p>
<p>A light bulb  flashed in Rei's mind, prompting her to run a single finger from  Mina's forehead to the tip of her nose. Sure enough, Mina's eyes  followed the digit, making an adorable imitation of a puffer fish as  Rei pulled it away. “Tsk, tsk, Mina-chan. Your face is  dirtier than a pirate ship. Now as to whether that's a good thing or  a bad thing in this case...”</p>
<p>Mina puffed her  cheeks a little longer for good measure, before breaking into a  sultry grin, and leaning forward to whisper in Rei's ear, “Are  you going to clean me up later then...?”</p>
<p>Something about  her tone caused Rei's cheeks to heat up profusely, which in turn  caused a certain Pirate Captain to laugh at the situation she knew  nothing about, but had created amusing reactions.</p>
<p>Choosing not to  reply to Mina's question, Rei pulled away and walked in the direction  Makoto had gone, gruffly explaining, “I'm going to check the  menu. I'm already fairly aware of it, so Ruka-chan, please inform  Mina-chan about how pirates usually eat.”</p>
<p>To that, Haruka  called back, “Aren't you going to do it, Rei-sensei?”</p>
<p>Rei waved the  question away. “I'll be there for the real deal. Just soften  the blow for me- since, trust me, it's <em>nothing</em> like the Kingdom etiquette.”</p>
<p>The look of dawning apprehension was quickly becoming a new usual  for Mina as she watched Rei turn the corner. So lost in her  imagination was she, that she jumped nearly two feet when Haruka put  a hand on her shoulder. Once she had calmed down, Haruka, ever the  one for finesse, explained the basics, as there really was no other  way to do it.</p>
<p>“All righty, see here, Mina? There's only one utensil we use,  and that's a fork. If there's a big chunk of meat, you spear it and  bite off a chunk with your teeth. Oh, and when you finish the meal,  you lick off the rest of the food or sauce or whatever, and stick it  back into your pocket.” Haruka paused to laugh as Mina gave a  disproving look coupled with a light shudder. “You'll get used  to it. We'll even find a drawstring pouch for you guys, since these  outfits down have pockets. Well, mine and Rei's capes do, and your  boots have a special hidden compartment, but that's beside the point.   Let's see... oh, belching from one end or the other is a normalcy  that is never asked to be excused... we don't tuck napkins in over  our shirts or laps- there's a stack at the center of the table if you  can get someone to pass you one though. Hm... if you want something  at the other end of the table, you can try shouting it or getting  someone else to stand up and bring it over for you, since you're the  captain now... saying please and thank you are rarely if ever used...   Crude jokes are pretty common- you don't have to join in if you  don't want to, but if you get to know the crew, I'm sure they'll be  happy to let you in on it. Erm... and we don't say grace or whatever  at the beginning of the meal. I think that covers everything I  remember from dinner etiquette differences between here and the  Kingdom. Anything I miss?”</p>
<p>It took a few moments for the look of disgust to dissolve from  Mina's complexion, as the Kingdom was apparently as different from  Piracy as Day was to Night... but she eventually resigned to it,  stating, “I get it. Just act like the Princess in the morning  after she misses dinner, right?”</p>
<p>A hearty laugh erupted from the Wind Senshi before “I don't  know how much the Princess has changed since we last saw her... but  that sounds about right.”</p>
<p>“Ah... the good ol' days...”</p>
<p>Haruka blinked and looked to see a faraway glaze in Mina's eyes.  “You okay?”</p>
<p>“Encouraged to let go of years of etiquette lessons... eat  like we haven't eaten since we were six or seven... fun indeed... If  it keeps getting this promising, I'm going to start wanting to be a  full time pirate...”</p>
<p>At that, Haruka raised an eyebrow. “Do you hate it at the  Kingdom that much?”</p>
<p>“What's the reason <em>you </em>don't return?”</p>
<p>Haruka shrugged at the absently made question. “I'm an Outer  Senshi. I've always felt more comfortable protecting the Princes  from a distance.”</p>
<p>“Then Mako-chan?”</p>
<p>She's a borderline one, so it didn't take much convincing for her to  travel the seas with me.”</p>
<p>Mina sighed softly, casting her gaze down to her new pointy boots.  “It's not that I hate it; I've gotten used to the courtesy  we're supposed to show everyone. After I turn twenty-one... there's  no going back though. Oh how I miss those days...”</p>
<p>Haruka grinned. “Sounds like you're still living it.”</p>
<p>“Only one more week. Gah, one more week before I become an  official Lady.”</p>
<p>The older woman slung an arm around the other blonde's shoulder.  “You know, it ain't so bad, becoming an adult.”</p>
<p>Mina glared at Haruka. “<em>You</em> didn't spend it at the  Kingdom. It just came and went like any other day, for you.”</p>
<p>Her free hand went up to sheepishly rub the back of her head. “Ah,  yeah, that's true. It's still not as big of a deal as some make it  out to be though.”</p>
<p>Before Mina could reply, Rei returned with an attention-grabbing  clap of her hands. “Alright already. Finished?”</p>
<p>Haruka's grin returned. “Finished long time ago Rei-sensei.  So is Mina-chan's comparison true? Is pirate manners like the  Princess when she's starving?”</p>
<p>At that, Rei cracked with laughs instinctively covered by a hand.  Once she recovered, she scratched her head lightly and responded,  “That remains to be seen, but I wouldn't put it past her.”</p>
<p>Her whole aura having brightened upon seeing Rei again, Mina skipped  over to glomp her teacher. Knowing her intentions, Rei took one wide  step back, as to not allow enough momentum between them to result in  a fall. As it was, Rei put her hands on Mina's shoulders and slowly  held her out at almost an arm's length.</p>
<p>“Mina-chan... don't you know signs of public affection between  student and teacher are widely frowned upon?” Pausing only  slightly, Rei added, “Even among pirates.”</p>
<p>Almost as if she were ignoring Rei's protests completely, Mina  tilted her head up and kissed Rei on the lips. Rei seemed to be  having conflicting reactions before she roughly pushed Mina away, a  deep blush on her cheeks. Turning away, she whispered, “What...  what was that for?”</p>
<p>Mina grinned impishly, leaning around Rei with her hands behind her  back to see Rei's face. “Because I wanted to. Being taught by  you is a priceless honor, Rei-chan. So I want to return the favor  with my own source of priceless commodity. I meant it when I said  I'll love you always, Rei-chan. You, and only you. I don't care  what others say, because I'll never be afraid to admit it to anyone.  So, please, won't you let me show you, at least a little, how much  you mean to me?”</p>
<p>Upon realizing that there was little to nothing she could say  against that without seeming harsh, selfish, or outright rude, Rei  sighed and gave in once again. “Just... I just need some time  to adjust to the idea. In case you never noticed, I'm not nearly as  active in the whole love business as you are. I wouldn't want to  disappoint you before the 'game' has even begun.”</p>
<p>Mina giggled lightly at that, and gave Rei a quick hug. “Oh,  you could never disappoint me Rei-chan, so long as you stay true to  yourself. When you feel you're ready, all you need to do is show a  little initiative, and then I'll <em>really</em> prove we can be and  should be a couple.”</p>
<p>Backing away, Mina showed Rei a bright smile and asked, “So is  lunch ready yet?”</p>
<p>At that moment, Makoto returned with an iron triangle and rod.  “Yup. Now it's time to call in the crew. Mina-chan, want to  do the honors? It's not exactly a captain's duty, but Ruka-chan  usually does it because she can get her voice to project far.”</p>
<p>Mina scampered over and asked, studying the iron duo with obvious  curiosity. “What do I do?”</p>
<p>“If  I remember correctly, tap the triangle repeatedly while yelling as  loud as you can 'Lunch is ready, come and get it,'” Rei  answered for Makoto. “Call from the deck though; it'll  echo better.”</p>
<p>Nodding brightly,  Mina took the set and rushed out the door. As Rei sighed and sat  down at the right side of the table's head, Haruka walked over and  whispered to Makoto, “Apparently, their relationship is still a  bit shaky, so don't push it, okay?”</p>
<p>Makoto frowned and  turned to face Haruka. “That sounds more like your problem  than mine.”</p>
<p>Before Makoto  could reply, an earsplitting shout, loud enough to make the calm seas  produce medium waves as the ship rocked back and forth, beat away the  peaceful silence. “Geez, that girl's got one healthy set of  lungs. Not even <em>you</em> shout that loud, Ruka-chan.”</p>
<p>Still wincing,  Haruka had no choice but to agree. “You're telling me. Hey,  Rei-sensei- did you teach her to shout like that?”</p>
<p>Rei groaned as she  felt her headache grow. “Shouting is something Mina never had  to be taught. Restraining herself was one of the first lessons she  ever had upon entering the Palace. She's obviously enjoying acting  like a pirate... You mind opening the door when she takes a breath  and telling her to tone it down a little? I doubt even she will want  to run a deaf crew.”</p>
<p>“Neither  will we, for that matter...” Haruka grumbled as she made her  way to the door. Hearing the start of a brief pause, she snapped  open the door and relayed the message. There was a soft, sheepish  apology in return, before Haruka closed the door and a comparatively  softer call was sent to the crew. It was still loud, but not nearly  as bad on the ears.</p>
<p>“Come on,  Ruka... let's get our seats saved before the horde arrives.”  Haruka nodded at Makoto's wary suggestion, and moved a seat from the  corner to the end of the table.</p>
<p>“Rei-sensei,  should we sit to the side on your end, or do you think claiming this  end would work better? Since Mina-chan's the captain now, she should  be at your end so...”</p>
<p>Rei waved it off.  “Come sit over here. To introduce us to the crew, if nothing  else. You<em> do </em>know your own crew, right?”</p>
<p>Haruka scoffed.  “Oh please, of <em>course</em> I do. I've been the captain of  this ship since I gained my Senshi powers at fourteen. I can't spend  ten plus years in the same ship and not know its inhabitants, you  know.</p>
<p>“Just  asking. In another time, Mina might take a total of two days to know  everything about everyone, if she did nothing but that. She's a  sociable one, all right.”</p>
<p>“Nah,”   Mina disagreed as she opened the door, leading a horde of men also  referred to as the crew. “It only took an hour tops. See,  Rei-chan, this is Bebe... Rodrigo... Paul... Torres...” As  each burly crewman entered, Mina named them, ultimately impressing  all three of the present Senshi. Quietly, Rei counted every name  Mina listed, and when the last person filed through, it came to a  total of around one hundred twenty. If it only took an hour... she  would have had to at least memorize one name every thirty seconds.  And Rei knew she hadn't left Mina alone for anywhere near an hour's  length so how...?</p>
<p>Seeing her shocked  look, Mina grinned as she took her seat at the head of the table. As  the food began circling in via kitchen servants, Mina held up a thick  book that Haruka recognized instantly.</p>
<p>“Hey!  Where'd you get that? It was supposed to be locked in a drawer of  the captain's cabin!”</p>
<p>Not seeing it's  significance, Rei asked, “And... it's special because...?”</p>
<p>Mina answered,  “Among other things, it has a database of all the crew members,  their names, their ages, their jobs, their pet peeves- anything you  really need to know about them to be their captain, really. Cool,  huh? And to think, it was just lying there for any curious mind to  find...”</p>
<p>When she winked,  Rei groaned and cupped her face in her open palms. She'd known for a  long time that Mina was a master pick pocket and knew all the skills  a world-class burglar might. Heck, she could slip past the security  cameras and borrow royal jewelry for a night and return it, without  anyone being the wiser. Rei only knew because Mina had confided in  her that night. It was no surprise she could swipe a book like that  during a tour of the ship, and speed-read it while still paying  attention to the tour itself. When it came to things like that, she  could probably even give the Royal bookworm, Sailor Mercury, a run  for her money. Not that she'd try, but still...</p>
<p>As soon as it was  announced that the last dish was placed on the table, Mina stood, to  further introduce herself to the crew as their temporary captain.  She didn't go into any details, only saying she was a friend of  Haruka, who was doing this as a favor to her, but the crew didn't  question it. Raising their goblets to their new captain, a “Here,  here!” became the fanfare instigating the start of the meal.</p>
<p>It was just as  Haruka had explained. And later, Rei admitted that it was indeed  similar to how Princess Serena ate when she was particularly  ravenous, and didn't have to put up a polite front. As far as eating  manners went, Mina was perfectly atrocious, a sight Rei wished she  could have had taken a still portrait of. Even while stuffing food  from three different plates in her mouth at once, Mina was able to  carry a somewhat clear conversation with her fellow Senshi, while not  spewing any food at them. Rei had noticed a thin line of drool  escape those hungry lips though...</p>
<p>As for Rei, while  no one could say she was as bad as Mina, she seemed to have  maintained a perfect balance of how much to put in her mouth so she  could reply easily at the right moments, and when to take a drink  when she felt a burp coming on (goblet hides mouth, so you can't  really pinpoint it on her). Often times, Mina was tempted to spear a  small piece of something and offer to personally feed Rei, but that  would have to wait until Rei was either alone or had both arms  injured; the fire priestess was still had her timid pride, and Mina  had to respect that.</p>
<p>After watching the  closer crewman as far as manners went, and comparing them to the  Senshi, Rei noted that while Haruka, Makoto, and herself were showing  an adequate equivalent to the typical pirate's manners, Mina remained  a bit too... zealous. Rei only told her once to slow down so she  didn't choke- to which Mina did slow down.. about as much as a gun  can control how far it sends its bullet- before leaving her to her  own devices.</p>
<p>All in all, the  second lesson was a complete success. The fact the Haruka and Makoto  were already long since used to it... and Minako seemed to have a  natural calling for improper manners... helped immensely. Rei had  eaten a few meals with them before, and she had, in the privacy of a  Senshi only meal, had fought over food with the Princess, so in a  way, she too, had simply been used to it.</p>
<p>As the crew began  lingering and leaving to return to their duties about an hour later,  Rei began to wonder what the next mini lesson would be...</p>
<p>Dish Maintenance?</p>
