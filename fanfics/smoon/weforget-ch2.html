<h1>What Did We Forget? (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/venusreiko.html">Venus Reiko</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/weforget-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Rei sighed for what felt like the fiftieth time, her anger radiating off 
of her. Her amethyst eyes stared out of the backseat window of Makoto&#39;s 
car, not particularly looking at anything. All she could think about was 
how her odango-haired princess had ruined her day of well-deserved alone 
time with Minako.

&#39;Damn her for being born today! Why couldn&#39;t she have popped her little 
odango-headed-self out tomorrow? Or even yesterday?&#39;

She let out another sigh.

&#39;Okay, so maybe I&#39;m being a little harsh... After all, Usagi did help 
bring Minako and I together... And OK, it wasn&#39;t very nice of me to 
forget her birthday... But still! Baka Moon-bunny!&#39;

Minako glanced at the passenger side rearview mirror and saw Rei&#39;s 
reflection projected back at her. She frowned sadly at the expression on 
the raven-haired girl&#39;s face.

&#39;Poor Rei-chan, she looks so upset. Although...how could we have 
forgotten today was Usagi-chan&#39;s birthday party? She&#39;s only been 
mentioning it since the middle of May. Then again, summer vacation DOES 
throw everyone&#39;s sense of time out of wack. But then again...&#39; she 
smiled as she leant back into her seat, her baby blue eyes still glued 
on her lover&#39;s reflection. &#39;My mind-set is always thrown-off when I&#39;m 
with Rei.&#39;

She allowed her mind to go over every moment leading up to the day where 
she and Rei finally found each other. It was almost like a movie to her.

&#39;Yeah, like a romantic-comedy! But with gross monsters and teen-aged 
girls dressed in skimpy outfits! But I guess the whole &#39;girls in skimpy 
outfits thing&#39; isn&#39;t too uncommon when it comes to any movie...&#39;

After many unsuccessful dating stints, Minako had herself convinced that 
she was meant to be alone. She felt like her senshi title eluded her, 
and even cursed her. Sure, teen-agers were supposed to have 
relationships that ended badly and tore their hearts apart, but none of 
Minako&#39;s relationships even got that far. Right before she told herself 
she would allow herself to fall for the guy this time and let herself 
go, the guys either broke it off or turned into complete asses. It 
didn&#39;t help that Rei tried to talk her out of every relationship she 
ever got into, either. For a while Minako thought Rei was jealous at 
first, (not over the boys at the time, of course; Minako could&#39;ve never 
imagined Rei was interested in her) though she had no idea as to why. 
Guys were constantly begging to go out with her, but she always told 
them off and scared them away. The only one to ever stick around and 
keep on with his mission to attain her as his girlfriend was 
Yuuichiro-though he had yet to succeed.

It wasn&#39;t until one cloudy, humid, and otherwise uninteresting day when 
Minako became aware, somewhat painfully aware of Rei&#39;s hidden feelings 
for her.

The study group was moved to Minako&#39;s apartment that day since the 
shrine was being renovated, and grandpa feared five, very good-looking 
teen-aged girls would distract the men doing the job. Rei had rolled her 
eyes at her grandfather&#39;s mischievous grin but complied. Makoto&#39;s house 
was out since her fridge was empty (probably from a certain blonde&#39;s 
last visit), Ami&#39;s mother was at home sleeping (she worked the 
nightshift) so THAT was a no-go, but Minako&#39;s fridge was fully stocked, 
and her Mom would be at work until 11.

Gradually the food began to disappear and the group started to dwindle 
down until only Usagi, Rei, and Minako were left. Minako glanced over at 
Rei frequently, taking notice of how she&#39;d barely said two words to her 
the whole night. What was even stranger was how she made sure to break 
eye contact immediately the moment their eyes caught each other&#39;s. It 
made Minako uneasy. Had she done something wrong? Said something 
offensive? She racked her brain for almost two hours but nothing came to 
mind.

She watched as Rei performed her usual routine of teasing Usagi, a 
familiar yet so unfamiliar feeling welling up within her.

&#39;She&#39;s never been seriously mad at Usagi before. She&#39;s been upset with 
me, Makoto, the outers, and even Ami, but never with Usagi-chan. And 
I...&#39; She continued to watch as Usagi tried to pout at Rei but instead 
broke out into laughter with Rei following close behind. The feeling 
became worse.

&#39;I think I&#39;m jealous of Usagi. But why? They&#39;ve always been close and 
I&#39;ve never felt so... Ugh!&#39; She heard Usagi let out a loud grunt and 
turned her head towards the girl.

&quot;Well guys, it&#39;s been tons of fun but Mamo-chan is coming to get me in a 
few minutes.&quot; She gathered her books in her arms and stood up from the 
cushion she&#39;d been sitting on. Minako and Rei stood up as well, the 
latter also gathering up her belongings.

&quot;Usa-chan,&quot; Rei began, and Minako flinched at the pet name. &quot;Do you 
think Mamoru could give me a ride ho-&quot; Usagi cut her off.

&quot;Ahh, no! No, I DON&#39;T think he can! Maybe Minako-chan could walk you 
half-way home? Well, I have to go, bye!&quot;

With her speedy good-bye, the blonde was out the door and down the 
stairs in five seconds flat. How she managed not to trip, neither Rei or 
Minako knew.

&quot;Usagi!&quot; Rei called after her. In response, she and Minako heard a small 
giggle then the front door slam shut. Rei rolled her eyes and sighed, a 
hand coming up to rub the bridge of her nose.

&quot;Rei-chan?&quot;

Rei hesitated for a moment but then turned her head towards Minako. As 
soon as she saw those big, azure eyes looking at her worriedly, she felt 
her knees begin to grow weak. She forced herself to look away.

&quot;Hmm?&quot;

&quot;Why have you been ignoring me all night?&quot;

Rei knew that question was coming. She&#39;d felt Minako staring at her the 
entirety of the night, the hurt radiating from her stare. She&#39;d been 
hoping she could escape with Usagi, but it seemed the Moon Princess had 
other plans in mind.

&quot;I...haven&#39;t,&quot; she lied. She rolled her eyes at how unconvincing her 
voice sounded. But...it was always hard for her to pretend-especially 
with the blonde senshi in front of her. Minako&#39;s brow furrowed.

&quot;It sounds like you can&#39;t even convince yourself. What&#39;s up with you, 
Rei? You and I-we&#39;ve... Things are different between us lately. I&#39;ve 
been thinking back on the past week, and I can&#39;t figure out what it is 
that I did to make you distance yourself from me.&quot;

Rei couldn&#39;t find her voice or her usual strong will to express her 
feelings. To admit what she feeling- even to herself- could put so many 
people at risk. Too much was at stake and she would NOT let herself 
screw anything up-especially her friendship with Minako. However, it 
seemed as if she were already doing a decent job at that.

Minako grew irritated at Rei&#39;s recent vow of silence. The girl never 
held her tongue before; why was the current situation any different? 
Before she could stop herself, she marched forward and grasped Rei&#39;s 
shoulders roughly with her hands. The priestess jumped at the contact.

&quot;Answer me, Rei-chan!&quot; she cried out. &quot;Tell me what I did wrong, 
because...because I can&#39;t stand this horrible feeling!&quot;

Rei&#39;s eyes widened and she swallowed hard. &quot;W-What?&quot;

&quot;You and Usagi... I don&#39;t... You two are so close and I...&quot; Minako 
turned her eyes towards the navy carpet, ashamed to admit that perhaps 
she was in fact envious...of Usagi. It wasn&#39;t right. Soldiers couldn&#39;t 
feel such a sinful emotion towards their princesses they&#39;d sworn to 
protect.

&quot;What does Usagi have to do with anything?&quot; Rei gazed at her comrade 
intensely. She stepped forward, rapidly closing any remaining distance 
between them.

&quot;Minako...talk to me. This-is so unlike you.&quot; She frowned, muttering to 
herself, &quot;so unlike me.&quot;

&quot;Listen, Mina, we need to talk.&quot; She decided she&#39;d go against her better 
judgment. She couldn&#39;t lie to Minako anymore... She&#39;d have to tell her, 
and then, although things seemed to be tense, would be the best time to 
do so.

&quot;Ever since the fight between us and Galaxia, I&#39;ve been thinking a lot. 
A WHOLE lot. I can hardly sleep anymore because of it. It&#39;s just that... 
Well, that was the one time I had any doubt in my mind that we wouldn&#39;t 
come back; that THAT moment would be it. I would never tease Ami about 
some boy at the Crown that she thought was cute, but was too shy to talk 
to, ever again... I would never marvel at how Mako could have four 
things going on the stove and then two different foods in the oven, and 
still manage to make all of them come out perfectly, ever again... I&#39;d 
never fight with Usagi over who was the better leader ever again, and 
worst of all...&quot; She blushed slightly. &quot;I&#39;d never just get to be around 
you anymore, get to see you. I&#39;d never get to look at that smile of 
yours, or hear that laugh whenever you and I crack-up about the most 
recent Sailor V. comic, and how they totally screwed up your 
personality.&quot; Minako&#39;s eyebrows upturned and her head dropped.

&quot;I hate telling anyone about things like this. How I&#39;m feeling. It makes 
me feel like I&#39;m weak, like I can&#39;t handle things on my own. It worries 
me when I need other people to depend on. But, I...&quot; Rei trailed off, 
slowly bringing her gaze on to the blonde. &quot;Minako-chan, I like you. I 
like you more than I&#39;ve ever liked anyone in my life, and it&#39;s 
terrifying.&quot; She paused, waiting for Minako&#39;s reaction.

There wasn&#39;t one.

Taking this as an awkward but appropriate time to escape, she began to 
turn, only to have Minako grab her arm.

The goddess of love rose her glassy blue orbs to Rei&#39;s worried amethyst 
ones. Her lips parted, her white teeth showing slightly.

&quot;I like you too,&quot; she replied breathlessly, and for a moment, she could 
barely believe what she&#39;d admitted.

Rei&#39;s heart began pounding quickly in her chest. Minako...liked her?! As 
in &#39;more than a friend&#39;?!

Her question was answered when those pink lips which parted only moments 
ago were upon hers.

The kiss was somewhat like how Rei dreamt it would be-soft, light, 
teasing, and short. Very short. Too short for Rei&#39;s liking. Minako 
pulled back quicker than she&#39;d moved in. Her cheeks were flushed, and 
her lips had darkened a shade. She kept her eyes glued to Rei&#39;s. 
Although she was partially embarrassed and nervous, being shy-especially 
when it came to matters of the heart- was something she rarely ever was.

Rei&#39;s coloring in her face was similar to Minako&#39;s, her usual pale skin 
taking on a crimson glow.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Minako whispered, almost inaudibly.

Rei blinked. &quot;Are you really...?&quot;

Minako licked her own lips, her taste buds picking up a faint hint of 
sugar from Rei&#39;s tea.

&quot;...No.&quot;

She moved in again, this time wrapping her arms around Rei&#39;s neck and 
laying a lengthier kiss on the priestess&#39; lips. Rei&#39;s arms snaked around 
Minako&#39;s waist, pulling their bodies as close as they could get. They 
stayed this way for a few minutes, barely noticing they were moving 
closer to Minako&#39;s door that Usagi had left slightly open since her 
departure. Rei&#39;s back collided with the door, causing it to slam shut.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Aino opened the door to the apartment she shared with 
her teen-aged daughter and husband (whenever he was in fact there), glad 
to be home from her long day at work at a doctor&#39;s office. Sure she was 
just a secretary, and it was a rather easy job for her, but it was 
painfully boring most of the time, especially when her favorite 
gossiping partners were scheduled to work at a different office on 
certain days-which they had been that particular day. Luckily, the head 
doctor had gotten sick and cancelled all of his evening appointments, 
meaning the staff was free to head to their lovely abodes and relax for 
the rest of the night.

After placing her heels near the front door, Mrs. Aino hung her keys on 
the key-hook, seeing that her daughter&#39;s were dangling off of it as 
well. She smiled at the cute, mini-chibi plushy keychain of Sailor V. 
that belonged to her daughter, knowing how much Minako was addicted to 
the show and the comic.

&#39;It&#39;s probably because they look so much alike.&#39; She eyed the keychain 
thoughtfully. &#39;VERY alike.&#39; She shrugged and padded over to the kitchen. 
She opened the refrigerator, desperate for some kind of nourishment. She 
spotted a microwavable meal, debating with herself before grabbing it.

&#39;With my hubby out of town, it&#39;s not like I really have to watch my 
figure much, eh?&#39;

As she waited for her dinner to heat up, Mrs. Aino sat on her couch and 
flipped on the television, surfing through the channels to find 
something that would catch her interest. She settled on a make-over show 
after about two clicks. Mere seconds into the show, she heard her 
daughter&#39;s door close loudly. She rose an eyebrow.

&quot;Minako?&quot; she called, slowly rising from the couch. Feeling that her 
woman&#39;s intuition was strong-and usually right- she decided to 
investigate. It wasn&#39;t as if her daughter never slammed her door, but 
she felt like there was more to it-that her daughter was up to 
something.

She began her short trip up the stairs and then descended down the hall. 
She paused when she heard the floor creak from Minako&#39;s room. She poked 
her head out slightly, listening for further noise. Some shuffling was 
heard, along with a peculiar sound. Her curiosity got the best of her, 
so she placed her hand on Minako&#39;s doorknob and began to turn. She 
pushed the door with a small amount of force, hoping to give her 
daughter time to get herself-and whoever was in the room with her- 
together. However, when the door didn&#39;t budge, she grew even more 
suspicious. She applied more pressure, but the door STILL wouldn&#39;t give.

Mrs. Aino sighed heavily, realizing she&#39;d have to break it up the hard 
way.

&quot;Minako,&quot; she said. No answer. She frowned.

&quot;Mi-na-ko,&quot; she enunciated.

Rei and Minako abruptly stopped with their heated make-out session when 
they heard the voice of Minako&#39;s mother calling to her daughter...and 
her voice was VERY close. Minako&#39;s eyes grew considerably when she heard 
her mother repeat her name. Rei seemed to reflect the same expression, 
and she gulped loudly.

&quot;Minako, open the door right this minute!&quot; Mrs. Aino spoke loudly.

&quot;She&#39;s outside the door?!&quot; Minako mouthed, and Rei shook her head. 
Minako backed off of Rei and glanced around the room. Rei made the move 
to get off the door when Minako held her hand up and stopped her.

&quot;Lean on it for a few more seconds, Rei-chan!&quot; she whispered. The blonde 
grabbed one of Rei&#39;s books (apparently the priestess had dropped them 
earlier) and tossed it to Rei. Being caught off guard, the brunette 
barely caught the book and slipped out a very audible, &quot;Damn!&quot;. She 
glared at Minako but caught on to her plan.

She felt Mrs. Aino push the door once again, this time almost opening 
it. Minako went back over to Rei and gestured toward the bed. Rei shook 
her head and quickly tip-toed over to it, cracking open the book and 
sitting cross-legged on top of the comforter. After an affirmative nod 
between the two teens and a quick pat down of their hair, Minako reached 
for the door handle. However, before she could, her aggravated mother 
swung the door open...

And smacked her daughter right in the face.

The fiasco ended with a bloody nose and a partially bruised cheek for 
Minako, but she saw that day as much more. It turned out that Usagi had 
intentionally set up the two. She&#39;d told Rei&#39;s grandfather to come up 
with a fathomable excuse to move the study group in the first place, 
then asked Makoto to decline the offer to have it her house because 
she&#39;d supposedly &#39;ran out of food&#39;...which Usagi made sure of, of 
course. Ami&#39;s mother had in fact really been home, and actually 
encouraged the study meeting at the apartment, but with a strange and 
confusing explanation from her daughter&#39;s odango-haired friend, the 
apartment suddenly became unavailable as well. The only problem in the 
whole plan was obviously Minako&#39;s mother, who of course she hadn&#39;t 
anticipated.


&#39;But that&#39;s alright,&#39; Minako thought to herself with a smile, peering 
some more at Rei in the back seat. &#39;Her intentions were good, and 
everything worked out...for the most part. Usagi-chan is such a great 
friend. That&#39;s probably why she&#39;s the princess, because Kami-sama knows 
she certainly lacks the grace and sophistication...&#39;

Minako looked away from the mirror and leant back in her seat. &#39;In any 
case, Usagi deserves to have the best seventeenth birthday she could 
possibly have, and I&#39;ll make sure of that! I just hope Rei and I will be 
able to keep our hands off each for most of the night...&#39; Minako grinned 
and scratched the back of her head. She put on a determined mask and 
thrust her fist into the air, barely grazing the ceiling of the car. 
Makoto, the driver, eyed her suspiciously.

&quot;Minako-chan...?&quot;

&#39;I can do it!&#39;
