<h2>Hitting the Fan</h2>
<p>Finally, night had come.</p><p>
  The figure nodded to himself as he watched the Tendo  house.  Soon, it would be time.</p><p>
  He watched as the evening shadows grew longer and  finally, that damnable Chinese meddler and the defiler went back inside and hid  themselves from sight.</p><p>
  Time passed, and finally, his quarry appeared in the  window.  He moved forward, hands slipping  into the folds of his robe…</p><p>
  Then, a loose roof tile gave way, and he found himself  sliding.  He desperately sought purchase,  but there was no time before he was catapulted off the roof, and into a  telephone pole.  His glasses flew away  into the night as he slowly slid down the pole with a groan, finally collapsing  into blissful unconsciousness at its foot.</p><p>
  From the window of Akane’s room, China looked  towards the noise, but on seeing nothing, returned to reading her textbook,  trying to puzzle out the Japanese kanji as she read her homework assignment by  moonlight.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ukyo unlocked the door of the restaurant and  sighed.  She locked the door back behind  her and tossed the keys to one of the dining tables, not even bothering to turn  on the lights.  Grabbing a drink from the  soda machine, she wandered up the stairs to her living quarters and tossed her  spatula on the couch.  Putting the soda  down, she wandered to the bathroom, shedding clothes as she went to stand in  front of the mirror naked.  </p><p>
  She drew the tie out of her hair and tossed it on the  sink, letting her hair cascade down and fall about her shoulders.  She reached out a hand, the cold touch of the  glass reassuring her it was truly a mirror and not a portal to some world of  dreams… that she really <em>was</em> a  woman.  </p><p>
  Gods, how could Ranma stand shifting back and forth  like that?  It was bad enough pretending  to be a guy, and she was pretty tomboyish in many ways.  But she never forgot who she really was,  never forgot she was a girl.</p><p>
  But sometimes, it could be really hard.</p><p>
  She stared at herself for a long time, reminding  herself she was a girl, imprinting the mute evidence of her femininity on her  brain as she contemplated the shambles Ranma had made of her life today.</p><p>
  And that strange girl, Zhu Shu.</p><p>
  She closed her eyes, and knew that Zhu Shu had fallen  asleep crying, knew she was in despair, and it only reinforced her own black  mood.  She was a girl, dammit!  She was supposed to grow up and marry and  have kids and…</p><p>
  …And she never would. Ranma had seen to that.  She either married a girl, or had nothing to  look forward too but living in the restaurant, eeking out a living making  okonomiyaki, denied the fortune that was rightfully hers.  And she had to get used to the idea that  without Ranma, she was stuck playing a guy… forever.  Officially, her dad’s money had already made  her a man in the eyes of the law.  Her  licenses were all to Ukyo Kuonji, male.   She could dance around naked in front of the courthouse, and it would  make no difference.  She was legally  male, and her father’s will ensured she would have to stay that way.  No lawyer she’d talked to had seen any  outs.  She either married Ranma and  returned to being a woman, or she didn’t, and continued playing at being a  man.  </p><p>
  She looked at herself again, noting the curves of her  fine breasts, the tangle of dark curls between her legs, and contemplated her  future, turning from the mirror finally to slump to the floor, tears falling from  her eyes.  So many dreams made dust.</p><p>
  She tried to visualize, as she had so many times  before, the feel of Ranma’s hands on her skin, the gentle pleasures of his  touch, but she couldn’t.  Instead, the  visions shifted to a pair of gentle hands adorned with long painted nails, and  a pair of emerald green eyes looking at her, shining with a emotion so intense  she had no name for it.</p><p>
  Why wouldn’t the dragon girl get out of her mind?  What witchery had she cast on her in that  long moment when their eyes first met?</p><p>
  She had been so angry, so furious at Ranma and those  other fiancées, so bitter that he had refused to acknowledge her claims… Then  her eyes had met the Chinese girl’s. </p><p>
  And time had stopped.</p><p>
  For that long instant, she had forgotten her anger,  forgotten her revenge, forgotten everything at all, seeing something she still  had no words to explain.  Like images  overlaying one another, she had seen Zhu Shu as she had looked after she had  reverted to her uncursed form, and contained within her was the form of a  dragon so vast her mind refused to acknowledge it’s immensity, staring at her  through those golden eyes.  And in the  dragon’s upturned claw, she had seen…</p><p>
  Herself.  </p><p>
  But it had been the self she had always dreamed of  being, the Ukyo who could wear dresses, and pretty jewelry and makeup, the Ukyo  she had always felt Ranma had taken from her.</p><p>
  And she had somehow known that she was looking at  herself through the mirror of Zhu Shu’s eyes.   That this was the Ukyo Zhu Shu had seen when she looked at her.  Past the boy’s clothes, and the bandages, Zhu  Shu had seen her as a woman… a beautiful woman.  </p><p>
  And from that image of herself, strands of light had  interwoven throughout the vision of Zhu Shu, and she had known as well that the  girl was as much a part of her as her own soul.   She had known the very instant their eyes met that Zhu Shu’s life would  be entwined with hers…</p><p>
  Forever.</p><p>
  And some part of herself, some secret place in her  heart had finally felt complete.  She had  felt a link form in those few seconds, knew that the Chinese girl had a key to  a part of her that she had refused to admit existed.</p><p>
  And, unable to deal with the fact that she found Zhu  Shu almost irresistible, she had rejected it, she had turned and walked  away.  More than Akane and Shan Pu, more  than the abortive fight with Ranma, she had been walking away from Zhu Shu.</p><p>
  But she hadn’t escaped.</p><p>
  She sighed.  All  her life, she had concentrated on Ranma, dreamed about Ranma, fantasized about  Ranma… and now… at the lowest point she had ever been in her life… it had been  Zhu Shu who had reached out to her, who had lifted her from the depths of  despair and given her back the life she had been ready to throw away.</p><p>
  She hated it, hated her, hated how she felt about the  strange girl with the bottomless emerald eyes.</p><p>
  <em>SHE LIKED BOYS!!!</em></p><p>
  She laughed, recalling how many girls she’d chased off  over the years, but it came out sounding like a sob.  </p><p>
  The funny thing was that she couldn’t recall a single  boy she had ever liked enough to consider besides Ranma.  Even the few boys who had seen past her  masquerade and sought her attentions hadn’t caught her eye, and not all of them  had been as obsessive as the latest.  </p><p>
  And much as she wanted to hate Ranma for putting her  in this mess, she couldn’t.  It really  wasn’t his fault that she’d been forced to live a lie.  It had all been her father and Genma.</p><p>
  She held her head in her hands wishing the world would  make sense for once, that it would somehow finally let her find real happiness,  instead of throwing her this endless stream of practical jokes.</p><p>
  She rubbed her temples, trying to figure out what to  do.  Zhu Shu should be easy.  If she just treated her like a friend, and  told her that she wasn’t interested, she should eventually give up.  It had worked every other time a girl had  chased her, so there was no reason it wouldn’t work with the Chinese girl,  however strange Zhu Shu made her feel.</p><p>
  It had to work.   Somehow, she just had to overcome the butterflies in her stomach that  occurred whenever Zhu Shu was near, had to ignore the presence of the girl  within her mind.  She was a girl…  regardless of her father’s legal manipulations.   Somehow… she would find a way.</p><p>
  And Ranma?</p><p>
  She sighed heavily.   She wanted to be mad at him so badly, but she just couldn’t justify it  even to herself.  He was a victim of  circumstance.  Much as she wanted to deny  the fact and take him for herself, it had become obvious that he took his  current fiancées seriously… and that she had been wrong to think he was a  two-timer.  </p><p>
  And the two girls had made it quite plain that they  were perfectly happy with the arrangement.   She’d seen absolutely no sign that she could play one against the  other.  They were BOTH Ranma’s fiancée’s,  and that was that.</p><p>
  Damn her father for being so eager to marry her  off!  She’d known he wanted a boy, had  dressed her as a boy, and even raised her mostly as a boy, but the first chance  he had had to get rid of her, he’d jumped without even looking.  That had been the root of her misery ever since.  Her father refused to accept that he’d been a  fool, and blamed her.  She had to have  been at fault.  It was bad enough she had  had to endure the teasing of the girls in her neighborhood, but he had sworn  she would never be a woman until she had fulfilled the oath he had sworn that  she would marry Ranma.  He had burned her  dresses and ribbons, eliminated every sign she was a girl at all from his  life.  She had been enrolled in one boy’s  school after another, had her life twisted by her father’s obsession until she  had become consumed by it herself…</p><p>
  And it was all for naught.  There were no angles, no trump cards she  could play.  Nodoka’s words had made that  very clear.  Ranma was not, and never had  been, her fiancé.  Her entire life had  been shaped by a fantasy.</p><p>
  So what now?   She had been friends with Ranma for barely six months when they were  both children, and spent ten years hunting him.   It was clear he still thought of her as an old friend, and had been hurt  by her anger.  It was just as clear that  he ONLY thought of her as an old friend.   Her quest was at an end… permanently.</p><p>
  It would be easier to close down the restaurant before  it ever even had its grand opening and move somewhere else far away from her  shattered dreams…</p><p>
  But that little piece of her heart she didn’t want to  hear from told her that her place was here… that she was needed… and that she  couldn’t run away from the past…</p><p>
  …Or the future.</p><p>
  She finally stood up, giving herself a last look in  the mirror before going and grabbing her soda.   She finished it while rushing through her homework and finally crawled  into bed, where a pair of emerald green eyes haunted her dreams.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Rei tossed and turned, finally giving up and opening  her eyes to stare at the ceiling.  </p><p>
  She didn’t regret seducing Zhu Shu.  If anything, wonderful as the experience was,  and as eager as she was to play with Zhu Shu again, she’d felt strangely  unfulfilled, like something was missing.   It had been enormous fun, and she had finally answered several questions  in her mind, particularly in regards to her own personal tastes, but she’d  found herself feeling towards the end that…</p><p>
  She couldn’t put her finger on it, really.  Just a sense of incompleteness…</p><p>
  It was strange.   She didn’t want to give her Sensei up, no matter what she had said.  But at the same time, she wanted something  more…</p><p>
  She stood, feeling the cloth of her night gown rustle  softly against her skin as she went to the window and looked up at the Moon.</p><p>
  She sighed.    The problem was that she really did love Zhu Shu.  She’d never really felt that way about  anyone.  But as much as she wished Zhu  Shu could just to stay with her… it could never be.  Not only would Zhu Shu’s duties prevent it,  but her own family would never accept it.   It had been bad enough that she had asked to live at the shrine and become  a priestess, and that was far more acceptable to her family than it would be if  she proclaimed herself in love with another girl.</p><p>
  Would it have been better if Zhu Shu had never entered  her life?  Until the Chinese girl had  come along, the very idea of being in love with another girl had never crossed  her mind.  Sure, she had wondered what  sex would be like, and had even contemplated playing around with her  girlfriends if the opportunity arose, purely for experimental purposes, but  love?  </p><p>
  Well, she had certainly experimented, and discovered  that she rather liked it, but it wasn’t until they had been laying on the bed  cuddling afterwards that she had realized that she hadn’t seduced Zhu Shu out  of curiosity, but because she really wanted to express how much she loved the  little dragon girl.</p><p>
  She wasn’t lying about being happy that Zhu Shu had  found Ukyo, or being resigned to giving Zhu Shu up… she just hoped it was  awhile before she actually <em>had</em> too.  She wanted Zhu Shu to stay hers… if  only for little while longer.</p><p>
  Her fingers idly traced a pattern in the dust on the  window sill as she remembered the bombardment of questions from the other  girls.  Other than that brief bit with  Usagi, they had all seemed to take the fact that Rei had actually slept with Zhu  Shu as a mark of honor.  She’d been even  more surprised when Makoto had more or less admitted to having had her own  encounters with girls before, and that she wasn’t sure which she liked better.  She still wished that she had her old  boyfriend, but she wasn’t going to turn down having a girlfriend if she found  one she was really into.</p><p>
  Makoto still wouldn’t go into details as to exactly  what had happened at her old school, though Rei did know it had been St.  Hebereke’s, and that Makoto’s expression when hearing Kodachi’s name usually  verged on homicidal, but Makoto had admitted that being at an all girl’s school  had left her with a couple of girl to girl crushes over the years.  Ami still said she liked boys, but had never  really thought about it all that much. Mina had actually blushed and admitted  that she’d had more than one girl hit on her when she was on the set, and that  she didn’t mind it at all.  And Usagi had  of course claimed that all she ever thought about was Mamoru, despite the fact  that everyone had pointed out that she’d go starry eyed anytime a cute boy  would look at her.  </p><p>
  The fact that Rei had actually won Zhu Shu’s  attentions had meant far more to them than that they were both girls.  They all wanted their Sensei to be happy.</p><p>
  And that was the crux of it, really… She wanted Zhu  Shu to be happy too.  Whatever it took,  she wanted what was best for Zhu Shu…</p><p>
  Why couldn’t that be her?  Why did it have to be Ukyo?</p><p>
  She looked up at the moon, wishing it held the answers  she wanted, but the face, like always, was silent.</p><p>
  She turned from the window and yawned as she  stretched.  Sliding into the covers, she  thought about the things she had done with Zhu Shu, her hand sliding down to  between her legs as she brought herself to climax, the gentle fall from the  heights finally dropping her into sleep.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Morning dawned bright and early, and as Zhu Shu and  Nabiki prepared to leave for school, they found a smilodon once more waiting  for them.  Nabiki smiled, happy at  Tao-Ching’s return despite Zhu Shu’s melancholy mood.</p><p>
  “So, my fiancé is finally here?” She asked, mock  severely.  “After two days back?</p><p>
  Tao-Ching shrugged.   One huge paw scratched out “I had to settle some business payments, then  I got lost in some ward called New Detroit.”.</p><p>
  Nabiki shook her head.   “I’m gonna need a tracking collar for you, aren’t I?”</p><p>
  The big cat laughed.</p><p>
  They rode to school, Nabiki and Zhu Shu both being  quiet as Tao-Ching purred, but finally unable to take the depressive silence,  Nabiki asked a question.</p><p>
  “So, how long has Shan Pu been a cat?” she asked, her  voice holding a trace of amusement.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu blinked, the question snapping her out of her  morose mental wanderings.  “Cat?”</p><p>
  “Shan Pu.    She’s playing at being China,  isn’t she?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu raised eyebrow.  “Why ask.”</p><p>
  “Because this big idiot let slip that Shan Pu already  had a curse.  And I remember how upset  she was that Ranma had a fear of cats, even vowed to see Ranma cured of that  fear.”  Nabiki gave Zhu Shu a smile.  “Now, put two and two together.  Shan Pu must have a good reason to be upset  that Ranma fears cats, and the very next day, Akane is “given” a betrothal gift  of a cat, and made to promise she’ll help break Ranma of his fear.” She made  imaginary ticks on a mental board as she listed points.  “Now I don’t know Shan Pu anywhere near as  well as you, but I don’t think she’s <em>so</em> sentimental that she couldn’t have given the cat to someone else to take care  of and gotten Akane a different gift.   Put Tao-Ching’s slip that Shan Pu has a curse together with all of that,  ergo <em>Shan Pu</em> is the kitten in  question, and has a vested interest in curing her fiancée of a phobia to her  cursed form.”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching shook his head and they felt a rumble as he  laughed.  Zhu Shu smiled sadly.</p><p>
  “Shan Pu be cursed since thirteen.”  Zhu Shu admitted.  “Great Grandmother tell be cat.  Hope learn more about Akane so not chase  away.  Hope help Ranma not fear cat.”  She shook her head, the small bells in her  braids chiming softly.  “Zhu Shu not sure  is best course.  Not sure how Akane react  when find cat is fiancée, not sure how Ranma react if find out fiancée turn  into worst fear.”</p><p>
  Nabiki nodded.   “I can see where that might be problematic.  Does Kasumi know?”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   Nabiki shrugged.  “Well, I suppose  for now we’ll see how it goes, then.  I  have my own fiancé problems, like that fact that this idiot <em>STILL HASN’T TAKEN ME ON A DATE!”</em></p><p>
  That actually drew a giggle from Zhu Shu as they  continued onwards toward school, neither of them noticing the shadowy figure  that had stood up next to the phone pole they had just passed, rubbing his head  and contemplating the words he had just heard.  </p><p>
  “So, the defiler fears cats.  Wonderful.   I shall make his life a feline hell until he frees my love!”</p><p>
  Turning to stalk off dramatically, he ran smack into  the telephone pole again.  Picking  himself up, he grumbled as he searched around the ground until he found his  glasses, then laughing manically, he headed off towards the school as well.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ranma looked off towards the school and shook his  head.  Akane looked at him  curiously.  “What’s up?”</p><p>
  “Nothin’.  Just  a cold shiver.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu smiled.   “Old legend say when get shiver, someone plan evil to you.”</p><p>
  Ranma laughed.   “Maybe.  Wonder if Kuno’s up to  something?”</p><p>
  “If he is, you’ll just knock him unconscious again.”  Akane said.</p><p>
  Shan Pu laughed.   “He do have very strong head.”  </p><p>
  Ranma nodded.   “Hopefully he’s not bothering Zhu Shu today.  She’s doing a lot better than last night, but  she’s still upset over this Ukyo thing.   Hopefully Rei can cheer her up again today.”</p><p>
  Akane smiled.   “If it was anything like the cheering she did yesterday, I doubt Zhu Shu  will be very resistant.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu blinked and looked at the pair.  “What Shan Pu miss?”</p><p>
  Akane laughed.   “It seems our little priestess decided that the cheering Zhu Shu needed  yesterday was of the physical variety.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu smiled.   “Good.  Zhu Shu need  playtime.  Tried get play occasionally  two months chase Ranma.  Sister too  serious all time.  Come Japan be good  for her.”</p><p>
  Ranma rolled his eyes.   “You can say that again.  She’s  got a great sense for mischief, but it’s rare she shows it.  Rei’s been good for her.  I just hope this thing about Ukyo doesn’t  ruin it.”  He smacked his fist into  palm.  “If it’s the Dragon’s will or not,  if Ukyo is the one her tattoo is indicating, she better treat Zhu Shu right, or  old friend or not, there will be a reckoning.”</p><p>
  “I agree.” Akane said.   “But let’s wait and see how things go for just the first little bit,  okay?  Try not to let your temper get the  better of you.”</p><p>
  Ranma raised his eyebrow, but wisely held back the  comment about pots and kettles.</p><p>
  Then a chain shot down from a tree by the school gate  just in front of them, Ranma barely sensing it in time to dodge as the spiked  end gouged a line in the pavement before retracting with the same speed.  A second chain followed, then nearly a dozen  chains streaked out of the concealment.</p><p>
  Ranma managed to dodge most, but one caught his braid  and pulled him backwards, and before he could recover, five more had wrapped  themselves around him.  </p><p>
  “Mu Si!”  Shan  Pu yelled at the tree.  “You let Ai Ren  go now, or Shan Pu be <em>very</em> angry!”  She moved over towards the bound  boy as Akane’s swords cut through a chain that had come too close to her.</p><p>
  A tall boy clad in a long Chinese robe appeared, standing  on the branch of a tree, his long hair flowing down his back freely.  Huge glasses with incredibly thick lenses  covered his eyes, and the chains around Ranma emerged from within the sleeve of  his voluminous robe.</p><p>
  “I am sorry to have to do this, my love, but I must  free you from this hideous bondage!”   From out of his other sleeve a large clay pitcher flew towards Ranma.</p><p>
  Shan Pu’s bon buri appeared in her hands as, without  thinking, she went to bat the pitcher away…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Zhu Shu was dismounting from the back of the smilodon  as she heard Shan Pu yell from just outside the gate.  Tao-Ching, as usual, had gotten turned  around, and had ended up entering the school yard from over the wall next to  the school.  Nabiki had been having fun  berating the big cat, and Zhu Shu wasn’t entirely certain the few minutes of  wild ride had been an accident.</p><p>
  She was moving towards the sudden sound of combat,  when suddenly, there was the sound of something breaking, followed by a  surprised yowl, and a shriek from Ranma.   Dreading what she’d find, she ran out the gate.</p><p>
  Akane was staring, her swords out, and her ribbons  wrapped around a tall Chinese boy.  As  Zhu Shu followed her gaze, her heart sank.</p><p>
  Ranma lay on the ground, soaking wet and struggling to  try and get away while still wrapped in chains.   On her chest was the dress Shan Pu had been wearing, along with  scattered shards of pottery.  Shan Pu’s  bon buri lay to either side of her, but it was the wet, forlorn China setting  on Ranma’s chest, mewing apologetically that Akane’s eyes were fixed on.</p><p>
  “China?”  Akane said, softly.  The boy tried saying something, muffled  behind Akane’s ribbons.  Akane didn’t  even look down as she slammed her sword across the back of his head, making his  eyes roll up as he slumped, unconscious.   “<em>Shan Pu</em>?” Akane whispered.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu stepped forward to pick up the forlorn looking  kitten.  “Great Grandmother tell her be  pet for Akane.  Please not be angry with  Shan Pu.”  she said to the still stunned  girl.</p><p>
  Akane blinked.   “But… but… I thought… I thought she was in China?”  She shook her head, the long braid lashing  like a tail.  “No… she <em>was</em> China.”  she added.   “<em>AND SHE DIDN’T TELL ME!?!</em>”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu hid her sister behind her back.  “Great-grandmother tell her not to.”</p><p>
  Akane’s glare could have melted steel, and for one  long second, Zhu Shu was afraid Akane was about to try and chop Shan Pu into  sushi, regardless of if Zhu Shu was in the way or not.  Then she closed her eyes, and seemed to  deflate.  “Give her to me,  Zhu-chan.”  She sighed at Zhu Shu’s hesitancy.  “I’m <em>not</em> going to wring her neck, Zhu-chan.  I  promise.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu nosed over Zhu Shu’s shoulder and mewed.</p><p>
  “No, I won’t kill you.”  Akane said.   “But no more sleeping under my bed.”  </p><p>
  Shan Pu nodded.   She hopped down and gingerly stepped over to Akane, who picked her  up.  She held the kitten nose to  nose.  “However, you and I are going to  have a long talk later.”</p><p>
  “C-c-c-c-cat!”   Ranma finally managed to say.</p><p>
  Akane and Shan Pu both turned to look at her.  The red head had finally crawled out of her  chains and was pressed back to a phone pole. Akane sighed and looked at Zhu Shu  for help.</p><p>
  Zhu Shu produced her kettle, but looked over her  shoulder to the students gathered at the gate, attracted to the commotion.  Akane got a mischievous grin, and took the  kettle anyway.</p><p>
  “You deserve this, dear.”  She told the kitten as she poured the water  on her.</p><p>
  Shan Pu didn’t even flinch as she transformed.  She smiled.   “Shan Pu not mind if Ai Ren wish show off to school.” </p><p>
  Akane shook her head.   “I should have put two and two together.   I’ve been comparing you to a cat since we met.  And you’re as utterly shameless as one.”</p><p>
  “Why Shan Pu be ashamed of self?  Work hard make body pleasing to eye.”</p><p>
  Akane looked over to where most of the Hentai were  agreeing.  Their nosebleeds over the nude  Chinese girl certainly seemed to indicate their appreciation.  She picked up Shan Pu’s dress and tossed it  to her. Then turned to Ranma. “Is that better?”</p><p>
  The red head shook her head.  “No!   She turns into a CAT!”</p><p>
  Shan Pu sighed as her shoulders slumped.  “Please, not be angry with Shan Pu.  She not help be cursed.  Musk Prince throw off cliff into Jusenkyo  when thirteen.”</p><p>
  “<em>BUT YOU’RE A  CAT!</em>”</p><p>
  “And RANMA IS <em>GIRL!</em>”  Shan Pu shouted back.  “Shan Pu not help be cat!  She play pet try get Ranma not scared!”</p><p>
  “But why didn’t you tell me!”</p><p>
  Shan Pu hung her head.   “Shan Pu is sorry.  Great  Grandmother say try to cure work better if not know.”  She tried to step towards Ranma, but the red  head scurried back behind the pole.  Shan  Pu sighed, then turned and started trudging towards the school. </p><p>
  Akane gave the red haired girl a sour look.  “Well, I don’t know about you, but I’m going  in to class.”  She yanked her ribbons  free, sending the unconscious Chinese boy rolling along the ground, then turned  her back on Ranma and walked into the gate.</p><p>
  Ranma looked at Zhu Shu.  “What?   You gonna be upset at me too?  I  only promised I’d try to learn to live with a cat!  I never said I’d marry one!”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu noted how her voice had gone up several  octaves as she spoke, ending in a near shriek, and realized there was no  talking to the near hysterical girl.   Being tied up with a cat sitting on her had nearly driven her into the  Neko-ken, and until she calmed down…</p><p>
  She sighed as she turned to follow the others.</p><p>
  Ranma remained against the pole, taking deep breaths  as she tried to get her heart to stop hammering, tried to forget the claws, the  fangs, the horrible hot breath…</p><p>
  She got glomped.  </p><p>
  “Oh, Shan Pu!   I’ve rescued you from that defiler!”</p><p>
  Ranma looked at the Chinese boy clutching her and  growled.</p><p>
  “<em>LET GO OF ME,  YOU PERVERT!</em>” she screamed as she booted the boy into an arc that ended  with him crashing into a wall.  The wall  crumbled and the building attached collapsed on the boy with a satisfying roar.</p><p>
  She shrugged and cracked her neck, the brief outbreak  of anger having provided an outlet to the adrenaline surge her fear had  caused.  Then she turned to find Ke Lun  standing in front her.  She paled.</p><p>
  “Rash words Son-in-law.  Be glad Shan Pu did not hear you.”</p><p>
  Ranma frowned.   “You could have told me!”</p><p>
  “You reaction now is proof of why I didn’t.  Had you known, you would have shied away from  her as you just did.  I had hoped to  reduce your fear first.  I shall be  having a long talk with yon idiot.”</p><p>
  “I am not an idiot, Warleader!  How could you have betrothed my love to this  defiler!”  the Chinese boy yelled,  pushing aside the rubble that covered him.    He stood and dusted himself off and reached into his robe.  “I vowed I would find her a cure!  And I have!   Behold, Nannichuan!” He held up a small wooden cask.</p><p>
  Ke Lun sighed.   “Mu Si, you are a fool, as I told you when you set out on this  quest.  You are a fool still.  Shan Pu has rejected you time and time again,  yet still you persist in hounding her.   Must I exile you before you will cease?”</p><p>
  “B-but… but I have the cure!”</p><p>
  Ke Lun hopped over behind him and swatted him upside  the head with her staff, knocking him down as she retrieved the cask.  “Fool indeed.   Had you spilled this, you would now be female.”  She poked Mu Si in the chest.  “You are a lucky boy to have even braved the  springs and escaped untouched.”</p><p>
  Mu Si just blinked myopically.  “But, elder.   The cure?”</p><p>
  Ke Lun made the cask disappear, and pulled out a flask  of water.  She gave Mu Si back his  glasses and poured it on herself.  Mu Si  blinked at the much taller and younger bunny girl Ke Lun had become.</p><p>
  “This is what you would curse Shan Pu to become, Mu  Si.  She would no longer be a cat, true,  but neither would she have escaped being a cat.”</p><p>
  “Elder?”</p><p>
  “Your fool quest had you far from our village when the  Musk attacked, and when half our warriors were turned to rabbits.  We have tried your “cure”, boy.  Had you bothered to ask, we could have told  you it would not work before you even began to quest.  You have spent four months discovering what  the elders could have told you in four seconds!”</p><p>
  Mu Si cringed.   “But… Shan Pu?”</p><p>
  “Shan Pu is married!   As per Amazon law!  She was  defeated in fair combat in an accepted challenge match.  She is not now, nor ever has been for you.”</p><p>
  Mu Si turned eyes burning with hatred on Ranma.  “Then I challenge you!  I challenge you for…”</p><p>
  “You can’t have Shan Pu, Mu Si.  Ranma is her husband” Ke Lun said in a tone  that brooked no challenge.  Mu Si paled  and thought frantically.  </p><p>
  “Then if you have stolen my love, I shall steal  yours!  I challenge you for…</p><p>
  “You can’t have Akane Tendo either, Mu Si.  She has defeated Shan Pu in fair combat as  well and accepted her as a Sister-Wife.”   Ke Lun said.</p><p>
  Mu Si turned an interesting shade of purple.  “Then I will destroy you, Defiler!  You have stolen my dreams and ruined my  hopes!  As you have stolen my life, so  shall I take yours!  I will hound you  till the day you die!”</p><p>
  “How ‘bout we settle this right now?”  Ranma asked.   “I beat the tar out of you and you go away.”</p><p>
  “You have school right now Ranma.  And you have only a few minutes before you  are late.”  Ke Lun said.  “This fool has already wasted too much time,  and I have words I need to have with you.   If you wish to fight, do it after school.” </p><p>
  Ranma cracked her knuckles.  “Fine.   After school it is.”</p><p>
  “Agreed.” Mu Si said.   “Enjoy your day, defiler!  It  shall be your last!”  Mu Si turned and  stalked off.</p><p>
  Ranma turned with a growl, preparing to get some hot  water before class, but Ke Lun poked her with her stick.  “Don’t think I am done with you,  Son-in-law.  You have much to learn, not  the least of which is your duty.  Think  about things that can not be changed, and when you are ready to admit your  folly, apologize to Shan Pu for shunning her and shaming her in front of your  countrymen.”</p><p>
  “Whatever.  I  got enough problems to deal with now, old woman.  That idiot turned me into a girl in front of  the whole school, so now they all know!”</p><p>
  Ke Lun raised an eyebrow.  “So foolish.   Go to school, Ranma.  You’ll learn  your lesson soon enough.”</p><p>
  Ranma pushed past her, and looked at all the Hentai  still blocking the gate and drooling over Ke Lun’s bunny girl form.  “Move already!  I gotta get some hot water!”</p><p>
  Hiroshi and Daisuke blinked from their comatose  drooling stare and looked at Ranma.   “Water?  Hot water?  Like Zhu Shu?   You mean you turn into a hot babe and you’ve been hiding it all this  time?”</p><p>
  “Idiots.  Keep  your hands to yourselves or I’ll break them.”</p><p>
  “But… but Gym… showers…”  They lurched forward, zombie-like.</p><p>
  “Aw, screw this!”   Ranma said and leaped up, running across the crowd of lust induced  zombies by stepping from head to head.   She cleared the crowd and landed, looking up to find she was blocked by  Ai.</p><p>
  “What do you want?”</p><p>
  Ai gave her a long look, one that made Ranma feel like  she was being sized up for dinner.   “Nothing… for now.”</p><p>
  Sighing, Ranma dodged around her and into the school,  heading for the janitor’s closet just inside, and the hot water tap.  Ai watched as the door closed.</p><p>
  A few minutes passed, with a couple of muffled yelps  coming from the closet, then a still female Ranma emerged from the closet.</p><p>
  “<em>KE LUN!</em>”</p><p>
  Ai looked back over the crowd of boys to where the  black eared bunny girl still stood, just in time to see her laugh before  turning and walking away.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Akane blinked as a still female Ranma came into the  class room just seconds before the bell rang.   The teacher looked at her and blinked.</p><p>
  “May I help you, young lady?”</p><p>
  “Give me a break.   It’s me, Ranma.  Ranma  Saotome?  I would have thought that with  Zhu Shu the dragon girl and my bunny girl fiancée you’d have figured out I got  cursed too!”</p><p>
  The teacher adjusted his glasses.  “Interesting.   Two of you arriving as girls today.   Very well, young lady, take your seat.”</p><p>
  Ranma blinked, then her eyes searched across the room,  to finally settle on Ukyo, looking much more feminine with her hair down and  her over-shirt parted slightly to reveal her cleavage, sans bandages.  </p><p>
  And right next to her was the only still free seat in  the class.  Right between her and  Akane.  Ranma sighed.  Life was certainly conspiring against her  today.</p><p>
  She slumped in her seat, as the teacher started  writing on the board.  Akane looked at  her and hissed softly.  “Why are you  still a girl?”</p><p>
  “Stupid Ke Lun was watching the fight.  She did somethin’ to me, cause I got upset  that Shan Pu’s a c-c-cat!  I can’t  change!  I can’t even touch lukewarm  water, because it’s scalding!”</p><p>
  Akane raised her eyebrow.  “Well, you did sort of over-react.  I mean, she can’t help being a cat any more  than you can help being a girl.”</p><p>
  “You’re one to talk.   She’s been playing your pet!”</p><p>
  Akane nodded.   “Oh trust me.  Shan-chan has a bit  to answer for there.  But I have my  revenge planned out for her already.”</p><p>
  “Yeah, well.   She’s still a c-c-cat!”</p><p>
  “And our <em>fiancée</em>.  Ranma.  I don’t know about you, but I’ve  been coming to realize I have an obligation to live up to my promises.  And Shan Pu is one of my promises.”</p><p>
  “Yeah, but I didn’t promise to marry a c-c-c-cat!”</p><p>
  “No.  You  promised to marry Shan Pu when you accepted the betrothal.”</p><p>
  “Like I had a choice!”</p><p>
  “Yes, you did.   You could have refused!  But you  didn’t!  You went along with it, and you  promised in front of my family and yours to marry Shan Pu and honor the  alliance between our clans!”</p><p>
  “You’re one to talk, you fought tooth and nail with me  over marrying me!  You fought with your  father about accepting the betrothal, with me, with everyone!”</p><p>
  “And there’s a difference.  I didn’t promise to marry you until  later!  Now that I have, have you seen me  fighting it?  I made the promise to Shan  Pu, and her Great Grandmother, and the Amazons.   As did you!”</p><p>
  Ranma sank into her seat in a pout.  “I ain’t marrying no c-c-cat!”</p><p>
  Akane glared.   “I see why Ke Lun stuck you as a girl then.”  She turned back to the board and began  studiously ignoring the red-head.</p><p>
  Ranma looked over at Ukyo at the sound of a muffled  laugh, but the girl was also looking forward studiously, but unable to hide the  grim amusement in her eyes.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Lunch time found Akane setting under a tree with Shan  Pu, while Ranma was nowhere to be found, which suited Akane just fine at the  moment.  She’d gotten more than fed up  with her pouting in first period.</p><p>
  Shan Pu on the other hand had been apologetic, even  going so far as to make Akane lunch in her home ec class, and serving it to her  bite by bite.  Akane had been allowing  her to have her fun while waiting for Zhu Shu to get back with her little  “revenge”</p><p>
  As Shan Pu was feeding her the last little bit of pork  with her chopsticks, the dragon girl fluttered in for a landing and handed  Akane a package.  “Get many strange looks  at place Nabiki send.  Asked if want make  movie.”</p><p>
  “I’m sorry, Zhu-chan.”   She sat up and unwrapped the package.   “Now, Shan-kitty, dear?”</p><p>
  Shan Pu blinked, “Yes, Ai Ren?”</p><p>
  “I just want you to know, I’m not going to blame you  for not telling me, or sleeping under my bed, after all, you could have slept <em>in </em>the bed with me, and you didn’t.  I do give you credit for <em>mostly</em> not abusing my trust that you were my kitty.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu nodded.   “Shan Pu just want try learn more about Akane.”</p><p>
  Akane nodded.   “And that’s good.   And it’s  because of that and the fact that you were only doing what your Grandmother  ordered that I’m not mad.”  Akane gave  her a half lidded, almost seductive look.   “But there <em>is</em> one question I  do want to ask.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu blinked, uncertain what to make of Akane’s  tone.  “Yeees, Ai Ren?”</p><p>
  “Did you enjoy watching me play with Ranma?”</p><p>
  Shan Pu blushed a deep crimson.  “Um… Shan Pu… um…”</p><p>
  “Yes, or no, dear.”   Akane tapped her head where her bunny ears were in her cursed form.  “I heard you purring, so I already know the  answer, but I <em>want</em> to hear it from <em>you</em>.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu blushed even brighter as she looked down.  “Yes.   Shan Pu enjoy watching Ai Ren’s pleasure each other.”  She gave Akane a look from under her lowered  eyelids that smoldered softly.  “Shan Pu  wish could be with Ai Ren’s instead of just watch.”</p><p>
  Akane smiled.   “Good.”  She opened the package  and pulled out a soft velvet choker collar, with a silver buckle and a heart shaped  charm.  “But if you’re going to be my pet  Shan-kitty, then you certainly need a proper collar.  After all, if you’re not tagged properly,  someone might just try to steal you.”   Akane’s grin grew sultry as she leaned forward so she was nose to nose  with Shan Pu.  “I certainly don’t intend  to do without my favorite bundle of purrs.” she said as she slipped the collar  around the Amazon’s neck.</p><p>
  Shan Pu was stock still as Akane finished buckling the  collar, hardly daring to breathe as her lips trembled mere inches from  Akane’s.  Her violet eyes remained locked  on Akane’s face as the other girl smoothed the soft velvet collar.  Finally, Akane’s eyes looked back up to meet  hers.</p><p>
  “And now... the whole world will know you’re <em>mine</em>.”   Akane said.</p><p>
  Shan Pu’s heart nearly stopped with the implications  of Akane’s words, and as Akane started to pull back, a small mew of protest  escaped her lips.  Akane smiled and  leaned forward again.</p><p>
  As their lips met, Shan Pu felt like a small star had  ignited in her.  The world around her  slipped away as a current like an electric storm coursed through her.  For a long eternity, it felt like an icy wind  coursed across her skin as a warm fountain poured through her soul. As Akane  pulled back, Shan Pu leaned forward, not wanting the kiss to stop, her lips  still seeking Akane’s.  She caught  herself as she was about to fall over, her eyes opening to see Akane’s pleased  smile.</p><p>
  “Humm, two for two on stunned reactions to my first  kiss.”</p><p>
  Zhu Shu chuckled.   “Akane use technique learns from Zhu Shu.  Chi kiss. “</p><p>
  Shan Pu sighed happily.  “Ai Ren kiss wonderfully.”</p><p>
  Akane raised an eyebrow.  “Okay… I had no idea.”</p><p>
  “Is okay.  Akane  use much she learns from link.  Not  realize.”</p><p>
  “Shan Pu not complain.”</p><p>
  Akane gave her a sultry look.  “Good.   Now look at your tag.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu lifted the heart shaped tag and tilted her  head awkwardly.  “Shan-kitty.  Property Akane Tendo?”</p><p>
  “Yep.”  Akane’s  tone was highly amused.</p><p>
  Shan Pu looked back up in time to see Akane raise the  squirt gun and fire, then came the usual wrenching shift.  She crawled out of her dress and looked up at  Akane.  “Mew?”</p><p>
  Akane patted her lap.   “I told you, I’m not giving up my favorite bundle of purrs.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu smiled and jumped into Akane’s lap, happily  surrendering herself to the ecstasy of Akane’s fingers.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ranma watched Akane and Shan Pu from the roof of the  school while Akane gave the Amazon a kiss.   A small flash of jealousy sparked for just a second before her  conscience squashed it.  What right did  she have to be jealous?  Akane was right,  his fiancée had promised to try and love Shan Pu as much as the Amazon loved  her.</p><p>
  And, much as she hated to admit it, so had she.  While it was true her mother had rushed her  into it, and her grandfather had set it up, she’d been the one making the  promise as she sat in front of the assemblage.   She had sworn on her honor to uphold the alliance and Amazon law.</p><p>
  “It’s not easy, is it?”  Ukyo said from behind her.</p><p>
  Ranma looked over to the girl, half expecting her to  have her spatula out to brain her.  “What?”</p><p>
  “Promises and honor.”   She came and sat on the edge of the roof with Ranma.  “I spent the entirety of last night thinking  about it.  And betrayal of promises.”</p><p>
  “Look Ukyo, I’m sorry I can’t marry you…”</p><p>
  “It’s not <em>your</em> fault, Ranma.  It’s your father’s… and  mine.  I’ve been contemplating exactly  how I’m going to maim him for getting me into this mess, but I can’t really  blame <em>you</em>.  Like you said, you didn’t know.  My life is ruined, but it’s not your  fault.”  She shrugged.  “I even thought about killing myself.  I might have even done it if your strange  friend hadn’t talked to me yesterday.   Kami knows, it looked like the only available option.  My father’s vow won’t let him see me as a  girl.  Your fathers promise was  meaningless.  My own vow to make you pay  for leaving me is meaningless.   Everything I have spent the last ten years striving for is  meaningless.  What did I have to live  for?”  Ukyo laughed bitterly.  “Then that damned dragon girl had to come and  tell me about losing her first love, and how she tried to commit suicide, and  how she finally learned life can give you second chances.  So here I am… waiting to see if she’s right.”</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu tried to commit suicide?”  Ranma shook his head.  “I never knew that.  I knew Ying-Ying had died, and Zhu Shu had a  hard time dealing with her death…” he looked at the dragon girl.  “I wonder if Akane knows.”</p><p>
  “So her lover <em>was</em> female.”  Ukyo said.  “ I suspected, but really wasn’t sure.  Not really my thing you know.  Really hoping I can find some solution to this  being stuck legally as a guy before I’m forced to marry a girl.”</p><p>
  Ranma looked at her sidelong.  “It’s really not bad at all.  Rather enjoyable in fact.  Once I get married, I’ll be able to compare  both ways, but I can certainly say as a girl that I enjoy it.”</p><p>
  Ukyo raised an eyebrow.  “Humm.   Don’t know, Ranma.  I’ve always  kinda visualized being with <em>you</em>.”</p><p>
  Ranma sighed.   “Sorry.”</p><p>
  “So you’re scared of cats?” </p><p>
  Ranma blinked at the change in subject.   “Um… yeah, you could say that.  My idiot dad threw me in a pit full of hungry  cats wrapped up in fish sausage.”</p><p>
  Ukyo stared at her in shock.  “You’re kidding, right?”</p><p>
  Ranma sighed.   “I wish I was.  Every time I’m  near a cat, I just get overwhelmed with the memories of them clawing, and  scratching and gnawing on me.”  She  shuddered.  “And Akane’s right.  I promised to take Shan Pu as my wife.”</p><p>
  “And here I am griping about getting forced to marry a  girl.  <em>You’re</em> stuck with your worst fear.”   Ukyo shook her head.  “Wanna run  off and elope?”</p><p>
  Ranma gave her a sour look.  “I can’t Uc-chan.  Running away is a coward’s way out.”</p><p>
  “Just kidding, Ranma.   Trying to lighten the mood.  Not  sure why I even came up here.  By rights,  I should hate you.”</p><p>
  “Do you?”</p><p>
  Ukyo looked at her for a long moment.  “I should.   I just can’t seem to though.  I  mean, hearing you this morning, I was overjoyed to hear you having problems…  then my conscience started fussing at me.”</p><p>
  Ranma put her head in her hands.  “Yeah.   Mine too.”</p><p>
  “Wish you hadn’t said what you said, huh?”</p><p>
  Ranma nodded.   “I’ve been told I let my mouth run away with me.”</p><p>
  “You always did.   You were always so cocky when you were stealing okonomiyaki.  But you were just too good for me to beat  you.  Now, even after ten years of  training for fighting you, I still can’t beat you.  You can afford to be cocky, I guess.  Your skills can back your mouth up.”</p><p>
  Ranma sighed.   “Yeah.  But it’s not something I’m  proud of.”</p><p>
  Ukyo laughed.   “I guess that means there’s hope for you yet.”</p><p>
  Ranma smiled.   “It’s good to have you back, Uc-chan.”</p><p>
  Ukyo shrugged.   “Hey, I can’t hate you, I can’t beat the tar out of you, and I can’t  marry you.  I guess if I’m ever gonna  have any part of you at all, it might as well be as friends.”</p><p>
  “I’m still weirded out that you’re a girl.”</p><p>
  “You’re weirded out?   Trust me, Ranma; you ain’t got nothing on me.  You turn female, one of your fiancées turns  into a playboy bunny, the other into a cat, and one of your friends flies  around looking like a hentai manga dragon girl, and I suspect <em>she</em> has a crush on me.  I’m just a plain old ordinary <em>tomboy</em>.”</p><p>
  Ranma laughed ruefully.  “Yeah, I guess my life <em>is</em> pretty crazy.”  She stuck  out her hand.  “Friends again?”</p><p>
  Ukyo took her hand and shook it.  “Friends.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The rest of the day went pretty quietly.  Ranma was excused from gym once the teacher  verified she couldn’t change back to male, since he couldn’t send her to the  female’s dressing room, and knew the havoc that would result sending her into  the male’s.  She’d had to sit and watch  from the sidelines as Akane and Shan Pu played softball.  </p><p>
  Of course, by the end of the day, everybody had known  about the impending fight, and that Ranma was stuck in female form.  Hoping to see yet another fight resulting in  a display of female anatomy, the Hentai Squad was out in force.</p><p>
  Ranma wasn’t co-operating though.  She’d shown up wearing more than her usual  Chinese shirt and pants, her outfit having had a heavy leather tunic added to  it.  She wasn’t giving a free show if she  could help it, regardless of how loud the hentai groaned when she walked out  onto the athletic field.</p><p>
  Ke Lun had gotten into the spirit of the show  though.  Ranma had blinked on seeing the  elder in her cursed form, wearing a playboy bunny outfit, complete with collar  and cuffs as she stood in the center of the ring.  At either corner two younger girls, one with  red hair, one with green, stood by with bon buri.</p><p>
  Shan Pu had been conscripted by her Grandmother, and  was walking up and down the stands with a tray filled with cups of ramen.  She waved at Ranma as she walked by.  “Be careful, Ai Ren.  Mu Si master hidden weapon technique.  Very dangerous.”</p><p>
  Ranma nodded, doing her best to shove the memories of  Shan Pu setting on her chest, mewing, out of her mind.  She looked around the ring.</p><p>
  Akane and Zhu Shu sat next to the ring on one side,  and almost directly across, Ukyo sat, avoiding Zhu Shu’s eyes.  She gave Ranma a thumb’s up.  Zhu Shu watched her, sighing softly before  lowering her eyes, Akane merely gave her a raised eyebrow.  Ranma sighed as she stepped up to the  ring.  Glad as she was that Ukyo had  decided to be a friend again, there were so many complications.   Including the one that she could solve  immediately.  She wore a small smile of  anticipation as she turned to the ring.</p><p>
  Mu Si stood impassively in one corner of the ring  frowning as Ke Lun strutted around the ring with a large sign proclaiming “Mu  Si vs. Ranma” in large kanji.   Ranma  jumped into the ring and looked at the scantily clad elder.  </p><p>
  “Ain’t you wearing just a little too little, old  woman?” she asked.</p><p>
  Ke Lun gave him a look.  “Show some respect, Son-in-law.  I’m having fun.  It’s been centuries since I last had men  throwing themselves at my feet.”</p><p>
  Ranma sighed.   “So we here to fight or what?”</p><p>
  Ke Lun tossed the sign away into the crowd , were  several hentai tore it to shreds trying to gain possession of it.  She pulled a mike out and tapped it to get  their attention.</p><p>
  “Ladies and gentlemen!   We are here to see a challenge match between Mu Si, the Joketsuzoku  Master of Hidden Weapons, vs. Ranma, the currently female Master of Anything  Goes!  At stake, Mu Si’s idiotic vow to  make Ranma’s life hell because of a woman he couldn’t have anyway!”</p><p>
  “Hey!”  Mu Si  objected.  Ke Lun batted him upside the  head with her stick.</p><p>
  “The rules of the match!  Contestants are expected to not kill or maim  one another!  Winner shall be when one  contestant can no longer fight!”</p><p>
  Ranma cracked her knuckles.  “This will be a piece of cake.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun laughed and leaped out of the ring, landing  with a flourish on the announcer’s table.   “Begin!”</p><p>
  Mu Si had barely waited for the call before he  launched a flight of darts at Ranma.  She  blinked and dodged, grabbing them before they went out of the ring into the  crowd.  “Hey, watch it!  You could hurt someone!”</p><p>
  Mu Si laughed.   “Hurt!  I shall do far worse than  hurt you!  I shall humiliate you!  For the shame you have brought to my love, my  Shan Pu!”</p><p>
  “Shan Pu no belong to Mu Si!”  Shan Pu called from the sidelines.  “Shan Pu belong Akane and Ranma!”  She touched the heart shaped tag attached to  her collar with a happy smile.  </p><p>
  Mu Si fumed.   “How dare you collar my Shan Pu!”   He launched a volley of chains at Ranma, but the red headed girl wasn’t  there anymore.  Mu Si looked upwards just  in time to see Ranma’s foot before it collided with his face.</p><p>
  “How dare you turn me into a girl in front of the  entire school!” Ranma said as she landed.  </p><p>
  Mu Si rolled over and rose to his hands and  knees.  “I will dare far more,  defiler!  Attack of the Unsure  Foot!”  </p><p>
  Mu Si rose to his knees and swung his arms in an arc,  ball bearings pouring out in a flood.   Ranma, having jumped to avoid another chain, cursed as her feet landed  on the small iron balls and flew out from under her.  </p><p>
  Mu Si seemed to be having no trouble.  With a yell of “Attack of the Violent  Petunia!” he had pulled a large flower pot out of his sleeves and brought it  crashing down, narrowly missing Ranma’s head.</p><p>
  Unfortunately, the jerk to move out of the way had  sent Ranma spinning across the ring.  As  she was struggling for purchase, another of Mu Si’s chains hooked into the top  of her leather tunic, and her momentum caused it to rip downwards.  Ranma caught herself at the edge of the ring  by grabbing the rope, and flipped herself to the corner pole.</p><p>
  “You jerk!”  She  yelled, surveying the damage.  She wasn’t  exposed, but the cut ran all the way down to her navel.  </p><p>
  She looked back up in time to see another of Mu Si’s  chains.  It hooked around her neck, and  as she grabbed it to keep from choking, he yanked her off the pole with a “Come  here!”</p><p>
  Ranma managed to twist just enough so that she avoided  the spear that had emerged from Mu Si’s other sleeve, but the loud rip let her  know it wasn’t by much.  She used her  momentum to swing around Mu Si, but she slipped on the ball bearings.</p><p>
  The results were extremely satisfying though, as her  inertia caused her to spin around Mu Si and not only free her, but wrap the  chain around the Chinese boy.</p><p>
  She grinned as she held onto the rope for balance and  yanked.  “Spinning Top Attack!”</p><p>
  Mu Si crashed into the far rope, the spin leaving him  glassless and dizzy.  Shakily he reached  into his sleeve and pulled out a… Chicken?</p><p>
  Ranma blinked as Mu Si raised the chicken and with a  cry of “Flying Egg of Death!” he squeezed several eggs out of the chicken,  hurling them in a wave in Ranma’s general direction.</p><p>
  In shock at the weirdness of the attack, Ranma didn’t  move in time, and one of the eggs exploded at her feet in a fireball.</p><p>
  Akane screamed her name as the wave of fire engulfed  her, and Ranma let out a howl of pain.   As the fireball burned out, she stood revealed, singed but otherwise  unharmed, though her top had shredded into uselessness.  </p><p>
  “Do you have any idea how much that hurts when you’re  hypersensitive to heat!” she yelled, finally able to keep her footing as the  explosions had cleared out most of the ball bearings.</p><p>
  “It is only the beginning of the pain I shall bring  you for defiling my Shan Pu!”  Mu Si said  as he launched a kick at the corner pole and followed it with a flurry of  punches.  </p><p>
  Ranma blinked, then walked over to the furiously  attacking boy and tapped him on the shoulder.  </p><p>
  “Yo, jerk!  I’m  over here.”</p><p>
  Mu Si paused, blinking myopically at Ranma.  With a growl of frustration, he reached into  his sleeve again.  Ranma decided enough  was enough, and grabbed Mu Si’s robe.  As  the Chinese boy drew forth a large round object, Ranma yanked.</p><p>
  “I think I’m tired of your tricks!”  she yelled as with a rip, Mu Si’s robe tore  free, leaving the blind boy as bare chested as she had ended up.</p><p>
  The girls in the crowd cooed at the muscular physique  Ranma’s move had revealed, glad that finally, some male cheesecake had been  exposed.  A few cheered for Ranma to rip  the rest of his clothes off.  Then Ai  assembled her team and they started cheering for both combatants to get naked.</p><p>
  Ranma did her best to ignore them as Mu Si seemed to  shrug off the loss of his robe.</p><p>
  “So, you want to settle this in a contest of skill  alone?  So be it!  I shall kill you with my own hands!”  </p><p>
  With that challenge, Mu Si hurled down the round  object, shattering it.  A large cloud of  smoke poured out of the shards, filling the ring with thick choking smoke.  Ranma fought to control his coughs as he  tried to listen for Mu Si over the sound of the disappointed spectators.  A slight sound was all she caught as he emerged  out of the smoke and attacked.</p><p>
  Once more, she barely dodged the lightning fast  attack, feeling cold metal brush past her skin, but the near miss cost her her  pants.  She had to rip them free as the  cut waist band dropped them around her ankles.</p><p>
  However a gust of wind blew the cloud of smoke away  and caught her standing there, stark naked.   She blinked at Ukyo, who was using her spatula as a giant fan.  Ranma blinked as the girl’s eyes traveled  down her body, and then stopped moving, a small smile growing on Ukyo’s face.</p><p>
  “Cute heart.”</p><p>
  Ai poked her head over Ukyo’s shoulder, giving the red  head a lascivious grin.  “I agree.”</p><p>
  Ranma blinked at both of them as a blush spread from  her hairline down towards her toes.</p><p>
  Then Ukyo yelled “Watch out!”</p><p>
  Ranma turned just in time to catch Mu Si’s arm, and  she ripped the claws off his hand.  “What  ever happened to settling this on skill!” she screamed as she tossed the boy  back across the ring.</p><p>
  Mu Si righted himself and looked in Ranma’s general  direction.  “I am Mu Si!  The Master of Hidden Weapons!  My weapons are my body!”  He threw out his arm in Ranma’s direction.</p><p>
  Ranma dodged out of the way, feeling something small  whistle by her.  Mu Si pulled his arm  back and Ranma watched a cheerleading outfit sail past him.  She turned to look at Ai, who was standing  there as naked as she was.</p><p>
  “Hey!”  Ai  yelled.  “I’m all for exhibitionism,  fella, but I like it at my choice!”  She  struck a dramatic pose as she showed off.   “Squad!  Pom-pom retaliation  Attack!”</p><p>
  Ranma dove for the cheerleading outfit as Mu Si was  bombarded with exploding pom-poms.  She  managed to pull the oversized sweater over herself as Mu Si emerged from the  cloud of smoke, his clothes every bit as tattered as Ranma’s had been.</p><p>
  The Furinkan girls cheered at finally getting to see a  guy mostly naked, but booed when Ranma tossed Ai’s skirt and Mu Si’s glasses at  the Chinese boy.  Mu Si caught the items  and looked at them dumbly.</p><p>
  “For Kami’s sake, cover yourself.”  She yelled.   “Nobody wants to see that!”</p><p>
  Ranma found herself pelted with a variety of objects  by the girls who seemed to be objecting that they did <em>indeed</em> want to see that.  She  shielded herself from the debris as Mu Si put on his glasses and looked at the  skirt.</p><p>
  “Why would I wear this!”</p><p>
  Shan Pu tossed a bucket of water at him.  “Idiot!”</p><p>
  Mu Si tried to move, but it was entirely too  late.  The water poured over him.</p><p>
  Silence descended on the field as everyone looked at  the soaked boy… who was no longer a boy.</p><p>
  Mu Si stood dripping, revealed as a slender feminine  version of himself… with a pair of large white wings sprouting from her  back.  Ranma blinked.</p><p>
  “So, boy.  You  were even more of a fool than I thought.   How many pools <em>DID</em> you fall  into?”  Ke Lun asked.</p><p>
  Mu Si turned to look at the elder.  “Two.   I fell into a pool and became a duck, and was nearly eaten, then was led  by the guide to the pool I retrieved water for Shan Pu from.  I slipped and fell into it while filling the  cask.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun fixed Mu Si with a hard stare.  “So you <em>knew</em> that your cure would not work, yet you attempted it anyway.”</p><p>
  Mu Si gave Ke Lun a defiant glare.  “She would at least have still been more than  a cat!  I have seen her suffer for  years!  The quiet looks, the pity!  She is the most beautiful woman in out  village and yet she has no-one who seeks her hand but me!  I could not stand it!  She has suffered because of what was done to  her!”</p><p>
  Shan Pu sighed.   “Mu Si.  Shan Pu have no suitors  because <em>Mu Si </em>no leave alone.  Make Shan Pu no want boys hang over, seek  favors.  Shan Pu teach other boys leave  alone!  But not Mu Si.  No matter how many times she tell Mu Si go  away, he no listen!  She beat him, he no  listen!  Shan Pu no want Mu Si, <em>HE NO LISTEN!</em>”  She was shaking in her fury.  “Now try make Shan Pu a cat girl whether she  wish or no?”</p><p>
  Mu Si backed away.   “I was only trying to help!”</p><p>
  “You no help!   You interfere in Shan Pu relationship with Ai Ren!  Mu Si upset Shan Pu Husband!”</p><p>
  Ranma blinked. Husband?  She shook her head as she continued watching  the angry Amazon.</p><p>
  “Shan Pu have enough!   She done with Mu Si!  She done  with interference!  Mu Si leave Shan Pu  no choice!”  </p><p>
  Mu Si blinked, her large eyes made even larger behind  the glasses.  “What… what are you  saying?”</p><p>
  Shan Pu just shook her head.  “Mu Si.   Shan Pu have tried asking, Shan Pu have tried making understand.  Now Shan Pu must settle once and for  all.  Mu Si, <em>Shan Pu turn back on you!</em>”</p><p>
  With all the deliberateness of a ceremony, Shan Pu  turned away from the nearly nude, winged girl.</p><p>
  Ke Lun looked at Shan Pu.  “There is no revoking this, child.  Are you certain?”</p><p>
  Shan Pu nodded as she crossed her arms.  “Mu Si is dead to me.”</p><p>
  The effects of her words on the winged girl were  dramatic.  She had paled as Shan Pu had  turned, but the confirmation sent her to her knees.  Ke Lun jumped over the rope into the ring and  stood before the trembling girl.  </p><p>
  “By Amazon Law, Mu Si, son of Brus,   Shan Pu, daughter of Par Fum, has declared  you dead to her.  From this day forward,  you will no longer exist to her.  Your  name shall not be spoken, your voice will not be heard, you presence will not  be acknowledged.  You are a ghost.”</p><p>
  Mu Si shuddered.   “I am a ghost.”  The winged girl  whispered.  Then she stood and with a  sob, threw herself into the air.  Shan Pu  didn’t even turn to watch as the winged girl vanished into the distance.  </p><p>
  Finally, she turned to Ke Lun, who was sadly looking  after the vanished Mu Si.  “Great  Grandmother?  Give Shan Pu water,  please.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun raised her eyebrow, but produced the cask.  Shan Pu took it and walked towards Ranma.</p><p>
  To her credit, Ranma tried very hard not to shy  away.  Shan Pu sighed and placed the cask  in front of Ranma.  “Ai Ren Akane like  Shan Pu be cat.  But Ai Ren Ranma is  important too.  If Ai Ren Ranma ask, Shan  Pu be cat <em>girl,</em> instead of cat.  If help Ranma not be afraid of Shan Pu, she  make change.”</p><p>
  Ranma blinked.   “Ummm.”  She stepped back.  “I?”</p><p>
  Ukyo placed her hand on Ranma’s shoulder.  “Hey, Ran-chan.  Don’t freak.   Think about what we talked about.”</p><p>
  Ranma’s hands clinched.  Honor and promises.  She turned to punch one of the ring’s posts,  the hollow metal rupturing.  She looked  down at the wreckage and her hands as the crowd took up a slow chant of “cat  girl, cat girl!”  </p><p>
  “<em>SHUT UP!</em>”  She screamed.   Dead silence fell across the field.   Ranma whirled.  “Is that what you  want?”</p><p>
  Shan Pu stood silently.</p><p>
  Ranma looked down at her hands.  “I know you aren’t able to help being a  cat.  I know you’re not responsible for  my dad throwing me in a pit.  I-  I-.”  She stopped and took a deep  breath.  “I can’t… I <em>won’t</em> ask you to curse yourself further, Shan Pu.  Akane had no choice, we had to have  warriors…  I can’t force you to change  yourself because of my stupid irrational fears.   I- I don’t know if I will find it easier to deal with if you’re a cat  girl.  I don’t know if I should ask you  to be one.”  Ranma forced herself to look  Shan Pu in the eyes.  “I have promised to  take you as my wife Shan Pu, every bit as much as I have promised to take Akane.”  Blood dripped from Ranma’s clenched  hands.  “<em>I will get over this.</em>  Just…  just give me time.  I can’t make a  decision like this without thinking about it.”</p><p>
  Shan Pu gave Ranma a quiet smile.  “Shan Pu give Ai Ren as much time as  need.  Now not fear for Ranma  heart.”  She picked up the cask.  “Shan Pu keep till Ai Ren decide.”</p><p>
  Since Shan Pu couldn’t, Akane jumped into the ring and  gave Ranma a hug to the cheers and whistles of the crowd.  She even kissed the red head, causing the  crowd to cheer even louder.  Ai, still  strutting around shamelessly, started a cheer calling for a strip show.  Akane just gave her a dirty look.</p><p>
  Finally, Ke Lun waved the crowd to silence.  “I declare this match over!  Winner by forfeit, Ranma Saotome!”</p><p>
  Akane held up Ranma’s hand as the crowd cheered, but  Ranma pulled it down again.  “I could  have beat him properly if everybody hadn’t kept interfering.”  she said morosely.  “I mean, I didn’t beat him; Shan Pu just  drove him off with that little show of hers.”   She waved to the shreds and tatters of her clothes around the ring.  “And all I have to show for it is a strip  tease in front of the entire school.  I’m  gonna be hearing about the way you trimmed me forever!”</p><p>
  Akane swatted the red head on the rump. “Stop grousing  or I’m gonna give Ai back her sweater and make you walk home showing it  off.   <em>I</em> like it.”</p><p>
  Ranma gave her an evil eye.  “You know, ever since you decided you  actually liked sex, you’ve been rather bossy.”</p><p>
  Akane smiled “Yep.   And if I actually told you to take off that sweater right here, you’d do  it too, wouldn’t you?”</p><p>
  Ranma blushed.   “Point taken.”</p><p>
  Akane gave the red head a smile.  “You and Shan Pu both.  You’re these amazing powerful warriors, but  you like it when I boss you around about certain things.  Things that let you know how attracted I am  to you.”</p><p>
  Ranma shrugged… but blushed as well.</p><p>
  Ke Lun meanwhile had enlisted Shan Pu’s aid to clear a  path out of the field, and waved for Ranma and Akane to go.   They hurried up the momentary path and  ducked into the gym, where Akane got Ranma her spare gym clothes.  Ai showed up at the door as she finished  dressing, still nude, but holding her skirt.</p><p>
  “You done with my sweater, femboy?”</p><p>
  Ranma gave her a dirty look.  “Yeah, and don’t call me femboy.”</p><p>
  “You’re lucky I’m in a good mood, Ranma.  Your buddy stealing my clothes was a big  hit.  Wish I had thought of it myself  sooner.  The Hentai squad is worshipping  at my feet like it should again.”</p><p>
  Ranma sighed and tossed the sweater at the shameless  girl.  Ai caught it with a laugh as she  turned and exited out into the gym.</p><p>
  Akane shrugged.   “At least it means she’s likely to leave Zhu Shu alone for a while.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun appeared at the door, dressed once more in her  usual robe.  “Well, son-in-law, I’m glad  you have reconsidered your rash words this morning.”</p><p>
  “So are you going to release me from what ever it was you  did?”</p><p>
  “No, not yet, Ranma.   I think a week or so of being stuck as a female will do you good.  Perhaps it will help you concentrate on what  you will ask Shan Pu to do.”  She  smiled.  “I am glad you did not rush into  a decision rashly.  That is rare for  you.”</p><p>
  Ranma grimaced.   “Thanks.”  She shook her  head.  “What was up with Mu Si, anyway?”</p><p>
  Ke Lun’s eyes hardened.  “Mu Si need no longer concern you,  Ranma.  By Amazon custom, he is dead to  Shan Pu, and by extension, her family.  I  ask that you honor this, and if your paths cross again, ignore him.  If he will not allow you to ignore him, you  are free to do as you wish to convince him of the error of his ways.”</p><p>
  Ranma blinked, then shrugged.  “Okay.   I owe the jerk for the strip show anyway.”</p><p>
  Ke Lun’s eyes sparkled.  “Yes, I heard quite a few comments on how  cute the heart was.  Anyway, Shan Pu is  waiting outside for you.”</p><p>
  Ranma nodded and took a deep breath, looking at the  small cuts on her palms from clenching her fists.  “I will beat my fear.  I will beat my fear.”</p><p>
  Akane followed her out, her eyes drawn for a moment to  two women setting at the top of the bleachers, both strikingly beautiful.  One had long platinum blonde hair so pale it  almost glowed, the other had long hair that was pure white.  She blinked, but their strangely hazy look  didn’t fade.</p><p>
  “Akane?”  Ranma  called back to her.  “You coming?”</p><p>
  Akane looked back at the bleachers for a second, then  shrugged and joined her fiancée as they left field.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Mara watched the last of the stragglers leaving the  field, then leaned back to look over at Urd.    “That was a bit harsh, wasn’t it?”</p><p>
  Urd was looking at her notes.  “Yes, but unfortunately, necessary.  Mu Si was a tad… excessive, in his  infatuation.  Yggdrasil predicted that  anything less permanent would not get him to stop, and Shan Pu will <em>never</em> accept him.  I had to arrange for him to go to Jusenkyo  several weeks ago, though I’d only planned for him to get the water for Shan  Pu.  The klutz fell into the pools on his  own.”</p><p>
  “Interesting results.”</p><p>
  “Yes.  Not  really sure how it’s going to affect things.   Originally, Yggdrasil projected that Mu Si would follow Shan Pu to  Japan, eventually go to Jusenkyo, get turned into a duck, and then try to turn  Akane into a duck, finally becoming a thorn in Ranma’s side as he continued to  try and win Shan Pu.”</p><p>
  Mara raised an eyebrow.  “I thought no-one could know the future?”</p><p>
  Urd smiled.   “Yggdrasil gave it a seventy five percent likelihood.  That’s about as high as it gets.  And Yggdrasil is the master control program  for this reality, so it’s the best predictor based on current program  data.  It’s not much use right now,  because for some reason, the moment I started trying to grant this wish, it’s  only giving me insufficient data to most of my prediction requests.  The best I’ve sweet talked it into is a  fifteen percent probability prediction.”</p><p>
  “Humm.  I can  see where that would make it difficult.”</p><p>
  Urd shrugged.   “Where goddesses are concerned, Yggdrasil usually will give a lower  predictability rating, but fifteen percent is exceedingly low.  It’s just one more thing making me wonder  whether we’re dealing with a reality nexus.”</p><p>
  Mara nodded off after the receding winged figure,  still barely visible to her preternatural senses.  “So what about his role in Shan Pu’s wish?  <em>His</em> happy ending?”</p><p>
  “I do have someone in mind for our young man… Sort of  killing two birds with one stone.  If I  judge his trajectory correctly, and if the spell of drawing I cast works…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p><em>I am dead.</em></p><p>
  <em>I am a ghost.</em></p><p>
  <em>I can not be seen, I cannot be heard, I  cannot be felt!</em></p><p>
  <em>I am dead.</em></p><p>
  <em>CURSE YOU, RANMA!!</em></p><p>
  Mu Si couldn’t stay in the air any more; the weight of  despair was too great. Better to end it all than be dead while still alive!</p><p>
  Eyes blinded by tears, heart leaden with sorrow, she  folded up her wings and allowed herself to plummet.  The cold embrace of the earth was all she  could expect, now that Shan Pu was forever beyond her reach.</p><p>
  The impact was enormous and she heard the sound of  breaking.  Pain beyond any she had ever  felt shot through her body as her ears filled with the sound of shattering  glass.  She felt herself plummet further,  landing on a surface that drove ten thousand pricks of pain through her as  glass rained on top of her, piercing her wings.</p><p>
  <em>I am a crucified angel.</em> she thought through the pain, laughingly recalling  the stories the occasional western missionary had tried to teach her as a  child.  <em>A messenger of love brought low by grief.</em></p><p>
  Then something struck her in the temple and all  thought faded.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Kodachi entered her room and tossed the bookbag  on the bed, falling into her favorite chair right after. It had been a long  school day, and she had arrived too late to even see her goddess that  morning.  Then the teacher had made her  stay in the room at lunch copying the notes she’d missed, and by the end of the  day, she had been too annoyed to even contemplate checking out the rumors of a  duel taking place after school, wanting to only get home to her private gym and  practice. She chuckled as she reached into her pocket and withdrew a hexagonal  medallion, it’s face carved in the symbol of a rabbit.  It would be all too easy to go and crush that  new meddler in her goddesses affections, but no, it would be far better to  destroy her publicly, to show her Mistress who truly deserved her love.  So she had failed to destroy Zhu Shu in Hong Kong,  it mattered not, the Chinese Oni was obviously little more than a nuisance  anyway.  She may have escaped the trap  she and Valmont had created, but it was obvious that Valmont’s employer, Xi’an  Chi would deal with the harlot eventually.   What truly mattered was discovering Zhu Shu’s affections for that black  haired miko, Rei Hino.  She could safely  strike the Chinese girl from the list of rivals for her Goddess.</p><p>
  Indeed, it was more aggravating to realize  she had been duped by her brother, that <em>he</em> had accompanied Akane to China  when she had vainly gone to Hong Kong.  That her brother had failed to stop Akane’s  betrothal was unforgivable, though inevitable.   Sasuke had told her that the fool had not left the family shrine since  he had returned.  </p><p>
  She laughed as she stripped and stood  before her mirror, recalling the marks she had borne following the match in  which her Goddess had captured her heart.   Sasuke’s report had revealed how much Akane valued a true warrior.  It was small wonder she had not yet been  graced by her Goddesses favors.  She had  yet to prove herself.  Her fingers traced  the rabbit carved on the medallion as she hung it around her neck from a fine  gold chain.</p><p>
  <em>Yes, I will prove myself for  you, Mistress.  I will crush the purple  haired harlot and show you my worth! </em> </p><p>
  She looked up from pulling on her leotard  at sound of something crashing into the greenhouse.  She growled as she tugged the sleeve into  place and headed for the garden.  It had  better not have been her idiot thrice bedamned brother throwing Sasuke out a  window again!</p><p>
  She emerged from the mansion to look at  her private retreat, frowning at the enormous hole.  Swearing she was going to feed Tatewaki to  Mr. Turtle, she stormed towards the door.</p><p>
  The interior was even more annoying.  Whatever had crashed through the roof had  been directly over her prize black roses.   She rushed in to check on her darlings, the rage building to murderous  intensities as she determined both Tatewaki and Sasuke were going to die for  this…</p><p>
  Then she saw what had crashed through the  roof, and her breath caught, all anger forgotten in her wonder.</p><p>
  The angel was unconscious, blood trickling  from a gash on her forehead where a support frame had landed, and from several  glass shards that had pierced her snow white wings, but miraculously, none of  the long slivers of solar glass had impaled the slender, graceful body.  Kodachi couldn’t pull her eyes away from the  vision.  The long black hair matched to  pale skin, the wings so white they almost seemed to glow, the ethereal beauty…</p><p>
  She knelt, her hand touching the angels  throat as she felt for a pulse.  The  winged girl groaned and mumbled.  Kodachi  leaned forwards to catch the faint sound.</p><p>
  “Curse… Ranma… Shan… must… die…”</p><p>
  Leaning back, she felt her heart  hammering.  Then she laughed.  The gods had sent her a messenger!  A harbinger of doom for her rivals!  Surely it could be nothing else!   The sign which she had prayed for so long  had come!</p><p>
  Laughing madly, she reached for the bell  to summon Sasuke. </p>
