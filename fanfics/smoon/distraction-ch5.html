<p>Usagi was humming cheerfully while mixing the pancake batter,  putting in chocolate chips on occasion whenever she felt like it.  Makoto had begun to prepare the cooking utensils, laying them out on  the counter. Ami made her way to the pantry and spotted Minako walking  down the hallway.</p>
<p>“Ohayou!” exclaimed the pop idol as she entered the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Rei still asleep?” asked Makoto.</p>
<p>“Like a rock,” replied Minako.</p>
<p>“Strange,” said Usagi as she stuffed a chocolate chip into her mouth.</p>
<p>“Hm? What’s strange Usagi-chan?” asked Ami.</p>
<p>“Well, Rei is usually the first one to wake up. Doesn’t she have her shrine duties in the morning?”</p>
<p>“  I figured they probably gave her a break, seeing that she only arrived  last night,” replied Makoto, who was turning on the stove, “By the way  Usagi, if you’re done stashing enough chocolate in that batter can I  have it please?”</p>
<p>Usagi blatantly stuck her tough out to Makoto  and passed the bowl to her, while pouring the remains of the chocolate  chips on a separate bowl. Minako giggled a bit as she settled in a seat  next to Usagi and took a piece of chocolate.</p>
<p>“You two shouldn’t even be having too much sugar in the morning,” said Ami as she placed a pitcher of orange juice on the table.</p>
<p>“And  Kami-sama forbid that Usagi get hyper from all that sugar. That’s worse  than having alcohol in her system,” finished Makoto.</p>
<p>“Why’s that?”</p>
<p>“Because she actually <em>knows</em> what she’s doing,” answered Ami.</p>
<p>“I am not that bad!” exclaimed Usagi, still digging into the bowl of chocolate.</p>
<p>“Anyway,  going back to the topic,” interrupted Minako, “There are younger miko  working at the shrine now, and who are under Rei’s position. So maybe  they are the ones in charge of the past duties Rei used to have in high  school?”</p>
<p>“It’s been a while since we’ve stepped foot at the Hikawa Shrine, I haven’t been able to see the new miko.”</p>
<p>“They are so small and to think we were once that age.”</p>
<p>“Minako-chan, you make us sound so old!” exclaimed Usagi with a pout on her face.</p>
<p>“We were <em>fourteen</em> when we became senshi.”</p>
<p>“Has it really been six years already?” sighed Makoto.</p>
<p>“Not much has changed, ne?” said Ami as she sat nearby Minako, leaning her head on her hand.</p>
<p>“Do you miss it?” asked Minako as she began to draw on the counter with her fingers.</p>
<p>“Miss what?”</p>
<p>“Our senshi days…Do you miss it?”</p>
<p>----<br />
  <em>She stood outside soaked in the rain. </em>Why am I even here? This must be the silliest thing I have ever done in my life, but I can’t keep her out of my head. <em>Rei  felt her skin prick to the sensations of the cold raindrops. Her body  began to feel numb from standing outside for too long, but she refused  to leave. Minako was inside that building, and the security guards  refused to let the miko pass through. So, she had no other choice but  to wait. Finally, she heard a roar from the crowd and knew exactly who  was coming out. The paparazzi crowded nearby a limo, and Rei could see  a distinct figure trying to pass through them.</em></p>
<p><br />
  “Minako!”  yelled the miko. Rei quickly opened her eyes, a bit disoriented from  the unfamiliar surroundings around her. The sun blazed into her eyes  and Rei squinted from the glare.</p>
<p>She sighed, “Just a dream.”</p>
<p>The  miko looked around the room and from what it seemed like, Usagi left  her bed unmade. However, the futon Makoto and Ami shared was neatly  folded to one side of the room. She also saw that their belongings were  still where they placed them, meaning that none of them had left yet.  Rei sank back into the pillow and stared at the ceiling. Upon hearing  someone slide the door open, the miko sat up once again.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re awake,” said Makoto as she walked inside to grab something from her bag.</p>
<p>“What time is it?”</p>
<p>“Almost noon. I’m surprised you didn’t wake up as early as usual.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s nice to take a break since-” Rei suddenly shot up. “Did you just say it’s almost noon?!”</p>
<p>Makoto  looked at the miko, startled at the sudden change in her tone. Rei  rushed towards her belongings, hastily stuffing them into her small  bag. She slipped in between Makoto and the wall to grab her jacket, and  ran back to her bag.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” asked Makoto as she moved out of the way.</p>
<p>“I promised the younger miko that I would be helping them with meditation at one!”</p>
<p>Rei  ran out the room, still trying to put her other shoe on. The girls were  already in the living room, and noticed that the miko was awake.</p>
<p>“Rei-chan!” exclaimed Usagi.</p>
<p>“Gomen Usagi, but I have to go.”</p>
<p>“Do you have to leave so soon? This is the first time we are all together for the day!” whined Usagi with a pleading look.</p>
<p>“Um. Just call me then? Maybe we’ll do something later,” replied Rei as she opened the door and disappeared behind it.</p>
<p>After  a jogging few blocks, she turned around the corner and found herself  climbing the stairs to the shrine, skipping a few steps at a time. She  was glad to be in good shape because even those stairs were hard for  Makoto to run up. Hurrying into the temple, she quickly went into her  room and started to change into her miko outfit. After a sliding back  from the desk to the mirror, she slid the door open found one of the  younger miko walking in the hallway.</p>
<p>“Erika,” said Rei when she recognized the girl, “What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“Rei-chan! I mean…sensei…I mean…g-gomen,” she bowed so quickly that it surprised Rei.</p>
<p>“Erika, you don’t have to call me sensei.”</p>
<p>“It’s different now that I’m training as a miko here,” she replied.</p>
<p>Rei  looked at the girl. Was it only yesterday when they were both painting  pictures of Princess Kaguya together with Usagi? After six years since  that time, Rei’s appearance stayed the same, with an exception of a  matured face and longer hair. Erika, however, had grown to be about the  same height as Rei and still sported the braided pigtails.</p>
<p>“You  can still call me Rei-chan. Sensei makes me feel rather old,” replied  Rei, “which I am not!” She added the last reply because Erika had begun  to giggle a bit. They made their way into the meditation room, where  the rest of the younger miko waited and shifted nervously. Word about  Rei’s short temper had circled around the shrine and they did not want  to get on her bad side. Gracefully sitting before the young crowd, Rei  looked at every one of them, some being the children she used to watch  over the years. After their session was over and each young miko  scurried off to do their assigned chores.</p>
<p>Rei was the last to  walk out the room, and looked outside at the entrance of the temple.  She made her way towards the garden and settled in secluded bench just  a few feet from the other entrance to her room.</p>
<p>Meanwhile at  Usagi’s home, everyone was still inside the living room. Usagi had the  television on and Makoto was lying on the couch reading a magazine.  Minako, seated cross-legged on the floor, was playing chess with Ami.  The pop idol looked up at Makoto, whose face was hidden behind the  pages and winced when she realized that the front cover was a picture  of herself.</p>
<p>“Makoto. It’s kinda weird seeing myself like that,” she finally said as Ami softly claimed to have the idol cornered in chess.</p>
<p>Makoto  peeked from the magazine and looked at the idol, “Hm? Oh…come on  Minako. You should even be used to seeing your face on billboards by  now.”</p>
<p>“Not really,” replied the idol as she tried to  strategically move the bishop piece on the chessboard, “Oh I give up! I  will never win against Ami in these things.”</p>
<p>“I’m surprised Usagi even had this in her house.”</p>
<p>They were now putting the board game away and then pushed Makoto’s feet off the couch to have room to sit.</p>
<p>“Hey! I play chess once in a while with Mamoru.”</p>
<p>“And do you even know how to play?”</p>
<p>“Of course! You just jump whatever is diagonal from you!”</p>
<p>Makoto sighed and placed down the magazine again, “Usagi…those rules only apply to checkers.”</p>
<p>Ami laughed a bit, “So what are we doing later on?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, shouldn’t we call Rei? I’m pretty sure she’s finished with meditation by now,” said Minako.</p>
<p>“Why don’t <em>you </em>call her,” suggested Makoto with a sly smirk plastered on her face.</p>
<p>Minako turned away from her friends in an attempt to hide her already red face. “She doesn’t have her cell phone, remember?”</p>
<p>“That’s right…she really needs to get back into the habit of carrying one.”</p>
<p>“Try the temple.”</p>
<p>Minako  began to dial the numbers and heard it ringing on the other line. After  a few long rings, she hung up and turned towards everyone, “Nobody is  answering.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t we go there instead?” suggested Ami.</p>
<p>As  the girls arrived at the shrine, they started to walk around. Seeing  that nothing has changed, except a few new faces here and there, they  made their way towards where Rei’s room was located. However, when they  passed by the shop, Makoto grabbed both Ami and Usagi.</p>
<p>“Hey!” exclaimed Ami as Minako noticed and turned around.</p>
<p>“Hm? Where are you guys going? Rei’s room is this way,” she pointed.</p>
<p>“Ah,  I just realized that I wanted to check out the shop. There’s  some…uh…charms I would like to buy for good fortune. You know for the  flower shop and all.”</p>
<p>Usagi looked at her friend confused, “But Mako-chan, didn’t you already-”</p>
<p>Makoto placed her hand on the girl’s mouth to keep her quiet, “Minako, you go on ahead and get Rei. We’ll be at the shop.”</p>
<p>A bit confused, the idol shrugged it off, “Okay then…”</p>
<p>She  started to make her way into the building and disappeared from their  sight. When the three girls saw that the idol was beyond earshot,  Makoto let go of Usagi, who was desperately flinging her arms in the  air.</p>
<p>“Mako-chan! Are you trying to suffocate me?”</p>
<p>“Calm down, I wouldn’t have done that if you hadn’t opened your big mouth!”</p>
<p>“But, you <em>already</em> have those charms!”</p>
<p>“Usagi. Sometimes…nevermind…I give up trying to explain.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Ami put her hand on Usagi’s shoulder, “You still don’t get it do you?”</p>
<p>“Get what?”</p>
<p>Minako  stepped into the building recalling that she was there last night. She  looked around the area and down the hallway. Walking rather cautiously,  Minako approached the door to miko’s room that it was left slightly  open.</p>
<p>“Rei?” she said, hoping for a small response to come from  the other side. However, Minako was only welcomed with silence when she  peeked through the small opening. Slowly sliding the door open, she saw  that the room was empty. Minako looked around and then to the other  door that led to the garden outside.</p>
<p>Finally, she spotted a  familiar miko with a sour face sitting at a solitary bench. Minako made  her way outside and Rei had not taken any notice of her presence. She  smiled and then tapped the miko’s shoulder. Rei nearly jumped and  turned around, only to have her cheek poked by someone’s finger.  Slightly annoyed, she looked up and found a pair of familiar brown eyes  hidden beneath the shadows of a baseball cap.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” asked Rei.</p>
<p>“You really should start carrying your cell phone. We called the temple, but nobody answered.”</p>
<p>“We?”</p>
<p>“They’re at the shop. Makoto said she needed to buy some charms for the flower shop.”</p>
<p>Rei  looked at the idol in confusion because she knew for a fact that Makoto  had already bought the charms a few years ago. Finally realizing that  this was once again her attempt to set the two girls up, Rei closed her  eyes and pinched the bridge of her nose. She was going to have a talk  with Makoto. Noticing that the miko was slightly annoyed, Minako  shifted from where she stood and looked around the garden.</p>
<p>Rei finally spoke, “So, are you just going to stand there?”</p>
<p>She  realized that this was an invitation to sit beside the miko and Minako  smiled. However, Rei simply rolled her eyes and continued to observe a  few younger miko who quickly greeted her. They slowed their pace when  they noticed a girl sitting beside Rei, whose face was cleverly hidden  by the baseball cap. Rei looked at them with her eyebrows raised and  they walked hastily away.</p>
<p>“Any plans for tonight?” she asked as she impatiently tapped her foot.</p>
<p>“Nothing at the moment. That’s why we wanted to come here first.”</p>
<p>“My shrine is not a secret meeting base, you know.”</p>
<p>“Yeah but you are the hardest person to contact.”</p>
<p>Rei  looked beyond the horizon and could see from the Ferris wheel from the  amusement park, the very amusement park where she had to endure the  so-called group date with Takae-kun, Motoki’s fellow turtle enthusiast.  She winced, recalling how he hiccuped throughout the whole day, and was  later possessed by a youma. Minako had taken notice at what Rei was  preoccupied with, and coughed to clear her throat. The miko, looking  back at Minako, frowned.</p>
<p>“If you wanted to get my attention…all you had to do was ask,” she scolded.</p>
<p>The idol smiled a bit and replied, “How about we go there tonight?”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“There,”  Minako pointed towards the amusement park, “I’m sure it will be fun. I  haven't been there since I came back for Usagi's wedding.”</p>
<p>“Oh…yeah  sure.” Silence again. Rei hated these moments with Minako, she would  rather be arguing with the idol. Anything seemed better than to endure  the awkward silence between the both of them. It was true that their  last battle took place at that amusement park. Although Rei was unable  to participate in that battle, due to the injuries she sustained from  Mio at the time, she felt her comrades' beckoning for her power. She  recalled feeling a surge of warmth that as she reached out towards the  air. Rei shut her eyes tightly in an attempt to drift away from those  memories. Suddenly, her stomach growled ferociously and the miko bent  over to clutch it. Minako was laughing now and Rei could only stare at  her.</p>
<p>“Come to think of it…I haven’t had anything all day,” she finally said.</p>
<p>“Sounds  like it,” replied Minako as she dug inside her pockets. Reaching in for  two pieces of candy, she held them out and sighed. “This is all I have.”</p>
<p>“After all these years, you still just have candy?” said Rei as she accepted it.</p>
<hr />
“Oh  I like this one!” exclaimed Usagi as her eyes sparked with excitement.  She was hovering in front of a pink charm that read out<em> love</em>.  Usagi counted the amount of bills in her wallet and pulled out the  exact change. The young miko who took care of the shop was slightly  taken aback by the girl’s high enthusiasm. Ami on the other hand was  talking calmly with Makoto as they watched Usagi run from one end of  the shop to the other.
<p>“You do realize that you’ll really have to buy some charms, right?” asked the young doctor.</p>
<p>“A little browsing around won’t hurt.”</p>
<p>“We shouldn’t meddle with Rei or Minako. You know how delicate that subject can be.”</p>
<p>“It’s just a little fun.”</p>
<p>“I’m not worried about them as much. It’s <em>you</em> whom I’m concerned about, with the glares Rei keeps throwing, I’m surprised you’re still alive.”</p>
<p>“I need your help. I have a plan, but you can’t tell Rei- “</p>
<p>“Can’t  tell me what?” asked someone as Makoto and Ami turned around. Rei and  Minako were standing behind them, and all the blood seemed to have  drained from Ami’s face.</p>
<p>“How long have you two been standing there?” asked Makoto.</p>
<p>Rei  suspiciously eyed Makoto with her arms crossed, “Just enough to hear  the last word you spoke. You guys done here? They’re about to close  and- USAGI! Don’t touch those…they’re very fragile!”</p>
<p>The miko  rushed towards where Usagi froze in her footsteps. She sighed in relief  upon knowing that everything was still in tact, and gave the younger  miko some instructions. Pulling Usagi away from the priceless items,  they both rejoined the group. The sun was slowly setting beyond the  horizon, and lamps that surrounded the temple were already lit.</p>
<p>“Come  inside, I still need to change anyway,” said Rei impatiently as she led  the group into the building. They made their way past a few miko, and  one particularly greeted them. They all looked at her in surprise and  recognized the girl.</p>
<p>“Erika!” exclaimed Usagi, “You are training as a miko here now?”</p>
<p>Erika  was carrying a duffel bag that slung on her shoulders. She smiled at  them, as her friends stopped with her, “Hai.” Her friends looked at the  senshi with curiosity now, particularly the one who wore a baseball  cap. Minako turned away for a while, pretending that something caught  her attention. After a brief chat, both parties walked their separate  ways and Usagi was sulking about how much time has passed them. Rei  sighed once more as they made their way past a few tourists.</p>
<p>She  told them to wait inside her room, while she went to change. The four  girls began to observe the contents inside as they each settled at a  nearby spot. Minako smiled with glee when she picked it up a framed  photograph of Rei wearing the Nako Nako costume while Minako wore her  orange hat. It was taken when they were supposedly rehearsing lines  that day at the studio. Shaking her head from recalling the clueless,  and yet priceless, face Rei held, Minako could not suppress a giggle.  She carefully placed the photograph back into its hiding place.</p>
<p>Eyeing  Makoto pace back and forth made the idol a bit queasy. Perhaps her  stomach was still recovering from consuming alcohol the previous night,  because she stood up and excused herself. Making her way down the  hallway, the idol searched for the bathroom and opened one of the  nearby doors. There was a sudden yelp that emanated from the room and  Minako stood frozen in her spot.</p>
<p>Rei tried to cover her body with  her already stripped miko garments, and the idol turned around so  quickly that she bumped into Makoto who, along with the others, were  alarmed by the noise and rushed towards the commotion.</p>
<p>“What happened?” asked Makoto curiously, “I thought I heard…oh...”</p>
<p>Makoto looked from Minako to Rei and back to Minako.</p>
<p>&quot;What's  all the commotion? Is everything okay- ahhh!!!&quot; Usagi, who ran after  everyone, tripped and bumped into Ami, who pushed Minako and caused the  idol to lose her balance. She flung her arms forward as a means to  break her fall. However, Minako's hands landed on Rei's shoulders, who  was still trying to cover her body, and both girls landed on the floor.  Rei felt her head thud against the matted floor and knew that it was  going to leave a painful bruise in the end. She looked up at the idol,  who had her pinned down. Minako winced in pain and quickly rolled over.  Everyone was in the room now, trying to make sure that the two girls  were alright.</p>
<p>“OUT! OUT!” exclaimed Rei as she got up. She tried  to wave her arms, but realized that they were both preoccupied with  trying to cover her body. The door was still open, and she was cursing  rather loudly at all of them. As she slammed the door, they quickly ran  back to Rei’s room. Minako exhaled as she slid down to the floor and  buried her face under her cap.</p>
<p>Rei was trying to breathe as she  stood nearby the door and sank into the floor. Still tightly clutching  her miko garments, she continually replayed in her mind what just  happened a few moments ago. Why hadn’t she sensed that someone was  about to open the door? <em>Minako just saw…not to mention the other  senshi...wait how much did they see? But then again…it shouldn’t be a  big deal. It's not like I was </em>completely<em> naked, right? I mean...wait what am I thinking?! Focus Rei. </em>Shaking her head, the miko looked around the room and headed towards the closet. <em>Just in case, </em>she thought as she lightly closed the door. She was not planning on having someone walk in on her again.</p>
<p>In  Rei's room, Usagi was quickly apologizing to everyone for having to  knock them down. Makoto looked down at the idol, who's face was hidden  underneath her cap, and then smiled at Usagi.</p>
<p>&quot;It's okay. No harm  done, right?&quot; said Makoto as she tried to hide her smirk from  appearing. Ami looked at her friend worriedly, and shook her head.</p>
