<h1>Ice on Fire (part 4 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/icefire-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>One of the things Ami Mizuno had found herself
adapting to in loving Rei Hino was her attitude
towards certain holidays. Now as a shrine maiden Rei
observed the traditional Shinto festivals, of course
and like many Japanese also participated in Christmas,
but unlike most Rei took it a bit more seriously than
average. Ami supposed it was the Catholic girls school
that did it to her, but she didn&#39;t mind too much.

&quot;Merry Christmas,&quot; Minako Aino hugged Rei, then Ami,
the blonde&#39;s eyes twinkling with hidden mirth.

Her lover Setsuna Haruna hid a smile as the older
woman noted, &quot;You might want to open our present when
Rei&#39;s Grandfather isn&#39;t around.&quot;

&quot;That bad?&quot; Rei raised her eyebrows but Minako just
smirked.

&quot;Thank you for the meal,&quot; Usagi laughed, the blonde
hugging both impulsively.

Mamoru smiled, the black haired man shaking Rei&#39;s hand
as he said, &quot;It&#39;s been fun.&quot;

There was always a odd reserve between Rei and Mamoru,
though Ami wasn&#39;t sure they even noticed it anymore.
He was Rei&#39;s first real boyfriend, no matter how
things eventually turned out, and that history still
lay between them.

Rei smiled as she hugged Makoto and murmured, &quot;Thanks
for helping make the food, Mako. I don&#39;t know what we
would have done without you and Haruna.&quot;

&quot;Thank you for inviting us,&quot; Makoto smiled back, her
girlfriend by her side.

Ami tiredly leaned against the wall as they watched
the couples leave, each carrying their girts and
having left their own behind. &quot;I wish Haruka, Michiru,
Setsuna and Hotaru could have come over,&quot; she
admitted.

Rei stretched out tiredly as the black haired woman
noted, &quot;Well, now that Juri&#39;s moved in I bet they&#39;re
having a busy Christmas.&quot; She chuckled, &quot;Besides,
we&#39;ve all been invited over there tomorrow too.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Ami admitted as she paused in the doorway.
&quot;What do you think we got?&quot; she wondered, the blue
haired girl&#39;s eyes lingering on Rei as she neared.

Rei chuckled softly, smiling as she drew Ami close
into a lingering kiss.

&quot;What was that for...?&quot; Ami gasped, feeling her heart
racing a bit.

Rei winked as she pointed upwards, &quot;You were standing
under the mistletoe.&quot;

&quot;Rei!&quot; Ami blushed, moving away.

Rei laughed happily as they stacked up the gifts they
had received under the tree, planning to open them
tomorrow morning. &quot;Knowing Usagi she got me manga,&quot;
Rei admitted, &quot;I&#39;m not sure what she got you.&quot;

Ami smiled fondly as she thought of their leader and
future queen, a woman who could be so heroic at one
moment and totally scatterbrained the next. &quot;And I
probably got a medical text,&quot; she nodded.

Rei moved over to take her hands, &quot;We&#39;ll find out in
the morning when we see what else Santa brought.&quot;

Ami firmly made herself not say anything about the
non-existence of Santa. &quot;I guess so,&quot; Ami admitted as
she slid a arm around Rei&#39;s waist.

Rei gave Ami a curious look, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot;

With a little blush Ami murmured in Rei&#39;s ear, &quot;I have
a present here in my arms I&#39;d like to open early.&quot;

Rei turned a little in Ami&#39;s grip as she kissed her
once more, lingering tenderly. &quot;Oh I don&#39;t know,&quot; she
purred, &quot;have you been naughty or nice?&quot;

&quot;Naughty, I think.&quot; Ami grinned.

&quot;Then I think we&#39;ll have to have a long talk about
that,&quot; Rei chuckled as they headed through the living
room, down the hall and into her bedroom.

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

&quot;Good morning!&quot; the voice jerked both women from their
sound sleep as Grandpa called from the other side of
the paper door, &quot;It&#39;s Christmas morning!&quot;

Ami winced, the alcoholic beverages from last night
having left a tell tale gift of a pounding headache.
&quot;I think he&#39;s more enthusiastic about it than you
are,&quot; she muttered as they reluctantly pulled apart
and began to look for their clothes.

&quot;Well, Mother was fond of Christmas too,&quot; Rei admitted
a little sadly while she picked up her bra and pulled
it on hurriedly, unsure if her grandfather might come
in if he became impatient enough with them.

&quot;Ah,&quot; Ami nodded, mentally filing that fact away.

Both dressed and as tidied up as it was possible to be
Ami and Rei headed out, coming in to the living room
to see Grandfather eagerly dividing up the gifts for
them. &quot;He&#39;s like a little kid,&quot; Rei murmured to Ami
with fond amusement.

&quot;I am not,&quot; the older man laughed as he explained, &quot;I
just want to see all the goodies those girls left me.&quot;

&quot;Why am I not surprised...&quot; Ami smiled as they watched
him indulgently a moment.

&quot;Ah, Rei,&quot; Grandpa added a bit more seriously, &quot;it
came in the mail too.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Rei replied quietly.

&quot;It?&quot; Ami looked between them in confusion.

Rei&#39;s lips twisted bitterly. &quot;My Father&#39;s present,&quot;
she explained dryly, &quot;usually money since he can&#39;t
take the time to find out what I actually want.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Ami squeezed her hand gently.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Rei shrugged as she opened up the
courier envelope, &quot;I&#39;m used to it.&quot; Inside was the
expected money and a note from him, surprisingly
wishing both Rei and Ami a Merry Christmas.

&quot;He know about you two?&quot; Grandpa raised a eyebrow, &quot;I
figured he&#39;d object.&quot;

Rei shook her head, &quot;Father is the best at spin, he&#39;d
figure a way to play it to do the least damage to
himself. It&#39;s his way.&quot;

Ami decided Rei needed a distraction and picked up
Minako&#39;s gift. &quot;Let&#39;s see...&quot; she shook it gently and
was surprised as it buzzed loudly, shaking hard enough
that she dropped it. Still buzzing it vibrated across
the floor, then the festively wrapped box was still.

&quot;Minako?&quot; Rei tentatively touched the box.

&quot;Minako,&quot; Ami agreed. &quot;I can see why Setsuna told us
to open it when we&#39;re alone.&quot;

&quot;Is that what I think it is?&quot; Grandpa asked, blushing
faintly.

&quot;Knowing Mina, probably yes,&quot; Rei shook her head,
fighting back a grin.

End...

Notes: Just a short Christmas bit on the alternate
Sailor Moon cast. Ties loosely into Arisugawa&#39;s Locket
too, possibly after Juri gets serious with Setsuna.</pre>
