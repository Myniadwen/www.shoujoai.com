<p><strong><u>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</u></strong></p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s  POV</u></p>
<p><u></u><em>‘Are you all right?’</em></p>
<p>I opened  my eyes to see myself once again in my watery prison. Only this time,  it didn’t bother me; nothing mattered. Where I was, if I was dead  or alive, it simply had no place for concern in my heart; in the end,  even with my newly acquired power the Outers still blew a hole in my  energy barrier and Sailor Moon overpowered me.</p>
<p>All these failures…it makes me feel like no matter what I do, I  can’t get ahead. I can’t seem to stick to any of my goals. Being  a good heir, killing my parents, being a good friend to all those  people I met and protecting Hotaru…Everything ends in failure! I’m  so worthless that I’m even disgusted with my own existence. I’ve  always blamed others for how I’ve changed, that I’m the way I am  because of another person’s actions toward me. It was never my  fault. How could it be…?</p>
<p>But…it was my  fault.</p>
<p>Why do I let people affect who I am  anyway? No matter what I tell myself, I see nothing can change what  I’ve done.</p>
<p>Oh well…what’s the point in  worrying about it now? I mean there aren’t more battles to be  fought or enemies to run from. It’s just me here…K-Chan and me.</p>
<p>I let out a deep sigh and watched the air bubbles  float predictably upward.</p>
<p>…It’s so quiet  here.</p>
<p><em>Kaiya?</em></p>
<p><em>I think I’m all right for the  most part. </em>I finally replied.</p>
<p>I checked my arms  and legs. From Sailor Moon’s attack there were multiple burns and  cuts that hadn’t been there previously. That really was something.  Other minor injuries such as the bruises came from Uranus.</p>
<p>No wonder I was afraid of her; before Hotaru helped me out  it felt like the wind senshi could’ve easily ripped me apart if she  really wanted to. Evading or dodging would’ve been useless against  her, not with the kind of power she had now. In essence, Haruka back  there was the wind.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, and it’s been  bothering me since I came here… but I wonder why…</p>
<p><em>What  happened to the orange chain?</em></p>
<p><em>K-chan?</em></p>
<p> Why did she stop talking?</p>
<p>When I didn’t  get a response I searched the water above and below me from my  stationary post but I still could not spot it. It was gone as the  others had…all but these ones. The neon pink chain still lazily  watched overhead, continuing its role as the mere spectator. After  all this time, I wondered if it even had a purpose. It does nothing.  The other one though…My hand tugged at the thin aqua/gold chain  still embedded through my heart. Out of them all, this one hurt the  most. Every time I tugged on it, it would start to burn. And the  harder I pull at it, the more it would burn. Imagine what would  happen if I tried to rip it out with everything I had? The thought  sent shivers down my spine yet another portion of my mind still  remained curious. Damn thing.</p>
<p>Without thinking I  gave the chain another tug.</p>
<p><strong>FSSSH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>“Ow!”</em> Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!</p>
<p>No good…</p>
<p><strong>Ping!</strong></p>
<p>Hm?  I thought… I saw something.</p>
<p><strong>FLAAAAAAAAASH</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>As  if things couldn’t get worse, a time portal had opened in the water  in front of me where Sailor Pluto exited. I watched the keeper of  time, wondering how she could enter another’s soul so easily. It  must be really handy to have a job like hers at times like this, not  that I’d want it though. Can you imagine being stuck to guard a  boring place like the time gate? You probably couldn’t relax for a  minute with all the problems that could occur.</p>
<p><em> I wonder  how she did that…</em> Yet perhaps I should have been more worried  about what she was going to do now that she was here.</p>
<p>The  stoic woman stared at me, not looking too pleased at all. Besides  going against her wishes twice in a row, retaliating and then making  her chase after a time key, I suppose it would be a reasonable  assumption that she was mad at me for a reason. Or a few… If I  wasn’t so anxious I might’ve actually slapped myself in the head.  I was going to get it now and there wasn’t anything I could do  about it; even if I wanted to I can’t run away. I’m locked into  place.</p>
<p>A bright side to this, if I could count  it as one, Pluto couldn’t possible take me back home unless she got  rid of this chain. And that was something I doubted she could do.</p>
<p><em>“What do you want?”</em> I frowned, thinking my  thoughts to the woman. After all, speaking under water was useless.   I’ve had tons of experiences with that one.</p>
<p><em>“I knew  this wasn’t a good idea…”</em> The timekeeper sighed as she  thought back.</p>
<p>I blinked a few times, wondering if my eyes  were deceiving me; she looked way nicer all of the sudden. I thought  the first thing she would do was whack me with her garnet rod, not  talk. She’s nothing like I saw back in the Marine Cathedral (where  she brutally beat me down). Back then she was scary. She couldn’t  have a twin sister by any chance?</p>
<p><em>“Which idea?”</em></p>
<p><em>“I talked to your sister and she said the only way to  bring you back home was by force. Obviously even that did not  suffice.”</em> The tall woman pinched the bridge of her nose.</p>
<p>I  twitched. So that’s who the culprit was.</p>
<p><em>“Pluto? If you  haven’t noticed, I can’t go back home the way I am now. I hate to  admit it but I’m stuck. Stuck but good.”</em></p>
<p>I doubt even  K-chan could get me out of herewherever she was. It  could be possible that she must have used up all her power to bring  me here. Maybe that was why she wasn’t answering back now. Or…Come  to think of it, I’ve never seen her in her human form in here…could  it be that she can’t come here? Does that mean I’m stuck here  forever?</p>
<p>I crossed my arms as I contemplated the  thought.</p>
<p>When I ended up here I was awake…I didn’t get  knocked out or anything like the usual previous times… meaning  there’s no way I can wake up in the ‘real world’ like nothing  happened.<br />
  <em><br />
  </em>Pluto looked at me and gave a nod; I guess  she can see the chain after all<em>! “Whether you leave or stay is  up to you.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Up to me? I don’t understand. I’ve tried  to yank it out a few times but nothing.” </em></p>
<p><em>“The  original plan was to use Sailor Moon’s healing attack to return you  to who you were…only it failed because you weren’t evil. I see  now that your mind was not corrupted or controlled by this new power;  or else you would have attacked me as soon as I had arrived.”</em></p>
<p>They  thought I was crazy because I wanted to protect Hotaru? I wonder  where she as going with this…</p>
<p><em>“All people are capable  of holding negative energy…It is when a person goes over their  capacity limit than their minds become corrupt and easy puppets for  our enemy. In that sense, Sailor Moon thought that had been your fate  and attempted healing escalation.”</em></p>
<p><em>“…So much for  healing.” </em>I sarcastically thought. <em>“It felt like she was  trying to kill me; that light was giving me burns!”</em> I held out  one of my arms as proof.</p>
<p><em>“I assure you that was not our  intention. The problem was that your capacity to hold negative energy  was what saved you and what was about to be your downfall…” </em>Pluto  paused before continuing. <em>“Energy is energy, no matter how you  look at it. It merely exists in different forms. Because you held so  much already, Sailor Moon’s additional energy was pushing your body  past your limits. That…I believe was when your other power  intervened at the last minute to prevent your demise.”</em></p>
<p><em>“My  power?” </em>Oh…she must be talking about K-chan. <em>“So you’re  basically saying I got myself here and I have to find a way out?” </em>That wasn’t very helpful… <em>“….”</em></p>
<p>But if I could get out of here, what was the point in going back  now? I disobeyed my parents and fought against all the senshi, yet I  still don’t feel guilty about it either. It’s not like I’d say  ‘I’m sorry for not listening to you’ if I went back. I still  think I did the right thing in standing up for sis.</p>
<p>Pluto  seemed to misinterpret my sadness for another reason.<em><br />
  </em><br />
  <em>“Please do not be upset at what Haruka said to you in the  park.”</em></p>
<p><em>‘I LEFT BECAUSE OF YOU!</em></p>
<p><em>’</em>I still could  hear Uranus’s words.</p>
<p><em>“Oh…that.”</em></p>
<p>I looked down, wondering what I should say. I had almost  forgotten about that; it wasn’t something you’d want to remember.</p>
<p>When I heard it initially, I wondered…if  it really was my existence that made her leave Michiru. In a sense,  then that would mean I drove away both of my parents, leaving our  planets without their true rulers and sis with a bunch of business  work. Technically, that would mean I was trouble since the time of my  birth. Just another few things to add onto my list of bad luck  bringing.<br />
  <em><br />
    “Haruka did leave, but it was for other  reasons. Not what you think them to be.”</em></p>
<p><em>“What? That can’t  be possible. She said she left BECAUSE of me.”</em></p>
<p>The  jewel at the end of Pluto’s garnet rod began to glow.</p>
<p><em>“I  believe it is time to tell you everything. There will be no more  secrets. What you choose to do with this information will be through  your own choice and actions.”</em></p>
<p><strong>FLAAAAASH</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Planet  of Uranus, future vision</u></p>
<p><u></u>The area around me warped  into the scenery of my home. At first it showed the palace gardens,  the various atmospheric domes, the multiple corridors and then the  ballroom before it suddenly became dark.</p>
<p>A few  seconds later emerged a giant looking laboratory. I noticed that  there were many machines and scientists at work. The technology  entirely covered the walls, taking up almost all the space the room  had to offer. That left many of the workers perhaps a meter of  standing space between the rows of machines and lab tables.</p>
<p>I wondered what they were working so intently on.</p>
<p>One man to my left took a needle and inserted a yellowish  liquid into a solution filled test tube. Whatever he was trying to do  must have failed as no chemical reactions were produced. However he  didn’t seem disappointed and merely shrugged off the result before  placing a giant X on paper grid.</p>
<p><em>‘What is this place? Is  it really in the palace?’ </em>BecauseI’ve never seen it  before…</p>
<p><em>‘Do you know how it is possible for two women  to produce a child?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘…Technology wasn’t it?’</em></p>
<p><strong>Tup.  Tup. Tup. Tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>My attention turned to another man who  had just entered the room. He was carrying a big carton filled with  smaller cardboard boxes, nothing too interesting I figured. Only…it  seemed his peers disagreed. They immediately gathered around and each  took a box before returning to their workstations.</p>
<p>Curious, I followed one of the workers and watched him pull out two  glass containers, each holding what appeared to be a clear liquid.</p>
<p>That’s what they were excited about? Weirdoes…</p>
<p><em>‘Watch.’ </em> I heard Pluto thought.</p>
<p>With the aid of a microscope the  man began to pick at the fluid with tiny instruments. Was there  something in there?</p>
<p><em>‘You do know how small a human female  egg is correct?’</em></p>
<p><em>“Ah! So they’re doing genetic  engineering?’ </em>I knew that the process played a role in creating  kids for same sex couples but this was the first time I’ve ever  seen it. I had also heard that most of these kids were born in test  tubes. So where were they? <em>‘Is that what they did with  me?’</em></p>
<p>Pluto shook her head. <em>‘…You were a little  different.’</em> A small smile lit her face.</p>
<p>It was a  surprise to me. It’s like, WOAH! She actually  smiled.</p>
<p><em>“Really?”</em></p>
<p><strong>FLAAAAASH</strong></p>
<p>The  area warped again. This time the place was a tiny room. There was  hardly any light in here compared to the other well-lit  place…</p>
<p><strong>Crackle…crackle…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>A golden light  was sparking in one of the machines up ahead, being held within a  transparent glass. That was Uranus’s power wasn’t it? I looked to  Pluto for explanation.</p>
<p><em>“If the doctors had created you  like all of the others you would have been born a normal  child.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Normal? Like as in no powers?”</em></p>
<p><em>“The  human body is what it is. Humans reproduce to pass on their genetic  or physical traits. The senshi power however comes from the soul,  thus proving a complication for a second generation of senshi. In a  given sense, your parents fused a portion of their power in you and  with it, a piece of their souls. Due to the process, you not only  gained the planet’s power, but you also inherited the natural  athletic and artistic traits you now possess.”</em></p>
<p><em>“…But I’m  still me.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes, you are. Your own soul is different and  unique. All I am stating is that you also harbor pieces from your  parents.”</em></p>
<p>This was really giving me hard time to wrap my  head around. <em>“Okay, I follow. Is that why I was different from  those other kids? Because I have powers?”</em></p>
<p><strong>FLAAAAASH</strong></p>
<p>I  felt the room shift again. After a few seconds we were looking into a  hospital room. Michiru was there in the bed, sleeping. Although…she  looked extremely exhausted. Did something happen?</p>
<p><em>“She  gave birth to you.”</em></p>
<p>I could have fallen  down and died right there from shock. Well…that was something  wasn’t it?</p>
<p> My eyes widened as it had  taken my brain a few extra seconds to register what I had just heard.  If Michiru had actually given birth to me then that would mean I  wasn’t born in a test tube.</p>
<p><em>“She loved you before you  were born. So much that she insisted on giving you the most normal  life possible; and so she carried you for nine months before she gave  birth.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Knock knock.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I saw Haruka enter  the room and made a beeline to Michiru’s side. The tall blonde gave  the tired woman a peck on the cheek and leaned down to whisper,</p>
<p>“It’s a girl.”</p>
<p>I doubted it was a big  surprise though; it was genetic engineering after all. Still…I  suppose some parents like to be told the information over again, just  to make the situation seem more real instead of a dream. The two of  them probably had to wait a veeeeeery long time before they got this  chance.</p>
<p>A group of doctor’s came in, holding a bundle  swaddled in clothes. Many of the nurses cheered and clapped, knowing  the ‘husband’ had just given the good news. To my surprise they  looked genuinely happy.</p>
<p>“Congratulations!” The head  doctor congratulated as he handed the small baby to her  mother.</p>
<p>Through half lidded eyelids, Michiru gave the baby  girl a long look before releasing a peaceful sigh. “She’s  beautiful.”</p>
<p>“I wonder what her eye color is like.”  Haruka mused; as the baby’s eyes were clamped shut. It would be  some time before they opened.</p>
<p>“Well, according to genetics  they’d be either green or aqua blue.”</p>
<p>I did a double take  as Pluto (?) and the rest of the senshi gang entered the room.</p>
<p>“We  brought gifts and flowers.” Makoto informed the new parents.  Everyone looked so grown up.</p>
<p>“Can I see her?” Chibi-Usa  pushed her way through the crowd. Especially Chibi-Usa. I noticed  that she wasn’t so small anymore. Compared to her past self, I’d  say she hit quite a growth spurt. I was still taller though.</p>
<p>“You’re  all here…” Haruka seemed to look surprised. “Are you sure it’s  all right to be gone from your planets? What if your people  worry?”</p>
<p>The group of rulers looked at one another. Even the  Queen of Crystal Tokyo was there among them. “We told them we were  at a meeting!” They all grinned.</p>
<p><em>‘Ah…tricky.’ </em>I  couldn’t help but grin as well.</p>
<p><em>‘Yes. As you can see,  people really don’t change. Even after a few centuries.” </em>Pluto  commented.</p>
<p>“So what’s her name?” Minako shouted out. The  others looked on expectantly.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you haven’t  given her a name yet!” Rei scolded.</p>
<p>“Erm…We haven’t  had the time to think of a name before now. She was just born you  know.” Haruka squirmed on the spot before turning her attention to  her ‘wife’. “What do you think Michi? Do you have a name in  mind?”</p>
<p>“…What do you think about ‘Kaiya?’</p>
<p>“It  sounds good. What does it mean?” Her blonde partner  asked.</p>
<p>“Forgiveness.”</p>
<p>There were awes that went  around the room.</p>
<p>“Then Kaiya it is.”</p>
<p><strong>FLAAAAASH</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>We  saw Haruka outside of the hospital room, looking very agitated about  something. Everyone else was inside, still being cheerful and  congratulating the new mother over and over again.</p>
<p><em>“Is  this where…?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes…”</em></p>
<p>The head strong  ruler walked down a few corridors until she reached an empty one, far  away from her friends.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe it…I’m a ‘dad’  now.” A shocked expression was still plastered all over her face.  She looked happy and yet sad. “When I held her in my hands, I felt  like I could never be happier in my entire life. She was so small and  fragile…a cute little thing. Michi and I never imagined that this  could ever happen…and yet here she is!” Haruka’s eyes began to  tear slightly. “…I love them both so much…but I’m afraid. I  don’t want to become like <em>him</em>.” Her voice suddenly trailed  off.</p>
<p><em>“Who’s him?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Her father.”</em></p>
<p><em>“…Oh.” </em>I frowned. She still couldn’t forget about that rat bastard  this entire time?</p>
<p>“Can I guarantee that I’ll be a good  parent?” She looked at her hands. “I know…that I’m not good  at expressing my feelings, even now. And…I’ve failed many people  time and time again…” She hung her head. “…”</p>
<p><strong>TUP!  TUP! TUP!</strong></p>
<p><strong>FLAAAAASH</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I stared forward at the gates  of time. It was huge! It was an archway in the middle of time’s  main road.</p>
<p><em>“Haruka came to me shortly after your  birth.”</em></p>
<p>I saw the blonde ruler discussing with Pluto’s  past self. They seemed to be having a very serious discussion; I  could feel the intensity of it even though it was only a vision.</p>
<p>“Do  you understand what you are asking?” Pluto narrowed her eyes at her  long time friend. She looked very shocked at Haruka’s request,  whatever it was. However the tall blonde was refusing to back  down.</p>
<p>“Yes, I do. I don’t want to risk it happening. It’s  for the best.”</p>
<p>“If I send you back in time, your soul will  fuse with your past self. I won’t be able to pull you back. You’ll  have no choice but to live everything all over again!”</p>
<p>“I  know.”</p>
<p>“Haruka…”</p>
<p>“Setsuna, please!” She  then gave a deep bow.</p>
<p><em>“I don’t understand. What did  you mean by ‘there will be no coming back’?”</em></p>
<p><em>“…A  human’s soul is the same, no matter where in time. The complication  arrives when the same soul is in the same time frame; it would cause  a time disturbance. To correct this, if one travels back to a time  where they already exist then their soul will fuse with their past  self and erase the disturbance. Essentially it is why Chibi-Usa, you  and myself can appear in the previous time frame without  problems.”</em></p>
<p>Oh…I get it now.</p>
<p><em>“…So if  Haruka went back, then why couldn’t’ she remember her future  self? I mean, you said their souls fused.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Another  alteration. Memory seals are used to suppress her future memories. If  a person knew the future before it happened, they would be tempted to  change it. Usually seals require a week’s time before the future  memories have completely sealed away. The fact that Michiru had  followed Haruka to the past had influenced the seals greatly; once  their love was re-discovered, the seals had been considerably  weakened. That was to be expected as those two are meant for each  other. Then when you arrived, the seals began to slowly break down  even further. Haruka and Michiru’s memories started to leak  through. The critical blow however was when they discovered your true  existence, thus returning themselves to their future selves as you  know them now.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Hey don’t look at me, that was your  fault.”</em></p>
<p><strong>FLAAAAASH</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>We  were back underwater…</p>
<p><em>“The others are now formulating  our final offensive. We will infiltrate the Mugen Gakuen School, the  Death Buster’s main hideout.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Y-You aren’t going to  hurt Hotaru are you?”</em></p>
<p><br />
  <em>“Listen to me Kaiya,  when Michiru told you that she was not your sister, she meant it. It  did not mean that she loved Hotaru any less and that she truly wishes  to destroy her. What she told you was the truth. Hotaru had been  taken over by the Messiah of Silence. And while you were away, she  has taken Chibi-Usa’s heart crystal. Hotaru is no longer, you must  accept that.”</em></p>
<p><em>“You think killing her is really the only  way? Are you sure?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes, I believe it is the only way to  save this world and Hotaru’s soul. You may not believe it Kaiya,  but for a time I was also Hotaru’s guardian along with Haruka and  Michiru. Being a parent has not made this decision any easier.”</em></p>
<p>Pluto turned around and opened another time portal. <em>“Now, it is time for you to make your decision. It is my  sincerest wish that you will catch up to us.” </em>And she  left.</p>
<p><em>“…”</em></p>
<p>My head was still spinning from  all everything Pluto had shown me. All this time and everything I  thought weren’t true. Haruka didn’t leave because she hated me.  Both of them actually…</p>
<p><em>… know one thing</em></p>
<p><em>…………  one thing</em></p>
<p><em>………………… thing</em></p>
<p>My ears  perked up. It was that echo again, only it was different. It sounded  stronger than the previous times, almost as if they were here talking  to me.</p>
<p>Before my eyes appeared another image. The  figure in the vision was Michiru but she was crying. Could it be  after Haruka left?</p>
<p>“<em>I’m sorry”</em></p>
<p>She’s  sorry?</p>
<p><em> I am sorry cannot be here for you. Although it is a  pitiful reason, perhaps, it is something I must do. But do not  believe that it was an easy choice; it tears away at me that I will  not see you grow up into the amazing woman you surely will become. Be  strong…Grow strong into the kind of ruler our people desperately  need.</em></p>
<p><em>The journey will be difficult…and hard, but do not  give up. Do not quit! Do not run away! Whichever goal you set for  yourself, see it to the end.</em></p>
<p>But my goal was…If you  knew, what would you say? Would you still love me despite the hatred  I harbored for you?</p>
<p><em>Perhaps…we will see each other again  one day. It is my earnest wish that we may have such a chance.  Although by then you may feel nothing but hatred towards us, I want  you to know one thing…If only this much…I love you and always  will.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Silence</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong></strong></em>I love you…</p>
<p><em>“…”</em></p>
<p>What did I honestly think? What were my honest  thoughts about the situation?</p>
<p><em>I…really don’t  want to be here. I don’t want to be left behind. I don’t want to  sit back and watch. To be here for the rest of my life, never to say  what I really feel!</em></p>
<p><strong>Clink! Clink!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>“GET  THE HELL OUT OF ME!”</em></p>
<p>I yanked at the aqua/gold chain,  not caring about the intense burning sensation being  inflicted.</p>
<p><em>“GAAAAAAAAAH!” </em>It won’t budge!</p>
<p><em>‘Is  that your decision?’ </em>K-chan was back.</p>
<p><em>“I’m going!  Don’t even try to stop  me!”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Rumble…rumble…rumble…FWoOoOoOoOoOSH</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong></strong></em>The…pillar?  Why is my heart crystal here?</p>
<p>The stone began to pulse, as if  it had its own heartbeat. I remember this feeling; it was like  Michiru’s talisman at the Marine Cathedral!</p>
<p>Realization slowly dawned on me. It just occurred to me but  that’s what I need to get out of here. One of my arms stretched out  as if to grasp the large stone that lay just out of my reach. I could  feel the water around me getting warmer- this time, it was not  Hotaru’s energy I felt but something bigger and brighter.</p>
<p><em>“I  said…I’M  GOING!”</em></p>
<p><strong>ShhhhhhhhhhhhHHHHHHH-<br />
  SHINK!<br />
  SHINK!<br />
  SHINK!<br />
  SHINK!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>All  the chains were back! Yet to my surprise, instead of attacking me as  I anticipated they had wrapped around the large pillar. I could only  watch in awe at what was happening.</p>
<p><strong>Crack…CrAcK…CraCK…CRACK!  CRACKLE!</strong></p>
<p><strong>FWOOOOOOOOSH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The stone pieces had been  shattered, leaving behind a large spear in its place. To my surprise,  the pulsing did not stop but became stronger. It emitted Uranus and  Neptune’s aura, intermingling all around the weapon. My eyes then  trailed it top to bottom. There was a singular large blade on it’s  top, glowing a transparent blue. The rest of its body consisted of  intricate designs with aura and gold colors, except for the hilt. Its  end was covered with pure gold strips. At first glance it almost  appeared to be tape with it being so thin. Its weapon type reminded  me greatly of Saturn’s yet it didn’t have the same feel.</p>
<p>My  hand was still outstretched, waiting…</p>
<p><em>“You’re…a  part of me.”</em></p>
<p>The spear began to shake as if responding  to my thoughts.</p>
<p><em>“I need you. So let’s go!”</em></p>
<p><strong>WHOP!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I  caught it in my hand. Now for this chain…I eyed the aqua/gold  one.</p>
<p><em>“HAAAAAAAAAAAH!”</em></p>
<p><strong>SHHHHRU-CRACKLE!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The  links broke apart from each other and vanished. I almost couldn’t  believe it; I was free. And…I had this power. I never knew  something like this was inside of me and I would have never guessed.  The kind of person I was, it almost seemed impossible. I thought I  deserved that pillar of stone.</p>
<p>I held the weapon  carefully in my hands, staring at it in shock. My fingers trailed  over its markings, taking in the feel of it. It was warm, not cold.  Strong, powerful, anything you wanted one to be. But inside I knew it  wasn’t a mere weapon; it was my soul. It wasn’t ugly after all…  It was beautiful.</p>
<p>My eyes came up to glance at the other  chains that had broken the spear free. They dangled in the area in  front of me, glowing their respective colors. Red, orange, yellow and  green were all back yet they hadn’t disappeared again.</p>
<p>I  had always wondered where they disappeared to…</p>
<p><em>“…”</em></p>
<p>What  did they want now? It didn’t look like they were going anywhere…in  fact it felt like they were watching me.</p>
<p><em>‘It’s your  power.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘My power? You mean those things are also my  power?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘A planet’s power is what it is. That cannot  change; the World Shaking and the Deep Submerge are general powers.  Each planet’s guardian has the general power of that planet.  However as you’ve seen, your parents also contain the space sword  and the deep aqua mirror. Those are unique as they reflect the  bearer’s soul…yours, that it is different from both of theirs  should not come as a surprise. You’ve overcome these four through  your journey. Red (Courage), Yellow (Happiness), Green (friendship)  and Orange (Strength). As you’ve discovered each of these  qualities…’</em></p>
<p><em>‘That’s why they disappeared one by  one?’</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes. They will now abide by your command. It was  through this power that I was allowed to bring you here. Generally  the four chains have the ability to bring you from any place to here,  within yourself. Unlike the guardian of time, this will not allow you  to travel through time but merely place to place. Any place to here  and only here. Only once you’re here can you travel to another  place of your liking.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Then you are the ones who brought  me here?” </em>I addressed the chains. <em>“C-can you take me to  the Mugen Gakuen School?”</em></p>
<p>The four chains began to move  until they overlapped one another and created a square looking  portal. Through the space in the middle I could see the school’s  entrance lobby.</p>
<p><em>‘Do not doubt them. If that is where you  truly wish to go, step forward.’</em></p>
<p><strong>Tup. Tup. Tup. Tup…</strong></p>
<p><u>Michiru’s POV, Michiru’s home</u></p>
<p><u></u>“So  we’ll take the school in a few hours.” Ruka voiced to the group.  “Each scout will pair up with the exception of Setsuna, Michi and  myself. The plan is to infiltrate from all sides. Whoever gets in  MUST finish off the Messiah of Silence.”</p>
<p>I glanced over at  Setsuna from the corner of my eye, wondering where the woman had  disappeared to during our group re-formation. Since she has returned  she had little to say of her departure.</p>
<p>“But she’s still  Hotaru!” Sailor Moon protested.</p>
<p>“She is no longer.”  Pluto suddenly spoke up.</p>
<p>“The girl has been taken over. How  many times do we have to tell you?” Ruka reminded the younger girl.  “You must realize that thing inside of her is eating away her soul.  Her body will eventually undergo a genetic regression into a monster.  She’ll just die in agony if we allow things to stay as they  are.”</p>
<p>“S-Still…”</p>
<p>I placed a gentle hand on  Sailor Moon’s shoulder. “It is a hard truth to face but we are in  a position where we kill or we will be killed. Us outer senshi wish  that all of us may work together as a group.”</p>
<p>“Really?”  The other inners stared in confusion.</p>
<p>“Time has changed our  views.” I kindly pointed out. Ruka and I have been wrong to think  the inner senshi were useless. That was not true at all; each  individual can contribute something to the group if we worked  together. Working alone many times over has proven nothing but  stubborn pride on our part. “Will you join us?”</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s  POV, Mugen Gakuen, Front lobby</u></p>
<p><u></u><strong>Tup…tup…tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I  exited the portal right where I expected to be and walked forward  before stopping short of the main hallway. What’s with this  hallway? Why are there plants everywhere?</p>
<p>I  stopped short of the vegetation line, not too anxious to jump right  in; they didn’t feel like friendly plants. Vines and thorny bases  coated the walls and ceiling, barely hidden underneath the decorative  plants. If a person carelessly walked right in or accidentally  tripped, they would be done for.</p>
<p><strong>Ping!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“ you a student here? If not, I’m afraid you’ll have to  leave.”</p>
<p>I carefully regarded the green haired/eyed witch.  It wasn’t the same Death Buster I saw last time.</p>
<p>“What’s  with all of these plants?”</p>
<p>“…Getting right to the point  huh?” Her eyes trailed over to my spear. However, she didn’t look  perturbed at all. “A Sailor Senshi?”</p>
<p>“…Nope.”</p>
<p>The  witch frowned. “Oh! So you must be the one! The mistress has been  expecting you.” I watched her become suddenly cheerful and open.  “You must be the new girl.”</p>
<p>What was she talking  about?</p>
<p>“I guess I should thank you on behalf of our  association for saving the Messiah of Silence.”</p>
<p>“…These  plants?”</p>
<p>She sighed. “Okay, okay. Well, the doctor said  all witches had to position themselves in the school to guard against  the Sailor Senshi.” The witch huffed. “Viluy, Mimete, Cyprine and  Ptilol are up ahead. I hope we don’t have to fight a lot, my poor  plants…”</p>
<p><strong>Lubb Dubb</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Is that so?” I  stepped forward into the plant growth. “Then…I guess I’ll have  to greet them all.”</p>
<p>“H-Hey, what are you  doing?”</p>
<p><strong>FWOOOOOOOSH</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The purple aura spread  out from my feet, leaving wilted plants in its wake. Sometimes it  takes dark energy to defeat dark energy. It was a shame these plants  had to be used for evil purposes, they were rather nice to look at  aside from the thorny vines.</p>
<p>The witch began screaming and  whining about her plants, now looking horrified instead of being  relaxed with my presence.</p>
<p>“Your turn.” I stepped  forward.</p>
<p>“Wait, c-can’t we talk about this? Aren’t you  on our side?”</p>
<p>“HaaaaaAAAAAAH!”</p>
<p><strong>TUP!  TUP!</strong></p>
<p><strong>SLASH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“YaAaAAH!”</p>
<p>The entire scene  vanished with her demise, leaving the corridor empty. One down, a few  to go…How hard could it be? If these stupid Death Busters think I’m  on their side, this is going to be easier than I thought.<br />
  Being here reminded me of what Pluto had said. Who said I  was going to catch up? I’m the welcoming party!</p>
<p><em>‘See  you guys there...’</em></p>
<p><strong>Tup…Tup…Tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Uranus’s  POV, outside the school</u></p>
<p><u></u>“What’s the reading?” I  called out to Mercury in my communicator.</p>
<p>Her face came online  and she didn’t look too happy. She frowned at her blinking computer  screen. “This doesn’t look good. It is detecting life forms but  they are multiplying at abnormal rates!”</p>
<p>Abnormal rates?</p>
<p>I narrowed my eyes and squinted towards the building. That’s  funny, I don’t see anything.</p>
<p>“It is coming.” Neptune  warns me.</p>
<p>Up ahead a red substance begins to seep out of the  window, doors, and any other exit it could get out of!</p>
<p>Never  mind…I see it.</p>
<p>The red goo pooled on the ground where  individual youma slowly showed themselves. They hovered above but  never completely parting from the substance.</p>
<p>Ugly  suckers…</p>
<p>“We’re going above!” Neptune and Pluto nodded  their heads. “The rest of you scouts, think you can handle it from  here?”</p>
<p>I could hear them all agree.  “YEAH!”</p>
<p><u>Helicopter</u></p>
<p>In a matter of  moments Neptune, Pluto and myself had boarded a helicopter, hovering  directly over the building where the inner scouts had set up a force  field to counteract the enemy’s.</p>
<p>If my memory served me  correctly, our helicopter was attacked before we originally made it  to the ground. From the corner of my eyes I could see Neptune and  Pluto staring at me. Apparently they remembered as well. No  guarantees that it would happen again but why don’t we make a more  appropriate entrance? Man, my blood was already boiling from the  excitement.</p>
<p><strong>Crackle, crackle…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Here it  comes!”</p>
<p>I ran forward and jumped the piece of junk with  Neptune and Pluto following directly behind. Now we wait until we’re  close enough to impact.</p>
<p>“World…”</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s  POV, mid-air</u></p>
<p><u></u>To shelter us from the inevitable impact  we were to combine our powers and create an upward rush of air. It  would cushion our weights enough that when we will hit the ground, an  easy ground roll will be sufficient enough.</p>
<p>Living in the  past…</p>
<p>“World…”</p>
<p>“Deep…”</p>
<p>“Pluto…”</p>
<p>Brings  everything back. More than I could ever have dreamed or imagined.</p>
<p>“SHAKING!”</p>
<p>There are no business meetings. There  are no responsibilities of over ruling an entire planet.</p>
<p>“SUBMERGE!”</p>
<p>There are only  friends…who fight for an ‘unknown’ future.</p>
<p>“Deadly  SCREAM!”</p>
<p><strong>WHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR-  Crackle, KABLAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>As calculated the three of us  made it safely to the ground. From what I could detect, the  helicopter above met its end accordingly while our enemy waited  ahead.</p>
<p>Uranus immediately pulled out her space sword and I  called out my deep aqua mirror.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p><strong>Tup!  Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Dark corridor</u></p>
<p><u></u>Both  sides of the corridor there were shelves, each containing a line of  dolls. I was not disturbed in the least; they were merely toys that  obeyed a single master.</p>
<p>“Welcome!” Doctor Tomoe greeted  us. He laughed as though we were simpletons who knew nothing of him  or his plans.</p>
<p>How very wrong he was.</p>
<p>I  lifted my talisman. My mirror emitted a stream of blue light and hit  the disguised monster head on. It flinched back in surprise.</p>
<p>“Can  it, we don’t have time for you!” Uranus charged forwards with her  space sword. “HaaaaAAAAA!”</p>
<p><strong>SLASH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Kaiya’s  POV, heart of enemy territory</u></p>
<p><u></u>The last witches made  their final death cry and dropped to the cold floor. As like the  others, they began to fade from existence. Twins, what a nuisance.  You have to take them both out at once or they’ll just counter for  each other.</p>
<p>Good riddance.</p>
<p>I walked forward knowing  very well that my enemy was near. Her presence seeped through the  walls, acting as a spy for intruders such as myself. I smiled  slightly, knowing that she knew I was here. The one who still  possessed Hotaru’s body, the one who caused all this trouble for  everyone. Already my mind could see her features. Long raven colored  hair that slide down to the floor. Her dark eyes were glinting with  amusement as I closed the distance.</p>
<p>It was true.  Hotaru is being possessed.</p>
<p>“So you’ve come.” The final  witch greeted. “I have waited for you my servant.”</p>
<p>Her  sweet words couldn’t fool me. If anything, it made me angrier.  Trying to pretend to be Hotaru wasn’t going to cut it.</p>
<p>“Bring  me the Holy Grail that Sailor Moon possesses. I require it. I need  more power!”</p>
<p>“Get it yourself.”</p>
<p>“WHAT?”</p>
<p>Something still didn’t feel right. Hotaru is  possessed, that much I have confidence in. But I swear I could still  feel her feel in that body. Does that mean she’s not dead? No, it  doesn’t matter what I think, there’s no way I’ll be able to  take that monster down and spare Hotaru in the process.</p>
<p>It…makes me sad. Don’t think about it! Just attack! I  tried to command myself.</p>
<p>“Come on, I’ll take you!”</p>
<p>“Not  without us you won’t!”</p>
<p>I turned to see Uranus, Neptune  and Pluto enter the chamber at the opposite end of the room. I  blinked, taking the sight in. They really have changed, I wasn’t  wrong. Haruka and Michiru really were now my parents. For some  reason, they were what I imagined them to be before this whole mess  started. The day before I left my room on my own…</p>
<p>They were  intelligent, strong and noble. Loyalty resonated strongly in their  auras. Before I was not blind, I stood up for what I believed in and  I don’t regret it a least bit. It’s my battle too, with my own  choices!</p>
<p>But now…</p>
<p>“Fine, but don’t slow me  down!”</p>
<p>Uranus smirked. Even though she’s changed, the old  Haruka was still there. “I told you to stop trying to play  hero!”</p>
<p>“Not that I’d ever listen to you!”</p>
<p>Uranus  charged in. With my general planet power sealed, I could only wait  for the enemy counter-attack.</p>
<p>“World…SHAKING!”</p>
<p><strong>WhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRR-  BLAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“ARGH!” The witch snarled. Her force field came  up but the attack still went through, taking out her left arm. Blood  streamed down as she glared back as her attacker with disbelief that  Uranus was as strong as she was. “HANDLE THIS!”</p>
<p>Dark  energy engulfed the room. Her power began to eat away at the walls,  weakening the supports. Warily I watched the pillars begin to crack  and then shoot up until everything threatened to collapse.</p>
<p>“AHAHAHAHAHAHA!” Our enemy laughed hysterically.</p>
<p>‘<em>Run  to them!’</em></p>
<p>I ran to the outer senshi as the roof came  toppling down. In a split second my energy barrier was up, protecting  us all from the imminent danger.</p>
<p><strong>Bam! Rumble, rumble,  rumble…CRASH</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The building had toppled but we were still  alive.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Die! Die! Die! DIE!  AHAHAHAHA!”</p>
<p>Something’s… wrong with the sky. It looked  like it was warping.</p>
<p>“This is a national emergency  broadcast! An official state of emergency has been declared. The  Tokyo Bay area has been placed under martial law!”</p>
<p>“They’re  evacuating the area!” Uranus exclaimed.</p>
<p>Mistress 9  continued to laugh in a crazed voice. “Heh heh heh! The time has  come. Now that Master Pharaoh 90 is filled with energy, it is time  for him to merge with this planet! To undergo Vessel transformation!  Once this Vessel Transformation is complete, this planet joined with  our Master will become a second Tau system. This planet will become  out mother planet!”</p>
<p>“Burning MANDALA!”</p>
<p>“Sparkling  Wide PRESSURE!”</p>
<p>Mars and Jupiter’s attacks  buried themselves into Mistress 9’s back, burning and electrifying  her body. As she turned around to glare at the scouts who had joined  the battle, Venus and Mercury unleashed their own.</p>
<p>“Venus  love-me CHAIN!”</p>
<p>“Shine Aqua IILLUSION!”</p>
<p>“ENOUGH  OF THIS!” The crazed woman launched a negative energy blast at the  four scouts. Sailor Moon cried out to her friends as they screamed in  pain. As soon as she had taken the four protectors to their knees,  she aimed a large black sphere at Sailor Moon.</p>
<p>From the corner of my eye I saw Uranus start forward but she would  not make it in time.</p>
<p>“NO! SAILOR MOON!” Everyone  yelled.</p>
<p>Come on please work! It would be a first  time attempt but I had to try! I raised my weapon, mentally calling  up my own power. The tip began to emit a strong blue  light.<br />
  <strong><br />
    ShhhhhhhhHHHHHHHH-</strong><br />
  <strong>SHINK!<br />
    SHINK!<br />
    SHINK!<br />
    SHINK!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The four chains shot out from the air, solidifying  immediately as the blast closed distance. Instantly they formed  another square like portal and sucked the energy in.</p>
<p><strong>LUBB  DUBB!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Argh!” I let out a painful gasp and coughed. It  felt like I couldn’t catch any breath! A burning sensation caught  me off guard, catching me in my chest before spreading like wildfire.  I kept coughing as my eyes began to tear. Soon something thick shot  up my throat. I could feel the force tear the sensitive tissue until  I finally coughed out blood. That’s what Pluto must have been  talking about…taking in too much energy and right to the soul too!  I really felt that one; my legs hurt so much…it’s so hard to  stand…</p>
<p>“You would dare to get in my way?” I saw the dark  eyes trained on me now. “It’s not too late servant, I’m still  willing to take you back. Join us. I can make all that pain go away.”  Her voice became sweet again as if she were a parent trying to coax  their run-away child to come back home.</p>
<p>“KAIYA! Don’t  listen to her!” Uranus called out.</p>
<p>Neptune  began to run towards me but one of the chains cut her off. She tried  to run around, a look of desperation in her eyes but they would not  let her pass. In a quick series of movements I watched her try to  force her way in. There was the initial roll inside past the red  chain. Courage…Her hand hit the ground and pushed herself to the  side as the Green chain whipped at her. Friendship…That was two. My  eyes followed her as she dove past the Yellow chain. Happiness…There  was one left. Everyone was watching as she readied for the charge  against the Orange chain.</p>
<p>“Haaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>The Orange chain dove in and she evaded and rolled. When she thought  she had passed the chain whipped around and captured her.</p>
<p>I’m sorry Michiru, but you don’t have the necessary  strength. Not alone. Our eyes met, hers wide with disbelief. If this  were any other situation before today, I would have ended it all  here.</p>
<p>I nudged my spear in the direction back to  Uranus, telling the chain to release Michiru gently.</p>
<p>“Kaiya,  Uranus and I-” The senshi of the ocean began.</p>
<p><em>… know  one thing</em></p>
<p><em>………… one thing</em></p>
<p><em>…………………  thing</em></p>
<p>“I know. But… don’t you guys have a job to  do?”</p>
<p>“What do you…?”</p>
<p>“Neptune, hurry!”  Pluto called to the third outer. I saw Michiru give me a fleeting  glance before she ran to her comrades. Obviously they had something  to do, something only they could do.</p>
<p>The sky above  began to emit a wave of vibrations that began to split the ground.  Something was coming.</p>
<p><strong>Rumble, rumble, rumble…CRASH!  Rumble…</strong></p>
<p>Now the four chains hovered  around the witch and myself, without any real shape, just hovering in  the air.</p>
<p>“I call upon my minions, come serve your mistress!”  Mistress 9 called out. A sludge of red goop began to form outside my  chains, quickly multiplying. The other inners began to fight back  against the substance, desperately trying to dispose of it before the  monsters would begin to multiple and out number us all.</p>
<p>Hotaru  chan…</p>
<p>Uranus, Neptune and Pluto leapt up atop three  separate buildings above, surrounding the one that had been  demolished minutes earlier.</p>
<p>“We must protect this land where  our future ruler Neo queen Serenity was born!”</p>
<p>Pluto…</p>
<p>“We  must protect this land which will become the new Silver  Millennium!”</p>
<p>Neptune…</p>
<p>“That is our  duty!”</p>
<p>Uranus…</p>
<p>The three outer senshi held up  their talismans, each glowing a bright light. In a flash, the three  created a bright barrier around the area, sealing it off. The mass of  red slime burned up in the seal area, making it impossible for the  witch to use her minions any longer.</p>
<p>“You’ve put up a  shield? It’s useless!” Mistress 9 raged.</p>
<p>I’m  sorry…</p>
<p>I lifted my spear, watching it emit the blue light  once more. The chains responded instantly and shot out, wrapping the  witch in their grip. There were four chains with one on each limb.  With her hands and legs trapped down, I doubt she could escape this  field and me.</p>
<p>“WHAT? SERVANT!”</p>
<p>“I won’t let you  use Hotaru’s body any longer.”</p>
<p>The chains tightened their  grip and clamped down as the enemy squirmed, reeling in pain as she  tried to set herself free. Her body had already begun to disintegrate  from the inner’s earlier attacks. Now what was left was her demon  form, revealing itself for what she really was.</p>
<p><strong>TUP!  TUP!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“It’s over for you. HAAAAAAAAAAAH!”</p>
<p><strong>SLASH-  FWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“GAAaAaaAaAAAAAAAA!”</p>
<p>Her body broke apart into a cloud of black particles. Almost  immediately did they begin to disintegrate into the air, not willing  to leave a trace of its own existence.</p>
<p>To think…I  promised myself that I wouldn’t cry.</p>
<p><strong>FWOOOOOOSH</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>A  bright light shot out of the air of black particles. What was  happening? Don't tell me I destroyed her too late!</p>
<p><em>‘That’s  not it.’</em></p>
<p><u>Uranus’s POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>There are  some things that will never change, no matter how much you wished  them to. Kaiya shouldn’t have been here. Michiru and myself should  not have gone back to the past yet it all happened. The three of us  from the future are here in the past, watching something that was  already pre-destined.</p>
<p>It’s funny…how nothing we did  really mattered. Despite all of the changes, it’s all happening the  way it should.</p>
<p>Sailor Moon transformed once  more. Her thin figure shoot into the warped sky above, briefly  disappearing. The others were crying out but I remained calm. It will  all end soon.</p>
<p>Soon…Sailor Saturn will  awaken.</p>
<p><strong>FWOOOOOOOOOOSH</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“There she is…” I  mumbled to myself. If I had not known what would happen, then I would  have panicked and thought the world would end. That was what I was  supposed to do, what I’ve done before. What I should have worried  about was making it to this point in time, where everything would  take its natural course.</p>
<p>All of us are nearing  the end of this adventure in life. Yet there will be many more to  come.</p>
<p>“I…and the journeyer from the valley of the  dead…With the blessings of Saturn, the planet of destruction, I am  the scout of Silence…Sailor Saturn.”</p>
<p>“Sis!” I could  hear Kaiya call out. The poor kid was in a state of shock.</p>
<p>I  retreated from my high up position and landed on the ground as did  Michiru and Pluto to gather with the rest of our comrades.</p>
<p>“She’s  not dead Kaiya…Now watch her destiny unfold.” I saw the uncertain  young eyes look back at me.</p>
<p>“Several coincidences piled up  to warp the progress of events…and at some point, history was taken  off course. The fact that all this power has gathered here…and that  all has commenced its descent into destruction…was all  predestined…Now that I have been awakened…I must drop this  Silence Glaive.”</p>
<p>So it will begin…</p>
<p>“Death Reborn  Revolution!”</p>
<p>Always with the end, comes hope and  rebirth…</p>
<p>“Always with the end, comes hope and  rebirth.”</p>
<p>I wrapped one arm around Michiru’s shoulders  and with the other I held Kaiya’s shoulder. For when the blast  comes, we will all need to brace ourselves. As a parent and husband,  it’s my responsibility to protect them. If only I had realized this  earlier. If only I hadn’t been a damn coward and ran away.</p>
<p>Neptune stroked my cheek in a comforting way as if she  knew what I was thinking. “Now, is what matters.”</p>
<p>“My  Father Chronos, guardian of time and space, lend me your power! Close  the breached taboo door! DARK DOOM CLOSE!” Pluto chanted as she  sealed Pharaoh 90 and Sailor Saturn in an alternative  dimension.</p>
<p><u>Neptune’s POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>There was a  brief darkness and then a strong gust of wind. Ruka pulled both Kaiya  and myself closer to her, hugging us both as the force came.</p>
<p>It  did not last long though. When it was all over the buildings around  us began to regenerate to their former state before the incident.  People were being reborn, the people who were caught up in the battle  crossfire or those who had no time to evacuate.</p>
<p>Soon she  will appear again as well.</p>
<p>“Waaaaaah! Waaaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>I  felt Kaiya pull at my arm. “Michiru, am I hearing things, or do I  hear a baby crying?”</p>
<p>“Would you…like to meet your  sister?” I smiled, feeling a bit weary as though I had given birth  all over again. You should have seen Kaiya’s eyes widen.</p>
<p>“You  mean…”</p>
<p>“Come on, I’ll race you there Kaiya!” Ruka  yelled as she took off.</p>
<p>“H-Hey! That’s not fair you know  I’m-”</p>
<p>“Not listening!”</p>
<p><strong>Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!</strong></p>
<p>Both of them still act like children…</p>
<p>Yet I cannot help but wonder…what will happen  now?</p>
