<p><strong>BAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Haruka’s  POV, ballroom</u></p>
<p><u></u><br />
  “Did you hear that?”</p>
<p>“It  sounded like a gun shot!”</p>
<p>“A gun shot? Oh no!” A woman  screamed.</p>
<p>The guests ran about aimlessly, creating more  disorder in an already chaotic situation. I wrapped my arms around  Michi, keeping her close while I tried my best to protect her from  the bumping of bodies. These fools, this isn’t helping anybody! I  searched around the room, over the crowd for an exit. Finally I  spotted one straight ahead of us.</p>
<p>“This way.” I whispered  and tugged my partner towards the side exit. She nodded and followed  lead.</p>
<p><u>Outside</u></p>
<p><u></u><br />
  “What do you think?” I  asked. I had my henshin stick ready in my palm, ready to go if  needed.</p>
<p>Michi closed her eyes and clasped her hands together.  Her Neptunian aura began to emit itself from her body. “Negative  energy…In that direction.” She pointed over to where the gunshot  sounded.</p>
<p>“Then they’ve appeared.” I growled. These Death  Busters have run out of my patience; first they put us though this  load of crap of trying to save the world from the silence, then they  made Michi sick and now they’ve spoil a perfectly good evening.  Who’s life are they trying to ruin besides our now? My hands curled  into fists, shaking at my sides with unmatched hate. They’ll pay.  Every last one of them, I swear it in the name of Uranus.</p>
<p>I  flinched when Michi lightly touched my arm. She looked up at me with  knowing eyes. At least there was someone who understood.</p>
<p>“Ready?”  She whispered.</p>
<p>I eyed the surroundings for a place to  transform. “Over there.” I pointed to the patch of  trees.</p>
<p>“Uranus Planet Power, Make-Up!”</p>
<p>“Neptune  Planet Power, Make-Up!”</p>
<p><strong>FssssSssSsssssh…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>We  dashed out of our cover in the direction Neptune had pointed to  earlier.</p>
<p>“Who do you think the target is this time?” I  gasped.</p>
<p><strong>Tup, tup , tup, tup, tup, tup, tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Another  random civilian most likely.”</p>
<p><strong>Tup, tup, tup, tup, tup ,  tup, tup…</strong></p>
<p>The both of us simultaneously reached another  set of trees, causing me to angrily curse silently; it was difficult  to make anything out in this level of light. Meaning, I had to slow  down and I definitely did not want to slow down to a turtle’s pace.  “Geh…” My eyes attempted to search to my sides as I ran through  the area but every time I shifted my gaze another tree would  forcefully pull my attention back. “Frick!” I growled; I barely  missed another one. Dodging these pieces of bark were beginning to  get on my nerves! Where the hell is this target?</p>
<p>“HOLD  STILL!” Someone shouted ahead.</p>
<p><strong>BAM! BAM! BAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Shots  of light lit up in various directions directly in front of us.</p>
<p><strong>BAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“!”</p>
<p><strong>Thud.</strong></p>
<p>I  threw myself to the ground in time to see one shot blast over me into  the darkness behind me. That…was close. My head shot up as I heard  a small rustle leaving my side, heading to the right. I could barely  make out Michi’s figure fading away. She’s going to circle in? It  was an old formation of ours, meaning I’ve got to get up!</p>
<p>Move!  I commanded my legs.</p>
<p><strong>Tup!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I lunged over to the  left, staying low without letting myself stand to full height as  closed distance. Our enemy’s figure was also barely readable in the  shadows.</p>
<p>“HOLD STILL TENOH!”</p>
<p><strong>BAM!</strong></p>
<p>Tenoh!  My mind froze for a split second; but I was right here, my identity  hasn’t been discovered has it? The fear latched onto me, forcing me  to shake unwillingly. For a moment I could have sworn she was looking  in my direction. There was no way…The anger began to build onto the  old, creating something bigger.</p>
<p>“Shut up!” I lost it.  “World…SHAKING!”</p>
<p><strong>WrrrrrRRrrrrrrrrrrr</strong></p>
<p><strong>BLAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“AhhHh!”  I heard the Death Buster shout.</p>
<p>The entire area was lit in a  flash of golden light. As it did so, I stood up to view what I  normally would not have seen. The target…That’s who she was  looking at!</p>
<p>No way…</p>
<p>A dark figure running this way  had been caught in the light’s embrace, bringing her into full  view.</p>
<p>K-Kaiya?</p>
<p>I stood there feeling numb as the girl  ran by me. Everything seemed to go by in slow motion, as time seemed  to slow itself. Any moment I could seize her arm as each motion  continued through. But I couldn’t, I was stuck. I couldn’t move.  My eyes followed her and saw her give me a quick glance as she ran  by, not seeming to care about my presence but merely acknowledging my  existence.</p>
<p><strong>Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>She’s…the  target. I couldn’t believe it…I fell to my knees. Why now? Why?</p>
<p>“WHY!” My fists slammed into the  ground.</p>
<p>“Deep…SUBMERGE!”</p>
<p>Neptune’s blue light  reflected around the area now.</p>
<p>“Leave now.” I heard  Neptune warn our opponent. “This is your only warning.”</p>
<p>“…Grr…This  isn’t the end, it’s far from over!” The witch growled.</p>
<p><strong>TUP!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I  remained deadly still, unsure of what was happening. It wasn’t a  dream, was it? I buried my head in my hands, pushing back my strands  of blonde hair with desperation.</p>
<p><strong>Tup…tup…tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Michi.”  I mumbled.</p>
<p>“She’s gone…” Michi assured me. “Are you  hurt?”</p>
<p>I immediately shook my head.</p>
<p>“I’m glad…”  She lightly touched my shoulder. “However, this is not the end of  things. Did you see which way the target went?”</p>
<p>“Do you…do  you know who it is?” I lifted my head from my hands. My voice  sounded dead to me, just as I felt.</p>
<p>“…” By her stillness  I knew she didn’t.</p>
<p>“It’s Kaiya, Michi. It’s Kaiya.”</p>
<p>I  heard her gasp. “Are you sure?”</p>
<p>I could only nod dumbly.  For once, I didn’t know what to do. This isn’t a love problem  where I could rely on Kaiya for advice. This was a situation where I  had to choose risking the world over her life. If she did carry a  talisman, I’ll be forced to take it from her and watch her die  before my eyes. An empty shell? Could I see her like that? Allow her  to be reduced her to something so pitiful?</p>
<p>I gathered some  strength and forced myself up. Michi wasn’t going to take this any  better than I was. Perhaps, she’d take it worse…and she hasn’t  fully recovered either.</p>
<p>“Michi?” I called out to her. I  gently felt her out in the darkness until I found her shoulder and  pulled the shaking woman close to me. “It’s okay…I’m here.”  I held her.</p>
<p>“…What will we do?” She whispered.</p>
<p>I  don’t know…Why couldn’t someone tell me? Why couldn’t someone  tell me what to do? The burden of this responsibility bit down as I  struggled over our only two options.</p>
<p>“We have to find her.”  I found my voice and gulped.</p>
<p>Michi’s hold on my outfit  tightened nervously.</p>
<p>“I’m not saying we have to decide now  but we have to at least find her.” I reasoned aloud. “We just  need to be around her more than ever.”</p>
<p>“But how…?”</p>
<p>I  softly pushed Michi back and with one hand, finding it’s way under  her chin I gently tilted it upwards. “I have an idea.”</p>
<p><u>The  next day, Kaiya’s POV, school garden</u></p>
<p><u></u>I leaned back  against the fountain’s marble frame, not caring that I missed  class. The brick ground wasn’t the most comfortable place to sit  on, but at the moment I couldn’t have cared less. It was solid…  it was here…</p>
<p>“Why <em>did</em> I come here?” I asked  myself. I was still tired from last night’s escapade. Although, I  was sure the heat didn’t help much; warm days like these can also  make me sleepy.</p>
<p>The sun was mercilessly beating down with no  clouds whatsoever to provide any shade. I doubted the water in the  fountain was clean enough to drink for that matter.</p>
<p>Stupid…</p>
<p>I  clenched my hands into a small fist, too tired to wipe the beads of  sweat that had begun to form upon my brow. Another few moments passed  where I heard nothing but the running stream behind me. Impulsively I  silently chuckled to myself; who would be stupid enough to be outside  in this weather?</p>
<p>“Obviously me.”</p>
<p>Great, now I was  talking to myself.</p>
<p>I gave out a long, slow sigh and shifted  slightly on the ground, hoping to find a more comfortable position.  ‘This really should be the last thing on your mind’, my inner  voice nagged.</p>
<p>Shouldn’t it? I thought back.</p>
<p>I  grinned. Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus, my parents, were searching  for the holders of the talisman. So were the Death Busters, an  organization of ‘wanting to destroy the world’ weirdoes.  Absent-mindedly I flicked a small pebble by my other hand and watched  it roll a few inches away. The events of yesterday evening came back,  from when I met the Death Buster and onwards.</p>
<p>“It looks like  I’m it.”</p>
<p>It experience felt like another game of hide and  go seek tag. I’m reduced to hiding from the enemy and my parents  (how degrading). Either group would surely seize the opportunity to  kill me if they had the chance; without my heart crystal I would be  good as dead. I’ve seen what happens to victims when they’re  heart crystals are removed. Back with Ami and Makoto…The victims  become empty shells. I’m glad that none of the targets held the  talismans; because of that, ‘we’ were allowed to save them.  However, sooner or later that relief would transform into a void of  panic if time were running out.</p>
<p>…I wonder, being an empty  shell you surely wouldn’t feel any emotion. To not feel hate,  anger, happiness, fear…Wouldn’t that be better for me? I tried to  imagine it for a second. If I was dead then I wouldn’t have to  worry about killing my parents or worrying about going home.</p>
<p>But  logically speaking, what were the chances of that I even held a  talisman? It would definitely suck if I didn’t carry one and died  for nothing. I know I would feel very ticked off if that were the  case; I can’t die until I’ve made my judgement on my parents.  They still aren’t off the hook yet…Besides…Out of all these  people in this world, in this city, what were the chances that I  would carry something everyone is looking for? I couldn’t be that  special. That would be like saying I had a role  here.</p>
<p><strong>FWoOOOOoooOoosh…</strong></p>
<p>A cool breeze?  Wow! This is the first one all day! I sat there lazily as the wind  ruffled my hair and school attire. It feels good…</p>
<p>“So how  does it feel?”</p>
<p>Hm…?</p>
<p>A little girl?</p>
<p>I blinked  back a few times, wondering if I was hallucinating. A little girl now  stood in front of me where there wasn’t anyone a few seconds ago.  As I examined her, I noted how her light blue eyes seemed to glow  back a strange innocent light. Her light blonde hair was cropped  short, similar to Haruka’s with the exception of a few hair clips  keeping the side bangs out of her sight. A kid…I thought to myself  again. And I heard her talk so she’s really here. But she wasn’t  here before was she? I searched my memory. I don’t remember seeing  her here before; I would have surely spotted that dark purple dress  she was wearing. It really sticks out in this scenery.</p>
<p>“Are  you lost?” I asked her from my sitting position.</p>
<p>Her blonde  hair whipped to the side as another breeze shot through the garden,  sending flower petals up into the air. She doesn’t look that old, I  wonder if she can even talk?</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>“…You can  come sit down if you want.” I finally replied and motioned to the  spot beside me.</p>
<p>She took a step forward and then hesitated. A  confused expression appeared across her features. How like a  child…</p>
<p>“I won’t hurt you.”</p>
<p>The girl nodded and  took the seat beside me. She immediately brought her knees up to her  chest and hugged them. I remember I used to do that when I was a kid  too. The sight brought a weak smile to my face. Without thinking  about it, I mimicked the action as well… Before I knew it, the two  of us were exactly in the same pose, looking straight ahead out of  the garden entranceway.</p>
<p>“So…I suppose you don’t know  where your parents are?” I guessed.</p>
<p>To my surprise, she  shook her head. “No, I know where mama and papa are.”</p>
<p>So  she can talk…pretty well in fact.</p>
<p>“But wouldn’t they be  worrying about where you?”</p>
<p>“I’m looking for someone.”  She stated in a soft voice. It sounded lonely…</p>
<p>“A  friend?”</p>
<p>She nodded again. “What about you? Why are you  all alone? Where are your friends?”</p>
<p>The sincerity she  projected in her voice touched me. I almost couldn’t believe the  innocent radiating from this kid; it was hard to believe that all of  us were like this one time or another. Everyone…but me. I can’t  remember what I used to be like; it was so long ago. All I can  remember are the days I spent hiding from the staff members and  training. Only the days where I was alone…Like I am now. I can’t  hang around the gang anymore now that I’m a target. I’ll draw  innocents into the crossfire…</p>
<p>As I thought this, I scanned  the garden to be sure that no one else had followed. If this child  was hurt because of my carelessness, then I…I don’t know what I’d  do.</p>
<p>“I don’t have any friends.”</p>
<p>“Why  not?”</p>
<p>“…Because…some very bad people are after  me…”</p>
<p>“Someone…wants to hurt you?” She gripped my  closest shoulder with both her tiny hands. “Bullies?”</p>
<p>I  couldn’t resist giving a weak smile. In truth I wasn’t sure how  much I should tell this girl…someone her age shouldn’t be  worrying about fighting and death. Even if it were another person’s  story. There will be a time later where she may understand all this,  but…now isn’t the time.</p>
<p>“Yes, very strong  bullies.”</p>
<p>The child pushed her off of my shoulders and  stood up. Slowly she walked around me till she stood directly at my  front.</p>
<p>“I’ll be your friend!” She  declared.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I’ll pinkie swear it. If  those bullies come get you, I’ll protect you.”</p>
<p>I looked  at the outstretched hand with mixed emotions. I know she meant well,  but it was a joke imagining she could hold her own in battle against  my parents or the Death Busters. Uranus and Neptune may not harm the  child and forgive her, but I could see that witch performing cold  murder without a second thought. That bitch…A cold feeling began to  seep throughout my body. If anyone hurts this girl, I WILL kill them  myself.</p>
<p>“Thanks.” I made the pinkie swear with her. “And  if any bullies come after you, I’ll also be there to protect  you.”</p>
<p>“Deal.”</p>
<p><strong>FwwOOOOOooooOSh…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“…”</p>
<p>“…I  have to go now.” She said.</p>
<p>“Okay. I hope you find your  friend.”</p>
<p>The girl nodded. As soon as the contact was  broken, she turned and ran the best she could towards the garden  entrance. When she reached it, she gave on last wave back at me and  disappeared around the corner. I picked myself off the ground and  gave my legs a quick stretch before I sat down onto the fountain’s  ledge.</p>
<p>What an interesting kid…I didn’t expect her to talk  so well at that age; she looked to be about five. Hmm…But now what  should I do? Should I keep running? Should I fight back? Either way I  won’t be able to avoid this collision.</p>
<p>“There you  are.”</p>
<p>Michiru? I almost didn’t see her, I thought as my  eyebrows furrowed. As my friend started to walk this way, I wave of  panic set in as when I met the child earlier. Crap! I shuffled to the  forward slightly till my legs completely touched the ground. My arms  were positioned directly behind my body, ready if I need to make a  quick escape. This isn’t good…Maybe I should go now? Nervously my  hands shook, barely able to support my paralyzed body. If only that  Death Buster had killed me earlier…</p>
<p>Stuck in my own  uncertainties allowed Michiru to make it to me.</p>
<p>“May I sit  with you?”</p>
<p>I nearly fell over backwards into the fountain  from surprise but I caught myself in the nick of time, narrowly  avoiding a watery plunge.</p>
<p>“Uh…actually…” I have to go,  you shouldn’t be near me, I sure hope Haruka won’t show up…the  thoughts raced through my mind silently.</p>
<p>Taking my silence  for a yes, Michiru took a seat next to me. Oddly enough, it wasn’t  me who she was looking at; her eyes were situated at the entranceway  she came in from. Was she waiting for someone? I wondered. Oh, or  maybe she was thinking about that kid?</p>
<p>“…Hey, did you see  that girl?”</p>
<p>“Hm? A girl?”</p>
<p>“You know…the one  with sky blue eyes and light blonde hair.” I pointed to my eyes and  hair for emphasis. “Barely our waist height.”</p>
<p>“Around  here?” Michiru shook her head. “No, I haven’t. You are the  first one I have run into.”</p>
<p>What? I felt my eyes widen. “But  that can’t be. She left just seconds before you showed up.”</p>
<p>Aqua  eyes shone back with amusement. “Then I may have missed her. That’s  too bad…”</p>
<p>“…Do you like kids?”</p>
<p>“Yes. They  are absolutely adorable don’t you think?” She giggled.</p>
<p>Actually  I don’t really know. I haven’t seen too many kids back at home; I  was always in the palace. Even then, I never saw other people my age  until I came here. Sis <em>looks</em> about my age but I know perfectly  well that she isn’t. She’s at least a few hundred years  older…Except in this time of course. Hmm…I think I heard that  there were other kids my age on the other planets but I’ve never  heard about them too much. It never bothered me before but I wonder  what they’re like?</p>
<p>“I guess…” I gave a small shrug.  “They all look cute when they’re little but they sure change when  they become adults.” I’ve met quite a few jerks in my short-lived  life. Trying to imagine all those goons as innocent children almost  boggles the mind, but I know it had to be true at some point.</p>
<p>I  shifted my weight onto my elbows and leaned them against my legs.</p>
<p>“True.” I heard Michiru admit softly. “But it cannot be  helped. People inevitably change as time go on…”</p>
<p>“Mhmm…”</p>
<p>“Just  as you have.”</p>
<p>The comment had taken me aback. “I  have?”</p>
<p>“You certainly are livelier. I think it is wonder  you are being yourself instead hiding away from us.””</p>
<p>“Because  I trust you.”</p>
<p>Michiru blinked a few times and so did I; I  could have sworn her eyes were starting to tear. Did I say something  wrong…? Why does she look sad?</p>
<p>“Hey…”</p>
<p>Haruka  had found us both. As she closed the distance between us and I could  see her face more clearly, I noticed she also harbored the same  solemn expression as Michiru.</p>
<p>“I…I’m sorry, I didn’t…”  Should I apologize? “Maybe I should go now.” The awkwardness made  me uneasy.</p>
<p>I tried to stand but a strong hand pushed me back  into my seat. “You didn’t do anything wrong.” Haruka muttered.  “So relax.” She grinned.</p>
<p>Although she was smiling, I  felt like there was something more behind it. What was truly behind  that cheerful mask was that sad expression. It was still there wasn’t  it?</p>
<p>“Did Michi tell you?”</p>
<p>“Tell me  what?”</p>
<p>“We’re going to start living together.”</p>
<p>My  eyes widened; so soon? “Oh…” Was all I could say.</p>
<p>“All  three of us.”</p>
<p>“WHAT?” I looked at Michiru, hoping she’d  tell me Haruka was joking. “When you say ‘we’re’ don’t you  mean just YOU and HARUKA?”</p>
<p>“Afraid not.”</p>
<p>My  plans for disappearing quietly seem like an impossible dream now.</p>
<p>“Why?” I couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>“Because we  love you soooooo much.” Haruka pinched my cheeks.</p>
<p>“Sway  Wa-at?” Let…go…of. My. Cheek!</p>
<p><strong>Whap!</strong></p>
<p>“Sheesh,  you both are so violent.” Haruka rubbed her hand. “But it doesn’t  matter what you say, we’ve already talked to Rei and she  agreed.”</p>
<p>“…” HUH?</p>
<p>“At least please stay with  us for a week.” Michiru reasoned. “See if you like it. Ruka and  myself thought it might be easier if you came to school with us  instead of busing every morning.”</p>
<p>“Plus we get to spend  more time together!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, like I’d want to spend more  time with you.”</p>
<p>“…No?” The taller blonde narrowed her  eyes. A grin spread across her lips.</p>
<p>“Ruka…Don’t even  think about it!” Michiru began to fidget nervously.</p>
<p>Do  wha-</p>
<p>“AH!”</p>
<p>“Oof!”</p>
<p><strong>SPLOOOsH</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>My  arms shot out, desperately trying to cushion my fall. I didn’t see  that coming! Before I could think I felt one of Haruka’s forearms  wraps hit my upper chest and the next second I was in the fountain!  And by the sound of that scream, it sounds like Michiru got it as  well.</p>
<p>Heavy…The word came to mind. “Get off! Off!” I  shoved a dead weight that had rolled on me onto Michiru.</p>
<p>“Hahahaha!”  Haruka laughed. “Revenge is sweet!” She rejoiced in  victory.</p>
<p>Okay, so I might have dumped a pitcher of water on  her yesterday but what did Michiru do to deserve this?</p>
<p>I  heard Haruka take another plunge after Michiru had shoved the trouble  maker off.</p>
<p>“See?” We both heard the annoying voice again.  “You can’t tell me you wouldn’t want to spend our time together  like this.”</p>
<p>“…” Could one more day really hurt? I  thought about it. “…So I guess that means you and Michiru will be  sharing a room?”</p>
<p>Both their faces blushed bright red. I bet  Haruka is thinking naughty thoughts right now.</p>
<p>“I’m not if  that’s what you’re thinking!” She exclaimed, catching my  accusing stare.</p>
<p>“Sure, whatever helps you to sleep at night.  If you do that is.” I stood up. “But you guys will at least let  me go back to get my stuff right?”</p>
<p>“Of course.” Michiru  promised.</p>
<p>Haruka only nodded. I couldn’t help but think  how easy this was; they were just going to let me go. How do they  know I won’t disappear on them or something? Not that I’m  planning on ditching them now since they’re trusting me this much.  Later for sure; I have to. There’s no doubt in my mind that the  Death Buster is going to come for me very soon. After all, their  organization was desperate enough to attack Makoto twice in one  day!</p>
<p>“Great. Where will I meet you?”</p>
<p>“…” I  saw the two exchange glances. “Oh, you’ll see.”</p>
<p>“You  mean you aren’t going to tell me?”</p>
<p>“You’ll  see…”</p>
<p><u>Hikawa Shrine</u></p>
<p><u></u>I wonder what  they meant by, ‘you’ll see’. Hmm…I slowly walked up the stone  steps to the shrine, still pondering the possibilities. It almost  sounds like I should know the answer…</p>
<p><strong>Tup, tup,  tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Kaiya!” A familiar voice greeted.</p>
<p>“Hi  Rei. So you’ve heard?”</p>
<p>“Of course, they needed my  permission.” The miko put her hands on her hips.</p>
<p>What am I?  Your possession?</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>“So let’s get your  stuff and we’ll go.”</p>
<p>“Go?” Wasn’t I going wherever I  was going to go ALONE? “I’m a bit confused. What do you mean by  ‘we’ll’.” This is starting to feel like déjà  vu.</p>
<p>“You, me and the gang.” Rei side-stepped where I  finally saw the rest of the girls. Ami, Makoto, Usagi and Minako were  all here as well. And from the sounds of it, it wasn’t for another  study session.</p>
<p>“Hi.” They all greeted.</p>
<p>“Didn’t  Haruka and Michiru tell you?” Minako asked.</p>
<p>Tell me  what?</p>
<p>“Haruka and Michiru invited us all to Michiru’s  place for dinner tonight. You know, to hang out and celebrate you  moving out.” Makoto filled me in.</p>
<p>“Food…” Usagi  drooled.</p>
<p>“I always wanted to go to the beach.” Ami smiled.  Usagi nodded in agreement with this comment as well.</p>
<p>“Hey!  I’m not moving out permanently.”</p>
<p>“What, you aren’t  going to miss me are you?” Rei crossed her arms with a smug  smirk.</p>
<p>“On second thought…”</p>
<p>The miko twitched.  “Are you implying something?”</p>
<p>“Nooooo…” Of course  not I inwardly laughed. “Careful Rei-‘chan’, you’ll get  wrinkles if you keep frowning like that.”</p>
<p>“You-”</p>
<p>In  a blur I saw Rei’s friends jump her. “Rei, calm down!” They  cried as they tried to strain the fire breathing miko. She’s  definitely stronger than she looks I mused. Even four other girls her  age and size had trouble holding her back.</p>
<p>“…Fine, I’ll  let her live for now…” She pushed back some of her raven strands  of hair from her face. “Because this way is going to be more  fun.”</p>
<p>Which way?</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry.” Usagi apologized.  “But you won’t be able to wriggle out of this  engagement.”</p>
<p>“EH?”</p>
<p>“We know you have a bad  habit of missing out on get-togethers.” Minako pointed out the  obvious. The rest of her peers nodded, giving their representative a  unanimous agreement.</p>
<p>“Really…?”</p>
<p>All the younger  girls nodded again, grinning broadly. “So don’t even think about  it!”</p>
<p>Grr …I twitched. SO THAT’S WHAT THEY MEANT BY  ‘YOU’LL SEE’! Five against one!</p>
<p>…crappers…</p>
<p><u> Kaiya driving Yuuchiro’s car</u></p>
<p>They really don’t  plan things out very well do they? I gave off a tired sigh as I  relaxed my grip on the wheel. Seriously, if they wanted to drag me  here, having me drive the vehicle wasn’t the best choice. I mean I  could easily turn at this corner and drive in a circle all  day.</p>
<p>“Don’t even think about it.” Rei  growled.</p>
<p>However, seating Rei in the front to keep watch was  a good plan!</p>
<p>“Umm…so where are we going?” I asked. This  sure didn’t look like the route to Michiru’s house; we were still  in the urban city center.</p>
<p>“Turn left.” Usagi ordered as  she leaned forward to point the way.</p>
<p>“Down there?” I  turned the wheel and pushed down on the gas pedal till we pulled up  into another street.</p>
<p>“And stop!”</p>
<p>This is where  they wanted to go? I looked past the gates to see a mansion on the  other side.</p>
<p>“Who’s place is thi?”</p>
<p>“Hotaru’s.”</p>
<p>Suddenly  the house had more meaning to me. Every detail became engraved in my  memory as I scanned the scenery. Neatly trimmed lawn, wide area…looks  like they keep the windows covered as well. I wonder what it looks  like on the inside.</p>
<p>“And we’re here because?”</p>
<p>“To  pick up Rini.”</p>
<p>My eyes widened. Rini? I thought back to  the grown teenager I had met in my earlier years…I was still pretty  young back then, meaning if this is who I think it is, she shouldn’t  know of my existence just yet.</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>Usagi  ranted onwards. “She’s a loud mouthed brat, stubborn, very rude;  she hogs Darien all to herself but I think you two will get  along.”</p>
<p>Ami coughed. “She means Rini really isn’t a bad  kid once you get to know her.”</p>
<p>A color of pink caught my  attention. Speaking of which…</p>
<p><strong>Tup! Tup! Tup!</strong></p>
<p><strong>“</strong>Boy,  you’re late Usagi!” The miniature future moon princess nagged.  She stuck out her tongue rebelliously, purposely egging on  Odango.</p>
<p>“If you had some manners-”</p>
<p>“I don’t  need them.”</p>
<p>“Yes you do! You’re supposed to respect your  elders!”</p>
<p>“Wow…so you’re an old lady now, huh?”</p>
<p>“Gomen  ne, it was my fault.” I interrupted. “I got lost.” Sooner we  got to Michiru’s the sooner I can leave…hopefully. Any argument  will surely slow us down. Being around everyone at once was making me  extremely nervous.</p>
<p>Rini gave me a stare and I stared right  back. She looked very much the same as I remembered her…perhaps a  little more braty…No, a lot more. But something else was bothering  me; Usagi and Rini both gave off this odd feeling. It felt like they  were really close or connected in some way. Which was anything but  normal; Rini came from the future. Why and how was she able to hang  out with Junior High girls? The age difference was too vast.</p>
<p>“How  do you two know each other?” I carefully chose my words.</p>
<p>“She’s  my cousin!” Usagi immediately answered.</p>
<p>Her cousin? The  word ‘impossible’ chimed in my mind.</p>
<p>“Is this true?”  I asked the rest of the Odango’s friends.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“It’s  true.”</p>
<p>“Crazy isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“I mean, just look  at the pigtails. Can’t you see the resemblance?”</p>
<p>So they  all agree to it as well…I looked around at the smiling faces.  Either they were all hiding something from me, or they really did  think Rini was Usagi’s cousin. It’s possible Usagi only told her  friend’s the fact and they believed it in an instant, meaning  they’re off the hook. But Usagi was another matter. She claims to  be related… I slightly narrowed my eyes. Perhaps it’s best to  keep quiet and keep an eye on them.</p>
<p>“I see!” I exclaimed  cheerfully. “You really can see the resemblance.”</p>
<p>“Who’re  you?” Rini butted in.</p>
<p>“Tenoh Kaiya, it’s nice to make  your acquaintance.”</p>
<p>I offered my hand and after a moment’s  hesitation did she return the shake. “Oh, so you’re Hotaru’s  other friend. I’m glad you’re not another dumb blonde like  Usagi.”</p>
<p>I saw the degraded Odango twitching irritably out of  the corner of my eye.</p>
<p>Cute…maybe we will get along after  all.</p>
<p>“Since everyone is going, can Hotaru come too?” Rini  then bluntly asked.</p>
<p>What? NO! I wanted to scream.</p>
<p>“I’m  sure Michiru and Haruka will say it’s all right…if Kaiya  agrees.”</p>
<p>Everyone looked at me. “Eh?”</p>
<p>“Since  you three will to live together, it’s logical that each of you  would require equal privileges, such as inviting guests over to the  same party the three of you are hosting.”</p>
<p>Makoto laughed.  “Ami means that if you give the okay, Haruka and Michiru will  probably agree and it would be fine as well; you know how close  friends are alike.”</p>
<p>I don’t’ know…Haruka probably  won’t like the idea too much…</p>
<p>“Sure, I’m okay with  it.”</p>
<p>‘One step in the grave’ my inner voice nagged me.  Who cares? I might be dead anyway!</p>
<p>A few seconds later, Rini  brought Hotaru back with her.</p>
<p>“N-Nice to see everyone  again.” Hotaru gave a deep bow.</p>
<p>“Aw, there’s no need for  formalities.” I heard Rei inform the younger girl, causing her to  blush pink from embarrassment.</p>
<p>“Sup  Hotaru?”</p>
<p>A smile appeared on the girl’s face. It looked  like she wanted to give me a giant hug but was too lady-like to do it  in front of these people. I gave a small wink, telling her it was all  right; I understood.</p>
<p>“Thank you for inviting me.” She  instead thanked.</p>
<p>“No problem. All right, everyone squeeze in  the back!” I shouted.</p>
<p>There were a few groans and yells  before they finally settled into a somewhat comfortable position.  Minako somehow ended up on Rei’s lap in the front, while Rini sat  on Usagi’s. Everyone else had some seat space. It wasn’t  difficult to see Rini and Usagi’s compromise but…</p>
<p>“Comfortable?”  I teased.</p>
<p>“Shut up and start driving!” Rei snapped  back.</p>
<p>Now aren’t we temperamental? I stepped on the gas  petal.</p>
<p><strong>VvvvRrrrrOoooOOOMMMM…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Back  alley beside Hotaru’s house</u></p>
<p><u></u>Eudialgave a  sinister grin as she watched the group of girls pull out and drove  past her vehicle in waiting.</p>
<p>“There they are.” Her eyes  glared ahead at the car’s driver, focusing on the target’s face.  “Relax while you can…” Eudial smirked. “…Because I will  steal your heart crystal…”</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s POV,  Michiru’s house</u></p>
<p><u></u>I heard Michiru finish up washing  the dishes as I was almost done cutting the fruit. Since we had left  Kaiya, the two of us hustled back to prepare for everyone’s  arrival. We’ve invited Usagi, Minako (which I will be eternally  grateful to for their help yesterday), Makoto, Ami and Rei. I even  said the girls could bring along Rini, apparently a cousin of  Usagi’s. What’s a few more friends going to do?</p>
<p>“Whew.”</p>
<p>I  wiped my brow as the last of the watermelon was finally cut up.  Carefully I scooped the pieces with my two hands and placed them onto  a large tray where various others lay already prepared. Michi being  the artist she was wanted a natural color decoration; so we picked  out some cantaloupe (green and yellow), strawberries, orange and  grapes to go with the watermelon. The veggie platter we just bought  to save some time.</p>
<p>The tap water stopped.</p>
<p>“We found  her…” Michi said softly.</p>
<p>I felt a lump form in my throat.  The natural question was, ‘so now what?’ I wanted to believe we  could live our lives normally…that this all was a dream. Saving the  world was already a difficult task to undertake. I knew that from the  start. But this…Is so cruel. My hands began to shake…Shit…I  don’t want to, I don’t want to watch it all happen and do nothing  about it! Carry a talisman or not, her life would never be the same  afterwards. There will always be the fear of another attack…perhaps  nightmares over something you could never comprehend. Just…another  victim of fate… While I am destined to play the executioner and  perhaps, the murderer of my best friend.</p>
<p>“…We have to take  it.”</p>
<p>Michi spun on the spot and stared at me, her mouth  slightly open. “…”</p>
<p>“It’s our duty. To save the world  from the Silence we must gather three talismans, even though the  holder will die.”</p>
<p>“…Even though she’s our friend?”</p>
<p>I  bit down, feeling my jaw clench. “Yes.” My eyes  steeled.</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. You  don’t have to.” I turned my back to my partner; I can’t let her  see me crumble…I promised. I promised myself that if it came to  this I would be the killer, not her. At least one of us can be spared  the guilt trip. “Leave it to me.”</p>
<p>“Ruka…”</p>
<p>“Hm?  Hey, it looks like they’re here.” I could see the car slowing  down to park in the front through the living room window. “I’ll  go greet them.”</p>
<p>I promise Kaiya, I will never let the Death  Buster’s take your heart crystal! And if you do carry a talisman, I  will kill you myself; you won’t wither away as an empty  shell.</p>
<p>“Hey!” I called out to the car group as they  stepped out of the vehicle. Wow, it’s sure warm today…I walked  out down the small set of steps to meet the group.</p>
<p>“Haruka!”  Minako and Usagi jumped me.</p>
<p>“Oof!” <strong>Thud.</strong> “Nice…to  see you too.”</p>
<p>“Get off!” Rei told her two blonde  friends. “You shouldn’t jump our host.”</p>
<p>Usagi and  Minako exchanged glances. “So…does that mean we can jump you  instead?” They grinned.</p>
<p>“W-Wait a minute I didn-  AH!”</p>
<p><strong>Thud.</strong></p>
<p><u>Michiru’s POV, inside  house</u></p>
<p><u></u>When I heard the roars of laughter I had to see  what was going on. I now peered out of the window to see that Minako  and Usagi had tackled Rei, who was now threatening to beat them both.  I also noticed Haruka was on the ground as well, laughing at the  action-taking place. How did she get down there?</p>
<p>Mentally I  checked our guests off in my mind. It appears that they’re all  here…My heart nearly skipped a beat when I saw Kaiya had arrived as  well. In part I wished she hadn’t come; I was afraid. To spend time  together, to make more memories of the three of us pretending for a  moment life was normal and meant to be enjoyed. Then to have that  false hope shattered. What sort of friend would say she would be  there for her but then try to kill her?</p>
<p>…I cannot let Ruka  do this by herself…I know she means well, but we agreed to do this  together…</p>
<p><strong>Slam.</strong></p>
<p>I looked up in time to see our  guests entering the house.</p>
<p>“Welcome.” I greeted. Ara?  There appears to be one extra…</p>
<p>“Oh, Michiru, I invited a  friend. Is that all right?” Kaiya asked.</p>
<p>“Of course.” I  couldn’t see why not.</p>
<p>“I am Tomoe Hotaru. It is a  pleasure to meet you.” She gave a slight bow. What a well-mannered  girl…She seems to be quite a bit more reserved than the older girls  I noted compared to Usagi and Minako’s greeting style. Out of my  peripheral vision I saw Kaiya and Haruka exchange argumentative  glances. Why were they glaring at each other?</p>
<p>“My name is  Kaioh Michiru, the pleasure is all mine.” The younger girl blushed  lightly at the attention and merely nodded. I then turned to the  others. “I’m glad you all could make it. Would you like to  explore the beach? It’s right outside. I can call you when dinner  is ready.”</p>
<p>“Yeah!” They all nodded.</p>
<p>I noticed  how Kaiya was hesitant and remained silent. It would be best if she  had some fun too, I reasoned. What awaited her would be nothing of  the sort after all.</p>
<p>“There isn’t much left to do, I can  handle it myself.” I informed Ruka. She gave me a questioning look  but quickly understood.</p>
<p><em>‘Keep a watch on her.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘I  will.’</em></p>
<p>“Then I will see you later.” I said as I  waved them off.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you bet”</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s  POV, beach</u></p>
<p><u></u>“I vote volleyball!”</p>
<p>“But mina  chan, you’re the only one good at it.” Usagi whined.</p>
<p>“I  say why not.” Haruka joined in.</p>
<p>“But you’re tall.”  Usagi complained again. “What do you think?” She asked me. There  were teary baby-blue eyes begging me to agree with her, but I had a  funny feeling that she’d object to any sport Minako would suggest.</p>
<p>“Umm…” I glanced over to Rei, seeing the miko mentally  preparing herself to cream Usagi; she seemed to be going over the  spiking technique with unrestrained gusto. Makoto on the other hand  seemed to be trying to convince Ami that the game would be a lot of  fun for everyone. “Tell you what, you can be the setter for  whichever team you play for. You don’t need to be tall for  that.”</p>
<p>Usagi pouted at the response, clearly dissatisfied.</p>
<p>“Let’s see, seven…nine? Hotaru, Rini, are you two going  to play?” Haruka asked.</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>“Of course we  are!” Rini answered for them both.</p>
<p>“Okay, Haruka’s on  the other side.” I declared.</p>
<p>“Fine!” She smirked back.  “Now I can cream you!”</p>
<p>“In your dreams.”</p>
<p>The  game finally begun with the two following teams: 1) Haruka, Usagi,  Rini, Makoto vs. 2) Me, Hotaru, Minako, Rei and Ami</p>
<p>Since we  had the extra player we gave Haruka’s team the first serve.</p>
<p>“All  right.” Haruka laughed. “Here it comes. HA!” She  grunted.</p>
<p><strong>Wham!</strong></p>
<p>“I’ve got it!” Minako cried  as the ball headed in her direction. It was a clear, easy pass up to  me.</p>
<p>I ran under the ball and quickly bent down into  position. “Over here!” I heard Rei call. Without hesitation I  sent it to the miko.</p>
<p>“Usagi!” Haruka shouted to Odango.  Usagi looked a little lost at what was going on.</p>
<p>“Wha-”</p>
<p>“Head’s  up!” Rei growled.</p>
<p><strong>WHAM!</strong></p>
<p>Ouch, right in the  face!</p>
<p>“Point one is ours!” Minako and Rei shouted as they  gave each other high fives.</p>
<p>“They…sure are competitive  aren’t they?” I asked Hotaru. She merely nodded her head,  suddenly looking a little frightened of Rei.</p>
<p>“You get used  to it.” Ami sighed.</p>
<p><u>A bit later, game point</u></p>
<p><u></u>Haruka  was winding up for the last serve of the set. Both teams had been  previously tied throughout. We had just lost the last point and  Haruka’s team was now one up. If they win this point they win the  set.</p>
<p>“Neh…” A small gasp caught my attention. I looked  over to Hotaru. Her hands had come up to her chest and she seemed to  be gasping for breath.</p>
<p>“Hotaru?”</p>
<p>“YAH!” I heard  Haruka yell.</p>
<p><strong>Whack!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The serve headed her  direction. Look out!</p>
<p><strong>WHUP!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I hit the sand,  feeling everything spinning. “Ouch…” When I tried to stand, my  legs seemed to have trouble balancing and there was a strange ringing  in my ears. Tiredly I allowed myself to sit back down till the  nauseous feeling went away. Oof…</p>
<p>“Are you all  right?”</p>
<p>“Kaiya?”</p>
<p>People were all around me but I  only heard one voice. “Hotaru!” It was Rini. I tried to look up,  spotting where the two youngest girls were huddled. Hotaru?</p>
<p>“Yeah,  I’m fine.” My thoughts wandered back to Haruka’s last serve.  Was she deliberately aiming at Hotaru? There was… something uncanny  about that aim.</p>
<p>I forced myself up and walked over to where  Rini and Hotaru were.</p>
<p>“Is she all right?” I asked Rini. I  noticed how Hotaru seemed to be gasping somewhat still; she might be  overheating! I instantly panicked. “You guys keep playing, I’ll  take care of Hotaru.” I told the others. At first they protested  but I refused; they should be having fun and relaxing.</p>
<p>“No.  we can stop the game! It can wait.”</p>
<p>“No, you guys keep  going. It’s okay, really. We’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>I carefully  lifted Hotaru onto my back and started walking to the other end of  the beach. We both could probably use some space and quiet.</p>
<p>“Wait,  I’ll come with you Kaiya!” Haruka ran up by my side.</p>
<p>“I’ll  be all right.” I assured her.</p>
<p>“But-”</p>
<p>“I can  take care of myself…” I heard the other girls call Haruka,  waiting to start the game again. “See you later.”</p>
<p><strong>Tup,  tup, tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Further down the Beach</u></p>
<p>I  jumped up onto a base of rocks that lay slightly up and away from the  waters below. This looks like a good place to rest; it’s almost  like that spot back at home, bringing back the few fond memories of  that time. Slowly I let Hotaru down, resting her against the back of  the rocky wall before I sat beside her so she could lean against me  for support. The wind, I noticed, was stronger here. At least we  won’t bake, I thought.</p>
<p>‘I’m sorry…”</p>
<p>“You’re  awake?”</p>
<p>“…” Hotaru nodded.</p>
<p>“It’s all right,  don’t blame yourself. You can’t help it.” She can’t help it  if her body is weaker than others…</p>
<p>“But still…I dislike  being such a burden…” I watched her push herself off my shoulder,  almost collapsing again.</p>
<p>“It’ll get better.” I pulled  her back down. She should wait until she’s strong enough  first…</p>
<p>“What if it doesn’t?”</p>
<p>“It will.”</p>
<p>“I  wish I could be as confident as you are…”</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>“Say,  do you have a dream?” I suddenly asked; she was always so busy back  at home managing the thrones…But it couldn’t have been because  she wanted to. I’ve always wondered but I was too much of a coward  to ask.</p>
<p>“I want to become a doctor.”</p>
<p>A doctor? Now  the guilt began to set in; she was forced to become a business woman  because of my helplessness. That’s far from the spectrum of being a  doctor. And she had to suffer this much here as well!</p>
<p>“It’s  a silly dream isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“It’s not!” She turned her  head. “If you have a dream, you go for it no matter what it is.”  I desperately wanted to say I was sorry as well but I held my  tongue.</p>
<p>“…What about you?”</p>
<p>“Me…? My dream…”  I looked away, “Won’t ever come true.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>A  thought of my parent’s and me appeared in my head. Only, I saw them  disappear one by one, till I was the only one left in the picture.  Then I saw myself meeting my end at the hands of Uranus in this time,  my most likely future. If she doesn’t…then I’ll probably kill  them instead…All I could see was blood in our future…</p>
<p>“I  guess it’s fate.” I smiled.</p>
<p><strong>Ping!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Huh? That  energy…I slowly looked around trying to sense the presence. Getting  closer…Heh, so this will be it will it? I thought back to the  little girl I had met in the school garden earlier. The bully is  coming for me.</p>
<p>“Hotaru, can you make it back on your  own?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Do you know your way back? You  just have to walk straight down this strip. It’s about a five  minute walk.”</p>
<p>“You aren’t coming?”</p>
<p>“I’ll be  there in a bit…”</p>
<p>She hesitated. “…Promise?” There  was a worried look in her eyes. For a moment I wondered if she could  sense something was wrong as well.</p>
<p>“Promise. Pinkie  swear.”</p>
<p>After we made our promise I watched the girl jog  off. She stopped to walk a few times but that was all right; she was  well out of sight before I knew it.</p>
<p>Now I only have to wait…I  sighed.</p>
<p>…Thanks for everything Hotaru…</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s  POV, volleyball game</u></p>
<p><u></u><strong>Ping!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>What?</p>
<p>“Don’t  look away!” I quickly turned back in time to see Rei spike another  hit. Reflexively I managed to get a touch. The ball bounced off the  back of my forearm and back up to where Usagi was waiting. It was a  perfect set.</p>
<p>“Ha!” Makoto slammed it back.</p>
<p>“Hey,  you touched the net!”</p>
<p>“What? No way, you two did  first.”</p>
<p>“Carry on without me.” I told Usagi as the three  other girls argued about who touched the net first.</p>
<p>“Are you  going somewhere?</p>
<p>“To check on Kaiya. I’ll be  back.”</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I had started to sprint in the  direction where I saw Kaiya headed last. That wasn’t a good  feeling!</p>
<p>“Hah…hah...” Damn it’s hard to run in this  sand!</p>
<p>Then my vision started to darken around me, meaning only  one thing.</p>
<p><em>‘Something’s wrong.’ </em>I heard Michiru  call me.</p>
<p><em>‘I know…Stay where you are, I’ll check it  out.’</em></p>
<p>“Hah! Hah!”<br />
  <strong>Tup! Tup! Tup!  Tup!</strong></p>
<p><em>‘But…’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Take care of the girls  over there; there may be more than one attack.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘…Be  careful…’</em></p>
<p>“Hotaru?” I saw the recognizable  black figure walking this way. She looked up as I called her name,  looking confused at my noticeable distress.</p>
<p>When I made it to  her she stopped but did not speak; nervousness played all over her  facial features. I admit I wasn’t the most gentleman like person  when we last met but there was definitely something wrong with her.</p>
<p>Still on guard I asked, “Have you seen Kaiya?”</p>
<p>“…”  She nodded.</p>
<p>“Which way? It’s important.”</p>
<p>Slowly  she pointed to the direction she was returning  from.</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p><strong>VvvrrrrrrrROoooOoM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>A  black cat sped by ahead in Hotaru’s indicated direction on the road  above. I braced myself as the dust from its tires kicked up and blew  down where we stood. It couldn’t be…Shit!</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s  POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>It’s getting cloudy all of the sudden. As I  looked up I noticed the sun was becoming almost continually covered  from the massive gray clouds. They weren’t storm clouds but  something different…they had an air of power to them. If I had the  time I could sit out here admiring them all day. It was…almost  mesmerizing.</p>
<p><strong>VVRROOOOooomm.</strong></p>
<p><strong>…</strong>So she’s here.  I stood up and jumped off the base of rocks onto the soft sand below,  forcing the witch to come meet me on lower ground if she wished to  confront me. Still waiting, I eyed the black vehicle door open and  watched the red haired woman slowly get out. She was radiating  confidence as she carried a large gun by her side. Too bad she can’t  hit moving targets, I inwardly smirked.</p>
<p>“This time you won’t  get away.” She laughed. Her eyes flashed as she took her sweet time  walking over to the pathway that led downwards.</p>
<p><strong>Tup…tup…tup…</strong></p>
<p>She  stepped closer.</p>
<p>I decided. I won’t fight. Even if I should  die, I also need to know. If I truly do hold a talisman, Uranus and  Neptune would need to take it from me eventually. I can only hope  that they will come this time if they should need to take  it…</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>I saw the witch  descend the path down onto the sand, her smug strides made me quiver  with increasing hate. Each step she took towards Kaiya made me burn  with anger. Automatically my right leg stepped forward, sensing my  longing to run out and smack that bitch down but I held back. Damn…I  can’t transform; there’s no place to hide. I clenched my fists in  frustration. If I do, I’ll surely be discovered.</p>
<p><strong>Tup…tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The  footsteps seemed to go one forever! Finally the Death Buster made it  to ground. I stared out past her shoulder to catch a glimpse of  Kaiya, expecting the girl to be cowering in fear. Instead I was  surprised to see her face completely calm.</p>
<p>Kaiya?</p>
<p>She  had this serious expression on her face but it was nothing of the  like to be classified as fear. My muscles strained and tightened. No!  I commanded my body. I have to wait…</p>
<p>“Geh…”</p>
<p><em>‘Until  she’s shot right?’</em> I heard my inner voice ask. Yes…There’s  no other way! I despaired. <em>‘She could die…’</em> We all die  at some point. <em>‘But not all people are murdered by you.’</em> I  choked back a gasp and closed my eyes tightly. The memory of my  father brutally murdering my mother came flooding back. Everything I  felt then…The anger, sorrow, sadness and hatred…</p>
<p><em>‘You’ll  be just like him.’ </em>I’ll…become like him? The thought struck  deep down. But it’s not the same thing! I argued back. To save the  planet from the Silence we need those talismans!</p>
<p><em>‘Come  on, don’t look so serious. It’s not you.’</em></p>
<p>This time  it was Kaiya’s voice that echoed through my head. We never got  along when we first met…I remember having to chase her down the  first day just to talk to her. Then we had that stupid disguise bet  where Michi and I found out she couldn’t swim. Teaching her to  swim…Kaiya picking those flowers for Michi everyday…the images  won’t stop! I grabbed my head and brought it to my knees, trying to  stop the downpour of memories. Just shoot her already, I wanted to  scream! My inner voice shouted, <em>‘Don’t! Leave her  alone!’</em></p>
<p>“Die.”</p>
<p><strong>BAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“AHHHHHHH!”</p>
<p><strong>FwOoOOoowOooosh!</strong></p>
<p>My  head slowly came up as the expected light filled the entire area. I  did it…I allowed it to happen, did my duty…but… I didn’t feel  proud of it. It made me…sad.</p>
<p>I watched in awe as the light  condensed together into a tiny limited sphere, in its center was the  heart crystal. It looked ordinary until it started to spark and then  transform.</p>
<p>Don’t be it!</p>
<p><strong>Crackle, CrAcKle.  Fwooooooosh.<br />
</strong>Is…that a talisman? I wasn’t sure;  Kaiya’s heart crystal had transformed into a huge rock slab, a  meter and a half in length. It remotely resembled a thick rectangular  sword with a small handle on one end, only made of uneven boulder  mass.</p>
<p>“What is that thing?” The witch wrinkled her nose in  disgust. “How ugly. No way that could be a talisman… Oh well.”  She shrugged. “Guess…I can get rid of it then.” She gave a  large, insane smirk. She lifted her gun up and aimed it at the  suspended object.</p>
<p>She’s going to destroy it! I realized.  But…I can’t transform!</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV</u></p>
<p>It’s  cold…I tried to move but I found I couldn’t; everything had  become too numb, I couldn’t feel my limbs anymore. My eyes looked  on forward onto objects that had become mere shadows in my vision.  All the color had died away. So…this is what it felt like to be  dying. It’s worst than I thought it would be, disappearing this  way. I can still feel emotions…nothing I expected. You don’t lose  your soul when you lose your heart crystal, only your life.</p>
<p>My  skin tingled when the light above hit it, making me wish I could see  what my crystal had become. Was it still normal? Had it changed?  Where was Uranus and Neptune?</p>
<p>Lonely…Something inside made  me want to cry.</p>
<p>Damn!</p>
<p>“Guess what kid? I’m going to  kill you now.” I heard the witch step forward and pointed her gun  to a spot directly over me. Instinctively my mind panicked and tried  to lunge, make some evasive movement but nothing. All of my training  has effectively gone to waste with my immobility. “How does it feel  to be helpless?”</p>
<p>I growled but only a small noise escaped my  throat. In response the woman kicked me in the face.</p>
<p><strong>Whup!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Oof!  I inwardly groaned. Spots began to appear in front of my eyes.</p>
<p>“See  you.”</p>
<p>…What was left of my heart beat raced again for a  split second.</p>
<p><strong>TUP! TUP!</strong></p>
<p><strong>BAM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“AHHHHH!”</p>
<p>…Haruka?</p>
<p>An  intense light lit the area as Haruka’s body hit the ground in front  of me.</p>
<p>What? W-why?</p>
<p><strong>FwOoOooOOOSH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“A  talisman!” I heard the witch cry out.</p>
<p>I don’t give a shit  about the talismans anymore. Haruka! I tried to move but couldn’t.  I couldn’t even wriggle. Involuntarily tears began to form in my  eyes. Everything stung. My vision became nearly non existent. You  weren’t supposed to get involved! You idiot!</p>
<p>Someone, save  Haruka! I was desperate now. Uranus, Neptune, where the hell are  you!</p>
<p>The Death Buster took a step towards Haruka, her arms  beginning to outstretch.</p>
<p>“Well, what to you know? I find a  treasure with a dud”</p>
<p>DON’T TOUCH IT!</p>
<p><strong>SHINK!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“W-What?”  She staggered back.</p>
<p>Something was on the ground now. I felt  the presence snake it’s way around my waist, slowly lifting my body  from the ground. All feeling suddenly came back to me. My sight  became focused and my breathing was returning to normal. Testily I  moved my fingers. They tingled from the sudden rise in temperature  change. I still harbored a bit of a headache from the blow but it was  the last thing on my mind; something else was happening.</p>
<p>A  huge mass of power poured into me. Orange light…I blinked. And…a  long orange glowing chain. Instead of feeling extreme panic at the  sight, I was at peace. It was here in my life, not inside of me  anymore. But…how? I watched the chain marked a multi-layer like  fence perimeter separating Haruka and myself from the Death Buster.  The talisman and my heart crystal were now out of her grasp.</p>
<p>The  red headed woman snarled in anger; her luck had run out.</p>
<p><em>‘I  pinkie sweared…that if those bullies come to get you, I’ll  protect you’</em></p>
<p>“It’s you…”</p>
<p>The girl I had  met earlier now stood directly in front of me. What are you? Who are  you? I wanted to ask. But somehow I felt that I knew the answer. She  had been here all along.</p>
<p><em>“Take it back.”</em></p>
<p>The  end of the chain that held my transformed heart crystal brought it  close to my chest where it began to meld back into  me.</p>
<p><strong>FwOOOOooooOOOSH</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I was dropped to the  ground. My legs felt weak upon contact but I somehow managed to stand  on my own.</p>
<p>“I said leave it alone.” I growled.</p>
<p>“No  way! That’s m-” She suddenly held her tongue.</p>
<p>A flash of  anger tore through me. The chain seemed to respond and posed to  attack. It threateningly hovered around myself along with the little  girl. The Death Buster tried to aim her gun. In slow motion the gun  was being whipped around…and then the chain suddenly made it’s  move.</p>
<p><strong>FWOOOOO-SHINK!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“GAH!”</p>
<p>Her  battered body was launched upwards until it landed on her car with a <strong>thunk </strong>and bounced limply off. I watched the woman slowly drag  herself up and then desperately fumble into the vehicle, most likely  hoping for some sort of protection.</p>
<p>Just get out of my sight,  I glared.</p>
<p><strong>SCREEEECH. VRRRRRoooOOOOM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I waited  until the car was out of view before I focused my attention to the  matter at hand.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>‘You have to decide what to do  about her’. </em></p>
<p>You mean Haruka ? Is…it really a  talisman?</p>
<p><em>‘Yes. It is the space sword of Uranus.’</em></p>
<p>What!  But why would Haruka have that? The girl didn’t respond. The  talisman are supposed to be in three different holders…does that  mean Uranus will take it from Haruka? Or…No, it couldn’t be that!  It can’t be! She couldn’t be Uranus. Uranus would have left me to  die! But the flash back of Uranus catching me before I fell during  the water plant infiltration brought another wave of doubt. I felt  sick.</p>
<p><em>‘What will you do? Her life is in your  hands.’</em></p>
<p>…Isn’t it obvious? I’m giving it back to  her.</p>
<p><em>‘What about your identity as Rai? Wasn’t it your  mission to gather the talismans as well?’</em></p>
<p>Am I Rai right  now? I silently thought.</p>
<p><em>‘And if she really was  Uranus…’</em></p>
<p>She’s not! I shook my head violently. The  little girl gave me a pitying look. I’m going to return it and  that’s final.</p>
<p>I walked over to the space sword and  carefully lowered it back to Haruka.</p>
<p><strong>FwoOOoOOOOOSH</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>When  the light disappeared, the girl and chain had also  vanished.</p>
<p>“Haruka?” I softly shook her. My only reply was  a soft groan.</p>
<p>It occurred to me then that Haruka might take a  bit longer to return ‘to life’; she had been out in this state  longer than I have.</p>
<p>“Guess I’m carrying you.”</p>
<p>I  felt my muscles strain under me as I threw one of her arms over my  shoulders and started to drag her back.</p>
<p>“Or drag.” I  joked. It was a shame she couldn’t talk back, we could’ve argued  the entire way…Oh well…One thing was for sure, she’s going to  be a little sore the next day…</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s POV, later  that evening in their bedroom</u></p>
<p><u></u>“And that’s what I  saw.” Ruka rubbed her neck sorely. “It was like…it was dead, it  had no life force to it.”</p>
<p>“A dead talisman?” That would  be the equivalence of saying Kaiya’s heart was also dead, which has  to be impossible; she has so many friends here.</p>
<p>“Although,  the granite was pretty battered. I’m not sure what to think of it  but it surely couldn’t be what we’re looking for…”</p>
<p>I  breathed a soft sigh. “We don’t know that. There aren’t  supposed to be four talismans. …No one informed us what they would  look like if we did encounter one…”</p>
<p>“Ruka?  Something wrong?”</p>
<p>She shook her head slowly, clearly  something else was on her mind. “It’s nothing.” Perhaps the  situation concerning Kaiya still made her uneasy I reasoned.</p>
<p>“We’ll  get through this.” I gave her a comforting hug.</p>
<p>“Of  course.” Ruka whispered. She left my embrace to bury herself under  the quilts and turned away. “Night.”</p>
<p>I stared up at the  ceiling for a few minutes wondering how much more complex this was  going to become. Hopefully…not too much.</p>
<p>…“Good  night.”</p>
