Juri Arisugawa relaxed by the bar, though in truth
that relaxation was a illusion. As the owner and
manager of the bar the orange haired woman&#39;s eyes
swept the room, monitoring the women, feeling the tone
of the room and being ready to move at a moment&#39;s
notice.

The library was well populated tonight as Yomiko
Readman lead a tour of college students through the
rare books they had acquired, the dance floor pulsed
and moved as women bumped and ground, the kareoke
stage was occupied by one boozy singer after another
and the caf&eacute; style tables were packed with women
eating merrily.

&quot;You seem tense,&quot; Setsuna Meiou murmured to her wife,
the green haired older woman reaching out to massage
Juri&#39;s shoulders.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Juri smiled at her apologetically, &quot;there&#39;s
been a odd feeling in the air, and I&#39;m not sure I like
it.&quot;

&quot;That raid still bothers you?&quot; Setsuna asked.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Juri frowned in agreement, &quot;that and what
happened to Keiko...&quot;

Less than a week ago, a band of armed men had
attempted to break into the bar chasing after a
customer, claiming they were affiliated with something
called SHIELD. Making things worse they were trained
in fighting superhuman foes, and if it hadn&#39;t been for
the customers pitching in the staff of the bar could
have lost the fight.

Setsuna smiled down at her comfortingly, &quot;It was just
one variant possible world, there&#39;s no telling if
we&#39;ll ever encounter it again, and I&#39;m sure May&#39;s
pampering Keiko right now.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re not that lucky,&quot; Juri said wryly.

&quot;Lighten up, boss,&quot; Minagi noted as she delivered a
fresh colored gingerale to her. The blue haired space
pirate with the cheek scars lingered a moment, &quot;We got
a bit soft, but it&#39;s not going to happen again. Ryouko
and I are already drilling the staff.&quot;

&quot;Even Alpha?&quot; Setsuna blinked in surprise, thinking of
the seemingly meek and mild green haired android.

&quot;Actually, she&#39;s a crack shot with a pistol,&quot; Minagi
informed them, &quot;Mahoro has lent Alpha her spare gun,
and I wouldn&#39;t want to run into Alpha with that at her
side.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Juri conceded, looking up as she
noticed a group of young women coming up the hallway
from the outer doors.

Excel Excel smiled cheerfully at the three young women
as the blonde haired woman said, &quot;Welcome to
Arisugawa&#39;s Locket. Can I take your coats?&quot;

&quot;I suppose,&quot; Saya Otonashi said, the dark brown haired
young woman shrugging off her coat, &quot;I understand this
place is neutral territory?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll be perfectly safe,&quot; Excel smiled cheerfully.

&quot;We&#39;ve got a sword with us,&quot; Mao Jahana said, carrying
the modified weapon&#39;s case with surprising ease, &quot;do
we keep it with us or...?&quot;

Hyatt leaned against the wall, bone pale as the black
haired woman noted, &quot;We&#39;d prefer you turn in weapons
at the bar.&quot;

Kaori Kinjou smiled as the light brown haired athlete
said, &quot;Then that&#39;s what we&#39;ll do.&quot;

&quot;Have fun,&quot; Hyatt waved as they made their way through
the crowds up to the bar.

&quot;Interesting place you&#39;ve brought us to,&quot; Mao noted
dryly as she looked up to meet her Queen&#39;s eyes. Ever
since Saya had shared her chirotopean blood with Mao
to heal what would have been a deadly injury Mao had
become one of her cavaliers, something both of them
were still adapting too.

Saya smiled back wryly as she protested, &quot;Hey, I&#39;ve
never been here before!&quot; She gestured to the third
member of their trio as she added, &quot;It was Kaori who
picked it out for us.&quot;

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Mao looked over at Kaori thoughtfully as
she askedher fellow cavalier, &quot;You wouldn&#39;t be trying
to tell us something, would you?&quot;

&quot;No, I am not,&quot; Kaori answered, but a blush tinged her
cheeks.

Saya fought back a chuckle as they reached the bar,
waiting just a moment for the bartender to reach them.
&quot;Hiya,&quot; Minagi gave them her most engaging smile as
she asked, &quot;what can I do for you?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve got a weapon to turn in,&quot; Saya nodded to Mao
who hefted the disguised sword case up onto the bar.

&quot;Always, ma&#39;am,&quot; Minagi nodded respectfully, picking
up the weapon and reverently putting it away.

&quot;Welcome to the bar,&quot; Juri nodded as she sipped from
her ginger ale, &quot;I&#39;m the host, Juri Arisugawa.&quot;

&quot;You have a very interesting bar,&quot; Mao noted, taking
in the library, kareoke stage and busy stairs going up
to the second floor.

&quot;We try,&quot; Juri chuckled softly.

&quot;Anything to drink?&quot; Minagi asked them as she tossed a
can of beer to a customer waving from up the bar..

&quot;Wine,&quot; Mao said, dropping a large bill on the bar.

Kaori chuckled, &quot;Sake for me.&quot;

There was a soft gurgling rumble and both young woman
looked at Saya. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she sighed, &quot;do you think I
could get something to eat, first?&quot;

Setsuna gave them a sympathetic smile as she said,
&quot;I&#39;m sure our kitchen can make you up a snack.&quot;

&quot;Better make it a meal,&quot; Kaori said, &quot;Saya may be
small, but she eats like a horse.&quot;

&quot;Kaori!&quot; Saya blushed even brighter.

Juri and Setsuna watched Saya and her friends carry
their drinks over to one of the dining tables as May
hurried over to serve them. &quot;Ah, young love,&quot; Alpha
noted, the green haired android carrying a tray of her
specialty coffee.

&quot;Not exactly young,&quot; Juri noted. As Alpha gave her a
questioning look she added, &quot;A similar looking girl
came in a while ago... she claimed to have fought
monsters in both World War II and Vietnam.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s a android?&quot; Alpha guessed.

&quot;Or some other kind of immortal,&quot; Setsuna agreed.
&quot;There are a lot of types of people possessing long
life spans,&quot; she explained, &quot;and not all of them are
nice.&quot;

Alpha nodded seriously, &quot;I&#39;ll keep an eye on her.&quot;

&#39;Not quite what I intended,&#39; Setsuna thought as she
looked over the crowd, &#39;but it&#39;ll do.&#39; Her eyes
widened as a black haired woman in military style gear
walked in, &quot;Juri, trouble.&quot;

&quot;I see her,&quot; Juri responded, recognizing the uniform
as matching that of the agents who had tried to attack
the bar. She noted the antagonistic vibe from the
patrons and nodded as Mahoro left the kitchen to see
what was happening, &quot;Can you bring her to me?&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Mahoro headed off any of the customers from
interfering with the woman and lead her up to where
Juri was sitting.

&quot;I&#39;ve had friendlier greetings,&quot; the woman noted as
she reached the bar.

&quot;Some of these people had friends hurt when your goon
squad attacked last week,&quot; Juri answered flatly. &quot;Who
are you, and what do you want?&quot;

&quot;My name is commander Maria Hill,&quot; she responded
coolly, &quot;I&#39;m the second in command of the Strategic
Hazard Intervention, Espionage Logistics Directorate.&quot;

&quot;I guess that explains the cute shield logos on the
troops who tried to invade my place of business, shot
innocent people and,&quot; Juri suddenly roared, &quot;HURT ONE
OF MY STAFF!&quot;

Maria Hill jerked backward even as the bar went dead
silent. &quot;SHIELD troops were here in persuit of a
wanted fugitive,&quot; she responded, &quot;and we tried to use
minimal force.&quot; After a moment&#39;s pause she continued,
&quot;How is the injured woman?&quot;

&quot;Keiko Sonada&#39;s recovering at home with her lover,
May,&quot; Setsuna said dryly, &quot;no thanks to your people.&quot;

Juri got her temper under control, though it took some
effort. &quot;I want you and your organization to
understand something,&quot; she said flatly, &quot;this bar is
neutral territory, and we have the power to enforce
that.&quot;

Maria Hill looked unhappy, but nodded. &quot;Our psionics
division has already briefed me on the unique nature
of your bar,&quot; she admitted, &quot;and Director Stark
doesn&#39;t feel our mandate extends across alternate
worlds.&quot;

Setsuna&#39;s lips twitched up slightly, &quot;And you don&#39;t
want to make yet another powerful enemy, correct?&quot;

&quot;That too,&quot; Maria willingly conceded. She looked at
Juri, &quot;I hope you&#39;ll pass on my apologies to Keiko,
and let your people know we won&#39;t attack again.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do that,&quot; Juri said flatly.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; and with that Maria walked to the door,
back straight and head high.

&quot;Damn, I was almost hoping for a rematch,&quot; Minagi
muttered as her sister Ryouko teleported in, the
unscarred woman looking amused.

&quot;You might get it,&quot; Ryouko noted, &quot;I don&#39;t trust her.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t trust anyone who looks like a cop,&quot; Juri
noted wisely.

Ryouko frowned, &quot;So what? Cops can&#39;t be trusted!&quot;

Setsuna chuckled softly as she looked at Juri, &quot;Do you
think they&#39;ll attack again?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Juri admitted, &quot;but there&#39;s no harm in
being on guard.&quot;
