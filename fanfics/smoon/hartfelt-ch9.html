<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 9 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><p>…<b>Beep…beep...beep…</b></p><p>…<b>tup, tup…</b></p><p><u>(Infirmary, Palace of 
Jupiter)</u></p><p>In a single-bedded chamber, Rei, Ami and Minako were all gathered around 
the bed with grim expressions. Doctors and nurses were frantically rushing in and out of the 
room as shouts of status reports were exchanged. The palace had been thrown into a state of 
chaos ever since their arrival. The soldiers were undeniably furious, and the palace 
attendants had watched pale-faced and aghast at the sight of their bloodied, unconscious 
leader. They had passed several sobbing elderly women in the corridors on their way to the 
infirmary. The only people who were left in the dark of these recent turn in events was 
Jupiter’s citizens. However, if the information had been made public, inevitably the people 
would have broken out into the streets in riot and curse the sinner of this outrageous 
act.</p><p><b>Tup! Tup! Tup!</b></p><p>The fifth nurse in the last five minutes had entered 
the room. Ami nervously glanced up at the young woman who was now recording Makoto’s blood 
pressure. The mixture of relief and anxiety on her face exactly mirrored how she felt, but 
unlike the others her hands were stained.</p><p><i>I caused this...</i> Tears began to well 
up in Ami’s eyes. <i>This is my fault! </i>Even now, her memory was still a blur. The last 
thing she recalled was the ground shaking, and then, the next thing she knew, Makoto had 
slumped into her arms--mysteriously injured. She couldn’t avert her eyes from it. The blood, 
the chaotic atmosphere and, especially, Rei and Minako’s questioning gazes. There was one 
thing that she remembered quite vividly though. At some point, she had snapped and demanded 
that Rei tell her what had happened. She needed to hear the truth, but her friend had turned 
away; the fear and hysterical madness that she felt inside threatened to break her—so she 
persisted until the Martian finally relented to her pleas.</p><p>“<i>Why won’t you tell me 
anything?! Please Rei, I have to know! Who did this...?”</i></p><p>“<i>Ami… You did 
this…”</i></p><p>Ami nearly jumped out of her seat when a hand softly touched her shoulder. 
She was surprised to see a pair of sympathetic, blue eyes staring back at her.</p><p>“Hey, 
she’ll be all right.” Minako smiled reassuringly. “Makoto’s strong. I know she’ll pull 
through! Right, Rei?”</p><p>But the other woman remained silent. There were too many issues 
rushing through her mind at that moment.</p><p><i>That place...Why did it just suddenly 
react like that? How could it just appear from out of nowhere? </i>The shock of returning to 
see her friends being engulfed by dirt and fire still lingered. Even now, the faint odour of 
smoke from their singed garments still hung in the air. It was exactly that type of 
helplessness that made Rei’s stomach churn painfully.</p><p><i>When I</i> <i>disabled the 
field, was that when everything went wrong?</i> <i>It is my fault? </i></p><p>It took 
everything she had to beat down the urge to kick the nearby bed-table. She had told Ami 
countless of times that it wasn’t her fault that this happened, but who did that leave? Who 
else was there to blame?</p><p>Rei’s thoughts fell back to Makoto’s people when she had 
carried the injured ruler in.</p><p>“<i>What--”</i></p><p>“<i>This is no time for questions! 
Get her some treatment!”</i></p><p>“<i>Call the head doctor! Tell him it’s an emergency, top 
priority!”</i></p><p>Would they blame her?</p><p>“Yeah...” Rei mumbled when she noticed that 
Minako and Ami were watching her. “It’s just like Minako said. Makoto is a strong person. 
You should know that better than anyone else, Ami. Besides… her regenerative powers have 
likely kicked in by now. That’s one of the advantages of being a Goddess.”</p><p>“But, even 
still…” Ami weakly protested. This made Rei lose her patience.</p><p>“But nothing! Would you 
just stop worrying like that already? I told you, it’s not your fault! Makoto will be fine 
before you know it.”</p><p>“Are you sure about that?” Both Rei and Minako felt their hearts’ 
skip a beat. “Not all of her injuries will heal...”</p><p>“W-What are you talking about?” 
Rei nervously asked. “You aren’t actually serious are you?”</p><p>Mercury’s hands fumbled 
nervously in her lap under the intense stares of two her friends. She strongly disliked 
being the messenger of bad news.</p><p>“Rei...you know I would never joke about something 
like this.” She momentarily closed her eyes before re-opening them again— only to reveal all 
of her visible shakiness gone and replaced with a degree of seriousness that 
<i>commanded</i> the attention of her audience.</p><p>“Even if you choose not to believe it, 
there <i>are</i> wounds that even a Goddess cannot heal from. Ones such as these--” Ami 
carefully moved the clothing that hid the marks on Makoto’s arms, prompting Minako to 
gasp.</p><p><i>It is just me or did the marks bigger? </i>The blonde asked herself. <i>That 
looks so painful! </i></p><p>“Nothing can heal them? Are you sure about that?”</p><p>“As far 
as I know of, no.”</p><p>“The force field.” Rei said bluntly. Her amethyst eyes were almost 
glowering at an unseen opponent as she said this. Minako had never seen Rei this upset 
before. “Makoto mentioned something about it when we entered the area. Those are the same 
marks… She got them from that power didn’t she?”</p><p>“Yes, I believe so.” Ami averted her 
gaze to gently trace her fingers along a particularly long, jagged, purple marking. It broke 
her heart to see her friend like this.</p><p>Watching the ruler quietly struggle with her 
pain tugged at Minako’s heart. Although they were different people, she believed that, on 
some level, she could feel Ami’s pain. It was like her emotions were overflowing into the 
room, a tide that swelled dangerously upward, ready to drown everyone in the vicinity, and 
yet it also radiated an unspoken gentleness. The erratic sensations were quickly soothed as 
soon as they began to slip out of control.</p><p>Rei, on the other hand, was preoccupied as 
she felt the earlier guilt seize her once more. She never had someone that important to her, 
someone that she cared more than anything, like Ami, but she strangely felt like she could 
sympathize. They were friends after all. Why wouldn’t she feel upset too?</p><p>“Ami…” Rei 
reached within herself to say something to comfort the woman, but instead she bit her bottom 
lip when she drew up a blank. What could she say that would make the situation 
better?</p><p><i>I’m not good at this…</i> She inwardly cursed. All she could do was watch 
Minako walk up to the shorter woman and gave her a comforting hug. Ami received the gesture 
well, and thanked her gratefully for the human kindness.</p><p>Again Rei opened her mouth, 
but again nothing came out. Her patience was slipping fast.</p><p><i>Why is this so hard? 
All I have to do is say something! I--</i></p><p><b>Bleep! Bleep! Bleep!</b></p><p>“Tch, 
what is it now?” Rei dug into her clothing pockets for the annoying sound. When her hand 
reappeared, a small wristwatch-like communicator dangled loosely from her grasp. Its screen 
continued to bleep with impatient urgency, demanding attention from its owner (much to Rei’s 
annoyance). The Martian only had to glance down at the flashing screen to see the 
address.</p><p><i>It’s from Zen? What in the name of Mars could it be now?</i></p><p>“I’m 
sorry, but it looks like something just came up. I’ll be right back.” Rei excused herself 
and left before Ami or Minako could say anything (it wasn’t like she was much help 
anyway).</p><p>The woman didn’t have to walk far to find a vacant room. The staff had their 
hands full as it was, so they weren’t likely going to drop by for a coffee break soon. But 
for precaution sake, Rei quickly did a detection scan. Only once she was confident that she 
wouldn’t be disturbed, she flipped open the communicator’s top and allowed access for the 
communication channel.</p><p><b>Bleep… bleep…</b></p><p><b>Bleep… </b><i><b>private two-way 
transmission secured</b></i><b>… -Conversation start-</b></p><p>Rei had been waiting ready 
to berate the man for interrupting her during this time of urgency, but as soon as his image 
appeared over the projector she knew this was more than a mere check-up call. Zen’s dark 
eyes were anxious and he was clearly agitated about something.</p><p>“Sir! Oh, there you 
are! Thank Goddess I found you. Where are you?!” He demanded.</p><p>“Where am I?” Rei 
repeated his question. “On Jupiter, where else did I say I was going? Don’t you ever listen 
to me anymore?”</p><p>“On Jupiter?! Then have you heard about it? You MUST have, you’re so 
close by!”</p><p>“Hm?” <i>Hear about what?</i></p><p>“You haven’t?” Zen cried incredulously. 
He appeared to be reeling over this news.</p><p>“Enough of these games already, heard about 
what?” She snapped.</p><p>“It’s Uranus. It’s Uranus and Neptune! The leaders of Uranus and 
Neptune have gone missing! No one knows where they are!”</p><p>Rei’s blood ran 
cold.<br><i><br></i><i>“Periods at a time, Gods would go missing. Two planet rulers at a 
time, yet only one would return to the circle.”</i></p><p><i>No…</i></p><p>“No one knows 
where they have gone! Even as we speak, Uranus is now on the brink of civil war! They could 
break out into fighting any day now!”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“Commander!”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“Sir, 
what are your orders?!” Zen demanded anxiously. In the background several more hurried 
noises could be heard—people were scrambling about trying to scrounge updated news on their 
rival, Uranus. He obviously had his hands full at headquarters.</p><p>“They’re on the brink 
of a civil war huh…?” Rei whispered under her breath. She never imagined for the situation 
to become this serious.</p><p><i>Those fools…</i></p><p>Zen fell silent and allowed his 
superior to think the situation through. There was so much riding on this decision. Out of 
all the opportunities they had in the past, this was the one, greatest, chance Mars had to 
finally topple their rival over for good. He knew it, and so did the entire Martian 
Military. The Outer Alliance would undoubtedly collapse with the fall of Uranus especially 
now that both of their leaders were missing.</p><p>However, there was just one thing that 
made this plan imperfect. It was a slim chance, but if Uranus’s ruler were to return and 
rally the forces during the invasion Mars would be placed at a disadvantage. They needed a 
leader, a powerful leader. And as he watched Rei deliberate her decision, he wasn’t sure if 
she was up to the task. It was true that the woman had been chosen by Ares to become his 
heir. It was also true, that she had climbed the ranks through her own determination and 
power. However, there were certain advantages to being a God that a human simply did not 
have. Time, great power and regenerative abilities...</p><p>That was when a thought came to 
mind, but the man hesitated to voice his opinion. How would the Commander take to his 
suggestion? Would she become angry? For what he was about to suggest was in actuality, 
treason-- a charge that was punishable by death. There was little doubt in his mind that his 
idol, Ares, the God of War, would have put him to death right then and there if he knew. But 
Ares wasn’t here.</p><p>“Sir, if I may have a moment of your time.” He requested. “There is 
something that I would like to discuss with you.”</p><p>“What is it, Zen? Can’t you see that 
I’m thinking?” Rei seriously hoped this wasn’t going to be another ‘what Ares would do’ 
ramble.</p><p>“Umm... Well, there’s been something on my mind ever since you departed for 
Mercury. Being a leader is pretty hard work, isn’t it...?”</p><p>Rei slowly turned around at 
this.</p><p>“There’s so many things that you have to keep track of. Not only do you need to 
worry about troop morale, but you have to make sure that everyone follows the schedule, make 
sure that the new recruits get their equipment and dorm assignments, start the training 
lessons, <i>and</i> find the time to hone your own skills as well. It’s almost insane!” The 
man nervously laughed. “Honestly, I... never really gave it much thought until I had to step 
into the role myself.”</p><p>Rei heard the noise in the background fade away as the man 
moved into an isolated part of the palace.</p><p>“Zen...? Is everything all 
right?”</p><p>“It’s... I really don’t know,” he finally admitted. “The moment you left Mars, 
and left me in charge, everyone followed my orders without fail. But I could tell... Even 
though they listened to me, they didn’t have the same respect for me as they do for you. 
It’s like I’m struggling with what little responsibility I have, but it’s nothing compared 
to what you have to deal with! Since Ares left, you took over for both the military and the 
planet relations control. But you didn’t just stop there. You continued to build on the old 
system, and brought about a better way of life for the normal folk, those people who aren’t 
involved in the military. Considering all of that, I...I was wondering if you would consider 
taking over as leader... permanently.”</p><p><i>What?!</i> His Commander’s eyes widened in 
shock.</p><p>“Zen... do you realize what you’re saying? That sort of talk...”</p><p>“Can be 
considered as treason? Yes, I understand that. But please, hear me out! I know I’ve always 
praised Ares. I’ve admired him ever since I was a small boy, and in a way, I still do. He 
was strong and amazingly powerful.” The man paused. “But... what good does that do when he’s 
never around? He disappeared on us without a word! If he still hasn’t returned to us in our 
time of need, then he never will!”</p><p>“Zen.”</p><p>“We need a leader.” He pushed on. “You 
can be that for us. You can become a Goddess just like the current ruler of Uranus! If you 
attempt the rite of-”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Zen felt like he had been winded. “No?”</p><p>“That 
is correct. I refuse.” Rei repeated more firmly.</p><p><i>You aren’t going to abandon us as 
well, are you? </i>Zen fearfully thought. At this rate, it would be 
inevitable.</p><p>“But--But why not?! You’re more than qualified! Most of us, if not all of 
us already see you as our true leader now! But the way you are now, you’re going to keep 
on... aging. You’re going to grow old someday. But if you became a Goddess, you’ll be 
granted eternal youth. You’ll also be able to live forever!”</p><p>“I am quite aware of 
that.” In truth, she understood the predicament better than her subordinate did. “I’m sure 
the entire solar system is aware that a human can become a God if they inherit a planet’s 
throne, that they would gain God-like powers and immortality. Many would indeed seize the 
chance if the opportunity was made available.”</p><p>Rei’s amethyst eyes now held a strange 
light to them as she said this; suddenly even her own voice sounded foreign to her. Hidden 
behind her commanding tone underlay another that was kept hidden from her subordinate. What 
was it? Rei knew, and she was disgusted by it.</p><p>Want.</p><p>Thinking back to her 
childhood days and their lives, how different hers and Haruka’s were, how different Haruka 
used to be, and how she had changed…</p><p>A quiet voice in her head asked: <i>If I had such 
a title, such powers, would the others...?</i></p><p><i>No, I can’t.</i> She resolved. She 
steeled herself against the temptations that lay so close within her grasp, so close that 
she could almost reach out and taste it. Because in truth, it was just a flimsy illusion and 
she knew it.</p><p>“This isn’t about the power. What you are concerned about is the aspect 
of eternal life.” Rei directly looked him in the eye. She wouldn’t deny her feelings, but 
there was something much more important than that.</p><p><i>These battles against Gods and 
Goddesses… I won’t become one and be forced to fight against my friends! Just like poor Ami 
and Makoto…</i></p><p>“In response, I would have to ask you this: since when did a Martian 
need such a thing?” She saw the man’s resolve waver. “Death has long been built into the 
Martian Military code. We are a planet of war! We risk our lives almost daily. Death is not 
uncommon to us, but rather it walks alongside us. If we die, then we die with honour. 
Immortality is merely something that existed long before our birth, and because every planet 
has it, it is not the deciding factor in war. It is the people.”</p><p>Despite the envy she 
felt for her friends, she still possessed a strong sense of pride.</p><p>“That’s why...I 
will continue to fight with the power that I have. If it turns out it isn’t enough, then 
I’ll train harder. I’ll make it <i>be</i> enough. As for growing old... well, there’s just 
no helping for it. It’ll happen someday, but I have no intention of dying before 
then.”</p><p><i>Commander...</i></p><p>“So, that’s your final 
decision...?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>“As for your earlier outburst, officer, you 
understand that you may be tried for treason, correct?”</p><p>“Yes. But if I may say so, I 
don’t regret it.” Rei arched an eyebrow. “I know it may sound strange to hear one of Mars’ 
elite soldiers say this, but... I did, what I felt was right on behalf of the people. And 
although I’ve failed my final test, I would still like to thank you for the opportunity and 
the guidance you have provided me over these last few years. I will immediately turn myself 
in and have the appropriate officer take my place as acting leader until your 
return.”</p><p>“There’s no need.”</p><p>The man blinked up, looking very confused. 
“I...Umm...what? I-I apologize. I’m afraid I must have heard wrong. Could you please repeat 
what you just said?”</p><p>“I said there’s no need,” she repeated slowly. “Please continue 
your duties as if nothing has happened until I return.”</p><p>“But why...? Under Martian 
Military code, the act of treason may be punishable by death!”</p><p>His superior looked at 
him with mild annoyance. “‘May’ be, doesn’t necessarily mean ‘will’ be.” She corrected him. 
Yes, she knew the code by heart. “It seems to me that it would be a greater waste to lose a 
soldier of your calibre for simply voicing his opinion. But I assure you that you will be 
punished. You can expect a doubling up in cleaning duty once I relieve you from your 
post.”</p><p><i>Sir Rei...</i></p><p>Though he was once a great supporter of Ares, Zen felt 
all shreds of lingering loyalty to the past warrior being overcome by a greater admiration 
for his current superior. If he thought he was loyal to Rei before, what he felt now put his 
past devotion to shame. Unquestionably, beyond all doubt, this was the leader that he would 
always follow.</p><p>“Zen!” Rei commanded the man.</p><p>“Yes, your orders Sir?!” He stood 
at full attention.</p><p>“Gather every available soldier! Have them board all available 
military shuttles immediately with enough supplies to last them for 
awhile.”</p><p>“Sir?”</p><p>“We’re invading Uranus!” She ordered.</p><p>“I understand! I 
will carry out your wishes to the best of my ability!”</p><p>With that, the communication 
line was disconnected and Zen’s projection image disappeared. On Mars the man was about to 
redirect his attention to carrying out his superior’s orders when Nozomi ‘happened to walk 
by’.</p><p>“Sounds like a plan to me.” She grinned knowingly.</p><p>“You think so?” Zen 
humoured the girl. “Too bad you aren’t going.”</p><p>“What? Of course I’m going!” Nozomi 
protested. “You don’t think I’m going to hang around here and sit on my butt all day, do 
you?”</p><p>“Oh?” The man feigned interest over his back. He feverishly began typing in his 
code-number for system access.</p><p><b>Bleep, tak-tak-tak-tak, taka, 
bleep.</b></p><p>–<b>Confirmed- </b><i><b>Transport phase A 
initiated</b></i><b>.</b></p><p>“Are you trying to say… that you want to prove yourself?” He 
finished.</p><p>“Let me put it this way. I won’t need the entire five years,” Nozomi smirked 
back.</p><p>Back on Jupiter, Rei waited until her communications port had closed entirely. 
After a few seconds following Zen’s dismissal, her communicator finally gave the clear 
signal and promptly returned to its dormant state.</p><p>“You really… have a bad habit of 
eavesdropping,” Rei remarked as she stuffed her communicator back into her 
clothing.</p><p>Taking the hint, Minako revealed herself from behind the hallway 
corner.</p><p>“Haha, sorry about that Rei... I really didn’t mean to but let’s just say my 
timing sucks.” The blonde made a goofy facial expression as she touched the back of her 
head. “I actually came to tell you that Makoto’s regained consciousness. She was looking for 
you.”</p><p>“She was? All right, then we should be heading back. There’s no time to lose-- I 
have something very important to tell her and Ami.”</p><p>“Yes, Oh Great leader.” Minako 
giggled and saluted as Rei walked by her.</p><p>“Cut that out.”</p><p>“Yes 
ma’am.”</p><p>“That’s SIR to you.”</p><p>“And that’s Mina to you!”</p><p>In front of the 
giggling Venusian, Rei rolled her eyes and wondered how she’ll ever be able to conquer a 
planet and handle Minako all at once.</p><p><u>(Infirmary)</u></p><p>When Rei walked into 
the depressing room again, she found an alert Makoto carefully studying her. It looked like 
whatever she was going to say wouldn’t surprise the ruler that much after all.</p><p>“You’re 
awake.” Rei stated calmly, though her eyes momentarily softened at the sight of her friend 
being alive and well.</p><p>“Yup. I heal fast.”</p><p>There was an awkward 
silence.</p><p>“So, let’s hear it Rei. What’s the news?” Jupiter got right to the point. 
That was Makoto for you.</p><p>When the woman’s body movements betrayed a small hint of 
confusion, Makoto gave a weak chuckle.</p><p>“You really think you can hide something from 
your friends? From what I’ve heard from Ami, that was a pretty long call... and I could feel 
your aura blaze up even while I was asleep. Something’s wrong, right? And it’s not about 
me.” Her eyes stared back in confidence.</p><p>Minako glanced quickly between the three 
friends’ faces. Ami had resumed her calm, composed pose, while Makoto and Rei were now 
staring each other down.</p><p>“You could say that.” Rei finally broke the silence. “To be 
more exact, WE have a problem.”</p><p>“Let’s hear it.”</p><p>It didn’t take more than ten 
minutes to brief Ami and Makoto about Uranus and Neptune: About the missing leaders, how 
Uranus was in a state of disarray, and her plans to conquer the planet of wind. The entire 
time the two other leaders listened patiently in silence, waiting and analyzing the 
situation within their own minds. It wasn’t a matter of getting into an argument now- it was 
the last thing they all needed. Now that long forgotten events have been set into motion 
once more, it was imperative that they try to understand each other and work together or 
‘accidents’ like the one shortly before may reoccur.</p><p>No one spoke until Rei had said 
her bit. But even before the Martian leader finished expressing her intentions, Ami and 
Makoto already knew what their responses would be.</p><p>“It sounds like a plan to me.” 
Makoto nodded approvingly. “We’re in.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” Rei questioned. “But Makoto, 
your planet is still has its neutral planet status. If you choose to go in with Mars, you’ll 
be seen as siding with us ‘barbarians’. Do you think your people would accept something like 
that?”</p><p>“I have faith that my people will follow me, regardless of what I choose.” The 
green eyed woman voiced. “Besides, I think it’s about time that these false alliances are 
put aside—The Inner Alliance, Mercury and Mars, the Outer Alliance, Uranus and Neptune, and 
these so-called neutral planets, Venus, and Jupiter included—what we’re up against is 
putting a lot at stake. Unless we’re all in this together I don’t think we stand much of a 
chance. We have to find Haruka and Michiru!”</p><p><i><b>Twitch</b></i></p><p>“I’m sure 
they’re fine wherever they are.” Rei immediately scoffed. Although she really did feel worry 
for the two women, she couldn’t help but feel resentment whenever Neptune was 
mentioned.</p><p>“Reeeeeei!” Minako warned in a low voice.</p><p><b>WHACK!</b></p><p>“Ow!” 
She automatically felt for where she had been hit on her head. “What was that for? Stop 
hitting me already!” She growled.</p><p>“Sure, when you stop talking like that! Admit it, 
you’re worried about them.”</p><p>“Why should I be worried? I’m only trying to conquer a 
planet right now.”</p><p>“Was that…sarcasm?” Minako stared back at the woman.</p><p>“No. 
Not. At. All.”</p><p>The two women glowered in each others’ faces until someone’s patience 
slipped, and triggered yet another heated argument.</p><p>“Oh man…When they fight, they 
really go at it, huh?” Makoto whispered to Ami. She cringed when Rei challenged Minako on 
the basis of the woman’s fashion sense.</p><p>“It appears so. Yet, can’t you see it 
Makoto?”</p><p>“Hm?” The chestnut haired woman blinked. It didn’t take her long to realize 
what Ami was getting at. “Yeah, I know what you mean. She’s finally... opening 
up.”</p><p>“Oh forget it! I’m going to go start the preparations. Makoto, I’m leaving! And 
you better not overdo it!” Rei shouted over her shoulder as she left the room.</p><p>“All 
right...” Jupiter chuckled and politely waved back. She winced slightly when her arm began 
to throb again, gaining Ami’s attention. Her partner began to change the bandages around the 
wounds.</p><p>“I don’t know about this. Maybe you should just stay here…” Ami voiced her 
concern.</p><p>“No! I-I’m all right. Really!” Makoto shook her head and assured the woman. 
“They might look painful, but I can deal with it.” <i>Hopefully…</i></p><p>Minako was about 
to follow after Rei when Ami stopped her.</p><p>“Minako?”</p><p>“Oh. Umm...I was just going 
to go to my room! Did you need something?”</p><p>“You were also hit by the force field. 
Since you’re already here, perhaps it would be best if I tended to your wounds as 
well.”</p><p>“Huh?” <i>Wounds...?</i> “A-Actually, I already took care of them! I umm... I 
knew some first aid from back at home. I’m fine! Like Makoto said! They only erm… look 
painful.” Minako wildly gestured. “Umm… I’ll see you guys later!” She took off.</p><p>Once 
the blonde had run a ways down the corridor and was out of sight, she breathed a sigh of 
relief. When she lifted the sleeves of her shirt and checked her arms where she had made 
contact with the shield there was nothing there.</p><p>There were no wounds.</p><p><u>(Later 
on a shuttle, on route to Uranus)</u></p><p>Everyone was gathered around a small strategist 
table within the ship’s ‘navigation’ room. On the table, a large map depicting the island 
surface of Uranus’s capital city, Caelus, had been spread out. It had contours lines marking 
the elevations of the buildings and the rough distances between them. Thick, red arrows had 
also been drawn where the initial plan of pursuit would begin. Overall, it would be the very 
same pincer strike that Rei had thrown up against the Uranian army during their last 
encounter.</p><p>At the head of the table, Rei gathered herself up for the briefing summary 
amongst the familiar faces. Ami, Minako, Makoto, Zen and Nozomi (who had caught up to them 
since their departure) were all seated around the table.</p><p>“All right, so this is the 
run-down. I will not repeat myself again, so everyone better listen up.” Rei began. Seeing 
the understanding in everyone’s eyes, she continued.</p><p>“Mars will be supported by 
Jupiter’s troops once we’ve landed. We have concluded from Ami’s data that Mercury is simply 
too far away to provide soldiers for this operation, so instead, they will take over 
communications and Ami will act as our main tactician. If anything should change in the 
situation, we’ll be relying on them to inform us of it.”</p><p>Rei gestured to the overhead 
monitor and pictures of Uranus from Mercury’s database flipped up.</p><p>“Currently, as the 
situation on Uranus stands, there are two major groups struggling for power. Because of this 
struggle, Uranus is on the brink of a civil war. Now, what is our objective? To act as the 
buffer and take control! Jupiter and Mars’ troops are to position themselves between the two 
factions marked at these points, and prevent any violent breakout until the dispute is 
‘settled’. This means until we have ‘drawn’ Uranus into the Inner Alliance. As for the 
others, Zen and Nozomi will be leading Mars’ Medic unit and hide along these main 
streets—they will not engage with the people unless it is absolutely necessary.” She looked 
to her first officer and Nozomi. “We need you to be our trump card is something goes wrong. 
Is that clear?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You got it!”</p><p>“Also, don’t forget that your unit 
will work alongside with Jupiter’s Shadow unit. Try not to clump up in one area-- make sure 
that you’re all spread out for any type of situation, anywhere. As for the rest of the 
divisions, we’ve paired up the strongest levelled classes from Mars with the weakest 
levelled in Jupiter. This is to balance out any potential weaknesses between the parties. I 
assume that this won’t be a problem, Makoto?”</p><p>“Not that I know of,” The ruler shook 
her head. “I think they can handle it.”</p><p>“My calculations also agree with this,” Ami 
added.</p><p>The genius tapped on a few buttons from her miniature computer and brought up 
the divisions onto several, smaller, overhead screens. Each group had a general evaluation 
of skills and the occupations of each of its members. From what everyone in the room could 
see, the groups were fairly balanced out with a few exceptions that made a group more 
specialized for certain missions than others.</p><p>“Wow, that’s so cool!” Nozomi exclaimed. 
“Which one am I in? Oh, wait, I think I see it now!”</p><p>“Nozomi, please try to keep it 
down.” Zen advised.</p><p>“Mm… Oh, all right.” The girl crossed her arms and sunk into her 
seat, silently sulking.</p><p>Minako on the other hand was too busy being impressed to be 
annoying at that point. Everything was so well thought out.</p><p><i>Oh wow, they have 
everything! The soldiers, their evaluations, skills, and occupations… I’m still amazed that 
they drew up a strategy on such a short notice! But that’s beside the point. I still can’t 
believe that they really intend to conquer a planet! Nozomi is right! This is so 
cool!</i></p><p>“And last but not least,” Rei reminded them, “If there is a disruption, do 
whatever it takes to quell the threat, but try to keep the casualties to a 
minimum.”</p><p>“Right!” Everyone nodded.</p><p><b>Bleep! Bleep! Bleep!</b></p><p>There was 
an awkward pause when the ship’s overhead lights began to flash red. Shortly later, a voice 
over the intercom boomed,</p><p>“Attention! Attention! We are approaching the planet 
Uranus’s outer limits! We have also detected an incoming transmission from Uranus. Shall we 
open the channel?”</p><p>Rei leaned forward onto her elbows and pressed the call button to 
the bridge. “Who is it?”</p><p><i>It can only be one of the two factions. If they’ve spotted 
our forces, then they know they’re about to be invaded. The question for them is not how to 
fend us off, but “Who will be the first to curry favour with the dominating 
force?”</i></p><p>Again the voice came over the intercom.</p><p>“Word identifies the sender 
as ‘Baroach’, leader of the ‘true wind clan’.”</p><p><i>Leader of the true wind clan...? 
What an arrogant title.</i></p><p>“What shall you have us do?”</p><p>“Allow the 
transmission.” Ami gave the go ahead. Her blue, computer visor across her eyes lit up as the 
connection was secured.</p><p><b>…</b><i><b>Recording</b></i><b>…</b> She 
read.</p><p><b>…</b><i><b>Channel secured… Opening 
transmission</b></i><b>…</b></p><p><b>Bleep!</b></p><p>The projection of a man in his early 
thirties appeared across the room from where the group sat. His physical appearance was 
bulky, very muscular for a man his age. He had black hair and dark blue eyes eyes-- a rare 
thing for an inhabitant of Uranus. Many of the people were like Haruka, with blonde haired 
and light coloured eyes.</p><p><i>His hair is getting long… </i>Rei noted. <i> It indicates 
laziness to keeping things well kept, perhaps including equipment. His reputation seems dead 
on for his appearance based on what Ami collected.</i></p><p>“This is the leader of Mars 
speaking. State your business.” Rei initiated the conversation.</p><p>“Now, now, please! 
There’s no need to be on guard for someone like myself!” The man on the other end waved to 
the screen in a friendly manner. “My business you ask? I will gladly tell you. I wish to 
request an audience with the leaders of the Inner Alliance to hopefully resolve this matter 
of disorder and put it to rest.”</p><p>“You wish to meet with us?” <i>Does he mean to let us 
walk in without a fight?</i></p><p>“That is correct. The people who support us do not wish 
for violence. All we want to do is talk, and perhaps… negotiate.”</p><p>Now that was more 
like it.</p><p>“Who will we be negotiating with? Yourself, perhaps? Our transmission was 
sent under the impression that you were the leader of the faction ‘The True Wind Clan’. Is 
that correct?”</p><p>“Goddess, no! I’m not the leader. In fact, I’m not even part of that 
clan...anymore, that is. What was sent in the transmission must have been a mistake.” The 
man calmly corrected.</p><p>Both Makoto and Ami raised an eyebrow at this.</p><p><i>I’m not 
getting a good feeling about this guy…</i> Makoto silently thought. Her green eyes were 
swirling with intense concentration. She committed everything about him to 
memory.</p><p>Beside her, Ami was still secretly recording the conversation. She had her own 
suspicions forming within her mind as well.</p><p>“Yeah, then who is?!” It was not Rei, but 
Nozomi who spoke up this time.</p><p>“Oh my... I wasn’t aware that you allowed children into 
your meetings.”</p><p>“Just answer the question.” Rei calmly ordered.</p><p>“Yes, yes, of 
course. I am speaking on behalf of our leader, none other than Uranus 
himself!”</p><p><i>Uranus?!</i> The group simultaneously questioned.</p><p><i>No, he’s not 
talking about Haruka! </i>Rei realized. <i>But </i><i>after Haruka took over, I didn’t think 
he would still be alive! But if it’s true... Actually, this meeting could be beneficial 
after all. Maybe HE would know where Haruka’s gone!</i></p><p>“We accept your offer.” Rei 
finally answered. Heads whipped in her direction, but she ignored it.</p><p>“Excellent! Then 
shall I greet your group in the central plaza of Caelus?”</p><p>“Please 
do.”</p><p><b>…</b><b>Bleep…. </b><i><b>Connection disconnected</b></i><b>…</b></p><p>“He’s 
creepy!” Nozomi declared out once the connection had been cut.</p><p>“Yeah, this time I have 
to agree with her. That guy just got on my nerves.” Zen said thoughtfully beside the younger 
girl.</p><p>“But he seemed nice enough right?” Minako pointed out as she tried to brighten 
the conversation.</p><p>Makoto and Rei’s jaws dropped.</p><p>“How can you say that?!” They 
both exclaimed.</p><p>“Eh? Eh? What did I say? I thought he was nice.”</p><p>“I doubt you 
would be saying that if you knew more about his... background history.” Mercury carefully 
phrased it.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“Never mind,” Rei sighed in exasperation. “Our shuttle is 
already nearing our destination. We should get ready. Minako, you better come with me. I’ll 
fill you in along the way.”</p><p>“Huh? Uhh… well, okay… I guess?” The blonde blinked 
back.</p><p>After the group was dismissed, Zen quickly whispered something into the Martian 
leader’s ear. Rei simply nodded and then shooed him away before she dragged Minako into the 
hall. It was a relatively dark, dimly lit corridor as the pair marched towards the exit. 
Minako certainly felt that way inside as well-- left in the dark. She considered asking Rei 
what that was all about, between her and Zen, but she decided to take the indirect route 
instead. Surely Rei would tell her if it was something important, right?</p><p>“So… what 
exactly am I missing out on?” She asked innocently. Though, the rest of her thoughts, 
however, weren’t quite on the same wavelength. The both of them were close enough that 
Minako could touch Rei if she’d only reach out her hand.</p><p>“To put it simply, the threat 
of a civil war existed amongst Uranus’s people even long before this incident occurred. Ever 
since Haruka officially took over as ruler, the people were split into two factions. A 
smaller group still supported the former ruler of Uranus, while the majority chose Haruka. 
In the end, it was decided that these two groups couldn’t live together, so the group that 
chose the former Uranus voluntarily moved to the land below Caelus.”</p><p>“The land 
below...?”</p><p>“That’s right.” By now Rei had given up on expecting Minako to know 
anything about other planets. It was odd for a diplomat but she shrugged it off. “Most of 
Uranus’s population live on floating islands in the sky. But there’s also a land mass below 
it like that of Earth—and don’t ask me how islands can float. Right now all you need to keep 
in mind that there are two layers of ground on Uranus. Got it?” Minako nodded rapidly. 
“Good. Okay, let’s see… as for living on the bottom ground, many of the people believe that 
only those who have lost their wings would move to such a place. The people who chose to 
move there obviously had a problem with that theory, thus the two groups occasionally 
clashed—Haruka handled it pretty well though. As for Baroach, the man you saw on screen, 
he’s obviously a supporter of the former Uranus. He boasts to be one as you’ve noticed. He’s 
the one we are going to meet.”</p><p>“Umm… okay, I think I got all of that. But... why is he 
a bad guy again? Is it because he lives on the lower ground of Uranus?”</p><p>“ I didn’t say 
he was the bad guy!” Rei huffed. “We just don’t like him-- his political sources say has a 
reputation of being a perverted, ladies man.”</p><p>“…OH.”</p><p><i>Suddenly the phrase 
‘lustful barbarian’ starts ringing in my head, </i>Minako giggled. <i>If only Rei was as 
such…</i></p><p>Before Minako could ask any more questions about this character, the pair 
had reached the exit hatch. As the shuttle doors opened, the area shield was just 
dissipating to reveal Uranus’s capital city below.</p><p>“Huh… I guess they were serious 
after all!” Rei shouted out in the face of the wind. To the side of their door, there were 
other hatches where Makoto and Ami stood out front. The Martian could see Jupiter and 
Mercury nodding back in agreement.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Minako squeaked.</p><p>The wind 
began to die down as the shuttle descended amongst a cloud of shuttles.</p><p>“Let me put it 
this way. A single individual can’t break a planet’s defence system alone. That’s why Makoto 
and Ami were standing out there as well. It would take at least a few of us to break the 
shield if they were serious on keeping us out. But it looks like ‘someone’ else lowered it 
for us…”</p><p><b>SssssssssssssssssssSSSSSSHssssssss….</b></p><p>The metallic structure 
vibrated around the women and clanked noisily as the shuttle touched the ground. They were 
landing on the ground itself. There were no space sports whatsoever on Uranus. In essence, 
the entire floating mass was a spaceport.</p><p>“This is it.” Rei whispered to Minako as the 
cloud dusts began to settle. What Minako was about to see wasn’t anything like she’s seen 
before.</p><p>“Oh wow…” She quietly whispered back in awed. <i>I’ve heard of it but I never 
actually SEEN it…</i></p><p>Beyond the dust clouds were towers that seemed to reach up into 
the sky. They were tall, golden structures that varied in their brownish-gold shadings. 
Other smaller buildings were constructed of engraved stone, their shapes almost resembling a 
set of ruins that had been reconstructed from the rages of time. It was a breathtaking 
mixture; strange markings lay engraved in some, while other had their own peculiarity of 
reflecting the sunlight’s beams. Other smaller contraptions also littered the city; wind 
powered devices that must have created energy for the people. And lastly, one could not miss 
the dome-like barrier that surrounded the outer edges of the islands, acting as guards 
against those who may accidentally wander off.</p><p>It was a desert, it was old, yet at the 
same time it was like an oasis that was brimming with the potential to support life. It was 
no wonder that Uranus’s people took so much pride in their lifestyle of living in the sky. 
Here the air was fresh and clean. Just standing there was enough to make a ‘grounded’ person 
truly feel as if they were soaring.</p><p>“Hey! There you are!” A voice cried out to the 
group. Instantly they recognized the figure—Baroach. “I see you’ve all made it safe and 
sound! That’s wonderful! Erm… hello?”</p><p>But Rei wasn’t paying much attention to the 
figure as much as she was to the surroundings. Perhaps she was lost in memory or perhaps 
there were other thoughts clouding her mind. Whatever it was, the man in front of her was 
clearly being ignored and he knew it.</p><p>“You ARE the leader of Mars, correct?” Baroach 
questioned.</p><p>Rei slowly turned her attention back to the man. “That is correct.” Minako 
noticed the deliberately cold, formal tone that Rei was using. It reminded her of her own 
when she was serious about diplomatic relations.</p><p>“Ah, then you two must be…?” He 
turned to face Makoto, and then to Ami.</p><p>“I am a representative of Jupiter.” Makoto 
said as she tried to remain slightly distant.</p><p><i>Rei should be the one doing the 
talking for now…</i></p><p>Her green eyes glanced overhead, behind their group, to one of 
the tall towers. For one split moment she caught a glimpse of their Medic/Shadow unit. It 
was reassuring to know that their forces were already on the move.<br><i><br></i>“Of 
Mercury…” Ami followed her friend’s lead.</p><p>“And this beautiful young lady?” He inquired 
of Minako. “Perhaps I can escort you--”</p><p>“Oh, I am…”</p><p>“My maid.”</p><p>There was 
an awkward pause.</p><p>Before Rei had realized it, the words had already left her mouth. 
And now, everyone was staring at her in either shock or well shock. Even Minako seemed to be 
at a loss for words. But in the Venusian’s case Rei couldn’t tell whether it was simply 
shock or a reaction of pure horror at the title.</p><p>“Y-Your maid?” Baroach repeated 
uncertainly. The sight of the armor-clad leader of Mars, claiming that this beauty beside 
her was her maid, was—well, he supposed it could be possible, but for a ‘barbarian’ soldier 
to covet such a-- Instead of shooting his mouth he patiently waited for Mar’s 
reply.</p><p><i>Well, no turning back now…</i> “Yes, that’s right.”</p><p>Rei’s arm came up 
and gentle touched Minako’s opposite shoulder. Her hand almost recoiled from the simple 
gesture, but she swallowed against the foreign sensation and forced herself to continue on. 
Her hand eventually slid down and wrapped itself around Minako’s shoulders, drawing the 
other woman up against herself (once again inspiring a wordless speech of shock). Baroach 
was so surprised that he stepped back, especially when he saw the possessive flicker in the 
Commander’s eyes. Minako herself was blushing too profusely to see what Baroach saw, but she 
could feel her heartbeat race all the same.</p><p><i>When has she ever wanted to hug 
me?</i></p><p>“So Mr. Baroach, I strongly suggest that you do not touch any of my property. 
Do I make myself clear?” She finished calmly—but it was anything but calming to the party 
being addressed; to the man, he heard the venomous tone laced underneath that diplomatic 
calm.</p><p>“A-A-Ah, yes! Of course!” He stuttered. “A-And now, we really should be going. 
Can’t keep the meeting waiting aha..ha…” As soon as he turned away from the group his face 
immediately twisted into an expression of indignation and humiliation.</p><p><i>Damn 
it…</i></p><p>The group soon moved to follow the man, but Minako and Rei held back until the 
others were out of hearing distance. Occasionally Makoto or Ami would look back in 
curiosity, but they continued onwards nevertheless. Once they were in the clear Rei finally 
let Minako go (almost in the relieved way). The release in contact was enough to snap Minako 
back into her ‘I am indignant’ mode.</p><p>“What did you do that for? I am NOT your maid you 
know!”</p><p>“You should be grateful.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Visitors from Venus are very 
rare these days, especially out here among the Outer Alliance Planets. If people knew what 
you are, you’d likely be swarmed by anyone who happens to be nearby.”</p><p>“Because…?” 
Minako sweat-dropped. “Ami and Makoto are Goddesses, and I don’t see them being swarmed,” 
She argued back.</p><p>“No, that’s because they said they were only representatives, not THE 
rulers. And secondly, they don’t have a myth about their people hovering over their 
heads.”</p><p>This piqued Minakos’ curiosity. “A myth? Ooooooh, what kind? Is it a good 
one?”</p><p><i>You’re not supposed to be happy about this…</i> Rei inwardly 
sighed.</p><p>“How should I know? I guess that would depend on the person. Some people 
around here think that a Venusian can grant a person their true love-- all because your 
people pride themselves in calling themselves the ‘people of love’.”</p><p>Rei then began to 
walk past Minako to follow the others. “Anyway, forget about that. It’s just a myth. Don’t 
let it go to your head. We’ve got to catch up to the others…”</p><p>“Okay!”</p><p>“And 
Minako?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“While we’re here, you better stay close to me…”</p><p>Minako 
felt her heartbeat skip again. This encouragement brought her the courage to ask,</p><p>“Can 
I… hold your hand then?” She shyly requested.</p><p>“Mm.” Rei outstretched her hand and 
Minako slowly took it. The warmth they felt was different than a one-sided hug or a forced 
hand clasp-- this time, they had both reached out to each other.</p><p>“Let’s 
go.”</p>
