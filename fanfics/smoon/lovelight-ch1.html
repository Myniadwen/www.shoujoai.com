<h1>Love and Lightning (part 1 of 3)</h1>

<pre>Makoto made her way up the stairs, a grim expression on her face. She 
knew she had to see Rei as soon as possible. She quickly walked under 
the gateway and made her way over to the shrine buildings.

&quot;Rei?&quot; Makoto softly called, knocking as gently as she could. A few 
minutes later, Rei slid the outer door open. She looked tired, in her 
T- shirt and shorts, as if she hadn&#39;t slept much the previous evening.

&quot;Makoto?&quot; Rei asked surprised. She blinked up at Makoto owlishly, her 
black hair sticking up in all directions. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;I wanted to talk to you.&quot; Makoto said seriously. &quot;Can I come in?&quot;

&quot;Uh...&quot; Rei blinked a few times, trying to wake up. &quot;Sure, come on 
in.&quot;

Makoto followed Rei in and sat down. After Makoto watched the sleepy 
girl stumble around for a bit, she got back up and made her tea to 
revive her. &quot;Rei, I know you&#39;re seeing Ami.&quot; she said simply.

Rei gaped at her in surprise. &quot;I... how did you know?&quot; Rei asked. 
&#39;Makoto hadn&#39;t gone with them to the bar,&#39; Rei thought confused.

&quot;Minako told me,&quot; Makoto said simply. She stopped for a moment, and 
looked down into her own teacup, suddenly shy. &quot;Ami&#39;s been my friend a 
long time. I consider her family, Rei. And if you hurt her, you&#39;ll 
answer to me. Got it?&quot;

Rei looked at Makoto, and smiled suddenly. &quot;Thank you, Makoto. I&#39;ll do 
my best to be good to her,&quot; she said, resting her hand on the taller 
girl&#39;s. Makoto smiled back at her, got up, and left without saying 
another word.

Rei watched her walk away silently, then softly said &quot;All clear.&quot; A 
sleepy eyed Ami padded out of the bedroom, Rei&#39;s robe loosely wrapped 
around her. Rei seemed to light up as soon as she saw her and took Ami 
into her arms.

&quot;Sorry, Rei,...&quot; Ami started to say only to be shushed by a kiss.

&quot;I&#39;m glad they all care,&quot; Rei said with a smile. &quot;Now, where were we?&quot; 
Rei asked in a teasing tone, and kissed Ami again.

------------------------------------------------------------

Makoto smiled ruefully as she walked down the steps from the shrine 
gate. She was glad that Ami had finally gotten who she wanted, but 
still, she wished she and Ami had been able to work out. Not that it 
hadn&#39;t been fun trying, in retrospect.

Makoto laughed quietly, remembering their dates: the candlelit dinner, 
finger foods, and finally making their way to the bedroom. Makoto had 
leaned over to kiss Ami when... both their communicators went off. And 
away they went on another adventure. They tried to go to a movie 
together a few days later, only to have the theater itself get 
attacked by youma. Then, they went to have a day out together only to 
have Minako show up and tag along. After that, Ami&#39;s mom got the flu 
and she and Ami were both quarantined for a week. Finally, they 
made it into bed, their clothes off and ready. Ami was kissing Makoto, 
and getting ready to move down her body when... both the communicators 
went off. Again.

Makoto got to hear Ami swear for the very first time that day. She did 
it very fluently, and Makoto was surprised Ami knew some of those 
words. They answered the calls, then sat down together on the edge of 
the bed to get dressed.

&quot;This just isn&#39;t going to work, is it?&quot; Ami sighed, as she pulled on 
her pants.

Makoto nodded mournfully in agreement, as she wiggled into her dress. 
&quot;Looks like it. The gods, fate or Murphy&#39;s law seem to be out to get 
us.&quot;

Ami laughs quietly. &quot;Well, you can&#39;t say we didn&#39;t try. Friends?&quot; she 
asked, smiling up at Makoto.

&quot;Friends,&quot; Makoto answered, smiling back.

------------------------------------------------------------

Minako looked around the bar eagerly. &#39;Too bad it&#39;s Bones&#39; night 
off,&#39; Minako thought. She smiled at the more handsome girls as she 
watched them pass. &#39;A few were pretty tempting too,&#39; she thought. 
Minako smiled as she saw the tall girl walk in, making her way through 
the crowd. She waved a bit, and Makoto made her way over.

&quot;How&#39;d it go?&quot; she asked quietly. Makoto smiled a bit mysteriously. 
Minako sighed. &quot;You&#39;re not going to tell me, are you?&quot;

&quot;So is your new heart throb here tonight?&quot; Makoto asked teasingly.

Minako actually blushed a bit, answering &quot;No, darn it.&quot; Makoto laughed 
softly. From the corner of her eye, Minako thought she saw someone she 
knew. She turned to get a better look, and her eyes grew as round as 
saucers. &#39;Of all the bars in the world, did she have to be in this 
one?&#39; Minako thought dazedly.

Sakurada Natsuna was standing at the bar talking with a very familiar 
young woman. With a bit of shock, Minako recognized Ms. Haruna, 
Usagi&#39;s old teacher and Natsuna&#39;s sister. Makoto touched Minako 
lightly on the shoulder. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Makoto asked Minako 
quietly.

Minako pointed them out. &quot;Remember her?&quot; she said softly. &quot;Natsuna&#39;s a 
police officer, and she chased me back when I was Sailor V.&quot;

&quot;Wasn&#39;t she interested in you?&quot; Makoto asked quietly. Minako just 
nodded softly. &quot;Do you want me to keep you out of sight?&quot;

&quot;No, I can&#39;t hide in a corner forever.&quot; Minako said smiling. &quot;See you 
later, Makoto&quot; she finished, as she got up and began to walk over to 
the bar.

Minako made her way nearer, in time to hear Natsuna say &quot;I&#39;m sorry 
about your breakup, but getting drunk won&#39;t help. Let me take you 
home.&quot;

Haruna shook off her younger sister&#39;s grasp and stalked off into the 
crowd. Minako stood there a moment until Natsuna turned and saw her. 
The woman&#39;s jaw dropped, then her face lit up with a smile. &quot;Hello, 
Natsuna,&quot; Minako said shyly.

&quot;Minako,&quot; Natsuna said happily. She moved to hug the younger woman, 
but stopped herself. &quot;How have you been?&quot; she asked with a smile.

&quot;I&#39;m great,&quot; Minako answered. She looked at the brown hared, handsome 
woman and found her smile widening, a slight giggle escaping her lips.

&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; Natsuna asked.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Minako said. &quot;I was just thinking what a fool I was, back in 
my Sailor V days,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;I wish I had let you catch me 
then,&quot; she admitted.

&quot;Is it too late to catch you now?&quot; Natsuna asked with a smile. Minako 
looked at her with surprise.

&quot;Do you still want to?&quot; Minako asked shyly.

Natsuna smiled. &quot;Yes, please. Unless someone has already caught you?&quot; 
she asked.

&#39;Sorry, Bones.&#39; Minako thought. &quot;I&#39;m free as a bird.&quot; she answered 
smiling.

------------------------------------------------------------

Makoto danced with a pretty young lady, smoothly moving her across the 
dance floor. She sweatdropped a bit, noting the crowd of women waiting 
a turn with her. &#39;How did I get myself into this?&#39; Makoto wondered. 
Just then, Haruka cut in and took the young lady, while Michiru 
gracefully settled into Makoto&#39;s arms.

&quot;I never knew you could dance this well, Makoto&quot; Michiru commented 
with a smile. &quot;Sorry about the mob, but once the femmes discover a new 
butch who can dance, well...&quot; she trailed off and shrugged, smiling.

Makoto blushed a bit. &quot;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d call myself butch.&quot; Michiru 
didn&#39;t comment, just smiled mysteriously. Makoto sweatdropped again, 
wondering what that meant.

&quot;May I cut in?&quot; a shy voice asked. Makoto stopped, and turned, only to 
look into Haruna&#39;s pleading gaze. She shrugged at Michiru and took the 
other woman&#39;s hand. &quot;Thank you,&quot; Haruna said in a relieved whisper.

They danced together a while, until Haruna relaxed a bit. Makoto 
looked at her questioningly, and the slightly drunk Haruna giggled a 
bit. She pointed with her little finger to a overweight, T-shirt and 
jeans clad woman who was putting the moves on another girl. &quot;She was 
trying to pick me up, until

I told her I had a date. Then she asked me who, and I looked around 
and saw you. Sorry,&quot; she said again.

Makoto laughed softly, &quot;No problem Rescuing damsels in distress is a 
specialty of mine.&quot;

Haruna laughed, smiling up at Makoto. They sat together at a table and 
talked for much of the evening. Haruna was so obviously out of place 
that it touched something in Makoto. She wanted to protect her, 
somehow. &#39;I&#39;m glad she didn&#39;t recognize me,&#39; Makoto thought with a 
smile. Makoto drank sparingly, but Haruna eventually got blotto, which 
created a new problem: how to get her to her home.

Makoto didn&#39;t trust leaving Haruna to a cabby&#39;s tender mercies, and 
Haruka and Michiru had already left. Which left one option: Makoto 
would have to take her home with her. One mercifully short cab ride 
later, they got to Makoto&#39;s building. Up the elevator to the 
apartment, and Makoto carried Haruna to her bedroom. She flopped the 
woman on the bed, pulled her shoes off, and covered her with a sheet. 
Grabbing one herself, Makoto camped out on the couch. </pre>
