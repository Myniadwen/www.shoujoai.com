<a href="../smoon/sailergg-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>	Michiru closed her office door behind her, exhaled and released her
posture into a more comfortable one. Phased up to her desk, rested two
fingertips against it and smiled. But not a smile of relief, but one of worry.
Her gaze made itself to her phone and she took the receiver and brought it to
her ear, dialled the number home then waited. Each beep that vibrated with her
eardrum made her more uneasy and she focused her eyes on a stain that adorned
the tapestry. When Haruka did not reply she returned the receiver to its
resting, closed her eyes and embraced the picture of her wife. A time passed
before she dialled the number again and also this time there was no reply. After
a trip to the tea machine she returned and directly upon reaching the desk
phoned home once again, held the cup in her hand as two beeps passed and a third
was interrupted by Haruka&#39;s voice. &quot;The Tenoh residence, Haruka speaking.&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s me.&quot; Michiru said and sad down in her comfortable chair. &quot;I spent
most of the meeting being worried about you.&quot; She confessed then sipped from her
cup. &quot;So tell me something that will calm me down.&quot; She leaned forward and
placed the cup on the desk.
	&quot;I found what was wrong with the car, a broken hose.&quot; Michiru could hear
Haruka sit down. &quot;The good news is that I can&#39;t fix it by myself.&quot; A chiming,
steady and teasing laughter. &quot;I was taking a nap.&quot;
	&quot;Good.&quot; Michiru said enjoying the voice of her loved one. &quot;And I woke
you, sorry.&quot; She inhaled. &quot;Let me make it up to you.&quot; She brought forth that
softness in her voice that she used when she wanted things her way. &quot;I&#39;ll go
shopping, come home early and make you something tasty?&quot;
	&quot;Sounds interesting.&quot; Haruka replied hiding the true extent of her
interest. &quot;Gives me something to look forward to.&quot; She rose making some noise.
&quot;I need to pee. Then I will try to rest some more.&quot;
	Michiru heard her wife&#39;s voice die and smiled while shaking her head.

Chapter 3: Amorous shopping.

	The store had a few people trickling through it and Michiru followed the
flow with a shopping basket in her left hand. First was the rice, Haruka loved
the imported jasmine. Its ability to absorb many tastes and the texture a little
rough but still as complex as any other rice. Then was the onions; A young leek
with a bulb almost transparent with a surface so soft a finger touch was but a
embrace. Then was the two oval shallots with skin a colour between red and brown
with the top and bottom edges a sunshine yellow. Fresh garlic with a strong
odour that attracts the buyer from a distance. Then was the herbs. European
rosemary, Haruka&#39;s favourite, she had told Michiru it reminded her of them. They
had never reached any deper then that with the details though. Parsley and dill
for the colour, the evergreen in their relationship. That thing they had
together, the fling that had lasted for many years. A fling that became a
marriage, a marriage that grew to involve a unborn babe and soon a born babe.
She held a bundle of dill a moment smelling it from a distance, smiled, blushed
then added it to the basket. Michiru felt really bad about making a distance to
her longing for Haruka&#39;s body, making her wife think that she was unfaithful. A
dinner like this would probably only increase the suspicions. But there was no
other woman. There was only a woman leaving her pregnant wife alone at home then
spent her entire day feeling bad about it. She was a bad spouse, it was just
that simple.
	Meat. Chicken. Like Haruka, white, soft, moist and spiced with life.
Lamb, like herself, red, tender, captivating and spiced with love. A romance of
meat wrapped in bacon then rubbed with a chilli pepper, sprinkled with cinnamon
and at last painted with yellow olive oil.
	Wine, a sweet imported Chardonnay with the exotic flavours of apricot,
pear and citrus. The liquid inside the bottle a weak yellow containing a amount
of alcohol not harmful to the child inside Haruka&#39;s womb.
	She lingered a moment by the magazine shelf, swept with her gaze over
the covers of luscious women in a range of poses to finally pause at a pregnancy
magazine. Closed her eyes and wished she could be in Haruka&#39;s embrace, then
continued to the counter with a smile on her lips.



	The street was crowded as she walked down towards the subway station
with the plastic bag in the right hand and her purse over the left shoulder.
While the sun graced her face with strong beams of heat her smile still grew.
Her mind was occupied by Haruka, the colour of her regrets was grey but this
would be a first step towards making things better. A quick visit to her boss
and present her case, say that she wanted to be home more with her pregnant
wife. She was not the only one capable of managing the affairs that she was
handling, maybe it was time to let some younger talent step forward.
	The plan was for Michiru to become pregnant next, bring a second child
to their family. With the aid of Kishimo of course. He was a friend of Haruka&#39;s
and had been brought up early in their discussions of a father. Michiru liked
him too; a kind, young and handsome man that worked at the same garage as
Haruka. Together the three had decided that he should be the father of both
Haruka and Michiru&#39;s baby, that way the two kids would be half-siblings and
hopefully share some features. The newborn would have two mothers and one
father, at least until Kishimo found himself a woman.
	She walked down the stairs to the subway station, made her way to the
platform where she once again dived into the depth of thought. It had taken four
months for Haruka to get pregnant, since she and Kishimo where good friends it
had been awkward and when Haruka suddenly became pregnant it was a surprise for
them all and that evening when Kishimo came to visit he looked very relieved.
Sex could kill any friendship and the one between Haruka and Kishimo now had its
shares of scars but was not slowly healing. It was probably Kishimo who would
end up fixing that broken hose in Haruka&#39;s car. Michiru smiled. Her lovely wife
did not stay away from that Mazda very long and tomorrow morning she would
probably be on the phone with Kishimo and ask him to help. But today she rested,
rested and waited for Michiru to come home. She expected to be surprised, to
feel that her words had affected her wife and aroused that flame of shame that
Michiru now felt burning. She loved Haruka, loved whatever shape and contour her
body had. It was fear that had triumphed over her, but not tonight.
