<a href="../smoon/desertroars-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>A/N: ALRIGHT!! THE FINAL CHAPTER BEFORE THE EPILOUGE!!!!!!!!!! And 
Atanihx is &#39;Hinata&#39; backwards with an added x. That&#39;s the Naruto 
crossover part I spoke of.

:: Final Fantasy: End of the Nightmare ::

Ami ran towards the throne room, the blueprint of the palace memorized 
in her mind. She had to get there, inform the Pharoh of the dangers to 
her daughter, and get the backup Makoto and Rei&#39;s past self deserved. 
The blue haired woman approached the throne room and threw open the 
doors.

Only to have several hundred spear points aimed at her chest. 

::::---:::

Pharoh Serenity had seen much in her lifetime. She had seen bloody wars 
and massacres, raids and murders. She had seen her parents slaughtered 
before her very eyes, and was forced to take the crown before her 
fifteenth summer. &quot;My queen,&quot; Came the soft voice of her longtime 
advisor and friend. &quot;This is the woman that I have seen. She does not 
pose a threat to us.&quot;

Serenity turned to Atanihx. The woman was calm and serene, with long, 
violet tinted hair and endless, milky white orbs. But Atanihx was not 
blind. The gift of her bloodline was the gift of the mind eye; the 
violet haired woman could infiltrate an enemy&#39;s mind in a matter of 
moments.

&quot;I see. Guards, back away.&quot; The palace guards looked at one another 
confused, but complied with the woman&#39;s wish nonetheless. They backed 
away and the blue haired woman was allowed to breathe without fear of 
impaling herself.

&quot;Atanihx,&quot; The Mind-Seeker nodded and crouched to the blue haired 
woman&#39;s level.

&quot;Look into my eyes child,&quot; As navy blue met startiling white, the world 
spun. &quot;And let me see your soul...&quot;

Flashes of a strange, new world passed through her mind like water. &#39;Ami 
Mizuno is her name...&#39; Then, there came the image of a bloodsplattered 
night.

The princess and the desert warrior, entwined, surrounded by a sea of 
death.

A genie, hugging her close, whispering sweet nothings.

The desert warrior again, but with fangs and claws, and eyes like a 
demon&#39;s.

&#39;The curse! We need to stop the curse!&#39;

Atanihx resurfaced from the corriders of the Ami Mizuno&#39;s mind. &quot;My 
queen,&quot; she spoke, her words crisp and sharp. &quot;A snake lives within our 
midst.&quot; 

:::---:::

Makoto cursed and blocked Nephrite&#39;s oncoming blow with her forearm 
before retailiating with a sharp thrust of her knee. Her magic was 
seriously running low; transporting Ami and herself into the past was a 
huge toll, and trying to find the source of Usagi&#39;s energy had exhausted 
the last reserves of her magic. Unfortunately, they hadn&#39;t found Usagi 
yet, and now Makoto was basically a mortal now. Rei had disposed of 
Jadeite, and was now in the middle of fighting off Zoisite, who had in 
his possesion petals of the Poison Lotus, whose nectar could liquidate 
anything. And then there was the ever stoic Kunzite, who they knew 
absolutly nothing about.

Makoto always did enjoy challanges.

&quot;You wench!&quot; Nephrite screamed. &quot;I will enjoy making you scream!&quot;

Makoto grinned humorlessly. &quot;Wow, no first date? Just straight to the 
action then?&quot; At Nephrite&#39;s blank look, she sighed and once again took 
up her battle stance. &quot;Never mind.&quot; Nephrite charged and swung widliy, 
blinded by fury and revenge. Makoto easily dodged them, flowing between 
the punches and kicks, becoming like the water. A sharp, mindblowing jab 
of pain sliced across her side made her cry out. She leaped away from 
the brown haired man, holding her side. Nephrite smirked and displayed 
the handheld blade that curved over his knuckles. A trail of ruby red 
trickled down its side. &#39;My blood...&#39;

&quot;You did not think that I would fight you hand to hand did you?&quot; he 
mocked. &quot;I am brave, but not stupid.&quot;

&quot;Could of fooled me!&quot; Makoto snapped. She charged at him again. This 
time, she dropped to the ground and swung her foot out, much like Rei 
did to Jadeitie. As expected, Nephrite jumped over her foot, and aimed 
his blades at her unprotected neck.

&quot;Die!!&quot; he roared. Makoto smirked, then fell to her back. She lifted her 
legs and aimed a kick at the one place she knew would affect him. He let 
out an almost girlish shriek and fell to the floor, his blades forgotten 
as he clutched at his groin. The genie laughed and stood up. She then 
faced Kunzite. The silver haired man lifted an eyebrow at his weeping 
comerade.

&quot;That is certainly not a fighting style I am familiar with.&quot; he 
commented dryly. Makoto cracked her neck and allowed her feet to slide 
apart, fitting into a defensive position while hiding the minor side 
wound.

&quot;It&#39;s called, &#39;Makoto Style&#39;. Learn it.&quot; 

::::-----:::::

Rei yelped as one of Zoisite&#39;s petals nearly touched her cheek. The man 
chuckled and began to throw more of the dangerous blossom at the desert 
girl, faster with each toss. Rei rolled and dived away, but even with 
her slightly inhuman stamina, she was going to tire out sooner or later. 
&#39;Got to end this quickly! But how!?&#39;

--Release me.--

Her violet eyes widened at the whisper of the demon. &#39;Wh-What!?&#39;

--Release me. Now.--

She groaned and held her head. Not now! She really couldn&#39;t afford to 
argue with the demon now!! She grunted and barley dodged another flurry 
of petals.

-- I will only harm those you tell me to.--

&#39;Harm Zoisite and Kunzite then!&#39;

Heat, intense and consuming erupted in her body. The air around her 
began to heat as well, reacting to the violent storm inside of the young 
woman. She gasped and collapsed to the ground, holding her heart as it 
began to beat spastically.

&#39;Wh-what&#39;s happening!?&#39;

--Relax child. Become what you were meant to be.--

Flames swirled around her body, and then, she was fire, all molten heat 
of destruction. Her body was consumed, and merged with the fire until 
there was no &#39;Rei&#39;, there was no demon. There was only the heat, the 
passion, the desire and will to protect. Zoisite backed away, afraid 
that he woud be consumed as well. But with less positive results. The 
flames swirled for a few more minutes, then they receded to reveal the 
new warrior.

&quot;Holy shit...&quot; Makoto gasped.

Rei was no longer clothed in the leather armor of soldiers. Her feet 
were clad in red mocasins which tied up to mid calf by a red silk 
ribbon. Around her waist was a red linen wrap, which made a &#39;V&#39; at her 
waist. Her midriff was bare, displaying the ritual tatoos that had been 
carved into her body. Her breats were covered by a lavender wraparound 
that ended in a small bow at the front. Attatched to the middle of the 
bow, was a heart-shaped ruby, gleaming with magic. The lavender 
wraparound was also supported by red ribbons that were tied at the nape 
of her neck. White fingerless gloves hugged her forearms, ending at the 
elbow where a red ribbon held them in place. Around her head, was a 
golden tiara shaped like a cobra, whose head was resting on Rei&#39;s 
forehead, right above the bridge of her nose. And hanging from it&#39;s 
mouth, was an oval shaped ruby, suspended from a small silver chain.

&quot;Now,&quot; the desert warrior spoke, her voice dripping with malice. &quot;Where 
were we?&quot; Zoisite hesitated, then threw more of the dangerous flower at 
the black haired girl. Rei made no move to dodge them.

&quot;Rei!&quot; Makoto screamed.

As the petals neared the girl, they eurpted into flames a few 
centimeters away from her chest, their ashes drifting to the ground. The 
desert girl lifted an elegant brow.

&quot;Is that the best you can do?&quot; Without waiting for his answer, she 
attacked. The tips of her index finger and middle finger began to glow.

&quot;Burning...&quot; With an elegant twist of her body, she created a circle of 
fire. Ancient runes bean to glow within the circle, each at a 
directional point. North, northeast, 
northwest,south,southeast,southwest, east, and west. She spread her legs 
and placed both of her hands, palms up, in Zoisite&#39;s direction.

&quot;Mandala!&quot; At her command, rings of fire ripped from her palms and sped 
towards the guard. He stared wideeyed at the oncoming attack, surprised 
to no end when the fiery rings merely slashed the pouches that contained 
the flower petals. He looked back to see the petals of the Poison Lotus 
burning away to nothing.

&quot;Do not think I will let you live.&quot;

Zoisite turned to see that Rei had created a bow and arrow, made 
entirley out of flames. Aimed at his heart. Her purple eyes glared at 
him. &quot;Flame...&quot;

&quot;Zoisite!&quot; A larger, more muscular body covered his own. Silver hair 
trailed over his shoulder. Zoisite&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Kunzite!&quot; he gasped.

&quot;Sniper!!&quot; Kunsite screamed as the flaming arrow pierced his back, then 
pierced Zoisite&#39;s chest, the force of the attack sending both men 
sprawling to the floor.

&quot;W-why?&quot; Zoisite coughed, ruby red blood trickling from his lips.

&quot;You are precious to me,&quot; Kunzite whispered. &quot;I could not allow you to 
die alone.&quot; Zoisite smiled, a truly happy one as he closed his eyes. 
&quot;Sentimental fool.&quot; he murmured.

Nephrite wobbled unsteadly to his feet, still weakened by Makoto&#39;s low 
blow. &quot;Kunzite! Zoisite! No!&quot; he screamed. The two men were dead, as was 
Jadeite. &quot;Damn you!&quot; he roared to Rei. The raven haired beauty turned to 
regard the enraged man with cool eyes. She lifted a palm.

&quot;Fire Bird.&quot;

With that, a bird made of fire shot from her palm and shrieked as it 
zoomed towards Nephrite. The brown haired man roared yet again, a cry of 
anger and sorrow, as he aimed his final punch at the fire bird. The bird 
opened its beak and caught the fist, going so fast it pushed Nephrite 
out of the window and into the night sky, where it consumed him in a 
blaze of red.

He didn&#39;t even scream.

Makoto stared at the warrior. She was truly dangerous now that she had 
completely merged with the demon. Now she was going to be unpredictable, 
perhaps become worse than the Cursed One. Rei turned to Makoto.

And bowed. &quot;I have completed the favor I was asked.&quot; she murmured. The 
clothes she had on suddenly dissolved and reformed back into the leather 
armor, leaving Rei to collapse onto the ground. Makoto rushed and 
captured the exhausted woman in her arms. &quot;Rei!&quot; she whispered, shaking 
the unconcious woman in her arms. Rei groaned and her eyes fluttered 
open. &quot;Makoto?&quot; she groaned. Makoto sighed in relief.

&quot;You&#39;re okay.&quot; the genie of the future breathed. The raven haired girl 
forced herself up into a sitting position.

&quot;Yes I&#39;m--&quot;

A shrill scream ripped through the night, blood curdiling and 
heartstopping. Makoto yelped and looked around, a cold sweat coating her 
face. Whoever that scream belonged to--

&quot;Usagi!&quot; Rei yelled as she leaped up and began to run towards the top of 
the palace. Makoto followed. 

:::----::::

Ami ran with Atanihx to the source of the scream. &quot;I have no doubt that 
the scream belongs to the princess!&quot; Atanihx explained breathlessly. Ami 
bit her lip and allowed the advisor to lead them to the top.

&quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be able to stop Endyimon by ourselves!&quot; Ami cried.

&quot;Then you will not be by yourselves.&quot;

Ami and Atanihx stopped and turned to see...

&quot;Minako! Setsuna!&quot; Ami gasped. It was indeed the past selves of the 
blonde and the One of Magicks. Minako looked so much different, childish 
blue eyes replaced with hard sapphires. &quot;I offer my assistance.&quot; the 
blonde said with a small bow of her head. Setsuna joined the advisor and 
the proffeser in their trek to reach the princess. Minako followed 
shortly, and soon, the four women were racing to the top. 

:::::----::::

&quot;Let me go!&quot; Usagi shrieked as Edyimon dragged her to the edge. The 
pharoh said nothing for a while, then whirled on her to clamp his hands 
on her throat, swinging her to dangle over the egde of the perilous 
abyss.

&quot;Want me to let go now?&quot; he taunted. Usagi screamed, though it was 
hoarse. She grabbed Endyimon&#39;s wrist with her hands. &quot;You should have 
never lain with that, that--desert whore!!&quot; he spat out. Usagi&#39;s eyes 
flashed dangerously.

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare call Rei that you snake!&quot; she hissed. Endyimon laughed.

&quot;I will call her however I want!!&quot; he sneered. He smirked and loosened 
his grip on the blonde&#39;s throat, causing her to slip a bit. She bit her 
lips to keep from crying out in fear.

&quot;Get your hands off of her!!!&quot; Rei roared as she drew the scimatar that 
rested at her hip. Holding it over her head, she charged, seeing red as 
that pig dared to touch what was hers. The demon, so close to the 
surface, sprang and Rei was lost in a sea of flames. Endyimon&#39;s eyes 
bugged out of his head as the girl--no, the creature sprang out of the 
fire and leaped toward him with a savage growl. He wasted no time in 
dropping the princess in favor of springing away. He watched in glee as 
the creature dived over the top in order to save her.

&quot;Fools!&quot; he laughed. &quot;You&#39;re both fools!&quot;

&quot;He who calls one fool, is the fool Endyimon.&quot;

Endyimon gasped and whirled around. 

:::::---:::::

Usagi nearly died of fright as she was dropped from Endyimon&#39;s grasp. 
She screamed and closed her eyes, awaiting her fate.

It never came.

Instead, the feel of silky feathers carresed her face, and warmth 
spreaded from her lips to her entire body. Someone was kissing her, 
but--

&quot;Rei?!&quot; she gasped in disbelief. This was the physical embodiment of 
Rei&#39;s demon, she realized. Feathers, the color of flames, covered Rei&#39;s 
entire body, save for her face which was human. Her hands and feet were 
now three toed talons, black in color and dangerously sharp, yet she 
knew that Rei would never cut her with those sharp claws. Large wings 
sprouted from her back, huge in wingspan, almost a large as their 
mistress was tall. Rei smiled and cradled the blonde princess to her 
feathered chest and pulled them up and flapped her wings. They soared in 
the night, Usagi breathless when they reached the peak. Rei&#39;s wings 
flapped to keep them afloat.

&quot;Hold onto me,&quot; the demon girl said, her voice containing a growl that 
made Usagi&#39;s heart flutter. Obediantly, she wrapped her arms around 
Rei&#39;s waist, shivering at the feel of the satin smooth feathers and the 
empty air.

&quot;Endyimon!&quot; The demon girl roared. She raised her palm and soon gathered 
a large ball of heat and energy. &quot;Die!&quot; With that, she puled back her 
arm and flung the energy ball at the pharoh. 

:::---::::

Makoto dived down and pulled Ami underneath her body to sheild her love 
from the intense heat and the horrifiing sounds of Endyimon&#39;s screams. 
She dared a glance and saw Atanihx had long hidden behind a stone 
obelisk, and Minako had drawn the sorceress into her arms behind another 
stone obelisk.

Minutes passed.

When the heat had receded, the women sat up slowly and looked at the 
black scortchmark that marked Endyimon&#39;s final resting place.

More minutes passed; an eternity seemed to tick away.

&quot;It&#39;s over,&quot; Ami whispered. &quot;It&#39;s finally over...the nightmare will 
never come to pass...&quot;

Makoto said nothing, but drew Ami into a breathtaking kiss that lasted 
another eternity.

---That Morning...-----

&quot;By the power of Ra, and with my blessing,&quot; Pharoh Serenity finished 
with a smile. &quot;I bind these two lifeforces together as one; may the gods 
favor you always.&quot;

Usagi, daughter of the Pharoh and princess of the Nile turned to her 
beloved. She was breathtaking, her body wrapped in pure white silk and 
her heart in her smile.

Rei, daughter of the desert sun and princess of demons smiled back, ever 
so gently. Her body was, for once, without armor. Instead, much to 
Usagi&#39;s surprise, she was dressed in the same, pitch black robes she had 
worn when they had met.

&quot;What are you waiting for!?&quot; Makoto yelled with a grin. &quot;Kiss her 
already!&quot;

Rei blushed gently, then placed her hands on Usagi&#39;s waist, drawing her 
in for the kiss that would seal their lives together.

&quot;Ti amer&ograve; per sempre, o mia dea del Sole...&quot; Rei whispered before 
kissing the love of her life, her one and only.

The desert roared with the cheers of the people, all cheering for the 
princess, and her raven haired love.

&quot;Ready to go?&quot; Makoto asked as she held Ami close. Ami nodded, and with 
a swirl of green magic, they dissapeared into the timestream, back to 
the future.

The nightmare, was over.</pre>
