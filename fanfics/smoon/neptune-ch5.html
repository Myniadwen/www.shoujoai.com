<p>The daemon reached the top of the stairs, licking its lips as it  started to slowly creep past the first two rows of bookshelves. It was  about to make its way past the third, when an explosive noise startled  it into backing up. Looking up, it saw what looked like a water spout  shoot up from between the seventh and eighth rows, knocking nearby  science and mathematic books into the air and out into the other aisles  as it reached to the roof.</p>
<p>The daemon looked down at Zultan on the first floor. &quot;Saintu?&quot;</p>
<p>The  witch was just as mystified as her daemon. &quot;Don't ask me,&quot; she said as  she shrugged her shoulders. &quot;Maybe the brat hit some weird sprinkler  system hoping to touch off the alarm. Just get her now before we...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Guided by a new eon,&quot; a voice announced, &quot;Sailor Neptune acts with grace.&quot;</p>
<p>Both  witch and youma turned to see Sailor Neptune standing next to the aisle  of now scattered books, the Senshi standing in a fighting stance.</p>
<p>&quot;Cute,&quot; Zultan smirked. &quot;Daemon, get rid of this clown and find the girl!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Saintu, saintu!&quot; the thing cried as it lunged at the Senshi.</p>
<p>Sailor  Neptune meant to only jump back a foot or two to get out of the youma's  range, but instead she leaped back to the far wall of the library, some  twenty feet back. When she finally landed, she looked almost as shocked  as the daemon. &quot;Pluto never told me about that,&quot; she mumbled to  herself. Looking at the daemon in front of her, she remembered the  words Pluto taught her. She didn't know whether it was instinct or  simply that feeling of deja vu again, but she first raised her hands  above her head, her body becoming a conduit as all the energies of the  ocean's depths traveled through and around her, concentrating itself  into a large blueish-green ball of kinetic energy, a ring circling it  just as one encircled her henshin wand's crescent.</p>
<p>&quot;Deep  Submerge!&quot; she cried out, sending the attack at the daemon. It traveled  from her hands at incredible speed. Unfortunately, the thing was  somehow able to leap out of the attack's way, the ball of energy  instead plowing through three reference computers and the second floor  rest room before blowing a very large circular hole out the second  story east wall.</p>
<p>Neptune raised her hands up once more to attack,  when her opponent landed just a few feet in front of her. The daemon  aimed it's hand at her and three of its long red claws launched out at  her, one missing the Senshi completely while the second and third ended  up in her right shoulder and bicep. As Sailor Neptune shrieked out in  pain, the youma grabbed her by the front collar of her fuku.</p>
<p>&quot;Saintu,  Saintu!&quot; it growled, picking the injured Senshi up and hurling her over  the second story railing towards the first floor below.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>Outside  the library, the sudden explosion on the second floor had the entire  campus in an uproar. Students ignored the prohibitive curfew and ran  out of their dorms even as the nuns tried to round the girls back up  again. Sister Claire ran out of the greenhouse in alarm, the concussive  impact of the explosion having broken several glass panels of the  hexagonal building next to the library. Careful of the fallen glass all  around her, she headed for the library in order to check on the safety  of anyone who might still be in the building.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>Back  in the building, Zultan watched as Sailor Neptune tried to land on her  feet on a table over by the biography section, only to have the table  collapse beneath her with a crash. She frowned, turning away from the  groaning Senshi as she pulled out a large leather sachet. This was more  than she was prepared for. What's worse, there was no way she'd be able  to stay now that her cover had been blown. Opening her pouch, she  realized she'd have to grab the two heart crystals and run while she  still could.</p>
<p>Sailor Neptune struggled uneasily to her feet, tears  running down her cheeks as she painfully pulled out the two nails from  her arm and shoulder. She could see the witch going towards her  classmates while she could hear the youma up above her. Wiping the  tears from her eyes, she grabbed the nearest two books and flung one at  Zultan, hitting the witch's hand and causing her to drop her bag with a  loud curse. She then turned her attention back to the daemon who was  hopping down the stairs. It looked angry, scary, and ready to rip her  apart limb from limb.</p>
<p>It did not, however, look very bright.</p>
<p>&quot;Quick,&quot; Neptune yelled as she tossed it the other book, &quot;catch!&quot;</p>
<p>The daemon caught the book with both hands before it had time to think. &quot;Saintu?&quot;</p>
<p>Sailor  Neptune took advantage of the confusion to raise her arms once more  above her head for her attack. &quot;Deep Submerge!&quot; This time, she struck  the youma full-blast. The thing screamed in pain as it dissolved into a  small statue of St. Rita and struck the floor, a small seed then  popping out of it and crumbling to dust. She turned her attention back  to Zultan, who had run into the librarian's office.</p>
<p>&quot;Damn you!&quot;  the witch shrieked as she locked the door behind her, &quot;This isn't over  between us, Sailor Neptune!&quot; As a large white car with a black  five-pointed star on the driver's side door crashed out through the  wall of the librarian's office and raced off into the night, Neptune  made her way to Miki and Miyuki, their heart crystals both still  levitating in the air above them. She didn't know what the talismans  were supposed to look like, but somehow she knew that these weren't  them. Wiping more tears of pain from her eyes, she knelt down over the  two unconscious girls.</p>
<p>They both looked like they were simply  sleeping, and as she looked at her sempai an idea presented itself.  &quot;Forgive me, onee-sama,&quot; she whispered, &quot;But this may be my only  chance.&quot; She closed her eyes, bent down, and brought her lips to  Miyuki's. The kiss was awkward and one sided, but it was still enough  to make Neptune's heart race faster. Pulling back, she then quickly  returned the heart crystals to their rightful owners. As Miki and  Miyuki slowly began to come around, Neptune looked over at the pouch  Zultan had dropped, and was surprised to see it floating slightly off  the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;Nani?&quot; she asked as she opened it. There was a heart crystal inside it.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello,&quot; a voice from outside the building called, &quot;Is anybody in there?&quot;</p>
<p>Neptune  quickly closed the leather bag and jumped to the second floor, leaping  from the gaping hole as Sister Claire from the greenhouse ran in, the  nun shocked to find two groggy students lying on the floor and the  library itself looking like some sort of wrecking crew had bet set  loose inside it.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>The nun lay in the  hospital room, monitors and tubes sticking in her and displaying her  vitals as the nurse and doctor quietly watched over her. &quot;Dr. Mizuno,  is there anything else I can do?&quot;</p>
<p>The doctor sighed deeply as she  shook her head. &quot;We've tried everything, but it's not enough it would  seem. Her metabolic readings are continuing to spiral downward. She's  not going to make it.&quot;</p>
<p>The nurse nodded in understanding. &quot;A  representative from the convent will be here soon. You look frazzled.  Care for a cup of coffee? My treat.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Mizuno looked over at  the nurse and smiled weakly. &quot;Thanks. You know,&quot; she said as she  followed the nurse out of the room, &quot;I wonder what my Ami-chan would  think if she knew her mom really wasn't Mrs. Super Doctor...&quot;</p>
<p>As  the door to the room shut, the window to Mother Superior Ichi's room  was opened from the outside. Racing from rooftop to rooftop, it had  only taken Sailor Neptune roughly fifteen minutes to arrive at Tokyo  General. Ignoring her own pain, she entered the room. It didn't take a  genius to figure out who the third heart crystal must've belonged to,  and as she took the glowing object out of the bag and walked over to  the nun, Ichi opened her eyes.</p>
<p>The nun didn't have her glasses  on, but she was able to make out the blurry shape of a beautiful young  maiden wearing a crown and holding something shiny. &quot;M... Mother  Mary...&quot; she weakly whispered.</p>
<p>Sailor Neptune returned the  crystal to the principal, waiting until it was safely absorbed back  into her before she exited through the window and headed back to St.  Agatha's. Landing on the roof of her dorm building, she detransformed  and quickly made her way in. The building was strangely quiet, and she  made it into her room and then into the bathroom undetected. Reaching  into the medicine cabinet, she quickly cleaned and bandaged the two  nail wounds. There were black and blue marks all along her side and the  upper thigh of her right leg, but luckily nothing showed thanks to her  school uniform other than the scrape she had sustained to her shin when  she'd first run up the library stairs. Her hands were shaking, and  beads of sweat were forming on her forehead as she exited the bathroom  and entered the room she shared with her roommate.</p>
<p>Noting that  Takayo wasn't in the room, she looked out the dorm room window and saw  everyone outside. She made her way out of the building and saw police  and ambulance trucks parked out on the parking lot.</p>
<p>&quot;Michiru-san?&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru turned to see Sister Claire coming up to her with her sempai Miyuki. The freshman looked down awkwardly, &quot;Onee-sama...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Michiru-chan,  thank goodness you're alright,&quot; Miyuki said as she came over. &quot;It's  alright, Miki hasn't come to just yet, but the doctors say she'll be  okay.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I... I see...&quot; Michiru said, a bit confused. &quot;Tell me, what exactly do you remember?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She  said she went out with you and Miki to investigate the library,&quot; Sister  Claire answered. &quot;She then said the three of you reached the building,  and then she blacked out.&quot; The nun then crossed her arms as she stared  at the violinist. &quot;You realize of course that ignoring such a curfew is  punishable by detention, even expulsion?&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru silently nodded her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Right then,&quot; the nun continued. &quot;Just try not to let it happen again, okay?&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru looked up at the nun in surprise. &quot;You... You're not going to reprimand us?&quot;</p>
<p>The  nun chuckled a bit. &quot;I'm just in charge of the green house,&quot; she said,  &quot;reprimanding would be a job for your teachers. Give me your word you  won't do something like this again, and we'll let it go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry,&quot; Miyuki spoke up, &quot;She does.&quot;</p>
<p>The  nun turned away and headed back over to the greenhouse where a group of  students were already starting to pick up the broken glass. Michiru  turned to her sempai, &quot;Onee-sama, I'm sorry for...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's  alright, Michiru-chan,&quot; Miyuki said as she crossed her arms, &quot;Like  Sister Claire said though, don't go running around after hours like  that again, okay?&quot; Looking closer at the freshman, she noticed  something off in Michiru's eyes. &quot;Michiru-chan, you are alright, aren't  you? Do you need to have a doctor look at you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, really,&quot;  Michiru answered, &quot;I... I'm fine.&quot; She turned before she said or did  anything more embarrassing in front of her sempai. As Miyuki watched  the freshman walk away, she smiled. The girl could be a bit aloof, but  was hardly stuck up as Beniko had said. Maybe she was right for the  role of Joan after all. She certainly was beautiful enough, with her  long wavy hair, deep blue eyes, and those full lips...</p>
<p>Miyuki stopped herself. &quot;Where did <em>that </em>come from?&quot; she muttered before heading back to her dorm room.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>Michiru  managed to make it back to her room right around the same time as her  roommate Takayo. They'd found the librarian Sister Philomena  unconscious but safe in the library basement. And that Sunday, there  was a special mass to celebrate the Virgin Mary's healing of Reverend  Mother Ichi.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, she went about her daily  routine, somehow managing to keep her injuries from being discovered.  She also continued to spend time with Miyuki, the two of them becoming  almost inseparable to the point where Michiru now could feel at ease  around the object of her crush.</p>
<p>During this period, there had  been no further attacks by any daemons. And, while there was an ongoing  official investigation into just what had happened that night in the  library, Michiru's secret seemed safe for the moment. One night, three  and a half weeks after the library incident, Michiru turned the lights  off, said goodnight to Takayo, and went to sleep.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p><em>She  looked down at her unconscious sempai, and bent down to kiss her.  Miyuki woke up and returned the kiss as she wrapped her arms around  Michiru, opening her mouth so that the younger girl could deepen the  kiss. As both girls began to moan, somewhere the sound of a woman's  laughter was heard.</em></p>
<p><em>Michiru looked up with a start. The laughter was neither malicious nor sinister, but mirthful. </em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Your wasting your time dreaming of her, you know.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Michiru was indignant, &quot;Wasting my time?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;She  can cause you to rise, but she'll never cause you to swell. She'll  never be able to reach your depths, never know your soul. The ocean  holds within itself great secrets, but it takes the right person to  unlock them.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Michiru asked angrily,  ignoring the vanishing image of Miyuki as she stood up and defiantly  balled her hands up into fists. &quot;Speak plainly.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;The sea  cannot move a sailboat on its own anymore than it can create a  hurricane or carry its briny salt-scent to the mariner's nostrils under  its own power. No, to do any of those things, you need the <strong>wind</strong>.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;The wind?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Remember me,&quot; the voice said as it started to fade away, &quot;Remember me...&quot;</em></p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>Michiru opened her eyes with a start. &quot;The wind?&quot; she asked. &quot;What did it mean, 'remember me?'&quot;</p>
<p>She  silently got out of bed and pulled out her henshin wand. &quot;Pluto,&quot; she  whispered so that Takayo wouldn't wake up, &quot;If you can hear me, take  this back. I don't know what you did to me, or why, but take it back.&quot;  After a few seconds of nothing happening, she sighed and put the wand  back. Laying back down, she eventually fell back into into a troubled  sleep.</p>
