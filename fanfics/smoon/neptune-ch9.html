<p>“How are you feeling?” Pluto asked as she came over carrying two cups.</p>
<p>Michiru glared angrily at her. “How am I feeling?” she asked incredulously. “Are you serious? How do you <em>think </em>I’m  doing? I have a headache, I got sick in front of my friends, and ever  since meeting you I’ve been having recurring nightmares. Also, I’ve  fought two monsters now alone, and both times I nearly lost. If you’re  my fellow Senshi, why are you never anywhere around to help me?” She  then brought her hand back up to her forehead, wincing at her headache.  “And to top everything else off, I think I’ve fallen into a love  triangle between my sempai and the wind.”</p>
<p>Pluto’s eyes widened suddenly. “The wind?”</p>
<p>Michiru shook her head. “Don’t ask.”</p>
<p>Pluto  nodded, but the intense look in her eyes didn’t fade. “First thing’s  first. Here, take these,” she said, offering one of the two paper cups  she had to Michiru. Inside the cup were two small pills. “It’ll help  with the effects of the daemon.”</p>
<p>Michiru took the two pills and  placed them in her mouth. Taking the second cup, which contained water,  she swallowed them down. “Pluto-sama, why weren’t you there to help me?”</p>
<p>Pluto  sat down next to Michiru on the examination table and drew in a deep  breath as she crossed her legs. “There are certain rules I’m forced to  follow, taboos which I am not allow to break. One of them is that,  under normal circumstances, I’m forbidden to abandon my post at the  Gates of Time.”</p>
<p>Michiru finished off the water. “Then why are you here now?”</p>
<p>Pluto  gazed searchingly into Michiru’s eyes. “You say you’ve been having  recurring nightmares. During your battle with this last daemon you  mentioned both Beryl and Serenity, and you just now made mention of the  wind. Michiru, just how much do you remember?”</p>
<p>Michiru looked confused. “Remember?”</p>
<p>“Describe the recurring dreams to me.”</p>
<p>Michiru smirked. “Maybe it would help if I lay down and you took notes?”</p>
<p>Pluto narrowed her eyes. “This isn’t the time for levity, Michiru-san.”</p>
<p>Michiru  crossed her arms. “Fine. There’s a kingdom in flames, people are dying,  and I’m hurt. There’s someone else, a woman I feel a connection with,  like a sister or best friend.”</p>
<p>“Or lover?” Pluto asked.</p>
<p>Michiru  nodded. “Yes, now that you mention it. She calls me her love, and she  has blonde hair, that I remember. But the nightmare always ends before  I get a look at her.”</p>
<p>“I see… And Serenity and Beryl?”</p>
<p>Michiru  brought both hands up to her head and closed her eyes. “I don’t know,”  she answered with a sigh. “It… It made sense somehow at the time I was  saying it, when I was under the influence of the daemon’s attack, but  now I have no idea why I’d mention those two names.”</p>
<p>Pluto nodded. “You say you’re in a triangle between the wind and your sempai?”</p>
<p>“Hai,  I…” she stopped when she fully realized what she’d just admitted to.  “And before you ask, yes, that would mean I’m attracted to girls. Or is  that not in destiny’s plan?”</p>
<p>“Actually, it is,” Pluto responded with a slight smile.</p>
<p>Michiru gave the Time Senshi a strange look, then looked away again. “You… You’re the first person I came out to.”</p>
<p>“Then history repeats itself again it would seem. Tell me more about the wind,” she said, ignoring the freshman’s confused look.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to explain without coming out sounding crazy.”</p>
<p>“Try me.”</p>
<p>“I  had a dream where a woman’s voice said something about only the wind  could stir my waters. Then, she told me to remember her.” Looking at  Pluto again, she gave her a pleading look. “Pluto-sama, what did you do  to me? What’s happening?”</p>
<p>Pluto looked at the young girl sitting  next to her expressionlessly for a few seconds before getting up from  the examination table and walking over to a chart. “A little over  twelve thousand years ago,” she began as she came back over with the  chart and a thermometer, “There was an ancient solar system wide  kingdom known as the Silver Millennium. Open your mouth,” she said,  sticking the thermometer in the girl’s mouth and looking at her watch  as she continued. “The ruler of this kingdom was Queen Serenity, and  she ruled from her palace on the moon. Those who lived in the Kingdom  of the Moon watched over man’s progress on Earth, and guarded the  sacred stone known as the Silver Crystal. On the dark side of the moon,  however, there was a much smaller kingdom ruled by a tyrant named Queen  Nehelenia. Open,” she said, removing the thermometer from Michiru’s  mouth. “Hmmm, ninety-eight point six. Good,” she said as she wrote the  result down on her chart.</p>
<p>“Roll your sleeve up,” she said as she  wrapped an automated blood pressure gauge around Michiru’s arm. “No one  knew of Queen Nehelenia or the existence of the Dark Moon Kingdom  before the birth of Princess Serenity, when she showed up at the grand  reception and attempted an insurrection. Queen Serenity defeated  Nehelenia, but not before the Queen of the Dark Moon placed a curse  upon the kingdom that the Silver Millennium Kingdom would fall and that  Princess Serenity would never reach the throne.” Pluto released the  blood pressure gauge and wrote the results down.</p>
<p>“A few years  later,” she continued as she placed her fingers on Michiru’s wrist and  checked her watch to get her pulse, “Princess Serenity fell in love  with the Earth’s Prince Endymion. That did not sit well with an Earth  monarch by the name of Beryl, who was in love with Endymion as well.”  She released her wrist, wrote new notes down, and continued. “Beryl was  enraged with jealousy. She made a pact with a dark force from deep  within the sun that called itself Queen Metaria. She then proceeded to  corrupt Prince Endymion’s four guards, the Shitennou, into betraying  their lord and siding with her in a rebellion of the earth people  against the Moon Kingdom. It was a double betrayal, however. Princess  Serenity’s guardian Senshi, Princesses Mercury, Mars, Venus and Jupiter  had each fallen in love with one of the Prince’s guard. The Shitennou  thus betrayed not just their prince, but the love of the four guardian  princesses as well.”</p>
<p>She motioned for Michiru to walk over to a  scale and started to measure her height. “As a result of the war, the  Moon Kingdom was destroyed just as Nehelenia had predicted it would be.  The Earth Kingdom was likewise decimated back to the stone age, and  mankind was forced back to square one. Along with the four Senshi of  the inner solar system who guarded the princess, there were four other,  far more powerful Senshi; the Senshi of the outer solar system. You  were one of them…”</p>
<p>“Me?” Michiru asked with a start.</p>
<p>“Those  ‘nightmares’ are long forgotten memories of a past life that are only  now resurfacing.” Checking the scale, she nodded. “Right, one hundred  and sixty-three centimeters, or roughly five foot four.”</p>
<p>“But, but that’s crazy.”</p>
<p>“Which  would you say is crazier, Michiru san? That you’re the reincarnated  Princess Neptune of the Silver Millennia whose ancestral castle on the  moon of Triton even now continues to rotate around the planet Neptune,  or that a thirteen year old virgin should be told she’s suddenly been  chosen to carry the son of God?”</p>
<p>“Leave my parents religion out of this,” Michiru grumbled.</p>
<p>“Fair enough, but you are what you are, so you’d best get used to it,” she said as she carefully recorded the freshman’s weight.</p>
<p>“And  what if I don’t wish to ‘get used to it’?” Michiru asked as she pulled  her henshin wand out of her pocket. Like the sea, she was usually able  to hide her feelings beneath a seemingly tranquil surface, but Pluto’s  aloof smugness was slowly stirring her to storm. “What if I gave this  thing back to you and said to hell with fate, moon kingdoms, princesses  and the lot of it?”</p>
<p>“Oh?” Pluto asked as she arched an emerald eyebrow. “And does that mean you’re no longer curious about the blonde or the wind?”</p>
<p>Michiru’s  face fell. Pluto had an ace up her sleeve, and had waited until now to  use it. “We had a deal, Pluto-sama,” she said defensively, “You agreed  not to try to manipulate me.”</p>
<p>Pluto looked at the girl in front  of her thoughtfully for a moment before putting her clipboard down.  “Fair enough,” she said as she sat back down next to Michiru. “The  blonde from your memories is Princess Uranus. She is a fellow Outer  Senshi, and like you she was charged with guarding the outer reaches of  the solar system from hostile invasion and threats both inter and  trans-dimensional. She was also the love of your life, just as you were  the love of hers.”</p>
<p>Michiru was silent as she processed the new information. “I see,” she said finally. “And the wind?”</p>
<p>“The wind can only mean one thing.”</p>
<p>“Which is?”</p>
<p>“She’s  been reincarnated as well, that much is certain. Even now destiny is  slowly but inexorably working behind the scenes to draw us all back  together in this modern era. I’ve yet to find Uranus though, and she is  as yet not fully awakened. However, it would seem that your awakening  has woken up some deep subconscious spark of Uranus within her,  wherever she is, and that spark is calling out to you.”</p>
<p>Michiru crossed her arms again. “And what about my sempai, Miyuki-sama? How does she fit into all this?”</p>
<p>Pluto’s eyes held a certain melancholy in them as they looked upon the younger Senshi. “She doesn’t.”</p>
<p>Michiru looked perturbed. “But, how do you know? What if she’s Uranus? Wouldn’t that explain these feelings I have for her?”</p>
<p>“She isn’t. I’ve observed her long enough to be sure of that.”</p>
<p>“But…  Okay, she’s not Uranus. Fair enough. Just because Uranus is out there  somewhere and she and I were supposedly once in love doesn’t  necessarily mean…”</p>
<p>“You’re forgetting destiny, Michiru-san.”</p>
<p>Michiru  glared at Pluto. “I never asked for destiny to pick me, nor did I ever  ask to be chosen by you or anybody else to save the world either. I’m  just a school girl who dreams of being a violinist some day, or am I to  toss my own dreams out the window now that you tell me all this?”</p>
<p>“Michiru…”</p>
<p>“No,”  she said as she tossed her wand to the floor in front of Pluto. “I’ve  heard enough. Today was the last straw. Find someone else to give up  their life for you, I <strong>quit</strong>!” She then turned and stormed out of the room.</p>
<p>Pluto  sighed as she picked up the henshin wand. “Stubborn and strong willed  as ever,” she remarked. The girl came from a privileged background, and  was clearly used to getting what she wanted. Finding out there were  forces beyond her control was obviously something new to her. Pluto  held up her own henshin wand, her nurse’s outfit disappearing in a  bright flash of purple light, to be replaced by her familiar sailor  fuku. Her time staff materialized in her hand, and she quickly used it  to open the Time Gate.</p>
<p>“Serenity-sama,” Pluto muttered as she disappeared into the gate, “Wherever you are, you should’ve set aside a third cat.”</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>“But  what I don’t understand is why Joan of Arc,” Takayo said as she, Miyuki  and Chieko sat in the small waiting area of the first aide station. “I  mean, doesn’t every girl’s school do Joan of Arc?”</p>
<p>“It was either  that or the story of Saint Maria Goretti.” Miyuki answered with a  shrug. “And Principal Ichi vetoed that one because of the whole rape  issue.”</p>
<p>“Figures,” Chieko said with a roll of her eyes, “A girl  dying during an attempted rape is too much for us young girls, but a  girl being burned at the stake is just fine.”</p>
<p>Miyuki and Takayo  began to laugh, when the door to the waiting area was thrown open and a  visibly upset Michiru came into the room. “Michiru-chan?” Takayo asked,  “Are you alright?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” she answered curtly. “Can we go now, please?”</p>
<p>A  short time later, the four girls were making their way past the booths  and attractions of the fair towards the exit. Michiru didn’t mean to  make the others leave early, but she had to get out of the fairgrounds  and try to think. She couldn’t detect any sort of deception on Pluto’s  part during the conversation in the exam room, but that didn’t make  some of Pluto’s revelations any easier to believe. Evil queens, moon  kingdoms, curses and wars between the earth and the moon were the stuff  of fairy tales.</p>
<p>It was the destiny part though that she was  having the hardest part dealing with. She may have once been this  ‘Princess Neptune’ with a castle on Triton that Pluto talked of, but  she was Michiru Kaioh now. She had her own set of hopes and dreams, and  she felt no particular duty to fulfill some sort of obligation left  over from a previous life. And as for fate working to somehow draw all  the past members of the moon kingdom back together…</p>
<p>“Michiru-chan, look out!”</p>
<p>Miyuki’s  voice pulled the freshman out of her thoughts just in time to avoid  colliding with two older boys. “G… Gomen,” she said as she blushed in  embarrassment.</p>
<p>“It’s alright,” the taller of the two, a handsome dark-haired senior, answered. “It was my fault really.”</p>
<p>The  two groups separated. Once the girls were out of earshot, the  dark-haired boy’s friend turned to him with a grin. “You know Mamoru,  one of these days you’re going to end up colliding with someone.”</p>
<p>Mamoru put his hand to his forehead and grimaced. “I know Motoki, I know…”</p>
<p>Meanwhile,  as Chieko and Takayo talked of how cute the two boys were, Michiru  looked over to Miyuki. She wasn’t sure what, if anything, was there,  but she decided that she was going to find out. And if Pluto or destiny  or anyone else didn’t like it, that was their problem.</p>
<p>Miyuki was  suddenly surprised to feel a hand brushing up against hers. Looking  over, she saw Michiru smiling up at her, her eyes sparkling in the  fading sunlight as they left the fair grounds. Smiling back, the junior  took her hand, the two of them interweaving their fingers as they  followed Takayo and Chieko into the parking lot.</p>
