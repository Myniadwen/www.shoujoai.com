<h1>In the Sun (part 3 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/literalmeta.html">Literal Metaphor</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/inthesun-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>	The Sailor V video game theme song rang out loud and clear through 
the soundless classroom.  
	Minako swallowed hard as the white-haired algebra teacher turned a 
stern look on her, as well as the entire class whose attention was drawn 
to Minako&#39;s vibrating schoolbag.  
	&quot;Aino, that&#39;d better not be a cellular device I hear.  You know 
very well that they are not allowed in school.&quot;  
	Minako looked around, thinking fast, she didn&#39;t want the old bag 
to confiscate her cell phone, especially since she just downloaded that 
Sailor V ring tone.  
	&quot;No, no, Sensei, you&#39;ve got it all wrong.  That&#39;s my calculator 
you hear.  It&#39;s a brand new model, with the latest high-tech audio 
thingies.  I just got a problem correct, and the calculator 
congratulated me.  That&#39;s merely the sound of success.&quot;
	The teacher&#39;s drooping moustache twitched as he was about to 
reply, but to Minako&#39;s great relief the bell rang.  He only set his 
stony eyes on Minako and narrowed his them.  &quot;Class is dismissed.  Aino 
if your &#39;calculator&#39; ever goes off again, it will end up out the 
window.&quot;
	&quot;I gotchya.&quot;  The blonde sped out of the classroom as fast as 
possible with Ami and Usagi right behind her.  
	&quot;Mina-chan, you certainly aren&#39;t getting on Amagasaki-sensei&#39;s 
good side.&quot; Ami commented, trying to hide her amusement.
	Usagi however openly rolled with laughter at Minako&#39;s misfortune.  
&quot;You said it, Ami-chan.&quot;
	&quot;Ha ha, go ahead and laugh.  I&#39;m sure he loves you, Usagi, after 
your last test grade.&quot;
	&quot;Hey, that&#39;s uncalled for!&quot;
	Minako shrugged as she fished her phone out of her school bag.  
&quot;Rei knows better than to call me during school, she wouldn&#39;t have time 
anyway.  I hope there&#39;s not an emergency...&quot;  She froze as she saw the 
number and corresponding name flashing across the screen of her phone.
	Usagi and Ami stopped as she did.  &quot;Mina-chan, what&#39;s wrong?  Is 
there an emergency?&quot;  Ami asked, worried.
	Minako&#39;s hands were trembling slightly and her face was 
expression-less.  Slowly her eyebrows knitted together and she bit her 
lip.  &quot;There might be.&quot;  Breathing in strongly, she showed her friends 
the name that had called her.  
	Usagi took the phone from her, wondering why this was affecting 
Mina so much.  &quot;Alan?&quot;

	Rei&#39;s twinkling laughter echoed against the walls of the 
sacred-fire room.  The fire blazed, ebbing and flowing, seemingly to the 
synch of the miko&#39;s moods.  Rei and Akako sat in front of it, enjoying 
it&#39;s warmth as well as soaking up its energy.
	&quot;You&#39;re funny, Akako-san.  It&#39;s such a relief.&quot;
	Akako turned her chocolate brown eyes on Rei and swept some of her 
long, shadowy black hair back.  &quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot;
	&quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong, but I thought it was going to be a pain to 
have to teach you.&quot;  Rei chuckled at the look she received from her 
fellow miko.  &quot;Don&#39;t give me that look.  You&#39;re far from a pain, 
actually.  I like you.&quot;
	Akako looked back at the fire.  &quot;You like me, huh?&quot;
	Rei raised an eyebrow at this nonchalant sort of question.  
&quot;Yeah.&quot;  She too looked at the fire.  &quot;But don&#39;t get your hopes up.  I&#39;m 
taken.&quot;
	Akako&#39;s burst of laughter surprised Rei.  &quot;Rei-san you are quite 
arrogant.  But it&#39;s okay.&quot;  She grinned.  &quot;Your girlfriend&#39;s pretty 
hot.&quot;
	Rei&#39;s eyes bugged out.  She put a hand down and got into Akako&#39;s 
face, who was mildly surprised by the other miko&#39;s sudden irritation.  
&quot;I know.  That&#39;s why she&#39;s my girlfriend.  Mine.&quot;  Rei&#39;s threatening 
stance weakened, as she realized Akako was still grinning.  
	The calmer miko put a hand on her shoulder and gently pushed her 
into her former position.  &quot;Relax.  I&#39;m not here to sweep your woman off 
her feet and right from under your nose.  Well, at least now that I see 
you&#39;re slightly psychotic.&quot;
	Rei continued to glare at her.  &quot;I sure am, pal.&quot;  She turned her 
gaze back to the sacred fire and immediately her anger melted away.  She 
chuckled.  &quot;You&#39;re pretty arrogant yourself, Tora-san.&quot;
	&quot;Am I?&quot;
	&quot;Sure.  What makes you think Minako would fall for you, over some 
good lovin&#39; like me?&quot;
	Akako had to laugh at Rei&#39;s sudden sexually confident attitude.  
&quot;So much egotism between two people can&#39;t be good.&quot;  She commented 
before turning to Rei.  &quot;You know how I know?  Because I could probably 
have you too.&quot;
	It was Rei&#39;s turn to laugh, and she did so loud and haughtily.  
&quot;You&#39;re full of it-&quot;
	She was cut short as she was suddenly pressed to the floor, her 
arms pinned, and Akako&#39;s weight hovering above her.  She gasped shakily, 
the innocent-looking brown-eyed girl&#39;s lips swiftly, dangerously close 
to hers.
	Akako grinned, looking down at Rei, chest heaving and her cheeks 
pink.  &quot;Open your eyes.&quot;
	Rei hadn&#39;t realized that they were closed.  Akako abruptly got to 
her feet and extended a hand to Rei, who knocked it away after taking a 
few minutes to let her brain catch up.
	Akako shrugged.  &quot;Don&#39;t be mad.  I just wanted to prove you wrong; 
it&#39;s something we arrogant people like to do.&quot;  
	Rei hated the smug smile she wore as she left the room.

	Makoto jumped back and assumed a defensive stance.  &quot;Come out and 
I won&#39;t hurt you.  That much.&quot;  She warned the intruder she caught 
scurrying around in her apartment upon entering.  
	&quot;Take it easy, baby.&quot;  Freddy emerged from the bedroom with his 
hands above his head.  &quot;Actually, I like playing good cop, bad cop.&quot;  He 
snickered.
	Makoto relaxed, but put her head in her hands.  &quot;What are you 
doing here?  Were you here all day?&quot;
	&quot;Not all day.  I went out to buy some stuff.&quot;
	Makoto dropped her school bag to the floor and walked past him to 
her bedroom.  He followed her but the door was shut in his face.
	&quot;Are you at me or something?  You said I could stay as long as I 
wanted to.&quot;
	Makoto did remember saying that, but she didn&#39;t think he&#39;d 
actually follow up on it.  A person couldn&#39;t be held responsible for 
what they say after reaching the heights of sexual pleasure for the 
first time in months.  She opened the door, having changed out of her 
school uniform.
	&quot;I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d stay the entire day.  Didn&#39;t you go to 
class? You should have least went home to change.&quot;
	Freddy looked down at the outfit he had been wearing for the past 
two days.  He struggled to find an explanation.  &quot;I only had two classes 
today; I wouldn&#39;t have learned anything anyway.&quot;  Makoto&#39;s disappointed 
look wounded him.  &quot;If I leave...  Where would I go?&quot;
	&quot;What do you mean?&quot;  
	&quot;My parents don&#39;t live around here and my roommate is basically 
kicking me out.  I only have you.&quot;
	Makoto&#39;s head suddenly began to throb.  She had to sit down.  
&quot;What are you saying?  You have no where else to go?  You want to stay 
here.  With me?&quot;
	Freddy dumped himself next to her on the couch and put his head on 
her shoulder.  &quot;Yeah, with you.&quot;  He slid down and ended up on his 
knees, holding her hands in his.  &quot;Makoto, this is gonna sound... weird.  
But it&#39;s the truth.&quot; He kissed her unexpectedly.  &quot;I love you.&quot;
	Years ago Makoto&#39;s answer would have been automatic.  But years 
ago she was a different person.  She sighed and brushed his unruly black 
hair away from his eyes.
	&quot;You&#39;ll have to help pay the rent.&quot;

	Minako didn&#39;t even know why she was there.  Since that call she 
felt like she didn&#39;t know anything anymore.  She breathed deeply trying 
to keep her mind at ease.  She was only there at Crown so she could see 
Alan, as a long-time friend, to catch up, and ask about Katarina.  All 
that nonsense she felt a long time ago, didn&#39;t matter now.  She was 
grown up now.  She had Rei now.
	She caught sight of him as he entered, looking much the same as 
she remembered him.  He was the classic definition of tall, dark, and 
handsome.
	Minako felt like dying.  Her palms were cold and sweaty, and for 
the life of her she couldn&#39;t get her heart to slow down.  &quot;Come on, Aino 
get a hold of yourself.&quot;
	&quot;Minako, you&#39;ll never get over the habit of talking to yourself.  
Or do you still talk to that cat?&quot;
	Minako jumped, realizing his presence standing there in front of 
her.  She laughed nervously; she had already made a fool of herself.  
She looked up from her feet and raised her eyes all the way to his, a 
good six inches above her.  He smiled.
	&quot;Alan.&quot;  She whispered.
	&quot;It&#39;s good to see you old chum.&quot;
	She nodded, not finding words.  His eyes still had that childlike 
sparkle, although he did seem to have aged.  &quot;How have you been 
keeping?&quot;
	She had to look away so she could answer him.  &quot;I&#39;ve been great.  
Life is wonderful, I can&#39;t complain.&quot;  
	&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; He laughed, &quot;You&#39;ve found a good man, haven&#39;t you?&quot;
	Minako laughed along with him.  She put her hands in her pockets 
to keep them from trembling.  &quot;You could say that.  And you?  How is 
Katarina?&quot;
	She was surprised to see his smile fade.  &quot;Well, that&#39;s part of 
the reason I left London...&quot;  Minako&#39;s eyes searched for more 
explanation.  &quot;Katarina and I...  It didn&#39;t work out.  We recently...  
Well, you don&#39;t mind if we just avoid this subject, do you old chum?&quot;	
	&quot;Um, oh no, its fine with me, I completely understand...  I&#39;m 
sorry.&quot;
	&quot;Me too.&quot;
	The silence seemed to be one of mourning and Minako shifted 
uncomfortably.  Her heart rate had resumed its normal beat and she was 
able to look at Alan now without it thumping out of control.  
	&quot;So,&quot; He finally said something, &quot;Tell me about your little 
affair.&quot;
	Minako smiled and looked at the floor.  She felt secure again as 
she thought of Rei.  &quot;What can I say?  I&#39;m in love.  It&#39;s magnificent.&quot;
	&quot;You, Minako?  In love?  You must tell me about this lucky bloke.&quot;
	&quot;Kind of like you Alan.&quot;  His surprised look amused Minako and she 
laughed musically.  &quot;Tall, dark, &#39;handsome&#39;.  Beautiful, deep eyes.  
They can see right to the bottom of your soul.  Burning and full of 
passion.  And when those eyes set their gaze on you...  It&#39;s like you 
can&#39;t escape.  But you don&#39;t want to either.&quot;  
	Alan tried to look at what Minako&#39;s eyes were fixed on, but she 
was not there with him, she was far off, somewhere else.  
	&quot;So you&#39;ve become a romantic, have you?&quot;
	She smiled, and shook her head.  &quot;No.  I&#39;m just less cynical.  It 
was hard to be romantic in England, doing what I had to do.  Seeing what 
I had to see.&quot;
	&quot;Y&#39;know Katarina once had this crazy notion that you were in love 
with me.&quot;
	She looked into those dark blue eyes.  They didn&#39;t go deep enough 
for her.
	&quot;It was nice to see you again Alan.&quot;
	Alan looked on, speechless, as Minako got up and left without 
another word.	
	&quot;Mina, what are you doing here?  I didn&#39;t know you were coming.&quot;
	Minako put her arms around Rei&#39;s waist and rested her head on her 
shoulder.  &quot;I needed to be with you.&quot;
	Rei just kissed the girls forehead and enjoyed her warmth.

	&quot;I have to admit, I was really surprised when you called me.  
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m glad you called, I just wasn&#39;t expecting it.  
Because we haven&#39;t really hung out in a long time, but I do love hanging 
out with you.&quot;
	Ami barely heard a word he said.  &quot;Well thanks for coming 
Ryu-kun.&quot;  She sipped her soda and hoped she didn&#39;t look as bored as she 
was.  
	&quot;So where are all your friends?  You&#39;re usually with them.&quot;
	&quot;They&#39;re busy.  Besides I felt like spending time with you today.&quot;  
Ami gulped, not even believing what she was about to say.  &quot;Alone.  Just 
you and me.&quot;
	Urawa Ryu couldn&#39;t contain the joy spilling forth from him.  
&quot;I-I&#39;ve been thinking about you lately.  Not really predictions...   But 
I&#39;m hoping whatever I&#39;m thinking can come true.&quot;  He grinned and inched 
closer to Ami.  
	She timidly smiled back at him.  Instead of moving back to recover 
that comfortable space she had lost, she resolved to stay put.  &quot;Oh?  
Well, okay...&quot;
	&#39;Goodness, I wish a youma would show up.&#39;  The blue-haired girl 
thought disdainfully, as she listened to Urawa&#39;s inane chattering.  
	&quot;...But seriously Ami-chan, you&#39;re one of the most beautiful girls 
I know.  Not to mention the fact that you&#39;re brilliant.&quot;
	Ami&#39;s ears caught this bit.  She turned surprised eyes on him.  
&quot;Do you really think so Ryu-kun?&quot;  
	&quot;I swear it Ami-chan.&quot;
	She smiled feeling much better about having him around.  Their 
conversation suddenly became more interesting and to Ami&#39;s delight Urawa 
seemed to have developed a slight charm.  She found herself laughing at 
one of his jokes.  
	&quot;And the biologist says to his assistant, that&#39;s not an effluvium 
patient, that&#39;s my wife!&quot;  Urawa grinned, he had Ami laughing.  She hit 
him playfully.
	&quot;Oh, Ryu-kun, you&#39;re too much.&quot;  
	&quot;You must have the prettiest laugh I&#39;ve ever heard.&quot;
	The non-sequitor threw Ami, making her look away coyly, and 
turning her complexion pink.  She noticed Urawa moving closer.  
	&#39;He&#39;s not going to... is he?  Oh he is.  Kami...&#39;  Ami was frozen 
and her treasured mental processing rate seemed to be broken.  Her eyes 
drifted slowly closed and her lips puckered slightly.  It was finally 
happening.  It was happening with Urawa, but still, it was happening.
	&quot;Ami-chan?&quot;
	Her senses snapped back to her when she heard the voice.  Both she 
and Urawa jolted away from each other.  Ami kicked herself mentally when 
she saw who it was.
	&quot;Hello Mako-chan, Freddy-san.&quot;  
	Makoto took a good look at Ami.  Her cheeks were bright pink and 
she was breathing quite rapidly.  &quot;How ya doin&#39;, Ami-chan?&quot;  She elbowed 
Freddy in the ribs, who gave her a brief greeting.
	&quot;Just fine.  You remember Urawa Ryu?&quot;
	&quot;I sure do.&quot;  Makoto grinned at the two of them.  &quot;Well it seems 
you two, are &#39;busy&#39;,&quot; She teased them purposely. &quot;We&#39;ll just be at the 
counter.&quot;
	&quot;No, no!&quot; Ami regained her composure.  &quot;It&#39;s fine.  Please, join 
us.  You don&#39;t mind, do you Ryu-kun?&quot;
	Urawa really did mind, and mind much.  But he could never go 
against Ami&#39;s wishes.  &quot;It&#39;s no problem.&quot;
	The two &quot;couples&quot; sat across from each other and shared an uneasy 
silence.  Freddy looked bored, only taking interest in his double-decker 
hamburger.  Urawa was noticeably peeved at having his Ami-alone-time cut 
short.  Makoto sat straight up and wore an amused smile.  She&#39;d throw 
Freddy a disgusted look once or twice, as he devoured his meal.  And Ami 
sat there trying to figure out just what was happening.  
	At times like these it was best to think scientifically (at least 
for her).  Urawa sat on her left, an old friend, potential dating 
prospect, his intentions were blatant.  Freddy sat across from him, 
someone she hardly knew anything about except that for some reason he 
held Makoto&#39;s affection.  Makoto was across from her, watching her make 
her observations.  Their eyes met but Ami didn&#39;t waiver.
	Makoto...  A paradox.  Unfathomable.  Damn science, it was 
useless.  She was unclassifiable.  Her Mona-Lisa smile above all else, 
baffled Ami.  
	Freddy, fully satiated, put his arm around Makoto, who remained 
still.
	Urawa narrowed his eyes at Freddy, who he thought was making a 
mockery of him.  He yawned and stretched, putting the oldest trick in 
the book to work.  Unfortunately, Ami rose from the table before his arm 
could land around her shoulders.  
	&quot;I think I&#39;ll go get us some milkshakes.&quot;
	Makoto followed her.  &quot;I&#39;ll help you carry them.&quot;  They sat at the 
counter now, keeping a wary eye on the boys.
	&quot;So, Urawa&#39;s finally making a move on you, huh?&quot;  Makoto seemed to 
have found enjoyment in the whole thing.
	&quot;I wouldn&#39;t say that.  I suppose it was all meant to happen.  He 
is the only male I&#39;m very comfortable with, well besides Mamoru-kun, but 
he doesn&#39;t count.&quot;
	&quot;Ami-chan,&quot; Makoto was using an admonishing tone, &quot;You&#39;re not 
telling me that you&#39;ve just decided to settle for Urawa, are you?&quot;
	&quot;That&#39;s a bit harsh.  Not &#39;settling&#39;, no.  I told you, it just 
seems like it should happen this way.&quot;
	&quot;What should happen?&quot;
	Ami tapped her fingers on the counter, flashing her eyes briefly 
over Makoto.  &quot;I&#39;m glad for you and Freddy-san, you look very happy.&quot;
	Makoto looked away, towards the table, where Freddy and Urawa were 
appearing to be in conversation with each other.  &quot;I am, I guess.&quot;
	&quot;You guess?&quot;
	&quot;He&#39;s moving in with me.&quot;
	Makoto expected the shock, but not the disappointed look from Ami.  
&quot;Moving in?  That&#39;s an enormous step Mako-chan.  Are you sure you want 
to do this?  Especially, only seeing him now after-&quot;
	Makoto put a hand up to silence her.  &quot;I know, I know Ami-chan.  
I&#39;m not looking forward to that same reaction from the others, 
especially Luna.  But what can I do?  He has no place to go.  And he...&quot;  
Makoto looked away; she didn&#39;t want to tell Ami that bit for some 
reason.
	&quot;He what, Mako-chan?&quot;
	&quot;He... Used the big L.&quot;
	&quot;What?&quot;
	&quot;The L word.  He told me... he loved me.&quot;
	Ami nodded in understanding.  &quot;I see.&quot;  She looked at her hands.  
&quot;And you said the same to him?&quot;
	Makoto laughed cynically.  &quot;That&#39;s the horrible part.  I 
completely ignored it.  He keeps spouting it like, like... I dunno.  But 
I can&#39;t bring myself to say it.&quot;
	Ami exhaled slowly, she felt like a huge cloud of disappointment 
floating over her head had disappeared.
	&quot;Oh.  Well.  Whatever you feel is right, Mako-chan.&quot;  
	Makoto looked at Ami, and her eyebrows furrowed together.  She 
frowned.  &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s right.&quot;
