<h1>Best Friends (part 11 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/desslok.html">Desslok</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/bestfriends-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Makoto drew her coat around her as she darted across the street 
on her way to the shrine.  Usually, she would have gone home 
first to change out of her cooking school uniform.  The ugly 
clothes were the only thing she didn&#39;t enjoy about school.  For 
some reason, though, she hadn&#39;t bothered today.  Instead, she&#39;d 
headed straight to Rei&#39;s.   A car passed and almost drenched her 
speeding through a large puddle.  Makoto moved a bit further from 
the edge of the sidewalk and started up the hill.  She had mixed 
feelings about rain.  For obvious reasons, she enjoyed lightning 
and thunderstorms, but cold, dismal drizzles like this reminded 
her of that night when her first love had broken her heart.  

&#39;I ought to send him a letter and tell the jerk that he was such 
a crappy boyfriend, I turned out gay!&#39; Makoto chuckled to 
herself.  It was odd, though, to think now about the things he&#39;d 
complained about:  she was too boyish, not feminine enough, too 
intimidating, etc.  For so long, she&#39;d tried to prove him wrong, 
taking up cooking and laboring to master all the other 
traditionally &#39;female&#39; skills.   Strangely enough, however, she 
found that she really enjoyed those things.  She loved to cook 
for her friends and she took great pride in keeping her apartment 
neat and tidy.  But, she also loved sports and martial arts and 
other typically &#39;boyish&#39; things.  &#39;Who the hell was he to try to 
put me in some box like that&#39;, she thought, regretting the 
insecurities of her youth.  

The notion that she was a lesbian was still quite novel, both 
terrifying and exciting.  &#39;It&#39;s not official yet,&#39; she lamented, 
though she knew that the verification didn&#39;t come from an event, 
but from the realization.  For the past few days, she&#39;d felt more 
at peace with herself than she had in living memory.  Something 
had just clicked into place.  Part of that was the knowledge that 
her dear little Ami loved her back, just the same way, but that 
wasn&#39;t all of it.  It was something more important than a single 
person loving her (even someone as important as Ami).  It was 
about knowing and loving herself.  

&#39;You could never do that,&#39; she accused her old sempai. &#39;You 
wanted to make me into something I wasn&#39;t, and I almost let you.&#39;  
Makoto knew that Ami would never try to remake her.   How 
wonderful to know that someone could love you for who you were, 
not who you could be or who you used to be or who you appeared 
to be.  

The only experience Makoto really had with lesbians was obviously 
with Haruka and Michiru.  When they&#39;d first met, she&#39;d really 
thought of Haruka as a role model, even before she began to 
suspect the extent to which she meant that.  In some ways, she&#39;d 
wanted to be more like Haruka, and she had become so over the 
last few years: less dependant on others&#39; opinions, more willing 
to take a stand about what was important, consequences be damned.  
At first, she&#39;d been a little jealous of Michiru.  Now, though, 
she found more and more that she wanted to be like her, too.  
Visions danced in her head suddenly.  She wanted to put on 
something frilly and greet Ami after a long day at the hospital 
with a cool drink, a warm snack, and a steamy kiss.   She wanted 
to stroll through the park on a warm day with Ami by her side.  
She could see it as clear as day.  She&#39;d wear her forest green 
skirt, a lacy white blouse, and a pink scarf that would match her 
earrings and a ribbon in her hair.  Makoto actually turned her 
head as she walked, seeing Ami standing next to her in her blue 
slacks, blue vest and white oxford.  She shivered, not from the 
cold.

&#39;You&#39;ll never know what you missed out on, jerk,&#39; Makoto 
concluded with a smile as she passed through the gates.  Rei 
stood on the porch, waiting for her, just out of the rain.

&quot;Hey Mako-chan, I watched you come up here!&quot; Rei called, &quot;What&#39;s 
on your mind that&#39;s got you so focused?&quot;

Makoto grinned, unable to believe the set up she&#39;d just gotten.  
&quot;Why, I was thinking about my old sempai, of course!&quot;

Rei arched both eyebrows in confusion until, seeing Makoto&#39;s 
smile, she relaxed and laughed, slipping an arm around her 
friend&#39;s waist as she got up the stairs.

&quot;Come on, baka! I&#39;ve got some tea brewing and for once, I thought 
I&#39;d make you a meal.  I&#39;m a great cook, too, you know!&quot; Rei 
announced.

&quot;As long as it comes pre-packaged and can fit in a microwave,&quot; 
Makoto commented with a wry glance at the young, annoyingly dry, 
miko.

Rei snorted her displeasure with that comment and escorted Makoto 
to the dining room.   Hot tea did indeed await and Rei poured 
some for each of them as Makoto removed her wet shoes and coat 
and hung them with care by the door.  

For awhile, they simply chatted about this and that.  Makoto 
described some of the things they&#39;d been preparing this week in 
class, which encouraged a suddenly ravenous Rei to go pop lunch 
into the oven.  Rei told Makoto about some of the things going on 
in the shrine. 

&quot;Umino dumped Naru? In a letter?  He&#39;s almost as much of a jerk 
as my old sempai!&quot;

Rei sighed, &quot;Yeah, but I think she&#39;ll be ok.  I don&#39;t even think 
that was why she came here.  I think she&#39;s already getting over 
him.&quot;  Rei turned and looked out the window with a wistful smile. 

&quot;Why did she come then?&quot; Makoto asked.

&quot;Oh, why does anyone come to a temple?&quot; Rei joked with an overly 
light tone.  &quot;Probably to get in out of the rain!  Now, let me go 
get lunch.  You just wait here and let me serve you for once.  
Oh, I bought cookies, too!&quot; she added as she left the room.

Makoto nodded and settled back with her cup, watching the rain 
fall outside.  Both the tea and Rei were making her feel quite 
warm and cozy.  She really loved the shrine.  It was so peaceful, 
and it held so many happy memories.  She could see why Ami spent 
so much of her free time helping out here.  Thoughts of Ami 
reminded her of the likely reasons Rei had invited her over, 
though.  While she wasn&#39;t exactly angry with Ami for having Rei 
call her instead of calling herself, she certainly wasn&#39;t 
thrilled with her either.  &#39;I&#39;m going to have to make her pay for 
that,&#39; Makoto decided with a sinister smile.  As her mind 
wandered over the various ways she could exact her vengeance, her 
expression shifted from sinister to steamy.  

&quot;I really hope you&#39;re not thinking of your old sempai again,&quot; Rei 
told her, arriving back, bowls in hand.  Her taunting smile 
brought sweat to Makoto&#39;s brow.  

&quot;No, I .. uh.. it smells good!&quot; Makoto all but shouted.  

Rei let her off the hook this time, happy in the knowledge that 
she&#39;d busted her friend.  The last time she&#39;d seen that 
expression on someone&#39;s face, Usagi had been relating some quite 
intimate details about her last meeting with Mamoru.  Of course, 
no one else had been particularly interested in hearing such 
things, but neither had they really tried to stop her.  Reminders 
of Usagi and Mamoru were not going to help Rei&#39;s mood, though, so 
she quickly dropped that line of thought.
	
After they got most of the way through the noodle dishes, Rei 
decided she&#39;d better get on to business, before Makoto made some 
excuse to leave.  &quot;So, were you mad at Ami for having me call 
you?&quot; she asked, figuring she might as well be direct.

Makoto smiled, &quot;Funny you should ask. I was trying to decide 
while you were getting lunch ready. I don&#39;t think so.  Mostly, 
I&#39;m annoyed.&quot;

&quot;Annoyed?&quot; Rei urged her to continue.

&quot;She had to go cause her mom called her,&quot; Makoto explained, &quot;and 
I can understand that.  Do you know much about Ami&#39;s mom?&quot;

Rei thought for a moment.  She knew that Ami&#39;s mom was a doctor, 
of course, and worked in a hospital.  She could guess now which 
one.  She had a vague memory of Ami saying something about making 
cookies with her mom as a child.  &quot;No, not really,&quot; she admitted.

Makoto nodded, not surprised. &quot;Well, it&#39;s not something Ami talks 
about often, but her mom can be pretty tough on her.  Ami doesn&#39;t 
complain, but she really rides her hard, about her grades and 
classes and stuff.  I can see why Ami would dash off like that.&quot;

The final pieces came together for Rei.  She&#39;d known, of course, 
that that jerk Urawa had done something.  She&#39;d seen him herself. 
Once she recalled that Ami&#39;s mom worked in a hospital, she&#39;d been 
all but certain that that was why he had gone there.  Now, she 
knew for sure.  That would have to wait, though.  

&quot;If you understand, why are you annoyed?&quot; Rei asked carefully.

Makoto&#39;s eyes flashed, &quot;I understand why she left, Rei-chan, but 
not why she didn&#39;t call me herself.&quot;

&quot;I thought you said you understood her message, about finishing 
dinner,&quot; Rei replied, trying to soothe Makoto with her voice.

Apparently, it worked, as Makoto slumped down in her seat. &quot;I do. 
I did. I don&#39;t know.  Rei-chan?&quot;  Makoto looked up and caught 
Rei&#39;s eyes with her own serious gaze.

&quot;Yes, Mako-chan?&quot;

&#39;Coming to terms with it means sharing it with your friends,&#39; 
Makoto decided. &quot;Rei-chan, when her mom called, well...we 
were about to kiss.  For the first time... first time like that 
anyway.  I.. I love her, Rei-chan, and I&#39;m pretty sure she loves 
me, too.&quot;  She exhaled deeply, feeling yet another weight fall 
off of her shoulders.

&quot;Ohhhhh,&quot; Rei sighed happily.  &quot;Ohh, Mako-chan,&quot; Rei sighed 
again, disappointed for her friend.  

Makoto&#39;s eyes trembled. &quot;And I haven&#39;t seen her since, or even 
heard from her.  She told me...you told me...that she didn&#39;t 
regret it, that she wanted to, next time we saw each other, but 
why hasn&#39;t she called me?&quot;  Makoto bristled with tears and 
frustration.  

&quot;Silly Mako-chan,&quot; Rei explained, patting her friend&#39;s hand, 
&quot;you&#39;ve answered your own question. She&#39;s decided that next time 
she sees you, she wants to finish what got interrupted.  She&#39;s 
saving herself until she can do it right.&quot;

Makoto looked up, smiling tentatively. &quot;She&#39;s always been a 
perfectionist.&quot;

&quot;Yes, and she can also be really stupid sometimes!&quot;  Rei snorted 
with exasperation. &quot;A first kiss isn&#39;t perfect because of when or 
how it happens.  A first kiss is perfect because of the love it 
signifies.&quot;

&quot;Ooo, that&#39;s good!&quot; Makoto declared, sitting up straight.  &quot;Can I 
use that?&quot;

&quot;Sure, but eventually you have to give me credit.  Wisdom is my 
job, after all!&quot; Rei laughed, gesturing to her miko outfit.  

&quot;Kinda bad timing on her mom&#39;s part, though,&quot; Makoto grumbled. 
&quot;Just my luck, I guess.&quot;

Rei&#39;s expression became much more serious.  &quot;Not luck, Mako-chan.  
That call didn&#39;t just happen.&quot;  Seeing Makoto&#39;s confusion, Rei 
continued. &quot;Her mom called at that time because someone had told 
her where Ami was, and must have implied something about what she 
was doing.&quot;

Makoto shot up out of her chair. &quot;What?! Who?!! Why?!!!&quot; she 
stammered, trying to come to terms with this news.

Rei also stood, albeit much more slowly, and moved next to her 
friend.  &quot;Take a deep breath, Mako-chan.  Everything will be all 
right.  Calm down.  Ami&#39;s friend, Urawa, visited the hospital 
where Ami&#39;s mom works that same night, probably right around the 
time you guys were finishing your dinner.&quot;

&quot;How do you know that?&quot; Makoto demanded.

Rei breathed heavily, &quot;It&#39;s a bit of a long story...&quot;  She 
proceeded to explain to Makoto about Minako and Kenjo&#39;s theory, 
mentioning briefly that she&#39;d suspected Ami&#39;s feelings herself, 
along with Usagi&#39;s observations of things over the years.  She 
told her about their decision to try to help, about Haruka&#39;s 
advice, about her own suspicions regarding Urawa and her actions 
following him.  

About halfway through, Makoto leaned back against the wall, arms 
crossed.  Eventually, Rei ran out of narrative.  &quot;Haruka-san was 
right, Rei-chan,&quot; Makoto observed, &quot;we were doing just fine on 
our own.&quot; She laughed briefly, &quot;Damn that &#39;Shinoko&#39;, I&#39;ll never 
hear the end of it that he figured it out before me, even if it 
was only by a day or so.&quot;

Rei felt quite relieved that Makoto was not (yet) running out the 
door to track down Urawa.  &quot;We didn&#39;t want to interfere, Mako-
chan.  We just love you both and we all think you could be very 
happy together.&quot;

Makoto simply smiled in agreement at that.

&quot;But, I just knew that guy was up to something, coming here out 
of the blue and then running off for no good reason,&quot; Rei 
continued, her voice starting to lose its calm. &quot;I&#39;m glad I 
followed him!  Otherwise, we might never have known and poor Ami-
chan might still think he was a friend.&quot;

&quot;Does Ami-chan know?&quot; Makoto asked quietly.

&quot;Hai. Usagi went over there this morning and was going to tell 
her.  Usagi is good with that kind of thing,&quot; Rei pointed out.

&quot;She is,&quot; Makoto agreed. Slowly, she moved away from the wall, 
standing straight.  &quot;Well, it&#39;s been quite a week, Rei-chan.  
Even though I said Haruka-san was right, I am happy you all were 
watching out for us.  Thank you.&quot;

Rei stood with a suspicious look, uncertain about her friend&#39;s 
mood or plans. &quot;You&#39;re not going to do anything rash, are you?&quot;

Makoto stunned Rei by laughing happily, &quot;Me?  No, of course not.  
Well, I&#39;m going to get ready for my shift tonight at the 
restaurant and tomorrow I&#39;m going to beat Kenjo-chan just that 
much more thoroughly so I&#39;ll have some ammunition when he tries 
to give me grief about this.&quot;

&quot;But, what about Urawa?  Aren&#39;t you mad?  I know I want to go and 
toast the sniveling little bastard, and you&#39;ve got a lot more 
reason than me!&quot;  Rei flared hotly, finally losing her temper 
completely and quite miserably failing to demonstrate the kind of 
calm she had been urging on her friend.

Makoto patiently laid a hand on Rei&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Of course I&#39;m 
mad, Rei-chan, but it&#39;s not about me.&quot;  Makoto paused to gather 
her thoughts.  &quot;You see, part of my job as Sailor Jupiter is to 
protect Sailor Mercury.   It&#39;s one of my favorite parts of the 
job, truthfully.  But, this isn&#39;t about Sailor Mercury.  It&#39;s 
about Mizuno Ami.  He&#39;s her &#39;friend&#39;; he spoke to her mother; 
it&#39;s her problem to deal with.  Not mine.  I&#39;ll be here for her, 
before and after, but I won&#39;t fight her battles for her.  Nor 
would she want me to.  I respect her too much for that.&quot;

Suddenly Rei felt ashamed. Seeing this, Makoto reached down to 
the table and handed Rei a cookie that had been left over from 
dessert.  &quot;Ami-chan will sort it out, and then she and I will 
sort our situation out.  If there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve learned being 
a sailor scout, it&#39;s that love triumphs over all.&quot;

Rei smiled, comforted by the thought, even if she was not quite 
so certain of it as Makoto.  &#39;Easy for you to say,&#39; she thought 
briefly. &#39;Your love is not unrequited.&#39;  Realizing that such 
ideas were petty, especially at a time like this, Rei shook them 
off and gave Makoto a hug.  

Makoto held her friend gently, realizing not for the first time 
how truly blessed she was to have friends...to have a 
family...like this.   Gathering her coat and putting on her 
shoes, she left without another word.  Something else she&#39;d 
learned was that when you said a cool tagline, you didn&#39;t mess it 
up by adding anything.

After Makoto left, Rei cleaned up the dishes and came to a 
decision.  

BEEP  &quot;Usagi?  It&#39;s me, Rei.  I know you&#39;re in class now, but 
when you get home, give me a call.  I thought maybe we could get 
together tonight, and no, not to spy on Mina.  Maybe we could go 
shopping or something?  Hey, why don&#39;t you invite Naru-san as 
well!  I bet she&#39;d like to get out, too.  Give me a call when you 
get in!  Bye!&quot;
