<h1>Megatokyo Burning (part 4 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/megaburn-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>        Sylia Stingray looked out at the city of Megatokyo, wishing for 
a moment that things could be simpler. Her silvery hair flowed down her 
shoulders, the dress she wore highlighting her sinfully long legs and 
rounded hips.

        &quot;You really shouldn&#39;t do that,&quot; Mara murmured, wrapping her arms 
around Sylia from behind, &quot;you know how tempting you are to me.&quot; The 
tawny haired woman tightened her grip a moment, releasing her only when 
she felt no response. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; she asked softly.

        Sylia turned her head slightly, kissing Mara gently. &quot;Nene 
called a meeting,&quot; she answered softly, reaching up to stroke her cheek.

        &quot;You think she intends to resign?&quot; Mara asked softly.

        &quot;I think so,&quot; Sylia sighed. She turned back to look out the 
window, &quot;She really is getting to old to continue operating her armor.&quot;

        Mara sighed softly. &quot;If I could so something,&quot; the former demon 
said with a sigh, &quot;you know I would.&quot; A flash of a smile, &quot;You know I 
like that crazy hacker.&quot;

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; Sylia sighed. She saw a flash of light on the street 
below, smiling slightly as two cycles pulled up, &quot;Looks like Urd and 
Priss have arrived.&quot;

        Priss Asagiri smiled as she pulled her helmet off, setting it 
down gently on top of her cycle&#39;s fuel tank. The dark brown hair fell 
down into her face a bit messily, giving her a handsomely rakish sort of 
look. She looked over at Urd climbing off her own cycle, who was clearly 
admiring the skintight riding leathers that both of them were wearing.

        &quot;Do we have to go?&quot; Urd asked with a seductive little smile, &quot;I 
can think of much better things to be doing with our time.&quot;

        Priss chuckled, &quot;Sorry love, Sylia said it was important.&quot; The 
two women walked into the Silky Doll together as she added quietly, &quot;And 
who knows, it might be another KS job.&quot;

        &quot;Fair enough,&quot; Urd agreed with a smile as both of them took the 
elevator up to Sylia&#39;s suite, &quot;those are always fun.&quot;

        &quot;You have a interesting definition of fun,&quot; Priss laughed.

        &quot;It took you long enough,&quot; Mara said dryly as they entered the 
living room, Urd casually flipping her the bird in return.

        &quot;I think she&#39;s picking up your bad habits,&quot; Sylia noted but 
Priss just grinned.

        &quot;So what&#39;s the agenda?&quot; Priss asked as Urd poured them both a 
drink from the bar.

        &quot;I&#39;m not sure myself,&quot; Sylia acknowledged, &quot;Nene was the one who 
called it.&quot;

        Urd chuckled as she looked up at Sylia thoughtfully and 
remarked, &quot;Of course it&#39;s driving you nuts not knowing.&quot;

        &quot;She&#39;s got you there love,&quot; Mara smiled, her gentle tone taking 
any sting from the words.

        Sylia looked out again to see Linna and Belldandy arrive in 
their car, waiting until Nene and Mackie joined them before the four 
headed inside. &#39;Which just leaves Skuld,&#39; Sylia thought.

        Almost on cue the elevator &#39;dinged&#39; as Skuld emerged, the black 
haired teenager wiping grease off of her hands. She wore her coveralls, 
a clean pair thankfully, and her eyes were bright with curiosity. &quot;So 
what&#39;s going on?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;Nene called the meeting,&quot; Urd informed her, &quot;you&#39;ll have to ask 
her.&quot;

        Before Skuld could ask anything more the elevator opened up 
behind her and the other four trooped out. &quot;Congratulations on your 
promotion, Nene,&quot; Linna was saying as they headed for any available 
seats, her light brown hair neat in a business woman&#39;s style.

        &quot;You&#39;ve earned it,&quot; Belldandy said with a gentle smile.

        &quot;It is kind of cool to be a full lieutenant,&quot; Nene admitted, the 
little blonde holding Mackie&#39;s hand. She looked good, though not as 
youthful as the others in the room.

        &quot;About time you got here,&quot; Urd, Mara and Priss all said at the 
same time, exchanging surprised glances once they spoke.

        Nene actually stuck her tongue out at them, &quot;I needed to check 
some things.&quot; She looked over at Skuld, &quot;You aren&#39;t rebuilding the 
Hardsuits again, are you?&quot;

        Skuld pouted, &quot;I got into enough trouble for that the last 
time.&quot;

        &quot;Yo,&quot; Priss gave Nene a casual wave, getting a raspberry of her 
own from Nene in return. &quot;What did I do?&quot; she protested.

        &quot;She&#39;ll think of something,&quot; Mackie offered with a grin, the 
black haired young man mixing drinks for him and her.

        Sylia&#39;s eyes twinkled dangerously as she smoothly said, &quot;How are 
those purchases from the Silky Doll working out, Nene?&quot;

        Both Nene and Mackie&#39;s cheeks went bright red at that. &quot;Just 
fine, thank you,&quot; she managed to say with as much dignity as she could 
manage.

        A bit more gravely Sylia said, &quot;You called this meeting, Nene.&quot; 
She studied Nene a moment, &quot;What&#39;s the situation?&quot;

        Nene nodded gravely, getting up from her seat before taking a 
bracing drink and setting her glass down. &quot;There&#39;s a couple of things,&quot; 
she said, &quot;The first being that... I&#39;m getting a bit too old to operate 
my Hardsuit.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m sure we could modify....&quot; Belldandy started, her light 
brown hair flowing as she moved.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Nene gave her a gentle smile, &quot;but I bet Sylia and 
Skuld would disagree with you.&quot; More seriously, &quot;And to be honest, 
getting shot at while wearing a suit of skintight battle armor doesn&#39;t 
hold the same sort of appeal it once did.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;ll always be a member of the Knight Sabers,&quot; Sylia said 
seriously, &quot;even if you never wear your armor again.&quot;

        &quot;I was hoping you&#39;d say that,&quot; Nene nearly smirked, &quot;because I 
have a replacement in mind.&quot; She looked over at the black haired young 
woman trying to get a smudge of grease off her nose and said, &quot;I 
nominate Skuld.&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t need armor,&quot; Skuld protested reflexedly, &quot;I&#39;m a 
goddess.&quot;

        &quot;Third Class Limited,&quot; Belldandy reminded her of her licensed 
power level gently, getting a glare from her little sister.

        &quot;And I have my bombs,&quot; Skuld frowned.

        Nene crossed the room, surprising the younger woman by putting 
her hand on Skuld&#39;s arm. &quot;I want someone to keep an eye on these 
crazies,&quot; Nene looked over at the goddesses and other Knight Sabers 
fondly, &quot;I&#39;m trusting you to do that.&quot;

        &quot;Playing the &#39;responsibility to my sisters&#39; card was pretty 
low,&quot; Skuld murmured to Nene softly, her eyes narrowed angrily.

        &quot;Maybe,&quot; Nene said quite agreeably, &quot;but did it work?&quot;

        &quot;All right,&quot; Skuld raised her voice to declare, &quot;I&#39;ll be a 
Knight Saber.&quot;

        &quot;You said there was something else?&quot; Linna asked from where she 
was sitting by Belldandy.

        &quot;My hackers over at the AD Police have stumbled onto something 
that might become a Knight Sabers problem,&quot; Nene said.

        Priss leaned forward, &quot;Yes?&quot;

        &quot;Mercenaries,&quot; Nene said seriously, &quot;lots of them. At least 
three major corporations are bringing in combat forces, the sort of 
teams that fought in the fourth Gulf War.&quot;

        &quot;Armored suits, too,&quot; Sylia said thoughtfully, &quot;I intercepted 
information on several shipments coming in to the city.&quot;

        &quot;Combine that with electronic sabotage going on between those 
companies, data raids and litigation,&quot; Nene said grimly, &quot;and you&#39;ve got 
a bomb ready to go off.&quot;</pre>
