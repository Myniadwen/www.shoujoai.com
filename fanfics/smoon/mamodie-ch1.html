<h1>Mamorue Must Die! (part 1 of 35)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#146;s Note- this is the first in what will hopefully be a series of 
omake (a short spoof or parody). You see, it seems like there&#146;s an awful 
lot of people out there who are fans of the Rei/Usagi pairing. Hell, 
just look at the number of fanfics dealing with this pair. 
Unfortunately, there&#146;s a small problem: Mamoru. Yes folks, unfortunately 
tux-boy is always there to ruin this pairing. Therefore, ladies and 
gentleman, Mamoru Must Die!

---Omake One: Little Girl Lost---

The little girl was lost, afraid in the big city. She&#39;d lost her parents 
a while back in the crowded Tokyo streets. With tears running down her 
eyes, she stood at the busy intersection. The light had changed, and she 
was about to be dragged with the crowd further from her folks, when a 
rose flew down from above, landing an her feet.

&quot;A child belongs with her parents, not alone and lost in the streets.&quot; a 
gentle voice said, &quot;Come, I&#39;ll help you.&quot;

The child turned to see a man wearing a long cape over a tuxedo, his 
features hidden by a top hat and mask, and in his hand he held a cane.

She immediately panicked.

&quot;AAAA!&quot; she screamed, &quot;It&#39;s a pimp! He&#39;s trying to steal me away!&quot;

The man looked anxiously around at the now angry adults staring at him, 
&quot;WHAT? Kid, I&#39;m not dressed like this because I&#39;m a pimp! I&#39;m Tuxedo...&quot;

Quickly remembering what she learned in the self-defense for kids class 
at the YWCA her parents sent her to, the child immediately cut the 
stranger off with a swift kick to the groin. As he staggered back in 
agony clutching his crotch, the light changed, and he was killed by a 
head-on collision with a Mack truck.

The next day, Rei went over to a tearful Usagi&#39;s house where her blond 
friend was weeping over a newspaper with the headline, &quot;Hero girl fights 
off Pervert&quot;

&quot;He... He&#39;s gone...&quot; Usagi sobbed, &quot;My Mamo-chan... gone...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s okay.&quot; Rei said as she wrapped her arms around the blond, her 
eyes narrowing ever so softly as a smile teased her lips, &quot;I&#39;m sure I 
can help comfort you...&quot;</pre>
