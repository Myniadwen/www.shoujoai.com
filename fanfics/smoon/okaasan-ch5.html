<h1>Okaa-san? (part 5 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/immeblue.html">Immeblue</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/okaasan-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Ami sat at her computer staring absentmindedly at the screen, while 
Makoto sat on her bed staring intently at her.  After about twenty 
minutes she couldn&#39;t take it anymore &quot;so, aren&#39;t you gonna tell me 
what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Makoto asked her blue haired girlfriend.  It had been 
several days since the confrontation with Yoko and the twosome were 
relaxing in Ami&#39;s room.  Dr. Mizuno was at the hospital and wouldn&#39;t 
be home until late at night.

Ami was shaken out of her daze by Makoto&#39;s sudden outburst, &quot;what did 
you say?&quot;  she asked as she turned around to face the bed. 

Makoto sat up and faced Ami&#39;s direction, &quot;you know you&#39;ve been doing 
that since Yoko was here.&quot;  Makoto couldn&#39;t help it anymore since Yoko 
came and went Ami hasn&#39;t been herself.  She has often caught the 
genius spacing out, yep you read right, spacing out.  Signs of her 
preoccupation were all over the place, book&#39;s left unread on her lap 
while she stared into space, work that took a little longer than usual 
to finish, most surprising of all she even pulled a ditzy Usagi stunt 
and walked into a wall. 

&quot;Sweetheart, I don&#39;t have the faintest idea of what you&#39;re talking 
about?&quot;  

&quot;What?&quot; Makoto was decidedly frustrated she couldn&#39;t believe Ami 
didn&#39;t recognize her own change in behavior. 

&quot;I asked you first Makoto.&quot; Ami laughed, but it was short lived as she 
saw the displease look on Makoto&#39;s face.  Getting up and making her 
way to sit next to makoto on the bed Ami asked &quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;What is it with you?&quot; Makoto asked as Ami settled next to her &quot;almost 
every time I look at you you&#39;re daydreaming.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, its not like I&#39;m thinking of some hunky guy I wanna 
leave you for&quot; Ami joked.

Makoto didn&#39;t laugh, though she was curious she hadn&#39;t really given 
any thought as to what Ami was thinking about when she went off into 
her own world. &quot;So what do you think about then?&quot;

Sobering Ami sighed &quot;I wouldn&#39;t call it daydreaming.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Well, daydreaming makes it sound as if I&#39;m thinking of something 
pleasant.&quot; 

Again Ami developed that faraway look, Makoto couldn&#39;t say whether or 
not she was enjoying her reverie, the stoic look she acquired gave 
nothing away.  Sighing Makoto leaned over to gently shake Ami&#39;s 
shoulder &quot;you&#39;re doing it again.&quot; 

Ami said nothing, her only response was to look solemnly into Mokoto&#39;s 
eyes.

&quot;You still haven&#39;t told me what you think about.&quot;  She took Ami&#39;s hand 
and softly squeezed it &quot;tell me, maybe I can help make them more 
pleasant for you.&quot;
  
&quot;I don&#39;t see how you can&quot; Ami answered thoughtfully as she pulled her 
legs up and hugged them to her body &quot;I keep thinking about Yoko.&quot;   

Makoto waited for her to go on, however when she realized Ami didn&#39;t 
intend to, she prompted &quot;why?&quot;

&quot;Exactly!&quot; Ami exclaimed. &quot;Why did she give me away? My mind keeps 
making up countless different scenarios...I just wish I knew.&quot;

&quot;Oh!&quot; the far off looks made sense to her now, but she didn&#39;t 
understand why Ami didn&#39;t do the obvious.  &quot;So why don&#39;t you ask her?&quot;

Ami gave Makoto a surprised look, she expected her to know, wasn&#39;t it 
obvious &#145;because I can&#39;t stand her,&#39; &quot;because I don&#39;t like her, she&#39;s 
bigoted and obstinate among other things, I shouldn&#39;t have to 
associate with her...and besides the things she said that evening are 
unforgivable&quot; Ami brooded.

&quot;That&#39;s the real reason isn&#39;t it?&quot; Makoto asked as she remembered how 
much the woman had annoyed her too, it took all her control and regard 
for Ami not to blow up at the woman. &quot;The real reason you don&#39;t want 
to see her.&quot;

Ami nodded her agreement, &quot;I just can&#39;t forgive her for that&quot; she 
murmured.

&quot;But you want to know why she gave you up?&quot;  At Ami&#39;s nod she 
continued &quot;I don&#39;t see why you should care.&quot;  Makoto was a bit 
confused at this &quot;you love the mother you have, don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Of course!&quot; Ami was almost appalled &quot;how can you question that?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; Makoto quickly asserted, &quot;I know you do...I don&#39;t know 
what came over me.&quot;  The blush on her face showed her embarrassment.  
&quot;Just why is it such a big deal?&quot;

Ami thought for a moment, &quot;I just want to know about my past, why she 
gave me away?&quot; 

&quot;But...&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know I can ask my mom but she&#39;ll only know so much...I want 
the first hand experience, details.&quot; Ami clarified somberly.

&quot;Then you must go to her,&quot; Makoto started &quot;I don&#39;t see how you can get 
that information without talking to her.&quot; Makoto mused. 

Ami visibly shrunk as she contemplated what Makoto said, &quot;will you 
come with me?&quot;

Both girls knew it wasn&#39;t a question, it was plea that one desperately 
wanted answered.  There was no way Makoto could say no even if she had 
wanted to, &quot;Of course I&#39;ll go with you.&quot;  She hugged Ami thinking that 
Yoko wouldn&#39;t be happy to see her there, but that&#39;s a bridge to cross 
later.
