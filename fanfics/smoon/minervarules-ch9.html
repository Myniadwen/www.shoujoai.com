Lady Jupiter trudged over to where Pluto and Minerva were holding one 
another and crouched down next to the Time Senshi. &quot;Sets-chan.&quot; she 
whispered. Pluto looked up as she wiped her eyes, and the future Senshi 
put her hand on her shoulder, &quot;Sets-chan, I&#39;m sorry to interrupt you and 
Kiho-chan, but we have a very big problem on our hands.&quot;

Sailor Pluto nodded ever so slightly as Kihomi continued to cling to 
her, &quot;I... I know. It&#39;s that scientist, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Yes, it is.&quot; Lady Jupiter answered somberly, &quot;I&#39;m fairly sure you can 
already feel the ripples spreading out from the disruptions caused by 
what she&#39;s revealed. We need to salvage the situation while we can. 
Saeko and I, we need to get back to our time before any more damage to 
either the present or future can occur, then we&#39;ll have to send someone 
else back to erase the memory of Saeko and I having been here, as well 
as anything either of us might&#39;ve revealed about the future.

Pluto nodded and reluctantly turned back to her beloved, &quot;Kiho-chan,&quot; 
she said in a soothing tone, &quot;Kiho-chan, Jupiter and I...&quot;

Minerva met her gaze and nodded, &quot;I know.&quot; she said. She leaned in and 
kissed the Time Senshi on the cheek, &quot;That&#39;s for later.&quot; she said, 
forcing a smile. Pluto stroked her beloved&#39;s cheek before getting up to 
go with the future Senshi.

As Setsuna left with Lady Jupiter, Kihomi felt alone again. She looked 
up at the waning sun and stretched her arms out, trying to soak up every 
last bit of light and warmth from it. She could hear footsteps coming up 
behind her, and knew instinctually it was her friends and fellow Senshi. 
She was about to turn to them, to smile and laugh and hug each and every 
one of them when she heard it.

&quot;Kiho-chan?&quot;

The voice immediately sent a chill down her spine as she pulled her arms 
down and began to shrink inward. She began to shake as fear once again 
gripped at her.

&quot;K... Kiho-chan?&quot; the voice said, &quot;It&#39;s me, obi-san. It&#39;s Hotaru.&quot;

Remembrances of nightmares she&#39;d had as a child of cold murderous hands 
coming from behind to strangle her mingled with the images and 
experiences she&#39;d been through that day. She turned around slowly, 
trying to prepare herself for the worse.

Sailor Saturn was taken aback by Kihomi&#39;s appearance. Her fuku was 
filthy and torn, dirt and grime covered her body and her eyes were 
swollen from crying so much, the tears leaving trails down her grimy 
face where they&#39;d washed away the muck.

Standing behind Saturn was Uranus and Neptune, the latter sensing the 
fear in the teacher. She was about to step forward to pull her adopted 
daughter away until Kihomi was feeling better when the young Senshi took 
a cautious step closer to Kihomi.

&quot;Obi-san,&quot; she began, &quot;I... I know I&#39;m probably the last person you want 
to see right now after... After what my other self... I, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re 
back though, and that you&#39;re safe. If... If you want anything, anything 
at all, I... Even if you want me to stay away from you, I...&quot; her voice 
trailed off as she found herself looking down at the ground and away 
from the teacher&#39;s intense stare. Uranus and Neptune each put a 
consoling hand on the Senshi of Death&#39;s shoulder as she turned to walk 
away.

Minerva watched the three begin to move away. &quot;Hotaru-chan.&quot; she called. 
The child turned around, a hopeful look in her eyes.

&quot;Be... Before you go, could you help me back up to my feet?&quot; the teacher 
asked as she reached toward her with her hand. Saturn came forward and 
took Minerva&#39;s hand. As the teacher finally got to her feet, she 
surprised everyone as she pulled the younger Senshi into a hug.

&quot;Hotaru-chan,&quot; the teacher said as she held her, &quot;God am I glad to see 
you again.&quot; she said smiling as Saturn hugged her back, &quot;That... That 
thing out there wasn&#39;t you, and I could never want you to stay away. 
You&#39;re as much a part of my life now as your Setsuna-mama, mei (niece).&quot;

Hotaru looked up at her with a smile, and Kihomi ruffled her hair a bit 
with her hand.

&quot;Tell you what.&quot; she said as she wiped her eyes again, &quot;I know I&#39;m 
filthy and probably smell pretty ripe right now, but I could really use 
someone to lean on right now. Know any volunteers?&quot;

Saturn didn&#39;t answer, she simply turned and pulled the teacher&#39;s arm 
over her shoulder. The two walked over to Uranus and Neptune as Sailors 
Mercury and Jupiter came over to welcome the Senshi back home.

Meanwhile, Sailor Moon, Lady Jupiter and Pluto met in a grove behind the 
temple where Sailors Venus and Mars were taking care of Hoshi and her 
parents. Sailor Moon, who was always the most intuitive when it came to 
noticing things about those she cared about, could see the fatigue in 
the future Senshi, both in the way her shoulder&#39;s were slumped as well 
as how slowly she moved. The future queen&#39;s eyes then wandered to the 
torn upper arm, the wires sticking out and the fragments of armature 
visible within the shredded metal paneling.

She also found herself noticing how muscular the Senshi from the 
future&#39;s left arm was as she used it to pull a few loose strands of hair 
back behind her left ear as she turned to Pluto.

&quot;Pluto.&quot; Lady Jupiter began, &quot;I... I&#39;m grateful for the help back there, 
but I thought you said it was against the rules for any of your other 
selves to interfere in each other&#39;s timelines.&quot;

&quot;It is.&quot; The Time Senshi answered, &quot;I&#39;m... Not entirely sure how much 
trouble I&#39;m in actually.&quot; she answered candidly.

Sailor Moon spoke up, &quot;So what happens now?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Pluto answered, &quot;First thing&#39;s first. Before we can worry about 
me and what might happen to me, we have to get Saeko and Jupiter here 
back to their time before anything else happens.&quot;

Lady Jupiter nodded gravely, &quot;The technology I used to hypnotize Usagi&#39;s 
parents is roughly the same as Chibi Usa used on her first visit to 
past; unfortunately the device I had was only meant to be used once. 
Probably the easiest solution is to send back Chibi Usa with her Luna-P 
and let her erase everyone&#39;s memories of our visit and what Saeko has 
revealed about the future.&quot;

&quot;But wait a second,&quot; Sailor Moon put in, &quot;Why are you so sure this is a 
bad thing? I mean, what if we were meant to learn this information? Then 
wouldn&#39;t you be mistaken to try to change...&quot; her voice trailed off as 
her eyes widened in surprise. Lady Jupiter noticed the look in the 
princess&#39; eyes and looked down.

The metal of her artificial arm was slowly turning transparent as the 
ghostly outline of a flesh-and-blood arm began to appear.

Lady Jupiter looked at what was happening, her jaw going slack as tears 
began to appear in the corners of her eyes. She&#39;d been without her real 
right arm for so long that she&#39;d forgotten what it was like to look and 
feel normal. She looked at the phantasm of an arm, at the skin, nails, 
blood vessels and muscles showing through, and was lost in the feeling 
of the moment. Could this be a good thing? Maybe, maybe this was all 
that would be changed. No other repercussions, no cosmically horrifying 
ramifications to Saeko&#39;s rantings, just the return of an arm that was 
lost in a tragic accident.

&quot;Jupiter.&quot; Pluto said in a low tone.

Lady Jupiter was no longer listening. She began to think of her wife. 
Lady Mercury had never been able to completely forgive herself for what 
she did to her. Maybe, if she just did nothing...

&quot;Jupiter.&quot; Pluto said more forcefully, &quot;Listen to me; I have a fairly 
good idea of what you&#39;re thinking. This isn&#39;t right, and you know it. 
You lost your arm. It was terrible, I&#39;m sure, but it&#39;s happened. What&#39;s 
been done must not be undone, and if I have to I&#39;ll erase their memories 
myself.&quot;

Lady Jupiter glared at Pluto angrily for a second as Sailor Moon looked 
on anxiously. Finally, the future Senshi closed her eyes as she took a 
deep breath.

&quot;You... You&#39;re right of course, Sets-chan.&quot; she said, looking once again 
at the ghostly form of the arm she was about to loose a second time. 
&quot;Get Saeko.&quot;

A short time later, Sailors Venus and Mars left Hoshi and her parents in 
the shrine as they together brought out the scientist, her hands bound 
in front of her with the Love-Me Chain and her mouth gagged with a 
handkerchief. As the Senshi looked on, Sailor Mercury turned and let out 
a gasp of joy as she saw the now transparent right arm of Lady Jupiter. 
Her joy was quickly extinguished as she saw the look of sadness on her 
future wife&#39;s face.

&quot;Everyone.&quot; Lady Jupiter said as she looked around, &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry for 
all that has happened today. Saeko will be going back into the future 
with me to face judgment, and... And all of your memories of the two of 
us being here will be erased shortly thereafter.&quot;

Sailor Mercury&#39;s eyes widened at that, &quot;But wait. If our memories are 
erased, then...&quot;

Lady Jupiter met her eyes, then looked down at her slowly solidifying 
right arm. She looked back up as a single tear traveled down the future 
Senshi&#39;s right cheek.

Minerva, who was leaning wearily on Saturn, looked at the bound 
scientist in front of her with rage, not just for what she did to her 
but to Setsuna, Hoshi, and the others. Sailor Pluto stepped forward to 
open the timegate.

Sailor Mars seemed to sense the internal struggle within the future 
Senshi, and let go of the scientist for a second in order to go over to 
comfort her. It was all the opening Saeko needed. She swung her bound 
hands up, clipping Venus in the side of the face. As the Senshi of Love 
staggered back, she pulled the gag out of her mouth, looking angrily at 
Sailor Moon.

&quot;Cunt!&quot; she screamed, &quot;Whore! Fuck you, Serenity! Fuck you, fuck Crystal 
Tokyo, your matriarchy, your royal court, your bitch daughter, and all 
your hopes and dreams! Fuck Endymion, but most of all fuck you!&quot;

Lady Jupiter, though physically spent from the events of the day, rushed 
the scientist, her teeth gritted as she reached out for her, &quot;That&#39;s 
enough, damn it!&quot; she yelled, &quot;We&#39;re going back to...&quot; she was cut off 
as Saeko kicked her as hard as she could in the shin, sending her to the 
ground.

&quot;No!&quot; she yelled, &quot;I won&#39;t go! I won&#39;t!&quot;

Sailor Saturn, closest to the scientist, pulled away from Minerva as she 
now rushed forward along with Mars and Uranus. Sailor Minerva watched as 
Saturn reached her first.

&quot;How dare you?&quot; the girl asked as she tried to grab her, &quot;Sailor Moon 
is...&quot;

The scientist cut her off by spitting in her face, &quot;Fucking freak!&quot; she 
screamed as she swung up with her arms, hitting the youngest Senshi in 
the chin.

Minerva&#39;s eyes widened and her face became red with anger. &quot;You bitch!&quot; 
she shrieked. It was her fault; Saeko&#39;s. She was the one who sent her 
and an innocent little girl into the darkness, and who caused her and 
Setsuna so much pain. It was all her fault, and now she had the nerve to 
hurt Hotaru?

She was going to pay.

She rushed at the scientist, pushing the equally furious Mars and Uranus 
out of the way with a strength she didn&#39;t have only a moment ago. Her 
hands gripped at Saeko&#39;s throat as they both tumbled into the timegate. 
She could hear Lady Jupiter follow her in as the scenery around her 
changed. She found herself on top of Saeko with her hands still wrapped 
around her neck, a polished marble floor underneath them. She became 
dimly aware of voices and movement around her, but didn&#39;t care as all 
her attention focused on the woman under her and the neck she was 
squeezing.

&quot;Kiho-chan!&quot; Lady Jupiter yelled as she tumbled weakly from the 
timegate; her red eyes, ghostly arm and disheveled appearance causing 
almost as many gasps as Minerva&#39;s behavior. She sank to her knees, 
unable to walk because of the injury to her shin and too exhausted even 
for a Jupiter Low Shock. She crawled over and grabbing at the War 
Senshi&#39;s left arm weakly, &quot;Don&#39;t do this, please!&quot; she begged.

Minerva ignored her as she watched Saeko&#39;s eyes start to bulge and her 
face turn blue. &quot;You bitch!&quot; she screamed as footsteps rapidly came up 
behind her, Do you have any idea what you did to me? Or Setsuna? You...&quot;

The now crazed Senshi was cut off as someone grabbed her around the 
waist from behind and bodily pulled her off the now unconscious 
scientist. As Minerva thrashed around trying to struggle, she found 
herself slammed up against a wall in a full nelson while the palace 
guards took the now unconscious Saeko into custody and to the infirmary. 
As Minerva continued to struggle angrily against her captor, the person 
pushed her harder against the wall as a pair of lips came up next to her 
ear.

&quot;Kiho-chan,&quot; the voice said in a surprisingly gentle tone given the 
circumstances, &quot;It&#39;s okay; it&#39;s over. She can&#39;t hurt you or anyone else 
you love anymore. You&#39;re safe, everyone&#39;s safe. I know you&#39;re angry and 
hurt, but it&#39;s over now. It&#39;s over.&quot;

Minerva finally stopped struggling as she began to relax her muscles, 
her captor likewise relaxing her grip. Minerva turned around and allowed 
a soft gasp to escape her as she looked into a very familiar pair of 
grey eyes.

Her jaw went slack; it was her. Her future self, looking back at her. 
She suddenly began to feel lightheaded as whatever it was that gave her 
so much strength only moments ago began to leave her.

Lady Minerva steadied her past self. &quot;First thing&#39;s first.&quot; she said, 
&quot;I&#39;d say you used up the last bit of strength and adrenalin you had just 
now when you lost it and attacked Saeko. Your sudden dizziness should 
leave you shortly. Secondly,&quot; she said with a smile as she moved away 
from her, &quot;Welcome to Crystal Tokyo.&quot;

As her future self moved out of the way, Minerva looked around at a 
sumptuous throne room. A group of familiar looking faces looked at her 
dirty form with concern as Lady Mercury ran to her wife kneeling on the 
floor. They looked like the Senshi Minerva knew, but different somehow; 
more beautiful, as if they glowed with an inner light.

Or reflected the light of another.

Minerva felt her breath catch in her throat as an angel seemed to float 
towards her, beautiful beyond words and a look of unconditional love and 
understanding in her face. A pair of magnificent cream-white wings 
spread out behind her, and her golden hair hung down her sides from a 
pair of odangos.

Before she knew what she was doing, Sailor Minerva knelt down on one 
knee before the heavenly creature standing before her. She didn&#39;t even 
understand why; it just seemed the proper thing to do when coming face 
to face with a goddess. Her jaw hung open and her eyes stared 
unblinkingly at the figure coming towards her in her flowing white gown. 
As Lady Jupiter talked hurriedly with Ladies Mercury and Pluto, Lady 
Minerva squatted down next to her past self.

&quot;Kihomi,&quot; she said with a smile, &quot;Let me introduce you to Her Majesty, 
Neo Queen Serenity.&quot;

Minerva turned to her future self with a surprised look in her eyes, 
&quot;Serenity?&quot; she asked, &quot;Then... Then she&#39;s...&quot; she turned back to the 
vision of splendor in front of her, &quot;Usagi-chan?&quot;

The queen smiled down on her as she bent down to take the stunned 
Senshi&#39;s hands, &quot;It&#39;s been many years since I&#39;ve been called that.&quot; she 
said as she helped Minerva back up to her feet. As Sailor Minerva 
watched, her future wife Lady Pluto came forward and began to whisper in 
Neo Queen Serenity&#39;s ear. As she looked on, she saw telltale signs that 
told her Pluto had been crying only a short time ago. Looking around, 
she saw it on the others too, on Lady Venus, Lady Neptune, and even 
surprisingly enough on Uranus&#39; face. She began to become concerned when 
she felt her future self&#39;s hand on her shoulder.

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; she whispered, &quot;There was a bit of trouble earlier before 
you got here. It&#39;s over now.&quot;

Before Minerva could ask what she meant, the queen and Lady Pluto came 
over.

&quot;Kiho-chan,&quot; the queen began, &quot;I wish you could stay longer, but 
unfortunately it&#39;s time to end your visit.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s time to return to your time.&quot; Lady Pluto added, &quot;We also need to 
erase any memory of Saeko and Lady Jupiter having visited your time. The 
young princess Usagi II will accompany you with the Luna-P to...&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Lady Minerva interrupted, &quot;That can&#39;t happen. The princess must 
stay here, and she must go back alone with the Luna-P.&quot;

Both Pluto and the queen looked confused.

&quot;But why?&quot; Neo Queen Serenity asked, &quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot;

&quot;Because,&quot; Lady Minerva answered, &quot;That&#39;s what happened last time.&quot;

A silence suddenly hung over the hall.

&quot;You... You knew?&quot; Lady Pluto asked, &quot;You knew all this...&quot;

Lady Minerva shook her head, &quot;Not everything. Keep in mind love, I was 
in an alternate universe for most of it. I knew Jupiter would eventually 
end up with an artificial arm and that I would come from the past to 
visit my present self, but other than that...&quot;

Sailor Minerva looked confused, &quot;Wait a second, I don&#39;t understand any 
of this. What are you talking about?&quot;

As if in answer to her question, a young lady with pink hair came 
forward, followed by a black ball-shaped object with a cat&#39;s face, &quot;Take 
this back to your time period,&quot; she began, &quot;Then push this button and 
tell everyone to forget about Lady Jupiter and Saeko. The ball will do 
the rest.&quot;

Lady Pluto opened the timegate, &quot;Go.&quot; she said as she stroked Sailor 
Minerva&#39;s cheek affectionately, &quot;I&#39;ll keep the gate opened. When you&#39;re 
done, just send the Luna-P back into it.&quot;

Sailor Minerva put her own hand over Lady Pluto&#39;s, bringing it over and 
kissing the back of it. She then entered the gate with the Luna-P, 
suddenly finding herself in front of Sailor Saturn who was rubbing her 
sore chin as Neptune wiped the spittle from her face.

&quot;Obi-san.&quot; Saturn exclaimed, &quot;What...&quot;

&quot;Is... Is everyone here?&quot; Minerva asked. The others looked around as 
Hoshi and her grateful parents came over. Sailor Moon spoke up.

&quot;Yeah, everyone&#39;s here.&quot; she answered, &quot;But why do you have Chibi Usa&#39;s 
Luna-P?&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot; Minerva said as she held the ball in front of her, &quot;Everyone 
gather around, I have something to share with you...&quot;

---One Hour Later---

Kihomi erased everyone&#39;s memory of Lady Jupiter and Saeko, but left 
behind the fact that she and Hoshi had dealt with Mistress Nine in an 
alternate reality. She also allowed them to remember that Jupiter saved 
them, but not that it was the future Jupiter. She found herself 
chuckling as Mako-chan found herself the center of attention with 
everyone hugging her and Hotaru telling her she was her new favorite 
Inner, which of course set Usagi and Minako off.

She&#39;d spent the last half hour showering, the water turned up as hot as 
she could stand it. She was trying to clean the dirt and dust of the 
foul place she&#39;d just been to off of herself, trying to let the water 
wash away the images she&#39;d seen and the anxieties she&#39;d suffered. Every 
time she closed her eyes though she saw it again; the dark. The bodies. 
The ruins. The statue. She had to keep opening her eyes, keep reminding 
herself she was safe. She looked at her hands, noticing how her 
fingertips were all pruned.

She turned the overhead shower off and grabbed a towel.

------

Setsuna walked into her bedroom wearing an off-white blouse and green 
skirt. As she closed the door, she leaned her back up against it 
wearily. From what she&#39;d been able to gather from the girl and Kihomi 
herself, the place they&#39;d come from sounded like hell on earth. Her love 
was in the shower at the moment, trying to wash the grime of the place 
off. She knew Kihomi had been through a traumatic experience and was 
badly shaken, and she wanted to do everything in her power to help her 
through the healing process.

She was snapped out of her worries for her beloved by a disturbance in 
time. Turning around, she saw a timegate suddenly appear in the room. 
Setsuna began to tense up; she&#39;d broken the rules, she&#39;d called out to 
the other Plutos. Apparently, it was time for her to pay for her 
transgressions.

The Time Senshi exited the portal into Setsuna&#39;s room, her large feline 
ears stood up at attention when she noticed the sad and worried look on 
the woman&#39;s face. Setsuna went over to her, her head bent low.

&quot;This... This is about asking all of you for help, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

The Pluto in front of her nodded, her dark green tail draped over the 
arm holding the Time Staff, &quot;Yes, I&#39;m afraid so.&quot; she answered, &quot;It was 
left up to all of us to choose your punishment, and I was designated to 
carry it out.&quot;

Setsuna began to shake, &quot;I... I see, I...&quot;

&quot;Hold out your right hand.&quot; the Pluto from another world ordered. 
Setsuna reluctantly complied, expecting the worse. The other Time Senshi 
reached out, and smacked the back of her hand, causing a small yelp of 
pain to escape Setsuna&#39;s lips. The stunned woman looked over to her 
catlike self with a bewildered look on her face.

&quot;Wha... What was that?&quot; she asked in shock. The other Pluto smiled back 
with a twinkle in her eyes.

&quot;A slap on the wrist.&quot; she answered with a wink. At the look Setsuna was 
giving her, she put her hand on her arm, &quot;Relax. Technically speaking, 
all of us broke the rules as well by answering your request for help. 
Besides,&quot; she added, &quot;It was for Minerva, after all. I think I speak for 
everyone when I say any one of us would&#39;ve done the same for our mates.&quot;

Setsuna didn&#39;t know what to say. She went over and hugged her other 
self, hearing a purring noise escape from the other Pluto in response. 
As they parted, her other self smiled at her.

&quot;You know,&quot; she began, &quot;We&#39;re forbidden from interfering in each other&#39;s 
timelines. That doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t play cards or exchange photos of 
our friends once in a while.&quot; she said as the timegate opened behind her 
and she disappeared into it. Setsuna stared at the space her other self 
had just left as a smile came over her.

&quot;I think I might&#39;ve started something.&quot; she murmured as the doorknob 
began to turn. As she watched, Kihomi warily trudged in wearing a light 
blue bathrobe and a towel draped over her hair, covering her features. 
She reached up and pulled the towel off, smiling as she saw Setsuna.

&quot;So.&quot; the Time Senshi said as she smiled back, &quot;Now that you&#39;re back, 
what do you feel like doing?&quot;

Kihomi smiled wickedly as she draped her arms around her love, &quot;I&#39;m a 
bit tired to do what I feel like doing now that we&#39;re together again.&quot; 
she quipped, &quot;If you don&#39;t mind, what I could really use is some rest.&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot; Setsuna said as she led them both over to the bed. As the 
teacher lay down on her side, her lover lay next to her, pulling her in 
tight and spooning the two of them together. Kihomi turned her head and 
pressed her lips to Setsuna&#39;s. Their lips parted as their tongues met, 
each woman loosing herself in the moment. Finally, they broke the kiss, 
and Kihomi closed her eyes as she settled into Setsuna&#39;s embrace.

&quot;I love you.&quot; the teacher whispered.

&quot;I love you too.&quot; Setsuna answered. Moments later, Kihomi fell asleep in 
her love&#39;s arms.
