She took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and allowed the memories to 
flood back.

--

&quot;My Queen,&quot; she had said, her dark eyes looking intently into the 
blonde&#39;s baby-blue ones.

&quot;Mars,&quot; Neo Queen Serenity said as she smiled at her friend, &quot;We&#39;ve 
known each other far too long to be so formal. What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;I... Promise me first that, no matter what I say, that we&#39;ll remain 
friends.&quot;

&quot;You know me better than that.&quot; The Queen answered, &quot;Now what is it?&quot;

&quot;Serenity, I... I love you. I mean, I&#39;m in love with you, and...&quot; she 
was cut off as Serenity placed her fingers up to her lips.

&quot;No.&quot; she said sadly, &quot;Don&#39;t say it, don&#39;t even think it. I... I love 
you too. But I&#39;m married to Endymion. Fate has bound me to him, and ours 
is a love that can never be.&quot;

--

Neo Queen Serenity opened her eyes again. She&#39;d been daydreaming again 
of that fateful day not so long ago. As she turned to her left she sadly 
regarded her husband sitting upon his throne. Damn fate; why couldn&#39;t 
she be with the one she longed for? She turned away from him to look out 
at the Senshi gathered in the royal chambers. Everyone was present 
except for Mars and Pluto.

Suddenly, a red warning light began to flash. As the Senshi gathered 
looked around in confusion, the Queen stood up from her throne to face 
the person currently running down the corridor to the room.

&quot;Neo Queen Serenity!&quot; Pluto shouted as she ran into the royal court, &quot;My 
queen, we&#39;re in trouble!&quot;

&quot;Trouble?&quot; the Queen asked, &quot;Exactly what sort or trouble?&quot;

Neptune and Uranus were both silently staring at Pluto. They&#39;d been with 
her long enough throughout the centuries and countless lifetimes between 
them to know how rare it was to see their best friend frightened. The 
others likewise felt unease at seeing the Time Senshi panicked.

&quot;My Queen, it&#39;s pirates. Space pirates have been spotted by our early 
warning systems entering the solar system.&quot;

&quot;Space pirates?&quot; Venus asked. Jupiter looked grimly from Pluto to the 
Queen.

&quot;Well,&quot; Jupiter began, &quot;It&#39;s been awhile since our Sailor Senshi days, 
but I&#39;m up for a fight!&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot; Uranus nodded in agreement, &quot;Let them come, we&#39;ll...&quot;

&quot;Just one moment.&quot; Neo Queen Serenity interrupted, &quot;Before anyone does 
anything, do we have a visual of the pirate ships?&quot;

&quot;Indeed my Queen.&quot; Pluto said as she turned on a large screen in the 
royal chamber. There were two large ships, one looking almost cigar 
shaped while the other was designed to look more like a 
seventeenth-century galley.

Serenity turned from the screen to the resident genius of the royal 
court, &quot;Mercury, use your super computer and see if you can identify 
those ships.&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot; Mercury said as she pulled her mini computer out and began 
searching through the databases. As the tension in the room began to 
rise, King Endymion rose from his throne and left the room just as the 
royal High Priestess of the court temple Mars entered the room.

&quot;My Queen,&quot; she said, &quot;I was sitting before the sacred flames when I 
suddenly felt something was wrong, what...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got a positive identification on the ships.&quot; Mercury interrupted, 
&quot;They&#39;re the Queen Emeraldas, flagship of the female pirate Emeraldas, 
and the Arcadia, flagship of Captain Harlock.&quot;

Neo Queen Serenity surprised everyone by breathing a sigh of relief.

&quot;Thank goodness.&quot; the blonde said. Her daughter Chibi Usa looked at her 
in surprise.

&quot;Mom?&quot; the child asked, &quot;What&#39;s going on? They&#39;re pirates, aren&#39;t they?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; the Queen explained, &quot;But they were forced into becoming pirates 
to defend the earth from enemies in outer space. They&#39;re on our side.&quot;

As the implications of what Serenity just revealed slowly set in, the 
large screen with the images of the two ships began to go fuzzy.

&quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot; Saturn asked.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Mercury said, &quot;But I believe we&#39;re being hailed.&quot;

Suddenly, a man in a long flowing cape appeared on screen, standing with 
a glass of wine in his hand. His long brown bangs hung over the eye 
patch on his right eye, and a nasty looking scar was visible under his 
left eye. The pirate&#39;s infamous laser-rapier, a weapon shaped like an 
old-fashioned sword, hung from his hip. He stared intensely out of his 
good eye at the Queen and her court.

&quot;Neo-Queen Serenity,&quot; he said with a slight smile, &quot;It&#39;s been awhile.&quot;

&quot;Indeed it has.&quot; the Queen answered, &quot;And how goes the war with the 
Illumidas?&quot;

A second image appeared on the large screen. This time of a beautiful 
yet grave-looking female pirate, her face likewise scarred in battle.

&quot;That is why we&#39;re here.&quot; the female pirate Emeraldas answered, &quot;Our 
supplies have been drained in a confrontation with the Illumidas, and we 
require food and fuel.&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot; The Queen answered graciously, &quot;We&#39;d be more than happy 
to...&quot; she was cut off as King Endymion raced back into the royal 
chamber. &quot;Endymion?&quot; the Queen asked, &quot;What...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot; King Endymion said with a smile, &quot;I&#39;ve just saved the 
kingdom.&quot;

As Captain Harlock and Emeraldas observed from the large screen, the 
Senshi looked at the King, then at each other, then at the King again.

&quot;You what?&quot; Neptune asked.

&quot;Endymion,&quot; Neo Queen Serenity said, &quot;There were no evil space pirates, 
it was Captain Harlock and Emeraldas that we detected.&quot; she said 
pointing to the screen, &quot;Now exactly what did you mean when you said you 
saved the kingdom?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Endymion said, &quot;I just got off the phone with the World Welfare 
Works Association, or WWWA. I explained our situation, and they said 
they&#39;d send over a pair of troubleshooters to help out.&quot;

&quot;Oh no...&quot; Venus gasped.

&quot;The 3WA?&quot; Neptune asked as she felt a sinking feeling in the pit of her 
stomach.

&quot;You didn&#39;t...&quot; Mercury said, her voice shaking with fear.

&quot;Um... Endymion dear,&quot; Neo Queen Serenity asked as her right eye began 
to twitch, &quot;You didn&#39;t happen to get the name of the two agents the 3WA 
was sending over, did you?&quot;

&quot;Of course I did.&quot; Endymion said, &quot;They&#39;re names are Kei and Yuri, but 
they&#39;re collectively known as &#39;the Lovely Angels&#39;.&quot;

The Senshi all stared wide-eyed at the King. Finally, after several 
seconds, Uranus broke the silence.

&quot;The Dirty Pair?&quot; the Senshi of the winds asked, not quite believing 
what she was hearing, &quot;You had them send the Dirty Pair to fight Captain 
Harlock and Emeraldas?&quot;

------

From his station on the Arcadia, Captain Harlock&#39;s eye narrowed 
dangerously as he frowned at the screen. He never could figure out what 
Neo Queen Serenity saw in that idiot she was married to. He wasn&#39;t sure 
who or what this &quot;Dirty Pair&quot; was, but from the reaction of the rest of 
the royal court who were currently cursing out King Endymion, he guessed 
that the upcoming conflict would not be good.

--

As Emeraldas and her flagship neared Earth&#39;s orbit, she saw a small 
warship on her scanners flying erratically toward her and Captain 
Harlock. As it maneuvered its way in front of the Arcadia and the Queen 
Emeraldas, it knocked into a satellite and sent it on a collision course 
with Earth.

&quot;Viewscreen.&quot; Emeraldas ordered, at which pint a crew member immediately 
turned the screen on.

After a few seconds of fuzziness, an image appeared on the screen.

&quot;Yuri, you idiot!&quot; a young redhead in a skimpy uniform shouted, &quot;Can&#39;t 
you do anything without causing damage?&quot;

&quot;It was just a small satellite,&quot; an equally young-looking Japanese woman 
in a similarly skimpy-looking outfit answered, &quot;And look who&#39;s talking 
Kei! I wasn&#39;t the one who accidentally blew up that asteroid colony in 
the Beta quadrant!&quot;

&quot;Um, ladies.&quot; Emeraldas said, at which point both women turned to face 
the screen.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Yuri asked. Suddenly she smiled. &quot;Oh hi.&quot; she said, waving 
cheerfully at the screen as a large cat-like animal came into the scene 
in the background, &quot;Don&#39;t mind us, we&#39;re on the lookout for some 
dangerous space pirates. Say, I love your hair. Who do you go to? 
Myself, I...&quot;

&quot;You moron!&quot; Kei shouted as she pointed at the screen, &quot;She is a space 
pirate!&quot;

&quot;Oops.&quot; Yuri said. As Kei turned to the view screen to face Emeraldas, 
Yuri started to back away. She unfortunately tripped over the large 
cat-like pet the women shared and went careening backwards into the 
control console, at which point her elbow hit a button that launched a 
missile at a retirement home under construction on the moon.

As Yuri quickly tried to put herself in front of the computer monitor so 
that her redheaded companion wouldn&#39;t see her screw-up, Kei addressed 
Emeraldas.

&quot;In the name of the 3WA,&quot; the redhead declared, &quot;We&#39;re taking you in, 
and...&quot;

Suddenly, Captain Harlock&#39;s face appeared on the screen, &quot;Ladies,&quot; he 
said grimly, &quot;Before this goes any further, I believe there&#39;s been a 
mix-up.&quot;

------

&quot;Hello?&quot; Neo Queen Serenity said as she held the phone to her ear, &quot;3WA? 
Whom am I speaking to? Gooley? Ah, good. Gooley-sama, my baka of a 
husband, King Endymion, accidentally asked you to send us help, and... 
Yes, they did send the Lovely Angels. What? No, so far no cities have 
been destroyed as yet, but we did loose a lovely retirement center that 
was being built near some ancestral ruins of mine on the moon. That&#39;s 
why I&#39;m calling. We don&#39;t need your services after all. Oh, thank you so 
much. Good-bye.&quot; she said as she hung up the phone.

&quot;Well?&quot; Mars asked for everyone present.

&quot;Everything&#39;s been taken care of.&quot; the Queen said as she smiled in 
relief, &quot;The Dirty Pair have been recalled. And as for you...&quot; she said 
sternly as she looked at King Endymion.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot; Endymion said, &quot;I&#39;ve learned my lesson, I...&quot; the King&#39;s 
voice died out as he and the others heard a sharp whistling sound coming 
from outside the palace. The King was just about to ask what it was, 
when the burnt remains of the satellite Yuri knocked out of orbit 
crashed through the palace roof and landed on Endymion, killing him 
instantly.

---Later---

&quot;Thank you again for the supplies.&quot; Captain Harlock said as he bowed to 
Neo Queen Serenity. As he left the royal chamber to return to the 
Arcadia, two rather sheepish-looking young women stood before the 
Senshi.

&quot;Um, we&#39;re really sorry about killing you King and blowing up the moon 
base and everything.&quot; Yuri said.

&quot;If it helps any, this is actually the least amount of carnage we&#39;ve 
ever caused on a mission.&quot; Kei added.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t help.&quot; Mars said angrily, &quot;King Endymion is dead and...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; the Queen interrupted from behind, &quot;The 3WA has promised to 
take care of everything. You two may leave now, and please take care.&quot;

As the two left the royal chamber, the Queen turned to her fellow 
Senshi.

&quot;You may all leave now, except for Mars.&quot; she stated.

Mars watched her fellow Senshi leave the room. As she saw Uranus leave, 
she could&#39;ve sworn she saw the sandy-blonde wink at her. Now that she 
was alone at last, she heard Neo Queen Serenity&#39;s voice from behind her.

&quot;Mars,&quot; the Queen asked in a voice trembling with emotion, &quot;When we 
talked together a while back, do... Do you still love me?&quot;

Mars felt her heart flutter at the question. She&#39;d waited for her Queen 
and friend for so long, that she&#39;d almost given up hope.

&quot;Yes, my Queen.&quot; Mars answered, &quot;With all my heart.&quot;

No sooner were the words out than she felt Serenity&#39;s arm encircle her 
from behind, pulling her into the blonde&#39;s embrace. Her eyes closed as 
she felt the woman she&#39;d loved for so long breathing gently on her neck.

&quot;And I,&quot; the Queen whispered as she traced the raven-haired Senshi&#39;s jaw 
line with her finger, &quot;I still love you.&quot;

&quot;M... My Queen, I...&quot; Mars was cut off as Neo Queen Serenity turned her 
around and pulled her into a long, passionate kiss.

---To Be Continued---

End Notes: Kei and Yuri are of course from The Dirty Pair, and Captain 
Harlock and Emeraldas are in a series of animes based on the works of 
Leiji Matsumoto.</pre>
