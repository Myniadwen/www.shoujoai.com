<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Server banks lined the floor as far as the eye could see.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Green  and red lights blinked irregularly, creating a universe of stop and go  stars. The white noise of thousands of cooling fans was a constant hum  that could be felt in one’s feet. The gentle breeze that was  artificially pumped through the massive space was goosebump inducing,  and the tall brunette held her arms to her chest gingerly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s creepy in here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  Eternity Main System is hardly anything to be afraid of.” Her blue  haired companion said with an airy chuckle, even as her eyes were held  captive to the translucent readout before her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto stomped ten  feet from Ami, turned, and paced back again. “Still, this is no place  for me. I should be on Mercury, with Venus and Rei-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami tore  her eyes from her data and swiveled in her chair. She caught the Jovian  by the wrist as she paced past. “Mako-chan, you know you don’t have to  fight to be useful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A blush dusted Makoto’s cheeks and her hazel  eyes darted to the floor, yet a small smile teased the corner of her  mouth. Ami had taught her this lesson on several occasions, but it was  one the tomboy was still learning to accept.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Besides,” Ami said, “I think this is something Mina-chan and Rei-san have to figure out on their own.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you’re not talking about the mission anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blunette raised a suggestive eyebrow. “I have <em>no</em> idea what you’re talking about.” She spun back to her workstation  before her best friend could give her a case of the giggles. “Now, you  need to go. Serenity-chan will be expecting you shortly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Jovian glanced down at her chronometer and nodded. Their Princess would  be wrapping up her tutoring session soon. She laid a hand on the  smaller woman’s shoulder. “I’ll bring you something sweet after my  guard shift ends.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami looked back over her shoulder. “Why not now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I don’t have-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami grabbed Makoto by her collar and pulled the other woman towards her for upside down kiss.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’ll do.” She said cheerfully before she retuned her attention back to her readout.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
She could barely breathe.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mercury’s atmosphere was notoriously thin, and the solar winds that  sheared at the nearly non-existent stratospheres of the poles only made  oxygen that much harder to come by.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You should transform.” Rei said sharply, her words short and clipped to conserve her breath.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s the skirt, isn’t it? I bet it gets you every time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I… what!?” The Priestess looked back over her shoulder where Minako laughed shallowly and then choked from the effort.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Serves you right.” Rei barked. “I only thought it would make it easier for you to breathe in that form.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The leader of the senshi touched a finger to her chin. “It probably would.” She admitted. “But you don’t have that advantage.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s eyes narrowed. “So?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako opened her mouth to respond but was cut off by the chronometer communicators strapped to both hers and Rei’s wrists.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ami to Venus.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minako here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Martian’s brows met and she gestured to the Venusian. “See? Even the  brains of this operation thinks you should transform.” She hissed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako snorted. “I <em>am</em> the brains of this operation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei sighed. “We’re officially doomed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The leader of the senshi smiled cheerfully and pushed the Priestess forward as Ami spoke.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  transport circuit that brought you just left should only be a few hours  walk from the technical point of the pole. It shouldn’t be a long  journey.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ch’. If only Jupiter had been that easy.” Rei mumbled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  frowned. She wouldn’t have had Jupiter any other way, but then, the  Martian seemed to be known for her bravado and careless attitude and  she decided not to dwell on it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The air was eerily still and  quiet. The women’s boots crunched on loose gravel and the splintering  cracks of thin sheets of ice elicited chilling shockwaves that sounded  like nails on a chalkboard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s boot crunched an empty hole in the ice. “It’s freezing here, but the ice is so thin.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  the sun’s proximity is so close, its intensity keeps perma-ice from  forming, even though it is very cold. The further north you travel, the  thicker the ice will get.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami’s text book explanation was  obvious, both women could feel the intensity of the sun; its heat was a  direct contrast to the cold temperatures, and gave a result of feeling  both icily cold and stifling warm at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After awhile, Minako shuddered. The silence became too much to bear. “You’re missing a very eerie landscape, Ami-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I envy that you’re witnessing first hand what I’ve seen only in pictures.” The Mercurian admitted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Gotten over your fear of poles, Ami-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako was met with silence. Apparently not, then.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Ami had gone silent. Through her companions, she was absorbing data from her planet’s pole.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hours passed slowly. The sun, never more than a looming, orange half  circle that hugged the cratered horizon, had set and risen once already  due to the planet’s short day span, and Minako and Rei had ventured  into harsher territory where the colder climate saw less of the sun’s  effects.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ch’.” It was a simple curse, but she’d tired of  mumbling longer ones as falling onto her rear end became a more  frequent endeavor. The Martian Priestess rubbed her backside tenderly.  She’s take snow over ice any day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Never one to miss an opportunity, Minako took advantage of the situation. “You know, you have terrible balance for a savage.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please.” Rei groaned. “I’ve picked your ass up off the ground twice as often as I’ve fallen.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve barely fallen at all. You exaggerate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You underestimate, <em>Princess</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, so you took my words to heart last night, ne?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Considering how much you drank, I’m surprised you even <em>remembered</em> your words from last night.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  scrambled to her knees and prepared to rise when a hand was thrust into  her face. She smirked at the Venusian and took the proffered hand to be  aided to her feet. And there they stood before each other, unsure if  their shallow breaths and quickened heartbeats were solely attributed  to the thin atmosphere anymore.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They were throwing verbal barbs  one minute and holding hands the next, but Rei found herself guessing  that the Venusian’s actions were more telling than her words. She could  be so gentle one moment, yet harsh the next, but was that really any  different than herself?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Under the Martian’s scrutinizing gaze, the Venusian’s eyes darted away and she wrenched her hand out of Rei’s grasp quickly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minako?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t want to siphon your energy.” The Venusian said causally, remembering that that she really <em>had</em> chosen to bring Rei with her for reasons that weren’t entirely selfish. With her nose to the air, she began walking away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Priestess forged forward and grabbed Minako’s hand. “It’ll be okay. We’re getting close now, anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian’s gaze trailed to where their hands were joined. “But…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The dark energy is strong here,” Rei said awkwardly, “and there’s lots of it, and…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Cerulean eyes looked hopeful. “And?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I don’t <em>like</em> the youma. It makes them much easier to track…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s  words died a slow death on her tongue. When last she’d used her sensing  abilities, she’d feared for Minako’s safety. Her feelings for the other  woman were a jumbled mess. There were a million other reasons why it  had drained her so quickly. Rei had only settled on the safest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” Minako asked, and suddenly, her teasing, flirtatious nature had returned. She waggled her eyebrows suggestively. “Then, <em>do</em> you like – ah!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei sighed and helped the other woman up off the ground, but she kept a firm hand around Minako’s own as she advanced once more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Having  been robbed of the moment, the Venusian was irked and had begun to pout  when she felt the first twinges of what Rei sensed through the link  they shared. The pout faded from her lips. Her brows furrowed. She  found herself biting her lower lip. The darkness that permeated the  auras that Rei tracked was nearly incapacitating. Glancing at the other  woman, who forged forward despite being bombarded by the same darkness,  she steeled herself, for the unpleasantness of the auras they tracked  was preferable to the alternative of not walking hand in hand with the  Martian.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know,” Minako began, eager for any amount of small  talk to distract herself from the unpleasantness, “I have an innate  ability like your ability to track auras.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hn?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can’t read minds or anything, but I am empathic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Empathic?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can sense strong emotions from others; sadness, loneliness, excitement, but especially love.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Love?” Rei’s frown was indicative of a deep mistrust of the word.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it <em>is</em> the ruling power of my planet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course it is.” Rei said dryly, but her clipped words seemed to put off  the Venusian. She was unused to all this... speaking openly. But she  wanted to try. “Tell me more.” She said hesitantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, Ami-chan and Mako-chan, for example.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even I figured <em>that</em> one out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine  then.” Minako stuck her nose to the air again. “Well then, you haven’t  met him yet, and they haven’t seen each other in awhile, but Prince  Endymion and Serenity-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s eyes narrowed. “Ah.” She said, slowing her pace.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Un. That’s makes this whole situation with the Earth that much more difficult.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, what about you, then?” Rei asked over her shoulder, not so offhandedly</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What <em>about</em> me?” Minako asked dumbly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  titled her head at her and the Venusian blushed faintly. “Oh! Oh. I’ve…  I’ve never been able to get a reading on myself, strangely enough.”  Minako stopped walking all together, and when Rei was met with  resistance, she too stopped and looked at the other woman over her  shoulder in question.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The slightly smaller woman claimed the space that had formed between them. “And for some reason, I can’t seem to read <em>you</em>, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Suddenly,  their communicators crackled, and both women physically flinched. “Why  have you two stopped? Is everything all right? The technical point of  the pole is very close now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Great timing, Ami-chan.’ </em>Minako growled to herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  pointed to the distance where the ragged edge of a massive crater gave  way to a sharp blackness beyond. Minako nodded, and the two women  headed in that direction with renewed determination.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Chao-Meng-Fu Crater.” Ami whispered. “An impact crater that is one hundred and ten miles wide. Could they be hiding there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei nodded with no amount of doubt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We seem to think so, Ami-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two women sidled up to the crater’s edge, laying their bodies flat against the rise to avoid detection.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s… too dark to see.” Rei whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  angle of the sun doesn’t allow any light into the crater’s depths.” Ami  said. “I was prepared for this. Switch your communicators to infrared  display. My visor will pick up what your communicators see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  women toggled through several settings on their chronometers and blue  shield like apparatuses, similar to the one Mercury possessed in her  senshi form, flashed before their eyes. The Martian was a little taken  aback by the technology and took some time adjusting to the false color  display. At first, they thought something was wrong with the equipment,  as all they could see was a pulsing, undulating mass of reds and  yellows. But then…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ami-chan, is there-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. Nothing’s  wrong with the equipment. There really are just that many youma down  there. Tens of thousands.” She whispered. “At least.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei could  feel Minako shiver next to her body and fought the urge to do so  herself. Regaining her calm composure, her eyes continued to scan the  crater. “There,” she finally said, “in the center of the crater,  coordinates J3, 1T.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just like on Mars and Jupiter.” Minako said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right,” Ami confirmed, “they’re circulating around the access point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And <em>they’re</em> there,” Rei said darkly, “the humans.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako looked to her companion. “Can you be sure they’re the same as the humans we saw on Jupiter?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  were rather far away on Jupiter to make out any details,” Ami noted,  “and here, all we have is infrared, so we can’t really-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’re  the same.” Rei spat. “I can tell by their auras. Four human men, one  human woman. They’re nearly as tainted by the darkness as the youma,  but… I can’t sense anything distinguishable. The darkness that  surrounds them is so great that I can’t identify them further.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So we still have little to go by.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami’s comment was purely analytical in nature, but Rei growled nonetheless.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wait,” Ami said. “The two of you, focus on the access point. We may be able to leave here with more information.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  and Rei did as they were told, only to be met with the Mercurian’s  frustrated sigh. “No go. I’d hoped to get a reading on the access  point; to discern if it was made of Earth materials, but I just can’t  see clearly enough, not even with all the different settings I filtered  through.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We could get closer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s brow furrowed at  Rei’s dangerous idea. “No.” The Venusian decided swiftly. “We got what  we came for. The clues still point to Earth. Now let’s go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good  work, you two. I have a lot of data to analyze and compare to our  findings on Jupiter. Please return as quickly as possible. Ami out.”  The communicator crackled and the transmission ended.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t even  think about it.” Minako growled warningly, her eyes trained on the  Martian, so eager to throw herself into battle. “I know you want  revenge, but there are entirely too many of them down there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  frowned. Her hand balled into a fist, released, then clenched once  more. The Venusian laid a hand on her shoulder and the Priestess was  forced to look into those cerulean eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ll get your chance, Rei, trust me. Now come on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Priestess nodded reluctantly, and turned, only to be met with the  frightening vision of a youma standing right on top of them. She’d been  unable to sense its approach – its aura had blended in with mass of the  others in the crater, and there was no time to act; only to react.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako frowned when the Priestess’ stony expression shifted into a look of shock. “Rei?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then the Venusian was being pushed to the icy ground, Rei’s body shoving her down roughly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  all Minako could see was claws that narrowly missed her face, but that  didn’t miss Rei at all. The Martian squinted and grunted as she took  the blow, and used the inertia of their combined weight to roll both  their bodies away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian scrambled to her feet and pulled  the Priestess up with her. She hadn’t even finished transforming, the  golden light hadn’t even faded when Sailor Venus thrust her sword  through the youma’s neck and sliced upwards savagely. Its head fell to  the ground and rolled at their feet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Run.” Venus barked. “Do it  now! We have to get away from the crater!” Already, more of the  monsters were rushing them. “We have to lure the scouts away so they  don’t call for reinforcements or we’ll never stand a chance!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Both  women sprinted, running as fast as they could from the gaping mouth of  the crater. Rei soon lost speed. Breathing had already been difficult  due to the thin atmosphere, but to sprint under such conditions, and to  do so while being chased and wounded, was quickly taking its toll.  Venus ran alongside her, and she knew the senshi was slowing down to  keep pace with her. The Martian dug deeper, and upped her pace.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But they were soon surrounded by far too many youma.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Wild  eyes of amethyst and cerulean looked to the circle that tightened  around them of what was easily three dozen youma, three times what they  had fought as a group of four. The women pressed their backs to each  other, slouched into defensive stances and unsheathed their swords.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Of all things to do, Venus laughed. “If we make it out of this alive, I’m going to kill you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei snorted. “<em>Now</em> what did I do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That stunt you pulled back there that earned you that wound.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  wound is nothing, it’s just a scrape. Look, I’m fine! I’m barely even  bleeding.” The Martian sliced the air before her, effortlessly twirling  her sword in wide arcs to prove her point.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The golden warrior was unimpressed. “I’m warning you, Rei, don’t you <em>ever</em> sacrifice yourself for me again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sacrifice?” Rei cried. “What are you talking about? You claim to be this great diplomat, but you know <em>nothing</em> of Martian behaviors-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The youma took that as their cue and as one, with arms raised and mouths wide open, their lumbering forms charged the two women.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  as the wall of monsters approached, the Martian dropped to her knees in  a boneless heap. Her hand came to rest above her heart. Her breath all  but froze in her lungs. Her vision turned red. <em>‘What is this?’</em> Her eyes focused on the golden warrior – standing, she was an easier  target, and as fierce claws reached out for Venus’ slender form, Rei  felt the power she’d experienced on Jupiter surge to life within her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She didn’t hesitate. She embraced it fully. Rei screamed. She felt like she was on fire.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In reality, she was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  flames of Mars enveloped Rei’s body, flaring to life first in  individual red-orange tongues of fire, and then, Rei was no more. A  bright red light blinded the youma, blinded Venus, blinded herself. The  fire of her ravished planet, long held captive within her body, surged  forward, and when it had vanished, the senshi of Mars stood in Rei’s  place, and the many youma that had threatened her and her companion lie  scattered across the ground. Some were burned, some were charred, and  some were disintegrated completely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei…” Venus’ voice was a whisper.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The raven haired warrior shook her head. “Mars.” She whispered as correction.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mars.” Venus’ tongue sampled her new comrade’s name like an exotic delicacy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  the youma weren’t defeated yet. Many rose on shaky legs. Most of them  were injured, weakened, but they still had sheer numbers to their  advantage.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus pressed her back to Mars’ once more.”Ready?” She asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When you are.” Mars replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With  a piercing shout, the golden warrior launched herself into the fray,  sword raised as she sliced with one hand, her other arm cocked behind  her as she unleashed a steady stream of precisely aimed crescent beams.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars  could have been Venus’ dark reflection. She too lunged into the fray  with a chilling shout, her sword swinging, while she unleashed a  similar attack that was based not off of light, but of fire; a burning  mandala that would seek out prey and incinerate it within its whirling  vortex.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus kept an eye on the new senshi. Mars’ power was raw,  untamed, and fiercely reactive, much like the Priestess herself, but  the biggest surprise was that together, the two women fought as one in  a near even match of skill and power. Complementing each other’s  weakness and reinforcing their strengths, they seemed to come together  and cover each others’ backs when the enemy crushed in around them, and  they spread out for maximum kill effect when the youma dispersed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It had seemed like an impossible task, but in little time, the icy ground was littered with youma corpses.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  thrust her sword into the heart of a monster that twitched on the  ground, bleeding, but not dead until her finishing blow killed it off.  “Did we get them all?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There!” Venus shouted, and she pointed to  a limping straggler who was desperately trying to edge its way back to  camp, back to the crater, back to reinforcements.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars thrust her  left hand before her and cocked her right hand to her shoulder.  Suddenly, she found herself looking down the sight of not only a  fire-arrow, but a fire-bow, the other half of the deadly attack she had  sampled in her last skirmish against the youma. A flame sniper.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  fire-arrow screamed through the air and found its mark. The monster hit  the ground well shy of the crater it had hoped to seek reinforcements  within.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The still air was oppressively quiet as the two senshi  stared at each other. The warrior of love openly examined the warrior  of fire. Her crimson colored fuku was unremarkable with its  similarities to the rest of the senshi’s. Her powers, though  exceptionally strong, were equally as unremarkable, nearly a similar  attack compared to her own, albeit with a different element.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was the woman herself, however, that was remarkable. And it was a  thought that the Venusian just couldn’t seem to shake, no matter how  hard she tried.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus took a hesitant step towards Mars. Her  voice turned serious, scolding. “You would so willingly become a  senshi, Priestess?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Apparently, that decision was not mine to  make. It is who I am.” Mars’ voice shared Rei’s cold tone that harkened  back to when the Venusian had first met her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then you would give your life for our Princess?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve  been informed that it is my duty. To defend and protect…” she paused,  and looked into Venus’ cerulean gaze, “what is mine, comes with this  price.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako wasn’t sure how to interpret the Martian’s words.  She took another step closer. “And you would accept my command on the  field of battle?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve already proven your leadership  abilities to me.” The Martian’s voice lost some of its previous venom.  She would have never expected it, but she could see this woman as her  equal and her commander, If not something more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus took one  step closer, so that there was no more distance between them. “And you  would trust me, with your life?” It was obvious that this was no longer  Venus speaking, but Minako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Have I not already done that?” Mars asked, her words quiet, thoughtful. “Since the first day that we met? As you did for me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian’s tense body relaxed slightly, her shoulders slumped, but her fists did not release. “Then why didn’t you <em>tell</em> me you were the heir to your planet, Rei?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It wasn’t relevant at the time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  that was just like the Martian. Practical. Relevant. Both those words  accurately described the Priestess, but Minako had learned the fiery  Martian also had other words in her hidden vocabulary. Passion.  Loyalty. A fierce sense of determination. And when these seldom seen  attributes were aimed at <em>her</em>, the fact that the quirky Priestess could sometimes be distant and closed didn’t seem to matter so much.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>But… am I relevant to her now?’ </em>It was a question that begged to be answered, but it was not the place or the time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  was becoming quite the norm, Venus’ melodic laugh shattered the  stillness between them. She pointed to the Martian’s senshi footwear.  “It would have to be high heels, for as much as you complained about  them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian frowned. In the heat of battle, the last thing  she’d taken notice of was her attire, and to find herself clothed in  the same skimpy outfit she’d so thoroughly poked fun at raised an  embarrassed blush to her cheeks.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think you <em>like</em> it.” Venus said in a singsong voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do <em>not</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Still,  you should thank me for tricking you into wearing dresses and high  heels in the palace. It was good practice, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars felt her hackles rise. “So it <em>was</em> a trick!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come on already,” Venus walked away casually. “Let’s get the hell out of here. Mako-chan won’t be happy to hear we broke <em>both</em> of her conditions.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  flames of Mars cut a path through the thin and slippery ice. The loose  gravel was much preferable to spending hours falling on one’s rear end,  and the two women cautiously made their way back to the teleport  circuit.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That power would have been helpful a few hours ago, you know.” Venus whined.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, you know me,” Mars spat. “I just <em>love</em> to give you things to complain about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian laid a mocking hand over her heart. “Your sarcasm wounds me so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll bet you’re just disappointed that you don’t have an excuse to lean on me anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve seen <em>right</em> through me, Rei.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian looked to the Venusian. It was all too obvious that the golden warrior wasn’t really joking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars  grabbed Venus by the wrist roughly. The barbs, the innuendo, the  tension between them, not to mention the near misses and Minako’s  drunken inhibitions the night before… it was all too much for the  Priestess to ignore any longer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And if the Venusian was too afraid to take that step that she so obviously wanted to take, then she’d just have to take it <em>for</em> her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve had enough of this.” Mars spat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus’  breath caught in her throat. A firm tug on her wrist had her falling  into the slightly taller woman and the next thing she knew, the  Martian’s lips had roughly claimed her own in a savage kiss.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With a gasping breath, both women parted. Venus couldn’t read Mars’ cloudy eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian frowned. “That’s what you wanted, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Am I the selfish one, Rei?” Venus’ uncertain voice was so unlike the woman. “Am I the only one that wanted that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars  hadn’t been equipped to deal with that imploring response, the emotion  in Venus’ voice, and she couldn’t find a single appropriate word in <em>any</em> language with which to express herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And Venus was waiting.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Those  amethyst eyes softened. One arm wrapped loosely around Venus’ waist and  her gloved fingers found the other woman’s chilled cheek.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This kiss was soft. It was tender. It was thousands of unspoken words too early to utter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They parted again. Venus’ cerulean eyes were slow to flutter open, as though she were caught in a dream-like state.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">From  there, it was impossible to tell who initiated what. If their first  kiss had been awkward, and their second gentle and sweet, then the  third was exploratory. Mars’ arms tightened around Venus, and Venus  clawed at Mars’ back. The fourth was excited, and the fifth… the fifth  was sheer passion, and both women were left panting in its wake.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  Mars wanted more, and was surprised when she was met with resistance. A  gentle finger was pressed to her lips and the Priestess opened her eyes  in confusion.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t get me wrong. I fully intend to pick up where we left off,” Venus whispered, and then smirked, “but could we <em>please</em> get the hell off this pole?!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Race you.” Mars whispered huskily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re on.” Venus growled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  two senshi made a break for it, for the faster they could get back to  the transport circuit and back to their shuttle on the other end of the  transport jump, the faster they’d be back in each others arms,  exploring this new dynamic to their relationship.</span></p>

Author’s Notes:
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally! So, was the wait for the inevitable Rei/Mina get-together scene worth it? And no, don’t worry, it’s not <em>nearly</em> over between the two of them. What did you think?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Oh,  and the Eternity Main System is the manga name for the super computer  on the Moon. And yes, Chao-Meng Fu crater really is a real location on  Mercury’s northern pole.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Preview, Chapter 7: On Venus: Martyr</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A barely controlled fist pounded the table.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you mean she’s gone back to Venus!?” Rei exclaimed at breakfast the next morning.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto’s  hand lunged for her juice glass and her quick reflexes kept the orange  liquid from spilling onto the table. “We got a dispatch from her planet  late yesterday afternoon. Apparently, the youma invasion is getting  worse on Venus and there was a skirmish outside the main capital.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you guys let her go alone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Its not that we wanted to let her go by herself, Rei-san.” Ami clarified.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Priestess frowned darkly. ‘<em>That  hypocrite! She can’t be allowed to scold me for not accepting her help  the way she did on Jupiter if she’s going to do the same thing to me.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  know how she gets,” Serenity pointed her fork at Rei, “all we can do is  support her from here. Besides, we made her promise she wouldn’t fight.  She was only allowed to go if she agreed to check the damage, show her  support for her people, and come back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Sure. We promised not to fight the youma on Mercury’s pole, too.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto nodded brightly. “Yeah, and if the youma attack the city again, she knows we’re on standby if she needs our help.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei pounded the table again, and this time, Makoto’s juice did splash out of her glass.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serenity jumped to her feet. “Rei-chan, where are you going?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian halted at the door before glancing back over her shoulder. “To Venus!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  slammed the door behind her with an air of finality but she’d no sooner  turned down the next hall than a timid voice caught up to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei-san, wait!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Against  her better judgment, the Priestess stopped and waited for the blue  haired genius to catch up. The small woman stood well outside the  Martian’s boundary of personal space and bit her lower lip nervously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Before  Mina-chan left, she consulted me about something.” She said  tentatively. “I… explained to her about Martian possessiveness, that  when a Martian finds something they deem worth protecting, they go to  great lengths to protect it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why are you telling me things I already understand?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because you <em>don’t</em> know about Venusians. Rei-san.” Ami said with a sad frown. “It’s in a  Venusian’s nature to either love freely, or love deeply. I… just don’t  know which Minako is.”</span></p>
