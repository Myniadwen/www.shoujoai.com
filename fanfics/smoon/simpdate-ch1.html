<h1>Simple Date</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/newtype.html">Newtyp L.G.</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The doorbell to the Mizuno residence began to ring. &quot;Hey mom thats 
Makoto can you get it please, i&#39;m not ready yet.&quot; The elder Mizuno put 
her book down to answer the door. &quot;Hi Makoto.&quot; Isha Mizuno greeted 
happily. &quot;Hello Isha-san. How are you doing tonight?&quot; Makoto said as she 
walked in. &quot;Fine; she&#39;s almost ready.&quot; As she pointed up to Ami&#39;s room 
&quot;So where are you guys going tonight?&quot; Makoto sort of blushed at the 
question. &quot;Well, not to seem plain but to just dinner and a show is what 
we have planned so far.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s alright.&quot; Isha said as she sat down to 
read her book again. &quot;Well I&#39;m ready now.&quot; Ami said walking down to 
where her date and her mother was. &quot;Well let&#39;s go then.&quot; Makoto said 
eagerly. As they walked out the door Ami said. &quot;Bye mom, love you.&quot; &quot;Bye 
Isha-san.&quot; said Makoto. &quot;Bye you two, have fun now.&quot; Isha said as she 
closed the door behind them. After seeing the door close they begin to 
walk out of the complex. &quot;Have you thought of any place to eat?&quot; Makoto 
asked Ami. &quot;Not sure, how about we walk just a little till I think of 
one.&quot; She suggested. &quot;Okay, sure.&quot; Makoto said as they walked on down 
the street. 

Almost an hour of walking down the street Makoto finally spoke up. 
&quot;Ami-chan, have you thought of a place yet? It&#39;s already been an hour 
since we left.&quot; She complained. 

&quot;Well, I heard of this nice but simple restaurant called Chikyu Uchi.&quot; 
Ami said. &quot;It really gives you this &#39;at home feeling&#39;, people said.&quot; She 
explained. &quot;And they said it&#39;s not far from my place when I asked.&quot; 

&quot;Sounds good enough.&quot; Makoto said as she and Ami began to walk again. 
&quot;So where is this place then?&quot; She asked. 

&quot;They said about three blocks further down.&quot; 

&quot;Okay then let&#39;s go.&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

A little bit more walking and a little chit chat later Ami and Makoto 
arrive at their destination the Chikyu Uchi, a very nice and elegant 
building that gave off a very down to earth feel. As Ami and Makoto 
walked in they saw that the inside was far better then the outside. The 
lobby was full of Victorian Style lounge chairs and a small fire place 
off into the corner. The dining room was almost that of a palace with 
elegantly crafted tables with fine crafted silver ware and very stunning 
china. A very spectacular sight indeed. 

Makoto stunned by the look of the place looked at Ami. &quot;Ami-chan what 
did the people you talked to say about this place again?&quot; 

&quot;They said it gives you a &#39;at home feeling&#39;.&quot; She replied 

&quot;Oh. Well if your a really rich person then yeah I can understand the 
&#39;at home feeling&#39;.&quot; She joked. 

Just then the hostess came up to them. &quot;Table for how many?&quot; She asked 
looking at Ami. 

&quot;Um, two.&quot; 

&quot;Excellent, follow me now.&quot; As she directed Ami and Makoto to thier 
table. 

A little while later having ordered and eaten thier meals Ami and Makoto 
decided to just talk about a few things. 

&quot;Isn&#39;t this nice, just me and you for once Mako-chan?&quot; Ami said 

&quot;Yeah, things have been so hectic lately what with fighting youmas and 
all and don&#39;t even get me started with school.&quot; Makoto complained. &quot;It 
feels like I haven&#39; t seen you in months.&quot; 

&quot;I know and I&#39;ve missed you.&quot; 

&quot;So have I.&quot; She said as she kissed Ami on the lips oblivious of who was 
looking. 

After they kissed they just began to talk some more. &quot;You know this 
place really looks so familiar. Have we been here before?&quot; Makoto asked. 

&quot;Yeah I think we have.&quot; Ami said while looking at a select few 
decorations. 

&quot;Really?&quot; Makoto said confusingly. &quot;We have been here?&quot; She said while 
still looking for something to remind her. 

&quot;Come on Mako-chan, you don&#39;t remember anything about this place.&quot; 

&quot;Not really.&quot; Makoto replied 

&quot;You sure you don&#39;t remember that piano or even that statue and 
painting?&quot; She pointed to items in question. &quot;Or at least that pot of 
roses?&quot; 

Makoto looked at each of the items and gasped. &quot;Ohh!&quot; She then began to 
blush while Ami began to giggle. 

&quot;This is were we all spied on Chibi-usa.&quot; Makoto said finally realizing 
that this was the same place they made fools of themselves and 
embarrassed Chibi-usa. 

&quot;That was sure a bad move by us.&quot; Ami said. 

They started giggling about the whole event when they noticed that 
everyone just ducked down all a sudden. They followed the eyes of the 
people and saw a huge blast of green energy coming right at them. They 
ducked just in time as the blast blew up the front of the restaurant. 
When the smoke cleared there stood a 10foot tall, scalely, cobra-like, 
muscular youma and from behind the giant youma there came a human-like 
woman of average size with hair hair that had black, green, and silver 
streaks. &quot;Now thats an entrance.&quot; She joked. She then began to scan the 
restaurant looking for someone till her eyes landed on the hostess. 

&quot;There, thats the one we need to talk to. Get her Jormungander!&quot; She 
commanded the massive youma. 

&quot;Yes Kuriku.&quot; The youma hissed as it stomped towards the hostess 
ignoring the people that ran passed him.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As everyone sreamed and ran out the exit provided by the youma Ami and 
Makoto followed them but ducked into an ally next to the restaurant 
while others ran as far as they could. 

&quot;Just great a damn youma attack, of all times.&quot; Makoto complained. &quot;What 
the hell are we going to do.&quot; She yelled out. 

&quot;Let&#39;s call the others.&quot; Ami suggested. 

&quot;We can&#39;t, they&#39;er all gone.&quot; 

Hearing this all Ami could say was. &quot;Whaaat?!&quot; 

&quot;Minako went to Europe to see an old friend. Rei is at some temple in 
Kyoto and Usagi is with her family in Hawaii.&quot; Makoto explained. 

&quot;Right, I forgot about their plans.&quot; Just then she got an idea. &quot;What 
about the Outers.&quot; she asked. 

Makoto shook her head. &quot;We can&#39;t, Michiru went on some tour called 
&#39;Classics of the Age&#39; and Haruka, Setsuna, and Hotaru went along with 
her.&quot; She said with despair. 

&quot;Oh FUCK!&quot; Ami replied mad about how things were now against them. 

&quot;AMI!&quot; Makoto said shocked. 

&quot;Sorry.&quot; Ami blushed at what she said. &quot;I guess we&#39;er on our own now.&quot; 

&quot;You think we could take them.&quot; 

&quot;I have no idea.&quot; She said before shouting. &quot;MERCURY CRYSTAL POWER.&quot; 

&quot;Oh this will suck then.&quot; Makoto joked then shouted.&quot;JUPITER CRYSTAL 
POWER.&quot; 

&lt;&quot;Transformation scene ride, everybody say WEEEEEEE!!!.&quot; Says the 
Author.&gt; 

&lt;&quot;background singing, background transitions, ribbon twirling, ribbon 
wrapping, FLASH, transformations compleeeete, and DRAMATIC POSE!!! The 
Author sings. &quot;Okay rides over everybody off, come on.&quot; The Author 
commands.&gt;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jormungander was close to the hostess and was reaching out. &quot;SUPREME 
THUNDER!&quot; He heard someone shout before he was hit by a blast of 
lightning that sent him into the wall. 

Kuriku ran to him. &quot;Jor are you all right.&quot; She looked at the hostess 
and back at him. &quot;What the hell was that.&quot; She said confused. 

&lt;&quot;Cheap lines in 3, 2, 1.&quot;&gt; 

&quot;That&#39;s what you get when you ruin a perfect evening for everyone.&quot; 
Jupiter shouted. 

&quot;Now get ready to pay for causing so much trouble.&quot; Mercury said. 

&quot;Who the hell are you people.&quot; Kuriku demanded. 

&quot;We are the Sailor Scouts.&quot; Jupiter and Mercury said in unison. 

&quot;Sailor Mercury&quot; 

&quot;Sailor Jupiter.&quot; 

&quot;And in the name of Mercury and Jupiter, we shall punish you.&quot; They 
pointed at Kuriku. 

Kuriku looked at them with a smirk. &quot;It&#39;s impolite to point at people.&quot; 
She said then shot a beam of red energy from her eyes. 

Mercury and Jupiter dodged the shot. 

&quot;MERCURY AQUA RHAPSODY!&quot; Mercury shouted her attack. 

Kuriku dodged the streams of freezing water. Jupiter tried to get her 
with a punch but Kuriku moved out of the way and Jormungander sprung 
from the ground and grabbed Jupiter by the waist. 

&quot;I have you now.&quot; He hissed 

&quot;You wish.&quot; She smirked. &quot;JUPITER THUNDER CRASH.&quot; She struck 
Jormungander in the middle of his face. 

&quot;RRRRRRAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot; He screamed in pain and stepped back a few 
feet. 

&quot;Now, JUPITER OAK EVOLUTION!&quot; She shouted her strongest attack. 

Jormungander was hit with the full force of the attack and fell down 
face first into the ground and was unconscious. 

&quot;Jor are you all...............&quot; 

&quot;MERCURY AQUA RHAPSODY.&quot; Mercury interrupted Kuriku. 

Kuriku tried to dodge but her legs had become frozen. &quot;Damn it!&quot; She 
shouted as she looked up at Mercury and Jupiter. &quot;What the hell are you 
people thinking, attacking us like that.&quot; She accused them. 

&quot;Us. We were trying to keep you from hurting people.&quot; Jupiter shouted 
back. 

&quot;Hurting people?&quot; Kuriku said confused. &quot;What are you people talking 
about.&quot; 

&quot;You were going to hurt that lady.&quot; Mercury pointed to the hostess. 

&quot;We weren&#39;t going to hurt her.&quot; Kuriku said. 

&quot;If you weren&#39;t going to hurt her, then what were you going to do.&quot; 
Jupiter demanded. 

Just then Jormungander got up on to his knees. &quot;We were going to ask for 
some service.&quot; He pointed out. 

&quot;You wanted to eat here?&quot; Mercury asked confused 

&quot;Why?&quot; Jupiter asked. 

&quot;Cause it is our wedding anniversary.&quot; Kuriku explained. 

&quot;You two are married.&quot; Jupiter asked while she and Mercury looked back 
and forth between Kuriku and Jormungander. 

&quot;Yes, and is there anything wrong with that.&quot; Kuriku asked. 

&quot;No, nothing wrong.&quot; Jupiter and Mercury said in unison. 

&quot;Hold on, if you wanted to eat here how come you blew up the front of 
the retaurant.&quot; Mercury pointed out. 

&quot;Yeah?&quot; Jupiter asked as well. 

&quot;Well if you didn&#39;t notice....................&quot; Jormungander was about 
to explain. 

&quot;My husband is a damn giant.&quot; Kuriku interrupted. &quot;And he can&#39;t fit 
throught the damn door.&quot; 

&quot;Thanks dear.&quot; He said sarcasticly and got a glare from his wife. 

&quot;And we were hoping to get some food.&quot; Kuriku said. 

&quot;Like thats going to happen.&quot; Jormungander said in dissappointment. 

&quot;Oh well lets just go back to the Shadow Realm.&quot; Kuriku said as she 
opened a portal. 

Mercury came up to Kuriku and said. &quot;We&#39;er really sorry about 
everything.&quot; 

&quot;It was all one big misunderstanding.&quot; Jupiter said. 

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Jormungander said. &quot;Besides who has enough food let alone 
want to serve a youma like me.&quot; 

&quot;Goodbye.&quot; Jupiter and Mercury said in unison. 

&quot;Goodbye.&quot; Kuriku said. &quot;It was really weird meeting you guys like 
this.&quot; 

Well Kuriku and Jormungander stepped throught the portal and waved as it 
closed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Later on that night Ami and Makoto were really confused about the whole 
event that took place ealier in the night. 

&quot;The others aren&#39;t going to believe this.&quot; Ami said 

&quot;Yeah, this is just to weird even for us.&quot; Makoto replied. 

At that point Makoto slipped her hand around Ami. &quot;All in all is wasn&#39;t 
a bad night.&quot; 

&quot;I guess your ritght.&quot; Ami said. &quot;But despite the fact they&#39;er youmas, 
they were really weird.&quot; 

&quot;No kidding.&quot; Makoto joked.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mean while in the Shadow Realm. 

&quot;Those Sailor Scouts were really weird weren&#39;t they.&quot; Kuriku said. 

&quot;No kidding.&quot; Jormungander said. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Well this is my very first Yuri fanfiction and I sort of think I did a 
good enough job on this story. I know I didn&#39;t cover Ami and Makoto as 
much as I should have but all in all I think it&#39;s okay. Well to cover 
the things that people may have some questions on her are some of the 
answers. First off the name that I gave Ami&#39;s mom, &#39;Isha&#39; means 
(according to this dictionary I got Japanese to English and English to 
Japanese) doctor and so I thought it would fit since Ami&#39;s mom is a 
doctor and naming the restaurant &#39;Chikyu Uchi&#39; is somthing I thought 
would be okay cause (like &#39;Isha&#39;) came from the same dictionary and 
Chikyu=Earth and Uchi=House and thought that would be good for a 
restaurant that gives off an &#39;at home feeling&#39;. Finally the whole Scouts 
embarrising Chibi-usa was an episode in the Sailor Moon Super S series 
and only four of the scouts moved in hidding behind objects to hear what 
Chibi-usa was going to say. This is what object each scout hid behind. 
Makoto=Piano, Rei=Painting, Minako=Pot of Roses on a stand, and last 
Usagi=the Statue. Last I don&#39;t know the Japanes names of the attacks and 
Jormungander was the name of a giant snake from Norse Mythology. The who 
killed and was killed by Thor. Well thats all. </pre>
