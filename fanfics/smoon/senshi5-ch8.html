<h1>Senshi: the Gathering of Five (part 8 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/senshi5-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>        Makoto Kino smiled to herself slightly as they reached the 
gates to the amusement park. Beside her, Ami Mizuno studied the area 
around them, her gaze intense. The little black cat sat on Ami&#39;s 
shoulder, her fur ruffled a bit.

        &quot;It looks like they&#39;re here,&quot; Makoto murmured, the eerie near 
silence of the park washing over them. Rides, happy yelling, music, 
nothing was coming from the normally active place.

        &quot;Let&#39;s move in, then,&quot; Ami murmured as they pushed through the 
gates. There was an odd charge to the air, an strange electricity.

        &quot;There!&quot; Makoto pointed to where a figure lay on the ground.

        &quot;Be careful,&quot; Luna barked, but both women ignored her.

        Ami hurried over, reaching into the bag that she carried to 
pull out an odd little visor, cables leading into the bad and attached 
to her laptop. The icy blue visor fit over her eyes, and touching the 
side seemed to activate it. She studied the still form for a moment, 
taping the keys of her laptop, then rose, looking towards the center 
of the park.

        &quot;The other youma, and more victims, are there,&quot; Ami said 
grimly as she put her laptop away, but kept the visor on.

        &quot;That might have been a disguised youma, playing possum,&quot; Luna 
growled at the two angrily. The little cat&#39;s body shifted, her form 
sliding to become the black haired woman, &quot;Could you be a bit more 
cautious, next time?&quot;

        &quot;I can handle it, Luna,&quot; Makoto smiled slightly, &quot;keep an eye 
on Ami, not me.&quot;

        Ami raised an eyebrow at that, but she didn&#39;t say anything. 
She looked at Luna, &quot;Is there any way we can help the victims?&quot;

        &quot;She&#39;s just been drained of energy,&quot; Luna looked down at the 
fallen, &quot;she&#39;ll recover, especially if we slay the youma that did 
this.&quot;

        &quot;Then let&#39;s do it,&quot; Makoto shrugged as they moved on into the 
park.

        The deadly quiet of the park surrounded them, even as the 
fallen people grew in numbers. The Ferris wheel soon loomed above them 
as they made their way through the stalls and game booths. A rustle 
and from the roof a figure leapt at them.

        Makoto moved without thinking, the taller girl shoving Ami 
aside even as she took the impact, rolling to cushion the force. The 
pink haired little girl smiled happily, revealing gleaming fangs, then 
she lunged for Makoto&#39;s throat. The child&#39;s strength was inhuman, 
struggling frantically to reach the bare throat even as she fought to 
keep her back.

        Ami reached into her bag, pulling out an oddly designed little 
gun. &quot;Can you get it away from you?&quot; she asked frantically.

        &quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; Makoto bit out. She got her hands under the 
struggling child, pushing away with all her strength and sending her 
up into the air.

        Ami aimed and fired! There was a flash of white, a burst of 
pure cold, and with a thump the demon spawn dropped to the ground. The 
ice block sealed it from head to toe, the oddly cute fanged creature 
gazing out in an expression of frozen surprise.

        &quot;I&#39;m impressed,&quot; Makoto managed, rubbing at her throat. Ami 
and Luna helped her to her feet, and the tall fighter looked at Ami 
with a certain respect in her eyes, &quot;What was that you used?&quot;

        &quot;The gun throws a chemically altered form of liquid Nitrogen,&quot; 
Ami explained as she walked over to the frozen youma. She kicked at 
the ice block, and the thing crumbled to dust.

        &quot;What was that about me keeping an eye on her?&quot; Luna asked 
Makoto with a slight smile.

        Makoto decided not to answer that.

        Ami tapped the side of her visor, a slight frown on her face. 
&quot;There&#39;s another youma out there,&quot; she said seriously, &quot;much more 
powerful than that one.&quot;

        &quot;Hopefully, I&#39;ll fair better against that one,&quot; Makoto smiled 
slightly.

        The three of them only took a few more steps forward when they 
all felt it, a deep feeling of pure revulsion. From the very top of 
the Ferris wheel the figure descended, his long reddish hair flowing 
around him as he flew. He was almost handsome looking, if you could 
ignore the utter contempt that he gazed out at the world with.

        &quot;And I thought I was done,&quot; he murmured, &quot;but it seems a few 
more sheep are wandering about, ready to be harvested.&quot;

        &quot;Not likely, Nephrite,&quot; Luna answered coldly.

        &quot;Senshi,&quot; the one called Nephrite murmured to himself softly, 
an odd sphere of milky light floating in the air beside him.

        &quot;How good are you fighting blind?&quot; Ami murmured to Makoto 
softly.

        &quot;Pretty good,&quot; Makoto answered in a whisper.

        Ami suddenly smiled, &quot;Good.&quot; She suddenly flung a little 
capsule on to the ground between them and Nephrite, and a cold fog 
billowed out, engulfing them all in whiteness.

        &quot;What in the..&quot; Nephrite started, looking about him wildly.

        Makoto moved like the wind, appearing right in front of the 
startled young man. The first blow broke his nose, sending black blood 
trickling down his face as he tried to raise his guard. He threw 
punches in return, but she dodged and weaved like the wind.

        &quot;Aaah!&quot; Nephrite cried out in pain, feeling a sharp, stabbing 
strike in his upper back. Turning around he caught a glimpse of Luna, 
the dark haired young woman carrying more throwing blades in her hand. 
With a soft growl of rage he began to shift, his body expanding, skin 
stretching outward as he shed his human shape.

        Ami raised her weapon as the change began, then Makoto cried 
out at her, &quot;No! I want to fight him once he&#39;s fully changed.&quot; 
Completely ignoring that Ami chose to fire, clipping him in the arm 
with a burst of cold.

        His eyes wide with panic Nephrite gestured, space seemed to 
tear, and a portal opened. &quot;Damn you for your interference,&quot; he cried, 
his one arm hanging limply at his side. But before he could step 
through Luna struck, tearing the glowing globe from his side.

        &quot;You will not claim your prize, creature,&quot; Luna gloated.

        Nephrite was furious, &quot;I will see you die for this, once the 
Oni awake you will all pay.&quot; With that he was gone, the portal fading 
away.

        Ami&#39;s visor worked, collecting data that she quickly relayed 
to her laptop. &quot;A few more like that,&quot; she murmured softly, &quot;and we&#39;ll 
know where their base is.&quot;

        Makoto pouted, &quot;You could have let me fight him a bit, first.&quot;

        &quot;Breaking his nose didn&#39;t count?&quot; Luna asked her as she 
shifted back to cat form. The glowing orb that Nephrite had been 
carrying quickly dissipated, the energy swirling back to return to the 
people that it was taken from.

        Makoto shrugged, &quot;That was just the warm-up.&quot;

        &quot;Look at it this way,&quot; Ami sighed, &quot;once we find their home 
base, you&#39;ll likely have all the fighting you can handle.&quot;

        &quot;Don&#39;t be so eager,&quot; a strange voice agreed, &quot;the war has 
barely begun.&quot;

        Looking up they saw her standing on top of one of the deserted 
stalls. Long blonde hair blew in the breeze like a flag, the skirt of 
her sailor fuku ruffling in the breeze. Her face was shadowed, her 
eyes hidden by a simple white mask. On her shoulder, a familiar 
looking white cat crouched.

        &quot;Artemis,&quot; Luna murmured softly.

        &quot;Who are you?&quot; Makoto demanded, bracing herself for another 
fight.

        Ami reached out to lay a gentle hand on the larger girl&#39;s arm, 
&quot;According to my scans, she&#39;s not one of the youma.&quot;

        &quot;No, I&#39;m not,&quot; the blonde smiled slightly. &quot;I was worried I 
was going to need to save you,&quot; she added, &quot;but I&#39;m glad I was wrong.&quot;

        &quot;Come down here,&quot; Ami offered, &quot;so we can talk.&quot;

        The blonde shook her head, &quot;You&#39;re not ready for that, not 
yet.&quot; She smiled at them suddenly, &quot;My name is Sailor V, and we will 
meet again!&quot; With that she almost seemed to vanish, disappearing into 
the darkness of the night.
