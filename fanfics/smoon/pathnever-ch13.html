<p><u>Death  Buster lab</u></p>
<p>“ARGH! Stupid computer, why won’t you  accept my commands?” She kicked the disobedient machine that  stubbornly flashed a ‘access denied’ at the rage driven witch.  “Great, looks like this thing is useless; someone has tampered with  it! Ooh…I bet it was Mimete! She’d do anything to sabotage me!  I’m going to get her for this…”</p>
<p>Eudial continued to  mutter evil torturous plots under her breath as she pulled out a  small lap top. “Until then, I’m stuck using this rinky dinky  obsolete computer.” She complained. “Not to mention this old  fashioned program. It’s more fun coming up with something  original.”</p>
<p>Click, tap, tap, tap. Click.</p>
<p>The witch  drummed her fingers impatiently upon her desk as the miniature device  scrolled through potential targets.</p>
<p>Blep. ‘Target  confirmed.’</p>
<p>“…” Eudial leaned forward to read the  selected name. “Tenoh, Kaiya…”</p>
<p><u>At the Shrine, the  inners have a talk</u></p>
<p><u></u>“You did what?”</p>
<p>“I  can’t believe you girls.”</p>
<p>It was neither of the huddled  group of girls that sat around the study table that had spoken but  their two guardians…who happened to be a pair of talking cats.  Luna, the dark purple colored feline attempted to restrain herself  from releasing her wraith upon the girls. Her opposite in both color  and demeanor, Artemis, cast a worried glance but chose to remain  silent.</p>
<p>Usagi returned a clueless stare to her frowning  guardian. Even though she had gotten used to having her cat talk back  at her, it still felt odd sometimes. This was one of those  times.</p>
<p>“What did we do that was so wrong Luna?” Usagi  whined. Her blue eyes started to tear.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I don’t see  what’s the big deal. I mean, we did get rid of the problem didn’t  we?” Minako complained to Artemis. The rest of the scouts nodded in  agreement, everyone except Ami.</p>
<p>Luna sighed in exasperation.  Hadn’t the girls learned anything through her years of instruction?  It only takes some common sense to see these simple flaws! “What do  you know about this stranger?”</p>
<p>“Umm…well, she has blonde  hair.” Usagi answered too soon. Luna was ready to snap back at her  young charge. How could it be that this nitwit still had no idea?  “And…well, she seems nice. Really cool looking and  mysterious…More than Uranus. Uranus is a bit of a grump sometimes  hehe…”</p>
<p>Artemis noticed Luna’s violently growing  twitches with each response.</p>
<p>“Ah- that’s enough Usagi!”  Artemis intervened finally. “I think we get the idea.” He turned  to Ami, who would surely clue her comrades in with the problem at  hand. “What did you pick up from the individual?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely  nothing.” A worried look crossed her features.</p>
<p>“So even  your computer found nothing…”</p>
<p>“Now do you see?” Luna  asked her charge once more. She hoped this time she wouldn’t  receive another ‘poke in the eye’ response.</p>
<p>“Hmm…So  she’s <em>super</em> mysterious!”</p>
<p>Everyone in the room fell  over and groaned.</p>
<p>“It means we can’t trust her.” Ami  coughed and cleared her throat. Even their group genius could handle  only so much stupidity. “Who she really is, where she came from,  what she’s really after is unknown to us. Doesn’t that make you  the least bit nervous?”</p>
<p>“I think the fact she knew our  attacks was scarier.” Makoto spoke up. “I didn’t think about it  at the time, but afterwards it sort of hit me. How did she know about  Mina’s love me chain or my thunder element? I mean, I know <em>I’ve</em> never seen her before. Does she spy on us or something?”</p>
<p>“…”  Finally someone else had said it. What if they had been spied on? It  surely wouldn’t have been the first time…</p>
<p>“You don’t  think she’s with the enemy do you?” It was Minako who broke the  silence this time. Artemis almost cried from happiness that his  charge wasn’t as bad as his companion’s. Such a blessing, he  sighed quietly.</p>
<p>“No way!”</p>
<p>“Usagi!” Her friends  shouted simultaneously.</p>
<p>“I’m serious.” She stared back  at everyone with determination. Her goofy expression had completely  vanished. “Is she was, then why would she help us? Wasn’t it the  enemy that made this bug?”</p>
<p>The room went  silent once more, each individual in their own thought. They all knew  too well that this new ‘friend’ Rai could be pretending. However  they also knew that they could tell their princess this fact a  million times and it would never sink in! Usagi was too kind, too  trusting. All they could do was try to protect her harm…</p>
<p>“In  any case, stay on guard.” Artemis warned the girls. “Luna and I  will try to find information on this individual but until we do, be  careful.”</p>
<p>“Right.” The scouts nodded.</p>
<p><strong>Rap,  rap.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Kaiya’s POV, moments before, bedroom</u></p>
<p><u></u>It’s  morning…What time is it? I heard the sheets shift as I rolled over  to see the clock. At first I could only see a blur of red, that was,  until I blinked and rubbed my eyes. 10:00 a.m.? Oh man, I yawned. My  hand came up to muffle the lazy sound. I don’t think I’ve slept  in this long. Ever! Lazy, lazy, lazy a voice inside nagged. I didn’t  mean to but I was tired, give me a break! I flopped onto my back,  noticing how my hair sprawled out in random patterns.</p>
<p>Another peaceful morning…I closed my eyes, trying to take  in all the sensations. The room wasn’t too hot or cold; it was a  pleasantly cool temperature to my liking. It was also dark but not  too dark thanks to the open window. A whole month and a bit, that’s  how long I’ve been here. Although it was a short amount of time, it  felt like forever; so much has happened.</p>
<p>So many battles. I  opened my eyes again. No doubt in my mind that the last was the  hardest one yet. The image of flooded streets arose in my mind’s  eye, then the infiltration of the water plant. Everyone was there  working together. I think that was the first time I’ve ever worked  the inners… come to think of it, it was also the first time Uranus  and I didn’t try to blow each other out of the water. Instead,  Uranus ended up saving me.</p>
<p><em>“I know this may be a bad  time, but do you have a name?”</em></p>
<p>Heh…I took a few deep  breaths, bringing my emotions back under control. It made me want to  laugh and cry at the same time.</p>
<p>I wonder how much time I  have left? I rested the back of my hand to my forehead. If things  continue on at this pace, I really might die here. But…that’s not  a bad thing is it? I met so many people, who actually care about me.  And I know I came here to kill my parents, but I…</p>
<p>…I don’t  want to go back. I want to stay here…</p>
<p><u>Outside,  minutes later</u></p>
<p>I gave another yawn as I walked out of  my room in a regular change of clothes. Rei wouldn’t mind me  skipping out on the miko outfit, we’ve all been through a lot  lately. It’ll take some time before everything is completely back  to normal…On the other hand, Rei is already bringing the  normal-ness back to life around here; she’s gotten the habit  yelling her head off at me and Yuuchiro back. Speaking of the guy, he  must be pretty happy not going to the super market everyday for  bottled water. I bet he’s sick of the stuff now! I chuckled; too  bad you need water to live buddy.</p>
<p>I rounded a corner to the  broom closet. While I’m up, I might as well help out around here  and I don’t think anyone has swept up the front yet.</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p><strong>Tup, tup, tup.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I walked out and down the small  set of steps onto the concrete entrance.</p>
<p>“I guess I was  right.”</p>
<p>Dutifully I began. It wasn’t hard to do…might  be a little boring, but that was okay. All that would happen is my  mind would start to wander…Like to Haruka and Michiru. I wonder how  they’re doing? They haven’t called or anything since the  incident. Is Michiru still sick?</p>
<p>Ah Haruka…I gave a heavy  sigh and leaned onto the broom handle. You almost lost her didn’t  you? We both almost did. What were you feeling when you saw her  unconscious? Worried? Fearful? Perhaps scared…?</p>
<p>You have to  tell her!</p>
<p>I gripped the fragile piece of wood in my hands  tightly. In fairy tales, isn’t this where the prince should save  the princess? Or in this case <em>tell</em> the princess?</p>
<p>Should…the  thought echoed through my head. Darker thoughts threatened to  resurface. <strong>I</strong> shouldn’t be here…</p>
<p><strong>Tup, tup ,  tup…</strong></p>
<p>A patter of footsteps seized my attention and guess  who it was? I had to smile.</p>
<p>“Hey pretty girl! Would you give  Rei and her girlfriends these milk and cookies? I’d do it but Rei  forbade me from the vicinity. It’s like she don’t trust me or  something.” He laughed.</p>
<p>Well…grandpa is still  grandpa.</p>
<p>“Sure, I’d be happy to.” I took the tray from  Rei’s grandfather and he took my broom. In my mind, it was a good  exchange. I guess no chores for me today.</p>
<p><strong>Tup,  tup…</strong></p>
<p>Hmm…Now that I think about it, maybe I should go  and fine Haruka and Michiru. I could get some fresh air while I’m  at it; I haven’t left the shrine since the flooding. A change of  pace is what I need. Who knows, maybe Makoto would like to go out  training again or something. It would give me a brush up on my skills  again.</p>
<p>I stopped short outside Rei’s room when voices caught  my interest.</p>
<p>“…be careful.”</p>
<p>“Right”</p>
<p>I  stood there, thinking about what I had just heard. That doesn’t  sound like studying. Feeling intrigued I slowly lifted up a  half-closed fist and lightly rapped on the door.</p>
<p><strong>Rap,  rap…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>No one was going to answer? Guess that means come  in, I cheerfully thought.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Careful about what?”</p>
<p>I  was instantly met with stares and open mouths. As I scanned both  sides of the study table, I noted how each surprised look was exactly  identical. It was kinda freaky.</p>
<p>Umm… “Hello?”</p>
<p>Rei  was the first to ‘speak’. “W-wait, w-w-what are you…!”</p>
<p>“Oh,  your grandpa asked me to bring you guys milk and cookies.” I walked  over and plopped the metal tray onto the study table. There was more  than enough room, hardly any textbooks in sight. Some study  session…</p>
<p>“FOOD!” Usagi lunged forward.</p>
<p>“Watch  it!”</p>
<p>At least some things never change. The comedic action  had brought the room back to life.</p>
<p>“You really surprised us  Kaiya.” Makoto sighed.</p>
<p>“No kidding.” Minako added. “Try  knocking or something.”</p>
<p>Umm…but I did knock. “What do  you guys have to be careful about anyway?” Something was off; they  looked a little <em>too</em> relieved.</p>
<p>“Look, it’s nothing!”  Rei snapped. I noted this reaction; it was the usual response the  miko gave when she was trying to hide something.</p>
<p>I raised an  eyebrow. “Really? Nothing at all?”</p>
<p>“Test questions.”  It was Ami to save the day. “There were a few unexpected problem  types on the last exam and we were discussing what to look out for in  the unit final.”</p>
<p>… “Oh…”</p>
<p>Again soft sighs of  relief echoed throughout the room.</p>
<p>“So when is the  test?”</p>
<p>Immediately everyone tensed up once more. In these  situations, you don’t need to see the person’s face to know what  they’re feeling…for me anyway. The vibrations in the air were  starting to get a tad bit heavy again.</p>
<p>“Meow…”</p>
<p>Darn,  someone stole Ami’s role…and it was getting good!</p>
<p>“A  cat?” Wait, there were two. “Hey, they have a crescent moon on  their foreheads.” Now isn’t that unusual? I mused.</p>
<p>Usagi  suddenly turned on the spot and picked up the dark colored one in a  flash. The moment was like a blur. “Twiff won’s  mine.”</p>
<p>“Umm…”</p>
<p>She swallowed. “This one is  mine. Her name is Luna!”</p>
<p>“And this is Artemis!” Minako  mimicked the action.</p>
<p>Both girls dangled their pets in front  of my face. I felt sorry for the poor creatures…</p>
<p>But  something else was on my mind. Luna and Artemis…those names also  sounded familiar. I’ve heard them from somewhere. And those  crescent moons on their foreheads are definitely…</p>
<p>“MEROW!”</p>
<p>Real.</p>
<p>“Luna!” Usagi shook the cat. “You  shouldn’t scratch people! Are you okay?” She asked me. Unknown to  her, the cut had already begun healing. I immediately covered the  inflicted area to avoid suspicion.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ll be fine. I  guess I shouldn’t have poked her in the head.”</p>
<p>“But  still…”</p>
<p>I need to draw their attention  away from me, I thought. Anything would do; I must be becoming  paranoid or something because for a moment it looked like the cats  were staring at me. “So Rei, is your dad’s social party on the go  still?” Although I’ve heard the two relatives don’t get along,  apparently Rei’s dad invited her along to this dance party for the  snobs. A business party from what I understood.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s  still on for today.” She growled. She really tried to look like she  didn’t care but it was clear that something else was bothering her.  “…Probably wants me to meet some guy.”</p>
<p>“And you don’t  want to?” Ami raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>Minako seemed to glare out  into space. “What do you think?” Usagi asked her preoccupied  friend.</p>
<p>“He’ll probably be some wind bag.” Minako  muttered. She then stood up and did her own impersonation of the  possible suitor. “Harumph, my father says that oil is rising on the  stock exchange at exponential rates.” She stopped to pretend to sip  wine from an invisible glass, causing us all to roar with  laughter.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised.” Rei managed to  cough out.</p>
<p>“You need a body guard or something to keep  those kinds of guys again.” Minako suggestively elbowed the  raven-haired miko.</p>
<p>Rei’s amethyst eyes lit up at this. “Why  not? Would you guys like to come?”</p>
<p>“What? Can we?”  Makoto’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>Now that’s what I call a quick  invitation.</p>
<p>“Sure, I’m allowed my guests as well. My  father is sponsoring it.”</p>
<p>“It might be good for us all to  relax.” Ami said as she considered the prospect.</p>
<p>“I’m in.”  Usagi laughed, her blue eyes sparkling. It was easy to tell what she  was thinking. Looking like a princess while dancing with hot guys  without having to do school work.</p>
<p>“Great, so that means  everyone is coming?”</p>
<p>All the younger girls nodded. I stood  still…until I noticed all eyes were now on me.</p>
<p>“What about  you?” Rei asked.</p>
<p>“No thanks, I’m not good at these sorts  of things.” Actually, I just dislike them. They were nothing but  show back at home, so fake.</p>
<p>“No choice; You. Are. Going.”  Rei spelled it out for me.</p>
<p>“Uhh, but I don’t have anything  to wear.”</p>
<p>I watched the miko ponder the issue; I knew  perfectly well that none of her fancy clothes would fit me. “I know  Ami and Makoto still have almost brand new outfits…but I’m sure  Usagi and Minako would like to purchase something new.” Her eyes  drifted over to her blonde friends who sat at either side of me. They  both got the hint. “I’m SURE they’ll be happy to help  you.”</p>
<p>““NANI!”</p>
<p>“See ya.”</p>
<p>Before I  could blink, two separate pairs of hands clamped around my shoulders.  They were kidnapping me!</p>
<p>“REEEEEEEEEEEI!  I’ll get you for this!”</p>
<p><strong>Tromp! Tromp! Tromp! Tromp!  Tromp!<br />
</strong></p>
<p><u>Shrine room following the exit</u></p>
<p>“Phew.  Well, I guess we won’t be seeing them until later then.” Rei  slapped her hands together for emphasis of a job well done. “You  guys are coming right?” She eyes Ami and Makoto, who didn’t dare  to shake their heads.</p>
<p>“Of course we are.” Makoto nervously  agreed. She sure didn’t want to be on the miko’s bad side that  was for sure.</p>
<p>Amy simple nodded her head.</p>
<p>“Something  wrong Luna? You know you can talk now, Kaiya’s gone.”</p>
<p>“There’s  something odd about that girl.” The dark colored cat muttered.</p>
<p>“What? You must be kidding.” Makoto tried to convince the  cat otherwise. “She’s like everyone else. Right?” She asked  Rei.</p>
<p>“Look, we might be jumping conclusions  here but we’ll leave it till later.” Artemis reasoned. “You  three have your hands full with tonight’s party and it would do you  all good for some relaxation.”</p>
<p>“You two aren’t going?”  Makoto seemed surprised by this; it wasn’t usual for Luna to leave  Usagi along near the drinks.</p>
<p>“We need to conduct an  investigation into this new individual, Rai, as she calls herself.  From what you’ve told us, this could be beyond serious.” Luna  took a breath. “But do not worry, we’ll all deal with this one  step at a time. Meanwhile, enjoy yourselves now.”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s  POV, Park Area</u></p>
<p>“Careful now…” I was aware of the  pair of strong arms that helped me seat myself onto the soft green  grass by the lakeside. Immediately I embraced the anticipated  coolness from both the shade and the cool ground. Simple harmony,  together they provided relief for a hot, mid-afternoon day.</p>
<p>“Really  Ruka, I am not quite so helpless.” I teased the stubborn blonde.  She had been so…what was the word? So…motherly. Yes, that was it.  The thought made me smile inwardly. Ever since she drove me home from  the hospital she had been by my side without fail. Washing the  dishes, watering the plants, changing and folding the laundry…She  hadn’t left to go home during the nights either. Instead she would  hold me while we sat on the coach until I fell asleep.</p>
<p>Waking up to see the  peaceful expression upon her face in the mornings gave me a sense  of…peace. While I was trapped inside myself, I realized that I  missed her more than anything. I was nothing without her…if she  didn’t come for me, I would not be here now.</p>
<p>“Michi?”</p>
<p>“…I  was thinking. I apologize if I worried you.” I offered a  smile.</p>
<p>Ruka took it and smiled back. “It’s no problem.  What were you thinking about anyway? Painting?” She guessed.</p>
<p>I  hesitated momentarily to answer. Painting? My thoughts drifted back  to my unfinished artwork. It was left propped up, covered with a  white veil in my room back at my house. A familiar ache of  incompleteness tugged ever so lightly at my heart. I had tried to  finish the piece various times over the previous days, only each time  my mind came to a mental block. My hand would pose before the canvas,  awaiting the command to dip the brush and begin the end. But I could  not bring myself to do it; there was something uncertain that stopped  me. Was it right? Was this meant to be? The hand would quiver and  shake until I lowered it and covered the work with the veil again.  Perhaps it was for another day.</p>
<p>“No, but it was a good  guess.”</p>
<p>“Not painting huh?”</p>
<p>The tall, masculine  looking woman took a seat beside me. It wasn’t long before she  sighed and rolled onto her back, bringing her arms up to cushion her  head as she fell into her trademark pose. It made me wonder at times  what it must feel like to be so carefree. Not to worry about what  others made of you. In a sense, a part of me wished to be rebellious  and follow Ruka’s lead. I may have too if I were not wearing this  skirt. With that thought one of my hands brushed a few wrinkles from  the blue fabric. My white blouse would surely become dirtied as  well…The price for being a lady.</p>
<p>A calm silence ensued. I  watched as Ruka’s eyes-lids half close, flutter and then entirely  close.</p>
<p>I continued to stare across the water, becoming  increasing lost in my thoughts. I knew I had the tendency to  daydream… I was also acutely aware of when my mind would begin to  wander. However, now it didn’t bother me in the least. All I wished  was to think about us, between Ruka and myself…</p>
<p>We were  always together, ever since we were children. Perhaps… we still  are. Every new day in life brings us new surprises. Such as the day I  met Ruka…the time discovered I was Sailor Neptune and on that  significant stormy night when I met Kaiya.</p>
<p>I gathered my  hands on my lap, noticing the bareness of them. The sight brought  back fond childhood wishes. When I was younger, before my father  died, I always imagined myself growing up to have a husband and  children; having a family of my own. Is it not every girl’s dream  to stand at the altar and receive the ring from your most cherished  love? I thought it would forever be my one dream…</p>
<p>Another  cool breeze ran across the watery surface before me, where I saw my  reflection become distorted from the ripples. It slowed and then  returned to peace again.</p>
<p>The person in that reflection is not  the same little girl that once was. I am not so blind that I can  finally see that. Things have changed. I’ve changed, Ruka’s  changed, our home has changed…But…despite all that, I’ve found  that person. Only now do I see how foolish it was to be looking for  someone who has been with me all this time.</p>
<p>If only she felt  the same way…</p>
<p>“Ruka, are you  asleep?” I inquired my companion. She made no movement.</p>
<p>I  bent forward to study her face, wondering whether it was an act. As I  did so, I instead noticed the small beads of sweat beginning to form  upon her brow. The suit she was wearing must be making her very warm  I realized. If she isn’t careful she could over heat. I waited to  see whether Ruka would fix the problem. It wouldn’t take  much…unbuttoning the collar would do plenty. Another few minutes  rolled by but nothing.</p>
<p>Was she really asleep?</p>
<p>“Oh  Ruka…” I chided. As my hands made to do the work for her, I felt  my face grow unbearably warm. It’s… nothing, I told myself.  Right…? Oh, I’m being silly.</p>
<p>I softly shook my head and  continued. My nails brushed the brown button before my finger gently  grasped their target. Never had I thought such a task would prove to  be so difficult to do! I was conscious of every detail. My breathing,  the shakiness of my motions, how I tried not to wake the sleeping  woman as I shifted positions…</p>
<p>My heart skipped a beat as  Ruka snorted. It took a lot not to giggle at her expense, however I  did permit myself to smile. Her action had only startled me for a  moment but it had not deterred my resolution to carry forward. The  first button was undone in a matter of minutes, and the second in  seconds to my amazement- already I had grown so bold. It was not like  me. Not so much lady-like my inner voice warned me.</p>
<p>Absent-mindedly  my hands slipped further down. My inner turmoil prodded me forward  until I heard,</p>
<p>“Getting a little low aren’t we?” Caught  red faced and handed, my hands shot back in utter embarrassment.</p>
<p>“…You looked a little warm and it was a hot day out…”  I tried to justify.</p>
<p>Ruka raised an eyebrow and pushed herself  up to a sitting position. She then examined her jacket, which had  been entirely undone. Then to her shirt where only two beside the  collar had been seen my work. As she did so, I felt my eyes widen at  the sight, taking it all in for the first time. I never meant to go  this far.</p>
<p>“Uh huh.” Ruka rolled her eyes with disbelief in  her voice. My eyes averted her gaze, suddenly pretending to being  interested in something across the lake. I could feel her eyes bore  into me, willing me to meet them but I resisted; I could not. I heard  her shuffle positions, perking my interest; what was she doing now?</p>
<p>A warm hand cupped my cheek and I could not resist any  longer. Dark green eyes met mine. Inside I battled between breaking  her contact and backing up or to stay very still. The thoughts were  interrupted when Ruka bent forward, making me freeze. She  wouldn’t…would she? I thought back to that one time in the park,  surely bringing a blush across my features. Although this time, I  don’t think I would have minded.</p>
<p>“You want me don’t  you?” She whispered in a husky voice. Her free hand moved down to  the remaining buttons on her shirt suggestively.</p>
<p>Amidst the  close contact my mind reeled. Was she flirting for real or on  purpose? I automatically assumed the latter; there was no way she  could feel that way about me. If she did I would…Besides, she  flirts with girls all the time!</p>
<p>“Stop playing games.” I  breathed, trying my best to keep my exterior calm and collected.</p>
<p>I  expected her to laugh, to pull back and begin the melodramatics with  her usual teasing attitude. Instead, Ruka bit her bottom lip, her  gaze breaking mine for a split second.</p>
<p>What was…?</p>
<p>“Michi…I…”</p>
<p>The wind rustled  through the tree branches above. She stopped again, as if she were  looking for the right words.</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>“What is  it?” I gently prodded. Her nervous demeanor sent an uneasy feeling  through my stomach. I watched Ruka stand up and shake her head, turn  her back to me while mumbling, “…not good at this…” Bringing  me to greater confusion. Good at what?</p>
<p>By now, the blonde  woman was pacing around. With no other explanation at hand, I  concluded the heat had gotten to my partner.</p>
<p>“How about we  visit the mall?” I asked out of the blue.</p>
<p>Ruka paused, then  turned on the spot with a surprised expression upon her face.  “W-what?”</p>
<p>“The mall.” I repeated with slight  amusement. “…Or is there something you would like to tell me?”</p>
<p>Ruka’s face paled, making me sigh inwardly. “I’m not  certain what you wish to tell me, but if you’re having this much  difficulty, perhaps it would be best to tell me later?” I watched  green eyes relax considerably at this statement. “Would that be all  right?”</p>
<p>I heard the recognizable agreeing grunt.  “Yeah…maybe. But I will tell you today for sure! Promise.”</p>
<p>I  nodded. “Then shall we go?”</p>
<p>I waited for Ruka to extend  her arm as usual, however, I was surprised when the taller woman held  out her hand instead. I watched the outstretched palm carefully,  unsure of what to do.</p>
<p>“It’s better if I held onto you.”  She grinned. “Can’t have Michi losing her grace and falling.”</p>
<p>“You’re so…” I paused. Now what was the word? ‘Mean?’</p>
<p>“So…? H-HEY!” She wrestled out of my grasp. “Owww…why  do you keep pinching my cheeks?”</p>
<p>I ignored her indignation  and offered out my own hand. “We cannot have Ruka bad mouthing  others can we?” A smile naturally came to my face.</p>
<p>“…”  She seemed to stare.</p>
<p>“Something the matter?”</p>
<p>“…N-no,  it’s nothing. Let’s just go.” She took my hand in hers and we  both began our way to the shopping center.</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’  POV, Shopping center</u></p>
<p>“So where do we start?” Usagi  suddenly spoke up.</p>
<p>The three of us stared down a long  corridor with shops lined up at either side. There were shops  everywhere! Ahh! What’s with people and shopping?</p>
<p>“Any  places with a sale going on?” She continued.</p>
<p>“Nope, so I  guess we can just leave.” I cheerful suggested. Personally, I  disliked shopping; Michiru dragged Haruka and me once on this six  hour shopping spree. Guess who had to carry all the packages? No, it  wasn’t me thank Kami, but Haruka…ouch. I winced at the memory.  Without Haruka to pile the packages on, I’m screwed. Absolutely  S-C-R-E-W-E-D.</p>
<p>Minako narrowed her eyes, erasing all hope I  had of escaping. Although I hadn’t known the sugar high teen for a  long, any logical person could plainly see what was racing through  her mind.</p>
<p>“What do we do now?” ‘Bunny’ whined to ‘Mina  chan’. I mentally slapped my head; I can’t BELIEVE she said  that!</p>
<p>“As the shopping expert, I say we should not wait for  a sale to shop. Oh, no! A true shopping fan knows shopping is  appropriate at any time! Think about it Usagi.” The girl wrapped a  free arm around her ‘prey’. “This is for the greater good of  human kind. Our money will stimulate the economy, providing jobs to  all…”</p>
<p>As the sales pitch continued, I sweat dropped. What  the…? Is Minako really dumb or is it all an act? The girl is  spewing economics for peeks sake!</p>
<p>Blah, blah, blah…  “Besides, we still need new dresses! Ooooo, let’s check this  place!” She suddenly snapped back into her ditzy mode. “Let’s  go!”</p>
<p>Before I could blink I felt a hand clamp down on my  wrist, dragging me off to some unknown destination. Someone SAAAAAAVE  ME!</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s POV, shopping mall</u></p>
<p><u></u>Damn,  I missed my chance! Stupid, stupid, stupid! If there were an  available wall I’d smack my head against it without a second  thought.</p>
<p>“…” ARRRGH!</p>
<p>Michi gave me a worried  glance. “It’s nothing.” I mumbled. The shorter woman continued  to give me that look, forcing me to turn away quickly; anything to  avoid those eyes!</p>
<p>“Ah…so, anything you’d like to do in  particular?” I tried to change the subject.</p>
<p>Michiru looked  thoughtful. “Well…We do need more bandages; I think we’ve used  quite a few up over the past few weeks.”</p>
<p>I frowned at this.  “Don’t you think we should put this one hold? I mean…” I  leaned forwards and whispered, “Saving the world is good and fine,  but we need to relax sometimes too!”</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>“One  day can’t hurt!” I continued to persuade my companion. “Pick  something fun, whatever you’d like to do. Even…” I gulped.  “Shopping.”</p>
<p>Michiru raised her eyebrow at this. Erm… “I  know, wouldn’t you like to go to that café we tried last  time? Didn’t you like it?”</p>
<p>The aqua haired woman nodded.  “So why don’t we check it?” I grabbed her hand and started to  pull her towards our new destination.</p>
<p>“R-Ruka!”</p>
<p>…Perhaps  shopping would be over doing it right now.</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s  POV, inside a store</u></p>
<p>“Does this dress make me look  fat?”</p>
<p>I tiredly looked up at Minako’s twelfth outfit. It  was…orange. With flowers. And…Damn my eyes hurt! Why do they all  have to be such blinding colors?</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“WHAT!”  She shrieked. Horror became evident as her face paled significantly.  Immediately she ran back into the dressing stall where frantic  movements could be heard.</p>
<p><strong>SLAM!</strong></p>
<p>“I didn’t  think it looked that bad.” Usagi was by my side now.</p>
<p>Who  knows? They all looked the same to me.</p>
<p>“If you say so.” I  shrugged. “Oh, “ I eyed the article of clothing clasped in her  hands, “…did you want my opinion on that too?”</p>
<p>“Umm…no  thanks.” She waved. “I’ll wait for Mina chan.”</p>
<p>Mental  note to self: if you do a bad enough job they will NEVER ask you  again. I grinned at this; the faster we get this over with, the  sooner I can look for Haruka and Michiru!</p>
<p>“Okay! HOW’S  THIS!” Minako charged out again with another orange  ensemble.</p>
<p>Only…some people never get the hint. I  twitched.</p>
<p>“Are you kidding me? It makes you look like a  pumpkin.” I responded with a bored look.</p>
<p>Minako crossed her  arms and began to tap her foot in an irritated manner. Any minute now  she’ll surely explode. Annnnnny minute now. I watched her face form  into her trademark thinking frown.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe you.”  She finally remarked.</p>
<p>“It’s your dress, do whatever you  want; you don’t have to take my opinion into account. Baka blonde.”  I quickly added.</p>
<p>“You’re blonde too.”</p>
<p>“So? At  least I’m not a baka, baka blonde.”</p>
<p>“I have a name you  know!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s baka-“</p>
<p>“Shut up!” A  strong punch suddenly knocked me off my chair.</p>
<p>She hit me! I  blinked from the floor up at the ceiling. “Take that Rei!” Minako  bellowed as she loomed over me.</p>
<p>If there was time for any,  this was one sure awkward moment. Unfortunately it was broken by  Usagi’s uncontrollable laughter.</p>
<p>“Ah…No, that wasn’t…”  Baka blonde coughed. Her face was a deep shade of red now.</p>
<p>“Rei  huh?” I raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Yeah!” Usagi interrupted  with a snort. “Rei! That’s what it reminded me of!” I watched  the klutzy girl wobbly walked in a circle, trying hard to fall over  right there. She held her stomach while managing a, ‘She even  guessed that nickname too!”</p>
<p>“Nickname?” Minako stepped  back as I picked myself off the floor. The blow still burned on my  face. “Is there something you aren’t telling us?” I prodded. It  smelled like opportunity of sweet revenge. “What this about a  nickname Usagi?”</p>
<p>The younger girl finally calmed down  through a series of deep breaths, which appeared to be like deep  gulps if anything. “Well, whenever Rei and I get into fights, Rei  calls me Odango. With Minako, it’s…”</p>
<p>“…Baka blonde.”  I finished. My eyes wandered over to the pile of dresses in the  corner inside the stale…and then to the clock. Twelve dresses, one  hour. Ah…I see. “You wanted to impress her didn’t you baka  blonde?”</p>
<p>“She figured it out Mina chan…” Minako shot  her ‘twin’ a glare. “No! I didn’t tell her.”</p>
<p>Baka  blonde stood there, unwilling to speak. “Hmph.”</p>
<p>For a  moment, I thought I saw a bit of Haruka in her. The way she would  seem to deny her own feelings. It made me wonder…</p>
<p>“Hey,  what do you think of love?”</p>
<p>I immediately had Minako’s  attention, probably because I used her actual name.</p>
<p>“What?”  She blinked. The expression upon her face indicated that she thought  my question was some joke.</p>
<p>“Yeah, what do you think of  love?” I repeated myself. “A friend of mine needs some  advice.”</p>
<p>Minako broadly grinned. “You came to the right  person! I just happen to be an ‘expert’. What kind of trouble are  we talking here?”</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s Pov, café</u></p>
<p>Okay,  I breathed. So far so good; we somehow had gotten seats…waitress  should come take our orders soon…My arms gripped the sides of my  chair, almost afraid to let go. The thought of telling Michiru today  was torturously unbearable. Unlike myself Michi was quietly sipping  her drink from across the table, appearing to be completely relaxed.  So…unfair. A twinge of jealously poked my side.</p>
<p>No,  can’t…think…about that. Frantically my mind was racing to find  something to help ease my stress.</p>
<p>“So…everything is  alright?” I asked my companion.</p>
<p>Michi nodded, but not yet  meeting my eyes. She was absorbed into something on the menu.</p>
<p>“Have  you decided what you want to order?” This time the beauty shook her  head.</p>
<p>Did I do something wrong? Why isn’t she looking at  me? Crap, she doesn’t know does she? I felt my eyes widen. No! She  couldn’t, I haven’t…erm…My mind went blank. There must be  some way of getting her attention.</p>
<p>“Hello, may I take your  order?”</p>
<p>Bingo.</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV, store</u></p>
<p><u></u>“I  heard that sometimes flirting can inspire jealously from your crush.  What do you think of that method?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Definitely  not.”</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s POV, café</u></p>
<p>“Why  yes, actually I’d like it if…” I threw my ‘flirtatious’  smile. The waitress, perhaps a few years younger than I was, blushed  furiously at the attention.</p>
<p>“If…w-what?” She  squeaked.</p>
<p>“Ahem.” Michi coughed. Cold aqua eyes laid upon  me, eliciting a VERY cold shiver down my spine. Uhh…My mind froze  with fear; she doesn’t look very happy. “If you would give us a  few ‘miss’.”</p>
<p>The young girl deeply bowed and skittered  off.</p>
<p>“Now Haruka…”</p>
<p>Uh oh…</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s  POV, store</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Sometimes that can backfire, you might  make your crush more angry than jealous.”</p>
<p>“I see…But if  it was by accident?”</p>
<p>“By accident?” Minako frowned.  “What do you mean? Something stupid like accidentally spilling  water or looking like a klutz? That’s perfectly normal you  know.”</p>
<p>“No, I mean…”</p>
<p>Usagi finished my sentence  for me, “Like spilling water over your crush while they’re  wearing a white shirt?”</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s POV,  café</u></p>
<p><u></u><strong>SLAP!</strong></p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV,  store</u></p>
<p><u></u>“You’re screwed.” Minako put it  simply.</p>
<p>“Pretty much.” Usagi agreed with her ‘twin’.</p>
<p>If  they both agreed, then it must be true. My thoughts wandered back to  Haruka. Hopefully she won’t botch things up when her and Michiru go  out. When were they going out anyway?</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>“I  mean, it won’t be the end of the world necessarily.” Minako added  to her previous comment. “There are ways to redeem yourself.”</p>
<p>…I  turned my head sideways, revealing the small red mark on my cheek and  pointed to the spot. “You mean for stuff like THIS?”</p>
<p>“No,  you deserved that.” My attacker smirked. “I meant stuff like  ‘turning down all my outfits on purpose’.”</p>
<p>Ehhh? She  figured it out?</p>
<p>A different thought suddenly flashed through  my mind. Now it was my turn to grin. “What about keeping secrets? I  think dear Rei chan has a right to know.”</p>
<p>The expression on  baka blonde’s face was priceless. “Don’t even think about it.”  She warned.</p>
<p>“Hey guys…” Usagi mumbled. Her hand was  hovering over her squinted eyes, as though she was in need of  glasses. In response I turned with curious as to what had perked her  interest.</p>
<p>“What are you guys looking at?” Baka blonde  inquired…which was a good question; all I saw were crowds of  walking people.</p>
<p>“I thought I saw Michiru.”</p>
<p>“Michiru!”  Both Baka Blonde and I yelled.</p>
<p>I ran out of the store and  scanned down on side of the crowd, then at its backside. “Are you  sure?”</p>
<p>“It’s hard to miss anyone like her…” Came the  response.</p>
<p>My eyes ran up and down for a few seconds longer  before I caught the shock of aqua colored hair. Michir-I paused. The  person was sporting what looked to be a gold suit top. Did Michiru  ever wear stuff like that? I can’t remember but I was pretty sure  she didn’t. That was more of Haruka’s style. Hmm…Automatically  my foot took a step forward but stopped with another uncertainty; if  it was Michiru, then where was Haruka? Wasn’t she supposed to take  care of her?</p>
<p><strong>Tup! Tup! Tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Kaiya wait  up!” The two younger girls called after me.</p>
<p>“Michiru! Hey,  Michiru!” I called, ignoring the other two. Resounding footsteps  trailed my own.</p>
<p>Ahead of me, the person had stopped and  peered around. When they turned around I felt relief flood through  me; it was Michiru!</p>
<p>“Michiru, over here!” Her eyes  finally found my fast approaching form.</p>
<p><strong>Tup, tup, tup…tup,  tup.</strong></p>
<p>“Hey…” I breathed, slightly out of breath as I  reached her.</p>
<p>She gave a small smile, “A little out of  breath?” She teased. The rare comment left a warm glow inside.</p>
<p>Maybe asking would be alright after all; she seems to be in a  good mood.</p>
<p>“Sorta.” I admitted. “…Where’s  Haruka?”</p>
<p>“I don’t see her around…Aren’t  you still recovering?” A hint of worry left my voice. It wasn’t a  good idea for Michiru to be wandering around without someone with  her. What if she collapsed? ‘Simple’, a voice inside retorted,  ‘I’d kill Haruka’. “…Did something bad happen? And why are  you wearing that suit top?” The piece of clothing was extremely  baggy on her slim figure.</p>
<p>Michiru opened her mouth but no  words came out. She tried once more but to no avail. Instead, a sigh  finally succeeded in escaping my weary friend. “No,” She shook  her head. “Nothing of the sort. It’s just…”</p>
<p><strong>Thud!</strong></p>
<p>A  red ribbon…My mind mused automatically as the color blinded my  sight momentarily.</p>
<p>“Kaiya!” The voice accused. “…Sheesh,  don’t take off like that!” Baka blonde barged in. Usagi panted  for breath by her twin’s side.</p>
<p>“Yeah…” Usagi panted.  “Oh… hello Michiru.” She greeted the senior. She then leaned in  and closed the distance between to whisper, “I told you I saw her.”  A large smile and a nudge into my side soon followed.</p>
<p>…Anyway!  “You really shouldn’t barge into other people’s conversations  Minako,” I addressed the shorter girl. “Michiru was about to tell  me something important.”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Minako’s jaw  dropped. “W-What did you say?”</p>
<p>“You really  shouldn’t…”</p>
<p>“No! I mean, why are you being all nice  now!” She practically shouted. Inwardly I grinned.</p>
<p>“What  do you mean?”</p>
<p>Baka blonde’s eyes narrowed suspiciously.  “I mean…while we were clothes shopping you-” I still shot her  the ‘what are you talking about?’ smile. “YOU LITTLE-”</p>
<p>“Give  it up Mina chan…” Rabbit whined.</p>
<p>You could really see  the smoke and fire coming now. Many people may have dropped to their  knees and start apologizing by now but I chuckled; let that be a  lesson to you. Never…drag me shopping. No one will be spared my  wraith! Well, unless you’re Michiru. Now <em>she</em> can be  scary!</p>
<p>Speaking of which…I turned my attention back to the  woman, “What were you saying?”</p>
<p>“Haruka is at that new  café that opened up a few weeks ago. I was on my way to the  female restrooms; apparently the place still hasn’t finished their  own.”</p>
<p>Okay, that makes sense. At least Haruka was around.  The fact eased up my worrying somewhat. “And the suit? I’m  assuming it belongs to our loud mouthed friend waiting for you at the  café?”</p>
<p>Michiru made an affirmative nod. Before I  could ask the next logical question of ‘why’, Michiru continued  to say, “We had an accident; she knocked over her glass of  water.”</p>
<p>I was staring at the woman in front on me now. The  suit…</p>
<p>“…On you?” Baka blonde bluntly guessed.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately so.”</p>
<p>“Michiru, you aren’t  wearing a white shirt by any chance?” Usagi asked what was going  through all our heads now.</p>
<p>In response, a red blush appeared  across her features. Her eyes quickly averted my own as emotions of  masked embarrassment started to creep through her weakening façade.</p>
<p>Shit! Haruka, you idiot! I wanted to march over there right  now and yell my lungs out at that…Suddenly the wind died out of me,  another rational thought had to intervene with my destructive  attitude. What…was Haruka feeling right now? I know she has  feelings for Michiru, but does Michiru know? It didn’t look like  Michiru was angry and I don’t think she was going to walk out on  Haruka over something this small…</p>
<p>I took a deep breath,  guess it’s up to ‘us’.</p>
<p>“Gimme a sec Michiru.”</p>
<p>I  wrapped my arms over Baka blonde and Rabbit’s shoulders, drawing us  three into a close huddle and out of ear range.</p>
<p>“That’s…really  gotta suck.” Usagi immediately sympathized with Haruka.</p>
<p>“But  being that klutzy to begin with? Hey, these aren’t the times for  it, especially when it involves trying to impress your crush.”  Minako followed up.</p>
<p>I gave her a funny look, “How did you  know Haruka like Michiru?” I know I didn’t tell her!</p>
<p>“Anyone  can tell.” Was the quick response.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>It still  sounded funny to me, but whatever. “So you guys in?”</p>
<p>“You  bet!” They both gave the thumbs up affirmative.</p>
<p>“Take care  of Haruka ‘kay? I’ll go with Michiru and meet you guys back over  there soon.”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“Break!” We all  laughed.</p>
<p>“Come on Michiru,” I wrapped one arm around the  smaller woman, aiming to avert her attention away from the quickly  disappearing blonde agents.</p>
<p>“What-”</p>
<p>“Restrooms  right?” I bent down a little to whisper, “I’ll help keep the  cover from falling.” This top was just too baggy!</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s  POV, restrooms, ten minutes later</u></p>
<p><u></u><br />
  “Michiru, which  stall are you in?” I heard Kaiya call out. She was kind enough to  offer to buy me a replacement shirt. Although I wished to provide the  necessary money, she continually refused it.</p>
<p>“The third from  the left.” I waved my hand up over the stall for emphasis.</p>
<p>“See  you.” I felt soft fabric make contact with my open palm and  instinctively my hand closed down on the gift.</p>
<p>“Thank you.  I’m sorry to have bothered you.”</p>
<p>“It’s no problem.”  Kaiya casually replied. “Does it fit?”</p>
<p>I opened the  fabric to its full length to see it properly. It was an absolutely  stunning black blouse. How much did she pay for it? It must have been  expensive! I debated over offering to pay her back once more or even  hand it back but I realized I could not. The money issue was an issue  I knew I could not win; if the recipient would not accept it, then it  was pointless…even if it was from a friend, accepting something  such as this felt like taking advantage of her. However, if I  returned it to her, Kaiya would surely be offended. I could see the  head strong blonde ask, ‘what’s wrong with it?’ Which the  answer would be ‘nothing’.</p>
<p>I inwardly groaned and  reluctantly fitted it on.</p>
<p>“It’s a perfect fit. Thank you.”  I thanked her once more. I was about to exit the stall when Kaiya  suddenly asked,</p>
<p>“Hey Michiru? What do you think about  Haruka?”</p>
<p>I almost fell over from shock. “Think what of  Haruka? What do you mean?” I tried to keep my voice steady.</p>
<p>“Do  you like her?”</p>
<p>…She couldn’t be implying romantically  could she? What should I say? I…I do like Ruka but can I tell Kaiya  that? The thought of losing a good friend made me nervous.</p>
<p>“Are  you coming out?”</p>
<p>That much I could do. I opened the  bathroom door and walked out, showing off the shirt as I did  so.</p>
<p>Kaiya smiled, “It looks good. Oh and can I see your  hand for a second?”</p>
<p>“My hand? What for?” The request  puzzled me but I saw no reason to object.</p>
<p>Kaiya took my hand  and turned it over till its open palm stared back at her face. A  strange tickling sensation inside developed almost instantly. Unsure  of what else to do, I looked up where Kaiya’s aqua eyes met my own.  I felt the feeling inside build, causing myself to briefly panic; it  was almost as though invisible threads were probing into my soul. The  room to my eyesight darkened slightly, allowing me to see what was  happening. Other than my aquamarine aura there was another unknown  signature but I could not determine it’s true color. White light  was all I saw…and they were being emitted from…</p>
<p>“…Thanks.”  Kaiya broke our contact. Her eyes briefly glanced away, appearing to  be in deep thought.</p>
<p>What did I see? When I tried to read her  aura I could not, their energy was unstable so much…that it felt  like I was witnessing a raging battle.</p>
<p>There’s something  strange about you…</p>
<p>“I…I do like her.” I admitted. I  waited for the possible shocked expressions from Kaiya but none came.</p>
<p>“I see.” The teen nodded. A warm smile lit her face,  easing my own tense heart. She accepted it like that? “Are you  surprised?” Kaiya asked.</p>
<p>“If this is who  you are, then I’ll accept it. I’ll be here for you as long as I  can.”</p>
<p>Like a true friend, I thought. It felt like something  of our bond has solidified just then. She said she’d always be here  for me, even after learning this side to me. Although her strange  aura startled me, I still believe that I can trust her, now more than  ever.</p>
<p>That is why, I have to ask.</p>
<p>“Is something  wrong?”</p>
<p>“Wrong?” She mouthed. “No, not at all. Why do  you ask?”</p>
<p>Your aura…I felt disappointed that she would  refuse to tell me her problems but perhaps she’s not ready yet. I  would like to know who you are…the real you.</p>
<p>“If you ever  should need someone to talk to, I’m always here for you.” I told  the taller teen.</p>
<p>“…Sounds good.” She grinned.</p>
<p>We  both began our way out of the restrooms.</p>
<p>“So tell me, how  much do you like Haruka?”</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s  POV, café</u></p>
<p><u></u>I continued to stare out at the  empty seat where Michi occupied only minutes before. How did this  happen? I remember stretching out to cup the glass…Then Michi  started to talk to me…Oh. The memory came all too clearly now; I  was looking too intently at her beautiful face, hanging on her every  word…while forgetting I was still reaching out for that glass!  Damn! AND THEN, my hand bumped into it instead of grabbing it,  spilling it all over her!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>ARGH!</p>
<p>I  gripped both sides of the table and prepared to bring my head  crashing down onto the wooden top. My motions were abruptly stopped  when a sharp tapping hit my shoulders. I looked up, expecting it to  be another waitress, but instead I saw…them.</p>
<p>“Not a good  idea.” Minako shook her finger in my face. I hate that!</p>
<p>I  leaned back, wracking my already abused brains when Usagi said  something odd “It’s okay, we’re here to help.”</p>
<p>Help?</p>
<p>What  on earth were they yammering on about?</p>
<p>“Confused?” Minako  gloated again.</p>
<p>Well no shit.</p>
<p>“Look,  this is time for redemption! NOT self pity.”</p>
<p>“And you want  to help?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.” Usagi joined in.</p>
<p>“…No  thanks.”</p>
<p>“What!”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>To my  irritating they swiped the seats across from me and began their nosy  instigations. I was not in the mood for this.</p>
<p>“I don’t  need your help.”</p>
<p>I watched the two younger girls exchange  glances.</p>
<p>“Are you sure about that?” Minako narrowed her  eyes. It was as though she didn’t believe a word I said.</p>
<p>“Of  course. Without a doubt.” I hope…</p>
<p>“Sure, just like when  you spilled your drink all over Michiru.”</p>
<p>How did they know?  The sequence of torturous events began to unfold before my eyes again  but I shook my head violently to bat away the evil images.</p>
<p>“We just…wanted to  help.” Usagi’s eyes started to tear. The waterworks! Oh shit! If  she gets on a roll who knows what people will think.</p>
<p>I then  grudgingly gave in. “What do you suggest?” It was a good thing  Kaiya didn’t know about this or I’d never hear the end of it.</p>
<p>The two across from me gave each other a ‘v’ for victory,  grinning broadly. Only one question still remained, just why were  they being so persistent to help?</p>
<p>“Yikes, here they  come!”</p>
<p>Who? I turned in time to see Kaiya waving goodbye to  Michiru at the entrance of the café. No…I felt myself pale.  Does Kaiya know? Relief spread through me as the two parted; I  definitely did not want to see her so soon. The realization that  Michiru was coming this way made my gaze shoot back to the empty  seats across from me.</p>
<p>“Hey-” What…? Both seats were now  empty with no Usagi or Minako in sight!</p>
<p>Now where did those  little scamps rush off to? I lifted my new drink up to my mouth and  took a slow sip. Maybe…far away from here I silently hoped.</p>
<p><strong>Tup,  tup, tup.</strong></p>
<p>My train of thought was broken with the  approaching footsteps. Without even looking up, I could tell it was  Michiru. It’s crazy, I know, but I’ve always been able to  identify the familiar sound her shoes always make.</p>
<p><strong>Tup,  tup.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“I’m back.”</p>
<p>She stood there in front of  me without a hint of anger that I expected. It really…made me  wonder.</p>
<p>“Oh!” I stood up suddenly- the chair! “Here,”  I pulled one chair back for her and motioned to her with my free  hand.</p>
<p>There was no hesitation. “Thank you.” She  graciously took her seat.</p>
<p>In turn I nodded and walked over to  my own once more, feeling the urge to rush into it and hide my face.  Actions aren’t everything you know; words can hurt much more, I  silently reminded myself. After I reached my destination my hands  immediately began to fumble nervously in my lap…under the table.  Where Michiru wouldn’t see them.</p>
<p>“So…” I tried, unsure  of how to start a simple conversation. The feeling of the recent  screw up still bothered me. It was the equivalence of slapping  yourself silly for some sanity! “I see you got a new  shirt.”</p>
<p>…Okaaaay, awkward silence here.</p>
<p><strong>SplOOsh!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Gah!”  I yelled, jumping up onto my feet. C-cold! My mind screamed.  Partially shaking and freezing, I glared down at a blonde waiter.  Wait…I looked this ‘guy’ up and down. The person was dressed in  a male waiter’s uniform but something seemed off here.</p>
<p>“Ah,  so sorry about that sir. It was an accident, my hand slip.” A pair  of gleaming aqua eyes laughed back.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to  shout ‘Kaiya!’ the ‘guy’ quickly added, “Your waitresses  will be with you in one moment. Thank you for your patience!” H-Hey  now…I watched Kaiya leave quickly, her small ponytail bobbing up  and around the corner where two different people walked out.</p>
<p>“Thank  you for waiting!” Both shouted at once in high-pitched voices.  Wait, SO THAT’S WHERE THEY WENT! The horror…A sinking feeling  told me to run while I had the chance, but Michiru seemed to have  other plans.</p>
<p>She smiled at the two blonde waitresses. “Hello.  Would it possible to order the special of the day?”</p>
<p>“Why  of course!” Usagi scribbled the item onto a note pad.</p>
<p>“And  what about you sir?” Minako shoved her pen into my face.</p>
<p>‘Watch  it’, I almost shouted in surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Whack!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Kaiya  was back.</p>
<p>“Now, now, please treat the customer with  respect.” She scolded Minako…or at least I think she was trying  to; it was difficult to tell, she was grinning from ear to ear. If I  didn’t know better, she was struggling to keep herself from  laughing outright. “Gomen ne miss,” She directed her attention to  my companion. “They’re new.”</p>
<p>“I see.” Michiru  giggled.</p>
<p>Hey, I’m the one still wet here!</p>
<p>“Ah, you  still haven’t dried off?” I heard Kaiya muse. Great, she was  talking again.</p>
<p>“In two minutes? From a jug of freezing ice  water?” I sarcastically mumbled, knowing full well she was asking  for it.”</p>
<p>“Ruka.”</p>
<p>“Hm? A-AH!” Another  pinch!</p>
<p>Michiru was smiling as she released her hold.  “Unfortunately this is how she usually acts. Please excuse  her.”</p>
<p>You don’t have to apologize to HER!</p>
<p>I was  fuming now. “Would you <em>please</em> excuse me? I need to use the  restroom.” I stood up to leave. As expected the trio of doom  immediately stalked me. When I rounded the corner out of sight I  turned on them.</p>
<p>“Okay, what are you doing!”</p>
<p>“Helping.”  They all cheerfully responded. Funny, they’re all so short too. If  someone walks in here they would either conclude, ‘a bunch of dumb  blondes bickering things out’ or two, ‘a big bully threatening  small kids’. That’s why I hate being so tall all the time, you’re  always accused as the aggressor. I sweat dropped remembering Usagi  fake tears. “Besides, you said we could.”</p>
<p>That snapped me  out of my thoughts, “I said what?”</p>
<p>Usagi’s eyes started  to tear again.</p>
<p>“Okay! Okay!” I groaned and rolled my eyes.  “Just…don’t cry.”</p>
<p>“So from now on if you say  something stupid you’ll get it.” Kaiya poked my nose.</p>
<p>Ow…I  rubbed the inflicted area. “Get what?”</p>
<p>“Anything we can  throw.” Her eyes seemed to slowly shift over to the pile of chairs  stacked behind us.</p>
<p>“Here.” Minako shoved  something hard into my hands.</p>
<p>“A…walkie talkie?” I then  realized how stupid I just sounded. Apparently everyone else noticed  it immediately and laughed.</p>
<p>Grr…I bit my bottom lip.</p>
<p>“No,  it’s a cell phone.” They laughed again. Strangle, or not to  strangle? “Ha…ha…anyway, we came up with code names so Michiru  won’t know. Usagi is Rabbit, Kaiya is Kay, and I’m-“</p>
<p>“Baka  blonde.”</p>
<p>“What? No I’m not!” Kaiya and Minako began to  argue.</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“Because.”</p>
<p>“Because?”</p>
<p>“You  know, I think the name fits.” I broke the  tie.</p>
<p>“…HA!”</p>
<p>“…FINE! Now if  you excuse me, I have an order to attend.” Baka blonde marched away  to the kitchens. Usagi shortly followed. “See ya Haruka. Mina chan,  wait up!”</p>
<p><strong>Tup, tup , tup.</strong></p>
<p>Leaving me with  Kaiya. Huh…</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going  too?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“What?”  I said more forcefully as I moved to grip her uniform collar. The  serious expression on her face didn’t suit her at all! “What is  it?”</p>
<p>“…Game. Plan.”</p>
<p>I blinked and let go.  “Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“Movie, two hours, outside the crown  arcade. You my friend will tell her. Today. Because if you don’t,  someone will take her away from you.”</p>
<p>“I know  but…”</p>
<p>“But?”</p>
<p>“There are some complications…I  want to tell her but I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Don’t know about  what? What’s the problem.”</p>
<p>I sighed. I guess I shouldn’t’  expect Kaiya to understand off the bat. “I mean, she’s just too  perfect. Sometimes it feels like I’m not good enough. She might be  happier with someone else.” There, I said it. I admit I have  insecurities too. Now all I had to do was wait for the roar of  laughter sure to follow.</p>
<p>Kaiya blinked. “Who should be the  one to decide that?” She crossed her arms. “It’s Michiru’s  choice, not yours.”</p>
<p>“But-”</p>
<p>“Listen to me! If  the person truly loves you, it should be for your heart, not for what  you do. Status, money, fame, forget all that shit! Do you love  her?”</p>
<p>Of course I do! “Yes.”</p>
<p>“Then…” Kaiya  took in a deep breath. “That’s all that matters. If you don’t  ask you will never know.” She now gripped both of my shoulders.  “You have to take a chance for what matters the most to you. At  least be able to say that you gave it all, not to regret the ‘what  ifs’.”</p>
<p>Were we even talking about love advice? Her eyes  seemed to be distant as she said the last few sentences.</p>
<p>As I  digested the information she broke her steady state and smacked the  back of my head.</p>
<p>“Come on, don’t look so serious!” <strong>Whack! </strong>“It’s not you.”<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Kaiya!” I  growled.</p>
<p>“See ya later!”</p>
<p><strong>Tup, tup,  tup!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Michiru’s POV, café</u></p>
<p><u></u>I  wonder what is taking Ruka so long? I peered down at my watch. She’s  been gone ten minutes now…I didn’t think she drank that much.  Then again, she did run off at a fast pace.</p>
<p>As I contemplated  the various possibilities they were all cut short as my companion  rounded about the very same corner she had vanished around  earlier.</p>
<p>“Back?” I smiled.</p>
<p>The other woman seemed  to shrug off my greeting and mumbled something rather incoherent.</p>
<p>“Ruka?” I inquired once more. “Is something  wrong?”</p>
<p>“H-Huh? Oh, it’s nothing. Sorry…” She turned  her head.</p>
<p>Out of the corner of my eye I could see the people  walk by, being followed by Ruka’s dark green eyes. She seemed deep  in thought. Should I say something? The uneasy feeling began to grow  in my stomach, making it flip flop uncomfortably. Did she still feel  guilty about the accident earlier?</p>
<p>“About earlier…”</p>
<p>Her  eyes darted back to mine and I noticed it. Having her entire  attention on me. I liked it…</p>
<p>I shook my head lightly,  determined to push forward. “I’m not angry.” For a moment I  could have sworn I heard Ruka sigh a breath of relief. Other than  that she made no other movement, her eyes still watching my own.</p>
<p>I  could never stay angry with you…</p>
<p>“It was an accident,  I…Didn’t mean to.” Something flickered beneath the green  surface. It had also startled me that she came this far to admit a  fault.</p>
<p>I nodded in response.</p>
<p>“Mm…remember when I  said you should do what you’d like to today?” Ruka broke into a  lighter reverie. The ambiance brightened considerably from that one  sentence.</p>
<p>“Yes, what about it?”</p>
<p>“Ah…would you  like to go see a movie? With me?” She quickly added.</p>
<p>A  movie? “Do you have one in mind?”</p>
<p><strong>Tup, tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Our  waiter had returned. “Your order.” He smiled and placed the  plates in front of myself and then Ruka. “Did I hear someone  mention movies?” He questioned as though it were an off hand  comment.</p>
<p>“…I did.” Grunted Ruka.</p>
<p>Oh dear, I hope  I won’t have to resort to <em>that</em> again.</p>
<p>“I heard  there was a fantastic romance film playing by the crown arcade.”  The man mused while he began to re-fill our drinks.</p>
<p>“You  don’t say…”</p>
<p>Another sarcastic reply…</p>
<p>“What do  you think?” I asked my partner, hoping to curb her sudden defensive  position. She slowly turned to me, held eye contact for ten seconds  and then took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“That’s the one.” She  finally admitted.</p>
<p>“I never knew you to like romantic films.”  I teased. The other woman tensed up, with her eyes closed and her  eyes brows twitching against her will.</p>
<p>“I don’t… know  what you’re talking about.”</p>
<p>Aw, isn’t that cute? “Does  that mean we get to hold hands?” I reached out and grasp hers,  moving until our finger intertwined</p>
<p>Her hands  felt clammy, sweaty even. I looked up to see the shocked expression  upon her face and could only bring myself to smile back.</p>
<p>“Aww,  she’s blushing.”</p>
<p>Ruka broke our contact and berated our  server. “No I’m not!”</p>
<p>With an amused expression I  watched the man bend down to whisper something into my partner’s  ear. Ruka clearly darkened three shades of red. I wonder what he  said?</p>
<p>“Go away!” The man took off laughing. How strange,  did they know each other?</p>
<p>“Uhh, don’t  mind him.” Ruka assured me. She coughed, “Don’t forget to stay  away from those types.”</p>
<p>“You’ve spent a lot of time  talking him.” I noted.</p>
<p>“Jealous?”</p>
<p>…“…maybe.”  I barely whispered.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“The food is getting  cold.”</p>
<p>“Oh! I almost forgot.” Ruka smiled. “Man I’m  hungry.” She began to dig into her order.</p>
<p>However I paused  for a few seconds thinking,</p>
<p>…What if I said that I  was…</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV, movie theatre</u></p>
<p><u></u><strong>Kssh,  krrsh.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Baka blonde? Kay here. Answer baka  blonde.”</p>
<p>“I know you’re there!”</p>
<p>I  heard a sigh at the other end. “Yeah, yeah.”</p>
<p>“Did you  get the tickets?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah… For the mushiest one I  could find!” Her energetic voice then picked up a few tones.  “Hugging, kissing, the works! Haha, I wish I could see their faces  during some of these scenes. This will definitely be one date they  will never forget!”</p>
<p>She’s…so brilliantly evil!</p>
<p>“And  you left Rabbit in charge of the snacks?”</p>
<p>“Pssh,  naturally.”</p>
<p>“Right, then I’ll get to work on the  scavenger hunt. Once I deliver the first clue, hit the second point  and begin operation ‘domino’.”</p>
<p>“Roger.”</p>
<p><strong>Krrsh.</strong></p>
<p><u>Haruka’s  POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>Maybe this won’t be so bad after all. We were  only five minutes from the movie place now. Romance movies aren’t  so bad, but they’re always between a guy and a girl. It’s boring!  I mean, guy meets girl. The end. At least action movies have a little  something to them, like girl gets kidnapped and guy saves girl. The  end. However, watching these crap cliché movies have made me  appreciate my own life to an extent; mine is way more  exciting.</p>
<p>“We’re here.” I stated.</p>
<p>Michiru nodded  her head.</p>
<p>So where was Kaiya? I scanned the crowd, hoping to  recognize that disguise artist. Not that guy…nope not him  either…Briefly my eyes settled onto Michiru’s hand, which hung  loosely by her side. She caught me by surprise in the café, I  never expected her to do that. The feeling of her hand in mine still  lingered…and what Kaiya said then didn’t help worth shit! ‘Don’t  think dirty thoughts now,’ my ass.</p>
<p>My hand automatically  contracted. I mean, Michiru is only the most beautiful girl I’ve  ever laid my eyes on. Perfect mind, soul and…curves. I blinked. NO!  I didn’t mean that!</p>
<p>“Sorry I’m late.” Kaiya was hiding  behind my back. “Here.” She slipped the slips of paper into my  one open hand. “Have fun.”</p>
<p>And she was gone.</p>
<p>“Are  those the tickets?” Michiru was quick to notice. I was forever  grateful that she didn’t notice Kaiya take her leave.</p>
<p>“Umm…yup.”  I guess…</p>
<p>“May I see them?”</p>
<p>I handed them to  her, afraid to look at it myself. Who knows what horrors lay in store  for us?</p>
<p>“<em>Once upon a time, there was a dumb blonde named  Cinderuka</em>…”</p>
<p>“What?” I gasped.</p>
<p>Michiru  mirrored my own dumbfounded expression.</p>
<p>“It came with the  tickets…”</p>
<p><em>Cinderuka was a flirtatious man who ruled the  world of racing since a very early age. All across the kingdom he was  known as ‘the wind’, a being that was quick to change moods and  heart. However, although his life should’ve been anything a person  had wanted he was cursed to live the rest of his days flirting whilst  never finding his true love.</em></p>
<p><em>One day while out for a practice  drive, he came upon a forest growth that blocked his usual path.  ‘Stupid trees…’ He growled. Instead of looking for another  trail, he leaped out from his motorcycle and charged into the growth  to find its source. Thorns cut his legs, arms and scratched at his  face but it did not matter to Cinderuka. He would not give up.</em></p>
<p><em>“Geh…Where did all this come from?”</em></p>
<p><em>As he neared  closer, a sound of rushing water filled the air. “Water?” He  exclaimed in disbelief. The growth was beginning to let up and he  soon found himself free, out in the open…in the middle of  nowhere.</em></p>
<p>“In the middle of nowhere?” I yelled.  “Boy, that’s stupid.”</p>
<p>“Shush, I want to  know what happens.”</p>
<p><em>It appeared to be nowhere to  Cinderuka’s eyes but in fact, it was a small village. He walked  forward, his eyes couldn’t believe what he saw. Small houses, out  in the body of water. They appeared to hover above the blue  surface.</em></p>
<p><em>“Amazing…” He breathed.</em></p>
<p><em>“Like it?”  Another voice came from behind him. Startled he turned, to lay eyes  on the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes.” He  mouthed, unable to say anything else at the time.</em></p>
<p><em>“It’s  not much,” The woman cheerfully smiled, “but it’s  home.”</em></p>
<p><em>Cinderuka nodded at this. “But…where did it come  from? It wasn’t here before…”He slightly frowned.</em></p>
<p><em>His  companion held her mysterious smile as her pure aqua eyes shone a  strange light. “Or maybe…you were never looking in the right  place.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Huh?”</em></p>
<p><em>He watched the bewitching beauty  twirl a few steps forward past him, in the direction of the watery  village, her arms stretched out to imitate freedom itself.</em></p>
<p><em>“There’s  a dance tonight. Would you like to come?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Will you be  there?”</em></p>
<p><em>She nodded.</em></p>
<p><em>A smile lit his tired face.  “Then I gladly accept.” Anything to meet this girl again. The  loneliness inside began to melt at that sweet thought. “And…”</em></p>
<p><em>“And?”  She inquired.</em></p>
<p><em>“Please…wait for me. When we meet again, I  would like to tell you something.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Then I’ll be  waiting.”</em></p>
<p><br />
  “It doesn’t end there does it?” I  interrupted again.</p>
<p>Michiru flipped the paper. “Wait, there’s  a bit more.”</p>
<p><em><u>“Help Cinderuka find what he needs  to meet his love. Acquire items for two”</u></em></p>
<p><em><u></u>Clue 1: Where  an ugly duckling will become a swan</em></p>
<p>I exchanged  glances with Michiru and then we both looked at the tickets.</p>
<p>“You  don’t mind do you?” I really wanted to know where this would  lead!</p>
<p>“Actually, I’m curious as well.”</p>
<p>Yes! I  punched the air. “So, do you understand our first clue?”</p>
<p>“An  ugly duckling…” She pondered. “Well, unlike humans, an animal  such as a duckling cannot talk of the sort. So it must be relating to  its outer dress.”</p>
<p>“Dress? They don’t expect a guy to  wear a dress do they?” Kaiya really has an odd imagination if  that’s the case.</p>
<p>“A Tuxedo then.” Michiru kindly pointed  out for stupid o’l me.</p>
<p>“Hmm…so a tuxedo shop or  something?”</p>
<p>“A place with both dresses and  tuxedo’s.”</p>
<p>“Come again?”:</p>
<p>“The clue said ‘for  two’.”</p>
<p>Right… “Well, then let’s find this  place!”</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV, park</u></p>
<p><u></u><strong>Krrsh.</strong><u></u></p>
<p><u></u>“…Kay?”  Baka blonde mumbled.</p>
<p>“…Yeah?”</p>
<p>“How does the  story end?”</p>
<p>“It’s a secret.”</p>
<p><strong>Krrrrsh.  Blep.</strong></p>
<p>“How does the story end?” I hear a tearing  Usagi.</p>
<p>“I said it’s a secret.” I said in my best  irritated tone I could pull.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“You’ll  see.”</p>
<p><strong>Krrrsh.</strong></p>
<p><u>Michiru’s POV, swan  lake dress shop</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Ironic isn’t it?” Ruka mumbled  as we both peered up at the large sign.</p>
<p>I giggled. “It was a  very good clue wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>The usual grunt came as  expected.</p>
<p><strong>Tinkle, tinkle…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The bell chimed as  we entered the extravagant store. I’ve been in expensive places  prior to this, but this was overdone in everything! I also wonder who  wrote that clue. Although the story tale was meant to be regal in  ambiance, the fact it was in the form of a fairy tale appeared to  take on a childish yet mature outline.</p>
<p>I walked over to the  aqua marine gown that had caught my eye. For a strange reason, it  felt familiar…As the princess of Neptune in my past life, I suppose  it was no surprise. My mind drifted back towards the anonymous writer  again. To write anything meaningful, you must put your heart into it.  A fairy tale, the story context itself brings out many possibilities  that may unlock this writer’s inner self.</p>
<p>“Michi.” Ruka  called for me. Our host was here.</p>
<p>“Welcome, I’ve been  expecting you.” She greeted us both.</p>
<p>She was slim, young  woman of perhaps twenty six. The way her black dress hugged her  curves was enough to make anyone blush. My eyes glanced over to Ruka,  expecting some drooling action taking place, but I found  none.</p>
<p>Ruka?</p>
<p>“That’s good.” Ruka answered  back.</p>
<p>“Yes, isn’t it? Now to business, outfits for two.”  It sounded as though she expected us.</p>
<p>“Do you know who wrote  this?” I handed her our first clue.</p>
<p>“Who? No, of course  not. Although, they did give me this…” Ruka held out her hand. “  Ah ah…AFTER, I find you some outfits.” She grinned. “Now first,  color preference?”</p>
<p><u>Outside, an hour  later</u></p>
<p><u></u>“That…was…”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t that  bad.” I smiled.</p>
<p>We now had our second clue.</p>
<p>“Anyway,  what does it say?” Ruka put our packages down to peek over my  shoulder for a glance herself.</p>
<p><em>Clue 2: Cinderuka needs  transportation </em></p>
<p>My companion frowned. “Couldn’t  he walk?”</p>
<p>“It would ruin the story.” I automatically  deducted. “Besides, the place we’re going may not be a small  walk.”</p>
<p>“You’re telling me.” The taller woman groaned  as she picked up our parcels again. “Where to?”</p>
<p>“Your  place; you left your motorcycle there did you not?”</p>
<p>“Oh,  and it was in the story!”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>“Well,  let’s hurry, my arms are gonna get tired real fast.”</p>
<p><u>Kaiyia’s  POV, park</u></p>
<p><u></u><strong>Krrsssh.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Rabbit, did you  finish?”</p>
<p>“Blaaaaaah…I didn’t think it would be THIS  much work!”</p>
<p>“Come on, at least it’s for a good  cause.”</p>
<p>“Mhm…” Usagi groaned from the other end.  “Oops, I hear them coming, gotta go!”</p>
<p><strong>Krsssh.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Haruka’s  POV, parking lot</u></p>
<p><u></u>“M…My bike.” I couldn’t  believe it. No way…Michi stood still by my side, unable to find the  right words to describe this either.</p>
<p>Someone had polished  it.</p>
<p>“Shit, this is awesome!” I ran over to it.</p>
<p>It  was almost brand new, polished, waxed, and some of the parts had been  replaced with new padding and such.</p>
<p>“Wow…” Which was all  Michi could say as well.</p>
<p>I continued to look my baby all  over. Until I reached the bottom did I find the next clue.</p>
<p><em><br />
  Clue  3: A gift for a blossoming flower. A secret for one.</em></p>
<p>“I  know this one!” I yelled, startling Michi.</p>
<p>“You do?”</p>
<p>“I  can get some of these sometimes too you know…? Well, I can! Hop  on.” I handed her my helmet.</p>
<p>“Where are we going?” She  gave me a puzzled look.</p>
<p>“The  park.”</p>
<p><strong>Rrrr…..RrrrVrrroooooooOOOOOOM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Kaiya’s  POV</u></p>
<p><u></u><strong>Krrrsh.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Kay… how much LONGER?  I’m getting tired.”</p>
<p>“Me too.”</p>
<p>“You two are  done, head over to the final place. I’ll be there in a sec.”</p>
<p>I  paused to hear a motorcycle heading this way. Crap, no time to wait  around.</p>
<p>“I’m out.”</p>
<p><strong>Krrsh.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>Harukaa’s  POV, park</u></p>
<p><u></u>This has to be it! I thought as I ran  across the grass. I jumped down the final steps in bounds till I  reached the lake’s shore. There lay the aquamarine flowers Kaiya  picked everyday for Michi when she was sick.</p>
<p>“Found it…”  I breathed, slightly out of breath. But I can’t let Michi see it  yet according to the clue.</p>
<p>I carefully plucked the beautiful  flower and began to wrap it up in paper. The task wasn’t as simple  as I thought it would be but somehow I managed.</p>
<p>There…</p>
<p>“But  where is the clue?”</p>
<p>I began searching around the area,  anxious to discover what was left to do. I mean, from the fairy tale  there couldn’t be much more a guy needed. Right?</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>A  color of white caught my eye. Following it, I pushed through a few  elongated grasses to see a folded paper boat floating on the water’s  edge. There it was…</p>
<p><em>Clue 4: To find the way, follow  this</em></p>
<p>A map?</p>
<p>I grinned at this; everything  wasn’t far off now. I really do wonder how this story will  end.</p>
<p><strong>Tup, tup, tup…</strong></p>
<p><u>Later that  evening, ballroom</u></p>
<p><u></u>“This is some get together.”  Makoto awed. “Your dad sure went all out didn’t he?”</p>
<p>Ami,  Makoto and Rei stood by the food table, watching over the  festivities.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s too bad Minako and Usagi are  sleeping over there.” Rei pointed to the exhausted blondes, sitting  out on the bench snoozing against one another. “On the bright side,  you guys sure helped scare away that one business weirdo. Hmm…But  back to now. Do you think we should wake them?”</p>
<p>“Don’t  worry, if they’re tired sleep is best for them.” Ami suggested as  she reached over to pour herself a glass of punch.</p>
<p>“Admit  it, you would rather have all the cute guys to yourself.” The miko  grinned ear to ear as Ami almost choked on her drink.</p>
<p>“R-Rei!”  She gasped.</p>
<p>Makoto shrugged her shoulders and chuckled, not  knowing what else to do. So instead she patted her red faced friend  on the back.</p>
<p>“She’s just teasing.”</p>
<p>“I  know…”</p>
<p>“Anyway, have you guys seen Michiru and Haruka?  You’d think Kaiya would invite them as well.” Rei commented  again. Ami sighed a breth of relief to be out as center of attention  and decided to keep it that way.</p>
<p>“They may come later due to  obligations and such.”</p>
<p>“Such as school?”</p>
<p>“The  music is changing.” Makoto noted. The other two girls became  attentive to the change in atmosphere as well.</p>
<p>“It’s…classical.”</p>
<p>“A waltz?”</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s  Pov, changing room</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Michi?” I called out.</p>
<p>I  guess she’s already out there. Oh well…probably for the best, I’d  ruin the surprise flower if she didn’t, I chuckled.</p>
<p>“So,  you ready?”</p>
<p>I spun around. “Kaiya!”</p>
<p>“Yo.”</p>
<p>There  was so much I wanted to say. Like…the scavenger hunt was loads of  fun. It was an actual adventure! But I think I’ll skip out on the  part where I say, ‘oh, we didn’t use the movie tickets’.</p>
<p>“You  wrote that story?”</p>
<p>“I did.”</p>
<p>“…How does it  end?”</p>
<p>“…Heh.”</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV,  ballroom</u></p>
<p><u></u>Everything appears to be going according to  plan…I stepped forward a few steps and froze as a negative energy  wave sent my senses crazy. Bad feeling…I glanced around the room,  over the faces, by the food table and over to the twins, trying to  detect the presence. Where is it?</p>
<p>Finally my gaze landed over  a red haired woman standing amidst a talking crowd. She was  socializing with a few older men, nothing out of the ordinary…to a  normal person.</p>
<p>Ah…I suppose each fairy tale wouldn’t be  complete without a villain. I saw her piercing red eyes connect to my  aqua ones.</p>
<p>Well, unfortunately I can’t let you disrupt this  scene, invited or not. I cocked my head to the entrance that led out,  then glanced there, implying we take this outside. The other woman’s  eyes glinted with violent intent; was she here to see me? She then  smirked before she left the circle of men that had gathered around  her.</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s POV, ballroom</u></p>
<p><u></u><em>‘The  story went like this…’</em></p>
<p><em>Cinderuka entered the large  white hall filled withtown’s folk. With an uncommon nervousness, he  strolled in towards the middle, hoping to find the object of his  desires, the girls with aqua hair and eyes.</em></p>
<p>“I  wonder…where Michi went.” I gripped the wrapped paper in my hands  through my clammy hands.</p>
<p><em>Finally, he had spotted her  at the other end, surrounded by many male admirers. At this,  Cinderuka felt a pang of extreme jealously before it deflated into  dejection. There were many men out there for her and she must already  have her eye on one of them. What did he have that they  didn’t?</em></p>
<p>“Ruka.”</p>
<p>Michi…?</p>
<p><em>To  his surprise the beautiful maiden made her way past her admirers over  to where Cinderuka awaited astonished. Other men made faces as they  saw the aqua goddess walk out of their grasps to one lucky male  across the room. As this happened, many young maidens who had eyed  the handsome Cinderuka felt themselves bear pangs of jealously as  well. Now, all eyes were on the two individuals who seemed to  outshine all others.</em></p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV, outside</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Good  evening isn’t it?” The red haired woman gave a mocking laugh.  “Come now, at least look a little scared.” Her gun was out by her  side, intent perfectly clear.</p>
<p>A Death Buster…</p>
<p>“Don’t  ignore me you stupid human!”</p>
<p>Haruka, Michiru… “I can’t  tell you how the story ends…”</p>
<p>“What are you talking  about?” My opponent snapped.</p>
<p>“…because…it’s up to  you.”</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s POV, ballroom</u></p>
<p><u></u>I  swallowed. It was now or never. Everything I’ve been holding back,  all my pain and angst over this forbidden love. I was painfully aware  of how it all felt; the clamminess of my hands, the heat in the room,  the way others were watching…But…who cared about what <em>they</em> thought? Kaiya’s words in the café came flooding back to me. <em>‘Status, money, fame, forget all that shit! Do you love her?’ </em>I know I do, more than anything.</p>
<p>My gaze locked with  Michi’s, hoping that there she had a shred of feeling of what I  felt for her. All we’ve been through, our childhood, our  friendship…it would never be the same after this, and I knowledge  that.</p>
<p>“Michi?” But I want to try…</p>
<p>The room held  their breath.</p>
<p>My fist holding the paper came up as I moved to  unravel it with the other. The paper unfolded and fell to the flower,  revealing the jewel that could only be surpassed by the beauty before  me. I gathered my courage for the right words to say what I really  meant. If I’m going to do this, I won’t falter halfway.</p>
<p>I  took her hand and handed her my gift. As soon as I was sure she had  hold of it, I looked up to see we now only a few inches apart. “Kaioh  Michiru, my name is Tenoh Haruka and…I love you. Will you be my  princess?”</p>
<p>Michi released the flower and as I watched it  fall, I was numbly aware that our lips had met. Warmth spread out  through my heart. My arms came around to embrace my princess, meeting  her own soft embrace…when I realized we both were crying.</p>
<p>Clapping  erupted around the room, making this moment even more real. It  appeared Usagi and Minako were awake now as well.</p>
<p>“Wahoo!  Way to go Haruka!” They cheered.</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV,  outside</u></p>
<p>Clapping…I looked up to the sky.</p>
<p>Way  to go, I knew you had it in you. What’s more, I felt a strange  sense of peace despite the danger of my predicament.</p>
<p>“Your  wrong.” I corrected the witch. “It’s a fantastic  evening.”</p>
<p>“Bull  shit!”</p>
<p><strong>BAM!</strong></p>
