<h1>Kazeko (part 15 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kazeko.html">kazeko</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/kazeko-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>Michiru slept peacefully for the first time in a week since Setsuna was 
finally awake.  Very few people realized the close relationship between 
the Outers affected their mental state when one was sick or injured.  
Michiru had been so sick with worry over the woman who had been like an 
older sister or a mother to her in the past years that Haruka wondered 
if Michiru would end up in bed, too.  Haruka leaned against the doorway 
and just watched her, amazed that such perfection was hers.  She was 
grateful to whatever miracle brought them together, and she never wanted 
this period of peace to end.
 
&quot;You&#39;re very lucky.&quot;
 
Haruka looked up as Setsuna spoke from the doorway beside her.  The 
green haired woman was still weak from her long sleep, but she stood 
under her own power and refused to show any sign that the last weak even 
happened.  &quot;I know, Setsuna-san.  What about Ailan-san?&quot;
 
A smile of purest joy lit Setsuna&#39;s face, a smile Haruka had never seen 
before.  &quot;She&#39;s decided to stay, Haruka-san, for as long as she lives.  
I can&#39;t tell you how happy that makes me.  She asked me to become a 
partner in Moonlight Fashions, and I&#39;ve agreed.  It&#39;s always been my 
dream to design clothes, though the little I do for you two and 
Hotaru-chan is all I&#39;ve been able to amange so far.  It looks like we&#39;ll 
get to have the life here that we were never allowed in the Silver 
Millennium.  She promised to be with me forever.&quot;
 
&quot;I hope you&#39;re happy.&quot;  Setsuna smiled as she left, closing the door 
behind her.  &quot;Because I am,&quot; Haruka added, slipping out of her robe and 
sliding into bed beside her lover and wife.  Michiru automatically 
rolled over and nestled into Haruka&#39;s arms.  &quot;I never want to lose you,&quot; 
Haruka whispered to the aqua-haired woman in her arms.  &quot;Never.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;Just tell me what&#39;s wrong!&quot;
 
&quot;Calm down, Michiru-san!&quot;  Ami laughed as she scribbled notes on her 
pad, glancing over her shoulder to see of her friends were finished with 
the lab work.  Since the genius had been able to advance very quickly 
through med school, she was already poised to become a real doctor and 
was interning under one of the more successful gynecologists in Tokyo.  
She was also learning to deliver and care for babies, her passion.  
However, when Michiru visited her gynecologist to see why her body was 
acting up, the woman had been unavoidably detained delivery triplets, 
and Ami was allowed to do the tests on her friend.  She never lost her 
professional manner, even amid the excitement, and Michiru knew she&#39;d 
make a great doctor someday.  &quot;Michiru-san, has this ever happened 
before?&quot;
 
The aqua-haired woman thought a moment, glancing at her wife as Ami 
adjusted her reading glasses.  &quot;Well, once.  When I was younger, I had 
one year where my hormone levels were really bad and I missed three or 
four periods, I think.  The doctor said that it was just a phase that I 
would grow out of, but it might come back.  Do you think it could be 
that?&quot;
 
&quot;We&#39;re checking.&quot;
 
&quot;You don&#39;t think it could be something else . . . something worse?&quot;
 
Ami patted Michiru&#39;s arm, smiling kindly.  &quot;Don&#39;t get worried.  These 
things happen.  Everyone misses a period now and then.  I really don&#39;t 
know why you came in the first place.&quot;
 
Michiru glared at her wife, and Haruka raised her hands defensively.  
&quot;Hey!  I was worried!  You&#39;ve always been perfectly regular, and my body 
readjusted to your clock, so when you&#39;re off, my hormones go crazy.  
Besides, Ami-chan, she wouldn&#39;t let me sleep with her last night.&quot;
 
The blue-eyed genius blushed, sticking her head out the door to get the 
test results as Michiru lightly punched her wife.  Haruka feigned pain 
as Ami returned, studying the results.  Makoto, who had stayed silent at 
Ami&#39;s reaction to Haruka&#39;s comment, glanced up from her book for a 
moment.  She was stretched out on the couch in the corner that was 
supposed to be reserved for the patients but belonged to the senshi of 
Jupiter while she waited for Ami to finish.  Sometimes she studied, but 
often she just read for fun, mostly ignoring the events around her.  
&quot;Don&#39;t worry; Ami knows what you&#39;re talking about.&quot;
 
And then everything started to go wrong.
 
Ami gasped, the papers fluttering to the floor as she collapsed against 
the counter, staring at Michiru.  Her sapphire eyes were wide, one hand 
covering her mouth.  Makoto dropped her book and dashed to Ami&#39;s side, 
gathering the papers the water senshi had dropped.  &quot;What is all of this 
saying, Ami?&quot;
 
&quot;It&#39;s impossible!  There&#39;s no explanation . . . this can&#39;t have 
happened!&quot;
 
&quot;What, Ami?  What couldn&#39;t have happened?&quot;
 
Ami turned to look at Michiru.  &quot;She&#39;s . . . pregnant.&quot;
 
Michiru fainted.
 
Haruka caught the Sea Senshi before she hit the ground, easily lifting 
her and laying her on the couch Makoto had recently vacated.  She 
touched Michiru&#39;s cheek, knowing that she would not have normally 
fainted, reaching for her wife with her mind.  She placed a hand on 
Michiru&#39;s belly and gasped as a power answered hers, a faint spark of 
consciousness responding to her light probe.  Haruka looked up at the 
genius, green eyes no longer distant.  &quot;Ami-chan, how can that be?  How 
is this possible?  When could it have happened?&quot;  Haruka&#39;s mind flew 
back to the night of her wedding, and she blushed beet-red as she 
suddenly recognized the burst of power that filled the room that night.  
&quot;Oh,&quot; she whispered.  She glared at Makoto as the brunette burst out 
laughing, the look of pure guilt on Haruka&#39;s face so strange that she 
couldn&#39;t help it.
 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Haruka-san!  When . . . when did this happen?&quot;
 
&quot;Our wedding night,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;That&#39;s why Setsuna returned our 
memories so suddenly.  She didn&#39;t want this to happen again.&quot;
 
&quot;Again?&quot;  Makoto&#39;s mind automatically flew to the Silver Millennium, and 
she swallowed.  &quot;I remember the huge burst of power from the outer 
planets that made our Keystones join the crystals of our planets in the 
Silver Millennium.  Did that have anything to do with you?&quot;
 
Haruka smiled.  &quot;Yes.  That was the night we conceived Helios.&quot;
 
&quot;Helios?!  He&#39;s your child?&quot;
 
Before Haruka could answer the two Inners, Michiru groaned and opened 
her eyes, closing them instantly at the worry evident in her lover&#39;s 
stance.  &quot;I wasn&#39;t dreaming.  Oh no.  She&#39;s going to kill us.&quot;
 
&quot;She&#39;ll kill me.  It was my fault, in any case.&quot;
 
Michiru opened her eyes and took Haruka&#39;s hand, placing in on her flat 
belly.  &quot;I almost can&#39;t believe it.  We never got a chance with Helios, 
and I wanted to raise him with you.  This child is our second chance, a 
baby we can raise together.&quot;
 
&quot;I know how much you&#39;ve wanted a child of your own.&quot;
 
Michiru grinned.  &quot;Actually, I always wanted to have a child of yours.  
I&#39;m very greedy, you see.  Maybe some part of me remembered Helios and 
wanted to give him a . . . a what?  A brother?  A sister?&quot;
 
&quot;Genetically speaking,&quot; Ami interrupted gently, &quot;it would only be 
possible for you to have a girl.  You don&#39;t have the chromosomes for a 
son.&quot;
 
&quot;What about Helios?&quot;
 
Ami shrugged.  &quot;Not having been there, I really can&#39;t say.  But there 
was a lot more power in this Solar System during the Silver Millennium, 
and maybe the planets, newly freed from their sleep, had the strength to 
make a male whose destiny it was to guard the Golden Crystal.  It had to 
be a boy, since the Golden Crystal&#151;unlike the crystals of the other 
planets&#151;only recognizes male guardians and rulers.  If the Universe 
needs something, it will find a way to create it.&quot;
 
Michiru rolled her eyes at the long explanation, sitting up.  &quot;Ami-chan, 
are you sure about this?&quot;
 
Glancing over her shoulder to make sure none of her friends or 
colleagues were coming, Ami pulled out her computer and scanned the 
senshi.  &quot;Your energy readings indicate a second, very small and very 
weak pulse inside you.  You are most definitely pregnant, and there 
doesn&#39;t seem to be any problems that would keep you from coming to term.  
Though, I have no basis for comparison.  With the exception of Usagi, we 
have no idea if any of the senshi ever have or will have children.  Our 
memories of the visit with our future selves are sketchy, but I remember 
no daughters.  And there is the added danger of this Guardian of the 
Balance that has Setsuna-san so worked up.&quot;
 
Haruka wrapped her free arm around Michiru&#39;s waist.  &quot;I won&#39;t let any of 
Her servants hurt you, Michiru.&quot;
 
Michiru sighed, knowing better than to respond.  &quot;Setsuna is going to 
kill us.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Ailan smiled at Setsuna as they glanced at their newest sketches.  &quot;I 
don&#39;t know, Setsu-chan.  This one looks suspiciously like the dress you 
wore to the last dance.&quot;
 
&quot;Well, maybe.&quot;  Setsuna pulled out another pile, watching as shock 
spread across her partner&#39;s face.  &quot;I drew all of the dresses from the 
last ball.  I thought they might be interesting.&quot;
 
&quot;We&#39;ll see what we can do.&quot;  Both women looked up as Haruka and Michiru 
returned home, four younger senshi following in their wake.  Setsuna 
stood up as the senshi sat on the couches in pairs, all avoiding her 
eyes.  Rei looked at Minako, Makoto looked at Ami, and Ami looked up at 
the married couple.  Unlike the other five, Minako didn&#39;t seem 
uncomfortable or worried; her eyes reflected utter joy, though she kept 
them pointed at the ground.
 
&quot;What happened?&quot;
 
Michiru reached for Haruka, who clasped her hand in both of hers.  The 
aqua-haired senshi swallowed convulsively, her free hand on her flat 
belly.  Setsuna&#39;s garnet eyes widened as the Neptunian Princess looked 
at her, sapphire eyes incredibly worried.  Her voice, when she spoke, 
could not have drowned out a little kitten&#39;s first cry.  &quot;Setsuna,&quot; she 
whispered, pausing for a moment to wet her lips.  &quot;I&#39;m pregnant.&quot;
 
Setsuna&#39;s legs gave out, some small part of her brain registering the 
jolt of pain that shot through her as her body hit her chair.  
Incredulous, she summoned her Time Staff, pulling the Garnet Orb into 
her hands and staring into it.  A golden-haired girl stared back.  &quot;It&#39;s 
a girl,&quot; Haruka added, knowing it was unnecessary.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;
 
Setsuna looked up sharply, the Garnet Orb vanishing.  &quot;Sorry?  For her?  
Why?&quot;
 
&quot;It was my fault.  It just . . . happened, right before you returned our 
memories.  I know that you wanted to prevent this, and I guess this is 
probably one of the reasons you&#39;re in trouble with the Guardian of the 
Balance.  I&#39;m sorry that we got you in trouble.&quot;
 
Setsuna looked at Ailan, smiling as she looked back up at the married 
couple.  &quot;I&#39;m not upset,&quot; the Senshi of Time smiled.  &quot;I&#39;m happy for 
both of you.  I don&#39;t care anymore what the Guardian of Balance wants.  
Your daughter is the reason the old queens were afraid to let the powers 
of Uranus and Neptune combine; the possibilities are endless for the 
daughter of two senshi.  After all, Usagi is the first Sailor Moon ever 
to power up to Eternal, and she&#39;s going to be the Queen of the Earth and 
the Moon.  Your daughter could be anything.  And I&#39;m proud of you.&quot;
 
Michiru&#39;s eyes filled with tears.  &quot;Really?  You&#39;re not angry?&quot;
 
&quot;No,&quot; Setsuna whispered.  &quot;No.&quot;  She jumped up and took two steps, 
pulling the two women into her arms.  &quot;I wasn&#39;t angry then and I&#39;m not 
angry now.  I am so happy.&quot;
 
Minako cleared her throat.  &quot;So, if Setsuna-san isn&#39;t going to kill you, 
can we celebrate?&quot;
 
Michiru smiled, raising one eyebrow as her stomach growled.  &quot;Oh, can 
that celebration involve food?  I&#39;m hungry.&quot;
 
&quot;What do you mean, you&#39;re hungry?&quot;  Haruka glared at her wife as Setsuna 
stepped back, and the smaller woman crossed her arms over her chest.
 
&quot;Well, I am eating for two now.  Though I still bet you could out-do me 
any day of the week.&quot;
 
&quot;Hey!&quot;
 
Setsuna felt Ailan wrap her slender arms around her waist, the 
silver-haired woman resting her chin on Setsuna&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;There, 
that wasn&#39;t so hard, was it?&quot;
 
Setsuna smiled.  &quot;I really am happy, Ailan.  When I learned about Helios 
not long before his parents died, I was so upset, and it took me a long 
time to learn that I was only upset because Michiru and Haruka died, not 
because they conceived a child.  And Michiru has always wanted to be a 
mother.&quot;
 
&quot;I think maybe this is why Balance was so angry at you.&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t care.  She can&#39;t have this child.  We&#39;ll protect their 
daughter, Ailan.  No matter what.&quot;</pre>
