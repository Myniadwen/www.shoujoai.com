<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a>

<a href="../smoon/mamodie-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>---Editorial---

&quot;Ladies and gentleman,&quot; an annoyed voice began, &quot;For no good reason 
whatsoever, here&#39;s yet another interminable editorial against the series 
Mamoru Must Die.&quot;

Two women appear on screen standing side-by-side against the usual 
curtain background.

&quot;Greetings.&quot; the first one said, &quot;I&#39;m of course Princess Kakyuu. You no 
doubt remember me from Sailor Stars and the last omake.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;m Sailor Galaxia.&quot; the other stated, &quot;You&#39;ll remember me of 
course as the villain of Sailor Stars, who was redeemed in the end by 
Sailor Moon&#39;s kindly heart, and who then ended the series by floating 
above the ground in her birthday suit with Usagi.&quot;

&quot;How could they forget?&quot; Princess Kakyuu put in, &quot;The images from that 
finale are all over the internet hentai sites. Do you have any idea how 
many places on the web have pictures of the two of you naked together?&quot;

&quot;(sigh) Don&#39;t remind me. I&#39;m still in litigation with the producers for 
leaking those behind the scene photos to the press. I mean, you make one 
little nude scene when you&#39;re younger, and for the rest of your life 
you&#39;re haunted by it. I...&quot;

&quot;Galatia, dear.&quot; Kakyuu gently chided.

&quot;Oops, oh yeah. Right. Anyways, we&#39;re sure you out there at home are all 
wondering what in the world could possibly bring two one-time mortal 
enemies like us together like this. Well, if you pan the camera down 
you&#39;ll see why we&#39;re out here.&quot;

The camera panned down to reveal Chibi Chibi standing between the two 
wearing gold chains around her little neck, a pair of sunglasses on her 
face, and her pink hair done up into cornrows. She smiled as she waved 
to the camera.

&quot;Chibi chibi biiiyyyyaaatch!&quot; she said in her kawaii little voice.

The camera then panned back up to the concerned faces of Princess Kakyuu 
and Sailor Galaxia.

&quot;That&#39;s right ladies and gentleman,&quot; the Princess said, &quot;This stupid 
omake series you&#39;re reading even now has taken cute little Chibi Chibi 
here, once the most kawaii character in anime history, and has turned 
her into a gangsta bitch!&quot;

&quot;And where does the blame lay?&quot; Galaxia asked, &quot;Sadly, it lies with both 
the author of this trash and the viewing public who reads this. And poor 
little Chibi Chibi here is the victim.&quot;

&quot;Good point Galaxia, and very well put.&quot; Princess Kakyuu said. Galaxia 
suddenly smiled at the woman next to her.

&quot;Well I... Really?&quot; the most powerful Sailor Senshi of them all asked, 
&quot;You really think I did a good job there just now?&quot;

&quot;Wha... Well, of course. You have a very commanding voice. I first 
noticed it of course when you were possessed by Chaos and trying to kill 
me, but now that you&#39;re a good guy again you still have a marvelous 
speaking voice.&quot;

&quot;Wow... Thanks.&quot; Galaxia said as a slight blush suddenly colored her 
cheeks, &quot;You know,&quot; she began, &quot;You have a good... No, a beautiful voice 
yourself. It matches well the beauty in your face.&quot;

Now it was the Princess&#39; turn to blush, &quot;Th... Thank you.&quot; she said, 
adding, &quot;You&#39;re... Quite the looker yourself, you know.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Sailor Galaxia said stepping closer. &quot;P... Princess... Can I 
call you just Kakyuu?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Of course.&quot; the Princess answered.

&quot;Kakyuu, would... Would you like to... Maybe go somewhere to talk. You 
know, possibly get to know each other a little better? I mean, we&#39;re no 
longer trying to kill each other, so...&quot;

&quot;I... I&#39;d like that.&quot; Kakyuu said as she met Galaxia&#39;s eyes, &quot;I know 
just the place, too. It&#39;s in a fanfic by Shanejayell two stories over. 
If we leave now, we should be able to get a good table.&quot;

With that, Princess Kakyuu put her hand in the crook of Galaxia&#39;s arm as 
the two continued to stare mesmerized into each other&#39;s eyes. As the two 
wandered off smiling, the camera panned back down to the ghetto-ized 
Chibi Chibi.

&quot;Chibi chibi biiiyyyyaaatch!&quot; the kawaii little thug said as she flashed 
a gang sign.

---Omake Eighteen: The Fairy Tale---

Once upon a time, in the enchanted land of fairies, unicorns and goblins 
known as Crystal Tokyo, there was a terrible fire-breathing dragon who 
did steal the young and beautiful Princess Serenity away from the 
Kingdom, along with three of her beautiful Ladies in Waiting.

There was the elegant and refined Court Musician, Lady Michiru.

The strong yet cute Court Cook, Lady Makoto.

And finally the beautiful Gate Keeper, Duchess Setsuna.

The Kingdom of Crystal Tokyo was outraged by this cruel action taken 
against the four helpless young lasses, and in the great meeting hall 
the Duke of Ellington, the Count of Basie, and Louis of Satchmo all 
decided that something had to be done and done immediately. Scouring the 
Kingdom for the bravest and finest to go slay the dragon and save the 
four maidens, they ended up with a knightly dream-team of Prince 
Endymion of Hapless, Sir Ruka of Butch, Sir Rei of the Sacred Flame, Sir 
Mina of Quirky, and Sir Ami of Grey-Matter.

And of course Sir Not Appearing in this Fanfic.

&quot;Brave Sir Knights,&quot; Louis of Satchmo began in a gravelly voice, 
&quot;Together you five shall set out in search of the foul monster. With you 
go our hopes and prayers, as well as our three best young squires, 
Seiya, Taiki and Yaten.&quot;

&quot;Hello.&quot;

&quot;Hello.&quot;

&quot;Hello.&quot; the three squires in question sang out as they now came into 
the Royal hall. Rei raised an eyebrow.

&quot;They&#39;re our squires?&quot; the raven-haired young knight asked skeptically.

&quot;They don&#39;t look like much.&quot; Sir Ruka of Butch said, pointing at Seiya 
as she added, &quot;Especially that one.&quot;

&quot;Now, now.&quot; Prince Endymion of Hapless interrupted, &quot;He just said they 
were the best squires, did he not? I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be in competent 
hands.&quot;

&quot;Certainly, we&#39;re all incompetent.&quot; Seiya said in reply. Taiki looked 
over angrily at his fellow squire.

&quot;Pick out two.&quot; he ordered as he held his hand in front of Seiya.

&quot;One, two. OW!&quot; Seiya shrieked as Taiki poked him in the eyes.

&quot;Hey, leave him alone.&quot; Yaten said, only to be answered for his troubles 
by a smack to the face by Taiki.

&quot;Quiet numbskull!&quot; the taller squire threatened. Sir Mina rolled her 
eyes.

&quot;If those three are to be doing that all through this knavish story, 
then this is going to be one loooong omake.&quot; the blonde knight quipped.

&quot;Fourth... aw, forget it. I do give up.&quot; Sir Ami said as she bowed her 
head and raised her arms in defeat, &quot;Let us just cut to the next scene 
already.&quot;

------

In a dark stone room near the top of a large stone tower, four beautiful 
young women were chained to a wall.

&quot;My Princess,&quot; Duchess Setsuna said sorrowfully, &quot;I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ve 
failed you.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Serenity said, &quot;Surely you have not failed me yet. None of you 
have.&quot;

&quot;Serenity,&quot; Lady Michiru began, &quot;How can you say that? We&#39;re you&#39;re 
ladies in waiting; it&#39;s our responsibility to...&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re only failures if we give up.&quot; Serenity answered, &quot;I&#39;m sure that 
even now a rescue party is being put together by the nobles at Court, 
and we may yet escape this foul villainy.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Lady Makoto said, adding, &quot;Always remember; as long as 
there is life there is hope, and...&quot; her voice trailed off as the heavy 
sounds of something large coming toward them up the tower stairs could 
be heard. Suddenly, the huge red dragon in question came into the room 
through the large door, its huge membranous wings pulled in tight to its 
sides to give it the necessary clearance.

&quot;Heaven&#39;s to Murgatroyd.&quot; the dragon said in a slightly effeminate 
voice, &quot;Next time I kidnap a princess I should use a larger prison, a 
big cave even.&quot;

&quot;Ugh.&quot; Serenity grunted as she pulled against the chains holding her 
fast to the wall, &quot;What do you want, o fearsome one? Why have you 
kidnapped me and my Ladies in waiting?&quot;

&quot;Oh that?&quot; the dragon asked with a smile, &quot;I want to be in control of 
the Kingdom, the throne even. I already have a large enough secret stash 
of gold under this tower to hire my own army, mercenaries even. But I 
decided to instead go to the top and kidnap you, the Princess even. This 
way I&#39;ll keep my gold and the nobles will give me the Kingdom to get you 
back, safely even.&quot;

&quot;And... And pray, what of us?&quot; Lady Michiru asked nervously.

&quot;Oh, I plan on eating the three of you. You&#39;re my dinner, supper even. 
I...&quot; the scaly monster&#39;s voice trailed off as the sound of a squire&#39;s 
trumpet announced the presence of the Royal Ladies&#39; rescuers. The 
monster looked out the stone window behind Duchess Setsuna.

&quot;Heaven&#39;s to Murgatroyd.&quot; the dragon said, &quot;It looks like a gaggle of 
Knights, Dragon-Slayers even.&quot; He then turned to the four captives, &quot;You 
girls wait here while I take care of this. Exit, stage left.&quot; he said as 
he left the room.

------

Tension filled the brave group as the knights quickly dismounted from 
their horses and put on their helmets, arming themselves with their 
swords, shields, spears, bows and arrows and battle axes. As Yaten 
finished blowing on his trumpet, the deadly dragon appeared in the skies 
above them, flying around in circles high above the rescue party as 
billowing flames belched from its cavernous mouth.

As the knights anxiously awaited the dragon&#39;s attack, Taiki turned to 
Seiya.

&quot;Listen puddin&#39; head,&quot; Taiki said, &quot;This may be our big break.&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot; Seiya said as he fearfully watched the dragon flying above 
them, &quot;We&#39;ll make a break for it while they&#39;re not looking.&quot;

Smack!

&quot;Not that kind of break you ignoramus!&quot; Taiki said, &quot;I mean this may be 
our chance to become knights.&quot;

&quot;How are we going to do that?&quot; Yaten asked as he came over to his fellow 
squires.

&quot;Simple stupid; you grab that extra spear Sir Rei of the Sacred Flame 
brought with her. Seiya, you take that spare bow and arrow hanging off 
the rear of Sir Mina of Quirky&#39;s saddle.&quot;

The two quickly grabbed the objects and yanked them over, in the process 
both ended up getting Taiki in the gut with the blunt end of the 
weapons.

&quot;Eh, Taiki, we&#39;re sorry.&quot; Seiya said as Taiki clutched his abdomen 
painfully.

&quot;Does it hurt?&quot; Yaten asked. Taiki narrowed his eyes as he frowned 
angrily at his two fellow squires.

&quot;No, does THIS?&quot; he asked as he smacked them both.

Meanwhile, Sir Ruka of Butch clung white-knuckled onto her large sword, 
her shield held up in front of her. She looked over to her right to see 
Sir Ami of Grey-Matter, sweat beginning to run down the nervous young 
knight&#39;s brow.

&quot;Hey, Sir Ami?&quot; The sandy-blonde knight asked as she tried to distract 
Ami from the upcoming combat, &quot;Should we live through this, what do you 
plan to do?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; the smaller knight answered as she held onto her spear, &quot;You 
know the taller Lady in waiting, Lady Makoto? I...&quot; she blushed as her 
voice dropped to just above a whisper, &quot;I&#39;m going to ask for her hand. 
Yourself?&quot;

Sir Ruka smiled, &quot;I have my eyes set on the aqua-haired lass, Lady 
Michiru.&quot; she answered. She then turned to Sir Mina, her golden locks 
all but covered by the heavy metal helmet she wore upon her head, &quot;Good 
Sir Mina, when this is all over...&quot;

&quot;The fair Duchess Setsuna.&quot; she answered, not waiting for Sir Ruka to 
finish her question, &quot;Hers is a quiet and mysterious beauty, but it has 
still captured my heart. She would be a welcome, calming influence upon 
me. And you good Sir Rei?&quot; the blonde asked as she turned to the knight 
standing to her left.

Sir Rei of the Sacred Flame almost answered, but held her tongue when 
she turned to Prince Endymion the Hapless. He it was that was engaged to 
the good Princess Serenity, and it was no use pining away for a love 
that would never be hers.

She was pulled out of her thoughts as the dragon suddenly came down in a 
spiraling nosedive, pulling up at the last moment and knocking both 
knights and squires down by the force of its backdraft. The monstrous 
creature then came down to land behind the group, meaning that the three 
squires who were behind the knights before were now in front of them.

&quot;Come on numbskulls!&quot; Taiki said, &quot;Now&#39;s our chance to... Hey Seiya! 
You&#39;re holding the bow backwards stupid.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Seiya asked as he let the arrow go sailing behind him.

Ka-Thunk!

The three squires turned to join the horrified knights who were staring 
as the arrow sticking in the middle of Prince Endymion&#39;s forehead. As 
they watched, the Prince&#39;s eyes rolled up to the back of his head and he 
fell backward, dead.

Taiki turned angrily to Seiya.

&quot;Why you puddin&#39; head!&quot; he said as he poked Seiya in the eyes.

&quot;Heavens to Murgatroyd,&quot; the dragon began, &quot;You knights aren&#39;t very good 
at this, terrible even!&quot;

&quot;Terrible, eh?&quot; Sir Ruka growled as she and Sir Ami stalked forward, 
&quot;Let&#39;s see how terrible we are now!&quot; she yelled as she rushed forward, 
sword in hand. Before she could attack however, the dragon reached one 
of its clawed hands forward and easily plucked the sword from Ruka&#39;s 
hand. She then tossed the brave knight aside, flinging her into Sir Ami, 
knocking the spear from the smaller knight&#39;s hand.

As the two valiant knights struggled to get back to their feet, Sir Mina 
ran forward, holding her shield up in front of her as she clutched 
tightly onto her battle axe.

&quot;Time to do the fire breathing bit, cook ya even.&quot; the dragon said just 
before letting loose with a steady stream of hot billowing flames aimed 
at the brave young blonde. Sir Mina crouched behind the shield, 
clenching her teeth as she clutched onto the now red-hot shield while it 
painfully began to burn her hands.

The dragon stopped just long enough to swat the shield away from Sir 
Mina&#39;s scorched hands. It then took a deep breath, intending to let 
loose with a fatal blast.

Ka-thunk!

&quot;Ow!&quot; the dragon bellowed as an arrow buried itself painfully into its 
paw, &quot;That arrow hurt, smarts even!&quot; The monster then turned in time to 
see the archer, Sir Rei of the Sacred Flame, tossing the bow aside as 
she picked up the spear that good Sir Ami dropped.

&quot;How did you get through my defenses when they couldn&#39;t, failed even?&quot; 
the dragon asked.

&quot;Well, if you&#39;d bothered to read the script for this omake,&quot; Rei 
snarled, smiling grimly as she aimed her spear, &quot;You&#39;d know by now I&#39;m 
the hero!&quot; she said, grunting a bit as she flung the spear and struck 
the dragon in its evil black heart.

The dragon clutched its chest, &quot;H... Heavens to M... M... Murgatroyd...&quot; 
it said just before falling to the ground dead.

------

&quot;Eat us!&quot; Lady Makoto said, &quot;The foul beast did say it was going to...&quot;

&quot;Ladies, please.&quot; Princess Serenity said, &quot;I do beseech you not to give 
up yet. If my heroic knight does but show up, I promise we will all be 
delivered safely.&quot; her voice trailed off at the end as she and the 
others suddenly heard sounds coming up the steps of the tower.

&quot;The dragon!&quot; Lady Michiru cried fearfully as Duchess Setsuna tried to 
bravely face her impending death, the lone tear running down her right 
cheek the only outward sign of her fear.

Then from the stairs, the four captives did hear...

Smack!

&quot;Ow!&quot;

&quot;Hey, leave him alone.&quot;

&quot;Quiet pickle-puss!&quot;

Thump!

&quot;Ah, my head!&quot;

Slowly, wearily, the four remaining knights staggered into the room. Sir 
Ruka sported a black eye, Ami a small bruise on her forehead above her 
left eyebrow, and Mina&#39;s hands were both badly burned. Rei alone seemed 
the least injured, suffering but a small scrape to her knee when she and 
the others were knocked to the ground by the dragon swooping down just 
above them.

As the three squires now came into the room behind the knights, Sir Ruka 
of Butch did use the sword she retrieved after the dragon was slain to 
cut the shackles of the Princess and her Ladies in Waiting.

&quot;Sir Ruka!&quot; Lady Michiru said, reaching out her hand to examine the 
sandy-blonde&#39;s injured eye. Ruka intercepted her however, taking the 
musician&#39;s soft hand in hers.

&quot;It was worth it, milady.&quot; The knight said, &quot;To see you and those 
beautiful eyes of yours I did fall in love with at Court once again safe 
and sound.&quot; She then bent low and gallantly kissed the back of the young 
maiden&#39;s hand.

&quot;Good Sir Knight!&quot; Setsuna said as she looked at Mina&#39;s burnt palms, 
&quot;You... you did this for us?&quot;

&quot;For you, fair Duchess,&quot; Sir Mina said as she looked into Setsuna&#39;s 
violet eyes, &quot;I would fight the devil himself, if the prize were your 
heart.&quot;

&quot;Um...&quot; Sir Ami of Grey-Matter began shyly as she stood in front of Lady 
Makoto, &quot;I, um...&quot; she was cut off as the taller young woman suddenly 
pulled her into a hug, burying the blushing knight&#39;s face into her 
bosom.

&quot;My hero.&quot; Makoto gushed as she then bent over, kissing the brave Sir 
Knight on the lips.

Rei looked on smilingly as her fellow knights won the fair damsels of 
their dreams. Her smile faded as Princess Serenity came over.

&quot;Brave Sir Knight,&quot; she said, &quot;Sir Rei of the Sacred Flame, I pray thee; 
where is Prince Endymion the Hapless? What happened to him?&quot;

Sir Rei sighed while the three squires tried to whistle innocently as 
they began to make their way to the exit.

&quot;He... He was killed in the battle milady.&quot; Sir Rei answered.

The Princess looked deep into the knight&#39;s dark eyes for a few seconds, 
then, &quot;You... were the one who killed the dragon, weren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Aye.&quot; Sir Rei answered nodding her head, &quot;It was I who slew the foul 
beast.&quot;

Princess Serenity then surprised good Sir Rei by embracing the 
raven-haired warrior.

&quot;I knew you would,&quot; she said as she reached up and put her hand behind 
the knight&#39;s head, &quot;My heroic knight.&quot; she whispered before pulling her 
champion into a loving kiss.

And so the brave group of knights and their fair maidens left the dark 
stone tower behind and returned to Crystal Tokyo, where they all lived 
happily ever after.

Except for Seiya and Yaten, who continued to get the shit beat out of 
them by Taiki on a regular basis.
