<h1>Break the Silence (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/aeagle.html">April Eagle</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&gt;I can imagine the moment
Breaking out through the silence
All the things that we both might say

And the heart it will not be denied
&#39;Til we&#39;re both on the same damn side
All the barriers blown away &lt;

Peter Gabriel

Author&#39;s note:
This is a story about Haruka and Michiru . The time isn&#39;t important. 
Haruka and Michiru know each other for over two years and they got to 
know Sailor Moon and her team. They are still looking after the 
talismans, but this time it is not as busy as in the anime. Haruka and 
Michiru are in love with each other but neither of them dare to talk to 
each other.

For all those people who know Japan or are even living in it: I am 
sorry. I don&#39;t know if Japan has such mountains as I describe them in 
this story. If not, please forgive me.

The actual meaning of the song &quot;Come talk to me&quot; is another one, but I 
think the lines are suitable. I love this song very much and I think 
everyone knows how hard it is to talk about personal feelings.

It&#39;s never been easy to talk about love.

prologue: dancing dolphins

Bright sunlight burned from a cloudless sky at the world beneath. Busy
cars forced their way through the big streets that divided the big
city. They lurched like snakes between the huge sky scrapers. Steam
and fog laid over the hot asphalt.

Outside the city the noise died slightly away and green trees and wide
meadows covered the ground. Small houses could be seen overall between
the high trees. They seemed to fit into this picture of nature next to
the industrial giant. The rushes of the near ocean could be heard as
well as the sweet singing of the birds all around. Lots of people
walked through the huge park at the outer ring of Tokyo. They enjoyed
the nice weather, their free time or simply their pension. Young
people walked next to old ones. The isolation of the big city didn&#39;t
exist here anymore. People were greeting each other although they
didn&#39;t actually know why. Children played at the playground or seek
and hide between the bushes. Loving mothers watched them happy. Some
dogs barked and followed existed tiny sticks. Couples passed the sandy
ways holding their hands.

Bright sunlight burned from an cloudless sky through the window of a
small shop in the middle of the park. There mostly souvenirs were
sold. Souvenirs for the tourists that visited Tokyo each day.
Souvenirs... And if you opened you eyes and looked around quite well
you could find treasures between tiny copies of the Tokyo Tower or
cheap pictures of the great ocean that started behind the green oasis
as the people called it.

Two ear rings sparkled in the hand of a young woman. She took off her
sun glasses and her deep green eyes watched the diamonds thoughtfully.
Sparkling jewels formed the eyes of jumping dolphins. The silver skin
of the animals shimmered blue and remembered the young woman of the
endless sea. And of two blue eyes she loved so much...

&quot;They are very cute, aren&#39;t they?&quot; The shop assistant, a young woman
of almost twenty years, appeared next to her and looked over her
shoulder. Then she looked around in the small shop and wrinkled her
front. &quot;I didn&#39;t realize that we have such ear rings.&quot; She ran a
steady hand through her long red hair. That happened often. The small
shop was so inoverwieving that people often found things she didn&#39;t
even know they were there.

The young woman took a deep breathe then she looked up.

&quot;I&#39;ll take them.&quot; She declared in a low voice and went over to the
counter with the shop assistant.

&quot;Shall I wrap them up?&quot; As the young woman just nodded fought the
young shop assistant with the paper. It was too big but she had no
scissors. So she talked to cover her awkwardness.

&quot;Are you from here? Or are you a tourist?&quot; she asked politely and
rolled her eyes as she heard the crash of the door when her younger
sister entered the small shop.

&quot;Hey, Yako. How do you do?&quot; Another girl with red but short hair went
over to the counter and grinned at the young woman. Her eyes went over
the long blue jeans and the wide black shirt the customer was wearing.
She piped appreciative.

&quot;If I had known that you would have such nice guys in you shop I...&quot;

&quot;Go to university and study!&quot; declared the other sister and finally
won the battle with the big paper.

&quot;It&#39;s too hot for learning! By the way what does he buy?&quot; asked the
smaller sister curiously and grinned again at the young woman who
smiled back and took her sun glasses into her right hand.

&quot;Ear rings. Dolphins with diamonds.&quot;

&quot;O, I didn&#39;t realize that we have such ear rings. That we have ear
rings at all.&quot;

&quot;Me neither. But granny does the buying so I doesn&#39;t wonder about
anything.&quot;

&quot;Our loving granny... I am hungry. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s time for
dinner?&quot; The pleading expression of the smaller sister&#39;s face was so
funny that the young woman giggled.

&quot;Here you are.&quot; The shop assistant gave the small box to the customer
and sighed. &quot;Why don&#39;t you just go and cook something for yourself?
You&#39;re old enough!&quot; she scolded but her little sister didn&#39;t even
listen to her. She just followed the young woman.

&quot;Do you have any appointments this evening?&quot; She asked and didn&#39;t even
blush to talk to strange men in such an open way.

&quot;Asuka!&quot;

The young woman took her sun glasses on. The smile on her face froze.
Then she left the shop and went away.

&quot;Asuka! You&#39;re crazy!&quot; could she hear the older sister scolding while
she walked along the sandy way looking up to the cloudless sky.

&quot;Yako!&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t you think that he&#39;s already a nice girlfriend? What do
you think for whom were these wonderful ear rings?&quot; &quot;O, then his
girlfriend is lucky. She must be something special.&quot;

The voices died away as she walked deeper into the park.

Something special...

The young woman thought at shinning blue eyes, at long sea green hairs
that felt velvet and at a smiling face that always seemed so
understanding. At two small hands that could play the violin in a
tender way that touched her heart each time she heard the soft
melodies.

Something special.

&quot;Hai...&quot;

Michiru is indeed something special.

Haruka sighed slightly and risk a look down her watch and knew that
she was too late. The others already waited for her. She should hurry
up.

***

The girl sat on the bank. The wind was playing with her short blue
hair and the white skirt she was wearing. Birds sung and the leaves of
the trees around rushed. But she didn&#39;t even mention it. All she saw
was the thick book she hold in her hands. Her blue eyes behind glasses
shimmered as they followed endless lines of written words.

&quot;He! What are you doing here so alone?&quot; A man sat down next to her and
grabbed her shoulder. The girl looked up very puzzled and the book
fell upon the sandy ground.

&quot;Leave me in peace!&quot; she demanded and wanted to pick up her book as he
hold her back.

&quot;You remember me of my former girlfriend.&quot; He said and she could smell
the alcohol. &quot;Are you as good as she was?&quot; The man asked and came
nearer.

&quot;Get off me!&quot; demanded the girl. This time her voice was louder. And a
little bit more frightened, too.

&quot;Hey, small one! Don&#39;t be so shy. I know you want it, too.&quot; He smiled
and she could see a bad expression on his face. His hands hurt more
and more upon her shoulders and she wasn&#39;t strong enough to escape.

&quot;No...&quot; she winced as he tried to force her to give him a kiss.

&quot;NO!!!&quot; She screamed and hold up her hands protectively in front of
her head. He just slapped them away and hit her in her face.

&quot;No...&quot; she stammered and suddenly tears were running down her burning
cheeks. The glasses landed in the grass and it cracked as the glass
sprung.

&quot;Yes!&quot; declared the young man and grinned satisfied as he felt that
she was too weak to defend herself seriously enough.

&quot;She said &gt;noYou lesbian!&lt;

Haruka hold her hands up to her ears but she couldn&#39;t stop the rude
voice inside her head. It followed her the whole evening. Again she
saw that hateful look of the fat man at the parking space as she hold
the soft hands of her Michiru.

Again she saw the disappointment in the young musician&#39;s face as she
didn&#39;t want to talk about her problems. Michiru would never
understand. Would she?

She&#39;s always so understanding. She accepts my passion to fast cars.
She isn&#39;t affected about my male behaviour. She never loses a word
about my messing room. Or about my terrible cooking. She just listens
to my problems and tries to solve them.

Haruka sighed and laid back in the sand. Her eyes shone treacherously
as she looked up at the sky that was covered with thousands of stars.

&quot;Hai, Michi-chan is very understanding...&quot; whispered the young car
racer and swallowed hard. Then she covered her face with her cold
hands.

But she&#39;s surely not so understanding to accept that I love her...

For almost an hour Haruka laid there. Motionless. In silence. She
thought at the young violinist who declared her that she was Sailor
Uranus. That her destiny would be the search of the talismans and the
saving of the world. She remembered Michiru inviting her to live in
her huge house that was too big for one person. For the first time in
her life Haruka got her own room. She got new clothes and the car keys
of the wonderful silver Ferrari. She got the chance to start a career
as a car racer. And she got the possibility to talk to a friendly
young woman who listened to her. Who comforted her after she talked
about her sad childhood for the first time after her parents died. For
the first time in her whole life. And surely for the last time.

Michiru gave her so much...

I got a friend. My best friend. My only friend...

Michiru gave her so much. It wasn&#39;t fair of Haruka to thank her by
telling her about her strange feelings. About her love to her.

Haruka sighed and stood up quietly. She didn&#39;t want to lose Michiru
because of these feelings. And she didn&#39;t want Michiru to be treated
the rude way she was by other people. By other people who recognized
that she wasn&#39;t a man although she looked and behaved like one.

She&#39;s my only ray of light in this dark world.

Slowly Haruka went back to her motorbike and sat up.

What should I do without her?

The young car racer turned her motorbike and speeded up. It was a
question she couldn&#39;t answer. Because all answers she found were too
sad.

***

It was about five o&#39;clock in the morning. It was almost dawn. The
horizon already wore the colours of light blue and the ocean started
to glimmer.

Haruka woke up and laid silently in her bed while she tried to calm
down her body. Sweat covered her face and she run a steady hand though
her short and wet blonde hair. Her yellow pyjama felt also wet and she
wanted to take a shower as always when she tried to ignore her
nightmares.

She reached over to the table that stood next to the bed and switched
on the light. For a long time she stared at the framed picture she
found on her pillow as she returned home late at night. It showed
herself who sat on a tiny wooden pony on the playground. Michiru sat
behind her and had wrapped her arms around her waist. She looked over
her shoulder and laughed happily into the camera.

We both are laughing...

They went to the playground with Usagi and the others about a months
ago. It was a nice day and they had a lot of fun. The outer senshi
almost forgot their dangerous mission and in a moment of happiness Rei
took that picture.

Haruka couldn&#39;t take her look from the lucky shinning face of her
Michi-chan.

Why does she give it to me?

She didn&#39;t find an answer on this question, too.

At that moment she heard the soft voice of the violin that filled the
cool air of the night. The melody was very sad and full of despair. It
didn&#39;t stop at the end of the song. It just settled into a next one
until it changed into a imaged melody. Heavy notes in a strange order.

Haruka stood up and went upstairs to the room where the moaning melody
was born. Quietly she opened the door and could see Michiru on the
balcony. She stood in the corner. Her face was turned towards the
endless ocean but the young car racer knew that her eyes were shut.

&quot;Michi-chan?&quot; she whispered as she entered the balcony. The melody
broke and left a bitter sweet aftertaste. The young musician spun
around and Haruka could see the sparkling tears that fell down her
pale cheeks. Michiru put carefully her instrument down on the wide
handrail and slowly walked over to the young car racer. Without saying
a word she wrapped her arms around Haruka&#39;s neck and pulled her hot
face against the young woman&#39;s shoulder.

Haruka didn&#39;t react at the first seconds. Then she heard the oppressed
sobs of the smaller senshi. And she felt the shaking that went through
the slim body.

She&#39;s too slim.

The young car racer took her small musician into her arms and rocked
her gently.

She has too many problems.

&quot;You had this nightmare, too?&quot; she asked quietly and felt how Michiru
nodded against her shoulder. Silently she sighed and looked down at
the trembling young woman in her strong arms. Carefully she stroke the
velvet hairs while the other one cried. Tears shimmered also in Haruka
eyes, but she fought them back successfully. She didn&#39;t want Michiru
to see her cry. She didn&#39;t want her Michi-chan to be more concerned
than she already was. One of them had to have the strength to show
that life carried on. It always did. Haruka knew it too well...

We have too many problems...

&quot;Our enemies found a new victim. We should be there to see if they&#39;re
lucky. If this victim owns a talisman in his heart.&quot; Whispered Haruka
and could feel how Michiru&#39;s arms squeezed her harder. As if she was
the only life line in the dark life of the talented musician.

&quot;Ruka...&quot; answered Michiru in a strange voice and coughed. &quot;I don&#39;t
know if I am able to...&quot; Again a shaking went through her body and
more tears fell.

&quot;I don&#39;t know it either, Michi-chan. But it&#39;s our mission as you know.
Otherwise the whole world is going to end. All people will die if we
don&#39;t prevent the messiah of silence to be born.&quot;

&quot;But one life for six million lives...&quot; cried Michiru and rose her
head to look straight into Haruka&#39;s also pale face. She could see the
determined expression on the young car racer&#39;s face and knew what she
would say next. It were the same words she always said in such a
discussion.

&quot;It&#39;s our destiny to full fill this mission. We aren&#39;t asked if we&#39;re
able to...&quot; Haruka swallowed hard and turned her head to look out to
the endless ocean. The steady rushes of the sea seemed to call her
down. External.

&quot;... to kill anyone. And no one asked if it&#39;s fair enough to sacrifice
one person for the rest of the world. Well, at last it&#39;s not fair for
this single person. But the rest of the people will survive. Usagi and
her friends will survive. Although someone else has to die for this
peace.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s no peace!&quot; said Michiru in a suddenly icy voice. Haruka looked
at her pale face again and could see the angry expression in it.

She never argued after these unchangeable words before.

&quot;Just think of the family of this person. Of her parents. Of her
children. Of her lover...&quot; Deep despair shone in the tears that slowed
down. Wind ran through the long sea green hairs and Haruka felt how
Michiru pulled her nearer to hold her tight.

&quot;It&#39;s better for us not to think about it.&quot; Declared Haruka and her
voice sounded insensible. But both of them knew that she wasn&#39;t.

&quot;But...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s our mission and we have to full fill it. The destiny of the
world depends on us. We can&#39;t let this tragedy happen.&quot; Haruka wanted
to return into the bedroom but Michiru hold her tighter. She didn&#39;t
want her car racer to let go. And Haruka knew that she didn&#39;t want to
leave her young violinist either. They needed each other. Without the
other one they would never have come so far. Living.

&quot;Besides it doesn&#39;t mean...&quot;

&quot;But I would never sacrifice one person for this bloody world if that
person was you!&quot; The scream interrupted the words of the taller woman.
Green eyes grew wide and stared in disbelieve in desperate blue ones.

How did she meant it?

Please, don&#39;t leave me!

For some moments they stood their in silence just watching each other.
None of them dared to say a word. None of them knew what to say best.

Finally Michiru lowered her head and leaned it against Haruka&#39;s chest.
She could feel her breasts through the yellow pyjama the young car
racer wore instead of night dresses. Michiru actually never seen the
senshi of the wind in a dress. Haruka hated the costume she had to
wear as Sailor Uranus and she would never voluntarily wear anything
else than her blue jeans and her wide shirts.

But it didn&#39;t matter to Michiru. She liked her tomboy and it was alike
what she wore.

&quot;Hey, you know only a person with a pure heart owns a talisman. So you
can&#39;t sacrifice me.&quot; Joked Haruka after a while and was very glad that
it was too dark outside. Otherwise Michiru would have seen that the
cool car racer blushed deeply.

She let off Michiru and went into the bedroom.

&quot;Better I&#39;ll care for the tickets that we&#39;re at the party before our
enemies arrive there.&quot; She said and opened the door as she heard the
quiet voice behind her.

&quot;R... Ruka?&quot;

Haruka slowly turned her head and could see Michiru who stood next to
the huge bed. She had protectively wrapped her arms around her slim
chest. The blue night shirt she wore moved in the wind that blew
through the open balcony door. Her hair fell over her shoulders and
shadows hide her face. Obstinately she stared at the carpet down
below.

She looks so fragile...

&quot;Hai?&quot;

&quot;Please...&quot; Michiru swallowed hard and didn&#39;t look up. &quot;Please stay
for the rest of the night. I... I don&#39;t want to be alone after this
horrible... nightmare...&quot; The young violinist sighed and shook
slightly her head. It was too much she asked from the independent car
racer. She knew it.

Thoughtless she winced as she heard how the door closed.

I am silly that I asked.

Again Michiru sighed and suddenly froze in her thin night shirt. She
knew that it was alike how much blankets she would use. The next hours
until she had to get up she would freeze like hell. She shut her eyes
and just stood there motionless. She didn&#39;t want to think about the
next day. Maybe they would find one of the talismans. Maybe they would
be forced to kill...

No I am not silly. I am jut so tired of this all.

Michiru&#39;s eyes flew open as she felt the soft blanket that suddenly
covered her trembling body. She rose her head and looked straight into
two green eyes. An expression laid on Haruka&#39;s face she&#39;d never seen
before. She couldn&#39;t explain. She couldn&#39;t define.

But she wasn&#39;t scared about it. Oppositely she felt safe and secure as
Haruka pulled her down on the soft bed and laid down next to her.
Wordlessly she took one of Michiru&#39;s cold hands in her warm one and
held it tight.

&quot;Are you cold?&quot; asked the young car racer after a while they just laid
in silence and listened to the steady waves of the near ocean.

&quot;No, not anymore. Thanks.&quot; Michiru shut her eyes and concentrated on
the tender touch. Everything seemed to be less important as she
settled into sleep. Yes, here she felt free. With her Ruka next to
her. No one could harm her as long as she wasn&#39;t alone.

No, I am not alone.

A smile appeared on Michiru&#39;s pale face as she entered the dream world
and left all her problems behind.

Haruka squeezed the small hand gentle and looked down at the senshi of
the endless ocean. She didn&#39;t want to see her Michi-chan cry. She
wanted to see her happy. To see her laughing the whole day. But she
knew she wouldn&#39;t. Not as long as their mission lasted.

And afterwards?

Haruka sighed slightly and laid her head back on the soft pillow.
I want to love her. But she deserves a better life. She shouldn&#39;t be
called bad words by old intolerant men. She should bee free and not be
bound at a sick person like me.

Haruka silently watched the ceiling while the sun set. The room got
brighter with every minute. Michiru next to her slept deep and tight.

No more nightmares disturbed her dreams.

I don&#39;t want her to be called a lesbian.

The car racer didn&#39;t find any sleep the rest of the night.
