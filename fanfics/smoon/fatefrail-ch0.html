<h1>Fate and Frailty (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakaako.html">bakaako</a><br> </h2>
<pre>+Author&#39;s Note+

Began at February 10, 2006.

The mystery of the protagonist and the antagonist&#39;s identity was 
deliberate. You can play guessing games all you want, I&#39;m not telling 
cheeky grin

All the haikus you will find are mine.

+Source of Inspiration+

This fic was inspired by Kirika&#39;s &quot;Absence&quot;; Crawlspace&#39;s &quot;The Cruelty 
and Fairness of Fate&quot;; and a conversation between bored insomniacs on 
the bajillion ways one could do with Pluto&#39;s Time staff. Of course, I 
shouldn&#39;t forget to add that Jessica&#39;s &quot;Power Transcendent&quot; is my newest 
source inspiration as well. I love how she writes...

Is anyone starting to suspect a pattern here? Heheh... Of course, I&#39;m 
not ripping anyone off... The theme may seem unoriginal but the plot 
isn&#39;t.

----------

How do you begin.
A story without endings.
Softly close your eyes...

Prologue

She could see nothing.

Blood is dripping... there was nothing else but...

It oozed out from the gash, covered the remaining distance between torn 
skin and the floor, then it collected into a puddle. It was all a quiet, 
rapid process that is the process of dying. But for someone whose senses 
were impaired, and with hearing the only thing left functional, the 
staccato sound of dripping sounded like a sledgehammer pounding away 
against her skull.

Then she was aware of her head jerking to the side... something hitting 
her with enough force to cause such an involuntary motion. Then she felt 
her hair being pulled, her head lifting in the process, and someone 
leaned in close to hiss in her ear, &quot;Stupid human, you ruined 
everything...&quot;

If she could laugh she would-- the sound would be hollow and bitter. And 
if she could speak, the words would be, &quot;Right back at you, bitch.&quot; 
Maybe she didn&#39;t need to say those things... Perhaps the expression on 
her face was enough, because the grip on her hair tightened-- and the 
paralysis, that had delayed her body from succumbing to the trauma of 
its fatal injury, faded away.

The pain was unbearable.

&quot;Simply a taste of what I have done to your friends.&quot; The voice&#39;s icy 
amusement was obvious, the kind of unfeeling quality that rolled the 
words so cruelly-- with no hint of the anger that had burst out from her 
nemesis earlier. &quot;Do you remember how many times we have done this? Are 
you not tired of dying again and again? Seeing your friends die again 
and again? Wouldn&#39;t it be simpler to just let me win?&quot;

&quot;Never!&quot; She choked out.

&quot;Hm.&quot; The click-clack of heels and the sharp pounding of a staff rang in 
her ear as the unseen enemy moved... circling her like a vulture would 
around its prey. &quot;Of course you wouldn&#39;t... because that would be out of 
character, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot; It chuckled. &quot;But I am closer to victory now... 
I can feel it. I have almost perfected the game. I will go to each 
alternate reality again and again... destroying and creating... until 
you wear out. And finally I win. It is inevitable.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t brag... It&#39;s unbecoming...&quot; She mocked. And the instant the words 
left her mouth, a swift kick was delivered to her ribs. She howled in 
agony, choked, then laughed. Laughing made the pain worse. But it felt 
good. If there was one thing SHE perfected in all of this 
dimension-hopping business it was her sarcasm. &quot;Why do you sound so 
sure?&quot; She said at last, the hilarity dying away and leaving an empty 
feeling inside her. &quot;Some destinies change, and some don&#39;t. Our destiny 
is fixed--&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot;

&quot;You realize that, don&#39;t you... No matter how many times you go to 
different worlds to change things--&quot;

&quot;SILENCE!&quot;

&quot;--your sick dream will never come tr--&quot;

She felt herself being hurled in the air as the burning blast of the 
Time staff&#39;s Dead Scream hit her. She collided with a wall, which gave 
out against the power of the impact and caused dust and debris to fly 
everywhere.

Then there was silence.

Then there was maniacal laughter. When it died away, the following words 
were uttered with quiet and untarnished conviction, &quot;You&#39;re right... I 
knew this from the from the beginning. But each time I failed, I got 
stronger... However, I did not expect my success to be delayed this 
long. Thanks to you, I am unstoppable. On the NEXT world... My paradise 
WILL be realized. Even something as inconsequential as destiny cannot 
touch me now.&quot; There was a pause.

She couldn&#39;t feel the pain anymore. But she knew it was not because of 
the paralysis like last time... She was startled when the genderless 
voice whispered directly in her ear, its tone was full of honest 
sympathy, &quot;I admit... You are one of the most annoying and persistent of 
pests... You have challenged me more than any other. But this is the 
last chase for you.&quot;

She couldn&#39;t feel pain anymore... Finally... There was nothing at all.
