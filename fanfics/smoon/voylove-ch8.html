<p>Discussion with the  Princess-tachi</p>
<p>“Promise me, Rei-chan?”</p>
<p>Rei rolled her eyes as Mina stood  before her, one hand innocently behind her back, and the other  extending a pinky. Reluctantly, she proffered her own pinky. “I  promise, Mina.”</p>
<p>After Mina finished with her little  pinky promise chant, she brought Rei into a sudden tight embrace.   “Give them my best regards, okay? And take care of yourself.”</p>
<p>Returning the hug, Rei nodded into her  shoulder. “I will. You take care too, all right? I'm leaving  you almost alone to care for the crew yourself.”</p>
<p>With a grin, Mina pulled back and  waggled her finger between them. “I'm the leader of eight  headstrong girls- <em>and</em> I'm the  Senshi of Love. I can handle this crew no problem.”</p>
<p>Shaking her head  hopelessly, Rei gave Mina a quick peck on the cheek before moving to  cross to the other ship. But Mina would have none of that, not  without a properly extended kiss goodbye. With her own cheeks  flushed, Mina waved goodbye as Rei crossed the makeshift bridge in a  slightly dazed fashion.</p>
<p>On the other side,  she was immediately tugged into another hug, which made her stomach  roll over with guilt. But she obliged the Princess and hugged her  back, before pulling away.</p>
<p>“Rei-chan it  feels like it's been so long! How are you? How are the rest of the  Senshi doing? Why aren't they crossing too? Rei-chan? Why-”</p>
<p>“Slow down,  Princess! I'll answer you in a minute. Let's get out of the sun-  this might take a little while.”</p>
<p>Reluctantly, the  Princess backed off, though she tugged Rei's arm towards what  happened to be the nearest cabin. “Come on then- everyone's  waiting!”</p>
<p>Cordial greetings  were given and taken between the Senshi before they all seated  themselves. The Princess remained the first to prompt, “So,  Rei-chan? How are you? Is everything all right?” In her  knowledge that taking it slow would mean that more questions would be  answered, the Princess paused at that point.</p>
<p>Rei let out a  soft, calming exhale before she answered, “I'm fine, Princess.   So are the other Senshi. Everything is going as well as could be  expected.”</p>
<p>At this, Setsuna  cut in, “And what, if I may ask, were you expecting?”</p>
<p>Turning to look at  the Senshi of Time, Rei verified, “Do you mean what the plan  was?” At her nod, Rei continued, “Well, I suppose I  should get this out of the way first. See, it's like this. About  three days ago, Mina and I were talking, and as you know, her uncle  set up the voyage to make sure that her surprise wouldn't be ruined,  in such a way that she wouldn't cause much trouble. Naturally, if  you know Mina, if she doesn't have something worthwhile, or at least  a bit interesting to do, she, by default, becomes bored. A bored  Mina is a more-unpredictable-than-ever Mina. It just so happens that  the Zephyr came into view at that moment, and that capricious persona  of Mina's suggested that we become pirates, if for no other reason  than to keep our hands tied. I apologize if this has caused you any  undue worry.”</p>
<p>As they digested  the information, all were quiet. Finally, Ami asked, “You  agreed to this, Rei? That isn't like you.”</p>
<p>Calming making  sure that a blush didn't give her away, Rei responded, “I  surprised myself too. But I've been with Haruka and Makoto before  while they were pirates- they're good hosts.”</p>
<p>The Princess  jolted at that. “When? When did you see them as pirates,  before this week? I didn't hear of that.”</p>
<p>Rei assured her  softly. “They hadn't taken over the ship at that point, but  they already had influence. I think it was around... ten, eleven  years ago?”</p>
<p>Ami did some quick  calculating. “It was during that visit to see your  grandfather? That's why you were delayed, wasn't it?”</p>
<p>A solemn nod was  her answer. Michiru then asked, “How can you trust them so  easily? They betrayed the Kingdom once- they can do it again.”</p>
<p>The Princess  whimpered in protest at that. “It wasn't their fault! They  got kidnapped last time, didn't they?”</p>
<p>Again, Rei nodded.   “Perhaps it would be more of a reassurance to know that Haruka  and Makoto never turned their backs on the Kingdom. They're simply  protecting the Kingdom on the perimeter. Haven't you ever wondered  why we were never successfully invaded?”</p>
<p>Cluelessly naïve,  the Princess squeaked, “A good military?”</p>
<p>“Working on  the tip-offs from a certain pair of Pirate Senshi.” When no  one seemed to have nothing more to ask, Rei turned the tables on  them, so to speak. “What about you? What are you doing out in  the middle of nowhere?”</p>
<p>Setsuna was the  one to answer. “Assuring ourselves of the truth. Allow me to  verify what you have informed us of as of thus. You boarded the  pirate's vessel on account of Minako-san becoming bored. The pair of  Senshi already settled on said vessel are merely an undercover  scouting and guarding the rim of the Kingdom from invaders. Is that  all the necessary information, or is there something else you would  like to tell us?”</p>
<p>Rei  considered it briefly before shaking her head. “No, that's it.   I-”</p>
<p>“You're lying.” Michiru's  accusation was sharp enough that had it been possible, it would have  beheaded the cool atmosphere.</p>
<p>“What makes you think I'm  lying?”</p>
<p>Setsuna cut in, “The future  would not be as it currently seems, if that was all there was to it.”</p>
<p>Rei sighed and muttered, “And  here I thought your personal saying was 'the future is not set in  stone'.”</p>
<p>“It isn't,” Setsuna  agreed, “But from what I glimpsed just the other day, something  occurred aboard the Zephyr that altered the timeline.”</p>
<p>At that, Rei raised her eyebrow. “You  don't say? How so?”</p>
<p>“It is not my current concern to  tell you.”</p>
<p>“Well then, it is not <em>my</em> current concern to tell you either.”</p>
<p>Before Setsuna  could object, the Princess informed them, as proud as a hen that had  laid her first hen, “I know why she wants to keep it a secret.   Rei-chan's in <em>love</em>.”</p>
<p>If thoughts of her  Mina hadn't already flushed Rei's cheeks, the Princess' declaration  did, which all the more proved that she was right. If it was  possible, Ami's complexion became a darker red than Rei's as her  notorious shirking of love made itself known again. Michiru however,  held a slightly amused expression, as she measured Rei's depth of  feeling with the help of her mirror. She held up exceedingly well to  the test.</p>
<p>“This love,”  Setsuna began, her eyebrows knitted in a rare moment of uncertainty,  “It wouldn't happen to involve a fellow Senshi, would it?”</p>
<p>Rei turned her  head away from the inquisitive looks, and only responded with a  simple, “None of your business.”</p>
<p>At the sudden  pressure on her wrist, Rei twisted to see the doleful look in the  Princess' eyes. “Rei-chan, you know I have a right to know, as  your Princess <em>and</em> as your friend.”</p>
<p>Before Rei could  even consider answering her, however, the ship suffered drastic  turbulence as something crashed into it. Even as they all rushed out  to assess the damage, Rei knew where it had come from, and cursed her  own stupidity, on top of Mina's.</p>
