<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When I’m Sober<br />
</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Four  women marched down the halls of the Moon Palace. Formal gowns swished  from side to side. Three sets of heels effortlessly matched pace. One  was more than slightly off kilter.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei snarled. “I told you I <em>hate</em> these outfits.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I think I’ve made it abundantly clear that I.Don’t.Care.” Minako smiled and winked at the irritated Priestess.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami  raised an eyebrow at Makoto. The taller woman simply hid a snicker  behind her hand at Rei’s plight. At least now they were fairly  confident in their understanding as to why their leader had asked them  to dress up for what had seemed like no reason.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here we are,” Minako announced as she swung open the heavy doors to the Princess’ outdoor courtyard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lying  on her stomach in the soft grass of a small garden in the court’s  center, Princess Serenity turned to the intrusion and her eyes lit up  upon seeing her guardians. As they approached, Serenity was quick to  rearrange the holographic images displayed before her, quickly sending  the image on top behind the rest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She rose daintily, patting at the bits of grass that clung to her flowing white dress before trotting to her friends.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  was her first target and she wrapped her arms around the stiff  Martian’s bare shoulders. “Rei-chan, your hair looks wonderful in a  braid! You should wear it this way more often.” She said this sagely as  her fingers toyed with the thick, ebony tail.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ch’.” Rei cursed. “Whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  scowled in the Priestess’ general direction but Rei had discovered her  mistake too late, and the woman who had braided her hair in the first  place turned a cold shoulder, even as Serenity abandoned Rei for the  Venusian.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be upset, Mina-chan, I’ll bet your hair would look beautiful braided too!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  chuckled, all traces of animosity gone as she returned her Princess’  feverish embrace. Before she knew it, the woman was flittering off  towards her other two guardians, eager to dote as equally on Makoto and  Ami.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei watched this unabashed display of affection with a  detached fondness, a distant smile on her lips. The Princess was  endearing, indeed, and she found herself envious of the ease at which  Serenity displayed her emotions.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Unlike someone else I know.’</em> Rei mused, even if she was completely aware that she wasn’t only referring to Minako, but herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Feeling  familiar eyes on her, she turned to the Venusian, who snapped her gaze  away once she’d been caught. Minako stuck her nose to the air with a  quiet “Hmpff.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When the exuberant Princess could finally be  coaxed into relaxing, the five women spread themselves about on the  grass of the courtyard. Serenity’s hands were clasped within the leader  of her senshi’s.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ne, Mina-chan, Mother tells me that the youma  invasions on the other planets might be tied to planet Earth.” Watery  eyes implored her guardian. “Tell me it isn’t so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian  smiled sadly. She wished nothing more than to tell Serenity what she  hoped to hear but she loved her charge too much as to blatantly lie.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Our  last mission indicated that this is the case, Princess,” those blue  eyes lowered to the ground and for Minako, it was akin to a punch in  the gut, “but we still have more research to do, and the conclusion is <em>not</em> final.” She urged. And even as that excited sparkle returned to the  Princess’ eyes, Minako chastised herself for allowing for false hope.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You do love the Earth so, don’t you, Serenity-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami’s gentle voice was a boon to the young woman, and she nodded eagerly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As if <em>this</em> were any clue,” Makoto chuckled deeply, reaching for the transparent  tiles of the stack of holograms that the Princess had all but  forgotten. The Jovian’s fingers touched the topmost tile, and the  transparent image sprang into bright, vivid colors. It displayed in  great clarity an island nation surrounded by a brilliant, aqua ocean.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nippon.” Ami said sagely. “Earth’s ruling nation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Princess nodded and Makoto tapped the image to display the next - a  wooded valley from which tall green and rocky cliffs surrounded three  sides. A river meandered around this valley and in its center, a stone  city stood as an imposing fortress.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Edo. Nippon’s capital.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serenity  nodded once more, and Makoto cycled through several more images of the  city’s noteworthy attractions while the Jovian’s counterpart was quick  to rattle off the names of each.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But nearing the last image, Serenity’s hand reached out hesitatingly, and Ami’s voice hitched in her throat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  image of a tall, dark haired man sporting a black cloak and shoulder  armor sat on a throne. His deep brown eyes seemed very kind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s eyes narrowed perceptibly as she examined that image.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…Prince… Endymion.” Ami finally said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serenity  grabbed the images and they winked back into faint, transparent tiles.  “It’s a part of my studies.” She was quick to clarify.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami fidgeted slightly. “Of course, Princess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  drew herself up, assuming her station. “Lets discuss out next steps.”  The women took the distraction eagerly, Serenity included. “We don’t  know for sure that Earth holds the answer to the youma invasion.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  practically glared daggers, but the Venusian forced herself to ignore  the other woman. The rest of her senshi gave her mixed looks and she  tempered their concern by shifting her eyes in Serenity’s direction.<br />
  “And we can’t just march onto Earth looking for answers and do as we wish.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why not?” Rei demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because the Earth is a <em>protected place</em>.” Minako nearly hissed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei-san,”  Ami urged, too eager to quell the tension between the two willful women  with her gentle knowledge, “The Moon Kingdom designated the Earth as  neutral territory and declared themselves protectors of that planet  three years ago. However…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her voice quieted and she cast her  gaze at her Princess. “The Earth seems to be growing weary of the Moon  of late. They had initially agreed to the arrangement when Prince  Endymion and their ruling class met here for discussions three years  ago, but the people of that planet seem to be changing their minds. The  general consensus is that the Moon Kingdom is holding them under our  thumb, and reports indicate that they grow mistrustful of our intent,  and harbor fears of our long life spans, wealth, and technological  powers.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako snorted, and sniped at Rei. “You’d know all this  if you barbarians would pull your head out of your civil wars once in  awhile.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We just want to help them.” Serenity’s voice was a sad whisper.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s  mouth shut with an audible click. She hadn’t the heart to continue to  argue a point that had already passed with the Venusian.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto laid a supportive hand on her Princess’ shoulder. “We’ll try our best.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Talks  are slated to start soon,” Ami informed Rei, “between the Earth and the  Moon. Hopefully, we can clear up some of the misunderstandings.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  in the meantime, Earth is to remain off limits.” Minako reinforced.  “We’ll develop another plan to gather information on the youma threat.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto rested her chin in her hand. “We’ll be torn in many different directions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Venusian nodded. “We’ll be tasked with attending the talks with the  Earth, ongoing research of the youma threat, and I’m declaring that our  guard of the Princess should increase soon as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This comment  was met with a whine from the woman in question. Minako smiled  indulgently and squeezed Serenity’s hand. “We have to ensure your  safety. No more missions like our last one. One of us will always be by  your side.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Princess nodded, and accepted her fate.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Noticing  that one of her senshi had lingered, Serenity slowly approached the  leader of her guard. The Venusian wrung her fingers against the waist  of her orange dress. She would not meet her Princess’ gaze.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mina-chan, shouldn’t you be with the others? I thought the four of  you were going to develop a plan for your next mission.” Serenity’s  voice was soft and coaxing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, I’ll join them soon.” Plans had  already started to form in the Venusian’s mind, but they could wait for  the moment. Minako stepped closer to her Princess. “I… hope you don’t  mind, Serenity-chan, but, there is a question I’d like to ask.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serenity took Minako’s hands. “Anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Venusian’s shoulders stiffened and her hands where they were linked  with the Princess’ became quite interesting. “When we attacked the  scouting party on Jupiter’s pole, Rei ran out of arrows,” a lengthy  pause ensued and Serenity did not press the matter. Minako finally met  her Princess’ gaze with darkened eyes, “but she saved me with an arrow  born of-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shh.” The Princess of the Moon pressed a finger to her  senshi’s lips and when Minako looked to her in question, her sweet  smile somehow set the other woman at ease.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s supposed to be this way, Mina-chan.” She smiled sagely. “Now, your friends are waiting for you.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
In  the senshi’s private courtyard that served as an antechamber to their  private rooms, the Mercurian woman sat hunched over a transparent  screen, small fingers nimbly tapping away at the translucent keyboard.  It was not the Martian’s way to look over one’s shoulder, but the  technology caught her attention.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you researching the youma, Ami-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blunette didn’t  so much as look back to the Priestess and her fingers never missed a  beat. “No. Something unrelated, but just as interesting. A phenomenon  that I’ve been tracking over the past several years.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto  sidled towards the smaller woman and laid a hand on the shoulder the  Martian wasn’t standing over. “Sunspot activity again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Un.” Ami  said, and finally turned her attention to Rei. “The solar maximum was  five years ago, so we should be in a period of solar minimum. But… the  sun has been showing an unprecedented amount of activity in the past  three years.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Three years?” Rei asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes. Solar flares  and sunspots have grown increasingly more common and more and more  intense. I fear that if it continues at this rate, the whole solar  system could be affected. Temperature increases, droughts, crop  failures, the cascading effect could prove most worrisome.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is all hypothetical though.” Rei said, rather than asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then stop worrying, Ami-chan.” Makoto said, ruffling the other woman’s bangs messily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Never the less, as distracted hands smoothed her blue hair back down, the Mercurian squinted uneasily at the data before her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Suddenly,  the door swung on its hinges, and that loud disruption heralded Venus  Minako. The golden haired woman marched forward, the heels of her shoes  muffled by the thick, ornate rug beneath her feet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei, you’re coming with me.” She barked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Priestess frowned. “Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re going to Mercury.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  would be the logical step for the next mission.” Ami said. She turned  back to her computer, minimized the window she was analyzing, opened a  new one, and began inputting data immediately. “I will stay behind. By  supporting your mission via the Moon’s Eternity Main System, I can  analyze and theorize much quicker from here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll accompany you two.” Makoto said gruffly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. You’ll stay here and guard the Princess. We already decided to up her security detail.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Jovian’s hazel eyes hardened. “But, for only two senshi to… “ She  caught herself. Rei was a formidable warrior, and it was easy to forget  she wasn’t one of them. “I mean, the two of you shouldn’t go to a pole  full of youma alone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minako and I are up to this task.  Besides,” she said causally, ”I’m the only one that can sense them and  track their locations.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s quiet words seemed to strengthen  Minako, and the Venusian stood taller, a small amount of softness in  her eyes tempering her commanding tone. “We’ve done it before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Jovian’s shoulders slumped. ”Fine, but that means the both of you have  to agree to two conditions.” Minako raised an interested brow and  Makoto continued in a serious tone. “First, you have to agree that  you’ll not go <em>looking</em> for trouble. No fighting the youma if you can avoid it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And second?” Minako asked her tall subordinate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No fighting with each <em>other</em>, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei and Minako looked to each other. Eyebrows rose. Amused snorts fired off at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll try to behave ourselves.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Ruffling  the expansive canopy of the tall oak tree, a slight breeze blew across  the Sea of Serenity, and Minako was unsurprised to find Rei sitting  under the bough of the tree she had found her near days before.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I don’t know if </em>I<em> could have gotten her out of that dress faster.’ </em>She considered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  leader of the senshi was momentarily caught off guard at the intensity  of the thought. She shrugged it off. She had only meant to express the  Martian’s dislike for formal wear. <em>‘She </em>does<em> look quite handsome in that getup, though.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For as much as you stare at that sea, one would think you’d want to go swimming.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  could have been bait, but Rei chose not to bite, and continued to  marvel at the ocean as the sun trekked across the rim of the mountains  that bordered that body of water. “We have nothing like it on Mars.  I’ve never seen anything so breathtaking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian titled  her head, surprised that the Martian would be so candid. A distant  smile touched her lips. Was she starting to open up to her?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  finally turned to the presence she’d sensed before Minako’s words had  heralded her appearance, and she quickly found herself questioning the  validity of her last statement.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For she very much <em>had</em> lost her breath.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Venusian had also shed her formal wear for more casual Lunarian fare.  In direct contrast to the Martian’s neatly tailored trousers and fitted  shirt, Minako sported a short skirt and gauzy blouse and the sides of  her long, blonde hair were pinned up into a half ponytail.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  smiled softly. Empathic as she could be, she basked in the reaction  she’d hoped for. “Why don’t we get a closer look?” She offered quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At what, exactly?” The slightest on inflections laced Rei’s voice and the two women stared at each other for a long moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  golden warrior straddled the fine line for a tense moment, and then  smiled widely. “At the sea, of course!” She exclaimed. “Or more  precisely, Montes Haemus,” she pointed to the foot of the mountain  range that began where the Moon Palace ended. The lights of the city  nestled at the water’s edge beckoned brightly. “Only the best seaside  shopping this side of Venus.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei frowned. “Shouldn’t we be preparing for our mission? I thought Ami-san was going to brief you on-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop  being so boring!” Minako cried. “ Besides, I’m the leader, and I say  we’re going shopping. You might like it here more than you think. Let  me show you around a little.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian looked to the hand offered before her. Her eyes narrowed. She suspected a trap. “What is this, a date?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako smirked and forcibly took Rei’s hand, pulling the slightly taller woman to her feet. “If that’s what makes <em>you</em> happy.” She said dismissively.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  effect of ‘night’, she’d been told, was a product of the Moon’s  supercomputer, the Eternity Main System. It could create pockets of  atmosphere and weather, and even replicate nightfall, which was a  phenomenon not seen on their side of the Moon, as it was stuck in  synchronous orbit with the Earth. Rei found she quite liked the effect,  for she had missed the night since arriving on the Moon; the thick  curtains in the room she’d been given did little to mask the fact that  the sun was out and shining at all times.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Paper lanterns lined the narrow cobblestone streets that wound  along the foothills of Montes Haemus. The streets were wide enough only  for foot traffic and a small collection of mismatched tables and chairs  that bordered the sidewalk cafes. At one of those tables, Rei and  Minako sat comfortably.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Several shopping bags were gathered at  the Priestess’ feet, clothes and accessories nearly spilling from each  one. Most of it belonged to the Venusian, but an outfit or two belonged  to the Martian, who had been desperate for any excuse to keep the  clingy leader of the senshi out of her dressing room while she changed  into outfit after outfit pushed upon her by said woman – even if it  meant purchasing clothes she’d likely never wear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako leaned  across the table, supporting herself on an elbow while she spun her  crimson wine around the edge of a wide glass lazily. A wide smile  slowly captured her lips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve drank two more than you.” She declared.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei smirked at the singsong quality of the Venusian’s voice. “Last time I checked, this wasn’t a competition.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako snorted. “You’ve gone soft.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Priestess stood suddenly and collected the bags at her feet. “Back to  the palace with you. You’ve reached your limit, and we have a mission  in the morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian blew a raspberry in the Martian’s general direction. “You’re no fun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve  never claimed to be.” Rei said simply as she shifted their bags to one  hand and wrapped an arm around Minako’s waist to pull the other woman  to her feet. As expected, the Venusian leaned into Rei’s form eagerly,  and the Priestess led them down the busy street, unsurprised when  Minako began to fully take advantage of the situation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  stiffened. The golden warrior’s hands had always had a propensity to  wander, but this was a bit much. There were everywhere – around her  waist, along her ribcage, pressed against the small of her back,  resting on her hip in the bare spot at her midriff between her shirt  and the low waist of her trousers… the Priestess shuddered. And why  couldn’t she help but notice that the slightly smaller blonde fit  against her side so comfortably?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“People are <em>watching</em>.” She finally hissed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  sucked her teeth noisily. “Let them.” She met Rei’s amethyst eyes with  no small amount of amusement. “Unless you could honestly say that <em>you</em> wouldn’t appreciate two beautiful women walking down the street arm in arm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei snorted and looked away. Minako won.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Besides,<em> I</em> think you like it.” Minako said smugly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or maybe I just don’t have a free hand to ward off your drunken advances.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian chuckled. “Aren’t we doing this all backwards?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t the sober one supposed to take advantage of the drunken one?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I hate to break this to you, Minako, but it’s not seduction if you tell the other party what you’re doing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Guided  by the dim streetlights and the pinpoint brightness of the fabricated  stars above, their laughter mingled as the two women left the city  proper and reentered the Moon Palace. Both women blinked, disoriented,  as they left the confines of the town’s false night, and the brightness  of full day on the moon caused them both to stumble slightly. However,  despite the appearance of mid afternoon, the hour was late, and most  Lunarians would be fast asleep.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Quiet now,” Rei warned gently, “or you’ll wake the entire Palace.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Indeed,  Minako’s alcohol induced laughter had tapered off, and the woman’s  tiring form relied more and more on Rei’s strength to see her to her to  her room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian dropped the handful of bags at the  Venusian’s door in order to be able to turn the knob, and with some  amount of effort, she pushed the bags inside the door with a foot,  pulled the woman in her arms out of the hallway, and then managed to  shut the door behind her with her foot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The golden-blue glow  provided by the Sun and the Earth where it streamed through a small  crack in the heavy curtains that shielded the window was ample light to  see by, and Rei guided Minako across the large room to an expansive  bed. With one arm, she held the Venusian to her chest as she pulled  sharply on the soft comforter and the sheet below. When she began to  gently lower the blonde to the bed, deceptively strong arms tightened  around her neck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Its okay, I’m just-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s breath hitched  in her throat when warm, wet lips kissed her on the cheek. Then on her  jaw line. Then on the tender skin of her neck, where Minako’s lips  lingered temptingly long.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei ducked out of Minako’s embrace and  stood straight. A hand was quick to dart out and grab her wrist before  the Martian could pull away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stay with me tonight.” Minako nearly pleaded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.” Rei said quietly. “Not when you’re drunk.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When I’m sober then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian smiled slightly. She leaned down and planted a feather light kiss on Minako’s forehead. “Goodnight, <em>Princess</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  forced herself to retreat to the door. The small sliver of silver light  from the hallway illuminated her gentle features and pale complexion.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei?”</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I like it when you call me that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei smiled, and shut the door behind her.</span></p>

Author’s Notes:
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I freely admit that Minako’s 'Call me Princess' line is influenced  by PGSM. Wouldn’t it be great to hear Ayaka’s Minako/Venus say that to  Keiko’s Rei/Mars? Quite honestly, as much as I enjoyed working with the  manga/anime inspired versions of the Sailor Moon characters in this  fic, I wish I could have used the PGSM characters. But… I think it just  may turn out better this way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ah, and more plot is introduced!  Sunspot activity may be threatening the solar system. Talks with the  Earth will start soon, the youma invasion doesn’t seem to be lessening.  What does it all mean?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Preview, Chapter 6: On Mercury: What You Wanted</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Of all things to do, Venus laughed. “If we make it out of this I’m going to kill you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei snorted. “<em>Now</em> what did I do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That stunt you pulled back there that earned you that wound.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  wound is nothing, it’s just a scrape. Look, I’m fine! I’m barely even  bleeding.” The Martian sliced the air before her, effortlessly twirling  her sword in wide arcs to prove her point.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The golden warrior was unimpressed. “I’m warning you, Rei, don’t you <em>ever</em> sacrifice yourself for me again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sacrifice?” Rei cried. “What are you talking about? You claim to be this great diplomat, but you know <em>nothing</em> of Martian behaviors-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The youma took that as their cue and as one, their lumbering forms charged the two women.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  as the wall of monsters approached, the Martian dropped to her knees in  a boneless heap. Her hand came to rest above her heart. Her breath all  but froze in her lungs. Her vision turned red. <em>‘What is this?’</em> Her eyes focused on the golden warrior – standing, she was an easier  target, and as fierce claws reached for Venus’ slender form, Rei felt  the power she’d experienced on Jupiter surge to life within her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She didn’t hesitate. She embraced it fully. Rei screamed. She felt like she was on fire.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In reality, she was.</span></p>
