----------------------------------------------------------------------

Serenity dashed outside, Moon Stick in her hand, two cats at her heels, 
stopping dead still at the sight that met her eyes.  Young Serenity 
screamed as Queen Beryl&#39;s sword pierced Endymion, and the young prince 
fell at her feet.  Tears streaming down her cheeks, young Serenity 
picked up her lover&#39;s sword and fell on it.  &quot;No!&quot; the queen screamed.  
&quot;Serenity!&quot;  But her daughter was dead, and with it all her hopes and 
dreams.
 
&quot;I won&#39;t let it end like this,&quot; Serenity vowed.  She heard Luna and 
Artemis&#39;s objections, but no words could reach her now.  Summoning the 
powerful ginzuishou to her hand, Serenity placed it on the Moon Stick 
and raised the weapon above her head.  Eyes full of tears, the queen 
released the full power of the crystal, watching as the invaders from 
the Dark Kingdom vanished, feeling her life energy disappearing.  The 
pink light from her crystal enveloped her daughter and the man who had 
given his life to protect that woman, and the light reached farther, 
absorbing the bodies of the dead Senshi.
 
Mars and Venus, hands reaching for each other but unable to touch, were 
absorbed by the pink light, each surrounded by her own personal bubble, 
as the princess and the Earth prince had been.  Jupiter, one hand 
resting on Mercury&#39;s, vanished into a bubble, Mercury an instant behind 
her.  Setsuna watched the light come, and she raised her staff, 
whispering an order to the Space Sword and the Aqua Mirror.  Both glowed 
briefly to free themselves of the blood sullying their surfaces and 
vanished, entering their Senshi&#39;s Pure Heart Crystals, ready to remain 
dormant until they were needed again.  The Garnet Orb glowed sadly at 
the loss of its partners.  The pink light reached the lovers, hands 
linked, and reluctantly separated them into individual bubbles.  One 
final bubble floated in from Dosei, containing the little girl who would 
have been Sailor Saturn.
 
The Senshi&#39;s bubbles floated over the Moon Palace, flying off to Earth 
and the future with the other children of the Silver Millennium as the 
Mystical Silver Crystal entered its princess to wait patiently for her 
rebirth.  Inside their bubbles, the Senshi were healed, and their 
spirits were ready to be reborn on Earth in the future.  The bubbles 
were followed by two capsules containing the two cat advisors, sending 
them forward, too, so that they could guide the princess and her Senshi 
in the future.
 
That left only two people on the Moon.
 
Pluto knelt by Serenity&#39;s side, tears streaming down her cheeks.  &quot;You 
used the full power of the crystal.&quot;
 
&quot;I had to, Setsu-chan.  I could not let my daughter die like that.  And 
now they will be reborn on Earth, where Serenity and Endymion can be 
together, and even Haruka and Michiru will not be kept apart.  Will you 
watch over her for me?&quot;
 
Setsuna nodded as the queen, having spent all of her energy sealing the 
evil away and saving the Senshi, took a final shallow breath.  &quot;I love 
you, Setsuna,&quot; she breathed as the last of her life fled her body.  She 
had never said the words before.
 
Setsuna let her tears fall as she leaned down and kissed Serenity&#39;s 
still lips.  &quot;I love you, too.&quot;  Her farewells finished, Setsuna stood 
up and wrapped her hands around her staff.  She was alone.  Sighing, she 
returned to the Gate of Time, thinking about Michiru&#39;s child growing in 
her womb.  Her last words echoed in the silence.  &quot;Every end brings a 
new beginning.  I won&#39;t lose hope.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Michiru woke with a start as Haruka&#39;s scream filled the house.  Shocked, 
she looked up into her lover&#39;s haunted emerald eyes, gasping as memories 
flooded her mind.  Setsuna, hair slightly disheveled, dashed into their 
bedroom, Hotaru just behind her.  Haruka finally managed to catch her 
breath, and she slipped out of bed, stopping beside the window and 
panting slightly.  Her partner followed her, leaning her aqua-haired 
head on Haruka&#39;s shoulder.
 
&quot;What?&quot;
 
&quot;Our past, Setsuna-san,&quot; Haruka whispered, eyes closed.  &quot;I just 
remembered everything.  It was this huge burst of information, and I . . 
.&quot;
 
&quot;It was a lot,&quot; Michiru finished.  Remembering her last encounter with 
Sailor Pluto, Michiru spun to face the green-haired woman.  
&quot;Setsuna-san!  I remember now.  I gave Helios to you!  That&#39;s how he 
ended up on Earth!&quot;  Setsuna nodded, remembering the boy she birthed.  
&quot;Thank you.&quot;
 
&quot;Any time.&quot;  Setsuna gently pushed Hotaru out the door, knowing that the 
two women needed to be alone.  &quot;I&#39;ll see you in the morning, then.  Good 
night.&quot;
 
Haruka turned to Michiru after the rest of their family left, a smile 
spreading across her lips.  &quot;I told you to run.&quot;
 
&quot;I had to stay with you, Haruka.&quot;  Michiru let Haruka wrap her arms 
around her waist, pulling her close.  &quot;I can&#39;t live without you.&quot;
 
Haruka leaned down and kissed Michiru, tears drying on her cheeks.  
&quot;Aishiteru, Michi.&quot;
 
Michiru laughed as Haruka pushed her to their bed, kissing the taller 
woman as the blonde landed on top of her.  &quot;Aishiteru, Ruka.  Besides, 
everything turned out for the best.&quot;
 
&quot;It did.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
On the top of a hill in Tokyo, a young priestess awoke, heart pounding 
fiercely.  The image of Sailor Venus, reaching desperately for her, 
brought tears to Rei&#39;s eyes, and she sat for a moment to clear her mind 
and calm her heart.  &quot;Minako,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;I had no idea.&quot;  Knowing 
that she would never get back to sleep, Rei headed outside and sat on 
the top of the stairs leading away from her shrine.  She watched, a 
smile spreading across her face, as the dawn brought a golden-haired 
beauty to Hikawa Shrine.  She had not been the only one to remember her 
past.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Makoto awoke to a pounding on her door from a sleep her body had 
reluctantly returned to after memories of her past life filled her 
dreams.  She was met by a blue-haired girl she knew very well, and Ami 
let Makoto pull her into her arms.  Some memories were best shared.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Setsuna smiled as she closed her eyes.  Every ending brought a new 
beginning.
