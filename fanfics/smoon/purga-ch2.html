----------------------------------------------------------------------

My return to the land of the living took a lot of sheer willpower.
Since I hadn&#39;t much moved for an entire week, for a while I walked
clumsily through my apartment hallways like a drunkard. The first thing
I did was get myself a glass of water, and I swear I nearly dropped the
full glass on my foot before I managed to drink half of it. It helped
though. The cold water cleared my mind a little, and by the time I had
gone to take a shower, my motor skills were returned to me.

The shower was refreshing in more ways than one. Not only was I rinsing
my skin, I was also, in a sense, rinsing away some of the lethargy that
had bound me for the past week. It&#39;s amazing how simple human acts can
sometimes bring focus back into a person&#39;s life. Small things that most
people never think about. Like breathing. I knew things were going to
be difficult for me for a while longer yet, but I wasn&#39;t letting it
beat me. I&#39;d live around it as best I could, and fight it as hard as I
could if it came at a time I wasn&#39;t ready for it. I felt empowered by
my decision. I was once again in control.

After finishing up in the shower, I changed into a pair of navy blue
cargo pants and a black muscle-t. Although I was feeling better, I
still believed it was too early for me to be going out just yet, so I
had no reason to get dressed into anything fancy. And even if I was
feeling up to leaving, there was no way I&#39;d have time to today. My
apartment was in complete disarray, and the small red counter on my
answering machine informed me that I had had fifty-two phone calls
during my special &#39;nap time&#39;, all or most of which I would have to
reply to as soon as possible.

&quot;Welcome back, Makoto.&quot; I breathed out a heavy sigh. &quot;The world has
been turning since you&#39;ve been gone.&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I couldn&#39;t believe the disaster zone my apartment had become. I mean, I
had glanced over it when I&#39;d gotten my glass of water, so I knew it
needed some work, but damn, I had no idea it was this much! I remember
getting up on a few occasions during the past few days to eat and so
on, but that didn&#39;t account for all of the clothes strewn all down my
hallway and living room floor, or the mountain of dishes and deformed
food remains in my kitchen.

Actually, when I really thought about it, I couldn&#39;t remember getting
up to eat more than once. That&#39;s the only time I remember getting up at
all. But I must have....I wasn&#39;t in the same clothes I&#39;d been wearing
when it all began. And I could swear my pillowcases had been changed
too. So I must have been at least partially functional at some point,
whether I could remember it or not. Now it was time to see just exactly
how functional I&#39;d been.

From the look of it, somewhere in my stupored state, I&#39;d attempted to
make a cake. Why I put a chicken in the middle of it, I really don&#39;t
know. I&#39;d also made some muffins, they were still sitting the their
tins happy as can be. They actually looked appetizing and I was going
to snack on a few, until I saw the anchovy fin poking out of the top of
one. Shaking my head, I grabbed a garbage bag and started dumping all
of my lovely &#39;creations&#39; into it. In a way, I guess it was good this
happened. I now know what I&#39;d do if I ever became an alcoholic. I&#39;d
molest everything in the kitchen and create hospital food.

With that in mind, I vowed to myself I&#39;d never become a heavy drinker.

When I finally cleared the counter and fridge of my culinary
atrocities, it was time to tackle the dishes. Usually I don&#39;t mind
doing them, but some of these had been sitting out so long I swear the
food particles must have fused with the porcelain plates. Needless to
say, by the time I did finish the Magic Mountain, I never wanted to see
another dish again. I was actually happy to move on to my laundry. At
least all I had to do with that was gather it up in armfuls and shove
it into a machine.

And that&#39;s just what I did. I hauled out my old reliable laundry
basket, and went through every room in my apartment, throwing
everything on the floor inside without a second glance. When I started
shoving it all into the machine, I didn&#39;t even bother to go through it
- who cares if whites wash with darks, if the water&#39;s cold no color
will run. All I had left to do now was water my poor plants, and then I
could sit down and start attending to my phone messages.

After all, one of the could be from Minako.

There were fifty-two messages. Surely just one of those could be from
her...couldn&#39;t it? True, she did kind of leave in a hurry when I showed
her Peeko, and she even looked a little angry....but...

She&#39;ll want to talk about it, won&#39;t she? Even if she doesn&#39;t want
anything to do with me anymore...she&#39;ll at least break it to me gently,
right? It would be cruel to do anything else, and Minako has never been
a cruel person...

Realization of the situation I was in with Minako now finally hit me
full force for the first time. Swallowing hard, I sank down onto the
couch, my arms wrapping around myself. I felt cold, and sick. The look
she had on her face the last night I saw her...it was a look I couldn&#39;t
recognize. I&#39;d never seen her look that way before. Everything I had
remembered...she already knew. Everything. And she&#39;d never spoken a
word of it to me, ever. Why would she do that? Maybe she had been
hoping I would never remember, so she didn&#39;t have to feel some sort of
obligation to me this time around.

But Minako has never been a cruel person...

I decided that this was a path I couldn&#39;t afford to let my mind take.
Fifty-two messages, there&#39;s a lot of room for a Minako call in there.
If it just happened that there wasn&#39;t a call from her anywhere in the
pile, then I could think about the possible reasons behind it. But in
the mean time, I had a bigger challenge to face...sorting through all
of those phone messages.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

It took me over an hour just to listen to all of the messages. I&#39;d kept
track of who called when in one of my notebooks, making sure to jot an
&#39;X&#39; down beside calls I should return before others. It was a crude
method of organization, but hey, I&#39;m not Ami. Whatever works is fine
with me.

About thirty of the calls I&#39;d received were from various restaurant
suppliers, all hoping to negotiate a contract with me. Although it was
nice to know that word was getting around about my future endeavor, it
was also a little disheartening at the same time. They didn&#39;t care a
thing about what kind of restaurant I was going to be running, or how
much it meant to me, all they wanted was to line their pockets. It&#39;s
something I should get used to, I suppose. For a lot of people, that&#39;s
all that matters. Making the mean green wherever you can, from whoever
you can. It&#39;s a fact of life. Business is business. Hell, soon enough I
would be running a business, doing the same thing, right?

In all my years of dreaming about owning my own restaurant, I had never
really considered the cold hearted business aspect of it. All I thought
about was how great it would be to share my God given gift with others,
to be working at doing something I love. Not many people get to work at
their dream job, after all. Never once did competing enter my mind, or
hiring employees, or, in some instances, firing them. Bill paying and
negotiations completely eluded my thought process. I never thought
beyond the fact that I wanted to cook.

Looking at all the numbers I had written down on my list, my heart
sank. I wondered if all of this preparation work would be worth it in
the end.

BEEP

I was jarred out of my thoughts by that loud, annoying sound that every
answering machine gives off to let you know all your messages have been
heard. I&#39;d gotten through forty-five of them before zoning out, and
none had been from Minako. Fighting down the urge to punch through my
living room wall, I took a deep breath and looked over the electronic
number list on my answering machine, to see if she&#39;d been one of the
messages I&#39;d missed while I was re-thinking destiny.

Her number wasn&#39;t listed.

Not there.

I&#39;d been practically off the face of the earth for a week, and she
hadn&#39;t even called.

Minako didn&#39;t call me.

Fifty-two messages....and none had been from her.

Feeling numb, I slowly got up to my feet. I couldn&#39;t stand to be in
this room right now, not the room she has walked out on me in. Not the
room that was witnessing my complete, utter heartbreak.

Not the room that knew she didn&#39;t call.

I slid on a pair of Nikes and tied the laces up with shaky hands. I
didn&#39;t have a lot of friends outside of the sailor senshi, but I did
have one I knew I needed tonight. She&#39;s the only one who&#39;d understand
the pain I was doing my best to stave off. She could help me figure out
what to do before I did something stupid. She could help me fix things
before they tore me apart. Clumsily I grabbed my keys, slid on my
jacket and helmet, and left my apartment.

There was no way I was staying in the room tonight. I was on my way to
see Stevie at Tiger Alley.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&#39;Hey, this is Makoto. You know the drill. Leave a message, and If I
like ya, I&#39;ll call back.&#39;

&#39;Mako-chan....how are you feeling? Last time I checked on you, you
seemed to be doing a lot better...your fever was down, and you weren&#39;t
talking in your sleep anymore. I&#39;ll take that as a good sign. You
should probably be up again soon, if this is running its course with
you like it did with me. As you&#39;ve probably guessed...we have a lot to
talk about. When you get this message...give me a call, ok? Take care.&#39;
