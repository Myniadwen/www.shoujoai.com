<h2>Shadows of the Past</h2>
<p>In the shrine on Cherry Blossom Hill, the Dragon  mandala suddenly ignited into crimson as a portal opened in its center. Two  figures emerged from the sun-bright hole in the air and resolved themselves  into a pair of feminine forms. The taller of the two looked around and nodded.  “Good we have arrived correctly. Now we must hurry! There is no more time!”<p>
  She raised the long golden key shaped staff in her  hand and cried “Sailor Teleport!”<p>
  The two figures faded from view.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Akane’s scream ripped through the evening and drew  everyone running to jam in the door to her room. Akane was curled up on the bed  crying piteously, projecting an aura of pure despair.<p>
  “Akane?” Ranma asked with more concern than anyone had  ever heard in his voice. “What’s wrong?” <p>
  She looked up, her face a mask of misery. “Zhu Shu!  She was in a fight…  Oh gods, Ranma… She’s  dead!”<p>
  Ranma hit his knees as a collective gasp arose. Shan  Pu came stumbling out of Zhu Shu’s room partially dressed and with a look of  murder in her eyes.  She pushed through  the crowd to meet Akane’s tearful gaze. “Shan Pu feel.  Tell who did. Shan Pu kill.”<p>
  Akane nodded, her tears giving way to a look of pure  rage. “I’m coming with you.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>In a house by a shrine in Nikomi, a vase shattered as  it fell from Belldandy’s nerveless fingers and a rain began to fall on Tokyo.<p>
  Urd and Skuld rushed into the kitchen, concern an  uncommon expression on Urd’s face while Skuld was crying unabashedly as she ran  to hug Belldandy tightly.  Belldandy  stroked her hair as she cried as well, listening to the sounds of a god  mourning the loss of a mortal child…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>In the heavens, Kami-Sama stepped down from his  throne, a tear crawling down his face from his single blue eye at the sound  that rang through the myriad of worlds in his care. He placed his hand on the  arm of his throne and bowed his head.<p>
  “Soon, old friend. It is almost over. Soon you will  need grieve for your children no more…”</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>In her lair, Mara had watched the battle in her  scrying mirror. As Zhu Shu fell, she had laughed at the irony of it all… To  have gone through so much trouble in China only to have this happen?!!<p>
  Her laughter was cut short as her ears picked up a  sound that cut through the black haze that had filled her mind of late and  drained away the rage that had fed it.  <p>
  The Dragon was mourning the loss of his child…<p>
  She slowly sank to her knees, her eyes locked on the  still form in her mirror as the realization sank in and despair drove the  madness from her mind. <p>
  “By Hild… What have I done?”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>In a pagoda in China, an old, old man knelt in  front of an altar shaped in the form of an Imperial Dragon. Around him, the  Dragon mandala slowly faded from crimson to blue. Tears ran from his eyes as he  knelt. Even here, locked away in the shrine, he gave no other outward sign of  his grief; anymore than he had the day his granddaughter had left his  protection to seek her destiny, or the day he had found her body broken and  cold at the base of a cliff. An ancient woman and a young girl had found him  there, holding her silent form, and they had given her back to him… along with  a warning.<p>
  It had not made it hurt any less the second time…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Nabiki watched as her sister and her two fiancées  disappeared into the rain. It was a truly mind numbing event to find she was so  upset over what Akane had said had happened. Kasumi was in the kitchen making  tea in a daze, her dad and Mr. Saotome were in the dining room getting drunk,  and here she was staring off after the fighters and wishing, for the first time  since she had convinced her dad to stop dragging her into the dojo and trying  to teach her to fight, that she had continued the lessons…<p>
  And she had certainly never expected to feel like she  had just lost a sister.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Zhu Shu opened her eyes to the soft fluttering of  petals against her cheek. She was surprised to find herself in a grove of  cherry trees. She remembered thinking that she was dying, but now the pain was  gone, and she was here.<p>
  Wherever <em>here</em> was. <p>
  She stood and looked around. In every direction stood  cherry trees, all in bloom. A soft breeze was stirring the branches and the  fall of petals was as thick as snow. Overhead was a night sky, fading into a  softly lit horizon in all directions, like the last moments of a setting sun…<p>
  She turned, her ears catching a sound other than the  wind in the trees and found a faint path leading between the trees towards what  looked to be a small clearing. Slowly she walked towards the brighter light. As  she approached, the sounds resolved themselves into a cheerful humming of the  song her mother had once sung to her.<p>
  She stepped out into the clearing to find a large  stone covered with the Dragon mandala. Beyond it stood an arch of stone.  Setting in front of the arch, blocking it completely was a stone bench. Sitting  on the bench was… <p>
  “Ying-Ying?” she asked in amazement, her eyes  blinking.<p>
  The pink haired beauty looked up. “Ni hao, my love.  I’d say nice to see you again, but not here…” She looked around. “If I had my  way, we’d never meet <em>here</em> again.”  She sighed.<p>
  “Where is this place?” Zhu Shu asked, puzzled.<p>
  Ying-Ying grimaced. “Death’s door.”<p>
  Zhu Shu started. “I’m dead then…” Zhu Shu looked down  at herself. “I feel fine.”<p>
  Ying-Ying smiled. “Of course you do, love. This place  is a place of souls.”<p>
  Zhu Shu turned wide eyes to her. “Have you come to  meet me?” <p>
  Ying-Ying laughed, her bright voice tinkling. “Oh,  Beloved… It’s really too bad I can’t let you remember meeting me in this place  anymore than last time. That’s exactly the same thing you asked the last time  you were here. My answer is still the same. This is where I have <em>always</em> been. This is where the Dragon  has made a place for me. This is my destiny.”<p>
  “Your destiny?”<p>
  “Yes, love. The destiny I <em>chose</em> so that I could always remain with you even though we could  meet only in dreams. I am your Guardian. I bar the door.”<p>
  “I don’t understand.” Zhu Shu said uncertainly.<p>
  “Yes, you do, beloved. You just don’t want to. I could  not bear a life apart from you, it was just too painful to feel both my own loss  and your loneliness. I-I took my life to escape from that pain, yet as I left  the mortal world behind, I faced the Dragon. He gave me a choice. I could go to  the spirit realm, and you would join me there soon, or I could wait here, at  the boundary of your life and death and bar <em>your</em> way.” She smiled as she gestured around. “It was an easy choice to make. Here,  I can be with you, watch as you live your life, watch as you find your loves,  and as time passes and your grief fades, I can come to you in dreams.”  Ying-Ying smiled softly. “I am forever with you, my love.”<p>
  Zhu Shu sat down on the bench beside her. “I wish you  could be with me in life.”<p>
  “But I am, love. I am always here, you just have not  found the way to visit me yet, because you have not searched for me. Nor were  you ready to. You have traveled far in your quest, both physically and  spiritually. Soon, you will find the path to me… Then, you will know I am  always here.”<p>
  “You speak as if I am to leave.”<p>
  “You soon shall. I told you. I bar the door. So long  as I stand guard you cannot truly die. You still have a destiny to find in  life, as I found mine in death. You are on the path towards what you must  become, this is just a pause in the path, a place to rest. When last you were  here, I comforted you for my loss, and even though you remember it not, when  you were healed, your grief for me had begun to heal too. You will not remember  this either, but this too is a time of healing. I started it early when I came  to your dreams, but here, I can do much more.” She patted her lap. Zhu Shu  smiled as she turned and lay back to look up at Ying-Ying’s beautiful  face.  As Ying-Ying ran her fingers  through her hair, she closed her eyes.<p>
  “I love it when you stroke my hair.”<p>
  “I know. I love stroking it. It’s one of the things I  miss most. I really wish I could let you keep more than just impressions of our  meeting here, but I can at least comfort you with the fact that it will not  always be so. When you can find your own way to me, there will no longer be any  need.”<p>
  “But why must it be so?”<p>
  “Because, Zhu Shu, you have a destiny that you must  find on your own. I can guide you only so much. I don’t know all of your  future, Love, but I know too much. If I say too much, I may guide you towards  that future, or I may destroy all possibility of you ever achieving it. The  risk is too great at this point. As much as it saddens me, the only way to be  sure you are the one who makes your own choices is to cloud your memories of  these times.”<p>
  “Is my destiny so important, then?”<p>
  Ying-Ying smiled. “To the world? I cannot say. But to  those whose lives you touch, and to me, yes. You affect the lives of everyone  you meet Zhu Shu, and because of you, they grow, or they change, sometimes in  small ways, sometimes in large. You are a catalyst, an agent of change, and  your part in the lives of your friends is not yet over. But for everyone whose  life you touch, they touch you as well. You learn from them and care for them,  as the Dragon cares for you. You are the Dragon’s Child.”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked up at Ying-Ying. “I don’t understand.”<p>
  “You will, in time, beloved. For now, it is time to  sleep. When you awake, you will be with your friends once more… and in time,  you will remember this. But for now, sleep…”<p>
  Zhu Shu’s eyes drifted closed slowly as her breathing  grew quiet. Ying-Ying continued stroking her hair as she drifted deeper into  sleep. Finally, she asked the air “I didn’t tell her too much, did I?”<p>
  “No child. And as you said she will not remember  this,” a kind and gentle voice spoke from the air all around her.<p>
  “This is the only part of my choice I regret. The need  to make her forget. The loneliness she will continue to feel, not knowing I am  here.”<p>
  “Yet you know the necessity of it.”<p>
  Ying-Ying sighed. “Yes.”<p>
  “We can at least do what we can to make her task  easier. She has been burdened with emotions and learning not her own.  I will remove that burden and allow her to  assimilate the knowledge in time.” <p>
  Ying-Ying nodded. “It would help. I know Belldandy and  Urd meant well, but I fear they did not expect the exchange to be so hard for  her.  My Little Mouse feels far too much  like a leaf in a whirlwind.” <p>
  “Akane’s mind is far more chaotic. She had far less  trauma from it, and has gained much of Zhu Shu’s calm, where Zhu Shu has had  her calm taken, and cannot regain it fully.   If this continues, she will go mad, as it has only been her innate  nature that has contained the cancer of her soul.  Already, I sense the darkness within her has  grown.  “<p>
  Ying-Ying nodded.   “I know, Legend.  I wish I had been  able to conquer my own demons and not take my life.  I gave Chaos a path to her heart with my  weakness.”<p>
  “Had you not, you would not have been able to save her  now.  Destiny would have come by a  different path, and found you unprepared.”<p>
  “Is the future so certain then?”<p>
  “No future is <em>certain,</em> child.” another voice added.  “Least of  all, hers.”<p>
  Ying-Ying looked up to see a kindly face, one  belonging to a smiling man with an intense blue eye and a patch.  He looked down at the sleeping girl in  Ying-Ying’s lap.  <p>
  Ying-Ying bowed, careful not to disturb Zhu Shu.  “I should not question, All-Father.” she  apologized.<p>
  Kami-Sama reached out to brush a stray hair from  Ying-Ying’s face.  “It is natural to  question, child.  Even more so when it is  for the welfare of one you love.”<p>
  Ying-Ying assayed a small smile.  “Yes, All-Father.  I just wish I was not so powerless to help  her.”<p>
  “It will not always be so, Ying-Ying.” Legend’s voice  answered.  “She will heal eventually, and  with healing will come the understanding to find her way back to you.”<p>
  “I wish I could tell her more.”<p>
  “In time child.” Kami-Sama said.  “We have worked too long and too hard to  thwart Chaos to risk exposing our hand to the enemy.  What we have prepared for has been set in  motion.  The Norn of the Past’s task has  been given, the Dragon’s Child brought out of hiding, the Shadow Lord has made  his presence known.   The signs that we  have traveled the right road are occurring.   The scales <em>will</em> be balanced.”<p>
  Ying-Ying bowed in acknowledgement.  “She misses me so much, Lord.  It has been <em>so</em> hard for her.”<p>
  “This too shall be redressed” Legend responded.  “If we remain strong, all will be well.” <p>
  “It is time…” Kami-Sama said gently.  “They have arrived.”<p>
  Ying-Ying nodded and traced the curve of Zhu Shu’s face  one final time as she faded from view.<p>
  “I just wish it wasn’t so hard to wait…”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“Truly a tragic loss of one so brave.” Tuxedo Kamen  said quietly, allowing Sailor Moon to sob against his chest, her tears lost  amid the falling rain.<p>
  Rei sat numbly staring, Zhu Shu’s hand still clutched  in hers while around her, the other Senshi huddled on their knees, crying.<p>
  Then a soft golden light surrounded them and a kindly  voice spoke. “Your grief does you credit, Senshi, but you mourn too soon.”<p>
  All eyes but Rei’s turned to look at the figures  outlined in the golden glow as they stepped out of the light.<p>
  An ancient woman with ankle length hair walked towards  the still and bloody figure. Faint hints of green could still be seen in the  sable mass, and her robe was trimmed in red and black. Her face was smooth, but  her skin was as thin as parchment, and the hand that gripped her long golden  staff was almost pure bone. Eons lived within her eyes.<p>
  Beside her walked a girl of about thirteen, dressed in  a Sailor suit with spiky shoulders and a purple fuku. She carried a glaive with  a double blade somewhat reminiscent of a can opener and the shadows of a  thousand sorrows haunted her eyes.<p>
  They stopped by Zhu Shu’s body, untouched by the rain,  and the elder reached down to place a hand on Rei’s shoulder. “Rise, Soul of  Fire. Do not mourn for the Dragon.”<p>
  Rei turned her tear streaked face, her eyes a frozen  wasteland, and stared without seeing the figure in front of her. “She is gone…”  she whispered. <p>
  “No, child. The Dragon but sleeps.” The old woman  reached down and with surprising strength, drew Rei to her feet. “Watch, and  grieve no more.”  She turned to the young  girl. “Hotaru.”<p>
  The girl nodded and raised her hands as energy coursed  through her body and into the still form on the ground. Zhu Shu rose slowly  into the air as her broken form began to knit itself back together. <p>
  The Senshi stared in shock as blood flowed back into  the slowly spinning figure and a halo of energy grew brighter and brighter. Her  body seemed to fade into transparency as her clothes burned away in the flow.  Only the dragon tattoo on her back remained visible, seeming to acquire a  strange three dimensionality as she spun. <p>
  Then streamers of energy spun around her transparent  form and a vision of her reformed, and yet, it was not. A tiara graced her  forehead, carved into the silhouette of a dragon clutching the ruby at her  brow. From her ears dangled paired yin yang symbols, while she was dressed in a  variant of a Sailor suit that was distinctly Mandarin, her scarlet fuku trimmed  in gold. In her hands, she held her swords, long scarlet streamers trailing  from them, but the dragons burned with a white light on their blades. Her feet  bore elegant scarlet slippers with small gold ribbons and she was surrounded by  a corona of golden flame.<p>
  The vision hung there for seconds only as the Senshi  gasped, then faded along with the energy pouring from the other girl. Zhu Shu  hung in the air before them, sheathed in her plain blue Mandarin dress. As her  spin came to a halt, she suddenly took a deep shuddering breath and slowly  descended to the ground. When her feet touched, her eyes opened and locked on  to the face of the old woman supporting a near fainting Rei. “You???”<p>
  The old woman nodded. “Once more we meet outside of  dreams, for the second time.” She let Rei go as the other girl stepped beside  her. She smiled as she looked at Zhu Shu. “Three times must we meet, while the  Dragon sleeps. Three times I will call, in answer to your fall. Three times  must you face, the price of defying fate. Three times must I mourn, ere the  Dragon stands reborn.” She stepped back into the light. “Farewell, my Little  Mouse with the eyes of a Dragon. We will meet again, for the last time and the  first time. Until then…” In a fall of golden light, they were gone. <p>
  For a moment, all was silent, then like a meteor  striking a planet, Rei crashed into Zhu Shu’s embrace.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The other Senshi were still standing frozen, too  stunned yet to move, when a sound like a bomb dropping came from overhead and  an explosion sent Sailor Moon flying as the roof under her disintegrated.  A battle cry of “Shan Pu kill!” echoed across  the battlefield as the purple haired Amazon launched herself at another Senshi,  her violet aura turning the falling rain into steam.<p>
  “Shan Pu!  NO!”<p>
  The voice stopped the rampaging Amazon dead in her  tracks, her bon buri a fraction of an inch from Sailor Mercury’s face.  Her eyes turned slowly to the direction the  sound had come from, her aura wavering, then flickering out.  For a second she blinked, then there was a  surprised meow as she vanished into the rubble, her bon buri clattering to the  ruined roof.<p>
  The Senshi blinked, wondering what had just happened,  then Akane dropped down to the battlefield as well. <p>
  “How could you let her get killed!” she yelled through  her tears.  “You were her…” her voice  trailed off as she realized who was standing in Rei’s embrace. <p>
  “Zhu Shu…” she whispered, not daring to believe her  eyes, but the miracle didn’t disappear and with the passing of her rage, she  could once again feel that the missing part of her mind had returned. She stood  stunned for the space of too many heartbeats as Rei stepped out from in front  of the blonde dragon girl, then with a flicker and a sonic boom, she was  twirling Zhu Shu in an embrace. <p>
  “<em>YOU’RE  ALIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</em>”<p>
  “Yes. Zhu Shu alive! Careful! No want Akane to break!”<p>
  A muttering and slightly steamy Shan Pu emerged from  the rubble with an umbrella and landed next to them.  She saw Akane hugging Zhu Shu and joined in  the embrace, holding them tightly. Then one by one, the other Senshi joined in  the group hug and happy noises arose. <p>
  Lost and forgotten, a pair of legs flailed wildly from  the pile of rubble which concealed their owner as muffled cries for help could  be heard. Tuxedo Kamen finally noticed them and the group broke up to go and  help him dig Sailor Moon out…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ranma dropped into the happy fray a few seconds later,  overjoyed as well at finding Zhu Shu alive, but the wet redhead warned them  that she had seen a few JSDF helicopters on the way. With a quick scurry, they  all darted for cover. <p>
  Thoroughly wet from the rain, the group found cover in  a nearby parking garage, most of the girls having to wring the water out of  their hair. Ranma for once was self conscious enough to not pull her shirt off  to wring it out, though he gave the only semi dry member of their group an evil  eye and muttered about how unfair it was that some people had umbrellas. Akane  finally released Zhu Shu long enough to ask “What happened?” <p>
  Zhu Shu gave her a sad smile.  “Senshi need help.  Attacks not affect creature.  Zhu Shu had use Final Attack to kill.”<p>
  Ranma stared.   “Zhu-chan, that was suicidal!   Final Strikes are fatal to all but the strongest of martial artists!”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   “Could not let friends die.”<p>
  Akane blinked. “Your accent’s back!”<p>
  “She was dead, like really messed up and blood  everywhere!” Sailor Moon said.<p>
  “She-she fell on some rubble… and- and she died  holding my hand.” Mars said quietly, still distressed over it all. “Then- then  an old woman came with a girl dressed like us and healed her.”<p>
  “Who kill? Shan Pu no see anyone else!” The Amazon  asked. <p>
  “There was this big creature, like a demon, and it was  controlling something else… a creature like living shadow.” Mercury said. “She  destroyed it.  She destroyed them both,  using her own energy and everything we could give her. She was absorbing  everything, even what the creature was throwing at her. Then she threw it all  back at it. She destroyed it utterly.”<p>
  Ranma stared. “What kind of school is that? I’ve never  studied anything like it. And I’ve never seen you use energy absorption  before.”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head.  “Shiva’s Dance dangerous.  Dance of Veils is only part of Dance.  Zhu Shu use Dance of Ashura.  Zhu Shu only spar with Ranma use Song School.  Sword dance. Shiva’s Dance use ribbon.  Zhu Shu leave swords in Tendo’s care.  Only have ribbon. Saw Senshi’s in danger.  Have to help.” The blonde dragon girl turned emerald green eyes to Akane. “Zhu  Shu <em>have</em> to help.” her voice pleaded  for understanding. <p>
  Akane hugged her. “Yes. You did. I’m just glad that  you’re alive now.”<p>
  Shan Pu touched her shoulder.  “Is warrior’s duty risk all for village.” she  said, in a voice that showed she was proud of Zhu Shu.  “Zhu Shu have heart of Warrior.  No have other choice.”<p>
  Akane gave the Amazon an appraising look and  smiled.  Shan Pu smiled softly back at  her.  “Still, is glad sister alive too.”  she added. <p>
  Mercury was looking over her computer. “As far as I  can tell, Zhu-sensei is in perfect health, at least for this form.”<p>
  Sailor Moon was looking over her shoulder. “Hey! What  happen-Ulp!” She glared at Jupiter over the hand covering her mouth.<p>
  “Zhu Shu is fine. And we should thank this wonderful  citizen for helping us like she did. Don’t you agree, <em>Sailor Moon</em>?”<p>
  “Yes, indeed. We should definitely thank her. That  someone who doesn’t know us would lend a hand like that is very noble.” Venus  said.<p>
  “Don’t bother, Minako. I already know who you all  are.” Ranma said. “You think I could watch Zhu Shu train you five and not  recognize the way you all move? Or Usagi’s hair?”<p>
  “What’s wrong with my hair!?!” Usagi shouted as she  yanked Makoto’s hand away.<p>
  “Nothing, if you want to look like a meatball head.”<p>
  Usagi sniffed. “I’ll have you know Mamoru adores  them.” She stuck out her tongue. “So there!”<p>
  Ranma stuck out her tongue back. “Odango Atama!”<p>
  “Baka!”<p>
  “Scarecrow!”<p>
  “Femboy!”<p>
  Akane gave the two name callers a cool look. “And to  think, Japan  depends on her to save it from evil.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>After they got everything sorted out, and explained to  Shan Pu why she shouldn’t tell anyone that Zhu Shu’s students were the Senshi,  Zhu Shu elected to go back to the shrine with Rei for the night, needing a  quiet place to meditate and see what her brief encounter with death had done to  her. Akane, Shan Pu and Ranma  had all  pouted, but acceded to her request. Zhu Shu noticed that Akane and Ranma were  still giving Shan Pu a wide berth, but there was respect there as well. At least  it hadn’t gone all that badly, but she couldn’t go back just yet, not until she  had accustomed herself to the reversion she had undergone. It was very strange,  like there were things she could <em>almost</em> remember… so much that seemed just out of reach in a golden fog.<p>
  At least she didn’t feel like Akane’s emotions were  raging just under her consciousness, only barely contained. She felt like  herself again, and while her chi was still intertwined, and she was still  linked, she was <em>herself</em> again... fully and only herself. After the last  week, it was a definite relief... but it would take a few hours of peace for  her to recover her equilibrium after dying, though despite the fact she had  expended every last bit of her chi in the Final Attack, she felt almost  overflowing with life energy.  Every part  of her body shivered with electric tingles.  <p>
  And yet… despite how strange she felt, there was a  feeling of peace in her… like… like… like the way she had always felt when  Ying-Ying had held her and stroked her hair after she had gotten into trouble  with her aunt once again… or after Sung Li had tormented her…<p>
  Even walking through the rain with Rei in soaking wet  dresses, the memory made Zhu Shu smile.<p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;I am here.  Always and forever, I am here.&gt;&gt;</em></p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“What do you mean the trace has changed?” Luna asked  Ami. “Has it jumped again?”<p>
  Ami looked up from the computer and looked to where  Luna was trying to stay dry while Usagi combed the water out of her tails. “It  hasn’t jumped, but it has changed drastically. Her magic trace seems to have been  altered, and the Silver Millennium trace is now diffused into the rest. It’s  much harder to filter out now, but it hasn’t dropped in strength.  If anything, her <em>overall</em> energy levels are higher now than when I scanned her  earlier this evening.”<p>
  “And you say she absorbed and used the power of <em>all</em> of your attacks?” The black cat was  wide eyed. <p>
  “And the monster’s.   She practically set the air around her ablaze. I can’t figure it out  yet.”<p>
  Luna looked to Artemis. “Is she a hidden scout?”<p>
  Artemis shook his head. “I don’t know. I don’t  remember anyone like her.”<p>
  Makoto and Minako looked at the cats. “So what do we  do in the mean time?” Minako asked.<p>
  Artemis looked at Luna for a long moment. “For now, we  do nothing. I need to research this.” The white cat said finally. “At least,  for now, we know she’s safe, and on our side.”<p>
  “What’s going on with our sensei?”  Makoto   “Is she going to be okay?”<p>
  Artemis looked at her.   “I don’t know.  I’ve never seen  anything like this before.”<p>
  “Well, she’s certainly proven she’s capable of being a  Senshi.  I think we can trust her,  Artemis.  Maybe we should tell her what’s  happening.  She might know something  about it.” Luna said<p>
  The white cat disagreed.  “No.   It’s too dangerous when we don’t know what’s going on.  Until we know for certain, we must protect  her as much as we would any normal human.”<p>
  “Yeah, but didn’t you see that outfit she was wearing  when she was being healed?”  Usagi said  as she fell to the bed.  “She’s, like,  gotta be a Senshi!”  <p>
  “I don’t think she is, Usagi.  I need to see what I can find out before  anyone says anything to her.”<p>
  Usagi pouted.   “Alright, but she’d be a great Senshi.”<p>
  The other girls chimed in their agreement as the white  cat buried his face in his paws.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Nabiki stared blearily at the morning paper and  wondered if she should be shocked. She was barely awake enough to actually  care, but still…<p>
  She had still been standing in front of the dojo when  Akane, Ranma, and Shan Pu had come home. She had listened incredulously as they  had told her the story of Zhu Shu’s death and revival. She was glad Zhu Shu was  alive, but it had just been too much to assimilate. And now…<p>
  The Headline read “A NEW SENSHI?” and had a brief  description of the battle, but it was the picture that horrified her.<p>
  It had apparently been taken by a brave photographer  during the battle. It was a telephoto of the so-called new Senshi, as sharp and  clear as most Senshi photos were blurry, and despite the gold fuku and the halo  of gold light, it was recognizably Zhu Shu in her cursed form.   <p>
  She sighed heavily.   For all her skill at manipulating information, this was <em>way</em> out of her league. <p>
  Too many people at Furinkan knew what Zhu Shu looked  like in both forms, and they knew she lived at the Tendos. The last thing they  needed was Senshi level threats showing up at their door.  Shan Pu and Akane where destructive enough on  their own.<p>
  She needed help on this one… it just required too much  spin control. <p>
  She pulled out her new cell phone and hit the speed dial. </p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Kasumi was bleary eyed, but happy once more. The news  Akane had delivered the night before had nearly destroyed her indestructible  calm, and she had numbly cleaned a spotless kitchen for hours until Akane and  Ranma had told her that Zhu Shu was alive again, then she had fainted. They had  gotten her into a chair, and gotten some tea in her and she had finally  realized how upset she had been, and how relieved she was at the news. It had  been as devastating as the loss of her mother… or as it would be if she lost  Akane or Nabiki.<p>
  But the news she was all right had restored her. The  news she would be home in a day or so had cheered her up, and it had enabled  her to revive enough of her usual self to notice that Ranma and Akane had been  particularly wan and drawn. She had finally gotten them to drink the tea she  had made ‘to fight off the chill’ and the herbs would keep them out for most of  the day. Then she had crawled into bed herself. Only habit had woken her up  this morning to make breakfast. <p>
  She took the first dishes out to the dining room, only  to find a sleepy Nabiki already sitting there. She was just setting down a cell  phone and looking worriedly at the paper.<p>
  “Good morning, Nabiki. Is something wrong?”<p>
  Nabiki nodded. “Yeah, when Akane came home and told me  Zhu Shu had been involved a fight alongside the Sailor Senshi, I figured I  better check the paper this morning.” She turned the paper and shoved it  towards Kasumi.<p>
  “Oh, my! Doesn’t she look just like a Sailor Senshi.”<p>
  “That’s the problem.” Nabiki said glumly. “This is  going to be a bigger problem than when you frenched her on the subway.”<p>
  Kasumi sniffed. “I didn’t think that was a problem.  She deserved a good kiss.”<p>
  Nabiki gave her the eye. “It wasn’t the kiss,  Kasumi.  It was the <em>photos</em>.  Same here. It  wouldn’t matter that Zhu Shu helped out the Sailor Senshi if she hadn’t been  photographed doing it. I just got off the phone with Tao-Ching about spin  doctors.” A slightly dreamy look came to her eyes as she mentioned Ryouga’s  cousin.<p>
  Kasumi nodded. “I’m sure you’ll work it out.” She  checked mentioning the morning paper to Nabiki off her mental to-do list.  Nabiki had already prescribed her own therapy to deal with the residual  emotional stresses without Kasumi’s prompting. Kasumi’s smile grew a little  wider as she went back into the kitchen to finish her father’s cure to the  aftereffects of <em>his</em> therapy. She  hummed happily.<p>
  Her family had survived another storm intact… that was  all that mattered.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Rei stood in the doorway, watching the soft rise and  fall of Zhu Shu’s chest as she slept. She had tried to sleep following the  fight last night, but her dreams had been chaotic and emotionally draining. She  had gotten up a dozen times in the night to reassure herself that Zhu Shu was still  alive. <p>
  She sighed softly, her relief that Zhu Shu was really  there easing the tangled whirl of doubts and fears her dreams had raised. She  smiled at the sleeping girl and contemplated on how happiness felt. <p>
  It had been so wonderful last night. Zhu Shu had done  so much to make her feel like a star, and she had been so beautiful once Zhu  Shu had done her make up. She had felt the eyes of every male they had passed  last night, and it had felt so wonderful, like she had imagined it would feel  when she was a pop idol. Zhu Shu had made sure she was in the spotlight, had  made her feel <em>special</em>, like no boy  she had dated had ever done. She’d admit to her share of raging hormones, and  to masturbating furiously to thoughts of this or that handsome boy making love to  her, but even the best of them could make her feel like a trophy, or a piece of  meat.  <p>
  Zhu Shu hadn’t. She’d made her feel graceful, poised,  confident, but still herself. She’d been a mighty warrior in her past life, a  life she could only remember vague memories of, but in this life, she had felt  like a pretender to a destiny that try as she might, she didn’t always feel up  to accomplishing. For all that had happened, she still felt like an imposter at  times. A girl pretending to be Sailor Mars. <p>
  Then, when the creature had attacked, Zhu Shu’s  confidence in her had made her feel like she had in her memories, like a  valiant warrior fighting evil to defend the Kingdom of the Moon.  The kiss they had shared had made her feel  that she could defeat anything. <p>
  Then, having Zhu Shu show up to aid her and the other  Senshi, it had been what she sometimes was so jealous of Sailor Moon and Tuxedo  Kamen for, someone who had stood to give her aid when she needed it, someone  who could watch her back. She had been proud when Zhu Shu had defeated the  creature by combining all of their powers.<p>
  And then Zhu Shu had fallen. Watching her, Rei had  felt all of time stop. She had tried to move, to run, to catch her, but her  body just couldn’t push it’s way through the concrete the air had become. Zhu  Shu had been there to save <em>her</em>, but <em>she</em> couldn’t save Zhu Shu. <p>
  She had failed at the only thing that had any meaning  at that moment.<p>
  In that one second, everything she was, everything she  had felt, every emotion she had ever had concerning Zhu Shu had laid itself out  with perfect clarity, and she had known, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that she  had failed someone she cared very much for. <p>
  She liked boys, perhaps even a little too much. Last  night had proven that quite well. She had loved having all of the male  attention…<p>
  But Zhu Shu had a way that made her feel special -  like she already was everything she aspired to be. When Zhu Shu had smiled at  her, she had <em>felt </em>like a superstar,  like she was the most important person in the world.  No man she had ever met had done that, had  made her feel... <em>accepted</em>... like Zhu  Shu had.<p>
  She examined the sleeping girl’s body, admiring every  curve. She had never felt like this about any girl she had ever known… never  fantasized about what it would be like to explore her body, feel her caresses  returned. <p>
  Could it really be love? <p>
  Zhu Shu turned in her sleep, the gold and crimson  Dragon on her back catching the dim rays of the rising sun in a flash of  dazzling light, and Rei suddenly found herself in a vision.<p>
  An image of the Dragon formed in her mind, riding on a  huge banner above a throne towards which she was walking, an Emissary of the Moon Kingdom,  Sailor Mars. Her head was lowered respectfully as she ascended the dais to meet  the woman who sat upon the throne, and she heard a voice announce her. <p>
  “My I present to you the Emissary sent by our ally,  Queen Serenity of the Moon   Kingdom, my Empress. One  of the Royal Guardians, Sailor Mars.” <p>
  Rei raised her eyes to take her first look at the  woman on the throne, the woman that Serenity had called one of Endymion’s  strongest allies next to his five Generals, and found herself lost within Zhu  Shu’s emerald green eyes…<p>
  Then, the vision was gone, and there was only a fall  of golden dust in the sunlight highlighting Zhu Shu’s tattoo. Rei stepped back  from the door, her heart hammering.<p>
  Was it a real memory? Had Zhu Shu been part of the  Silver Millennium?<p>
  Had Rei known her then, too?<p>
  She stood in the shadows for a long time… but no  answers came out of the dark.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Rei finally fell asleep, and the day passed slowly.  The other Senshi slept in, missing school for once for a reason other than  battle. Ranma, Akane and Shan Pu continued sleeping, Kasumi finally took a nap,  and Nabiki spent most of the day on the phone. Soun and Genma finally awoke and  availed themselves of the ample supply of hangover remedy that Kasumi had left  for them. Luna sat in the window sill while Usagi tossed and snored, waiting to  see if Artemis would contact her to let her know what he found out. Finally,  around mid afternoon, the cause of all the fuss awoke and quietly slipped out  of the temple to the koi pond to do her kata and meditate.<p>
  Zhu Shu had been unable to stay awake any longer than  it took to crawl out of her wet dress and collapse on the futon.  She had slept the sleep of the exhausted, and  could not remember any of her dreams beyond impressions of falling cherry  blossoms, but she had awakened still feeling vibrantly alive. She had slept  better than she had in years, and emotionally and physically, she felt  wonderful. Somehow, it felt like some enormous weight she had been carrying had  been lifted. Even more so than following her dream of Ying-Ying, she felt <em>happy</em>.<p>
  There were some disconcerting effects of having died.  She had gradually been growing accustomed to the raging emotions she had gotten  from Akane, and the whirlwind it had made of her own calm, but now, they were  gone. Only her own feelings remained. She still loved all three of them, but  the overwhelming urge to throw herself passionately into their combined  embraces had become a pleasant desire instead of a heartrending  compulsion.  <p>
  Beyond that, she had noticed as she had cleared her  chakra that her chi had somehow been changed as well. It was still a blend with  Akane, as it would always be so long as they were linked, but it had been  affected in other ways as well. The sheer amount of power she had drawn upon,  both from the Senshi, and that she absorbed from the creature, together with  the overload of her Final Attack had scoured out her pathways, both widening  and deepening them, and the chi that flowed through them had a feel she had  never experienced before. Her chi had always flowed through her like a stream  of warm water, but now, it was like a broad river, placid and deep.  And there was an electric feel to it, unlike  anything she had ever felt before. When she had formed the chi talons of the  Dragons Claw, the golden energy had borne an undertone of silver.<p>
  It was mystifying, but livable. In all other respects,  her chi was behaving normally. As best as she could tell, it seemed she was  once again who she had been before her strange merger with Akane.<p>
  In a way, that was a disappointment. She could still  recall some of the events of Akane’s life, but no longer were they inseparable  from her memories. It was more like they had grown up together. But along with  that sense of separateness, she had lost some of the knowledge she had gained.  She could recall memories of Akane’s lessons with her father, but the actual  skills of the Anything Goes school were little more than a memorized set of  poses.  She had tried a few stances, and  they felt alien, unnatural.  She had no  doubt that with practice she could master them, but it would take months if not  years to acquire them as her own.  Along  with the blurring of those memories, she had lost the easy command of Japanese  Akane had as a native speaker. She still understood it perfectly, and quite a  few more of the written characters made sense to her now, but she was back to  the broken speech patterns that Rei kept telling her were absolutely adorable. It  was frustrating, but again, livable. <p>
  She searched the back of her mind and found the bond  that their merger had formed was still as strong as ever. She and Akane were  still as linked as if they had shared the womb together. Her blood link to Shan  Pu was still there as well, and… <p>
  She froze when she came across what seemed to be  another link, one so faint that had she not been examining herself so closely,  she never would have found it. Hesitantly, she reached out mentally to touch  it.<p>
  She fought against the tears when she realized it was  the remnants of her link to Ying-Ying. She had believed it forever lost the day  she had felt her die, but still, some small part remained, still faintly warm  to her soul…<p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;I am here...&gt;&gt;</em> The faint memories of her dream echoed. <em>&lt;&lt;I am always and forever… here…&gt;&gt;</em><p>
  And finally… her tears were gone. For the first time  since she had lost Ying-Ying, the darkness of her grief was fading into the light.  As she sat in the stillness of the afternoon sunlight, the sakura blossoms  falling around her like perfumed snow, she finally understood what her dreams  had been telling her for so long. Even though Ying-Ying was gone, that part of  her that could stay had never left her. Her memories, her feelings, her love…  they were still as much a part of her as they had been when Ying-Ying had been  alive.<p>
  And only her long walling away of her grief had hidden  that.<p>
  She held onto the single small strand of the link in  her mind as she whispered “I finally understand…”<p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;I am here…&gt;&gt;</em> Ying-Ying’s memories said once again. <em>&lt;&lt;I am always and forever…  here…&gt;&gt;</em><p>
  For a long timeless eternity, Zhu Shu held onto the  link, feeling its faint warmness, drawing strength from it, chasing the last of  grief’s chill from her soul.<p>
  And with the final release of that grief, Zhu Shu  found herself finally at peace with her feelings for Akane. Yes, she loved her,  but she had made the right choice. Akane had to learn to live with her new  family, with Ranma and Shan Pu. She could help Akane with that, and her love  for Akane would make her try all the harder to see her new sister happy. Once  her quest had been fulfilled, <em>if</em> her  husband would permit it, she would be overjoyed to be allowed to share Akane  and Shan Pu’s attentions, and possibly even willing to join Ranma as well, but  for now she was content.  If it was meant  to be, it would come in its proper time.<p>
  Which left her with the question of Rei. <p>
  Rei Hino had been her first friend among the Sailor  Senshi, trying hard to make up for having attacked her, and Zhu Shu <em>did</em> like her very much, but she was two  years younger, and very confused about her feelings. Akane had shown traits  that had made Zhu Shu suspect she wouldn’t be adverse to the marriage to Shan  Pu if she could be made to examine herself, but Rei was as boy crazy as they  came - all the Senshi were. Why was Rei so fascinated with her?  She couldn’t deny she found the girl  incredibly attractive, and was more than willing to allow Rei to date her, and  find out for herself how far she went in her attraction to Zhu Shu, but she  still worried that she was leading the girl on somehow.<p>
  She sighed, still touching the link to Ying-Ying. And  suddenly an answer came to her. It might be because she was young, and Zhu Shu  expressed a side of sexuality that she may have had little contact with before.  With Rei being a priestess, she had a personality that sought to explore  further, to find the limits of her own feelings.  So perhaps it was really more of a question  of how far Rei truly wanted to explore. <p>
  And for that, only time would tell.  If that was what she truly sought, Zhu Shu  would happily share as much of herself as the miko desired.  It had been most a year since she had shared  her body with Sarhia, and she had only resisted Shan Pu’s advances out of fear  of harming her sister’s future relationship with Ranma.  So long as Rei took that step of her own free  will, she could accept her with a clear conscience.<p>
  Reassured, Zhu Shu reluctantly let go of the link as  she slowly allowed herself to refocus on the outside world.  She blinked in the afternoon sun and smiled  as she watched the sakura blossoms float by.<p>
  It was funny really. She felt better about everything  than she had in years. Even her hopeless, doomed quest didn’t seem as dark as  it had. She had her dream of Ying-Ying’s promise it would not end as badly as  she feared… that there was a male out there who she could actually love and  desire. <p>
  Death, it seemed, had been wonderfully therapeutic…<p>
  In her room, Rei opened sleepy eyes to a sound she had  never heard before. Zhu Shu had chuckled, even giggled, but Rei had never heard  her laugh…<p>
  As sleep claimed her once more, she smiled. It had  been good to hear.</p>

<p><em>Tokyo</em><em> Evening News  late breaking story: Revealed to the world today were Hibiki Studio’s plans for  a new Sailor V movie involving the Sailor Senshi.  This press release followed an unscheduled  publicity stunt in the Juuban Ginza last night which reporters mistook for a  real battle involving the Senshi. Studio officials blame a misfiled memo for  the failure of the Studio to properly notify city officials of the multi  million yen stunt which showcased a prototype of a new costume for Sailor V.  The Studio has issued formal apologies and is paying for the repairs to the  damaged buildings. The Marketing Department officer responsible for misfiling  the report has been disciplined. Following these commercials, we’ll bring you  exclusive photos of the monster, and later, our exclusive interview with Minako  Aino, Sailor V!</em></p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Nabiki put down the cell phone and breathed a sigh of  relief. Tao-Ching had told her it seemed the whole idea of making it seem like  a publicity stunt was working. The phones to the studio and the web site had  been hammered since the press release and no-one seemed to be taking it as  anything else.  She was glad Kasumi had  all of Zhu Shu’s student’s numbers. It had been a flash of brilliance to talk  Minako into covering for her sensei like that, and it seemed the girl had a bad  case of Senshi worship. She’d been overjoyed at the whole thing and Tao-Ching  had decided that actually going ahead and making the movie could be a  worthwhile investment. He was even seriously considering auditioning Minako’s  friends to play the parts of the Senshi, and having Zhu Shu play Sailor Venus.  Nabiki had to agree they certainly looked…<p>
  She looked out the kitchen window at the ruins of the  dojo, where the voodoo priest, Sandal, was slowly clearing away the debris in  preparation of rebuilding it, per his agreement with Nabiki for room and board,  and contemplated the unfinished thought. <p>
  How had Zhu Shu been in the area to help the Senshi?  Why had she risked so much to help complete strangers?<p>
  Or <em>were</em> they?<p>
  She tabled the question while Kasumi brought out  breakfast and Ranma dragged herself out of the koi pond, where she had ended up  after the early morning sparring match with Genma. Akane sauntered down the  steps and gave the redhead a sidelong look that Nabiki would have said was  admiring if she hadn’t immediately bopped Ranma in the back of the head and  told her to put her shirt back on.   Still, her voice sounded more affectionate than annoyed. Shan Pu came  down the steps a few seconds later, yawning and stretching like a cat woken  from a nap. She gave both her fiancées a lingering look and settled down  between them at the table, frowning at both of them when they edged further  apart.<p>
  Nabiki watched them out of the corner of her eye as  she told Kasumi about how her and Tao-Ching’s efforts had worked out. She  noticed both Akane and Ranma start at the mention of the Juuban girls playing  the part of the Senshi. Oh, yes - there was definitely something there.<p>
  She jotted down a few notes to remind her of avenues  of investigation as she finished getting ready for school, hearing Kasumi greet  Ke Lun as Shan Pu’s grandmother came to pick up the Amazon to return to the  village for preparations, then wandered downstairs to find Zhu Shu waiting for  her at the gate to the street. <p>
  “Ni hao, Nabi-chan.”<p>
  “Oh, good morning Zhu Shu. I- I wasn’t expecting to  see you.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu know. Zhu Shu feel much better. Decide go  school.”<p>
  “Ah… I see. Well… I’m glad to see you up and around. I…  um… kinda thought you might be out of it for a few days because of… well… um…”<p>
  “No. Zhu Shu all ok. Not even remember dying.”<p>
  Nabiki blinked twice. Then even her ice princess  façade broke. “Oh, god’s Zhu Shu, We thought we’d lost you,” she cried as she  flung her arms around the small Chinese girl.<p>
  Zhu Shu patted her head. “Is okay. Zhu Shu is okay  now. Zhu Shu miss family.  Miss Nabiki  and Kasumi and Akane and Ranma and fathers. Zhu Shu come home. <p>
  Once more in control after the brief display of  affection, Nabiki self-consciously straightened her skirt. “We missed you too.”  Then she did a double take. “Hey, your accent’s back.”<p>
  Zhu Shu rolled her eyes. “Yes, yes. Accent back. No,  Zhu Shu not know why.”<p>
  Nabiki laughed. “I take it you’ve gotten that a lot.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Rei and Usagi and Minako and Ami and  Makoto all feel need point out what Zhu Shu already know.”<p>
  Nabiki laughed as she hooked her arm through Zhu  Shu’s. “Well, we better get going or there will be a mob scene when the family  finds out you’re here. I’d just as soon deal with that after school.”<p>
  Zhu Shu laughed. “Yes, yes. Or will be late.”<p>
  “Exactly.”<p>
  They walked towards the school, Nabiki studying Zhu  Shu sidelong, watching as she looked around and dodged the old lady throwing  out water on the sidewalk. There was something different about the Chinese girl…  Something faint beyond the glow of contentment she was exuding. It took her  most of the walk to school to pin it down, because it wasn’t something that had  been added, it was the loss of something so faint and so much a part of what  Zhu Shu had been that only its absence made it noticeable.<p>
  The faint bittersweet tint of melancholy was gone, and  with it had gone a tenseness that had never been noticeable. For the first time  since Nabiki had known her, Zhu Shu felt like a seventeen year old girl,  instead of ageless… <p>
  And she was definitely more at peace with herself  about something. Her eyes would every now and then lose focus and she would  assume an expression that Nabiki could only interpret as fond happiness… an  expression she had learned quite well recently from seeing it in the mirror so  often when she thought of Tao-Ching.<p>
  Had Zhu Shu found <em>herself</em> a new lover?<p>
  Yet something else to investigate. Nabiki could barely  wait to get to school to start her minions digging…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Akane breathed a sigh of relief. At last she could  relax. Ke Lun and Shan Pu had left for China and she didn’t have to deal  with the Amazon until the weekend. She’d already had to go out and smash more  of the destroyed dojo into kindling about thirty or so times, reminding herself  over and over that Shan Pu was supposed to flirt with Ranma.<p>
  It was proving incredibly difficult.<p>
  To Ranma’s credit, though, at least from Akane’s  viewpoint, was the fact that he seemed to have the same problem when Shan Pu  flirted with her. Between the two of them, Sandal had complained that they were  wrecking the dojo’s foundation.<p>
  At least she wouldn’t be waking up to find a nude Shan  Pu curled up in bed with her tonight, and she wouldn’t have to apologize to  Ranma again for knocking him through the floor like she had last night when she  had found Shan Pu curled up with him. <p>
  Well… if it hadn’t been for the fact that his hand had  been cupping her breast, Akane might not have been so mad.<p>
  She sighed again. The Amazon made Zhu Shu easy to  understand by comparison. She could be a vicious opponent to anyone who crossed  her, but once she had decided to give her heart to someone, it seemed she  became an incredibly affectionate person. There were times Akane could almost  swear she was purring at the least show of physical affection. She was like a  damn cat!<p>
  Not that she’d ever understood cats any better,  either.<p>
  She was <em>trying</em>,  she really was, for Zhu Shu’s sake, to get along with Shan Pu, even to try and  accept her advances, but the sheer intensity of Shan Pu’s emotions were a  little unnerving. Zhu Shu had always been calm and reserved - even her  mischievous moods had been subtle - but nothing about the Amazon could be  called subtle by any definition of the word. She was an inferno when angry, an  iceberg when offended, a warm fire when pleased. She let you know what she felt  about everything, especially her desires.   She had wanted her Ai Ren’s physical affections badly, and had been  disappointed at their reluctance.<p>
  Akane sighed again.<p>
  “What’s up Akane?” Ranma asked from where he was  walking along a fence top. “You’re starting to sound like an old steam train.”<p>
  She glared at him, then decided he hadn’t meant it as  an insult, so she shrugged. “Shan Pu.”<p>
  “Oh…” He looked off across the canal.<p>
  “Ranma? How do <em>you</em> feel about her?” Akane asked seriously.<p>
  Ranma shrugged. “I dunno really. She still makes me  jump ever time I turn around and see her. I mean, I thought she was trying to  kill me, and now? I mean, I want to make her happy for Zhu Shu and Mom’s sake,  but I just don’t know how.” He looked down at his feet. “She seems to be a  really sweet girl when she isn’t trying to kill you, but I still barely know  her.”<p>
  “You barely knew me until Zhu Shu came along and  helped us.”<p>
  Ranma sighed. “Yeah.”<p>
  “Missing her?”<p>
  He nodded. “Yeah. I mean, I know she needed some time  to think and all, but it’s been miserable without her.” He shook his head. “I  hope she comes home soon.”<p>
  Akane nodded.<p>
  Ranma hopped down from the fence and walked the last  fifty feet to the school yard, where Kuno was waiting, bokken in hand.<p>
  “Ranma Saotome! Vile Sorcerer! Undo the enchantment thou  hast lain upon mine sister!”<p>
  “Huh?” asked a genuinely confused Ranma.<p>
  “Release her from thine foul enchantment or face the  wrath of Blue Thunder!”<p>
  “What are you talking about Kuno?”<p>
  “You’re getting tiresome, brother dear.” Kodachi’s  voice said behind Ranma, and he and Akane whirled to see her dressed in a  Furinkan high uniform.  “And on my first  day too.”<p>
  Ranma and Akane’s jaws dropped as she stepped forward  and knelt in front of Akane. “Shall I get rid of him, mistress? It would not do  for you to waste time on such foolishness.” The eyes she turned to Akane were  so full of adoration that Akane backed up a step. <p>
  “Wretch! Villain! Release her from this curse! Release  her, I command you!” He swung his bokken at Ranma, who dodged as the blow  shattered the wall behind him.<p>
  Akane flinched as shrapnel pelted her, one shard  cutting her cheek slightly. <p>
  “<em>Mistress!</em>”  Kodachi’s cry was anguished, then she turned towards Kuno in a rage. “Demon!  You have wounded my beloved goddess! Feel the wrath of the Black Rose!”<p>
  Kuno, still vainly trying to hit Ranma, was caught  from behind by Kodachi’s ribbons and flung head first into a tree, then when he  bounced, was hurled into another. “Thrice cursed brother! How dare you injure  my Mistress!”<p>
  Ranma stared from his perch on the gate. Even he’d  never trashed Kuno this bad. <p>
  “Whoa, ‘Dachi! You’re gonna kill him!”<p>
  “He deserves death! He has wounded my beloved  goddess!” She slammed her unconscious brother into the wall.<p>
  “Kodachi! Please stop!” Akane cried, horrified.<p>
  Kuno’s battered form crashed to the ground as Kodachi  bowed in front of Akane again. “Yes, my divine Mistress.”<p>
  Akane took a step back, then another, then turned and  ran into the school, followed by a bouncing Kodachi crying “Mistress!!!”<p>
  Ranma looked around at the smashed trees and wall,  then down to the unconscious Kuno and shook his head. “Great, as if we didn’t  have enough problems already…”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Artemis looked out the window of Minako’s room and  sighed. “Anything at all that you can tell me will help, Pluto. I certainly  don’t seem to recall anyone like her in the Moon Kingdom.”  He told the tall green haired girl sitting on the bed.<p>
  “I wish I could, Artemis. But her stream is in flux.  Someone or something is preventing me from actually analyzing either her future  or her past.  It’s like I’m trying to  read a thousand streams all at once. All I can say is yes, she is a  Reincarnate, but I couldn’t tell you for certain who.”<p>
  The white cat scratched at his ear. “Best guess?”<p>
  The green hair girl shrugged. “She’s got a remarkably  uncanny resemblance to a young version of Song Lin Tzu, the Empress of China. Serenity  considered her one of her closest friends among the royalty.  She was even given an honorary position as a  Senshi, Sailor Earth. She was one of the few rulers who remained allied to  Serenity when Beryl convinced Endymion’s father to destroy the Moon Kingdom.  Mars spent over a year assigned to the Court of the Dragon as Serenity’s  emissary and grew quite close to her, as I recall. She was lost in the fighting  during the fall.”<p>
  “Empress Song?” Artemis blinked. “I had forgotten  about her.”<p>
  The green haired girl smiled. “Getting senile?”<p>
  Artemis turned and looked at her. “Are you aware of  the girl’s full name?”<p>
  “Zhu Shu? Yes. Means ‘Little Mouse’ in Mandarin.”<p>
  “No. I mean her full name. It’s Song Zhu Shu.”<p>
  “Interesting. The Dragon Empress wasn’t one of Earth’s  most influential rulers, but she had the distinction of being the only other  female besides Beryl. She stayed loyal to Serenity when the rest of Earth  betrayed their alliances. I’ve wondered more than once if it was because she  was in love with her highness. She shared Neptune  and Uranus’s tastes, so she might have been.   Her… um… <em>exuberance</em> for  sharing her affections was a small scandal actually. Empress Song had over a  dozen wives - which was no big deal for an Emperor, but was unheard of for a  Empress - and when she and several of her wives came up pregnant, well…  All she would say was that the Dragon, her  house’s guardian deity, had come to her. Like I said, she disappeared along  with all of her wives during the fall, so no-one really knows what happened to  her. Her brother was one of Beryl’s advisors, but he disappeared too.”<p>
  The white cat looked thoughtful. “Humm… well I guess I  can’t ask for more than that.  As for my  next mystery…” A small holo of the old woman appeared. “Do you know who this  is?”<p>
  Pluto looked at the holo and grew pale. She looked  from the silver staff in her hand to it’s golden twin in the old woman’s hand.  “Oh my…”<p>
  “Any ideas why you, or at least a very old you,  brought Sailor Saturn to heal Zhu Shu? Somehow, I have this feeling that the  answer to that could be very important”<p>
  She shook her head.   “That’s not me, Artemis.  That’s  my future incarnation, your currently unrevealed Pluto.  And at a best guess she’s from several  hundred millennia in the future, far past any era I have any knowledge of.  If she brought Saturn back from the future to  resurrect Zhu Shu, in violation of her duties as Guardian of the Gate of Time,  it could only have been because it was vitally necessary for the future that  she do so.  What her reasons were, I  can’t even begin to guess, but she had to have had two things to be able to do  it. Kami-Sama’s permission, and the aid of the Norn of the Past.  Once the absolute Now has crystallized the  timestream, only the combined efforts of all three of us could rewrite the  past.  It’s one of Kami-Sama’s absolute  laws.  He won’t even let me go back and  save Serenity in my present.”<p>
  Artemis blinked.   “I see.”<p>
  “I’d say you’re safer making sure Zhu Shu has as much  protection as you can give her without jeopardizing the princess’s  mission.  Whatever it is she’s supposed  to do, my future self would seem to be intent on making sure she’ll be able to  do it, but a little extra insurance never hurts.”<p>
  The white cat nodded.   “Usagi is all set to make her a Senshi.”<p>
  Pluto nodded.   “When Serenity made Lin Tzu an honorary Senshi, she did so in a small,  closed ceremony without the whole court. We figured it was something she did  out of friendship, so no-one seriously expected her to fight with the rest of  us, but Serenity might have known something she never told us.”<p>
  Artemis sighed.   “Looks like I’m going to be giving the princess what she wants  then.  At least I think Zhu Shu is  intelligent enough to use a wand wisely.”<p>
  Setsuna laughed.   “Which is often times more than can be said of the princess. Well I must  get back to help Saturn finish the Silencing.   If you need me again, you know how to call.”  She raised her staff again and waved before  fading into the timestream…</p>

<p>Urd was in a blue funk. She was setting on the steps  to the shrine across from the house, her hands propping up her head. Keichii  saw her as he pulled up from college and thought seriously about ignoring her,  but in the end, his kind nature won out over his good sense. He wandered over  and sat down next to her.<p>
  “Hi Urd. What’s up? Sake hangover again?”<p>
  Urd was so depressed she didn’t even blink. “I’m a  failure.  I’m doomed to end up a  demoness.” she moped.<p>
  “You’ve already been a demoness Urd.” Keiichi  shuddered as he remembered the mechanical monstrosity Urd had tried to flatten  the house with. “I’d rather not have that happen again. What’s got you so  depressed?”<p>
  “What else? This <em>wish</em> I’ve been assigned to. I thought once I got Shan Pu together with Akane and  Ranma it would be smooth sailing, but the whole mess just keeps getting more  tangled. Shan Pu loves them both without question, but they both keep pushing  her away and moping over Zhu Shu, who I thought would be my biggest help, but  now she’s become a stumbling block because while all three of them would be  willing to marry her, she <em>won’t </em>marry  them, and to top it off, she’s the Dragon’s mortal child, so I can’t just love  potion her into it because the Ultimate Force has some destiny in mind for her  that I have to try and accommodate in Shan Pu’s wish that every one involved is  eventually happy, but I don’t know what it is, and apparently <em>I</em> don’t want me to know what it is  because <em>I </em>locked myself out of my own  files on her and <em>I’ve </em>apparently been  meddling in the past, but I don’t know how because <em>I</em> haven’t seen fit to tell me, so I can’t make sense of any of this  mess and I’m going to fail and end up as a demoness because I can’t help one  lousy mortal to achieve her wish!!!”<p>
  Keiichi tried to puzzle out what Urd had said, having  caught only about half of the rapidly outpouring single sentence, but gave up  and offered her a clichéd response. “I’m sure you’ll figure it out.”<p>
  “I’m doomed.”<p>
  Keiichi frowned. He hated seeing anyone be down, even  Urd. He thought for a long moment before he had a bright idea. “Hey, just  figure out what the key problem is and maybe, if you solve that, the rest will  be easier.”<p>
  Urd snorted. “That’s easy! <em>Me</em> locking myself out of Yggdrasil’s data base.  Almost everything I’ve tried looking up to  help me is encrypted on <em>my</em> authority  and I don’t know what password <em>I</em> used! None of my regular ones work! Almost everything about the past beyond  about 400 years ago is encrypted, everything on Zhu Shu’s past is encrypted!  Hell, I only found out she was Legend’s Child when she was killed! How can I  pass my assignment when the information I need is locked up!<p>
  “I thought <em>Shan  Pu</em> was your assignment. Why so much interest in Zhu Shu?”<p>
  “Because she’s the-“ Urd broke off suddenly, her eyes  widening at a sudden thought. “Because she’s the key?” she asked wonderingly.<p>
  It couldn’t be that obvious could it?<p>
  She left Keiichi staring after her as she sprinted for  the TV.<p>
  In Heaven, she threw herself into the seat in front of  her backup station and typed one of her previously refused requests.<p>
  //PASSWORD?// Yggdrasil prompted.<p>
  “Z.H.U.S.H.U.” she hit the key as she held her breath.<p>
  //INVALID PASSWORD// The screen blinked at her before  the query returned.<p>
  Urd sighed. She had been so sure… She stared at the  screen morosely, the query blinking brightly. Then she thought of something.<p>
  “S.O.N.G.Z.H.U.S.H.U.” She hit the enter key without  much hope…<p>
  The massive computer hesitated for a few seconds, a  pause Urd hadn’t seen it do before. She started to set up in her chair…<p>
  A privacy screen snapped into existence around the  terminal, blocking out the rest of the room, and Urd’s mouth dropped.  It was a feature Yggdrasil had used  previously only when Kami-Sama himself had come to use the world computer.  She turned back to the console as the  speakers activated and a disembodied voice began to speak.<p>
  //PASSWORD ACCEPTED.   Greetings Goddess Urd.  I am  Project Phoenixmoon.  I have been waiting  for you…//<p>
  Much later, a very subdued, even slightly pale, Urd  entered the kitchen of the Morisato house.<p>
  “Belldandy… I think I need your help. I- I think I’m  in way over my head…”<p>
  Belldandy turned, her eyes wide. Urd, humbly asking  for help? She nodded and lead Urd to the table to discuss it, surprised, but  pleased at the same time. Maybe Urd was finally maturing?<p>
  On his throne in the Heavens, Kami-Sama nodded  approvingly. Urd was doing better… but her time wasn’t unlimited… Would she  succeed in time?<p>
  He prayed she would… so much hinged on it…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Zhu Shu stopped in surprise as she found her way  blocked by a tall blonde figure.  She had  been heading outside for lunch and hadn’t been expecting any trouble, but one  look at Ai put her on guard.<p>
  “You and me need to talk, China.”<p>
  “What hentai girl want?  Zhu Shu hungry.”<p>
  Ai gave her a leer.   “Me too.  That isn’t what we need  to talk about.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu have date.   No need hentai girl.”<p>
  “Okay, look, I’ll stop calling you China if you  stop with the hentai girl, okay?  This is  serious.”<p>
  Zhu Shu motioned to the door.  “Zhu Shu hungry.  Need talk, come eat with.”<p>
  Ai shrugged, the motion doing interesting things to  her anatomy.  She followed Zhu Shu out to  her favorite tree and raised an eyebrow when Zhu Shu pulled out her grill.  “You don’t bring a lunch?”<p>
  “Kasumi usually make.   Zhu Shu not home this morning.”<p>
  “Kasumi?  That  the name of your girlfriend?”<p>
  Zhu Shu gave her the eye.  “What Ai want?”<p>
  Ai looked around and finally sat down when she could  see that no one was near enough to overhear her.  “Well… actually… this is kind of  embarrassing.”<p>
  “What?”<p>
  Ai pulled out a big picture of Sailor Venus.  “Well, since you know the Sailor Senshi,  could you get Venus to give me an autograph?   I’m, like, totally in love with her!”<p>
  Zhu Shu blinked… then blinked again.  Finally Ai snapped her fingers in front of  her face and she started.<p>
  “Hey, she’s hot, okay?   I’d love to get her autograph, and whatever the news says, I know that  was you with them the other night.” Ai said defensively.<p>
  Zhu Shu giggled.   “Is just last thing Zhu Shu expect.”<p>
  “Well, you don’t have to laugh about it.” Ai growled.<p>
  “Zhu Shu not laugh at Ai.  She relieved Ai not want fight.  Zhu Shu much prefer Mars anyway.  Very cute.”<p>
  “Not half as cute as Venus!”<p>
  “Yes, yes.  Have  beautiful eyes.”<p>
  “Yeah, but Venus has such a hot body!”<p>
  As Zhu Shu finished cooking and she and Ai kept  comparing their favorite Senshi, the rest of the school looked on in surprise  at the two rivals having found at least one thing in common…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Akane had been overjoyed that Zhu Shu had come to  school and even having to dodge Kodachi all day hadn’t ruined that. She had  eagerly agreed when Zhu Shu had told her the Senshi were training at Rei’s  until the dojo was fixed, and invited her to come help still. It had been a  wonderful feeling having Zhu Shu trust her as an equal while teaching the  Juuban girls, though Usagi was jealous Akane had learned all of Zhu Shu’s  skills during their accidental chi merger. Both Zhu Shu and Akane warned her  that she did not want to deal with the side effects that it had caused. <p>
  After practice, Artemis and Luna called the Senshi to  a meeting, and for a wonder, asked Zhu Shu and Akane to stay. Akane raised an  eyebrow at being included, but was honored at the request.<p>
  After the girls checked to make sure Rei’s grandfather  was napping soundly and that Yuuchiriou was out on errands, they assembled in  Rei’s room, moving the massive manga collection around to get enough room for  Zhu Shu and Akane to set on the bed. Artemis and Luna sat down in the middle of  the table and looked at each other as the girls waited, looking like they were  nerving themselves up to speak. Finally Luna took a deep breath.<p>
  “I know this is unusual, but as this concerns Zhu Shu  and Akane as well, we figured they should be here too.” She looked at Artemis,  who nodded. “We-we have finally possibly found out some information on the  puzzle so recently dropped into our lap by Mercury.”<p>
  Zhu Shu raised an eyebrow. It wasn’t like Luna to talk  around a subject like that.<p>
  Luna raised her eyes to Zhu Shu. “I’m afraid Zhu-chan,  that we’ve been studying you. I do apologize, but there were several anomalies  about you that even now, we’re not completely sure of. Mercury, would you be so  kind as to show Zhu Shu what you showed us the other night?”<p>
  Mercury nodded and pulled out her minicomputer. She  tilted the small screen towards the two girls on the bed and pulled up her  readout. “When we first meet Zhu-chan, I took some readings of you that were  very puzzling.” She pointed out the relevant readings as she continued. “We  were tracking some magical spikes, well, we didn’t know they were magic at the  time, but we figured that out later, and we found you on top of this shrine. My  first readings showed you to be a normal human, but several strange things were  puzzling. Since then we figured out that they were your curse and your chi, but  you also possessed a trace of Silver Millennium energy too. When you woke up, I  took another scan, but didn’t review it for a while, and when I did, it became  apparent something strange had happened. Your Millennium trace had grown much  stronger. The odd thing was that Rei’s magic trace had grown too.”<p>
  Rei did a double blink. “It did? Why didn’t you tell me?”<p>
  Ami blushed. “Um… I wasn’t sure if my readings were  right at first, then we had that whole fight, and today’s the first day I’ve  seen you. I talked to Makoto and Usagi, but you go to TA Academy.”<p>
  “Oh.”<p>
  “Anyway, I wasn’t sure of my readings at first but I  showed them to everyone when you and Zhu Shu went to the movie because I had  taken one last scan before you went to the movies.” She called that one up.  “This is the one that made me kind of worried and made me decide to talk to  every one about it.”<p>
  Zhu Shu tilted her head. “Worried? For Zhu Shu?”<p>
  Ami nodded, along with Makoto, Minako, and Usagi. “If  you look here, you can see that somehow, your trace of Silver Millennium energy  has gone off the scale. You were radiating almost as much energy as the Silver  crystal does. We were worried you might be a beacon to any thing that doesn’t  like the Senshi , and almost as soon as we found out, a massive negative energy  spike started near where you and Rei were eating. We got there as fast as we  could and…” she looked away, struggling to control her voice. “Anyway, after it  was all over, I took one last reading. You still have as much power as you did  before the fight, but somehow, it’s diffused throughout your chi and the magic  of your curse. You aren’t a beacon anymore, but beyond that, I really don’t  know.” She turned to Luna. “Is that what this is about? Did you find out  something?”<p>
  Luna gave Artemis a look.  “We think so. It’s really hard to figure out  why this has occurred, but as best as we can figure, Zhu Shu is a reincarnated  warrior of the Earth   Kingdom, as you are  warriors of the Moon   Kingdom. She resembles,  and from what we have been able to find out, her abilities match those of one  of the few rulers of the Earth who sided with the Moon during the fall.” She  walked to the edge of the table and bowed before continuing. “We believe you  are the reincarnation of Song Lin Tzu, Daughter of the Dragon, and Empress of China during  the Silver Millennium.”<p>
  There were gasps of surprise around the table and a  protest from Zhu Shu. <p>
  “Zhu Shu not Empress. Zhu Shu is servant of Empress!  Zhu Shu is only servant!”<p>
  Luna nodded. “Whatever your bloodline, you must be the  heir of Song Lin Tzu’s powers. You are still young, but already you possess  much of her strength and abilities.”<p>
  “The Dragon…” Rei murmured, then looked up at Zhu Shu.  “She called you The Dragon.”<p>
  “Who?” Zhu Shu asked.<p>
  “The old woman, the one who brought the girl who  healed you. She called <em>you</em> the  Dragon. And I had a vision of you, but you were older, sitting on a throne  under a Dragon banner. You were wearing a gold crown and had long golden  fingernails, and I heard a voice announcing me to… to the Empress.”<p>
  Zhu Shu stared wide eyed until Akane laid her hand on  her shoulder. “Isn’t it wonderful Zhu Shu? You have royal ancestors!”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head. “Zhu Shu not know… Zhu Shu is  servant.”<p>
  Artemis stepped up. “There is more.” He turned to  Mercury. “Would you show us Akane’s scan?”<p>
  Mercury nodded. A quick tap of her fingers on the key  board showed Akane’s readings. For a long moment no-one spoke as the readouts  on the screen registered, then Akane looked to Artemis.<p>
  “Why do I have the strange feeling that it isn’t  normal for someone to have that high a level of Silver Millennium energy?”<p>
  Artemis looked her in the eye. “Because it isn’t. You  are a little weaker than any of the Senshi, but not by much. At best as we can  figure, it’s another side effect of your little accident.” He sighed. “As it  is, we can’t just let you walk around completely unprotected.” He walked over  to a small bag and nosed out two items. The smaller one was a slim wand topped  by a heart, which he nosed over towards Akane. “This is a communication pen.  It’s capable of reaching any of the Senshi and calling them for aid if you are  every in danger.”<p>
  Akane took the pen and looked at it with a raised  eyebrow. “Great… on top of every thing else, now I have to worry about weird  creatures?” She shook her head.  “Well at  least you aren’t asking me to become a Senshi.   I have enough headaches already.”<p>
  Luna spoke up. “We wouldn’t ask that of you Akane. We  simply wish to try and keep you safe. You know too much about us, and even  though we don’t believe you are a reincarnated Senshi, the power you possess  could be dangerous if you fell into the wrong hands.”<p>
  “Why Zhu Shu pen different?” Zhu Shu asked looking at  the larger wand. It was gold and the heart-shaped end bore a small circle  around a dot, like the one at the base of her spine..<p>
  Luna looked at Artemis, who sighed. The black cat  nodded to himself, then pushed the wand to Zhu Shu. “Luna disagrees with me on  this, but this is a transformation pen. It has all of the powers of one of the  Senshi pens.  We are not asking you to be  a Senshi, and we don’t know for certain what this will do if you ever have to  use it.  It is the pen Queen Serenity  gave to Empress Song when she was made an honorary Senshi.  It is being given to you solely because you  have so much Silver Millennium energy.   Like Akane’s, if you find yourself in danger, please use it to call the  Senshi. Only in direst need should you use its other functions. You were a  warrior of the Earth   Kingdom, not the Moon,  and we cannot predict exactly what effect a transformation may have.”<p>
  “What about that vision we- Owwww…” Usagi rubbed her  side where Minako’s elbow had collided with her ribs sharply.<p>
  Zhu Shu raised an eyebrow. Vision? Obviously from the  glares Usagi was getting from the other Senshi, it was something they didn’t  want to talk about. But now wasn’t the time. She turned back to Artemis.<p>
  “As I was saying,” the cat continued “We are giving  you this only for a dire emergency.”<p>
  “What say to activate?”<p>
  Artemis gave a small smile “Um… actually...  it’s Earth Crystal Power, Makeup.  Empress Song was the only Senshi not named  for a celestial body.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu sees. Well, Zhu Shu keep, but likely not  need. Senshi depend on pen too much.”<p>
  “Most likely. The Sailor Senshi were born to fight  evil, but you are not a Senshi. Were the risk of leaving you defenseless not so  great, we would never have considered this.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu not defenseless. But understand. Will keep  pen for emergency.”<p>
  Luna breathed a sigh of relief. “Well, that’s pretty  much what we wanted to meet about. Did you have anything you wanted to discuss  about practice today?”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded and gave out her end of class pointers.  Following that, the group broke up, leaving Akane, Rei, and Zhu Shu alone at  the Shrine. Before Akane could head out, Rei stopped her. “Could you help me  and Zhu Shu pack her things?”<p>
  “Huh?” Akane was taken by surprise. “Where’s she  going?”<p>
  “Back home to your place, where else?” Rei said with a  smile.<p>
  “B-but I thought…”<p>
  “Zhu Shu had enough time. Miss new family too much.  Feel much better.  Besides, Akane and  Ranma need Zhu Shu,” the Chinese girl said with grin.<p>
  “Yes.”<p>
  Rei smiled. “And I can vouch for how much she misses  you.”<p>
  Akane smiled shyly. “Well, I’m glad you’re coming  home.”<p>
  They crossed the hall to the room Zhu Shu was staying  in and as Rei and Akane started carefully folding the few dresses Zhu Shu had  brought, Zhu Shu excused herself to go and get snacks. She gave both Rei and  Akane kisses on the cheek before she left…<p>
  Rei looked after her and as the door slid closed and  the faint sound of Zhu Shu’s footsteps faded. “She always does that.”<p>
  “What?”<p>
  “Reads people’s minds. Somehow she knew I wanted to  talk to you alone.”<p>
  Akane raised an eyebrow. “About what?”<p>
  Rei sat down in a chair by the futon. “Do you have any  idea how jealous of you I am?”<p>
  Akane raised an eyebrow. “I? Make you jealous?”<p>
  Rei twisted a strand of her hair. “Yeah. I mean, you  know you love Ranma, and you know you love <em>her</em>…  I wish I knew for certain how I feel…”<p>
  Akane somehow controlled the overwhelming stab of  jealousy. “About Zhu Shu?”<p>
  Rei nodded. <p>
  Akane sat down on the futon. “Why?”<p>
  “I- I…” Rei blushed furiously. “I know that you love  her, and I know that you’re getting betrothed to Shan Pu in a few days, and  well…” She couldn’t meet Akane’s eyes. “I- I just don’t know if what I feel  means I’m in  love with Zhu Shu too…”<p>
  Almost, her gut reaction kicked in. Her first impulse  was to hammer Rei into the ground, but the side of her that considered the  younger girl a best friend made her stop and think for just a millisecond, and  that was all it took for the part she had gained from Zhu Shu to assert itself.  Rei was her friend, and as much as she loved Zhu Shu, she was engaged to Ranma,  and about to be engaged to Shan Pu, her love for Zhu Shu would never be  consummated, and she wished Zhu Shu happiness. If Rei could give her that  happiness, well… wasn’t that what she wanted anyway?<p>
  Ahh… but those instincts were so hard to fight.<p>
  She put the giant red hammer back behind her back and  gave Rei a rueful grin. “I’m sorry Rei. My jealous streak was showing.”<p>
  Rei blinked twice at her, too shocked at narrowly  being missed by the huge weapon. “Um… “<p>
  Akane held out her hand. “I <em>am</em> sorry Rei. I do want Zhu Shu to be happy, and we can never be  more than sisters. I- I think it would be wonderful if you could make her happy…just… <em>unexpected.</em>”<p>
  Rei nodded. “Um… well… I just don’t know though. I  mean, she’s so…  so…”<p>
  “Zhu Shu.” Akane finished. “I know. Believe me, Rei.  When Zhu Shu and I first met, I was totally shocked to find out she liked  girls. I had never even contemplated a relationship with a girl, if anything, I  thought that even thinking about something like that was perverted. Then I  found myself in a relationship with Ranma, and he spends half his time as a  girl. It really freaked me out at first, but Zhu Shu showed me how ridiculous I  was about it. She just seems to exude this aura of desirability because of what  she’s been trained to do, but she never consciously uses it. I mean, her aunt  made her learn everything there was to know about pleasing a man on the off  chance that an Emperor would desire her as a concubine, and I have all the  memories of that training in my head. I studiously try to avoid thinking about  it, because otherwise I’d die of blushing. But because of it, because it was  drummed into her just as hard as her martial arts, she can’t help but be sexy.”<p>
  Rei nodded. “I know. I caught her practicing one  morning and I just couldn’t get her beautiful body out of my head.” She curled  up on herself.  “Does that mean I’m  really gay?”<p>
  Akane shook her head. “No. I’ve seen the way you look  at Yuuchiriou when he’s not looking, and I’ve listened to too many of you  girl’s conversation on boyfriends. At most, it means you’re like me. I finally  realized I like girls as much as guys, but I don’t think you’re anywhere near  as Bi as I am.  You seem to like boys too  much.”<p>
  “But I care <em>so</em> much about Zhu Shu…”<p>
  “That’s perfectly natural, Rei. She’s one of your best  friends. The only difference is that you know she likes girls instead of guys.”  Akane sat back. “Listen to me. I even sound like her now.” Akane laughed. “Rei,  you know what you need? You need to talk to my sister Kasumi. She’s the  absolute best big sister in the world and I’m sure she’ll help you figure out  how you feel.”<p>
  “You don’t think she’d laugh at me?”<p>
  “No… I know she won’t laugh at you.” Akane smiled.  “And, if she helps you decide you do love Zhu Shu, and want to make her happy,  then I’ll do everything I can to help you too…”<p>
  Rei met her smile and for just one second, Akane saw  her as Zhu Shu did, the glorious angel of fire, and Akane knew that as far as  Zhu Shu was concerned, she’d never be jealous of anyone who loved her ever  again…<p>
  Outside the door, quite as her namesake, Zhu Shu  smiled before going to get the promised snacks…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Rei joined Akane and Zhu Shu on the subway ride to  Nerima, Akane having invited her to dinner, and they chatted about school and  the other Senshi and boy troubles, and the ride passed quickly. They arrived  just as Kasumi was setting out dinner, and somehow, with the unerring sense of  hers, Kasumi had made more than enough for the two extra unexpected mouths.  Everyone was overjoyed that Zhu Shu was back, especially in perfect health.  Nabiki even spent a part of the evening asking Rei if she thought it would be  fun to play Mars in the movie Tao-Ching had set up to cover up the fight. Rei  managed not to reveal that she really was Sailor Mars and did a decent job of  playing starry eyed girl who made good.<p>
  After the delicious meal, Rei and Akane followed Zhu  Shu to the family shrine, where Zhu Shu’s swords still sat in their place of  honor. Zhu Shu had the pair sit beside her after she had picked up her signet  and kissed it before hanging it around her neck again.  She closed her eyes as she prepared herself  to re-link with the ancient blades. Akane watched closely, rehearsing in her mind  the exercises Zhu Shu was doing to clear her chakra and channel her chi, before  she reached out for the smooth wooden pommels.<p>
  A spark jumped from her hands to the hafts of the  blades as a sudden surge of energy flowed through Zhu Shu. Cascades of energy  flowed down the blade, delineating them in golden light. As her palms clenched  around the hilts, the faint dragons carved on their blades flared into a light  as bright as the sun while through all of their minds came a roar of  exultation. The dragons seemed to rise above the blades and merged to form a  burning yin yang symbol before exploding into an arrow of power that arced into  Zhu Shu’s breast. She twirled the twin blades in a fiery arc before holding  them straight out before her as the energy streaming around them flared one  last time and flowed back into her body.<p>
  Zhu Shu lowered the swords slowly and took a deep  breath. She turned a weak grin at the two girls. “I think they’re happy to see  me…” </p>
