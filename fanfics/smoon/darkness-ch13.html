<h1>Darkness (part 13 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/saiyagurl.html">Saiyagurl87</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/darkness-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Serena and Rei ran to their room excitedly. They were actually going 
on a hunt, and by themselves. Serena threw the bedroom door opened to 
see a startled Amy. Rei bounced in afterwards. Amy looked at the two 
girls skeptically.

Rei and Serena opened up their dresser draw and pulled out some 
clothes. They both ran into the bathroom and closed the door shut 
behind them. Amy raised an eyebrow before she left the room to read a 
book in front of the fire place.

Serena and Rei threw off their clothes and changed into something 
else. When they were done Rei had on a dark red tight t-shirt and 
baggy blue jeans. She also had a thick leather belt and some black 
sneakers. Serena wore the same thing except she had on a silver 
t-shirt and black jeans.

The two girls looked over each other with approval. Rei leaned over 
and kissed Serena on the lips slightly before she took the bewildered 
girl by the hand and tugged her out of the bathroom.

The two ran out of the bedroom and into the kitchen. Amara and 
Michelle were the only one&#39;s present. Amara slightly raised an eyebrow 
at the girls holding hands. Rei saw the look which only made her hold 
on Serena&#39;s hand grow tighter.

&quot;Is there something that you want to tell us?&quot;, asked Amara with a 
grin. Michelle smiled at the two girls. &#39;They are so cute!&#39;, thought 
Michelle happily. Serena and Rei blushed slightly and looked 
everywhere except towards their parents.

&quot;Well you see.. um, well I...&quot;, replied Rei while fumbling over her 
words.

&quot;We fell hard for each other.&quot;, finished Serena. Rei glared at Serena 
for being blunt, but happy that she got to the point.

&quot;Well about time!&quot;, exclaimed Amara with a grin. Rei and Serena&#39;s 
blush deepened slightly at the happy looks from their parents.

&quot;Anyway, don&#39;t you have a hunt to attend?&quot;, questioned Michelle. Rei 
and Serena&#39;s face brightened up and they nodded their heads 
enthusiastically.

&quot;Well then, you better get going.&quot;, said Amara.

Serena and Rei walked out the front door not before they kissed their 
parents goodbye.

&quot;Remember an hour or we&#39;ll be coming for you!&quot;, yelled Michelle. 
Michelle watched as her babies disappeared off into the distance. 
Michelle sighed slightly as Amara draped an arm around her shoulders.

&quot;Come on! They&#39;ll be fine. We&#39;ve trained them well. What can go 
wrong?&quot;, replied Amara as she pulled her soul mate back inside.

***********

Serena and Rei walked excitedly down the street as they were going on 
a hunt together. They watched as the sun vanished out of sight and was 
replaced by the comfort of the moon and stars.

Serena could remember the times when she was little and she would go 
up on the roof with her brothers and look up at the sky for hours. For 
some reason it just made her feel complete.

Serena sighed as she thought of her brothers. She looked down at the 
necklace they gave her and smiled slightly. Serena lifted a hand and 
held onto the pendent of the necklace tightly.

Serena turned her head towards Rei when she felt an arm go around her 
waist. Serena smiled down at her lover and wrapped an arm around her 
shoulder and gave it a tight squeeze. The two girls ignored the stares 
of the passer-Byers, not really caring of what the people thought.

Serena and Rei looked around for a while not finding anything they 
wanted in particular. They wanted someone who was tough, you know who 
wouldn&#39;t go down with out a fight. Some competition.

They walked around some more until they found the perfect person. It 
was a male with long blond hair in a low ponytail. He wore black 
leather pants which was held up by a thick leather belt and a matching 
leather jacket.

Serena and Rei decided he would be a good prey and decided to follow 
him. Unbeknownst to them, that particular person was a slayer. A very 
good and dangerous slayer at that.

Serena and Rei followed the man and they were soon leaded to a 
deserted alleyway.

&quot;Man, this is going to be easier than we thought.&quot;, whispered Serena. 
Rei nodded her head in agreement. When the man was in a deserted 
alleyway, Rei and Serena walked in after him. As soon they entered the 
man was right in front of them with two stakes pointed to their 
throats.

&quot;Okay, maybe not.&quot;, remarked Serena which earned her a glare from the 
slayer. Serena chanced a glance at Rei who held fear in her eyes.

&#39;It&#39;s time to leave.&#39;, thought Serena as she took a step back. Serena 
felt something hard against her back and she fearfully turned her head 
around. Their stood another slayer with dark blue eyes and brown hair. 
He wore a blue sweat shirt with tan shorts and sneakers.

Serena gulped slightly. They were in deep trouble. They slayers 
smirked slightly down at the two little vampires, watching them 
tremble in fear.

&quot;Well well well, look what we got here. Looks like we found ourselves 
two little vamps.&quot;, sneered the man in leather.

The two men began to circle around the two vampires looking them over. 
Serena and Rei could feel a shiver run up their spines at the hungry 
looks coming from the slayers.

&quot;Looks like we&#39;re going to have some fun tonight.&quot;, replied the man in 
the sweat shirt. Then the man in leather raised his hand and struck 
Rei across the face. From the force Rei went reeling back and down 
onto the floor.

Serena went to help her, but she was grabbed by her hair from behind 
and was thrown against the wall harshly. Serena slowly sunk to the 
floor as real fear etched her heart.

She could hear Rei crying out in pain as she was kicked in the stomach 
repeatedly by the man in leather. Serena saw the other man coming 
towards her and Serena kicked him in the groin. The man sunk to his 
knees in pain.

Serena got off of the floor and tackled the man that was hurting Rei. 
Serena and the man tumbled to the floor rather violently. The two of 
the began to wrestle on the ground.

Rei let a startled gasp as the other man grabbed her from behind. One 
of his hands was around her waste as the other was over her mouth. Rei 
opened her mouth and chomped down on the man&#39;s hand drawing blood.

The man screamed out in pain an immediately dropped Rei. Rei fell to 
the floor with a thud and she scrambled to her feet. She ran towards 
Serena who was being choked. Rei ran up to the man and kicked him in 
the face and the man rolled to his side. Rei quickly helped Serena to 
her feet as the girl gasped for air.

&quot;Let&#39;s leave now.&quot;, exclaimed Rei. Serena nodded in agreement and went 
to make a run for it with Rei, but luck didn&#39;t seem to be on their 
side.

They were grabbed from behind, by the man who had his hand bitten. 
Serena and Rei struggled violently as they were being dragged back 
into the dark alleyway.

The man tossed Serena to the guy in leather as the man who had Rei 
held her down and began punching her repeatedly.

The man with Serena grabbed Serena by the throat and held her pressed 
against the wall. With his other hand he pulled out a pocket knife. He 
flicked up the blade and gave Serena a sickening look.

He brought the blade to Serena&#39;s shirt and sliced it open. With her 
chest exposed he began to carve deep imprints into her chest. Serena 
cried out in pain as blood oozed down her chest to the blade and down 
the man&#39;s hand.

The man that was punching Rei stopped punching and switched to 
kicking. He kicked everywhere he could as Rei coughed up blood and 
withered in pain. The man saw a pipe near a garbage can and walked 
over to it and picked it up.

Rei laid sprawled on the floor, bleeding in several place. She weakly 
lifted her head towards Serena&#39;s cries of pain. Reid&#146;s eyes widened in 
horror as she saw the man slice into Serena&#39;s chest without any mercy. 
Rei looked towards the footsteps and her eyes widened even more in 
fear.

The man with the pipe held the it over his head and he had an eerie 
glint in his eyes. He struck down on Rei rapidly taking in the 
pleasure of her screams.

After Serena&#39;s chest was completely covered in blood, the man dropped 
Serena to the ground. Serena fell to the floor and languidly laid on 
the floor. She had tears in her eyes as the pain overwhelmed her. She 
could hear Rei&#39;s screams of pain which brought more tears to her eyes.

Serena felt herself being lifted in the air and was tossed around the 
alley like she was nothing but a piece of trash. Each time she 
collided with the floor the louder her screams became, and the angrier 
she got. The man came towards her again with a belt in hand.

Serena whimpered as he brought the down belt to her back with all the 
strength he had. Serena could feel her skin ripping open with each 
hit. After a while the man wrapped the belt around her throat and 
lifted her weak body to her knees.

Serena immediately brought her hands towards the belt and began to 
claw at it. She looked over towards Rei who had hot tears pouring down 
her face mixing in with her sweat and blood. The man with the sweat 
shirt was beating her with a pipe and cursing and insulting her every 
chance he got.

Serena felt her eyes rolling to the back of her head. She could feel 
her anger rising and it was beginning to block out all of her senses. 
She could feel strength building into her as her eyes turned a 
blackish red color. Serena grabbed the belt and ripped it off of her 
neck.

The man now holding a broken belt looked down in surprise. He stumbled 
back in fear as Serena slowly got to her feet and gave him an insane 
twisted smile. Serena etched her way towards the man and with great 
speed, grabbed the man&#39;s arm.

The man screamed in pain as he felt every bone in his arm being 
crushed into a million pieces. Serena began to bend the arm back which 
caused the man to sink to his knees. Serena smiled at him with her 
fangs exposed.

Serena twisted the arm really fast which caused it to rip out of the 
man&#39;s socket. The man screamed in bloody murder as pain rushed through 
him and all Serena did was laugh at the man&#39;s distress. Serena threw 
the arm down and walked over to the man and grabbed each side of his 
head with her hands.

In a quick motion, you could hear the snapping of the man&#39;s neck 
throughout a ten mile radius. The man who was beating on Rei long ago 
stopped as he watched in horror of the site which was displayed before 
him.

Serena dropped the life less bloody to the floor. To add to the 
affect, she grabbed the dead man by the hair and lifted him up. She 
smiled slightly before she sunk her teeth into the man&#39;s neck and 
drunk the blood hungrily from the lifeless body.

Rei looked up and was confused as to why her tormentor had stopped his 
onslaught of blows. Her eyes widened in horror as she saw Serena and 
the way she looked from when the girl lost her temper when they were 
training 4 years ago. Serena looked at her slightly before she 
advanced towards the trembling man.

The man gripped at the pipe in his hands and when Serena was close 
enough, he swung at her head as if it were a baseball. To his 
surprise, Serena caught the pipe with ease and yanked the pipe out of 
his hands.

The man moved back and tripped over Rei&#39;s leg, causing him to collide 
harshly against the wall. His eyes widened in fear as Serena held up 
the pipe and began to bring it down . Serena struck down the pipe 
against the man&#39;s head repeatedly and didn&#39;t stop until his skull was 
completely smashed.

The body tilted over and landed next to Rei. Rei gasped slightly and 
than looked up to Serena. She saw Serena staring down at her with the 
evil looking eyes. Rei slightly cowered back when Serena calmly walked 
over to her.

Raised her arms to cover her face when Serena was next to her. Serena 
kneeled down and moved away Rei&#39;s arms gently. Rei had her eyes 
clenched tightly shut with tears running down her face. Serena reached 
over and wiped away the tears gently.

Rei slightly opened up her eyes and noticed Serena hadn&#39;t stricken 
her. Serena leaned down even more and lifted Rei&#39;s bloody body into 
her lap. Rei laid weakly against Serena as Serena brought over the 
dead body. Rei looked up at Serena in confusion as to why she was 
bringing over the body.

&quot;Drink, you need it for energy.&quot;, whispered Serena. Rei looked at the 
body with disgust, seeing his head smashed and all. Rei looked up at 
Serena and saw that the girl&#39;s eyes were still red, but they weren&#39;t 
filled with hatred. They were fill with worry.

Rei sighed slightly as Serena bent the guy&#39;s neck a little so she 
could have more room. Rei sunk her teeth into the cold flesh and 
hungrily drunk the still warm liquid.

Once she was done she looked back up at Serena and notice that her 
eye&#39;s had turned back to it&#39;s original color. Rei could feel that she 
had more strength and sighed quietly to herself. Than her eyes widened 
slightly.

&quot;Serena! We have to get home before Amara-papa and Michelle-mama show 
up.&quot;, exclaimed Rei. Serena nodded her head and lifted to her feet 
with Rei. She held back with all her might as not to cry out in pain.

Rei and Serena&#39;s body were torn and bloody and they felt weak and 
tired. All they wanted to do was go home and get some rest. Serena 
looked over Rei&#39;s body and saw the ripped clothing and blood stains. 
Serena looked down at her self and looked at the ripped shirt that 
showed her bloody chest.

Serena grabbed both sides of her shirt and held them together with one 
hand. Serena wrapped a hand around Rei as Rei did the same to Serena 
for support.

The two girls limped their way out of the alley way and onto the 
street. They walked home not caring about the looks people gave them 
or their whispers. Soon the two girls were on the front stoop of their 
home.

Serena&#39;s legs became weak causing her to collapse to her knees, 
bringing Rei down with her. Serena leaned her head on Rei&#39;s shoulder 
as Rei knocked on the door. The door swung opened to be met with the 
horror stricken expression of Hotaru.</pre>
