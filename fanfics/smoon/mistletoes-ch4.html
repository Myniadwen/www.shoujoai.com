(Minako)
&quot;Matte, Hotaru-chan!&quot; I called out as the raven-haired teenager was 
about to move up the stairs of the communication center. It had been 
a late night shift, it was supposed to a quiet night. A series of 
quiet nights until the Ascension. But no, there had to be some new 
monsters breaking that rule. Pluto had assured us that Galaxia would 
be the last battle for us until Crystal Tokyo came. As if you could 
ever trust this woman, honestly.
	We had just sent off the emergency signal, calling all the 
Senshi to the Juuban High grounds and we were on the verge of leaving 
ourselves. However, there was that strange feeling that something was 
totally wrong, would go totally wrong this night. And I could for the 
laugh of it not shake it off. We didn&#39;t really have anything to fear, 
our powers had increased again over the last two years through steady 
training and maturing bodies. The Sailorsenshi of today could have 
faced all Animamates together and would have won, that I was sure 
about. And yet, there was this nagging sensation, you know? Something 
you can&#39;t quite put your finger on that slowly crawls up and down 
your spine. Like being followed by a haunting ghost in a dark, gloomy 
mansion.
	I grabbed Hotaru&#39;s arm as she turned to look at me 
quizzically. &quot;Nani? We have to hurry, Minako-chan. The others will 
need our help.&quot; Too true, the readings were quite unsettling 
themselves. Powerful, too powerful for a random occurrence. But that 
was not entirely that agitated me so much. &quot;I just... I have a bad 
feeling about this. Promise you&#39;ll be careful and take care of 
yourself.&quot; She wanted to say something but her gaze changed from 
mildly annoyance to concern as she read my own written all over my 
face. After a long pause, she tentatively reached out to gently 
stroke my face. I shivered under her touch, we had become so close 
lately. Almost like...
	&quot;I promise,&quot; Hotaru said at last, her voice totally serious 
and her eyes mirroring her honesty. I swallowed hard, trying to come 
out with something more. My mind being totally blank in that 
department for a moment and pushed by that still present, tingly 
fear, I did not hesitate. In one swift moment I had pulled her to me 
into a crushing embrace as my lips sought out hers in one long, drawn-
out but much too short kiss.
	Then I finally let go and stepped away, moving towards the 
stairs myself, I grabbed her hand and said in a hushed 
whisper: &quot;Good.&quot;

	I blinked as sheltered beams of sunlight graced my face. A 
dream again. I didn&#39;t have this one in quiet some time. Not since... 
The confusion and morning haze began to leave me slowly and with a 
start I finally registered the small weigh draped over my body, 
almost completely covering me. A head resting in the valley between 
my breasts, comfortable and with regular breathing. Long, black hair 
spilled over my upper body... Hotaru... Again... Kuso...
	Then the rest of last night&#39;s events - or was that already 
this morning - began to follow the rest of my mind to consciousness 
and my pained expression soften into a smile that could have lit a 
Christmas Tree, no make that the whole heaven. Really, I could not 
describe the relief that swept through me at that very moment. 
Perhaps it was the still present dream in the back of my awareness or 
just the incredible night that opened so much new possibilities. 
Maybe just everything put together. But as I run my hands through the 
tangled mess of still damp, yet soft hair, I could not help the sigh 
escaping my lips and lingering there for a few moments.
	I had been so scared that day. Rightfully so. But it hadn&#39;t 
been her that had been killed. Perhaps my worry put her on guard even 
more than before. But the events still had brought a nasty scar that 
was just now beginning to heal. That night, after our friends&#39; 
slaughterers, we had cried together, holding each other and I had 
sworn myself to never let either of them go. That I would be there 
for them in every way possible.
	It had hurt when Hotaru had suddenly pulled back from the 
next day onward and more and more excluded herself not only from us 
but from interaction with the world in general. I had hoped the pre-
battle kiss to be something special and I silently had hoped that she 
would turn to me in those dreadful times. But she hadn&#39;t and that had 
hurt.
	Suddenly jolted from my reverie, I noticed that Hotaru was 
watching me. Her head just barely lifted up from its resting place, 
staring at me intently, as if trying to figure something truly 
important out. And then her face broke into a broad smile. &quot;You&#39;re 
still there.&quot; One finger found her nose and tipped it playfully, my 
response though was serious. &quot;I&#39;ll always have been there.&quot; The 
sudden mood change was... unexpected. Without warning Hotaru suddenly 
burst into a well of tears. Confused and a little agitated at this, I 
pulled her up to face level and gently rocked her while trying to 
still her tears with silent kisses. After a while the welling turned 
into tiny whimpers and I proceeded to wipe her face clean.
	&quot;Shh, it&#39;s okay. Everything&#39;s fine now, I won&#39;t go anywhere. 
I made this mistakes once but that was enough.&quot; Hotaru sniffled a few 
times. Looking up to me with those big, puffy eyes. &quot;Ai... 
Aishiteru... Gomen, demo... Aishiteru...&quot; Huh? I didn&#39;t quite follow 
that line of thought. Okay analyze that piece for piece. She loved 
me? Yay me! That was good, wonderful, brilliant. But why was she 
sorry? Sorry that she loved me?
	My expression must have been truly comical because Hotaru 
suddenly burst out laughing which only further added to my 
bewilderment. What the heck was wrong with that girl? She continued 
laughing for quite some time before finally calming down and her 
expression turning serious again. Honestly, how much emotions could 
she go through in just that short time? Especially since she usually 
was so cold? Woah...
	Hotaru slid from my body and laid next to me, her eyes 
studying me for awhile. I had turned my head to watch her as well, 
waiting for an explanation. She was not likely to give on in quite 
some time because her next question was a completely different one 
again. &quot;Seriously, where do we go from here?&quot; she asked, her hands 
lazily playing with some strands of golden hair. Enjoying the feeling 
for a moment, I did not respond right away. Where would we go from 
here? That was a good question. Of course we couldn&#39;t just throw the 
past in the wind and say: To hell with it. That would be nice, 
appreciated even, tempting. It would not work though.
	&quot;Why don&#39;t we take one step at a time and look where that 
leads us. You know that I love you, don&#39;t you?&quot; She whimpered a 
little under my intense gaze and I feared she would go through 
another emotional roller coaster. Maybe I had just overloaded the 
poor girls&#39; feelings with my declaration.
	My... lover? Girlfriend? Whatever... Hotaru managed to pull 
herself together and just favored with that tiny, cute and shy smile. 
I hadn&#39;t seen this in years. And Kami had I missed it. When that shy 
smile turned a little impish and I... gulped. I noticed vaguely that 
her hand had abandoned my hair and had slipped under the covers, 
caressing in slow, still lazy patterns my right breast. A tiny moan 
escaped my throat. &quot;I still have to repay you for the most wonderful 
night in my life.&quot; Pausing for effect and her expression almost 
pouting she asked: &quot;Or do you have to go to work?&quot;
	I growled then she lightly pinched my nipple. &quot;Oh, I think I 
should but I guess I will look for something more... adequate after 
Christmas. Just doesn&#39;t... ah... suit me anymore... You know, clean 
cuts... huhoh...&quot; I visibly struggled for control and regular speech 
pattern here. The impish Raven didn&#39;t make it any better but I really 
had to get up. I had to make a few calls and such, so that I could 
squeeze some more money out of the deal. After all I wanted to quit, 
had wanted for a long time now, and not them throwing me out. No, 
that satisfaction I would not give them.
	Under great effort I managed to sit up. Not wanting to sound 
offending or anything, I said gently: &quot;I promise you can do this 
later but I really should have to get up and...&quot; The squeal from 
suddenly being pulled back by an iron grip on my wrist and pressed 
down harshly on the mattress died from my lips as I stared up at a 
looming Hotaru. Her hair fell over her shoulders and covered her face 
like a veil. But that look I would not forget in quite some time. The 
passion, hunger and lust sparkling in that purple eyes were 
incredible but the disapproving and actually dominating gaze blazing 
with intensity made me shudder. &quot;You will go nowhere,&quot; Hotaru... 
barked. A dangerous growl rumbling from deep in her throat. The only 
thing I could manage was simply comply.

(Usagi)
The walk back home this time was uneventful. I had been... shopping. 
Yes, shopping. What? That&#39;s not important. Why I have been shopping 
of all things after the events of yesterday? I don&#39;t know. It just 
seemed... right. Necessary maybe, I had no clue actually.
	It was dark again. Not that kind of dark, I mean not in pitch 
black and late dark. Sun had just vanished behind the roofs a few 
minutes ago, still some twilight. God, how pathetic have you become, 
babbling in your head like this? Pathetic! Selfish! Useless! Whore! 
Shut up, just shut the fuck up! My hands clawed on my pants a little, 
a familiar urge once again taking control of my body, guiding my 
actions. Yes, truly pathetic you are Tskukino, truly pathetic.
	When I had woken up this morning, immense pain had shot 
through my body as I had tried to uncurl from my position. Of course 
in my haze I had totally forgotten about the clamps and the little 
chain rings attached. The searing from the breast was bad but the 
exquisite torture from the instant orgasm thundering through my body 
set off by the tiny rings hooked onto my clit was... something 
different.
	Exquisite torture? Geez, get a grip girl. Can you truly 
become even more pathetic. Wanting the pain, wanting to be punished? 
Cruel and hard just like these... these... creatures did? Did you 
really want that? Yes, I did. Really, I did. As sickening as it was, 
there was nobody else to give me that punishment I deserved, right? I 
didn&#39;t even deserve someone to give me the punishment I deserved? 
Wait, does that even make sense? Yeah, I guess it did. The pathetic 
thing was rather that I knew it was wrong, not the &quot;right&quot; way to 
deal, not the &quot;best&quot; way to... To what? Get better? How could I get 
better?
	Pathetic really. I couldn&#39;t even decide if I wanted to be 
punished or not. It was my failure that had caused them to die, 
right? It was my carelessness that had driven me into their eager 
hands, right? It was me who had kept Minako all to herself for almost 
six years, just for the pathetic reason to feel... Feeling. I wasn&#39;t 
allowed that. I didn&#39;t deserve it. So why should I care, if it was 
right or not? I shouldn&#39;t because I didn&#39;t deserve no better.
	Opening the front I was surprised to see the house dark, no 
lights on. Okaasan had said that she wanted to meet someone today and 
it could get later but not that late. Oh well. Perhaps it was better 
that way. She had kept shooting me this totally awkward glances at 
the breakfast table in a manner that I always thought the gig was up. 
But I had the clothes safely tucked away and by now burned, so it 
couldn&#39;t be them and the Ginsishou had undid the markings, so... 
Couldn&#39;t be. Right? It made me uncomfortable nonetheless. And with 
Okaasan away and Otousan still working I had the house all to myself 
to safely do... things. Shingo had long since begun living on his 
own, a good thing, I don&#39;t think I could have stood the brat now.
	I had slipped off my shoes and was just starting up the 
stairs, bag with all the little... goodies, slung over my shoulder, 
when the silence of the house was disturbed by the buzzing sound of 
the... buzzer. Lame, I know. Moving over to the door, a little 
annoyed at the interruption, I must say I was quite a bit stunned 
seeing Tomoe Hotaru on my doorstep.
	Happy! Smile! The little voice in the back of my 
consciousness screamed at me and I plastered a huge, big, hundred 
watt grin on my face. &quot;Konbanwa, Hotaru-chan! What brings you here at 
that late hour?&quot; Megami, I had to cringe at my own fake cheerful 
voice and as I saw Hotaru frown for a moment I began to believe that 
I had invoked exact the opposite reaction from what I had aimed 
for. &quot;Um...&quot; she started, tilted her head a little to the side, &quot;can 
I come in?&quot; Ack, did she have to do that? Great now she was making 
fun of me, not that I didn&#39;t deserve it.
	&quot;Sure,&quot; I chirped and cringed again when I turned around and 
headed for the kitchen. Politely as it was expected from me I asked 
her, if she wanted to have some tea. She would have liked too but 
didn&#39;t want to importune. No, really how did she figure that? If 
anything was a bother than it was me. She had said that herself, 
right? So why was she here?
	I made the tea and sat down opposite of her. That gaze 
lingering on my back while I worked on making the tea was unsettling 
and now it was even more disturbing. It felt like she could see right 
through me. Right through my very soul. She took the steaming cup and 
sipped on it for awhile, eyes still peaking over the rim, boring 
right into me.
	Then Hotaru set down the cup again, the suspicion lurking in 
her eyes never leaving those and making me look away in shame for 
some reason, but her features softened a bit. &quot;Arigato.&quot; I blinked, 
then stared. Long. Long, endless moments of... staring. Thank you? 
Did she just say... Oh, the tea of course. Pleasantries. Yes that&#39;s 
it. &quot;Domo arigato for helping me and Minako-chan. That was you, 
wasn&#39;t it?&quot; If I had drank some of the tea myself, I would have 
choked on it now and then spilled it all over the kitchen floor. My 
eyes got really wide. You know, like big saucers, like in this anime, 
right?
	My lip trembled, trying to voice something but unable 
to. &quot;How?&quot; I finally managed. Lame again, yes, but I think she 
understood. Hotaru smiled a little. &quot;You were there. I sensed you, 
briefly.&quot; Kuso. &quot;And why else should Minako have been there?&quot; Kuso. 
Kuso! Kuso... &quot;That was very kind of you Usagi-chan. I... have to 
apologize for what I said yesterday, it was uncalled for.&quot; Apologize? 
No! Not that, she could not... It wasn&#39;t... &quot;You are not pathetic, 
Usagi, you know that, right?&quot; NO! My mind screamed and that little 
voice rebelled, wrecked havoc, did a lot of nasty things. She could 
not do this. What she said was right, she couldn&#39;t take it back, I 
deserved to be punished! No, not deserve, that would make it sound 
like a good thing. I had to be punished. Yes, that&#39;s it. And she 
couldn&#39;t take it back, just couldn&#39;t...
	I manage to smile - should have been rewarded with an Oscar 
for that - I managed to nod and smile and accept the apology while 
all my senses were screaming betrayal. I told her that I was happy 
for her and Minako and that alone counted. That was the truth. Then, 
with some greater effort and gentle prying, I got her to leave, 
telling her I was tired from last night and hadn&#39;t gotten much sleep, 
which was particular true too.
	As soon as she was out of the door I slowly walked upstairs. 
Every step, every motion seemed like a small eternity and yet the 
time I actually noticed passing could hardly be five seconds. I was 
slipping into that trance again, rational thinking fleeing from my 
mind.
	A few moments later I already found myself in my room and on 
the edge of my bed. My body was giving off tiny, little shudders that 
I could not dare hope to control while a familiar war silently raged 
on in the little bit of awareness left. It was a short but intense 
battle as reason battled craving. Deep down I knew that I didn&#39;t 
truly wanted this but the voice hammering like a constant headache in 
the back of my mind was loud and strong. Too strong. Control was 
something I lacked anyway and so reason fought a losing battle right 
from the beginning. Punishment was the only option, my pain the only 
thing that was allowed. Because I deserved no better. I knew I kept 
repeating this and it sounded dull but... It was that simple, wasn&#39;t 
it?
	One hand reached out to retrieve the metal clamps from inside 
of a drawer while with the other started to rummage through my bag, 
seeking something particular. I started at the metal clamps between 
my fingers while I was searching and the rebelling voice of reason, 
that sounded an awfully lot like Serenity, was getting quieter and 
quieter with every moment until there was no reaction at all as I 
numbly pulled out the sought item.
	It was another set, similar to the others. I smiled a little, 
my dazed mind only fixated on the sweet pain that this new... toy 
would bring. The chain or better string was longer and would reach 
down nicely, it could be stretched too. Nice black leather... Cute. I 
hooked one ring at the one from the clamps and let the new 
combination brush over my still-clad body, testing the length. 
Perfect.
	I stood up and discarded my clothes in a robot-like pattern. 
All the while the little voice was getting louder and louder. Hotaru 
was wrong. She couldn&#39;t take it back, because it was true. And this 
truth belonged to me. I was pathetic, I was useless. I let my friends 
die. Sat there, watched and let them die. That could not be forgiven. 
Never ever. No. Surely I had imagined it. Hotaru hadn&#39;t been here 
altogether. And if... It didn&#39;t matter.
	Snapping the clamps on my erect nipples I did not even flinch 
at the familiar pain lanced through my body. Toying for a while with 
the chain, I finally took the attached end and guided it down to my 
clit that had not gotten any attention after this morning. Which 
meant it was not prepared at all.
	I hollered a little as the tiny ring slid into place just 
like the other was this morning. That one had tiny pins on the 
surface, like needless but plain instead of sharp. They burned 
nonetheless as they buried themselves in the extremely sensitive 
flesh. A delicious extra sensation added the other set of metal 
clamps holding my pussy lips wide open. I had fallen in love with 
that one the moment I saw it. Alongside with the other items, I was 
now ready for the punishment I des... NO! The punishment I had to 
endure. Not deserved. Never deserved. I deserved nothing. With that 
clarified I begun tucking on the chains.

(Minako)
Two steaming cups of pitch black coffee stood on the table, prepared 
for my guest. Still seated comfortably in one of the somewhat cheap 
arm chairs was the blue-haired woman who had come by earlier in the 
afternoon. It had taken me totally by surprise seeing Tsukino Ikuko 
on my doorstep and even more so when she wanted to talk to me in 
private, the confrontation had been a particular awkward one.
	I just finished making some tea and getting some cookies for 
us. Hotaru had decided to come by for sometime before she went to see 
Usagi. Kami, had I been stupid. It was actually ridiculous. I, the 
great, self-proclaimed Goddess of Love, had been played like an 
amateur. Feh, from Usagi no less. When Hotaru had pointed out that 
little, obvious fact I felt like slapping myself silly but at the 
moment just burst out laughing.
	Hotaru still hadn&#39;t explained her behavior this morning and 
while I was not one to press a personal issue, not anymore and not in 
her case, there was this nagging sensation in the back of my mind 
that whatever truth lay behind it, would have a fatal impact. And it 
scared me. Quite frankly it scared me a lot. If it had just been the 
overflow of emotions from this morning I would have understood and 
simply had filed it away as confusion and emotional trauma. But the 
reaction when I had wanted to resent her physically for perfect 
understandable reasons, that was what scared me somewhat. Of course, 
sure, it thrilled me to have Hotaru suddenly go all dominatrix on me. 
Really, it did. A small part had wanted to let control slip for 
awhile and let someone else be the dominating party. The look 
though... As if she was utterly crazed.
	Afterwards the explanation still failed to come and she 
excused herself for a hot shower. I had lain there on the bed, 
exhausted and a little numb, not really knowing what to do. She had 
said, she loved me. But was I worthy of her complete trust yet, 
probably not.
	I had let it slide when she finally came back, more relaxed 
and... normal. I didn&#39;t want to spoil the mood and the feeling that 
it was too early to approach that topic. However, when the day passed 
I grew more and more anxious. It was like I was threatened to lose 
her again, if I didn&#39;t bring her to trust me with that and may it be 
even so painful.
	Putting the tea and plate of cookies down on the table I 
prepared to sit down next to Hotaru, preparing for some careful, 
gentle probing. I hadn&#39;t been granted the time as the doorbell rang 
that exact moment. I wanted to ignore it, I really wanted to. I would 
even defer this conversation, just to spent some quality time with my 
new girlfriend. It had been too long since I did something &quot;normal&quot; 
like that. But nooo... I had to groan and accept my fate with another 
regretful sigh. Opening the door I came face to face with Tsukino 
Ikuko.
	Ah, just great! &quot;Oh, hi... Tsukino-san!&quot; What the heck? &quot;Good 
afternoon, Minako-san.&quot; Uh oh, I don&#39;t think that look bore well for 
me. Okay, divert attention, be nice. &quot;Would you like to come in?&quot; She 
simply strode past me. Passing Hotaru a calculate look before sitting 
down. I was pretty good at reading emotions and the numerous one I 
saw Tsukino-san&#39;s face go through in under a few seconds ignited a 
spark of worry in me, something was wrong here. Horribly wrong.
	Ikuko wasn&#39;t phased by my - granted pathetic - attempts on 
pleasant conversation. She just sat there, for a few moments, her 
eyes literally boring into me. I wanted to reach out for Hotaru&#39;s 
hand at some point but for some reason thought better of it. Somehow 
I had the feeling that would make things even worse. &quot;Minako,&quot; the 
elderly woman finally said sternly and I gulped under her intense 
gaze. &quot;Have you been sleeping with my daughter?&quot;
	Oh... shit! If one ever heard of horrible timing, this 
situation had just shot to the top of examples. Um, Hotaru, where are 
you going? I watched in shock as my girlfriend had stood up and was 
just excusing herself. I shot her a desperate, pleading look but she 
simply shook her head. *Something&#39;s up. I go over to Usagi and speak 
to her. Hold her up a little.* And with that she was out of the door.
	Hold her up?!? I mean I would be glad when she finally left 
my apartment. How did she expect me to actually keep her here? Me, 
all alone with that woman who looked like she was ready to commit 
brutal murder with her bare hands? No, thank you. I could very well 
do without dealing with an enraged, overly-protective mother...
	Wait a minute there! Tsukino Ikuko was nothing like that. 
When I prided myself with something more when reading emotions, it 
was my ability to judge people. Okay, that had slacked lately and I 
made some mistakes but despite that I was pretty sure that the elder 
Tsukino was not one to jump to easy conclusion or get worked up like 
that over her already old enough daughter sleeping with another 
woman. No, it just didn&#39;t fit the piercing stare I received when I 
slowly turned back to her. So what was wrong with that picture, I 
asked myself, as I mentally prepared to meet the woman&#39;s wrath and 
somehow find out what really was going on.

	After surviving the initiate rant - though I could not answer 
how -, I was shocked to say the very least how Ikuko had found about 
me and Usagi. She had been suspecting it for year&#39;s now but never 
pried, knowing how depressed Usagi was these past years. This 
morning, however, she had more or less accidentally discovered 
something that had my blood freeze for a moment and I could only 
shake my head in denial at her question if I had anything to do with 
that.
	You know how that is when you want to throw up right on the 
spot? Well, I really wanted to. The thing was actual trivial compared 
to what I had discovered in my area of work. But just envisioning 
Usagi in a position like this, sent a shudder down my spine. Usagi 
had never mentioned or shown anything in this direction. Would I have 
known... Well, I don&#39;t know what I would have done. However, learning 
this little fact right after the healing night of me and Hotaru... It 
was most... disturbing.
	I had spent several minutes assuring the distraught mother 
that I was in no way responsible. I think my own shock must have 
leaked through because the older woman eased the pressure quickly.
	Returning my thoughts back to the present, I had finished 
dialing the cell phone number of my girlfriend. &quot;Minako?&quot; Hotaru&#39;s 
voice came through the receiver and I could here the worry in her 
voice. &quot;Good that you are calling. There is something wrong with 
Usagi, I...&quot;
	&quot;I know,&quot; I interrupted with a sigh. &quot;Listen. This might be a 
little disturbing... Okay, make that very disturbing but apparently 
Usagi is on a little pain trip...&quot; Alright, poor choice of words but 
I really didn&#39;t know how to break this gently to Hotaru. Besides, she 
could take a lot. Her answer was barely a whisper to a degree where I 
could only guess the hushed &quot;Nani?&quot; Taking a deep breath I related 
the situation Ikuko had found her daughter in early this morning.
	There was a very long silence on the other end. And I mean a 
very long silence. When another barely audible, croaked &quot;Iie&quot;. I 
could almost HEAR Hotaru shaking her head. Then, more steady this 
time, she addressed me once more before immediately cutting the 
line. &quot;Keep Tsukino-san there. Under no circumstances let her come 
back.&quot;
	I stared at my cell phone for a long moment after realizing 
that the line was dead. Slowly putting it back in my pocket, I took 
the two cups of coffee that had cooled down a little by now and 
returned to the living room, the sinking feeling from this morning 
returning to me once again. Wordlessly I put the coffee down on the 
table and fell in the arm chair next to her.
	Ikuko spared me a worried glance. &quot;What is it, Minako-chan?&quot; 
I closed my eyes and rested my head back against the backrest for a 
moment before answering in a tired voice. &quot;I would like to know that 
myself.&quot;

(Hotaru)
I was back in the house - Usagi hadn&#39;t locked the door - and up the 
stairs in record time, taking two to three steps at once. Minako&#39;s 
phone call had confirmed a nagging suspicion I had during the whole, 
awkward talk with Usagi. She hadn&#39;t done much talking to be precise 
but her body language should have clued me in immediately. I had 
ignored the red warning lamps though and let her usher me out of the 
house. I had been worried, yes, but since I hadn&#39;t been able to put 
my finger on it, I didn&#39;t think I would have come back and checked, 
if Minako hadn&#39;t called. The revelation of just what was up with our 
Princess struck me like a lightning bolt and suddenly it all became 
so clear. Yet, I desperately hoped that I was wrong, that I was 
misinterpreting the information.
	I was almost at the top, when I heard a muffled scream from 
the dimly-lit room that was Usagi&#39;s. The door was slightly ajar and 
therefore the sound barrier field that was visible to my trained eyes 
rendered ineffective. Although every instinct in me screamed for me 
to hurry, I slowed down and gently nudged open the door.
	I don&#39;t think I ever forget that moment. Frozen solid, 
branded deep next to the many other memories that held a similar 
status. But... that... I had expected, feared it. Seeing it confirmed 
was worse than knowing. It always was, wasn&#39;t it?
	I stood frozen in the doorframe for several minutes, my 
internal voice urging me forward but my body denying the command. 
Just like Ikuko had relented to Minako. A little more extreme even. 
Hunched on the back, hair falling freely down her body I was still 
very much able to see the construction of clamps on breasts and 
pelvis, chained together in the middle just long enough to allow a 
simple lying position without inflicting pain.
	&quot;Usagi...&quot; I finally whispered and the reaction was instant. 
Her head suddenly snapped up and around in such a manner that I could 
have sworn it should have broken. Her eyes were wide but there was 
still the expected haze, the dullness that I knew very well would be 
there. She didn&#39;t cease the movements of her hands. One on the upper 
chain constantly pulling and the other between her legs tugging on 
the leather strip occasionally to add to the situation. She didn&#39;t 
cry though or scream or anything. Just sat there, with shudders and 
spasms rocking her body.
	&quot;Usagi...&quot; I made another step, now almost at her side. The 
blonde followed me with her eyes not really fixed on anything. Her 
posture was... humbled, humbled and ashamed. Ashamed that I caught 
her and that is why she didn&#39;t allow herself the pain to be shown, a 
part of my mind analyzed clinical, drawing from experience.
	&quot;See?&quot; she said in a squeaky voice. &quot;You were right after 
all. I am pathetic. Useless and pathetic. That&#39;s why I need to be 
punished...&quot; Reaching out with one trembling hand, I touched her arm 
briefly... Times like this were the reason why I cursed my most 
recent, latest gift. I wasn&#39;t really a seer or anything, or as 
sensitive as Rei had been, but sometimes I still good flashes - 
visions - from people or objects when touching them.
	When I brushed over Usagi&#39;s bare skin something shot forward 
with unbidden force and I tried with every ounce of power still left 
to defend myself but I couldn&#39;t. The pictures rushed before my mind&#39;s 
eye like a fast-moving train. And it felt just like being in the path 
of one too. I saw them, in the dark alley, mauling, gripping and 
torturing the innocent picture of a human soul that was my Princess. 
Them. I recognized them immediately or maybe it was Usagi&#39;s 
recognition that I felt, whatever. But no matter what there was 
suddenly a huge, neon sign in scarlet red letters being waved in 
front of me that read one word.
	FAILURE
	I recoiled with a sharp cry and jumped back, shaking, 
trembling and so many more things. My mind was racing and I was 
desperately trying to tame the maelstrom that raced through my very 
being. The best synonym I could come up with was a raging fire 
consuming a forest while a swirling tornado scourged the flames even 
higher. I could feel something crack inside of me. Something I had 
kept hidden, sheltered and controlled for so long. This morning I had 
allowed myself after a long time for the switch to be flipped from 
its neutral position of control into something more primal. And now I 
felt it again.
	But this time I didn&#39;t have any kind of control. The ringing 
in my ears from the hissing flames and the roaring tornado was only 
getting louder and louder as the safely tucked-away memory broke to 
the surface. The one, only memory, the one, only truth that I was 
reluctant to share with anyone, including Minako, and that dominated 
my life subconsciously for so long.
	I could see it all again. The sickening visage of the monster 
years ago. After the battle, somehow it had survived, then waited for 
me to return home, alone. I could feel it all again in a dull reverie 
that threatened to rip me apart right on the spot. That brutal 
tentacles - just like straight out of a cheap hentai movie - that had 
forced themselves onto me. Around my breasts, on my nipples, in my 
mouth, up my ass and in my pussy altogether, at once, without 
foreplay, without restraint.
	The images began to mingle as the vision from Usagi once 
again replayed itself and I relived some of the absolutely most 
horrible moments of my life. I could literally feel that whip on 
Usagi&#39;s center while mine was brutally ripped apart with a sharp, 
blade-like tentacle ending rammed right through. If Saturn hadn&#39;t 
detached her spirit from my body before I passed out and put me back 
together right afterwards I would have not survived it. It took me a 
month to regain steady walking again...
	I ran, my body finally reacted to the trauma and decided to 
turn tail and run, run as far away as possible. Somewhere where it, 
where I hadn&#39;t have to deal with that, where control could be 
regained.
	&quot;NO!&quot; I visibly jerked back from the forceful pull on my 
wrist and before I knew I was spun around and amazingly found myself 
face to face with a sitting - despite the clamps - Usagi drawing me 
into a harsh kiss. Another shudder run down my spine and I felt the 
switch somewhere deep in my mind moving, ignoring the tight control I 
had pulled on it for years. Yesterday night and this morning I had 
flipped it myself but somewhat controlled and well aware of what I 
was doing. Now, I wasn&#39;t so sure that I could.
	Deciding that taking matters into my own hands was better 
than letting the control slip, I used just a little more force than 
necessary to push Usagi away which immediately sent her on her back 
again, the chained clamps surely inflecting another jolt of pain but 
Usagi only whimpered and looked up at me. Her eyes did not mirror 
dominance or hunger but... humility and submission. An abashed look 
that was definitely sheepish and pleading. Like a small child that 
had been caught stealing a cookie...
	If only it would be that easy. I knew what she was going 
through, every bit of it. And I also knew that there was only one 
person in this world... yes, in existence probably, that understood 
her. Me. And damn it I could not deny that I felt responsible, could 
not run away from it, not again, not anymore. I desperately hoped 
that Minako would understand. I had been afraid it would come to this 
but... No! It was better that way. If both of them would hate me 
later, I would at least have the knowledge that I did everything I 
could. They probably both would hate me afterwards. I could not help 
that though. Usagi would not go through the same trauma I had been. I 
hadn&#39;t had anyone this time around but Usagi did now. Me.
	When her plea finally left her mouth, I had already flicked 
that switch and let myself completely go. Nothing else would 
help. &quot;Onegai, Hotaru, I didn&#39;t mean to...&quot; My hand struck her hard 
over her already lightly swollen clit and elicited a shrill cry of 
pain from Usagi. I struck again, this time with a clear bark of 
order. &quot;Silence!&quot; Usagi only whimpered and kept her eyes downcast but 
didn&#39;t make a sound.
	I noticed the bag next to her and set to work.

(Usagi)
No, no, I said I was sorry. I had no right to make you remember... 
remember this horrible, ugly, WRONG... thing... No, no please! Ah! 
That hurt. Pain! Pain is good. I deserve pain. No, no, not deserve, I 
had to get this sorted out. I didn&#39;t deserve anything. You can do 
everything you want to me. I am nothing. I need to be punished. I 
made you remember. Oh sweet pain. That one hit perfectly. Good thing 
mother wasn&#39;t home yet or... Ah! Again! Silence? Huh? Okay, I&#39;ll be 
quiet. Have I been bad again? Yes, I am not allowed to scream. Good 
girls didn&#39;t scream but I am a bad girl... aren&#39;t I?
	She looked at me, leering, smacked her lips with her tongue 
for a moment. There was that glint in her eyes, was she? What about 
Minako? No, I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t destroy that too, not that too. I made 
it, I helped, I didn&#39;t want to... Where was she going? No, don&#39;t 
leave me... or... Yes! Yes, leave me, leave me all alone and go back 
to her. It&#39;s better that way. She&#39;ll be alright, I didn&#39;t need to be 
alright. How could I ever have thought what happened to me was bad? 
It was nothing. Nothing compared to her pain. I envied her for her 
strength, her control. Neither of us suspected. Another reason why 
I&#39;m a pathetic, useless whore.
	Huh? She was still there. The door was closed I noticed. How? 
Don&#39;t ask me. I just knew. She was stalking slowly towards me. I lay 
there, unmoving, not daring to speak or make a sound. Her movements 
were confident, like a big and strong predator and the way she looked 
at me. Oh yes, that&#39;s right! I am nothing! NOTHING! In her eyes I 
didn&#39;t have any rights, belong to... her? Yeah, I suppose, I do. To 
them actually. They could ask me to kill myself right now and I would 
do it. That gaze is so intense, so powerful.
	She... Mistress was sitting down on the edge of the bed, 
totally ignoring me, grabbed my bag though. With all the little 
goodies. Oh! Will she use them? Will she punish me with them? I 
didn&#39;t deserve it but I wanted her too. I wanted her to because I 
didn&#39;t deserve it... otherwise. Mistress had something pulled out. Oh 
that, yes that! Please, Mistress! I staid silent though, I knew I was 
not allowed to speak and far from it... request. No, bad girl.
	Mistress put the pretty whip aside. No! But... she didn&#39;t put 
it away, so maybe later? Her hand vanished into the bag again and my 
eyes sparkled a little, just a little. I think she noticed but didn&#39;t 
say anything. The leather straps! With four of them in her hands she 
put the bag aside - but in reachable distance - and turned around. A 
chill ran down my spine as she leveled this gaze at me again and I 
looked down... or as much as you can look down when you were already 
lying. The next thing I knew my wrists were wrapped in the straps and 
those bound to the bedpost. Then the same with my ankles. My body 
screamed when Mistress pulled my legs wider apart than necessary but 
I ignored the urge to snap them back together, not making a sound. 
Really, I did, I tried. But I could not prevent the sob when the 
clamps on my inner lips were pulled apart further which set off a 
small chain reaction. Just as I wanted it... but I couldn&#39;t have done 
that by myself. Wouldn&#39;t have...
	I muffled another shrilling screech when Mistress tucked on 
the chain at my unwanted response and sent another fizzling of small 
flames through my body. Then, before the sensation had totally 
finished she jammed to fingers in my center and twists the ring 
around my pleasure spot, scratching a fingernail over it. I couldn&#39;t 
help it, I practically shot from the bed... Except the bindings were 
holding me down and since every movement caused the combination of 
rings to move it didn&#39;t help.
	Mistress left me hanging there for awhile. Didn&#39;t say, didn&#39;t 
do anything. Just watched as my body squirmed and shuddered from my 
self-inflicted torment. She liked it! The pain was so intense, just 
from a little stimulating, wow! I could have never done that alone! 
Maybe that&#39;s why she was here and doing... this. Maybe, I even 
could... could... No, I couldn&#39;t be free afterwards. I never would 
be. I needed punishment, much more punishment. To pay for all the 
things I had done... or not done. Depends on the way you look at it.
	I... OH GOD! Another piercing scream ripped out of my throat 
when the whip struck with an audile crack. The small steel lining on 
the head - actually like a thin cloth wrapped around the leather - 
striking right down between my wide open legs with a force I was 
surprised it didn&#39;t break through the skin. I looked up through heavy 
eyelids, brows drawn together as colorful spots began to dance in 
front of my eyes.
	Mistress was leaning forward a little, her hands reaching out 
to touch my breasts. Oh, she was wearing the black leather gloves 
with the tiny... spikes on the fingertips and... Ah! I pressed my 
eyes tightly shut as the glove struck. It was a light slap actually 
but the spikes - or tiny nails maybe - pierced through the sensitive 
skin. Not enough to really break but enough to leave marks. She 
racked them over my breasts for awhile and I can just whimper and cry 
out occasionally, which of course only makes her dig harder. Then 
taking my nipples - clamps still firmly attached - between her 
gloved, spiked fingers, she pulled forcefully, making me holler at 
the lance of electricity driven right through my body... Pain, so 
much... Hurt, can&#39;t control anymore. I screamed louder as Mistress&#39; 
increases her sweet torture of my breasts. I didn&#39;t believe I could 
take it any longer but I did, somehow I managed to quiet down again.
	CRACK! I think I lost it there for a moment when the whip 
came down hard, VERY hard, on my left breast, striking with the steel 
right on the exposed and already cruelly twisted nipple. The sting 
was unlike anything I&#39;ve EVER felt. Even &quot;they&quot; had not managed such 
a reaction. For a moment - or was it a small eternity? - the burning 
sensation simply became too much and ripped my consciousness right 
from my body. Is your consciousness in your body anyway? Or is it in 
your soul?
	Just when I had returned, with a great effort, Mistress&#39; whip 
crashed down again, the other breast this time. Even harder... If 
that was possible. The backlash washed away almost all remaining 
parts of my awareness and as Mistress&#39; delivered about a dozen 
strikes each to my swollen breasts I was blissfully rooted right into 
this other realm. A realm where nothing else existed but the pain. 
The sweet pain, the needed pain. It embraced me, held me tight and 
hurt... I felt everything though. While my awareness was chained 
here, I felt every str&Atilde;&shy;ke, every ministration on my body and the 
white world of pain reflected it back to me a hundredfold. So much 
pain. So much sweet, stinging, stabbing, blistering... DESERVED pain! 
Yes, I deserved it, every bit of it, needed... craved it! I LOVED the 
pain!
	Was I insane? Huh me? Yes, I guess, I was. Numb with grief... 
pain, my mind only filled with that one word, that one wonderful 
sensation. Filling me, marking my existence, my only mean for 
existence, rushing through my veins like a drug. No that was better 
than any drug that was... that was...
	TOO MUCH! It had been just one strike, a switch I had 
anticipated, wanted, craved... The steel lining hit home again, 
Mistress was good with it, but somehow, I couldn&#39;t hold it any 
longer. Slowly the pain became too much as Mistress merciless 
released strike after strike on my weeping pussy, cruelly, somehow 
leaving me on the verge of release but never bringing me there. Which 
made me wanting more of it, anything to set me off and release the by 
now tight ball of... energy? Strange.
	It was too much. I couldn&#39;t take in any longer. I couldn&#39;t! 
My limits were reached. I couldn&#39;t endure the pain any longer. I 
tried to squash it, tell myself that I needed this, that Mistress was 
well within her right, that I had no right to object... But this 
time, this time the demanding voice was slowly losing to the other... 
different voice. Not the one that was telling me to stop this madness 
and deal with it properly. No, that was still meek and most of the 
time silent. It wouldn&#39;t have won, even if I wanted it to. There was 
something else. A rumbling sensation like approaching thunder that 
went along with the small thunderclaps that each blow... ignited...
	And I begged. I cried in earnest, wept. &quot;Stop... onegai...&quot; I 
repeated it aloud, only a whisper, more I didn&#39;t manage, and chanted 
it inside my pain-crazed mind. Please... stop... can&#39;t take... 
more... Mistress never heard me or ignored me or... whatever... 
but... As she altered again from strikes to my breasts - had she been 
where again? - to my boiling clit that by now felt like a lava pit 
inside my body, the rumbling got closer... closer... closer to the 
surface. I didn&#39;t think I could hold it any longer...

(Hotaru)
She was a writhing bundle of nerves beyond my ministrations and I 
felt myself slip deeper and deeper into the darker side of my 
character that had been born this particular day. Yes, that was 
right. It had been born. Some would suspect that leaning would 
originate from Saturn but that was unfair and cruel towards my alter 
ego. Saturn was the least to be blamed. She had held me stable, 
helped me to regain control, saved my life. And believe me when I 
said, the following years when I was all alone in my room I had often 
asked myself: Why? Why didn&#39;t she just let me die? I would have been 
brought in a new reborn cycle, right? Wouldn&#39;t that have been easier? 
Perhaps it did have something to do with the fact that I had been 
violated - by evil too. Perhaps she just wanted to save me. I still 
really hadn&#39;t found an answer.
	No, Saturn definitely was not to blame for the hideous 
display of violence I was able to bring down on my own, cherished 
Princess. But I suppose, that maybe... most likely it was a Senshi 
thingy after all. I knew how it was. I remembered as if it had been 
yesterday... or just a few hours ago. Brought back by the fresh wound 
that seeing Usagi being raped had torn up again, I knew perfectly how 
it had been. Still was. Would never go away. No.
	The struggle of the mind. Reason against shame. I think that 
was a basic thing with rape victims. Not that I could relate in that 
area from previous experience but I had watched shows and read 
magazines, you know. Only that, with a Senshi, it expressed itself in 
an extreme reaction. Reason was thrown into the wind right away and 
would only become warped into a tight lever of control. Shame was the 
most basic emotion uttered in the general tendency for punishment. 
Both ways. First would come the craving for own pain, for repeatedly 
lowering your undeserved life. Then came the hunger. Suddenly, on 
some point you snapped. From there it became a roller coaster between 
submissive and dominant.
	It had been this way with me and from what I was witnessing 
the exact same thing was happening to Usagi now. That&#39;s why I was 
here. That&#39;s why I was doing this and not only risking losing her 
trust forever but smashing that little spark of love between Minako 
and myself. If she hated me afterwards, I couldn&#39;t help it but I had 
to do this. Because no one else could.
	I watched in amusement as the little &quot;slave&quot; - I couldn&#39;t 
help but slip in this mindset - squirmed and wriggled underneath me 
when I continued to lavish fast strikes upon her angry red pussy and 
visible clit. Each one hit a new spot, be it only an inch further to 
the right. Always a new one. Her whimpers and finally uncontrollable 
screams were music in my ears... Damn it, Hotaru, stay focused! 
Control!
	The plan was rather simple. It had sprung to my mind the 
minute I began to realize that I wouldn&#39;t be able to resist the sweet 
coaxing of my inner voice that craved to deal out the pain for once, 
not be submissive or restrained all the while. It wanted to come out 
and... &quot;play&quot;. It always did. When you opened yourself up like that, 
let the control slip for only one experience of either happiness or 
sadness, it would break through. Even if I was successful and managed 
to spare Usagi a lot of the emotional trauma I had gone through, it 
would always be there. Lurking, waiting and suddenly rushing forward.
	That voice, that part of myself had been thrilled, delighted 
even by Usagi&#39;s little collection. It was easy to sort out her 
fixation on anything leather or metal. I had never had anything to 
letch onto as an initiator but I could understand the choice 
immediately. And so I knew exactly what she needed. As grotesque as 
it was the rather detailed vision had been helpful.
	I altered to her breasts once again which looked by now as if 
something had clawed at them, trying to rip the delicious flesh right 
off. There were swellings, marks and a mixture of red and blue blurbs 
all over them. I did not decrease the intensity of each strike 
though. Her eyes were pressed shut and I could feel that she was 
close. Switching to the other breast again, I drew back a little bit 
extra hard and was rewarded with a loud sob and angry, hot tears 
glistering in her eyes the soft whispers became screeched pleas for 
mercy. Perfect. I had her almost there. Almost.
	&quot;Yes squeak, slave! It will bring you nothing!&quot; I barked, 
deciding to add a little verbal assault to the ordeal, while catching 
Usagi under her chin with the tip of the whip when I drew it back. 
Another slap resounded through the room - gladly not through the 
sound barrier - as I slammed it down again, this time across both 
breasts in one strike. &quot;You are nothing! Do you hear me? Pathetic, 
begging like a small child! I thought you wanted that!&quot; Slowly 
drawing the whip back over both breasts, making sure to brush over 
each scarlet nipple, I mentally prepared myself for the finishing 
touch. I could literally feel it bubbling right under the surface, 
ready to explode upwards but still lacking the proper initiator.
	I carefully bent back for another dozen strikes. Letting the 
last bit of control slip from my movements, I simply stayed focused 
on the goal. When the previous hits had been brutal, the next ones 
were enough to draw the first thin line of internal blood to mix with 
the dripping white salvia.
	I had maneuvered completely between her spread legs now to 
get the best leverage and to spread them even further apart with my 
own knees. My eyes fixed on hers, they were glazed over which told me 
clearly that Usagi&#39;s consciousness had detached itself somewhat. That 
was good. Because only there I could reach it in the right manner.
	Her screams turned into one long screech of begging while the 
rest of the last dozen strokes followed the first one. Each 
increasing in power and speed just a little. All aimed for one spot 
this time. All in the same place. Right on her by now horribly 
distorted pleasure/pain center. A small part of me wondered briefly, 
if I wasn&#39;t going a bit overboard here and permanently damaging her 
beyond even what the Ginsishou could heal but...
	No! It had taken me weeks, MONTHS to get out of this state. I 
never had someone to help me through. I couldn&#39;t let anyone help 
because they would not have understood, could not have helped 
probably. But I could. Now I could. &quot;You are a horrible wimp, you 
know that? You whiny, spoiled brat!&quot; I bellowed over her shrill voice 
as the last stroke hit home. I doubt she could hear me. Listen maybe, 
but not hear, not really understand, grasp my words. Now, how to do 
that? How to properly put the finish on this and flip that switch 
inside her mind? This was the essential part, the really important 
part. Everything else would have been done in vain, if I didn&#39;t come 
up with exactly the right method...
	For one terrible, long moment I had frozen up as my mind drew 
a blank and Usagi&#39;s scream still echoed in my ears despite the short 
cease in strikes. Then the idea literally jumped me. Really. It is 
said that words would oven cause more pain than actions. Let&#39;s prove 
that theory, shall we?
	Reacting on instinct alone, I leaned in closer to her left 
ear while my right hand turned the whip around, blank hilt pointed 
forward. In a deathly quiet, yet still husky whisper, I breathed in 
her ear, right before ramming the hilt into her opening, drilling it 
deep into her flesh, an inch away from breaking her internal 
walls: &quot;You know, even your precious little daughter didn&#39;t whine 
that much when I took her virginity in both her tiny holes with 
fucking, little sticks. Was quite adorable actually how she squirmed, 
I forgot to snap a picture.&quot;
	Kami. Overdone much? But it did the trick. It really did. I 
was quite sure I had went a little overboard there with that last 
comment but quite frankly it was supposed to be. The reaction was 
remarkably instant. Just finally granted that craved release in one 
of the most violent ways possible, still riding that volcanic 
eruption that surely was the closest it came to describing that 
orgasmic pain explosion, who would have thought that the words even 
got through to her?
	I had expected it. Worked towards it after all for the whole 
time. However, I still couldn&#39;t prevent the gasp when Usagi - still 
on the subsiding waves of her release - had ripped her hands and 
knees free from the bindings and turned me around with a combination 
of force, speed and rough pressure that were simply supernatural. 
After that ordeal, that endurance of punishment that would have sent 
the strongest and bravest soldier on Earth into unconsciousness a 
long time ago, she was now looming over me with an actually visible 
aura of hot white fire all around her, the Ginsishou magic responding 
to its owner&#39;s call in a completely different manner.
	She looked like an angel. The very Angel of Vengeance. I 
trembled under that gaze, knowing very well what was to come, feeling 
the actual heat as she towered over me, her palms pressing into the 
flesh of my breasts under the layer of leather with unbidden force. I 
did not say anything, did not talk, did not whimper. Just stared up 
at her, knowing, also hoping for a tiny bit that she knew that my 
words had been a lie. A horrible, twisted lie that invoked a maximum 
of hate. But somehow in the back of her mind she knew that it had 
been a lie.
	I followed her hand as she reached down to remove the whip 
that was still stuck between her lower lips, not even flinching once, 
and in the process removed the clamps and ring from there and from 
her breasts too. For a moment she stared at the whip, then back at me 
and finally threw it aside. Her hand reached for the bag and drew a 
different one. One that had the steel-lining all over the leather and 
the end was spiked, just like the gloves. I gulped, a little 
nervously. Just a little.
	Quickly catching myself I met her intense, challenging gaze 
with one of my own. I would let her play dominant for a little while 
but I would not cave. I would meet her with an equal force. And thus 
the battle of wills had begun...

A/N: Are you still there? Disturbed now already? Yes? Good. I really 
don&#39;t blame you, if you are turning around and running screaming 
through the house. I really wouldn&#39;t blame you.
