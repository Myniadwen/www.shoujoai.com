<h1>Makoto's Angel (part 6 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jwelch.html">Jessica Welch</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/makang-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>It had been four weeks since Makoto received the injury from the youma.
Since then, Minako had taken every available opportunity to do things
with Makoto. The went to the arcade, the movies, the mall, even to a
concert at the park. Sometimes the other senshi were with them, other
times they were just alone. If Makoto thought it was strange she didn&#39;t
comment on it or even show any type of emotion about it one way or the
other. She was completely neutral. And that was the thing that was
grating on Minako&#39;s nerves the most.

She had practically been throwing herself at Makoto and still she
carried this attitude of detachment. Minako felt like she was banging
her head against a cement wall. She couldn&#39;t get angry though. She knew
Makoto must be afraid of something to have such a thick defense around
her heart that she couldn&#39;t see what was obvious.

Well, at least Minako thought she was being obvious enough. She figured
doing anything more would just be an announcement to the world that she
had a very big thing for her tall friend and she didn&#39;t quite want to
be that open yet. Minako had bouts of doubt every so often. She thought
she could have read too much into things. But then her rational mind
would kick in and it would be as plain as day that Makoto loved her.
You just had to be looking for the signs. Really looking.

Minako decided she would do the something similar to what Makoto had
been doing. Subtly was the key to this. One would definitely have to
know what they were searching for to see the suggestions Minako was
making towards Makoto. On the surface they just looked to be very close
friends.

Minako sat on her bed thinking about this, wondering how much longer it
would take for Makoto to clue in. &#39;You&#39;d think that she would be
looking for these clues that I like her in return. I mean, I like her
and I look for them for reassurance when I need it. And they are there.
It&#39;s like, she believes I could never be like that. Oh Mako-chan
sometimes I really want to smack you on the forehead and tell you to
open your eyes.&#39; Sighing she laid back on her pillow and stared at the
ceiling. &#39;But then again there must be a reason she&#39;s not letting
herself see what&#39;s right under her nose. What could have happened to
make her guard her heart so much to not even have hope for love? Cause
that&#39;s the only thing it could be. Makoto&#39;s always so brave and strong.
Why isn&#39;t she like that with this? All I have are questions with no
answers. I might be in the nut house before I get any too. Why do you
have to be so difficult Makoto Kino.&#39; Minako closed her eyes and let
out an exasperated sigh.

She let her mind drift to the time they spent together recently. It
wasn&#39;t where the went that mattered really, it was just being with her
that was so great. A smile tugged at the corner of her lips as she
thought back to the concert in the park. Rei, Amy, and Usagi came with
them that evening. All you had to bring was a blanket and sit in the
grass the orchestra provided the rest. Rei and Makoto brought their
sleeping bags and spread them out on the grass near the back of the
crowd. There was nothing to see really and Ami wasn&#39;t inclined to being
surrounded by a mass of people.

Makoto sat on the outside with Minako beside her. Usagi was in the
middle next to Ami and Rei sat at the other end next to her. It was
kind of cramped but Minako didn&#39;t mind that at all.. it gave her chance
to be really close to Makoto. The taller girl had stretched her long
legs out in front of her and leaned back on her elbows. Makoto had one
knee drawn up with her arm wrapped around it. The other leg was
stretched out in front of her and her corresponding arm was supporting
her weight behind her. Her hand was a breath away from Makoto&#39;s. All
she had to do was turn it sideways and it would be covering her
friends. Usagi was sitting indian style, Ami had her legs tucked under
herself and Rei sat with her knees up with her hands supporting her
weight behind her. It would have been a perfect group picture.

The concert was wonderful. The girls whispered to each other every so
often, though Minako and Makoto were speaking the most. Minako would
turn back to her and smile, whispering something about how the music
moved her. &quot;This part is so passionate but soft at the same time. How
does the composer know how to make a person feel like that with
instruments and notes?&quot;

&quot;I guess you just imagine yourself as the music and try to express
yourself through the notes. Its like any art form.&quot; Makoto replied.

&quot;Like when you skate? You capture the same emotion when you&#39;re skating
for yourself. Its beautiful.&quot; Minako said in all seriousness.

&quot;Oh you noticed huh?&quot; Makoto chuckled. &quot;I don&#39;t see how you could have
with all the boys flocking around you. I think you&#39;re just trying to be
nice to me again,&quot; she said blowing off the comment.

&quot;No, seriously... I could never do anything like that. That&#39;s why I
appreciate art and beauty whenever I encounter it.&quot; Minako was staring
at a spot where the sleeping bag showed through Makoto&#39;s fingers.

&quot;Oh that&#39;s not true Mina-chan.&quot;

&quot;Well then name off something I do that can inspire people and invoke
emotion like this music does.&quot; Minako said and began tracing around the
contour of Makoto&#39;s hand with her finger.

&quot;Umm... you just... I mean... you...&quot; she stammered and a blush burned
across her cheeks. &quot;Just take my word for it...&quot; She was now looking
down at her hand and how close Minako&#39;s finger was to tracing her skin
instead of just around it. She was lost in thought for a few moments, a
longing look had slipped into her eyes. Minako tapped her hand bringing
her back from dreamworld and stared questioningly at her.

Minako came back to the reality of her bedroom. She had a pretty good
idea where Makoto&#39;s thoughts had gone that day. That dreamy look in her
eyes and the blush gracing her features hinted as much. The stammering
proved she was trying to hide something.

&quot;You know Mako-chan, one of these days I&#39;m just going to loose all my
patience and do something drastic,&quot; Minako said to her ceiling. &quot;And
then-&quot; she was interrupted by the phone ringing. She looked at the
clock as she sprang out of bed. It was just past four in the afternoon.
As she ran into the hall she screamed, &quot;I&#39;ll Get It!&quot; to anyone in the
house who might take it. They all knew it would be for Minako so no one
had moved. She reached the phone just before the third ring. &quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; it was Makoto&#39;s voice on the other end. &quot;I was wondering if you
could come out with me to the park tonight. I think its about time we
had a talk.&quot;

Minako&#39;s face looked like it was about ready to burst with joy. &quot;Yes,
sure, no problem. When do you want me there, where are we going to
meet.&quot;

Makoto laughed, &quot;Calm down, I was just going to tell you that. We&#39;ll me
at the swing set at eight. You sure your parents are cool with that? It
is kinda late and I don&#39;t want to get you in trouble.&quot;

&quot;Oh they will be, if not I&#39;ll make them.&quot; Minako said. &#39;Wouldn&#39;t miss
this date for anything,&#39; she thought to herself.

&quot;Ok, see ya then.&quot;

&quot;Bye.&quot; Minako put the phone back in the cradle. She dashed back into
her room and started looking for something to wear though she knew she
had four hours to get ready. She had the biggest smile ever plastered
on her face. Finally Makoto had opened her eyes.

* * * * *

Makoto was sitting on one of the swings waiting patiently for Minako.
Minako wasn&#39;t exactly late, it was just that Makoto was incredibly
early. She looked at her watch again and it read 7:56. She was wearing
some dark blue jeans and a gray t-shirt. Her baseball cap was pulled
low so the brim was just above her eyes. She was holding an object in
one hand behind her back.

She looked up as she heard footsteps. Smiling she saw Minako come into
view wearing a pair of blue capris and a light yellow spaghetti strap
tank top. She looked great as usual. Makoto let herself drink in the
beauty that was Minako. This was how she inspired people, just being
herself. Her movements were so elegant that when she moved it reminded
Makoto of someone dancing.

&quot;I&#39;m here,&quot; Minako said waving and smiling as she walked up to the
swings. &quot;So what&#39;s up?&quot;

&quot;Hi,&quot; Makoto was smiling but her eyes were serious. She reached out and
grabbed the chain of the swing beside her and pulled it towards Minako.
&quot;Have a seat.&quot;

Minako sat noticing her friend was holding something in her other hand
behind her back. She tried to control the knowing look in her eye and
the smile that wanted to beam from her face. The necklace was supposed
to be a surprise and she wanted to keep it that way. &quot;Ok I&#39;m sitting.
Now what&#39;s up.&quot;

&quot;Well, I wanted to bring you here and talk, cause... umm... this is
where everything happened... and... yeah.&quot;

Minako smiled thinking back to the day when she flew off the swing and
tackled her. Her smiled faded a bit thinking of the day after that. But
it returned when she thought about their trip to the mall. &quot;Yeah I
guess it did happen here didn&#39;t it.&quot;

&quot;Well I think it&#39;s time we talked about it Mina-chan. Because, I mean,
all this acting...&quot; she paused trying to find the words. &quot;I just don&#39;t
... I mean I think... man... I want us to talk about it so it can ...
so it can stop.&quot;

&quot;Ok, so how exactly did you want to talk about it?&quot; Minako thought it
best if Makoto said what she had to say first. It would be easier then
and it seemed right.

&quot;Mina-chan... I just want you to be happy. You know that,&quot; she looked
up and her emerald eyes sparkled with love and sincerity. Minako nodded
holding her gaze. Makoto began drowning in the deep blue pools. &#39;Oh
Mina-chan, why do you have to make this so hard for me. But you don&#39;t
even know what you&#39;re doing to me so I can&#39;t blame you.&#39; Makoto thought
to herself.

Minako could sense the courage that the brunette was trying to build.
She knew the confession would be the next words to cross her lips. Oh
how she longed to hear those words.

&quot;Minako...&quot; her voice was slightly shaky.

The blonde&#39;s heart pounded faster, her eyes closed as she waited for
those three little words to wash over her. She heard the soft husky
voice speak her name again and she knew now was the moment.

&quot;Minako... I...&quot; Makoto stammered a bit. The look on Minako&#39;s face was
so indescribable, making her that much more beautiful and making it
that much more harder for Makoto to speak. Taking a breath and inhaling
the soft perfume that she wore had her almost in a daze. But she had to
say it, she had to finish. She closed her eyes and finally spoke the
words.

&quot;Minako, I think its time you get past this guilt and move on with your
life.&quot;
