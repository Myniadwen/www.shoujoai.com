<p align="center">-Interlude III-</p>
<p>It was a cold morning in early  February, the sky was cloudy and a northeasterly breeze swept through  Tokyo, carrying with it the ocean chill. Haruka yawned as she put on  her heavy sweat shirt over a white tee-shirt and slipped on her  sweatpants over her thermal leggings. She put on a yellow knit hat,  tied on her running sneakers, and left out the front door of her  student dorm. After a series of warm-up stretches, she set out.</p>
<p>The  sky was just beginning to turn a pinkish hue, the sun not yet visible  over the trees and buildings surrounding the high school campus as she  jogged around the track behind the school. She'd had another dream  again, the one about the end of the world. This time though, she saw  the girl clearly. She wore a sort of sailor inspired costume, had long  wavy aquamarine hair, wore a tiara, and had piercing deep blue eyes.  She whispered of fate, past lives and other things that made sense at  the time but now that she was awake were either half-forgotten or  simply left her baffled.</p>
<p>Haruka left the track and began to run  cross country through the manicured grass lawn of the school and out  towards the public park that lay adjacent. She realized that she was  running away again, but she wasn't quite sure yet from what. She'd been  accepted into Mugan, and would begin there next year. Her parents had  formally cut her off after she'd come out to them, but her late aunt's  inheritance would be enough to at least see her through to high school  graduation. But her dreams...</p>
<p>Her dreams frightened her. They  hinted at a destiny, at something monumental that was coming and that  she was to be a part of. Her and the girl from her dreams. Haruka  already had a dream though. She wanted to be a formula one racer. It  was all she'd ever dreamed of since she was a young girl sitting up on  the big couch in the living room next to her father watching motor  sports up on TV. She wasn't about to give her hopes and dreams up, not  for some silly recurring dream that probably meant nothing.</p>
<p>But then, if it meant nothing, why was she so pensive about the whole thing?</p>
<p>She  jogged through the park and out into a residential district, her breath  rising up in white whiffs in the cool of the February morning. Already  the snow was melting in places, and as she ran she thought of the  season's first track meets at the end of next month. As she began to  run down the sidewalk past the houses that lined the street, she noted  something unusual. Up until now, the only sounds she'd been aware of  were of her feet striking the ground and her steady breathing. But now,  a third sound had joined in.</p>
<p>The sound of wind rustling.</p>
<p>She  looked around. The trees were motionless, and the flag draped up in  front of one of the local grammar schools hung limply from the pole.  Yet still, as she continued on past the two story house across the  street, she couldn't shake the sound of the wind billowing.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>The  small girl opened her eyes slowly. The sun was just beginning to rise  up over the horizon. She loved to watch the sunrise, the way the colors  danced and splashed across the park and houses. She sat up too quickly  however, and went into a coughing fit. The frail girl reached over to  her nightstand for her inhaler, taking two quick puffs before she was  able to catch her breath.</p>
<p>She didn't used to be this way. She  used to be a spunky and sprightly little girl, always full of laughter  and mischief. Her earliest memories were of her mother cooking apple  pies in the Fall, the intoxicating scent sending the girl into ecstasy  in anticipation. She could remember sneaking a taste, and how her  mother chided her for it, only to then console her as the overly  sensitive girl began to cry.</p>
<p>She had faint memories of her father  from that early time. Sitting at the breakfast table drinking coffee  and reading his paper, or kissing her goodnight along with her mother.  Mostly though she could remember he was always leaving, whether it was  to go to his laboratory in the basement or to his job as a professor at  the college he worked at.</p>
<p>She was happy then. She was healthy and loved then too.</p>
<p>Then,  when she was five, the incident happened. An explosion in her father's  lab took away her health and her mother's life, as well as all the  happy times she'd once known.</p>
<p>Slowly, cautiously, she got out of  her bed, the mattress and much of the rest of her room covered with  stuffed toy animals. She put on her dark purple bathrobe, slipped on a  pair of slippers, and brought her inhaler with her just in case. She  wanted to see the sunrise up close, to remember that not everything was  dark and somber. She walked to the window and looked out, resting the  palm of her hand on the glass.</p>
<p>The corners of her lips slowly  curved upward as she saw the way the sun cast gold and magenta  highlights on the large tree just outside her window. As she looked out  further, she could see a jogger running along the sidewalk. From the  long distance she had no way of knowing if it was a boy or girl, but  whoever it was, they were obviously quite fit to be able to keep up  with the pace they were running at. The girl was fixated on the jogger,  imagining what it must be like to be so healthy and energetic. She  didn't hear the door to her bedroom open or the soft footsteps coming  up behind her as she continued to look out. It wasn't until she saw the  reflection in the window that she was alerted to the other's presence.</p>
<p>&quot;You'd like to be out there too, wouldn't you?&quot; Kaolinite asked with a sneer, &quot;To run and enjoy the outdoors yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>The girl looked away from the window, her violet eyes focusing up at the redheaded woman leering down at her.</p>
<p>&quot;You  can't though, can you? You're a sickly and frail asthmatic,  Hotaru-chan, and you'll never be anything more than that. Dreams are  for those with the ability to make their wishes true, not for someone  like you. So get dressed for school, and leave such fantasies behind.&quot;</p>
<p>As  Kaolinite left, little Hotaru hung her head and sighed. Turning back to  the window, she saw that the jogger was gone. Did even the jogger not  want to have anything to do with her? The thought made her feel even  sadder as she left the window to get dressed for another day of school.</p>
<p>As  she began to dress though, a thought occurred to her. What if the  jogger wasn't just going to jog by her window today, what if they were  going to do so tomorrow too? And maybe the next day? Who knows, maybe  the person would jog by her window from now on. The thought somehow  lifted her spirits a bit as she slipped her skirt on. If the jogger  went by every morning, wouldn't it give her something wonderful to look  forward to every morning?</p>
<p>Hotaru finished dressing and left her  bedroom, the thought of her new early morning friend giving her a  reason to smile as she descended the stairs to grab breakfast before  school.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>Haruka retraced her steps through  the park onto the school's grounds. Seeing her dorm once more, she let  loose and sprinted the last leg of it. She wanted to forget about  dreams, about school, about everything. She wanted to become the wind.  To be just like the wind, wrestling free from the domination of gravity  and plunging forth into the vast reaches of the sky.</p>
<p>Reaching the  building, she finally stopped as she gasped for air, her lungs burning  and her legs feeling like lead. After stretching once more, she went in  to take a shower before her classes began.</p>
