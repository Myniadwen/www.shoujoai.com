Ami wasn&#39;t sure that she could take many more surprises from this 
strange Jovian. How could he be ignorant of so many things? Her hands 
rested on his wrists, which she had pinned to his lap. She briefly noted 
the softness of his skin as she looked around to see if any bystanders 
had noticed the coins. Not seeing any scandalized faces, she turned to 
look up at him. His puzzled gaze on her made it hard to find the words 
she was searching for.

&quot;Well, the coins you see, they are for...uh...&quot; Why should this be such 
a hard thing to explain? How could no one have warned him ahead of time 
about it? Then she wouldn&#39;t be sitting here in such an awkward 
situation. Of course she knew the answer already. &#39;His customs are 
different from ours.&#39; She glanced over his shoulder to find Minako 
staring straight at her and grinning from ear to ear. Ami knew that the 
blond was enjoying the entire display. &quot;When you..&quot; she stumbled over 
her words.

&quot;They are best left unexplained and out of sight if you are a person 
with any self respect or decency,&quot; Rei interrupted flatly. Ami sighed in 
relief, &#39;thank the stars.&#39;

&quot;There you go, ruining all the fun again,&quot; Minako said, taking hold of 
the man&#39;s arm and pulling him closer, so that she could speak silently 
to him. Ami realized that she was still holding his wrists and quickly 
let go. They all turned to look at Minako.

&quot;If these two aren&#39;t brave enough to tell you, then I am,&quot; she smiled as 
she went on, &quot;seeing as how most of yours are yellow or red, I&#39;d say you 
could spend the entire evening with the lucky owner of whichever coin 
you choose. So in essence, they are invitations. You&#39;ll get to have some 
intimate time with whoever you&#39;d like.&quot;

&#39;Why does she have to do that?&#39; Ami thought, &#39;She makes it sound like a 
common activity. Like we&#39;re all a bunch of perverts or something.&#39; She 
blushed at her own thoughts. &#39;But at the same time, there is the fact 
that she manages to say it at all.&#39; Minako was always like this. It was 
one of her qualities. She always took everything as it came, without 
question, and was ashamed of nothing. She was a proud woman who would 
rise to any challenge, no matter if it was impossible for her. She was 
fearless in a dangerous way, and most of that danger could be directed 
toward herself at times. Ami was one of the most intelligent women in 
the universe, yet she couldn&#39;t form a simple explanation for a warrior 
who was from one of the most un-advanced cultures among the nine 
planets. She let her eyes drift to his masked face. &#39;So what if he might 
be handsome under that mask. She doesn&#39;t know that for sure.&#39; Ami 
thought, scrutinizing him thoroughly. &#39;He could be hideous, a complete 
monster...&#39; she looked at the wide expanse of his shoulders. His hair 
hung, tied loosely, down his back. It was a wave of auburn, and she&#39;d 
never seen anything like it on a person before. The other Jovians had 
dark brown hair that was almost black, or even deep red, but his was 
different. It kind of reminded her of...chocolate? Yes, that was it. The 
delicacy that they received from earth now and then. When warmed, it 
melted and became a viscous substance that held a rich brown color. 
She&#39;d come to like dipping fruits in it, and it was simply wonderful 
accompanied by a book. Ami became aware that she was straying off the 
topic she had been arguing with herself about.

&#39;Why is she trying so hard? He&#39;ll just be gone tomorrow anyway?&#39; He was 
probably just another dull, feeble minded warrior, who wouldn&#39;t be able 
to tell his head from a rock on the ground. Ami didn&#39;t like the way this 
Jovian was affecting her. She was a rational person, and very 
un-rational thoughts would go through her head whenever the man glanced 
in her direction or used his warm voice to address her. She would ignore 
it though. &#39;He&#39;ll be gone tomorrow anyway,&#39; she repeated in her mind to 
herself. It was this thought that reassured her that he had not thrown 
her being even a little off kilter. She&#39;d be fine tomorrow, when she 
didn&#39;t have to avoid his eyes.

The Jovian spoke, breaking Ami&#39;s silent self analysis. &quot;And why would I 
want to do that?&quot; he asked, agitated.

Minako&#39;s smile faltered momentarily. &quot;Well, I&#39;m not saying that you, 
personally, would want to. I didn&#39;t mean to offend you or anything. You 
asked.&quot;

The Jovian shook his head then rephrased his question. &quot;No, I mean, why 
would anyone want to spend a whole evening with someone, when they 
should be sleeping. I&#39;d imagine everyone would be tired after such a 
long ball. I know I am. Besides that, why couldn&#39;t a person do what any 
other would do, and request an audience through formal means. Not 
sticking their hands into my pockets as thieves would do,&quot; he frowned at 
the thought.

Minako&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;You have formal invitations for these kinds of 
things around Jupiter?&quot;

&quot;Quit being so nosey,&quot; Rei said, trying to halt her questioning.

She was ignored, though, as Minako continued, &quot;Even on Venus we don&#39;t 
acknowledge the existence of the coins. Yet you have formal invitations. 
Are Jovian customs really so...loose?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t see why you want to hide them? Are the princesses of your 
planets so unsociable? Well, anyway, it is common courtesy to let the 
one you wish to hold an audience with know ahead of time. You do not 
expect to be seen right away. For example, anyone who wants to hold an 
audience with the princess would seek one through the royal guard.&quot;

Minako managed to look delighted and shocked at the same time. &quot;You mean 
the princess of Jupiter? She does these sorts of things?&quot;

The blush that Ami had built up during the first part of the Jovian&#39;s 
explanation was starting to fade. She now realized that there was a 
misunderstanding, mostly caused by an overenthusiastic goddess of love 
and a seemingly simple-minded warrior. A quick glance at Rei told her 
that the other woman was thinking along the same lines. Her arms were 
crossed and she was glaring at Minako. Shingo, on her right, was hunched 
over trying to contain his laughter. His small frame shook with the 
effort. The boy must have understood Minako&#39;s explanation, and something 
about it he found highly amusing.

Looking back at the other two, Ami let out a sigh and asked, &quot;What, 
exactly, does the princess of Jupiter do at these meetings?&quot; Minako&#39;s 
mouth hung open in disbelief as she stared at Ami.

&quot;Depends on who is requesting the audience. Most of the time it&#39;ll be 
messengers from other satellites reporting their status. Sometimes it 
can be about petty quarrels, or just a request for transportation. 
Doesn&#39;t matter how large or small, the princess will see to all of them 
in time.&quot;

Ami smiled at Minako&#39;s confused look and said, &quot;I think that you have 
misunderstood the meaning of the coins, but that doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s 
obviously not something that you need to worry about.&quot; Beside her, 
Shingo couldn&#39;t help it. He burst into laughter at her words.

&quot;Well, I guess we now know why the planet with the most moons has the 
lowest population...&quot; Rei mumbled to Ami, who was trying to hide a grin.

&quot;You really have no idea what I meant, do you?&quot; Minako asked, 
disbelieving.

&quot;Well you said they were invitations. Requests for the time of another 
person. How else am I supposed to take it?&quot; He looked thoroughly annoyed 
now.

Minako was just about to say more, but Rei stopped her, &quot;Just drop it 
Minako!&quot;

Shingo suddenly stopped laughing and looked directly at Minako with an 
expression of surprise, or horror. Ami couldn&#39;t tell which. &quot;That name! 
You couldn&#39;t be...are you?&quot; he pointed toward her.

&quot;There you go yet again, spoiling all the fun,&quot; the blond said to Rei, 
who merely shrugged her shoulders and began to pat Shingo on the back.

Shingo stood so that her could properly bow to the Princess of Venus. &quot;I 
apologize your Highness, to be sitting here so casually with you. If I 
had known, I would have paid you the proper respect that is due to you,&quot; 
he continued rambling in embarrassment.

&quot;Ah, come on, sit down already. I get enough of that back home. I don&#39;t 
need it from you,&quot; Minako said, waving her hand at him.

Shingo sat down almost immediately and shut his mouth. The man now had 
his full attention on Minako, as he put the coins back into his pockets. 
He was studying her anew now, Ami could tell.

Minako smiled under his scrutiny.

&quot;You two don&#39;t have to be so surprised,&quot; Rei said, bored, &quot;She&#39;s nothing 
to get so excited about.&quot;

Ami could have sworn that Minako looked hurt by Rei&#39;s words for an 
instant, but it passed over her face so quickly that she couldn&#39;t tell. 
It would be strange if she was, for Rei&#39;s comments never fazed Minako 
any other time.

&quot;Ha! Excuse me for not being magnanimous enough for you, Rei,&quot; she 
stressed the other girl&#39;s name venomously.

Rei looked puzzled at Minako&#39;s retort. The Jovian fixed his attention on 
the brunette as Shingo let out a small &#39;yipe!&#39; and bowed to Rei.

&quot;Don&#39;t start,&quot; Rei said, looking sideways at Shingo.

&quot;So, I&#39;ve been sitting here with two princesses this whole time. Who 
just happen to invite me to their table...or is it three?&quot; The Jovian 
turned to look directly at Ami. His voice was sarcastic and a little 
accusing. &quot;The Princess of Mercury, I presume?&quot;

Ami simply nodded and looked away. Not knowing why, she didn&#39;t want to 
meet his gaze. Such a silly thought she&#39;d had. That someone&#39;s eyes might 
hold power over a person. But no matter, she still wouldn&#39;t risk it.

He filled his goblet with wine. &quot;This is a surprise. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d 
be found out so easily. I&#39;ve been yanked around enough tonight and I&#39;m 
growing extremely tired of it,&quot; he said, angry. &quot;I really don&#39;t feel 
like dealing with you three right now, so if you will excuse me...&quot; he 
rose from his seat, unsteadily.

&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Ami said, looking up at him, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; She 
couldn&#39;t figure out why their presence would offend him like this. 
They&#39;d never even met him before tonight.

&quot;Yeah, who&#39;s yanking you around?&quot; Minako asked, annoyed.

Rei stood up, facing him, &quot;What do you mean, dealing?&quot; Her voice was 
even and threatening.

&quot;Come on Shingo, I&#39;m not feeling so great. Let&#39;s get out of here.&quot; 
Shingo hesitated, looking between all three princesses. &quot;Now!&quot; the 
Jovian barked, stepping around Minako.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Rei&#39;s voice was sharp.

He stopped and looked at her. &quot;I&#39;m leaving early. If she has a problem 
with it,&quot; he motioned toward the dias, &quot;then so be it. She can punish me 
later when I&#39;m feeling better.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s with this sudden change in mood? You discover we&#39;re royalty and 
that makes you not want to be near us? And that is our Queen you&#39;re 
talking about. We don&#39;t so casually refer to her as &#39;She&#39;,&quot; You owe her 
your allegiance and respect.&quot; Rei finished, pointing from him to the 
dias. Minako nodded in agreement. Ami watched the Jovian go rigid and 
whirl to face Rei.

&quot;I owe her nothing!&quot; he growled furiously. Rei took one step back, 
shaken by his anger. The boy, Shingo, came forward at that point and 
pulled lightly on the man&#39;s jacket, getting his attention. The Jovian 
looked down at him and relaxed somewhat, then shook his head as if to 
clear it.

&quot;Who are you?&quot; Rei asked in a low voice. Ami concluded by the look on 
her face, that Rei must be picking up strange vibrations from him.

&quot;You know who I am. Why won&#39;t you people just leave me alone? I was 
ordered from my home to come here, when I should be there training the 
new soldiers and protecting the people.&quot;

&quot;That still doesn&#39;t answer my question. Are you a general? A captain 
maybe?&quot;

He opened his mouth to reply, but was interrupted by a musical voice, 
&quot;Causing trouble already I see.&quot;

Ami turned her head to see Michiru walk past them all to stop by the 
Jovian. Haruka trailed closely behind.

&quot;What do you want now?&quot; the man said, taking a step back from her, and 
glancing cautiously at Haruka, who grinned.

Unfazed, Michiru smiled at him, &quot;Oh come on, it wasn&#39;t that bad, was 
it?&quot; He lowered his head, not looking at her. She bent so that she could 
look up into his face. &quot;Was it really such a horrible kiss?&quot; Her smile 
widened at the shocked gasps that receded her statement.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I wouldn&#39;t know,&quot; he said, not meeting her eyes. &quot;I&#39;ve 
got nothing to compare it with. Nor do I have time to play your little 
games.&quot; His eyes flashed as he looked around at all of them. He then 
spun on his heal and stalked off into the crowd with Shingo following 
close behind.

&quot;Michiru, you kissed him?&quot; Rei asked, unbelieving.

&quot;And he&#39;s still alive?&quot; Minako said, looking to Haruka.

Haruka coughed and looked at Michiru. &quot;I think someone has a little 
explaining to do.&quot;

Michiru smirked and put her hands behind her back. &quot;Let&#39;s just say that 
a certain Uranian has been reprimanded for her actions tonight. What is 
that saying?&quot; she looked up as if contemplating. &quot;ah yes, do onto 
others, and so on?&quot; She looked pointedly at Haruka.

Haruka put her hands in the air before her as a sign of surrender. &quot;I 
already apologized for that. Sheesh, you&#39;d think I&#39;d slept with one of 
them, with the way your acting about it.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I trust you. I just like to remind you of where we stand. 
And I know you&#39;ll remember who you&#39;re leaving with tonight.&quot; She stepped 
closer to the taller woman. Haruka began to blush. Michiru was probably 
the only woman in the Universe who could get this reaction from her.

Haruka swallowed audibly, &quot;Well, I don&#39;t&#39; think you should go stealing a 
person&#39;s first kiss just to get my attention. There are lots of other 
ways to get at me. And many of them involve kissing.&quot; She began leaning 
towards Michiru.

&quot;Really? Why didn&#39;t I think of any of them?&quot; she asked, coming closer.

&quot;AHEM!&quot; Rei coughed, startling the couple. &quot;This is a ball, it&#39;s public. 
And I&#39;m not so bored as to become a voyeur at the moment, so if you 
wouldn&#39;t mind moving it somewhere else...&quot;

Michiru simply smiled at Rei and moved around Haruka to disappear into 
the crowd of dancers. Haruka stuck her tongue out at Rei, and winked at 
Minako, who Ami could have swore she heard repeating the phrase &quot;always 
spoiling the fun, always&quot;. Then she left to follow Michiru.

&quot;So...&quot; Minako said. &quot;Do you really think he&#39;s never kissed anybody? I 
think he was lying so that Haruka wouldn&#39;t pound him.&quot;

Ami didn&#39;t know what to think, honestly. She&#39;d never thought there could 
be a grown man, and a warrior at that, who had never been kissed. It was 
kind of amusing when one thought of it. It was really cute. Um, well, it 
was a cute concept that could be applied to any warrior that may have 
never been kissed. Not that she&#39;d thought of kissing him. Ami, herself 
was no stranger to it. She had been kissed a few times. To not know had 
been killing her, and she coveted knowledge, so she&#39;d tried it. It 
turned out that she didn&#39;t see what was so great about it. Ami was 
disappointed. She&#39;d been expecting something spectacular and amazing, 
but it had turned out awkward and uncomfortable. She really didn&#39;t see 
why Minako liked it so much. She hypothesized that you had to find 
someone who was good at it, then it might be different. It was an 
experiment she would leave for another day. She had much more important 
matters to look into.

&quot;I could care less,&quot; Rei sighed and looked around. &quot;I&#39;m still wondering 
why he got so mad at us. How are we supposed to know who he is. We just 
met him. When we unmask I&#39;m going to have a talk with the princess of 
Jupiter about that one.&quot;

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we be unmasking soon anyway?&quot; Ami asked, tiredly.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Minako answered. &quot;The time is really late. Usually we&#39;d be out 
of here by now, but since it&#39;s Usagi&#39;s birthday, I think we&#39;ve run a bit 
over.&quot;

&quot;She could also be compensating for the Jovians being so late,&quot; Rei 
added.

Minako and Ami nodded in agreement.

Rei leaned forward on the table, putting her chin in her hands.

&quot;He&#39;s still bothering you, isn&#39;t he?&quot; Minako said.

&quot;There was something about him.&quot; Rei answered.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Ami asked.

&quot;He was giving off some vibrations that he shouldn&#39;t be. Powerful ones. 
I don&#39;t know what they are, but they&#39;re really familiar to me for some 
reason.&quot;

&quot;They weren&#39;t, you know, like Negaverse feeling were they?&quot; Minako asked 
worriedly.

&quot;No, Minako, I think I&#39;d recognize those if I encountered them. I&#39;ll ask 
the princess about him, when I get the chance.&quot;

At that moment someone screamed. Collectively their heads turned to find 
the source of the noise. &quot;Minako, you know those Negaverse like feelings 
you were just talking about?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Minako answered.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m feeling them now...&quot; Minako looked at Rei, her eyes filled 
with concern.

People were panicking, and running for the nearest exits of the hall. 
There were too many people getting in the way to discern what was 
happening. Annoyed, Rei jumped up and began pushing her way through the 
tumult. Ami looked to Minako, who shrugged and followed Rei. Soon, Ami 
was right behind them.</pre>
