Michiru slowly opened her eyes, looking at the ceiling. She didn&#39;t know 
what it was that woke her up, maybe it was the sun shining on her eyes 
or maybe it were the footsteps at the door that had woken her up from 
her dreams, or in this case nightmares of the past.&quot;Ah Michiru, I am 
glad you&#39;re awake.&quot; She could hear a feminine voice say. It was now that 
she recalled that warm hand on her cheek earlier, the person calling her 
name.

Quickly Michiru sat up, scanning the room in the hope of seeing Haruka. 
Instead she was greeted by another blonde. Usagi.&quot;I was worried about 
you when you didn&#39;t answer the door, I asked your neighbour for the keys 
of your house. You were lucky they had one...&quot; Usagi paused when she saw 
the disappointed look on the other girl&#39;s face.&quot;Are you okay Michiru?&quot; 
She asked, sounding worried.

All she got was a nod in reply.&quot;You had been expecting Haruka, right?&quot; 
The small blonde then asked. As the words had left her mouth she already 
regretted them. Before she could even say something else Michiru had 
bursted into tears again.&quot;Oh my god, I am so sorry Michiru, please don&#39;t 
cry.&quot; Usagi pleaded, walking over to the girl and hugging her closely.

- Earlier that night, Chiba Residence-

Usagi sat on the couch, waiting for Mamoru to return home from work. Two 
days ago, after Galaxia had been freed from chaos Mamoru had proposed to 
her and ofcourse she had said yes. The scence was perfect, she cried, he 
was nervous and after getting her reply he got happy and relieved. It 
was almost too perfect. If you had looked closely you could&#39;ve seen the 
empty look in the princess&#39; eyes as he held her.

&quot;I am home!&quot; Mamoru&#39;s voice came. Imidiately Usagi put up a fake smile 
and run over to the door to greet her fianc&eacute;e.

&quot;Welcome home Mamoru!&quot; She cheered, holding him as she rested her head 
on his shoulder, trying to avoid having to kiss him. She hated she had 
to lie to him like this. But it was for the best. Even Luna had told her 
she had to continue this mission.&#39;It&#39;s not fair, everyone can live their 
normal lives and I have to stick to our mission even though we&#39;re 
safe...&#39; She thought, completely forgetting that she was still in her 
fianc&eacute;e&#39;s arms.

It was true. All the other senshi had been able to continue their lives 
as they were before the became senshi. Usagi on the other hand couldn&#39;t. 
She had to prepare herself for Crystal Tokyo. She would become the 
queen, marry Endymion and have his baby. Chibi-Usa. That was how it was 
and how it would be. Life after life and day after day. And to be 
honest, the thought of being stuck to this destiny forever pained her.

&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Mamoru questioned when he noticed the sudden 
silence of the blonde girl in his arms. When she pulled back her face 
was filled with tears. Tears she had forbidden herself to cry.&quot;Usako are 
you alright?&quot; The black haired man now asked. He dropped his case and 
with a concerned look on his face he held the small crying girl.

He would never know the reason for her tears. If he found out...&quot;I 
am...just so happy.&quot; Usagi lied.&quot;I mean I am getting married to the man 
I love, we&#39;re free now and I can live my life as...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t lie.&quot; He interrupted her, pulling back a little to look her into 
the eyes.&quot;I can see the difference between tears of happiness and tears 
of pain. The tears and the look on your face tell me nothing but pain, 
hurt and sorrow.&quot; Usagi was kind of shocked to hear him say that. No she 
was shocked to see him know her that well. Would he think the same, feel 
the same about their mission as she did? Was there someone else out 
there he truly loved. Someone who wasn&#39;t her. Someone who had never 
known a life filled with youma and sailor senshi.

&quot;I don&#39;t know why I am crying.&quot; Usagi stated, lying once more. This time 
he seemed to believe her so she decided to continue this lie.&quot;I think I 
am just sad that our mission is over somehow. Everyone is going to 
continue their lives and well, frankly I am afraid that...that we&#39;ll 
fall apart.&quot; Once again she could feel Mamoru pull her closer, holding 
her in a tight embrace.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Usako, they will never let that happen. You girls are too 
close to just fall apart like that.&quot; He whispered. Usagi felt guilty for 
lying at this point. He was so nice to her but at the same time he was 
hurting her because of that same reason.

After standing there in the hall way for a couple more minutes they 
pulled away. Usagi took his hand, leading him into the livingroom.&quot;I am 
going to make us something to eat.&quot; She said as she released his hand 
and started heading towards the kitchen.

&quot;Usako...&quot; He started. Usagi stopped walking, not daring to turn around. 
Did he know she had been lying? What would he want to say to her? 
Deciding to turn around anyway Usagi could see the blakc haired man walk 
up to her. It was obvious that he was going to kiss her. Usagi just 
stood there, waiting for his lips to be pressed on hers. Right on que it 
came. She could feel his lips touch hers for a couple of seconds. She 
slightly returned it. When he pulled back she smiled again.

&quot;I am glad you&#39;re home.&quot; She lied, placing a small kiss on his cheek 
before slowly heading towards the kitchen again. Mamoru just stood 
there, watching his fianc&eacute;e walk away again. He knew something was 
bothering her, he just didn&#39;t know what it was.

When Usagi closed the kitchen door behind her she finally managed to 
take a deep breath.&#39;I am such a horrible person.&#39; Instead of walking 
towards the fridge Usagi walked over to the phone that hang on the wall. 
It was now that she finally noticed that her hands were shaking. She had 
to talk to someone. Slowly she started dailing the first number that 
came to her mind. Setsuna&#39;s.

After a few seconds of waiting Usagi was greeted by Setsuna.&quot;Uhm, Hi 
Setsuna...This is Usagi. I was wondering...&quot; Usagi paused when she heard 
a tired voice on the back ground ask Setsuna who was calling.

&quot;Usagi.&quot; Setsuna replied, obviously to the other person that was with 
her in the room.&quot;Ah yes Usagi, what can I do for you?&quot; Setsuna then 
asked, focussing on the caller again.

&quot;I...who&#39;s there with you?&quot; Usagi questioned, not bothering to try to 
talk to Setsuna about the real reason she called.

&quot;Ah...No one.&quot; The other lied.

&quot;Don&#39;t lie Setsuna, I heard a voice asking you who called just a few 
seconds ago.&quot; The blonde pressed. After trying hard to realise why the 
voice had sounded so familair to her she figured out it was Haruka who 
was in the room with Setsuna. But why?

&quot;Haruka...&quot; The guardian of time finally muttered. Her voice was filled 
with shame.

&quot;Is Michiru there as well?&quot; Usagi now asked, getting the drift.

&quot;N-no...She isn&#39;t.&quot; Setsuna stuttered, even though she wasn&#39;t facing 
Usagi she knew that even her own princess was disappointed with her 
right now. It didn&#39;t take a genius to figure out what was really going 
on.

&quot;I see...&quot; Usagi replied, hanging up the phone before the other could 
even explain herself or say something. Usagi leaned against the wall for 
a couple of minutes, closing her eyes. Everything was getting so out of 
hand. This wasn&#39;t going how Chibi-Usa had told them it would be. Haruka 
and Michiru...Could it be that...Was Michiru even aware of the fact that 
Haruka was with Setsuna?

&#39;Michiru...She must be busy right now. I&#39;d better not bother her.&#39; Usagi 
thought. She still held the phone in her hands. Her hands weren&#39;t 
shaking anymore, instead of that she had clenched her hands tightly 
around the phone.

After taking another deep breath Usagi decided to call Rei but 
unconsciously she called another number. The number of a certain aqua 
haired girl. Still not knowing who she exactly had called Usagi put the 
phone to her ear, waiting for Rei to pick up. Her heart skipped a beat 
when she suddenly heard Michiru&#39;s voice on the other side of the line. 
Was Michiru at Rei&#39;s place?

&quot;Hi, this is...Usagi...&quot; The blonde stammered, feeling her heart race.

&quot;Hey Usagi, what can I do for you?&quot; Michiru asked politely. The other&#39;s 
voice sounded so empty, so lonely.

&quot;I am sorry to disturb you this late but to be honest Michiru...I need 
to talk to someone.&quot; It was out before she even knew it. No way back 
now.

&quot;It&#39;s okay Usagi, but if you don&#39;t mind me asking...Why me?&quot; Usagi 
blushed at that question. How could she explain Michiru that it had all 
been a tiny misunderstanding and a simple case of dailing the wrong 
number?

&quot;The others won&#39;t understand. Rei and Haruka would scold me for this. 
Makoto and Ami are too busy with...their own problems and Setsuna...I 
don&#39;t want to talk to her.&quot; The small blonde finally whispered, keeping 
her voice down in order for Mamoru not to overhear her. At first Usagi 
had seen her answer as a lie but after thinking about it she realised 
that Michiru maybe was the best person to talk with about this.

&quot;Ofcourse, I&#39;ll get dressed and make some tea for us, will I see you in 
an hour then?&quot; The other didn&#39;t reply to Michiru&#39;s question. Did she 
have a choice anyway? She had already said too much. She just hoped she 
would have done the right thing by calling the senshi of neptune, even 
though it happened by accident.

&quot;Goodbye then.&quot; Michiru&#39;s voice came, interrupting her out of her 
thoughts.&quot;I&#39;ll see you in an hour or so...&quot; Once again Usagi didn&#39;t say 
anything. Michiru seemed to wait for an answer for a short period of 
time before hanging up. Just when Usagi was about to put the phone back 
where it belonged the door to the kitchen opened, revealing Mamoru.

&quot;Usako, are you ok, I thought I heard you talking.&quot; He stated, looking 
at Usagi as if he was examining her.

&quot;Ah yes, Rei called me. She wanted to discuss something with me.&quot; She 
replied.&#39;The third time today that I lied to him...&#39;

&quot;I didn&#39;t hear the phone at all.&quot; Mamoru said, raising an eyebrow.

&quot;I only let it ring once.&quot; Usagi said, wondering why he was still here, 
bothering her.&#39;He&#39;s not bothering me, he&#39;s just worried about me!&#39; Usagi 
thought to herself. &quot;Would you mind it if you had to order something 
tonight Mamo-chan?&quot; Usagi asked, looking at her fianc&eacute;e.&quot;I have to go 
now, I promised Rei to be there within 30 minutes. I don&#39;t know why but 
she wanted me to hurry.&quot;

&quot;Ofcourse not, shall I drive you?&quot; He then asked as if he knew she was 
lying. The look on his face didn&#39;t betray the annoyance he was feeling 
towards the blonde girl but the tone in his voice betrayed him anyway.

&quot;No that&#39;s ok.&quot; The blonde princess replied, staring down at the 
floor.&quot;I wanted to take a late night walk anyway. You know, enjoy the 
fact I can walk the streets without fearing to be attacked by some 
creature from hell.&quot;

&quot;Just because chaos is gone...It doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t any 
creeps on the streets any...&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; Usagi interrupted him with a fake smile on her face.&quot;Let me 
order some chinese food for you, or do you prefer pizza?&quot; She then 
asked, changing the subject. Mamoru ofcourse also noticed the change of 
subject but decided not to bother anymore. It was obvious that she 
didn&#39;t want to talk about it.

&quot;Pizza will do fine.&quot; He replied before disappearing into the livingroom 
again.

- Present, Michiru&#39;s appartment-

After Michiru had stopped crying Usagi had disappeared into another room 
for a couple of minutes before returning again. In her hands she held a 
tray on which a cup of tea and a small piece of bread with cheese on it 
lay. Michiru had finally noticed the sun outside. It was already day. 
&quot;How long have I been asleep?&quot; She asked the blonde in front of her.

&quot;I came her last night...You were unconscious.&quot; Usagi started as she put 
the tray down on the small cupbaord next to Michiru&#39;s bed.&quot;I checked 
your temperature and it seemed you had a fever. That was around 10pm.&quot; 
Michiru gazed down at the clock radio next to her bed. It was 7am now.

&quot;You&#39;ve stayed with me the whole night?&quot; She asked. Michiru had to admit 
that she was a bit surprised by that. Usagi just nodded.

&quot;I was worried about you. Besides it&#39;s my duty to make sure you&#39;re ok.&quot; 
The blonde said with a smile on her face. Michiru who had laid down 
after she finished crying tried to sit up again to drink her tea but the 
moment she sat up she fell down again, holding her head.&quot;Michiru are you 
ok!?&quot; Usagi yelped, rushing over to her friend&#39;s side.

&quot;My head hurts. That&#39;s all.&quot; The aqua haired girl replied, laying down 
completely.

&quot;You&#39;re sick Michiru, you should stay put. I&#39;ll take care of you...&quot; She 
was cut off by the other.

&quot;NO!..&quot; Michiru yelled.&quot;I mean...no you don&#39;t have to. After all Mamoru 
is probably worried about you.&quot;

&quot;Probably...&quot; Usagi whispered. She stopped staring at the other girl and 
now focussed on the floor as if it was the most interesting thing on 
earth.

&quot;Did you got into a fight with Mamoru?&quot; Came the question.

&quot;No. We&#39;re doing fine.&quot; Usagi said. Half of it was a lie, the rest was 
the truth, right? She couldn&#39;t bother Michiru with her problems right 
now anyway. The aqua haired girl stared at the other with a certain look 
on her face as if she already could tell Usagi was lying or hiding 
something.

&quot;I am glad to hear that. Thinking of it, what was bothering you last 
night?&quot; Michiru questioned the other girl who still was looking at the 
ground.

&quot;Oh never mind that. I had some doubts about something but not anymore.&quot; 
Usagi said.&quot;And don&#39;t worry about Mamoru. He knows I am here, I called 
him a few hours ago after I found you.&quot; Michiru just nodded. She knew 
Usagi was lying but she decided not to ask about it right now. Her 
headache was increasing as they spoke.

&quot;Michiru...&quot; Usagi suddenly asked after another five minutes of silence.

&quot;Yes?&quot;

Usagi swallowed away the lump that had formed in her throat.&quot;Is it ok 
if...I mean...&quot;

&quot;Just ask your question Usagi, it&#39;s not like I am going to bite you.&quot;

&quot;Can I...&quot; Usagi paused for a moment while a blush appeared on her 
face.&quot;Can I sleep with you for a while?&quot; Michiru just smiled and patted 
on the empty spot next to her. At first she had been surprised with 
hearing Usagi ask such a thing, simply because she had misunderstood the 
meaning behind the other&#39;s question at first.&quot;Thanks...&quot; Usagi added 
before she slowly lay down next to the aqua haired girl, for once 
enjoying the fact that someone was laying beside her.

To be Continued...

Nope Mamoru is not that kind of bastard in this story but to those who 
asked for it, I will make him suffer anyway. Whaha join the 
we-hate-Mamoru club.</pre>
