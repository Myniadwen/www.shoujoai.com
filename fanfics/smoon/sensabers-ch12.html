<h1>Senshi Sabers (part 12 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/sensabers-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Haruka gave Usagi a impish look, the four of them
striding along the street in a protective team. &quot;You
know,&quot; the sandy haired young woman noted, &quot;people are
going to think we&#39;re Rei&#39;s groupies, or something.&quot;

&quot;I do not have groupies,&quot; Rei growled, disregarding
the young men and not a few women who had been
cheering her band only a few minutes ago.

&quot;Oh I don&#39;t know,&quot; Michiru said mildly, her long green
hair glimmering, &quot;I was in the crowd when that girl
threw her panties on the stage for you.&quot;

Rei blushed even as Usagi smiled. Still the tall
blonde stepped in to help Rei, &quot;It could have been for
one of her bandmates.&quot;

&quot;Even if she yelled &#39;Rei-sama&#39; when she threw it?&quot;
Haruka asked.

&quot;Just leave it alone,&quot; Rei sighed. The black haired
rocker had a faint blush on her cheeks, trying to walk
forward as casually as possible.

&quot;So how long have you known Rei?&quot; Usagi asked Haruka
and Michiru, the AD police officer studying the two
curiously.

&quot;Not long,&quot; Michiru suddenly threw her arms around the
startled Rei, &quot;We&#39;re her groupies!&quot;

&quot;Michiru,&quot; Haruka rolled her eyes as Rei struggled in
her grip. Meeting Usagi&#39;s gaze she simply said, &quot;We
met her not long ago, actually.&quot;

&#39;Good,&#39; Usagi thought, glad that the charming blonde
wasn&#39;t competition for Rei. Of course the thoughtful
looks that Haruka were giving her were making Usagi a
bit nervous, too. &quot;Well, it&#39;s nice to meet you,&quot; she
said.

&quot;Likewise,&quot; Haruka nearly purred.

Michiru looked amused, keeping a firm grip on Rei. &quot;Do
you think I could trade her in for you?&quot; she asked Rei
impishly.

&quot;Somehow I don&#39;t think you&#39;re serious,&quot; Rei said
wryly.

Usagi was about to say something when off in the
distance there was a explosion! &quot;Damn it,&quot; she scanned
the horizon, seeing the spark of flames rising even as
her cellphone rang. &quot;Tsukino,&quot; she barked, stepping
away from Rei and the others.

&quot;I think we should excuse ourselves,&quot; Haruka said to
Rei regretfully. She smiled, &quot;I hope we&#39;ll see you in
a few days.&quot;

&quot;It was good to see you again,&quot; Michiru added, the two
moving off down the street.

Rei waved good-bye casually even as she jerked
slightly, her silenced cellphone vibrating slightly.
&quot;Yo,&quot; Rei flipped it open, somehow not surprised to
see Ami.

&quot;Are you alone?&quot; Ami asked tersely. Stepping away a
bit farther from Usagi Rei nodded and Ami continued,
&quot;There&#39;s a Bio-boomer on the rampage not far from Hot
Legs, we&#39;re already on our way to pick you up.&quot;

Rei gave the street address she was standing at even
as she said, &quot;I&#39;ve got Tsukino with me, I&#39;ll have to
ditch her first.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll handle it,&quot; Ami said dryly before
hanging up.

Usagi finished her phone call only a few moment&#39;s
later, giving Rei an apologetic look, &quot;Duty calls,&quot;
she sighed, &quot;I gotta go.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure if you track the criminal as well as you
seem to pretty girls,&quot; Rei said dryly, &quot;you&#39;ll have
things in hand in no time.&quot;

&quot;Why thank you,&quot; Usagi surprised Rei with a smile. A
bit more seriously she asked, &quot;I&#39;m going to get my
bike, do you need a ride anywhere?&quot;

Rei smiled back, touched by her concern. &quot;Don&#39;t
worry,&quot; she answered firmly, :&quot;I have a friend coming
to pick me up.&quot;

&quot;Maybe someday we can actually talk,&quot; Usagi added as
she jogged off, her long blonde hair flowing behind
her in twin streams.

&#39;Not if I can help it,&#39; Rei thought, watching Usagi
ride by a few moments later on her motorcycle. It
wasn&#39;t long before the Silky Doll truck arrived,
Minako behind the wheel and Makoto in the passenger
side.

&quot;This could be interesting,&quot; Makoto commented as the
amazonian woman popped the door open to the back of
the truck.

Rei smoothly climbed aboard the truck, nodding her
acknowledgment to Ami Mizuno. The owner of the Silky
Doll and de-facto leader of the Senshi Sabers was
already armored, her icy blue suit suiting her
thoughtful, remote expression. Her blue hair fell into
her eyes, the helmet sitting beside her on the bench.

&quot;What&#39;s the situation?&quot; Rei asked, stripping her
jacket off as she walked over to where her Hardsuit
was mounted on the wall.

&quot;It&#39;s going to be more dangerous,&quot; Ami commented as
she turned her head. her eyes unwillingly lingering as
Rei stripped &quot;we&#39;ve got a military model on the
loose.&quot;

&quot;I thought military models were banned in Japan?&quot; Rei
blinked, standing there in just her lacy bra and
panties.

&#39;I wonder if she got them at the Silky Doll?&#39; Ami
found herself wondering, a faint blush on her cheeks.
&quot;Officially they are,&quot; Ami kept her voice steady by
force of will, &quot;but may companies ship them in
illegally for security purposes.&quot;

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Rei cursed as she hit the switch to open up
the armor&#39;s main body, climbing in and sliding the
metal over her cool skin.

&quot;There&#39;s an update from the AD Police,&quot; Nene yelled
from up front, using a set of headphones to monitor
the police communication nets, &quot;sounds like they&#39;re
not having much luck containing the Bio-boomer.&quot;

&quot;Not surprising,&quot; Makoto commented, holding on to the
dashboard as Nene executed a rough turn to avoid a
police roadblock.

&quot;Get us as close as you ca to the edge of the police
perimeter,&quot; Ami ordered crisply, &quot;then we&#39;ll get
armored up and go in.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Nene grinned.

They pulled in behind a office building, not far from
where the police sirens wailed, then they all finished
armoring up. Rei lead the charge, her blood red suit
gleaming as they bounded up to a rooftop to get a
better view of the situation.

&quot;Damn,&quot; Makoto murmured, her forest green armor
shining in the twilight.

The Bio-boomer was a big one, nearly ten foot tall,
it&#39;s body designed for heavy lifting. It&#39;s normally
smooth form was angular with segments of metallic
armor, alloy giving it a ominous look, as did the
cannons grafted to it&#39;s back and at the ends of each
heavily muscled arm.

&quot;Minako, what can you tell us?&quot; Ami asked, seemingly
calm.

Minako&#39;s golden armor possessed the best sensors of
the group, as well as a variety of other gear and she
was an expert at using it. &quot;The exoshell is heavy
armor,&quot; she reported, &quot;maybe even a titanium alloy.
The weapons are shielded, sorry to say.&quot;

Rei nodded towards a boxy unit on it&#39;s back, &quot;That
almost looks like someone took a missile launcher and
grafted it on.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll have to be cautious doing this,&quot; Ami warned,
&quot;and the armor will make things more complicated.
First we&#39;ll have to break through that, then go for
heart crystal all while evading it&#39;s guns.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s not much we can plan,&quot; Makoto shrugged, &quot;I go
in to deal with it directly, my strength and cutting
blades give me the best shot. Minako uses ECM and
visual effects to distract it along with Rei and Ami.&quot;

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Minako started.

&quot;I don&#39;t see any better way,&quot; Makoto said firmly,
looking towards her lover, &quot;and I bet you don&#39;t
either, m&#39;love.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s right,&quot; Ami said firmly.

&quot;Then let&#39;s go,&quot; Rei leapt off the side of the
building, bringing her arm cannon up even as the
Bio-boomer did. Before it could fire she shot a needle
right down the barrel of her enemy&#39;s weapon, the
delayed charge exploding inside.

With a flash the end of the Bio-boomer&#39;s arm exploded,
fragments of metal and artificially generated flesh
splattering outward, Shockingly the smoking stump
began to regenerate almost immediately, a misshapen
hand reforming where the gun had rested.

&quot;Should we...&quot; Naru asked, holding her gun at the
ready among the AD Police officers.

Usagi hesitated, then the blonde haired officer shook
her head. &quot;Give them their shot,&quot; she said, &quot;if we
have to we can arrest the winner.&quot;

&quot;Mistress...&quot; the Bio-boomer hissed out through a
deformed jaw, partially blocked by the laser cannon
that had been installed there.. &quot;nine!&quot; The backpack
opened, spewing missiles that rained down on the
battlefield.

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Minako cursed as she frantically jammed
tracking systems an defused internal systems,
rendering most of the missiles harmless.

Shrugging off a near miss Makoto ducked beneath a wild
swing of her larger foe, electrically charged cables
swinging out from her suit to slice at the armor. &#39;Did
that thing say Mistress Nine?&#39; she wondered eve as she
swung up to break it&#39;s distended jaw.

&#39;How did this thing get free,&#39; Ami wondered as she
swung her silver swords, the blades trailing supercold
fluid, cutting into another arm with a unearthly
grace, &#39;and do I really want to know?&#39;</pre>
