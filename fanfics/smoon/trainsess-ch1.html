<h1>Training Session</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/crumpet04.html">Crumpet04</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Blue eyes looked down from their hide out high in an old tree.  The pair 
of eyes had been up in that tree for most of the night.  They just 
couldn&#39;t stand to leave the one they cared about alone, although the 
quarry that the blue eyes happened to be hunting knew nothing of the 
silent watch.  If they did the blue eyes would disappear.  They couldn&#39;t 
let their prey know they were being watched.

And so the eyes stayed hidden.  Hiding was something that was natural to 
the owner of the eyes by now.  The bright blue eyes blinked as stray 
strands of blonde hair got into their viewing space, and a delicately 
strong hand brushed them behind their right ear, never turning away from 
the shadows of the familiar shrine.

The dark haired shito priestess had entered the fire room about an hour 
before, but her unknown guard had not taken that as a sign to leave.  
Instead the figure had lain out on the strong branch of the tree she was 
perched in, in order to see through a small hole in the roof of the fire 
room.

Finally the door slid open revealing a refreshed looking maiden dressed 
in her priestess clothes.  The eyes, which had been idly watching a 
firefly, sharpened on their prey.  Taking in the heat induced sweat on 
her forehead, the confidence in those amethyst eyes of hers, and the 
power radiating off of the priestess.  A gloved hand hoisted the rest of 
the slim body off of its resting place against the limb.

The black haired girl took off quickly to the left as if she had 
remembered she was late for an appointment, the ever vigilant blue eyes 
following her until she turned a corner and was out of sight.  The eyes 
retreated into the gathering of the leaves, hiding once more.

Seconds later Sailor Mars appeared by the corner the young priestess had 
flown around.

&quot;I&#39;m going to get you.&quot;  The fire senshi said with a sing song to her 
voice.

In reply the blue eyed senshi hid even further into the tree.

Mars kept walking, ever turning around trying to find the person she was 
now hunting.  The eyes watched as she came closer and closer to their 
hiding spot.

They were waiting for the black haired girl to hit just the right spot.  
She was almost there.  As Sailor Mars got further into the middle of the 
yard she ignited her hands, ever ready if her prey decided to attack.

The flames danced from one hand to the other waiting patiently till 
their master needed them.  They comforted the red senshi and she 
continued her search.

&#39;Just a bit more&#39; the figure up in the tree thought. &#39;One more step.&#39;

The fire senshi took that one step and heard from above her.

&quot;Venus love me chain!&quot;  Before the warrior could dodge, the yellow chain 
of hearts came down like a lasso encircling her middle and raising her 
clear off the ground.

Sailor Venus jumped down from the tree.

&quot;You&#39;ll have to do better than that to catch me.&quot;  She winked at the 
fire senshi still hanging in mid air.

&quot;How are you doing that?&quot;  The enraged fire senshi screamed at Sailor 
Venus.

She smirked, &quot;Oh, I tied it to the tree.&quot;  She winked and jumped away 
before Mars broke free of the love me chain.&quot;

Mars luckly was getting madder with every passing second.

She had been caught!

She was dangling in mid air.

Her hair was getting messed up!

With every passing thought the heat in her body intensified.  The fire 
that was inside her was screaming to be let out.

She struggled against the chain and got even madder when it wouldn&#39;t 
budge, the heat in her rising to new degrees of hot.

&quot;Why that little sneak&quot; Mars said to no one in particular &quot;She won&#39;t get 
away with this.  I&#39;ll catch her.&quot;  And as Mars was talking to herself, 
the chain started to weaken from the immense heat it was being 
introduced to.  Finally buckling and sending the enraged senshi 
plummeting the whole two feet back to the earth.

She flew up and scanned the yard quickly for any signs of blonde hair, 
or the orange and blue fuka.

&quot;Hey&quot; A voice behind her seemed to whisper.

Sailor Mars turned around and shot a controlled beam of fire in the 
direction of the voice.

Nothing.  She had hit air, and right now that was not her target.

Venus laughed in her head as she kept fooling the Martian.

&quot;Come out, come out were ever you are, my little love goddess.&quot;  Mars 
taunted.

Venus stayed right were she was.

&#39;If she thinks I&#39;m going to fall for that she&#39;s got another thing 
coming.&#39; She nodded her head once she finished thinking as if to say 
&#39;that&#39;s right!&#39;

There was a rustling in the bushes behind her and Venus turned sending a 
crescent beam attack at the unsuspecting squirrel, revealing her 
location.

Mars smirked and ran toward the bush she had seen the yellow light burst 
from.

Venus catapulted out of her useless hiding space and made a break for 
the nearest tree.

This time though Mars was ready for her.  She sent a streak of fire 
across Venus&#39;s path forcing her to stop and try to find a new route.

She quickly changed her course, but instead of finding plenty of room to 
run, she found the purple bow of Sailor Mars.

Mars smirked and grabbed Venus, not letting her move.

She was caught.

&quot;I&#39;ve got you now Venus.&quot;  Mars stated while holding Venus&#39;s arms at her 
side.  The fire in the Martians&#39; eyes was beyond boiling, but this fire 
wasn&#39;t fueled by rage, this fire was fueled by desire, want, and love.

Suddenly Mars&#39;s lips came crashing down on Venus; Venus reacting 
immediately.  Her arms were released and they slithered around the fire 
senshi&#39;s neck.  While the kiss sustained the two senshi dissolved into 
their common identities.

&quot;Aishiteru Mina-chan.&quot;

&quot;Aishiteru&quot;  The blonde replied. &quot;That was a good training session.  To 
bad it&#39;s over.&quot;

&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry fearless leader, I&#39;ve got another training session we 
need to go to.&quot;  Rei said leading a blushing Mina toward her bedroom.</pre>
