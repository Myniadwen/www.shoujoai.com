<h1>Bubblegum Hime (part 6 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/bubblehime-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Alyssa Searrs paused as the busty blonde teenager entered the smoky 
nightclub, her well tailored business wear looking out of place in the 
dim light. She turned her head to her companion and said, &quot;Stay close, 
Miyu.&quot;

The tall, blue haired woman with glasses looked around them warily as 
Miyu said, &quot;Yes, Alyssa.&quot; She quickly sorted through the data she had 
absorbed and reported, &quot;Our target is in the rear booth, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Alyssa murmured as they forged ahead through the crowd, 
past a pool table and the bar towards a quieter corner.

The redhead who was sitting in the corner looked too young for the drink 
she was having, texting a message on her phone as she watched them 
coming closer. Finishing up she closed the phone and put it away as she 
asked, &quot;Miss Searrs?&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Alyssa slid into the seat, Miyu following as she met the 
redhead&#39;s eyes, &quot;and you&#39;re Nao Yuuki.&quot;

&quot;The most notorious former delinquent at Fuka Academy,&quot; Miyu noted.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m that bad,&quot; Nao smiled slightly, &quot;Natsuki and Shizuru 
are becoming more famous for their escapades.&quot;

&quot;Possibly,&quot; Miyu conceded.

Alyssa cleared her throat, &quot;I understand you have something to offer 
us?&quot;

Nao nodded, &quot;I have information on the Hime Soldiers... what&#39;s it worth 
to you?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s se it first,&quot; Alyssa held out her hand with a unconscious 
authority.

&quot;How do I know you won&#39;t try to rip me off?&quot; Nao asked skeptically.

Miyu&#39;s eyes narrowed with anger behind her glasses as she nearly got out 
of her chair, &quot;Miss Alyssa would never...!&quot;

&quot;Easy,&quot; Alyssa held up a calming hand as she looked at Nao, &quot;I&#39;ve played 
it straight with you before, Yuuki.&quot;

&quot;Through your representatives, yeah,&quot; Nao studied her a moment then 
nodded agreement. &quot;All right,&quot; she produced her phone, &quot;pictures of the 
Hime in action.&quot;

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Alyssa conceded as she flipped through the images of the 
group of mysterious armored soldiers. &#39;We have similar data, but...&#39; she 
mused as she took out a small bundle of cash and passed it to Nao.

&quot;Did you track them back home?&quot; Miyu asked flatly, clearly still 
displeased with the young woman.

Nao counted the money then stuffed it into her pocket as she answered, 
&quot;No, they were too fast for me.&quot; She waited a second and smiled, &quot;I did 
manage to keep up with them long enough to see they were heading right 
to the dorms.&quot;

&quot;So they may be students,&quot; Alyssa&#39;s eyes narrowed in thought.

Miyu cooly noted, &quot;Or it could simply be a blind. They proceed to the 
school then scatter in five different directions.&quot;

&quot;Hmph,&quot; Nao sat back with a scowl.

Alyssa hid a smile as she got up, Miyu following. &quot;Thank you for your 
help, Nao,&quot; she said as they turned to go, &quot;keep up the good work.&quot;

&quot;Will do,&quot; Nao promised with a casual wave of her hand.

Once they were out of the building Miyu looked at Alyssa in confusion, 
&quot;Mistress, we didn&#39;t need to buy that data, I had already recorded the 
Hime Soldiers in battle.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Alyssa answered her as they headed across the parking lot to 
the company car, &quot;I paid her to keep her investigating for us. Even if 
she finds nothing, it&#39;ll still be worth it having a inside woman in 
Fuka.&quot;

&quot;Understood, Mistress,&quot; Miyu answered. They stopped by the car and 
waited for Miyu to scan the vehicle, then they climbed inside. Taking 
the driver&#39;s seat Miyu asked curiously, &quot;Do you think she&#39;ll be useful 
to us?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Alyssa conceded, &quot;but better be safe than sorry.&quot;

Back inside the bar Nao sat back in her chair as she dialed a certain 
number. &quot;Did you get all that?&quot; she asked, smiling slightly.

Haruka and Yukino emerged from the crowd, their disguises making both 
women look remarkably seedy as Yukino closed her phone. &quot;Thank you for 
contacting us about this,&quot; Yukino said, &quot;Mashiro will be arranging a 
reward for your trouble.&quot;

Haruka gave Nao a thoughtful look as she asked, &quot;Did you just arrange to 
get paid twice for all this?&quot;

Nao smiled back, &quot;That&#39;s one way to look at it.&quot;

&quot;Mercenary,&quot; Haruka sniffed.

&quot;Always,&quot; Nao answered her promptly, smiling. She looked over at Yukino, 
&quot;She didn&#39;t seem surprised by anything I told her, too.&quot;

Yukino frowned, &quot;So either she has a very good poker face or Alyssa 
Searrs knows more about Fuka than I&#39;m comfortable with.&quot;

Haruka nodded seriously, &quot;That isn&#39;t good news.&quot;

Nao got up as she asked them, &quot;Either of you want a drink? I need a 
refill.&quot;

&quot;As long as you&#39;re not drinking booze,&quot; Yukino noted absentmindedly.

&quot;You&#39;re no fun, Yukino,&quot; Nao sighed.

Meanwhile at First District Nagi walked down the corridor towards the 
labs, the spring in the young man&#39;s step showing his pleasure. He 
reached a certain door and knocked, waiting patiently before he heard a 
woman call out, &quot;Come in.&quot;

Dr. Saeko Kuga was the spitting image of her daughter Natsuki, plus ten 
years or so. Her long black hair flowed down her back as she walked over 
to a microscope, studying something there as she casually waved Nagi 
inside.

&quot;Hiya Doc,&quot; Nagi settled into a empty chair by the bench, &quot;how&#39;s it 
going?&quot;

Saeko peered through the microscope as she said, &quot;I&#39;ve nearly got that 
armor upgrade finished, assuming no interruptions.&quot;

Not taking the hint Nagi sat back with a smile as he said in a sing song 
voice,&quot; I know something you don&quot;t know.&quot;

&quot;Nagi...&quot; Saeko sounded peeved, &quot;what is it?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve found Natsuki,&quot; Nagi sounded terribly self satisfied.

Saeko whirled around, looking at her employer in shock. After a few 
moments she recovered enough to demand, &quot;Where!&quot;

Nagi actually looked mildly disgusted as he said, &quot;Actually, she&#39;s been 
right under our noses for the whole time. She&#39;s at Fuka academy.&quot;

&quot;Fuka...?&quot; Saoko blinked, taking that fact in, &quot;But why...?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Nagi admitted, &quot;it could have something to do with 
Mashiro, it could be just a coincidence or she might even be looking for 
you.&quot;

&quot;The last isn&#39;t terribly likely,&quot; Saoko said flatly, &quot;I&#39;m legally dead, 
remember?&quot;

&quot;It was your idea,&quot; Nagi said a bit defensively, &quot;you were worried your 
husband had found out about the affair you were having.&quot;

&quot;I remember,&quot; Saoko conceded.

&quot;Do you want to contact her?&quot; Nagi asked curiously, rather enjoying the 
conflicted look on his employee&#39;s face.

Saoko sighed as she looked at the armor she was developing, just one of 
the many components of her life&#39;s work. &quot;Not yet,&quot; she said regretfully, 
&quot;I want to finish this, and I don&#39;t want any distractions.&quot;

&#39;People say bad things about me,&#39; Nagi mused as he got up, &#39;but I think 
Saoko takes the cake for singlemindedness.&#39; Aloud he said, &quot;I&#39;ll have 
our agent keep an eye on her for you.&quot;

&quot;Just remind Mr. Smith to keep his head down,&quot; Saoko said flatly, &quot;if he 
gets caught all of us could be in trouble.&quot;

&quot;Right, right,&quot; Nagi waved casually as he left.

Back in the lab Saoko slumped against the counter, letting lose the 
emotions she had hid from her employer. &quot;Oh Natsuki,&quot; she whimpered 
softly, fighting back tears as she thought of her daughter whom she 
believed lost to her forever.

After a moment&#39;s thought Saoko pulled out her phone and dialed, 
listening until a familiar voice answered, &quot;This is Rena Sayers, how can 
I help you?&quot;

&quot;Rena, it&#39;s me,&quot; Saoko answered, glad to hear her lover&#39;s voice.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Rena asked, instantly picking up on her lover&#39;s 
distress.

Saoko smiled slightly, &quot;Nagi&#39;s found Natsuki for me...&quot;

&quot;Seriously?!&quot; Rena sounded startled. A moment later she asked, &quot;Do you 
want me to check up on her?&quot;

&quot;You read my mind,&quot; Saoko sighed, &quot;thanks.&quot;

&quot;Anything for you, love,&quot; Rena answered warmly.
