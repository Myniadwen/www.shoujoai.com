<a href="../girlfriends/fireworks-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Leaning back on her bed, with Akko&#39;s warm breath in her ear, Mari closes 
her eyes and remembers Akko&#39;s shocked face when Mari had kissed her the 
last time. She opens her eyes, and sees Akko this time, her face inches 
away, her long hair mingling with Mari&#39;s, tickling her neck. Akko&#39;s eyes 
are bright, and her lips parted.  

It may last a few moments or a few hours, the feeling Mari had dreamed 
about and Akko had once feared. Their lips meet as gently as when Akko 
had been asleep, as passionately as when Mari had tried to confess to 
her, and as long as they both needed to be sure. Satisfied and in need 
of air, Mari lays her palm on Akko&#39;s warm cheek. Akko sits up a little, 
panting and flushed, her hands on Mari&#39;s shoulders, unaware till then 
she had been sitting astride Mari, when a blur of motion, a yelp, and a 
thud by the door jolt them both to their feet.  

Mariko hisses &quot;Takeshi!&quot; and Akko springs to the doorway and blocks his 
escape. Cornered, Mari&#39;s brother slumps down, his feet to either side, 
and looks, guiltily, at the floor.  

&quot;How long were you...?&quot; Mari starts to ask. Akko hides her face behind 
one hand, keeping the door shut with the other.  

&quot;What were you two, I mean, why were two, um, I mean, are you 
two...together?&quot;  

Mari kneels by her brother and gently lays a hand on his shoulder. 
&quot;I&#39;m... Yes, Takeshi,&quot; looking then at Akko, &quot;we are.&quot; Akko nods and 
sits, her back against the door, stifling a yawn.  

Takeshi gets a sly smile on his face. &quot;You know, I think this is just 
the sort of thing mom and dad would like to know about, don&#39;t you?&quot; Mari 
gasps, covering her mouth with both hands, her eyes saucerlike. 

&quot;You... You wouldn&#39;t!&quot; She stammers.  

&quot;Of course not,&quot; Takeshi chirps, smugly. &quot;Not, at any rate, for the 
right price.&quot; 

Akko crawls toward Takeshi from behind and leans over him, 
threateningly. She&#39;s fuming, and Mari&#39;s waving her hands to get Akko to 
calm down. &quot;You little jerk! How can you treat your big sister like 
that?&quot;  

Takeshi cowers and practically dives into Mari&#39;s lap. &quot;Onee-san! Your 
girlfriend is scaaaaryy!&quot; Akko starts to laugh, and Mari wipes a tear 
from her eye. &quot;Okay, ototo. You win. What about if my scary girlfriend 
and I treat you to a day at Hanayashiki?&quot;  

Akko thinks, &quot;Hanayashiki? Isn&#39;t that the tiny, old amusement park? Why 
go there?&quot;* 

Takeshi smiles in agreement, stands up, and marches happily back to his 
room. When the door closes, Akko rolls her eyes, and Mari crosses the 
room, takes her hands, and helps her to her feet. They stand awkwardly 
for a moment, and then Akko leans into Mari and rests her head on Mari&#39;s 
shoulder. Mari thinks &quot;Now what do I do? I still want to kiss her, but 
she&#39;s practically asleep...Then again,&quot; she blushes, &quot;that didn&#39;t stop 
me before.&quot; 

She helps Akko walk over to the futon her mother set out, and lie down. 
Yawning, she looks at the clock. It&#39;s 1:30 in the morning. Akko is sound 
asleep, on top of the comforter on the futon. Mari thinks, &quot;It&#39;s no 
surprise she&#39;s tired. I should let her sleep. Then she climbs into her 
own bed, pulls the sheets up, and closes her eyes, a big smile on her 
face.  

She wakes up a little later, shivering, and looks at Akko, who&#39;s still 
on top of the comforter, but shaking with cold. Mari gets up and tries 
to shift Akko around to get under the comforter, but can&#39;t manage. 
&quot;Seriously, Akko!&quot; she thinks. &quot;Maybe just a bit less junk food!&quot; 
Finally, sweaty and frustrated, she looks at the comforter on her own 
bed, pulls it off to cover Akko, and climbs under it, behind Akko, who 
is lying on her side.  

&quot;Yeesh! Cold feet.&quot; Then, with Akko&#39;s hair in her face, Mari smiles and 
closes her eyes, drifting off to sleep as she thinks, &quot;she smells nice.&quot;
