<h1>Fireworks Festival (part 1 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../girlfriends/index.html">Girl Friends</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shijou.html">Shijou</a><br> </h2>
<pre>On the morning of the fireworks festival, Akko shows up in mini-shorts 
and a fragment of blouse that sends Mrs. Kumakura&#39;s eyebrows above her 
hairline. Mari doesn&#39;t mind the view, which only Akko really notices. 
She feels a little uncomfortable having Mari stare at her so openly, and 
doesn&#39;t protest when Mrs. Kumakura makes them both wear yukatas.  

Since Mrs. Kumakura bought both yukatas for Mari at the same place, they 
look alike. She makes all sorts of embarrassing comments about how cute 
Mari and Akko look, and Mari&#39;s little brother teases her about going on 
a date with a girl, at which point heavy objects are thrown in his 
direction.  

At the fireworks festival, Mari wants to drag Akko around to all the 
booths, but Akko gets a blister from wearing the geta, and star\ts to 
get tired from being up so late the night before. Mari makes Akko sit 
and runs to get her something to drink.  

Akko looks after Mari and realizes something. &quot;Wow. She really looks 
nice in a yukata,&quot; she thinks. While she&#39;s daydreaming, Harada, the 
college-age boy Mari has been seeing to hide her feelings for Akko shows 
up with another friend of his. Harada&#39;s friend, who encouraged him to 
make a move on Mari, notices Akko sitting on the grass with a shoe off, 
looking distracted, and gets an idea.  

He finds a little kid tearing around with a few of his friends, hands 
him the can of juice he just bought and tells the boy to spill it on 
Akko. The boy haggles, and Harada&#39;s friend ends up giving him a sizeable 
chunk of cash.  

Akko leaps up, yelling, when the boy does this, and the boy splits, 
laughing, cash in hand. Harada&#39;s friend steps in and pretends to help 
Akko. He thinks he&#39;s slick, and Akko&#39;s really distracted and unhappy, so 
she&#39;s not really on her defenses. Harada&#39;s friend manages to get her to 
sit on the grass and leans close, putting an arm around her shoulder. At 
this moment, Mari comes back and actually says what she felt the last 
time she saw Akko with a boy.  

&quot;Don&#39;t touch her! Get away from her right now!&quot; 

Mari&#39;s voice carries across the park where people are watching the 
fireworks. Everyone in the area turns to watch, as Mari steps between 
Akko, who&#39;s half-reclining on the ground, and Harada&#39;s friend, her fists 
raised.  

Nearby, Harada hears Mari&#39;s voice and looks to see her slap his friend 
in the face. Harada&#39;s friend staggers back a step or two. Akko gets up 
and clings to Mari&#39;s arm, impressed with her friend&#39;s courage and 
strength, a bit surprised, and still shaken by the older guy&#39;s 
pushiness.  

Harada yells out &quot;Kumakura!&quot; and starts to run toward her, but meets his 
friends eyes as they recognize each other, and stops. His friend laughs 
and yells, &quot;So this is your innocent girlfriend, Harada?&quot;  

Mari turns sees that her so-called boyfriend is friends with the man who 
just made a move on Akko, and turns away, holding Akko by the hand and 
pulling her through the crowd.  

As the crush of people thins, Akko chimes in, &quot;Mari-chin - OW! I need to 
stop!&quot; She&#39;s got one geta on, and her foot looks pretty scratched up. 
Mari is crying in anger and frustration as the adrenaline wears off. Her 
expression softens as she looks at Akko.  

&quot;What do we do now?&quot; 

&quot;My house is nearby, and my mom is out of town again. Why don&#39;t you stay 
over?&quot; Akko says.  

Mari&#39;s heart speeds up, but she tries to keep a straight face. &quot;I&#39;ll 
have to call my mom first, though.&quot; 

Akko spaces out a bit while Mari is on the phone. Then Mari wails 
&quot;Whaaat?&quot; her face downcast. Akko tenses, looks worried.  

Mari smiles. &quot;Okay, mom. Thanks. See you in a bit.&quot;  

Akko looks puzzled. Mari explains, &quot;My mom didn&#39;t want me to stay with 
you without your mom there. So she said to come back home. Both of us!&quot; 

&quot;Uh, ok!&quot; Akko says, surprised. Then frowns, &quot;But Mari-chin, I thought 
your mom didn&#39;t like me because I don&#39;t have good manners or know how to 
dress properly.&quot;  

&quot;No, she doesn&#39;t, silly!&quot; Mari says. &quot;She knows you&#39;re my best friend. 
Hey, Akko, can you walk?&quot; she asks. Akko tries, but stumbles, so Mari, 
with Akko&#39;s arm over her shoulder, boosts her up to ride on her back.  

Akko is startled, thinks &quot;Mari-chin is strong!&quot; and rests her cheek on 
Mari&#39;s back, smiling.  

They get to the train station and Akko has to walk. Mari lets her down 
and says &quot;Next week, Akko-chan, we&#39;re going back on our diets!&quot; Mari 
steals a look at Akko pouting and smiles.  

They ride to Mari&#39;s neighborhood, and when they get home, enter quietly 
because everyone is asleep. Except there seems to be a bit of movement 
just out of the girls&#39; field of vision.  

There&#39;s a note for Mari inside the door. Mari&#39;s mom ran the bath for 
them before going to bed, it says. They read it together, and Mari looks 
at Akko, who is tired, shocked from the episode with Harada&#39;s friend, 
and beginning to sense how Mari feels, so she blushes, a look that Mari 
likes even more than her pout. 

As they go upstairs, Akko yawns and whispers &quot;We should probably take a 
bath together. Just to save time, you know?&quot; This time it&#39;s Mari&#39;s turn 
to blush.  

They go to the bathroom in their yukatas, and Akko stops Mari from 
undressing with a hand on her shoulder. &quot;Mari-chin, be honest!&quot; 

Mari freezes, her eyes wide.  

Akko, hands on hips - &quot;Did you know that guy at the festival?&quot;  

Mari looks down, &quot;No,&quot; she says, &quot;but I found something out about 
Harada.&quot; She meets Akko&#39;s eyes, &quot;That was Harada&#39;s friend, and I&#39;m never 
speaking to that...&quot;  

She starts to cry, and Akko reaches out to her, whispering in her ear, 
&quot;Mari, when you came over before your first date with him, and you said 
there was someone else you liked, who were you talking about?&quot;  

Mari wipes her tears away and in one motion undoes her yukata and stands 
up, letting it fall to the floor.
