<h1>Sasameki Koto: Legend of Akihabara</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../sasameki/index.html">Sasameki Koto</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<P>Azusa Aoi loved shopping in Akihabara and on Otome Road over in Ikebukuro, buying 
dojinshi and the occasional anime or drama CD as well as seeing the sights. Living where she 
did and going to school the dark haired girl felt isolated from the world of fandom, and it 
was invigorating to immerse herself into this fan dominated world. Here she could express 
her love for yuri through dojin and manga, search for more works by her favorite author 
Orino Masaka, and generally enjoy herself.</P><P>Azusa puffed out a tired breath as she 
hefted her bags, deciding on a whim to rest at a nearby maid cafe. The sweet young woman 
smiled warmly as Azusa entered, greeting her traditionally with, “Welcome home, 
master.”</P><P>With a comforted smile Azusa followed the black haired maid inside, the two 
walking to a table off to the side, sadly not near a window and by a table crowded with 
young ladies. “Busy day,” Azusa noted mildly.</P><P>“Very,” the maid agreed. “My name is 
Ritsuko. Would you care to start with some tea?” she offered.</P><P>“That'd be lovely,” 
Azusa said with a smile, pushing up her glasses.</P><P>As she settled herself down, Azusa 
found herself looking at the young women over at the nearby table. They were a interesting 
cross section of Akihabara girls, with several university students, a few that looked like 
otaku, some teens her own age and several kogal types with too much makeup. It seemed odd to 
see such a odd group together, and she found herself leaning in to hear them 
talk.</P><P>“... so all of us have experienced the same thing?” the slim, red haired 
university type noted. She frowned cutely, “I find that hard to believe.”</P><P>“It does 
make me feel a bit less special,” the blond haired kogal noted. “But when I saw the notice, 
I knew I had to come.”</P><P>“I'm glad you saw it,” the girl at the head of the table 
nodded, her black hair shimmering down her back as the high schooler noted, “I wouldn't have 
met some of you if we hadn't emailed.”</P><P>“So what are we going to call this little 
club?” the brown haired girl with glasses asked dryly, “The saved by karate girl 
club?”</P><P>'Saved by karate girl?' Azusa blinked as the maid arrived with her tea. “Thank 
you,” she smiled up at her from her seat. She blushed faintly as the maid bent over, the low 
cut dress showing the swell of her perfectly formed breasts....</P><P>“You're welcome,” 
Ritsuko winked. She looked over at the group of chattering girls and dropped her voice, “I 
hope they're not bothering you.”</P><P>“It's fine,” Azusa smiled reassuringly, “in fact I 
find it kind of interesting.”</P><P>Ritsuko gave her a sheepish glance as she sat across 
from her. “If I wasn't on shift I'd be joining their meeting,” she admitted as she took out 
her phone, “but at least I got a picture of her.”</P><P>The image on the camera phone's 
screen was a bit blurred by movement, but it was still a face that Azusa knew well. 
“Murasame-san?!” she yelped, seeing the familiar figure in a karate gi and without her 
squarish glasses.</P><P>“You know who she is!?” Ritsuko blurted out loudly as the girls from 
the other table crowded over to see what was going on.</P><P>In between giving the girls a 
summary of what she knew about her classmate and friend Sumika Murasame, Azusa got a idea 
why the girls were so into her. Apparently Murasame had been jogging through various parts 
of the city in her gi and rescuing damsels in distress. Literally. Listening to their 
stories it sounded like Murasame had stopped muggings, rapes, and other assaults with her 
usual casual capability. It was no wonder the girls were fans!</P><P>“So she's tall, dark, 
smart, a black belt and class president?” a kogal girl checked off some of  Murasame's 
positive traits with her heavily tanned fingers. “I think I'm in love.”</P><P>“Not all of us 
go that way,” Hotaru, the older of the university students giving her a look, her red hair 
and glasses giving her a studious look.</P><P>“More of her for me,” the other university 
girl offered, grinning. Minako looked at Azusa, “Any chance you could introduce me, Miss 
Aoi?”</P><P>“Ah...,” Azusa blanked as she tried to explain the whole Ushio/Sumika situation 
to them. “She's kind of seeing someone.”</P><P>“Too bad,” Ritsuko sighed. She noticed her 
boss looking harried and excused herself, “Gotta get back to work.”</P><P>“And you're all 
the women Murasame saved?” Azusa asked.</P><P>“Nah,” the leader, Shouko, answered with a 
chuckle, “there were a few others who couldn't make it today.” Shouko drank her tea as the 
group lingered and chatted, then gave Azusa a penetrating look as she quietly asked, “You 
like her, too?”</P><P>“I...,” Azusa felt herself blush as she looked away shyly, once again 
feeling the pain she had experienced when she realized Sumika was in love with 
another.</P><P>Shouko put her hand over Azusa's as she gently said, “I'm sorry, I shouldn't 
have pried.”</P><P>“It's okay,” Azusa managed a weak smile. “I was so overwhelmed by what we 
had in common....”</P><P>Noticing she had trailed off, Shouko looked up to see everyone 
listening in intently. “AHEM,” she cleared her throat loudly and they all looked 
away.</P><P>“Thanks,” Azusa smiled wryly. She looked down shyly as she confessed, “I sort of 
built things up in my head too fast.”</P><P>“I know how that feels,” Shouko agreed. She 
looked up at the group, “All right, folks. I think we can end todays meeting, but I'd like 
for us to get together next weekend. Okay?”</P><P>Several of the girls looked at each other 
warily, but there also was a lot of nodding of heads too. “Why not?” one of the kogals 
admitted, “This is kind of interesting.”</P><P>“Well, the meeting might be over,” Minako 
addressed a few of the others, “but there's no reason we can't stay for tea and 
lunch.”</P><P>The kogal blushed slightly, “Mind if I join you?”</P><P>Minako smiled, “Why 
not, indeed.”</P><P>As the girls scattered Shouko turned back to Azusa, “Miss Aoi, you 
mentioned Murasame-san is a fan of yuri, too?”</P><P>“She knows Orino Masaka, at least,” 
Azusa agreed eagerly, “she even recognized a quote from one of her rare works.”</P><P>“I 
like yuri too,” Shouko agreed, “but even I can't do that. Do you want to tell me about 
it?”</P><P>“Sure!” Azusa agreed as they fell into discussion, soon ordering more tea and 
cookies. The conversation ranged from stories to manga and dojin, both of them trading 
favorites and talking enthusiastically about the best series.</P><P>“I like Hidamari Sketch, 
too,” Shouko agreed at one point, “though I wish Miyabi Fujieda would do a art school 
series, too.”</P><P>“Does it bother you he's male?” Azusa had to ask.</P><P>“No,” Shouko 
shook her head, “as long as the stories are good.”</P><P>“True enough,” Azusa agreed. Her 
eyes strayed to her watch and she visibly paled as she yelped, “It's how 
late!?”</P><P>Shouko looked at the time herself and winced, “I'm late too.” She got up then 
hesitated as she pulled out her phone, “Miss Aoi?”</P><P>“Yes?” Azusa asked as she started 
collecting her bags.</P><P>“Could I have your number?” Shouko asked, blushing a 
bit.</P><P>Azusa looked at her in surprise, then she blushed too. “Yes, and I want your's 
too,” she said, deciding not to think too hard what it might mean. At the very least, she 
might be back here next week for the next meeting.</P><P>“See you next week?” Shouko asked 
as she walked her to the cafe door.</P><P>“Yes,” Azusa agreed firmly, giving her a shy smile 
as she left.</P>
