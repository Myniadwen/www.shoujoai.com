<pre>Warning: Spoilers for the show, although I am rearranging things as I 
want them for this story, some out-of-characterness and mention of m/m 
in passing. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We were the lost children. The ones born for no other reason than 
sacrifice; from the moment of our conception it was decided by those in 
charge that we were to be the shields and spears of the island. We were 
created the blood sacrifices for a peace that was a lie, a generation of 
fodder for a war we knew nothing about. 

That is not to say that we were unwanted, or at least not all of us. 
Some of us were blessed to have parents, or parent as the case might be, 
that loved us as best they were able. But it was understandable that the 
adults that knew our fate, while they fed us and clothed us as required, 
could not bear to form any deeper emotions for us. We were to be 
sacrificed after all, how much more painful would that not have been for 
them had they truly allowed themselves to love us? 

In this I was no more or less fortunate than most of the others. In my 
earliest childhood years I had both a father and a mother whom acted 
affectionately towards me, and a loving elder sister. Although my father 
never showed in word or deed to me the cruel and abusive man he became 
to my mother and sister back then, I still felt the disturbance keenly 
enough to still recall the discomfort of my home while father was 
around. The distance between the adults and my sister&#39;s anguish and 
impotent anger colour those memories in equal measure with the longing I 
felt for happier days that I now as an adult can barely remember.  

Then one day my father was gone, had left the island for places unknown 
to me. Home became more peaceful, and certainly both my mother and my 
sister were happier this way. I missed my father and clung to the 
memories of him, but I knew even back then not to show it as it would 
only bring pain to my sweet and loving sister, and to the mother I told 
myself I knew loved me even if she was always too busy for me. 

In essence, my mother kept her distance to me, and instead I was raised 
by my dear sister and the various teachers that were involved in our 
lives. Looking back now, armed with the knowledge my forced early 
adulthood brought, I know my father to have been a callous monster of a 
man, someone whose darkness nearly doomed us all. I also know my 
mother&#39;s distance was the result of her long and desperate struggle to 
save us all, all of the lost children of Alvis, out of a strong love not 
only for me but for all the children she had created. 

Yes. My mother, though not biologically, is in a way the mother of all 
the children of Tatsumiya island, for she is the one that has created 
us. I grew up knowing this of course, but what I did not know was what 
it meant to her; creating each new life hoping for the best yet knowing 
as few others could that for most of us, death was the kindest future. 
Knowing that the things she did to our growing bodies before our births 
would be our doom unless she could find a miracle. 

How many lives that she created and delivered into the world were 
eventually returned to her as corpses? Even now I do not know, only that 
of my own particular group there were not many; few left corpses behind. 

I wonder why it never occurred to any of us growing up that there was a 
very tangible gap in the world around us? Between the adults on the 
island and the children in school there was an emptiness that was not 
explained to us, there should have been young adults, older teens, at 
least a handful born in the intervening years, yet there were none. We 
watched as group after group of our immediate seniors supposedly left 
our shores at graduation, to make their way into the wider world the 
adults said, and we thought nothing of the fact that not one of them 
returned. Of my sister&#39;s age-group there are a rare few that remain, and 
between hers and mine, none. One way or the other, all those children 
died in the war. 

There was an event that in a strange way I believe changed everything. 
It happened while we were all still so small, still so innocent and 
ignorant of the world we lived in. Of the ones that were directly 
involved in what happened, only I remain now to tell about it. 

It was the summer we were seven, and we ran around unsupervised in our 
small childish adventures. Who could have known what would happen? 

It was myself, Kazuki-kun, Minashiro-kun, Kasugai-kun and... Shouko. 
Back then the boys were Kazu-chan, Sou-chan and Kyou-chan, regretfully 
the years that followed changed that closeness, and the politeness of 
the adult world intruded. Either way, that summer Kazuki-kun had been 
playing with some parts for a transceiver radio, and while he fiddled 
with the repairs a voice had sounded among the static. 

I recall how excited we were, and how proud Kazuki-kun was of his 
repairs... Sakura was going to come with us as we were going to try to 
send a message to the voice together, but she was called away at last 
moment. The rest of us were there, on that remote hill, when Kazuki-kun 
turned the radio on, and among the static a female-sounding voice 
clearly called out to us. 

&quot;Are you there?&quot; 

As agreed upon we were all going to call out the answer when 
Minashiro-kun pressed the button, however he was too fast for the rest 
of us and his voice alone rang clear into the radio. What followed was a 
nightmare for our innocent selves. The radio crackled and Minashiro-kun 
started screaming, horrible, terrible screams while he convulsed, his 
back arching and his eyes wide open and staring at the sky. For months 
afterwards I would hear those screams in my haunted dreams, and yet that 
was not the last of it. 

Kazuki-kun, probably thinking Minashiro-kun was being electrocuted, 
yanked his friend away and gave the machine an impressive kick of his 
tiny foot, smashing the receiver. Minashiro-kun slumped over but did not 
stop screaming for a while, I think both I and Shouko reached out to him 
but he pushed us away. The sounds he made when he stopped screaming were 
somehow even worse, and when he straightened up Minashiro-kun... 

He looked so frightening, with that mad expression and a wild look in 
his eyes that had changed colour, one of them becoming a horribly 
inhuman gold. Shouko crawled over to me and clung to me, but 
Minashiro-kun saw neither of us. Instead he stared at Kazuki-kun, and in 
a frightening voice he kept asking that question, the same one the voice 
on the radio had. &quot;Are you there?&quot; 

He reached towards Kazuki-kun with something long and green-glowing 
growing out of his hand. I don&#39;t know which one of us screamed, if it 
was Shouko or I, but he turned towards us with that thing, aiming it at 
Shouko. Kasugai-kun grabbed him, yelling that he was scaring Shouko, but 
Minashiro-kun shoved him away so hard that Kasugai-kun went flying. 
Kazuki-kun tried to stop him then, and there was a scuffle between the 
boys. I was honestly never quite sure what happened as I couldn&#39;t see 
past Shouko&#39;s head, I just know Minashiro-kun tried to kill Kazuki-kun 
while saying those words over and over. Then suddenly as Kazuki-kun was 
down, trapped against the base of the big tree with Minashiro-kun 
standing over him, something happened and Minashiro-kun rammed that 
green-glowing thing right into his own eye. 

There was so much blood and screaming, and Minashiro-kun was on the 
ground clutching his eye as the blood poured out, wailing in pain and 
sobbing that he was sorry. Kazuki-kun was in shock and wouldn&#39;t move, so 
I vaguely remember yelling at Kasugai-kun to run and get help from the 
adults before I took off my thin summer jacket, balled it up and pressed 
it to Minashiro-kun&#39;s head. He sort of crawled into my lap as I did, and 
I sat there for what felt like forever, cradling Minashiro-kun while 
trying to stop the bleeding and talking to him to keep him calm as we 
waited for mother to arrive. 

Looking back I wonder, why did we never question what happened? I cannot 
recall ever getting a single explanation for the green crystal-like 
things growing out of Minashiro-kun&#39;s hand, or why he went crazy and 
tried to kill Kazuki-kun. We were told not to talk about what had 
happened, and we did not. Kazuki-kun and Minashiro-kun were no longer 
best friends, and Minashiro-kun lost the use of his eye, but other than 
that it was as if that event never took place. 

From speaking with my mother I now know that from that exposure to the 
Festum contaminant we, all of us save Minashiro-kun whose fate was more 
complicated, were slotted for piloting the Fafners for certain. Our 
genetic specifications were the base used for the work on the interface 
system for the Nothung-series Fafners, even though they were a long time 
from becoming workable at that point. Also the attacks on the island 
changed that day, up until that point Festum encounters were random, by 
chance... after what happened the Festum were aware that we were out 
there, and actively came searching for us. Does that make it our fault, 
the five children on that hill? All those deaths that would follow... 
then again, we paid for it, didn&#39;t we? And ultimately it was this group 
of children and their friends that bought the state of peace that 
humanity now enjoys. 

The price was high though. They are all gone now, Minashiro-kun, 
Kasugai-kun, Kazuki-kun and Shouko, only I remain. 

Minashiro-kun was assimilated by an enemy Festum until not even ashes 
remained of him, though until his last day Kazuki-kun swore they would 
meet again. Kasugai-kun was a victim of Festum assimilation from his 
work as a pilot, and despite efforts to stop it he became a MIR, 
although a thinking, feeling MIR that was our ally. He is still out 
there somewhere, I know, but he has left his humanity behind. Kazuki-kun 
was also taken over by the heavy toll the fighting had claimed, from the 
Assimilation Disease that takes our bodies from exposure to the Fafners 
we pilot. By then my mother had developed the cure as per Makabe Akane&#39;s 
instructions, but Kazuki-kun... to be honest I think Kazuki-kun lacked 
the will to live any longer. He told me that he was going to be with 
Minashiro-kun again, and that same day he boarded his Fafner never to 
return. 

Then there was Shouko. My brave, gentle, precious Shouko. 

Objectively speaking, despite my love for my mother and sister, I would 
say that Shouko had the good fortune to receive the best parent of all 
of us. Hazama Youko was always, in her position of teacher besides being 
Shouko&#39;s mother, a solid presence in all our lives growing up, and there 
was not a single one among us that did not adore the woman. I who had 
even more contact with aunt Youko, being both Shouko&#39;s best friend and 
the daughter and sister of the island&#39;s doctor and nurse, have always 
felt particularly grateful that it was she who was given Shouko to 
raise. Shouko was always so frail, so fragile, and while her heart was 
ever strong and loving her body just could not hold up. Aunt Youko loved 
and supported Shouko every step of the way... she was never just raising 
a future pilot, aunt Youko was raising her precious only child. 

Why did we bond so tightly, Shouko and I? I&#39;ll never really know, only 
that the closeness that we shared went beyond that of best friends, 
although I cannot really put it into words I would say that she was the 
most important part of me. I loved her dearly and sincerely, and for 
those last handful months before the end it happened that I also fell in 
love with her. 

Shouko never needed to be told of my emotions to know them, just as I 
never needed to be told that she in turn had fallen for Kazuki-kun, we 
both just knew and accepted things as they were. She never blamed me nor 
treated me differently for the feelings I held, and I would always have 
been the person rooting for her happiness, no matter whom she found it 
with. 

When she gave her life to protect us all, I couldn&#39;t bear it. I thought 
I couldn&#39;t live without her, and the pain was so beyond anything I could 
begin to describe... but I realised also that I could not let her down, 
that I had to be as strong as I could be, do what I could do, in her 
memory. So I tried to keep our little group together, to watch over the 
boys that she had loved and that had loved her, in her place. 

Yes, so very much of all I did since her death was because of Shouko. I 
would have fought to the very last breath for any one of them even 
without having lost her first, but now I felt the need, the obligation, 
to do it for both of us. And whether ultimately I succeeded or failed, I 
tried. 

How it burned me when I was told that I was too defective to become a 
pilot, when I had to helplessly sit by the sidelines unable to help as 
people I cared about where out there, fighting for far more than their 
lives against such horror. The others wanted away from the horror and 
the battlefield, it seemed I alone desperately wished to be allowed in. 
To make matters even worse, it was while rescuing myself and my senpai, 
Mizoguchi-kun, that Kasugai-kun was... lost. Sakura&#39;s brave effort saved 
him from complete assimilation into the Festum he had fought, but what 
we managed to bring back to Alvis was no longer human. We agreed all 
though not with words, that this was a fate much worse than death as we 
watched what remained of him locked away in stasis for my mother to 
examine. 

Should I have been bitter, later when it became apparent to us that 
although no longer human, Kasugai-kun was still alive, still enough 
himself to love and grieve and protect? Should I have regretted that out 
of those of us faced with assimilation or death, Shouko alone had the 
courage to self-destruct, yet of those that had faced that choice Shouko 
alone could not ever return? Perhaps aunt Youko wrestled with those 
thoughts as well, although I would not bring up such a painful subject. 
If nothing else I like to think that in the end it all proved just what 
true strength and courage Shouko had, even if she is missed. 

There were others lost forever as well, of course, like Kodate-kun that 
also lost his life in combat, and oh so many others before and since. I 
imagine Shouko is anything but lonely, over there on the other side, 
perhaps sparing a moment to watch over us from time to time. Perhaps, if 
she does, she will be pleased to see that the island still stands and 
hers and all the others&#39; sacrifices were not for nothing. 

Perhaps one day she will even forgive me. 

After Kasugai-kun was placed in stasis, my sister&#39;s misguided attempt at 
saving my life by changing my Fafner compatibility test results were 
revealed with my father&#39;s return to the island. It became such a big, 
and for me emotional, mess, the who, when and why of it all. Although I 
might have wished that I could have held onto my few happy memories of 
my father, rather than so thoroughly get exposed to the true heartless 
creature that he was, I am still rather grateful that during all of this 
I was given the chance to see my father one last time before he died. It 
only shames me so painfully much that it was through him that the Festum 
learned hate, and thus became so much more determined to see to the 
destruction of everything in existence. 

At the end of the day though, as the dust settled from our sadly human 
enemies&#39; departure, I was not only a Fafner pilot but the sniper ace as 
well. By now it doesn&#39;t matter what kind of projectile weapon is placed 
in my hands, or whether I am inside my Fafner or not; I cannot miss my 
target. For all this strength and skill however, I failed Shouko.  

I could not prevent Kodate-kun&#39;s death even though I was there. I could 
do nothing for Sakura when the Assimilation Disease claimed her as well. 
Although I tried so hard and fought so much, I could not prevent so many 
lives that were lost on the island...  and most of all, I could not stop 
the Festum from taking Minashiro-kun. We all fought so insanely hard to 
take him back, but although we might have won the day and saved humanity 
&#150; at least for now &#150; we could not save him. That failure meant that I 
could also not save the boy Shouko had loved, when Kazuki-kun finally 
gave in to the Assimilation Disease in his yearning to be with the one 
he loved again. 

I understood and could not blame him, but that does not change the fact 
that I failed. 

In the wake of the mess with my father&#39;s brief return to the island and 
the Neo UN attacking us, we were given unexpected additions to our 
island in the abandoned enemy soldiers that chose to join us, and Fafner 
pilots Kanon and Michio. Michio was something so extremely rare as one 
of the sacrificial children that had survived long enough to return 
home, now a young adult bordering on being too old to pilot a Fafner any 
longer. As things turned out he was also my sister&#39;s long-lost love, his 
return allowing them to pick back up what had been forcibly abandoned 
years ago. They were determined to have a future, to beat the odds and 
start a family once his fighting days were over. 

Although it saddens me to know that they never had that chance, that 
even that one returning sacrificial child lost his life protecting this 
island, it also fills me and so many others with hope as Michio and my 
sister did what had been impossible for descendants of Japan for decades 
and created a child together. This child, this beautiful little niece of 
mine, will never be a sacrificial lamb for whatever cause. The people of 
Alvis have agreed on this, but even if they had not, I would do whatever 
was necessary to make sure of it. This child will never be lost. 

I doubt I need to worry much about my tiny niece&#39;s safety though. As 
unexpected as it was, one of the most powerful creatures to currently 
inhabit this island is well on her way of becoming little Michiru&#39;s 
other parent. Any creature that would lay hand on this little girl would 
surely have to answer to Sakura. 

When my mother finally managed to inject Sakura with a strong enough 
dose of the cure for the Assimilation Disease that it showed results, 
Sakura was taken out of the stasis chamber she had been kept in and 
woken up. With the exception of her eyes, once so dark and now the red 
that marks Fafner use or the Assimilation Disease, she looked the same 
as ever. She knew the people around her and responded emotionally to her 
mother and her would-be boyfriend although she seemed understandably 
subdued, and best of all although the island sensors declared her 
readings those of a MIR rather than a human, she was not labelled a 
threat. It became apparent rather quickly though that Sakura was not 
quite the same person as before, she was far more restrained and serious 
in ways my rambunctious tomboy of a friend had just never been before. 

It was also apparent that she was not like Kasugai-kun whom had lost his 
humanity, no matter how her personality seemed changed, and we were all 
advised to give her time and opportunity to re-evaluate herself and her 
relationships. From a personal point of view, she was still Sakura, just 
noticeably calmer and quieter than before, and I had no problem 
reconnecting to her as she now was. Neither had my family, our friends 
or Sakura&#39;s mother, whom I suspect was far too grateful that not only 
had her daughter been returned but also returned a lot less reckless 
than before to be bothered by a pair of red eyes. Not so for Kondou-kun. 

For the boy and fellow pilot that had tentatively begun the process of 
getting romantically involved with Sakura before the Assimilation 
Disease struck, the situation became too awkward. He could not make 
peace with the changes in her, and she could not seem to muster much 
interest for him, leading to a cooling of their friendship until they 
were as mere casual acquaintances despite the fact that Sakura&#39;s mother 
had taken Kondou-kun into her home. 

Uncomfortable around this friend turned stranger and foster brother, 
Sakura spent more and more time with my sister whom welcomed the 
company. The two of them had been surprisingly good friends before, but 
gradually this bond grew stronger, until they were all but inseparable. 
Sakura doted on my sister, and once she was born, even more so with my 
niece. Whether the two of them noticed it initially or not, it was clear 
to us all that Sakura was head over heels for both mother and daughter, 
and she and my sister had taken to a kind of semi-flirty semi-couple-y 
behaviour that was only too cute to behold.  

It wasn&#39;t until the true reason behind why Sakura no longer seemed able 
to synchronise into the piloting system of the Fafners was revealed that 
things came to a conclusion with her and my sister, as if Sakura had 
known about the hidden change in her and been afraid of Yumiko&#39;s 
reaction. Although I was present for what happened I was inside my 
Fafner, located on a far away hilltop with a rifle aimed at my childhood 
friend for the duration of it, and as such I never found out what was 
actually said. I watched as my mother and sister spoke to Sakura at 
length, until finally Sakura walked some distance away from the two of 
them and... changed. I did not get to see Kasugai-kun&#39;s MIR form, but I 
was told he was enormous and glowing blue. Sakura&#39;s new shape was 
likewise enormous but glowing a pale purple, and as startlingly 
beautiful as the Festum appears at first glance. 

When Sakura changed back to her human shape, she was crying and hugging 
herself. It didn&#39;t take Yumiko long to run over to Sakura and grab onto 
her, wiping at her face as they appeared to be speaking. I rather think 
my sister was as surprised as mother and I when in the midst of this 
comforting she simply leaned in and gave Sakura a long, intense kiss. 
Both women looked terribly embarrassed afterwards, not to mention that 
my mother&#39;s teasing probably did not make things easier on them, but at 
least they still walked hand in hand back to the lab. Days of testing 
followed, but in time Sakura was declared stable enough, safe enough, to 
join us Fafner pilots for combat training in her new form. My future 
sister-in-law is powerful indeed, yet I think we are probably all rather 
glad that she prefers not to use this shape when she can avoid it. 

So. All around me people began to work for the future, to have hopes and 
dreams for tomorrow after such a long time of merely trying to live out 
the day. Whether or not the Festum truly are gone for good we cannot 
know, but careful optimism began colouring life on this island from a 
certain point on. 

At times I think that I alone am looking to the past. Then again, I was 
not supposed to survive this long. 

My quirky friend and senpai Mizoguchi claims that I am carrying the 
ghosts of comrades lost, and the weight of battles fought. He told me 
this is the surviving soldier&#39;s lot, that the trick was to find 
something in the now worth living for, something more than the fighting. 
He considers me as seasoned a war veteran as himself now, who would have 
thought that? I could see the truth in what he told me, but there was 
something else as well that troubled me and that was something I 
couldn&#39;t really talk to him about. 

It was the other way in which I believed failed Shouko.  

Shouko was my everything. I loved her long before I ever fell in love 
with her, and she was a part of me. Although I am my own woman now, a 
change forced upon me by necessity, there is a part of me where she will 
always be, and no-one could ever take her place. Or so I thought. 

There is a person whose arrival at the island I paid not nearly enough 
attention to at first, although by the time I found out where and with 
whom she had been assigned, I set out to correct that mistake. 

Kanon Memphis. Dublin-born former Fafner-pilot for the enemy, lost her 
family, her friends and her country all to the Festum before Michio 
saved her. The perfect soldier really, skilled at what she does and 
blindly obedient, or at least she was until events stranded her here on 
this island. Gaining her own will and finding the strength to make her 
own decisions have been a slow but successful process with her, although 
it is hard work to get her to step outside her soldier persona. 

Beautiful Kanon of blood-red hair, serious blue eyes, and possibly the 
cutest lost-puppy look known to mankind. 

I am ashamed to say that my initial reaction to hearing where and with 
whom Kanon had been placed was to question, quietly agonized, if aunt 
Youko had given her Shouko&#39;s room to stay in. I should have known 
better, after all I loved the woman all the more for her adamant refusal 
to accept any new sacrificial child to raise, for how she had told my 
mother and the others that there would never be any replacement for her 
one and only beloved daughter, for her Shouko. Few if any of the other 
parents would have been that determined or devoted. 

Kanon was not Shouko&#39;s replacement, but the decision to house the girl 
with Youko had been taken by our superiors without input from Youko 
herself. I know though that once aunt Youko heard the heartbreaking 
story of this orphan child, she could not help but to open both her home 
and her heart to Kanon. It was something they had in common, Shouko and 
her mother, that caring kindness. 

I felt guilty for my assumption when Kanon hastened to assure me that 
she had not been given Shouko&#39;s room, and I promised myself to do better 
towards her from then on. My next meeting with Kanon further broke my 
heart though, as I caught a glimpse of her in the background and mistook 
her for Shouko herself. 

Youko had given Kanon Shouko&#39;s clothes, only the many unused ones that 
Shouko had not gotten the chance to wear herself, but still, the cut of 
the dresses and the choice of summer hats... they were so Shouko to me 
it drove a knife into my heart. 

I tried my best not to let it show, and with Sakura&#39;s help I got Kanon 
to join us, not only that day but for many other small get-togethers 
that we arranged in between battles and training as well. Most of us 
took a liking to Kanon as soon as we started to get to know her. She is 
quite the contradiction, on one side so tomboyish as to put the boys to 
shame, blunt to the point of rude without meaning to, and terribly 
capable, still the other side of her is quite feminine, fragile, shy and 
unsure, desperately wanting friends and a mother&#39;s affection. She was 
not a replacement for Shouko, and Youko might have declared that Shouko 
was her only daughter at one time, but it could not be helped. The 
childless mother with boundless love to give bonded with the orphaned 
child that desperately needed someone to love her, and before Youko knew 
it, she had a shy but devoted second daughter. She could not help but to 
love this child as well. 

It frightened me to find that I also did. 

It crept up on me unnoticed in all that was going on, how I enjoyed her 
company and given half a chance, and no other duties to perform, I would 
seek her out. I thought I came by the house simply to help Kanon settle 
in on the island, because it was the right thing to do, but although 
that might have been true to begin with it wasn&#39;t the reason later on. I 
just liked her. 

The awareness hit me suddenly one morning that should have been quite 
mundane: I had come to pick Kanon up to walk to school with her, and I 
moved through the house with my usual familiarity having practically 
grown up there myself. Youko peeked out from the kitchen to smile at me 
in greeting, making a funny but very familiar little gesture to show me 
where Kanon was as she chatted away about school.  

The familiarity of that scene hit me so hard my legs buckled. How many 
mornings had been exactly the same, only it had not been Kanon I was 
there to pick up, but Shouko? 

It was not just the surroundings, the scene that was the same I 
realized, that kernel of happy and contented warmth in me was the same 
as well. Kanon came in and my heart jumped in response... and I, who 
have seen so much battle, bloodshed and death while keeping my 
composure, I burst into tears. 

Aunt Youko sent the worried Kanon out to tend the dog while she sat down 
and held me until the tears had passed. She was so understanding, aunt 
Youko, and talked to me for a long time about how caring for Kanon did 
not mean that we loved Shouko any less, and how she was sure that Shouko 
would have loved her little sister as well. It did not solve what was 
brewing in me, but that talk calmed me enough to get my composure back 
around Kanon. And I know she was right, Shouko would surely have adored 
Kanon. 

As we made our way down the hill, late but still determined to get to 
school, Kanon was quite pensive. For her being rather subdued was and is 
not particularly out of the ordinary, but when alone with me she tends 
to be quite a bit more talkative, and the glances she sent my way during 
our walk spoke volumes all by themselves. I could not in good conscience 
pretend I did not notice, so I stopped and intended to explain myself. 

Kanon not only beat me to it, but she had quite an outpouring as well. 
She looked so sad when she told me how she knew she wasn&#39;t Shouko, that 
she couldn&#39;t replace her and how she knew I wished Shouko was here 
instead. With shiny, averted eyes and a slightly trembling pout she told 
me that if I wanted her to, if it was easier for me that way, she would 
go away. 

I am only a mortal woman after all, so I could not help but to pounce on 
her. I hugged her as hard as I dared while my mouth was running free 
without any input of my brain as I tried to find the words to reassure 
her. I wanted her to know beyond any doubt that although I missed Shouko 
and would still need to cry over her on rare occasion, Kanon herself was 
also dear and irreplaceable to me. Even as I spoke I realized just how 
true that was, and hugged her tighter &#150; I could not bear the thought of 
losing Kanon now. 

She hugged me back, and the hug was like her: strong, compact, warm... 
and so very comfortable. Something in me wistfully thought of Shouko, 
the friendly hugs we&#39;d share, and how small and fragile she had been to 
hold. It had been like holding a baby bird, always checking oneself so 
that nothing got broken. Hugging Kanon was nothing like that, she was 
still feminine and soft, true, but she was also solid rippling muscle, 
she would not break no matter how much I clung to her; she only hugged 
back stronger still. 

It was a good metaphor for these two, I realized then, on the outside 
Shouko was weak and fragile, yet inside she was fearless, the strongest 
one of all of us, while in Kanon&#39;s case it was the reverse. On the 
outside Kanon was strong and solid, but inside was a fragile, confused 
and hurting girl that could easily be wounded by careless words. 

I kissed her then, right there on the road down the hill, I leaned in 
and pressed my lips to hers without any conscious thought. It lasted 
only for the briefest of moments as voices were calling for us, and the 
shock when I realised what I had done nearly sent me careening over the 
handrail. Fortunately for me we were whisked away to the command centre 
before either of us had the chance to react, and were pushed through the 
swiftest and shortest of briefings before rushed to our Fafners and put 
on combat standby. 

To my relief it was not a Festum attack that had things in an uproar, 
although the sudden arrival of Neo UN&#39;s battleships on a fast approach 
to our island was not much better. What followed was a tense week of 
constant and vigilant duty as our former enemies of the human kind were 
present at the island to draw up a peace treaty. At the end of the week 
these visitors returned from where they had come, the relations between 
the Neo UN and our island no less strained than before and certainly no 
friendlier, but at least the treaties had been agreed upon and signed.  

For weeks after this I avoided being alone with Kanon, giving us no 
chance to talk about what I had done, before I finally caved in. I had 
to face up to the fact that for me history had repeated itself, I had 
made a best friend and then fallen utterly in love with her. Unlike the 
case with Shouko, I was not completely certain that my chances were 
absolute nil, although every time my thoughts strayed that far the guilt 
would overwhelm me and keep me from speculating further. 

Guilt was my biggest problem. I felt that I was betraying Shouko with 
these feelings I had for Kanon, and the guilt of that was eating away at 
me. I could not say how obvious what was going on with me truly was to 
my surroundings at the time, just that eventually aunt Youko asked me to 
take a walk with her. 

It was a long walk in more senses than one, and we both said a lot of 
things we can&#39;t really say to anyone else, about love and loss and... 
Shouko. She knew what was troubling me, perhaps even better than I did, 
and was so very supportive and understanding. It hit me again, that old 
gratitude that someone this good, this caring, was the parent of the one 
so dear to me. Only this time my thoughts were of Kanon. 

Aunt Youko talked sense into me. She made me see that my guilt was 
misplaced, that the Shouko we had both loved so would never hold our 
feelings for Kanon against us. If anything Shouko would have been happy 
for me if I could find someone that made me happy. 

Our walk ended by her grave which we tended to together, sharing a few 
memories of Shouko as a little girl. I felt better than I had in a long 
time. It was there I made the conscious decision to let Shouko go, 
whether Kanon really felt anything for me or not. I sent my thoughts 
like a prayer to her, asking her to please forgive me and be happy for 
me, then I hugged aunt Youko, thanking her for everything. Aunt Youko 
smiled and told me to go ahead, she would stay a while longer before 
heading back. 

I turned around and I ran as if my life depended on it, stopping only 
briefly to buy a flower before setting off running again. I ran all the 
way up the hill to the Hazama family home and, before I had taken the 
time to catch my breath much less thought about what to say or do, 
knocked on the door. 

She was there, standing just inside the door wearing those cute blue 
overalls and looking confused at first, then adorably shy as she 
accepted the flower I offered along with a rambling and slightly panting 
apology. The slow smile she gave me in return reached in and claimed me 
whole right there. I hoped that Shouko would indeed give me her blessing 
from wherever she was, because when Kanon reached out to take my hand 
and lead me inside while smiling like that, I knew that I was going to 
love Kanon with everything I had. 

Despite what one might have thought, ours was a slow romance. We took 
the time to do things right, partly because despite my determination it 
took time to lay my guilt-demons to rest, but mostly because she 
deserved to take her time. I never regretted a single moment spent in 
her company and I never will, come what may. 

I still do not look to the future, although surprisingly sometimes she 
does. She wonders if the two of us could get qualified for children one 
day, after we have married and live together. She blushes prettily as 
she says these things while we are wrapped in each other&#39;s arms, her 
skin so warm and perfect against mine. I am not the only one who has 
found life and meaning outside of the fighting in what we have, and with 
this she has discovered that she wants us to have our own family 
someday.  

It is a pleasant thought, and perhaps it will be so one day. I leave the 
plans to her, simply happy to be in the now, anchored here by her. In 
this future she and others now envision, the future that is slowly being 
built, maybe there will be no sacrificial children. No children born 
simply to endure such horror and pain in their short lives, and then 
die. Maybe my generation can truly be the last of this island&#39;s lost 
children. 

I hope so. And as for me? I breathe her in, run my fingers through her 
hair and marvel at the emotions that fill me. 

I am here. I am alive. And I am no longer lost. </pre>
