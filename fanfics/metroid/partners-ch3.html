<h1>Partners (part 3 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../metroid/index.html">Metroid Prime</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dak.html">Dak</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../metroid/partners-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>I&#39;ll show her, I can be strong, just like her. That&#39;s what Zelda had 
said before she left that day. But training is harder than it looks. She 
could cheat using her male form, but she wasn&#39;t opt for cheating. She 
wanted her natural strength. She had bought a small, one person, 
lightspeed ship, and a room at an apartment on a planet she could never 
remember the name of. She had acquired a job as a chef at a moderate 
japanese restaurant. She was only a few days into work, and already a 
favorite employee. Her cooking skills had improved very quickly. She was 
also learning a bit of sword play from a newfound friend named Rei. She 
was a Japanese girl who was short, but extremely pretty, with long black 
hair, and an eye for flaws.

Right now though, Zelda was in the gym, lifting weights, trying to 
become stronger.

&quot;Well Zelda, you certainly didn&#39;t seem like the type who pumped iron 
like those gents.&quot; a training instructor pointed to a group of muscle 
bulging men.

&quot;I guess. Well, I have my motivations.&quot; She replied, grabbing her bar. 
She leaned back and started again. The instructor leaned over to see her 
face.

&quot;Are you trying to set a world record or something. You work way harder 
than even some guys.&quot;

&quot;I want to participate in that tournament that&#39;s coming up. I&#39;m nowhere 
near tough enough.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll say. You&#39;re only lifting 100 pounds.&quot;

Zelda stopped and glared at the instructor. He smiled and cocked his 
head to the side, and sipped a drink he had. Zelda resumed work.

&quot;One tip though, try wearing sweatpants instead of a dress.&quot; He said, 
looking at her. A clank of metal and Zelda sat up.

&quot;Do they have sweatskirts?&quot; She asked. His response was to laugh loudly, 
leaning his head back and smiling to his ears. Zelda hated when people 
laughed like that.

&quot;Hey! Here you are. I&#39;ve been looking everywhere for you.&quot; A new voice. 
Zelda looked to where it came from and saw Rei running towards her, a 
bag of something in her hand. She stopped in front of the two and 
panted, leaning on her knees. She stood straight, bowed to the 
instructor, and then faced Zelda.

&quot;Hi.&quot; Zelda said.

&quot;Hi there. Hungry? I got some food. Hee hee, but it&#39;s from one of our 
rival restaurants.&quot; Rei grinned, eyes closed. She had a habit of doing 
that, the food part.

&quot;You know you&#39;ll get busted if you&#39;re caught with that. Do you ever eat 
from our restaurant?&quot; Zelda asked.

&quot;Yes. When I&#39;m working. I don&#39;t hate our food, especially not your 
cooking. But I like to try different stuff. Wanna come to our apartment 
and eat?&quot;

Zelda sat there, looked up at the instructor, and let out a big sigh.

&quot;Sure, let&#39;s go.&quot; Zelda got up and bowed to the instructor, as well as 
Rei. He bowed back, and left them.

&quot;You must be pooped.&quot; Rei said as they walked out.

Back at their apartment they sat down at their table, a low, oriental 
style table. Zelda had to get used to these tables, they were everywhere 
in this city. Rei pulled the food out of the bag and spread it out at 
the table.

&quot;Alright, let&#39;s chow!&quot; Rei was always excited about something.

&quot;Hold on a moment.&quot; Zelda said, sniffing the food. Rei was stopped in 
mid-dive. Zelda pulled her head back and thought a moment.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong? Don&#39;t tell me YOU found something wrong. I already made 
them re-make it three times.&quot;

&quot;It needs something.&quot; Zelda replied. She grabbed all the food and ran to 
the kitchen.

&quot;HEY wait a minute!&quot; Rei jumped up, but it was too late. Zelda was 
already cooking the food again to improve it.

about 2 minutes later Zelda brought the food back to the table. It was 
steaming, and emanating a mouth watering smell.

&quot;Here, try this.&quot; Zelda handed a piece of original food to Rei, who ate 
it... right out of Zelda&#39;s hand, which surprised Zelda a moment.

&quot;Mm-hmm.&quot; She observed, munching away. Zelda smiled. Then handed a piece 
of her own improved food.

&quot;Now try this.&quot; She said. Rei almost repeated her previous approach, but 
Zelda stopped her. Rei picked it up and ate it.

&quot;Well?&quot; Zelda sked. It took Rei a moment to respond...

.. but when she did, tears began to flow like streams from her closed 
eyes. She was smiling away, and hands clasped together. Zelda kind of 
stared at her, and was not expecting the big hug that followed.

&quot;You can&#39;t believe how good this is. You HAVE to try it.&quot;

With that the two of them inhaled the food.

They lay on the floor, a hand over their stomachs, and a smile across 
their faces. They had eaten every last morsel, and loved it all.

It took her a while, but eventually Zelda sat up, full.

&quot;Okay, that was good. I told you my cooking was better than any 
other&#39;s.&quot; Zelda said. She had almost turned around to face Rei, when she 
found Rei&#39;s arms wrapped around her from behind.

&quot;Actually, I said that. And I mean it. You&#39;re cooking IS good.&quot; Rei told 
her softly, a smile still on her face.

&quot;Rei? You&#39;re scaring me.&quot; Zelda replied.

&quot;Oh. Oops, sorry.&quot; Rei&#39;s arms flew off of Zelda and Rei sat back.

That was... odd. Zelda thought.

Samus had promised to train for the tournament, and had prepared for 
training. She however, was not training. She was drifting. Her ship had 
run out of fuel and was floating aimlessly though space.

&quot;Why didn&#39;t I stop and refuel. I passed a perfectly good station, THREE 
minutes before this happened. Why did this happen to me?&quot;

She was sitting in her chair, fiddling with her pen. Her computer was 
sending out occasional distress signals, hoping to the gods that 
someone, ANYone would pick it up, and come to her rescue.

To have to be rescued by someone else, especially a man, would be one of 
her worst nightmares. It would be something she had to endure though, if 
she wanted to get out of this. She looked out the window and saw a blue 
planet passing by, or rather, she was passing by IT. She saw multiple 
spots, which where objects in the atmosphere, probably other ships 
entering. She was appearantly too far for them to pick her signal up.

To pass time, Samus decided to do searches on her computer. She logged 
onto her computer, and found she had mail. It was all junk mail, 
advertisements and such, except for one, from the tournament staff.

&quot;Let&#39;s see. &#39;Samus Aran, thank you for joining this year&#39;s tournament. 
We regrett to inform you that it has been... POSTPONED!?&quot; Samus yelled. 
She read on. &quot; We have had some trouble with the staff and, disputes, 
but it should be sorted out soon. We expect the situation to return to 
normal in a week and a half. The tournement is postponed to two weeka 
later, at earliest. We will contact you again when the date has been 
verified. Thank you, the Management.&#39;&quot; Samus sat back in her chair, 
groaning.

&quot;At least I have more time to train now. What kind of bonus is that?&quot;

Her intercom beeped. Samus looked at it, and finally pressed the button.

&quot;Chu!?&quot; was heard.

&quot;What?&quot; Samus replied. A picture of a Pichu appeared on screen. He was 
wearing green goggles over his eyes.

&quot;Chu chu pi-chu!&quot;

&quot;Hold on a moment. I&#39;ll turn on the translator.&quot; She flipped a switch 
and pressed some buttons.

&quot;Samus? Is that you?&quot; the Pichu asked.

&quot;Yeah. It&#39;s me.&quot; Samus mumbled, wishing eagerly for a man to come and 
rescue her instead.

&quot;Your ship was sending distress signals. Are you alright?&quot;

&quot;Are there any other ships around?&quot;

&quot;Um...&quot; checking his radar, &quot;Nope. None on my scanners. Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;I need a pickup. Preferably a refuel right here.&quot; Samus groaned.

&quot;No can do on refuel, but I can get you to a nearby station in a jip.&quot; 
the Pichu jumped from board to board on his console, rapidly typing in 
commands.

&quot;Okay, just do it fast.&quot; Samus leaned back in her chair. She saw a 
larger ship move over hers from behind. She felt a jolt as the tractor 
beam grabbed her ship. She was carried up, and then locked into place by 
electromagnets.

&quot;Hold on tight, this&#39;ll be quite a jump.&quot; Pichu announced. Samus grabbed 
onto her seat, and they shot forward. Samus felt a long stretch in her 
body as the ship entered a jump. A station appeared in front of them in 
seconds.

Silence was about for a minute while Pichu negotiated an entrance. They 
flew into the hangar a moment later, and Pichu guided Samus&#39;s ship into 
a platform, and the systems locked her in place.

Samus stepped out and looked around.

&quot;Oh no. No no no. Any other station, it had to be this one.&quot; Samus 
realized that this was the station where she had left... her. She tried 
to forget her, but now she remembered again. She turned her head and 
closed her eyes tight.

I&#39;m going to forget all about this. I&#39;m going to get a resupply and get 
out of here.

&quot;Pi? Chu pi?&quot; Pichu came up behind her. Samus turned around, confused.

&quot;You know, I can&#39;t understand a word you say.&quot; She had left her 
translator in the ship. &quot;I&#39;m going to refuel and then leave.&quot;

&quot;Pi-chu? Chu chu pi-chu!&quot; Pichu squealed, shocked.

&quot;I honestly have no idea what that means.&quot; Samus told him again.

&quot;Catch!&quot; Samus whirled around and barely caught something a man threw to 
her. She observed it and saw, it was a mini translator. She thanked the 
man and put it on her shirt.

&quot;What did you say again?&quot;

&quot;You just got here. Why leave so soon?&quot; the little Pichu questioned.

&quot;It&#39;s my business.&quot; She told him firmly. She couldn&#39;t stop thinking 
about her, Zelda. She waved the thought off and marched towards a 
maintenance crew.

&quot;The tournament was postponed?&quot; Zelda was reading the same e-mail. She 
too had signed up to participate. Samus was probably going to be in the 
tournament as well.

&quot;What happened?&quot; Rei questioned. She was in PJs. She went to Zelda and 
sat down in the same chair. Zelda, a little nervous at Rei&#39;s actions, 
replied,

&quot;They postponed the tournament. Something&#39;s happened with the staff in 
charge.&quot;

&quot;They misspelled &#39;regrett&#39;, it should only have one &#39;t&#39;&quot;

&quot;I wonder what&#39;s going on.&quot;

&quot;And tournement is correctly spelled tournament.&quot;

Zelda glared at Rei, who looked back, and shrugged.

&quot;They also put an &#39;a&#39; instead of an &#39;s&#39; at the end of weeks. It says 
weeka.&quot;

&quot;Perfectionist.&quot; muttered Zelda.

&quot;What was that?&quot; Rei asked, a strange tone in her voice. She wrapped her 
arms around Zelda again and leaned off the chair, making them fall to 
the floor.

&quot;HEY! What are you... EEEEEK!&quot; Zelda shreiked.

&quot;You know I admire you Zelda. You&#39;re sweet.&quot;

&quot;I... I...&quot; Zelda was speechless. &quot;Do you MIND!?&quot; She yelled.

&quot;No. Not at all.&quot;

The rest is not to be said. Needless to say, Zelda&#39;s night was... 
different.

The next morning, the sun poked through the window, and shined in 
Zelda&#39;s eyes. She pulled the blanket over her head to block the light, 
and gazed at the sleeping Rei. Her arms were wrapped around Zelda, and 
her head snuggled up in her neck. She had, as well, a leg up over 
Zelda&#39;s hips. The night before, Zelda would have been freaked out, but 
things changed, suddenly. Zelda was content, lying there with Rei&#39;s arms 
around her. She had a certain attraction to Rei now. An attraction that 
she had with another before.

&quot;Rei?&quot; Zelda whispered. Rei moaned. Zelda smiled and said, &quot;I think it&#39;s 
morning.&quot;

Rei looked up from Zelda&#39;s neck, eyes half open. She yawned, mouth wide 
open, and forced her eyes open all the way.

&quot;Shall I make breakfast?&quot; Zelda asked.

&quot;Will it taste as good as dinner?&quot;

&quot;Better.&quot; they both giggled, and Rei kissed Zelda. 

Funny how this can happen overnight sometimes.

Rei stepped out of the shower to hear the sound of sizzling bacon. The 
smell was better, and she had to force herself to get dressed first.

She walked out a minute later, in her training outfit. She and Zelda sat 
down to the table, a delicious omelette in front of them, with bacon and 
sausage, a pitcher of milk and orange juice, and toast. A simple 
breakfast, but everything was made by Zelda, so it tasted good.

&quot;I&#39;m assisting a teacher in a sword class today, you can come along if 
you want, get some practice.&quot; Rei suggested, awfully forward.

&quot;Alright. I was going to go to the gym today anyway, so it won&#39;t matter 
if I do that instead. And remember we have work tonight.&quot;

&quot;Yeah yeah. Youre such a perfectionist kind of girl. You need to do 
everything just right, so you don&#39;t look bad.&quot;

Zelda gazed at Rei, who shrugged.

&quot;You should talk Rei. You corrected every spelling error on that e-mail 
last night. You convinced the man working on the billboard to add a 
little shade to a certain color, you had the rival restaurant re-make 
the food three times before I got to it. You go out of your way to try 
and make everything just right.&quot;

&quot;Eh-hem!?&quot;

&quot;Okay, so you don&#39;t TRY, but you get the idea.&quot;

&quot;So what if I like things perfect. I can&#39;t allow anything to be even 
slightly wrong for my Zelda.&quot;

Zelda looked at Rei again, sighed, and returned to eating.

They arrived in front of a building with a picture of two kids beating 
the heck out of each other with sticks. 

&quot;Well, it works doesn&#39;t it?&quot; Rei questioned.

&quot;I never said anything.&quot; Zelda replied, as they walked in.

They stepped through the door, and not a moment later did a kid come 
flying by their faces, and into a padded wall.

&quot;THAT&#39;S the correct attack Ling. Very good. Now you try it Billy.&quot; The 
instructor  was a loud, but energetic, trainer. He turned around and saw 
teh two girls and walked towards them, smiling widely and arms wide 
open. He grabbed them both in a big hug saying,

&quot;Ladies how good of you to join us. Rei I haven&#39;t seen you in a long 
time how have you been?&quot;

&quot;Good coach, just dandy.&quot; Rei answered back, acting as though trying to 
keep her distance from the instructor. Zelda leaned over and whispered 
into Rei&#39;s ear,

&quot;Is it just me, or does everyone here act a bit looney?&quot;

&quot;You act just as looney you know.&quot; Rei whispered back.

&quot;Well girls, are you ready to start?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know much about swordplay, Rei&#39;s sorta teaching me.&quot; Zelda 
explained.

&quot;Ahh, it&#39;s good you&#39;re here then. I taught Rei everything I know.&quot;

Rei leaned in to Zelda and whispered,

&quot;Which wasn&#39;t much. I learned mostly from myself.&quot;

Both girls giggled quietly.

&quot;Well then. Let&#39;s get you started.&quot;


Samus flew from the station as fast as she could. No matter how she 
tried, she couldn&#39;t get Zelda off her mind.

&quot;I can&#39;t stop worrying about her. I wonder how she&#39;s doing, if she&#39;s 
alright.&quot;

She logged onto the Galactic HQ website, looking for bounties.

There were three that she could take care of easily. She sent a message 
to HQ telling them that she would take the jobs. Then she shifted her 
ship into maximun speed and took off, searching for the location of the 
first target.

She stopped at a red planet with a few clouds here and there, and a 
large city on the surface. She flew her ship into the atmosphere.

Time to get into character. I haven&#39;t done this in a long time.

She dashed to her room and quickly equipped her suit, ten return to the 
front room.

As she neared the city, she could see mayhem below. Switching to the 
long range visual scanners she detected a large, single pilot machine 
causing the ruckus.

&quot;Alright, already into the action... oops.&quot; She covered her mouth and 
remembered not to say anything.

The machine was armed with a massive claw and a cannon. Samus stopped 
her ship in midair, jumped out of the hatch, and controlled it to fly 
higher. She landed on the machine&#39;s head, beam sword ignited, and 
cutting into the cockpit. The pilot inside realized what was going on 
and swerved the machine to throw Samus off. She flew off, but pushed off 
the side of a building and back at him. He in return, threw his massive 
fist at her. Samus fired her grappling beam at his feet and pulled out 
of the way. There she morphed to ball mode and bounced up the machine&#39;s 
leg, dropping bombs here and there. She rolled out of ball mode and 
jumped up to his head again. The bombs exploded together, crippling the 
machine. The pilot put the gun arm to his head where Samus was. He 
fired, Samus jumped. The shot blasted right through the cockpit, missing 
the pilot by a foot. Samus fell back down and landed into the cockpit. 
There she recieved a warm welcome of a knife thrusting at her. She moved 
sideways and caught the man&#39;s wrist, twisting it. He screamed and 
dropped the knife.

This is good. I&#39;m back!

She ripped the man out of his seat and conked him in the head with her 
gun, knocking him out. She then proceded to blast the inside controls of 
the machine, disallowing anyone else to pilot it. She called her ship 
back, and jumped up when it came.

She landed inside and grabbed some cables to tie the man with. After 
securely fastening the man, Samus turned around and looked at the 
machine.

What am I going to do about that? I don&#39;t have a grappling hook to 
attach to it.

She sat down at her computer and send a text message to a nearby cleanup 
crew. Then blasted off into space.

It&#39;s back to headquarters, and then the next victim. That was fun.

She stopped at HQ and dropped the man off, recieving her pay for the 
catch.

Next one. He&#39;s on Earth. Haven&#39;t been there for a while. She thought to 
herself as she blasted off full speed.

Some ways through the ride she started thinking about Zelda again. She 
wouldn&#39;t admit it, but she dreadfully missed Zelda&#39;s company. Even with 
the frequent breakdowns into crying, Zelda was still a joy to have 
around. Samus thought about how different she might be now. It had been 
at least 3 or 4 days since she left Zelda.

No. I can&#39;t think about her!

But the more she tried not to think about her, she thought more about 
her. She continued through space.


&quot;You are a born sword fighter Zelda!&quot; The instructor clapped Zelda on 
the back, almost causing her to drop her boken on her foot.

&quot;I&#39;m exhausted.&quot; Rei concurred.

&quot;Well thanks guys, but I don&#39;t feel too comfortable with the sword. Is 
there anything like a sword, but... not?&quot;

The kids all gaped at Zelda, who had just put on a fantastic show with 
Rei. The coach turned to the kids,

&quot;Remember my students, though I teach swords, and I will make you a 
master at it, you may not prefer a sword. You might prefer...&quot; He 
grabbed a spearlike  weapon from a rack. &quot;... a spear, or naginata. This 
is similar to a staff, but with a sword on the end. If you use some of 
my sword techniques, and combine them with skills you learn from staff 
or spear fighting classes, you can master the naginata on no time at 
all.&quot; He turned around and tossed the weapon to Zelda, who dropped her 
boken, and almost dropped the naginata. It felt... different in her 
hands. For one, it was much longer, and had a different wieght 
placement. For another, it had a smaller blade. She didn&#39;t know much 
staff fighting, bu she tried swinging the weapon. It felt smooth through 
the air.

&quot;I like it.&quot;

&quot;See my students? The sword is not quite her style. But she has mastered 
the sword here, and in time, she will go beyond master in the naginata.&quot;

Rei looked at Zelda, eyebrow raised. While the instructor kept 
yammering, Rei used her sword to cut the tops of his pants off. They 
slipped down, revealing pink underwear with flowers on them. The 
instructor realized this only when her heard Zelda snickering behind. 
The kids all stared at him, then burst out laughing. He grabbed his 
pants frantically and pulled them back up.

&quot;You see that? Rei has mastered stealth in her attacks. Not something I 
teach.&quot; He blushed as he moved to his office. &quot;Oh and... class 
dismissed.&quot;

The kids stood up, and did a respactable bow that they were taught here. 
Then ran out, cheering and laughing. Rei and Zelda stayed behind, gazing 
at each other. They giggled a moment before leaving.

At work Zelda was cooking furiously at three different dishes at once. 
Rei was serving. The manager walked in and observed Zelda&#39;s work.

&quot;3 days ago, you had set every pot you touched on fire. It was almost as 
if I had Samus Aran herself cooking in here.&quot; He said.

She dropped a salt shaker she was holding.

Samus!

She had forgotten Samus in the course of the last 3-4 days. She was 
angry at Samus for just leaving her, but she rememebered that Samus 
still cared for her. She couldn&#39;t stop thinking about her. One of the 
pots began boiling over, and another ignited in flame.

&quot;ZELDA!&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Zelda looked at the pots. Her eyes widened. &quot;OHH NOOOO!!&quot; She 
frantically went to work trying to save her masterpieces. She managed to 
stop the boiling pot from completely spilling over, but the other food 
was badly burned.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry about that.&quot; The manager said. Zelda smiled and shook her 
head, busily restoring the meals.

&quot;Tell me if I&#39;m intruding, but what&#39;s the deal with you and Samus?&quot;

&quot;Nothing.&quot; Zelda replied.

&quot;Okay. Good work anyway. Now to check if Rei dropped anything on 
someone&#39;s...&quot;

&quot;HEY YOU MORON!!! Watch where you&#39;re going!&quot; a big voice from the other 
room.

&quot;Too late.&quot; Zelda chuckled. The manager sighed, throwing his arms up and 
marching out of the kitchen.

That night, the two girls collapsed in their room. Zelda into a chair, 
and Rei on the floor.

&quot;Tonight has to be one of the worst nights I&#39;ve had working.&quot; Rei 
complained.

&quot;I made food explode.&quot; Zelda added.

&quot;You did WHAT!? You haven&#39;t done that in for a long time.&quot;

&quot;Only 3 days. Besides, I saved most of the food.&quot;

&quot;Yeah well, you can&#39;t exactly save food you dropped on a biker gang 
leader.&quot;

&quot;You dropped the food on...&quot;

Rei nodded. Zelda let her head fall back, eyes wide. She remembered the 
biker gang leader. He was there the first day she cooked. He had a mean 
temper and was almost as picky as Rei.

&quot;You like the naginata huh?&quot; Rei asked, steering away from the previous 
subject.

&quot;Yes, it feels comfortable.&quot;

&#39;I prefer the sword myself. I&#39;m better with that than any other weapon.&quot;

&quot;Clearly. I worked up quite a sweat just trying to keep you away.&quot;

&quot;You almost got me once.&quot;

&quot;Once.&quot;

&quot;Be quiet you.&quot;

They sat up and glared at each other, smiling. Then their glares turned 
into gazes. Zelda got up and walked over to Rei. She lay down next to 
Rei, their hands found each other&#39;s.

&quot;We need one of those holes that they have in the ceiling, you know, so 
you can gaze at the stars.&quot; Rei suggested.

&quot;Yeah. Maybe we should buy one. You know, we could sit on the roof.&quot;

They looked at each other, and then got up.

They climbed up onto the roof and sat down, their hands found each 
other&#39;s again.

The stars were beautiful that night.

&quot;How long do you want to stay out here?&quot; Zelda asked. Rei inched towards 
Zelda, and put her arm around her.

&quot;Forever.&quot; She whispered.


Samus flipped high ito the air to avoid another blast from the tank&#39;s 
cannons.

How am I going to get past this thing&#39;s attacks? I can&#39;t get close, or 
it&#39;ll use it&#39;s shotguns. If I hide, it just waits and fires mortars 
everywhere. I lost count of the shots it was using at 556. I don&#39;t know 
how much ammo it has left.

She was crouching behind a sand dune, furiously thinking of something 
she could do. She was convinced it wasn&#39;t using it&#39;s full power.

Okay then. I haven&#39;t used these in a long time.

She switched her weapon to her biggest missles. Leaping up into the air 
again, she took aim and fired. The tank fired at her as well. She 
dropped in time to evade the shots, and her missle hit square onto the 
armor of the tank. She looked up to see, but there was only a black 
colored splot on it&#39;s armor from the explosion. The tank began rolling 
towards her. She fired again, this time into one of the guns. The missle 
flew straight down the barrel and inside. She saw an explosion, and the 
machine stopped. She smiled to herself, and dashed towards the machine, 
activating her beamsword.

She reached it and found the door, but before she could cut away at it, 
the tank began shifting and rumbling, almost knocking Samus off. She 
held tight and thrust her sword into the armor, cutting away at it. Then 
suddenly, the machine stood up.

Wait a second, this is a tank. Why is it standing?

No sooner than that did she realize an arm with a nasty blade on it 
reach for her. She jumped off, switching her weapon to her combined 
shot. She fired a tripled blast of ice energy. It hit the armor, 
freezing a section. The machine turned around. It was like a centaur bug 
machine. It&#39;s treads had converted to four legs, and it&#39;s front section 
had converted to the arms, which now pointed at her.

Oh no.

It fired the shotguns at her, at a fast speed. The pellets from the 
shots hit her armor, not throwing her back too far, but causing decent 
damage. As soon as she landed it came barreling down on her, blades out 
and ready to take a big swipe. Samus readied herself, and locked on to 
the machine. She fired a shot, and it hit dead center in it&#39;s face. She 
jumped over the first massive blade, and landed on it&#39;s second arm. She 
ran up to it&#39;s head, and jumped off the arm as soon as it began moving. 
She ignited her sword again. It slashed at her, and she grabbed it&#39;s 
head with her grappling beam, pulling herself away from the blade. She 
thrust her sword deep into the thing&#39;s &#39;skull&#39;, and ripped the sword 
out. The machine moved abruptly while she was still pulling out. She 
fell to the ground, landing on her feet. It was too late to avoid a 
swift kick from the front legs. She flew back, arming her heavy missles 
again. She landed on the ground and fired, but her shot was blocked by 
the machine&#39;s leg as it came down on her.


&quot;SAMUS!!!&quot; Zelda jumped up in her bed. She was sweating cold, and 
panting hard. Rei woke up from Zelda&#39;s scream.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong Zelda?&quot; Rei asked, worried to death.

&quot;Noth... nothing.&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t sound like nothing. What&#39;s going on?&quot;

Zelda, still breathing heavily, looked at Rei. She shook her head.

&quot;What happened with you and Samus?&quot;

&quot;I...I... nothing.&quot;

&quot;I want to help you, and I can&#39;t if you don&#39;t tell me.&quot;

Zelda looked away, a tear almost coming out. She had dreamt of Samus 
fighting a massive monster, and she was losing. She clenched her fist in 
her chest, wincing at a huge pain.

&quot;Zelda? Are you sure you&#39;re alright? Do I need to take you to the 
hospital?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not going to cry. I&#39;m not going to cry.&quot;

&quot;Zelda, tell me what&#39;s wrong.&quot; Rei tugged at Zelda&#39;s arm, almost tearing 
herself. Zelda lay back into bed, and gazed at Rei.

&quot;Samus and I... well...&quot;

&quot;You and Samus? Wow, I never knew.&quot;

&quot;We, didn&#39;t go THAT far you know. It&#39;s okay.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but... what happened with you two. I mean, why aren&#39;t you still 
with her?&quot;

Zelda looked up at the ceiling and sighed. The pain wouldn&#39;t go away.

&quot;She... she left me on Ceres II. I dont know what happened with her, but 
she said she couldn&#39;t be with me any more. She didn&#39;t want to see me 
getting hurt, so she just left me.&quot;

Rei gazed at Zelda, a tear streamed down her face. She looked away.

&quot;She said she still cared about me. I can&#39;t stop thinking about her, 
even though I am so angry at her.&quot; Zelda heard Rei crying.

&quot;Now what&#39;s wrong with you?&quot; She asked.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m so sorry I did that with you.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;You and Samus, you two were in love. You loved her a lot. I can sense 
it. She loves you too, and probably still does, but won&#39;t admit it.&quot;

&quot;Rei...&quot;

Rei put her head in her hands, resting on her knees, crying.

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry Zelda. I didn&#39;t know about you two. I went too fast didn&#39;t 
I?&quot;

&quot;I... I don&#39;t know what to say.&quot; Zelda replied.

&quot;Zelda, I love you, but your heart belongs with Samus.&quot;

Zelda sat up, and stared at the floor. Rei stood up, and walked out of 
the room. She almost left, when Zelda said,

&quot;Rei wait. I don&#39;t love Samus anymore. How could you love someone who 
just leaves you, and tries to forget you. I just can&#39;t forget about her, 
but I hate her. I don&#39;t love her anymore.&quot;

Rei looked back at Samus, tears in her eyes.

&quot;I love you too Rei. You don&#39;t have a life like Samus has. I know you 
won&#39;t leave me so you can&#39;t see me get hurt. You don&#39;t worry about me so 
much that it gets in your way. I can&#39;t love someone as selfish as 
Samus.&quot;

She stood up and walked to Rei, wrapping her arms around her.

&quot;You care about me. You were worried about my love for someone, and 
didn&#39;t want to hurt me. I love you now Rei.&quot;

Rei smiled slowly, eyes glistening. She wrapped her arms around Zelda.


None of this helped Samus however, as the machine still drove his foot 
into Samus&#39;s chest.

&quot;You... bas... ah... bastard!&quot; She had grabbed it&#39;s foot and was trying 
to push it off. She was trying to figure another way to get out as well. 
Oh how she wished even PICHU would come and save her. Unfortunately, no 
ship ever came into sight.

&quot;Zelda, I wish you were here, but I don&#39;t think a thousand wishes could 
bring you back to me.&quot;

An idea popped into Samus&#39;s head. She began pushing to one side with 
most of her strength. The leg shifted to keep her under.

Perfect.

She immediately pushed the leg the opposite direction with all her 
might. It slid past her and slammed into the ground. Samus quickly 
morphed and created a bomb, then shoved it into the nearest joint she 
could find, and rolled away. The bomb exploded, damaging the joint. She 
jumped up again with all her strength, driving the sword upwards into 
the armor. The machine, stunned, fell in half, front side coming apart 
first. It collapsed to the ground, thundering as it fell. Samus flipped 
through the air and landed on the top hatch of the machine, driving her 
sword into it. She popped off the door and hopped inside.

Oh great, it&#39;s a mini complex. She though as she looked around. There 
was no sign of any people. She slowly stepped through the thin hallways, 
peeking around the corners.

Suddenly, a clash noise behind her. She whirled around to see a man in a 
skeleton mecha suit. She could see his face, he was smiling cruely. He 
launched his fist at her, leaving no escape. She was hit and sent flying 
through the tank&#39;s insides. She landed in the control room. There was a 
dead guard lying on the floor, head split open, and blood everywhere. 
The man ripped the hallway to pieces coming after Samus. He plowed 
through the wall and lunged at Samus. She rolled under him, in ball 
form, dropping a cluster of bombs. The man turned his suit around, and 
was blown out through the window by the explosions. He hit the ground 
hard, and didn&#39;t move for a few seconds. Samus charged up her plasma 
beam and lunged out the window after him. He used a force thruster on 
his back to jump to his feet. Samus landed on his front side and fired 
her shot into the mech&#39;s generator. It went critical, and Samus had to 
rip the man out of his seat before the machine exploded. She called her 
ship, knocking him unconscious, and jumped inside.

&quot;One more to go. I&#39;m getting used to this again.&quot;

She flew back to HQ quickly, and dropped off the criminal, recieving her 
pay.

&quot;I hear this group is a dangerous one Samus. So be extra careful.&quot;

&quot;Group?&quot; Samus asked.

&quot;Yeah, big badass group, even more viscious than the pirates.&quot;

Samus took off, wondering about that. 

She had only flown for half an hour before she picked up distress calls 
from a nearby station. Derekin station, an older station, not widely 
known, but one of the oldest remaining, was calling for anyone to help. 
She flew at top speed towards the station. This wasn&#39;t her primary 
target. That would have to wait until she did this. She quickly landed 
in the badly beaten up hangar, and jumped out. 

She landed, crouching, on the walking platform. Glancing towards the 
main door, she observed instense combat. This station was appearantly 
heavily guarded, but the opposition managed to punch through. The 
distress signal suddenly stopped, and the lights all went out. She 
activated her ship&#39;s attachment, and had it latched on to the platform. 
She then went through the door, heat visor activated. 

About 5 minutes of careful walking, after she made it perfectly clear 
she was here, on accident, she came to the control room. There were dead 
bodies lying about. It looked like a horde of mini-Ridleys came through 
here. She hoped to gods that wasn&#39;t this case. She whipped her head 
around to her left as she heard an object clunking around. She looked 
around to see a ventilation shaft, opened up.

Ah ha! She thought. She silently strode towards the shaft, weapon out. 
She hadn&#39;t charged it because she had not wanted to make any noise. 
Looking up into the shaft she saw nothing, and no traces of anything. 
She jumped up into the shaft and looked around. She didn&#39;t hear or 
notice the 5 bulky figures sneaking out the door. Samus rolled through 
the shaft. It was a large shaft, but she was more or less invisible like 
this. She rolled through quickly, but finally realized, nothing actually 
had entered the shaft. She cursed to herself, and unrolled. 

She found a shaft entrance and slipped up to it. She peeked down through 
the vent door, looking around. She saw movement for a split second, but 
nothing when she looked. She held extremely still, knowing that 
something was there. She saw nothing move, so she backed off. Still, 
nothing passed by the shaft entrance. She carefully pried the piece off 
and set it in the shaft, then slipped out, looking around frantically. 

She moved towards the hangar. She considered that the enemy might be 
trying to escape, and broke into a run. She thought she saw movement in 
the corridors as she passed them, in fact, she KNEW there was movement. 
She fired shot down the corridors, finally seeing the multiple bulky 
objects, moving at high speeds. She looked ahead at the door to the 
hangar and ran through, jerking to the left. She ran and fired at the 
objects. Three of them ran towards a ship that Samus hadn&#39;t noticed 
before. They were carrying a large machine with them. The other two ran 
at Samus, at almost blinding speeds. She fired at them, but they moved 
sideways, and started circling her. She felt like she knew this attack. 
None of her shots were hitting.

Suddenly she was struck from behind, a heavy hit from the one she lost 
track of. The one in front of her slammed her in the arm, and into the 
torso, with the broadside of his forearm. She flew to the side, almost 
into a broken ship. She whirled around and saw the first one&#39;s fist 
coming at her, just in time for her to duck, and ram her sword into it&#39;s 
chest. There it grabbed her and flung her over the back of it&#39;s head, 
and into a wall. The second one grabbed her head and began crushing the 
helmet. She kicked it in the ribs, but it had little effect. Her helmet 
began cracking. She jumped up and pushed off the wall, into the 
creature, pushing him back. She broke free of his grip, and fired 
several shots into it&#39;s face. It didn&#39;t stop the creature as it rammed 
it&#39;s shoulder into her, knocking her back. She stumbled as she regained 
her balance. One of the creatures turned around and ran towards the 
ship. The one that faced her now, remained. It lunged at her, body 
lowered. She flipped over it and fired more shot&#39;s into it&#39;s head, and 
started charging another shot. She landed, and was struck from behind, 
knocked to the ground. Before she could roll back up, she was pounded on 
her spine. She heard a crack from it as the creature hit her a second 
time. After it hit the third time, she quickly jerked and rolled away, 
jumping to her feet. The creature, who had slammed his massive fists 
into the ground again, pushed up and grabbed Samus from behind. It ran 
her towards a wall. She squirmed around and ran up the wall, breaking 
from it&#39;s grip. She landed behind it, ducked as it whirled around with 
another massive arm swing, and punched it in the chest, firing a fully 
charged blast. It was blown against the wall. The creatures&#39; ship began 
flying away, and the one she was fighting glanced at it. She looked at 
it for a moment. It was still alive after the shot.

HEY! I recognize this thing. No...

She saw what it was, but didn&#39;t see it&#39;s head bash into her helmet, 
knocking her back. The creature ran to the ship and lunged to it, 
grabbing onto the door and pulling itself in. The ship then blasted off. 
Samus quickly got up and ran to her ship. As soon as she jumped in she 
was at the controls, locking the hatch, and speeding away after the 
enemy ship. Behind her, the run down station began to explode.

&quot;I&#39;m positive I&#39;m cursed.&quot; She muttered as she flew away.

She controlled her ship firmly, chasing after the other ship.

Those things. I haven&#39;t seen them in years.

About four years ago, the Mother Brain began using humans in suits that 
were supposed to be fear inducing. She had a lot more minions after 
that, but they weren&#39;t as tough as before. It seemed as though the 
original pirates disappeared. Now they were back. These real pirates 
WERE fear. They might as well be dressed up in pink bunny suits, and 
still scare the crud out of their enemy. They were fast, had brutal 
strength, incredible durability, and were smarter than humans. To top it 
off, they were viscious beyond reason and knew how to fight, well. The 
last time she fought the real pirates was years back, on a planet she 
couldn&#39;t remember the name of. It was the second time she had 
&#39;completely wiped out&#39; the last of the metroids. The &#39;Prime Metroid&#39; as 
it was called. Or maybe it was the &#39;Metroid Prime&#39;, she couldn&#39;t 
remember precisely.

Still, she chased after the pirates, full speed.


&quot;I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t have any real fighting experience, so I don&#39;t 
know how I would do this.&quot;

&quot;Oh come on. Just one mission.&quot; Zelda pleaded to Rei. They were at a 
galactic bounty hunter&#39;s HQ, looking for something to do for the next 
few days. They were off work for a while. 

&quot;Okay here you go. Something easy to start off with.&quot; Zelda pointed out 
a small fry on the board.

&quot;Nah. I want a challenge. I&#39;ve faced down guys like that all the time. 
The only reason I would lose to them, is because I fell asleep. It makes 
me wonder why guys like them are up on this board.&quot;

&quot;I thought you said you didn&#39;t have any real experience.&quot;

&quot;Uh... Did I? Nah, of course not.&quot;

Zelda sighed and shook her head.

&quot;Don&#39;t even bother with that one anyway.&quot; A man came up abruptly and 
took down the notice. &quot;You would believe who caught him. An unarmed, 
teenage, redhead girl with a bunch of modernized 007 equipment, aided by 
a nutcase who carried around a naked molerat with him. Talk about your 
group of oddballs.&quot; He walked away.

&quot;Oh hey. How about this. It says &#39;Great Melee Tournament particepants 
preferred&#39;. Don&#39;t you fall under that category?&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;Yeah. I wonder why. What do you say Rei?&quot;

&quot;Sure why the heck not. It&#39;s not like it&#39;ll take that long. Probably 
just lawyers gone wrong, with guns.&quot;

Zelda laughed at the thought, then went to the front desk to take the 
assignment.

They climbed into Zelda&#39;s ship. It was a tight fit, but just enough room 
for them.

&quot;Are you ready?&quot; Zelda asked.

&quot;Um, if I start cramping, I&#39;ll let you know, as well as the people in 
the next solar system.&quot;

Zelda and Rei both laughed again. Zelda put the ship into launch mode, 
and they lifted off the ground. Soon they were flying out of the 
atmosphere. Rei sat up and looked out the window, gazing at the stars.

&quot;Oh. It&#39;s beautiful out here. We can see the stars so much more 
clearly.&quot; Rei whispered.

&quot;I know. When I first got this ship, I decided to turn off the engine, 
and just drift, watching the stars in complete silence. It&#39;s so 
relaxing, being all alone in the middle of nowhere in this huge 
universe.&quot; Zelda gazed dreamily at the stars as well.

&quot;You know something we might need, that we forgot to get before we 
left?&quot;

&quot;Hm?&quot;

&quot;Weapons, equipment, armor, food. The works. Maybe a bigger ship?&quot;

Zelda chuckled, and searched for a nearby station.

&quot;Let&#39;s see. I&#39;m picking up, Hydra sta... tion.&quot; Zelda went silent.

&quot;Is something... oh... never mind.&quot;

&quot;No no it&#39;s nothing. Don&#39;t mind me. That&#39;s where we&#39;re going.&quot; Zelda 
said, shaking the thoughts off her head.

&quot;Hydra station this is Zelda, requesting permission to dock.&quot; Zelda 
spoke into the intercom.

&quot;Zelda, this is Hydra station, give us a moment, and we&#39;ll secure a 
docking bay for you.&quot;

They waited a moment, before...

&quot;Zelda, you are clear to dock in bay 35. Just fly under the station and 
to the blinking light.&quot;

Zelda confirmed and flew below the station. She found the flashing light 
and entered the opening door. She flew up and inside, allowing the 
magnetic field to draw her in, and the arms to grab her ship while the 
lock-in proceded. With a jolt, she was locked in.

&quot;Zelda, give us a moment to fill the bay with oxygen, then we can let 
you out.&quot;

A platform slid under the ship, for them to walk on. Then a hissing 
sound was heard, and the ship rumbled as air filled the chamber. Finally 
it stopped.

&quot;Zelda, you are clear to disembark. Welcome back to Hydra station, 
haven&#39;t heard your voice in a long while.&quot; The transmission ended. Zelda 
sat there, shocked somewhat that the person remembered her.

&quot;Okay, that&#39;s one naginata, and one upgraded sword. That comes out to 
650 credits.&quot; The cashier told them. Zelda paid and recieved the 
weapons. She walked out, looking for Rei, who was buying food, and other 
small supplies. Soon, Rei came along, carrying two small bags.

&quot;Hiya. Got the stuff?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Here&#39;s your sword. You remembered a medical kit?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Now to get to armor.&quot;

The two turned around to go to the armory, but ran into the commander.

&quot;Zelda? Is that you? Wow, I almost didn&#39;t recognize you. I heard you had 
returned, and here you are.&quot; He greeted her.

&quot;Hi again. Sorry, but we don&#39;t have really any time to chat. We took up 
a mission, a bounty, and we just stopped by because we forgot supllies.&quot; 
Zelda told him, trying to get away.

&quot;Oh hey. I&#39;ve got your old armor, the one you used when you defended the 
station. I had some people clean it up and upgrade it a bit. It&#39;s like 
brand new if you want it. I was going to give it to you, but you and 
Samus disappeared.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well, we had a mission that time as well.&quot;

&quot;Say, where is Samus?&quot;

&quot;She doing her own thing. I really have to get moving.&quot;

&quot;Okay then, sorry. Follow me to my office and I&#39;ll get you the armor. 
Maybe I can grab something for your friend too.&quot;

The two nodded and followed the commander around the station. Finally to 
his office.

He went to one of the walls and pushed a button, opening a door. He went 
inside, and came out a moment later, carrying Zelda&#39;s old armor. He went 
back in after handing it to Zelda. They could hear clanking and 
clinkering.

&quot;You know the commander of the station? Better yet, you helped defend 
this station?&quot;

&quot;Yes I did. I dreaded every moment of it. Those pirates were nasty 
buggers.&quot;

&quot;Pirates? You&#39;re lucky to have survived back then.&quot;

&quot;Are you saying I suck?&quot;

The commander finally stumbled out, knocking a few items out as well.

&quot;Sorry kid. I don&#39;t have anything. It&#39;s all busted up stuff.&quot; He said.

&quot;Hey, what&#39;s that?&quot; Rei asked, pointing to a wooden crate with strange 
writing on it.

&quot;Oh that? I dunno. Let&#39;s find out.&quot; He grabbed the crate and dragged it 
out. Rei grabbed the top and studied the writing. Shaking her head, she 
finally yanked the top off. Inside was a bunch of wood chips, which Rei 
plunged her hands into. She drew out a gardening set. The other two 
stared, shocked.

&quot;I forgot, I put that in their when my wife died. After I left my home 
planet.&quot; The commander told them quietly. Rei dug deeper.

&quot;I feel something in here.&quot;

&quot;There probably IS something in there.&quot; Zelda replied to Rei.

&quot;No, I feel something, in my spirit.&quot; Rei pulled out a ring that had 
robot style winglets.

&quot;Oh, wait. I think...&quot; The commander began. Rei pulled out a chestpiece 
of some odd looking armor. Then she pulled out waist, leg, and arm 
pieces. They were all smoothe, and felt like plastic.

&quot;Ahh yes. I remember this. It was an armor suit we found in a temple. It 
was on a skeleton. We took it to a research station and investigated it. 
We tested it, but nothing ever happened. The armor seemed worthless. I 
don&#39;t know why it ended up here, I thought we dumped it.&quot; The commander 
explained to them, picking up the headset. Rei looked it all over.

&quot;I feel power coming from it.&quot; She said.

&quot;I do too.&quot; Zelda seconded.

&quot;I don&#39;t feel anything.&quot; The commander said. He handed the headset back 
to Rei, and it lit up in her hands. A light on either side of it, on the 
winglets, pulsed.

&quot;Wow. This is mezmerizing.&quot; She exclaimed.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t bother. It doesn&#39;t look like it would fit you now that I 
think about it.&quot; The commander observed. Rei ignored him and put the 
headset on. For some reason, Zelda thought she could see a faint glow in 
her eyes. Rei slipped on the rest of the armor pieces. The commander was 
right, it was too big, but once she slipped on the last piece, it made a 
fizzling sound and tightened over Rei&#39;s body. It was a perfect fit.

&quot;That&#39;s funny. It never worked when we had our soldiers try it.&quot;

&quot;Well it works now.&quot; Rei replied. &quot;I feel really powerful in this.&quot;

&quot;Feel free to take it. I have no use for it.&quot;

&quot;Thank you sir.&quot; Rei bowed to the commander. Then the two girls left.

&quot;This here ship will seat two people, just like you. It is a high 
performance ship, with mounted lazer weapons, missles, a light tractor 
beam, and shielding capability. It is also equipped with a stealth 
system, silencer, cloaking device, and high quality detector. It is the 
perfect small ship for the likes of you two.&quot; The ship salesman showed 
the girls a ship. They looked it over, Rei&#39;s eyes searching everywhere 
for flaws. She observed the engine, looking through precisely. She 
observed the amored plates, and all the weapons. The salesman stood 
there, wringing his hands, smiling away, hoping they would buy.

&quot;Can I trade my old ship, along with some credits, to pay for this?&quot; 
Zelda asked, while Rei still scanned over the ship.

&quot;Of course. Just how old is your model?&quot;

&quot;Not very. I bought it recently.&quot;

&quot;Okay then. I guess you bought from one of our rival businesses, if you 
wanted to get rid of it that fast.&quot;

&quot;Actually, it is a really good ship. I just need a two seater with good 
capabilities.&quot;

&quot;Actually Zelda, yours is better than this thing, by far for sure.&quot; Rei 
shouted from inside the engine compartment. The salesman yelped, teeth 
clenched.

&quot;This is our best model. I don&#39;t know how any other ship could out do 
this one. I mean aside from a larger ship.&quot;

&quot;Let me show you the ship, then we&#39;ll decide.&quot; Zelda lead him to her 
bay.

&quot;Is this a good deal ship?&quot; Zelda calmly asked. the salesman was gaping 
at the ship, jaw to the floor, and eyes wide open. He strode over to it 
and observed it.

&quot;Oh I could kiss you for this. This model does surpass ours. I would 
give you that two seater, with upgrades, free for this thing. We&#39;ve been 
trying to get our hands on samples of technology this good.&quot;

&quot;Oh thank you sir. You may have it then. Here are the keys, and the 
papers.&quot; Zelda said as she grabbed multpiple items from inside the ship. 
The two walked back to Rei, who was still observing the two seater.

&quot;Well Rei. We got ourselves a ship, so let&#39;s get on our way.&quot; Zelda 
shouted.

&quot;Actually ladies... I&#39;m not really supposed to show you this, but... I 
can show you a new prototype model we&#39;re building. Maybe with a little 
extra cash...&quot;

The two girls looked at each other, smiling gleefully.

They shot away from the space station, 75% speed, which was still pretty 
damn fast. The new prototype was incredible. With faster speeds than any 
ship they had on the market, full combat arsenal, silencer, full 
grappling beam, cloaking device, and radar jammer, and  a special 
unknown capability, this was a winner for their money.

&quot;This also has a high-tech searching computer, memory banks, and control 
system. Let&#39;s see. Where did the paper say these baddies were?&quot; Rei 
blabbed on, excited. Zelda had to admit, the suit Rei was wearing looked 
good on her.

&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too far from here.&quot; Zelda replied finally. They 
began a search with the name on the mission paper, locating... nothing.

&quot;Okay. I&#39;m already lost.&quot; Rei threw up her hands.

&quot;This business is difficult. We need to study the happenings, and then 
search from there. Find as much as we can to lead us to the source.&quot;

&quot;Okay, let&#39;s check the reports.&quot; Rei finished.

They learned about the attacks on multiple space stations, mostly 
research labs. All the stations that were attacked carried some new 
prototype device. What was stolen could not be identified, as the 
attackers hit hard before they stole, and blew up the stations when they 
were done. They found that most of the new technology was power 
generators and such. Mining equipment was also a possibility. A 
particular piece was an energy enhancer, and manipulator. The girls 
looked at each other, grinning.

&quot;I&#39;ll bet you they&#39;ll attack another research station soon.&quot; Rei 
suggested. The computer beeped, notifying them of an update on the 
mission. Derekin station had been under attack.

&quot;I doubt they will now.&quot; Zelda said. &quot;Let&#39;s see what you had on you 
Derekin.&quot;

She searched the database for equipment Derekin station carried.

It was a metal extractor, used for taking out only certain kinds of 
metal in any material or substance.

&quot;I think they are setting up a mining operation.&quot; Rei suggested.

&quot;Yeah, probably. Where&#39;s the richest mining section Rei?&quot;

Rei worked at her computer. 

&quot;There&#39;s an asteroid belt, supposedly filled with phason. That&#39;s nearby. 
It&#39;s suicide to do work on an asteroid in the asteroid field though, so 
I doubt they landed there.&quot;

&quot;What else we got? We need material here.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s a planet covered in thick forest nearby. Some plants down there 
have an armor fortifying sap. No mining stations there though.&quot;

Zelda sat, arms crossed. They were obviously making something, big. A 
machine of some sort. What where they going to attack though? What were 
they doing?

&quot;I&#39;ve found a mining station, perfect for mining bandits. It&#39;s on a 
planet not farther than a jump from here. They&#39;ve got tunnels rich with 
minerals.&quot; Rei told Zelda, covinced it was the place.

&quot;How well guarded are you mining station?&quot; Zelda searched the station&#39;s 
operation systems. It was entirely automated. Not a single breathing, 
living thing was working in the tunnels.

&quot;Okay, let&#39;s hit it!&quot; Rei shouted. Zelda and Rei grasped each others 
hands, and hit the jump button together. They stretched forward and 
entered the jump.


Samus veered her ship left to avoid yet another flying asteroid. She was 
cursing at herself for being so stupid as to enter an asteroid field 
behind PIRATES. They seemed to be able to avoid being hit every single 
time a rock came their way, but Samus had to work hard to keep from 
being hit. She had already been scraped once, and almost a second time. 
She had been grateful for her natural reactions, otherwise she would be 
drifting through space, with a ship that had a massive hole down the 
center. To make matters worse, the pirates&#39; ship was well armed. Samus 
cursed at her poorly equipped ship. It was time to get a new one... or 
rather, after she took care of these pirates. They had the advantage in 
that she couldn&#39;t destroy them yet. They had to lead her to their 
hideout. She was hard pressed to find a way to convince them that she 
was no longer following them, and not lose them at the same time.

They fired two more reversed missles. Samus was preparing to avoid them 
when she noticed a rock flying her way. If she could time this just 
right...

She flew towards the rock, missles streaming towards her. Her ship flew 
behind the rock, and she turned around, to face the missles. She locked 
on and fired at the last second. The missles exploded, and Samus 
immediately switched off her scanners. She ejected the ships spare 
parts, making it look as though she had exploded into pieces.

She glanced around to see another large rock flying her way. She smiled 
and slipped behind it as it passed. She kept hidded behind it, but saw 
the pirates ship fly behind the rock and observe the faked death.

Samus considered a different technique they could use to detect her. She 
flew to an asteroid she was passing, and slipped into a hole inside. 
There she grabbed the rock wall with her attachment, and shut her power 
completely off. Fortunately for her, the asteroid was near the right 
color to camaflouge with. Just her luck.

She waited for a while, trying to find the pirates. She knew they 
weren&#39;t convinced just yet. The asteroid slowly rotated around, and 
showed Samus a clear view of the pirates ship, still waiting. Now we 
would see if her camaflouge worked.

The pirates circled around, and Samus tensed. She reminded herself to 
relax, her finger hovered above the power switch. The pirates moved 
towards her ship, slowly. They didn&#39;t see her yet. Samus noticed her 
heartbeat increasing, and her breath getting heavier. She switched off 
her suit, and made sure there wasn&#39;t anything else that had been turned 
on. The pirates ship moved closer.

Oh god they&#39;ve seen me. I know it.

The pirates remained there, and fired a few blasts around. Samus didn&#39;t 
budge, but her heartbeat was heavy. Fortunately, even the creatures with 
the best hearing couldn&#39;t hear activity in space. Still, Samus tried 
hard to calm herself down.

Finally, the ship turned around and blasted off. Samus waited.

When the ship had left her view she slowly turned her power on. She 
detached from the asteroid, and flew slowly after the pirates.

&quot;Gods I hate you pirates. You scare me half to death.&quot; She growled.

The pirates left the asteroid belt, but Samus stayed inside, to mess up 
their scanners. She was left with visual detection though. Finally, when 
it was safe, she left the asteroid belt. Far ahead she could see a 
planet. She ran a check on the planet, and identified it as Terra II. 
The galaxy&#39;s #1 mining planet.

Samus still had no clue what the machine was that the pirates stole, but 
she was going to find out.

She entered the atmosphere, slowly, so as not to reveal her postion by 
her entrance fire. She observed the land below her. Swampy, forest, 
mountain ranges. Just excellent.

She landed on a landing pad in the midst of the forest area, and saw 
that there had already been some fighting. Mostly just ships though. 
There were lots of smaller pirate fighters that had been littered here 
and there.

&quot;Wait a minute. These look like human pirate ships.&quot; She said quietly as 
she jumped out of her ship. She landed with a thud, not expecting 
slightly heavier gravity. She could fix that though. She entered a few 
codes into her gun arm, which transferred actions to her helmet, 
activating the gravity suit&#39;s ability to adjust to different pressures 
and gravities. She looked up, and saw dozens of human pirates strewn 
about. They had been mostly hacked to pieces. Whoever got here first was 
using a blade of some sort. Maybe two weapons at that. Come to think of 
it, Samus couldn&#39;t remember the last time she actually had someone get 
to the scene before her.

I&#39;m getting old. She thought as she stepped over the pirates&#39; bodies.

&quot;I lost track of the alien pirates&#39; ship. It doesn&#39;t seem to be here.&quot;

She walked towards what looked like the entrance. There had been 
explosions, numerous ones, that had bombarded the door. She stepped 
inside, readying her gun. She might have to fight whoever it was who was 
trying to claim this bounty before her.


Zelda lunged back, whipping around and slicing the head off of a pirate 
foolish enough to get in her way. The pirate she jumped from lunged at 
her, which she responded to by blasting him with a fireball, sending him 
flying into a wall, and exploding. Rei had parried five pirates&#39; attacks 
at once, and ran one through. The others swung blindly at her. Rei 
stepped back and swung her sword, flinging the dead pirate into two of 
the others. The remaining ones cursed, and one lunged at her, the other 
scrambed to aim and fire his gun. Rei blocked the pirates slash, whipped 
his sword around, and ran him through, carrying him all the way into the 
second. She pulled her sword out and let them fall.

Rei perked up for some reason, looking slighty upward.

&quot;Another person just entered the tunnels. This one used our entrance. I 
can&#39;t identify him.&quot; Rei whispered to Zelda, inching towards her.

&quot;What about the five that came in just before?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re still moving. They seem to know of a different... they just got 
lower than us. I think they took a shortcut.&quot;

Zelda sighed of frustration.

&quot;Come on. Let&#39;s keep moving, lest the guy following catches up.&quot; Zelda 
suggested. Rei nodded and the two dashed down the tunnels. They were in 
a complex of massive, long, winding tunnels that were just peppered with 
jewels and metals.

Rei and Zelda ran through the tunnels, Rei slightly faster than Zelda, 
and could be going faster. Her suit somehow made her feel lighter, and 
stronger. She was not affected by the stronger gravity, unlike Zelda, 
who almost fell to her knees when she stood up.

They slashed through two pirates standing guard at a gate, and kept 
running. They were getting bored of all the pirates they were fighting.

Suddenly they came to a split in the tunnels.

&quot;Which way Rei? Can you sense them?&quot; Zelda asked. She was referring to 
voices crying for help once their attack started. She assumed they were 
prisoners. Zelda was pretty sure they were the staff of the tournaments, 
so their rescue was crucial.

&quot;Right.&quot; Rei answered. The two dashed to the right.

They came to a screeching halt when they saw the surprise drop. They 
looked down, and saw how far the drop was.

&quot;This is huge. How do we get down?&quot; Rei questioned. Zelda grabbed held 
on to Rei.

&quot;I love you too Zelda.&quot;

&quot;Watch this, hold on.&quot;

Zelda used her spell and teleported down to the bottom with a breeze of 
wind.

&quot;Wow. That was amazing.&quot; Rei commented.

&quot;I haven&#39;t been using it much lately.&quot; Zelda replied.


Samus ran through the tunnels, observing the dead bodies that lay strewn 
about everywhere she stepped. Who on earth was doing this. It was 
definately recent, most of these guys were still breathing, if only 
barely. The warrior ahead was running through, wiping out these numbers 
and keeping a strong pace ahead of Samus.

&quot;I have to admit soldier, you may actually beat me.&quot;

Samus suddenly detected a strong wind from... deeper inside the mining 
caverns? She felt this wind before, but she couldn&#39;t remember where 
from.

After minutes of running, she came to a split. She couldn&#39;t figure out 
where the other warrior went in, so she chose one. She ran down the 
left. She heard footsteps ahead, and stopped running. She inched up 
behind a corner, and peeked around. There were the 5 real pirates, 
marching along, carrying the machine with them. She studied them, and 
tried to identify the machine. However, it was too far away, and they 
were moving too fast.

When the pirates where clear, Samus dashed after them. She would get to 
the bottom of this operation, and they would lead her there. Then she 
would destroy them all.

First she had to stop running so as not to crash into this dead end.

Dead end? I swear... they ran this way.

Samus looked around, for any sign of the pirates. She tried to find a 
way past the wall. She knew this wasn&#39;t really a dead end, she just had 
to prove it. She gave up looking and began charging plasma shot. She 
took aim.

Down the wall came, with gears flying here and there. She ran through.


&quot;I found them!&quot; Rei shouted back to Zelda as they ran into a large 
cavern. There was a large cage with multiple humans inside yelling for 
them to help. Rei and Zelda ran to the cage, and positioned their 
weapons to break the locks.

At the other end of the cavern, a secret door slid open, and three huge 
monsters came dashing through, one carrying an odd machine. They stopped 
running and looked at Zelda and Rei. The one holding the machine turned 
and sprinted out a large door, and shut it. A rock barrier came down to 
hide it, and further ensure passage to be impsossible. The other two 
came charging at Zelda and Rei. They acitvated a reverse pointed energy 
blade from their elbows. They shifted a device on their wrists, and kept 
running.

&quot;Those are the REAL space pirates! Watch out!&quot; cried  man from inside 
the cage. Zelda and Rei turned their attention to the new, real, huge, 
pirates. One of them lunged into the air, faster, higher, and further 
than the human pirates. Zelda stepped sideways to accept the flying one. 
Rei stepped forward to accept the running one.

Zelda pointed her weapon into the air for the pirate to impale himself 
on, but the pirate just soared right over her head. She whirled around 
to face him, and was slammed with the broadside of his arm, sending her 
flying back. She skidded along the floor, scrambling to get up while in 
motion.

Rei tilted her sword and swung, reaching far forward. The pirate just 
waved his hand over the flat part of the blade, pushing it to the side, 
and connecting his huge fist with her face. The energy blade followed 
and hit her chest. She too was sent flying back, into the cage. She 
observed her chest, and found that there was no wound. Her face didn&#39;t 
feel broken either. She was glad the armor had protected her, in some 
odd way. She went to stand up, but almost collapsed from a sudden 
exhaustion. The pirate came barreling down on her again, this time to 
crush her against the cage with his arm. She found the energy to roll 
back, but was still being drained by something. Then she noticed the 
winglets glowing furiously. She calmed herself down, and they dimmed to 
their usual pulse. She felt recharged. Again came the pirate, but this 
time he circled around her.

Zelda lurched up to her feet once she slowed down a bit. The pirate had 
grabbed a boulder from a pile next to a recently mined section. He 
lunged forward and hurled the boulder. Zelda used her fire and slowed 
the boulder, not enough though. She rolled to the side to evade the 
boulder. Suddenly the pirate was behind her, having hidden behind the 
moving boulder. She didn&#39;t notice until it grabbed her from behind, 
pinning her arms to her side. She struggled to get free, but the pirate 
bearhugged her, crushing her into it&#39;s massive chest. She screamed in 
pain. Her armor was just helping him in this case. She though furiously, 
looking at her situation. The pirate grabbed her naginata and threw it 
to the floor. Zelda suddenly remembered her spell. She dissapeared from 
the pirate&#39;s arms with a gust of wind. She reappeared at her weapon and 
picked it up. The pirate glared at her angrily, and fired multiple 
blasts at her from his gun. Zelda brought up her barrier, deflecting the 
shots,  and then broke her shield, sending shards of it the pirate. He 
was hit, but it didn&#39;t affect him much.

&quot;Oh no.&quot; Zelda groaned as the pirate came at her again. He hurled his 
fist at her, and she stepped back, only to be greeted by his blade, 
which she locked with her weapon.


Samus dashed quickly through the tunnels, wondering where the pirates 
went. She came around a corner, to find a full offense of lazer fire, 
and quickly ducked behind the corner. There were two pirates blasting 
away at her. Setting her gun, she armed herself with her plasma beam, 
and rolled out from her hiding spot, firing like mad. One pirate was 
caught off guard and was struck in the chest and belly, while the other 
managed to duck and roll behind some crates. Samus held her position 
after the roll and focused on the first pirate&#39;s head, firing madly. He 
finally backed off and hopped behind some crates. Samus ignited her 
blade and dashed towards him. The other pirate ran the crate he had 
towards Samus, giving her only a split second second to jump onto the 
crate and slash down, before hopping over the pirate and landing behind 
him. She realized that they had their old melee weapon, the reversed arm 
mounted energy blade. The pirate halted movement and grabbed the box 
once Samus landed. The other pirate threw his crate at Samus, and she 
ducked. Then the pirate in front of her whirled around with the crate in 
his arms, forcing her to roll back. She activated her plasma beam again, 
and charged up a shot. The first pirate jumped up in her direction, 
firing at her. Samus jumped up, avoiding the first shots and placing her 
foot right in front of the pirate. They both went flying towards the 
wall, the pirate with a foot and a pain in his face. Samus turned around 
and grabbed onto a ledge. This was a verticle room, that seemed to lead 
all the way to the surface, with winding stairways, and enough space 
sideways to fit a medium sized cargo transporter. She pulled her way up, 
and met with the other pirate, who plowed his foot into Samus&#39;s helmet, 
sending her plummeting into the ground, where the first was waiting to 
hammer her into the ground. She rolled out of the way just in time to 
avoid the first hammerfist, but he brought his massive clenched fists 
back up, connecting with Samus&#39;s face again. She went flying back, but 
not without sending her fully charged blast of plasma into the pirate. 
His right side was completely burned, and his arm missing. He screamed 
with rage, and Samus went crashing into a stack of crates. The second 
pirate, from above, jumped down, attempting to crush Samus under his 
weight, with the added force of gravity. She tried to move, but was 
stuck in the pile of shattered crates, and the pirate came down with 
enough force to have splattered a normal human on contact. Samus flexed 
her chest muscles to resist his force, then exhaled letting the armor 
take the rest of the weight. The chestplate cracked. The pirate raised 
his fists and came down on her head.


Zelda was thrown clear across the room, splashing into the underground 
spring, and almost impaling herself on a rock spike. She planted her 
weapon into the ground, and thrust herself up. The pirate was already on 
her, firing his lazer endlessly. He was serious now. Zelda had proven a 
worthy foe after impaling him right through the chest. He swung has 
massive fist in rage, and Zelda sidestepped. She moved again as the 
other fist came her way, and she blocked the energy blade that followed. 
She jumped and kicked him twice in the face, and landed, spinning around 
and slashing him in the face with her blade. Blood sprayed and he 
stumbled back. He looked back at her, anger in his eyes, but no fear 
whatsoever. Zelda gripped her naginata, ready to take him on again. He 
had already gone through at least 8 attack runs, but he didn&#39;t seem to 
be slowing his offense.

Rei parried the slash from her pirate&#39;s blade, and slid past, pushing 
it&#39;s arm around and thrusting her sword into it&#39;s knee joint from behind 
the leg. The pirate reached behind him and grabbed her head. He threw 
her into the wall next to the cage, then pulled the sword out of his 
leg. He bled a lot, and was clenching his knee tightly, snarling. Rei 
rolled back from the wall, facing the pirate, unarmed. Her sword was too 
far for her to run, and she didn&#39;t know how well he could still move.

Appearantly, very well, as he charged forward, blood spurting from his 
wound. He hurled himself at her, shoulder first. Rei leaned towards the 
ground and carried him over her head, into the wall.

&quot;Now you know how much it hurts you worm!&quot; She yelled. She turned and 
ran for her sword. Picking it up and whirling around she saw him coming 
at her again. This time he circled her, carefully choosing when to come 
in for a strike. Rei heard a splintering sound, and the pirate 
collapsed, hands over his knee, screaming in pain. Rei walked over to 
him, smiling.

&quot;Now dog, you die.&quot; She hissed. He roard and fired at her. She parried 
his shots quickly and she sliced his head off all in one fluid movement.

&quot;Let&#39;s just see you keep fighting now&quot; She turned to look at Zelda.

She was backing towards a wall, with the pirate advancing on her. Rei 
ran in as fast as she could, and Zelda hit the wall. The pirate swung 
his blade arm at her, and she jumped up the wall and off of it, soaring 
over his head. She landed and recieved his charging slash. He pulled 
three more lightening fast swipes, which she parried, spun to the 
ground, and sliced his head off. The head fell to the ground, and the 
body soon after, making a thud as it landed.

&quot;Whew! That was a workout.&quot; Zelda panted.

&quot;Tell me about it.&quot; Rei concurred, running up to her. &quot;Now let&#39;s save 
the captives.&quot;

Zelda nodded in agreement, and they walked towards the cage.

&quot;What about the one who ran off? Shouldn&#39;t one of use go and take it 
out?&quot; Zelda asked Rei, as she drove her blade into the lock.

&quot;He&#39;s probably gone by now. But we&#39;ll let whoever&#39;s here as well chase 
after him. We&#39;ve done enough fighting already.&quot;

The blade was no use, so Zelda put her hands on the lockpad. It glowed 
red, and exploded. The prisoners pushed to get out of the cage, and the 
girls let them out. One among the group was a blue haired, handsome 
young man.

&quot;These pirates have my magical sword. If I may, I know where it is and I 
would like to retrieve it.&quot; He inquired. Rei nodded and he strode off.

&quot;Come right back here when you get it!&quot; She yelled.

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we have someone accompany him? There might be more pirates.&quot;

&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll go look after him.&quot; Rei dashed after the man. Zelda turned 
around to look at the people.

&quot;So are you all the staff for the tournament?&quot; Zelda asked. The group 
nodded. &quot;Why did the pirates kidnap you all?&quot;

&quot;We had made a deal with a company a while ago. We were low on money, so 
the tournament&#39;s stuff would have been limited, or maybe the whole thing 
cancelled. We couldn&#39;t let that happen.&quot;

&quot;We made a deal with this company, that we would borrow a lot of money 
from them, to pay for the tournament.&quot;

&quot;We had no clue they were the pirates.&quot;

&quot;We managed to raise the money we needed to pay them back, but it was 
stolen, and the pirates did it. The company we borrowed money from 
demanded we pay them back, or something bad would happen.&quot;

&quot;When we told them that the pirates had stolen the money, they got 
angry, raided our company, and kidnapped us, forcing us to work off our 
debts, even though they already took the money back.&quot;

&quot;The company was really the pirates.&quot;

&quot;But we had worked off our debt already and they wouldn&#39;t let us go.  
They were going to perform some freak experiment on us. We are so glad 
you came before they did that.&quot;

&quot;Not a problem. This is our first mission so... it was a good 
experience.&quot; Zelda told them. They were all staring at her, and she 
heard whispers.

&quot;Their first time and they took out a whole force of pirates, and two 
real ones.&quot; &quot;These girls are really skilled.&quot; &quot;They must work out.&quot; &quot;I 
wanna get one&#39;s autograph.&quot; &quot;She&#39;s really cute.&quot; &quot;Shut up&quot;

Zelda sighed.

Men. She thought. Good for nothings.

Rei and the warrior returned. When Zelda saw his sword, she was 
impressed. It reminded her of the master sword.

&quot;Okay folks, we gotta get out of here and get you back to HQ.&quot; Rei 
shouted, punching her fist into the air. They entire group ran up 
through the passages.


Samus was thrown into a wall, full force, her visor shattered, exposing 
her face underneath. Her left shoulder pad had already been bashed off. 
Her non gun arm was battered, and she had trouble moving it.

Why are these two giving me so much trouble? I haven&#39;t given them hardly 
any damage. I&#39;ve forgotten how to fight them.

The huge fist came at her again, and she shielded her face with her gun 
arm. She noticed the other pirate, the one with the burn, picking up a 
long metal pole, that was sharp enough to be a spear.  He turned and ran 
at her, full sprint, ready to drive the pole into her 
soon-to-be-lifeless torso. She started panicking, and was hit in the 
stomach. The armor cracked there as well. She  looked at the pirate who 
was pinning her to the wall, clenching her teeth. She went into a rage 
and threw up her left arm, her non gun arm, and grabbed the pirate&#39;s 
arm. He drew his fist back for another punch, and the other pirate was 
drawing ever closer. Samus lowered herself, then jumped up with all her 
strength, and dragged the pirate into the wall, where he was impaled by 
his friend. He screamed and let Samus go, grasping the pole that was now 
driven into his upper torso from behind, and locked him into the wall. 
Samus ignited her sword, and came down on the pirate&#39;s head, driving it 
in with all her might. She ripped the blade out, and slashed at the 
other pirate. She jumped down as he backed up. He swung his fist at her 
again, and she moved sideways, lunging forward, driving the energy blade 
into his chest. He grabbed her helmet, and she pushed the blade up. He 
kicked her in the stomach, sending both of them crashing down to the 
floor. Samus heard another crack in her helmet, and she could swear she 
felt it caving in. She drove her sword up desperately, ripping it 
through the pirates upper torso, and out it&#39;s head. Her helmet 
collapsed, caving in on her head. She screamed, but the pirate&#39;s 
strength ended before it crushed her head. The pirate had collapsed onto 
her body, and she pushed it off, with difficulty. Her face had scrapes 
and very shallow cuts. She felt light bleeding on her head. Her computer 
was damaged in the fight, so she was unable to read her suit&#39;s or her 
body&#39;s damage. She forced herself up. Looking at the pirates who lay 
dead on the ground, she almost whimpered.

Why did she have that much trouble with them. Never before had they been 
that difficult to kill. She walked through the door, and continued on.

Eventually she found the room with two other pirate bodies. The only 
blood she could find was the blood of the pirates&#39;, and no traces of the 
other warrior. There were obviously prisoners, as there was an opened 
cage. The lock had been blown to dust. Samus could see no other way out, 
except for her exit, and  on at the far end of the room. There was no 
evidence to say if the warrior had experienced any trouble with these 
pirates.

When samus returned to the surface, she climbed up the side of her ship, 
and dropped inside. She closed the hatch and initiated lift off. The 
other warrior had left no traces of his ship, so Samus had no clue how 
long ago he had left. She went into her room as the ship lifted off. 
Sitting down, she pulled off the numerous pieces of armor. It hurt to 
pull it off because most of it had been severely damaged. She tossed 
them into her closet, and closed the doors. She had programmed the ship 
to enter space and just drift. She collapsed on the bed, eyes closed. 
She was whimpering, a small tear streaming from her eye.

Then she just let loose, and cried heavily, face into her bed.

She had just chased down a group of the REAL pirates, and almost gotten 
hammered into space dust by the asteroid field. When she landed she 
found dozens of dead pirates, wiped out with incredible skill and speed, 
as most were still alive when she found them. She had fought a hundred 
battles previously, but this was her worst. Two of the five pirates that 
she encountered, had beaten her almost to her death. She touched her 
face, feeling the cuts, which would soon be scars. She was an inch from 
death. Another second and she would not be in her comfortable bed now. 
She had been beaten, and never even found out who the other warrior was.

&quot;Beaten by an unknown force. How dare you.&quot; She cried. She almost wanted 
the pirate to have finished her, crushed her head, and ended it all. But 
she had to fight, and survive. She remained there and wept for hours.


Zelda and Rei walked out of the bounty hunter&#39;s HQ, putting away their 
half a million credits each. They were back home.

&quot;Well. We finished that, and we still have a day or so before work.&quot; Rei 
reminded Zelda.

&quot;We can search out a bounty here.&quot; Zelda suggested. They both thought a 
moment, and shrugged off the idea. Both of them were dog tired from 
their previous mission, and neither of them was interested.

&quot;Let&#39;s go back home.&quot; Zelda said. Rei nodded, and the two walked back to 
their ship, holding each other&#39;s hands.


(WHEW!!! I agree with the girls on that one. I am exhausted after just 
writing about it. Again, sorry folks for making any long boring periods. 
I have yet to read over my own work, so I don&#39;t know how bad it is. Can 
anyone guess what the pirates are doing?

Poor Samus. It kinda hurt me when I was writing that part. I mean, she 
is probably the coolest female hero ever. And she is also beautiful, 
like &quot;gouge my eyes out, because I&#39;m positive that kind of beauty is 
forbidden for me to see.&quot; Or &quot;someone shoot me she&#39;s beautiful.&quot; No 
offense to my girlfriend.

By the way... Zelda and Rei knew each other for 4 days before they had 
their special scene. Don&#39;t be worrying about any kind of seduction or 
rushing into relationships. I know that storywise they didn&#39;t spend all 
that much time together. Okay so 4 days isn&#39;t that much time anyway, but 
it&#39;s better than going that far in the first night

We got more Zelda and Rei, and Samus coming up soon, so keep reading.)
