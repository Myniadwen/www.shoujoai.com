<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><font 
size="2">There's someone I have to see first. </font></i></span><span style="font-family: 
'Arial';"><font size="2">A tall aqua haired girl thought to herself as she walked out of the 
hospital. This would be the last time for her to walk through these doors. She just talked 
to her doctor who gave her the news that she wouldn't live that long anymore. Not that it 
came as a surprise. She had been coughing blood for almost a week now. Not to mention how 
she had suffered trying to pick up things just because her muscles didn't work with her 
anymore.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">It had been a week ago since her bodyguard and best friend died because of a rape 
inflicted by that damn Kaku. She sure as hell would make Kaku suffer a fate worse than that. 
But no, she wasn't the one she was going to see.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">After walking straight for a half hour she finally reached her destination. A sigh 
escaped her lips as an uneasiness washed over her. What is </font></span><span 
style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><font size="2">she</font></i></span><span 
style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font size="2"> wasn't home. What if </font></span><span 
style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><font size="2">she </font></i></span><span 
style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font size="2">wasn't interested in listening? She tried to 
shake the thought off as she knocked on the door. For a few seconds which seemed like hours 
it stayed quiet. And then finally she could hear someone move behind the other side of the 
door. </font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><font 
size="2">She</font></i></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font size="2"> probably 
would be very angry. Yes, probably.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Slowly the door opened, revealing a blue haired girl with a eyepatch covering one 
of her eyes. At first the girl didn't look up, she seemed tired. Maybe hse had been up all 
night. But then when she realized who was standing in front of her she looked up in shock. 
Her eye widened, full of disbelieve. But mostly, full of hate and anger. ''Ryofu Housen.'' 
She spat.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">The aqua haired girl smiled a bit. The girl in front of her was no one less than 
Ryomou Shimei. The girl she had raped when she had come for the man she loved. The man Ryofu 
had suppossedly killed. ''Ryofu Housen.'' Ryofu repeated, putting a hand through her aqua 
colored hair. ''You have no idea how much I had to suffer because of that 
name.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''What do you want?'' The blue haired girl asked in anger. Ryofu was the last 
person she wanted to see. After their last encounter she had hoped to never see that person 
again. Unlike Ryofu who was dressed in Rakuyou's school uniform, a red blazer and matching 
skirt, Ryomou herself was dressed in a simple blue t-shirt and white 
pants.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Can I come in?'' Ryofu asked, trying not to sound like her usual 
self.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''No.'' Came the reply. ''And if you have nothing to say to me that is of any use 
then....''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''You and Hakufu,'' Ryofu interrupted the other girl. ''You're going to fight 
Toutaku.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Ryomou was taken aback by this comment. If Ryofu knew this then Toutaku surely knew 
too. ''Don't worry.'' Ryofu whispered as she bent over a little. Her face was close enough 
to Ryomou's to feel each other's breaths. ''I didn't tell him. Saji told 
me.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><font 
size="2">'Ah Saji.'</font></i></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font size="2"> 
Ryomou thought. </font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><font 
size="2">'Ofcourse Saji, who else?'</font></i></span><span style="font-family: 
'Arial';"><font size="2"> After what seemed like a few minutes she stepped aside. 
''Enter.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">----</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Ryofu took a good look at the living room of the blue haired girl. She surely 
hadn't been expecting Ryomou to be a tidy person. How she was proven wrong. Then again, she 
didn't really know Ryomou that well except for the girl's ''secret'' love for Saji Genpou. 
''Nice place.'' Ryofu said before sitting down on the black leather couch. She was now 
facing a black chair on which the eyepatched girl sat down. The only thing that stood 
between them was the white table. ''Aren't you going to offer me a 
drink?''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Stop acting like a guest.'' Ryomou spat. ''Why </font></span><span 
style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><font size="2">are</font></i></span><span 
style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font size="2"> you here?'' She surely wasn't in the mood for 
small talk.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">The aqua haired girl smirked a bit. Ryomou still seemed to be taken off guard. 
''Shocked to find me on your front steps.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''What do you want Ryofu Housen? If you've got nothing to tell me or say then just 
fuck off before I...'' She was cut off.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Before you do what exactly?'' Ryofu wondered out loud. It didn't seem like your 
typical question or a question at all. ''Last time you </font></span><span 
style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><font size="2">did </font></i></span><span 
style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font size="2">something it cost you your virginity. At least, 
I wasn't so sure of that since..''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Shut up!'' The blue haired girl yelled. This time interrupting the other. ''If 
you came here to remind me on how you managed to defeat me then please stop bothering. We 
can finish it right here and now.'' Ryomou jumped up. ''Come on. Let's fight. You and 
me.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Ryofu blinked in confusion before bursting out into fits of laughter. Ofcourse this 
pissed of the eyepatch wearing girl even more. ''Oh Shimei. I had no idea that you were that 
desperate to get some lovin'. I'll be happy to fight you again. But I'm afraid you'll lose 
again in the state you're in right now.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''W-what?'' The other sounded offended. Who wouldn't?</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Ryofu shook her head and leanded back into the couch. ''What I'm saying is that you 
need to get stronger Ryomou. Much stronger.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Don't get so cocky. You were lucky the last time. I just didn't see it coming. 
That's all.'' Ryomou swallowed. Why was it that she somewhat felt sorry for the girl sitting 
in front of her? That damned girl raped her! She humilitated her! Why would anyone feel 
sorry for that bitch?!</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Not me Shimei. You'd be able to defeat me. If you wanted.'' Ryofu sighed, not 
looking at the girl in front of her. ''I'm not here to fight. I just wanted to talk. You and 
Sonsaku Hakufu.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">These words calmed Ryomou down a bit. Her eye focussed on nothing but the girl in 
front of her. ''I want you to kill Toutaku.'' Ryofu finally said after a 
while.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Why? He's your leader isn't he? Or are you trying to say you're doing this for 
Saji. To prove how loyal you can be?''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Finally Ryofu looked up at the blue haired girl. ''Not for Saji. Not for anyone but 
me.'' She paused. ''According to my written fate as a toushi I'll betray Toutaku. Eventually 
me and Chinkyuu get killed by his hand. Or Kaku's. Who cares.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Chinkyuu? Kaku?'' Ryomou repeated, trying to figure out where she had heard those 
names before.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">It stayed quiet for a while until the aqua haired girl spoke up. ''Chinkyuu...'' It 
was nothing but a whisper but Ryomou didn't miss the hint of sadness attached to that 
name.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Is she what you wanted to talk about?'' Ryomou's voice softened up a bit but she 
still stayed on her guard.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Toutaku had her raped. She died just a few hours ago in the hospital.'' Ryofu 
said. Suddenly her eyes grew cold again as if the last bit of emotion she was trying tohide 
finally vanished. The sudden change somewhat scared Ryomou. ''Chinkyuu wasn't suppossed to 
die like that. We're here to be faithful to our past isn't it? I was suppossed to die 
first.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''A little change in history doesn't mean everything has changed. One death 
can't....''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Shut up Shimei. You don't get it do you. For who do you live? For who do you 
fight? Yourself! remember that Shimei. You fight for no one but yourself. Fuck Saji and fuck 
your destiny.'' Ryofu seemed angry all of a sudden. ''You can fight against your destiny. I 
won't die by </font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><font size="2">his 
</font></i></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font size="2">hand. And I surely 
won't be a toy of this </font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><font 
size="2">fate!</font></i></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">The blue haired girl put a hand through her hair. Why was Ryofu telling her this 
now? ''You want me to kill Toutaku for you so you'll stay alive?''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''I'll die anyway Shimei. Don't worry. I'll get what we deserve. But I need Toutaku 
to see that in the end we all get what we deserve. Toushi. It's about time that word lost a 
meaning forever.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><font 
size="2">'Die anyway? Die anyway? What the hell are you talking about Ryofu? Why are you 
talking in riddles, is it that hard to just tell what you want?'</font></i></span><span 
style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font size="2"> Ryomou sighed. ''If you're trying to 
manipulate me then I have to tell you that you're bad at it.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Manipulate?'' Ryofu repeated. ''Don't you have me all figured out.'' Could've 
that come out any less sarcastic? ''I'm asking you because you're the only I know who 
could.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''You're aiming at Hakufu.'' Ryomou hissed. </font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Ryofu shook her head. ''Not everyone is trying to double cross you Shimei. I heard 
how Sonsaku fought you and how you lost. But you're still here aren't you? You're the most 
down to earth person I know.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Why don't you fight him if you're going to die anyway?''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Because,'' Suddenly Ryofu stopped talking. For a moment it seems like she was 
feeling sick and was going to puke. Then, just when it looked like she went back to her 
normal state she started to cough.Quickly Ryofu covered her mouth with her hand, looking 
away as she did. As if she was embarressed all of a sudden.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Ryofu...'' Ryomou started. ''Are you...''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">And then suddenly she noticed how Ryofu's hand which had been covering her mouth 
was now covered in blood. </font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><font 
size="2">'Sick. Ryofu's sick!'</font></i></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2"> She stood up, walking over at the aqua haired girl. ''Do you need anything? 
Water?''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Ryofu removed her hand from her mouth, licking up some of her own blood with her 
tongue. ''Tastes salty.'' She said. ''I don't need anything. Sit down 
Ryomou.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">For some reason the blue haired girl obeyed and sat down on the couch next to the 
other. ''My,my...'' Ryofu said gazing at Ryomou. ''Aren't you close.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Is that...this...'' Ryomou looked down at her feet which suddenly were the most 
interesting things in the world. ''Why you won't fight?''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''.............''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''What?''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''It's a disease which causes your muscles to,'' She paused. ''Never mind. The 
heart is a muscle. Don't forget. Google it or something.'' There was another pause. This 
time longer than the first. For a moment it even seemed like she wasn't even going to 
continue her sentence. Uncomfortable silence. Very, very uncomfortable. No one knew who had 
to speak up anymore. </font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">After a while it was Ryofu who spoke up. ''I'll fight. But I need you to promise 
me...'' She waited for Ryomou to look up. When it seemed like the blue haired girl wasn't 
moving she placed her hands on Ryomou's cheeks, making her face her. ''We would've made a 
great team. If only...'' A sigh escaped her lips. ''No... we wouldn't have, would 
we?''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Ryomou didn't say anything. She was too caught up in her own thoughts. Besides, 
whwat was there to say?</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Promise me... fight for no one but yourself.'' And with that Ryofu did something 
unexpected enough that even the eyepatch wearing girl couldn't react to it. Ryofu kissed 
her. At first the kiss was rather innocent but then the aqua haired girl slipped her tongue 
in the other's mouth.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Ryomou could taste the blood Ryofu had licked up earlier. For a moment she closed 
her eyes, letting the other girl have her way with her. But then, when it finally hit her 
what was happening she pushed Ryofu away. Which, compared to when they fought, seemed a 
rather easy thing to do. ''What </font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><font 
size="2">are </font></i></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font size="2">you 
doing?!''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''A while back you wanted to fight, didn't you Shimei?'' Ryofu smiled. Something 
Ryomou hadn't seen her do before. She had seen her smirk but never seen her smile sincerely. 
She watched the aqua haired girl stand up. ''Keep your promise. After all, we kissed on 
it.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''You...'' Ryomou wanted to get angry, yell and hit the girl who stood in front of 
her. But she knew she couldn't or wouldn't.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''I'll see you soon. Ryomou.'' That was the first time Ryofu finally adressed her 
as 'Ryomou' instead of te usual 'Shimei'. The aqua haired girl turned around and took a few 
steps towards the door. ''Don't bother getting up. I know the way out.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Ryofu wait!'' Ryomou yelled, jumping up from the couch. The aqua haired girl 
stopped dead in her tracks, waiting for the blue haired girl to say whatever she had on her 
mind. After what seemed like an eternity of silence she shook her head and started to walk 
towards the door again. </font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font

<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Later....''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font

<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">------</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Toutaku-sama!'' A black haired girl with glasses yelled after her leader ''You 
can't. Ryofu's going to...'' She immidiately stopped talking the moment Toutaku turned 
around. He was looking at her with a crazed look in his eyes. Kaku couldn't help it but 
compare her master to a monster. After all, he </font></span><span style="font-family: 
'Arial';"><i><font size="2">was </font></i></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">a monster. That was probably one of the reasons Ryofu was coming 
here.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Ryofu Housen had already made her way up to Rakuyou, killing every toushi who tried 
to stop her from reaching Toutaku. In fact, it wasn't Toutaku's life Kaku feared. But her 
own. By her hand Chinkyuu died.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">As if to read her mind Toutaku smirked. ''Are you afraid of Ryofu Housen?'' He 
asked, licking his lips. ''I for one am not. I tried to think of a possible way to get 
someone strong enough to face Ryofu but that would be a mistake. If I truly want to overcome 
whatever destiny lies in store for me. I'll have to fix this little problem myself. And 
you're coming with me Kaku.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">The last part was added with such a tone of voice it send shivers to Kaku's spine. 
''Me?'' Why? She couldn't fight. Although she was a toushi she was specialized in everything 
</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><font 
size="2">but</font></i></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font size="2"> 
fighting!</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Not to fight,'' Once again he answered a question unasked. ''I want to piss Ryofu 
off. You had that lapdog Chinkyuu killed. I'd like to see her reaction to 
you.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Kaku swallowed hard, fearing for her life. ''Alright.'' She finally said once he 
kept staring at her, obviously waiting for a reaction.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font

<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Ryomou leaned against the stone wall, staring at the full white moon. It was such a 
pretty sight. A sigh escaped her lips as she closed her eyes. What was this nervous feeling 
in her heart? Why did she have the feeling something was going terribly wrong. Sonsaku was 
ok. She just confirmed it by calling Syuyu Koukin. But she knew that already, didn't 
she?</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">It was Ryofu she was worrying about. Since their last time together Ryomou had come 
to doubt a lot of things she thought she knew. She moved one hand up, placing it over her 
eyepatch. This fate, could she really change it?</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">She opened her eyes again. ''Ryofu,'' It was nothing but a whisper. ''I am going to 
change our fate. By changing yours first'' Quickly she dropped her hand and turned around. 
She had to go to Rakuyou. Ryofu might still be there.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font

<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Toutaku Chuuei!'' A voice yelled causing Kaku to jump up and turn around. Toutaku 
on the other hand was still sitting on the ground, bend over his watermelons. ''Kaku?'' The 
aqua haired beauty in the doorway asked. She certainly hadn't been expecting that bitch to 
be here.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''You came.'' Toutaku stated as a matter of factly. ''How unexpected. Toushi are 
totally worthless, aren't they? Losing to one single girl. What kind of fighters are they if 
they can't even protect their leader from a single girl?''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Ryofu clenched her fists. ''What are you talking about now?''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Finally he stood up, his back still pointed at the aqua haired girl. ''It doesn't 
have to be this way Housen.'' He could feel Ryofu's eyes burn through his back. ''Kaku...'' 
He paused for a moment to finally turn around to face the two girls. ''I'll have to sacrife 
your body.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''W-what?'' Kaku took a step back into the direction of the entrance. In front of 
her stood no longer Toutaku Chuuei but a beast hungry for power. He pointed his hand at her. 
And in a flash of a second he blasted a chi blast into her direction. Unable to escape the 
attack Kaku could feel a burning pain in her stomach. And then, everything went 
black.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Ryofu just stared at Kaku who fell to the ground bleeding. The black haired girl 
was still breathing slowly yet painfully. ''A random act of violence, to scare me Toutaku?'' 
Ryofu demanded.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Toutaku smirked. ''It's her fault after all. If she hadn't had that little Chinkyuu 
raped then we wouldn't be standing here, right?''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Do you really think this is going to help?'' The girl asked, raising an eyebrow. 
She had to look confident. One sign of weakness and he would use it against her. Then again, 
she wasn't sure whether he hadn't noticed already. She hadn't made one move since she threw 
those goddamn glass doors open. Her body was failing her already. She couldn't move her legs 
nor hands. In fact, she was completely useless by now.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''No.'' He said. ''Ofcourse not.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">With that said Toutaku started walking up to Ryofu who was still trying to remain 
her cool composure. ''Don't come any closer or I swear I'll kill you.'' Ryofu warned him but 
he just smiled upon hearing that.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Try, Housen. Try.'' He was now standing close enough that he could feel her 
breath on his face. ''Or is there a problem?''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Ryofu's eyes widened. He knew. He had known all along. ''You 
bastard!''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">The brown haired man laughed hard. It sounded completely inhuman, insane even. 
''Human beings are so much fun! Trying to fight even though they're obviously too weak to 
even bother.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Toutaku!'' Ryofu yelled as tears fell down her cheeks. She knew he loved to see 
her like this but she couldn't stop. It was too much. At the end of the day she was just one 
girl. The man who was responsible for all the hurt in her life was standing in front of her 
and she couldn't do anything about it. There was no one left to save her either. She had 
lost the only person who gave a damn. </font></span><span style="font-family: 
'Arial';"><i><font size="2">'I am sorry Chinkyuu. After all, I'm still too 
weak...'</font></i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">She closed her eyes, letting the tears fall from her face. ''Go ahead. I'm tired 
anyway.'' She finally said. She could hear the man in front of her stop laughing and step 
closer. She could feel his hands around her throat. Yet she kept her eyes closed. She wasn't 
going to show him the hurt he had caused. She wouldn't give him that satisfaction. His hands 
were cold, surrounding her, choking the last bit of air out of her.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><font 
size="2">Chinkyuu...</font></i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Just when she was about to lose consciousness she could feel his grip around her 
throat weaken and eventually he let go of her completely. She fell to the ground, landing on 
her knees just in time. Her eyes flew open. ''Toutaku!'' Did he intend on making her suffer? 
Wasn't it enough already. She was expecting to face him but instead she was looking right 
into the eye of a blue haired girl.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Ryomou?'' She sounded shocked. Why was she here now?</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">The eyepatched girl smiled a bit and bend down, taking Ryofu's numb body in her 
arms. ''I promised didn't I?'' The girl asked. Her voice was full emotion. As if she was 
just two seconds away from crying. ''We kissed on it, didn't we?''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">The aqua haired girl rested her head against Ryomou's chest and smiled. ''I didn't 
think...'' She coughed, blood dripping from her lips. ''You would 
come...''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''You bitch!'' It suddenly sounded. Ryofu was too tired to look up. She already 
knew what had happened. She even knew what was going to happen. Either way, only one of them 
would walk away breathing at the end of this evening.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Toutaku spit out some blood while placing a hand on his cheek. ''I hadn't seen that 
one coming. Ryomou Shimei.'' He said. The blue haired girl just glared at him. Could she 
win? Did she really stand a chance now he was expecting her?</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''I'm sorry Ryofu. I have to leave for a moment.'' The eyepatched girl said with an 
apologie, gently lying Ryofu in the grass. It was strange to see Ryofu like this, so weak, 
so tired.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''You can join her soon.'' Toutaku smirked before pointing his hand at Ryomou like 
he had done earlier with Kaku. Without any hesitation he fired a chi blast at her which she 
avoided with ease. Immidiately she jumped up to him. If he would just stay where she was now 
she knew she could easily break his neck. She was, after all, the master in 
locks.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">She wrapped one leg around Toutaku's neck, hanging herself upside down against his 
back, closing the lock with her other leg. At the same time she was holding one of his arms 
in her hand, making sure that if he tried to move either his neck or arm would 
break.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''It's really amazing.'' She heard him say. There was not even the slightest sign 
of pain in his voice. In fact, he sounded more amused by her actions. ''How you think this 
still counts as a street fight.'' He lifted his left, remaining arm up, taking Ryomou's leg 
in his hand.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''W-what are you doing?!'' The blue haired girl yelled. She could feel how he 
tightened the grip around her leg. If he continued to put that much strenght in it she was 
surely the only one walking away with broken limbs. In an attempt to keep him from doing so 
she tried twisting his arm. In vain unfortunately. He had too much power in his arm for her 
to even move it in the first place.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Was she going to die now? Was this truly the way it was going to 
end?</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Then without any notice Ryomou suddenly fell to the ground. Not bothering to 
recover she looked up to see what just had happened. She was now looking at Ryofu who was 
lying on top of Toutaku. Her eyes were closed and for a moment Ryomou had rendered the aqua 
haired beauty dead. It was then she noticed the tightened grip Ryofu had on Toutaku's 
back.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''What are you doing now?'' The brown haired sadist wanted to know. He wasn't even 
bothering to push her off. After all, the girl was close to dying. There was nothing she 
could possibly do anymore.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Going against my fate and actually causing it.'' She spoke in a whisper, her eyes 
still closed. ''How pathetic is that? But it doesn't matter. In the end I 
win.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Win?'' Toutaku laughed slightly. ''You won nothing woman! What can you accomplish 
by dying? There's only use in killing.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Ryofu smiled a bit. ''How about it if I kill you?'' He just laughed giving Ryofu 
time to finally face the blue haired girl. ''Ryomou...'' She coughed. ''Thank you.'' With 
that said she turned her attention back to the man beneath her. ''Toutaku, you truly are a 
sad person.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''Oh?'' </font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''You weren't capable of chaning your fate in the end.'' She knew he thought he had 
done just that by making sure she'd die before him. ''In the end, I did...'' She coughed 
again, spitting blood all over the man's chest.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">It hadn't been until now that Toutaku started to fear the girl on top of him. What 
was she talking about?!</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''You and I will die together,'' She closed her eyes again. ''I don't think that 
was in history.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">He sat up, pulling her up as well. Her hands never losing the grip on his back. ''I 
wear the magatama. Not the other way around!'' Her eyes opened, glancing at Ryomou. 
''Remember that.''</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''W-wait!'' The eyepatched girl yelled, trying to get up. Unfortunately her severed 
leg wouldn't let her move from her position.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">''You bitch, let go!'' Toutaku tried to push the aqua haired girl off who suddenly 
was too strong again.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Ryofu smiled down at him. ''Jisai....Rekkouha!'' She yelled, blasting a chi blast 
through Toutaku's back and herself.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">Ryomou's eyes widened in horror. All she could see was blood. And then a loud thump 
of two bodies lying on the ground.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><font 
size="2">Chinkyuu...</font></i></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><font

<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><i><font

<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">The blue haired girl quickly jumped up ignoring the pain in her leg, running over 
to Ryofu's body. Something inside of her still hoped that Ryofu had survived that blast. 
Ryomou fell down on her knees again. ''Ryofu!'' She tried shaking the girl. When that didn't 
have any effect she lowered her head on the girl's chest to see if her heart was still 
beating.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">A tear fell down her cheek when it hit her. When she finally realised that Ryofu 
Housen was no longer part of this world. ''AAAAH!'' She cried, burrying her head in the dead 
girl's chest. </font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">-----</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font 
size="2">One hour later Ryomou finally stopped crying. She had no idea why Ryofu's death 
affected her this much. It just did. She slowly placed a small kiss on the dead girl's lips 
before gently lying her down on the ground again. </font></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font
