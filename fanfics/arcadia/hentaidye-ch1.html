<h1>Not Enemies, If Only Just For Now</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../arcadia/index.html">Skies of Arcadia</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hentaidye.html">Hentai-Dye</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Yafutoma was very...different. That much was easy enough to agree on for 
anyone from the rest of Arcadia&#39;s settled islands. That quality of this 
difference was what was not agreed on. Aside from ogling at the exotic 
women, whistling appreciatively at them when appropriate (from his own 
perspective, anyways), Vigoro had made it apparent that this difference 
wasn&#39;t one he especially enjoyed. It wasn&#39;t entirely surprising, of 
course: one of the non-female things that Vigoro appreciated most was 
blatant strength and power. Yafutoma&#39;s obvious closely-followed values 
of craft and balance in their food, architecture, political system, and 
personal nature was unimpressive to him at best. He would take the heavy 
atmosphere of Valua over this place any day.

So, what he was doing was far from shocking now that there was a little 
down-time after docking at the unknown land&#39;s capital, opening friendly 
diplomatic relations with the country, immediately severing those 
relations by endorsing a hostile coup against its ruler, and personally 
searching until boredom set in for Vyse, Fina, Enrique, and especially 
Aika. What he was doing was the same as he did just about every time he 
was freshly landed in a city: eyeing women and babbling incessantly 
about how much he wanted them, how much they wanted him, and when and 
where this imagined mutual desire would be fit into his cluttered 
nightly schedule.

It was beginning to grate on Belleza&#39;s nerves a bit.

&quot;Oh ho! Look at that young beauty!&quot; Vigoro exclaimed without much 
attempt at discretion, jerking his head to indicate a slim, younger 
Yafutoman woman watching he and Belleza stroll down the path. &quot;She can&#39;t 
keep her eyes off me. Not that I blame her; why, if there weren&#39;t so 
many lovely ladies to gaze on, I probably wouldn&#39;t be able to take my 
eyes off me, either!&quot;

Belleza deepened the frown of annoyance which had settled on her face 
some time before. An interest in visitors so radically different than 
the normal Yafutoman was not the same as attraction.

&quot;So, Vigoro,&quot; she interjected, hoping to get the topic back on the small 
meeting she&#39;d been having with him before, &quot;how is the search for Vyse 
going?&quot;

Vigoro shrugged noncommittally. &quot;He seems to have slipped out of our 
grasp again. But he won&#39;t be going anywhere far; we&#39;ve got his ship and 
most of his crew locked up tight here.&quot;

A sour look pierced Vigoro&#39;s usual good-natured and self-confident (if 
dull-witted) expression. &quot;Figures that of all of them he&#39;d take Red with 
him. Ah well, I&#39;m sure my continued absence will just make her heart 
grow fonder!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure it can&#39;t get any less so,&quot; Belleza replied agreeably, then 
continued smoothly, &quot;I assume you plan to bring the crew back to Valua 
as prisoners of war?&quot;

Vigoro shrugged disinterestedly, his attention having shifted to an 
attractive Yafutoman woman they were passing. &quot;That was the plan, but 
Kangan said he has jurisdiction. Wants to execute them later as trophies 
or something. It&#39;s not important to us, so I didn&#39;t really argue. Say, I 
think she&#39;s looking at me; what do you think, Belleza? I guess that raw 
charisma like mine carries over all cultural boundaries, eh?&quot;

Belleza was silent a moment as she considered Vigoro&#39;s speech (the 
former part, not the latter; she was pretty sure that the woman wasn&#39;t 
looking at either of them with any more curiosity than all the rest of 
the Yafutomans did). A minor change in her plans, it would seem.

They passed the woman by uneventfully, and Vigoro, undaunted, began to 
insist that she hadn&#39;t spoken simply out of awe of his magnificence.

&quot;I doubt it, Vigoro,&quot; Belleza replied with crystal clarity. &quot;It&#39;s just 
that you don&#39;t really know what women want.&quot;

Silence. Dead silence.

Then laughter. Big, raucous, full-blast laughter emptying Vigoro&#39;s 
impressive lungs of air as its fuel.

&quot;Belleza,&quot; Vigoro smirked after he was done, &quot;NO one knows women like 
Vigoro the Charming! What would YOU know about the subject, eh?&quot;

&quot;You mean besides being a woman myself?&quot; Belleza asked flatly. &quot;Well, 
I&#39;ve had my share as well, you know, and I&#39;m fairly certain I&#39;m more 
effective than you would be.&quot;

&quot;You have?&quot; came the surprised response. It seemed he was learning 
something unexpected about Belleza each hour since arriving here. 
Nonetheless, he wasn&#39;t about to let her get the better of him on a 
subject so important to him. &quot;No matter, I still know how to get the 
ladies better than anyone else! Why, the legacy of Vigoro the Manly 
is--&quot;

&quot;Care to take a wager on it?&quot;

Once more, her interruption stopped Vigoro dead in his speech. Only for 
a moment, though. &quot;Certainly! Name your terms, Belleza!&quot;

&quot;If you win,&quot; the woman general brusquely answered, &quot;I&#39;ll allow you the 
opportunity to personally defeat Vyse should he return here, as I am 
sure he will try. If I win, I get to. The winner is the one who proves 
that they know best what a woman wants. Deal?&quot;

Vigoro grinned at the chance to show his superior manliness to both 
Belleza and Vyse in the same blow. &quot;You betcha!&quot;

&quot;Uh, but,&quot; he then added, lowering his voice and looking about 
with--could it be?--a sheepish expression, &quot;This stuff doesn&#39;t 
really...MEAN anything, right? You know what I mean.&quot;

Belleza hid a small, genuinely gentle smile from her peer. She knew 
exactly what Vigoro meant, and that his thoughts were on the spunky 
red-head constantly with Vyse. It was the same way her thoughts briefly 
flashed to her superior officer. &quot;Of course. What is done here means 
nothing, and needs not be retold to anyone.&quot;

Vigoro&#39;s typical self-confident grin reappeared, and he enveloped 
Belleza&#39;s dainty hand in his own muscular one to seal the pact. And then 
immediately set off in search of womanly conquest.

Good, the purpose was set.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vyse&#39;s crew had fought valiantly for a group who were not warriors. It 
had taken a great many Valuan soldiers and Yafutoman royal guards to 
suppress them and capture the Delphinus, and a fair number would never 
serve their respective country again from it. While these deaths caused 
Belleza the same sorrow that all needless slaughter did, she at the same 
time knew it was a testament to how inspiring a leader Vyse was to 
inspire such loyalty in his crew that they would take on such impossible 
odds rather than surrender their leader&#39;s ship quietly. Even the man 
known as Lawrence, whom Belleza understood from intelligence reports was 
simply a hired mercenary, had fought without hesitation (and for that 
matter, had been one of the most skilled of the crew).

And even if their enthusiasm for defiance no longer filled their 
features as they sat crowded in a couple of Yafutoma&#39;s most unpleasantly 
damp and odorous prison cells, their determination was no less evident. 
Indeed, Belleza freely admitted that a crew such as this, held together 
by something stronger than just payment and military service, could 
probably accomplish things never imagined before if given the chance. 
Just like their captain.

Not that assessing Vyse&#39;s followers was her purpose for coming down 
here, of course. She was here to scrutinize and stare at the women of 
Vyse&#39;s crew with blatantly obvious lechery.

There were two in particular that struck her eye; the first was the 
older of two very similar Yafutoman women, with a strong, blunt face and 
toned body. Belleza could already tell she had a good, strong spirit, as 
indomitable as her muscular physique. But, unfortunately, that could 
translate into total refusal to cooperate, and also, this woman, being a 
Yafutoman, would have to be very new to the crew and not have the proper 
attachment to the others that Belleza could...utilize.

The second girl that caught Belleza&#39;s eye, though...she was a different 
matter. Very interesting, that Vyse would have Ixa&#39;takans in his 
comrades as well. They could have an unseen talent that Valua had never 
seen, for surely they held no engineering or ship-keeping talents, being 
as undeveloped as they were, yet Vyse would never, Belleza was sure, 
keep any around for forced manual labor. Nor would the Ixa&#39;takans be 
likely to volunteer such help, having been mistreated and abused for it 
for so long.

But enough with practicalities. Belleza had more pressing thoughts on 
her mind. She made a great show of slowly letting her eyes drift up and 
down the Ixa&#39;takan girl. Long, limber, and very visible limbs, with an 
uncommon mix of soft and gentle curves with ready, trained hidden 
sinew...delicate hands and dainty, yet clearly agile and well-used feet 
(not entirely surprising, considering Ixa&#39;takans&#39; typical refusal to 
wear shoes)...a thin, taut belly that boasted neither fullness nor 
hunger...an exotic, yet pretty face looking to be used to a certain mix 
of shyness and resilience...and finally, that long, light silver hair 
that Ixa&#39;takans sometimes had, so exotic and rare to most of the 
civilized skies.

Plus, she was wearing next to nothing, sporting nothing more than 
leaf-based garments holding her hair back, containing her smaller, yet 
alluring breasts, and covering her womanhood from a world that most 
certainly must have often shown interest in it. It was fairly obvious to 
anybody (which would be the point) that this woman was the most 
beautiful and attractively dressed. The decision was easy enough to 
make.

Belleza called over to one of the Valuan guards. When asked what she 
needed, she replied in a tone that left absolutely no doubt what her 
purpose was, &quot;I&#39;m taking that one to my quarters. I wish to...talk...to 
her.&quot;

The Valuan soldier stared for a moment, and Belleza had a feeling she 
knew what kind of expression he was hiding behind his pointed helmet. 
Then with a quick, &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; he and a couple of his fellow grunts 
opened the cage and unlocked the bonds on the Ixa&#39;takan woman, escorting 
her out. There was compliance in her walk, but defiance in her face. 
Yes, she&#39;d do very nicely, Belleza had little doubt.

Turning away, the general told her subordinates over her shoulder that 
that was all for now, and then ordered the Ixa&#39;takan woman to follow her 
to her quarters aboard her ship.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Belleza&#39;s quarters were not lavishly decorated, but at the same time 
were far more inviting and pleasant than what many high-ranking officers 
would consider appropriate. But that was okay. After living so many 
years of her life with nothing before earning her current high position 
in life, she felt she was fully entitled to enjoy some modest rewards 
for her accomplishments.

Of course, neither of the current occupants of the room seemed to be 
interested in this. Belleza, because she had become quite accustomed to 
her own living space&#39;s appearance, and the Ixa&#39;takan woman, because, 
well, she seemed hardly in a pleasant enough mood to care. She glared 
baleful defiance at Belleza from her seat across the Valuan&#39;s small 
table.

Well, no sense in prolonging this. &quot;So, prettiest of the outlaw crew, 
tell me: what is your name?&quot;

Anger flared in the foreigner&#39;s eyes, but she did answer. &quot;My name is 
Merida, Valuan.&quot;

&quot;And I am General Belleza,&quot; was her even response. She continued without 
pause, &quot;What does an Ixa&#39;takan with such rare beauty do for the renowned 
air pirate Vyse?&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Merida asked, voice filled with scorn. &quot;Are you hoping I am a 
warrior? An engineer? Someone of importance, whom you can squeeze every 
last drop of useful information from as you did the blood of my people?&quot; 
She forced a short, mocking laugh. &quot;Then your greed for my beauty 
betrays you. I am a dancer; I know nothing.&quot;

Well, well, well! Belleza was duly impressed. This Merida was no pretty 
pushover; she had quite a prideful fire within her. What made it all the 
more interesting was that from what Belleza could tell, she seemed like 
she would be (and probably was) much more accustomed to being cheerful 
and pleasant. Fascinating; this really would prove interesting.

Belleza smiled at her forced guest. &quot;No, I was simply curious to know a 
little about you, Merida. Interrogation isn&#39;t my area of expertise, 
anyways. A dancer, are you? I&#39;m also one, though now because it&#39;s a 
useful skill at times rather than by survival necessity.&quot;

Merida made no response to this, but just continued to glare at Belleza. 
The air general shrugged; she actually wouldn&#39;t have minded discussing 
the different dancing styles and techniques between Ixa&#39;taka and the 
more &quot;civilized&quot; of Arcadia&#39;s countries, but Merida clearly wasn&#39;t 
interested. Not altogether surprising, of course.

&quot;Well,&quot; Belleza began after a moment, &quot;I imagine you know why I brought 
you here, Merida?&quot;

The foreign dancer&#39;s eyes narrowed, and her lips pursed together in a 
set, determined line, parting only long enough for her to say, &quot;I can&#39;t 
stop you from forcing yourself on me, Valuan, but you can&#39;t force me to 
participate.&quot;

Belleza chuckled, pleased with this defiance. &quot;No, I certainly can&#39;t. I 
could only threaten you with all manner of unpleasant things, but in the 
end, I can&#39;t force you if you have the will to resist, which I suspect 
you do. Men certainly have the advantage in this sort of situation.&quot;

&quot;Then just send me back,&quot; Merida pleaded. For the first time, a tinge of 
fear and desperation was visible in her eyes. Despite her cool (if not 
calm) exterior, this woman truly did fear what could happen here. &quot;What 
can there be to gain from doing this?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d be surprised what we could gain,&quot; Belleza replied, not giving 
away her satisfaction that Merida, despite her quick and clever 
thinking, was nonetheless easy (and interesting) to manipulate. She saw 
ahead one step; Belleza saw ten because she made the path in the first 
place. Few people had the skill and dumb luck to disrupt the paths she 
set and even the field--not everyone could be Vyse. &quot;What would happen 
if I returned you now, Merida? You&#39;re strangely eager to be back in a 
cramped, ill-kept prison cell where you can await execution in a strange 
land by enemies you don&#39;t even know. Your one comfort might be that you 
have friends to be with before the end comes--but then, they&#39;re going to 
die as well, so I doubt that you would draw much consolation from that.&quot;

&quot;Better to be with them in our final night than in a Valuan&#39;s bed!&quot;

&quot;But,&quot; Belleza suggested slyly, &quot;perhaps it doesn&#39;t HAVE to be final 
night for you or your friends.&quot;

There was a very tense pause as her Merida pondered those words--and 
Belleza could tell from her expression that she already knew the answer 
to her next question: &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

The red-haired woman shrugged nonchalantly. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t be difficult 
for me to approach the new ruler of this country and demand that you and 
your friends be taken as Valuan hostages. You&#39;d be brought back to 
Valua, be put on trial where all charges against you would be dropped 
because of my official testimony that you were coerced against your will 
by Vyse into serving him, and either go free or serve a minute prison 
term--a year at most. All I would need to save the lives of you and your 
friends would be...a reason.

&quot;Or,&quot; Belleza reminded her, &quot;you can refuse my offer. I like your strong 
will and clever mind, Merida, so I&#39;ll probably spare you anyways. Kangan 
will just use the execution of your friends as some ridiculous show of 
might. It&#39;s up to you, Merida.&quot;

There was a moment&#39;s hesitation. Then Merida slowly spoke, looking down 
to avoid Belleza&#39;s eyes. &quot;If...if I do as you please now...you swear 
that you&#39;ll save my friends?&quot;

&quot;I do.&quot;

Belleza waited and watched as Merida, still looking down at the table, 
gritted her teeth in obvious frustration. It was but a moment, however, 
and with a deep intake of air to calm herself, she raised her head, 
looked Belleza in the eye, and asked with utter calm and compliance, 
&quot;What do you wish me to do, General Belleza?&quot;

&quot;Just Belleza will do, Beautiful,&quot; she answered, carefully hiding her 
satisfied smirk. &quot;Now, for starters, take off your clothes and lie down 
over on the bed.&quot;

Merida obeyed wordlessly, and Belleza turned around and began to strip 
herself down to her underwear. Once she was done, she turned and watched 
in as detached a manner as she could (Merida&#39;s toned, lean, lightly 
tanned body was difficult to keep her eyes off, particularly her small 
and (dare she think it?) cute posterior) as Merida strode to the bed and 
silently lay down on her back. She propped her head up on a comfortable 
pillow and stared boldly and without shame back at Belleza.

&quot;You&#39;re truly willing to do this,&quot; Belleza remarked as she gazed from 
her spot several feet away. &quot;Your loyalty to your friends is that 
strong. It&#39;s fascinating, how powerful a leader Handsome is to inspire 
such bonds in his crew.&quot;

&quot;Valuans would know nothing of it,&quot; Merida responded evenly, to which 
Belleza shrugged. People were people; there were men and women of great 
and poor character on both sides of any war.

Oh, well. Enough conversation. It was time to get to business! Belleza 
took a deep breath and, with great purpose, sat down in her seat and 
poured herself some Yafutoman tea. This tea she leisurely drank while 
reviewing some reports.

After a few minutes, she heard Merida speak up in a tone of confusion. 
&quot;Er...ah, Belleza?&quot;

&quot;Hm?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; There was a pause. Obviously Merida was trying to figure out what 
exactly she was trying to say. &quot;I&#39;m, uh...ready?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I saw, thank you. Keep it up; you&#39;re doing a great job.&quot;

Belleza didn&#39;t look up for any part of this small conversation, and sat 
for a few minutes more while enjoying the heavy atmosphere of confusion 
she was setting.

Several more minutes passed before Merida spoke up once more. &quot;You 
Valuans have a very strange way of doing this.&quot;

Suddenly, there was a knock at the door, and Belleza finally looked up. 
Excellent, time for the next part. She stood and quietly told Merida, 
&quot;Now, don&#39;t say anything, understand?&quot;

Merida looked at her and made it visually known that she thought Belleza 
was mad.

&quot;Now who could that be?&quot; Belleza said, raising her voice a little above 
her usual volume. &quot;Always right when things are really getting started, 
too!&quot;

Merida continued to obey the request for silence, but her face showed 
further certainty that Belleza was utterly insane.

No matter. Belleza made her way to the door, making sure to make a fair 
amount of noise in doing so, and opened the door about halfway--just 
enough for Merida to clearly see the visitor to be the villainous new 
emperor.

For his part, Kangan looked quite shocked. This, of course, was 
perfectly understandable, as he was staring at the foreign general 
Belleza in nothing but her undergarments with a completely naked woman 
waiting on her bed within. It was enough to fluster him into silence for 
a moment.

Belleza gave a very impatient frown. &quot;What is it, Kangan? I think you 
can tell I&#39;m a little busy.&quot;

The man managed to gather himself (and under the circumstances, it 
probably wasn&#39;t an easy accomplishment) and say, &quot;Er, you, uh, requested 
that I come to speak with you regarding details of our military pact...&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Belleza responded, smiling in slight embarrassment at what 
had apparently been her mistake. &quot;Of course. I&#39;m sorry, I forgot that 
I&#39;d called you here. We&#39;ll need to meet later on about that. I&#39;m 
terribly sorry.&quot;

&quot;Er, quite, ah, quite alright, general. I will be on my way now!&quot;

As Kangan hurried off, Belleza added, seemingly as an after-thought, 
&quot;Oh, and Kangan, due to certain circumstances, the Valuan Empire will be 
taking custody of Vyse&#39;s captured renegades. That&#39;s acceptable, I 
assume?&quot;

Kangan looked like he wished to argue the point, but wished even more 
just to be out of this situation. &quot;Yes, of course.&quot;

And that was that. Belleza closed the door, chuckling softly to herself, 
and walked over to where her clothes lay in a heap. As though just 
remembering, she looked over at Merida, who looked almost as confused as 
Kangan had at first, and told her, &quot;Thank you, Merida. You may get 
dressed now, if you wish. I&#39;ll just need you to stay here for a little 
while longer before I bring you back to your crewmates. Must keep up 
appearances, after all.&quot;

&quot;Appearances,&quot; Merida repeated, deep in thought for a moment. She made 
no move to get up and retrieve her skimpy garments.

&quot;Something wrong?&quot; Belleza asked, gathering her clothing from the floor 
and setting it on the table to put back on.

&quot;I&#39;m trying to understand what just happened,&quot; Merida answered. &quot;This 
was all a set-up of some sort so that you would gain custody over I and 
my friends?&quot; Belleza nodded, and Merida&#39;s next question was, &quot;Why?&quot;

Ah, yes, why. Of all questions, it was always why that was most 
complicated to answer, because it covered so many different queries. Why 
the deception? Why did she want the crew to begin with? Why Merida 
rather than anyone else? Still, Belleza felt that after putting Merida 
through this experience, she owed her a satisfactory explanation.

&quot;Well,&quot; she started, leaning against the table as she faced Merida, who 
had just now risen to sit on the side of the bed, &quot;I hate the thought of 
people dying. I know you probably can&#39;t understand, but it&#39;s the reason 
that I serve as a general. So when I was informed that Kangan planned to 
execute you and your friends, I had to find a way to keep that from 
happening. The only problem is, some of my peers, and certainly a 
devious man such as Kangan, would see such an act of mercy as weakness, 
and I simply can&#39;t afford to have my reputation as an effective and 
valued leader to be damaged like that. But while men like Kangan and my 
fellow general don&#39;t understand the values of mercy, they can recognize 
the universal idea of coercing someone into doing whatever they want 
with bribes, so if I make it appear that I&#39;m bribing you into being 
intimate with me, they&#39;ll be more likely to accept and respect that than 
my simply showing kindness.&quot;

What a strange world it was where begging favors to satisfy base, animal 
urges would be more respected as strength than empathy.

Merida was keeping up with all this, and now interjected with a 
question. &quot;But why not tell me this from the beginning? I would have 
gladly went along with it, had I known your intentions were so just.&quot;

Belleza gave a small shrug. &quot;I hope you&#39;ll forgive me for that, Merida. 
To be honest, I was simply curious...Vyse is such a fascinating young 
man with so many rare and exemplary qualities; I wanted to see just how 
loyal his crew could be to him and each other when you&#39;ve known him for 
so little time. To unite so many different people in a bond strong 
enough that you&#39;d do so much for one another...well, there are times I 
truly regret having him as a foe.&quot;

Both of them were silent for a moment, and Belleza went back to filling 
out her reports, deciding that it was actually more comfortable in the 
warm cabin to stay dressed as she was.

&quot;So, then it was all a lie for our benefit? Your actions and interest in 
me and all?&quot;

Without looking up, Belleza gave a light chuckle and answered. &quot;Well, 
not entirely. One secret I&#39;ve long since learned about deception is to 
always include some truth in it. It&#39;s much easier to tell a convincing 
half-truth than a full-blown lie. One of the reasons I chose you is 
because you&#39;re the most beautiful of your group; I don&#39;t have to show 
off an attraction I don&#39;t feel. A little truth can go a very long way 
when you know what you&#39;re doing.&quot;

Belleza heard no response from Merida, and went back to filling out her 
reports. A moment later, however, she suddenly felt a pair of slender, 
yet soft hands gently descend to her shoulders, then begin smoothly and 
firmly massaging them, focusing on the sensual apex where Belleza&#39;s 
shoulders ended and neck began. Its slow, steady, but demanding pace and 
strength left no question of the intentions behind it.

Belleza turned to look up at Merida, following her slim frame with her 
eyes until she reached the Ixa&#39;takan&#39;s collected, purposeful, and 
eagerly benevolent expression.

&quot;Why?&quot; she asked. There was no great surprise or sense of disbelief in 
her voice, just an accepting curiosity.

Merida shrugged as she continued her actions. &quot;I don&#39;t know. Gratitude 
for what you&#39;ve orchestrated for us, perhaps at cost to your name? A 
reward for a decency rare in Valuans? Maybe, or maybe I just want to. 
Does it matter?&quot;

&quot;It does,&quot; Belleza replied as she rose from her seat and turned to face 
Vyse&#39;s lovely crewmate, &quot;But so long as it&#39;s not for fear or 
misunderstanding, it&#39;s right.&quot;

Merida&#39;s hands had not left Belleza&#39;s neck, so she now used them to pull 
the fiery-haired general to her to kiss her hard on the lips. There 
wasn&#39;t a soft prelude, no tender foreplay involved--there wasn&#39;t time 
for it, and it had no place here anyway. They simply pressed their lips 
together, and a moment later, they found themselves pressing their 
tongues against one another. As they did this, they closed the space 
between their bodies, and began to press themselves against each other, 
as well. Belleza let her arms come together behind Merida, dropping down 
to let her hands rest on the woman&#39;s exceptionally tight and lovely 
butt, grasping it and using that hold to push the Ixa&#39;takan closer 
still. Each reveled at the heat and sensual energy that passed through 
them as they seemed to try to meld together. The mild, yet greatly 
arousing pleasure that came of this intense closeness, this near 
oneness, was not dampened to any real discernable degree by the presence 
of Belleza&#39;s underwear, but it was still something she realized would 
have to be taken out of the equation soon. First, though...

As was her nature, Belleza naturally took control of the situation to 
set a pace according to her own preference. She broke off the kiss and 
said through gasps for air she hadn&#39;t realized she needed, &quot;Sit down on 
the bed, Beautiful.&quot;

Merida nodded and did as she was told, planting herself down a few 
inches in from the side of Belleza&#39;s mattress, letting her legs dangle 
off it below the knees, not quite touching the floor. When Belleza 
dropped to her hands and knees and moved to be before the light-haired 
woman, she eagerly spread her legs as far as she could. Of course, being 
a dancer through and through, this meant that she could spread her legs 
so far that her heels could rest on the edge of practically the ends of 
the bed, with her leaning back on her arms to support herself 
comfortably. Such feats of flexibility were not unknown to Belleza, 
since she herself was trained and accomplished in many forms of dance, 
but this was her first time seeing someone do it for her rather than the 
reverse. She could now understand firsthand just why it seemed to appeal 
so much to her previous partners.

After getting a very erotic look at Merida&#39;s open invitation, Belleza 
leaned forward and planted the first tender kiss of this encounter upon 
Merida&#39;s clit. The darker-skinned woman shivered with this new pleasure, 
and Belleza went to work. She slowly but firmly pressed her tongue 
against Merida&#39;s outer lips, swirling around them in a play that brought 
out a small groan of pleasure from further up. With each moan she heard, 
Belleza became more daring, slipping her tongue further into Merida&#39;s 
core for a moment, then retreating back until the next whimper came. 
Soon, Merida began alternately panting and softly moaning constantly, 
so, using her fingers to further open the entrance, Belleza&#39;s tongue 
invaded and started to fully explore its new territory, licking and 
pressing all around within Merida. And as this were not enough--which, 
from Merida&#39;s now-loud and persistent moans and shakes of pleasure, was 
not true--every few moments Belleza would move her head very slightly 
forward, just enough to rub Merida&#39;s clitoris, each time causing the 
woman to jerk in response.

It was not long before this assault pushed Merida over the brink. She 
was not loud, nor did she thrash wildly, but the high-pitched squeak and 
intake of air as she shivered with tiny, beautifully pleasing muscle 
spasms told the tale just as well. Throughout it, Belleza continued to 
lick, swirling her tongue around now not so much as to bring pleasure, 
but to capture her temporary lover&#39;s passion&#39;s fluids.

Once she&#39;d had her fill, and Merida was done recovering from her orgasm, 
Belleza stood, intending to get fully undressed so they could continue 
and she could get a release, something that by this point she 
desperately wanted. She had but removed her bra, however, when Merida 
unexpectedly grabbed her around the waist and pulled her down onto the 
bed.

Not what she&#39;d planned, but as Merida lay down with her and captured her 
lips once more, Belleza was content to let another take charge for the 
moment. Thankfully, Merida seemed to know full well that Belleza was at 
this point uninterested in foreplay, and so, still kissing her fiercely, 
she moved one hand down and slipped her fingers into Belleza&#39;s 
underwear. Belleza moaned passionately into the kiss, rumbling sound 
traveling from her throat to Merida&#39;s.

Merida&#39;s fingers began to rub against her mound, eliciting another muted 
groan from the Valuan general, before two were slipped into her folds to 
poke and prod her within. Belleza&#39;s excitement could easily be felt as 
Merida&#39;s digits penetrated her well-lubricated center. It was the work 
of but moments, a few rhythmic thrusts and squirms with fingers, a few 
soft strokes of thumb against clit, for Merida to bring Belleza to 
climax. She broke the kiss as it crashed through her, her loud moans 
finally free to make themselves known to any who would listen. Merida 
took this opportunity to bring her mouth down to Belleza&#39;s breast and 
suck upon it, only increasing the pleasure of the orgasm.

Finally, it was over, and it only took Belleza a moment to readjust her 
eyes to see straight again. And what she saw was Merida grinning slyly 
next to her.

&quot;That was fast.&quot;

&quot;Hey, I waited all through you for it,&quot; Belleza protested playfully, not 
minding lowering her guard for a moment to be comfortable with her 
companion.

&quot;Hm, I bet I could make you come just as fast again,&quot; Merida replied, 
her grin not leaving.

Belleza glanced at her clock, knowing she would be due for a meeting 
with Vigoro and some lower officers soon. &quot;Well, Beautiful,&quot; she said, 
smiling slightly, &quot;I think you&#39;ve got enough time to try.&quot;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the end, Vyse came and rescued his crew long before any execution 
could have taken place anyway. And Vigoro still claimed a victory on the 
little contest between him and Belleza, for while he admitted that 
Belleza&#39;s &quot;catch&quot; was quite something, he still believed that obtaining 
3 Yafutoman women for a reasonable cost proved him the winner. Belleza 
gave him the victory--he had, after all, proven that he, too knew what 
some women wanted.

Nonetheless, for a brief moment in time, two people who should have been 
mortal enemies were able to share understanding, and help one another in 
many ways. And to Belleza&#39;s eyes, such an achievement of personal peace 
in an international conflict would never be a waste of time.</pre>
