<h1>Itara Hanasanai no ni (part 1 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../angeldust/index.html">Angel/Dust</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shidare.html">Shidarezakura</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Disclaimer: This is a parallel world from that of the original story. Yuina and Akiho are
still friends but they never met Seraph and Lucifer. This does have yuri type stuff in it... so
don&#39;t sue me, this is just a fanfic. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Yuina sat with Akiho onto of the roof of her house, looking at the stars. Wind blew 
across their faces and Akiho smiled, her long hair twisting. She turned to Yuina. 
 &quot;Yui-chan... what do you think about when you sing?&quot; she asked. Yuina blinked. 
 &quot;When I&#39;m singing? Well, I think of  all the happiness my voice can carry to people... Life 
can be so cruel, so I want to help things be happy,&quot; Yuina says, still staring at the sky. 
 &quot;That&#39;s very kind of you... I&#39;d never be able to even be worthy of something like that...&quot; 
Akiho slumps down. 
 &quot;Worthy? What do you mean?&quot; 
 &quot;You&#39;ve always been better then me... always. I envy you...&quot; 
 &quot;Aki-chan... don&#39;t envy me... I mean look at you. You have the softest hair... and you 
have soft skin. We all have something to envy... But, we were created imperfect... so don&#39;t
be depressed,&quot; Yuina smiles. 
 Akiho smiles and nods back. &quot;Yeah... I guess you&#39;re right...&quot; 
 &quot;Hehehe... I&#39;m always right! Mwahahahaha!!!&quot; Yuina jumps up and smiles. 
 &quot;EH?!!&quot; Akiho jumps up and grabs Yuina&#39;s wrist and pulls her. &quot;Always right!?!&quot; 
 &quot;Yes!!! I am the master!!!&quot; Yuina laughs and grabs Akiho&#39;s arm. 
 &quot;Master?&quot; 
 &quot;Yup!!&quot; 
 Akiho smiles and hugs Yuina. Yuina blinks and begins to blush. Akiho cuddles close. 
 &quot;Mmmm... would you be my master?&quot; 
 &quot;Eh... me???&quot; Yuina jumps, surprised. 
 &quot;Hehehe! Yes you!&quot; Akiho lets go of Yuina and runs over to the window. &quot;You&#39;re my 
master!&quot; Akiho jumps inside and jumps off the bed. 
 &quot;Akiho&#39;s master...?&quot; 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Drifting in space&#39;s time, a body moved slowly. It&#39;s wings ripped and it&#39;s body beaten. The 
voice of a hole shattered the silence. Drawing the body toward it. 
 The corpse seemed to still be alive. It had a feminine shape to it, long hair... beautiful.
Descending into the hole and disappearing. The circular vacuum collapsing and drifting 
away. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Chirping birds fluttered over and past Yuina and Akiho&#39;s heads. They wore their school 
uniforms and were talking about an anime. 
 &quot;That one part where she gets hit and flies over and 
hit by that car and falls into the river and gets almost eaten by a fish! Hahaha! Imagine that 
in the real world!&quot; Akiho laughs. 
 &quot;I know! Hahahaha! And where the hooligan came in and stuff! I love it!!&quot; Yuina says and 
pushes her glasses up. 
 Akiho smiles and watches each expression Yuina makes. Her heart racing as Yuina smiles. 
Akiho was in love with Yuina, but she couldn&#39;t tell her. The thought of rejection would 
cause massive heart break and tears, and that&#39;s something Akiho feared. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 From above the earth, a large gap ripped through space. A illuminating light bursts through, 
moving toward earth. White streaks flowing from the back of the ball of white fire. It hits 
the atmosphere, ripping into it and twirling down. Falling past clouds and air. 
 Akiho and Yuina 
were walking near the forest, taking the long way home to keep talking about what 
happened in school. The thing from space could be seen in the distance. Yuina looks up. 
 &quot;Whoa... what is that??&quot; Yuina watches it grow bigger in distance. 
 &quot;It could me some sort of meteor!&quot; Akiho gasps. 
 The white ball twists and crashes down in the middle of the forest, burning acres of 
land and knocking down trees. Birds fly for safety and a large beam shoots straight into the 
sky, then evaporates. Everything grows quiet. 
 &quot;Let&#39;s go see what happened!&quot; Akiho grabs Yuina&#39;s arm. 
 &quot;Ah! But what if there&#39;s strange monsters or radiation?!&quot; 
 &quot;Let&#39;s take the risk... hehehe!&quot; 
 The girls run into the forest. Pushing branches and jumping over roots. It didn&#39;t take them 
long until the found the area the &quot;meteor&quot; hit. Akiho and Yuina looked all around. Trees 
where on fire and there was a warm mist coming from where the meteor should be. Slowly, 
they walk toward the large crater and peered down. 
 &quot;I don&#39;t see anything...&quot; Yuina looks and waves her hand around moving the smoke. 
 &quot;Wait... what&#39;s that!&quot; Akiho points down near the bottom of the crater. &quot;It&#39;s a person!&quot; 
 They start to climb down the warm ground. Yuina was starting to freak out, thinking the 
person is probably dead. Akiho didn&#39;t know what to think. 
 The girls finally reach the bottom and run over to the body. Yuina kneeled down and 
checked it&#39;s pulse. Her eyes widen. 
 &quot;The lady is still alive! But her pulse is weak,&quot; Yuina told Akiho. 
 &quot;What about CPR?&quot; Akiho asked getting worried. 
 &quot;Yeah!&quot; Yuina looks at the body, she tilt the head back a bit to open the air passage. She 
holds the nose closed and moves the chin down and takes a breath, then places her mouth 
over the woman&#39;s mouth and blows air into her lungs. Yuina looks over at the woman&#39;s 
chest and sees it rise. 
 &quot;You can do it Yui-chan!&quot; 
 Yuina repeats everything, hoping the woman would wake up. If Yuina becomes tired, Akiho 
had to take over. Suddenly, as Yuina goes to blow more air in, the woman&#39;s arms lift up and 
wrap around Yuina. 
 &quot;MMMM!!!!&quot; Yuina tries screaming and jumps up, breaking what seemed to be a kiss. 
 &quot;Ah! Yuina! Are you okay?!&quot; 
 Yuina didn&#39;t say anything as the woman sat up and opened her eyes. She looked deeply 
into Yuina&#39;s and Akiho saw it. The woman slowly stood and looked at them both. 
 &quot;Where... where am I?&quot; she asked them. 
 &quot;Ah... you were unconscious... w-we had seen a meteor hit here... are you hurt?!&quot; Yuina 
asked frantically. 
 &quot;I&#39;m fine... what are your names...?&quot; 
 &quot;I&#39;m Hatori Yuina... and this is Kudou Akiho...&quot; 
 &quot;Hmmm...&quot; the woman looked around. &quot;I&#39;ve come far... my home planet was destroyed and I 
barely got away. This world seems so much like mine...&quot; 
 &quot;You came from space?!&quot; Akiho blinks. 
 &quot;Deep in space time... I must have been sucked by the dark portals and brought here.&quot; 
 Suddenly they hear sirens of ambulances and fire trucks in the distance. Yuina and Akiho 
looked at each other, unsure if they should let anybody else see this woman. 
 &quot;They will probably get her! We have to get out of here!!&quot; Akiho tells Yuina. 
 Yuina nods and starts climbing up and out of the crater. 
 &quot;You have to follow us, please...&quot; Akiho said to the woman. The woman nods and floats 
out of the crater and waits for the two girls to get out. 
 Once they are out, they run into the foliage and trees and pass through brush. They finally 
are out of the forest and onto the main path. The woman floats over them and they turn the 
corner toward Yuina&#39;s house. 
 The run into the house and shut the door. Yuina and Akiho remove their shoes and breath 
hard. The woman watches them and smiles a bit. 
 &quot;Ahhh... Yuina... you okay?&quot; Akiho asks. 
 Yuina plops down on the couch. &quot;Yeah...&quot; She turns to the woman and smiles a bit and 
takes her glasses off. 
 &quot;I haven&#39;t formally introduced myself... I have no name... but in the Hierarchy-System, I am a 
Seraph. Please call me by that name,&quot; Seraph said. 
 &quot;Seraph?&quot; Yuina smiles. &quot;That&#39;s a nice name...&quot; 
 Akiho stares at Yuina and Seraph smiling at each other. Feeling the pain in her heart, that 
empty feeling... like she doesn&#39;t exist. She glares and stays silent...
