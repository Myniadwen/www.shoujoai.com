<h1>Itara Hanasanai no ni (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../angeldust/index.html">Angel/Dust</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shidare.html">Shidarezakura</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../angeldust/itara-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre> Yuina, Akiho, and Seraph had gone to Yuina&#39;s bedroom. They had to find out why Seraph 
was here and how would they hide her. Seraph looked around Yuina&#39;s room, noticing every 
detail. Books lined up, plushies, neat bed... it was so weird. As Seraph turned, Yuina 
noticed that one of her wings was torn up. 
 &quot;Ah! You&#39;re hurt!&quot; Yuina starts to frantically think of what to do. Seraph looks at her wing. 
 &quot;Hm? Oh, don&#39;t worry. It will fix itself...&quot; light flashed around the wound. Small balls float 
to it and the wing begins to heal. 
 &quot;Wow!!!&quot; Yuina&#39;s eyes become large. 
 Akiho watches them still. Reading each expression they make and hearing their echoing 
voices in her mind. Replaying over and over. She didn&#39;t understand what she was feeling, but 
she knew she felt hurt. As if somebody plugged up her lungs, everything is tight. What is 
Seraph? Why is she here...? She&#39;s making this whole thing difficult. And she has Yuina&#39;s 
attention... I don&#39;t exist... 
 &quot;Yuina-chan... I&#39;m gonna go home... I&#39;m not feeling so well...&quot; Akiho says to Yuina. &quot;I&#39;ll call 
you when I feel better...&quot; 
 &quot;Eh? Aki-chan!&quot; Yuina starts walking behind Akiho as she begins to leave the house. &quot;Are 
you okay?&quot; 
 &quot;Yeah... I&#39;m just a little sick to the stomach...&quot; Akiho slips her feet into her shoes and opens 
the door. &quot;Bye...&quot; She leaves. 
 &quot;...Akiho...&quot; Yuina stares at the door, hoping Akiho would come back in. 
 Seraph floats behind Yuina and wraps her arms around her waist. Yuina jumps a bit, not 
knowing she was there. 
 &quot;Seraph...?&quot; 
 Seraph smiles and kisses Yuina&#39;s neck. Yuina begins to blush. What&#39;s Seraph doing? 
Seraph smirks and whispers in Yuina&#39;s ear. 
 &quot;Yuina... I can hear every thought in your mind...&quot; 
 &quot;What?! But how?!&quot; 
 &quot;I forced you onto a contract... and when I kissed you... I became one with you...&quot; 
 &quot;What?!&quot; 
 &quot;We are unified... bonded together... I am you and you are me...&quot; 
 &quot;Seraph! What&#39;s going on!!!&quot; Yuina pushed out of Seraph&#39;s arms and turned, facing her.  
&quot;Why are you doing this! What are your plans?!&quot; 
 &quot;Plans?&quot; Seraph smiles, &quot;I have no definite plans... But I&#39;m afraid I am on a mission. My 
world was destroyed by a powerful emulator, like myself. Somehow in the war against it 
all, I came in contact with her and battled. But I was out numbered. They left me for dead 
and I drifted in space until I was brought here. It&#39;s destiny... all of it. The emulator has to be 
here.&quot; 
 &quot;Destiny...&quot; Yuina looks down. &quot;But... why the contract with me?&quot; 
 &quot;Because, when I awoke to your warm lips... I could feel your soul crying out. You want to 
be free, Yuina.&quot; 
 &quot;...&quot; 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Akiho walked slowly down the street. Staring at the ground, thinking of what had 
happened. The wind had stopped blowing and the sun was beginning to hide behind the 
large buildings. She didn&#39;t think of time or what was going on around her. 
 Yuina doesn&#39;t notice me now that Seraph has entered her life. I was just there to keep her 
company when she was bored with other things. Now she&#39;s bored with me. Brushed me off 
like I never existed. How could she do that? I&#39;ve known her for so long and suddenly 
Seraph comes in and screws everything up! Damn you Yuina... You&#39;re a traitor! How can 
you just throw me away like that!!! 
 Akiho turns the corner. She held her breath, hoping nobody would see her cry. Angry and 
upset at how Yuina treated her. It was wrong. 
 &quot;I hate you Yuina...&quot; she says and keeps walking, the stars in the sky move. 
 Akiho walks toward a dark alley. Her mind clouded and unaware of the environment 
around her. Tokyo at night was dangerous. She heard some footsteps and looked up. 
 &quot;Hey bitch!!! Come here!!&quot; a dark-skinned man, weighing about 270 pounds, wearing 
jeans and a black shirt, dark hair and sunglasses, appears from the alley and reaches out at 
Akiho. 
 &quot;Ahhhhhh!!!!!&quot; Akiho begins to turn. 
 &quot;Yaa!!&quot; the man dashes forward and grabs her arm and jerks her back. 
 &quot;Ahhhh!! Let me go!!! Help!!!!!!&quot; she screamed and tried kicking him and hitting him. 
 &quot;Shut da&#39; hell up!!&quot; he throws her into the wall and she falls over. He walks over to her 
and grabs her by the hair. She tries to gather her balance but he covers her mouth with his 
hand and picks her up. 
 &quot;Mmmm!!!! Mmmph!!!&quot; she tried screaming. 
 The man pulls her into the alley, way into the back. Small puddles on the ground from 
pipes draining. Trash and paper everywhere. He walks behind a staircase and throws her 
down. A flash of lightning lights up the sky. 
 &quot;Mmmm... I love young girls...&quot; he said and grabbed her arms. 
 &quot;AHHHH!!!! NO! PLEASE!!!&quot; Akiho screams as thunder rattles. Her voice seeming silent 
to the weather. 
 The man grabs the top of Akiho&#39;s uniform and rips it downward, revealing her bra. She 
screams more and rain begins to pour down. The drops hitting them hard. 
 &quot;LEAVE ME ALONE!!! HELP!!!! SOMEBODY!!!&quot; Akiho screams, tears beginning to 
fall down her soft cheeks. 
 &quot;Shut up!!!&quot; he backhands her in the jaw. She accidentally bites the inside of her cheek 
and blood trickles down the side of her mouth. &quot;If you make any more noise! I&#39;ll fuckin&#39; 
kill you!!! Do you got that?!?!?!&quot; 
 Akiho nods and cries silently. Was she afraid to die? No, she wanted to live. Live with 
Yuina and the world. 
 &quot;Good... hehehehe...&quot; the man rips her bra off and grabs her breasts and squeezes them. 
&quot;Mmmm... oh yes...&quot; 
 The world seem to be taking forever. Why wouldn&#39;t it end. Akiho didn&#39;t even want to 
look at the man. She was scared and helpless. The thunder roared on as the rain hit against 
their bodies. A heart beats... 
 &quot;Aki-chaaaaaan! Let&#39;s play!&quot; a girl says. 
 &quot;But... it&#39;s raining...&quot; Akiho says back. Her hair in pigtails. 
 &quot;That&#39;s okay! We can hide under our umbrellas and jump in the puddles!&quot; Echoing inside 
the soul... 
 &quot;Aki-chan! Come on! Let&#39;s sing!&quot; 
 &quot;I can&#39;t...&quot; 
 &quot;Don&#39;t say you can&#39;t! Try it!!&quot; Trapped by false emotions... 
 &quot;YUINAAAAAAA!!!!!!! HELP ME!!!!!!!&quot;
