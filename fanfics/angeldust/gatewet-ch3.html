<h1>Gatecrasher Wet (part 3 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../angeldust/index.html">Angel/Dust</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/zeba.html">Zeb A.</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../angeldust/gatewet-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;Seraph no! You can&#39;t come to school with me!&quot; Yuina protested for the 
fourth time, stopping and glaring at the woman. Cocking her head to 
the side slightly Seraph said &quot;But we made a contract. Now I have to 
be with you all the time.&quot; Yuina groaned, &quot;How am I going to explain 
your presence to my teachers?&quot; &quot;What about your friends?&quot; Seraph 
asked, and Yuina winced. &quot;I have none.&quot; Looking at her Seraph smiled 
and said &quot;Alright. Just remember, if you need me, you must invoke my 
key.&quot; Nodding, Yuina quoted it, having learned it by heart thanks to 
Seraph constantly mentioning it. &quot;There, see? I know it. Now go away!&quot; 
Blowing Yuina a kiss and winking, Seraph vanished into thin air.

Gaping, Yuina made a mental note to tell Seraph that she couldn&#39;t just 
vanish like that, especially in public! Smiling at a shocked bystander 
who had witnessed the scene she said, &quot;Oh she does that all the time! 
She&#39;s a magician ehe!&quot; before beating a hasty retreat.

Taking a huge breath of relief, Yuina made her way to her homeroom. 
Seraph really had stuck to her side after that kiss, so much so that 
she had woken up this morning to find Seraph sleeping beside her. 
That, and the fact that Seraph was virtually naked had caused Yuina to 
almost have a seizure. Blushing at the memory, Yuina found her seat at 
the far corner of the class and sat down.

Seraph had hit sore point earlier about her lack of friends. After 
losing her best friend in middle school, Yuina had stayed away from 
her classmates. Kept to herself and never participated in any of the 
school activities. She had never minded the lack of friends; but now 
with Seraph in her life, everything seemed so much more different. 
Suddenly, life seemed worth living again.

There was a stir, and looking up Yuina saw a beautiful woman enter the 
class. &quot;Hello. My name is Sahaku, I am to be your new homeroom teacher 
until Ms Yamazaki, your old homeroom teacher is discharged from 
hospital,&quot; the woman introduced herself. The class greeted her, and 
smiling she opened the door and ushered a girl in. &quot;Let me introduce 
you to a transfer student. This is Kudou Akiho.&quot;

Staring at the new girl, something clicked and with a gasp Yuina cried 
&quot;Aki-chan?&quot; Akiho glanced towards the girl sitting in the far corner, 
and felt her world tilt. &quot;Yuina!&quot; Glancing between the two girls 
Sahaku softly asked, &quot;You know each other?&quot; &quot;Yes! This is Yui-chan. We 
were best friends at middle school. May I sit next to her teacher?&quot; 
Akiho asked, looking at Sahaku, her eyes pleading. Nodding her ascent, 
Sahaku watched as Akiho tripped over to the corner and sat at an empty 
desk, the two girls soon talking to each other. Eyes narrowed, Sahaku 
called the class to order and began the lessons.

At lunch break Akiho and Yuina found a quiet spot for themselves in 
the school gardens.

&quot;Oh Yuina I never imagined I would ever get to see you again!&quot; Akiho 
smiled happily, drinking in the girl&#39;s features. Yuina had grown so 
beautiful. Her long pale blond hair reached just past her knees, her 
pale face dominated by her huge violet eyes. As she spoke, Akiho was 
again entranced by the soft sweet quality of her voice. &quot;Do you still 
sing Yuina?&quot;

She watched as a slow blush spread across Yuina&#39;s cheeks. &quot;Not since 
recently Akiho, but&#133; but I was never as good as you.&quot; Akiho smiled to 
herself; Yuina was still the same as ever; willing to let Akiho take 
credit for things she didn&#39;t deserve. &quot;No I&#39;m not Yuina. You should 
have gotten the lead role in the choir.&quot;

Yuina&#39;s head shot up, surprised at what Akiho had just said. &quot;It&#39;s 
true Yuina. I envied you so much; you were so much better than me. I 
couldn&#39;t handle your getting the role so I spoke to the teachers and 
they gave it to me because of who my father is,&quot; Akiho sighed, looking 
away. &quot;I felt so awful once I realized how cruel and wrong I had been. 
I&#133; I&#39;ve been wanting to say sorry for so long.&quot;

Smiling, Yuina sat next to Akiho and wrapped her arms around her 
friend and hugged her. &quot;Oh Akiho it doesn&#39;t matter anymore. I just 
hope we can be good friends again, like before. I&#39;ve missed you!&quot; 
Surprised and pleased at the same time, Akiho returned the hug and 
smiled. &quot;I&#39;ve missed you too Yuina.&quot;

From the shadows of nearby a tree, Lucifer watched, her hand clenched 
to the trunk of the tree, slowly shredding it. Jealousy flooded 
through her; no one could share Akiho&#39;s affection with her. They were 
hers and hers alone. Yuina Hatori would bear close watching.
