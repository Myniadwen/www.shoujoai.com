<a href="../angeldust/gatewet-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;Miss Akiho? It&#39;s time to wake up Miss Akiho,&quot; a voice called, and 
groaning Akiho Kudou rolled over and opened her eyes. She saw her maid 
Okudzume staring anxiously down at her. Groaning again Akiho said, 
&quot;I&#39;m going to sleep some more, go away!&quot; There was a silence. &quot;But 
Miss Akiho, your father wants to see you at breakfast.&quot;

Akiho sat up and cursed. &quot;And I shouldn&#39;t keep dear daddy waiting 
should I?&quot; Swinging her legs off the bed, Akiho stretched and stared 
out the huge French windows that lined one wall of her spacious 
bedroom. &quot;Now Miss Akiho, you shouldn&#39;t speak of your father like 
that,&quot; Okudzume admonished, laying out her mistress&#39; new school 
uniform. &quot;I can talk about my father any way I please. It&#39;s at least 
one grace I can allow myself!&quot; Akiho said, bitterly hating how much of 
her life was dictated by her father.

All her life Akiho had done what her father had told her to do. Never 
wanting to dis-please him in any way. Never wanting to lose his good 
opinion of her. Always wanting to be the best for him. She had even 
given up her best friend for him.

Akiho could remember the event well enough. It was when she was in 
middle school. Her father had learned of the trials for the lead role 
in the choir and wanted her to get it. He had know that her best 
friend would be trying out for the position and her told her on the 
day of the trial &quot;Don&#39;t let Hatori&#39;s daughter win Akiho. You are a 
Kudou so don&#39;t let me down!&quot;

When her best friend had been chosen for the lead role Akiho had been 
consumed with envy. She had complained, saying that she, a Kudou was 
better! Knowing that the school would not go against someone as 
powerful as her father, she had been given the lead role.

It had been an empty victory.

&quot;Oh Yuina, I wonder whether you can ever forgive me?&quot; Akiho whispered, 
remembering how at the time she had lorded her victory over her best 
friend; while deep inside hating Yuina. She had known very well that 
Yuina was far better in singing than she could ever be.

From that point on they had grown apart, and soon after Akiho had been 
transferred to a private boarding school for the rich. Making her way 
to the bathroom ensuite, Akiho wondered whether she would ever be 
given the chance to make up for her mistake.

An hour later, Akiho bowed to her father as she entered the breakfast 
room. Sitting at the shokutaku, her knees bent beneath her, Akiho let 
a servant serve her with an assortment of raw quail eggs, grilled 
fish, miso soup and rice.

&quot;Good morning Akiho, I trust you slept well?&quot; her father asked. &quot;Hai 
otousan,&quot; she murmured, taking up her chopsticks and delicately 
picking up a piece of fish and placing it in her mouth. It tasted 
delicious, but to Akiho it was another reminder of how her father&#39;s 
riches could control all aspects of her life.

&quot;I&#39;m glad. Today is your first day at this new high school and I hope 
it goes well for you.&quot; Rustling the papers he was reading, he put them 
down and looked at his daughter. She was a petite creature, resembling 
her dead mother in appearance. A good child most times, he was 
slightly disappointed that she had not been born a male. Unfortunately 
her mother had died giving birth to her, and being too busy to bother 
with finding another wife, he had given her care over to nannies and 
governesses.

If she continued to be a dutiful daughter, he would make sure she 
married well. Daughters were good for sealing deals through marriage, 
if anything.

Gently patting his mouth with a napkin, he said, &quot;I have a gift for 
you Akiho.&quot; The door opened and a woman walked in. Looking at her, 
Akiho felt very self-conscious, the woman was extremely beautiful. 
Long straight black hair reaching just past her knees and a svelte, 
neatly rounded figure dressed in a fashionable suit. She walked to her 
father&#39;s side and bowed, before turning and bowing to Akiho. &quot;This, is 
Sahaku. I&#39;ve arranged that she becomes your new homeroom teacher at 
the school. Her ultimate task is to make your life easier. Please 
listen to whatever she says.&quot;

You really mean her job is to watch over me and make sure I don&#39;t do 
anything that would harm the Kudou name Akiho thought, inwardly 
shaking with fury.

Her father then stood. Akiho immediately stood up and bowed. Pleased, 
he said &quot;This is your first day at school. Do well and don&#39;t 
disappoint me.&quot;

Half an hour later, her father&#39;s limo rolled to a stopped in front of 
her new school. Waiting for the chauffer to open the door, Akiho 
stared at the sprawling building and the groups of students making 
their way to classes. This was the first time since middle school that 
she had been to a public school. Although she wasn&#39;t exactly a snob, 
she felt she had nothing in common with them. Being brought up in the 
lap of luxury, she had developed an appreciation for the finer things 
in life. Even that didn&#39;t stop her from wishing she had more friends, 
but most were intimidated by her father&#39;s wealth and standing.

That was one of the many reasons why she loved having Yuina as a best 
friend. Yuina had looked past the wealth and fame and seen her for who 
she was; smiling to herself she realized that Yuina probably never saw 
the wealth at all. Yuina had been a good friend, and she Akiho, had 
gone and ruined it all.

&quot;Life is a constant battle Miss Akiho, those who are ruthless 
succeed,&quot; murmured Sahaku, and with a start Akiho stared at the woman 
sitting next to her in dismay. Sahaku smiled and answered her 
un-spoken question &quot;Yes, I read minds. More specifically, your mind.&quot;

&quot;What? Why&#133; how?&quot; Akiho asked, confused. &quot;We are connected Akiho. 
Connected in a way that can only make the both of us stronger,&quot; Sahaku 
replied, sliding closer to her, her skirt riding up her thighs. 
Reaching out with a slender hand, Sahaku stroked Akiho&#39;s smooth cheek, 
black lacquered nails gently scratching at each stroke. Held immobile 
by the rhythmic strokes and the mesmerizing glitter in Sahaku&#39;s eyes, 
Akiho could only watch.

She didn&#39;t feel afraid. She felt almost resigned to what was to come. 
Sahaku, for all her subservient exterior, was turning out to be as 
controlling as her father. By the looks of it, she had her father 
wrapped around her fingers and no amount of complaint from Akiho would 
sway her father from his faith in the woman. This realization was 
enough to make Akiho silently scream inside.

&quot;Yes connected Akiho. Together we will fulfill both our dreams,&quot; 
Sahaku whispered. Capturing Akiho&#39;s face in her hands she knelt 
forward and nipped Akiho&#39;s ear, before trailing soft kisses across her 
cheek, and then onto her mouth. The kiss was a shock to the senses. 
Akiho could feel Sahaku inside of her, inside her mind, learning 
everything there was to her. The invasion was less disturbing in 
comparison to the surge of desire that coursed through her at Sahaku&#39;s 
kiss!

She could hear Sahaku&#39;s laughter inside her head&#133; no, not Sahaku. This 
creature&#39;s name was Lucifer, a being from another world. Come to earth 
on a mission, a mission that she was irrevocably involved in now no 
matter what. &quot;Submit to me Akiho! Become mine and I will give you 
everything you could want!&quot; The pressure, the desire to please, the 
pleasure of the kiss; it all became too much for Akiho. With a groan, 
she gave way.
