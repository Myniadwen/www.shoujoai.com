<h2>a <a href="../angeldust/index.html">Angel/Dust</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shidare.html">Shidarezakura</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../angeldust/itara-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre> &quot;You don&#39;t know what you have done...&quot; 
 &quot;It&#39;s all your fault...&quot; 
 &quot;You can&#39;t run away...&quot; 
 &quot;Time will catch you...&quot; 
 &quot;Your blood will be poured out of this land...&quot; 
 &quot;I will see to it...&quot; 
 &quot;You will die by my hand...&quot; 
 Akiho opens her eyes and sits up. Her hair falls over her shoulders and she looks around. 
She was at her home, in her bed. Akiho gripped her bed sheets and looked down. A figure 
walks out from the shadows and Akiho looks up startled. 
 &quot;Hello Akiho... I&#39;m glad to see that you&#39;re alright...&quot; Lucifer smiled. 
 &quot;Wh-what? It... it wasn&#39;t a dream?!&quot; 
 &quot;I&#39;m afraid not... everything you have just gone through was real.&quot; 
 Akiho stares at Lucifer a bit and then looks down. Lucifer smiles and walks over to the 
window and unfolds the blinds and looks out the window. Looking up, Akiho watches 
Lucifer as she walks over toward her and bends over. 
 &quot;Akiho... you need to wake up!&quot; 
 &quot;Hm?&quot; 
 &quot;Heh...&quot; 
 Lucifer snaps her fingers and the sheet pulls away from Akiho. Akiho jumps a bit, and her 
pajama pants begin to pull off. 
 &quot;Ah!!!&quot; 
 Lucifer smirks and the pants come off and fall over to the side. Akiho blinks as her pajama 
shirt opens up and exposes her breasts. She quickly covers them. 
 &quot;What are you doing?!&quot; Akiho screams, her face turning red. 
 Lucifer laughs and walks over to Akiho and grabs her shoulders and pushes her onto her 
back. Lucifer&#39;s right hand holds onto Akiho&#39;s left breast. 
 &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be ashamed of your body...&quot; Lucifer squeezes her breast a bit. 
 &quot;Ah!!! What!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?!?!&quot; Akiho tries to push Lucifer off of her. 
 &quot;Hehehe!!!&quot; Lucifer takes Akiho&#39;s struggling as playful pushing and bends over and begins 
to kiss Akiho&#39;s neck. 
 &quot;AHHH!!! STOP!!! STOP STOP STOP!!!!&quot; Akiho keeps screaming.  Suddenly, the blinds 
shut and the room becomes dark. Akiho sees darkness in front of her. She notices that 
Lucifer isn&#39;t holding her. Standing slowly, she reaches out to see if anything is even there. 
Her clothes are totally gone and her bare body stands alone. 
 &quot;Lucifer...?&quot; Akiho whispers. 
 Akiho takes a step forward and suddenly falls forward, unable to stand. Her eyes widen as 
she keeps falling toward total darkness. Akiho&#39;s hair blowing and body feeling the pressure 
of the fall that seems to never end. 
 &quot;IYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!&quot; Akiho screams and smashes into the darkness which 
shatters into glass shards. 
 The world around her turns space, stars and planets surrounding her. Still she fell in this 
endless loop. 
 &quot;SOMEBODY HELP ME!!!!! AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!&quot; 
 Black strands shoot out from cracks in space and grab Akiho&#39;s arms and legs. They wrap 
around her body, between her legs, around them, around her breasts, arms, everything. She 
had stopped. Slowly, she opened her eyes. 
 &quot;Eh?!?!&quot; Akiho had opened her eyes and sees an angelic figure. 
 Wings spread out around space, the figure&#39;s hair, flowing as if a gust of wind was blowing. 
Akiho realizes that the black strands holding her are the figure&#39;s hair. 
 &quot;Who?!&quot; Akiho&#39;s voice echoed. 
 The figure&#39;s wings move slowly and it&#39;s arms open. A small light appears where it&#39;s chest is. 
 &quot;?!&quot; 
 &quot;Akiho...&quot; 
 &quot;Eh? Lucifer?!&quot; 
 &quot;Akiho, I am inside of you... in your subconscious mind...&quot; 
 &quot;What&#39;s going on?!&quot; 
 &quot;In order for you to understand where I came from... I must show you...&quot; 
 &quot;I don&#39;t understand! Are we in space?! I thought... but... I...&quot; 
 &quot;Shhhh... Akiho, relax. You are in your own mind. Right now you are in the part that 
holds the secrets to your past and things humans have, that... they don&#39;t know about...&quot; 
 &quot;I still don&#39;t understand...&quot; 
 &quot;Look in front of you Akiho... what do you see?&quot; 
 &quot;I...&quot; Akiho looks up and stares at the figure. The light shines on it&#39;s face and it slowly 
looks up at Akiho. It&#39;s eyes open and Akiho gasps. In front of her, she sees herself. 
 &quot;Akiho... this is you... your true form...&quot;
