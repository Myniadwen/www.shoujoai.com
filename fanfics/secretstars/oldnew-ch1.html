<h1>Old Friends and New Loves</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../secretstars/index.html">Secret of the Stars</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hunterlink.html">Hunter Link</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Note: I&#39;ve noticed that there&#39;s a lack of Secret of the Stars 
fanfics out there (by &#39;lack&#39; ,I mean &#39;none at all&#39;), so I sought to 
change that. Net time I write a piece like this, I&#39;ll wait until it&#39;s 
NOT 3am to do it!*almost falls asleep*
----------------------------------------------

	Ten years after the Aqutallion warriors defeated the evil 
Homncruse, the people of the world have enjoyed so many years of peace. 
Ray decided to return home to Heart Island to help whoever needs it. 
Cody moved to Codo so that he can be around a girl he was crushing over. 
Dan returned to Braska to help with the rebuilding. Leona went back to 
her home in Decatas and to her low-life attitude. And Tina stayed in the 
town of Aris (which I named the town that was built at Old Hill) with 
her grandfather and caretaker.


	It was a lovely spring afternoon in the Town of Aris. Everyone, 
including the absent-mindid Dynamite, was enjoying the fresh air. Tina, 
on the other hand, was a bit saddened. She missed her friends and former 
travel companions, especially Ray. Although she had stopped thinking of 
him in any romantic way a while ago, she couldn&#39;t help wonder what her 
surrogate brother was up to. Shem oved her long-flowing blue hair out of 
her eyes and continued to look down at the ground, watching her red 
skirt flap around her slender legs as she walked.
	&quot;What&#39;s wrong, dear child?&quot; said an elderly voice behind her. She 
turned around and saw her friend, old Uncle Save. &quot;You look as if your 
favorite cat had died.&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s nothing.&quot; she said with a sigh. &quot;I was just thinking about 
the others.&quot;
	&quot;Ah yes. It has been a long time since either of us have seen 
them.&quot;
	&quot;Almost seven years. I hope they&#39;re doing okay....&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m sure they are. Th--&quot; A group of young children gathered 
around the elderly man. &quot;If you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;ve got some storytelling 
to do.&quot; he said as the children pulled him away from the young woman.
	Looking at the crest of stars that lay around her neck, Tina made 
a big decision. &quot;I&#39;ll do it!&quot; She then ran to her house to get ready to 
leave. As soon as she opened the door to her room, she was met with a 
pleasant surprise. &quot;Leona!? Is that you?&quot;
	&quot;In the flesh.&quot; the red-haired woman said. She was wearing tight 
blue jeans and a black halter top with a black denim jacket. She kept 
the winged headband so that her fellow Aqutallions would recognize her. 
&quot;I was in the neighorhood and decided to pop in and say &#39;hi&#39;.&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s so great to see you!&quot; Tina said as she hugged her friend. As 
soon as the two girls met during their quest, they became the best of 
friends. &quot;I was just about to go to Decatas to see you.&quot;
	&quot;Well, now you don&#39;t have to.&quot; Leona said with a smile. &quot;My! 
You&#39;ve grown more beautiful since the last time I saw you.&quot;
	Tina blushed a little. &quot;Thanks. So have you.&quot; Instead of changing 
almost everything in her wardrobe, like her friend did, Tina wore a 
slightly different uniform-style dress with the same colors. She had 
gotten used to wearing a blouse with longer sleeves and a longer skirt, 
but she still wore the same style sweater vest. She then noticed there 
was something on Leona&#39;s mind. &quot;Is there something you need to tell me?&quot;
	&quot;Kind of. There&#39;s something that I just only recently realized. 
It&#39;s one of the reasons I came to see you first.&quot;
	What is it?&quot;
	&quot;I don&#39;t know how to say this, but..............I&#39;m in love with 
you....&quot;
	Tina was absolutely speechless. She had never heard anyone, not 
even a boy, say that to her. Suddenly both her crest and Leona&#39;s started 
to shine brightly, as if signalling the beginning of something big. They 
then pulled the two women close together. Almost instinctly, they 
wrapped their arms around each other and shared a kiss. Since Leona was 
slightly taller, Tina had to crane her neck a little. When the light 
faded, they broke their kiss and Tina rested her head on Leona&#39;s 
shoulder.
	&quot;Does that mean what I think it means?&quot;
	&quot;Uh-huh.&quot;
	&quot;I wish we could tell the whole world!&quot;
	&quot;So do I, but it doesn&#39;t seem like a good idea.&quot;
	&quot;We can at least tell the others.&quot;
	&quot;Yeah. Let&#39;s do that.&quot;

	And so the new lovers went to tell the other Aqutallion warriors 
of their feelings for each other....
----------------------------------
AN: That has to be the shortest piece I&#39;ve written ever! It&#39;s definitely 
the first I&#39;ve ever completely finished. If you want a lemon for this 
one, don&#39;t hesitate to e-mail me.
See ya next time!
