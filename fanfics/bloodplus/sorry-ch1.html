<h1>I'm Sorry</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bloodplus/index.html">Blood+</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cbfg.html">Thecrazyrabbidfangirl</a><br> </h2>
<pre>On a dark and cold night in France, Saya slept peacefully inside the 
apartment that Red Shield was using as a temporary base on their search 
for Diva. A cold night breeze wafted in through the open balcony window, 
but Saya slept on, unaware of the danger that had slipped in with the 
breeze. 

Out of nowhere, Diva, the enemy they had been searching for for so long, 
phased in right next to Saya&#39;s bed. &quot;You left yourself so open, 
Saya-neesama&quot; Diva leered down at Saya &quot;It was rather pathetic how easy 
it was to find where you were hiding&quot;.  

Out of her dress pocket, Diva produced a dagger that glinted in the moon 
light; she slid her thumb across it, coating it in her poisonous blood. 
Diva brought the dagger up and was about to stab it down into Saya, but 
Saya turned over in her sleep. This caused Diva to pause, thinking Saya 
had awoken, but seeing she was still asleep she brought the dagger up 
again, thinking, &#39;It&#39;s been a fun game, Saya-neesama, but I&#39;m bored of 
it now, so I&#39;ll just end it&#39;. 

As Diva was about to stab down into Saya she heard Saya mumble something 
and hesitated again to listen to her: &quot;No... Don&#39;t die...&quot; Saya mumbled 
in her sleep. &quot;I&#39;ll help you... Diva... I&#39;ll help you... Just don&#39;t 
die!&quot; A tear slid down Saya&#39;s face as her words became unintelligible. 

Something struck Diva deep down and it caused her to ponder her actions.

&#39;Saya-neesama is dreaming about...helping me? Does she care about me? 
Should I really do this?&#39; Diva thought as the dagger kept inching 
towards Saya and kept being pulled back. 

&#39;This is Saya-neesama, the person who first listened to my song, who 
named me because of it, who let me out of that horrible tower... Could 
she actually care about me as I care for her?&#39; The dagger in Diva&#39;s hand 
quivered as she tried to decide what to do.  

Diva wasn&#39;t used to thinking about her actions. &#39;What if I hadn&#39;t done 
all those things Saya-neesama says are &#39;bad&#39; and &#39;wrong&#39;? Maybe we 
could&#39;ve been together...&#39; In truth Diva had always wanted to be with 
Saya, despite her childish, and most of the time malicious, nature she 
could still feel love, and Saya was the first person to ever be 
concerned about her, but Saya&#39;s constant hatred of what she&#39;d done had 
prevented Diva&#39;s feelings from ever being brought out. She had even made 
a song she had wanted to sing someday, just for Saya.  

&#39;All I ever wanted to do was get revenge on the humans for what they did 
to me; I didn&#39;t want you to hate me...&#39; A tear slid down Diva&#39;s cheek 
and fell onto Saya&#39;s as she bent down and kissed Saya in her sleep. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry,&quot; whispered Diva as she backed away from Saya&#39;s bed, and set the 
dagger down on the bedside table as she walked over to the balcony 
window, Diva turned back one last time. &quot;I love you, Saya-neesama,&quot; she 
whispered, and phased out of the room.  

Saya awoke in the middle of the night. She didn&#39;t know why, but she had 
a nagging feeling inside of her. She sat up in bed and felt something 
wet on her face. &#39;Was I crying?&#39; she thought, then looked over to the 
bedside table and gasped. There was the dagger still coated in Diva&#39;s 
blood. &#39;Could it have been Diva? Why didn&#39;t she kill me?&#39; she thought. 
Saya was distracted by a sound in the distance, and she listened 
closely: it sounded like Diva was singing...
