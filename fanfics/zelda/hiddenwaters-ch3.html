<h1>The Hidden Waters of the Heart (part 3 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../zelda/index.html">Legend of Zelda</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/missleanne.html">Diane "Miss Leanne" Taylor</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../zelda/hiddenwaters-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a>  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Two days after Ruto and Zelda 
parted ways in the Water Temple, Zelda met with Link in the frozen cave 
just beyond Zora’s Domain. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Their conversation was brief, 
but it managed to throw Zelda further into a state of confusion. Her 
feelings for Link felt as though they were amplified: “Time passes, 
people move. Like a river&#39;s flow, it never ends. A childish mind will 
turn to noble ambition. Young love will become deep affection. The clear 
water’s surface reflects growth.” It was a saying that Impa had 
often repeated to her during happier times. Impa’s intentions were 
to instruct the younger Zelda, but Zelda spoke to Link with more meaning 
behind those words. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She felt split between her 
attraction to Ruto and her tenderness for Link. Her encounters with 
Link were always very brief – what could come of them? But her encounter 
with Ruto had alerted her to odd sensations she had not imagined feeling 
and she was not completely convinced she had time to feel. She needed 
to rejoin Ganondorf’s court or else he might become suspicious of 
Sheik’s character. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As she turned her face towards 
her old childhood home, she found herself longing to immerse herself 
in the cool water once more, to be lost in a world in which she could 
not breathe, but in which she could lose her burdens. Zelda wished she 
could set her worries to the side for even a little while. In her day 
dreams, she talked with Ruto about things that did not revolve around 
Hyrule and its fate:</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Where do you see yourself 
living the longest?</i> Zelda asked Ruto in her mind. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Well, I know that there 
are Zoras who live outside Hyrule, </i>
Ruto answered. <i>Zoras who live in oceans, long rivers, and waterfalls 
– I want to see them, see what they are like. But I don’t know if 
I’ll </i>live<i> among them, or if I’ll travel about. But I do know 
that I want to travel beyond this country’s limits. What about you, 
Zelda?</i></font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>I don’t…I don’t know 
if I’ll ever be able to go beyond Hyrule. Especially not as Zelda, </i>
she replied. <i>My people don’t know I’m alive, but I wouldn’t 
be able to forgive myself if I just abandoned them. There isn’t anyone 
else to take the throne besides me. </i></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>And it’ll be a very lonely 
throne?</i> Ruto asked. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Maybe not forever,</i> Zelda 
said. <i>Maybe I’ll marry. Maybe I won’t. 
Or maybe I’ll be too busy to be lonely. But I’ll try to find a trust 
worthy friend amongst the sycophants and courtiers begging for my favors. </i></font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>But don’t you think that 
traveling beyond Hyrule would benefit your reign?</i> Ruto said. <i>
You would have the chance to see other cultures and gain new worldviews. </i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Traveling is a necessity, 
regardless of who you are or the distance you need to go, Ruto.</i> 
Zelda said. <i>But to stay away, to never have the responsibility of 
making decisions for the whole kingdom 
– that I long for. It’s not that I don’t want responsibilities, 
I want a different set of responsibilities. And yet, I want to see my 
kingdom restored to its former glory. I want to see it free, freer than 
I can ever be…</i></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda shook her head. Thoughts 
of defeating Ganondorf permeated her essence of being: she was little 
more than the desire to bring him down. Her identity was found in her 
intrinsic nature first, her status as regent princess second and her 
role as Sheik third, but she hadn’t counted on years of fighting a 
war that slowly chipped her into a new identity that constituted only 
leftovers from her previous identities. Her mission had become her singularity. </font> 
<br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda did not believe in looking 
back – <i>that is where regret is formed</i>, she said to herself 
– but the feeling of loss continued to permeate many of her thoughts. 
She wanted to grieve the loss of the little girl she had been when Ganondorf 
first took over the nation’s rule, but there was no time. She must 
fulfill her mission before it was too late. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">After several hours, Zelda 
reached the walls of Castle Town. Out of pure habit formed from years 
of wariness, she tightened her mask and set her right foot firmly forward 
to the broken drawbridge. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda, under the guise of Sheik, 
entered the open door to Ganondorf’s council chamber and saw the warlord 
alone in the room, sitting in his wooden chair with one elbow propped 
up on the table and his head resting upon his fist. At first, Zelda 
thought he was sleeping, but a change in angle proved that he was not 
sleeping, rather, deep in contemplation. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“My liege?” Sheik said 
very quietly, almost under his breath.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ganondorf looked up from his 
intense gaze upon the floor. “Sheik,” he said. Zelda bowed and he 
returned his gaze to the floor. Zelda stood in her place for several 
moments before Ganondorf spoke again. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Sheik, why do you serve 
me?” Ganondorf asked, bringing his gaze back up to look deep into 
Zelda’s eyes. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda’s insides quailed. <i>
This is no time to fear, Zelda!</i> </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“My lord, my people and are 
only made of shadows,” Zelda said. “If we do not have a form to 
fill, then we are of no substance or service at all.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“And whose form do you fill?” 
Ganondorf asked.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda was already quite uncomfortable 
with this line of questioning but there wasn’t a way out. Any unusual 
response she could give opened herself to exposure and arousing Ganondorf’s 
suspicions. <i>That is…unless…Ganondorf’s suspicions 
are already aroused</i>, Zelda thought. Her heart clenched at the brief 
thought. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Only the form you require 
of me, my lord,” Zelda said, hoping he only heard firm, decisive tones 
in Sheik’s voice. “Before you found me, I had nothing to hold onto, 
but you gave me that which I needed.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ganondorf watched Sheik’s 
face carefully, scanning his eyes and facial movements for hints. <i>
There’s more than just a mask on his face,</i> Ganondorf thought. <i>
He’s been trained to demonstrate little to no emotion 
– that much is clear. He doesn’t give that much away, but there’s 
something decidedly off here. </i></font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ganondorf broke the long silence. 
“Have you found the whereabouts of Princess Zelda?” He asked, not 
breaking his stare at Sheik’s face. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I have news. It may be old, 
but I know it is authentic,” Sheik said. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Indeed?” Ganondorf said, 
straightening in his chair. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I remember seeing this on 
the Princess myself before your lordship took control of Hyrule,” 
Zelda said, producing the cloth head covering that she had once worn 
as a child.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ganondorf took it from Sheik 
and examined it carefully, turning it over.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I also saw her wear it as 
a child,” Ganondorf said. Zelda feigned surprise. “Where did you 
find it?”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“There was an old house in 
Kakariko Village that seems to have been abandoned for several years,” 
Zelda said. “I found it there, as well as other items that did not 
seem to have a correlation between them and the Princess.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Hmmm,” Ganondorf said 
and said nothing more. He fingered the fabric of the head covering and 
gazed absentmindedly at a corner. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda had felt it safe to reveal 
the old hiding place for her and her nursemaid, Impa. Impa had gone 
on to protect the Temple of Shadow and Zelda was no longer there often 
enough to make an impression in the place. Even if Ganondorf sent his 
lackeys over to the house to search it for missing clues, they wouldn’t 
find any. Zelda had removed all the things she and Impa had considered 
precious to another location and left only uninteresting items behind. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Obviously, I’m going to 
ask you to continue to search for the Princess,” Ganondorf said. Sheik 
bowed. “But I’m glad to see some progress. It seems you broke into 
the Princess’s nursemaid’s stronghold, even if it had been abandoned.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Then, if I may continue 
my search…” Zelda said, allowing the implication to hang. Ganondorf 
inclined his head and dismissed Sheik. Zelda slipped out of the chamber 
as quickly as she could.  </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ganondorf waited until Sheik 
cleared the doorway before he spoke. “Sheik may not be Sheik at all,” 
Ganondorf said to the two witches floating silently out of the shadows 
to hover above behind his chair. “There was too much tentativeness 
in his voice this time. My questions seemed to have unnerved him.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Koume and Kotake did not say 
anything. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Have you been successful 
in discovering his true identity?” Ganondorf asked. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Kotake smiled and floated down 
to come directly before the evil ruler. “We may have an idea,” she 
said. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda immediately set course 
for the Water Temple and did not deviate from her path. The conversation 
with Ganondorf had unnerved her. Not even the brisk walk to Lake Hylia 
completely cleared her mind. She had no idea what her course of action 
would be: she couldn’t refuse Ganondorf’s summons to his councils 
and yet with each meeting, the feeling in her heart increased that Ganondorf 
did not believe in the disguise of Sheik. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>I can’t return to his 
stronghold,</i> Zelda thought.<i> I’ve never felt so exposed. The 
sooner Link awakens the Sages, the better. Ganondorf may already think…</i> 
She didn’t want to finish the thought. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda ran through the dark 
of night to fulfill her promise to Ruto – Zelda would return to her 
and take her to <i>El Dominio</i> to see if it had unfrozen. If it hadn’t, 
perhaps there was anything they could do. Perhaps Ruto and Link could 
collaborate on an idea about unfreezing the place. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda leaped over the fences 
enclosing the entrance to the Lake and continued running as hard as 
she could force her legs to pump. When she reached the edge of the water, 
she thought hard but briefly about the possibility of repeating her 
experience with the crazed barracuda. She was looking about for a safe 
way in when the Lake suddenly began to rise in volume – Ruto and Link 
had their victory!</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Quickly, Zelda dashed to an 
island adjacent to Lake Hylia’s center in which there was a solitary 
tree. <i>A better view, I need a better view! </i>
Zelda thought. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Just then, she heard a terrific 
amount of splashing, several deep breaths and the rustling of the tree. 
Zelda turned to see the source of the noises and saw that it was Link, 
climbing up onto the embankment and using the tree for help. Zelda quickly 
went to his side and pulled him onto the island. Link rolled over onto 
his back and flopped his arms to the side, breathing loudly. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Thank you, Sheik,” Link 
said. Zelda nodded in his direction and continued to watch the Lake 
rise. Link stood up noisily and adjusted his tunic and equipment strapped 
to his back. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I’m glad to see this Lake 
back to its former glory,” Link said, coming to stand behind Zelda. 
Zelda nodded again. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Oh! By the way,” he said, 
“Ruto wanted me to give you her thanks and a reminder.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda looked at Link and was 
surprised to see the younger man appearing to be quite embarrassed. 
Instantly, Zelda suspected that Link and Ruto had formed an attachment 
in regards to their “engagement” as children – a light spring 
of jealousy spewed forth in Zelda’s heart. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“And what was her reminder?” 
Zelda asked in Sheik’s voice. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Link hesitated and took a step 
forward but seemed to regret it. He took a deep breath and two steps 
forward, grabbed Zelda’s face and kissed her on the mouth through 
Sheik’s mask. Zelda was flabbergasted. Link wrinkled his noise and 
scrubbed his lips with the back of his gauntlet, quite embarrassed. </font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Obviously, it’s not the 
same giving it to me as it is her giving it to you,” Zelda said, nonplussed. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Yes, that’s one way to 
put it,” Link responded. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Rest your heart,” she 
said. “I accept Ruto’s thanks and remember our promise.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“What was your promise?” 
Link asked. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“That is for her and me to 
know,” Zelda replied lightly, sidestepping the question. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When Zelda walked across the 
Water Temple’s threshold, Ruto was already there waiting for her. 
For the first time since she left Ruto, she dropped Sheik’s mask and 
became Zelda. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Congratulations on your 
new status as Sage of Water,” Zelda said. She then detected a hint 
of sadness and a wisdom that she had not seen before in Ruto’s eyes. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Thank you,” Ruto said 
and bowed her head. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda began to doubt her previous 
assumption that something intimate had taken place between Ruto and 
Link. Ruto did not have the look of someone “well-loved,” and Link 
had been far too cheerful and genuinely energetic to make Zelda believe 
the two had quarreled. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Are you all right?” Zelda 
asked. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Yes, I just…got a glimpse 
of…I can’t really explain it,” Ruto said. “I don’t know how 
to. There really aren’t mortal words for those sights.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda had no idea what she 
was talking about but was interested in hearing Ruto at least try to 
describe what she saw.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Do you mean in terms of 
the creature ruling the Water Temple before you and Link cleansed it?” 
Zelda asked. At the mention of Link’s name, Ruto’s eyes took a strange 
glisten. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Goodness, no. This particular 
revelation took place just before I became the Water’s Sage,” Ruto 
said. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Now Zelda was truly intrigued. 
Ruto sighed. “Did you find anything to help you with Ganondorf?” 
she asked. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Nothing important, but I 
don’t believe I’m safe being in his councils or anywhere within 
his physical reach until Link’s ready to face him,” Zelda replied. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto frowned. “Truly?” 
She said. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda nodded. “He asked me 
strange questions today – very out of character for him.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto rolled her eyes to the 
sky. “As if we weren’t trying to be careful before,” she said. 
“We will have to be even more careful now. Who knows? Some of Ganondorf’s 
henchmen might be watching us even now. You are already implicated at 
least as a double agent if not actually Zelda.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I agree, but I feel as though 
I’ve painted myself into a corner,” Zelda said. “I don’t know 
what to do now. Do I continue to attend Ganondorf’s councils or do 
I stay away entirely?”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto’s face took on a thoughtful 
expression but she shook her head. “I don’t know how to advise you,” 
she said. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda sighed. “I need to 
stop thinking about it – it will drive me crazy if I continue. I came 
to take you back to <i>El Dominio</i>,” she said. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto looked at Zelda with a 
wary face. “It <i>may</i> be unfrozen,” Zelda said. “But I’m 
not certain – I could be wrong. I hope that since Link was there earlier 
that he may have been able to do something.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“But please, let’s go before 
we increase the chances of our being caught together,” Zelda said. 
“I want to see <i>El Dominio</i> and I want to see it with you.” 
Ruto smiled through the sadness in her eyes.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Once again, Zelda hung onto 
Ruto’s back, riding upstream back to Zora’s Domain, with Ruto leaping 
up every few seconds to allow Zelda to take a breath. When they arrived 
at Zora’s Domain, Zelda’s heart dropped to see the thick layer of 
ice still in place. Ruto and Zelda entered the Domain – Zelda watched 
Ruto’s mouth press into a thin line, her eyes widening with pain and 
anger. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I’m so sorry, Ruto,” 
Zelda said. “I had hoped for better.” Ruto didn’t answer immediately, 
her eyes quickly filled with tears. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I didn’t think it would 
be this way,” she said tremulously. “I didn’t see all the damage 
when you took me out…and after all we’ve done, we still have all 
this. Is evil going to be victorious, no matter what we do?”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda felt her frustration 
as if it were her own. Many times, she wondered if her mission to free 
Hyrule from Ganondorf’s reign was worth fighting for. Certainly, she 
had no doubts that it was the right thing to do, but all her efforts 
seemed to be like throwing drops of water down into a dry canyon.  </font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“It just feels like…” 
Ruto sniffed inelegantly and wiped her eyes with her hand. “It feels 
as though one problem goes away and another comes into its place. One 
war ends and another comes in behind it. One superpower nation rises 
and falls while another nation becomes a superpower after it. It’s 
just an endless cycle of entropy that will never completely end.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“No, it will not end,” 
Zelda said, wrapping her arms around Ruto’s shoulders. “But that 
doesn’t mean we should stop trying to lighten the burden of those 
who must bear these problems.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“My problems end when Zora’s 
Domain is unfrozen – you must fight on without me soon. Who is lightening 
the burden for you?” Ruto asked, turning to Zelda.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Well,” Zelda said, hesitating. 
“You have done much to lighten my burden.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I’m glad to hear of it,” 
Ruto said. Zelda felt satisfaction to hear that there was no bitterness 
in Ruto’s voice, but she wondered at the amount of feeling with which 
Ruto spoke.  </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda saw Ruto staring down 
into a corner of the first level of the Domain. “What’s over there?” 
Ruto asked. Zelda looked and there appeared to be a dark cave behind 
the frozen waterfall.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Let’s go and see,” Zelda 
said and tenderly took Ruto’s hand. She led Ruto down to the first 
level and carefully stepped over the ice. They entered the small cave 
and found it to be a rather snug area, but easily kept warm against 
the open air in the giant chamber of Zora’s Domain that fostered the 
icy temperature. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I need to rest here,” 
Ruto said, sighing and sinking down upon the floor against the wall. 
“This has been a long day.” Zelda heartily agreed. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda saw some old, thick sticks 
of wood in the short cave and struck sparks from flint upon them, setting 
them ablaze. Ruto scooted closer to the fire and crossed her legs, giving 
Zelda a very clear view of her light pink genitals. Zelda was thoroughly 
embarrassed that she had noticed – after all, Ruto was still quite 
distressed and this was <i>not</i> the time to be thinking like that. 
Nonetheless, she couldn’t help but stare. <i>It does not appear to 
be much different from a regular Hylian woman’s</i>, Zelda thought. <i>

In fact, I can’t tell any difference at all. At least, from what mine 
appears to be.</i></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Just as Zelda suspected might 
happen, Ruto caught her looking. Zelda expected a harsh verbal attack 
and she felt she deserved it. Instead, she opened her arms to Zelda 
and smiled her invitation. Zelda’s heart flipped in her ribcage at 
the profound implication. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She accepted Ruto’s invitation 
and sat down between her legs, closing Ruto’s arms around her body. 
She felt Ruto kiss the top of her head, bite the scarf off Zelda and 
tossed it aside. Zelda felt Ruto’s warm breath curling across her 
scalp, sending cool shivers down her back and into her groin. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Please,” Ruto whispered 
in Zelda’s ear. “Please let me return the favor you gave me those 
few days ago.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Your life back – is that 
a favor nowadays?” Zelda asked, trying for levity.</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“No,” she said. She buried 
her nose in Zelda’s hair, fragranced by the sun and plains of Hyrule. 
Ruto kissed her ear and felt Zelda shift closer to her. “I want to 
be warmed up by a princess,” Ruto replied. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Ah,” Zelda said. “Well…I…I’ve 
secretly hoped you would do more with me than I did with you – at 
first, that is.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“At first? I believe I’m 
the one who’s made all the advances up until now. You’ve been watching 
me?” Ruto asked. “Like I watched you so many years ago?”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I’ve just watched you 
with the eyes of an adult,” Zelda said. “In my heart, I’ve treasured 
a dormant love for you, Ruto. And I’m so happy to find it alive and 
well.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto’s eyes filled with happy 
tears. “Where there is life, there is love,” she whispered. </font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda pulled Ruto’s face 
down to hers and kissed Ruto with all her might. Ruto returned the kiss 
with as much passion and took the kiss a step further, sliding her tongue 
into Zelda’s mouth. Zelda welcomed the invasion and her body grew 
slack in Ruto’s lap. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda trailed her kisses from 
Ruto’s mouth to her cheek and down her neck. Ruto moaned her pleasure 
and tightened her grip around Zelda’s body – not for the last time. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“If you take off your clothes, 
I shall keep you warm,” Ruto said teasingly. Zelda blushed and seemed 
to balk. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Oh, now that isn’t fair 
– I can’t be the only one here to go with out clothing,” Ruto 
nudged. “You can spare a few moments without your wrappings, can’t 
you?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda squeezed her eyes shut 
in delighted embarrassment, but she stood up before Ruto and untied 
the strings around her shirt. She loosed the wrappings upon her breasts 
to keep them from hurting when she ran and her torso was free. Zelda 
unbound the string attached to her tight pants and stepped out of them. 
At last, completely unencumbered, she stood before Ruto shyly. </font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto gazed upon her lover, 
admiring the way the firelight brought out the rosiness of Zelda’s 
skin. The light shone prominently on Zelda’s hips, inner and outer 
thighs. In the midst of her silent worship, Ruto realized something. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You wear no underwear?” 
Ruto practically shouted in surprise. “If I had known that you do 
not, I would not have waited so long to take you!”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There was no one anywhere in 
the vicinity, but Zelda was desperate for quiet. “Shhhh…. yes, I 
know,” she said. “It’s less troublesome that way, there’s not 
as much to get in the way if I need to fight.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto laughed and opened her 
arms to Zelda. “Now, let me hold you,” she said. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda smiled. “So demanding, 
my Ruto is,” she said. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“But you know you like it,” 
Ruto replied with a sly smile. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda slid back into Ruto’s 
lap and she reveled in the shared warmth between their bodies. She loved 
the feeling of Ruto’s stomach against her side and the feel of Ruto’s 
arms around her shoulders. Best of all, she loved Ruto’s eyes looking 
into her own. It gave her the strength to press into the natural conclusion 
she knew approached. Ruto kissed her lips lightly as Zelda regarded 
her and combed her fingers through her hair. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I love it – don’t ever 
cut it,” Ruto said, kissing the tips of Zelda’s hair. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“If you don’t want it cut, 
it shall not be cut,” Zelda replied. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto grinned and hoisted Zelda 
up onto her knees. Zelda didn’t have much time to wonder what Ruto 
was up to – she felt the sensation of Ruto’s gentle tongue upon 
her breast, not just kisses this time. Zelda leaned her head back and 
sighed deeply – it was rapidly becoming too much. </font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I’ve never done this before,” 
Zelda said in a low voice.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Neither have I,” Ruto 
replied. “I’m making this up as I go along, but you don’t see 
me stopping, do you?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto gave one good suck upon 
the bottom part of Zelda’s breast before she dragged her tongue to 
Zelda’s areola and traced a slow, spiraling pattern around the edge 
and into the center towards Zelda’s nipple. Ruto’s tongue touched 
upon its main target and pushed upwards on the nipple. Zelda arched 
her back in response, amazed at the amount of sensation concentrated 
in one tiny area of her body. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">While Ruto continued to suck 
upon the one breast, she reached up to the other with her free hand 
and began to squeeze it rhythmically. The two sensations combined were 
already bringing Zelda to a state of arousal she had not yet dreamed 
of encountering. She felt her vulva begin to heat and moisten in response 
to Ruto’s stimulation. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>I wonder what Link would 
think if he saw us like this. Does he have any idea what his 
“fiancée” is doing with me?</i> Zelda couldn’t help but feel 
a small amount of glee: she had the princess Ruto – Link did not. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The aching in her vagina increased 
– hotter and hotter, like a growing fire in her groin. She longed 
to rub the tension out with her fingers, but dared not take her hands 
off Ruto’s shoulders for fear of truly losing control long before 
she wanted to.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">At last, Ruto finished working 
her mouth upon Zelda’s right breast and switched over to the left 
one, beginning that arousing spiral upon Zelda’s areola. Ruto also 
began working on the right breast with her other hand. Ruto rolled Zelda’s 
nipple very, very gently upon her teeth with her tongue. “Stop! I 
can’t take any more!” Zelda cried out, breathing hard and deeply. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto appeared amused. “Do 
you really think that we can stop now?” She said playfully. “We’ve 
started this wagon rolling – why would we stop?”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I didn’t mean stop completely,” 
Zelda said, trying to catch her breath. “I meant, let me try doing 
it on you.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto grinned widely. “I apologize, 
my dear Princess,” she said grandly. “I shall not dare oppose your 
will again!”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“And I’ll hold you to that,” 
Zelda replied as she laid Ruto flat on the ground and straddled Ruto’s 
sides between her legs. Zelda’s vulva was already quite wet and she 
was secretly delighted that it left its shiny mark on Ruto’s leg as 
she slid upwards to have her first encounter with Ruto’s breasts. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">At first, Zelda thought only 
to imitate Ruto’s loving actions with her own breasts. But Zelda decided 
to take it a step further. Instead of starting the tongue spiral on 
the edge of Ruto’s areola, Zelda started at the bottom of her breast 
and made a much longer circle around before she began to work her way 
to the center. However, before she began the circles, she licked the 
thumb of her left hand and began to gently rocked Ruto’s left nipple 
back and forth, taking care not to bend it too far. Between the circles 
upon Ruto’s right breast and the manipulation of her left nipple, 
Ruto moaned with vigor. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">To Zelda’s delight, she felt 
Ruto’s hand slip between their bodies and down to her vulva. When 
Ruto first touched Zelda’s front, her body started and quivered in 
anticipation. The teasing foreplay had done much to prepare her and 
she found herself quite responsive to Ruto’s simple touch. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda broke her concentration 
on Ruto’s breasts and could only breathe through her mouth, stunned 
at the sensations she could not begin to describe. The wild flicker 
of the firelight seemed to imitate Zelda’s rhythmic breaths. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Suddenly, Ruto’s odd tone 
of voice and distant appearance when Zelda first greeted her that day 
came back to her mind. Despite their advanced stage of lovemaking, Zelda’s 
curiosity consumed her and she asked, “Do you think you could explain 
what you saw in the Chamber of Sages at the moment you were made the 
Water’s Sage?”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto paused, apparently at 
a loss for words and mildly annoyed at the interruption to their love-making. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Can we not save it for later, 
dear?” She asked. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“We could,” Zelda said. 
“But I am dreadfully curious. It’s been nagging at my mind all day.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto sighed and brought Zelda 
closer to her. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I saw…the creation of 
our country,” Ruto said. “I saw the fiery destruction at the end 
of the ages and I saw <i>everything in between</i>. I cannot really 
describe it past that.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You watched the day the 
Goddesses forged the lands, created the people, created the plants and 
animals?” Zelda asked. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“That seems to be a part 
of the big picture,” Ruto said. “Rather I saw the minute creations 
of all living things, the lifetimes of every single person who was ever 
to walk the earth. It was too much to take in all at once. <i>Everything</i> 
that ever was or ever will exist came into being in that one moment, 
that one spoken word, that one breath.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda couldn’t begin to visualize 
what Ruto saw. “I wish I could have been there to see,” she said. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto turned to her with sadness 
in her eyes. “What’s wrong?” Zelda asked. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto hesitated. “In that 
mad whirl of creation, I saw you,” Ruto said. “I saw you in the 
history of Hyrule.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda bated her breath. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Suffice it to say,” Ruto 
said, “that you will also be able to experience what I experienced…but 
at a later time.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda’s mind spun at the 
implication behind Ruto’s words. “You can’t…possibly mean…” 
she stammered. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto opened and closed her 
mouth and closed her eyes. “My Princess,” she said, “my Queen…my 
Sage of Sealing.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda’s eyes spilled over 
with tears. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You have had a longer journey 
than mine, Zelda,” Ruto said quietly. “And it is not finished yet 
– without a doubt, you have one last task before Ganondorf is gone, 
but I have every confidence that you will do it.”</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Do you see,” Ruto said, 
lifting Zelda’s chin to meet her eyes, “you see will be needed just 
as much as Link is needed – just as much as the rest of us will be 
needed? A single person cannot win a war or battle.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda could not say anything. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto continued. “You have 
never,” she whispered, “and will never walk alone.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda smiled her gratefulness. <i>
There is nothing to replace love and the support that goes with it</i>, 
she thought.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">They began their ministrations 
to one another again and Zelda finally summoned enough courage to touch 
Ruto’s own vulva, wondering if it would feel the same as hers did. 
With the tips of her fingers spreading a bit of Ruto’s slickness, 
Zelda decided that Ruto’s nether lips were a little tougher than hers, 
simply because Ruto was exposed to the elements more frequently than 
Zelda herself was. And yet, Ruto was still quite soft to the touch. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The firelight illuminated the 
shining moisture running down between the rosy clefts of Ruto’s vulva, 
casting an orange glow upon her pink skin framed by blue. The more Zelda 
gazed at Ruto’s genitals, the more she marveled at their perfection. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda had the sudden urge to 
try something new and a little daunting. She stopped her kisses on Ruto’s 
lips, moved down past her belly and brought her mouth close to Ruto’s 
vulva. She looked to Ruto for assurance and only saw her stunned face. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Hold still,” Zelda said 
tremulously and ran the tip of her tongue on the outside of Ruto’s 
nether lips. Ruto groaned and shuddered, assuring her Queen that she 
was doing the right thing. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Part of Zelda imagined Ruto 
would taste “fishy,” but this was not the case. To be sure, Ruto 
had her own light musk, but it was tolerable if not pleasant. This consideration 
gave Zelda the courage to press ahead – she quickly slid her tongue 
into the inside of Ruto’s nether lips, taking care to be very gentle. 
Ruto begged for more with wordless sighs, carrying Zelda’s face with 
one hand to the top of her sex, the center of her sensuality.  </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda did as she was told, 
trying to be even more gentle because as soon as she touched her lips 
to Ruto’s clitoris, the other woman practically screamed. Obviously, 
this was more of a sensitive spot than Zelda had first wagered – she 
would need to tread carefully or else she could hurt Ruto. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Curious as to what Ruto’s 
vagina would feel like, she touched her entrance with the tip of her 
finger and entered slowly, all the while barely managing to keep her 
sucking rhythm constant upon Ruto. Ruto arched her back. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Enough!” Ruto cried. “Allow 
me to reach my peak at the time that you will.” </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Overcome with epicurean heat, 
Zelda simply nodded and lifted herself off the ground. Ruto helped her 
into a kneeling position with her legs widely spread and Ruto imitated 
her position. Zelda suspected what she would do – at the same moment, 
each brought their hands to their lover’s cores and began an equal 
rhythm to which they rocked against each other. Covering one another’s 
faces with kisses, they became helpless with their arousal and passion. </font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Try it faster?” Zelda 
asked and both she and Ruto sped up their timing. The reward was fantastic 
– Zelda felt as though she could have exploded. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Just a little faster,” 
came Ruto’s hoarse voice and Zelda put all her strength into making 
the motion of her hands quicker. Rubbing down the front of the vulva 
and into the vagina, all the while keeping the clitoris of their lover 
in constant action – their climax was by no means simultaneous, but 
they came close enough together that Zelda felt that it was only further 
confirmation of their  love. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda and Ruto clung to each 
other, shivering in post-coital delight and continuing to keep one another 
warm. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“So…” Zelda said while 
they lay in one another’s arms. “Link seemed to think fondly of 
you.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto did not look at Zelda 
immediately. “Did he now?” She said ambiguously. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Apparently, he believes 
your engagement to be serious, regardless of your belief that it is 
not,” Zelda replied.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“And how does that make you 
feel?” Ruto said with a small smile. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“He’s a good friend of 
mine, but…you may not have him!” Zelda said, trying to keep a tone 
of playfulness in her voice. She lightly punched Ruto’s arm to punctuate 
her point. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“But you said yourself that 
he seemed to think our engagement serious,” Ruto replied. “I am 
not one to taint my honor with broken promises – I most assuredly 
won’t renege on such a powerful commitment.” </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I say he is mine and has 
been from the moment I laid eyes upon him as a child!” Zelda raised 
her voice.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You simply laid eyes upon 
him – I gave him an engagement ring, the Zora’s Sapphire!” Ruto 
replied gleefully. “He’s mine.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“No, he’s mine,” Zelda 
shot back with more playfulness.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I think he’s mine,” 
Ruto said, matching Zelda’s tone and leaning her forehead against 
Zelda’s so their eyes could meet. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“He’s mine!” Zelda exclaimed. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“He’s <i>mine</i>!” Ruto 
shouted back. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Both women dissolved into fits 
of laughter, Zelda fully relaxing and stretching out onto Ruto’s belly, 
but she quickly arched backwards when Ruto resumed her gentle stroking. 
Zelda openly pushed herself against Ruto’s fingers and kissed Ruto’s 
mouth repeatedly, demanding as much attention from both her mouth and 
her fingers as possible. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“But think of this, Zelda,” 
Ruto said when their lips parted. “We were one another’s before 
either one of us knew Link existed.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“It’s the truth and I delight 
in it,” Zelda replied and kissed Ruto with as much ardor as she could 
summon. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In their drowsy state, neither 
one of them  saw at that moment a tiny trickle of water snaking 
its way down the waterfall’s frozen arch. <i>El Dominio </i>
began to thaw from the top down. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda forced herself to leave 
Ruto and <i>El Dominio</i> soon after their love was sated. It was the 
last thing she wanted but her consolation was that it would keep Ruto 
and their secret safe. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When Zelda left in the disguise 
of Sheik, she would have done well to look high above the entrance to 
Zora’s Domain. If she had, she might have seen two witches on floating 
brooms silently watching her. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda’s true trials had just 
begun.</font></p>
