<pre>&quot;Here yah go, miss, have yourself a good day.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, good sir.&quot;

Malon Long smiled as the elderly man dropped her off in front of the 
drawbridge to Hyrule Castle.  The pretty redhead, now age 17 and quite 
popular with the young man of the Kingdom, had decided to pay a visit 
to the Castle today.

Since her Father had no runs to make till after lunch time, and she
didn&#39;t want to waste her free day off sitting around the farm with the
horses and hay, she thankfully remembered the nice old man who regularly
came pass the ranch and so she had asked him nicely if he wouldn&#39;t mind
dropping her off.

Dressed in a plain, but still lovely blue dress, Malon soon crossed the 
bridge while smiling at the young guards watching her pass by.  Though 
she loved the attention these days from the men, her interest had for 
months laid elsewhere.

For today, she had planned visiting a few friends, Link being one of 
them she had planned to visit since he was in Hyrule for now.  It was 
nice seeing the dashing young man once in awhile, though she missed the 
brief relationship that they had shared.  But she regretted nothing 
that she had done with one of Hyrule&#39;s local heroes, it was a wild ride 
and she did have fun with him.

Entering the as always busy Market Place, Malon wandered around looking 
at the many booths as she tried to see if anything today would catch 
her interest.

As she passed a fruit booth, the young lady of LonLon caught sight of a 
familiar face.  Well two familiar faces in fact, one being the young man
she wanted to see and chat with, the other she was hoping to see to 
make an appointment for later on.

&quot;Link! Hey LINK!&quot; The pretty red-haired girl called out, trying to get 
her voice to reach the boy from the other side of the Market, &quot;Hey 
Fairy-boy, come over here!&quot;

Seeing as her pet name had finally gotten his attention, as well as the 
young woman he was talking to, Malon watched as the two pushed their 
way through the crowd coming up long side her.

&quot;Hiya Mal!&quot; greeted Link, &quot;I was hoping I might see you before I go off 
on another of my crazy quests.&quot;

&quot;Good to see you Link!&quot; Malon cheerfully returned, throwing her arms 
around the boy as she gave him a good squeeze. &quot;It gets boring around 
here without you and I bet your lady friend here misses you just as 
much.&quot;

This &quot;lady friend&quot; hmph&#39;ed at that as Malon released the red-faced boy.

&quot;Miss him? You mean miss whacking him since he&#39;s never here?&quot; the 
dark-haired girl grumbled.

&quot;Oh hush, Tetra, he is a busy boy ain&#39;t you, Fairy-man?&quot; she teased, 
while Link chuckled nervously as he scratched the back of his head.

&quot;Well, I gotta earn a living and all...&quot;

&quot;And what of me? Mr. Hero?&quot; the girl named Tetra growled.

Malon once more was greeted to other of Link and Tetra&#39;s arguments.  It 
seemed these days they fought over this same subject endlessly but 
always found the will to makeup and keep their rocky relationship 
going.

&quot;Well,&quot; she finally interrupted, seeing that Link was losing badly in 
the argument once more, &quot;it&#39;s good that you got back today, and its good
I run into you too Tetra.&quot;

&quot;Huh? Why&#39;s that Malon?&quot; Asked Link, confused.

Tetra only rolled her eyes as she regarded her friend.

&quot;So I&#39;m guessing you want to see if she is free for the afternoon, 
huh?&quot; The girl seem to drop into thought as if trying to recall 
something, &quot;well from what I remember she should have nothing special 
planned.&quot;

&quot;Planned? Huh?&quot;

Malon glanced at the dense boy, giggling slightly at the silly look on 
his elfish features.

&quot;I pity you at time, Tetra,&quot; the other girl shrugged as she slapped 
Link on the back.

&quot;He maybe dense and a little slow, but his still mine and I&#39;m not 
giving him back to you, Red.&quot;

Malon only snorted at that but smiled at Link.

&quot;Link, why don&#39;t you treat your old friend Mally here to something to 
eat while Tetra does me a little favor for me, huh?&quot;

Link looked to one girl to the other, one his ex-girlfriend and the 
other his current, then shrugged.

&quot;Oh right, since I do have extra rupees on me but,&quot; he poked her in the 
shoulder, &quot;no buying anything behind my back like last time since I do 
need to eat and all.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah, lets get going since I&#39;m hungry and I smell some good food 
over there.&quot;

And with that said, Tetra watched her friend drag her boyfriend over to 
a nearby food stand.

&quot;That girl, you think she was still interest in him.&quot; Of course she 
knew better unlike the other girls in their age group.  But it was 
better this way, since she knew no-one would be overly happy if they 
learned of a little secret that only she knew of.

Walking off towards the Castle, Tetra barely heard the words &#39;Costs 
THAT much!?&quot; as she left the Market.

* * * *

Princess Zelda the 3rd, current heir to the throne of the people of 
Hyrule, was currently sitting on her chair in front of her mirror.  The 
young Princess had just came from a long and tiring lunch with her 
Father.  Although she didn&#39;t mind having lunch with him, she preferred 
it be in private and not with the Kingdom&#39;s advisers and visiting 
nobles. 

But now that was all over and done with, she now had time to relax and 
enjoy the afternoon.

And the news Tetra, her personal servant and friend, had gave her she 
was looking forward to the afternoons activities.

It had been over a week since she had seen her.  She usually had her 
special meetings in private with her companion around every 5 or so 
days.  But since she had been busy the other day she wasn&#39;t able to see 
her lover.

Though it wasn&#39;t unusual to have one at her age, she knew her male 
friend Link was intimate with Tetra, her own companion was female.

It was interesting on how she had met her.  It had happened not long 
after Link broke off his relationship with her and fell in love with 
Tetra, her sharp-tongued friend.

She had found the girl in all places her private garden, sitting in the 
grass looking somewhat down.  She had nearly snapped out at the pretty 
thing for being in a place she wasn&#39;t allowed.  But as the girl lifted 
her head to meet her hot gaze, something inside of her seem to crack as 
she gazed into the beauty of her baby blue eyes.  The girl kneeling in 
the grass before her was stunning in beauty, even in the old looking 
dress she was wearing she was a sight that you couldn&#39;t forget.

So she had found herself swallowing hard as she tried to keep the blush 
from creeping up to her cheeks.  She knew she was attracted to women as 
well as men but she had never came across such a female that sparked 
such feelings of attraction.

It was later once coxing the girl to sit with her that she learned her 
name.  She had shortly after learned that Link of all people had left 
her here, saying he would be back shortly as he went looking for 
someone named Tetra.

It was surprising that a simple farm girl, though gifted with shining 
beauty, knew the Kingdom&#39;s youngest Hero.  And greater surprise was 
learning that she had been once attached to him, saying that they been 
seeing each other for months but had finally decided to break off their 
relationship not long ago because she wanted a more stable 
relationship.

Zelda had soon learned the girl had been here for over a hour, feeling 
depressed as she knew her old boyfriend was looking for his new lover 
while she now had no one to turn to for comfort and affection.

So the Princess had found herself taking pity on the girl and found 
herself leading her to her Bedchambers, saying it would be better here 
to wait for Link and Tetra to show up then in the cool late afternoon 
air.

She still wondered how things developed from friendly chatter to hot 
kisses and roaming hands.  She guessed Malon had found her attractive 
as well, and Zelda guessed the signals she was giving off had sparked 
what happened next.

But as she laid beside the girl, trailing her hands over the body of her
first lover, of all people Tetra had burst in asking if the Princess 
had seen a red haired girl.

So of course once the servant had seen the so-called missing girl in 
the arms of her Princess, she had quickly shut the door behind her and 
looked over the two red-faced girls in a most curious fashion.

It had took some time to settle things.  The missing girl had 
recognized the new girl&#39;s name and once she had formally introduced 
herself, the girl named Telra smiled and started to get to know her 
boyfriend&#39;s Ex.

Once they had finished all the talking, Tetra had promised not to 
spread this around the castle, mainly since she didn&#39;t want to hurt her 
friend and Princess.

Zelda was soon shaken from her thoughts as the door to her chambers was 
opened.

&quot;Zelda, you here?&quot; a light voice asked.

&quot;Yes I&#39;m here, come in quick.&quot;

The Princess turned to face her visitor, her lover in fact as she stood 
to embrace her.

&quot;Its good to see you, Malon, I was hoping you might make a visit 
today.&quot;

Returning the affectionate hug, the red-haired girl snuggled into the 
other girl&#39;s arms as she said, &quot;well since Daddy did give me the day 
off, I thought I&#39;ll come see my favorite little Princess.&quot;

Moving them towards her bed, the Princess started to plant kisses on 
Malon&#39;s neck.

&quot;Well I&#39;m happy to see you, not to mention my hormones.&quot;

&quot;Oh you, you Sex crazy Princess!&quot; Giggled the farm girl as she started 
to undress her lover.

&quot;For the rest of the day, your all mine...&quot; Zelda moaned, as their lips 
meet and soon made love to her Mistress...


...End


Author Notes:
Whoa, talk about a spar of the moment story.  I guess reading 
other people&#39;s fanfiction can inspirer you, though its been ages since 
I&#39;ve wrote a Zelda fic.

Anyways, hope you Zelda yuri fans liked, and if I get enough 
feeback I maybe even do a lemon, or even better, a mini-series...who 
knows.

Until next time...
