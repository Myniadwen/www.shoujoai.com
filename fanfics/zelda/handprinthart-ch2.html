   <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It was the first time we made 
love, but thank the Goddesses it wasn’t the last.  </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I asked Midna to stay that 
night, and she did; she even stayed the next day. Grief for the passing 
of my father continued to hang in my heart, but it did not overwhelm 
me as it had before. The daily rigors of a ruling Hylian Royal continued 
to threaten to break my figurative back, but I did not feel the stresses 
as before. Midna’s love transformed me anew each day, and tossed me 
into a great sky where the troubles of this life are practically meaningless.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A few of my courtiers noticed 
the change in my eyes and gossiped among themselves that their Regent 
Princess had finally accepted a suitor, or at least had written an excellent 
new policy. I only smiled when I overheard the murmurs in the kitchens 
and hallways. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Oh, but they had no inkling. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Months passed as short days. 
Midna continued her search for the Hero Beast in the night, and often 
came to be with me during the day. We made the most of our evenings 
together, and watched the twilight come and dissolve into night. As 
the pale moments between the recession of the light and advancement 
of the darkness in the sky came and went, I considered how transient 
our existence is. Our lives are nothing more than a brief flicker of 
a struck flint in the face of a raging bonfire. And yet, however ephemeral 
our passing days are, we consider them to be a deserved right. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Ephemeral</i>...Mine and 
Midna’s time together felt fleeting and immaterial, not unlike our 
twilight vigil. We guarded our time together, cultivated those moments 
and tended the tiny things in our relationship. She and I understood 
that one night might be our last together, and that last night would 
not leave without one more loving word, one more caress, one more kiss. 
We are never guaranteed our next breath, especially not a chance at 
love. But there I was, breathing Midna’s scent and reveling in love. 
Impossibly beautiful moments. Ours was the miracle romance. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In the dark cover of night, 
Midna and I talked for hours on end in my favorite length of gardens. 
The first time I took her down from my room and showed her each of the 
trees, flowers, and bushes, her mouth dropped and she openly stared. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Do you not have a garden 
like this in your home?” I asked. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The honey-suckle potent air 
was clingy and delightful – I have always loved that smell. I heard 
Midna suck in a lungful. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I have nothing like this,” 
she said. “Not anything I have can compare to this.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We walked the carefully laid 
cobble-stoned path and kept close to the shadows of the trees. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I spoke up: “What do you 
have in the way of gardens?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She answered, “We don’t 
have gardens. What natural beauty we have is in our sky.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My interest was immediately 
piqued. “Tell me of your skies,” I said.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She blew air through taut lips, 
creating a <i>pbbbbbttt</i> sound. “My Rose-elda, if I told you about 
my skies, would you dash off to my world and leave your kingdom behind? 
You wouldn’t have the reputation of a good ruler anymore, eh?”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You would make a perfectly 
good Regent in my stead,” I said, smirking. I doubt she saw it – 
the clouds had shifted over the stars, blocking our light source.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Oh, really, and what kind 
of ruler would you be in <i>my</i> kingdom?” She asked suspiciously.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Every good ruler knows that 
the first thing to do when ascending the throne is to cut taxes for 
their first year. Most likely I would cut <i>all </i>
taxes, run wine in the fountains and give free food – all of which 
would be at the expense of the Twilight royal treasury,” I said, smiling. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“And what would that accomplish?” 
Midna said. I know she already knew the answer. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Your people would love me 
to death and then when you came back to claim your own throne, you would 
be forced to create new taxes to replenish the treasury,” I said. 
“Your people would simply <i>love </i>
me – and be thoroughly disgusted with you!” I laughed. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You would give them so much 
food that they wouldn’t be able to work to make money for me to tax,” 
Midna said with a playful surliness. I grinned and we continued to walk, 
arriving at a circular courtyard with a wide entrance. I changed the 
subject when we paused in the middle of the enclosure.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“This is the place where 
it is said that the Hero of Time and our original Queen Zelda met for 
the first time,” I said. Midna and I looked at the low platform at 
the far north of the courtyard. Its steps were the perfect height for 
a child’s feet – indeed, this place was given the unofficial name 
of <i>Children’s Haven</i>. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“What is <i>their</i> story?” 
She asked, gazing at the platform. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I began, “The Hero of Time 
was a simple Hylian child raised in the Kokiri Forest—“ </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“What is ‘Kok-iri?’” 
Midna asked. Her heavy accent butchered the word.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“It was<i> </i>
once a spirit that lived in an ancient, enchanted forest. These spirits 
would inhabit the bodies of children and those bodies would never grow 
old,” I answered. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“They never died?” Midna 
asked. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“No, they never died naturally. 
But many centuries after the death of the Hero of Time, they simply 
disappeared. No one in Hyrule knows how or why – most Hylians were 
never allowed in that enchanted forest under penalty of death,” I 
said. “But you interrupted my story.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Sorry,” Midna said noncommittally. 
It seemed her apology was meant to be taken at face value. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I began again, “The Hero 
of Time was a simple Hylian child raised in the Kokiri Forest, and our 
ancestor Queen Zelda was also a child at that time. Events happened 
in the Hero’s forest that ejected him, and he began his search for 
answers. He happened upon a girl in the marketplace of Hyrule who was 
willing to help him, but the future Hero of Time later discovered that 
the girl-child was none other than Princess Zelda.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna interjected again, “Right, 
because she shouldn’t have been married as a child, so she wouldn’t 
have had the title of Queen.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Yes,” I was growing mildly 
impatient. “She would not have been Queen at the time she and the 
Hero met.” I lurched ahead in my story to keep Midna from interrupting 
again. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I started, “Zelda and our 
Hero—“</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“The name of your Hero again 
– what is it?” Midna cut in again. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I rolled my eyes to the midnight 
heavens. “His name was Link, but we call him our Hero or Hero of Time 
out of respect.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Since you called your Royal 
ancestor by her birth name, it shouldn’t be an issue to call the Hero 
by his birth name,” she said. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I was quite prepared to give 
up and ask if she was ready to go to bed and sleep. But she asked, “What 
is the rest of the story?” So I began again, but meant to give an 
abbreviated version.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Link and Zelda formed a 
bonding relationship as children during their quest to protect the Triforce. 
Then one day the desert demon King Ganondorf came and made a coup d’état 
of the kingdom. Zelda fled with her guardian and was hidden, Link went 
through his legendary sleep of seven years. After the seven years had 
passed, Link awoke, defeated Ganondorf’s strongholds, and discovered 
Zelda again; they married, had children, continued their line. And that 
is all there is to that story,” I finished, stretched and took a deep 
breath. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I thought Midna had been sufficiently 
silenced, but apparently not. “How many children did they have?” 
She said. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I realized how sore my muscles 
were – I was ready for sleep. “They birthed four children,” I 
answered. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“<i>Hurrr, </i>
that is interesting!” Midna whuffled – why it was interesting, I 
couldn’t understand. I would have to ask about the average amount 
of children Twili families had on another night. My weariness was starting 
to show through as irritation, and I did not want to end this night 
on a spat. She had one more question, though.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“For Queen Zelda and the 
Hero to marry,” she said. “You called her your ancestor, did you 
not?” I nodded.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Then you are <i>their </i>

descendant, true?” she asked. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I am,” I said simply, 
then took her by the arm. I was finished for the evening and ready for 
sleep. “I’m taking you back to bed,” I commanded.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Aaah-haaa,” Midna drawled. 
“So you are going to be the leader in the relationship now?”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I wasn’t aware there <i>
was</i> a leader in our relationship!” I said. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna’s face twisted into 
a smiling frown, but she didn’t answer. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I laughed, feeling my shoulder 
muscles unwind and smooth out. I led her to bed and the noctural activites 
that awaited. When the sun rose the next morning, Midna was already 
gone, yet I felt the sensation of a lingering kiss on my mouth. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I love you, too, Middie,” 
I whispered to the air. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna didn’t come to me at 
all that next week. She didn’t come at night, she didn’t appear 
at twilight, she didn’t come at all. Her absence threatened to consume 
me, but I had no reason to suspect that something was wrong. It wasn’t 
until a fortnight after our last night together past, I knew in my heart 
of hearts that something was amiss, but in the occasions that I rolled 
back into my subconscious to see what was on our mental bridge, nothing 
appeared to be out of place. I did not hear her singing or her odd speeches 
to the cosmos and this distressed me. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It wasn’t until over a month 
after her departure that I felt an odd disturbance in the air around 
me. The memory of the silent bridge made me reach out into my mind to 
attempt touch Midna over our mental bridge. With a cold shock, I realized 
that something that something was missing since I had last searched 
our mental planes for her. Midna’s presence could not be felt at all, 
my mind’s eye could not perceive through the dark fog and the air 
had a humid, stifling feel to it. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I sat in my meditating room 
when I probed our bridge for the second time after her departure. My 
meditations took place on the wooden floor in those days, with staring 
sessions at colorful, abstract mural on the northern wall to help with 
my spiritual ponderings. Normally the mural calmed my soul, but at that 
moment it symbolized the turmoil and chaos that was just beginning. 
It was just beginning, and I wasn’t doing anything to stop it… </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>...Couldn’t</i> do anything 
to stop it. <i>Too late</i> came the strange, clarion call.  </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My subconscious tickled and 
I dove back into my mind. My mind’s voice called to Midna from my 
side of the bridge. “Middie…Midna!” I searched, praying for an 
answer, but received nothing, not even a hint. I quickly made the decision 
to walk over the bridge and onto Midna’s plane – I was only beginning 
to feel the desperation for help. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As I walked over, several streaks 
of red formed on a tall, distant boulder on Midna’s plane and began 
making intricate patterns as it spread onto the ground. At first its 
development was slow, but as I came closer to investigate, they spread 
more quickly. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My mind screamed alarms. I 
called for Midna again and no one answered. The lines began traveling 
towards me. More alarm bells sounded in my mind’s ears, but when I 
turned to run my feet felt as though they were clad in iron. The patterns 
formed about my feet and were holding me in place; I cried out for Midna 
– if she was there, she would be the only one who could help me. The 
red lines made my feet sting and burn, my calves and shins were icy 
cold. <i>The lines were crawling up my legs!</i></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Powerful hands grabbed my shoulders 
and pushed me forward. The lines on my legs broke and I began running. 
The hands continued to stay behind my back, urging me on. I didn’t 
think to look behind me. The importance of leaving the encroaching lines 
behind was of utmost importance. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I touched the safety of the 
bridge, and the lines sank onto the ground. Hissing steam came up as 
the lines sank into the ground in piles. I took gasping breaths and 
finally thought to look at the one who saved me. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A furry, red haired, tiny, 
dollish looking creature floated at eye level. If it stood on the ground, 
it couldn’t have been more than three feet tall. “Who are you?” 
I asked hoarsely </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Midna,” the imp said. 
Her voice scraped my ears – even at low volume her voice sounded shrill 
and thin. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You call yourself Midna…?” 
I said, not understanding. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I<i> 
am</i> Midna!” She cried. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I stared at Midna with my mouth 
open. “What has happened to you?” I whispered. </font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“No time…Zant’s coming…you 
must be ready…get back to the throne room…” Midna’s words came 
out in an incoherent tumble. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“He…Zant…Zant’s coming 
to me? Why?” I said. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Zelda, I don’t have time,” 
she said. “You must stand firm. His desire is to make the Light Kingdom 
an extension of the Twilight. How can I make you understand – what 
am I not saying? His desire is to conquer Hyrule! Don’t surrender 
to him, whatever happens, please…please,” she said, head bowed. 
“Go…get out,” she said, and turned away. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My voice choked in my throat 
in protest as I stared at her back. <i>Was she abandoning me? No…it 
couldn’t be…</i> </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I left the depths of mind, 
haunted by her sobs. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I slipped out of my inner world 
and left my meditation room immediately. As soon as I emerged, I began 
calling orders; my home was soon to come under attack, and I would not 
stand by and see Zant’s Twilight blot out my sun. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In answer to my calls, guards 
snapped to attention, ran for the armory and distributed weaponry. The 
servants left their duties and I directed them to the underground basement 
that was built for such a time. I on the other hand, refused to go down 
with the majority of my household. Courage would be my armor, strength 
my shield and power of mind my weapon. I would stand with my soldiers 
and face the danger head on – I determined to fulfill my role as Regent 
Princess to the fullest. Would it be enough?</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I walked at the front of a 
retinue of my guards, and my lead general, Riekkan handed me my mother’s 
sword – a subtle work of beauty. Pearlescent, smooth, perfectly balanced. 
Deadly. It was forged with the ability to slide through an enemy’s 
heart like a knife through soft butter. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I walked with decisive steps 
into my throne room where I would soon meet this Zant. I would not come 
to him – he would come to me. I did not sit on the throne my father 
and I had so often played on as an adolescent. I stood on the front 
of the dais to receive the best view of the main entrance. Riekkan shouted 
positional orders to my soldiers, and I silently berated myself for 
not setting up doors to provide some measure of defense. It had always 
been tradition for the throne room to be free of doors – an indication 
that the Royal Family and the people whom they governed were never to 
be separated. ‘<i>Still</i>, I thought, <i>doors might have served 
as some barrier to invasions.”</i></font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When the marble floor under 
my feet began to shake, my mind shivered; I forced it to focus on the 
moment, focus on defense and an opportunity to attack. Plaster came 
down in tiny flakes from the ceiling and walls as the ground underneath 
my feet trembled. I looked to the doorway and what I saw almost caused 
me to my knees. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A fog – not unlike the fog 
that had been in on Midna’s mental plane – had risen and covered 
the entire doorway, black atmosphere edged with those same red lines. 
I tried to take control of my breathing, but when a blast of cold, foul 
air shrieked into the room, I forgot about any kind of control. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Monsters, <i>hideous</i> monsters 
charged at lightning speed into the room, grabbing up my soldiers as 
they hurtled. Riekkan gave the signal to charge to those who were still 
on the ground and I ground my teeth as those Twilit creatures grabbed 
up my soldiers one by one and broke their necks with sickening crunches. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Riekkan sent out another wave 
of troops, but I knew we were sending the men to their immediate deaths. 
I gave Riekkan the signal to stop attack and begin defense – there 
were only a few soldiers left, and it would have been meaningless to 
attack again. Nonetheless, I unsheathed my mother’s sword and white-knuckled 
it and focused on preparing for the next imminent attack. It was a maneuver 
made more to reassure myself more than it was preparation to tear into 
those monsters.  </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Suddenly, a deep darkness cast 
over the massive room and in the dimness I perceived something—a man 
or beast, I couldn’t tell—walking up to me, steps heavy and slow. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Realization hit. Visual details 
revealed. My mind turned white.  </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A steel helmet carved into 
the shape of a monster’s head with an oddly curved tongue sat on shoulders 
covered with thick, black cloth. Thin, blue, glowing trails decorated 
the cloak which It wore. Tassels hung from the sleeves where there should 
have been hands, and metallic boots heavily clanked up my carpet to 
the dais, leaving scores in the floor. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">After I stared at the marks 
in my floor, I noticed all my soldiers were gone. They were mercilessly 
killed and out of the way – they would not make resistance anymore. 
My only choice was to face this catastrophe head-on and with strength, 
but I felt more alone than I ever had in my life. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The creature, Zant, spoke in 
an guttural tone, “It is time for you to choose: surrender or die. 
Oh yes, a question for all the land and people of Hyrule... Life? Or 
death?!” The sound of his – or it’s – voice grated on my ears 
and made me want to cover them. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I spoke to block out the sound 
of his grotesque baritone, “Life or death for whom, Zant?” </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In the blink of an eye, Zant 
flew into my face and screamed, “I am <i>King </i>
Zant!” His boots smashed up onto the dais on which I was standing, 
dislodging tiles. I swung my sword at his helmet and he took three steps 
back. “I do not recognize you as <i>king</i>!” I cried. “You are 
a usurper and you will never be a true ruler. Your power is worthless 
and has been handed to you for a short time. Consider your days numbered.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I stared at his helmet for 
a few brief moments. I could only assume that he was looking at me through 
those bulbous metal eyes. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“My question Zant. Answer 
my question!” I softly demanded. If I had allowed fear to leak into 
my voice, I would have been decimated. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">He spoke again, this time with 
more peevishness than before. “If you surrender, life for you and 
your people. If you fight, death for you,” he said. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I aimed my sword between the 
eyes of the helmet. “If I fought you and met my death, what would 
become of my people?” I asked. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“They would die soon after 
you,” came his answer. “Be sure of it.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I have told my husband time 
and time again – I would rather be burned alive than have my citizens’ 
blood on my head. I made my decision and didn’t think twice. Choosing 
surrender, I dropped my mother’s sword. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Then so be it,” I said. </font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It was in this way that I signed 
my name on the darkness that spread across Hyrule. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My watch on Zant’s helmet 
broke as I looked at something floating in the corner of my eye. A slender, 
black, squarish object spun slowly up towards the ceiling, and was followed 
by hundreds more – more and more all around the room. The Light that 
I had taken for granted all my life was extinguished, and everything 
I saw was drenched in a hazy, yellow-brown miasma. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zant took advantage of my distraction, 
walked up to my person and leaned into my face. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zant turned and lifted his 
head to the high ceiling. He spoke with reverence. “Our new Twilight 
Princess has taken <i>her </i>place...” To whom he was speaking, I 
did not know. An entity? What righteous entity would bless the coup 
of a righteous kingdom?</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zant faced me. I stared at 
the helmet until he raised his arm and swooped it over my head. I ducked 
to avoid being smashed in the face and I hit something hard. It wasn’t 
until I opened my eyes that I suddenly realized I was in my bedroom. 
“Stay there…until my god and I have need of you.” Zant’s voice 
echoed ominously in my ears. The door locked behind me, but I ignored 
it.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My brain raved with questions. 
‘<i>God? What god?</i></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>‘Is this the same 
“god” that was created by the pre-Twili race? </i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Is Zant searching for Midna’ 
s piece of the Fused Shadows? Does he have the other pieces? If he 
gains all the broken parts of the Fused Shadow, what will happen? 
How much more powerful will he become? Will this Twilight in my Lighted 
world be permanent? What then would it take to save us from Twilight 
and Zant? Could we even be saved? Is Hyrule being punished for her sins 
against the Goddesses? Do they punish by sending evil usurpers?” </i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I needed to do something to 
keep myself from going mad, and went to the window to watch the town 
market. What I saw made me want to weep - Twilight covered the marketplace 
and my people were slowly being engulfed. In their places, blue tongues 
of fire lit and their physical forms could no longer be seen. It appeared 
that the people were dying and their souls wandering the earth, full 
of resentment and desire to return to their ordinary lives. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I turned away from that sight 
which both horrified and condemned me.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A fierce, cold draft came through 
my room. There wasn’t a way I could light a fire in the hearth – 
Zant and his minions wouldn’t give me anything that could be turned 
into a weapon. Needing warmth and comfort, I went to the wardrobe in 
the corner and pulled out a long, black cloak. It had been created long 
ago for stealth by the Sheikah remnant, but it kept the draft from reaching 
my skin, but the thick clock did not seem to be enough. I pulled out 
a scarf – a gift from foreign dignitaries of the desert. Made from 
a deep purple, silken material, it was perfect for my face and neck. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Thoughts whirled again: <i>
I have just lost my kingdom to one of the most evil and power-thirsty 
usurper kings in Hyrule’s history 
and I’m here thinking about clothing. Midna had told me not to surrender, 
but I wasn’t left with much of a choice. 
 </i></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I half-heartedly called Midna’s 
name and was overjoyed to see her rolling out of the unlit fireplace. 
It quickly became clear that she did not reciprocate the feeling of 
joy, in fact, she was furious. She dug her sharp fingernails into my 
neck and shook my head with all her strength.  </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I told you, I told you, 
I told you, NOT to surrender! What have you done?!” She howled. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In a violent burst of anger, 
I threw her across the room onto the bed. “And did you do any differently 
when Zant came to you for your surrender?!” I screamed back at her. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna again flew into my face. 
“I didn’t surrender, you empty-headed naïve bitch! I was thrown 
out!” She shrieked. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My hand surged and I slapped 
her hard across the face. We stood staring at each other on opposite 
sides of the room, both of us panting in fury. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna stared at me with a long 
spectrum of blinding wrath, deep understanding and infinite love. My 
anger broke and I began to shake with the expended effort of keeping 
up my end of the fight. I slowly sank into the nearest chair – the 
shame on my face was evident, I’m sure. Stunned at the bestiality 
of my behavior, I could not look into Midna’s eyes. I pulled the hood 
of the cloak over my head and looked away.  </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My hand rested on the arm of 
the chair and I felt Midna sit on my arm. I didn’t make the effort 
to move, I simply cried. The day had been too much for me to handle. 
I failed my father, I failed Midna, I failed my ancestors, I failed 
the gods, I failed <i>my country</i>. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Midna, you need to leave 
before you are caught,” I managed to choke out. “I’ve already 
ruined your plans for keeping the Twilight out. I’ve shattered your 
intentions to receive your crown again. I won’t have you caught. It 
would make things worse than they already are.” </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna moved from my hand into 
my lap. For her height, she was certainly heavy. She pushed her hands 
into the hood of my cloak and gently brushed it aside, then leaned forward 
and kissed my lips. I only cried, “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry…You 
told me not to surrender and I did,” I said. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Yes,” she answered simply, 
with no hint of malice or anger. “My words were not to surrender. 
But now we move on from here,” she said firmly. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I must find our Hero Beast 
– our hour of need is more urgent than ever,” she said. “Zelda, 
I would take you out of here in a moment if we didn’t both know that 
would allow Zant to track us down. I must ask you to stay and be our 
Twilight Princess until I return.” </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Yes,” I said quietly. 
It was the only thing to do. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Also, we cannot allow anyone 
to know about…us. I’m petrified of Zant’s discovering it and using 
you to twist my arm into something horrible. Please understand, Rose-elda.” 
She murmured, kissing my tears away. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I held her as close as I could 
to my breast for as long as she would let me. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">After listening to our breaths 
move slowly in and out of synchronization, I said, “You must go.” </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna nodded. “Please stay 
strong until I return,” she said. “And I <i>will</i> return.” </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Strength will be my shield,” 
I answered. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She smiled a genuine smile 
and prepared to leave. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Zelda,” she whispered. 
“Watch me.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I lifted my head and she rose 
to the window. My mouth dropped as her body was split into hundred of 
tiny pieces and the pieces floated <i>through</i> the window. My mouth 
dropped further as the bits assembled again together to create Midna’s 
body again. I could hear her laughter through the window. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Like it?!” She shouted 
through the window, and I came up and touched the cold glass pane. I 
smiled when she kissed the window, pressing her lips against it. </font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She waved and I watched until 
the last of her shards absorbed into the air. There wasn’t anything 
to do after that beyond watching out the window and listening for anyone 
coming up to see me. I went to bed for what proved to be a fitful sleep. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Indeed, the days crawled on. 
Zant’s endless cycles of guards assigned to my tower were hardly a 
source of entertainment. I had nothing with which to occupy myself; 
I wasn’t given any paper or ink, nothing with which to conduct research, 
and certainly no weapons to practice with. It became my experience that 
with the routine of boredom came also deep worries that would not have 
bothered me otherwise. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Will the crops grow with 
Twilight on our land? If they do not, what will become of my people? 
Will they be forced to leave Hyrule, become immigrants of another world? 
What will happen to our population if they are forced to leave in droves? 
Our economy would crash, our military would be nothing to speak of, 
and the national damage would be next to impossible to reverse. </i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Where is my mother’s sword? 
Where has it gone…How can I make the Arrows…The Arrows!…My power 
– what little power I have – is nothing in the face of Twilight…and 
Zant…and his “god”…Who will save my country…Midna by herself 
is not strong enough…and together, she and I are still nothing…Where 
is she?...Why am I here…Why was I born 
for this time…</i></font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Tedious inertia set in, my 
mind slowly being sabotaged. I kept my mind busy from childhood, and 
in captivity, there remained nothing to do. My worries ate my mind alive 
– viewing the marketplace in my window did nothing to ease my mental 
anguish. I never saw human faces, only blue tongues of flame and yet 
the sneaking assurance that my people <i>were</i> in fact alive and 
just imperceptible to the naked human eye gave me a small amount of 
encouragement. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">One day, I began pacing and 
over just a few moments, the pressure on my mind became too much. My 
hands shook and I longed to grab hold of something and break or bend 
it with all my might. My thoughts were a ridiculous mess – really, 
they couldn’t be imagined as thoughts at all; just utter chaos. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">At the point where my brain 
could take no more, I separated my spirit from my body, rose out from 
the room, through the ceiling and the roof, reached the outside and 
breathed the Twilit air. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It was an ability I had practiced 
for years, but I did not need it until that moment. There wasn’t any 
way that I could have taken any more mental torture – something had 
to cave in or else I would have lost my mind. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I allowed my spirit to float 
high and I looked down at my home, now Zant’s headquarters. I observed 
it from an aerial view, and I realized how insignificant it was in the 
face of the horrors that had befallen it – and what was I?</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I looked up to the skies, folded 
my hands in supplication and prayed, “Goddesses, hear your servant 
– please, I ask of something from You. Send the one who is to be our 
Hero. Our need only increases with each passing hour. I will sacrifice 
everything I have if You awaken him to our need.” Deep in my heart, 
I felt they heard me. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Everything?</i> </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I will sacrifice everything 
I have, even my life,” I said and I meant it. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>With freedom comes sacrifice, 
Zelda, and sacrifice could come at a 
great price. Everything?</i></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Yes…everything,” I said. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I became concerned that Zant’s 
servants would find my body in the room in its deathlike state, so I 
sank and continued to sink until I was settled back into my physical 
person. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">One day after several days 
of not knowing her whereabouts, Midna returned. The door was opened 
slightly to allow for air circulation but only achieved in letting in 
drafts. As I paced up and down the middle of my room, I swore loudly 
that whoever had thought that it appropriate to let the door open would 
be the first to have their heads taken off when I regained the throne.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I heard her murmuring on the 
staircase, but when Midna pushed through the door, I was shocked to 
see her riding what appeared to be a common timber wolf. My first reaction 
was amazement at how she had tamed it.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As they walked up to him, Midna 
proudly announced, “I found him!” </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It’s him…truly him?” 
I asked. “Your Hero Beast?” I looked at him carefully and started, 
realizing how blue eyes the creature had. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Hmmmm….”she murmured 
with a strange look. “Admiring my new slave, Princess? Isn’t he 
handsome?” Midna bragged, reaching behind her to pinch the wolf’s 
rump. The wolf twitched and growled at her as she gleefully kicked her 
heels against his sides. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Not a slave, Midna,” I 
said. “Not a slave.” This wolf – was he the Hero sent from the 
Goddesses?</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna ignored my statement. 
“Poor thing, he has no idea where this is or what&#39;s happened...” 
Midna sang as she tugged on his silky ears. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Why doesn’t he know? </i>
My mind asked. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“So, don&#39;t you think you 
should explain to him what you&#39;ve managed to do? You owe him that much...</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">...Twilight Princess!”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Ah. So she hasn’t 
completely forgiven me yet.</i> </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I didn’t know yet if the 
wolf had a human mind that could understand my story, but I related 
it all to him. Hardly had I finished before we heard Zant’s guard 
stomping up the staircase – to discover the source of the noise we 
were creating, no doubt. “Please go,” I told Midna and the wolf. 
“The guard is making his rounds and I wouldn’t want you to be caught.” </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna heard as well, and didn’t 
waste any time in tugging on the wolf’s ears to show him which direction 
he was supposed to go. They dashed out the door and I heard Midna call 
softly, “His name is Link.” </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Link. </i>

The Hero chosen by the Goddesses. The name given to all the Heroes whose 
destiny it is to save Hyrule from damnation. My mind spun – the legend 
was made flesh in Link. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">They must have made it safely 
out, because the guard glanced into my room and then sauntered back 
down the stairs, bored. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My prayers were solely for 
Midna and Link from that day onward; I prayed that they would never 
be captured in their quest to bring Zant down. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I held my own counsel in my 
heart about Link, and turned back to watch the rain fall through the 
window. I noticed that it had stopped, and somewhere, something deep 
in my heart rejoiced. <i>My prayers 
are being answered. </i></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I counted the months that passed 
by my woman’s cycles. One month gone, two months, three months, four. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Little changed inside my walls, 
but outside them, Hyrule’s future shifted always. The future rested 
on Link and Midna, but the importance of their – our – mission did 
not sink in until after the final mental conversation Midna and I had. 
It started in the regular manner – Midna’s account of her’s and 
Link’s cross-country adventures and skirmishes. The discussion suddenly 
took a strange turn. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Do you know what I am, fair 
Rose-elda?” She asked that morning. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Yes, you are the ruler of 
the people of Twilight,” I answered. “But sometimes, I don’t think 
I know what you are about – not completely.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Her answer was cryptic, to 
say the least. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“The Ruler of Twilight…The 
Ruler of Light…and the Mirror of Twilight will separate them forever.”</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I understood the phrases well 
enough. But the name ‘Mirror of Twilight’ shook my brain to the 
core.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Yes, Zelda. The Mirror of 
Twilight is seldom mentioned, and never lightly,” Midna said.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I understand you,” I spoke 
across our bridge. “It was a device created by the Sages to banish 
only the worst criminals in Hyrule’s history – those who attempted 
to break into the Sacred Realm and claim The Triangles for their own. 
But how does this relate to your original question?” I asked.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Her sigh was shaky. I longed 
to reach out, embrace her and absorb her warmth.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I am a descendant of the 
tribe that almost broke into your Sacred Realm,” she said.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Terrible as it sounds, I was 
not surprised. “I guessed as much –“ I started.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna interrupted, “Your 
ancestors banned mine to the Twilight World.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My face flushed. “The ancient 
Sages were my tutors, they never told –“</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“They wouldn’t,” Midna 
said bitterly. “They’re too consumed with their own self-righteousness 
to truly care about what they were doing, and they will not start by 
feeling sorry for us – my people – now.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Stunned, I could not speak. 
I was looking into a part of Midna I had never seen before. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna turned her back on me.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“We are an evolved race – 
we are no longer a corrupt, greedy people. We seek peace and harmony 
with one another, and yet your Sages see fit to continue to punish us. 
Zant’s insanity seems to be the strongest indication.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I leapt in. “How is Zant’s 
mental implosion the Sages fault?” I asked.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Zant would not have felt 
the need to dethrone me if he hadn’t been feeling pressure from somewhere,” 
she said. “I can only assume that it is the result of your Sage’s 
continued punishment.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She left then, without another 
word. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Wait!” I cried. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna did not answer or return 
to me that night.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It was a long time before she 
spoke again on our mental planes, but she did meet again. If she continued 
to be bitter, or even remember our conversation, she did not make it 
apparent. To fill the silent voids that sometimes stretched between 
us, she rambled about her adventures and Link’s achievements. When 
Midna began speaking of Link more often than she did not, I wondered 
if their relationship had begun to progress beyond the slave-Mistress 
relationship. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Well into the fifth month after 
I had seen them last, I slipped into my subconscious to have my daily 
conversation with Midna. Except, there was no longer a way for me to 
reach her…our bridge had been irreparably splintered. Panic rose. <i>
How would I reach Midna</i>? <i>Was she even aware that it was broken?</i></font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My frenzy grew for over an 
hour. It broke only when I heard the heavy pant of an approaching animal. 
I hoped that it was Link and Midna, but if it wasn’t? I didn’t have 
much time to wonder. The wolf with blue eyes, Link, squeezed through. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">However, I had eyes only for 
Midna. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She lay on his back, limp and 
powerless.<i> </i>Something or someone had tried to kill her and failed, 
but it was obvious she was fatally injured. Her coloring looked bad 
and her hoarse breathing alarmed my heart. It would soon be difficult 
for her to gather air. When she began to drop off the wolf, I dove forward 
and caught her.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My eyes would have filled with 
tears if my hot desire to keep her face in focus for as long as possible 
wasn’t so strong. I held her to my breast as she spoke through her 
labored breathing. “Please... Please tell me... How do we break...the 
curse on this one? This...is the one... You need him...to save your 
world! That&#39;s why... Princess... Please... You must help Link...”</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I cannot say how much I wanted 
to weep and scream while she spoke. I had to keep calm – any extreme 
emotions I felt she would be able to sense and those would only serve 
to worsen her condition. As I held her to my face, Midna tangled a weak 
hand in my hair and whispered strange, convoluted phrases I couldn’t 
understand – perhaps she was praying then? </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“<i>You must help Link</i>.” 
Her last plea echoed in my mind. I observed Midna’s breathing and 
coloration for a little while more. And then…</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">…<i>soul separation</i>. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">…what I had been practicing 
for years. The act of parting the soul from the body while the body 
still lived. But as I watched Midna die, I understood that more than 
just separation of the body and soul was required – I would have to 
give up the life of my body if Midna was to live. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>This…this was the sacrifice 
the Goddesses had called me to make. This was how I was to help Link. 
And Midna. </i>My mind coiled in preparation. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I softly addressed the woman 
I loved in my arms, “You are our last hope and you act in my stead. 
I cannot let you die, so please accept this.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Slowly, I let go of the threads 
of my life, my heart, my soul, my power. My physical senses dulled, 
a buzzing in my ears began, and my vision began to snow. I felt physical 
strength drain from me, my breathing turned shallow, and the magic that 
once blazed through my veins cooled. Simultaneously, Midna’s color 
began to return, and her own breathing waxed strong. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The transition between our 
bodies was almost finished when Midna shouted, “Princess NO! Link 
stop her!” Link only stood gaping. She should have known that it was 
too late. The life in my body was gone – it was Midna’s. My spirit 
stood in her – my physical body was dead. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The Goddesses asked me if I 
was willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of Hyrule, and I said 
yes. It was not physically painful, however, it was spiritually painful. 
Memories of my mother, my father, my tutors the Sages, everyone I had 
loved slipped away from me. My mind was weak, submissive and would be 
ruled by Midna’s. Her memories would become mine, her thoughts and 
my thoughts would be the same. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I wouldn’t have had it any 
other way. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Hours felt like days and days 
felt like years. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Everything Midna and Link worked 
for I witnessed through her eyes. My anger grew with Midna’s when 
we saw my home quickly enclosed in an evil atmosphere after we had left 
my home. I rejoiced when the ancient Master Sword was withdrawn and 
Link restored to his human form. Inside and alongside Midna, I fought 
the creatures that tried to stop our progress. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">During the rare times we rested, 
I watched with Midna while Link – our Hero – slept. He had a monstrous 
snore that consistently kept Midna awake, hence the reason why she was 
often the night watch. To keep him more quiet, poor Midna would roll 
Link onto his side, his back, and his stomach but it seldom mended his 
snoring. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Link was also quite the eater 
and often picked for himself strange fruits and vegetables out of the 
fields of Hyrule without examining them too closely. Once, in his hunger, 
Link ate a poisonous fruit – Midna was forced to create for the foolish 
boy a combination of water and salt to make him bring it back up. In 
his panic, Link did not think to ingest salted water to help himself, 
but in the end, he proved to be grateful. I’ve never laughed so hard 
in my life as when Midna screamed a long string of profanities while 
Link vomited terribly. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">He was foolish in some things, 
but certainly not in most things. Link had the ability to dispatch a 
group of enemies in very quickly and many times he emerged from a one-on-one 
fight with nary a scratch – if he did, it was negligible. I felt Midna’s 
admiration for him, and it seemed to me that there were feelings developing 
between the two of them. I was confused though – were those Midna’s 
feelings, or were they mine? Were they coming from both our hearts? 
Nonetheless, I couldn’t help but feel pride in how mine and Midna’s 
hearts had melted into one, how her thoughts were indistinguishable 
from mine. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But there was not a way to 
prepare for the discovery of Zant’s god, the one he had mentioned 
just before he caged me in my room.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We on the site of the Arbiter’s 
Grounds, the home of the Sages’ spirits and the old dungeons of judgment. 
It was a question we had to ask but it was an answer we weren’t anticipating. 
“Ganondorf,” said the Sages. It was the only word needed, the name 
that evoked terror and chaos. I felt Midna’s limbs slacken and her 
spine bend in despair.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You&#39;re just now figuring 
out where Zant got his power?” Howled Midna. “It&#39;s far too late!”</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The scourge of Hyrule, the 
dark angel fighting against the Goddesses’ hand of fate for centuries 
had become strong through Zant, and quickly becoming more powerful than 
before. Without a doubt, Ganondorf could eventually become impervious 
to any attack made by a mortal.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">After nearly half a year journeying 
to find the shards of the Twilight Mirror, we returned to my home, the 
House of the Royals. Midna and I understood then why the evil barrier 
had been created. Ganondorf had no intention of allowing anyone but 
Link and Midna in – he had created a trap, using my body as bait to 
lure them in. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">After months of hard work, 
Midna was in full possession of the Fused Shadow, the ancient god-object 
the pre-Twili race created after shunning the Goddesses. Midna awakened 
the power inside and almost instantly, she was transformed into a monstrous 
creature, armed with a frightening spear. With a stab that could shatter 
anything, she broke the evil barrier. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She had tremendous power, but 
I remember the horror that she felt when we discovered what had once 
been home to my soul in that cavernous throne room. Ganondorf had my 
body within his physical grasp. We didn’t know what he would do with 
it – we were not even aware of what he <i>could</i> do.   </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“So you&#39;re Ganondorf,” 
said Midna. “I&#39;ve been dying to meet you.” The cool tone of her 
voice belied the fury I felt rising in her heart. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Your people have long amused 
me, Midna. To defy the gods with such petty magic, only to be cast aside...how 
very pathetic,” the dark demon said.  “Pathetic as they were, though, 
they served me well. Their anguish was my nourishment. Their hatred 
bled across the void and awakened me. I drew deep of it and grew strong 
again. Your people had some skill, to be sure...but they lacked true 
power. The kind of absolute power that those chosen by the gods wield. 
He who wields such power would make a suitable king for this world, 
don&#39;t you think?”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna became speechless with 
anger. “Conceited bastard!” She screamed. Did Ganondorf understand 
the chords struck within Midna’s heart? And mine? He must have – 
his first act of violence proved it. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">He gained control over my soulless 
body and used it to attack Link and Midna. I remember Midna’s cries 
when Ganondorf’s spirit filled my body to the breaking point. I understand 
now that the threads between her heart and mine communicated pain. My 
body was still alive to a certain point and Ganondorf’s possession 
hurt us both. It was almost too much to bear – my mind shrieked with 
the strain. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Link did everything he could 
to fight Ganondorf but leave my body somewhat unharmed. The attacks 
that Ganondorf used my body to create were nothing short of appalling. 
The boy to whom Midna’s heart had warmed parried and blocked, but 
never directly attacked my body. I remember feeling that first, small 
sense of pride in him and Midna smiled in the mental connection we had. 
“We needed him after all, didn’t we, Rose-elda?” My spirit wept 
with pain, but it also wept with joy at the sound of <i>Rose-elda</i>, 
the special name I hadn’t heard in a long time.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i> </i>
“It seems we did,” my mind answered. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">At last, Link weakened Ganondorf 
and Midna took the chance to summon the Fused Shadows and rip him out 
of my body.  </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">With the absence of evil inside 
the body, I could inhabit it once more and I cannot express what it 
felt like to be <i>home </i>after nearly a year of being away from it. 
When I opened my own eyes once again, Midna was hovering inches above 
me. “Princess…” she choked. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Middie…” I whispered. 
Words were not needed. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I heard softly shuffling feet 
and I looked around Midna to see Link, shyly smiling at me. As we held 
each others’ gaze, I wryly thought that he was far more handsome in 
person. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“How does it feel to be back?” 
Link asked, blushing as he spoke. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I was struck then at his age. 
He couldn’t have been more than eighteen years old – and yet he 
used all his strength to help to topple the most evil regime Hyrule 
has ever known. Would that every person made the choice for such sacrifice 
for the greater good!</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“It feels….,” my voice 
scratched uncomfortably from months of unuse. “Just right.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">He grinned at me and I couldn’t 
help but smile back. The dimples in his cheeks were…darling, for lack 
of a better word. When I gazed at his eyes, I saw none of the terrors, 
pain from battles, months of hard work, months of sleeping on hard ground 
in the open air. I only saw excitement, joy…and love?</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I’m so happy you’re 
back, Your Majesty,” he said, bowing. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I watched his every muscle 
move. He was, in one word, beautiful. My words came automatically, my 
heart giving meaning to them. “It is an honor and a delight to be 
back, Link,” I said. “I am in debt for your protection and-“   </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Our interaction was cut short 
by a crackling in the air, and the distinct smell of evil. Ganondorf 
appeared in his spirit form, ready to fight all over again.  </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna growled. “What?! Again? 
The son of a bitch!”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I stood up unsteadily and began 
to muster up a shield of protection around us, but it was clear to me 
that it wouldn’t be remotely enough. Link drew his sword, but can 
a sword cut through spirit? While Link and I were busy with out battle 
preparations, behind my back, Midna prepared one of the Twili warp points 
above mine and Link’s heads. I heard the sound of the point crackling 
and looked above just in time to be physically removed from the room. 
In my last glance at her, I watched her assemble the broken pieces of 
the Fused Shadow with a serene smile on her face, her face turned to 
the sky beyond the ceiling. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In the next blink of my eyes, 
I stood on the wide open fields of Hyrule. The sky had an ugly, pallor 
to it – ominous gray and yellow. I heard hard panting and looked to 
my side to see Link standing beside me, just as horrified as I. “She 
took you out with me, Link?” I cried.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">He nodded in disbelief, his 
eyes darting about. I drew close to him and saw tears forming in his 
eyes. It suddenly occurred to me with a hard shock that Midna might 
have been in love with the warrior boy, and he with her. I took a deep 
breath and looked away from him as the thought blared in my mind. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A loud crash deafened me, and 
a small running distance away, Ganondorf sat on his great black horse. 
He raised his arm high above his head, and I saw something in his hand 
but could not make out what it was. That is, until he snapped its spire 
and dropped it. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My heart crunched with Midna’s 
Fused Shadow piece – Ganondorf was the victor. Anger flared into deep 
rancor and I screamed a battle challenge at the evil man. His only response 
was a rude gesture.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I began breathing deeply, focusing 
my attentions on the battle just starting. Link drew his sword and steeled 
himself for the oncoming battle, but I stilled his hand and our eyes 
met in understanding. There was only one way this battle could be won. 
I prayed for the good spirits of this world to intervene on our behalf.. 
“Spirits of the light! Wielders of the great power that shines far 
and wide upon the lands of our world...In my hour of need, grant me 
the light to banish evil!” </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The Spirits granted my prayer 
and their power surged through me. I felt strength seeping into my limbs 
and mind as the energy seared my veins. Light and took the opportunity 
to touch Link in his mind, making a bridge between us, just like Midna 
had done so long ago with me. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I looked into his eyes and 
waited until his wonder ceased so he could look at me – and not just <i>
at</i> me but <i>into </i>me. When his eyes finally met mine, he smiled 
a foolish smile and blushed furiously despite the situation. “Link,” 
I said. “Would you grant us the last of your power?” The battle 
we were about to face was far bigger than any sense of royal superiority 
I could have felt, so I bowed to him, waiting for his answer, waiting 
for either <i>yes </i>or <i>no</i>. I wouldn’t be able to kill Ganondorf 
without Link – I knew I wouldn’t. Nevertheless, I wanted the choice 
to be Link’s</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I felt him slide his hand into 
mine and my heart quivered with anticipation. I will,” he said with 
a confident smile. I raised my head and our gazes met. I think we both 
felt it then – we had a bond that could never be broken, even beyond 
death. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The battle began. Link wielded 
his sword, I, my mother’s bow and the Spirit’s Arrows of Light. 
We fought to bring Ganondorf down together, and Link gradually wore 
the Dark King down enough to plant the ancient Master Sword squarely 
into Ganondorf’s black heart. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">All done. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I ran to Link to praise him, 
to embrace him, to kiss him even, but I paused when I realized Link’s 
eyes were filled with tears. There was one who could not share in our 
joy – one whose victory was as much as hers as it was ours, but had 
thrown herself in the path of immediate death to save her lover and 
friends. But Link loved Midna as I had. The slightest pang of jealousy 
pricked my heart. <i>Midna has always been mine. Whose is she now that 
she has gone to the Plane of the Immortals?</i></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But I could feel no true grief 
and could not explain why. I knew the sadness was there, but it did 
not manifest itself in the same way that it had with the death of my 
father. I had expected blinding pain from the heart, dizzying mental 
anguish. Where was it? Had I become too callused?</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I regarded Link and the envy 
rose again. I mentally slapped myself for being so selfish. The boy 
had spent more time with her than I had, how could he <i>not</i> have 
loved her in some fashion? And I couldn’t exactly say that I have 
some sort of feeling for Link either. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Even as our victory rose in 
front of us, confusion and a double feeling in my heart grew. I knew 
I loved Midna - that much was certain - but I was also aware of a tenderness 
that could grow into love for Link. The feeling of liking someone of 
the opposite sex was strange and new, and not just a little thrilling. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As memories of times with Midna 
flickered before my mind’s eye, finally, my heart clenched and cried. <i>
How could she die?</i> I never even considered that she could – in 
my youthful naivety, that possibility never occurred to me. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>You are not the only person 
who grieves.</i> I heard Link’s quiet sobs and without thinking, I 
touched his shoulder. He almost didn’t notice, but then when he registered 
my touch, he looked at me…with that look of love again. It <i>was </i>
love! My heart caught in my throat when I at last understood. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I heard voices many leagues 
away from where we were standing and turned towards them. The Light 
Spirits were assembling. I thought at first that they were holding some 
kind of council in regards to Ganondorf’s death, but when they evaporated, 
I saw a small figure sitting on the ground in their places. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I sent Link up the hill to 
see what they had done, but before he reached the top, my heart told 
me what he would find – Midna, in her true, resurrected person. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As we three held our private 
celebrations and watched the people of Hyrule hold their ruckus festivals, 
I observed Link and Midna’s interactions. The boy was quite enamored 
with her – that much was obvious. He constantly made puppy eyes at 
her and it was times like those that I felt jealousy for both of them, 
Midna in particular. I understood that Midna was, at the least, very 
attached to Link – she probably loved him. I also knew that tenderness 
for Link resided in my heart and it was my suspicion that Link returned 
the feelings. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I contemplated our situation 
at my dining table in my private quarters adjacent to a small but airy 
green garden. ‘A sordid, twisted love triangle we’re in,’ I thought 
to myself.  </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There was a part of me that 
wanted Link, to feel a kiss from his mouth, to feel his hand touch mine, 
to hear him whisper in my ear. However, there was a bigger part of me 
that wanted Midna – I longed to feel her hands on my breasts and the 
apex between my thighs, longed to kiss her soft neck, longed to feel 
our hips touch one another. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I did not eat much at that 
particular supper. Link ate as though he hadn’t eaten in months. The 
sight of him stuffing meats, breads, fruits, and fresh vegetables into 
his mouth reminded me at once of the game my father and I used to play 
– “Court Jester Parade.” I remembered all the fat suitors shoveling 
food into their mouths, taking advantage of the free food courtesy of 
the Royal Family. Link had better table manners than they had, but I 
couldn’t believe the sheer volume of food he managed to stomach. </font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The thought of my father and 
our games brought tears to my eyes. My heart ached for him, it ached 
for Midna’s eternal embrace, it ached for a moment alone with Link. 
I think now that the aching was a result of the “high mountaintop” 
that I was coming down from. The emotional high of defeating Ganondorf 
combined with the memories of the small battles leading to his death 
was enough to make me thoroughly insane. Midna looked directly at me 
as and she seemed to understand what was happening. She politely excused 
ourselves from Link’s company and went into my garden. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I still love you,” she 
said before we had reached the shadows of a grove of orange trees.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“But you love him back,” 
I countered.  </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna sighed and watched a 
bird scuffle about in the leaves. “Love is more complicated than I’d 
ever imagined. I loved you the same moment I first laid eyes on you. 
And yet…with Link…you grow close with those whom a year of your 
life is spent.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The part of me that loved Midna 
despaired. “What can I do to win you back?” I said. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“When you died for me…you 
had my heart for all eternity,” Midna whispered with emotion in her 
voice. “I don’t know of a pure soul in the world who wouldn’t 
appreciate such a sacrifice, but I will always love the woman who died 
so I could live.” </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She held me and kissed me, 
holding me firmly. “I love you, my Rose-elda.” </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I love you, too,” I cried. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I kissed her again and when 
we broke apart, I smiled through the tears in my eyes and hugged her 
tightly. As we walked back to join Link, she said something rather random. 
“You will be expected to marry. Your kingdom will need the security 
of future heirs.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Will you marry me?” I 
asked, half teasing and half serious. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I wish that were possible,” 
Midna murmured. “I believe that your people will pressure you to marry 
our dear hero.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“But…he loves you…doesn’t 
he?” I said. Midna grunted. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“He loves me as a seventeen 
year—old can. He will grow up, and while he won’t forget me, he 
will soon desire a wife,” she said. “I’ve seen how he looks at 
you. When your people see that he has tenderness for you, Link will 
be their natural choice.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You said he was raised on 
a farm. How on earth can a farm boy be suitable for kingship?” I asked, 
trying to stall for time. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You must be joking, Zelda 
– he was indeed raised on a farm, but he was chosen by the Goddesses 
to save your kingdom and mine. What better husband can you find other 
than him? He would be <i>more </i>than suitable for the office of King. 
Your deities, nor mine, would choose an unworthy hero. If he does not 
want to a leader in that regard, you could be sole ruler and he would 
be your consort,” Midna said.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“He is too young to be a 
husband,” I said, attempting to stall for more time. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Young – yes. But give 
him a year yet,” she said. “I anticipate your being excellent for 
one another. He needs someone who is matched according to his strength 
and power and you need someone to be your shield as you fight the battles 
of life. You truly are naturally made for one another.” </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“And we were not made for 
each other?” I asked. Midna was silent.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I was stunned at Midna’s 
match-making, but I gave up trying to evade the issue at hand. “I’ve 
never loved anyone but you. How can I love a man?” I asked. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I should have never trained 
you up to the ways of women lovers,” Midna shook her head. “I have 
caused more trouble than I imagined.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I turned her face to me and 
held it. “You have not – and will never cause any trouble - through 
you, I have learned to love. And you did not train me,” I said. “I 
came into the world prepared to be the lover of one woman and one woman 
only. I only needed your awakening to realize it. You came to me at 
a time when I despaired of feeling again, and I will be eternally grateful 
for the Goddesses’ gift they sent to me,” I said passionately. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">For the first time, I saw tears 
coming up into Midna’s eyes. My heart reached for hers and we met 
on the bridge in our minds. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I will…always…love you,” 
I said. Midna wept.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We joined Link at the dinner 
table shortly thereafter. Midna and I both worked to control our emotions 
and Link watched us both carefully, nibbling on a piece of cheese. He 
looked to Midna, looked to me, then spoke quietly. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“How do you fare, my Lady?” 
He asked. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I’m well, Link, thank 
you,” I said. He was not completely at ease around me at the time, 
but I wondered about the truthfulness of Midna’s predictions in regards 
to Link and I marrying one day. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">That evening, Midna eventually 
said that which I dreaded to hear. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“As my dear friends know 
well, I cannot stay here. I must return to the Twilight Realm and take 
control of my kingdom once more,” she stated. I said nothing, but 
Link’s mouth dropped open. Apparently, the notion hadn’t occurred 
to him.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna and I made the best of 
our last days together. We walked through the sprawling fields of Hyrule 
and swam together in my favorite lakes. Under the cover of night, Midna 
slipped into my bedroom from hers and we made love with urgency and 
a poignancy that had not been present before. Once, during a warm, springtime 
rainstorm, she dragged me out of bed and into my secluded garden and 
made love to me there with a power I had never seen before. I remember 
how I touched her lips, her neck, her breasts and her center with my 
tongue, willing my senses to imprint her scent and the sensation of <i>
her</i> forever in my heart.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Many times, we took short walking 
tours through Hyrule and made those short walks last as long as we could. 
We never had a retinue with us; it would have been an invasion on sacred 
moments. Often, Link accompanied us on our excursions and Midna tried 
to help Link acclimate to my presence. Her diligence succeeded, and 
eventually Link and I came onto equal ground and we talked with more 
familiarity. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It was too short a time with 
Midna. We left for the portal to Midna’s home, the Mirror Chamber, 
four weeks after the fall of Ganondorf. My Middie, while loathe to leave 
us, understood that her people needed her to provide stability once 
again. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In the last hour, Midna stood 
tall and proud on the glowing platform that would soon take her home, 
and spoke her last words to us. “Well...I guess this is farewell, 
huh? Light and shadow can&#39;t mix, as we all know. But...never forget 
that there&#39;s another world bound to this one.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Shadow and light are two 
sides of the same coin,” I said. “One cannot exist without the other. 
I know now the reason the goddesses left the Mirror of Twilight in this 
world. They left it because it was their design that we should meet. 
Yes...That is what I believe.” I tried to call on the emotional control 
that I had been trained as a royal to have, but I didn’t quite succeed. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Zelda,” she said softly. 
“Your words are kind, and your heart is true. If all in Hyrule are 
like you…Then maybe you&#39;ll do all right. Thank you...”</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>No, Middie. Thank you. </i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She walked onto the platform 
that presented her to the Mirror, and turned to us again. It appeared 
as though she was trying to say one last word to us, but only a single 
tear to emerged from her eyes. As I watched, she pushed the tear towards 
the mirror. I remember wondering briefly why she did it. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I understood a moment later. 
The Mirror began cracking with the contact from the tear. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Link and I whirled about to 
watch its splitting and Link looked as though he wanted to run and grab 
Midna off the platform. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But I knew this was way of 
things – I had to let her go. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna faded away…to her home…and 
the Mirror broke into millions of miniscule, irreparable pieces. Link 
cried aloud, but I just let the tears fall. It was finished, but Midna’s 
memory was not. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I never saw her again…</font> <br>
 <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">…I never saw her on the bridge 
that we made…</font> <br> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">…I never saw her in my bedroom 
again…</font> <br> <br> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">…I only saw her in my dreams. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>It has taken me 
three years to completely absorb everything that 
transpired in that time and put it down into writing. Even now, I can 
barely hold back the tears, as fresh as the day Midna left. </i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Midna was right when she 
said that my citizens would ask that I marry the Hero chosen by the 
Goddesses. Loving him a great deal by then and wanting to please my 
people, I did so. </i></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Midna was right when she 
said that Link and I were created for one another. It took some adjustment 
to being married (the long line of suitors are gone forever!) and it 
especially took time to learn making love with a man, but I must say 
that I enjoy the state of being married and the bond of past suffering 
and trial that Link and I share.</i></font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Many mornings, I wake up 
in Link’s arms and I feel his sleeping breath on my neck. 
Its times like this I can’t help but smile 
– for no particular reason. </i></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Let it be known throughout 
the land of Hyrule, for this age and for future ages 
– this is not only a story of good triumphing over evil. </i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>It is a love story. </i></font> <br>
