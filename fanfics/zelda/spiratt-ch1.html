******************************

The sun was setting outside again. For now the supreme heat of the day 
was prominent but in one or two hours the first cold breeze would 
announce the change significant for this area, the first warning of 
the cold and harsh night to come. It was apparent that the Gerudo 
tribe, that supposedly had lived in this land as long as the ancient 
and now mostly mythical Sheikah existed, had adapted well to the 
climate, becoming nearly immune to the extreme weather conditions. Of 
course, they had their shelter to return to at night and the benefit 
of light - nearly non-existent - clothing and well-accustomed physic 
for the day. Couldn&#39;t say that about me, in my current situation.
	If I hadn&#39;t gone mad by now, I believe it had been the fifth day 
that was close to its end now, transiting into night soon. I wasn&#39;t 
entirely sure which I loathed more, day or night. Both were unbearable 
in their own right. Next to the heat of the day there was the sandy 
and dusty smell in the air, the lack of humidity and while I was not 
directly exposed to the sun in here, the heat crept into the chamber 
through the entrance and small windows. And at night... Well, why I 
had become ALMOST glad for the absence of clothing, the cold, biting 
wind that blew into the valley from the desert made not so much for a 
refreshing contrast but a drastic change.
	&#39;This is really a fine situation you got yourself into,&#39; I 
thought miserably, trying to get remotely comfortable, which was 
impossible at the moment. And all this, because I had been too 
curious, playing with fire where I shouldn&#39;t have. It was too late for 
that now though. I had walked too far down this path and could only 
cling to the hope that somehow I would make it to the end...

******************************
******************************

	I had seen her arrive at late morning while I was tending to the 
horses. The most beautiful sight I had ever laid eyes on. And with 
that, I didn&#39;t mean the black stallion or whatever the breed was 
because I had never seen a horse like this before. No, I meant its 
rider, the lean woman with dark, tanned skin and blood-red hair tied 
into a long ponytail. She had a matriarchal air around her, something 
regal and dominating, something dangerous and at the same time... 
strangely appealing.
	I believe I had stared at her for several long minutes, my gaze 
lingering in the place where she had vanished into the house with my 
father to discuss business. And when I finally managed to shake of my 
focus, it was like awakening from a dream and I wondered for a moment 
if the woman had really been there.
	I looked around and spotted the black horse standing just 
outside the fenced area where all the other horses were kept during 
the day. Curious, I approached slowly, marveling at the beauty 
contained in the tall mare. I had never seen a breed like that before. 
At a glance I could tell that it was by far stronger, faster, more 
durable and more agile than any other horse I had ever laid eyes on, 
except maybe for Epona. It was black as the night with a contrasting 
snow-white mane and clear fiery red eyes that regarded me with an 
impassive yet highly intelligent look that I couldn&#39;t quite interpret.
	Hesitantly I reached out with one hand, awed and humbled, mixed 
with a little of inconceivable fear...
	&quot;I wouldn&#39;t do that.&quot;
	I jerked my hand away and involuntarily took a step away before 
I even considered turning towards the sharp, commanding voice. My 
breath caught in my throat as I found myself mere INCHES away from the 
Gerudo woman. I hadn&#39;t even heard her approach! I usually never had 
problems in dealing with strangers and their usual quirks and natures. 
Working on a ranch taught you quickly how to handle even the most 
shady sorts of people. But the tall, exotic woman evoked a myriad of 
strange emotions in me, among which was a very potent fascination. I 
couldn&#39;t explain to myself why I felt this way, why I felt so 
strangely attracted to the stranger. Or was she a stranger?
	The Gerudo woman bored into me with golden eyes that seemed to 
know everything that passed through my mind and as if proving this 
fact a knowing smile and calculating gleam in her eyes made me shudder 
slightly. &quot;Hello there, little girl,&quot; the Gerudo eventually said in a 
deep, self-assured voice - not to a degree of haughtiness but still 
making me somewhat bristle at the arrogance and aloof attitude. &quot;I see 
you were interested in Sha&#39;ie&#39;lou, yes?&quot; The knowing grin had not 
vanished but instead intensified as my wandering gaze was caught in 
golden eyes - I hadn&#39;t even been aware of scrutinizing the exotic 
beauty as if... yes, as if... I was checking out a very handsome 
man...
	The thought startled me and I stood stock-still as the Gerudo 
slipped past me, casually letting her hand brush against my hip 
through the fabric of my clothing in a way that made it almost 
impossible to call an accident.
	&quot;You have no idea how to handle a horse like this,&quot; the Gerudo 
woman said as she stepped past me. I followed her movements transfixed 
as she proceeded to mount the brute. The horse&#39;s reactions reminded me 
of Epona and how she used to be around anyone but Fairy Boy and 
myself. The woman was making no attempt of handling her - I was pretty 
sure about that - with care, instead she seemed insistent on a certain 
roughness, as if needing to remind the horse who was the stronger one. 
In fact, the steed only put up a brief but powerful struggle which the 
Gerudo seemed to have no problem handling, before her rider was on her 
back. For the first time I realized that it was not saddled, appearing 
more as if taken directly from the wilderness instead of tamed for 
riding. A fierce spirit which grudgingly submitted to a superior one.
	There might have been several reasons why I had spoken up then, 
a logical one might be that I always was over-protective of the horses 
and other animals here. I had cared for them so long, I never liked 
seeing one badly treated, even if it wasn&#39;t one of ours. In the end 
though much more caused the fierce response that I managed with a 
sudden spark of courage, much more that I would only understand much 
later. &quot;I am not a little girl and I know enough about horses to tell 
you that you are never to gain this one&#39;s trust the way you are 
treating her!&quot;
	The Gerudo&#39;s head whipped around at the challenging tone in my 
voice that surprised even me. I didn&#39;t like shouting, violence or any 
other kind of excessive behavior. I liked to sing, basking in the joy 
and calmness of the activity, to interact with the animals here and 
care for them. Oh sure, I could get indignant at father, but that was 
necessary sometimes.
	Once again the Gerudo smiled and this time it had a hint of... I 
couldn&#39;t really tell. There was something that worried and excited me 
at the same time. &quot;That might be true for the mares you keep here but 
for ours which have to fit in with the harsh desert and their other 
purposes for us, this would make them much too soft to be of any use 
to us.&quot; She made the black mare trot forward so that she was just next 
to me and then peered down on me with a steely gaze. There was a 
beckoning in the golden eyes, as if daring me to further challenge 
her. She leaned forward slightly and I felt tiny in comparison. &quot;Or do 
you intend to teach me, whose race has survived the hard conditions of 
the desert for ages, wrong?&quot;
	I didn&#39;t answer. Every instinct inside of me screamed to avert 
my gaze and admit defeat. I knew I had spoken out of line. There was 
obviously a deep respect and understanding between rider and horse and 
truthfully I was just a simple ranch girl who really had no experience 
to make accusations here. However, I couldn&#39;t pull away from the 
golden eyes which&#39;s gaze stirred something deep inside me that I had 
no idea where it would take me, but which I couldn&#39;t escape...

******************************
******************************

	And from that moment onwards, I had been lost. Complete and 
utterly enthralled with Nabooru, leader of the Gerudo tribe. Only 
later on, after she had been long gone, had I figured out the hint of 
familiarity. She had been there on Fairy Boy&#39;s wedding a couple of 
weeks before. I hadn&#39;t paid her much more than a side-glance notice 
then, she had kept pretty much away from the bulk of the party as it 
seemed.
	A seed had been laid that day though, a seed that would quickly 
grow into something wild and uncontrollable. Nabooru had come back 
several days later and in semi-regular periods after that, seemingly 
with no real necessity. After all, the Gerudos were known for their 
fine horses and obviously knew how to take care of them, not needing 
the &quot;soft-heartened treatment&quot; of some ranchers.
	No, that hadn&#39;t been why the Gerudo leader had returned again 
and again. She was there for me, and me alone. The notion was exciting 
and frightening at the same time. With my daring, challenging attitude 
from the first meeting I had caught Nabooru&#39;s interest and while I 
knew deep down that I should be stopping the game that started between 
us - a subtle game of challenge which&#39;s exact purpose I wasn&#39;t quite 
certain of -, I could not. I was playing with fire but the fatal 
attraction I was developing for the warrior woman - a term I preferred 
over thief - was too strong, too intoxicating, I was long gone already 
before I realized that fact.
	&#39;Yes, a very nice situation you got yourself into, Malon,&#39; I 
repeated and my eyes darted to the side as I heard footsteps from the 
entrance to the dungeon. I knew what was coming, who was coming. 
Nearly five full days of treatment that went beyond my wildest 
imagination had brought me to my limits. I didn&#39;t know how much longer 
I could hold out but when I thought back at the absolute trust and 
conviction in Nabooru&#39;s eyes when this had all begun, I was more 
afraid to see her disappointment. The mental challenge of wills had 
gone on too long already for me to give in now and draw her 
disapproval. I would show her that I could stand up to her, maybe not 
physical but at least spiritually.

******************************

	I had always valued strength over everything in my life. Not 
just the physical strength like so many others of my tribal sisters 
did. No, I wasn&#39;t that pitiful and thus easy to impress and manipulate 
much like Ganondorf did to the others. There were many types of 
strength and one of the strongest was that of the spirit. The power of 
one&#39;s spirit, the strength of an unwavering heart was independent from 
upbringing, social status or the mere physical aspects. A powerful 
will was much more beautiful and much more honorable than just being 
able to slash someone apart with a sword.
	The Gerudo&#39;s way of living, their fighting style was supposed to 
be a mirror of this principle. A strong will as a basis to surpass the 
limits, the borders between body and mind and merge them together. Or 
so my mothers had taught me when I was still very young, before 
Ganondorf came... and sent them into exile for standing up against 
them. Over time I had watched as many more succumbed far too easy to 
the King of Evil, that they would not question but simply follow. All 
this merely because of some ancient law, regardless of whether or not 
they agreed with his motives or not. That was not how we were supposed 
to live. This had not been strength of the heart.
	Malon of Lon Lon Ranch was far stronger than many of the Gerudos 
that lived in this valley now. I had seen it from that first moment 
onward, the beautiful and vibrant spirit that lurked just beneath the 
gentle demeanor of the young girl. I hadn&#39;t come looking for her that 
day, just a random encounter, but one that I believed to be fated. 
Malon had needed something, a trigger to draw out that fierce spirit 
that I had instantly admired. I knew instinctively that if the 
circumstances had been different, if she had for example been born a 
Gerudo, she would have made a fine warrior, if not one of the best.
	I had to have her.
	Of course, not without her consent. By no means would I sink to 
the low levels of those that had followed Ganondorf. Yet, I was still 
a Gerudo and a proud one, a proud Gerudo who had set her sights on a 
simple human girl. I was the best of my kin and I always got what I 
wanted if I really had a mind to pursue it. I gave her many chances to 
back out, and just as many to stake my claim further. However, the 
auburn-haired human would not back down, the spiritual flame ignited 
in her soul that day of our first - well, technically second - meeting 
was not to be extinguished again. Its fire already too vivid.
	It had been a courtship worthy of a Gerudo elite warrior.
	My eyes hardened noticeably as the other Gerudo stepped past me, 
clad in the usual purple but with a noticeable degree of extra jewelry 
to signify her higher rank. She turned her head and I could swear I 
saw the smirk behind the veil covering her mouth, her cool eyes 
sparkled with determination and certain triumph. I met the gaze with 
confidence, assured in my chosen mate&#39;s inner strength, a confidence 
born from the belief that had carried me through all the years of 
Ganondorf&#39;s reign and the reconstruction that followed with petty 
power struggles.
	&quot;Do not cross the line, Alana,&quot; I warned silently. I did not 
believe she would dare with me watching but Alana had been one of 
Ganondorf&#39;s most loyal followers. We had never been of one opinion and 
with her king gone a constant struggle had erupted between us. I was, 
of course, still higher in rank and she had no hopes of defeating me 
in a fair combat to claim leadership, yet she was still skilled and 
also cunning. Alana would prove the greatest challenge to my chosen 
mate during the ritual which would come to an end tonight and which 
had begun over six days ago, on the very night after my last visit to 
Lon Lon Ranch. The night that I had taken what was soon to be mine.

******************************
******************************
	Total harmony of body and mind. The main principle of my life 
and that of any other Gerudo, or so it should be. We were masters of 
battle, silent, fast and merciless would we defeat our opponents and 
take that which we have set our eyes on. That was our way of life, 
nothing would change that, Ganondorf had nothing to do with this, 
neither his ascend nor his dismissal. No, we were proud thieves, the 
shadows were our friends, only rivaled or bested by the Sheikah maybe. 
There even were myths that the shadow folk and the Gerudo had the same 
roots, one splitting from the other at one point in history to form 
their own legacy.
	My footsteps were soundless as I crept along the wall of the 
barn, carefully making sure that no stray, unexpected look could spot 
me in the darkness of the early night. Not that this level of 
discretion was really necessary. Getting into Lon Lon Ranch unnoticed 
was child&#39;s play. I had made sure already that Talon was asleep. It 
would take a gibdo&#39;s scream anyway to wake him up. That grim man, 
Ingo, was off on an errand and would not be back tonight. There was 
only one person still awake, and that person was exactly who I came 
here for.
	No, there wasn&#39;t a real need to be cautious. However, I was a 
proud Gerudo, and had not excelled past the limits of all others of my 
kin just merely by status and fate as a sage. I prided myself with 
perfection in what I was doing. It had galled me that Twinrova had 
managed to surprise me back then, before the Imprisoning War. I would 
not be so careless again. Besides, Malon, my chosen mate, deserved 
nothing less than total perfection in the execution of the mating 
ritual.
	Tonight would be the night I had looked forward to during the 
last weeks when I had come again and again to stake my claim on the 
fierce daughter of the ranch owner, the one whose spirit had captured 
my heart. Just earlier in the day I had all but openly declared my 
intention of taking her as my mate. Not in such direct words but I was 
certain that she had understood the meaning.
	I slipped inside the barn, still not making any sound, either by 
movement or through the door. There she was, a vision of natural, 
striking beauty. Yet it had never been the outward appearance that had 
truly fascinated me. Certainly with the long, auburn hair, neatly 
combed and the smooth skin, Malon could already be considered a 
physical beauty. However, her true loveliness lay in the spirit I had 
worked so hard to coax to the fore front.
	I watched her for some time from the shadows in the corner as 
she tended to the cows, tender and loving. I had not intended to evoke 
the impression of being a cruel person with my remarks during that 
brief first talk weeks ago, and I believe she had understood on some 
level.
	To be fair, I was kind of envious of her simple outlook on life, 
not the harsh traditions and lifestyle of the Gerudos I had grown up 
in. She had the spirit worthy of a warrior, true, but violence was 
something alien to her mind. She believe in soothing where other 
resorted to the sword to solve a problem. It was an endearing quality 
and surely one that our tribe could only benefit from if she proved to 
meet all my expectations. She had a quiet, inner strength that if 
provoked could cut deeper than any blade. If she were to be at my 
side, many of those that still followed Ganondorf&#39;s ideals would 
quickly need to rethink their views.
	Yes, I was certain now that I had made the right choice.
	With a couple of swift but still silent steps I was behind her 
and pulled her tight against my taller body. A squeal of surprise and 
fear emerged from the ranch girl&#39;s lips as she turned her head to get 
a glance at her assailant. Blue eyes widened in astonishment, but I 
gave her no time to contemplate the situation. &quot;I told you I would 
make you mine,&quot; I whispered in her ear just before my lips crushed 
onto hers, pressing their claim as they had earlier in the day when 
one of our half-playful, half-serious arguments had converted their 
underlying subtext into reality.

******************************
******************************

	The next morning I was already almost all the way to the valley 
with my &#39;loot&#39; before Malon had even awoken. As was part of the mating 
ritual, I had her sitting in front of me on Sha&#39;ie&#39;lou, with her hands 
bound and her scattered clothes from last night removed, leaving her 
completely naked and exposed to see for everyone who happened to spot 
her.
	I had to admire her courage and calmness - although I was 
certain she was battling terror on the inside - as I explained about 
the ritual that was to follow in as much as detail as I was allowed 
to. I could tell she was clearly offended by the idea, many outsiders 
were. But this ritual was an important part of our culture ever since 
we could remember. Exclusive to the elite, it was especially made for 
this situation. A situation where the leader of the tribe or another 
strong member would claim an outsider of lower status as their equal, 
as their mate. And I was surely not going to settle with keeping Malon 
merely as a slave of lower status. She was worth far more than that.
	After arriving at the valley, she would be tested by the tribe. 
An outsider of low status would have to earn the respect - grudging or 
otherwise - of the tribe by showing her will, her loyalty to the one 
who had exerted claim on her. In almost all cases the ritual was meant 
for outsider woman, for a man to equal in status was very rare. If she 
did not prove strong enough, the outsider was considered unworthy and 
thus free to be claimed by anyone.
	The test was simple. And, as most of the other races would call 
it - especially the humans and hylians -, &quot;barbaric&quot;. I would not 
agree. The body in many ways was the most traitorous and only a strong 
spirit could overcome its limits and weakness. So, to expose the body 
of the outsider to the whims of the Gerudo wishing to participate in 
the five days and five nights long ritual might be a harsh but 
justifiable method of proving her worth. There were, of, course, 
certain rules that applied and which I had warned my strongest rival 
not to break.
	She would not survive the consequence anyway.
	I watched with a growing pride as much to the more and more 
apparent frustration of Alana, my chosen mate did not yield to her 
ministrations. Despite the Gerudo&#39;s rough handling, the flame of her 
spirit did not die, it continued to burn, holding strong against any 
and all attempts - both soft and cunning, as well as hard and violent 
- of making Malon submit to Alana. She would not surrender what was 
only for me to have, as proof of her loyalty. None of them was allowed 
to touch her there, to take away her physical innocence unless Malon 
explicitly begged for it.
	However, Malon had remained firm, all this time, throughout all 
the Gerudo - and it really been the main portion of the tribe that had 
participated in the ritual - that tested her will. She had remained 
strong.
	For me.
	I was certain of that last part. After all, I had made it clear 
to her on our ride to the valley that if she wanted to, I would return 
her home right away. However, Malon had not voiced a single complaint, 
not said one word to hint at her resistance until we were past the 
borders to my homeland and there was no turning back anymore.
	I allowed myself a small, triumphant grin as Alana brushed past 
me angrily, leaving Malon as she was, chained against the bars of the 
cell, a shortage of food and water beyond the absolute necessity 
clearly showing. It was a wonder that she could still keep a conscious 
state of mind, another testament for her spiritual strength.
	The sun had set outside. The fifth night of this part of the 
ritual had begun, and Malon had emerged victorious from her challenge. 
From this point on, there were two choices, deny even me and return to 
her home, a proud and acknowledged warrior equal to the Gerudo or, and 
that was the one which I preferred and by now believed to be the 
inevitable outcome, to acknowledge my claim.
	&quot;Now, little girl, I will make you my queen.&quot; And with that I 
stepped out of the shadows into plain view and met blue eyes 
magnetically swiveling to rest on my own with a steady, unwavering 
gaze. There was no doubt about it. When this night ended, she would 
truly be mine.

******************************
	Lemon
******************************

	I had not yet caught my breath when I saw her step out of the 
shadows. Actually, I hadn&#39;t even been looking, winded and exhausted 
from the treatment by the hand of the previous Gerudo. That one had 
been cruel. Most of them had merely been insistent and despite my 
mental aversion, I actually enjoyed some. With some I could tell that 
they might have wanted to do more but obviously feared their leader&#39;s 
reaction should they go too far. That last one had come close to 
driving me over the edge. I had been almost ready to give in just to 
end the torture, just to be done with it, regardless of the 
consequences.
	But when I saw her standing there, I realized why I had somehow 
found the courage within me to resist this long. I had wanted to show 
Nabooru that I wasn&#39;t just a little girl, that my way of thinking 
wouldn&#39;t automatically imply weakness, that I wouldn&#39;t break under 
extreme stress as she often implied the horses I helped raise in the 
fashion mother had raised me would. And the pride I saw when golden 
eyes looked at me intensely, caused a tingle of pleasure to run down 
my spine.
	Nabooru grinned seductively and I watched transfixed as she ran 
her hands over her body. Unconsciously I licked my dry lips when she 
let her top drop to the ground, freeing nicely-shaped breasts with 
pointy white nipples. Not leaving me with her eyes, Nabooru cupped one 
of them and let a little moan escape her lips that made me shudder in 
anticipation. Anticipation of what I knew was to come and what my 
entire self, whether or not some part of me denied it, craved more 
than anything ever before. I hadn&#39;t been able to tear myself away from 
what I knew would be a dangerous attraction from the very beginning 
and now I was too far caught in the spiral of need and desire that had 
come to a temporary climax merely a good week ago to complain.

******************************
******************************

	My head swam as I tried to cope with the situation and failed to 
do so properly in the cauldron of emotions the Gerudo woman created 
with her demanding and to a point bruising kisses. It all happened too 
fast to comprehend and I lost myself in the moment. The tall woman&#39;s 
strong arms felt safe, holding me secure to her body as she continued 
to assault my mouth with her own. Her tongue pushed down onto my own, 
further exerting her dominance.
	A gasp was swallowed this way when, with one strong motion, 
Nabooru had ripped through the upper part of my dress. I squirmed 
slightly but it was no use as the Gerudo was far stronger than a first 
glance would make you believe. Before I knew what exactly was 
happening the rest of my clothing had been discarded and would not be 
of much use anymore.
	The Gerudo&#39;s hands seemed to be everywhere at once and I could 
only utter silent cries that I wasn&#39;t sure whether they were of 
pleasure or protest, maybe both. Strong, somewhat calloused hands that 
had seen many battles and that had surely killed more than once. They 
found my bra and slipped underneath it, two fingers tugging at the 
middle strap connecting the two halves and pulled sharply. With a snap 
the garment fell to the side and Nabooru wasted no more times. I 
surely shrieked when the thief grabbed my breasts hard, enveloping 
them in a steel-like grip and starting to massage them firmly. Pangs 
of pain mingled into incredible pleasure and washed my mind away with 
dizzying speed.
	Moments - or minutes, I wasn&#39;t sure - later I was slammed hard 
against a pillar from the wooden gate behind me. Nabooru had turned me 
around and now pushed her body against mine. Her own clothes had been 
discarded in a more intact state - although if you asked me I couldn&#39;t 
tell when - and so the friction created by her own chest pressing into 
mine as well as other parts of our bodies further below was spreading 
a tsunami of heat over my entire body.
	I hissed in pleasure when Nabooru pushed one of her shapely legs 
between my own, her thigh rubbing against my own center. She held me 
up with just her body now and one hand on my hip as the other had come 
up to tangle in my hair, trailing a line of kisses, nipples and the 
occasional bite along my neck and throat. Suddenly her mouth was on my 
right breast and I bucked as she simultaneously increased friction of 
her leg below.
	I screamed as my head spun from an insistent bite on my tender 
flesh, the Gerudo&#39;s teeth penetrating the skin slightly and leaving a 
mark there. My hands were wrapped around Nabooru&#39;s neck and while I 
loathed to be so completely vulnerable and inactive, I could only hold 
on as the Gerudo woman pushed me further and further to new heights I 
hadn&#39;t even known existed before tonight.

******************************
******************************

	Only later did I learn why despite the rough and dominating way 
Nabooru had claimed me in the barn that night, she had never went past 
my virgin barrier. A part of me had almost begged for it but another 
had clung to a rebellious notion, a notion that had carried all 
throughout the ritual. Now though that part had become silent, just a 
distant echo because my entire self, not just my body, cried out for 
the renewal of that night, of the completion of the task being done 
there.
	And so I didn&#39;t say a word as I followed Nabooru walking over 
towards me, drinking up the exotic vision that I had come to both love 
and loath for the effect she had on me. But then again, love and 
loathing were often said to be merely two sides of the same coin.

******************************

	My eyes scanned her critically as I advanced towards the cell. 
Malon was currently facing the bars, confined against them by the 
chains wrapped around her wrists and now looped through the bars, her 
ankles were similarly bound and all that she could do was stepping 
away one or two inches from the bars on her own accord. The girl&#39;s 
soft skin was bruised in some places but nothing that I believed to be 
permanent. Well, except the mark I had left on her breast during our 
first mating stage. I had made sure that would be permanent. What 
worried me more was the barely restrained exhaustion from days of 
being exposed to the sexual desire and whims of my fellow Gerudo and 
the strain of upholding her remarkable will against those assaults.
	Coming to a stop in front of the bars I reached out to cup one 
of Malon&#39;s cheeks and draw her closer, blue eyes met mine unwavering 
in a show of somewhat playful, somewhat realistic defiance. I chuckled 
merrily. &quot;You have done very well.&quot; I traced the side of her face with 
my fingernails that I had made sure were sharpened before tonight. The 
ranch girl shuddered but remained still.
	Grasping her chin, I unclasped a vial from my belt with my free 
hand and brought it to her lips through the bars. &quot;Drink,&quot; I commanded 
with a voice that broke no argument. Still she eyed the reddish liquid 
warily for a moment before hesitantly complying. The potion would not 
heal her, but it would take care of the fatigue, so that she was ready 
for what was to come. After she swallowed it all, I threw the vial to 
the side and proceeded to open my belt, letting my pants fall to the 
floor. I smirked in satisfaction as Malon&#39;s eyes almost immediately 
trailed southwards.
	Reaching through the bars with both hands, I pulled her body 
forward by the tips of her nipples alone, trapping a good portion of 
her breasts between the bars and making the girl wince in obvious 
pain, yet she remained silent, giving me her full attention. Good.
	&quot;Now I will make you mine,&quot; I promised.
	I took my time going around the bars, through the door of the 
cell and finally up behind the helpless girl. To my mild surprise the 
auburn-haired ranch girl had not moved or made any attempt to free her 
chest from its uncomfortable place. In fact she remained perfectly 
still as I ran my hands up and down her sides, inspecting her back and 
her lovely behind - cupping the slightly reddened cheeks in the 
process. Surely her butt had suffered the most under the treatment, 
not being off-limit and so an obvious target for stimulation or 
punishment depending on the individual character. Allowing myself a 
tiny snarl at the freshest and most obvious marks, I made a mental 
note to ensure a proper reckoning for Alana later on. Maybe she had 
not overstepped her boundaries but I could surely find enough reasons 
to show my disapproval.
	Well, for now, it was time to make Malon forget completely about 
the last five days and establish once more who was the only one that 
would have a right to touch her without her consent from now onwards.
	Starting of slow I allowed my own nether lips to rub against and 
in between her butt cheeks, calling forth a delightful symphony of 
moans and groans from their owner. After a minute or so of doing this, 
I decided that it was time for the main event. It was time now to make 
her beg, really beg, make her plead to belong to me, to make me 
complete her as no one else ever could.
	Pushing forward, I used my superior strength to flatten the girl 
against the bars, and my hands slipped between them to start on her 
chest. I still had my belt in my hands, initially planning on 
something a bit more kinky but after seeing what she had already 
endured, filed away that notion for a later time. I played awhile with 
her breasts, flicking, tucking, pinching and twisting the nipples, 
occasionally using the leather belt to rub over the by now extremely 
sensitive skin. All the while I denied her the pleasure of a kiss, 
instead nuzzling her hair and neck.
	Then, with a sudden motion that took Malon completely off guard, 
I wrapped the belt around her chest tightly, fastening the golden 
clasp on her right one, just above the mark I had given her. She 
shrieked loudly and strained against the pain but I held her tight. In 
fact I had her trapped effortlessly against the bars, my legs 
positioned on either side, leaving her not much space to spread them 
any further than I wanted her to. My hands slipped down her body, 
resting on her thighs and waiting patiently.
	Malon didn&#39;t say anything... yet.
	Grinning wickedly I assumed now was the best time to play my 
final trump card. The only one besides the virgin rule that none of 
them other than the captor was allowed to break whether they were 
capable or not. I knew where were many rumors outside of how the 
Gerudo reproduced without males born in their society except for one 
every one hundred years. While it was true that we did take men from 
the towns, that was by far not our only means of reproduction. In fact 
mating with a lower male was not considered to produce good offspring. 
The true means for our strong genes making us immune to dilation from 
the outside was now slowly emerging from my skin, just above my own 
cunt, pressing with immediate hardness and just as responsive as a 
male&#39;s tool - maybe even more so - against the ranch girl&#39;s rear 
entrance.
	When Malon was surprised by the earlier action, my heart leapt 
now by the scream of total rapture when, without foreplay, I entered 
her swift and demanding, hammering into her relentlessly, making her 
body impact again and again with the cold steel. I pulled her head 
back by grasping a good handful of hair and kissed her thoroughly to 
swallow the screams. Her eyes were shut tightly and I could see tears 
slipping past the lids, but no protest, no word came past her lips. My 
remaining hand trailed around her front entrance, carving a stinging 
path with my fingernails.
	I pulled away sharply from Malon&#39;s mouth making her whimper. 
&quot;Look at me,&quot; I hissed huskily, jerking forward with a particular 
powerful thrust that went all the way in until it couldn&#39;t go any 
further. Blue eyes snapped open, glazed with lust and need.
	&quot;Please...&quot; Her voice was raw and barely above a whisper but it 
made my heart flutter with both triumph and adoration. I had not 
thought she would hold out that long but now she was ready to 
acknowledge her place. As I continued to drive my hardness into her, 
rocking her back and forth again and again, she began to chant that 
one word in earnest.
	&#39;Mine,&#39; a primal part of me growled and my eyes bored into her 
own. &quot;What do you want, little girl.&quot;
	Malon had obvious trouble responding under my relentless 
assault, but eventually the plea I had longed for tumbled from her 
lips with concrete, clear meaning. &quot;Please... take me... make me... 
yours.&quot;
	&quot;Mine,&quot; I growled this time aloud and more swiftly when Malon 
could follow I had switched targets below.

******************************

	The last bit of resistance crumbled away like so many tiny 
grains of sand under Nabooru&#39;s hungry gaze. There was something 
animalistic about her, not just in the way she kept pounding into my 
rear with that big phallus that she had suddenly sprouted - my mind 
refused to properly analyze that circumstance - but especially in her 
eyes. The look of a predator before it claimed its prey, forcing the 
prey into submission by mere will. Many had tried before during these 
five days and nights but I had never yielded. It wasn&#39;t that I didn&#39;t 
have the mental power anymore, the potion that Nabooru had given me 
had been remarkably invigorating. No, it was the secure, absolute 
knowledge that I could not wait, that I could not and did not want to 
resist any longer. And so I submitted and my heart sighed in blissful 
defeat that it actually had craved the moment I first met the exotic 
woman.
	I was very grateful that the Gerudo had claimed my mouth again 
or I might have snapped my vocal cords. The movement was too swift to 
anticipate and prepare for, just between one thrust and another that 
had come now in strong succession, Nabooru thrust between my legs, in 
one swift movement breaking through my maidenhood and burying her 
member deep into my cunt. My vision erupted into a blinding light and 
did not have time to reassert itself as the woman behind me began a 
similar rough pace like moments before in my other hole. What was 
worst and at the same time even contributing more to the sheer ecstasy 
coursing through me was that she would not allow me to spread my legs 
further, making each intrusion with which she pushed a little further 
painful, spreading hot, white fire through my entire body and mind.
	While one stayed to play and tug at my clit, the other hand had 
come up to cover my left breast again, gripping onto them to a degree 
where I thought she would tear them apart any moment while tugging on 
the belt to make the clasp over my over breast dig into the mark she 
had left where during our first night.
	The first release when she broke through my virgin barrier 
followed a second and a third and after that I quickly lost count as 
Nabooru would not let up, proving that while she applied a male organ, 
she was still hundred percent female and not to mention a hardened 
warrior with the appropriate, near infinite stamina. Under the 
beautifully brutal assault I quickly reached my limits but the Gerudo 
did not slow down. In fact the phallus between my legs seemed to 
actually swell with each release - releases that were perfectly 
synchronized with my own.
	Tears of pleasure and pain stung in my eyes as I tried to focus 
on the golden eyes devouring me. A silent message passed between them, 
the prey that acknowledged the superior predator, and the predator 
that knew exactly it had won and savored the taste of triumph. &quot;You 
are mine,&quot; Nabooru stated again, daring me one last time to challenge 
her claim.
	I did not. &quot;Yours,&quot; I confirmed and let out a loud screech I was 
sure the entire valley heard as its strongest resident claimed her 
prize with one final thrust, burying her full length to the hilt in my 
enflamed cunt, digging two of her sharp fingers into my clit to 
emphasize. I could have sworn pure energy crackled through my entire 
being as the release overtook me and swept away my consciousness 
somewhere entirely else but nevertheless enveloped by the stronger 
presence of my lover, captor and mistress.
	&#39;Always yours,&#39; my mind chanted over and over again until it 
became a roaring inferno.

THE END (for now)

Author&#39;s Notes

Well, that was a little longer actually than Leaves. Not that I 
planned on that but it just happened.
While I had the rough idea for this already when I started Leaves, it 
only began to shape into a clear picture when I wrapped it up and 
flowed nicely from the moment I started this (in fact I began 
yesterday). That was rather interesting to write and there is a lot of 
open room to fill in later... if I ever find the time. I think I 
became strangely attached to the pairing! ^_^

I hope you liked it as much as I enjoyed writing. Yes, this was a lot 
less light than Leaves, but I hope I managed to bring across the 
message that I did not write this because I delight in seeing innocent 
girls chained up and tortured. ^_^ (for all you moral apostles out 
there who are blind to sarcasm, I do NOT delight in it) On a scale 
compared this Mistletoes this was nothing after all... ^_^
Whether or not I chose to expand this, depends on many factors. Mostly 
my time/other projects and my whimsy muse. Plans exist in my head 
though (there are too much of them, for too much stories anyway).

Feedback as always appreciated and readily welcomed. And just as a 
side note, constructive feedback might be easier to coax me into 
writing more than merely saying I should.

Oh, and yes, I haven&#39;t forgotten Lines, for all who have read that 
one. I may return to it... someday.

Ja ne, yours
