<h1>The Hidden Waters of the Heart (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../zelda/index.html">Legend of Zelda</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/missleanne.html">Diane "Miss Leanne" Taylor</a><br> </h2>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>She has been running and 
running for just over seven years. Her job of hiding from the Evil King 
Ganondorf’s grasp only becomes more difficult with each passing day 
– indeed, with each passing hour. Since the day the Hero of Time was 
sealed within the Chamber of Sages, she has hidden within a disguise 
of a Sheikah man. Her disguise’s name is Sheik. When Ganondorf initially 
took hold of the Triforce inside the Sacred Realm, it was clear to her 
that she was no longer safe – he would be after her piece of the Triforce 
as well. </i></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>She decided that the closer 
she was to danger, the further away she was from harm. She took on the 
mask of Sheik and installed herself in Ganondorf’s councils, bringing 
herself very close to danger indeed. She knows the risks she takes. 
She listens to the information discussed in Ganondorf’s councils and 
passes it on to those who can utilize that knowledge better than she. </i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>But her disguise is wearing 
thin, becoming suspicious and showing flaws. She cannot help but hear 
the whispers behind her back as she sits in Ganondorf’s councils 
– after seven years of standing close to Ganondorf, familiarity is 
not only breeding contempt, it is breeding silent questions she would 
be afraid to answer, were they asked. Oh, she is perfectly aware of 
the piling risks and the rate at which they are building. But she cannot 
move from her position in Ganondorf’s court. To do so risks exposure 
that might not come as quickly if she stays. What else can she do?</i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>She is tired. She is tried 
of constantly watching her back. Tired of the fear and adrenaline shrieking 
through her veins each time she enters Ganondorf’s presence. The nights 
without sleep, the days without food and little water, the weeks 
and months without rest, the hours of waiting are filing down on her 
resolve. She waits for something, anything, to happen. She waits for 
the other shoe to drop, for the trigger to spring, for the storm to 
break loose. The anticipation threatens to mentally sabotage her. </i></font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>She hopes against hope that 
she is not discovered before she and the Hero of Time, Link, meet together 
before defeating Ganondorf. She knows what will happen if Ganondorf 
prematurely discovers her. He will take her Triforce and kill her, 
without further ado. But she keeps faith in Link. She has no doubt that 
he can single-handedly bring Ganondorf down, with or without her help. </i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>But she carries feelings 
within her heart for the man she calls 
“Hero.” If she felt safe in doing so, she might say that these feelings 
are little more than fond tenderness for him. She watched over him while 
his growing form slept in the Chamber of Sages. She watches over him 
while he walks down the path to awaken each Sage, created to seal Ganondorf 
away from Hyrule, her kingdom. She admires his determination not to 
grow bitter over his seemingly unwarranted status as 
“Hero of Time.” She loves to watch him in battle, to watch the grace 
with which he wields the Master Sword. But she pushes down these feelings 
in the name of Sheik. </i>I’ve come this far,<i> she thinks.</i> I 
cannot let anything happen now. <i>If only she knows how those feelings 
will betray her. If only she knows to which person these feelings will 
flow. </i></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>She is still deeply unsure 
as to the future path the Goddesses have chosen for her. She cannot 
decide at which direction her heart’s compass is pointing. Keeping 
her slowly crumbling disguise consumes her. </i></font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>She loves, she fights, she 
watches, she scrambles and she tries to keep away the tears for her 
scattered people, her shattered life and her scorched country. </i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>She is a woman in her heart. 
She is a thinly disguised man in body. She is a crown princess by birth. 
First and foremost though, she is Zelda. </i></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~ </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda, disguised as Sheik, 
sat close to Ganondorf’s council chamber chair. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“And have you been successful 
in discovering the whereabouts of the Princess Zelda?” Ganondorf asked. 
His bass voice thrummed through the tense atmosphere ominously. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“No, my lord,” the farmer 
called Ingo replied from his position on the floor, cowering underneath 
the gaze of the fearsome Evil King. “The Hero of Time briefly mentioned 
her as he passed through, but he did not say anything as to her whereabouts.” 
Ingo’s hands visibly shook from their position on the floor. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ganondorf sighed. “How long…how <i>
long</i>?” He quietly said to no one in particular. “How much longer 
must I wait?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Sheik heard Ganondorf’s whispers 
from his position close to Ganondorf. “My liege,” he said with a 
low tone, “let me take on the assignment of finding the Princess and 
bringing her to you.” Ganondorf turned his head to regard Sheik. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“My people were trained solely 
for the purpose of blending in with the shadows,” Sheik said. “Who 
knows – perhaps the Princess you seek is hiding in one of those shadows. 
And may I remind you, with all due respect, that we are bred as assassins.” </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I do not want the Princess 
killed at this point of time,” Ganondorf said. “But I accept your 
offer of finding the Princess yourself. I trust that you will not designate 
the assignment to anyone else but yourself, of course.” </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I would not think of it,” 
Sheik said, bowing. “If you want the job done correctly…”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“…do it yourself,” Ganondorf 
finished for him and smiled. “Perhaps I ought to follow your advice.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The council members in the 
chamber muttered amongst themselves and shifted noisily in their chairs. 
Many in Ganondorf’s court jealously desired and guarded any favor 
from the Evil King. To see one of such dubious and mysterious character 
asked much of their loyalty to Ganondorf. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Sheik ignored the low chatter 
and bowed. “Only as my liege desires,” he replied. Ganondorf dismissed 
Sheik as well as the motley crew of council members. As soon as the 
last creature left the chamber and the door closed securely behind them, 
Ganondorf motioned to two witches hanging back in a dark corner of the 
council chamber. Floating on their brooms, they flew down to his side 
and leaned forward as Ganondorf whispered his instructions. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Watch him,” he said. The 
witches smiled their acquiescence and silently glided out of the room. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda prepared herself for 
the situation she knew would be grisly to face. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“It’s a job, it’s a job, 
it’s just a job,” she repeated to herself as she walked into what 
was once the Domain of the Zoras – <i>El Dominio 
de las Zoras</i> to most Hylians who could remember the inception of 
a formal home for the Zoras. The prophecy she had studied told of a 
Zora princess that would be the Sage of Waters, but it had been years 
since she had seen this princess in person – she had no idea what 
she would look like. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I just hope that my senses 
lead me in the right direction,” Zelda said, watching her breath crystallize 
into thick clouds. Ganondorf had done something horrible to the home 
of the Zoras, judging by the unusually cold air emanating from the entrance 
to the Zora’s domain. She could only guess at what she might see. 
She took a deep breath and leaped without a sound into the small entrance, 
catching snow on her mask as she ran.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda only thought she was 
mentally prepared. She wasn’t. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda had expected floating 
blocks of ice and dying Zora all about. All free-flowing bodies of water 
were utterly frozen – solid ice every place the eye could reach. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In a flash of desperation, 
she visually searched the area for any Zora while searching with her 
subconscious senses for any sign of life. She felt nothing and jumped 
down carefully onto the former lake, half-hoping that the ice would 
break and water would seep out. <i>It’s just as thick as it looks,</i> 
Zelda thought. <i>No manmade tool could ever break this. This is ice 
created by a powerful evil. </i></font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda’s heart lurched and 
she cried out as she looked below the surface of the ice and saw a Zora, 
frozen in motion. He (or she – it was difficult to distinguish a gender) 
appeared as though he were desperately trying to reach the surface, 
to escape his death. Zelda wondered how Ganondorf had frozen everything 
so immediately and her heart bled for this young Zora, dead before its 
time. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Bloody hell,” Zelda swore. 
She fought the urge to remove the mask upon her face and thus revealing 
her real face. All around her, surrounding her position on the ice, 
were hundreds more Zoras, all permanently frozen in place, all eternally 
struggling to be freed of their icy captivity. Zelda seldom cried – 
she could not afford that kind of time – but she was as close to crying 
as she had been in months. To see these Zoras held captive, even in 
death – Zelda wanted to be sick. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She stepped out of the frozen 
lake and followed a natural path to what imagined was the throne room. 
The sight of the dead Zoras completely unnerved her and she began losing 
hope of finding anyone alive. <i>At this point,</i> Zelda thought, <i>
I’ll be lucky to find any clues as to how to undo all this miserable 
ice. </i>When she reached the throne room, she saw the Zora king, frozen 
solidly onto his throne. <i>In the name of the Gods and Goddesses! </i>
Zelda thought. <i>What lengths will Ganondorf attempt to secure his 
authority? Link, we have to hurry. This is only getting worse…</i> </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In the throne room there were 
also many Zoras frozen underneath the impenetrable ice. As if her heart 
hadn’t broken before, it broke again to see some of the Zoras appearing 
to scramble to protect their leader just before the ice hit. No matter 
where she looked, all she could see were motionless Zoras, sealed inside 
their icy graves. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>It’s impossible to find 
the Sage of Water here,</i> Zelda thought. <i>The Sage to be awakened 
is likely already dead. I came too late. </i></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda turned and began to leave 
the throne room, but a slight motion to her right caught her attention 
and to her horror, she saw a hand and part of an arm above the surface 
of the thick ice. “Oh, Goddesses!” cried Zelda as she skidded across 
the ice in an effort to reach the hand as quickly as she could. She 
almost slipped past it but grabbed onto the arm before she could slide 
away. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>This Zora may still be alive!</i> 
Zelda thought. She looked at the Zora who was attached to the arm and 
hand and saw what appeared to be a female Zora. Her breasts were tall 
and quite bare – in fact, her entire body was bare. Frozen in time, 
the Zora’s long, cerulean blue fins on her hips and heels looked as 
though they could flutter loose any moment. Zelda couldn’t tell immediately 
if the Zora were still alive, but if the earlier, weak motion of the 
hand were any indication, maybe, just maybe…</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda drew out her long, thin 
katana and began chipping away at the ice while casting multiple fire 
spells, being careful not to singe the Zora’s exposed skin. She did 
not know what would happen if a Zora’s skin dried out, let alone if 
bared to too much heat. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It felt like hours after she 
began cracking the ice away and Zelda was ready to scream her frustration. 
She had made excellent progress – in fact, most of the female Zora’s 
torso was out, lying limply on the surface of the ice, breathing shallowly. 
But her hips, legs and feet were still sealed underneath the ice, and 
the melted water kept running into Zelda’s work area so that it became 
difficult to cast the fire spells. She dared not sop up the water with 
any of her clothing – constant activity might keep her warm, but as 
soon as she became still, she ran the possibility of freezing to death. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The Zora was clearly very weak 
and held lightly onto Zelda’s waist as Zelda continued to work, while 
Zelda tried to keep the Zora warm by keeping the Zora in her lap. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda managed to sweep enough 
of the water away to attack another layer of ice, and the Zora’s hips 
were free. Soon after that, enough of her legs were free that Zelda 
could take out the feet and, more gently, the fins attached to the heels. 
She wasn’t sure how sensitive a Zora’s body was to pain, but Zelda 
imagined that she’d be sore in the morning. And so would Zelda – 
she had done a terrific amount of heavy labor in a very short time. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda wrapped the Zora as best 
as she could with her cloak. She hissed through her teeth as she exposed 
her skin to the freezing air. Hoisting the Zora across her shoulders, 
Zelda made her way out of the throne room and out of the Domain as best 
as she could, stumbling occasionally with the dead weight of the Zora 
woman. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>She looks to be nothing 
more than an overgrown fish</i>, Zelda thought to herself as she crawled 
out the entryway hidden underneath the waterfall. <i>And yet, there’s 
something about her face that moves me</i>. Indeed, the female Zora’s 
face seemed reposed in her tentative hold on life. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Finally, Zelda and the Zora 
were free of the Domain. Zelda tumbled into the waiting pool underneath 
and behind the waterfall hiding the entrance to the Domain. She began 
to warm the Zora’s skin, but it proved to be a more difficult task 
than she had anticipated. She chafed her hands and feet, trying to be 
gentle around the delicate fins. When the Zora did not respond for several 
long moments, Zelda almost gave up hope. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Just as she was about to lay 
the Zora aside, her eyes opened halfway and closed again. She did not 
stir, but this tiny sign of life was enough to encourage Zelda’s work. 
She began again, more vigorously than before, working to reawaken  
her cold, clammy skin. <i>Then again,</i> Zelda thought, <i>shouldn’t 
a Zora’s skin be somewhat cold and clammy to begin with?</i></font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When she stirred again, Zelda 
leaned the back of her head against her chest and began rubbing the 
Zora’s body vigorously, not taking care to avoid her prominent breasts 
and hips. Zelda cursed the absence of daylight, but Sheik’s form could 
not operate as efficiently without the darkness of night. Still, it 
would have been nice to have sunlight to help with the warming process. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Perhaps she’s dead after 
all,</i> Zelda thought. Just as she was thinking, the Zora opened her 
eyes completely and pushed her head back against Zelda’s chest to 
peer into Zelda’s face. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“And who might you be?” 
the Zora whispered hoarsely. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I am Sheik of the Sheikah 
tribe,” Zelda replied. She glanced at the Zora woman’s face briefly 
before setting back to work on chafing the Zora’s body, arms and hands.</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto did not make any indication 
that she heard the statement. Zelda felt her shiver with the chilly 
water while she kept her eyes closed. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“To whom do I have the pleasure 
of speaking?” Zelda asked, reflexively checking to be sure that the 
mask to conceal her face was still in place. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The Zora twisted her head around 
onto Zelda’s arm to peer at Zelda. “How can you not know who I am?” 
she asked incredulously. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You Zoras all look alike 
to the rest of us,” Zelda said, the words falling out before she could 
filter them out. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The Zora threw a punch at Zelda’s 
face. Zelda easily blocked it as the Zora was still not in prime fighting 
condition. The Zora kicked at Zelda, but only got halfway to Zelda’s 
head before Zelda pushed it down. Just to be safe, Zelda crossed the 
Zora’s hands over her lower body and pinned the Zora’s legs with 
her own. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You think you’re original, 
don’t you?” the Zora spat after Zelda secured her. “You don’t 
think I’ve heard that repeatedly outside of my home? You are speaking 
to the princess of the house of the Royal Zoras – I am Ruto.”</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>So she is to be the Sage 
of Waters! </i>Zelda thought. <i>Lucky for all of us she’s still alive. </i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I hope that you will not 
to hear those words again, Princess Ruto,” Zelda replied, half-apologetically. 
She indicated the mouth of Zora’s Domain. “I’d say the majority 
of your race is frozen dead up in that ice cave you once called home.” <br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“It still is<i> </i>
my home!” Ruto cried as she covered her eyes. Now Zelda felt embarrassed 
at upsetting the Zora. She couldn’t pinpoint the reason, but just 
being around the Zora princess brought out her worst behaviors. . </font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Princess Ruto, I’m sorry 
I made light of a grave situation,” Zelda apologized. “It wasn’t 
fair of me.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In just the short amount of 
time that Zelda knew Ruto, she had already leaned to expect a sharp 
retort, but this she did not receive. Ruto only covered her eyes and 
breathed long deep breaths. Zelda was mildly pleased that Ruto did not 
struggle to free herself of Zelda’s arms. However, Zelda did not know 
where this feeling of pleasure came from.  </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>All haughtiness aside, she’s 
got a long and potentially terrible road ahead of her,</i> Zelda thought. <i>
She’s just lost most of her race and now she must go on to fulfill 
her duty as Sage. </i></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Princess Ruto, do you know 
why I pulled you out of <i>El Dominio</i>?” Zelda asked. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto looked up at Zelda and 
cracked a smile. “How did you come to learn the old name for my home? 
Only the elderly Hylians would know that,” Ruto asked softly, her 
voice breaking. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto didn’t know it, but 
Zelda immediately understood her revelation as being a crack in Sheik’s 
supposed character. “I am a Sheikah, part of the shadows – the wind 
carries secrets, I discover them,” she replied. She hoped it was an 
adequate answer to keep Ruto’s questions down. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto only held her smile and 
observed Zelda through half-closed eyes. Zelda shifted Ruto in her lap 
and pulled her closer to Zelda’s shoulders. She began chafing Ruto 
again when she asked, “And why did my savior Sheik bring me out of…<i>El 
Dominio</i>?” She asked with a sly angle to her smile. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda ignored the reference. 
“You are the prophesied Sage of Water,” she replied. “I came to 
bring you to Lake Hylia so that you and the Hero Link can purify the 
Temple of Water of Ganondorf’s influence.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Link?!” Ruto cried, sitting 
up straight and twisting about to face Zelda. Zelda couldn’t help 
but feel Ruto’s fins on her hips fluttering about on the inside of 
her legs. It suddenly put her on the path of arousal. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Link, the little boy I met 
when he came for my Sapphire?” Ruto said. “I can’t believe it 
– my Goddesses, but he wouldn’t be a little boy now, would he? It’s 
been seven years – he’s a man by now! Where is he? You must tell 
me!”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I don’t know exactly where 
he is,” Zelda said. “But I can tell you that he is on his way to 
the Water temple, even now. I need to get you to there before he arrives. 
You need to assess the situation and create a plan of action.” </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She slowed her rubbing of the 
Zora’s limbs – Ruto was gradually becoming more active and alert. 
Additionally, Zelda didn’t want to encourage the bit of arousal Ruto 
had already incited in her mind – Ruto’s prolonged stay in Zelda’s 
lap would only increase the odds of further arousal.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Only Ruto seemed quite comfortable 
in Zelda’s lap. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda initially tried gently 
moving Ruto to the side and into the water, citing her desire to see 
Ruto’s skin re-moisturized. But Ruto straightened herself back into 
Zelda’s lap. After that, Zelda did not have the heart to try again. 
She allowed Ruto to stay and tried to ignore the uncomfortable thoughts 
that tumbled about in her mind. Mentally, she slapped herself for thinking 
in such a way. She was in a war, Gods damn it! This wasn’t the time!</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">To Zelda’s horror, she realized 
that her trail of thoughts had required her silence long enough that 
Ruto was staring strangely at her. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Very good then…” Ruto 
said with a silent question in her eyes. “Then start for the Temple?”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Absolutely,” Zelda replied, 
quickly standing up and ejecting Ruto from her lap. Ruto recovered quickly 
and submerged her body in the water. Zelda watched, mesmerized at the 
reclining position Ruto briefly took in the water, zipping fluidly about. 
Zelda rejoiced that Ruto seemed to be recovered but she was deeply bothered 
that</font><font size="1" face="Times New Roman">  Ruto’s f</font><font size="3" 
face="Times New Roman">luid, twisting movements only brought 
further arousal to her. Her motions made her recall  the old wives’ 
tales repeated by countless mouths, meant to terrify teenaged girls 
just beginning to feel the effects of sexual awareness; stories of young 
girls and old women raped by evil tentacles sprouting from the sea, 
made from the debauchery and collective sins of the people they tormented. <i>
I don’t believe that those stories have helped matters regarding Hylian 
prejudices against the Zoras,</i> Zelda thought. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Though Zelda would have readily 
admitted to buying into many of those same prejudices, she was more 
acutely aware of them than most Hylians, to her credit.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto surfaced and held out 
her arms for Zelda. Zelda only stood in shock.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Unless you’re as good 
as or a better swimmer than I, I will offer you the chance to hold onto 
my back as we swim to Lake Hylia,” Ruto said. “In any case, I <i>
know </i>I’m a stronger swimmer than you are.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda immediately recognized 
Ruto’s kindness – a princess of the autonomous Royal Zora house 
was offering herself as little more than a buggy ride. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Princess Ruto,” Zelda 
said. “You are deeply gracious—“ before Ruto interjected. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Oh, Goddesses, do not mention 
it! I’m only passing on a kindness that was once given to me,” she 
interrupted with an audacious wink. Zelda felt a blush curling up in 
her cheeks and spreading to her scalp and ears. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Well then…by your leave,” 
Zelda said and met Ruto’s arms with her own. Ruto pulled Zelda’s 
arms securely around her shoulders, gave Zelda a moment to gather and 
hold her breath, and then darted under the surface, streaking through 
the water more quickly than Zelda could have imagined. </font></p>
