<h1>The Hidden Waters of the Heart (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../zelda/index.html">Legend of Zelda</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/missleanne.html">Diane "Miss Leanne" Taylor</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../zelda/hiddenwaters-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a>  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It wasn’t a very eventful 
trip, especially not since it was a journey by night. The only interesting 
thing Zelda heard or saw was the few occasions when Ruto rattled her 
tongue loudly at schools of passing fish. Zelda could only guess what 
Ruto was communicating to them. <i>If only some regular Hylian citizen 
could see this,</i> Zelda thought. <i>I can’t begin to imagine the 
insults they would hurl her way. </i></font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda still felt badly for 
her earlier jab at Princess Ruto. <i>I’m disturbed at how quickly 
that fell out</i>, Zelda thought. <i>How on earth can I call myself 
a fair ruler if I can’t lay aside racial stereotypes?</i> </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda suddenly remembered that 
she wasn’t a ruler anymore – at least, not in this world ruled by 
Ganondorf. <i>Does he really believe that I am Sheik?</i> Zelda thought. <i>
Does he have any hint as to my true identity?</i> </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda squeezed her eyes shut. 
She did not want to confront the thoughts roiling in her mind. She tried 
to concentrate on other things and found herself focused once again 
upon Ruto. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Frankly, I’m stunned that 
Ruto was able to recover that quickly and take on such a difficult task,</i> 
Zelda thought.<i> I’m the weight and size of a small man and yet she 
practically </i>flits<i> through the water</i>. <i>And upstream, no 
less!</i> </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As Ruto arced her body out 
of the water and into the air, Zelda had the chance to take another 
deep breath just before Ruto dove back in. Zelda was struck by the Zora 
girl’s courtesy – she leapt out on a frequent and regular basis; 
Zelda did not have to remind Ruto even once. Several times, however, 
Zelda nearly lost her grip on the Zora’s shoulders as Ruto pounced 
out of the water and into the air. Each time, Ruto brought her arms 
around and knitted her hands together behind Zelda’s bottom to secure 
her. Zelda became acutely aware of Ruto’s touch, even though Zelda 
felt sure that sensuality was the furthest thing from Ruto’s mind. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The river began to narrow. 
“We’re almost there,” Ruto shouted in a voice-filtered by water. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Good!” Zelda shouted back 
once Ruto momentarily leaped out of the water. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda’s heart was beginning 
to pound painfully against her ribcage and in her ears, despite Ruto’s 
care. She would need a rest, and soon. <i>For the love of Din,</i> Zelda 
thought with chagrin, <i>I thought I was in better condition than this. </i></font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">At last, the river suddenly 
widened and a long waterfall dumped Ruto and Zelda into the enormous 
lake of Hyrule, Lake Hylia. When they reached the bottom of the waterfall 
and Ruto regained her bearings, Ruto poked her head above the surface 
and swam more casually. She boosted Zelda further up her back with her 
hands tightly holding Zelda’s buttocks. Zelda tried to take her mind 
off of Ruto’s hands and listen to what she said. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You didn’t tell me the 
Lake was as low as it is, Mr. Sheik.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Indeed, the Lake was several 
dozen feet below the normal level. “It seems that the Lake has changed 
since my last visit,” Zelda replied. She slipped off Ruto’s back 
and treaded water, swimming around to face Ruto.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto took a deep breath and 
rubbed her nose in concentration. “Have I got my work cut out for 
me?” Ruto asked. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I think so,” Zelda replied. 
Both gazed into the furthest depths of the Lake at the entrance to the 
Temple of Water. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto swam around, staying above 
the surface and pushing forward to the entrance of the Temple of Water. 
Zelda followed close behind her. Clearly, something would need to be 
done with the gate that blocked the entrance to the Temple. It appeared 
that it hadn’t been used in several years and thus, seemed to be rather 
rusted over. Ruto and Zelda studied the gate, each silently formulating 
their own plans as to how to get inside. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Suddenly, something behind 
the two leapt up from the water into the air and dove back under. Neither 
one of them were able to get a good look at the leaping object. Ruto 
and Zelda almost clawed the skin off one another as they scrambled out 
of the water, using the ancient, broken bridge as a landing shore. Ruto 
shrieked a long string of obscenities in the Zoran tongue while Zelda 
tried to scan the water for a sign of the swimming object.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“What in the name of all 
things holy was that?!” Ruto cried.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Bloody hell if I know,” 
Zelda swore. The object had severely startled her and her fear manifested 
itself through irritation. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Well, you’re the man – 
get in there and find out!” Ruto commanded. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You’re the better swimmer 
– get in there and find out first,” Zelda retorted. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“We’ll both go back in,” 
Ruto said and grabbed her right hand, causing the guard on Zelda’s 
wrist to dislodge. Zelda felt the damage and gasped. Quickly, she jerked 
her hand out of Ruto’s and repaired the guard as best as she could 
without unwrapping the bandages holding the guard in place. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“What’s the matter now?” 
Ruto asked. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Nothing, it just got moved 
to the side,” Zelda replied. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto turned out to be more 
intuitive than Zelda had bargained for. “What are you hiding, Sheik?” 
Ruto asked, not missing a beat. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Just because I’m wearing 
a facemask doesn’t mean I’m hiding anything from you,” Zelda said 
pointedly. “I’m just hiding from <i>him.</i>” </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Him – Ganondorf?” Ruto 
asked in a low voice. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Yes, but what good person 
isn’t hiding from him?” Zelda said.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“The Sheikah haven’t been 
seen in a public setting in decades,” Ruto replied. “I would think 
it would be most natural for you and what remains of your people to 
hide. It isn’t so natural for the rest of us.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda placed her hand back 
into Ruto’s to avoid the implication that Zelda disliked her. Ruto 
took a few steps out into the water and suddenly looked at Zelda with 
an unsettled and pained face. “Do you think my people will survive 
the freezing of Zora’s Domain?” Ruto asked. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>I…didn’t see any indication 
of life other than you,</i> Zelda thought. But she replied, “I don’t 
know…I hope that some will be alive.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto’s face did not change 
as she looked down from Zelda’s face. For no particular reason and 
despite the situation, Zelda suddenly noted that there was not a single 
sound of nature anywhere within earshot. No chirping birds, no buzzing 
bugs, no fish leaping in and out of the lake, nothing. As if the much-lowered 
lake weren’t a clear enough indication, this absence of regular noise 
was more than confirmation that something evil had taken hold of the 
Water Temple below the surface of Lake Hylia. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda pulled on Ruto’s hand. 
“Come on now,” Zelda said as gently as she could. “The sooner 
we rid the Temple of this evil influence, the sooner we can leave.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Perhaps…that thing that 
jumped around was part of that influence?” Ruto asked uncertainly. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Maybe,” Zelda said, not 
sure at all of the leaping objects’ moral affiliation. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto lead the way into the 
water and they raised their heads above the surface, being as quiet 
as possible so they could anticipate the object’s return. After several 
moments they heard something suddenly break the surface behind them. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto spun around more quickly 
than Zelda’s eyes could register. “If you are a part of the curse 
that Ganondorf has placed upon this lake, get the <i>hell out</i>!” 
Ruto screamed as she whirled to face the danger. “This is <i>my </i>
lake – I am the ruler of the Zoras as long as I draw breath!”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda and Ruto looked upon 
a Zora, very similar in bodily nature to Ruto. It was immediately clear 
that he was terrified at Ruto’s display of aggression. Only his eyes 
were above the surface – everything else was submerged for a quick 
getaway, if he needed it. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>That was anti-climatic,</i> 
Zelda thought as she pushed her hair back in relief. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto swam up beside the teenaged 
Zora, or so he appeared to Zelda. “Nobuyuki!” Ruto cried. “You 
weren’t inside <i>El Dominio</i> when it froze over, praise Farore!”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Nobuyuki shook his head. “I 
was out gathering food for dinner with my family before that man in 
black came to <i>Dominio</i> – he’s frozen everything, Your Majesty! 
Even the entrance to get back in<i>,</i>” he said. </font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In spite of the young Zora’s 
anxious grief, Zelda could not help but be struck by his beautiful dark 
eyes and intricately patterned skin. He was the second Zora she had 
seen over the last few hours and she wondered if all of them were this 
naturally beautiful. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda snapped back to the conversation 
at hand. “Do not go back to <i>Dominio</i> until it is unfrozen,” 
she heard Ruto direct Nobuyuki. “If your family is nearby, I shall 
give them the same warning. <i>El Dominio</i> is still under Ganondorf’s 
curse. In fact, I was frozen under the ice and if it weren’t for this 
man Sheik” – here Ruto indicated Zelda – “I would not be alive.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Nobuyuki bowed deeply to Zelda. 
“Our Princess Ruto is precious to our people,” he said. “We will 
be forever indebted to you for your kindness and sacrifice.”</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda bowed in return, humbled 
by the young Zora’s respect. As she straightened, Zelda felt a large 
amount of water being pushed aside somewhere close to her feet and legs. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Besides your family,” 
Ruto said, “who else is with you in Lake Hylia?” </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Sadao is here,” Nobuyuki 
said, “and Teruo is here with his wife and family as well as Daisuke 
and his girlfriend.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Is that all,” Ruto asked. 
“Surely there are more who were here before Ganondorf cursed <i>El 
Dominio</i>?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I’m afraid not, Your Majesty,” 
Nobuyuki replied. “There may be more who got out and who are in some 
other parts of the river, but I did not see any more besides those in 
the Lake.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto turned to Zelda, a look 
of devastation on her face. “Only thirteen of us remain…how can 
the Hylian Zoras survive?” she whispered. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda felt another strong underwater 
current and heard a low <i>swish</i>. She spared a glance backwards 
but saw nothing.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Could other Zoras from other 
countries be allowed into Hyrule to help us rebuild <i>El Dominio</i>?” 
Nobuyuki asked. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“It may be our only choice, 
if thirteen is our final number,” Ruto said.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Pardon me for asking, Your 
Majesty,” Nobuyuki began. “But who is to marry the Princess Ruto, 
considering this disaster?”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda turned her full attention 
to Ruto. Ruto appeared thoughtful as she gazed up into the sky. “Do 
not concern yourself – I am engaged. Last I heard, he was still alive 
and well.” Zelda felt a mild shock run through her body at this news. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Please allow me to speak 
on my family’s behalf: we rejoice in your engagement and look forward 
to your continued reign,” Nobuyuki said, bowing once more. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda wanted to ask Ruto who 
her fiancée was, but by then, the barracuda bit into her leg and rapidly 
pulled her down to the floor of the Lake.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Immediately, she was amazed 
at the sheer size of the creature. Eight feet long and three feet wide 
and equipped with an enormous mouth lined with sharp teeth. The barracuda 
had a demonic gleam in its orange eyes and Zelda struggled as hard as 
she could to dislodge herself from the barracuda’s mouth. Clouds of 
blood rose around Zelda and she tried to sweep them away to get a better 
view of the creature, but in vain. The barracuda continued to drag her 
further down. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda punched the barracuda’s 
nostrils but it seemed to have little effect. Zelda felt her oxygen 
level rapidly become depleted, so she resorted to grabbing her stiletto-thin 
throwing knives and burying two into the barracuda’s nose. It thrashed 
wildly and more clouds of blood obscured Zelda’s sight. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda continued to stab at 
the barracuda’s mouth and at last, it released her. Zelda began swimming 
up to the surface, excruciatingly aware of the damage in her leg. Just 
when she almost reached the surface, barely enough to take a breath 
of air, the barracuda bit her arm and pulled her back under. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Purely on reflex, Zelda began 
to scream for Ruto’s aid, but the water rushed into her mouth and 
lungs – Zelda, still in the disguise of Sheik, was almost finished. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The moment Ruto realized Zelda 
was gone and far beneath the surface of the water, Ruto  procured 
Nobuyuki’s spear and quickly dived under the surface, searching for 
Sheik. She spotted him struggling for his life amid bloody plumes. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Gods damn it, of all the 
things it could have been, it’s a barracuda,</i> Ruto thought as she 
streaked towards the battle. She watched as Sheik managed to free his 
leg from the barracuda’s jaws and almost achieved the surface’s 
relief. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto readied her spear for 
the barracuda and almost threw it when the creature gained hold of Sheik 
once more. She couldn’t throw the spear without the risk of hurting 
Sheik, so she kicked her legs and arms and plunged down, following the 
scene of battle. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">By now, Sheik’s entire right 
side was exposed, his gashes leaked blood and he no longer fought with 
the power he had before. The moment Ruto had her target, she pulled 
her arm back and threw the spear with all the strength she had. The 
spear lodged itself in the barracuda’s eye and Ruto shoved the spear 
in further. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The barracuda immediately released 
Sheik and Ruto snatched his limp body up. She grabbed Sheik by the waist 
and swam directly for the entrance to the Water Temple – it was their 
closest haven. Smashing the gate key with her fist, she swam in with 
Sheik draped over her shoulder. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Quickly kicking the opposing 
gate key to shut the gate, Ruto hoisted Sheik up onto the high threshold 
of the Temple. It was clear that Sheik’s injuries were grave indeed 
– clear, because most of his clothing was torn off. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Please breathe, please breathe!” 
Ruto shouted at Sheik. Tearing off his mask, she pushed upwards on his 
diaphragm to force the water in his lungs out. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto smacked her mouth onto 
Sheik’s, blew into his mouth as hard as she could and continued to 
apply sharp pressure to his stomach. After a few rounds, Ruto ascertained 
that Sheik wasn’t recovering quickly enough. Tearing off the rest 
of Sheik’s shirt, she hoped it would allow for more breathing room. 
What greeted Ruto’s eyes was not the masculine pectorals she expected 
– rather, a set of feminine breasts. She looked at Sheiks’ face 
and saw at once that “Sheik” was no longer Sheik, but rather a woman 
with delicate facial features and soaked, yet long, hair. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Momentarily putting the confusion 
out of her mind, she pushed as hard as she could on the woman’s stomach 
one last time before the woman began coughing up the water and rolled 
onto her stomach. When the woman placed her palms on the ground to steady 
herself, Ruto saw the clearest sign of the woman’s identity on her 
right hand – the Triforce emblazoned upon the back of her hand.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You – I should have known!” 
Ruto cried. “You are Zelda!”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda crawled on her hands 
and knees to the wall, groaning with each motion and sat against the 
wall. Ruto noticed Zelda’s breasts looked bigger when she was sitting 
up straight. Apparently, Zelda did not feel the need for modesty any 
longer, for she did not make any attempt to cover herself. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She slowly, painfully replaced 
the stiletto knives back into the pack attached to her good leg and 
pulled out a blue solution in a tightly corked bottle from the pack 
below the first. She used her left hand to sip the solution while grasping 
her torn cloth with her right – she was in a tremendous amount of 
pain, but she did not look at Ruto directly.  </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Princess Zelda!” Ruto 
exclaimed, still stunned. “I don’t believe it! How long have you 
been hiding like this?”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Seven years,” Zelda replied 
briefly. She hoped the internal healing solution would take effect sooner 
than was typical. Not only was she in monstrous pain, she was well aware 
that to stay in one place for long meant certain discovery. Zelda did 
not see herself being able to move efficiently with these wounds. And 
now, one more person knew who she was. She was in a very precarious 
situation, indeed. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Seven years I have been 
running and trying to save my people from Ganondorf. Running to save 
a world already lost,” she said, looking to Ruto. Her face was still 
one of utter amazement. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Don’t say that, Princess,” 
Ruto said with a new tone of voice. “There’s still hope. There’s 
always hope left, even when things look bleakest. Link’s on his way 
– you said so yourself, and now you’ve got me.” Ruto grinned at 
Zelda. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I do,” said Zelda. “But 
my actions have been careless enough that...” she trailed off, shaking 
her head. “If Ganondorf finds out who I am,” she continued, “we 
stand to lose all we’ve worked for to bring him down. And for the 
love of Din, I cannot stop hurting…” </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">To her utter embarrassment 
and shame, Zelda began crying. She was exhausted, she was in horrendous 
pain, she was close to despair and she saw only more mountains to climb 
before Ganondorf’s defeat. Ruto pulled Zelda down into her lap, caressed 
her arms and pressed her lips to her forehead. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Things are always darkest 
just before the dawn,” Ruto said softly. “But there is no time for 
fear.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda understood the motivation 
behind Ruto’s words, but couldn’t fathom the reason behind her intimate 
touch. Again, in spite of the situation, Zelda couldn’t help but feel 
the sensuality rising up and wondered if Ruto knew precisely what she 
was doing. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You probably don’t remember, 
but do you know that I’ve already met you?” Ruto asked. Zelda faced 
Ruto in surprise. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Remember when your father 
and my father met in <i>El Dominio</i> to settle on a compromise over 
the Rights of Water treaty?” Ruto said while uncorking the bottle 
of  healing solution and dripping a few drops into Zelda’s mouth. 
Zelda gratefully swallowed the liquid. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I remember, but only barely,” 
Zelda replied. “So that was you? Obviously, I wouldn’t recognize 
you.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I’d hope so,” Ruto said. 
“You and I were only three years at the time. When I first saw you 
walking in with your father, I couldn’t help but love your little 
blonde curls and your pink skin. Up until that point, I only saw Zoras 
and their blue skin – you and your father were the first Hylians I 
ever saw.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I confess,” said Zelda, 
“I don’t remember much of that particular encounter. I only remember 
lots of water and what looked like tall blue fish that walked around.” 
Ruto raised her eyebrows. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“But I was young and influenced 
by what Hylians sometimes say if the subject of Zoras come up,” Zelda 
said quickly. She did not want a repeat performance of their earlier 
racial discussion. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“And what did those Hylians 
say?” Ruto asked.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda would have rather not 
said, especially not since she and Ruto had already formed a tentative 
bond. “They said that you smelled like…like fish,” Zelda said 
hesitantly. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto sighed. “And now that 
you are lying in the lap of a Zora, do you smell any hint of fish on 
me?” she asked. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I’m sorry; I can only 
smell blood at this point,” Zelda said very quietly, “as well as 
this musty threshold. When was the last time anyone came through here? 
It doesn’t feel like this has been crossed since its construction.”</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Only Zoras can come in easily,” 
Ruto replied. “The only reason you were able to come in is because 
the water level is too low and you were already halfway there.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Ah,” Zelda said before 
she relaxed in Ruto’s lap and closed her eyes. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">They allowed a brief reign 
of silence before Ruto said, “Ever since I met you, I’ve liked you 
very much.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Is that the reason behind 
your earlier kiss?” Zelda asked, quite curious to know. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I…just wanted to feel 
your skin,” Ruto confessed, blushing a mild pink. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda closed her eyes again 
and concentrated on breathing the healing finally taking place in her 
leg and arm. Her eyes flicked open when she felt Ruto’s hands tracing 
the bottom of her breasts. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I just want to feel,” 
Ruto said when Zelda began to protest. “You’re the second Hylian 
I’ve touched since I was hatched.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda was surprised – she 
did not feel uncomfortable with Ruto’s explorations. It felt perfectly 
natural but also served to increase her arousal. She hoped Ruto wouldn’t 
notice her burning face which she was sure was quite red. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Who is the first Hylian 
whom you’ve touched?” Zelda couldn’t help but ask. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Link, my fiancée,” Ruto 
said off-handedly. Zelda sat up and turned around to face Ruto. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Link is your fiancée?!” 
Zelda exclaimed. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Indeed,” Ruto replied. 
“I mentioned him while talking with Nobuyuki, remember?”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You mentioned the engagement, 
you did not mention Link as your fiancée,” Zelda replied.  <br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Oh, well, it’s not something 
I’d like everyone to know,” Ruto said casually. “Inter-special 
marriage is not something that’s encouraged.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“But,” Zelda began, “he 
belongs to me – I am the one with whom he belongs, not you!”</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Who says we can’t share 
him?” Ruto said, grinning.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“We can’t, not really and—“ 
Zelda sputtered.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“For heaven’s sake, Zelda,” 
Ruto interrupted, laughing. “I engaged myself to him when I was ten 
years old. I doubt Link was aware of it at the time, my father never 
knew and I’ve got my place as the Water’s Sage. Do you truly think 
that I can fulfill an engagement with Link?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda muttered in a low tone. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“All the same, I’d like 
to experience love with a Hylian, however briefly,” Ruto said, laying 
Zelda back down into her lap. “It’s remarkably delightful to engage 
in taboo behavior, especially while the whole world shakes their collective 
fist at you, don’t you think?” Zelda only stared up at Ruto. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“In answer to your earlier 
question,” Ruto said, “I’ve always liked you very much. I’d 
listen for any news of your doings during my childhood, any at all. 
When Ganondorf took over Hyrule, I was sick with worry for you – I’ve 
always wondered what happened. And here you are, safe and sound <i>and</i> 
in my lap!”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda smiled weakly and, not 
knowing what else to do, gave a playful salute. “Ach, what was that?” 
Ruto asked, poking Zelda’s breast. “Aren’t we beyond formal greetings?”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“It seems we are,” Zelda 
replied. Or tried to. Ruto chose that very moment to lean down and plant 
a firm kiss on Zelda’s lips. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Why thank you!” Ruto exclaimed 
gleefully. “My first kiss with a Hylian.”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda had no idea what to do. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Are you certain you will 
be alright?” Zelda asked Ruto.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I believe I should ask you 
that question,” Ruto said playfully. Ruto was still quite gleeful 
after her stolen kiss from Zelda. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I’ll be fine – I’m 
not the one who must meet the monster that reigns here,” Zelda said. </font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“No indeed,” Ruto replied. 
“But you must meet Ganondorf himself one day and in your true identity 
as Zelda.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I doubt that day will belong 
much to me at all,” Zelda said under her breath, not meaning for Ruto 
to hear. However, she did not count on Ruto’s razor-sharp hearing. 
Ruto was preparing to dive into the deepest part of the Temple and wait 
for Link, but she turned around and drew close to Zelda and squeezed 
her shoulders. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“It <i>will</i> belong to 
you. The victory will be just as much yours as it will be his. Depend 
on it,” Ruto said with strength in her voice. It made Zelda want to 
touch her beyond just a simple kiss – Ruto was strong, stronger than 
Zelda herself felt. Ruto had nothing to hide; she simply was who she 
was. Zelda lusted after that confidence. A sensual spark between herself 
and Ruto was born. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda relished the strong muscles 
in Ruto’s hands which squeezed her shoulders as well as the sensation 
of Ruto’s breasts pressing against her back, though she wanted Ruto’s 
hands upon her own once more (Zelda still didn’t understand why Ruto 
decided to touch them – she understood the attraction Ruto had for 
her, but it had been years since they had seen each other last). </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Dawn is quickly approaching 
and I’ve spent too much time here,” Zelda said, gathering a thick 
robe about her and pinning it so that it would not easily fall apart. 
“Do you know what to do?”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Wait for Link – how difficult 
can it be?” Ruto retorted playfully.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda simply nodded and buckled 
her leg pouches to her good leg. Her injuries had mostly healed thanks 
to the healing potion, but there would be stiffness present for a few 
hours longer. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I suspect you will have 
to fight off a monster or two before he arrives,” Zelda said. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto leaned over the lip of 
the threshold and peered down into the water’s depths. “Probably,” 
she snorted. “But what are small fry to me? I’ve already cooked 
one fish this evening.” Ruto grinned and flipped her heel and hip 
fins about. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“And I’m eternally grateful 
to you,” Zelda said, finally prepared for her departure. She began 
to wrap her mask around her face when Ruto took three quick steps up 
to Zelda. Zelda was surprised at the Zora woman’s sudden closeness. 
When she saw Ruto leaning towards her mouth, she knew it was coming, 
but there was no desire to resist. She opened herself to Ruto’s lips 
and savored the kiss for all its worth. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“That’s for good luck,” 
Ruto said when they parted. “Good luck to us both.”</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“We’ll both need it,” 
Zelda said. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda turned to leave, tightly 
binding the facemask into place. She had just hit the gate switch and 
opened the gate when Ruto said, “Will we see each other again?”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Without turning to face her, 
Zelda replied, “We will see each other again when it is time to seal 
Ganondorf…somewhere. I do not yet know where he will be sealed.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I mean, before then,” 
Ruto said. “Can we see each other before he is sealed? After this 
temple is healed?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda took a deep breath and 
turned to face Ruto. “I give you my word,” Zelda said. “We will 
meet again after the Water Temple is healed from its curse. That is, 
unless I’m dead and therefore unable to fulfill my promise.”</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto grinned. “Don’t die, 
then,” she said. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda smiled and watched Ruto 
leap into the depths of the Temple’s lake. Then she slid into the 
waters and out of the Temple. Quickly sealing the Temple with the gate 
once more, she swam with as much energy as her limbs could give her, 
not wanting to tangle with the barracuda again. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When she reached the shore, 
she couldn’t help but look back at the underwater temple and wonder 
if Ruto would stay in good condition by the time Link arrived to help 
her. Thinking of Ruto and Link made Zelda wonder if Ruto were truly 
japing about their engagement as young children. Zelda also wondered 
if there were any feelings between Link and Ruto, or if they were one-sided 
on Ruto’s part. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda did not have much time 
to think. She would need to get to safe shelter and quickly if she were 
to avoid the exposure of daylight. The Temple and Ruto’s presence 
might have kept her safe temporarily, but there was the distinct possibility 
of news returning to Ganondorf of her whereabouts. <i>I need to be as 
much of a wandering nomad as possible,</i> Zelda thought. <i>For my 
safety, for Ruto’s, for Link’s quest and for the future of Hyrule. </i></font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda pulled Sheik’s mask 
tighter about her mouth and began to run back to the frozen Zora’s 
Domain. The Hero still needed the keys to purify the Water Temple </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto sank to the floor of the 
Water Temple before she began moving her limbs and using her conveniently 
placed fins to propel herself through the clear, cold water. <i>Funny,</i> 
Ruto thought to herself as she made a quick perimeter around the bottom 
of the floor. <i>For an enemy-infested area, I would have imagined many 
more monsters and a little more…dramatically </i>
colored<i> water. Where are the dark, murky depths you hear of in the 
stories? Where are the monstrous fish waiting to take a bite out of 
unaware visitors?</i></font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">However, Ruto knew better than 
to dismiss the odd feeling that someone or something had their eyes 
trained upon her, watching her every move and filing away mental notes 
to use for their own benefit. These would not be Ganondorf’s monsters; 
they relied far too much on their leader for their instructions. No, 
this was an entirely different creature that she felt watching her – 
much more intelligent, much more calculating. A cunning shadow, indeed.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The object that projected Ruto’s 
feeling of uneasiness did not physically manifest. Ruto felt its malevolence, 
but it was an evil that was not aimed at her. <i>Still, </i>
Ruto thought, <i>I have no doubt that it would sweep me aside if I got 
in its path.</i> It unnerved her that she didn’t know where this shimmer 
of fearful anticipation came from. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Satisfied that none of Ganondorf’s 
monsters present had an interest in her, she found a cozy alcove just 
under the surface of the water in the Temple to briefly rest in. </font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>I guess I’ll just have 
to wait for Mr. Grownup Link,</i> she thought. It irked her that she 
would have to play the role of stereotypical princess and wait for male 
help instead of blazing ahead and making headway on her own, but this 
wasn’t a job for one person. Link would need her help just as much 
as she needed his.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto shifted her body to a 
more comfortable position. Her mind returned to Zelda’s initial reaction 
at Ruto’s announcement of her engagement to Link. When she spoke to 
Nobuyuki on the surface, she ignored Zelda’s obvious surprise, but 
once they were in the relative safety of the Water Temple, Ruto couldn’t 
help but gently goad Zelda to get a reaction. <i>And boy, did I ever,</i> 
Ruto thought. Just from hearing Zelda’s defense of Link, she strongly 
suspected that Zelda held a higher regard for Link than she would like 
to be exposed. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto examined her own feelings 
towards Link, carefully rehashing every spoken word during their initial 
meeting as children inside Jabu-Jabu. After that initial meeting, she 
had forced Link to carry her all around on his back and shoulders; no 
small feat for any person, let alone for a child. <i>I behaved like 
a little brat to him,</i> Ruto thought. <i>Does he remember any of that?</i></font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Still, she couldn’t say that 
she didn’t have a certain regard for Link – just not the same type 
that Zelda was so protective of. She and Link had spent some amount 
of time together, but when they were children, she sent him off and 
away with much teasing and many sarcastic comments. However, Ruto recalled 
thinking of Link’s safety when he left Zora’s Domain. The world 
was so big and dark against a little kid like him and yet there he went 
with his sword (<i>more like a long knife,</i> Ruto thought) and his 
wooden shield. There was nothing to protect him from instant death if 
he was to run up against a monster even twice his size, and yet he fought 
on. She couldn’t help but admire such “gumption.” <br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto wondered what he looked 
like after having seven years to grow. He was fairly cute as a kid, 
but she was curious to see what kind of craftsman time would prove to 
be.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto felt the cool motion of 
the Temple’s inner currents float and sway her fins and the feeling 
lulled her into a deep relaxation – she was very weary. The day had 
arrived and she had always preferred sleeping during the day. Swimming 
with Zelda – or Sheik – on her back for several miles and fighting 
a mutant barracuda had worn her out. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto’s eyelids began to relax 
and drop. Finally, she dozed lightly and slipped into a heavier sleep.</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Some time later, she felt the 
currents of the water of the Temple suddenly intensify. She opened her 
eyes to see Link – his clothing style hadn’t changed much from when 
she knew him as a child – treading water and floating close to her 
alcove. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Or at least, she thought it 
was Link – the face she remembered from her childhood was vastly changed 
and bore little resemblance to his child’s face. He was much…<i>longer,</i> 
Ruto thought. His limbs looked ungainly and even thinner than befits 
a warrior, but Ruto recognized the Master Sword strapped to his back. 
It was something she heard about in legend only – she couldn’t believe 
that he actually <i>carried</i> the thing. And he had exchanged that 
flimsy wooden excuse for a shield for a massive one of steel. <i>Wonderful,</i> 
Ruto thought. <i>He’s a real man, a real soldier!</i></font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto got up and swam up to 
him until their eyes met. She greeted him with, “I’ve been waiting 
for you.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Well, here I am,” Link 
replied and smiled. Such a devastating smile. <i>I would bet you gather 
the girls around you with no problems, </i>
Ruto thought as she smiled back.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She saw, and felt, Link’s 
eyes making their way slowly down her body. He wasn’t the only one 
who changed over seven years, and she would readily admit a certain 
amount of pride in her body’s shape. <i>But he doesn’t need to be 
that blatant!</i> Ruto thought. She smacked her fists onto her hips. </font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“We have little time, Link,” 
she said. “I’ve waited seven years for our engagement to be fulfilled 
and I’d rather not wait any longer. So by your leave...” She meant 
it as a joke – she had always been super bossy as a child. But Link’s 
response stunned her.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I agree,” he replied. 
“Seven years is too long to wait.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto cocked her head and emitted 
an “Eh?” just before Link paddled forward, took her face into his 
hands and kissed her full on the mouth. Ruto was shocked but didn’t 
have the power in her muscles to pull away. His lips felt as good as 
he looked – soft, full and warm. <i>If this is a dream,</i> Ruto thought, <i>
I don’t want to ever wake up</i>.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto responded by deepening 
their kiss and put her arms around Link’s shoulders. To her, kisses 
were perhaps the most loving things a couple could do. It was one thing 
to stick private parts into the receiving lover’s, but a kiss involved 
the face. For the beloved to admit her lover into such an intimate space 
provided a feeling of closeness that Ruto did not feel could be achieved 
as well with other forms of affection.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When Link slid his tongue into 
her mouth, Ruto audibly groaned and felt a vague heating in her groin 
that she ached to rub. Link’s hands circled around her waist and crossed 
down onto her lower back. Ruto held Link as closely to her body as she 
could. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The question she wanted to 
ask pressed her mind. “Where have you been?” Ruto queried. “Couldn’t 
you have at least come to see your fiancée every once in a while?” <br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I wish I could have,” 
Link replied. “But I was…unavoidably detained.” </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">He began palming her peaked 
and heavy breasts. The contact of his rough and calloused hands against 
her sensitive breasts was almost too much to bear, as if she were about 
to hit a higher level she was not quite prepared to achieve. On reflex, 
she grabbed Link’s hand and brought it to her groin, rubbing it against 
the front of her vulva and down to her sensitive opening. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Like this,” she whispered 
and Link laughed lightly. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">At first, Ruto wondered if 
he were laughing at her, but heard the tone of his laughter and decided 
that he wasn’t making fun of her; rather, he was laughing with joy. 
Ruto smiled and placed his head upon her neck and he rested there. A 
moment later, Link drew his head up – but he was no longer Link. Ruto 
stared with shock into the eyes of Princess Zelda. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The blue eyes were still blue 
but they carried a softness Link’s did not have. Zelda’s dark blonde 
hair plumed in the currents of the water, the lights’ reflection in 
the water and tiny bubbles resting on her served to enhance her pale 
pink skin. To Ruto, she seemed to bear an otherworldly, glowing haze 
. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda continued to rub at Ruto’s 
most sensitive place. Ruto stopped Zelda’s hand and whispered hoarsely, 
“Why?”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I’ve loved you longer 
than he’s loved you,” Zelda said, with begging in her eyes, <i>Please 
let me stay with you</i>. <i>Please. </i></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Zelda slipped her hand from 
Ruto’s grasp and began sliding her fingers between Ruto’s outer 
nether lips. Faster they went, and Ruto found herself rushing upon her 
climax. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A loud noise sounded behind 
Ruto and she looked around to see what it was. Her eyes tried to pierce 
the murky underwater darkness – now<i> it chooses to arrive,</i> Ruto 
thought – but she could not see anything that would give away the 
source of the noise. Zelda’s fingers continued to stimulate Ruto.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Zelda…could you…hold…” 
Ruto said, but Zelda was no longer there. Ruto had come to an aching 
peak without climaxing, without Zelda’s presence and without any aid 
to counteract the possible enemy.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The noise sounded again and 
Ruto began to slowly wake. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">~~~</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In the space between her dream 
and reality, Ruto sleepily realized that Zelda’s hand was in fact, 
hers. However, it did not stop her. She rubbed her vulva slowly at first, 
building the stimulation she created in the dream. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When the noise did not come 
again immediately, Ruto rubbed harder, feeling the impending climax, 
spreading her legs as wide as they could manage and palming her nipple 
back and forth in time to her circular strokes on her vulva. The image 
of Zelda’s delicate skin burned itself in Ruto’s imagination. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>That girl…she won’t 
get out of my mind,</i> Ruto thought. <i>Zelda 
– in my dreams and in my daily existence, she’s there. </i>
Ruto stroked herself more insistently. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Zelda, when did you creep 
into my heart like this</i>? She thought. <i>I don’t recall giving 
you permission to haunt me this way</i>. Seeing Zelda’s pink breasts 
crisscrossed with light blue veins bottom parts in her brain threatened 
to drive her mad. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto opened her mouth in a 
silent cry as she drew painfully close to her climax.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">However, Ruto did not achieve 
her peak. A loud metallic <i>CLUNK </i>
and a crash sounded in the depths of the Water Temple . </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The ache in her groin for satisfaction 
was practically unavoidable, but the noise scared Ruto. She quickly 
rolled out of her alcove and swam towards the sound. In her dream, the 
noise occurred at random moments, but now it was a constant, regularly 
intervallic noise – <i>clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk 
– a</i>s though someone were stomping on a metallic surface.</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The noise tattooed itself through 
the conductive waters and seemed to be coming from the floor of the 
Temple. Ruto swam as quickly and as silently as she could towards the 
source. She rounded the corner of the middle column in the Temple – 
there was Link, the man she saw in her dream, wearing a set of boots 
which he struggled to walk in and brought crashing down with a <i>clang</i> 
with each step. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ruto relaxed her defenses and 
she approached Link from behind. Gently, she tapped him on the shoulder. 
Link jumped, appearing to go in different directions all at once. Ruto 
leaped back to give him space – his sword was unsheathed.  </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Oh, it’s only you!” 
Link sighed with relief when he turned to see his “assailant,” shouting 
to make his voice heard through the water. His ears were not well tuned 
to hear underwater. Ruto’s were and she cringed at the volume in his 
voice. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Only me?!” Ruto started 
at the insult. “How dare you? You keep me waiting for seven years 
and that’s all you can say?”</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Link grinned merrily at her. 
Indeed, he was as handsome in person as he was in her dream. His hair 
floated all around his face and the lights reflecting through the water 
shone in his eyes, making them appear to dance. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A few moments passed, along 
the two to catch up visually on the other after so many years of not 
seeing one another. Ruto spoke: “That young man, Sheik – he rescued 
me from the ice that covers Zora’s Domain and brought me here.” 
Ruto did not know if Link knew that Sheik was Zelda in disguise, but 
she did not feel it was her place to give that knowledge to Link if 
he didn’t already know. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“He’s been very helpful 
to me,” Link said, nodding agreeably. “I would not have gotten as 
far as I have without him.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“So you’ve proven to be 
a help to Sheik – can you help me?” Ruto asked. “I’m sure he’s 
told you about what needs to be done in here.” </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Link grinned. “He’s told 
me enough – let’s get started,” he said.</font></p>
