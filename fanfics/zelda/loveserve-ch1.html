<h1>Love and Servitude</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../zelda/index.html">Legend of Zelda</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shouchan.html">lilyfairy</a><br> </h2>
<pre>  The first day she saw her was exactly seven years ago... When Impa was 
taking Princess Zelda (currently 12 years old) to get horse-back riding 
lessons...
  &quot;You, farm-girl.&quot; Impa barked. a small, redhaired girl walked over 
from the stables. The second Zeld layed eyes on her, she felt strange... 
she had an odd, fluttery feeling in her stomach... she thought the girl 
was... beautiful... &#39;but, why&#39;, she wondered... &quot;Yes m&#39;lady.&quot; said the 
red-haired girl without looking up... &#39;look at me&#39;, Zelda thought... but 
she didn&#39;t know why...
  &quot;Fetch us a horse.&quot; ordered Impa.
  &quot;Yes m&#39;lady.&quot; said the girl, still not looking up. she runs off into 
the stable.
  &quot;Who was that?&quot; asked Zelda.
  &quot;A young farm-girl named Malon, daughter of Talon. Don&#39;t mind her 
though... she is very good with horses.&quot; replied Impa. &#39;Malon huh? 
Interesting name... though... still a beautiful one...&#39; Malon returned 
with a beautiful young red horse.
  &quot;Her name is Epona, she was a runt, and rejected by her mom, so I took 
care of her. She&#39;s real sweet...&quot; said Malon, stroaking the horse. 
&#39;Lucky horse... why&#39;d I think that?&#39;
  &quot;Thank you, Malon...&quot; Impa said &quot;Princess Zelda will be glad to learn 
to ride such a well brought up animal...&quot; Malon smiled, and she had a 
beautiful smile, it warmed Zelda up, inside... &#39;would Malon be teaching 
me?&#39; she wondered...
  &quot;Zelda, are you ready for your first lesson?&quot; asked Impa
  &quot;huh, oh, yeah, I guess...&quot; replied Zelda, in the midst of a daydream 
about... &#39;Her? Why her?&#39; Zelda wondered... &#39;well, she is nice, and ... 
pretty... and she has a great smile... why am i thinking this? it&#39;s 
almost as if... no, that can&#39;t be...&#39;
  &quot;Okay. Malon,&quot; Malon looked up, finally... she had deep, baby-blue 
eyes that Zelda got lost in.
  &quot;Yes, m&#39;lady?&quot;
  &quot;,would you like to teach the princess, you&#39;re way more experienced.&quot; 
offered Impa... &#39;say yes. say yes. say yes... say what?&#39; Zelda thought, 
so hard that she almost said it.
  &quot;I, uh--&quot;
  &quot;MALON&quot; called her father
  &quot;COMING... maybe next week...&quot; she replied, and Zelda deflated. &#39;cheer 
up, she thought, it&#39;s only a week... though, I&#39;m not sure I can wait 
that long...&#39;
  &quot;well... Zelda... do you want to start your lessons today, or next 
week?&quot; asked Impa.
  &quot;uh... I&#39;m tiered, so maybe next week...&quot; she replied. &quot;I&#39;m going to 
go look at the horses.&quot; which was, somewhat the truth, but soon 
wasn&#39;t... &#39;I have to see her&#39;... Zelda searched the whole farm and, 
after about 30 minutes of searching, found her. she was singing her 
signature song. (for those of you who&#39;ve never played Ocerina of Time, 
it&#39;s Epona&#39;s song) &#39;what a beautiful song... she&#39;s a very inbteresting 
girl... I&#39;ve only ever felt like this once... when he came... but, not 
to this magnitude... I think that I might be falling in love with her... 
but she&#39;s a girl, as am I... does that mean...&#39;
  &quot;am I a... lesbian... no, I cant be, I&#39;m a princess, I&#39;m supposed to 
marry a prince, and be a queen... and another girl can&#39;t be a prince... 
besides... she&#39;s a farm-girl and I&#39;m a princess...&quot;
  &quot;so?&quot; Zelda jumped back... Malon had somehow sneaked up behind 
Zelda... how much did she hear?
  &quot;so... who do you like?&quot; asked the farm-girl
  &quot;uh...&quot; Zelda began to blush... &quot;s-someone...&quot;
  &quot;well I know that but, who is it?&quot;
  &quot;uh... y-you p-probably don&#39;t know her-- I mean them...&quot;
  &quot;Try me... what do &#39;They&#39; look like?&quot;
  &quot;... well... they have red hair... and b-blue eyes... and...&quot; Malon 
leaned forward with a devious smile on her face
  &quot;And?&quot; now Zelda and Malon were only about an inch from each other&#39;s 
face.
  &quot;uh...&quot; Zelda was shaking now and blushing all over her face... we&#39;re 
so close... i could just reach out and... without thinking, Zelda leaned 
forward and kissed Malon... and Malon just kissed her back... &#39;whoa! 
w-we&#39;re kissing... but, what if Impa finds me... oh well, Impa won&#39;t 
care, she&#39;s this way too... I mean why else would Impa be hitting on 
those girls, and almost killing those gusrds when they hit on her... and 
there was also that night... a week ago...&#39;
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------flash 
back------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ~last week~
  It was about 7:00 pm, on Thursday. Impa was helping Zelda get ready 
for bed.
  &quot;Impa...&quot;
  &quot;yes, m&#39;lady?&quot;
  &quot;What were you doing the other night?&quot;
  &quot;What do you mean?&quot;
  &quot;well, you are normaly in the room next to mine, but last night, you 
weren&#39;t... where were you&quot;
  &quot;er... at a... friends...&quot;
  &quot;Impa... I can tell when you&#39;re lying... tell me the truth.&quot;
  &quot;I... oh, fine... I can&#39;t tell you withouth showing you though&quot; a 
devilish smile slowly spread across Impa&#39;s face.
  &quot;W-what do you mean&quot; stammered Zelda.
  &quot;I mean, you&#39;ll have to play along. and I know you&#39;ll like it.&quot; Impa 
commented, a smile, not only on her face, but in her voice as well.
  &quot;O-okay, Impa... I trust you... I&#39;ll play along.&quot;
  &quot;Good,&quot; Impa half-purred, &quot;then, first, you need to lay down on your 
bed.&quot;
  &quot;O... kay...&quot; Zelda said, comfusedly, as she obeyed her mentor.
  &quot;Now... this may make you uncomfertable at first, but trust me...&quot; 
Impa sat down next to Zelda... And, much to the princess&#39; surprise, bent 
forward and kissed her on the forehead. &quot;Such a beauty for someone so 
young... I want you to know that this will be one of your most 
wonderfull experiences, I&#39;ll make sure of that, but if you get too 
uncomfertable, tell me.&quot; said the elite royal guardian as she began to 
trail kisses all the way down to Zelda&#39;s lips.
  &quot;Impa... what are you--&quot; the princess&#39; question was cut off by Impa&#39;s 
lips, as she gave Zelda a passionate kiss... &#39;wow... but Impa&#39;s a 
girl... why is she doing this... but... I do kind of like it... and to 
think my first kiss would be from a girl... oh well... but if Mother or 
one of the Guards see us...&#39; &quot;Impa, stop.&quot; said Zelda, breaking the 
kiss.
  &quot;What is it my princess? Am I making you uncomfortable?&quot; inquired 
Impa.
  &quot;No, I&#39;m just worried we&#39;ll get caught. Mother would be most 
displeased if she found us kissing...&quot; replied the peach-haired 
princess.
  &quot;Oh... well then, follow me.&quot; said Impa, standing up, &quot;we can do this 
in my quarters then... I&#39;ll leave a note telling anyone who comes in 
here that I&#39;m giving you riding lessons.&quot;
  &quot;Okay... why are you doing this? Not that I don&#39;t like it, but we&#39;re 
both girls, and you&#39;re like 13 years older than me...&quot;
  &quot;My dear princes,&quot; chucled the silver-haired guard, &quot;love knows no age 
nor gender... and you wanted to know what I did last night, right?&quot;
  &quot;I suppose I did... and did you say &#39;love&#39;?&quot; asked the now blushing 
princess.
  &quot;I did. Why? And you&#39;re blushing.&quot; replied Impa, with a slight laugh.
  &quot;Well I just... Um... Nevermind. Shall we head to your quarters now?&quot; 
&#39;why am I enjoying this?&#39;
  &quot;We shall.&quot; said Impa, scooping up her beloved Queen-to-be.
  &quot;Impa... I feel the same...&quot; said the young girl, kissing her guardian 
on the chin.
  &quot;I&#39;m glad, my lovely princess.&quot; Impa replied, kissing Zelda&#39;s 
froehead, again.
  &quot;... Are we going to stand here all night, not that I wouldn&#39;t mind 
being like this for eternity, but I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll get tired...&quot;
  &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re concerned for me, but I will be fine, and I have no 
intention to stand here any longer&quot; stated Impa, starting out of Zelda&#39;s 
room.
  &quot;Oh, Impa... I never felt so complete... I must truely love you... but 
when did I become a lesbian... oh well, I&#39;m with you, and that&#39;s all 
that matters.&quot; whispered Zelda, as she nuzzled further against her 
guardian.
  &quot;I&#39;ll help you feel more complete, just you wait.&quot; replied Impa, 
looking at her princess with a loving expression.
  &quot;I don&#39;t want to have to, my new love.&quot; stated Zelda.
  &quot;You can&#39;t imagine what this will be like, but you&#39;ll love it, I&#39;ll 
make sure.&quot; purred Impa, lovingly.
  &quot;okay, I trust you...&quot; said Zelda, as she began stroking Impa&#39;s hair 
that hung down behind her. Soon they arrived at the door to Impa&#39;s 
quarters.
  &quot;Here we are, why don&#39;t you lay down and I&#39;ll be back soon.&quot; said 
Impa, setting Zeld grabbing a night outfit, a quill, an inkwell, and 
some parchment.
  &quot;Okay, be quick though, or I may fall asleep...&quot; said Zelda, yawning.
  &quot;I will, just make yourself comfortable... my lovely princess...&quot; said 
Impa as she left the room. &#39;what is wrong with me, she&#39;s alot older than 
me, and she&#39;s a girl... but she&#39;s so beautiful, and lovely... who cares 
how old she is, or what her gender is... I love her...&#39; thought Zelda as 
she plopped down on Impa&#39;s round, queen-sized bed... then the door 
opened and Impa entered in a short night gown.
  &quot;So, my lovely princess, are you ready for what I wanted to show you?&quot;
  &quot;Never readier, my beautiful guardian. So, shall we start again?&quot;
  &quot;Yes... we will&quot; said the platinum-headed Guard Of The Throne, sitting 
down by her young lover, as before, and trailed kisses from the girl&#39;s 
forehead to her lips, then began a passionate kiss again. the, she 
slowely reached down and pulled Zelda&#39;s hand to her breast.
  &quot;This is where you start feeling me, and I begin to undress you, 
understand?&quot; said Impa, breafly breaking the kiss.
  &quot;I believe so... like this?&quot; replied the younger lady, taking control 
of her hand back from Impa.
  &quot;Oh, yes. You learn fast. Now...&quot; Impa recommenced the kiss and 
slowely unzipped, and removed Zelda&#39;s one-piece night outfit, revealing 
her young breasts and underwear.
  &quot;Now, you start undressing me, as I finish undressing you.&quot; instructed 
Impa, guiding the younger girls hand to the bottom of her night dress.
  &quot;Okay... and you were right, I do like this.&quot; said Zelda as she slid 
Impa&#39;s dress up to her shoulders, revealing her well-rounded breasts and 
uncovered vulva.
  &quot;I thought so. Now, I start &#39;pleasuring&#39; you and you just let me do my 
thing.&quot; said Impa, as she took off Zelda&#39;s lace underpants and lowered 
herself down to Zelda&#39;s young, and unspoiled, pleasure zone. First she 
massaged the outer folds, while licking Zelda&#39;s cliturous. She was soon 
rewarded by a pleasureful and loving moan from her younger lover. Then 
she moved up to Zelda&#39;s almost prepeubessant breasts, taking the right 
nipple into her mouth and playing with the other one with her free hand, 
and was answered by lusting gasps and moans from her playmate. 
Eventually, Zelda started to moisten between her leggs, and that cued 
Impa to insert her middle fonger into Zelda&#39;s sex, causing the girl to 
twitch and writh under her, gasping, and almost squealling out in 
pleasure. then Impa released Zelda&#39;s now hardened nipple from her mouth 
and commenced to kiss Zelda deeply. Zelda moaned into Impa&#39;s mouth, as 
Impa started moving her finger in and out of the younge lady&#39;s slit.
  The princess answered this action further by moving her hips back and 
forth, increasing the force at which Impa&#39;s finger entered her. Zelda 
started tensing up and writhing further, and then she came in her first, 
pleasent orgasm. Impa stopped pumping her finger and kissing Zelda to 
star licking Zelda&#39;s juices off her finger.
  &quot;Mmmm... You taste so good. So, what did you think for you first time&quot; 
asked Impa, still licking her finger.
  &quot;It was amazing,&quot; panted Zelda, &quot;Thank you Impa... You are the best... 
do you want me to take care of you now?&quot;
  &quot;No, I can do that myself, you just rest right there and look 
beautiful, while I go take care of something.&quot; cooed Impa as she walked 
into her bathroom. &#39;wow, that felt amazing... I don&#39;t think I can 
move... I&#39;m so... tired...&#39; Zelda slowely dozed off.

behind, &quot;I see you two are getting along.&quot;
