******************************

I watched listlessly as tiny fireflies danced through the leaves, 
mixing and mingling with the fairies and other mysterious creatures of 
my realm. Someone not born or raised in these woods would not even be 
able to distinguish the many different species. For them, they would 
just be spook spheres of light. There was nothing spooky about them 
though. Actually, right now, I envied them. They all knew their place, 
knew their task in the cycle of life. A simplistic life that knew only 
that which was important for themselves.
	No cross-race interaction, no greater fate that took you away 
from home, set you apart from those you called kin.
	I sighed softly, closing my eyes, listening to the sounds around 
me, feeling the atmosphere of the place I had called home for several 
long and innocent years. Yes, back then it had been innocent. Without 
care for the future, for what awaited us, we had no idea. Sure, I 
always had had a special connection to the Lost Woods, the spirits 
within, however, I would not have imagined the source turning out to 
lead to such a... sad fate.
	This was no good. Usually I could go anywhere in the Lost Woods 
and get my mind off my problems, to wash away the melancholy that at 
times settled into my soul. Today though, today nothing had the 
ability to lift my mood. He wasn&#39;t here anymore and he might as well 
never come back now. Why should he? He led a different life now, had 
for some time already, and while I shared the same destiny with him, 
we still lived in two different worlds. Before today, I had always 
managed to lure myself into the false belief that maybe, just maybe 
there might still be some hope, that nothing had changed, that we 
could stay the way we were in younger years forever. He had been my 
last anchor, my last &quot;link&quot; to my childhood days. And he was gone now, 
beyond my reach. These days were over and would never return.
	I blinked my eyes open, noticing a ripple in the clear surface 
of the small pond. I had settled down here, feet dangling in the 
water, since the meadow was invoking even more memories right now. 
Startled I scooted backwards a little as something emerged from the 
water, sending a spray of the cool liquid sprinkling over my body. For 
a moment I stared transfixed at the graceful form of the other. The 
water was glistering on her bluish skin, giving it a kind of sparkling 
effect, enhancing the exotic beauty of its owner. She had matured into 
a prime specimen of her kin, that was something I could freely admit. 
Having dealt with different species and their physiologies over years, 
that had been one of the easiest things to adjust to after becoming a 
Sage. Those different races outside, Hylians, Gorons, Zoras, 
Gerudos... They were all unique but all of them were also living 
beings that should be respected for what they were instead of 
measuring with one&#39;s own common standards.
	&quot;There you are,&quot; Princess Ruto, Sage of Water, stated 
matter-of-factly, placing her hands on her hips. &quot;I figured you&#39;d be 
here pitying yourself.&quot;
	A groan rose to my lips, averting my gaze quickly, not quite 
sure what had made me stare in the first place. &quot;Leave me alone. I&#39;m 
not in the mood,&quot; I grumbled, albeit knowing it was foolish. It had 
been an odd... friendship... that had formed between us. Yes, I 
suppose you could call it friendship, or maybe a kinship. Most of the 
time I was actually glad for the company of the slightly bossy and 
haughty Zora Princess. She wasn&#39;t really a bad person, once you got to 
know her. Most of her attitude came from a great deal of spoiling in 
her youth, or that is what I suspected, and often her open and direct 
expression of feeling was a refreshing counter for my bouts of 
depression. That didn&#39;t stop it from being annoying most of the 
time...
	Ruto looked crossly at me for a moment. &quot;Right, that&#39;s what I 
figured.&quot; I expected some kind of lecture to come and inwardly 
prepared myself but what really came I was unprepared to hear from the 
young Zora. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you drop that disguise by now?&quot;
	For the second time since her arrival I found myself staring at 
Ruto, this time with disbelief. &quot;How did you...?&quot;
	She gave me a hurt look. &quot;Everyone, even &#39;She&#39;,&quot; the pronoun was 
used with a distinctive disdain, &quot;I think, does. He would see through 
it to if he wasn&#39;t so blinded by appearance and memories.&quot;
	I sighed audibly, acknowledging defeat. Deep down I had known 
that the only ones important to me that I was probably able to fool 
were the other Kokiri. Of course the Sages would see through it. &quot;That 
is why it would have never made a difference,&quot; I replied sadly, at the 
same time letting the magic of the illusion spell around me dispel, my 
body seemingly growing mysteriously to that of a young teenager, woman 
nearly. My green hair fell long over my back, past my shoulders and 
nearly reaching my waist.
	The admiring stare from Ruto was a little disconcerting.

******************************

	By Nayru! I was by far not an expert for Hylian or other 
human-like species&#39; beauty attributes but... When the Hylian&#39;s admired 
Zelda for her beauty, they&#39;d probably go crazy seeing Saria now. Oh, 
there wasn&#39;t that much of a superficial difference, concerning 
features and whatnot. However, what had before been cute child that 
even I had found somewhat adoring on first glance, had now transformed 
into a woman whose body was well-developed to a degree that could easy 
rival the stereotype beauty of Hyrule&#39;s beauty or the dominating, kind 
of exotic appearance of Nabooru. Of course, I was still prettier 
but... she was really coming close.
	While I had been able to tell that she had woven a spell around 
herself to maintain her appearance of a young child, I had not been 
able to really look through it. I suspected that was because it wasn&#39;t 
really an illusion. Maybe more like an ability, switching as she 
pleased. I would sometimes give a lot for that. Would be a need way to 
escape the numerous royal duties or father&#39;s pressure on me to find a 
suitable mate.
	Now, with today, my last excuse had been taken away with the 
wedding that just a few minutes ago had drawn to a close. I had 
actually expected Saria to slip away early. I had barely been able to 
endure the entire thing smiling with the forced dignity of royalty. 
Let the public say what they want about the &quot;perfect match&quot;, about the 
&quot;best royal couple ever&quot;, the &quot;fairytale wedding&quot;. To me it was a 
farce, it was a mistake. I could not understand why it wasn&#39;t 
prevented, why especially Rauru hadn&#39;t said a word. I had read about 
this long ago. The lines of hero and princess should never be 
united... And yet the wedding had taken place, leaving behind the two 
remaining other suitors with empty hands and broken hearts.
	It hurt, to see them so happy, knowing that the possibility was 
far beyond my grasp, had always been. It had been a child&#39;s fantasy, 
innocent and ultimately meaningless. I had acknowledged that to myself 
already, yet the little glimmer of a last feeble hope was there. 
Unfounded surely, but one could dream, right?
	Her, though... She had every right to be depressed and it pained 
me to see it. All that had stood between them was the age problem, the 
racial difference, or so I had thought. Now though, Saria&#39;s comment 
made me rethink that theory. If this really had been all, she would 
have had no reason to hide this from him. &quot;Are you so sure about 
that?&quot; I asked with a little doubt but also curious.
	Saria shifted uncomfortably, making me aware that I was still 
staring at her, no more like... evaluating. Shifting my gaze away 
slightly, I chastened myself mentally for that unconscious reaction. 
This wasn&#39;t helping her to relax at all.
	&quot;I will always be the little girl, the best friend. This,&quot; Saria 
gestured at her grown form, &quot;is just physical. It doesn&#39;t change what 
is in the heart.&quot;
	&#39;And if he had decided for her just because of the physical 
aspect it wouldn&#39;t have been love,&#39; I finished the unspoken in my 
mind, sympathizing with the logic but at the same time seeing it as a 
great shame to not at least try. She was just too kind, too 
good-natured for that, probably had told herself that someone of his 
own kin was better for him to begin with, that their relationship was 
doomed.
	If you asked me that was nonsense. Seven years ago, when all 
this started, I probably would have been frightened by myself for 
admitting that but... If anyone deserved Link it was Saria. She was 
the only one who I would have readily been happy for. Not that 
mismatch, that illusion he and Zelda were celebrating today. They had 
no idea what they were doing to that innocent child who had her whole 
existence turned upside down by the events, by her awakening as a 
Sage. At least most of us could still live pretty much normally. 
Saria, however, had lost so much, the bonds to her own realm, to the 
childhood she had grown up in had been severely strained. To a degree 
I could understand that or at least I tried to.
	Well, I wasn&#39;t here just to contemplate all that. I never was 
good at that kind of stuff; thinking I mean. Saria was my friend, as 
odd as the association had started off and been until now. If anyone 
should be qualified to understand and share her pain, it should be me. 
And as that, it should be me who helped her to get over it. 
Fortunately I had a sure and fail proof method to do so.

******************************

	The devilish grin appearing on the Zora&#39;s face was the only 
warning I got. I barely managed to shield myself from the sudden spray 
of water and the next moment I was already drenched, feeling the cool 
liquid on my bare skin...
	Wait a second!
	I glanced down at myself mortified, just standing there for 
several long seconds before my brain even managed to process the 
visual information properly. I was sitting there in the grass of the 
pond area butt-naked!
	In a flash I was on my feet, leveling a death glare at the 
apparent - and only available - evildoer. My jaw dropped slightly as I 
saw the Zora Princess waving a bundle of clothes in one hand, looking 
quite pleased with herself. My clothes!
	&quot;Hmm, didn&#39;t think it would work that well,&quot; Ruto contemplated 
thoughtfully, then, as if just noticing my agitation, shifted her 
gaze. &quot;Oh? You lost something?&quot; And before I could react a sprout of 
water catapulted her into the air and over my own form. I whirled 
around but she was already moving again. &quot;Come on! Catch me, if you 
want them back!&quot;
	Damn, how could she run that fast? On land? I had moved before 
the command had really formed as a conscious thought. &quot;Come back here! 
I know what you are trying to do!&quot; Oh yes, I did. That was just the 
sort of thing I expected, feared and maybe, maybe hoped for just a 
little bit. Not in such an extreme form though!
	Ruto giggled and accelerated a bit more. &quot;Really? Why are you 
going along with it then?&quot; Right now I was really angry with myself 
not to get used to this body. I was accustomed to the pace of a small 
child, not this adult form. &quot;After all I thought you Kokiri were too 
innocent to have qualms about running around nude once in awhile.&quot; She 
was actually right about that but I would surely not admit that, 
besides contact with the outside had influenced my ethics just a 
little bit.
	The Zora Princess was weaving a path through the forest maze now 
but somehow managing not to get lost even once. It shouldn&#39;t really 
surprise me. Anyone sensitive enough should be able to follow the 
hidden path. I skidded to a halt in one of the clearings, not sure 
which way my quarry had taken. Something caught my attention but when 
I had turned Ruto was already off again, abandoning her hiding place 
behind one of the boulders.
	&quot;Stop that!&quot; I shouted in vain protest, knowing it was futile. 
&quot;What if someone sees us?&quot; Many had seen us already. The fairies and 
other creatures inhabiting the woods. They didn&#39;t care all that much 
though and I think the other Sage knew that all too well.
	&quot;Lighten up, already!&quot; Ruto shouted back and continued to run. 
She was making her way back to the pond I noticed.
	Adrenaline was pumping through my veins and I felt the knot of 
depression unwind, the bubble of sadness ready to burst any moment. 
She was doing it again and while I did not - and usually never did at 
first - agree with her method, I felt genuine gratitude. I could see 
over the short distance that Ruto was enjoying herself just as much as 
she was trying to bring me to enjoy myself. There was that teasing 
gleam in her eyes, slowly mingling with a sense of victory as she must 
have noticed my resolve faltering.
	&quot;Give...&quot; A giggle. &quot;... them back...&quot; Light, tickling laughter, 
brewing just underneath the surface to erupt any moment. &quot;... 
already!&quot; I couldn&#39;t help myself. Laughter spilled from my lips as I 
continued to chase the elusive Zora through the Lost Woods. It was 
refreshing. Free and genuine, just like back then with Link, before 
all this had started and afterwards when she had come to cheer me up 
this way.
	Somehow Ruto had always managed to draw it out with her 
playfulness. I envied her for that, that despite growing up, 
shouldering all those royal duties, she still managed to maintain some 
of this childlike innocence, that playfulness. Others might find it 
foolish, unsuited for someone of her standing. I found it simply 
refreshing.
	We had reached the pond again and while I was bathing in the joy 
of the moment, the unrestricted freedom, the harmony between two souls 
estranged from their own kin through circumstances beyond their 
control, I was still aware enough to identify the attempt for what it 
was. Not stopping to concentrate I muttered a few words just as Ruto 
dived down into the water, heading for the warp portal, connecting 
mine and her realm. Without hesitation I jumped after her, not even 
taking notice of the actual target lying on the ground next to the 
pond...

******************************

	Just as I expected. She was following. It seemed the usual 
routine was working again, thankfully. I had half-expected her to get 
really angry, as uncharacteristically as that might be. The ceremony 
must have provoked a deeper pain when she was showing. Saria was the 
kind of person who rather kept her personal problems to herself, in 
favor of not wishing to worry those around her. As much as that might 
be admirable at times, it was also self-destructive. And I could not 
just stand by and watch.
	Glancing behind me I saw her breaking the surface and moving 
with a surprising agility. Another thing that had come as a pleasant 
surprise. Unlike Link who never was that good a swimmer without Zora 
items to assist him, the Forest Sage was much more talented. And 
faster. &#39;Not that she can catch me if I don&#39;t want her to,&#39; I thought 
smugly, speeding up a little, only to almost smash into the force 
field emitting a faint, nearly transparent glimmer.
	&quot;Clever,&quot; I admired and waited just a little longer for Saria to 
catch up before I twisted my body into a sharp turn maneuver, slipping 
past underneath her. For a brief second our gazes locked and I could 
see the happy, carefree sparkle in blue eyes. That alone was worth it. 
A smile was briefly formed and answered, before I shot past her, back 
to the surface and dry land.
	My eyes widened in amazement when the other girl managed to 
nearly copy the maneuver perfectly, keeping close on my tail. For 
someone not natural and equipped to the element this was quite 
impressive. Realizing that there was little point in trying further 
and seeing that I had reached my goal already, I decided to let Saria 
catch up the rest of the way, just as we broke the surface again. The 
pond was too small to give me any greater advantage and with the warp 
portal blocked there was no other option. Oh, I could have warped by 
myself but that was cheating and where was the fun in that?
	Giggles burst forth from both us, chasing away the melancholy 
and depression that had claimed us since the ceremony earlier on. I 
might have not shown it as much as she had but seeing them getting 
married had been just as painful for me, and thus this moment of 
untainted joy was just as refreshing for me as it was for her. Saria 
had tackled me from behind and now had her arms tightly around my 
slippery body. I guess I probably could have slipped away but I didn&#39;t 
want to. A tingle ran up and down my entire form and I was all too 
aware of it. This felt good. Not the liberating laughter. That too, 
but also the closeness, the kinship... maybe more.
	&quot;Now that is better,&quot; I said seriously, grinning like the winner 
I felt being. And even though Saria might have caught me, that had 
never been the true goal of the chase. The true goal I had already 
achieved. I doubt the wedding or Link even crossed the other&#39;s mind 
right now.
	&quot;You are incorrigible,&quot; Saria giggled, trying to tickle me 
without much success. Zora-skin wasn&#39;t all that sensitive to the 
beloved human friendly torture method. Not that either of us cared 
very much.
	I wasn&#39;t quite sure what made me say it this way. Okay, maybe in 
the back of my mind where had been a plan, an option pursued and 
analyzed, yet the words slipped out without much conscious thought. 
&quot;You are much more beautiful when you are happy.&quot; And Link was an 
idiot for spoiling that so badly.
	Saria blushed, obviously becoming quite aware how close we were 
with her being naked - a concept that never held much worth for us 
Zoras. She averted her gaze slightly, simultaneously trying to pull 
away but I was quick to turn around and entangle her legs with my own. 
&quot;Why are you always trying so hard with me? After all we are supposed 
to be rivals,&quot; the Forest Sage asked quietly.
	&quot;Were,&quot; I pointed out. &quot;Besides, that never was the point 
anyway.&quot; I favored her with an affectionate smile and in that moment a 
decision was made. There was something between us that I couldn&#39;t 
ignore anymore and if I was honest with myself, I didn&#39;t even want to. 
Reaching out I cupped the other girl&#39;s chin with one hand, forcing her 
to look at me as I leaned forward. &quot;Maybe I simply like you.&quot;
	Not hesitating a second I crossed the last bit of distance, lips 
meeting in a soft, promising contact. Pleasantly surprised I noticed 
not the tiniest bit of hesitation on Saria&#39;s part. She melted into the 
kiss just like that, falling against me as my arms came around her 
form, pulling her close. This wasn&#39;t really passionate, it wasn&#39;t 
exactly long either but... it was a promise. A promise for something 
more, something better to come. Solace, salvation, maybe it wasn&#39;t 
much more right now but it could become more.
	&quot;Maybe I just like you,&quot; I repeated when we parted, our faces 
just inches apart, &quot;A lot.&quot;

******************************
	Lemon
******************************

	This was quite surreal. By all means I should be freaked, 
freaked at the absurd calmness I suddenly felt. That calmness in our 
closeness, the contact of naked skin and the kiss, too. I didn&#39;t 
though and that was what... confused me, on a superficial level at 
least. Maybe it was the unexpected action... Or was it really 
unexpected? Something had begun to... stir when we had begun to spend 
more time together. This feeling was different from what I felt for 
Link. New, somewhat confusing, intriguing... and refreshing. After all 
these years of holding onto a hopeless concept, this new feeling was 
like a tiny but continuously growing ray of hope.
	And now it wasn&#39;t hidden anymore, it was an almost blinding 
bright light that couldn&#39;t be ignored any longer. What was I supposed 
to do? How was I supposed to react. Ruto was always so... open, so 
direct. I wasn&#39;t like that, I knew that. And maybe, maybe she was 
right that this latest character trait - because I hadn&#39;t been at all 
like this when I was younger - might have cost me any possible chance 
with Link. I still believed I did the right thing but then again, she 
did have a good point, too.
	As I said, this new feeling was refreshing, in many ways. Ruto 
managed to bring forth traits from me I had thought long discarded or 
at least carefully hidden away. And she especially managed to break 
through the shields and barriers that I had built up since coming into 
my role as the Forest Sage.
	Which made my reaction so ridiculously easy to decide - which it 
hadn&#39;t just a few minutes ago - because I felt a lot more open than I 
had in a long time. More free and... younger. Unbound by rules, both 
self-imposed and others.
	I think the Zora princess was a little startled when I pulled 
her into another kiss but the surprised look quickly changed into one 
of excitement as she returned the action in equal fervor. &#39;This is 
mad,&#39; I thought to myself with a mental giggle as I caught the Water 
Sage&#39;s tongue with my own, noting the exotic taste and smell, &#39;but I 
don&#39;t care right now.&#39;
	My hands trailed down the Zora&#39;s sides, mesmerizing, testing the 
various reactions. Contrary to believe we Kokiri were not... oblivious 
to the meaning, nature or mechanisms of sex. To explain further would 
go too far here but let us just say, innocence was not something that 
could be explained with just a label for the physical aspect. However, 
Ruto was a whole different species after all. Kokiri and Hylians were 
more or less similar in the physical sense, yet while the Zora&#39;s were 
also humanoid there were some clear differences, like other erogenous 
zones.
	For example, the fins as I noted quickly at the sparkle of bliss 
appearing on the Zora&#39;s face as I brushed over them. The reaction was 
almost immediate as she separated from the kiss and began to trail a 
path down to my neck, gentle but insistent. Her hands became bolder, 
finding my breasts, the slippery digits moving over them in teasing 
circles that made me groan in frustration.
	&quot;Ruto,&quot; I pleaded but gasped again when the princess sucked 
lightly on my throat and tweaked one of my nipples sharply. Violet 
eyes peered up through a hooded gaze that made me shudder in 
anticipation and the next moment her mouth was on my chest, licking, 
sucking and downright devouring. While I might have initiated this 
stage, I realized that Ruto had managed to reduce me to nothing more 
than a passive receiver. And she was taking great delight in it!
	As much as that galled me, all I could do was rest against the 
shore of the pond and endure while the young Zora paid rapt attention 
to her work. My hands tangled in her &#39;hair&#39; - or whatever you could 
call it -, finding no real grasp in order to anchor myself against the 
strong sensations.
	Lost in the intensity of Ruto&#39;s ministrations, I almost missed 
the sudden splash if not for the fact that Ruto in the process of 
diving underwater had pretty much let up on what she was doing. I 
looked down in momentary confusion before jumping slightly when I felt 
the Zora&#39;s hand gently parting my legs. Before I could as much as 
react, only able to stare down into the clear water and watch in rapt 
fascination, a sudden jolt made me squeal in delight which quickly 
turned into a languished moan.
	Grasping onto the solid surface behind me, I tried to hold on as 
a good as possible as unbelievable pleasure shot through my body in 
shorter and shorter waves as Ruto&#39;s tongue literally danced between my 
legs. I clenched my eyes shut, yielding to the incredible bliss and 
just waited for the explosion I could feel just a breath away...

******************************
	If I were to point out one thing about myself that I believed to 
be a positive character trait, it was being persistent. True, that had 
also brought me into some uncomfortable situations and I was well 
aware of the reputation I had earned of being... bossy. But I never 
was one for longwinded discussions and carefully weighing pro and 
contra. Something that always brought my father close to a mental 
breakdown. I wasn&#39;t haughty. That I would always decline with 
vehemence. I was used to royal etiquette and usually getting what I 
wanted, yet if that should be all the criteria to label one as haughty 
I found that rather pitiful.
	But persistent, yes, I would readily sign that. So, while 
Saria&#39;s initial move had clearly surprised me, not having expected 
such a strong and immediate reaction - yet being thoroughly delighted 
about the openness - I was quick to respond on my own and take charge 
of the situation. Because that was what I was best at, thus I might 
even agree with bossy even though it was too negative for my taste.
	Doing this with a human - well, Kokiri, but the physical 
differences were hardly noticeable - was different from what I had 
experience with before. Oh yes, I did have experience with other 
Zoras, that was part of my training, bridal training to be exact. With 
some of them I had made good friends and it had been a lot of fun - as 
it should be, I never understood these petty inhibition concept of the 
land tribes - but that had been it, no further personal attachment.
	This was more though, and that was why I gave the young Forest 
Sage my full attention, she deserved no less anyway after the rough 
time she had had lately, and especially today. Since she was obviously 
ready to advance this new twist to our relationship faster than I had 
anticipated, I would make sure that she was neither going to regret 
nor forget her first time soon.
	She was close now, very close. I had read a bit about human 
anatomy, mostly because of Link and thus respectively about Hylian 
males but I had also took the one or other curious glance at the other 
gender. Time to put that knowledge and the newfound trust and openness 
of the other girl to a test. I was really curious about how far Saria 
was willing to go.
	I retreated my tongue much to the displeasure of the Kokiri girl 
as I noted when I reemerged from the water in a spray of liquid but 
that was quickly remedied when I slipped two fingers between her 
folds. Saria bucked hard and I moaned in delight when her hands 
suddenly grabbed onto my tender butt cheeks. Using my free hand to 
grasp onto green hair I pushed Saria into a hungry kiss, adding a 
third finger into her tight but by now well-lubricated passage until 
all of them rested just against the final barrier of her physical 
innocence - something we Zora did not possess. I understood this was a 
delicate matter for any human or human-like girl and so I stilled my 
movements, locking my eyes on her blue ones, silently asking.
	There was the briefest flicker of doubt, of hesitation, and then 
a firm resolve, a deep, calm trust that was overwhelming and 
heartwarming. Before I could act on the silent compliance, Saria 
actually grinded down onto my fingers which tore away at the 
obtrusion, now fully connecting me to my friend, fellow sage and now 
also - finally, a small, long silent part of myself admitted - lover.

THE END (for now)

Author&#39;s Notes

To be honest, I started this last year at some point (can&#39;t really 
remember) and then kind of left it almost finished. Actually all I did 
was just do superficial corrections and add the lemon bit. I think it 
started on another strange notion of my totally weird (and that is 
putting it mildly) muse. I am actually a strong Link/Saria supporter 
and so this was rather new for me. And should I ever get to expand 
this little continuity...
But no, I shouldn&#39;t tell. First because I would create false hopes and 
second because it would spoil the fun.
There is a sister piece to this fic, basically in the same continuum 
but you can read it separately or you don&#39;t have to at all (unless I 
decided on connecting them later through another story). It&#39;s called 
Spiritual Attraction and is of another strange pairing. You&#39;ll have to 
go and see for yourself. ^_^

Hope you liked this new, odd piece of mine. I had fun writing this and 
the other one, so let me know what you thought. All kind of feedback 
is welcomed and desired.

Ja ne, yours

Matthias
