 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It has been said for centuries 
that as twilight falls we feel an odd assortment of sorrows and regrets. 
These emotions are channeled into the evening sky from those banished 
from the World of Light into that of the Twilight. </font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">For years as I grew up, I didn’t 
think twice about this ancient telling. It a myth to any Hylian citizen. 
When I was a little girl, not more than five springs, my father and 
I often sat on the balcony facing the western horizon. My beloved sire 
pulled me into his lap and hugged me close, and then told me to not 
look too long into our setting sun. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“The Twili, the people who 
live in the Twilight, will come and get you and eat you for breakfast!” 
I continued to watch the sun for a few moments, wide-eyed, then his 
comment registered and I looked at his face with a combination of disbelief 
and consternation.</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">He laughed a deep belly laugh 
and I started jumping up and down in his lap. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“What else eats me for breakfast, 
Daddy?!” I shrieked.</font></p>
 <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Why are you so anxious to 
find out?” He said, laughing the whole time. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I – have – to – know!” 
I would shout, leaping about on the balcony. Father drew me close. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Why, I don’t know little 
one! You are so tiny that anyone could eat you in one mouthful! And 
I do believe your hair would get caught in their teeth,” he would 
whisper conspiratorially in my ear and laugh again. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My hair has always been a source 
of pride and joy for me – vain to some, but any woman will tell you 
that her hair is a crown, regardless of her social status. As a woman, 
I have dark, strawberry-blonde hair, but as a child, my hair was a sight 
of messy, curly, white-blonde tresses. My father stroked and twisted 
it thoughtfully in his fingers whenever I sat in his lap. It was not 
a rare occasion in which he bragged to all his knights and courtiers 
in our throne room that I was the very image of my mother. I grinned 
from ear to ear and made sure everyone saw my mannerly behavior and 
how I was fit to be a princess. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Indeed, I was a princess by 
blood. My father was Guardian of Hyrule, and I was his only child, Crown 
Princess Zelda. My mother had been a powerful leader alongside my father, 
and while she lived, the kingdom never felt concern about peace and 
safety. My mama never failed to fulfill her role as Queen Protector 
of Hyrule. </font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Raised a warrior, she was born 
and bred to viciously fight to the death. The country she had been born 
into – San-kirla – did not discriminate between male and female 
warriors or rich and poor fighters. Valor belonged to any who defended 
their country at great personal sacrifice. Both genders and all people 
of all social statuses were required to fight in the wars their country 
waged. San-kirla was a tiny country but had ideal and diverse lands 
– warm and humid weather in the northeast, hot and dry deserts in 
the west, fertile farmlands in the southwest and piney woods and cool 
beaches in the southeast. Not even my beloved Hyrule can compare to 
the geographically varied country that is San-kirla. As Queen Mother 
Protector myself, I continue to carefully tend the alliance between 
Hyrule and San-kirla – their soldiers are the best, bar none. They 
would answer my country’s call for help in less time than it takes 
to saddle a horse, I’m confident; my Hyrule is more than ready to 
respond to their cry for aid, as well. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But not even the most fantastical 
warrior is invincible. “Mankind is mortal,” my tutors all repeated 
countless times, and the lesson was especially painful at my mother’s 
death. She didn’t die in childbirth like many women do in this age; 
she died in battle with an arrow to the heart. My father stood beside 
her when she fell and did everything he knew to do, but it was too late 
to save her. I was four springs when my mother died – my father aged 
a hundred years after her death. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When I am asked what I remember 
of her death and its’ aftermath, I hesitate, clear my throat and beg 
pardon. “It is a very old memory – you must forgive me,” I say. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I remember being in a bedroom, 
about to take my afternoon nap. My father assigned me to a room that 
could keep me safe if the invading Gerudo had taken it into their head 
to come and find me. My nurse was sitting close to my bed, knitting. 
Her needles made an incessant clacking noise that often irritated me, 
but that day, their regular prattling emitted a soothing rhythm. </font></p>
 <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Soon after I lay back on the 
mattress and stared up at the stone ceiling, I faintly heard the city 
gates being opened. At that moment, I thought nothing of it, but the 
distinct, restrained sound of wailing became evident in my ears. I turned 
my head to the window and only saw the sky and the pinnacles of tall 
buildings. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A deep, unsettling disturbance 
in my mind awoke and I became suspicious. The disturbance in my mind 
increased when the steel gates leading to my home opened and the wailing 
continued, becoming loud. The ululating, piercing noise made me quiver 
and I looked over at my nurse to see when she would notice that something 
was wrong. Just when I thought I couldn’t bear it anymore, my nurse 
finally heard the mournful cacophony and ran out of the room, wanting 
to see what was happening. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I was left in that room alone. 
The fear slipped down from my mind into my young heart. What felt like 
hours later, I heard a gentle knock on my door. I tried to say, “Come 
in,” but it came out as a tremulous squeak. A senior guard in my father’s 
personal army came in through the door: “Lady Zelda, your mother has 
died valiantly in battle.”</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I don’t remember anything 
much after that. I don’t remember how I spent the rest of the day, 
I don’t remember the funeral, and I don’t remember seeing my father 
in the week following my mother’s burial, although I can imagine his 
demand that I be kept in his sight at all times, a manifestation of 
his grief. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I was often told that I looked 
like my mother when she was a child. When her family from San-kirla 
and close friends came to visit, they would hold me tightly and sometimes 
cry when they looked at me. “Just like her <i>mamelah</i>,” they 
would whisper. </font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But my father did not shun 
me as many fathers do after their precious wives’ death. It is not 
common for the reflection of their wife in the children to force fathers 
to shut down completely, and this the Guardian never did. I sat close 
to him at dinner, I played at his feet at the endless Councils, he, 
instead of my nurse, would take me into the courtyard for my daily romp 
among the trees. I grew up basking in the attentions of the most powerful 
ruler on the face of the earth and taking it all for granted. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I was only subconsciously aware 
of it, but I missed my mother more deeply that I imagined. She appeared 
in my mind’s eye just as the sun began to set and twilight began to 
eat the daylight skies. She came into my dreams and sang the songs that 
have been passed down from royal mother to daughter for generations. 
Several times, she played a musical instrument that is often given to 
just-beginning child musicians – an ocarina. I can guess what the 
reader of these memoirs is thinking, “It is the Ocarina of Time spoken 
of in the legends.” </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It is true. When my mother 
had it, it was already at least twelve hundred years old, give or take 
a few centuries. It is on display in the throne room of the castle I 
live and rule in now. No one touches it but for the special occasion 
when the marriage of the Hero of Time and our first Queen Zelda is celebrated 
every year. The Ocarina of Time is also played at the weddings of any 
pureblood Hylian royal. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">These night-visions were awash 
in pure-voiced music, my mother’s laughter, and slowly spoken words 
of comfort. Whatever solace these dreams yielded, they were never enough 
to substitute for the actual presence of my mother. </font></p>
 <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I am convinced now that it 
is absolutely necessary for a young woman to have a female mentor, or 
older woman-friend upon whom to rely on if a mother is gone. These I 
did not have, and even though events of the recent past have turned 
me into a stronger, more compassionate woman, I know that there was 
something missing in my growing up years. Without my mother, I grew 
up with a sore deficit.</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As I slowly changed from child 
into young woman, the hole in my heart continued to widen and hurt more 
with each passing year. The arrival of new hormones in my teen-aged 
body only worked to deepen my self-pity, and among my worst habits was 
wallowing for hours in angst. I filled many of hours bemoaning the tragedy 
of my life to my bewildered handmaids, creating a worldview for myself 
in which everything was either dark and sinister or meaningless. I was 
often found to be moping about the palace. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There was no real reason for 
my self-pitying. Yes, my mother left for the Immortal’s Plane, but 
my father was as loving as ever towards me and I continued to be enthralled 
with him. With the exception of grieving my mother’s death, there 
was no one single cause of my anguish - now I attribute it to the typical, 
sordid group of emotions that seem to haunt the average teenager. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I derived only true relief 
from my grief when I was in my father’s loving presence, and I hope 
that I gave my father comfort as well. Even though I was not a child 
any longer and a smidgen beyond my father’s shoulder height, I loved 
to squeeze onto the throne beside him, just like when I was a small 
girl. I still called him Daddy, too. I know it thrilled his heart. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">He acted perturbed when I said, 
“Scoot over, Daddy!” I slowly dropped into the rigid throne seat, 
looked at him and said with a grin, “<i>That’s </i>

better!” But one day, he said, “Zelda, you will one day be on this 
throne. You will rule in my place when I am gone. Are you prepared for 
that day?” I did not answer his question. In my youthfulness, I brushed 
aside the tone of his words. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As I grew older and my body 
filled out from the “coltish” form, a number of suitors began their 
parade in front of my father and me. In the country of Hyrule, a Crown 
Princess cannot become Queen Protector until they are married. Until 
then, even if they inherit the throne but still are not married, they 
remain only a Ruling Princess. It seems that this situation would lend 
some measure of urgency, but we Hylian Royals take our sweet time when 
choosing a life-partner. We have no desire to spend the rest of our 
lives with someone who has toes that appear as small, flesh-toned snakes 
or who have ungodly habits. Still, we begin the examination of suitors 
early in most Royals’ teen-aged years. Where my suitors came from, 
and who asked them to my palace, I’ll never know. But one thing is 
certain: there was never a need for good entertainment when the “Parade 
of Suitors” began. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Or more to the point: when 
the “Parade of Potential Court Jesters” began. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My father and I sat on the 
throne together and watched the suitors stroll, stumble or strut forward 
to ask for my hand in marriage. I remember the feeling of being galled 
at the “strutters” and “strollers” – I wanted the carpet to 
suddenly curl under their unsuspecting feet and make the idiots fall 
flat on their face. The only thing that made the “Parade” tolerable 
was my special game with my father. As the unsuspecting suitors waltzed 
up, the fun began. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Would you look at that one, 
m’dear? His feet must be four furlongs in length, at <i>least</i>!” 
He whispered low.</font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I stifled giggles as best as 
I could, and my cheeks puffed out like a hungry squirrel’s. “Unladylike” 
snorts magnified embarrassingly behind my hand. My father’s commentary 
became worse.</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Goddesses’ bones! If that 
man isn’t the most gaudily dressed man alive…” my father paused 
and I looked at him to see if he would finish his sentence. He did. 
“I wonder, is that a live bird atop his head?” </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My regal reserve broke, my 
cheeks deflated, and I turned and howled into my father’s robes. He 
faced the suitors and pretended to look apologetic, but no one was fooled 
by his red face, strained with mirth. No one was fooled, but no one 
would dare condemn the King of Hyrule for tomfoolery, either. So the 
games continued. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Daddy took a deep breath, dismissed 
the suitor who carried what appeared to be a live bird of paradise in 
his hair, and motioned for the next suitor to come forward. It was mandatory 
that we had to listen to the suitors’ long-winded speeches about their 
“character as a husband,” but good heavens, they were boring!</font></p>
 <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My father waited for the man 
to lean his head back, close his eyes and begin his proclamation before 
the roasting started again. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“For the love of Nayru!” 
He said I’m surprised that man was able to walk in here! It looks 
like he might need to be rolled out if we feed him. Should we feed him, 
Zelda?” </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Why not?” I giggled in 
my throat, ineffectively trying to bring back a more serious demeanor. 
“He’s fit to be rolled whether we load a trough for him or not!”</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A silly game a fifteen-year-old 
daughter plays with her father, nothing more. But as I look back, this 
particular game did two things: One, it continued to affirm the love 
between my father and I. And two, it confirmed my growing desire for 
my own gender. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">How? As I’ve said before, 
I had no older female friend to look up to, no one to imitate; just 
my father, his knights, and councilors, all of whom were men. I rarely 
saw women among the courtiers. During my father’s rule, women were 
generally not allowed into the presence of the royal family unless they 
were servants. As the only girl in the household, I learned to copy 
a man’s behaviors more readily than creating female behaviors for 
myself. I dressed in a feminine manner, I acted as a tomboy the rest 
of the time. I certainly didn’t act as a tough rough-houser by any 
means, but I always understood that there was something fundamentally 
different inside me. </font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My desires for other women 
set me apart.</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I do not mean to sound selfish 
when I say this, but I believe that I am the only princess in the history 
of the Royal Family of Hyrule who has had a hunger for women of the 
same sex. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">At first, the realization wasn’t 
uncomfortable – I had not been told differently and there didn’t 
seem to be anything wrong about it.  Admittedly I had never told 
anyone these desires. While the realization inside my mind wasn’t 
uncomfortable, I had a sneaking suspicion that my confession would bring 
gasps and raised eyebrows. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Many times, I would notice 
a pretty servant girl and I would pay her a genuine compliment – her 
hair, her eyes, some feature she had that struck me as beautiful. She 
would blush, curtsy, thank me and scurry away. For a few years, that 
was all that happened. I would just notice other girls. </font></p>
 <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">About my seventeenth year, 
I began aching for more than just a curtsy and a respectful, quick dash 
back to the kitchens. I wanted her to meet my outstretched hand and 
gaze into my eyes. It didn’t happen. <i>Of course it wouldn’t.</i></font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But as my eighteenth birthday 
approached, my longings became stronger. I continued to smile and talk 
briefly with the few girls in the castle my age, whether they were servants 
or no. My father seemed to notice that I needed companions, and he invited 
some of his courtier’s daughters to join the court. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I tried to behave and hide 
my desires to the very best of my ability. This is something that I 
have noticed that teenagers are especially good at doing – assuming 
that everyone visual distance is observing them all day, every day of 
their lives. As a grown adult, I have lost this belief, but at the time 
I didn’t want to frighten them away or think I was behaving strangely, 
so I worked hard not to allow the girls see my eyes wandering over them. 
At that time, I was just curious to see what other females looked like. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">One night, as I was getting 
dressed for bed, my curiosity overcame me. I wasn’t about to expose 
anyone but myself to my “odd desires”, but I was curious as to how 
the female body looked. I slipped off my dress and shoes, loosed my 
hair and walked to the tall mirror in the corner of my room. </font></p>
 <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The sight of my own nakedness 
gave me a thrill that tingled in my tailbone. My skin was white with 
a peach tone to it. I slowly lifted my hands to my breasts and watched 
my reflection do the same. Those mounds of flesh were soft and cushy, 
but smaller than I had really wanted them to be. I took note that all 
the courtier’s daughters had much larger breasts. Still, I wasn’t 
completely dissatisfied with my body. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My stomach was just as soft 
as my breasts, and I could hear my stomach gurgle as I massaged it. 
I studied the indention where I had been attached to my mother when 
I had lived in her womb. It wasn’t deep, but it was certainly long. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I took a deep breath, and my 
hand dipped to touch the thatchy curls between my legs. Something whispered 
in my ear that this was scandalous beyond measure, this touching of 
myself. I deliberately ignored “the little voice”. I argued with 
the voice answering that it was also scandalous not to know what your 
own body looks like under the layers of clothes that are worn daily. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The curls of my mons were light 
brown and coarse. I distinctly remember wondering what they were doing 
there – ‘Surely not as decoration,’ I thought. My tutors had taught 
me that every piece of my body served a purpose, but what is the purpose 
of these coarse curls? They cannot keep you warm, and they aren’t 
lovely to look at. As I studied my reflection, I wondered why I hadn’t 
looked at myself in this way before. ‘Had not known to do anything 
differently,’ I thought. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My hands prodded at the hips 
that curved outward and I contemplated them further. ‘Now <i>here</i> 

is a purposeful design,’ I thought. Obviously, these were intended 
to birth a baby later on in life. I laughed out loud at the thought. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I stepped back and looked at 
my body as a whole. Overall, it was slightly built, but not unattractive. 
I was pleased with what the Goddesses’ had blessed me with, even if 
a few spots could use some more filling out. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I turned from the mirror and 
picked up my favorite sheer nightgown, slipping it over my head with 
a touch of reluctance. I made sure to catch one last look at my still-budding 
breasts as the nightgown slid over their creamy texture; their light 
pinkness was tantalizing to my own eyes.  </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I blew out the candles in my 
room and lay down on the bed. I didn’t feel very sleepy, and I turned 
my head to look at the stars shining into my room. It was a beautiful 
night, and for a fleeting moment I wondered if there was someone out 
there for me. And if there was someone, were they looking into the same 
night sky?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New 
Roman">______________________________<WBR>______________________________<WBR>______</font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Three years went by. I grew 
from a gangly teenager into a woman. I tried to carry myself with power 
and grace, but over the years, my father slowly transferred the burden 
of his rulership over to me. All those gentle warnings I received from 
Daddy came true. I had not adequately prepared myself for the throne 
and now it was being thrust upon me. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Having acquired a new motivation, 
I pressed myself hard in my studies and readings, learning in a matter 
of months what normally takes years. I worked to learn every set of 
manners made for every situation. I did my best to memorize policies 
and laws and regulations. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But I continued to keep “my 
secret” away from everyone, including my father. What would I have 
been thought of then? To this day, I doubt that anyone would have understood 
and I refused to re-shoulder the burden of my attitude of my angst-ridden 
teenaged days. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It was no secret that my father’s 
health was failing. There were some days that he could barely lift his 
hand, but he would insist that he be dressed and serve his people as 
long and as best he could. Many mornings I would support his torso as 
he gritted his teeth and got out of bed as well as a sick man can. We 
called doctors in from every corner of the known world, but most of 
them said the most feared word: “Cancer”. </font></p>
 <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I had been nineteen just two 
weeks when my dear father was diagnosed with the fatal disease. There 
was nothing to be done, no treatment except fervent prayer. I prayed 
every day that if it was in the Goddesses’ Will to let my father live, 
that he would live a long life. But if it was Their Will for him to 
pass onto the next life, then he would go with little pain. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The year wore on, and it was 
plain that every movement, no matter how small, hurt him beyond description. 
He went to fewer of his Councils, and didn’t meet with his people 
in the throne room as often as he would have liked. More and more often, 
I went in his stead to hear the people’s complaints and the Councils. 
The <i>endless</i> string of Councils. The figurative weight of the 
crown was heavy, but I learned not to care. It meant that my father 
wouldn’t hurt as much. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">One night after a grinding 
day with meeting foreign dignitaries and discussing various polices 
for nearly six hours on end, I sat in my bedroom alone and stared out 
the window at the oncoming twilight. An echo from my past repeated the 
old story of the Twili.</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Daddy, why are the Twili 
a cursed race?”</font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“No one truly knows Zelda 
– the story is very old. But it is said that the Twili were once a 
people like us, with a King and a Queen and a little princess your age. 
But their society was a godless society. They did not worship the Goddesses 
as we do. They did not recognize the Goddesses’ handiwork in their 
lands and in their newborn babies. They cursed the Goddesses and said 
that they need them no longer. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Later, they created a god 
of their own. It was not a true god – how can a god created by human 
hands be any more omnipresent than the people who made him?</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“The Goddesses were tired 
of this race’s behavior, so They banished them to a place in another 
dimension that only saw Twilight – never true daylight, and never 
true night. As if that weren’t punishment enough, these people could 
never grow old, living in perpetual torment, without the escape of final 
death.”</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>How true was the legend, 
really? Myth or truth? </i>I rhythmically squeezed the sheets on my 
bed, rocking back and forth to an old nursery tune, trying to relax 
enough to fall into sleep. I gazed out at the velvety purple smoothing 
itself over silky gold and shimmery red. That particular evening was 
especially beautiful. Vivid sunsets have a way of chasing away the soreness 
in the shoulders and the troubles that puncture the soul. </font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I sighed and closed my eyes, 
letting the last bits of the sun touch my face and warm my clothed breasts. 
Just as I was about to lie back onto my mattress, I heard a whisper 
of wind. I instinctively opened my eyes and looked at the window where 
the sound seemed to be coming from. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. 
I lay on the bed and massaged my temples. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Suddenly, a pair of hot hands 
slid up my legs and gripped them. “I found you!” A female voice 
taunted. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I jumped up and kicked my legs, 
trying to get the hands loose. The hands let me go and I scrambled away 
to the furthest corner of the bed and with bated breath waited for the 
source of the voice and hands to show. “Where are you?” I called 
thinly, my own voice practically gone. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Here,” a sultry voice 
said softly. </font></p>
 <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A grown woman, blue skin, orange 
eyes and curious blue glowing marks all over her body rose up from underneath 
my bed. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I shook and stared at her whilst 
she gazed at me, almost lovingly. It was unmistakable what she was. 
‘<i>A Twili! </i>I thought<i>. A real Twili!</i> Senseless, I continued 
to shake and stare into her eyes. The woman clucked her tongue, as though 
she had more than enough time to spare. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The sound grated on my frazzled 
nerves. “Who are you?” I demanded. </font></p>
 <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Yes…how very rude of me 
not to introduce myself,” she said. “I am Midna, Princess of the 
Twilight.”</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She took my breath away. Princess 
Midna was beautiful beyond human words. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Why you are here? How did 
you get into my room? If you are a Twili, how is it that I cannot see 
only your shadow?” I asked. I was beginning to feel stronger. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She looked at me with a deadpan 
expression. “One question at a time, my sweet Crown Princess,” she 
said succinctly. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I am here because there 
is trouble brewing in my home.” She looked about my room as though 
sizing it up. “I am looking for someone who will help me drive out 
a <i>most</i> bothersome ‘advisor’ of mine named Zant.” She spit 
out the name “Zant.” </font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She cocked her head and gave 
me a menacing grin. My whole being recoiled – she was as terrifying 
as she was beautiful. “How do I appear not as shadow in your Light 
world?” She asked. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I nodded, wanting her to continue, 
but not daring to break from the suction of her eyes. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Well, that’s for me to 
know and for you to find out, yes?” She leaned her head back, closed 
her eyes and laughed in her throat, rolling her head luxuriously. I 
wasn’t about to press her for more of an answer, but my heart beat 
painfully when she broke our gaze. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“As for coming into your 
room…” Midna looked about and her eyes settled suggestively on the 
bed. “I use an ancient magic begun my ancestors to warp to and fro 
wherever I desire. The only reason I’m out of my world is because 
Zant,” she spat the name again, “evicted me.”</font></p>
 <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“He…evicted you? If he 
is as you say, an advisor, then he shouldn’t have the power to do 
that. You need to go back and execute him like the treasonous criminal 
he is,” I said in shock. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Yes, well, I already tried 
that and it’s the reason why I was thrown out of the Twilight Realm.” 
That was the first time she called her home the “Twilight Realm”. 
It sounded like an echoing gong in my ears and a whisper of foretold 
doom came with it. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Twilight</i>. <i>A world 
of eternal half-day-half-night, tempered by a mockery of true dimensions 
– the holy Immortals’ Plane and the Mortals’ Plane. </i></font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I must have been staring at 
her too long, because she abruptly put a fist on her hip and said pointedly, 
“You do have rooms for traveling royalty, do you not?”</font></p>
 <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I shook out of my thoughts. 
“We do. If you desire, the chambers next to mine are prepared and—“</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I don’t think so,” the 
Princess Midna sharply exclaimed. “What would be said if someone saw 
me? I did not arrive with an entourage and come in through the front 
gates. I would be immediately arrested.” </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You wouldn’t!” I said, 
trying to argue. “I would explain what happened and there wouldn’t 
be any more trouble.” </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“No, I must hide.” Midna 
replied. “I have Zant and his minions tearing in their path apart 
everything they see looking for me and it won’t do for me to be visible. 
I’ll stay here.” Midna looked down towards my bed. <i>My </i>
bed. I never had to share anything my whole life and if she decided 
to settle into my room… well, this would be something to get used 
to.  Neither did I say she couldn’t stay in room, in my bed. </font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">While I observed her shuffling 
about, her last statement rang in my mind. “Why is your advisor looking 
for you? And how did he acquire an army?” </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“It’s no army to speak 
of, hardly,” she said with a curled lip. “He thinks he was destined 
to sit on the throne of the Twilight, but he couldn’t lead a pack 
of cuccos if his life depended on it. He has been and will always be<i> </i>
a follower.”</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She turned to look at her reflection 
in the mirror. Princess Midna straightened, smiled and smoothed her 
gown over her hips, allowing her curves to come through. My mind went 
white – she was <i>beautiful. </i></font></p>
 <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She must have noticed my face. 
She suddenly began talking again. “Oh…I didn’t answer your last 
question,” she said casually. “He wants me in his alleged grip because 
I have something he just cannot live without.”</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna slowly raised her arm 
above her head and pointed at an object sitting on her head. I won’t 
lie – my first thought was, ‘How unbelievably ugly.’ The thing 
was in deplorable condition and appeared to be made of some metal. Rusted 
over, maybe? Clearly, it was broken – it arched up to a pair of rounded 
points and on either side of the headband were jagged edges. I wanted 
to ask why it was broken but it had an ominous, foreboding feel to it, 
so I didn’t ask.  </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She let me look at it for a 
long time. I finally spoke, “What is that?” </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna arched an eyebrow and 
cocked her head. “What is that?” She mimicked, and I frowned. She 
laughed aloud at my expression and the sound threw sensuous chills down 
my back. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She touched it again. “It 
is a part of something my people called the Fused Shadows,” she said. </font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I had heard of that. The legend 
of the Twili briefly mentioned the “created god” that the pre-Twili 
race had created. If – and that was a large if – the myth was true, 
the Fused Shadow was <i>the </i>same manmade god the ancient race had 
created. If the whole story were actually true, the Fused Shadow held 
a power that could still be awakened when the right “keys” were 
turned. What those “keys” were the legend never said and no Hylian 
could remember. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna shifted her weighted, 
continued to stare at me and gargled quietly. ‘Obnoxious,’ I thought 
but would never have said aloud. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“How long will you have to 
stay here?” I asked. Memories of “the legend” aside, I was still 
in complete awe of this beautiful Twili woman. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna shrugged and sat on my 
bed. “I honestly don’t know. I’ll have to leave during the nighttime 
to find whoever might be able to help me. While I can stay for a short 
amount of time in the Light, I cannot stay long. Night is the easiest 
on my body. I will also have to find somewhere to sleep during the day, 
so I shall return during the daytime,” she proclaimed. </font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I drew a deep breath through 
my nostrils and slowly let it go back out through my mouth. I couldn’t 
entertain a foreign dignitary from another dimension – the situation 
probably couldn’t have gotten worse. “This isn’t a good time. 
My father is extremely ill and I have been taking many of the responsibilities 
of the throne. It has been difficult beyond—“</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You are the Crown Princess 
of Hyrule. Did you think you would rest on a bed of laurels? You cannot 
live your whole life pampered and pleased in the loftiest tower of an 
ivory castle.” Midna snapped. I became acutely aware of her glare 
aimed at me. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My breath caught in my throat 
at the sight of that intensity. It was enough to freeze the blood in 
my veins and cook my brain into mush. It made my skin crawl in horror. 
I wanted the soft, beautiful eyes again. When I saw the soft eyes, I 
could imagine, just for a brief moment, that she was attracted to me. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I was so desperate for a woman’s 
attention then. </font></p>
 <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna must have seen my reaction, 
because her eyebrows lifted. I broke the gaze and looked at the mirror 
that watched our communion. In my mind’s eye, I saw the young girl 
that had looked at her body in that mirror, and I suddenly longed to 
do it again. I was overcome with weariness, strong emotions and my thoughts 
were a terrific jumble. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I understand now that I was 
feeling the pangs of first love, but I had to get away from those powerful 
emotions. I needed a breath and not just literally. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Just as I was about to turn 
away and murmur that I had to go visit my father, Midna widened her 
eyes as she looked into the mirror. I met the gaze in our reflection 
and my own eyes widened. I realized with a stunned sensation that she 
had made a decision, and I hadn’t any idea what it could be.</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The Princess Midna slowly turned 
and came close and held the back of my head with one hand. She sent 
a touch of magic from between two fingers into my eyes – the feeling 
was so painful I choked and collapsed. My head would have crashed to 
the floor if Midna had not caught me. She laid a hand over my eyes and 
I clawed at them. “What are you doing? Stop this!” I gasped. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She held her hand firmly over 
my eyes and cradled my head to her breast. “It will be over in a minute, 
I promise. You will no worse for the wear,” she said. </font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I continued to struggle but 
I didn’t have the strength of a small child. “Please, what are you 
doing?” I whispered. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“It’s almost over,” Midna 
said, rocking me back and forth. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New 
Roman">______________________________<WBR>______________________________<WBR>______</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>My mind’s eye saw a rolling 
comet of blue and orange fire heading straight for my face. It touched 
me, and I was surprised at how comfortable the flames were. It caressed 
my face and softly sang words of comfort, but I squeezed my eyes shut. 
I couldn’t understand why or how 
I was fighting.  </i></font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>“Princess…open your 
eyes…”</i></font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>My eyelids remained 
tightly closed. “I’m afraid,” I said. It sounded as though my 
voice came from a place miles and miles away. </i></font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>“You’ve lived in secrecy 
all your life. You’ve learned to hide. But this fear 
cannot last,” the voice said. I finally recognized it as Midna’s.</i></font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>“But when will I no 
longer be frightened?” I cried. </i></font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>“NOW!” 
Midna said. My eyes flew open and the comet penetrated my eyes. My hands 
shook – someone restrained them. I felt the comet’s freezing fire 
wriggle through my brain and I cried with the pain. </i></font></p>
 <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>The pain 
left, the moment was past. </i></font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>I stood on a pale, illuminated 
bridge over a shallow lake of water. </i></font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Midna stood mere inches 
away from me. “Now…was that so awful?” She said gently. She had 
a beautiful smile on her face and stroked my arms with warm fingers. </i></font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>“It was painful, but it 
didn’t last long. What exactly did you do?” I asked. </i></font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>“I created a bridge between 
our minds. We can talk to each whenever we desire. We can also feel 
each other’s emotions.” Midna replied. </i></font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>“Why 
is that needed?” I asked.</i></font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Her smile changed into one 
with a touch of wickedness. Her touch on my arms cooled ever so slightly. 
“You will see my Princess…you will see…”</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New 
Roman">______________________________<WBR>______________________________<WBR>______</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I awoke a few hours later on 
my bed. I bolted upright and looked around the room for Midna, but she 
was nowhere to be found. </font></p>
 <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The night was black outside 
my window, not a star was in the sky. I felt as though my senses had 
been utterly raped and I wondered if the whole thing had been a dream. 
An unusually realistic dream at that. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My first thought was my father 
and I dashed out my room to see him. When I arrived, he laid abed but 
was visibly worse. His face was a frightening yellow, his eyes were 
too bright, and he couldn’t lift his head or hands. Daddy turned to 
me as I entered the room. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Are you feeling any better?” 
I asked, tucking the blankets closer around his chin. It was an unnecessary 
question, my question was unnecessary and we both knew it. We knew he 
was dying. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">He didn’t answer my question. 
What was the use? “Zelda, your eyes – they are so different,” 
he said. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“What do you mean, Daddy?” 
I asked. </font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Look in the mirror,” he 
answered with great effort. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I did. My heart skipped several 
beats and leaped into my throat. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My blue eyes appeared as though 
they were on fire. <i>They were changed</i>.</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I looked to my father for help. 
“I’m sorry…I should have known better…what can I do?…why do 
they look that way?...why is this happening?...” My words tumbled 
out in an incoherent avalanche. </font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Be calm, child, be calm,” 
he answered My father motioned me to come close to him. I laid my head 
on his chest and listened to his watery lungs labor to get air. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“There is a legend that has 
been passed down for centuries. I have not related it to you nor to 
anyone else. Your mother would have spoken of it if she lived. In the 
end, it was the Goddesses’ Will that she pass on at the time she did.” 
He worked to draw a breath. ‘If he talks too much, it may well kill 
him.’ I thought, but he continued. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“It has been said that there 
will be a Princess of the Light and a Princess of the Twilight who will 
bridge the gap between our two races. It has also been said that these 
two Princesses of such different natures will love each other more deeply 
than anyone could imagine.” My father looked at me pointedly. I immediately 
understood then that he was aware of my “unnatural longings”. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">He had known all along and 
he didn’t love me one ounce less because of the knowledge. </font></p>
 <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A lump in my throat rose and 
tears threatened to overtake my vision, but I strained to hear his next 
words. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“My time to pass on is at 
hand, Zelda. You have done well in ruling in my stead. I have many of 
my advisors coming to me saying they have never seen such a steady hand 
in someone your age ruling the people of Hyrule. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“They assure me that you 
are doing well, but I already knew that you would. You inherently wield 
the strength and Wisdom to rule this kingdom.” His breaths came in 
shorter and shorter gasps. I lifted my head. ‘It can’t be happening, 
it’s too soon,” my mind screamed. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I still have so much to 
learn, Daddy. I’m too young to rule, and I’m certainly too young 
to lose you.” I said, bringing tears to my eyes. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You will grow up so much 
in the next year, I promise you. And at the end, you will look back 
and see much pain, but you will also see enough joy to drown out the 
sorrows.” My father stroked my back with his last bit of strength. </font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I…wish…you…well…” 
He said. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And he crossed over. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New 
Roman">______________________________<WBR>______________________________<WBR>______</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I sobbed on his chest for hours. 
One of Daddy’s servants found me and carried me back to my bedroom, 
but by then it was morning. I was inconsolable. Nothing could patch 
up the pain, the tears in my heart. Nothing could bring back my Daddy. 
It hurt. Goddesses, it hurt!</font></p>
 <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">One of Daddy’s most trusted 
advisors made the announcement to Hyrule that the King had passed away. 
“Long live our Regent Queen Zelda!” the people said quietly after 
the advisor had made the proclamation. I stood behind the advisor, veiled 
from head to toe in somber black. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In the days following my father’s 
death, I did everything I could to avoid the inevitable grief. I picked 
at my food and drink and avoided sleep. I found small comfort in practicing 
with the sword and bow and arrows my mother left me, writing new policies 
and Council notes. I cut taxes and added new ones. I began work on a 
new highway and bridge that was built between Kakariko Village and Hyrule’s 
Castle Town. I had allowed for the initial sting of death to set into 
me, but I did not allow any time for the healing grief that <i>must</i> 
come sometime after the extinguished life of one so loved. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In a shell, I completed the 
duties required of me, forcing myself to continue. I wanted nothing 
more than to bury myself in the sheets, blankets, and pillows of my 
bed and stay there for the next seven years. I desired the seven year 
sleep the ancient Hero of Time once had. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Yet duty pushed me forward, 
the world could not stop turning for my father’s death. I couldn’t 
let my people down now, not with such a monumental transition of power. 
While a woman on throne was not looked down upon, it was certainly different, 
and this was made obvious on the faces of the people as they came to 
see me to voice their cases. They talked as though I were a simple child 
and used small words. I often became short and irritated with my new 
subjects, and cut my hearing sessions before they were supposed to end. </font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In the dust cloud of activity, 
I almost forgot about the Princess Midna. The only thing that reminded 
me of her was the illuminated bridge that appeared every time I closed 
my eyes and rolled back into my subconscious. Much of the time, the 
area surrounding the bridge was silent, but there were the rare occasions 
when I distinctly heard faint singing on the other bank – odd, tribal 
melodies in a language I couldn’t understand. I always wanted to cross 
that bridge, but couldn’t name the force that held me back. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I know what that “nameless” 
thing is now: fear. I felt fear in seeking comfort from others – from 
Midna, really – when I did not feel I could give myself or anyone 
else any. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">After an especially long and 
tiring day, I came into my quarters, shut the door and began mechanically 
eating the food that had been laid out before me. I didn’t bother 
to put off my shoes, I couldn’t feel anything physical anymore. There 
was nothing to heal the enormous pain that left my heart in shreds. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A whisper of wind sounded in 
my ears. I turned my head towards the window from which the wind came 
from and there the Twilight Princess stood. </font></p>
 <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She walked with measured steps 
to me. “I deeply am sorry for your loss, Regent Princess.” She took 
my hands in hers, raised them to her lips and lightly kissed the knuckles. 
Immediately, I knew my body wasn’t <i>entirely</i> dead – the first 
shivers of arousal made me aware of that. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Please call me Zelda,” 
I said lowly. “It seems that we will be getting to know each other 
very well soon.”</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna did not appear to have 
an answer and sat down in a chair across from me, watching my face. 
I wiped my eyes on the sleeve of my gown and sniffed. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Have you found the one you 
seek to help you return your kingdom?” I asked. Midna shook her head. 
She explained to me during her previous visit that the only way she 
could be restored to her throne in the Twilight world was to find the 
Blessed Hero Beast that her culture’s legends spoke of. Midna gave 
me a bare bones description of the legend, but I filled in the blanks. </font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Zant’s servants have been 
chasing me all over Hyrule, and they’ve nearly captured me several 
times,” Midna said. “I’m being forced into another plan.”</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Where do you sleep during 
the daytime?” I asked. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“In the darkest place I can 
find. There are lots of those kinds of places, Zelda, and you have many 
of them throughout your kingdom,” she said, looking at me meaningfully. 
Midna allowed silence to briefly reign and I tried to relieve the tension 
by putting a few bites of food in my mouth. I swallowed quietly and 
felt my throat expand and contract. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“How has keeping a world 
on its toes been?” Midna suddenly asked. It occurred to me how strange 
it was for her to be so curious about my well-being. ‘Then again,’ 
I thought. ‘It’s strange for me to be talking to her in this way. 
It’s only the second time I’ve seen her.’</font></p>
 <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“I just live day to day,” 
I wearily answered. “Some days I live hour to hour. It’s all I can 
do to get up in the mornings and I’d rather not eat,” I dropped 
my fork onto the table. “I don’t believe I want to be alive anymore,” 
I whispered. My grief was at the point too deep and powerful for tears.</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna regarded me carefully 
and then came to kneel before me. I was shocked. <i>The ruler of another 
kingdom kneels before me?</i></font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She put her hands on my knees, 
and for some reason, I wasn’t uncomfortable at all. I pushed aside 
the food tray and leaned forward to look into her orange eyes.</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Then…<i>then…</i></font></p>
 <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">...I knew I loved her. I was 
past the point of no return, I was in love at last. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna spoke. “It <i>is</i> 
worth it being alive. Let me show you.” She gave me a devilish grin 
and pulled me up from my chair. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Midna touched her fingers to 
my stomach and slowly slid her hands over my breasts, up my shoulders 
and finally cradled my head as she kissed me fully on the mouth. My 
mind was shaken to the core with shock, but I kissed her right back. </font></p>
 <br> <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Some time later, we stared 
at the canopy hanging above my bed. </font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“How long have you had that 
awful strip of cloth?” Midna asked, her hand stroking my bare back. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Mmmm…for as long as I 
can remember. Why does it matter?” I asked and buried my nose into 
her naked breast. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Because it has a circus 
scene on it. That’s not very fitting of a grown <i>woman</i>, now 
is it?” Midna said. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I shook my head in agreement, 
reveling in the warmth of our bodies touching. I was still trying to 
catch my breath.</font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She had shown me everything. 
Midna had shown me where my hands could touch, how light or heavy their 
touch could be, and how fast they could work to bring mind-boggling 
delight. Best of all, she showed me how my body could respond to these 
touches. Her ministrations were lovely and brought tears to my eyes. 
I quickly learned that while she had a dry sense of humor and tended 
to have an attitude on the sharp side, she had a tenderness that would 
soften stone. This was the healing that I craved. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I stretched and began to get 
out of bed. I wondered if I could fit one more policy draft into my 
day, but Midna apparently had other ideas. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Just where do you think 
you’re going, Zelda? We aren’t done, not by a long shot.” She 
grabbed my waist, digging her fingernails into me. I gasped as I fell 
back onto the bed. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She cradled me and I kissed 
her face over and over. </font></p>
 <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“My Rose-elda.” She murmured. 
So were at the point of our relationship to have nicknames? I tried 
to think of a good nickname for her and said aloud the first one to 
come to mind. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Middie,” I laughed. She 
lightly slapped my bottom. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“You will not breathe that 
nickname outside of this room, do you <i>hear</i> me?” She said firmly. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The mirth couldn’t stop spilling 
from my heart. It just felt so good to laugh, and loving someone made 
me giddy. Realizing that she loved me back made my heart feel grown 
twice as large. </font></p>

 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I watched Midna’s face soften. 
“That will be my name for you, but only when we are entirely alone,” 
I said.</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Absolutely not!” Midna 
protested. “Walls in buildings and trees in forests have a way of 
gaining ears! If word were to get back to Zant, or anyone for that matter—“</font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Then we will just not let 
that happen,” I said, putting a finger across her mouth. </font></p>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She sighed and laid her head 
on my breast. I grinned. I won. </font></p>
