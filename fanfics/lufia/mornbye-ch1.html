<h1>With Morning Comes Goodbye</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../lufia/index.html">Lufia</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dkerr.html">David Kerr</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Guy. Selan. The two of you are destined to travel with Maxim and fight. 

-------------- 

Iris approached the bed in the pitch-black of night. The bed where that 
girl slept. That conniving, destructive, possessive girl. That selfish 
girl. That weak girl. That beautiful girl. 

Tia, she reminded herself, her name&#39;s Tia. She pulled back the covers on 
the bed to reveal a sleeping blue-haired beauty. Or rather, that&#39;s what 
was supposed to happen. Tia, now uncovered, lunged at Iris with a 
serrated dagger. It would have pierced the heart, Iris realized, had she 
not teleported two metres away. 

&quot;You bitch,&quot; Tia whispered hoarsely, her gaze piercing the darkness. 
Seeing her eyes, Iris could guess that Tia spent the night crying. 

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; Iris asked, surprised by the accusation. &quot;I think that&#39;s 
just a bit unprovoked...&quot; 

Tia growled. &quot;You&#39;re stealing him from me! You&#39;re ruining my life!&quot; Tia 
slashed at the air with her dagger, making Iris unconsciously take a 
step backward. All her time, all her training, and she felt threatened 
by the petite blue-haired girl? It was only a knife, after all. 

Iris dropped her head contemptibly. &quot; No, Tia. Listen. I&#39;m not stealing 
Maxim. No one is. He&#39;s destined to fight. I&#39;m not making him fight, I 
just opened his eyes to fate.&quot; 

Damned, Tia thought begrudgingly, if I let this bitch show me up. She 
roughly pulled the whip from her belt and lashed at the lamp on her 
side. Barely able to see it, she destroyed the bulb and left the rest 
unscathed. &quot;I can fight!&quot; she shouted. I can fight! 

Iris sighed. Would the girl ever get it? It hurt to see Tia pained like 
this. Iris wished she could comfort the girl, stroke that gentle blue 
hair. Somehow take all Tia&#39;s pain away. &quot;I know you can fight,&quot; she 
groaned. &quot;But, you&#39;re different.&quot; You don&#39;t know how different. &quot;Your 
power levels are as high as any human being can have. But Maxim, he&#39;s 
different. He&#39;s the only one with the power, along with Guy, and 
Selan--&quot; 

&quot;--Selan,&quot; Tia spat. Iris&#39; heart leapt at the vulgarity in Tia&#39;s voice 
when she mentioned Selan&#39;s name. As much as she didn&#39;t like doing it, 
Iris realized the only way to get near Tia would be to play off that 
hatred. 

&quot;Yes!&quot; she shouted, &quot;It&#39;s her fault. Selan&#39;s stealing Maxim!&quot; Iris knew 
what she was about to do could alter fate. She reminded herself that she 
had to fight Selan as Erim, and nothing could get in the way of that. 

&quot;What do you know?&quot; Tia asked quizzically, letting the whip fall from 
her hand and sitting on the bed. Iris let her eyes wander up and down 
Tia&#39;s body once. She had obviously been expecting a confrontation; she 
was still in her battle pants, and high boots. However, obviously not 
wanting to be totally uncomfortable--or obvious--she was just wearing a 
bra on her upper body, revealing and hiding a beautiful upper body at 
the same time. 

Iris shook her lustful thoughts from her mind and concentrated. She let 
her thoughts transcend time-space, wandering the intricate webbing of 
the universe. She knew that just predicting the future could change it, 
but now she didn&#39;t care. She almost had to laugh--Arek would scold her, 
saying that she&#39;d been spending too much time with the humans. 

&quot;She&#39;ll bear his child,&quot; Iris said finally, raising an emotional 
response from Tia. She watched as the blue-haired girl dropped her face 
in her hands. A small sob, and Iris flinched. She decided to go on; &quot;A 
boy. Jeros.&quot; 

&quot;Such a beautiful name,&quot; Tia sobbed, wiping tears from her eyes. &quot;I&#39;m 
sure he&#39;ll...be as...kind as Ma...Maxim...&quot; Iris knelt down in front of 
Tia and brushed away a plastered-down lock of blue hair. 

&quot;Sshh, shh. You&#39;ll find someone for you. It&#39;s just a matter of time.&quot; 

&quot;No!&quot; Tia whispered, suddenly conscious of the rest of the inn, and 
ultimately, Maxim. &quot;Maxim was the one for me. We were supposed to live 
together peacefully. I was supposed to have his child. I love him!&quot; 

&quot;You can learn to love another,&quot; Iris said, almost suggestively. Tia 
cocked an eyebrow. 

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; she asked. She was answered when Iris leaned 
forward, her green hair falling across her face, and pressed her lips to 
Tia&#39;s. Tia leaned back, giving in to Iris&#39; lust. 

--- 

Opening her eyes, Iris yawned contentedly. She had just had one of the 
best nights of her life. Of course, the morning might not go so great, 
she thought, taking note of the piece of paper on the pillow where Tia 
should have been. 

Rubbing fatigue from her eyes, she sat up and looked at the piece of 
paper: 

Iris. I&#39;m sorry. I was depressed last night, and let whatever 
happened...happen. Maxim is and will always be in my heart, and that is 
something I cannot change. I&#39;m sorry that whatever you feel for me 
cannot ever come to fruition. Were I a different person, maybe I could 
indulge your...tastes...but I fear I cannot get around myself. I do love 
him, and I&#39;m afraid that if I stay here, with you or with him, that I&#39;ll 
disrupt the way things are meant to be. Thank you for opening my eyes to 
glimpse the future, even if it wasn&#39;t my own sight. I wish you well, and 
hope we can both find someone for ourselves. 

A knock came at the door, followed by an attractive red-haired male. He 
stopped short when he saw a green-haired Iris sitting cross-legged on 
the bed, sobbing. Gods damn it, she thought. 

Maxim looked around, then stared a hole into Iris. &quot;Where&#39;s Tia?&quot; he 
asked, confused. Almost in response, the woman started to glow purple. 
&quot;Iris? Where&#39;s Tia?&quot; 

&quot;Warp.&quot;
