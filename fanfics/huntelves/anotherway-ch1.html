<pre>&quot;Well THAT was a disaster,&quot; Junpei Ryozoj sighed, the
tall, muscular black haired man wincing as they sat in
the shadow of the tank. While mostly unharmed he had
taken quite a beating, at least as far as his ragged
clothes showed.

&quot;I told you,&quot; Celcia said crossly, the little humanoid
dog waving her arms, &quot;that village is women only!&quot;

&quot;We could force our way into town to find the elf,&quot;
Ritsuko Inoue offered, the younger redhead cleaning
her rifle thoughtfully. The school girl and military
otaku didn&#39;t seem to have any problems with that idea,
in fact her eyes seemed to gleam with anticipation.

&quot;That might be overreacting a bit,&quot; Airi Komiyama said
mildly, the black haired actress thoughtfully looking
out at the village through the trees.

&quot;Besides,&quot; Junpei quietly noted, &quot;as much as I like a
good fight, taking on all those women was a pain.&quot;

&quot;They kick places boys won&#39;t,&quot; Celcia noted with some
amusement.

Junpei winced.

&quot;I&#39;m going down into the village,&quot; Airi said after
some thought, &quot;to scout around. If I&#39;m not back by
tomorrow, come get me.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Junpei sat up, wincing a bit.

Airi smiled slightly, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be
fine.&quot;

The village was a busy place, with people hurrying
back and forth on their business and every one a
women. Airi walked among them with confidence,
expressing a sense that she belonged there, and with
practiced ease blended in with the crowd to listen in
to conversations. Her eyes observant she scanned the
people, getting a sense of what was going on and how
they related to each other.

&#39;I haven&#39;t felt this kind of vibes since I visited
Provincetown on a tour,&#39; Airi thought with some
amusement, seeing the women holding hands, chatting
together happily and looking at each other tenderly.

&quot;Greetings, newcomer,&quot; a woman practically purred as
she walked up to Airi, looking her over with obvious
interest. &quot;I&#39;m the town&#39;s sheriff,&quot; she introduced
herself, long blonde hair gleaming, &quot;Katsura.&quot;

&quot;Katsura, it&#39;s nice to meet you,&quot; Airi shook the
woman&#39;s hand, aware of how the lady let her touch
linger, squeezing just a bit then reluctantly letting
go. &quot;My name is Airi,&quot; she said in her own best purr.

&quot;Welcome to Sapphia,&quot; Katsura said as she lead them
towards a fountain nearby, the rim of the pool large
enough to sit. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but we had some trouble
earlier with a foolish giant,&quot; she asked with a
slightly wary look, &quot;you wouldn&#39;t know about that,
would you?&quot;

Airi decided playing dumb was best, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I
haven&#39;t encountered him.&quot; Her eyes shining with
innocence she asked, &quot;What does it look like?&quot;

&quot;He, actually,&quot; Katsura said wryly, &quot;large,
musclebound and brainless.&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t most men?&quot; Airi joked.

&quot;True,&quot; Katsura chuckled. She shifted a bit, giving
Airi a thoughtful look, &quot;So what brings you to our
town?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to visit,&quot; Airi lied with ease,
&quot;especially from the many things that I heard about
it.&quot;

&quot;We do have a reputation,&quot; Katsura agreed, her eyes
amused. She got up reluctantly, her simple leggings
clinging to well formed legs, &quot;We have a nice tavern
and inn you could say in, if you need a place to
stay.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll think about it,&quot; Airi promised.

A slow smile teased Katsura&#39;s lips as she added, &quot;They
even have a elven dancer who preforms in the
evenings.&quot;

&#39;Well isn&#39;t that interesting?&#39; Airi thought as she
promised to check it out.

Scouting around the town for the next hour, seeing the
sighs while searching soon confirmed Airi&#39;s initial
impression. While there were a fair number of females
there were no elves out and about, and chatting with
the residents turned up no sign either. Therefore, it
looked like stopping in at the tavern would be a good
idea.

In sharp contrast to the softly glowing evening sun
the inside of the tavern was dim, cool as the young
women sat around tables, talking. The scent of good
food came from the kitchen, beer and booze flowed and
there was a oddly comfortable atmosphere within.

The conversation slowed as Airi entered, much like in
any small town bar, but soon picked up as she found
her way to a empty table. Sitting down she did another
quick elf check as the waitress sauntered over, then
smiled at the redhead in welcome

&quot;Anything I can get you?&quot; the perky redhead asked.

&quot;Beer, for now,&quot; Airi smiled.

&quot;I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; the waitress said, proving true
to her word as she returned with the beer. &quot;Good
timing,&quot; she added as she set the glass down, &quot;Ezri&#39;s
show is about to start.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Airi payed then waited eagerly for the
show to start.

As a flutist in the corner began to play softly, the
door to the kitchen swung open to reveal a tall, slim
figure. Her long, blue green hair shimmered in the
torch light, the thin gown she wore clinging to her
body&#39;s graceful curves. Her eyes were soft and gentle,
while the points of her ears clearly showed her elven
heritage.

&#39;She&#39;s beautiful,&#39; Airi thought, feeling a bit
surprised to find herself reacting to the girl&#39;s
unconcealed sensuality.

As the music played Ezri stalked gracefully between
the tables, her movements almost but no quite dancing
until the music shifted, becoming more urgent. With
that she began to sway in place not far from Airi,
twisting her body even as she tugged gracefully at the
scarf around her swan-like neck.

&#39;She isn&#39;t going to...&#39; Airi thought in surprise.

Yes, she was. Ezri removed the scarf, then undid her
belt. Swaying gracefully, the clasps of her tunic were
opened one by one, exposing more and more creamy white
flesh before it was finally shrugged off.

&#39;Well,&#39; a faintly blushing Airi thought as she looked
her pert breasts and shapely torso over, &#39;I now know
there&#39;s no spell marks on her upper body.&#39;

Dancing as the women cheered Ezri turned this way and
that, her eyes eventually falling on Airi&#39;s unfamiliar
face. With a curious look she smiled questioningly,
then began to strut towards the apparently older
woman&#39;s seat.

Airi actually gulped as Ezri neared, taking in the
perfection of her body and the sweet scent. &#39;Does she
know the sort of effect she has?&#39; she wondered.

Teasingly Ezri swayed closer then away from Airi, her
breasts bouncing slightly, the nipples hard from the
cooler air.. Or maybe from excitement. Swaying her
hips she reached teasingly for the clasp of her skirt,
tugging at the clip with a finger or two then
stopping, bringing on disappointed sounds from the
crowd.

Ezri&#39;s voice was musical as she stopped by Airi&#39;s
chair, &quot;The clasp seems to be stuck... could you help
me with it?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Airi kept her voice even, thought it took
some effort. Reaching out she brushed over the warm
skin of Ezri&#39;s bare belly, stroking bare skin
teasingly, then down to the offending clasp.

&quot;Oooh,&quot; Ezri gasped dramatically, her eyes twinkling
as Airi undid the skirt.

&quot;Tease,&quot; Airi murmured so that Ezri could only hear,
smiling as the elf lingered nearby.

&quot;Not always,&quot; Ezri whispered back, her gaze thoughtful
as she studied Airi. Gracefully she danced, her hands
now tugging slowly at her skirt, slowly drawing it
down to the crowd&#39;s cheers. Soon she wiggled free as
they cheered, revealing a tiny pair of panties that
hugged her mound like a second skin. Whirling the
skirt she tossed it carefully, draping it over Airi&#39;s
head and shoulders before she pulled the still warm
cloth off. Still dancing Ezri made her slow, teasing
way back to the kitchen, then was gone.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Airi murmured, slightly surprised by the
strength of her reaction to the woman&#39;s dance, the
power of her presence. The skirt, still in Airi&#39;s
hand, smells of flowers and a subtle, earthy scent
carried by the other woman&#39;s body. &#39;At least I know
the spell mark isn&#39;t on most of her body,&#39; she forced
her mind back on business, &#39;but how do I check...?&#39;

There was another cheer as Ezri emerged from the
kitchen once more, this time dressed in more casual
clothes. Smiling at well wishers and nodding to fans
she made her way across the tavern to arrive at Airi&#39;s
seat. &quot;May I?&quot; she gestured to the other seat at the
table.

&quot;Please do,&quot; Airi said. Now that Ezri wasn&#39;t
preforming she seemed more approachable, but there was
still a sexiness to her that drew Airi in. She met
those blue eyes and saw the interest in them towards
her, too, and felt a slight smile tease her lips.

Ezri smiled back, leaning forward even as she signaled
for a drink. &quot;So,&quot; she purred, &quot;what&#39;s a nice girl
like you doing in a bar like this?&quot;

Airi had to bite back a laugh, &#39;Yes, I think I&#39;ll be
able to check that last spot for the spell mark after
all.&#39;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0

The next morning Junpei looked up, feeling a flash of
relief as Airi returned to their hidden little camp.
&quot;Well?&quot; Celcia demanded impatiently, &quot;did you find the
elf?&quot;

A oddly satisfied smile was on Airi&#39;s face as she
said, &quot;Yes, I did. I&#39;m sorry to say there was no spell
mark, though.&quot;

&quot;What took you so long?&quot; Ritsuko asked as she ate a
can of military rations.

&quot;It does take some time to get someone out of their
clothes willingly,&quot; Airi said, her expression very
nearly devilish.

Junpei opened his mouth to ask how she had managed
it... then closed it with a snap. Somehow, he
suspected he really didn&#39;t want to know.

End

Notes: Poor Junpei, with his unrequited crush on Airi.
Heh. And I could SO see him bulling his way into a all
female village and getting into shit. I hope I haven&#39;t
offended any long tome TWHE fans, and that you&#39;ll
forgive my corrupting Airi a bit.
