<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/jetiendo-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>Ant and Dec walked into their classroom as the class was waiting for 
them Dec was horrified when he spotted posters of Grace from big brother 
7. Dec ripped that poster and replaced with Pete.

&quot;WHY HAVE YOU GOT A POSTER OF GRACE ADAMS-SHORT ON THE WALL&quot; Dec roared

&quot; She&#39;s my idol&quot; Davis shouted.

&quot;Yeah&quot; every one shouted out.

&quot;I CANT TAKE THIS.&quot; Dec shouted out &quot;EVERY ONE WRITE THIS IN YOUR BOOKS. 
GRACE ADAMS-SHORT IS A BIG BITCH!!!&quot;

&quot;Davis&quot; Ant said &quot; your punishment is to sing the song &quot;I got my head in 
my pants&quot;

&quot;WHAT&quot; Davis shouted out?

&quot;Teach you to throw Brussels sprouts at me&quot; Ant snapped. Ant put a pair 
of Rudolph musical pants on Davis&#39;s head and he had to sing it

I got my head in my pants I got a groovy disco trance

They where clean on just last week yeah, yeah baby look at me

I got my head in my pants just like they do in France

I got the knickers noodle boogie trance and dance in my pants

Davis sung it horribly and the class clapped. Simon Cowell walked in, it 
punished Simon Cowell&#39;s ears

&quot; I don&#39;t mean 2 b rude but that was absolutely horrible&quot; Simon Cowell 
said to Davis.
