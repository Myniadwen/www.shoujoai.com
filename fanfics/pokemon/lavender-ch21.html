<h1>Lavender Ghost Story (part 21 of 23)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nikolai.html">Nikolai Mirovich</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/lavender-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>&quot;The Chamber Of Lost Souls...&quot;

The rest of the day held few surprises, except that a thorough search of the 
town turned up no witnesses, and no tourists hiding large boxes of poke balls in 
their rooms. Even when Laurna had arranged for a few ghosts to check the Haunted 
Woods for human incursion, and all the old mineshafts in the mountains were gone 
through, there was no sign of the missing items. 

When Frank finally sat down long enough to have lunch, he did some quick 
research into the abilities of psychic pokemon; he was pleased to learn that 
even extremely talented teleporter&#39;s were limited by distance and mass. The more 
mass they had to move, the less the distance they could travel.   

&quot;They must still be in Lavender,&quot; he told Miranda when he&#39;d caught up to his 
niece and Misty as they followed the afternoon parade up to the festival 
grounds, &quot;But my people&#39;ve been all over town, and Laurna&#39;s had the ghosts check 
all the places they can&#39;t go.&quot;

&quot;Like the Tower?&quot; suggested Miranda.

&quot;Naw, we&#39;d know by now,&quot; Frank laughed.

&quot;Um, are they&#39;re any places that ghost&#39;s can&#39;t go?&quot; suggested Misty over the 
cacophony created by the crowds and the constant array of musical selections 
being played in various areas.

Frank rubbed his stubbly chin thoughtfully for a moment. &quot;None that I know of,&quot; 
he replied, &quot;But I&#39;ll have my people double check a few places like the harbor. 
I know that the Lilcamp vessels have their hulls lined with mithril, so maybe I 
should have some of my people actually go see for themselves. Ah well, so much 
for the polite approach.&quot;

&quot;Is there anything we can do to help?&quot; Miranda offered.

The Pokeforce Officer shook his head and smiled warily. &quot;Naw, that&#39;s alright,&quot; 
he assured them, &quot;It&#39;s only a matter of time. You two just have fun.&quot;

&quot;Sure, but what about you?&quot; his niece inquired with concern.

Frank chuckled and lowered the brim of his hat. &quot;Believe it or not, kid,&quot; he 
said with a grin, &quot;For me, this is fun. It&#39;s probably the only truly interesting 
crime that&#39;s ever going to happen here, and it&#39;d be no fun for me if I just 
solved it right off.&quot;

&quot;How&#39;s Laurna doing, though? And what about Bow?&quot;

&quot;Well, Laurna&#39;s off making calls,&quot; Frank explained with a shudder, &quot;She&#39;s 
feeling better now, and last I checked the trainers she&#39;s contacted are taking 
it pretty well all things considered. No one&#39;s freaked out on her or anything. 
And Bow&#39;s refused to leave Laurna&#39;s side since I let her loose again. Just as 
well, I suppose.&quot;

&quot;Makes me glad I don&#39;t send any of my pokemon in for storage,&quot; said Misty with a 
shudder, recalling the icy chill that ran through her when Miranda had explained 
the situation to her.

&quot;It&#39;ll teach the youngin&#39;s not to be so greedy, I guess,&quot; said Frank with a 
shrug as one of his people waved him over, &quot;Uh, look, I gotta get going. But I 
don&#39;t want to hear anything other than you two had a good time today, you hear 
me?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Uncle Frank,&quot; they both laughed in unison before watching him vanish in 
the crowd of people following the directions on a conveniently placed tombstone 
that proclaimed that something called the &quot;Chamber Of Lost Souls&quot; was now open 
for business.

&quot;That any good?&quot; inquired Misty as the crowd thinned.

Miranda chuckled. &quot;Naw,&quot; she replied with a dismissive wave of her hand, &quot;Last 
year it was just a circle of trailers strung together with some rather lame 
attempts at scaring people thrown in. All but one&#39;s just pitch black, and you 
have to follow the group or get lost. Took me three days to get the honey off my 
shoes from that first room the last time... And the last room just had a huge 
cauldron in the center. They seemed to think that boiling about a dozen pairs of 
used gym shorts in it would scare people. Well, the smell was pretty scary, 
but...&quot;

&quot;You know...&quot; Misty interrupted, grabbing both of Miranda&#39;s hands and pulling 
her in the direction of the with a mischievous smile, &quot;That still makes three 
very dark rooms that are very easy to get lost in. I think that might be a 
pleasant distraction, don&#39;t know?&quot; 

Miranda stammered for a moment, causing her lover to laugh. &quot;Well, why not,&quot; she 
said at last, unable to think of any adequate protest, &quot;Maybe those thieves are 
hiding those stolen pokeballs there and we&#39;ll find them.&quot;

&quot;Now, now,&quot; Misty laughed as she half-dragged Miranda into the line-up, &quot;No 
justifying. We both know what we&#39;ll find in there.&quot;

&quot;Each other?&quot; the courier asked rhetorically, her smile mischievous.

Misty then glanced around nervously, her smile betraying her embarrassment. &quot;You 
know,&quot; she whispered, leaning so close that her breath was hot against Miranda&#39;s 
ear, &quot;I do sorta have that little... Um...&quot;

&quot;Fetish?&quot; giggled Miranda, her arms reaching around Misty&#39;s waist and holding 
her in place as she leaned back, bowing her head and trying to hide her smile.

&quot;Yeah. That,&quot; Misty continued after making certain that no one was really paying 
any attention, &quot;I was just thinking that maybe this could be a bit of a prelude. 
Give me something to think about later tonight after we head home.&quot;

&quot;Goodness, milady!&quot; exclaimed Miranda teasingly before speaking in a hushed tone 
that she tried to make sound scandalized, &quot;Are you propositioning me?&quot;

Misty lifted her head, refusing to let herself be embarrassed further by her own 
thoughts. &quot;No,&quot; she whispered coyly, her cheeks feeling as thought they were on 
fire as she spoke, &quot;I&#39;m just going to take you aside once we&#39;re in there, and 
take advantage of you with all those people watching in the darkness.&quot;

&quot;And then what?&quot; Miranda asked teasingly as the line moved forward.

&quot;You&#39;ll see,&quot; Misty promised, &quot;Or rather, you won&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;And neither will they,&quot; added Miranda, taking her lover&#39;s hand and motioning to 
the people who&#39;d lined up behind them.

Misty smiled mischievously, placing her lips close to Miranda&#39;s ear once more. 
&quot;But if we&#39;re not quiet, they&#39;ll hear,&quot; she said, sending a shiver down her 
spine at the thought, &quot;We&#39;ll need to be extra quiet, you know. Not make any 
noise at all or we&#39;ll be caught. Hm... I wonder how much we can get away with?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re hurting me, dear,&quot; chuckled Miranda, causing Misty to look down and 
quickly apologize, not realizing that her free hand was anxiously clutching 
Miranda&#39;s arm quite so tightly, &quot;But I guess we&#39;ll see, eh?&quot;

Misty nodded; pleased to see how fast the line was going as they quickly neared 
the circle of four long structures, decorated with every Halloween clich? the 
proprietors could think of. The one at the forefront was made to resemble the 
&quot;standard&quot; haunted house, with a wooden wall attached to the roof to falsely 
provide a second level, and a wide front veranda that served as both a place for 
the ticket collector to stand, as well as a place for the animatronic zombie 
pokemon to flail their limbs and snap their jaws ineffectually at the crowd. 

Through the painted on windows of the foremost building there were images meant 
to put those in line into the right mood. One window depicted an ethereal 
looking woman in Victorian looking clothes who was holding her head in both 
hands, glaring down at the crowd imperiously. Another had a skeleton hanging out 
the widow brandishing a bloodied knife, his eye sockets filled by a pair of 
googly looking eyes that had been physically attached to the mural&#39;s face, 
making it seem more amusing than threatening. Still others depicted sinister 
looking zubats flying free of the broken, often cobweb filled windows, the 
sightless creatures made to look hungry for human vitae as they fled the horrors 
within. 

The other building that was visible from their vantage point, was painted to 
resemble a dark cave, with stalactites and stalagmites blocking most of their 
view of the characters painted upon it. They supposed that the heroic looking, 
burly man in ripped clothes fending off some tentacled monstrosity with a shot 
gun and a chainsaw was supposed to be one of the &quot;Chamber Of Lost Souls&quot; 
visitors. But as Miranda knew all too well, such attractions were usually more 
laughable than actually frightening.

As the two drew nearer, the now commonplace pre-recorded sounds of howling wind, 
creaking gates, and quiet screaming reached their ears. Just above the noise, 
however, the proprietor who was dressed in a dusty undertaker&#39;s outfit was 
regaling the crowd with tales of the horrors they&#39;d encounter within. About how 
just yesterday five people had mysteriously vanished in the third chamber known 
as &quot;The Sinister Laboratory Of The Nefarious Professor Ziffle.&quot; 

&quot;Should I scream in terror now, or wait until I see how much this&#39;ll cost me?&quot; 
commented Miranda drolly as they moved to near the front of the line.

&quot;Might as well get it out of your system now,&quot; replied Misty with a smirk as the 
proprietor ushered in a small group of people before closing and locking the 
flimsy wooden door behind them.

&quot;Oooh, two credits a person,&quot; the courier chuckled as she glanced at the sign 
and reached into her back pocket, &quot;That IS scary!&quot;

&quot;Oh. Looks like we&#39;re next,&quot; said Misty, as the man on the veranda stepped 
forward and started counting heads.

&quot;You five,&quot; he called out with a sinister toothy grin, &quot;You&#39;re next!&quot;

&quot;I just said that,&quot; muttered Misty with a chuckle as she followed Miranda up the 
wooden steps and stood near the door as the man collected money from the group.

&quot;Wraith beat both of you to it,&quot; added Miranda, handing off the credits and 
giving Misty&#39;s hand a reassuring squeeze, &quot;The day I caught him, he&#39;d changed 
all the screensavers on all the computers in a Sylph Co computer lab to say 
&#39;You&#39;re Next&#39;.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;d he mean by it?&quot;

&quot;Oh, nothing,&quot; the courier assured, &quot;He was just being silly and trying to scare 
people.&quot;

&quot;Did it work?&quot; inquired Misty with a smirk.

&quot;Well, maybe a little,&quot; Miranda admitted as the undertaker-garbed man unbolted 
the door and ushered them inside.

&quot;Now don&#39;t stray from the path,&quot; he warned, &quot;I can&#39;t be responsible for what 
happens if you do!&quot;

Miranda glanced at Misty and they both laughed as they walked into the first 
chamber. &quot;Dang,&quot; commented Misty as they followed the worn carpet through the 
room, &quot;It&#39;s not pitch black in here.&quot;

&quot;No, but it does have a certain charm,&quot; her lover teased as they wandered 
through what appeared to be a conglomeration of four rooms that had been rather 
abruptly joined and cordoned off a velvet rope. 

The first was a small living room containing a bookshelf and fireplace complete 
with papier-m?ch? fire. Before it was the dark shape of a plushy houndour who 
stood glaring at the passers by with glowing red eyes as its master, a skeleton 
in tacky looking tweed suit, sat in a large leather chair reading the paper and 
smoking a pipe.

&quot;Doesn&#39;t Joshua have one of those?&quot; inquired Misty, indicating the dark furred 
canine whose exposed bony ridges didn&#39;t look quite right.

&quot;Yeah, sorta,&quot; replied Miranda with a shudder, &quot;His name&#39;s &#39;Zule.&#39; But he&#39;s 
evolved since then apparently.&quot;

The second area was a kitchen, with a mannequin dressed to resemble a motherly 
looking woman in a flowered dress and an apron, merrily cleaving up her husband, 
a second mannequin who&#39;d been securely bound to the kitchen table, her 
animatronic arm working ceaselessly.

&quot;I&#39;ve seen her around Christmas time at the Celadon Department Store,&quot; chuckled 
Miranda, &quot;They have her cutting up fruitcake.&quot;

&quot;Fruitcake, you say? Now that IS scary,&quot; laughed Misty as they moved on.

The third small section held a canopy bed that was covered in cobwebs. Lying 
upon it was a second skeleton, although this one was wearing an ornate wedding 
dress, and her head turned as the group passed by.

&quot;Waiting for the perfect man, I guess,&quot; sighed Misty ruefully.

&quot;Or a bus on Sundays,&quot; pondered Miranda, &quot;One of the two.&quot;

They had to pass through fourth area to exit the first room. The area looked 
like a bathroom, complete with an enormous tub supported by clawed feet that was 
filled with a dark red substance, and toilet that had a large plushy raticate 
bursting threateningly from it.

&quot;You know,&quot; commented Miranda, glancing disapprovingly at the stuffed rodent, 
&quot;Even if something that large COULD crawl up through the pipes in your bathroom 
from the sewers, raticates can&#39;t hold their breath for that long.&quot;

&quot;Oh, and I think the tub&#39;s full of Kool-Aid,&quot; added Misty with a chuckle, &quot;I 
guess they ran out of red dye and baking soda.&quot;

&quot;This time of year?&quot; chuckled Miranda as they crossed the threshold into the 
second chamber, &quot;Definitely! Around here we sell out of fake blood by August!&quot;

The second room was done up like a lab. The velvet ropes guided the group along 
a winding path through what was obviously &quot;The Sinister Laboratory Of The 
Nefarious Professor Ziffle.&quot; Aside from the standard electrified Jacob&#39;s ladder, 
the wall of twisting glass tubing that emptied liquids of varying colours in to 
test tubes, beakers, and graduated cylinders, and the always popular dormant 
flesh-golem strapped securely to a slab, there was also a small section where 
failed experiments were &quot;imprisoned.&quot;

Each cell was made to resemble a small stone room, infested with plushy 
rattata&#39;s and other vermin, and all but one had a securely locked door made up 
of bars made from empty paper-towel rolls duct-taped together and painted black.

The first held a male mannequin wearing a black Armani suit and fedora with a 
pair of dark glasses manacled to wall. Upon closer examination, though, they 
could see that one of his hands was metal, and part of his face had been peeled 
away to reveal metal underneath as well. As they passed, sparks flew up from the 
left knee, and the pant leg fell away, revealing exposed circuitry.

The second, though, was slightly more in theme. Chained to the wall by spiked 
silver manacles was what appeared to be some kind of werewolf. The impressive 
piece of papier-m?ch? work had enormous hairless, bat-like ears, and network of 
spiraling scars across its chest. The beast&#39;s mouth was open to reveal its huge 
sharp teeth with a long forked tongue, and the dry ice placed upon each of its 
wrists beneath the manacles sent up white smoke to add credence to the 
prerecorded sound of pained howling.

The third room held a mannequin who sat upon his knees, staring down in horror 
at his hands. Enormous red lobster claws had replaced them and stuffed rodents 
around him seemed to be preparing a huge pot of boiling water with spices and a 
pound of butter.

The fourth and final room, however, had no bared door. It was open to laboratory 
in an attempt to make its contents seem more frightening. With its confines 
stood three figures. Two stood opposite one another, facing each other. They 
wore purple and gold robes and held blood red candles as the hidden speakers 
made it seem as though they were chanting some arcane ritual. &quot;Mangero Es 
Josephus... Mangero Es Josephus...&quot; they chanted as the third figure screamed, 
roared and ranted angrily.

It appeared to be an enormous, muscular gargoyle trapped within the confines of 
a complex looking mystic circle that he seemed unable to leave so long as the 
robed figures continued their chant.

&quot;I think I saw this movie,&quot; commented Misty as they moved on to the next 
chamber.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; added Miranda thoughtfully, &quot;But didn&#39;t it involve vampires in some 
way?&quot;

As they passed through the swinging wooden door, Misty suddenly gasped and 
quickly covered her mouth to hide her excitement. The room was so dark that it 
swallowed what little light passed through into it from the previous one as 
several others crossed the threshold. From somewhere in the darkness, hidden 
speakers emitted the sounds of a typical swampy bog. Above the sounds of 
crickets chirping, amphibians croaking, and occasional call of a nocturnal 
avian, came a quiet gurgling of stagnant water, coupled with the noise of oozing 
mud and of the wind blowing through long dead trees.

&quot;Quickly, this way,&quot; whispered Miranda, trying not to laugh as she lead Misty by 
the hand to about the middle of the room, the entire time feeling the touch of 
the strands of fabric someone had hung from the ceiling to scare those who 
passed through the room. However, once they had reached their destination, the 
two hopped over the rope that was there to both guide and keep people from doing 
exactly what they were doing.

&quot;Sounds like a relaxation tape for jynxes,&quot; commented Misty under her breath 
with a chuckle.

&quot;My hair&#39;s not that bad,&quot; chuckled Miranda, reaching out with her free hand and 
finding the far wall after a short walk. &quot;Ah, here we go,&quot; she whispered, almost 
to herself before sliding offer her glasses that would be of no use and turning 
to face Misty.

&quot;Hey,&quot; her lover giggled in reply, reaching out with nervously shaking fingers 
to touch Miranda&#39;s face and move the courier&#39;s hair back, &quot;you know I like this 
way.&quot;

Miranda smiled, and quickly placed a finger upon Misty&#39;s lips as the others 
who&#39;d followed them in entered the dark room with their own set of comments. As 
the group laughed and shrieked merrily at the soft touch of the simulated 
tendrils that hung from the ceiling, Miranda pressed her lips tightly against 
Misty&#39;s ear.

&quot;They&#39;re watching us, you know,&quot; she whispered as quietly as she could, each 
word barely audible even at that distance as she tried not to laugh, yet still 
sending shivers through her lover&#39;s body, &quot;They don&#39;t know it, but their eyes 
pass over us even now. They are not consciously aware of our presence, but on a 
instinctual level they know that we&#39;re here.&quot;

Misty&#39;s body shivered once again, and she dropped her hands to Miranda&#39;s 
shoulders, clutching them tightly as she pressed her lips against the courier&#39;s. 
All the while, she listened to the passage of the others, their heavy sounding 
footsteps across the wooden floorboards, and their laughing voices as they made 
noises to scare one another. 

&#39;She&#39;s right,&#39; Misty mused inwardly, tilting her head and trying to contain 
herself as she felt Miranda&#39;s hands brush aside her open Fall jacket and slide 
up her stomach, &#39;They can see us... They just don&#39;t know it! If we make just one 
sound they will, though. Goodness this is just too much!&#39;

As the group passed through the second door, and their voices became less 
echoing and more muffled, Misty pulled her lips away from Miranda&#39;s, only to 
have the courier kiss her teasingly as she stood panting for a moment.

&quot;Shh,&quot; cautioned Miranda, slowly reaching up to the top button of the silk 
blouse the trainer wore and with a controlled casualness set about undoing them 
one button at a time, &quot;They might still hear. And the next group is already on 
its way.&quot;

Misty nodded, casting around in the darkness as her pulse raced, wondering if 
her eyes would ever become accustomed to the blackness. Just then, a new set of 
voices heralded the coming of a second group, and Misty took a deep breath to 
stop herself from hyperventilating as she felt Miranda&#39;s hands upon her bare 
skin as the door was flung open.

&quot;Make no sound,&quot; Miranda cautioned, her voice quavering as her hot breath 
touched Misty&#39;s ear before running the tip of her tongue over it, following its 
curves and causing Misty&#39;s grip upon her shoulders to tighten.

&#39;But I could scream!&#39; Misty laughed inwardly, biting her lip and letting her 
head fall back and smiling happily as Miranda made slow, purposeful kisses down 
her neck, all the while the courier&#39;s fingertips played teasingly across Misty&#39;s 
bosom, separated only by the fabric of her bra.

&quot;Hey, what was that?&quot; she suddenly heard one of the travelers inquire, sending a 
sudden serge of white hot panic through Misty even as Miranda&#39;s fingers 
unclasped her bra and the air felt suddenly cool against her breasts.

&quot;It&#39;s just your imagination,&quot; laughed one of his companions as Miranda&#39;s fingers 
moved to encompass Misty&#39;s bosom, her strong fingers squeezing the hardened 
nipples she found.

&quot;You mean you&#39;re actually getting scared?&quot; laughed a third female voice, as the 
voice made an exclamation and stumbled forward, obviously pushed by his 
companion.

&quot;No, it&#39;s not that!&quot; the first argued as the sound of their footsteps came to a 
sudden halt, and the group stood silently, listening, &quot;I&#39;m sure there was 
something out there. It moved; I&#39;m sure I saw something move!&quot;

Misty squeezed her eyes closed, gritting her teeth and not daring to move or 
breath as she felt the familiar tingle of her womanhood. Even as all Miranda&#39;s 
hands did was gently caress the rise of her breasts, Misty could feel the 
suddenly warm dampness of panties pressed against her skin. The need to have 
Miranda&#39;s touch her making her body shake as though she were freezing, instead 
of sweating as the group finally moved on.

&quot;You okay?&quot; Miranda inquired, her voice both concerned and teasing.

&quot;Y-Yes,&quot; Misty hissed, quickly unbuttoning her jeans and grabbing one of 
Miranda&#39;s hands before forcing it down the front, &quot;N-Now please..!&quot;

&quot;Oh wow,&quot; giggled Miranda, biting her tongue to keep from laughing as her 
fingers touched the wetness she felt through her lover&#39;s comfortable cotton 
panties.

&quot;Shh,&quot; cautioned Misty, her voice sounding pleading, almost helpless, causing 
Miranda&#39;s heart to swell as her need to protect her beloved was sparked, 
&quot;Please, just touch me.&quot;

&quot;I just love you so much,&quot; was all that Miranda could mutter as she put an arm 
around Misty, kissing her passionately as her fingers slid beneath Misty&#39;s 
panties and touched the soft warm skin of her womanhood, causing Misty to jump a 
little as yet another group wandered in.

Misty closed her eyes once more, holding Miranda&#39;s wrist to keep her hand from 
moving as the group of five stopped all too quietly through the room. &#39;Oh my 
goodness!&#39; Misty thought as Miranda&#39;s middle finger pushed upwards with a 
careful back and forth motion, slowly rising as her labia parted obligingly and 
her body reacted with a sudden quiver, &#39;They- They know we&#39;re here! The last 
group told them that they heard something!&#39;

Misty then had to quickly lean forward and bite the shoulder of Miranda&#39;s 
courier jacket as her lover&#39;s other hand pushed at the back of her pants, moving 
them slowly down over the rise of Misty&#39;s bottom.

&#39;Oh!&#39; she exclaimed inwardly, her entire body quaking so badly that Misty 
worried that the entire room was shaking in response, that the group would feel 
it and alert someone as she felt cool air upon her suddenly exposed skin, &#39;Oh 
this is incredible!&#39;

Misty could feel tears in her eyes from the exertion as she used every ounce of 
her will not to react, not to simply scream out in her building ecstasy as 
Miranda&#39;s relentless hand pulled down her panties as well, whilst the courier&#39;s 
middle finger began to slowly, but rhythmically push in and out of her 
womanhood, almost in response to the slow, careful footsteps of their unwitting 
audience.

&quot;Want me to stop?&quot; came Miranda&#39;s barely audible voice, seemingly from far away 
as Misty finally noticed that the silent group had at last moved on.

&quot;G-! Goodness, no!&quot; whispered Misty, trying not to laugh as she felt her heart 
pounding in her chest, the swell of emotion that had nowhere to go driving her 
crazy, making it difficult to think straight.

Miranda smiled, thankful that Misty couldn&#39;t see her blushing, and wondering if 
it was safe to tell Misty just how much she was enjoying her lover&#39;s 
performance. &quot;Just tap me twice if I&#39;m going to far, okay?&quot; she whispered, 
giving Misty a chance to calm down as the next group through seemed to be taking 
their time.

Misty nodded in reply, panting as she leaned heavily against Miranda. &quot;Just 
promise me one thing,&quot; she said quietly, a smile that wouldn&#39;t leave crossing 
her lips.&quot;

&quot;Anything, my love,&quot; Miranda replied, holding Misty close with one arm, &quot;Just 
name it.&quot;

&quot;I- I want to come back here next year,&quot; Misty breathed with a laugh, trying to 
catch her breath as Miranda&#39;s thumb moved to caress her clit, &quot;I- I really enjoy 
this!&quot;

&quot;Shh, I know, dearest,&quot; Miranda whispered in amusement, her fingers running 
affectionately through Misty&#39;s soft, silky feeling hair, &quot;It makes me happy to 
do this for you.&quot;

&quot;Y-you don&#39;t mind, do you?&quot; Misty inquired, her voice sounding both worried and 
pleading.

&quot;No,&quot; responded Miranda, shaking her head and trying not to laugh, &quot;I&#39;ll admit 
I&#39;m a little nervous, but you know how much I like to watch you. How much I love 
seeing like this. How my heart feels as though it shall overflow with love to 
know that I can please you so.&quot;

Misty merely nodded, her head resting against Miranda&#39;s shoulder as the next 
group finally arrived and Miranda quickly became silent. &#39;Here we go again!&#39; 
Misty thought with nervous excitement as she felt Miranda&#39;s hand squeeze her 
bottom, before pushing her pants a little farther down, causing Misty to stand 
upon her toes, quivering as her expression contorted, trying desperately to 
remain quiet as she felt a pulse of ecstasy run through her. 

A moment later, she opened her eyes, desperately trying to take slow, shallow 
breaths as Misty stared out into the darkness, her ears alert to every sound the 
passers by made, desperately hoping that the swampy bog noises drowned out what 
little noise escaped her.

Then, as Miranda began to slowly side down, Misty reached out with her hands to 
steady herself, immediately finding the wall that Miranda&#39;s back had rested 
against. With both palms pressed firmly against it Misty looked down to where 
she knew her lover was, to where Misty could feel Miranda&#39;s hands moving to 
slide her pants the rest of they down to her ankles. 

It was all that Misty could do not to gasp as she sucked in her lips and bit 
against them to keep her mouth closed, to muffle what sound she made as her 
pants fell down around her ankles and left her standing half-naked, leaning 
against the wall with nearly half a dozen strangers looking in her direction, 
staring out at her exposed bottom through the darkness.

Miranda waited a moment, expecting Misty to stop her, but she felt no signal as 
she knelt upon her knees and touched the firm muscles of Misty&#39;s thighs 
appreciatively. &#39;Darkness itself cannot diminish the light of your beauty, my 
love,&#39; the courier thought as she moved closer, swallowing as she instinctively 
salivated, the scent of Misty&#39;s excitement seeming to hang heavily in their air 
around them.

&#39;Please hurry!&#39; Misty wanted to scream as Miranda&#39;s parted lips touched lightly 
against her stomach, &#39;They&#39;re leaving! There might not be another group for 
while!&#39;

As Miranda kissed Misty&#39;s stomach, her tongue teasing her lover&#39;s navel before 
sliding her hands over Misty&#39;s goose bumped skin and took a firm hold of Misty&#39;s 
bottom before moving to press her lips against Misty&#39;s womanhood, kissing them 
gently before sliding her tongue between Misty&#39;s labia as her finger had done 
before.

&#39;Wonderful!&#39; Misty exclaimed in her mind, shuffling her legs apart as much as 
she could and glancing over her shoulder to try to make out the dark shapes of 
those she knew she wouldn&#39;t see.

But, to Misty&#39;s surprise, someone was wearing a button on their coat. She 
recognized it as one of the glow in the dark gastly buttons one of the merchants 
was selling to tourists. Misty could just make out the words &quot;Lavender Halloween 
Festival&quot; written around the outer edge, with the laughing gastly in the center, 
its tongue hanging out to make it look silly instead of frightening.

Just then, the realization hit her. &#39;Oh my goodness!&#39; Misty thought, almost 
laughing in her combination of excitement and panic, &#39;He can see us! He&#39;s turned 
in our direction, and he&#39;s watching us!&#39;

For what seemed like forever, Misty stood awkwardly, leaning partially forward 
with her palms pressed firmly against the wall, biting her lip to remain silent 
as Miranda made her want to shout, as their observer stood motionless in the 
darkness.

&quot;Oh, sorry,&quot; murmured a voice, snapping Misty out of her sudden trace to find 
her body shaking with excitement as someone obviously walked into the observer 
and the two moved on.

&#39;The next g-group,&#39; thought Misty with a inward sigh, closing her eyes as a 
pleasant sense of vertigo began to overtake her, &#39;they ran into him.&#39;

Soon however, she found it difficult to stand, let alone keep quiet, as her legs 
seemed to want to buckle beneath her, and Miranda&#39;s tongue showed no signs of 
letting up. 

&#39;Move on!&#39; Misty silently willed the latest group of people who seemed to be 
making fun of the room, &#39;I can&#39;t- I can&#39;t keep this up much longer!&#39;

But still the group remained. Even as her heart pounding in her chest seemed far 
louder than any sound Misty was willing to make, and her whole body shook, 
demanding release, the small group of laughing festival goers continued their 
slow passage through the darkened chamber. 

&#39;Go! Leave!&#39; she pleaded in her mind, unable to find the will to ask Miranda to 
stop, even as her lovers hands caressed her while the courier&#39;s tongue traced 
teasing lines along Misty&#39;s labia, coming close, but never quite touching her 
clit, &#39;You can&#39;t be here when I-! When I-!&#39;

With every once of will she had, Misty forced herself to stand up straight, the 
sudden chill upon her womanhood, though, was nothing in compression to the 
sudden sense of betrayal her body sent her mind, almost bringing tears to 
Misty&#39;s eyes in her effort not to scream. Even as Miranda quickly covered her 
mouth with her hand to stifle her surprise, Misty shuffled closer to the wall, 
pressing her body against it as she shook compulsively against the sensation.

&quot;Are- Are you okay?&quot; came Miranda&#39;s whispered voice in her ear after a moment, 
and Misty found that not only had the group moved on, but that the courier&#39;s 
arms were around her, hugging Misty close as she took long, shallow breaths.

&quot;No,&quot; Misty chuckled quietly, turning to face Miranda and feeling a great sense 
of comfort as she embraced her, &quot;But I enjoyed myself.&quot;

Miranda&#39;s smile wasn&#39;t visible in the darkness, but Misty knew it was there. 
&quot;Good,&quot; the courier replied, nuzzling Misty&#39;s neck and gently kissing her ear, 
&quot;You had me worried there for a second.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; her lover admitted, listening carefully for the sounds of anyone else, 
&quot;I&#39;ll tell you this much. When I get you home tonight, you&#39;re finishing what you 
started.&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; Miranda assured teasingly, &quot;I&#39;ll have a darkroom with the entire 
population of Lavender waiting outside ready by then.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare!&quot; Misty giggled, carefully pushing Miranda back so she could 
reach down and pull her pants back up, &quot;But do you think we could sit-down for a 
while? I&#39;m exhausted!&quot;

Miranda nodded, listening to the quiet rustle of fabric as Misty shuffled to 
arrange her clothes properly. &quot;Okay,&quot; she said, glancing around as the swamp 
noises persisted, &quot;But we probably shouldn&#39;t stay too much longer. I&#39;m sure 
someone&#39;s noticed that we haven&#39;t come out the other side yet.&quot;

&quot;Eh, they can just claim that we were victims of that nefarious laboratory 
thing,&quot; said Misty, taking Miranda&#39;s arm as they both followed the wall to the 
floor and placed the courier&#39;s arm about her shoulders.

&quot;Or that raticate with the unlimited lung capacity in the first room,&quot; Miranda 
added with a chuckle. 

&quot;And then there&#39;s always the &#39;Endless Caverns&#39; over in the next room,&quot; offered a 
familiar voice, causing them both to jump with fright.

&quot;Zachary?!&quot; exclaimed Miranda, her tone both angered and relieved.

&quot;Hey, that&#39;s &#39;Zack&#39; to you, lady!&quot; her friend chuckled, trying to sound 
offended.

&quot;How long have you been here?!&quot; the courier demanded, reaching her hand out 
blindly and somehow catching hold of Zack&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Oh, about as long as she has,&quot; the psychic replied with a laugh as a second 
voice called out in the darkness.

&quot;Oh, hi!&quot; 

Miranda let go of Zack as a smile crossed her face. She half-recognized the 
speaker&#39;s accent from the Courier Club. &quot;Hey, looks like you took my advice 
after all,&quot; Miranda chuckled to Zack before turning her attention to the other 
courier, &quot;I hope he&#39;s not being too much of a pain. I&#39;m sure I could get my 
step-father to reassign you...&quot;

&quot;No way!&quot; she laughed in reply, &quot;Had I known it was so much fun up here on the 
main land, I would transferred ages ago!&quot;

&quot;I told her about you on the way over here,&quot; explained Zack with what must have 
been a grin, &quot;and then well, things kinda got a little out of hand...&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; said Miranda in a more serious tone as she turned back to Misty and 
whispered, &quot;It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s dark, they didn&#39;t see anything.&quot;

Misty&#39;s only response was a quiet nod as she sat staring out into the darkness, 
an embarrassed smile upon her face as she tried to decide exactly how she felt 
about the situation.

&quot;Well, actually,&quot; corrected Zack, ignoring the punch in the arm he received from 
Anna, &quot;I can see your auras. And wow! Misty&#39;s is REALLY pink right now! Are you 
embarrassed about something?&quot;

&quot;Zachary!&quot; Miranda exclaimed again, this time catching her friend&#39;s collar as he 
laughed and a harsh flash of brilliant light that blinded them instantly 
suddenly dispelled the darkness.

&quot;What the-?!&quot; came the suddenly confused sounding voice of one of the Chamber Of 
Lost Souls owners, followed by the sudden shuffling of feet and a few 
exclamations from the those who&#39;d been blinded.

&quot;Wow,&quot; commented a second, less surprised sounding voice, &quot;Now THAT&#39;S a new 
record!&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; agreed the first with a chortle, &quot;never had six of &#39;em before. Hey, 
maybe we should just open a place that&#39;s all just a big dark room and people pay 
to either &#39;hang out&#39; in it, and hire people to just walk through it.&quot;

&quot;Naw,&quot; said the second as Miranda rubbed her eyes and found her glasses, causing 
the blurry shape near the door to become two blurry shapes, &quot;We&#39;d get in trouble 
for that. But they&#39;d probably let us do it in Viridian. Ya can get away with 
anythin&#39; out there!&quot;

&quot;Six?&quot; Miranda inquired rhetorically, glancing around and finally making out two 
other figures that slowly came into focus as they straightened their clothes and 
rearranged their hair. 

&quot;Joshua?!&quot; she exclaimed in surprise, trying not to laugh as she saw the oldest 
courier and his wife Nancy standing across from her at the other side of the 
room.

&quot;Howdy,&quot; said Joshua, dawning his ten-gallon hat before tilting it in Miranda&#39;s 
direction as Nancy checked herself in a small hand mirror.

&quot;All right,&quot; the first of the two proprietors laughed, still wearing the dusty 
old undertaker&#39;s outfit, &quot;Off with ya. You&#39;ve all had your fun.&quot;

There was no argument from the group as they headed for the door and shuffled 
quietly though the Endless Caverns that seemed comprised of Styrofoam 
stalactites and stalagmites, with the occasional rubber spinarak attached to a 
web made of string, not to mention the plushy zubats hanging from the ceiling 
that seemed to have googly eyes; despite the fact that they were supposed to be 
sightless at that stage of their development.

&quot;See you at the fireworks!&quot; called Nancy with an amused smile as she and Joshua 
stepped quickly down the front porch steps and disappeared into the crowd once 
the group had gotten back outside.

&quot;I think they already did,&quot; chuckled Zack, quickly dodging Miranda&#39;s swat.

&quot;Well, that certainly makes this whole thing less embarrassing,&quot; Anna commented 
matter-of-factly.

&quot;Hey,&quot; said Zack with a shrug, &quot;I&#39;m not embarrassed.&quot;

&quot;Nothing embarrasses you,&quot; chided Miranda with a thin smile.

&quot;That&#39;s very true,&quot; he agreed with a nod, ignoring the fact that the southern 
courier seemed to be taking that as a challenge as Miranda turned her attention 
back to Misty.

&quot;You sure you&#39;re okay?&quot; she asked again, her stomach feeling weighed down by 
dread and her sense of guilt.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Misty laughed, resting her head on Miranda&#39;s shoulder, &quot;I&#39;m just 
starving!&quot;

&quot;Okay then,&quot; the courier said brightly, glancing at Zack and Anna, &quot;Hey, you 
guys hungry? It&#39;s on me.&quot;

Zack did a double take, a look of shock crossing his face as he tried not to 
laugh. &quot;When did you get rich?&quot; he inquired rather hastily.

Miranda shrugged. &quot;Long story,&quot; she replied, &quot;But apparently Bob thinks I should 
take more vacations.&quot;

&quot;I transferred over recently,&quot; commented the Orange Islander with a 
surreptitious glance at Zack, &quot;And I&#39;m really quite glad I did! Better scenery 
here...&quot;</pre>
