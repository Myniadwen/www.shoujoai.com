<h1>Lavender Ghost Story (part 19 of 23)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nikolai.html">Nikolai Mirovich</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/lavender-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>&quot;Retail Workers Should Always Be This Friendly...&quot;

The lights of the trading post were still burning bright, and the grinning Jack-
o-lanterns stared out at them eerily from the darkness between the festively 
decorated windows, a greeting to all travelers and nocturnal spendthrifts. As 
they trio ascended the wooden steps onto the porch, a hidden motion sensor 
reacted to their presence by switching on a recording of frightening sounds. 
Miranda recognized them as being from the Tower, and she smiled at the thought 
of how many tourists bought those same CD&#39;s every year.

The screen door swung outwards, and the main door beyond it pushed inwards, 
alerting the proprietor to their presence by the small rusting bell it knocked 
against when opened.

At the far end of the crowded looking store, a bored looking woman with large 
round glasses and long, curly brown hair glanced up at them and tilted her head 
to one side curiously. 

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s you,&quot; she said simply, turning back to the book she was reading, &quot;If 
you&#39;re looking for ghost-balls, Professor Laurna won&#39;t have them ready until 
tomorrow. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Miranda replied, &quot;I know. I&#39;m just here to reequip myself.&quot;

Sarah made no response as they entered her store, seeming content to let them 
wander about until they found what they were looking for.

&quot;But besides the usual Winter supplies, I do need a new bokken,&quot; added Miranda 
hastily.

Sarah looked up, meeting Miranda&#39;s eyes for the first time. &quot;Same as before?&quot; 
she asked dully, her tone sounding bored, almost unnatural.

&quot;Yes,&quot; said Miranda with a nod as Zack wandered down one of the food aisles, 
&quot;And maybe something for my friend here too?&quot;

Sarah turned her cold gaze upon Misty, sizing up the trainer as her dark blue 
eyes seemingly focused on something beyond the normal range of perception. &quot;Is 
she you&#39;re apprentice?&quot; the retail clerk inquired, squinting slightly as she 
wrote a few things down on a note pad.

&quot;Not exactly,&quot; Miranda admitted.

&quot;Whatever,&quot; said Sarah with a shrug before disappearing into the backroom.

&quot;One for me too?&quot; Misty inquired, glancing at her lover suspiciously, &quot;Ya think 
I&#39;ll need it?&quot;

Miranda shrugged and put her arms around Misty. &quot;It&#39;s more for my own peace of 
mind, I suppose,&quot; she admitted as her beloved looked into her eyes searchingly, 
&quot;I&#39;d just feel better knowing you&#39;re as safe as I can make you.&quot;

&quot;Miri,&quot; Misty whispered, a smile crossing her lips as she tried not to chuckle, 
&quot;Between you and Leviathan I feel pretty safe. I wouldn&#39;t worry so much.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to take it if you don&#39;t want to,&quot; Miranda assured, kissing Misty 
lightly upon the lips and ignoring the overly loud comments Zack made to himself 
about the price of canned soup.

&quot;No, I- I want to,&quot; Misty replied, her eyes betraying her thoughts and making 
Miranda smile, &quot;I want to be part of your world... From what I&#39;ve seen of it, 
it&#39;s so much better than mine ever was.&quot;

Miranda nodded slowly, hugging Misty closer and glancing behind the counter just 
as Sarah placed the two wooden swords down upon it. &quot;It&#39;s just a starter for 
now,&quot; she explained dully, sitting back down and going back to her book, &quot;But 
once you&#39;ve determined your style and preference, you can trade it in for one 
you like better.&quot;

Misty turned to her and smiled. &quot;Thank you, miss-&quot; she began out of habit, only 
to find Sarah ignoring her completely.

&quot;Come on,&quot; whispered Miranda, leading Misty away as she looked on 
sympathetically, wishing there was something she could do to help Sarah, &quot;Let&#39;s 
see if we can find some snowshoes in your size.&quot;

&quot;Is there nothing anyone can do for her?&quot; she inquired in a low whisper as 
Miranda lead her away, &quot;Can&#39;t the Guardian help?&quot;

Miranda shook her head. &quot;Her parents took her to Saffron the year it happened,&quot; 
she explained quietly as Zack ran past the aisle they were in, making bad 
gunfire noises and flailing the two model airplanes he was holding about 
dramatically as he went, &quot;The best psychics worked on her for nearly a year 
before giving up. Even the nanite treatments to restore her brain weren&#39;t 
enough. I guess the damage just goes deeper than our current technology can 
fix.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s too bad,&quot; Misty replied sadly, peering at Sarah through a gap between a 
pair of small portable stoves just as Zack bounded out of nowhere, causing her 
to nearly jump out of her skin, &quot;Zachary!&quot;

&quot;Hey! Sorry already!&quot; he whispered harshly, covering his ears as though Misty 
had just uttered a curse, &quot;There&#39;s no reason to call me names!&quot;

&quot;That is your name,&quot; chuckled Miranda, holding up a pair of jeans lined with a 
warm, cold resistant material.

&quot;Whatever,&quot; muttered Zack, standing on his toes and glancing over the top of the 
shelf full of Winter boots at Sarah, &quot;She&#39;s pretty though, isn&#39;t she?&quot;

&quot;Um, I guess so...&quot; Misty admitted, suddenly blushing and turning away from the 
proprietor.

Zack smiled sadly. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, &#39;bout it,&quot; he assured her, &quot;at least you didn&#39;t 
ask her to go to the Halloween dance at the Festival last year.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s a dance at the festival?&quot;

&quot;I thought I could help her out,&quot; he explained, &quot;Take her out, show her a good 
time. Maybe spark some kind of an emotional response. But nothing. She used to 
be quite a hyperactive kid, but now her aura&#39;s just plain ole&#39; dark blue all the 
time. Oh well.&quot;

&quot;But what about-?&quot;

&quot;If you&#39;re looking for a girlfriend, there&#39;s that new courier from down South in 
town,&quot; offered Miranda, adding a new thermos to her list of purchases and 
glancing at Misty with a suddenly teasing smile, &quot;I think she&#39;d be more your 
type.&quot;

&quot;Guys?&quot; inquired Misty, looking from one courier to the other as Miranda tried 
to keep a straight face, &quot;When&#39;s this Halloween dance thing? We didn&#39;t miss it 
already, did we?&quot;

&quot;I suppose,&quot; Zack replied glumly, staring at the cobwebs on the still ceiling 
fan above his head, &quot;Most of the other couriers in town this year ARE taken, so 
I guess I&#39;d stand at least a bit of a chance.&quot;

Misty turned to Miranda, trying not to smile as she grabbed the lapels of the 
courier&#39;s jacket. &quot;Listen you!&quot; said Misty, trying to sound angry, but chuckling 
at Miranda&#39;s falsely innocent expression, &quot;What&#39;s this about a dance at the 
Halloween Festival? Are you holding out on me?&quot;

&quot;So anyway, Zack-&quot; Miranda began, her arms full of purchases and unable to 
defend herself as Misty backed her up against the closest wall as Zack laughed.

&quot;Sorry, lady!&quot; he called back, &quot;Can&#39;t help you! Company policy!&quot;

Miranda looked down into Misty&#39;s eyes as she felt the wall against her back, and 
shivered slightly at the look in her lover&#39;s eyes. &quot;Can I help you?&quot; she said 
coyly, managing to keep her voice level as her pulse raced. 

&quot;Mm, hmm,&quot; Misty responded, nodding as she leaned over the bundle of supplies 
Miranda was clutching to her chest and kissing her lightly, &quot;I think you know 
what I want.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Miranda gasped in mock amazement, &quot;Right here? Right now?!&quot;

&quot;Miri!&quot; Misty laughed, unable to contain herself.

&quot;Alright, alright,&quot; the courier chuckled, setting down her bundle on an nearly 
empty bottom shelf, &quot;Tomorrow&#39;s the thirty-first, which means all the big stuff 
happens. Pretty much everyone takes the day off, and just has fun. There&#39;s 
always this big parade that starts out right around here, and goes through most 
of town before ending at the festival grounds. And there&#39;s all this free food, 
and people telling stories about how they caught their ghosts, and all the usual 
stuff...&quot;

&quot;And?&quot; inquired Misty, her impatience having to make room for amusement as her 
fingers pushed aside the Miranda&#39;s jacket and traced paths across the courier&#39;s 
sides, making her jump.

&quot;And after they have this best costume contest thingy for the kids, they play 
music &#39;till dawn and let the adults have a good time,&quot; she explained, twisting 
and contorting herself to make it difficult for Misty to tickle her, even as 
Miranda found herself talking through gritted teeth, &quot;It&#39;s kind of an open air 
Halloween party. Wanna go?&quot;

&quot;Yes. I would,&quot; said Misty slowly, her tone teasing as she held her face close 
to Miranda&#39;s and continued to run her fingers along her lover&#39;s sides, wondering 
how long Miranda could keep from laughing, &quot;Very much so...&quot;

&quot;Ah! Okay!&quot; Miranda exclaimed, laughing both from being tickled and from 
amusement, finally having to grab Misty&#39;s wrists and hold them over her head, 
&quot;Just-! Just-!&quot;

&quot;Just?&quot; Misty inquired, her tone sounding a little sultry as she brushed her 
lips gently, almost inperceptively across Miranda&#39;s.

The courier glanced around nervously and noticed Zack turning away, trying not 
to laugh. &quot;You did this on purpose, didn&#39;t you?&quot; she asked in a whispered tone.

Misty smiled, kissing Miranda playfully on the nose. &quot;You started it,&quot; she 
teased, &quot;But yes, I like making you loose control from time to time. It&#39;s 
amusing.&quot;

&quot;Amusing?&quot;

&quot;Well, maybe a little more than that,&quot; she admitted with a laugh, trying not 
blush as Miranda gave her an all too knowing look.

&quot;Is there something I should know?&quot; the courier inquired, bringing their arms 
back down and sliding her own about Misty&#39;s waist.

Misty&#39;s blush deepened and she glanced away, smiling uncontrollably. &quot;It&#39;s- It&#39;s 
just that, well, you know,&quot; she stammered, trying to find the right words and 
wishing that they were alone.

&quot;I think I might,&quot; Miranda assured her, brushing Misty&#39;s hair out of her eyes 
and kissing her gently, &quot;Look, I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m not as emotional as some people. 
I think I just get it from my mom, you know...&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s not that,&quot; Misty relied, her hands now holding Miranda&#39;s face 
adoringly, &quot;It&#39;s just that sometimes it&#39;s like you&#39;re afraid of breaking me or 
something. You&#39;re always so gentle, and kind. And I appreciate that, but you 
shouldn&#39;t be afraid to just come right out and say things some times.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; said Miranda with a sigh, &quot;But I guess that I just... Well, it&#39;s 
silly, but I don&#39;t want to feel like I&#39;m taking advantage of you.&quot;

&quot;Ha! As if!&quot; laughed Misty, taking a step back and finding Miranda&#39;s hands, 
&quot;Miri, you&#39;ve opened my eyes to so many new possibilities that I&#39;ve never even 
dared to dream of. You&#39;ve turned my life around, and you&#39;ve shown me more love 
than anyone ever has in my entire life. And in the end, you&#39;ve asked for nothing 
in return. No, I&#39;m the one taking advantage of you. Not the other way around.&quot;

Miranda smiled, casting half a glance in Zack&#39;s direction and noticing that he&#39;d 
vanished once again. &quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; she said, her gaze returning to the seeming 
vastness of her lover&#39;s eyes, &quot;and don&#39;t worry. I know when someone&#39;s taking 
advantage of me. I&#39;ve been there, and that&#39;s something you&#39;re definitely not 
doing. So, is there anything else you think we should pick up?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got quite a pile of stuff already,&quot; Misty replied, glancing back at the 
assortment of Winter gear Miranda had grabbed off the shelves, &quot;but I trust your 
judgment. So, um, how much do I owe you for-?&quot;

&quot;Please stop that,&quot; Miranda interrupted, her tone so serious that Misty was 
taken back.

&quot;But, I-&quot; Misty began, the sudden anxiety she felt making her stomach clench.

The courier&#39;s smile returned, and the sudden hard look in her stormy gray eyes 
softened. &quot;Look, I kinda had a problem with Wraith while you were at the Gym 
this afternoon,&quot; she explained as Misty relaxed a little, &quot;I had to chase him 
out of Bob&#39;s computer, and well, it gave me a chance to take a look at my 
account.&quot;

&quot;Okay...&quot; said Misty pensively, sensing what was to come, but not wanting to 
overreact.

&quot;Err, yeah,&quot; Miranda replied, standing on her toes to see over the top shelf to 
where Zack was now bothering Sarah, &quot;And, well, Bob suggested that I take a 
vacation.&quot;

&quot;A vacation?&quot; 

&quot;Or something,&quot; the courier explained, &quot;It seems that I&#39;ve been a little bit of 
a workaholic. I haven&#39;t taken a real vacation since I started, and I&#39;ve 
stockpiled quite a few more credits than I&#39;d anticipated.&quot;

&quot;Even with the &#39;extra expenses&#39;?&quot; Misty inquired, glancing guiltily at 
splendidly warm looking Winter coats Miranda had chosen for them.

&quot;The extra furniture I got you for when we&#39;re in Cerulean set me back a bit,&quot; 
Miranda replied with a shrug before slipping out of Misty&#39;s arms and quickly 
picking up their purchases, &quot;but it only really dented my account. So, I&#39;m 
thinking, maybe... If you don&#39;t mind that is... Of staying in town for a while. 
Maybe until New Years?&quot; 

Misty smiled, shaking her head as she sighed in amusement. &quot;Did you mention that 
part to your mom yet?&quot; she inquired, following Miranda to the counter where Zack 
was trying to impress Sarah by levitating a handful of jellybeans and causing 
them to dance in the air.

&quot;Not yet,&quot; Miranda admitted, blushing a little at Misty&#39;s expression.

&quot;You know she&#39;ll be ecstatic.&quot;

&quot;Hey, I&#39;d pay to see that,&quot; laughed Miranda, dropping the bundle on the counter 
and breaking Zack&#39;s concentration.

&quot;To see what?&quot; inquired Zack as jellybeans scattered everywhere.

&quot;To see you sit still for five minutes,&quot; the courier teased as Sarah rapidly 
keyed the purchases into the computer without looking, seeming unperturbed by 
the mess Zack had made.

&quot;Hey, Sparkles takes care of the calm side of this operation,&quot; he explained with 
a grin as a flash of light appeared from nowhere just over his shoulder a second 
before a loudly snoring abra teleported onto it.

&quot;To speak the name is to evoke the power,&quot; Miranda muttered, smiling at the 
psychic vole as she scratched the pokemon between her sharply pointed furry 
ears.

&quot;Good point,&quot; commented Zack before concentrating as hard as he could and 
muttering, &quot;Pizza, pizza, pizza...&quot;

&quot;Give it up!&quot; Miranda laughed, handing Sarah her card, &quot;So, how are you doing?&quot; 
she inquired of the clerk.

Sarah paused for a half a second before responding. &quot;My stomach is a bit upset 
and my right foot has gone to sleep,&quot; Sarah responded, her brow furrowed as she 
carefully considered the question before running Miranda&#39;s card through the 
computer, &quot;And I&#39;m concerned by the fact that the Trading Post will be closed 
tomorrow. I am uncertain as to how I shall spend my time.&quot;

&quot;Ah, honesty!&quot; laughed Zack as Sarah packed up Miranda&#39;s things, &quot;Ain&#39;t it 
great!&quot;

&quot;Well, you could always go down and see the fireworks tomorrow night,&quot; Miranda 
offered, &quot;Or help out with the parade.&quot;

Sarah shrugged. &quot;Perhaps I will offer to assist the clean-up crew afterwards,&quot; 
she replied in the same dull tone, &quot;Although I must speak with your mother 
concerning the fact that she insists on paying me for tomorrow. It is wrong to 
pay someone for working a day that they did not work. Is it not?&quot;

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Miranda with a shrug, finding Sarah&#39;s peculiar attitude as 
disheartening as ever, &quot;Well, thanks for your time. Have fun tomorrow!&quot;

Sarah stared back at her for a moment, her dully blue eyes devoid of any emotion 
beyond puzzlement. &quot;I will endeavor to find a method to fill the time,&quot; she 
promised, glancing at the other two, &quot;Is there anything else either of you 
needed?&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot; replied Zack with a wide grin.

&quot;No, no it&#39;s alright,&quot; Misty responded with a sad smile, trying not to feel too 
unnerved by Sarah&#39;s dispassionate gaze and thankful for the sudden warmth of 
Miranda&#39;s fingers through her own, &quot;We- we&#39;ll just be leaving now. Thanks.&quot;

But Sarah had already returned to her book, with Miranda&#39;s credit card sitting 
on the counter waiting for her to retrieve it. &quot;Come on,&quot; the courier said 
quietly, &quot;Let&#39;s drop this stuff off and head back to the festival.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll race you there,&quot; offered Zack, glancing over his should back at Sarah as 
Misty opened the door.

&quot;We have our bikes, you know,&quot; Miranda replied with a sly smile, &quot;You sure?&quot;

&quot;Absotively!&quot; the psychic laughed as they walked back out into the cool night 
air and he snatched Sparkles from his shoulder, &quot;See you there!&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; laughed Miranda as the two vanished with a sudden loud -POP!-, &quot;That&#39;s 
cheating.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s Zack,&quot; Misty agreed with a chuckle, &quot;I guess he just needed to get 
away.&quot;

&quot;From Sarah you mean?&quot;

Misty nodded a little guiltily. &quot;Yeah, but it&#39;s not nice to say, though.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s okay,&quot; assured Miranda as they walked hand and hand back towards the 
house, &quot;it&#39;s true. Zack&#39;s made it his mission in life to make Sarah smile again, 
and think his failures are starting to get to him. I really do think he should 
think about finding someone, though. Even just to take his mind off Sarah.&quot;

&quot;You know,&quot; commented Misty after they&#39;d dropped off their things and started 
back towards the distant echoes of the festival, &quot;I still think that there&#39;s a 
lot more to Lavender Town than I suspected. I really should have paid more 
attention to it last time I was through here.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s okay,&quot; said Miranda with a smile, &quot;I much rather prefer being your tour 
guide. I grew up here, and it&#39;s all &#39;normal&#39; and boring to me, but with you, 
it&#39;s something unique and different. I guess it just gives me an opportunity to 
see this place through new eyes. Maybe that&#39;s why it&#39;s not as depressing here 
now.&quot;

&quot;I guess then we&#39;re even now, eh?&quot; 

Miranda smiled. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; she mused as a few non-scheduled fireworks went up 
over the harbor, &quot;but if not, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll think of some other way for me to 
make up the difference.&quot;

&quot;Just promise me forever,&quot; Misty chuckled, remembering something Vivian had 
said.

&quot;Actually, I was hoping for something a little more long term.&quot;

&quot;Eternity?&quot; Misty offered.

&quot;For all time?&quot;

&quot;Until all of Creation grinds to a halt?&quot;

&quot;Naw, longer than that.&quot;

&quot;Um, how about the time it takes to find the last decimal of pi?!&quot; Misty laughed 
exasperatedly.

&quot;It&#39;s a nine,&quot; said Miranda, trying to sound serious as they stopped at the main 
intersection and Misty turned to face her, &quot;But I think that&#39;ll do. Maybe.&quot;

&quot;How about you love me until I ask you to stop?&quot; Misty offered at last, their 
arms wrapping around one another, &quot;Think that&#39;ll do?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; assured Miranda, her quiet tone becoming slightly more serious, &quot;Because 
that&#39;s the only thing that will end my love you for. Your wish for it to end.&quot;

&quot;That day will never come, Miri,&quot; whispered her beloved as their lips met, &quot;Not 
now, not ever...&quot;</pre>
