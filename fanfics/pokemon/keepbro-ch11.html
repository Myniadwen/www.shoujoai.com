<h1>Keep Thy Brother Safe (part 11 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/keepbro-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>It was 3:30 at the youth hostel. Misty got a voice mail on the mobile. 
It was Tai in a very angry manner. 

Hey ginger, it&#39;s Tai, Kari&#39;s brother.&nbsp;I just want you to know what I 
really think of you. You are a bicth! You hurt TK fucking bad you stole 
my sister and stole my niece .HOW DARE YOU SHAG MY SISTER IN FRONT OF 
NIECE After everything she&#39;s been through if you dare hurt my sister, in 
any way, and I mean any way, cheat on her, hit her, make her cry, fall 
out with her, or insult her at all in any bloody way what so ever then 
I&#39;M GONNA RAPE YOU SO HARD, YOU&#39;LL BE PERMANENTLY DISABLED FOR THE REST 
OF YOUR SHITTY LIFE, and if you dare call your self a parent off Rosie I 
will personally kill you&nbsp;

Kari could hear Tai&#39;s verbal and physical abusive voice mail she was 
upset. 

&quot;I&#39;m useless good for nothing bicth&quot; Kari muttered coldly 

&quot;No you&#39;re not,&quot; Misty begged 

&quot;Why not?&quot; Kari cried 

&quot; Coz I love you &quot; Misty replied, &quot;I don&#39;t want you to get hurt&quot; 

&quot;Misty, I...&quot; Kari looked down, she was also afraid, &quot;I love you too. 
Knowing my brother, he hates you big time, Tai can&#39;t accept the fact I&#39;m 
a lesbian. I know this whole thing is screwed up and it&#39;s not your fault 
or mine. It&#39;s just screwed up, that&#39;s all I know, but I know I truly 
love you. And I&#39;ll protect you,&quot; Kari said this whole thing in one 
breath which surprised Misty because she was still trying to catch her 
breath after running so fast. 

Misty got up as Kari walked closer to her. The two were feeling awkward 
about this, but it felt nice. Butterflies were both fluttering in their 
stomachs, both of them thinking about what the other said, carefully. 

Kari was a bit surprised when Misty wrapped her arms around her neck. 
She soon followed by wrapping her arms around her thin waist. The two 
were moving closer to one another, but Kari quickly engulfed Misty&#39;s 
lips in a kiss. 

Misty shivered at the pleasure she felt as Kari tightened her grip on 
her. Kari softly pressed harder on her lips as Misty untied her 
ponytail. Feeling the ginger hair made her feel a strange relief. She 
felt Kari&#39;s finger getting tangled in her own hair that also made her 
shiver slightly. 

Kari enjoyed the way Misty taste. She tasted kind of like a sweet black 
berry and she enjoyed it a lot. She softly asked Misty for entrance as 
she complied. Feeling so nice and feeling kind of fuzzy at once. She 
soon dominated over Misty&#39;s mouth as Misty let her fingers grace the 
back of her neck causing goose bumps to rise. 

Kari pulled away, panting for air as for Misty. The two seemed a bit 
embarrassed, but also very happy. Misty smiled as she gave Kari a little 
kiss on her lips. Kari then kissed her ear causing Misty to giggle. The 
two seemed to be happy as they embraced each other. 

Kari rested her head on top of Misty&#39;s while Misty rested hers on her 
shoulder. 

Meanwhile Ash and May where getting ready, 

&quot;How do you think your mom&#39;s going to react?&quot; May asked 

&quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; Ash replied &quot;but the last thing I need is lecture&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m very scared about it is well&quot; May whispered &quot;ya know it would&#39;ve 
been ok if we where in Jetiendo, we could get away with murder.&quot; 

&quot; Well, &quot; Ash replied hugging May &quot; I do want her to know that you&#39;re 
pregnant... but we have no easy way of saying it&quot;&nbsp;

&quot;One thing&#39;s for sure&quot; May started &quot;we better tell our mates before Ant 
and Dec do&quot; 

&quot; Do you know how many weeks pregnant you are?&quot; Ash asked. 

&quot; I don&#39;t have a bloody clue&quot; May reply. 

&quot;The words are stuck in my throat,&quot; Ash whispered. &quot;We&#39;ve gotta meet 
Misty in half an hour we better go.&quot; 

&quot;Ok&quot; May reply. They both left the bedroom holding hands non-the wiser. 
As they left the department closing the door behind them 

When the four met, they walked around the shops, 

&quot;The landlady Belldandy&#39;s really nice&quot; Misty replied &quot; she&#39;s looking 
after Rosette now&quot; 

&quot;So&quot; Ash started &quot; you&#39;re going back to cerulean Misty?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah&quot; Misty replied, &quot; I can&#39;t live here anymore&quot;&nbsp;

&quot;Kari&quot; May called to Kari &quot; I need help on something&quot; 

&quot;Help on what?&quot; Kari asked. 

&quot;Well, I gotta start by telling you.... I&#39;m pregnant&quot; 

&quot; Your pregnant?&quot;&nbsp;Kari asked May surprisingly. 

&quot; Yeah&quot; May muttered 

&quot;That&#39;s great&quot; Kari replied &quot;for how long?&quot; 

&quot; I don&#39;t know?&quot; May replied 

&quot;What do ya mean ya don&#39;t know?&quot; Kari asked 

&quot; Strong libidos&quot; May replied 

&quot;What did ya want help from me for?&quot; Kari asked 

&quot;Well,&quot; May stuttered, &quot;should we still be having sex whilst pregnant?&quot; 

&quot;Does he use condoms?&quot; Kari asked seriously raising an eyebrow at her. 

&quot;No &quot; May replied 

&quot;Oh&quot; Kari replied, &quot;That is very unprotected sex,&quot; 

Misty&#39;s face turned down, she had never felt so low in her life, all 
these threats on her mobile phone was driving her insane, ignoring the 
happy three besides her. Another reason she was in the depths of despair 
was that phone call about her family, her sisters where in a car crash 
and she lied to her family that she would be there as fast as she can 
and she&#39;s still in Japan all for the love of Kari whom given up 
everything to be with her and brought her kid with her. Misty has a 
deeper problem, but let&#39;s not spoil the surprise until later. To keep up 
morale Misty kept her head up, rapped her arm around Kari.&nbsp;Then the four 
noticed Brock outside the shop harassing Miyu Yamano. 

&quot;There he is again&quot; Misty reacted &quot;hasn&#39;t changed a bit&quot; 

&quot; He&#39;s flirting with Miyu Yamano&quot; Kari shouted out. 

&quot; I gotta see this&quot; Ash smirked holding May&#39;s hand. This made Misty 
shiver just seeing them in love. 

It was absolute torture watching him and May get married, now there was 
more torture to come May was having Ash&#39;s kid, after all did she deserve 
it? She tried to kill him, she lost her baby, and now she&#39;s bisexual she 
has been bullied even more. Misty&#39;s been bullied because of the way she 
dresses, her ginger hair, being a lesbian, and being foreign all silly 
reasons to insult someone yet an easy target.&nbsp;

Then Misty&#39;s phone rang no doubt its horrid call by someone when she 
rang it while Ash and May went over to see Brock. Misty answered it; 
Matt was on the phone. 

YOU&#39;RE GOING DOWN WATERFLOWER, YA GOING DOWN 

Misty hung up; nearly breaking down she ran away, Kari followed her. 

In the toilet cubicle Misty was crying all night. Silently as possible, 
Kari hearing her cry and feeling her tears made her feel like crying. 

&quot;Misty, &quot; Kari whispered, &quot;what&#39;s wrong please don&#39;t get upset it hurts 
me too, &quot; 

Misty made a painful look at her then Kari realised the reason why &quot;you 
still love him?&quot; she asked bitterly knowing the answer. Misty nodded. 
&quot;What do you think of May?&quot; Kari asked 

&quot;She is...pretty.&quot; Misty whimpered&nbsp;&quot;Maybe that&#39;s why he noticed her, 
despite the fact that I travelled with him for two years? &quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re quite pretty is well&#39;&quot; Kari comforted Misty stroking her hair. 

&quot;She&#39;s skinnier.&quot; Misty cried, &quot;I bet she doesn&#39;t eat half as much as I 
do...&quot; 

&quot;Hey&quot; Kari smiled &quot;in a few months time, she&#39;ll be as fat as anything&quot; 
Kari attempted to cheer her up. It failed. 

&quot;She&#39;s younger...probably by a year or two&quot; 

&quot;Age doesn&#39;t matter&quot; 

...Yet she looks so much more mature then me... 

&quot; She has sex about 5 hours a day&quot; Kari replied &quot;that seems immature to 
me&quot; 

&quot;She has bigger breasts. Mine are only growing...not nearly as big as 
hers...&quot; 

&quot;I love your tits&quot; Kari exclaimed, &quot;anyway that is inappropriate to 
judge a girl on.&quot;&nbsp;

&quot;Her hair is brown where mine is red,&quot; 

&quot; Hair colour doesn&#39;t matter&quot; Kari hissed drying the flowing tears on 
Misty&#39;s face. 

&quot; And stylish while mine is...boring...&quot; Misty continued as if Kari 
wasn&#39;t there. 

&quot;The pain of realization is horrible isn&#39;t it?&quot; Kari whispered. Misty 
nodded in agreement&nbsp;

&quot;Only after I had gone&quot; Misty replied still full of angst&nbsp;&quot;did I realize 
that I still had feelings for Ash when we split up...but it was too 
late. When all this time he had feelings for me. I was so blind...I 
didn&#39;t see the signs at all until it was too late. I wonder if Ash is 
going to remember all the good times...with me, that is. I know I 
treated him badly sometimes, but...I was na&#139;ve. He and Brock were my 
only friends in the world...I mean, who would want to be friends with a 
runt like me, when they could be seen with my &quot;sensational&quot; sisters? I 
hope that he finds happiness with May. She doesn&#39;t seem too bad. Maybe 
she&#39;s right for him...after all; they&#39;re the same age, while I&#39;m two 
years older then him. She&#39;s much better then me, and I bet she treats 
him better then I ever did&quot; 

&quot;Please&quot; Kari begged hugging Misty, &quot;get over him, you have me now, dry 
those tears you don&#39;t want those two to see you cry&quot;
