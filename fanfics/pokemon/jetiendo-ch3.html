<a href="../pokemon/jetiendo-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>The bells rung the church style in both dormitories 

&quot; Everybody up guys &quot; Roared the voice of Grinal you could hear it in 
both dormitories &quot; get washed dressed and line up at the slaps&quot; 

&quot; Hi every one &quot; Kari squealed as she and May burst their way in to the 
boys dormitory 

&quot;This is the boys room&quot; Max snapped at May 

&quot; You have no sense of humour &quot; Tai replied &quot; welcome to the boys 
dormitory Kari. And you are?&quot; 

&quot; May &quot; May replied 

&quot; What are you doing Gary?&quot; Tai screamed 

&quot; He&#39;s flirting with the princess&quot; Matt replied 

&quot; We are now part of a fairy tale,&quot; Kari announced 

&quot; I&#39;m make my own fairy tale&quot; Davis said as he was making a move on Kari 

&quot; Hey!&quot; T.K shouted out to keep Davis away from Kari &quot; Gary went out the 
window&quot; 

All of them scurried to the window to look at the Love at the garden 

&quot; Fairies&quot; Kari shouted out &quot; look at them &quot; I gotta take a picture take 
a picture of this&quot; 

&quot; Look Ash,&quot; May whispered &quot; don&#39;t it look so romantic&quot; 

&quot; Eh yeah&quot; Ash replied. 

Meanwhile in the garden itself Tasha and Gary still obviously falling 
for each over 

&quot; There talking about us&quot; Gary whispered 

&quot; Let them think what they want&quot; Tasha replied 

&quot;Come on&quot; Davis roared out the window &quot; are you coming Gary?&quot; 

&quot; No &quot; Gary shouted back see you later 

&quot; Yeah&quot; Davis replied &quot; see you later&quot; 

Half an hour later Gary and Tasha had left the monastary. 

&quot; Shyst&quot; Tasha roared, &quot; It&#39;s me its Tasha. I got a new friend I want 
you too meet&quot; 

They were at a huge field filled with flowers top to bottom with a large 
clean road in between a huge windmill was there is well. A girl in a 
pink Victorian style dress with Victorian accessories with purple hair 
and wore glasses came walking by with Nana and Polo rushing to Tasha as 
if they where on a race to get their first and Shyst was lagging far 
behind. 

&quot; Hey!&quot; roared a voice &quot; It&#39;s me its Garnet 

As if someone had cheated a boy walked towards Tasha. Gary noticed some 
similarities between Garnet and Ash. 

The huge clash between the four ended up with them all falling over on 
Tasha&#39;s feet. They all shot up. Nana and Polo where still humming their 
interlude. 

Love is in the air 

Love is in the air 

&quot; The wind is calm&quot; Garnet announced, &quot; The flowers are happy. The birds 
fly with pride. Us humans must keep the peace.&quot; 

&quot; Nice speech&quot; Gary lied, not knowing anything else to say. 

&quot; Gary&quot; Tasha smiled &quot; these are my friends Nana, Polo, Shyst and my 
cousin Garnet&quot; 

&quot; My sister and I &quot; Polo started are known famously as the ice climbers&#39;
