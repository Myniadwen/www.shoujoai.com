<h1>Jetiendo (part 1 of 38)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<pre>At about sunset in Japan a group of kids followed six men to a train 
station 

&quot;Come on guys,&quot; roared Mr Grinal &quot; the train will be leaving any 
momement&quot; 

The kids followed him as they all zoomed to Jetiendo express where they 
sat in any seat &quot;right every one we&#39;re all silent&quot; the five-second delay 
then it was the silence.&quot; have your seatbelts on at all times. Also Dr 
Spoona....&quot; 

The students bursted out laughing &quot; ok year 9 quiet please&quot; Mr Grinal &quot; 
WE DO NOT BULLY TEACHERS, is all of that understood&quot; 

&quot;Yes Mr Grinal&quot; said the students in the train. Mr Grinal sat down in 
his seat as Mr Sirou, Mr O Grady Dr Spoona, Mr Cowell and Mr Paykei sat 
next to Mr Grinal.Then the train started to move it was zooming away! 

&quot; And it&#39;s fifth grade not year nine Grinal&quot; muttered Davis. 

At the back of the train five students named Davis, Yolei, T.K and Kari 
where standing up doing expressions that where silly of Mr Grinal. 
However Cody sat reading Shakespeare, 

&quot;GRINAL&quot; shouted Davis 

&quot; Grizzly&quot; roared Yolei 

&quot;DOUBLE THE TROUBLE WITH GRINAL&quot; T.K boomed 

&quot; EVERY ONE ON THE SLABS GUYS &quot;boomed Kari as she was impersonating Mr 
Grinal. 

&quot;Please don&#39;t impersonate my voice Karen&quot; replied Mr Grinal 

The Davis bursted out laughing and in cannon every one started doing it 
as soon as Mr Grinal stood up there was silence though out the room 

&quot;Oh!&quot; Davis announced &quot; By the way Grinal it&#39;s Kari not Karen&quot; 

&quot; Spoona spooned his mom in wholegrain Grinal&quot; roared T.K. 

All that the students could do is laugh. Mr Grinal however did not find 
it a joke as he marched to the back of the train and stared at Davis 

&quot; Ok Davis come with me ya sitting at the front&quot; Mr Grinal snapped. 

&quot; That wasn&#39;t me,&quot; roared Davis &quot; you idiot&quot; 

&quot; Do not talk to me in that rude fashion&quot; said Mr Grinal. Davis had no 
choice but to move right to the front alone as Mr Grinal followed him to 
make sure it was exactly what he was doing. 

For the past few seconds Davis had sat alone. His face still full of 
laughter then four kids where looking for some seats as everywhere else 
was full. Davis recognised one of them straight away his cousin Ash. 

&quot; ASH! &quot; shouted Davis 

They turned around the boy with a Pikachu on his shoulder recognised him 
too 

&quot; Davis &quot; roared Ash back &quot; come on you guys,&quot; Ash said to Brock, May 
and Max &quot; let&#39;s sit next to my cousin&quot; they all sat comftably 

&quot; So &quot; Davis mouthed, &quot;how&#39;s the Hoenn region?&quot; 

&quot; Brilliant&quot; Ash replied, &quot; How&#39;s Veemon?&quot; 

&quot; Fine&quot; Davis replied 

&quot; Davis &quot; Ash said, &quot; this is May, this is Max and this is... &quot; 

&quot; The mighty Brock&quot; Brock said proudly. 

&quot; Oh&quot; replied Davis in a bored manner. 

&quot; So&quot; Ash started &quot;where&#39;s ya friends?&quot; 

&quot; They&#39;re at the back&quot; answered Davis &quot; We are on a school trip and we 
have the most miserable teacher in the world, who sent me to the front 
of this train.&quot; 

&quot; What&#39;s his name?&quot; asked May. 

&quot; Mr Grinal &quot; whispered Davis pointing at him &quot; we also have a teacher 
called Dr Spoona!&quot; 

Ash, May, Max and Brock roared with laughter. 

&quot; Dr Spoona &quot; Max giggled &quot;what a stupid name.&quot; Then Dr Spoona stood 
there patiently staring at them, as they took no notice of them. 

&quot; Spoona Balloona&quot; screamed May then as Pikachu turned around Dr Spoona 
was still there Pikachu nudged Ash&#39;s shoulder and made them all look at 
Dr Spoona. 

&quot; I don&#39;t like it when people make fun of my name&quot; groaned Spoona. &quot; I 
had enough of that in England, I will have to make detentions for them&quot; 

&quot; Am I bothered? &quot; replied May. 

Spoona gave up he walked away to prevent further shame. 

&quot; Good one May&quot; muttered Ash. 

&quot; Thanks&quot; replied May. 

&quot;Hey&quot; Davis whispered &quot; Mr Grinal left his register on the floor &quot; 

&quot; What where you thinking of doing then Davis?&quot; asked Brock. 

&quot; Well&quot; Davis answered, &quot; I was thinking of adding you four into our 
school trip&quot; 

&quot; Great idea&quot; gasped May. 

&quot; Pen. Pen. Pen.&quot; Davis whispered. &quot; Ah, Quality. Mr Grinal dropped his 
pen too.&quot; 

Davis in a split second picked up the pen and collected the register 
then started writing. &quot; Ash how do ya spell ya Ketchum? &quot; 

&quot; Its spelt K E T C H U M Ketchum &quot; 

&quot; Thanks Ash, &quot; Davis Replied. &quot;Brock what&#39;s ya surname?&quot; 

&quot; Slate&quot; Brock replied 

&quot; Thanks&quot; Davis replied, &quot; May what&#39;s your surname?&quot; 

&quot; Our surname is Day &quot; Max replied as if he had no trust in his older 
sister May. 

&quot; Your brother and sister? &quot; gasped Davis 

&quot; Unfortunately yes&quot; replied May. Davis completed adding the names on 
the register. Davis threw the pen harshly at about 90 miles an hour 
spinning viciously above the seats; Then Davis smoothed the tiny creases 
on the paper then let it fly all the way on the floor. 

&quot;WHO THREW THIS FUCKING PEN AT ME?&quot; roared Mr Paykei with sheer anger 

&quot; GRRRINNNNNNNALLLLLLLLLLLLL!&quot; boomed T.K in his loudest voice that 
Davis and his cousin could hear. 

&quot;PAAAAAAKIIIIIIIII!&quot; Kari screamed. 

&quot; IT&#39;S PRONOUNCED PAY-KEY,&quot; roared Mr Paykei 

&quot; WHOLEGRAIN&quot; Yolei roared 

&quot;SPOONA SPOONED HIS MOTHER!&quot; Cody echoed as if he was in a football 
pitch. Mr Grinal marched straight to the back of the train. 

&quot; Right T.K and Kari&quot; Grinal started &quot; this isn&#39;t working. I have to 
separate you two. Kari you go to the front of the train next to Davis.&quot; 

&quot; Ha-ha&quot; giggled Yolei at Kari. 

&quot; And you Yvonne&quot; Grinal reacted 

&quot; It&#39;s Yolei by the way Grinal&quot; T.K replied 

&quot; See me at the end T.K please &quot; reacted Grinal 

Yolei and Kari where followed by Mr Grinal to the front of the train. 
Grinal noticed his register on the floor then went back to Davis 

&quot; Davis, why have you moved?&quot; Grinal asked. 

&quot;I&#39;ve been sitting here all this time,&quot; Davis snapped. As the other four 
roared with laughter. &quot;What a bastard&quot; Davis whispered. 

&quot; Davis move&quot; demanded Grinal &quot; AND SIT NEXT TO KAREN AND YVONNE. See me 
at the end&quot; 

&quot; Can&#39;t even say their names correctly,&quot; Davis muttered as he sat next 
to Yolei and Kari. Grinal walked away 

&quot; Silly man&quot; Davis reacted. T.K dashed out of his seat and jumped to 
Kari. 

&quot; I&#39;m bored&quot; T.K excuse was &quot; so I&#39;m sitting here&quot; 

&quot; I&#39;ll sit next to my cousin&quot; Davis said as he returned to his old seat. 
Then Mr Paykei then started talking 

&quot; Shut every one and listen to me.&quot; Mr Paykei &quot;I am calling out the 
register. So please shut up or I cant fucking hear you. 

Let&#39;s start with Izzy&quot; &quot; Yes sir&quot; &quot; Sora&quot; &quot; Yes sir&quot; &quot; Matt&quot; &quot; Yes sir&quot; 
&quot; Tai&quot; &quot; Yes miss. I mean sir&quot; 

&quot; Tai see me at the end please&quot; Mr Grinal replied as the train was 
filled with laughter As soon as Grinal stood up the train was silent 

&quot; Let&#39;s carry on&quot; Mr Paykei said &quot; Joe&quot; &quot; Yes sir&quot; &quot;Mimi&quot; &quot; Yes sir &quot; &quot; 
Ken&quot; &quot; Yes sir&quot; &quot; Gary &quot; &quot; Yes sir&quot; &quot; Kotono&quot; &quot; Yes sir&quot; &quot;Rei&quot; &quot; Yes 
sir&quot; &quot; Himeno&quot; &quot; Yes sir&quot; &quot; Mawata&quot; &quot; Yes sir&quot; 

&quot; Davis&quot; &quot; Yes sir&quot; &quot; Yolei&quot; &quot; Yes sir&quot; &quot; Cody&quot; &quot;Yes sir&quot; &quot;T.K&quot; &quot;Yes 
sir&quot; &quot; Kari&quot; &quot; Yes sir&quot; 

This register was very long Mr Paykei took about two minutes until he 
went to the names Davis added. 

&quot; Ash&quot; &quot; Yes sir&quot; &quot; Brooke&quot; &quot; Uhhh yes sir &quot; May&quot; &quot; Yes sir&quot; &quot; And 
finally Max&quot; &quot; Yes sir&quot; 

As soon as Mr Paykei finished the noise restarted. 

&quot; Let&#39;s sing&quot; Tai screamed &quot; Christmas carols&quot; the students sang to the 
top of their voices. Or you could say shouted to their heart&#39;s content. 

We wish you a merry Christmas 

We wish you a merry Christmas 

We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new 

&quot; Stop every one please&quot; Mr Cowell demanded, &quot; I don&#39;t mean to be rude 
but that was the worst carol singing I have ever heard in my life. The 
carols where terrible you shouted instead of singing. I know you can do 
better. A lot better 

&quot;Ok guy&#39;s&quot; Mr Grinal boomed, &quot; We have twenty minutes till we are at 
Jetiendo. The conductor coming to check your tickets so you have 30 
seconds to find your tickets.&quot; 

Matt and Tai began to sing or you could say shout as if there where 
doing karaoke 

Oh star of wonder star of night 

Shine of royal beauty light 

Westward leading still proceeding 

Guide us thy perfect 

&quot; Matt,&quot; Mr Grinal groaned see me at the end please &quot; with your brother&quot; 

&quot; WHAT ABOUT ME! &quot; Tai shouted out. 

&quot; You&#39;re already seeing me at the end with your sister as well&quot; Grinal 
whispered pointing at Tai. The students where laughing their heads off &quot; 
it&#39;s not a laughing matter&quot; Grinal moaned again 

&quot; Ticket&#39;s please,&quot; shouted the conductor in a very strong Welsh accent 

&quot; Now that&#39;s a welsh voice&quot; Davis said to Ash and his friends in a welsh 
accent 

&quot; Isn&#39;t it great&quot; Ash replied in a very bad welsh 

&quot; That welsh accent was appalling&quot; replied May &quot; out of ten two&quot; 

&quot; Great Mr Cowell accent by the way May&quot; Ash replied in his normal 
accent.
