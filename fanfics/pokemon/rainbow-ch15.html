&quot;So you did then?&quot; came Misty&#39;s voice, quiet in the darkness, the warmth 
of her body snuggled against her beneath the thick blankets reassuring 
in comparison to the sense of dread uncertainty that the question filled 
Miranda with.

&quot;Yes,&quot; the courier replied quietly, a hint of guilt audible in her voice 
as she held her lover a little closer, her stomach tightening into a 
knot, wishing they didn&#39;t have to discuss it, but knowing full well that 
it was better that way, &quot;But it was way before I met you...&quot;

An amused giggle banished the looming sense of doom Miranda felt as 
Misty leaned back, lifting her upper torso off of the courier&#39;s chest, 
her lover grinning mischievously. &quot;So, was she any good?&quot; Misty inquired 
teasingly.

Miranda smiled knowingly as she felt her heart begin to beat again and 
slid her hand across the soft smoothness of Misty&#39;s cheek, holding her 
lover&#39;s face fondly as she spoke. &quot;Sex without love pleasures only body, 
and merely sooths the mind,&quot; the courier replied in her most sagely 
tone, &quot;But when true love enters into the equation, it feeds the soul.&quot;

The silliness of Misty&#39;s grin faded into a small, longing smile as she 
leaned into Miranda&#39;s hand, the tinge of jealously she had sought to 
banish with humour, subsumed by her love for the courier. &quot;Miri...&quot; she 
managed softly, moving slowly back down to the comforting warmth of 
Miranda&#39;s naked skin, &quot;I just love you so much...&quot;
