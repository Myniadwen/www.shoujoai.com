<pre>Author&#39;s Notes: It&#39;s imiumi and it&#39;s smutty fluff. Nothing more needs 
to be said.

------------------------------------------------------------

I don&#39;t believe that I ran out of the house. I don&#39;t believe that 
Satoshi had the nerve to tell me what he did. I don&#39;t believe that I&#39;m 
crying over the boy who trashed my bike all those years ago. I don&#39;t 
believe... Well, obviously there&#39;s a lot that I just don&#39;t believe.

I wipe the tears from my eyes, sitting down beside the pond out behind 
the Ookido ranch, thankful for the quiet, and thankful for the 
solitude. I&#39;ve probably gone and ruined Satoshi&#39;s birthday but I 
really don&#39;t care...

He shouldn&#39;t have led me on.

Well, did he really lead you on?

Yes, he did! He said he loved me... that was supposed to mean 
something.

But what if it did? While it lasted, that is.

Well, if it meant something, then he wouldn&#39;t have suddenly realised 
that he was gay. So shut up, you stupid voice in the back of my head!

Silence.

Sighing, I pick up a stone and throw it out onto the water, watching 
the ripples as it skips and then sinks into the liquid. I can&#39;t 
believe I&#39;m acting so pathetic. I&#39;m over-reacting and it&#39;s over 
*Satoshi* of all people. Not that he&#39;s not a great friend...

He just... sort of... decided he was gay. After we&#39;d been dating for 
six months.

You know, no big deal.

... was it something that I did?

&quot;Ugh!&#39; I stood, throwing my arms out wide. &quot;Men! I hate them!&quot;

A light voice behind me rang out as it laughed, &quot;They&#39;re not all bad, 
I&#39;m sure,&quot; the voice quieted, and I recognised it immediately. I span 
around, and Imite stood there smiling, two cherry Popsicles in hand.

&quot;Eh... Imite...&quot; I stammer, and she smiles, walking up to me and 
offering me one of the glistening Popsicles.

&quot;Need to talk?&quot; she asks, and I nod as I accept the Popsicles from 
her. She sits down first, her long legs peeking out of her short 
shorts. &quot;What exactly happened?&quot; I sit down beside her as she 
questions me.

&quot;Well...&quot; I take a lick of the cherry dessert. &quot;It&#39;s a long story.&quot;

&quot;I like long stories,&quot; Imite replies with a grin. &quot;Plus I&#39;m your 
friend and... well, Satoshi was worried that you ran off...&quot;

I feel anger bubbling up. &quot;Why didn&#39;t he come to check on me, then?&quot;

&quot;Because,&quot; Imite&#39;s laugh rings crystal clear. &quot;He was sure that you&#39;d 
end up bashing in his skull with a mallet. It was safer for me to come 
talk to you. Got it?&quot; her tongue flicks out and takes a lip of her 
Popsicles tip.

I&#39;m transfixed for a moment, and then I shake my head to clear the 
daze. &quot;Uh... I... I didn&#39;t mess up his party, did I?&quot;

Imite shakes her head sincerely. &quot;No. Satoshi&#39;s trying his best to 
keep up a smile. He didn&#39;t want to hurt you, Kasumi.&quot;

&quot;I -- I...&quot;

She sets her hands on my leg, and takes a lick of her Popsicle. 
&quot;You&#39;re still his friend and he loves you for that. But sometimes... 
what we thought was love isn&#39;t really love. It&#39;s something else... 
well, it doesn&#39;t make you want to stay forever with someone.&quot;

I sigh and then take a bite off the tip. &quot;He has cruddy timing 
thought. I mean, honestly... out anniversary is next week!&quot;

Imite&#39;s hand remains there on my leg, a warm comfort. &quot;And he wasn&#39;t 
breaking up with you on purpose because of that. He... it&#39;s like...&quot; 
she closes her eyes for a moment, and when she opens them, they&#39;re 
bright and shining. &quot;It&#39;s like you get forced into living a lie, and 
then... well, then you&#39;re scared to break out of that shell. And 
then... well...&quot; she closes her eyes again, and takes her hand away.

I note the fact that I miss the contact, intimately...

&quot;Imite, I...&quot;

Imite opens her eyes again, and grins. &quot;I&#39;m not supposed to be 
bringing you down.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not. I&#39;m just... thinking...&quot;

&quot;Your Popsicle is melting,&quot; she says, absently taking another bite of 
her own. I look at my hand, noticing the sticky red rivulets that have 
begun to thread down towards my elbow. I start to laugh, and laugh, 
and then the treat slips free, falling onto the grass.

I peer down at it, and then look at Imite, wide-eyed. We start 
laughing again, as one.

It feels good... to not focus on what was weighing me down. And it&#39;s 
not like it was a long time ago. But this... I like this. Not having 
to worry. The laughter&#39;s making me feel *good*. And I want to keep 
feeling this way...

&quot;Here, take this,&quot; Imite says, and she hands me her Popsicle. I accept 
it, blinking, and then she takes my hand, and pulls it towards 
herself. &quot;Imite, what...&quot;

She grins wickedly, and then leans her head close and starts to lick 
the cherry juice off of my arm. I... oh my...

I don&#39;t even think I think that this is weird. I mean, it&#39;s Imite. 
She&#39;s very good at making it known what she wants. And when she wants 
something, she can be forceful... Right now, I think she wants me.

I... I... &quot;Imite,&quot; I gasp, feeling my eyes as they begin to slip 
closed. The touch of her tongue is sending bolts of pleasure down my 
spine, and it would be so easy to give in. So nice to just let go... 
to feel cherished and loved and... &quot;Oh God...&quot; I groan, and she starts 
sucking the juice off of my fingers now, one by one.

&quot;Imite,&quot; I whimper, and she pauses, still holding my hand, finger 
still within the warm wetness of her mouth.

&quot;Mmhmm?&quot; she replies, swirling her tongue round the tip.

I could melt right here... &quot;M-melting...&quot; I whisper, and she grins 
broadly. She lets go of my hand, and then reclaims the one that&#39;s 
holding her Popsicle -- cherry goo running down my fingers...

&quot;It&#39;s just not your day,&quot; she whispers, claiming the Popsicle and 
sucking on it thoughtfully.

&quot;Imite, I...&quot;

She let&#39;s it out of her mouth with a gentle &#39;pop&#39;, and offers it to 
me. It glistens in the sunlight, and I fight the temptation until it&#39;s 
overwhelming. Leaning towards her, I bow my head and take the melting 
Popsicle into my mouth.

I hear Imite&#39;s groan as I take the mush in, swallowing it and then 
continuing to suck on the pop. &quot;Kasumi,&quot; she moans my name, and I pull 
back, licking the stick where it&#39;s been revealed, pink and soaked with 
the juice of the Popsicle.

I&#39;m driving her crazy and I like what I&#39;m doing...

She drops the stick suddenly, and I look up. Her eyes are practically 
glowing with a sudden urge, and she reaches out, her hands cupping my 
cheeks. &quot;Kasumi,&quot; she says, her voice a hushed whisper. Her fingers 
are sticky against my skin, and she leans closer, cold lips hovering a 
breath above my own.

I can feel myself trembling... I might not be sure of anything else, 
but I&#39;m sure of this. I know I am... I push against her, the taste of 
her lips soaking against my own. I slide my hands up her back, 
clutching the light fabric of her tank top, our tongues warring for 
supremacy.

Satoshi never kissed me like this... he never made me feel alive... he 
never made me want more. Maybe he wasn&#39;t even trying. Maybe... maybe 
he wasn&#39;t the one who I was supposed to give my all to...

&quot;Imite,&quot; I gasp, breaking away from her lips. Her hands slide down my 
throat, chill to the touch and making me shiver, tremble, beg for 
more. &quot;I-I... I... kiss me again?&quot; I finish with clarity, and she does 
so obligingly. I could do this again and again and it wouldn&#39;t ever 
get tiring...

She breaks off the kiss this time, and caresses the back of my cheek 
gently. &quot;Kasumi, I --&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; I say with conviction.

She grins slightly. &quot;You didn&#39;t even give me time to ask...&quot;

I lean towards her, and touch her lips with mine, licking her bottom 
lip and making her whimper.

Her gaze is glazed over as she lets go, leaning back. &quot;I... are you 
sure? I don&#39;t want to force you...&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;m not being forced,&quot; I reply, and then push her backwards. She 
hits the grass, looking up at me with wide eyes.

&quot;Oh Kasumi,&quot; Imite whispers, and a grin crosses her lips. &quot;You&#39;re 
asking for it, you know...&quot; she whispers, and then she rolls and pins 
me beneath her. Laughing, her hands tickling my sides, I struggle, and 
send us rolling again...

Right down into the water.

Imite laughs and splashes away from me, sitting up and whipping wet 
hair around her face. I pull myself to a sitting position, soaked to 
the bone and not caring at all. We stare, and then she laughs.

&quot;Kasumi... I...&quot; she gestures for me to come closer, and I wade out 
towards her. She slips her arms around me, hands sliding up under my 
wet shirt. &quot;I love you, you know,&quot; Imite says in a small voice, and I 
can feel her rubbing against me.

I lose myself in the feel of her against me, hands wandering lower. 
Her tongue keeps me distracted, and then she turns me and pulls me up 
against her. My eyes go wide as I feel soft kisses being rained on my 
neck, and her hands sliding down my front.

She tugs at my shirt, freeing the bottom in the front and letting a 
hand guide it&#39;s way back up my wet front, caressing a breast which 
sends tingles on pleasure down through me. I moan, thrashing against 
her, but she holds me close.

Caressing me, touching me... one hand moving down, down below... she 
deftly undoes my shorts and then her hand slides in. I shift, widening 
my legs to accommodate her, moaning as she sucks on my throat. &quot;Love 
you... want to feel you...&quot; she murmurs, sliding her fingers into the 
folds between my leg. &quot;Oh God...&quot;

The pleasure that builds as she caresses my labia builds and builds 
and builds, until I just want to break... and she&#39;s not let up on my 
chest, either. Or my throat... or... or... it&#39;s sensory overload. 
&quot;Oh... Imite... G-god... I...&quot; I tremble, the feelings are almost too 
much.

But I wouldn&#39;t ask her to stop...

I close my eyes, whimpering and moaning as it builds up and then I 
just can&#39;t resist it anymore. I feel the release, the sudden relief, 
but she doesn&#39;t let me go. She keeps hold of me, biting down on my 
throat. Gently, not viciously, not breaking the skin... She rubs me 
harder and harder, slipping her fingers deeper, pushing me over the 
edge again.

In the end, I lean back against her, panting and breathing heavily. 
&quot;You okay?&quot; she asks, kissing my neck tenderly.

&quot;Good. Very good...&quot;

Imite laughs, and hugs me tightly. &quot;I love you, Kasumi. I love you so 
much... I&#39;m so glad I had this chance to let you know.&quot;

I close my eyes. Maybe I could love her too. Try, at least... I&#39;d like 
to try... Something hits me, suddenly. &quot;You don&#39;t think anyone saw us, 
do you?&quot;

Imite kisses me again, tingles creeping up my spine. &quot;No. I told them 
I wanted privacy.&quot;

&quot;Oooh...&quot; I close my eyes, snuggling against her. &quot;Imite?&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; she murmurs, lips otherwise occupied.

&quot;Could we do that again?&quot;

I feel the shape of her grin against my skin. &quot;Well, now that you 
mentioned it...&quot;
