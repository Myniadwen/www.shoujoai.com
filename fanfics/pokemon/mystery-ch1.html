<h1>The Mystery Fic</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a>

	Ten years.

	I can hardly believe that much time has passed. It feels like 
it was only yesterday when we first admitted our true feelings for 
one another.

	Our relationship was a rocky one for the first few years. 
Our relationship before we fell in love, that is.

	My job caused more than a little bit of friction between us 
and at times I think she may have even hated me because of it. 
Because of what it made me do.

	But it&#39;s not like she was a perfect angel either.

	There are more than a few occasions in which I can recall 
her tricking me to get what she wanted or just to help her friends.

	Help her friends... no. Help him.

	I always thought that they would end up together. Even 
when they would argue I could see how much they loved each 
other.

	So how did she end up with me? I really don&#39;t know. By 
chance or by divine luck I suppose.

	Divine luck for me.

	My life was so lonely before she came. Oh sure, I had my 
friends. I had him.

	He was my fellow mischief maker, my stalwart companion, 
my loving friend, and my constant support.

	He was all this and more until I lost him.

	The accident was a stupid one. I can admit that now. It 
was stupid and it never should have happened.

	When I look back on it I can see it was perhaps one of 
our lamest schemes. Something we should&#39;ve never even thought 
of hatching. Something best left alone.

	But we were never ones for leaving anything alone. Even 
now I&#39;m not really sure what drove us on. Was it the need for 
praise or just a driving ambition we had inside?

	I&#39;m not sure, but I do know it caused his death.

	Their deaths.

	They both died in the accident. Her love and mine. At the 
time it happened they were just beginning to realize how deep their 
feelings ran for one another.

	Then he was taken from her. He was taken from her and 
somehow she was given to me.

	I still don&#39;t understand how it happened.

	Maybe it started with me quitting my job and joining her 
on the road. The two of us traveled alone for months, just 
wandering throughout the countryside.

	We were going nowhere really.

	The journey was more about healing than anything else. It 
was a journey of the heart and not of the body.

	I think it was then that we fell in love. Or at least then that I 
fell in love. She was so gentle with me.

	Outwardly, to a stranger she could appear abrasive and 
perhaps even obnoxious but outwardly, to a stranger I appear 
snobbish and selfish in nature.

	Neither of these characterizations could be remotely true. 
They&#39;re merely our surface selves. What we let others think us to 
be because we fear them knowing our true inward selves.

	Even when we were enemies of sorts I realized we were 
the same in this way. The same in our need to hide in order to 
protect our hearts from being wounded.

	It was raining when we first kissed.

	We had taken shelter in a cave and I was arranging our 
things and trying not to smile as I listened to her long litany of 
curses caused from her attempts at starting a fire.

	All the same, she noticed my smile and demanded that I 
try to start a fire and see if I still found it amusing.

	And when I had a fire started two minutes later the smile I 
wore was wider and definitely triumphant.

	&quot;Show off,&quot; she accused me on seeing it.

	Lifting my head, I looked up at her and our faces were 
only inches away. The flames from the fire cast dark shadows on 
her face that served to accent her beauty.

	Our eyes locked and I remember feeling like I was 
drowning as I looked into those emerald depths. When our lips 
met it was mutual, it was our unconscious decision.

	Decision? No, it wasn&#39;t even that.

	It was our instinct. Yes, that fits better. We didn&#39;t know 
why we did what we did. Only that we had to. That we were 
drawn to do so by some unseen force.

	Perhaps it was destiny. Who knows? I&#39;m just glad that it 
happened because without it I don&#39;t know where I&#39;d be.

	Ten years have passed since that night.

	And fifteen years have passed since we first met. Since I 
first said my infamous introductory words to her.

	&quot;Prepare for trouble...&quot;

-End-


The characters of Jessie and Misty in this fanfiction are from the 
series Pokemon. Okay, yes I&#39;m sick. But at least it wasn&#39;t a lemon 
and just to note I aged them several years so Misty is in her middle 
twenties in the fic. Anyway, this little fic was brought about by a 
challenge from a friend (Richard Gallivan, who asked me to name 
him) of mine. He dared me to try and write a f/f romance fic for 
Pokemon and make it believable. I don&#39;t know if I really 
succeeded with the latter but hey, at least I tried.
