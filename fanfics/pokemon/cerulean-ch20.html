<h1>Cerulean Dreams (part 20 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nikolai.html">Nikolai Mirovich</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/cerulean-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>The day was sunny and cloudless as Summer once more fought back 
against the onset of Autumn, but the cool breezes off the lake as 
well as the shade from the ancient maple trees that filled the 
park kept Misty and Miranda from baking in the sun as they enjoyed 
their lunch on the last day of the Cerulean City End Of Summer 
Festival. 

&quot;There he is,&quot; Miranda commented chewing her french-fry quickly 
before waving her arm in a wide arc as Officer Frank came up dirt 
path, dodging small children on his way to meet them.

Misty glanced over her shoulder and smiled as Nezumi glanced up 
from the small bowl which contained the remainder of Irene&#39;s 
pokechow that he was sharing with Ivy and squeaked a loud greeting 
to the growlithe that followed on Frank&#39;s heels. 

At the sound of her name, Bow let out a loud bark and Nezumi 
grinned broadly, once again causing Miranda to sigh warily, 
shaking her head at the two pokemon who seemed to enjoy teasing 
each other far too much. 

&quot;Hey, guys!&quot; called Frank as walked over to the picnic table and 
gave the strange slumbering creature on the bench beside Misty a 
curious look, &quot;Um, this yours?&quot;

Misty glanced down at the dozing Kappa; the psyduck had had a hard 
morning. Umi had been trying to teach him to swim again, and he&#39;d 
almost managed to master floating. 

&quot;I&#39;m afraid so,&quot; his trainer muttered with a half a smile, 
scratching the defective water creature on the tummy as Frank 
rounded the table and sat beside his almost-niece, &quot;He&#39;s not much 
to look at, but he kinda grows on ya after a while.&quot;

&#39;Yeah, like a fungus!&#39; Nezumi to surreptitiously to Ivy in 
pokespeak, causing Miranda bounce a fry off his head.

&quot;So, I take it you two&#39;ll be heading out soon,&quot; commented Frank, 
grinning mischievously as he grabbed Miranda&#39;s drink and took a 
sip without asking.

&quot;Not until you do,&quot; he niece replied with a knowing smile and a 
hint of severity.

&quot;What?&quot; inquired Frank helplessly, &quot;You don&#39;t trust me?&quot;

&quot;Have you even CALLED Aunt Laurna yet?&quot;

The Pokeforce Officer nodded. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he admitted in a strangely 
shy tone, glancing down and pretending to be fascinated as Bow 
begged desperately to be helped up into his lap, &quot;That&#39;s how I 
know you two are headed for Saffron.&quot;

&quot;After a not so short trip to Neon Town, though,&quot; Miranda agreed 
with a sigh, stretching out her legs and half wondering how long 
the snow would hold off that Winter, &quot;I got stuck doing some mail 
delivery not too long ago, so now I&#39;ve been asked to deliver a 
bundle up that way. But, we&#39;ll be in Lavender in time for 
Halloween. I expect to see you there, you know.&quot;

Frank avoided his niece&#39;s all too knowing look by turning to 
Misty. &quot;Well, the reason I mentioned that,&quot; he segued with a 
complete disregard for tact, causing Miranda to give him a bit of 
a dirty look, &quot;Is that I hear that Saffron&#39;s Gym Leader&#39;s got a 
haunter. So maybe she could teach Miranda a thing or two about 
them, make Wraith a little more manageable.&quot;

&quot;I seem to vaguely recall that...&quot; said Misty thoughtfully as 
Miranda slid her index finger under her uncle&#39;s unshaven chin and 
turned his head towards her. 

&quot;If,&quot; she said imperiously, &quot;I want advice on haunters I&#39;ll just 
ask the world&#39;s premier authority on spectral-parazoology. Say 
like... Oh, I don&#39;t know... Maybe... AUNT LAURNA!&quot;

&quot;Ah, Miri,&quot; mused Frank, finally helping Bow up onto his lap, 
&quot;Sometimes you remind me so much of your mother.&quot;

Miranda gave him a sour look and tried not to laugh as Misty and 
Nezumi chuckled at her. &quot;Don&#39;t try and change the subject, you!&quot;

&quot;Yes, Viv&#39;,&quot; he said, his toothy grin still present, his gray eyes 
still laughing merrily.

&quot;Oh you!&quot; Miranda exclaimed in an exasperated tone, finally giving 
up and dropping the subject, &quot;Alright fine. So, how did Chef 
Troy&#39;s trial go?&quot;

Frank coughed into his hand, catching Misty&#39;s slight grimace out 
of the corner of his eye. &quot;Oh, it went well,&quot; he said with a 
nonchalant shrug, &quot;Joy broke down into tears when she found out 
she ate curried chansey, but that didn&#39;t exactly hurt our case. 
Jen&#39;s a bit ticked, but Irene made her a few new outfits and sent 
over a huge box of baked stuff, so it&#39;s all good.&quot;

&quot;Never underestimate the power of Mom,&quot; Miranda commented 
ruefully.

&quot;I guess we&#39;ll be seeing yours in a month or so then?&quot; Misty 
commented with a slight edge to her tone, causing Miranda&#39;s heart 
to feel heavy in her chest.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she agreed without much enthusiasm, &quot;And you&#39;ll get to 
meet Bob face to face, which means a decent meal for once.&quot;

&quot;Hey, Vivian can cook,&quot; defended Frank before hastily adding, &quot;I 
think...&quot;

&quot;Better than me,&quot; Miranda sighed, suddenly thinking about the 
fortnight&#39;s worth of instant ramen in her backpack.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; assured Misty, her smile a bit sad as she thought 
of her own parents, &quot;I&#39;m sure that between us we can survive &#39;till 
then. I did spend a few years traveling with an uncertified chef 
you know.&quot;

Miranda smiled. &quot;I know we won&#39;t starve,&quot; she said, her tone 
becoming amused as she glanced down at Nezumi, &quot;If we did we&#39;d 
never hear the end of it!&quot;

&quot;Uuuuummmmiiii!&quot; replied the rattata, suddenly standing on his 
haunches and doing his best gastly impression as though to 
threaten to haunt his trainer from beyond the grave if he starved 
to death.

&quot;Point taken,&quot; Misty commented, handing Nezumi one of the french-
fries she really didn&#39;t feel like eating.

&quot;Okay then,&quot; replied Frank, checking his watch, &quot;I&#39;m back on duty 
in five minutes, and I still have to make transfer arrangements, 
so I&#39;d better go.&quot;

&quot;So you DID call, Aunt Laurna then?&quot; inferred Miranda as the 
officer set Bow on the ground before getting up himself.

&quot;Bye, Miri! See you later!&quot; he laughed, refusing to answer the 
question as he suddenly made a break for it, running across the 
near by clearing where several people were playing soccer, 
followed by a suddenly very confused Bow.

&quot;You&#39;d better be there!&quot; his niece called after him, both anger 
and amusement in her tone as Misty chuckled.

&quot;He&#39;s worse than Nezumi,&quot; commented Misty as Miranda gave up, 
shaking her head in dismay.

&quot;Naw, Nezumi&#39;s worse,&quot; the courier replied resting her chin in her 
hand as she slowly swung at fry in front of Nezumi&#39;s snout to get 
his attention, &quot;and as you said. Good thing he&#39;s so darn cute, or 
I&#39;d kick his butt!&quot;

The rattata leapt up and snatched the french-fry in both fore 
paws. &#39;I like him!&#39; he commented in pokespeak with a wide grin as 
he bit the fry in half.

&quot;You would!&quot; Miranda chuckled defeatedly before reaching her hand 
across the table to take Misty&#39;s. &quot;You okay?&quot; she asked kindly.

&quot;Fine,&quot; Misty said with a nod that said it was only half true, 
&quot;But, would you mind if we stopped by my parent&#39;s grave before we 
left.&quot;

&quot;Not at all,&quot; Miranda replied, giving her beloved&#39;s hand a 
reassuring squeeze. 

Misty looked up, her sea green eyes full of love and sadness. 
&quot;Miri,&quot; she said quietly with a smile that made her lover&#39;s heart 
melt, &quot;I love you...&quot;</pre>
