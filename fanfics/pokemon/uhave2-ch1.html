<h1>You'd Have to See it to Believe</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/danachan.html">dana-chan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Notes: YHTSITB is written in Magical Pokemon Journey (Pokemon 
PiPiPi) canon -- MPJ being the official Pokemon shoujo manga. I have 
say about eight or so issues, and I was re-reading them while fighting 
a bout of insomnia and I was inspired for this fanfic.

I know about nothing when it comes to the original Japanese of this 
series, so all of the info here is based on the English translated 
version. MPJ is a really cute fluffy manga and if you have the chance, 
go out and buy it and see what I mean. ^_^

Continuity wise, I have no idea where this would fit in -- I&#39;m missing 
a lot of the manga, so it makes it difficult for it to be set. Let&#39;s 
just say that it&#39;s set after Coconut shows up so she&#39;s ready, willing, 
and able to be the evil scientist-type that she is.

Written in said evil scientist-type&#39;s POV.

Please excuse discrepancies in characterization. Please? I think 
Eevee&#39;s just... in a... mood... And yes, for those who haven&#39;t read 
MJP, Eevee does speak the human tongue. Nya!

------------------------------------------------------------

This really is going to be my crowning glory... holding the bottle up 
of pale perfume, I watch the light refract through the liquid gold 
within the decanter. A grin slips onto my lips, and I feel myself 
begin to laugh. It shortly turns into a full-fledged cackle.

&quot;He won&#39;t be able to resist me, not after he gets a whiff of this!&quot; I 
trill, and then feel my shoulders hunch over as I share a giggle with 
myself. &quot;Almond won&#39;t know what hit him, and poor widdle Hazel will be 
left all alone out in the cold!&quot;

I laugh again, throwing my head back and letting the effects 
reverberate through my body. Finally I, the magnificent Coconut, will 
have my fifteen minutes of fame -- and I&#39;ll win Almond&#39;s love in the 
process!

&quot;Are you going to keep cackling like that, some Pokemon are trying to 
sleep you know!&quot; Eevee&#39;s voice calls to me, and I scowl indignantly in 
its direction.

&quot;Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m trying to have a moment?&quot; I demand, and it peeks at 
me from behind a paw.

&quot;I can, and I can also see that you&#39;re keeping me awake!&quot;

I sigh. &quot;You just don&#39;t understand...&quot;

I turn my attention back to the sparkling bottle, and smile. &quot;You&#39;re 
going to be mine, Almond. You&#39;re going to be all mine...&quot;

&quot;I think someone has issues,&quot; Eevee mutters, and my eyebrow twitches 
and yet I don&#39;t turn back to face it. Instead, I slide the clear top 
off the bottle and then close my eyes, spritzing the perfume onto my 
neck.

It smells... sort of strange... but I know it&#39;ll do the job!

&quot;Well, how do I look?&quot; I croon, spinning round. Eevee opens one eye 
slowly, then tilts it&#39;s head to the side.

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t I be drooling all over you about now if this perfume is 
strong enough to get you your Almond&#39;s love?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; I scowl. &quot;I made sure that this perfume will only effect 
humans... which means when Almond sees me...&quot; I can barely refrain 
from dancing. &quot;He&#39;s going to fall head over heels in love with me!&quot;

Eevee nods slowly. &quot;And I haven&#39;t heard this one a half million times 
before...&quot;

&quot;You just want to rain on my parade,&quot; I groan, capping the bottle back 
off again and smiling at it in a daze. &quot;Sweet Almond, wait for me... 
I&#39;m coming for you! Together, our love will last forever!&quot;

&quot;And so modest!&quot; Eevee exclaims.

I shoot one last glare at the Pokemon, and it buries its head under 
its paws. &quot;You really just don&#39;t understand!&quot; I say, and then pocket 
the bottle. &quot;Wish me luck,&quot; and at that, I laugh, throwing my head 
back and cackling like a mad woman.

&quot;Wait, I don&#39;t need luck -- true love is on my side!&quot;

With that, I snatch up my jacket to run from the lab, out into the 
bright sunny day. There&#39;s love in the air -- and his name is Almond!

This doesn&#39;t seem to be my lucky day, however, because the first 
person I run into while on my way to find Almond is... the one and 
only Hazel herself.

I sneer at the young girl, fighting a strange twinge in my chest at 
the sight of her. Oh well, at least I can rub in the approach of my 
imminent victory in her snide little face... &quot;Why hello, Hazel...&quot;

She eyes me warily, and obviously misses the point of my superior 
smirk. &quot;Good afternoon, Coconut. What are you up to today?&quot;

Really. Children. &quot;Oh...&quot; I grin. &quot;Just on my way to...&quot; my voice 
trails off, and I find myself staring at her, right into her eyes. I 
blink, and smack my cheek harshly. Uh, what&#39;s wrong with me?

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; she asks, and cutting through the layers, I think 
there might be a hint of concern in her voice.

&quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; I reply, laughing nervously. &quot;I&#39;m fine... you have 
beautiful eyes, Hazel. They&#39;re such a lovely colour...&quot;

My eyes widen at the compliment that just slipped through my lips -- 
the worst part being who it was directed at. I clamp a hand over my 
mouth, and Hazel&#39;s pretty eyes widen as well. &quot;W-why Coconut...&quot; she 
fumbles for a moment. &quot;Thank you?&quot;

I shrug weakly, and drop my hand so that it hangs at my side. &quot;You&#39;re 
welcome.&quot;

&quot;I should be going, Pikachu is going to want --&quot; she starts to walk 
past me, and unconsciously I reach out and hold a hand before her.

&quot;Are you really sure you want to go? I mean it&#39;s such a lovely day... 
why don&#39;t we take a walk?&quot; Ugh, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong with me 
but... whatever it is it&#39;s giving me a headache. Maybe this will teach 
me to make sure the sushi is all the way fresh before sitting down to 
a meal...

Hazel blinks and steps before me, reaching up and waving an outspread 
hand up and down before my eyes. I follow the motion, and Hazel 
scowls. &quot;All right, something is definitely wrong with you, Coconut.&quot;

&quot;And why&#39;s that?&quot; I grate out between gritted teeth.

&quot;You&#39;re being nice to me, Coconut. That defies all logic!&quot; she 
exclaims. Her eyes widen, then, and she gasps. She leans close, and I 
can feel breath curling off my cheek. A rush of warmth chases down my 
spine, and Hazel&#39;s hand is pressed palm forward against my forehead.

&quot;Hrm,&quot; murmurs the girl. &quot;You don&#39;t feel sick... but maybe you should 
lie down, none-the-less. You&#39;re acting awfully creepy!&quot;

Hazel leans back and I let my held in breath out in a sigh. &quot;I&#39;m 
really okay,&quot; I reply, even though I know I&#39;m not. What could possibly 
be...?

My thoughts are derailed again, this time by another plunge into the 
depths of her eyes. &quot;Oh Hazel...&quot; I murmur, leaning close -- and then 
it suddenly rushes over me, what&#39;s wrong, and I clamp a hand over my 
mouth and jerk back away from her.

&quot;Uh, Coco --&quot;

&quot;I-I... think I will go lie down now... yes, I will...&quot; I stumble back 
away from her, and Hazel&#39;s face grows more and more comical as I do 
so. She probably thinks I lost it... that I&#39;m crazy... the fact that I 
want to kiss her makes me think that she&#39;s probably right.

I turn from the girl, and run back towards the lab. Maybe I can gather 
myself back together, hope this urge fades with the perfume, and then 
find a way to get Almond to sample it for me... I&#39;m cackling as I 
enter the lab, feeling a bit like the old Coconut.

I close the door behind me, and lean against it. I slip the stoppered 
vial from my pocket, and sigh. &quot;And I was so close... at least I can 
still use it to my best...&quot;

&quot;So, you&#39;re back early!&quot; Eevee exclaims, jumping off a tabletop near 
the door to site before me, and scaring me half to death. The vial 
slips from my hand, and shatters against the tiled floor...

&quot;Nooo...&quot; I moan.

&quot;Oh, cheer up,&quot; Eevee titters nervously. &quot;It&#39;s not like it would have 
worked...&quot;

&quot;Oh, but this was the one!&quot; I wail, and then glare at my Pokemon. I 
then sigh, knowing that I&#39;m rather pathetically defeated. &quot;Well, I 
need to try and salvage what I can of this sample! I...&quot;

Not understanding it for the life of me, Jigglypuff flitters into the 
room, and lands with a soft &quot;puff&quot; on the laboratory floor. I blink, 
and stare, and it waddles right through the spill... soaking up must 
of it as it does... and then floating off with a &quot;jiggly&quot;...

I blink. &quot;Ugh. That was so... really... this is the worst day of my 
life. I lose a working potion, I want to kiss Hazel, and it&#39;s all... 
your... fault!&quot;

Eevee is gawking at me and I&#39;m not sure why. Oh wait. I know why.

&quot;Uh...&quot;

&quot;Backfired, I see.&quot;

&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; I mutter lamely.

Eevee snickers. &quot;You have to tell me!&quot;

I glare at it. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but... you&#39;d have to see it to believe 
it...&quot;

I sigh once more and touch my lips. &quot;Oh well. I guess there&#39;s nothing 
wrong with heading back to the drawing boards... I will have Hazel! 
She will be mine!&quot;

Eevee blinks audibly. &quot;Um.&quot;

&quot;You know I meant Almond!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just not sure anymore!&quot;

&quot;Ooh, when I get my hands on you!&quot; I snap angrily. I suppose work will 
come later... right now, I think I&#39;m up for a bit of revenge.
