<h1>Cerulean Dreams (part 10 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nikolai.html">Nikolai Mirovich</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/cerulean-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Once the crowd had calmed down, and all the contestants had been 
accounted for except for James, the festival coordinator finally 
returned to the stage. He took his time crossing it, the stress of 
the interruption showing upon the old man&#39;s face despite his 
attempts to hide it as he adjusted the microphone to his height. 

&quot;Is this on?&quot; he inquired after a moment, pleased by the way his 
voice echoed through the area, &quot;Okay, now I know that all you 
youngin&#39;s are all hyper over the excitement we just had, and you 
all want to gossip about it, so the judges have decided to speed 
things along a little.&quot;

He waited a few moments for his words to sink in, and to make sure 
that he had everyone&#39;s attention. &quot;Now then,&quot; he continued after 
clearing his throat, and pulling out a small card containing the 
names of the winners, &quot;Our third place winner is; Caitlin Storm of 
Viridian City.&quot;

One section of the crowd immediately applauded louder than all 
rest, throwing in a few cheers just for good measure as a rather 
hyperactive trainer bounced up and down before grabbing her meowth 
and tossing the poor thing into the air several times in her 
elation.  

&quot;We must have missed that one,&quot; commented Misty, noticing that the 
meowth seemed to be enjoying the treatment. Or simply didn&#39;t care.

&quot;That&#39;ll teach us to be late,&quot; Miranda teased, squeezing Misty&#39;s 
hand a little tighter as the old man read off the second name.

&quot;Good luck,&quot; replied Misty, immediately turning her head back to 
face Miranda, carefully watching her expression as the name was 
read aloud.

&quot;The second place winner,&quot; the festival coordinator told the 
audience, &quot;is Josh Thompson of Neon Town.&quot;

Not far away from where they stood, Miranda could see the tall, 
thin man who&#39;d gone before her politely smile and wave to the 
people who glanced at him, but otherwise remain silent.

&quot;Our second and third place winners will both receive free passes 
to the park for the remainder of the Festival,&quot; continued the old 
man, obviously anxious to leave the stage and sit down somewhere, 
&quot;But first, our first place contestant, and winner of dinner for 
two at &#39;Ces Batards De L&#39;autre Cote De La Rue&#39; is...&quot; He paused 
for a moment, chuckling as he pretended to shuffle through the 
three cards he held concealed in his hands.

&quot;I have faith in you,&quot; whispered Misty with a smile, watching as 
Miranda stared intently at the figure on stage, barely breathing, 
and suddenly sweating despite the cool breeze that passed over 
her.

&quot;Miranda Lilcamp of Lavender Town!&quot; the old man called out, 
grinning broadly as she joined the applause spread throughout the 
crowd, &quot;Now then, would Ms. Lilcamp please come up to accept her 
prize?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s your cue,&quot; giggled Misty, having to give Miranda a small 
push to get her legs working again.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; laughed Miranda, pushing down the nervousness she didn&#39;t 
think she should be feeling, &quot;I owe it all to you.&quot;

Misty smiled happily, applauding as loudly as she could as Miranda 
walked towards the stage on legs that felt as thought they were 
made of straw. Yay, Miranda!&quot; she called, causing the rattata on 
her lover&#39;s shoulder to turn around and grin mischievously, &quot;Way 
to show &#39;em how it&#39;s done!&quot;

The festival coordinator smiled and held out his hand to Miranda 
as she walked back up the stairs and over to the mike once again. 
&quot;Congratulations,&quot; he told her, his voice echoing via the 
microphone as he took Miranda&#39;s hand and shook it before the 
moment could really sink in, &quot;how about a few words while we find 
you those passes?&quot;

Miranda smiled, hoping she didn&#39;t look as silly as her elation 
made her feel. &quot;No problem,&quot; she told him before taking her place 
at the mike and scanning the crowd for Misty. 

&quot;Okay,&quot; she said at last, catching sight of the smiling water-
trainer as Nezumi stared out at the sea of people before him in 
amazement, &quot;I really don&#39;t know what you want to me to say, but I 
think just a general &#39;thanks&#39; is most appropriate. It was fun, and 
I intend to make the most of my prize. Thanks...&quot; 

Miranda stepped back from the microphone as the spectators 
applauded and the old man returned with a peculiar gleam in his 
eye and an envelope. &quot;Here you are,&quot; he said simply holding it out 
to her and glancing at the sea of people, &quot;enjoy your prize, Ms. 
Lilcamp.&quot;

Miranda nodded, and was about to thank him again when Nezumi let 
out a sudden quiet hiss. &quot;Nezumi?&quot; she inquired quietly, accepting 
the envelope and glancing in puzzlement at her rattata, &quot;What is 
it, dearest?&quot;

The rattata&#39;s eyes gleamed with suspicion as he watched the old 
man motioned for the crowd to cheer louder. &quot;Ra ra, &#39;zumi,&quot; the 
rodent muttered under his breath, his snout close to his trainer&#39;s 
ear as he spoke.

&quot;I see,&quot; replied Miranda, her feelings of elation being pushed 
aside by the suspicious doubt her pokemon had placed in her mind, 
&quot;Let&#39;s go while can.&quot;

The courier gave the old man a wide birth as he turned to face 
her, still grinning broadly and applauding heartily. 
&quot;Congratulations!&quot; he called after her as Miranda headed down the 
stairs, &quot;You deserve it, Miss! Way to go!&quot;

&quot;Looks like you were right!&quot; laughed Misty, bounding out of 
nowhere and flinging her arms around Miranda, &quot;You did win!&quot;

&quot;Um, yeah,&quot; chuckled Miranda dryly, smiling as best she could as 
she met Misty&#39;s happy gaze, &quot;Mind if I talk to you for a second?&quot;

Misty gave her a suspicious look, searching for any sign of 
elation in Miranda&#39;s eyes and finding only thoughtful worry. 
&quot;Okay...&quot; she agreed reluctantly, letting Miranda take her hand 
and lead her away from the stage and the main mass of the crowd...

***

&quot;It&#39;s Nezumi,&quot; explained Miranda once they&#39;d found a park bench 
and had sat down.

&quot;Oh?&quot; inquired Misty, holing out a finger and scratching the 
rattata under the chin affectionately, causing Nezumi to relax to 
the point where he nearly lost his footing.

&quot;He sensed something about the festival coordinator,&quot; explained 
Miranda as she opened the envelope she&#39;d won, &quot;Something he didn&#39;t 
like.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not good,&quot; agreed Misty, half a smile remaining on her 
face as Nezumi tilted his head way back and stood helpless upon 
his haunches, letting her finger gently scratch the nape of this 
neck as the rattata exaggerated his approval, &quot;He usually likes 
everybody.&quot;

&quot;If you can see past the sarcastic, often off-colour remarks he 
makes about them,&quot; the rattata&#39;s trainer agreed, smiling lovingly 
despite her mock disapproval as she tilted her head to one side in 
order to brush her cheek against Nezumi&#39;s soft, purplish fur.

Misty laughed as the rattata made a happy noise and flung his 
forepaws about Miranda&#39;s neck. &quot;Nez, ra rattata,&quot; he assured, 
closing his eyes and smiling contentedly.

&quot;Although something must have really freaked him out if he&#39;s being 
that affectionate without being sarcastic,&quot; commented Misty, 
starting to catch on to Nezumi&#39;s voice inflections, and just a 
little bit of the rodent pokemon&#39;s words, &quot;Did he say what is was 
precisely?&quot;

Miranda shook her head as she extracted Nezumi from her neck and 
out him in her lap before shuffling closer to Misty. &quot;He&#39;s not 
sure,&quot; she explained, putting an arm around her beloved as she 
examined the two tickets in her other hand, &quot;there was just 
something very... &#39;Unnatural&#39; about him.&quot;

&quot;Any ideas?&quot; inquired Misty, leaning her head on Miranda&#39;s 
shoulder and smiling to herself as Nezumi made himself comfortable 
in the small crevasse where their legs touched. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; admitted Miranda, glancing down at Nezumi and smiling as 
the rattata made it perfectly clear to any passers by that the two 
humans were &#39;his&#39;, &quot;But I don&#39;t like my suspicions. Remember what 
Kathy said about dittos?&quot;

Misty shuddered at the thought, not even wanting to contemplate 
what the scientist must have done to synthesize their metamorphic 
abilities. &quot;Unfortunately,&quot; she admitted.

Miranda nodded. &quot;What was her accomplice&#39;s name, again?&quot; she 
inquired rhetorically, &quot;Oh yes. Victor. Strange that someone like 
him would be so close to someone like her.&quot;

&quot;You mean because he&#39;s so attractive?&quot; inquired Misty, with a 
smirk.

&quot;Yeah, I suppose I&#39;m just being superficial,&quot; the woman agreed 
thoughtfully, &quot;but it does make me wonder why, if she can change 
her face, she doesn&#39;t wear a more pleasant one.&quot;

&quot;Bones,&quot; replied Misty thoughtfully, &quot;A while back I- &#39;We&#39;; met 
this girl who specialized in training dittos. They&#39;re just globs 
of pinkish goo in their true form, and even when they transform 
they&#39;re really only imitating solidity. Maybe Kathy&#39;s actual 
facial structure makes it so she can&#39;t improve her looks, just 
change them.&quot;

&quot;Makes sense, I suppose,&quot; agreed Miranda with a shrug, glancing 
down at the now snoozing Nezumi, &quot;It&#39;s not a big limitation, but 
it means that there&#39;s only so many faces she can wear, right?&quot;

&quot;At least two others that we know of,&quot; added Misty, breaking her 
reverie and looking up at Miranda until the courier turned to face 
her.

&quot;Yes, the one she wore at the Sylph Co installation, and the one 
she showed up with today,&quot; Miranda paused for a moment, turning to 
look into Misty&#39;s eyes, searching for the moral support she knew 
she&#39;d find, &quot;But I suppose that Kathy was right. If she&#39;d had that 
ability the day she went after Selece and Undine, my father would 
probably still be alive.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; said Misty sadly, &quot;I think she was right. Kathy probably 
would have wanted no witnesses irregardless of her face changing 
power. Or worse, she might simply have impersonated your parent&#39;s 
voices and lured the dragons out into a trap. I&#39;ve seen that trick 
before.&quot;

&quot;I hadn&#39;t thought of it that way,&quot; said Miranda sadly, staring at 
the ground at her feet.

&quot;I, I&#39;m sorry...&quot; whispered Misty, searching Miranda&#39;s eyes for 
the tears that didn&#39;t seem to want to come.

&quot;No, it&#39;s alright,&quot; assured Miranda, forcing a weak smile to her 
lips, &quot;You&#39;ve given me the strength to move on. And now that I 
know she&#39;s here in this city somewhere, there&#39;s finally some hope 
that&#39;ll I&#39;ll catch up to her. But most importantly, my love, 
you&#39;ve shown me two very important things.&quot;

&quot;And what are they?&quot; inquired Misty, her heart feeling as though 
it were lodged in her throat, as a mix of uncertain emotions 
fought for supremacy within her.

Miranda&#39;s smile returned, and her gray eyes filled with love as 
she spoke. &quot;You&#39;ve shown me how easy it is to fall in love a 
second time,&quot; she explained, giving Misty a playfully teasing kiss 
upon her nose, &quot;And you&#39;ve shown me something far more important 
than just revenge. No one else has ever done that.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve been in love before?&quot; inquired Misty, inwardly chastising 
herself for the sudden surge of jealously she felt.

Miranda nodded, smiling sadly. &quot;Yes,&quot; she admitted guiltily, &quot;Long 
before I even knew you existed, &quot;That&#39;s one reason why it bothered 
me to see poorly Ash treated you. I sorta know what it&#39;s like...&quot;

Misty&#39;s eyes went wide for a moment as the revelation sank in. 
&quot;How long were you together?&quot; she inquired nervously, not 
completely certain if she really wanted know, but willing to talk 
about anything that would take Miranda&#39;s mind off Kathy. 

&quot;Five, five months,&quot; answered Miranda hesitantly, suddenly looking 
away sadly, &quot;Misty, I...&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;I promise not to leave you like that,&quot; said Miranda rather 
quickly, turning back to meet her beloved&#39;s discerning gaze once 
more, &quot;And that poem I wrote, just for you. It was more than a 
promise; it&#39;s an oath. You&#39;re the only I&#39;ll be with so long as 
we&#39;re together.&quot;

Misty reached up, careful not to disturb Nezumi, and put both arms 
around Miranda. &quot;Your previous lover,&quot; she inquired softly, 
without malice, only concerned love, &quot;Was unfaithful?&quot;

Miranda nodded. &quot;I really should have confided in you sooner,&quot; she 
responded, guiltily, &quot;But it&#39;s something I&#39;ve put far behind me. 
It was only yesterday when your sister tried to seduce me that it 
all came back to me. I- I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever felt that 
horrible. Even though I didn&#39;t do anything, I felt... I felt just 
like I had done something. Is this making any sense whatsoever?&quot;

Misty&#39;s smile was reassuring, as she gave Miranda a small kiss. 
&quot;Yes,&quot; she agreed with a little nod, &quot;And I don&#39;t want you to 
worry about it. I have no more right to be jealous of this person 
that I&#39;ve never even met, than you have to be Ash, right?&quot;

Miranda found it nearly impossible not to smile, and Misty 
chuckled at the woman&#39;s attempt not to. &quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; she 
agreed, smiling broadly as she glanced at Misty overtop of her 
glasses, &quot;I bow to your superior logic, M&#39;Lady.&quot;

&quot;So we&#39;re even, then?&quot; laughed Misty, giving Miranda an impulsive 
kiss.

&quot;Mmm, mostly...&quot; responded Miranda, glancing around 
conspiratorially, &quot;But I think this is where a horde of ex lovers 
are supposed to come streaming out the woodwork.&quot;

&quot;And if they do?&quot; inquired Misty in a mock tone of suspicion.

&quot;Then I&#39;ll banish every last one from my site!&quot; assured Miranda, 
announcing it as though it were a proclamation.

&quot;Good!&quot; laughed Misty, kissing her lover again, &quot;But one question. 
How many people have you been with?&quot;

Miranda&#39;s mirth suddenly vanished once more as her stomach started 
becoming used to the emotional roller coaster the day was 
becoming. &quot;In total? Three,&quot; she admitted solemnly, somehow 
finding the strength to not break eye contact, &quot;But the second one 
was more like therapy.&quot; 

&quot;Oooh, a rebound relationship,&quot; teased Misty, desperately hiding 
her sudden feeling of insecurity.

&quot;Kinda,&quot; agreed Miranda, feeling both embarrassed and guilty, &quot;But 
it was more like someone not being able to stand seeing me having 
such a difficult time. I don&#39;t regret that &#39;relationship&#39; and 
perhaps because of it, I know that I&#39;ll never regret this one.&quot;

Misty nodded, and Miranda could see that she was thinking hard 
about something. &quot;Well, you&#39;re the first person I&#39;ve ever &#39;been&#39; 
with,&quot; she admitted, &quot;But now I can&#39;t help wonder if you might 
compare me to the others...&quot;

&quot;Oh, I do!&quot; laughed Miranda with a mischievous grin, catching 
Misty off guard, &quot;And they were terrible lovers compared to you!&quot;

It took a moment for Misty&#39;s brain to shift tracks as Miranda 
found both her hands and kissed them both. &quot;But I can think of 
about ten or so someone&#39;s you were with long before you found me,&quot; 
she teased, smiling as Misty&#39;s eyes went wide with sudden 
befuddlement.

&quot;T-Ten?!&quot; Misty stammered as the laughing courier took hold of her 
index finger.

&quot;Yup!&quot; agreed Miranda, waggling the captured digit, &quot;Here&#39;s one 
now!&quot;

&quot;Oh-!&quot; exclaimed Misty, not having time to be embarrassed before 
Miranda grabbed her next finger.

&quot;And here&#39;s another!&quot; exclaimed Miranda mirthfully, giving the 
finger a playful tug before moving on, &quot;And another! And another! 
And another-!&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; laughed Misty, laughing uncontrollably as Miranda tugged at 
her fingers and proclaimed them to be another of her secret 
lovers, &quot;You&#39;re embarrassing me!&quot;

&quot;Then fight back,&quot; laughed Miranda, grabbing Misty&#39;s thumb, &quot;Oh! I 
didn&#39;t know he was you&#39;re type, Misty!&quot;

&quot;You-!&quot; the trainer laughed yanking back her hand before darting 
them forward, finding Miranda&#39;s ribs almost instantly.

&quot;No-!&quot; shrieked Miranda, laughing and hardly caring how silly she 
sounded, as Misty&#39;s fingers ruthlessly tickled her sides, &quot;Hey, no 
fair!&quot;

&quot;Oooh!&quot; teased Misty as Nezumi managed to extricate himself and 
promptly hid underneath the bench where it was reasonably safe, &quot;I 
didn&#39;t know you were ticklish!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not!&quot; laughed Miranda, not even trying to make the lie sound 
convincing as she was forced onto her back into a near fetal 
position by Misty&#39;s tickling tactic.

&quot;Yeah, and I hate ice-cream!&quot; countered Misty, leaning over 
Miranda and stopping short of kissing her, yet not letting up, 
&quot;You know, if you kiss me, I&#39;ll stop.&quot;

Miranda managed to open one eye, and desperately tried to bring 
her lips together. &quot;You-!&quot; she gasped, laughing as she struggled 
to even raise her head enough, &quot;You&#39;re so mean!&quot;

&quot;Come on,&quot; teased Misty, smiling broadly as her fingers wriggled 
their way down Miranda&#39;s sides, &quot;You can do it!&quot;

&quot;Um, would you two like to be alone...?&quot; came a familiar half 
concerned, half amused voice, breaking Misty&#39;s concentration, and 
giving Miranda a moment to breath.

&quot;Uncle Frank!&quot; Miranda exclaimed theatrically from her awkward 
position, her arms and legs out at odd, uncomfortable angles as 
she turned her head to face the Pokeforce Officer, &quot;It&#39;s not what 
you think!&quot;

&quot;Oh Miranda!&quot; the cop replied with equal melodrama, throwing the 
back of his and against his forehead, &quot;What will I tell the 
children?!&quot;

&quot;That you&#39;re both completely crazy?&quot; offered Misty with an amused 
smile as she rested her head on Miranda&#39;s chest as her lover 
caught her breath.

&quot;Guilty as charged!&quot; laughed Frank as his growlithe peeked out 
from behind him, &quot;But I just thought you both might like to know 
that Jenny&#39;s fine, and the perp&#39;s awake if you&#39;d like to talk to 
him.&quot;

&quot;You, you&#39;d let me?&quot; inquired Miranda, her tone suddenly serious, 
here teary ears going wide with astonished endearment. 

&quot;Hey, how can I say no to my favorite niece?&quot; inquired Frank 
stepping aside as Nezumi crept out of hiding and ran over to Bow.

&quot;I&#39;m your only niece!&quot; laughed Miranda pushing herself and Misty 
up to a more dignified position as the two pokemon got 
reacquainted.

&quot;And even then,&quot; she continued secretively, &quot;That&#39;s conditional.&quot;

&quot;I-! Ah-!&quot; stammered Frank, clutching his heart and looking hurt, 
&quot;You&#39;d stop calling me &#39;Uncle&#39;? Miri, how could you?!&quot;

&quot;You know I wouldn&#39;t do that,&quot; assured Miranda glancing down at 
Nezumi who seemed rather annoyed about having wipe growlithe 
slobber off himself, &quot;You&#39;re my favorite uncle first, and my 
favorite friend of the family second. But if you&#39;d just have 
married Aunt Laurna...&quot;

&quot;Okay!&quot; exclaimed Frank, clapping his hands together loudly, &quot;Who 
wants to go down to the station and interrogate criminals?!&quot;

&quot;Someone&#39;s avoiding the subject,&quot; chuckled Misty under her breath 
and trying not to be too embarrassed about getting caught in such 
an awkward position.

&quot;Long story,&quot; assured Miranda with a smile as Bow began running 
around Frank&#39;s feet excitedly at her trainer&#39;s use of the word 
&#39;Go&#39;, &quot;Ask me later...&quot;
