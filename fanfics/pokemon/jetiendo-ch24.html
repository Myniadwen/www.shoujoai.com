<h1>Jetiendo (part 24 of 38)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/jetiendo-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>Ant and Dec&#39;s was over. Davis was clogged with embarrassment. Brock was 
very quiet. Max was still in hospital, since Ash and May where going 
out, he felt left out, usually Davis would talk to him, Davis had been 
punished half the lesson. Brock left the monastary and walked into the 
hospital, he streets where dangerous. Now He understood racism very well 
as being black himself, his friends never even tried to call him words 
like nigger, wog, monkey ect.&#39; Because they where true friends.

He was appalled of the sight of blood, homelessness, rape and violence 
around him.

It was so dangerous he ran so fast he was the wind. He was a bullet from 
million miles away heading for the hospital.

He skidded to the hospital his sudden speed change made him slide on the 
floor he was an ice skater now. Then in Max&#39;s room there was just an 
empty bed. Then Dr Mario came to him.

&quot; Max has been moved to the psychiatric area&quot;

&quot; He not mental&quot; Brock shouted out

&quot; His condition has got worse we believe it&#39;s a rare disease, or a 
phobia of people blowing peoples brains out&quot; Dr Mario announced

&quot; If only the king would let him out,&quot; Brock hissed to him &quot; see what is 
happening.&quot;

Meanwhile at break Kari was alone at break T.K was sitting alone on the 
fresh green grass. Kari thought it was time to talk

&quot; Can I sit here?&quot; Kari asked T.K politely

&quot;Yeah&quot; T.K replied coldly. Kari sat down, a couple that just split up 
would never do this unless they still fancied each other. Their heads 
said no don&#39;t look at each over. Their hearts said go on do it fall in 
love again. They both intended to look at each over as a standard 
person; they fell into temptation they looked with their lips instead of 
their eyes

&quot;We should get back together again,&quot; Kari whispered.

&quot; Yeah we should&quot; T.K hissed as if he had a plan up his sleeve, it&#39;s too 
disgusting to tell.

&quot; Any way im getting bored of this trip now the only thing we see is 
sadness

And also this stupid pathetic madness&quot; Kari&#39;s couplet

&quot;We should go somewhere tonight&quot; T.K advised &quot; not get drunk coz that&#39;s 
what split us up.&quot;

&quot;Where were you thinking&quot; Kari hissed she was eventually turning into 
Angelica

&quot;Simon Cowell has two mansions near the monastary&quot; T.K replied &quot; how 
about their tonight.

&quot; Yeah &quot; hissed Kari.
