<h1>Rainbow Reminiscence (part 4 of 18)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nikolai.html">Nikolai Mirovich</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/rainbow-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Samantha smiled, trying to contain her amusement at the uncomfortable 
looking expression that crossed Miranda&#39;s face as she came back out into 
the hall. The loose fitting, floor-length garment had once belonged to 
one of Erika&#39;s aunts who had lived in Lavender for sometime and had had 
it made in the town&#39;s colours. The courier, however, filled it out quite 
nicely, even though her stormy gray eyes mirrored her discomfort at 
having to wear such a garment.

&quot;Back we go,&quot; the apprentice commented, taking the lead, as not to upset 
Miranda with the amused grin she couldn&#39;t hide. &#39;Ah, tomboys,&#39; she 
sighed inwardly as the courier shuffled uncomfortably along behind her, 
&#39;we don&#39;t get many of those here... Still, it should be interesting to 
see what Erika thinks of her.&#39;

The two re-entered the common room just as a small quiet figure 
approached them from the opposite direction. &quot;M&#39;Lady,&quot; replied Samantha, 
giving Erika respectful bow as the Gym Leader glided around the corner, 
the distant look in her eyes making the woman seem to almost be unaware 
of their presence, &quot;This is this courier I mentioned. Miss...?&quot;

&quot;Just Miranda, thanks,&quot; the courier corrected, stammering a little as 
she smiled nervously at her hostess and held out her hand, &quot;My Mom&#39;s got 
the monopoly on titles. They&#39;re really not me...&quot;

Without uttering a word, Erika raised her index finger, signaling that 
she needed a moment. Her guest cut off her suddenly uncontrollably 
babbling and nodded, trying to discern what thought had so consumed the 
diminutive Gym Leader. &#39;Still waters run deep,&#39; Miranda reminded herself 
as Erika thoughtfully tapped her lips with her finger before a look of 
joyous enlightenment crossed her pretty face.

&quot;Oh, sorry about that,&quot; Erika apologized, finally looking up at Miranda 
with a warm smile and a gleam in her deep emerald eyes, &quot;Some times the 
ethereal gets the better of me.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s alright,&quot; assured Miranda, a feeling of panic creeping up her 
spine as she suddenly recalled the water resistant clip board and small 
heavy package she&#39;d left in the common room along with her backpack, 
&quot;But if you don&#39;t mind, miss, I seem to have left your package in the 
other room.&quot;

Erika shrugged, closing her eyes for a moment as if savoring some 
private thought. &quot;Concern yourself not,&quot; the woman assured with a fluid 
wave of her small hand, &quot;My girls are all quite trustworthy, and none of 
them will have disturbed your or my belongings without permission. In 
the mean time I shall wait here for you to retrieve them.&quot;

Miranda nodded, nearly falling over as she tried to turn too quickly in 
the dark kimono that seemed intent on entangling her legs before 
scurrying off into the common room once more.

&quot;She&#39;s not used to feminine attire,&quot; commented Samantha with a weary 
sigh, watching through the doorway as Miranda hurriedly collected her 
belongings and downed the rest of the tea she&#39;d been given.

&quot;I noticed,&quot; replied Erika, her smile having faded as she stared off 
thoughtfully once again, &quot;I also saw that that girl is quite troubled.&quot;

Samantha blinked, glancing from Miranda to Erika as she tried to see 
that which only Erika seemed capable of perceiving. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she 
offered, &quot;she&#39;s a bit awkward, and probably rather annoyed at herself 
for being caught out in the rain. Not to mention being nervous about 
being in a new place-&quot;

Erika silenced her apprentice with a raised index finger and a sad 
smile. &quot;There are subtleties of human expression that you have yet to 
master, dearest,&quot; the woman explained, lowering her voice as Miranda 
returned, &quot;but we shall see if my intuition is correct.&quot;

Samantha nodded, accepting Erika&#39;s appraisal as she always did, 
understanding that the woman had wisdom far beyond her years. &quot;So?&quot; she 
inquired perkily as Miranda returned with a nervous smile upon her lips, 
&quot;To the garden then?&quot;

Erika smiled, keeping her excitement contained within her calm, almost 
passive demeanor. &quot;Indeed,&quot; Gym Leader said cryptically, giving Miranda 
an amused glance as the courier flipped through several of the pages 
attached to her clipboard, &quot;If you would, miss?&quot;

Miranda nodded, her teeth chewing the end of the pen she held in her 
mouth as her eyes narrowed, the new forms the company was using sparking 
the courier&#39;s annoyance. &quot;Righ&#39; &#39;ind &#39;ou,&quot; she replied, shuffling in 
comparison to her usual stride as not to simple wander past her almost 
gliding hostess as they took a short trip down the circling hallway.

The woman glanced at her apprentice a short time later and smiled subtly 
as the doors to the arboretum swished open, the sweat scent of a hundred 
mingled flower varieties wafting out from within. &quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind 
my enthusiasm in regards to the item you&#39;ve brought me,&quot; she said to 
Miranda as the girl shook her head in mild amazement.

&quot;Not a problem,&quot; the courier responded, her gaze casting about the room 
in awe of the size of the garden and smiling as she remembered the 
greenhouse her paternal grandFather had once built. &#39;You could probably 
fit about thirty or forty of them in here,&#39; she pondered, finding the 
pages she needed as Erika sat down on a bench near a bed of large orange 
petaled flowers with dark centers.

&quot;Have you found the places your company wishes me to sigh, miss?&quot; Erika 
inquired politely, motioning for the others to sit as well.

Miranda nodded, flipping over several pages before turning the clipboard 
around and handing it and a pen to the Gym Leader. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind me 
asking,&quot; she said conversationally as she turned around and tried to 
figure out how she was going to sit down on the wooden bench in the 
outfit they&#39;d given her to wear, &quot;What pokemon are you using the stone 
on?&quot;

Erika signed her name in three places and handed the clipboard back with 
a small shake of her head. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s alright,&quot; she assured, producing a 
pokeball from somewhere within the folds of her silken kimono, &quot;I&#39;m 
using it on my weepinbel Triffid. If I&#39;m going to be a challenge for you 
young trainers it&#39;s best if I take the time to upgrade her.&quot;

Miranda nodded thoughtfully, her stormy gray eyes full of reminiscence 
for a moment before she smiled and shook her head. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m just a 
courier really, so I&#39;m afraid you won&#39;t get a challenge out of me,&quot; she 
explained with a shrug, &quot;Although my Father had a plant-type like that 
when I was younger. My mentor Joshua got him the stone to evolve Treeant 
for my Father&#39;s birthday one year...&quot;

Erika caught the sadness in Miranda&#39;s tone and sent Samantha a nearly 
imperceptible glance. &quot;Well,&quot; she said carefully, expanding the pokeball 
from storage mode, &quot;Being a courier must have its risks. Surely your 
Father wouldn&#39;t send you traveling alone-&quot;

&quot;My Father&#39;s dead,&quot; Miranda said simply, her tone cold as her distant 
gaze made the girl seemingly disconnected from reality in the 
uncomfortable silence that followed.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; came Erika&#39;s whispered reply, but Miranda barely noticed.

&quot;You&#39;re right, though,&quot; the courier said at last, closing her eyes and 
channeling her Mother&#39;s strength to hold back the tears of the memory 
that refused to fade, &quot;I don&#39;t travel alone. He gave me a dratini to 
raise when I was a child and my Aunt gave me a rattata shortly before I 
left home.&quot;

&quot;You must be from Lavender, then,&quot; Erika inferred, watching Miranda&#39;s 
reactions carefully, and taking note of the subtle changes in the girl&#39;s 
expression, &quot;The Professor there gives rattatas, bellsprouts and pidgey 
to those who leave home for the first time as I recall.&quot;

&quot;My Aunt&#39;s Professor Laurna,&quot; Miranda explained, glancing sideways at 
Erika whose expression betrayed only sympathy, but whose mind was 
quickly processing information.

&quot;You didn&#39;t mention your last name was Lilcamp,&quot; Erika said simply, her 
tone neither surprised nor concerned.

&quot;I didn&#39;t think it was important,&quot; said Miranda with a shrug, &quot;I&#39;m 
really just another courier when it comes right down to it. Of course, 
some people seem to think otherwise.&quot;

Erika moved a little closer, placing her hand carefully next to 
Miranda&#39;s. &quot;Is there something you&#39;d like to talk about?&quot; she inquired, 
catching the agitation in the courier&#39;s tone.

Miranda shook her head slowly, her gaze fixed upon the neatly trimmed 
lawn at her feet, barely noticing the warmth of Erika&#39;s hand as it slid 
over her own. 

&quot;Sometimes, it&#39;s better not to hold these things in,&quot; the woman 
persisted gently, her tone soft and thoughtful.

The courier closed her eyes, inhaling slowly as she gratefully squeezed 
the fingers that linked through her own, surprised to find herself 
thankful for the simple gesture. &quot;My... My reasons for becoming a 
courier probably aren&#39;t the ones that you think they are,&quot; Miranda 
explained pensively, shaking a little as she blinked away the sudden 
irritation she felt.

&quot;So, the need to travel the world, and &#39;find yourself&#39; without parental 
influence had nothing to do with it?&quot; inquired Erika, tilting her head 
curiously as Miranda turned to her with a small smile and a quite 
chuckle.

&quot;No,&quot; the girl replied softly, shaking her head, causing a few loose 
strands of Miranda&#39;s dark bangs fell across her face, obscuring her 
eyes, &quot;I can&#39;t deny that. But... It was more like an escape for me.&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t like the ghosts in Lavender?&quot; came Erika&#39;s innocent sounding 
response, the fact that Miranda could sense that the woman was just 
being silly making the girl snicker, somehow forcing down the dark mood 
that Miranda felt brewing within herself.

&quot;As if!&quot; the courier laughed, shuffling a bit to face her hostess with a 
weak smile, &quot;I get along great with the one&#39;s my Aunt has. But, to be 
honest, it was more of a human problem.&quot;

&quot;The death of your Father?&quot; the Gym Leader inferred carefully.

Miranda shrugged, her smile fading as her gaze moved down to where their 
hands joined. &quot;That too,&quot; she confessed, closing her eyes and taking a 
deep, stabilizing breath, &quot;But there was also Derrick.&quot;

Erika nodded sagely, the amusement leaving her eyes and tone as she 
became suddenly far more serious and concerned. &quot;He didn&#39;t hurt you did 
he?&quot; the woman inquired, the question hanging in the air for a moment 
like dark, brooding cloud.

The courier&#39;s stormy gray eyes seemed thoughtful as a small smirk 
crossed her face. &quot;No,&quot; the girl said quietly, shaking her head and 
meeting Erika&#39;s gaze, &quot;if that were so, he&#39;d still be impaled to a tree 
somewhere out in the Haunted Woods after my mom was finished with him. 
No, Derrick was somewhat more Machiavellian and had other things on his 
mind.&quot;

Erika nodded, a small wave of relief spreading through her, alleviating 
the sudden burning tension in he bones.

&quot;He actually treated my better than I could have hoped, to be honest,&quot; 
continued Miranda, absently biting her lower lip as she sifted through 
her muddled thoughts, &quot;the thing is, is that it was all just an act. One 
big ploy.&quot;

&quot;He wanted something,&quot; said Erika as more of a statement than a 
question, causing her guest to nod slowly.

&quot;Yes,&quot; explained Miranda, her voice quavering a little as she spoke, &quot;My 
Father met his Father on a business trip a while back, and happened to 
mention me.&quot;

Erika smiled, inferring more that seemed possible. &quot;He was proud of you, 
how could he not be?&quot;

The courier blushed a little and went on. &quot;Well, as it turned out, this 
guy had a son, so last year they came to Lavender on the pretence of 
expanding their business. In reality, they were so deeply in dept by 
that point that Derrick&#39;s Father decided his son should just marry into 
money and thus solve all their problems.&quot;

Miranda took another deep breath, exhaling slowly as Erika sat quietly, 
the woman&#39;s patience seeming infinite as her fingers gently held 
Miranda&#39;s, giving them a reassuring squeeze now and then.

&quot;So, anyway,&quot; said Miranda, at last composing herself enough to go on, 
&quot;Derrick quickly insinuated himself into my life, and silly me, I fell 
for him. I dunno, I suppose it was because he almost reminded me of my 
Father. They both always just seemed to know the right things to say. 
Except, that with my Father, it was honest. But with Derrick, it was 
just one big lie. He didn&#39;t want me in his life, he just wanted the 
money he &#39;thought&#39; my family had.&quot;

&quot;The Lilcamp Trading Company does a lot of charitable things to help 
this be a better place for everyone,&quot; Erika agreed, &quot;I&#39;ve read the 
article on it, and from the sounds of things, most of the credits your 
family brings in go right back into the company. Your family isn&#39;t 
greedy or selfish, they keep their prices low, and are sure to keep both 
their employees and customers happy.&quot;

&quot;And above all we&#39;re honest,&quot; said Miranda with a wary shake of her 
head, &quot;It&#39;s a Lavender thing, I guess. We&#39;re really big on it in 
Lavender. It&#39;s almost a tradition that borders on psychosis!&quot;

Erika smiled at the feverance in the courier&#39;s tone. &quot;That&#39;s a little 
melodramatic, don&#39;t you think?&quot; she inquired with a small, bemused 
smile.

Miranda chuckled, the woman&#39;s smile seeming infectious. &quot;Well, you know 
how in most places, say like Neon Town,&quot; she explained, shuddering as 
the courier all but spat out the name of the small, but densely 
populated city, &quot;people will use &#39;How you doing&#39; as a greeting? And 
you&#39;re more or less obligated to say &#39;Fine&#39; or whatever? Well, in 
Lavender Town, if someone asks you, they actually want to know! They&#39;re 
not expecting you to lie to them. If I say to someone &#39;How are you 
doing?&#39; you&#39;re perfectly within their rights to say &#39;Oh, I sprained my 
ankle and it really hurts&#39;, or &#39;oh, I got food poisoning at the Yin Tze 
again&#39;, or whatever, and no one will be offended. Everywhere else I&#39;ve 
been, though, it&#39;s like you&#39;ve just slapped them in the face if you tell 
them honestly how you&#39;re doing!&quot;

Erika waited patiently for the courier to finish her little rant before 
speaking in a quiet tone that was in contrast to the way the girl had 
begun to raise her voice. &quot;So, Miranda,&quot; she inquired softly, her 
emerald eyes seeming all knowing as the girl stared back at the Gym 
Leader in sudden surprise, &quot;How are you doing?&quot;

&quot;I- I,&quot; Miranda stammered, her voice breaking as hot tears spilled from 
her eyes. &quot;It hurts,&quot; she confessed, leaning closer as Erika released 
the courier&#39;s hand and opened her arms invitingly.

&quot;I know,&quot; the woman whispered, her arms going about Miranda as the girl 
leaned against her, &quot;Sometimes fate can be cruel, but you can&#39;t allow 
sadness and pain to rule your life.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; Miranda inquired sardonically, holding Erika tightly and 
crying into the silk that covered the woman&#39;s shoulder as she felt 
Erika&#39;s fingers run through the dark tangles of her hair, &quot;My Father was 
killed along with all his dreams, my Mother&#39;s remarried to some guy from 
Maiden&#39;s Peak she barely knows, and the man I loved dumped me when he 
found out my family wasn&#39;t wealthy! Misery&#39;s already forced me to leave 
the place I grew up in and leave behind almost everything I&#39;ve ever 
loved... Why stop now?&quot;

Erika held the girl a little tighter as Miranda shook in her arms, 
simply letting the courier cry for a time as the Gym Leader pondered the 
problem. &quot;Because, dear, your life doesn&#39;t always be this way,&quot; she 
explained in a quiet, nonjudgmental tone, &quot;Fate is just a guide line, 
but every person that lives and breaths has freedom of choice. And if 
you choose to try to and get through this, then you can alter your 
destiny. You don&#39;t have to harbor this bitterness if all it does is 
cause you pain.&quot;

&quot;But I chose to be with Derrick,&quot; Miranda countered, her fingers 
clenching and bunching up twin handfuls of Erika&#39;s kimono, &quot;I chose to- 
to...&quot;

&quot;Shhh,&quot; Erika whispered softly, ignoring the fact that her fingers had 
become hopelessly entangled in the girl&#39;s hair, &quot;I know, dear. When 
we&#39;re in love, we do things we might not normally do, and sometimes we 
make mistakes. But it&#39;s better to learn from them that dwell upon them.&quot;

&quot;I just can&#39;t believe anyone could be that deceitful,&quot; Miranda muttered 
through clenched teeth, lifting her head to face Erika, &quot;I mean, what 
sort of monster tells a girl he loves her when in reality the only thing 
he loves is money?&quot; 

Erika wiped away the courier&#39;s tears, her concerned expression deepening 
at the sight of Miranda&#39;s red-rimmed eyes. &quot;Not all monsters are the 
slavering beasts that stalk the night,&quot; she quoted, &quot;some dwell in the 
light, and other walk the earth in human guise.&quot;

Miranda sighed heavily, shaking her head in dismay. &quot;There is no real 
answer, is there?&quot;

&quot;As much as I pride myself as being a student of human nature,&quot; 
confessed Erika sadly, &quot;I&#39;m afraid that not even I have puzzled out how 
it is that greed can drive us to use love as a weapon. I&#39;m sorry, deary, 
but sometimes you just have to accept and move on. For if you dwell upon 
this for too long, then he&#39;ll have won.&quot;

&quot;Forgive and forget then?&quot; Miranda inquired with a bitter smirk and a 
slight annoyance to her tone.

&quot;No,&quot; Erika replied in a seriously, shaking her head slowly as she 
spoke, &quot;Forgiveness can only be given to those who sincerely seek it. I 
simply believe that there&#39;s no reason to allow his callousness to cause 
you any more problems than it already has.&quot;

Miranda smiled weakly. &quot;You&#39;re more than just a para-horticulturalist, 
aren&#39;t you?&quot; she inquired with a hint of amusement.

&quot;I&#39;m not psychic if that is what you imply, miss,&quot; said Erika 
mysteriously, her smile all knowingly enigmatic, &quot;I am simply a student 
of human nature. A trait I try to pass on to all whom I teach here.&quot;

&quot;And this is more than just a Gym, isn&#39;t it?&quot; the courier inquired 
rhetorically, her arms slipping away as for the first time she noticed 
the intense softness of the garment Erika wore.

&quot;Indeed,&quot; the woman agreed with a nod and a small smile as she closed 
her eyes thoughtfully, &quot;I follow in the footsteps of my grandMother who 
felt that the world had grown cold, dark and alone. She felt that people 
were loosing their compassionate natures and were beginning to see 
nature as a tool. One that needed to be controlled as opposed to worked 
with. So, when she founded her Gym my grandMother also decided to teach 
her philosophy to any whom would listen. Although many came to her for 
horticultural advice, many left with a deeper understanding of the world 
around them. It&#39;s my grandMother, actually, who is responsible for 
Celadon being what it is today. A beautiful garden where humans exist in 
harmony with nature, as opposed to say Saffron...&quot;

Miranda smiled, catching the hint of bitterness in Erika&#39;s tone. &quot;Or 
Gringy,&quot; she added lightly, causing the woman to shuddered visibly. 

&quot;A necessary evil, though, I suppose,&quot; the Gym Leader explained 
carefully, &quot;In some ways, it&#39;s almost better to keep all of our major 
manufacturing and chemical producing facilities in one place. And being 
so isolated high in the mountains like that its environmental impact 
isn&#39;t as great.&quot;

&quot;And don&#39;t forget,&quot; the courier added, her mood shifting for the better 
as the subject changed, &quot;that with things like grimers popping up now 
and then to feed off the waste Gringy City produces the pollution 
problem&#39;s mostly cleared up, right?&quot;

Erika made a face that was part smile, part grimace. &quot;Nature in its 
infinite wisdom may have created creatures to deal with our messes,&quot; she 
agreed with a slight shudder, &quot;but I fear that I still find toxic 
pokemon quite repulsive.&quot;

Miranda smiled, glancing about the arboretum curiously. &quot;I have noticed 
that you prefer to surround yourself with beauty,&quot; she replied 
wistfully.

&quot;I must confess to having an eye for the aesthetic,&quot; Erika agreed, 
retrieving a pokeball from a hidden pocket within the folds of her 
kimono, &quot;That&#39;s part of the reason I&#39;ve been looking forward to evolving 
Triffid.&quot;

&quot;I have to admit that weepinbels do look a little silly,&quot; Miranda 
chuckled quietly, reaching into her backpack to retrieve the small 
rectangular and rather heavy package she had come to deliver, &quot;No 
offence.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t think so,&quot; assured Erika with a warm smile as she aimed 
the orb away from herself and very carefully pressed the activation 
button, &quot;You&#39;re not the type to insult someone for no reason.&quot;

As the crimson glow materialized into a large, well cared for creature 
that resembled a pitcher plant, Miranda handed its owner the small 
package. &quot;I&#39;ve never been big on insults,&quot; she confessed, &quot;I tend to 
leave the taunting to Nezumi.&quot;

Erika laughed as the large sentient carnivorous plant bounded into her 
outstretched arms and wrapped four long green tendrils around the woman 
happily. &quot;Well,&quot; came the Gym Leader&#39;s amused tone over the curious 
sounds of the happy plant, &quot;since you&#39;re meeting my Triffid, perhaps I 
should meet this Nezumi of yours.&quot;

&quot;Um, are you, like... Okay with rodents?&quot; the courier inquired 
carefully, digging through her backpack and quickly finding the two 
pokeballs she carried.

&quot;I&#39;ve done my time in laboratories,&quot; the woman chuckled, her smile 
fading slightly as she glanced at Miranda thoughtfully, &quot;And I also 
raise several carnivorous plants. I hope that doesn&#39;t bother you.&quot;

Miranda shook her head as she aimed white and purple ball into her 
waiting left hand. &quot;I&#39;ve long since dealt with the fact that rattatas 
are food to a lot of predators,&quot; she assured, &quot;But just because I 
wouldn&#39;t eat one doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to go around stopping their 
natural predators from keeping their numbers down. After all, they breed 
like crazy!&quot; 

With that, the courier hit the activation switch and the ball clicked 
open, expelling its small cargo into Miranda&#39;s waiting hand. A moment 
later, the small purple and white rodent that materialized there looked 
up at the girl with a look of sudden alarm. But as he sniffed the air 
between them, Nezumi&#39;s expression slowly became one of amusement.

&quot;What is it?&quot; Miranda inquired as a wide grin spread across the 
rattata&#39;s face, and a small chuckling sound from deep in his throat 
slowly grew into laughter.

&quot;Something wrong?&quot; Erika inquired, carefully unwrapping the package as 
Triffid leaned against her, the plant&#39;s tendrils continually poking 
curiously at the plain brown paper it was wrapped in.

&quot;I, um-&quot; Miranda stammered as Nezumi&#39;s laughter became more hysterical, 
the small rodent now clutching his stomach before rolling off the 
courier&#39;s hand and landing in her lap before continuing down the ramp 
formed by her calves to the ground.

&quot;He must find your current appearance amusing for some reason,&quot; the 
woman inferred as Miranda glanced down at herself with a suddenly 
distressed expression and the weepinbell gave Nezumi a hungry look.

&quot;Oh, oh yeah. I forgot,&quot; Miranda replied as Erika gave the plant a 
warning glace to keep her from trying to eat the rattata. &quot;Oh that&#39;s 
enough already!&quot; the girl grumbled with a smirk, reaching down to grab 
up Nezumi as he held his stomach and gave short chuckles between gasps 
for air whenever he caught a glimpse of what Miranda was wearing.

&quot;He&#39;s not used to seeing you dressed this way,&quot; said Erika with an 
amused smile, the brown wrapper falling away from the thin layer of 
protective bubble wrap that held the heavy, specially carved stone.

&quot;No, not really,&quot; admitted Miranda in dismay as she held Nezumi close to 
her face and brushed her cheek against him affectionately, &quot;To be 
honest, it was a fight just trying to get me into a dress when my Mother 
married Bob. I guess I&#39;m just something of a tomboy.&quot;

&quot;I could tell,&quot; Erika replied with a happy smile, her emerald eyes 
glancing at the courier for a brief moment before her face literally lit 
up with the pale green glow that emanated from the flat stone she held.

&quot;They probably wouldn&#39;t be as expensive if the people down in Stone Town 
didn&#39;t feel the need to make them so ornate looking,&quot; Miranda commented, 
leaning in closer to view the delicately carved leaf pattern upon the 
flat, polished to smoothness surface of the rock.

&quot;I don&#39;t mind,&quot; assured Erika, standing up as Triffid&#39;s tendrils flailed 
happily, reaching for the object as the woman rose and stepped out a 
short distance, &quot;It will however make a pleasant souvenir of this 
moment.

Erika glanced over her shoulder, smiling down at the happily bouncing 
plant before stepping in a slow half circle and setting the stone down 
upon the grass. &quot;And speaking of souvenirs,&quot; the woman added as Triffid 
stood her ground, making excited noises, desperate for the moment when 
her mistress would give permission to touch the stone, &quot;Perhaps you&#39;d 
like one of your visit to my Gym?&quot;

Miranda looked up from the weepinbell with a surprised expression that 
became an amused smile. &quot;No, no,&quot; she assured, shaking her head 
dismissively, &quot;As I&#39;ve said. I&#39;m just a courier. I&#39;m not the type to 
challenge Gym Leaders.&quot;

Erika tilted her head thoughtfully. &quot;I&#39;d be good for you, though, I 
think,&quot; she pondered as Nezumi glanced up at Miranda and nodded 
vigorously in agreement, &quot;A little adrenaline to chase away your 
troubles, not to mention the exercise you&#39;ll be giving your pokemon, or 
the self-esteem you&#39;d gain for defeated me.&quot;

Miranda laughed at the thought. &quot;As if!&quot; she counted with amusement, &quot;I 
really don&#39;t have much experience in these matters, so I&#39;m afraid it&#39;d 
be rather one sided.&quot;

The woman shrugged. &quot;Anything can happen, deary,&quot; she explained 
wistfully, holding Miranda&#39;s gaze for a long moment before continuing, 
&quot;and besides, you may hide it admirably, but your sense of self-worth is 
dwindling. That&#39;s something I always try to fix with those who come to 
my Gym. I simply cannot stand to allow someone to go through life 
without realizing their own potential.&quot;

The courier nodded, bowing her head warily and looking down at Nezumi. 
&quot;So, how do you want to do this?&quot; she inquired, smiling slightly at the 
excited gleam in Nezumi&#39;s eyes, the rodent&#39;s small body shaking with 
adrenaline at the thought of proving himself to her.

&quot;You said you have a dratini?&quot; Erika inquired, yet her tone was more of 
a statement.

&quot;Her name&#39;s Umi,&quot; Miranda explained a little reminiscently.

&quot;Then perhaps a little two on two?&quot; the Gym Leader suggested, producing 
a second ball and activating it beside Triffid.

Miranda glanced up and tried to keep from chuckling at the small, dark 
creature that materialized a short distance away. She could almost make 
out the small, beady little protuberances that aloud the odd plant to 
interpret light patterns into a form of sight. And the way to wobbled on 
a pair of short, stubby objects that could almost be called legs caused 
the long, pointed leaves that sprouted from its top to sway continually, 
made the courier want to laugh.

&quot;Oddish?&quot; the nearly uniformly black plant inquired curiously.

&quot;That&#39;s for sure,&quot; muttered Miranda under her breath, making Nezumi 
laugh as the girl reached into her backpack and retrieved a blue and 
white ball. &quot;So, what&#39;s this one&#39;s name?&quot; the courier inquired as Erika 
picked up the oddish in both hands, smiling happily as she held it close 
to her cheek affectionately.

&quot;Her name&#39;s Audrey,&quot; Erika said simply as the plant nuzzled against her 
happily, &quot;A rather recent acquisition, I must admit.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s um, cute,&quot; Miranda replied, giving the pair a disconcerting look 
as she activated the ball, causing Nezumi to leap down onto the lawn to 
greet his friend.

&quot;I&#39;ll admit that they&#39;re peculiar,&quot; the Gym Leader explained, smiling as 
the small, blue and white serpent appeared at Miranda&#39;s feet and yawned 
widely, showing off her rows of needle-like, razor sharp teeth before 
suddenly having a happy rattata leaping atop her head, causing the 
little dragon make a startled sound and bound into Miranda&#39;s lap, &quot;but 
their pollen can be mixed with other secret ingredients to produce a 
very pleasant scent. Also, my grandMother had one, so I thought it would 
be appropriate.&quot;

Miranda nodded, smiling as she gave Umi&#39;s eye ridges an affectionate 
scratch before setting both creatures down and walking toward Erika. &quot;I 
guess we all have our own reasons for the bringing them into our lives,&quot; 
she remarked, indicating the small group of assembled pokemon, &quot;but 
frankly, I just like their companionship. Unconditional love is hard to 
come by, and not something to be taken for granted.&quot;

&quot;Especially by those trainers who seem obsessed with collecting one 
each?&quot; Erika inquired in a more serious tone, meeting the courier gaze 
before glancing down at the pensive Triffid.

&quot;No offence to any trainers you may have as friends,&quot; the girl explained 
as Erika nodded to the plant, &quot;It&#39;s just that I just don&#39;t get the 
&#39;gotta catch &#39;em all&#39; mentality. I mean, what would you do with that 
many pokemon?!&quot;

Erika shook her head in helpless dismay, her attention focused upon the 
suddenly ecstatic weepinbell that all but pounced on the evolution stone 
between them. With a high-pitched squealing sound, and the excited 
flailing of her tendrils, Triffid snatched up the object and held it 
close to her body. 

&quot;Here we go,&quot; whispered Erika reverently, the sudden white glow from her 
pokemon casting odd shadows upon her delicately featured face as 
Audrey&#39;s form began to twist and reshape itself, growing larger and 
sprouting another pair of tendrils.

As the plant upgraded, Miranda and both her pokemon tilted their heads 
to one side, trying for a moment to discern why the plant&#39;s mouth was 
moving from the bottom to the top of her body. &quot;You sure you&#39;re ready 
for this?&quot; the courier inquired, glancing at Nezumi as the light faded 
and the rattata grinned with a nod of reply.

&quot;All done,&quot; chimed in Erika happily, holding out her arms as the 
suddenly significantly larger and much more menacing looking Triffid 
moved to thank her, &quot;Feel any different dear?&quot;

Triffid let out a shrill sound of confirmation and glanced back at 
Nezumi hungrily. &quot;He ain&#39;t on the menu, lady,&quot; Miranda told the newly 
evolved victreebel, her eyes narrowing as the sharp thorns around the 
plant&#39;s maw bristled in anticipation.

&quot;You can eat afterwards,&quot; Erika told Triffid, taking the plant by one of 
her tendrils and leading her towards the center of the Gym, &quot;but right 
now we have a Challenge to do.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re sure about this, right?&quot; inquired Miranda, scooping up both her 
pokemon and hurrying after her hostess.

Nezumi nodded confidently, giving a dismissive wave of his paw as Umi 
wrapped herself about Miranda&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Tatta, ra,&quot; he assured, 
making the courier smile slightly.

&quot;Just don&#39;t do anything silly like leap down her throat and try to tear 
out her tongue or anything,&quot; the girl cautioned with a smirk.

Nezumi gave a short laugh, meeting Audrey&#39;s ravenous gaze with a 
confident grin as they approached. &quot;Any time you&#39;re ready,&quot; called Erika 
from her place at the other end of the field, her voice calm, her eyes 
distant, calculating.

Miranda nodded, stepping into the square at her end shaking her head 
warily. &quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m doing this,&quot; she muttered to herself as 
Nezumi leapt off her shoulder and reared up on his hind legs, chittering 
insults back at his opponent...

***

&quot;Hey yo, Greek Salad!&quot; the rattata laughed shifting from foot to foot as 
he tried to remain standing in the unaccustomed position and patted his 
stomach, &quot;I hope ya&#39;all don&#39;t mind if I don&#39;t use any dressing when I 
eat ya. I&#39;m on a diet, eh!&quot;

&quot;Your taunts speak of the desperation of one whose many cousins have 
fallen victim to my hunger,&quot; the carnivorous plant hissed back as the 
battle began, &quot;But we shall see if your bravado is justified!&quot;

Nezumi smirked as Miranda gave him the signal to attack, and all six of 
Audrey&#39;s tendrils reared up like the claws of a mantis in response to 
Nezumi&#39;s fangs suddenly glowing as the rattata charged forward...

***

&quot;Don&#39;t let him get in too close, dear,&quot; cautioned Erika, her tone calm, 
barely watching the battle as she carefully sat down up the grass and 
linked her fingers together thoughtfully, &quot;Razor leaf should suffice.&quot;

At the other end of the field, however, Miranda stood tensely with her 
fists clenched, her heart racing as Triffid&#39;s large, deep green leaves 
bristled in response to Nezumi&#39;s approach. &quot;Be careful!&quot; she called out, 
her voice catching in her throat as Umi&#39;s coiling body squeezed her 
chest just a little too tightly as the nervously watching dratini&#39;s eyes 
blazed with orange light.

On the field, Nezumi merely snickered at Miranda&#39;s warning, easily 
leaping from side to side as a barrage of spinning green objects whizzed 
past him, some so close he could hear them cutting mercilessly through 
the air.

&quot;He makes for a small target at a distance,&quot; commented Erika, idly 
petting Audrey&#39;s leaves as they both watched Nezumi leap up over the 
last of the flying objects and sail towards Audrey&#39;s waiting tendrils, 
one of which stabbed menacing down towards him, &quot;but up close he may be 
at a disadvantage.&quot;

&quot;Now Nezumi!&quot; Miranda called out as the sharp end of the tendril came 
down, &quot;Lock Jaw!&quot;

The rattata grinned broadly, twisting in the air as the tendril brushed 
past his fur before Nezumi&#39;s oddly glowing incisors bit down hard 
against Triffid&#39;s tendril even as she sent the others in to nab him.

In response to the sudden pain, the plant shrieked, flailing her tendril 
in the air, spinning Nezumi and around several times before smashing him 
against the grassy field. &quot;Nezumi! Hang on!&quot; Miranda called out, 
struggling with shaking fingers to find Nezumi&#39;s pokeball as the dazed 
rattata let go and rolled away from the victreebel.

&quot;Is he okay to continue?&quot; Erika inquired, tilting her head curiously to 
one side as Nezumi staggered to one side, his eyes crossed and unfocused 
as the rattata struggled just to stand.

&quot;No,&quot; said Miranda worriedly, aiming the beam of red light from the 
purple and white ball at Nezumi, &quot;He&#39;s had enough.&quot;

Erika nodded as Nezumi dematerialized and Umi slithered from Miranda&#39;s 
shoulders. &quot;If it&#39;s any consolation,&quot; the Gym Leader offered as the 
little dragon hissed menacingly at the plant, &quot;he shows a lot of 
promise.&quot;

Miranda smiled, blushing a little at the compliment, yet still concerned 
about Nezumi. &quot;Thanks,&quot; she replied as Umi raced off across the field 
without prompting, &quot;but this isn&#39;t over yet!&quot;

A satisfied smile crossed Erika&#39;s lips as Umi reared up like an angry 
serpent and Triffid turned her attention to the dragon. &quot;Good,&quot; the 
woman chuckled before lifting her index finger and pointing simply in 
Umi&#39;s direction, &quot;Triffid, entangle!&quot;

The victreebel responded with a shrill sound, all six of her tendrils 
reaching out to wrap around Umi as the dratini inhaled deeply before 
spitting out a small ball of flame in Triffid&#39;s direction and quickly 
slithering off.

As the sharply pointed tendrils arced through the air, converging in a 
tangled mess that hit nothing, the small ball of flame spiraled towards 
their source. &quot;It would be best for you to evade, dear,&quot; commented 
Erika, her expression becoming concerned. The woman refused to raise her 
voice, however, even as Triffid shrieked, taking the blast of suddenly 
exploding flame right where her tendrils sprouted from.

&quot;Ouch,&quot; Miranda commented as they plant&#39;s limbs squirmed angrily, 
retracting as the dragon&#39;s flame caught, causing Triffid&#39;s body to 
smolder, &quot;Um, anyway, Umi! Constrict and hold!&quot;

A heartbeat later, and Umi was upon Triffid. The dratini quickly 
wrapping her long, sleek body around the plant, barely reaching all the 
way around as she squeezed for all she was worth. For her part, the 
victreebel growled, unfettered by concerns like squished lungs as her 
now shortened tendrils sprouted long, sharp, dark thorns. 

&quot;Crud!&quot; Miranda cursed, recognizing the technique and jumping a little 
as she called out to Umi, &quot;Blast the vines! Don&#39;t let her drain you!&quot;

Umi pried open one of her now glowing red multifaceted eyes and growled 
in frustration, still gritting her teeth as she strained to strangle the 
plant. As the half-dozen spines came racing towards her, a small smile 
crossed the dragon&#39;s lips, her eyes gleaming suddenly golden as the 
tendrils converged and stuck.

Erika gave a small, quite exclamation of surprise, muffled by Miranda&#39;s 
suddenly laugh of joy as Umi simply let go, causing herself to be thrown 
off the victreebel as Triffid stabbed herself mostly harmlessly with her 
own thorns.

&quot;Now, Umi!&quot; Miranda called out excitedly, &quot;Take her down with another 
blast of flame!&quot;

The dratini grinned broadly as the inside of her mouth illuminated, and 
spit out another fist-sized ball of flame that exploded upon on impact 
against Triffid&#39;s side. As the plant yanked her tendrils free, she 
shrieked in surprise and tripped over herself as Umi&#39;s flames caught and 
refused to die.

&quot;I think that&#39;ll do for now,&quot; came Erika&#39;s calm yet concerned voice as 
the victreebel suddenly dematerialized and vanished in a fading beam of 
red light.

&quot;Oh, sorry about that,&quot; Miranda replied, feeling a little embarrassed as 
the oddish in Erika&#39;s lap leapt up and scurried forward to take 
Triffid&#39;s place.

Erika chuckled, her smile amused as she shook her head slightly. &quot;You&#39;re 
reactions are as I expected,&quot; the woman replied lightly, unconcerned now 
that her pokemon was out of danger, &quot;And my dear Triffid will be just 
fine.&quot;

The courier nodded, smirking and tilting her head curiously as Audrey 
waddled up to Umi who was also staring down at the oddish with mild 
amusement. &quot;Besides,&quot; chuckled Erika with a strange gleam in her eye, 
&quot;this isn&#39;t over yet. Triffid, be a dear show our guest what I mean.&quot;

Umi glanced up at the woman and made a curious noise as the oddish made 
happy chuckling sounds, hopping happily over before waving her leaves 
under the dragon&#39;s nose. &quot;What&#39;s she-?&quot; Miranda began, realizing too 
late as Umi blinked loudly, her head swaying woozily as the dratini 
inhaled the oddish&#39;s pollen.

&quot;Oh...&quot; the courier finished, her hands dropping to her sides as Umi 
slumped to the ground and began snoring loudly, &quot;I didn&#39;t anticipate 
that.&quot;

&quot;It happens,&quot; said Erika with a shrug, rising to her feet as the strange 
little plant danced merrily around the slumbering dragon, &quot;and you can&#39;t 
be expected to win the first time you go up against one of us.&quot;

Miranda nodded, walking out towards Umi as Erika knelt before her and 
gently ran her hand over the length of the snoozing pokemon&#39;s body. 
&quot;Strange,&quot; the woman commented contemplatively, smiling as Umi&#39;s upper 
half rose and fell in time with her breathing, &quot;I&#39;d have thought they 
were scaly. But I guess they aren&#39;t reptiles, are they?&quot; 

&quot;No,&quot; the courier said a little sadly, kneeling down before Erika and 
extending her hand to scratch Umi&#39;s eye ridges, and causing a pale, 
nearly imperceptible greenish glow to emit faintly from beneath her 
eyelids, &quot;they&#39;re kinda in their own um... Order?&quot;

&quot;Class, actually,&quot; chuckled Erika, looking up to meet Miranda&#39;s suddenly 
surprised glaze, smiling as the girl blushed and glanced away, &quot;Sorry 
dear, I am a bit of a scientist after all.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; whispered Miranda quietly, tensing as she felt Erika&#39;s fingers 
touch her own, their warmth sliding past as the woman moved her 
fingertips along Umi&#39;s eye ridges.

&quot;Like this?&quot; Erika inquired softly, causing Miranda to glance back, 
catching her smile.

&quot;Um, a bit more like this,&quot; the courier stammered watching as she slowly 
moved her fingertips along, &quot;just brush her gently with your nails. It&#39;s 
a sensitive spot for dragons. It&#39;s like a canine with the base of their 
tails.&quot;

Miranda met Erika&#39;s gaze again, smiling as the woman&#39;s fingers traced a 
line down Umi&#39;s slumbering form and scratched the base of her spine 
experimentally. &quot;She&#39;s not a growlithe,&quot; the courier chuckled, looking 
into the seemingly endless depths of Erika&#39;s emerald eyes.

&quot;I know,&quot; she replied, drawing her hand away and rising to her feet as 
Miranda&#39;s heartbeat slowly returned to normal, &quot;I was just being silly. 
Now then, if you&#39;d like I could have a room prepared for you. The rain 
seems to have no intention of letting up, and its almost meal time.&quot;

The courier glanced up at the huge dome above their heads, for the first 
time noticing the uniformly dark gray of the sky and the continuous 
splattering of the heavy raindrops, which quickly turned into rivulets 
of water as they spilt swiftly over the expanse of the glass dome.

&quot;Th-thanks,&quot; she replied, feeling a little overwhelmed and mildly 
confused.

Erika&#39;s gentle laughter was reassuring as Miranda carefully scooped up 
Umi. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, we have more than ample accommodations,&quot; the Gym 
Leader explained, and I could never forgive myself for sending you out 
in that storm again.&quot;

Miranda shook her head in dismay, feeling no desire to argue as she 
followed her hostess back out of the arboretum, thankful, but 
half-wondering when she&#39;d get her normal clothing back...
