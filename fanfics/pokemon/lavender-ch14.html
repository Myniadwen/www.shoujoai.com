He stood leaning against the wooden guardrail over looking the ocean, the wind 
off the water blowing his light brown, but graying hair into his eyes as the 
common sea birds fought with a spearow over a few fish that had washed up dead 
on the shore many meters below.

&quot;You wanted to talk to me?&quot; came the cautious sound of his stepdaughter&#39;s voice 
over the gentle crashing of the waves and the squawking of mundane gulls.

&quot;Sorta,&quot; he responded, turning to meet her suspicious gaze with a reassuring 
smile, &quot;You&#39;re mother wanted me to talk to you, actually.&quot;

Miranda nodded. Saying nothing as she stepped up beside Bob and leaned against 
the railing. &quot;It&#39;s about Aunt Laurna&#39;s offer. Isn&#39;t it?&quot; her voice seemed 
distant, her stormy gray eyes focused on something far out to sea.

Bob nodded as he turned back to the ocean. &quot;You know, Vivian misses you a lot,&quot; 
he said, tossing a loose stone at the hovering flock of angry birds as their 
smaller cousin seemed to laugh at them from below.

&quot;I am quite well aware of that, Robert,&quot; said Miranda dully, turning slightly to 
face him before continuing, &quot;And the answer&#39;s the same one that I give every 
year.&quot;

&quot;Miri, look-&quot; began Bob, holding out his hand to touch her shoulder.

&quot;Don&#39;t!&quot; she yelled angrily, roughly knocking his hand away and glaring at her 
stepfather, &quot;Don&#39;t touch me, and don&#39;t you dare and try to tell me what I should 
do with my life! And don&#39;t you EVER dare call me that again! You&#39;re not-! You&#39;re 
not...&quot;

&quot;Your Father,&quot; Bob finished, his hands dropping limply to his sides, &quot;I know, 
Miranda. I&#39;ve never tried to replace Nicholas, not with Vivian, and not with 
you. And I&#39;ve never expected you to call me dad, either. Now then, I&#39;m not 
telling you this as a parent, I&#39;m asking you this as a friend. For your mother&#39;s 
sake.&quot;

Miranda threw her hands down onto the wooden railing, gripping it so tightly 
that her knuckles immediately turned white. &quot;I, I have my reasons for not 
staying,&quot; she managed, pushing down her misplaced anger, &quot;You know that, and so 
does Mother. But I do what I can for her. I show up every year for the Festival, 
and I keep in touch whenever I can. It&#39;s just that... That this place... It...&quot;

&quot;Everything here reminds you of him,&quot; said Bob with a nod, watching as the 
triumphant spearow flew off with the remains of a fish in each of his talons, 
the gulls diving and squabbling amongst each other to snatch what remained, &quot;And 
now you have Misty. Someone you love, and someone you want to stay with.&quot;

Miranda nodded. &quot;Yes,&quot; she replied quietly, unable to deny either truth as tears 
welled up in her eyes, &quot;Even though mom&#39;s tried to change things for me, I can 
still hear his voice. I can still feel his kiss upon my forehead wishing me 
goodnight when I go to sleep in my old bed. And I can see his refection in Umi&#39;s 
eyes.&quot;

His stepdaughter pushed her glasses up as she rubbed the tears away. &quot;And as for 
Misty,&quot; the courier continued, &quot;I just can&#39;t bear the thought of abandoning her. 
Especially when it was me who put this idea in her head. She wants to challenge 
the League, you know. Misty wants to prove that she&#39;s just as good, if not 
better than that selfish, oblivious moron she used to believe actually might 
love her.&quot;

&quot;And you want to show her your support, your loyalty, your love,&quot; inferred Bob 
with an understanding, though sad paternal smile, &quot;You don&#39;t want to abandon her 
the way you felt abandoned that day the Rockets came.&quot;

Miranda glanced at him darkly, but tears overwhelmed any comment she could make.  

&quot;Shh, it&#39;s alright,&quot; her stepfather said soothing, holding out his arms but not 
moving to hold her, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t have said that. I had no right...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; sobbed Miranda, stepping into his arms and accepting the embrace, &quot;It&#39;s 
true. I do feel as thought my Father abandoned me, and I feel so unspeakably 
guilty for blaming him. Maybe... maybe one day when I finally catch up to Kathy 
and find avenge his death, maybe then I&#39;ll be one step closer to settling down. 
I&#39;d even consider Aunt Laurna&#39;s offer then.&quot;

&quot;Revenge is a dangerous road, Miranda,&quot; Bob replied carefully, &quot;Just be careful 
you don&#39;t become what you hate most.&quot;

Miranda nodded, her head against her stepfather&#39;s shoulder as he held her. &quot;I 
know, Bob,&quot; she told him, ignoring the tears that blurred her already imperfect 
vision, &quot;I&#39;m not saying I&#39;d kill her. I don&#39;t think Misty would ever forgive me 
for going that far...&quot;

Bob smiled, barely suppressing a small chuckle. &quot;Then this girl&#39;s good for you,&quot; 
he said, beaming with approval, &quot;She&#39;s changed ya, kid. Misty&#39;s made you a 
better person.&quot;

Miranda smiled in spite of herself. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she agreed with a smirk she couldn&#39;t 
hold in, laughing a little despite her tears, &quot;A year ago I wanted to see 
Katherine Forester&#39;s head on a plate. But now, now I&#39;d just be happy to see her 
rotting away in Gringy Prison for the next hundred years!&quot;

Bob laughed, giving his stepdaughter an affectionate hug. &quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; he said, 
feeling somewhat relieved, &quot;And your mother will be too. You know, before you 
met Misty you had us worried, eh?&quot;

Miranda pulled away slightly so that she could look up at his smiling face. 
&quot;Really?&quot; she inquired in surprise, quickly reviewing her last few visits home.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Bob, his tone becoming serious, &quot;Your gloomy despondency was 
starting become problematic. I never said anything, but there were times when it 
interfered with your job. But irregardless, we were both really worried about 
you.&quot;

&quot;And now?&quot;

Bob smiled in the way he always did, chasing away any hint of the many years 
that had passed in his lifetime. &quot;Now I&#39;m sure your Mother won&#39;t mind you 
escorting Misty on her journey. I&#39;ll even see what I can do about sending you on 
extended trips to the Gym cities,&quot; he assured her before his voice became one of 
false warning, &quot;So long as this new hobby of yours doesn&#39;t interfere with your 
work schedule!&quot;

Miranda laughed, returning his embrace and giving him a kiss on the cheek. 
&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said as her stepfather blushed visibly, suddenly at a loss for 
words, &quot;Dad.&quot;

Bob&#39;s arms fell limply at his sides, completely dumbfounded as his stepdaughter 
slipped free of his arms with ease and ran back up the road, laughing joyously 
as she went...</pre>
