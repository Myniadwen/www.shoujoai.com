Hiroshi groans and looks like he wants to crawl under a rock and die. 
&quot;Do you have to keep saying that?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Imite asks, blinking. &quot;Girls?&quot; Hiroshi flinches. &quot;Girls? 
Girls, girls, girls!&quot;

Hiroshi covers his ears and looks like he wants the floor to swallow 
him or maybe the building to collapse. Satoshi slides his arms around 
his distressed boyfriend. &quot;But Hiro-chan, you&#39;d make a very *cute* 
girl,&quot; he murmurs, and I&#39;m close enough to hear it.

Suddenly, Hiroshi isn&#39;t nearly as annoyed.

&quot;And it&#39;s a good idea to butt your nose into someone else&#39;s business?&quot; 
Tooru asks Imite, who looks at him and flutters her lashes. He grins 
weakly. &quot;I must have forgotten who I was talking to...&quot;

Imite laughs. &quot;It&#39;s a good deed.&quot;

&quot;Natsume deserves it...&quot;

&quot;So does Erika!&quot;

Everyone turns to look at me, and I shrink back, waving my hand 
slightly. &quot;Uh...&quot;

&quot;Well then...&quot; Shigeru drawls. Kasumi hugs him tightly and kisses 
him...

It would be nice to be this happy with Natsume. And I&#39;d love that 
chance... Our friends are so happy. I&#39;m sure they have their problems, 
nothing is ever *perfect*. But... it would be nice to try... and see 
if we could reach perfection. Or as close as possible...

&quot;You have such a dreamy look on your face,&quot; Imite coos. &quot;You&#39;re 
thinking about Natsume.&quot; She states.

I blush, and smile. &quot;I am.&quot;

&quot;Then what are we waiting for?&quot; Kasumi asks.

&quot;Nothing!&quot; laughs Imite.

They say their good-byes, and then Imite pushes Hiroshi out towards 
the exit. &quot;You don&#39;t have to push me, you know,&quot; he says.

&quot;Yes I do,&quot; she laughs.

&quot;No you don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Yes I do.&quot;

&quot;No you don&#39;t...&quot;

Kasumi sighs. &quot;Right about now, Natsume&#39;s voice would be booming in 
your head and then you&#39;d definitely lose the argument,&quot; she murmurs 
wistfully. I blink.

&quot;I...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re going to be perfect for each other. Completely perfect... And 
we&#39;ll be there for support!&quot;

By the time we reach the car, Hiroshi is muttering about his manhood 
and Kasumi is snickering. &quot;If you&#39;re such a &#39;guy&#39;, then why are you 
here with us, hmm?&quot; she asks.

Hiroshi huffs and glares at her and goes to unlock the driver&#39;s side 
door. &quot;Someone needs to give you a ride and I doubt that the others 
would be so... sensitive.&quot;

Imite giggles. &quot;So, you&#39;re getting in touch with your feminine side?&quot; 
she asks.

Hiroshi blushes and Kasumi leans on the passenger side door. &quot;Imite, 
remember who you&#39;re talking to,&quot; she says.

Imite blinks. &quot;Eh?&quot;

&quot;Hiroshi. Who&#39;s dating... Satoshi. What does that say about him?&quot;

Imite blinks. &quot;Eh, he has good taste?&quot; she offers weakly.

&quot;No, silly. He&#39;s *gay*...&quot;

Imite blinks (do we see a pattern forming?) and then smiles. &quot;Oh! I 
get it. Of course. Hiroshi is gay.&quot; She then turns and looks across 
him at the car, as he opens the door and hits the unlock button. I 
open the door to get in behind him.

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t you already be in touch with your feminine side, 
Hiro-chan?&quot; she asks, and then slides in behind the passenger side 
seat.

Hiroshi fumes and slides in, and Kasumi&#39;s last in, closing the door.

&quot;Belt up,&quot; Hiroshi mutters, and turns on the car.

&quot;Aw, Hiroshi, don&#39;t be so pouty. We could have driven ourselves.&quot;

&quot;In this car?&quot; he asks, remotely amused. &quot;As if Satoshi would let 
*that* happen.&quot;

We start to drive out of the parking lot, and Imite giggles. &quot;You 
know, we should do more things like this. Ooh! I know. We could all 
get manicures and...&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Hiroshi shouts. &quot;No...&quot;

&quot;Oh come on don&#39;t you want to get pampered?&quot; Imite asks. &quot;I can tell 
you, it&#39;s certainly divine...&quot;

Hiroshi focuses his attention on driving. Imite huffs. &quot;You&#39;re no 
fun.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s just get to the gym before Natsume makes another mistake...&quot;

All I want to do is see her. The time passes by slowly. And it&#39;s not 
like Hiroshi it&#39;s driving fast enough... &quot;You should go faster,&quot; 
Kasumi says.

&quot;I have to go the limit,&quot; Hiroshi replies.

&quot;Hiroshi,&quot; Kasumi sighs. She swings her leg over the divider and slams 
it down onto the gas pedal -- and Hiroshi&#39;s foot. He cries out, and 
Kasumi grips the wheel so as to keep her balance.

&quot;You&#39;re going to kill us!&quot; he grits out.

&quot;It&#39;s all for a good reason, so it&#39;s okay!&quot;

&quot;What, death?!&quot;

Kasumi laughs.

At least one of us is as worried about this as me...

&quot;Hiroshi?&quot; Kasumi asks, the gym coming into sight.

&quot;What?&quot; he asks in a hiss.

&quot;I&#39;m going to take my foot off yours now. So. Hit. The. Breaks!&quot;

She sits back, and he does, the car skidding and hitting the curb. But 
we&#39;ve come to a stop... In the front view mirror, I see Hiroshi&#39;s eyes 
open slowly. &quot;Are we alive?&quot;

&quot;Yep!&quot; Imite chirps, getting out. &quot;Come on, come on!&quot;

Hiroshi sighs and turns off the ignition, and I unbuckle myself and 
crawl out of the back seat. I feel a bit shaken, and I look to the 
gym. &quot;Well, what are we waiting for?&quot; Imite seems to ask for the 
millionth time. Hiroshi gets out of the car, and checks it over.

Imite rolls her eyes. &quot;What are you doing?&quot;

&quot;Making sure we didn&#39;t hit anything,&quot; he sighs bleakly.

Imite giggles. &quot;You&#39;re being paranoid.&quot;

&quot;One of us should...&quot;

Kasumi shakes out her hair and starts up towards the gym. I follow 
after her, determined to see this through. &quot;Are you sure we should go 
in with her?&quot; I hear Hiroshi say behind me.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Imite replies. &quot;You&#39;re being paranoid again...&quot;

&quot;Well, I think someone needs to be,&quot; Hiroshi sighs.

Imite giggles, and Kasumi pushes open the front door. Biting her lip, 
she steps into the darkness partially.

&quot;Natsume?&quot; Kasumi calls out, and her voice echoes in the empty gym. 
&quot;Natsume, are you there?&quot; she looks for a light, but there&#39;s nothing. 
&quot;What could it hurt?&quot; she asks, and then, swallowing her fear, she 
walks completely into the gloom, and is then swallowed up.

&quot;Kasumi?&quot; Imite whispers. &quot;Kasu-chan?&quot; she blinks, and then follows 
after her. &quot;Into the darkness...&quot;

She too gets swallowed by the gloom.

I look to Hiroshi, and he holds out his hand. Smiling, I accept it, 
and we walk into the darkness together.

So why isn&#39;t it ending...? Oh. I open my eyes, and peer around the 
brightly lit room. &quot;Where are we?&quot; I ask. I can still feel Hiroshi&#39;s 
hand around mine... that at least is a comfort.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure. It looks like a little kids room... a girls,&quot; he says, 
and I nod. The toys, the dolls... everything is fresh and pristine. 
&quot;Kasumi and Imite have to be around here somewhere.&quot;

I nod, and step away from him, fingers sliding away. &quot;You&#39;re right. 
Now... if I were Imite or Kasumi, where would I be?&quot;

&quot;Uh...&quot;

I turn around at the sound of Hiroshi&#39;s voice. &quot;How about here?&quot; he 
asks, holding up two dolls who&#39;s appearances are hard to ignore.

&quot;Uh... it couldn&#39;t be,&quot; I murmur. &quot;Natsume! Natsume, please, I want to 
talk to you...&quot;

Hiroshi gasps, and I turn around. &quot;Natsume, please... give Erika a 
chance to talk. You could be surprised... in a good way.&quot;

I hear nothing and then *poof* Hiroshi&#39;s not there anymore. But the 
three dolls on the floor... I gather them up, and then look up at 
Natsume from where I&#39;m still kneeling on the floor. &quot;Natsume...&quot;

&quot;They don&#39;t understand. You don&#39;t understand, either,&quot; she whispers, 
closing her eyes, the light fading away.

&quot;Maybe I do... just give me a chance, please...&quot;

She shakes her head, hair unbound. &quot;You...&quot;

&quot;You won&#39;t let me talk,&quot; I say with force. Natsume&#39;s eyes flash open. 
&quot;Erika...&quot;

&quot;Why won&#39;t you? I&#39;m not going to hurt you. If you&#39;d just let me 
talk...&quot;

&quot;Of course you&#39;re going to hurt me! That&#39;s what... love does. It 
hurts. It makes you regret. It makes you someone else and takes your 
free will away. It... it&#39;s stupid and it&#39;s a mistake and...&quot;

&quot;Love might change you a lot, but it&#39;s not going to change you for 
anything but the good, Natsume. You need to feel... you need to take a 
chance.&quot;

She blinks, tears in her eyes. &quot;But I don&#39;t want to... I&#39;m afraid.&quot;

I set the little dolls down, and then walk to her. She&#39;s hovering 
right off the floor, and I hold my arms out, her eyes widening as I 
envelop her in my embrace.

&quot;Then you can be afraid with me... because you wouldn&#39;t be alone...&quot;

&quot;Erika...&quot; she whispers.

&quot;I love you, Natsume. Please don&#39;t leave me when I don&#39;t even know...&quot;

&quot;I... Erika...&quot; her arms slowly wind around me and she holds me for a 
moment. I hear the click of her heels as she sets down on the floor, 
and she holds me against her tightly. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry... I don&#39;t know 
what I&#39;m supposed to do. I...&quot;

She shifts her head, gloomy blue eyes focusing on my own. &quot;I&#39;m so 
sorry. I --...&quot;

Her voice trails off, muffled as I press my lips against hers. Her 
eyes widen, and I can feel the caress of her mind against my own, the 
taste of her lips and the push of a tongue against my own. So sweet, 
so perfect, so...

Natsume pulls away from me, a sad look on her face. &quot;You&#39;re too good 
for me... look at what I&#39;ve done. I let my emotions get out of hand... 
look what I did to them...&quot;

She closes her eyes and when she opens again, they&#39;re so radiant, so 
blue. &quot;Natsume...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll hurt you, like I hurt everything. I&#39;ll --&quot;

Smack!

Natsume touches her cheek and I stare at the red mark on her pale 
skin, wide-eyed. &quot;I -- I... I&#39;m sorry...&quot; I whisper.

She blinks, hand dropping away from her cheek, and then she speaks 
slowly, choosing her words carefully. &quot;Why did you do that?&quot; Natsume 
acts in a quiet voice.

&quot;B-because... you&#39;re not going to hurt me? -- I really don&#39;t know...&quot;

She blinks again, and takes a step back away from me. &quot;I...&quot;

&quot;Natsume, don&#39;t leave me, *please*... if there&#39;s a chance that 
something could happen between us, then I want to go for it...&quot;

&quot;Erika...&quot;

&quot;Please... listen to me...&quot;

Natsume shakes her head slowly. &quot;Erika...&quot;

&quot;Say something else!&quot; I plead.

I can see tears welling in her eyes, something she&#39;s not used to at 
all. &quot;Erika...&quot; she whispers. &quot;I don&#39;t know what to say...&quot;

&quot;T-then... make me *feel* it...&quot;

She blinks, and I tap my forehead. &quot;You can show me things that no 
words can describe... I know you can...&quot;

Natsume looks reluctant, and then her eyes glow, and I feel the gentle 
touch of something pressing against my mind. I can feel my eyes 
closing... but at the same time, it&#39;s like I can see a whole new 
world. And everything... everything is so clear and vibrant and I can 
*feel* it coursing through my veins...

And I can feel that she loves me. Though that isn&#39;t the word that the 
feeling radiates... it&#39;s a wholeness and it encompasses me completely. 
It makes me feel complete and I don&#39;t ever want to let it go.

I open my eyes again, and I&#39;m in her arms, bodies pressed together. 
&quot;We should thank them some time...&quot;

&quot;I should change them back...&quot; she replies, nervous and shaking.

&quot;We don&#39;t have to right away... no one will miss them.&quot; I smile and 
whisper and then we kiss, and that&#39;s all that matters.
