<p>The crescent moon shone brightly in   the dark night sky when Ash and Misty finally reached the docks. His   hand nervously letting go of the wheel, Ash switched off the car's ignition   and glanced out the window. There seemed to be a long figure standing   near the water's edge, completely alone. 'That must be her...' Ash thought,   deciding to classify this mysterious person as a woman due to her voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Are...are you sure we should   do this? You don't know what'll happen...&quot; Misty whispered into   Ash's ear, &quot;You didn't even bring a gun or any kind of weapon to   protect yourself...&quot; Her entire body was shivering.</p>
<p>Ash gave Misty a reassuring smile and   replied, &quot;Don't worry. I'll have everything under control, okay?   I promise I'll be safe...&quot; Kissing Misty once on the lips, Ash   swung open the car door and stepped out. Even though he tried to look   brave, his heart was pounding fast and he was covered in sweat. 'I...I   could really get myself killed here...'</p>
<p>The figure up ahead glanced over her   shoulder and hissed, &quot;...Ah. You made it. I was getting worried   you wouldn't come...&quot; Ash tried once again to think of who was   the owner of that voice, but he still came up empty.</p>
<p>Putting on a tough face, Ash smirked   and said, &quot;C'mon...who wouldn't say 'no' to come out to the docks   in the middle of the night to meet a killer who hates me for some reason?&quot;   His sarcasm didn't seem very well-appreciated.</p>
<p>After a few moments of silence, the   female figure finally asked, &quot;...Tell me, are you still confused   on my true identity?&quot; Before Ash could reply, though, the figure   stepped forward until she was close enough to be visible in the car's   headlights. Pulling down her hood, the figure revealed herself to be...</p>
<p>Kanata.</p>
<p>Ash's eyes widened in shock as a sudden   explosion of memories flowed through his mind. 'Kanata...that girl with   short purple hair and a Grumpig...she was a coordinator, just like May...'   Now, after so many years, her purple hair had grown past her shoulders   and her face was devoid of any innocence she once possessed long ago.</p>
<p>&quot;You're...Kanata, aren't you?&quot;   Ash asked, his mind still numb from shock. Misty, however, who had never   met Kanata, just continued to watch through the car window in complete   confusion. Smirking at Ash's expression, Kanata said, &quot;What's wrong?   Were you hoping for it to be...May?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? May? What...what are you   talking about?&quot; Ash was shocked enough to see that Paul's killer   was really Kanata, but why would he possibly think that it was May,   who was dead now? The purple-haired woman's reaction to Ash's question   was also quite shocking, too.</p>
<p>Kanata's face scrunched up in anger   and she screamed, &quot;You bastard! You heartless...bastard! How could   you have possibly forgotten about what happened between you and May?   Hell, how could you have forgotten that it's YOUR fault she's dead!   If you had just accepted her, she would still be alive right now! It's   your fault...it's your fault the girl I loved is dead!&quot;</p>
<p>'Kanata loved May, huh? Why am I not   surprised...?' For some reason, this sudden realization on Kanata's   part made Ash feel calmer. Clutching the sides of her head as if in   pain, Kanata continued to ramble about in her insanity. Ash just stood   there and listened in silence.</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck you! Fuck you and that stuck-up   whore in your car over there! You can all go to hell, do you hear? May...she   deserved better! How could she have fallen in love with you of all people?   You're nothing! You wouldn't be able to make May happy! Only I could   make May happy! Only me! We belonged together, but you had to go and   ruin everything! Why did you hurt her so, Ash Ketchum? Why?&quot;</p>
<p>Gulping down a huge wad of spit, Ash   replied, &quot;Kanata...I'm sorry, but I just couldn't bring myself   to love May. I didn't even want to TRY and love her. She came onto me   when me and Misty were almost an official couple, hoping that I would   fall for someone with a much curvier body, but...it's the person inside   that counts, Kanata. That's...that's why I couldn't love May...&quot;</p>
<p>This seemed to have pissed off Kanata   more than before. Pulling out her gun, she aimed the barrel directly   at Misty and screeched, &quot;IT'S YOUR FAULT! IT'S YOUR FAULT!&quot;   Realizing what was going to happen, Ash reached into his pocket, quickly   pulled out something silver, and aimed it right at Kanata's chest.</p>
<p>It was a pistol. A Browing 9-Millimeter   High Power Pistol, to be exact. The edges of the slender gun gleamed   in the moonlight. Misty's eyes widened in shock when she saw the weapon   in Ash's hands. 'He...he didn't tell me that he brought a gun!' the   orange-haired beauty thought nervously, hoping that Ash really wasn't   planning on shooting Kanata. At most, he could just scare her off...</p>
<p>&quot;If you don't put down your gun   in the next thirty seconds, Kanata...I'll shoot you dead!&quot;</p>
<p>Ash had never looked so serious about   anything in his life as he did right now. He was willing to do anything   to protect Misty...even kill someone. After a few seconds, Kanata smirked   and her gun slipped out of her grip. Ash let out a sigh of relief and   lowered his pistol to the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;You're impressive, Ash Ketchum.   Your love for Misty reminds me much of my feelings for May. Unfortunately...&quot;   As she continued talking, Kanata began to slowly walk backwards until   she was standing close to the edge of the dock. &quot;Unfortunately...unlike   me, you finally have the person you love, but...so will I, too...soon   enough...&quot;</p>
<p>Removing the robes she was wearing,   Kanata revealed she had several rectangle-shaped weights tied to her   body. Still smiling, Kanata took one more step back...and fell into   the water. Letting out a cry, Ash ran forward and looked down into the   pitch-black ocean before him. A few bubbles rose to the surface and   then...nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;...Is she...?&quot; Misty asked   with a quivering voice as she stepped out of the car and walked up next   to Ash, who was trembling. Ash nodded once before dropping onto his   knees and cry.</p>
<p>&quot;M-Maybe...maybe it was my fault...my   fault that May died...my fault that May had to go and kill all those   people, even her little brother Max...all my fault...&quot;</p>
<p>Misty wrapped a comforting arm around   Ash and whispered, &quot;No...it wasn't your fault. It wasn't your fault...&quot; <br />
</p>
<p>Even in the darkness, Zoey could make   out the mansion slowly coming into view. As she came closer and closer,   her car picking up speed, a evil smirk formed on Zoey's lips. Reaching   to the car seat beside her, she grabbed the handle of the pistol she   bought earlier that day. </p>
<p>The mansion she was driving to...was   the one place where she is judged completely and utterly on character   alone...</p>
<p>It was her home...it was her parents'   home. </p>
