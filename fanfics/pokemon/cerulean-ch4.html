<h1>Cerulean Dreams (part 4 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nikolai.html">Nikolai Mirovich</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/cerulean-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>The lights were out as the two moved through foyer, into the 
expansive, domed ceilinged area were people came to be entertained 
and to challenge for cascade badges. The room itself was quiet 
except for the gentle lapping of water against the edges of the 
Olympic sized swimming pool at the center, and the gentle hum from 
down the hall. This was also where a pale light that barely 
illuminated the calm water issued forth, marking the site of the 
enormous aquarium the gym held.

&quot;This place doesn&#39;t seem to have changed,&quot; commented Misty, her 
feet padding quietly along the waterproof tiled floor as she led 
Miranda by the hand through the quiet twilight.

&quot;Home never should,&quot; the courier mused, pushing up her glasses and 
rubbing her wary eyes, &quot;It should always be safe and comforting.&quot;

&quot;I wish,&quot; sighed Misty, leading Miranda towards the pale light, 
down a short hall, and into the long, circular corridor that 
surrounded the expansive aquarium, &quot;but at least I could come here 
to relax sometimes, when things were bad. I used to just stand her 
for hours watching the fish and water pokemon.&quot;

Miranda nodded, placing her hands upon her lover&#39;s shoulders and 
staring past their mutual reflection into the clear water. &quot;It&#39;s 
very nice,&quot; she agreed, looking out at the hundreds of lazily 
floating sea creatures who moved about the artificial reef, &quot;And 
your pokemon must like it.&quot;

&quot;They do,&quot; replied Misty, leaning back as she crossed her arms and 
laid her hands gently over Miranda&#39;s, &quot;Infact, I think that&#39;s my 
starmie over there.&quot;

Miranda stood a little taller to see past a large clump of seaweed 
that swayed in the artificial current. Once her eyes had adjusted 
to the dim lighting, she could just make out an odd shape half 
buried in the sand. A large red crystal that glowed with its own 
inner light, surrounded by a ten-pointed star resting quietly 
after a long day of doing whatever it was that starmie did in 
their spare time.

&quot;See your anything else anywhere?&quot; Miranda inquired, keeping her 
voice low as not to break the spell the quiet dimness seemed to 
cast over the area.

Misty shook her head, leaning forward and taking a few steps away 
from Miranda as she searched along the reef for any sign of her 
other pokemon. &quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;s in here somewhere,&quot; she replied in a 
tone that held a hint of worry.

&quot;Are they nocturnal?&quot; asked Miranda, walking in the opposite 
direction, her gaze sifting through the swarms of fish for any 
sign of pokemon.

&quot;No,&quot; called Misty, her voice sounding distant.

&quot;The he shouldn&#39;t be too hard to find,&quot; Miranda whispered to 
herself, glancing at a sleeping shellder and wondering both why 
and how it was snoring.

For several minutes, she walked along the arcing corridor, taking 
careful steps across the thinly carpeted floor, paying more 
attention to the aquarium than where she was going. After a short 
time, however, Miranda noticed a large, dark shape descending 
towards her through the water. Looking up, the woman could just 
make out a wide circular form with eight long, dark tentacles. 

With a smile, she watched it slowly descend, moving carefully 
through the water and adjusting its angle of descent with subtle 
movements of its tendrils. &quot;Curious creature,&quot; Miranda commented 
as the octopod angled itself forward and stared out at her with 
small curious eyes.

&quot;They&#39;re beautiful, aren&#39;t they?&quot; commented Misty, walking up 
beside Miranda as the woman stared back at the tentacruel.

&quot;They have a certain appeal,&quot; she agreed, giving the creature a 
mysterious smile that caused it to back away a bit, a look of 
alarm showing in its gleaming amber eyes, &quot;Is it yours?&quot;

Misty sighed sadly, shaking her head. &quot;No,&quot; she replied wistfully, 
&quot;She belongs to Lily. But she still listens to me though.&quot;

Miranda smiled, putting an arm around Misty. &quot;I guess the 
tentacruel can just tell who better trainer is,&quot; she teased as her 
lover waved to the pokemon.

&quot;You bet,&quot; chuckled Misty, finally catching the tentacruel&#39;s eye, 
&quot;Hey! Over here,&quot; she called with a wide smile, her eyes full of 
affection, &quot;I need a favor.&quot;

The tentacruel moved closer, extending her tentacles and placing 
two against the glass even as she gave Miranda a suspicious 
glance. The woman smiled, shaking her head in amusement as Misty 
placed her hands against the glass across from where the tendrils 
touched it. &quot;I&#39;m not sure she likes me,&quot; commented Miranda 
mirthfully, glancing at Misty and catching her eye.

&quot;She&#39;s just cautious,&quot; the water trainer assured, leaning forward 
and raising her voice a bit to be heard. &quot;I&#39;m looking for the 
pokemon I left here!&quot; Misty explained, her mouth close to the 
glass, &quot;Have you seen them?&quot;

The tentacruel bobbed up and down in an affirmative gesture before 
extending a tentacle meaningfully. &quot;In there with you?&quot; inquired 
Misty hopefully, to which the tentacruel replied by detaching from 
the wall of glass and darting off through the water.

&quot;Come on, she&#39;s going to show us,&quot; said Misty, grabbing Miranda&#39;s 
hand impulsively and leading the courier off down the hall, 
suppressing a laugh as she ran. 

&quot;I don&#39;t think she means in the tank,&quot; replied Miranda 
thoughtfully, tracking the pokemon as they hurried along, &quot;I think 
she&#39;s headed for the entrance.&quot;

&quot;I think you&#39;re right,&quot; replied Misty glumly, slowing as the 
tentacruel floated before the short exit hall and pointed with a 
tentacle out into the main gym area, &quot;I guess my sister&#39;s took the 
other one to the pokecenter or something.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s alright,&quot; assured Miranda, waving goodbye as the 
tentacruel began a rapid accent when she glanced at her, &quot;He&#39;d be 
asleep anyway. Which reminds me, should there be this much light 
in the aquarium?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; responded Misty, warily shaking her head as she looked up at 
the light source far above them, &quot;the timer must be broken again. 
I&#39;ll just shut it off up stairs.&quot;

&quot;Is that where your kitchen is?&quot; asked Miranda, her voice changing 
to a slightly playful tone, &quot;I&#39;m really hungry after looking at 
all these yummy fish!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare!&quot; laughed Misty, making her way back towards the 
pool, &quot;And yes, our living quarters is on the second floor along 
with the top of the aquarium. My parents always said that it was 
so we could keep our personal lives separate from our social 
responsibilities.&quot; 

&quot;Makes sense,&quot; Miranda agreed as they walked through the near 
darkness until they came to a locked door with a &#39;No Entry&#39; sign 
on it located at the far end of the pool, &quot;That&#39;s sorta what my 
family does as well. My parent&#39;s house is attached to the company 
buildings, but it&#39;s kept separate just the same. Oh, and it&#39;s near 
the ocean as well-&quot;

&quot;So I&#39;d like it,&quot; finished Misty with a smile as she opened a 
second door and lead Miranda into a comfortable living room, &quot;Ah! 
Welcome to my parlor!&quot;

&quot;I thought you hated bugs,&quot; commented Miranda with a smile, 
squinting as Misty hit the wall switch and several lamps 
illuminated. 

&quot;Just making sure you don&#39;t have a monopoly on melodrama,&quot; Misty 
assured her, glancing over one shoulder and heading towards a 
dimly lit hall, &quot;Now just make yourself at home and I&#39;ll be right 
back.&quot;

&quot;Sure!&quot; called Miranda, chuckling to herself as she took it all 
in, &quot;I&#39;ll just hog the remote, sit on the couch with no pants, eat 
everything in the fridge and yell at your kids...&quot;

&quot;You say something?&quot; came Misty&#39;s echoing voice from down the 
hall, followed by several loud clicking sounds.

&quot;Nothing!&quot; laughed Miranda, sitting down on an overstuffed couch 
and grabbing a handful of cashews from a small crystal bowl on the 
coffee table, &quot;Just quoting my mom!&quot;

&quot;Nice place, though,&quot; she commented, only half paying attention to 
the sound Misty made as she went from the aquarium room to the 
kitchen, &quot;And then I&#39;ll leave my under-things all over the place, 
run up a huge long distance bill, and- Oh my!&quot;

As Miranda&#39;s eyes scanned the room with it&#39;s thick plush 
carpeting, simulated wooden walls, a shelf filled with books that 
seemed untouched, and a wall unit filled with family mementos. She 
then spotted a large a painting that gave her reason to pause.

&quot;Wow,&quot; she commented, suddenly feeling guilty as she slid to her 
feet and stepped out from around the coffee table. 

Against one wall was a large fireplace that was probably only used 
for special occasions, its mantle filled with pictures of Misty 
and her sisters, but above it was a large, expensive looking 
painting. A small light fixture set innocuously into the ceiling 
illuminated the large portrait of a man and woman. They both 
seemed to be in their late twenties, with clothing that was in 
fashion at least three decades out of date. The woman had long 
dark hair, curled loosely and tumbling over the shoulders of her 
comfortably fitting dress, her emerald green eyes seeming to smile 
knowingly down at Miranda. The man at her side, who lovingly held 
her hand, was much taller, with long reddish hair that he tied 
tightly back, his icy blue eyes almost laughing with amusement as 
he gave Miranda a toothy, but benevolent grin.

&quot;Those are my parents,&quot; said Misty, startling Miranda as she 
quietly stepped up behind her, &quot;About a year or so after they were 
married. I&#39;m just glad my sisters haven&#39;t done anything strange 
with it.&quot;

&quot;I like it,&quot; replied Miranda, letting go of the shiver that crept 
down her spine and put her arm around Misty, &quot;It&#39;s better than 
some of the stern looking, grim portraits of some of my relatives. 
They look so happy, so alive. So in love.&quot;

&quot;They were,&quot; agreed Misty sadly as she leaned closer, &quot;And for a 
time they shared that love and happiness with us. But when they 
left, that&#39;s when things changed, and this place rapidly began to 
feel less and less like home.&quot;

Miranda turned to her, and carefully wiped a tear from Misty&#39;s eye 
with her index finger. &quot;And eventually you just left,&quot; she 
replied, causing Misty to nod sadly in agreement.

&quot;When I was old enough I told Violet that I couldn&#39;t take it 
anymore,&quot; continued Misty, allowing herself to be taken in by 
Miranda&#39;s warm embrace, &quot;I told her that our parents would never 
approve of the way she ran our household, and that I wasn&#39;t going 
to stand by and be used and mistreated anymore. I said I was 
leaving and never coming back.&quot;

Misty laughed, shaking her head at the thought before glancing up 
at Miranda with a wary smile. &quot;The things we say as children, eh?&quot; 
she said rhetorically, making Miranda hold her closer for a 
moment, &quot;But, as you know, I came back a few years later. And I&#39;ve 
visited once or twice since then. I just don&#39;t think that I could 
ever stay for good.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s alright,&quot; assured Miranda with a small smile, feeling 
strangely fulfilled as she held her lover in a time of need, &quot;I 
kinda know what that&#39;s like.&quot;

&quot;But you visit home more often,&quot; added Misty, laying her head upon 
Miranda&#39;s shoulder and looking contemplatively up at the painting 
of her parents, &quot;Once a year in October.&quot;

&quot;Since I caught Wraith,&quot; Miranda agreed, giving Misty a soft kiss 
atop the head, and breathing in the subtle scent of her hair, &quot;But 
I just use Hallowe&#39;en as an excuse. It still hurts to go back, but 
I can&#39;t just abandon my Mother, even if she has Bob and my Aunt 
Laurna. But tell my something, my love. Would they approve of me?&quot;

Misty tilted her head back and gave the portrait a serious look. 
&quot;I&#39;d like to think so,&quot; she replied thoughtfully as Miranda turned 
her gaze towards the couple as well, &quot;They were very easy going 
people. That&#39;s probably why my sisters became such brats, though. 
But what about your parents? What would your Father have thought 
of me? And what does your Mother think of me?&quot;

Miranda chuckled, shaking her head slowly as Misty gave her a 
questioning look. &quot;My Mother has yet to voice a strong opinion on 
the topic. But she never completely formulates and opinion of 
someone until she meets them face to face. So far we have her 
approval, though. So that&#39;s something.&quot;

&quot;And as for my Father,&quot; said Miranda, sighing heavily and smiling 
sadly as she turned back to Misty and caught her gaze, &quot;He&#39;d say 
that if can you make me happy, then you&#39;re a welcome addition to 
the family.&quot;

Misty smiled, feeling a bit embarrassed as Miranda leaned closer 
and gave her a small kiss. &quot;And what about your stepfather?&quot; she 
inquired with a hint of amusement.

&quot;He thinks you&#39;re cute,&quot; chuckled Miranda, giving another quick 
kiss and trying not to laugh.

&quot;That must drive your Mom crazy,&quot; Misty laughed in reply, leaning 
back and guiding Miranda back towards the couch.

&quot;Naw, Mom&#39;s a lot more easy going than she let&#39;s on,&quot; Miranda 
replied with a mischievous smile, &quot;She only pretends to act like a 
real mom. She&#39;s actually not even half as serious as people think 
she is. But I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll just love you to pieces!&quot;

&quot;Ow! That could be painful!&quot; laughed Misty, letting herself fall 
backwards, pulling Miranda down awkwardly over the arm of the 
couch and laughing as her lover struggled to regain equilibrium.

&quot;So&#39;s this,&quot; agreed Miranda with a laugh before rearranged herself 
so that she was straddling Misty, who&#39;s legs were bent over the 
arm of the couch.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Misty chuckled, reaching up to push Miranda&#39;s glasses 
back up her nose as they threatened to slid off, &quot;You just bring 
this out in me.&quot;

&quot;And you bring out my laughter,&quot; her lover added, giving Misty yet 
another gentle kiss, &quot;And for that, I thank you. By the way, are 
you cooking something?&quot;

&quot;Oh crap!&quot; Misty exclaimed, squirming out from beneath Miranda 
before hopping off the couch and pulling her shirt back down, &quot;I 
almost forgot!&quot;

&quot;I thought I was the one who was no good in the kitchen!&quot; laughed 
Miranda, leaning on the back of the couch, watching Misty as she 
fled into the gloom.

&quot;It&#39;s your curse rubbing off on me!&quot; replied Misty, chuckling 
before cursing loudly and making a bit of a commotion in the 
kitchen.

&quot;Need any help?&quot; inquired Miranda with concern as the clattering 
of dishes issued forth, followed by the sound of a glass breaking.

&quot;No, I&#39;m fine,&quot; assured Misty, her voice seeming unconvinced, &quot;I 
traveled with an unofficial chef for nearly five years remember. I 
had time to learn a trick or two!&quot;

&quot;Unofficial?&quot; inquired Miranda with amusement as Misty staggered 
from the kitchen with a huge platter held at least one quietly 
sizzling dish.

Misty nodded as she came around the couch and set the platter down 
on the coffee table. &quot;Brock was a natural at cooking,&quot; she 
explained, taking a seat next to Miranda and turning to face her, 
&quot;But pokemon were his obsession, so to my knowledge he never went 
for his red seal and became a real chef. Just his breeder 
license.&quot;

&quot;He chose to bring new pokemon into the world instead of cooking 
them, I guess,&quot; chuckled Miranda, glancing at the fajitas Misty 
had thrown together with whatever she could find in the kitchen, 
&quot;But it looks like you weren&#39;t wasting your time with him.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, only with Ash,&quot; agreed Misty, glancing distantly at the 
food, &quot;But I hope you like it.&quot;

Miranda took Misty&#39;s hand and held it close to her lips, causing 
her to glance back and smile a little at the mischief she saw in 
her lover&#39;s cloudy gray eyes. &quot;Then before I taste that which you 
have wrought, my love,&quot; replied Miranda melodramatically before 
giving Misty&#39;s knuckles a gentle kiss, &quot;I thank you for this 
delicious meal, so unlike any I&#39;ve had before.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll call the hospital and tell them to expect two cases of 
salmonella,&quot; chuckled Misty, unable to take the gesture seriously.

&quot;You know me too well,&quot; said Miranda with a smile, kissing Misty 
on the cheek before reaching out and carefully picking up one of 
the strips of meat that lay upon the pile of still steaming 
vegetables.

&quot;I found it in the back of the fridge,&quot; said Misty, smiling at 
Miranda&#39;s concerned look, and laughing at the horrified expression 
the woman wore as she took a small, all too careful bite.

&quot;Hey, not bad!&quot; replied Miranda with genuine appreciation; popping 
the rest into her mouth and quickly eating before speaking again. 
&quot;Spearow, right?&quot;

Misty nodded. &quot;One of the only pokemon I don&#39;t mind eating,&quot; she 
agreed with a touch of malice, &quot;Those things are just vicious!&quot;

&quot;So much for no pokemon being innately malevolent,&quot; Miranda 
chuckled, grabbing a plate and putting together and proper fajita, 
&quot;Although I&#39;d argue that that umbreon we saw tonight wasn&#39;t 
exactly Miss Congeniality.&quot;

&quot;The glowing red eyes threw me off,&quot; agreed Misty with a shudder, 
reaching for a plate as well, only to have Miranda hand her fajita 
one she&#39;d been putting together, &quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;Hey, you made it,&quot; replied Miranda with a loving smile as she 
went about fixing one for herself, &quot;And anyway, I wouldn&#39;t let red 
eyes throw me off if I were you. Bulbasaurs have red eyes.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s true,&quot; agreed Misty as Miranda poked at the 
guacamole skeptically, &quot;But bulbasaurs are cute. And they make 
flowers grow and stuff.&quot;

Miranda chuckled at the thought. &quot;Cute?&quot; she inquired, giving 
Misty an amused look.

&quot;Mmm, hm!&quot; assured Misty, nodding with a mouthful of fajita.

&quot;Well, I have heard that they&#39;re quite loyal, I can&#39;t argue with 
that,&quot; pondered Miranda, taking a bite of her food and chewing 
thoughtfully as Misty swallowed hard and reiterated her statement.

&quot;In a strange, lizard with a flower growing out of its back kinda 
way,&quot; she said thoughtfully before glancing mysteriously at her 
food, holding the fajita to her ear and whispering quietly out of 
the corner of her mouth, &quot;Bulbasaur!&quot; causing Miranda to cover her 
mouth laughing.

&quot;Last I checked, their on the &#39;No&#39; list in cerulean as far as 
eating goes,&quot; she replied with a smile as Misty gave her fajita an 
alarmed look and took another bite, &quot;Something about &#39;sufficient 
sentience&#39; or something?&quot;

Misty nodded as she finished chewing and swallowed. &quot;Yes,&quot; she 
agreed, suddenly remembering she&#39;d forgotten to bring them 
anything to drink, &quot;It&#39;s only legal to consume certain types of 
pokemon in most major cities. Even then they usually have to be 
only up to a certain evolution and can only be hunted for food at 
certain times of the year.&quot;

&quot;You planning on becoming a chef, dear?&quot; inquired Miranda.

&quot;No,&quot; laughed Misty in amusement, shaking her head and looking 
reminiscent, &quot;But as I said, Brock knew a lot about pokemon, and 
he occasionally talked about stuff like that. Although on the 
budget we had our meals were usually rather uninteresting.&quot;

&quot;Now you have a decent budget, but you lack a descent cook,&quot; 
chuckled Miranda.

&quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; agreed Misty, finishing her fajita and getting up 
to get a drink, &quot;But don&#39;t make your credit card smoke on my 
account. 

&quot;Nothing&#39;s too good for you, my dear,&quot; replied Miranda, leaning 
back her head back over the couch and looking at Misty with an 
upside down view.

&quot;There you go spoiling me again,&quot; her lover replied in amusement, 
giving Miranda a quick kiss before heading down the hall once 
again, &quot;I just hope you don&#39;t mind my bedroom.&quot;

&quot;Why would I?&quot; asked Miranda, settling back down.

&quot;I have a really small bed,&quot; responded Misty, leaning out of the 
kitchen, &quot;But at least I don&#39;t have to share a room with Daisy 
since Violet claimed our parent&#39;s room.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s okay,&quot; assured Miranda, &quot;Even the most humble of cots 
would be the lap of luxury were I to spend the night there with 
you in my arms. Although I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d feel comfortable 
sleeping in my parent&#39;s room. It would just feel... Wrong 
somehow...&quot;

&quot;Superstitious?&quot; Misty teased, ducking back into the kitchen.

&quot;Hey!&quot; laughed Miranda, &quot;I&#39;m from Lavender Town! What do you 
expect...?!&quot;</pre>
