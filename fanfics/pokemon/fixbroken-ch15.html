<p>Dawn let out a gasp when she heard   the gunshots ring out from within the house. She tried to see what was   happening through any of the windows, but not a single soul was visible.   Cursing under her breath, she ran back to the front of the door and   banged helplessly against it several times. No one answered.</p>
<p>Looking around, Dawn spotted a shovel   up against the house. Picking it up, she aimed directly for a window   and swung. She closed her eyes as she did this.</p>
<p>'Oh crap! Oh crap oh crap oh crap oh   crap oh crap! Please don't let me be too late! Please don't let me be   too late!' The glass shattered, and Dawn carefully made her way inside.   Even though some of the glass shards cut into her skin, she just ignored   the pain.</p>
<p>As soon as she got into the living   room of the house, Dawn called out, &quot;Zoey...Zoey...are you here?   Please...answer me! I...I want to help you!&quot; Suddenly, she heard   a click, and Dawn's eyes slowly moved to the direction of the sound.   Her body began to shake and tears started to form in her eyes when she   realized a gun was being aimed directly at her...by Zoey.</p>
<p>Zoey was shaking as well, and tears   were pouring down her pale face as well. Behind her, within the doorway   to the kitchen, the redhead's parents were peeking in and watching the   scene in fear. Although a gun was aimed at her head, Dawn let out a   sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank goodness,&quot; she said   as her own tears started to leak out, &quot;I was so afraid you killed   them, Zoey. There's no way you could be a murderer...&quot; Zoey, however,   seemed to have been pissed off even further by Dawn's comments.</p>
<p>Her grip on the pistol became tighter   as she snarled, &quot;...Shut up...I was going to kill them before you   came here! Please, Dawn...just leave and let me do what I have to do!   Those two CREATURES behind me...they aren't human! I'm their daughter   and they abandoned me! They don't even deserve to live! Why...why can'   t you understand how I feel?&quot;</p>
<p>Dawn knew that Zoey was close to completely   losing it...so she couldn't afford to make any mistakes. Slowly and   subtly taking one step forward, Dawn tried her best to calm Zoey down.</p>
<p>&quot;Zoey, please...&quot; she begged,   &quot;Don't do this. You don't really want to kill them...I know you   don't. Please, put the gun down and come back to the apartment. You   can live with me and Ash from now on, if you want. I'm serious, Zoey...take   a deep breath and drop the gun. I'll make sure you get help...I won't   let you slip through the cracks...you can trust me...&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey's body shook violently for a moment,   but she didn't pull the trigger. As Dawn came closer, the blue-haired   girl started to see the look of pure anguish that was spread across   Zoey's tear-stained face. 'Oh god...this poor young woman...the woman   I loved...she's in such emotional pain...' Dawn thought in despair.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zoey let out a small pained   chuckle. &quot;You're not going to let me slip through the cracks?&quot;   she asked, &quot;Is that what you said, Dawn? How ironic...it's because   of you that this is happening! For so long...for so long...ever since   we first met...I've...&quot; Whether it was her weakening mentality   or the fact she just couldn't take it anymore, Zoey knew it was time   to finally open up about her feelings.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Zoey said, &quot;Ever   since we first met as kids...I've...I've been completely and utterly   in love with you. Even now...all I want is for you to be with me forever...&quot;</p>
<p>Dawn wanted to cry out and hug Zoey   with all her might, but she couldn't do anything to possibly trigger   a reaction from the disgruntled redhead. For now, all she had to do   was continue to slowly make her way towards Zoey as she continued to   talk.</p>
<p>&quot;I had always wished I was brave   enough to tell you,&quot; Zoey continued, &quot;I would always dream   about you...I couldn't get you out of my head. Your beautiful face...your   body...your naive yet sweet personality...I loved it all. Please...please   don't think of me as a perverted stalker, though. I'm not...I...I just   want to love you...&quot;</p>
<p>At this point, Dawn felt that it was   safe enough for her to touch Zoey; it didn't look like she was planning   on pulling the gun's trigger anymore. &quot;Even when my parents disowned   me for loving another woman...even when I started cutting myself...even   as my entire life spiraled downhill...I still loved you...&quot; Zoey   said with a slight smile.</p>
<p>Finally, when she close enough, Dawn   wrapped her arms around Zoey and hugged her tightly. Zoey continued   to stare ahead for a while, but then she brought the gun down to her   side. Rubbing her face gently under Zoey's chin, Dawn whispered, &quot;Zoey...it'll   be okay...I love you...I really do...I love you so much...I want to   be with you too...&quot;</p>
<p>Before she could say anymore, Dawn   felt Zoey's lips press against hers. 'Mmm...she tastes like caramel   and cherries...' Dawn thought happily as she deepened the kiss. The   gun in Zoey's hand slipped out of her grip and it fell lifelessly to   the floor. As the two girls continued to kiss, their mouths became wet   with the salty tears that poured down their faces.</p>
<p>&quot;Dawn...I love you with all my   heart...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I love you too, Zoey...I love   you too...&quot;</p>
<p>'I LOVE YOU SO MUCH...'Â </p>
