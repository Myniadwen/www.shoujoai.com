<h1>Lavender Ghost Story (part 1 of 23)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nikolai.html">Nikolai Mirovich</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Route 8 became little more than two narrow parallel dirt paths separated by 
three-foot high dying weeds as the two cyclists rode through a region known as 
&#39;The Haunted Woods&#39;. Although the sun was still high in the late October sky, 
the forest on either side of them held ominous pockets of deep shadow and the 
unnerving sense of being watched was a constant factor. At times, the 
inhabitants of the dark wood rustled the near by trees, and strange, all too 
human screams would echo, some from safely far away, and others frighteningly 
close. 

But the most unnerving part of their journey towards Lavender Town wasn&#39;t the 
occasion sound of a child&#39;s whimpering, or the strange lights that beckoned 
unwary travelers into the depths of the forest, or even the ghostly call of 
murkrows. It was the calm, blaise almost bored expression on the face of Miranda 
Lilcamp as she peddled along the bumpy, treacherous path as though the whole 
thing were a regular occurrence.

Misty glanced over at her lover from time to time, her sea-green eyes as wide as 
dinner plates, her face so pale she almost seemed like a ghost herself. Upon the 
handlebars of her mountain-bike, the thoroughly unnerved trainer&#39;s knuckles were 
even whiter as she panted through gritted teeth. After nearly an hour of biking 
at top speed, Misty&#39;s legs were about to give out, and she&#39;d had to slow her 
pace, but there was no way she was going to stop until they reached their 
destination.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you don&#39;t find this the least bit unnerving!&quot; she muttered, 
wishing she could hold Miranda&#39;s hand for the a little reassurance it would 
bring. 

The courier shrugged, exhaling thoughtfully. &quot;Sorry, dear,&quot; she said with a weak 
smile, &quot;I&#39;ve lived here for most of my life, and I&#39;ve been through these woods 
dozens of times. Aunt Laurna says that the sounds are harmless. So long as you 
don&#39;t actually try to follow them in at night that is. Oh, and don&#39;t loose sight 
of the road.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s reassuring,&quot; Misty grumbled, nervously trying not to think about just 
how Professor Laurna, the world&#39;s premier ecto-parazoologist, had come about 
those findings, and just what happened to those who lost sight of the road, 
&quot;Just please promise me that when we get to your parent&#39;s place we can sit down 
in a nice, normal room, with no scary noises, no dark freak forests, and NO 
ghosts!&quot; &quot;Um, no offence to Wraith,&quot; she added hastily with a bit of a chuckle.

&quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;d understand, dear,&quot; replied Miranda with a smile, &quot;But, yes. 
Lavender is a surprisingly normal place most of the time. It&#39;s just these woods 
and the Tower you have to be careful about. I&#39;m sure you saw how boring it was 
last time you were here.&quot;

Misty shrugged as she stood up on her pedals to see if the town was in sight 
yet. &quot;Actually we really didn&#39;t do very much site seeing,&quot; she explained half 
sadly, &quot;You know Ash, rush, rush, rush.&quot;

Miranda twitched a bit and quickly changed the subject, &quot;You know, if you don&#39;t 
let them scare you, ghosts really aren&#39;t that bad.&quot;

Her lover glanced over at her, sitting back down and giving a weak smile. &quot;I 
know,&quot; Misty replied, &quot;And I&#39;m mostly used to Wraith... Again. But strange 
ghosts still unnerve me.&quot;

&quot;Even after that incident in Saffron?&quot; Miranda inquired, unable to hide the 
involuntary look of helplessness that crossed her face at the thought of what 
happened when she had challanged Sabrina.

Misty smirked, finding the incident vastly more amusing. &quot;What?&quot; she inquired 
teasingly, noticing how uncomfortable it made Miranda, &quot;You&#39;ve said before that 
ghosts occasionally behave in strange and unpredictable ways...&quot;

&quot;But... But they...&quot; Miranda stammered, leaning back on her bike and peddling 
handless as she looked imploringly at her lover, &quot;They played rock, paper, 
scissors to see who&#39;d win!&quot;

&quot;Best two out of three!&quot; laughed Misty, wishing all ghosts were as amusing as 
Wraith or Sabrina&#39;s Rakshasha.

Miranda sighed heavily, shaking her head in utmost dismay. &quot;Ya know,&quot; she 
commented guiltily, &quot;I really think I should have given that badge back.&quot;

Misty found it hard to stop laughing at the thought of Wraith and Rakshasha 
facing off against one another. For several long dramatic moments, the two 
haunters had stared one another down, exchanging ghostly threats and macho 
posturing. But once they&#39;d started trying to out do each other by seeing who 
could do the most warped and condeluded things with their own ephemera, Miranda 
finally lost patience and ordered Wraith to attack. 

Wraith had responded quickly enough, both haunters suddenly glowing with a dark 
purple light, ready to blast one another with nightshade, but that was when 
Rakshasha suddenly realized he had the wrong hands. The two haunters spent 
another five minutes trying to figure out who&#39;s floating disembodied hands were 
who&#39;s and eventually just gave up the concept of dueling, and played rock, paper 
scissors instead.  

&quot;But Sabrina apparently found it funny!&quot; Misty chuckled, forgetting all about 
the strange noises that followed them as the trees seemed to loom closer, their 
dry, twisted branches slowly beginning to creep together above the traveler&#39;s 
heads until they nearly blocked out the sun entirely. 

Miranda sighed, deciding to give up. &quot;Well, at least you got see what Umberlee 
was really capable of,&quot; she added as a small bright light appeared in the 
distance.

Misty nodded, a prideful smile crossing her face. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she said proudly, &quot;It 
was certainly nice of some of the instructors at the school to give me some 
advice on tapping into her true potential.&quot;

&quot;Saves her learning from Wraith,&quot; Miranda chuckled teasingly, catching Misty&#39;s 
sudden shudder.

&quot;I think she picked up enough bad habits already. Living with my sisters all 
that time couldn&#39;t have helped,&quot; the trainer said with a bit of shudder before 
catching a glimpse of civilization not far ahead, &quot;Hey! Isn&#39;t that Lavender 
Town?&quot;

Miranda turned to look, just as the two narrow paths began to merge with a 
single lane gravel road. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she replied a little distantly, noticing the 
purple hued cobblestones of the road ahead, and making out the shapes of the 
large, Victorian style houses of her home town, &quot;it won&#39;t be long now.&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; said Misty, her tone serious, &quot;I just want you to know, I was serious 
when I said I&#39;d help you out when we got there, eh.&quot;

Miranda nodded. &quot;I know,&quot; she said quietly as a cold breeze met them just as 
they left the forest behind, &quot;This Halloween&#39;s going to be different than any 
other. I can feel it.&quot;

&quot;In a good way?&quot; inquired Misty hopefully, ignoring the Lavender Town population 
sign that had what appeared to be a huge bite taken out of it where the actual 
population number would have been.

The courier glanced at her with a weak smile, her cloudy gray eyes searching 
Misty&#39;s. &quot;In a good way,&quot; she promised, suddenly grabbing the handlebars as her 
bike tires hit the cobblestones, &quot;Just promise me you&#39;ll back me up if I need 
it.&quot;

Misty gave her a curious look. &quot;How so?&quot; she inquired suspiciously.

Miranda glanced out across the field of half harvested corn to her right, trying 
to make out the rooftop of the Lilcamp Trading Company&#39;s head office. &quot;My mom&#39;s 
always trying to get me to stay,&quot; she explained sullenly, &quot;But I can&#39;t. It&#39;s 
just too sad here. And besides, if I quit being courier crew and got a cushy 
admin&#39; job like she wants me to, we&#39;d have never met, right?&quot;

Her beloved gave the courier a concerned look. &quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; she agreed with a 
tight smile, &quot;But you know that it&#39;s just because she misses you.&quot;

The woman nodded sadly. &quot;I know, I know,&quot; she muttered, giving a short wave to 
the group of children, all varying in age, who were helping their parents in the 
next field over which was filled with wheat, &quot;I don&#39;t mean to be a bad daughter 
or anything, but she has Bob. She doesn&#39;t really need me there all the time, 
right?&quot;

Misty sighed heavily, breaking hard and causing her bike to skid dangerously 
across the cobblestone road. &quot;Miranda,&quot; she said in a serious tone, her eyes 
seeming hard and unyielding as she gave her lover a look that broached no 
argument, &quot;Look, I don&#39;t mean to be harsh about this, but...&quot;

&quot;I should be thankful for what I have,&quot; Miranda finished for her, stopping her 
bike a little ahead of Misty&#39;s before circling around to park beside her, &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry, dear. I guess I just get caught up in my own selfish misery.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s okay,&quot; Misty assured her as they hugged awkwardly astride their mountain 
bikes, &quot;I don&#39;t expect you to be perfect.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; replied Miranda with a bit of a chuckle, &quot;I&#39;d hate to be on that 
high a pedestal.&quot; 

&quot;Didn&#39;t know you were afraid of heights,&quot; Misty teased, leaning away and 
laughing as she pushed down hard on her bike pedal to get a head start on the 
final leg of their journey.

&quot;As if!&quot; laughed Miranda as she got her bike turned around, saving her next 
comment for when she finally caught up with Misty, half way to the nearest major 
intersection. &quot;The only thing I&#39;m really afraid of,&quot; she said breathlessly, &quot;is 
loosing you...&quot;</pre>
