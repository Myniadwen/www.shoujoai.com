<h1>Cerulean Dreams (part 19 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nikolai.html">Nikolai Mirovich</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/cerulean-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>Misty&#39;s old beat-up alarm clock went off at exactly midnight, and 
a few minutes after Miranda had reached over and shut it off, they 
were both dressed and had quietly snuck out of the gym without 
waking anyone. The two then hopped on their bikes and coasted most 
of the way through a series of winding side streets, carefully 
avoiding the main road until they reached their destination.

As they rode through the small section of town dominated mostly by 
small family owned shops, Miranda heard a quietly squeaked warning 
in her ear. &quot;What is it?&quot; she asked, squeezing her handbrakes and 
taking her feet off the pedals as she skidded to a stop.

The rattata on her shoulder scurried down her arm to stand upon 
the bike&#39;s handlebars before sniffing the air again. &quot;Nez,&quot; he 
confirmed with a nod, glancing meaningfully at Misty as she 
skidded to a stop beside Miranda.

&quot;Something wrong?&quot; she inquired, straining her ears to hear what 
concerned the little rodent so much, but all that she could make 
out was the gentle hum of the street lamps and quiet gurgling of 
the river only a block or so away. 

&quot;We&#39;re being watched,&quot; Miranda replied, leaning back and peering 
into the darkened storefronts as she slowly drew her bokken, &quot;Any 
idea where, Nezumi?&quot;

The rattata closed his eyes and stood on his hindquarters, his 
whiskers twitching slightly as he moved his head slowly from side 
to side. &quot;Ra,&quot; he replied sadly glancing around with equal 
suspicion.

&quot;It could be nothing,&quot; Misty offered, zipping her coat up a little 
higher as a sudden cold wind blew past them, heralding the 
entrance of a dark figure from a nearby alleyway.

&quot;Nothing?&quot; inquired Ash in a bitter tone as he stepped out into 
the street, &quot;That&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong, &#39;old friend&#39;.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; replied Miranda thoughtfully, &quot;I think Misty&#39;s right. It was 
nothing.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; the trainer exclaimed angrily, &quot;Pikachu! Thu-! What-? 
Where-?!&quot;

There was a quiet snickering as Ash ran back into the alley and 
came back a moment later with a struggling pikachu in his arms. 
&quot;Misty!&quot; the trainer called out formally, setting the pokemon down 
but keeping a firm hold of the creature&#39;s shoulders, &quot;I- I 
challenge you!&quot;

Misty sighed, hiding her face in her hand as she shook her head in 
dismay. &quot;We really don&#39;t have time for this,&quot; she muttered, 
glancing at him from between two fingers, &quot;Why don&#39;t you just go 
home? I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a hundred or so other people you&#39;ve ticked 
off in the last couple of years who&#39;d love a rematch.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care!&quot; Ash exclaimed, stomping his foot and causing his 
pikachu to jump a little as he stared up at Misty apprehensively, 
&quot;I&#39;ve spent the last month and a half studying up on gyaradoses 
and I&#39;m not about to let all that time go to waste!&quot;

&quot;You want to have a battle? Here?&quot; Misty exclaimed in disbelief, 
looking around nervously and wondering how many people Ash&#39;s 
ranting had woken up already, &quot;Between Charizard and Leviathan? 
Are you insane?!&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Ash replied simply, a cunning smile crossing his thin lips, 
&quot;I intent to use Pikachu. A little lightning ought&#39;a put you and 
that dragon of yours in your place.&quot;

&quot;Whatever,&quot; Misty muttered, unzipping her coat again and pulling 
out a pokeball, &quot;let&#39;s just get this over with...&quot;

&quot;And don&#39;t you dare interfere, cheater!&quot; Ash warned, pointing 
angrily at Miranda. 

&quot;Misty can fight her own battles,&quot; the courier assured him, 
sheathing her sword and chuckling as Leviathan materialized beside 
his trainer, &quot;And don&#39;t worry, Nezumi&#39;s saving the cryokinetics 
for later.&quot;

Ash glowered at her for a moment, barely noticing the loud; heavy 
breathing that caused a cloud of visible hot air to slowly rise 
all around him. Not to mention the quiet whimper that Pikachu let 
out as he tugged desperately at his trainer&#39;s pant leg.

&quot;What is it now?!&quot; he demanded at last as Miranda glanced to her 
right smiling, &quot;Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m-! Oh man!&quot;

Leviathan&#39;s long scaly body slowly uncoiled as he arched himself 
higher into the air before looming dangerously close to Ash, 
leering hungrily down at the large yellow furred rodent at his 
feet. The trainer looked into the gyarados&#39;s huge dark eyes and 
gulped as Leviathan hungrily drooled saliva that puddled at 
Pikachu&#39;s feet as the monstrous, amphibious serpent looked up to 
meet the impudent human&#39;s gaze.

&quot;You still wanna battle?&quot; Misty teased, she reaching out to run 
her fingers affectionately across Leviathan&#39;s glistening blue 
scales, causing the creature to turn his enormous head around to 
face her, &quot;My little friend here hasn&#39;t eaten in a few hours and 
he&#39;s VERY hungry. Isn&#39;t that right, you little sweetheart?&quot; 

Ash&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief as he stood stammering, watching 
as Misty affectionately scratched the gyarados&#39;s eye ridges until 
Leviathan closed his eyes contentedly and made a happy growling 
sound somewhere deep in his throat.

&quot;We- We&#39;re not afraid of some overgrown magikarp! Are we, Pikachu? 
Pikachu?!&quot; Ash&#39;s attempt at melodrama was brought to an abrupt 
halt as he glanced down at his feet and found himself alone.

&quot;Come back here!&quot; he shouted, running back a short distance to 
grab his pokemon who seemed to be in the process of sneaking away 
by the scruff of the neck, &quot;Now thunderbolt that thing already!&quot;

Leviathan&#39;s monstrous head swung around immediately, his suddenly 
glowing red eyes staring right into the smaller creature&#39;s soul as 
Ash held the hapless pikachu forward with both hands.

&quot;Pika!&quot; the electrokinetic rodent exclaimed in abject horror, 
scrambling to turn himself around in Ash&#39;s arms before tearing the 
lining of the trainer&#39;s coat to ribbons with his small claws in an 
attempt to escape.

&quot;Your pikachu obviously doesn&#39;t want to battle,&quot; Miranda 
commented, not finding the situation as funny as her rattata 
seemed to, but making no motion to keep Nezumi from the sudden 
laughter he&#39;d broken into, &quot;Don&#39;t you know it&#39;s cruel to force 
someone you care about to do something they don&#39;t want to.&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; shouted Ash accusingly, showing all too well that his 
maturity level still didn&#39;t match his age, &quot;What do you know? You 
only do this fun! You don&#39;t take pokemon battles seriously! So 
stay out of this, amateur!&quot;

Miranda sighed warily, almost feeling sorry for Ash as his 
desperate tone echoed in her ears, but refusing to baited by such 
a childish taunt. &#39;Well, at least she&#39;s holding it together,&#39; the 
courier thought, glancing over at Misty who was now clenching her 
fists as she glared at her former traveling companion. 

&#39;Goodness she&#39;s beautiful when she&#39;s angry,&#39; Miranda mused, 
blushing a bit as she felt her body react on a primal level. &#39;Oh 
my...&#39; the courier thought inwardly, glancing down at herself as a 
peculiar tingle spread though her at about the same time Misty 
gritted her teeth and prepared to initiate an attack, &#39;What an odd 
thing to feel at a time like this...&#39;

As Ash practically tossed poor Pikachu towards monstrous gyarados, 
Misty&#39;s words rang out into the night. &quot;Leviathan! Tail-whip!&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; laughed Ash as loudly and tauntingly as he could, even as 
the enormous serpent uncoiled his tong sinewy body and his finned 
tail lashed out in a wide arc, &quot;You taught that fish of yours 
&#39;tail-whip&#39;? Are you nuts? That&#39;s not even a real attack! It just-
! Oh my-! Pikachuuuu!!!&quot;

Had Miranda not been straddling her bike, she would have taken a 
step back. As she and Nezumi looked on in a mixture of awe and 
amusement, Leviathan snapped just the very end of his tail at 
Pikachu, filling the air with a quick sonic blast that rattled 
windows, popped everyone&#39;s eardrums and sent the smaller pokemon 
sailing into the air.  

&quot;No! That&#39;s not fair-!&quot; exclaimed Ash, hopping over the serpent&#39;s 
tail as he ran after his airborne pikachu who slowly rotated as he 
swiftly fell to earth at a sharp angle, screaming the entire way. 

A short moment later, a frightened ball of yellow fur collided 
with and completely shattered the window of a deli, sending shards 
of sharp glass everywhere and the sound of a wailing alarm from 
within that joined with Pikachu&#39;s loud, angry exclamations to form 
an earsplitting cacophony.

&quot;I&#39;ll get you for this!&quot; shouted Ash as he ran the block and a 
half to where his pokemon had made a crash landing before leaping 
through the shattered window and madly tossing aside strings of 
linked sausages, wheals of cheese and blocks of dried meat out 
into the street in an attempt to rescue his friend.

A moment later, however, a blindingly bright light illuminated the 
area from behind the suddenly startled trainer. &quot;Alright, buddy,&quot; 
called out a bored sounding voice with a hint of a Scottish 
accent, &quot;I think that&#39;ll be quite enough, don&#39;t you?&quot;

Ash turned to face the speaker, but immediately regretted it as 
the pokeforce officer&#39;s flashlight blinded him. &quot;Off- Officer, I-&quot; 
he stammered, only to feel the sharp sting of metal across his 
wrist before being easily thrown to the floor.

&quot;Save it for Jenny,&quot; muttered Officer Geoff in an annoyed tone, 
his mind still obsessing on his dismissal from his job as a Sylph 
Co security guard after the incident that gave Miranda Lilcamp her 
gastly, but he hated owing Officer Frank more than anything. Even 
more than taking the cop&#39;s night patrol for him. 

&#39;Oh well,&#39; thought Geoff, looking on the bright side for once as 
Ash struggled and complained, &#39;At least I caught myself a 
thief...&#39;

***

Frank looked up as Bow let out a low whine. Down the street, 
approaching slowly from where Sea Breeze Way became Route 4, he 
could make out two figures on bicycles. As they approached, one 
waved silently.

&quot;You ready?&quot; the cop inquired, glancing down at the growlithe 
whose tail was going a mile a minute. 

&#39;Bring it on!&#39; she yipped in pokespeak, causing Frank to chuckle 
lightly as he adjusted the folds of his long dark brown trench 
coat, the twin revolvers he wore making him a little self-
conscious in regards to their concealablity.

Frank gave a short wave as his almost-niece and her lover skidded 
to a halt not far from where Frank was leaning against the back of 
the city&#39;s welcoming sign. &quot;Have any trouble getting here?&quot; he 
inquired with a mischievous smile as Miranda walked her bike 
towards him.

&quot;Nothing we couldn&#39;t handle,&quot; the courier assured him with a 
chuckle as Nezumi hopped off the bike and scurried over to Bow, 
&quot;Or Leviathan to be more precise.&quot;

Misty grinned broadly as she waved a pokeball at Frank in 
amusement. &quot;It was both childish, and deeply satisfying,&quot; the 
trainer replied with a bit of a chuckle as Frank pushed himself 
away from the sign and stepped over Bow, moving closer to keep his 
voice low.

&quot;So?&quot; he inquired with a glance to the North, half trying to make 
out the distant image of Ces Batards De L&#39;autre Cote De La Rue 
Restaurant Of International Cuisine, &quot;You ladies ready?&quot;

The two nodded. &quot;As we&#39;ll ever be,&quot; assured Miranda, &quot;Any idea, 
though, as to where we should stash our bikes?&quot;

Frank nodded reassuringly. &quot;Yeah, we&#39;ll just put them with the 
car,&quot; he told them with a wave of his hand before heading back 
along Route 4.

&quot;They gave you a new car then?&quot; inquired Misty with an amused 
glance at Bow, who had somehow caused Nezumi to gulp loudly and 
look strangely pale, &quot;Your growlithe must be happy.&quot;

The pokeforce officer chuckled to himself for a moment. &quot;Actually, 
miss,&quot; he admitted, glancing over his shoulder in time to see 
Miranda&#39;s sudden twitch to his response, &quot;It&#39;s Jen&#39;s. But she 
won&#39;t mind. Assuming she never finds out that I borrowed it...&quot;

***

As Nezumi leapt off the handlebars of Miranda&#39;s bike, Bow looked 
up at him and yipped a quick greeting. &quot;Hey! Pyro-puppy!&quot; the 
rattata exclaimed, bounding over to the canine with a renewed 
energy, &quot;Waz&#39;happen-iiing?&quot;

Bow sat down on her haunches, giving the human&#39;s half a glance as 
they discussed things. &quot;Feeling better, I see,&quot; she replied with 
smile, her tone a little concerned.

&quot;Ah well,&quot; said Nezumi with a nonchalant shrug, &quot;I finally had a 
chance to yank all those freakin&#39; spooky-eevee hairs outta my fur, 
so I&#39;m doin&#39; good. And I&#39;ll be doing even better once we kick some 
dark chef butt and put Boss Lady there in a better mood.&quot;

Bow nodded. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she whispered, leaning in conspiratorially as 
Frank stepped carefully over her, &quot;He&#39;s been all weird the last 
while. Won&#39;t eat a thing! Which means of course, &#39;I&#39; don&#39;t get to 
eat either! So you see the problem?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; laughed Nezumi, &quot;You&#39;re spoilt rotten!&quot;

&quot;Spoilt?&quot; replied Bow, tossing her long, lacy fur out of her eyes, 
&quot;Me? I am NOT spoilt. I&#39;m simply pampered. And let me tell you, 
little mouse, I&#39;m worth it!&quot;

Nezumi&#39;s jaw dropped as the growlithe invoked a simple technique 
(that humans claimed involved the release of pheromones and most 
referred to simply as &#39;Charm&#39;) that caused everything else around 
him to fuzz out slightly. The only image that the little rattata&#39;s 
vision could clearly focus on was Bow, her bright red and gleaming 
white fur seeming glow with an inner light that caused the already 
more than adorable growlithe seem even more irresistibly cute.

&quot;Gah...&quot; commented Nezumi loosing his thought for a moment, his 
brain going into a default setting as the humans started walking 
away, &quot;Say, did you know that we rattatas is always &#39;in season&#39;?&quot;

Bow chuckled as she turned to follow Frank, to then ends of the 
earth if necessary. &quot;That, my dear,&quot; she replied with a 
mischievous grin as she swished her tail to bat Nezumi playfully 
across the face, &quot;Is quite true. Your kind produces thousands of 
offspring every year. However, that&#39;s only because we   predators 
simply can&#39;t resist the taste of your sweet yummy flesh.&quot;

Nezumi went pale for a moment as Bow laughed. &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; she 
called back teasingly, &quot;I&#39;m NOT a meowth!&quot;

&quot;Thankfully,&quot; the rattata muttered, shaking his head clear and 
scurrying after the group, &quot;But hey! Did you know that our 
offspring would be able to see in no less than two hundred and 
fifty six different shades of gray?!&quot;

&quot;Give it up, Nezzy!&quot; Bow laughed, suddenly wondering if they&#39;d be 
able to raid the pantry once they&#39;d arrested the criminal chef. 
&#39;Silly human,&#39; the growlithe muttered with mock severity as she 
caught up with Frank, &#39;It&#39;s waaaay past dinner time...!&#39;

***

Chef Troy took off his hat, letting his long, dirty blond hair 
fall about his shoulders as he wiped the sweat from his brow with 
a towel that one of his commise instantly handed to him. &quot;What a 
day,&quot; he muttered cynically; accepting the water bottle another 
handed to him as his kitchen staff hurriedly cleaned up and made 
the place ready for the morning rush, &quot;Oh well. At least our 
&#39;guests&#39; have moved on.&quot;

One of the commises glanced up from where she was wiping a 
countertop down and shuddered visibly. &quot;With all due respect, 
sir,&quot; the woman commented, keeping her gaze respectfully lowered, 
even as Troy crouched down to pick up Salmonella who seemed to be 
in an affectionate mood, &quot;Ms. Forester scares me. Her lover is 
cute, though.&quot;

Troy smirked evilly. &quot;Very true,&quot; he agreed, the hair on the back 
of his neck suddenly standing on end. 

Instinctively, even before hearing Salmonella&#39;s warning hiss, the 
dark Chef turned on his heel in time to see the strange distortion 
effect as an oddly proportioned figure teleported directly in 
front of him.

&#39;My, Mistress sends her regards, Chef Troy.&#39; The words were 
planted directly into the man&#39;s mind by the female alakazam 
without a thought as to whether he consented to the mental 
intrusion.

&quot;Talia,&quot; replied Troy through gritted teeth as he petted the 
umbreon in his arms compulsively, &quot;so nice to see you again. Did 
you forget something, my dear? Or are you just here to reimburse 
me for the loss of my computer system. Not to mention ALL my 
secret recipes!&quot;

The alakazam chuckled, both in reality and in Troy&#39;s mind. &#39;Fear 
not, Chef,&#39; the psychic type assured him, thoughtfully combing the 
long white whiskers that sprouted from her short snout as she 
glanced at the gawking commises, &#39;Rockets take care of their own. 
Or so I&#39;m told. And I&#39;m sure that my Mistress can give &quot;Uncle 
Auggie&quot; a call on your behalf.&#39;

Troy cringed at the lack of respect that the pokemon showed for 
Augustus Giovanni. The man had made the leadership of both 
Viridian City and Team Rocket his life&#39;s work. He&#39;d even 
personally funded Chef Troy&#39;s latest endeavor, and no doubt many 
of Professor Katherine Forester&#39;s as well. 

&quot;So tell me, Tal,&quot; the Chef said conversationally, hoping to goad 
the overgrown psionic vole into causing trouble, &quot;How&#39;s Tashiro 
doing? That little brain aneurysm all cleared up yet?&quot;

Talia gritted her teeth, her voice in Troy&#39;s mind sounding darker 
as she spoke. &#39;The reptile shall survive,&#39; she hissed in 
annoyance, &#39;But the damage to his brain was substantial. He shall 
have a few problems for a time, but once he advances to his adult 
phase, Tashiro shall be whole once more!&#39;

&quot;Give him my best regards, then,&quot; Troy replied with a shrug, 
turning to go back to his duties.

&#39;Wait, human!&#39; Talia commanded contemptuously, causing a peculiar 
reverberation in the air that caused several people to scream and 
at least one to drop the stack of plates he&#39;d be carrying, &#39;I am 
NOT here simply to socialize.&#39;

&quot;Then make it quick,&quot; growled Troy, turning back around and 
intending to take no guff from a mere pokemon.

&#39;My Mistress wishes to expand this current endeavor,&#39; Talia 
answered, ignoring the list of alakazam recipes that suddenly 
filled Chef Troy&#39;s mind, &#39;She wishes you to get in touch with your 
many cousins and-&#39;

But Talia&#39;s words were cut short as across the room the door to 
the loading dock slid up into the ceiling and three very annoyed 
looking people stepped boldly into the room.

&quot;Chef Troy?&quot; called the plain-clothed pokeforce officer in loud, 
authoritative tone as commises scrambled out of his way, &quot;The 
name&#39;s Officer Frank, and I&#39;m callin&#39; you out!&quot;

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; muttered Troy with a smile, stepping around the 
alakazam and out into the far aisle, &quot;Yes... Officer, is it? I can 
only presume that you have a reason for bursting into MY kitchen 
with your little &#39;posse&#39;? Or is it that all the donut shops in 
Cerulean City have finally closed for the evening?&quot;

&quot;Actually,&quot; replied Frank with a sudden grin, finding the comment 
more amusing than insulting, &quot;I&#39;m here to arrest you.&quot;

&quot;Oh really? On what charges?&quot; inquired Troy in an innocently 
condescending tone, as Salmonella glared evilly at the growlithe 
at Frank&#39;s feet.

&quot;Serving non-food pokemon in your restaurant!&quot; accused Misty, 
stepping forward and clenching her fist threateningly.

The dark Chef gave her an amused, patronizing smile, &quot;Then I can 
only presume that you have evidence to support this claim. Is that 
right, Officer?&quot;

&quot;Well, um, no... Nothing legal,&quot; Frank replied, shuffling his feet 
and looking embarrassed for a moment before meeting Troy&#39;s steely 
gaze, &quot;But you know how Officer Jenny is... She&#39;d ticket you for 
jaywalking in your living room! Of course, I MIGHT go easy on ya 
if you told me where Katherine Forester&#39;s gotten herself off to. I 
got a score to settle for an old friend you see. And so does his 
daughter as a matter of fact.&quot;

Miranda stepped to one side and grinned threateningly at the chef, 
who simply ignored her out of hand even as she reached for the 
wooden sword attached to her belt. &quot;It&#39;s just too bad really,&quot; 
said Troy casually as he turned to walk away,  &quot;You just missed 
her by about an hour or so, and besides, revenge is a dish best 
served cold. Now then, if you&#39;re done, kindly leave. I&#39;m a busy 
man, and I don&#39;t have time for such childish games.&quot;

Chef Troy stopped, a wide, amused grin crossing his face as all 
noise in the kitchen stopped dead as the sound of the safeties 
coming off two pistols that echoed throughout the room. 

&quot;Hold it right there, sir,&quot; said Frank grimly, &quot;I don&#39;t wanna 
cause a scene here, but there&#39;s some black marks on your record 
that I think you should be answerin&#39; for. And harboring a wanted 
criminal is the least of &#39;em.&quot;

&quot;Now detective,&quot; chuckled Chef Troy, stealthy snatching a large 
gleaming and sliding it up his sleeve as he set Salmonella down on 
the counter before raising his hands and turning back around, 
&quot;surly you know what the penalty for drawing a gun is? Let alone 
two?&quot;

&quot;Nine. Each,&quot; answered Frank indignantly as he leveled both 
revolvers on Chef Troy, &quot;That&#39;s the number of reports I have to 
fill out. Fourteen each just for pointin&#39; em at ya, and thirty one 
apiece if I have ta explain why yer arms are floppin on the ground 
as opposed to still bein&#39; attached to your shoulders. So what&#39;cha 
say I paint you a little picture. You see, the less you cooperate, 
the angrier you make me. And the angrier I get, the more reports I 
have to fill out. And you know what? Filling out reports makes me 
VERY angry. So you can see where this is going, can&#39;t&#39;cha? A real 
vicious cycle, eh?&quot;

&quot;Then perhaps, detective,&quot; replied the dark Chef as he lowered his 
arms and in one smooth motion, retrieved the aerodynamic kitchen 
knife from up his sleeve before tossing it in Frank&#39;s direction, 
&quot;I should teach you a lesson in anger management!&quot; 

Frank&#39;s eyes widened as he instinctively threw himself to the 
floor, his trigger fingers already moving back and forth, sending 
a hail of high velocity steel-jacketed lead into the air as the 
knife sailed in an unerring line towards the spot where he&#39;d been 
standing.

&quot;Look out!&quot; shouted Miranda over the noise, immediately reaching 
out with her hand, catching the knife a mere inch from where it 
would have plowed into Misty&#39;s forehead.

&quot;Whoa...&quot; her lover replied, going pale and shaking even as a 
mildly hysterical grin crossed her face, &quot;Thanks, Miri!&quot;

&quot;It gets worse!&quot; Miranda warned, motioning to the sudden odd sound 
of bullets ricocheting off something distinctly unnatural.

They both glanced over and saw Talia, standing before Chef Troy 
with an amused grin as she casually held her four-fingered hand 
out before her, causing a barrier of curious red light that 
stopped the bullets in their tracks. 

&quot;Kazam,&quot; she chided, shaking her head in mild amusement, as the 
loud explosive sound of Frank&#39;s pistols gave way to an ominous 
clicking. 

&quot;Oh, oh...&quot; muttered Frank, a second before a pair of spoons 
materialized in the alakazam&#39;s hands and the cop went sailing into 
the air in response to a raised hand.

&quot;I- I&#39;m alright!&quot; assured Frank as he suddenly found himself being 
grabbed by the right wrist and right ankle by an unseen force 
before being spun in place in response to the swirling motion 
Talia made with one of her spoons, &quot;I&#39;m just a little airsick-!

For an uncertain moment, Miranda watched as her almost-uncle spun 
in the air before being released, landing on a long counter, only 
to slide the entire way down, knocking off a variety of metal 
bowls and stacked plates before crashing off the end with an 
equally loud clatter. This was followed by a panicked yelp from 
Bow who then proceeded to run in the direction her human had been 
thrown in.

&quot;I- I&#39;m fine!&quot; called Frank, &quot;It&#39;s just my spleen! Don&#39;t worry 
about me!&quot;

&quot;Alright, that&#39;s it!&quot; growled Miranda though gritted teeth, 
tossing the knife aside as she produced a pokeball from seemingly 
nowhere, &quot;Nezumi! Wraith! Umi! Triple attack &#39;Omega Beam&#39;!&quot;

In the time it took for the pokeball in her hand to activate, and 
for Umi to materialize from within the device, Wraith had stirred 
from his hiding place in Miranda&#39;s pokedex and chose a rather 
disturbing method of coming on the scene. He phased his way out of 
Miranda&#39;s backpack, through the courier, and seemingly out of her 
chest, causing her to shiver slightly as Nezumi also ran from 
hiding to stand beside the materializing dratini. 

As one, the trio let out a confirming exclamation before executing 
the technique. It began with Wraith smiling balefully and 
radiating an eerie dark purple light as he floated back to hover 
just over the heads of his companions. Meanwhile, Nezumi glowed 
with a blinding white radiance, shifting into raticate mode as an 
odd crackling sound emanated from just in front of his incisors 
followed by a shifting blue/white light that seemed to draw in all 
warmth in the area. For her part, Umi reared up like a snake 
preparing to bite, snarling at the alakazam menacingly as orange 
flames licked across her sharp pointy bared teeth.

Then, as one, the three pokemon released their fury. Nezumi puffed 
out his cheeks and exhaled fiercely, his claws all but digging 
into the linoleum tiled floor as the beam of pure, focused cold 
shot forth as Wraith&#39;s three fingered hands dropped down, hovering 
on either side of the beam as dark purple light flowed from his 
open palms, merging with the ice beam near its point of origin.
And finally, Umi lunged forward, spitting out a small ball of 
burning flame that somehow became trapped in the strange energy 
beam&#39;s gravity, before spinning and spiraling down its length.

Talia&#39;s now dark, featureless eyes widened in panic as the ice-
beam hit her psychic barrier like an elemental battering ram. The 
shimmering red haze shuddered, as icy tendrils of frost crept 
across its surface, radiating out from the point of impact. A 
heartbeat later, and Wraith&#39;s dark-chi hit, causing the barrier to 
buckle, crack and finally shatter.

With a frightened yelp, the alakazam instinctively raised her arms 
and turned away, just as Umi&#39;s small ball of flame met the dual 
attack at its pinnacle and the three crashed into Talia, causing a 
small explosive reaction and a wave of seemingly reverse light to 
fill the room as she flew backwards end over end into a group of 
scrambling commises.  

&quot;Give it up, Troy!&quot; exclaimed Frank, looking extremely disheveled 
as he clambered back up from under a pile of pots and pans, &quot;Your 
out classed, out numbered, and out gunned!&quot;

The dark chef glared at the cop with a sudden fury. &quot;In MY 
kitchen!&quot; he shouted angrily as he reached under the counter and 
grabbed something that made an awful clicking noise, &quot;You WILL 
refer to ME as CHEF!!!&quot;

Frank&#39;s eyes widened, and he immediately dropped down behind the 
metal counter once more as Chef Troy pulled a tommy-gun out and 
began firing madly in the officer&#39;s direction.

&quot;What next?!&quot; exclaimed Misty, noticing that the commise who 
hadn&#39;t immediately fled the scene were now taking up large knives 
and frying pans before rushing to their leader&#39;s aid.

&quot;As I said, it only gets worse!&quot; answered Miranda, stepping around 
Misty as she drew her bokken in time to parry the cleaver of a 
stealthy commise who thought he could backstab her lover.

&quot;Wow,&quot; commented Misty, glancing over her shoulder in time to see 
Miranda&#39;s knee connect with the commise&#39;s groin and the man go 
down groaning, &quot;I&#39;m really going to owe you, aren&#39;t I?&quot;

&quot;Then in return we could use some more firepower!&quot; 

&quot;Well then, Miri, dear,&quot; Misty replied with a wide grin as she 
pulled out two minimized poke balls and prepared to lob them with 
all her might, &quot;I hope you&#39;ll settle for a little water power! 
Shadow! Umberlee! Save Uncle Frank!&quot;

Chef Troy ducked momentarily as several rounds from Frank&#39;s 
revolver whizzed past him and impacted with the far wall before 
leaping up once again and spraying the area, inadvertently 
wounding several of his own minions. In his excitement, however, 
he failed to notice as a pokeball enlarged itself from storage 
mode in time to bounce off his head.

&quot;Ow-! Shizen-!&quot; he exclaimed, staggering backwards as his tommy-
gun continued to fire blindly before a very large, very determined 
ten-pointed starfish landed on him, pinning the dark Chef to the 
floor.

&quot;Sal-! Salmonella!&quot; the man shouted as his tommy-gun clattered to 
the floor and he struggled with the enormous starmie, &quot;Get this 
thing off of me!&quot;

&quot;Guys!&quot; ordered Miranda as she made a flinging motion with her 
bokken to dislodge the meat cleaver, &quot;Split up and incapacitate 
anyone who&#39;s not running away! We&#39;re NOT here to cause permanent 
harm!&quot;

&quot;Even if they ARE,&quot; muttered Misty a touch bitterly as she watched 
the cleaver spin over once before sailing in an unerring line 
across the kitchen before stabbing into a cupboard door. &quot;Wow!&quot; 
she laughed, &quot;Aerodynamic!&quot;

&quot;Whatever works!&quot; commented Frank as he and Bow leapt out of 
hiding and dove over the counter to help Umberlee as Troy finally 
tossed her off on his own.

&quot;Salmonella!&quot; the chef called out, not noticing as behind him, 
Shadow began to swivel in the air, the ends of his five arms 
sending out a fine mist, &quot;Where are you!?&quot;

&quot;Probably hiding!&quot; chuckled Frank, aiming both pistols at Troy and 
motioning for the man to rise, failing to clue into the staryu&#39;s 
intent, &quot;Bow, give chase. That little pokemon&#39;s probably more 
trouble than her master.&quot;

&quot;You have no idea,&quot; Troy replied with a toothy grin as Bow yipped 
and ran off as behind the dark Chef, Shadow&#39;s spinning turned him 
into a blur before each of his five arms let loose with 
simultaneous blasts of water that spun into a spiraling jet of 
water before crashing into the dark chef&#39;s back.

With a surprised curse, Chef Troy ploughed into Frank, causing the 
officer to drop his revolvers as the two men collapsed in heap and 
Umberlee reached out with her mind.

&#39;Sleeeeeep!&#39; came the distant sound of the starmie&#39;s voice in both 
men&#39;s minds.

&quot;Overzealous, glory-hogging, overgrown starfish!&quot; grunted Frank, 
biting his tongue as hard as he could to stay awake, but finding 
to his disappointment that Chef Troy had gone unconscious.

From not far away, the act of sending Chef Troy into a deep 
slumber caused Salmonella to let out a loud angry cry of anguish. 
This was followed by the remaining commises to let loose a series 
of curses as they realized that their dark leader had fallen. 

&quot;I think we made them mad!&quot; commented Misty over the sound of 
shouting voices and running feet as her and Miranda pivoted in 
place, their backs pressed against each other.

&quot;What makes you say that?&quot; Miranda chuckled through gritted teeth, 
finding herself enjoying the adrenaline surge as swung her bokken 
in several quick, hard strokes, knocking several kitchen knives 
out of the air and causing the wooden blade to sustain several 
deep gashes.

Misty laughed as she quickly stooped to grab a fallen cast-iron 
frying pan and using it to parry an angry commise&#39;s fist before 
panting her foot firmly against his stomach and pushing him away. 

&quot;Gee!&quot; she commented, glancing over her shoulder as the woman Troy 
had been speaking to earlier chopped downward with the knife she 
held in both hands, &quot;What&#39;s that thing made of?!&quot;

Miranda grunted as she caught the blow, and grinned darkly at her 
opponent as the metal blade hit something half way through her 
bokken with a loud -clank!-. &quot;My mother&#39;s invention, actually,&quot; 
she explained in a tone both casual and hurried, &quot;Courier swords 
are reinforced with mithril. Don&#39;t tell Uncle Frank!&quot;

The courier took advantage of her opponent&#39;s surprise and grabbed 
a plastic squeeze bottle off a nearby counter before squirting the 
red liquid it contained in her face. The woman instantly let do of 
the knife, and fled the kitchen screaming as she held her face in 
both hands. 

&quot;Ooops!&quot; commented Miranda, glancing at the label as she shook the 
kitchen knife free of her weapon, &quot;&#39;Karl&#39;s Insanity Hot-Sauce. 
Caution: Avoid contact with exposed skin&#39;. Sorry, ma&#39;am!&quot; 

Misty could help laughing, even as she fought for her life against 
a sudden barrage of thrown food items tossed out by a commise 
standing near one of the now open cold storage room doors as 
desperately throwing food out of the freezer in her direction.

With gritted teeth and a grin both panicked and amused, she swung 
the frying pan about defensively, parrying a small swarm of frozen 
brussel-sprouts before the man heaved out a huge block of mint-
chocolate chip ice-cream with both hands.

&quot;Miranda!&quot; she exclaimed, uncertain of what to do as the frozen 
block of her favorite dessert suddenly came sailing towards her 
head at a dangerous speed.

Without looking back, Miranda tossed her bokken into the air, 
before reaching back linking both arms through Misty&#39;s before 
catching the bokken rather awkwardly in both hands and tossing 
herself and Misty bodily into on of the aisles. 

There was a loud -thump!- as the huge block of ice-cream hit the 
corner of a metal counter and broke in half, each chunk flying in 
a different direction as the two slid across the linoleum. 

&quot;You okay, love?&quot; inquired Miranda as she wasted no time in 
getting to her feet.

&quot;I&#39;ve had worse,&quot; assured Misty, standing with her back to Miranda 
once more, and giving a sudden start as half a block of ice-cream 
fell into her hands as an other commise came running down the 
aisle towards her.

&quot;For Chef Troy!&quot; the commise exclaimed, fanatically swinging his 
kitchen knife over his head madly as he ran.

&quot;Don&#39;t you know?&quot; laughed Misty, holding up the block of ice-cream 
as the blade came down and sank a mere inch into the frozen 
surface, &quot;Every city in history that was named Troy fell!&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; laughed Miranda as Misty raised the block and clobbered her 
opponent into unconsciousness with it, &quot;I guess it is true. A 
Ginsu CAN&#39;T cut through frozen ice-cream.&quot;

&quot;And I finally got at that ice-cream we transporting,&quot; laughed 
Misty mischievously as they both turned to face one another and 
she took a large bite of it. &quot;Wan&#39; &#39;ome?&quot; she inquired with a 
mouthful of ice-cream and a silly grin before tossing the block 
away and catching another commise in the stomach with it.

&quot;Then we shall see which is sweeter,&quot; commented Miranda, her left 
arm going about her beloved&#39;s waist finding herself unable to keep 
a straight face, &quot;Mint chocolate chip, or your kisses!&quot;

Miranda found herself laughing as Misty&#39;s now gooey fingers took 
twin handfuls of her hair, a heartbeat before their lips 
touched...

***

Elsewhere in the kitchen, Wraith hovered amongst the ensuing 
chaos, chuckling to himself as the waves of varying emotions 
filled the ethereal plane, slowly satiating his hunger. As he 
lazily floated through the melee, he laughed as thrown kitchen 
knives passed harmlessly through him and the ghost returned the 
attacks with half-hearted blasts of &#39;nightshade&#39;, which he fired 
off with a casual flick of a single finger.

&#39;Oh! So sorry!&#39; he sent to one unfortunate commise as the man fell 
to the ground convulsing as the dark light enveloped him, causing 
the unfortunately fellow to take on a sudden gaunt cast, &#39;I keep 
forgetting, you human&#39;s are &quot;weak&quot; against ghost attacks!&#39;

&quot;And ghosts are weak against darkness!&quot; hissed a sinister voice, 
before a baseball sized orb of un-light ploughed into, and 
straight through the haunter, taking a good-sized portion of his 
ephemera with it.

Wraith let out a shriek of panic as he swiveled around and spotted 
Salmonella standing atop an unconscious commise who&#39;d slumped over 
a workstation. &quot;You!&quot; he whispered, barely able to speak after the 
power of the dark-eevee&#39;s shadow bolt.

Salmonella smiled malevolently, her tiny, razor-like teeth 
gleaming as the circle of amber coloured fur upon her forehead 
glowed brightly. &quot;Yes,&quot; she replied in a sinisterly amused tone, 
&quot;I thought I smelt the delightful tang of ectoplasm in the air. 
But tell me, spirit-&quot; as the umbreon spoke, crackling black 
lightning erupted within the confines of the circle as she 
prepared a second helping of &#39;shadow-bolt&#39; &quot;-where&#39;s that 
delicious little rattata friend of yours?&quot;

&quot;Right here, soul-sucker!&quot; a voice called out, causing Salmonella 
to glance across the rift between countertops to see Nezumi, once 
more in rattata mode, standing dramatically on his haunches, 
glowing with a silvery light.

&quot;Ah, how quaint,&quot; the umbreon remarked mockingly, a ball of 
shimmering darkness melding out from within the glowing circle, 
&quot;You run to your friend&#39;s rescue so easily. Ah, how predictable 
and easily manipulated the &#39;good&#39; ones are! They all die so 
easily!&quot;

Nezumi let out a laughing exclamation of surprise as he 
sidestepped the shadow-bolt, which landed in the sink full of 
dirty dishes behind him and exploded, sending shards of glass out 
towards the dark-eevee.

&quot;Curses!&quot; she hissed, her sickly green barrier reinitializing in 
time to halt the shards in their tracks.

&quot;Say, uh, shadow-babe,&quot; chuckled Nezumi, watching as Salmonella 
lowered her barrier and the shards of glass fell to the floor, 
&quot;You ah, you look like ya got a little rattata in you. Is that 
true?&quot;

&quot;WHAT?!&quot; hissed Salmonella, her eyes glowing red with anger as 
Nezumi tried to keep from shivering in her presence, &quot;I&#39;ll have 
you know, vermin, that I was a pure strain eevee before I chose to 
embrace the darkness of my soul!&quot;

Nezumi suppressed the urge to roll his eyes; instead he 
concentrated on what he believed to be his greatest asset. His 
sarcasm. &quot;Well then,&quot; he replied as adrenaline filled his system, 
&quot;Would ya like some?&quot;

&quot;WHA-?!&quot; Salmonella exclaimed, deeply offended by the crude remark 
and unable to react as Nezumi lunged forward, leaping over the 
chasm that separated them so quickly, that all the pokemon saw was 
a purple blur. A tenth of a second later, the blur ploughed into 
the umbreon, sending her sailing over the opposite edge of the 
counter.

&quot;Curse you!&quot; she exclaimed just before landing head first in a 
garbage can as several commises ran past her, fleeing for their 
lives as loud angry roar filled the air, causing visible waves of 
sound to rattle the wastebasket until it fell over and the 
struggling umbreon came spilling out with the rest of the garbage.

&quot;What was that?&quot; she exclaimed angrily, giving her head a shake to 
dislodge the scraps of decomposing meat and rotting vegetables 
from her fur.

&quot;The righteous wrath of the just, that shall punish the wicked!&quot; 
answered Bow with a snarling growl as she stood at the far end of 
the aisle, a large piece of white cloth still hanging from her 
jaws where she&#39;d given a commise something to remember her by.

&quot;You&#39;ve GOT to be kidding me,&quot; relied Salmonella, giving the 
growlithe her best &quot;get real&quot; look.

&quot;Actually,&quot; assured Umi from the opposite end of the aisle in a 
calm, amused tone, &quot;She&#39;s quite serious. Your master tried to hurt 
Frank. Not the most intelligent of moves.&quot;

Salmonella glanced fearfully in the young dragon&#39;s direction and 
grimaced. &quot;Fine then,&quot; she said with dark determination as a 
strange greenish frothing substance began to form with her mouth, 
&quot;Then I&#39;ll just have to add dratini to tonight&#39;s menu, seeing as 
we already have growlithe!&quot;  

&quot;Bring it on!&quot; Umi hissed angrily, anticipating the sudden blast 
of bale-fire, and responding with a jet of high-pressure water as 
Bow felt no compunction against unleashing a jet of flame from 
behind...

***

Misty turned in the direction of Salmonella&#39;s sudden frightened 
scream as Miranda kneecapped the last of the commises with her 
bokken and the room was lit by a burst of green/red light before a 
cloud of steam rose from one of the aisles.

&quot;Looks like the girls work well together,&quot; she commented, wiping 
mint chocolate-chip ice-cream off her mouth as Frank got to his 
feet a short distance away, soaked through to the skin by Shadow 
and Umberlee&#39;s enthusiastic attempt to help apprehend Chef Troy, 
panting as he hefted the handcuffed, and unconscious chef up onto 
the counter.

&quot;Eh, Bow&#39;s a cop too,&quot; Frank replied as the two star-shaped 
pokemon hovered eerily behind him, watching with interest, &quot;she 
understands the concept of back up.&quot;

&quot;Unlike SOME officers, I hear,&quot; commented the amused voice of 
Irene as she entered the kitchen through the loading dock.

&quot;Irene!&quot; Misty and Miranda exclaimed in delighted surprise as 
Miranda bopped the commise on the forehead with the hilt of her 
sword, knocking the man unconscious.

The woman smiled at them maternally as she stepped forward, hardly 
seeming to notice as she hopped over an unconscious body. &quot;Sorry I 
missed all the fun, girls,&quot; she replied in a motherly tone, 
holding up the carefully wrapped package she carried, &quot;But I did 
bring cookies if anyone&#39;s interested.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, mom!&quot; Miranda laughed as Misty accepted the box and 
wasted little time opening it.

&quot;And as for, you!&quot; the woman scolded, walking towards Frank, &quot;What 
trouble have you gotten these two into now?&quot;

&quot;Uh, I- Ah...&quot; Frank stammered as Bow ran out of nowhere, her 
lacily furred tail wagging frantically as she lunged at Irene, 
barking happily, &quot;We were just um... Doing a health inspection?&quot;

Irene laughed as she knelt down to pet Bow and accept her canine 
greeting. &quot;Well,&quot; the woman replied, glancing at the unconscious 
form of Chef Troy with some satisfaction, &quot;So long as you can find 
some kind of evidence to support your claim, I suppose you could 
always say you had probable cause.&quot;

Irene gave Bow a final pat on the head and stood up, immediately 
marching towards one of the sealed cool-rooms. &quot;So, how did you 
know we were here?&quot; Miranda inquired politely, a cold chill that 
had nothing to do with temperature running through her as Irene 
yanked open the metal door.

&quot;Hey,&quot; the woman replied with a knowing smile, &quot;I&#39;m a mom! Do you 
really have to ask?&quot;

&quot;Well, um... Yeah,&quot; offered Misty a little sheepishly, finally 
having a chance to wipe her hands clean on a towel.

Irene paused, an amused smile crossing her lips. &quot;Actually, it was 
Frank,&quot; she explained, &quot;He called me and told me to meet you all 
here. Sorry I was late.&quot;

The seamstress then proceeded to pull the door open all the way 
and gave the room a thoughtful look. &quot;Ah yes,&quot; the seamstress 
pondered thoughtfully, &quot;This IS bad.&quot;

Miranda&#39;s arm went about Misty&#39;s shoulders as she turned away. 
&quot;You found the one with the... The pokemon we had in it?&quot;

Irene shook her head in dismay. &quot;No,&quot; she sighed heavily, stepping 
into the room and returning with a tray full of slightly green-
tinged eggs, &quot;These haven&#39;t been stored at a proper temperature 
and are likely to go bad. Anyone for an omelet?&quot;

&quot;The cookies are more than enough,&quot; Miranda laughed, feeling a 
little relieved as she lead Misty over to where Frank was picking 
up one of the large, strangely shaped eggs.

&quot;So, uh, what are these anyway?&quot; he asked, shuffling uncomfortably 
in his damp clothes.

&quot;Oh,&quot; said Irene thoughtfully, giving the clutch a closer 
examination, &quot;Oh dear. These are bulbasaur eggs. If they aren&#39;t 
prepared properly they&#39;re quite toxic!&quot;

&quot;Ah!&quot; exclaimed Frank, tossing the egg to Miranda in mock fear.

The courier caught it carefully in the palm of her free hand, 
laughing at her almost-uncle&#39;s antics and not noticing as the 
large, elliptical orb quivered in her hand.

&quot;Um, Miranda...&quot; warned Misty, suddenly frantically tugging at the 
courier&#39;s sleeve, &quot;I think this one&#39;s alive.&quot;

&quot;Wha-?!&quot; she exclaimed as the group glanced down at the now 
shaking egg and Miranda moved quickly to hold it in both hands as 
it threatened to drop onto the floor. 

&quot;They&#39;re replies,&quot; whispered Irene as the egg cracked, &quot;It 
probably reacted to your body-heat, deary.&quot;

Miranda could only nod slowly as a small portion of the shell 
shattered, and a strange, questioning sound was emitted from 
within the green-tinged egg. &quot;This reminds me if Umi...&quot; the 
courier whispered so quietly, that had the group not become 
perfectly still, awed by the small miracle that Miranda held in 
her hands they wouldn&#39;t have heard the gentle tone to her voice.

The baby bulbasaur within the egg made a final frustrated cry 
before pushing all four of its legs outwards, bursting its way out 
whether the egg wanted it to or not. A moment later, the small, 
bluish reptile lay exhaustedly panting, cradled in Miranda&#39;s 
hands.

&quot;It&#39;s so cute,&quot; commented Misty, reaching out to pet the tiny 
thing&#39;s head with her finger, making note of the strange dark 
brown seed that seemed stuck to the bulbasaur&#39;s back. 

&quot;Adorable,&quot; agreed Irene, glancing up at Miranda with a maternal 
smile, &quot;The question is, though, will you keep it? If you want, 
I&#39;ll raise it. My children have all left home and now I have so 
much time on my hands... Oh, what is a mother to do?&quot;

Miranda shrugged, feeling a sudden surge of guilt as she spotted 
her three pokemon staring up at her expectantly. &quot;I think,&quot; the 
courier said carefully, &quot;that I should ask them before taking on 
another little responsibility. It&#39;s only fair that they decide...&quot;

***

As Umi and Nezumi looked on, and Wraith glanced hungrily at the 
sleeping Chef Troy, noting that the man was having a particularly 
tasty nightmare, Miranda crouched down and held the exhausted 
little bulbasaur out towards them.

&quot;Hm, tough call,&quot; mutter Nezumi thoughtfully, still compulsively 
scratching himself where he&#39;d actually had to touch the umbreon, 
&quot;What&#39;cha think, Fang-Face?&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; the haunter inquired innocently, hoping that no one noticed 
his suddenly missing hand, &quot;About what?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; the rattata explained, giving the little reptile/plant 
hybrid a curious sniff and immediately determining that it was 
female, &quot;If we let Sprouts here join us, then Draco-Babe won&#39;t be 
the baby in the party anymore, now will she?&quot;

&quot;I!&quot; exclaimed Umi indignantly, immediately withdrawing her 
curious gaze from the bulbasaur and fixing Nezumi with an angry 
look, &quot;Am NOT a baby! I&#39;ll have you know that I&#39;ve survived 
fourteen horrible Winters, and I&#39;m just THIS close to evolving!&quot;

Wraith and Nezumi laughed heartily. &quot;Oh yeah right!&quot; commented 
Nezumi as the bulbasaur opened one small eye and seemed to smile 
at him, &quot;You evolve! Yeah, okay, let&#39;s see it, Draco-babe! Evolve! 
I dares ya!&quot;

Umi glowered at the rodent, her eyes shifting colour to a deep 
orange of determination. &quot;Alright then, smart-guy!&quot; she growled 
through gritted teeth, &quot;I&#39;ll show you! You just watch!&quot;

All eyes fell upon the little dragon-serpent at that moment. The 
tension in the air was palatable as Umi squeezed her luminescent 
eyes shut and held her breath as she concentrated with all her 
might.

&quot;Mmmmrrrggg!&quot; came her muffled reply, as her whole body began to 
shake violently with the exertion, &quot;Errrrg!&quot;

Nezumi quickly covered his mouth with both front paws as the 
dratini paused, took several deep breaths and tried again, 
focusing all her will as her skin began to turn an several 
unpleasant colours.

&quot;I- I can do this-!&quot; she panted at last as Nezumi fell over on his 
back laughing as Umi finally gave up and Wraith popped something 
into his mouth before looking around innocently, &quot;I... I just need 
to take a break.&quot;

&quot;Oh, give it up, babe!&quot; Nezumi laughed, flipping back over before 
walking up to the dragon and giving her a reassuring pat on the 
head as she collapsed at his feet, &quot;You can&#39;t win &#39;em all. Maybe 
next year.&quot;

&quot;Think so?&quot; Umi inquired hopefully, her eyes shifting to light 
blue as she smiled meekly up at the rattata.

&quot;Definitely,&quot; assured Nezumi, taking a moment to glance at Wraith, 
&quot;That right, Fang-Face?&quot;

Wraith, who&#39;d been surreptitiously chewing whatever was in his 
mouth, gave the rattata a startled look and quickly gave the 
thumbs up sign as he smiled nervously at Miranda.

&quot;Okay then, now that that&#39;s settled,&quot; chuckled Nezumi as he 
glanced back at the bulbasaur who seemed to be drooling a bit, 
&quot;What about Sprouts, here?&quot;

Umi gave the small creature, which barely took up half the space 
of one of Miranda&#39;s hands, let alone two, a discerning look. 
&quot;She&#39;s like me,&quot; the dragon commented with a glance up at Miranda, 
&quot;She&#39;s an orphan. At least I got to know my parents. She never 
will, though. So she&#39;s going to need a friend.&quot;

&quot;Great!&quot; grinned Nezumi mischievously as he rubbed his forepaws 
together, &quot;Then she&#39;ll need someone to show her that life isn&#39;t as 
serious and boring as SOME poke&#39;s seem to think it should be...&quot;

The rattata chuckled at Umi&#39;s glare as he glanced up at Wraith. 
&quot;And you&#39;re vote, oh &#39;le connaisseur de cauchemars&#39;?&quot;

Wraith swooped down almost threateningly, like a dark shadow bent 
on mischief and rubbed his chin thoughtfully. As the haunter 
examined the curious little creature, one of his eyes grew as the 
other shrank until the single eye took up most of his face. &quot;Hmm,&quot; 
he pondered as the bulbasaur looked at him with an amused, toothy 
grin, &quot;Very interesting...&quot;

&quot;So then,&quot; interrupted Umi impatiently, the end of her tail 
swishing back and forth as he eyes shifted to golden, &quot;Your 
decision, oh ethereal one?&quot;

Wraith&#39;s single huge eye looked up at the dratini, and immediately 
dislodged from his head, floating upwards a few inches before 
exploding with a loud -pop!- leaving the haunter with his two 
normal sized eyes once again. &quot;Yeah sure,&quot; he commented with a 
noncommittal shrug, &quot;Can&#39;t hurt.&quot;

Umi glanced at Bow, who&#39;d been silent throughout most of the 
proceedings and smiled. &quot;Any comments, friend?&quot; she asked as the 
growlithe stepped forward to sniff at the peculiar pokemon.

&quot;She smells like a salad,&quot; Bow commented, making the others, 
including Frank, laugh...

***

Umi glanced up at Miranda and nodded as Nezumi grinned toothily 
and chuckled. &quot;Alright then, that&#39;s that,&quot; the courier commented, 
standing back up and holding the bulbasaur closer to her heart, 
&quot;Look&#39;s like I&#39;m keepin&#39; her. I&#39;ll just have to think of a decent 
name...&quot;

&quot;Rattata,&quot; commented Nezumi with a smirk, that immediately caused 
Wraith to laugh so hard his eyes fell out, Umi to swat him hard 
across the face, and Miranda to turn five shades of red.

&quot;I will NOT name her THAT!&quot; Miranda exclaimed exasperatedly as she 
stared down at Nezumi in disbelief.

The rattata recovered from Umi&#39;s slap a moment later, still 
chuckling and finally and motioned towards Bow. &quot;You have an 
idea?&quot; the blushing courier inquired of the growlithe, a certain 
desperation to her tone.

Bow nodded and barked out a quick reply, causing all eyes to turn 
towards Frank.

&quot;Ivy,&quot; he said with a shrug, &quot;Bow thinks it&#39;s a good name for it.&quot;

&quot;Her,&quot; corrected Miranda with half a glare, &quot;But yeah, that&#39;ll do. 
Thanks, Bow.&quot;

The growlithe wagged her tail happily at Miranda before going to 
sit possessively upon Frank&#39;s feet as Irene gave a happy sigh. 
&quot;Well, now that that&#39;s settled,&quot; Irene commented in a slightly 
more serious tone as she handed Frank the tray of eggs, &quot;I&#39;ll just 
take a quick peek in those other storerooms. Oh, and check to make 
sure none of those other eggs are viable, okay?&quot;

&quot;Yes &#39;Mom&#39;,&quot; chuckled Frank, crouching down to show the assembled 
pokemon the tray, &quot;Anything look lively guys?&quot;

The four moved closer and sniffed at the clutch as Irene began 
systematically looking into each of the storerooms and Misty 
turned away, thankful for Miranda&#39;s arms around her.

&quot;Nothing,&quot; called Frank as Irene came out of one room shaking her 
head.

&quot;Poor chansey...&quot; the woman muttered before looking up and smiling 
grimly. &quot;Okay, dear, just set it down somewhere and find a phone. 
I think you&#39;ll find what you&#39;re looking for in these two rooms.&quot;

Irene indicated them with her hand before walking back to Miranda. 
&quot;She going to be alright?&quot; the seamstress inquired with concern as 
Misty gave a bit of a shudder and finally stood up straight.

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; she assured Irene with a determined look before 
glaring at the still unconscious form of Chef Troy, her two 
pokemon still hovering near his body, waiting for the man to wake 
up again so they could take him down again, &quot;I&#39;m just glad it 
wasn&#39;t one of them. Eating a psyduck was bad enough!&quot;

Irene nodded grimly. &quot;Well, you two had best get your pokemon 
together and get going,&quot; she told them both, &quot;Frank&#39;s calling in 
for backup... Finally. So I think you&#39;ve done all you can, and I 
don&#39;t want you two getting into trouble.&quot;

&quot;What about you?&quot; asked Miranda with concern.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m staying,&quot; chuckled Irene mischievously, &quot;Someone has to 
take the blame for this, and I don&#39;t want Frank loosing his job. 
I&#39;ll just say that I tricked him into coming here because I 
&#39;suspected&#39; something funny was going on, and oh look! Something 
was!&quot;

Misty and Miranda laughed as Ivy made a sudden unhappy sound. 
Miranda glanced down, half forgetting that she still held the 
small creature in her hand. &quot;I think she&#39;s hungry,&quot; the courier 
commented, a sudden helpless look crossing her face.

&quot;Oh, just feed her some of this for now,&quot; offered Irene, suddenly 
taking a small Ziploc bag from her coat pocket and handing it to 
Misty.

&quot;You carry pokemon food in your pocket?&quot; she inquired, 
bewilderedly accepting the small package along with the cookies.

&quot;Hey,&quot; Irene laughed, &quot;I&#39;m a mom. I have to be ready for ANY 
situation!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d kinda forgotten that particular phenomenon,&quot; Misty commented 
quietly.

&quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;m here, deary,&quot; assured Irene as Miranda gave the 
pokemon food a bit of a concern look, &quot;Something wrong?&quot;

Miranda shook her head. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she explained, &quot;I just don&#39;t 
usually trust the fake stuff after that tainted food scare we had 
a few years ago. I prefer to feed my pokemon the things they&#39;d eat 
in the wild. Or as close as possible to it anyway.&quot;

&quot;But you spoil them so often with human food that I don&#39;t think it 
matters,&quot; Misty teased; her eyes full of joy as Ivy greedily 
accepted the small soft lumps of food she offered.

&quot;Point taken,&quot; chuckled Miranda, unable and unwilling to argue the 
point.

&quot;Okay, they&#39;re on their way,&quot; called Frank as he re-entered the 
room, &quot;In about five minutes this place should be crawling with 
Pokeforce personnel.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;d better go,&quot; said Miranda, a sudden nervousness creeping down 
her spine.

&quot;Thanks for everything!&quot; Misty called over to Frank with a wave 
before thanking Irene as well.

&quot;Just go!&quot; the older woman instructed, shooing them towards the 
loading dock door door even as Misty and Miranda hastily recalled 
their pokemon, all except for Nezumi, who insisted on riding with 
Ivy in Miranda&#39;s coat pocket, &quot;You two can&#39;t afford to get in 
trouble! Now go home! I&#39;ll drop by the gym later with a few things 
for Ivy, now get!&quot;

The two laughed as they were ushered out the loading dock door, 
and soon found themselves running full tilt across the parking lot 
as the sound of police sirens filled the air. 

&quot;So, Miri!&quot; laughed Misty as they hopped over a small fence and 
cut through someone&#39;s back yard, &quot;What do you wanna do tomorrow 
night?&quot;

&#39;Same thing we do every night!&#39; laughed Nezumi in pokespeak as Ivy 
stuck her head out beside him and gave a sudden gasp of wonder, 
&#39;Try and take over the world...!&#39;</pre>
