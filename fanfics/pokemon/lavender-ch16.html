Miranda slipped off her shoes and coat at the door as her mother called out from 
elsewhere in the house. &quot;It&#39;s just me!&quot; the courier assured, walking into the 
living room and finding her mother sitting upon the couch flipping through an 
old photo album.

&quot;Hello, dear,&quot; Vivian greeted her surprised looking daughter, &quot;Laurna not need 
you for that long?&quot;

Miranda shrugged as she came in and sat down on the couch next to her mother. 
&quot;She just needed me to have Wraith spin some illusions to make the place look 
creepy,&quot; she explained with a shrug, &quot;And she needed me to make sure Misty 
didn&#39;t get lost. Having her walk into one of the lab areas would have completely 
ruined the effect.&quot;

Vivian nodded sagely, turning the page and tapping an old black and white 
picture. &quot;There,&quot; the woman said quietly, &quot;that&#39;s the place I grew up in.&quot;

Miranda glanced down at the old, rundown five storied building and wrinkled her 
nose in disgust. Even without colour, the building looked awful. The shabby, 
falling apart looking brickwork of the exterior made it seem as though the 
entire structure could collapse at any moment. The fire escape on the side of 
the building looked as though it had actually caught fire, and was leaning 
dangerously to the right, having come loose from most of its supports. And the 
small, grimy looking windows that looked in on every apartment seemed as though 
they&#39;d offer little light.

&quot;It looks horrible,&quot; Miranda said honestly.

&quot;It was,&quot; her mother replied with a nod, setting the album down on the coffee 
table, &quot;But it&#39;s where we moved after my father lost his job.&quot;

Miranda looked up at her mother so suddenly her glasses fell off and landed in 
Vivian&#39;s lap. &quot;You- I-&quot; she stammered.

Vivian smiled sadly. &quot;I know, dear,&quot; she explained, &quot;I don&#39;t like to speak of 
them. But now, now that we have a little time alone, and I see that you&#39;re 
getting your life on track, and Frank&#39;s finally willing to commit to my 
sister... Perhaps. Just maybe it&#39;s time to dispel a few old ghosts.&quot;

Miranda nodded, pushing down the selfish thoughts of Misty that the word ghosts 
invoked.

Vivian sighed, suddenly regretting that Bob had gone off on an errand and that 
she&#39;d not brewed herself a fresh pot of tea. &quot;I know that I seldom speak of him, 
Miranda,&quot; she said in a careful tone, not meeting her daughter&#39;s intent gaze, 
but instead looking across the room to the glass ornaments that sat upon the 
overly large black and white TV the family seldom used, &quot;But I must tell you. 
Your father...&quot; she paused, catching her breath and sensing the tension her 
daughter felt, &quot;He was a kinda and gentle man. He abhorred violence, for the 
most part, and he taught me what love really was.&quot;

Vivian turned to meet Miranda&#39;s gaze. The courier had yet to retrieve her 
glasses, and her stormy gray eyes seemed either on the verge of sadness of 
anger. &quot;Nicholas,&quot; Vivian continued, reining in her emotions as she always did, 
despite her daughter&#39;s sadness, &quot;He... He more than made up for my parents. I 
think it was intentional...&quot;

&quot;You almost never speak of them, mother,&quot; came Miranda&#39;s whisper quiet reply, 
somehow unable to raise her voice so that even the ticking of the clock in the 
kitchen seemed loud by comparison.

&quot;I know,&quot; her mother said distantly, thinking for a moment. 

&quot;And I know you&#39;ve said that they were... Unpleasant people.&quot;

Vivian wasn&#39;t sure whether to laugh or to cry. Instead she gazed into her 
daughter&#39;s eyes intently for a moment. &quot;I don&#39;t want to burden you with the 
details,&quot; she said carefully, &quot;but I can give you a small example of what they 
were like.&quot;

Miranda raised a suspicious eyebrow and nodded, prepared for the worst.

Vivian&#39;s right fist shot out from around her, hitting Miranda&#39;s arm with 
surprising alacrity. And though she&#39;d pulled her punch, Vivian caught her 
daughter&#39;s wince, sending a surge of guilt through her. 

&quot;They&#39;d do that from time to time,&quot; she explained, trying to keep her voice 
level, her expression blank, &quot;And they&#39;d say... Oh, Miri... They&#39;d say &#39;That was 
for nothing, now try something...&#39;&quot;

Miranda&#39;s eyes widened, the feeling of numbness she felt at the thought of such 
people having control over her mother and aunt&#39;s lives being pushed aside by a 
sudden feeling that mixed deep sadness and amazement.

&quot;I- I&#39;m sorry, dearest,&quot; said Vivian so quietly she wasn&#39;t sure she&#39;d said it as 
tears fell from her eyes and Miranda felt paralyzed, uncertain of what do, 
having never seen tears in the woman&#39;s eyes before, &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have done 
that...&quot;

&quot;Shh,&quot; whispered Miranda, forcing her arms to move at last and putting them 
around her mother sympathetically, &quot;It&#39;s alright.&quot;

&quot;NO!&quot; Vivian cried, clinging so desperately to Miranda, that the courier felt 
more helpless than she&#39;d ever felt in her life as the woman she&#39;d always thought 
of as stronger than stone, crumbled before her, &quot;No, it&#39;s not alright, Miri... 
And that&#39;s why I never raised my hand against you as a child. Why I never 
stopped you from making a lot of mistakes I should have. Why I&#39;ve never just 
arbitrarily pulled you off the Courier Crew and forced you to stay here...&quot;

&quot;Look, if you&#39;re trying to make me call you a bad mother, it&#39;s not going to 
happen,&quot; said Miranda sternly, finding it odd to have to comfort the woman the 
same way she herself had been comforted. Miranda also wondered at the fact that 
her eyes felt suddenly very dry, as though all of her tears had gone to her 
mother. &#39;I suppose one of us has to be strong,&#39; she mused inwardly, &#39;To be there 
for the other.&#39;

Vivian nodded, not caring at that moment who walked in on them at that moment. 
&quot;Your- Your father,&quot; she went on, drying her eyes with her fingers and catching 
her breath and leaned against her daughter for support, &quot;He didn&#39;t just take us 
away from all that... He saved us. Because if he hadn&#39;t have driven us out of 
town that last night, I would have finished what Viper started.&quot;

&quot;He killed my step-grandfather, didn&#39;t he?&quot; Miranda said distantly, forcing the 
thoughts from her mind as things began pieces themselves together, &quot;To help Aunt 
Laurna.&quot;

Vivian smiled. &quot;That overgrown serpent may very well have saved my sister&#39;s 
life,&quot; she replied in a tone that was both happy and sad, &quot;I don&#39;t know what she 
did to get him back after he sacrificed himself to save her, but I&#39;m glad she 
did it. Laurna lacks my strength.&quot;

&quot;Is that why you&#39;re the way you are?&quot; Miranda inquired carefully, &quot;So strong, I 
mean. For her?&quot;

Vivian nodded, her eyes feeling empty of tears once more. &quot;Yes,&quot; she said sadly, 
&quot;Only I was worse then. One of the other things your father did for me was to 
remind me that I was still a woman. Quite an accomplishment for a simple country 
boy.&quot;

Miranda smiled, chuckling quietly. 

&quot;He was my first love, you know,&quot; continued Vivian reminiscently.

&quot;I know,&quot; Miranda replied, her smile seemingly permanent as she felt a feeling 
of closeness to her mother. A feeling she hadn&#39;t felt in longer than she cared 
to remember.

Vivian laughed. &quot;I just mean... I mean that he made me feel complete back then,&quot; 
she explained, as for the first time in her life, the right words seemed 
difficult to find, &quot;And I just won&#39;t rest until my only child finds that same 
happiness.&quot;

&quot;I have, mother. I have.&quot;

Vivian&#39;s smile was more like her old self. &quot;I see,&quot; she chuckled.

&quot;Tell me, though,&quot; said Miranda, moving back but keeping a comforting arm around 
her mother, &quot;Do you approve of her?&quot;

&quot;I approve of your decision,&quot; Vivian replied sagely, her tone betraying nothing.

Miranda slipped a finger under her mother&#39;s chin and turned the woman to face 
her. &quot;That&#39;s NOT what I asked.&quot;

&quot;But it&#39;s one of the things you wanted to know,&quot; said her mother all too 
knowingly in an amused tone, her smile loving, &quot;Isn&#39;t that right dear?&quot;

&quot;I guess so.&quot;

&quot;I know so,&quot; came Vivian&#39;s softened tone once more, &quot;Look, I&#39;ll support any 
decision that you decide to make. Whatever makes you happy, even if it means I&#39;m 
never going to be a grandmother. I don&#39;t care. Or even if you don&#39;t want to 
inherit the family business. I&#39;ll understand.&quot;

Miranda smirked. &quot;By the time I inherit this,&quot; she said in an amused tone, &quot;I&#39;ll 
be very old. With hair of silver, and joints that ache to move. I&#39;ll be so frail 
and decrepit that a desk job will be more than I can handle!&quot;

Vivian laughed. &quot;I won&#39;t live THAT long!&quot;

&quot;Please don&#39;t say that, mother,&quot; said Miranda, a sudden sadness touching her 
heart at the thought of actually loosing the woman, &quot;I- I know that I don&#39;t say 
it often enough, and I know that I&#39;m never around, but... I love you, mom.&quot;

Vivian hugged her daughter. &quot;I know, dear,&quot; she said happily, &quot;And I love you 
too. Enough to forgive you for only showing up once a year, and to understand 
why it hurts you so much to be here. Everything reminds you of him, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;

Miranda nodded slowly. &quot;Yes,&quot; she admitted quietly, slipping out of her mother&#39;s 
embrace and looking forlornly down at her glasses, where they sat upon Vivian&#39;s 
lap. &#39;Her legs have gotten so thin,&#39; the courier thought sadly, reclaiming her 
spectacles so she could see properly, &#39;It must seem so unfair to her.&#39;

&quot;Mother,&quot; she inquired, &quot;May I ask you a stupid question?&quot;

Vivian sighed thoughtfully, nodding as she met her daughter&#39;s gaze.

&quot;What did they think of him? Father, I mean...&quot;

The woman was quiet for a moment, searching Miranda&#39;s eyes, knowing how high a 
pedestal she put her father upon and hating having to take the man&#39;s legend down 
a notch.

&quot;Here,&quot; said Vivian after a tense moment, taking Miranda&#39;s hand and moving it 
into her hairline, &quot;It should be right about... There.&quot;

Miranda concentrated on the feelings from her fingertips so intently, that she 
jumped in her seat when she felt it. &quot;That&#39;s what your maternal grandparents 
thought of him,&quot; said Vivian as Miranda withdrew her hand, staring almost 
horrified down at the fingers that had felt the scar upon her mother&#39;s head, &quot;My 
mother broke a bottle over my head the night she found out about him. We weren&#39;t 
even officially a couple then, and she... Well, let&#39;s just say there are some 
words that a lady should never allow into her vocabulary, but my mother called 
me each and every single one. There was just no pleasing that woman.&quot;

&quot;Oh, and before I forget,&quot; Vivian reached into her pants pocket as Miranda 
stared blankly at the space between them, her mind trying to deal with the 
information she&#39;d received, &quot;Here.&quot;

Miranda looked up and didn&#39;t immediately recognize the object that her mother 
dangled in front of her face. &quot;Oh my!&quot; she gasped, fighting off the numb feeling 
that had filled her, &quot;Is that-?&quot;

Vivian smiled as she nodded. &quot;The key to your father&#39;s diary,&quot; she said as a 
familiar face looked in from around the corner.

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; said Bob politely.

&quot;Goodness, Bob!&quot; exclaimed Miranda, nearly jumping out of her skin at the sound 
of her stepfather&#39;s voice, &quot;I didn&#39;t hear you come in!&quot;

The man smiled. &quot;I was being polite,&quot; he told her, a sudden worried look 
crossing his face, &quot;But um, if you have a minute... There&#39;s something wrong with 
my computer. And I uh, I think it&#39;s your ghost. Again.&quot;

Miranda smiled, trying not to laugh at the finality of the &quot;Again&quot;. &quot;Okay,&quot; she 
promised, &quot;I&#39;ll be there in a moment.&quot;

Bob nodded and disappeared once more.

&quot;You know,&quot; replied Vivian thoughtfully, &quot;I got a call from a Sylph Co scientist 
the other day.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah?&quot;

Vivian nodded, watching her daughter get awkwardly to her feet and cross the 
room to one of the two open archways. &quot;Yes,&quot; she explained, &quot;His name was David 
something... Said he&#39;d call back in a few days. It&#39;s not about Wraith, is it?&quot;

Miranda smiled, trying not laugh at the slightly hopeful gleam in her mother&#39;s 
eyes. &quot;No mom,&quot; she assured, finally breaking down, &quot;they don&#39;t want him back!&quot;

Her mother laughed as well and quickly added, &quot;Oh, and one last thing, dear.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

Vivian glanced at the white blouse Miranda was wearing. &quot;That looks good on 
you.&quot;

Miranda blushed, and fled from the room...</pre>
