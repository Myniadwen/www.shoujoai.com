The meal that was served at the long oaken table that sat in the center 
of the dining hall seemed almost inappropriate in comparison to the 
diner&#39;s surroundings. As the snow piled up outside the five tall arched 
windows along one wall, a warm fire blazed in one of may ancient stone 
fireplaces that warmed the Gym all through Winter&#39;s harshness. The white 
plaster walls joined the dark green of marble floor with the slightly 
vaulted ceiling and were mainly decorated with portraits of rural 
landscapes. The only other image being a nearly life sized portrait of 
Erika&#39;s GrandMother over the fireplace, the painting done soon after the 
founding of the Indigo League&#39;s third Gym when she was barely in her 
thirties. 

Miranda glanced up from the ornately decorated bowl she ate her thick 
stew from and set down one of the silver spoons that all dozen or so in 
attendance had been given to eat with. For a moment, she stared up at 
the portrait thoughtfully, chewing silently and ignoring the several 
quiet conversations that were going on around her.

&quot;I still think she looks a lot like you,&quot; the courier commented after a 
moment, regretting the uncomfortable feeling that had hung in their air 
since just after their arrival at the Gym.

Erika nodded slowly, glancing at Misty who was chatting a little too 
loudly with the girl across the table from her. &quot;You mentioned that last 
time you were here,&quot; the woman replied quietly, her eyes focusing for a 
moment on one of three silver candelabras that were set along the table 
to provide light, the Gym Leader&#39;s gaze staring thoughtfully into the 
tiny flames, &quot;but yes, it&#39;s true.&quot;

Samantha&#39;s eyes narrowed as she glanced at Erika, quickly pushing down 
any inappropriate comments. &quot;The Chef&#39;s quite outdone himself, don&#39;t you 
think, my lady?&quot; she inquired lightly, trying desperately to break the 
tension that hung over the room and made Erika more withdrawn that was 
normal.

&quot;Yes,&quot; the woman replied wistfully, stirring her stew with her spoon, 
&quot;Troy really has undone himself this time.&quot;

&quot;D- did you say &#39;Troy&#39;?&quot; came Misty&#39;s suddenly agitated voice, her head 
turning to face Erika with narrowed sea-green eyes.

Erika paused thoughtfully for a moment, smiling softly as she glanced 
up. &quot;Ah yes,&quot; she replied with a nod, &quot;I recall hearing about that 
unfortunate incident this Summer. My condolences to all concerned... 
It&#39;s really quite unfortunate how his second cousin thrice removed 
turned evil like that.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah. I forgot,&quot; Misty muttered, bowing and shaking her head in 
dismay, &quot;There&#39;s one of them in every town....&quot;

&quot;So anyway,&quot; Samantha continued, giving both guests a warm smile, &quot;how 
long are you guys in town for this time?&quot;

Miranda tapped her chin thoughtfully for a moment before reaching into 
the pocket of her polar-fleece lined jeans and yanking out a crumpled 
piece of folded paper. &quot;Um, Zack, Annah and Joshua are supposed to be 
here in a few days at most. I&#39;m hoping the storm doesn&#39;t slow them down 
too much, though.&quot;

&quot;Ooh, you guys must be transporting something really important if you&#39;re 
using that many couriers,&quot; Samantha chuckled, trying her best to keep 
the mood as light as possible.

Miranda shrugged noncommittally. &quot;We do this every year,&quot; she explained, 
&quot;Sometimes the route changes a bit, but it&#39;s nothing new.&quot;

&quot;Well, there is one thing that&#39;s different,&quot; Misty added in a 
conspirative tone, her smile mischievous as she nudged Miranda.

&quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; the courier chuckled mirthfully, &quot;Joshua&#39;s &#39;secret mission&#39;. 
He must want to go out having one last big adventure.&quot;

&quot;And one last tall tale to tell.&quot;

&quot;But this time he&#39;ll have witnesses!&quot;

Erika sighed, absently taking a mouthful of stew, hardly tasting it as 
her mind wandered once more...</pre>
