<h1>Rainbow Reminiscence (part 16 of 18)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nikolai.html">Nikolai Mirovich</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/rainbow-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>It felt a little odd to Miranda to awaken with the feeling of a warm 
naked body pressed against her, let alone two. For a moment she smiled 
to herself, snuggling against both Erika and Samantha as best she could, 
a feeling of deep self-satisfaction filling her as the courier felt a 
sense of vindication. 

&#39;Derrick never had much of an interest in holding me this way, let alone 
staying the night,&#39; Miranda thought with more mirth than bitterness. 

Opening her eyes, slanted rays of sunlight were already shining into the 
room through one of the large bay windows, and the day promised to be 
clear and pleasant if the deep blue/white blur beyond Miranda&#39;s range of 
vision was any indication.

Feeling no urge to move, and hearing only the faint sounds of the 
other&#39;s breathing, Miranda smiled, closing her eyes once more despite 
feeling quite awake. &#39;They&#39;ll probably insist that I have breakfast,&#39; 
she mused inwardly, sighing contentedly as Samantha suddenly snuggled 
closer in her slumber and Erika&#39;s fingers twitched slightly in her 
sleep, unconsciously brushing against the courier&#39;s breast, &#39;With any 
luck, though, they&#39;ll prolly stay asleep for at least another hour... I 
should be able to eat by then...&#39;

***

An hour and a half later, breakfast was served in the main dining hall. 
Though there was another for more formal or private occasions, Erika 
seemed to prefer to take her meals with the rest of her live-in students 
in the pleasantly adorned room. 

With the row of tall windows along the curving east-facing wall opened 
to the warm Spring air, the plethora of gardens that Celadon was famous 
for filled the hall with a not-unpleasant cacophony of scents, setting 
off numerous conversations speculating as to which gardens were 
responsible, and gossip as to whose would win the various competitions 
that were held every year.

As the trio entered, Miranda stiffened a bit, glancing at the darkly 
varnished hardwood floor while trying to keep her head up as she felt so 
many eyes upon them. Samantha merely grinned, waving occasionally to 
those who stopped in their conversations long enough to give their 
morning greetings as Erika serenely nodded, smiling softly to the chorus 
of well-wishers as she all but glided across the room to the head table.

As they approached, Miranda felt even more self-conscious, swallowing 
down her nervousness as they walked around the long table, somehow 
managing not to trip over the hem of her lavender kimono. 

&quot;They&#39;re just jealous,&quot; whispered Samantha as they sat down in the 
ornately carved high-backed chairs depicting coiling ivy and flowering 
vines at the long wooden table.

&quot;That doesn&#39;t help much,&quot; Miranda chuckled, stepping around Erika as the 
Gym Leader instructed her to sit at her left and several others joined 
them after greeting Erika politely.

Once the chatter had settled back into a low murmur once more, the 
kitchen staff began bringing out carts with covered plates which they 
quickly and with almost frightening efficiency issued out to all 
present. 

Miranda&#39;s eyes widened, however, as she noticed the varied dishes which 
were served, shaking her head the courier quickly realized that the 
those in the kitchen had prepared each meal individually with each 
student&#39;s preferences in mind.

&quot;You really think of everything here, don&#39;t you?&quot; said Miranda in a low, 
shaking her head in amazement the white clad group cycled in and out of 
the kitchen and one of them approached their table.

&quot;I try my best,&quot; replied Erika modestly, her mysterious emerald green 
eyes glancing in Miranda&#39;s direction as the girl glanced hesitantly at 
the covered plate she was soon offered, &quot;But I&#39;m afraid I wasn&#39;t 
entirely certain what you&#39;d appreciate the most for the first meal of 
the day so I had our chef improvise a little.&quot;

Miranda merely nodded as a simply enormous glass of orange juice was set 
down before her before the metal cover was lifted off with only a touch 
of melodrama. 

Her eyes then went wide as Miranda glanced down at the plate, inhaling 
the scent of her simple cheese and jalapeno omelet and marveling at the 
fact that her toast wasn&#39;t the slightest bit burnt. 

&quot;Your intuition never fails to astound me,&quot; the courier chuckled, 
causing Erika to shrug, a small, modest smile upon her face.

&quot;We&#39;ve had a few girls from Lavender, actually,&quot; said Erika with a touch 
of amusement, &quot;So it wasn&#39;t hard to deduce your preferences.&quot;

&quot;Sorry that we couldn&#39;t arrange to have the place haunted in time, 
though,&quot; added Samantha teasingly, making Miranda laugh into her orange 
juice.

&quot;I can do without the ghosts, actually,&quot; she assured, resisting the urge 
wipe her mouth with her sleeve and quickly taking up one of the dark 
green napkins instead, &quot;From what my aunt tells me, they can be rather 
dangerous when they wanna be.&quot;

Erika nodded thoughtfully for a moment, exchanging a quick glance with 
Samantha. &quot;Any pokemon can be dangerous given the right circumstances,&quot; 
she replied almost to herself before turning to face Miranda, causing a 
nervous smile to cross the courier&#39;s lips.

&quot;Y-Yes, I suppose-&quot; she began, stammering as Erika gave her an 
all-knowing look, the woman&#39;s eyes seeming to peer into the girl&#39;s very 
soul.

&quot;Thus I want to challenge you yet again, Miranda Lilcamp,&quot; the Gym 
Leader said in a rather formal tone, including her head slightly, 
Erika&#39;s tone becoming every so slightly embarrassed, &quot;I&#39;m afraid that 
the previous battle was unfair and cannot be entered into the record as 
a victory in my favour.&quot; 

Miranda set her fork down, staring at Erika for a moment as she tried 
desperately to stammer out a reply. &quot;Wha-? Uh, how?&quot;

Erika sighed softly, shaking her head slowly as though holding back a 
sudden harsh wave of guilt. &quot;With all the woes you carried with you into 
this city, you were in no condition to concentrate on the match,&quot; she 
said in a low tone as beside her Samantha tried to hide her grin around 
a glass of milk, &quot;It was very foolish and selfish of me to take 
advantage of your weakness and to force you into a Gym Challenge that 
you were not ready or prepared for. But now that you&#39;ve had time to 
relax, and talk about the problems that burden you so, I feel confident 
that were I to challenge you this time, that both you and your pokemon 
would live up to your full potential.&quot;

Miranda stared at Erika for a moment before remembering to close her 
mouth, and glanced over at Samantha who had suddenly taken an interest 
in something the girl to her right was saying. Turning her attention 
back to Erika, however, Miranda jumped a little in seat as she found the 
Gym Leader once more looking directly into her eyes.

&quot;Do you accept, Ms. Lilcamp?&quot; inquired Erika in a humble, yet formal 
tone.

&quot;I do indeed!&quot; agreed Miranda, grinning broadly as she gave Erika a 
quick nod, laughing as she almost lost her glasses, &quot;Any time you&#39;re 
ready, I&#39;ll be there.&quot;

Erika smiled, giving a slow nod as she returned to her own breakfast. 
&quot;Very well then,&quot; she intoned, &quot;An hour after we&#39;re done here, we&#39;ll 
meet in the arboretum.&quot;

Miranda glanced down at her plate, shaking her head at the strange 
elation she felt at getting a second chance. &#39;This isn&#39;t like me,&#39; the 
courier pondered inwardly, stealing a quick glance at her hostess, &#39;Ah 
well. It&#39;d be amusing to see the look on Joshua&#39;s face when I show him a 
Gym Badge. He&#39;d probably have to quickly come up with some story about 
why I shouldn&#39;t try for any more or something! Ah well, it&#39;ll make him 
feel good to think he&#39;s helping me out, and it&#39;ll teach him not to be so 
hard on me next time we do a job together...&#39;

&quot;Alright then!&quot; Miranda replied, grinning broadly, &quot;It&#39;s official! I&#39;m 
so there...!&quot;</pre>
