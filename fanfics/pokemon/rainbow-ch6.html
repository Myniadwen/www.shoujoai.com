Miranda pried her eyes open, managing not to scream as she tore herself 
away from the nightmare. Sitting straight up in the unfamiliar bed, the 
courier panted heavily as she ran both hands through the tangled mess of 
her hair, matted from the cold sweat that made her sheets uncomfortable 
to the touch. Reassuring herself of the fact that it was just a dream 
and catching her breath for a moment, Miranda could already feel the 
painful warmth of tears stinging her stormy gray eyes, threatening to 
spill down her cheeks.

&quot;Why?&quot; the girl sobbed, muttering rhetorically, bringing her knees up 
under her chin and hugging them to herself as she dropped her head down, 
&quot;Why did they do this to you daddy? How could they be so cruel...&quot;

A quiet knock at the door caused Miranda to glare in agitation, her eyes 
narrowing as the door to the guest room swung open without invitation 
and two of Erika&#39;s kimono clad assistants came into the room amidst a 
rapid conversation and amused smiles.

&quot;Can I help you?&quot; Miranda inquired of the two blurry images, one deep 
blue, the other an almost emerald green, trying to hide the sniffle she 
let out by wiping the both the tears sleep from her eyes.

&quot;We&#39;re here to bring you breakfast and to help you get ready for today,&quot; 
replied the one in green, her voice carrying a thick, but not completely 
incomprehensible accent.

&quot;I&#39;m not hungry,&quot; the courier replied, taking her glasses of the 
nightstand and pushing them up her nose.

The two blurs came into focus and smiled in amusement. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t be 
silly,&quot; the girl in blue laughed, her long yellow hair tied in a single 
thick braid, bringing over a silver tray laden with food, &quot;Breakfast is 
the most important meal of the day.&quot;

&quot;You have no idea how much I despise that expression,&quot; Miranda muttered, 
straightening out her nightshirt and finding the tray straddling her 
legs despite her objections.

&quot;I&#39;ll go and run your bath for you,&quot; the dark haired one in green 
replied, undaunted by the courier&#39;s morning grouchiness as she crossed 
the room and slipped into the small bathroom. 

&quot;You really should have put your hair up or something,&quot; the blond girl 
in blue commented, her tone concerned despite Miranda&#39;s irritated 
sideways glance.

&quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; the courier replied, taking up the glass of orange juice 
she&#39;d been given and letting it press against her dry lips, giving 
Miranda barest semblance of life. 

The girl in blue sighed in dismay, taking out a hairbrush before sitting 
down beside Miranda. &quot;You have such lovely hair,&quot; she replied, taking 
the long, raven black locks in her hands and trying to untangle them as 
Miranda leaned forward a little, feeling suddenly embarrassed by the 
physical contact, but making no outward protest.

&quot;Th-thanks,&quot; she stammered, sipping the juice and holding it in her 
mouth to rid herself of the unpleasant taste of morning from it.

&quot;You should really take better care of it, though,&quot; the girl continued, 
holding the courier&#39;s hair out and brushing it carefully from 
underneath, &quot;with these tangles it&#39;s probably twice as long as it 
seems.&quot;

Miranda chuckled, the sound of rushing water from the other room soon 
accompanied by the girl in green&#39;s renewed presence. &quot;Well, if you do 
get them out, and is actually twice as long, I&#39;ll just hack the last few 
inches off again with a pair of scissors,&quot; said Miranda with a shrug, 
causing both her attendants to stare back at the courier in abject 
horror, scandalized by the thought.

&quot;What? Something wrong?&quot; Miranda inquired, braving a piece of toast as 
the two shook their heads at her in dismay.

&quot;Our Lady Erika was right,&quot; the blond girl sighed heavily, her 
expression becoming glum, &quot;You do need our help.&quot;

&quot;Help?&quot;

The blue clad attendant nodded in agreement. &quot;Finish your breakfast, 
have your bath, and let us take care of the rest,&quot; she instructed, 
causing Miranda to smile at the girl&#39;s Motherly tone.

&quot;Alright, already,&quot; the courier agreed with a chuckled, &quot;bring it on...&quot;</pre>
