<h1>Meet The Parents</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sjaye.html">Sara Jaye</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;Well, here we are. My parents have always been pretty cool, so let&#39;s hope it stays that 
way,&quot; Zoey laughed.
 
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t make me nervous!&quot; Dawn clutched her girlfriend&#39;s hand tighter. &quot;What if I say 
something stupid, or they think I&#39;m a psycho lesbian rapist who corrupted their daughter, or 
they turn out to be giant people-eating Pokemon aliens?&quot;
 
Zoey rolled her eyes.
 
&quot;You watch too many bad movies, Dawn.&quot; She was nervous too, of course, but like always she 
wasn&#39;t about to let Dawn see that. &quot;Whatever happened to &#39;no need to worry&#39;?&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;ve got a good reason to worry right now!&quot;
 
They walked through the door of the large, opulent house and approached Zoey&#39;s parents, a 
normal if not eccentric-looking woman and an intimidating man.
 
&quot;Mom, Dad...I&#39;d like you to meet Dawn,&quot; Zoey said hesitantly. &quot;She&#39;s my girlfriend, and I 
met her at a contest in Jubilife.&quot;
 
They sized Dawn up, and then Zoey&#39;s father gave his daughter a disapproving stare.
 
&quot;You can&#39;t be serious.&quot;
 
&quot;Dad, I know what you&#39;re-&quot;
 
&quot;You mean to tell me you&#39;re dating Johanna&#39;s daughter all this time and you never said a 
word?!&quot; He suddenly began to laugh, which somehow scared Dawn even more. &quot;You crazy girl, 
we&#39;re used to you leaving out important stuff, but this takes the cake!&quot;
 
&quot;For land&#39;s sakes, dear, you could have warned us you were bringing a celebrity to this 
house!&quot; her mother cried. &quot;Really, Johanna&#39;s daughter. We&#39;re truly honored to meet you, 
Dawn.&quot;
 
The two girls stared nervously at each other.
 
&quot;So...it really doesn&#39;t bother you that I&#39;m dating a girl?&quot; Zoey asked.
 
&quot;Well, it&#39;s something we&#39;ll need to adjust to, that&#39;s for sure,&quot; her father said. &quot;But you 
sure picked a good one to surprise us with!&quot;
 
&quot;I...I&#39;m very pleased to meet you both,&quot; Dawn stammered. &quot;But really, I...I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not a 
cause for this kind of fuss, I&#39;m nowhere near as good at contests as my mom is!&quot;
 
&quot;Nonsense! You won the Wallace Cup, dear, that&#39;s nothing to sneeze at!&quot; Zoey&#39;s mother said. 
&quot;You two sit down, make yourselves comfortable while we get the extra futon for Zoey&#39;s 
room!&quot; She and her husband dashed off, leaving the couple to collapse onto the sofa, sighing 
with both shock and relief.
