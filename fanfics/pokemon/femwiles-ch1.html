<h1>Feminine Wiles (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/danachan.html">dana-chan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Notes: I thought, Roller Coaster needs more submissions. And 
then, I realised, that it was up to me (uh, not really) to fill the 
archive! Thus, a sweet story of... stuff. Yeah, and other things. It&#39;s 
fluff and it&#39;s going to be vaguely silly. It&#39;s going to have boys 
liking boys and girls liking girls. It&#39;s going to have *gasp* boys 
that like girls and girls that like boys! It&#39;s hopefully going to be 
fun.

Mia helped with the title. Seeing as she just rocks like that.

------------------------------------------------------------

Natsume

She surely must be the most tenacious opponent that I&#39;ll ever say I&#39;ve 
had the chance to battle. Gritting her teeth, the red head steps 
between myself and the exit, arms spread out wide. &quot;No,&quot; Kasumi says, 
shaking her head, her hair shaking freely. &quot;You&#39;re not going to 
leave.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; I grate in reply, &quot;I am. Get out of my way, Kasumi. You don&#39;t 
want me to have to kick your ass.&quot;

Kasumi just laughs and crosses her hands over her chest. &quot;As if *that* 
is possible. Sit back down, Natsume. It&#39;s not going to kill you.&quot;

She&#39;s not getting out of the way, and I really don&#39;t want to actually 
hurt her. I sigh, and then go back to the make-up table in the 
bathroom, sitting down and draping my arms over its own. &quot;I really 
don&#39;t want to do this,&quot; I tell her, and she comes back and stands 
behind me.

I can see her reflection in the mirror, and she picks up a clump of my 
hair as well as the brush, and starts to pull the bristles through. 
&quot;It&#39;s going to be fun,&quot; she says with a smile.

&quot;No, it&#39;s going to be hell,&quot; I sigh.

Kasumi rolls her eyes. &quot;You have no sense of adventure, Natsume. You 
make a very bad girl, you know.&quot;

I roll my eyes and lean back. She tsks and makes me sit forward. 
&quot;You&#39;re going to sit all over your hair.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t see why you&#39;re making me do this, Kasumi,&quot; I groan, and she 
continues to brush out my hair.

&quot;Because,&quot; she answers me, &quot;it&#39;s the chance of a lifetime. It&#39;s going 
to be so wonderful and romantic and just absolutely perfect,&quot; she 
sighs dreamily. &quot;Anyway, *everyone* is going to be there.&quot;

I sigh again. It seems to be becoming quite the past-time. &quot;No one 
that matters.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t jump to conclusions,&quot; she smirks. &quot;Erika&#39;s going to be there.&quot;

I start and jerk forward. &quot;Ouch!&quot;

Kasumi lets go of my hair and sets the brush down &quot;You okay?&quot; she 
asks, and I rub the back of my head.

&quot;Are you trying to rip me apart?&quot; I demand, and she huffs, kicking the 
back of the chair.

&quot;No, I&#39;m not.&quot; And then she smirks again, and I feel a sense of dread 
welling up inside. &quot;But it got a reaction. Maybe not the one I wanted, 
but a reaction none-the-less...&quot;

I glare at her and get up. She shakes her head and puts her hands on 
my shoulders, pushing me back down. &quot;I have no idea what you&#39;re 
talking about.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Kasumi giggles evilly. &quot;Erika. Erika, Erika, Erika,&quot; I wince 
each time she says the name, and wriggle away from her.

&quot;Stop it,&quot; I whine pathetically. Oh, Natsume, you&#39;re just working 
right into her hands... don&#39;t act like you care! Yeah, that should be 
easy enough. Of course, when I go to speak, that front falls apart.

Getting my emotions back really hasn&#39;t done much good for me...

Kasumi starts brushing my hair again. &quot;See, I know she has some effect 
on you. You&#39;d be cute together, you know.&quot;

I blush. &quot;Kasumi!&quot;

She tugs on my hair. &quot;Come on, you have to admit it. I saw you staring 
at her at the last council meeting...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re going to kill me,&quot; I moan melodramatically.

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t be such a baby. I think getting your emotions back was the 
best thing in the world, Natsume! Now, sit STILL!&quot; she commands, and I 
sit back sulking.

&quot;You&#39;re supposed to be my friend.&quot;

&quot;I am,&quot; she says, and then puts the brush down as she starts to braid 
my hair. &quot;And as your friend I want you to be happy. And if Erika 
makes you happy...&quot;

I sigh. &quot;You&#39;re pushing it, Kasumi.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, and I can push harder. So shut up and stop acting like a baby 
or I&#39;ll develop Psychic powers of my own and *kick*,&quot; she jerks on my 
hair a bit violently and I wince, &quot;*your* *ass*!&quot;

I glower at our reflections and sit out the rest of this torture. Life 
just isn&#39;t fair.

I don&#39;t want to go to this party. I don&#39;t want to see Erika. No, I do, 
but why do I have to see her in public? This just isn&#39;t fair! Everyone 
expects me to always be so calm and controlled and...

Kasumi yanks on my unfinished braid. &quot;Stop thinking that.&quot;

I blink. &quot;Eeeehhh?&quot;

She shakes her head. &quot;You don&#39;t have to be Psychic to know what&#39;s on 
your mind. Stop thinking that, Natsume. You&#39;re going to enjoy 
yourself.&quot;

Sighing, I close my eyes. This is going to be a nightmare.

But maybe, just maybe...

Kasumi lets the braid thump down against the back of the chair, and I 
tilt my head up to gaze back at her. I chew on my lower lip nervously 
for a moment before speaking, &quot;Do you think this is a good idea?&quot;

Kasumi smirks. &quot;It&#39;s more than just &#39;good&#39;, Natsume. It&#39;s going to be 
the best night of your life. Now, it&#39;s time to pick out what you&#39;re 
going to wear,&quot; she pulls me to my feet, and I stumble after her as 
she goes to the door.

&quot;You&#39;re getting more and more like your sisters everyday,&quot; I murmur, 
amazement in my voice.

Kasumi stops, and looks back at me, a dangerous glint in the depths of 
her sea-blue eyes. &quot;Say that again and I really am going to have to 
kick your ass, and then you won&#39;t get to see Erika,&quot; she says in a 
sickeningly sweet tone.

I blush again, stammering and shutting up then instead of actually 
replying. Kasumi just smirks and drags me towards my bedroom. I swear, 
this is the last time I ever let her come over to do my hair and then 
have her end up talking me into fifty-million things more than what 
I&#39;d wanted to do.

Okay... so, only one...

But that is *so* not the point.

Kasumi kicks the door shut behind us as we reach my room, and the 
plonks me down on the bed. &quot;Don&#39;t I get a choice in what I wear?&quot; I 
ask as she throws open the doors to the closet.

&quot;As if,&quot; she laughs. &quot;We don&#39;t want Erika to run screaming from 
&#39;Natsume-the-fashion-disaster&#39;, do we?&quot;

I wince, and lean back on the bed. &quot;You really *are* getting more like 
your sisters,&quot; I mutter under my breath. Thankfully she doesn&#39;t hear.

She turns around and holds out a pale violet sort of dress. Before I 
can even shake my head, she turns back around and shoves it back into 
the closet. &quot;Ooh!&quot; she squeals. &quot;This is perfect,&quot; she yanks violently 
on the hanger, and then walks over to me, clothing in hand.

&quot;Get up,&quot; she says.

I sigh, I do.

&quot;Well?&quot; she asks, holding it out to me.

I look down at short black skirt and the jade coloured blouse that she 
has pressed against me. &quot;Um, well,&quot; I murmur. The tops of the arms are 
cut off, and I have to admit that I *do* look good in it...

&quot;And I saw the cutest boots to go with it. Well?&quot;

&quot;Do you want me to look like a slut?&quot; I reply, looking at her warily.

Kasumi just rolls her eyes heavenward. &quot;As if. Try it on?&quot;

I sigh, and then nod. &quot;All right. I&#39;ll do it. But it&#39;s not going to 
look good.&quot;

&quot;Just trust me and put the clothes on,&quot; Kasumi says, exasperated. 
&quot;Okay?&quot;

I submit, because I don&#39;t feel like hearing her complaining all the 
night long. &quot;All right. All right... Now get out of here, this isn&#39;t a 
personal strip show.&quot;

I blush at the smirk that suddenly springs onto her lips. &quot;Say it and 
I&#39;ll have to see if I can make your head implode.&quot;

Kasumi just huffs. &quot;You really are no fun.&quot;

I shoo her out of the room, &quot;I&#39;m going, I&#39;m going -- sheesh!&quot;

She closes the door loudly behind her, and I put the clothes on the 
bed to strip to change. Shigeru just hasn&#39;t been a good influence on 
her... As if. I mentally cringe. Please don&#39;t tell me I&#39;m going to 
start talking like her sisters too.

------------------------------------------------------------

Kasumi

Well, who would have imagined it, I was right. Natsume tugs at the 
bottom of her skirt as if to pull it lower, and when she looks up at 
me her braid slips over her shoulder. &quot;You. I am going to kill.&quot;

&quot;But you look great,&quot; I laugh.

&quot;I don&#39;t care,&quot; she hisses through clenched teeth. &quot;This is a 
mistake.&quot;

&quot;No it&#39;s not.&quot;

::YES IT IS!!!:: her voice booms in my mind. Her eyes flash iridescent 
for a moment and then calms. When the ringing clears from my head, I 
put my hand on her shoulder.

&quot;Uh, Natsume, this isn&#39;t a mistake. You&#39;re just apprehensive because 
you&#39;re afraid of seeing Erika, and...&quot;

&quot;Well that&#39;s a big duh, you know,&quot; she sighs, and pulls away from me. 
&quot;Do we have to go in?&quot;

I nod. &quot;We went through all this trouble. And you&#39;re beautiful. 
Erika&#39;s gonna melt right into your hands.&quot;

Natsume sighs, and twists a piece of hair around her finger. &quot;You&#39;re 
prettier.&quot;

&quot;Well, I already *have* Shigeru,&quot; I state and then turn her around and 
push her away from the car up towards the hall. &quot;You&#39;re the one who&#39;s 
dressed for success.&quot;

Natsume whines plaintively. &quot;Kasumi, please...&quot;

&quot;Oh, Natsume, stop being so silly.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not being silly.&quot;

&quot;Yes you -- uh, let&#39;s not go there again. Just get inside... come on, 
it&#39;s a party! It&#39;s not gonna kill you!&quot; I sigh. &quot;Well, seeing as it&#39;s 
League sponsored, it *could*, but let&#39;s not think about that.&quot;

Natsume laughs weakly. &quot;Very funny.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; I grin, and then flash a smile at the trainer who&#39;s standing 
at the door. He&#39;s cute, with wild black hair and silky grey eyes. 
&quot;Hiya there.&quot;

Natsume mutters something under her breath. &quot;No flirting when your 
boyfriend is waiting for you inside.&quot;

I sigh and flash the guy a grin. Hey, I&#39;m allowed to look. Shigeru 
said so. Though I think it&#39;s just an excuse for us to check out guys 
together... He holds up his clipboard. &quot;Your names?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m Kasumi of the Hanada Gym, and this is your very own --&quot;

&quot;Miss Natsume, correct?&quot;

Natsume laughs. ::If my parents new people were calling me Miss... I&#39;m 
only seventeen!:: &quot;Yes, that&#39;s me,&quot; she smiles and speaks out loud.

&quot;Well, ladies, you&#39;re both on the list. Have a great time,&quot; I can 
hardly contain my glee as I grin at him again and then pull Natsume 
into the hall. &quot;See, it&#39;s going to be fun.&quot;

&quot;No it&#39;s not,&quot; Natsume mutters.

&quot;You&#39;ll perk up when you see Erika,&quot; I whisper into her ear and then 
push her away. She manages to stay upright even on the heels, and then 
turns and glares at me. &quot;You are a sadistic bitch,&quot; she grates.

I smirk. &quot;Blame it on Shigeru. He brought out the real me. Now, come 
on, let&#39;s --&quot;

&quot;Sumi-chan!&quot; I hear a familiar voice, and then a teal-haired form 
latches onto me and nearly knocks me off my feet. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s so good to 
see you!&quot; Imite squeals and kisses me on the cheek.

&quot;Imi-chan,&quot; I gasp, and the bouncy girl backs away. &quot;Took you long 
enough! What was the delay?&quot;

I shrug, then jut my finger at Natsume, who growls. &quot;Kasumi, you are 
this close to getting to know the inside of your stomach when I make 
it external...&quot;

I go to reply, and then another voice calls out of the mesh of sounds. 
&quot;Natsume!&quot;

Natsume looks like she&#39;s going to faint, and she whips her head 
around, hitting Imite in the arm with her braid as she does. &quot;Erika,&quot; 
she breathes in a whisper, while Imite rubs her arm in pain.

&quot;Let&#39;s give them some time to talk,&quot; I say, snagging Imite&#39;s hand and 
dragging her over towards the refreshments area.

&quot;Natsume&#39;s got it bad, doesn&#39;t she?&quot; Imite asks, daintily picking up a 
glass and getting herself something to drink.

I nod. &quot;Oh yeah. She definitely does.&quot;

&quot;Does what?&quot; someone else asks, and I&#39;m this close to snapping about 
invasions of privacy, when Imite squeals, &quot;Hiro-chan!&quot;

I blink, and turns round to watch her nearly glomp the blonde onto the 
ground. Hiroshi laughs, and hugs her back. &quot;We saw each other five 
minutes, ago, Imite,&quot; he says, and she squeaks and steps back.

&quot;I know. But you know what they say about blondes... you guys are just 
*so* irresistible,&quot; she finishes in a low voice, wiggling her eyebrows 
suggestively.

Hiroshi laughs again. &quot;Let&#39;s not let Tooru hear that, okay?&quot;

Imite giggles. &quot;Gotcha.&quot; She then swings her attention back to me as 
Hiroshi picks through the drinks in a, well, picky manner. &quot;So, do you 
think Natsume&#39;s going to take the plunge?&quot;

&quot;I wish,&quot; I sigh. &quot;I know it&#39;d make her happy... even just telling 
Erika, &#39;Hey, Erika, I think I love you...&#39;&quot; I sigh again. &quot;I think 
she&#39;s afraid of getting hurt by it, though. She went so long without 
emotions.. she&#39;s still got to be getting used to it.&quot;

Imite nods. &quot;I think I know what you mean. Everyone&#39;s heard about how 
much the Yamabuki city gym-leader changed... and well, love is always 
even a *bigger* change.&quot; Imite sighs and takes a drink. &quot;I wish there 
was someway to help her along. She needs all the support she can get.&quot;

&quot;No one ever told me what she did... or does... or whatever,&quot; Hiroshi 
murmurs, sucking something off of his finger. I blink.

&quot;Uh, oh...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just Natsume. She&#39;s got it bad for Erika but she needs a push 
along...&quot;

Hiroshi nods slowly, and then manages to pick up a drink that he seems 
to want to keep. &quot;But why should you butt your nose in anyway?&quot;

Imite blinks. &quot;Oh -- Hiroshi! You just don&#39;t get it, do you?&quot;

Hiroshi blinks. &quot;Get what? That Natsume and Erika really are the only 
people who can work this out... making a mess of their lack of 
relationship isn&#39;t going to help. I mean, say we do out best to set 
them up, what if it all backfires in our faces? Then where will we be? 
And think of Natsume and Erika... I mean, what if Erika doesn&#39;t even 
like Natsume?&quot;

Imite blinks, and then squeaks. &quot;That&#39;s it! Oh, Hiro-chan, that&#39;s the 
most perfect idea!!&quot;

Hiroshi goes to reply, and then stops himself a confused look on his 
face. &quot;Huh?&quot;

I second the notion. &quot;Huh?&quot;

Imite laughs and sets her cup down, rubbing her hands together. &quot;It&#39;s 
very simple. We can play matchmakers! And make sure the two of them 
see just how perfect for each other that they are!&quot;

Hiroshi blinks, almost audibly. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re suggesting 
this...&quot;

&quot;Suggesting what?&quot; Imite demands. &quot;A chance for love to bloom! This is 
our chance to share with Natsume and Erika the gift that *we* share 
with our boyfriends! We *owe* this to the world. We do!&quot;

Hiroshi blinks, and then looks at me. Imite&#39;s the first to speak.

&quot;Well, Kasumi, what do you think?&quot; she asks.

&quot;I... uh... well, I *am* happy with Shigeru... and I doubt either of 
you have problems with Tooru or Satoshi, hmm?&quot;

Imite shakes her head. &quot;Not at all.&quot;

We both look at Hiroshi. &quot;Who, me?&quot; he squeaks. &quot;Of course Satoshi and 
I have no problems. We&#39;re --&quot;

&quot;See! Then we *have* to do this.&quot; Imite pleads, her eyes shining. 
&quot;It&#39;s a challenge. It&#39;s...&quot;

::Uggghhh...::

I look up at the sound of Natsume&#39;s mental voice, and turn around. 
Natsume runs across room towards the exit. I cringe. &quot;I don&#39;t think 
this is good...&quot;

Imite grins, taking too much pleasure from this. &quot;I think the 
challenge has been accepted, then, wouldn&#39;t you say so?&quot; she asks, and 
then holds out her hand, waiting for Hiroshi and I to react. Hiroshi 
is the first to hold his hand out over hers, and then she looks at me. 
&quot;Well?&quot; she asks smugly. &quot;We could change this... for the better!&quot;

I think over it about say five seconds and then slam my hand down over 
theirs. Natsume is my friend, and I want her to be happy.

Imite laughs with glee, a wicked glint in her eyes. &quot;Operation 
FemGymShipping is underway!&quot; she exclaims, and Hiroshi sighs, leaning 
back and staring at her wide-eyed.

&quot;FemGymShipping?&quot; he asks, and I have to refrain from giggling.

&quot;Well, they&#39;re both girls, and they&#39;re both gym-leaders, and we want 
them to get into a &#39;relationship&#39;,&quot; she finishes, making quotes around 
the words.

Hiroshi just sighs again.

Snickering, I pat his arm. &quot;Hey, welcome to being one of the girls.&quot;

I think I just heard him mutter something about wanting to shoot 
himself, and then Imite giggles and yanks him out into the crowd. It&#39;s 
then, as they head to their respective boyfriends, and to layout the 
plan at hand, I realise that there *is* no actual plan...

Groaning, I head towards the exit. I&#39;m going to have to talk to 
Natsume.
