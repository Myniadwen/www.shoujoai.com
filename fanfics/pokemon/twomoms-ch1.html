<h1>Two Mommies</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ketsuban.html">Ketsuban</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Seventeen-year-old Ash Ketchum grabbed a soda from the refrigerator,
plopped onto the sofa, and flipped on the television to watch a rerun of
his battle against the Hoenn League champion, Daigo. Ever since that
victory, he&#39;d grown lazy and moved back home with his mother, and
planned to live there until he was thirty.

&quot;A-ash,&quot; Delia scolded. &quot;You know perfectly well that my -favorite- soap
opera is on right now.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know, Mom. But...&quot;

&quot;No buts.&quot; Delia grabbed the remote and changed the channel. The logo
for &quot;As the PokeWorld Turns&quot; appeared, followed by an image of a
Bulbasaur lying in a hospital bed.

&quot;Congratulations, it&#39;s an egg!&quot; a doctor said, handing an egg to the
Pokemon, who held it close to herself and glanced around suspiciously.

&quot;Romano is going to try and kill my baby...&quot;

Delia screamed something about Romano being a good guy, then composed
herself and wondered, &quot;Say, why hasn&#39;t -your- Bulbasaur had babies yet?&quot;

Ash glanced over at his Squirtle and Bulbasaur, curled up asleep
together in a corner. &quot;I dunno. Bulbasaur&#39;s the girl, right?&quot;

&quot;I think so.&quot;

&quot;After they wake up I&#39;ll take them to Professor Oak&#39;s and ask.&quot;

&quot;ROMANO!&quot; the Bulbasaur on the screen exclaimed as a shadowy Raichu
burst into the room.

---

&quot;Professor O-ak!&quot; Ash called into the laboratory. He was followed by
Pikachu, Bulbasaur, and Squirtle.

&quot;Why, hello, Ash!&quot; Oak appeared from somewhere, along with his wife,
Muk. &quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;I just realized that Bulbasaur and Squirtle have never had babies, and
I came to find out why.&quot;

Oak raised an eyebrow. &quot;Why would they have babies?&quot;

Pikachu nodded solemnly. Bulbasaur blushed, and Squirtle muttered
something in Squirtle-talk.

&quot;They&#39;ve mated a lot,&quot; Ash explained. &quot;They try to hide it, but
sometimes I peek in on them.&quot;

&quot;BULBA!&quot; Bulbasaur sank her teeth into Ash&#39;s leg. Pikachu and Squirtle
tried vainly to pull her away.

&quot;Muuuk.&quot;

&quot;Ash, I don&#39;t know how to say this, so I&#39;ll be blunt...&quot; Oak cleared
his throat. &quot;Bulbasaur and Squirtle are both female.&quot;

Ash fainted, Bulbasaur still attached to his leg.

---

When he came to, a circle of faces was looking down at him - Oak, Muk,
Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and new arrivals Gary and Tracey, who were
naked except for towels wrapped around their waists.

&quot;You okay, loser?&quot; Gary wondered.

&quot;Yeah, yeah... sorta freaked out, though...&quot; Ash shot a paranoid glance
at Bulbasaur and Squirtle. Then he saw that Bulbasaur had one Vine Whip
vine extended, and was holding Squirtle&#39;s hand.

&quot;EWW!&quot; He jumped to his feet and backed away quickly. &quot;Ew. Ew.&quot;

&quot;What &#39;ew&#39;?&quot; Tracey said. &quot;They do that all the time.&quot;

&quot;But now I know they&#39;re both girls.&quot; Ash o.O&#39;ed, and Tracey had to
restrain Gary to keep him from punching Ash.

&quot;Bulba,&quot; Bulbasaur spat.

&quot;Tle,&quot; Squirtle agreed.

&quot;While you were out,&quot; Oak spoke up, &quot;your Pokemon told me they want to
have artificial insemination.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;So they can have a baby.&quot;

&quot;B-but they&#39;d need a daddy for that!&quot;

Oak patted Ash on the shoulder. &quot;Science will be the daddy! And Pikachu
will donate his sperm.&quot;

Ash fainted again.

---

It was a week later, and Ash had brought Pikachu, Squirtle, and
Bulbasaur back to the lab for the procedure.

&quot;Okay. Firstly,&quot; said Oak, &quot;do we want the baby to be a Bulbasaur or a
Squirtle?&quot;

&quot;Ba-saur.&quot;

&quot;Squirt, squirtle!&quot;

&quot;They... can&#39;t decide,&quot; Oak told Ash as the girlfriends glared at each
other.

&quot;Pi-chu!&quot;

&quot;Saur, bulba!&quot;

&quot;Pikachu wants it to be a Pichu.&quot; A drop of swear appeared on the back
of Ash&#39;s head.

&quot;How about a Squirtasaur?&quot; Tracey suggested as he filed books onto a
shelf. All the Pokemon seemed happy with this, but Oak shook his head.

&quot;Can&#39;t be done. Look, I&#39;ll pull one out of a hat, okay?&quot; He grabbed
Ash&#39;s hat and put three slips of paper into it, then drew out...
&quot;Bulbasaur it is!&quot;

Squirtle and Pikachu pouted, but then Squirtle glanced at her mate.
Bulbasaur glanced back, and Squirtle&#39;s frown evaporated. It didn&#39;t
matter what kind of baby they would have. Either way, it would be
theirs, and beyond that did it matter if it was a Dunsparce?

And besides, this meant Squirtle wouldn&#39;t have to get pregnant. She
snickered.</pre>
