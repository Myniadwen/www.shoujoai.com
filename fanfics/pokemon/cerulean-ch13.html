<h1>Cerulean Dreams (part 13 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a>

<a href="../pokemon/cerulean-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>&quot;I still can&#39;t believe the price,&quot; said Misty for the ninth time 
as the glass doors slid open, giving them access to the Cerulean 
City Gym.

&quot;Well, she said it&#39;d be cheep,&quot; Miranda replied with a shrug, 
putting the awkward cardboard box she held on the reception desk 
and checking the time on her watch, &quot;Well, we&#39;ve got about an hour 
to get ready... Mind if I make a phone call?&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; said Misty with a shrug and a hint of mirth as she headed 
on towards the main area while Miranda reached for the phone, &quot;My 
sisters have to pay the bill, not me.&quot;

Behind her she heard Miranda&#39;s short laugh before the vid-phone 
announced that it had obtained a connection and the woman turned 
the volume down. &quot;I&#39;ll be up stairs!&quot; called Misty over her 
shoulder, half noting that Miranda waved an affirmative as her 
sisters came down the stairs.

As they often were, the three sisters were as done up as humanly 
possible, but this time, their attire was far more formal. Their 
dresses seemed more like ball gowns than simple formal wear, and 
Miranda was certain that the way they clung tightly at the waist 
as well as pushing up at the bosom was excruciatingly 
uncomfortable.

&quot;What&#39;s with the fancy get-up?&quot; inquired Misty, her intuition 
suddenly sounding an alarm.

&quot;Oh, like I can&#39;t believe we so forgot to tell you, little 
sister!&quot; laughed Violet, giving her best &quot;Oh, I&#39;m so forgetful&quot; 
pose, &quot;As Cerulean City&#39;s Gym Leaders, we received passes to the 
opening of that new restaurant! Isn&#39;t it, like, such a cool 
coincidence that we only got, like, three? But your friend there 
went and won you both passes? Pretty neat, eh?&quot;

Misty twitched a little, feeling her heart sink and suddenly using 
every once of her willpower not to simply grab the three spoiled, 
manipulative brats and toss them all head first into the pool. &#39;At 
least then they&#39;d be late,&#39; she thought sullenly. &quot;Oh, then I 
guess we&#39;ll see you there then,&quot; she replied with the false cheer 
they always ignored anyway, &quot;have fun.&quot;

&quot;Oh, but do you know what would be so, like, cool?&quot; asked Lily in 
a tone that had all the subtlety of an air strike, &quot;If we, like, 
all went together! Then we could all sit at one big table and talk 
about old times and stuff!&quot;

Misty felt her insides clench as a sudden anger threatened to 
cause her to burst. &quot;No...&quot; she said quietly through gritted 
teeth, somehow containing herself as she clenched her fists and 
almost crumpled the box containing her new dress before raising 
her voice to a yell, &quot;You are NOT ruining MY perfect evening with 
Miranda! Not now not EVER!&quot;

&quot;Oh, like chill out, Misty,&quot; commented Violet with a disapproving 
shake of her head that somehow didn&#39;t cause her overly styled dark 
hair to even so much as move.

&quot;Yeah, like we were only making a suggestion,&quot; added Daisy as Lily 
gave Miranda a friendly yet pretentious smile as she entered the 
hall, a look of concern cross the courier&#39;s face.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Miranda inquired, giving the trio a glare before 
fixing on Misty who stood shaking as she continued to fume.

&quot;Well, like bye then,&quot; commented Violet dismissively as they 
walked away, some how making the farewell seem like an accusation 
as Miranda went over and put her arms around Misty.

&quot;Anything I can do?&quot; she inquired as Misty breathed through her 
mouth, her teeth still clenched as her whole body shook.

Her lover shook her head, waiting a few moments after the main 
doors slid closed again before relaxing and leaning against her 
beloved. &quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; whispered Miranda, holding her close as 
Misty let herself cry, &quot;Whatever it is, I&#39;m here for you. Do you 
want me to call home and see if there&#39;s another courier in the 
area who might like our passes-?&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; exclaimed Misty, dropping her package and clinging to 
Miranda almost desperately. &quot;I&#39;m NOT letting them ruin this!&quot; she 
sobbed, her face pressed against Miranda&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Even if SHE 
shows up and ruins everything, at least this will still be our 
special night! And I&#39;m not letting my sisters interferer with 
that. Not now, not ever.&quot;

Miranda nodded, quickly piecing it all together. &quot;Okay,&quot; she said 
softly, gently running her fingers up and down Misty&#39;s back in 
what she hoped was a soothing manner, &quot;We have lots of time to get 
ready, let&#39;s just go upstairs and sit-down for a while.&quot;

Misty smiled the slightest bit in spite of herself as Miranda&#39;s 
fingers sought out the tense places and soothed them with a gentle 
relentlessness. &quot;Alright,&quot; she said quietly with a nod, trying to 
keep her voice level, &quot;Thank you. Oh, and one more thing, Miri.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; the courier inquired as Misty took her hand, their fingers 
intertwining.

&quot;I love you,&quot; said Misty, accentuating her words by bringing their 
joined hands to her lips and kissing Miranda&#39;s knuckles, leaving 
her beloved with a warm feeling that refused to fade even after 
they&#39;d ventured out into the coming night nearly an hour later...</pre>
