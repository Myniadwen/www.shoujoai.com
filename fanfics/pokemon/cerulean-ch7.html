<h1>Cerulean Dreams (part 7 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nikolai.html">Nikolai Mirovich</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/cerulean-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>The sun was high above, yet its rays were showing the first signs 
of weakness as the Earth began to slowly drift away from it, 
heralding the end of Summer. Throughout the park, a few people and 
most of the staff were wearing light jackets. The tourists from 
Cinnabar where easiest to spot, however, they were the ones who 
continually had to remove their Winter gloves to prove that they&#39;d 
had their hands stamped. 

But the cooler weather failed to stop most of the local population 
from showing up to the End of Summer Festival, and Misty and 
Miranda found themselves waiting in a rather long line up to get 
in.

Once at the ticket booth, Miranda paid for them both and led the 
way to the closest information booth. Behind the park 
representative, obviously paid not to look bored, was a huge map 
of the area, complete with tourist friendly large print and far 
too happy looking symbols for all the points of interest.

According to the map, the Festival used the natural lake near the 
center of Cerulean City, with the entrance to the festival at the 
South shore near the marina, which advertised a weeklong boat show 
with free admission to all festivalgoers. At the opposite end, the 
wooded parkland area at the lake&#39;s North shore was being used as a 
place for people to relax and have lunch. If one could ignore the 
omnipresent concession stands and people shouting out the days 
specials, while the rest of the End Of Summer Festival encircled 
the lake with mostly rides games on the West side, and shows and 
various game booths were confined to the East side. In the lake 
itself, however, floated the Festival organizer&#39;s huge yacht that 
served as their base of operations. It was also a convenient base 
camp for the small group of Pokeforce Officers who mostly sat in 
their motorboats looking bored as they kept an eye on things, 
waiting to back up their land bound comrades if need be. 

&quot;So, what&#39;s first on the agenda?&quot; inquired Miranda, giving Misty&#39;s 
hand a squeeze.

&quot;Well, I think we should get you signed up first,&quot; her lover 
offered, checking out the large plague with that listed off the 
times and locations of the festival&#39;s scheduled activities, &quot;We&#39;re 
fairly close to where the contest&#39;s going to be held...&quot;

&quot;And that&#39;s dangerously close to that water pokemon show their 
having in fifteen minutes,&quot; added Miranda, giving Misty a knowing 
glance.

&quot;Hey, I never said I didn&#39;t have an ulterior motive!&quot; she laughed 
in reply, suddenly grabbing hold of Miranda&#39;s arm and hugging 
herself against it, &quot;Besides, we&#39;re here to have fun, right?&quot; 

Miranda smiled, giving Misty a gentle kiss on the forehead. &quot;How 
could I possibly deny you anything?&quot; she asked rhetorically, 
&quot;Besides, I don&#39;t think they have a gyarados there, and you could 
probably teach them a few things!&quot;

&quot;Hey, I&#39;m not that good!&quot; laughed Misty, leading the way past a 
group of lost looking tourists, &quot;Besides, Professor Myria is 
always there to do a short talk about water types.&quot;

&quot;Is she Cerulean&#39;s Poke&#39; Prof?&quot; inquired Miranda as they passed 
through the gates of the marina and followed the brightly coloured 
cutouts of water pokemon that lead the way to the area they 
wanted.

&quot;Yup, our very own para-zoologist,&quot; replied Misty with a nod, 
&quot;She&#39;s the one who gave me Shadow, way back when. Although I did 
eventually manage to catch the other two types she had available 
on my own later.&quot;

&quot;The goldeen and the horsea?&quot;

Misty nodded. &quot;New trainers in Cerulean City can only choose water 
types,&quot; explained Misty as they found a good seat in the bleachers 
overlooking a cordoned off section of lake, &quot;Some people might 
call that a weakness, but I&#39;ve always thought of it as something 
to be proud of.&quot;

&quot;Lav&#39;Brats get a choice of a rattata, pidgey, or a bellsprout,&quot; 
added Miranda reminiscently.

&quot;That&#39;s an odd combination. And um, &#39;Lav&#39;Brat&#39;?&quot;

Miranda smiled reminiscently, giving Misty a sideways glance. 
&quot;That&#39;s what we started calling ourselves,&quot; she explained, shaking 
her head at the thought, &quot;Well, usually it&#39;s &#39;Lavender Brats.&#39; I 
can&#39;t even remember who started it originally, but last time I 
checked new generations of trainers from Lavender started using 
the term. It&#39;s both flattering and disturbing!&quot; 

&quot;It must be interesting to be from a small town like that,&quot; 
chuckled Misty, giving Miranda a playful nudge, &quot;I&#39;ll bet it&#39;s 
really hard to keep secrets there too.&quot;

&quot;Painfully!&quot; agreed Miranda with a laugh, &quot;Infact, Lavender&#39;s so 
small, that my aunt&#39;s our town&#39;s pokemon professor.&quot;

&quot;Wow,&quot; commented Misty, looking up at Miranda with a touch of awe, 
&quot;That must have its advantages.&quot;

&quot;Oh, sure,&quot; chuckled Miranda, &quot;If you don&#39;t mind being a guinea 
pig now and then.&quot;

&quot;She didn&#39;t make you spend the night in the Tower, did she?&quot; 
inquired Misty in a nervous tone as several people walked out onto 
the small platform at the water&#39;s edge and began releasing pokemon 
in the lake.

&quot;Goodness no!&quot; cringed Miranda, the Lav&#39;Brat&#39;s tone serious as her 
complexion paled a little, &quot;No one&#39;s THAT crazy! Well, maybe 
Zack... Oh, I see the show&#39;s about to begin.&quot;

Misty turned in time to see a smiling woman with long, dark green 
hair that was giving way to gray and emerald green eyes, partially 
hidden by glasses so huge they made Miranda&#39;s seem small by 
comparison, step out onto the stage. &quot;Hi all!&quot; she called out 
enthusiastically, waving to the group of mostly families who had 
assembled in the bleachers as the wind blew the hem of the long 
dark green dress she wore under her official looking lab coat, &quot;My 
name&#39;s Professor Myria, and this-&quot; the woman tossed a pokeball 
into the water, releasing a an ancient looking kingdra, &quot;-is 
Waterstorm!&quot; 

&quot;Hey, he evolved since last time I was here,&quot; laughed Misty over 
the applause to the crowd as Professor Myria tossed a fish to the 
suddenly very pleased looking water-type who snatched it out with 
his snoutful of razor sharp teeth.

&quot;They&#39;re allot bigger than I thought they were,&quot; commented 
Miranda, glancing over at Misty, &quot;I guess that means Poseidon&#39;s 
going to be a match for Leviathan when he grows up.&quot;

&quot;Oh, ya!&quot; laughed Misty, her sea green eyes reflecting future 
victories, &quot;I&#39;m going to show the world just what water pokemon 
are capable of. Just you wait!&quot;

Miranda put her arm around Misty, giving her half a hug. &quot;For 
forever and a day,&quot; she promised as Professor Myria stopped mid-
sentence and glanced at her watch.

&quot;Hey,&quot; she commented, sounding a little annoyed as she glanced out 
over the lake, her voice echoing as the hidden microphone caught 
every word she said, &quot;They should be here by now...&quot;

&quot;&#39;They?&#39; inquired Miranda, glancing at Misty who suddenly covered 
her face in her hands and shook her head.

&quot;I should have known...&quot; the trainer muttered, &quot;It&#39;s like an 
ancient Egyptian curse!&quot;

&quot;Say wha-?&quot; began Miranda, looking in the direction of the lake as 
a huge volume of water was rapidly displaced by large object 
rising out of it, &quot;They aren&#39;t-? That isn&#39;t-?&quot;

Misty only nodded, not even bothering to look as a huge mechanical 
tentacruel cast a long dark shadow over Professor Myria and 
Waterstorm. In response the woman, who had been standing with her 
arms crossed and her foot tapping impatiently sighed heavily and 
lifted her arms above her head with a bored look upon her face.  

&quot;Alright, already,&quot; she muttered bitterly as the four of five 
people in the crowd who began to panic were settled down by those 
who had started laughing, and two huge tentacles came down to wrap 
around the woman and her pokemon, &quot;Let&#39;s get this fiasco over 
with!&quot;

&quot;Get this over with?!&quot; came a trio of voices, the sound echoing 
strangely from within the metal monster, &quot;Whatever do you mean?&quot;

Myria sighed heavily, once more folding her arms and looking bored 
out of her tree as Waterstorm yawned widely and swished his scaly 
tail idly. &quot;Every year it&#39;s the same old thing,&quot; she chided, 
seemingly oblivious to the fact that she was suspended a dangerous 
distance above the ground, &quot;You guys build some new contraption 
that&#39;s supposed to be a pathetic attempt to resemble a water 
pokemon, and you march in here expecting all of us to just hand 
over our pokemon. Like some how the concept of being horribly out 
numbered means nothing to you! As if being surrounded by Pokeforce 
Officers wasn&#39;t a criminal deterrent-!&quot;

&quot;You know,&quot; interrupted a male voice as small hatch on top of the 
giant tentacruel opened and familiar looking figure popped out, &quot;I 
think she&#39;s right.&quot;

&quot;So what James!?&quot; exclaimed an equally familiar woman with long 
red hair, &quot;This is more than just our responsibility to our 
organization!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a tradition!&quot; added Meowth as he popped up between the two, 
&quot;And you have to admit that last year&#39;s &#39;contraption&#39; wasn&#39;t that 
half-bad.&quot;

&quot;I suppose,&quot; agreed Myria hesitantly, &quot;But kinglers are supposed 
to walk sideways. I don&#39;t really think that it was realistic to 
have it run forward like that.&quot;

&quot;Hey, we&#39;re villains!&quot; defended Jessie, as Waterstorm nodded in 
agreement with his trainer, equally serene despite their 
situation, &quot;We don&#39;t have to follow the rules!&quot;

Myria opened one eye and gave the trio a sideways glance. &quot;And 
what about the dewgong?&quot; she inquired with a hint of a smirk, &quot;Or 
the starmie that couldn&#39;t stand and fell flat on its face? Or the-
?!&quot;

&quot;Alright! Alright!&quot; the trio exclaimed, covering their ears and 
crying, &quot;We admit it, we&#39;re no good at this!&quot;

&quot;Maybe we should start paying you morons to show up and get your 
butts kicked,&quot; Professor Myria commented as she and her pokemon 
were put back down, &quot;It couldn&#39;t hurt the show. Might even bring 
in a few more people.&quot;

&quot;Hmm, that&#39;s an interesting thought,&quot; pondered James as Jessie 
smacked him hard on top of the head.

&quot;Forget about!&quot; she growled, pulling out a remote control that 
started the tentacles flailing about threateningly, &quot;Team Rocket 
doesn&#39;t do legitimate business! We&#39;re a crime syndicate, we should 
start acting like one!&quot;

&quot;But Jessie,&quot; continued James, grabbing the remote as well and 
trying to pull it away from his partner, &quot;Don&#39;t you remember what 
Professor Vlad said?&quot;

&quot;The illegal gambling is just a front?&quot; offered Meow, &quot;The real 
money&#39;s in the dry cleaning?&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t care!&quot; yelled Jessie, planting a foot against James&#39; 
chest and yanking at the remote with both hands for all she was 
worth.

&quot;Okay that&#39;s enough,&quot; commented Myria, with only mild amusement, 
&quot;Waterstorm, blizzard attack.&quot;

&quot;Wow! I&#39;ll bet Umi could learn that,&quot; commented Miranda 
thoughtfully as the enormous draconic seahorse turned his long 
snout to face the mechanical tentacruel and let loose with 
swirling blast of what appeared to be snow and hail, accompanied 
by a howling wind, &quot;But I think I&#39;d call it &#39;Cone Of Cold&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; complained Misty as she peeked out between her fingers, 
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me they were using a tentacruel this year?&quot;

&quot;They do this every year?&quot; asked Miranda, smiling in bemusement as 
she watched the swirling blast of Winter&#39;s might spread outwards 
in an ever increasing area until it enveloped most of the 
mechanical pokemon causing most of the surrounding water to freeze 
solid around it.

&quot;Every year for the last five,&quot; assured Misty as several uniformed 
Pokeforce Officers on jet skis sped onto the scene, lead by an 
Officer Jenny who seemed oblivious to the chill even though her 
uniform consisted of her hat and uniform jacket over a dark blue 
one-piece bathing suit, &quot;Fortunately, though, I&#39;ve managed to miss 
most of them.&quot;

&quot;Well, that about wraps that up,&quot; laughed Myria, turning back to 
the crowd as the Pokeforce officers tossed out ropes with 
grappling hooks on the ends that caught hold of the small ice-flow 
before towing the three wannabe criminals and their mechanical 
tentacruel off into open water.

&quot;Close, but not quite!&quot; called Meowth, laughing as he pulled out a 
second remote and hit the overly large red button that took up 
most of it.

Within an instant, a second hatch opened and a huge balloon had 
inflated. There was a loud mechanical -clank!- and part of the 
tentacruel&#39;s head detached, taking the three Rocket&#39;s with it. 

&quot;Sorry!&quot; the three called down laughing, &quot;But not today!&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ll be back,&quot; shrugged Misty warily, &quot;They always are...&quot;</pre>
