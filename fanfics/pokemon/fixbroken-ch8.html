<p>After finally making it her goal to   make Dawn love her, Zoey realized something that put a hole in her plan.   &quot;How exactly do I make her love me?&quot; Zoey asked. Ash, who   was still staring up at the night sky, blew out a puff of smoke and   replied, &quot;You need to figure that out on your own...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;BUT...BUT DIDN'T YOU SAY YOU   WOULD HELP ME?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh...right. Sorry about that,   Zoey! I sometimes like to get into character, if you will...&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey let out a disgruntled sigh and   said, &quot;Never mind that, Ash. Listen, I need to know as much about   Dawn as I can if I'm going to seduce her into loving me! ...If you really   think about it, that doesn't sound like a nice way to get a lover, does   it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the time of dinosaurs, men   fought over things as mundane as living quarters. Love is no different,   even now. We must use whatever is at our disposal to fufill our desires.   You would be wise not to forget that...&quot; Ash replied with a serious   look on his face.</p>
<p>Zoey reminded herself to keep that   in mind, although she wasn't too sure what it meant. Zoey stared at   Ash for a few moments, deciding that if she wasn't a lesbian, she would   definitely go for him. &quot;By the way,&quot; she said, &quot;What   exactly did you do to this Misty girl? I know you said you hurt her,   but how?&quot;</p>
<p>Ash was worried that he would be asked   this. Without even talking, Ash reached into his pocket and pulled out   a small picture. He handed it to Zoey and said, &quot;Look at these   picture...&quot; Zoey looked at it and immediately noticed Ash in the   picture.</p>
<p>Standing around him was a tall tan-skinned   man with slit-like eyes, a brown-haired girl with abnormally large breasts   for her age, and a small black-haired boy with glasses. Pikachu was   in the picture as well. They all had happy, smiling faces in the picture.   Zoey handed it back to Ash and asked, &quot;Okay, I saw the picture...so   what does it mean? Was that brown-haired girl...Misty?&quot;</p>
<p>Ash shook his head and replied, &quot;No.   That girl's name is May. I traveled with her and her brother Max, that   short boy with the glasses, during my adventures in Hoenn. After that,   we hadn't seen each other again until that last contest...&quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zoey realized something horrifying.   That girl...May...her face and body...it looked...it looked so similar   to...to...</p>
<p>Zoey stared into Ash's dark eyes and   whispered, &quot;That girl...she isn't the one that...that...&quot;</p>
<p>His messy hair hid ash’s eyes as   he said, &quot;Yes. Long ago, at that last contest, the gunman that   killed seven people four years ago...that was May...&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey couldn't believe it. May looked   so happy and sweet in that picture. 'What could have drove her to such   extremes?' Zoey wondered. Ash turned his face away from Zoey when he   said, &quot;It hurts just thinking about it. She killed seven people,   including her brother, and then shot herself in the face. It's...it's   horrible...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well...although you and Misty   were at the shooting, how did that ruin your relationship?&quot; Zoey   asked. She knew she was delving too deep into this, but she had to find   out more about that last contest.</p>
<p>Ash covered his face with his hands.   Through his fingers, Zoey could hear him say, &quot;Before the shooting   started, May appeared before me and...and...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And she confessed her love to   me. She told me...she told me that I was all she ever wanted...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wow. She must have been serious   about you, then...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. But I was here with Misty,   and when May kissed me, Misty had walked in and she saw us...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Ash, I'm...I'm so sorry...&quot;</p>
<p>Well, that's not even half of it! Misty   left me and I was furious with May. I hit her and screamed at her. I   was so angry at her that I didn't care once about her feelings. I just   let all of my fury out on her. After that, I left her to drown in her   guilt...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then...the shooting...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Y-Yeah. I guess...I guess May   just found no will to live after that. She had let herself get sucked   into a delusional world of grandeur and she paid the ultimate price   for it. Unfortunately, so did her little brother and several others...&quot;</p>
<p>When all was said and done, Ash wiped   his eyes and yawned. &quot;I think we better go inside. We need sleep,   especially you. Come on...&quot; Zoey nodded and silently followed him   all the way back to the apartment room.</p>
<p>For the rest of the night, a strange,   uncomfortable air of silence befell both of them... </p>
