<h1>Jetiendo (part 9 of 38)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/jetiendo-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>T.K and Kari on the other hand went back to the monastary as drunk as 
anything as they had their original clothes on when they stepped into 
the teachers room it was just dark and gloomy they threw the dress on 
the floor. They thought they got away with it however they where just 
about to leave and go to bed pretend it never happened, the lights came 
on Mr Sirou and Mr Cowell where right in front of them. 

&quot; Your secrets safe with me&quot; Mr Cowell whispered as he walked straight 
past them. MR Sirou was looking less trustful as walked past. He shut 
the lights and closed the door leaving T.K and Kari outside to go to 
bed. 

It did not seem that Ash and May where anywhere near wanting to sleep. 
They where on the gambling machines like wild. The string of success on 
roulette was extraordinary. They arrived with 10 dollars now they where 
virtually millionaires at 4 o clock in the morning they decided to leave 
knowing an awful lot of people but stinking rich. The streets where 
dangerous as they where all fighting the war to end all wars has landed 
in Jetiendo their worst fears had been realised. Shootings from a 
distance. Knives sparking from a distance, blood around every corner. 
You&#39;d have to be lucky to get past safely. Ash got shot on the leg. It 
was now May&#39;s responsibility to keep herself and Ash alive and pull him 
though the endless supply of fratricide, homicide, patricide, matricide 
and genocide to the monastary 

After reaching the monastary and in their normal clothes at five in the 
morning the skies orangey pinkie like with drops of purple and dark 
blue. May and Ash stayed at the Social area. Ash&#39;s injury was still 
there, but it&#39;s getting better. Then all they did was smile at each over 
words stuck in their throat in a good way. As rich as anything they kept 
the money in their dormitories. Then the doors opened as they where 
kissing 

&quot; Pika&quot; gasped Pikachu. Ash and May took a right distance from each 
over. Pikachu was as shocked as anything else. 

&quot; Pikachu&quot; Ash started with nothing else to say, &quot; There&#39;s something I 
need to tell you&quot; 

&quot; Pika pi pikachu (there is nothing to explain)&quot; Pikachu snapped 

As if he was very angry &quot; pika pi ka chu (I thought Misty was the one)&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s what every one thought, &quot; Ash explained &quot; but Misty&#39;s a dear 
friend my feelings for May are stronger&quot; 

Pikachu started to cry as he thought he was no longer important. 

&quot; Pika pi chu- chu pika pi pikachu pi pika... (Ash you&#39;ve been my best 
friend for so long but I&#39;m so close to you I&#39;ll leave if you want me to 
I&#39;d die.)&quot; Pikachu came to a break down. Ash came to him. 

&quot; Pikachu&quot; Ash smiled &quot; I don&#39;t want you to leave you were there since 
the beginning you where my right hand man I never wanna change that 
together forever.&quot; 

The tears stopped. Pikachu finally accepted the facts. 

Then Pikachu gasped again Ash&#39;s leg was bleeding and it was bad. The 
three where in a panic. May ran to the boy&#39;s dormitory waking Davis 
violently 

&quot; May&quot; Davis? Whispered, &quot; What&#39;s gotten into you man,&quot; as he stood up 
and yawned 

&quot; Last night&quot; May gasped&quot; Ash and I went out. We were out till four 
there was this huge fight Ash got shot in the leg we thought it would 
recover but it&#39;s bleeding fast.&quot; 

&quot; Let&#39;s go&quot; gasped Davis &quot; May where is he?&quot; 

&quot; In the social area &quot; May gasped 

&quot; Get there&quot; Davis snapped, &quot; I&#39;ll get Izzy make sure to use his 
computer graphics he&#39;ll know what to do. 

May ran out the room Davis waking up Izzy ended up waking someone else 
too someone called Willis. 

&quot; Izzy my cousin&#39;s been shot he&#39;s at the social area&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll get there straight away&quot; 

&quot; Davis&quot; Willis whispered, &quot; What&#39;s going on?&quot; 

&quot; Willis&quot; Davis said in excitement &quot; My cousins been shot and he needs 
help&quot; 

&quot; We better get there quick&quot; Willis snapped &quot; before he dies.
