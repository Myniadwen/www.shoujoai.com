<p>Zoey's eyes snapped open and she sat   up in bed, her entire naked body covered in sweat. She looked around   and saw she was still in her hotel room at Hearthrome City. Zoey also   noticed that Glameow was sleeping next to her. </p>
<p>As streaks of sunlight broke through   the window curtains, Zoey gently scratched Glameow behind the ears and   thought, 'It was just some bad memories, but I'm okay now...I'm okay...'   Deep down, however, Zoey's entire being was shaken to the core by those   old flashbacks.</p>
<p>Without even thinking, Zoey looked   at her arms. Several deep cuts had been sliced into them. Some of the   cuts were almost completely healed while others seemed fresh. Not wanting   to wake up Glameow, Zoey quietly climbed out of bed and walked into   the bathroom.</p>
<p>Once there, she looked herself over   in the mirror. Her entire body looked pale and clammy. Her breasts,   which weren't even much to begin with, even seemed to have shriveled   up. Her hair, once a bright red, now seemed to resemble a dull shade   of pink.</p>
<p>'A lot has changed...since my last   contest...' Zoey thought sheepishly. She opened up her bookbag on the   counter and pulled out a long sharp knife. With a maniacal smirk, Zoey   dug the blade deep into her skin. She clenched her teeth as she tried   not to yell out in pain as she sliced at her arms.</p>
<p>&quot;This is for the best...it's for   the best...&quot; she told herself. She dragged the knife swiftly across   her arm like the bow of a violin.</p>
<p>Zoey watched as blood spilled from   her arms and onto the floor, covering the white tiles with red crimson.   Zoey cursed under her breath and thought, 'Dammit! Now I gotta clean   that up before I leave!'</p>
<p>When she was finally done, Zoey quickly   cleaned up all the blood. As she threw away a used paper towel, she   suddenly felt light-headed. &quot;Damn, I lost too much blood...&quot;   However, she was able to quickly shake it off.</p>
<p>&quot;Meow!&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey looked over her shoulder and saw   Glameow smiling happily at her. Zoey returned the smile and returned   Glameow to its PokeBall, saying, &quot;We have a big day today, so it's   good you got a lot of rest!&quot;</p>
<p>After getting dressed and checking   out of the hotel, Zoey stepped out into the city. She took in a deep   breath and began to cross the road. Suddenly, just about halfway across   the street, she suddenly felt something heavy hit her and she was slammed   to the ground with extreme force.</p>
<p>Before losing consciousness, Zoey heard   someone cry, &quot;OH MY GOD! THAT GIRL JUST GOT HIT BY A CAR!!&quot; </p>
