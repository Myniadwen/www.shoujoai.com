<p>After about an hour of awkward silence,   the two girls had finally reached their destination: a small apartment   building positioned next to a local gym. There was all kinds of graffiti   written on it and a old hobo covered in rags was sitting by the door,   a sullen look on his face.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, here we are!&quot; Dawn   exclaimed happily, somewhat oblivious to the fact that she was living   in a run-down old building most likely filled with dirty perverts. &quot;This...is   where you live?&quot; Zoey asked. Dawn nodded and replied, &quot;It's   where I'm living for now, to be exact...&quot;</p>
<p>Once Dawn parked her car, they climbed   out and Zoey said, &quot;I just don't understand how you could be living   here! I mean, what about the money from all those contests? Didn't you-&quot;   Zoey stopped when she noticed that Dawn was shaking and there were tears   in her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;I used all the money...to pay   for my mother's operations...and her funeral...&quot; Dawn replied sadly.   Although Zoey wanted to drop it the subject to avoid any further tears,   Dawn continued to speak about it.</p>
<p>&quot;After our last contest together,   my mother...my mother began to grow ill. I wasn't sure if I truly understood   it at that time, or if I just didn't want to believe it. But deep down,   I knew...I knew she was dying. My mother always believed in me and loved   me...even when I when I just stood there and cried for what felt like   hours.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;W-When she finally passed on...I   was numb. Numb to everything. She was my only known family and now she's   gone. I don't know what to do anymore...&quot; As the blue-haired girl   broke down crying, Zoey cursed herself for bringing up the subject in   the first place.</p>
<p>Without warning, Dawn walked forward   and pulled Zoey into a hug. Zoey's entire face grew hot as Dawn cried   into her chest. Trying to calm the girl down, Zoey ran her fingers through   Dawn's hair and told her that everything was gonna be okay.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a man's voice said, &quot;Heh,   it looks like you two are getting along together...&quot; Zoey looked   up and the color drained from her face when she realized that it was   Ash Ketchum. Dawn broke off from Zoey and nervously cried, &quot;A-Ash!   W-What are you doing h-home so early?&quot;</p>
<p>Even though Zoey was a lesbian, she   had to admit Ash looked kind of hot. Not only had he grown taller and   more well-built over the years, but he had ditched his usual cap and   even let his hair grow a bit. He still had the same old smile, though.   His Pikachu was sitting on his shoulder, its usual place.</p>
<p>&quot;I decided to leave work early   today so I can see Zoey. She did just come out of the hospital and all...&quot;   he replied. He walked over to Zoey and shook her hand. He smiled and   said, &quot;It's good that you weren't badly injured.&quot; Zoey blushed   a bit and nodded.</p>
<p>Dawn noticed how Ash was staring at   Zoey and she mumbled something under her breath. Deciding to speed things   up, she said, &quot;How about we all go inside now? It would be better   to talk in there...&quot; Ash agreed and lead Zoey upstairs, leaving   Dawn to catch up.Â </p>
