The Winter wind outside rattled the window as it howled by, making 
Miranda subconsciously hold her beloved a little closer despite the 
layers of thick, warm blankets that kept the chill of the otherwise warm 
room away from them.

&quot;Can&#39;t sleep, Miri?&quot; came the soft sound of Misty&#39;s voice, sounding 
sweet and musical to the courier&#39;s ears despite being half-asleep.

&quot;Just too much on my mind, I guess,&quot; she replied, bending her legs to 
match the curve of the small form that lay before her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; said Misty softly, taking Miranda&#39;s hand and lifting it to 
her lips, &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have been so agitated at dinner this evening. It 
was rude of me.&quot;

&quot;Goodness no!&quot; Miranda chuckled, teasingly nuzzling the back of her 
lover&#39;s neck and kissing her playfully, &quot;I love that inner fire of 
yours. You aren&#39;t afraid to say what you think and that&#39;s something we 
Lav&#39;brats cherish in a partner.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah, that&#39;s right,&quot; Misty laughed softly, kissing Miranda&#39;s fingers 
affectionately, &quot;You only love me for my personality!&quot;

Miranda bowed her head, ducking under the covers before hiding her face 
against Misty&#39;s nightshirt as she laughed out her tension. &quot;Well, if 
it&#39;s any consolation,&quot; the courier assured, coming back up pushing aside 
Misty&#39;s hair with the end of her nose before playfully kissing her 
lover&#39;s neck, &quot;I think you&#39;re the most beautiful woman I&#39;ve ever laid 
eyes on.&quot;

&quot;Beautiful?&quot; inquired in a playfully speculative tone as she shuffled 
around to face her lover, &quot;I thought you said something about &#39;cute 
rocking your world&#39;?&quot;

Miranda laughed again, sliding her leg over top of Misty&#39;s as she slid 
her arms around her. &quot;Okay then,&quot; the courier conceded, &quot;Your cute in 
the daylight and beautiful in the dark.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; laughed Misty, playfully bringing her face closer to giving 
Miranda a mock angry look, &quot;I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a compliment.&quot;

Miranda smiled sheepishly, bowing her head a little and blinking up her 
beloved innocently. &quot;Hey, it&#39;s the best I can do when I&#39;m half-asleep,&quot; 
she replied meekly, soliciting a small giggling kiss upon the nose from 
Misty.

&quot;Well, I guess you&#39;ll just have to make it up to me then,&quot; Misty 
replied, sliding her arms around Miranda and holding her close.

&quot;Anything,&quot; the courier promised, her voice full of quiet sincerity as 
Misty brought her lips closer and kissed Miranda softly.

&quot;Then just tell me that you love me and hold me until I fall asleep 
again.&quot;

Miranda closed her eyes, feeling the light pressure of happy tears 
behind her eyes as she drew her beloved closer and held her almost too 
tightly. &quot;I love you, I love you, I love you,&quot; she murmured, rocking 
Misty gently in her arms, whispering the words softly into the woman&#39;s 
ear until they both fell asleep...
