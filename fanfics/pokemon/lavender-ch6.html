Miranda made gritted her teeth, making an angry/pained sound as her fist 
ploughed into the wooden pillar that held the front porch&#39;s roof up. &quot;Sorry...&quot; 
she said quietly, bowing her head as Misty&#39;s arms wrapped around her from 
behind, holding her protectively, &quot;I just find her infuriating at times.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s alright, dear. I understand,&quot; her lover replied sympathetically.

&quot;I just wish I did,&quot; Miranda replied with a bit of a laugh at the irony as she 
raised her head and glanced at the purple colour her knuckles had become.

Misty sighed, shaking her head in dismay before taking Miranda&#39;s uninjured and 
leading her over to the ancient looking front porch swing. &quot;Look, I&#39;m sure 
everything will be fine,&quot; she said, sitting Miranda down next to her, &quot;You&#39;re 
mom cares about you, and she just wants to find out a little about me before she 
submits her approval. I&#39;m not worried.&quot;

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s not that,&quot; Miranda replied, leaning back against the seat and pushing 
against the floor with her feet, &quot;I know you, dear. You&#39;re tougher than all our 
pokemon combined. So even if my mother does find some reason to disapprove of 
you, which I&#39;m confident she won&#39;t, I&#39;m sure you can handle her.&quot;

Misty smiled, giving Miranda&#39;s left hand a squeeze as she rested her head on the 
courier&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Then you&#39;re worried about your talk with Bob, then?&quot; she 
inferred, chuckling at how harmless the man seemed.

Miranda sighed heavily. &quot;It&#39;s the same thing every single year,&quot; she explained 
warily, &quot;They sit me down and have their little discussion about why don&#39;t I 
stay here? Why don&#39;t transfer over to admin? Or if I like being courier crew so 
much, why don&#39;t I just become Lavender&#39;s city-bound? Oh, Misty, I&#39;m just so sick 
of it...&quot;

&quot;Is it really so bad here?&quot; Misty inquired, closing her eyes for a moment as the 
wooden swing-seat moved back and forth, creaking on it&#39;s hinges as some distance 
behind her, the ocean waves crashed upon the rocky cliffs.

&quot;I&#39;ll show you why it&#39;s bad,&quot; Miranda replied sadly, taking several deep breaths 
as Misty opened her eyes and immediately put her arms around her, &quot;I was meaning 
to show you the place anyway, just as a point of interest. But I think it will 
prove my point. I think it&#39;ll explain everything.&quot;

&quot;The &#39;Cavern&#39;?&quot;

Miranda nodded. &quot;It&#39;s where Umi was born. Where Undine and Selece raised her 
until I was mature enough to handle having a pokemon, and she was no longer 
dependant on her parents. The place where my parents were married, and the place 
where my father died... I haven&#39;t been there since before I left home.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot;

Miranda glanced over at Misty, her eyes feeling dry despite sadness. &quot;Sorry, 
dearest,&quot; the courier apologized, &quot;I don&#39;t mean to depress you.&quot; 

&quot;No, no, no,&quot; whispered Misty with a warm smile as her hand caressed Miranda&#39;s 
cheek, &quot;It&#39;s alright. I want to see this place. I know it&#39;s upsetting, and I 
know you&#39;re probably going to have a rough time of it when we get there. So, as 
promised, I want to be there for you. You&#39;re not alone, Miri. Not anymore. I&#39;ve 
chosen to share my life with you, and that includes sadness as well as laughter. 
Now come on, let&#39;s face the past together, shall we?&quot;

Miranda&#39;s smile was sad, and her heart felt as though it would burst as she 
looked into her lover&#39;s eyes and kissed her hand affectionately. &quot;Yes, let&#39;s,&quot; 
the courier replied in a quiet tone as their feet halted the gentle creaking of 
the swing&#39;s motion, &quot;It&#39;ll do me good to put a few metaphorical ghosts to rest.&quot;

&quot;So long as they&#39;re only metaphorical,&quot; teased Misty as they made their way down 
off the porch.

&quot;They wouldn&#39;t dare enter the Cavern,&quot; assured Miranda with a sudden bemused 
smile.

&quot;Oh? Why&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;Two reasons, actually. First of all, the cliffs have a halfway decent mithril 
content, which repels ghosts, and the second is the same reason why Wraith&#39;s 
never messed with my father&#39;s car,&quot; she explained, &quot;Their all afraid of my 
mom...!&quot;</pre>
