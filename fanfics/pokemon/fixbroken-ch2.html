<p><em>Blood...</em></p>
<p><em>All I can smell is blood...</em></p>
<p><em>God...why does it hurt so much?</em></p>
<p><em>Why does everything have to hurt?</em></p>
<p><em>Why...Why couldn't my father accept   me for who I am?</em></p>
<p><em>Why can't he accept...that I like   girls? Especially that girl named...</em> <br />
</p>
<p>Slowly, Zoey's eyes began to open.   Suddenly, she felt a unbelievable rush of pain throughout her entire   body. She tried to keep from screaming out, but she couldn't help it. </p>
<p>&quot;GAAAAHHH!! HOLY FUCK, THAT HURTS!!&quot;</p>
<p>Within minutes, two nurses and a thin-looking   doctor ran into the room with worried looks on their faces. 'Wait...I'm   in...the hospital?' Zoey realized. She looked around and saw that she   was hooked up to several machines in a big white bed.</p>
<p>&quot;It's good to see that you're   awake at least,&quot; said the doctor. He had a wrinkled, old face that   seemed to sag with age. Once the pain had subsided, Zoey sat up in bed   and asked, &quot;W-What's going on? Why am I in the hospital?&quot;</p>
<p>The doctor checked Zoey's pulse for   a moment before replying, &quot;You got hit by a car, I'm afraid. Luckily,   you didn't have any life-threatening injuries...&quot; Zoey tried to   remember about getting hit, but the whole morning felt like a blur.   She laid back down in bed and thought, 'God, my head hurts so much...'</p>
<p>&quot;You had lost a lot of blood,   though. It was fortunate that she brought you here in time before anything   serious happened...&quot; continued the doctor. This got Zoey's interest.   &quot;A girl brought me here?&quot; She asked, &quot;Did she say what   her name was?&quot;</p>
<p>The doctor pulled a small clipboard   out of his coat pocket and looked over it a few times. &quot;I think   she said her name was 'Dawn'...&quot; he finally said.</p>
<p>Zoey suddenly felt like the world stopped   moving. &quot;Dawn...Dawn saved me?&quot; she muttered quietly.</p>
<p>The doctor nodded and replied, &quot;She   was really intent on saving you. She actually picked you up and carried   you here, despite being covered in blood. She even stayed overnight   while waiting for you to recover...&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey just couldn't believe it. She   gripped the sides of the bed tightly as she thought, 'Oh God...why did   it have to be her? Why? Why did she have to come back into my life?   Why couldn't she leave me alone already?'</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a knock on the   door. One of the nurses turned around and opened the door. Zoey could   feel her heart beat quicken when she saw Dawn walk into the room. Zoey   blushed and thought, 'Oh my god...she's beautiful...'</p>
<p>During those few years after their   last contest together, Zoey realized that while she had fallen, Dawn   had risen to new heights. Dawn's long dark-blue hair was just as shiny   and clean as it was the first time they met. Her eyes were the same   as well. Her body, however, was a different story.</p>
<p>Zoey guessed that Dawn was probably   somewhere between a B-cup and C-cup by now. Her hips and ass seemed   to have filled out a bit, as well. &quot;OH, ZOEY! YOU'RE AWAKE! I'M   SO GLAD YOU'RE OKAY!&quot; Dawn cried as she ran over and pulled Zoey   into a hug. As their breasts rubbed slightly against each other, a small   trail of blood trickled out of Zoey's nostrils.</p>
<p>The doctor pulled Dawn back and said,   &quot;I'm sorry, Miss, but I would request that you refrain from putting   too much physical pressure on her. She still needs to heal...&quot;   Dawn grinned sheepishly and exclaimed, &quot;Oh, yeah! You're right!   Sorry about that!&quot; Zoey just smiled in response, her heart still   pounding from that hug.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I'll leave you two love   birds alone now!&quot; the doctor said as he and the two nurses left.   Although they knew he was joking, both girls' faces flushed red when   he said that. After a few minutes, Dawn finally said, &quot;It's...   really good to see you again, Zoey. I haven't seen you since that last   contest...&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey nodded and replied, &quot;Yeah.   You look like you've done pretty well for yourself since then...&quot;   Dawn smiled and Zoey noticed even her teeth look beautiful. Not wanting   to fill her head with any more ideas, Zoey turned her gaze away.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Dawn got up and said, &quot;Well,   I'm sorry to leave so soon, but I need to get back to my apartment downtown.   I need to clean up and take care of Pikachu...&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey looked up at the other girl and   asked, &quot;You have a Pikachu now?&quot; 'Why does that pokemon remind   me of someone? Someone I knew...' Zoey wondered.</p>
<p>Dawn shook her head and said something   that made Zoey feel like her heart just broke in half.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not my Pikachu. It's Ash's.   We're living together now and he's at work today...&quot; </p>
