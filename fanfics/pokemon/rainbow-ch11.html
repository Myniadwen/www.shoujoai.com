<h1>Rainbow Reminiscence (part 11 of 18)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nikolai.html">Nikolai Mirovich</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/rainbow-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>The afternoon sun was surprisingly warm and had long since evaporated 
the roadside puddles on their way to the Celadon Department Store. The 
impressive, thirty story building took up several city blocks and 
included such unmall-like things as a wave pool and a small amusement 
park. It also had the reputation of having anything anyone could 
conceivably want to buy. The problem, of course, being that all of the 
Celadon Department Store&#39;s prices were 20% higher than anywhere else in 
all of Kanto.

As the double glass doors slid open for the seemingly continuously 
chatting group, Miranda glanced about herself for the thousandth time, 
feeling dreadfully self-conscious in the newly made kimono Erika had 
given her. The courier had been half-hoping that the Gym Leader would 
have forgotten about it, and just given the girl her clothes old back, 
but Miranda&#39;s luck just wasn&#39;t running in that direction. 

It did make the girl feel better, though, that the others in their group 
were dressed similarly, only in far brighter colours than the vaguely 
embarrassing lavender and midnight purple kimono she&#39;d been made to 
wear. And with so many people all wearing the same, archaic clothing, it 
made Miranda feel as though she didn&#39;t stand out as much.

&#39;They&#39;ll remember the group, not the individuals,&#39; the girl assured 
herself, half-expecting to see a fellow courier at any moment leap out 
of nowhere and make a scene. &#39;Anyone but Zachary,&#39; Miranda wished 
silently, &#39;or worse. Joshua. He&#39;ll tell my Mother and she&#39;ll want 
pictures!&#39;

Miranda&#39;s reverie was interrupted as the group began their ascent of an 
escalator that would take them up three floors at once from the crowded 
main floor. &quot;Where&#39;re we going, anyway?&quot; she inquired, clutching the 
moving handrail as she leaned forward to speak to Samantha.

&quot;You&#39;ll see,&quot; the woman chuckled, glancing over her shoulder and smiling 
mischievously as she glanced out through her long wavy bangs.

&quot;That&#39;s not terribly reassuring,&quot; the courier muttered, shaking her head 
and staring down at he impossible distance beneath them where far below 
a crowd of people were clogging the entrance to a record store.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; assured the girl just behind her, and as Miranda turned 
she recognized her as one of the two that had woken her up that morning, 
&quot;Lady Erika usually comes here first to be ahead of the after work 
crowd, but after that we&#39;ll be hitting a bunch more &#39;normal&#39; stores.&quot;

&quot;N-normal?&quot; the courier inquired, turning her worried expression back to 
Samantha who was following Erika as she glided off the escalator, her 
posture making it seem as though the woman were floating through the sea 
of people who parted almost unconsciously to make way for her group, 
&quot;Just what have I gotten myself into here, exactly?&quot;

&quot;Nothing too scandalous,&quot; said both girls from that morning, whom 
Miranda realized she hadn&#39;t inquired the names of yet, in unison, &quot;don&#39;t 
worry, it&#39;s kinda fun.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m in trouble, aren&#39;t I?&quot; Miranda gulped rhetorically as she found 
both the green and blue kimono clad apprentices linking their arms 
through hers, leading the lagging courier in Erika&#39;s wake.

The store they took her to seemed innocuous enough form the outside, 
with dark red velvet curtains obscuring the interior just inside the 
sliding glass doors that most stores put in place when they were closed. 
This one, however, was obviously open, with a laughing couple coming 
through the beaded curtain that blocked the doorway as Erika approached.

The sign above the shop was almost as subdued as the storefront, with 
the simple phrase &quot;Lady Angelique&#39;s&quot; written in a curving, overly 
stylized font and surrounded by the twisting stems of budding rose 
bushes.

&quot;In you go!&quot; laughed the girl with the long braided yellow hair as the 
two pushed the courier through the beaded curtain after Erika and 
Samantha.

Miranda&#39;s yelp of protest caught in her throat as she entered what for a 
moment felt like another world. The air in the shop was almost 
subliminally scented with pleasant, flowery smelling incense, and the 
room was lit soft white lighting, which seemed a pleasant change from 
the harsh fluorescent bulbs that lit the rest of the mall. But it was 
the products that Lady Angelique&#39;s sold which caused the courier&#39;s 
cheeks to fare red and her breath to catch in her throat.

Placed tastefully along lengthy glass display shelves were an 
apothecary&#39;s worth of crystal decanters of all shapes, sizes and 
colours. They were all carefully labeled with little tags, which were 
affixed to the products by small, thin bits of string. The dark script 
upon the labels was written in a clear, concise handwriting, which was 
no less dramatic for its simplicity. The labels gave the names and 
surprisingly modest prices of the various oils and lotions, as well as 
extolling their virtues and giving a few ideas as to how they should be 
properly used.

Farther into the store, the courier caught glimpses of specially 
designed display case/shelving units where the variety of far more 
&#39;adult&#39; products seemed to her to blend into one large collogue of 
multiple colours and shapes. Amongst the more or less phallic objects 
were strings of beads, peculiar egg shaped devices attached by thin 
cables to remote switches as well as peculiar rings of all sizes and 
colours.

Miranda turned away quickly, feeling her glasses fog up as the rest of 
her group to divided up, abandoning her in the midst of it all as they 
each headed for a different section of the store. Miranda herself 
glanced hesitantly to her right, and smiled as she found an 
interestingly designed series of glass shelves, made into a spiraling 
ascending staircase of sorts. 

Upon each of the little round shelves were a plethora of scented and 
simply colourful candles, and the girl smiled as she picked up one 
carved to look like an eight-pointed star. Miranda inhaled deeply and 
let out a long, slow sigh of contentment as the sweet scent of vanilla 
filled her lungs before setting it down again and ran her fingers along 
several others, each more colourful and more beautifully sculpted than 
the last.

But as Miranda&#39;s fingers caressed one upon the top shelf, her distracted 
eyes shifted back to it, unable to accept what her fingertips told her. 
The courier blinked as she stared at the beautifully designed, 
spectacularly crafted figurine the candle had been made into. Its 
features were perfect, a replica so exact that it seemed as though the 
model in question had been shrunken down and turned to wax, only to be 
put up for display and sale.

Miranda turned away blushing, only to immediately spot Erika talking to 
a slightly older woman behind the front counter, causing the girl&#39;s 
pulse to race with conflicting feelings. Instead, she turned back to the 
statuette/candle depiction of Erika herself. The likeness was beyond 
remarkable, with the same facial contours, the same all knowing eyes, 
enigmatic mischievous smile, and neatly trimmed hair that fell almost, 
but not quite to her shoulders.

But it was the statuette&#39;s pose that caused Miranda actual distress. The 
small figure of Erika was standing tall, confidently with her chin held 
up just a little, and her chest held out proudly. The kimono the candle 
wore, however, had been opened, and was in the process of falling back, 
sliding off the perfectly proportioned arms as the figurine stepped 
elegantly away and out of it, her naked right leg stepping forwards with 
both timid grace and a confident stride, somehow merged as one. It was 
exactly like Erika in every way, except that the figurine was nearly 
stark naked.

Miranda quickly shut her eyes as she found her glaze casting quickly up 
to the small, perfectly formed breasts which sat high upon the candle 
woman&#39;s chest, and bit her lip to resist the temptation to move closer 
and inhale to see if the candle was even scented with the subtle lilac 
perfume that Erika favoured. Instead she set it down carefully, took a 
deep slow breath, and turned around.

The courier then practically jumped out of her skin, though, as she 
stared back at the real Erika, who had moved silently as always to stand 
directly behind her. &quot;Erika!&quot; Miranda squeaked out, cringing as the 
glass display rattled, causing the woman&#39;s smile to grow slightly wider.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, deary,&quot; the Gym Leader replied, placing a gentle hand upon 
Miranda&#39;s shoulder to steady her, &quot;I was just wondering if perhaps you&#39;d 
found something you liked?&quot;

Miranda swallowed hard, glancing to one side to avoid Erika&#39;s gaze, 
wishing that the warmth of her cheeks would subside before catching 
glimpse a of the store&#39;s movie section and instantly forgetting what she 
was going to say. &quot;Well, I-&quot; the courier stammered, feeling panic rise 
within her as Erika stood upon her toes to see over the girl&#39;s shoulder, 
&quot;No... That is, I-&quot;

&quot;Oh, I see you&#39;ve found it,&quot; said Erika nonchalantly, her slender arm 
easily reaching around Miranda even as the courier tilted purposely to 
impede her, and picking up the candle, &quot;You know, Samantha made the mold 
for these a few months ago. Apparently they&#39;re selling quite well.&quot;

Miranda blinked, gulping as her hostess held the wax statuette fondly, 
cradling it carefully in her delicate seeming hands. &quot;You... You don&#39;t 
find it embarrassing at all?&quot; the courier inquired, breaking Erika&#39;s 
reverie and causing her to give a short, musical laugh.

&quot;Goodness no!&quot; the woman assured, smiling into Miranda&#39;s eyes as 
Samantha approached them from the line-up where the others were paying 
for their purchases, &quot;to be honest, the people who own these candles 
tend to be more embarrassed about meeting me, than I about them.&quot;

&quot;Gives us something of an advantage,&quot; Samantha added slyly, giving 
Miranda a wink as she slid her arms around her mentor, kissing the side 
of Erika&#39;s neck and soliciting a small, contented sigh from the woman.

&quot;Yes, I suppose there is that as well,&quot; Erika conceded, her mysterious 
emerald eyes fluttering closed for a moment as she held Samantha&#39;s arms 
against her, linking fingers with her apprentice, &quot;But I like them more 
for their artistic value.&quot;

&quot;They, they&#39;re really quite something,&quot; Miranda managed, smiling weakly 
at the seemingly amused expression Samantha gave her, still wondering if 
the woman was jealous of Erika&#39;s earlier advances, &quot;You did a really 
good job on them.&quot;

Samantha shrugged, blushing slightly as Erika set the candle back down 
as the other girls began to assemble behind them. &quot;I suppose it was just 
a labour of lust, I guess,&quot; the red haired woman replied with a chuckle, 
making Erika bow her head slightly to hide her amusement.

&quot;So, shall we go then?&quot; the Gym Leader inquired semi-rhetorically, 
looking up at Miranda for a moment with a curious expression before 
glancing over her shoulder at her students, &quot;We still have much to do 
today.&quot;

Her apprentice smirked as Erika stepped past Miranda and passed back 
through the beaded curtain. &quot;If you want one,&quot; Samantha said slyly, 
glancing sideways at the courier and making her blush, &quot;I have a few 
back at the Gym. What&#39;s your fav&#39; colour?&quot;

&quot;Oh, look at the time!&quot; said Miranda briskly, desperate for a change of 
subject, half glancing at the watch she wasn&#39;t actually wearing that day 
before making for the door almost too quickly just ahead of the rest of 
the group.
