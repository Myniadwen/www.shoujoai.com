<p>&quot;Excuse me? Ma'am, please wake   up...&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey slowly opened her eyes and saw   the doctor standing over her. &quot;Ugh...what is it now?&quot; Zoey   groaned, her eyelids still heavy. The doctor smiled and exclaimed, &quot;Sorry   to have awoke you, but I am happy to inform you that you are healed   enough to leave the hospital!&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey sat up in bed and asked, &quot;R-Really?   But...my injuries...&quot; &quot;Besides losing some blood and suffering   a small head injury, you're pretty fine...&quot; replied the doctor.   Zoey nodded in response. Suddenly, she realized she had nowhere to go.</p>
<p>&quot;Where will I go...&quot; she   muttered to herself. Suddenly, a voice shouted, &quot;SHE CAN LIVE WITH   ME IF SHE WANTS!&quot; To Zoey's surprise, it was Dawn who had suggested   it. Dawn walked up to Zoey's bed and said, &quot;I'm sure she'll like   it there. She doesn't really have anyone else to go to, after all...&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey couldn't keep herself from blushing   as Dawn gave her a quick smile. The doctor nodded over the idea and   exclaimed, &quot;Understood! I'll send someone up with a wheelchair   right away!&quot; Once the doctor left the room, Zoey noticed that Dawn   had this creepy big grin on her face.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh...what's up with you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, sorry! I'm just so happy   that we'll be roommates!&quot;</p>
<p>'Yeah...roommates...with that damn   bastard Ash...' Zoey thought coldly. She didn't truly hate Ash, but   Zoey didn't like the idea of having to compete for Dawn's love. It was   hard enough for her as it is. &quot;Why does it have to be so hard?&quot;   Zoey muttered. Dawn gave her friend a curious look and asked, &quot;What   did you say?&quot; Zoey quickly waved it off and exclaimed, &quot;IT   WAS NOTHING! NOTHING AT ALL!&quot; <br />
</p>
<p>After finally checking out, Dawn led   Zoey to her car. As the two girls walked into the parkway, the doctor   from before looked out at them from a window. A nurse walked up to him   and asked, &quot;Doctor...why didn't you mention that girl's cuts on   her arms? They were clearly visible...&quot; </p>
<p>The doctor sighed and replied, &quot;I   noticed them. It's just that the girl is going through some emotional   problems, and I only know how to heal the body, not the soul...&quot;</p>
<p>The nurse nodded a bit and said, &quot;Do   you...think she'll be okay?&quot;</p>
<p>The doctor turned away from the window   and began walking down the hall to his next patient. &quot;I believe...that   Miss Dawn may be her salvation...&quot; <br />
</p>
<p>Once Dawn was on the main highway,   Zoey said, &quot;U-Uh...thanks alot for saving me, Dawn. I...I might   have died if it wasn't for you...&quot; Dawn smiled and replied, &quot;It's   no problem! I just couldn't believe that we'd end up meeting each other   again in such a terrible situation. At least you're okay...&quot; </p>
<p>Zoey smiled and looked out the window   to hide her embarrassment. Dawn giggled and exclaimed, &quot;You know,   Zoey, you're kind of cute when you smile! You should do it more often!&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey's face became even more flushed   from this.</p>
<p>'DAMN IT! WHY DID SHE HAVE TO SAY THAT?' </p>
