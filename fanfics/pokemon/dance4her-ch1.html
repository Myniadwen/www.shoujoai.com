<h1>A Dance for Her (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Red lights shone across the entire room. The atmosphere was hot and 
noisy. The noise was caused by loud club music. People were dancing for 
the time of their lives with no tomorrow. There was temptation for sweat 
to lurk on their clothes and escape from the pores of their skin. The 
occasional flashing lights made the desire to dance even greater.

A beautiful girl named Hikari sat around the table along with her 
friends Satoshi, Kasumi, Shigeru, Haruka and Takeshi. Actually, Haruka, 
Kasumi and Shigeru were more of Satoshi&#39;s friends of her own. Hikari was 
fortunate enough to meet the three some way along her journey. She 
considered them nice people. Hikari&#39;s eyelids were aching heavily, due 
to the fact that she never usually stayed up this late before.

&quot;Thanks a lot for this Satoshi,&quot; The brunette Haruka told the raven 
haired Boy, Satoshi. &quot;Shame Masato didn&#39;t want to come!&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Satoshi said removing his baseball cap. &quot;This place looks 
awesome!&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;s Masato?&quot; Hikari asked forgetting who Masato was, she swore that 
she heard of the name before.

&quot;My younger brother,&quot; Haruka replied facing Hikari. &quot;He thought Satoshi 
was crazy wanting us all to go out in a night club. I love your dress by 
the way,&quot; Haruka eyed on Hikari&#39;s black silk dress half covered in 
dazzling pink shiny sequin patterns.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Hikari replied. &quot;I&#39;m thinking of wearing this in the contest 
next week.&quot;

&quot;Awesome,&quot; Haruka replied. &quot;I might wear this dress for the contest next 
week too.&quot; Haruka was wearing a ruby coloured dress, which was quite 
revealing. &quot;Hopefully it&#39;s not too slutty.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure it will be ok.&quot; Hikari replied. Haruka smiled and Hikari 
smiled back. Hikari took her eyes away from the rest of the group and 
noticed someone that she knew really well. She had her eyes on the fire 
red head Nozomi, who was near the bar with a drink, which was wrapped 
around her hand. Something about Nozomi, made Hikari want more. She 
heard Satoshi talk to the rest of the group. However she could not 
comprehend what they were all talking about. Daydreaming of Nozomi 
jeopardised her concentration. Her eyes became fixed into Nozomi; she 
was so alone. Hikari&#39;s instinct sparked her to get Nozomi to join them.

Hikari noticed Nozomi wearing sparkling emerald stud earrings. Hikari 
adored how her white suit made Nozomi masculine and tomboyish. Nozomi&#39;s 
angelic coloured suit created a wild contrast with her ginger hair. 
Hikari began smiling to herself excitably watching her private female 
crush. Although Nozomi didn&#39;t seem excited, Hikari enjoyed the thought 
of making her excited.

&quot;Hikari,&quot; Satoshi nudged her. Hikari had suddenly ceased her 
daydreaming. &quot;What do you think this place?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s pretty nice,&quot; Hikari replied. &quot;The music&#39;s a little loud but it 
will do.&quot; Hikari&#39;s eyes became fixed onto Nozomi again. This time, she 
captured Nozomi&#39;s eye contact. Nozomi decided to wave and Hikari decided 
waved back in return adding a smile to her face. &quot;Hi Nozomi!&quot; Hikari 
exclaimed cheerfully. Both Takeshi and Satoshi quickly gave Nozomi a 
quick wave too. Nozomi didn&#39;t hesitate to come over to their table. She 
also appeared happier than what she looked earlier. Hikari began to feel 
her stomach churning the minute Nozomi sat next to her whilst she rubbed 
against her black silk dress with pink sequins.

&quot;I love the dress Hikari,&quot; Nozomi told Hikari smiling. The churning in 
Hikari&#39;s stomach increased, as it started to show on her blushing 
cheeks.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Hikari replied quickly smiling in return. &quot;I&#39;m going to wear 
it for next weeks contest!&quot;

&quot;I sure hope you&#39;ve trained your pokemon for the contest,&quot; Nozomi sighed 
in concern. &quot;Not just your own presentation!&quot;

&quot;I will,&quot; Hikari announced. &quot;Just tonight is a time to relax and party.&quot;

&quot;You know,&quot; Takeshi announced suddenly in an excited tone. &quot;There are so 
many hot girls around here! I&#39;m actually getting hard...&quot;

&quot;You do not have to share that Takeshi!&quot; Kasumi exclaimed quickly 
grabbing his ear and covering his mouth. Takeshi gritted his teeth in 
slight annoyance. Shigeru smirked and flicked his hand to spank Kasumi&#39;s 
ass playfully. Kasumi&#39;s attention sparked at Shigeru. &quot;Shigeru!&quot; Kasumi 
shrieked loudly. Shigeru smirked wrapping his arms against the skinny 
girl. Then pushed her to her lap. Haruka sighed along with Satoshi. 
Hikari simply watched the chemistry between Shigeru and Kasumi. If only 
her and Nozomi would be the same way.

&quot;Hey Kasumi!&quot; Shigeru grinned whispering in the red head girl&#39;s ear. 
Hikari managed to lip-read what Shigeru was saying, &quot;Will you dance with 
me Kasumi?&quot; Kasumi nodded very quickly in return. After accepting 
Shigeru&#39;s request, Kasumi stood up and Hikari realised how short 
Kasumi&#39;s yellow dress really was; her buttocks were just about covered. 
Shigeru seemed to be pleased with what he got as he took Kasumi&#39;s hand 
to the floor.

Some minutes after the gang watched Shigeru and Kasumi dance, Hikari 
found herself to be resting on Nozomi&#39;s chest by accident. The noise and 
atmosphere destroyed her sense of control and sense of direction. Hikari 
felt extremely comfortable around Nozomi. She was almost dreaming. 
&quot;They&#39;re pretty good at dancing aren&#39;t they?&quot; Nozomi pointed out. Hikari 
looked up noticing that Nozomi didn&#39;t seem to mind one bit that Hikari 
was resting on her chest.

&quot;Yeah they do,&quot; Hikari agreed, nodding at the same time.

&quot;Hey Satoshi,&quot; Haruka shouted nudging Satoshi&#39;s left shoulder. Satoshi 
turned around facing her sapphire eyes watching Haruka slightly blush. 
&quot;I was wandering, will you dance with me?&quot;

&quot;Erm.... Sure,&quot; Satoshi stumbled. &quot;I&#39;m no good at dancing but sure why 
not!&quot; Satoshi watched Haruka jump up in glee as he grabbed onto Haruka&#39;s 
hand.

Hikari smiled watching them both take to the floor. Hikari began to hold 
on Nozomi&#39;s hand. Hikari began to feel the chemistry rise in heat and 
emotion. Hikari couldn&#39;t help but continue blushing. Hikari had no idea 
where to look, at her friends dancing or in Nozomi&#39;s eyes. &quot;I love 
dancing,&quot; Hikari blurted out without thinking of what to say. &quot;I used to 
do ballet when I was younger.&quot;

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Nozomi replied pulling her face closer to Hikari&#39;s 
sapphire silk hair. &quot;I bet you&#39;re a pretty good dancer is well,&quot; Nozomi 
realised that she had found herself in the same situation as Hikari. 
They were both touching eachother. The best thing was, neither of them 
minded at all. Nozomi began stroking Hikari&#39;s tasteful thigh and gave 
Hikari a very serious look. Nozomi&#39;s stare gave Hikari the opportunity 
to value Nozomi&#39;s luscious lips. Lightly pink to go with Nozomi&#39;s peachy 
skin. Hikari pushed her head closer to Nozomi and rested her lips on 
Nozomi&#39;s mouth.

Nozomi&#39;s mouth began to open and Hikari&#39;s eyes began to shut. Nozomi 
slowly licked around Hikari&#39;s lips tasting her strawberry flavoured 
lip-gloss in the progress. Her tongue eventually entered Hikari&#39;s mouth 
and rested on Hikari&#39;s tongue. Hikari&#39;s own tongue brushed against 
Nozomi&#39;s pearly white teeth receiving the warm feeling of her saliva 
mixing with Nozomi&#39;s saliva at the same time. Hikari felt Nozomi grope 
her breast lightly and she shivered as even more sudden thoughts of 
Nozomi making love to her pushed further. They both eventually pulled 
themselves away from each other although their magnetic lips still 
preformed soft, hard and gentle lip locks.

After the lip locks ceased. Nozomi crawled over to Hikari who was 
shivering in pleasure. &quot;Hikari,&quot; Nozomi whispered. &quot;Dance with me.&quot; 
Hikari became speechless. She knew Nozomi wasn&#39;t asking. Nozomi was 
demanding a dance. The demand was gentle and felt sweet. Hikari&#39;s 
heartbeat had increased and the heat from her blushing had increased her 
intensity. Hikari nodded softly with a little smile. She was at a loss 
for words.

Nozomi stood up rather quickly; carrying the loved up Hikari in front of 
her rubbing Hikari&#39;s back against her chest and whit her hands, touching 
Hikari&#39;s body and the dress that covered her body. Nozomi swung Hikari 
over to her face, she wrapped her arms around Hikari&#39;s slender waist and 
stepped forward dragging Hikari with her. Hikari wrapped her arms around 
Nozomi&#39;s broad shoulders and rested her head on Nozomi&#39;s shoulder. 
Nozomi managed to smell Hikari&#39;s sweet fumes from her body and her hair. 
Nozomi&#39;s hands rubbed against Hikari&#39;s active hips. Hikari&#39;s swivelling 
hips caused Nozomi swivel along with her holding close to her hips.

Hikari grabbed onto Nozomi&#39;s hand and rotated three hundred and sixty 
degrees twice and jumped onto Nozomi again. Hikari started to wrap her 
leg around Nozomi&#39;s waist and wrapped her arm around Nozomi&#39;s neck. Then 
Hikari fell backwards whilst still having eye contact with Nozomi and 
with her free arm she pulled her dress up higher to her stomach. Hikari 
deliberately flashed her bright pink panties on Nozomi and the slid on 
to the floor.

Nozomi catched Hikari around the waist and brought her up and Hikari 
gladly wrapped her left leg around Nozomi again. Hikari pulled herself 
closer to Nozomi until they had enough contact to passionately kiss 
again. &quot;Did you like what you see?&quot; Hikari asked seductively.

&quot;I sure did,&quot; Nozomi replied. &quot;But remember, I&#39;m the dominant one.&quot;

&quot;OK,&quot; Hikari smiled and gave Nozomi a quick kiss on the lips. Nozomi 
pouted and Hikari kissed her again. The lip locks started to form again 
and it wasn&#39;t long until they were exchanging liquid again. The loud 
music gave them both a headache and the heat caused them both to be hot 
and sweaty. The huge crowds gave a lack of space to move. So passionate 
kisses were the easy option.

When the kiss broke Hikari and Nozomi stepped away from eachother to 
breath for a while. The eye contact was still strong. Hikari felt tired, 
thirsty, and hungry for Nozomi&#39;s charm. Hikari&#39;s legs dropped to the 
floor. Hikari&#39;s breathing became harder as her chest implored to the 
floor. Her head rested on the cold shiny floor with lights shining 
directly in her eye. Hikari closed her eyes and whispered Nozomi&#39;s name 
endlessly.

Nozomi dashed over to Hikari and touched her forehead. Her forehead was 
baking hot and knew that Hikari was trying to say something. Nozomi 
decided that this was no place for Hikari to be. She gently rolled 
Hikari over to her lap, carried her in her arms and then lifted her up. 
Hikari&#39;s legs were dangling on Nozomi&#39;s arms and her head was resting on 
Nozomi&#39;s shoulder. Nozomi carried Hikari quickly to the exit door of the 
club.

As Nozomi left, she felt relieved. The sky was black; it was much 
quieter and quite cold. Nozomi knew exactly were she was going. The 
hotel Nozomi was staying in wasn&#39;t so far from the club. Just another 
turn and she would spot a large grand building. After Hikari settled 
down in the hotel room, Nozomi was hoping to go lots of fun stuff with 
her. It was only ten o&#39;clock after all.
