<h1>Rainbow Reminiscence (part 12 of 18)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nikolai.html">Nikolai Mirovich</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/rainbow-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>The sky was still mostly clear as the sun hung low over the mountains 
far to the West, turning the sky a myriad of colours as Miranda stepped 
out of the crowded elevator. The rooftop restaurant, overlooking Celadon 
City wasn&#39;t crowded due to the rain earlier in the week, and Erika&#39;s 
group had no problem taking the largest of the round white tables near 
the edge of the roof. 

The restaurant known as &quot;Sorera No Koitsu Harubaru No Akuro&quot; was done in 
the usual Celadon style, with fancy wooden trellises affixed to the low 
plas-crete walls, forming a tall fence which was covered tangling leafy 
vines whose large petaled soft blue flowers filled the air with their 
subtly sweet scent. The legs of the round white tables and round seated 
metal chairs were made of twisting, twining metal rods made to resemble 
climbing vines, and each table had its own colourful centerpiece, made 
up of various small flowers and a few pleasantly shaped leaves of 
varying shades of green.

The plas-crete floor was made from interlocking dark green bricks, 
forming circles in several places where tall, broadleaf deciduous trees 
sprouted up from the layer of soil concealed beneath the floor. Despite 
the height of the Celadon Department Store, the open-air rooftop 
restaurant wasn&#39;t uncomfortably cool, with a calm, pleasant breeze 
suffusing the area to distribute the scent of the flowing vines, as soft 
music played softly in the background, ensuring that all the customer&#39;s 
senses were to be appeased.

The actual kitchen of the &quot;Sorera No Koitsu Harubaru No Akuro&quot; was only 
partially concealed within the low building where the elevators were 
located. Through a long, narrow window in the side of the building 
several people in kitchen-whites where visible hurriedly preparing meals 
amidst clouds of steam and the near constant sizzling of grills.

&quot;You know, it feels strange to be in one city for so long,&quot; Miranda 
mused as the waiter left their table after taking everyone&#39;s orders, 
receiving a concerned look from Erika, &quot;Usually I&#39;d be on my way 
somewhere else by now.&quot;

&quot;Well, you&#39;re not escaping our clutches just yet,&quot; Samantha chuckled 
with a sly grin, her chin resting upon her linked fingers.

&quot;So long as I don&#39;t outstay my welcome,&quot; the courier replied, glancing 
at Erika and her quiet, sagely smile. 

&quot;Everyone needs a vacation now and then,&quot; the woman replied as the 
waiter returned with their drinks, &quot;You more than most, it would seem.&quot;

Miranda sighed heavily and nodded, blushing lightly. &quot;I have been going 
non-stop for a while now,&quot; she admitted with a small shrug.

&quot;It&#39;s easier that way, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Erika inquired quietly, leaning 
forward as she lowered her voice.

Miranda looked up, catching the woman&#39;s gaze and flinching slightly as 
Erika all but looked into her soul. &quot;You can&#39;t keep running forever, you 
know,&quot; the Gym Leader said softly, reaching over and taking Miranda&#39;s 
hand, &quot;Your life doesn&#39;t change by ignoring it.&quot;

The courier closed her eyes for a moment, cringing a bit at the woman&#39;s 
words. &quot;Sometimes there&#39;s an awful lot to run away from,&quot; she muttered 
quietly.

Erika&#39;s hand squeezed a little tighter as Miranda tensed. &quot;You can 
always talk to me if you need to,&quot; the woman said softly, a small smile 
crossing her lips, &quot;It&#39;s one of the reasons I chose to follow in my 
grandMother&#39;s footsteps.&quot;

Miranda closed her eyes a moment, taking a slow breath and nodding 
slowly as he glanced back up at her hostess. &quot;I guess I&#39;m following in 
my Mother&#39;s then,&quot; she said with a chuckle, glancing out over the 
rainbow colours of the city&#39;s plethora of gardens and flowering trees, 
&quot;She left home and never looked back too, you know.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure she had her reasons,&quot; Erika replied seriously.

The courier nodded. &quot;She did,&quot; Miranda said heavily, turning back to the 
Gym Leader, &quot;And I have mine.&quot;

Erika sighed heavily, her hand slipping away as she gave Miranda a 
happier smile, suddenly dispelling the dark edge from her tone. &quot;We can 
discuss this another time, deary,&quot; she promised as the waiter returned, 
&quot;Perhaps tomorrow I can show you around my city? It&#39;s really a lovely 
place, and I doubt a courier really has much time for sightseeing.&quot;

&quot;Seldom,&quot; the girl agreed, smiling inspite of herself, &quot;And yes, I&#39;d 
like that. Thanks...&quot;</pre>
