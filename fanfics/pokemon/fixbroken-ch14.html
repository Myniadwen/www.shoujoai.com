<p>(It’s a flashback):</p>
<p>3 years ago, a horrible incident occurred.   A young woman, driven insane by jealousy and broken emotions, shot several   people, including her younger brother, before killing herself. Due to   this tragedy, the Pokemon Contest system was put on hold for months.</p>
<p>This is the tragedy of 'the last contest'... <br />
</p>
<p>Zoey stared at herself in the mirror   and smiled. She was wearing her usual coordinator outfit, which oddly   made her look like a prince of sorts, along with a small golden clip   in her hair. 'Hmm...' she thought to herself, 'Maybe I should have put   on a bit more of the flashier stuff...this is the Sinnoh Contest finals,   after all!' </p>
<p>Suddenly, the door to her dressing   room swung open, and Zoey's parents walked in with big smiles on their   faces. They were both extremely proud of their daughter for getting   this far in the contests.&quot;Oh, honey! We're so happy for you! There's   no way you can lose now!&quot; Mrs. Richards exclaimed happily while   giving her daughter a hug and a quick kiss on the cheek.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know about that...&quot;   Zoey remarked, &quot;Anyone is able to end up winning this thing. I'm   sure Dawn has a really good chance and-&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey's father tried to look as serious   and reserved as always, but he couldn't help but feel happy for his   only daughter. Breaking out into laughter, he exclaimed, &quot;Dawn?   That blue-haired little brat? Please! None of those losers has a chance   against you!&quot;</p>
<p>It hurt Zoey to hear her father say   such things, especially about Dawn, but she just thanked her parents   for their support and rushed them out of the room. &quot;I still need   to get ready, though. I'll look out for you guys in the audience, okay?&quot;   Once the door separating her and her parents had been locked, Zoey broke   down and cried.</p>
<p>Covering her tear-stained face, Zoey   thought, 'I've been in love with Dawn for so long...and my parents don't   even have a clue. I tried coming out to them several times, but I always   wimped out because I was afraid. I was afraid of what my parents would   think. As my parents, I should always be able to trust them and believe   in them...but I can't. I don't know what they'd think if they knew that   I was a lesbian...'</p>
<p>Someone suddenly knocked on the door,   so Zoey wiped her eyes and opened it. It was Dawn, and she was wearing   such a cute beautiful dress that it took all Zoey had to keep herself   from collapsing on top of her. Dawn walked into the room and gave Zoey   a hug.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a good-luck hug from   me to you!&quot; Dawn exclaimed happily, not noticing how red Zoey's   face had become. Once they separated, Zoey put on a smile and asked,   &quot;So...are you nervous at all? I know I am!&quot; Dawn thought for   a moment, her innocent face still glowing with excitement.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I'm nervous, too...everything's   going to be shown live on TV, and only one person can come out on top.   But...but if I lose, then I lose. It just means that I'm not strong   enough yet. At the least, if I can't do it, I would want you to win...&quot;   Dawn replied.</p>
<p>'God...she's so sweet and innocent...like   an angel...' Zoey thought, the heat rising in her cheeks once again.   Looking up at the clock, Dawn realized there was only an hour left until   the contest finally started! The blue-haired beauty quickly bid Zoey   good-bye and dashed out the door. Zoey stared at the other girl's ass   for a few minutes before deciding to check out the arena itself.</p>
<p>Walking out through the hall and to   one of the entrances, Zoey peeked out. People were still pouring into   the building as the final arrangements were made for the contest battle   ground. A large pearl-white square platform was in the middle of the   large domed room. That was where the coordinator battles were supposed   to take place.</p>
<p>'Hmm...this is going to get really   exciting soon!' Zoey thought with a grin. As she turned around to head   back to her room, she bumped into someone. It was a tall brown-haired   girl with a bandanna on her head and rather large breasts. For some   reason, she had completely ignored Zoey and didn't even bother apologizing   as she continued storming down the hallway.</p>
<p>Zoey frowned and thought, 'Yeesh...what   a rude bitch! ...Still, she had nice boobs.' And with that, Zoey just   shrugged and went back into her room, not knowing that that girl she   had run into would soon be the cause of a terrible incident...</p>
<p>An hour later, all of the participants   were called down to the stadium grounds, where the announcer, a young   buxom woman. came in and kicked off the beginning of the final Sinnoh   Contest.</p>
<p>&quot;WELCOME, EVERYONE, TO THE SINNOH   CONTEST FINALS, WHERE THE VICTOR WILL BE CROWNED AS TOP CONTEST CHAMPION!!&quot;   The announcer exclaimed into her microphone, which caused the entire   crowd to erupt into applause. Zoey gulped nervously as the contestants   were soon called out into the arena.</p>
<p>Standing next to her was Dawn, who   leaned over and whispered, &quot;Don't look so nervous, Zoey. Just try   and relax...don't think of it as something so big and important...take   a deep breath and calm down...&quot; Zoey wasn't really sure how it   was possible to be relaxed with such an important competition about   to unfold.</p>
<p>&quot;First,&quot; the announcer shouted,   &quot;We will present to you the match-ups for coordinator battles!&quot;   As a large TV screen overhead flickered to life to show the board, Zoey   could have sworn she saw Dawn's smile falter for only a second.</p>
<p>'Was...was it just my imagination?'   Zoey wondered. That was when she realized that she and Dawn had been   paired up to fight against one another in the second round. Clenching   her fists, Zoey prepared herself for anything as the first round quickly   started, two trainers walking up onstage and letting out their pokemon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two people were engaged   in an intense argument in a nearby hallway. An argument that will cause   something terrible to happen. It was Ash Ketchum, who was constantly   being followed by a weeping May.</p>
<p>&quot;Why...why don't you love me?   I came all the way here just to see you again!&quot; May screeched,   tears pouring down her face. The poor girl looked completely miserable,   but Ash didn't seem to care about that.</p>
<p>He just turned around, glared hatefully   at May, and snapped, &quot;I don't love you because I love someone else!   I already have a girlfriend, May! Don't you get it? Besides, what about   you and Drew?&quot;</p>
<p>May wasn't about to give up, though.   &quot;Drew? I...I only became his girlfriend so he'll take me here!   You're the one I truly love, Ash! You have to understand, Ash! Please...love   me back!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? Love you back? How can   I? I like you as a friend, May, a good friend...but nothing more, nothing   less. That's all...&quot;</p>
<p>Something within May's mind snapped   at that point.</p>
<p>Spinning back on his heel, Ash continued   to look for Misty. Still, May was unwilling to give up. 'Not now...I   can't lose...I need him to love me...' the brown-haired girl thought   desperately as she grabbed Ash's arm and pulled him around.</p>
<p>&quot;May, what're you-&quot;</p>
<p>Ash lost his train of thought when   May placed her lips over his own. As Ash felt May's tongue slip into   his mouth, he happened to look to the side and notice someone standing   there...Misty. A look of pure horror and despair was evident on her   face.</p>
<p>His own eyes widening, Ash pushed May   to the ground and cried, &quot;Misty...this isn't...I...this isn't what   it looks like! Please...please...please listen to me!!&quot;</p>
<p>Instead of replying, Misty just turned   around and ran down the hall and out the front doors. Ash cursed under   his breath and, a powerful rage swelling up inside him, he looked over   at May and slapped her hard across the face. He didn't even care about   what he was doing anymore; this slut might have ruined the only real   relationship Ash ever had.</p>
<p>Ash's entire body shook as he screamed,   &quot;YOU BITCH! YOU STUPID, FUCKIN' BITCH! DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU'VE DONE?   MISTY...MISTY...YOU MADE ME HURT MISTY'S FEELINGS BY DOING THAT! ...NO,   WHAT AM I SAYING? A WHORISH SLUT LIKE YOURSELF COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND   SOMETHING LIKE 'REAL LOVE'! JUST...GET OUT OF MY SIGHT!&quot;</p>
<p>With one final glare brimming with   hatred, Ash ran after Misty, hoping it wasn't too late. May, however,   just sat on the floor with a blank stare. After a moment, she began   to smile. Then...she began to laugh. She laughed and laughed in a high-pitched   whimsical tone. A small trail of saliva slid down her chin as she continued   to laugh.</p>
<p>That was when she remembered the special   'item' she had brought along...just in case things didn't work out between   her and Ash. At that moment, Drew walked into the hall and happened   to notice May on the floor. Walking up to her, he asked, &quot;Hey,   May...what's wrong? Did you fall or something? I'm going to be fighting   in the third round, so we can-&quot;</p>
<p>Drew's words were garbled as two bullets   teared into his neck and sliced away the nerves. With a struggled cough,   Drew collapsed to the floor, dead. May smiled to herself and stared   at the smoking pistol in her shaking hands. Reaching into her pocket,   she pulled out several more bullets, which she stocked into the pistol.</p>
<p>'Yes...yes...yesssssss...Ash will pay   for not loving me...he will payyyy...'</p>
<p>May pushed herself up off the ground   and walked off to find more victims, ignoring the bloody puddle now   forming under Drew's corpse.</p>
<p>Back at the arena, the gunshots from   earlier were drowned out by the cheers of the crowd. The first round   had just finished, and it was now time for Zoey and Dawn to battle.   Both girls were full of inner confidence as they walked up onto the   platform and faced each other, pokeballs at the ready.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you ready...Zoey?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm ready for anything...Dawn.&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey lifted her pokeball up into the   air, and was about to throw it, when-</p>
<p><em>BLAM!</em></p>
<p>The announcer slumped to the floor,   a small round bullet hole in her left temple. Zoey looked around and   her eyes fell upon May, who was laughing quite insanely while waving   the pistol around. The people in the audience broke out into screams   and hysterics as they all tried to push their way out of the building.</p>
<p>'That...that's the girl I ran into   earlier!' Zoey noticed, but then she realized something far more important...</p>
<p>'Dawn!'</p>
<p>Running forward, Zoey grabbed onto   Dawn and pushed her down to the ground. It was the only thing she could   think of to protect themselves, since the nearest exit was being blocked   by this insane girl. Zoey looked at Dawn, and saw she was paralyzed   in fear. Tears were forming on the sides of her eyes, but she didn't   cry.</p>
<p>Zoey held Dawn a bit tighter and whispered   to herself, 'Please...please don't shoot us...please...' Several more   shots rang out, and Zoey resisted the urge to scream out. She glanced   up and scanned the area: several bodies were lying on the floor unmoving,   including a young kid with black hair and glasses.</p>
<p>There were at least six people dead;   who knows how many had been killed before this? 'Oh god...' Zoey thought   while swallowing the vomit in her throat, 'This...this is horrible...'   Suddenly, Dawn seemed to have snapped out of her shock. Sitting up,   she looked around and cried, &quot;What...what's going on?&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey saw May turn towards them, and   she let out a small scream. She tried to pull Dawn down, but it was   too late...that crazy brown-haired girl was aiming her pistol right   at them. Dawn saw this and, her body shivering, muttered, &quot;Z-Zoey...what...what   is going on? I...I don't understand...&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey cursed under her breath. 'There's   no way out of this,' she thought, 'This girl is ruthless...we'll be   killed for sure! If that's the case...then I need to make my last moments   count!' Zoey grabbed Dawn's shoulders, pulled the girl up next to her,   and kissed her softly on the lips. At that moment, the trigger was pulled   and the sound of something crashing to the ground was heard.</p>
<p>However...it was May who fell. Her   face was a bloody mess, and her pistol was lying off to the side, completely   ignored. It turned out she only had one bullet left, and May decided   to end her own life. Her heart and mind had been torn apart by her obsessive   love...and she paid dearly for letting it control her.</p>
<p>Ash entered the room, depressed and   alone, and freaked out when he realized he had almost stepped on the   head of Max, May's little brother. 'He's...dead...' Ash thought gravely,   quickly checking the younger boy's pulse. That was when he noticed Zoey   and Dawn seemingly kissing on the arena platform.</p>
<p>Seeing they were finally safe, Zoey   and Dawn separated. Dawn, who was still unable to comprehend what just   happened, lost consciousness. Zoey, however, was very much awake...and   she kept wishing this was all just a horrible, horrible dream...</p>
<p>It was a dream...a dream they couldn't   wake up from... <br />
</p>
<p>3 years later, after Zoey was soon   disowned by her parents when she decided to come out to them, it was   never revealed that Dawn remembers perfectly everything that happened   during that fateful last contest...the people dying...the insane gunner...and   that wonderful, if short, kiss she had shared with Zoey.</p>
<p>It took her a long time, but Dawn had   finally realized how she felt about the tomboyish redhead...</p>
<p>...she was falling in love with Zoey.   Now, all she had to do was gather the courage to tell her... </p>
