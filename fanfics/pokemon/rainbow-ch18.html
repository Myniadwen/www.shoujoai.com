Despite the warmth of the atrium, and the fact that the storm had long 
since subsided, the skylight high above the battlefield was still half 
covered in a thick blanket of snow as the crowd assembled along the 
sideline of the field.

At the West end of the field stood Erika, patiently waiting with her 
hands hidden within the pale green sleeves of her silken kimono. As 
Misty and Miranda walked across the well-manicured lawn, the Gym Leader 
smiled, giving them a slow nod.

&quot;Any last minute advice, dearest?&quot; chuckled Misty, glancing up at 
Miranda as they walked hand-in-hand towards the East end of the field.

&quot;Just don&#39;t underestimate her,&quot; Miranda replied slyly, lifting their 
joined hands to her lips and kissing beloved&#39;s knuckles lightly, &quot;She 
only seems quiet and unassuming. I think Erika just likes letting people 
think she&#39;s a push over.&quot;

Misty nodded, grinning over at the woman and giving Erika a short wave. 
&quot;Well, just so long as you don&#39;t expect me to sleep with her if I 
loose,&quot; she said teasingly, causing Miranda&#39;s eyes to widen, her words 
catching in her throat.

&quot;Hey!&quot; the courier replied in mock annoyance, giving her lover&#39;s hip a 
playful shove with her own, &quot;I&#39;m not in the habit of bringing my former 
lovers fresh victims, ya know!&quot;

Misty just laughed at the comment, unweaving her fingers before all but 
grabbing Miranda by the back of the head and pulling the woman&#39;s face 
down the few inches that separated their heights. &quot;Good!&quot; Misty giggled 
teasingly before pressing her lips tightly against Miranda&#39;s leaving the 
courier gasping for breath as Misty stepped away, out onto the field and 
faced Erika...
