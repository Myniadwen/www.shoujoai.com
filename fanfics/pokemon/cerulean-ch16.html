<a href="../pokemon/cerulean-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>An hour slipped by without either of them noticing, and only the 
sound of Irene locking the door as the last couple exited the shop 
snapped them both back into reality.

&quot;Oh, sorry!&quot; exclaimed Miranda, struggling awkwardly to her feet, 
&quot;I wasn&#39;t keeping track of the time.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s okay,&quot; Irene assured them with a motherly smile, &quot;Can I 
offer you a ride home?&quot;

&quot;You- you really don&#39;t have to,&quot; stammered Miranda, amazed by the 
offer even as Irene put on her Fall jacket and looked at them both 
expectantly, obviously unwilling to take &#39;no&#39; for an answer.

&quot;Well I guess we can&#39;t really say no,&quot; replied Misty, getting to 
her feet without a problem.

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; assured Irene with an amused look as she threw on 
the scarf she had long since finished knitting and quickly moved 
about the room blowing out the candles.

&quot;Oh yeah, how much do we owe you?&quot; inquired Miranda.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; said Irene with a dismissive wave of her 
hand as she came back, unlocked the door and shut out the few dim 
lights, &quot;You had to endure that pompous jerk, Troy&#39;s posturing for 
an evening, not to mention his so called food. So it&#39;s on me. So, 
where are you guys staying?&quot;

&quot;The Gym actually,&quot; explained Misty as they ventured into the 
parking lot which was empty except for one of the small, box-like 
electrically driven cars most people were forced to drive.

&quot;Really?&quot; commented Irene in amazement, pointing her key chain at 
the vehicle and disengaging the alarm, &quot;Are you related to the 
owners?&quot;

Misty smiled, trying not to laugh. &quot;I&#39;m their sister.&quot;

Irene did a double take and laughed. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she apologized, 
opening her door, &quot;But you&#39;re... Oh, sorry. Never mind.&quot;

&quot;No, no,&quot; assured Misty with amusement as she and Miranda got into 
the back seat, &quot;Please, speak your mind.&quot;

Irene nodded as she adjusted the mirror. &quot;I was just going to say, 
you&#39;re far too polite. Not to mention, nice. I had your sisters in 
my store once, but they took one look at the place and left. 
There&#39;s no pleasing some people, I guess.&quot;

&quot;Especially not them!&quot; agreed Misty with a laugh, moving closer to 
Miranda and taking her hand as the car sped almost silently out of 
the parking lot. 

On impulse, Misty put her head on her lover&#39;s shoulder, thinking 
about the hard, narrow bed they&#39;d have to share once they got 
home. &#39;Oh well,&#39; she thought ruefully, &#39;it may be little more than 
an overgrown cot, but at least I&#39;m the one sharing it with 
Miranda...&#39; </pre>
