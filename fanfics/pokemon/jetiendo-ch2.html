<h1>Jetiendo (part 2 of 38)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/jetiendo-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The train halted. They&#39;re at Jetiendo at last. Outside the windows was a 
group of nuns and priests and a girl beside them. Gary, ignoring all the 
noise in the background was glaring at the girl as if it she was angel 
from above. When the girl turned and looked at Gary he smiled at her. 
She smiled back. 

&quot; Gary pay attention please&quot; Mr Grinal barked. As if he didn&#39;t like what 
he was seeing. 

&quot; Sorry&quot; replied Gary. 

&quot; Let me do it&quot; Mr Cowell whispered to Mr Grinal. Mr Grinal had to 
accept defeat and sit down. Meanwhile Gary found an opportunity to smile 
at Tasha again. 

&quot; Ok&quot; Mr Cowell &quot; let&#39;s have some silence.&quot; Instant silence throughout 
the train &quot; thank you, now as you see the clergy are here you will be 
greeted by them and princess Tasha the girl there. Ask questions when we 
get out there are people wanting to get in. 

Sensibly they all walked out sensibly as if they where angels. To Mr 
Grinal&#39;s astonishment, they did it well. Gary and Tasha where still 
smiling at each over. 

As soon as every one went out the train Father Luigi went up to greet Mr 
Grinal. 

&quot; Mr Grimsdale how delightful to see you&quot; Father Luigi smiled. The 
students giggled and Mr Grinal&#39;s face turned very red. Even Cowell had a 
smile. &quot; Sorry&quot; Father Luigi said &quot; Mr Grinal how delighted to see you&quot; 

&quot; Yes very&quot; Grinal said boringly. 

&quot; Well&quot; Mr Cowell interrupted so the class didn&#39;t go into chaos. &quot; You 
will all be living in the monastary it&#39;s free and if you are very good 
you may be allowed to go out on weekends. Now I think we should follow 
Father Luigi and the rest of clergy into the monastery&quot; 

&quot; Well&quot; Father Luigi announced &quot;it&#39;s only round the corner all we have 
to do is cross on the crossing beware of the street fights, bombs and 
guns and then we will be there.&quot; 

&quot; Oh&quot; Grinal interrupted &quot;I need to see Davis, T.K, Kari, Tai, Matt who 
else did I need to see Yolei stay I need to talk to you about the 
behaviour at the train the rest of you follow Father Luigi.&quot; 

Gary and Tasha were still staring at each over. It was amazing they even 
listened to what every one was saying then Tasha came to Gary to open a 
conversation. 

&quot; Hi&quot; Tasha smiled. 

&quot; Hi&quot; Gary replied. 

&quot; Keep up Tasha&quot; Father Luigi boomed. 

&quot; Yes Father,&quot; Tasha replied as she walked besides Gary. &quot; So where are 
you lot from?&quot; 

&quot; Well&quot; Gary mouthed &quot; Japan, Well some are it&#39;s an international school 
trip&quot; 

&quot; Where do you live then?&quot; Tasha asked kindly 

&quot; Pallet town&quot; 

&quot; Pallet town. Sister Arui went there once. She said it was a nice town. 
I lived in Jetiendo all my life my mother died but I still keep contact 
of my aunts Angelica and Zelda I mainly spend my free time here or with 
my friends. 

What do you do?&quot; 

&quot; I use to be a pokemon trainer&quot; Gary replied 

&quot; That&#39;s a huge responsibility isn&#39;t it?&quot; Tasha replied 

&quot; Yeah it is&quot; Gary replied &quot; but now I&#39;m doing research on reviving 
fossils. You could basically say that I&#39;m following my grandpa&#39;s 
footsteps&quot; 

&quot; Could your grandpa in any way be Prof. Oak?&quot; 

&quot; Yeah&quot; Gary answered, &quot;He is&quot; 

&quot; Oh&quot; Replied Tasha. &quot; He visited 20 years ago before Father Luigi 
became a priest he and his brother where known world wide as the super 
Mario bros. &quot; 

&quot; Love is in the air 

Love is in the air&quot; 

Sung a two voices Gary and Tasha where turning around looking for the 
singers 

&quot; Down here&quot; squeaked two voices. Two tiny Eskimos one a girl wearing 
pink and one a boy wearing blue they both had a mallet in their left 
hand 

&quot; Nana, Polo&quot; Tasha replied 

&quot; How are you?&quot; Nana replied 

&quot; Fine&quot; Tasha replied &quot; and you&quot; 

&quot; Quality&quot; Nana replied.&quot; Well I&#39;m going to bed I&#39;m really tired 

&quot;Goodnight&quot; Tasha replied as soon as Nana who was yawning away was 
entering the monastary Polo turned around and sung quietly to Gary and 
Tasha 

&quot;Love is in the air&quot; 

&quot; Polo&quot; Tasha muttered &quot;very funny like his sister&quot; 

&quot;Yeah&quot; Gary replied. 

Momements later about midnight Gary and Tasha where still talking to 
each over at the entrance of the monastary &quot; let&#39;s go in the monastary&quot; 
Tasha said 

&quot; I think that&#39;s a great idea&quot; Gary replied. 

As they walked in the monastery with all the decorations of ornaments, 
vases, doll, bibles, gold and portraits galore. It was almost like a 
palace, the seats where decorated with silver laced cushions and painted 
gold. The emerald plated altar, and the amethysts encrusted on the 
chalices. Pearls hanging on the chandelier 

&quot; Are you sure we are in the right place Tasha?&quot; Gary asked 

&quot; Of course we are &quot; Tasha replied this is only the entrance &quot; perhaps I 
should give you a tour&quot; 

&quot; Yes please&quot; Gary gasped, &quot; thanks Tasha&quot; 

&quot; Ok &quot; Tasha announced &quot;the Bronze door on your right is the social 
corridor where we have dinner room, the garden, the activity&#39;s room and 
loads of other stuff. The bronze door to your left is the dormitory 
where every one from the trip would be now asleep that&#39;s where you get 
washed, getting dressed in there. Also there is a good shortcut to the 
garden. So where would you like to go &quot; 

&quot; The garden&quot; Gary replied &quot; and take the short cut&quot; in excitement. 

&quot; Very well&quot; Tasha smiled &quot; we have to be quiet so we don&#39;t wake them 
up&quot; 

&quot;Ok&quot; Gary replied 

Without noticing they where holding hands to the dormitory as they 
entered the left bronze door footsteps where very loud bang, bang, bang. 
As they where running 

Mr O Grady walked out of his room and spotted Gary and Tasha&#39;s shadows 
from a distance 

&quot; Get back here&quot; roared Mr O Grady &quot; I&#39;ll get you love birds&quot; 

Despite being caught by Mr O Grady they managed to reach the garden. 

The garden was spectacular. The waterfall, the fountain and the flowers 
galore, statues of angels and on the walls prayers frogs and fairies 
gathered around the garden 

&quot; Wow&quot; gasped Gary &quot; this must of cost a fortune&quot; 

&quot; It did&quot; Tasha smiled &quot; this monastery took about over a century to 
create this place, also expensive.&quot; 

Tasha took a pause &quot; However.&quot; 

&quot; However what?&quot; Gary asked puzzled &quot; it&#39;s a paradise&quot; 

&quot; Yes&quot; Tasha whispered &quot; not the true paradise not the eternal one. I 
believe in God&quot; 

&quot; Well&quot; Gary as he was stoned &quot; I&#39;m not that religious myself&quot; 

&quot; Doesn&#39;t matter&quot; Tasha smiled &quot; I&#39;ve been with worse people.&quot; 

&quot; You have&quot; stoned Gary 

&quot; Excuse Me,&quot; snapped the voice the Dr Spoona &quot; what are you doing here? 
Your suppose to be asleep&quot; 

&quot; It&#39;s ok sir he was with me&quot; Tasha replied. 

&quot; Yeah its both our faults got carried away,&quot; Gary added 

&quot; Well get to bed&quot; Spoona demanded &quot; or I have to tell Mr Grinal&quot; 

&quot; Wait&quot; Tasha said to Gary &quot; I didn&#39;t get your name&quot; 

&quot; It&#39;s Gary,&quot; Gary said &quot;goodnight Tasha&quot; 

&quot; Goodnight Gary&quot; whispered Tasha. 

As soon as Gary left this romantic scene with dr spoona&#39;s annoying eye 
on him he was lead to his room. 

The boys where asleep before him. How could he get sleep when half the 
people in the bedroom are snoring as loud as someone would talk in a 
football pitch? 

However he stared at the window looking at Tasha befriending the fairies 
and frogs. Then as Tasha fell asleep on the hammock the fairies pulled a 
white silky blanket over her. Gary watched her sleep between the 
fairies. The graceful thing the snoring was continually roared away. 

&quot; PIKA&quot; snapped Pikachu because of all the noise making not sleep. 

Ash is here thought Gary. 

&quot; What&#39;s wrong pikachu?&quot; Ash asked Pikachu. He was there all right. 

&quot; Ash&quot; Gary gasped, &quot; How did you get here?&quot; 

&quot; Davis wrote my name on the register&quot; Ash replied 

&quot; So Davis crept you in, &quot; Gary asked 

&quot; Yeah&quot; replied Ash. 

&quot; Ash&quot; Gary announced &quot; did you remember when we where best mates?&quot; 

&quot; I think so&quot; Ash answered &quot; but after an argument we pretended we 
didn&#39;t know each over&quot; 

&quot; Our rivalry was as high as any body in pallet town&quot; 

&quot; Yeah until I beated you &quot; 

Then the door bursted wide-open Mr Paykei bursted straight in 

&quot; Mr fucking Paykei bugger, bicthes, wankers shagging each over sod piss 
off fuck off OH SHIT why are you two bastards fucking awake for?&quot; barked 
Mr Paykei 

&quot; Have wogs like you ever heard of knocking?&quot; Ash snapped back. Gary 
just bursted out laughing. 

&quot; Please&quot; Gary said civilised &quot; I don&#39;t wanna wake Mr O Grady again so 
nigger it&#39;s best if you just walk away and go back to bed &quot; 

&quot; I&#39;m taking your bloody names down&quot; Mr Paykei snapped, &quot;what are your 
names&quot; 

&quot; I&#39;m Paul and he is Shirley &quot; Ash replied 

&quot; I&#39;ll fucking get you wankers. Sods. Bicthes. Bloody fucking shitty 
bastards. I&#39;ll fuck your family and treat you like piece of shit.&quot; 
Barked Mr Paykei &quot; I&#39;ll piss of now but not for long&quot; Mr Paykei stormed 
out and slammed the door.
