<h1>To Protect Someone I Love...</h1>

<pre>Kasumi...

&quot;Kuso! Why can&#39;t I get that twerp&#39;s name out of my head?!&quot; I wondered 
aloud to myself as I took a shower. Three years have past since Satoshi 
won the Hoenn League Championships and Team Rocket disbanded. Since the 
disbandment I have been working legally with Kojiro as clerks in &quot;4U&quot; a 
pretty much new place that is situated in the Cerulean City Plaza, about 
two blocks away from the gym. Kasumi has stopped by every once in a 
while for new clothes, but those were rare visits. She struck up a new 
friendship with me, but I told her that I was Mariko and Kojiro was 
Akira. Often when Kasumi stopped by, I found myself spacing off and 
thinking about her fondly. She congratulated me when I showed her my 
favorite team: Arbok, Seviper, Dustox, Wobuffet, Persian, and Rapidash.

&quot;Calm yourself down, Musashi! You&#39;re...&quot; I tried to be honest. 
&quot;...falling in love with the woman.&quot;

I came out of the shower and put on my glasses. My vision, after being 
shocked so many times, got steadily worse up until I was forced to wear 
glasses. When I finally wore glasses, my eyesight stopped worsening and 
improved. Kojiro says that they made me look sexy, but I think that she 
is only saying that to make me feel better. 

I brushed my hair down. After quitting Team Rocket three days before it 
disbanded, Kojiro said that I didn&#39;t need a tough hairdo. &quot;What you 
need, girl, is a cute hairdo. Simply let your hair naturally fall 
downwards and a bang will make your hair cuter, and it&#39;ll curl at the 
end.&quot;

Kojiro was right. I did look cuter with my hair down and with a bang. It 
ended just above my rump.

Then I remembered the day Kasumi looked extremely cute. It was the day 
her Seadra evolved into a Kingdra. She looked so happy. She had let her 
hair down ever since she became the temporary gym leader and her hair 
ended just below the swell of her back. Apparently, her favorite clothes 
were tank top mid-drift and shorts. She had an innocent look about her, 
even when she shared the dirtiest of secrets with me. She often invited 
me to the gym and we&#39;d eat lunch and battle sometimes. It was after that 
reminiscence of that day Kasumi&#39;s Seadra turned into a Kingdra that I 
knew.

&quot;I not falling in love with her...I am in love with her.&quot; I realized.

On my lunch break, Kasumi tapped me on my shoulder. I looked back and 
there she was, panting and blushing. She had a sakura leaf upon her 
head, probably from the cherry tree we were under. We enjoyed lunch at 
our hiding spot and soon after she said that she had something to ask 
me.

&quot;What is it, Kasumichan?&quot; I questioned.

&quot;Well, I fell in love with someone, but I don&#39;t know what to tell them. 
They&#39;ve gotten to know me good after years and I feel like I should come 
up to them and tell them, but I&#39;m afraid that they might reject me.&quot; 
Kasumi cutely pushed her two index fingers together. &quot;Plus, I&#39;m a 
lesbian, Mariko.&quot;

&quot;Well that limits it down to half the population of the world.&quot; I joked 
around with her. &quot;If I were you, I&#39;d right up and kiss her. But Kasumi, 
my name&#39;s not Mariko. My name is...&quot; I was interrupted with a peck to 
the lips.

I blushed brightly and returned the display of affection. Then I 
gathered my train of thought and continued.

&quot;Kasumi, my name&#39;s not Mariko. My name&#39;s Musashi.&quot; I gloomily revealed.

The wonderful redhead gasped and backed away from me before she started 
to cry. I tried to give her a shoulder to cry on, but she turned away 
from me.

&quot;Y-you tricked me, Musashi! You toyed with my emotions so that you could 
steal my Pokemon!&quot; She managed to get out.

&quot;No. I&#39;m not the thief that you used to know. To be honest, I quit Team 
Rocket because of you. I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about you, and how you 
were always honest to me. I love you, Kasumichan and I want to be your 
girlfriend, if you&#39;d let me.&quot; I explained.

She cried on me and hugged me tightly. &quot;Musashichan! Aishiteru! I love 
you love you love you so much!&quot; She poured her heart to me.

It was then that a Houndoom sinking its teeth into Kasumi, howling in 
pain and writhing in my hands, broke our embrace. The trainer of that 
Houndoom apologized profusely for the bite, but after spotting the 
expensive necklace that I got Kasumi for her birthday, he took Kasumi 
hostage and demanded that I give him our valuables. I wound&#39;t stand for 
it and sent out my Arbok.

&quot;Arbok! Earthquake!&quot; I commanded. Arbok dug into the ground and 
triggered a seismic point before returning to the surface. The ground 
shook and I quickly dashed to get Kasumi. The thief feel into the valley 
with his Houndoom and Kasumi was hanging on to the ledge with her bad 
arm. I grabbed her arm before she fell into the ditch and she allowed me 
to carry her to her gym in my arms. She locked the door and allowed 
herself to heal. After a couple of days, she invited me over to her gym 
for lunch. Upon the gym floor was a picnic mat filled with an array of 
phallic food items. I naively asked, &quot;Is this for making our lunch?&quot; 

She smirked. &quot;Sort of.&quot;

She undressed, showing me a very womanly body, contrary to what she 
looked like a couple of days earlier.

&quot;I&#39;ve been drinking Moo Moo Milk for the past few days. I think my body 
has almost caught up to your womanliness?&quot; She explained.

I was in shock. That was the same treatment I used years ago. And yet, 
she looked extremely luscious, as her alabaster skin was sensitive to 
the touch and hardened her rather large nipples. I undressed and thumbed 
Kasumi&#39;s nipples. Kasumi moaned and lay down. Kasumi got aerosol whipped 
cream and sprayed it up my rump cheeks. I instinctively tightened my 
muscles and she lapped at my dessert-topped hole. She then prepped a 
banana and slowly ran it across my labia. I quivered and squatted onto 
the phallic fruit. She then lays upon Kasumi&#39;s pelvis and their orchids 
grinded. They grinded an appealed to the senses with licks, kisses and 
sexual touches. Kasumi found my pearl and thumbed it. I moaned out,  
&quot;Kasumi...&quot; and came. Kasumi came a minute after her. They laid upon the 
floor, Kasumi on top of me.

&quot;I love you, Musashichan.&quot; Kasumi sighed.

&quot;I love you too, Kasumichan.&quot; I sighed back.

And we slept there in our sticky love.
