&quot; We were bored to death&quot; T.K replied with a new confidence. &quot; Why don&#39;t 
we go out&quot;? 

&quot; There&#39;s a good place in Forset City.&quot; Ash interrupted 

&quot; Well&quot; May started &quot; Forset City it is&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;ve got nothing to wear&quot; Kari replied. 

&quot; You two&quot; T.K said to May and Kari &quot; check Mr O Grady&#39;s room. He was 
once a drag queen called Lilly Savage&quot; 

&quot; OK&quot; Kari replied as she walked out with May. 

&quot; And you&quot; T.K hissed at Ash &quot; you&#39;re gonna get smartened up. We&#39;re 
gonna steal Tai and Matt&#39;s clothes&quot; 

&quot; OK&quot; Ash said hastily, then they bursted out of the girls dormitory 
without leaving any traces. 

They waited at the teachers&#39; dormitory waiting for the girls to finish. 
As soon as they got out the four dumped their old clothes in the boy&#39;s 
dormitory they ran quietly and as quickly as they could. </pre>
