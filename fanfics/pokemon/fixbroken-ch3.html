<p>Zoey's entire body felt numb. 'No way...she's...she's   living with Ash?' Zoey looked up at Dawn, hoping she was just joking   around, but the blue-haired girl said nothing. </p>
<p>Finally summoning up the courage to   speak, Zoey asked, &quot;You and Ash...you aren't...dating...are you?&quot;   Dawn blushed a bit as she replied, &quot;Well...no, we aren't. We've   tried it a few times, but we couldn't seem to become anything more than   friends...&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey couldn't help but sigh a breath   of relief. Suddenly, she noticed something else that came to her attention.   &quot;Why are you two living together, though? Isn't Ash from Kanto?&quot;   Zoey asked. Even though Dawn denied it, Zoey was still afraid that Ash   and Dawn were going out.</p>
<p>&quot;He said...that he was going to   go back to Kanto when he was ready...but he never told me anything else   besides that...&quot; Dawn replied, quite confused about the whole thing   herself.</p>
<p>Zoey sighed and stared up at the ceiling,   her mind full of thought. Taking this as a sign to leave, Dawn said   a quick goodbye and walked out the door. Immediately, Zoey began slamming   her fists against her pillow.</p>
<p>&quot;GODDAMMIT!&quot; She screamed,   &quot;AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS, I COULDN'T EVEN THINK UP OF A SINGLE GOOD   THING TO SAY TO HER! GOD!&quot; Zoey took a few deep breaths to calm   down, but she broke out crying instead.</p>
<p>'I love her so much...but...but she   only cares for me as a friend...and after what happened in that last   contest four years ago, I don't think she'll ever be comfortable around   me again!' Zoey thought. She wanted to scream and shout with all her   might, but she didn't. She knew she had to keep her feelings under control.</p>
<p>Zoey wasn't sure what to think anymore.   She wanted to be with Dawn, but she couldn't risk losing to herself.   If she gave into her feelings now, her family would never accept her   again. Zoey wiped away some tears and thought, 'God...why does life   have to be so cruel?'</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zoey realized something strange.</p>
<p>'Why hadn't no one mentioned about   the cuts on my arms?'</p>
<p>Before anything else, though, sleep   overtook Zoey and she drifted off, her dreams focusing on one single   person: Dawn.Â </p>
