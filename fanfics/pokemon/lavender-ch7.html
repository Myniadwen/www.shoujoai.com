<h1>Lavender Ghost Story (part 7 of 23)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nikolai.html">Nikolai Mirovich</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/lavender-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>At the South end of Lavender Town, the high cliffs were met by rickety wooden 
bridge that stretched off into the hazy distance over the ocean far below. 
Occasionally connecting with the mainland for extra support, and slowly slanting 
downward, Route 12 served as the most direct path from Lavender to Maiden&#39;s 
Peak.

To the left of the old bridge, however, were a set of wooden stairs that hugged 
the rough curves of the sea battered cliff face, winding their way down to a 
long wooden walkway at about the midway point, as well as the rocky beach below.

It was to the walkway that Miranda lead Misty, the old staircase protesting 
their passage with loud creaking sounds as the sound of the surf battered the 
unpleasant looking beach below.

&quot;When the tide&#39;s high,&quot; the courier explained, &quot;the water comes up to within a 
few feet of here.&quot;

&quot;Ever have any problem with flooding?&quot; Misty inquired, running her hand along 
the guardrail as she watched the sea below.

&quot;Not really,&quot; Miranda replied with a shrug, her voice growing distant as they 
drew closer to an area where the wall of rock gave way to an enormous, yet 
shallow cave, &quot;Hm. Okay, we&#39;re here. Watch your step...&quot;

It wasn&#39;t long before Misty could see why the sea wasn&#39;t a problem. The walkway 
terminated at the mouth of the cave, and a set of stone steps, carved straight 
from the rock lead them up an incline to where the darkness of the cave 
dispelled most of the natural light. 

&quot;That&#39;s strange,&quot; commented Misty, shivering against the cold and trying to make 
out the odd markings on the wall before her as Miranda fiddled with a 
flashlight.

&quot;My grandfather did those,&quot; Miranda replied quietly, her voice echoing slightly 
as the enormous set of double doors before them were illuminated in all their 
splendor.

They stood nearly twelve feet in height, made of the same dark mithril that was 
found in the Lavender Mountains. As Miranda had said, her paternal grandfather 
had done a great deal of work on the doors in his time. The main focus was of 
the two dragonites who stood facing one another with blissful expressions of 
love upon their faces as a swarm of their dratini children slithered and coiled 
about, forming decorative patterns. 

&quot;He worked on this nearly everyday after he retired,&quot; Miranda continued as 
Misty&#39;s eyes followed the patterns, observing the small shapes of fish leaping 
from unseen waters as the young dragons chased them.

&quot;It must have taken him forever,&quot; she commented as Miranda pulled an enormous 
skeleton key out of her coat pocket and held it before her as she walked 
forward.

&quot;He never finished it,&quot; the courier said sadly as the circle of light shifted, 
causing the edges of the door to became more apparent, their depicted scenes 
left incomplete, yet still compelling, &quot;My father said that it&#39;s better this 
way-&quot; she slotted the key into the ornate lock near the feet of the two dragons 
&quot;-it makes it seem as though his father&#39;s coming back one day to finish it...&quot; 

Miranda took a deep breath before turning the heavy key. Within the doors, the 
mechanism made awful grinding noises of protest, but after a moment they were 
followed by a loud, almost booming -clunk- as the lock settled into place.

&quot;They&#39;re still beautiful,&quot; assured Misty as the courier put away the key before 
sliding her hand behind one of the intricate carvings and giving the door a 
sharp pull.

&quot;I know,&quot; grunted Miranda as the door swung open with surprising ease, &quot;And the 
hinges my dad made aren&#39;t too bad either!&quot;

Misty chuckled as the courier dragged the door most of the way open, but had to 
quickly hold her nose as the dank smell of decay and neglect issued forth from 
the interior.

&quot;Give it a minute,&quot; commented Miranda, her arms suddenly going around Misty and 
holding her protectively.

&quot;This was a happy place once, right?&quot; Misty inquired after a moment of standing 
in the dear darkness, &quot;You didn&#39;t always keep the doors sealed and unvisited, 
did you?&quot;

&quot;Goodness no,&quot; chuckled Miranda sadly, &quot;when Selece and Undine lived here, we 
didn&#39;t need to lock it. Generally speaking a twelve-foot tall, five hundred plus 
pound dragons tend to deter thieves. And with two of them guarding their eggs, 
you&#39;d have to be crazy to burst in and try anything.&quot;

&quot;But they&#39;d make a tempting target for &#39;you know who&#39;,&quot; Misty muttered bitterly, 
immediately regretting the comment as Miranda stiffened, &quot;Oh! I&#39;m sorry-!&quot;

&quot;No, no,&quot; the woman assured her, &quot;It&#39;s true. A mated pare of dragonites living 
so close to humans, laying a clutch of eggs every five years or so does make a 
tempting target. And that&#39;s what started all this...&quot;

&quot;So, um, what did you do with the other dratini&#39;s that were born here?&quot; Misty 
inquired, changing the subject before Miranda became to upset.

&quot;Oh, for the most part we let them go,&quot; the courier replied with a shrug, &quot;We 
gave away two or three here and there, but the others we let leave when they 
were old enough. They&#39;re an endangered species by any standards, and we wanted 
to do your part to make sure they didn&#39;t become extinct. I suppose the group 
that hatched before Umi&#39;s clutch have all evolved by now. And the ones before 
them will probably be laying their eggs in the Spring.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a nice thought,&quot; smiled Misty, thinking about the swarms of dratini that 
would one day populate the coastal waters of some far off island, away from 
humans and their problems.

Miranda nodded, shining her flashlight beyond the doors and giving the air a 
careful sniff. &quot;Okay,&quot; she said, steeling herself against what was to come, &quot;It 
should be alright now.

Her lover glanced over, anxious to catch a glimpse into the private lives of the 
creatures that once dwelt beyond the doors. &quot;I don&#39;t know if the lights&#39;ll still 
work though,&quot; Miranda added, taking Misty by the hand and leading to the 
threshold, &quot;But if not, there should still be some torches I can light.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not worried,&quot; replied Misty, her curiosity becoming overwhelming as Miranda 
stepped carefully from the rock-strewn floor, and out onto soft, cool sands 
within the room.

Miranda nodded, taking a deep breath as she found a large lever on the wall near 
the door. &quot;Just be sure to get out of here if the lighting system explodes,&quot; she 
chuckled nervously, and yanked the lever up before pushing it into place.

For a moment, nothing happened, but then, as the low hum of electricity filled 
the echoing cavern, several well placed, but dim lights flared to life, with 
only a few exploding with loud popping sounds in protest.

&quot;That should do it,&quot; Miranda said quietly as the cavern was filled with an 
eerie, yet almost natural looking light, revealing its expansive sand covered 
floor, and high vaulted ceiling that could have contained Miranda&#39;s entire 
house. 

&quot;It&#39;s huge!&quot; commented Misty, her voice echoing loudly as she walked deeper into 
the cave, suddenly noticing the peculiar patterns in sand. The trails of 
footprints that staggered about, the long stretch where the sand parted, blown 
to either side, reviling the stone floor beneath. The splatterings of dried 
blood that still clung darkly and ominously to the sand, the peculiar patch 
where it had been turned to glass, &quot;Oh... Oh, Miri!&quot;

Miranda didn&#39;t hear her, the courier&#39;s senses felt clouded as a numbness 
suddenly overcame her and she slumped to her knees, her vision blurring with 
tears. &quot;I- I can see it...&quot; she choked, not really feeling Misty&#39;s arms around 
her, nearly unaware of her beloved&#39;s suddenly worried tone, &quot;I can see it all 
now. The patterns of their footprints. The broken egg shells. Those little holes 
in the far wall... All the blood. I can see it here, Misty. I can see how it all 
happened...&quot;

***

The sun was setting as they stood at the top of the stairs, their arms about 
each other, watching the sky change from blue to a combination of orange and 
violet on the horizon. &quot;It won&#39;t be long now,&quot; said Vivian, sighing heavily as 
her head rested against her husband&#39;s chest, her eyes tracking the movements of 
a distant flock of sea birds.

The tall man smiled, hugging his beloved a little closer at the thought of the 
controlled chaos of a half dozen new born dratini&#39;s slithering about the cavern 
below, driving their parents crazy yet again.

&quot;It&#39;ll be a learning experience for Miri, I suppose,&quot; Nicholas said 
thoughtfully, &quot;If she wants to carry on after us, she&#39;d best learn everything 
she can about dragons.&quot;

Vivian glanced up at her husband, smiling mysteriously. &quot;Oh?&quot; she inquired, her 
tone sounding slightly disappointed, &quot;I thought you were planning on living 
forever? I know I am.&quot;

Laughter had always come easily to her husband, and now was no exception. &quot;I 
would,&quot; he said at last, leaning in closer so that their lips almost touched, 
&quot;But I have this horrible feeling that eternity isn&#39;t long enough to show you 
how much I love you.&quot;

Vivian sighed contentedly, giving him a gentle kiss. &quot;We&#39;ll see then, now won&#39;t 
we?&quot; she chuckled, taking her husband&#39;s hand and beginning to lead him away.

&quot;Viv, wait!&quot; Nicholas whispered, his voice loosing all levity as the woman 
turned around to face him, her long dark hair spinning about her as she magenta 
eyes went from joyful to serious.

&quot;What is it?&quot; she inquired suspiciously as her husband closed his eyes and 
listened carefully, trying to hear something over the sound of the sea as the 
tide came in.

Nicholas raised his index finger to signal that he needed a moment, but the 
noise that met both their ears needed no concentration to be heard. The shrill 
tones of bellowed warnings suddenly echoed from the cavern below them, sending 
unpleasant chills down their spines. 

&quot;Undine!&quot; Vivian exclaimed, letting go of Nicholas&#39;s hand and sprinting over to 
where they&#39;d parked the car before hitting the concealed latch that would spring 
the trunk open.

&quot;Hold on!&quot; her husband called as loud as he could, leaning over the guardrail 
and bellowing for all he was worth, only to have his call be answered by a loud 
angry sound. 

&quot;They&#39;re in trouble!&quot; he called back to Vivian as she ran up to him, his cloudy 
gray eyes full of panic, &quot;They need us!&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; replied Vivian, trying to both remain in control and sound reassuring 
as she checked the sword she&#39;d grabbed from the trunk, &quot;Now let&#39;s go!&quot;

Nicholas nodded, feeling half helpless as he followed his wife down the rickety 
wooden steps two at a time. 

But as they neared the walkway, with the rising tide only a meter or so below 
it, a raised human voice rang out as a warning to others. &quot;They&#39;re here!&quot; it 
shouted, just before a peculiar rush of air sound filled their ears, and a 
silvery blur raced towards them.

&quot;Nicholas!&quot; exclaimed Vivian, turning on her heel without thinking as she 
grabbed her oncoming husband and threw them both off the staircase towards the 
ocean below.

He had little time to argue, for as they fell, the staircase behind them 
exploded into splinters along with a portion of the cliff face. &quot;I missed!&quot; the 
voice called again as the Lilcamps hit the water and struggled against the 
rising water back toward the walkway.

&quot;Hold on!&quot; sputtered Vivian, as they treaded the icy cold water and waited for a 
large enough wave.

&quot;Viv!&quot; exclaimed Nicholas, grabbing wife&#39;s hand and pulling her out of the way 
just as something tore a hole through the walkway with something that splashed 
down near where her head had been, &quot;Gun!&quot;

Vivian cursed under her breath, pulling Nicholas under the walkway as the sound 
of the assailant&#39;s booted feet stomped above them and the loud click of his 
revolver sounded once more. 

They both jumped involuntarily as the gun fired, ripping a second hole in the 
wood, and ricocheting off the rocky wall. &quot;That&#39;s two...&quot; Vivian muttered under 
her voice as they swam away from their current position and waited. 

&quot;Three...&quot; she muttered nervously as a bullet hit the water two meters away and 
Nicholas pulled a pokeball from his coat pocket. &quot;Nick!&quot; she whispered harshly, 
&quot;What are doing?!&quot;

&quot;Shh...&quot; he cautioned, certain that his plan would work before whipping the ball 
as hard as he could, sending it hurtling through the air to where it hit for 
what was them, the roof.

Instantly, the assailant fired his gun, thrice. 

&quot;Come on...&quot; Nicholas muttered through gritted teeth, the cold salt water 
causing him to shiver as he hoped his aim was true.

But as the ball hit the water, he realized that luck was on his side. With a 
click, it sprang open, sending its crimson wave of light straight up, through 
the openings between the wooden slats before rematerializing its occupant.

&quot;Treant!&quot; Nicholas exclaimed, &quot;he&#39;s trying to kill us!&quot;

&quot;What the heck is that-?!&quot; the assailant exclaimed as the sound of a speed 
loader clicked above them, followed by repeated gunfire and the shrill shrieking 
of a victreebel.

&quot;He&#39;s a plant, he&#39;ll be fine!&quot; assured Nicholas as he and Vivian swam further 
out to catch the large wave that was even now barreling towards them.

The sounds of gunfire were suddenly cut short by a man&#39;s panicked screams, 
suddenly silenced before being thrown over the edge some distance away. As the 
wave caught them, Nicholas noticed the way the man in the dark three-piece suit 
and dark sunglasses&#39; body seemed dangerously emaciated and pale. The pained 
expression on his face making him seem forty years older, and the near complete 
lack of colour to his skin and hair made Nicholas question whether he was even 
still alive.

Treant turned as the huge wave washed up behind him, awkwardly depositing the 
two humans, and shrieked a warning, all eight of his tendrils flailing 
dangerously, hungry for a fresh victim.

&quot;It&#39;s just us!&quot; his trainer called, eliciting a happy cry from the plant as he 
bounded over to the two humans and hugged them both with his vines. 

&quot;We don&#39;t have time for this!&quot; growled Vivian, her attention focused on the 
dragon&#39;s cave.

&quot;Get help!&quot; ordered Nicholas, &quot;Get Frank! Get Laurna!&quot;

The carnivorous pitcher-shaped plant nodded a confirmation, quickly letting the 
two humans go before attaching himself to the rock wall and climbing swiftly 
upwards using his tendrils like strong arms.

&quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot; replied Vivian, not waiting for back up as she drew her long, metal 
blade and ran full out towards the cavern.

Nicholas&#39;s eyes went wide for a moment as adrenaline filtered through his system 
when he realized that his wife had every intention of using the weapon. It 
wasn&#39;t simply the metal reinforced, sturdy wooden swords their couriers carried. 
It was an actual sword. A double-edged blade, forged from the mithril mined from 
the Lavender Mountains, meant for slaying Vivian&#39;s enemies, not simply stunning 
them into submission.

Just ahead of him, Vivian gripped the hilt of her sword a little tighter as she 
skidded to a halt and stared down the length of the short tunnel that lead to 
where they&#39;re dragons nested. To her surprise and intense anger, she could see 
three figures moving about the room. Two were distracting the dragons, moving 
about with what must have been well practiced leaps and dodges as Selece and 
Undine filled the room with focused bursts of searing flames. All the while, the 
third had succeeded in reaching the eggs, and was carefully loading them into a 
large metal crate. 

&quot;How dare you?!&quot; exclaimed Vivian, rushing into the room without a second 
thought, running straight towards the thin woman in the dark suit who was 
quickly stealing the dragonite&#39;s eggs.

&quot;Don&#39;t even think about it!&quot; the woman laughed, her dark eyes gleaming with 
malevolence as she picked up a peculiar looking rifle with a wide nozzle and a 
huge metal canister atop it, pointing it at the clutch of eggs.

Vivian cursed angrily, stopping in her tracks as a jet of liquid nitrogen flew 
past her, followed by a scream of pain from her dragonite. &quot;Undine!&quot; the woman 
exclaimed as she stared in horror at her wounded pokemon, &quot;Don&#39;t move!&quot;

&quot;Not a bad shot, if I do say so myself!&quot; laughed the tall, handsome man who&#39;d 
fired the blast as Selece angrily transposed himself between the human and 
Undine, his jaw clenched as flames licked at his bared razor sharp teeth. 

&quot;It&#39;ll be your last!&quot; promised Vivian running towards the gunman and only half 
hearing her husband&#39;s exclamation as he tackled the third thief to the ground 
from behind.

&quot;It&#39;s the-! The eggs!&quot; called Nicholas, quickly realizing that what he thought 
was simply an extremely short human, was actually a machop dressed in an Armani 
suit, &quot;They won&#39;t use their big techniques because of-!&quot;

Nicholas&#39;s words were suddenly cut off as the wiry reptile beneath him laughed 
and somehow managed to propel them both backwards off the ground, causing the 
human to land on his back before flipping over and grabbing Nicholas by the 
face.

&quot;I-! Ah-!&quot; he stammered, trying to bite the creature&#39;s scaly hand, distracting 
the machop long enough to take twin handfuls of sand and throw them into the 
pokemon&#39;s eyes.

Vivian heard the machop shriek in pain as she took a double-handed swing at the 
muscular grinning man with the ice-thrower. The weapon made a satisfying -
clunk!- as her sword cut it in half when he tried to parry with it, sending a 
spray of liquid nitrogen into the air.

She then heard a string of curses as she leaped out of the way while the man 
threw down the weapon and shielded his face. &quot;How do you like it?!&quot; Vivian 
exclaimed, coming to her feet as Selece took to the air and swooped forward, 
hissing angrily and preparing to add to the list of casualties. 

&quot;Victor!&quot; the haggard-looking woman with the eggs screamed as she snapped the 
lid shut on the crate, a look of sudden panic crossing her face as the gigantic 
blur that was Selece chomped down hard on the man&#39;s right arm before coming to 
an sudden and abrupt halt the way only a dragonite in flight could.

Victor staggered backwards, collapsing on the ground and holding the stump of 
his arm. &quot;Oh man,&quot; he muttered, &quot;this is REALLY going to hurt in the morning!&quot;

&quot;Now as for you!&quot; Vivian exclaimed angrily, both her and Selece turning towards 
the woman with angry glares.

&quot;Hm. Not so fast, missy,&quot; the woman chuckled, pointing her index finger subtly 
in Victor&#39;s direction.

It was with the utmost of astonishment that Vivian turned to victor and saw not 
a wounded man quickly bleeding to death on the sandy floor, but a wounded man 
who was calmly watching as a new hand sprouted from the stump the dragon&#39;s bite 
had left.

&quot;Neat trick, eh?&quot; he said with a wide grin, before punching Vivian as hard as he 
could in the jaw with his off hand...

Nicholas meanwhile, managed to throw off the machop, and had barely managed to 
struggle to his feet before the creature had kippupped and began racing blindly 
towards him once again. 

&quot;You don&#39;t give up easily, do you?!&quot; commented Nicholas rhetorically, turning 
and running towards his wife&#39;s dragonite. &quot;Undine!&quot; he called out, noting the 
frozen wing and gritting his teeth angrily, &quot;I need a hand!&quot;

The dragonite nodded, the pained expression upon her face becoming one of anger 
despite the tears in her sharp of her crimson glowing eyes as she inhaled 
sharply through her nostrils and expelled a sudden volt of electricity from the 
end of her open snout that arched over Nicholas&#39;s head before catching the 
machop in the chest.

The bipedal reptile didn&#39;t have a chance to dodge. The blast of electricity that 
caught him flowed through his body for several moments as it ground itself out, 
turning the sand around him to glass before sending the scaly lizard flying 
backwards through the air.

&quot;Way to go, babe!&quot; Nicholas laughed, stopping himself a few feet away from the 
dragonite as she growled at the still conscious machop, &quot;Now finish him off...!&quot;

Vivian, meanwhile, staggered back. The blow she&#39;d received nearly knocking her 
jaw out of alignment as she staggered back and instinctively touched the wound. 
&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; she growled with a bit of a laugh, noting the blood upon her fingers, 
&quot;Then try regenerating from this!&quot;

The woman took an angry one-handed swing with her sword, fully intending to lop 
the man&#39;s head from his shoulders, only to have him leap into the air, his legs 
kicking forward as the sword caught him across the stomach.

Victor made an unpleasant gurgling sound as his kick missed his opponent 
completely and he crumpled to the ground. &quot;Uhg,&quot; he replied, holding in several 
vital organs as Vivian turned her attention to the woman, &quot;This&#39;ll take a 
while...! Ow! Kathy? A little help here!&quot;

&quot;Oh, you&#39;ll be fine!&quot; laughed Kathy with a casual almost callous tone; already 
wielding her ice-thrower, &quot;Just give it a few minutes, dear.&quot;

&quot;So?&quot; inquired Vivian, spitting out one of her teeth, &quot;Can I see if you 
regenerate too?&quot;

Kathy glanced at the woman and the snarling dragonite beside her with a 
confident grin. &quot;Unfortunately, I don&#39;t,&quot; she assured them, glancing past Vivian 
to the open doorway, &quot;Victor may have been a successful experiment, but seeing 
as 99% of the test subjects died, I&#39;m not about to try the FEV serum out on 
myself. Besides, our ride&#39;s here!&quot;

From the doorway, a sudden burst of peculiar sounding gunfire filled the room, 
followed by a second scream from Undine and Nicholas&#39;s panicked exclamation. 

Vivian turned around in time to see several more people in dark suits, wielding 
strangely modified Tommy guns running into the cavern, firing shards of high 
velocity ice at Undine.

&quot;Selece!&quot; Nicholas exclaimed angrily as he ran across the sand expanse, covering 
his head as he ran forward amongst the strange gunfire, &quot;Protect Undine! Fire 
ball them into oblivion if you have to!&quot;

Vivian glanced at her husband in sudden shock. She&#39;d seen him angry only once in 
her life, and that had been protecting her. Now his anger had returned, not only 
to save her life, but the lives of their dragonites and their unhatched children 
as well.

Without hesitation, his dragonite turned around, stomping the ground angrily as 
he moved to face the attackers. With a growling roar, he let loose with a jet of 
flame that crossed the room before exploding in mid-air in front of the oncoming 
assailants.

There was a collective scream as the small group of dark suited men flew in all 
direction, their bodies scorched by the flames. Selece then bellowed in 
challenge at them as he lifted off the ground again, his seemingly small wings 
twitching slightly to achieve the effect before flying towards the survivors at 
his maximum velocity.

&quot;Viv!&quot; exclaimed Nicholas, immediately throwing himself to the ground and 
blocking his ears, as the huge dragon once more became a blur.

His wife needed no further prompting, without hesitation she followed suit and 
was pleased to see the baffled look upon Kathy&#39;s face as the unexpected sonic 
boom shook the entire cavern. 

The deafening thunder was quickly followed by a wall of sand that blinded 
everyone, and those that could still hear vaguely heard the sound of Selece 
extracting a terrible vengeance on anyone he could find in the cloud of dust and 
smoke.

&quot;Vivian!&quot; came Nicholas&#39;s voice through the haze a short time later.

&quot;Nick?&quot; she called back, coughing and casting her free arm about to dispel the 
dust, &quot;Where are you?&quot;

&quot;Over here-!&quot; he tried to reply, his voice suddenly becoming a terrible gurgling 
sound, followed by a dull thud.

&quot;Nicholas!&quot; Vivian exclaimed, rushing forward, ready to cut anyone who got in 
the way in half.

&quot;Machop!&quot; came an angry exclamation from behind her, causing Vivian to turn in 
mid-stride, intent on running the annoying reptile through. 

Instead however, she felt something impact hard against her back. There was a 
sickening -crack!- the woman was flung forward, landing face first in the sand 
as a blinding pain flooded her senses and Vivian felt as though her spine was on 
fire, and a thousand searing pins were driven into her vertebrae. 

&quot;Victor!&quot; she half heard Kathy shout over the renewed sound of gunfire and 
Selece&#39;s angry retorts. &quot;Help me with the eggs!&quot;

&quot;No...&quot; gasped Vivian, struggling just to open her eyes and catching a blurry 
glimpse of Victor hauling the crate into the air above his head like it was 
nothing. 

&quot;Maaa...&quot; commented the machop as his scaly feet suddenly stomped down, blocking 
Vivian&#39;s view.

&quot;Forget it, Tashiro!&quot; came Kathy&#39;s angrily shouted order. &quot;Help them with the 
dragonites! They&#39;re tougher than we anticipated!&quot;

The scaly pokemon glanced at his trainer with an angry glare for spoiling his 
fun, but quickly raced off nonetheless, allowing Vivian a glimpse of what she 
desperately hoped wasn&#39;t her husband. 

Lying not far away was Nicholas. He too had been struck from behind, only as he 
lie there, his body shaking every so often from the exertion of breathing, a 
long bladed dagger sprouted from his back.

&quot;No...&quot; whispered Vivian, unable raise her voice over the pain that flooded her 
mind, &quot;Nicholas, my love... No...&quot;

Somewhere behind her, she half heard Kathy curse as an explosion rocked the cave 
and Selece bellow angrily in sudden deep sorrow. &quot;You fool!&quot; the woman yelled 
angrily at her minions, &quot;You&#39;ve killed the female! We needed that one most of 
all-! Noooo!&quot;

Kathy&#39;s words were cut short, as the sound of grinding metal filled the air, 
followed by Selece&#39;s cry of anguish as he stomped down hard upon the crate that 
held the eggs rather than let the human thieves take them.

Vivian smiled in spite of the pain as she reached her hand out towards her 
fallen husband. &quot;You... You won&#39;t have them,&quot; she managed mutter in grim 
satisfaction, her fingers digging into the sand before pulling herself a painful 
inch closer to Nicholas.

&quot;You monster!&quot; exclaimed Kathy, ignoring the man beside her who suddenly found 
Selece&#39;s clawed foot propelling him backwards out the cavern entrance, &quot;How dare 
you destroy those eggs?!&quot;

Selece pivoted his head, glaring down at the woman with eyes that burned with 
the red and orange of anger. &quot;We needed those!&quot; Kathy continued, stomping her 
foot as several men in dark suits ran past her with a huge net, intent on 
encircling the dragonite, &quot;But now, now that your master is dead, I own you! Do 
you understand, you dumb beast?!&quot;

The dragonite merely snarled his reply before expelling another jet of flame 
down towards Kathy, only to have it met half way by a blast of liquid nitrogen. 
&quot;Obey me, monster!&quot; the woman yelled angrily, &quot;You are MY pokemon now! You are 
MY dragonite! Do you understand me?!&quot;

Selece bellowed out a defiant response, bracing himself as his relatively small 
wings flipped backward before flapping once, sending a hurricane force blast of 
wind forwards.

Kathy shrieked as she and her minions were all but blown out of the cave, and 
Selece&#39;s fire melted the sand where she had been before the enraged dragonite 
flew forward after them, still hungry for vengeance even as his last victim&#39;s 
tattered remnants hung wedged between his darkly stained teeth. Once outside, 
however, Vivian could hear Kathy&#39;s voice give one last terrible order.

&quot;Fine!&quot; the woman yelled, ignoring the protests of her minions, &quot;If he won&#39;t 
listen to me, then take him down!&quot;

Vivian closed here eyes, gritting her teeth and clenching fists as she heard 
Selece&#39;s dying screams amidst of the cacophony of automatic weapons fire and 
explosions. 

&quot;You- You&#39;ll pay for this...&quot; she promised, barely hearing the soft words spoken 
to her from several meters away.

&quot;Viv... Vivian...&quot; came her husband&#39;s pained voice.

Even as she opened her eyes again, Vivian could hear him crying. Not from the 
physical pain he felt, but because he&#39;d failed Selece. &quot;Nick...&quot; his wife called 
out weakly as the sound of motorboats signaled that the surviving attackers were 
cutting their losses and fleeing before help arrived.

Nicholas looked up, his gray eyes full of tears, and smiled at his beloved 
weakly. &quot;Viv?&quot; he asked, trying unsuccessfully not to sound sad, &quot;Are we... Are 
we still going to live forever?&quot;

&quot;Shh, don&#39;t- Don&#39;t try to talk,&quot; Vivian replied, gritting her teeth and 
desperately pushing down the pain as she reached out with both hands to drag 
herself across the ground towards him, &quot;Just- Ow! Lie still...&quot;

All she could hear now was the sound of the man&#39;s ragged breathing as it began 
to slow, giving Vivian the desperate strength she needed to continue as the pain 
along her spine grew worse. 

&quot;Viv...&quot; came his quite reply once more as Nicholas lifted his head and watched 
Vivian drag herself forward, painfully making her spinal injuries worse as she 
did so in a desperate attempt to reach him, to hold him one last time, &quot;Please. 
Don&#39;t move...&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; she cried defiantly, the pain focusing her mind as Vivian gritted her 
teeth and forced herself to cover the remaining distance more quickly before 
collapsing once again, &quot;I... I love you too much...&quot;

Vivian closed her eyes, about ready to accept defeat when she felt the light 
touch of her beloved&#39;s fingers upon her hand. &quot;Vivian,&quot; he called out weakly, 
causing the woman to look up in time to see Nicholas looking back at her 
adoringly, &quot;I- I love you too...&quot;

&quot;I said don&#39;t talk,&quot; she whispered back, smiling sadly through clenched teeth as 
tears burned in her eyes, &quot;Don&#39;t you ever listen?&quot;

&quot;Never,&quot; he chuckled, only to have his reply cut short by a coughing fit that 
made his wife&#39;s heart nearly break. &quot;Vivian,&quot; he said at last, the gleam in his 
cloudy grey eyes fading, &quot;Promise... Promise me something.&quot;

Vivian held his gaze for a moment; half noticing as the pain in her lower back 
began to be replaced by a dull numbness. &quot;Anything,&quot; she promised sincerely, 
&quot;Anything, my love!&quot;

Nicholas smiled at her one last time and said, &quot;Please. Please just be happy, 
Vivian... That&#39;s all that ask of you, my love...&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Vivian pleaded, dragging herself further towards him and shaking his 
suddenly lifeless shoulder, &quot;Nicholas, no! Don&#39;t you dare die on me...&quot;

Vivian dropped her head onto the sand, crying as she stared numbly at her 
husband, listening dispassionately to the sound of approaching footsteps. &quot;Very 
well, my love,&quot; she whispered as she heard her sister&#39;s startled cry from across 
the cavern followed Frank&#39;s sudden angry exclamation, &quot;I shall do as you ask... 
farewell, my dearest love...&quot; 

***

Miranda opened her eyes, looking out at the blurry image of the empty cavern 
with its peculiar blend of footprints and scorch marks. For a moment, she felt 
numb all over. But soon the feeling of her tears on her face and Misty&#39;s arms 
around her brought the courier back to reality.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she whispered, leaning into her beloved&#39;s embrace, &quot;I- I just 
didn&#39;t know how bad this place really was...&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s alright,&quot; replied Misty, her quiet voice soothing as she ran her 
fingers affectionately through Miranda&#39;s hair to calm her, &quot;You&#39;ve been carrying 
a lot of tears around for a long time, and eventually you had to let them go. 
Don&#39;t worry, worry, Miri. I&#39;m here for you.&quot;

Miranda nodded slowly, wishing her stomach would stop tying itself in knots. 
&quot;Tha-thank you,&quot; she breathed, feeling as though all the moisture in her entire 
body had leaked out her eyes, &quot;I- I guess that I wasn&#39;t as prepared for this as 
I&#39;d thought. I haven&#39;t been here since before the incident, and I thought I 
could handle it. Oh well. I guess not...&quot;

&quot;You handled it as well as anyone could have expected you to,&quot; Misty replied, 
her fingers slipping under Miranda&#39;s chin to turn her head to make eye contact, 
&quot;I don&#39;t expect you to be a rock. I knew when we came to Lavender that you&#39;d get 
a little upset now and then. It&#39;s okay. You wouldn&#39;t be human otherwise.&quot;

The courier smiled weakly. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said, struggling to her feet as 
Misty handed her back her glasses, &quot;But what do you say we try and spend the 
rest of today happy? I think I&#39;ve had enough sadness for one lifetime.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m here for,&quot; chuckled Misty, her arm linking through Miranda&#39;s.

&quot;To make me sad, or make me happy?&quot; Miranda teased, wiping her eyes clear before 
donning her glasses.

&quot;To make you as miserable as humanly possible!&quot; Mist laughed, nearly falling 
over as Miranda flung her arms about her, laughing as well.

&quot;Oh good,&quot; continued Miranda, her mood brightening, &quot;I could use some misery, 
I&#39;ve had far too much of this &#39;love and happiness&#39; business!&quot;

&quot;Alright then,&quot; chuckled Misty, winding her way out of her lover&#39;s embrace and 
taking the courier&#39;s hand, &quot;Let&#39;s go shop for some unhappy flour, and miserable 
eggs, and um... I think Bob said he needed tomatoes?&quot;

&quot;Are they angst-ridden tomatoes?&quot; 

Misty gave her beloved a bemused look, trying for a moment to think of a 
suitable response, but quickly gave up. &quot;That&#39;s it, let&#39;s go!&quot; she ordered, 
grabbing Miranda by both hands and all but dragging her out of the cavern as the 
courier&#39;s laughter echoed off the vaulted ceiling...</pre>
