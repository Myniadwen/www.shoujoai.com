<h1>Cerulean Dreams (part 5 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nikolai.html">Nikolai Mirovich</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/cerulean-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Miranda awoke the next day by the method she liked the least; the 
blinding morning sun shining directly into her eyes making it 
impossible to stay in bed. With a grumble she lowered her head in 
an attempt to go back to sleep, only to hear a loud -thunk!- as 
her forehead knocked against something at least as hard as it was.

With a quiet curse the courier opened her eyes and suddenly 
remembered where she was. Before her was Misty, until seconds 
before dozing contentedly in her arms only to be awaked by an 
unexpected collision.

&quot;Oh, well good morning to you too,&quot; commented Misty wryly, rubbing 
her forehead and opening one eye.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; replied Miranda, brushing her lover&#39;s hair out of her eye 
and kissing her on the forehead, &quot;I don&#39;t usually don&#39;t hurt 
people to wake them up.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s alright,&quot; assured Misty, snuggling closer and closing her 
eyes again, &quot;We only have a few minutes left any way.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; inquired Miranda, her arms giving Misty a gentle hug to 
alleviate her sudden need to do so.

Misty nodded, opening her eyes again as she listened to the quiet 
sounds coming from the rest of the building. &quot;Listen,&quot; she 
whispered as the sound of arguing voices carried from down the 
hall and through the door to Misty&#39;s bedroom, &quot;It&#39;s like that 
every morning.&quot;

For several minutes, the two lied quietly, listening to the sounds 
of the three sisters arguing over some trivial matter. Violet&#39;s 
voice was easiest to make out, not necessarily being the loudest, 
but certainly the most authoritative. The argument seemed to be 
going in her favor, which was no surprise to Misty, as the eldest 
of the sisters was also the most manipulative. Lily seemed to be 
the one doing most of the arguing, however, being Violet&#39;s main 
rival and contender for &#39;head of the family&#39;. Daisy, though, was 
the least vocal of the terrible trio, seeming to only interject 
when things got too out of hand or when she really had something 
important to say.

&quot;They&#39;ll stop when we go out there,&quot; commented Misty, stretching 
out but feeling no actual desire to get out of bed. 

&quot;I know,&quot; said Miranda with a nod, feeling a touch guilty as she 
realized that the three sisters were arguing about who&#39;d left a 
mess in the kitchen the night before.

&quot;We might as well get this over with then,&quot; Misty grumbled before 
noticing the look that crossed her lover&#39;s face, &quot;Hey, what&#39;s 
wrong?&quot;

Miranda shrugged, her gaze a little distant. &quot;This is what I&#39;ve 
always hated about staying at other people&#39;s places,&quot; she 
explained with a weak smile, her glaze moving to catch Misty&#39;s, 
&quot;Every morning it seems like their arguing about something I did.&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s alright,&quot; assured Misty, brushing Miranda&#39;s bangs out of 
her eyes, &quot;They&#39;re always this way, and we might as well put a 
stop to it right now.&quot;

&quot;As you wish,&quot; agreed Miranda with a smile, kissing Misty lightly 
on the nose before reluctantly tossing back the blankets and 
shivering against the sudden chill.

&quot;Say, do you think they&#39;ll remember you?&quot; asked Misty with an 
amused grin as she rifled through the pile of clothing the two had 
left beside the bed.

&quot;Only one way to find out,&quot; chuckled Miranda, reaching onto the 
night stand for her glasses, &quot;If not, I&#39;ll just as Violet how 
Gary&#39;s doing.&quot;

&quot;Do it anyway,&quot; laughed Misty, standing up to get dressed, &quot;But 
seriously, let&#39;s hurry. I&#39;d just like to get this over with...&quot;

***

&quot;Misty!&quot; came the ringing chorus of happy voices that oozed all 
the insincerity of a scripted greeting as the two stepped into the 
living room.

&quot;Oh, like we&#39;re sooo happy that you&#39;re awake!&quot; commented Violet, 
gliding across the room with open arms, &quot;Welcome home!&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; inquired Lily, looking over her sister&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Who&#39;s 
your friend?&quot;

&quot;You guys remember Miranda, don&#39;t you?&quot; asked Misty, accepting a 
sisterly hug that was almost choreographed in it&#39;s 
pretentiousness. 

&quot;Hey, like I remember you,&quot; laughed Daisy, getting out of the 
comfortable chair she&#39;d taken refuge in, &quot;Like your dratini 
totally annihilated my shellder last time you were here for a 
badge battle!&quot;

Miranda smiled, bowing her head to hide her amusement. &quot;Yes,&quot; she 
said softly, &quot;Just try using an ice attack next time, okay?&quot;

&quot;Oh!&quot; exclaimed Violet, here eyes gleaming darkly as she turned to 
face the courier, &quot;You were that girl who came here with that guy 
from Pallet... What was his name again, Lily?&quot;

&quot;I- I&#39;m sure I can&#39;t remember,&quot; stammered her sister, her face 
turning almost as red as her hair.

Violet smirked and held out her hand. &quot;Pleased to meet you again,&quot; 
she said with a smile that almost seemed predatory, showing far 
more teeth than was necessary, &quot;Sorry about us being a little 
disorganized today, but as always our thoughtless little sister 
just dropped in unexpectedly.&quot;

&quot;Like, yeah,&quot; added Lily as Misty glared at the both of them and 
Miranda gritted her teeth, not wanted to seem like an ungracious 
guest, &quot;And she didn&#39;t even tell us she was bringing a guest!&quot;

&quot;Stop it!&quot; exclaimed Misty angrily; clenching her fists as she 
almost growled out her words, &quot;I absolutely hate it when you talk 
about me like I&#39;m not even in the room!&quot;

&quot;Like, take a chill pill, little sister,&quot; commented Lily, 
seemingly offended even as Miranda slipped her fingers through 
Misty&#39;s and gave her hand a reassuring squeeze.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; added Daisy, shaking her head in mock disbelief, &quot;We were 
just trying to make your guest feel totally welcome.&quot;

&quot;Then I thank you all for your hospitality,&quot; said Miranda, biting 
back the sudden urge to put the three spoilt brats in their place, 
and keeping her voice surprisingly level, &quot;But if you&#39;d like, I&#39;m 
sure we could find other accommodations.&quot;

&quot;Oh! No, no, no!&quot; assured Violet with a laugh, waving her hands 
before her enthusiastically, &quot;Please feel free to stay as long as 
you want. I&#39;m sure we can find an extra cot in storage for you to 
sleep on in the future, though. I&#39;m sure Misty&#39;s floor was 
extremely uncomfortable-&quot;

&quot;Actually,&quot; interrupted Misty, a wide grin crossing her face as 
she saw the expressions on her siblings faces change subtly, &quot;We 
simply shared my bed. It&#39;s a little cramped, but we&#39;re used to 
sleeping fairly close together. Now then, I&#39;d like to see my 
pokemon if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;

Miranda clenched her teeth and tightened her facial muscles to 
keep from laughing as she glanced at Misty. &#39;Such a brave, 
wonderful person she is,&#39; thought the courier as a feeling of 
pride filtered through her amusement, &#39;How can I not lover you?&#39;

&quot;Hold on,&quot; assured Daisy, collecting her wits first and taking the 
opportunity to leave the room, heading down the hall, &quot;I&#39;ll just 
go fetch your starmie from the aquarium!&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re both become very close friends then?&quot; inquired Violet, 
turning around and walking towards the door to the gym area below 
to hide her expression.

&quot;Very close,&quot; assured Misty, grinning to hide her embarrassment, 
but still enjoying the effect it was having on her sibling, 
&quot;Miranda&#39;s really turned my life around.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; commented Lily, picking up a tall glass from an end table 
and taking a long sip as Misty took hold of Miranda&#39;s arm and 
leaned against her happily, &quot;Well, like congratulations then.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; added the eldest of the Cerulean sisters, her voice 
wavering ever so slightly as she slid open the door, pausing at 
the threshold, &quot;Congratulations...&quot;

&quot;Here we go!&quot; exclaimed Daisy, bounding back into the living room 
wielding a dripping wet pokeball, &quot;One starmie, as promised!&quot;

&quot;Oh good!&quot; laughed Misty, releasing Miranda and grabbing the 
pokeball, practically yanking her sister&#39;s hand off in the 
process. &quot;Oh! I&#39;ve missed you sooo much!&quot; the trainer told the 
pokemon within as she held it against her cheek and smiled 
contentedly, &quot;But I&#39;ll never leave you again, I promise!&quot;

&quot;Like, it&#39;s just an overgrown starfish,&quot; sneered Violet before 
taking the opportunity to stomp off down the stairs.

&quot;Strange,&quot; commented Miranda to the now empty doorway, &quot;I thought 
you guys liked water-types.&quot;

&quot;Oh, we do,&quot; assured Lily, chuckling nervously, &quot;It&#39;s just that 
Misty&#39;s starmie won&#39;t really listen to anyone but her.&quot;

&quot;Can you blame her?&quot; chuckled Misty, cutting short her happy 
reunion as her other two siblings made their way to the door.

&quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; assured Miranda, taking Misty&#39;s hand again and giving 
it a squeeze.

&quot;You&#39;re only saying that because you&#39;re in love with me,&quot; chuckled 
Misty, raising their joined hands to her lips and giving Miranda&#39;s 
a fingers a quick kiss before leading her from the room, &quot;Now come 
on, I want you to meet my two long lost pokemon.&quot;

***

At Misty&#39;s command, the pokeball sprang open and her starmie 
materialized within the calm waters of the Olympic sized swimming 
pool next to her overjoyed looking horsea. &quot;Miss me, guys?&quot; the 
trainer laughed, leaning forward and smiling happily at the 
pokemon.

&quot;Is there any doubt?&quot; inquired Miranda in amusement as the two 
water-types called out their agreement.

&quot;I&#39;m so glad you did, even if I missed you more,&quot; said Misty with 
smile she couldn&#39;t suppress before motioning to Miranda, &quot;But I 
think it&#39;s time you two meet my friend here.&quot;

&quot;Hi,&quot; the courier replied simply, smiling a little as she gave a 
short wave, &quot;I&#39;m Miranda, but I think you&#39;d like my friend Umi 
more.&quot;

&quot;Hey, good point,&quot; chuckled Misty as Miranda held out a pokeball 
that was black on top and gray on the bottom and activated the 
release mechanism, &quot;Hey wait! That&#39;s not-!&quot;

There was a surprised sound from the cloud of dark smoke that 
materialized from the ball, and a shriek of panic from Misty&#39;s 
horsea as Wraith collected himself and stared down at the water 
curiously. &quot;Gaaa?&quot; he inquired, swiveling to face Miranda with a 
questioning look. 

&quot;Oops! Sorry,&quot; apologized Miranda with a hint of amusement at the 
way Misty&#39;s sisters suddenly went into a controlled panic, &quot;I 
wasn&#39;t paying attention...&quot;

The courier held out the ball once more, intent on returning the 
ghost, not noticing the rather odd noise the nearly terrified 
horsea made before a blob of something dark wet and sticky flew in 
Wraith&#39;s direction.

&quot;Gassst!&quot; the ghost exclaimed in alarm, throwing up a shall 
telekinetic barrier as the blast hit, harmlessly deflecting most 
of the horsea&#39;s ink-jet attack but sending one blob of oily, black 
ooze sailing towards his trainer.

&quot;Ahh!&quot; exclaimed Miranda, dropping her pokeball in surprise as she 
found a rather large, and particularly cold wet stain form on her 
shirt.

&quot;Miranda!&quot; yelped Misty, turning to help, but pausing as she saw 
how little damage had been done, instead turning bravely towards 
the gastly. &quot;You!&quot; she scolded, collecting all her courage to 
chastise the little ghost, &quot;You&#39;re supposed to protect your 
trainer, not humiliate her!&quot;

&quot;Wra...&quot; pouted Wraith, looking downcast and fading into 
invisibility even as he floated over to his trainer and nuzzled 
her shoulder.

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; laughed Miranda as Misty&#39;s sisters hurried over, &quot;I&#39;m 
fine. I&#39;ve had worse things happen to my clothing.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m, like, sure we can lend you something to replace it,&quot; offered 
Lily, suddenly taking a step back as Miranda reached out with her 
hand and petted something that didn&#39;t appear to be there.

&quot;And you can take a quick bath before that stuff stains your 
skin,&quot; added Violet a little too hastily as Miranda whispered a 
few reassuring words to her saddened, invisible gastly.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; the woman replied glancing at Misty, &quot;I take it you&#39;d 
like to bond for a while?&quot;

Her lover nodded with an amused smile. &quot;Yeah, and I&#39;d like to 
borrow Umi too if I could,&quot; she replied, kneeling down to pet her 
horsea reassuringly, &quot;But I&#39;ll join you next time.&quot;

Miranda chuckled quietly and nodded before returning Wraith and 
actually looking carefully at the second pokeball with its blue 
and white colour combination. &quot;Alright, Umi,&quot; she called as the 
dratini&#39;s ball snapped open and sent out its curious luminescence, 
&quot;time to make some new friends!&quot;

The serpent appeared a short distance above the water, but dove in 
happily without missing a beat. A moment later she popped her head 
out near the edge of the pool and looked up at Miranda 
imploringly. &quot;Dra?&quot; inquired Umi hopefully.

&quot;No, sorry, dear,&quot; her trainer replied with a sad smile, &quot;Maybe 
next time. But I&#39;m sure Misty&#39;ll go swimming with you while I&#39;m 
gone.&quot; &quot;Now then,&quot; asked Miranda, turning towards Violet, you said 
I could take a quick bath?&quot;

&quot;Ah yes, this way,&quot; the woman explained with a conniving glance in 
Misty&#39;s direction, &quot;I&#39;ll arrange something to put on when she&#39;s 
done, like okay?&quot;

&quot;Have fun,&quot; commented Misty giving a small, sad wave as Miranda 
was lead off, causing her to wonder what horrors awaited her, 
&quot;We&#39;ll miss you!&quot;

&quot;If I&#39;m not back in an day, you can keep Umi,&quot; the courier 
chuckled as Misty laughed at the comment and the little dragon let 
out a long sad sound as her trainer followed Violet up the long 
flight of stairs...

***

The room illuminated automatically as Miranda slid the door open 
and entered, filling the room with soft light. &quot;Gee,&quot; she 
commented, noticing not only the raised dais upon which the sunken 
bathtub rested, but also the expansive dressing table, crowded 
with every conceivable beauty product on the planet, and equipped 
with a large mirror surrounded by clear round light bulbs, &quot;They 
really take this stuff seriously!&quot;

With a chuckle, Miranda walked up the tiled steps to where the 
bathtub dwelt. It seemed deep enough to fully submerse herself in, 
and spacious enough to hold at least another person comfortably. 
The waterspout was designed in the shape of a seadra, the two 
faucets on either side turning easily to expel a combination of 
hot and cold water into the tub.

&quot;I should have known,&quot; the woman commented with a smile as her the 
water ran between her fingers, the temperature near perfect, &quot;In a 
city obsessed with water, you can always bathe comfortably.&quot;

Miranda shook her hand dry and walked to the dressing table, 
noticing the small bench that had been pushed underneath it. 
&quot;Well, that&#39;ll take a while,&quot; she commented to her reflection, 
reaching under to pull out the padded bench and sat herself in 
front of the mirror, &quot;Might as well take my time.&quot;

With a gentle push against the far wall with her feet, Miranda 
moved the seat back a bit further and spun around to face the bath 
as she disrobed. &quot;I really should be more careful,&quot; she muttered 
to herself, holding out the front of her shirt and shaking her 
head at the ink stain, &quot;I just hope Umi&#39;s okay out there.&quot;

After removing her shirt, Miranda hung it on a small hook on the 
side of the dressing table to dry and went about detaching the 
three pokeballs from her belt. &quot;But what to do with you two 
trouble makers?&quot; she inquired in a maternal tone before setting 
the two occupied and one empty ball down on the table behind her, 
&quot;Naw, unleashing Wraith into their computer system and Nezumi into 
their kitchen would be mean.&quot;

She then stood up and undid her pants so that they could fall to 
the floor at her feet, before undoing her necklace and setting it 
carefully on the counter beside the pokeballs. &quot;Ah, freedom,&quot; 
chuckled Miranda, stretching out her arms, rotating her shoulder 
muscles before pulling down her undergarments and taking a good 
look at what the not-so sensational Cerulean Sisters considered 
bathroom necessities.

&quot;&#39;Serene Seel Bubble Bath&#39;,&quot; read Miranda aloud as she picked up 
the first bottle she found, &quot;I guess that&#39;s not such a bad idea. 
Oh, and &#39;Happy Jynx Hair Care&#39;? Um, maybe not.&quot;

Miranda picked up the second bottle and shook her head in dismay. 
&quot;I&#39;m glad Lavender Town isn&#39;t this bad,&quot; she commented, finally 
settling on a bottle of shampoo that didn&#39;t have a cheesy 
marketing ploy, &quot;I can see it now, &#39;Gengar Toothpaste! Keeps your 
teeth as white as a corpse, or your money back! Oh well...&quot; 

The courier turned her attention back to the filling bathtub and 
was pleased to find it nearly done, the waterspout doing its job 
rather efficiently. So, with only a moment&#39;s hesitation, she 
uncorked the bottle of bubble bath and moved to drop in a small 
amount. As promised on the label, thick suds immediately erupted 
from the churning waters, and by the time the tub was nearly full, 
Miranda began to wonder if she&#39;d over done it.

&quot;Good enough,&quot; she commented, shutting off the water and stepping 
carefully into the pleasantly warm water, prepared to enjoy the 
first real bath she&#39;d had in weeks.

As she settled in, the warm water already taking its soothing toll 
on her wary muscles and the suds making pleasant little 
crackling/popping noises, Miranda closed her eyes and sighed 
contentedly. &quot;Showers just can&#39;t compare to this,&quot; the courier 
whispered to herself, casually slipping off her glasses and 
putting them on the edge of the tub before holding her breath and 
sliding beneath the calm waters.

Once submerged, the ambient sounds of the Cerulean City Gym 
banished from her ears, and only the warm caress of the gently 
moving water filled her senses. Within seconds Miranda felt all 
her tension drift away. With a small smile, she folded her legs 
into a sitting position, allowing herself to float to the surface 
once she neared the limit of her stamina. 

The cooler air that touched her face felt like a welcome morning 
kiss as she broke the thin membrane of water-tension, and the 
fresh oxygen that filled her lungs seemed sweet. &quot;Misty,&quot; she 
whispered absently, feeling a subtle longing lurking quietly in 
the back of her mind, &quot;I love you...&quot;

Leaning her head back against gently curved rim of the tub, 
Miranda let her mind wander. With a small sigh of contentment, she 
lifted her knees once more, but not enough for them to leave the 
water&#39;s warm comfort.

&#39;Mmm, this is nice,&#39; the woman thought wistfully, brushing her 
dark wet hair over her ears with both hands before slowly dragging 
her fingers downward, gently caressing the tension from her neck.

In her mind, Miranda imagined the touch was Misty&#39;s. Her lover&#39;s 
hands slowly weaving their way downward, pausing only to gently 
cup her breasts and brush her fingers teasingly across Miranda&#39;s 
nipples.

&quot;Like that...&quot; she breathed, taking both nipples between her 
fingers and imagining Misty&#39;s pretty face leaning forward to tease 
Miranda with little kisses as she ran her fingers downward, gently 
tugging at them while whispering words of adoration.

Miranda let out a long slow breath; her head tilting to one side 
as she brought her hands down lower, giving in to her body&#39;s 
sudden need. &quot;Maybe I should save this passion for the real you,&quot; 
Miranda chuckled quietly, biting her lip as her fingers slid lower 
&quot;Or maybe not...&quot;

The courier held her breath as her fingertips teased her labia 
before both hands moved out to trace the length of her thighs, 
causing Miranda to shiver despite the warmth of the water. 
Miranda&#39;s inner thighs had always been a pleasurable weakness when 
caressed in the correct manner, and now she wished it were her 
lover&#39;s touch upon them, not her own.

&quot;I need you, dearest,&quot; said Miranda so quietly she barely even 
heard her own words, and as she brought a hand up to her breast to 
tease herself further, Miranda conjured an image in her mind of 
her beloved. 

She imagined a spacious room, whose far off walls and ceiling were 
enshrouded by both shadows and veils of coloured silk. The 
lighting was dim, provided candles whose flames somehow failed to 
burn anything but the wax, and cast strange shadows about the 
expansive room. The shadows themselves seemed to flit about, 
impatient for what was to come, intent on quietly observing. 

From somewhere, hidden behind thin walls whose colours ranged 
through all the spectrums of blue and purple, music played. It was 
soft, crossing Celtic and classical in a unity so perfect it 
rivaled the love Misty and Miranda felt for each other.

As Miranda approached the center of the room, the silken veils 
parted to allow her passage, obeying her unspoken command as she 
stepped barefoot across the marble floor that, strewn with rose 
petals. 

The courier closed her eyes, breathing in the sweet scent of the 
dying petals, and feeling the soft caress of the loose fitting 
robes she wore. The light material could have been silk, yet it 
clung to her more like solidified ephemera as she moved, trailing 
out behind the woman with every step, revealing the length of 
Miranda&#39;s legs as she walked.

When at last she had reached her destination Miranda paused, 
spreading her arms wide and leaning her head back with a contented 
smile. &quot;All this is for your benefit, my dearest love,&quot; Miranda 
said aloud, leaning her head forward and opening her eyes as she 
heard the quiet sound of Misty&#39;s breathing. What she then saw, 
made Miranda shiver, and almost laugh out loud as a way to release 
the sudden desire that flooded her senses even as the music 
reached a minor crescendo. 

Misty stood with her back to Miranda, her arms to her sides, her 
head held high and her orangish hair tied up, revealing her 
slender, ever so tempting neck. The only garment that she wore, 
however, was a long, loosely fitting robe of white silk that was 
so thin Miranda could just make out tantalizing, yet shadowy 
glimpses of Misty&#39;s body beneath.

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid,&quot; Miranda whispered, walking up behind Misty and 
speaking directly into her ear, &quot;I love you far too much to ever 
hurt you.&quot;

The girl nodded slowly, but was otherwise silent. Her only sounds 
the quiet moan she let out as Miranda&#39;s hands rested upon her 
strong shoulders for a moment before running down her back, the 
courier&#39;s skilled fingers seeking out the tension in Misty&#39;s 
muscles. As her lover leaned back in response to Miranda&#39;s touch, 
her hands moving slowly up and down her back, she rested her head 
against Miranda&#39;s chest and smiled up at her.

&quot;I love you,&quot; sighed Misty as Miranda&#39;s hands moved downward, 
taking her firm bottom in both hands and squeezing gently, causing 
Misty&#39;s eyes to flutter shut, and her voice to falter.

&quot;I know,&quot; Miranda soothed, bowing her head to kiss Misty upon the 
forehead with as much subtle passion as she could muster, &quot;and I 
hope to one day find all the right words to tell you how much I 
love you in return. But for now, just relax. I have so much to 
show you...&quot;

Misty smiled, sighing contentedly as she leaned her head forward 
to hide her sudden blush, giving Miranda ample opportunity to kiss 
the back of her neck, and run her hands up over the swell of 
Misty&#39;s hips, across her stomach, until finally reaching the 
gentle rise of her lover&#39;s breasts.

Although soft silk lay in a thin barrier between Miranda&#39;s hands 
and her lover&#39;s skin, the woman didn&#39;t mind. The gentle rustle of 
the fabric was just noticeable on the edge of her hearing, but the 
firm, but her tactile sense was very much in tune with the toned 
curves of Misty&#39;s body beneath her fingers. The way Misty caught 
her breath as her head leaned to one side adding yet another 
inviting aspect to the girl&#39;s allure as Miranda traced a line of 
slow kisses across her neck, up to her ear.

&quot;What good are my hands?&quot; whispered Miranda rhetorically in the 
tone she used for quiet recital as her fingers gently caressed 
Misty&#39;s breasts through the translucent fabric, &quot;If cannot hold 
you safe in my arms?&quot;

Misty shivered, clenching her fists unconsciously as Miranda ran 
the tip of her tongue with excruciating slowness along the curve 
of her lover&#39;s earlobe. &quot;And what use do my lips serve?&quot; she 
questioned, giving Misty&#39;s hardening nipples a gentle squeeze 
before running her hands up to her shoulders and back down her 
arms, &quot;If I can never know the joy of your kisses?&quot;

&quot;Then just hold, my dearest love,&quot; came Misty&#39;s whispered reply as 
Miranda&#39;s fingers slipped through her own, carefully lifting 
Misty&#39;s arms above her head, &quot;Let not the past besiege the walls 
of our passion, let no other come between us.&quot;

Miranda could feel Misty shiver as she reached past the girl&#39;s 
hands and took hold of two conveniently dangling lengths of silk. 
One was of a deep blue colour, the other simply of lavender. 

&quot;And taste my love upon your lips whenever you so desire,&quot; 
continued Misty, her soft, beautiful voice quavering slightly as 
Miranda loosely bound her wrists with the silken binds, &quot;Trace 
them across my skin, use them to provoke my desire, use them to 
taste the sweet ambrosia of my passion. Just always be my dearest 
Miri...&quot;

&quot;Always,&quot; promised Miranda, running her hands back down Misty&#39;s 
arms, which were now held out at comfortable angles, making her 
only seem helpless as Miranda&#39;s fingers pushed the sleeves of 
Misty&#39;s garment down her arms to her shoulders. 

Miranda then took a step back, smiling at her handiwork with a 
touch of amusement as she pulled a length of white silk from 
within her own flowing robes and held it at its ends. &quot;You can 
easily break free,&quot; the woman&#39;s voice echoed through Misty&#39;s mind 
as the length of white silk came from behind and covered her eyes, 
&quot;Those wonderful, soft hands of yours could easily slip free of 
these loose knots I&#39;ve bound your wrists with.&quot;

&quot;Why would I want to escape your love?&quot; replied Misty, her voice a 
sounding a little sad at the prospect before becoming a coy 
chuckle as she said, &quot;When I can finally know what it&#39;s like to 
have someone whose love comes without condition?&quot;

Miranda smiled as she tied the silken blindfold loosely behind her 
lover&#39;s head, covering Misty&#39;s eyes before playfully running her 
fingernails the girl&#39;s back as she followed them with kisses. 
Finally, though, as Miranda&#39;s fingers moved across the gentle rise 
of Misty&#39;s bottom, she knelt down behind her lover, and let her 
hands drop the rest of the way down.

&quot;Because of my past? Because of yours?&quot; answered Miranda, trying 
to keep her tone serious, but not succeeding as her fingers 
touched Misty&#39;s calves causing her to gasp, Misty&#39;s lithe body 
shivering at the touch, &quot;Because you have dreams to chase down? 
And I have a job to do?&quot;

Misty had to catch her breath as Miranda&#39;s hands pushed the fabric 
of her gown up as they slowly, appreciatively moved up her legs. 
&quot;Never,&quot; promised Misty, her fingers wrapping around the lengths 
of silk that so loosely bound her wrists and pulling at them to no 
avail, &quot;If I were to loose you, who would I have to hold me on the 
coldest nights? Who would I have to share the joy of my victories 
with? Who would I have to make love with...?&quot;

Miranda closed her eyes, sighing contentedly as she listened to 
her beloved&#39;s words. All the while her hands traveled higher, 
occasionally sliding back down over the wonderfully toned muscles 
of Misty&#39;s calves before moving higher, and soliciting a small 
gasping moan.

&quot;No one who would care for you as deeply as I,&quot; Miranda agreed, 
sliding her hands around the front of Misty&#39;s thighs, gently 
caressing the smooth skin as she maneuvered her head underneath 
the dangling robe, &quot;And besides. No one else who knows just how to 
touch you.&quot;

Misty&#39;s reply was stifled by the sudden chill that ran up her 
spine. Miranda&#39;s lips touched her inner thigh, kissing her 
playfully before moving across to the other. The woman then 
glanced up and smiled as she moved slowly upward towards Misty&#39;s 
womanhood.

&quot;I want you so much that nothing else has meaning,&quot; added Miranda, 
pausing to teasingly run the tip of her tongue a short distance up 
Misty&#39;s inner thigh, &quot;I feel as though I&#39;ve been poisoned by my 
desire for you, and the only cure is the taste of your sweet 
ambrosia.&quot;

Her lover inhaled sharply as Miranda&#39;s hands slid up her thighs, 
carrying the hem of the thin robe ever higher, until the courier&#39;s 
fingers slid appreciatively across the gentle rising curve of 
Misty&#39;s bottom. With little gasps of anticipation, followed small 
moans of longing, Misty staggered slightly, standing with her legs 
slightly apart as she felt the tip of Miranda&#39;s tongue touch her 
womanhood, tasting Misty&#39;s infinite desire. 

As Miranda&#39;s tongue ran slowly between Misty&#39;s labia, she push her 
bottom out invitingly, trying to position herself to Miranda both 
more room to maneuver, and a better view. In response, it was all 
that Miranda could do to not just slide her tongue deeper and 
simply suckle forth the moisture that formed in response to her 
touch. The sounds Misty was making, combined with her own desire 
causing Miranda&#39;s body to quiver as she slowly lapped at Misty&#39;s 
labia, patiently teasing her beloved to orgasm.

&quot;P-please,&quot; came Misty&#39;s breathless response as Miranda switched 
to using the flat of her tongue, still not penetrating, nor going 
near her lover&#39;s clit which was surely yearning to be touched, 
&quot;Don&#39;t tease me so.&quot;

&quot;Am I teasing you, my love?&quot; responded Miranda, unable to banish 
the smile from her lips as she leisurely drew her tongue back and 
gave Misty&#39;s firm bottom an appraising squeeze, &quot;I could always 
stop, and leave you alone if you&#39;d like.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare-!&quot; gasped out Misty, both laughing and shouting 
out her joy at the same time as Miranda&#39;s tongue finally slid 
inside her, and the courier&#39;s lips covering her labia.

Misty threw her head back, crying out in her elation. The soft, 
warm caress of Miranda&#39;s tongue upon her inner folds causing her 
whole body to convulse as she neared orgasm. She could feel the 
knowing touch of Miranda&#39;s hands, now moving slowly up her back, 
pushing gently against her muscles in just the right places to 
relieve the tension she herself was causing. Misty could hear the 
quiet, approving sounds Miranda made as the woman went about her 
work, relentlessly suckling against Misty&#39;s labia as her tongue 
moved about inside her.

Finally, as Misty felt as though she could take no more, she felt 
Miranda pull away and nearly cried as the cooler air touched her 
where once there had only been her lover&#39;s warmth.

&quot;Wha-?&quot; stammered Misty, only to hear Miranda&#39;s quiet chuckle, and 
a low rustling as the silken garment she wore came magically 
apart, falling from her shoulders and pooling at her feet in a 
pile of tattered silk as Miranda stood and walked around to the 
front.

&quot;We&#39;re not finished yet, my love,&quot; came the sound of the courier&#39;s 
voice, coupled with the quiet licking of her lips followed by 
Miranda&#39;s arms around Misty and a passionate kiss.

Miranda had slipped her own garment off, and slid her now bare 
arms around Misty&#39;s naked body before moving in close to kiss her. 
The girl&#39;s lips quivered as they touched, but were quite more than 
willing. Miranda shivered unconsciously as she hugged Misty 
tightly, tilting her head to one side and sliding her tongue past 
Misty&#39;s slightly parted lips.

Again Miranda was delighted to find her lover so willing to 
indulge her, yet she knew that the poor girl needed release. The 
brewing orgasm had been brought to an end all too soon, but 
Miranda&#39;s need to kiss her lover had been too great. &quot;I just love 
you so much,&quot; she whispered, pulling away from the equally 
breathless Misty, smiling at her lover&#39;s appearance. Though she 
was near helplessly bound, unable to see, there still the 
delightful self-confidence and complete trust in Miranda that made 
the woman fall in love with Misty all over again.

Miranda then had to smile as Misty leaned her head forward, 
playfully nipping at the air between them as though to capture 
Miranda&#39;s kisses. &quot;You, you can&#39;t leave me yet,&quot; replied Misty, an 
equally playful smile crossing her face even as her voice sounded 
pleading, &quot;I still need you...&quot;

&quot;And I shall always need you, my love&quot; assured Miranda, stepping 
back as she slid her hands around to the front where they came to 
rest just under the pleasant handfuls Misty&#39;s breasts, &quot;Just be 
patient for a moment longer.&quot;

Misty nodded slowly, quietly accepting one final kiss upon the 
lips before Miranda traced a line of them down her neck, every so 
often giving the her sensitive skin a gentle nibble. All the 
while, Miranda&#39;s hands moved upward, her fingers fanning out to 
cup the gentle rise of Misty&#39;s breasts before caressing them 
lovingly. 

&quot;I love you,&quot; Miranda whispered again, just loud enough for Misty 
to hear over the quiet music as she kissed her way back down to 
the same level as her hands.

Misty&#39;s only reply was a nod as she began breathing though her 
mouth, reaching out with one leg in a desperate attempt to touch 
Miranda in the way her hands longed to, as Miranda&#39;s hands slid 
across Misty&#39;s soft skin, around to her back as she pushed her 
bosom forward invitingly. And without a second thought, Miranda 
gladly accepted the offer. 

Before her Misty&#39;s breasts seemed to be longing for her touch, 
even as her caressing fingers played across the sensitive skin. 
And as Miranda moved her hands aside, she could see how Misty&#39;s 
hardened nipples seemed to ache to be suckled.

As her hands traced their way across her lover&#39;s skin and her 
fingers scratched lightly down Misty&#39;s back, Miranda&#39;s slow, 
patient tongue made careful circles around each of the girl&#39;s 
nipples in turn before she gave one breast a playful kiss, and 
slowly brought a portion of it into her mouth.

Misty reacted with a visible shiver as she bit her lip her head 
fell to one side as her mind swam so close to compete euphoria. As 
Miranda&#39;s tongue played across the captured portion of her breast, 
flicking her nipple playfully before cautious teeth gave it a 
gentle nibble, Misty released her grip on her binds, letting 
herself hang limply. She then sighed deeply, leaning into Miranda 
who gladly supported her weight, kissing her way to the other 
breast and repeating the process before slowly sliding downwards. 

&quot;And now to finish what I started,&quot; promised Miranda, crouching 
down and dragging her parted lips across Misty&#39;s stomach as her 
fingers pressed against the girl&#39;s back, tracing long lines down 
to her bottom once again.

&quot;Please don&#39;t tease me,&quot; replied Misty dreamily, smiling as 
Miranda&#39;s hands slid playfully across her bottom before behind 
Misty&#39;s legs and lifting them off the ground. 

Misty gasped, half expecting the silken cords to snap, but they 
gave no protest, even as her thighs were placed comfortably upon 
Miranda&#39;s shoulders, and the courier supported her weight without 
a problem.

&quot;I shall not, my love,&quot; Miranda assured, kissing one of Misty&#39;s 
inner thighs passionately, and causing her lover&#39;s fingers to curl 
unconsciously as her body reacted to what was to come, &quot;But I will 
take my time.&quot;

&quot;Please hurry,&quot; Misty panted, gritting her teeth against the 
sensation that was building up inside of her as she leaned back, 
smiling, as she pulled against the unbreakable silken binds and 
found that they didn&#39;t so much as tighten against her wrists. 

&quot;You cannot rush an artist,&quot; teased Miranda, her hands pushing 
against Misty&#39;s bottom so that her face was closer to her goal, 
&quot;And patience is half a virtue.&quot;

As she ran her tongue across Misty&#39;s inner thigh, bringing it 
tantalizingly close to her lover&#39;s womanhood, Misty&#39;s legs pushed 
against Miranda&#39;s ears, drowning out most of the outside world. 
All that Miranda&#39;s could hear as her tongue slid up the line 
between Misty&#39;s labia were the muffled sounds her beloved&#39;s gasps 
and little exclamations, coupled with the faint sound of her 
pulse. 

Trapped as she was, Miranda couldn&#39;t help smile inwardly at the 
irony her imagination had woven. Both lovers trapped by the other, 
both unwilling to do the one thing that would set them both free. 
But it was a comforting feeling, knowing that neither would 
willingly let the other go.

Finally, though, as she imagined licking Misty&#39;s clit in the 
quick, deliberate lapping motions she knew would push her lover 
over the brink, Miranda felt herself let go as well. &#39;This is how 
it should be,&#39; she thought wistfully just before the feeling hit 
her, banishing all coherent thought, &#39;both of us sharing this 
feeling together...&#39;

***

Violet paused before the closed bathroom door, a few towels and 
some of her old clothes bundled in her arms. &#39;I have such a 
strange family,&#39; she muttered, about to slide the door open with 
her foot when a sound caught her ear.

An amused grin traced its way across the woman&#39;s face as she 
leaned her ear against the thin wooden door. &quot;Ohh!&quot; Violet 
whispered to herself, listening to the occasional splashes of 
water, and the quiet sounds of Miranda&#39;s uneven breathing, &quot;Like, 
I totally thought so!&quot;

With a gleam of mischief in her eye, Misty&#39;s eldest sister set 
down her burden and slid the door open ever so slightly. Through 
the narrow opening, Violet could see Miranda a short distance 
away. She had slid down a ways into the warm water, and what was 
left of the bubbles conspired to obscure Violet&#39;s view, but by 
virtue of the movements and sounds courier made, Violet had no 
doubt in her mind as to what Miranda was up to.

&#39;So this is the sort of company my little sister&#39;s been keeping,&#39; 
thought Violet from the doorway mirthfully, licking her suddenly 
dry lips as the soft sounds filled her ears, &#39;This like so totally 
needs further investigation...&#39;

Miranda, unaware of her silent observer continued about her task. 
With a contented smile and a soft exclamation she brought her 
knees up as the feeling of ecstasy finally caressed her mind. 
&quot;Misty...&quot; she whispered quietly, leaning her head back and biting 
her lower lip to keep from crying out.

Beneath the soapy water, two of the courier&#39;s fingers gently 
traced teasing paths across her labia before coming together at 
her clit, playfully teasing it before Miranda&#39;s middle finger 
moved between them to rub softly against it. The woman&#39;s body 
tensed as she slid her finger back and forth with almost painful 
slowness, urging herself forward slowly and carefully.

&#39;I shouldn&#39;t make so much noise,&#39; she chided herself sternly, 
reaching up with her free hand and giving one breast a bit of a 
squeeze to alleviate the sudden peculiar ache it felt, &#39;I can&#39;t 
let them hear...&quot;

From the doorway, Violet stopped the unconscious clenching of her 
fingers as she leaned forward, one eye closed as she peered 
through the barely open door. &#39;I wonder,&#39; she thought wistfully, 
pushing her legs closer together in an attempt to alleviate the 
mild tingle she felt between them, &#39;Like if Misty knows just how 
much of a total perv this Miranda girl is!&#39;

Violet tried to add an extra touch of self-righteousness to her 
words, but hardly felt it. She could see many reasons why her 
sister had chosen the courier as her lover, even if Miranda was by 
Violet&#39;s standards a &#39;hick&#39;. Even now Violet could remember the 
thoughtful mystery of Miranda&#39;s gray eyes. The way they could look 
right into a person&#39;s soul, yet reveal nothing about the woman 
herself. They were almost the colour storm clouds, or at least 
that of the quiet haze that often surrounded the mysterious tower 
in her hometown of Lavender. 

That same place had more than likely given her the &#39;Lavender look&#39; 
people from the south often commented on. Though Miranda&#39;s skin 
was a touch pale, it still showed life. Almost in defiance against 
entropy itself, yet at the same time embracing the eerie twilight 
most citizens of Lavender spent their lives enduring. By the same 
token, Miranda&#39;s hair was the colour of murkrow&#39;s feathers, a deep 
blackness that reflected little light, and drew one&#39;s eyes to it 
like an inescapably beautiful void. And though it seemed to have a 
bit of a mind of its own, and needed to be kept mostly tied back 
save for the woman&#39;s stubborn bangs, Violet felt a tinge of envy. 

She knew it was more than likely that Miranda had never dyed it; 
she had never &#39;had&#39; to spend hours taking care of her bountiful 
locks. Miranda&#39;s life style and small town values made her the 
sort who simply let it be. Occasionally hacking off the last few 
inches of it to keep it at vaguely the same length. But what it 
was a beauty that Violet had tried to find in her own hair of 
deepest purple, yet had never quite achieved.

&#39;I must have her,&#39; the woman thought almost hungrily, kneeling so 
that she could bunch up the front hem of her long skirt and touch 
herself through the unnecessarily frilly undergarment she wore, 
and pushed the door open a little farther, &#39;Misty like totally 
doesn&#39;t deserve such a creature.&#39;

For several long minutes, Violet spied upon Miranda, teasing 
moisture to her fingertips before sliding her fingers under the 
waistband of her unnecessarily complicated undergarments and 
moving one slowly between the twin rises of her labia. &quot;It&#39;s so 
not fair,&quot; she whispered, dragging her middle finger back and 
forth until she could take it no longer, &quot;Like, little sisters 
should only get &#39;hand-me-downs&#39;!&quot; 

Violet stopped herself from crying out as her middle finger slid 
up insider herself while she leaned against the doorframe for 
support. For one agonizing moment, she thought Miranda had heard 
her, and Violet&#39;s mind quickly conjured up images of the younger 
woman quickly sliding open the door only to stare in shock as 
Violet half knelt before her with one hand under her long skirt.

Once the tense moment passed, however, and she realized that 
Miranda had merely stopped to unbind her hair, the image actually 
sent a small exited chill down Violet&#39;s spine. &quot;Yes,&quot; she hissed 
under her breath, closing her eyes tightly as she imagined Miranda 
flinging the door open and standing before her naked except for 
the water that glistened across her skin, and the stray suds that 
still clung to her body, &quot;Just like that...&quot;

Violet continued with the thought, imagining herself blushing 
deeply as Miranda&#39;s eyes reflected a stoic calm, yet her face held 
an expression of barely concealed embarrassed amusement. Without a 
word Miranda stared down at Violet with an almost demanding look 
as she glanced back up with a mixture of embarrassed desire.

Violet smiled to herself as she knelt down upon the floor, pulling 
her skirt up in the front and leaning forward slightly in an 
imagined attempt to retain false modesty yet still entice her 
sister&#39;s lover. The gym leader further imagined herself trying to 
speak, desperate to offer an explanation as her fingers ruthlessly 
continued their task, unhindered by her predicament. &quot;Please...&quot; 
Violet said to the conjured image before her, letting the woman 
formulate her own opinion as to what Violet needed. 

Through half closed eyes, she could almost see a small smile cross 
Miranda&#39;s face as she watched, a gleam of satisfaction finally 
showing in the courier&#39;s eyes. &quot;Continue,&quot; Violet imagined Miranda 
saying, her voice full of the focused confidence she remembered 
the woman having over two year ago when she&#39;d first arrived at the 
gym, &quot;Show me the opportunity I passed up the last time.&quot;

Violet could only nod obligingly, unbuttoning the front of her 
blouse as her wetted fingers slid back and over her clit. &quot;Oh-!&quot; 
she exclaimed helplessly, popping a button off the garment.

The image of Miranda chuckled, watching as the button skittered 
across the floor behind her. &quot;No matter,&quot; the woman said in the 
maternal tone she reserved for her pokemon, &quot;There are greater 
needs to be attended to, my dear.&quot;

Violet let out a small exclamation as the courier stepped closer 
and brushed her deep purple hair from her eyes. &quot;An- Anything,&quot; 
stammered Violet, staring up at Miranda with a sudden hungry 
desire that contrasted her fantasy lover&#39;s suddenly loving caress, 
&quot;Anything you want...&quot;

Violet then stood up upon her shaking knees, raising her head 
above Miranda&#39;s waist level and kissing her stomach just above the 
navel. For a moment, the thought sent another envious chill 
thought Violet&#39;s mind. Miranda more than likely had never been on 
any kind of forced diet. Even with her rigorous swimming routine&#39;s 
Violet still had to overcome the temptations brought on by 
Cerulean&#39;s finer restaurants, the sweet smells of sugary snacks 
from the frequent Summer carnivals and the ravenous hunger she 
felt after hours of swimming. Yet here was a woman who&#39;s life 
style meant constant exercise, and often only healthy food was 
available in the seemingly endless expanses between human cities. 

But Violet pushed the thought from her mind; she was determined to 
enjoy the gift that chance had brought her. She imagined drawing 
back her hand and reaching towards Miranda with a mischievous 
smile. 

Her image of Miranda gave Violet a questioning look, but Violet 
merely shook her head slowly, carefully watching Miranda&#39;s 
expression as she slid her wetted fingers across Miranda&#39;s 
womanhood, pushing gently and rubbing until Miranda&#39;s body 
quivered and she found it hard to stand.

&quot;There we go,&quot; chuckled Violet, bringing her hand back and running 
one finger across her tongue provocatively, &quot;Hm, we taste good 
together. It like, must be totally meant to be or something!&quot;

Violet couldn&#39;t help but smile as she dropped down a bit and moved 
towards Miranda&#39;s womanhood, licking her lips in anticipation as 
she felt fingers slide through her hair and guide her forward. 
&quot;You are like, so mine...&quot; Violet whispered, opening her mouth 
slightly and reaching out with her tongue, exercising every ounce 
of patience she could muster before-

From the bathroom Violet heard a rather loud gasp, followed by an 
embarrassed exclamation and a splash of water. &quot;Crud!&quot; she cursed 
under her breath, opening her eyes and gritting her teeth in 
annoyance, &quot;So close...&quot;

The Gym Leader shook her head, sighing as she gathered up the pile 
of towels and stood up. From the bathroom she could hear Miranda&#39;s 
movements. It was easy to tell she was embarrassed by her sudden 
out burst, but Violet ignored the temptation to simply walk in 
unannounced, even if her fantasy had been cut short.

&#39;Oh well,&#39; she thought, straightening out her clothes and suckling 
the moisture from her fingers as an after thought, &#39;It can&#39;t be 
half as good as the real thing.&#39;

Miranda turned her head to the sound of a nock at the door. &quot;Come 
in,&quot; she called a touch nervously as she fumbled around for her 
glasses, &quot;I&#39;m almost done in her anyway.&quot;

Violet smiled almost knowingly as she stepped quietly into the 
room, causing Miranda to look away and grab the bottle of shampoo 
she&#39;d found. &quot;I was just about to wash my hair, actually,&quot; she 
lied, quickly finding her wits as she pushed back the 
embarrassment.

&quot;Oh, like you&#39;re not using that brand are you?&quot; inquired Violet 
with a disapproving look as she put the towels down on the counter 
and looked around for another bottle, &quot;Cause it totally doesn&#39;t 
suit you!&quot;

&quot;Doesn&#39;t suit me?&quot; inquired Miranda, skeptically reading the 
label.

Violet nodded as she walked towards the tub, a different bottle in 
on hand, and two folded towels in the other. &quot;Here,&quot; she offered 
with some concern, &quot;give your hair a quick rinse and sit on the 
edge of the tub so I can wash it for you.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; replied Miranda, thankful that her hostess either hadn&#39;t 
caught her or at least was polite enough not to mention it, &quot;Just 
be careful, I think there may still be a bramble or two caught in 
it.&quot;

Violet cringed at the thought of getting anything in her hair as 
Miranda took off her glasses and leaned forward, dunking her head 
and hair under for a moment.

&quot;That&#39;s better,&quot; commented Violet, setting the folded towel near 
the edge of the tub and watching surreptitiously as Miranda stood 
with her back to the older woman and sat down upon it. 

&quot;This is rather nice of you, considering,&quot; said Miranda 
conversationally, not bothering to put her glasses back on as 
Violet knelt behind her on another towel.

&quot;It&#39;s like, totally not a big deal,&quot; the Gym Leader assured, 
adjusting her skirt so she wouldn&#39;t get them it before squirting a 
blob of oddly coloured liquid into her hand, &quot;But like I just had 
to get away from the others for a couple of minutes.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; inquired Miranda a little suspiciously as she felt the 
woman&#39;s fingers attempt to bunch up her dripping hair.

&quot;Oh, like you know,&quot; explained Violet, finding the task of 
arranging Miranda&#39;s hair properly more difficult than she&#39;d 
anticipated and needing more shampoo, &quot;I can only take so much 
family reunion stuff at a time. And like my sister&#39;s so over 
reacting about seeing her pokemon again, it&#39;s just like, so 
totally weird!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; replied Miranda a little defensively, &quot;If I 
hadn&#39;t seen one of mine in three years I know I&#39;d overreact too. 
Heck, I&#39;d probably have a pile of poetry written about how much I 
missed him or her. Besides, the way she&#39;s so free and uninhibited 
with her emotions is one of the reasons I love Misty.&quot;

&quot;You write?&quot; inquired Violet, half surprised as she finally 
managed to get most of the courier&#39;s hair into one place before 
emptying the nearly half the bottle to lather it properly.

&quot;Yeah, since I was little,&quot; the woman admitted, self-consciously 
folding her arms across her chest and crossing her legs as Violet 
worked into a rhythm, &quot;I guess it just wasn&#39;t important last time 
I was here so I just never mentioned it what with everything else 
that was going on.&quot;

&quot;Well, like actually,&quot; commented Violet, leaning forward a little 
and lowering her voice as her fingers traced paths across 
Miranda&#39;s scalp, &quot;That&#39;s quite the coincidence.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Do tell?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; replied Violet, a satisfied smile crossing her lips as she 
found an excuse to lean closer to Miranda&#39;s ear and speaking in a 
hushed tone, &quot;There&#39;s a contest being sponsored by that new 
restaurant that&#39;s opening... &#39;Ces Batards De L&#39;autre Cote De La 
Rue&#39; I think it&#39;s called.&quot;

Miranda nodded thoughtfully. &quot;Indeed,&quot; the courier explained, 
&quot;It&#39;s the one I dropped a delivery off to last night. Is it at the 
restaurant or at the fair grounds?&quot;

&quot;The grounds,&quot; replied Violet, leaning back and smiling in 
satisfaction as she made slow, purposeful motions, dragging her 
nails as she worked in an attempt to send chills down Miranda&#39;s 
spine, &quot;The grand prize is dinner for two at the restaurant.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s an irony there,&quot; Miranda chuckled, &quot;Looks like Misty&#39;ll 
get that ice-cream she wanted after all.&quot;

&quot;Say wha-?&quot; stammered Violet, giving Miranda quizzical look as the 
commented caught her off balance.

&quot;Nothing,&quot; the woman chuckled, shaking her head slightly and 
trying not to blush, &quot;don&#39;t worry about it. So, when is it? Where 
do I sign up?&quot;

Violet shrugged, suddenly cursing herself for not paying more 
attention when she&#39;d head about the contest. &quot;Like, I&#39;m not sure, 
eh,&quot; she explained carefully, &quot;But I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll say in the 
paper. And like, there&#39;s likely to be fliers at the fairgrounds 
that&#39;ll tell you everything anyway.&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; said Miranda thoughtfully, &quot;I&#39;ll be sure to check it out. 
But in the mean time, I guess I&#39;ll have to find a source of 
inspiration.&quot;

A grin crossed Violet&#39;s lips as she suppressed the comment that 
immediately came to mind. &quot;You know,&quot; she said, changing the 
subject as she unraveled the length of Miranda&#39;s now thoroughly 
soapy hair, &quot;this is like, really quite amazing!&quot;

&quot;What is?&quot; asked Miranda, feeling a bit distracted and easily 
ignoring the sensation of Violet&#39;s fingers as they tried 
unsuccessfully to untie a few loose knots.

&quot;You&#39;re hair, it&#39;s like totally to die for!&quot; the woman laughed in 
reply, holding it out to its full length with both hands.

&quot;Thanks mom,&quot; Miranda chuckled, not taking the comment completely 
seriously.

&quot;No, like I totally mean it,&quot; assured Violet letting Miranda&#39;s 
hair fall wetly against her back, &quot;It&#39;s so long and vibrant. It&#39;s 
like totally the opposite of Misty&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong with your sister&#39;s hair,&quot; replied Miranda 
coldly, jumping immediately to her lover&#39;s defense.

&quot;But its like, totally short!&quot; explained Violet, taking the length 
of Miranda&#39;s hair and forming it into a pony tail, &quot;And the way 
she wears it! Yeesh! Like when was that in style?&quot;

&quot;Being in style isn&#39;t important to myself or Misty,&quot; continued 
Miranda, her eyes narrowing in annoyance, refusing to be baited 
so, &quot;Besides, short hair suits her. Misty has a natural beauty 
that shines from within, and her personal sense of style some how 
extenuates that.&quot; 

&quot;So,&quot; inquired Violet mischievously as she tossed Miranda&#39;s hair 
over one shoulder and brought her lips close to the woman&#39;s neck, 
&quot;You like &#39;tomboys&#39; then?&quot;

&quot;When it suits me,&quot; Miranda replied coldly with a shrug, 
regretting that she hadn&#39;t invited Misty to join her, and hating 
the feeling of Violet&#39;s hot breath upon her bare shoulder.

&quot;So what you&#39;re saying then is,&quot; Violet continued with a 
mischievous giggle as her fingers ran through the length of the 
courier&#39;s soapy hair, &quot;Is that you&#39;ve had better?&quot;

&quot;I think that your sister&#39;s beauty stands in testament to that.&quot; 

Violet clenched her fingers slightly, but managed to keep her 
voice level. &quot;Then perhaps someone should show you the other 
possibilities that life has to offer,&quot; she said in a quiet, sultry 
tone as she leaned forward in one final attempt at more blatant 
seduction.

Miranda felt an unpleasantly cold shiver run down her spine as 
Violet&#39;s lips touched her neck. An unpleasant mixture of guilt and 
revulsion fought hard against the small glimmer of pleasure she 
gained from the gesture before pushing it back down and muting it 
out.

&quot;My love is taken,&quot; said Miranda coldly, carefully reaching back, 
&quot;It belongs to Misty.&quot;

&quot;But like, what about your lust?&quot; inquired Violet in a smug, 
sultry tone, only then noticing the way Miranda had suddenly 
grabbed a handful of her hair before yanking it forward.

Not wanting to risk having such a generous handful of her precious 
commodity torn out, Violet leaned forward into the pull on 
instinct. Without hesitation, Miranda followed through with the 
movement, refusing to take pleasure in the fact that Misty&#39;s 
sister was willing to somersault willingly into the tub fully 
clothed rather than risk having a few hairs yanked out.   

The enormous splash of water was accompanied by a loud shriek, and 
Miranda had to shield her eyes from the spray as she pulled her 
legs out of the water. &quot;My lust has not meaning in the face of my 
loyalty,&quot; the courier hissed quietly as the sound of footsteps was 
heard out in the hall and a thoroughly soaked Violet came up for 
air gasping with embarrassment and anger.

&quot;What happened?!&quot; exclaimed Misty as she burst into the room, once 
more with Umi draped about her shoulders.

&quot;Your sister had a little accident,&quot; said Miranda simply, glancing 
sideways as Violet as she stood up and gave her soaked through 
clothes a look of complete embarrassment.

&quot;You okay?&quot; inquired Lily as she entered the room just behind her 
sister.

&quot;I- I&#39;m fine,&quot; Violet replied coolly, glancing at Miranda with 
uncertainty.

&quot;You should really be more careful,&quot; chided Lily as she grabbed 
one of the unused towels and held it open for her sibling.

&quot;But I feel like a drown rattata,&quot; Violet pouted, not glancing 
back at Miranda as she stepped out of the tub and into the warmth 
of the towel.

&quot;I&#39;d watch what you say about rattata&#39;s,&quot; chuckled Misty as the 
dratini she held glared at the woman, her eyes swirling a 
dangerous combination of red and orange as she made a quiet 
hissing sound through her sharp, thin teeth.

&quot;It&#39;s just an expression,&quot; assured Miranda reaching out to pet Umi 
as Misty came closer, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, little one, you needn&#39;t defend 
Nezumi&#39;s honor today.&quot;

Misty laughed as the dratini slid from her shoulders and wrapped 
herself protectively around Miranda&#39;s arm before nuzzling against 
her affectionately. &quot;Should I be jealous?&quot; the girl inquired 
glancing over her shoulder as her siblings filed out of the room 
to find Violet some dry clothes.

&quot;Of Umi or Violet?&quot; asked Miranda, trying to keep her tone light 
as she gave the little dragon&#39;s eye ridges an affectionate 
scratch.

&quot;Um, both?&quot; offered Misty, turning back with an amused expression, 
yet her eyes mirrored concern.

&quot;Never,&quot; replied Miranda sincerely as she swung her feet down onto 
the bottom step before pushing herself up and stepping down onto 
the floor, &quot;You know me better than that.&quot;

Misty nodded, the smile slipping from her face as her eyes teared 
up. &quot;I know,&quot; she said quietly, gladly accepting the embrace that 
Miranda immediately offered, &quot;But you don&#39;t know what these people 
are like. My sisters, it&#39;s like I&#39;m a play thing to them...&quot;

&quot;Shh, I know, dearest,&quot; Miranda whispered into her ear as Umi 
slithered into the still warm water of the tub and stared back at 
the human&#39;s with eyes that glowed greenish with sympathy, &quot;but 
there&#39;s no reason to worry. You&#39;re the only Cerulean sister that I 
want. The only one who&#39;s sensational in my eyes.&quot;

Misty took a deep breath, inhaling the combination of Miranda&#39;s 
scent and the vanilla-ish flavor of the shampoo in her hair. &quot;Just 
tell me you love me,&quot; she pleaded, looking up at Miranda with an 
expression that made the courier&#39;s heart break just to look upon 
her.

&quot;With all my heart,&quot; said Miranda her tone serious as she met and 
held her lover&#39;s gaze, &quot;I love you Misty. And nothing, not the 
span of year, not even if there&#39;s a hundred thousand miles between 
us, and certainly not one of your sisters is going to change that. 
I love you so much that sometimes I feel as though I could 
burst... Is there nothing that I can do to assure you of this 
fact?&quot;

Misty lifted her arms and returned the embrace, not caring that 
she was getting soaking wet as she hugged Miranda back. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry,&quot; she whispered, noticing the tears in her beloved&#39;s eyes, 
&quot;I... I shouldn&#39;t be so insecure. It&#39;s not like me.&quot;

&quot;And tears aren&#39;t like me,&quot; replied Miranda, a smile coming to her 
lips as she saw that Misty wasn&#39;t completely distraught, &quot;But, can 
you forgive me? Even if it&#39;s just for worrying you?&quot;

Misty looked thoughtful for a moment, glancing at her sibling&#39;s 
wet footprints across the tiled floor. &quot;Only if you tell me the 
truth about what happened here,&quot; she said simply, glancing back at 
Miranda with a serious look that made Miranda&#39;s stomach clench 
almost painfully.

&quot;Even if I must run the risk of hurting you, my love?&quot; inquired 
Miranda, a feeling of deep uncertainty creeping up on her. 

Misty nodded slowly. &quot;I can handle it, Miranda,&quot; she assured, 
resting her head against her beloved&#39;s naked shoulder, &quot;I&#39;m 
stronger that I look.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; replied Miranda, a hint of amusemnt entering her voice, 
&quot;It&#39;s one of the things that I love about you. But, if it will 
make you feel better, your sister... Violet, she tried to seduce 
me.&quot;

Misty tensed, and Miranda felt a deep sense of dread overcome her. 
&#39;Here I am,&#39; she thought mirthlessly, &#39;Standing naked, wet, and 
vulnerable in a stranger&#39;s house. And now I&#39;m about to loose one 
of things that makes life worth living...&#39;

&quot;Go on,&quot; said Misty after a moment, her voice seeming a little 
distant, yet still lacking malice. To Miranda, though, it sounded 
akin to the voice judgment.

&quot;Violet... She kissed my neck,&quot; the woman explained, tears falling 
from her eyes as she spoke, &quot;She just thought it was all a game. 
Like somehow my love for you is just a game I&#39;m playing... So I 
just reacted without thinking... I- I tossed her head first into 
tub.&quot;

Miranda felt a horrible tension overwhelm her as she finished her 
story, and a dread uncertainty as Misty looked up at her 
questioning. &quot;You threw her into the tub?&quot; she inquired, a small 
smile budding upon her lips.

Miranda nodded, a glimmer of hope finding a place in her despair. 

&quot;That&#39;s... That&#39;s...&quot; stammered Misty, starting to laugh, &quot;That&#39;s 
hysterical!&quot;

&quot;Then you&#39;re not mad?&quot; inquired Miranda, as Misty squeezed her 
tightly laughing.

&quot;What?! No! Of course not!&quot; assured Misty, leaning back with her 
arms around Miranda&#39;s torso, &quot;I trust you, Miranda. And I love 
you.&quot;

Before the courier could reply, Misty kissed her. With the 
gesture, Miranda felt her worry drain away, replaced by a sudden 
mirth as she put her arms around Misty once more. &#39;Thank you, 
Violet,&#39; she thought in amusement, &#39;You&#39;ve given me my 
inspiration...!&#39;</pre>
