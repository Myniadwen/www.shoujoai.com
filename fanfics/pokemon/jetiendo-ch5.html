<h1>Jetiendo (part 5 of 38)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/jetiendo-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&quot; Ok&quot; Mr Grinal announced, &quot;You all go be back at sunset at the bus stop 
slabs guys&quot; 

Fear. Fear is what she usually felt it from the strength of her 
feelings, her love for the one person who was meant to be with someone 
else. Was he even close to realizing the truth? But then again, Ash 
Ketchum wasn&#39;t always the brightest crayon in the box when it came to 
the girls department. He would soon be turning 14, and yet he was still 
as dumb as a nail when dealing with love. If he even knew what it was. 

Sure, he loves his Pokemon. He loves battling; he loves his friends and 
family. But has he ever felt that kind of love? The kind of love that 
you only share with one person, only, The kind of love that May has been 
feeling for him the past 6 months? As she trudged along behind the 
others, May felt her face grow warm and her throat tighten as tears 
shined in her once happy indigo eyes.

Stop it May,&#39; she scolded herself inwardly. Do you really want the 
others to see you like this and pester for an explanation?&#39; &quot;...No...&quot; 
she whispered to herself. She roughly scrubbed away her tears with the 
back of her hand. Keep your chin up. Even if you have to force yourself 
to put on a cheesy happy-go-lucky fa&#135;ade, don&#39;t let them see you cry.&#39; 
On command, May straightened herself and continued to walk on, even if 
she felt like crumbling to the floor and never getting back up. 

&quot;Hey, May! You alright back there?&quot; May looked up to see the 
raven-haired boy who had stolen her heart, standing proudly on a small 
hill that meant they reached the entrance to Forset City. The gold, 
orange, and pink sunset light shone brilliantly behind his slightly 
muscled, teenage build. The colours of the sky danced on his lightly 
tanned skin, his lop-sided grin displayed on his handsome face. &quot;Pika 
pi?&quot; Pikachu tilted her head at May&#39;s trance like gaze towards Ash. 
&quot;Pika, pikachu...&quot; May hadn&#39;t realized she was just staring at him, then 
heard the annoying voice of her little brother. &quot;Um, Earth to May!&quot; Max 
shouted, clearly amused. May snapped out of it, and glared daggers into 
Max. He sweat-dropped and hid behind the eldest of the group, Brock. 

&quot;Looks like we reached Forset City,&quot; Brock stated. &quot;Finally!&quot; May said, 
forcing on the best smile she could. &quot;Well, lets get going!&quot; Ash called 
back. &quot;Um... I&#39;m a little tired... do you think we could take a break?&quot; 
May said quietly. &quot;But we&#39;re right at the entrance!&quot; Max boomed. &quot;I 
guess you&#39;re right... I can wait until we get to the Pokemon Center. It 
beats sleeping out here anyways.&quot; May replied. Ash blinked, and stared 
directly at May with his auburn eyes, as if the other two weren&#39;t there. 
May&#39;s face heated up, her heart pounding so hard she thought it would 
burst through her chest. Why is he looking at me like that?&#39;

the dorky smile appeared again. &quot;If you want to rest now, May, that&#39;s 
fine. We&#39;ll take a break for about an hour, reach Forset, and then look 
for the local Pokemon Center to stay overnight.&quot; May wanted to fall over 
at first, but then found herself speechless. Usually Ash is desperate to 
keep moving along...&#39; Brock had a look&#39; on his face while Max&#39;s eyes 
were as wide as saucers. They&#39;re just as stunned as me!&#39; May thought. 
Max opened his mouth to say something, but Brock held up his hand, and 
Max didn&#39;t say a word. 

It only took a while to find an open area, and we didn&#39;t exactly set up 
camp, but Brock decided to cook dinner... unless they wanted to arrive 
hungry in Forset. As Brock was preparing the meal, May felt the need to 
be away from them. No one was talking, and yet her head pulsed as if she 
was hearing loud music, just by being near Ash. She couldn&#39;t stand it. 
&quot;Hey, I&#39;m gonna go for a walk, okay?&quot; May said as she stood up. Max eyed 
her suspiciously, slowly beginning to catch on to what had been 
bothering May for some time now. &quot;Do you want anyone in particular to go 
with you?&quot; May&#39;s face flamed a shade of scarlet. 

&quot;Oh, no. I-I just want to be alone for a while,&quot; she answered quickly. 
Without another word, she set off.

As May pushed away branches and slid through the small-spaced trees, her 
mind wandered. She knew the mind was the one thing that could cause the 
most self-inflicted damage to her emotions, but at this point, she 
didn&#39;t care. Dream on, May. He doesn&#39;t and would never be able to love 
you. Ash is reserved for somebody else...&#39; &quot;Misty Waterflower,&quot; she 
mumbled, &quot;the Cerulean City Gym Leader.&quot; She had met Misty once, about 9 
months ago she s not on this trip now this trip that Davis, Ash&#39;s Cousin 
sneaked us in but that&#39;s how it feels like. When she was in her 
mid-journey with Ash... and right away she could see the connection. The 
bond. May didn&#39;t think much of it at first. In fact, it hadn&#39;t bothered 
her at all. She had actually really liked Misty. But it wasn&#39;t until she 
realized the intensity of her feelings for Ash that she began to feel 
panicked. 

She was no match for Misty whatsoever. It was like comparing a yellow 
daisy to a red rose. Misty wasn&#39;t the most perfect girl in the world, 
but she was a hell of a better young woman than May could hold a candle 
to. May reached a stray waterhole, with just one of the many beautiful 
sunrays that made Forset not only the highlight of Jetiendo, but also a 
popular vacationing city. May just stared for awhile at the beauty and 
blissful serene of the waterfall... then unleashed all the frustration 
and sadness that had been eating her up for half a year in this secluded 
serenity. 

She screamed. She threw rocks that were a full size bigger than her. She 
pulled and tugged at her hair. She stomped. She kicked her shoes off and 
tossed them ever which way. She tore off her gloves and hammered them to 
the ground, along with her bandanna. She cried. That&#39;s right... let it 
all out. They can&#39;t hear you&#39;re please, so it&#39;s okay. Just as long as 
they don&#39;t hear you.&#39; She wasn&#39;t doing this out of self-pity. She wasn&#39;t 
doing this because she couldn&#39;t have the one person she longed for the 
most. She was doing this because there was nothing else she could do to 
unleash the anguish she had held in for as long as she could remember. 
This was the first time she had felt this way for someone, and she could 
do nothing about it. Nothing. 

When May finished letting out her anger, the sadness had stayed and felt 
even heavier than before. She was a mess, inside and out. Her tears that 
refused to hold back didn&#39;t make her state any better. How did I get 
like this... this wreck?&#39; She thought bitterly. How did I end up falling 
in love with a boy I&#39;ve only known for a little over a year, and who&#39;s 
soul mates with someone else? At least... that&#39;s what I&#39;m told. When Ash 
isn&#39;t around, Brock almost always talks about their past adventures, 
his, Ash, and Misty&#39;s.&#39; She grimaced. That&#39;s only because Max asks about 
it all the time yet... Brock talks mostly about Ash and Misty. How they 
denied their feelings for each other, but were clearly affectionate 
together. After a while... I had to make up an excuse to leave the room 
when he brought it up... because I didn&#39;t want to hear it.&#39; May sighed, 
a fresh batch of tears springing to her eyes. Let it go, May. Just let 
it all &quot;go&quot;... fight it! Don&#39;t suffer like this anymore...&#39;

&quot;I-I can&#39;t!&quot; May began to sob quietly and rested her head on her folded 
knees. I hate you, Ash. I hate you. I hate you so much...&#39; May stopped 
sobbing for a minute, realizing what she had just thought. Great. Now 
you&#39;re acting like a 6 year old. For the love of... ugh, get over 
yourself May!&#39; She wearily stood up, the life nearly sucked out of her 
from her sudden outburst of crying. She had to lean against a tree to 
keep her balanced. May turned her eyes up, roaming the calm waters. She 
had an idea. It was ridiculous, but she felt she could be more relaxed 
if she went along with it.

May hesitated, but finally convinced herself to strip off her clothing. 
She unzipped her sport sweater, then so on, until a pile of clothes lay 
next to her. She shivered, the slight breeze brushing against her now 
bare skin. Her face flushed, she slowly stepped toward the edge of the 
warm sand, and waded her way into the chilled water. May squeezed her 
eyes shut, stopping until she was waist high in the water. She was still 
tense, her arms wrapped around herself, but she finally opened her eyes. 
&quot;Okay... I&#39;m okay... just get used to the feeling of the water, and swim 
around...&quot; May told herself aloud. May looked up to the now starry night 
sky, and traces of a small smile appeared on her lips. &quot;Beautiful...&quot; 
she breathed. 

Ash was now 13 feet away from May&#39;s secluded area, unaware of what would 
happen in the next few moments. As Ash squeezed through the tight spaces 
of the trees, not too far off, he heard the sound of rushing water. 
Knowing a source of water meant a clear area, he headed towards the 
sound. He was no more than 2 inches out of the bushes, until he came to 
a halt. There, standing waist high, naked in the water, was May.

&quot;Oh... shit...&quot; Ash rasped. He shut his eyes and turned his head away. 
You fucking pervert, don&#39;t just stand there! Haul ass until you&#39;re about 
20 feet away from her, and call out her name! Make it seem like you were 
never here!&#39; &quot;O-Okay.&quot; Ash began to back up slowly, his eyes still shut. 
Criminy, she barely turned 13 two weeks ago! What were you thinking?&#39; In 
the midst of his guilty conversation with himself, he had to feel around 
to backtrack himself... and kept his eyes closed so he wouldn&#39;t ogle 
May. He didn&#39;t pay attention to the wet and slippery rock behind him, 
and stepped on it, sending him crashing to the floor with a loud grunt. 

May gasped and whirled around. &quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; she called out, half brave 
and half scared to death. She glanced at her pile of clothes. Oh Lord... 
you didn&#39;t bring not one of your Pokemon? You&#39;re out in the wild, you 
idiot!&#39; May cursed under her breath. Then, without thinking of the 
consequences, she jumped out of the water and sprinted toward her 
clothes. She was about to slip on her undergarments when she heard a 
familiar voice. The voice that made her heart quickens. &quot;Uuuhhhnn... 
oww... uh... May? I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to scare you...&quot; Ash said 
groggily as he staggered up. &quot;. Ash?&quot; May replied to her...unexpected 
guest. 

May&#39;s face was redder than an apple. &quot;Uh, hey! T-turn around, I&#39;m not 
dressed!&quot; she stuttered. Ash whirled to the other direction to face the 
tree. Although she was trembling, May hastily dressed herself. &quot;You can 
come out now,&quot; she said. Ash shyly stepped out, now fully recovered, his 
head down so his hat shadowed his face. Even if he stood with his head 
held high, May knew she couldn&#39;t have been able to look into his eyes. 
&quot;We were all getting worried about you, so each of us split up to find 
you.&quot; Ash stated. &quot;Well... you found me.&quot; May replied. &quot;So, we should 
start heading back now.&quot; 

Ash turned towards the path to start walking back to camp. May didn&#39;t 
know what to think. She didn&#39;t know what was running through her head 
right now. She didn&#39;t know what caused the sudden action to pop into her 
head. She didn&#39;t know if she&#39;d regret what she was about to do, what she 
dared to believe in. But one way or another, it had to be said. She had 
to tell Ash how she truly felt for him. She inhaled, and then exhaled. 
&quot;Ash,&quot; she said, almost choking on his name. &quot;There&#39;s something I need 
to... no. I want to tell you something.&quot;

Ash stopped in his tracks. He faced May. &quot;Yeah, what is it? Is it bad?&quot; 
She gazed into his auburn eyes. &quot;Well... you can&#39;t just assume it&#39;s 
bad... you don&#39;t know that... I mean, it&#39;s not really bad, but...um...&quot; 
May was stumbling over her words. Horribly. &quot;May... you okay? What&#39;re 
you getting at?&quot; Ash asked, confused at her strange behaviour. &quot;I-I... 
Well, I...&quot; She couldn&#39;t say. She was putting off their return to camp 
to tell him the truth, and she couldn&#39;t say what her heart could scream. 
&quot;May.&quot; Ash had a concerned look on his face. &quot;What is it? We can&#39;t take 
too long, the others will worry about us if we don&#39;t...&quot; &quot;I love you!&quot; 
May interrupted.

Ash was silent, staring into her sparkling sapphire eyes, almost trying 
to see if he could find some kind of a hint that would let him know she 
was joking. But all he saw was honest virtue in those beautiful eyes, 
and it made him ache. &quot;I love you,&quot; May had repeated. &quot;I do, I really 
do!&quot; &quot;Ah- what... how did...&quot; Now Ash stumbled on his words. &quot;I can&#39;t 
explain it correctly,&quot; she began, &quot;but I can tell you this: I know. I 
know that you are faithful to Misty; I mean you guys are soul mates. And 
I&#39;m not trying to ruin that. I&#39;m not! But... not only are you the person 
I love with all my heart, you are also my friend. And since you&#39;re my 
friend, I should be honest with you on things you have a right to 
know... like my feelings. You can dislike me after this; you can even 
refuse to talk to me. But I love you, and confessing this to you is not 
something I&#39;ll regret!&quot; she finished boldly. Ash was speechless. 

The following events happened so fast, far too fast for both of them. 
May&#39;s arms shot out, closing the distance between her and Ash, and held 
on tight to the front of his sleeveless sweater. She brought his head 
down to hers in one quick motion, and claimed his lips to her own. Ash 
didn&#39;t push her away, but he didn&#39;t kiss back. He was dizzy. So 
dizzy...&#39; Her lips felt like flower petals against his. These sensations 
made him want to kiss her back so badly... but he was paralysed. 

She stopped the kiss, and felt like she had been slapped across the face 
when he didn&#39;t kiss back. &quot;... A-Ash...&quot; But May didn&#39;t finish her 
sentence. Ash swept her torso into his arms and kissed her, leaving her 
mind senseless. She wrapped her arms around him and kissed back. She 
felt him begin to nibble her lower lip, and she gladly let him enter her 
mouth with his tongue. He pulled away from her lips, his arms still 
holding her lovely frame against his. They were breathless, and Ash 
said, &quot;I. love you. People always say Misty and I should be together, 
but you know...&quot; he lifted her chin up to face him. &quot;I never really 
believed in soul mates. I believe two people meet and can fall in 
love... and that&#39;s what happened with you.&quot; Now May was speechless as 
tears welled up in her eyes. &quot;Ash...&quot; he put a finger to her lips. &quot;It 
doesn&#39;t matter what other people say. I know who I want to be with, I 
know who I&#39;d be truly happy with, and I&#39;m grateful she wants to be with 
me, too. Misty&#39;s a dear friend, but she&#39;s not you. I want to be with 
you, May.&quot; May let out a cry and eagerly kissed him again 

Meanwhile Gary was walking with Tasha. Gary spotted May and Ash kissing. 

&quot;Yes&quot; Gary thought, &quot; a grand is mine&quot;. It was just an idiotic bet and 
Tasha knew all about it. 

&quot; Tasha&quot; Gary frowned &quot; have you read the newspapers lately?&quot; 

&quot; Yeah&quot; Tasha replied, &quot; They call you Aladdin&quot; 

&quot; Yeah&quot; Gary lied &quot; well I need to ask you? What would happen about us&quot;? 

&quot; I don&#39;t know&quot; Tasha replied &quot; but I love you&quot; 

&quot; I love you too,&quot; Gary poured right out from his soul. Then the moment 
arrived a kiss from them to lift to the lord 

&quot; It&#39;s a tough world&quot; Tasha &quot; we&#39;ll get though it weather we&#39;re together 
or not&quot; 

&quot; Amen&quot; whispered Gary
