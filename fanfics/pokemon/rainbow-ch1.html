<h1>Rainbow Reminiscence (part 1 of 18)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nikolai.html">Nikolai Mirovich</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Note: Okay, firstly my apologies for this story taking so long 
to come out. I could give a plethora of excuses for why it did, but I 
won&#39;t bore you. Also, I&#39;m not totally happy with this story, so if you 
don&#39;t like it, I don&#39;t blame you. All I can do is try and do better next 
time. Oh, and I just wanted to thank my stepfather for helping me to 
name Erika&#39;s pokemon.

Present Tense...

The large cold, wet snowflakes of late January had been descending upon 
Celadon City for nearly three days straight before two travelers 
arrived. The wind had picked up an hour previously, blowing the snow 
into drifts as it came down at nearly a forty-five degree angle, forcing 
what few people dared to venture out into it to have to fight their way 
down what few streets remained mainly clear.

As the two made their way down the main street, past the rows of large 
homes with their ornate, sprawling gardens hibernating beneath the 
omnipresent snow, the sound of the traveler&#39;s wide wooden snowshoes 
crunching as they stepped was deadened by the howling of the wind and 
the far off sound of car engine that refused to turn over.

&quot;I think that&#39;s it up ahead,&quot; came the sound of Misty&#39;s voice, the 
quiet, barely audible words breaking the prevailing silence that had 
overcome them since passing through the city gates.

Miranda glanced up, her stormy gray eyes going wide behind the round 
lenses of her spectacles, her pulse racing as the dark shape of their 
destination loomed far closer than it had when the courier had first 
spotted it in the distance.

&quot;Is it like you remember it, dear?&quot; her lover teased, her gloved hands 
sliding around Miranda&#39;s waist from behind as the courier stopped in the 
middle of the empty street, lost in her own thoughts for a moment.

&quot;No,&quot; she whispered, closing her eyes and covering Misty&#39;s arms with her 
own as her beloved pressed closer, holding her tightly, sharing her 
warmth, &quot;it was raining that day.&quot;

Misty rested her head against Miranda&#39;s shoulder, closing her eyes and 
giving the courier a firm hug. &quot;It&#39;s alright, you know,&quot; she said 
quietly, ignoring the icy wind that threatened to cut through her heavy 
Winter coat as it blew about the trailing ends of her scarf.

&quot;I know,&quot; Miranda sighed, slipping off her fogged up glasses, her 
visible breath quickly slept away by the wind, &quot;It just feels weird, 
that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;You mean being here with me?&quot; inferred Misty, her voice sympathetic, 
lacking any trace of malice.

The courier nodded slowly, her stomach tying itself in knot. &quot;I&#39;ve been 
here off and on since that first time,&quot; she explained, Miranda&#39;s voice 
distant as she clung to her lover&#39;s arms, thankful for Misty&#39;s embrace 
to help fight off the foolish guilt she felt, &quot;But I&#39;ve only seen &#39;her&#39; 
once or twice since. I guess the in-city courier&#39;s do most of the Gym&#39;s 
deliveries. It&#39;s not that I&#39;ve avoided seeing Erika or anything, but 
now... I dunno. I just feel weird, that&#39;s all.&quot;

Misty nodded slowly, her own conscience nagging her at how uncomfortable 
her beloved was at being in Celadon. &quot;We can always hit the trading 
post,&quot; she said thoughtfully, &quot;Drop the package off and have the city 
courier deliver it. And then I could always run by for a Challenge on 
my-&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Miranda insisted firmly, shaking her head determinedly, &quot;I&#39;m not 
abandoning you. I knew what I was getting into when I signed on for 
this, and I&#39;m not giving up on it now. Besides, I doubt Erika will do 
anything to embarrass me, or make you jealous...&quot;

Misty laughed heartily, rocking Miranda gently as she lifted her head 
and looked out over at the large, square building with its glass dome 
set upon the center of its roof. &quot;Is that what you&#39;re afraid of, Miri my 
love? That I&#39;ll be jealous of Erika?&quot;

&quot;I know. I&#39;m being silly, I-&quot;

&quot;Shhh,&quot; came Misty&#39;s whispered reply, a small smile upon her face 
beneath the thick folds of her scarf, &quot;Don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ve talked about 
this. It&#39;s not as though you&#39;re surprising me with it just now or 
anything. I&#39;ve had enough time to prepare.&quot;

Miranda nodded as Misty let out a small, quiet chuckle. &quot;Although,&quot; she 
added mischievously, &quot;It also means that I&#39;m going to be just a touch 
merciless when it comes to my Challenge against Erika.&quot;

The courier laughed, awkwardly turning her head and smiling at last. 
&quot;You&#39;re going to have to be,&quot; she agreed a little teasingly, &quot;You&#39;ll be 
at a disadvantage against Triffid and Audrey.&quot;

&quot;Eh, I&#39;ll handle it,&quot; Misty assured with a dismissive shrug and a 
mischievous grin, &quot;After all, I&#39;m fairly certain that Leviathan and 
Umberlee should be more than enough to take care of Erika&#39;s tossed 
salad!&quot;

Miranda smiled, shaking her head in amusement. &quot;I adore your confidence, 
you know that?&quot; she said with a happy sigh, glancing up at the Gym with 
a renewed sense of well-being.

&quot;Oh, so you only love me for my confidence, then?&quot; teased Misty, 
slipping away and taking Miranda&#39;s gloved hand.

The courier chuckled quietly, once more leading the way across the urban 
tundra. &quot;Okay then. Since you&#39;re gonna challenge me...&quot; Miranda replied 
thoughtfully as they hovelled along upon their snowshoes, safely wrapped 
in five layers of Winter coats, heavy sweaters, long scarves, and woolen 
undergarments, &quot;The intensity of your beauty is a shining light whose 
radiance is unhindered by armor you must wear to protect silky softness 
of your skin. Is that okay?&quot;

&quot;Mmm, it&#39;ll do for now,&quot; chuckled Misty, all but hanging off Miranda&#39;s 
arm as they passed beyond the Gym&#39;s outer gates, left frozen open for 
convenience in one of the worst Winters in a century.

Miranda laughed as they hurried up the mostly clear walkway with its 
twin hills of snow on either side as the wind blew fiercely along the 
artificial pass between the seasonal mountains. Their short, awkward 
sprint brought them to the small alcove before the large wooden door. 
Adorned with an ornate silver doorknocker, its surface decorated with 
carved flowering vine patterns. Before they could knock, however, the 
door spring open as the two huddled in the doorway for a moment for 
warmth.

&quot;Come in! Come in!&quot; insisted a friendly female voice as the wind blew a 
short-lived hail of snowflakes into the foyer, &quot;It&#39;s freezing out 
there!&quot;

&quot;Thanks, miss,&quot; Miranda replied, giving Misty a gently push to ensure 
she got inside first, &quot;we weren&#39;t expecting you to be so prompt!&quot;

The woman who wore the long, abstractly patterned kimono of yellow and 
orange smiled as she hurried the courier inside and shoved the door 
thankfully closed. &quot;We knew you were going to be here some time this 
week, so we set up a watch when we heard about the coming storm.&quot;

Miranda nodded slowly by leaning her body forward slightly, her long 
dark purple and black scarf it almost impossible to move her neck. 
&quot;Erika always was fairly thoughtful,&quot; she commented, reaching up to 
untangle the knot of her scarf as the warmth of the Gym began to get to 
her.

&quot;My Lady believes in providing more than adequate hospitality,&quot; the 
woman said simply, tossing her long red hair over one shoulder as her 
guests unwound their scarves, and extricating themselves from their 
Winter clothing.

&quot;Does that include hot chocolate?&quot; Misty shivered; her cheeks flushed 
bright red from the cold and quickly stifling the jealous thought she 
told herself she wouldn&#39;t have.

The woman nodded. &quot;Anything you wish,&quot; she said with a mysterious smile, 
&quot;Within reason, of course.&quot;

&quot;Just being out of &#39;that&#39; is hospitality enough for me,&quot; replied Miranda 
with a nervous glance at her beloved as she struggled out of her coat, 
her brow sweating now that the Winter&#39;s cold was but a memory.

&quot;It&#39;s also getting close to lunch time if you&#39;d like to join us...&quot; the 
woman&#39;s voice trailed off as her dark eyes cast their way over to the 
wooden staircase that lead to the upper level.

&quot;I&#39;m certain that they will, Joyce,&quot; came a soft, feminine tone as 
figure in an almost flowing green and gold kimono glided down the 
staircase towards them. As the dark haired woman approached, her steps 
so graceful she nearly seemed to float as opposed to walking, she 
trailed her small, slender fingered hand along the dark wooden banister. 
Her touch light, like the caress of a lover.

Miranda looked up at the small woman and gulped down a sudden 
nervousness, reaching back blindly with a shaking hand before finding 
Misty&#39;s and clutching it tightly. &quot;E-Erika,&quot; she said with a small 
smile, &quot;It, it&#39;s been quite a while.&quot;

The Gym Leader smiled down at the courier, her emerald green eyes 
reflecting a subtle mischief as she descended at an unhurried pace, her 
small feet making no sound upon the carpeted wooden steps that had 
creaked beneath the feet of others.

&quot;Indeed, Miri, it has,&quot; she said simply, her smile mysterious and all 
knowing as her gaze seemed to look into the depths of Miranda&#39;s soul 
before turning to Misty and stifling a small quiet chuckle.

&quot;Oh my,&quot; said Erika, tapping her chin thoughtfully with her index finger 
as Misty&#39;s body tensed from the sudden effort not to blurt out anything 
she&#39;d regret, &quot;I remember you. It&#39;s been quite a while since you were 
here last but I seem to recall your name being Misty, correct?&quot;

Miranda winced as Misty&#39;s hand tightened around her fingers almost 
painfully. &quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; her lover replied with a forced smile, hating 
herself for the flare of jealously but feeling more annoyed by both 
Erika&#39;s reminder of an unpleasant memory and especially by the woman&#39;s 
blatant use of Miranda&#39;s nickname. &quot;And yes, about three or four years 
now I think,&quot; Misty added quickly, her free hand moving to touch 
Miranda&#39;s shoulder possessively, &quot;But, as they say. Much has changed 
since then.&quot;

Erika&#39;s eyes slid closed as she chuckled and took the last few steps. 
&quot;Fear not, miss, I noticed,&quot; she assured, holding her hand out to the 
trainer without any outward appearance of dismay, &quot;And actually, I&#39;m 
quite pleased that Miranda has found someone. I was rather worried about 
her when she left my company the last time.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m older and wiser now,&quot; the courier chuckled nervously, freeing her 
aching fingers and sliding her arm about her lover&#39;s shoulders, &quot;And I&#39;m 
quite pleased with my choice as well.&quot;

Misty tried a little unsuccessfully to keep her smile from seeming too 
smug as the courier kissed her cheek and Misty shook Erika&#39;s warm, 
inviting hand. 

&quot;Good,&quot; said Erika simply, releasing Misty from her gentle grip and 
turning to glide down the oddly shaped hallway whose right-hand wall 
curved slightly in response to the odd architecture of the building, 
&quot;now then, my assistant will provide for you for the time being. I fear 
I have a most pressing matter that I must attend to elsewhere. Please 
forgive me, but I will see you in time for dinner.&quot;

As the woman vanished around the corner Joyce turned to the couple and 
smiled sweetly. &quot;Please forgive my Lady, Winter is not her favored time 
of year,&quot; she explained, glancing over her shoulder a little worriedly.

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s no problem,&quot; assured Miranda, going back to undoing her boots 
as Erika&#39;s assistant took their coats and hung them up, &quot;I&#39;m not 
terribly fond of it myself.&quot;

Miranda then glanced at Misty as her lover kicked off her heavy boots 
and stepped carefully out of the foyer, doing her best to avoid the 
melting slush upon the cold tiled floor in an effort to reach the warm 
hardwood floor of the rest of the Gym. 

&quot;You okay?&quot; the courier inquired quietly, still not completely convinced 
that making the delivery together wasn&#39;t a mistake.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Misty replied softly, exhaling slowly as the courier 
extricated herself from her own boots and hopped out onto the drier 
floor, &quot;She&#39;s pretty, though, isn&#39;t she? Beautiful even.&quot;

Miranda&#39;s heart sank as Misty turned to walk away, but the courier 
quickly took her about the shoulder and spun her beloved back around to 
face her. &quot;Beautiful may turn my head,&quot; whispered Miranda quietly so 
that only Misty would hear as her arms slipped about her lover&#39;s waist, 
&quot;but cute rocks my world.&quot;

Misty attempted to stammer out a reply, but felt Miranda&#39;s lips pressing 
softly against her own, causing her tension and buried anger to melt 
away as she leaned into the woman&#39;s embrace.

&quot;I love you, Miri,&quot; Misty breathed as at last their lips parted, finding 
Miranda looking searchingly into her sea green eyes, &quot;please don&#39;t 
forget that.&quot;

&quot;It baffles me as to how anyone ever could,&quot; the courier replied, 
kissing Misty gently, &quot;Or how anyone could ever not love you...&quot;
