<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/jetiendo-ch35.html">Back to Part 35</a><pre>A month had past, Tasha and Gary got married, Kari has started getting 
further away from her girlfriend Misty, as they both sorted out there 
problems

Misty was at the large forbidden field of the royal castle, she spotted 
Ash and Gary jousting, those two used to be at each other&#39;s throats, now 
they where good mates, joking around like boys usually do. She

Looked at her ex with delight, she still had feelings for Ash,

&quot;Misty&quot; May said shyly behind her. Misty turned around

&quot; May,&quot; Misty, breathed as she looked at her, May joined her.

&quot;Sorry about the miscarriage &quot;

&quot; I wanted to surprise them sort of like&quot;

&quot;He certainly was surprised&quot;

&quot; May what did you think of me?&quot;

&quot; Well I kinda liked you, I wasn&#39;t trying to ruin your friendship with 
Ash, I only started to panic when I started growing feelings for him, 
was when I started to panic, you and Ash where soul mates, I was nearly 
eating myself up, I haven&#39;t regretted any of it, me, Ash, TK and Kari 
went out, TK and Kari left us as we danced. He&#39;s a good dancer, we left 
about early hours of the morning, very dangerous out there, and Ash got 
shot in the leg. I dragged him all the way back to the monastery, we 
went to the social area we where there until 6, Pikachu caught us 
kissing. He was furious first, then Ash explained and he accepted it, 
then Pikachu noticed Ash&#39;s leg was bleeding even worse, we called for 
help, got a doctor, when the doctors got there they noticed I was 
bleeding is well, we where both taken to hospital, then four hours later 
Max was also there,&quot;

&quot; To think that I nearly killed him,&quot; Misty wondered,

&quot; I&#39;ll try to talk to him&quot; May suggested

&quot;Thanks May&quot; Misty replied

Meanwhile Kari was turning into a nymphomaniac, her erotic libido was 
insatiable, all she was doing was staring at the mirror, and the baby 
bump was enlarging, she had nightmares of herself being a masochist. TK 
walked into her room, her depression was very noticeable,

&quot;Kari&quot; TK whispered gently, as he noticed her depression was bad. 
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;Nothing&quot;

&quot;Tell me, what is it? If you want something or someone, Misty I&#39;ll get 
her,&quot;

&quot;TK, I want sex&quot; Kari hissed &quot; I&#39;m sick of this celibacy, they say it&#39;s 
all for my baby&#39;s sake, what about my life I just want pleasure&quot;

&quot; I thought you wanted to be a virgin&quot; TK reminded her &quot;remember now, 
Kari&quot;

&quot;You said it wouldn&#39;t lose my virginity,&quot; Kari said coldly &quot; you also 
said I couldn&#39;t become pregnant, here I am, depressed teenager fucking 
pregnant, &quot; TK came closer, Kari kept the distance, &quot; I&#39;m surprised you 
forgive me,&quot; Kari hissed.

&quot;What do you want me to do&quot; TK asked angrily &quot; whatever you want I can 
give it you,&quot; Kari acting weird clinched his top and claimed his lips.

&quot; I think you know what I want&quot; Kari replied

They took eachother&#39;s clothes off as if it was their professional hobby. 
Sensual bodies felt natural, too them. But there&#39;s a catch, it may not 
be illegal in Jetiendo however shagging a pregnant girl, seems to be 
very disturbing and very disgusting according to some people whereas in 
Jetiendo it&#39;s very normal

TK and Kari where comftably naked in the bedroom, they could shag for 
hours. Pure pleasure was all that was in Kari&#39;s mind as she grabbed TK&#39;s 
purse. TK caught her holding her arm tight.

&quot;Caught in the act,&quot; TK hissed at her, Kari had an evil smirk.

&quot;TK&quot; Kari said in a sexy way, &quot;you male chauvinist pig&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re the prostitute&quot;

&quot;A molest now are you?&quot;

&quot; You masochist&quot;

&quot;Sadist&quot;

Then a priest walked in he was a very old priest spotted the two 
students having sex absolutely naked. The priest gasped. Fainted. 
Collapsed. Became uncoiuncus. And died. They both laughed in despair.

&quot;Finger me&quot; whispered Kari &quot;like you did before&quot;

He did. Touching the clitoris, resting his head on Kari&#39;s belly feeling 
his child&#39;s heartbeat,

&quot;Fucking hell,&quot; TK muttered, &quot; I&#39;ve never felt so bloody alive.&quot; Then 
the baby kicked him in the face. The sudden movement made insert his 
finger out instantly making Kari scream.

&quot;Bloody hell&quot; Kari pounded.

&quot;That was the baby&#39;s fault,&quot; TK replied &quot;it kicked me&quot;

Kari reached for TK&#39;s purse again.

&quot;I have to charge&quot; Kari muttered. &quot; You owe me &#156;2.50&quot; Kari emptied TK&#39;s 
purse then placed it in her purse. Then someone else came in the door, 
the grumpiest teacher in the world Mr Grinal. His face looked very 
disturbed.

&quot; This is unacceptable behaviour guys&quot; Mr Grinal boomed. Izzy, Tai and 
Matt looked out, as they had litter duty with Grinal.

&quot;GET IN THERE!&quot; the three boys shouted. Grinal turned around

&quot; Get on with the litter duty guys&quot; he said then he turned to TK and 
Kari &quot;30 seconds to get dressed&quot;

TK and Kari where busted

May came back after to Misty, she talked to her fianc&#130; her face filled 
with nerves,

&quot;What did he say?&quot; Misty asked hastily

&quot; Well there&#39;s no easy way of saying it,&quot; May said &quot; he said you&#39;re a 
fucking bicth, and you can piss off, he said to meet him before the 
wedding if you want things to be sorted out if I don&#39;t work it&#39;s 
eternal&quot; Misty&#39;s face filled with sadness, May had to give her sympathy 
&quot;sorry Misty&quot; May smiled &quot; I hope you and Ash make up someday&quot; May left 
she wore a pendant with the letters M.K. that came to Misty&#39;s attention 
that was the same necklace Ash brought her, she threw it at him after 
the last row.
