<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/jetiendo-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Ant and Dec where running a lesson as the students came in, books where 
all on the tables for them. 

&quot;Every one in &quot; Ant shouted then he whispered to Dec &quot; they&#39;re going to 
love our lesson. &quot; sit down&quot; he said to the class. 

&quot; Now with the equipment in front of you, kindly paid by Simon Cowell&quot; 
Dec started &quot; put the title pants&quot; 

The class laughed, &quot; Just do it&quot; Ant replied &quot; I want you to copy down 
these facts on the board 

Pant fact one Cavemen never wore pants- that is how they scared the 
dinosaurs away 

Pant fact two during the war, underpants where confiscated by the allies 
to make parachutes and pants for other soldiers 

Pant fact three if you where pants on your head you don&#39;t need to wash 
them often&quot; 

&quot;Now after you have copied al that I want you to copy down this song,&quot; 
Dec said &quot; it&#39;s a song called I got my head in my pants meanwhile Ant 
will be handing out a book called the queen&#39;s knickers I want you all to 
copy that down is well&quot; 

The class was filled with laughter. 

After everyone had finished his or her work on pants Dec started talking 
again. 

&quot; Now class&quot; Dec smiled &quot; put a new title Dec says build your own 
universe&#39;. Later we are going to build a 3-d model of the universe which 
you can eat&quot; 

&quot;Eat!&quot; Davis shouted out 

&quot;Yes!&quot; Ant replied, &quot;Eat!&quot; 

As we all know,&quot; Dec replied &quot;in our solar system there are nine planets 
of vastly different sizes so we&#39;ll need 9 completely different fruit and 
veg to make our 3-d model&quot; 

&quot;You will need a wire coat hanger&quot; Ant said to stretch out so you can 
push it through the centre of each fruit and veg in order of distance 
from the sun. After we&#39;ve done the models we will have a midnight feast&quot; 

&quot; Every thing you need is in the cupboard&quot; Dec announced &quot; so off you go 
make your universe&quot; 

The lesson was going well amounts the students. 

Ant went over to chat to Ash and May, as they used curry sauce and blue 
icing for their apples, blue icing for earth and curry sauce for Venus. 
Also they had Loads of bananas for the sun. 

&quot; Ant&quot; Dec shouted out &quot; have you seen my curry sauce and blue icing?&quot; 

&quot;No&quot; Ant lied &quot; you might have left it at England&quot; 

&quot;Oh yeah &quot; Dec replied. 

Meanwhile Davis left all the work to Ken on his 3-d model as he was 
throwing Brussels sprouts around the class 

&quot;HALEY&#39;S COMET&quot; Davis shouted as he threw them, Dec instead of telling 
him off joined in. 

Then a sprout hit Ant on the head. Davis stopped but Dec carried on 

&quot;DECLAN DONNERLY&quot; Ant roared 

&quot; Gotta go to the loo&quot; Dec said nervously and ran from the class room 

&quot;WAIT I&#39;M NOT FINISHED WITH YOU&quot; Ant shouted chasing him. 

By that time everyone had finished their 3-d models they threw sprouts 
across the classroom. 

Then the doors crashed open military forces frightening the class as 
they all went to the back. Then she entered Angelica and Shelito Paz the 
prime minister 

&quot;Lower your weapons&quot; Paz demanded to the military &quot; is they&#39;re an Ash 
Ketchum in the room. Ash stepped forward as every annoyingly glared at 
him. 

&quot;Well Angelica&quot; Paz smiled &quot; this is the king&#39;s son&quot; then pointing at 
him &quot; your nephew&quot; 

The class gasped at him 

&quot;Well&quot; Angelica hissed, &quot; he has a girlfriend, someone named May&quot; 

Then every one looked at May as the class walked away from May 

&quot;Girlfriend&quot; Paz hissed &quot; well in that case bring May with us&quot; Paz 
clicked his fingers 

The military clutched Ash and May took them out the class and threw them 
in the vans where there was an armed soldier at every corner
