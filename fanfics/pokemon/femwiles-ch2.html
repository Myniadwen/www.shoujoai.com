<a href="../pokemon/femwiles-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Hiroshi

&quot;Are you sure this is a good idea?&quot; I ask Imite, and she lets go of my 
wrist to smirk at me. &quot;Of course it is. I -- oomph.&quot; A slender dark 
haired girl pushes her way between us, muttering an excuse as she 
does. I blink, realising it&#39;s the Tamamushi city gym-leader.

&quot;Oh, frell,&quot; Imite groans, as Erika heads into the ladies room. &quot;I&#39;ll 
follow her. Stay here incase she tries to get out.&quot;

I blink, and Imite darts into the ladies room, and I&#39;m left there 
alone. Oh great. This is just wonderful.

I rock back on my heels and sigh. I wish they&#39;d hurry up... I mean, 
it&#39;s gotta look weird for me to be standing here and just waiting and 
not actually doing anything.

Oh, Hiroshi, you&#39;re letting yourself get paranoid.

Well, there&#39;s good reason!

And now you&#39;re talking to yourself. Stop it.

I sigh, and decide it&#39;s good advice to take, and look back at door to 
the ladies room. I start to hum, and then sigh. Uh, this isn&#39;t any 
better. This is, if anything, just worse, and...

&quot;Hiroshi?&quot; I blink and turn away from the bathroom. Satoshi stands 
there, confusion on his face in the low light.

&quot;Oh, hi Sato-chan,&quot; I murmur, and he takes my hands and looks into my 
eyes.

&quot;Is something wrong? I thought you were going to get us drinks...&quot; his 
voice trails off.

I blink. &quot;Oh, forgot about that, didn&#39;t I?&quot;

Satoshi laughs and kisses me long and hot and passionately. &quot;That&#39;s 
all right. But, are you all right?&quot;

&quot;Uh, yeah, I&#39;m fine.&quot; I reply, smiling.

&quot;Oh?&quot;

I nod.

&quot;And there&#39;s a reason why you&#39;re standing outside the ladies room, 
then?&quot;

I blink, and then cough, blushing slightly. &quot;Yeah, there&#39;s a reason,&quot; 
I almost say, but shake my head. &quot;No, no reason at all.&quot;

Satoshi smiles. &quot;Then come with me. Shigeru is trying to one-up me to 
Tooru so I need you there for moral support.&quot;

I smile, glad to be with him. Sure that Imite can sort out the problem 
in the bathroom, I let him lead me across the filled room. &quot;So, 
anything in particular?&quot; I ask.

&quot;Really?&quot; Satoshi replies.

&quot;Yeah, really.&quot;

Satoshi just grins wickedly. &quot;Actually, I just missed you. Is that 
okay?&quot;

I smile slightly and squeeze his hand. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s perfectly okay.&quot;

He grins and then waves. &quot;Told you I&#39;d find him, Shigeru.&quot;

&quot;Uh, I thought.&quot;

Satoshi laughs. &quot;I wanted both, okay?&quot;

&quot;Uh, okay...&quot;

He lets go of my hand and Shigeru rolls his eyes. &quot;I thought you were 
getting drinks.&quot;

&quot;Uh. I got distracted.&quot; I reply, and Shigeru shakes his head and turns 
to talking to Tooru.

I try and pay attention to them. Really, I do. I just keep happening 
to turn and glance back in the direction of Imite and Erika, and then 
towards the front where Kasumi and Natsume are... uh, I knew this was 
a bad idea. Why, why, why did I let them talk me into this? I 
shouldn&#39;t have... I shouldn&#39;t...

Satoshi touches my shoulder and I jump. &quot;What is it?&quot;

Satoshi blinks. &quot;Hiro-chan,&quot; he puts the back of his hand up against 
my forehead. &quot;Are you feeling okay? You&#39;re edgy and jumpy and everyone 
is staring at you...&quot;

I blink, sweating, and laugh nervously. &quot;Uh, I... I...&quot; my gaze shifts 
from him to Shigeru and Tooru, who definitely *are* staring at me. &quot;I, 
uh... just... gotta use the bathroom!&quot; I blurt, and then and turn and 
run back across the room, pushing past people and thankfully not 
tripping over anything or anyone major.

Uh, that wasn&#39;t good.

Sighing, I glance at the door to the ladies room, and then back in 
Satoshi&#39;s direction.

Don&#39;t, a little voice tells me, don&#39;t do it!

Uh, but what else do I have to do?

Gathering my courage, I step closer and closer. I gaze to check and 
make sure I&#39;m not being watched, hoping that the potted plant between 
it and the majority of the room will help keep prying eyes away, and 
then nudge the door open.

&quot;Hello?&quot; I whisper.

No answer.

&quot;Imite?&quot;

&quot;Hiro-chan?&quot; I hear the teal-haired girl reply.

&quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; I reply, not moving in any further than I have to. I hear 
the click of her heels on the tile, and then she comes round the 
corner, her shoes muffled now by the carpet of the waiting room. 
There&#39;s a definite a worried look on her face.

&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; she asks.

&quot;Well, I was worried about Erika and... you and... um... is everything 
all right?&quot;

Imite blinks and then smiles. &quot;Oh, we&#39;re fine. Erika and I are talking 
about *everything*...&quot;

&quot;Imite?&quot;

&quot;Mmm, I&#39;ll be right there, Erika!&quot; she exclaims, and then smiles, 
looking back at me. &quot;See, it&#39;s all okay. You&#39;re worrying over 
nothing...&quot;

&quot;Uh, okay. If you need me...&quot;

Imite laughs. &quot;I&#39;ll call, don&#39;t worry. But really, Hiro-chan, this 
*is* the girls bathroom... what do you think you&#39;re doing here?&quot; she 
asks, putting her hands on her hips.

I laugh. &quot;Kasumi already said it, Imite. I&#39;m already &#39;one of the 
girls&#39;...&quot;

She laughs and waves, shooing me away, and I close the door.

Well, if Erika&#39;s okay... then Kasumi is bound to be having the same 
success with Natsume. I take a deep breath, and head towards the exit, 
only to bump into someone. By a twist of fate and coincidence, it&#39;s 
Kasumi.

And there&#39;s such a sad look on her face...

Well, that theory just got shot out the window. &quot;I guess it didn&#39;t go 
well, huh?&quot;

Kasumi shakes her head. &quot;No. Natsume&#39;s dead-set that she made a fool 
of herself in front of Erika and she ruined it all... so she&#39;s left 
for the gym and she took my car.&quot; She finishes in a low voice.

I sigh. &quot;Well, we need to do something. We can&#39;t just ruin Natsume and 
Erika&#39;s chance... it seems Imite and Erika are having better luck. 
Maybe if we could just get the two of them to talk again... and not 
let either of them get away.&quot;

Kasumi smiles slightly. &quot;And here I thought you were against this, 
Hiroshi.&quot;

I shrug, grinning a flimsy grin. &quot;We&#39;ve started and if we don&#39;t finish 
it then it&#39;s only going to be worse. There&#39;s nothing else we can do.&quot;

Kasumi nods, slowly. &quot;Well, where are they?&quot;

&quot;In the ladies room...&quot; I laugh and Kasumi quirks an eyebrow at me. 
&quot;I&#39;ll let you check in on them, this time.&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you proffer a car for the continued existence of this 
mission?&quot;

I nod. &quot;Good idea. Good luck, Kasumi.&quot;

She just grins and winks. &quot;Me? Need luck. As if.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Imite

Erika looks up at me and rubs the tears off of her cheeks. &quot;Thanks for 
not letting him know about this,&quot; she whispers, and I nod, sitting 
down on the couch beside her.

&quot;It&#39;s okay. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have barged in here after you...&quot;

She shakes her head. &quot;No, no, I&#39;m glad... I just... Natsume...&quot;

I put an arm around her shoulder. &quot;What happened?&quot; I just wish she&#39;d 
tell me... I don&#39;t know how I&#39;ll help if she won&#39;t let me know.

She sniffles. &quot;I... Natsume... she...&quot;

&quot;You can do it, Erika...&quot;

&quot;She told me that she l-liked me. And then... she... well, I like her 
too.&quot;

&quot;So I thought!&quot; I exclaim, and Erika pulls away from me wide-eyed.

&quot;Imite...&quot;

I grin. &quot;See, I&#39;m so completely on your side! But silly Natsume... she 
shouldn&#39;t have run off...&quot;

Erika blinks. &quot;I... you mean... I&#39;m not weird? I thought she thought I 
was weird and...&quot;

&quot;Oh, no no no! You and Natsume are *meant* to be.&quot; I grab her hand and 
pull her to her feet. &quot;We&#39;re going to march out there and get Natsume 
and I&#39;m going to *make* her listen to you...&quot;

Erika blinks again, her features expressive. &quot;I-I... you...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m here for you, Erika. I started something and I&#39;m going to finish 
it...&quot;

She smiles slowly. &quot;Thank you. I... I *do* like her, Imite. And... I 
don&#39;t know why she left like she did...&quot; Erika closes her eyes, and I 
hear the door opening and closing. I look up to see Kasumi come round 
the corner.

&quot;Is everything okay?&quot;

I grin at her, and nod. &quot;Erika and I just finished our talk. So, were 
is Natsume? Outside, I hope...&quot;

Kasumi bites at her lip. &quot;Uh, funny you should mention Natsume...&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s here still, isn&#39;t she?&quot; Erika asks, dread in her voice.

&quot;Um, well...&quot; Kasumi looks flustered. &quot;No. She went back to the 
gym...&quot;

I look at Erika as her eyes widen. &quot;Oh no... I...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry!&quot; Kasumi exclaims. &quot;We&#39;re going to go after her. 
Hiroshi&#39;s off getting us a car...&quot;

I get up, and glomp onto Kasumi, kissing her soundly on the lips. &quot;Oh, 
Sumi-chan, you are just the best!&quot;

She&#39;s flustered even more as she steps back from me, laughing 
nervously. &quot;Don&#39;t thank me yet. We&#39;re still going to have to get 
Natsume to listen to us...&quot;

I clap my hand on Erika&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll listen to Erika. 
I mean, we *know* she loves her! And Erika feels just the same... I 
mean, don&#39;t you?&quot; I ask, gaze swinging back to her.

Erika nods, her hands clenching and unclenching. &quot;And I never thought 
I had a chance. She&#39;s always so busy and so am I and...&quot;

Kasumi laughs. &quot;Erika, don&#39;t let being a gym-leader get in the way of 
you and your love life. Shigeru and I can do it -- even if he spends 
most of his time in Tokiwa, while I&#39;m in Hanada...&quot; she sighs. &quot;Well, 
that&#39;s not the point. Your love and your work can co-exist. *That* is 
what counts.&quot;

Erika nods. &quot;You&#39;re right. I just... I&#39;m afraid of rejection.&quot;

&quot;Well, there&#39;s no chance *that&#39;s* going to happen!&quot; Kasumi exclaims. 
&quot;I know for a fact that she has it for you... she&#39;s just...&quot; Kasumi 
pauses, searching for the right word. &quot;The only thing I can say is 
afraid... she&#39;s afraid of feeling too much, I think... but you can 
show her that she&#39;s not meant to be cold and unemotional all her life, 
Erika. I *know* you can do it...&quot;

&quot;Like I said, you&#39;re meant for each other.&quot;

Erika nods slowly, determination building in her eyes. &quot;I can. I know 
I can... This isn&#39;t the first challenge, and by God I know it won&#39;t be 
the last!&quot; she gets up, the determination spreading through her form.

&quot;Well, what are we waiting for?!&quot; she demands. &quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot;

I smile, Kasumi smiles, and then we leave the bathroom.

Running right into the guys, of course...

&quot;Uh,&quot; Hiroshi laughs. &quot;Satoshi wanted to know why I wanted the keys 
and then Shigeru and Tooru got interested and...&quot; Hiroshi dangles the 
keys and I squeal. &quot;Oh, Hiro-chan, you&#39;re the best!&quot; I glomp him, and 
Kasumi groans.

&quot;And five minutes ago...&quot;

I shrug and kiss him on the cheek. Satoshi and Tooru are glowering at 
me. &quot;Uh. I can explain this...&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Shigeru asks, crossing his arms and quirking an eyebrow at me. 
&quot;Then explain.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, explain,&quot; says Tooru.

&quot;Well,&quot; and I dance over to him, sliding my arms around him. &quot;Natsume 
and Erika are in love and we&#39;ve decided that we have to get them 
together. It&#39;s for the good of the world that these two be given the 
chance to share their love!&quot;

Tooru blinks. &quot;Uh...?&quot;

&quot;And Hiroshi&#39;s involved why?&quot; Satoshi asks.

&quot;Yeah, I mean, you three make sense... but Hiroshi...&quot;

&quot;Oh, Hiroshi&#39;s just --&quot;

&quot;Say it and you&#39;ll pay, Imite!&quot;

I grin wickedly. &quot;-- one of the girls.&quot;

Hiroshi groans, and Satoshi is the first to start laughing.

&quot;Oh, Imite, I...&quot;

I slip away from Tooru, not before kissing Tooru deeply. &quot;Come on, 
girls --&quot;

&quot;Stop that!!&quot; Hiroshi whines.

&quot;-- Operation FemGymShipping, round two!! It&#39;s only just really 
begun...&quot;</pre>
