<pre>&quot;Ooowww...&quot;  Ash staggered along, clutching at his abdomen.

Which elicited an annoyed &quot;Hmph!&quot; from Misty.  &quot;Honestly, Ash,
I thought you&#39;d learned your lesson the last time you wolfed
down too much food.  Brock, just how much stomach medicine do
we have left this time?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not my stomach.  It&#39;s...ooww...&quot;

Ash nearly collapsed, but Misty caught him despite her
protests.  &quot;If you want to take a break, Ash, just say...&quot;

Brock, having stopped a couple steps ahead, looked back when
he heard Misty&#39;s voice trail off.  To his concern, Misty
seemed to have frozen.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;...uh...uh...&quot;

&quot;Misty?&quot;  Brock stepped back towards them, then stopped
himself when he saw what Misty had seen: a spotty trail of
blood, leading from over the last hill, down the dirt path,
and up to Ash&#39;s feet.  &quot;Uh-oh.&quot;

Ash tried to look unconcerned, but pain won out.  &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Ash, get down.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t feel like dancing right now.&quot;

&quot;No, I...nevermind.  Misty?&quot;

With a nod, Misty helped Brock pluck Ash from the ground,
rotate him to horizontal, and lay him flat.  She quickly undid
his belt and began tugging down his pants.

&quot;Umm, guys?&quot;  Ash blinked.  &quot;What are you...&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Misty intoned by way of completely ignoring him.  She
wiped a finger along the trail of red leading down his leg and
up to his boxers, found it still moist, and frowned.  &quot;I think
this is your department, Brock.&quot;  She quickly looked away,
turning her attentions to holding down Ash&#39;s legs.

&quot;Right.  Hold still, Ash.&quot;  Brock pulled down the
undergarment.

A few seconds of silence later, Misty frowned.  &quot;Brock?  What
is it?&quot;

&quot;Ah...this is your department after all.&quot;

&quot;Brock!  I&#39;m not-&quot;

&quot;LOOK!&quot;  Brock grabbed Misty&#39;s chin and tugged.

Misty relented, her eyes soon resting on a perfectly healthy
female groin.

&quot;Is...there a problem?&quot;  Ash seriously hoped her friends were
not about to get weird...or, if they would, that anything that
was about to happen would be forgivable in light of the mind
control they were obviously under.  Perhaps she would even
play along, partly to get whoever was doing it to come out
into the open...and partly because some of the possibilities
might not be so bad, if she had an excuse to deny wanting them
later.

&quot;Umm...no, no problem.  Brock, quit staring!&quot;

&quot;Oh, right, sorry!&quot;  Brock turned away and stood up.  &quot;I&#39;ll,
uh, just keep an eye out to make sure no one&#39;s coming.&quot;

&quot;You do that.&quot;  Misty set down her backpack and began
searching.

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re menstruating, Ash.  Congratulations on your first
period.&quot;

&quot;But only girls get that.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

Misty dug out a tampon and slid it into place.  &quot;This&#39;ll have
to do for now.  Thank goodness I always keep an emergency
supply in case it takes a while to get to the next town.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot;

&quot;Honestly.&quot;  Misty started putting Ash&#39;s clothes back into
place, until Ash recovered enough senses to bat her hands away
and finish the job herself.  &quot;Don&#39;t you even know the
difference between girls and boys?&quot;

&quot;Well...not much...&quot;

&quot;Doesn&#39;t your mother?&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Yes, she does,&quot; Brock sighed.

&quot;Brock?&quot;  &quot;You knew?&quot;

Brock nodded, still facing away from them.  &quot;She told me one
day while I was waiting for you to get back from the Orange
Islands.  She knew this day would come soon, but she knew
you&#39;d be able to help Ash adjust, Misty...even better than she
thought she could.&quot;

Misty blinked.  &quot;But...why?&quot;

&quot;&#39;Let Ash live her fantasy while she can&#39;, she said.  She was
afraid, once Ash knew the truth, Ash wouldn&#39;t want to be...&quot;

Ash shuddered.  &quot;A tomboy.  I always wondered why she kept
saying it was ok to be...&quot;

&quot;Yourself.&quot;  Brock sighed.  &quot;&#39;Tomboy&#39;&#39;s just a label, Ash, but
it&#39;s a part of you she did not want you to deny.  But she was
more afraid you wouldn&#39;t look forward to the future that much,
knowing what you would grow up to be.&quot;

A gust of wind whistled by, stirring up some dust to cover the
blood behind them.

Misty smiled.  &quot;She really doesn&#39;t know Ash that well, then.&quot;

Brock nodded.  &quot;She&#39;s probably thinking of how it was many
years ago, when men and women were different.  Now...*you&#39;re*
a gym leader, Misty, and there&#39;s nothing stopping Ash from
going all the way to league champion if she wants.  So Ash is
a girl.  This doesn&#39;t change anything.  We&#39;re still your
friends, Ash.&quot;

Ash was feeling her chest and confirming that the slim lumps
there were not, as she had feared, merely a spare tire riding
higher.

&quot;I don&#39;t think it even changes Misty&#39;s feelings about you.&quot;

Misty pinched Brock&#39;s ear, brought it to her mouth, and
yelled, &quot;WHAT ABOUT MY FEELINGS FOR ASH?!?!?&quot;

&quot;Nothing...&quot;

&quot;Grr...hmph!&quot;  She released Brock and put her arm around Ash,
leading her friend away.  &quot;Let&#39;s go find a river or something
so we can get you cleaned up.  If your mom entrusted me to
show you what it&#39;s like to be a girl, I won&#39;t fail her.&quot;

Brock followed them after a moment, carrying a rather confused
Pikachu.  He wondered just how long it would take for
demonstrating the more intimate details to become an excuse
for Misty to make Ash feel like a woman instead.
