<a href="../pokemon/keepbro-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>&#39;Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better 
than wine&#39; 

Tasha re-examined the Song of Solomon looking for hints about sex, it 
could be a way to relight the romance she once had. 

&#39;A bundle of myrrh is my well beloved bed unto me; he shall lie all 
night and betwixt my breasts&#39; 

Tasha was reminded of the romantic times she had once shared with Gary 
before she was Queen, how he would skip the skip the tours to hang round 
with her, then the time he emotionally proposed to her on Christmas day. 

I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet 
to my taste. He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over 
me was love, His left hand is under my head and his right hand doth 
embrace me Behold thou art fair my love&#39; 

Tasha had read the Song of Solomon all afternoon. Thou art fair was the 
praise stuck to her head. Knowing this would break her virginity and 
that Gary only just turned 16 while she knew it would be sexual 
immortality. 

&#39;Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet and comely is thy mouth&#39; 

Tasha sat in the monastary garden thinking of all the times where Gary 
kiss her, it was the greatest deeds of her life 

&#39;Thou art fair, my love there is no spot&#39; 

According to Tasha, Gary was unique, kind charming and full of energy. 
Tasha saw his good side of his personality. 

&#39;I am beloved&#39;s his desire is toward me&#39; 

Tasha enters into the Takaishi department at 9:00 in the evening, Gary 
was just about to go to bed, his face still full of stress 

&#39;His left hand should be under my head his left hand should embrace me&#39; 

As Tasha takes the plane back to Japan constantly reading the Song of 
Solomon hoping Gary was still passionately loved her 

&#39;I am a wall and my breasts are the towers: then was I in his eyes as 
one that found favour&#39; 

Tasha now realised what happened to her. Ash had poisoned her with a 
libido but she didn&#39;t mind, it was exiting she never had it before she 
was a pure virgin. 

&#39;Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or to a young hart upon 
the mountains of spices&#39; 

Tasha walked into Gary&#39;s bedroom in a lilac skimpy dress that no one 
would imagine her wearing, as she hugged Gary as if she hadn&#39;t seen him 
for a decade, this eventually leads to Tasha breaking her virginity 

As they slowly stripped Tasha felt pleasure and pain, during the 
intercourse she knew deep in her heart that she had sinned but 4 Gary&#39;s 
benefit she continued. 45 minutes later, they both got an orgasm, Tasha 
fell asleep in Gary&#39;s arms as the final nocturnal kiss of the night 
caused her to sleep, a tear fell down her beautiful face.&nbsp;She had lost 
her chastity.
