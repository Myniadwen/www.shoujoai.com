<h1>Lavender Ghost Story (part 11 of 23)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nikolai.html">Nikolai Mirovich</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/lavender-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>&quot;Water, Water Everywhere...&quot;

Misty stood before the sink, her sleeves rolled up as her hands lost themselves 
in the still warm dirty water, obscured by the remaining bubbles from the 
homemade dish soap. Beneath the water she searched for the last few knives and 
forks that always seemed to remain stubbornly hidden within the now unpleasant 
mixture.

As she glanced up at the small window before her, the darkness outside was so 
complete, that it reflected her image with near perfect clarity, except for the 
glare of the ceiling lamp. It was in the pseudo-mirror that she caught the image 
of Miranda, who after quickly drying off her hands, stepped up behind Misty with 
an amused glint in her eye.

Without saying a word, Miranda put her arms around Misty from behind, holding 
her for a moment and resting her chin upon her lover&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Feeling 
better, dear?&quot; Misty inquired, meeting Miranda&#39;s gaze in their shared 
reflection.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Miranda replied with a slow nod, lifting her head to give Misty a gentle 
kiss upon the neck before savoring the warmth of her lover&#39;s skin upon her lips 
for just a moment, and breathing in her comforting scent, &quot;I&#39;ve just been on 
this emotional roller-coaster ride all day, and it&#39;s just getting to me, &#39;tis 
all.&quot;

Misty smiled, shivering slightly at the unexpected affection, but giggling at 
the thought of how it would look if someone were to walk in. &quot;Well, as I said, 
I&#39;m here to make sure you stay at the high end,&quot; she replied, glancing down as 
Miranda&#39;s hands slid up underneath the loose fitting fabric of the light sweater 
she&#39;d thrown on before coming down stairs.

&quot;Looking for something?&quot; teased Misty, turning to accept a light kiss from 
Miranda as the courier&#39;s fingers slid lightly across her stomach and up towards 
her bosom.

&quot;Just feeling playful,&quot; her lover mused, her fingers expertly lifting the front 
of Misty&#39;s bra and simply bringing it up instead of undoing it before her hands 
slid across Misty&#39;s breasts and held them almost protectively.

&quot;Do you have a mysterious &#39;dishwashing&#39; fetish that I should be aware of?&quot; 
teased Misty, shivering at the pleasant sensation, her voice quavering in a 
pleasant manner as Miri&#39;s hands cradled her bosom the way one would a priceless 
artifact.

&quot;No, not really,&quot; Miranda replied, savoring the feel of the small, firm, and 
very warm rises she&#39;d cupped her hands over, gently fondling them as she moved 
to nibble Misty&#39;s earlobe and whisper, &quot;It must be the helpless victim thing.&quot;

&quot;Helpless?&quot; teased Misty, her hands rising from the water full of knives and 
forks that dripped with soapy water.

&quot;Oooh, even better,&quot; Miranda giggled, &quot;you know, you&#39;re beautiful when you get 
worked up.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Misty inquired, blushing a little as she set the utensils in 
the dish rack.

&quot;Any time you get angry, or determined, or get that adrenaline surge that comes 
from a really intense battle,&quot; explained Miranda, lowering her voice and 
suddenly sounding embarrassed, &quot;It really, really... Well, let&#39;s just say that I 
like it. A lot.&quot;

Misty couldn&#39;t help but laugh, quickly leaning back to kiss Miranda 
reassuringly. &quot;Sorry, dear, I shouldn&#39;t make fun of you,&quot; she replied 
apologetically, feeling Miranda&#39;s hands slip away, and leaving her with a bit of 
chill where once there was reassuring warmth, &quot;But at least I know I&#39;m not 
scaring you away.&quot;

&quot;Not much chance of that,&quot; assured Miranda, glancing out into the hall as Bob 
staged back towards the living room, looking like he&#39;d been shot in the stomach.

&quot;Good,&quot; Misty replied, yanking at the plug and letting the sink drain before 
turning to Miranda, holding her dripping hands before her, &quot;&#39;Cause I&#39;m just 
getting used to this being appreciated thing.&quot;

Miranda smiled sadly as she dropped a dishtowel over Misty&#39;s hands and began to 
dry them for her. &quot;I know, dear,&quot; she said quietly, taking a small pleasure from 
spoiling her beloved so, &quot;And if I have my way, one day you&#39;ll forget what it&#39;s 
like not to be.&quot;

Misty sighed contentedly, grabbing the towel away and tossing it over a near by 
chair before hugging Miranda tightly. &quot;I love you,&quot; she said quietly, her voice 
quavering.

&quot;Something wrong?&quot; Miranda inquired, holding Misty protectively and feeling 
suddenly concerned.

&quot;No,&quot; her lover replied, looking up at Miranda adoringly, &quot;I&#39;m just so happy 
that I&#39;m sad, that&#39;s all. Sometimes you&#39;re just too much for me.&quot;

&quot;Too much?&quot; the courier asked; feeling suddenly worried even as Misty shook her 
head and laughed.

&quot;No, no, Miri,&quot; she assured, &quot;I mean that sometimes you show me so much love and 
affection that I wonder where I&#39;ll put it all. Does that make any sense?&quot;

Miranda nodded. &quot;Yeah, it does,&quot; she replied carefully, &quot;I guess I&#39;m just making 
up for lost time or something. Looking to erase both our bad memories... That 
and I just never want there to be any doubt in your mind as to how I feel about 
you.&quot;

&quot;You haven&#39;t exactly been secretive about it,&quot; Misty chuckled, her hands moving 
up to hold Miranda&#39;s face as she moved closer, &quot;trust me, my love. I&#39;m not going 
anywhere without you, and I&#39;m not going to think you suddenly hate me just 
because you have other things on your mind.&quot;

&quot;Am I really that insecure?&quot; said Miranda rhetorically, glancing away as Misty 
pulled her forward and gave her a reassuring kiss.

&quot;Have I ever asked you to be an absolute pillar of strength?&quot; 

&quot;No,&quot; laughed Miranda, looking into he depths of Misty&#39;s sea green eyes 
searchingly for a moment, &quot;Infact you&#39;ve never asked anything of me. You&#39;ve been 
so completely unselfish that I almost feel guilty.&quot;

&quot;Strange,&quot; Misty pondered, &quot;I thought I&#39;d been kind of demanding.&quot;

Miranda gave her a curious look. &quot;Demanding? You?&quot;

Misty nodded. &quot;Dragging you from gym to gym, deriving self-esteem from your 
love, having you pay our way for the last nearly half a year!&quot;

&quot;As I recall, most of that was my idea,&quot; replied Miranda slyly, &quot;I think I&#39;m the 
demanding one here. I&#39;m the one who&#39;s expecting you to be all my dreams made 
manifest, making you listen to all my silly romantic notions, to put up with my 
putting you upon a pillar so high that you&#39;re almost more of a legend than a 
real person-&quot;

Misty covered Miranda&#39;s lips with her index finger as she tried not to laugh. 
&quot;Enough, enough,&quot; she whispered, turning towards the sound of a low growling 
that became a loud bark as someone opened the door, &quot;I think Laurna&#39;s back.&quot;

&quot;What was your first clue?&quot; chuckled Miranda as her aunt laughed at the 
growlithe&#39;s overreaction to her return.

&quot;Gee, which one loves her more, Frank or Bow?&quot; Misty pondered as they walked arm 
in arm out into the hallway.

&quot;I&#39;m glad Nezumi&#39;s not that bad,&quot; Miranda added smiling at the haunter that flew 
in over Laurna&#39;s shoulder and flew straight towards her.

&quot;Wraaa!&quot; exclaimed Wraith all too happily as Miranda held out her hand to her 
approaching haunter.

&quot;And where have YOU been,&quot; she inquired in a mock accusing tone.

&quot;He showed up when I was doing my &#39;lecture&#39; as you put it,&quot; Laurna explained as 
she hung up her coat in time to happily accept Frank&#39;s suddenly almost desperate 
embrace, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, though, he actually helped out a bit. And he didn&#39;t scare 
the children. Too much.&quot;

&quot;Well that&#39;s good,&quot; Miranda replied, holding onto Wraith&#39;s hand and laughing as 
he spun her around in a poorly executed pirouette, &quot;And it&#39;s good that you&#39;re 
back, Wraith. I need you for something.&quot;

&quot;Haunt?&quot; the ghost inquired, his ephemera seeming to ripple as he attempted to 
hold in all the energy he&#39;d consumed that day.

&quot;Hold on,&quot; his trainer explained, we need to get permission first.

The haunter nodded as Miranda leaned in through one of the entrances to the 
living room and caught sight of her mother. &quot;Is it alright if we use the 
greenhouse for a little while?&quot; she inquired, causing Vivian to glance up at her 
suspiciously, &quot;Misty&#39;s crew need some practice if they&#39;re going up against Viper 
tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;And Nox, and Shadow,&quot; added Laurna, happily sitting down upon the ancient couch 
with Frank as Bow immediately went into her &#39;I&#39;m helpless and can&#39;t jump all the 
way up there routine&#39; irregardless of the fact that she could jump down on her 
own just fine.

Miranda nodded, trying her best to look fearful as her mother calmly sipped her 
tea and thought about it for a moment. &quot;Only if you promise not to burn down the 
rest of the house,&quot; Vivian said at last, covering her suddenly sad tone with a 
smile, &quot;I&#39;m afraid that your grandfather was the last person in this house with 
a &#39;green thumb&#39;, so I doubt we&#39;ll be needing it ever again anyway.&quot;

&quot;Thanks mom!&quot; called both Misty and Miranda as they both hurried off down the 
hall, causing Frank to chuckle at Vivian&#39;s reaction.

&quot;You know,&quot; he commented, sliding his arm about Laurna&#39;s shoulders and petting 
Bow as she shot him a fiercely jealous look, &quot;Even with her moodiness, I don&#39;t 
think I&#39;ve seen Miri this happy in a long time.&quot;

Vivian nodded contemplatively. &quot;We&#39;ll see, Franklin,&quot; the courier&#39;s mother 
replied, &quot;We will see...&quot;

***

At the opposite end of the Lilcamp residence was a spacious, two-story glass 
structure with a pointed roof that was easily accessed by the nondescript door 
that Miranda&#39;s paternal grandfather had installed. Though the greenhouse had 
seen better days, many of its windows cracked and broken by the elements, both 
natural and supernatural, and the quadruple row of tables that once supported 
hundreds of clay pots had since collapsed to the equally cracked and broken 
cement floor, life still flourished within its walls. 

As Miranda hit the main switch, only half of the fluorescent bulbs that lit the 
structure came to life, and then after a full minute of waiting, most of them 
remained dim, with peculiar dark shapes floating about inside them as one of the 
empty light sockets sparked dangerously.

In response to the sudden, unexpected light, several small shapes shrieked and 
scurried into the dark safety of the thick underbrush created by decades of 
untended weeds allowed to spring up between the cracks in the floor and erode it 
further. At the same time, the sound of leathery wings was heard, as several 
zubats made a panicked escape from the sudden intrusion, causing both human 
intruders to jump and cover their heads as the blind pokemon flew out one of the 
still open ventilation windows at the top of the peaked roof.

&quot;This used to be a really nice place,&quot; Miranda explained sadly, breathing in the 
sweet smell of decaying vegetable matter and the warm smell of the soil, freshly 
tilled by various decomposers, &quot;but once my grandparents moved down to Maiden&#39;s 
Peak permanently, it only had my dad and his victreebel to look after it. And 
since my father had something of a &#39;brown thumb&#39;, he just sorta let it go. 
Treant lived here for a while, but after my Dad died, he took off into woods. 
He&#39;s probably gone to seed by now...&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; suggested Misty, uncertain as to the safety of the structure, let alone 
its inhabitants, but unwilling to show fear of them, &quot;They say that bulbasaurs 
make the flowers grow, so why not let Ivy loose in here from time to time. With 
Umi or Nezumi to look after her, of course.&quot;

Miranda nodded, a smile crossing her face. &quot;She&#39;d probably like it,&quot; she 
confessed, &quot;Especially in the Summer. It&#39;s like a sauna in here then!&quot;

&quot;Uh, more like a greenhouse,&quot; chuckled Misty, taking a step back as Miranda sent 
her a sideways glance and smiled.

&quot;Well, if that&#39;s the way you want to play,&quot; she replied with a wry grin, walking 
down the narrow path that remained and separated the two of the major weed 
infestations, &quot;I guess I&#39;ll just have to quit playing fair.&quot;

&quot;Well, just don&#39;t leave me here all alone,&quot; Misty replied, as Miranda turned to 
face her, standing at the opposite end of the greenhouse, &quot;That&#39;s definitely 
against the League rules!&quot; 

&quot;Oh, ha, ha,&quot; the courier teased, folding her arms across her chest and 
beckoning Misty a little closer with her index finger, &quot;Now then, any ideas what 
pokes you&#39;re gonna use? Aunt Laurna has three, so she&#39;ll more than likely want 
to use them all. Which means you&#39;re not in for an easy battle.&quot;

Misty nodded. &quot;Do you suppose she&#39;d let me use Leviathan?&quot; the trainer inquired 
skeptically, glancing nervously at the underbrush as she stepped closer, &quot;I 
mean, how much room do you suppose she has at her gym.&quot;

&quot;Oh, she&#39;ll have the room,&quot; assured Miranda, glancing about the greenhouse 
appraisingly, &quot;That&#39;s one of those rules you have to abide by if you&#39;re going to 
have a League sanctioned gym. I&#39;m afraid though, that he&#39;d tear the place down.&quot;

Misty nodded and held up a pokeball. &quot;Then I&#39;ll go with the old stand-by for 
now,&quot; she replied, squeezing the metal orb in just the right way, causing it to 
pop open, sending forth it&#39;s crimson glow, &quot;You&#39;re up Shadow!&quot;

The enormous star shaped pokemon materialized, and immediately stood proudly, 
facing Miranda with the round gem at his center gleaming dramatically in the 
poor lighting.

&quot;I see,&quot; Miranda replied, quickly reviewing Misty&#39;s roster as she pulled out a 
black and gray pokeball, expanding it from its storage size as she spoke, &quot;then 
Umberlee&#39;s probably your next best bet. It&#39;s harder to scare her and Shadow, but 
her weakness to ghost techniques could prove a problem. And Leviathan&#39;s not 
likely to realize he&#39;s supposed to feel fear. Which&#39;ll be a real advantage 
against a ghost specialist like my Aunt Laurna.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; inquired Misty, suddenly regretting her hasty decision as she felt dozens 
of curious eyes upon her, watching from the shadows.

Miranda nodded, wishing her beloved all the courage in the world as she met 
Misty&#39;s gaze from across the room and said quietly, &quot;Wraith, dear. It&#39;s time.&quot;

The surface of the colour-coded ball suddenly shimmered and was almost instantly 
covered by a thin, translucent green film that gave it a peculiar sheen.

&quot;Wha- what is that?&quot; Misty stammered as Shadow levitated slightly in 
anticipation.

&quot;It&#39;s only ectoplasm,&quot; Miranda explained, feeling a little guilty at having to 
purposely scare her beloved, &quot;But it might only be an illusion. Did you see me 
return Wraith before we came in here?&quot;

Misty shook her head and Miranda nodded grimly.

&quot;That&#39;s something you have to be careful of with ghosts,&quot; she explained as the 
green ooze bubbled at the seam in the ball, almost as though air were escaping 
through it. But a moment later, it became apparent that the closed opening was 
the source of the goo, &quot;They can disappear and reappear at will. Their natural 
state is invisible after all. Also, the one thing you absolutely have to 
remember when battling ghosts; is not to be afraid.&quot;

Misty pried her eyes off the ectoplasm that had now collected in Miranda&#39;s hand, 
and was even now dripping in long sticky strands to the floor where it pooled at 
her feet. &quot;Th-that&#39;s a little harder than it looks,&quot; she replied nervously, 
noting the way the green ooze sublimated loudly as it hit the concrete floor 
with unpleasantly wet sounding splatters.

Miranda nodded solemnly, seemingly unaware of the cold, sticky goo that was 
dripping off her hand and down her arm. &quot;Yes,&quot; she agreed, &quot;but it&#39;s important, 
my love. Because ghosts feed on fear. They can gain sustenance from any emotion, 
but fear is the sweetest. The best thing to do is not be the victim. Put the 
ghost in its place. Show it who&#39;s stronger of will and who&#39;s in charge. I had to 
do that with Wraith the first time we met, and now everything&#39;s fine. Remember, 
fear is the greatest weapon in a ghost&#39;s arsenal, take that away, and you&#39;ve won 
half the battle.&quot;

Misty nodded, chastising herself for the involuntary shiver that passed through 
her as a dark shape began to rise from the pokeball in Miranda&#39;s hand. It began 
by flowing into air, a curling black smoke tinged with darkest purple that 
slowly formed a wide malevolent grin, and filled the air with an ethereal 
chuckling that sent unpleasant chills through Misty&#39;s body.

&quot;But just remember, my love,&quot; Miranda added, her entire focus on Misty, &quot;That 
you can loose or win a battle even before it begins. You have Leviathan; you&#39;ll 
have the same advantage as Aunt Laurna does tomorrow. He may not scare her 
ghosts, but he may make her think twice.&quot;

Misty smiled nervously, the thought of the gigantic sea serpent looming over the 
small forms of Laurna&#39;s ghosts and making the woman think twice, even for a 
moment sending a reassuring feeling through her.

&quot;Very well then,&quot; she replied, bravely meeting Wraith&#39;s baleful gaze as he fully 
materialized and cackled menacingly, shall we begin?&quot;

Miranda smiled, nodding slowly as Wraith&#39;s illusionary ectoplasm vanished. &quot;You 
know,&quot; she commented offhandedly, making Misty smile, &quot;Ghosts only exude 
ectoplasm when they pass through solid objects. Don&#39;t be fooled, my love.&quot;

&quot;Got it!&quot; called Misty, adrenaline suddenly surging through her the way it 
always did before a battle, &quot;Alright, Shadow! Let&#39;s show &#39;Fang Face&#39; over there 
what you&#39;re made of! Swiftness, now!&quot;

Miranda stopped herself from commenting as the staryu&#39;s center gleamed and a 
hail of tiny five pointed stars spun out in a wide cone, like a hail of glowing 
golden shuriken as Wraith looked on, seemingly bored.

&quot;Um, Misty-?&quot; the courier began as Wraith made a show of yawning widely and 
stretching as Miranda scrambled out of the way and the cloud of hardened kinetic 
energy passed harmlessly through the haunter, and shattered their way through 
several windows behind him.

&quot;Now, Shadow!&quot; the trainer ordered, leaping off the ground and flinging her arms 
into the air in her excitement, &quot;While he&#39;s distracted! Neptune&#39;s Might!&quot;

But her staryu was way ahead of her, having long since learned to anticipate his 
human&#39;s tactics. By the time his attack had reached Wraith, Shadow was already 
spinning at top speed, his five arms already releasing a fine mist of water that 
the surrounding plants surely appreciated. At Misty&#39;s command, however, Shadow 
arched the ends of his arms forward and forced water through their ends with all 
his might, sending forth a spiraling blast of hydrokinetic force.

&quot;Don&#39;t underestimate me, my love!&quot; Misty laughed as Wraith&#39;s eyes bulged and he 
made a loud, unpleasant gargling noise in response to being hit in the open 
mouth.

&quot;I- I see,&quot; Miranda replied, taking several steps back into the waist high 
assortment of wild plants, and stepping up onto one of the collapsed tables as 
her haunter&#39;s body began to expand as he took in water. 

&quot;Wraith?&quot; she called in a worried tone, as the haunter&#39;s body became an ever-
expanding enormous round ball with a pair of relatively small hands as he 
floated, and Shadow continued his attack, &quot;Are- Are you alight, dear?&quot;

The haunter&#39;s now relatively beady eyes gave Miranda a sideways glance as his 
hand gave her the thumb&#39;s up. &quot;How &#39;bout you, Shadow?&quot; Misty inquired, her voice 
wavering a little as she watched in awe as Wraith&#39;s body swelled to a size that 
would have made it impossible for him to fit in her bedroom at home.

The staryu gave a wary affirmative, but his pace began to slow, and the his 
quintuple jets of focused water soon petered off to nothing, leaving a very 
large, very strange looking ghost floating uncomfortably in the center of the 
green house.

&quot;Wraith?&quot; inquired Miranda cautiously, stepping down onto the spongy ground and 
walking around to the front of the haunter&#39;s bulk with a concerned look upon her 
face, &quot;You okay?&quot;

That haunter made gestured to his mouth, his eyes looking frantic as his body 
made unpleasant sloshing noises. &quot;Just spit it out, dear,&quot; his trainer said in a 
maternal tone that was full of sympathy, &quot;You know it&#39;s not good for you.&quot;

Wraith caught Miranda&#39;s eye and made several panicked gestures as Misty crept up 
nervously. &quot;Is he okay?&quot; she asked as the haunter tried desperately to 
communicate his distress.

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s just his pride,&quot; Miranda sighed warily, &quot;Hold on, I think I know how 
to fix this.&quot;

&quot;You think?&quot; Misty replied as the courier dashed for the exit and ran down the 
hall, &quot;You mean this has happened &#39;before&#39;?!&quot;

&quot;No, no!&quot; assured Miranda, running back into the greenhouse, slightly out of 
breath as she smeared something green and gooey across her tattered looking 
bokken and walked calmly up to Wraith, &quot;It&#39;s just that he&#39;s trying to be funny. 
Wraith can be kinda stubborn that way. Okay, stand back!&quot;

Misty yelped as Miranda spun her sword counterclockwise over her wrist, sending 
the ectoplasm she&#39;d smeared across its length splattering in all directions, and 
taking a step back as she focused on her pokemon. &quot;Okay, Wraith,&quot; she warned, in 
her best &#39;not taking any crap from you&#39; tone, &quot;Either spit it out, or we do this 
the hard way!&quot;

&quot;Mmm, mmm! Mm! Mmm!&quot; replied Wraith, pointing desperately at his mouth with both 
hands, his eyes thrice as large as normal and full of alarm.

&quot;Alright then!&quot; Miranda exclaimed, raising her sword two handedly over her head, 
just as Frank stepped into the room, &quot;You asked for it!&quot;

&quot;Hey, guys,&quot; said the cop, just as Miranda&#39;s ectoplasm soaked sword swung down 
and hit wraith between the eyes, &quot;What&#39;s u-?! Ah! Nooo!!!&quot;

The haunter exploded in a blast of dark purple ephemera, ectoplasm, and more 
water than seemed possible, sending his trainer flying backwards into Frank who 
found himself gripping the sides of the doorway as a torrent of strange water 
blasted past him, down the hallway. 

&quot;Haun... Terrr...&quot; muttered Wraith, now back to his normal proportions and 
spinning slowly in mid-air, looking dazed, a meter or so off the ground.

&quot;Oh dear!&quot; laughed Misty; standing up from where she&#39;d hid in the underbrush, 
&quot;Is everyone okay?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m getting too old for this...&quot; Frank muttered, wiping ectoplasm out of his 
eyes.

&quot;Well, I think that&#39;s enough training for one night,&quot; Miranda replied with a 
smile that quickly vanished as her mother wheeled her way down the hall and 
looked disapprovingly down at her daughter who&#39;d landed hard on her butt once 
the torrent had subsided.

&quot;Miranda, dear,&quot; Vivian said simply, &quot;I thought I told you not to burn down the 
rest of the house.&quot;

&quot;D-does flooding count?&quot; her daughter inquired weakly with a meek smile that 
actually caused Vivian&#39;s stern expression to soften a little.

&quot;Actually,&quot; offered Misty, &quot;I&#39;ll just get Shadow to reabsorb the water before it 
causes any permanent damage.&quot;

Vivian turned to her with a curious expression and nodded. &quot;Please do, dear,&quot; 
she said simply, &quot;I&#39;d rather not have a flooded basement.&quot;

Shadow needed no coaxing, and levitated his way past Vivian, hydroplaning across 
the hardwood floor as he sucked the water back into himself. &quot;Useful trick,&quot; the 
woman commented, shaking her head at Frank and backing up into the house as 
Laurna stepped carefully out into the greenhouse. 

&quot;So?&quot; she inquired brightly, catching Misty&#39;s gaze as Miranda wrung out the 
front of her shirt, &quot;Are you ready for tomorrow?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but right now I think the best thing for me is to take a shower and go to 
bed,&quot; she replied with wary amusement.

&quot;The country air&#39;ll do that to you,&quot; Laurna agreed, &quot;Oh, and I should ask before 
I forget. How do you like your tea, dear?&quot;

&quot;Same as Mom, strangely enough,&quot; chuckled Miranda, slogging her way back down 
the path as Misty gave Laurna a quizzical look.

&quot;Good,&quot; the professor/gym leader replied with a nod, reaching into her back 
pocket and giving Misty a bemused glance. &quot;Oh, and here.&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot; the trainer inquired, holding out her hand as Laurna deposited two 
ancient copper coins into her palm.

&quot;You&#39;ll need these tomorrow,&quot; Laurna explained, glancing at her niece 
mischievously, &quot;It&#39;s traditional...&quot;

***

Miranda&#39;s room seemed even more invitingly cozy as Misty closed the door behind 
them and Miranda turned on the small table lamp she&#39;d had since she was a child, 
looking a little embarrassed by the little plastic dragonite that stood amongst 
the plastic trees at the base the lamp stood on, and lampshade that portrayed 
excessively cute looking dratini&#39;s.

&quot;You know,&quot; commented Misty, bouncing several times on Miranda&#39;s bed as she sat 
down upon it, the fuzzy bathrobe she wore making her feel comfortable and safe, 
&quot;I think your mother was actually amused by what happened.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s good!&quot; Miranda replied, sitting at her desk/dressing table and glancing 
over at Misty&#39;s refection behind her, &quot;I&#39;d hate to have her giving me that 
disapproving look the entire time for the next few days. But you&#39;re right; she 
did seem to think it was funny, though she&#39;d never admit it. It must be because 
Frank&#39;s in town, and Aunt Laurna&#39;s all happy again.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t suppose it&#39;s because of you, do you?&quot; Misty inquired, a sly smile 
crossing her lips as Miranda sent her back a quizzical look in the mirror and 
went back to brushing out her still wet tangles.

&quot;Me?&quot; she inquired as Misty got up and took the brush from her.

&quot;Yes, you!&quot; laughed Misty, setting the brush down and dealing with the worst of 
the tangles manually, &quot;Tell me something, Miri. When was the last time you 
laughed in this house?&quot;

&quot;I dunno,&quot; she replied with a shrug, gritting her teeth as Misty yanked her hair 
a bit trying to undo what looked to be a knot that Boy Scout could be proud of, 
&quot;Last year, I guess. Maybe...&quot;

Misty sighed heavily, picking up the brush again and holding Miranda&#39;s hair out 
as she brushed it from underneath. &quot;I mean really laughed,&quot; she corrected, &quot;Or 
said or did something really silly, like run into the house for your bokken to 
stop Wraith from doing something stupid. Or when faced with your mother&#39;s wrath, 
just looking up at her and smiling like you did.&quot;

Miranda&#39;s stormy gray eyes looked up at Misty thoughtfully for moment as the 
girl smiled back at her. &quot;Not recently, I don&#39;t think,&quot; her lover replied, 
&quot;Miri, you&#39;ve changed since last time you were here. Maybe you haven&#39;t noticed, 
but I&#39;ve seen the looks your Mom and Bob exchange now and then. They&#39;re 
surprised, their happy and they&#39;re just a tiny bit suspicious.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s my fault,&quot; Miranda said quickly, &quot;Last time I started to get this way, I 
was madly in love with the wrong person. Definitely NOT the other half of my 
soul, I can say that for certain now. Mother&#39;s just concerned that it&#39;s going to 
happen again, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;So what did happen?&quot; Misty inquired, changing her angle of attack and brushing 
Miranda&#39;s hair from the top, &quot;You said he left you for someone else, but...&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s not much more to tell, really,&quot; Miranda replied solemnly, &quot;You can read 
my diary if you&#39;d like, but the last parts are a little incoherent. You know, if 
I hadn&#39;t found Wraith, I never would have returned home at all? Pretty scary, 
eh?&quot;

&quot;Almost as scary as he is,&quot; teased Misty in agreement, giving Miranda a 
reassuring hug that was as much for Miranda as it was for herself.

&quot;And if it wasn&#39;t for Erika,&quot; Miranda added more than a little nervously, &quot;I 
very much doubt that I&#39;d have had the courage to approach you. Let alone 
remember how to fall in love with you.&quot;

&quot;Erika?&quot; Misty inquired, hoping her tone didn&#39;t sound suspicious, even as she 
forced down the jealously she absolutely refused to feel, &quot;I seem to recall you 
mentioning her before.&quot;

&quot;The Gym Leader in Celadon City,&quot; Miranda explained, looking a little nervous, 
and feeling more than a little nervous about explaining it, &quot;Aunt Laurna 
mentioned her at dinner in an attempt to embarrass me, and probably gauge your 
reaction.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; Misty replied, wincing as she realized her tone sounded harsh, &quot;I 
met her once. Interesting woman.&quot;

&quot;Um, yeah,&quot; chuckled Miranda nervously, glancing down at the pictures stuffed in 
the corners of the mirror to hide how uncomfortable she suddenly felt, &quot;I owe 
her a lot. She helped me get rid of some of my bitterness, and helped me to move 
on so I could love again. So as I said, if it wasn&#39;t for Erika, I wouldn&#39;t be 
here with you right now.&quot;

Misty smiled a little as Miranda reached up and took her hands, finally meeting 
her gaze in the mirror. &quot;She was one of your other lovers, wasn&#39;t she?&quot; Misty 
inquired quietly, her tone sounding painfully neutral.

Miranda nodded. &quot;Y-yes,&quot; she admitted, struggling to find just the right words, 
&quot;Her and another girl at the Gym, actually. But it was... &#39;Different&#39;, if that 
makes any sense what so ever. I dunno, I think they did it to show me that 
making love wasn&#39;t just a selfish, one-sided thing. That it could be a 
beautiful, wondrous experience, and certainly more interesting than the same old 
boring things my first love seemed to want all the time... 

&quot;They showed me things, and opened my mind, Misty. But you, you showed me that 
my time there wasn&#39;t wasted. You showed me that I did recover, that I could love 
again, and that there was someone out there who could love me back.&quot;

&quot;Di- Did you love her?&quot; Misty inquired quietly, bowing her head and feeling more 
insecure than she had in months.

&quot;Goodness no!&quot; Miranda chuckled, pushing her seat back and guiding Misty into 
her lap, &quot;It wasn&#39;t like that. And it wasn&#39;t just a cheep fling either. It was a 
learning experience. And it was part of something greater; everything we did 
those few days was designed to give me back my self-esteem. Can you imagine me, 
being nervous, and unsure of myself? Questioning every decision, especially when 
it came to relationships? Thinking that everyone out there was just going to 
hurt me in the end like he did? Not to mention always being on the defensives 
and taking compliments like they were insults.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; whispered Misty in reply, shaking her head as she leaned into Miranda&#39;s 
embrace, &quot;You&#39;re a beautiful, confident woman who could stand up to any 
challenge without fear. It&#39;s one of the things that I love about you.&quot;

&quot;And it&#39;s also one of things I love about you,&quot; Miranda replied, causing Misty 
to look up into her eyes, her expression so sad that Miranda&#39;s heart felt as 
though it would shatter.

But when Misty smiled, Miranda couldn&#39;t help by cry. The beauty she saw before 
her, the deep love and trust in Misty&#39;s eyes causing her mind to simply let go 
as she held onto her lover as though her life depended in it.

&quot;Miri, I-&quot; Misty stammered, taken back by Miranda&#39;s sudden outburst, as she 
clung to her and cried upon her shoulder.

&quot;Misty...&quot; Miranda sobbed quietly, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry...&quot;

&quot;Shh, it&#39;s okay, dearest,&quot; she soothed, running her fingers through Miranda&#39;s 
damp tangles, &quot;It&#39;s alright. I appreciate your honesty. I&#39;ve never known someone 
who loved me so much that they&#39;d actually risk loosing me. Miranda, I love you. 
What more... What more can I say?&quot;

Miranda sniffled, and looked up into Misty&#39;s eyes, seeing that she too had 
started to cry. &quot;Nothing,&quot; she assured, running the backs of her fingers down 
Misty&#39;s cheek lovingly, &quot;Just know that I love you as well, and that I never 
want to keep secrets from you. It&#39;s too important to me that you know the real 
me. That you have no illusions about who I am, or what I&#39;m capable of. I just 
want to know that you&#39;ll be there on, the last day that I live. That on that day 
your love for me will be as strong as it is now...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;ll be stronger,&quot; promised Misty, hugging Miranda as she rocked gently back 
and forth, &quot;And yes, I&#39;ll be there. And if Sylph Co develops an immortality 
serum tomorrow, then I&#39;ll stand at the end of time, with you by my side. 
Nothing&#39;s going to change that. I promise you, my dearest Miri, I love you, and 
I always will.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s all that I ask,&quot; Miranda replied contentedly.

Misty smiled happily, and slid out of Miranda&#39;s lap. &quot;You know, I do have one 
more unanswered question,&quot; she added strengthening her resolve as she glanced 
nervously at Miranda&#39;s bed as the nagging thought wore down Misty&#39;s defences.

&quot;Now&#39;d be the time,&quot; Miranda chuckled, shivering as Misty&#39;s warmth left her.

&quot;Have you ever...? In this bed I mean...?&quot;

The courier smiled, trying not to laugh at the sudden shyness in Misty&#39;s tone. 
&quot;No dear,&quot; Miranda assured her, sliding her arms around Misty&#39;s waist from 
behind and hugging her affectionately before moving to turn down the blankets, 
&quot;Believe it or not, you&#39;ll be the first person I&#39;ve shared this bed with. Well, 
like this anyway.&quot;

&quot;Lucky me,&quot; Misty teased, letting her bathrobe fall from her shoulders before 
eagerly sliding between the sheets as Miranda followed suit, immediately seeking 
out their shared warmth once again.

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t be so surprised,&quot; Miranda giggled, feeling a little embarrassed by 
the admission, &quot;I was embarrassed more easily back then, so bringing someone 
home like this was sorta out of the question. Not that anyone would have said 
anything, but still...&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad you waited,&quot; replied Misty, playfully tapping Miranda on the 
nose with her finger, before snuggling closer and looking thoughtful for a 
moment. &quot;Hey, is it just me,&quot; she asked, &quot;Or is this bed more comfortable than 
the one you got me?&quot;

&quot;Jealous?&quot; Miranda chuckled, entwining her legs through Misty&#39;s, more for 
comfort than warmth, as the heavy comforter above them blocking the lingering 
chill in the room.

Misty laughed, giving Miranda a teasing kiss as she spoke. &quot;Maybe a little,&quot; she 
admitted, &quot;But I suppose it makes sense that this one would be nicer. It&#39;s 
homemade, right?&quot;

&quot;You noticed?&quot;

Misty nodded, glancing up wooden headboard, carved with odd looping designs, 
which formed interesting patterns that seemed different every time she looked at 
them. &quot;I recognize the artist&#39;s work,&quot; she explained with a smile, &quot;I&#39;m glad to 
see creativity runs in your family.&quot;

&quot;Gallops,&quot; Miranda agreed with a yawn.

&quot;It&#39;s hard to argue with that,&quot; Misty agreed, shivering inadvertently as the 
wind rattled the window pains, &quot;Oh, and that reminds me. What&#39;s the plan for 
this Winter?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll pick you up some snowshoes at the trading post,&quot; said Miranda with a 
shrug, &quot;You know, normally I don&#39;t like the Winter. But this year, I think it&#39;ll 
be good.&quot;

&quot;Oh? And why&#39;s that?&quot; Misty inquired with a smile, knowing Miranda far too well 
to think it was just a simple comment.

&quot;Because,&quot; her beloved replied, trying to sound serious but not completely 
succeeding, &quot;It gives me an excuse to hold you more often.&quot;

&quot;You need an excuse?!&quot;

&quot;Well, just so you don&#39;t think I&#39;m clingy or anything...&quot;

Misty laughed. &quot;Until I met you, Miri,&quot; she explained wryly, hiding the sadness 
in her tone as best she could, &quot;I didn&#39;t know what affectionate was. Trust me, 
I&#39;m due.&quot;

&quot;Then you&#39;ve come to the right place,&quot; assured Miranda, giving her a kiss 
goodnight, &quot;Just always remember to speak up it if I ever go to far.&quot;

&quot;As if,&quot; Misty laughed, snuggling closer as Miranda reached over to shutout her 
mildly embarrassing bedside lamp, &quot;Goodnight, Miri. I love you.&quot;

&quot;I wish I could sum up my feelings that easily,&quot; the courier replied, setting 
her glasses down and shutting out the darkness, &quot;but for now, I love you will 
just have to do.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll find a better way,&quot; Misty chuckled before yawning, &quot;It&#39;s what you do. 
Sleep well my, love...&quot;</pre>
