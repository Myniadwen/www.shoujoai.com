<h1>Keep Thy Brother Safe (part 3 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/keepbro-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Kari cradled her little daughter Rosette after the hotel she slept with 
while she had the lesbian affair with Misty. The affair had to be put to 
one-side for the momement.&nbsp;Rosette had just been born three months 
ago.&nbsp;TK couldn&#39;t be any happier; Kari was only thinking about one 
person. Misty. They both seemed quiet. It&#39;s nothing personal however 
their relationship was at its lowest point ever during the trip at 
Jetiendo that was suppose to last 3 weeks; instead the trip lasted 6 
months.&nbsp;If you&#39;ve read dirty Jetiendo you could take the facts that TK 
slapped Kari round the face, jealousy of Ash and May, alcohol, also 
don&#39;t forget Kari&#39;s lesbian affair with Misty. Good reasons to split up 
on either side or you could ask why did they get back together if they 
knew what they let themselves in for. 

Kari wanted to see Misty and run away with her, but her friends and 
family keep reminding her of Rosette and TK they should be her number 
one priority therefore Kari gets upset because of this on the other hand 
it could be postnatal depression, loads of mothers seem to get it after 
labour. She did want Rosette and Misty not TK she wished she could just 
push him away as if he never existed at all, as if he wasn&#39;t the father 
of Rosette. At last they had a conversation 

&quot;Kari, Patamon and me are going for a walk... we&#39;ll be back soon,&quot; 
Gatomon told her partner, Kari nodded and the two digimon left the 
apartment. 

&quot;Kari, how do you feel about us?&quot; he asked her, what he was leading up 
to was a delicate subject but he didn&#39;t want to leapt into it. 

&quot;I feel wonderful about our relationship&quot; lied Kari poisoning 
herself&nbsp;&quot;who could ask for a better boyfriend then you, but...&quot; Kari 
stuttered the painful truth had to come out 

&quot;But what?&quot; TK asked 

&quot;Well ya know the time when you slapped me around the face&quot; Kari 
whispered 

&quot;That was ages ago, just a memory&quot; TK replied 

&quot;To you it is&quot; Kari whispered, loud and bitterly &quot;but to me,&quot; Kari 
started to cry holding Rosette in her arms&nbsp;&quot; I was and I&#39;m now still 
scared of what else you&#39;ll do to me rape, more violence, neglect....&quot; 

&quot; That won&#39;t happen!&quot;&nbsp;TK spat out. 

&quot; How do you know? How can you be sure?&quot; 

&quot; Because I love you! And because I won&#39;t let it happen!&quot; he argued. 

&quot; Just get out T.K.&quot; 

&quot; Kari-&quot; 

&quot; Just get out!&quot; she yelled 

&quot; No!&quot; he protested. &quot; I won&#39;t! Not until you tell me the real reason 
why!&quot; 

&quot; Because I don&#39;t love you!&quot; the silence, heartache, relief anger and 
hatred filled the apartment 

&quot;Is that why you&#39;ve cheated on me?&quot; he asked her; at those words Kari 
froze and stared at him with startled eyes. Then turned away looking at 
Rosette she didn&#39;t deserve him to look at her anymore. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; Kari cried in agony &quot;I never meant to hurt you, just Misty 
was the only one who understood me at the time, then it sort of got 
closer, we kisses, had sex but when every one discovered I was pregnant 
we sort&#39;ve drifted away.&quot; Kari&#39;s tears turned to anger &quot;it&#39;s over, it 
doesn&#39;t matter what anyone else wants us to be it&#39;s gone&quot; 

&quot;Yeah it&#39;s been over for a long time Kari, between you and me,&quot; he 
whispered, and then he opened the door and stepped outside ignoring the 
sound of his daughter crying.&nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m sorry Kari, but I guess we weren&#39;t 
meant to be,&quot; he whispered sadly wiping away his tears; he got up and 
slowly walked completely heart broken.
