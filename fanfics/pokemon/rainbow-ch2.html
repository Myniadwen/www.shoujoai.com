<h1>Rainbow Reminiscence (part 2 of 18)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nikolai.html">Nikolai Mirovich</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/rainbow-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The twin glass doors swished quietly closed behind her as Erika paused 
and took a deep breath of the fragrant, almost Spring-like air of her 
garden. &#39;She&#39;s changed so much, yet in all the right ways,&#39; the woman 
mused, opening her eyes and glanced up at the wide, snow-covered dome of 
the circular botanical atrium, &#39;I suppose that I was all too successful 
in my endeavours with that girl...&quot;

Erika sighed heavily, stepping off the little path formed from gray flat 
stones and out onto the soft grassy lawn that separated an expansive 
series of flowerbeds that stretched out in an arching pattern around the 
small wooded area that took up a fair size portion of the volumous 
cylindrical room.

Even with the huge, triple thick glass dome overhead being buried 
beneath Winter&#39;s vengeance, Erika&#39;s garden as she liked to call it, was 
as warm and inviting as any Summer&#39;s day in Celadon. By virtue of the 
array of special lamps that ringed the glass dome, and cleverly hidden 
ventilation and heating systems, the expansive room was maintained at 
constant temperatures throughout the day and night, providing Erika&#39;s 
plethora of plants growing and happy.

Blinking away the glare from the lamps, three stories above her head, 
Erika set off across the expansive grassy field at the center of the 
garden. Upon the ground, sections of the grass had been specially 
hybridized by Erika&#39;s grandMother many years ago to produce a strangely 
pale colour. The nearly white lines of grass blades formed an expansive 
rectangular area in the center of the arboretum, with the intersecting 
lines and circle in the center necessary to have the field declared a 
sanctioned Gym field by the Indigo League.

Though the League had eased up its rules a little, allowing for things 
like personal style, Erika had kept the strange grass growing in memory 
of her ancestor and founder of the Gym she now ran. &#39;But it&#39;s much more 
than that now, though, now isn&#39;t it?&#39; the woman chuckled inwardly, her 
eyes casting over the group of girls who were tending several other 
areas of the garden. 

They were mainly garbed in old denim coveralls and short-sleeved shirts, 
most wearing gardening gloves as they backed up an array of gardening 
tools, pausing in the construction of pond that would, come Spring, be 
the ending point for a long flowing brook that would weave through 
various sections of the arboretum, adding the pleasant and serene sound 
of running water as well as giving Erika a place to add a few new 
aquatic plants she&#39;d had her eye on.

&quot;It&#39;s almost time for lunch, ladies!&quot; came the Orange Islander accented 
tone of a tall woman who had tied her long red hair back and as she 
directed the work on top of doing her own fair share of it, &quot;Let&#39;s hurry 
it up, okay?&quot;

&quot;How is the task progressing, Samantha?&quot; Erika inquired, all but 
appearing silently behind the woman, startling her only slightly as her 
surprised expression slowly became a calm, pleased smile.

&quot;We&#39;re ahead of schedule, actually,&quot; she explained softly, turning to 
face Erika with dark green eyes that mirrored a sense of deep affection 
as her heart thudded a little harder in her chest, &quot;We should be done by 
early March if all goes well.&quot;

Erika nodded slowly, raising her delicately formed upturned hand in 
offering and causing Samantha to blush slightly as she took the woman&#39;s 
soft, warm hand after sliding off her dirt encrusted gloves.

&quot;She&#39;s here again,&quot; the Gym Leader said softly, leading Samantha away 
from the work crew with the usual gliding steps that her apprentice had 
yet to master. 

Samantha kept pace as she took a moment to think her words through, 
years of apprenticing under the often enigmatic beauty that was Erika 
giving her the wisdom to simply not blurt out the first thing that came 
to mind. &quot;A courier has arrived with the next &#39;stone&#39;, I presume,&quot; she 
said slowly, thinking back and reasoning her deductions through before 
adding in her usual teasing tone, &quot;And it&#39;s the same girl as before 
isn&#39;t it? Um... Melinda?&quot;

&quot;Miranda,&quot; corrected Erika with a small, amused smile as she sat down 
upon a comfortable wooden bench that stood before a wide trench dug into 
the fertile soil, making the place where there would one day be a 
flowing brook filled with coy and water lilies as it flowed in a lazy 
half circle through the atrium. 

Samantha nodded as she sat down, feeling a little guilty for being in 
her work clothes as her mentor sat beside her in a handmade silken 
kimono. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I know I shouldn&#39;t tease. But it is somewhat of a 
coincidence that the same courier that delivered that leaf-stone for 
Triffid is the same one delivering one for Audrey. Unless...&quot;

Erika smiled; giggling quietly as her emerald eyes contemplatively 
examined the neatly trimmed blades of grass at her feet for the subtle 
flaws she found so telling. &quot;There are no coincidences in my Gym, oh 
dearest Samantha.&quot;

Her apprentice smiled, chuckling as she shuffled a little closer, but 
refrained from putting an arm around Erika. &quot;Anyway,&quot; the Gym Leader 
continued, sensing the woman&#39;s need and sliding her arm about Samantha&#39;s 
shoulders before leaning her head against the woman&#39;s shoulder, &quot;it 
would seem that I&#39;ve underestimated my own reaction to her renewed 
presence.&quot;

Samantha&#39;s eyes widened, and her heart warmed with the sudden flare of 
jealously she quickly squelched with but one of the emotion calming 
techniques that Erika often taught to her students. &quot;Could it be that 
there is more you wish to teach this one, my Lady?&quot; she inquired, 
keeping her voice level and her tone light with a gentle amusement.

Erika shook her head, her dark, shoulder-length silken locks swaying 
gently as she smiled and glanced up at her apprentice with a gentle, 
affectionate smile. &quot;It does not matter what I want, dearest. It only 
matters what I can have. I&#39;m not about to jeopardize her happiness to 
fulfill my own desires,&quot; she assured, her small hands moving to run her 
gentle fingers across Samantha&#39;s soft skin before holding her 
apprentice&#39;s face lovingly and adding with the barest hint of mischief 
to her tone, &quot;Or Yours... Irregardless, Miranda has found another, and I 
shall not seek to undo all the good that we&#39;ve both done her.&quot;

&quot;My Lady...&quot; breathed Samantha, her body shaking quivering slightly as 
Erika moved her lips so close that the woman&#39;s breath was warm against 
her face as Erika spoke.

&quot;Shhh,&quot; her mentor whispered, giggling quietly to herself as she brushed 
a little earth off Samantha&#39;s cheek, unconcerned as it dirtied her 
fingertips, &quot;You know better.&quot;

&quot;Erika then,&quot; said Samantha with a smile, her lip trembling as her 
mentor closed the gap and placed the lightest of kisses upon her lips, 
barely brushing them yet sending a wave of unstoppable warmth through 
Samantha&#39;s body.

The woman smiled as their lips parted with a quiet sound that seemed to 
echo in their ears. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, my dear. You shall always be my 
favorite. And you I shall always hold a special place in my heart for 
you.&quot;

&quot;My La-&quot; Samantha smiled, blushing as she corrected herself, &quot;Erika. 
Thank you.&quot;

Erika smiled, her eyes casting to one side as the contingent of 
gardeners made their way past, their chorus of chattering voices a 
gentle cacophony to her ears as they all smiled and nodded politely to 
the woman they all owed so much to.

&quot;The Chef will have lunch ready by now,&quot; she said quietly, her voice 
sounding a little distant as Erika turned her attention back to 
Samantha, &quot;You should go. Make sure that our guests have proper 
accommodations and arrange for another Challenge.&quot;

Samantha stammered for a moment before regaining control and nodding. 
&quot;Her significant other wishes to challenge you?&quot; she inquired with a 
sudden grin, standing as Erika&#39;s hands slid down over her shoulders.

The Gym Leader nodded with a secret smile. &quot;She didn&#39;t say it, but I 
could see it in her eyes,&quot; explained Erika, making no move to stand.

Samantha nodded. &quot;As you wish,&quot; she replied politely before tilting her 
head curiously. &quot;Aren&#39;t coming?&quot; the woman inquired, suddenly concerned 
as Erika&#39;s eyes stared out at seeming nothingness.

&quot;I simply need a moment alone, dearest,&quot; came Erika&#39;s whispered reply, 
and Samantha knew better than to argue. Instead, she turned and headed 
for the closest exit with a worried glance over her shoulder at her 
mentor.

Erika waited for the arboretum to become still and quiet but for the 
rustling of leaves and the occasionally murmured call of one of the many 
variety of &quot;awakened&quot; plants she had growing in her garden before 
sighing to herself and smiling contentedly. &quot;What ever shall I do,&quot; she 
mused, her thoughts shifting to distant memories almost of their own 
accord...&quot;
