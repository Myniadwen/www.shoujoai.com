The mood around the round wooden the table was one of celebration as Bob put the 
last steaming platter of food down and took his customary seat between his wife 
Vivian and his almost-brother-in-law Frank. Beside him was Laurna, looking quite 
pleased despite all that had happened, merrily joking with Miranda as Misty once 
again wondered where she&#39;d put the mountain of food her host insisted on piling 
her plate with.

The kitchen itself had been decorated to mark the occasion, with black and 
orange intertwining streamers reaching out to all four corners of the room from 
their center point at the ceiling, and a large glowing Jack O&#39;Lantern still sat 
in the window above the sink, staring out into the darkness despite it being the 
first night of November. 

&quot;So I hear you two are planning on staying on for a month or two,&quot; said Frank 
conversationally; glancing up at Miranda as he shoveled a forkful of Bob&#39;s gravy 
soaked mashed potatoes into his mouth and looking entirely blissful for a 
moment.

His niece nodded. &quot;That&#39;s the plan,&quot; she replied, giving her mother a 
questioning look, &quot;That is, if it&#39;s still alright.&quot;

Vivian chuckled as Bob reached across the table to pass her the gravy he&#39;d spent 
the better part of the day working on. &quot;As though I could refuse such a gift, my 
dear!&quot; the woman responded, meeting her daughter&#39;s gaze with a look that held a 
softness seldom seen in Vivian&#39;s peculiar dark-magenta eyes.

&quot;Hey, maybe you can try out an temporary admin job,&quot; her husband offered in a 
careful tone, glancing from Miranda to Misty to gauge their reactions.

&quot;I think not,&quot; Miranda replied gently, smiling to reassure him before turning to 
her Aunt, &quot;But I was thinking of maybe helping out at the Gym a bit. Earn my 
keep and all that.&quot;

&quot;As if you&#39;d need to!&quot; her mother scolded her mockingly, chuckling at the 
thought of such a thing.

&quot;She&#39;s right!&quot; agreed Misty with a laugh, feeling surprising at ease, and for 
the first time in more than a decade, feeling as though she were truly part of a 
family, &quot;Only Joshua works harder than our Miri!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll second that!&quot; called Frank and Laurna, laughing at each other as they 
raised their glasses high and Miranda blushed as they clinked them against 
Misty&#39;s.

&quot;Oh! And speaking of Joshua,&quot; added Bob as the thought suddenly struck him, 
&quot;He&#39;s retiring this Spring, eh.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?!&quot; exclaimed everyone at the table except for Bob and Vivian.

Bob chuckled to himself, feeling slightly smug. &quot;He&#39;s taking one last big job 
and then he&#39;s coming home to Lavender to stay,&quot; he explained, &quot;Of course, he&#39;s 
not REALLY retiring so much as taking a lighter work load. Joshua&#39;s gonna be one 
of Lavender&#39;s in-city couriers.&quot;

&quot;One of three,&quot; commented Miranda, her eyes fluttering as she realized why her 
Uncle had reacted so favorably to her stepfather&#39;s gravy as she tried a bit of 
the roast he&#39;d made.

&quot;If you don&#39;t mind me asking,&quot; Misty inquired curiously, smiling in Miranda&#39;s 
direction as the courier set her fork down and gripped the table with both hands 
to contain herself, &quot;what&#39;s the big assignment?&quot;

Bob grinned broadly. &quot;It&#39;s a secret,&quot; he replied, dark blue eyes sparkling with 
mirth, &quot;But I can tell you this. It involves the Celadon to Fuchsia Winter 
caravan.&quot;

&quot;Speaking of which!&quot; interrupted Vivian, raising an eyebrow as she inquired of 
her daughter, &quot;Are you up for it this year?&quot;

Miranda opened her eyes, catching her breath as she nodded slowly. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t 
mind,&quot; she assured, glancing at Misty, &quot;If it&#39;s okay with you?&quot;

Misty shrugged, turning to Vivian. &quot;Sure,&quot; she replied, &quot;What&#39;s it involve?&quot;

&quot;Well, it pays quite a bit,&quot; chuckled Bob, receiving a stern glare from his 
wife.

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s quite a hike,&quot; Vivian explained casually, &quot;Especially through the 
mountains when those wretched storms hit us in late January. But you two 
wouldn&#39;t be alone. Joshua&#39;s been the senior courier for that run since as long 
as I&#39;ve been with the Company. He knows the route, and all the complications 
that can arise, so he&#39;ll be in charge. Oh, and they&#39;re be two or three other 
couriers as well. Depending on who&#39;s willing this year.&quot;

&quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind cramped quarters, though,&quot; cautioned Miranda as she 
sipped her tea, &quot;I volunteered my first year as a courier, and I don&#39;t mind 
saying that sleeping in those wagons is something of a talent.&quot;

&quot;Oh, they&#39;re not THAT bad,&quot; her mother replied, shaking her head in dismay as 
she ate.

&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t mind,&quot; assured Misty brightly, &quot;It&#39;d be better than walking through 
nine feet of snow.&quot;

&quot;Hey, I was serious, eh!&quot; said Bob, quickly swallowing a mouthful of vegetables, 
&quot;It pays really well!&quot;

&quot;Well I&#39;m sure Miri&#39;s account can handle a few extra credits,&quot; Misty chuckled.

Vivian sighed, setting her fork down and resting her chin on her hands. &quot;No, 
dear, you misunderstand,&quot; she explained, &quot;We&#39;re offering you a job. A courier 
apprenticeship, actually.&quot; 

&quot;Under Miranda of course,&quot; added Bob hastily, causing Frank to choke a bit on 
his food and Laurna to smack his arm as she giggled.

&quot;I- I don&#39;t know what to say-!&quot; stammered Misty, turning to Miranda who 
carefully took her hand and smiled.

&quot;It&#39;s up to you, dear,&quot; she said, &quot;You can always change your mind later and 
take up another profession if you&#39;d like. But as long as we&#39;re traveling around 
together like this, it gives you an extra reason to be hanging with me.&quot;

&quot;Like I need another one,&quot; assured Misty, squeezing Miranda&#39;s hand as she smiled 
into the courier&#39;s eyes, &quot;but I guess it&#39;d be better than living off my 
inheritance for the rest of my life.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll eat better too!&quot; laughed Bob, &quot;Even apprentice courier&#39;s get fairly good 
wages.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; added Frank with a conspiratory grin, &quot;And you&#39;ll be adding to all those 
old tales you always hear about where apprentices get taken advantage of by 
their mentors!&quot;

&quot;Frank!&quot; Misty laughed, her face blushing profusely as she used her spoon to 
fling several peas across the table at him and Laurna gave him a discerning 
look.

&quot;Hey, wasn&#39;t that what the movie we rented the other night was about?&quot; she 
inquired, trying unsuccessfully to embarrass the Pokeforce Officer.

&quot;That was the pretext!&quot; he chuckled, giving both Miranda and Misty an amused 
wink.

&quot;But seriously,&quot; came Vivian&#39;s calm, yet commanding tone, &quot;Are you willing? For 
the job and the caravan I mean?&quot;

&quot;Um, yes and yes,&quot; Misty replied after a moment&#39;s thought.

Vivian nodded. &quot;Good,&quot; was all she said before going back to her meal.

&quot;Then I&#39;ll be sure to have you both in Celadon come January,&quot; said Bob, &quot;I&#39;m 
sure something&#39;ll come up by then.&quot;

&quot;Hey, yeah!&quot; laughed Misty, &quot;That kinda works, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Oh? How so?&quot; inquired Miranda, suddenly looking a little nervous.

&quot;We can hit the Gym while we&#39;re there,&quot; her lover explained, &quot;Assuming that 
Erika takes challengers that time of year.&quot;

&quot;She does,&quot; assured Laurna, sending her niece a surreptitious glance across the 
table, and receiving a light tap under the table for it, &quot;All year round. 
Erika&#39;s door is always open.&quot;

&quot;And you know,&quot; added Bob, suddenly remembering his promise to his stepdaughter, 
&quot;Angela&#39;s got a run to Cinnabar at about the time you&#39;d be arriving in Fuchsia.&quot;

&quot;Coincidence?&quot; Miranda inquired doubtfully.

&quot;Of course not, dear,&quot; her Mother assured with a Machiavellian grin, &quot;we have 
our reasons for her being there then.&quot;

&quot;Joshua&#39;s secret mission?&quot; inquired Frank, obviously interested in unraveling 
the little mystery.

&quot;I say nothing,&quot; Vivian replied, &quot;But the Dawn Sister II will be in Cinnabar for 
about three days before heading up to Pallet, and you know the trip North to 
Viridian isn&#39;t a long one.&quot;

She then waited for Misty and Frank to end their mutual shudder before 
continuing, Misty for the mention of Pallet Town, and Frank for the mention of 
Viridian City. &quot;Seeing as it&#39;d be so convenient for you, I&#39;m sure Bob can make 
the right arrangements.&quot;

Misty sat back in her chair, goose bumps rising along her arms as her mind 
turned over the possibilities. &quot;Wow, that means I could hit every Gym in less 
than a year,&quot; she breathed still mulling the issue of having to go through 
Pallet.

&quot;It&#39;s up to you,&quot; Vivian said simply, &quot;Oh, and the dinner is beyond excellence, 
dear. Thank you.&quot;

Misty turned to Miranda, not hearing Bob&#39;s words to his wife. &quot;You know,&quot; she 
said quietly, feeling more than a little overwhelmed, &quot;This is a really good 
opportunity.&quot;

Miranda nodded. &quot;It&#39;s good to know you can recognize them,&quot; she teased softly, 
her smile reassuring, &quot;But as my mother says. It&#39;s all up to you.&quot;

&quot;Just think,&quot; Misty chuckled ironically, &quot;I&#39;ll be beating Ash&#39;s time for 
collecting Gym badges. He took two and a half years...&quot;

Miranda&#39;s supportive expression became one of concern as Misty&#39;s eyes became 
suddenly sad. &quot;Are- are you okay?&quot; the courier asked, feeling suddenly guilty as 
she put her arm around Misty and tried to keep the unwelcomed panic from her 
voice.

Misty nodded slowly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, dearest,&quot; she replied quietly, glancing up from 
her plate and into the seemingly endless depths of Miranda&#39;s stormy gray eyes, 
&quot;It&#39;s just that I realized something just now. I- I wasted nearly five years of 
my life with that guy. And what do I have to show for it...?&quot;

&quot;In the end? Self respect,&quot; came Vivian&#39;s answer, her tone uncompromising, but 
maternal nonetheless, &quot;It show&#39;s strength of character to put an end to an 
abusive relationship.&quot;

Misty looked up in time to see Vivian and Laurna exchange glances. &quot;I suppose 
so,&quot; she said quietly, the beginnings of a smile crossing her face, &quot;And um, 
there&#39;s one other thing as well.&quot;

Everyone looked to her as she smiled, her gaze firmly locked on Miranda as she 
put her arm around the courier, leaning in closer as she spoke. &quot;I wound meeting 
and falling in love with the most wonderful woman I could ever imagine,&quot; she 
explained, blushing as everyone else at the table raised their glasses and 
cheered as Misty and Miranda kissed...</pre>
