Miranda took a deep breath as she stood once again in one of the Celadon 
Gym&#39;s tasteful yet still somewhat overdone bathrooms, staring at herself 
in the mirror as she leaned over the sink, cringing as she bent her leg, 
the muscle protesting with a jolt of pain.

&quot;You&#39;d think I&#39;d be used to wandering around this much by now,&quot; Miranda 
muttered, chastising herself as she stood up straight again and tied her 
hair back before slipping the overly warm feeling kimono from her 
shoulders, carefully folding it up and setting it down on the 
countertop. 

&quot;I&#39;ll bet Joshua&#39;d laugh if he heard me complain about it, though,&quot; she 
added with a chuckle, glancing up suddenly as she caught the distant 
seeming sound of Samantha&#39;s laughter in the next room.

Miranda paused for a moment bending her other leg a bit to alleviate the 
ache in her foot before grabbing up a large fluffy white towel and 
wrapping it around herself. &quot;Oh, well,&quot; the courier sighed a little 
nervously, exhaling loudly to blow her dark bangs out of her eyes before 
turning away from her reflection and moving towards the door, &quot;Once more 
into the breach.&quot; 

***

The spacious, comfortable room was lit by several well-placed candles, 
and made slightly warmer than room temperature by the large round 
hot-tub set into the floor. Within it sat Erika and Samantha, sitting 
across from one another talking quietly and looking up as Miranda 
stepped cautiously into the room.

&quot;Feeling any better?&quot; Erika inquired as the courier blushed and took a 
deep breath before closing the door and stepping closer, her eyes 
widening slightly as neither woman made an effort to cover themselves.

&quot;Well, I feel a bit more &#39;normal&#39;,&quot; Miranda replied with a nervous 
chuckle, glancing longingly down at the warm water and the comfortable 
bench just beneath it, &quot;No offence, but I&#39;m used to wearing more 
versatile clothing.&quot;

Her hostess chuckled at the comment, sliding around the tub to sit next 
to Samantha, barely causing the water to ripple as she moved. &quot;It&#39;s 
okay, I understand,&quot; assured Erika, glancing across the clear water 
meaningfully to an unoccupied seat, &quot;but why don&#39;t you join us? The 
water will do you good after walking so much today.&quot;

Miranda nodded slowly, feeling the heat of her cheeks and wishing she 
could just shut off her blush reflex as her heart raced. &#39;I&#39;d almost 
rather wear that silly kimono again,&#39; the courier gulped inwardly, 
glancing over and catching Samantha&#39;s amused, far too knowing gaze, 
&#39;Goodness I hope you&#39;re not psychic!&#39;

&quot;Um, you&#39;re probably right,&quot; the courier said nervously, moving closer 
before dunking her foot down into the warm, inviting water, smiling a 
little as it caressed her skin and sent a pleasant feeling up Miranda&#39;s 
leg.

Erika tried her best not to smile, glancing askance at Samantha to catch 
her gaze as the courier took the second step and stood knee-deep in tub, 
the water lapping gently at the edges of the towel she wore. The redhead 
glanced back at her mentor all too innocently as Erika took Samantha&#39;s 
hand under the water and gave her a slight cautionary look and Miranda&#39;s 
fingers nervously fumbled with the towel, quickly slipping it off before 
sinking swiftly the water.

&quot;You needn&#39;t be self-conscious, deary,&quot; Erika assured, glancing back as 
Miranda sank deeper, leaning forward a bit so that only her neck and 
head remained above the surface, the girl&#39;s arms covering her bosom as 
she smiled back nervously, &quot;We&#39;d never make fun of you.&quot;

&quot;Not that there&#39;s any reason to,&quot; added Samantha, almost succeeding in 
keeping the innuendo from her tone and causing Miranda to give a short 
chuckle at the comment.

&quot;I guess I&#39;ll take my compliment&#39;s where I can get them,&quot; Miranda said 
softly, the water stirring as she reached up to remove her fogging over 
glasses.

&quot;Say, are you near-sighted, or far-sighted?&quot; Samantha inquired, tapping 
her chin thoughtfully with her index finger as the courier set her 
glasses down on the wooden floor.

&quot;Near. Like my Father was,&quot; Miranda replied without thinking as she 
turned back to the two, &quot;I don&#39;t totally need them to see you both at 
this distance, but-&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; said Erika softly as Samantha chuckled at the look upon the 
girl&#39;s face as she tried to duck deeper under the water, &quot;And I&#39;m sorry 
if we&#39;re making you feel uncomfortable.&quot;

Miranda closed her eyes; taking a deep breath she shook her head. &quot;No, 
no,&quot; the girl replied quietly, &quot;It&#39;s just that everything that&#39;s 
happened lately&#39;s been so new to me. Maybe I&#39;m just out of practice when 
it comes to being with people this much.&quot;

&quot;Being a courier must mean you travel alone quite a bit,&quot; inferred 
Erika, leaning back a bit and stretching out her legs, carefully 
watching Miranda&#39;s reaction as her foot slid past hers.

&quot;N, not always,&quot; the girl replied, jumping imperceptivity in surprise at 
the contact, but keeping still nonetheless as she made herself relax, 
&quot;Sometimes we get people who need protection when they travel between 
cities over land. And then there&#39;s the caravans we have, especially 
during the Winter months. Oh, and of course apprentice couriers have to 
travel with their mentors for a while before they&#39;re allowed out on 
their own.&quot;

Erika nodded thoughtfully as her fingers slipped free of Samantha&#39;s, 
touching her hand with a few small movements in order to silently 
communicate her desires as she spoke. &quot;Have you been on your own for 
long?&quot; the woman inquired as Samantha leaned forward, tossing her long 
hair over her head so she could dunk it into the pleasantly warm water.

&quot;Oh, not for too long. Just a few months now,&quot; Miranda replied, her 
stormy gray eyes turning to Samantha as Erika&#39;s apprentice combed out 
her hair with her fingers before dunking her head for a moment, &quot;I&#39;m 
afraid my mentor Joshua wasn&#39;t too happy about my just taking off on 
him, though.&quot;

&quot;What happened exactly?&quot; Erika inquired, her level tone carefully 
neutral as she noted the courier&#39;s distraction, &quot;Have you spoken to him 
since?&quot;

The courier shrugged, relaxing as her mind tried to concentrate on two 
things at once, forgetting her own nakedness for the moment as she 
watched Samantha. &quot;Oh, just the usual stuff,&quot; Miranda muttered quietly, 
watching as Samantha came back up and lifted her hair with both hands 
over her head before letting it go, the movement bringing the rise of 
Samantha&#39;s bosom up above the water level as the woman leaned her head 
back, &quot;I... I just let him get to me, I guess. The way he was telling me 
how to and not to do stuff all the time it... Well, he&#39;s not my Father, 
and I just didn&#39;t like him acting like he was.&quot;

Erika nodded sagely as her apprentice pushed her hair back over her 
ears, smiling softly back at Miranda as the woman settled back down in 
her seat, causing the courier to blush again as she caught herself 
staring. &quot;That&#39;s perfectly understandable,&quot; the Gym Leader replied, her 
fingertips brushing against Samantha&#39;s thigh with new instructions, &quot;I 
just hope you&#39;re not missing out on anything else he could have taught 
you.&quot;

Miranda gave a short, quiet laugh, smiling as she shook her head slowly. 
&quot;No, no,&quot; she assured, staring down at the water between them to where 
the blurry image of the trio&#39;s feet met at the center of the hot-tub, 
&quot;There&#39;s not a lot to being a courier. Learning to be responsible is 
more important than being really good at it. But don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll 
apologize next time I see Joshua, although he&#39;s probably still in 
shock.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Erika inquired at the sudden small smirk that crossed her guest&#39;s 
face.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Miranda chuckled wryly, glancing up at the woman with an amused 
smile, &quot;most Lav&#39;brats are afraid of him. It was probably an unexpected 
shock to his system to have me stand up to him like that, but I&#39;m sure 
Joshua&#39;ll understand. He may not be my dad, but he&#39;s always been 
something of an unofficial Uncle in a way.&quot;

Erika smiled, lightly running her toe partway up Miranda&#39;s calve and 
taking note as the courier inhaled quietly, gently nibbling her bottom 
lip as she watched through the distortion of the water. &quot;He only wanted 
what was best for you,&quot; said Erika softly, staring back intently as 
Miranda&#39;s gaze moved up to catch the look in woman&#39;s eyes, &quot;Just because 
we care for others, doesn&#39;t mean that we all know the best way to 
express our feelings.&quot;

Miranda sighed heavily at that, shaking her head as she leaned back and 
glanced up at the ceiling for a long moment. &quot;If we have any, you mean,&quot; 
she chuckled humourlessly, causing Samantha to glance at her mentor with 
a curiously raised eyebrow.

&quot;You don&#39;t mean Joshua, do you,&quot; stated Erika rhetorically, giving her 
student a short shake of her head and a silent communication upon her 
knee, &quot;You mean Derrick, don&#39;t you.&quot; 

The courier closed her eyes and nodded, her body tensing as she took a 
deep breath and let it out slowly. &#39;Don&#39;t let a stupid memory get the 
better of you, Miri,&#39; she told herself inwardly, reaching for the inner 
strength the courier&#39;d inherited from her Mother, &#39;don&#39;t insult your 
hostess by getting upset, and above all else, don&#39;t let HIM win...&#39;

&quot;I, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Miranda replied at last, bringing her head back down and 
shaking it in dismay, &quot;I&#39;m being childish. I should be more in control 
of my moods by now.&quot;

Erika smiled reassuringly, leaning forward, taking the courier&#39;s hand as 
she chuckled softly. &quot;I doubt that even your Father was completely in 
control of his feelings at your age,&quot; the woman assured, her smile 
somehow infectious.

&quot;You mean my Mother,&quot; Miranda admitted, bowing her head to hide the 
small smile she couldn&#39;t contain as she gave the woman&#39;s hand a small 
squeeze, &quot;My Father was actually kinda impulsive, and he&#39;d even cry when 
watching sappy movies. It&#39;s my mom who&#39;s the really strong one in my 
family. I guess that&#39;s why...&quot;

Erika raised an eyebrow as Miranda&#39;s voice trailed off, the courier 
giving her head a quick shake to unaddle her brain. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Miranda 
said quickly, a rueful chuckle adding a slight edge to her voice, &quot;Too 
much bitterness fighting for precedence today, I guess.&quot;

&quot;You know,&quot; said Erika softly, both her hands holding Miranda&#39;s as she 
held the courier&#39;s gaze, &quot;You&#39;re a beautiful girl, Miri. You shouldn&#39;t 
waste your life on bitterness. It&#39;s not worth it.&quot;

&quot;And neither is he,&quot; the courier agreed, smiling inspite of herself at 
the warm feeling Erika&#39;s words sent through her.

The Gym Leader frowned thoughtfully for a moment before slipping a hand 
out of the water to beckon Miranda closer. &quot;Come here for a moment, 
won&#39;t you?&quot; Erika offered gently, &quot;My questions are bringing up bad 
memories, and I don&#39;t want you to feel all alone over there.&quot;

Miranda gave a small smile at the offer and nodded, allowing herself to 
be pulled to her feet by the hand that held hers before crouching 
self-consciously to cross the distance between them with one arm held 
across her chest.

&quot;It, it&#39;s okay, I guess,&quot; the courier said with a shrug, once more 
allowing herself to be subtly directed to turn around and kneel before 
Erika, the warm water soon lapping at her shoulders as Miranda felt the 
woman&#39;s small, soft hands upon them.

&quot;You mentioned something about your Mother,&quot; the Gym Leader said after a 
moment, her fingers squeezing gently as her eyes widened imperceptivity 
at both the tension she felt in Miranda&#39;s shoulders, but also firmness 
of her muscles, &quot;You sounded... Disappointed.&quot; 

&quot;Well, you know how you... Put people on pedestals?&quot; the courier 
inquired, grimacing a little as her body reacted to the wonderful 
pressure of Erika&#39;s fingers, making note of the woman&#39;s movements for 
future reference, &quot;Well, I guess I kinda did that with both my parents. 
Except that my dad passed away long before he... before he could 
disappoint me.&quot;

&quot;Do you think he would have eventually?&quot; Erika inquired, her thumbs 
sliding up either side of Miranda&#39;s spine along the girl&#39;s neck as she 
spoke.

&quot;I guess so,&quot; Miranda replied quietly, closing her eyes and lifting 
herself up a bit as she leaned her head as far forward as she could, 
holding her ponytail out of the way of her hostess&#39;s fingers, &quot;Most 
people in my life seem to do that eventually.&quot;

&quot;How did she disappoint you?&quot;

Miranda shrugged a little, shivering a bit at the sensation of Erika&#39;s 
fingers pushing their way slowly up the back of her neck before slipping 
lightly down the sides to rub her shoulders once more. &quot;I, I always saw 
her as, I dunno, a pillar of strength, I guess,&quot; the courier responded 
at last, exhaling loudly at the wonderful sensation, &quot;I&#39;ve never seen my 
Mother cry, you know. Not even at the funeral. That&#39;s why... Why when 
she remarried I felt so...&quot;

&quot;Betrayed?&quot; offered Erika to which Miranda shook her head.

&quot;No, more disappointed than anything else,&quot; she replied sadly, lifting 
her head as Erika&#39;s fingers moved down her back, &quot;I guess I just assumed 
that my Mother was strong enough to go it alone forever. That she&#39;d 
never need anyone in her life ever again. But yeah, it did feel to me 
like she was betraying my Father&#39;s memory, like I was the only one who 
still loved him...&quot;

&quot;You weren&#39;t and you aren&#39;t,&quot; said Erika softly, leaning forward to hold 
the girl as her voice broke and Miranda closed her eyes tightly to quell 
her tears, &quot;She still loves him, but no one can stand to be alone 
forever, Miri. Besides, She has a lot of responsibility running the 
Company, she probably needed help.&quot;

Miranda gave a short, quiet, laughing sob, shaking her head in 
pseudo-amusement at the thought. &quot;My Mother admitting to needing help is 
akin to a legendary tale,&quot; she assured with a hint of mirth returning to 
her voice, &quot;As in, you might hear about it happening, but you&#39;ll never 
live long enough to see it happen.&quot;

Both Erika and Samantha smiled at the comment, but kept down their 
laughter as Miranda sat up straighter and leaned back against Erika, the 
woman&#39;s arms moving to hold her more securely, Erika&#39;s hands lying upon 
the courier&#39;s upper arms, holding her reassuringly.

&quot;I shall have to meet her one day,&quot; the Gym Leader replied after a 
moment, amusement evident in her tone, &quot;It&#39;d be interesting to meet one 
of the people who made you who you are today. Perhaps then I wouldn&#39;t 
find you so perplexing, deary.&quot;

Miranda tilted her head a bit before looking back at Erika with a raised 
eyebrow, catching the teasing smile upon the woman&#39;s lips. &quot;I doubt very 
much that there&#39;s a mystery in this world you couldn&#39;t solve,&quot; the 
courier commented seriously, a smile of her own creeping across 
Miranda&#39;s face as she reluctantly slipped out of Erika&#39;s grasp and moved 
to sit beside her, only to have Samantha move to one side and motion for 
her to sit between them.

&quot;Only if they involve nature, or the human heart,&quot; the red haired Orange 
Islander corrected, causing Erika to bow her head slightly, the faintest 
hint of a blush crossing her pale cheeks.

&quot;In that case, do I even have to say anything for you to understand me?&quot; 
inquired Miranda with a chuckle as she sat between the two women, 
blushing as well as Samantha moved closer so that they flanked the 
courier with little room to spare.

&quot;I&#39;m not that good,&quot; Erika replied, glancing meaningfully back at her 
apprentice across Miranda, making the courier feel more a little 
self-conscious, &quot;But I do am a fairly good judge of such things. My 
intuition is seldom wrong.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a talent I could stand to pick up,&quot; Miranda commented with a 
chuckle, &quot;I&#39;d certainly help me be a better judge of character. Maybe 
make my next choice about who I share myself with a bit more of an 
informed one.&quot;

Erika gave a concerned frown at the comment, catching the hint of 
bitterness in the girl&#39;s tone and turning her attention back to Miranda. 
&quot;If you&#39;d be willing to stay a little longer, you&#39;re more than welcome 
to take any number of classes here at my Gym. There is much you could 
learn here.&quot;

Miranda swallowed hard as she felt her self consciousness rising again. 
&quot;Yeah, I, I kinda got that feeling,&quot; she replied with a quiet chuckle.

Erika exchanged a quick half-glance with her apprentice as she turned in 
her seat to face the courier, two of her fingers touching the side of 
Miranda&#39;s chin and gently turning the girl&#39;s head towards her. &quot;That is 
a decision that not I, nor Samantha can make for you, Miri,&quot; Erika said 
softly, her emerald eyes changing subtly, for the briefest heartbeat 
allowing Miranda to see the desire behind them before taking on the more 
guarded calmness that usually inhabited their seemingly endless depths.

The courier closed her eyes for a moment, inhaling deeply before letting 
her breath out slowly. &quot;You... you were serious earlier, weren&#39;t you?&quot; 
Miranda said softly, opening her eyes and bowing her head a bit as 
stared back up at Erika, her tone nervous, but unafraid.

Erika smiled reassuringly her fingers brushing along Miranda&#39;s soft 
cheek. &quot;It&#39;s up to you, deary,&quot; she replied gently, &quot;It is true that 
both Samantha and I would deeply enjoy spending a night with you. To 
have you share our bed, and to show you how wonderful lovemaking can be 
when it&#39;s free of truly selfish intent. But neither of us will be 
offended if you decline, Miranda, nor will I withdraw my hospitality. 
It&#39;s completely up to you.&quot;

The courier turned away for a moment, her heart racing as she stared 
down at the water contemplatively. &quot;I, I think I&#39;d like that,&quot; Miranda 
said softly, immediately covering her face with both hands, shaking her 
head as she suddenly laughed, &quot;I can&#39;t believe I just said that!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, deary,&quot; said Erika softly, her hand upon Miranda&#39;s 
shoulder, &quot;nothing you say to us will ever leave this room. And if you 
feel the need to leave, we won&#39;t stop you. I shall not sacrifice a 
friendship to gain a lover.&quot;

Miranda took a deep breath to steady her nerves, half-certain that Erika 
could hear her heart pounding in her chest, wishing she could stop 
blushing. &quot;I, I&#39;m not going anywhere,&quot; Miranda said at last, her hands 
slipping back under the water as she sat up straighter and looked back 
at her hostess, the girl&#39;s voice shaking a bit as she spoke, Miranda&#39;s 
demeanor in sharp contrast to the complete calm that wrapped itself 
around Erika like a second skin.

Erika nodded slowly, her smile approving as she took Miranda&#39;s hand and 
slowly stood, bringing them both to their feet, the cooler air causing 
them both to shiver for a bit. &quot;Well then, I believe that I speak for 
both of us when I say that I&#39;m glad for that,&quot; the Gym Leader replied, 
at last smiling and giving a soft sigh of contentment as Samantha draped 
a towel about Erika&#39;s shoulders.

&quot;Indubitably, my Lady,&quot; her apprentice chuckled, casting a mischievous 
glance over Miranda&#39;s shoulder as she placed a second towel upon the 
courier&#39;s shoulders.

Erika&#39;s smile changed slightly as she caught the teasing sarcasm in her 
apprentice&#39;s voice, her hands slipped free of Miranda&#39;s before pulling 
the towel from her shoulders and giving Samantha a small nod.

&quot;This may sound a bit strange to your ears, deary,&quot; said Erika softly, 
placing her towel against Miranda&#39;s chest, leaning closer as she spoke, 
&quot;But everything I&#39;ve done during your stay here is as much for my own 
sense of hospitality, as it is for your sense of well-being. You could 
almost say that you&#39;ve been one of my students in a way.&quot;

Miranda inhaled deeply as the woman&#39;s hands slowly moved downwards, 
dragging the towel against her wet skin, pausing as they reached the 
girl&#39;s breasts. &quot;How- How so?&quot; the courier stammered, her hands shaking 
a little as Miranda internally debated whether or not it was okay to 
touch the woman in return.

Erika smiled, her emerald eyes mirroring a certain fondness as her hands 
squeezed gently through the towel, causing Miranda to let out a 
surprised gasp that sent a pleasant tingle down the woman&#39;s spine. 
&quot;Well,&quot; the gym leader said thoughtfully, tilting her head to one side, 
glancing back at Samantha as her apprentice began drying Miranda&#39;s back, 
&quot;It is my goal that you should learn a few important things while you&#39;re 
here.&quot;

&quot;Besides this?&quot; the courier inquired with a sheepish grin, bowing her 
head slightly as she looked up at Erika through her bangs, catching her 
breath as the woman&#39;s hands dragged the towel lower, exposing Miranda&#39;s 
small, firm breasts to the open air once more.

&quot;This is only part of it, my dear,&quot; Erika chuckled, catching the look in 
Miranda&#39;s eyes as Samantha pushed the towel down over her bottom, giving 
it a teasing squeeze as she knelt behind the courier, &quot;Perhaps its 
selfish of me, but I wanted you to experience this without pretense. To 
make love with someone who isn&#39;t just looking to further their own 
career, but instead just wants you to be happy.&quot;

&quot;To wash away the bitterness,&quot; added Samantha, standing once again 
before suddenly pressing her lips against Miranda&#39;s earlobe as the 
courier lost herself in all the attention, &quot;To make you feel wanted, and 
needed for you and who you are, not just what you have to give.&quot;

&quot;I... I don&#39;t have much -to- give,&quot; Miranda replied with a small shiver, 
closing her eyes and tilting her head away from Samantha&#39;s lips, 
exposing her neck as she felt Erika&#39;s hands move down her legs.

&quot;Oh, I beg to differ,&quot; Samantha chuckled, dropping the towel into the 
water as her arms wrapped around the girl, her hands sliding across 
Miranda&#39;s soft skin as Samantha&#39;s own still wet body pressed against the 
courier&#39;s back, &quot;Actually, I&#39;d say you have much to offer, assuming 
you&#39;re willing to share that is.&quot;

Miranda blushed at the woman&#39;s comment, opening her eyes and holding her 
breath in anticipation as Erika&#39;s hands slid down the courier&#39;s legs, 
the Gym Leader&#39;s lips delivering a slow line of lingering, affectionate 
kisses downward from Miranda&#39;s navel.

&quot;I- I don&#39;t think I could refuse, even if I wanted to,&quot; the courier 
replied with a bit of a chuckle, shivering suddenly as she felt 
Samantha&#39;s parted lips run up the side of her neck before the woman&#39;s 
teeth gently nibbled her ear.

Samantha made a thoughtful sound as she dragged her teeth back, 
releasing Miranda&#39;s earlobe as her hands moved up the girl&#39;s chest, her 
fingertips lightly touching the courier&#39;s breasts. &quot;Oh, I think we&#39;d 
have to insist on your refusal if you did have an objection.&quot;

Miranda could only nod, her body tensing as Erika settled into a 
reasonably comfortable kneeling position, the woman&#39;s hands sliding 
fondly over the firmness of Miranda&#39;s leg muscles.

&quot;Being a courier agrees with you, deary,&quot; the woman chuckled teasingly, 
her hands sliding up and back around to give Miranda&#39;s bottom a squeeze 
as though to confirm her suspicions, &quot;It&#39;s rare to find someone as 
beautiful on the outside as she is on the inside.&quot;

Before Miranda could respond, the tip of Erika&#39;s tongue touched her 
skin, running ever downwards, moving so close to Miranda&#39;s clit that the 
sensation nearly caused the girl to topple over if not for Samantha&#39;s 
support. Erika smiled inwardly at the reaction; the soft gasps that 
escaped Miranda&#39;s lips seemingly musical to her ears as she ran her 
tongue in a slow circle around the small nub before moving downwards 
again.

&quot;She tends to tease a bit when she finds something she likes,&quot; whispered 
Samantha softly, her own tongue running lightly over Miranda&#39;s earlobe 
as she gently fondled the courier&#39;s breasts, her fingers holding 
Miranda&#39;s nipples between them, squeezing just enough to get the girl&#39;s 
attention.

&quot;Th-that&#39;s okay,&quot; Miranda stammered, blushing as she felt her knees 
threaten to give out.

Erika glanced up and smiled at the comment, giving the girl&#39;s clit a 
small, delicate kiss, causing the courier to let out a muffled 
exclamation and grab Erika&#39;s shoulders in an attempt to stay standing. 

&quot;This is quite new to you, isn&#39;t it?&quot; the gym leader said softly, her 
hands moving slowly upwards along Miranda&#39;s thighs.

&quot;Quite,&quot; Miranda agreed with a small laugh, her body shaking as she 
leaned back against Samantha, tilting her head to one side as the 
courier felt the woman&#39;s lips touch her neck again, sliding along 
Miranda&#39;s skin so lightly it made her shiver.

&quot;Such a shame, yet such a gift,&quot; Erika murmured, her lips brushing 
against the skin of Miranda&#39;s thigh as both her hands slid slowly 
around, the woman&#39;s fingers transposing themselves between Samantha and 
Miranda&#39;s bottom, &quot;I only hope that we are worthy.&quot;

For her part, Miranda could only close her eyes tightly, trying to gasp 
out a reply as Erika&#39;s fingers squeezed her bottom fondly at the same 
time as Samantha&#39;s teeth gently nibbled her earlobe. With shaking hands, 
Miranda brought her fingers into Erika&#39;s hair; the soft silkiness of the 
woman&#39;s dark locks surprising Miranda, so used to tangles of her own 
hair.

The courier was quickly distracted once more, though, as the tip of 
Erika&#39;s tongue suddenly touched her womanhood, pressing against her 
labia so gently, almost reverently that Miranda barely felt it. The girl 
still reacted, however, standing taller upon her toes as her whole body 
tensed up, holding her breath for a moment before slowly exhaling as 
Erika waited for Miranda to calm back down.

&quot;You okay?&quot; Samantha chuckled, nuzzling Miranda&#39;s neck affectionately, 
smiling as the courier barely found the strength to nod.

&quot;Perhaps it would be better to do this elsewhere,&quot; added Erika 
wistfully, &quot;somewhere more, appropriate?&quot;

&quot;Well, I am having trouble standing,&quot; Miranda confessed with a quiet 
nervous laugh.

&quot;Oh, I suppose, you&#39;re right,&quot; agreed Samantha with a hint of 
disappointment in her voice, smiling at the girl&#39;s reaction as she gave 
Miranda&#39;s nipples a playful squeeze before releasing the courier&#39;s 
breasts entirely.

&quot;Good, then its settled, then,&quot; said Erika with a slow, thoughtful nod 
as she stood once more, taking her towel and wrapping it more securely 
about herself as Samantha moved to acquire Miranda a new one, &quot;Assuming, 
that is, that you&#39;d like to continue with this?&quot;

Miranda blushed as she bowed her head, hiding behind her bangs as 
Samantha secured the second warm, fluffy towel about her. &quot;How could I 
say no?&quot; the girl inquired rhetorically, smiling shyly up at Erika, 
gasping softly as she felt Samantha&#39;s lips brush lightly against her 
neck.

Erika chuckled lightly, giving a small nod as she turned away, barely 
disturbing the water as she lifted herself form it. &quot;Just remember, 
deary,&quot; the woman cautioned, the seriousness of her tone made light by 
the Erika&#39;s trademark contemplativeness, &quot;it&#39;s always an option.&quot; 

The courier could only smile as she felt Samantha&#39;s arm wrap around her 
shoulder, guiding her along behind Erika, leading Miranda from the hot 
tub and back into the gym leader&#39;s well-appointed bedroom. As her bare 
feet touched the plush, carpeting, the courier smiled appreciatively. 
Though Erika could have afforded to live in opulence, her tastes were 
simple while still being aesthetically pleasing. 

The room was only slightly larger than the one Miranda had at home, with 
a large second floor bay window overlooking the now dark street and the 
front gardens of the Gym&#39;s neighbors. Erika&#39;s canopy bed sat between it 
and the dressing table, with paintings of sunsets over untouched 
landscapes decorating the wall across from it. The room itself, normally 
lit by a pair of antique lamps on either side of the bed, was now lit by 
several flickering candles, lending an air of surreality to the 
situation. 

Miranda couldn&#39;t help but smile as she glanced about, surreptitiously 
shuffling her feet slightly to dry the remaining moisture from them 
before moving fully into the room. &quot;Were you planning this all along?&quot; 
the courier inquired quietly, feeling heat upon her cheeks once more and 
desperately hoping it didn&#39;t make look too silly.

Erika let out the beginning of a small chuckle, which she quickly 
stifled as she went to the dressing table and pulled out the chair. &quot;The 
answer to your question is neither yes, nor no, dear courier,&quot; the woman 
assured her with a mysterious smile, their eyes meeting across the room 
by their reflections in the mirror, &quot;It was my intention to spend the 
evening here with Samantha, irregardless of your decision. I am pleased, 
though, that you still haven&#39;t chosen to flee our presence.&quot;

&quot;The door&#39;s not locked,&quot; whispered Samantha, her lips suddenly pressed 
against the courier&#39;s ear, causing Miranda to blush more deeply, her 
skin tingling at the contact of the redhead&#39;s lips against her lobe, &quot;We 
won&#39;t force you to stay, but we both very much want you to.&quot;

Miranda just nodded, smiling as she let Samantha guide her over to the 
dressing table. When at last she found herself sitting down in the 
comfortable antique chair, Miranda glanced up into the mirror once more 
and smiled shyly at her hostess.

&quot;If there&#39;s anything else we can do to make you more comfortable, deary, 
be sure just to say it,&quot; came Erika&#39;s soft tone, her small hand picking 
up a silver handled hairbrush as the fingers of her other hand slipped 
under the damp mass of Miranda&#39;s hair, made heavy by the water that 
still clung to it.

&quot;No, no, I&#39;m fine,&quot; the girl assured, jumping a little and glancing 
towards the door in alarm as a polite knock caught her off guard. 

Samantha gave a small chuckle at the reaction, glancing over her 
shoulder at the courier and smiling as she moved to the door. As the 
apprentice pulled it open, Miranda&#39;s stormy gray eyes went wide and a 
small shiver ran down her spine, the chill she felt warmed by the 
reassuring touch of Erika&#39;s soft hands upon her shoulders.

Standing in the doorway, holding a tray laden with a decorative teapot 
and cups was the blond girl in the blue kimono. Erika and Samantha 
exchanged a few quiet words as Erika&#39;s careful hands began combing out 
the wet tangles of Miranda&#39;s hair, the woman&#39;s skillful movements 
somehow unwinding the matted maze of deep ebony without yanking a single 
hair from Miranda&#39;s head.

&quot;Sorry it&#39;s so late,&quot; commented Samantha with a shrug, grinning in 
amusement as she turned towards the two, sliding the door closed with 
her foot before walking over and setting the tray down upon the table, 
&quot;we&#39;re a bit short handed this evening.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s little point in making excuses, dearest,&quot; said Erika sagely, 
her mysterious emerald eyes glancing askance at her apprentice, &quot;things 
simply are as they are. An excuse won&#39;t change the truth.&quot;

Samantha nodded thoughtfully, pouring out steaming tea for each of them. 
&quot;I guess I still have more to learn from you after all,&quot; she replied 
teasingly, making Miranda chuckle as she looked up at Erika in 
amazement, the woman&#39;s comb running through the courier&#39;s hair far 
easier than seemed possible.

&quot;There&#39;s always something more to learn,&quot; the Gym Leader agreed as 
Miranda accepted a steaming cup from Samantha with a thankful smile, &quot;We 
need only be receptive to life&#39;s teachings.&quot;

Miranda closed her eyes for a moment, taking a sip of the bitter tea and 
sighing heavily as its warmth spread through her, calming the girl as 
she listened to Erika and her apprentice, their philosophical 
conversation a quiet murmur in comparison to the wonderful feeling of 
the woman&#39;s hands in her hair. 

&#39;I could almost get used to this,&#39; Miranda mused, the happy thought 
suddenly being tainted by a bitter memory of her former lover. &#39;Derrick 
never bothered with my hair,&#39; she thought with a frown, &#39;Said the 
tangles were to difficult to deal with...&#39;

&quot;Are you okay, deary?&quot; came Erika&#39;s quite voice as Miranda finally 
noticed the sudden silence in the room and felt the warm arms that held 
her from behind, &quot;You seem troubled.&quot;

Miranda opened her eyes and caught Erika&#39;s gaze in the mirror. Though 
she knew that she needn&#39;t say a word, the girl nodded slowly, relaxing 
the frown that had crept across her face. &quot;Just bad memories,&quot; the 
courier replied softly, doing her best to smile.

&quot;That&#39;s why you&#39;re here, though,&quot; the woman said softly, giving Miranda 
a reassuring hug, &quot;To let go of all of that.&quot;

Miranda bowed her head, giving a small chuckle. &quot;Do you always try and 
improve the lives of the couriers who show up on your doorstep?&quot; she 
inquired, her heart sinking a little as she felt Erika&#39;s arms released 
her.

&quot;Only those whose pain reflects so darkly in their eyes,&quot; the woman 
replied, her hands resting upon Miranda&#39;s shoulders, gently squeezing 
them as Miranda&#39;s muscles tensed.

&quot;I guess I&#39;m not as much like my Mother as I&#39;d thought I was,&quot; she 
replied ruefully, shaking her head slowly, &quot;As I&#39;ve said, I&#39;ve never 
seen her cry. No one has... I wish I could be as strong as her.&quot;

&quot;Holding back tears has nothing to do with strength,&quot; Erika said softly, 
causing Miranda&#39;s muscles to flinch, the courier biting back a comment, 
&quot;Your Mother has her own reasons for doing so. Never having met her, I 
can only make sweeping assumptions. All that I can tell you, Miranda, is 
that you don&#39;t have to be like your Mother or your Father. You are a 
combination of the best of both of them, and I doubt very much that 
either of them would be disappointed in you now.&quot;

Miranda let out a short laugh, setting down her tea and leaning back 
against the chair with her head resting against Erika&#39;s warm body, the 
courier&#39;s eyes held closed as she tried to center her scattered 
thoughts, the girl&#39;s voice lowering slowly as she spoke. &quot;She told me to 
stay away from Derrick, you know,&quot; she explained sadly, &quot;But I didn&#39;t 
listen. And then I refused to listen to my mentor Joshua. I&#39;m afraid our 
argument wasn&#39;t as simple as I said it was... I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll ever 
forgive me for what I said to him...&quot;

&quot;Just because he&#39;s ancient, doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s forgotten what it&#39;s like 
to be young,&quot; the Gym Leader assured, her arms slipping around Miranda 
once more, holding her gently as a tear rolled down the courier&#39;s cheek, 
&quot;I&#39;m sure that Joshua will understand if you apologize to him. He knows 
you haven&#39;t had the best of luck with men, and he wouldn&#39;t have taken 
you on as an apprentice if he didn&#39;t care about you.&quot;

Miranda nodded slowly. &quot;He never takes on apprentices, you know,&quot; she 
said softly, taking a deep breath before continuing, &quot;Joshua always said 
they just slowed him down...&quot; the courier let out a small chuckle, 
suddenly smiling inspite of herself, &quot;...He&#39;s what? In his seventies or 
something crazy like that, and he&#39;s concerned about the newbie couriers 
slowing -him- down?!&quot;

Miranda opened her eyes once more and looked up at Erika, wiping her 
eyes with the back of her hand as the woman smiled back. &quot;You have a lot 
of people who care about you, Miri,&quot; the Gym Leader assured, her arms 
releasing the girl and taking a step back, &quot;You&#39;re a wonderful person, 
and I doubt very much that anyone truly worthy of your love would 
willingly abandon you.&quot;

Miranda winced again, glancing away as she took another quick deep sip 
of her tea, shaking a bit as she forced the hot liquid down her throat. 
&quot;Derrick,&quot; she replied hesitantly, wishing she could just calm herself 
completely and accept the gift she knew Erika was still offering, &quot;He... 
Are you saying he was &#39;unworthy&#39;? That, well, it sounds a bit 
self-important to think of someone as being unworthy of me...&quot;

Erika shook her head slowly, smiling sagely. &quot;The truth is still the 
truth,&quot; she replied, &quot;no matter how we express it, no matter the words 
we choose, the fact remains the same. I could tell you that he simply 
wasn&#39;t right for you. Or that he simply wasn&#39;t the vessel that held the 
other half of your soul. But the simple truth is, Miranda Lilcamp, that 
he was unworthy of you. Now you have to accept that you made a mistake, 
and move on from it. Don&#39;t let it rule you. Don&#39;t let his heartlessness 
win in the end.&quot;

Miranda closed her eyes tightly, standing as she turned and held out her 
arms, signing heavily as she immediately felt Erika&#39;s body pressed 
against her own, the woman&#39;s, holding the courier more reassuringly than 
anyone ever had before.

&quot;I won&#39;t,&quot; Miranda promised softly, returning the embrace, her head 
resting upon Erika&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Just one thing...&quot;

&quot;Just name it,&quot; responded Erika, her voice seemingly carried upon a 
gentle Summer&#39;s breeze as the woman&#39;s fingers idly ran through Miranda&#39;s 
once more tangle free hair.

&quot;Make love to me,&quot; the courier replied, her voice so quiet that she 
barely heard it herself, Miranda&#39;s embarrassment at the request causing 
her body to shake and her face to warm the bare skin of Erika&#39;s 
shoulder.

Erika&#39;s soft kiss upon her neck a moment later then caused the courier&#39;s 
body to shiver from the unaccustomed sensation. &quot;I would love to, Miri,&quot; 
the Gym Leader responded sincerely, her fingers slipping through 
Miranda&#39;s hair to hold the back of her head affectionately, &quot;And if you 
want, I shall ask Samantha to leave us for now.&quot;

&quot;No, no,&quot; Miranda said a little louder than she would have liked, 
blushing at the eagerness in her voice, envying Erika&#39;s calmness and 
inner serenity once again, &quot;It, it might be interesting to try. 
Besides... Then you guys can teach me things. Things you probably don&#39;t 
teach to all of your students...&quot;

Erika chuckled softly, giving Miranda a firmer squeeze in her amusement. 
&quot;I&#39;m afraid that even I don&#39;t have that kind of energy, my dear,&quot; the 
woman assured, &quot;Besides, contrary to what you may think, not all of my 
students are inclined in this fashion. Nor could they all benefit from 
this.&quot;

Miranda nodded thoughtfully, lifting her head slowly to look into 
Erika&#39;s mysterious green eyes. &quot;Do you... Do you actually &#39;want&#39; me?&quot; 
the girl inquired hesitantly, stumbling on the words, but needing to 
know, nonetheless, &quot;Or is this just help me?&quot;

Erika&#39;s smile gave away little in response, but the suddenly unveiled 
desire in her eyes gave at least part of the answer before hiding once 
more behind the veil of emerald green. &quot;Yes,&quot; was Erika&#39;s only verbal 
response before holding the sides of Miranda&#39;s face and standing a 
little taller to make up for the height difference before pressing her 
lips gently against the courier&#39;s.

Miranda&#39;s muscles released their tension as she felt herself kiss back, 
her hands holding onto Erika&#39;s shoulders for support. For what felt like 
a wondrous eternity Erika barely moved, simply letting Miranda become 
used to the sensation as her heart beat faster in her chest. Once the 
courier remembered to breath, she pulled back ever so slightly and gave 
Erika several small kisses, the woman&#39;s lips responsive and yielding 
without being demanding or insistent, allowing Miranda to experiment for 
the moment. 

When at last Miranda opened her eyes, her body shaking as she stared 
breathlessly back at Erika with flushed cheeks and an embarrassed smile, 
the woman slowly opened her eyes and gave Miranda an approving smile. 
&quot;We have as long as you need,&quot; said Erika softly, her hands sliding back 
to run her fingers through Miranda&#39;s hair once more, &quot;Be it all this 
night, or be it all of several. I want this to be a new first time for 
you, Miri. I want to show you how wonderful this can be when it&#39;s done 
without selfish pretence.&quot;

The courier closed her eyes once more, leaning her head back and moaning 
softly as she felt Erika&#39;s soft lips caress the curve of her neck, 
Miranda&#39;s fingers curling as she tried to contain the sensation that 
filled her. As Erika&#39;s lips began kissing their way lower, crossing the 
naked skin above the towel Miranda wore, her hands slid down the 
courier&#39;s back, the woman&#39;s fingertips gently pressing against her 
spine, running down along either side of it before teasingly coming 
around to rest upon Miranda&#39;s hips.

Miranda tensed once more, swallowing hard as she looked down at Erika, 
the woman&#39;s hands on the move again, coming up the front of Miranda&#39;s 
towel to rest her fingertips gently against the courier&#39;s bosom. Their 
eyes then meeting as Erika&#39;s fingers slid forward, her hands soon 
cupping Miranda&#39;s breasts gently, giving them a slight, gentle squeeze, 
the woman smiling as the courier inhaled sharply. 

&quot;You&#39;ve nothing to worry about, Miri,&quot; whispered Erika, her smile 
widening as Miranda stood a little taller at the feeling of Samantha&#39;s 
fingers undoing the simple wrapping of her towel from behind, &quot;they&#39;re 
as perfect as anyone&#39;s, and will no doubt be the envy of any woman who 
should ever see them.&quot;

&quot;Wha- what?&quot; the courier stammered hesitantly, a nervous smile crossing 
her lips as her cheeks flushed once more.

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Erika said softly, giving the girl&#39;s chin a teasing kiss as 
the towel parted in the back, leaving only a tenuous barrier between the 
Gym Leader&#39;s hands and Miranda&#39;s bosom, &quot;you needn&#39;t be insecure about 
your body.&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; came Samantha&#39;s agreement, ending any kind of an argument with 
the feeling of the tip of her tongue running along the curve of 
Miranda&#39;s earlobe, &quot;infact, I&#39;m surprised you&#39;re not fending guys off 
with that sword of yours.&quot;

&quot;I- I wish I could say that&#39;s what it&#39;s for,&quot; the courier giggled in 
reply, tilting her head to one side, her body tensing as she tried not 
to die from embarrassment, realizing then that the towel was held 
against her body solely by Erika&#39;s hands upon her breasts.

Erika smiled in amusement at the attempt at humor, her hands smoothing 
out the fluffy towel, conforming it to the shape of Miranda&#39;s small firm 
bosom before catching the girl&#39;s nipples between her fingers. &quot;It&#39;s so 
often the ones who are under-appreciated who have the most to offer,&quot; 
the Gym Leader mused, smiling as Miranda inhaled sharply again, her body 
quivering beneath Erika&#39;s touch.

When at last she could breath normally again, Miranda looked downward in 
time to see Samantha&#39;s hands sliding around her torso, her fingers 
resting just beneath the courier&#39;s bosom as Erika&#39;s hands moved back, 
the woman&#39;s fingers drawing the towel back with them. Miranda could then 
only hold her breath, nibbling her bottom lip as the cooler air touched 
her naked skin, and Samantha&#39;s hands moved upwards, her fingers slowly 
sliding over the rise of her bosom to take a gentle hold of Miranda&#39;s 
breasts.

Erika smiled as the girl closed her eyes tightly, her breathing 
quickening as Miranda&#39;s body shivered almost inperceptively. &quot;Just say 
the word, and we&#39;ll stop, deary,&quot; the Gym Leader whispered, her hands 
joining her apprentice&#39;s, completely covering the courier&#39;s breasts for 
the moment.

Miranda, though, just shook her head, not trusting herself to speak, 
half-fearful of making a scene in front of the two, and silently begging 
for them not to stop. She got her wish a moment later as Erika&#39;s hands 
slipped off of Samantha&#39;s, instead taking Miranda&#39;s hands and leading 
her backwards towards the bed.

Samantha gave a small sound of protest as Miranda stepped obediently 
forward, pouting cutely at her mentor before a wide grin crossed her 
face at the look in Erika&#39;s eyes. The redhead simply letting her hands 
slip slowly away from the girl&#39;s breasts, her fingers giving Miranda&#39;s 
nipples a gentle squeeze before letting them go and stepping past her to 
stand beside Erika.

Miranda opened her eyes as she heard the mattress of Erika&#39;s bed move 
and a momentary look of amusement crossed her face as the courier saw 
both Erika and Samantha sitting at the edge of the bed smiling up at 
her. Without a word, Erika released one of the courier&#39;s hands, which 
was quickly taken by Samantha before the two pulled the girl gently 
closer.

Miranda let out a surprised gasp as she stepped closer, and suddenly 
felt both their lips upon her breasts, each of them taking one of the 
courier&#39;s nipples and suckling it gently. Once she&#39;d remembered to 
breath again, Miranda&#39;s leaned forward, one hand on each of her lover&#39;s 
shoulders, her body shaking from the unaccustomed sensation. 

As both women&#39;s hands came up to caress Miranda&#39;s naked skin, running in 
seemingly random patterns across her body as their teeth ran teasingly 
across the hard nubs of the courier&#39;s nipples, their mouths suckled 
firmly, taking in a portion of Miranda&#39;s breasts at the same time. It 
soon became all that Miranda could do just to remain standing as she her 
breathing became panting, and the girl tried to stifle the whimpering 
moan she felt building in her throat. As her knees began to give out, 
Miranda&#39;s hands slipped up behind Erika and Samantha&#39;s heads, her 
fingers sliding through their hair to pull them closer to her bosom, the 
curious sensation causing the courier&#39;s body to shake.

&quot;I- Oh wow-!&quot; was all that the girl could muster, her voice continually 
catching in her throat as Miranda tried desperately not to embarrass 
herself, but couldn&#39;t deny the building ecstasy she felt. 

Despite the simplicity of the act, there was simply something intensely 
pleasurable about the sensation of having both her nipples suckled at 
once. Something about the act that was both perverse and comforting at 
the same time, and as Miranda felt fingers sliding cautiously along her 
inner thighs up towards her womanhood, the courier tensed, knowing that 
she wouldn&#39;t be able to contain herself if they were to touch her there.

It was then that another small memory returned to her, one that made the 
girl smile to herself, grinning broadly as her fingers curled, taking up 
twin handfuls of still damp, yet soft hair. &#39;He barely touched them,&#39; 
Miranda thought inwardly, giggling inspite of herself, &#39;Not once did 
Derrick pay more than passing attention to my breasts... Ha! It&#39;s his 
loss!&#39;

Erika opened her eyes curiously as she heard the courier&#39;s sudden 
laugher, but moaned happily as she felt her head being pulled closer, 
the woman&#39;s tongue making slow circles around the nipple she suckled. 
Glancing over at Samantha with half-lidded eyes, the Gym Leader smiled 
inwardly as her apprentice pulled back, panting as her fingers brushed 
against Miranda&#39;s labia.

&quot;Is that alright?&quot; she inquired breathlessly, despite the feel of warm 
moisture she felt between the pouting outer lips. 

Miranda&#39;s head rolled back around, the courier smiling euphorically down 
at the two as the tip of Samantha&#39;s middle finger ran along the line 
between her labia, collecting moisture and driving her slowly crazy. 
&quot;What&#39;ll be not alright is if you stop!&quot; the courier laughed, receiving 
a wide grin from Samantha whose finger pushed a little deeper, the end 
of the digit becoming enveloped by the Miranda&#39;s warm wetness as the 
girl caught her breath.

Samantha smiled to herself as she watched the courier&#39;s eyes become 
unfocused, her panting deeper as the redhead&#39;s finger moved slowly back 
and forth, waiting for Miranda&#39;s wetness to allow it to move further. 
&quot;Just making sure,&quot; the woman said with a wink before leaning forward 
again, her lips closing about Miranda&#39;s breast as her tongue assaulted 
the girl&#39;s nipple.

Miranda closed her eyes tightly, focusing on trying to remember to 
breath as she felt Samantha&#39;s finger change from simple sliding back and 
forth, to pushing upwards before pulling back and moving up once again. 
It was then that Miranda felt a second hand upon her womanhood, the 
fingertips gently resting against her skin as one of them suddenly 
touched her clit with a touch so light that the courier barely felt it.

Miranda forced her eyes open just enough to see and immediately blushed 
at the look she saw in Erika&#39;s eyes, knowing full well that the woman 
was enjoying the look upon her face. With the greatest of effort, the 
courier nodded slowly, biting her bottom lip as her body shuddered with 
need.

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid to let go,&quot; Erika soothed, her finger making small 
rotations against Miranda&#39;s clit, &quot;There&#39;s no need to hold back.&quot;

The courier closed her eyes again, inhaling sharply through her teeth to 
stifle the quiet whimper of desire that escaped her lips, the warm 
softness of Erika&#39;s finger against her clit making the girl want to 
scream. For what felt like forever, the slow motions of Erika&#39;s finger 
seemed to move in sync with the finger that was slowly sliding in and 
out of Miranda. 

When she suddenly felt the suckling mouths upon her nipples depart, 
leaving her breasts with a sudden chill, Miranda opened her eyes and 
gave her two lovers a pleading look. They both simply smiled in reply as 
their fingers slipped away, causing Miranda&#39;s body to give a sudden 
shudder as they got to their feet.

&quot;You should lay down,&quot; murmured Erika, her hand touching the side of 
Miranda&#39;s face fondly as she spoke, giving the girl a small kiss upon 
the lips before slowly turning them both around, &quot;Your knees shouldn&#39;t 
suffer for your pleasure.&quot;

Miranda simply nodded, her skin seeming to tingle as she sat back down 
on the canopied bed and crawled back a bit before lying down upon it. 
The courier then looked up at Erika and Samantha with a small, shy smile 
and swallowed down her nervousness as the two dropped their towels 
before coming towards her.

As one, the two lovers crept slowly up the bed, their hands sliding 
along either side of Miranda&#39;s legs as they left slow trails of kisses 
along her skin. The courier watched for a moment until the look of 
desire in Erika and Samantha&#39;s eyes became too much for her, and the 
girl had to drop her head back down to stare upwards at the creeping ivy 
patterns of the canopy ceiling. 

Miranda soon felt the warmth of two bodies pressing against the sides of 
her legs as hands slid up her inner thighs, causing her fingers to curl 
up, taking twin handfuls of the quilt she was lying upon. &#39;This is just 
too much!&#39; Miranda mused inwardly, smiling widely as she arched her back 
and did her best to move her legs further apart, receiving appreciative 
sounds for her trouble.

It was then that Miranda felt a warm wetness upon her labia, the 
sensation of two tongues sliding upwards along them, occasionally 
meeting in the middle and moving back downwards before touching her 
clit. The courier lifted her head at the sensation, staring in amazement 
as she managed to bend her legs at the knees, giving Erika and Samantha 
more room to move. Reaching back while she still had the will to do so, 
Miranda snatched up a pillow and put it under her back to support 
herself as she watched, her fingers then running through the hair of 
both her lovers, encouraging them to continue.

Both women obliged the courier, their lips almost touching as they began 
taking turns lapping at Miranda&#39;s womanhood, with Samantha&#39;s long red 
hair falling across one of the courier&#39;s thighs, their hands slowly 
sliding upwards towards Miranda&#39;s breasts. 

When their hands held her bosom, Miranda&#39;s head fell back onto the 
mattress, the pillow beneath her causing the courier&#39;s breasts to be 
presented more invitingly to the gentle caressing hands whose fingers 
squeezed her nipples as they touched her. With her eyes squeezed tightly 
closed, Miranda felt her inner muscles beginning to clench, the 
sensation causing her haggard breathing to quicken as the courier 
realized that their was no turning back.

Then, as though it all weren&#39;t enough, Miranda felt Erika and Samantha&#39;s 
tongues both touch her clit at the same time, the two entwining 
occasionally as their sensuous assault of the hardened nub became almost 
ruthless. The two women didn&#39;t stop there, however, as the courier felt 
Erika&#39;s middle finger slid up inside of her, the ease with which the 
digit traveled causing a silent exclamation to escape Miranda&#39;s throat.

As her whole body shook, the exclamation became something of a long 
whimpering moan. The girl struggled for but a moment to close her mouth, 
to grit her teeth to stifle the embarrassing sound that was sure to 
follow, but instead Miranda felt her back arch even higher, her skin 
tingling as her inner walls squeezed desperately against Erika&#39;s 
unmoving finger, almost pushing it out as Miranda reached her peak.

Both Erika and Samantha glanced over at Miranda as the girl let out a 
loud screaming moan, her body suddenly shaking violently, the two having 
to hold down Miranda&#39;s legs lest she injure one of them. For what seemed 
an eternity, Miranda thrashed about, her body finally letting go, her 
mind laughing in the face of her bitter memories as she came. 

When at last she had calmed down enough that Erika and Samantha could 
relax, they both crawled further up the bed, their arms and legs 
wrapping about the girl, holding Miranda closely as hot tears rolled 
down the courier&#39;s cheeks. The two snuggled closer as she wept, giving 
the girl all the time she needed to come down and to regain control of 
herself after having underestimated the intensity of the act.

After several minutes, Erika lifted her head and gave Miranda a soft 
kiss upon the lips, smiling fondly as she brushed her nose against the 
courier&#39;s. &quot;Are you going to be okay, Miri?&quot; she inquired softly.

Miranda opened her eyes part way and looked up at the woman, her bottom 
lip trembling as Samantha retrieved the pillow that Miranda had somehow 
managed to fling onto the floor after having it under her back. After a 
moment the courier nodded, a small shy smile creeping across her lips as 
she lifted her head for Samantha push the pillow beneath it.

&quot;How do you feel now?&quot; Samantha inquired teasingly, slipping an arm 
around her, overtop of Erika&#39;s.

Miranda glanced away, her cheeks flushing as she wetted her dry lips. 
&quot;I, I&#39;m suddenly terribly hungry,&quot; she admitted with a bit of a chuckle.

&quot;My work is never done,&quot; chuckled Samantha sighing with mock weariness 
as she clambered off of the bed and headed back towards dressing table.

&quot;That is something of a curious reaction, I must admit,&quot; Erika mused, 
her head propped up on her hand as she lay on her side beside the 
courier, the woman&#39;s emerald eyes watching her naked apprentice as she 
picked up the tray and came back towards the bed.

Erika then turned her gaze back to Miranda as the courier blushed, her 
stormy gray eyes glancing away. &quot;It&#39;s better than falling asleep right 
away,&quot; she replied, the courier&#39;s mirthful tone tainted by only a hint 
of bitterness.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to hear that,&quot; said Erika softly, taking Miranda&#39;s hand and 
giving her knuckles a gentle kiss, &quot;The time after lovemaking should be 
just as special as the act itself. Simply falling asleep right 
afterwards... It&#39;s almost an affront.&quot;

Miranda turned her head and looked up at Erika as Samantha sat down on 
the edge of the bed. &quot;It&#39;s okay, I guess,&quot; the courier replied 
thoughtfully, squeezing Erika&#39;s hand as she felt the woman&#39;s fingers 
tighten around hers, &quot;It gave me time to finish what he started.&quot;

There was a quiet clatter as Samantha&#39;s teacup half-fell into its 
saucer. &quot;You- You mean you never-?!&quot; the woman stammered, her dark green 
eyes going wide as a scandalized expression crossed her face.

&quot;No, not &#39;with&#39; him,&quot; Miranda replied, closing her eyes and sighing a 
little as she felt Erika&#39;s arm slide around her a moment before Samantha 
set down her tea and hugged the courier as well.

&quot;How terribly selfish...&quot; Erika murmured, shaking her head slowly as the 
three held one another.

&quot;It&#39;s just another way that my Mother was right, I guess,&quot; Miranda 
sighed, opening her eyes and staring up at the creeping ivy patterns of 
the canopy above them once more.

&quot;Would it be inappropriate to ask,&quot; inquired Samantha after a quiet 
moment had passed, causing Miranda to turn towards her curiously, &quot;how 
many times were you &#39;together&#39;?&quot;

Miranda sighed heavily, closing her eyes and slowly shaking her head. 
&quot;No, no. It&#39;s alright,&quot; the girl assured, taking Samantha&#39;s hand and 
giving it a small squeeze, &quot;We... It was three times.&quot;

There was a quiet moment in which Miranda felt compelled to open her 
eyes. She did so just in time to catch the silent communication between 
Erika and her apprentice. The two smiled softly at one another before 
turning back to Miranda. 

&quot;Here,&quot; said Samantha, retrieving her hand before reaching back to night 
table where she&#39;d placed the plate of cookies that had arrived with the 
tea before bringing one close to Miranda&#39;s lips, &quot;Eat. You&#39;ll need to 
regain some of your strength.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Miranda inquired, taking a small bite of the offered cookie, her 
stormy gray eyes glancing between Samantha and Erika.

&quot;Unless you have an objection, deary,&quot; the Gym Leader replied with a 
hint of amusement, &quot;We&#39;ll be bringing you to ecstasy at least one more 
time tonight.&quot;

Miranda&#39;s eyes widened and the girl blushed profusely as she pushed the 
piece of cookie aside in her mouth to speak. &quot;A second?&quot; she chuckled, 
struggling to sit up so she wouldn&#39;t choke.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Erika said with a slow, thoughtful nod, her mysterious emerald 
eyes gleaming with intensity as the woman held up three fingers, &quot;You 
are owed three. But I think that the third should be induced by your 
true love.&quot;

&quot;My- My true love?!&quot; stammered Miranda, swallowing as she tried not to 
laugh, receiving a nod from the Gym Leader, &quot;I- I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have 
one of those. And with my track record, I&#39;m not exactly holding my 
breath!&quot;

Samantha gave a small chuckle as she placed a fresh cup of tea in the 
courier&#39;s hands. &quot;Erika&#39;s trying to say that you&#39;re beautiful, Miranda,&quot; 
said the redhead with an amused grin, &quot;It won&#39;t be too long before you 
find someone new.&quot;

&quot;Just please, make certain that it&#39;s the right someone,&quot; added Erika in 
a serious tone, her expression almost pleading and full of concern as 
she sat up next to the courier.

Miranda nodded thoughtfully, staring down into her tea for a moment 
before smiling as Samantha brought the shortbread cookie back to her 
lips. &quot;You said you were hungry,&quot; she said with an amused grin that grew 
wider as Miranda bit into it.

The courier simply nodded, smiling as she took a deep sip of her tea a 
moment later. &quot;I am,&quot; she agreed, smiling thoughtfully as a chuckle 
escaped Miranda&#39;s lips, &quot;Although I think this explains a whole lot.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Erika inquired, accepting a cup of tea from Samantha as she 
listened with genuine interest as well as amusement.

Miranda nodded several times as she tried not to laugh. &quot;Yeah, when I 
was younger my parents used to order out a few times a week. Usually 
pretty late at night,&quot; she explained, her eyes looking distant, &quot;I 
remember because I&#39;d always hear my Father and the delivery guy from the 
Yin Tze laughing downstairs when the food arrived. And on the nights I 
didn&#39;t hear them, there was always the takeout boxes in the fridge to 
give them away. I guess it&#39;s a good thing that restaurant never closes.&quot;

&quot;I wonder if they got discounts for ordering so often?&quot; mused Samantha, 
the talk of so much food causing her to eye the remaining cookies 
hungrily.

Miranda laughed and nodded. &quot;The owner used to joke that if my parents 
ever actually learned to cook, he&#39;d be out of a job,&quot; she chuckled, her 
expression suddenly becoming serious as her tone darkened slightly, &quot;Hm. 
I wonder if that&#39;s why he didn&#39;t show up for the wedding?&quot;

&quot;When your Mother remarried?&quot; inferred Erika, still always one step 
ahead, to which Miranda nodded.

&quot;Bob&#39;s an aspiring chef, actually,&quot; the courier said simply, reaching 
across Samantha both to set down her empty teacup and to hide her 
expression long enough to banish it, &quot;But, do you think we could discuss 
this later? It&#39;s not really my favourite topic.&quot;

&quot;And just what would you prefer to talk about?&quot; inquired Samantha 
teasingly as Miranda settled back against the headboard and blushed 
suddenly.

&quot;Do you know what I just realized?&quot; the courier said quietly, her 
expression rather embarrassed as she pushed her legs closer together and 
shrank down a little, &quot;We&#39;re all naked.&quot;

Miranda closed her eyes as the other two laughed. &quot;I&#39;m glad that we 
don&#39;t make you feel uncomfortable, then,&quot; replied Erika, setting down 
her tea and glancing across at her apprentice significantly, &quot;It&#39;s 
important to be comfortable with someone you intend to make love with.&quot;

Miranda nodded, glancing at Samantha as she slipped out of bed again, 
feeling a little envious of the way the woman seemed completely 
unconcerned by her nakedness and thoroughly comfortable with her own 
body.

&quot;Thank you, by the way,&quot; the courier replied quietly, turning back to 
Erika as the redhead opened the top drawer of the dresser and began to 
search for something.

&quot;Whatever for?&quot; Erika inquired softly, her hand holding the side of 
Miranda&#39;s face fondly.

&quot;For everything,&quot; Miranda replied, smiling happily as she leaned forward 
and gave the woman a small kiss on the cheek, &quot;It&#39;s been a lovely 
holiday for me. A bit of an emotional roller coaster, but I&#39;m far from 
regretting it.&quot;

Erika smiled back, glancing past Miranda for a brief second before 
meeting the girl&#39;s gaze. &quot;It&#39;s not over yet,&quot; she assured, running her 
fingers through the courier&#39;s dark locks, &quot;unless you want it to be.&quot;

&quot;Goodness no!&quot; Miranda blurted out, covering her face with her hands and 
laughing at herself.

&quot;Then lay down again,&quot; Erika said softly, not seeming to mind Miranda&#39;s 
enthusiasm, &quot;And just relax. I&#39;d like to try something, but I want you 
to stop us the moment it becomes uncomfortable for you, okay?&quot;

Miranda sighed happily, her eyes remaining closed as the girl slid down 
along the bed, laying herself out down the middle of the mattress. &quot;I 
trust you,&quot; she said quietly, opening one eye questioningly as she felt 
Erika move to straddle her hips.

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; the Gym Leader said with a small giggle, her smile 
mischievous as Samantha came up behind the woman and placed a colourful 
silk robe about her shoulders.

&quot;Do I even want to know?&quot; the courier inquired with a nervous chuckle, 
trying to see past her as Samantha backed away and Erika slipped her 
arms into the robe properly before spreading it out a bit.

&quot;Now it&#39;s no fair if you look, deary,&quot; the woman explained in a 
mysterious tone, smiling unconsciously down at Miranda as behind her 
Samantha&#39;s hands ran slowly up the courier&#39;s legs, &quot;it&#39;ll ruin the 
surprise.&quot;

Miranda just nodded, looking up into Erika&#39;s eyes as the woman smiled 
knowingly. Behind her, her apprentice traced a path of alternating 
kisses up Miranda&#39;s inner thighs, Samantha&#39;s fingers running along the 
contours of the courier&#39;s muscles appreciatively as she moved ever 
higher.

&quot;Your job agrees with you,&quot; the redhead murmured, chuckling quietly as 
she crawled up onto the bed her lips brushing Miranda&#39;s labia as she 
spoke.

Miranda simply sighed in response, closing her eyes and exhaling slowly 
as she felt the tip of Samantha&#39;s tongue run up the line between her 
labia, moving slowly back down against as the woman&#39;s hands gently 
squeezed her thighs, coaxing them a little further apart. 

At the same time, Erika&#39;s small soft hands cupped Miranda&#39;s breasts, her 
fingers gently rubbing the girl&#39;s nipples as she smiled down at her 
fondly. Miranda&#39;s hips jumped a little at the feeling of Samantha&#39;s 
tongue upon her clit, Erika chuckled, bringing her legs closer together 
to hold Miranda still as she marveled at the expressions that crossed 
the courier&#39;s face. 

&quot;You&#39;re so beautiful when you&#39;re in ecstasy,&quot; the Gym Leader mused, her 
right hand moving to touch the courier&#39;s cheek, caressing it softly as 
Miranda began to squirm beneath her, &quot;Makes me wonder why anyone would 
want to make love in the dark.&quot;

Miranda smiled, blushing as she turned away, concentrating on the 
sensation of Samantha&#39;s tongue as it slid slowly inside of her, the 
courier&#39;s wetness meeting the probing tongue and causing her lover to 
moan appreciatively. 

&quot;I&#39;d say Samantha approves as well,&quot; Erika chuckled, leaning downward to 
give Miranda the softest of kisses upon the courier&#39;s lips.

&quot;I just can&#39;t help it, this is all too much-!&quot; the girl sighed, arching 
her back suddenly as the sensations from her womanhood intensified 
momentarily. 

Erika smiled as Miranda fell back down, her panting breathing slowing 
once again. &quot;We can stop if you&#39;d like,&quot; said Erika with a small 
chuckle, causing Miranda&#39;s eyes to open wide as she stammered up at the 
woman.

&quot;D-don&#39;t you dare!&quot; she laughed, covering her face with her hands to hid 
her embarrassment, peeking out from between her fingers as Miranda felt 
Samantha suddenly stop.

&quot;Wha-?&quot; the courier began, resisting the urge to look past Erika as the 
woman smiled mysteriously.

&quot;Just relax, okay?&quot; said Erika softly, her fingers running through 
Miranda&#39;s long dark locks as Samantha slipped off the bed for a moment 
before returning and chuckling quietly to herself, &quot;And stop us if this 
gets to be too much for you, okay?&quot;

Miranda chuckled, stretching out upon the bed as she smiled contentedly. 
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t dream of it,&quot; she assured a touch apprehensively, taking a 
deep breath and tensing a bit as she waited for Samantha to continue.

Erika nodded, sitting up and watching the courier intently as behind her 
an ominous -click- was followed by a low hum. Miranda&#39;s eyes went wide 
at the sound, her heart racing as Samantha muffled the sound for several 
seconds.

&quot;Just warming it up,&quot; the redhead muttered quietly, the quiet hum 
becoming louder again as Samantha adjusted herself to be more 
comfortable between Miranda&#39;s legs.

Miranda could only gasp as she then felt something soft, warm and 
vibrating touch her womanhood, the gentle humming purr alone causing her 
to blush a little. The courier&#39;s body tensed for a moment, her back 
arching as she felt the blunted end of the object slide easily up 
between her already slick labia. Miranda let out a long sigh as Samantha 
pulled it back, chuckling as she watched the courier squirm.

&quot;Is that okay?&quot; came Samantha&#39;s questioning tone, looking sideways 
around Erika at Miranda who&#39;s eyes remained closed as she nodded 
quickly.

&quot;Just- What the heck is that?!&quot; she questioned, her laughter causing 
both of her lover&#39;s to smile.

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s just a little something I picked up from Angelique&#39;s,&quot; Erika 
replied with a smile, her hands taking Miranda&#39;s and bringing them up to 
her bosom.

Miranda blushed, her shaking fingers giving Erika&#39;s a gentle squeeze as 
she felt the device press against her skin once more. &quot;I- I&#39;m almost 
afraid to ask,&quot; the courier chuckled, tilting her head to see around the 
woman, causing Erika to lean to the side to block Miranda&#39;s view with 
the open folds of her robe.

&quot;Now, now, deary,&quot; the Gym Leader teased, leaning to the left as Miranda 
turned to see past her in that direction, &quot;it&#39;s no fair peeking. Unless 
you&#39;d prefer that I&#39;d blindfold you?&quot;

Miranda&#39;s eyes widened, her cheeks flushing hotly as she stared up at 
the woman for a moment, stammering to find the right words. &quot;I- Um, 
goodness no!&quot; she laughed, soliciting a contented smile from Erika whose 
hands gave Miranda&#39;s breasts a gentle squeeze as she leaned forward to 
kiss the girl&#39;s nose playfully.

&quot;So long as you&#39;re enjoying it,&quot; Erika whispered, leaning back as 
Miranda nodded slowly, the low purring hum sounding all the louder to 
the courier&#39;s ears as Samantha pressed it gently against her womanhood, 
sliding the spongy end of the device slowly up and down her labia before 
carefully pushing it forward experimentally.

The courier closed her eyes as she felt the gentle push, her hands 
falling away before her fingers clutched up twin handfuls of the 
bedcovers and she gave a small nod, certain that the look upon her 
expression might seem anything but willing as Miranda concentrated on 
both the sensation and relaxing her muscles. For a long moment she could 
feel the soft, spongy material that sheathed the vibrator holding steady 
against her, neither pushing forward nor relenting, as it sent constant 
tingles up the courier&#39;s spine. 

Miranda swallowed hard, her body shivering as she panted, willing 
Samantha to push it a little further, the girl&#39;s need beginning to 
outweigh her apprehension. &quot;It- It&#39;s okay,&quot; the courier breathed, 
opening her eyes part way and giving Erika a weak smile, &quot;I want this.&quot;

The woman smiled softly back down at Miranda, her hand holding the 
courier&#39;s face fondly as Samantha responded to the request. Erika&#39;s 
smile broadened a little, and her cheeks flushed slightly as Miranda&#39;s 
stormy gray eyes widened.

Behind Erika, her apprentice pushed the vibrator almost imperceptivity 
harder, sending a deeper chill up Miranda&#39;s spine as it began to slide 
inside of her. As it stopped once again, the courier found herself 
panting, surprised by the fact that she&#39;d been holding her breath.

&quot;I- I&#39;ll be okay,&quot; she assured, closing her eyes and releasing her grip 
on the blankets, the courier&#39;s hands sliding tentatively towards Erika&#39;s 
legs.

The Gym Leader gave a small nod, her mysterious emerald eyes watching 
the girl&#39;s hands for a moment as they came slowly up her thighs, the 
softness of the touch causing Erika to give a quiet, contented sigh.

&quot;You&#39;re concerned about making mistakes,&quot; the woman said softly as her 
apprentice made small, slow circles with the phallic toy, causing 
Miranda&#39;s hips to move in response, held mostly in place by Erika, &quot;You 
shouldn&#39;t be. We don&#39;t expect perfection from you, especially since this 
is all so new to you.&quot;

Miranda nodded, turning away from Erika as she blushed, watching the 
flickering flame of a near-by candle. &quot;It is,&quot; the girl agreed, her body 
giving another little shiver as Samantha pushed the vibrator a little 
further, causing Miranda to let out a small gasp as she realized just 
how willingly her body accepted the slow, gentle intruder.

&quot;It... It&#39;s also so much... &#39;Nicer&#39;,&quot; Miranda agreed once she&#39;d caught 
her breath once more, turning back to look up at Erika and blinking away 
the glare of the candle flame, &quot;you&#39;re both so patient.&quot;

&quot;We have all the time in the world, Miranda,&quot; assured Erika with a 
chuckle, her hand sliding down the curve of Miranda&#39;s neck before both 
of them cupped the courier&#39;s breasts once more, &quot;I can&#39;t think of a 
single reason in the world to rush this. Weather it&#39;s the first time, or 
the thousandth, making love should always be something special.&quot;

Miranda sighed heavily, a hint of sadness entering her tone as she 
spoke. &quot;He couldn&#39;t wait you know,&quot; she said heavily, suddenly feeling 
Erika&#39;s hands up her own, their fingers linking almost absently.

&quot;That&#39;s not going to happen here,&quot; came Erika&#39;s reply, her tone filled 
with a stern conviction that softened almost immediately, &quot;consideration 
for others is yet another one of the things I teach here. Another is how 
not to let the past consume your present. Please, Miranda, allow us to 
help you.&quot;

The courier closed her eyes slowly, her fingers giving Erika&#39;s hands a 
firm squeeze. &quot;Then show me Erika,&quot; Miranda said quietly, taking a deep 
breath as she moved her legs further apart for Samantha&#39;s benefit, 
&quot;teach me everything I need to know.&quot;

Erika smiled, her hands squeezing back as Miranda let out a silent gasp 
of surprise. The courier then smiled, giggling softly at herself for not 
having noticed Samantha&#39;s withdraw of the vibrator. Then, as it slid 
back the way it came, pausing at each resistance and allowing Miranda&#39;s 
body time to catch up, the courier arched her back and inhaled slowly.

She held the position for a moment, her fingers squeezing Erika&#39;s for a 
long moment as she felt the end vibrator slid inside of her. When at 
last she nodded, exhaling slowly, the girl&#39;s back falling down onto the 
bed, Miranda felt it slide further, her inner walls parting to 
accommodate the vibrator but at the same time clinging wetly to it.

Opening her eyes, Miranda saw Erika glance over her shoulder and smile. 
The courier then caught the faintest hint of laughter from Samantha 
before feeling the warmth of the woman&#39;s tongue upon her clit. 

Miranda gasped at the sensation, her back arching once more as Erika 
lifted their finger-linked hands and moved forward to lie across her, 
the woman&#39;s lips finding the courier&#39;s as their fingers released one 
another.

As Samantha&#39;s warm, nimble tongue circled slowly around her clit, 
Miranda all but threw her arms around Erika, holding the woman tightly, 
clinging to her desperately as the vibrator slid back slowly before 
sliding forward again. As the redhead began a slow rhythm, pushing and 
pulling the phallic toy back and forth, each time pushing a little 
further than before as her tongue relentlessly caressed Miranda&#39;s clit, 
the courier moaning helplessly into Erika&#39;s mouth, closing her eyes 
tightly as she clung desperately to her lover.

The woman took advantage of this immediately, giggling softly as she 
found Miranda&#39;s tongue with her own, teasing her lover by pulling back 
as the courier responded in kind. When Miranda opened her eyes to find 
Erika&#39;s head pulled away, the woman&#39;s teasing smile made her giggle as 
the courier lifted her head and placed a soft kiss upon Erika&#39;s lips.

&quot;How does it feel?&quot; Erika inquired softly, returning the gesture with a 
small, swift teasing kiss on the end of Miranda&#39;s nose.

The courier blushed at the thought, glancing away and grinning in a way 
she was certain made her look ridiculous as Erika placed a dozen random 
kisses upon her face. For a moment, Miranda simply let herself enjoy the 
curious vibrations of the phallic toy as it slid slowly in and out of 
her womanhood, its sound seeming embarrassingly loud as sound traveled 
up along the courier&#39;s spine and directly to her ears.

&quot;It... It&#39;s not really quite like anything I&#39;ve experienced before,&quot; 
Miranda replied carefully, her mind swimming in the sensation as she 
struggled to find the words, &quot;But I like it...&quot;

Erika could only smile as Miranda, blushed all the more, holding her 
eyes tightly closed in embarrassment at the admission. &quot;That&#39;s a good 
thing, deary,&quot; the woman whispered softy, her hands holding the sides of 
Miranda&#39;s face as she gave the courier another soft kiss upon the lips.

Erika lost her train of thought, however, her eyes widening 
imperceptivity as she felt Samantha&#39;s tongue lick slowly up along her 
labia. As the woman&#39;s body tensed momentarily, Miranda opened her eyes 
and gave her lover a questioning look.

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Erika replied with a quiet chuckle, her body giving a small 
shiver at the sensation, receiving an amused smile from Miranda whose 
eyes widened suddenly, the girl gasping as she felt the vibrator slowly 
twist counterclockwise, the device rotating easily due to her wetness, a 
fact that caused the courier to blush again.

&quot;You&#39;re going to catch fire if this keeps up, deary,&quot; the Gym Leader 
said teasingly, her finger&#39;s caressing the softness of Miranda&#39;s cheeks, 
her lips kissing the ends of the courier&#39;s embarrassed smile, &quot;I hope 
this doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not comfortable with this.&quot;

Miranda shook her head quickly at the question, chuckling a little as 
she found it hard to concentrate on both Erika&#39;s words and to what 
Samantha was doing to her. &quot;It&#39;s okay, it&#39;s okay...&quot; the courier replied 
wistfully, her body giving a small shudder as the sensation began to 
bring her a familiar feeling of semi-euphoria. 

Erika nodded slowly, wetting her lips as she watched the girl beneath 
her begin to tremble. She could only smile at the expression that 
crossed Miranda&#39;s face. The quiet, whimpering gasps that the courier let 
out only adding to the distraction of Samantha&#39;s tongue as it moved from 
Erika&#39;s to Miranda&#39;s clit and back again. 

The woman blushed as she lowered her head, feeling Miranda&#39;s hands slip 
under her concealing colourful robe to slide across Erika&#39;s back before 
holding her tightly. &#39;I&#39;ve taught you well, Samantha, dear,&#39; the Gym 
Leader mused, sighing softly into Miranda&#39;s ear as the two held each 
other, both of them moving closer to the moment of ecstasy as Erika&#39;s 
apprentice did her best to make it memorable.

Erika was the first to finally let go, being more comfortable with the 
situation, and having no fear of appearing foolish before her guest. 
With a sudden exclamation, the woman arched her back, pushing down 
against the bed with both hands as she lifted her head towards the 
ceiling.

Miranda opened her eyes at the sound, her expression becoming 
embarrassed once more as she tried to contain her excitement. The 
courier&#39;s efforts were to no avail, though, as she stared up at the 
already beautiful woman before her, made all the more so by the ecstasy 
that gripped her.

Almost without realizing it, Miranda&#39;s hands moved to cup Erika&#39;s 
breasts, her fingers entrapping the woman&#39;s hardened nipples and 
squeezing them tightly as Erika gritted her teeth, her body shaking 
almost violently. 

The sight of Erika&#39;s ecstasy soon became almost too much for the girl to 
take, but as a long, deeply felt exclamation escaped her lover&#39;s lips, 
and Erika flung her head back forward to stare intensely down at 
Miranda, the courier knew there was nothing she could do to stop it.

There was simply something in Erika&#39;s eyes at that moment, a deeply 
rooted passion that overlaid the woman&#39;s normal serenity. In that 
moment, Erika completely let go, with no boundaries or barriers to hide 
her feelings. What Miranda saw was an all-consuming desire, a desire for 
the courier herself.

Miranda let out a half surprised exclamation of her own, suddenly 
feeling the vibrator holding steady inside of her as a peculiar warmth 
touched her own hardened clit. A heartbeat later and Miranda realized 
that it was Erika&#39;s wetness that had touched her. 

With that, Miranda&#39;s back arched, her head pressing against the pillow 
as Erika came back down to place a series of frantic kisses along the 
courier&#39;s neck. As her body shook, convulsing beneath Erika, Miranda 
stopped caring about looking foolish. She no longer worried about other 
people overhearing or about being made fun of for the silly expressions 
upon her face or the things she might find herself saying.

Miranda simply let go. Her lungs practically emptied of air as she 
screamed out her pent-up emotion. She lost control over her limbs, and 
soon lost track of them. Soon even gravity lost all meaning and the 
courier felt as though she weighed nothing at all, the only thing 
planting her to the bed being the intense sensations from her womanhood, 
and the aching of her clit that demanded more and more of Samantha&#39;s 
attention.

Time soon lost all meaning, and Miranda had no way of knowing whether a 
moment or an hour had passed. But when at last reality began to make 
sense to her once more, Miranda felt the warm, comforting presence of 
two bodies pressed up against her. Distantly, the girl could hear 
herself panting, and she realized just how much the experience had taken 
out of her. 

Opening her eyes, Miranda was surprised to find them wet with drying 
tears, and blushed as she felt Erika&#39;s soft lips kiss her cheek fondly. 
&quot;Are you okay, Miri?&quot; the woman inquired quietly, brushing the courier&#39;s 
hair from her eyes.

&quot;You almost gave us a bit of a scare on that one, deary,&quot; added Samantha 
with a bit of a chuckle, her fingers wiping away the moisture from 
Miranda&#39;s opposite cheek, &quot;After all, there&#39;s no way I&#39;m -that- good!&quot;

Miranda laughed happily, finding her arms holding both women as their 
legs entwined. &quot;I&#39;m afraid that you are,&quot; she agreed, turning to the 
redhead with a blushing grin, &quot;I just hope you don&#39;t think it was unfair 
of us to make you do all the work.&quot;

Samantha gave the courier a bit of an overdone pout that made them both 
smile before kissing Miranda teasingly on the chin. &quot;Well, if you feel 
so bad about it, you could always make it up to me,&quot; she suggested, 
making her voice sound slightly helpless, &quot;After watching that rather 
entertaining display of yours, I&#39;m afraid that I&#39;ve become 
unconscionablely randy.&quot;

Miranda turned her head towards Erika and received a reassuring smile in 
answer to her silent question. &quot;It is only fair,&quot; the woman soft with a 
hint of mischief in her voice, &quot;She did so much for both of us, that 
it&#39;s only fair that we return the favour. Wouldn&#39;t you agree, deary?&quot;

The courier nodded and took a moment to retrieve her limbs before 
sitting up and looking nervously down at the still smiling Orange 
Islander. &quot;If, if I mess up here, be sure to tell me okay?&quot; Miranda 
inquired shyly, shrugging her shoulders a bit.

Samantha chuckled at the thought, shaking her head in amusement. &quot;Just 
do whatever comes to mind, deary,&quot; she said gently, touching the 
Miranda&#39;s cheek fondly, &quot;your body knows what to do, even if you don&#39;t. 
Just listen to it, and don&#39;t think that you need to be perfect or 
anything. This isn&#39;t a competition or anything.&quot;

Miranda swallowed hard, her body shaking with nervous excitement as she 
nodded slowly. &quot;Well, it sounds like a sound idea,&quot; the courier replied, 
a bit of an embarrassed laugh entering into her voice as she glanced 
shyly back at Erika, &quot;But I&#39;m just not completely sure where to begin.&quot; 

Miranda was a little surprised not to be laughed at, but quickly 
chastised herself for the thought as Erika smiled back at her fondly, 
slipping an arm about the courier&#39;s shoulders and drawing her closer.

&quot;That&#39;s alright,&quot; Erika said softly as both she and Samantha sat up, 
flanking Miranda&#39;s sides, &quot;Just relax and let your body tell you what to 
do. Don&#39;t be afraid of doing what comes naturally, and please don&#39;t 
worry about what we&#39;ll think. You&#39;re not in competition with anyone but 
yourself.&quot;

Miranda merely nodded slowly, pushing down her nervousness as she turned 
towards Erika, her hand touching the side of the woman&#39;s face, caressing 
it gently. &quot;Then, may I kiss you again?&quot; she inquired hesitantly, the 
courier&#39;s pale complexion reddening as Miranda managed to find the words 
to necessary to express her desire.

Erika&#39;s smile was all the permission she needed, and Miranda found the 
woman&#39;s lips meet her own halfway. The soft warmth of Erika&#39;s lips eased 
the girl&#39;s tension almost immediately, causing Miranda to let out a soft 
sigh as she pulled away, subconsciously wetting her lips before turning 
to Samantha. 

&#39;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m doing this,&#39; the courier mused inwardly, the 
mischievous smile upon Samantha&#39;s face causing Miranda to fight back a 
grin as she felt the woman&#39;s fingers slip through her hair, holding 
Miranda&#39;s head still as Samantha moved closer.

&quot;You know,&quot; the redhead whispered softly, brushing her lips lightly 
across Miranda&#39;s as she spoke, her eyes looking searchingly into 
Miranda&#39;s own, &quot;I can still taste you upon my lips.&quot;

The words caused Miranda to blush deeper even as Samantha suppressed a 
bit of a giggle before pressing her lips against the courier&#39;s, giving 
Miranda a quick, playful kiss before pulling back. To her surprise, 
however, Samantha immediately felt Miranda move forward, repositioning 
herself and taking hold of the woman&#39;s shoulder as the courier kissed 
her firmly.

Taken aback for a moment by Miranda&#39;s sudden lack of restraint, Samantha 
sighed heavily as she leaned back against her pillow, almost melting as 
Miranda moved to straddle her legs, kneeling before her as the courier&#39;s 
hands slid slowly down from Samantha&#39;s shoulders, down to the woman&#39;s 
breasts. Samantha tilted her head forward slightly as she felt Miranda&#39;s 
fingers entrap her nipples between them, gently squeezing them as the 
girl gave her breasts the softest of squeezes, her fingertips shifting 
slightly to caress them. 

As their kiss was broken, leaving Miranda once more panting for breath, 
her body shaking all over, Samantha put her arms around the girl to 
steady her. &quot;You okay?&quot; she inquired softly, her tone holding a hint of 
seriousness and concern.

&quot;So long as you are,&quot; the courier replied hesitantly, glancing suddenly 
over at Erika who was watching them both intently, an approving smile 
crossing her lips as their eyes met, &quot;And, so long as you&#39;re not 
jealous, that is...&quot;

Erika gave a soft chuckle, moving closer and giving Miranda a soft kiss 
just behind the ear. &quot;I feel only a little envious,&quot; she admitted, her 
tone seemingly amused by the thought.

&quot;Envious? Of what?&quot; Miranda inquired, giving the Gym Leader a confused 
look as she tried once more to follow Erika&#39;s often peculiar seeming 
logic. 

The woman sighed softly, both her hands reaching out, each one sliding 
behind one of their heads, her fingers slipping affectionately through 
both Miranda and Samantha&#39;s hair as she spoke. &quot;Of my dear apprentice,&quot; 
Erika replied, receiving a soft chuckle from Samantha, who bowed her 
head slightly to hide her amusement, &quot;for being the recipient of your 
passion, Miri. You are such a gentle girl on the outside, but I can see 
the fire in your eyes. You&#39;re always so careful. Trying not to become 
overly excited, or to let people know that you have such strong 
feelings.&quot;

&quot;What are you saying?&quot; the courier inquired softly, suddenly not finding 
the strength to deny the words she knew to be true.

&quot;That you shouldn&#39;t force calmness and control upon your inner turmoil,&quot; 
Erika explained, her fingers running through Miranda&#39;s hair soothingly, 
&quot;that you shouldn&#39;t be afraid of letting it all out. Bottling so much 
passion for too long can&#39;t be good for anyone. And, to be honest, seeing 
you release it like you just did is rather exciting to me. It&#39;s like 
watching you be reborn, taking control of both your life, and of your 
mind and body. It&#39;s a beautiful thing, Miranda, and I only wish to share 
in this moment.&quot;

Miranda let out a small chuckle, doing her best to hide behind her dark 
bangs. &quot;I, I guess I&#39;m just not really the submissive type,&quot; she 
concluded with a nervous laugh, suddenly feeling Samantha pull her 
closer into a reassuring embrace, holding the courier tightly as the 
woman gently kissed Miranda&#39;s neck.

&quot;No, no you&#39;re not,&quot; she agreed, a hint of something mischievous 
creeping into Samantha&#39;s tone as she spoke, &quot;but you care too much about 
people to be truly dominant with anyone, don&#39;t you?&quot;

Miranda frowned for a moment, shaking her head slowly as she calmed 
herself, knowing the words to be true. &quot;That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t win in the 
battle we had, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; she inquired thoughtfully, her words more of 
a statement as she held tightly onto Samantha, &quot;Because I&#39;m afraid of 
being too... Too much like my Mom, I guess.&quot;

&quot;And because you&#39;re afraid your pokemon won&#39;t love you if you take 
charge too much,&quot; Erika added carefully.

&quot;A trait that spills over into my human relationships as well, I guess,&quot; 
Miranda concluded, &quot;I&#39;m afraid of my own desire for self-fulfillment 
alienating those I care for...&quot;

&quot;No one can be one hundred percent unselfish, deary,&quot; said Erika softly, 
her voice seeming like a distant island of calm in the turmoil of 
emotions Miranda felt, &quot;But sometimes, what may seem like a selfish 
desire is actually what those you care for want. Some people, and 
especially pokemon, feel a need to be lead. Some more than others. And 
when that leader is someone who is full of love and compassion, a 
seemingly selfish desire to lead can actually be quite a selfless one.&quot; 

Miranda simply nodded, her head resting upon Samantha&#39;s shoulder for a 
long moment. Taking a deep breath, she soon looked up, pulling back far 
enough to look directly into Samantha&#39;s dark green eyes. &quot;I want you to 
lay down on your back,&quot; she said in a serious, yet shaky tone, receiving 
a small reassuring smile, and a quick nod from Samantha. 

As Miranda moved off of her, Samantha obediently shuffled forward before 
lying back down with her head upon one of the bed&#39;s overstuffed pillows. 
This accomplished, Miranda took a deep breath, letting it out slowly as 
she rallied her confidence. The courier then crawled backward down the 
length of the bed, moving sideways before slipping her hands under 
Samantha&#39;s thighs and easily coaxing the woman&#39;s legs to bend at the 
knee, carefully moving them further apart as Miranda lied down on her 
stomach between them, supporting herself on her forearms.

Swallowing down her nervousness, Miranda glanced over the length of her 
lover&#39;s naked form to where Samantha was already propping herself up 
with a second pillow to get a better view. Then, as she glanced down at 
Samantha&#39;s waiting womanhood, Miranda suddenly recalled Erika&#39;s words. 
That they could stop at any time, and all she needed to do was say so. 
&#39;No,&#39; she told herself, trying not the let the surge of eagerness 
embarrass her too much, &#39;There&#39;s no turning back. No running away. No 
more going through life feeling hollow and unsatisfied...&#39;

Miranda then turned her head to one side to gently kiss Samantha&#39;s inner 
thigh, savouring the feeling of her lover&#39;s soft skin and tensing 
nervously as the courier heard Samantha let out a small pleasurable 
gasp. 

&#39;She likes it, it&#39;s okay,&#39; Miranda told herself, glancing sideways at 
her lover&#39;s expression as she began kissing her way along Samantha&#39;s 
thigh, half-smiling as she stopped, her lips dangerously close to her 
lover&#39;s womanhood, Samantha letting out a combination of a moan and a 
gasp as Miranda kissed her way back down.

As her kisses reached halfway down Samantha&#39;s inner thigh, Miranda 
touched the woman&#39;s skin with the tip of her tongue before beginning to 
run it back the other way. It was then that Miranda giggled, suddenly 
feeling Samantha&#39;s body jump as she felt the woman&#39;s fingers take up 
twin handfuls of her hair.

&quot;You&#39;re gonna drive my barmy, dear!&quot; Samantha laughed, her body tensing 
as Miranda&#39;s tongue stopped just as it reached the end of her thigh 
before the girl&#39;s kisses returned, this time heading down the opposite 
leg.

Miranda chuckled softly in response, letting out a soft exclamation as 
Samantha&#39;s fingers squeezed tighter, gently pulling the courier&#39;s dark 
hair and sending a pleasant tingle down her spine. To show her 
appreciation, Miranda turned directly towards Samantha&#39;s womanhood and 
gave her labia a gentle, experimental kiss that caused the Orange 
Islander to suddenly sit straight up, gasping for breath after letting 
out a rather loud exclamation.

&quot;S-sorry,&quot; Samantha chuckled as Miranda stared up at her in amazement, 
&quot;You kinda caught me off guard there.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll try and keep that idea in mind,&quot; commented Erika as Miranda 
covered her mouth to hide her smile as she laughed.

Samantha grinned back at the woman before lying back upon the bed, 
carefully unwinding Miranda&#39;s hair from her fingers before gently 
running them through the girl&#39;s midnight locks, signing contentedly as 
the tip of Miranda&#39;s tongue began running up her labia in long, slow, 
experimental movements. 

Dismissing the thought of giving the courier a word or two of 
encouragement lest it embarrass her, or worse, break her rhythm, 
Samantha&#39;s eyes became half-lidded as she watched the courier lap slowly 
at her labia. Every so often, Miranda&#39;s body would let off a small 
shudder, and Samantha had to smile as the courier&#39;s breathing became 
subtly haggard. 

A few moment&#39;s later, Miranda&#39;s eyes suddenly widened, the girl gasping 
a little and suppressing a bit of nervous laughter as she felt, more 
than tasted Samantha&#39;s arousal upon her tongue. Her lover gave her a 
reassuring smile as she retracted her tongue, examining the flavour for 
a moment before swallowing.

&quot;You okay?&quot; Samantha inquired with a bit of a chuckle, bemused by the 
pleased/embarrassed expression upon the courier&#39;s face.

&quot;P-Perfectly,&quot; Miranda stammered, trying unsuccessfully to banish the 
grin from her face, instead choosing to duck back down and run her 
tongue once more up the line between Samantha&#39;s labia, sighing softly at 
the compelling taste of the wetness that grew between them.

She could then feel Samantha&#39;s fingers running through her hair once 
more as Miranda flattened her tongue, caressing both her lover&#39;s labia 
with it as she lapped at Samantha&#39;s womanhood. Glancing up, Miranda 
could see that Samantha was leaning back somewhat, her head pushing down 
hard against the pillow as she breathed shallowly through her mouth. The 
courier then smiled at the expression etched upon her lover&#39;s face and 
decided it was time to experiment a little more.

Narrowing her tongue to a point, Miranda pressed the tip of it between 
Samantha&#39;s labia near the bottom, barely penetrating the woman yet 
soliciting a sharp gasp. Miranda then began to drag her tongue upwards, 
slowly collecting the stick-sweet wetness upon her tongue before 
stopping at the top, smiling inwardly to herself as she felt Samantha&#39;s 
body tense. Miranda then with drew, watching as her lover&#39;s body relaxed 
rather heavily before repeating the process at an unhurried pace, each 
time pressing her tongue a little deeper into Samantha&#39;s womanhood, and 
being careful to hold off on swallowing the collected moisture. 

Several moments later, and Samantha was clinging tightly to Miranda&#39;s 
hair once again, the girl trying not to laugh as Samantha writhed 
beneath her touch. With her tongue pressing nearly halfway inside, 
Miranda could feel Samantha&#39;s inner walls clench tightly together, 
pushing back at her each time she dragged her tongue upwards, the 
sticky-sweetness of the woman&#39;s desire spilling out across Samantha&#39;s 
labia each time. 

When at last Samantha could take no more, her body shaking as her breath 
came out in whimpering moans, and her fingers pulled Miranda&#39;s face 
closer to her womanhood, the courier finally allowed her tongue to slip 
out and slide wetly up to Samantha&#39;s clit. 

As the courier&#39;s tongue touched the hard, little nub, Samantha arched 
her back, somehow finding the strength to let go of Miranda&#39;s hair as 
not to yank it out as she struggled to vocalize her feelings. Her body 
shook almost violently as the tip of Miranda&#39;s tongue slid over 
Samantha&#39;s clit, inexpertly moving slowly back and forth across it 
before making a slow circle around it, wetting the little nub with the 
woman&#39;s own sticky sweetness. Samantha then forced her hands away from 
Miranda&#39;s hair as she practically convulsed, a prolong, desperate 
exclamation escaping her lips as she instead gripped the courier&#39;s 
shoulders, using her last once of sanity to ensure the woman didn&#39;t 
injure Miranda in return for the joy the courier had given her.

Miranda winced a bit as she felt her lover&#39;s nails dig into her 
shoulders, but found it to be a small price to pay for the elation she 
felt at bringing Samantha to ecstasy. Once the woman was far beyond the 
point of no-return, the courier slipped her tongue lower, pushing it as 
far between Samantha&#39;s labia as she could, covering her lover&#39;s labia 
with her mouth before beginning to suckle with all her might. 

Surprise crossed Samantha&#39;s face for a heartbeat&#39;s time as the 
desperately panting woman turned her head to Erika who was watching with 
intense interest. The redhead could only half-smile and shake her head 
at Miranda&#39;s voracious need to bring her pleasure, but was far from 
arguing. 

Catching the look in Samantha&#39;s eye, however, Erika merely smiled 
approvingly before bending down from her sitting position to give her 
apprentice several soft kisses randomly about her face as Samantha found 
it difficult to close her mouth long enough to kiss back. To further 
prolong her apprentice&#39;s ecstatic torture, Erika&#39;s hand slipped to her 
breast, the woman&#39;s fingertips playing teasingly across it, occasionally 
playfully pinching her nipple, and causing Samantha to moan all the 
more.

Meanwhile, Miranda let out a soft, appreciative sound of her own as 
Samantha all but flooded her mouth, the courier&#39;s tongue almost being 
forced out as the woman&#39;s moist inner walls convulsed around it, the 
flavour seemingly deliciously addictive to Miranda&#39;s pallet. Glancing 
up, Miranda felt a strong urge to smile back as Erika lifted her head 
and looked at her with a pleased expression upon her face. 

&quot;Oh-!&quot; gasped Miranda, pulling her mouth away and panting heavily as she 
only then noticed the ache in her jaw. As she reached up to rub it, 
though, Miranda gave Erika an embarrassed smile, feeling the stick 
wetness upon her face that could have only come from one source. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; assured Erika with a soft chuckle, &quot;it will take her a 
few moment&#39;s to realize you&#39;ve stopped.&quot;

Miranda nodded slowly in understanding, licking her lips clean as she 
watched Samantha for a few moments, wondering if it had taken her as 
long to come down from the experience. &quot;Wow...&quot; was all the courier 
could mutter, shaking her head in amazement, &quot;I- I did this, didn&#39;t I?&quot;

Erika chuckled softly as Samantha&#39;s hands slipped from Miranda&#39;s 
shoulders, sliding down her arms as the still panting woman stared up at 
the courier longingly. &quot;Yes, yes indeed you did,&quot; Erika agreed, moving 
back a bit as Miranda caught the needy look in Samantha&#39;s eyes and 
obligingly crawled overtop of her so they could hold one another.

&quot;Th- thank you,&quot; the redhead sighed heavily, her arms clinging firmly to 
Miranda once the girl had moved close enough.

&quot;No problem,&quot; assured Miranda with a chuckle, giving Samantha a small 
kiss before happily hugging her back, &quot;that was fun. I- I just hope that 
I haven&#39;t worn you out too much.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I think I could go for another round,&quot; Samantha laughed, glancing 
at Erika slyly, hoping to illicit even a hint of jealousy. Finding only 
an approving smile and a nod, though, Samantha gave her lover a small, 
playful pout before grinning broadly.

Miranda, meanwhile, glanced over at the nightstand beside the bed, her 
stormy gray eyes going wide as she spotted the device Samantha had used 
on her. &quot;That&#39;s odd,&quot; commented Miranda without thinking, causing both 
Erika and Samantha to glance back in her direction with some concern, 
&quot;that sure felt a whole lot bigger than it actually is.&quot;

&quot;The mind is the most easily stimulated erogenous zone, my dear,&quot; 
commented Erika with a sly smile, &quot;But yes, I was careful to choose 
something relatively innocuous, seeing as you hadn&#39;t had much experience 
with such things.&quot;

Miranda nodded slowly, moving to a sitting position and straddling 
Samantha&#39;s hips as she stared down at the phallic device, its length 
wrapped in a thick, spongy, dark green material she recalled being 
rather pliable. &quot;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve no experience with &#39;toys&#39; at all,&quot; she 
confessed, immediately blushing, and thankful that neither of her lovers 
commented upon it, &quot;It was really quite something, though...&quot;

The courier&#39;s voice trailed off before she could incriminate herself 
further, but the bemused smile that crossed Samantha&#39;s face when she 
looked down at her told Miranda that she didn&#39;t always need to express 
her thoughts to have them picked upon on. 

&quot;Would you like to give it a go?&quot; Samantha inquired, causing a tingle to 
run up Miranda&#39;s spine, the girl nibbling her bottom lip as she glanced 
back at the device uncertainly, &quot;I wasn&#39;t lying when I said I&#39;d be 
willing to go another round.&quot;

Miranda closed her eyes, inhaling deeply and letting it out slowly 
before nodding, hoping desperately the entire time that she didn&#39;t look 
too embarrassed or terribly over-eager about the prospect. &quot;I, I&#39;d like 
that,&quot; she confessed, reaching out with a shaking hand to take up the 
vibrator, the courier&#39;s gray eyes going wide as her fingers squeezed the 
pliable sheath it was wrapped in.

&quot;The switch is on the bottom,&quot; commented Samantha, a tinge of unashamed 
eagerness apparent in her voice.

Miranda merely nodded, turning the vibrator over and jumping a little as 
her thumb hit the on switch. Miranda then laughed as it hummed quietly 
in her hand, shaking her head in amusement as she shut it off and moved 
away from Samantha. 

&quot;Okay,&quot; the courier instructed after composing herself once again as she 
sat next to the woman, &quot;I... I&#39;d like you to roll over on your stomach 
now.&quot;

Samantha&#39;s eyes went wide as she gave Miranda a bit of a mischievous 
grin. &quot;Gladly!&quot; the woman laughed, causing the courier turn away to hide 
her embarrassed look as Samantha rolled over before sliding up onto her 
hands and knees so that Miranda was kneeling behind her, &quot;I&#39;m actually 
really quite fond of doing it this way.&quot;

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t tell me that!&quot; Miranda replied, covering her face with her 
free hand, shaking her head as she laughed, before taking a moment to 
compose herself.

&quot;Terribly sorry,&quot; said Samantha slyly, looking over her shoulder at 
Miranda, her long, fiery red hair cascading downward dramatically, &quot;I 
promise to be good from now on. Unless you don&#39;t want me to be.&quot; 

Miranda coughed into her hand, glancing to one side as she made an 
attempt to change the subject. &quot;So, you say that the switch is on the 
bottom then?&quot; the courier inquired, turning the vibrator upside down, 
peering at it curiously as Samantha chuckled.

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; she replied with an amused smile, her body shivering 
pleasantly as Samantha felt Miranda&#39;s fingers tentatively touch her 
still wet folds lightly, brushing the silky-soft folds with a level of 
curiosity that filled Samantha with a pleasant feeling.

Miranda nervously nibbled her bottom lip for a moment as her fingers 
brushed lightly over Samantha&#39;s womanhood, two of the pressing lightly 
against her labia as the one in the middle pushed a little more boldly. 
Miranda gasped as she encountered only token resistance, her middle 
finger sinking into the warm wetness as Samantha let out a soft moan and 
shivered pleasantly.

&quot;That&#39;s okay, right?&quot; Miranda inquired, glancing up to find Samantha&#39;s 
head tilted far back, the woman closing her eyes, concentrating solely 
on the sensation of Miranda&#39;s almost tentative touch.

&quot;She&#39;s having a good time, dear,&quot; said Erika softly, coming up behind 
Miranda and slipping her arms about the girl&#39;s waist, &quot;You&#39;ve nothing to 
worry about.&quot;

Miranda nodded slowly, shivering slightly as she felt Erika&#39;s warm, 
naked body press against her own, the woman&#39;s hands sliding idly across 
her skin as Miranda herself pushed her finger deeper, giggling a little 
as she felt Samantha&#39;s inner walls contract upon the digit. 

&quot;Well, at least I know I have some hidden talent,&quot; Miranda chuckled, 
tilting her head to one side as Erika&#39;s slightly parted lips traced a 
line up along her neck to her ear.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find all sorts of hidden talents in you, deary,&quot; 
whispered Erika, her teeth dragging lightly across Miranda&#39;s earlobe, 
causing the courier to shiver, &quot;Assuming you might want to stay on for a 
few more days.&quot;

Miranda nodded slowly, her eyes concentrating for a moment on her finger 
as it slid back out of Samantha&#39;s womanhood before pushing it back in. 
&quot;I, I think I&#39;d like that,&quot; she replied slowly two of her fingers still 
caressing Samantha&#39;s labia as Miranda&#39;s middle finger continued to move 
about inside. 

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; continued Erika, one hand sliding slowly down towards 
Miranda&#39;s womanhood as the other slipped up towards her breast, &quot;There&#39;s 
still so much you could learn here. And so much we still don&#39;t know 
about you...&quot;

Miranda gasped as she felt the tip of Erika&#39;s tongue caress her ear as 
the woman&#39;s hand gently cupped her small breast, squeezing it gently as 
one of Erika&#39;s fingers slid slowly back and forth, caressing Miranda&#39;s 
nipple. At the same time, Erika&#39;s other hand moved lower, the woman 
moving her fingers apart to avoid Miranda&#39;s clit as they traced along 
her skin, sliding down across her labia.

&quot;Is this okay, Miranda?&quot; came Erika&#39;s whispered voice, seemingly from 
far away, but all Miranda could do was to nod in response, her body 
tensing even as a shiver ran up her spine, a deep feeling of need rising 
in Miranda as she felt Erika&#39;s hand lift to avoid touching her clit.

&quot;I, I&#39;m just a little nervous,&quot; the girl confessed, tilting her head 
back and closing her eyes as she felt Erika&#39;s slow line of kisses move 
down across her neck.

&quot;I could always stop,&quot; Erika murmured, her fingers brushing slowly back 
and forth across Miranda&#39;s labia, her touch so light it was almost as 
gentle as a warm Summer&#39;s breeze.

&quot;I&#39;d never forgive you,&quot; Miranda sighed, her thumb switching on the 
vibrator once again, the low humming sound it gave off causing Samantha 
to jump a little, her body quivering in anticipation as the woman held 
her bottom a bit higher.

&quot;You&#39;re so wonderfully insatiable,&quot; Erika giggled, her fingers giving 
Miranda&#39;s nipple a bit of a squeeze that caused the courier to let out a 
gasp of her own, &quot;You&#39;ll probably wear us both out before this night is 
done, yet still be looking for more.&quot;

Miranda moved her head forward, letting her long dark hair fall across 
her face to hide her smile. &quot;This is my first opportunity to be truly... 
&#39;Satisfied&#39;,&quot; the courier chuckled, taking a deep breath as she pulled 
her hand back and brought the vibrator closer to Samantha&#39;s womanhood. 

&quot;So long as it&#39;s not your last,&quot; said Erika with a hint of seriousness, 
turning to watch with great interest as her apprentice gasped at the 
sensation the spongy feeling end of the vibrator touching her bare skin.

&quot;It won&#39;t be. I promise,&quot; assured Miranda, trying unsuccessfully to 
banish the smile that crossed her face as she moved the device slowly up 
and down between Samantha&#39;s labia, causing the woman to jump and squirm 
as she moaned happily, occasionally letting out a small giggle at the 
sensation.

Erika sighed happily, resting her chin upon Miranda&#39;s shoulder, her 
fingers continuing to caress the courier&#39;s womanhood as she watched. 
Then, as Miranda held the vibrator still, she could see Samantha tense 
up at what was to come. But as she began to push the phallic device 
forward, Miranda gasped, feeling Erika&#39;s finger sliding into her at the 
same unhurried, careful pace.

Holding the vibrator still for a moment, Miranda could feel Erika&#39;s 
finger holding steady as well, only the barest bit of it pushing into 
her own warm wetness. As Samantha&#39;s fingers curled, taking up firm 
handfuls of bed sheets, the courier glanced sideways at Erika who merely 
smiled in reply.

&#39;Oh dear...&#39; thought Miranda with a smile, &#39;this, this could get 
interesting.&#39;

Tilting her head back a little and habitually biting her bottom lip, 
Miranda pushed the vibrator forward ever so slightly. Sure enough, as 
Samantha let out the breath she&#39;d been holding, Erika&#39;s finger pushed 
deeper into the courier&#39;s womanhood. 

Unable to stop herself, Miranda let out a small chuckle, turning her 
head to peer into Erika&#39;s all too innocent eyes. Without a word, Miranda 
pressed her lips to Erika&#39;s, tilting her head to one side and sighing 
softly as she felt the woman&#39;s tongue press experimentally against her 
lips.

The courier found herself quick to oblige, shaking a little as she 
parted her lips and touched Erika&#39;s tongue with her own, the sensation 
sending pleasurable chills up her spine. As the two kissed, Miranda 
opened one eye, half-smiling as she pushed the vibrator further, 
inhaling sharply as she saw how easily it slid inside of Samantha, the 
woman&#39;s excitement ensuring her inner walls were ready to accept the 
intruder.

To her surprise, Miranda felt Erika&#39;s finger slide all the way up inside 
of her a heartbeat later. The girl gasped, her body shaking as she held 
perfectly still for a long moment, feeling Erika&#39;s other hand leave her 
breast so that the woman&#39;s arm might hold her steady. When she had at 
last composed herself, Erika merely smiled, kissing Miranda deeply once 
again, her finger beginning to slide slowly in and out of Miranda&#39;s 
womanhood, the feeling of which sent wonderful tingles throughout the 
courier&#39;s body.

Miranda closed her eyes again, concentrating on the sensation, and 
trying to copy Erika&#39;s movements with the vibrator, sliding it slowly in 
and out of Samantha. Occasionally slipping it almost the entire way out 
where Miranda proceeded to tease Samantha with its end for several 
moments before pushing it back into her almost the entire way.

&quot;You&#39;re doing quite well,&quot; whispered Erika as she pulled back, breaking 
off their kiss and leaving them both panting, taking a moment to listen 
to the pleasurable sounds her apprentice let out. 

&quot;You, you&#39;re not still jealous, right?&quot; Miranda inquired a small, 
bemused smile, slowly twisting the vibrator to the right as Samantha let 
out a surprised sound before burring her face in the pillow to letting 
out a particularly loud exclamation.

Erika shook her head slowly, smiling as her free hand moved up to caress 
Miranda&#39;s cheek. &quot;You have so much concern for others,&quot; the woman mused 
happily, &quot;how is it that such a wonderful and pretty girl like you 
hasn&#39;t found someone else to fulfill her needs?&quot;

Miranda smiled back, giving Erika a soft kiss before glancing back down 
at Samantha, her free hand sliding over the rise of the woman&#39;s bottom 
and giving it a firm squeeze. &quot;A courier&#39;s career is like that,&quot; she 
replied softly, smiling as Samantha arched her back, inhaling sharply as 
Miranda slid the vibrator back before pushing it a little deeper than 
before, &quot;But I&#39;m in no hurry to start again.&quot;

Erika nodded, her fingers slipping away from Miranda as the woman slid 
down and laid herself down up the bed upon her back. &quot;What are-?&quot; began 
Miranda, suddenly feeling Erika&#39;s warm, soft hands upon her thighs as 
the woman shuffled closer.

&quot;You&#39;ll see,&quot; Erika replied with a bit of a chuckle, suddenly kissing 
her way up Miranda&#39;s inner thighs, causing the girl&#39;s body to shiver as 
Erika neared the courier&#39;s womanhood.

&quot;Oh, my!&quot; Miranda stammered, her fingers gripping Samantha&#39;s bottom a 
little tighter as she took in a deep breath.

&quot;Something wrong, deary?&quot; teased Samantha, panting as she glanced over 
her shoulder and grinned broadly. 

Miranda glanced back at Samantha and suddenly blushed, her eyes going 
wide as she came back to reality. &quot;Oh, nothing,&quot; the courier assured, 
taking a deep breath and slowly letting it out as she looked down at the 
vibrator, its spongy deep green sheath glistening with Samantha&#39;s 
wetness, &quot;Just a little overwhelmed, I guess...&quot; 

&quot;We could stop if you&#39;d like,&quot; murmured Erika softly, her gentle kisses 
tickling Miranda&#39;s skin and eliciting a soft giggle from the courier.

&quot;Only if you never want me to forgive you,&quot; replied Miranda teasingly, 
closing her eyes and sighing heavily as she felt the barest touch of the 
end of Erika&#39;s tongue as it ran along the line between her labia, the 
sensation just as teasing as her words.

&quot;I think I know that feeling,&quot; added Samantha, nibbling her bottom lip 
as she pushed her hips back, causing the vibrator to slide back into 
herself despite Miranda&#39;s momentarily stationary hand.

&quot;Oh, sorry!&quot; Miranda responded quickly, surprised by Samantha&#39;s 
eagerness, but too distracted by the sensation of Erika&#39;s tongue, 
pressing ever so slightly harder each time the woman lapped at her labia 
to feel embarrassed by it. 

&quot;No, no,&quot; Samantha soothed softly, wetting her lips as she moved back 
and forth, letting Miranda hold the vibrator still for the moment, 
&quot;You&#39;re doing wonderfully, dear. You&#39;ve nothing to apologize for.&quot;

Miranda merely nodded, wetting her lips nervously as she watched the way 
Samantha&#39;s womanhood seemed to cling hungrily to the vibrating toy as 
she pushed back and pulled forward, the courier&#39;s body tingling all over 
as Erika&#39;s tongue seemed to take forever to slide along the length of 
her labia. 

After a few moments the sensation gave Miranda the courage she needed to 
slide her free hand downwards, her touch eliciting a soft moaning sigh 
from Samantha as the courier&#39;s fingertips tentatively touched Samantha&#39;s 
clit. The sensation causing her to jump a little and catch her breath as 
Miranda&#39;s fingers experimentally caressed the hardened nub.

&quot;Is that okay?&quot; the courier inquired softly, inhaling suddenly through 
her teeth and letting the breath back out slowly as she felt Erika&#39;s 
tongue suddenly press upwards, Miranda&#39;s body eagerly accepting the 
intruder.

Samantha&#39;s only reply the question, however, was a bit of a chuckle as 
she caught her breath, torn between amusement and desire. But what her 
voice could not articulate, Samantha&#39;s body said quite clearly by 
pushing back harder upon the vibrator before bucking her hips a bit, the 
woman&#39;s fingers curling as they took up handfuls of the bed sheets.

Miranda gasped as Samantha&#39;s labia pressed suddenly against her fingers, 
leaving warm moisture upon them as she pulled back before pushing 
towards the courier once again. Letting out a small, embarrassed chuckle 
of her own, Miranda twisted the vibrator slightly as Samantha pushed 
back, causing the redhead to let out a shuddering sigh as the courier&#39;s 
legs began to shake from the strain of straddling Erika, and from the 
sensations the woman&#39;s tongue was bringing her.

Miranda&#39;s determination not to stop continued, however, holding her hand 
still so that Samantha&#39;s back and forth motions would drag the woman&#39;s 
clit across her fingers by itself, Miranda pushed the vibrator deeper as 
Samantha came towards her. As she felt it stop, refusing to go further, 
a tinge of guilt poked at Miranda&#39;s conscience, only to be quickly 
dispelled as Samantha suddenly buried her face in her pillow to muffle 
her exclamation, the woman&#39;s hips shaking as they both held still as 
best they could.

Almost absently, Miranda noticed that Erika&#39;s tongue had slipped away 
and knew that her other lover was watching. With a small mischievous 
grin, Miranda watched Samantha hang on the brink for a moment more 
before her fingers parted, pushing upwards to entrap the woman&#39;s clit 
before squeezing it gently. 

Samantha&#39;s reaction was instantaneous. As the woman&#39;s body shook almost 
violently, Miranda had to grit her teeth to hold the vibrator steady, 
Samantha&#39;s inner walls threatening to force it back out as she grabbed 
the edges of the pillow to support herself. With a strange feeling of 
exhilaration, Miranda eased the pressure of her fingers upon Samantha&#39;s 
clit before wriggling them slightly; caressing the nub with a gentleness 
that was almost in contrast to way the woman&#39;s body was shaking.

Samantha responded by suddenly stiffening, her body holding nearly 
completely still for a long moment, the woman holding her breath before 
suddenly lifting her head from the pillow and letting it out again and 
pulling forward. Falling forward onto the bed and crawling a little 
further up it to leave Miranda holding the glistening vibrator with an 
amused expression upon her face as Samantha lie before her panting to 
catch her breath. 

A moment later, and Miranda felt Erika&#39;s arms around her once more, the 
woman having extricated herself in order to kneel just behind the 
courier once more. &quot;She&#39;s exaggerating a little, but for the most part 
that was your doing,&quot; the Gym Leader whispered into Miranda&#39;s ear, 
soliciting a quiet, embarrassed giggle.

Miranda nodded slowly, watching as Samantha rolled over onto her back 
and smiled up at the girl, her arms extended towards Miranda invitingly. 
&quot;Surely I&#39;m not that good!&quot; the courier blurted, causing Samantha to 
laugh as she sat up and wrapped her arms around Miranda.

&quot;Certainly good enough to make sure I&#39;ll prolly sleep for a week 
straight,&quot; the redhead assured, her hands running up Erika&#39;s back as 
Miranda found herself held by both women, if not a little awkwardly, 
&quot;but how about you? How do you feel?&quot;

Miranda paused for moment, catching the seriousness in the woman&#39;s tone. 
&quot;Kind of exhilarated,&quot; she replied slowly, trying unsuccessfully to hide 
her smile, &quot;I don&#39;t think I could sleep if my life depended on it!&quot;

Samantha exchanged a look with her mentor and smiled, her gaze returning 
Miranda. &quot;My goodness but you&#39;re delightfully insatiable!&quot; the woman 
chuckled, smiling as she saw the look on Miranda&#39;s face, &quot;But 
unfortunately, I&#39;m not...&quot;

Miranda gave a bit of pout as Samantha slipped away and swung her legs 
off the bed. &quot;I&#39;ll be back in a few minutes,&quot; the woman promised with a 
weary smile, struggling to stand upon her wobbling legs, &quot;I&#39;ll bring 
back some fresh tea as well. The last batch is sure to be long since 
cooled by now.&quot;

Miranda glanced over her shoulder as Samantha slipped a robe about her 
shoulders before stepping out into the hallway, feeling suddenly 
conscious of the fact that she was suddenly alone with Erika. &quot;I, I hope 
you don&#39;t mind me saying this,&quot; the courier said hesitantly, leaning 
back against the woman&#39;s warm body, enjoying the feeling of the 
reassuring hug Erika gave her, &quot;but you two have a rather peculiar 
relationship.&quot;

Erika chuckled lightly in the courier&#39;s ear, giving Miranda&#39;s neck a 
soft kiss before her arms began to slip away. &quot;It more than likely 
wouldn&#39;t work even half as well for anyone else,&quot; she assured, coming 
around to the front before lying back down upon the bed&#39;s ruffled 
sheets, &quot;we do care for one another, make no mistake. It is simply that 
there are some lessons that can only be taught in an intimate setting. 
To be honest, we don&#39;t normally pursue other lovers we don&#39;t intend on 
&#39;sharing&#39;. But here are times when a little self-indulgence is 
permissible.&quot;

Miranda&#39;s eyes widened as she stared down at Erika&#39;s naked form for a 
moment, her pulse raising, her emotions feeling a bit conflicted as she 
nervously wet her lips. &quot;I, I really don&#39;t think I could settle for 
that,&quot; the girl confessed, a tinge of guilt making her wince as Miranda 
became fearful of offending her hostess, &quot;I think that I&#39;d like to make 
my next relationship as serious and meaningful as possible. Not that 
yours doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s just-&quot;

Erika&#39;s reassuring smile cut her off, the look in the woman&#39;s mysterious 
emerald eyes causing Miranda to catch her breath. &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid to 
speak your mind, Miri,&quot; the Gym Leader assured, patting the bed beside 
her, &quot;I&#39;ve always found honesty to be a rather refreshing trait; there 
are far too many lies and half-truths in the world. It&#39;s one of the 
reasons I&#39;ve become so adept at knowing the feelings of others.&quot;

Miranda blushed again, using the excuse of lying down to let her hair 
fall forward to hide her expression, knowing full well that Erika could 
sense her continued desire, and the courier&#39;s deep attraction to the 
woman.

&quot;You&#39;ve nothing to be embarrassed about, my dear,&quot; Erika said at last as 
Miranda lay upon her side facing the woman, the space between them 
seeming all to vast and infinite, only to be bridged as Erika&#39;s hand 
touched the girl&#39;s shoulder softly, &quot;To be honest, I&#39;d like to continue 
this for a bit longer, with just you. That&#39;s part of the reason Samantha 
went out. She&#39;s really become quite intuitive...&quot;

Miranda glanced up at the woman, her expression a bit nervous as the 
feel of Erika&#39;s touch sent a curiously warm feeling through her. &quot;I, I 
kinda know the feeling,&quot; she replied hesitantly, the courier&#39;s smile 
only partially suppressed, &quot;Well, the continuing on part, anyway. I 
guess Samantha was right, I am a bit insatiable.&quot;

Erika chuckled softly, sliding her arm around Miranda and moving closer, 
her leg sliding over the courier&#39;s, soliciting a small, pleasant shiver 
from Miranda at the closeness of their contact. &quot;So it&#39;s alright with 
you then?&quot; Erika inquired softly, the end of her nose brushing against 
Miranda&#39;s, &quot;You&#39;d like to make love to me?&quot;

Miranda swallowed down her nervousness, finding it difficult to speak, 
and nodding her reply, finding it far easier to move her face a little 
closer and press her lips lightly against Erika&#39;s rather than speak. Her 
lover responded in kind, the woman sighing softly, her hand moving up 
across Miranda&#39;s arm, over her should and neck to hold Miranda&#39;s face 
fondly for a moment.

&quot;You&#39;re going to make someone very happy one day, Miri,&quot; whispered Erika 
breathlessly, her fingers sliding up through the girl&#39;s hair, her smile 
becoming a little amused as Erika&#39;s fingers became snagged in its 
tangles.

&quot;When you say that, I can almost believe its true,&quot; Miranda replied, 
chuckling a bit as Erika finally had to simply slide her hand back 
entirely to retrieve her fingers from the courier&#39;s hair.

&quot;Nearly anything&#39;s possible, deary,&quot; Erika assured, the tips of her 
middle and index fingers gently tracing Miranda&#39;s jaw line, savoring her 
skin&#39;s softness, &quot;Even if you don&#39;t believe it is, I&#39;ll leave this world 
a very surprised woman if you don&#39;t find someone else more worthy to 
love.&quot;

&quot;I just hope you&#39;re a very old woman when you finally do, though,&quot; added 
Miranda teasingly with a bit of a giggle, slipping her arm around Erika 
as her confidence grew.

Erika closed her eyes and chuckled, nodding slowly in agreement. &quot;That&#39;s 
something you can count upon,&quot; she assured, her fingers sliding under 
Miranda&#39;s chin to lift it slightly before kissing the girl lightly 
again, &quot;but just now, I&#39;d much rather concentrate on the present. For I 
doubt very much that I shall have this privilege again any time soon.&quot;

Miranda closed her eyes and pressed her lips against Erika&#39;s to hide her 
reaction to the woman&#39;s words, feeling nearly unable to contain herself, 
trusting in Erika&#39;s sincerity that they were true. As her kiss was 
eagerly returned, Miranda felt the fingers of Erika&#39;s free hand link 
with her own, giving the courier&#39;s hand a reassuring squeeze as 
Miranda&#39;s other hand moved to gently touch Erika&#39;s breast.

&quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; the woman said softly as their lips parted, leaving 
Miranda breathless as Erika&#39;s own free hand slid downward once again, 
her fingers moving teasingly over Miranda&#39;s breasts each in turn, &quot;You 
needn&#39;t be afraid to touch me.&quot;

Miranda let out a bit of a self-conscious chuckle as she opened her eyes 
and looked into Erika&#39;s, her fingers running experimentally across her 
lover&#39;s breast, the feeling of Erika&#39;s soft skin sending pleasant chills 
through the courier. 

&quot;So long as you know that that applies to me as well,&quot; Miranda chuckled 
teasingly, blushing at her words and gasping as she felt Erika&#39;s fingers 
entrap one of her nipples between them.

&quot;Actually,&quot; said Erika thoughtfully, her lips coming teasingly close to 
Miranda&#39;s as she spoke, occasionally brushing lightly against them, &quot;I&#39;d 
like to believe that I&#39;m becoming quite adept at knowing your limits and 
avoiding them.&quot;

The courier sighed contentedly, her fingers coiling so that their tips 
dragged lightly across Erika&#39;s breast, stopping as they touched the hard 
nub of the woman&#39;s nipple. &quot;You haven&#39;t scared me off yet,&quot; Miranda 
assured with a chuckle, glancing down to watch her fingers as they ran 
lightly over what they had found.

&quot;I could never forgive myself if I did,&quot; assured Erika, inhaling slowly, 
her eyes half-lidded as two of Miranda&#39;s fingers slowly moved to entrap 
her nipple, gently rotating it slightly as the girl glanced up to gauge 
Erika&#39;s reaction, smiling as she caught the slightly unfocused look in 
her lover&#39;s eyes. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry too much,&quot; Miranda assured softly, slowly releasing the 
hardened nub before moving her hand lower, the courier&#39;s fingers slowly 
tracing a path down over Erika&#39;s stomach, &quot;I&#39;m beginning to doubt you 
ever could.&quot;

As they passed her navel, Erika couldn&#39;t help but glance down, absently 
nibbling her bottom lip as Miranda&#39;s slightly shaking fingers slid 
slowly across the soft warmth of her womanhood, the courier&#39;s body 
giving a bit of a shiver at the contact. Erika glanced up just as 
Miranda looked at her, their eyes meeting for what seemed like an 
eternity before Erika moved closer, pressing her lips gently against the 
courier&#39;s.

Miranda sighed softly in response, thankful that she wasn&#39;t standing as 
Erika&#39;s show of affection made her body seem to melt, her hand 
momentarily leaving the soft feel of her lover&#39;s womanhood. &quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; 
Miranda could hear Erika whisper, their lips barely parting as the woman 
spoke, her gentle hand suddenly covering her own, coaxing it back to its 
former placement.

The courier nodded slowly, taking a slow deep breath before opening her 
eyes and smiling shyly back at Erika, allowing the woman to guide her 
hand as she felt her lover&#39;s fingers slide over her own. Miranda then 
watched intently, looking deeply into Erika&#39;s eyes for signs of reaction 
to their joined movements.

As Erika bending her leg at the knee to provide her with more room to 
move, Miranda let the woman coax her fingers into moving slowly up and 
down Erika&#39;s labia, causing her lover&#39;s body to give a small, sudden 
shiver that made the courier smile.

&quot;You okay?&quot; Miranda teased with a bit of a giggle in her voice, 
receiving a bemused smile from Erika as she pushed the girl&#39;s fingers 
closer together in response, causing Miranda to catch her breath as she 
felt a warm wetness upon them.

&quot;That would depend on your definition &#39;okay&#39;,&quot; Erika replied, gently 
nibbling her lip as she shifted her fingers slightly, coaxing the 
courier&#39;s fingers slightly until Miranda caught her breath, feeling her 
finger slide between Erika&#39;s labia, &quot;Now then, are you &#39;okay&#39;?&quot;

Miranda blushed, bowing her head as she tried unsuccessfully not to 
smile, nodding slightly and moving her fingers lightly back and forth, 
finding the meager resistance of her lover&#39;s inner walls quickly 
dissipating under her touch. Glancing up, the girl caught Erika&#39;s soft 
smile, readily accepting a gentle kiss upon her forehead as her lover&#39;s 
hand slipped away.

&quot;I think so,&quot; Miranda said softly, her fingers moving without the 
woman&#39;s coaxing, two of them caressing Erika&#39;s labia as the one between 
them pushed a little deeper.

&quot;That&#39;s good to know,&quot; Erika breathed, her body giving a small shiver, 
the woman composing herself a moment later before touching Miranda&#39;s 
hand gently once again. &quot;Just a moment, deary,&quot; said Erika softly, her 
smile banishing the sudden concern that made Miranda&#39;s heart sink as the 
woman moved onto her back and motioned the courier closer.

&quot;S-sorry- I mean-&quot; Miranda stammered without thinking as she pulled her 
hand away and sat up on her side, bowing her head to hide an embarrassed 
smile.

Erika chuckled softly in reply, her hand gliding fondly downward, 
caressing the girl&#39;s neck, shoulder and arm. &quot;You&#39;re still a bit 
nervous,&quot; she said softly, her hand slipping down further to hold 
Miranda&#39;s, &quot;Is there anything I can do fix that?&quot;

Miranda glanced up, wetting her dry lips as she moved into a sitting 
position and gave Erika&#39;s hand a reassuring squeeze. &quot;It&#39;s silly,&quot; she 
replied, glancing away as she spoke, &quot;But I&#39;m actually finding being 
alone with you a little... I don&#39;t know. Like I&#39;m putting more pressure 
on myself to impress you.&quot; Miranda looked back down into Erika&#39;s eyes, 
giving the woman a self-conscious smile. &quot;See? It&#39;s silly.&quot;

Erika merely shook her head slowly, her emerald eyes seeming to fill 
with unwavering concern as Erika reached out with both arms to hold 
Miranda. &quot;No, not at all,&quot; the woman said softly as the courier lied 
down on her side once again, this time slipping an arm around Erika, her 
head resting upon the woman&#39;s chest, just above her bosom, &quot;I find it 
rather endearing, actually.&quot;

Miranda let out a short, self-conscious chuckle, sighing softly as she 
felt Erika&#39;s fingers running affectionately through her hair as best 
they could. &quot;There you go again,&quot; the girl chuckled, lifting her head as 
she moved over Erika&#39;s body, bending her knees to support herself upon 
her shins and forearms, the courier&#39;s story gray eyes full of amusement 
as she looked down into the twin seas of emerald green that were 
Erika&#39;s, &quot;increasing the size of my ego.&quot;

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry,&quot; assured Erika, her bemused smile widening as she 
moved Miranda&#39;s hair away from the girl&#39;s face with both hands, &quot;I&#39;ll be 
sure to stop once you&#39;ve gained the right confidence, and not turn you 
into an egomaniac.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d appreciate that,&quot; Miranda replied with a giggle, giving Erika&#39;s 
lips a quick, teasing kiss before moving down a little further, pushing 
her nervousness away once again. Trusting Erika to make her aware the 
instant she did something wrong, and trying not to think of it too much, 
Miranda nuzzled the woman&#39;s neck affectionately, finding the intense 
softness of Erika&#39;s skin almost impossible to resist.

A heartbeat later, Erika&#39;s fingers continued to play through the 
courier&#39;s midnight locks, the woman sighing contentedly and leaning her 
head back as Miranda&#39;s lips tentatively kissed their way down Erika&#39;s 
neck. Proceeding further, Miranda shuffled slowly downwards, letting out 
the occasional short, stifled giggle at her own awkwardness as Erika 
pulled an extra pillow over to support herself.

Looking up as she came to Erika&#39;s bosom, Miranda gave her lover another 
nervous smile, looking into the woman&#39;s eyes as she took a deep breath 
and lightly took one of Erika&#39;s nipples between her lips, pulling on it 
gently and just enough to solicit a small, sudden shiver from Erika. 
Pleased with the result, Miranda let her growing confidence wear down at 
the walls of her uncertainty, unwilling to allow the opportunity to 
pass.

As she felt Erika&#39;s hands move her once more out of control hair back, 
brushing it with her fingers down Miranda&#39;s back and out of the way, the 
girl closed her eyes, holding her breath as she ran the tip of her 
tongue experimentally over the hardened nub of Erika&#39;s nipple. Feeling 
Erika&#39;s body tense as her lover arched her back, Miranda exhaled softly, 
opening her eyes to watch Erika&#39;s reactions as the tip of her tongue 
teasingly lapped at her nipple.

Much to her satisfaction, Erika&#39;s fingers coiled a little tighter as the 
woman looked back down at Miranda through half-lidded eyes, giving an 
ever so slight nod of approval as the courier drew a portion of Erika&#39;s 
breast into her mouth, suckling gently as her tongue explored the 
woman&#39;s soft skin and hard nipple. Miranda then slowly pulled back, 
suckling gently so that Erika&#39;s breast would gain its freedom only after 
a long moment which caused the woman to arch her back and hold her 
breath.

When at last she was free of the warmth of Miranda&#39;s mouth, Erika 
relaxed once more, exhaling loudly as she fell back down, her breathing 
steadying only long enough for Miranda&#39;s lips to move to her other 
breast. Erika sighed contentedly, closing her eyes as she felt Miranda&#39;s 
hand suddenly cup her now unoccupied breast, letting out a soft moan as 
she felt the courier&#39;s teeth nibble her gently as Miranda suckled 
insistently.

As Miranda&#39;s fingers played experimentally across her breast, Erika 
couldn&#39;t help but cover the girl&#39;s hand, pushing her fingers closer 
together as they entrapped her nipple, squeezing it tighter as Miranda 
suckled the other a little harder. At the increased sensation, Erika let 
out a small gasp, receiving a pleased chuckled from Miranda who pulled 
her lips back slowly once more, only to replace her mouth with her free 
hand.

Erika released the courier&#39;s hand as she moved lower, sliding her 
fingers through Miranda&#39;s hair once more as the girl paused and placed a 
teasing kiss upon Erika&#39;s navel. Lifting her head a little higher to 
watch, Erika held her breath, feeling Miranda&#39;s slightly parted lips 
running across her naked skin, the girl&#39;s hands shaking a bit as they 
adoringly caressed Erika&#39;s small bosom.

Miranda lifted her head slightly as she felt her shoulders rub against 
Erika&#39;s inner thighs, the woman bending her legs at the knees and trying 
to give her a bit more room to maneuver. Miranda then smiled up at 
Erika, the woman&#39;s face just on the edge of becoming slightly blurry as 
the courier felt thankful that her vision wasn&#39;t as bad as it could have 
been.  

&quot;Am I doing okay?&quot; Miranda inquired coyly, receiving a soft chuckle from 
Erika, the woman&#39;s hands sliding down to her cheeks, holding her face 
fondly.

&quot;Without question,&quot; Erika sighed happily, her hands sliding back up 
through Miranda&#39;s hair, subtly coaxing her lover to continue, &quot;Just 
listen to your instincts. Your body knows what do to.&quot;

Miranda nodded slowly, stifling a self-conscious chuckle as she pulled 
her hands back, releasing Erika&#39;s breasts and bringing her arms back to 
support herself better as she shuffled lower and got comfortable. &quot;I&#39;ll 
try and keep that in mind,&quot; the courier replied softly, swallowing her 
nervousness as she glanced back down at Erika&#39;s womanhood before 
lowering her head slowly.

As Erika&#39;s fingers played through her hair, reassuring her every step of 
the way, Miranda parted her lips and brushed them gently upwards against 
her lover&#39;s labia, giggling softly under her breath at the quiet gasp 
the woman let out at her touch. Bringing her lips back downwards, 
Miranda tentatively touched her tongue to the silky softness of Erika&#39;s 
skin, closing her eyes as the taste of the woman&#39;s excitement caused the 
courier to let out a quiet, joyous whimper before she could stop 
herself.

The feeling of Erika&#39;s fingertips pushing a little more insistently 
against her scalp brought Miranda back to reality a moment later, the 
girl letting her tongue slide lower, pushing its way between Erika&#39;s 
labia as it went. As she brought her tongue back upwards, collecting the 
sweet flavour of her lover&#39;s desire upon it, Miranda smiled inwardly, 
feeling Erika&#39;s body tense and knowing she was doing more than just 
&#39;okay&#39;.

The gratifying feeling that filled Miranda also increased her confidence 
in what she was doing, her nervousness and self-conscious concerns being 
pushed further and further away as the girl placed her hands upon 
Erika&#39;s thighs, gently caressing them with her fingers as her tongue 
began lapping slowly at Erika&#39;s womanhood.

Feeling her lover&#39;s fingers curl as the woman&#39;s inner walls seemed to 
tense, Miranda quickly covered Erika&#39;s labia with her mouth, pushing 
deeply with her tongue and suckling as the woman approached her peak. 
Closing her eyes with a feeling of gratified contentment, Miranda moaned 
softly, her tongue twisting its way deeper into Erika, her lover&#39;s body 
began to shake, the woman letting out a long, helpless whimper as she 
tried unsuccessfully to contain herself.

Miranda finally managed to open her eyes as she heard an excited gasp 
suddenly escape Erika&#39;s lips, and was surprised to see the woman&#39;s 
cheeks flushed, her mask of complete calm shattering as Erika lifted her 
head, gasping helplessly for breath as she clung almost desperately to 
Miranda&#39;s hair, somehow finding the will to ease her grip before causing 
her lover any real pain.

As Miranda watched, Erika seemed poised upon the brink, the woman 
swallowing hard as she panted, her whole body shaking as she tried to 
contain herself but obviously unable to for very much longer. &#39;Let go!&#39; 
Miranda urged inwardly, fighting the urge to smile as she watched Erika 
teeter at the precipice of sensual ecstasy, &#39;I promise not to tell 
anyone how beautiful you are when you do...&#39;

Erika&#39;s eyes suddenly flew open as Miranda pressed her mouth closer, the 
end of her nose brushing lightly against the woman&#39;s clit and causing 
Erika to catch her breath. Pressing her advantage, Miranda pulled her 
mouth away, panting as she then descended upon the hardened nub, her 
lips surrounding it with little room to spare as her tongue teasingly 
ran circles around Erika&#39;s clit without actually touching it.

&quot;M-Miranda!&quot; the woman gasped helplessly, her hands moving quickly to 
the courier&#39;s shoulders, gripping them tightly as she held her lover in 
place with her legs, &quot;D- Don&#39;t tease!&quot;

The courier couldn&#39;t help but smile happily at her handiwork, suddenly 
adding to Erika&#39;s sweet torment by running her fingertips down the 
length of the woman&#39;s labia before gently pressing the tip of her middle 
finger between them. Miranda then glanced up, catching the desperate 
look in Erika&#39;s eyes, the woman somehow finding the strength to give her 
a short nod before falling back down as the girl&#39;s finger made the same 
slow rotating movements that her tongue suddenly did upon Erika&#39;s clit.

Miranda barely felt Erika&#39;s nails as they pressed into her shoulders, 
the woman&#39;s hands pulling her closer, her legs wrapping about the 
courier&#39;s waist as Miranda&#39;s tongue pushed against her clit, rotating it 
wetly at the same time that her finger slid easily into Erika&#39;s wetness, 
only to be held in place as the woman&#39;s inner walls clenched tight once 
again.

Erika&#39;s voice then suddenly filled Miranda&#39;s ears, the woman letting out 
a long, helpless moan as she clung desperately to Miranda; her face 
flushing deeply as her body finally let go, her whole world centered 
upon the probing finger inside of her, and the way that Miranda suckled 
her clit as the girl&#39;s tongue caressed it.

It seemed to take forever for Erika&#39;s body to finally fall back onto the 
bed after arching her back almost painfully for several seconds. Even 
then, Miranda only pulled her head back slightly, panting as she 
continued circling Erika&#39;s clit with her tongue, the woman writhing 
beneath her, Erika&#39;s body shaking as it tried to unsuccessfully to come 
down.

&quot;W-Wait-!&quot; Erika gasped at last, laughing as she let go of Miranda&#39;s 
shoulders and held her face, lifting the girl&#39;s head only through the 
greatest of efforts, &quot;I- I need a moment...&quot;

Miranda, smiled as she saw the contented look upon Erika&#39;s face, the 
woman looking radiant as ever despite her somewhat dishevelled 
appearance. &quot;Sorry,&quot; the girl replied with a bit of a giggle, her hand 
slipping away from Erika&#39;s womanhood, &quot;I guess I just got a little 
carried away...&quot;

&quot;Goodness no! Not at all,&quot; Erika laughed, only partially regaining her 
composure as the woman struggled into a sitting position before 
motioning Miranda closer, &quot;If anything, it&#39;s me who should apologize. 
I&#39;m not normally quite so susceptible to another&#39;s touch. I&#39;m afraid 
that my desire for you seems to have gotten the better of me. Infact, 
I&#39;d say that it&#39;s still doing just that.&quot;

Miranda&#39;s eyes widened, at the comment, finding it hard to hide her 
blushing smile as she got her legs under herself and sat before the 
woman. &quot;What exactly do you mean?&quot; Miranda inquired carefully, almost 
feeling Erika&#39;s continued desire in the air between them.

Erika bowed her head slightly and leaned forward, her neatly trimmed, 
ebon bangs partially obscuring the woman&#39;s compelling emerald eyes. &quot;I 
mean both that I&#39;ve yet to have my fill of you, and that it seems 
somehow unfair that I&#39;ve yet to return the favour,&quot; Erika replied, 
leaning closer until her nose brushed against Miranda&#39;s her lips so 
close that the courier could feel them occasionally brushing against her 
own as the woman spoke, &quot;Assuming, of course, that you&#39;re still up for 
this.&quot;

&quot;H-How could I not be?&quot; Miranda stammered rhetorically, her body shaking 
inperceptively as she spoke, her voice becoming quiet, the warmth of 
Erika&#39;s breath upon her lips making them quiver as the girl&#39;s eyes slid 
closed.

Miranda could then feel Erika&#39;s hands slide slowly over her naked 
shoulders, the woman&#39;s fingers gently caressing them to make up for the 
unnoticed injury she&#39;d inadvertently caused earlier. &quot;Are you willing to 
try something just a little different, then?&quot; she whispered, &quot;Because to 
be honest, deary, I simply must have a little more of you, and I can&#39;t 
abide by the thought of being completely selfish about it.&quot;

Miranda caught her breath and moved quickly forward, her arms slipping 
around Erika, holding her tightly as the girl nuzzled her lover&#39;s neck, 
her lips moving slowly up to Erika&#39;s ear. &quot;Anything, anything at all...&quot; 
Miranda whispered breathlessly, putting her forehead upon Erika&#39;s 
shoulder as she felt the woman&#39;s hands moving slowly down her back, 
caressing her muscles soothingly.

&quot;Never promise that, Miri,&quot; the woman replied with a touch of 
seriousness in her voice as pushed Miranda&#39;s hair away and gave her 
earlobe a gentle kiss, &quot;You have limits. Always make sure your lovers 
respect them, okay?&quot; 

The courier nodded slowly, Erika&#39;s words bringing reality a little 
closer, but not close enough to intrude upon her mood. &quot;I promise,&quot; 
Miranda assured, lifting her head and kissing Erika&#39;s lips softly, a 
slight giggle entering her voice, &quot;Now please, show me what it is you 
had in mind so I can decide whether or not I object to it, okay?&quot;

Erika chuckled softly, running her fingers fondly through Miranda&#39;s hair 
as best she could. &quot;As you wish,&quot; the woman replied softly, her hand 
running back down Miranda&#39;s cheek before placing both hands upon the 
courier&#39;s shoulders once again and giving her a gentle, coaxing push, 
&quot;Now, just lie down. And remember to say something if you don&#39;t like it, 
okay?&quot;

Miranda nodded slowly, her smile a bit nervous as she complied, 
half-wondering just how far Erika herself was willing to go, and what 
other secretive pleasures she sought out on a regular basis with 
Samantha, but was still as yet reluctant to bring up with the courier. 
The thought made Miranda&#39;s smile deepen as she stretched her legs out, 
watching curiously as Erika moved to one side, watching her just as 
intently.

&quot;You&#39;re very pretty, Miranda,&quot; whispered Erika, her voice quiet yet 
sincere, causing the courier to turn her head away to hide her 
embarrassed smile as the woman moved onto her hands and knees before 
maneuvering herself overtop of her lover.

Glancing back, Miranda let out a short, stammered reply, quickly 
quieting as her eyes widened, understanding for the most part what Erika 
had in mind as the woman slowly lowered herself.

&quot;Everything, okay?&quot; Erika inquired seriously, only to receive a quiet 
chuckle from Miranda.

&quot;Perfectly,&quot; the girl responded, if not a little nervously, finding the 
warm softness of Erika&#39;s body against her own comforting and reassuring 
despite her conflicted feelings of desire and embarrassment at the 
thought of anyone walking into the room at that moment.

&quot;Good, I&#39;m glad,&quot; said Erika, breathing a soft sigh as she cuddled 
closer, her legs bent at the knees, pressing against the girl&#39;s sides as 
Miranda moved her arms out of the way before Erika slowly lowered her 
head to give Miranda&#39;s inner thigh a teasing kiss.

The courier caught her breath at the sensation, her hands suddenly 
holding Erika&#39;s thighs almost instinctively for support, knowing full 
well what her lover had in mind. For a moment, Miranda kept still, her 
fingers shaking as she moved her legs a little further apart, her mind 
focused solely upon the warm wetness of Erika&#39;s tongue as its tip slid 
slowly up her thigh, only to feel the woman&#39;s lips kiss their way back 
down the other.

Her body then tensing as she felt her need for Erika increase 
dramatically, causing Miranda to hold her breath a moment longer, 
finally letting it go raggedly as she felt the woman&#39;s lips kiss their 
way down her opposite thigh. Opening her eyes, Miranda wet her lips 
nervously, the sight of Erika&#39;s womanhood glistening with desire filling 
her vision. Then, before she could ask, Miranda felt a pillow pressed 
against her shoulder as Erika pulled one back for her.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Miranda chuckled, taking a moment to fold the pillow in half 
and pull it behind her head to support herself without fear of neck 
strain before running her hands up the backs of Erika&#39;s thighs, smiling 
to herself as she heard the woman let out a soft, contented sigh.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Erika murmured, lowering her head once again and 
giving Miranda&#39;s labia a soft, adoring kiss before teasing the line 
between them with the end of her tongue, causing Miranda&#39;s body to give 
a sudden, small shiver that made the girl giggle self-consciously.

Taking a calming breath to compose herself Miranda let her hands slide 
up all the way to Erika&#39;s bottom, smiling to herself as she gave it an 
appraising squeeze, her own body giving another inadvertent shiver at 
firmness of it. &#39;I guess there&#39;s a lot more to Erika than there seems,&#39; 
the courier thought inwardly, chuckling at the foolishness of the 
thought, for despite her time with the woman, Miranda was well aware 
that Erika still withheld many secrets, &#39;She must do some of the 
landscaping work here herself. Lead by example I guess...&#39;

Miranda&#39;s reverie was broken as she felt Erika&#39;s tongue push a little 
deeper as it slid slowly, almost casually up and down between her labia 
before drawing back and licking each one in turn, moistening Miranda&#39;s 
skin with her own warm wetness. Taking it as something of a challenge, 
the courier pressed her tongue deeply into Erika&#39;s womanhood once more, 
suckling gently as her fingers squeezed a little harder, causing Erika 
to lift up a bit, offering herself more completely to the courier.

Taking advantage of the moment, Miranda drew her tongue back, sliding it 
slowly down between Erika&#39;s labia before dragging its way the short 
distance to her clit, Erika then closed her eyes, concentrating on the 
sensation of the girl&#39;s tongue swirling about her clit. Concentrating on 
the sensation, Erika lowered her head and copied Miranda&#39;s movements, 
drawing her tongue up between the girl&#39;s labia before caressing the 
courier&#39;s clit with her tongue.

Quickly realizing what Erika was doing, Miranda couldn&#39;t help but smile, 
getting a small thrill out of directing her lover&#39;s movements. Sliding 
her hands down and around Erika&#39;s thighs, Miranda pulled her lover a 
little closer, her lips carefully encircling the woman&#39;s clit, gently 
suckling it as her tongue continued its work.

For her part, Erika mostly copied Miranda&#39;s movements; pleased to feel 
the girl&#39;s body quiver at the sensation as her the tip of her tongue 
barely touched the hard nub of Miranda&#39;s clit, teasing it gently as 
Miranda&#39;s concentration began to slip. As the girl let out a quiet 
whimper, Erika&#39;s hands moved slowly up Miranda&#39;s legs before the fingers 
of her right hand lightly brushed across the courier&#39;s glistening 
womanhood, causing her body to jump a little at the sudden sensation.

As her lover&#39;s lips momentarily slipped away to catch her breath, Erika 
suckled Miranda&#39;s clit a little harder, her lips closing in on it before 
lifting off of it. At the same time, the woman&#39;s index finger dipped 
cautiously into Miranda&#39;s womanhood, easily slipping past her labia, and 
meeting little resistance to the intrusion. With a gently circling 
motion, Erika pushed deeper, rubbing her finger gently against Miranda&#39;s 
inner walls as the tip of her tongue continued to press lightly against 
the courier&#39;s clit, making slow, small circles atop of it and causing 
the girl&#39;s body to tense up until Miranda could barely move against the 
building sensation.

Despite the increasing tension, and the girl&#39;s obvious desire for her to 
quicken the pace, Erika merely smiled inwardly as she continued her slow 
pace. Her tongue&#39;s movements changed only marginally, occasionally 
slipping down to the base of Miranda&#39;s clit as her tongue&#39;s already slow 
circling eased its pace further, the woman&#39;s touch becoming teasingly 
lighter. All the while Erika&#39;s free hand held Miranda&#39;s leg in place 
against the way she was beginning to squirm as the woman&#39;s index finger 
began a slow back and forth motion, pushing a little deeper with each 
forward movement as Miranda&#39;s body eagerly eased its passage.

Meanwhile, Miranda finally threw her head back into her pillow, her back 
arching against the reassuring warmth of Erika&#39;s body as her arms fell 
heavily onto the bed, her fingers curling to grab roughly at the bed 
sheets. Gritting her teeth against the building pressure, the girl 
squeezed her eyes closed, finally reminding herself that it was okay, 
that they were alone, in a room that seemed fairly soundproof, and that 
she was with someone who wouldn&#39;t find any kind of an outburst she might 
make to be silly or foolish. Infact, a part of the courier&#39;s 
consciousness reminded herself, Erika had found Miranda in the throws of 
ecstasy to be quite beautiful.

Gasping out the breath she&#39;d been holding, Miranda panted heavily, 
letting the waves of sensation slowly build inside of her as she made 
little effort to keep still. As Erika&#39;s finger curled, dragging itself 
back and forth against in a curiously pleasurable way, Miranda&#39;s inner 
walls suddenly pushed together, the girl&#39;s panting stopping as she let 
out a long, surprised gasp that increased quickly in pitch until it was 
almost inaudible. 

Falling back down onto the bed a moment later, Miranda&#39;s hips squirmed 
almost of their own accord as the girl gasped for breath, not caring if 
the whole world heard her as Miranda felt the building tension suddenly 
let go all at once. The courier&#39;s surprised gasp quickly became a 
desperate cry of passion as Miranda all but emptied her lungs, her body 
shaking as the girl arched her back once more, her fists hitting the 
mattress almost of the own accord in an attempt to force out the 
feeling.

Erika didn&#39;t let up, however, instead quickly encircling Miranda&#39;s clit 
with her lips and suckling against it insistently, her finger quickening 
its pace as the woman&#39;s tongue pushed a little harder, but continued its 
small, tight circles. 

When at last she suddenly heard Miranda&#39;s voice give out, leaving the 
girl panting, Erika began to slow her pace once more, only to be 
surprised a moment later by the feeling of Miranda&#39;s tongue lapping 
desperately at her labia. Lifting her head and exhaling slowly, a smile 
slowly crept across Erika&#39;s face; the woman&#39;s thumb moving to Miranda&#39;s 
clit to replace her now weary tongue, the digit making similar, if not 
somewhat gentler motions upon the hard nub. 

&quot;You&#39;re going to make someone so very happy...&quot; Erika murmured softly, 
her voice almost a sensuous purr as her ears caught the faintest sound 
of the door being quietly unlatched.

Looking back over her shoulder, Erika smiled as she saw her apprentice 
slip quietly into the room, the woman bringing with her a tray with 
fresh tea and a plate of shortbread cookies. The two exchanged a quick 
glance before Erika turned away, trusting Samantha to understand, and 
was pleased as she heard the quiet sounds of the tray being set down, 
followed by the faint rustle of the woman&#39;s robe falling quietly to the 
floor.

As Erika&#39;s tender touch continued to keep her from completely coming 
down, Miranda&#39;s head fell back, the girl panting once again as she began 
to wonder just how much more she could take. It was then that caught 
sight of someone standing at the foot of the bed, the girl&#39;s stormy gray 
eyes widening as the blurry image cleared and she noticed the now 
familiar mischievous grin upon Samantha&#39;s face as the woman crawled onto 
the bed.

&quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind,&quot; the redhead chuckled, her accent adding a 
certain sultriness to her tone that somehow pushed away Miranda&#39;s sudden 
embarrassment, the girl catching Samantha off guard as the courier&#39;s 
hands reached out towards her.

Samantha&#39;s smile became less humorous and more pleased as she felt 
Miranda&#39;s hand touch her lightly, beckoning the woman closer. Catching 
the hungry look in the courier&#39;s eyes, Samantha couldn&#39;t resist leaning 
down and kissing Miranda softly upon the lips before lifting up again 
and sighing contentedly as her drew her tongue across Erika&#39;s wetted 
labia.

At her apprentice&#39;s touch, Erika&#39;s body tensed, the woman holding her 
breath as Samantha chuckled softly. &quot;Mind if I help you out a bit, 
dear?&quot; she inquired coyly, receiving a blushing nod from Miranda in 
response.

Lying half on and half off the bed, Samantha gave Miranda a small nod, 
glancing significantly at Erika&#39;s womanhood, and making the girl&#39;s 
cheeks flush a little redder. &quot;This is crazy,&quot; Miranda giggled, smiling 
as Samantha tried not to laugh as she went back to lapping slowly at 
Erika&#39;s womanhood until Miranda caught on fully and wriggled the tip of 
her tongue against Erika&#39;s clit.

The woman&#39;s response was almost immediate, with only the slightest delay 
as Erika leaned far back, pushing against the bed with her hands and 
pushing her bottom out towards both her lovers. For a half-second, the 
woman tried to speak, but her words abandoned Erika at that moment, 
leaving the woman to utter a series of panting gasps before tilting her 
head back and taking a long, deep breath.

For what seemed like forever, Erika held her breath, her body shaking as 
she tried to contain herself a moment longer, savouring the moment until 
at last she simply couldn&#39;t take it any more. With an exclamation that 
made both Miranda and Samantha suppress giggles of amusement Erika 
dropped her head forward, her eyes held tightly shut as she gasped for 
breath, the woman slowly sliding back down overtop of Miranda.

Burying her face in the bed sheets between Miranda&#39;s thighs, Erika clung 
helplessly to the girl&#39;s legs, hugging them as her body continued to 
convulse for several moments as she rode out the sensation. 

When it at last began to fade, Erika was surprised to find herself 
unusually mentally and physically exhausted despite the grin she felt 
etched upon her face. Shaking her head slowly, the woman did her best to 
compose herself, regaining some semblance of control before lifting her 
face from its most undignified position. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to ask this,&quot; the woman said softly between deep breaths, 
&quot;But would it alright if someone rolled me over? I... I can&#39;t seem to 
find the strength to move, and I&#39;d hate to squish poor Miri.&quot;

With a laugh Miranda simply pushed to one side, only needing a bit of 
help from Samantha before she found herself atop of Erika. Continuing 
her motion, the courier quickly rolled off the woman and somehow found 
the strength to pull herself into a sitting position.

&quot;You okay?&quot; the girl inquired with a sheepish grin, brushing back her 
bangs as she looked down at Erika, finding Erika&#39;s rather helpless look 
with her limbs splayed out in all directions and her short dark hair 
badly dishevelled somehow still quite appealing.

&quot;I&#39;m frightfully dehydrated, but I should be okay,&quot; assured Erika with a 
small, embarrassed smile, lifting her hand slowly to wipe the sweat from 
her brow as Samantha and Miranda came up on either side of her, holding 
the woman close, keeping her warm as perspiration cooled Erika&#39;s skin.

&quot;The tea&#39;ll be brewed soon, dear,&quot; assured Samantha with a quiet 
chuckle, affectionately brushing Erika&#39;s bangs back from her face before 
kissing the woman softly, &quot;but I think you might want to rest a bit 
first. You both look like you could use it.&quot;

Miranda, her head resting upon Erika&#39;s shoulder frowned thoughtfully at 
the comment. &quot;Actually,&quot; she pondered, glancing up at Samantha, 
surprised by the way she felt after everything that had transpired, &quot;I 
feel kinda hyper. Dehydrated and suddenly famished, but not... Tired. 
I&#39;m guess I&#39;m just a bit odd.&quot;

&quot;I prefer &#39;unique&#39;, Erika replied, glancing over with just her eyes, her 
smile as full of fondness as her tone, &quot;But tell us. Other than that, 
how do you feel? About everything.&quot;

Miranda remained silent for a moment, turning over her thoughts in her 
mind, examining the deeply satisfied feeling she felt despite the 
questions that still floating amongst her many thoughts. &quot;I liked it,&quot; 
the girl replied thoughtfully, her tone sincere if not a little distant, 
&quot;It was a lot of fun. I just hope everything&#39;s okay between you two 
after this... I&#39;d hate to cause any problems...&quot;

&quot;No, no, Miri, don&#39;t worry about that,&quot; assured Erika sincerely though 
cryptically, reaching over to run her fingers over the courier&#39;s hair 
reassuringly, &quot;Life is never as simple as it seems on the outside.&quot;

The courier nodded slowly, considering the woman&#39;s words for a moment, 
glancing up as she almost felt Samantha smiling at her. &quot;Just accept 
that this Gym is quite often a world in of itself,&quot; she replied, almost 
copying her mentor&#39;s tone despite her accent and usually far more 
bemused manner of speaking, &quot;Just know that you&#39;ve done nothing to 
jeopardize what Erika and myself have, and know that whatever 
relationship decisions you make after leaving here should be yours, and 
yours alone. We want to help you, Miranda, but not influence you too 
much.&quot;

Miranda closed her eyes, sighing as she nodded in understanding. &quot;You&#39;re 
saying that what&#39;s paradise for one person, isn&#39;t necessarily that for 
another,&quot; the girl concluded, her brow furrowing thoughtfully, &quot;that 
though some might find your relationship a bit odd, it works for you. 
Although to be honest, it&#39;s not the sort of thing that&#39;d work for me... 
I think- No, I know, I need just one someone, completely to myself... 
Assuming I&#39;m ever in a relationship again...&quot;

&quot;You will, Miranda Lilcamp,&quot; promised Erika almost sadly, &quot;Trust me, you 
will...</pre>
