<p>&quot;Tell who what?&quot;</p>
<p>Ash shook his head in disappointment.   He sat down next to Zoey and said, &quot;Don't play dumb with me, woman!   I'm talking about you and Dawn! I know you have it in for her! Ever   since what happened at that last contest-&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey placed her hand over Ash's mouth   before he could finish speaking. &quot;Do you want Dawn to hear you?&quot;   she hissed, her eyes glancing over at the other girl's bedroom door.   Ash moved Zoey's hand away and whispered, &quot;Look, let's just go   out on the roof, okay? We can talk there...&quot; <br />
</p>
<p>The moment Zoey walked out onto the   roof, she realized she could finally breathe again. &quot;God, your   apartment room smells like crap...&quot; Zoey panted as she took in   a deep breath of air. Ash nodded and pulled out a cigarette and a lighter   from his pocket. &quot;This is my favorite place in this whole stinkin'   hotel...&quot; he replied casually. </p>
<p>Once Zoey finally freed her nostrils   of that awful stench, she asked, &quot;So...what's this you say about   me and Dawn?&quot; Ash slipped his cigarette in between his lips as   he said, &quot;I know you like her, okay? Ever since that last contest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it...really that obvious?&quot;   Zoey asked, her cheeks turning bright red.</p>
<p>Ash nodded and removed the cigarette   from his mouth so he could blow out a small puff of smoke. A small smirk   formed on his lips when he said, &quot;Also...I think Dawn might like   you too...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How do you know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, when I was shaking your   hand earlier, I gave you 'the flirting glare' to see if Dawn would react.   It just so happened that she did! However, I'm not entirely sure on   the matter...&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey couldn't believe what she was   hearing. &quot;YOU WANT ME AND DAWN TO HOOK UP?&quot; she cried, giving   Ash a incredulous look. Ash grinned sheepishly and replied, &quot;Well,   what else do you expect me to do? I can't return home to her yet...I   still need to find a way to make it up to her...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you talking about?&quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly, Ash had a sad thoughtful   look on his face, like he was remembering days long past. Sighing, Ash   said, &quot;I'm talking about a girl named Misty. I hurt her long ago   and she still hasn't forgiven me. I really love her, I do, but I want   to make it up to her. I want her to know that she's special to me and   that I DO care for her...&quot;</p>
<p>Wanting to use this situation as a   way to divert from the talk about her love for Dawn, Zoey decided to   ask Ash some more about this 'Misty' girl. &quot;When did you last see   her, anyway?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>Ash shook his head sadly and let out   a sigh. 'God, he sighs alot!' Zoey thought. Ash looked up at the starry   sky and said:</p>
<p>&quot;The last time we ever saw each   other was at that last contest...&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey was a little surprised, but she   didn't let this unwind her. 'So...it seems that the last contest was   the beginning of all our miseries! Who would have thought?'</p>
<p>After a few moments of silence, Ash   said, &quot;If you want, Zoey, I can help you hook up with Dawn...&quot;</p>
<p>It didn't take long for Zoey to consider   this offer.</p>
<p>&quot;I'LL DO IT! I WILL BECOME DAWN'S   LOVER!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...You might not want to shout   that out into the heavens too much...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry...&quot; </p>
