<h1>Cherry Tree Dreams</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/yurifan.html">Yuri Fan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Jesse held her radio close to hear ear. &#147;I repeat, Team Rocket is 
hereby disbanded. No, it will not come back like last time. I repeat, 
Team Rocket is&#133;&#148;

James shook his head. &#147;No what are we going to do with our lives? All 
we are follow orders from the boss. If he isn&#146;t around&#133;&#148; 

&#147;James, you did this last time Team Rocket disbanded. They&#146;ll get back 
together. The important thing we have to do is get some powerful 
Pokemon in the meantime. Then, when the boss sees how powerful we have 
become in his absence, he might promote us.&#148; Jesse closed her eyes and 
dreamed about the rewards she knew were given to the upper members of 
Team Rocket. A life of pure luxury, not a care in the world&#133;

&#147;But where are we going to look? The boss always told us, and even he 
didn&#146;t know where the really good ones were half the time&#133;&#148; Suddenly, 
Jesse got a plan.

&#147;James, all of the people, what one group know where to find some 
REALLY strong Pokemon?&#148; James thought about it for a second. 

&#147;They wouldn&#146;t think twice about it. You know how gullible those three 
are&#133; We could get into their ranks so easily&#133;&#148; Jesse frowned.

&#147;Just don&#146;t sabotage anything until Team Rocket gets back together. 
They could show us Pokemon, training spots, connections&#133;.&#148; At the last 
word, James&#146;s eyes lit up.

&#147;Yes, we should hold back until team rocket comes back&#133;&#148;

Several days later&#133;

&#147;You want to what?&#148; Ash couldn&#146;t believe his ears. 

&#147;We&#146;ve really changed, and we want to apologize for all the trouble we 
caused. Besides, now that our group is gone, we have no reason to do 
evil. And what better place to not do evil&#133;&#148; Jesse paused.

&#147;Then in the group of Ash and Co!&#148; Jesse and James said it together.

&#147;To fight crime!&#148;

&#147;To protect the innocent!&#148;

&#147;Our works entered a new line&#148;

&#147;We aren&#146;t making a cent!

&#147;For Pokemon, for-&#147; Brock cut them off.

&#147;All right, all right, you can join us. Just no more singing!!!!&#148; 
Jesse and James smiled. Step 1: success.

&#147;So, what do you, um, do?&#148; Ash looked puzzled.

&#147;We walk around looking for Pokemon! And we talk to people for more 
information about them!&#148; 

&#147;That doesn&#146;t rhyme&#133;&#148; Jesse cut James off.

&#147;You mean you don&#146;t have a map? A secret hideout? A guide to what 
Pokemon are powerful?&#148; Misty shook her head.

&#147;Um, no.&#148; To everyone&#146;s surprise, Jesse and James both shrugged. 

&#147;Well, okay. We&#146;ll go get a room in this town to stay for the night. 
See you later!&#148; Contrary to popular belief, Jesse and James were not a 
couple. The only pretended to be one because they thought people would 
stop asking them, &#147;So when are you two gonna get together?&#148;

At the hotel room&#133;

&#147;Business is business, James. Never get involved with someone you work 
with.&#148; Jesse remembered well her conversation with him.

When was that? Four years ago? It all seemed a blur, her life of one 
professional failure after another. All by the hands of that brat and 
his friends.

&#147;Thinking about ringing his neck again?&#148; James read her like a book. 
She nodded.

&#147;Seeing them today was harder than I expected. I&#146;ll get over it. At 
least now, there is no chance of him screwing us up again. He is on 
our side now. The gullible fool...&#148;

 James nodded, and the two went to sleep.

The next day&#133;

&#147;Pikachu, I choose you!&#148; The small electric mouse came out of its 
ball, and a powerful lightning blast.

&#147;Nooooooooooooooooooo&#133;&#148; Jesse shrieked as her Arbok was KOed. 

&#147;I can&#146;t believe I am 18 years old and I am being shown up by a 14 
year old again!!!&#148; Jesse&#146;s brain couldn&#146;t take it anymore. This 
&#145;training session&#146; was like reliving the past all over again.

Misty walked up to the furious Rocket girl.

&#147;Let me help you, Jesse. You aren&#146;t teaching it the right moves. Use 
this.&#148; Jesse was both angry at Misty&#146;s insult and shocked at her 
generosity.

&#147;That&#146;s a TM, Misty. You are giving this to me?&#148; The 14 year old girl 
nodded.

&#147;Yes, well, it is Earthquake. Ground moves beat thunder types faster 
than poison.&#148; Jesse quickly wrote this down. 

&#147;Thank you&#133;&#148; The words almost stuck in her thought. She felt as if she 
just ate something awful.

&#147;This nice stuff is definitely going to take some getting used too&#133;&#148; 

Later that day&#133;

&#147;It&#146;s right over there! It&#146;s destroying the whole village! Help us!&#148; 
The villager ran in terror, as the huge electric dragon continued to 
destroy the town.

&#147;POKEMON NUMBER 599. PROBABLITY OF VICTORY OF ASH:12 MISTY:8 BROCK:13 
JAMES:4 JESSE: 3.&#148; The automated Pokedex spat out its statistics.

&#147;He&#146;s too powerful! We have to all use our Pokemon at once!&#148; Everyone 
summoned up their best monster, and sent it after the wild Pokemon.

Ash and James&#146;s were the first to fall. The dragon quickly 
electrocuted them. Misty&#146;s Staryu fell third, victim to another 
electric attack.

Brock&#146;s Onyx put up a good fight. It was immune to all lightning, so 
it had an advantage. Jesse had told her Pokemon to use a surprise 
attack.

&#147;Bite!&#148; The snake bit down, but it had no effect. Ash she watched 
Brock&#146;s Onyx finally get defeated, she could almost hear words in her 
head.

&#147;&#133;it is Earthquake. Ground moves beat thunder types&#133;&#148; She knew it was 
her only shot. 

&#147;Arbok, use the new technique!&#148; The ground started to shake and split. 
The huge dragon fell through a crack in the earth. 

&#147;Help me! Help me!&#148; Jesse could see that Misty was about to fall as 
well. She lunged towards the girl, eager to save her.

&#147;What are you doing! You hate her! Let her die!&#148; Jesse&#146;s mind was 
scolding her. 

&#147;She saved my life from the dragon. She gave me a powerful technique. 
I owe her something.&#148; Jesse saw the red haired trainer fall.

She quickly put her hands out, catching Misty&#146;s arm. With a mighty 
pull, she heaved Misty out of the ravine.

&#147;You saved my life!&#148; Misty said as the earthquake ended. Jesse just 
smiled.

&#147;Don&#146;t mention it.&#148; 

3 years later&#133;

Team Rocket still hadn&#146;t gotten back together, but Jesse hadn&#146;t really 
though about that for a long while. In fact, if they did get back 
together, she doubted if she would join at all.

James had also given up on the idea of being a Rocket again. Life was 
good. 

When they were the &#147;Good Guys&#148;, everybody liked them. In fact, the 
&#147;Famous Trio&#148; had been renamed &#147;Famous Quintet&#148; in honor of Jesse and 
James, who had by now saved the day for the group on countless 
occasions. 

But it was more than that. When they were on Team Rocket, Pokemon was 
their job. Now, Pokemon was fun. Exploring and helping people was 
their job.

The best part of the group was that everyone was friends. Jesse and 
James never gave a thought to romance. When you had close friends and 
a mission in life, who needs it? They had certainly managed when they 
were in Team Rocket. They all felt like they could be 7 years old 
again, just walking around and having fun. 

But one fateful day, that was all about to change&#133;

They were trying to find Bill, the Pokemaniac. Ash and Brock and Jesse 
searched for him in his house in Jhoto, and Misty and Jesse searched 
for him in his house in Kanto.

After defeating the skew of trainers on Nugget bridge, Misty guided 
Jesse through the forest of her hometown. As the seventeen year old 
trainer squeezed Jesse&#146;s hand, Jesse&#146;s felt herself blush.

&#147;Why are you blushing? She has held your hand before&#133;&#148; But as her mind 
drifted to the past, she felt her face get even redder.

&#147;Why are you thinking of her like that? Snap out of it!&#148; Jesse shook 
her head and continued to follow Misty.

&#147;We&#146;re almost there&#133;&#148; But when they reached the building, they 
stopped. Misty sat down near a cherry tree, and a small cherry blossom 
fell down, landing in her hair.

Jesse swallowed hard. &#147;Why are you doing this to yourself?&#148; Jesse 
looked at Misty. &#147;Well she is sweet, she&#146;s kind, she&#146;s beautiful&#133;&#148; 
Misty was wearing her red hair (which she had let grow long) down 
behind her back. She was wearing tiny shorts and a skimpy top, which 
was so revealing it looked like a large bra.

After seeing Jesse not sitting down, Misty sat up. &#147;Jesse, I need to 
talk to you. Actually I needed to talk to you about 3 years ago. I 
know it is the wrong thing to do, but I have to tell you.&#148; Jesse 
searched her memory. 3 years ago.

&#147;Jesse, I don&#146;t think we can be friends anymore. I am going to tell 
Ash I am leaving the group. It is not fair to ask you to leave.&#148; Jesse 
was shocked.

&#147;What did I do to offend you, Misty?&#148; Misty shook her head. Jesse 
could see that she was slightly trembling. 

&#147;It&#146;s not what you did, Jesse, it&#146;s what I did. I fell in love with 
you. Ever since you saved my life that day, all I could think about 
was you. You&#146;re so beautiful&#133;&#148; Misty started to cry.

&#147;I&#146;ll go now&#133;&#148; Jesse stopped her before she could turn around. She 
slowly took off her purple glove (the only thing she kept from Team 
Rocket) and wiped away Misty&#146;s tears.

&#147;Don&#146;t cry&#133;.don&#146;t cry&#133;&#148; Jesse looked at Misty. Misty, her friend, her 
companion, her teammate. She was beautiful, Jesse had to admit. But to 
love another girl? Jesse was not sure she was ready for that. 

Then she remembered how wonderful she felt when she saved her, and how 
beautiful that moment was when the cherry blossom hit her hair. She 
had such an innocent, incorruptible inner beauty. Like a storybook 
princess. 

The moment seemed to last forever for them. Then Misty slowly leaned 
forwards.

&#147;Ahh what the hell&#133;&#148; was the last thing Jesse thought before Misty 
kissed her.

Misty could feel the older woman&#146;s full lips with her tongue. She 
slowly pressed her body against Jesse&#146;s as she deepened the kiss.

&#147;Hey, you! Yes, you, the one kissing! Are you Misty, the gym leader?&#148; 
A young boy with a Jhoto accent rudely interrupted the moment. As 
Misty broke away, she felt rage build up inside her.

&#147;Do you know what they call people like you? Pests! That&#146;s what! 
Pests! Yes, I can battle you if that&#146;s what you want!&#148; Misty did not 
want to battle this boy, but she knew by her honor she had to.

As Misty and the boy left, Jesse stood by the cherry tree, stunned. 

&#147;What the hell just happened? Misty kissed you? And you liked it?&#148; 
Jesse remembered that sad, longing, worshipping look. 

&#147;Oh my God, I&#146;m falling in love with her.&#148; Even as Jesse said it out 
loud, she knew it wasn&#146;t true.

&#147;Not falling. You ARE in love with her. You&#146;ve probably been in love 
with her since before now, haven&#146;t you? And you didn&#146;t even notice, 
while she was suffering with her secret!&#148; Jesse&#146;s mind continued to 
yell at her. 

Jesse made her way back though the trees (without getting lost too 
badly) to Misty&#146;s gym. She walked in just in time to see the end of 
the duel.

&#147;Ampharos Thunderbolt!&#148; The Jhoto boy&#146;s Pokemon electrocuted Misty&#146;s 
Starmie. The water trainer sighed.

&#147;You win, Jhoto boy. Take my badge.&#148; As the boy left, smiling, Jesse 
walked up to Misty. 

&#147;Listen, Misty, I need to say something to you. I love you too. I 
never want to spend another moment away from you.&#148; As Misty began to 
cry again, Jesse pulled her into a second embrace. Misty could feel 
the Jesse&#146;s large breasts pressing on her own.

As much as Misty hated to do it, she broke the embrace. She ran to the 
door of the gym, and locked it. She didn&#146;t want another interruption.

Jesse giggled as she heard Misty lock the door. As the red haired 
trainer slowly walked towards her, she removed her top, revealing her 
B cup breasts. 

As Jesse saw the younger girl strip, she slowly removed her own top. 
Misty gasped at Jesse&#146;s breasts, which were much bigger than her own. 
In fact, they were the biggest she had ever seen. 

&#147;They&#146;re so big&#133;&#148; Misty was gasping with arousal. &#147;And so are your 
nipples&#133;&#148; Misty slowly leaned down and started to slowly suck on one 
of Jesse&#146;s large, pink, nipples.

Jesse moaned with pleasure. She was enjoying this very much, but she 
wanted to give Misty happiness first.

She stopped Misty, and they both removed the rest of their clothing.

&#147;You like big nipples?&#148; Misty nodded.

&#147;Uh-huh&#133;&#148; Jesse lowered her own face to Misty&#146;s breasts, and wrapped 
her mouth around the right nipple.

Jesse pulled her head back, until the nipple popped out of her mouth 
and moved back into position. After doing this once, she could already 
see the nipple becoming quite hard. She slowly did the same to same to 
the other one, and Misty moaned when it popped out of her mouth. 

&#147;Lie down.&#148; Misty obeyed the lusty girl&#146;s command. Jesse sat down next 
to her and started to use her thumb and forefinger to make tiny 
circles as she rubbed Misty&#146;s nipples.

As Misty gasped with delight, Jesse politely asked, &#147;How far do you 
want me to go, Misty?&#148; Between gasps, Misty managed to speak a little.

&#147;If you don&#146;t make love to me *gasp* I&#146;ll die, Jesse!&#148; Misty felt her 
body ache with desire. As Jesse&#146;s fingers continued to pleasure her, 
she started to tremble. 

Jesse leaned over Misty and moved her right hand down. As Misty pulled 
her close, Jesse gently brushed her hand against Misty&#146;s longing 
womanhood. 

Misty pulled Jesse closer, and felt her body go stiff. As she rode out 
her orgasm, Jesse was amazed.

&#147;She was that aroused? Wow, she really wanted it to be able to come 
after being rubbed once like that&#133;&#148; 

&#147;I&#146;m sorry, Jesse&#133;&#148; Jesse shook her head.

&#147;Nothing to be sorry about, my princess.&#148; Misty thought she hadn&#146;t 
heard her right.

&#147;What did you call me? &#145;My Princess?&#146;&#148; Jesse realized she hadn&#146;t meant 
for it to slip out.

&#147;I won&#146;t do it again, sorry&#133;&#148; 

&#147;Actually, Jesse, I like it&#133;&#148; Jesse smiled.

&#147;Call me Jessica.&#148; Misty giggled.

&#147;Okay&#133;Jessica.&#148; Jesse slowly got on top of Misty and put her weight 
down. 

&#147;Mmmmmmmmm&#133;&#148; Misty relished the feeling of Jesse&#146;s warm, large nipples 
pressed up against her own. 

Jesse deeply kissed Misty, and began to slowly grind her hips up and 
down. She could feel her body becoming warmer. After a few more 
minutes, Jesse slowly broke the kiss.

&#147;Lie down, Jessica.&#148; Jesse slowly obeyed, wondering if Misty had any 
tricks up her sleeve.

Misty slowly began to fondle Jesse&#146;s glorious breasts, enjoying the 
sound of Jesse&#146;s quiet moans. Then she slowly got on top of Jesse, and 
gently suckled her nipple. It was very slow, but Misty began to suck 
harder and harder. Jesse felt waves of electricity wash over her. 

Misty knew that Jesse was ready for more. She slowly slid her hand 
under her hips while she continued to suckle. As she let two fingers 
slowly slide into Jesse, the older girl screamed.

Misty slowly moved her fingers up and down. &#147;Harder! Harder!&#148; Jesse 
screamed for more. Misty obeyed and pushed her fingers in faster and 
harder.

&#147;Just like that, my princess, don&#146;t stop, don&#146;t stop, don&#146;t stop&#133;&#148; 
Misty could feel Jesse&#146;s pleasure button, and pinched it hard between 
her fingers.

&#147;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&#148; Jesse screamed and arched her head 
back as she exploded with her orgasm. As she rode out her afterglow, 
Misty just stared at her.

&#147;I love you so much. You&#146;re so wonderful.&#148; She kissed Jesse on the 
forehead.

&#147;I love you too, my princess.&#148; Misty slowly put her bra and underwear 
back on.

&#147;I wish my body was more like yours. Your wide, womanly hips. Your 
large breasts. Your big, pink nipples&#133;&#148; Jesse smiled.

&#147;You can. Do you think I was born with a body this good?&#148; Misty 
nodded.

&#147;Nope, it&#146;s all thanks to drinking one of these.&#148; Jesse held up a 
small bottle with the words &#147;Moomoo milk&#148; on it.

&#147;It is very high in hormones. It will change you forever.&#148; Misty 
grabbed at the bottle. 

&#147;Give me that.&#148; She quickly swallowed it down, drinking the whole 
bottle. Jesse gasped.

&#147;No! Not the whole thing! I only drank one third of the bottle!&#148; Misty 
looked down at her transforming body.

She slowly saw her breasts growing and growing, until they burst out 
of her bra and continued to grow after that. She could feel her tiny 
shoulders slowly start to broaden a little to accompany the heavier 
load. Her hips began to widen as well, eventually bursting out of her 
underwear and growing past the size of Jesse&#146;s already very womanly 
hips.

She looked at her breasts again. They were still growing. Soon her 
boobs became even larger than Jesse&#146;s, and then they grew after that. 
Then she saw the best part. As her breasts slowly stopped growing and 
her hips slowly stopped getting wider, she saw them.

She now had incredibly large, pink nipples. 

&#147;Oh my god yes!!!! Oh that was so wonderful! It was so great to watch 
and it felt so good!&#148; Jesse was in a stupor, staring at Misty&#146;s 
insanely attractive body, practically drooling. 

&#147;Misty, you have no idea how turned on I am right now.&#148; She stared at 
the formerly small, petite girl with amazement.

She slowly leaned forward and began to lick at Misty&#146;s incredibly 
large and sexy breasts. Misty slowly laid down moaned with please as 
Jesse continued to feast. 

Jesse wrapped her small mouth around one of Misty&#146;s large nipples. &#147;I 
thought mine were big&#133;&#148; Jesse started to suckle. The taste of the pink 
flesh was wonderful.

And Misty could feel the pleasure of the suckling tenfold. She loudly 
moaned in rhythm to the sucking.

Soon Misty got on top of Jesse, and started to deeply kiss her. Jesse 
found it ironic that just a few hours ago, they had been in the exact 
same position, but she had been on top.
Jesse decided she liked it better from where she was now.

As Misty started to grind her very womanly hips on Jesse&#146;s, she could 
feel herself getting warmer. As the two pairs of large breasts pushed 
together, they could feel their nipples growing hard on each other.

Misty could feel an orgasm building up inside her as well. She loved 
the feeling of her new body. It was so sexy and wonderful, and it was 
great when she pinned Jesse down.

Misty and Jesse deepened the kiss as both of their orgasms came near. 
They broke the kiss and yelled in passion as they simultaneously 
climaxed. After they both got their breath back, Jesse whispered, &#147;I 
love you, Misty. And I meant it. I never want to be without you, for 
the rest of my life&#148; 

&#147;I love you too, and I never want to be without you, either. And thank 
you for letting me have this.&#148; At the word &#145;this&#146; Misty gently pushed 
her feminine body down on Jesse&#146;s, resulting in the pink haired girl 
to gasp with delight. Misty slowly started to get up.

&#147;Don&#146;t get up, my princess; I want you to sleep on me&#133;&#148; Misty smiled.

&#147;I was hoping you would say that, Jessica.&#148; Misty got back on top of 
Jesse, and the two lovers went to sleep. 

------------------------------------------------------------

That is the end to Cherry Tree Dreams. Please email me and tell me 
what you thought about it.

I may write a sequel, but only if a lot of people want me to, because 
the story seems a bit finished as it is. Hope to hear from you soon!

SPECIAL NOTE TO ANYONE WHO PLAYED THOUGH POKEMON GOLD/SILVER:
Spoiler Alert for those who have not!
The scene with Misty getting caught kissing another girl really 
happened! When you go to Kanto, and first see Misty, she is facing 
another girl, and a heart floats between them! I am not kidding! Play 
it again if you don&#146;t believe me! She also says the whole speech about 
pests and stuff!
