The curiously acrid scent of the coming rain somehow finally managed to 
overcome the pleasant scents that the often-sprawling flower gardens of 
Celadon City produced, causing Miranda to cast her gaze upward at the 
bleakly gray haze that covered the September sky. For the first time, 
the courier noticed the way that the once thin, wispy clouds had become 
thick and ominous, the gentle gray/white tone had been replaced by a 
dark and sinister wall that blocked out nearly all light and promised of 
a vicious storm to come. In desperation, the courier searched the sky 
for one of the scarce patches of pale blue hope, but found not a one 
among the ominous cloud cover. 

&quot;Dreck,&quot; she cursed. Miranda hating riding in the rain... 

***

Alone in her comfortable, modestly decorated inner-sanctum, Erika sat 
before the window that overlooked the exterior gardens of her estate. As 
gray curtains of early spring rain fell relentlessly from the sky above, 
the Gym Leader stared out past her reflection in the largest of the 
three windows inset in the outer wall, contemplating the new year ahead. 

Outside, the rain fell so heavily that she could barely make out the 
road that lead to the front gates of her estate, and as she contemplated 
the warm bath that she&#39;d soon be soaking in, the woman caught sight of 
movement. With a raised eyebrow, the Gym Leader set her teacup down and 
leaned a little closer to the window, searching for whatever it was that 
had broken her quiet reverie. 

A moment of fruitless searching later, though, a soft knocking caught 
Erika&#39;s attention. &quot;Yes?&quot; she inquired simply, knowing immediately that 
it was only her apprentice Samantha, and knowing that the woman was 
merely being polite, even after so many years together.

&quot;M&#39;Lady,&quot; said Samantha, pushing open the door, her voice a sounding 
strangely flustered, &quot;It seems that we have a visitor.&quot;

Erika nodded, finishing her tea and setting the handless cup down on a 
small end table before turning her patient gaze towards Samantha, who 
jumped suddenly as thunder crashed loudly outside. &quot;Is my bath ready?&quot; 
the Gym Leader inquired calmly, unphased by the sudden explosion of 
light and sound, and still mildly amused by the woman&#39;s small phobia. 

Samantha opened her mouth to speak, but quickly caught herself, her 
understanding of Erika&#39;s often-curious ways still catching her off guard 
now and then. &quot;I- That is, yes, M&#39;Lady,&quot; she said with a nod.

Erika smiled a little as she swung her legs and set her feet upon the 
plushly carpeted floor. &quot;Good, then show our guest in and have one of 
the girls make some more tea and prepare something nice for lunch,&quot; the 
gym leader instructed, gliding almost noiselessly across the room, the 
look in her deep green eyes causing Samantha to blush deeply, &quot;I&#39;m sure 
he&#39;ll be cold and hungry. A warm bath and a hot meal is the least I can 
offer someone on such a dreary day.&quot;

&quot;A- Actually,&quot; stammered Samantha, glancing down at her own hand 
clutching the doorknob all too tightly as Erika drew closer and stood 
upon her toes to be eye level with her apprentice, &quot;It&#39;s not a him, it&#39;s 
a her.&quot;

&quot;No matter,&quot; whispered Erika wistfully, a small smile crossing her lips 
as she brought them close to Samantha&#39;s, &quot;A guest is a guest. Did she 
say what she wanted?&quot;

Samantha cleared her throat, her pulse quickening as Erika hovered near 
her, the woman&#39;s arms held behind her back as the mischievous glint in 
the Gym Leader&#39;s eyes to teased her playfully. &quot;She said she was one of 
the Lilcamp couriers. She has a package-&quot;

&quot;THE package?!&quot; exclaimed Erika in a rare moment of unbridled excitement 
before leaping back and clapping her hands together tightly, startling 
Samantha.

Her apprentice nodded, amused, her tone taking on a dramatic air. &quot;Yes, 
M&#39;Lady. &#39;IT&#39; has arrived.&quot;

Erika laughed, throwing her head back as she spun her way back across 
the room to where three half-red and half-white orbs sat on a special 
place upon her dressing table. &quot;Then let us waist no more time, my 
dear,&quot; she said, lovingly taking up the first of the trio before gliding 
back towards Samantha.

&quot;As you wish, M&#39;Lady,&quot; Samantha replied, a feeling of disappointment 
cutting through her amused admiration as Erika slipped past her.

&quot;Oh, more one thing,&quot; said Erika, pausing mid-stride before stepping 
carefully backwards, retracing her steps until she stood beside 
Samantha.

&quot;Yes, M&#39;Lady?&quot; the woman inquired, looking down cast even as Erika 
slipped her fingers through her own.

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t keep our guest waiting,&quot; the Gym Leader teased, giving 
Samantha&#39;s hand a gentle squeeze, causing Samantha to meet her gaze, 
&quot;She&#39;s probably dying of pneumonia as we speak.&quot;

Samantha caught the amused tone and smiled, but her assurance that it 
would be taken care of was suddenly cut short by Erika&#39;s lips suddenly 
pressed against her own. Samantha&#39;s fingers let go of the door handle in 
response, but the sensation of Erika&#39;s soft lips pressing against her 
own as the woman&#39;s arms wrapped lovingly around Samantha, quickly 
banishing her brewing disappointment.

&quot;Fear not, dearest,&quot; whispered Erika, pushing herself up on her toes to 
give Samantha&#39;s ear a playful nibble, &quot;I&#39;ll always make time for you. I 
promise.&quot;

Samantha nodded, reassurance flooding her she returned her mentor&#39;s fond 
embrace and gave the woman&#39;s neck a gentle kiss. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she 
replied, her normally good humor returning, &quot;I really should know better 
than to be so selfish-&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; said Erika sternly, pushing Samantha back a bit and meeting her 
lover&#39;s eyes with an unyielding, yet loving expression, &quot;You&#39;re not 
selfish. Infact, you&#39;re all that I could ask for in an apprentice. Kind, 
compassionate, a quick study, and you put up with me.&quot;

Samantha snickered, bowing her head to hide the sly smile as her 
mentor&#39;s fingers gently brushed her fiery red bangs back. &quot;There are 
those who say that you&#39;re quite barmy, M&#39;Lady,&quot; she confessed, feeling 
both angry at those who dared speak ill of the woman, and guilty for 
repeating the words, &quot;And I can&#39;t imagine trying to explain our 
relationship to anyone outside the Gym, but in my own way, I love you. 
That&#39;s why it hurts some times. When you spend time with the others, or 
cancel our plans when duty calls. It&#39;s selfish of me, I know, but I just 
&#39;need&#39; to spend all the time I can with you... I, I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;ve 
overstepped my bounds, I-&quot;

Erika chuckled quietly, smiling serenely as she placed a finger to 
Samantha&#39;s lips to silence her. &quot;A selfish woman that does not make,&quot; 
said the Gym Leader cryptically, silencing Samantha&#39;s further protests 
with a slow shake of her head, &quot;You are the most important person in my 
life, dearest. The more time that you spend with me, the more that you 
learn. And I&#39;ll need someone wise and strong to take over if something 
should ever happen to me-&quot;

&quot;M&#39;Lady, don&#39;t even joke about that-!&quot; exclaimed Samantha, her 
expression stricken even as Erika&#39;s soft hand caressed her face 
tenderly.

&quot;IF, I said,&quot; her mentor chuckled, glancing down the wooden staircase 
for a moment before turning her attention back to Samantha, &quot;Now then. 
Two things, my dearest apprentice. Number one, don&#39;t keep our guest 
waiting, and number two-&quot; and Samantha blushed as Erika waved a warning 
finger, amusement sparkling in her eyes, &quot;You know you can just call me 
&#39;Erika&#39;. &#39;M&#39;Lady&#39; is so... Formal! Especially when we&#39;re alone 
together...&quot;

Erika gave Samantha a final kiss before gliding down the hall. &quot;Be a 
dear and tell the courier that I&#39;ll be down in a minute, would you?&quot; she 
requested, no longer speaking as Samantha&#39;s lover but as her Gym Leader.

&quot;Yes, M&#39;Lady,&quot; the woman replied with more than a hint of amusement, 
giving Erika a quick bow before disappearing down the wide staircase...

***

Miranda surveyed her surroundings as she sipped from the very welcome 
mug of hot tea, a heavy blanket over her still shivering shoulders as 
she sat near a pleasant fire in the gym&#39;s expansive sitting room. The 
large, comfortable room was filled with over stuffed chairs and couches, 
perfect for lounging around on rainy days whilst reading a book, as a 
few of Erika&#39;s junior apprentices did. Two others, sat at the dark oaken 
tables, one girl smirking smugly as the other sat staring in abject 
horror at the board between them as the tide of the chess game they were 
currently embroiled in suddenly turned.

&quot;Excuse me, miss,&quot; came Samantha&#39;s polite, accented tone, &quot;But I&#39;ve 
arranged for some dry clothes for you, and Lady Erika wishes to speak 
with you about the delivery.&quot;

&quot;Th-thank you,&quot; replied Miranda, caught a little off guard and feeling a 
touch embarrassed about the way her teeth were chattering.

Samantha shrugged, smiling reassuringly as she set down the bundle of 
cloths she carried. &quot;It&#39;s nothing,&quot; she replied, picking up a simple yet 
elegant kimono comprised of golden silk, decorated with shifting, 
spiraling orange patterns, examining it carefully for a moment. &quot;Hm. No, 
not your colour,&quot; the woman muttered, tossing the garment onto an 
unoccupied chair and reaching for a second. This one was made from a 
soft, dark purple material, bordered with subtle black patterns. 

&quot;Um, I generally prefer more practical clothing,&quot; commented Miranda, 
causing Samantha to give the courier&#39;s now wetly clinging, but usually 
loose fitting t-shirt and tattered jeans with ripped knees a disquieted 
look.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure this will do until we can arrange for something more 
your style, miss,&quot; commented Samantha, meeting Miranda&#39;s gaze with 
sudden amusement, &quot;Now then, if you&#39;d just follow me?&quot; 

The courier nodded, slowly struggling to her feet before following 
Samantha from the common room.

Once they&#39;d passed beyond a pair of heavily looking, dark wooden doors 
that slid into the walls at the slightest touch, Miranda found herself 
back in the strangely arcing corridor that lead both back to the front 
entrance as well as deeper into the Celadon Gym. The courier had been 
thankful to be rid of her soaking wet jacket and water logged shoes, but 
she couldn&#39;t help but still feel guilty as water dripped off her still 
damp clothes, leaving a discernable trail wherever the girl went. 

Samantha seemed unconcerned, however, leading Miranda past a large 
window that provided a ground level view of what at first appeared to be 
a semi-tropical forest, but was actually a grove of very healthy trees 
on the edge of the immense garden the gym used as it&#39;s battle ground. 

&quot;Interesting set up you have here,&quot; the courier commented as the 
automated sprinkler system sprayed water against the glass.

Samantha nodded thoughtfully, a strange smile crossing her lips. &quot;This 
place was designed by Gym Leader Erika&#39;s grandMother quite some time 
ago,&quot; she explained, opening a door and ushering Miranda into a brightly 
lit restroom with carpeted floors and sufficient places for both wet 
towels and clothes to be hung to dry, &quot;But M&#39;Lady Erika has made some 
improvements over the years.&quot;

Miranda nodded, shuffling her bare feet across the thickly carpeted 
floor to dry them before turning to Erika&#39;s apprentice with a concerned 
look. &quot;Um, I was wondering...&quot; she said, trying to think of the right 
words as Samantha looked back at her expectantly.

&quot;Oh, now don&#39;t be shy, dear, speak your mind.&quot;

Miranda blushed, trying not to laugh nervously as Samantha gave her what 
was supposed to be a reassuring smile. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just that I-I&#39;m kinda 
shy, and-&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; replied Samantha, waving her hand dismissively, setting 
down the kimono before turning to leave, &quot;However, if you need any help, 
don&#39;t be afraid to ask. I&#39;ll just outside the door if you need me for 
anything.&quot;

The courier nodded thankfully, missing the innuendo in the woman&#39;s tone 
and waiting for Samantha to leave before straining to unbutton her denim 
jeans and carefully pulling her shirt up over her head. 

&quot;What a day,&quot; Miranda muttered to her reflection in the mirror, nearly 
laughing at the sight of her long dark hair, made frizzy by a failed 
attempt to towel dry it, &quot;If it weren&#39;t for that stupid flat tire I&#39;d be 
sitting quietly drinking tea, wearing my OWN clothes...&quot; 

Miranda sighed heavily, glancing down at the dark coloured kimono that 
now lay folded on the counter beside her, vaguely wondering if there was 
some polite way of rejecting the offer, &quot;Instead I&#39;m soaking wet and all 
I&#39;ve got to change into is a dress. Oh well, so much for first 
impressions...&quot;
