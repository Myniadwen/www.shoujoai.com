<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/stmanga-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>&quot;We have a new person in the class today,&quot; Kakashi announced to his PE 
class as they all lined up. &quot;He&#39;s best friends with the student, that 
you may know. He&#39;s a close friend of Ash Ketchum, and I don&#39;t want you 
to treat him any different to the rest of us! Everyone say hello to 
him!&quot;

The class looked down and waved at the yellow mouse below them and they 
said hi in quite a strange reaction. &quot;Yes, it&#39;s his Pikachu!&quot;

Sapphire Corandum sat patiently in the principle&#39;s office. She was also 
a student of this school a year ago, now she&#39;s left school. She 
continued being an expert in magic and witchcraft, the reason she was 
wanted to become a teacher was because she adored her sister, Shyst. She 
deserved a lot more love then she was getting, Sapphire&#39;s sister was 
painfully shy and so sensitive. The long pink haired lady was fully 
aware of the crazy people that were part of the school. She wanted to 
protect her sister and she was relieved that her tutor, Paz granted her 
the permission to protect her sister.

When Sapphire inspected her old school, she realized that nothing had 
changed at all, the staff were all the same and the hall way was the 
same as ever, the occasional litter and doodles on the walls. She 
wondered how on earth Vicky Pollard was not expelled? She saw Vicky 
smoking outside the school gates at break time. Naruto Uzumaki, she 
utterly despised the loud lad with a pure passion, as well as the other 
ninja wannabes, she could finally punish the whole lot of them at her 
own pleasure.

&#39;Shyst, your sister&#39;s here to protect you!&#39;

Sapphire&#39;s childhood was far from perfect. Her parents, especially her 
father was consumed with greed. She thought that she suffered bad, but 
after changing her father into a beast and her mother into a rabbit 
girl, it seemed like Shyst was the one who was suffering now. Sapphire&#39;s 
suffering had ended when she cursed her parents but the pain still 
continued for Shyst. Her sister was timid, dependent, weak and childish, 
she was the complete opposite of Sapphire who was brave, independent and 
strong.

Shizune entered the office. Sapphire remembered Shizune very well, she 
never left Tsunade&#39;s side, she was almost like Tsunade&#39;s assistant. The 
short dark haired woman smiled at Sapphire as she walked over and sat in 
the principle&#39;s chair.

&quot;All grown up I see, Shizune.&quot; Sapphire told her as she flicked her pink 
hair back.
&quot;Erm yeah,&quot; Shizune giggled. &quot;Tsunade has to deal with some students, so 
she asked me to keep you company till she&#39;s done!&quot;

&quot;I see the students are still crazy as ever,&quot; The witch confirmed as 
smiled at Shizune. &quot;Nothing has changed at all since I graduated.&quot;

&quot;Yep, we&#39;re still the same.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m surprised Naruto is still here,&quot; Sapphire admitted. &quot;Is he one of 
the students that Tsunade&#39;s grilling?&quot;

&quot;Actually no,&quot; Shizune replied. &quot;It&#39;s Boob bearing Rebecca and Luke.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m surprised she&#39;s not pregnant yet!&quot; Sapphire muttered whilst she 
placed her elbow on the shiny wooden desk.

&quot;They&#39;re just lucky,&quot; Shizune replied. &quot;Anyway, what brings you into 
becoming a teacher?&quot; Shizune spun around the chair as she asked.

&quot;Just looking out for my sister,&quot; Sapphire stated as she folded her 
arms. &quot;I&#39;m leaving when she graduates.&quot;

There was then sudden silence, Shizune smiled and said, &quot;So how&#39;s the 
magic coming along?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s coming along brilliantly.&quot; Replied Sapphire as she firmly held 
onto her golden stick with a sapphire gem at the end. &quot;I&#39;m much better 
with magic, then I used to be.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s good to hear.&quot;

Tsunade entered her office in an exhausted state as Shizune stood up and 
allowed the poor principle to sit back in her seat. Tsunade sighed as 
she twirled round the chair and faced Sapphire. &quot;Welcome back Sapphire,&quot; 
Croaked the blonde principle. &quot;You&#39;ll be in your class after the bell 
rings, OK. Firstly I have remind you of some rules, since I am aware 
that you&#39;re here to look out for your sister, and also your abilities. 
Number one, don&#39;t use your magic to punish the students. Number two, 
only use violence in extreme cases. Number three, no swearing, and 
finally, always be on time for staff meetings.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve cut half the fun out there principle,&quot; Sapphire chuckled as she 
stood up. &quot;But OK, I&#39;ll listen to them.&quot;

&quot;Good. Now here is your school planner,&quot; Tsunade announced as she handed 
the witch a green book. &quot;It has the school rules, your time table for 
lessons registers, and a diary for you to write deadlines and important 
dates.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Tsunade,&quot; Sapphire told her. &quot;It will be useful indeed. Oh and 
another thing, if ANYONE bullies Shyst, in anyway whatsoever, including 
people who are making her feel uncomfortable, let me deal with them!&quot;

&quot;You have a deal,&quot; Tsunade said as she shook hands with the new teacher 
Miss Sapphire Corandum . &quot;The students are going to be shocked when they 
see you, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll give them a good kick in the butt when 
necessary.&quot;

&quot;Kids these days,&quot; Sapphire moaned. &quot;They all need their butts kicked, 
especially Naruto. I&#39;m surprised you haven&#39;t expelled him yet.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s getting better, although he still calls me Granny-Tsunade.&quot;

&quot;Some people never change.&quot;

The bell&#39;s sound had alarmed everyone. Sapphire faced the door in 
determination. &quot;Good luck Sapphire, for your first lesson teaching.&quot; 
Tsunade whispered whilst she patted her back. Sapphire then marched out 
the office with a determined smirk on her face, as she closed the door 
behind her gently. What a huge surprise she would give the class if they 
remembered her.

&quot;Rnebecca and Luke so loved each other!&quot; Ritchie exclaimed as he 
explained what happened in health and social care, with Ash, May, Tyson 
and Naruto. &quot;She called Umbridge an old slag.&quot;

&quot;Good for her,&quot; Ash said as he roared with laughter. &quot;I&#39;d love to be in 
your lesson Ritchie, they sound so cool.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t do anything in the lesson,&quot; Ritchie admitted. &quot;I was too busy 
flirting with Gary and Tracey. Vash didn&#39;t do anything.&quot;

&quot;Rebecca is so fat ain&#39;t she? And Luke is fucking snob anyway,&quot; Naruto 
replied as he crossed his arms. &quot;They&#39;re just attention seeking idiots 
and I hate them. They were ones who had sex in the restroom&quot;

&quot;Why hello there Mr hypocrite,&quot; Sakura shouted as she turned to glare at 
Naruto. &quot;Weren&#39;t you the one who urinated on the wall and wrote &#39;Granny 
Tsunade is fat&#39; on the wall. You did date Rebecca if you remember?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t remind me!&quot; Naruto moaned as he leaned backwards on his chair.

&quot;Oh and by the way Ritchie, Ash and Gary,&quot; Sakura smiled as she waved 
her arms, &quot;Your auditions yesterday were brilliant. Tell Drew I loved 
his outfit and tell Harley and Tracey, I thought they was cool as well.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Ritchie and Ash replied.

&quot;What auditions?&quot; Naruto asked furiously. &quot;Don&#39;t tell me it was when 
they were singing that song from Right Said Fred.&quot;

&quot;Yep it was,&quot; Sakura snapped at Naruto. &quot;They were brilliant. Very sexy 
and very talented.&quot; The jealousy from Naruto seemed to be at a raging 
rate.

&quot;Cheer up Naruto,&quot; Luna said as she smiled at the moaning loud blonde. 
&quot;It&#39;s Christmas soon.&quot;

&quot;Another four months time!&quot; Max Tate, a cute blonde guy, who was Tyson&#39;s 
friend announced to Luna before he saw Gary lean on his desk and wink at 
him. &quot;What are you doing Gary?&quot; He asked as he felt Gary move him from 
his seat and dance with him.

&quot;What are you doing to my friend, Maxie?&quot; Tyson asked Gary as the 
bluenette watched Gary ram his tongue down Max&#39;s throat. Their eyes were 
firmly shut and they held onto each other rather tightly. Tyson&#39;s face 
turned into a face of horror and by looking at his other friend, Ray, 
who was also in quite a shock; Gary&#39;s actions were very unexpected. 
&quot;WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU DOING?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong Gay-boy?&quot; Gary smirked as he winked at Tyson. &quot;Jealous 
that it wasn&#39;t you who I kissed?&quot;

&quot;NO WAY!&quot; Tyson snapped. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you just kissed Max like 
that!&quot;

&quot;Just for a bit of fun,&quot; Gary winked as he pushed Max away from his seat 
and sat down again.

&quot;THAT WAS HOT!&quot; Sakura yelled out as she praised the kissing between 
Gary and Max. Sakura faced Ino, who was looking quite sad than her usual 
self. Ino came with Sakura to the doctors to test if she was pregnant. 
Although Ino was hoping that the results would be negative, the doctor 
confirmed that she was pregnant. Ino felt that a huge ton of bricks had 
fallen on her. First her friend admits she has a crush on her and now 
that she was pregnant, with either Sasuke or Itachi&#39;s kid. &quot;What&#39;s wrong 
Ino?&quot;Sakura asked in concern.

&quot;Nothing,&quot; Ino sighed as she rested her head on Sakura&#39;s shoulder. &quot;It 
was just, I was hoping you wouldn&#39;t be pregnant. I do love babies a lot 
just, I feel bad I wasn&#39;t there for you that&#39;s all!&quot;
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it!&quot; Sakura said as she smiled. &quot;We should get 
through this, somehow. The pregnancy is going to be a secret OK.&quot;

&quot;I think that&#39;s the best thing to do, for now.&quot;

The classroom door opened widely and the tall woman, Sapphire arrived as 
she stepped to the teacher&#39;s desk. This was the first few seconds of her 
life being a teacher, and the rest of it was going to be interesting. 
The wand was still placed firmly in her hand as her face looked strict 
and direct. The class were in shock as they remembered Sapphire from 
when she graduated from last year, and they knew she was Shyst&#39;s sister. 
#

&quot;Sapphire!&quot;

&quot;Sapphire!&quot;

&quot;Sapphire!&quot;

The class shouted out her name in extreme shock as they whispered 
amongst themselves. Sapphire smirked as she looked at her new class. 
&quot;Exactly the reaction, I was expecting!&quot; She confessed. &quot;As you know, I 
am Sapphire, from now on you will call me Miss Corandum!&quot; Sapphire 
marched around the black board with head hands behind her back. &quot;I will 
be your new teachers from now on.&quot;

&quot;Can this day, get any worse?&quot; Naruto shouted out as he leaned backwards 
on his chair. &quot;A witch for a teacher!&quot;

&quot;Things will get a lot worse, if you carry on disturbing the class! &quot; 
Sapphire warned Naruto as she pointed her wand at him in a rather 
aggressive way. &quot;I make the rules here, there&#39;ll be no nonsense, you 
will do nothing but work!&quot;</pre>
