<h1>Rainbow Reminiscence (part 8 of 18)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nikolai.html">Nikolai Mirovich</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/rainbow-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Miranda glanced up habitually as they entered the garden once more. High 
above the large glass dome showed the clear pale blue of a sky, free of 
the dark storm clouds of the day before. &quot;Do you hold all of your 
classes in here?&quot; she inquired, trailing just behind Erika, occasionally 
stumbling over the folds of the kimono she wore as her hostess&#39;s quick 
yet unhurried pace made Erika seem to hover along the winding flat stone 
path.

&quot;Not always,&quot; the Gym Leader explained, turning her head towards an 
expansive bed of orange pedaled flowers with nearly black centers, 
inhaling deeply as she spoke, &quot;but my apprentice finds that the serene 
beauty of the arboretum is more conductive to inspiration.&quot;

&quot;To be honest, I find tragedy to be the best inspiration,&quot; the courier 
replied, catching the scent of the flower&#39;s pollen in the air and 
smiling as it seemed to clear her mind.

&quot;You&#39;ve found love to be an inspiration as well, though, haven&#39;t you?&quot; 

Miranda glanced down at the large, black leather book in her arms and 
nodded slowly. &quot;I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;d feel right about reading anything 
about &#39;him&#39;,&quot; she muttered, shaking her head slowly, still not used to 
the feeling of her hair unbound and tangle free, &quot;Well, anything 
romantic anyway.&quot;

Erika nodded sagely as the sound of Samantha&#39;s voice carried across the 
grassy field to them from the large, light blue painted gazebo the 
poetry class was being taught in. &quot;Then feel free to read us something 
that expresses your feelings about your breakup,&quot; the woman suggested in 
her usual all knowing tone, &quot;venting can be fairly therapeutic after 
all. And anger can be as beautiful as laughter.&quot;

&quot;My dad always said my mom was more beautiful when she was angry,&quot; 
Miranda chuckled, &quot;he said that if it wasn&#39;t for that they might not 
have gotten together.&quot;

The sounds of different voices reached their ears as they near the 
class, the light that reflected off the coppery red of Samantha&#39;s hair 
making her stand out amongst the students. &quot;I take it she didn&#39;t like 
him at first?&quot; inquired Erika rhetorically.

&quot;My Mother&#39;s not the most trusting sort,&quot; the courier explained, 
standing a little taller and trying to catch Samantha&#39;s words, &quot;and 
ironically enough my Mother was kinda suspicious of the couriers who 
were always in and out of the restaurant she worked in. It&#39;s a good 
thing my Father has that whole harmless thing going on.&quot;

&quot;Has?&quot; inquired Erika, stopping and glancing over her shoulder at 
Miranda who had gritted her teeth, hugging the scarred cover of her 
poetry book to herself protectively.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; the girl muttered, giving her head a shake, &quot;sometimes I forget 
he&#39;s gone.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve gone through quite a bit in a short space of time, haven&#39;t you?&quot; 
said Erika, turning to Miranda and moving to hold the courier, &quot;more 
than anyone deserves to go through in one life time.&quot;

&quot;My mom&#39;s remarried and my favourite uncle ran out on my Aunt Laurna 
didn&#39;t help much either,&quot; the girl added, relaxing as Erika held her, 
leaning into the warm comfort of the embrace, &quot;I dunno, maybe it&#39;s just 
another Lavender Town thing. People say we&#39;re all crazy for living there 
with all those ghosts, maybe their right. Maybe so many reminders of 
death in one place just attracts bad luck.&quot; 

Erika shook her head slowly. &quot;No,&quot; she told Miranda, meeting and holding 
the courier&#39;s gaze for a moment, searching the stormy gray depths of her 
eyes, &quot;even this place, with all its beauty and splendor is not without 
its misfortune. People make their own destinies, Miranda. Our fortunes 
are altered as much by the actions of people as they are by random 
chance. In of itself, a place is just a place. It&#39;s what we make of a 
place that alters what it is and what happens there.&quot;

The courier nodded slowly, backing out of Erika&#39;s arms and opening the 
heavy covers of her hardbound book. &quot;It&#39;s still hard to call it home, 
though,&quot; she replied after a moment, the dry pages of the book rustling 
as Miranda flipped backwards from the first completely blank page, &quot;I 
don&#39;t even like to look at some of these sometimes, but I suppose I 
can&#39;t keep running away all the time.&quot;

Erika smiled patiently nodding thoughtfully before glancing back at the 
gazebo. &quot;It&#39;s really quite remarkable how many people eventually come 
here after running away from themselves for so long,&quot; the woman mused as 
Miranda cast the small assembled group a curious glance and caught 
Samantha&#39;s eye from across the field.

&quot;Like your apprentice?&quot; the courier inquired, only to have the woman 
glide on towards their destination.

&quot;Whenever you&#39;re ready, deary,&quot; said Erika sagely, leaving Miranda to 
ponder a moment.

&#39;I guess she really does respect privacy,&#39; Miranda thought to herself, 
slamming the heavy book closed and pushing down the anxiety at having 
left her backpack on the bench. &quot;I suppose I can trust them not to touch 
it,&quot; she muttered, glancing uncertainly over her shoulder before 
striding awkwardly after Erika...
