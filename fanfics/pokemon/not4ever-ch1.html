<h1>It's Not Forever</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/danachan.html">dana-chan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Notes: I watched the second movie the day that I was first 
inspired to write this. This, which is...? What is it, you ask? 
It&#39;s... I suppose you can call it an experiment. I wanted to try 
something new, and I can&#39;t help it, but they&#39;re *cute* together... Can 
you guess who I&#39;m about to slash together? *grins*

Oh, btw--a bit of angst, a ton of fluff, and sap that you&#39;re sure to 
get stuck in waist deep. Sure to give a warm and fuzzy feeling or two. 
:)

Feedback: Feedback would be appreciated.

As of March &#39;06: Shamouti is now known by it&#39;s proper name, Aashia 
Island. Thank you, Julianne. v ^_^

------------------------------------------------------------

We&#39;re going to be leaving Aashia Island in a half-hour; we came here 
by accident, and Satoshi saved the world...

Some things just sneak up on you like that, I suppose.

With a sigh, I walk out onto the patio. The sky is clear, and the 
clouds that linger in the sky are fluffy and white. The destruction of 
the day that passed before has vanished from site; it&#39;s like the 
world&#39;s existence never hung in the balance, and that it wasn&#39;t 
*Satoshi* who saved us all.

With a sigh, I drop to the edge, sitting and dangling my legs over the 
side. I didn&#39;t want to be here in the first place, but now there&#39;s 
something that&#39;s holding me back.

And there&#39;s no way I&#39;d ever tell her; I don&#39;t think she&#39;d think me 
serious... I don&#39;t think she&#39;d believe me. I don&#39;t think she&#39;d think 
that I could possibly be telling the truth...

&quot;There you are, Satoshi and Kenji are looking for you.&quot;

I look up at the sound of her voice. She&#39;s standing at the patio 
opening, dressed casually. She slips off her sunglasses to smile at 
me; she wouldn&#39;t even smile at me in the beginning, and when she does, 
it&#39;s so very beautiful... &quot;That was some ride, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; she asks as 
she walks to my side. She drops to a sitting position without question 
at all--she doesn&#39;t even know if I want company or not.

But I don&#39;t mind.

Not much, at least.

&quot;It was something,&quot; I say, looking out over the island, away from her 
pale skin, and the bright auburn of her hair. &quot;I almost thought we 
weren&#39;t going to make it.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you mean something else by that?&quot; she grins. &quot;Don&#39;t you mean 
you thought *Satoshi* wouldn&#39;t be able to make it?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; I reply, &quot;he was holding the world&#39;s fate in his hands... I 
suppose it could be said that way.&quot;

We&#39;re silent after that, and I turn to her. Her profile greets me, her 
eyes focused on something else, something far in the distance. &quot;He 
must,&quot; she begins, her voice melodic, &quot;have seen just what was in the 
balance.&quot;

I nod, and turn away. &quot;He&#39;s like that. You think Satoshi&#39;s going to 
fail, and then he pulls through...&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; she asks.

I nod. &quot;Really. He amazes me over and over...&quot;

&quot;Do you really not want him as a boyfriend?&quot; she asks, and I feel a 
pang of *something*--something painful and unexplainable--near my 
heart.

&quot;Not at all. I love him; as a brother, even if he&#39;s *not* my 
brother... I think we&#39;ve been through too much for me to love him any 
other way.&quot; I finish with a slight shrug.

&quot;Really?&quot; she asks.

I nod. &quot;Really... There&#39;s someone out there for him, I&#39;m sure. That, 
or he has something for his pokemon...&quot;

She laughs, bright and bubbling. &quot;You have got to be joking!&quot;

I smile. &quot;About the latter, yes, but the former... he&#39;ll find his 
special someone, someday. I&#39;m sure he will.&quot;

&quot;What about you?&quot; she asks, and I close my eyes. I notice the shift in 
subject acutely.

&quot;I&#39;m really not sure. I mean... It would be nice to have someone,&quot; to 
have you, &quot;but it&#39;s more difficult than I&#39;d imagined. It&#39;s like the 
world is against me...&quot;

&quot;Do you really think that?&quot; she asks. There&#39;s a note of concern in her 
voice.

&quot;That&#39;s the way it seems. It&#39;s like I can&#39;t get a break...&quot;

&quot;But I don&#39;t understand that,&quot; she says, &quot;you&#39;re pretty, you&#39;re smart, 
there should be *tons* of guys wanting to get with you!&quot;

I blush slightly, and turn away from her and her vivid blue eyes. &quot;I 
thought the same thing. I waited and hoped and then... and then I 
realised something. Like a mallet over the head--what if I&#39;m not 
waiting for a guy?&quot; I ask. I know I&#39;m putting myself on the line here, 
but I have to. This isn&#39;t exactly something I could bring up with 
Satoshi and Kenji, now is it?

She&#39;s silent, and then she goes &quot;oh... oh!&quot;, suddenly.

I blink and look at her. She&#39;s hiding behind one of her hands. &quot;I&#39;m so 
sorry. I mean, it&#39;s not that you should be ashamed of liking girls, I 
just feel like an idiot for not having seen it at all... oh my, I&#39;m 
babbling, aren&#39;t I? I think I should shut up... shut up, Furura, shut 
up!&quot;

I can&#39;t help but smile. &quot;I guess that was sort of a surprise... I 
don&#39;t even think Satoshi&#39;s figured it out, you know. Kenji, *maybe*, 
but *never* Satoshi... I don&#39;t even know why I&#39;m telling you this. I 
mean... I don&#39;t know how you&#39;re going to react. You could hate me...&quot;

&quot;But why would you care?&quot; she replies.

&quot;And why are you even here?&quot; I retort. I&#39;m sure she must hate me for 
this... well, at least she won&#39;t have to worry about losing Satoshi to 
me.

We&#39;re silent again after that. She speaks up, slowly.

&quot;You&#39;re very brave. Even if you don&#39;t show your beliefs to the entire 
world. You still want to be the person that you *know* you are... I 
know I can be loud and obnoxious but I want to prove to my sister that 
I can do this. I... there&#39;s so much I want to do--I find myself living 
eternally in her shadow.&quot;

I sigh. &quot;Oh, you&#39;re not the only one--I have three older sisters, and 
I&#39;m the youngest of the Hanada City Gym Leaders. Believe me, it 
doesn&#39;t do well for one&#39;s ego to be known as the runt.&quot;

&quot;*Runt*?&quot; she demands. &quot;That&#39;s highly illogical! You&#39;re not a 
runt--you&#39;re gorgeous.&quot;

I blush. &quot;No, you shouldn&#39;t say that--if either of us are, it has to 
be you.&quot;

She goes to retort, but blushes instead. &quot;We&#39;re going to go on and on 
about this, aren&#39;t we?&quot;

&quot;I guess we fight well, that&#39;s all.&quot;

She goes to retort again, and then sighs and frowns. &quot;We got off on 
the wrong foot.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s understandable. Hey, look at Satoshi and I--now I can&#39;t seem to 
get rid of the kid.&quot;

Her face falls slightly. &quot;No matter what, he does mean something to 
you, doesn&#39;t?&quot;

I turn and look to the sea. &quot;He does. But he&#39;s just not the *one*... 
you know, the one I want to stay with forever. I know 
he--she--whatever, is out there...&quot;

And I&#39;d love to find her. I&#39;d love to find *you*...

&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure you will.&quot; She replies.

&quot;It might not be as hard as I think.&quot; I say softly, my fingers 
brushing near her own where they rest on the planks. &quot;Do you mind if I 
rest my head on your shoulder? We&#39;re going to have to leave soon...&quot;

She muses over that. &quot;No,&quot; she whispers in reply, &quot;I don&#39;t mind.&quot;

And so I rest my head on her shoulder and she slides and arm around my 
own. I can put this into three words--it feels nice.

&quot;I&#39;m going to miss you.&quot; I tell her, closing my eyes.

&quot;I&#39;ll miss you too, Kasumi. But we&#39;ll see each other again... like 
they say, good bye isn&#39;t eternal. It&#39;s not forever.&quot;

And I murmur in reply, that I&#39;d like that to be--for the mean time, 
though, I just sit and listen to the sound of the waves...

------------------------------------------------------------

For those who don&#39;t know--Furura=Melody. Kasumi x 
Furura=Fluteshipping. And no, I didn&#39;t make up the name, but I think 
the two of them are horribly cute together. ^_^;;</pre>
