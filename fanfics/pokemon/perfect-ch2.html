<h1>Perfect (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kanna.html">Kanna-Ophelia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/perfect-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Cassidy bent over to place a butterfree-soft whisper of a kiss on silky
skin, and Jesse made a sound reminiscent of a rhydon in a particularly
bad mood. 

Cassidy sighed and snapped on the bedside lamp. That was about it...
True love and perfection or not, she wasn&#39;t going to sit awake and alone
in the darkness listening to that kind of disgusting racket.  Not when
there was much better things to do with her time... She prodded the
other woman, hard, in the lower back. When it didn&#39;t work, she slapped
her rump, enjoying it rather more than she had expected. Jesse had a
particularly cute bottom.

The redhead spluttered awake, uttering threats of deep violence even
before she had regained consciousness. When she encountered Cassidy
instead of one of her partners, she stopped swearing in shock. There was
a still sweet moment, as the women gazed at each other, then memory
crept across the younger girl&#39;s face in dusky rose. It was beautiful.
And Jesse herself was beautiful, at least like this, her expression
almost sweet in its confusion of happiness and embarrassment.

&quot;It&#39;s you,&quot; she said, as if she could hardly believe it. &quot;Cassidy...
you... we...&quot;

It was the same combination of words she had used the night before,
after their first overwhelming, perfect kiss. Cassidy shivered at the
memory of the first sweet touch of Jesse&#39;s tongue against hers.
Suddenly she was terrifying of ruining it all, of going back to where
they had been. 

Instead of reacting to Jesse&#39;s wondering gaze, she said in her normal
sharp tones, &quot;Don&#39;t just sit there staring - make yourself useful. My
foot has cramp,&quot; she added, whiningly. She attempted a pathetic
tremulous growlithe look, even though she was afraid she couldn&#39;t quite
manage it. She was more of the houndoom type. 

Jesse laughed, the lunatic tinkle of her giggle less brittle and less
like Miyamoto&#39;s than Cassidy had ever heard it. It was almost... sweet.
&quot;Don&#39;t look so much like James. It&#39;s too disturbing!&quot; she snapped, but
her eyes had settled from wonderment into happiness, and the anger in
her voice was more habit than anything. Surprisingly skilful hands found
Cassidy&#39;s foot, working the tight muscles loose.

Cassidy had to ask it, despite the Flaming Moltres thing. &quot;Did you and
James ever wake like this?&quot;

Jesse&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Are you insane? James with a girl? Even one as
fabulous as me?&quot; She fluttered long eyelashes, glittering reddish-pink
in the lamplight now that they were unclogged by mascara.

Cassidy shrugged painfully, refusing to joke back. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen you
with a girl either.&quot; Jesse bit her lip, her cheeks darkening. &quot;That&#39;s
because you were always the only girl I ever wanted.&quot; 

And then Jesse&#39;s tongue was in her mouth, and on her throat and ears and
breasts in indiscriminate, wet hunger, and the cramp and uncomfortable
bed didn&#39;t matter at all.

Later, with her head pillowed on Jesse&#39;s breasts, Cassidy registered but
did not care that the air conditioner had died a noisy death at last and
the heat of their bodies pressed together was too much. What was that
compared to the delicious way something deep inside her would spasm
every now and then, sending shocklets of remembered pleasure through
her? She wasn&#39;t going to let go of Jesse if her life depended on it. And
the pressure of the arms crushing her, wrapped tightly below the
breasts, was reassuring.

Almost reassuring enough, but not quite. &quot;Jess?&quot;

&quot;Mmm?&quot; One hand released its death grip, to play in Cassidy&#39;s hair.
Cassidy dimly realised it would be badly disarranged, and she hated her
shooting stars coming awry... But if a vain little bimbo like Jesse
could cope with messy hair under the circumstances, so could she. And
there were more pressing matters to hands... A little, pulsating fear
under all her molten contentment.

&quot;Do you love me as much as you did last night?&quot;

Jesse pushed Cassidy&#39;s shoulders so hard she half-flew across the bed.
She propped herself up on her hands, staring at the bare mattress
beneath her and feeling her own breathing... waiting. Suddenly
terrified.

&quot;How dare you ask me that now?&quot; Jesse sounded furious; but then, she
generally did. There was no clue there. And it might even be guilt...

&quot;Do you love me?&quot;

Jesse had obviously been ready to yell again, but she met Cassidy&#39;s
desperate purple eyes, and hesitated. Softened. &quot;Of course I love you.&quot;
She paused, suddenly looking uncertain herself. &quot;Do you still love me?&quot;

Cassidy took her face between her hands, and stared hard. Then she
leaned forwards for the kiss. It was soft and hard at the same time,
lips only, sweet and intrinsically female and right.

&quot;I love you.&quot; Kisses melted into more kisses, Jesse&#39;s mouth opening
against hers. &quot;I -&quot; long kiss &quot;always&quot; - longer kiss, wetter - &quot;loved
- &quot; Their tongues pushed against each other, caressed, loved. Perfect.

&quot;Don&#39;t ask stupid questions, then,&quot; Jesse said, when they paused for a
moment.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Apologising always hurt Cassidy, and she tried to
compensate with a hard, flippant little explanation. &quot;I don&#39;t trust
perfect things.&quot;

Jesse tossed crushed-strawberry hair at that. &quot;I can see how you might
be intimidated by my perfection,&quot; she said complacently.

&quot;I said things, not people. You are certainly not perfect. You&#39;re an
incompetent brat who couldn&#39;t steal a pok&eacute;mon from a baby. And you
snore.&quot; Cassidy wasn&#39;t quite sure how they ended up in a tickle fight,
which only ended when Jesse kicked Cassidy rather sharply in the mouth. 

The blonde Rocket screamed rather louder than she had a few minutes ago.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry... let me look...&quot; Jesse offered, still giggling, and it
somehow turned into kissing Cassidy&#39;s bruised lips better. Which led to
them becoming rather more bruised, and another incandescent interval.

When she could breathe again, and the lamp was at last switched off to
give them some chance to sleep, Jesse&#39;s voice was soft in the darkness.
&quot;Don&#39;t leave me.&quot;

&quot;I - no. Jesse, why?&quot;

&quot;I thought - before, when you asked me that- you were getting ready to
leave me. Everyone leaves me.&quot; Jesse&#39;s voice was shorn of the usual
overly dramatic wailing with which she usually declaimed its sob stories
- it was quiet and flat.  Not a cherry blossom petal in sight, either.
Cassidy was sure this was not a good thing. &quot;Every man I&#39;ve ever been
with has used me and left me, just because I&#39;m... a bad person. Only
James stays, and we&#39;ve never... Well, of course we haven&#39;t.&quot;

Cassidy sought for adequate words. &quot;I&#39;m not a man,&quot; she said, which was
self-evident and ridiculous and didn&#39;t really answer the question, or
answer Jesse&#39;s pain. It was the best she could manage for now, though.

&quot;No - no, you&#39;re not a man.&quot; Jesse&#39;s hand slipped down a breast, almost
reverently. She had never done that to another woman. Cassidy felt
fierce pride at the thought. She tried again.

&quot;And if you&#39;re a bad person - well, so am I. Nobody&#39;s perfect.&quot; The
words weren&#39;t as difficult to say as she would have thought. &quot;And I
won&#39;t leave you. You are so stuck with me, babe. I love you.&quot;

&quot;I love you too.&quot; The tension melted out of Jesse, and she snuggled
closer. &quot;Everything&#39;s nearly perfect.&quot;

&quot;Nearly?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re still fired from Team Rocket.&quot;

Cassidy shrugged, feeling sleep inviting her, and not being inclined to
argue. &quot;We&#39;ll fix that. I understand Giovanni.&quot;

&quot;And James and I owe him too much money for him to consider letting us
go.&quot; Jesse giggled, while Cassidy smiled sleepily to herself, a sudden
thought hitting her. All of Miyamoto&#39;s unspent wealth must be somewhere.
Obviously Jesse had never got her extravagant hands on it...  So where
was it? Cassidy was sure her own mother&#39;s spirit would be very happy,
wherever she was, if Cassidy had a share in that insane miserly bitch&#39;s
precious money. &quot;And we still need to find a way to get revenge on that
little bitch for convincing him to fire us,&quot; Jesse added.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m good at revenge. And at getting my own way.&quot; Cassidy smiled
drowsily. &quot;I&#39;m more worried about us being on different teams... but
we&#39;ll fix that too.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Jesse sounded close to sleep too.

&quot;And the boys seemed a little freaked out by seeing us together... They
might feel betrayed. After all, we were very clear about hating each
other, and they backed us up rather well.&quot;

&quot;Oh, James will understand,&quot; Jesse murmured confidently. &quot;As for Meowth
and Butch... Well, they only want what makes us happy, right?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; Cassidy nodded. Butch would tease hell out of her, of
course, but he really was her best friend. He would support her when it
counted. She let herself sink deeper.

&quot;Besides.&quot; Jesse sounded awake now, and she flung one arm out in a
flourish, nearly knocking the dodgy Jigglypuff lamp from the bedside
table. &quot;Of course everything will be perfect. How could it not work out
for two perfect women like us?&quot;

Cassidy turned her head to kiss one of her lover&#39;s shoulders.

&quot;Damn right, Jessica. Everything&#39;s perfect,&quot; she whispered.

And went to sleep.
