<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/keepbro-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>Ash and May where taken to the boat that there where given to by Rage 
before he died, Ila was controlling the boat 

&quot;Ila what&#39;s going on?&quot; Ash asked 

&quot;You 2 r returning to Jetiendo&quot; Ila replied 

&quot;Why?&quot; Ash replied &quot;is this a way of punishing me?&quot; 

&quot;Sorry&quot; Ila replied &quot; I had a chat with Delia and Tasha about this, they 
didn&#39;t want it but they both agreed it was best all round&quot; 

&quot;SO THEY THINK I&#39;M A SLAPPER THEN&quot; May asked 

&quot; Of course not!&quot; Ila replied &quot; I think you are going to be great 
parents, remember Tasha just wants you to be safe, she wants to make her 
father happy by protecting you from peril&quot; 

&quot; I think I understand now&quot; Ash replied&nbsp;

___________________________________________________3 weeks later 

&quot;Hey Tasha&quot; Ash called out to her sister in the Jetiendo monastery, Ila 
was furious when she found out her step-son Ash got his wife May 
pregnant and continued to have sex and ordered Ash and May to stay in 
Jetiendo for a few days 

&quot; Hi Ash&quot; Tasha replied, &quot; How are you?&quot; 

&quot;Fine&quot; Ash replied, &quot;Tasha, I wanted to know could I go to the Oore 
region&quot; 

Tasha found it hard to answer that question because she vowed her dying 
father to keep him safe, the Oore region was dangerous, on the other 
hand this was his desire she could not deny him his desire, she thought 
letting him go with his wife would be the best thing 

&quot;Yeah&quot; Tasha replied, &quot;You can as long as you&#39;re faithful to the lord&quot; 

&quot;Thanks&quot; Ash replied now totally changing the subject &quot;Now Tasha&quot; Ash 
said to his sister &quot; have you thought about sex?&quot; 

Tasha&#39;s face was astonished &quot;sex?&quot; Tasha asked shyly as Ash picked up 
the bible, 

&quot; The bible is full of sex. Haven&#39;t ya noticed?&quot; Ash replied with a 
smirk on his face 

&quot; Ash&quot; Tasha smiled &quot; the bible is not the kind of book to make fun of&quot; 

&quot; The song of Solomon for example&quot; Ash laughed. 

&quot; No,&quot; Tasha explained, &quot; the song of Solomon is about a poem from a 
devoted man about God&quot; 

&quot;Wrong again sister!&quot; Ash exclaimed &quot;it&#39;s about sex&quot; Ash was looking for 
the right page, now you read it again&quot;
