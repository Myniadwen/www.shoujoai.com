<h1>Lavender Ghost Story (part 4 of 23)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nikolai.html">Nikolai Mirovich</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/lavender-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;Style, finesse, and of course... A REALLY cool car...&quot;

The musty room had stood devoid of life for more than a decade now. Only the 
faded footsteps in the dust proved that once a year, a human presence made 
itself known in the almost perpetually dark garage. Many of the tools that hung 
on the wall above the simple workbench were by now old and rusted. And as 
technology advanced most were left somewhat archaic. The few that were missing, 
had been requisitioned many years ago, and now only dust and the odd cobweb 
marked their passing.

In the center of the room stood a large, almost ominous shape. Hidden beneath an 
orange tarp and several inches of dust, the car waited with the patience of the 
inanimate. Beside it, a smaller tarp covered a lesser, but no less meaningful 
vehicle. The mountain bike&#39;s owner would never ride it again. Infact, neither of 
the machines owner&#39;s were likely to return to them. But such is the fate of toys 
left by children who have outgrown them...

Sunlight spilled into the room, chasing away the shadows that had lingered there 
for a year, undisturbed by human passage. But the loud, grinding protest of the 
old rusting door was ignored by the two figures who stood silhouetted in the 
doorway, their own shadows falling across the enormous tarp covered vehicle in 
the center of the room.

&quot;This is it,&quot; commented Miranda with a sad smile, her tone distant as she walked 
up to the car and ran her hand idly over the tarp-covered hood, &quot;my father&#39;s 
favorite toy.&quot;

Misty stepped carefully up behind her, half wondering if she should be careful 
to only stand in Miranda&#39;s footprints lest she upset the layer of dust on the 
floor. &quot;Can I see it?&quot; she inquired, her curiosity lingering more upon learning 
a little more about the man her lover put on such a high pedestal than on the 
vehicle itself. Cars were a rare thing outside of the larger cities, and were 
seldom interesting devices. &quot;Form equals function&quot; was something of an adage 
when it came to the small, cramped boxes on wheals commuters used.

The courier nodded, leaning down before the car almost reverently as she reached 
beneath the front bumper and untied the rope that held the tarp in place. As she 
stood up, Miranda pealed the plastic material back like a shed skin, revealing a 
vehicle that would have caused her Uncle Frank&#39;s growlithe to have a small, 
pleasant seizure.

The car was huge by any standards, but not dangerously so. It would still 
squeeze between the lines on any paved road, but its intimidation value alone 
would have made it a force to be reckoned with. It was also nearly twice as long 
as most cars, with two huge fins at the back that seemed to serve no true 
purpose other than style. 

Its collapsible roof stood out, a duller shade against the shiny midnight-black 
of its exterior, and the car&#39;s trunk seemed enormous until one saw the amount of 
space within the vehicle.

&quot;My father saw something like it in a movie when he was kid,&quot; explained Miranda, 
walking around the vehicle, caressing its surface with her fingertips almost 
affectionately as she went, &quot;And he decided he wanted one. He saved every credit 
he had for five years, before started construction. Uncle Frank even helped out 
a bit when they met about a year later, and when it was done they used to drive 
around Lavender like a couple of kids with a new toy, showing it off and causing 
trouble until they nearly got arrested.&quot;

Misty snickered at the irony as Miranda glanced up and caught her eye. &quot;And 
later on, it was in this car that he took that little trip my grandparents sent 
him on,&quot; the courier continued with a reminiscent smile, &quot;They were looking to 
retire in a few years, and wanted him to get to know our clients and stuff. 
Little did they know he&#39;d bring home his fianc?e.&quot;

Misty found herself smiling at the thought. &quot;I guess that&#39;s kinda romantic,&quot; she 
offered with meaningful look.

&quot;I dunno,&quot; Miranda confessed sadly with a shrug, &quot;I&#39;ve never been given the 
whole story. My father just sorta alluded to some kind of problem with Mom and 
her family. But I remember him saying once that it was bad. There was a 
certain... I don&#39;t know. Conviction? To his words that told me there&#39;s more to 
my maternal grandparents than I care to know. 

&quot;Anyway, they apparently met when mom was working in a restaurant, and my Aunt 
was studying under some professor of parazoology. He once muttered something 
about it angering him that anyone would treat their children that way. I 
dunno...&quot;

Misty had moved to Miranda&#39;s side, and was now clutching the courier&#39;s arm as 
she leaned against her. &quot;It sounds a bit like he was trying to save her,&quot; she 
said sadly, a tinge of anger entering her voice, &quot;It would seem that you&#39;re 
justified in your feelings for him.&quot;

Miranda nodded slowly. &quot;He apparently loved my mom from the first time he saw 
her,&quot; she said in a slow, careful tone, moving to embrace her beloved, &quot;And for 
the record, in our time together, I never saw him get angry. I never heard him 
raise his voice. No matter how much of a brat I was. But you could tell that he 
hated my maternal grandparents almost as much as he loved me and my mom...&quot;

Misty glanced up as she heard Miranda choke on her words, and felt her beloved&#39;s 
body shake. &quot;I wish I could have met him,&quot; she in honest sympathy, reaching up 
to wipe the tear from her lover&#39;s eye, &quot;He sounds almost as noble and wonderful 
as his daughter.&quot;

&quot;He, he also said,&quot; continued Miranda, her head on Misty&#39;s shoulder, breathing 
in the scent of her skin and feeling thankful to finally have someone who cared 
about her so much, &quot;That the only revenge that he would take up them, was to 
raise a child better than they did. Better than they could! To be the very 
antithesis of them...&quot;

&quot;I think that he succeeded,&quot; whispered Misty, holding her closer and feeling her 
own eyes well up with tears, &quot;for you to love him so much.&quot;

Miranda smiled, in spite of herself, fighting the urge to laugh. &quot;You&#39;re right 
of course,&quot; she both sobbed and chuckled, hugging her lover a little closer for 
a moment, &quot;But I don&#39;t think he can claim all the credit. My mom did a pretty 
good job too.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;d like to hear that-&quot; offered Misty, quickly biting off her 
impulsive comment.

&quot;No,&quot; assured Miranda, running her fingers affectionately through Misty&#39;s hair, 
&quot;you&#39;re right, dearest. I don&#39;t tell her that enough. And I really should. I 
just find it so hard to talk to her sometimes.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; 

Miranda shrugged, taking a deep breath. &quot;My father,&quot; she explained after letting 
Misty&#39;s question hang in the air for a moment, &quot;Was the most open handed, 
honest, approachable person you could imagine. Even more so than you!&quot;

Misty laughed, giving Miranda quick kiss on the neck. &quot;I&#39;m not that honest,&quot; she 
confessed, &quot;Do you know how often I&#39;ve lied to my sisters?&quot;

Her lover&#39;s chuckled response was reassuring. &quot;Yeah, but if you were absolutely 
perfect, you&#39;d be boring,&quot; replied Miranda, finding it hard to stay sad within 
Misty&#39;s arms, &quot;But seriously, my dad is... Was. Like you. An extrovert, I guess. 
But my mom&#39;s the complete opposite. And she has this way of looking at you, like 
she can see right into your soul and know exactly what you&#39;re thinking.&quot;

&quot;Of course she can,&quot; chuckled Misty, &quot;She&#39;s a mom!&quot;

Miranda laughed again, amazed at her lover&#39;s ability to say just the right 
things to put her in a better mood. &quot;I won&#39;t argue that one, but it&#39;s hard to 
talk to her, you know? I always get the feeling like she&#39;s judging me. Like if I 
come right out and tell her what I&#39;m feeling, she&#39;ll somehow think less of me... 
Does this make any sense at all?&quot;

Misty sighed thoughtfully, wishing she&#39;d had more time to spend with her own 
mother so that her words could be of more help. &quot;Well, you&#39;re father got past 
that, right?&quot; she inquired half rhetorically, &quot;He obviously wasn&#39;t sacred off by 
her when they first met... Was he?&quot;

&quot;No, of course not,&quot; laughed Miranda, lifting her head and staring reminiscently 
at the ceiling, &quot;He used to say that he found her eyes dark and mysterious. Like 
a locked treasure chest, deep in the heart of a dungeon, beneath the forgotten 
keep of a long dead king. Holding treasures so fast, so beyond the comprehension 
of mortal men, that it was his duty to bring them into the light once more, to 
show the world the beauty that it longed for. Or something like that.&quot; 

Misty gave her a quizzical look as Miranda leaned back with an amused smile and 
gave defeated shrug. &quot;I take it you get your poetic ability from him then,&quot; she 
inquired slyly.

&quot;Well, with my dad, it came and went from time to time,&quot; explained Miranda 
thoughtfully, &quot;His first love invention. This car would be more than proof of 
that if you knew what it was really capable of. Same with my mom, actually. It&#39;s 
one of the things that really drew them together. Although my mom&#39;s inspiration 
tends to be more in the area of defensives measures than large, bulky 
expressions of pent-up testosterone.&quot;

Miranda chuckled at the look Misty gave her. &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; she assured, &quot;the 
car&#39;s the only thing he&#39;s really ever &#39;guyed out&#39; about. Mostly he just made odd 
things... Like the alarm clock I still have in my room.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s it do?&quot;

&quot;Instead of ringing, it smells like bacon cooking.&quot; A slightly embarrassed smile 
crept across Miranda&#39;s lips.

&quot;What gave him THAT inspiration?&quot; laughed Misty.

&quot;Well...&quot; explained Miranda far too carefully, looking around nervously the 
entire time, &quot;There was this one morning when I younger when I came down stairs, 
and when he asked me what I wanted for breakfast, I got in kinda a huff and 
said. &#39;All I want is the SMELL of bacon cooking, and a tall glass of orange 
juice.&#39; Ah, kids!&quot;

Miranda could only smile as Misty gave he a look that said she wasn&#39;t sure 
whether to laugh of be disturbed. She eventually chose to laugh. &quot;I guess he 
took me literally,&quot; she continued, &quot;Same with that one Spring when I got upset 
because the bridge to Maiden&#39;s Peak was out.&quot;

&quot;What happened then?&quot; 

Miranda glanced at the car a little nervously. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t believe me unless I 
showed you,&quot; she responded, walking over to the vehicle and opening the door.

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me it flies,&quot; commented Misty with a bit of smirk.

&quot;Okay,&quot; chuckled Miranda, trying to sound serious, but not succeeding as she 
reached under the dashboard, &quot;I won&#39;t.&quot;

There was a loud -click!- followed by several other odd mechanical and vaguely 
hydraulic sounding noises from beneath the car. &quot;Stand back!&quot; Miranda warned 
hopping out of the car and backing quickly away as the vehicle rose slightly, 
followed by the sound of out rushing air.

A moment later, there was an ominous -thunk!- as the wheals turned inward, and 
folded up, yet the car remained the same distance off the concrete floor. A 
second later, and Misty saw partly why. An enormous black balloon made of a 
thick, rubbery material inflated its way out from beneath the car as a 
mechanical humming droned on for nearly a minute. By the time it stopped, with 
the rather clunky sound of the compressor powering down, the car had become 
something of a hovercraft. 

&quot;Th- That&#39;s really something else!&quot; stammered Misty, at a loss for words.

Miranda chuckled, a feeling of pride washing over her for a moment. &quot;And you 
should see what mom did to it,&quot; she added, &quot;Once he let her near the thing, that 
is...&quot;

&quot;It has a missile launcher in the trunk that clears traffic for you on the way 
to work?&quot; offered Misty.

&quot;No,&quot; laughed Miranda as she walked around to the huge trunk and popped it open, 
&quot;She just... &#39;Enhanced&#39; it a little.&quot;

Misty gasped in sudden panic as Miranda drew a sledgehammer from the storage 
compartment and slammed the lid down. &quot;You- You would-!&quot; she gasped as Miranda 
gave her a teasing smile and slammed the hammer down on the trunk with a mighty 
two-handed swing. 

&quot;See,&quot; she said beaming as the hammer bounced off without leaving a scratch, the 
sound of the impact still ringing in their ears, &quot;It&#39;s made of the same stuff 
that courier swords are lined with. And the paint&#39;s actually this weird organic 
compound Aunt Laurna cooked up. It regenerates!&quot;

Misty blinked loudly as she came around to the back of the car, running her hand 
over the impact point and feeling the heat generated by the impact, but finding 
no other evidence. &quot;Amazing,&quot; she commented as Miranda leaned the hammer against 
the far wall.

&quot;But its hard to find mithril in large quantities these days,&quot; admitted Miranda 
with a shrug, &quot;apparently there was quite a bit of it in the mountains above 
Lavender when our ancestors came here. It was one of the reasons the town was 
founded. The ghosts were a problem, though.&quot;

&quot;And thus the Tower,&quot; muttered Misty with a shiver, quickly chastising herself 
for the instinctive reaction. &quot;So,&quot; she said, quickly changing the subject, &quot;You 
mentioned going to Maiden&#39;s Peak?&quot;

Miranda nodded with a sad smile. &quot;Every Spring for their festival,&quot; she 
explained, &quot;well, except for the year that tsunami took out all of Route 12, of 
course. My Father&#39;d drive us down there, and every year Mom&#39;d be leaning as far 
away from the passenger side window as possible the whole way there and back. 
The bridge was smaller back then, and really rickety. She didn&#39;t really trust it 
very much, even after they rebuilt most of it Apparently that wave is a fairly 
regular thing, so I don&#39;t see why they just didn&#39;t just build Route 12 a bit 
better.&quot;

&quot;Once every forty years or so,&quot; muttered Misty under her breath, quickly 
banishing her own memories of that time. &#39;I so young and foolish,&#39; she sighed 
inwardly, glancing up into Miranda&#39;s smiling face and suddenly feeling better.

Miranda opened her mouth to speak, but her smile became a scowl as her watch 
chimed suddenly. &quot;What now?&quot; she muttered, glancing at it to see who&#39;d had the 
audacity to page her at that moment. &quot;Oh,&quot; the courier said with a small, amused 
smile as she read the number, &quot;It&#39;s mom. Bob must have lunch ready. Shall 
we...?&quot;</pre>
