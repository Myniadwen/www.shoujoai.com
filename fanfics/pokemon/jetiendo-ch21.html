Shelito Paz was relaxing on his yacht, stroking his mobile phone as if 
it was his prized possession pet. Then the phone went it was a phone 
call. Shelito Paz then answered the phone knowing that his younger 
sister was wanting to call.

&quot; Hello&quot; Paz called

&quot; BROTHER&quot; cried the telephone in a woman&#39;s voice

&quot; Floryte &quot; Paz groaned, &quot; It&#39;s you&quot;

&quot; HI&quot; squealed Floryte &quot; are you and Angelica going out?&quot;

&quot; Don&#39;t be silly&quot; Paz hissed with a laugh &quot;it is business. You know I&#39;m 
a busy man, Devoted to my job and all that lot.&quot;

&quot; Oh!&quot; Floryte replied through the phone, &quot; one more thing, can I have 
your clothes?&quot;

&quot; Not now&quot; Paz answered, &quot; I promise I&#39;ll come I to give you some 
clothes&quot;

&quot; Thank you&quot; squealed Floryte. She hung up. Paz placed his phone in his 
hands. Rushing the buttons selecting Lica&#39; on his phone and send

&quot;Shelito,&quot; said a voice of a man. Paz turned around it was his younger 
brother James in his team rocket uniform along with his friends Jessie 
and Meowth. Paz remembered the time when he ran away to avoid marrying 
Jessebelle. Now he was poor, evil and hopeless. Yet the three came with 
blood filled on their clothes.

&quot; Get in &quot; Paz announced &quot; get in quick&quot;

As soon as the four where all inside Paz was angry. &quot;I set you three a 
simple task,&quot; Paz snapped &quot; regicide&quot;

&quot; You killed King Marth&quot; Meowth hesitated &quot;he&#39;s a king. There fore we 
didn&#39;t need to kill &quot;

&quot; I meant the king of Jetiendo Henry Lilac A.KA Rage&quot; Paz hissed &quot; not 
the king of Hyrule.&quot; Paz walked around &quot; where are the clothes of Garnet 
and Shyst&quot;

&quot; Sorry&quot; Jessie &quot; we only got his glove and her hat&quot;

&quot; Perfect&quot; Shelito Paz announced, &quot; I set you another task.&quot;

&quot; What do you want us to do&quot; Jessie asked

&quot; Wash off my bloody clothes, and yours too. I a murderer you, my 
servants&quot; Shelito ordered, &quot; I have an opportunity with this war&quot; 
Shelito glared evilly with the dagger of which he killed Marth with at 
the three in his right hand and with his left foot he lifted the quilt 
and it showed the sword that gave Garnet and Shyst to God.

Paz then noticed Angelica was out the window. He stripped of his gloves 
and cloaks, as they where sequenced with blood he washed his hands then 
covered his hands with dark gloves a bran new cloak burst out the door 
then locked the door.
