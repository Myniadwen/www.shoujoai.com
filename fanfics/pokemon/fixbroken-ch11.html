<p>By the time Misty had finally calmed   down, the police had already reached the mall. Immediately, a burly   officer pulled Ash aside and began questioning him. Ash, however, knew   he didn't have the patience nor the time at the moment to talk. He had   to find Dawn and Zoey as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&quot;Look! I already told you I didn't   do anything! Now I have other things to attend to!&quot; Ash snapped   furiously at the officer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, showing a harsh attitude   did nothing but make Ash appear even more suspicious. Shaking his head,   the officer shook his head and replied, &quot;Listen, son, acting like   that isn't helping anyone, especially not you! Now, we need you to come   down to the station and-&quot;</p>
<p>As Ash and the policeman continued   to argue, Misty glanced over at Paul's body as a pool of blood formed   under it. Without a word, a nearby officer stood over the body with   a look of pure disbelief, tears streaming down the sides of his cheeks.   That was when Misty realized that man was Paul's cousin, who she had   met at a party once.</p>
<p>Looking around, Misty caught sight   of two or three more bodies lying on the floor, cold and unmoving. 'This   is so horrible...' Misty thought sadly, 'So many people were hurt...and   Paul...why...why did this have to happen?' Suddenly, she felt a hand   wrap around her own. Looking up, she saw that it was Ash.</p>
<p>&quot;C'mon...let's go...&quot; he   whispered as he pulled her out to the parking lot, somehow getting past   all of the police without being noticed. Once they reached the car,   Ash took off his hat and wiped his forehead. &quot;How'd you convince   him you didn't do it?&quot; Misty asked as Ash opened the car door for   her.</p>
<p>&quot;The police these days are nothing   but fakes nowadays,&quot; Ash remarked as he got into the driver's seat   and turned on the engine, &quot;All I had to do was slip a hundred-dollar   bill into his open palm and I was good to go!&quot; Misty didn't say   anything as the car drove out of the parking lot and moved onto the   highway.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of silent driving,   Misty looked at Ash and pleaded, &quot;Ash...listen...about what happened   four years ago at that contest...I didn't mean to get so upset with   you...I...I...just felt betrayed, and I-&quot; Ash cut Misty off by   bending over and kissing her powerfully on the lips.</p>
<p>When they separated, Ash quickly turned   his eyes back to the road and said, &quot;Misty...I'm not mad at you...I   never was. I blame myself for allowing May to have taken advantage of   me like that...I don't love her, Misty...I love you...and nothing will   ever change that...&quot; At this point, Misty couldn't stop the tears   of happiness that began to flow from her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Ash...I love you...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I love you, too...Misty...&quot; <br />
</p>
<p><em>Somewhere out of town...</em> </p>
<p>Harry Luxford, owner of a small gunshop,   had expected today to be like any other day, slow and uneventful. Instead,   he found himself trying to make a successful business deal with a psychotic   red-head. &quot;Listen, little girlie!&quot; he snapped, &quot;If you   plan on buying one of these hand-crafted weapons, you're gonna need   to act a little more civilized!&quot;</p>
<p>The red-head wasn't about to give up   however, it seemed. &quot;F-Fine...just give me a pistol or something...I   don't care...&quot; she hissed as she slammed money down on the table.   After showing her license and everything, the girl smiled to herself   as she stuffed the gun into her pocket and ran out into her car.</p>
<p>As he watched her drive away, Harry   let out a cough and thought, 'Hmm...Zoey, eh? Looks a little messed   up in the noggin, if you know what I mean...' <br />
</p>
<p>&quot;DAWN! ZOEY! ARE YOU GUYS IN HERE?&quot; </p>
<p>As Ash and Misty stepped into the apartment   complex, it became clearly evident that neither girl was present at   the moment. Misty looked around a bit and muttered, &quot;So...this   is where you've been living for four years? How depressing...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, crap! I was hoping that Dawn   had found Zoey and brought her back here, but I was wrong! This isn't   good!&quot; Ash exclaimed, his face covered in sweat. Suddenly, Pikachu   hopped out of nowhere and picked up a small folded piece of paper on   the table.</p>
<p>&quot;Pi! Pika Pika Pi!&quot;</p>
<p>Taking the letter from Pikachu's little   fingers, Ash slowly opened it up. His eyes barely scanned over it as   he started to read aloud.</p>
<p>&quot; 'Ash, I want to finish up our   little confrontation from before. Come and meet me at the docks tonight   at 8 p.m. Be prepared...' &quot;</p>
<p>As he looked over the letter for the   umptenth time, Ash's hands began to tremble. His entire body almost   seemed to be shaking with fear. Not fear for his own life, but fear   for others. Misty looked down at the letter, than up at Ash.</p>
<p>&quot;...Ash...please...please don't   go...you'll get killed...just like Paul! I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU!&quot;   Misty cried. Ash just slipped the paper into his pocket and turned to   Misty. Suddenly, his serious face broke out into a playful grin.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;You   always used to keep me out of trouble when we were kids. It would be   best if you came, too...you are the seme, anyway...&quot; This resulted   in Misty giving him a rather large bonk on the head. 'Just like old   times!' Ash thought as he rubbed the swollen bump that had formed on   his scalp.</p>
<p>'Still...it looks like it's up to Dawn   to find Zoey now...I really hope everything ends up all right in the   end...' </p>
