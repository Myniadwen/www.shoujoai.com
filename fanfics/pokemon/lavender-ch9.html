<h1>Lavender Ghost Story (part 9 of 23)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nikolai.html">Nikolai Mirovich</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/lavender-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>&quot;To Those Who Wait...&quot;

As promised, the upstairs bathroom of the Lilcamp household held an old tub, 
supported by the all too real looking feet of some monster the toes of which in 
wicked looking talons that held the whole thing up rather than threatened anyone 
with any physical harm.

The rest of the bathroom, however, was fairly normal by most people&#39;s standards, 
and would have been considered Spartan by the standards of Misty&#39;s three 
siblings. Most of the brightly lit, tiled floored room looked as it had since 
the house was built, with the only renovations being the installation of an 
overhead shower with curtain and the modifications necessary to make the room 
usable by Vivian. 

The water in the tub was pleasantly warm as the couple stepped into it before 
sitting down and letting themselves sink into the liquids soothing embrace.

&quot;This is nice,&quot; mused Misty, stretching out her legs to entwine them with 
Miranda&#39;s as she relaxed, her face looking flushed from the heat.

&quot;It&#39;s gone beyond that,&quot; added Miranda, feeling a smile cross her lips as she 
rested her head against a rolled up towel she&#39;d put on the edge of the tub for 
that purpose, &quot;But you know, this is the first real, actual bath I&#39;ve had since 
we hit Cerulean. Showers are fine and all, but I&#39;ve missed being able to truly 
immerse myself.&quot;

&quot;And this time I&#39;m here, so no one&#39;s going just barge in and try to seduce you, 
now are they?&quot; commented Misty teasingly, her toe running up Miranda&#39;s side in 
an attempt to tickle her before breaking the surface.

Miranda&#39;s body twitched instinctively in response to the sudden playful attack. 
&quot;Goodness, I hope not!&quot; she laughed, her arms moving to protect her sides.

&quot;Hm. I guess anyone else would have to stand in line, or something,&quot; her lover 
chuckled, glancing at the closed and locked door half-suspiciously, &quot;Only one 
person at a time is aloud to seduce MY Miranda, I&#39;m afraid.&quot;

&quot;And even then, it&#39;s a very short list,&quot; the woman added, leaning forward to 
dunk her head and thoroughly wet the mass of now sweaty tangles she referred to 
as her hair.

&quot;You know what this is like?&quot; pondered Misty as the courier came up for air, 
pushing her dark twisting locks back over her shoulders.

&quot;Like the first time we met?&quot; inferred Miranda slyly.

&quot;Yeah, like that time you took me to the hot springs. Remember that?&quot;

&quot;Oh! How could I forget!&quot; laughed Miranda, leaning her head back again and 
sighing reminiscently, &quot;I thought I was going to die...&quot;

&quot;Seriously?&quot; replied Misty with amusement.

Miranda nodded. &quot;It took a great deal of willpower and listening to my 
conscience not to take advantage of you that day...&quot; she confessed, glancing 
away and looking a little embarrassed by the admission.

&quot;Too bad you didn&#39;t,&quot; her lover teased.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s not like a part of me didn&#39;t want to,&quot; continued Miranda, glancing 
up as she felt Misty&#39;s legs slide against her own, the warm soapy water causing 
a particularly pleasant friction, &quot;But for one thing, I&#39;d lulled you to sleep. 
Not my intention, by they way. And if you&#39;d known the things that I wanted to do 
that day, you&#39;d probably would have dropped me like a stone...&quot;

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Misty pondered for a moment before sliding forward, &quot;but if I knew 
you then as well as I know you now, then no, I wouldn&#39;t have.&quot; 

Miranda smiled as Misty turned herself around in the spacious bathtub and 
carefully slid into Miranda&#39;s lap. &quot;Was it like this?&quot; she inquired, leaning 
back just enough to touch Miranda&#39;s breasts and purposely shuffling a bit to 
tease the woman before leaning back the rest of the way, &quot;With your arms around 
me, and I, thinking of nothing but how nice, and sweet you were to help out a 
stranger in distress, so oblivious to your dark designs?&quot; 

For a moment, Miranda felt a little guilty, but as Misty leaned her head back 
upon the courier&#39;s shoulder and ran her soft lips over Miranda&#39;s neck as she 
spoke, the feeling quickly dissipated. 

&quot;I&#39;d hardly call my feelings for you &#39;dark designs&#39;, my love,&quot; she chuckled, 
closing her eyes and concentrating on the feeling of Misty&#39;s body against her 
own, trying to recapture the moment, &quot;It was just that I was so enthralled by 
that quality you have. That beauty that transcends the physical, that even were 
I blind I could still have see it.&quot;

&quot;I think I sense some &#39;dark designs&#39;,&quot; Misty teased as Miranda turned her head 
to kiss her.

&quot;On your part, perhaps,&quot; the courier teased, &quot;But I think you know me well 
enough to know my true intentions.&quot;

&quot;Rather,&quot; replied Misty, her voice something of a purr as she teasingly kissed 
Miranda&#39;s chin, &quot;Infact, seeing as I do know you so well, why don&#39;t you tell me 
about that time? About all those unspeakable deeds that you wanted to perform 
upon your helpless victim, but were held back by your own morality and virtue.&quot;

Miranda felt a pleasant chill run down her spine as her body reacted of its own 
volition to her lover&#39;s words, making her feel more than very alive for one long 
moment. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t tease me so, my love,&quot; replied Miranda once she&#39;d 
composed herself, &quot;It&#39;s not polite...&quot;

&quot;Miri, my love, have I ever teased you?&quot; 

&quot;Not intentionally,&quot; Miranda replied slyly.

&quot;Then tell me,&quot; urged Misty, her voice taking on a pleading quality that caused 
Miranda&#39;s heart to nearly melt as she saw the hunger in her lover&#39;s sea green 
eyes, &quot;Show me what you had in mind, let me feel you caress me as though it were 
that day. Let me feel your lips upon my neck as though it were for the first 
time... Make love to me, my dearest Miri. Please, show me what I missed out on 
that day. Don&#39;t make me wait another half a year to find out...&quot;

All that Miranda could do, was press her lips against Misty&#39;s as her arms went 
about her beloved in a futile attempt to express her love, and to pour her 
passion into her lover.

&quot;Show me,&quot; whispered Misty breathlessly, her head leaning back against Miranda&#39;s 
shoulder once more, her hands grasping Miranda&#39;s and moving them to her breasts 
so that her lover might touch them, and her eyes reflecting a sudden need that 
even Miranda&#39;s words would have difficulty expressing.

&quot;There will never be a day, my love,&quot; whispered Miranda, playfully nibbling her 
lover&#39;s ear as her fingers relieved the aching need of Misty&#39;s bosom, &quot;when I 
find myself able to deny you such a simple request.&quot;

Miranda sighed contentedly, closing her eyes and blocking out all but the sound 
of Misty&#39;s voice and the feel of her lover&#39;s skin against her own as the warm, 
soothing water surrounded them. 

&quot;That&#39;s good...&quot; murmured Misty contentedly, stretching her legs out and sliding 
down slightly.

&quot;This?&quot; giggled Miranda as her hands cupped her lover&#39;s breasts before moving 
their widely spaced fingers teasingly towards Misty&#39;s nipples, &quot;Or what I said?&quot;

&quot;Does it matter?&quot; she inquired, inhaling slowly and purposefully through her 
mouth as Miranda&#39;s lips traced their way down her neck.

&quot;Kinda,&quot; the courier replied, gently holding Misty&#39;s nipples between two fingers 
as the others touched the trainer&#39;s bosom carefully until she wished Miranda 
wouldn&#39;t tease her so.

&quot;Mmm, then both,&quot; Misty sighed, bringing her hands up to cover Miranda&#39;s just as 
the woman slid them down, out of the way, chuckling to herself, &quot;Oh! Miri-!&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; inquired Miranda, the pleading sound in her lover&#39;s voice giving her 
chills as she brought her hands up to cover Misty&#39;s in the same fashion.

&quot;N-nothing...&quot;

Miranda smiled as she opened her eyes, watching as her fingers directed Misty&#39;s 
hands upon her beloved&#39;s bosom, causing Misty to gasp in surprise, and 
immediately blush as her body quivered in reaction.

&quot;Nothing, dear?&quot; Miranda asked slyly, moving one of Misty&#39;s willing hands 
downward across her stomach. &quot;Is there something wrong? Something you&#39;d like to 
tell me?&quot;

Misty laughed quietly, her breathing becoming ragged as she opened her eyes and 
peered down beneath the water to where Miranda was guiding her hand lower. &quot;No,&quot; 
she said simply, swallowing hard as her pulse raced and she found herself 
bending up her knees in anticipation, &quot;No, it&#39;s alright.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; said Miranda, her tone mildly serious as her fingers linked through 
Misty&#39;s before reaching their goal, &quot;Because I don&#39;t want to do anything to you 
that you don&#39;t like.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve yet to,&quot; admitted Misty, giving Miranda&#39;s fingers a reassuring squeeze 
before pulling her lover&#39;s hand lower and switching hand places.

Miranda smiled as Misty moved her head to look up at her, the look of love and 
affection in her lover&#39;s eyes making her body shiver. &quot;You know,&quot; she said, 
kissing Misty lightly upon the lips as she felt Misty&#39;s fingers coax her own 
downward until Miranda&#39;s fingers were running lightly across the smooth, soft 
skin of Misty&#39;s labia, &quot;This place feels like home again when I hold you.&quot;

&quot;Any place can feel like home to me when you do,&quot; finished Misty, her gaze a 
little unfocused as the feeling of Miranda&#39;s wonderfully gentle fingers drawing 
their way back and forth across her womanhood sent slow waves of sensation 
through her, each seeming to crash gently against the walls of her mind, slowly 
eroding her defenses until she found it difficult to concentrate on anything 
else.

For her part, Miranda let Misty&#39;s hand guide her movements, preferring to savor 
the moment. The feeling of her lover lying naked against her was both comforting 
and enticing, and Miranda found it amusing that Misty continued to touch herself 
as her hand left her breast, intent on simply holding her for time.

&quot;Do you love me?&quot; she whispered in a quiet, teasing tone into Misty&#39;s ear once 
her body had begun shake, and Misty&#39;s hand no longer guided Miranda&#39;s but simply 
clung to it almost desperately, as her breathing came in long ragged gasps.

&quot;Huh? Wha-?&quot; asked Misty, her mind only half grasping the words as her voice 
went up an octave as it always did when she reached the brink of ecstasy.

&quot;Do you love me?&quot; Miranda repeated, middle finger carefully teasing the line 
between Misty&#39;s labia as her lover opened her eyes and stared down at Miranda&#39;s 
hand.

&quot;Y-yes...&quot; she panted, Misty&#39;s voice taking on a desperate tone as the unceasing 
friction gave her a pleasant numbness.

&quot;Yes what?&quot; Miranda teased in amusement, kissing Misty&#39;s neck repeatedly as her 
lover&#39;s grip tightened about her hand and she felt her own body&#39;s need asserting 
itself in a most frustrating manner.

&quot;Yes, Yes I...&quot; began Misty, watching as Miranda lifted her hand slightly, and 
moved her thumb to where it just rested above her clit, &quot;I- I-!&quot;

&quot;You, you?&quot; inquired Miranda, her voice full of mischief as she could almost 
feel the anticipation radiating off her lover.

&quot;I love you!&quot; Misty all but squeaked as she gritted her teeth in and attempt to 
keep her voice down as her lover&#39;s thumb moved slightly and touched her now 
aching clit.

Miranda giggled in satisfaction as the slow rotations of her thumb against 
Misty&#39;s clit sent Misty over the edge. With a half-startled and quickly cut off 
exclamation, she arched her back as much as she could, holding the inviting pose 
for several moments as her body shook from the exertion of not crying out.

&quot;Right there?&quot; Miranda teased, never growing wary of the ever-growing variety of 
quiet exclamations her lover made at the point of ecstasy, especially when there 
was a danger of being overheard.

Misty&#39;s response was incoherent as she collapsed back down upon Miranda, 
splashing water everywhere, but not caring. Then, as the feeling subsided, and 
she floated down through the beautiful layers of rapture she passed through only 
to find Miranda&#39;s arms wrapped about her protectively, Misty smiled with renewed 
desire.

Without a word, except for the surprised laugh Miranda made, Misty quickly 
rolled over and straddled Miranda, her hands placed firmly upon the courier&#39;s 
breasts as she pressed her lips against the Miranda&#39;s without invitation.

&#39;So delightfully insatiable,&quot; the courier mused contentedly, as Misty&#39;s tongue 
seemed intent on making Miranda&#39;s mouth its new home and her hands ran about her 
body as though desperately seeking out a lost artifact.

It was then, as Miranda&#39;s arms moved to encircle her lover that she heard the 
odd gurgling noise of the tub draining, and the unpleasant coolness of the air 
touching her slowly exposed skin.

&quot;Wha-?&quot; she managed to stammer around Misty&#39;s hungry kisses.

&quot;Can&#39;t hold my breath that long,&quot; her lover replied, sliding her body downward 
over Miranda&#39;s as her lips descended, following the waterline with kisses until 
Miranda felt Misty&#39;s hands push at her thighs and Misty&#39;s tongue suddenly buried 
hungrily between them.

Miranda laughed, sliding up a little to give Misty more room as she tried to 
find space in the suddenly crowded tub. &quot;Hold on,&quot; the courier told her in an 
amused tone, struggling to stand as Misty grabbed at her legs, kissing and 
licking them teasingly as she tried to reach Miranda&#39;s womanhood, &quot;This isn&#39;t 
quite meant for that!&quot;

&quot;I... don&#39;t... care,&quot; Misty replied as Miranda managed to scramble out of the 
tub, her tone almost predatory as she leaned over the edge, her soaking wet hair 
falling over her face but not quite obscuring her almost feral smile. 

&quot;And I&#39;m not exactly running,&quot; Miranda chuckled, sitting upon the large towel 
they&#39;d thrown down on the floor previously and motioning her lover forward with 
her index finger.

&quot;Good,&quot; Misty chuckled, going upon her hands and knees once she was out of the 
tub and crawling towards Miranda with a predatory gait, &quot;Because it&#39;d be really 
embarrassing to run through the house, naked and wet to finally chase you down 
in the living room and have my way with you, only to find everyone watching...&quot;

Miranda laughed, covering her face to hide the embarrassment of the thought. 
&quot;Yes,&quot; she agreed, feeling Misty purposefully sliding herself up the courier&#39;s 
legs, &quot;That would be embarrassing!&quot;

&quot;Quite,&quot; Misty replied kissing Miranda gently as her fingers slid across 
Miranda&#39;s womanhood, testing her readiness.

The courier gasped as Misty slid her middle finger between Miranda&#39;s labia, and 
her inner walls gave way, the need she felt while caressing her lover in the 
bath flaring up as it came close to being quenched.

Miranda took a moment to catch her breath, leaning her head back to avoid 
Misty&#39;s needy kisses, and feeling her lover move them down her neck as Misty&#39;s 
thumb rubbed Miranda&#39;s clit in time with the motion of her finger.

&quot;But I- I think you&#39;d like that, wouldn&#39;t you?&quot; Miranda teased, giggling in her 
sudden euphoria as she saw her lover blush and take a moment to compose herself.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; whispered Misty so quietly that Miranda barely heard it as Misty took 
her nipple into her mouth, hoping to distract her.

Miranda&#39;s eyes widened, and she tried not to laugh, knowing that it would sound 
disapproving, even as she felt a sudden rush of elation at she unlocking another 
of her lover&#39;s secret desires. 

&quot;You know,&quot; she said in a conspirative tone as the air around Miranda didn&#39;t 
seem quite as cool, &quot;These old houses have strange ways of carrying sound.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Misty inquired, glancing up at Miranda as she withdrew her wetted fingers 
before moving to lie on her side upon the towel.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Miranda continued, her voice faltering slightly as she rolled onto her 
side as well and watched as Misty drag her wetted fingers across her tongue 
before drawing them into her mouth and making an approving sound, &quot;it&#39;s- it&#39;s 
the pipes you know. They carry sound quite well.&quot;

&quot;They do?&quot; 

&quot;Indeed,&quot; replied Miranda, smiling at the suddenly flushed appearance of Misty&#39;s 
face as she moved closer, pressing herself against Miranda before reaching down 
again, &quot;Especially when you&#39;re near them. Like on the floor for instance.&quot;

Misty nodded, her fingers sliding back towards Miranda&#39;s wetness as the courier 
obligingly bent her leg at the knee and put her arm around Misty. &quot;Then if, if 
we&#39;re too loud...&quot; she pondered, watching as Miranda&#39;s eyes lost their focus for 
a moment as she found a sensitive spot, &quot;Then they could hear everything, 
couldn&#39;t they?&quot;

Miranda nodded, catching her breath before speaking. &quot;Everything,&quot; she agreed, 
running her hand up and down Misty&#39;s back and kissing her to save her beloved at 
least some of her embarrassment.

&quot;I see...&quot; the water trainer replied after a moment, the battle between thrill 
and embarrassment apparent in her eyes.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Miranda encouraged, hoping she wasn&#39;t pushing her lover too hard, &quot;Why 
I&#39;ll bet, if we made too much noise, we&#39;d be heard all over town...&quot;

Misty gulped, her eyes widening as her cheeks flared red and she laughed to 
cover her embarrassment. &quot;I&#39;m such a pervert,&quot; she muttered, forgetting about 
sex for the moment, and simply flinging her arms around Miranda for the support 
she knew that she&#39;d find.

&quot;Shh, it&#39;s okay,&quot; her lover whispered, rocking her gently as Misty&#39;s thoughts 
conflicted, &quot;You&#39;re allowed. It&#39;s perfectly alright to be that way.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Misty whimpered, suddenly feeling terribly vulnerable as she lay naked 
on the floor, the warm fuzzy towel beneath them keeping the chill off the tiles 
at bay, &quot;But I- I&#39;m afraid sometimes...&quot;

&quot;Of what?&quot; Miranda inquired in quiet sympathy, taking a moment to roll onto her 
back with Misty atop her so that she could hold her beloved more protectively.

&quot;Of you thinking I&#39;m strange, I guess.&quot;

&quot;Dearest,&quot; Miranda replied sincerely, &quot;If that small little fantasy is the 
strangest, most perverse thing about you, I&#39;d hardly call that grounds for me 
calling you strange. I&#39;m not exactly innocent either, you know.&quot;

Misty laughed a little at the thought before hugging Miranda closer. &quot;I know,&quot; 
she agreed, appreciating the feeling of Miranda&#39;s fingers as they brushed her 
wet hair.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to worry quite so much,&quot; Miranda added, kissing Misty&#39;s forehead 
lovingly, &quot;Even if something you want to say, or do, or try embarrasses me I&#39;m 
not going to hold it against you.&quot;

&quot;And what would embarrass you?&quot; Misty inquired, a sudden smile crossing her 
lips.

&quot;More than you give me credit for,&quot; Miranda chuckled, vaguely registering her 
body&#39;s disappointment at the lack of release but choosing to ignore it.

&quot;Did my... My &#39;idea&#39; embarrass you?&quot; her lover inquired carefully, regretting 
her choice to stop as she pondered the possibilities.

&quot;A little. At first,&quot; the courier admitted, &quot;but it&#39;s so nice to watch you when 
you let go. It&#39;s beautiful in a way. Like looking past all the barriers and 
seeing the secret Misty within!&quot;

&quot;Then, then you don&#39;t find my shyness problematic?&quot; 

Miranda stifled a chuckle, blushing a little herself. &quot;Actually,&quot; she admitted, 
&quot;I think it&#39;s cute. Although it does amuse me that someone so fearless and 
upfront about everything else could be so shy about sex.&quot;

&quot;Lack of a decent roll model growing up, I suppose,&quot; Misty replied, wishing 
she&#39;d kept the bitterness from her tone, &quot;But it&#39;s better late than never. At 
least you have a better idea of what you like, and what&#39;s fun. That way you can 
teach me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m still learning myself,&quot; said Miranda with a reminiscent shrug, &quot;I was 
really only with one lover who knew a great deal. Or was at least willing to 
share that knowledge...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll have to tell me that story sometime,&quot; Misty teased, trying not to be 
jealous of something that happened before they even met.

&quot;Too bad I stopped writing in my diary a year and change before that,&quot; admitted 
the courier slyly, &quot;It might have made for an interesting bedtime story.&quot;

&quot;Would you read it aloud on stage in front of hundreds of people, though?&quot; 
chuckled Misty, leaning her elbows against the floor as she smiled down at 
Miranda.

&quot;Not a chance!&quot; the courier laughed, trying to hide her embarrassment, &quot;It&#39;d be 
hard enough trying to explain it to you! But...&quot;

&quot;But?&quot;

Miranda swallowed and took a deep breath before replying. &quot;But that&#39;s just 
because I love you,&quot; she said in a more serious, loving tone, &quot;And I&#39;d hate it 
if I made you feel the least bit jealous.&quot;

&quot;Is that why you don&#39;t want me to read your diary?&quot; Misty inquired 
sympathetically.

&quot;Partially,&quot; her lover admitted with a shrug, &quot;If you&#39;ve taught me anything, 
it&#39;s to live in the here and now, not in the past. We can&#39;t change it, but we 
can change the future. And that&#39;s what I intend to do.&quot;

&quot;Am I in that future?&quot; Misty asked, only half rhetorically, finding Miranda&#39;s 
never ending reassurances refreshing and addictive.

&quot;Yes,&quot; the courier said sincerely, her gaze intense as she spoke the words; &quot;My 
future has no meaning without you by my side.&quot;


Misty sighed contentedly; laying her head down, knowing there was no way she 
could compete with Miranda&#39;s often melodramatic method of expressing her love, 
but hardly caring.

&quot;Just, just one thing,&quot; said Miranda, shuffling uncomfortably.

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Um, this floor is really uncomfortable, would you mind if we got up now?&quot;

Misty laughed as she got to her feet and found herself an other large, fluffy 
towel. &quot;Well, I did notice that your bed&#39;s a whole lot more comfortable,&quot; she 
commented, wrapping the towel around herself and enjoying the sudden reassuring 
feel of the soft, fluffy fabric against her bare wet skin.

&quot;Very,&quot; chuckled Miranda mischievously, dawning a towel as well before opening 
the door and taking a quick look around.

&quot;Um, I was just wondering something...&quot; said Misty cautiously, causing Miranda 
to close the door again and turn to face her with a more serious look.

&quot;Go on,&quot; she urged, sliding her arms around Misty almost instinctively.

&quot;I, I was just curious as to whether you&#39;ve ever, um...&quot; stammered Misty 
nervously, changing the question at the last second, uncertain as to whether or 
not she really wanted to know, &quot;Just taken a date to the Festival before?&quot;

&quot;No one I was in love with,&quot; Miranda replied with a small smile, the assurance 
sounding grim as Misty touched the side of the courier&#39;s face sympathetically 
and gave her a sad look.

&quot;But,&quot; said Miranda with a self-assured smile, &quot;I don&#39;t intend to leave Lavender 
Town until I do!&quot;

Misty dealt with the sudden elated feeling she felt by kissing Miranda before 
reaching past her for the door handle. &quot;I&#39;ll be sure to tell you mom that,&quot; she 
giggled as Miranda&#39;s eyes went wide and Misty headed out the door, &quot;That way 
you&#39;ll never leave home again!&quot;

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t!&quot; the courier laughed, trying to dispel the sudden worry that 
struck her as she reached out for the suddenly fleeing Misty and grabbing hold 
of her towel instead.

&quot;Miri!&quot; her beloved exclaimed, suddenly finding herself completely naked, 
standing in the upstairs hallway, three rooms away from Miranda&#39;s bedroom as a 
the air around her seemed rather more chilly than it had been in the bathroom. 
From somewhere downstairs she could hear Frank&#39;s chuckle and the murmur of Bob&#39;s 
voice, as well as the almost musical laughter of a woman she didn&#39;t recognize. 

For a moment, Misty stood there, her thoughts conflicted as her arms held her 
modesty in place and Miranda stepped up behind her with the towel. &quot;Sorry about 
that,&quot; the courier whispered, intent on wrapping the towel around her beloved 
protectively.

&quot;No,&quot; whispered Misty, trying not to laugh as she stepped away and dropped her 
arms, the strange feeling of freedom sending exhilarating chills through her as 
she turned to face Miranda, &quot;It&#39;s alright.&quot;

Miranda smiled admiringly as she hooked her finger through the knot in her own 
towel, before letting it drop to the floor, to pool at her feet. &quot;If you must 
stand cold, wet and naked against the eternal void,&quot; she promised, moving into 
Misty&#39;s waiting embrace, &quot;then I shall stand with you. Unshielded, unclothed, 
and completely without embarrassment or regret. Your love shall be my shield.&quot; 

Misty sighed contentedly as she felt Miranda&#39;s naked body embrace her own before 
they kissed, hardly caring that at any moment someone could come marching up the 
stairs to see what was keeping them. 

&quot;I love you,&quot; Misty murmured into Miranda&#39;s hair, holding her a little closer as 
the sound of heavy footsteps downstairs caught their attention and made them 
both instinctively bolt for Miranda&#39;s bedroom.

&quot;Dinner&#39;ll be ready in about fifteen minutes, guys!&quot; called Bob from downstairs 
as they both noticed the enticing smell of lasagna wafting from the kitchen. &quot;So 
don&#39;t be too long!&quot; he added with a chuckle as Miranda slid her door closed, 
being careful not to slam it.

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; she breathed in a laughing tone, leaning against the map of Lavender 
Town on the back of her door, &quot;he knows!&quot;

&quot;So what if he does?&quot; inquired Misty with a chuckle, &quot;At least he was polite 
enough not to come up stairs to prove his theory.&quot;

&quot;Actually,&quot; commented Miranda with an amused grin as she moved to hold Misty 
once again, &quot;I&#39;m half surprised he didn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t even think that!&quot; her lover laughed nervously, the thought causing her 
already flushed appearance to deepen.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, he knows better,&quot; assured Miranda, giving Misty a little hug, &quot;But 
he was checking you out this morning.&quot;

&quot;No way,&quot; commented Misty, &quot;wouldn&#39;t you&#39;re Mom kill him for that?&quot;

Miranda chuckled. &quot;Actually, she encourages it,&quot; the courier explained, &quot;Mom&#39;s a 
lot more easygoing that she lets on. Or at least she used to be. Anyway, I 
wouldn&#39;t worry about it. She trusts him not to do anything stupid, and if he 
just happens to have a thing for stealing a harmless glance or two at a 
beautiful woman, then that&#39;s fine with Mom. Bob&#39;s loyal and faithful, and my 
mother knows that. I wouldn&#39;t worry about it.&quot;

&quot;Do you ever &#39;steal glances&#39; at other people?&quot; Misty inquired, keeping her tone 
teasing even as she chastised herself for her insecurity.
