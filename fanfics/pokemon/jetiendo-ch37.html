<h1>Jetiendo (part 37 of 38)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../pokemon/index.html">Pokemon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../pokemon/jetiendo-ch36.html">Back to Part 36</a><pre>TK and Kari got dressed; Mr Grinal tried to take them to Simon Cowell&#39;s 
office. They ignored him. It took 5 hours, Matt and Tai where shouting 
out &quot;Grinal&quot; across the church.

&quot;Matt, Tai&quot; Grinal snapped &quot;bed. Now&quot;

&quot;NO THANKS&quot; Matt shouted.

&quot;I shall not be speaker to in that rude fashion&quot; Grinal snapped

Then Jun came over running around chasing Matt

&quot;Shit, mother fucker&quot; Matt shouted

&quot; I do not want to hear language of that rude fashion,&quot; Grinal snapped.

Matt, Tai and Jun ran away returned to their dormitory.

TK and Kari walked quietly across the monastary, meeting Ant and Dec 
along the way.

&quot;Have you two had sex again?&quot; Ant asked then Simon Cowell and Mr Grinal 
came over &quot; disgraceful, here are the two sex maniacs, disgraceful&quot;

&quot;Very disgraceful indeed&quot; Dec replied.

&quot;Well thank you 3,&quot; Simon replied, I will sort these two out by myself, 
TK, Kari in my office.

Half an hour later, at the office. They could not be any more bored.

&quot; What you did is very disgraceful, appalling, wrong, and stupid,&quot; Simon 
announced, &quot;so you two will be separated from the others, getting 
therapists then a few days in rehab.&quot;

Their faces seemed pretty sad. &quot;You two are in a lot of trouble you 
realise&quot;

&quot;Yes sir&quot; they both said

&quot;Wait for me outside the monastary at 6 am sharp.&quot;

&quot;Dad &quot; Ash shouted with a blind fold on his face, Tasha holding Ash&#39;s 
hand so he doesn&#39;t hit anything kike a tree. &quot;Where are you taking me?&quot;

&quot; A surprise&quot; Rage replied &quot; I was hoping to give it for thy birthday, 
but it got damaged in the Christmas riots&quot;

&quot;It will be worth it&quot; Tasha replied

Rage and his daughter halted at a white boat. Tasha removed the 
blind-fold of her brother, Ash gasped with delight. All three entered 
the boat. Ash was very proud of the boat, he was even pleaser about the 
inside,

&quot;It&#39;s a bit shabby&quot; Rage replied as they looked around &quot;bu...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s perfect&quot; Ash interrupted, Ash flattered of what his dad has given 
to him &quot;why did you go all this way though?&quot; he asked

&quot;Because&quot; Rage stated, &quot;you&#39;re my son, I apologise on bended knee of my 
jealousy,&quot;

&quot;You will be there for the wedding will ya?&quot; Ash asked

&quot;Of course I will&quot; Rage smiled &quot; how could I miss my own prince&#39;s 
wedding.&quot;

&quot;Dad&quot; Ash whispered, &quot;I&#39;m illegitimate&quot;

&quot;That doesn&#39;t matter&quot; Rage replied, &quot;You&#39;ll always be a prince to us.&quot; 
Rage turned to Tasha &quot; and for you Tasha, you will be Queen hereafter,&quot; 
Tasha&#39;s face was quite shocked &quot; keep your brother safe&quot; he whispered to 
Tasha&#39;s ear, Ash heard everything and understood that Rage wasn&#39;t an 
evil guy after all, he wasn&#39;t as angry or cruel as people call him as. 
He&#39;s just like any other father.

&quot;See you tomorrow son,&quot; Rage smiled resting his arm on Ash&#39;s shoulder

&quot;See you tomorrow dad&quot; Ash replied.
