Samantha glanced up as the brush hit a snag as it ran down through her 
long, red hair. Smiling as she caught her mentor&#39;s distant gaze in the 
mirror before them, Samantha could see Erika&#39;s expression changing 
slightly as the tangle in Samantha&#39;s hair brought her back to reality.

&quot;They&#39;re leaving tomorrow morning, you know,&quot; commented Samantha 
half-teasingly, leaning her head back as Erika carefully retrieved the 
brush from her apprentice&#39;s hair and nodded thoughtfully. 

&quot;I know,&quot; the woman replied, smiling softly and leaning forward as she 
set the brush on the underside of Samantha&#39;s heavy locks, placing a 
small, gently kiss on her apprentice&#39;s lips, &quot;And there&#39;s little chance 
that we&#39;ll see her again after that.&quot;

Samantha sighed contentedly, her lips trembling as her body craved more 
than the small kiss she had been granted. &quot;Are you sure you wanna pass 
up your last chance?&quot; she inquired playfully, a small smirk crossing 
Samantha&#39;s lips as she held her eyes closed, simply enjoying the feel of 
her mentor&#39;s careful brushing of her hair.

Erika shook her head slowly and chuckled, giving Samantha a second small 
kiss upon the end of the woman&#39;s cheek. &quot;I have seldom been so certain 
of anything, my dear,&quot; the Gym Leader replied, the tangle in Samantha&#39;s 
hair almost undoing itself as Erika&#39;s nimble fingers unwove it as though 
it were nothing, &quot;Every relationship has rules, Samantha. Even ours. I 
know that you understand that.&quot;

&quot;Yes, my Lady,&quot; the woman responded with a teasing grin, opening her 
eyes dark green eyes once more as she reached back with both hands and 
slid her fingers through Erika&#39;s silky soft, dark black hair, pulling 
her mentor back down.

&quot;Although, even I must admit,&quot; said Erika softly, chuckling as she 
tilted her head to one side to accept Samantha&#39;s kisses along her neck, 
&quot;that even I&#39;m not made of stone.&quot;

Samantha tried unsuccessfully to distract her mentor at the comment, 
making a small, happily exaggerated moaning sound as her teeth nipped 
playfully and gently at Erika&#39;s skin. &quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; she agreed with a 
laugh as Erika suddenly and uncharacteristically dropped the brush to 
the carpeted floor, the woman&#39;s hands sliding down across Samantha&#39;s 
shoulders and chest affectionately to hold her bosom through the thin 
fabric of her pale green nightgown.

&quot;Please, dearest,&quot; Erika said softly, a heaviness tainting her tone so 
subtly that only Samantha had the talent necessary to catch it, &quot;make 
love to me, Samantha. Remind me of why I was able to just let her go 
that first time...&quot;
