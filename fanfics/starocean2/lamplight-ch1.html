<pre>Rena, Claude, and Celine arrived back into the town of Cross dirty, 
hungry, and worn out from their trials at the Cross Cave. However, 
they had retrieved the ancient writings and were in a joyous mood.

Celine stretched her thin smooth skinned arms when she entered the 
gate. She looked back at her two companions and gave them a beautiful 
smile that caused Claude to blush.

&quot;I want to thank you two for helping me out. I know that it didn&#39;t do 
any thing to help you find out any information about the sorcery 
globe, but I thank you from the bottom of my heart.&quot; Celine bowed 
flashing considerable cleavage, causing both Rena and Claude to blush.

&quot;Don&#39;t think nothing of it, Celine&quot; Rena said, running a hand through 
her blue hair. &quot;Glad we could help, and now that you have joined us in 
our quest, I&#39;m sure that you will be able to help us gather 
information about the Sorcery Globe.&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t you a sweetheart?&quot; Celine said, giving Rena a sultry smile. 
&quot;But anyway, I want to treat you two kids to a nice meal. They have a 
nice restaurant in this town called the Forum. After we clean 
ourselves up lets go. That sounds good to you two?&quot;

&quot;Sure Miss Jules that sounds great said the ever hungry Claude, 
rubbing the back of his head.

&quot;Oh Darling, don&#39;t be so formal call me &#39;Celine,&#39;&quot; With that Celine 
walked off, swishing her cute backside with each step.

Rena felt a bubble of jealousy at the way Claude&#39;s eyes were riveted 
to Celine&#39;s behind.

They arrived at the Kingdom Hotel and the proprietress gave them two 
rooms: a large one with two beds for Celine and Rena, and a smaller 
one for Claude.

After grabbing changes of clothing, except Claude who only had his one 
set of clothes, the three made their way to a public bathhouse that 
was nearby.

They entered the bathhouse, and were greeted by a pretty brown haired 
girl at the counter. After paying five fol apiece, they split up and 
headed to the sides of their sexes.

After putting their clothes in small wicker baskets in the changing 
room, Rena and Celine entered a large room that was full of steam and 
the talk of women young and old. The largest feature in the room was a 
massive stone tub, which was heated from wood fires down below, in 
which many women were immersed in after they had bathed themselves. 
With only small towels held in front of their most intimate areas, 
Rena and Celine made their way over to a couple of empty stools that 
faced a long shallow tub that held hot water. Before each stool was a 
small basket that held soaps and shampoos.

Rena sat shyly on her stool. She was not used to being naked around so 
many people even if they were all women. The only ornament she wore 
was her pendant that hung between her small but firm breasts. Celine 
on the other hand was not embarrassed being naked in front of a large 
number of women. She was proud of her taught body and large breasts 
accented by her Heraldic Tattoo.

Rena lathered up a bar of soap on a washcloth and started to clean her 
body, taking furtive glances at Celine. The Heraldic Tattoo was 
massive and Rena was sure that Celine had to have suffered a great 
deal of pain when it was tattooed upon her, especially on her breasts. 
Washing her arms, she watched Celine wash her large breasts. She 
blushed red when Celine caught her staring.

&quot;Don&#39;t be embarrassed, sweetheart.&quot; Celine purred. &quot;If I was you I 
would have a hard time keeping my eyes off of myself.&quot; Celine raised 
an eyebrow as if she were thinking if her words she had just uttered 
had made any sense. She smiled showing Rena her perfect teeth. &quot;Would 
you be a darling, dear, and please wash my back for me. Celine turned 
on her stool, and Rena got a view of Celine&#39;s muscular well tanned 
back and the swell of her full buttocks. Celine pulled her long 
lavender colored hair over on shoulder. &quot;Don&#39;t be shy, Rena 
sweetheart, I&#39;ll wash yours after you have washed mine. I just want to 
get the sweat and grime of travel off of me.&quot;

&quot;Sure, Celine.&quot; Rena said her voice not much more than a whisper. She 
got on her knees behind Celine, and lathered up her washcloth. She 
then took the soapy cloth and rubbed it up and down Celine&#39;s back. 
Soapy rivulets traveled down Celine&#39;s back and into the lovely crevice 
of her ass.

&quot;Ah thank you, sweetheart, you are wonderful Celine said filling a 
small wooden bucket full of water and then dumping it over her head. 
She then shampooed her hair and Rena helped her rinse off.

Celine then helped Rena wash her back. The younger girl was tense at 
first, but eventually let her body relax under the skillful fingers of 
the Heraldic Mage. Celine then helped Rena wash her blue hair.

Rena had never really considered herself attracted to women, but 
Celine had wedged herself into her heart like a grain of sand in a 
clam, and she could feel her feelings for the Heraldic Mage starting 
to turn into a pearl of love.

After they had rinsed off well, they entered the massive stone tub and 
immersed themselves in the hot waters. Celine sat at the corner of the 
tub and stretched her arms, causing her voluptuous breasts to swell.

&quot;Rena sweetheart, I have a question for you,&quot; Celine said in her 
sultry voice.

&quot;What is it, Celine&quot; Rena said. She sat pretty close to the Heraldic 
Mage. Entranced by the older girl&#39;s beauty.

&quot;Have you slept with that dear boy, Claude yet? It is obvious you two 
have a thing for each other.&quot;
 
Rena turned as red as a beet. &quot;No, I haven&#39;t slept with him. I&#39;m not 
quite sure that he likes me enough for that, and I don&#39;t know if I am 
quite ready to go that far I have after all not known him that long.&quot; 
Rena continued on like that for quite awhile, turning redder all the 
time. When Celine put a hand on her shoulder she jumped.

&quot;Calm down, sweetheart, I didn&#39;t mean to get you so flustered. It was 
just a question, but do be kind to the boy he is just as flustered as 
you are.&quot;

&quot;Okay, Celine.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot; Celine stood, stepped out of the tub, and made her way back to 
the dressing room. Many of the women in the room looked enviously at 
her gorgeous body.

In the other washroom, Claude couldn&#39;t stop sneezing. I hope I am not 
coming down with a cold he thought.

Rena and Celine sat in the bathhouse&#39;s foyer waiting for Claude to 
return. Celine had dressed in one of her skimpy outfits that showed 
off her freshly washed skin quite well and Rena was dressed in another 
short overall outfit.

Claude soon came out dressed in his one set of clothes.

&quot;We must really go and pick you up some more clothes, Claude,&quot; Celine 
said eyeing him closely. For both hygiene reasons and so you don&#39;t 
stick out as much.&quot;

&quot;Sure Celine, but can we afford to spend so much money on clothes. I 
mean shouldn&#39;t we spend more on equipment and stuff like that?&quot; Claude 
asked. He couldn&#39;t help blushing at the sight of Celine&#39;s flushed 
bust.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Mr. Claude. We got a lot of money from the Cross Cave, so 
we should be able to afford some new clothes for you.&quot; Rena said.

&quot;C&#39;mon darlings lets go back by the Kingdom Hotel and hurry to Rumor. 
I am famished.&quot; Celine said.

They made their way back to the Kingdom Hotel. Claude flanked by Rena 
and Celine. He got more than a few envious looks from the townsfolk. 
After leaving their soiled clothing, they made the long trek to 
Western Cross to the Rumor restaurant. They were greeted at the door 
by the lady proprietress, and were soon seated. Claude ordered steak, 
buttered red potatoes, and a tall glass of milk, Rena ordered a 
vegetarian dish, shortcake, and lemon flavored water, and Celine 
ordered baby rabbit risotto, salad, and a glass of red wine.

They luxuriated in the comfort of their soft chairs as they waited for 
their food. Rena had not known until then how worn out the trip had 
actually made her. They were soon served their food. Celine and Rena 
ate slowly savoring each bite of their hard earned meals, but soon 
were drawn to the spectacle of watching Claude wolf down huge amounts 
of food at break neck speed.

&quot;Claude darling, the food isn&#39;t going to run away. You can enjoy it 
you know?&quot; Celine said, a bemused smile on her face.

&quot;I am enjoying it. This is great. The best meal I have had since we 
left Rena&#39;s mom&#39;s place.

&quot;Well dear, if you like food that much maybe you should marry Rena and 
have her dear mother cook for you all the time.&quot; Celine smiled. Her 
lips hovered over the rim of her wine glass. Rena turned red again, 
and Claude choked on a bite of steak the man at the table next to them 
turned and whapped him on the back dislodging the meat, which flew 
from Claude&#39;s mouth and struck the wall. Celine sipped her wine. Her 
eyes sparkled with mischief and glee.

After the three of them were quite full they made their way back to 
the Kingdom Hotel. It had been decided that they would go to bed early 
so that they could get an early start to Mars village the next day. 
Rena and Celine and Claude made their ways to their respective rooms.

Rena and Celine undressed and got into their nightclothes. Celine wore 
a silk nightgown that clung to her curves and showed off the 
magnificent hollow between her breasts. Rena wore simple woolen 
pajamas. The only light in the room was an oil burning lamp that sat 
on a night table that was between their beds. Celine sat at a mirror 
brushing out her lovely thick lavender tresses and Rena was snuggled 
into her bed, relishing the warmth and softness.

Celine put her hairbrush down on the vanity, stood and walked over to 
Rena&#39;s bed. She bent down and looked into the young girl&#39;s eyes.

&quot;You have to forgive me, darling, I have always butted into others 
relationships. Ever since I was a little girl. I just want what is 
best for you and that dear boy. So excuse me darling I don&#39;t mean to 
be annoying. 

Rena looked into the depths of Celine&#39;s beautiful eyes. &quot;It is no 
problem, Celine, but I want to take it slow with Claude. There is 
someone else I care for as well, but I think that he only sees me as a 
friend. I know it is rude to hold off Claude for that reason, but I 
would like to know how Dias feels about me really first. Dias isn&#39;t a 
cruel person he is just a bit withdrawn, but I have seen him open up 
to me in some ways that I have never seen him open up to anyone else, 
so I want to see how it comes out with him before I get too serious 
with Claude because then I would always think about what could have 
been.&quot;

&quot;I respect your answer, Rena, but if you don&#39;t go with Claude and end 
up with your Dias, I wonder if you would have the same thoughts of 
what could have been with Claude also. I want what is best for you, 
Rena, I know that must sound funny coming from someone that you have 
only known for a few hours, but you are important to me, and so is 
that boy Claude. I have stirrings of my own for him. Very few men can 
be as natural with me as he is. They all have to put on a macho act. 
However, don&#39;t worry about me taking that blond boy from you. I&#39;ll 
wait and see if you get your Dias first.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Celine that means a lot to me.&quot; Rena said smiling a big 
smile.

&quot;You are so cute, Rena, Celine said. She bent don a bit and kissed 
Rena on her forehead.

The normally shy Rena was suddenly filled with warmth that went from 
head to toe. She lifted her head and kissed Celine&#39;s cheek. Rena 
wanted Celine then more than anything else. Celine returned Rena&#39;s 
kiss by kissing Rena on the cheek. Soon they were covering each 
other&#39;s face with kisses. Celine climbed under the covers with Rena 
and held the girl close.

&quot;Are you sure that you want to do this, dear?&quot; Celine asked pressing 
her body against Rena&#39;s.

&quot;Yes I am. This way I can fool around a bit and not feel guilty. You 
are a girl after all.&quot; Rena smiled and kissed Celine&#39;s neck.

&quot;You naughty thing,&quot; Celine cooed.

Celine threw back the covers on the bed, and started unbuttoning 
Rena&#39;s pajama top. After she undid the last button she opened the top, 
and reached down and caressed Rena&#39;s small breasts in her hands. Rena 
arched her back.

Celine ran her fine boned hands down Rena&#39;s chest, tight stomach to 
her navel. She then playfully teased Rena&#39;s navel by drawing a finger 
around its rim. She then reaches for the waistband of Rena&#39;s pajamas. 
Rena lifted her bottom of the bed and Celine slowly pulled off the 
bottoms and then tossed them to the floor. She gazed at the sparse 
blue hair that covered Rena&#39;s sex and smiled. Rena smiled shyly back.

Celine lied down upon Rena kissing the young girl&#39;s neck, sucking 
lightly at the flesh. Rena moaned softly in pleasure. She rained her 
kisses down and down Rena, bringing her hot moist lips down on Rena&#39;s.

The young girl kissed Celine eagerly back, wrapping her arms around 
the Heraldic Mage. Celine kissed Rena deeply, but pulled her lips away 
from Rena&#39;s. She moved her lips down a bit. Kissing the hollow between 
Rena&#39;s small firm breasts. She then took the nipple of the left one in 
her mouth and sucked on it lightly. Shivers shot through Rena&#39;s body. 
Celine started to lick he nipple caressing it with her tongue. She 
licked around the areola.

She then stopped and stood. She pulled the spaghetti straps from her 
arms and let her nightgown fall to the floor, and stood in her 
glorious nakedness. The fire of the lamp caused the Heraldic tattoo to 
turn a deep scarlet. Celine smiled down at Rena and Rena smiled back 
up. Celine retook her place on top of Rena, and inched down kissing 
Rena&#39;s body. She licked her breasts again, moved down to Rena&#39;s 
stomach and licked her belly button.

Rena arched her back in pleasure. Celine finally made her way to 
Rena&#39;s sex and spread the young girl&#39;s legs wide. She dived in with 
her tongue and lapped up the sweet juices that flowed from Rena&#39;s 
virginal vagina. She licked it deeply spreading it far, licking the 
clit. Rena was moaning in pleasure, rising and falling on the bed as 
jolts of pleasure exploded throughout her young body. She cupped her 
breasts in her hands, as Celine performed oral sex on her. When she 
couldn&#39;t handle it anymore she came on Celine&#39;s face, which caused the 
mage to lick wildly and the free flowing juices.

After Rena was all good and clean down below, Celine looked up at 
Rena. &quot;I think it is time that you return the favor, don&#39;t you think 
so dear?&quot;

&quot;Yes I do, Celine.&quot; Rena answered. The mage had made her feel better 
than she had ever felt in her young life.

&quot;Stand up, dear.&quot;

Rena did as she was told. Then Celine got on all fours, placed her 
head on a pillow, and lifted her lush backside to Rena. She reached 
back and spread her cheeks so that Rena could go deeper with her 
tongue.

Rena eyed Celine&#39;s vagina hungrily before she pressed her face between 
the Heraldic Mage&#39;s cheeks and sucked on her dripping vagina. Rena was 
not as skilled as Celine, but she was very eager to please, and dove 
in deeply with her tongue, licking at the mage&#39;s tight vagina. Celine 
moaned in deep lusty pleasure, and spread her buttocks more and to her 
surprise, Rena started to lick her asshole. Rena licked for all she 
was worth, sucking and licking Celina&#39;s anus. She lifted her right 
hand and inserted two fingers into Celine&#39;s vagina and pushed them in 
deeply. Sweat burst out from the mage&#39;s body and the scent of her sex 
was thick in the air. After several minutes, Celine came on Rena&#39;s 
hand. Rena moved up beside Celine, and the mage licked the girl&#39;s 
hand, sucking in her own juices.

&quot;Let me say, dear whoever gets you in the end has won a prize.&quot; Celine 
said, panting.

Rena only smiled.</pre>
