<h1>Quarrel</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../starocean2/index.html">Star Ocean</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hentaidye.html">Hentai-Dye</a><br> </h2>
<pre>There were many who called it a political marriage. A union based on a 
necessity for more factors to tie Airyglyph and Aquaria together as 
friendly nations. It was an old and universal tactic, practiced 
throughout the histories of dozens of worlds in the Milky Way galaxy, 
worlds that most of this planet&#39;s residents would never in their lives 
know the existence of. But even from the perspective of the average 
resident of Elicoor II, it was an old maneuver in international 
diplomacy to have royalty of one country marry an important member of 
another.

It was a persistent annoyance to Nel Zelpher that she could not honestly 
say that this view on the marriage between her old friend Rozaria and 
the king of Airyglyph was false. The wisdom behind the old saying, &quot;The 
enemy of my enemy is my friend,&quot; had its limits to how completely it 
could unite nations which shortly before had been at war. Though there 
were many who welcomed the new alliance between Aquaria and Airyglyph 
after so long and bitter a struggle, one whose painful consequences had, 
in one way or another, been felt personally by nearly every citizen of 
each country, there were yet many who could not see the wisdom of these 
friendly relations. Could not, or perhaps would not...many who had lost 
family and friends still opposed working together with the country they 
blamed for their close ones&#39; deaths. Others still did not trust the 
other side&#39;s wish for peace. And there were a few who had profited or 
stood to profit from the war, particularly the political allies of the 
late Airyglyph Dragon Brigade Commander Vox, who were naturally 
displeased with peace because it was, so to speak, bad for business. In 
the end, the catastrophic Vendeeni attack that Fayt had unwittingly 
brought upon Airyglyph and Aquaria could only be a catalyst for the 
start of a peaceful age between the two countries--it would take much, 
much more to maintain it.

So, with the pressure of building ties between the kingdoms that could 
withstand whatever trials the dissatisfied could concoct, Nel could not 
delude herself into thinking that politics had nothing to do with the 
ceremony that she was currently watching, in which King Airyglyph XIII 
was, as was in accordance to this ceremony&#39;s tradition, kneeling before 
his bride Rozaria, daughter of the high priestess of Aquaria. But she 
was adamantly certain that there was far more to this ceremony than 
simple international convenience. Rozaria had loved this man for the 
better part of her life, and that long-lasting devotion and affection 
was a radiant glow softly emanating from her joyful eyes as her mother, 
who was performing the ceremony, asked the king if he would from that 
moment forthwith recognize his bride as a partner and equal in love, 
life, and spirit, as was custom. Try as it might, the light that 
filtered through the church&#39;s many stained glass windows could not 
brighten and warm the room of worship as greatly as Rozaria&#39;s smile as 
her groom confirmed what her mother had asked.

And though Nel was not an overly sentimental person by nature, she truly 
wanted to believe that the happiness in the king&#39;s expression and eyes 
as he was bidden to stand was born of love as well.

The red-haired knight of Aquaria took her eyes off the ceremony for a 
moment to cast a sideways glance over at her fellow knight and other 
member of the Crimson Blade, Clair Lasbard, who was situated a few seats 
down on the same pew, squeezed between her father Adray and a recently 
promoted knight captain whose name Nel had not had a chance to find out. 
Adray had, amazingly enough, donned a shirt for this occasion. The shirt 
was, of course, far too casual to be appropriate for such an event, but 
his wearing one at all was a remarkable enough event as it was--Nel 
could only imagine how much trouble Clair must have gone through to get 
her father to wear it.

Clair seemed to be intently watching the ceremony&#39;s proceedings, so Nel 
turned her attention back to them as well as the priestess began the 
typical small speech acknowledging and vindicating the groom&#39;s promise. 
Queen Aquaria XXVII herself was a guest of honor in this wedding, so a 
number of Aquaria&#39;s finest military personnel were also present to act 
as an honor guard for her. Although she could have sat among the friends 
and family of Rozaria, being one of the bride&#39;s oldest companions, Nel 
had opted to take her place with her peers. She had done so out of a 
hope that she and Clair might have a chance to sit with one another, but 
seating arrangements had not favored this wish.

It had been more of a disappointment than Nel wanted to admit to 
herself. Opportunities to spend time with her lover had been few and far 
between during the war--real, quality time, that was, not simply 
exchanging information, making reports, and laying out strategies--and 
with the ensuing chaos after the Vendeeni invasion, then the time spent 
with Fayt and the others in ships and dimensions far beyond Nel&#39;s 
understanding, and now recently the immense increase in duties to 
protect Aquaria&#39;s well-being personally entrusted to her by her queen, 
the time that Nel and Clair had alone together had become next to 
nonexistent. Nel would, of course, never complain or even think to do so 
about how many tasks the queen was entrusting to her now--for Nel 
Zelpher, a sense of duty and dedication to her country was the greatest 
drive and emotion that she had. Still, she regretted how little she saw 
Clair these days. The romantic in Nel, the one most would never suspect 
she possessed, had envisioned her and Clair sitting together through the 
ceremony, holding hands and enjoying a small break from their 
near-constant duties.

But that was just how life was sometimes, and dwelling on this perhaps 
trivial disappointment would only sour what should be a happy occasion 
for all involved. Nel resettled herself in her seat, and continued to 
watch the ceremony.

***

It had been an enchantingly beautiful ceremony. Nel had not been to many 
weddings before, but she was certain that this had to have been one of 
the loveliest ever performed. Rozaria&#39;s mother had executed the ceremony 
flawlessly (of course, one could expect no less from Aquaria&#39;s High 
Priestess). But perhaps the most impressive part had been the High 
Priestess&#39;s impassioned speech at the end, right before she officially 
pronounced her daughter and Airyglyph&#39;s king wedded. Standing in the 
bright light, arms spread and reaching forward as though to embrace the 
entire congregation of people watching the ceremony, the priestess 
became the very image of the holy love of matrimony that she spoke of, 
with her daughter and her new husband standing before her as testament 
to this miracle. Nel severely doubted that even Aquaria I herself could 
have matched Rozaria&#39;s mother&#39;s pure, awe-inspiring divinity at that 
moment.

And then, there was the reception. It had been going on for roughly an 
hour now. From the highest ranking state officials to simple commoners 
who happened to be friends of Rozaria&#39;s, everyone was taking his or her 
time and enjoying this respite from a busy and tiring time for both 
kingdoms after so much chaos. People danced, ate, conversed with one 
another, and personally congratulated the bride and groom, who sat 
observing the scene with a quiet happiness. It was a true shame that of 
all the Elicoorians that had personally assisted Fayt in saving the 
universe, Roger was the only one who didn&#39;t have enough political 
standing in either Airyglyph or Aquaria to warrant an invitation, for 
the rambunctious youth would likely have enjoyed this event the most out 
of anyone. Then again, getting him and an ideal &quot;Man&#39;s Man&quot; like Adray 
together with the intention of festivities was probably not a very good 
idea anyway.

Oddly enough, though, Nel was in a foul mood, and had been since the 
High Priestess had finished her speech and everyone had come to the 
reception. She had sat through all of the reception&#39;s small festive 
traditions, and a short speech by Woltar, who was King Airyglyph&#39;s 
Guiding Man (being the closest that the regent had to a male family 
member or friend), all the time with an unpleasant sense of discontent 
and slight anger gnawing at her. She&#39;d tried to enjoy herself, to sit 
back, eat, and smile at the festivities around her, but found that this 
almost sickening discomfort only grew as she did. She didn&#39;t feel 
hungry, she didn&#39;t want to talk with others, and she didn&#39;t want to 
dance. Nel knew Clair would want to come and spend time with her as soon 
as the leader of the Shield Legion could be sure that she could safely 
leave her father to his own devices for a few moments without risking 
catastrophe. But she didn&#39;t even want to see Clair right now.

No, that wasn&#39;t quite right. She especially didn&#39;t want to see Clair 
right now.

To this end of total isolation from everyone else, Nel had quickly 
sought out Albel Nox to converse with. He leant against a far wall 
alone, and was likely the only person in the room who could possibly be 
enjoying himself less than she was.

Speaking to Albel was, as always, a slightly less rewarding experience 
than striking up a conversation with a wall. True to his personality, or 
severe lack thereof, Albel had felt that a single, disapproving and 
disdainful grunt to greet his former comrade had been a more than 
generous contribution to the sake of communication, and had not yet 
given Nel any further verbal acknowledgement that he even knew she was 
there (the haughty glowers, of course, left little doubt that he did, 
and didn&#39;t like it). Still, putting up the appearance of having a 
conversation with the man at least kept others from approaching her 
while she did so, whether out of politely not wishing to interrupt, or, 
for those that knew him, just not really wanting to be around Albel.

Nel knew she was being foolish, which only served to make her more 
upset. She felt guilty that she felt anything but happiness on such an 
important day for her old friend. She also knew that she was wasting a 
rare opportunity to relax, something that she had not been often able to 
do recently, and would likely not have a chance to do again for some 
time with the work load she had to take on--a chance she knew she 
needed, too, for her own health. And worst of all, Nel knew that she was 
squandering a precious opportunity to connect with Clair, who by now 
surely was wondering why her lover was ignoring her. These feelings of 
guilt and foolishness continued to only stoke the nameless, 
directionless anger within as the minutes passed--and Albel&#39;s sneer 
wasn&#39;t really helping the situation, either.

A small commotion temporarily distracted her from the dual distastes of 
her negative feelings and Albel&#39;s expression. Clair&#39;s loud and irate 
voice was cutting through most of the chatting and soft music as she 
began to chastise her father. It seemed that Adray had been in the 
process of yet again organizing some competition amongst several 
seemingly random men for the prize of Clair&#39;s hand in marriage. Apris 
only knew what the terms of a wedding competition would be. Maybe Adray 
had planned to marry his daughter off to the best dancer. As ever, Clair 
wasn&#39;t standing for her father&#39;s nonsense, and was delivering a small, 
completely exasperated speech that she would make her own decisions 
about this. It was not unlike many other speeches she&#39;d made in the past 
on similar occasions, and Nel doubted it would have any more lasting an 
effect than its predecessors.

Witnessing this scene made Nel feel more miserable than ever. She needed 
to get out of here and be alone to think.

Nel politely excused herself from her former 4D-fighting ally&#39;s 
presence, which provoked the closest thing to a positive response from 
Albel that she&#39;d gotten yet, and left the large dining room that the 
reception was taking place within. She passed by the door guards 
outside, reassuring their questioning eyes with a casual shake of the 
head to indicate that nothing was amiss, and then made her way upstairs, 
to the queen&#39;s throne room, and from there outside to the bright, 
greenery-wreathed balcony.

Finally outside with some space to herself, Nel breathed the fresh air 
in deeply as her eyes adjusted to the bright early afternoon sun&#39;s 
light. The tranquil setting helped to calm her, if only a little, and 
focus on herself, on why she was so upset. Part of what had been 
bothering her before had simply been the fact that she was feeling an 
unidentified anger and regret at all. Nel was a very controlled person. 
She liked knowing where she stood with herself. Regardless of what 
happened around her, she strived mightily to keep her cool and stay 
focused, controlled, a calm person. There were few people who could face 
some of the things she had in the recent past without panicking at least 
a little, and even of those few, most agreed that she was the most cool 
and collected at all times. Only Albel and Roger came close--but Albel 
had his moments of absolute, maniacal fury, and Roger...well, Nel wasn&#39;t 
always sure that the rascally youngster&#39;s head was quite right.

So for Nel to have lost control of herself to such a degree as she had 
was shocking to her, and only worsened the situation.

Why was she feeling this way? What was it that was making her miserably 
angry? Why was that speech the priestess made rattling around in her 
head? It was driving her crazy.

&quot;Nel?&quot;

Nel turned from gazing at the city of Aquaria to see Clair step out of 
the building behind her. She stepped out of the shade, and Nel had a 
chance to see her wearing her ornate crimson dress, fancy frills and 
tresses and all, in good light for the first time that day. The effect 
of the bright sun on the deep red which complimented the woman&#39;s dark 
gray hair would normally have been a breathtaking sight to Nel, but 
right now, all she could think was that Clair&#39;s choice to seek her out 
now was a case of uncharacteristic bad timing.

&quot;Hi,&quot; Nel succinctly greeted her lover.

&quot;Hello, Nel,&quot; she responded, smiling. &quot;Just wanted to get some air. 
Funny coincidence running into you out here, hm?&quot;

Her playful voice left little doubt about how much of a &quot;coincidence&quot; it 
was. Nel didn&#39;t respond, and turned back to looking out at Aquaria&#39;s 
capital.

Clair seemed to pay no attention to Nel&#39;s unusual aloofness, and came 
forward to stand by her. After a moment of silence, she said, &quot;It was a 
lovely wedding, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;

Nel grunted aloof assent, and mumbled, &quot;Probably all just for politics, 
though.&quot;

This was ridiculous. Why did she say that? She didn&#39;t truly believe 
that; she didn&#39;t want to believe it!

&quot;Oh come now, Nel,&quot; chided her companion, &quot;I know you don&#39;t really think 
that. Just looking at them...it was obvious they were getting married 
because they loved each other. None of the other reasons for it were 
important to them.&quot;

Why did hearing this make Nel feel even worse?

There were a few more moments of what was now becoming an uncomfortable 
silence, before Clair spoke up again, while moving to take Nel&#39;s hand in 
her own and give it a squeeze. &quot;I wish we could have sat by each other 
for it. It would have been nice. We don&#39;t get much time together any 
more.&quot;

Nel didn&#39;t squeeze Clair&#39;s hand back, nor did she look at her. &quot;Yeah. 
It&#39;s too bad.&quot;

&quot;Are you angry with me about something, Nel?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

This was true, at least. Even though Clair&#39;s presence and words were 
only making Nel more upset, and upset at being upset, she wasn&#39;t angry 
at Clair specifically.

Clair let out a small sigh of resignation and disappointment at Nel&#39;s 
bad mood. She refused to be so easily defeated by her fellow Crimson 
Blade&#39;s standoffish behavior, however, and tried again to make 
conversation. &quot;So how is Albel Nox?&quot;

Nel let out a small, mirthless laugh, finally actually looking at the 
woman beside her. &quot;Just as foolish and groundlessly arrogant as always.&quot;

&quot;Really? It&#39;s odd that you talked with him for so long, then.&quot;

There was a tiny edge to Clair&#39;s voice now. Under normal circumstances, 
Nel wouldn&#39;t have blamed her (or anyone else) for becoming a little 
impatient and annoyed at the way she was acting. Right now, however, all 
it did was to incense Nel, make her also start to lose her temper in 
response to Clair losing hers.

&quot;You seemed busy being auctioned off as a prize by your father,&quot; Nel 
said in retort.

This was absurd, of course; Clair had only become involved in that 
fiasco minutes before Nel had taken her leave of Albel.

Mentioning this did not improve Clair&#39;s mood, instead causing her to 
recall her annoyance over the ordeal from before and find a new focus 
for it. &quot;You know I&#39;ve told him a dozen times to cease that nonsense. 
But you sound like you&#39;re blaming me for it.&quot;

&quot;Maybe you like it. Having all those men competing over you, trying to 
win your hand in marriage...it must be nice to have that option open to 
you.&quot;

It was a credit to Clair&#39;s self-control that her voice only heated a 
little further as she responded, &quot;Nel, that is ridiculous.&quot;

Under normal circumstances, Nel would have agreed completely. Having her 
assertion called ridiculous, however, only worsened her already 
irrationally foul mood.

&quot;Is it?&quot; she asked sharply, now outright glaring at her partner. &quot;You 
don&#39;t seem to try very hard to get your father to stop.&quot;

&quot;I scold him all the time about--&quot;

&quot;He&#39;d stop if you just told him about us.&quot;

There was a sudden, furious silence, and even in her incensed state, Nel 
knew she&#39;d gone much too far. Clair&#39;s calm eyes of gray flashed with a 
real, honest, hurt anger almost totally unknown to them. This was not 
simple irritation over dealing with a stubborn and eccentric father, or 
upset disagreement with Nel over the latter taking too many risks to 
fulfill her duties. Clair was just wholly angry now.

&quot;Is that what this is about?&quot; she hissed in indignant fury. &quot;That&#39;s what 
you&#39;re ruining our time together for? Is that it?&quot;

Clair was very sensitive about the fact that she had not yet found the 
&quot;right time&quot; to tell Adray that she was already spoken for. Nel knew 
that Adray was not often an easy person to talk to, and more often than 
not, the scheduled duties of each of the dark-haired warriors kept them 
from seeing one another for extended periods of time. Thus, she had 
never before pressured Clair to tell her father about their 
relationship, and had often had to reassure Clair that she shouldn&#39;t 
rush it or feel guilty over it (though she did anyway).

So what Nel had just said was, ultimately, an emotional betrayal, one 
serious enough that the guilt that washed over her snapped her out of 
her ill temper.

&quot;Clair, I--&quot; Nel started.

But before she could speak any words of apology, Clair grabbed her arm 
roughly, turned, and began pulling her back to the entrance to the 
castle&#39;s entrance. Her grip was like an iron vice, her pace like an 
angrily charging Hauler beast, and her air like...well, there really 
wasn&#39;t any comparison that could accurately describe the way Clair&#39;s 
scowl permeated the air when she lost her temper. Having lost her own 
aimless anger and in the face of Clair&#39;s more focused fit, Nel didn&#39;t 
even think to try to resist until they were nearly at staircase leading 
to the ground floor of the castle&#39;s interior.

Finally coming to her senses a little, Nel tried (totally 
unsuccessfully) to pull away, protesting, &quot;Clair, what are you doing?&quot;

Clair didn&#39;t miss a step (literally) as she forcefully led Nel down the 
stairs, responding with a paradoxical tone both icy and heated, &quot;I&#39;m 
bringing you along so that you can see me tell my father in front of our 
friends, our subordinates, our superiors, our allies, and our queen that 
we&#39;re in love and have been for years.&quot;

They were at the bottom of the staircase now, and Clair continued to 
pull and furiously rant down the hallway. &quot;Then if he starts making a 
scene, which I am sure he will if he doesn&#39;t approve, and will even if 
he does approve, just about everyone important to us will be able to 
watch the show as I try to calm him down. Not the kind of setting I was 
waiting for to tell Father in.&quot;

Here Clair abruptly stopped and spun around. &quot;But I&#39;ll do it! If it&#39;s so 
important to you that you&#39;re going to hold it against me and avoid me 
during the first time in months--months--that we&#39;ve had to really enjoy 
each other&#39;s company for more than an hour, then I&#39;ll tell him right 
now!&quot;

Clair was a sweet, caring, compassionate person. But she was frightening 
when angry.

&quot;Clair,&quot; Nel said, looking her old friend in the eye, &quot;Please stop.&quot;

Clair did not calm down. But neither did she speak again. She simply 
stopped and waited, her angry eyes glaring into Nel&#39;s.

Nel looked away and said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Clair.&quot;

&quot;You should be,&quot; Clair responded, slowly and clearly.

&quot;I...I&#39;m not angry at you, Clair,&quot; Nel said in an almost meek tone.

&quot;Well, you had me fooled.&quot;

&quot;Look, Clair, I...I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve been in a terrible mood ever since 
this morning&#39;s ceremony, and I just...don&#39;t know why. And not knowing 
increases how badly I feel. It makes me mad at me, you, everything, and 
for some reason, it just seemed to get worse when I saw you, and you 
talked to me...I can&#39;t...I can&#39;t explain it. I&#39;m sorry about this, 
Clair. I really am.&quot;

The commander of the Shield Legion had also, by now, calmed down 
somewhat, and her voice was even as she chided, &quot;Well, you shouldn&#39;t 
have taken it out on me. That wasn&#39;t fair, and you shouldn&#39;t have said 
what you did. But...I forgive you.&quot; She sighed, then asked, &quot;When was it 
that you started to feel upset? Was it during the High Priestess&#39;s 
speech?&quot;

Looking back for a moment, Nel realized with some surprise that it had, 
indeed, been while listening to the speech that she had grown 
unreasonably angry. She had often said and thought that her lover knew 
her better than Nel herself did, but it was still eerie to her that 
Clair could infer this immediately.

&quot;Yes...it was right around then...how did you know?&quot;

Clair sighed again, this time regretfully. &quot;That speech bothered me, 
too. Nel, you&#39;re angry because we&#39;ll never be married, and the whole 
wedding, especially the High Priestess talking about it, is just 
reminding you of that.

&quot;When I heard her talking about marriage...it being the perfect way to 
consummate love, to show your love to others and each other...it made me 
feel very frustrated. It&#39;s not fair that people like us can&#39;t get 
married, no matter how much we love each other. I pushed it out of my 
mind so I could enjoy myself today, but it&#39;s been bothering you this 
whole time, hasn&#39;t it?&quot;

Nel was silent for close to a minute, looking down to the floor in 
troubled thought. Clair released her hand finally, then moved forward to 
embrace her gently. As Clair hugged her, Nel hugged back, and said, 
&quot;I...think you&#39;re right. I guess it upset me a lot more.&quot; She paused. 
&quot;No...honestly, I think it&#39;s been upsetting me for some time now.&quot;

The issue had actually been weighing somewhat heavily in Nel&#39;s mind for 
several months, ever since her travels with Fayt and the rest. During 
one of the periods of rest that the group had during space travel, Nel 
had decided to do some research on the worlds of her friends&#39; origins. 
Maria had helped her, showing her some rough basics on how to use a 
computer for such a purpose, and turning on a translation program to 
change the strange symbols that the Pangalactic Federation used into a 
language that Nel could understand. Among the many astounding 
revelations made to Nel during her journeys was the fact that every 
world in the interplanetary alliance recognized and practiced marriages 
between people of the same gender. It was one thing to wistfully imagine 
such an idea in a society where it was unthinkable and prohibited by all 
social and religious customs...it was another thing altogether to know 
that it truly was possible, and in that understanding, the sting of 
knowing that it would never be allowed here was tenfold worse. Clair, 
understandably ignorant that civilization the galaxy wide had allowed 
such marriage for hundreds and hundreds of years, felt some frustration 
and disappointment that had faded quickly--but it was small wonder that 
Nel would take Rozaria&#39;s mother&#39;s speech so much harder, because she 
knew.

&quot;It really troubles you that much, does it?&quot; Clair asked 
sympathetically.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Nel answered. &quot;I remember when we were children...you always 
really enjoyed pretending to be a bride, and you&#39;d gush about exactly 
how it would be all the time. You&#39;d get so excited...even as a teenager, 
you&#39;d sometimes still imagine of what it would be like, what you&#39;d wear, 
the decorations, the flowers...I just feel like...I don&#39;t know. It was 
always something you loved to dream about, and because of me, you can&#39;t 
have it. It&#39;s like I&#39;ve stolen it from you. I guess my guilt&#39;s why it 
stays on my mind so much.&quot;

This was true, if not the whole truth. Still, Nel couldn&#39;t tell Clair, 
or anyone else, anything about her travels, and what she learned about 
the universe and its people during them. There was no reason to, and all 
it could do was cause discord.

Clair tightened their embrace, laying her head on Nel&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Oh 
Nel...you silly girl. It was never the wedding that I dreamed of. It 
really is just like the priestess said...it&#39;s the love that makes it 
wonderful. Pretending and imagining was always fun...but the part that 
made it a beautiful dream was that it would mean loving, and being 
loved. That&#39;s what I really wanted, and that&#39;s what you give me, Nel. 
Stop feeling guilty.&quot;

Nel tilted her head to rest on Clair&#39;s for a moment, taking these words 
in slowly before eventually saying, &quot;I love you, Clair. I&#39;m so sorry for 
before.&quot;

&quot;I told you I forgive you. And I love you, too, Nel.&quot;

They broke their embrace, and stood staring at one another for a moment. 
Then Clair grinned playfully and gave her other half a quick peck on the 
lips. &quot;Although I can think of a way that you could make it up to me if 
you&#39;re still feeling guilty...&quot;

This time, it was Nel&#39;s turn to read her companion&#39;s thoughts (not that 
a total stranger couldn&#39;t pick up Clair&#39;s obvious meaning). She looked 
quickly around and realized that they&#39;d actually stopped just a few 
steps away from her own room. She motioned to her door, Clair let out a 
giggle, and they quickly went inside.

Once the door was shut and they had blissful privacy, Nel locked her 
lips to Clair&#39;s. She pressed awkwardly against Clair&#39;s lips, a little 
too forcefully, clumsily trying to match her partner&#39;s mood and 
movements, but never quite in synch with them.

Clair broke away and smiled. &quot;Goodness, Nel, you really are a terrible 
kisser. Just awful,&quot; she said with a playful titter.

&quot;I know. Sorry,&quot; Nel replied with a smile. No matter how hard she tried, 
she could never quite get the hang of it, always pushing too strongly or 
too softly, always taking it in the wrong direction at the wrong time, 
always a little too closed or a little too open.

&quot;Mmm, but you&#39;re my bad kisser, and I&#39;d never want a better one,&quot; Clair 
told her, for Nel&#39;s ineptitude at this most basic act of affection had 
always amused and charmed her.

The next couple minutes were an active blur of seconds to Nel, a collage 
of kisses and caresses to and from Clair, accompanied by clothing being 
carelessly undone to clutter the carpet. Nel only really came back to 
some clarity once both halves of the Crimson Blade lacked clothes, as 
she backed her naked companion toward the covered bed.

This light lapse in thought concerned Nel little, though, if at all, for 
this really was no time for the mental, only the physical. She and Clair 
had not made love for so long now, and Nel had been lamenting the lack 
of her lover&#39;s touch as truly as all her other qualities. It was all 
right to Nel, as she lowered her beloved lady to lie atop the bed&#39;s 
quilt, to lose herself for a little while in lust born of love.

As Clair lay, Nel allowed the ashen-haired woman&#39;s arms to raise and her 
hands to anchor themselves at her sides, caressing as before. There was 
an added tug to the caresses, an attached unspoken message asking that 
Clair&#39;s companion join her. Nel accepted, and came down to also lie atop 
the mattress, at Clair&#39;s side and wrapped in her arms.

Initiating another kiss, Clair moved in, inching herself toward Nel and 
increasing their proximity enough that their bodies lined up, intimately 
interacting through touch. Skin paradoxically soft and strong met 
identical flesh, legs hit legs, thighs met thighs, chests and nipples 
distended pushed together, all mimicking the mouths and lips which 
kissed, nipped, and licked one another. Inept as Nel might be, right now 
her skill was insignificant, for the intensity of their love and lust 
was high enough that it reconciled the kiss&#39;s inequality.

Clair reached around her lover, reveling as her fingers brushed across 
her lover&#39;s perfect frame at its firm strength, different from its soft 
appearance. She broke their kiss, and embraced her, pressing her palms, 
fingers, and wrists against Nel&#39;s back, tender yet with force. Clair 
brought her right hand lower, to explore her lover&#39;s lower back and 
rear, pressing, caressing, and even groping. Nel groaned in pleasured 
response to the pressure there, and Clair, encouraged, returned her 
right hand to its previous course of exploration, further down Nel&#39;s 
lean frame, following her rear curves to where her legs parted. Nel 
murmured happily at this relatively minor sensation, and Clair started 
to rub her fingers against the flesh they traveled a little harder. She 
arrived at her target a moment later, reaching the bottom of her lover&#39;s 
gender&#39;s center. A groan rumbled in Nel as Clair slowly and luxuriously 
traced the outer rim of this core, then graduated to a throaty moan as 
Clair maneuvered two of her fingers to enter. Another moan reverberated 
through her as Clair moved further and deeper, then another as the 
fingers retreated a bit, and more followed as Nel&#39;s warrior lover worked 
deeper again. These actions were repeated rhythmically over and over, 
and Clair observed with a sort of wonder and interest as Nel grew closer 
to a rewarding release, the increasing rate of her labored breath and 
body&#39;s trembles serving to inform Clair. Toward the end, when Clair 
determined that her partner was ready, she readjusted her hand, never 
breaking her pace, and relegated her thumb to firmly stroking the firm 
little nub which brought her greatest pleasure. Nel was never loud in 
the throes of orgasm, nor did she jerk and squirm very hard 
(unsurprising, given her generally controlled nature), but there was no 
doubt for Clair as Nel&#39;s grip on her arms grew stronger and her inner 
parts clenched hard on her stroking fingers. She worked her lover 
through her orgasm, then drew back when it was over, and allowed her a 
short time of rest.

Nel only took a minute or so before renewing their embrace and kiss. She 
knew that what Clair had done to her, and what she planned to do now, 
was nothing new, nor unique from other times they joined one another; 
yet it was never routine, for their connection, the knowledge of love 
shared, was enough to render each night, each experience as enjoyable as 
the last one, tinged with the spice of desire long kept dormant by 
necessity from both women leading incongruously busy existences. For 
Nel, it was Clair, and for Clair, it was Nel, that made these moments 
wonderful, not the kinds of actions they shared.

She broke her clumsy kiss then, as well as the embrace, to rise to her 
elbows and knees and move down the bed&#39;s expanse. Even though Nel&#39;s 
kisses left something to be desired, she was, oddly enough, really adept 
at orally expressing her affections elsewhere. She presently knelt above 
Clair&#39;s legs, and reached a hand to feel them, then gently pressured 
them until she had edged Clair to lie evenly on her back. Nel then eased 
her head down to the Shield Legion leader&#39;s legs&#39; cleft, taking a gentle 
breath there at her center.

Nel&#39;s tongue left her lips then, lazily beginning to lick a slow circle 
along her lover&#39;s labia, and a soft coo and pleased giggle leapt from 
Clair. Her lungs halted their lovely rising for just a split second as 
Nel called off her light oral tickling in favor of allowing her tongue 
to lovingly push past the lower lips of her lady and begin a more 
internal exploration. She gently stimulated the walls of this womanly 
cavern, the low rumbles and barely spoken calls of Clair guiding her 
oral dance, privately smiling as she listened to Clair&#39;s lusty sounds 
steadily grow louder. She lowered her head slightly again, giving her a 
longer reach within, but more importantly, allowing her small nose to 
brush lightly along her lover&#39;s clitoris, letting a new level of 
pleasure to overtake Clair. Nel&#39;s lover wriggled a little at the added 
bliss, and Nel did not let up at all, only increasing the rate that her 
tongue swirled and lapped, and nose carefully rubbed, until finally 
Clair called Nel&#39;s name and let go.

A few minutes later saw them quietly lying in one another&#39;s arms in an 
amiable silence. But even small moments of forever such as these had to 
pass, and Clair finally spoke after kissing Nel&#39;s forehead. &quot;I&#39;d love to 
continue...&quot;

&quot;...but we&#39;ve already been away from the queen&#39;s side for too long,&quot; Nel 
finished her sentence for her.

Clair nodded and sighed. &quot;We can&#39;t miss the whole reception.&quot;

They slowly rose to gather their garments, tidy up, and rejoin the 
others. As this process was started, Nel told her, &quot;I&#39;m...still really 
sorry for before, Clair.&quot;

&quot;I told you already, Nel, I forgive you,&quot; Clair replied.

&quot;I love you, Clair.&quot;

&quot;And I love you.&quot;

***

They rejoined the reception party, if not stronger in their love than 
before, then at least no weaker for their fight. The reception was close 
to finished, but Nel still had the time to warmly congratulate her 
friend Rozaria personally, as well as throw a somewhat less cordial look 
to her new husband that made quite certain that Arzei, grand king of 
Airyglyph, would suffer dire consequences were he to treat his wife 
badly.

Incidentally, Clair told her father of her relationship with Nel that 
week, perhaps feeling too guilty from Nel&#39;s comment that day (despite 
knowing that she had not meant it) to put if off any longer. He took the 
news well, knowing that Nel was of fine character and good breeding, 
congratulated them, and then immediately asked Clair when she and Nel 
were planning to adopt a son or daughter, which Clair of course told him 
they had not been and did not plan to soon start considering. 
Apparently, Adray&#39;s interest in his daughter&#39;s getting married had been 
motivated solely by the interest in having an heir to pass his legacy on 
to, so his constantly pestering his daughter did not cease with her 
announcement, only change from marriage to adoption. But it could have 
been worse, and now she did not have to feel guilty at keeping a secret.

As for Nel, though the knowledge that millions of others in her galaxy 
could have a marriage that she could not still weighed on her mind, 
Clair&#39;s reassuring words had made this envy inconsequential. She loved 
Clair, Clair loved her, and that was all that was truly significant.</pre>
