<pre>he Tolmekian Princess Kushana paused, her redish brown hair falling into 
her eyes as she drank a glass of wine. She was the ruler of her homeland 
now, her traitorous father dead and his schemes along with him, but it 
gave her little satisfaction. The cost of stopping him had been high, 
and she often wondered if it had been worth it.

&quot;You&#39;re drinking too much,&quot; Kurotowa noted, the dark brown haired man 
standing in the doorway of her study, his cape flung dramatically over 
his shoulder. Once a treacherous tool of her father and brothers 
Kurotowa had accompanied her to the Valley of the Wind and survived the 
mad adventures that follows at her side. Somewhere in the violence and 
madness he had become a ally, possibly even a friend. Mow he served as a 
sort of grand vizier of the royal court, a man who went between her and 
the nobles to get things done.

&quot;I&#39;m trying to run a empire,&quot; Kushana said to him dryly as she set the 
mostly full glass down, &quot;one made up of captured nations that mostly 
hate each other and us. I think I&#39;m allowed to drown my sorrows 
occasionally.&quot; Unlike his more flamboyant garb she wore just a tunic and 
pants, the only decoration a simple circlet on her head.

The Tolmekian empire had expanded by force of arms through the frontier 
nations by the Sea of Decay, promising to burn the polluted forests 
away. It was foolishness, though they didn&#39;t understand it until later, 
but by then they had already taken over many nations. Those, and other 
lands that the ambitious nation had forced under their heel. Once 
Kushana took over she found herself holding a bag of snakes that hated 
her, and each other too.

&quot;You&#39;ve already freed the frontier nations,&quot; Kurotowa noted reasonably, 
&quot;and you&#39;re even negotiating with those maniacs from Pejite.&quot;

&quot;Maniacs?&quot; Kushana raised a eyebrow, &quot;They&#39;re no worse than we were. We 
sought to revive a god from the past and they turned the Ohmu into a 
weapon... in some ways we almost deserved each other.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Kurotowa conceded the point.

&quot;Did you need to see me about anything other than my drinking?&quot; Kushana 
asked him wryly, offering to pour him a glass too.

Kurotowa waved that off as he smiled back slightly, &quot;The delegation from 
the border kingdoms is coming soon. I&#39;ll warn you once our scouts see 
them.&quot;

Kushana nodded to him as he left, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Kushana looked away, out the window of the castle at the capital city. 
The Empire had suffered greatly under her father&#39;s rule as he sought 
more and more power and added to that was all the damage done by the 
pollution the old ones had left, poisoning the land and killing so many 
of their kind. Ironically it was the aide from the conquered nations 
that was saving them, the border peoples teaching them better ways to 
grow food and survive. Like Nausicaa...

&quot;Oh,&quot; Kushana winced slightly, having spent most of the day trying hard 
not to think of that woman. Like a itch that she couldn&#39;t scratch 
Nausicaa lingered in her mind, the fierce woman dressed in blue who had 
so changed her life in the last few years. They had met on the 
battlefield, when Kushana had invaded the Valley of the Wind and she had 
been shocked at the fierceness of the girl.

When Nausicaa&#39;s father had been slain by a advance party the girl had 
attacked the killers with a ferocity that would have done any warrior 
proud. Despite being outnumbered more than five to one she beat them 
all, and was ready to face Kushana and her reinforcements too, if not 
for the intervention of the swordsman Yupa.

&#39;She hated me at first,&#39; Kushana mused to herself, picking up her glass, 
&#39;understandably too.&#39; Yet when Kushana&#39;s life was in danger Nausicaa 
saved her, and she had saved both the Valley and Tolmekia from 
destruction in the end.

Kushana swirled the wine around, thinking of the smaller brown haired 
woman, usually dressed in a simple jumpsuit. Her eyes could be so 
complicated, placid as the sea one moment, sparking with fire another as 
she spoke out for her friends and people. She had a unthinking charisma 
about her that drew you in before you knew it, leading you to follow the 
girl into possible death or worse without a thought.

Kushana got up as her mouth twisted in amusement, &#39;Or at least I can 
blame my infatuation on her charisma, rather than...&#39; She winced a 
little as old scars pulled, her body battered and cut by war and 
disease. Few people her age hadn&#39;t lost some part of their bodies to the 
poisons of the Sea of Decay, and her body was laced with many old 
wounds. &#39;I doubt Nausicaa has such wounds,&#39; she thought sadly, wondering 
how the younger woman might react to her many scars. Even with the 
girl&#39;s frequent visits and their growing friendship she hadn&#39;t shown her 
them, and she wasn&#39;t sure she would ever find the courage to.

Kurotowa was good enough to knock on the door this time before he swung 
it open, a slightly self-mocking smile on his face. &quot;They&#39;ve landed at 
the edge of the city,&quot; he informed her, &quot;they&#39;ll be here soon.&quot;

Kushana nodded, &quot;I&#39;ll be ready.&quot;

Kushana felt a oddly girlish impulse to primp and preen, but she 
controlled it ruthlessly. Instead she merely washed her face, tidying 
her clothes and silently wishing she had not had that glass of wine. 
Pulling on a formal cape she clasped it at the shoulder then headed out 
through the castle halls, nodding to various guards and staff as she 
went.

The sun was slowly dropping towards the horizon as Kushana reached the 
courtyard, shading her eyes as she looked up the roadway. Kurotowa gave 
her a smile as he stood with a few other officials, all ready to receive 
their guests. &quot;There,&quot; he murmured as figures appeared at the edge of 
their vision.

Kushana automatically registered the others walking along side her, but 
her eyes mostly focused on Nausicaa. Her hair was a bit longer than she 
remembered but she was as beautiful as ever, her gaze gentle and full of 
warmth. She offered official greetings to each representative, then she 
finally reached Nausicaa. &quot;Welcome to Tolmekia,&quot; she murmured, taking 
her hand.

Nausicaa smiled back as she held Kushana&#39;s hand in hers, &quot;It&#39;s been too 
long.&quot;

Kushana felt herself relax for the first time in days, touched by the 
welcome in those eyes. She only reluctantly let her go, aware of the 
other nobles quizzical looks. &quot;I hope our discussions will be profitable 
ones.&quot; she said formally, &quot;now, my staff will show you to your rooms.&quot;

Kurotowa murmured to Nausicaa, &quot;Could you linger a moment?&quot; Then with a 
gentlemanly air he led the others off, chatting warmly.

Nausicaa smiled up at Kushana as they walked inside, the two falling 
into step easily. &quot;I hear good things about your work in the damaged 
provinces,&quot; Kushana noted, her mind frantically searching for something 
to talk about. It was incredible that she had been looking forward to 
this for weeks but her mind had gone completely blank.

&quot;I&#39;m mostly passing on things I learned from the grandmothers in our 
village,&quot; Nausicaa admitted as they walked up to Kushana&#39;s rooms, &quot;but 
I&#39;m glad to pass it on.&quot; Nausicaa paused in the doorway to the study, 
&quot;So many books!&quot;

&quot;I started collecting them not long after I met you.&quot; Kushana admitted.

Nausicaa looked surprised, &quot;Oh?&quot;

Kushana smiled slightly, &quot;Meeting you made me question many of the 
things I had long believed to be true, and I wondered what else I might 
not know?&quot;

Nausicaa nodded thoughtfully in acknowledgment. Quietly she said, 
&quot;Meeting you has changed me, too.&quot;

Kushana looked at her in surprise, &quot;You&#39;ve always seemed very 
self-contained and sure of yourself.&quot; She chuckled, &quot;More sure than I, 
lately.&quot;

Nausicaa hesitated before she said, &quot;Before I met you I only had my 
people, the Valley and the creatures of the Sea of Decay.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure there were...&quot; Kushana started.

&quot;Duty kept me separate from the others,&quot; Nausicaa said quietly, &quot;and 
while I loved my father, I knew he was dying for a long time.&quot;

Kushana squeezed her arm, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s strange,&quot; Nausicaa said as she stepped closer to Kushana, &quot;even 
when I hated you it was a new feeling for me, something I treasured.&quot; 
The smaller woman reached out and hugged Kushana, pulling her close.&quot;

&quot;Nausicaa...?&quot; Kushana hesitated to reach for her, afraid that what the 
smaller woman might be feeling was different than her own feeling.

Nausicaa gave her a smile of love mixed with exasperation, &quot;Kushana, 
I&#39;ve tried to be patient, but you can be very thick sometimes.&quot;

&quot;Maybe I need some things spelled out for me,&quot; Kushana admitted.

&quot;I love you,&quot; Nausicaa chuckled softly, &quot;now kiss me, please.&quot;

And Kushana did just that.

End.

Notes: I&#39;ve always liked the relationship between Kushana and Nausicaa, 
enemies who forge a bond between them through adversity. The Manga also 
expands on that a lot, creating some interesting moments between the two 
of them. Nothing canon, of course, but interesting anyway.
