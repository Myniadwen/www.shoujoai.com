<h1>First Kiss</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hsgirls/index.html">High School Girls</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/demoneyes.html">Demon Eyes</a><br> </h2>
<pre>This takes place during vol.4 when Eriko got the flu~. I added some 
stuff that should have been included (according to me). This manga is so 
funny, though not as funny as Excel Saga manga., and I&#39;m really looking 
forward to it being made into an anime. Kami o arigatou-sho. I used some 
scenes from Vol.4 and this is my first complete ever fic. So please 
after you read, send me a pointer on how to improve my writing as I 
wanna do other rare pairings like;
1.Solty/Rose~Soltry Rei~
2.Elgala/Umi, Excel/Hyatt~Excel Saga Manga~
3.Chitose/Milfie, Milfie/Ranpha, Mint/Vanilla~Galaxy Angel~
4.Saya/Kaori~Blood+
And 
5.Nanoha/Fate~MGLN A&#39;s

Enjoy
  
**********

The bell rang signalling the start of lunch break at Saki Girls High. 
Everyone was in good spirits getting ready to enjoy their meals, 
well...everybody but one. Eriko Takahashi was not having a very pleasant 
day. &quot;Hugh...it&#39;s freezing&quot;. She complained holding her arms around 
herself, knees shaking and knocking against each other while her teeth 
rattled. Yuma, her best friend, was sitting near the heater at the 
window of the class with their new friend Kouda. They had put their 
bentos on the heater to warm their meals up as the winter season was 
just kicking in.

&quot;Eriko, come here. Right in front of the heater.&quot; Said Yuma invitingly 
as she started on her lunch sitting on a chair under one of the four 
tables that were stuck together in a big square near the heater while 
Kouda was on the opposite side of Yuma.

&quot;Your lunch is warm now&quot;, added Kouda, the O.G (old girl) of Saki high 
since she had been going to this same school since elementary. Saki had 
the escalation system but since Eriko, Yuma and Yuma&#39;s childhood friend 
Ayano came from a different junior high, they were some what &#39;new&#39; here. 
Kouda had become their first friend here as it would&#39;ve been difficult 
to get along with girls that knew each other all those years yet you 
knew nothing about them and what they talked about as they reminisced 
about their earlier years. Though their friendship wasn&#39;t at all that 
easy to make. It was sprouted from a lot of teasing. Since this was an 
all girl&#39;s school, Kouda had some &#39;guy trouble&#39; and after Eriko and the 
gang bluffed her about them having had tones of boy friends, she had 
clang to them in hopes of them hooking her up with some boys. But of 
course she soon found out the truth.

&quot;Yay. Hot lunches are one of the perks for winter&quot;, said Eriko excitedly 
as she skipped over to her friends. Apparently, the cold forgotten. Upon 
opening the lid of her lunch box however, she broke out into bitter 
tears. The reason &quot;Crap. I did it!! Hot strawberries and hot petit 
tomatoes!! AND SALAD INCLUDED ON TOP OF THAT...!!!&quot; She said, crying 
even more now. (These foods aren&#39;t meant to be taken hot)

&quot;Oh my, it&#39;s because you heated it up without checking what&#39;s inside. 
...but then I did it too.&quot; Said Kouda. What&#39;s that you ask, &quot;I forgot to 
take out the diet coke from my lunch box&quot;. Sweet tears. And, &quot;It&#39;s like 
five seconds away from exploding. Is there anyone else out there brave 
enough to open this?&quot; She asked as she held a bulging can on the blink 
of turning nuclear.

Yuma and Eriko were on there feet running away from her screaming, 
&quot;Everyone, get away from Kouda. She&#39;s holding a hazardous item&quot;. Later 
when they had calmed down enough to enjoy their lunches Eriko gave in, &quot; 
It&#39;s okay...I will just have to suck it up and eat the hot 
strawberries&quot;. Her face a painful expression.

Yuma who was sitting beside her looked over to her with a worried and 
sympathetic look, &quot;Have fun&quot;. She said.

Eriko started on her food but as she chewed, she was baffled when, &quot; It 
doesn&#39;t taste like anything&quot;, she observed.

&quot;What? No way.&quot; Yuma was surprised at the news. But of course it might 
have been that heating food that was meant to be eaten cold took away 
the taste. But of course no body thought of that. Though, it was not the 
cause in this particular case.

&quot;Hey Eriko, could it be that you don&#39;t have a sense of taste?&quot; Provided 
Ayano who had joined the group for lunch.

This really got to Yuma who quickly thought of many things. First, Eriko 
wasn&#39;t as energetic as usual this morning and she was shivering from the 
cold just a few minutes ago. She belated herself for not bringing that 
up sooner. &#39;Could it be...&#39; she thought quickly as she put her hand 
behind a surprised Eriko&#39;s head and gently but swiftly brought their 
foreheads together to feel for what she feared her friend had.  But as 
their fore heads touched and their eyes met for the first time at this 
close a distance, something gave way from deep within the unknown just 
like that first day if their junior high. She looked deep within those 
large pools of her friend and felt her body craving for something, 
something she didn&#39;t know. But which she thought she might get if it 
weren&#39;t for this fore head...&#39;Fore head?!!&#39; She thought. That&#39;s when she 
was reminded of  the original purpose of this closeness in the first 
place. She pulled away after having a taste of the heat from her 
friend&#39;s fore head that made it seem as if she had been standing in 
direct sunlight in the heat of the summer. But this being winter meant &quot; 
...crap. She&#39;s hot&quot;. She told her friends that were awaiting her 
deduction

......................................

In the infirmary, Yuma and Eriko were greeted not by the school nurse 
but by Yuma&#39;s younger sister Momoka. The teachers were in the board 
meeting at the moment except one who was left in the stuff room as an 
emergence. After they told the problem to the stand-in nurse, her 
advice? &quot;Oh, she&#39;s got a fever? Wash up some pickled plum and put them 
on your temples or something. That is all.&quot;. With a smirk.

Eriko was speechless. &quot; I&#39;m sorry, Eriko. I will make sure to beat her 
up later&quot;. Yuma offered but seeing her friend in this condition got her 
agitated and she went on her younger sister now. &quot;Damn it. Get to work, 
you medical committee volunteer you.&quot;. She reprimanded her sister.

&quot;What?! I got stuck with this position &#39;cause I lost a game in class. I 
didn&#39;t wanna do it &#39;cause it takes up my lunch time&quot;. She whined to her 
aneki. Apparently she had no medical knowledge whatsoever. 

&quot;It&#39;s okay Yuma. It&#39;s not so bad.&quot;. Eriko tried to decrease the worry 
her friend had over her. &quot; See, I&#39;m totally fine&quot;. She gave a weak smile 
as an assurance but it was a weak smile. And Eriko never did weak. 

&quot;...Eriko, what happened in 794 A.D?&quot; Yuma decided to measure just how 
&#39;fine&#39;, her friend was by asking her a question the answer to which 
would be known by anyone in their class and Eriko was the brightest one 
so she ought to know. That time was when the &#39;peace period&#39; began but 
Eriko&#39;s answer of a famous game character got her a letter &#39;H&#39; which has 
never seen the likes of paper as a grade mark. Yuma pushed her off to 
lie down on the bed.

Our stand-in nurse came to her great Nobel Prize discovery of the day,&quot; 
I guess she is sick&quot; which earned her a kick in the behind from her 
sister for her research.

Yuma went over to her friend on the bed, &quot;I&#39;m gonna take your 
temperature, so make yourself comfortable&quot;. She told her as Eriko took 
off her jacket and shirt. &quot;Here. Lie down. I&#39;m gonna unhook your bra. 
Did you get the thermometer in there? (Meaning the arm pit)&quot;. While she 
was reading the temperature, she had somehow ended up over Eriko, knees 
and hands on either side of her on the bed. That is the scene that Ayano 
and Kouda, who had come to check on their friend, walked in on.

&quot;Hey Yuma! How is Eriko doing?&quot; Ayano asked as they came into the room 
but froze on the spot by the view they were greeted with. Yuma on all 
fours over a bra-only wearing Eriko. As is their complicated 
relationship, Ayano ran off shouting an &quot;I hate you Yuma&quot;. And Yuma 
calling her best friend back trying to say that it was all a 
misunderstanding.

Having calmed down enough, just as Eriko thought that she might perhaps 
now get some rest but alas, all was chaos again when their friends found 
out that Eriko had flu. 
Momoka went to the door to the infirmary to put up a warning sign that 
read &#39;DO NOT ENTER&#39; as she stood guard with her arms stretched out but 
of course after Ayano ran out with a &#39;It&#39;s contagious&#39;. Kouda had tied a 
handkerchief around her mouth holding an antibacterial spray and waving 
it towards poor Eriko. She cried to her friend for the teasing but just 
then she felt a comforting hand on her shoulder. Turning around, she was 
met with warm eyes and a gentle smile on Yuma&#39;s beautiful face which 
caused her heart to skip a beat.

&quot;Eriko, I&#39;m not worried about getting the flu from you. I will make sure 
that you don&#39;t have it for much longer either.&quot; So she said. &#39;I mean, 
what do you respond to that! Except &#39;Yuma...&#39;&#39; thought Eriko. &quot;Why don&#39;t 
you just go home now. I will walk you back.&quot; &#39;Aren&#39;t friends great?&#39; Was 
all Eriko managed to put out in her mind as she was held by the arm with 
care walking to the staff room to get permission from the stand by 
teacher. 

&quot;Yuma, thank you for this. I don&#39;t know why the sudden caring 
but...thank you.&quot; She couldn&#39;t meet the other girl&#39;s eyes as the left 
the staff room to pick up their thongs from the class. She gave Yuma a 
quick hug since she didn&#39;t want to give Yuma the flu. Yuma on the other 
hand was sweating greatly. That was the first time they had ever hugged. 
Despite them being friends. Strange. She stuttered something that Eriko 
never understood and went on ahead to get their stuff not wanting Eriko 
to be bothered more than she was already.

........................................

By the time they reached Eriko&#39;s house, she was really tired. It seemed 
she had gotten even a little warmer now. Yuma helped her to her bedroom 
and made for the kitchen to boil some water for the hot lemon drink that 
would help the flu and also to get some Paracetamol for the pain of the 
headache. She walked out of the kitchen with the latter and a glass of 
water to Eriko&#39;s bedroom. She placed the contents on the side drawer 
when she saw her friend panting and sweating a bit. She decided that a 
cool shower should get her temperature evened out and also refresh her 
up.

&quot;I think you should take a shower before you lie down after you take 
these pills.&quot; Handing her the pills and water. After Eriko was done. 
Yuma waited for her to relax a bit, for the pills to settle in her 
stomach and stood up. &quot;Come on. I will help you.&quot; She stated helping her 
friend from her uniform all the while trying very hard not to think of 
the skin under in some way she intuitively knew would not be proper. 
When she reached the under garments, something in the back of her mind 
told her not to take them off. She took off her own uniform and stocks 
and was also left in her bra and panties only. She wondered why she was 
feeling all shy around her friend all of a sudden! &#39;I mean, I just saw 
her bear breast when she decided to feed Hana-chan in order to keep her 
quite just the other week&#39;, she thought to her self.

She was a strong girl being all a rebel and punk like had its perks. But 
she was originally strong to begin with so she carried a slightly 
bewildered Eriko who was caught by surprise and moved to the bathroom 
gently. &quot;Aren&#39;t I too heavy? I thought I was the one with the weight 
problems than you guys.&quot; She said slowly to the now smiling Yuma. She 
felt a little embarrassed and some how knew that even if she was a 
little heavier than she was now, her friend would still carry her.

&quot;Oh you are. But don&#39;t worry, just because the weigh can&#39;t hold you 
doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t.&quot; A smile. &quot;Besides, I don&#39;t see what the big deal 
is. You might be heavy but you have the best figure than all of us.&quot; She 
immediately went aflame after what she thought her friend might think 
when she thought of the last line she said. Eriko on the other hand was 
slightly amazed and a little...okay not so little glad that her friend, 
her secret love had said that about her. And here she thought Kouda was 
the sexiest and even Ayano without her glasses was no push over. But 
Yuma thought that she was the most appealing of them all. Was the fever 
gone or was it only her.

In the shower, Yuma leaned Eriko&#39;s head on her shoulder and her back 
against hers as she reached over for the soap and wash. She positioned 
them selves under the shower and started shampooing and conditioning 
Eriko&#39;s hair. After that was done, she started soaping Eriko&#39;s body and 
then rinsing out her hair followed by the rest of the body. All in the 
time she was doing this, she had decided to shut out her brain from 
sending out any other action apart from cleaning and blocked out al 
thought. It was on automatic and by the time she knew it, the washing 
was over. Reaching for the large towel that was draped over the rail 
that held the shower cover, she wrapped it around Eriko&#39;s delicate form 
and carried her back to the bedroom.

In the room, she dried Eriko&#39;s hair for her and decided to leave the 
rest of her body to herself as she would need to reach some other places 
that were covered in panties and bra. Plus she would nee to change into 
clean ones and Yuma definitely didn&#39;t wanna be round when that happened. 
Going over to the closet, she took a clean one and wrapped it around 
herself then left for the kitchen to get the lemon drink.
Eriko was left to her thoughts which she knew was a good thing. When in 
the shower, her head rested delicately on her friend&#39;s shoulder nose 
under her ear, she was treated to Yuma&#39;s scent. When she saw that her 
friend was all business like and wouldn&#39;t pay attention to her, she 
decided to inhale deeper as her nose wasn&#39;t working very good right now 
thanks to the bloody flu. She found the smell rather...enticing, 
natural. Yuma never used those fancy deodorants. Eriko wondered how she 
would smell so nice without them. She was always hyper being the punk 
and all, beating the crap out of them all when they made or said 
something unfit and embarrassing. She wanted to smell it forever. A 
startle. &#39;Now where did that come from?&#39; She wondered.

Then she remembered the first days of her junior high when she first met 
Yuma and Ayano. She wanted to be the perfect student in her junior. Just 
like she was in her earlier grades. But that never earned her any 
friends. Who always thought of her as a nerd. No one ever got even in 
the grades she was making. She was well groomed and seemed like she was 
from some rich family, which wasn&#39;t of course, but she had used this to 
her advantage. But she wasn&#39;t all brains. She also was a good 
socialiser, outside of school of course, and she had a lot of not so 
good thoughts going on in her mind that they gave birth to a new 
personality that would not come out until a certain someone decided to 
bring it out.

It was just even the first day of junior high that Yuma decided to start 
her pranks on the pretty prissy girl. Fist there was the tripping. This 
of course started everything as Darth Eriko was awakened at this moment 
retaliating with a &#39;pull back chair trick&#39;. From then on, they would 
prank each other un knowingly to them that they were getting closer. 
When Yuma struck, Eriko came back with a brainy tactic. One day, she 
went to the roof to get back at Yuma for the latest prank. She knew that 
Yuma had her lunch on the roof with her best friend Ayano but as she was 
opening the door, she over heard a very interesting conversation going 
on. Apparently Ayano was telling Yuma to apologise as it was her who 
started this whole deal but Yuma was not for her logic. Ayano mentioned 
something about Yuma teasing Eriko because she wanted her attention and 
Yuma went very red stuttering some thing as an excuse. That was all 
Eriko needed to know. 

She had confronted Yuma at her desk and the other girl went into a 
defensive position waiting for an attack but Eriko surprised her by 
smiling. She had asked Yuma if they would be friend and the other girl 
had first sat there with shock until she reached out with her hand and 
shook Eriko&#39;s mattering a &#39;sure&#39;. From then on, they had been good 
friends and they had decided to go to the same high school. She decided 
to ask Yuma about the comment later, though she didn&#39;t know why she 
needed an answer so desperately. She had heard later on, actually, two 
months ago when Ayano got a boyfriend, that Yuma made giving the reason 
why she hasn&#39;t met a boyfriend yet was because of Eriko. She had 
dismissed it also but it increased her curiosity. Did Yuma love her as 
more than just a friend or not? Which brought her back to the present 
when she heard her door creak open signalling the return of the object 
of her thoughts? She decided that she should ask Yuma about it now that 
they were alone. Which was rare these days. 

Yuma came into the room and found her friend in bed her back leaned into 
the head board awaiting her drink which she handed over carefully. &quot;How 
are you feeling?&quot; She asked her friend who replied that thanks to the 
shower, she felt refreshed and at normal temps and the medicine had 
somewhat decreased her headache. She saw Eriko steady herself as if 
bracing herself for something. &quot;What&#39;s up Eriko?&quot; She asked. Her friend 
gave her a nervous look and took a gulp of the hot lemon drink before 
composing herself for the inevitable. She looked over to Yuma and Yuma 
saw the seriousness of her friend&#39;s eyes and knew that whatever it was, 
this was serious. &quot;Yuma, Do you like me? I mean do you like me...a lot?&quot; 
She corrected herself  when she saw that Yuma was about  to ask what she 
meant. &#39;Oh My God. How did she know. I mean, I was really careful.&#39; She 
thought frantically. &#39;Oh well. Better tell her the truth. I mean, she is 
the one who asked so if she can&#39;t handle it, well...bummer.&#39;

&quot;Yes.&quot; A simple word. Yet it wasn&#39;t. At least not to Eriko. Yuma might 
as well have told her she was pregnant. She didn&#39;t think that Yuma would 
answer so honestly and that the answer would be a yes. &quot;I really like 
you Eriko. No, I have come to realize that my feelings way stronger than 
just &#39;like&#39;. I love you Eriko. I love so very much. From the moment we 
met, I was drawn to you. Even though I thought the reason was for me to 
bully you and that it was because I hated you, I found out later that It 
wasn&#39;t like that at all. We are so different yet even more alike. You 
are the brain and I am the brawl. You are clumsy and I am a top athlete. 
You are intelligent yet you know how my grades are. But we understand 
each other even more so than others. I never thought I would ever meet 
anyone who knew me better than Ayano. Or the fact that I would ever get 
along with another more than I do with her. But you proved me wrong. I 
felt really good when we used to pick on each other back in junior high. 
I had finally met my, what&#39;s the word, Ah...soul mate. I never even 
thought such a thing existed until that time. I really love you Eriko 
and I hope that we still stay friends. I mean, I&#39;m all for you returning 
my feelings but if you can&#39;t, I will deal. But you will always remain my 
first and only love. So there. That is the only question I&#39;ve ever 
answered quite well ever in my life. So...why the sudden interest?

It took a while for  Eriko to register that Yuma was done. She had never 
had Yuma say so much at once. What with her limited vocabu and what not. 
But the words left her speechless and her heart beat at the rate that 
put a baby&#39;s in the range of  the speed of sound to that of light 
(365m/s - 3x10^8m/s). Her face was hot. Hot. Hot. If she wasn&#39;t sure of 
her love of her friend she sure did now. &quot;I knew. I knew all those years 
ago in junior high. I wasn&#39;t too sure so I decided to let it go. 
Thinking that it was just a crash. But as of late, you have been 
dropping clues all over and I decided it was time. I too had some 
feelings for you back then but they were little so I copied over them. 
But they re-awakened when Ayano got a boyfriend and as I watched them 
all lovey dovey, I had a thought of getting one but just then I was 
reminded of you. I thought hard about you and I nights after that and I 
too saw the similarities and remembered that you were the one who 
brought out the real me back when we first met. 

She took another sip and smiled as she brought her face away from hey 
mug. &quot;Yuma, I too do love you. But after you told me that, My love for 
you has even increased too. She gave a concentrated smile and put her 
cup down having emptied it now. It looked like Yuma was waiting for this 
queue as she flung herself atop her friend and enveloped her in very 
warm and comfortable embrace. She let go after some time and looked up. 
They found their faces moving closer, looking forward to something they 
both didn&#39;t know how to do but knew what it was called. Eriko&#39;s heart 
sped up as if the speed at which it was going before was not enough 
already. She felt Yuma&#39;s body press into hers. Her breasts pocking at 
her upper abdomen. Sounds blocked out by the hammering of their hearts. 
Faces grew even closer, now Yuma&#39;s bust directly on hers. Breaths 
mingled together, eyes slowly closing as they both surrendered to each 
others mercy. Lips met lips for the first time in both their lives. 
Eriko passed out from the sheer sensation of the other girl&#39;s lip. After 
a few seconds, it clicked back on and by the looks of her friend and her 
un moving body, she too had passed out. As if her tongue had a mind of 
its own now, it flicked to her friend&#39;s lower lip which brought her back 
to the living and on instinct Yuma&#39;s mouth opened to allow access. But 
the poor girls being 16 already and knowing jack about these kinds of 
things, went out like a light again upon feeling each other&#39;s soft 
heavenly like insides. Once their tongues touched, that was it for them. 
&lt;&lt;&lt;Wonders how they will handle love making&gt;&gt;&gt;

They woke up several moments later in each others arms and &quot;I think we 
better stop there for now. Going out that many times isn&#39;t good for the 
body. We should take this slow&quot;. The brains told the brawl who nodded 
stupidly still amazed by what she has just felt. She placed her head on 
Eriko&#39;s chest and listened to her heart go back in rhythm. She was 
exhausted and she knew that her friend too was. She decided that they 
should sleep until their friends came to check on them after school and 
probably wake them before Eriko&#39;s parents came knocking to find them in 
each other&#39;s arms.

They were content though that, they found love and both of them went to 
sleep not expecting to have their first ever wet dreams of each other 
and screaming wondering why they would wet their beds in broad day light 
or why their pee looked white like and sticky.

OWARI.....
