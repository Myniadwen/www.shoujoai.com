<h1>Angelic Teachings</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../symphonia/index.html">Tales of Symphonia</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/endyknights.html">Endymion Knights</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Authors Notes: Hey! This is my first attempt at a Shoujo-ai fic so 
please don&#39;t be too angry. I was thinking of what pairing to do and 
originally I wanted to do a Persea/Colette, but I couldn&#39;t think of how 
to put the two togehter (I need to go back through the game again ^^;;) 
so here we have a Colette/Raine (Which after writing this seems to work 
well, to me at least.) As a warning there IS /implied/ Shouen-Ai (Or 
Yaoi incase I spelled that wrong) in the fic. Well I think that&#39;s it so 
I&#39;ll let you get started. Oh! one last thing: Please let me know what 
you think, even flames. I need warmth ^^. Thx!

Note: * indicates a thought. Also you may have seen this posted last 
year on the boards under a diffrent name. Yes it&#39;s still me I just use 
this name for my fic writing so my inbox isn&#39;t cluttred.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Colette was running through the streets of Flanoir, crying. She just 
wanted to die, there was no reason to live, Lloyd didn&#39;t love her! Her 
one reason for living had rejected her! Colette ran heading towards the 
gate, she couldn&#39;t bear to stay here any longer.

As she ran out she could see a figure in the distance, a very familiar 
one, walking as if going no where. *That looks like Raine, what is she 
doing out here?* Colette started running after her, when Raine collapsed 
in the snow. *Oh no*! Colette ran faster, calling out her teacher&#39;s 
name.

When she got to her Raine was unconscious and half frozen. Colette 
worriedly began shaking her, trying to get some type of response.

&quot;Professor! Professor please!&quot;

Raine&#39;s only response was a light groan, barely audible. *I need to get 
her warm, she&#39;s freezing!* Colette grabbed Raine by her shoulders and 
began dragging her back towards the city. *She&#39;s heavy, but I can&#39;t 
leave her here.*

---

Raine awoke to find she wasn&#39;t freezing to death as she wanted. First 
off she was in a warm bed, and second off there was a body next to her. 

&quot;C... Colette?&quot;

The sleeping chosen mumbled slightly in her sleep, as sad look on her 
face. *Did she save me?* Raine looked around the room the best she could 
without having to get up. The first thing she noted was a fire and her 
clothes hanging by it. *If my clothes are there then...*

She lightly lifted the blanket and blushed lightly upon seeing she was 
naked. *I can understand removing my clothes, but why is Colette 
sleeping next to me?* Raine felt movement next to her and looked at the 
tiny angel in time to see her awaken, Colette slowly opened her eyes and 
looked at Raine blankly for a second, the next however she had her in a 
tight hug. *At least she&#39;s still dressed*

&quot;Raine! Thank goodness you&#39;re alright!&quot;

Raine couldn&#39;t&#39;t help but feel bad, here she was trying to kill herself 
and putting the already heavily burdened Colette through more trouble.

&quot;I&#39;m alright Colette, sorry I made you worry&quot;

Colette just nodded crying slightly, Raine returned the hug a question 
forming in her mind

&quot;Colette, why were you sleeping with your arms around me?

Colette blushed slightly as she thought about what she was doing and 
what she had done. She released the hug to look at Raine apologetic.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I remember Kratos telling Lloyd to do this once to warm 
Genis. I just didn&#39;t you to die.&quot;

Colette finished looking downcast, Raine smiled lightly and ruffled her 
hair slightly

&quot;It&#39;s okay Colette, you did the right thing&quot;

Colette smiled lightly then lifted her head, only to turn away a second 
later. Raine took on a concerned look, wondering what&#39;s wrong

&quot;Is something wrong Colette?&quot;

Colette blushed lightly again

&quot;Colette?&quot;

Colette just raised a hand and pointed at Raine&#39;s chest. Raine looked 
down and realized she was sitting up uncovered, she immediately covered 
herself with the blanket.

&quot;Sorry..&quot;

&quot;Stop apologizing Colette, you did nothing wrong&quot;

&quot;but I....&quot;

&quot;Colette...&quot;

Raine just shook her head and laid back down. Colette got up and walked 
outside, leaving Raine to her thought. Why does she always feel 
everything&#39;s her fault? *This is my fault not hers*.

Colette returned a moment later with a bowl of soup, smiling as if 
nothing had happened, Raine returned it and started to sit up. *Better 
lay down, I don&#39;t want to drive her off.* 

Colette smiled and put the soup on the stand next to the bed, she then 
turned and started walking out.

&quot;Where are you going?&quot;

&quot;I was going to go outside so you could eat&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to do that&quot;

Colette blushed lightly still facing away

&quot;You&#39;re not decent&quot;

*That&#39;s what this is about?* &quot;I don&#39;t mind, we&#39;re both women&quot;

Colette just nodded slightly and sat down in a chair near the bed, she 
handed Raine her soup as she sat up. Raine just smiled lightly and took 
it.

&quot;Thank you Colette&quot;

Colette answered in  small voice, still slightly embarrassed

&quot;Your welcome&quot;

Raine just smiled lightly and began eating

---

Raine set the bowl down which Colette quickly took and set to the side, 
trying to keep herself busy and away from Raine&#39;s chest. Raine couldn&#39;t 
help but inwardly laugh. *She&#39;s so open about everything and apologetic, 
but she&#39;s so shy about this*. Raine&#39;s thoughts were broken by Colette&#39;s 
voice

&quot;What was that Colette?&quot;

&quot;N.. Nothing&quot;

Raine sighed &quot; It&#39;s okay Colette, what was it?&quot;

Colette paused, nervous &quot;Why were you running?

Raine froze, should she really unburden her troubles on her? The person 
who took the troubles of an entire world on herself? Colette noticed 
however and stood

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I should go.&quot;

*Damn it Raine! Why not just go run back outside and freeze yourself!*

Raine reached out and grabbed Collet&#39;s hand as she started to leave, 
revealing the rest of her body, which Colette caught a glimpse of as she 
turned to look at Raine

&quot;Please, if anything I should go, this is yours and Sheena&#39;s room&quot;

Colette froze at that name, the memories coming back to her of why she 
had found Raine in the first place

&quot;Colette?&quot;

Colette just stood there as she began crying softly, Raine got up and 
led her back to the bed, pulling her into a hug, ignoring her own 
nakedness

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

Colette leaned against Raine, still crying.

&quot;It&#39;s... it&#39;s nothing, I&#39;m sorry&quot;

Raine was getting annoyed by Colette&#39;s reserved attitude, here she was 
trying to help her but Colette wouldn&#39;t let her. She always felt as if 
she has to solve everything and tat it was her fault. No wonder the girl 
had so many problems

&quot;Colette, stop it. If something is bothering you, you should talk about 
it... So you don&#39;t do something stupid like me.&quot;

Colette looked up at Raine, confused

&quot;You&#39;re not stupid professor.&quot;

&quot;I am Colette, I tried to kill myself&quot; Colette looked at Raine in 
disbelief

&quot;That&#39;s why I ran outside, I was trying to die&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; Raine was finally irritated with Colette&#39;s attitude

&quot;Colette this is not fault! Nothing is your fault so stop apologizing!&quot; 
Colette froze and cried harder

&quot;Yes it is! All of this is my fault! If I had just died like I was 
supposed to then things wouldn&#39;t be this way! Everyone would be happy 
and I could still believe that Lloyd loved me!&quot; Colette froze after she 
finished, realizing what she said and that she, the supposive calm and 
gentle one was yelling.

Raine froze for a second as well, remembering her own reason for wanting 
to die. *She knows...*

&quot;Colette... I&#39;m sorry&quot; She pulled the girl into a tighter hug &quot;I didn&#39;t 
know you knew&quot; Colette however wasn&#39;t through

&quot;I hate this! He always tells me not to worry and not to sacrifice 
myself when the only reason I kept living was for him! I hate him! I 
hate Sheena! I wish she would have killed me! Raine sat there stunned. 
*Sheena? Why would she hate Sheena? Unless...*

&quot;Colette, does Lloyd love Sheena?&quot; Colette just cried harder, Raine 
turned Colette, who had been leaning against her, around and looked at 
her tearstained face, feeling her own heart break at the emotion pouring 
from the girl, she hugged her close trying to comfort her. Colette 
buried her face in her teacher&#39;s chest, not caring how awkward or 
inappropriate it seemed. *Now I feel bad... my problem is nothing 
compared to her&#39;s... but what about...?*

&quot;Colette, are you sure he loves Sheena?&quot; Colette just nodded, crying 
heavily.

&quot;He... He rejected me..... He wouldn&#39;t talk to me at all.&quot; Colette 
paused taking a few gulps of air. &quot;Then... Then Sheena went in and... 
and...&quot; Colette broke down crying, unable to continue. Raine began 
stroking her hair. *Damn it Lloyd! I would have expected this from 
Zelos, but not you!*

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Colette&quot;

&quot;I hate him... If he wants to have Sheena, then fine. I don&#39;t care&quot; 
Raine could relate to hating Lloyd at the moment, she did as well, for 
playing with Colette&#39;s heart and with Sheena&#39;s

&quot;I hate him too Colette&quot; Colette looked up at Raine, confused &quot;I hate 
him for playing with your heart and for playing with Sheena&#39;s&quot; Colette 
looked even more troubled

&quot;What do mean?&quot; Raine looked disgusted as she thought of her pupil&#39;s 
actions

&quot;The reason I was running...&quot; Raine paused to form the words, trying not 
to remember her own pain &quot;Is because I caught Lloyd and Genis... in bed&quot; 
Colette looked shocked

&quot;Raine... I..&quot; Raine put a finger to her lips 

&quot;Don&#39;t apologize, it&#39;s not your fault&quot; She looked down &quot;It&#39;s mine for 
not seeing this...&quot; 

Colette looked on as Raine started to speak again &quot;I was passing by 
Lloyd&#39;s room and I heard Genis&#39; voice, the door was cracked so I looked 
in...&quot; Raine started to cry, her own heart breaking again as she 
remembered the scene. &quot;They both... were dressing and laughing. Genis 
asked Lloyd if the could &quot;Do it again.&quot; Colette returned Raine&#39;s hug, 
herself still crying, but not nearly as bad as Raine. &quot;I... I ran I 
couldn&#39;t bear the thought that my brother was having sex... let alone 
with another man. I just... wanted to die!&quot; Raine finally broke down and 
Colette held her, forgetting her own pain for the moment. *That&#39;s why 
she was out there.* Colette looked up into Raine&#39;s sobbing face and for 
once, she decided not to be reserved. She reached up and gently kissed 
Raine&#39;s cheek, Raine sat there shocked, Colette pulled back and looked 
into Raine&#39;s eyes with a pleading look on her face.

&quot;Colette... why?&quot; Raine chose her words carefully, not wanting to 
shatter Colette&#39;s already fragile heart. Colette&#39;s response however was 
not what she expected.

&quot;Professor, please... don&#39;t die.&quot; Raine looked surprise, expecting 
Colette to do that to maybe cheer her up, but what did she mean by this 
she had to wonder.

&quot;I won&#39;t Colette, I promise&quot; Colette smiled lightly and rested her head 
against Raine&#39;s chest, still crying softly, Raine held her close and 
kissed the top of Colette&#39;s head in return. Colette now looked up at 
Raine. &quot;I won&#39;t leave you Colette, I promise.&quot; Colette just nodded 
lightly.

A little while later Colette had fallen asleep in the same position, 
Raine laid her down to sleep and tucked her in, she went to get her 
clothes then stopped. *No... If Genis and Lloyd want to do that, then 
they can. I won&#39;t stop them... * She walked back and laid next to 
Colette noticing the pained look on her face as she slept, she took her 
in her arms and watched as she curled against her, she couldn&#39;t help but 
smile lightly. *And I won&#39;t leave you... my pupil. *

A few minuets later Raine fell asleep still troubled, but feeling better 
knowing that there was someone who needed her still.
