<pre>Author&#39;s Notes:

Hey, welcome to my very first Shoujo-ai fanfic (The first I ever posted 
of course).  I especially enjoyed writing this because it is about my 
favorite game, and my favorite characters of the game, Colette and 
Sheena.  I&#39;m sure those who are reading this fanfic know about the game, 
so I won&#39;t go into character bios.  Anyways, I hope you enjoy reading 
this like I did writing it! =D

----------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The gang gazed upon the crystal clear blue water and the sandy white 
beach that laid out in front of them. 

&quot;Whoa! Check that out!&quot; said Lloyd eagerly. 

&quot;The water is so pretty!&quot; said Colette just as eagerly. 

&quot;Rarely are the beaches of Altamira as beautiful as this.&quot; said Regal 
coolly. 

&quot;C&#39;mon! C&#39;mon! Let&#39;s go in!!&quot; shouted Genis, already rushing to the 
water in his little swim trunks.  &quot;Last one in is a rotten clam!&quot; 

&quot;No fair you got a head start!&quot; shouted back Lloyd as he chased after 
Genis.  The professor shook her head as she watched Genis and Lloyd. 

&quot;Honestly,&quot; she said, &quot;you think that he just turned fifteen two days 
ag-&quot; 

&quot;Race ya there Zelos!&quot; cried Colette, already on the run toward the 
water. 

&quot;Aww, c&#39;mon!&quot; said Zelos as he tried to catch up with Colette. 

&quot;Colette not you t-&quot; Raine was interrupted by a shove to her side as she 
saw Sheena dash past her. 

&quot;C&#39;mon Raine!&quot; Sheena shouted back at Raine, &quot;age catching up to ya?&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;ll be sorry you said that!!&quot; shouted Raine as she chased after 
Sheena.  Regal and Presea stood being the only ones left.  They simply 
looked at each other, smiled, and then took off running toward the 
water. 

The sandy beaches of Altamira were soon occupied by the gang, each of 
them doing various things.  Lloyd, Sheena, Regal and Zelos were all 
playing their own version of volleyball in the water. Raine, although in 
a swimsuit, was sitting on the beach under an umbrella reading a book.  
Genis was with Presea, they both combed the beach&#39;s shore looking for 
clams with pearls in them.  Colette sat under the beach umbrella with 
the professor, observing the &#39;volleyball game&#39; from a safe distance.  
She saw Presea and Genis walking up and down the beach together, looking 
for clams and exchanging words with each other.  Colette could see Genis 
turn red as he complimented Presea on her swimsuit, Colette could not 
help but smile. 

      *Presea and Genis look so cute together.* she thought.  But 
Colette&#39;s smile quickly went away as her eyes shifted to Sheena, who was 
in the water with the other guys.  Colette sighed.  *Sheena...* she 
thought to herself.  Colette was not attracted to girls in particular, 
but for a reason that confused her, she seemed to have a huge attraction 
to Sheena.  Whenever Colette was with Sheena, she would always feel so 
safe and at ease with her.  Sometimes, Colette would also feel a sense 
of desire, a desire to be with her, in her arms.  Colette sighed again. 
*I don&#39;t know how long it&#39;s been since I met you, but you&#39;ve been like 
an older sister to me.  Always protecting me and taking care of me.  Now 
these three years have made me realize that I like you more than just a 
sister now...* Colette felt tears welling up in her eyes, she didn&#39;t 
know if they were of joy or sorrow.  *I...I think I love you...I just 
don&#39;t know why I can&#39;t tell you that...* 

&quot;Colette are you alright?&quot; asked Raine.  Colette quickly turned away 
from her and discreetly wiped the tears from her eyes.  &quot;Your crying...&quot; 

&quot;N-no professor, I&#39;m fine.&quot; Colette said semi-cheerfully as she turned 
back to the professor.  Raine closed her book and set it beside her, the 
thing Colette was worried she would do. 

&quot;Colette, is there something on your mind that you want to talk about?&quot; 
Colette turned pink and lowered her head. 

&quot;W-well...&quot; Colette felt a strange feeling as she tried to get herself 
to tell Raine about her problem.  It was almost a feeling of shame.  
&quot;I...&quot; *Maybe I should tell Raine...* she thought, *maybe she&#39;s been in 
a similar situation...what am I saying!? She&#39;ll think I&#39;m a freak if I 
tell her I like Sheena!* &quot;Eh...I was wondering if...if you could tell me 
again about the fall of the Balacruf Dynasty! Yeah, that&#39;s what&#39;s been 
bugging me!&quot;  Raine gave a stern look at Colette. *Oh no...she knows I&#39;m 
lying!!*

 
&quot;Well why didn&#39;t you just say so!?&quot; exclaimed Raine, her eyes beaming as 
if entering ruin mode** again, &quot;I&#39;d be more than happy to inform you 
about the Balacruf Dynasty!&quot;  Raine opened her book and flipped through 
some pages before resting her finger on one of them.  &quot;Aha! Here it is, 
&#39;The Fall of King Ramses Balacruf III...&#39;&quot; the professor cleared her 
throat, &quot;In the second age, Balacruf III, the last of the ancient Asgard 
lineage, led the people of the wind to...&quot; Colette continuously nodded 
and smiled.  *Wow, I&#39;m sure glad I escaped that...* she thought. 

About a couple minutes into the professor&#39;s lecture, she was interrupted 
by Zelos, who bumped into her arm and made her drop the book she read 
from.  Raine and Colette stood up. 

&quot;What the hell Zelos!?&quot; Raine screamed, &quot;We were in the middle of a very 
educational-&quot; 

&quot;Ahh! Sheena it was an accident!&quot; Cried Zelos.  Raine looked back, and 
saw Sheena coming from the water with an angry look on her face. 

&quot;Stupid Chosen!&quot; shouted Sheena as she ran full speed toward Zelos, 
&quot;Everything you do is an accident!! If you even think about touching me 
aga-whoa!!&quot; Sheena tripped over a bar of sand as she was running.  She 
stumbled and ran straight into Colette, colliding with her body. 

&quot;Ahh!&quot; cried Colette as she was falling backward.  Sheena and Colette 
landed on the ground with a thump. 

&quot;Oh Colette! I&#39;m so sorry! I-&quot; Sheena pushed herself up with her arms, 
but then she froze.  Colette&#39;s heart began to race, Sheena fell right on 
top of her.  Sheena was so close to her, her face a mere 6 inches from 
Colette&#39;s.  Colette felt Sheena&#39;s bare, slender leg in between her own 
naked legs.  Colette looked up at Sheena timidly, her face was turning 
as red as Colette&#39;s was.  Colette had always envied Sheena&#39;s beauty, 
seeing her face so close made Colette melt on the inside.  Colette&#39;s 
eyes were locked onto Sheena&#39;s.  Her deep brown eyes looked so gentle 
and welcoming.  Colette felt Sheena&#39;s warm hand pressing on her own 
hand.  She had an urge to just grab her hand, but she felt her self 
unable to move.  Colette&#39;s heart began to pump even harder as she felt 
Sheena&#39;s soft breath upon her face. 

&quot;Err...are you two alright?&quot; said Lloyd.  Sheena shook her head and 
quickly got up off the ground. 

&quot;Ahh, yeah I&#39;m fine!&quot; she said assuringly, she then looked down to 
Colette, &quot;Colette, are YOU okay?&quot; 

&quot;Y-yeah, I&#39;m fine...&quot; Colette said.  Sheena then lowered her hand to 
help Colette up off the ground.  Colette haltingly grabbed Sheena&#39;s hand 
and pulled herself up off the ground.  &quot;T-thanks...&quot; muttered Colette. 

&quot;Sheena, you gonna jump back into our game?&quot; asked Lloyd. 

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll be right there&quot; replied Sheena.  As she began to walk back 
to the game, she glanced back at Colette, who sat back down on the beach 
towel.  They both made eye contact, and blushed.  Sheena quickly turned 
her head forward and continued to walk down to the water. 
 

**Ruin Mode: When Raine finds a ruin or relic, her love for archeology 
kicks in and she enters &#39;ruin mode,&#39; a type of maniacal side of Raine 
that Genis has tried to hide for a long time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Colette had fallen asleep under the beach umbrella, she would have slept 
longer if the professor had not woken her up. 

&quot;Colette, wake up!&quot; she said, shaking Colette.  She slowly got up, 
rubbing her eyes and squinting in the sunset.  She looked over at Raine, 
she was fully dressed and reading her book. 

&quot;Oh! How long was I asleep!?&quot; asked Colette.  The professor gave a small 
chuckle. 

&quot;You were asleep for almost two hours...&quot; Raine laughed.  Colette looked 
around her, the volleyball game was over, and no one was to be found. 

&quot;Where is everybody? How come no one woke me up?&quot; asked Colette 
frantically. 

&quot;They are getting ready to go back to the inn.  The day didn&#39;t last as 
long as they had hoped for I guess.&quot; 

&quot;Oh...&quot; said Colette as she got up off the ground and on her feet. 

&quot;Nobody really wanted to bother you; you sure looked peaceful while you 
slept.&quot; 

&quot;Eheheh...&quot; Colette laughed half-heartedly, &quot;Umm...professor, why are 
you still here?&quot; 

&quot;I stayed behind to wait for you to wake up, unless you wanted to wake 
up with no one around.&quot; The professor got up onto her feet and brushed 
the sand from her clothes, &quot;Now that your up, do you want to head back 
now?&quot; 

&quot;Oh, yes of course...&quot; she said, slightly embarrassed. 

&quot;Well there&#39;s a changing booth near here, go ahead and change out of 
your swimsuit and I&#39;ll see you back at the inn.&quot;  Colette nodded and the 
professor departed.  Colette picked up her tote bag containing her 
clothes and began to walk over to the changing booth on the other end of 
the beach. 

Colette could not stop thinking about her &#39;encounter&#39; with Sheena 
earlier.  *Sheena&#39;s body was so close to me...* thought Colette as she 
turned a bright pink, *...I didn&#39;t know her body was so soft...* her 
heart began to pound, *I...I want to tell her...but...I don&#39;t know how 
she&#39;ll react...* Colette sighed. &quot;I guess I just need to find the 
courage to say it...&quot; She said out loud.  Colette, finally reaching the 
changing booth, threw the tote bag off her shoulder and opened the 
door... 

&quot;Ahh! C-Colette!?&quot; cried Sheena from inside the changing booth.  A rush 
of heat filled Colette&#39;s flustered face. 

&quot;S-Sheena!! Sorry! I-I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; she said frantically as she quickly 
turned away and closed the door.  Colette sat down right outside the 
changing booth, her face still flustered and hot.  The image of Sheena 
in the changing booth was burned into her mind.  Sheena was completely 
naked, her moderately tan, smooth skin completely exposed; her breasts 
were even bigger than they looked in her swimsuit.  In the booth, 
Sheena&#39;s black hair was not held up; it hung straight down, a little 
past her neck.  Colette had never seen Sheena with her hair down, it was 
very cute.  A couple minutes past and Sheena came out of the booth in 
her yayoi** and with her hair up again.  Colette quickly got up off the 
ground. 

&quot;Sh-Sheena! I&#39;m sorry!&quot; said Colette bowing to Sheena, &quot;I-I should have 
knocked and, and...&quot;  Sheena began to laugh at Colette&#39;s frantic 
stuttering. 

&quot;Hehe, it&#39;s okay Colette, you just startled me, that&#39;s all.&quot; She said 
reassuringly.  &quot;I thought you were Lloyd or Zelos or something.&quot;  Sheena 
and Colette laughed.  &quot;Well you can go ahead and use the changing booth 
now, I&#39;m all done.&quot; 

&quot;Okay, th-thanks.&quot; replied Colette, avoiding eye contact with Sheena.  
Everytime she looked at her, her face got hot again. 
 

**Yayoi: A female ninja&#39;s robe, this refers to Sheena&#39;s main costume in 
the game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Colette couldn&#39;t sleep later that night.  She laid in her bed and closed 
her eyes, but sleep did not come to her easily.  Colette couldn&#39;t stop 
thinking about Sheena.  The encounters they had earlier that day filled 
her mind.  Colette sighed.  *Sheena...I love you more than anything...* 
she thought, *Do you feel the same way about me...?* Tears began to roll 
down Colette&#39;s face, and flow onto her pillow.  She wiped away the tears 
from her eyes, then sat up in her bed.  Colette could no longer bear it, 
she needed Sheena to know her feelings about her.  Colette quickly, but 
quietly got out of bed, being careful not to wake Raine, who shared 
rooms with her.  Colette crept over to the door, and carefully closed 
it.  Sheena&#39;s room was just three doors down the hallway.  Colette 
gathered all the remaining courage she had, then marched down to 
Sheena&#39;s room. 

Colette knocked on the door to Sheena&#39;s room, in just several seconds, 
Sheena opened the door. 

&quot;Oh, hey Colette.&quot; said Sheena, &quot;What&#39;re you doing up?&quot; 

&quot;I...I couldn&#39;t really sleep.&quot; replied Colette shyly. 

&quot;Really? I couldn&#39;t either.&quot; 

&quot;Umm, if it&#39;s not any trouble, do you want to come walk with me?&quot;  
Colette asked, turning a slight red as she asked.  She noticed that 
Sheena turned a little pink as well. 

&quot;Umm, sure!&quot; she replied, &quot;Where to?&quot; 

&quot;How about the beach? The moon is out now and the ocean looks really 
pretty.&quot; 

&quot;Okay, sounds good.&quot; Colette and Sheena then walked down the hall and 
took the elevator down to the first floor, then went outside to the 
ocean. 

The two didn&#39;t talk much as they walked down to the beach.  Sheena 
complimented Colette on her cute outfit, which made Colette blush.  
Since Colette was no longer the chosen of mana for Sylverant, she didn&#39;t 
need to be restricted to wearing the angelic clothing she always wore.  
This night, she wore a small white tanktop with a knee-high brown skirt.  
Although Colette is not used to wearing clothes that revealed her body, 
she became very comfortable with them.  Colette also shyly mentioned 
that when she saw Sheena in the changing booth, she noticed that her 
hair was down when she was changing.  Sheena blushed on the subject, but 
thanked Colette when she said that she looked cute with her hair down.  
Sheena took out the small purple bow that held her hair up out, and her 
ash-colored hair collapsed down to her neck.  Colette smiled at Sheena, 
but Sheena blushed again. 

Colette and Sheena finally reached the ocean.  They picked a good spot 
on the beach, and sat down.  Colette looked up at the moon. 

&quot;Wow! the moon is big tonight!&quot; she said in awe. 

&quot;Yeah it is, the ocean looks so pretty tonight probably because of it.&quot;  
Both Colette and Sheena looked down at the ocean.  The moon&#39;s reflection 
was present in the water.  The ocean was like a mirror, the light of the 
moon just seemed to bounce off of it and light up the ocean.  Colette 
looked at Sheena as she stared at the ocean.  Sheena&#39;s calm face lit up 
in the luminous light, it made Colette blush.  Sheena then turned to 
Colette, Colette quickly looked away from her face.  Colette, 
remembering why she called Sheena out here, turned back to Sheena. 

&quot;Um...Sh-Sheena...?&quot; she stuttered. 

&quot;Hmm?&quot; said Sheena. Colette felt her heart race again.  She felt as if 
she could panic at any given moment.  Colette swallowed hard and took a 
deep breath and clenched her eyes... 

&quot;Sh-Sheena.  Although we didn&#39;t start out as good friends when we first 
met, I am really glad to have met you!&quot; Colette paused, but recollected 
herself, not opening her eyes, afraid of Sheena&#39;s reaction.  &quot;Ever 
since, you&#39;ve always looked after and protected me, even though I was 
suppose to be your enemy.  These past three years you&#39;ve been with us 
has made me realize th-that I...I...&quot;  Colette felt herself fall apart, 
she just couldn&#39;t say those last three words.  &quot;I...I...&quot; Colette 
stuttered again as she tried her hardest to get those words out, but 
could not find the strength to do it.  When she tried, her throat 
constricted, and her lungs seemed to cave in.  Suddenly Colette felt a 
driving force within herself explode out of her.  She opened her eyes 
and looked at Sheena.  &quot;Sh-Sheena! I love you!!&quot; she said loudly. 

Colette gasped, then covered her mouth and clenched her eyes again.  *Oh 
no! I-I said it...* she thought, still clenching her eyes. Colette 
looked down to the ground and opened her eyes, not wanting to look at 
Sheena.  Her vision blurred as tears filled her eyes and fell onto her 
lap.  Colette looked up at Sheena slowly, and was surprised...Sheena was 
crying.  &quot;Sheena...your...&quot; Colette was interrupted by Sheena as she 
sprang forward and embraced Colette in a tight, warm hug.  Colette could 
hear Sheena breaking down as she cried on her shoulder. 

&quot;Colette...*sniff*...you don&#39;t *sniff* know how happy I am...&quot; sobbed 
Sheena into Colette&#39;s shoulder.  Colette could feel Sheena&#39;s warm tears 
on her shoulder and running down her arm.  &quot;I...I *sniff* I don&#39;t know 
why I never told you before...but meeting you has been the greatest 
honor of my life.&quot; Sheena sniffled and lifted her head from Colette&#39;s 
shoulder, but she bowed her head, not making eye contact with Colette. 
&quot;You are the most caring, forgiving person in the world Colette...when 
you and the others found me badly wounded at Luin, you were the one who 
wanted to help me, despite the fact that I was the one sent to kill 
you...&quot;  Sheena slowly looked up at Colette, her eyes still filled with 
tears.  &quot;I...guess you said it first...but I don&#39;t care anymore, I just 
want to be heard.&quot;  A teardrop rolled down Sheena&#39;s face and dropped 
onto Colette&#39;s hand. &quot;I...I love you too Colette!&quot; Sheena broke down 
again and cried into Colette&#39;s shoulder.  Colette was speechless and 
overwhelmed with happiness.  She could feel even more tears coming from 
her eyes, tears of pure happiness. 

&quot;...Oh Sheena!&quot; she cried as she tightly wrapped her arms around Sheena 
and cried into her shoulder.  The two of them cried with each other in 
their arms for what seemed like several minutes.  Sheena finally pulled 
back from the hug so she could look into Colette&#39;s moonlit face.  
Colette&#39;s face was flustered, and was looking down at the ground 

&quot;Colette...&quot; Whispered Sheena, running a finger down Colette&#39;s cheek.  
Colette slowly looked up into Sheena&#39;s gentle eyes still filled with 
tears.  She removed her arms from around Sheena&#39;s waist, and wrapped 
them around her neck.  Colette closed her eyes and pressed her lips 
against Sheena&#39;s.  Colette ran her hand through Sheena&#39;s silky hair as 
she kissed her.  Sheena wrapped her legs around Colette and pulled her 
body closer to her as they kissed, Sheena&#39;s breasts pressing against 
Colette&#39;s. 

&quot;Ngh...&quot; said Colette softly through her nose.  The feeling of Sheena&#39;s 
breasts pressing on hers sent a small wave of ecstasy from her breasts 
to throughout her body.  Colette felt Sheena&#39;s tongue enter her mouth.  
She opened her mouth wider and let Sheena&#39;s tongue explore her mouth.  
Finding Colette&#39;s tongue, Sheena massaged it with her own tongue, 
caressing and deeply feeling it.  Colette felt herself get hot again, 
she had never been kissed like this before, it felt great.  Sheena 
finally released from her deep kiss.  Colette and Sheena stared at each 
other again, both of them a shade of pink. 

&quot;Heh...it was my first time too...&quot; Sheena said softly, in an almost 
embarrassed way.  Colette backed off slightly to move her legs, so that 
they were entwined with Sheena&#39;s.  The two looked at each other again 
for a moment, then embraced each other in another warm hug. 

*I want to stay like this forever...* thought Colette as she held Sheena 
in her arms, *Please...don&#39;t ever leave me Sheena...*  Colette could 
feel tears coming from her eyes again.  *I always want to be with 
you...to the very end...* Colette broke down in tears and cried into 
Sheena&#39;s shoulder.  Sheena held Colette&#39;s head, stroking her long blonde 
hair as she comforted her.  Sheena could feel tears coming from her own 
eyes. 

*I love you Colette...&quot; thought Sheena as a tear drop rolled down her 
face, *I&#39;ll protect you...I won&#39;t let anyone hurt you...ever...* </pre>
