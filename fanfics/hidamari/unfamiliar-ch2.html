<h1>Familiar Unfamiliarity (part 2 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hidamari/index.html">Hidamari Sketch</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/loveisgod.html">Love-is-god</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../hidamari/unfamiliar-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;Sll-fslup!&quot;  Miyako slurped up her noodles as Yuno watched on in a sort 
of reluctant fascination, taking small, measured bites of the banbanji 
that she had ordered.  She felt that the dish of chilled vegetables and 
chicken was perfectly cool and light for the ongoing summer weather, but 
Miyako had chosen a more substantial yakisoba dish for herself. They sat 
in the open air section of a small diner not too far from where they 
lived, and Yuno was happy to note that their prices were,  on the whole, 
quite reasonable.  Even if they hadn&#39;t been, though, Yuno didn&#39;t  mind 
footing her friend&#39;s bill once in a while, the obvious pleasure and zeal 
with which the starved blonde attacked her dish were enough for Yuno.  
It wasn&#39;t in any way that she felt sorry for Miyako because of her 
financial woes, you somehow couldn&#39;t feel sorry for somebody who didn&#39;t 
feel sorry for themselves, and Miyako&#39;s usual countenance was about as 
far from &quot;sorry&quot; as it was possible to get.  

Miyako glanced up while trying to free a few stubborn noodles from the 
discussions they were having with their fellows in the bottom of the 
bowl, and noticed Yuno looking rather comical, mouth half-open and 
chopsticks half-moved to it, eyes on her.  Miyako smiled inside, and 
with one last heroic slurp freed the noodles for their final journey.  
She turned her slurping pucker into a kiss and blew it over to Yuno.  
Yuno blinked.

&quot;Did you want some?&quot;  Miyako invited, &quot;I knew that a growing girl 
wouldn&#39;t be able to settle for just a little salad-thing.&quot;  She finished 
knowledgeably, picking up a small amount and twirling the noodles 
carefully on her chopsticks, before reaching over to Yuno.  Yuno had 
been about to say that that wasn&#39;t it, but she didn&#39;t quite know what 
was it, so that would have been a difficult explanation to finish.  So 
instead she took the offered yakisoba.

&quot;I think it&#39;s pretty good,&quot; Miyako said, retracting her hand, &quot;How about 
you?&quot;  Yuno chewed and had to admit it was really tasty, there was a 
moderately talented cook in the back.  She looked back to Miyako to tell 
her the same, but stopped, watching as her friend continued eating, 
bringing the chopsticks up to her lips and... Yuno blushed, memories of 
countless uses of that clich&eacute; in the shoujo manga she read coming to 
her.  The indirect kiss.  Miyako looked curiously at her.

&quot;You don&#39;t think it&#39;s spicy, do you?&#39;  

Yuno answered with a nervous little laugh and shook her head, not about 
to tell Miyako what went through her mind.  Unfortunately for her, 
Miyako chose that moment to display her occasional uncanny knack for 
accidentally stumbling right to the heart of a matter.  With a wicked 
little smile she closed the chopsticks together and brought her lips to 
them in an exaggerated kiss.

&quot;Indirect kiss!&quot;  She crowed, &quot;I guess Yuno&#39;s pretty cute, so I don&#39;t 
mind at all.&quot;  Miyako smiled her most cheerfully unapologetic smile, 
causing Yuno to blush deeper.  Miyako usually didn&#39;t actually mean the 
things she said to tease her friends, and everybody knew this, but 
somehow they remained just as effective in embarrassing them.  

&quot;Miya-chan!&quot;  Was all that managed to emerge from her flaming face, and 
she bent down to continue eating her own meal accompanied by Miyako&#39;s 
peal of laughter.  

&quot;So what do you think could be going on with Sae-san and Hiro-san?&quot;  
Miyako started with no warning.  Yuno looked back up quickly, and saw 
that Miyako had cleaned her plate first, with all the attention Yuno had 
not been giving to her own.  To think for a moment longer, she took a 
bite and chewed slowly.

&quot;I don&#39;t know.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen either of them really upset 
before... and I can&#39;t think of anything that would make them that way.&quot;

&quot;I think it was mostly Hiro-san that was mad, Sae just looked troubled 
by her.  You think Sae-san hurt her feelings somehow by accident?&quot; 
Miyako was at her rarest now, not even a hit of a smile decorating her 
mouth, &quot;Doesn&#39;t seem like something she would do though...&quot; Miyako 
finished quietly, lip twisted in thought.

&quot;Sae-san did tell us not to worry, though.  Maybe I&#39;m just thinking 
about it too much.&quot;  Yuno sighed and leaned back in her chair, appetite 
lost and plate sitting ignored and half-full in front of her.  

&quot;Friends are there to worry about their friends.&quot;  Miya answered firmly, 
though there hadn&#39;t been a question, &quot;Hey, Yuno-chi, that banbanji was 
pretty good too, if we come here again I might get this instead.&quot;  It 
was a good thing Yuno had lost her appetite, she wouldn&#39;t have had much 
left to fulfill it, not with a hungry Miyako still at the table with an 
unguarded plate.

Yuno shook her head ruefully and pushed back from the table.  They paid 
their bill and went back to the apartments, Yuno&#39;s apprehension growing 
all the way.  She didn&#39;t want to just ignore her two other friends, but 
neither did she relish the opportunity to speak with them if they were 
still as out of sorts as earlier.  As they rounded the street corner and 
came into view, they noticed an unexpected visitor rapping on Hiro&#39;s 
door.  

&quot;What&#39;s the landlady doing here?&quot;  Yuno wondered aloud.  They veered 
over.

&quot;Yo.&quot;  She greeted them with an inclination of her head, cigarette 
dangling from one side of her mouth.

&quot;Good afternoon, Landlady.&quot;
&quot;Hey, Landlady.&quot;

Then the door opened and Hiro stepped out.  Her eyes appeared red around 
the rims, and her face was slightly drawn and tired-looking, but she 
worked up a smile that was a good deal more natural and genuine than she 
had tried to put on for Yuno and Miyako earlier.  When here eyes caught 
the pair standing past the landlady, she flashed them an apology with 
her eyes, then turned back to Landlady.

&quot;Hello.  What can I do for you today?&quot;  She asked politely.  

&quot;Can I come in?&quot;  Came the casual querying reply.  Landlady pulled on 
her cigarette and blew a stream of smoke into the air.  Then she flicked 
it on the ground, grinding it beneath one heel.  Hiro looked relieved 
that the smoke wouldn&#39;t be following her into the room, and nodded, 
opening the door wide.

&quot;Come right in.  You&#39;re welcome, too, Yuno-san, Miya-chan.&quot;  Hiro 
invited them.

&quot;Sorry it&#39;s not too homey right now, but I&#39;ve been doing some packing.&quot;  
Hiro smiled apologetically, and all three guests looked around 
astonished, though Landlady to a lesser degree, at the sealed boxes 
stacked against the walls.

&quot;So you were serious when you said you wouldn&#39;t be staying here this 
year.&quot;  Landlady observed.  Yuno and Miyako gasped, and whipped around 
to Hiro, who was biting her lip.

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m afraid I won&#39;t be able to stay.  Yuno, Miya-chan, I&#39;m not 
going to school this year either.&quot;  They echoed their own gasps.

&quot;Hiro-san!&quot;  They both began explosively, but the landlady cleared her 
throat loudly and all three turned their attention over to her.

&quot;Just so you know, there&#39;s no hurry to be out soon, take your time.&quot;

&quot;But Landlady, don&#39;t my things have to be out before the start of the 
month, that&#39;s tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, if you haven&#39;t paid your rent.  But you&#39;ve got your first and 
last months rent, and security deposit, covered.&quot;

&quot;What!  How?&quot;

&quot;I got a call an hour ago from Sae,&quot;  She jerked her head to the wall 
adjoining Sae&#39;s apartment, &quot;She took care of it.  She asked me to let 
you know for some reason.  I didn&#39;t want to, but she really didn&#39;t want 
to have to tell you.  I just came down to see what&#39;s up.&quot;  She crossed 
her arms and looked at Hiro expectantly.  Hiro, though, didn&#39;t seem to 
notice the penetrating stare she was receiving, her eyes were flashing 
and she looked furious.

&quot;No.&quot;  She said stonily.

&quot;No what?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m not accepting this.  You take back that money, and I&#39;ll be out 
of here before tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, no can do, Hiro-san.  You&#39;re here, and you&#39;re paid up for this 
month and the last month.  You&#39;d be breaking your lease with me, you&#39;d 
have to pay a penalty, and your friend wouldn&#39;t get her seventy-five 
hundred yen back.  Could you deal with either of those?&quot;  Hiro went 
stark white, and shook her head mutely.

&quot;Mind telling me why the girl who paid your rent had to make me let you 
know about it?&quot;  Hiro flushed, eyes darting over to Yuno and Miyako, who 
had been silent in the background for most of that exchange, and even 
more confused than they had been at the start.  Landlady followed her 
gaze, and rolled her eyes.

&quot;Can&#39;t talk with these two in the room, is that it?  Beats me as to why, 
I got the feeling you four were really close.  Fine then.&quot;  She turned 
to face the two with a look that told them, more effectively than any 
vocal directive could have, that they should probably excuse themselves 
now.  They stood outside, Yuno fretting and Miyako trying to think of 
how to make her stop fretting.  

&quot;Miya-chan, what&#39;s going on?  Hiro looked so angry, and she said wasn&#39;t 
going to live here, and Landlady said Sae-san paid her rent, and without 
her knowing?  Why is all this happening and why is everybody so angry 
and sad?  I just wanted us to all be together and have fun again!&quot;  
Miyako was a little alarmed at Yuno&#39;s sudden rush of words, and the 
tears that sparkled in the corner of her eyes.

&quot;Oh Miya-chan!&quot;  Yuno cried in a half-sob, and threw herself into her 
friend.  Miyako stood stiff for a moment, then awkwardly put her arms 
around Yuno&#39;s shoulders in a tight hug.  She didn&#39;t say anything, no 
&quot;there there&quot;s or anything of that nature.  Yuno didn&#39;t really cry so 
much as she just let herself be embraced, burying her cheek against 
Miyako&#39;s chest and letting out a long sound of discontent.  This wasn&#39;t 
how her first day back at Hidamari was 
supposed to be... 

Yuno didn&#39;t look to be going anywhere anytime soon, so Miyako gave her a 
reassuring squeeze and laid her head down on her friend&#39;s.  Yuno quieted 
soon, but she didn&#39;t move, and Miyako didn&#39;t at all mind the warm body 
pressed against her, or the soft hair under her cheek.  Yuno felt peeved 
with herself for having fallen apart like that, she hadn&#39;t realized how 
much she took for granted their two older friends being so implacably... 
themselves.  Always together; kind and soft-spoken Hiro-san, with her 
abundant generosity and patience, then cool and confident Sae-san, 
insightful and always ready with some little gem of wisdom to pass to 
her younger companions.  To have those two at odds with one another was 
somehow unbearable.    At least Miya-chan was still Miya-chan.  Yuno 
kept her arms around Miyako, feeling warm and protected from the letdown 
reality had put her idealistic expectations through.  She suddenly was 
struck by everything she was taking in with her every breath.  She could 
smell the faint, slightly harsh scent of what was, knowing Miyako, a 
laundry detergent on the cheaper side of the spectrum, offset only 
slightly by the sweetly fragrant overlay of a fabric softener.  She was 
close enough to catch the scent of a lock of Miyako&#39;s hair, flowery and 
sweet.  And there was something else, a little under and a little over 
and a little in between everything was... it was like the smell of 
bright sunlight, and a brisk wind, and stream of sparkling clear water.  
If those things had a smell, it would be what Yuno breathed in from 
Miyako.  It even seemed to have something of her friend&#39;s blithe, 
natural enthusiasm for life in it, because Yuno caught herself feeling 
very content, and even happy, standing here with her friend.  With an 
odd reluctance, though, she made herself pull away, becoming conscious 
of the fact that they couldn&#39;t stand here outside like that in front of 
Hiro&#39;s door all day.

Miyako loosened her arms slowly, and nuzzled her cheek against Yuno&#39;s 
hair one last time before they parted, not knowing why she felt so much 
like she needed to.  Yuno looked up at her, and Miyako noticed some 
moisture sitting in the corners and bottoms of her eyes.  Somehow 
knowing just what to do, she placed her hands to the sides of Yuno&#39;s 
face and wiped it away with her thumbs.  They held one another&#39;s eyes 
for a few moments longer, then the odd spell was broken.  

&quot;Er, sorry, Miya-chan.  I&#39;m okay now.  I&#39;m just worried about...&quot;

&quot;I know, Yuno-chi.&quot;  Miya replied, softly smiling, &quot;So, I know just what 
we need to do then.&quot;  Miyako said, tapping one thumbnail against her 
lips.

&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;I think we have some questions that need to be answered, and Sae-san 
probably knows what&#39;s up.  Isn&#39;t that right, Chocoyama-kun?&quot;  Yuno 
smiled brightly, though a little sadly.  It was usually Sae who played 
the part of fashionable detective Lovely Chocolate.  She recognized 
though that Miyako was, once again, trying to cheer her up, so gave the 
requisite response.

&quot;You&#39;re right, Miss Chocolat!  We need to go see Sae-san right away and 
ask her a few questions.&quot;  Behind their little play, however, Yuno could 
feel in some part their shared determination to get to the bottom of 
this.  It wasn&#39;t entirely fair for their friends to go about acting the 
way they were without giving an explanation.  The walked across one door 
and knocked.  After a minute, they heard curiously slow footfalls 
approaching, and Sae&#39;s irritable face filled the gap between the wall 
and door.

&quot;Ah, Miss Sae-san, is it?&quot;  Miyako started, affecting a light cough, 
&quot;Would it be okay if we troubled you for just a few minutes.  We won&#39;t 
be long, we just have a few questions we need you to answer.&quot;  Sae 
looked hard at Miyako for a few seconds, then sighed and turned to Yuno.

&quot;I give up, what&#39;s with her?  Is she mad at me now too?&quot;

&quot;No, Sae-san, she&#39;s just in character.&quot;  Yuno explained a little 
vaguely,  Could we come in and talk to you for a little bit.&quot;

&quot;Eh, sure, why not.  I can&#39;t promise I&#39;ll be any more talkative than 
earlier, though.&quot;  She opened the door for them and they walked inside.  
Miyako&#39;s eyes seemed to be working overtime, darting to every nook and 
cranny they could find, and she often stopped them with no particular 
focus for a loud &quot;Hmm... I see.&quot;  Sae looked at her with raised eyebrow 
on every such occasion, one could really only find so many interesting 
things to say, &quot;Hmm... I see.&quot; at in the four or five meters between the 
door and the main room, and she was pretty sure Miyako had passed that 
limit.  Yuno just smiled, and this seemed to calm Sae&#39;s nerves a little.  
Yuno and Miyako sat down at the low square table in the center of the 
room, while Sae took her seat once more at her desk chair, this time 
sitting in it backwards to face the middle of the room and look at her 
friends.

&quot;So what&#39;s up with you two?&quot;

Miyako cleared her throat loudly, &quot;So, Miss Sae-san... if I may ask, 
where were you and what were you doing on the afternoon of...!&quot;  She 
paused, and turned to Yuno, &quot;What&#39;s today&#39;s date again, Yuno-chi?&quot;  She 
whispered out of the corner of her mouth.  Yuno shook her head.

&quot;Miya-chan... I&#39;ll just ask her.  Sae-san, we were just coming back to 
the apartments and met the landlady outside of Hiro-san&#39;s apartment.  We 
all went inside, and Hiro-san looked like she was packing to leave.  
Landlady told her that she didn&#39;t have to go because you had paid for 
her, and Hiro-san looked really mad, and Landlady said something about 
you asking her to tell Hiro-san so you didn&#39;t have to.  We were about to 
hear why, but Hiro-san didn&#39;t want to say in front of us.  So... 
Sae-san, please, tell us, what&#39;s going on?&quot;  Sae was wide-eyed, then 
laughed a little ruefully.

&quot;Looks like you don&#39;t need detective skills like Lovely Chocolat with 
Miyako&#39;s blind luck.  So own you two know all of that... and you found 
out mostly by accident.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s any reason we shouldn&#39;t know, Sae-san.  
We&#39;re all friends, and it makes me sad that you don&#39;t think you can talk 
to us about what&#39;s troubling you.&quot; 

&quot;Well, it&#39;s kind of a big deal, Yuno, and a little private.  Even 
friends are entitled to a little bit of privacy.  But... I guess I can 
tell you some of it.  Hiro wasn&#39;t going to be able to go to school or be 
here this year, because her family wasn&#39;t going to be able to pa-- no, 
wasn&#39;t going to pay for her rent and tuition this year.  She had a fight 
with her family and that&#39;s what they decided to do.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s awful!&quot;  Yuno yelped, and Miyako nodded a fervent agreement.

&quot;Yeah, they had no right... there was no good reason...&quot;  Sae compressed 
her lips into a thin, pale line, and Yuno didn&#39;t think she&#39;d ever seen 
her friend this angry before, &quot;But I don&#39;t think I should be telling you 
about that.  The point is, they weren&#39;t going to pay.  Now, this whole 
thing is kinda... sort of my fault too, in a way, so I thought I would 
surprise her.  I went ahead and paid for her rent, and the first half of 
her tuition--&quot;

&quot;Sae-san!  How could you ask your family to pay that much more!&quot;  Yuno 
interrupted again, but Sae just looked perplexed, then started laughing.

&quot;Who said anything about my family, Yuno-san?  But that&#39;s besides the 
point, let me go ahead and finish this for now.  I paid that for her, 
and then I invited her over to talk about it.  I kind of asked her, &#39;How 
would you feel if I said I was able to pay your way this year?&#39; but she 
reacted very badly.  She was furious with me, even though she thought it 
was just an idea of mine.  I think it&#39;s just because she felt like she 
would be taking advantage, but it&#39;s not like I can think of anything I&#39;d 
rather do with that money than make sure she can be with m--&quot;  Sae 
blushed a deep red, &quot;That is, I think she&#39;s being foolish about the 
whole thing.  She got so upset that I didn&#39;t dare tell her that I had 
already gone through with it, so after you all left I called Landlady to 
let her know for me.  It took quite a bit of asking, but I think she 
likes me.  I still haven&#39;t found a good way to tell her about her 
tuition...&quot;

&quot;So that&#39;s why she was so upset...&quot;  Yuno mused, then Miyako spoke up, 
all traces of the fashionable detective gone.

&quot;But where did you get the money to pay for all that, Sae-san?&quot;

&quot;Oh, right.  Well, you two know that I write novels...&quot;  She flushed a 
little more, and pushed her glasses up the bridge of her nose, &quot;I had a 
little savings stored up from all my sales, about six-hundred thousand 
yen.&quot;  She paused to hear the two gasps and observe the two awed 
expressions, &quot;Hey, that did take me the better part of three years to 
save up, and I haven&#39;t been touching it.  But the thing is, it looks 
like... well, my latest volume was really popular, I guess- don&#39;t know 
why, I didn&#39;t think it was so great- and that jumped up to about one 
million, eight-hundred thousand yen during the last few months.&quot;  She 
paused again to regard dropped jaws, &quot;That&#39;s still not quite enough to 
cover all of Hiro-san&#39;s rent and tuition, not to mention living 
expenses, but they&#39;ll keep selling, right?  It&#39;s enough for until next 
semester, anyway.&quot;  There was a pregnant pause.

&quot;Hey, I was able to say all of that with a pretty straight face, do you 
think you could put your jaws back in place now?&quot;  Sae said peevishly, 
blushing again.  

&quot;Wow, Sae-san, I had no idea you were that popular!  I guess some people 
have tastes like that...&quot;  Miyako mused, eliciting an outraged yelp from 
Sae.

&quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot;

&quot;She didn&#39;t mean anything!&quot;  Yuno hastily reassured her, &quot;It&#39;s just a 
little bit of a shock.  We had no idea you were making so much off of 
your work!&quot;

&quot;Well... I mean, it&#39;s not that much, it did take me four years to make 
it all.  I wouldn&#39;t have been able to live off of my writing at all.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I guess... but that clears a few things up.  Now we know why you 
were so sad and Hiro was so upset--&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think she&#39;s thinking completely clearly, either, Yuno.  The 
fight with her parents hurt her more than she&#39;s admitting, I think.&quot;  
Sae interrupted her, &quot;I hope that if I give her some time, she won&#39;t 
mind so much and we&#39;ll be able to talk about it.&quot;  Sae appeared 
thoughtful, &quot;It&#39;s already done, you know.  She might be able to get most 
of the tuition back for me, but I would refuse to take it back, and the 
lease already stops her there.  It&#39;s not very nice, I know, but she 
doesn&#39;t need to give up her life just because her mom and dad....&quot;  Sae 
trailed off, and they saw that angry tightening around her eyes again.  

&quot;I&#39;m sure she will, Sae-san.&quot;  Yuno said brightly, &quot;That was really nice 
of you to do for her, I can still hardly believe you didn&#39;t spend all 
that money on anything else!&quot;  Sae looked embarrassed at Yuno&#39;s praise.  
Then they all heard a loud banging on the door.  Before Sae could call 
out to the person, however, the door opened and she let herself in.  
Locks of her bubblegum pink hair had gone astray from her ties, and her 
eyes flashed venomously.  She stalked into the room, and Sae drew back 
almost unconsciously from her.

&quot;You!&quot;  Hiro yelled, pointing one accusatory finger to the dismayed girl 
leaning into her desk.  She strode quickly forward, &quot;You...&quot;
