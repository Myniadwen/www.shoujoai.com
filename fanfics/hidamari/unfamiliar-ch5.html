<h1>Familiar Unfamiliarity (part 5 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hidamari/index.html">Hidamari Sketch</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/loveisgod.html">Love-is-god</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../hidamari/unfamiliar-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Miyako flipped shut her sketchbook with a sharp snap, sighing.  She was 
laying stretched out on the bare wooden floor of her room, where she had 
been drawing for the past few hours.  Everybody else was asleep by now, 
but she just didn&#39;t feel tired.  She remembered this time last year, all 
she was was tired, out with an awful cold.  Even though she was an 
idiot, she thought fondly.  

Sighing, she sat up cross-legged, hugging the book to her.  She rocked a 
few moments, for no reason other than to be moving, then lay her 
sketchbook down across her knees.  She reached up and took out her 
ponytail tie, shaking her head and allowing her hair to fall loose.  
Miyako grabbed a hair brush from a paint brush jar on her long, 
cluttered table and started working through the day&#39;s tangles in long, 
slow strokes.  Her eyes caught the pencils she&#39;d left laying on the 
floor, and she picked them up now before she forgot and lost them or 
stepped on them.  Setting the brush to the side, she picked up her 
pencil case and put her number one and two pencil in, but kept the 
number three out.  This one was Yuno&#39;s.  Miyako felt a little silly for 
having borrowed a pencil for just some casual sketching to pass the 
time, but for some reason she&#39;d felt a strong compulsion to give it a 
little more effort than she might have other casual projects like that.  
The varying shades and reflectiveness&#39;s of different pencils added a 
dimension to her drawings that she couldn&#39;t get with just one, and she 
was happy with how the drawings had turned out.  She twirled the number 
three in her fingers, and around her hand.  Being as energetic as she 
was, she&#39;d become fairly good at pen and pencil twirling over the years.  
She set it on the bridge of her nose, and looked up, trying to keep it 
balanced.  When she grew bored with that, she tossed it into the air and 
caught it, again and again until she missed and it clattered to the 
floor, rolling away.  

After she&#39;d gotten up and retrieved the pencil, she just set it on her 
table and left it alone.  Still feeling wide-awake, she stripped down to 
her underwear and pulled on a short pair of shorts and a loose t-shirt, 
her equivalent of pajamas.  She turned out the light and lay down in her 
bed, staring at the ceiling.   This was one year, then, since she&#39;d met 
the girl who&#39;d become her best friend.  She smiled at the memory.  She 
was always one to try and make accurate, if not good, first impressions, 
and her first words with Yuno had been to ask her if she had any soba 
noodles for her new neighbor.  However it had worked out, they had 
become fast friends almost instantly, without even noticing.  On sudden 
Impulse, Miyako stood up and walked to her sink, turning the knob.  
Water splashed out, swirling down the drain.  Of course, that was 
exactly what should happen, she had paid her water bill this year.  
Sometimes it seemed life in the city was just a constant process of 
spending, but she made it through some way or another.  It probably 
didn&#39;t hurt that Sae and Hiro helped her with remembering those kinds of 
things, though Yuno was so nice that she didn&#39;t even seem to consider 
the possibility that Miyako might need to be told those sorts of obvious 
things.  

Yuno was just like that.  Miyako knew that most people wrote her off 
fairly quickly as a ditz, or immature, or childish.  She also knew they 
were entirely correct when they supposed that she was ditzy, immature, 
or childish, but writing her off as nothing but those wasn&#39;t right at 
all.  That was probably one of the nicest things about having friends 
like hers.  Sae and Hiro and Yuno, they could all look past her more 
eccentric behaviors.... no, that wasn&#39;t it.  They could look at her 
eccentric behaviors, and see the rather eccentric girl behind them, and 
loved her anyway.  

Miyako considered, and concluded that she had probably regressed a bit 
after she had moved here.  Maturity-wise, that is.  There was something 
about being accepted like that by her friends, and something about being 
in this art school- one that also managed to look upon her foibles and 
see creativity- that had let her fly more freely than her stuffy primary 
school had.  Especially around Yuno.  Hiro would calmly accept her 
behavior most of the time, and Sae would even get occasionally 
irritated.  Yuno gave her most of her motivation.  Miyako felt no reason 
to restrict her imagination or actions around Yuno.  It was probably 
because of her cute little smile.  How could Miyako even consider 
limiting a part of herself that made Yuno smile like that?  Only one 
thing could make her turn away from trying to make Yuno smile, and that 
was the occasional incident wherein it became more practical to make her 
friend blush, also quite cute.  Yuno was good at that cute thing.

That worked out quite nicely, because Miyako appeared to be good at the 
making her smile and blush thing.  Of course, neither were all that 
difficult.  Miyako was fairly certain that her knowledge of the... facts 
of life was no more extensive than Yuno&#39;s, but Yuno&#39;s naivety came into 
play when she got so embarrassed about having those referred to, while 
Miyako remained very comfortable with the entire idea.  After all, 
everybody wanted somebody, or at least some body, at some time, and 
Miyako didn&#39;t see anything embarrassing about that.  At least not in 
theory.  

Despite all her work, though, she&#39;d never been able to get the kind of 
blush out of Yuno that she&#39;d seen today, during Sae and Hiro&#39;s little... 
display.  That was just the sort of thing Miyako meant, how Yuno would 
be embarrassed there, but Miyako had just felt... well, she wasn&#39;t sure 
exactly what she had felt.  A little surprised, for sure, that her two 
friends had had that kind of relationship and had kept it secret for so 
long.  Then she felt happy for them,  of course, they were her friends.  
But underneath that was something else... she wasn&#39;t sure what it was.  
It was linked to a little ache, only ache wasn&#39;t the right word, more a 
little emptiness that lay somewhere in the bottom of her chest.  A 
little feeling, really, that she usually wasn&#39;t aware of, just 
sometimes.  On nights like this, she would lay awake and alone with only 
her thoughts for company, and feel that sense of restlessness that told 
her that there was something that she should be doing or something she 
needed, and not doing or getting whatever it was left her feeling 
aimless, unfulfilled.  She was a little consoled by the knowledge that 
this sort of thing faded by morning like clockwork, though she wished 
she knew what it was that she was not quite getting.  She sighed again, 
then blinked and realized that she&#39;d been standing there with the water 
running for a few minutes while lost in thought.  She turned it off with 
a peculiar pang.  She remembered last year when she had forgotten to pay 
her water bill, Yuno had allowed her to use her bath.  Well, Miyako.  
Looks like that wouldn&#39;t be happening this year, which was almost a 
shame, that had been a fun early memory to make.  

Miyako yawned, and stopped in the middle of it, surprised.  Somehow 
fatigue had caught up with her as she slowed down to muse, she 
gratefully realized.  They were going back to school tomorrow... well, 
today now, she&#39;d stayed up until the earliest hours of Monday morning, 
but the point was that, with tired finally coming into the picture, she 
wouldn&#39;t be losing all her sleep.  That would have be an awful way to 
start school; she&#39;d had a few problems staying awake in class anyway.  
Laying down, she was slightly perturbed when her mind drifted once again 
towards that little spot of absence in her chest.  It always seemed to 
call attention to itself in times like now, she thought, when she 
stopped thinking about anything else.  She suddenly wondered if Yuno 
ever felt like this, maybe she would know what to do...

She drifted off easily in the middle of her thoughts, sprawled out on 
the top of her bed.

X-x-X-x-X-x-X-x-X

Tok-tok-tok

&quot;Miya-chan?  Miya-chan, are you up yet?&quot;

-Yes, she was almost up, Miyako thought irritably, she&#39;d been climbing 
this mountain for a few weeks now, battling hunger and the elements.  In 
fact, she would have fallen off four times already, if she hadn&#39;t been 
able to fly.  What did they think she&#39;d been doing, that she wouldn&#39;t be 
almost to the top yet?-

&quot;Hey, Miyako, it&#39;s time to go!&quot;

-Time to go?  What was she talking about?  They&#39;d already left the bank 
with the loot, now they needed to get away from the cops.  If only that 
blasted cloud would stop trying to eat them, they&#39;d be out of reach of 
the police and their terrifying trained attack sofas.-

&quot;We&#39;re coming in, Miya-chan.&quot;

-No!  Don&#39;t come in, you&#39;ll be sucked into the time warp and forced to 
eat robot fingers for the rest of your life!  There must be some way to 
undo the spilled soda... ah, but now there was an earthquake!-

&quot;Yo, Miyako, up and atom!&quot;  Sae yelled as she shook the dead asleep 
Miyako&#39;s shoulder, in what amounted to a futile attempt to wake her.  
She stopped, and looked helplessly to Hiro and Yuno.

-The earthquake had finally settled.  Her heart was pounding, and it was 
pitch black.  She&#39;d fallen safely inside of a tepee, however, and rescue 
would probably be on the way, she&#39;d listen carefully for the elephants 
trumpeting.  For now, however, she needed to find some provisions... ah, 
what was this?-

&quot;Why&#39;s she chewing on her pillow?&quot;  Hiro wondered aloud.  Yuno shrugged, 
then decided to give a shot at waking their sleeping friend.  She sat on 
the edge of the bed and grabbed Miyako&#39;s shoulders, giving her a little 
shake, then leaning over and loudly talking into her ear, &quot;Miya-chan, 
you need to wake up, it&#39;s time for school!&quot;

-What&#39;s this?  There was somebody else trapped with her.  Miyako sighed, 
the poor soul shouldn&#39;t have taken the taxi.  But the girl, Miyako 
thought she should know her name, grabbed her by the shoulders and 
started talking to her.  She couldn&#39;t understand what she was saying, 
but thought the girl was probably scared, so she did the best thing she 
knew of for that situation, and gave her a big hug-

&quot;Gyah!  Miya-chan!&quot;  Yuno yelped as Miyako suddenly reached up and 
pulled her down, hugging her like a teddy bear around her shoulders.  
Miyako was fairly athletic, and her grip was sound, so all Yuno could do 
was kick her feet against the mattress as she was held in place next to 
her friend, cheek to cheek.  To her chagrin, Sae and Hiro started 
snickering.

-The girl seemed less afraid, but still agitated.  The unseen figure in 
the dark raised her face and nuzzled their cheeks together.  Miyako 
breathed in sharply, suddenly becoming more aware of the body she felt 
against her own.  She wasn&#39;t sure what she was feeling, but suddenly it 
seemed only too natural to lean over, and...-

&quot;M-Miya-chan?&quot;  Yuno stopped struggling and inquired nervously as the 
blonde&#39;s breathing changed from the deep, heavy rhythm of sleep to 
something quicker, shallower.  Yuno twisted her neck to see Miyako&#39;s 
face, which she found easily, so close to her own.  Also close to her, 
she found just as easily, were Miyako&#39;s lips, in fact they were so close 
that... Yuno realized with a start that she was experiencing her first 
kiss.  Sae and Hiro looked on, at first too surprised to move.

&quot;Mi--&quot;  Yuno, after a moment&#39;s hesitation started to object, but 
Miyako&#39;s mouth opened slightly and swallowed her protests.  Yuno felt 
something lightly tickling her closed lips, and wondered dazedly what it 
was, for some reason suddenly thinking that it would be a good idea to 
open her lips.  Before she could do so, she felt another pair of hands 
on her, pulling her away.  She felt suddenly irritated, she was about to 
find out what that soft touch on her lips was, couldn&#39;t they have waited 
for a second?  Sae grabbed her shoulders and pulled while Hiro forced 
Miyako&#39;s arms open.  The whole process yanked Miyako into a sitting 
position, where she sat, eyes coming half-open.

&quot;Miyako, have you no shame?&quot;  Sae shouted at her.

&quot;Eh, wha?&quot;  Miyako answered sleepily.  Sae roughly took Miyako and shook 
her a bit.

&quot;Wake up, damn it, stop dreaming!&quot;

Yuno watched all of this with detached interest, her fingertips resting 
lightly on her lips, a light flush high in her cheeks.

&quot;Yuno?  Yuno-san?&quot;  Hiro asked her, and Yuno slowly looked over.

&quot;Hmmm?&quot;  Yuno managed dreamily, and Hiro frowned.

&quot;Sae, I think she&#39;s in shock!&quot;  

&quot;Who, Miyako?&quot;  Sae asked, watching as Miyako finally seemed to be 
becoming aware of her surroundings, blinking and appearing alert, though 
confused by all of the input she was receiving just after waking up.

&quot;Hey everybody, what&#39;s going on?  What&#39;s wrong with Yuno-chi?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with her?  You are!&quot;  Miyako frowned, giving this serious 
consideration, then brightened with a look of discovery.

&quot;Oh!  I think I was having naughty dream.&quot;  Miyako said casually, 
confirming either that she was still sleepy enough to not think about 
what she was saying, or that she really did have a deficiency of shame, 
&quot;Did I sing something weird that shocked her?&quot;

&quot;Sing something, sing something?&quot;  Sae said incredulously, &quot;No, you...&quot;

X-x-X-x-X-x-X-x-X 

Miyako stepped out of her room to meet the three girls who had been 
waiting outside while she changed.  Sae was tapping her foot 
impatiently, Hiro had a calming hand laid upon her arm, and Yuno 
appeared to be off in her own world.  They all turned to see Miyako, 
still smoothing out her skirt and sleeves.  She made brief eye contact 
with Yuno, and they both looked away.  As it turned out, Miyako had some 
small amount of shame, or at least the ability to feel abashed.  

&quot;G&#39;morning, everybody, thanks for getting me up.&quot;  Miyako said with a 
nervous little smile.  Sae rolled her eyes, Hiro giggled slightly, and 
Yuno even looked her way and smiled reassuringly.  With that, the 
tension went out of the foursome and all was forgiven.  

&quot;Let&#39;s make like General MacArthur, troops!&quot;  Miyako stated firmly, then 
jutted her chin forward in a frown and marched forward, arms swinging 
exaggeratedly. 

&quot;What are you doing, Miya-chan?&quot;  Yuno inquired.

&quot;I shall return!&quot;  Was Miyako&#39;s only answer as she continued her odd 
strut.  Looking confused, Yuno followed, and Hiro explained that part of 
the story of the American general and the Philippines as they walked to 
the school across the street.

By odd coincidence they met the first-year art teacher, Miss Yoshinoya, 
just inside the doors.  That they met her in the school wasn&#39;t so much 
unusual, but what was had to do with her choice of dress for today: the 
uniform of a four-star general, including sunglasses and riding crop.  
Miyako stopped and dropped her act in favor of a long stare at this 
newest costume from their teacher.

&quot;Hi, everybody.  It&#39;s so good to see all of your faces again.&quot;  
Yoshinoya greeted them warmly.

&quot;What&#39;s with that outfit today, Yoshi?&quot;  Sae asked her, once again 
displaying that unusual, unexplained familiarity she had with her old 
teacher.  

&quot;Oh, this?&quot;  Yoshinoya said, pretending to be taken aback by the 
question, &quot;Well...  to be honest, I&#39;m going to be teaching a couple of 
second-year art classes this year.  I hear that second-years are 
absolute monsters, I was hoping I could look a little intimidating.&quot;  

&quot;Um... but Miss Yoshinoya, we&#39;re second years.&quot;  Yuno said, tilting her 
head towards Miyako.

&quot;Why, so you are!  Please, don&#39;t be too harsh with me, I&#39;ve never taught 
students like you before.&quot;

&quot;But we were just in your class last year.&quot;

&quot;Well that was last year, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;  Yoshinoya said cheerfully.

&quot;But, why are you teaching second-year classes this year, anyway?&quot;  Hiro 
asked politely.

&quot;One of the art instructors resigned, and the only qualified replacement 
found only had first-year experience too.  I don&#39;t know why, but the 
Principal told me that he and I would split first and second years 
between us...&quot;

&quot;Even though he scolds you a lot, he must see that you&#39;re a really good, 
nice teacher.&quot;  Yuno encouraged her.

&quot;Thank you for saying so, Yuno-san.&quot;  Yoshinoya smiled sweetly, &quot;I think 
I&#39;ll be glad to have you in class for another year.&quot;

&quot;You mean that I&#39;m in your class?&quot;  

&quot;Mm-hmm, and Miyako-san too.  I don&#39;t have any new second-years, I was 
given all groups that I had last year.&quot;

&quot;Wow, that should make things easier for you.&quot;

&quot;I think so too.  I&#39;ll already know half my students, instead of having 
to teach everybody new when I only did year one classes.&quot;

&quot;So why are you so worried about them?&quot;

&quot;Worried?  I am?&quot;  

&quot;The outfit...?&quot;

&quot;Oh, this.&quot;  She looked down at herself, &quot;Oh my, yes, I&#39;m still worried.  
Of course.  See you all later.&quot;  She walked quickly away.  Watching her 
go, Sae sighed and frowned.

&quot;Why couldn&#39;t she just admit that she wanted to dress up?&quot;

&quot;Miya-chan, we&#39;re going to have Miss Yoshinoya again!&quot;  Yuno said 
happily, taking Miyako&#39;s hand excitedly.  Miyako turned a big smile to 
her as well.

&quot;Phew!  I was afraid I would get some stuffy mothball teacher that would 
try to silence the great Miyako-Picasso!&quot;  They both seemed to realize 
simultaneously that this was as close a contact as they&#39;d had since this 
morning, and both thought that they didn&#39;t really mind, but also both 
thought that the other might, and that they should probably let go.  So 
they both did, breaking eye contact and blushing lightly.  All might 
have been forgiven, but things might be awkward for a day or so... or at 
least each hoped it would only be that long.  

Miyako thought the whole thing was highly unfair.  Of all the times her 
dreaming could have turned weird, it had to be when Yuno was there, and 
that close?  She didn&#39;t remember what had happened in reality, but she 
remembered her dream well enough, and what Sae had told her seemed to 
match up pretty well.  But really, should it matter that much?  
Everybody thought it was a little odd that she could sing in her sleep, 
but they got over that, could they just overlook the fact that she could 
sleep-kiss too?  Seemed perfectly reasonable to her.
