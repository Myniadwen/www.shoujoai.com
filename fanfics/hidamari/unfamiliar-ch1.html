<h1>Familiar Unfamiliarity (part 1 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hidamari/index.html">Hidamari Sketch</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/loveisgod.html">Love-is-god</a><br> </h2>
<pre>There was just something there.  It was in the compartment she rode in.  
It was in the people there, those friendly and unfriendly, young and 
old, tall and short, thick and thin.  It was the in green of the grass, 
the blue of the sky, the blur of the grass rushing by and the sedate 
pace of the far-off clouds.  It could be heard in the sound of the air 
rushing by, and the vibration of the tracks under her feet.  It was in 
everything seen reflected in a pair of large, shining brown eyes.  It 
was sameness.  A sameness that most would consider routine, expected, 
dull, unmentionable, but it filled her heart with contentment.  Which is 
why, when the train finally approached its destination, she was able to 
hop from her seat, take up her small, two-wheeled luggage carrier, and 
go down the aisle with a bouncing step and infectious smile that many 
found themselves sharing, despite the &quot;blah&quot; that they may have felt 
about this day amidst the others.  She looked out on the city with the 
nostalgic air of one returned home after time untold away.  Though 
traditional sense would tell her that she call the place she had left a 
few hours before &quot;home&quot;, the road she walked on now felt more a 
homecoming than when she had followed it the other way.  Could this be a 
part of growing up?  She asked herself, feeling giddy at the thought of 
that ever-elusive maturity that plagued the thoughts of adolescents the 
world over, but also managing a light pang of nostalgia, almost 
unnoticeable even to her, which was the only thing that really confirmed 
that maturity.  Not too terribly confirmed, however as she started, in 
the middle of the flowing commuters, to laugh at her thought.  She 
couldn&#39;t be too mature yet, how many adults found time to indulge in 
laughing at themselves?
	
She continued with a bright smile and shining eyes, now finally taking 
sights which were different and new.  New didn&#39;t trouble her, though, as 
she supposed that would always be the way life worked.  No matter how 
similar things might seem after time passed, and how ever much she might 
want them to stay the same, changes would always come.  She would still 
privately hope that change had decided to pass over three particular 
little parts of her life, however.  She stood at the edge of the street 
in front of the train station, waiting for the light to change to cross.

&quot;Yuno-chi!&quot;

Yuno froze and looked behind her, just as the lights did change. She 
might have stood stock still, and held her breath in disbelieving 
excitement, but instead she was jarred and forced to yelp a quick 
apology as several people following closely behind ran full into her, 
jarring her belongings. She checked over it to make sure the collision 
hadn&#39;t knocked anything loose, and raised her eyes just in time to catch 
the most wonderful bit of sameness she&#39;d seen today. A blond mop of 
hair, haphazardly tied back in a loose ponytail, bobbed up and down 
around the shoulder level of the majority of the throng exiting the 
train station. Yuno could hardly stand in one place without receiving 
some amount of ire from the crowd, given the space she and her things 
took, so turning the awkward thing around to go meet her friend was 
strictly out of the question. She was forced to sit impatiently through 
those short seconds as her friend approached. Then she was there, burst 
through the wall of people and skidding on her heels to a teetering halt 
before she too, crashed into Yuno.. For a long moment the girls just 
stood and looked at one another. Yuno thought, amused, that Miyako 
looked as though she could really use that moment&#39;s rest. Several 
strands of sun-bleached golden strands had worked loose and hung lazily 
across shining amber eyes and a wide grin.  Her chest rose and fell with 
her lightly puffing breath.  She looked for all the world like she was 
on a brisk hike, with her only apparent possessions the clothes she wore 
and a single backpack.

&quot;So it was you,&quot; Miyako started, &quot;I wasn&#39;t sure, I couldn&#39;t see you that 
well because everybody else around is taller and all, but I started 
running as soon as I thought I had maybe seen you. Isn&#39;t that kind of 
funny? Maybe I have some kind of powers, x-ray vision to see through 
people. But...I don&#39;t think I saw through anybody, so maybe I have 
psychic powers?  I suppose I could have those and not really know about 
them.  But you know what that means, Yuno-chi, we can never play 
hide-and-seek, I&#39;ll always be able to find you!&quot; Yuno giggled at her 
breathless declaration, very glad to see that Miyako was as happy and 
excited to see her as she was to see Miyako again.

&quot;Miya-chan.&quot; She laughed, not knowing how else to answer the statement, 
but then she put on a serious countenance, &quot;Oh, psychic powers? Then why 
don&#39;t you tell me what I&#39;m thinking about right now?&quot; Miyako looked 
deeply into her eyes and a look of intense concentration grew on her 
features. Yuno felt an odd, lightheaded sensation, coupled with a spread 
of warmth through her chest. Could I be having my mind read? The thought 
skimmed through her mind in one brief burst of illogic, but Miyako 
answered the unspoken question herself with her following words.

&quot;Yep, I&#39;m reading... that you&#39;re really happy to see me, and... that you 
want so much to buy me lunch.&quot; She accentuated the statement with a 
certain mystical flair that was altogether ruined by an impudent wink.

&quot;One out of two isn&#39;t bad, Miya-chan, but I don&#39;t think you can read 
minds. Sorry.&quot;  Yuno smiled, but her high spirits crashed down as her 
friend suddenly appeared crestfallen. 

&quot;Oh, Miya-chan, I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to ruin your fu--&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s okay Yuno-chi. I&#39;ll be happy enough with a free lunch for now, 
but I sure wish I knew why you weren&#39;t happy to see me...&quot;

&quot;Miya-chan!&quot; She protested, but Miyako&#39;s bright smile made everything 
alright again, and they both started off laughing. A few quiet minutes 
passed. They&#39;d had plenty of time for talking and such over the summer, 
they had kept in contact, and were happy now to just soak up the 
physical presence which they had really missed most. 

They stopped at another light.  Looking over, Yuno was forced to admit 
that while Miyako had been the best bit of familiarity she had seen 
today, she was also a remarkable specimen of change. Yuno was by now 
used to being the shortest of her circle of friends- her friend had just 
casually mentioned it being hard to see her in a crowd- but it looked 
like Miyako had shot up five or six centimeters over the summer. Also, 
while she still had that same active, toned body, it looked as though it 
had stopped strongly suggesting feminine curves, and finally got to 
making them part of the scheme. Not too much, but just enough to make 
Yuno look between them, and down over her own self and fret a little 
about her own womanly progress.

&quot;I think Yuno-chi look plenty cute and shouldn&#39;t worry about anything.&quot;

Yuno blushed. 

&quot;I thought I noticed you noticing, and I didn&#39;t even need any powers.&quot;  
Miyako observed her with a careful eye, &quot;I don&#39;t think poking at them 
will change them much, though, and you look a little silly walking 
around pushing them together like that.&quot;

&quot;Miiiyaaa-chan!&quot; 

&quot;Oooh-ooh! Especially if she can blush like that whenever she want to, 
Yuno-chi will get any boy she wants!&quot; Miyako continued to dig into her 
shy friend with an irrepressible grin.  The light signaled to walk.

&quot;You could always try like Sae-san and pray at the Buddha statue. It 
didn&#39;t do her any good, but maybe it needs more to work with. Oh yeah, 
do you think she and Hiro-san will be getting here soon? I&#39;m sure it 
wouldn&#39;t take too much to convince Hiro to fix up a nice reunion meal.&quot; 
Yuno was grateful for Miyako&#39;s excitement now, happy to be on another 
subject.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure, they might already be there.&quot; She answered, realizing now 
that she hadn&#39;t heard from either of her other friends in the past few 
days, &quot;I&#39;ll call Hiro-san and see.&quot;  She fished her phone out of her 
pocket.  The line rang a few times, then stopped and went to voice mail.  
Though feeling it might be impolite, Yuno tried once more, but this time 
it didn&#39;t even bother with the ringing.

&quot;I can&#39;t reach her right now. 

&quot;Hmm... but they were there before us last year, right?&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm.&quot;

&quot;Then there&#39;s still a chance for my stomach!  Hang in there, old 
friend.&quot;  Miyako rubbed her stomach with a sympathetic expression.

&quot;Miya-chan, have you eaten today?&quot;

&quot;I had a sandwich on the train.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll get you something if Hiro-san isn&#39;t there, you know.&quot;

&quot;Oh, of course I know that, Yuno-chi.  I&#39;m psychic, remember?  Now come 
on, step up, no time to be dawdling now.&quot;  Miyako quickened, and Yuno 
had to work to keep up with Miyako&#39;s now even longer-legged pace.

&quot;Wait for me!&quot;



The apartments looked just as they had left them.  It hadn&#39;t been more 
than two months, so this wasn&#39;t really very surprising.  Yuno looked 
with dismay towards the staircase, however, there was no way she was 
going to be able to carry all her things up there without taking several 
trips.  While she stood there unwilling to start the process, however, 
Miyako took the situation in at a glance and picked up two suitcases.  
Yuno watched as she went into an exaggerated military knee-high march in 
place and ran up the stairs.

&quot;Hup-too three-four!  Let&#39;s go, Yuno-chi!&quot;  It took Yuno a moment to 
shake off her grateful surprise, thinking she should have known she 
could count on Miyako, and pick up another box.  Between them, they only 
had to take that trip and one more for the last package and the carrier, 
a lot less than the four or five Yuno had been thinking of by herself.

&quot;Phew... thanks, Miya-chan.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome.  Now we can go see everybody, I&#39;m starved.&quot;  Yuno put a 
hand to her forehead, you couldn&#39;t expect Miyako to let her thoughts 
stray too much when she was hungry.  They stopped so Miyako could unlock 
her door and unceremoniously sling her backpack inside.

&quot;You sure didn&#39;t bring much.&quot;  Yuno observed.

&quot;Most of my stuff from last year is still in there.&quot;  She explained 
brightly, &quot;I only took a sketchbook and some pencils when I left.&quot;

Yuno had packed up everything for her sojourn back to her parent&#39;s 
house, bedding and toiletries and knick-knacks, as well as all of her 
school things.  It wasn&#39;t that she thought she would need all of it, 
but... she couldn&#39;t leave her bath salts or rubber duck behind, and she 
really liked her shampoo, and that was the most comfortable blanket she 
had taken when she moved to the Hidamari apartments in the first place, 
and a lot of her cutest clothes too, and--  Yuno shook her head.  She 
kind of envied her friend&#39;s carefree run through life, but didn&#39;t think 
she would ever be able to emulate it.

They went over to room 102, but a few loud raps on the bright yellow 
door and a few minutes of waiting told them nobody was home.  
Undeterred, they went across one to Sae&#39;s apartment, but just as  Miyako 
was about to knock, the door opened and they were faced with a stranger 
that looked quite a bit like Hiro.  Only, this person was absent the 
steady, warm smile and eyes brimming with kindness of their friend, and 
had the edge of one thumbnail clamped firmly between her teeth.  It took 
the pair at the door a few seconds to wrap their minds around the fact 
that this had to be Hiro, despite what told them it wasn&#39;t, and less 
than a second for Yuno to process this information and reach out for her 
hand.

&quot;Hiro-san, what&#39;s the matter?&quot;  Hiro, also taking a few seconds to 
process that two friends had suddenly appeared in front of her when she 
was on her way elsewhere, managed to affix a ghost of her usual 
expression on before answering.

&quot;Nothing, Yuno-san.  Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;  Yuno looked, in her na&iuml;ve 
trusting way, supremely unconvinced.  

&quot;Are you upset because you gained a few kilos?&quot;  Miyako grinned, poking 
at Hiro&#39;s perfectly flat belly.  Hiro&#39;s eyes flashed in a way that was 
certainly unlike her, and she smacked Miyako&#39;s hand away.

&quot;No, ! I said don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;  Then she looked apologetic, 
&quot;Sorry.&quot;  Miyako was surprised, and a little hurt.  A little friendly 
teasing had never really angered anybody among their circle as much as 
embarrassed, especially Hiro.  She didn&#39;t say what she was sorry for, 
but Yuno and Miyako understood.

&quot;Yuno, Miyako?  Is that you?  You can come in if you like.&quot;  Yuno and 
Miyako looked at one another, thinking that this looked to be a less 
pleasant time than originally thought.  But Hiro looked at them as well, 
and with a casually inviting turn of her head beckoned them to follow 
her back inside.  The apartment was dark, and they found Sae sitting in 
her desk chair, stretched back to look at the ceiling, toe extended 
tilting her back, and a pencil clenched in the side of her mouth.  They 
might have thought that she was in the middle of composing a manuscript 
for her manga project, but her desk was bare.  The only thing she looked 
was preoccupied, but she smiled lightly when she saw the two enter, 
though her eyes showed even more worry when she let them fall on Hiro, 
who wouldn&#39;t meet her eyes.  Yuno and Miyako felt quite uncomfortable 
being in the same room with these two, and the latter couldn&#39;t even 
bring herself to inquire about snacks.  

&quot;I thought I&#39;d see them in,&quot;  Hiro said, still refusing to look at Sae, 
&quot;But I&#39;m still going now.&quot;  She turned and walked back to the door with 
a measured pace, though whether to avoid appearing reluctant or relieved 
Yuno couldn&#39;t tell.

&quot;Hiro, come on, don&#39;t go yet.&quot;  Sae turned her head to plead with the 
other girl, but though Hiro hesitated for a moment, she didn&#39;t stop, and 
nobody could see what was on her face.  The door closed with a soft 
click, and Sae exhaled explosively and let her chair fall back hard on 
all fours, muttering something under her breath that sounded somewhat 
like a string of strong curses, though Yuno didn&#39;t want to assume.  As 
through only just remembering that the other two were still here, she 
turned her head sharply to them with a wan smile.

&quot;Sorry about that, me and Hiro are just having a little disagreement, 
don&#39;t you concern yourself with anything.  So how have you two been, it 
must have been a week or more since we spoke?&quot;  They could tell by her 
affected nonchalance that Sae didn&#39;t want to talk about what had just 
happened.

&quot;I&#39;m good, Sae-san.&quot;
&quot;O-kaaay!&quot;

Sae smiled, &quot;Should have guessed, you two probably don&#39;t have much to 
worry about.&quot;  Her mouth twisted with just an edge of bitterness, but 
then she shook her head, angry at herself, &quot;Ah, don&#39;t pay attention to 
me.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot;  Yuno consoled, but then she fixed Sae with a certain 
sympathetic, concerned, caring, and just a little sad expression that 
only she could really have managed, and only then because she wasn&#39;t 
aware of its effectiveness. Yuno searched for the most tactful way to 
ask what was going on, while Sae softened under her gaze.  

&quot;Yo, what&#39;s up with you and Hiro-san?  I was just assaulted a moment 
ago, what&#39;d you say to her?&quot;  Miyako continued for her, though she 
hadn&#39;t quite put as much thought into tactfulness.

&quot;Assaulted?&quot;  Sae said sharply, raising her eyebrow.
 
&quot;Yeah, how can a poor little girl like me stand against a ferocious 
fighter like Hiro-san?&quot;  Miyako made a cowering motion, crouching down a 
bit, and Sae snorted.  Mostly because Hiro wouldn&#39;t do such a thing, and 
also because even with Miyako cowering down a bit, she could still have 
looked Hiro at eye level.

&quot;She just got made at Miya-chan poking her tummy and slapped her hand 
away.&quot;  Yuno explained, &quot;But that&#39;s still so unlike Hiro-san.  I mean, 
not the slap, but how angry she looked.&quot;

&quot;Look you two, don&#39;t worry about it.  Hiro is having some problems, and 
I&#39;ll be able to help her with them, as soon as she lets me anyway.  
Friends don&#39;t always get along, you know, things will be fine before you 
know it.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure we can&#39;t do anything, Sae-san?&quot;  Yuno asked earnestly.

&quot;I&#39;m sure, Yuno.  Everything will be back to how it was soon... I hope 
very soon.  I sure do miss... never mind.&quot;  Sae had started to turn red 
as she always did when embarrassed, and Yuno wondered why.

&quot;Uh-oh!  Are there boys involved?&quot;  Miyako butted in.  Yuno expected Sae 
to get angry, whether it was true or not, but after looking startled- as 
tended to happen with Miyako around-   she started chuckling, still a 
little red.

&quot;No, definitely no boys involved, Miyako.  I can promise you that.  Now 
really, you two don&#39;t need to concern yourselves with this.  Now don&#39;t 
you two have some unpacking to do or something?  I don&#39;t mean to run you 
off, but...&quot;

&quot;We understand, Sae-san.&quot;  Yuno said kindly.  &quot;We&#39;ll go now.&quot;  She 
grabbed Miyako&#39;s hand and led her out as well, to make sure the 
sometimes insightful, but more often less-than, blonde followed.  They 
shut the door, leaving Sae alone in the dark with her thoughts.  They 
looked to Hiro&#39;s door and, neither of them saying anything, walked the 
other way.  They were both troubled by this conflicted reunion with 
their old friends, the news that Hiro was having financial problems, and 
to a degree even by Sae&#39;s revealed riches.  Miyako, however, was not one 
to dwell uselessly on matters she could not change at the moment.

&quot;Hey, Yuno-chi, I guess you&#39;re buying lunch?&quot;  Yuno blinked, and might 
have thought something along the lines of Miyako not caring about her 
friends, but one look at her face told otherwise.  Miyako could be 
spontaneous, sometimes dim, and always a little spastic, so it was easy 
to underestimate her.  Yuno knew Miyako well enough to see her own 
worries echoed in Miyako&#39;s face, and also enough to see that her friend 
was trying to cheer her up.  So she put on a brave face and a small 
smile, nodding and walking back towards town.
