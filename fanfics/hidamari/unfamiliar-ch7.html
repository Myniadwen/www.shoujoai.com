<h1>Familiar Unfamiliarity (part 7 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hidamari/index.html">Hidamari Sketch</a>

<a href="../hidamari/unfamiliar-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>The rest of the school day passed much more pleasantly for Yuno and 
Miyako, their teacher&#39;s words staying fresh in their mind.  Yuno stopped 
worrying about her world becoming a little more mixed up, and Miyako 
stopped worrying about Yuno worrying, and without either of them 
worrying about things that didn&#39;t need to be worried about, they had a 
worry-free first day back at school, at least right up until they walked 
out.  

&quot;Ooooh, that&#39;s something you&#39;re not supposed see in the summer.&quot;  Yuno 
groaned at the gray, overcast sky.  It had been clear the last time 
she&#39;d seen outside, but at some point afterward a low cloud bank had 
come to blanket as far as the eye could see.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Yuno-chi, it&#39;s probably just a silly summer shower that 
will be gone in an hour.&quot;  

&quot;Hey you two, wait up!&quot;  Their two older friends followed them out of 
the building and joined them.

&quot;Sae-san, Hiro-san, how did your first day go?&quot;  Yuno asked the beaming 
pair.  

&quot;Fantastic!&quot;  Sae started, &quot;All of my classes are great.  I&#39;m only 
taking the academic classes that I need to graduate, so it doesn&#39;t look 
like those are going to be really hard, but my writing and art courses 
are perfect.  They&#39;re serious and challenging, but the teachers actually 
manage to treat you like you know what you&#39;re doing.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m doing well too, Yuno-san.&quot;  Hiro added afterwards, &quot;I&#39;ve finally 
stopped thinking about it, and decided to take a culinary arts class 
this year.  I&#39;m looking forward to trying some new things in my kitchen, 
I hope you&#39;ll help me decide if I&#39;m doing it right.&quot;

&quot;For the sake of Hiro-san&#39;s sake, I will go miles out of my way to aid 
her in this endeavor.&quot;  Miyako pledged her future assistance.  

&quot;How about you two?&quot;  Sae asked.

&quot;It feels a lot like last year, actually.&quot;  Yuno grinned, &quot;Especially 
with Yoshinoya teaching us again.  Math is still math and history is 
still history, but I still have high hopes for this year being even 
better.&quot;

&quot;So, did Miss Yoshinoya take you out somewhere for a sketching 
assignment like usual?&quot;  

&quot;Not today, she said she didn&#39;t want the Principal to see her.&quot;

&quot;Right, right, not with that military get-up.  I wonder if she&#39;ll ever 
mellow out on those things, it would make the Principal go easier on 
her.&quot;  Sae shook her head.

&quot;What did you do today, then?&quot;  Hiro spoke up.

&quot;We still did sketches,&quot;  Miyako said, &quot;Just in the classroom.  I got to 
draw Yuno-chi.&quot;

Yuno nodded, &quot;And I did Miya-chan.&quot;

&quot;Can I see, or did she keep them?&quot;  

Yuno and Miyako pulled out their sketch pads and handed them to Sae.  
She handed one to Hiro and they flipped them open.

&quot;Hey, this is really good.&quot;  Sae said, loosing a low whistle as she 
looked over Yuno&#39;s pad, &quot;That&#39;s Miyako for sure, I swear she&#39;s gonna 
jump right out at me, and probably fall over.&quot;  Miyako stuck her tongue 
out at the grinning Sae, then turned to Hiro.

&quot;Well?  How about mine?&quot;  She asked eagerly.  Hiro chewed a lip.

&quot;Why do you have two of them, Miya-chan?  And full-body sketches?&quot;  
Miyako looked blank for a moment, then brightened.

&quot;Oh, no!  Turn a couple of pages over.&quot;  She instructed.  Yuno looked 
over at Miyako sharply.  So the sketches from the other night had been 
sketches of her?  But would Miyako really be that embarrassed about 
having sketched Yuno?  Unless... imagination running away with her, Yuno 
started thinking of ample reasons why Miyako wouldn&#39;t want to show her 
the sketches.  She firmly clamped down on them, though, thinking that 
Hiro probably would have exhibited more of a reaction in that case.  A 
light intake of breath from Hiro told them that she&#39;d come to the real 
sketch.

&quot;These are really, really good.&quot; Hiro echoed, looking between them both, 
&quot;Setting a new standard for yourselves this early in the year?&quot;

&quot;No, no, it&#39;s nothing like that.&quot;  Yuno said, waving a hand at Hiro 
abashed.  Unseen by Yuno and Miyako, their friends shared a concerned 
glance.  

Yuno kept an apprehensive eye fixed on the sky.  She didn&#39;t like rain 
much, often it seemed as though the quality of her day would go downhill 
with the quality of the weather.  That, certainly, was the last thing 
she needed to happen now.

Then the downpour came. 

First a few lonesome drops, that Yuno only noticed from the spots that 
appeared on the pavement, then sheets and sheets of wet coursed down 
from the clouds, instantly blanketing them and their clothes in 
moisture.  Yuno was suddenly very thankful for her school bag&#39;s glossy 
waterproof finish and secure  closure as she hoisted it above her head 
to keep off the rain.  She and the others broke into a light jog across 
the street.  Miyako was in front of her, and Yuno noticed with chagrin 
that her backpack was cloth; moreover, it didn&#39;t look at all in good 
repair.  Yuno kept pace with her friend and used her own pack to shield 
Miyako&#39;s instead of herself until they&#39;d reached the safety of the 
apartment overhangs.  Yuno had her eyes closed to ward off the 
rainwater, so she didn&#39;t notice when Miyako stopped and accidentally hit 
her in the back of the head with her pack.  Miyako turned back to her, 
taking in the situation at a glance and flashing a quirky grin in 
thanks, then shook her head, scattering rainwater everywhere, to the 
dismay of Hiro and Sae, and the amusement of Yuno.

&quot;Thanks, Yuno-chi, I&#39;d have hated for my pad and things to get wet. 
Didn&#39;t do much for you, though.&quot;  Miyako ruffled Yuno&#39;s wet hair.  They 
looked at one another for a moment, then laughed freely at the sight of 
one another&#39;s bedraggled appearance.  

&quot;Um, Hiro, I think they&#39;re okay after all.&quot;  Sae whispered as she 
observed them.

&quot;Goodness knows I thought they were being silly earlier, they must have 
gotten over it.&quot;  Hiro agreed, looking relieved.  

The pairs separated at the stairs, Sae and Hiro going to their 
respective rooms while Yuno and Miyako headed up.  

&quot;See you later, Miya-chan.&quot;  Yuno waved as she left Miyako by her door.  
Yuno walked in and closed her door, then leaned back against it, 
counting to thirty.

Outside, Miyako opened her door and slung her pack in, then closed it 
and went downstairs.  She was already soaked, and it wasn&#39;t a cold rain, 
so there was no reason she couldn&#39;t go to the supermarket right now, she 
reasoned.  Coming off the last step down, she saw Sae leaving her room 
as well, though she had found the time to fetch an umbrella.  

&quot;Miyako?&quot;  Sae asked, &quot;What are you up too?&quot; 

&quot;I was going to the Berry Mart, I have a need for ice-cream.&quot;  

&quot;Since when do you have money for something like that?&quot;  Sae asked, a 
little bluntly, but truthfully.  Miyako wasn&#39;t the type to take offense, 
particularly when she knew it wasn&#39;t meant, so answered without rancor.

&quot;I saw fit to deem this an serious matter and dip into my emergency 
funds.  Although, if you&#39;re really worried, you could always treat me?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Well then, I&#39;ll be on my way.&quot;

&quot;Yuno?&quot;

&quot;No, Sae-san, I&#39;m Miyako.&quot;

&quot;No, you... Yuno, behind you.&quot;

&quot;Oh!&quot;  Miyako turned around.

&quot;Hey, Yuno-chi!&quot;

&quot;Miya-chan?&quot;  Yuno started out of her thoughts, she hadn&#39;t been paying 
attention and only now noticed the two girls at the bottom of the 
stairs.

&quot;So where are you headed, Yuno?&quot;  Sae asked her.

&quot;Um... um... the supermarket!&quot;  Yuno covered lamely.  Sae shook her 
head.

&quot;You&#39;ve been hanging out with Miyako too much, don&#39;t tell me you were 
planning on going without an umbrella too?&quot;

&quot;Oh!&quot;  Yuno yelped, &quot;I&#39;ll go get it... but, I just remembered, I have 
homework to do, bye!&quot;  She vanished back to the above path and 
presumably to her room.

&quot;We had homework...&quot;  Miyako mumbled to herself, &quot;It can wait.&quot;  She 
decided.  She started to march off into the rain, still coming down in 
moderate amounts, though lessened significantly since the initial 
deluge.  She was stopped by an irritated grab at her shoulder.

&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t, I don&#39;t want to have to deal with you getting a cold 
or something.  Under the umbrella.&quot;  Sae commanded, &quot;I&#39;m heading over to 
the market too, we&#39;ll go together.&quot;

&quot;Aye-aye, captain.&quot;

Yuno peeked out of her water-streaked window, and saw them leaving.  She 
sighed, then walked outside again, this time making it to Hiro&#39;s door 
without incident.  She knocked.

&quot;Hello?  Please, do come in!&quot;  Yuno heard from the other side of the 
sunny yellow door, and she opened it gratefully.

&quot;Yes, Yuno, is there something I can do for you?&quot;  Hiro asked politely 
from her table, where she sat reading a book.  She picked up a thin 
bookmark with a light periwinkle tassel and set it to the pages before 
closing it and motioning for Yuno to come sit and join her.  Yuno nodded 
mutely and took the invitation, sitting down across from her friend.  
She couldn&#39;t quite form what words she needed to start, but Hiro, 
watching her sit wordlessly, took that need away from her.

&quot;I was expecting you to come some time today, just not quite so early.&quot;  

&quot;Eh?  You were expecting me?&quot;  

&quot;Yes, Yuno, you can be that easy to read.  Especially when you take the 
time to put yourself down to paper like that.&quot;  Hiro explained with a 
kind smile, &quot;Something it troubling you, so of course I would be 
expecting you, as your upperclassman and your friend.  What can I do for 
you?&quot;

Yuno still squirmed, not knowing how to bring up what she really wanted 
to talk about, so instead focused on the first thing that caught her 
eye, &quot;What&#39;s that you&#39;re reading, Hiro-san?&quot;  Hiro looked surprised, 
then slightly embarrassed.

&quot;This?  It&#39;s, er, it&#39;s the first story Sae got published, it&#39;s always 
been one of my favorites.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot;  Yuno replied inquiringly, her curiosity sparked.

&quot;Mm-hmm.  I didn&#39;t even know about her work back then, you know how 
secretive she tries to be about her writing.  Even though we&#39;d been 
friends for so long.&quot;  Hiro looked thoughtful, &quot;We had both just moved 
into the Hidamari apartments for our first year of school.&quot;  Hiro smiled 
and flushed, &quot;I was afraid that she had become upset with me, because 
suddenly I hardly ever saw her or talked with her, even during school.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t believe Sae-san didn&#39;t tell you about it, you must have been 
worried.&quot;

&quot;A little bit, yes.  But I learned about her writing later, and you 
already know about all that.  It&#39;s not a very interesting sto--&quot;

&quot;No, Hiro-san!  There&#39;s more to tell, I can feel it.&quot;  Yuno always liked 
a good story.  It rather sounded like Hiro had a reason for this story 
being her favorite, besides the possibility of it being well-written.

&quot;Well, if you really want to hear it, okay.  One day soon after that I 
noticed she wasn&#39;t in the classes that we shared, and I got more worried 
about her.  All the times I had tried to go to her apartment before, it 
had been dark, and she hadn&#39;t answered.  I had just assumed she wasn&#39;t 
there, even when I was sure she was.  But this day I went over and found 
her... well, you&#39;ve seen how she gets if she runs into a deadline before 
she&#39;s ready.&quot;  Yuno nodded, Sae could forget to sleep, eat, go to 
school... which only worked for so long.

&quot;She was so exhausted, she&#39;d been working for twenty-four hours straight 
by then.  It wasn&#39;t hard to convince her that she needed to get some 
rest, and while she slept I could help but take a little peek at what 
she was doing.  That&#39;s how I learned about her writing and pen name.  I 
felt bad for her, all alone with a task like that, so I took the liberty 
of straightening up her room and having a meal ready for when she woke 
up.  At first she wasn&#39;t too happy, because she felt that she had 
&#39;wasted&#39; time by sleeping, and was horribly embarrassed that I&#39;d found 
out about her novel, but I hushed her and fed her, and that seemed to 
make her feel better, especially when I said I liked her writing.  I 
think that&#39;s about when we started getting especially close.  Every day 
after school she would go back to work, while I would keep her company 
and make her meals so that she could spend time on her book and still be 
able to eat.  Honestly, she&#39;s so hopeless.&quot;

&quot;How sweet!&quot;  Yuno interrupted, then clamped a hand over her mouth, 
&quot;Sorry, but that&#39;s a really nice story.&quot;  

&quot;I do like to remember it.&quot;  

&quot;So you like this story because it reminds you of that time?&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm.  She was still new at her job, then, and she didn&#39;t get quite 
so serious about it.  There was the eating and sleeping thing, but back 
then she never got as stressed and irritable as she can now.  I think 
she&#39;s told me before that it&#39;s a lot easier to start a story than end 
one, maybe that&#39;s why she gets so grumpy nowadays.&quot;

&quot;That could be it.&quot;  Yuno agreed.

&quot;I sure am glad she wasn&#39;t always like that, though, or who knows how 
things might have worked out.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;You know how I talked about having to tiptoe around her during deadline 
time now?&quot;  Yuno nodded.

&quot;I didn&#39;t have to do that before.  I would stay in her apartment the 
whole time, doing laundry and dishes and cooking, whatever I could to 
help her out, and she wouldn&#39;t mind.&quot;

&quot;That sure doesn&#39;t sound like Sae-san from now.&quot;

&quot;No, but she&#39;ll be finishing this serialization soon, perhaps we&#39;ll get 
to see her like this again before long.&quot;

&quot;That would probably make things nicer for you, Hiro-san.&quot;

&quot;It would.  Now, wait, didn&#39;t you have a problem you needed help with?&quot;

&quot;It can wait, I have to hear this, you said something about &#39;how things 
might have worked out&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Fine, fine.&quot;  Hiro relented, it was sort of nice to talk about anyway, 
&quot;It was a few of months into that first year by then.  Even though I 
knew about her work and wanted to help, she wouldn&#39;t let me read through 
her manuscripts, she was too shy.  I kept up with her writing when it 
was released, though.  She would always blush whenever I talked about 
anything in her novels, which I found- and still find, she still does it 
after all- absolutely adorable, the way she&#39;d fiddle with her glasses 
and be so modest.  But anyway, we&#39;d continued the system we had from 
before when it would get close to deadline, me almost moving in with her 
for those few days, and a certain fortunate misunderstanding happened 
while I was over there on one of them.&quot;

&quot;You probably don&#39;t know, but sometimes Sae likes to read her lines out 
loud, to see how they sound in real life, to make sure she likes them.  
Used to be that she didn&#39;t have anybody around to overhear, so she got 
into the habit of doing that.  The first few times confused me, because 
I didn&#39;t know that she wasn&#39;t talking to me, but later I learned to take 
it in stride.  I tried not to point out when she did it, either, because 
she would always get so self-conscious and all out of her working 
stride.&quot;  Hiro started giggling now, uncontrollably, and it took her a 
minute to regain her composure while Yuno sat fidgeting.

&quot;Anyway, unknown to me, she&#39;d hit a writer&#39;s block, and decided to do 
what you might call the writer&#39;s equivalent of &#39;doodling&#39;.  You remember 
that story she was working on near the end of last year?  The Nanami and 
Kensuke one?&quot;

&quot;Yep.&quot;

&quot;According to her, this was when the idea for that particular story 
first started taking shape.  It took her a long time to actually write 
it for the serialization.  So she had switched from her regular story to 
this one, and the first scene she had in her mind was the confession 
part.  You know that Sae prefers to write from personal experience, so 
even though she wrote it out, she thought it didn&#39;t sound write.  To try 
and figure out what was wrong with it, she read it out loud.&quot;

&quot;Oh no, Sae-san.  She must have been so embarrassed!&quot;

&quot;Something like that,&quot;  Hiro replied, a dreamy smile on her face.  &quot;I 
was in the kitchen, preparing something for her dinner, when I overheard 
her talking.  I had learned not to pay attention to everything that she 
said aloud, but she didn&#39;t have a confession in the story she was 
working on then.  I thought she was confessing to me.&quot;  Yuno gasped, and 
Hiro laughed, &quot;So when she was done, I was blushing to my toes, just 
staring at the pot of water I was trying to boil.  I didn&#39;t know what to 
say, and I said so, &#39;Sae-san, I don&#39;t know what to say, this is all so 
sudden.  But, I know that for you, Sae, I could...,&#39;  I got that far 
before she just turned around and started blurting out apologies and 
explanations, and I had no idea what she was so distressed about.  It 
didn&#39;t matter, though, by the time we sat down and everything was sorted 
out, it was like she had confessed anyway, because she knew what my 
answer would have been.  She actually told me that she wanted to confess 
to me, but couldn&#39;t bring herself to it, so she was trying to express 
herself in writing her &#39;doodle.&#39;&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s so romantic, Hiro-san.&quot;  Yuno said, all caught up in the story.

&quot;You think so?  I always thought it was a little awkward and silly, but 
it&#39;s nice of you to say so.  Oh, and she didn&#39;t think the confession 
sounded wrong after that.  She had experienced it then, and all.&quot;  

&quot;Yes, about that,&quot;  Yuno started in earnest, seeing a path to her 
original concern, &quot;When she said it, how did you know that, you know, 
that you had fallen in love?&quot;  

&quot;I hadn&#39;t really known it until then.  I don&#39;t know how I didn&#39;t know, I 
had all the usual symptoms, but hadn&#39;t admitted it to myself until she 
came out and asked me like that.  I guess being in love with your best 
friend isn&#39;t something you tend to consider that often.  I think I was 
lucky to find out as soon as I did.&quot;

&quot;So you didn&#39;t know before...&quot;  Yuno said dejectedly.  Hiro raised an 
eyebrow at her sudden change of mood.

&quot;Yuno-san, you don&#39;t mean to say... do you think you might be in love?&quot;

&quot;Maybe.&quot;  Yuno replied evasively.  Hiro turned very serious.

&quot;Okay, have you been seeing this person at all?&quot;

&quot;Sort of.&quot;

&quot;How long?&quot;

&quot;About a year now.&quot;

&quot;That long!  Yuno, you&#39;ve been hiding someone from us, I didn&#39;t even 
suspect.&quot;  Hiro grinned at her, &quot;Okay, is it love, then?  Hmm... how 
does this person make you feel?&quot;

&quot;Er... you mean like, I&#39;m always happier when they&#39;re around, and all 
those other usual things, you know.  All warm and tingly and 
light-headed, like I just want float away...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve been seeing each other for a year...&quot;  Hiro repeated 
distractedly, &quot;Yuno, don&#39;t tell me that you, that is, have you, you 
know....?&quot;

&quot;What?  No!  I mean... just that first kiss.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re first kiss! So, how was it?&quot;  Hiro asked, somewhat relieved that 
it had only gone that far, it was hard not to feel like a protective 
older sister for Yuno.

&quot;Ah, different than I thought it would be.&quot;

&quot;How different?&quot;

&quot;Well, I wasn&#39;t expecting it, you saw, and she was asleep.&quot;  Yuno 
finally said.  She was halfway tempted to let Hiro keep her mistaken 
impression, but that wouldn&#39;t help her at all.  Hiro looked blank for 
the span of a few heartbeats.

&quot;You, you mean.  Yuno, are you talking about Miya-chan?&quot;

Yuno nodded wordlessly.

&quot;Oh!  Oh, ooooooohhhh.&quot;  Hiro said a few times, &quot;So, what you wanted to 
know whether you really felt about her that way!  But, Yuno, isn&#39;t this 
a little fast?  You know you probably shouldn&#39;t really consider that a 
first kiss--&quot;

&quot;I know, Hiro-san.  But, just like that wasn&#39;t really meant to be a 
confession from Sae-san but it made you think about it anyway...&quot;  Yuno 
trailed off, letting Hiro make the implied connection.

&quot;I see.  There is one big difference though, Yuno.&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot;  

&quot;With how that worked for Sae and I, it turned out to be a confession 
anyway.  For you, Miya-chan doesn&#39;t know how you feel yet.  You&#39;re still 
going to have to tell her, you know.&quot;

&quot;But I couldn&#39;t do that!&quot;

&quot;Why not, Yuno?  You&#39;ll never know if you don&#39;t try.&quot;

&quot;But what if she says no... but that&#39;s besides the point.  I mean, of 
course she would say no!  I don&#39;t even know why I&#39;m thinking like this, 
she&#39;s my best friend!&quot;

&quot;So?&quot;

&quot;So what?&quot;

&quot;Exactly, so what?  Sae&#39;s my best friend now.  Why can&#39;t you be in love 
with Miya-chan and be her best friend?  I think it would be pretty silly 
for the person you love not to be your best friend too.&quot;

&quot;Well, but, this is different...&quot;

&quot;Yuno-san, honestly.&quot;  Hiro looked sternly at her, deciding that a 
heavier hand was needed in this case, &quot;Haven&#39;t you read any romance 
stories with best friends?  Don&#39;t they always go through this too, &#39;oh 
no they&#39;re my best friend that can&#39;t be it&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but usually it&#39;s with a boy and a girl, not two girls, I thought 
it might work different...&quot;  Hiro sighed, tapping a finger to her 
temple.

&quot;No, Yuno, it&#39;s not really that different.  Love is love, after all, boy 
or girl or girl or boy.  I mean, there are the really obvious 
differences, but trust me, those don&#39;t really matter that much.&quot;  Yuno 
blushed, and Hiro continued, &quot;So yes, this is the same.  Don&#39;t let 
yourself go through that silly little phase.  I think I&#39;m nearly as 
surprised as you apparently are- Miya-chan, really?  But this part I do 
know, that you&#39;re not going to feel right until you talk to her about 
it.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Yuno, I&#39;m sure.&quot;  She said firmly, &quot;Like you said, you&#39;re best 
friends anyway.  If she says no, I think you two can still be best 
friends.  If she says yes... well, I&#39;ll let you find out those things 
for yourself.  But if you don&#39;t say anything, you&#39;ll always wonder what 
might have happened if you had, and that&#39;s not fun to do.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;  Yuno agreed fervently, then bowed her head.

&quot;But how do I just come out and talk to her about it?&quot;  Yuno pleaded.

&quot;That&#39;s something else you&#39;ll have to figure out for yourself.  You know 
how this works, the plan you get from a friend wouldn&#39;t work out 
anyway.&quot;

Yuno groaned.

&quot;Now now, cheer up.  Doesn&#39;t it feel nice being in love?&quot;

Yuno groaned again, and she laid her head on the table.

X-x-X-x-X-x-X-x-X

Splish-splash-sploosh!

Miyako ran and jumped through the puddles in the road while Sae looked 
on, chuckling at her exuberance.  She folded up her umbrella, which 
hadn&#39;t come in very handy.  Just a few minutes into their walk the rain 
had slackened to next to nothing, quickly as it had started.  She walked 
with the closed umbrella swinging at her side, hanging back a little bit 
from Miyako.  She&#39;d just started to dry out, she didn&#39;t want to get 
sprayed.  Like she probably would have if she had been closer, when 
Miyako took a flying leap feet-first into a large, filled pothole.  
Miyako stood, leaning over, in the miniature cascade she had created, 
staring at the ground for a few seconds.

&quot;You&#39;re a lot better at keeping up with me.&quot;

&quot;Better than who?&quot;

&quot;Yuno-chi.  It&#39;s probably because you have longer legs.&quot;

&quot;I guess.&quot;

The walked, or walked and jumped, a little further.  On one landing, 
Miyako spun as she fell to face Sae.

&quot;Hey, Sae-san.  About this morning, that didn&#39;t really count, did it?&quot;

&quot;Count as what?&quot;

&quot;A first kiss.  I mean, I was asleep.  You can&#39;t have a first kiss when 
somebody is asleep, can you?&quot;

&quot;Depends on how literal you want to be about that.  You were most 
certainly locking lips together, and I must say that it looked 
remarkably like a kiss.  But what&#39;s with this now, I thought you&#39;d 
forgotten about that already.&quot;

&quot;I dunno.  It&#39;s important to me, for some reason.  I thought I should 
find out if that counted as a kiss.&quot;  She looked sidelong at Sae, &quot;And I 
thought you would be an authority on the subject.&quot;  Sae flushed scarlet, 
but didn&#39;t lash back.

&quot;Maybe I am.  So what, you don&#39;t want to think that your first kiss went 
to Yuno?  Fine.  I&#39;m going to say... that it depends on who you were 
dreaming about- must have been a fun dream, from the looks of it.  The 
kiss counted if you were dreaming about Yuno, it didn&#39;t if you weren&#39;t.  
Therefore, it doesn&#39;t count.&quot;

&quot;That sounds very well thought out, Sae-san, very logical.&quot;  Miyako 
praised, and Sae grinned.

&quot;However, I have found the key fallacy in your line of reasoning!&quot;

&quot;Oh?  I have to hear this.&quot;

&quot;You had quite an important assumption in there.  The thing is, who I 
was dreaming about maaaaaaaaay have been--&quot;

&quot;Miyako, I&#39;m not in the mood for your gags right now.&quot;

&quot;What?  Wait, no, I&#39;m being serious!&quot;

&quot;You, serious?&quot;

&quot;As serious as your romance scenes.&quot;

&quot;Now wait, what&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot;

&quot;I mean really serious this time!  Are you saying you don&#39;t take your 
own writing seriously?&quot;

&quot;Of course I do!  But this- so you want me to believe that you&#39;ve 
suddenly stumbled upon secret feelings of love for Yuno, sometime this 
morning?&quot;

&quot;That makes it sound a little silly, Sae-san.&quot;  Miyako pouted.

&quot;That&#39;s the idea.&quot;

&quot;But you&#39;re making assumptions again.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t say that I stumbled upon them sometime this morning.  They 
were more like... that really fancy painting that you buy to put in your 
living room, because you think it looks kind of nice, but then you 
forget about it for a long time because now it&#39;s just part of the room 
you see every day, but then one day you&#39;re bored and you take a closer 
look at it and think, &#39;wow, I&#39;m glad I got this when I saw it!  I 
thought it just looked nice, but this is really very deep and pleasant&#39; 
and you start to notice all the little details for the first time.&quot;

There was a long pause.

&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s something like that.&quot;  Miyako stated again unecessarily.

&quot;So... Yuno&#39;s friendship is the &#39;nice-looking painting&#39;, and then you 
just accepted that for what it was, but now you&#39;ve taken a closer look, 
and suddenly you&#39;ve realized that you feel a little more than 
friendship?&quot;

&quot;Right.  I just hadn&#39;t been paying attention- I do that a lot.  I can be 
a little forgetful, and I had things to do, you know.&quot;

&quot;Like jumping in puddles?&quot;

&quot;Exactly, like jumping in puddles.&quot;  Miyako nodded sagely, &quot;And I 
thought that would be hard for somebody else to understand.  I 
underestimated you, Sae-san.&quot;

&quot;Miyako...&quot;   Sae sighed in frustration, &quot;Well now.  So you really 
believe all this?  You&#39;re sure you&#39;re remembering right?&quot;  Sae couldn&#39;t 
think of much else to say right now.

&quot;Well, I think so.  It was dark- there&#39;d been an earthquake you know- so 
I didn&#39;t get a good look at her, but she was short, and I certainly 
think she could have been Yuno-chi.&quot;

&quot;Are you even sure she was a she?&quot;

&quot;Absolutely.&quot;

&quot;Well, you&#39;re not sure who it was, though.  What do you think when you 
try to match her up with Yuno?&quot;

&quot;Actually, I think...&quot;  Sae was astonished.  Was Miyako blushing?  
Seriously?  She couldn&#39;t believe it, but there it was, &quot;I usually think 
that I would like to try that again some time, when I&#39;m not asleep.&quot;

&quot;Really now?  How interesting.  Any more details?&quot;  Sae asked, a little 
viciously, though in mostly good humour.  It wasn&#39;t often that she ever 
thought she would be able to tease Miyako, at least not effectively, but 
that blush had suggested she might get away with it.

&quot;Sae-san, you&#39;re a pervert!&quot;

&quot;What?!  No, I&#39;m not, I just...&quot;  Miyako grinned at her.  Teasing 
attempt failed.  Sae shook her head.

&quot;Never mind.  Well now, I guess there&#39;s only one thing left for you to 
do.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?  Oh, wait, I get behind her and you push?&quot;

Sae blinked at her, then stared hard at her unblinkingly cheery face.  
She thought it must have been at least a minute later before Miyako 
finally cracked.

&quot;Okay, fine.  I guess she should be awake too.  So what do I need to do 
now, Miss Sae?  Or should I call you Mrs. Hiro?  You should probably 
clear that up at some point.&quot;

&quot;Miyako?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Shut up for a moment.&quot;

&quot;Aye-aye, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Right.  What you&#39;re going to need to do, of course, is confess.&quot;

&quot;Oh, is that all?   I was expecting something complicated.&quot;  Miyako 
wiped her brow exaggeratedly.

&quot;W-what?&quot;  Sae spluttered, &quot;What do you mean, &#39;is that all?&#39;&quot;

&quot;Well, I was just exp--&quot;

&quot;Never mind!  Have you even thought about what happens if she says no, 
or how to go about it, or anything?&quot;

&quot;Should I?&quot;  Miyako looked innocently at her.

&quot;Um... I guess you don&#39;t technically have to.&quot;  Sae admitted.  Fretting 
usually didn&#39;t do anybody any good, and it&#39;s not like planning had 
helped her out at all in that crucial step.

&quot;Then what&#39;s the problem?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re hopeless, Miyako.  Don&#39;t  you have a romantic bone in your 
body?&quot;

&quot;My bones are at least fifty percent romantic.  Then there&#39;s fifty 
percent Doberman, fifty percent Cocker Spaniel, fifty percent Dalmatian, 
and fifty percent  GUTS!&quot;  Miyako grinned broadly and ran off again, 
jumping through puddles once more in the direction of the super market.

&quot;What the heck does that even  mean?!&quot;  Sae called after her, but she 
didn&#39;t get an answer.
