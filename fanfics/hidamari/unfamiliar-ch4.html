<a href="../hidamari/unfamiliar-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;Hello Hiro-san, Sae-san!&quot; 

&quot;Hi honey, I&#39;m home!&quot;

&quot;Hey guys,  you better come have some of Hiro&#39;s miso and steamed meat 
buns before we finish them all.&quot;  At the sound of the latter, Miyako&#39;s 
eyes flew wide open and she ran into the room.

&quot;But I thought they didn&#39;t sell those at this time of year!&quot; 

&quot;I made them, silly.&quot;  Hiro smiled at her, &quot;Just because I knew you 
liked them so much.&quot;

&quot;Thanks!  I love you, Hiro-san!&quot;  Miyako took two great exaggerated 
steps towards her with her arms open wide, then stopped stock-still and 
looked at Sae.

&quot;I&#39;m not going to die, am I?&quot;

Sae gritted her teeth, &quot;Not unless you keep that up, Miyako!&quot;

&quot;Then you won&#39;t mind if I give her a--&quot;

&quot;Sit!&quot;  Miyako flopped to the floor, &quot;Okay.  Oh, does this mean I can 
join in, I noticed you two seemed to like sitting.&quot;

&quot;Miyako, I think that&#39;s plenty enough!&quot;  Sae looked as though she may 
have been approaching a crimson color yet undiscovered by humanity.  
Yuno hid a small grin and sat down at the table, listening to their 
back-and-forth.  Miyako always seemed to have a knack for taking things 
so un-seriously that nobody could have felt awkward- to an extent, at 
any rate, Sae certainly felt uncomfortable, but not in a truly negative 
way- even if they had wanted to.  Yuno thought that she may have been 
laying it on a little thick today, but it seemed to be working well 
enough.

&quot;How long are you going to bug us about that?  Can&#39;t people forget 
themselves once in a while without being reminded of it every day!?&quot;

&quot;It hasn&#39;t been a day yet, Sae-san, that was only an hour or two ago.  
Say, how long did it take you to cook, Hiro-san?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a quick subject change, Miya-chan.  Not too long, we took a trip 
down to the store and I was able to prepare everything in about 
forty-five minutes.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I see.  So then the time it took you to--&quot;

&quot;Subject change my foot, Hiro!  She&#39;s still got her mind--&quot;
 
&quot;What?  I thought it would be useful to know how long it takes for those 
kinds of things, knowledge is power and everything.&quot;

&quot;What kind of power could you get from that!?&quot;

&quot;The ways of the force are mysterious indeed, Sae-san.&quot;

&quot;Now what nonsense are you spouting?&quot;

&quot;Is there any seasoning you like for your soup, Yuno-san?&quot;  Hiro offered 
cordially, looking fondly over at the bickering friends, &quot;Isn&#39;t it nice 
of Miya-chan to set Sae&#39;s mind at ease like that?&quot;

&quot;No, thank you.  But you thought so too, Hiro-san?&quot;

&quot;Of course.  Things wouldn&#39;t be the same without Miya-chan talking like 
she does, and Sae talking back like she does.  Miya-chan is letting her 
know that there&#39;s no secrets, and no reasons for them, between friends.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s true.&quot;  Yuno said simply, &quot;And this soup is delicious.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t it a little heavy for you this time of year, though?&quot;  Hiro 
looked at her, wincing.

&quot;No, no, Hiro-san!  You look great, no diet necessary,  but I&#39;m just not 
used to you making food like this.&quot;
 
&quot;Well... I didn&#39;t really eat the past couple of days, I was getting 
hungry.  I thought it would be okay if it was like that...&quot;  Hiro 
explained self-consciously. 

&quot;Oh.&quot;  Yuno winced, &quot;Hiro-san, what happened?  You still look sad about 
something, even though you and Sae-san made up.  And why didn&#39;t you have 
rent or tuition this year?&quot;  Hiro twirled a loose lock of hair around 
her finger, and hung her head.

&quot;Like we said, no secrets among friends.&quot;  Hiro took a deep breath, and 
looked back up.  &quot;It&#39;s my parents, Yuno.  No no, they&#39;re okay!&quot;  Hiro 
quickly filled in, seeing the look of shock on Yuno&#39;s face, &quot;It&#39;s just 
that...&quot;  Hiro looked as though she were having trouble continuing.

&quot;They&#39;re on the conservative side.&quot;  Sae spoke up, unnoticed to Yuno and 
Hiro she and Miyako had stopped their banter and turned to listen to the 
more serious conversation, &quot;And they have pretty traditional views on, 
um, gender roles and marriage.&quot;  She let that sink in for Yuno and 
Miyako.  

&quot;Even so, I knew I needed to tell them that I... wasn&#39;t going to be 
bringing home a husband.  They knew Sae, and liked her even though she 
didn&#39;t quite fit in to their mold of a proper young lady.  Probably 
because you were always so courteous and polite, Sae.&quot;  Hiro nodded over 
to her, &quot;So I thought that maybe if it was her, my parents would be able 
to accept it.  But they didn&#39;t.&quot;  Yuno and Miyako gasped, the pieces 
clicking into place.  Sae continued again for Hiro, seeing that she 
didn&#39;t want to relive the experience more than she had to.

&quot;So they said she wasn&#39;t going back to &#39;that school&#39;, and definitely 
wouldn&#39;t be coming back to the apartments where I was.&quot;  Hiro nodded at 
her in thanks, but picked up her face, putting on a brave expression.

&quot;I was just able to convince them to let me come pick up my things 
without their escort- I told them I was going to be saying goodbye, 
which I had thought I was, even if I only thought it would be temporary- 
and I think you two know everything after that.&quot;  Hiro turned to Sae 
again, a hopeful expression on her face.  &quot;Really, I think if they just 
have some time to think about it, my parents will calm down, Sae.  
Really.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure they will, I think so too.&quot;  Sae replied comfortingly, and 
laid a hand atop Hiro&#39;s, though Yuno thought she looked hesitant, and 
not really so convinced herself.  Yuno struggled to think of a new 
subject to bring up.  

&quot;Hiro-san, now that you&#39;re going to be going to school after all, don&#39;t 
you need to go register for what classes you&#39;re going to take?&quot;

&quot;No, I already took care of that last year.  A few hours ago I though I 
was going to have to go let the school know I wasn&#39;t attending, but now 
that my tuition is paid it&#39;s just like any other year.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot;  Yuno nodded.

&quot;What classes do you take, anyway?&quot;  Miyako popped in.

&quot;Me?&quot;  Hiro placed a hand demurely to her breast, &quot;Nothing fancy, just 
the regular academics classes and a third year general arts class.  Why 
do you ask, Miya-chan?&quot;

&quot;I thought you might be taking a sculpting class.&quot;

&quot;Sculpting?  Why on earth would you think I&#39;m a sculptor?&quot;  

&quot;Oh, Miya-chan, hahaha.&quot;  Yuno interrupted quickly, shooting her a 
pleading look to not say any more, then she faced Hiro, &quot;We were just... 
um, talking about what kind of art you might do here, Hiro-san, and she 
somehow became convinced that you must be a sculptor.&quot;

&quot;No such luck, Miya-chan.&quot;  Hiro answered, &quot;I&#39;m not specially talented 
at any kind of art like you three are.&quot;

&quot;Oh no, Hiro-san, I&#39;m not that good at all.&quot; 
&quot;Hey, Hiro, I don&#39;t have any special talent.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m specially talented?  Neat!&quot;

The three girls, sans Miyako, protested, but Hiro just smiled.

&quot;No, you&#39;re paintings are lovely, Yuno. Sae, you&#39;re getting much better 
with your drawing, I bet you&#39;ll be good enough to start illustrating 
your own works soon, and Miya-chan... I&#39;m not sure what you do, but I 
bet your mind looks something like an abstract piece of art, you&#39;re 
creative.&quot;  Miyako nodded her head sagely.

 &quot;Curses, Hiro-san, you stumbled onto my secret.  On the outside known 
to the world: Miyako.&quot;  She said grandiosely, posing with her chest 
thrust out and hands on her hips.  Then she tilted her head to the side 
and twisted her mouth grotesquely, crossed her eyes, and pulled her nose 
to the side and one eyelid with her hands, &quot;And on the inside: Miya 
Picasso, eccentric genius!&quot;  She turned to Yuno and puckered at her with 
sucked-in fishy lips until the other girl covered her eyes.

&quot;Yaaah!  Stop with that face, Miya-chan, please.&quot;  Sae and Hiro started 
laughing, and Miyako resorted her features and joined them.  After a 
moment, Yuno did as well.

&quot;So why are you here, Hiro-san, if you aren&#39;t focusing on being some 
kind of artist?&quot;

&quot;Right now the only other thing I could think of is interior design or 
culinary school, but those cost a lot more money to go to than just an 
art-focuses private secondary school.  I can still work on a sense of 
artistry that will go well if I decide I still want to do something like 
that, and I don&#39;t have to make any expensive choices yet.&quot;

&quot;From what she told me,&quot;  Sae smirked, addressing Yuno and Miyako, &quot;She 
had to talk pretty fast so her parents would let her come here.&quot;  

&quot;That too,&quot;  Hiro agreed, &quot;When I was looking at schools, I was already 
pretty sure that I wasn&#39;t quite as conservative as they were, and didn&#39;t 
really look forward to going to one of the schools they wanted me to go 
too.  I ended up talking a lot about how since this school was in a 
smaller town, it wouldn&#39;t have any &#39;urban youth corruption&#39;, and other 
such things, along with bringing up that it was cheaper than their 
schools, too.&quot;

&quot;Wow.&quot;  Yuno said, eyes dreamy, &quot;It&#39;s sort of funny, now that I think of 
it, but Hiro-san is a rebel in her family.&quot;  They all thought about 
that, the demure and proper ladylike Hiro: a rebellious teen.  This sent 
everybody, even Hiro, into another fit of giggles.

&quot;Can I ride your motorcycle later, Hiro-san?&quot;  Miyako asked grinning.

&quot;Sorry, but I have a cause, so I don&#39;t need a motorcycle.&quot;  Hiro 
answered with a straight face.  Sae and Yuno looked blank,  but Miyako- 
who by chance had seen that old American film- laughed.

&quot;What&#39;s that got to do with anything?&quot;  Sae asked.

&quot;Nothing really.&quot;  Hiro answered, &quot;There&#39;s just an old American movie 
called &#39;Rebel Without A Cause&#39; that&#39;s something of a classic over there, 
and it featured a violent young man with a motorcycle.&quot;  They might not 
have seen the movie, but Sae and Yuno had heard enough similar things 
about biker gangs to grin at trying to plug Hiro into those positions.  
Yuno recalled something Hiro had said earlier, and spoke to Sae.

&quot;Hiro-san said you were getting good with your illustrations, Sae-san, 
but I just wondered something.  If you have to write the story and do 
the art, won&#39;t that make it really hard to meet your deadlines?

&quot;Nah.  One of the reasons I&#39;m so stressed out by deadlines right now is 
because my co-creator can&#39;t even start drawing until they get my 
manuscript, so whenever I&#39;m late I&#39;m taking time from somebody else.  If 
I did the whole project, I wouldn&#39;t have to waste time sending the 
manuscript somewhere else.  Plus, I would only start drawing after I 
finish this series and start my new one, and I could probably work out a 
better schedule with somebody, and get some more respect from an editor, 
if I&#39;m already a little bit established.&quot;

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t that be nice for you, Sae?&quot;  Hiro smiled warmly at her, and 
Sae nodded.

&quot;It sure would.&quot;  Yuno said, &quot;So when do you think you&#39;ll feel confident 
enough in your work to start illustrating yourself?&quot;

&quot;Soon, Yuno, soon.  Did you hear about the new third-year art teacher?&quot;  
Yuno and Miyako shook their heads.

&quot;According to what I&#39;ve heard, he used to want to be a mangaka, but 
ended up favoring teaching instead, though there are rumors that he 
still draws doujinshi under a pen name.  I made sure to transfer to his 
class when I heard he was hired, and I bet he can help me loads.&quot;

&quot;Lucky!&quot;  Miyako congratulated her good fortune.

&quot;Say, Yuno, Miya-chan, what about you two?  Sae already has a future in 
her novels, and I&#39;ve said what I still have thoughts for.  What kinds of 
things do you want to do when you get out of school?&quot; 

&quot;Not a clue.&quot;  Miyako said simply, and all three others felt bad when 
they weren&#39;t at all surprised with that answer.

&quot;And you, Yuno?&quot;

&quot;Um... I don&#39;t really know.  I really like painting, but I don&#39;t know if 
I&#39;m very good, and I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s hard to make a career as just a 
painter.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true.&quot;  Hiro spoke up, &quot;Maybe not selling pieces 
that you paint on your own, but you could probably do okay with 
commissions.&quot;

&quot;Commissions?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot;  Sae added, &quot;You know, book covers or portraits or murals, 
things like that.  You could still find time to try and sell your own 
pieces as well.  You should probably have some kind of backup plan just 
in case, though, or a little career to get you through hard times.&quot;  Sae 
sounded for all the world like a guiding older sister, as she often 
managed to, &quot;Do you have any idea what else you might like to do?&quot;

&quot;Ah... I&#39;m not sure.  Could I just be a secretary or something like 
that?  Oh, but I&#39;m not too terribly organized, and I can be 
forgetful...&quot;

&quot;How about a teacher?&quot;  Miyako suggested, &quot;Like Miss Yoshinoya.&quot;  
Everybody fell silent, and they all found themselves imagining Yuno 
dancing about at the front of a classroom in some form of either 
adorably cute or embarrassingly revealing outfit.

&quot;Or at least a teacher, you don&#39;t have to be too much like her, 
exactly.&quot;  Hiro amended the suggestion, &quot;In fact, I really could see you 
as an elementary school teacher, Yuno, you seem like you would be good 
with children.&quot;

&quot;Of course she does, she&#39;s best friends with Miyako over there.&quot;  Sae 
jerked her thumb over at the beaming girl.

&quot;Eternally youthful.&quot;  Miyako said genially, with absolutely no hint of 
having been offended, &quot;So I never end up a grouchy grandpa like 
Sae-san.&quot;  

&quot;Hey, I act plenty young, and... wait, what do you mean by &#39;grandpa?&#39;&quot;

&quot;Oh, is Hiro-san the grandpa then?&quot;

&quot;We can both be grandmas!&quot;

&quot;I can tell, grouchy grouchy.&quot;

&quot;H-e-e-e-y now, young whipper-snappers, quit yappin&#39; and carrin&#39; on 
now.&quot;  Three sets of eyes came to rest on Hiro-san, who had just done a 
remarkably passable impression of a crotchety old man.

&quot;I&#39;ll be the grandfather, Sae, you can knit the socks and bake everybody 
cookies, I&#39;ll just take it easy in my chair and yell at the television.&quot;  
Hiro smiled.

&quot;Hmm... maybe we could both be grandpa&#39;s then..&quot;  Sae muttered loudly.

&quot;You think that might confuse the grandchildren?&quot;  Yuno mused.

&quot;Nah, you know how kids are these days.&quot;  Sae said, then seemed to catch 
herself, &quot;Oi, I do make a good grandpa.&quot;

&quot;Miyako Picasso is right again!&quot;

X-x-X-x-X-x-X-x-X

Yuno&#39;s long exhale echoed audibly in her bathroom.  She started her 
bathwater running, and when it was full selected a deep, leafy green 
bath salt to go with it, feeling that it was a nice, spring-like color 
that made her think of growth and life.  Immersing herself to the ears, 
she lay back and allowed her head to gently float on the surface of the 
bathwater.  Like always, she valued this time for relaxation and 
thought.  Today had been hectic, but here she was at the end of it, and 
everything was almost like it used to be.  If anything, her friends 
seemed even closer now; she now knew exactly how close Sae and Hiro 
were, and they weren&#39;t keeping it a secret any long, which made Yuno 
feel as though they&#39;d all taken a small step to a closer friendship.  
She let her mind drift through the day... seeing Miyako so early from 
getting off the train, running into Sae and Hiro like a car into a train 
wreck, piecing together everything... the morning wasn&#39;t fun, at least 
not most of it.  Miyako had certainly done as much as she could to keep 
Yuno&#39;s spirits up.  She felt warmer and safer with that thought, knowing 
that Miyako was right next door, somebody who cared about her that much.  
That brought to mind their conversation  from before dinner with Sae and 
Hiro.  Miyako had been asking her about, of all things, boys, and it 
looked like she hadn&#39;t held that thought like Yuno asked.  

Boys... she remembered Sae&#39;s long objections to speculation about her 
romantic history.  According to her she had been gunning to 
single-handedly break every heart in the school, and had just about 
succeeded.  It wasn&#39;t a big surprise that they hadn&#39;t believed her... a 
slightly bigger one was why she had felt the need to object so 
strenuously.  Sae had known what Hiro&#39;s parents were like, did she just 
express her profound interest in boys out of habit?  Yuno giggled.  
Their cool, collected friend could be awfully excitable sometimes, and 
those times usually coincided with Hiro being involved.  Yuno sighed, 
wondering if she might ever make somebody lose their composure, if 
somebody might feel that way about her some day.  

Romance... surely it would come to her some day.  Her friends all told 
her she was cute, and she wasn&#39;t even out of high school yet, so she 
didn&#39;t need to think about it too much.  But still, sometimes that 
fairytale love-at-first-sight, whirlwind romance seemed to be less and 
less of a possibility.  She would stay confident and hopeful, though!  
It would happen, she would come face to face with somebody, and 
something would pass between them, and she would get butterflies in her 
tummy and feel all funny and warm inside.  She would always smile when 
she saw them, and they would always smile back, and no matter what was 
going on, they would be happy together.  

Hmm... but was she sure she would know it when it came?  In the stories, 
the characters never really seemed to know at first, they would feel all 
funny, and maybe even sometimes they would ask themselves, &quot;Is this 
love?&quot;, but a lot of times too they would end up not knowing about it or 
trying to convince themselves that it wasn&#39;t love, and while that could 
make for a good story Yuno didn&#39;t want it to happen to her.  Was there 
any time she could think of that she might have felt something like 
that, even a little bit, so she would recognize the feeling when it was 
for real?  She thought deeply, trying to think of any time, with 
anybody, she might have felt anything like the passing or the tummy or 
the warmth...

&quot;Yuno-chi!&quot; A voice echoed in her mind.  What was that?  Yuno frowned... 
she supposed, yes, with Miyako.  Wasn&#39;t that funny, today when she had 
met Miyako and been with her in person for the first time in a few 
months, hadn&#39;t she felt something peculiar?  When her friend had looked 
so deeply into her eyes, or when she had held her after they&#39;d seen 
their friends so upset and angry and Yuno had broken down, or later when 
in a friendly little scuffle Miyako had grabbed her arms... hadn&#39;t she 
felt oddly lightheaded, and her tummy had done flips and felt weird, and 
she felt so warm and content inside... wasn&#39;t that odd?  What a 
coincidence.  Maybe love felt something like that.  Probably a good deal 
bigger, though, she thought.  Yes, well now she thought she had an idea 
of the feelings, all she had to do was wait for somebody to come along 
and make her feel like that, and that would be the person for her.  

&quot;Yuno-chi?  Yoo-hoo, helloooo, Yuno-chi?&quot;  Yuno&#39;s eyes fluttered open, 
the voice kept sounding in that resonant tone... but it wasn&#39;t in her 
mind, it was through the water, she realized.  She lifter her head clear 
of the surface, and listened for what she was sure Miyako calling her.  
Instead, the bathroom door slid open and she was there.

&quot;M-Miya-chan!&quot;  Yuno yelped, covering up with her hands out of reflex, 
pulse jumping- though this wasn&#39;t the first time Miyako had just popped 
in during her bath. &quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot;

&quot;I think I lost my number three pencil, do you have an extra?&quot;

&quot;Sure, it&#39;s, um... it&#39;s in my bedside table, in a little box in the 
drawer.&quot;  

&quot;Thanks, Yuno-chi.&quot;  She left, and Yuno heard her rummaging and then 
leaving.

&quot;I&#39;ll return it tomorrow.  I just felt like sketching tonight, can&#39;t 
sleep.&quot;  Miyako called over her shoulder before she left.  Yuno breathed 
deeply, sinking back in the water.  Yeah, it sure would be nice when 
somebody came along who would make her pulse race, and her insides do 
flips, and warm her heart.  She couldn&#39;t wait.  

She finished her bath and dressed in pajamas.  Setting her alarm, she 
climbed into bed and slid under the covers.  Unlike Miyako, the day had 
exhausted her, and she fell right asleep.  She had vague, ethereal 
dreams.  She was laying somewhere, but she couldn&#39;t quite see.  She felt 
like there was somebody next to her, and it felt like the most important 
thing in the world to look at them, but she wouldn&#39;t turn around.  She 
started fidgeting, wanting to look but not looking, but then the world 
started to come into view.  She lay under the soft, subdued light of a 
golden-amber sun, on a carpet of fine, fine yellow grass, smelling of 
flowers.  She heard above her head a stream gurgling along, and she 
swore that there was something worth hearing in that sound, but once 
again though she felt it was important to know what it was, she didn&#39;t 
focus on it.   Above her a light, gusting breeze blew over, cleaner than 
any air she had ever breathed, and as it caressed her cheeks she felt 
the odd compulsion to touch it back, but it was only wind.  Despite her 
odd, uneasy and unfulfillable desires, the sun was pleasantly warm, and 
the breeze gentle, and the brook lulled her senses with its music, and 
she was content enough for now.
