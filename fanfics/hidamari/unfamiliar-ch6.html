<a href="../hidamari/unfamiliar-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&quot;Okay, everyone, settle down.&quot;  Yoshinoya chided them cheerfully, crack!  
The sharp snap of her new riding crop on her desk made for quick 
compliance.  Yoshinoya appeared to realize that she was smiling far too 
cheerfully for a hard-bitten military officer, and tried to arrange her 
face into some measure of severity.  She failed, to a chorus of giggles 
and general amusement from the rest of the class.  Crack!  Again she 
slapped the desk, giving up on a serious expression.

&quot;It&#39;s so nice to see all of your faces again!&quot;  Crack!  The students 
winced at the sound.  Unconsciously, they found themselves sitting 
straighter in their desks, carrying themselves in such a way as to 
appear the textbook example of perfect classroom behavior.  They weren&#39;t 
sure if they were actually doing something wrong, but they didn&#39;t want 
her flailing about all day with her new toy.  Crack!

Yoshinoya didn&#39;t seem to notice her students flinching every time, it 
didn&#39;t sound so loud to her under her padded helmet, &quot;Now, I usually 
like to start off the year with a nice, simple drawing assignment.  It&#39;s 
such a nice day, too, but because I don&#39;t want the principal to see me, 
why don&#39;t we find some nice motif in here?&quot;  Her eyes roamed over the 
room, and she swished her crop around negligently.  

&quot;I&#39;ve got it!  Why you all pair up and use a partner as a model?  That&#39;s 
easy.  If there&#39;s an odd number of people in the class, of if there&#39;s 
any groups that just prefer, I&#39;m completely willing to pose for you.&quot;  
There were an even number, and when all the milling around was done they 
all preferred to sketch a classmate.  It wasn&#39;t so much that they didn&#39;t 
like their teacher, or didn&#39;t think she would make a good model, it was 
just that she was fond enough of posing that she wouldn&#39;t stay still 
long enough for a proper sketch.  Combine that with general 
unwillingness to present the teacher with a bad sketch of herself, and 
it was a rare occasion when anybody took her up on her frequent offers 
of modeling.  Yuno and Miyako had, of course, immediately turned to one 
another when Yoshinoya had explained the nature of their assignment.  
Then, unusually, they had both looked away.  Miyako smiled tentatively 
at her.

&quot;Yuno-chi, partners?&quot;  

Yuno looked relieved, &quot;Of course.&quot;  They opened their desks to gather 
their materials.  Yuno took out her new sketchbook for this year and 
flipped it to it&#39;s fresh first page.  She was glad to see that Miyako 
had gotten a new sketchbook as well, but then she noticed that Miyako 
flipped over her first page, and Yuno saw a drawing on the back, though 
it was hidden under the back of the pad before she could make it out.  

&quot;Miya-chan, what were you sketching that other night?&quot;  Yuno asked 
curiously, trying to break some residual awkwardness.  Miyako looked at 
her for a moment, wide-eyed, then flipped another page over to 
completely obscure whatever it was.  

&quot;Nothing, nothing.  I&#39;m a little embarrassed and don&#39;t want to show it.&quot;  
Yuno blinked.  Miyako, embarrassed?  &quot;So, we need to take turns at 
this,&quot;  Miyako continued quickly, &quot;Would you like to go first, or would 
it be better if I--&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;ll go ahead and go first.&quot;  Yuno said quickly.  Sketching was 
relaxing, and it kept her eyes moving and busy.  If she was the model 
she wouldn&#39;t have much more to do than to sit there, be still, and watch 
Miyako work.  So she picked up her pencil and held it before her, trying 
to get a good sense of depth and perspective on her motif.  Target 
locked on, she thought involuntarily, though with a smile, as she always 
did now.  But then she frowned.  Her perspective was fine, but there was 
something amiss with her subject.

&quot;Miya-chan, what&#39;s wrong, why do you look so sad?&quot;

&quot;Sad?  I do?&quot;  Miyako said, genuinely surprised, &quot;I... I suppose I am, a 
little bit.&quot;  She&#39;d been watching Yuno, and she looked so jumpy and 
preoccupied, even the smiles she directed at Miyako put atop a layer of  
and Miyako was almost certain it was because of her.  She felt a little 
hurt, it was just one little mishap.  Could Yuno really think that 
Miyako was trying to do those sorts of things to her all of the time 
now?  Normally, if she thought that somebody had a misunderstanding 
about her, Miyako would have no trouble at all swiftly talking to them 
and trying to correct that mistake.  There was just one problem with 
that, this time, and that was Miyako&#39;s memory.  In all reality, there 
was absolutely no reason whatsoever to even think that Yuno was the girl 
from her dream.  She didn&#39;t know how that little thought had snuck into 
her head, but she couldn&#39;t seem to get rid of it.  Going even further, 
there was a good reason that Yuno wasn&#39;t the girl, and that was because 
she was her best friend, and she just wanted her to be a best friend, 
she didn&#39;t... she didn&#39;t feel...

That was as far as she&#39;d been getting with this particular train of 
thought lately.  For the same reason she hadn&#39;t been able to just smile 
and pretend like everything was unchanged, or why she couldn&#39;t say that 
sort of thing to Yuno, she couldn&#39;t say it to herself; she was a bad 
liar.  She could tease and joke with a perfectly straight face, all in 
good fun, but this obviously was far out of that realm.  She could admit 
to herself easily that she thought Yuno was cute, and if her dream 
actions were anything like what had happened in reality, it had felt... 
nice.  Miyako ahd always known that she had really, really liked Yuno as 
her best friend, she loved her sweet, innocent, sometimes clumsy little 
counterpart.  It really didn&#39;t feel like that much of a stretched to 
think that she really, really loved her, as more than a friend.  She&#39;d 
been too busy being a friend to consider that she might not only want to 
be a friend.   Barring explanation, then, she could still try to talk to 
Yuno.

&quot;Yuno-chi, are you made at me?  I mean, you know that I... I didn&#39;t...&quot;  
Somehow, she still found herself trying to deny that to Yuno, spurred by 
her other chief motivation to set her friend&#39;s mind at east, but 
couldn&#39;t manage it.

&quot;What?  Mad at you?&quot;  Yuno asks in return, her turn to be surprised now, 
&quot;No, not at all!&quot;  Why would Miyako think she was upset?  She&#39;d just 
wanted to know why Miyako looked so sad, had she sounded harsh?  Was she 
acting like she was upset since this morning?  She wasn&#39;t, really!  She 
wasn&#39;t sure what she was, though.  Except that... what was it Miyako had 
just said?  She&#39;d asked if she were mad, and then.. that hesitant tone 
of voice, the unfinished though... what Miyako &quot;didn&#39;t&quot; was pretty 
clear.  Yuno thought vaguely that she should be happy about that.  Now 
that she knew for sure, there was no reason for her to think about the 
incident.  No reason to think about her first kiss.  She was probably 
being silly, anyway.  She knew that the first kiss was supposed to leave 
a girl dazed and confused, that&#39;s what she&#39;d been told, so it must be 
that it didn&#39;t matter who it was.  That was it.  That would explain the 
butterflies in her stomach and the unfamiliarity of her own thoughts.  
That would surely explain the sinking sensation in the pit of her 
stomach at Miyako&#39;s words.  Of course it did.

&quot;Oh, so you didn&#39;t-- I mean, why would I be mad at you, Miya-chan?&quot;  
Yuno tried her best to smile.  Miyako saw that she had to try, and 
wasn&#39;t very reassured.  

&quot;Okay, Yuno-chi.  Go ahead.&quot;  She said anyway.  Yuno picked up her 
pencil again, and used the incongruously somber Miyako as her model.

X-x-X-x-X-x-X-x-X

&quot;Okay, everybody, please come present me with  your work.  You can come 
up in pairs for criticisms.&quot;  Yoshinoya called out when they had about 
fifteen minutes left in the period.  Miyako&#39;s eyes moved from their 
patrol between Yuno and her sketchpad, and she noted a par of finished 
students moving up already.  

&quot;I think you have some time to finish, Miya-chan, sorry for taking so 
long.&quot;  Yuno apologized, though she really hadn&#39;t taken that long at 
all, and Miyako was about to complete hers in about the same amount of 
time.  Miyako nodded tersely, completely caught up in here work in a way 
that she didn&#39;t often feel.  She thought she felt a bit inspired by 
Yuno, who had achieved a similarly serious expression when she had gone, 
Miyako felt she should try and be so  conscientious of her own efforts.  
So she tried to get just perfect the line of her lips and the curve of 
the mouth just right, to show in some way with the light marks of dull 
gray the lightness of Yuno&#39;s eyes and the softness of her hair; to lay 
out the gentle lines of her cheeks and jaw, the attractively neat angles 
of her brown and nose, all in such a way as to somehow convey who Yuno 
was and what she meant to the person who had put her to paper.  

All to soon, it seemed, she wanted to look at her model one more time, 
to see if there was anything at all she might be able to do, but her 
model was gone.  Yuno was standing beside her, laying a hand on her 
shoulder, and telling her that they needed to go give Yoshinoya in their 
papers, all of the other students had done so and gone.  Miyako shook 
her head, shaking clear the odd daze that comes from concentrating on 
something very hard for quite a time.  She jumped up, and they walked to 
the front desk together.

&quot;My, you two, you looked as though you were really trying your very best 
on this assignment.  Let me see how you did.&quot;  Miyako extended her 
paper, but it met Yuno&#39;s in the middle.  They both retracted, halfway 
extended, made gestures of invitation with their hands, and finally 
Yoshinoya gently reached out and grabbed them both.  Yuno and Miyako 
waited expectantly.  

&quot;Oh wow, you two seem to have gotten much better since I had you in 
class last year, and you were two of my better students anyway.&quot;  She 
praised, looking down at the papers speculatively.  She turned to both 
of them.

&quot;These are such very nice sketches, Yuno-san, Miyako-san.  You really 
gave them everything you had, for someone close to you, and that love 
really comes through when someone looks at this.&quot;  She turned the papers 
over, and Yuno and Miyako both gave a start, they&#39;d not gotten to see 
the other&#39;s drawings yet.  They were incredibly different, but both 
breathtaking for what they were.  Yuno&#39;s work spoke of the world and the 
way the heart saw it, Miyako&#39;s work spoke of the heart and the way it 
was seen in the world.  While Yuno had used a very accurate, realistic 
style to show her feelings, Miyako used her feelings and a strange, 
mind-bending style to depict the realities of the world that couldn&#39;t be 
seen.  Yuno&#39;s representation of Miyako was gorgeous in both its reality 
and imagination.  There on Miyako&#39;s face was a carefree, lopsided grin 
that she knew she loved to wear, but that she hadn&#39;t been just now.  
Everything else about the picture, though, appeared frighteningly 
lifelike compared to the time that had been put into it.  You could 
almost count the hairs in the bangs that lay across her forehead.  It 
spoke of the reality of the Miyako in front of her, and the wish for a 
Miyako that she had known, juxtaposed into a lovely piece.  But while 
one could see so clearly how Yuno saw the world in her sketch, one could 
see ho Miyako thought about the world in her own.  There in the depicted 
Yuno&#39;s features was something that seemed to suggest to the warmth of 
her cheeks, the softness of her hair, the sweetness of her voice.  But 
just as easy to feel somewhere in the paper was distracted tilt to her 
head, the wistful turn to her lips, and the hint of melancholy hidden 
behind shining eyes.  

Yoshinoya looked a them speculatively, &quot;Obviously, you two are getting 
high marks for today&#39;s lesson, and I know to expect good things from you 
this year.  Might I ask to hold onto these sketches?&quot;  

&quot;Well, actually-&quot;
&quot;Actually--&quot;

Yoshinoya smiled, and wordlessly placed them back on the desk next to 
their owner, then got up and headed to the door.  They grabbed their 
sketches and went back to put up their things, then walked to the door.  
Yoshinoya was still there and holding it open for them.

&quot;Have a good day, you two.  Oh,and Yuno-san: Miyako-san probably has 
good reason for not smiling right now, she&#39;ll look like that again when 
she works through that.  And Miyako-san: Don&#39;t worry so much, you two 
are very good friends, and I&#39;m sure Yuno-san would tell you if she was 
upset with you.  Even so, if you two are worried about these things, you 
should find some time to talk about them together and stop being such 
wet blankets about the whole business.&quot;  

They blinked at her.  Yoshinoya had, on occasion, bestowed some gem of 
wisdom to her students in an uncommon display of intuition and maturity, 
but it still came as a surprise every time from the person they were 
just as accustomed to see whining about her parents or speaking with a 
trembling lip after getting scolded by the principal.  They looked at 
one another, a little sheepish at how awkward they&#39;d been behaving, 
though still not really resolved over anything.  

That&#39;s it, Miyako thought to herself, after school today she would go to 
the Beri mart, buy herself some ice cream, and give her mind a thorough 
inspection, a task she never took lightly, and rarely ever took at all.

Hiro, Yuno thought, after school today she would go talk to her older 
classmate, who would surely be able to help her with her questions, and 
who she could trust with what she had to say.  Sae would be good too, 
but she felt like Hiro would be more gentle in her reaction.

Nodding a simultaneous affirmative that neither noticed in the other, 
they headed out to lunch and the rest of their day.
