<h1>Familiar Unfamiliarity (part 3 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hidamari/index.html">Hidamari Sketch</a>

<a href="../hidamari/unfamiliar-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;Didn&#39;t I tell you no!?  I believe I said- quite clearly- that I wasn&#39;t 
going to make you support me!&quot;

&quot;But, Hir--&quot;  Sae started, turning her chair around and standing up.

&quot;Why do you have to be so stubborn!?  Why are you being so thick-headed 
about this!  It was my stupid choice to tell them, it&#39;s not your 
responsibility!&quot;  The force of Hiro&#39;s voice sat Sae back down.

&quot;Bu--&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not fair, Sae, why did you have to go behind my back like that?&quot;  
She had paced right up to Sae, and towered over the wincing girl.  Yuno 
and Miyako could only stand there, wondering if they should say 
anything, or do anything, or maybe just try to slip out unnoticed; Hiro 
didn&#39;t seem to acknowledge that they were there.  As they watched and 
considered, though, Hiro seemed to deflate.  Suddenly, two big, shining 
tears welled up in the corner of her eyes.  

&quot;That&#39;s just mean, Sae.  Why do you have to be so insufferably... why 
did my parents have to... oh!  Why do I have to love you so much?&quot;  She 
threw her arms around the thoroughly surprised tomboy and plopped down 
onto her lap, burying her face in her shoulder.  Yuno and Miyako 
couldn&#39;t tell if the muffled words spoken into Sae&#39;s shoulder were 
apologies or insults, but whichever they were Sae didn&#39;t seem to mind.  
All three girls breathed a sigh of relief, especially Sae.  Miyako 
smiled at Yuno, as if to say she knew everything would be fine right 
from the beginning, and took a step towards their friends.  She stopped 
in mid-stride when Hiro looked up, however.  She gazed into Sae&#39;s face 
with a peculiar half-lidded gaze, and Sae turned a little red- again- 
glasses slipping down the bridge of her nose.  Then before Yuno or 
Miyako could even begin to speculate what was going on, Hiro moved 
forward and they were kissing, long and deep and urgently.  Hiro&#39;s hand 
raised to tangle it in Sae&#39;s short, dark hair, while Sae&#39;s hands... 
managed to go down to somewhere somewhat less appropriate.

&quot;Wow!  Light pink panties for Hiro-san?  Miyako observed, as usual 
nothing shaking her for too long.  Yuno, meanwhile, blushed and covered 
her eyes with her hands.

&quot;Kyaaaaaaaaaaa!&quot;  Yuno yelped.  Hiro seemed to finally realize they were 
there, and Sae seemed to remember they were there.  The two froze and 
turned their faces to the two witnesses, Miyako looking on somewhat 
curiously, and Yuno with scrunched eyes covered by hands still.

&quot;Oh... um, sorry, Yuno-san.&quot;  Hiro said.  Yuno thought that was a sign 
that it was safe enough to look again.  She quickly changed her mind., 
whimpering and pointing towards Sae&#39;s lap.  Sae quickly realized she 
still had Hiro&#39;s skirt pushed up, and more embarrassingly, her fingers 
had slipped under the hem of Hiro&#39;s panties.  She withdrew them swiftly, 
and both girls parted with sheepish chuckles, standing up.

&quot;Okay, Yuno-san, I promise it&#39;s decent now.&quot;  Hiro said softly.  She 
peeked again, and confirmed that the two were now standing side-by-side 
and were not engaged in anything she shouldn&#39;t be seeing.  Hiro and Sae 
didn&#39;t look as though they really knew what to say now. Yuno had the 
rather strong suspicion that this is not how they wanted their friends 
to find out about their relationship.  Yuno&#39;s mind was similarly blank 
of suggestions.  Miyako, though she didn&#39;t know what might be good to 
say either, said something anyway.

&quot;Oh!  So Sae-san really is a--&quot;

&quot;No!&quot;  The two older girls shouted simultaneously, Sae looked as though 
she had less polite things to follow that up with, but Hiro placed a 
calming hand on her shoulder and talked instead.

&quot;No, Miya-san, not at all.  I can guarantee you that Sae is a girl 
through and through, and so am I.  We just happen to love each other 
anyway.&quot;

&quot;But that&#39;s not as fun...&quot;  Miyako pouted, &quot;There&#39;s no deep dark secrets 
and hidden histories involved there.&quot;  But Miyako&#39;s eyes smiled past her 
pasted-on frown

&quot;No, none at all.&quot;  Hiro said happily, &quot;Just me and the most wonderful 
girl in the whole world.&quot;  She looked towards Sae, and they shared one 
of the most tender looks Yuno could recall seeing from people in high 
school, and she was almost concerned they had forgotten everything else 
in the room again.

&quot;Now, Yuno.&quot;  Sae started now, &quot;I know this has to be a little bit of a 
shock, but this isn&#39;t really that unusual, you know, I mean, there are 
lots of girls who--&quot;

&quot;No, no, Sae-san, it&#39;s not that.&quot;  Yuno interjected, &quot;I&#39;m just 
surprised, is all, and I didn&#39;t think, you know, that you should be 
doing all of those sorts of things with people watching.&quot;

&quot;Well I guess that&#39;s true.&quot;  

&quot;I do wonder a little bit why you thought you had to keep it a secret 
that you were girlfriend and, um, girlfriend.  And... and... what&#39;s 
going on!?  You were just so mad, and then you were kissing, and now... 
I don&#39;t understand at all!&quot;

&quot;So... you don&#39;t have a problem with us, with two...?&quot;  Hiro left the 
question hanging.

&quot;Of course not!  You two are happy, and that&#39;s all that matters.  I&#39;m 
just hurt that you two thought you had to keep secrets and worried me 
and Miya-chan so much, and we still don&#39;t know all about what everybody 
was so angry and upset about.&quot;  As if remembering now that she had been 
upset at all, Hiro frowned a little, though with none of the hot anger 
she had displayed previously, and turned to Sae.

&quot;That still wasn&#39;t fair, Sae-san.  I told you that you shouldn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s fair?&quot;  Sae blushed, and her voice dropped to a quiet level, &quot;I 
can&#39;t think of anybody fairer than you, Hiro, so you&#39;re wrong.  Don&#39;t 
tell me you think it&#39;s better for us to be separated than--&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous, Sae.&quot;  Hiro admonished, &quot;But I don&#39;t want you to 
spend so much money on just me... I mean, rent is a lot of money.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t forget about the tuition.&quot;  Miyako supplied helpfully.

&quot;Tuition?&quot;  Hiro exclaimed, voice rising an octave and a few decibels.  
Sae shot Miyako a look of pure acidity, which went entirely unnoticed or 
uncared about by the blond smiling girl.  

&quot;Well, I kind of did them both before I knew you weren&#39;t going to be 
thrilled with the idea, it was supposed  to be like a gift...&quot;

&quot;A... a gift?&quot;  Hiro looked as though she were struggling to stay upset, 
but just couldn&#39;t manage it any longer, not against her lover, not for 
that kind of reason.

&quot;Yep.  I couldn&#39;t bear the thought of a year without you here, and I 
thought  you would be happy...&quot;

&quot;Oh, but I am happy, really!&quot;  Hiro hastily assured her, turning 
one-hundred eighty degrees in the blink of an eye, &quot;I mean... I guess 
there&#39;s nothing I can do to reverse it, and if you really, really wanted 
me with you so much... then I am happy, Sae.  Thank you.&quot;  Sae glowed, 
and became suddenly more agreeable to Hiro&#39;s point of view.

&quot;I guess I really should have talked to you about it first and all, 
though...&quot;

&quot;I would have just said no.  But yes, you&#39;re right.  Don&#39;t do it again.&quot;  
Yuno didn&#39;t think that such soft, cheery voices could have such hard 
edges, but she had been wrong.  It looked like everything was okay 
between those two again, though, so Yuno felt much better.  Struck with 
the realization that they were all still standing, and Hiro and Sae 
weren&#39;t making any moves to invite them in or become more comfortable, 
Yuno flushed again.

&quot;Ah, ahem.  Well then, I think that Miya-chan and I need to go unpack 
now, right Miya-chan?&quot;  Miya looked at her confusedly.

&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so Yuno-chi.  I only have my bac-omph!&quot;  Yuno&#39;s elbow 
had a little more force behind it than she had really meant, a nervous 
energy adding a touch more power.

&quot;Then I need your help, Miya-chan.  I think we need to go ahead and take 
our leave from Sae-san and Hiro-san for just a little while.  I hope you 
don&#39;t mind our running out so soon.&quot;  Yuno bowed a tad jerkily to them 
both.  Sae, linking her hands behind her head, laughed a little, and 
Hiro chuckled as well.

&quot;No, that&#39;s very all right, Yuno.&quot;  Hiro answered, &quot;We understand that 
you still need time to make yourself at home.  I think I&#39;ll try to 
prepare something so that we can all have supper together later, 
though.&quot;

&quot;That sounds great, Hiro-san, I&#39;ve been thinking about having one of 
your meals ever since we left!&quot;

&quot;Oh?  Don&#39;t your parents cook?&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm, and they make great food, but I like yours too.&quot;  

&quot;Thank-you, Miya-chan.&quot;  

&quot;Uh... no problem, Hiro-san.&quot;  Miyako said, moving across the floor 
under a flushing Yuno&#39;s desperate pulling, &quot;I guess I&#39;ll be back later, 
although I don&#39;t seem to be operating under my own power right now.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s go, Miya-chan!&quot;

Miyako let herself be guided out the door, still densely unaware of 
exactly why Yuno found it so important to go right this very second.  
Hiro and Sae watched the girls leave in amusement, turning back to one 
another after the door had clicked shut.  After a long silence, Hiro 
offered first speech.

&quot;I think that I maybe overreacted a little bit.&quot;  

&quot;A little bit.&quot;  Sae agreed, &quot;Still, we&#39;re okay now, right?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll always be okay, Sae.&quot;

&quot;I guess this turned out pretty good anyway, then.  Um... how much did 
the Landlady end up finding out?&quot;  Sae inquired, and Hiro looked 
embarrassed.

&quot;Most of everything.  It&#39;s really hard to hide anything from her, I 
think she just directly and specifically asked me more things than I 
actually had to tell her.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it.  I just wanted to know.  We don&#39;t have to keep 
&#39;us&#39; a secret any more, you know.  I mean, your parents know, I don&#39;t 
think that too many people could do worse than that...  oh, wait, I&#39;m 
sorry.&quot;  Sae bit her lip, immediately regretting her words.  Hiro looked 
troubled again, but only for a few moments.

&quot;Now, don&#39;t worry about it, Sae.  It&#39;s not like we were planning on 
keeping our relationship a secret forever.  They were going to find out, 
and it was my choice to tell them, remember?&quot;

&quot;If you say you&#39;re okay with that for now... but at least we have Yuno 
and Miyako.  They seemed to take everything in stride.  They probably 
would have been less shocked if, you know, we had just told them before, 
instead of getting into a fight and then, um, making up from a fight in 
front of them.&quot;

&quot;Probably.  Yuno is such a good girl, and Miya-chan.... is Miya-chan.  I 
suspected they wouldn&#39;t be that disturbed by anything.&quot;  Hiro tapped her 
chin, &quot;In fact, hmm... you think they might have worked it out for 
themselves last year?  Like when I got that love letter, and you were 
just soooo jealous?   That, and I don&#39;t think you were ever really able 
to convince anybody about all the boyfriends you&#39;d had before, either.  
But that&#39;s okay, I like that my Sae isn&#39;t a good liar.  It lets me know 
that she really, really means it when she says--&quot;

&quot;I love you.&quot;  

Hiro smiled, then turned around and grabbed Sae by the shoulders.  In a 
display of forcefulness that she rarely, if ever, displayed in public, 
Hiro san pushed Sae back down onto her chair and climbed into her lap.

&quot;Yuno is a good kid.  Do you think she really knew that we preferred to 
be alone right now, and why?&quot;

&quot;I think so.  We weren&#39;t exactly too discreet, and she looked fairly 
desperate when she was pushing Miya-san out the door.&quot;  

&quot;Good.  I would hate to think that she went through all of that for no 
reason.  Now where were we?&quot;  Hiro purred, nuzzling Sae&#39;s neck.  Sae 
reached up and placed her hand on Hiro&#39;s cheek, picking the girl&#39;s face 
up and drawing it close.

&quot;I remember being somewhere over here.&quot;  She said, bringing their lips 
together again, &quot;And here.&quot;  She continued out of the side of her busy 
lips, moving her hands back into their previous position.  Sae felt 
Hiro&#39;s lips tighten under her own in a smile, and Hiro moved her hands 
down and slid them under Sae&#39;s shirt.  Sae encouraged this move, kissing 
more fervently as they started to tangle themselves in that passionate 
way only lovers could.

X-x-X-x-X-x-X-x-X

&quot;So what&#39;s the hurry, Yuno-chi?&quot;  Miyako asked Yuno once they were- 
safely, in Yuno&#39;s opinion- in Yuno&#39;s apartment.  

&quot;Well, er, Miya-chan, I think that they really would like some time 
alone to themselves now.  They probably have plenty to talk about, you 
know.&quot;

&quot;Oh, they needed to talk?  I thought that as soon as we left they were 
just going to--&quot;  Miyako said brightly.

&quot;Miya-chan!&quot;

&quot;What?  I mean, they are--&quot;

&quot;Well, yes!  But it&#39;s not nice to go out and say that.  And if you knew, 
why were you playing dumb and taking so long to get out of there?&quot;

&quot;Because it was fun to watch them shuffle their feet and look so cute.  
Well, that and I wondered if they might lose it and start up again 
before we left.&quot;  

&quot;Miya-chan, don&#39;t you have any shame?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think so, what fun is that?&quot;  Yuno sighed, sitting down at her 
table in defeat.

&quot;Hey, Yuno-chi, you know we still didn&#39;t get any answers about why 
Sae-san even had to go and pay for Hiro-san you know.&quot;  Miyako observed.

&quot;You&#39;re right!  But, um, we can ask them later.   Hiro-san said we would 
be invited over later.&quot;  Yuno spied her luggage still sitting by the 
door, and got back up.  She took a box off the top- a small one, that 
just contained her smaller or more fragile things- and carried it back 
to the table.  Miyako looked on, and came curiously to the table to see 
what she was up to.  She pulled out her traditional alarm clock and set 
it back on it&#39;s customary spot on her bedside table, moved to the 
bathroom and emptied out her rubber duck, bath salts, and a few soaps 
and creams and shampoos.  She walked back to the table, then, and set 
the box down, peering intensely around the room.

&quot;What&#39;s up, Yuno-chi?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m trying to decide if I want the rest of this stuff like I had it 
before.&quot;  She proceeded to pull out several little bottles of makeup 
items, lipsticks and nail polishes and mascaras, which Miyako found odd 
considering that Yuno hardly seemed to ever wear any of it, along with a 
medium-sized square bottle of perfume, imprinted with a large red heart.  

&quot;Hey, I remember this stuff.  I never did get to ask you, why do you 
have it all?  I&#39;ve never seen you use any.  I think I remember that nice 
perfume from the festival last year, but I know I&#39;ve never seen you with 
any makeup.&quot;  Yuno smiled a cute little smile.

&quot;I don&#39;t, but the set was a gift from Grandma when I started high 
school, so I keep it around to remind me of her.  The perfume was a 
Christmas present from Mom a couple of years ago, I just don&#39;t use much 
of it.  Hmm... I think there works.&quot;  She started arranging the little 
bottles onto a table to the side of the room.

&quot;Ah, I see.  Yuno-chi is a good kid.&quot;  Miyako nodded approvingly, then 
looked down into the box, &quot;Oh, and what are these?&quot;  Miyako pulled out 
three framed pictures, but these weren&#39;t photographs.  The first was a 
painting of an orange vase, the second an unfocused and blurry- but 
interestingly dynamic- painting of three people, and the last, oddest of 
all, was a glossy sheet of paper decorated with... various warning 
labels.  Yuno smiled fondly at them, taking up the last first.

&quot;This one I got for my birthday a few years ago.  It was the week before 
my birthday, and we had a really tough math test coming up.  I had 
stayed up late to study, and fell asleep at my desk.  I kinda forgot to 
set my alarm and overslept.  I was late for school, and was trying to 
run there and study from my book at the same time.&quot;  She winced at the 
memory, and Miyako started grinning, &quot;I ran right past the warning sign 
and between the roadblocks, and almost fell into a manhole, but one of 
the workers caught me first.  Then I got to school and rushed past a 
&#39;wet floor&#39; sign, fell down, and broke my arm.&quot;

&quot;Yuno-chi!&quot;

&quot;So I ended up telling the whole story to my mother and father when I 
was in the hospital later that day, and when my birthday came around 
they got me that, because they said if I saw them often enough, maybe I 
would be more careful and &#39;they wouldn&#39;t lose their precious daughter&#39;.  
They were laughing the whole time, so I don&#39;t know how serious they 
were, but still.&quot;  Yuno hugged the frame to her, then carefully put it 
up on the shelf where it was before.  Thinking that it did look good up 
there, she took up the other two and placed them where they had resided 
last year as well.

&quot;What about those other two?&quot;  Miyako asked.

&quot;The vase is something I made in middle school for art class, and what 
made the teacher tell my parents that they should consider an art 
curriculum for me.  The second one, with the fuzzy people, was from this 
&#39;aptitude test&#39; that Mom and Dad wanted me to take.  They told us to 
paint whatever we felt like, and I didn&#39;t know what to do, but I was 
sitting by the window.  I looked outside- we were on the third floor- 
and saw three people a little ways down the road getting their picture 
taken.  I couldn&#39;t really see them too well, but that picture stayed in 
my mind and I tried to paint them.  They said it was good for &#39;capturing 
the spirit and emotion without painstaking attention to detail&#39;.&quot;  Yuno 
removed the picture from the frame and turned it around so Miyako could 
see the hasty script displaying that across the back.&quot;

&quot;Wow, that&#39;s great, Yuno-chi.&quot;  

&quot;I think they might say stuff like that about a lot of things, but it 
still made me feel good, so I kept it.&quot;

&quot;Most people have photographs and stuff to remind them of their family, 
but you have pretty unique things.&quot;

&quot;So do you, Miya-chan.  Like your inflatable pool.&quot;  Yuno giggled, and 
so did Miyako.

&quot;Yeah, I guess that does remind me of my parents a little bit.  Come to 
think of it... All the sketchbooks and art supplies I have now they got 
me as a present for getting accepted here and getting a little 
scholarship for being an honor student before, so every time I do school 
work and doodle I think of them a little bit.&quot;

&quot;I think it&#39;s good to be able to think of people you love whenever 
you&#39;re doing your work, Miya-chan, I&#39;m sure it shows through.&quot;

&quot;You think?  Hey, I wonder what comes through in Sae-san&#39;s and 
Hiro-san&#39;s work, then?&quot;  Yuno was about to admonish Miyako for saying 
something indecent and embarrassing, but this time Miyako didn&#39;t look as 
though she meant that teasingly or anything, but instead looked really 
genuinely curious, and that open display of curiosity wormed its way 
into Yuno&#39;s mind as well.  

&quot;Well, they say a lot of great art is inspired by love, don&#39;t they?&quot;  
Yuno said, and Miyako nodded.  

&quot;Mm.  I wonder if Sae-san is able to use any of it when she practices 
for illustrating her own stories, she sure has enough places for a 
little love to get displayed, eh, Yuno-chi?&quot;  Yuno laughed a little.

&quot;I guess so, Miya-chan.  Maybe she can use that a little bit, but I 
wonder about Hiro-san.  You know, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen any of 
Hiro&#39;s projects.  I think she takes an art class, though, why else would 
she be attending our school if she wasn&#39;t?&quot;

&quot;Oooh, oooh, maybe she got a special acceptance because she was so good 
at making &#39;special&#39; art, you know, Yuno-chi.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Special art&#39;, Miya-chan?  What do you mean.&quot;

&quot;I mean, &#39;speeeecial&#39; art, you know?&quot;  When Yuno still looked at her 
blankly, Miyako stood up and went to whisper in here ear.

&quot;Miya-chan!  I don&#39;t think Hiro-san would be drawing or painting those 
kinds of things!&quot;

&quot;Oh, you think she&#39;s a sculptor then?  I wonder how long it takes to 
chisel out some of those details...&quot;

&quot;Miya-chan!&quot;  Yuno pounded her little fists lightly on Miyako&#39;s shoulder 
in protest.

&quot;Hey, hey, okay, I&#39;ll stop Yuno-chi.&quot;  Miyako caught Yuno&#39;s wrists with 
her hands.  They held one another&#39;s eyes for a moment, and Yuno again 
felt her stomach do a somersault, going up to poke around in an airy 
mind then screaming down for a fiery landing that warmed her to her 
toes.  It was just like when Miya was talking about reading her mind... 
Yuno blushed, she certainly hoped Miyako couldn&#39;t really do that, 
because Yuno had been thinking a little too much about what Hiro may or 
may not have been sculpting.  Come to think of it, Miyako had said that 
Yuno was happy to see her and wanted to buy her lunch... the first was 
true, and the second had come true...

&quot;Um, Yuno-chi, did you want something, or can I have my hands back now?&quot;  

&quot;Wha?  But you...&quot;  Yuno stopped, looking curiously at her hands, 
fingers linked with Miyako.

&quot;I let go of your hands about right after I grabbed them, but then you 
did this.  Why is Yuno-chi holding my hands?&quot;  Miyako asked curiously, a 
bright smile on her face.  Yuno blushed and let go.

&quot;I, ah, I don&#39;t know, Miya-chan.  I just, um... I don&#39;t know.  I didn&#39;t 
mean to, sorry.&quot;  Yuno finished a little lamely.  Miyako raised an 
eyebrow.

&quot;For what?&quot;

&quot;Um... for.... nothing.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re sorry for nothing?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just, I didn&#39;t mean that I was &#39;sorry&#39;, it&#39;s just that...&quot;  Yuno 
wasn&#39;t sure why she had said that, but really, did Miyako have to focus 
on it so much?

&quot;Oi, oi.  Okay, Yuno-chi, have your secret little thoughts.  I thought 
you were a good kid, but I wonder if I would still think that if I 
really could read your mind.&quot;  A smile and a wink told her that Miyako 
was only joking, but Yuno felt far more embarrassed about how close she 
thought Miyako had come to the truth, rather than because she was being 
teased.  

&quot;Never mind, Miya-chan!&quot; Yuno scurried over to what remained of her 
things and started unpacking them as well, revealing her lamp, bath 
towels, hanging up clothes and uniforms, putting her folders in her 
bedside table. Miyako looked on as Yuno emptied, in essence, most of 
what made the room hers from that little pile of boxes.  Miyako thought 
that was kind of interesting, that most of everything in any of their 
rooms didn&#39;t really look like it was theirs until they parked their 
possessions on them.  The shelf and bedside table and everything weren&#39;t 
really Yuno&#39;s, but when they had pictures and things on them, she 
immediately started thinking of them as &quot;Yuno-chi&#39;s&quot; shelf, and 
everything else.  Miyako didn&#39;t know that it really mattered to 
anything, but she found the realization interesting.  Yuno sat back down 
at the table when she was finished with a little puff of breath, pleased 
with herself at having the room back to looking like home.  Miyako 
looked sidelong at Yuno for a few long moments, thoughts returning to 
more recent thoughts of hers.

&quot;Say, Yuno-chi... you remember back at the end of the year when Hiro-san 
had gotten that love letter?&quot;  Miyako started earnestly.

&quot;Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Oh!  Remember how grumpy Sae-san got then.  I guess we 
know why now, I never would have thought that she would be the jealous 
type.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that time.&quot;  Miyako rushed along, with just a nod to acknowledge 
what Yuno had said, &quot;Remember when we were all talking about various 
kinda romantic things or encounters-hah!  We knew Sae-san hadn&#39;t had all 
the boyfriends she said she had, but anyway- you had talked about your 
Dad?&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm, I kind of remember that.  What brought this up, Miya-chan?&quot;

&quot;So... you&#39;ve never had any kind of experience with boys?&quot;  Miyako 
asked.  Yuno blinked.

&quot;Um...  no.&quot;  Yuno said, embarrassed.

&quot;I just thought that you&#39;d never really said, and nobody had really 
asked you before.  I mean, I didn&#39;t think so, but...&quot;  Miyako shook her 
head, frowning, and Yuno suddenly took her usually silly friend very 
seriously

&quot;Miya-chan, why are you being so serious all of a sudden?&quot;

I wanted to ask, then, if you had ever thoug--&quot;  Yuno&#39;s phone suddenly 
chimed loudly.

&quot;Oh, hold on Miya-chan.&quot;  She looked at her phone, then typed out a 
message, sent it, and put it away, then she turned back to Miyako, &quot;that 
was Hiro-san, she said she cooked early and invited us over to eat.  We 
can go in a second, though, what was it you wanted to say?&quot;

too quickly, and a little artificial sounding, &quot;The thought of 
Hiro-san&#39;s cooking drove it right out of my mind!&quot;  She said, lying 
about such an occurrence for the first time she could ever remember.  It 
wasn&#39;t that important, anyway, why did she want to ask Yuno that anyway?

&quot;Oh, Miya-chan.  Well, maybe you&#39;ll remember later, let&#39;s go ahead and
