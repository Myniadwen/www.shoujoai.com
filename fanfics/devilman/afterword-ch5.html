<h1>Afterword (part 5 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../devilman/index.html">Devilman Lady</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../devilman/afterword-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>The day dawned brightly. Jun woke, refreshed, with the surprising 
feeling of being hungry. Clearly, she was using much more energy now 
that she had an arm again than she had during all those days of 
near-immobility. 

After the Fall, she thought, then corrected herself - it was too easy 
to get caught up in media buzzwords - after she had defeated Asuka, 
after her wounds healed, after the sun once again rose on her city 
without screams of pain echoing through the streets, she had walked 
around a little. She had watched as the children played, blessedly 
unaffected by the fear that had nearly destroyed the world. And she 
had smiled as she saw tails, horns and wings add a fetching new 
component to the raw beauty of youth.

But then the reality of it all had set in. The death toll figures had 
mounted, and mourning had begun for real. And the darkness that had 
lifted from Tokyo had settled firmly over Jun, when she realized that 
her arms would not come back, and neither would any of the multitudes 
she had killed. Kazumi would never come back. Jun had lain down in her 
bed and simply ceased moving. While the city rebuilt and humanity 
continued, Jun had stopped.

Samuelson Laboratories had sent a nurse to care for her &#150; Jun supposed 
they felt partially responsible, and she had been content to let them 
feel that way. It was not her job to give them absolution for their 
role in the spread of the Devil Beast Progress. They had flown her to 
America once a month for tests, for more tests, then for training and 
treatment. Then for surgery - and therapy, both physical and 
psychological.

Jun had gratefully accepted the physical training, but had declined to 
speak at all to the counselor they had provided. It wasn&#39;t out of 
reticence...she had declined to speak out of pity. She had believed 
that no one should have to hear about the things she went through - no 
one should have to share that kind of pain.

She pulled the blinds aside and let the morning sun into the 
apartment. Dust became immediately apparent in the air, caught 
mid-motion in the sunbeams. Jun watched in fascination for a short 
while, then turned and surveyed the room. 

With a kind of trepidation, she took in the grungy surfaces of her 
desk, the table, sideboard and the undusted photos and books. She 
sighed heavily and turned to look out at the sparkling morning.

*If I&#39;m going to be alive then I had better begin right here,* she 
thought. It was time to clean the apartment.

 

Many slow hours later, after kitchen and bathroom, after three loads 
of laundry carefully and laboriously folded, after many windows, Jun 
was ready to crawl into her bed and sleep for three days. The shadows 
were long and the sun on the other side of the building. Her apartment 
was cool and dark...and clean. She sank onto a chair with a loud, 
self-satisfied groan.

The phone rang.

Jun stared at it in mingled amusement and annoyance. It was a wrong 
number.

The phone rang again, then a third time: Jun watched it, half hoping 
that whoever it was would give up, or realize they had the wrong 
number. No one knew this number - no one local. And there was no 
reason to be receiving phone calls from America at this time of day.

The phone rang again and Jun stood, slowly, unsure of why she was even 
bothering to answer it. 

One the fifth ring she lifted the receiver and spoke into it quietly.

&quot;Fudou-san?&quot; The voice was male, energetic, pleasant. &quot;This *is* the 
phone number of Fudou Jun? Hello? Hello?&quot;

Jun jumped. She had been so shocked to hear her name, she hadn&#39;t 
responded. &quot;Yes, I&#39;m Fudou.&quot;

&quot;Fudou-san! I&#39;m so glad this number worked. I don&#39;t know if you 
remember me, my name is Kandagawa, I work with Ommi, the sister 
publication of Kiki...&quot;

The words blurred in Jun&#39;s ear. She wasn&#39;t able to handle the noise. 
Her head hurt all of a sudden and she began to shake. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she 
interrupted the voice, &quot;I don&#39;t think I can help you.&quot;

&quot;But Fudou-san - just an interview and maybe a picture or two...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; she said, her voice quiet, but firm. &quot;I don&#39;t think that would 
be a good idea. I don&#39;t model anymore.&quot;

This last sentence seemed to have gotten through. Kandagawa hemmed a 
little, then said, &quot;Okay, no photos...maybe just one, for the 
article...or maybe the cover...and an interview.&quot;

Jun shook her head in irritation. &quot;I don&#39;t think, Kandagawa-san,&quot; she 
said coldly, &quot;that your readers would want a picture of me these 
days.&quot;

There was a prolonged silence, then Kandagawa said, &quot;Fudou-san. I 
think you&#39;re wrong.&quot; His voice was intense. &quot;And I think I can 
convince you of that. Will you agree to meet me at least? For tea or 
coffee somewhere - your choice?&quot;

Jun considered for a moment, then surprised herself by saying yes. She 
had nothing to lose - nothing to gain, perhaps, but a reason to go 
outside.

&quot;Great!&quot; The energy was back in his voice. &quot;Tell me where and when and 
I&#39;ll be there - no camera this time, but with a tape recorder if it&#39;s 
okay, and we&#39;ll talk a little.&quot; He paused for a moment. &quot;I don&#39;t think 
you realize how popular you are, Fudou-san. More than you ever were in 
the old days.&quot;

Jun laughed a little at that. &quot;Yes, I can tell. My agent has to beat 
the interview offers off.&quot; But the smile slid from her face at the 
thought of her late agent.

Kandagawa&#39;s voice lowered conspiratorially. &quot;That&#39;s because they 
didn&#39;t know where to find you. Mark my words, Fudou-san, your phone 
will soon be ringing off the hook.&quot;

Jun shook her head at the misplaced optimism, but chose a place and 
time for the assignation. It couldn&#39;t hurt, could it? She had done so 
many before - and after all, wasn&#39;t she the aging star? Magazine 
interviews were the inevitable result of a past career. She finished 
with the usual formalities and put the phone down in its cradle.

The phone rang. 

Jun&#39;s gaped at it. Kandagawa&#39;s prediction coming true? The phone rang 
several times before Jun picked it up.

&quot;Jun-san?&quot; Akami&#39;s voice flowed over Jun like warm water. She found 
herself smiling into the receiver as the girl talked. &quot;I&#39;m sorry to 
call so soon, I&#39;m sorry to call at all, but I had an idea about dinner 
and wanted to know if you thought...well, if you&#39;d like to come over.&quot; 
Akami&#39;s voice sounded breathy, rushed, as if she was afraid she might 
be cut off before she was done. Or as if she were scared she might not 
be able to get it out at all, Jun supposed.

&quot;I thought you might prefer to come to my place, because then you 
won&#39;t have to clean up and I have all the right tools and you don&#39;t 
have a big kitchen and I don&#39;t want to impose on you.&quot; Jun could hear 
the girl take a deep breath and tried not to laugh audibly.

&quot;That sounds nice.&quot; Jun hoped she kept the smile out of her voice.

&quot;Really? Well, good. Then, could you come over tomorrow, maybe like 
six o&#39;clock or so?&quot;

&quot;Akami,&quot; Jun said suddenly. &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;What? Sure! I mean, I said I&#39;d make you dinner...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Jun interrupted, &quot;not for that. For...bringing me back to life.&quot;

There was silence on the other end of the phone. Jun worried that she 
had scared the girl, but then Akami&#39;s voice came again, and this time 
there was something new in the tone, something deep and full of 
longing and sadness and maturity. &quot;Did I? I&#39;m glad, Jun.&quot;

And suddenly there was nothing more to be said, so they rang off.

Jun sat back down in her chair, and looked with pride around her 
apartment, then thought of tomorrow, for the first time in months - or 
was it years - without dread.

That night, when she slept, she did not dream at all and when she 
awoke, the pillow with burnt edges was on the floor.
