<h1>Afterword (part 7 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../devilman/index.html">Devilman Lady</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../devilman/afterword-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Jun looked down at the directions in her hand and checked the name 
against the plaque on the wall. This was the right place, only...

The front of the restaurant was dark, but a light shone from the back. 
Jun pushed the door open and entered the building. It had once been, 
she noted, a small noodle place. Now the tables and chairs stood in 
varying stages of decay. Equipment had been ripped out of the walls 
and the shelves were denuded. Jun looked up as a light snapped on and 
she heard footsteps on the stairs.

&quot;Jun?&quot; Akami&#39;s voice came from above. &quot;Go through into the kitchen, 
the stairs are on your left. I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t come down, I don&#39;t want 
the asparagus to overcook...come on up.&quot; Her footsteps retreated and 
Jun followed the directions into the ruined kitchen. The stairs were 
there, or at least most of them were. Enough to climb, if one was 
careful. Strange, somewhat unpleasant stains covered the walls and Jun 
kept her hand clutching the flowers in front of her. The hall was 
dingy, but delightful smells wafted down the drafty stairwell and drew 
Jun forward.

The door to Akami&#39;s place stood ajar and Jun could see directly into 
the small apartment. It had been a two-bedroom place, tight for a 
family, but precious in this over-populated city. Someone had pulled 
down the walls at some point, leaving the raw wood of the supports 
exposed. Jun could make out a futon folded into one corner and small 
personal items laid out around the space - but the bulk of the 
apartment was taken up by the kitchen. Or it might be more accurate to 
say that the kitchen had taken over the rest of the apartment. 
Multiple stoves and refrigerators and freezers stood in stiff ranks 
along two walls, and a large, makeshift work island filled the space 
between. An amazing array of pots, pans, woks and utensils covered 
every surface, laid out on racks and shelves all around the strange 
room. What space remained was filled with dried ingredients, spices 
and herbs and jars.

Akami was moving around comfortably, adding a pinch or two of 
something to a pot, slicing garnishes with quick flicks of her wrist 
and laying the food out neatly on chargers.

A small table crouched as far away from the enormous kitchen as 
possible, as if afraid of the large appliances. Jun instantly 
sympathized with it. 

Akami looked up with a smile, &quot;I&#39;m sorry - I got kind of caught up in 
this. It&#39;ll be a few minutes. Would you like something to drink?&quot; She 
gestured towards an overfull rack of wine. &quot;Come on in and pick 
something.&quot;

Jun removed her shoes carefully and entered, swinging past what 
appeared to be a large freezer, as she entered the crowded room. &quot;I 
brought you these,&quot; she said a bit haltingly. &quot;Do you have a vase?&quot;

Akami&#39;s face scrunched up in thought, &quot;I think I have a few in the 
dark cabinet near the second refrigerator - over there.&quot; She waved a 
hand that held a whisk towards one of the appliances. Jun found a vase 
easily - it looked like something a restaurant might have had on a 
table - and arranged the flowers neatly. She placed the vase on the 
low table, then returned to watch the girl move about the kitchen.

&quot;Thank you for the flowers.&quot; Akami&#39;s hair covered her eyes from this 
angle, but Jun could hear the pleasure in her voice. &quot;They&#39;re 
beautiful.&quot; She looked up with a quick smile. &quot;And so are you. I feel 
completely frumpy in comparison,&quot;

Jun waved away the compliment, but inwardly felt warmed by the words. 
&quot;Is all this...stuff...from restaurants?&quot; she asked to draw attention 
away from herself. 

&quot;Yeah. My uncle was an okonomiyaki cook before he...before.&quot; Akami 
poured out a pale yellow sauce into a gravy boat. &quot;Afterwards...after 
Naru was gone and my aunt and uncle, I used what we had in the shop 
downstairs. But things got worse and food was getting hard to find, 
then they started to round people up...&quot; Akami sighed. &quot;Anyway, I had 
decided by then that if I survived I&#39;d become a chef. So I started 
taking stuff from ruined restaurants &#150; sometimes, one piece at a time. 
And now it&#39;s home.&quot; She shrugged, a slightly embarrassed smile on her 
face. &quot;My uncle ripped out the walls when he changed, so I just left 
it.&quot;

She fell silent, then very obviously perked herself up. &quot;So, um, 
dinner is ready, if you&#39;re hungry.&quot;

Jun nodded. &quot;Can I help with anything?&quot;

&quot;Carry this to the table - pick some wine, I&#39;ll be right over.&quot; She 
handed over the gravy boat and turned away to open a refrigerator. &quot;I 
couldn&#39;t find any good meat, so I made a poached salmon. I hope that&#39;s 
alright?&quot;

Jun could hear her stomach grumble and smiled. &quot;It sounds lovely.&quot;

Akami hustled back and forth, placing freshly blanched asparagus on 
the table next to the cold salmon and salad. At last the two women 
settled in for their meal.

It was exquisite and Jun said so - repeatedly.

&quot;I&#39;ve never had anything like this,&quot; Jun said, for the third time. 
&quot;This is simply incredible.&quot;

Akami&#39;s face was flushed with pleasure. &quot;But you were a supermodel,&quot; 
she protested. &quot;You must have eaten at fancy restaurants all the 
time.&quot;

Jun laughed derisively. &quot;A boxed lunch at roughly 3 in the afternoon, 
as part of a 12 hour shoot. Yes, I ate only the best.&quot; Her smile was 
genuine as she continued, &quot;Models aren&#39;t encouraged to eat too much 
anyway. Since...since I stopped modeling, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve gained a lot 
of weight.&quot;

&quot;I think it looks good on you,&quot; Akami protested. &quot;You always looked, I 
don&#39;t know, hungry, before.&quot;

Jun watched the girl in fascination. She had been hungry, in a sense. 
Jun had seen, once, an old picture of her from Kiki, the magazine that 
had made her famous. Her eyes had been enormous and full of longing - 
her face almost sick with need. The picture had made her feel queasy. 
What had people seen in her?

&quot;I was, in a way,&quot; Jun admitted. &quot;I wanted something badly, something 
that I couldn&#39;t have.&quot; She laid her fork on her plate and leaned back. 
&quot;That was so good, I think I might die.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t die before dessert,&quot; Akami said firmly. &quot;I made a 
cheesecake. I had a recipe I wanted to try anyway...&quot; she stood up and 
began to clean off the table. She waved off Jun&#39;s offer of help. 
&quot;Stay, you&#39;re my guest tonight.&quot; She turned away as she spoke, but 
there was a sparkle in Akami&#39;s eyes that made Jun shiver.

Lost in thought, Jun paid only scant attention to the sounds of Akami 
cleaning up the remnants of dinner, of water boiling, of coffee being 
made. Despite her fullness, the bitter aroma of the coffee made her 
mouth water. When Akami returned, Jun looked up.

&quot;I hope you like cheesecake,&quot; Akami said lightly. &quot;If not, don&#39;t tell 
me - I don&#39;t think I could take it,&quot; she joked.

Jun smiled. &quot;I love it - and the coffee smells wonderful, too.&quot; She 
watched Akami walk away and return with two cups full of dark brown 
liquid. &quot;How long have you been cooking like this?&quot;

Akami took a deep breath and looked away into the middle distance. 
&quot;Well, let&#39;s see...I cooked for my aunt and uncle, because by the end 
of the day they were so sick of cooking that they wouldn&#39;t eat if I 
didn&#39;t. I guess, since I was a kid.&quot;

Jun reached out her hand, laying it gently on the other woman&#39;s arm. 
&quot;You have real ability, Akami. Follow your dream and become a chef. I 
know you can do it.&quot; She kept her voice low and gentle and inwardly, 
steeled herself for the girl to flinch away. But Akami only laid a 
hand over Jun&#39;s and squeezed briefly. 

&quot;Thank you. That means a lot to me.&quot; Akami laughed at herself, then. 
&quot;Funny how that is. I just met you yesterday and I feel like you&#39;re 
already a very important person to me.&quot; Her eyes widened as she 
realized what she had said, then that blush crept over her face and 
she pulled away slightly.

Jun could feel the heat in her own face and spoke quickly to lighten 
the tension. &quot;I did an interview today...with Ommi.&quot;

&quot;Really? That&#39;s great!&quot; Akami said, as she laid a huge slice of 
cheesecake on a plate and set it in front of Jun. &quot;Are you going to 
model again?&quot;

Jun stared at the girl. &quot;How could I?&quot; Her voice came out as a harsh 
croak.

Akami looked up quickly, her eyes burning. &quot;Because Jun is beautiful, 
that&#39;s how!&quot; Jun quailed before Akami&#39;s anger. &quot;You&#39;re not horrible, 
Jun - you lost your arms *saving* us! People everywhere think you are 
cool, and important and beautiful. You don&#39;t have the right to hide 
from everyone.&quot; Akami leaned on the table and took a deep breath, 
trying to calm herself down. &quot;We need someone to believe in. We need 
you.&quot;

Jun&#39;s hand shook too hard to pick up cup or fork, so she clenched it 
in her lap and said nothing. 

&quot;I&#39;ll make you a deal,&quot; Akami said, the mischief back in her voice. 
&quot;I&#39;ll keep following my dream to be a chef, if you follow yours.&quot;

Jun hung her head down, thinking over the patent absurdity of the 
statement. She was past her prime - a broken doll...but Akami was 
still young. She had dreams she had to follow and it wasn&#39;t right for 
Jun to keep her from those. &quot;Okay, it&#39;s a deal,&quot; Jun lied with an easy 
smile.

Akami smiled back and seated herself, gesturing at the cake. &quot;Tell me 
what you think.&quot;

Jun picked up the fork, very conscious of crimson eyes upon her. What 
did those eyes remind her of? She sliced off a small piece of the 
cheesecake and put it in her mouth. Its texture was so creamy and 
light, Jun could hear herself moaning with the sheer pleasure of it.

&quot;This is incredible,&quot; she said, and cut herself a second piece. The 
fork had just left her mouth when Akami pressed her lips against 
Jun&#39;s. Her mouth was trapped, slightly open, the confection melting on 
her tongue. Akami&#39;s tongue flicked into Jun&#39;s mouth mingling with the 
cheesecake. Jun&#39;s nostrils were filled with the cinnamon pepper smell 
of the girl, even as her arm convulsively clutched at her.

The kiss went on forever. Jun, having been taken unaware, was 
completely incapable of pulling herself away. Desire exploded in her 
body like a magnesium flare - it was too much to control.

At last Akami pulled away, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand 
like a child and grinning, not at all repentant. &quot;I suppose I should 
say I&#39;m sorry, but...I&#39;m not.&quot; Her grin took on a fierceness, as if 
she was challenging Jun to deny what she felt. &quot;I&#39;ll only be sorry if 
you get up and leave now.&quot; The question was manifest in her gaze, in 
her defiant tone. But Jun didn&#39;t even notice.

Jun put a finger to her mouth, where she could still feel the warmth 
and pressure of Akami&#39;s lips. Her mouth was filled with the taste of 
cheesecake and Akami. Her eyelids drooped, veiling her eyes, then 
opened widely with a sharp jerk. Jun&#39;s nostrils flared and Akami&#39;s 
scent, still on her hand, contained an unmistakable invitation. 

Jun lifted her head and smiled. She could see triumph blaze in Akami&#39;s 
red eyes, along with something else, something animal, something 
primal.

&quot;I&#39;m torn,&quot; Akami said, her voice shaking with emotion, &quot;between 
asking you to finish that cheesecake and demanding that you leave it 
there.&quot;

Before she could stop herself, Jun had reached out and taken the 
girl&#39;s arm in her hand, then pulled her close. Her eyes closed as she 
pressed her lips onto Akami&#39;s, every muscle tense with conflicting 
emotions. 

Jun broke the kiss off sharply. &quot;Akami,&quot; her voice was hoarse, &quot;if you 
want me to leave, say so right now, because I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able 
to in another minute.&quot;

Akami responded by throwing her arms around Jun&#39;s neck and clinging to 
her. &quot;Don&#39;t leave,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Please, don&#39;t leave.&quot;

Jun brushed the chestnut hair away from Akami&#39;s face and stared down 
at the girl. Her body screamed at her, fire racing through her veins, 
but something in her hesitated. Jun ran her hand through Akami&#39;s hair 
again, and then laughed softly. She pushed the red-brown hair back to 
reveal a delicately pointed ear, with a small tuft of fur at the apex. 
Jun stared in fascination.

An embarrassed blush colored the girl&#39;s cheeks. She removed one arm 
from around Jun&#39;s neck and brushed her own fur-tipped ear. &quot;I was born 
with these eyes, but we didn&#39;t know until the Fall about the rest.&quot; 
Akami sat back, her words breathy, her chest rising and falling as she 
sought to cool her own need, as Jun so obviously was controlling her 
own. &quot;I think it&#39;s called a...I think I&#39;m a bush baby.&quot;

Smiling gently, Jun played with the fur on Akami&#39;s ears. She lowered 
her head to rub her lips softly across their surface, allowing her 
breath to blow across the younger woman&#39;s ear. Kissing her way down 
the curve, Jun lingered at the lobe, reaching out lightly with her 
tongue. Akami sighed faintly.

Jun stroked the other woman&#39;s cheek softly with a finger. &quot;When I was 
young, I was very sick &#150; anemic. Whenever I became excited, I would 
pass out.&quot; She placed her lips softly on Akami&#39;s brow. &quot;It made me 
feel horribly different from the other girls. They were not all 
unkind, but I could never feel close to them.&quot;

Akami&#39;s eyes closed. &quot;You&#39;ve always felt alone, haven&#39;t you, Jun?&quot;

Jun nodded, never taking her lips from the soft skin beneath her. Her 
own eyes filled with tears; but she would not cry, not now.

A hand cupped her cheek gently, and Akami moved away to be able to 
look up at her. &quot;You&#39;re not alone now,&quot; she said. Jun watched as 
Akami&#39;s lips moved closer, then brushed softly against her own.

Some part of Jun&#39;s mind was filled with song, a sweet, sad, glorious 
melody that sang of life and death in choral magnificence. This was 
what she had waited her whole life to feel &#150; not just sexual desire, 
not even love - but a sense of completeness, as if the final piece in 
her puzzle had at last been found. 

But she did not really think of that right now &#150; not when her senses 
were filled with the experience of a young, lovely woman in her lap, 
covering her mouth with wet kisses, the smell of sex coming off her in 
waves. Jun clenched her arm around Akami&#39;s slim form and kissed her 
deeply.

Akami felt so good against her that Jun nearly cried out; her skin was 
impossibly soft, her hands everywhere. Jun could feel the patterns 
Akami traced on her skin burn themselves into her memory, sure that 
she would be able to see them in the morning.

They made love on the floor among the monolithic appliances, their 
clothes scattered around the room.

Eventually, they made their way to the small corner where Akami slept. 
Jun was laid out upon the futon, and Akami touched her slowly, 
deliberately, acquainting herself with every inch of the older woman. 
When, at last, she reached her center, Jun cried out, a sound as much 
of triumph as of pleasure.

For Jun, Akami was a revelation. The younger woman had freckles on her 
shoulders, which were impossibly attractive. Jun had to laugh when she 
discovered that the girl was ticklish under the ribs, and very 
sensitive above. The sound Akami made as Jun brushed fingertips over 
nipples made her lips pull back in a feral smile.

And the sensations Akami brought out in her own body made Jun&#39;s head 
spin. Nothing in her life had made her feel this way &#150; she had never 
even imagined that anything could feel like this. For all her tortured 
nights, all her repressed fantasies, this night was her first as lover 
to another woman. Jun nearly crowed with joy.

The night stretched out before them, and their lovemaking settled down 
from frantic need into a slow luxuriating in each other&#39;s bodies that 
took them into the small hours. At last, they fell asleep on the small 
futon, Akami curled into the crook of Jun&#39;s arm.

 

Jun awoke with a sensation that took her a long time to place. She 
could feel Akami&#39;s body pressed against her own, curled up as she 
slept. Her mouth and nose were filled with that familiar cinnamon 
pepper scent and with a start, Jun realized that what she felt was 
contentment. Something she had been without for so long, she had 
completely forgotten what it felt like. She wondered, then, if she had 
ever felt it at all.

She sat up carefully, making sure she did not disturb the younger 
woman. The night was dark and clear, with no moon. Jun pulled back the 
curtain to stare out at the night world. She could hear small 
creatures moving in the alleyway behind Akami&#39;s building, and smell 
liquor and human sweat. Nonetheless, she stood naked in front of the 
window.

It was then that Jun realized that she hadn&#39;t thought of Kazumi &#150; or 
Asuka &#150; in hours. Just Akami: Akami&#39;s hair, her eyes, her hands, her 
taste and scent and the feel of her inside and out. Jun&#39;s eyes closed 
and she sighed, reliving the sensations. She smiled and opened her 
eyes. It was hard to believe that this was actually the first time 
that Jun had made love with another woman. It was as if all the 
torment she had lived through, all the tension, and unfulfilled need, 
all of Asuka&#39;s raw sexuality, and Kazumi&#39;s innocent love had never 
been. Jun let the curtain fall, and bowed her head. She couldn&#39;t bring 
herself to ask Kazumi for forgiveness &#150; she knew the girl well enough 
to know that Kazumi would only have gotten angry at the request.

*Kazumi &#150; may your spirit rest in peace...and love,* she prayed 
silently, but with fervor. *Thank you.*

&quot;Jun?&quot; Akami&#39;s voice was rough with sleep and Jun could feel her 
nipples harden with excitement at the sound. She turned to face the 
younger woman.

Akami sat on the futon, her eyes droopy. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;

Jun smiled softly. &quot;I&#39;m fine. Did I wake you?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Akami shook her head and rubbed her eyes. Jun thought it a 
charming gesture. &quot;What are you doing?&quot;

Jun held out her hand towards the younger woman. &quot;I want to take you 
somewhere. Will you come with me? Do you trust me?&quot;

Akami stood abruptly in answer, her naked body gleaming palely. Jun&#39;s 
nostrils widened as she approached. This girl made her every sense 
tingle and it felt so good Jun could barely keep it contained.

Jun gathered the younger woman in her arm and squeezed her close. 
&quot;Hold on tightly.&quot; Jun whispered and, with a single silent invocation, 
let herself go. *Asuka,* she thought, *thank you, you damnable bitch, 
thank you for this moment.*

Her hair gathered itself together and drew up, shaping wings on her 
head. Muscles filled out her arms and legs, and as she smiled down at 
Akami, fangs gleamed. &quot;Do you trust me?&quot; she repeated, her voice 
lower, gruffer.

Akami&#39;s only answer was to link her arms around Jun&#39;s powerful neck.

Jun slid the window open and carried Akami onto the balcony. With the 
slightest grunt of effort, Jun manifested her wings and leapt out into 
the night sky.

Wind filled Jun&#39;s ears, and she was aware only of the movement of air 
across her skin, and the little, warm, lithe body against her.

She flew over her city, around the Tower that still stood despite 
everything, and around the bay. They passed over the area where Jun&#39;s 
apartment building stood, and her modeling agency had been. They flew 
over great gouges in the ground where buildings were being rebuilt, or 
had been completely destroyed. With each new reminder of the 
destruction of her city, Jun relived the horror of it all, but as each 
sight passed away behind her, she could feel the burden lessen.

The night was passing, and the sky was grey with impending dawn when 
Jun landed once again. She let go of Akami with a kiss, laughing as 
the girl purred slightly and ran her tongue over a fang. 

Jun looked down into red eyes. Akami smiled up at her. Jun could see 
the tiniest tip of a sharp incisor and caught it on a fingertip. 

&quot;Jun,&quot; Akami whispered, as she held Jun&#39;s hand to her face. &quot;Let&#39;s go 
inside.&quot;

Jun shook her head. &quot;I want to stay here and watch the sun rise.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Akami looked at the ground, trying to avoid Jun&#39;s eyes. 

&quot;I want you to see me &#150; the true me.&quot; Jun held Akami tightly, pulling 
her closer. &quot;Or, are you afraid of me?&quot;

Akami eyes blazed as she met Jun&#39;s gaze. &quot;I think you are the most 
beautiful thing I&#39;ve ever seen,&quot; she said fiercely, and the incisors 
were gone this time. But Jun willed herself to maintain this form, as 
the sun broke over the horizon. As the light stained the buildings 
around them in shades of rust, Jun stood firmly in the rays of the 
rising sun. She looked down at her body, the muscular physique, so 
unfeminine, the fur, the claws. With determination, she watched as, 
for the first time, this form saw the light of day...and the light of 
day saw her.

With some hesitation, Jun turned to look at Akami, hoping that the 
girl wasn&#39;t too embarrassed to be seen with her. Red eyes were 
watching her closely, with something more than just attention. 

&quot;Let&#39;s go inside,&quot; Akami said again, and this time, there was more in 
the sentence, a huskiness which made Jun growl low in her throat in 
answer.

They stepped back into the gloom of the apartment, and found each 
other once again, lips meeting lips, and tongues touching. It wasn&#39;t 
until many hours later that Jun realized that she hadn&#39;t shifted out 
of her Devilman form once. Akami looked up at her, nose quivering, 
skin twitching and Jun noticed with no special surprise that the girl 
had a light fur coat over her whole body.

&quot;You&#39;re beautiful,&quot; she said, so matter-of-factly that Akami laughed 
out loud. And hearing that laugh, so natural, so normal, so happy, Jun 
smiled.
