<h1>Afterword (part 2 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../devilman/index.html">Devilman Lady</a>

<a href="../devilman/afterword-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The door closed behind Jun, loud in the silent apartment. She shrugged 
her coat off one shoulder, then remembered with some embarrassment 
that she could hang it up herself. By her own request, no aide would 
be there tonight. No one to bathe her. No one to pick up clothes. For 
the first time in months, Jun was completely alone. 

And she was glad for that in ways she would have been hard put to 
describe. Once upon a time, her apartment had been her refuge. When 
the world had been too much for her she had been able to come back and 
revel in the silence, the emptiness that matched the emptiness inside. 

Then Kazumi had joined her and she had wanted, desperately wanted, to 
come home to the girl, to her cheerful voice and her stories. But 
something always dragged her away.

No, not something - someone. Asuka knew, had always known, long before 
Jun had ever admitted it to herself, what Jun felt for Kazumi. That 
evil child, the Devilbeast boy had known, too - they all had known. 
Even Kazumi had known. Everyone but Jun herself. 

Jun stripped her clothes off carefully. First a bath. No, a shower. No 
more soaking in a tub like a child. She would wash herself and then 
sleep.

The water was hot. It felt so good that Jun sighed out loud - which 
felt good in its own right. So she sighed again. With each sigh, a 
weight lifted from her, and she felt lighter. Soap, shampoo, loofah; 
everything made her feel good. It was the best she had felt in so long 
she was suddenly afraid to turn the shower off. What if the feeling 
swirled away down the drain with the water?

She wrapped a towel around herself somewhat awkwardly, smiling wryly 
at her misty reflection in the mirror. So, she didn&#39;t have the hang of 
it yet. That was alright. It would come with time.

The doctors at the Institute had offered to replace both arms, but she 
had refused. One was enough. They couldn&#39;t understand that the ragged, 
ugly wound on her shoulder was all she had left of Asuka. She couldn&#39;t 
bear to lose it. As much as she hated and feared the woman, she owed 
her everything. Without Asuka to create her, Jun wouldn&#39;t have been 
born.

&quot;Goddamn you, Asuka Ran.&quot; Jun whispered to the ether. &quot;I hope your 
hell is even more horrible than mine.&quot;

Jun leaned heavily against her hand, thinking of the hell she had 
ruled, if only for a few hours. She had reigned in hell, while Asuka 
had reigned in heaven. Her eyes closed and her skin crawled with the 
memory of Kazumi, dear, sweet Kazumi, reduced to a grotesque part of 
that horrific vision of mutated humanity. Kazumi, whose last request 
was that Jun wouldn&#39;t turn around and see her...

Jun stripped the towel from her body and stumbled back into the 
shower, sucking in steam, trying not to vomit, burning her skin with 
water too hot to tolerate. She scrubbed her body until it began to 
bleed. 

She had reigned in hell.

The fit passed, as it always did. For the second time, Jun shut off 
the water, but left the towel on the floor. Naked, she lurched 
drunkenly into her bedroom. The nurse&#39;s cot was still there - a 
testament to her second infancy. In disgust, she dragged it to one 
side of the room, as far from the bed as possible. She threw herself 
down on her bed with vehemence.

The bed rose up to meet her, soft blankets and plush mattress soothing 
her. She pushed her face into a worn pillow with burn marks on the 
edge and breathed in. The faint scent was barely detectable. Her 
nostrils widened to take it in, cinnamon and pepper.

She rolled onto her back, spreading her limbs across the large bed 
that she had never shared with Kazumi. Instead she had run from the 
girl and, not trusting herself, had bought bunk beds. She wondered, 
not for the first time, what would have become of them if she had 
bought a double bed like Kazumi wanted. Would they have had nights of 
passion or would she have laid there, trembling with desire, not 
saying a word, not moving? 

Jun smiled horribly up at the ceiling. Would it have been so bad? Jun 
couldn&#39;t stop the tears from coming, she never could. At least this 
time she could wipe them away herself, and not have to bear the 
consoling voice of the nurse, who thought she was in pain. Well, she 
was, but it was nothing she would share with the woman.

Jun ran an angry arm across her eyes, then did it again, because it 
felt impossibly good to be able to do it. She draped her forearm 
across her face, then ran her fingers through her hair. It was coarser 
than she remembered - but then, it had been months since she had had 
it done professionally, or even with anything other than institutional 
soap. She decided firmly to make an appointment with a salon. She took 
a long look at her hand and grimaced. As soon as her nails grew a 
little longer.

She let her hand move slowly down her face, feeling eyelids and ears 
carefully. You take them for granted, she thought, but they feel 
different on each person. Skin, like scent, is unique for everyone. 

Her cheeks were warm, her mouth wet, her teeth hard. Her chin was weak 
&#150; it had always been, but feeling the bone beneath the skin was 
reassuring.

Carefully she moved her hand to her wounded shoulder. The scar was 
healed long ago, but there would always be a sensitivity that was as 
much emotional as physical. She ran her fingers along the uneven skin, 
a little nauseated at the sensation. This is where tendon and muscle 
had shredded, then parted. This is where bone had been broken away. 

Her hand moved off her shoulder and across her collarbone, with its 
soothing solidity. Then down to her chest. The skin of her breasts was 
softer than she remembered, but looser too. Age, stress, lack of 
exercise, they were all taking a toll on her body.

As her hand passed across her nipple, a sharp sensation traveled 
through her body, followed by a terrible realization. It had 
been...how long...since she had had sex? Long enough ago that she 
couldn&#39;t remember. Before Asuka had come into her life, before Kazumi, 
before becoming a Devilman. And all those months of heightened 
awareness, of hormones and raging animal instincts and being 
surrounded by women she wanted more than she wanted food.

Her hand passed along the outer edge of her aureole; the feeling of 
need that she had suppressed for so long intensified quickly. She 
squeezed her nipple, enjoying the sensation of the heat between her 
legs.

Jun gasped out loud as she rolled the nipple between her fingers. It 
wasn&#39;t a question of lust and there wasn&#39;t any way to put it off - 
this was pure physical exigency. She didn&#39;t bother with preliminaries; 
she needed to come, and quickly. Lowering her hand, she parted her 
lower lips, only vaguely aware of their softness, of the hair that 
surrounded them, but very aware of her own smell, and the feeling of 
the blood coursing through her body, singing along her spine. It had 
been too long - longer than anyone should have to go without this.

Her spine arced against the bed as she touched herself. Need and 
desire sped through her entire body as her new fingers passed back and 
forth across her center. For a brief, amused moment, Jun wished for a 
second hand, but then her climax was upon her and she couldn&#39;t think 
of anything else as her muscles bunched beneath her. Her gasping was 
loud in her ears, but she was too caught up to be embarrassed. Her 
orgasm was long, but not long enough, not enough to fill the emptiness 
she knew she&#39;d have to face now. 

Now that she was alone. Now that she had no reason not have a life 
again.

She relaxed back on the bed, breathing heavily, her body covered in a 
sheen of sweat. It was good, but it wouldn&#39;t be enough. Jun knew that 
after a few days, or a few weeks, she&#39;d have to give in, to prowl dark 
bars until she found someone who would give her the release she 
couldn&#39;t live without. 

Her own need scared her. She remembered how, as a high school student, 
she had run away from Aoi, who had so clearly desired her. She had run 
to a nameless place, a bar full of bitter, self-involved people, 
desperately trying to forget things. And she had thrown herself into 
the arms of a man she couldn&#39;t remember, whose name she had never 
learned. Lost her virginity in a drunken stupor, all to save herself 
from being kissed by a woman who wanted her so much. It had terrified 
her more that Aoi had been able to understand. She hadn&#39;t wanted to 
admit the truth &#150; the truth about herself that had been so obvious to 
Asuka.

And then there were the months before...before the Fall. Jun had been 
driven mad by her attraction to Asuka, and to Kazumi. Asuka scared 
her, but not as much as her longing for Kazumi had. Months of living 
with and working near, women she wanted so badly her body would shake 
with longing...

Jun let her fingers play in her own wetness, remembering the feel of 
Kazumi&#39;s body the day they had finally allowed themselves to admit 
their love. She could feel her muscles tighten again, remembering the 
sound of the girl&#39;s voice, the scent of her skin, and the smell of her 
lust. Jun came a second time, imagining the taste of Kazumi&#39;s lips.

Jun slept deeply that night, as she hadn&#39;t slept for months.
