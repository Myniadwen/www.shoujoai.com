<h1>Afterword (part 3 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../devilman/index.html">Devilman Lady</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../devilman/afterword-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>There was a knock on the door - a soft, tentative knock. Jun drew a 
robe over her pajamas and left her tea on the counter. She walked over 
to the door. There was a time when she would have hesitated, worried. 
There was a time when she had lived in fear.

&quot;Hello?&quot; she called out.

There was a movement outside the door and a sharp noise, followed by a 
cry of pain. Jun wrenched the door open to see what was happening and 
was amazed to see the girl from the caf&eacute; the day before. Akami was 
holding her foot in one hand and bouncing in place, a grimace of 
embarrassment and discomfort distorting her young face. It was obvious 
that she had stubbed her toe against the doorjamb; Jun suppressed a 
grin.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry!&#39; she gasped and gingerly placed her foot on the ground. 
Jun watched in amusement as she limped in place. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to 
disturb you!&quot;

Jun couldn&#39;t help it - she laughed out loud. &quot;That&#39;s what you said 
yesterday, too.&quot;

Akami blushed angrily. &quot;I was just...I was nearby and I thought...&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you come in?&quot; Jun didn&#39;t disguise her entertainment at the 
girl&#39;s antics.

Akami limped in behind Jun and stood uncertainly inside the apartment. 
&quot;What a beautiful place,&quot; the girl said politely. Jun knew it was a 
lie - the apartment looked dumpy and worn.

&quot;Would you like some tea?&quot; Jun gestured towards the kitchen. &quot;I was 
just about to have some.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, that would be lovely.&quot; Akami stepped in, her head 
swiveling back and forth as she took in the decorations, the 
knickknacks...the scattered memories of an interrupted life.

Jun waited until they were both seated at the low table, tea and 
snacks in front of them, before she inquired, &quot;So, what brought you 
here today, Akami-san?&quot; Her eyes lingered on the girl&#39;s face, her 
manner bolder that the previous day. There was no reason to run from 
herself any more. There was no reason to hide what she was from this 
girl.

&quot;I...was in the area, and...&quot;

Jun smiled tightly, &quot;So you said.&quot; She wouldn&#39;t help. She wouldn&#39;t 
easily acquiesce to another&#39;s commands ever again.

Akami&#39;s face turned that angry red once again, and she looked away. 
After a moment the girl&#39;s eyes widened, and her lips parted in a 
slight intake of breath. Jun turned her head to see what had elicited 
the reaction, and found that Akami was looking at a framed photo.

Jun stood up and lifted it gently off the shelf. She dusted it with 
her sleeve, then turned back and handed it to the other woman.

Akami stared down. &quot;This is who you thought I was at first?&quot;

Jun nodded, sipping her tea. The photo had been taken by a friend, a 
photographer, at the height of her modeling career. She and Kazumi, 
back-to-back, smiling, pretending to be on a shoot together. Jun 
looked away until the tears that threatened had receded.

&quot;She&#39;s cute.&quot; Akami&#39;s voice was ironic. 

&quot;Yes, she was.&quot; Jun answered. 

&quot;Oh. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Akami laid the photo down gently. She seemed about to 
say something, but thought better of it. After a sip of her tea, her 
jaw set and she said, &quot;I came by because I wanted to see you again.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Jun couldn&#39;t keep her voice cool; it was impossible with 
this girl. She had too much energy, too much possibility in her. &quot;I&#39;m 
glad.&quot;

The blush returned to Akami&#39;s face. Not angry this time, or 
embarrassed. Jun could smell the excitement coming off the girl&#39;s skin 
and could feel her own body react to it.

&quot;I wanted to know more about you,&quot; Akami admitted, looking away. &quot;You 
don&#39;t seem...well...I don&#39;t know. I thought you&#39;d be more swaggering, 
or powerful, more confident. But you seem like a regular person. You 
seem so gentle.&quot;

Jun stood abruptly and walked away, taking the teapot with her. 

Akami leapt to her feet, hand over her mouth. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean that! I 
meant...&quot;

Jun turned back quickly, her hair whipping across angry eyes. &quot;You 
meant that I don&#39;t seem like a monster?&quot;

Akami stepped back in the face of the older woman&#39;s quiet fury. &quot;No! I 
mean yes! I mean,&quot; she took a shuddering breath and willed herself 
calm, &quot;I mean that Jun-san seems like a nice person.&quot;

Jun turned away, but now her voice *was* cold. &quot;I&#39;m not, though. I&#39;m 
not nice at all.&quot; It hurt her to hurt the girl, but this was like 
every day she had lived through her whole life. People kept seeing in 
her things they wanted to see, not what was truly there.

&quot;Please, Jun-san, I didn&#39;t mean to offend you, I just wanted...&quot;

Jun turned around, a nasty smile on her face. &quot;You wanted to what? To 
be in the presence of the woman who was a Devilman? Or was it the 
supermodel who you thought was cool?&quot;

Akami looked at her feet while Jun spoke. Her body shook, but she 
didn&#39;t answer. 

&quot;You wanted what everyone always wanted from me &#150; to bask a little in 
reflected glory, to use me, then cast me aside, to...&quot; Jun choked on 
her words, vaguely aware that she was crying now. &quot;To take from what 
would best suit you &#150; a little fame, a story to tell your friends, 
maybe even, what, sex? Do you want that &#150; to be able to say that you 
slept with Fudou Jun? Or maybe the Devilman Lady herself?&quot;

Jun leaned on the counter, suddenly exhausted. &quot;I can&#39;t be that for 
you, Akami-san. I am consumed...my entire existence is consumed with 
the energy it takes just to be me.&quot;

When Jun stopped speaking, she glared at the girl who was not Kazumi 
and waited for her to bolt.

But Akami hadn&#39;t moved. She shook where she stood, her hands clasped 
tightly in front of her. Jun watched with annoyance, then surprise as 
she realized that girl was laughing. 

Akami lifted her eyes and her smile was so genuinely delighted that 
Jun&#39;s own mouth began to quirk, despite her irritation, despite her 
tears, despite her self-pity.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I really am. What a horrible fool I&#39;ve made of myself!&quot; 
Akami&#39;s laughter abated, and she wiped at her face. &quot;You&#39;re right &#150; I 
was being selfish. I wasn&#39;t thinking clearly at all. Can you forgive 
me?&quot;

Jun ducked her head and turned away to reheat the water. Why hadn&#39;t 
Akami run? Why wasn&#39;t she scared? What did she want?

&quot;I was just star-struck, I guess,&quot; Akami continued. &quot;I knew about 
Devilman Lady and I forgot, I guess, how much it cost you to be that.&quot; 
The girl turned her head towards the photo on the table. &quot;You lost her 
in the Fall, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

Jun made a non-committal noise. 

&quot;I lost my lover too.&quot;

Jun&#39;s head whipped up at the so-casual admission. Akami hadn&#39;t turned 
back, but spoke looking over her shoulder. &quot;She wasn&#39;t like you - she 
was dark and soft, like nighttime. They took her away in the first 
roundup.&quot;

Jun&#39;s hand clenched into a fist. 

&quot;She was like, like...a wolf. The first time she changed, we were both 
so frightened. And then the army came and we were separated and I 
never saw her again. I tried to find her - I prayed that she had 
survived, but...&quot; she turned back to Jun, unanswerable questions in 
her eyes.

Jun let the silence lengthen until it was unbearable. What could she 
say to comfort the girl? That God hadn&#39;t been listening, because she 
had been preoccupied with causing it all in the first place?

&quot;Kazumi,&quot; she grated out the name, &quot;didn&#39;t change until almost the 
very end.&quot;

&quot;But you saved the world for her, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

Jun nodded. Akami took a few steps towards the older woman. 

&quot;I guess you don&#146;t realize, because no one ever told you before, but 
you&#39;re not the only one like you.&quot; Akami&#39;s voice was gentle, as if Jun 
was the child here. &quot;You&#39;re not the only woman to want a 
woman...you&#39;re not the only one to have lost everything in the 
Fall...you&#39;re just the woman that saved us all.&quot;

Jun laughed despite herself. &quot;That&#39;s all?&quot;

Akami smiled bitterly. &quot;No, but you&#39;re not alone.&quot;


Jun grabbed the boiling water off the flame and refilled the pot. 
Gesturing towards the table, she walked past the girl and seated 
herself.

&quot;You think you understand,&quot; Jun said quietly. &quot;And I appreciate that. 
But you don&#39;t. You can&#39;t.&quot; She didn&#39;t say, &quot;You can never understand 
what Asuka did to me.&quot;

Akami put a hand out and gripped Jun&#39;s robe. &quot;That woman, that woman 
who became the angelic creature, what did she do to you?&quot;

Jun stared at the girl. Could she read minds? &quot;She made me.&quot;

Akami didn&#39;t blink. &quot;She was the cause of everything &#150; we know that 
now. She made us all. What did she do to *you* that she didn&#39;t do to 
the rest of us?&quot; The girl&#39;s tone was sharper, more pitiless, perhaps, 
than she intended. 

Jun looked at her hand, which was clenched around her refilled cup. 
&quot;She did it all for me. So I could rule over hell for her.&quot; Jun looked 
up and met Akami&#39;s eyes. 

Akami let go of Jun&#39;s sleeve and covered her mouth with her hand.

Jun looked hard at Akami and let her have it. *You want to know what 
she did? Well, I&#39;ll tell you, little-girl-who-is-not-Kazumi.* It was 
her turn to speak without pity.

&quot;She made me her dog. She made me kill the first woman who had ever 
loved me, and all the women who had loved me since. I killed a 
businessman who had been fired and was desperate for his family. I 
killed innocent people by not being around to save them. Three men 
died because they believed that they loved me. Kazumi died because she 
did love me &#150; all because Asuka wanted me to reign over hell for her, 
so she could be the queen of heaven.&quot; And she let Akami see the horror 
of it all in her eyes. 

&quot;Oh god.&quot; Akami&#39;s broken voice was a mere whisper.

&quot;You think,&quot; Jun continued remorselessly, &quot;you thought I was cool, 
because you didn&#39;t understand what I was. I wasn&#39;t just another beast. 
I was human &#150; all that time. I knew what pain felt like, what killing 
smelled like, what the cries of mourning sounded like. My body was 
strong, but my will was so weak, I couldn&#39;t stop. Night after night I 
came to Asuka&#39;s whistle. I had to kill her to free myself.&quot;

Jun closed her eyes. *There, now you know. Your adolescent fantasies 
blown away by the truth of a weak, ugly, horrible life.*

Jun didn&#39;t move when Akami&#39;s arms encircled her. Or when the younger 
woman stroked her hair. It wasn&#39;t until she said, &quot;My poor Jun,&quot; that 
the last wall of resistance cracked and she laid her head on Akami&#39;s 
chest and cried.

&quot;How alone you&#39;ve been,&quot; Akami whispered into her hair. &quot;And no one 
knew &#150; we all thought you were a hero.&quot;

Jun kept crying until the tears simply stopped coming and the shaking 
was over and all that was left was a horrible rawness, and that 
cinnamon-pepper scent in her nostrils. Jun fell asleep a moment later, 
carried away by a fatigue she hadn&#39;t known she felt.

Akami let her sleep for a little while, then lowered the other woman&#39;s 
form to the ground. She left silently a moment later.
