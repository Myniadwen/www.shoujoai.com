<a href="../devilman/afterword-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Jun rarely had nightmares. Her waking life had been so horrible, so 
unspeakable, for so long; there was nothing her unconscious mind could 
have thrown at her that could have been worse.

This time she dreamt of the Progress, something she hadn&#39;t dreamed of 
in a long while. Her dreams were usually haunted by the faces of the 
people she had killed, not by her own horror. In the dream, her body 
once again became that of the Devilman; naked, muscular, with stripes 
of fur on her torso, arms and legs. Her tongue felt sharp against her 
teeth and she smiled at the scent of blood on her hands.

Her eyes had been open for some time before she realized she was 
awake. She was staring at the legs of the table in her living room 
and, for a moment, she was completely disconcerted. Then she 
remembered how she had come to be here. 

She looked around, willing her stinging eyes to focus, and was 
surprised to find that the light in the kitchen was on, although the 
rest of the apartment was dark.

Jun lifted herself up, taking in the open bag, the ingredients spread 
over the kitchen counter. She rubbed her eyes. Slowly, she also became 
aware of a soft noise that she could barely hear &#150; a noise that had 
punctuated her dreams. A pleasant voice was humming quietly.

Akami looked up from the cutting board. &quot;Did my humming wake you?&quot; 

Jun shook her head, bewildered. &quot;I don&#39;t think so. How long have 
I...?&quot;

Akami turned away, stirring something in a pot. &quot;A few hours, I guess. 
I had to go out and buy some food and came back a little while ago. 
You don&#39;t keep much in the apartment, do you?&quot; She shot an easy smile 
over her shoulder, which Jun returned unsurely.

&quot;I haven&#39;t had much occasion to cook recently,&quot; Jun&#39;s voice was 
gentle, but the girl responded by flinching. 

She laid the knife down and lowered her head.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Jun-san. I keep forgetting.&quot;

Jun struggled to her feet. &quot;It&#39;s alright. I do too. It seems too 
unreal to have happened anyway.&quot;

Akami nodded and returned to the meal. As the fragrance of sauce and 
meat and vegetables reached her, Jun realized just how hungry she was. 
As if in confirmation, her stomach growled audibly.

Akami laughed. &quot;This will be ready any second. Why don&#39;t you sit down? 
If you want some wine - I bought a bottle.&quot; She gestured at the table.

Jun wondered how she would open the thing, but it stood all ready to 
pour. She filled two glasses with the ruby liquid and seated herself 
at one of the set places. All this and she had slept through it.

&quot;You must have been silent as a mouse,&quot; Jun said, as Akami approached, 
bearing two plates, heavy with food.

&quot;Not really &#150; you were sleeping very deeply. You didn&#39;t even move when 
I dropped one of the bags.&quot; The girl looked at her hard, her eyes 
glinting with questions.

&quot;I didn&#39;t realize how tired I was,&quot; Jun shrugged, unwilling to delve 
into the deeper reasons for her exhaustion. Maybe it was as simple as 
fatigue from using her arm for a full day. Jun lifted a forkful of 
vegetables to her mouth and breathed in the aroma. &quot;It smells 
delicious. Thank you.&quot;

Akami said nothing, but her eyes sparkled with pleasure. 

Dinner tasted wonderful. Jun had forgotten that eating could be so 
satisfying, that all five senses could be engaged with such a simple 
act. She ate with concentration, not wanting to distract herself with 
speech, and Akami followed her lead.

When plates and leftovers had been cleaned up, they returned to the 
table and sat over their wine.

Jun was content to sit in silence. She had always been a quiet, 
private person. Her short sojourn with Kazumi hadn&#146;t changed that &#150; 
perhaps it had even intensified it, as she had found herself with so 
much to hide from the girl. But she knew that silence placed pressure 
on other people, so she glanced up and addressed Akami. The younger 
woman was apparently lost in thought and Jun had to repeat herself 
before she came out of her reverie.

&quot;Tell me about yourself, Akami-san.&quot;

Akami&#146;s face changed color quickly; that self-deprecatory flush that 
gave her away. &quot;There&#146;s not much to say, really. I&#146;m no one special.&quot; 
She shrugged.

&quot;Everyone is someone special,&quot; Jun said warmly. &quot;Please.&quot; All of a 
sudden she was desperate to learn more about this girl &#150; to make her a 
separate person from the ghost likeness she wore too well.

Akami shrugged again and shifted in her seat. &quot;I was in college when 
the Fall happened. I was majoring in,&quot; she grimaced, &quot;economics. I 
didn&#146;t know what I was going to do with it, you understand, but my 
guardians insisted on something in business.&quot;

Jun smiled, encouragingly. &quot;My parents let me come to Tokyo and be a 
model because they thought I&#146;d fail at it and come home soon.&quot;

Akami looked at her in some surprise. &quot;Really? But how did they feel 
when you succeeded?&quot;

Jun shrugged. &quot;We never talked about it. They never said what they 
thought and I never asked.&quot;

&quot;Did they...are they alive?&quot; Akami settled on the least painful 
version of the question she could find.

&quot;No.&quot; June shook her head. &quot;But they have been gone for a while.&quot; 
Thank the gods for that little blessing; they were never alive to see 
the final humiliation of their only child become a beast, fighting at 
another&#146;s command. Jun flinched internally. What was modeling, though, 
other than performing at another&#146;s command? She began to understand, a 
little, why her parents hadn&#146;t really wanted her to succeed.

&quot;I don&#146;t remember my parents,&quot; Akami said. &quot;My aunt and uncle brought 
me up, and gave me enough money to go to college. But my uncle changed 
when I was at school one day and I came home to&#133;to&#133;&quot; her face was pale 
and her eyes closed. 

Jun was reminded, yet again, that hers was not the only loss. She cut 
in quickly. &quot;At the beginning, when I was still new to being the 
Devilman, I had to fight the beast that killed my friend&#146;s parents.&quot; 
She didn&#146;t say, &quot;in front of her &#150; while she watched.&quot;

&quot;I bet she was grateful that you saved her life.&quot; Akami said, 
generously.

Jun didn&#146;t respond. &quot;So,&quot; she forced herself to smile, &quot;you know all 
about me&#133;tell me your likes and dislikes, your dreams&#133;you know, all 
that interview stuff.&quot;

Akami grinned back. &quot;Well, my favorite color is red.&quot; She gestured at 
her eyes. &quot;If it weren&#146;t, I&#146;d walk around all the time clashing with 
myself. My favorite food is&#133;hmmm&#133;chocolate, I guess. I like nighttime 
better than day and I want to be a chef.&quot; She turned shy eyes to Jun. 
&quot;I&#146;m in cooking school now.&quot;

Jun raised her half-empty glass. &quot;I have every confidence that you&#146;ll 
do well as a chef. Dinner tonight was the best I&#146;ve had in a very long 
time.&quot; Her own voice was rich and low and it surprised her. Maybe 
she&#146;d had too much wine, but it felt good, drinking, eating, in the 
company of this young woman. 

&quot;It wasn&#146;t very good,&quot; the girl demurred politely, but then the 
mischief returned to her eyes. &quot;If you want, Jun-san, I can come back 
and make you a real meal. Something special!&quot; Her voice and body were 
animated with the idea. &quot;Maybe a homemade dessert&#133;and something fancy, 
like a carpaccio&#133;&quot; 

Jun watch with pleasure as Akami took her acquiescence for granted. 
Why wasn&#146;t she fighting back, insisting on her right to choose her own 
path? What happened to her resolve not to do another&#39;s bidding? 

How had this girl insinuated herself so thoroughly into Jun&#146;s life, so 
quickly?

It was very late when Akami finally left. Jun had insisted on calling 
a cab for the girl. There was no point in letting her walk home alone. 
The streets were safe from monsters of one kind &#150; but there would 
always be monsters hidden in the dark places of the world.

Jun lay in bed, questions pounding in her head like drumbeats. But the 
one question, the one that gave her a horrible anticipatory shudder, 
and more than once caused her to lick her lips without realizing it, 
was this: did Akami ever change? What animal lay behind those gleaming 
red eyes?

As she lay there listening to the sounds of night, Jun whispered, &quot;I 
have to know.&quot; Which made her wonder why.
