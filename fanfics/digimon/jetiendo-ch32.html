<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../digimon/jetiendo-ch31.html">Back to Part 31</a><pre>Misty and Kari laid peacefully on the bed, eyes glaring at each other in 
happiness

&quot; So what was your ex- boyfriend like?&quot; Kari asked

&quot;Well&quot; Misty started &quot; he was a year and a half younger than me,&quot;

&quot; You are so lucky in love&quot; Kari replied &quot; getting a boyfriend younger 
than you&quot;

&quot; He&#39;s very serious, we always lost our tempers&quot;

&quot;How long have you known him?&quot;

&quot; I&#39;ve known him since he was 10, he&#39;d been 14 yesterday,&quot;

Kari seemed to have a good idea who her ex was.

&quot; How long where you together for?&quot;

&quot; Well &quot; Misty admitted, &quot;I&#39;ll pass on that one&quot;

&quot; Why did you two split up?&quot; Kari asked

&quot; Well, we had another quarrel, and we ended it, we could have got back 
together like usual. But my sisters where going on vacation, I had to 
run the gym. He left met up with this girl with her brother, then they 
left. I finally knew how he felt about me. I&#39;ve met him a few times 
since then.&quot;

&quot;Have you ever.... Shit that&#39;s inappropriate&quot;

&quot; What Kari&quot;?

&quot; Have you ever. I. ...Mean h-h-have s-s-s-s-sex?&quot;

Misty&#39;s face turned red. Took a huge breath

&quot;Yes&quot; she panted. &quot; I did, got pregnant too.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re joking,&quot; Kari gasped, &quot; what happened to the baby?&quot;

Misty started to cry &quot; miscarriage&quot;

&quot;Sorry&quot;

&quot; I was running the gym, I knew I was pregnant but I never told anyone, 
only my doctor knew, I fainted, I was in hospital, agonizing pains then 
they told me I had a miscarriage, I suffered alone, I had too move on I 
still thought of the baby every step of the way. I couldn&#39;t tell him, 
he&#39;d known it would only lead to one thing. Another fucking argument!&quot;

Misty broke down &quot; I shot him on the leg, watching his new girlfriend 
save him, I cried when I spied on him&quot;

Kari&#39;s phone went off, Kari answered it, and TK was on the phone

&quot;Kari, where are you&quot; the phone asked

&quot; Rosette hotel&quot; Kari answered, &quot; I spent the night there with Misty,&quot;

&quot; I gotta tell ya this Ash and May are engaged,&quot; TK said

&quot; Really,&quot; Kari replied &quot; anyway, I&#39;m running out of credit, I gotta go, 
I&#39;ll come back as soon as I&#39;m ready bye&quot; she hung up, Kari went back too 
Misty

&quot;Ash proposed to May&quot;

Misty&#39;s face turned sadder, &quot; Ash...engaged&quot;

&quot; Ash, he&#39;s your ex&quot; Kari shouted out

&quot;You can read my mind&quot;

Meanwhile Ash and May sat in their room; Max was allowed to live there 
now. They hadn&#39;t seen Brock ages every body got worried. Might as well 
forget him, lately Rage has been acting really weirdly since he and May 
got engaged, he tough by nature but never this tough but it was kinda 
like he was jealous of his own son. Henry Lilac known as King Rage was 
letting all his anger out on his own son, Ash Ketchum,

Ash did not want to turn up at dinner; he just wanted to get back on 
track on his life, not being locked up in this castle.

&quot;Ash&quot; May said &quot;are we going to breakfast today.&quot;

&quot;You can go&quot; Ash groaned &quot;I&#39;m not&quot; Ash stayed on his bed, unhappy. &quot; I 
hate my dad May I can&#39;t speak to him eye to eye&quot;

Ash broke into tears.

&quot;Ash&quot; May said startled, it was very unusual to see a 13 year old boy 
cry in front of his fianc&#130;, May comforted him,

&quot;Ever since we proposed,&quot; Ash cried &quot;my dad just gets cruel to me, he 
doesn&#39;t let me go out and see my friends or has a go at me at anything.&quot; 
Ash wasn&#39;t crying anymore he looked at May &quot; the thing that makes me 
more angry, upset is that I dragged you into it, I&#39;m leaving, tonight, 
you can stay here if you want to,&quot;

&quot;I want to go with you&quot; May cried to him &quot; where ever you go, I go with 
you, and maybe you should call your mom.&quot;

Ash thought that was a good idea, his mother, he was married to Rage she 
knew what he was like. He hadn&#39;t contacted her in ages and Angelica 
probably sends her horrible messages. He needs to see her fast.

May watched her fianc&#130; walk with his mother along the pier, having 
proper chats. Then she saw Angelica at Paz&#39;s boat talking to Floryte. 
Angelica noticed three skeletons inside. She knew Paz was the 
cold-hearted killer and every one knows that. Where was he was the 
question that Angelica knows. May was too curious, she wanted too see 
what was going on.

May found out where Paz was a skeleton near a huge tower at the south of 
Jetiendo. Eventually lead to a confession. She killed Paz in revenge of 
killing her son.

&quot; I killed your brother&quot; Angelica barked at Floryte &quot; he was a killer, a 
villain&quot;

Floryte turned scared she couldn&#39;t accept the facts that her elder 
missing brother was a killer

&quot;SHUT UP&quot; Floryte screeched as Angelica pushed her of the yacht leaving 
her too drown. The police came over and arrested Angelica and took her 
to a police car. The public where horrified. The press followed the 
police car for some questions.

Five minutes later Ash and May met up again

&quot;Angelica confessed to murder&quot; May gasp into the air as she exhales at 
to Ash in haste. As they saw the police car go into the sunset.

&quot;Good&quot; Ash weirdly answered

&quot; So what did your mom say?&quot;

&quot; She cheered me up, she told me how horrible Angelica was to her, the 
vicious lies, how she got beaten up by Rage while she was pregnant, and 
why she left.&quot;

May wrapped her arms around the broken Ash

&quot; Cheer up&quot; May said to him &quot; we are getting married on Valentines Day, 
we&#39;ve got every one from the trip, your cousin, and Tasha. So why don&#39;t 
we just have a walk in the beach and forget our problems.&quot;

An hour later Ant and Dec could not think about what to teach.

&quot; Pack up&quot; Dec announced, &quot;Every one the only work set is that there 
isn&#39;t any work&quot;

&quot; So you can do what you please while we listen to the radio&quot; Ant said 
to them all.

As Ant and Dec listened to the radio they heard the news about the 
engagement as they listened to the radio

Well the royal Lilac family is like a soap opera, Angelica confesses to 
murdering former prime minister Shelito Paz, drowning his sister when 
she didn&#39;t believe her about Paz being the killer. Zelda will be crowned 
Queen of Hyrule tomorrow. Ash and May are getting married on Valentines 
Day .Ant turned radio off

&quot;Off to the seaside&quot; Ant said

&quot;Oh I do wish to be beside the seaside&quot; Dec sung as the class walked out 
with Ant &quot;wait for me&quot;
