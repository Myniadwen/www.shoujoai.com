<h1>Dark Guardian: A Tale of Rika and Renamon (part 11 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../digimon/darkguard-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>        &quot;You aren&#39;t seriously considering accepting the challenge, are 
you?&quot; Rika demanded. The little redhead looked up at Renamon 
worriedly, then at the letter from the master of the assassin&#39;s guild 
that the kitsune still held in her hands.

        Renamon smiled grimly, &quot;I have little choice, Rika.&quot;

        &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Rika frowned.

        Renamon sighed softly before the fox-woman continued, &quot;This 
sort of challenge is intended to be a double edged sword, m&#39;love. If I 
do not choose to accept it he will simply go after you, at a time and 
place of his own choosing.&quot;

        Rika paled slightly. With Renamon as her bodyguard she had 
gotten an education in the arts of the assassin, and she knew how hard 
it was to stop a determined killer. &quot;How do we know he won&#39;t attempt 
some treachery?&quot; Rika asked.

        &quot;He won&#39;t,&quot; Renamon smiled. &quot;He may be an assassin, but m&#39;lord 
has a reputation for facing his foes honorably,&quot; she explained.

        Rika met her bodyguard&#39;s eyes and knew that the taller woman 
had already made up her mind. &quot;When do you have to go?&quot; she finally 
asked her softly.

        Renamon smiled, relieved that Rika wasn&#39;t arguing any longer. 
&quot;A few hours,&quot; she said softly, &quot;he wants us to face each other at 
midnight.&quot; Rika made a face and she had to smile back , &quot;More than a 
bit melodramatic, true.&quot;

        &quot;Come here,&quot; Rika sat down on the side of her bed.

        With a quizzical look on her face Renamon paced over to the 
younger woman&#39;s side. With a surprising swiftness Rika grasped her arm 
and pulled her down to her level, wrapping her arms around her neck 
and planting a firm kiss on her. They parted most reluctantly, leaving 
Renamon feeling more than a bit breathless.

        &quot;Rika, I..&quot; Renamon barely managed to form words.

        Rika reached out to put her finger to Renamon&#39;s lips. She 
smiled at the fox-woman and said, &quot;You are going to come back to me.&quot; 
She tugged the kitsune down beside her on the bed, &quot;And I&#39;m going to 
give you lots of reasons to.&quot;

        The kiss this time wasn&#39;t gentle, filled with unrestrained 
passion even as two bodies pressed closer together. Rika all but 
flipped the taller Renamon, looking down at her on the bed. She let 
her hands freely explore the furry body even as she brought her lips 
close to Renamon&#39;s ear.

        &quot;I&#39;ve wanted to do this for weeks you know,&quot; Rika murmured 
softly into that ear, &quot;weeks...&quot;

        Renamon slid out of the bed, trying not to disturb the soundly 
sleeping young woman. Today had been a revelation to the kitsune, in 
so many ways. Emotionally she had accepted the depth of her feelings 
for Rika, but neither of them had chosen to cross that physical line. 
Now they finally had, and it was a glorious thing.

        Renamon looked down at the sleeping girl, silently swearing 
that she would do whatever she must to protect her. Rika shifted, her 
eyes opening up sleepily and Renamon softly said to her, &quot;Go back to 
sleep.&quot;

        Rika sat up, pulling the blanket around her shyly. &quot;It&#39;s time 
for you to go,&quot; she sighed softly. She fixed Renamon with an intense 
gaze, &quot;Come back to me, my love.&quot;

        Renamon walked over to the window before giving Rika a slight 
smile, &quot;I will, I promise you.&quot; With that she leapt out the window, 
letting the night air ruffle her fur as she dropped. Smoothly she 
jumped to a nearby roof, then another, silently bounding across the 
town at night.

        The full moon glowed down at her, the cold white light giving 
the little town an eerie effect. She leapt from shadow to shadow, 
moving with assurance to the battlefield the letter had specified. 
Just beyond the town fields of wheat swayed, the golden plants almost 
ready to be harvested.

        As Renamon dropped into the middle of the field she heard a 
calm voice utter, &quot;Right on time.&quot; He seemed to simply appear from the 
shadows, the tall man all ion black. A long cloak, a bit ragged around 
the edges swirled about him, his face unnaturally pale in the 
moonlight. His eyes were piercing, an odd redish tint making them seem 
to glow.

        &quot;Lord Devimon,&quot; Renamon nodded slightly in respect. The master 
of the guild had earned his title, and even though she knew the tricks 
he used, she was still effected. &#39;Chalk and oil pales his face, the 
cloak is ragged intentionally to obscure his motions, his eyes changed 
by a certain medicine,&#39; she reminded herself, but still it was 
unnerving...

        &quot;You surprised me,&quot; Devimon admitted, standing there almost 
casually. &quot;I knew that you were good, but to defeat Lady Devimon, 
Angel and all those others? I was certain that one would have slain 
the pair of you by now,&quot; he smiled.

        &quot;I wish it hadn&#39;t been necessary,&quot; Renamon said simply, a bit 
surprised to realize it was the honest truth. Some of those slain had 
been her friends once, only their various duties putting them on 
opposite sides.

        &quot;Well said,&quot; Devimon nodded. &quot;If I win, both your and Lady 
Rika&#39;s lives are forfeit. What stakes do you demand of the guild?&quot; he 
asked.

        Renamon had spent the entire run here considering just that 
question. By ancient custom the guild had to allow her to name the 
stakes, and she chose her words very carefully. &quot;If I win,&quot; Renamon 
said, &quot;the contract on Rika is canceled, and instead a contract is 
taken out on Lord Takato. If Rika dies by anything other than old age, 
his life is forfeit.&quot;

        Devimon&#39;s lips twitched in a surprised smile, then he actually 
laughed aloud. &quot;A wonderful move,&quot; he agreed, &quot;with such a contract 
Takato would strive to protect Lady Rika, lest he die! Most devious. A 
lieutenant waits nearby, if I fall it will be done.&quot;

        &quot;Lady Rika is a good teacher,&quot; Renamon answered.

        Devimon straightened, his face becoming serious once again. 
&quot;Our battle will be to the death, student,&quot; he said softly, &quot;are you 
ready?&quot;

        And with that, he was gone.

        Renamon searched, her vision questing into the shadows, but 
there was no trace of him. Quelling her fear she closed her eyes, 
abandoning unreliable vision. Step by step she slowed her heartbeat, 
quelled her rapid breathing, and finally stood there in a pool of 
utter silence, perfectly attuned to any out of place sound.

        It may have been the cracking of a single twig, the soft swish 
of a cloak, or any one of a dozen things, but Renamon moved in that 
instant. The silvery blade flew unerringly from her hand, and a soft 
cry was heard in the darkness. Opening her eyes she saw Devimon 
holding his shoulder, a bit of red soaking the dark fabric.

        &quot;A few months ago,&quot; Devimon murmured, &quot;you would have fallen 
for that.&quot; A knife gleamed in his hand as he suddenly charged her, &quot;To 
the death.&quot;

        Renamon answered the charge, running at him. The knife in his 
hand gleamed, then as they neared he flung something in her eyes! 
Renamon howled, eyes burning as she backpedaled, feeling the burn as 
the knife swept across her arm.

        Coughing and choking Renamon wiped at her eyes, trying to 
clear her vision of the burning substance. &#39;Pepper,&#39; she realized, 
eyes watering. Devimon paced towards her, his figure blurry in her 
vision, then Renamon was struck by an inspiration.

        &quot;What..&quot; Devimon blurted as Renamon shimmered, then shrank. 
The orange haired woman grabbed him by the collar, flipping him 
backwards in one smooth motion.

        Her fingers found the blades in her arm guards with the ease 
of long practice. Renamon threw, the blades flying soundlessly, and 
with a wet thunk they struck home. One penetrated through the eye into 
the head, the other straight in puncturing the throat. Either wound 
would be fatal, both almost guaranteed it.

        The young man stepped from the trees as Renamon checked for a 
pulse and found none. He was already growing cold, no longer looking 
like some supernatural creature of evil, but instead simply a man, his 
face chalky white.

        &quot;I heard the stakes that you demanded of the guild,&quot; the red 
haired young man said gravely, &quot;and it will be done. The contract on 
Rika is null and void, and the arrangements that you asked for Takato 
will be instituted.&quot;

        &quot;Good,&quot; Renamon murmured, cupping the bloody wound on her arm. 
Her eyes narrowed, &quot;I suspect that m&#39;lord had an agreement with this 
Takato. That agreement is worth nothing now, so I would advise 
whomever controls the guild to move it, quickly.&quot;

        &quot;It will be done,&quot; the young man gently collected Devimon&#39;s 
body and was gone into the darkness of the forest.
