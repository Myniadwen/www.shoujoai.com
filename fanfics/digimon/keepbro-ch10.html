<h1>Keep Thy Brother Safe (part 10 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../digimon/keepbro-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Angelica sunbathed in the forest in the dark gloomy night as if she 
where at the beach she was in her bikini Brock on top of her was 
enjoying every momement. While Miyu Angelica&#39;s stepdaughter stood 
patiently waiting for the love to pause. Angelica violently threw Brock 
of her body and look into her Miyu&#39;s eyes they had turned yellow as a 
cute rabbit like monster Shiina on her left shoulder. 

&quot;Well&quot; Angelica hissed &quot;have you got the secret stones?&quot; then a man 
secluded and hidden in his black coat and white mask walked besides Miyu 
in a very brotherly like manner. &quot;Larva&quot; Angelica smiled carelessly 
attempting to flirt. Brock was blind to this. Miyu silently obliged 
handing about 10 or 9 gems all of different birthstones just when Miyu 
was about to hand them to the evil fiend that split second she clenched 
them tighter in her right hand and gracefully threw them to Larva whom 
his emotions where all sealed in his dark cloak and cold mask. 

&quot;Miyu&quot; Angelica smirked &quot; I have no time for games. I would like to 
return to my intercourse. Now give me the stones&quot; 

&quot; Stepmother,&quot; Miyu whispered blue eyes locked into Angelica&#39;s beautiful 
yet dark 

Dark evil black eyes beautiful yet dark as hell itself&quot; you&#39;re not 
involved with the Shinma are you or any think supernatural?&quot; 

&quot; No&quot; Angelica&#39;s face turned cold &quot;I&#39;ve never heard of the shinma&quot; 
Miyu&#39;s eyes turned yellow again, she turned to the mysterious Larva. 
&quot;The stones Larva&quot; Miyu whispered. Larva walked slowly as if he was full 
of remorse of showing up here, she slowly returned the stones to Miyu, 
one by one, and there were 9 secret stones in total. &quot;Stepmother&quot; Miyu 
hissed &quot; I will only give it to you if you promise me one thing&quot; 

&quot;Anything&quot; Angelica bowed at Miyu&#39;s feet, stroking them, Miyu stepped 
away 

&quot;Keep away from your family and never leave the forest,&quot; Miyu announced, 

&quot;You can&#39;t be serious&quot; Angelica laughed as if Miyu had threatened death 
to her. 

&quot;, You have caused enough trouble in this world as it is&quot; Miyu replied 

&quot;OK&quot; Angelica hissed. Then Miyu&#39;s eyes then turned yellow, she then 
smiled coldly as she released the stones then Angelica&#39;s face had smiled 
in joy. &quot; I shall stay in the forest for you Miyu, I promise not to get 
involved with anything evil.&quot; 

&quot; If you break any of these vows&quot; Miyu stated as if she didn&#39;t trust her 
words &quot; I shall send you and Brock to the darkness do you understand?&quot; 

&quot; What is the point&quot; Angelica asked hysterically &quot; my niece will save 
me, my son will save me&quot; 

Then Miyu&#39;s hand was deep in her kimono as she pulled something out. It 
was some kind of necklace a red heart and two yellow crescent moons on 
either side with angel wings. The moons and the heart where connected 
with purple rectangles&nbsp;

&quot;Now do you understand&quot; Miyu snapped 

&quot;Yes I do&quot; Angelica replied, &quot; so you&#39;re a Lilacess now? A secret 
servant for the queen?&quot; 

&quot;Let&#39;s go Larva&quot; Miyu announced as she turned her back on her 
stepmother. Angelica could hear their conversation far away. 

&quot;Miyu&quot; Larva whispered, &quot;I think you have made a mistake&quot; 

&quot; I am aware of her sinful ways but if she does break the rules I will 
have no choice but to send her to darkness&quot; 

&quot; You said that last time,&quot; Shiina moaned 

&quot; I mean it this time&quot; Miyu replied. 

&quot;Angelica&quot; Brock hissed as his arm went around the evil- 
beautiful-satin-princess &quot; now we can do it, our dreams will come true&quot; 

&quot;Of course&quot; She smiled as she slid on her plain clear evil gothic 
lustful dress. &quot; But first we wait&quot; Angelica ripped Brocks clothes 
of.&nbsp;&quot;Sex always comes first before anything else&quot; 

Meanwhile Ash and May where glued to the bed, arms clinging to 
eachother. 

&quot;May&quot; Ash whispered 

&quot;Yeah&quot; May replied 

&quot; When are you going to tell people you&#39;re pregnant?&quot; He asked pulling 
her head on his chest. 

&quot; I don&#39;t know.&quot; May whispered. &quot; I&#39;m just not ready for people to know 
&quot; 

&quot;Can I tell someone?&quot; 

&quot; Why, they only think of me as a slapper?&quot; May asked hastily 

&quot;Well, it&#39;s kinda hurting me not telling my mom about it&quot; 

&quot;I haven&#39;t really thought about the baby,&quot; she looked at Ash &quot;it I&#39;ve 
thinking about you really&quot; May replied 

&quot;So have I&quot; he replied 

&quot; I don&#39;t really know what happens when you&#39;re pregnant&quot; May replied 

&quot;Why don&#39;t ya ask Kari&quot; Ash thought, &quot; She was pregnant maybe she could 
help&quot; 

May got a wake up call. &quot; I should&#39;ve thought of that &quot; May reach for a 
mobile phone to ring Kari as quick as she can. &quot; Kari it&#39;s 
May.........where are you? ............. I want to know if you two would 
like to meet me somewhere tomorrow? ...................... Yeah he&#39;s
