<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/simsar.html">Simsar</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../digimon/flowers-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Author&#39;s Space: It&#39;s been nearly a friggin year to update this story and 
I know probably ONE PERSON who&#39;s read it and sent me an e-mail, they 
know who they are and I&#39;m glad. I was checking my e-mails and cleaning 
my box when I came across it. It didn&#39;t have a whole lot of depth but 
the sincerity of it was good enough for me to believe they had good 
intentions. It struck a chord and I remember the real reason people like 
me write stories. We  write them for the enjoyment of others, to make a 
difference be it large or small is up to the person writing and the 
person reading it. I miss the times when I&#39;d submitted fictions and was 
eager just to get a little bit of love. Now I&#39;m older and jaded and I&#39;m 
not as caring. That one e-mail brought back the nostalgia of what it was 
for me when I was really being a writer and not some punk trying to cash 
in on their skills like a lot of others. 

This story is for the readers, may they never end. 

-Sim 

--- 
 
Mimi rolled over on her side; she didn&#39;t want to get up. The couch she&#39;d 
taken up as residence was at the least comfortable and at the most 
astoundingly. Izzy was up and out by the single digits that morning and 
Tai&#39;s snore could be heard from inside his room still meaning Mimi was 
the only living soul up in the apartment. She lay there, enjoying the 
moment. This wasn&#39;t some chair in the airplane or some crappy springy 
mattress she&#39;d bought, this was a mattress that&#39;d been broken in by 
people who had no intentions of destruction, and it was simply bliss. 

She looked at her digi-vice which she&#39;d never taken off her wrist since 
last night. It was 10 after 10 and the sun was beating through the 
windows. She groaned in protest and finally sat up. Her eyes adjusted to 
the light slowly. The apartment didn&#39;t look as terrible in the night as 
it did in the day. In the day it looked almost livable minus the whole 
mess in the corner which last night looked a lot bigger. She rubbed her 
nose and blew a lungful of air out to clear it. She got up and 
stretched, still in her red panties with her breasts exposed. She 
sported the ever present white skinned outline around each. She looked 
for Palmon who was asleep at the foot of her would be bed, wrapped in a 
blanket of her own. 

Mimi rubbed the sleep out of her eyes as she made her way to the 
bathroom. She itched the small of her back as she walked. The tile floor 
was covered by a shaggy bath rug for the most part. Mimi pulled the 
curtain closed and turned the water on letting it get warm before 
jumping in. She pulled her panties down revealing her vagina. It looked 
like it was shaved but hadn&#39;t been in a few days since the hair, though 
short, was growing back. She looked at herself in the mirror for a 
minute. She&#39;d seen herself in a worse condition, the digi-world being 
the biggest offender to her naturally slim and refined frame. She 
twisted and looked at her back, especially her butt which was still 
shapely despite the lack of care. She looked for a razor, snatched it 
and carried it in with her. 

The hot water rushed the last remains of sleep out of her, relaxing her 
muscles, which were still tense from last night. She&#39;d been tense for so 
long and this shower wasn&#39;t luke warm either, it was a full on steamy 
one. Her parents did spoil her; she knew that after living alone but 
this, this was the perfect example of what she missed. She missed being 
pampered with nice warm water, warm sheets, and a lack of care for once. 
Her troubles washed off her as well as the smell of the airplane. She 
moaned and sat down letting the water crashed into her. Mimi curled up 
grabbing her knees and looking down at her feet. She looked past that 
and into the surreal of her mind. The memories may not always trouble 
her but every once in a while they&#39;d come back to haunt her. 

---- 

&quot;Mom, you can&#39;t be serious!&quot; Mimi whined. 

&quot;I&#39;m serious. Mimi, you&#39;ve had no direction period since we came to 
America.&quot; Her mom said bringing out the big guns right away, &quot;Your 
grades have gotten steadily worse and the teachers are saying you have a 
major lack of progress in all your courses.&quot; 

&quot;I want to be a cook, not an accountant.&quot; Mimi said in defense of her 
slacking. 

&quot;I don&#39;t want to hear it. You either bring your grades up in two weeks 
or after this semester your father and I are cutting you off.&quot; 

She knew it was coming, there&#39;s always one day when a child has to leave 
the nest and move on with their lives but why&#39;d it have to be now? For 
that matter, why two weeks, nothing can be improved in two weeks!?! Mimi 
let out a low growl and stormed away wishing her parents would just 
forget about it for once. 

---- 

Mimi looked up and mopped her face with her hand which did nothing 
considering the shower was still on. She didn&#39;t want to focus on the 
memories, they did nothing but hold her down. She stood up, the razor 
still in her hand. Mimi went in between her legs and trimmed it down 
till it was smooth. She continued her strokes taking her legs in stride. 
No cuts thankfully but she&#39;d never wanted it to get that bad again, it 
was too gross. 

She shut the water off, grabbed a towel which was as soft as the blanket 
she slept in. Despite the spartan like appearance, Izzy really did have 
nice stuff for the apartment. She felt in between her legs running her 
hand over her folds. It was a clean shave, no nicks or cuts. She set the 
razor down and looked at herself in the mirror again. A much more 
refreshed Mimi stared back into her and smiled. She felt a lot better 
now as she set the razor down absent-mindly. 

She pulled her panties back up and walked out of the restroom. Palmon 
was visible, tanning in the sun light of the sliding glass door leading 
out to the balcony. Mimi smiled at Palmon who took no notice of her. She 
kept her smile and crept towards her.

&quot;Boo!&quot; She shouted quickly. 

Palmon shrieked and jumped into the air in a protest. 

&quot;Mimi!&quot; Palmon shouted, &quot;Jeez, give a plant a heart attack.&quot; 

Mimi rolled her eyes, bending down to grab her bra which matched her red 
panties. She closed the clasp in the front and moved her breasts around 
till they were comfortable. Being satisfied with that, she pulled on her 
sweater and her jeans. She rummaged around the sheets to find her socks 
which she must&#39;ve removed in the night. She pulled them on and then put 
on her boots. 

Tai walked out of his room, his face was expressing every feeling he 
had. The massive hang over he must&#39;ve been sporting was something to 
behold as even the sight of Mimi who Tai didn&#39;t know was here, shocked 
him little. 

&quot;Hi Mimi...&quot; He said quietly. 

&quot;He-&quot; Mimi was cut off with a loud shhhhh by Tai, &quot;Keep it down. My 
heads ringin&#39; like a bell.&quot; 

&quot;Oh.&quot; Mimi whispered, &quot;Sorry.&quot; 

Tai waved it off and as he walked past the couch, Mimi realized Tai was 
pants less. His tighty whities revealed a great amount of the guy. He 
scratched his butt as he walked with the other hand hold his head. He 
opened the fridge, throwing his hand up to block the light. Tai let out 
a little whine as he rummaged through the items finally settling up with 
a carton of milk. He chugged it within the time it took a normal person 
to fill a glass of water and set it down on the counter top. 

&quot;Ugh...&quot; Tai looked at Mimi, his milk mustache running down the top of 
his lips, &quot;Wait a minute. Aren&#39;t you supposed to be in like... Austin or 
Minnetonka or something?&quot; Tai paused for a minute, &quot;Or am I still drunk 
and this is a dream?&quot; 

Mimi just nodded quietly and gave an apologetic smile, &quot;Wow... that&#39;s 
totally the last time I mix Bacardi with anything.&quot; He uttered. 

Tai wandered back to the restroom leaving the carton standing on the 
counter. He shut the door behind him. Mimi made her way to the kitchen 
and looked at the milk carton. Her eye twitched, it was expired by a 
week and Tai had no idea. What the hell happened to him while she was 
away? He used to be so much less... loser-ish. 

&quot;Where&#39;s my razor?&quot; Tai asked. 

Mimi&#39;s eyebrows crunched, &quot;I don&#39;t think you want to use it.&quot; Mimi 
replied. 

&quot;Why? I found it by the way.&quot; Tai called back from the rest room. 

&quot;I used it.&quot; Mimi answered. 

&quot;All hairs the same you know...&quot; Tai corrected.

Mimi didn&#39;t want to reveal something like the fact that she shaved her 
privates to Tai. The thought of that might lead him to make an ass out 
of himself. 

&quot;Just remember to wash it &#39;kay?&quot; Mimi pleaded.

While Tai got cleaned up, Mimi started cooking. One thing she could do 
without anything bothering her was mix some eggs and cook some bacon. 
Despite the fact that she didn&#39;t know algebra down to a &#39;t&#39;, no pun 
intended, she did know that adding a few things to thicken up the 
scramble eggs only added to the enjoyment. The bacon was flat as sheets 
and half of them were flimsy and the other half crisp and breakable. 

Tai came out with his nose in the air getting a whiff of the good food 
in the kitchen, &quot;Whoa...&quot; He muttered. 

Mimi brushed her forehead as she worked setting up plates for Tai and 
herself at the kitchen table. Tai cracked his neck and pulled the chair 
back for him and her. He took a seat as Mimi grabbed the food and moved 
it to the table. 

&quot;This ought to help.&quot; Mimi answered. 

&quot;You bet. I&#39;m usually surviving off sandwiches and microwave dinners.&quot; 

Mimi smiled, &quot;Yeah, well, I have thing with food. I enjoy it.&quot; 

&quot;No seat for me?&quot; Palmon asked. 

Tai looked around, &quot;Alright, who&#39;s the wise guy?&quot; 

&quot;Tai, Palmon is with me.&quot; Mimi answered.

Tai looked down and looked at Palmon who was standing away from him, &quot;I 
figured all the Digimon would be hanging with Davis.&quot; 

&quot;Mimi needed me.&quot; Palmon replied. 

&quot;How so?&quot; 

&quot;Long story.&quot; Mimi answered, &quot;I got all day to do nothing, gimme the low 
down.&quot; Tai pried. 

The one thing Mimi could tell him was her problems. She felt better 
every time she talked about them. Keeping them bottled up for so long 
was hurtful to her. Tai, despite his changes still cared for his 
friends. All through the conversation, Tai sat eating the eggs and bacon 
and nodding at the right moments, saying comforting things when there 
needed to be comforting. Mimi looked down at her plate of eggs. Palmon 
was silent as a grave. 

Tai stretched and groaned a minute, &quot;Well, guess that means you get to 
be a phoenix.&quot; 

Mimi looked at him, &quot;I don&#39;t get it.&quot; 

&quot;Phoenix, the, bird that dies and turns to ashes and is reborn from 
them.&quot; Tai reiterated. 

&quot;Still not following you.&quot; Mimi answered. 

&quot;Basically you get to start over again. Your parents booted you out, 
Izzy and I left and I had a job back then and Izzy had a job that was 
literally going uphill. I quit mine and started slacking, Izzy was nice 
enough to keep me around, figured I was good for a laugh.&quot; Tai finished, 
he took a bite of some eggs, &quot;These are so much better than when I 
attempt.&quot; 

Mimi smiled, &quot;So, I need some new clothes or at least, I need a place to 
wash my old ones. Any money lying around?.&quot; 

Tai scrunched his lips in thought, &quot;Yep, Izzy usually keeps some cash 
lying on his dresser in case of, you know, &#39;emergencies&#39;.&quot; Tai answered 
using his fingers to make quotation marks, &quot;You want me to throw your 
old stuff out for you while you go shopping?&quot; 

Mimi knew that one, oldest trick in the book, &quot;No you perv, I&#39;ll handle 
that one myself.&quot; 

Tai snapped his finger, &quot;Darn, looks like traveling hasn&#39;t dulled you.&quot; 

&quot;Nice try, but still, a little less straight forward next time.&quot; Mimi 
teased. 

&quot;I&#39;ll work on it.&quot; Tai answered coyly. 

Mimi walked into Izzy&#39;s room and grabbed the wad full of cash from 
inside the night stand. Thumbing through it, she wasn&#39;t surprised to 
find a good 25 thousand yen stashed. She pulled out ten thousand and put 
it in her purse. She&#39;d had to cash in the remains of her 50 U.S. Dollars 
at customs or some place because it wouldn&#39;t do much good here. 

Tai flopped onto the love seat, grabbed Mimi&#39;s blanket and wrapped 
himself up in it. Mimi emptied out her suitcase which had another change 
of clothes which were three days worn. She&#39;d had to pairs of clothes 
since she moved; finding out that clothes were expensive and so was 
food. She grabbed the pile, stuffed it in the trashcan and made for the 
door, &quot;Watch out for Palmon for me.&quot; 

Tai gave a thumbs up, taking the remote and flipping on the T.V. Palmon 
looked at Mimi concerned, she mouthed &#39;Don&#39;t let him do anything 
stupid...&#39; to Palmon nodded and sat back. She shut the door behind her 
and started down the stairs. 

---- 

Sora stayed up late, long after Matt had gone to bed. She&#39;d been pretty 
steamed at Matt for all this mud slinging the night before. She awoke at 
9 and was dressed and cleaned up by 9:15. She picked out her favorite 
blue hat, still being partial to the ones with the balls on the end of 
them. She blamed it on nostalgia, seeing Mimi last night broke back a 
tidal wave of the good old times. She was wearing white long sleeve 
shirt over a brown vest. Her pale skin tight khaki&#39;s were snug around 
her legs. 

Since there was no sense getting all cleaned and dressed for nothing she 
needed something to do. She looked at the photos of the clothes Matt and 
she designed; he&#39;d been through them since she was usually the neat 
freak. She peered through them as she went, feeling a bit of anger rise 
in her chest when she came across one that Matt designed. Still, she had 
to admit, what they had was beautiful, despite the rough spots. She 
looked at the photos again. Her thoughts wandered to those rough spots. 

She knew Matt was tired of being connected to the others, despite the 
friendship they all shared; Matt was practically divorced from the rest 
simply because he didn&#39;t want to be related to a slacker like Tai or a 
genius like Izzy. He wanted to be himself and for him, that meant he 
needed to be secluded. Sora loved him, she could give herself that. He 
had the rough and gruff edges but she still loved him for who he was. He 
was strong and he knew what he, no, they wanted. Sometimes it was bleak 
though, especially when they were first starting out. He was always 
working, never leaving time to be happy with the relationship and Sora 
understood, this whole thing was a gamble, selling their first design 
wasn&#39;t going to be easy and they couldn&#39;t think it&#39;d work out with the 
first pitch. 

Sora&#39;s gaze was mute, looking past the physical nature of the pictures 
and into her deepest memories. Matt would yell at her, blame her for the 
problems, say things he didn&#39;t mean. Every memory was more resolve 
telling her this was a damned relationship. Why the hell was she with 
this guy? Sure he was strong, handsome and all those things but was it 
really worth it? Was it worth suffering every couple months when he&#39;d 
grow miserable and yell? Sora bit her lower lip and came back to 
reality. She needed something to take her mind off this business with 
Matt. Sora grabbed her purse, checked her money and got up from the 
table. She had some money and the only thing that really seemed to make 
her smile was shopping. First reason, she could draw off a dress she 
saw, simply seeing it would inspire her and uplift her and two, nothing 
was more enjoyable then trying on things she couldn&#39;t afford. 

She left the house it was 11 in the morning with the sun just beginning 
to get over head. Her favorite blue hat with the poof balls hanging from 
the strings bounced fervently as she walked through the sidewalks to the 
Shibuya shopping district. 

---- 

Mimi had to admit, the population density in Japan was a lot larger from 
the last time she was there. The shopping district in general was 
literally packed wall to wall with people. She figured she&#39;d hit all the 
malls, especially the Shibuya 109 department store, one of her all time 
favorite and most up to date stores in all of Japan. The streets were 
flooded, considering it was like fighting the tide of the ocean except 
there&#39;s generally no good direction to it. She pushed and shoved her way 
towards the fabled department store. She held her purse close, despite 
the low crime rate; she was still sketchy after living in America for so 
long. 

She came up on the store, opened the door and finally got her first 
breather. Mimi hunched down, putting her hands on her bent knees and 
taking a second. She drew a deep breath and raised herself back up. Now 
it was time to find some things for her and her alone. 

---- 

Sora stood staring at the beautiful sequin red dress. It was incased in 
glass, as if it was too good to be touched by Sora or any one. The rich 
crimson silk was exploding in front of her. The curves of the dress were 
astounding. No straps, meaning it was held up by being tailored to fit 
so far as she could tell. The frills hanging off the edges of the hem 
only extended the beauty of the dress. She knew she couldn&#39;t fit in that 
dress and look good. Her skinny as a rail body and lack of breasts to 
keep the dress lifted sealed that dream in a box and dropped it in an 
ocean. 

&quot;Sora?&quot; 

Sora turned around, gasping in fright for a moment. Mimi was looking at 
her less than three feet away. Sora put her hand to her chest to catch 
her breath. 

&quot;Jeez.&quot; Sora said taking quick breaths, a look of relief on her face. 

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Mimi replied quietly, &quot;didn&#39;t know you were that spaced out.&quot; 

Sora waved it off, &quot;It&#39;s no biggie.&quot; She smiled, a feeling of comfort 
washed over her, just seeing Mimi made her feel better. 

Mimi cut straight to the point, &quot;You and Matt huh?&quot; Mimi asked. 

&quot;Wha- Oh! Yeah...&quot; Sora said, nearly forgetting Matt for a second, the 
why to this eluded her. She blamed the dress. 

&quot;Nice dress, this what you were peering at?&quot; Mimi asked. 

Sora nodded, Mimi looked at her, &quot;You&#39;d look fabulous in it.&quot; 

Sora looked back at her with an eyebrow raised, &quot;Serious?&quot; 

Mimi spied it, &quot;Your body is just slim enough to fit in and your boobs 
work just right and your red hair really would accentuate the whole 
thing.&quot; Sora stared on in surprise, &quot;How can you tell all this?&quot; 

Mimi laughed a bit, &quot;I&#39;ve been wearing high end clothing for a very long 
time. I know what works. That dress... it works. You don&#39;t believe me, 
go ahead and try it on.&quot; 

&quot;Mimi, c&#39;mon, I couldn&#39;t fit in that dress, it&#39;d slide right off me.&quot; 
Sora replied, Mimi shook her head, &quot;Nope... the sash on the back helps 
keep it up even more and the fact that the sash runs criss cross up the 
back simple helps keep it tight. It&#39;s like a corset, except smoother and 
less constrictive. Go on and try it.&quot; 

Sora thought on it for a moment, &quot;Alright Mimi, I&#39;ll try it but I&#39;m 
still skeptical.&quot; 

Sora called an employee over. They escorted Mimi and Sora towards the 
dressing room and left them there while he went to get the dress. Sora 
was blushing profusely. Anxious to feel this dress, Mimi didn&#39;t help 
either. She was her best friend and she wouldn&#39;t judge her but she knew 
she didn&#39;t want to disappoint Mimi for her hunch on the dress. 

&quot;So, looking for a Job at the moment?&quot; Sora asked as they waited. 

&quot;Nah, right now I need new clothes. The ones you saw last night were the 
only other pair I had and they&#39;ve both been worn to the brink. I&#39;m 
throwing these away after I find myself some new ones.&quot; Mimi answered. 

Sora looked down, &quot;That&#39;s terrible.&quot; Mimi looked at her, &quot;Your parents, 
why would they just boot you out?&quot; she asked. 

&quot;I&#39;m 20 years old and I wasn&#39;t in college due to my poor grades. My 
parents knew full well that I had no ambition and pitched me. I can&#39;t 
fault them to tell the truth.&quot; 

&quot;Still, it&#39;s a ratty and mean thing to do.&quot; Sora concluded. 

&quot;You&#39;re right on that account, but I&#39;m not going to hate my parents for 
making a decision that was probably the hardest choice for them.&quot; Mimi 
looked up, &quot;To be honest, I think I needed it.&quot; 

Sora looked at her, &quot;How so?&quot; 

&quot;All my life, I was the prissy, hard to please, traveling, rich girl. 
Too rich for my own good; handed everything and the kitchen sink on a 
whim. They threw me out and I learned moderation, adaptation and 
survival.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Sora answered, &quot;but that doesn&#39;t mean it was right.&quot; 

&quot;Sometimes that sort of thing doesn&#39;t have to be.&quot; Mimi replied 
somberly, &quot;Still, I figured it wasn&#39;t good to dwell in the past, if 
anything, you would know it&#39;s best to turn your back on it.&quot; 

Sora sat quiet on the bench, taking in Mimi&#39;s sage like advice. She&#39;d 
changed alright, definitely for the better, but underneath all her new 
wisdom, there was still the same old Mimi. The one she&#39;d grown up 
giggling with, talking with and in this case shopping with. 

The employee brought the dress around and handed it to Sora who took it 
by the hanger, doing her best not to mess with the dress till she was in 
the changing room. Mimi smiled, showing her eagerness to see Sora in the 
dress as well. 

---- 

Mimi sat quietly waiting for Sora to get changed. She couldn&#39;t help but 
smile. Sora looked happy and if she wasn&#39;t, she could make an excellent 
stage actor. Mimi knew she was right though. Despite Sora&#39;s lack of 
confidence which all girls had including her, she knew full well Sora 
could fit. She heard the door unlatch. Mimi stood up and turned and 
looked at the most beautiful combination she&#39;d ever seen. Sora&#39;s red 
hair went perfect for the dress which she&#39;d noticed was slightly lighter 
at the top and got darker as it went down. Her supple and milky breasts 
were pushed up by the tight mid section which fit to her overall body 
structure. Her hips which had gotten wider since she&#39;d seen Sora, were a 
perfect fit to the overall dress and went all the way down to her feet. 
She&#39;d taken her shoes off leaving her bare foot. 

&quot;Well?&quot; Sora asked hesitantly. 

&quot;Majestic comes to mind.&quot; Mimi replied, &quot;Truly majestic.&quot; 

Sora bowed her head, &quot;You&#39;re not just telling me this to make me feel 
good right?&quot; 

&quot;Why would I?&quot; Mimi asked, &quot;Sora, face it. You&#39;re beautiful in that 
dress, like it or not.&quot; 

She looked at Mimi, &quot;No B.S.?&quot; 

&quot;No B.S.&quot; Mimi answered. 

---- 

After changing out of the dress and buying it which, for the record, 
cost 100,000 yen out right, Mimi and Sora went shopping for Mimi&#39;s new 
wardrobe. All the while, the two girls caught up with each other, 
something Mimi was wishing for from the get go. Sora told her about how 
after breaking up with Tai, she went with Matt and the two settled down 
to pursue a career in fashion design. Matt had the connections and Sora 
had the style, how could they lose right? 

Mimi patted her on the back as they walked. So far they&#39;d both made 
their way on selling one design here, another design there, but nothing 
getting totally off the ground. It all seemed to be going well with the 
design stuff for a little while and slowly it was beginning to crumble. 

&quot;You&#39;ll work it all out Sora, I have faith.&quot; Mimi answered. 

&quot;I know, but that makes one of us.&quot; Sora said meekly. 

&quot;Keep your chin up.&quot; Mimi said putting her hand on Sora&#39;s shoulder, 
&quot;You&#39;re glummer than me.&quot; 

&quot;Hah...&quot; Sora answered sarcastically. 

--- 

It was well into the evening when Mimi got back home. Izzy was sitting 
at the computer, tacking away as usual. Tai was in the exact same spot 
he was in before she left and Palmon was asleep on the couch. Mimi had 
two bags full of clothes that she and Sora had picked out and she&#39;d 
tried on. 

&quot;Hey Mimi...&quot; Tai and Izzy replied in tandem, not bothering to look. 

&quot;Hey guys.&quot; Mimi answered, &quot;Izzy, I need to-&quot; 

&quot;Tai told me.&quot; Izzy responded before she finished, &quot;It&#39;s cool. I 
personally don&#39;t know what its like not to have clothes but we all know 
what it&#39;s like NOT getting them washed for a couple days.&quot; 

&quot;Like that time we were on the island for the first time and didn&#39;t know 
how to survive?&quot; Tai laughed. 

Izzy let out a small chuckle, &quot;Ah yeah, good times... nothing sucked 
more than smelling like a foot for two days and finally getting a bath 
in a river.&quot; 

&quot;So true... So true...&quot; Tai repeated. 

Mimi set her bags down and flopped onto her bed/couch and curled up with 
Palmon who woke quietly and latched onto her just before slipping off 
into dreams again. 

&quot;So? Get any panties?&quot; Tai asked. 

Izzy&#39;s head slumped and Mimi looked over scornfully, &quot;Shut up Tai...&quot; He 
let off a little giggle and changed the channel.
