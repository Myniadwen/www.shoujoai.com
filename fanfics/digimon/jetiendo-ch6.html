fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../digimon/jetiendo-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>It was about midnight the trip had lasted a week. Ash could not sleep 
nor T.K they both had nothing to do 

&quot; Ash&quot; whispered T.K &quot; is it true? You and May are an item. Like lovers, 
Gary told Davis and he like told the entire world&quot; 

&quot; Yeah&quot; Ash replied &quot; is it true that you and Kari are an item&quot; 

&quot; Yeah&quot; T.K answered 

&quot; Davis ain&#39;t gonna be happy about that&quot; 

&quot; No.&quot; T.K took a walk around the dark room. &quot;I&#39;m bored,&quot; T.K hissed&quot; 
ever since that Mr Grinal came along its ruined every thing&quot; 

&quot; Hey&quot; Ash replied, &quot; Why don&#39;t we go to the girls dormitory to see Kari 
and May.&quot; 

&quot; That&#39;s a great idea&quot; T.K gasped, &quot; I bet you they ain&#39;t snoring&quot; 

&quot; No&quot; Ash said 

Meanwhile in the girls dormitory May and Kari where wide-awake talking 
above love 

&quot; First I did it to make Davis jealous&quot; Kari said to May &quot; and then as I 
spent more time with him it got closer then at 5 pm we kissed. I&#39;m never 
gonna forget this trip&quot; 

&quot;Well it mine was just a crazy thing to me&quot; May replied &quot; but love sinks 
you deeper. Deeper you can ever feel&quot; 

Then the girls dormitory door burst open Ash and T.K where there as if 
they were waiting for May and Kari.
