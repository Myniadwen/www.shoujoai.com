<h1>Kidan (part 5 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/9thchild.html">Shinji Shazaki</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../digimon/kidan-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&quot;I was so scared-I thought you were dead-I thought Etemon killed you-I 
missed you so much!&quot;  Hikari&#39;s sentences were broken by the ardent 
kisses she planted on Shinji&#39;s lips and cheeks.  Shinji didn&#39;t protest 
to this, despite the looks that a few students were giving them as they 
passed.  In fact, she could have cared less about other people.  All she 
wanted at that moment was for Hikari to stay wrapped in her arms for as 
long as possible.

&quot;How did you survive?&quot; Hikari asked after a few pleasant minutes of 
kissing Shinji to express her joy.  &quot;You were already so hurt by the 
time the others found us and then you took that attack full on!  Oh, 
gods, thank you!  You saved my life again and Taichi&#39;s life as well!  I 
can never thank you enough, Shinji!&quot;  Shinji managed to slide two of her 
fingers onto Hikari&#39;s lips to quiet her, her trademark faint smile 
curling her lips.

&quot;I owe my life to a digimon named Wizardmon,&quot; she explained.  &quot;If he 
hadn&#39;t found me and healed me a bit, Vandemon wouldn&#39;t have been able to 
save me.  He says he knows Tailmon, so he came with Vandemon and I 
here.&quot;  At her words, two digimon, one tall and the other short, stepped 
out from the shade of the trees near the pathway.  A tree&#39;s leaves 
rustled again before Tailmon leapt from the branch.

&quot;Wizardmon!&quot; the cat cried.  &quot;I can&#39;t believe it!  It&#39;s really you!&quot;

&quot;Tailmon,&quot; Wizardmon murmured.  &quot;Oh, my dearest friend.  I&#39;ve missed 
you.&quot;  The two embraced each other in a tight hug that revealed how much 
they had indeed missed each other in these eight years apart.  Vandemon 
let out a sigh as he rolled his eyes.

&quot;First the humans can&#39;t let go of each other and now the digimon are 
grabbing each other,&quot; he said in a teasing growl.  &quot;How pathetic are you 
people, exactly?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s see how you act when you find someone you care about,&quot; Shinji 
muttered over Hikari&#39;s shoulder.  Vandemon laughed.

&quot;I&#39;m too much of a lady killer,&quot; he chuckled.  &quot;In more ways than one, 
of course.&quot;  His wicked grin was not lost upon Shinji, but Hikari, 
Tailmon, and Wizardmon did not seem to notice that Vandemon had insulted 
them at all.

&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have run into the Digital World without Tailmon,&quot; Hikari 
said, resting her head against Shinji&#39;s chest as her smile faded.  &quot;That 
was so stupid of me.&quot;

&quot;Why did you do that?&quot; Shinji asked.  Hikari looked quite hesitant to 
answer.

&quot;My mother...threw me out,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;She asked me why I didn&#39;t 
go to school on Friday and I told her I like you.  She didn&#39;t take it 
well.  She called you a few things I don&#39;t want to repeat.&quot;  Shinji 
looked at her, studying her downcast face for a long moment.

&quot;She called you a few things as well, didn&#39;t she?&quot; she asked.  Hikari 
hesitated before nodding.  &quot;I think we need to pay your mother a visit.&quot;

&quot;Shinji, no!&quot; Hikari cried in protest and worry.  &quot;Please, I&#39;m sorry 
that she said those terrible things about you, but don&#39;t try to make her 
change her mind about us!  She won&#39;t ever think any differently about 
this!  Don&#39;t make her hate you any more than she already does!&quot;  Shinji 
gave her a small smile.

&quot;I was actually thinking that we needed to get your things from your 
mother&#39;s apartment since you&#39;re moving in with me,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;But 
if she says things that hurt you, I can&#39;t promise I won&#39;t retaliate.  
All I&#39;ll promise is that I will not touch your mother for whatever she 
says.&quot;  Hikari let out a soft sigh of relief.  &quot;Oy, Vandemon!  Come on.  
You can help me get Hikari&#39;s stuff to my house.&quot;

&quot;What am I, your delivery service?&quot; Vandemon questioned, though with a 
smirk.

----------

Mrs. Yagami Yuuko was one of many people that despised Westerners.  She 
hated all the idiotic tourists that came to Tokyo and mangled the 
beloved language of Japan while hiding inside their insipid little 
&quot;Tokyo Disneyland.&quot;  She loathed the American occupiers in Okinawa and 
their rapist manners.  But for the past three days, she found one good 
thing about the western world: hard whiskey.  It was so much more 
effective than sak&eacute; in making her forget about Hikari.

On Monday afternoon, just thirty minutes after she knew Hikari would get 
out of school for the day, a knock came from the door.  Mrs. Yagami 
jumped, wondering if someone, Taichi perhaps, had come to see why Hikari 
had been ejected from the apartment.  She stood, leaving the glass and 
one-third empty bottle on the table as she walked to the door.  She 
opened it without bothering to look from the peephole.

&quot;Hello, Mrs. Yagami,&quot; Shinji said, lifting a hand in greeting.  Mrs. 
Yagami tried to slam the door shut in return, but Shinji pressed her 
hand against it to keep it from shutting.  &quot;Thought we&#39;d come and get 
some of Hikari&#39;s stuff now that she&#39;ll be living with me.&quot;  Mrs. Yagami 
looked ready to slap Shinji at those words.

&quot;You&#39;re disgusting,&quot; she snarled.  Shinji sighed, took a small smell of 
the air, and raised her eyebrows.

&quot;Yes, well, you&#39;re not exactly my favorite drunk in the world,&quot; she 
murmured.  &quot;Now can you please move so we can get to Hikari&#39;s room?&quot;

&quot;Why the hell would I do that?&quot; Mrs. Yagami snorted, leaning forwards to 
glare at the young woman.

&quot;Since you threw her out, she&#39;ll need her things,&quot; Shinji sighed in 
exasperation.  &quot;Or did all of that alcohol you&#39;ve been drinking make you 
forget that you threw her out of your apartment?&quot;  Mrs. Yagami ground 
her teeth together with an audible growl.  Shinji glared at her.  &quot;Let 
us by-now.&quot;  When Mrs. Yagami did nothing but snarl at her, Shinji&#39;s 
hand slipped into a leather pouch on her hip.

Mrs. Yagami jumped back when Shinji lifted a shuriken before the older 
woman&#39;s eyes.  Shinji slammed the door against the wall and threw the 
shuriken down.  It wedged itself against the floor and the door, jamming 
it open as Shinji and Hikari walked inside.  Livid didn&#39;t seem quite 
heavy enough to describe Shinji&#39;s anger.  Her hands actually shot out 
for the older woman&#39;s shirt collar, but she froze a centimeter from 
touching Mrs. Yagami.

&quot;Damn it *all*,&quot; Shinji hissed, her blue eyes narrow.  She crossed her 
arms and turned away from Mrs. Yagami.  She closed her eyes and let her 
head fall back, her face to the ceiling.  After a moment, she snapped.  
Her eyes fell upon the whiskey bottle on the table before she lashed out 
with her foot.  The bottle flew into the wall from the kick, shattering 
on impact.  Hikari and her mother jumped at the sound.

&quot;Temper, temper, Shinji,&quot; a deep voice chuckled.  Vandemon stepped into 
the apartment, his head almost touching the ceiling.  &quot;You shouldn&#39;t 
smash the woman&#39;s drink, even if she is a drunk wretch.&quot;  Shinji looked 
up at the ceiling and did not reply.  &quot;Come here.&quot;  His commanding tone 
seemed to break through Shinji&#39;s rage; she turned about and walked to 
where Hikari stood.  The two young women slipped into Hikari&#39;s room, 
Vandemon following after giving Mrs. Yagami his most wicked smirk.  He 
shut the door behind him.

&quot;Shinji, are-&quot; Hikari started to say.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Shinji said tersely, her eyes squeezed tightly shut.  &quot;She 
made me angry.  I just...dammit, I don&#39;t know.&quot;  Hikari wrapped her arms 
around Shinji before the older woman could say anything more.

&quot;I was going to ask if you&#39;re all right,&quot; she said softly.  &quot;I know 
you&#39;re mad.  I don&#39;t care that you&#39;re angry with my mother.  I just want 
you to be happy-I want you to be happy with me.  Let&#39;s just get my 
things and go.  I don&#39;t want to make you stay here if it makes you 
unhappy.&quot;  Shinji paused a short second before nodding.  Hikari laid a 
quick kiss on Shinji&#39;s cheek before taking her by the wrist to assist 
her in the work.

Hikari made quick work of giving Vandemon the things that she wanted and 
needed.  He effortlessly passed them into shadows and reassured Hikari 
and Shinji that Hikari&#39;s things would be waiting for them at Shinji&#39;s 
house.  Fifteen minutes later, Hikari stood in a bare room.  She looked 
about, trying not to think of how much time she had spent in the 
apartment-in that very room-only to be kicked out by her mother.  The 
hand that Shinji laid on her shoulder was comforting.

&quot;Let&#39;s go home,&quot; Hikari whispered.  Shinji nodded and both left the room 
Hikari once lived in.  Mrs. Yagami stood before the door, glaring with 
her arms crossed.

&quot;What now?&quot; Shinji snarled.

&quot;I&#39;m sure no one has been told of what a criminal this woman is,&quot; Mrs. 
Yagami said loudly, her words directed at everyone and no one at the 
same time.  &quot;She would have been punished for being a thief if her 
parents hadn&#39;t been killed.  And there&#39;s no evidence to say that she 
didn&#39;t kill them herself.  Incredible.  My daughter is not only sleeping 
with a filthy whore, but a murderer and a thief as well.&quot;  Shinji did 
not make any move or reply.  She simply took Hikari by the hand and 
walked for the door.

Just before the two women and one digimon left, Shinji picked up a piece 
of paper near the apartment&#39;s phone and wrote down a number.  The 
message she wrote to accompany it read: &quot;If you want to call your 
daughter, this is my phone number.  -Shazaki Shinji.&quot;  She stabbed the 
paper to the wall with the shuriken that she pried free from holding 
open the door.  When the group left, Mrs. Yagami fell to her knees and 
sobbed.

----------

Vandemon returned to the Digital World with his magic, leaving Hikari 
and Shinji to walk to Shinji&#39;s house.  The two walked in a painful 
silence all the way to the Rainbow Bridge.  Shinji stopped halfway 
across the bridge and looked over the side to the water of Tokyo Harbor 
below.

&quot;You can ask me,&quot; she murmured, &quot;about what your mother said.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care,&quot; Hikari said firmly.  &quot;I don&#39;t care about how you were 
back when you were twelve.  Everyone has problems when they&#39;re growing 
up.  Yours were just...you had more problems than I&#39;ve ever heard of 
someone having!  But look at you now!  You have your own store, you&#39;ve 
saved my life almost half a dozen times, and I love you so much!  For 
the gods&#39; sake Shinji-I don&#39;t care about it!  I want you to be happy and 
this won&#39;t make you happy.  It&#39;ll tear you apart-it&#39;s already tearing 
you apart.  Please, just forget about it.&quot;  Shinji looked at her for a 
moment before turning back towards Akasaka.

&quot;Let&#39;s go home,&quot; she said, repeating Hikari&#39;s words of a few minutes 
earlier.  They did not speak until they reached Shinji&#39;s house.  The sun 
was beginning to set by then, casting deep red light over the windows.  
Shinji unlocked the door to the house, walking inside but pausing when 
she realized that Hikari was standing just outside the door.  She turned 
to ask Hikari what was wrong, but Hikari walked forward when Shinji&#39;s 
eyes fell upon her.

&quot;I&#39;m home, Shinji,&quot; the burgundy-eyed girl said with a smile.  There was 
a pause before Shinji smiled at her in return.

&quot;Welcome home, Hikari,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;Listen, do you want to take a 
bath?  You seem a bit...messy.&quot;  Hikari looked at herself and blushed.  
Her hair was unwashed and frumpy from not bothering to brush it over 
three days.  The boy&#39;s uniform she borrowed from Taichi was wrinkled 
from a prolonged stay in a box in his closet and was far too large for 
the girl.

&quot;No offense, but you aren&#39;t any better,&quot; she giggled in return.  Shinji 
looked at herself as well, raising a brow at the state of her clothes 
and her body.  Her black clothes were slashed in many places and rather 
saturated with diluted blood.  She was also a tad muddy from lying on 
the riverbank for a day.  She sighed and pushed her hand through her 
hair.

&quot;Damn,&quot; she grumbled.  &quot;I hate getting this dirty.  I&#39;ll scrub your back 
if you get mine.&quot;  Hikari blushed a crimson that would rival Vandemon&#39;s 
Bloody Stream attack.  She knew exactly why she was blushing, however.  
It was not the idea of nakedness with another woman.  It was simply 
being naked with Shinji-who would also be in the nude-that was setting 
her blood aflame.  Shinji noticed her blush and let out a faint sigh.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; she sighed.  &quot;That was stupid of me.  Go ahead and take a bath 
first, I can wait.&quot;  Hikari shook her head, willing her blood to calm 
down and leave her cheeks.

&quot;No, it&#39;s all right,&quot; she said, grateful that her voice was not breaking 
as her heart started to thump against her ribcage.  &quot;I shouldn&#39;t make 
you stay so dirty.  I think we can take a bath together without me dying 
of a nosebleed.&quot;  Shinji blinked in surprise at the statement.  &quot;Oh, 
dammit, no-I&#39;m not being perverted-that came out wrong!&quot;  Shinji&#39;s lips 
quirked at those words as well.  &quot;No, no, no!  Stop it-I&#39;m not trying to 
say things like that!  Oh, gods.&quot;  Shinji put her hands on Hikari&#39;s 
shoulders and kissed her firmly.  Hikari let out a sigh after this, a 
smile appearing on her face.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Shinji said with amusement ringing in her voice.  She led 
Hikari to the bathroom.  The two shed their clothes, Shinji tossing her 
bloody and shredded clothing into a bin near the sink, and Hikari 
placing the uniform into a wicker laundry basket by the bath&#39;s door.  
Hikari let out a faint sigh before stepping into the second room.

&quot;I envied you for having such a nice house,&quot; she explained.  &quot;But now I 
get to share it with you.&quot;  Shinji smiled at her and pushed her forwards 
towards the other room.  Out of lingering embarrassment and modesty, 
Hikari neither turned fully towards Shinji nor did she look at Shinji 
full on.  The two shared shampoo and soap and quickly cleaned 
themselves.  Hikari gave a start when she saw red flowing into the drain 
in the floor, but remembered that Shinji was probably coated in dried 
blood.  After a few minutes, Hikari swallowed and turned a shade deeper 
red than the natural blush the water&#39;s warmth and the room&#39;s steam 
caused.

&quot;Shinji,&quot; she said.  &quot;Could you...wash my back, please?&quot;  She held the 
damp cloth over her shoulder and waited rather anxiously for Shinji to 
answer.  Shinji said nothing, but took the cloth and sat the girl down 
on the stool.  She began to scrub Hikari&#39;s back gently, one hand bracing 
the smaller girl by the shoulder.  Hikari wasn&#39;t sure if she was 
remembering to breathe or not.  The calluses on Shinji&#39;s hands weren&#39;t 
unpleasant, but a different sensation than Hikari had known before.

Her long fingers curved over Hikari&#39;s shoulder, brushing against the 
girl&#39;s collarbone on occasion and causing a small burst of sparks on 
Hikari&#39;s skin.  Hikari stared rather determinedly at the floor, biting 
her lip when she saw a drop of red fall away from her own face.  She 
suddenly stopped thinking about trying to stop her nose from bleeding 
her to death and her mind was immediately flooded with multiple 
scenarios and things that she realized she wanted to do with Shinji.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Hikari said.  &quot;Shinji, if you want, I&#39;ll wash your back 
now.&quot;  Shinji&#39;s hands froze.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;It&#39;s all right.&quot;  To Hikari&#39;s 
amazement, Shinji sounded slightly embarrassed and ashamed.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Hikari asked.  The hand that Shinji had on her shoulder 
twitched.

&quot;I just...I have a lot of scars,&quot; Shinji almost whispered.  &quot;I doubt you 
want to see them.&quot;

&quot;Shinji, it&#39;s all right,&quot; Hikari said reassuringly.  &quot;I&#39;ve seen scars 
before.&quot;

&quot;Small lines, like this,&quot; Shinji sighed, trailing her fingernail on 
Hikari&#39;s shoulder in an example.  &quot;Most of the scars are from the 
Digital World.  Vandemon explained to me that the scars won&#39;t heal as 
properly as they would if I got them from fighting my father or 
accidentally cutting myself with a shuriken.  It&#39;s like the data was 
lost from my body.&quot;

&quot;Shinji,&quot; Hikari said firmly.  &quot;It&#39;s all right.  I&#39;m sure that your back 
needs a good wash.  Just sit down here and give me that washcloth.&quot;  
With little else to do, Shinji relinquished the cloth and sat on the 
stool that Hikari had just vacated.  Hikari turned and knelt down, 
pausing involuntarily at the sight of Shinji&#39;s back.  Her skin held a 
plethora of scars, just as Shinji had said.  There were faded lines-from 
sword fights with her father, Hikari wondered-and many gashes that 
hadn&#39;t healed together but sank into Shinji&#39;s body with the white scar 
tissue glaring at Hikari.

Dried blood was all around many of these gashes, the most recent of the 
injuries Shinji attained to save Hikari&#39;s life.  Hikari dipped the cloth 
into the wooden bucket of water and laid it on Shinji&#39;s back.  Shinji 
tensed without making a sound; her body was still pained by the 
injuries.  It was obvious the healing was only superficial and barely 
more than closing Shinji&#39;s skin to prevent her death by blood loss.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Hikari whispered.  She gently started to dab at the blood, 
pausing whenever she felt Shinji tense under her hands.  After many 
minutes and multiple dips into the water for the cloth, the blood was 
cleaned away.  Hikari let out a soft sigh, smiling as she dropped the 
cloth into the bucket.

&quot;All done,&quot; she said.  &quot;You should have a good long soak.  It&#39;ll make 
you feel better after such a beating.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; Shinji murmured.  Hikari raised a brow.

&quot;Why not?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Because if I move, I&#39;m not going to be able to keep from tackling you 
to the floor and having my way with you.&quot;  Hikari blushed brightly.  
After a moment, she closed her eyes and smiled.

&quot;Who said that&#39;s so bad?&quot;  Hikari had barely finished her final word 
before Shinji had turned about and pulled Hikari to her.  She kissed 
Hikari deeply, pressing her tongue into the other young woman&#39;s mouth.  
One arm was wrapped tightly around Hikari and the other hand was cupped 
on Hikari&#39;s cheek.  Hikari let out a moan into Shinji&#39;s mouth, wrapping 
her arms around Shinji&#39;s neck.  Shinji stood her up and led her out of 
the bathroom, up a flight of stairs, and into a bedroom.

This was, without a doubt, the most electric and erotic thing Hikari had 
ever experienced in her life.  She had never been in any kind of 
relationship before, had never been touched by anyone, and rarely 
touched herself.  Now, as Shinji pushed her gently onto the soft bed and 
her long-fingered hands slid towards Hikari&#39;s breasts, Hikari only 
wanted for Shinji to touch her everywhere.

Shinji sighed against Hikari&#39;s neck, kissing her skin slightly, over and 
over.  She ran her hands along the young woman&#39;s sides, fingers fitting 
in Hikari&#39;s ribs as if they were molded for one another.  Hikari let out 
a wavering moan as Shinji&#39;s hand closed gently around one of her 
breasts.  The tenderness of Shinji&#39;s touch was exquisite.  Her hands 
were a mix of calluses from handling weapons and the natural softness of 
a woman&#39;s flesh and made for a wonderful sensation on Hikari&#39;s breasts.

One hand slid away from her breast down towards her legs.  Her lips 
moved from Hikari&#39;s neck to suckle at the now unattended and hardened 
nipple.  Hikari moaned, tossing her head back and arching her back 
towards Shinji&#39;s touch.  Her own hands slid into Shinji&#39;s damp brown 
hair, twitching with each moan that she let out.  Shinji&#39;s wandering 
hand slipped between Hikari&#39;s legs, her fingers rubbing at the young 
woman&#39;s clit.  Hikari jumped with a loud moan at the burst of pleasure.  
Shinji smiled, detaching her lips from Hikari&#39;s nipple with a small pop.

&quot;Shinji, what are you-oh, my god,&quot; Hikari whispered.  Shinji moved 
lower, flashing a heated glance at Hikari before pushing her legs apart 
and lying down between them.  Her fingers played with the wet, slick 
skin and again massaged Hikari&#39;s clit.  Shinji pressed her tongue hard 
on the nub, causing Hikari to gasp and jerk her legs together.  With a 
patient smile, Shinji spread the other young woman&#39;s legs again and 
moved closer.  She pressed her tongue against the soft, wet, hot folds 
of Hikari&#39;s skin, easily holding the other woman&#39;s legs open even when 
she jerked with another moan.

She lapped at Hikari for a few minutes, her hands caressing the woman&#39;s 
thighs as Hikari quaked from the pleasure spreading through her body.  
Hikari moaned, her hands clenched tightly in the bed sheets and her eyes 
closed just as tightly.  Her breath hitched when she came, her body 
seizing up before trembling worse than before.  She panted, trying to 
open her eyes again, to say something to Shinji.

As she panted, she felt Shinji&#39;s lips press gently on her cheek, kissing 
away the sudden tenseness that had built up in her body.  She found the 
strength to open her eyes and look at her lover.  The moment she saw 
Shinji&#39;s blue eyes, Hikari was taken aback.  Shinji&#39;s eyes were 
smoldering with the emotions she had never been allowed to show.  All 
the love she felt for Hikari was so visible in her gaze that she never 
would have needed to say another word.

&quot;Shinji, you-I...I love you so much,&quot; Hikari whispered, tears welling 
over in her burgundy eyes.  She wrapped her arms around Shinji&#39;s neck, 
pulling her close.  Shinji draped her long arms around Hikari in return, 
letting Hikari cry softly on her shoulder.  However, when Hikari kissed 
her fiercely, Shinji slipped two fingers over the woman&#39;s lips to stop 
her.  She gave her a sad smile.

&quot;You have no idea how much I want to let you do what you&#39;re thinking 
about, but I can&#39;t,&quot; Shinji murmured.

&quot;Why not?&quot; Hikari asked, her voice still tremulous.

&quot;I&#39;ve been injured too many times to not know what would happen if my 
heart beats too hard,&quot; Shinji replied.  &quot;My wounds would reopen.  Don&#39;t 
worry, Hikari-I&#39;m not going anywhere.&quot;  She kissed Hikari once more, 
pulling the blanket of the bed over them.  Hikari felt warm weariness 
pulling at her limbs, gladly closing her eyes and settling against 
Shinji as sleep took them both.
