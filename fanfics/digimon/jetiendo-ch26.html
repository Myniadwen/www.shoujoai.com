<h1>Jetiendo (part 26 of 38)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../digimon/jetiendo-ch25.html">Back to Part 25</a><pre>Ant and Dec sniggered as the class came in.

&quot; Ant you are harsh&quot; Dec whispered to Ant

&quot; Teach them too steal my magazines&quot; Ant hissed &quot; sit down please&quot;

&quot;Now Dec &quot; smiled &quot;Ant and I decided that we have been absolutely harsh 
to Davis. Raise your hand if you agree&quot;

Davis was the only person who raised his hand. &quot;Oh, we had a good plan 
for the lesson today, I&#39;ll get the algebra.&quot;

&quot;No&quot; Ant roared, &quot;We can still patronise someone else&quot;

&quot;Infact why don&#39;t we embarrass two people, one boy, and one girl&quot; Dec 
hissed

&quot;KARI KAMIYA&quot; roared Ant &quot;STAND UP&quot;

&quot;T.K STAND UP IS WELL&quot; Dec boomed.

&quot;CLASS I HAVE SOME GREAT GOSSIP FOR YOU ALL&quot; Ant announced &quot;THESE TWO 
HAD SEX LAST NIGHT IN SIMON COWELL&#39;S SECRET MANSION AND AT BREAK TIME IN 
THE GIRL&#39;S TOILETS&quot;

&quot;Did you really?&quot; Dec asked in shock&quot; what&#39;s his house like?&quot;

The class was laughing at them both, Ant and Dec broke their promise, 
and then there was a knock on a door, Postman Pat and his black and 
white cat.

&quot;Good morning Ant and Dec&quot; Postman Pat said &quot; I got some post for you&quot; 
he passed the post to Ant

&quot; Thank you&quot; Ant replied

&quot;Hold on&quot; Dec said &quot;I want you to deliver these too&quot; Dec skipped to the 
cupboard and hold loads of books The seven books of Harry Potter, plus 
seven quiz books and a note he placed it in a huge box &quot;deliver this to 
Ash and May this is their work for the whole of this week he is to send 
it once they have finished.&quot; Dec said

&quot; I&#39;ll make sure they get it&quot; Pat announced

&quot;Postman&quot; Ant called out with giggles on his face &quot; those two had sex 
last night and stole my porn magazines&quot; he laughed Postman Pat took no 
notice &quot;goodbye &quot; Pat said.

&quot;You can all mess around&quot; Dec announced.

Any class would obey that rule, being allowed to mess around, do what 
they pleased. The free five minutes, it was all so perfect only one 
person could ruin this if he had the chance that now. Mr Grinal. But 
he&#39;s dead.

Meanwhile at the hospital, Brock stared at Max, he wasn&#39;t even allowed 
to step into the room, Brock was devastated. Then Shelito Paz and 
Angelica proudly walked so happy, they where gold. Angelica glared and 
laughed at Brock as if he was a television and something really stupid 
happened on the telly. Shelito took matters into his own hand

&quot; Monkey&quot; announced Paz pointing at Brock. &quot;Look at that disgusting 
nigger, skin full off dirt, pure dirt, nigger, wog. Go back to Africa, 
or the witchcraft tribe where you belong&quot;

Paz&#39;s boring stale face became a snigger of a smile, as he was at 
Brock&#39;s face he spat on it. Paz left in a cold manner.

Angelica stood there with her arms around Brock. Her smooth hands 
swifting his tears and Paz&#39;s salvia

&quot;Don&#39;t worry&quot; whispered Angelica luring Brock into a private room. &quot;How 
about lunch&quot; Angelica hissed. &quot;Then spend the night at a hotel room. 
Sex. Love. Romance. Dancing in the moonlight.&quot;

Brock&#39;s heart melted &quot;sure&quot; he whispered. Angelica had a new boyfriend. 
Brock thought it was love. Angelica was only up for a new challenge. She 
wanted sex. She had Brock just where she wanted him to be, his heart was 
her prize possession. Their lips moved like magnets.

&quot;Disgusting&quot; roared Paz from a distance.
