<h1>Dark Guardian: A Tale of Rika and Renamon (part 3 of 12)</h1>

<a href="../digimon/darkguard-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Renamon knelt in the shadowed bedroom, watching Lady Rika sleep. 
Thankfully, the kitsune only needed to sleep an hour or so herself, 
leaving her awake to guard her Lady through the night. The young 
noblewoman seemed to be one thing during the day, so strong, capable 
and confident, but at night she returned to being the young woman that 
she really was.

&quot;Mph,&quot; Rika&#39;s hands grabbed at the cloth blanket over her, a frown on 
her sleeping face. &quot;No,&quot; she murmured softly to whatever dream haunted 
her, &quot;don&#39;t leave me alone...&quot;

Watching the girl twisting and turning in her sleep, Renamon sat down 
at the side of the bed, reaching out and gently stroking the side of 
Rika&#39;s face. It seemed to comfort the teen for a moment, but once 
Renamon removed her hand Rika&#39;s sleep became restless once again.

&#39;She needs her sleep,&#39; Renamon looked down at Rika worriedly, &#39;each 
day she works herself to exhaustion.&#39; Not letting herself think about 
what she was about to do, Renamon lay down on top of the covers beside 
Rika, gently circling her with her arms.

Rika curled into Renamon, snuggling closely, and her sleep soon 
quieted. The girl&#39;s breathing became steady once again, and her face 
relaxed into childlike pleasure as she fell into a deeper sleep. Wide 
awake Renamon watched her, wondering about this woman who was quickly 
becoming the focus of her very life.

Renamon gazed down at her until the sun began to rise, only slipping 
free of Rika&#39;s grip once the first rays of sunlight began to fill the 
room. She padded out of the room quietly, softly asking one of the 
maids to prepare a breakfast for the lady.

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; the pretty young woman squeaked respectfully.

&quot;I have no title,&quot; Renamon paused to say to her gently, &quot;I am but a 
commoner like you.&quot;

The girl looked up at her wide eyed, &quot;You may have no title, but you 
are certainly not common!&quot; With that, she was gone.

Renamon smiled ruefully, &#39;I suppose she has a point.&#39;

Rika stumbled out of her bedroom only a few moments later, a tuffs of 
her red hair sticking up messily. &quot;G&#39;d morning,&quot; she mumbled softly. 
She splashed her face with cold water from a basin, gasping softly at 
the chill.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Renamon had to smile. She wondered if anyone else got 
to see Rika like this, with her guard so clearly down.

Rika sat down at her dressing table, brushing the unruly tuffs of hair 
down, softly cursing when she occasionally hit a snag. &quot;I&#39;m going out 
into the city today,&quot; she said to Renamon, &quot;will that be a problem?&quot;

&#39;And she can swear just like a sailor,&#39; Renamon noted that ability 
with some amusement. &quot;When you go out would you like me to follow you 
as I am,&quot; Renamon asked her, &quot;or should I try to blend in with the 
crowd?&quot;

Rika looked up at her oddly and asked Renamon, &quot;How does a six foot 
tall fox-woman blend in with a crowd?&quot;

&quot;Very easily,&quot; Renamon smiled. She called on her transformation 
ability, light shimmering around her as she shrank, becoming one of 
the maids. In a perfect imitation of the serving girl&#39;s voice she 
asked, &quot;How may I serve you?&quot;

Rika clapped involuntarily, &quot;Incredible!&quot; There was something slightly 
off, though, and Rika finally pointed, &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;My tail,&quot; Renamon shrugged, the long, bushy tail swishing against her 
legs, &quot;it&#39;s the only part of me that I can&#39;t seem to change.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Rika nodded thoughtfully, then she asked Renamon, &quot;Is there a 
human form that you prefer to take?&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Renamon blinked, looking confused.

&quot;A human form that you consider your own,&quot; Rika said, but Renamon 
still looked at her uncomprehending. &quot;When I close my eyes and hear 
you speak,&quot; Rika said quietly, &quot;I see a tall young woman, with short 
hair the color of your fur, athletic, and a little smile.&quot;

Renamon let the maid&#39;s form disolve, quickly returning to her kitsune 
form. &quot;I&#39;ll have to think about it,&quot; she smiled down at Rika gently.

Later that morning they went to hold court, and Rika felt a bit of 
amusement at the continued nervousness of all the nobles around 
Renamon. There were only a few petitions, easily handled, and the 
nobles were careful to be truly respectful in their choice of words.

&#39;They certainly know what will happen to them if they are not,&#39; Rika 
thought to herself happily. A noble had been quite disrespectful to 
her a few days ago, and Renamon had moved like a shot. She had picked 
the man up by the throat, and even though Rika quickly called Renamon 
off, she felt such a burst of satisfaction from it!

&#39;I don&#39;t think I have ever had someone stand up for me that way,&#39; Rika 
thought as they walked out of the castle. Renamon had become a 
comforting shadow to her over the weeks since she had arrived, but 
still remained such a mystery to her. She hadn&#39;t even known about 
Renamon&#39;s ability to change her form until today!

Rika blushed softly, thinking of what she had said to Renamon, about 
the way she saw her. &#39;I can&#39;t believe I told her that,&#39; she thought, 
&#39;I all but called her handsome.&#39; The streets were crowded as they 
walked together, Renamon staying close but giving her a bit of room.

&quot;I will return,&quot; Renamon murmured, and was gone.

Rika blinked, looking around wildly. &#39;Where did she...&#39; she wondered, 
when a gentle hand rested on her shoulder.

The woman was dressed in a simple brown tunic and a long skirt, her 
orange-gold hair falling just slightly into her eyes. Eyes that were 
so very familiar to Rika. A little smile quirked her lips as Renamon 
asked, &quot;How do I look?&quot;

&quot;Just... as I had imagined,&quot; Rika managed to get out.

&quot;Good,&quot; and Renamon&#39;s smile grew a bit broader. Renamon gestured Rika 
forward as she murmured softly, &quot;Ladies first.&quot;

With a little nod Rika said, &quot;Thank you.&quot; Outwardly Rika maintained 
her cool, but inside she felt her heart skip a beat. &#39;She&#39;s better 
looking than I imagined,&#39; Rika admitted to herself ruefully, &#39;this may 
not have been such a good idea.&#39;

Despite the different appearance, Renamon still moved like her old 
self. She guarded Rika, not just with her stance but even with the 
intensity of her glare. She always stood protectively at Rika&#39;s side, 
and a question began to rise in Rika&#39;s mind.

&#39;Is she protecting me as a bodyguard,&#39; Rika wondered, &#39;or as a 
friend?&#39;

&quot;Have you eaten since breakfast?&quot; Renamon asked softly.

Rika turned to answer, expecting to see the fox face and felt mildly 
shaken by the handsome human form beside her. &quot;No, I haven&#39;t,&quot; she 
said quietly.

&quot;Then let&#39;s get some lunch,&quot; Renaom took Rika&#39;s elbow and gently 
guided her over to a noodle stand nearby. She ordered two bowls, 
pausing a moment to sniff at each bowl and examine the chop sticks. 
&quot;They&#39;re fine,&quot; Renamon murmured softly, setting the bowl in front of 
Rika.

&#39;Checking them for poison,&#39; Rika realized. She settled down in her 
seat, looked up and nearly laughed aloud.

Renamon was slurping her noodles, clearly enjoying the food. She saw 
the look Rika was giving her and chuckled, &quot;I&#39;ve seen you eat them the 
same way, Rika.&quot;

Rika felt warm, and realized this was the first time that Renamon had 
called her by her first name...
