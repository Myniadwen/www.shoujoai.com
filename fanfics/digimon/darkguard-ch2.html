<h1>Dark Guardian: A Tale of Rika and Renamon (part 2 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../digimon/darkguard-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Lady Rika opened the side door, the red haired woman stepping out into 
the view of the eyes of the lords and ladies of court. Dressed in her 
typically simple garb, she took a few steps to reach the simple chair 
that she dealt with the court&#39;s business and sat down.

Standing hidden in the deep shadows behind her, Renamon watched. She 
scanned the crowd and carefully memorized the faces of the men and 
women who showed any surprise on seeing Rika alive, scowling or 
frowning furiously. They at least knew about the plot to slay the 
lady, even if they were not involved themselves.

Rika smoothly ran through the business of the day, then she rose from 
her seat. &quot;I would also like to make an announcement,&quot; she smiled, 
eyes glittering dangerously. &quot;I have recently retained a bodyguard to 
protect me, as I have become aware of certain people who seem to wish 
me harm,&quot; she said, pretending to be mournful.

As they had planned Renamon released the shadows and stepped up beside 
Rika. &quot;My name is Renamon,&quot; the fox woman declared, fixing the room 
with a deadly gaze, &quot;and any who threaten my Lady will not live long 
enough to boast of it.&quot;

Rika had to fight back a grin. &#39;That certainly stirred them up,&#39; she 
thought.

&quot;My Lady,&quot; her vizier Rio blurted, &quot;why wasn&#39;t I informed?&quot;

&quot;I chose her,&quot; Rika answered him simply before fixing him with a hard 
gaze, &quot;as is clearly my right, is it not, sirrah?&quot;

Rio blanched, stepping back, &quot;Of course, ma&#39;am!&quot;

&#39;Spineless toad,&#39; Renamon thought of him disdainfully, being careful 
to not let any of her thoughts appear on her face. She felt a bit of 
satisfaction as she saw the white faces of those who had been 
displeased at seeing Rika alive, and considered upping the pressure on 
them. &#39;No, not until I ask Rika,&#39; she decided.

&quot;If there are no petitions?&quot; Rika asked, looking down at the group of 
badly shaken nobles before her. Not a one spoke up, and Rika nodded, 
&quot;Then I shall return tomorrow, to hear the words of the noble born 
once again.&quot;

Rika rose and walked back to the side door, Renamon shadowing her 
carefully. Renamon opened up the door to look inside, then gestured 
Rika in before following her inside. As the door shut Renamon 
murmured, &quot;A few were clearly surprised to see you still living.&quot;

&quot;Can you describe them?&quot; Rika asked quietly as they started down the 
halls to Rika&#39;s chambers. Renamon&#39;s eyes scanned the hallway, seeking 
into darkest shadows for any sign of movement, any sign at all.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Renamon sounded amused at the very question. &quot;I learned 
to memorize faces back when I was merely a cub,&quot; she added. She 
described the two men and one woman, and Rika nodded thoughtfully.

&quot;I know of whom you speak,&quot; Rika sighed, &quot;they are simply followers. 
They saw an opportunity for advancement, and now that it has failed 
they will merely run and hide.&quot;

Renamon nodded thoughtfully, having made much the same assessment. 
&quot;The one who hired the Guild, Lord Takato, is a greater threat,&quot; she 
noted. They reached Rika&#39;s chambers, where Renamon opened the door and 
gazed in cautiously before waving Rika inside.

&quot;Is this really necessary?&quot; Rika asked her softly.

&quot;I was able to slip in,&quot; Renamon smiled slightly, pacing through the 
three connected rooms, &quot;it&#39;s safest to assume others can.&quot;

Renamon gave Rika the all clear, and the young woman followed her in. 
&#39;She moves so gracefully,&#39; Rika found herself noticing, &#39;not at all 
like me.&#39;

Rika sat on the side of her bed with a relieved sigh, and Renamon&#39;s 
lips twitched with a smile. &#39;She&#39;s so young,&#39; Renamon thought, &#39;to be 
bearing the duties that she does.&#39; Quietly, she asked Rika &quot;What can 
you tell me of this Lord Takato?&quot;

&quot;He is a distant relative of mine,&quot; Rika said to Renamon, &quot;who also 
sought the leadership of my people. When his petition was denied by 
the high council, he was quite angry but seemed to accept their 
decision.&quot;

&quot;Obviously he hid his true intentions,&quot; Renamon noted. The tall 
kitsune moved restlessly, occasionally standing by the frosted window 
to look out at the blurred shapes.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Rika nodded. She looked thoughtful, &quot;I know little of his true 
character, but from what I have heard he is less than trustworthy.&quot;

&quot;Those that hire the Guild,&quot; Renamon noted, &quot;are rarely willing to act 
for themselves. As long as I can protect you from the assassins, you 
should be fine.&quot;

Rika nodded, &quot;But I&#39;d still like to catch him at something.&quot;

&quot;Patience,&quot; Renamon smiled slightly. Her eyes narrowed slightly, her 
body tensing. &quot;Stay here,&quot; she said softly, &quot;you&#39;ll be safe.&quot;

With that, Renamon simply seemed to disappear.

&quot;Wait,&quot; Rika started, then shook her head.

Renamon dropped down to the rooftop, looking around calmly. Simply she 
said, &quot;It&#39;s been a long time, Lady Devimon.&quot;

The black clad figure seemed to appear from the shadows, a long, 
ragged black cape fluttering all around her. Her pale, attractive face 
was masked, and a set of metallic talons were attached to one of her 
hands. Her voice, however, was as smooth as silk as she said, &quot;If 
you&#39;d just kill her, lover, the Guild would take you back.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t do that,&quot; Renamon answered softly, the muscles of her body 
coiled and ready for whatever might come.

&quot;As you wish,&quot; Lady Devimon shrugged sadly, then she became a blur. 
She struck like a snake, her talons gleaming as she tried to rake them 
across Renamon&#39;s belly.

But the Kitsune was gone.

Hovering in the air above Lady Devimon, Renamon began to fall, her paw 
like hands filled with small knives. She released them in a storm of 
glittering diamonds, there was a soft, pain filled cry, and it was all 
over.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Renamon murmured, looking down at the black clad woman 
and remembering a night that they had spent together, not all that 
long ago.

Renamon gently cradled the body in her arms, bounding from the castle 
roof to the village, then across fields of grass until she reached the 
forest. She lay the body down there, knowing that the guild would 
recover her, bury her with honor.

Moved like a blur she returned to Rika&#39;s rooms, the lady looking up 
joyfully at her return. Rika saw the look on Renamon&#39;s face and asked 
quietly, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

Renamon smiled sadly, &quot;I will be.&quot; She paused a moment, then &quot;They 
sent a... friend.&quot;
