<h1>Flowers (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/simsar.html">Simsar</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Note: So, this is my first fan fiction. It&#39;s going to take it 
slow, but the problems in all the relationships will show up as you 
read. It will end with Sora and Mimi you just have to be patient and 
watch the dominos get set up to fall.



The recycled air was getting dank with the smell of human sweat and just 
an overall order from being in a plane for 24 hours with over 100 
people. Mimi was glancing out the window into downtown Tokyo. It was 
Christmas Day now, she&#39;d set off on Christmas Eve. This trip back was 
for a reason and it certainly wasn&#39;t to come back to Japan for the 
holidays. It&#39;s because America, with all its beauty, didn&#39;t work out. 
She was there for 4 years, 4 whole years that were some of the best 
she&#39;d had, the digi-world not included. She still had Palmon in her lap 
and she still had her digi-vice not that it did much anymore, besides 
look good on a watch strap and tell the time.

Her gaze kept at the window, her eyes looking down at the metropolis. 
Maybe she&#39;d stay in a hotel till she could find a place to a live. She 
wished, her parents had ousted finally, she was 20 years old with zero 
direction in her life. She wanted to be a cook, she loved cooking, it 
made her happy but her parents didn&#39;t want to give her money to go cook 
citing it as a &quot;Terrible job&quot; and a &quot;Waste of time&quot;. After her parents 
gave her 5,000 U.S. Dollars and told her to go work her way through it, 
Mimi realized how hard life was. She lived off it for a month or so till 
she was down to twelve-hundred or so. With the last of it, she purchased 
a one way ticket to Tokyo, got herself a suitcase, packed the last of 
her stuff she didn&#39;t sell off to make due and headed back to her home.

Her gaze looked out across Tokyo; she was praying someone would be kind 
enough to let her stay with them till she was okay to support herself. 
Admittedly, the experience of all this, made her grow up. She was back 
to her natural hair color again, and she wasn&#39;t wearing those stupid mid 
drifts. She was dressed in a yellow sweater, her hair pulled back into a 
bun; she still had her thing about western looks and wore boots over her 
blue jeans. She shook her head and shut the blinds to the window and sat 
back, Palmon didn&#39;t move.

----

Tai planted his foot on the table, &quot;To us!&quot; Tai shouted. Izzy was on the 
couch; his face was redder than tomato. Tai was obviously just getting 
started on his drinking. One a night like tonight, when all his friends 
were over, he had every right to make a total fool of himself. Izzy 
looked at his bottle, it was his only one and he hadn&#39;t polished off 
even half of it. He loathed admitting it, but he wasn&#39;t a heavy weight 
when it came to drinking.

Everyone, who included, Sora and Matt who were happily engaged, Kari who 
was living with both Izzy and Tai and T.K. who&#39;d managed to pull Yolie 
away from her computer training for one evening. Joe was out at work, 
Cody was studying for law school and wouldn&#39;t be disturbed, and Davis 
who&#39;d been MIA since him and Veemon and the rest of the digimon, deemed 
they&#39;d be hanging in the Digital world for Christmas. The only one 
missing was Mimi. Not that anyone was missing her, she was in America, 
they were cool with that; she called them all the time so it&#39;s not like 
she just ditched them.

Their apartment, Tai and Izzy&#39;s, wasn&#39;t too messed up, but their 
furniture wasn&#39;t exactly tip top either. The table Tai planted his foot 
on to declare things like a conqueror, was an old thrown out piece of 
hardwood from a garage sale Tai got for 200 yen. The beer they got was 
from a discount liquor store just down the street and the T.V. 
broadcasting &#39;It&#39;s a Wonderful Life&#39; was Izzy&#39;s T.V. that his mom let 
him take because she couldn&#39;t work the remote in the first place.

----

Mimi set down on the ground, twenty minutes later. She&#39;d brightened up a 
bit, especially after Palmon told her that everything would work out. 
Mimi carried Palmon and her carry-on bag out of the plane and to the 
exit. Her first order of business was to find someone she knew.

In America, she learned, despite the tiny print and the misinformation, 
the Phonebook was always the way to go. Unfortunately, there were three 
full volumes, and her Japanese was a tad rusty. The only person she 
could find was Izzy. Mainly cause Izzy was the only one who somehow 
managed to keep in contact with her through e-mail and told her his 
Address. She didn&#39;t think that information useful till right now.

She copied the address down and made her way outside to the wind chilled 
air. She hugged Palmon around her waste, letting Palmon grip the handle 
of the bag as she carried her. The lone Taxi outside sat there waiting 
for her like a sign. She strolled towards it, opened the door and sat 
down; she set her bag against the back seat.

&quot;Where to Miss?&quot;

Mimi gave him the address, he shifted the Taxi in gear and the two 
shuttled off towards the inner city.

----

Tai, after talking for several minutes had finally turned blue in the 
face and hit the chair behind him. His fourth beer went rolling across 
the floor from his hand. Matt and Sora were cuddling in the love seat; 
T.K., Kari and Yolie were all talking about school. Izzy kept holding 
his bottle, despite the buzz, he was marveling at the smoothness of the 
edges.

&quot;Issy...&quot; Tai muttered, &quot;How did you and mee strike out?&quot; Izzy eyed the 
glass, he looked at Tai, &quot;I think you need to take a break bud.&quot;

Tai pointed at Izzy and nodded, he tilted his head back and went limp. 
Izzy shrugged and went back to looking at the bottle. Matt and Sora were 
still cuddling and whispering stuff to each other.

&quot;So you wanna bail yet Babe?&quot; Matt asked.

&quot;Nah, I haven&#39;t been around these screw balls in a couple months, can&#39;t 
you enjoy their company?&quot; Sora pleaded.

&quot;Why?&quot; Matt asked, &quot;I mean, Tai is out of work, again. Izzy is pulling 
down enough to probably pay for a house by now. You and I are doing 
great, we&#39;ve sold that design to a major retailer and we&#39;re getting a 
good chunk.&quot;

&quot;Matt, these are our friends. I mean, seriously, they&#39;re not that bad.&quot; 
Sora replied defending her friends.

Matt sighed and got up off the loveseat leaving Sora sitting there. He 
shut the bathroom door and left Sora shaking her head and rolling her 
eyes. Meanwhile, Tai was lying on his back over the arm looking at the 
ceiling, he was awake but he was too drunk to say a word. Sora looked at 
Tai; sometimes she wished he&#39;d finally take the initiative instead of 
letting Matt sweep her off her feet. She loved the retard, he made her 
laugh.

The knock on the door drew the whole room&#39;s attention like a magnet.

----

Mimi sat at the door; Palmon was right next to her shivering like a leaf 
in the wind, no pun intended. She hoped she didn&#39;t wake anyone up, it 
was late after all and it was Christmas after all.

----

Izzy, was up and walking towards the door. Sora and the rest were 
following him with their eyes as he made his way to the door. He pushed 
the latch down and opened the door, his eyebrow raised. Well damn.

&quot;Hey Mimi.&quot;

Sora said her name without speaking, &quot;Mimi!&quot; She said in surprise.

She hoped from her seat and rushed over to the door. T.K., Yolie and 
Kari all had stunned looks on their faces. Tai was still lying on his 
back with no words coming from him still.

Mimi smiled softly; Palmon was shivering and thus spoke &quot;Can we come 
in?&quot;

Izzy scoffed, &quot;Is that a question? C&#39;mon in.&quot;

Palmon rushed in leaving Mimi standing on the door step. Izzy motioned 
for her to get in and Mimi stepped into the warm apartment. The smell of 
alcohol was prevalent and the overall busted state of the apartment was 
strange indeed. Izzy told her he was pulling down a lot of money fixing 
and networking for a couple major companies.

She smiled at Tai who was still looking like he usually did, stupid. She 
sat down in a chair across the couch from Izzy.

&quot;Hey Mimi...&quot; Here is comes, Mimi thought, &quot;I thought you were in 
America?&quot;

Tell them the truth or lie till its true? Such a hard choice. They were 
her friends and they&#39;d understand. She was back for good, no more 
tripping; she just needed a place to stay is all; just a place to crash 
and get her bearings while she worked for a job.

Matt opened the door to the bathroom; his gaze was totally different 
from the rather Semi-Happy Matt she remembered. He was serious now, less 
rebellious and more tempered than before. Something was totally 
different. Sora of course was smiling at her, she&#39;d been best friends 
with Sora since kindergarten, and it was some fond memories. Their 
secret crushes; they&#39;re stupid tales of girlhood, their ideas on true 
love.

Mimi bit her lower lip, &quot;Yeah, I was.&quot;

&quot;Hah. So you back for the rest of the Holiday or what?&quot; T.K. asked.

&quot;Permanently I guess.&quot; Mimi answered, in a mild dark tone.

&quot;Wow, bummer. What happened?&quot; T.K. probed.

&quot;Eh, my Parents basically didn&#39;t support my idea for College and told me 
to make it out on my own.&quot; Mimi answered.

Matt raised an eyebrow, &quot;Your parents spoiled you rotten though.&quot; He 
said bluntly.

&quot;Well, they got tired of it. Said I needed to grow up.&quot; Mimi replied.

&quot;Harsh.&quot; T.K. and Matt replied in tandem, proving despite Matt&#39;s look, 
he was still related to someone in the room in one way or another.

&quot;So, anyone think they can put up with me for a while till I find a job 
to make ends meet with?&quot; Mimi asked.

Matt crossed his arms, T.K. and Kari looked at each other, and Yolie 
looked at the ground. Great, no place at all &quot;You can crash here for a 
while, Mimi.&quot; Izzy answered, &quot;No trouble.&quot;

The room gave a small sigh of relief; Mimi included. Izzy always proved 
he had the heart of gold. Palmon jumped on Izzy&#39;s chest and kissed him. 
Izzy&#39;s eyes widened to the whites.

&quot;Okay, okay!&quot; Izzy replied, &quot;I get it.&quot;

----

It was well into the single digits of the morning when everyone finally 
left back to their humble abodes. Yolie was the last one to leave, 
having caught up with everything having to do with Mimi. Izzy shut the 
door finally. Mimi helped him clean up and move Tai to his room which 
was the true definition of Pig Sty. After packing him in for the next 
morning&#39;s hangover, Izzy and Mimi sat down and talked.

Izzy understood it all. He told her why the apartment wasn&#39;t exactly in 
perfect shape with all the modern enjoyments. Despite his good pay and 
earnings, he lived like a monk, choosing to set an account up in both 
his and Tai&#39;s name. Even though Tai pulled it ass when it came to 
income, he loved Tai like a big brother and simply throwing Tai to the 
dogs wasn&#39;t right. Mimi cried a few times, especially at what she had to 
do to survive. Again Izzy played the confession for her, patting her on 
the back, giving her advice.

Izzy set her up on the couch till they could figure out a bed for her. 
She got two blankets and a soft pillow. Izzy hit the light, shut the 
door to his room and left Mimi is silence. She&#39;d cried herself out, 
Palmon was sleeping next to her for the most part and she knew a sob 
would wake her friend up. So she lay there and was just happy to have a 
place to stay finally.

---

Sora walked back into the house, Matt was strumming his guitar while 
looking at some of the designs for the clothes. She was quiet the whole 
ride home and that made for a very quiet Car, especially with Matt being 
the silent type in the first place. She sat down and did her flower 
arranging for a minute, she needed to clear her head and get a grip, 
Mimi showing back up had hit her with a wave of nostalgia like none 
other.

&quot;You miss the old days Matt?&quot; Sora asked.

Matt looked up from the pictures with total disgust, &quot;Off and on. Mostly 
off.&quot;

Sora looked unconvinced, &quot;C&#39;mon, you were sour the whole night. You 
didn&#39;t even have one good memory? We saved the world and you can&#39;t call 
that a happy memory?&quot;

&quot;I call that a Memory, happy is up to interpretation.&quot; Matt replied, 
&quot;Seriously. Tai has become a total slacker and Izzy is just a tool. My 
brother is going to probably marry Tai&#39;s sister. Nothing sickens me more 
than watching Tai anymore.&quot;

&quot;Jeez Matt, you and Tai were friends. Just cause he&#39;s a slacker doesn&#39;t 
mean he&#39;s not worthy to talk with people.&quot; Sora answered.

&quot;Sora, I don&#39;t want to have this conversation okay. I&#39;m tired, I&#39;ve 
still got some work to do and I don&#39;t need you on my back.&quot;

Sora shook her head, a her lips pursed up, &quot;Fine.&quot; She snapped and 
walked into the bed room, &quot;You get the couch...&quot;
