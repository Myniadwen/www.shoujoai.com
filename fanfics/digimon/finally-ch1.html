<h1>Finally</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/patty.html">patty</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The door opened, revealing a tall, beautiful young woman, none other 
than her partner Mimi, dressed in small, black shorts and a pink tank 
top to match. Mimi placed the box she was carrying on the floor with 
caution not to hurt her back.

&quot;There are a few more things downstairs,&quot; she said with a smile that 
lit up the now undecorated room. 

&quot;I&#39;ll help you,&quot; Sora replied as she followed Mimi out of the room and 
down the stairs. She couldn&#39;t help but admire this other person who 
could always draw her attention by walking into a room, or simply 
smiling or laughing. The shorts Mimi wore were defiantly sexy, 
considering that they were so short and showed every curve in the 
perfect, long legs. 

&quot;You take this one,&quot; Mimi said as she pulled a box out the trunk of 
her pink sports car. &quot;I&#39;ll bring this other stuff.&quot; Mimi took her load 
as well, and made sure to lock the car door and trunk before finally 
bringing the boxes upstairs for unpacking.

&quot;Did we forget anything else?&quot; Sora asked her as Mimi entered the 
room.

&quot;No, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;Maybe we should unpack everything first before we start decorating.&quot;

&quot;Hmm&#133;. What about paint? We have to paint the walls, and if all our 
stuff is out they might get messed up.&quot;

&quot;I guess your right, but we don&#39;t have any paint yet.&quot;

&quot;Maybe we can get some of the painting done today, and finish it 
tomorrow. We can go now to get paint if you like.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re going to have to buy some furniture later this week as well.&quot;

&quot;I know, and I have a great idea for that! Look,&quot; Mimi said as she 
pulled out from her pocket a flyer for a new store called Pottery 
Barn. &quot;They have sale now since they just opened, and they have the 
best designs for great furniture.&quot; Sora took the flyer from Mimi&#39;s 
hand and examined it herself.

&quot;These are really nice.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know. I was more worried about the bedroom furniture and I 
picked out a few things I liked.&quot;

&quot;This is nice,&quot; Sora said, referring to a white dresser with mirror. 
&quot;Maybe we can stop there after we get paint.&quot; Mimi nodded her head in 
approval. 

&quot;Let&#39;s leave now while it&#39;s still early,&quot; Mimi said as she took Sora&#39;s 
hand in hers and practically dragged her out their new apartment. 

~*~

It wasn&#39;t the best thing to be excited and nervous at the same time, 
being excited to be moving in together with her girlfriend, yet 
nervous of what was supposed to happen later. She hid her nervousness 
well, and did a very good job of showing only the excitement as she 
and Sora decided on a paint color they both liked. But who wouldn&#39;t be 
nervous about something like this, making the big move out of her 
parents home, and moving in with someone she loved dearly with all her 
heart and soul? How was she supposed to act later? Was she supposed to 
hint that she wanted her and Sora to go further as they had been 
wanting to do for some time? Was she supposed to tell Sora that she 
wanted to wait until they got more comfortable around each other 
before going ahead? Or was Sora supposed to ask her? It was too 
confusing, and she didn&#39;t know what to do about it. Maybe it was a 
better idea to wait until later. 

&quot;Mimi, why aren&#39;t you paying attention?&quot;

&quot;Oh, huh?&quot;

&quot;Pastel, or blue?&quot;

&quot;Green,&quot; she replied incoherently, not realizing that Sora asked her 
Pastel or blue and not green.

&quot;Mimi, I didn&#39;t ask you about green. Pastel or blue?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I was just thinking&#133;.&quot;

&quot;About what?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s nothing. I just&#133;.&quot;

&quot;Mimi, if something&#39;s bothering you, you should tell me. If we&#39;re 
going to be living together now, we have to talk if something&#39;s 
bothering you or me.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not really important. It&#39;s nothing.&quot;

&quot;Mimi,&quot; Sora said as she took Mimi&#39;s hands in hers, &quot;You&#39;re important 
to me and so are your problems. I want to talk about them.&quot;

&quot;&#133; Okay, but not here.&quot;

Sora kept the paper samples of the different paint colors they had 
already chosen as they left the store and went upstairs to the food 
court.

&quot;Do you want anything to eat?&quot; Mimi asked her.

&quot;Sure. How about there,&quot; she replied, pointing to the Sandwich 
restaurant. Both women made their way there, and took seats in a 
corner so no one else would hear their conversation. Sora had no 
intention of ordering anything but had to do so to make the waitress 
leave them alone. 

Looking into Mimi&#39;s eyes, she waited for her to speak. She became 
lost, admiring Mimi&#39;s face, a moment later when Mimi still didn&#39;t say 
anything.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong,&quot; Sora managed to ask.

&quot;I was thinking ahead, and I know that we&#39;re going to have to go to 
sleep later tonight.&quot;

&quot;&#133; Okay&#133;.&quot;

&quot;Well, we have one bed and we know we&#39;re going to share because that&#39;s 
one reason we decided to move in together, to be together.&quot;

&quot;I understand where you&#39;re taking this.&quot;

&quot;You see, I don&#39;t know what to do. How are we supposed to tackle this? 
Are we supposed to just do it right after we get ready for bed, or 
what?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know. I was thinking the same thing.&quot;

&quot;You were?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sora replied, nodding her head. &quot;I&#39;ve been nervous since 
yesterday when I finished packing.&quot;

&quot;Well, what do we do then?&quot;

&quot;I guess wait until things turn out the way they were supposed to turn 
out. What do you think?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know. I thought you would know.&quot;

Just then, the same waitress came back with their lunch- a pastrami 
sandwich for Mimi, and a chicken one for Sora- and placed the 
sandwiches in front of both women. She soon left to deal with another 
customer.

&quot;Listen,&quot; said Sora, &quot;I love you, and I don&#39;t want to rush you if 
you&#39;re not ready yet. I can wait until we&#39;re both ready. I&#39;m sure you 
wouldn&#39;t want me to rush into anything I wasn&#39;t ready for either, 
right?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m completely ready yet either.&quot;

&quot;Fine, then. We&#39;ll wait until we&#39;re settled in before going any 
further,&quot; said Mimi.

&quot;Good.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad that we came to a fast conclusion. We work well together.&quot;

&quot;Of course we do,&quot; said Mimi. &quot;We belong together. We make the perfect 
couple.&quot;

&quot;Of course we do, or else we wouldn&#39;t have moved in together, and we 
wouldn&#39;t be sitting here now discussing this.&quot;

&quot;Sora, you always know when to say the right things to make me feel 
better.&quot;

&quot;Just being around you makes me feel more comfortable.&quot; Not caring who 
was looking, Mimi leaned over the table and planted her lips on 
Sora&#39;s.

&quot;What would we do without each other?&quot;

~*~

Later that day, and lots of paint later&#133;.

Both women were clad in old, raggedy clothes, working quietly at 
painting the living room the rosebud pastel color they had chosen. 
They had started the painting five hours earlier and were just about 
finished with it. Mimi tossed a miniature paintbrush into a bucket 
before stepping back to admire the room.

&quot;I think we did a good job, since it was our first time painting.&quot;

&quot;I agree,&quot; said Sora as she, too, put down her paintbrush. &quot;Tomorrow 
all we have to do is the kitchen, bathroom, and&#133; our room.&quot;

&quot;I think we should do our room first.&quot; Mimi closed the lid to the 
paint so she and Sora could start cleaning up. Little dabs of paint 
covered some areas of her legs and arms. Luckily, there was no paint 
in her hair. She knew that would have been impossible to get out.

&quot;Mimi?&quot; Sora said as she walked over to Mimi, an uncomfortable look 
painting her face. &quot;There&#39;s something I have to tell you.&quot;

&quot;Sora, what is it?&quot; Mimi asked, concerned that something was wrong 
with her love. 

&quot;Mimi, I&#39;m afraid that&#133;&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;That you&#39;ve got paint on your cheek,&quot; said Sora as she smiled and 
dabbed just a bit of paint on Mimi&#39;s rosy cheek. Mimi was not amused, 
she wasn&#39;t even glad that Sora was in a playful mood. Her skin was 
something that was not to be toyed with, and the fact the Sora messed 
up her face with paint was not a good thing.

&quot;Sora! How&#39;s that going to come off now?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s simple,&quot; she replied as she touched Mimi&#39;s arm with her paint 
infected hand. &quot;It&#39;s all just a matter of washing it off&#133; if it&#39;s 
washable, that is.&quot;

&quot;Sora, what&#39;s wrong with you? Stop touching me.&quot;

&quot;But Mimi, I thought you like it when I touched you. I love touching 
you with my lips,&quot; she said, as she kissed Mimi on the mouth, being 
careful not to taint any part of her girlfriend with the pastel, 
colored paint.

&quot;Mmm, I like that.&quot;

&quot;Of course you do. I knew you would. I also know you like this.&quot; More 
kisses made their way to the soft skin of Mimi&#39;s neck. And as Mimi 
moaned and purred at the sweet contact Sora remembered what it was 
like to shower the perfumed, scented neck with kisses until her love 
couldn&#39;t take it, yet begged her to continue. 

&quot;I know you like that,&quot; Sora said as she kissed Mimi once more on the 
lips and left to go wash the paint off her hands. After having their 
conversation earlier, she knew she shouldn&#39;t push things further too 
soon. She probably wasn&#39;t ready for that either.

Turning the water on, she added some soap and started rubbing the 
now-dried paint off her hands. She heard Mimi enter the bathroom, and 
ignored her so she could finish washing her hands. But Mimi had a way 
of drawing attention to herself, and one of those ways was by simply 
bothering someone until they were forced to turn around and pay 
attention to her. She didn&#39;t have to do such a thing to draw Sora&#39;s 
attention though. All Mimi had to do was kiss her unexpectedly on the 
back of her neck or sometimes on the shoulder as she was doing now. 

&quot;I know what you like too.&quot; 

Every kiss and caress was pleasurable; Mimi always had that effect on 
her. &quot;Mimi,&quot; she moaned as the girl sucked on the delicate skin before 
kissing over the area and choosing another spot. Sora turned around to 
face Mimi. She wanted to coat her love&#39;s face with her lips and did so 
as she held fast to Mimi&#39;s shoulders.

&quot;I&#39;m glad we decided to move in together,&quot; Mimi said between kisses.

&quot;I know,&quot; Sora replied though her lips were still smothered against 
Mimi&#39;s, breathing in the sweet scent the girl carried.

&quot;Maybe we should celebrate.&quot; Sora was too busy paying attention to 
Mimi&#39;s skillful technique to listen to what she was saying. Mimi knew 
where sensitive spots were, the ones that could make Sora loose track 
of what was happening in the room until all she could do was moan and 
beg Mimi to continue. She was feeling drowsy, sleepy and her knees 
were loosing balance as well. But Mimi held on to her, and continued 
showering her neck with kisses. Sora almost didn&#39;t realize when Mimi 
traveled lower and pushed the spaghetti strapped tank top to the side.

&quot;Mimi, what are you doing?&quot; She asked calmly. She wasn&#39;t expecting 
Mimi to do that after their conversation earlier.

&quot;Taking things as they come.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure?&quot;

&quot;Listen, just now when you kissed me in the other room, I realized how 
happy I am that we&#39;re together and how much I love you. I don&#39;t know 
what I&#39;d do without you. If something were to happen to you I wouldn&#39;t 
have had the chance to show you.&quot;

&quot;So you think we should go ahead?&quot;

&quot;If you want to.&quot; Instead of answering, Sora smiled and leaned in for 
another kiss, this time to Mimi&#39;s bare shoulder. 

&quot;Does that mean yes?&quot; Mimi asked.

Sora nodded her head slightly and took Mimi&#39;s hand, leading her out 
the bathroom and into their room. Pushing Mimi to sit down on the bed, 
Sora smiled at her because she almost couldn&#39;t believe that they were 
actually going to go this far so soon.

&quot;We can do anything here and no one would know,&quot; Mimi whispered, 
wrapping her arms around Sora&#39;s waist and resting her head against the 
stomach.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Sora replied, running her fingers through the chestnut 
hair. &quot;This is our place. We don&#39;t have to tell anyone what we do and 
don&#39;t do here unless we want to.&quot;

But Mimi stopped paying attention. She was tugging at Sora&#39;s shorts, 
motioning her to take them off.

&quot;Would you like to take them off, or should I?&quot; Mimi asked.

&quot;I can do it,&quot; Sora replied, stepping back to do what was necessary, 
pulling the tank top over her head and letting it drop to the floor, 
seductively. She didn&#39;t mean to undress so slowly, but the look on 
Mimi&#39;s face urged her to take it slow and tease Mimi.

&quot;This isn&#39;t strip tease.&quot;

&quot;Yes, but what&#39;s the point of rushing when we have the whole night?&quot; 
Mimi&#39;s face flushed crimson at her saying that. She had the sudden 
urge to grab Sora and pull the clothing off for her. She could only 
watch and become more aroused as Sora unzipped her shorts only to 
leave them and quickly dispose of the lace bra. Mimi knew she was 
going to start drooling or panting if Sora didn&#39;t hurry up soon. But 
her desires were answered as Sora slid the shorts down and kicked them 
aside.

&quot;Is this better, Mimi?&quot; Mimi didn&#39;t answer and only admired the almost 
bare body standing in front of her, the thin waist and narrow hips, 
the small, round, breasts and the erect nipples standing out against 
the lighter flesh.

Mimi grabbed Sora around the waist, pulling her in closer so she could 
do something, anything Sora wanted. She explored every curve she could 
see, running her fingers across the arched back until Sora moaned her 
name and sighed heavily in anticipation, eager for Mimi to continue. 

Mimi&#39;s lips barely grazed the area just below the breasts, and when 
she began covering the area with her sweet kisses she traveled lower 
to the navel.

&quot;These have to go,&quot; Mimi said, referring to the light, blue panties 
that hugged Sora&#39;s narrow hips. She reached for them, pulled them down 
and Sora kicked them aside along with her shorts. 

&quot;I know what you&#39;d like me to do,&quot; Mimi said, exploring the round 
curve of the breasts. She didn&#39;t want her hands to stop touching 
Sora&#39;s skin. She wanted to make her moan, and scream her name out.

&quot;And what&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;This,&quot; Mimi replied, grinning wildly as her hands traveled lower, 
between Sora&#39;s legs and pressed against one specific spot. 

&quot;Oh, Mimi. Again.&quot; Sora said softly, knowing very well that she liked 
what Mimi just did and wanted her to do it again.

&quot;I can do more than just that.&quot; Mimi knew what she would like and 
figured that maybe if she did it Sora, Sora would enjoy it as well. 

&quot;I can also do this.&quot; She playfully squeezed the right nipple between 
her thumb and forefinger before taking it in her mouth and swirling 
her tongue around it.

&quot;Do you like that?&quot; Sora bit down on her lip and nodded her head in 
approval. 

&quot;Mimi, the other one&#133;.&quot; Mimi obeyed her love&#39;s pleas and gave the 
other nipple the same treatment, her tongue swirling around it 
furiously. 

Sora was so lost in the moment she didn&#39;t realize how drowsy she was 
feeling from Mimi toying with her. Her legs were giving way beneath 
her and Mimi pulled her onto her lap, as she continued fondling the 
sensitive spot between Sora&#39;s legs. 

&quot;Mimi&#133;.&quot;

&quot;Like this&#133;.&quot; She said, kissing the right shoulder as Sora guided 
Mimi&#39;s hand, working fervently at helping her reach her highest peak.

Sora bent down to kiss Mimi&#39;s lips, maddened by the sharp tingling 
sensation coming from below. And she rocked her hips in synch with 
Mimi&#39;s hand as Mimi sucked hard on the erect nipples and kissed them.

Removing her hand and lips from Sora, Mimi laid her on the bed, flat 
on her back, eager to finish what she started. She wasted no time in 
spreading the legs further apart.

&quot;I want to see everything,&quot; she whispered, looking up a bit to see 
Sora&#39;s face, delighting to see her flush.

Again planting delicate butterfly kisses along the flat abdomen, she 
traveled lower, teasing Sora since she still hadn&#39;t finished what she 
started. Soon she reached her destination, took in the sight of the 
glittering trickle on the inner thigh, and savored the sweet, womanly 
scent before planting more kisses, this time along the inner thigh, 
her tongue dancing across the area.

&quot;Mimi, please,&quot; Sora moaned, frustrated that Mimi would purposely skip 
the spot she needed it most and instead tease her.

&quot;I will, just wait.&quot;

Sora tossed and turned as Mimi finally dove in, and explored the 
delicate petals with the tip of her tongue.

&quot;Oh, Sora. I can taste you&#133;.&quot;

Sora could only stay there and beg Mimi to do more.

&quot;Oh, God. Please&#133;.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not God, Sora. You know my name. What is it?&quot; Mimi asked between 
licks.

&quot;Mimi, please!&quot; Sora screamed, taking matters into her own hands as 
she began stroking the sensitive spot Mimi still ignored. But Mimi 
removed Sora&#39;s hand, disappointed.

&quot;Let me.&quot;

And Sora got exactly what she wanted though she was too drunk on the 
sensations to realize what was happening anymore, becoming more lost 
in the moment as Mimi used her fingers and lips to help Sora reach her 
peak.

A moment later she cried Mimi&#39;s name out loud as she reached it, 
letting the sensations wash over her and course through every inch of 
her being before dropping her head on the pillow and going limp.

&quot;Did you like that?&quot; Mimi asked as she moved next to Sora. Her reply 
was the panting and the look of awe on Sora&#39;s face. Mimi brought her 
hand up to her mouth and sucked the fingers to taste the sweet juices.

&quot;Oh, Mimi. That was incredible.&quot; Mimi smiled in approval and kissed 
Sora on the mouth.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you liked it.&quot;

&quot;Of course I did, but now it&#39;s my turn to do the same to you.&quot; With 
that Sora rolled over and straddled Mimi&#39;s hips, eager to undress her 
and explore every inch, every pleasurable spot. She helped her lover 
pull the shirt off and she practically tore the bra off. She leaned in 
for a kiss of Mimi&#39;s lips as she squeezed the firm breasts, using her 
thumbs to fondle the nipples until Mimi sucked in her breath, moaning 
for more.

She quickly worked, lower and disposed of the shorts along with the 
panties. Her goal was to do the same to Mimi as Mimi had done for her. 
She was going to make Mimi pant and moan her name before finally 
taking Mimi with her lips and tongue, until her lover couldn&#39;t take it 
any longer and let her have her way&#133;.

~*~

 

 

 

 

Sora awoke with a start. The first sight she beheld was that of Mimi, 
her lover, her partner and the memories of the prior night came 
rushing back into her mind. Se smiled. Mimi was facing her and she 
could see the beautiful face, especially the carnation lips that she 
longed to kiss. 

It was about 10:00, or so. She knew she had to wake Mimi up so they 
could finish the painting. There would be no time to do it tomorrow 
since they both had to go to work and school. She reached out and ran 
her fingers through the soft hair. Almost instantly Mimi&#39;s chocolate, 
brown eyes fluttered open and a smile appeared on her lips.

&quot;Good morning, sleepy head. How&#39;d you sleep?&quot;

&quot;Well enough, but I missed you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m here now. We have to get up,&quot; she replied as she continued 
stroking Mimi&#39;s hair.

&quot;I had a great time last night.&quot;

&quot;I did to.&quot; Mimi closed her eyes as she felt Sora&#39;s lips covering the 
area of her shoulder.

&quot;I love you. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without you.&quot;

&quot;What would we do without each other?&quot; Sora asked.

&quot;Let&#39;s not think like that. What matters is that we&#39;re together now.&quot;

&quot;Always?&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot;
