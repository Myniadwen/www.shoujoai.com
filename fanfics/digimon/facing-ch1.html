<h1>Facing the Truth</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rascal45.html">rascal45 Death's Seraphim</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The sun shone over the campus of Odaiba University. The golden fingers 
of its rays crept into each and every window of the dorms of the 
campus of the campus. The sunshine entered one room in particular 
where a figure arose from her bed. Raising from her bed, she looked 
through the window.

Seventeen year old, Mimi Tachikawa viewed the birds singing in the 
trees near her window. She had a good reason to be happy today. The 
end of the week was her eighteenth birthday and her college friends 
were planning a birthday party that they say she&#39;ll never forget for 
as long as she lives.

&quot;That&#39;s what they said.&quot; she told herself with excitement. &quot;But, I 
won&#39;t believe it until I see it for myself.&quot; She grabbed her personal 
bath materials as she opened the bathroom door of her suite dorm room. 
She entered the room and removed her pajamas from the night before and 
entered the shower stall. After turning on the water to the desired 
temperature, she allowed the warm water to caress her skin and allow 
it to soothe her.

~*~

&quot;Hey Mimi!&quot; the trio of girls shouted out to her as the teenager 
walked up toward her friends. &quot;Hey, you girls. How are you girls 
doing?&quot; she asked them.

The first girl, Aisha, was short and had black, straight hair. &quot;So are 
you excited about your birthday party this Saturday night?&quot; she asked 
Mimi.

&quot;Yes I am.&quot; Mimi answered &quot;And Sakura and Misashi,&quot; she addressed the 
other girls. &quot;You girls better be telling the truth about this party 
that you&#39;re throwing for me.&quot;

Sakura&#39;s face brightened as she brushed a strand of her brown face 
from her face. &quot;You know it, girlfriend. We&#39;ll have gifts, snacks, 
and...&quot; Sakura then playfully jabbed Mimi in the side. 
&quot;...Entertainment.&quot;

Mimi&#39;s face was a bright shade of red as the trio of girls had huge 
grins on each of their faces. &quot;Plus, no annoying boys allowed for our 
party.&quot; Misashi added. &quot;We are going to have a total blast.&quot;

&quot;Anyway,&quot; Mimi started to speak again. &quot;I have to get to class.&quot; She 
picked up her pace of movement. &quot;See you girls later.&quot; she said as she 
waved to her friends.

&quot;See you later Mimi.&quot; the three girls replied to her.

~*~

Mimi sat down in her chair of her class in psychology course. She 
looked around her and smiled when she saw a familiar face. Her best 
friend for so long sat down next to her.

&quot;Sora, how are you doing?&quot; Mimi asked.

Sora smiled at her friend. &quot;I&#39;m alright, Mimi.&quot;

&quot;You looked really nice today.&quot; Mimi continued as she complimented her 
friend&#39;s style of clothing.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Sora replied. &quot;You help me with my choice of wardrobe, 
remember?&quot; she added.

Mimi smiled. &quot;I wasn&#39;t so sure you would want to try a new look.&quot;

&quot;Well, I guess I decided I should try.&quot; Sora responded.

Mimi looked behind her. &quot;Uh-oh. The professor is coming now. We should 
get ready for class.

Mimi looked at the teacher as he began his lecture for the day. 
However, Sora&#39;s attention on the other hand was not toward the 
professor. It was on someone else in her vision.

&quot;She is sure beautiful.&quot; Sora told herself. &quot;A vision of unspoilt 
loveliness that I can never have for my own.&quot; She sighed. &quot;I knew I 
should just forget about it. Even though we&#39;re good friends, we are 
still from two different worlds and I can never find a definite home 
within her world. I know I should just give up but no matter how hard 
I try, I can&#39;t. I just can&#39;t.&quot;

~*~

&quot;Hey Mimi.&quot;

Mimi looked behind her and saw Sakura walking up to her. She stopped 
and waited for her friend to catch up to her. &quot;Yeah Sakura.&quot; she 
replied to her friend. &quot;What is it?&quot; she asked Sakura.

Sakura looked at Mimi for while obviously cotemplating about what she 
was going to tell Mimi. She took a breath and began. &quot;Mimi, I know you 
want all of your friends to your party. Right?&quot;

&quot;Yes, that&#39;s true.&quot;

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know if all of your friends would want to go to show up 
at the party.&quot; Sakura said. &quot;Your friend..Sora. You invited her. 
Right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I did.&quot; Mimi replied. &quot;What&#39;s the problem?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll enjoy herself, because...&quot; Sakura whispered 
something in Mimi&#39;s ear. Mimi&#39;s eyes widen after hearing what Sakura 
had to tell her. &quot;Are you sure about that?&quot; she asked Sakura and she 
recieved a reply of. &quot;That is just what I heard and to tell you the 
truth I&#39;m kinda of uncomfortable being girls or other people like 
that.&quot; Sakura walked away from Mimi leaving her to think about what 
Sakura had said.

&quot;Damn, that is not how Sora is?&quot; Mimi told herself. &quot;She isn&#39;t that 
kind of person is she?&quot; she told herself. &quot;Could she?&quot;

~*~

That Saturday night, the party began at Mimi&#39;s and her family&#39;s summer 
beach house. The building was filled with the mass of girls for Mimi&#39;s 
party. Their were plenty of music and an all around good time.

&quot;Okay Mimi. Its time you recieved your final and SPECIAL present.&quot;

Mimi looked at her friends. She knew what they were talking about but 
she couldn&#39;t wait any longer. &quot;Come on and bring it out.&quot; Aisha and 
another girl pushed out a big box and placed in front of Mimi and sure 
enough out from the box emerged six-foot three of well-chisteled body 
of a male stripper.

The collection of whoops, catcalls, and other sounds of pure lustful 
excitement emerged from the collection of girls. Sakura was 
hyperventalating from what she saw as fished through her purse for 
whatever singles that she can find for this definite moment.

While all of the commotion was going on, Mimi looked around for Sora. 
She knew that she personally invited Sora over for the party despite 
what Sakura told her about Sora&#39;s.....lifestyle and preference. 
However, Sora was her friend and she was no where to be seen. She 
looked over to the balcony and noticed Sora standing there. Obviously, 
Sora wanted to separate herself from the others at the party. She just 
wanted to keep to herself which to Mimi was rather strange.

Mimi got up from her chair. &quot;Excuse me, girls.&quot; She excused herself as 
she walked over to the balcony and Sora. &quot;Hey are you alright Sora?&quot; 
she asked her friend.

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine.&quot; She responded. &quot;I was just thinking.&quot;

&quot;About what?&quot;

&quot;Stuff.&quot; Sora replied as she looked at Mimi. &quot;Hey Mimi, remember that 
conversation we had four years ago?&quot;

Mimi nodded. She was fourteen and Sora was fifteen. &quot;I remember that 
we were talking and you asked me what you should do if you want to 
confess liking someone.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I remember that I said that I would like to show love for 
someone, but I couldn&#39;t since I was afraid that I might ruin the 
friendship with that person.&quot;

Mimi nodded. &quot;I told you that sometimes that you have to take risks in 
life. You should just tell that person. I mean you have everything to 
gain and nothing to lose.&quot;

Sora looked at Mimi. A look of concern was on her face. &quot;I should just 
say what I&#39;m feeling to that person?&quot; she asked.

Mimi smiled and placed her hand on Sora&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Trust me.&quot; she 
said. &quot;It&#39;s a good idea and I&#39;m sure that person would love to find 
out about how you feel about that person.&quot;

&quot;Alright.&quot; Sora began before taking Mimi&#39;s hand. Mimi was a bit 
confused about why Sora was holding her hand like that. Looking at 
Mimi, Sora raised Mimi&#39;s hand up to her lips and she kissed it.

~*~

Mimi was stunned by Sora&#39;s action. A feeling of weakness came in her 
stomach and knees. &quot;Sora...&quot; she whispered. Sora let go of Mimi&#39;s 
hand. &quot;I...I gotta go.&quot; Mimi whispered as she walked back into the 
party. &quot;Um...girls...I like it if you...guys left for tonight.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Aisha was amazed at Mimi&#39;s proposal. &quot;Why Mimi?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m feeling kind of sick.&quot; Mimi told her friends. &quot;I would like to 
rest now, if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;

&quot;Well alright, Mimi.&quot; Aisha replied. &quot;Come on girls.&quot;

&quot;See you later, Mimi.&quot; all of the girls left Mimi&#39;s for her to go and 
rest or so she claimed.

~*~

Mimi rested her head on her bed. Her eyes were transfixed on the roof 
of her bedroom. Her eyes looked at the beams before traveling to the 
door. &quot;I knew that you&#39;ll still be there.&quot; Mimi said.

Sora walked up to Mimi&#39;s bed and sat down on the edge. &quot;I still 
wouldn&#39;t mind talking to you.&quot; she held Mimi&#39;s hand. &quot;I hope that you 
don&#39;t mind.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t mind.&quot; Mimi replied. &quot;Besides, Sakura already told me rumors 
about your prefrences. I didn&#39;t believe her at first...&quot;

&quot;Well, its true.&quot;

&quot;Yes, it is.&quot; Mimi replied to Sora&#39;s response. &quot;However, after some 
considerations, I&#39;m actually kind of flattered that I am the one that 
you feel a sense of attraction.&quot; She held Sora&#39;s hand and looked at 
her.

Sora didn&#39;t say anything but drew her head closer to Mimi. &quot;Mimi?&quot; she 
began. &quot;Can I....you probalby don&#39;t want to do it.&quot;

&quot;Do what?&quot; Mimi asked.

&quot;Can I kiss you?&quot; Sora asked after a moment of silence.

Mimi blinked a couple of times. But placing a smile, she placed her 
kisses on Sora&#39;s lips.

*WARNING: LEMON SCENE STARTS NOW!!!*

Sora tasted Mimi&#39;s lips for the first time and she didn&#39;t want to give 
it up. Moving closer to Mimi, she pushed Mimi back on the bed. She 
continue to kiss Mimi&#39;s lips and moved to the side of her face and 
neck. Her butterfly kisses sent tremors down Mimi&#39;s spine. Mimi gasped 
in passion as she felt her friend and possibly new lover lips at work. 
Sora&#39;s tongue and lips worked down to Mimi&#39;s breasts. Sora&#39;s tongue 
ran over each and every area of Mimi&#39;s breasts causing Mimi to gasp 
with greater frequency. Mimi, decided to not to have Sora do all of 
the work, tentaviely placed a hand on her chest and she heard a sigh 
of pleasure escape from Sora&#39;s lips signaling she was doing something 
right. She unfastened Sora&#39;s shirt and removed the covering to expose 
her white, lacy bra and caress Sora&#39;s breasts. Sora held Mimi&#39;s hands 
and placed up to her lips briefly. She removed Mimi&#39;s top and quickly 
removed Mimi&#39;s bra and her own.

Entangling each other hands, Sora sucked on one of Mimi&#39;s tits and 
later did the same with the other. Mimi gasped as she felt Sora&#39;s 
tongue doing its work. She never felt such a sense of passion that was 
coming out of her body. She pulled Sora closer to her body as she 
whispered. &quot;Please, give me more...&quot; Sora heard Mimi&#39;s request and 
began to pull off Mimi&#39;s shorts and panties. Mimi rose up and pulled 
Sora&#39;s dress pants from her delicate body. They spent every loving 
moment caressing their body searching for each other points of 
exihalarition and extreme pleasure that only the other knew about.

Mimi and Sora&#39;s lips enlocked in another kiss of passion before Sora 
whispered. &quot;Mimi, I knew that I want and need you. Let me show you how 
much I mean that.&quot;

Mimi nodded as Sora laid Mimi down on the bed. Placing her head in 
front of Mimi&#39;s hips. She placed her face and fingers inside of Mimi&#39;s 
thighs. Her lips planted delicate kisses up between her thighs. &quot;Oh 
Kami!&quot; Mimi cried out in passion. Smiling, Sora continue to kiss Mimi 
in that sensitive area until she keep to Mimi&#39;s treasure. Her 
womanhood shielded by the short hair of her mound. Sora took a moment 
to inhale Mimi&#39;s scent. She placed her kisses on her lower lips of her 
lover.

Mimi cried out in passion as she felt Sora&#39;s mouth over her womanhood. 
Her body and hips instinicivly moved to receive more of Sora&#39;s lips.

Sora worked her magic of satisfying Mimi&#39;s wanting and passions and 
her own. She felt the fluids dripping from Mimi on her tongue. She 
hungrily drank it up as she placed her fingers inside of Mimi looking 
to receive more of that forbidden drink from her new lover and best 
friend. Mimi&#39;s cheek was reddened with extreme emotion and she didn&#39;t 
want to let go. She placed Sora&#39;s head closer to her giving her more 
access. She felt her body was starting to stiffen as she knew that she 
knew that soon she give her everything. Her eyes widen. &quot;SORA!!&quot; she 
cried out as her body stiffen as the final waves of passions went 
through her body.

Sora aroused from Mimi&#39;s womanhood as she licked a fewof the loose 
fluids from her fingers as she gave her fingers to Mimi for her to 
suck. After tasting her juices, she looked at Sora. &quot;Allow me to love 
you Sora?&quot; she asked. Sora smiled and kissed Mimi&#39;s on the forehead. 
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about me. I just wanted you to recieved passions like 
this.&quot; She kissed Mimi again.

Mimi blushed slightly and looked at Sora. &quot;Arigato.&quot; she whispered.

~*~

The next week at school, Mimi walked down the halls of school and saw 
Sora standing there. &quot;Sora, wait up.&quot;

Sora turned around and smiled seeing Mimi. She walked over to Mimi and 
embraced. &quot;How are you Mimi?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m alright.&quot; Mimi replied. &quot;By the way Sora, after classes do you 
want to go out and get something to drink?&quot;

&quot;Like as a date?&quot;

&quot;Yeah like a date.&quot;

&quot;Then sure.&quot; Sora embraced Mimi as she smelled Mimi&#39;s scent.

&quot;Mimi!&quot;

Mimi looked at who called out to her. It was Sakura and Aisha. &quot;Yes, 
what is it?&quot;

&quot;Um....Mimi.....aren&#39;t you telling us something?&quot; Sakura began.

&quot;Yeah, don&#39;t you know what kind of person....Sora is?&quot; Aisha added.

Mimi scowled. &quot;Yes, I do know and I have one thing to say.&quot; She then 
surprised the other two girls by kissing Sora right there at the very 
spot. After releasing her kiss, she looked at Sakura and Aisha 
straight in the eye and said. &quot;Now if you excuse me.&quot; She walked off 
with her arm around Sora.

&quot;Hey Mimi.&quot; Sora said. &quot;I have one thing to tell you. Thanks for being 
my friend and accepting my love for you.&quot;</pre>
