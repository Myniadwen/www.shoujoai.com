<h1>The Kitsune and the Huntress (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a>

<a href="../digimon/kithunt-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Almost as soon as Renamon entered the forest, she
leapt up into the high branches to keep away from the
many dangerous beasts that dwelt on the ground below.
She jumped quickly from tree branch to branch, her
motion barely disturbing the snow covered leaves until
she finally reached a secluded part of the forest.

She leapt down to the ground nearby a large hill and
then Renamon smoothly pulled open a well concealed
entrance. Once she was certain they were unobseved she
carefully carried Rika down the long descending
passageway into her underground den, firmly closing
the enterance behind them. It was warm in the cavern,
the air sweet but she was only concerned with the
fragile form she carried.

Renamon gently undressed Rika first, setting aside
battered, dirty garments then carefully laid her down
on a soft bed of tanned furs. She looked with fear and
concern how bone thin Rika was, thinking to herself,
&#145;First some rest, then I need to feed her.&#146; Renamon
sniffed slightly and smiled, &quot;Not to mention a bath.&quot;
Renamon smoothly knelt down there, then she lay down
beside her even as Rika curled instinctively into her
comforting warmth.

Renamon looked over at the sleeping girl beside her
thoughtfully, and let herself remember. Hiding in the
shadows Renamon had gone to watch the village when her
loneliness became too much to bear, needing to be in
the presence of others, even ones so different than
she was. She had often seen Rika from the safety and
shelter of the forest, when Rika was living in her
small village. The girl had seemed angry, and
strangely alone, even when she was with her Mother and
Grandmother. Renamon had found herself coming back to
watch her again and again over the fall, and felt
something, some kind of bond developing with the young
girl.

Rika was a huntress and a fighter, but she lived in a
village that was made up of only crafters and healers.
The others seemed to watch her with a great deal of
astonishment, confusion and often anger. Renamon
watched the furor when Rika flatly refused a betrothal
to the young man, Rio and could almost sense the
girl&#146;s pain and confusion. Feeling Rika move against
her slightly brought Renamon back to the present and
the girl laying beside her.

When she had looked into Rika&#146;s dark eyes, Renamon had
seen such great pain and a deep loneliness. It had
reminded her of her own situation, being so far from
home and her blood kin. &#145;Maybe together,&#146; she thought,
looking down at the red haired girl, gently ruffling
the red hair, &#145;we can help ease each other&#146;s
loneliness.&#146;

&#147;I would be here for you, Rika,&#148; Renamon whispered
softly to the still deeply sleeping girl, &#147;if you will
let me.&#148; With those words, she gently pulled the furs
up around them both and tried to get some sleep as
well.

Rika began to stir, the sweet scent of cooking food
bringing her slowly but surely back to conciousness.
She sat up in bed then blushed faintly and moved to
cover her nudity as she realized that her dirty
clothes were missing.

&#147;I cleaned off your garments,&#148; Renamon soft voice came
from the shadows and Rika started, not having heard
her footsteps.

Renamon walked nearly silently into the room, using
that same sort of grace she had in the dark forest,
carrying a steaming wooden cup in her hands. Still,
there was something different about her, a sense of
relaxation in this strange place they were in. She
smoothly knelt down beside where Rika sat up on the
bed and gently placed the cup to her lips, a hand
supporting Rika&#39;s back.

Renamon gently instructed, &#147;Drink it down slowly,
please. You&#146;re still very weak, and I do not wish to
make you sick.&#148;

Rika sipped carefully and found the richly made soup
tasted wonderful, then gently pushed the cup away to
smile and say, &#147;Thank you very much.&#148;

Renamon didn&#146;t say anything, she just smiled back at
her and Rika marveled at how easily she could read the
kitsune&#146;s face. Rika looked around her, marveling at
the size of the chamber that she lay in. The roof was
nearly twice as high as Renamon was tall, and the
walls were hung with many furs or painted with
patterns or scenes of the outside world. Soft
candlelight gave the room a mysterious feel, and
openings lead into other rooms.

&#147;You are very welcome,&#148; Renamon said simply. Rika
shook weakly, and Renamon gently slipped an arm around
her to help hold her up. &#147;You still have a bit of
fever,&#148; Renamon noted, &#147;but your body is already
fighting it off.&#148; She offered Rika a robe, smiling.

With a bit of assistance, Rika slipped it on. &#147;This
place is wonderful!&#148; Rika exclaimed with a smile. She
was so weak that she got tangled up in the sleeping
furs, and laughed as Renamon helped her up. &#147;And it&#146;s
gigantic!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll show you around, then. This is the bedroom,&#148;
Renamon said, gesturing around the room they were
standing in. She took Rika&#146;s hand and led her gently
from the pile of furs. There were four other rooms, of
which Renamon showed Rika three, a large study, rough
kitchen, and large storehouse. The other room was the
only one with a real wooden door, which Renamon pulled
open easily. &#147;And finally, the bath,&#148; Renamon said
with a smile. She led Rika down a carved stone
stairway, until they reached a rock cavern with a
volcanic heated pool.

&#147;Not bad,&#148; Rika said, trying not to show how delighted
she was by it. Renamon led her over to one end of the
pool, softly explaining that it was the cooler end,
away from the volcanic vent that heated the water and
provided warmth for the den itself. Rika hissed a bit,
but soon relaxed in the warmth of the slowly flowing
water.

Renamon smiled as she watched Rika for a few minutes,
then rose with a smile. &#147;Rika, I need to leave you for
a little while,&#148; she said, &#147;but you will be safe here.
The entrance way is protected by traps, and no one has
ever succeeded in breaking in.&#148;

Rika looked up at her a moment then she nodded,
accepting what Renamon said. &#147;Just be back soon,&#148; Rika
said to her softly, as she watched Renamon&#146;s sleek
form walk gracefully up the steps to the bed chamber
above.

Renamon swiftly made her way through the bedroom then
up and out of the hidden exit passage. She bounced
between the trees towards the very edge of the forest,
then swooped down to pounce on something that was
running across the snow covered field. She struck out
once, cleanly, and in a moment the hare was dead.

&#147;You will help another survive,&#148; Renamon told the dead
animal softly.

She gently carried it with her until she reached the
familiar looking little home. In the safety of the
shadows, she saw the grandmother tending to the other
woman, Rika&#146;s mother, who looked much better than she
had before. Renamon set the rabbit down by the door,
tapped on it once, and then was gone before anyone
could react.

As Renamon left she could hear the door open, pausing
a moment to observe from the shadows. &#147;More meat,&#148;
Rika&#146;s Grandmother said, looking out over the snow
covered ground. There were no footprints left, no
visible trace of any presence having ever been there.
&#147;Oh Rika,&#148; she whispered to herself softly, &#145;what on
Earth is going on?&#148;

Satisfied they were all right Renamon swiftly made her
way home, entering the chamber and smiling at the
sight of Rika sitting happily atop the bed furs. &#147;It&#39;s
about time you got here,&#148; a very clean and toasty warm
looking Rika said to Renamon cheerfully, carefully
sipping another mug full of the delicious tasting hot
soup.

Renamon laughed softly, smiling over at Rika. &#147;I see
you found the kitchen then,&#148; Renamon said, looking at
the mug.

Rika was fully dressed, and had a broad smile on her
face. &#147;Thank you for the new boots, by the way,&#148; Rika
said, holding up one of her feet encased in snug,
supple leather.

&#147;I&#146;m glad you like them,&#148; Renamon said as she walked
over to Rika&#39;s side. &#147;They will allow you to move much
more silently through the woods,&#148; Renamon finished.
She had to fight the urge to laugh at the wounded look
that Rika gave her.

&#147;I&#146;m not that bad at it,&#148; a blushing Rika said,
looking down into her half full cup before taking
another drink. She looked towards the study with such
a look of intense longing on her face it brought forth
a soft chuckle from Renamon.

&#147;Why don&#146;t you go in and look around?&#148; Renamon asked
her curiously as she settled down to sit beside the
girl.

Rika held up her mug in explaination. &#147;Mother taught
me scrolls and drinks do not mix,&#148; she said smiling.
&#147;But where did you get so many of them?&#148; Rika asked
Renamon eagerly. Just looking through the door there
were more scrolls than she had seen in her life!

&#147;In the land I come from, reading is very common. Out
here, however...,&#148; Renamon said, and then gave a
helpless shrug.

Renamon showed Rika around the study, the many racks
of scrolls in their cases and how they were sorted.
Rika pulled one down, unrolling it just a bit to read
the first few lines, then reverently put it back.
Looking around curiously, Rika&#146;s eyes lit up where she
saw a popular strategy game sitting there on a table
as well.

&#147;I almost think I&#39;ve died and gone to heaven,&#148; Rika
finally sighed. As she and Renamon pulled down various
scrolls, Rika was again struck by Renamon&#146;s fierce
beauty. Her face was so alive and animated, as she
talked about some of the scrolls with such passionate
intensity that Rika nearly forgot that Renamon wasn&#146;t
human.

In the days following after that soon fell into a
regular pattern. Rika and Renamon woke up together in
the mornings and one of them would get up to cook
their breakfast. Renamon would leave for awhile then
shortly return to Rika&#146;s side.

The rest of the morning and into the midafternoon they
both spent out in the woods, where Renamon taught Rika
the numerous secrets of woods craft as well as
exploring and protecting the wild lands together. She
soon learned of Renamon&#146;s many magical gifts including
her greatest talent: the power of transformation.

With the aid of another&#146;s spirit, Renamon could change
her form into one of two others. The giant fox
Kyubimon was one, and the robed mystic Taomon was
another, each with their own special powers and unique
abilities. Quite strangely, with Rika&#146;s willing aid
she could transform much easier than she had ever been
able to before.

&#147;It&#146;s very strange,&#148; Renamon said to her softly some
weeks after Rika&#39;a arrival, &#147;for among my kind it is
exceedingly rare to find one whom you have such a deep
connection.&#148; She smiled at Rika, &#147;You grant me great
strength, Rika, thank you.&#148;

Rika blushed as she said, &#147;I feel the connection, too,
sometimes.&#148; The blush darkened, and she quickly
changed the subject.

The evenings were spent down in the den, where they
would talk for hours, read and play many different
games of strategy with each other. They would eat, and
Renamon would go out again. Once she came back, they
would soon retire to their fur covered bed.

And each and every day on those trips that she took
alone, Renamon would deliver fresh meat for breakfast
and dinner to Rika&#146;s family, in accordance to the vow
that she had made to Rika. She also kept watch over
them and anyone that dared cause them any trouble soon
learned to deeply regret it. Rika herself did not
speak of, or even ask about, her family, but Renamon
knew that the young woman thought of them often.

Together, they would shadow the few hunters who were
brave or mad enough to dare to come into the woods. As
thay shepherd them from the more unusual dangers
hidden there, from time to time, one of them would
catch a glimpse of Rika or Renamon.

Soon, some tall tales of &#145;Rika&#146;s Ghost&#146; began to
circulate in many of the nearby villages and the small
towns beyond the forest, to both of their amusement.
But Rika realized that the tales would eventually
reach her family and cause them a great deal of pain.
Finally, half a year after they had first met, when
the summer sun finally began to win out over the dark
rainclouds of spring, Rika came to Renamon with a
question.

&#147;Would it be all right,&#148; Rika softly began, &#147;if I
could go home for a day or so? I wonder how my family
is, and I want them to know that I&#146;m well and safe.&#148;

&#147;Of course you can,&#148; Renamon said tentatively, knowing
that this time would someday come &#147;if you wish, we can
go tomorrow morning.&#148; She looked deeply worried,
troubled by the painful knowledge that Rika might not
choose to return to her.

As if she was reading Renamon&#146;s mind, Rika smiled
brightly and firmly said &#147;Of course I&#146;m coming back,
you dope!&#148;

Renamon looked at her in surprise, then laughed
softly. &#147;Do not be so sure Rika,&#148; Renamon cautioned
her. &#147;Family can be difficult to refuse.&#148;

&#147;Maybe,&#148; Rika said intensely, looking up to meet
Renamon&#146;s eyes &#147;but I consider you to be part of my
family as well.&#148;</pre>
