the great hall.

&quot;Father&quot; Tasha gasped as she entered in &quot;calm down, my brother can&#39;t get 
on with his work.&quot;

Tasha was soon to be 16 she was exactly a year older than Ash. Rage 
glared into his daughter, it reminded him of his first wife, his own 
eyes painted on her face.

&quot;It&#39;s his and your birthday 3 months time&quot; Rage spat, &quot;I am creating a 
ball, a magnificent one.&quot;

&quot;When is my brother&#39;s birthday?&quot; Tasha asked excitedly

&quot; The same day as you&quot; Rage said. &quot; The first sunrise of the January&quot; 
Rage started &quot;2135 at Four o&#39;clock, I look upon my new daughter, the 
apple of my eye. The joy turned to teas when I found out that your 
mother Cleanses died giving birth, she found your life more important 
than hers. I had to accept that fact, then I met Delia a school friend 
she was about your age when I first met her, you where two months old, 
when I married Delia, Marth was aware that Zelda was in danger at Hyrule 
so he sent her here too look after you she was assisted by the priests. 
When Delia was pregnant Angelica was cruel, &quot; Rage starts to break down 
&quot;she missed your mother, Cleanses and Aunt Angelica was the best of 
friends since they where 3, she cared for me as well.&quot; Rage stood up 
with a brave face &quot; one day Delia slapped Angelica, I was as drunk.... I 
turned violent.&quot; Rage gasped for breath. &quot; I hitted her, punched her 
beated her up, Angelica cheered me on. When a Delia was eight months 
pregnant she disappeared. &quot; A week later a letter came Delia asked for a 
divorce. I didn&#39;t want to but Angelica bribed me to do it, I signed, 
weeks later,&quot; tears rolling down his face &quot; the divorce was complete, I 
hated Angelica, one day I could have killed her, but she had Tasha in 
her hand but her words where look at your daughter she should be your 
number one priority, children are a gift, you will see your second child 
one day, until then focus on Tasha&#39; Angelica gave me new ways she gave 
me the strength to carry on. My sibling-in-laws have been so kind to me. 
Now I have it all.&quot; Tasha came over and hugged her father.

&quot;Father&quot; Tasha announced &quot;dry your tears we have a ball to organise we 
mustn&#39;t waste a second&quot;

Rages returned to his formal self, pointing at the fairies and the 
servants passing by

&quot;SERVANTS&quot; king Rage roared. &quot; ORGANISE A BALL, THE BEST YOU CAN EVER 
DO, I WANT LOADS OF GUESTS, AND IT SHOULD BE THE BEST NIGHT OF THEIR 
LIVES EVER!&quot;

Meanwhile back at the classroom in the monastary The clouds exploded, it 
poured with rain, Then while they waited outside, a shock came on to 
them someone walked out who was suppose 2 be dead, it was mr Grinal

&quot;EVERY ONE ON THE SLABS GUYS&quot; Grinal roared.

Remember they are not at a school, they are in the monastery, Kari ran 
in her umbrella with Misty the new stowaway.

&quot;THIRTY SECONDS TO LINE UP GUYS&quot; Grinal roared. &quot;10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1, 
INSIDE GUYS&quot;

The class-entered in. half the class fell over.

&quot;WE DO NOT ENTER THE CLASSROOM IN THAT RUDE FASHION.&quot; Grinal roared. 
&quot;All behind our chairs guys, we&#39;re all silent&quot;

&quot;All silent&quot; Davis shouted out.

&quot;Please don&#39;t impersonate my voice Davis&quot; Grinal snarled at him

&quot;Smile&quot; Ken shouted at Mr Grinal &quot;Jesus loves you&quot;

&quot;Change your tone Ken, K year nine...&quot;

&quot; It&#39;s fifth grade for god&#39;s sake,&quot; Ken pointed out.

&quot; Where&#39;s Ant and Dec?&quot; Himeno shouted out, Grinal ignored her,

&quot;Ken, go outside&quot; Grinal snapped &quot;and pray to the lord. On the slabs&quot;

&quot; You must be joking&quot; Ken snapped back &quot; in the pouring rain FOR GOD&#39;S 
SAKE&quot; Ken slammed the door so hard a chip came on the window.

&quot;We do not say the lord&#39;s name in vein guys.&quot; Grinal announced. &quot;30 
seconds to write the title and aim guys.&quot;

&quot; Sir,&quot; Davis said &quot; where&#39;s Ant and Dec?&quot;

&quot;And we thought you where dead is well&quot; Kari shouted out

&quot; I&#39;m quite lucky guys&quot; Grinal smirked to himself Ant and Dec is 
covering Mr O&#39;Grady&#39;s lesson guys so it wont be long before you c them 
again.&quot;

Misty and Kari was chatting like mad, they laughed so loud that Mr 
Grinal couldn&#39;t get on with a normal boring science lesson.

&quot;This is unacceptable behaviour girls,&quot; Grinal whispered

&quot; Am I bovad?&quot; Misty shouted out.

&quot;Misty,&quot; Grinal snapped, &quot; change, your tone&quot;

Misty thought he said change your top

&quot;I BEG YOUR PARDON?&quot; Misty snapped &quot;WHAT THE FUCKING HELL IS WRONG WITH 
MY TOP YOU RETARD!&quot;

&quot;I said change your tone&quot; Grinal snapped.

&quot;No you didn&#39;t you said change your top&quot;

&quot;Do not speak to me in that rude fashion, outside&quot; Grinal ordered. As 
Misty was about to leave the classroom as Ken was allowed back in.

&quot;Mr Grinal&quot; Misty snapped, &quot; you should look up in the dictionary, 
fashion is about clothes&quot;

&quot; Do not speak to me about clothes. &quot; Grinal snapped Misty went outside 
in the pouring rain.

Ant and Dec than came in the class room and made an announcement,

&quot;This time next week,&quot; Dec announced, &quot; a ball will take place to 
celebrate Tasha and Ash&#39;s birthday.&quot;

&quot; The theme is Tudor to Victorian style of rich clothes.&quot; Ant said.&quot; Its 
taking place at the great hall of the castle, first there&#39;ll be a 
banquet in the morning than a ball&quot;

&quot;What a treat.&quot;

&quot; If you&#39;re good guys you&#39;ll be going&quot; Grinal snarled.

&quot;Every one&quot; Ant shouted, &quot; follow Dec and me &quot;

&quot; We&#39;re all going to sing in the rain&quot; Dec sang.

Chaptter27

Meanwhile at the castle Ash and May where reading Harry Potter and the 
goblet of fire, as they finished the quiz books they where looking for 
something for their own chapter of Harry potter, the work set by Ant and 
Dec. When Tasha came over and told them about the ball, a great ball for 
her and her brother&#39;s birthday.

&quot;Oh my god!&quot; May said, &quot; As she was writing down her chapter of Harry 
potter, her chapter was about romance Harry and Hermione get together 
and fall in love. Ash on the other hand wrote a silly chapter where 
Harry, Ron and Hermione use guns, wands, drugs and violence.

Gary was on his last few questions on algebra. A few hours later they 
had finished their work and sent it to the monastary. They could now 
help with the ball arrangements.

Ash demanded that people from the trip would help. Rage had to agree it 
was his day not his. Christmas was coming soon, they where just trying 
to plan a simple day as it&#39;s Rage&#39;s kid&#39;s birthdays on new years day.

Paz the brutal killer stood at the great hall pleased with what he saw, 
Rage took out his mobile as it was ringing he answered it

&quot;Hello&quot;

&quot;Your majesty&quot; the phone whistled, &quot; my reputation as the fighting king 
is brilliant,&quot;

&quot;How many died Jado?&quot; Rage hissed

&quot; I must have killed half of the planet,&quot; Jado laughed

&quot; Well, carry on, Shelito Paz will get the complete blame.&quot; Rage sneered 
as he hung up.

&quot;Now&quot; Rage whispered to himself happily putting on a show, &quot;my 
children&#39;s ball&quot;

Angelica came in with Brock asleep in her arms. She dragged him under 
the castle where Aruikenimon was waiting for her. The two women dragged 
Brock into the huge tower that Rage and this Jado geezer was talking 
about. Aruikenimon intended to destroy him; Angelica had something up 
her sleeve. Angelica grabbed a knife from her dress and aimed at Sister 
Arui, she screamed Aruikenimon was destroyed she turned into black 
pieces of dust. Angelica&#39;s Dagger was pure silver.

&quot;You where obviously not human.&quot; Angelica hissed. She turned around Paz 
the cold-blooded killer arrived.

&quot;Your dagger is clean&quot; Paz snarled &quot;unlike mine&quot; Paz exposed his other 
daggers. &quot; I am the murderer and the traitor.&quot;

&quot; Come killer.&quot; Angelica announced. Paz came to her in haste Angelica 
and Paz squeezed together, Angelica had her dagger at the ready as she 
dug it painfully in his back. Shelito was screaming in his last few 
seconds of living, Angelica then stabbed his head trying to kill him 
brain dead. Angelica tried to pull her dagger out of his head it was 
attached to his brain. She pulled it out as she spotted Jado.

&quot;Well done&quot; Jado hissed. Angelica stood up and smiled.

&quot;No one kills a king or a member from my family&quot; Angelica hissed &quot; and 
gets away with it&quot;

Ash and May entered their room. Ash and May fell into a kiss, arms on 
each other&#39;s back. Then there was a noise, the kiss stopped but their 
bodies did not.

&quot;May,&quot; Ash, said, &quot;did you hear that?&quot;

&quot;Sounds like someone&#39;s crying&quot; May whispered

The noise stopped. There were then footsteps and then out the window a 
shadow of the crier escaped.
