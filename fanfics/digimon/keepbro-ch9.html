<a href="../digimon/keepbro-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>&quot;Oh fuck you drive me crazy Gaz&quot; Jun moaned 

&quot;Shit Do I &quot; Gary whispered. 

They where both in an empty classroom dangerously in love Then Jun 
started ripping her clothes off. Gary pulled apart from her instantly. 

&quot;What the fucking hells in God&#39;s name are you doing?&quot; Gary gasped in 
shock 

&quot;We&#39;re having sex&quot; Jun replied 

&quot;You want me to fuck you&quot; Gary snapped &quot;in a bloody classroom 

&quot;Babe&quot; Jun smiled &quot; I just wanna get fucked.&quot; 

&quot;Not now&quot; 

Why not?&quot; 

&quot; Posh boys like me don&#39;t shag people just anywhere that&#39;s the sort of 
thing chavs do for fuck sake,&quot; Gary complained. Jun was about to pull 
Gary&#39;s face on hers &quot; and holy bugger, it&#39;s against the law&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t give a cock about the law&quot; Jun smirked 

&quot; There&#39;s a time and a place Jun&quot; 

&quot;Like the ocean&quot; Jun hissed as she kissed Gary on the cheek. 

&quot;Exactly like the ocean&quot; Gary replied. Then Jun attempted ripping his 
shirt of. &quot; Fucking hell, I just need to get away&quot; He complained &quot;a 
month, three weeks, a fortnight, I don&#39;t give a shit if it&#39;s just one 
day&quot; 

&quot;Soon I promise!&quot; Jun smiled &quot;we can get our own boat and go wherever we 
please&quot; 

Then that was then Gary started to enjoy Jun&#39;s company. Lips close to 
another, Ibiza&quot; 

&quot;Roma&quot; 

&quot;Paris&quot;&nbsp;

&quot;Jamaica&quot;&nbsp;

&quot;All around the world&quot; 

&quot;Fish and chips or a romantic salad for two?&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind a bit of both&quot; 

They both laughed, enjoying their activity. 

&quot;Then the U.S.A &quot; Jun whispered 

&quot;Wait Jun&quot; Gary replied creating a distance &quot; we gotta get real here for 
one bloody minute, what if every one finds out I cheated on Tasha&quot; 

&quot;Why did you have bring her into it?&quot; Jun smiled. 

&quot;For fucks sake Jun, I&#39;m the Queen&#39;s husband,&quot; Gary complained &quot; I could 
walk down the bloody street and 6000 bloody eyes are on me&quot; bloody 

&quot; We&#39;ll find our own private spot where we can live forever&quot; Jun replied 
massaging his body. 

&quot;Where will that place be?&quot; Gary asked lying down on a table &quot; better 
not be shitty&quot; 

&quot;Just leave it all to me&quot; Jun replied 

&quot; Ah shit I betta go&quot; Gary replied, &quot;get back to everyone else&quot; Gary 
left the classroom, he was hoping that no one was following 
unfortunately Jun was following his every move 

&quot;I&#39;ll call you baby&quot; Jun replied 

I hope you know what you&#39;re bloody well doing Jun because I don&#39;t have a 
fucking clue. 

Gary entered the playground then he spotted TK, he joined in too. He 
seemed happy at last. Ken and Yolei where kissing as they both left the 
playground.
