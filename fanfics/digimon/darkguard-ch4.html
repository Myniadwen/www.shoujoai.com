<h1>Dark Guardian: A Tale of Rika and Renamon (part 4 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a>

<a href="../digimon/darkguard-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>        Rika hadn&#39;t been able to sleep easy for many years now. It was 
something that she had been forced to accept after her parent&#39;s 
deaths, after she had taken up the responsibility for taking care of 
her people. Thoughts of her many tasks, of the dire consequences of 
her possible failure, they restlessly ran through her mind night after 
night.

        But strangely, for the past few nights she had slept soundly.

        Rika had felt herself stirring in the middle of the night, 
sensing something was out of place. She felt warm, and safe, a feeling 
that she hadn&#39;t experienced since she was a small child. Strong arms 
encircled her, and she instinctively snuggled deeper into soft fur.

        &#39;Fur?&#39; Rika thought muzzily.

        Carefully opening her eyes a crack, Rika saw orange-gold fur 
up against her cheek. Her gaze moved up slowly, recognizing the 
woman&#39;s fox- like face above her. Renamon&#39;s face was peaceful, almost 
content, and she seemed to be soundly asleep.

        &#39;She&#39;s holding me...&#39; Rika felt warm, somehow. It felt so 
good, having those strong arms gently wrapped around her body. She 
relaxed, feeling all her concerns drop away, and slipped right back 
into a sound sleep.

        Rika looked up at Renamon as they walked to the court. The 
tall, dignified figure strode beside her. moving with smooth grace. 
&#39;Did I imagine it?&#39; Rika wondered. She had wanted to ask her this 
morning, but somehow she couldn&#39;t seem to manage it.

        Rio waited by the great doors, looked at Renamon nervously. It 
gave Rika a bit of perverse pleasure at how fearful Rio was of the 
kitsune. She had not chosen the man, instead he had inherited the 
title of vizier from his father, and until recently he had done his 
job well.

        &quot;My lady,&quot; Rio bowed to her respectfully. He couldn&#39;t risk 
doing anything else, with Renamon&#39;s cool presence by her side.

        Rika had to fight back a smile at his deeply pained 
expression. &quot;So what are the petitions for today?&quot; she asked him.

        Rio unfurled the scroll and read, &quot;Several minor nobles have 
put petitions before you. There&#39;s apparently a land despute going on, 
as well as a betrothal that needs your approval.&quot;

        &quot;A betrothal?&quot; Rika raised her eyebrow curiously.

        &quot;Two ladies of noble blood,&quot; Rio&#39;s upper lip curled in 
disgust, &quot;who wish your permision to break with tradition and marry 
each other.&quot; He shook his head as he added, &quot;You&#39;ll just dismiss the 
request, of course.&quot;

        &quot;And why would Rika wish to do that?&quot; Renamon coldly asked 
him, not at all liking his presumption. &#39;It&#39;s Rika&#39;s decision to make, 
not this little toad,&#39; she thought.

        Rio glared at Renamon, for a moment forgetting his fear of 
her, &quot;It has never been done in this realm! I know that the land of 
Ohtori alows such things, but...&quot;

        Rika smiled slightly as she calmed them both, &quot;I will hear 
their petition, first. Then I will make my decision on the matter.&quot;

        &quot;Of course, m&#39;lady,&quot; Rio bowed.

        A guard swiftly pushed open the great doors to the hall, and 
Renamon putting a hand gently on Rika&#39;s shoulder to stop her from 
stepping forward. &quot;Must we walk through the crowd?&quot; Renamon asked her 
Lady softly.

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Rika murmured back. She smiled up at Renamon sweetly, 
&quot;But I&#39;m quite confident that you can protect me.&quot;

        Renamon&#39;s own lips quirked slightly, &quot;I&#39;m so glad.&quot;

        Rika strode forward, Renamon shadowing her closely as they 
walked down the central aisle to the chair Rika usually officiated 
from. Renamon scanned the room restlessly as they walked, her body 
coiled and ready to move against anyone who would threaten Rika.

        Renamon carefully checked the podium, then let Rika sit down 
on the chair. Renamon had asked Rika why she used such a plain thing, 
not an real throne, and Rika had smiled at her wryly saying, &quot;It helps 
keep me humble.&quot;

        As had become the custom Renamon loudly declared, &quot;All those 
who would threaten Lady Rika, you will not live to regret it.&quot;

        The crowd knew that she meant every word, too. &#39;Rumours of 
what happened at the noodle stand must have already spread,&#39; Rika 
noted. They had been eating, Rika along with Renamon in her human 
form, when Renamon saw something just behind Rika. She tore the 
chopstick she was holding with her teeth, then tossing the sharpened 
wood over Rika&#39;s shoulder, and the knife weilding assasin had fallen 
dead to the ground.

        Renamon had lead her away, her arm protectively across Rika&#39;s 
shoulders. She felt shaken, somehow, even though she knew that the 
assasins were still chasing her. It had been so peaceful the last few 
days, her guard had gone down a little bit. &#39;But Renamon,&#39; she thought 
as she looked up at her protector admiringly, &#39;was still ready for 
anything.&#39;

        Rika dealt with the land dispute simply, quizing both parties 
on the ownership of the valley that they both claimed. Not recieving 
an useful answer, she instead claimed the disputed strip of land 
between their properties for the crown. Both men were forbidden to 
trespass there, and Rika hoped that it would give them time to cool 
off a bit.

        &quot;Nicely done,&quot; Renamon murmured with a smile.

        Rika felt surprisingly pleased on hearing that, whispering 
back to her &quot;Thank you.&quot;

        Rio tapped his staff on the floor loudly, getting a fierce 
look from Renamon. Quite nervously he squeaked, &quot;Next!&quot;

        The two women made their way up to the front, recieving a few 
glares as they moved on. The taller, long haired one shielded her 
companion, returning the gazes calmly. Her shorter friend looked a bit 
more delicate on the surface, but when Rika met her eyes by chance, 
she saw strength there.

        &quot;My name is Kari,&quot; the young woman with short, brown hair 
declaired calmly.

        &quot;And I am Yolei,&quot; the taller woman bowed slightly.

        &quot;Yolie, Kari,&quot; Rika said to them calmly, &quot;what is your 
petition?&quot;

        Surprisingly it was Kari who stepped forward, &quot;We have come 
seeking your permision so that we may be married.&quot;

        Rika looked over at Yolie who smiled, &quot;Somethig that I have 
long looked forward to.&quot;

        Poor Rio looked like he was going to pop a blood vessel, Rika 
noted with a smile. Gently she said, &quot;This is quite different than our 
ancient traditions, ladies. Why should I grant this request?&quot;

        &quot;I have loved her since I was a child,&quot; Yolie looked into 
Kari&#39;s eyes, &quot;she holds my heart in her hands. I would never be parted 
from her.&quot;

        Kari nodded gravely, &quot;She is my soulmate, m&#39;lady. I would be 
less than I am, if I were to be parted from her.&quot;

        Rika looked into both youg women&#39;s eyes, reading the sincerity 
in them. She knew that if she granted this request, there would be 
consequences. The priests would be angry, not to mention the more 
conservative nobles. She felt Renamon&#39;s hand on her shoulder, a 
comforting, steadying pressure, and she knew what she had to do.

        &quot;Kari, Yolie, I grant you my leave to be betrothed to each 
other,&quot; Rika said softly. The crowd erupted, only to be quelled by a 
glare from Renamon. Rika looked out at the noble born who filled the 
chamber, &quot;They&#39;re intent is sincere, and by our laws there is NO 
reason to deny them!&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Kari spoke up happily, and Yolie nodded as well, 
her eyes briming with tears.

        &quot;I may not have done you any favors,&quot; Rika said to them softly 
as she looked out at the discontented crowd.

        &quot;We can bear it,&quot; Yolie answered softly, &quot;as long as we are 
together.&quot;
