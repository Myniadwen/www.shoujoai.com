<a href="../digimon/darkguard-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>        &quot;You promised me,&quot; Lord Takato growled out angrily, &quot;that Lady 
Rika would be dead, and I&#39;d finally be able to ascend to the throne of 
the realm!&quot; He pushed his brown hair back from his face in a 
frustrated gesture, &quot;But that witch still lives!&quot;

        The man who was dressed all in black smiled a cold, dangerous 
little smile. &quot;What?&quot; he asked him softly.

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Devimon,&quot; Takato paled, taking a half step 
backward.

        &quot;It&#39;s quite all right,&quot; Devimon actually smiled slightly, but 
there was nothing at all warm in his steady gaze. With a name that was 
whispered to strike fear in the hearts of children across many 
nations, Devimon was not a man to cross lightly. &quot;I made a promise to 
you, and so did you to me,&quot; he reminded Takato firmly.

        The young man gulped loudly.

        &quot;If I removed the obstacle that Lady Rika has become to you,&quot; 
Devimon suddenly took a step forward, raising a black gloved hand to 
gently sweep some of Takato&#39;s hair from his face, &quot;you vowed to make 
the realm a haven to my assassin&#39;s guild.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll keep that promise,&quot; Takato stammered out.

        &quot;Then I will keep mine,&quot; Devimon said pleasantly. His eyes 
narrowed slightly as he added, &quot;I must make Renamon pay, for betraying 
the guild.&quot;

        &quot;I heard,&quot; Takato offered softly, &quot;that she slew your 
apprentice, Lady Devimon.&quot;

        &quot;That is yet another debt she owes me,&quot; Devimon smiled at him 
slightly then as he turned about, he simply disappeared.

        Takato looked about him wildly, gazing into the shadows of the 
chamber fearfully for a few moments until he felt certain that he was 
really gone. Then with a soft sigh he slumped down into the ornate 
chair at the head of his long dining table. An opulent meal was laid 
out for him, but suddenly the young man wasn&#39;t feeling hungry.

        &#39;For all those years I carefully groomed myself,&#39; Takato 
thought to himself glumly as he looked about the beautifully decorated 
dining hall of his family keep, &#39;presenting the perfect image of a 
sovereign so that I could be chosen to rule over the realm.&#39; A sudden 
scowl marked his face, &#39;But instead they chose that... damn child!&#39;

        Across his mind&#39;s eye images of the redheaded girl appeared, 
her honest shock at being chosen for the task, her earnest attempts to 
dissuade the council in naming her. &#39;Like any of the nobles really 
bought that innocent act,&#39; Takato thought to himself bitterly.

        To make matters worse, almost as soon as Rika had gained power 
she had begun to make sweeping changes to the entire realm. She 
ordered her taxes to be reduced, and forced the landowners all over 
the realm to do the same. She listened to the appeals of the common 
people, and actually leant their word the same weight as any of the 
noble born.

        And then there was the Kari and Yolie decision! Rika had 
completely ignored the traditional right of a nobleborn to marry off 
any unwed daughters, and now... Takato puffed out a furious breath. 
Now the daughters of nobility were actually beginning to speak out, to 
stand against the rightful rule of their fathers and brothers.

        Takato didn&#39;t know what hideous, evil plan that Rika was 
hatching next, but he just knew that it would have dire consequences 
for the entire realm.

        &quot;Would you like the red, blue or brown?&quot; Rika asked, holding 
up the bolts of fabric in the seamstress&#39; room.

        &quot;Brown, please,&quot; Renamon blinked, standing there in her human 
form amid all the clutter of the large chamber. A young seamstress 
circled her thoughtfully, in the process of fitting the slim young 
woman with some new clothes.

        Rika frowned slightly, &quot;Why did I know you were going to 
choose that?&quot; She shook her head, &quot;Why do you always choose such a 
plain color?&quot;

        Renamon smiled at her gently, &quot;Brown is a color that few 
notice, and it allows me to blend in easier. I&#39;d rather an enemy did 
not know I was there, until I&#39;m ready to strike.&quot;

        &quot;Hmm,&quot; Rika nodded, if a bit reluctantly. She brightened, &quot;But 
I&#39;m also having you fitted for one of our military uniforms. You can 
wear it to the next dance we hold.&quot;

        Renamon opened her mouth to protest that, then closed it with 
a soft snap. By the look on Rika&#39;s face it clearly meant a great deal 
to the young woman. &quot;All right,&quot; Renamon nodded to her slightly in 
defeat, &quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot;

        Rika smiled at her happily, &quot;Good.&quot; She paused a moment then 
added, &quot;I&#39;ll make sure to save the first dance for you.&quot;

        Renamon&#39;s eyes widened slightly. By ancient tradition the 
first dance of the ruler of the realm was saved for the wife or 
consort of that ruler. She smiled slightly, &quot;Are you sure about this, 
Rika? You know what sort of message that might send.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s the message that I want sent,&quot; Rika said seriously. A 
slight smile, &quot;I&#39;m in love with you, Renamon, and I do not care who 
knows about it.&quot;

        Renamon took a step forward, moving over to Rika&#39;s side. &quot;And 
I, you,&quot; she reached out to tenderly brush the shorter redhead&#39;s hair 
back. Rika tilted her face up slightly, eyes closed, and with a slight 
smile Renamon bent to press her lips to Rika&#39;s.

        They separated, and a smiling Rika noticed the seamstress&#39; 
wide eyed gaze. &quot;We rely on your discretion, Mimi,&quot; Rika gaze her a 
smile.

        &quot;Of course, my lady,&quot; Mimi curtsied slightly. She gave Renamon 
an admiring glance, &quot;Let&#39;s finish fitting your handsome young woman.&quot;

        Rika laughed softly, gently pushing the slightly uncomfortable 
looking Renamon toward her. &quot;It&#39;s times like this,&quot; Renamon muttered 
softly under her breath, &quot;that I wish I could easily transform my 
clothes, too.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s not so bad,&quot; Mimi smirked, &quot;with some of the more... 
lecherous nobles, I&#39;m not all that careful with my needles.&quot; She 
chuckled softly at the look on Renamon&#39;s face, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ve 
been a perfect gentleman.&quot;

        &quot;She is that,&quot; Rika agreed cheerfully. She looked over at 
Mimi, &quot;Could you take the measurements for my gown while you&#39;re here?&quot;

        &quot;At least someone else will have to go through this torture,&quot; 
Renamon muttered while bolts of fabric were pinned around her. &quot;Ow!&quot;

        &quot;Torture?&quot; Mimi waved a long needle about threateningly while 
Rika chuckled.

        A few moments after Mimi left, Renamon shifted back to her 
Kitsune form and gently pulled the smiling Rika into an embrace. 
Softly she murmured to her, &quot;You do know that she&#39;s the biggest gossip 
in town, right?&quot;

        &quot;Why do you think I hired her for this?&quot; Rika asked cheerfully 
as she snuggled into the warmth of Renamon&#39;s fur. Softly she added, 
&quot;This way my guests will all know what to expect, and there&#39;ll be no 
outcry.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re a very devious woman, Rika,&quot; Renamon said admiringly.

        Rika stepped back, going over to pour them each a glass of 
juice. She nodded her head to Renamon, &quot;I&#39;ve had a very good teacher.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;ve taught me a great deal as well,&quot; Renamon said 
innocently, smiling to herself slightly as Rika&#39;s cheeks colored.

        &quot;I have no idea what you mean,&quot; Rika smiled. She looked off 
into the distance thoughtfully, &quot;So much has changed in the months 
since you came into my life.&quot;

        &quot;No more than for me,&quot; Renamon agreed. She looked down, &quot;I&#39;ve 
never had a partner before, one who&#39;s life as value as much as my 
own.&quot;

        &quot;That almost sounds like our marriage vows,&quot; Rika murmured.

        &quot;Then why don&#39;t we?&quot; Renamon answered.

        Why don&#39;t we what?&quot; Rika looked over at her curiously.

        &quot;Get married,&quot; Renamon said. There was a long moment of 
silence as it finally registered, what Renamon just said.

        Rika was looking at her wide eyed. &quot;Did you just propose?&quot; she 
asked faintly.

        Renamon gulped. &quot;Yes,&quot; she said nervously, &quot;yes, I did.&quot;

        Tears glinted in Rika&#39;s eyes. &quot;Yes,&quot; she beamed, &quot;I accept.&quot;

        THWACK!

        Renamon shoved Rika down as the bolt flew in the open window, 
digging into the wall. She covered the girl&#39;s body with her own as 
Renamon gazed out the window, but the archer was gone. &quot;Are you all 
right?&quot; she asked Rika worriedly.

        &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Rika managed a smile. She frowned as she looked at 
the arrow buried in the wall, &quot;There&#39;s something tied on to it.&quot;

        Renamon tugged at the cord on the arrow, freeing a piece of 
parchment. She unfolded it carefully, reading it silently as her 
expression grew more and more grave.

        &quot;What is it?&quot; Rika finally had to ask.

        &quot;A challenge,&quot; Renamon finally said softly, &quot;from the master 
of the Assassin&#39;s guild.&quot;
