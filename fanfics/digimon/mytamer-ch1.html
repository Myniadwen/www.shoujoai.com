<h1>My Tamer</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cterror.html">Comrade Terror</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I&#146;ve been getting a lot of requests to do a Renaki fic, so I finally 
wrote one. Actually, this is probably my favorite Tamer couple. Not 
that I am a major Yuri fan, but I am a major fan of couples that are 
supported by the show. This is the one of the most show-supported 
couples. Even the US dub left most of the hints in. This has nothing 
to do with my other Tamer fics. As in all my stories, the Tamers and 
their friends are all 13. Also, in Japan, it is legal to have sex at 
13 so don&#146;t flame me for that. I use only Japanese names and attack 
names. I also use Japanese titles (san, chan, kun etc.). I will 
translate and Americanize for you at the end of the fic. Enough 
stalling, here&#146;s the good stuff:

------------------------------------------------------------

&#147;Matador Charge!&#148; I leapt over the charging bull-like creature. 
Bullmon were aggressive but not very smart. I, being a warrior, prided 
myself in my knowledge of the enemy. I landed on the ground and 
charged inward, leaving only two meters distance between my foe and 
myself. I did this because I knew he would not be able to use his 
changing attack at this close of range. Which meant he was like to 
rely of his secondary maneuver, &#147;Tail Whip!&#148; as usual I was correct. I 
caught the whipping tail in air and used it to draw my foe into a 
standing-sidekick.

The moment of stagger was all I needed, &#147;Wisteria Punch!&#148; I cried, 
sending out a small volley of razor-sharp Wisteria leaves. Although 
the green projectiles appeared to miss, each leave cut my adversary as 
it passed by. A Child form Digimon might have fallen, but Bullmon was 
an Armor type so he required a little more &#145;persuasion&#146;.

&#147;Finish him off,&#148; my Tamer, Makino Ruki, commanded. Her voice was firm 
but yet I could sense something more within the words. Something&#133;

My opponent growled, waking me from my brief distraction. A fatal 
error, I leapt into the air, my limbs and back curled my form into a 
ball like shape. Once I felt I had built significant energy for my 
task, I uncurled into my normal shape, &#147;Fox Leaf Arrowhead!&#148; I shouted 
my attack, an instinct that comes naturally for a Digimon. More 
Wisteria leaves appeared around me. This time, however, they were not 
the traditional green. They glowed white with the energy I had 
bestowed upon them. They pointed themselves at the bull and rained 
down destruction upon him. He didn&#146;t have a chance. His body broke up 
into tiny life force particles, or data, as I believe Ruki calls it. 
In the past, I would have absorbed his life force to use with my own. 
Recently, however, I had discovered that the energy from my Tamer 
could provide me with more power than any life force would ever hope 
to.

I landed on the ground and looked at my Tamer. Her warm violet eyes 
showed her pride in me. She walked slowly, almost methodically, to my 
position. She looked up at me, smiling, &#147;Good job, Renamon,&#148; she spoke 
my name softly as she wrapped her arms around my neck and brought her 
lips into contact with my own.

------------------------------------------------------------

I jolted awake, panting heavily. The sun was just beginning to peek 
over the eastern horizon, casting its golden glow upon the land. I sat 
up on the branch I was sleeping on. That dream, my mind was still 
groggy, but I could remember every bit of it. It was far from the 
first time I had dreamt it. All of the dreams were different, yet all 
of them seemed to end with a common theme, Ruki&#146;s love for me.

A love I was not even sure existed outside of my own mind. I knew Ruki 
cared for me, even if her words never expressed it. This, however, was 
far deeper than caring. This was love. Love, knowing that your heart 
belongs to your lover and hers to you, enjoying another&#146;s presence, 
missing that presence when she isn&#146;t there and then, of course, there 
is physical side of love.

I mentally smacked myself for drifting into that area of my mind. Why 
am I thinking this? She was not even my species. How could she ever 
love me as more than a friend? She could not. Simple as that, she 
could not. 

I stood up and stretched, taking in a large breath of morning air in 
the process. I jumped down from my perch in the tree and walked over 
to the door to Ruki&#146;s room. Quietly, I slid it open and examined my 
tamer&#146;s sleeping form. I couldn&#146;t help but notice how beautiful she 
was. Her chest rose and fell under the blankets, and I found my own 
breathing matching hers. Her violet eyes were closed and her silky 
hair poured a sea of red across her pillow. I had always liked her 
hair better when she let it down. Of course, none of these things I 
could ever tell her. I sighed and turned to leave.

&#147;Renamon, is that you?&#148; Ruki&#146;s voice sleepily asked.

&#147;Yes,&#148; I softly said.

&#147;What are you doing?&#148;

Admiring you, my beautiful tamer. If only I could have said that 
aloud, &#147;Nothing. I thought I heard you call for me. I am sorry for 
waking you,&#148; I hated lying to her, but she could never accept the 
truth. I left her room, shutting the door after myself.

I felt a droplet of water hit my chest fur. I looked toward the sky 
but saw no clouds. I brought a hand to my face and felt what I had 
feared. I was crying. I wondered how long I had been crying. It was 
not the first time, and probably would not be the last. I sat 
cross-legged on the cool grass and buried my face in my purple gloves, 
&#147;I love you Ruki-chan,&#148; I mumbled in between sobs.

------------------------------------------------------------

I was watching myself walking through a forest in the Digital World. I 
knew I must have been dreaming again. I soon recognized my 
surroundings. This was the place where it had happened. Where she had 
entered my life. I watched the form that was myself as it walked 
toward its destiny.

&#147;Soon, I will be stronger. I will be the best. I must be,&#148; I heard my 
doppelganger speak. I was so na&iuml;ve back then. Caring only for power, 
wanting only to be the strongest Digimon I could be. That is why I 
sought for Ruki. She was the best, the only one worthy of being my 
tamer. She would help me become stronger. I never thought of her as 
being more than a partner.

I watched as my past self stepped past the other Digimon. Ones that 
had come with the same intent as me, become Ruki&#146;s partner. A pillar 
of light engulfed her body as she looked for the last time at the 
world she had known.

I now found myself outside the Makino home. This was not any memory I 
recognized. I watched as yet another version of myself leapt from tree 
to tree. She landed next to a girl I knew very well.

&#147;Ruki-san?&#148; she spoke. I still found it odd hearing my voice come from 
another as I stood quietly watching the two figures interact.

&#147;What do you need, Renamon?&#148; even in the dream, her voice was melodic 
to me.

&#147;I have something I need to tell you. Something I have felt for a long 
time,&#148; my eyes widened. She could be going to say that, could she?

&#147;What is it?&#148;

&#147;Ruki-san, I love you.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;I love you. I have felt this way for some time, but was afraid to 
tell you.&#148;

&#147;You love me?&#148;

&#147;Yes, she loves you,&#148; I found myself speaking, although neither of the 
individuals acted as if they had heard me.

&#147;You&#146;re just data. How can you feel love?&#148;

&#147;We Digimon have emotions too.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry, Renamon. I just don&#146;t think I can love you in that way. 
You aren&#146;t even a real creature. You&#146;re just data,&#148; I was sure her 
words cut as deeply into the heart this Renamon as they did into mine.

The other Renamon grasped Ruki by the shoulders softly, &#147;Please 
Ruki-san, I love you.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry Renamon,&#148; she repeated.

&#147;Please just let me show you how much you mean to me,&#148; the other 
Renamon hugged Ruki closer.

Ruki slapped her across the cheek, &#147;I said no. What&#146;s wrong with you? 
I thought I knew you, but I guess I was wrong,&#148; she turned and walked 
away.

As I watched as the clone of myself sobbed with the pain of her broken 
heart, I couldn&#146;t help but allow my own hurt to flow in a river of 
tears. The other Renamon held her arm out towards Ruki and spoke 
softly, &#147;I love you Ruki-san.&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

Again, I awoke with a start. I had been resting in the park after my 
routine morning workout when I had had that dream. What was it all 
about? Was it some kind of premonition? No, that cannot be. I would 
never be forceful with Ruki, and she has never struck me before. 
Still, I could not get the dream from my mind.

Perhaps this was some kind of sign. A warning, something to prevent me 
from making a horrible mistake. I glanced upward at the sun, using it 
to tell time, and gasped. I had overslept, Ruki must have returned 
from her classes a while ago.

I stood up and jumped into the air, leaping from treetops, light poles 
and any other tall objects. I usually traveled in this method. I 
enjoyed the stealth and quietness it gave me. Soon, I arrived at the 
Makino home. I made my way to Ruki&#146;s room via the rooftop. I checked 
for any other human presences. When I was sure there were none, I 
landed on the ground and walked to the door.

&#147;You can come in, Renamon,&#148; Ruki called from within her room. I often 
wondered how she knew when I was near. I entered the room. Ruki was 
sitting at a small table organizing her Digimon cards. She gave me a 
curious look, &#147;Where were you? You&#146;re always right there when I get 
home but today you weren&#146;t. I was&#133;&#148; she trailed off, but I knew what 
she was going to say.

&#147;I am sorry for making you worry. I overslept,&#148; I said, stepping 
forward.

Her facial expression shifted from curiosity to concern, &#147;Have you 
been crying?&#148;

I gasped and brought a hand quickly to my face. My fur was still very 
moist. In my hurry to get back to her I had forgotten about it. I 
could not tell her the truth. I was painfully forced to lie again, &#147;I 
was washing before I came here,&#148; I realized my slip immediately.

Ruki cocked an eyebrow, &#147;You said you were sleeping. Renamon, what&#146;s 
wrong?&#148;

&#147;I cannot say.&#148;

&#147;Please tell me. I am&#133;&#148; after some silence, she finally finished, &#147;I 
care about you. I don&#146;t want to see you hurting, physically or 
emotionally,&#148; her tender words pieced through any defenses I had left.

Even if it cost me her friendship, I had to tell her, &#147;Ruki-san I&#133;&#148; 
the image of the dream Renamon and her fate popped into my mind. I 
quickly shook it off and, using all my courage, preceded, &#147;I love you. 
I want to be more than just your partner and friend, but if you do 
not, I will understand,&#148; I prayed that my words would be met warmly.

Ruki sat in silence for what seemed like an eternity. Finally, she 
spoke softly, &#147;I love you too. Somehow, I feel like I always have. I 
just was&#133;well, I was&#133;&#148;

&#147;Afraid it would ruin our friendship,&#148; I finished for her.

She smiled so warmly that it practically made my body temperature rise 
just looking at her, &#147;Yes, that it exactly. I&#146;m so sorry I didn&#146;t say 
this. I&#146;m sorry I caused you to cry. I love you Renamon.&#148; 

She threw her arms around me and hugged me tightly. Without 
hesitation, I hugged back, enjoying the warmth of my tamer&#146;s body. I 
looked down into her eyes. For a brief moment, we peered into each 
other&#146;s souls. We leaned forward at a slow, almost grueling, pace. At 
last my dream was realized as her lips met my muzzle. This was no 
dream; it was one hundred percent real. I was slightly surprised when 
I felt her tongue pressing through my lips, but made no effort to 
resist. We continued the kiss for a few minutes, yet it seemed to end 
so fast. We gasped for air but still never broke the embrace.

She looked into my eyes once again. I knew exactly what she was 
thinking, &#147;Ruki-chan, we should not. We cannot just&#133;&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t see why not,&#148; she interjected in a very reassuring tone. I 
closed my eyes and moaned softly as I felt her hands moving on my 
back. Slowly, lower, and lower, until they were&#133;

&#147;Ruki, time for dinner!&#148; Hata Seiko, Ruki&#146;s grandmother, called.

My tamer sighed with the same frustration I felt, &#147;Coming 
grandmother!&#148; she yelled. She then turned to me, &#147;I&#146;m sorry. I&#146;ll be 
back.&#148;

Some time later, Ruki returned from eating with a plate of food for 
me. I had had little appetite lately yet tonight I finished the entire 
plate. I attributed it to the fact that my depression was gone. As I 
was finishing the last piece of fish, Ruki&#146;s D-arc began glowing. A 
familiar site, it usually indicated the presence of a rogue Digimon.

&#147;Ready for battle?&#148;

&#147;I always am.&#148;

Usually Ruki would have an out by now, but she turned to face me and 
spoke in a quite tone, &#147;Maybe later we can have a little battle of our 
own,&#148; she smirked as she headed out the door. I smiled at the prospect 
and followed her.

------------------------------------------------------------

The battle thus far had been routine and almost monotonous. The 
blue-skinned, twin bokken wielding, Yashamon was not a weak Digimon, 
but with my warrior skill and finesse, as well as a few timely card 
slashes, I was in complete control. What would happen next, however, 
would surprise even me.

In a move of desperation the rogue Yashamon charged toward Ruki, 
&#147;Ruki-chan, look out!&#148; I called, but she was too paralyzed with shock 
to move. I moved to her with breakneck speed. I leapt into the air as 
the Yashamon was doing a double cross-slash with his weapons. I was 
able to kick the first bokken away but not the second. It collided 
hard with Ruki&#146;s left ankle. She yelped in pain and collapsed, 
grasping her wounded ankle.

In a fit of rage, I attacked the Yashamon. Punches and kicks flew at 
lightning speed until he stumbled back onto the ground. I jumped into 
the air and charged my attack quickly, &#147;Fox Leaf Arrowhead!&#148; my foe 
was dispatched, but I had other concerns. I ran to Ruki and knelt at 
her side, &#147;Ruki-chan are you ok?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m fine,&#148; she said, although the swelling in her leg indicated she 
clearly was not.

&#147;Let me see it,&#148; I ran my hand gently across the wounded area, 
checking to see if it was broken. Part of being a warrior was being 
able to analyze wounds, both on yourself and others. Ruki gritted her 
teeth but did not cry out. I sighed with relief, &#147;It is not broken, 
just badly bruised,&#148; Ruki tried to stand but collapsed again, &#147;What 
are you doing?&#148;

&#147;Going home. It&#146;s getting late,&#148; she answered pointing to the sky.

&#147;I will carry you.&#148;

&#147;No, I can do it,&#148; she started to try to stand again. It pained me to 
see her struggle. I knew even if it killed her, she would never ask 
anyone for help, even me. Without warning I scooped her into my arms, 
&#147;Hey! You don&#146;t have to...&#148;

&#147;I know I do not have to, but I want to,&#148; I smiled down to her and she 
smiled back.

------------------------------------------------------------

We arrived quietly at Ruki&#146;s home. I carried Ruki slowly through the 
hall. I saw her grandmother resting in a chair. She looked as if she 
had been reading a book and fallen asleep. There were no signs of 
Ruki&#146;s mother. Based on what Ruki had told me, I assumed her mother 
was out &#145;dating&#146; with another human. I carried Ruki to her room and 
lay her softly on her bed area of the floor, &#147;How is your ankle?&#148; I 
asked softly, kneeling beside her.

&#147;I&#146;ll be fine,&#148; she answered, determined as ever. She wrapped her arms 
around me back, &#147;Thank you, Renamon. Not just for today, but for all 
the times you&#146;ve helped me,&#148; she pulled me down into a passionate 
kiss. It probably lasted several minutes but again it seemed to end so 
quickly. Ruki, however, was far from done, &#147;Don&#146;t go Renamon. Sleep 
here, with me,&#148; her words were of utmost sincerity.

&#147;But Ruki-chan, I failed you today. I should have been there to 
protect you, but I failed. You deserve a better protector than me.&#148;

&#147;No you didn&#146;t. You never have. If it wasn&#146;t for you I&#133;&#148; she fidgeted 
for a moment, &#147;I would never have felt love. I want you Rena-chan, no 
one else,&#148; I sighed she rubbed my outer tight. She had never called me 
chan before.

&#147;Thank you, Ruki-chan,&#148; a small gasp escaped my mouth as her hand 
worked its way around to my backside, &#147;I know you love me. You do not 
have to&#133;&#148; my words were silenced as she placed a finger to my lips.

&#147;I know I don&#146;t have to, but I want to,&#148; she said, repeating my words 
from earlier, &#147;Please, let me do this for you,&#148; the hand that was once 
on my mouth bushed slowly down across my chest fur.

My mind and body gave in to the pleasure as I lay down next to my 
tamer. Putting her body weight on her knees, she sat up and straddled 
me. Her hands made circular motions on my sensitive chest area, 
stimulating the breasts under the fur. I tried not to moan, as I knew 
her grandmother was sleeping but a few rooms away. She leaned down and 
kissed me once again. I found my hands probing her, slowly reaching 
under her T-shirt to feel the soft skin beneath. Another moan was 
heard, this time from Ruki, as I massaged the small of her back. Our 
tongues continued their dance of love as our body temperatures rose. 
Ruki was first to break the kiss.

&#147;Rena-chan,&#148; she whimpered softly in my ear. She pushed away from my 
face and lifted her shirt over her head, letting it fall to the floor. 
Her small white bra was the next thing to go, leaving me with my first 
look at her human breasts. She had changed with me in the room before, 
but I had always looked away. I would never betray her trust and did 
not want to see her in this manner unless I truly felt she wanted me 
to. Hoping it would provide her with the same pleasure, I retch up 
with my arms and made the same massaging motion she had done for me. 
Her soft moaning indicated her pleasure as I continued my treatment.

She grasped my hands softly and pulled them away, &#147;Relax, I want to do 
this for you,&#148; she said in a voice so tender it aroused me just 
hearing it. I lay my hands on the ground and obeyed. She went down 
once again, this time kissing at my chest. I closed my eyes as I felt 
them. Small kisses here and there, working there way down. Down to my 
upper abdomen, my stomach, my waist and to my&#133;

&#147;Ruki-chan, are you sure?&#148; I asked, know her next destination.

&#147;Very sure,&#148; she said, resuming the kissing.

&#147;Ohh, Ruki-chan,&#148; I moaned out the second her lips hit my outer folds. 
I had allowed no one, not human, Digimon, male or female to touch me 
there. Nor had I ever touched myself there. I felt I was saving myself 
for someone special, someone who I could give my heart and body to, 
someone, like her. I moaned out again as her tongue hit my special 
area. It was like she knew just what to do, but yet, I knew she had 
never been with another. Unless she, &#147;Ruki-chan, have you ever thought 
about this before?&#148;

She stopped and looked at me, blushing slightly, &#147;Sometimes, I dream 
about this, about us.&#148;

I smiled at her, &#147;So do I,&#148; she smiled back and went back to her labor 
of love. I could help but moan out loud as her tongue ran across the 
super-sensitive bulb of my sex. Her tongue continued by exploring my 
insides, stimulating the sensitive walls. Ruki&#146;s eyes were closed as 
she focused all her attention to me. I placed my hand on either side 
of her head, running them through her hair. In the process, I 
accidentally pulled off her hair band, allowing her red hair to fall 
across my crotch. Ruki began a thrusting motion with her tongue. In 
and out, increasing my need for release. All the while, her hands were 
rubbing the lips of my pussy. Empowered by hormones, I used my hands 
to push her face and tongue deeper into me. I knew my climax was 
close. She must have to, because she increased the speed of her tongue 
thrusts. Bring her hand down and squeezing my clit was the final 
stimulation I needed.

&#147;Ruki-chan!&#148; I groaned out loud and arched my back sharply. My sexual 
juices flowed out of me as my body was washed in orgasmic pleasure. To 
my surprise, Ruki continued licking me throughout my climax. Whether 
she enjoyed the taste or did it as a token of love, I would never 
know. As my orgasm settled, I relaxed back into a laying position on 
Ruki&#146;s bed area.

When she was sure I was done, Ruki stopped her licking and snuggled 
close to me, &#147;How was that?&#148; she whispered.

I panted some more before finally answering, &#147;That was wonderful. 
Thank you so much, Ruki-chan.&#148;

&#147;If you wouldn&#146;t have come forward with your feelings we might never 
have been together. I&#146;m the one that should thank you.&#148;

I looked over at her and smiled, &#147;You have not had your turn,&#148; I 
rolled on top of her, &#147;yet,&#148; I positioned myself at her chest, careful 
to avoid her wounded ankle, and cupped my mouth around one of her 
breasts. I made my tongue make a circular motion around her nipple 
until it became hard from the treatment. I flicked the hard nipple 
with my tongue as I sucked lightly at her. I repeated the procedure of 
her other breast. Her constant moaning was beckoning me to proceed. I 
felt her arms on my head, rubbing behind my long-pointed ears. She did 
not know, but this was a very sensitive and pleasureful area for me. I 
moaned out slightly, attempting to tell her to continue. All the while 
my hands were at work undoing her jeans. I pulled away from my sucking 
and her caress and pulled her jeans off. Despite my care, Ruki groaned 
slightly as I pulled the left leg of her pants. I looked 
apologetically at her.

&#147;I told you it&#146;s not your fault. Please keep going, I have wanted this 
for so long,&#148; looking into her eyes, I could not resist even if I had 
wanted to. Only her purple, lace panties clothed her now. I gently 
pulled them off as well. I stopped for a moment, gazing at my tamer&#146;s 
body. She was more beautiful than I could ever have imagined. I shook 
out of my daze and focused on my task, pleasing her. 

I place my hand onto her sex and rubbed softly, &#147;Do you like that?&#148; I 
asked, knowing the answer but wanting to hear it from her.

&#147;Mmm hmm&#133;&#148; Ruki moaned out.

&#147;Then you&#146;ll really like this,&#148; I assured, leaning my muzzle down to 
her sex. I exhaled, breathing warm, stimulating air over her moist 
snatch. I licked her outer lips lightly, teasing her for what was to 
come. My tongue was naturally rough, which only added to Ruki&#146;s 
pleasure as she whimpered my name softly. I lapped at her sacred area 
again, tasting her juices. It was certainly deferent from anything I 
had tasted before. It was not the best tasting fluid, but just knowing 
that it caused her pleasure made it all the sweeter. Once again, I 
found her hands massaging the sensitive area behind my ears. I moaned 
into Ruki, causing her to shudder in pleasure. In my oral probing, my 
tongue brushed her clit lightly. Seeing the good reaction from my 
tamer, I tried something new. I wrapped my lips around the nub as best 
I could, suck and licking it as I had her breasts. Ruki groaned out 
loud and thrust her hips into my muzzle. I stopped, not wanting her 
experience to end so quickly, and resumed licking her pussy lips.

&#147;Rena-chan, that feels so good,&#148; Ruki moaned. As she continued rubbing 
my ears, I brought a hand down and began giving my own sex some 
relief. Meanwhile, I entered her with my tongue and began the same 
thrusting motion she had given me earlier. I pushed further into her, 
the tip of my muzzle entering her canal. My tongue thrust as deep as 
possible, tasting more of Ruki&#146;s bittersweet fluid. As my own need for 
release grew, I began thrusting two clawed fingers in and out of my 
own slit. Ruki&#146;s breathing was now very labored, &#147;Rena-chan, I&#146;m going 
to cum,&#148; she panted out. I gave her one final long, deep, lick before 
I felt her inner walls contact and squeeze at my tongue and muzzle. 
She cried my name as her hands stopped rubbing and grasped my head, 
holding it in position. My mouth was flooded with a juice that tasted 
so much better. I now knew why Ruki had enjoyed it so much. I greedily 
lapped at her as I sped up my own finger thrusts. Ruki&#146;s hips and 
hands finally fell away from my face. Using my knees to support me, I 
rubbed the bulb of my sex with a feverish lust. I finally groaned with 
relief, my juices spilling onto my hand as my second orgasm passed 
through my body, and collapsed on the bed area next to Ruki.

We both just lied there for a while. No words were said. None were 
needed. Ruki was the first to break the silence, &#147;Thank you, for 
tonight.&#148;

&#147;I love you Ruki-chan,&#148; I said, snuggling up to her.

&#147;I love you, too. I&#146;m so glad you choose me as your tamer.&#148;

&#147;I knew you were the best. I just&#133;&#148; I blushed under my yellow fur, &#147;I 
just did not know how right I was.&#148;

Ruki blushed a little and smiled. She pulled the cover over our bodies 
and whispered softly to me,  &#147;Good night, Rena-chan.&#148;

&#147;Good night, Ruki-chan,&#148; we kissed once more before settling in to 
sleep. I hugged her closely, sharing my body heat with her. She closer 
her violet eyes and drifted off to sleep. I soon joined her. Her, she 
was my friend, my tamer, my lover.

------------------------------------------------------------

Translate-O-Matic:

Ruki=Rika

Hata Seiko=? (If anyone can tell me Ruki&#146;s grandmother&#146;s name in the 
US dub, I&#146;d be grateful. Sorry, but I just don&#146;t watch the dub version 
that much.)

Yashamon=Yasyamon

San=Mr./Mrs./Miss

Chan=a title given to close friend, childhood friend, close sibling or 
boy/girlfriend

Author&#146;s Notes: Well, I hope you enjoyed it. I certainly liked writing 
this. As usual I tried to keep it as in character as I could. Yes, 
Renamon did live in the Digital World before joining Ruki, and it is 
also true that she only joined her originally in the hope of becoming 
more powerful. I don&#146;t know if any of that was changed in the dub but 
that is the way it was in Japan. (Aside from the forest thing. I made 
that up for plot purposes) A bokken is like a heavy solid wood sword. 
To any of you are reading my &#147;A Way to My Heart&#148; series, Chapter four 
is over halfway done. It should be up in a week. (Maybe two if I&#146;m 
busy) Also, for anyone who liked my humor fic &#147;Christmas Wasn&#146;t Meant 
to be Tamed&#148;, I will be starting a Deva humor series soon. Enough with 
the shameless self-promoting, as always R&amp;R. Don&#146;t flame me because I 
won&#146;t bother to read them. However, like any writer, I want to improve 
my skills so if you have any constructive criticism, feel free to 
submit it.

Signed as always,

The &sect;upreme &Oslash;verlord of &ETH;arkness</pre>
