<h1>Dark Guardian: A Tale of Rika and Renamon (part 7 of 12)</h1>

<a href="../digimon/darkguard-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>        They lay there in the sun for an unknown length of time, 
Renamon gently holding the slimmer body of Rika close to her own. The 
girl&#39;s breathing gradually dropped off, and Renamon realized that she 
had fallen asleep.

        &#39;Must have been the wine,&#39; Renamon thought with a smile.

        Rika&#39;s red hair fell gently about her face. A beautiful, 
lively face, that was rendered peaceful by the balm of sleep. She was 
such a mass of contradictions, Renamon wondered if she would ever 
fully understand her. She could be as hard as rock guarding the honor 
of her lands, but also held a gentle side, like when she granted Kari 
and Yolie&#39;s petition. She always sought to do what she thought was 
right, no matter the personal cost.

        &#39;And what of I?&#39; Renamon wondered. She still didn&#39;t understand 
the instant connection she had felt upon meeting Rika. She didn&#39;t know 
why she couldn&#39;t slay the girl as commanded by the guildmaster. And 
she certainly didn&#39;t understand how a girl like Rika had so quickly 
become the focus of her entire existence. But Rika was that focus, 
there was no denying that.

        Rika snuggled in a bit closer to the warmth of Renamon&#39;s fur. 
&#39;And what will I do when the time comes for her to leave me?&#39; Renamon 
wondered. Someday, she would find a way to stop the assassins of Lord 
Takato, freeing Rika from needing her as a bodyguard. &#39;And what will 
happen to me then?&#39; she thought sadly.

        Rika stirred, then she looked up sleepily into Renamon&#39;s eyes 
with her own shockingly green ones, &quot;I would never ask you to leave 
me.&quot;

        &quot;I... said that aloud?&quot; Renamon blinked in honest surprise.

        &quot;No,&quot; Rika shook her head, her own eyes widening somewhat. &quot;I 
heard what you were thinking, when you were holding me,&quot; Rika 
murmured.

        &#39;What on earth?&#39; Renamon wondered. She stepped away from Rika 
carefully to ask her, &quot;Did you hear that?&quot;

        &quot;No,&quot; Rika looked a bit shaken, &quot;it only seems to work when we 
are touching.&quot;

        Renamon nodded slightly, and Rika could see from the grave 
expression on her face that she was thinking furiously. &quot;First I will 
take you back home,&quot; she finally said, &quot;Then I will leave immediately, 
never to return.&quot;

        &quot;No!&quot; Rika exclaimed, then softly, &quot;Why?&quot;

        Renamon hesitated, &quot;You heard my thoughts, Rika.&quot; More softly 
she added, &quot;You know how I feel about...&quot; she trailed off.

        &quot;Me,&quot; Rika nodded thoughtfully. Gathering up her will Rika met 
Renamon&#39;s eyes, &quot;If I have become the focus of your life, so too have 
you become the focus of mine. To be parted from you, it would be like 
losing a part of myself.&quot;

        &quot;Rika, you don&#39;t understand,&quot; Renamon started to say, only to 
be cut off by the younger woman&#39;s curt gesture.

        &quot;You&#39;re right, I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Rika said intensely, &quot;I 
don&#39;t understand why having you protect me makes my heart skip a beat. 
I don&#39;t understand why I can miss you even when you&#39;re gone only a few 
moments.&quot; She smiled wryly, &quot;I don&#39;t understand why, when you&#39;re 
holding me in your arms, I want you to do so much more.&quot;

        At that last statement, Renamon blushed slightly, making Rika 
wonder if she too might share that certain desire.

        &quot;I don&#39;t understand any of it,&quot; Rika smiled gently. &quot;But the 
only way either of us will ever understand,&quot; she finished, &quot;is if we 
stay together.&quot;

        &quot;I didn&#39;t know,&quot; Renamon said softly. She smiled at Rika 
tentatively, and Rika felt her heart lift as she smiled back.

        &quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Rika quietly asked her.

        With a teasing little smile Renamon said, &quot;First we get you 
dressed, then I&#39;ll take us both home. And together we&#39;ll try to figure 
out what&#39;s going on.&quot;

        Rika flushed a bit, noticing that yes, she was still prancing 
about in just her bra and panties. With all the excitement, she had 
forgotten her state of undress. She quickly picked up her now dry 
clothes from the grass with a slight blush, &quot;Good idea.&quot;

        Renamon kept her head averted while she packed the wine and 
food away in the storage cache, only rising one Rika gave her a wave. 
She offered her hand to the girl, &quot;Shall we?&quot;

        Rika took that hand, bracing herself for another rush of 
thoughts and feelings, only to feel nothing unusual. &quot;It didn&#39;t happen 
again,&quot; Rika said softly.

        &quot;No, it didn&#39;t,&quot; Renamon agreed, &quot;interesting.&quot; She swept Rika 
up into her arms again, holding the girl close.

        &quot;I wonder why?&quot; a frowning Rika wondered. It had been very 
strange, feeling and thinking what Renamon had done, but it had also 
felt good, somehow. She was even a bit surprised to realize that she 
actually missed it.

        &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Renamon murmured as they left the little 
oasis. &quot;I wish I knew more about my kind,&quot; she said as she silently 
made her way down the cliff and into the forest, &quot;such knowledge might 
answer a great many of our questions.&quot;

        &quot;There is a man who claims to be a mystic in the village,&quot; 
Rika offered, &quot;he says that he knows a great deal of the creatures of 
magic. He might be able to help.&quot;

        &quot;Indeed,&quot; Renamon murmured thoughtfully, &quot;what is his name?&quot;

        &quot;Henry, I believe,&quot; Rika frowned.

        They moved through the forest greenery almost completely 
silently, swiftly coming into sight of the small town. Stealthily they 
made their way unobserved to the castle itself, then finally up to 
Rika&#39;s own set of bed chambers. Renamon put Rika down gently, and for 
just a moment Rika got a flash of reluctance from Renamon.

        The kitsune straightened smoothly, &quot;We should let Rio know 
that we&#39;ve returned.&quot;

        &quot;Do we have to?&quot; Rika sighed.

        Renamon was visibly fighting back a smile as she said, &quot;The 
poor fellow had been dealing with your absence for nearly a day. We 
can at least let him know you&#39;ve back.&quot;

        &quot;He&#39;s going to yell at me again,&quot; Rika noted.

        The smile Renamon gave her was wicked, &quot;You mean, he&#39;ll try to 
yell at you.&quot;

        Rika had to smile back, &quot;True.&quot;

        Thankfully, Rio was so happy at finally having Rika back home 
that he didn&#39;t even yell at her. Also, the forbidding presence of 
Renamon glowering down at him probably also helped in his decision to 
hold his tongue.

        Tired, Rika began to retire for the night under Renamon&#39;s 
thoughtful gaze. Rika climbed into her bed, then she looked up at 
Renamon expectantly.

        &quot;What?&quot; Renamon blinked.

        &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to guard me from nightmares?&quot; Rika asked 
with a little smile.

        &quot;I thought... well, after today...&quot; Renamon fumbled.

        &quot;Please?&quot; Rika mustered as much appeal as she could and put it 
in her eyes.

        &quot;Oh course,&quot; Renamon gently lay down by Rika, enfolding her 
safely in her arms.
