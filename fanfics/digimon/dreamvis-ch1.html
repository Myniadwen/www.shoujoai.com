<h1>Dreams and Visions</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>        She stumbled through the many curtains, pushing them aside as 
she fought onward. She finally entered an open space, looking around 
her dazedly. A figure appeared from the shadows, a pale ghost emerging 
from the darkness.

        Angewomon&#39;s wings stretched outward from her nude back. Her 
normal armor and clothes were gone, pink flesh visible in the shadows. 
Only her traditional helm remained, fully concealing her face while 
letting long hair flow free. She turned slightly to look at her, and 
then she reached up to remove the helmet.

        The young woman felt her breath coming faster, an anxiousness 
taking her over. &#39;What&#39;s wrong with me?&#39; she fretted.

        The helm dropped to the floor with the sound of a ringing 
bell, and Kari&#39;s face smiled up at her, her much shorter brown hair 
framing her angelic face as she walked towards her...

        And Yolie woke up gasping, faintly out of breath. &#39;Where in 
the world did that come from?&#39; she thought, a blush flaming on her 
cheeks. With a shaking hand she pushed her long hair back, sitting up 
by leaning on her other hand.

        &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Hawkmon&#39;s refined voice asked her. She 
noticed he was perched on the end of her bed, looking over at her 
quizzically.

        &quot;Bad dream,&quot; Yolie answered, still blushing faintly. She heard 
the phone ring, but still sat there, feeling too off balance to pick 
it up.

        In another apartment in a different part of the city, Kari 
held the phone to her ear, counting the rings absently. At ten, she 
finally hung up with a sigh.

        &quot;You dreamed about her again, didn&#39;t you?&quot; Gatomon asked 
softly. The cat digimon was sitting on the desk by Kari, looking up at 
her in concern.

        &quot;Yeah,&quot; Kari sighed.

        It had been an odd dream, with her as Angewomon and, oddly, 
entirely nude. She had waited for Yolie to arrive before removing her 
helmet and welcoming her with a smile. She blushed furiously as she 
thought, &#39;I&#39;m almost sorry the dream ended there.&#39;

        &quot;She&#39;s not answering her phone, huh?&quot; Gatomon said 
sympathetically. She jumped down agilely, &quot;So why not go over and see 
her?&quot;

        &quot;What?&quot; Kari looked surprised.

        Gatomon flicked her tail in a very catlike gesture, &quot;It&#39;s not 
like she can ignore you if you&#39;re standing there at her door.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Kari said with a firm nod. She grabbed her bag 
and held it open for Gatomon to climb into, and she was off.

        Yolie puttered about her kitchen, for a moment wishing she was 
a better cook. Looking over her shoulder, &quot;Anything you&#39;d like for 
breakfast, Hawkmon?&quot;

        &quot;Whatever you&#39;re having is fine,&quot; the hawk digimon said 
cheerfully. Hawkmon gave her a considering look, &quot;That dream&#39;s still 
bothering you, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

        &quot;Yeah, it is,&quot; Yolie admitted. She looked off into the 
distance, her glasses sitting a bit oddly on her face. &quot;I&#39;ve always 
felt a connection with Kari,&quot; she admitted, &quot;even before we discovered 
that you and Gatomon could DNA digivolve together. But this feels... 
different.&quot;

        &quot;Are you in love with her?&quot; Hawkmon asked directly.

        Yolie blushed, looking down. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she admitted 
softly. She shook her head, &quot;I mean, I like her, a lot, and I want to 
be near her.&quot; With a sweet little smile, &quot;And the sun shines when she 
smiles at me.&quot;

        &quot;You are in love,&quot; Hawkmon said with a firm nod.

        Yolie sighed softly, &quot;Yeah, I guess I am.&quot; She looked out the 
kitchen window anxiously, &quot;But how can I tell her? I mean ..&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s not easy,&quot; Hawkmon admitted. &quot;It took a bit of time 
before I could tell the one that I loved,&quot; he smiled, &quot;but I&#39;m glad 
that I did.&quot;

        &quot;You might be right,&quot; Yolie admitted, then she did a 
doubletake as his last sentence fully registered. &quot;You&#39;re in love? Who 
is it?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;It&#39;s,&quot; Hawkmon started to say, when the doorbell rang.

        &quot;Saved by the bell&quot;&quot; Yolie chuckled, &quot;you go hide while I 
answer this.&quot; She walked over and pulled the door open before checking 
who it was, then froze.

        Kari smiled up at Yolie, &quot;Good morning.&quot; The two stood there 
for a few moments before she hesitantly continued, &quot;Could we come in?&quot;

        &quot;Oh, right,&quot; Yolie blushed, waving Kari in. &quot;We? You brought 
Gatomon with you?&quot;

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Kari set her bag down, unzipping it so that the catlike 
digimon could climb out.

        &quot;Hi, Yolie,&quot; Gatomon said as she stretched. &quot;Hawkmon,&quot; she 
cried out, and bounced towards him happily. Kawkmon looked a bit 
embarrassed as Gatomon rubbed up against him, and Yolie realized whom 
he was going to say he was in love with.

        Kari had a similar look of revelation on her face, &quot;So 
kawaii.&quot; She shook herself and looked up at Yolie, &quot;I was worried 
about you. You didn&#39;t answer your phone when I called.&quot;

        Yolie winced, &quot;I didn&#39;t know it was you, or I would have 
answered.&quot;

        &quot;Something&#39;s wrong,&quot; Kari murmured, taking Yolie&#39;s hands in 
hers. She took Yolie&#39;s hand whenever she could, actually. It made her 
feel safe, even when things were getting crazy.

        Yolie nodded slightly. She could feel her heart pounding in 
her chest, a chill sweat on her body as she softly said, &quot;I&#39;m in love 
with you.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Kari answered with a serene smile on her face. 
Softly, &quot;I&#39;ve been in love with you since you told me I was 
beautiful.&quot;

        Yolie looked vaguely like she had been hit on the back of the 
head. Recovering a bit she managed, &quot;So what do we do now?&quot;

        Kari drew her slightly shell-shocked love over to the couch, 
sitting her down before sitting beside her. &quot;I&#39;m sure that we&#39;ll 
figure it out,&quot; she murmured before gently pressing her lips to 
Yolie&#39;s.

        Gatomon gestured with her head, and Hawkmon followed her out 
worriedly. &quot;They wouldn&#39;t notice if a bomb went off right now,&quot; she 
noted with a smile.

        &quot;Are you sure we did the right thing, sending the two of them 
those dreams?&quot; Hawkmon asked Gatomon softly.

        &quot;Would they have done anything about their feelings for each 
other without them?&quot; Gatomon chuckled softly.

        A soft laugh. &quot;You may have a point,&quot; Kawkmon admitted. He 
gave Gatomon a sly glance, &quot;Should we come back later?&quot;

        &quot;Why not,&quot; Gatomon rubbed up against him and purred softly, 
&quot;this way I can spend some time alone with you.&quot;

Author&#39;s Note: My first Kari/Yolie fic, though I have slipped them 
into my other fics occasionally. Inspired by several sequences in the 
series where Kari and Yolie showed a great deal of caring for each 
other. One bit that sticks in my memory was when Kari was kidnapped by 
dark forces, and Yolie went after her. Kari calls upon her light to 
save them, and Yolie remarks that, &quot;It&#39;s beautiful ...like you, Kari.&quot; 
Despite the &#39;we&#39;ll pair everyone up as straight&#39; ending of Digimon 
series two, it had a lot of yuri and yaoi couples in it, too many to 
list here.</pre>
