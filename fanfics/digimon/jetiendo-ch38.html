<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../digimon/jetiendo-ch37.html">Back to Part 37</a><pre>Ash was the chapel; he looked at himself as if he thought he was ugly in 
the mirror he screamed at Misty,

&quot; I look like an absolute twat in this&quot; Ash snapped. &quot; May&#39;s gonna be 
all pretty and I&#39;m gonna look like a fucking retard.&quot;

&quot; Get a grip&quot; Misty moaned at him.

&quot;It&#39;s suppose to be May&#39;s best fucking day of her bloody life&quot; Ash 
screamed at her &quot; and she is gonna be a fucking run away bride, shit&quot;

&quot;Why ya being fucked up about it?&quot; Misty asked coldly

&quot; I know everything,&quot; Ash snapped at Misty. &quot; That lesbian affair, 
that&#39;s ok with me but having sex, while she&#39;s pregnant that is very 
stupid&quot;

Misty had turned red with anger and slapped him round the face; Ash was 
speechless

&quot;What was that for?&quot; Ash asked

&quot; I wanted to do that for five years, &quot; Misty breathed.

&quot;So you killed my flesh and blood,&quot; Ash snapped at her.

&quot;Ash&quot; Misty begged, &quot; I told you I had a bloody miscarriage&quot;

&quot; Fucking he, Stop lying to me&quot; Ash demanded verbally, &quot; Why can&#39;t ya 
just confess you had an abortion?&quot;

&quot; I&#39;M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH&quot; Misty roared at him

&quot; If you had any intention of keeping it&quot; Ash spat, &quot;you would have told 
somebody,&quot;

Misty holded a gun pointing directly at Ash&#39;s face

&quot;Okay&quot; Misty snapped at him &quot; this is the same gun I used to shoot you&quot;

&quot;Holy shit! You tried to kill me,&quot; Ash whispered roughly.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Misty hissed, &quot;now I want war you bastard&quot;

Ash picked up a gun that was right near the window.

&quot;YA WANNA WAR BICTH&quot; Ash shouted pointing a gun at Misty &quot;YA GOT ONE&quot;

Jade the new prime minister walked in as Misty and Ash where shooting at 
each other&#39;s throat out

&quot;STOP IT!&quot; Jade shouted &quot;both of you, we want you to be alive at the 
wedding

Misty got back to business looking at Ash, &quot;for a start ya&quot; Misty barked 
&quot;can tuck ya shirt in, sort your collar out, and why are you wearing 
trainers? TAKE THEM OFF!&quot;

&quot;Misty&quot; Jade snapped, &quot;I think you should go you&#39;re very hyper&quot;

&quot; I&#39;m not hyper&quot; Misty shouted &quot; he&#39;s stupid&quot; She was angry as she 
sorted out his clothes. Imagine your ex-girlfriend smartening you up, 
there&#39;s going to be trouble.

As Ash was smartened up by Misty he left the room as Jade was telling 
Misty off, he walked out of the chapel and sneaked to the girls 
dormitory he wanted to look at his bride see how pretty she was as all 
the girls praised her, Ash was about to walk in as he was dragged away.

&quot; Bad luck too see the bride before the ceremony Ash,&quot; Ash recognised 
his voice, Gary his brother-in-law. &quot;Come on&quot; Gary hissed &quot; I getting 
you to the church, Tasha wants to see you at once anyway.&quot; Gary took Ash 
to the church hall, the same grand hall, and the place where he was 
getting married. Tasha was waiting for him,

&quot; Tasha&quot; Ash shouted across the hall &quot; where&#39;s dad? Shouldn&#39;t he be here 
wit...&quot; then he noticed Tasha crying, the ice climbers Nana and Polo 
hugging her, there was a coffin besides Tasha,

&quot; Is dad in there?&quot; Ash asked

&quot; Yes&quot; Tasha replied

&quot; I thought we sorted this out Dad&quot; Ash shouted at the coffin.

&quot; He had a tumour&quot; Tasha replied, &quot; he died this morning, he prayed to 
God to live to see this day, God had other plans. He took him to a 
glorious place named heaven and look down on you, and he looks down on 
me Tasha Oak, still a Lilac the queen of Jetiendo and our job is to lead 
this war into a simple end&quot;

10 minutes later the wedding started, May looked like a princess, all 
Ash and May could do is helplessly stare at each other as May walked 
down the aisle, Father Luigi was ready for the service

&quot;People of Jetiendo&quot; Father Luigi started &quot; we are gathered here, to 
witness the union of this boy and this girl,&quot; Father Luigi looked at Ash 
&quot; do you Satoshi take Haruka&quot; as they used their Japanese names,

&quot; Take this girl to be your lawful wedded wife?&quot;

&quot;I do&quot; Ash replied

Father Luigi looked at May &quot;do you Haruka, take this boy to be your 
lawful wedded husband &quot;

&quot; I do&quot; May whispered as this was the day she always wanted to have

&quot; If for any reason,&quot; Father Luigi announced &quot; why these two should not 
be married, into the eyes off God, would they speak now or forever hold 
your peace...&quot;

May turned to Misty, seeing Misty&#39;s fake smile, as Kari watched Misty 
torturing herself, watching Ash getting married to someone else, silence 
stood across the whole room.

&quot;Well&quot; Father Luigi smiled with relief &quot; every one likes that bit over 
and done with,&quot; Luigi turned to Davis the best man &quot; has you got the 
ring?&quot;

&quot;Yeah!&quot; Davis replied digging in his pockets as he fell over,

&quot;DAVIS&quot; reared a voice. It was Jun,

&quot;Oh shit,&quot; Matt muttered, &quot; mother fucker&quot; as he ducked down

&quot;You forgot the rings&quot; Jun confronted Davis

&quot; You stole it on purpose,&quot; Davis shouted at Jun,

&quot;Lucky I think about my cousins&quot; Jun replied

&quot;Ok&quot; Father Luigi said to stop the quarrel, &quot; give Ash one of the rings&quot;

Jun gave Ash a ring. Ash placed it on the married finger, now nothing 
can take her away from him,

&quot; Now Ash repeats after me, with this ring&quot;

&quot;With this ring&quot;

&quot;I Satoshi Ketchum....&quot; &quot;I Satoshi Ketchum....&quot;

&quot;Take thee Haruka Day&quot; &quot;Take thee Haruka Maple&quot;

&quot;To be my lawful wedded wife&quot; &quot;to be my lawful wedded wife&quot;

&quot;With all my heart&quot; &quot;with all my heart&quot;

&quot;To love and to cherish&quot; &quot;to love and to cherish&quot;

&quot;To love and to hold&quot; &quot;to love and to hold&quot;

&quot;For better or for worse&quot; &quot;for better or for worse&quot;

&quot;For richer or for poorer&quot; &quot;for richer or for poorer&quot;

&quot;For sickness and in health&quot; &quot;for sickness and in health&quot;

&quot; Till death do us part&quot; &quot; till death do us part&quot;

Father Luigi smiled with trust &quot; Jun now give May the final ring&quot; Jun 
gave May the ring. May placed it on Ash&#39;s marriage finger &quot; okay May &quot; 
Father Luigi said &quot; your turn repeat after me, with this ring&quot;

&quot;With this ring&quot;

&quot;I Haruka Day....&quot; &quot;I Haruka Maple....&quot;

&quot;Take thee Satoshi Ketchum&quot; &quot;Take thee Satoshi Ketchum&quot;

&quot;For better or for worse&quot; &quot;for better or for worse&quot;

&quot;For richer or for poorer&quot; &quot;for richer or for poorer&quot;

&quot;For sickness and in health&quot; &quot;for sickness and in health&quot;

&quot; Till death do us part&quot; &quot; till death do us part&quot;

Father Luigi, smiled at them both

&quot;I now pronounce you man and wife&quot; Father Luigi smiled then he turned to 
Ash &quot;you may now kiss the bride&quot;

Angelica stood trail, cameras every corner people around her as she 
confessed her life

&quot; Angelica Lilac&quot; a barrister snapped at her &quot; do you plead guilty or 
not guilty&quot;

&quot;Yes I pled guilty, for 3 accounts of murder, manslaughter, sex 
additions, black mail, involvement in crime, provoking the cause of 
justice, wasting polices time I am guilty but hey that&#39;s life I&#39;m truly 
sorry for a bad life I had but it was worth it raising two sons, two 
marriages, twice widowed, prostitute, career money everything.&quot;

&quot;ANGELICA LILAC&quot; the judge roared, &quot; YOU CONFESS YOUR TERRIBLE CRIMES AS 
IF YOU ARE PROUD OF THEM. YOU KILLED A KILLER, AND THEN YOU KILLED 
OTHERS. TERRIFIED DELIA, SHAGGED ANYONE YOU COULD FIND, YOU BLACKMAILED 
PEOPLE, AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, I SEE HAVE NO HINT OF REMORSE, GO TO 
PRISON, I WISH NOT TO SEE YOU AGAIN!&quot;

The judge really spoke his mind of what he really thought of Angelica as 
she was taken to prison, never to return.

Seven days past, Tasha marched down the red carpet leading to the throne 
where her father sat. The choir sang loud Tasha was greeted with bows by 
the auidience and the school trip, never looked so smarter,

The fresh queen of Jetiendo She had tasted hell right from the day she 
was born, turned to God. Her mother died in childbirth, her stepmother 
ran away with Tasha&#39;s half-brother at 1. Raised by her Aunt Zelda now 
queen has earned the country Hyrule and the clergy of Jetiendo. All her 
uncles had died, Aunt Angelica in prison, Best friend Shyst Winstrate 
along with Tasha&#39;s cousin Garnet sliced in half by Shelito Paz. After 
her brutal childhood she was now Queen of Jetiendo, Father Luigi was 
going to crown Tasha due to the fact that of the useless genocides. 
Tasha&#39;s new goal was to stop the war to end all wars&#39;

&quot; Natasha Oak&quot; Father Luigi growled &quot; is you willing to take the oath 
and inherit your father&#39;s country&quot;

&quot; I am willing&quot; Tasha announced. Father Luigi put his hands in oil &quot; May 
I give you this holy oil&quot; Father Luigi said rubbing the oil on his 
finger making the sign of the cross onto Tasha&#39;s forehead &quot; and do you&quot; 
Father Luigi announced to the bishops on Tasha&#39;s left side &quot; the chosen 
bishops accept this girl to rule Jetiendo&quot; &quot;for the north I do&quot; &quot;for the 
east I do&quot; &quot;For the south I do &quot;For the west I do&quot;

Father Luigi passed Tasha an orb a stick and a crucifix to Tasha

&quot;And so it is my duty and my absolute pleasure&quot; Father Luigi said than 
he had the crown in his hands &quot;in the of the father, and of the son, and 
of the holy spirit, I crown you, Queen&quot; Tasha had done it. She felt the 
silver tiara with diamonds encrusted on them.

After the crowning pregnant Kari dashed to Misty, trying to sort things 
out,

&quot; Misty&quot; Kari whispered as Misty packed all her stuff from the Rosette 
hotel, &quot;look I&#39;m sorry for everything, Ash must really hate you now, TK 
and I made-up for the baby&#39;s benefit&quot;

&quot; Don&#39;t be&quot; Misty replied, &quot; because I&#39;m going to Japan, with you lot&quot;

Kari ran to her as she kissed Misty on the lips.&quot; Perfect &quot; Kari 
whispered. They both walked out the hotel happier and full of life. 
Misty got a text message from Ash,

Hi Misty, how r u? Im fine im sorry for not beliving you and I&#39;m sorry I 
woz not a good friend 2 u I hope u and I r still gud matez after my 
honeymoon, luv Ash

&quot; What&#39;s it say?&quot; Kari asked Misty

&quot;From Ash, he&#39;s sorry about everything&quot; Misty replied

&quot; I told ya it would work&quot; Kari replied

&quot;I&#39;m gonna reply&quot; Misty said

&quot;No Misty the train will be leaving any moment &quot; Kari smiled, Misty put 
her phone in her pocket and collected her bags as Kari holding her hand 
dashed out of the Rosette hotel to the train back to Japan

Tasha the new Queen of Jetiendo, along with her king prince Gary waved 
goodbye to the students at the train stop.

The students all left Jetiendo, the war wasn&#39;t completely over yet, they 
wouldn&#39;t see Kotono again, but and at least they could return to their 
Japanese culture that they haven&#39;t lived in for about half and a quarter 
of a year. At the end every one got his or her own way, no one will 
forget Jetiendo ever.

Ash and May were asleep, in a little cruise, the one that Rage brought 
them before he suddenly died they rested in a white double bed at the 
perfect day; the phone broke the perfect beautiful silence. Ash&#39;s phone 
went off.

May was awoken by the phone she picked up his phone and nudged Ash 
gently he got up slowly,

&quot; Misty&#39;s sent you a text&quot; May whisper to Ash. Ash read the message

Hi Ash, got the text, I 4give u, I shud b the 1 sayng sorry, I cant wait 
2 c u after the honeymoon luv misty

&quot;Misty&#39;s forgiven you&quot; May asked him

&quot;Yeah, she has&quot; Ash replied, &quot;thank god for that,&quot;

May lay beside Ash holding their hands, as they helplessly kissed 
eachother,

&quot;We&#39;ve been through eachother&#39;s situations, &quot; May panted &quot;it&#39;s only been 
about a year we&#39;ve known eachother, feels like forever, I cant give you 
up now, We&#39;ve both shed blood, sweat, tears together and apart, we&#39;ve 
never had one argument how weird, it feels so right though, This has to 
be forever&quot;</pre>
