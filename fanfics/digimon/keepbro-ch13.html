<h1>Keep Thy Brother Safe (part 13 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../digimon/keepbro-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>12 days left until Kari left Japan for good. She had peacefully left her 
home hoping never to return to Japan, no offence she had quite the 
perfect life there, until she went on that trip to Jetiendo she met a 
lot of new friends and became best of friends with May then she was 
slapped by TK and then met Misty. Kari and Misty walked holding hands a 
little bit braver than usual then as the rest of the class lined up to 
form they couldn&#39;t do it they hid near the sides of the lockers where 
they could see the class but the class could not see them. Ash and May 
was there lining up, that makes a big change, those two where constantly 
late and since the whole school found out about May&#39;s pregnancy it was 
all finally obvious that she was pregnant. 

&quot;ON THE SLABS GUYS&quot; Grinal announced. The class behaved better than they 
did before, 

&quot;Hey sir&quot; Ash shouted out &quot; May and I are on time&quot; 

&quot;Yes it&#39;s a miracle,&quot; Grinal moaned 

They both trembled as they both decided to line up 

&quot;Eau de fleur&quot; Davis shouted out in a disgusted way. 

&quot;Ginger&quot; Yolei shouted out 

&quot;Lesbians!&quot; the class shouted out. 

&quot;ALL SILENT&quot; barked Grinal as if he was a corporal in the royal navy 
army. 

Meanwhile Gary drove in his car, as fast as anything, infact so fast he 
only saw lines and blurry shapes where other cars and people where, he 
heard the police cars chasing him around as if he was a serial killer, 
his head felt a bit queasy as he pulled over, the cops lost him. Then he 
decided to drive sensibly as he did drive he spotted Jun walking down 
the street, he ignored her then he saw Ash and May walking out the 
hospital with a whole lot of press around them. 

Gary just drove off as Jun was following him. 

When Gary pulled over Jun instantly wrapped her arm round him, 

&quot;What the bloody hell do you want?&quot; Gary snapped. 

&quot;I found the perfect place &quot; Jun replied. 

&quot;Fucking hop in then&quot; Gary ordered as he opened the door of his car Jun 
hopped in. 

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean bloody literally,&quot; Gary hissed. 

Then as they drove Jun was explaining her place. 

&quot;Well, so it&#39;s got a nice beach and a quality tropical forest and what 
we&#39;re gonna do for the rest of our lives we&#39;ll find our own private 
spot, just you and me&quot; she was flirting dangerously as she took her tie 
of and took off 3 buttons of her blouse revealing her red bra popping 
out. 

&quot;Just you and me&quot; Jun smiled &quot;then what I&#39;m gonna do is I&#39;m gonna make 
you run 800 metres every day then I&#39;m gonna lick your sweat and I&#39;m 
gonna start with your forehead and I&#39;m gonna lick all the way to your 
testy...&quot; 

Gary pulled over. &quot; Oh for fucks sake tell me where the fucking hell 
we&#39;re going&quot; 

Jun started to sit on. Gary&#39;s lap and kissed him on the cheek, as she 
was masturbating him, 

&quot; I...B...I...Z...A Ibiza!&quot; Jun giggled. 

&quot;Remove your fingers of my fucking cock please&quot; Gary rudely asked 

Jun took her hand away &quot; I thought boys liked masturbation&quot; she sexily 
laughed 

&quot;I don&#39;t&quot; Gary hissed 

&quot;Seriously!&quot; Jun laughed 

&quot;Yes&quot; then Gary smelt some cheap perfume he thought it smelt horrible, &quot; 
Fuck what&#39;s that smell&quot; 

&quot; This perfume is my love potion&quot; Jun announced as if she was the 
sexiest thing ever to walk the planet. 

&quot;Get away from me&quot; Gary replied 

&quot;YOU DO NOT THINK I&#39;M SEXY!&quot; Jun asked 

&quot;No I don&#39;t&quot; Gary replied &quot; now you can get out of my car, we&#39;ve had 
quite enough of this shit today&quot;
