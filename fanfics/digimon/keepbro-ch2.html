<a href="../digimon/keepbro-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;Every one on the slabs guys&quot; Mr Grinal announced his usual deep 
Australian accent 

&quot;We&#39;re all on the slabs,&quot; Himeno shouted out 

Mr Grinal&#39;s face screwed 

&quot;Smile Jesus loves you&quot; Michelle shouted out in a &#39;rude fashion&#39; 

&quot;Guys don&#39;t shout out in that tone,&quot; Grinal complained.&nbsp;&quot;30 seconds to 
line up&quot; 

As the class entered in half the class fell over 

&quot;Every one out guys&quot; Grinal shouted out 

The class complained as they left the classroom 

&quot;We&#39;re all on the slabs guys, we&#39;re all silent&quot; 

&quot;All silent&quot; Davis shouted impersonating Mr Grinal 

&quot;Please don&#39;t impersonate my voice Davis&quot; complained Mr Grinal, 

&quot;Why did you send us out?&quot; asked Willis. 

Grinal ignored him 

&quot;OK year nine quiet please&quot; Grinal ordered. 10 seconds delay. &quot;WE DO NOT 
ENTER THE CLASSROOM IN THAT RUDE FASHION.&quot; Grinal roared. &quot;Do it 
properly this time guys. 

&quot;Ok guys,&quot; Mr Grinal roared in his usual deep Australian accent &quot;all 
behind our chairs, we&#39;re all silent,&quot; 

&quot;All silent&quot; Davis shouted out. 

&quot;Please don&#39;t impersonate my voice Davis&quot; Grinal snarled at him 

&quot;Smile&quot; Ritchie shouted at Mr Grinal &quot;Jesus loves you&quot; 

&quot;Change your tone Richie, &#39;K year nine...&quot; 

&quot; It&#39;s fifth grade for god&#39;s sake,&quot; Ken pointed out. 

&quot;Ken, go outside&quot; Grinal snapped &quot;and pray to the lord on the slabs&quot; 

&quot; You must be joking,&quot; Ken snapped back &quot; pray to the lord on the slabs. 
I&#39;m a Buddhist not a Christian FOR GOD&#39;S SAKE&quot; Ken slammed the door so 
hard a chip came on the window. 

&quot;We do not say the lord&#39;s name in vein guys.&quot; Grinal announced. The 
class finally gave Grinal their full attention. &quot;Take a seat guys&quot; 
Grinal said, the class started talking as they began to sat down &quot;stand 
up guys, you can remain standing until I call the register. &quot; Grinal 
paid his attention to Ash and May whom where late. 

&quot;My cousin and his wife&quot; Davis shouted out so the class would laugh. 

&quot;Do not call out in that rude manner,&quot; Grinal complained. He screwed his 
face, &quot;Where&#39;s TK and Kari?&quot; he asked suspiciously 

&quot;They&#39;re looking after their baby&quot; Yolei shouted out. 

&quot;Yolei, you&#39;ll be coming back at 1:25&quot; Grinal snapped then he pointed at 
the empty seats &quot; Ash and May in the mean time you stand where TK and 
Kari was sitting.&quot; Then Mr Grinal looked around the classroom &quot;we&#39;ve 
seemed to have rearranged ourselves guys&quot; 

Mawata had her head down; she looked very tired. 

&quot;Mawata change the tone of your face&quot; Mr complained the class laughed at 
the teacher. &quot;This is not a laughing matter, guys&quot; 

&quot;Are you going to call out the register now?&quot; Misty asked 

Mr Grinal glared at Yolei &quot;Yolei, you do not speak to me in that tone&quot; 

&quot;I never asked you it was that ginger lesbian,&quot; Yolei shouted back 

&quot;Yolei you have an after school and Saturday detention&quot; 

&quot; You can&#39;t give detentions on a Saturday&quot; Ash called out, Davis pointed 
out his &#39;tone&#39; to Mr Grinal 

&quot;Sir&quot; Davis called out pointing at his cousin and his girlfriend 
directly&quot; you should those two an after school for being late, also give 
my cousin another after school for speaking to you in a rude fashion&quot; 

&quot;Davis you&#39;ll be coming back at 1:25&quot; Grinal announced. Ash turned 
around and smirked at Davis 

&quot;ASH, TURN AROUND AND FACE THE FRONT&quot; Grinal roared 

&quot;Yes sir&quot; Ash said timidly 

&quot; So immature isn&#39;t he sir?&quot; confronted Misty. Mr Grinal went outside to 
complain at ken. May tried to stand up on the table, keeping her balance 
as she picked up the register and called it out. 

&quot;Hello every one&quot; May shouted out &quot;I&#39;m doing the register because Grinal 
can&#39;t be bothered&quot; 

Davis came over to help with the register as he sat on the table. 

&quot;Voulez vous coucher avec moi ce soir?&quot; Ash asked May 

&quot;Oui!&quot; May replied 

&quot;Voila&quot; Davis said bitterly 

Then Mr Grinal returned to the classroom as Ken angrily entered the 
room. The first thing grinal saw was May standing on the table 

&quot;May, change the manner of your feet.&quot; Said Grinal. May fell over and 
landed on the floor, sheer laughter filled the classroom. Mr Grinal 
picked up the register as May returned to her seat 

&quot;&#39;K year nine quiet please,&quot; he asked politely then he turned furious &quot; 
that was not a laughing matter guys! This unacceptable behavior guys.&quot; 
Then he turned around and spotted Ash and May holding hands &quot;Ash and May 
will a detention at lunch for their sexual behaviour&quot;&nbsp;

&quot;That is stupid&quot; Misty shouted out 

&quot;&nbsp;Misty you&#39;ll be coming back at 1.25!&quot; Grinal snapped pointing at Misty 

&quot;Am I bovad?&quot; Misty shouted out. 

&quot;Misty,&quot; Grinal snapped, &quot; change, your tone&quot; 

Misty thought he said change your top 

&quot;I BEG YOUR PARDON?&quot; Misty snapped &quot;WHAT THE FUCKING HELL IS WRONG WITH 
MY TOP YOU RETARD!&quot; 

&quot;I said change your tone&quot; Grinal snapped. 

&quot;No you didn&#39;t you said change your top&quot; 

&quot;Do not speak to me in that rude fashion, outside&quot; Grinal ordered. 

&quot;Mr Grinal&quot; Misty snapped, &quot; you should look up in the dictionary, 
fashion is about clothes&quot; 

&quot; Do not speak to me about clothes. &quot; Grinal snapped. Misty slammed the 
door 

&quot;SILLY MAN!&quot; Misty screamed as she was outside.
