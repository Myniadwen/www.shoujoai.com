<h1>Eine Kleine Nachtmuzik</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/gabriel.html">Gabriel</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The dead of night. Even in the suburbs the darkness reached in and 
ruled, conquering the areas between streetlights, behind walls, 
covering houses in blackness. But no one ever notices such things, 
because most people are asleep and dreaming. But atop one darkened 
roof a lone figure sat, head down and eyes closed in thought. Her tail 
twitched softly, growing impatient from inaction. The vulpine figure 
lifted her muzzle slowly to regard the darkness of the night, kept 
barely at bay by the action of streetlights, and then stared upwards 
at the stars. &quot;Such a beautiful night...&quot; she mused in a silky, 
seductive voice. &quot;It&#39;s a shame my Heartbreaker can&#39;t see this.&quot; With a 
deft leap the fox Digimon vanished into thin air, only to reappear 
before a sliding door inside the house. Softly, she slid the door 
open, letting some of the hazy illumination spill into the room, 
directly onto the sleeping mat laid out upon the floor.

On that mat lay a young girl, facing away from the door. Her red hair 
lay limply upon the pillow beneath her head, the rest of her body 
hidden by a light blanket. From the way the blanket draped over her it 
was easy to tell she was a very slight girl, trim with long and 
graceful limbs. &quot;She&#39;s so peaceful when she sleeps. My little 
Heartbreaker.&quot; Renamon smiled lightly as she thought of her feelings 
for Rika, and the reciprocation of those feelings that emerged once 
Rika realized it was love that gave strength. Renamon quietly made her 
way to the small mat, dropping down once she was there, leaning in 
close to Rika&#39;s neck. Her nose lightly made contact with the warmth of 
the girl&#39;s skin, making her wiggle a bit and open one eye.

&quot;Re... na... mon?&quot;

&quot;Hello Heartbreaker. Sorry I woke you, but I just couldn&#39;t help it.&quot; 
The blanket rustled softly as Renamon lifted it and slowly slid in 
with Rika, pressing her silky, warm fur against the human girl&#39;s bare 
skin.

Rika pressed back against Renamon without even thinking about it, but 
immediately closed her eyes after snuggling into the warmth of the 
Digimon. &quot;Sorry Renamon, but I can&#39;t tonight. I&#39;m just too tired...&quot;

&quot;Perish the thought, Heartbreaker. It was just such a lovely night 
out; I got lonely without you there to admire it with me.&quot; Renamon&#39;s 
arm slowly came around to hug Rika, more warm fur brushing over her 
bare skin.

&quot;Mmm, Renamon. You&#39;re so warm, and silky-soft.&quot; Rika snuggled herself 
into Renamon&#39;s softness even more, one hand lightly reaching down to 
stroke the full and fluffy tail that was twirling about her legs.

Renamon softly rested her muzzle on Rika&#39;s neck, rubbing her soft 
cheek fur against the girl&#39;s cheek. &quot;And you&#39;re so beautiful, 
Heartbreaker.&quot;

Rika softly laughed as her fingers twined into the fur of Renamon&#39;s 
tail. &quot;That&#39;s such a funny pet name...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s also a reverse curse. Maybe if I keep saying it you&#39;ll never 
really break my heart.&quot;

Rika curled her body a bit, to really press herself against Renamon&#39;s 
front, her head shaking in disagreement, and to rub her cheek against 
Renamon&#39;s. &quot;Never. No matter what, I would never do such a thing to 
you. We&#39;re partners, in everything. To the end.&quot; One of Rika&#39;s hands 
started moving, slowly dragging through the silky fur of Renamon&#39;s 
tail to where it attached to her body. Once there her fingers started 
to softly massage the area of connection, one of Renamon&#39;s sensitive 
spots. While doing that, Rika slowly started to turn around, to press 
her bare front to her lover.

&quot;H-Heartbreaker! What are you doing?&quot; Renamon&#39;s body slowly writhed 
against the mat beneath her, and against Rika as her tail base was 
massaged. &quot;I thought you said you were tired.&quot;

Rika smiled before her lips made contact with Renamon&#39;s, her free hand 
going around Renamon&#39;s back to hold her in a tight hug. The kiss was 
deep and passionate, Renamon getting over the initial shock to hold 
Rika tight while kissing her as deeply and warmly. After a long, 
breathless moment they pulled apart, both panting deeply and staring 
right into each other&#39;s blue eyes. Rika wore an impish smile, while 
Renamon still looked bewildered. &quot;What am I doing? My dear, I am 
setting your mind at ease. Sleep can wait. I want to see this 
beautiful night with my beautiful partner.&quot; While Renamon remained on 
the mat, Rika slowly rose and wrapped herself in the blanket. By the 
time Rika started walking towards the door, Renamon had finally 
recovered her senses and was beside her, with an arm around her waist.

Outside the two of them walked slowly, leaning against each other, 
Rika barely opening her eyes, trusting Renamon to keep her safe. They 
arrived at the edge of the koi pond, the soft wind making the 
reflection of the moon waver and ripple. Rika opened the blanket and 
embraced Renamon, the Digimon pressing against Rika&#39;s side before 
closing the blanket around the two of them. Slowly, and in perfect 
unison, they sat down at the edge of the pond, still leaning against 
each other, but now also starting to look upwards to the moon and 
stars. Renamon softly rested her head atop Rika&#39;s, her arm around Rika 
holding her tighter, as though trying to ensure the girl wouldn&#39;t 
leave her.

&quot;You have nothing to fear.&quot; Rika&#39;s arm reached around Renamon and 
hugged her back tightly. &quot;It&#39;s too beautiful to leave.&quot;

&quot;It is a nice night, isn&#39;t it? The moon and stars are so bright...&quot;

&quot;Who said anything about the night?&quot; Rika smiled and rubbed her cheek 
against Renamon&#39;s neck. &quot;It&#39;s so pretty out here. Just you and the 
night. It seems sad...&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that, Heartbreaker?&quot;

&quot;That no one can know how I feel about you. I have to constantly hide 
it. Even from those other two Digi-losers. It hurts me deeply when I 
realize that I&#39;ve found the most perfect person in the entire world to 
spend my life with and I can&#39;t say a thing about it. No one is allowed 
to know that the one thing that has made my life worthwhile is a fox 
with strange powers. I&#39;m all alone with this...&quot; Rika hung her head 
down, and hugged herself tighter again Renamon.

&quot;How fast you forget, Heartbreaker, that you&#39;re never alone. I&#39;m 
always at your side, no matter what. Even if you can&#39;t see me, I&#39;m 
there.&quot; Renamon nosed softly at the top of Rika&#39;s head, breathing into 
her hair, taking in the girl&#39;s scent.

Rika didn&#39;t speak. She merely let her hand drift down to the base of 
Renamon&#39;s tail, to softly massage the area again. The other hand came 
around to slowly stroke down Renamon&#39;s belly, gently stroking downward 
until it reached the area between her thighs. Rika pressed her palm 
lightly against Renamon&#39;s vulva, slowly rubbing it and smearing her 
palm with Renamon&#39;s slight moisture. Renamon stiffened a little at the 
initial contact, as she always did, but eventually started to rest 
herself more and more against Rika. Two of Rika&#39;s fingers gently 
started to rub against the folds of Renamon&#39;s sex, spreading them 
apart like petals on a flower. Rika started licking down Renamon&#39;s 
front, keeping the fox&#39;s lips spread as an eventual target for her 
licks.

Rika at last reached the space she had been going for, her small, 
delicate tongue gently sliding up from the perineum to Renamon&#39;s 
hooded clit. Renamon gasped deeply at the single lick, letting herself 
lean back more and more until she was resting on her palms and her 
feet, rear off the ground and up for Rika&#39;s licking. &quot;Ahh ahh... Just 
a little higher...&quot; Renamon adjusted her position slightly, so that 
Rika&#39;s soft licking now gently pushed up the hood of her clit and 
rubbed a little bit of her tongue against the exposed nub. Renamon 
then began to pant and moan deeply, her body shivering as the 
now-familiar feelings began to course through her body once again. It 
still felt like the first time each time Rika touched her like this, a 
new and exciting experience for her to savor.

As Rika&#39;s licking continued, the two fingers that had been holding 
Renamon spread now worked in a totally different way. One of them slid 
along Renamon&#39;s outer lips, while the other gently caressed the inner 
lips, slowly working it&#39;s way deeper, each lap of her tongue prompting 
the finger to slide more into Renamon&#39;s sex. Renamon&#39;s pants grew more 
ragged and heated, her head thrown back and her mouth open wide as she 
tried not to vocalize too loudly, lest she wake Rika&#39;s mother or 
grandmother. At last she could no longer hold it in, and started to 
groan and cry in a high-pitched whine that she tried to cover with one 
hand, her hips twitching up and down, moving on Rika&#39;s finger and 
against her tongue. Once her moment of ecstasy had passed she limply 
rested on her hands and feet, head hanging back and body ready to sag 
to the ground. Rika looked up from between Renamon&#39;s thighs, slowly 
extracting her finger and licking it clean before gently helping 
Renamon down to the ground to relax.

&quot;Th-thank you, Heartbreaker... That was lovely.&quot;

&quot;Think nothing of it, my love. It was my pleasure.&quot;

A wily smirk crossed Renamon&#39;s face and she slowly started to rise, 
slowly coming towards Rika. &quot;You haven&#39;t had your pleasure yet. But 
you will. It&#39;s only fair...&quot; Before Rika could move, Renamon had her 
cold nose rubbing against the girl&#39;s thigh, trailing up to her slit 
immediately. Rika gasped softly, laying sprawled out on the slightly 
cool stone beside the pond, the fingertips of one hand lightly dipping 
into the water. Renamon knew Rika&#39;s preferences well at that point, so 
she simply rubbed her cool nose around, nudging at the girl&#39;s button 
while merely breathing cool air over her sex.

Rika slowly writhed in the moonlight, naked limbs slowly stretching 
and bending again, both feet softly planting themselves on Renamon&#39;s 
shoulders, her silky thighs closed slightly around Renamon&#39;s head. 
&quot;Easy, Heartbreaker. We haven&#39;t gotten to your favorite part yet...&quot; 
Renamon closed her eyes slowly, now relying on her tongue&#39;s sense of 
touch to continue with her pleasuring of Rika. Her cool nose remained 
on Rika&#39;s sensitive nubbin, blowing warm air over it slowly, while her 
mouth was opened slightly, allowing her deft, agile tongue to snake 
out and lap over the girl&#39;s young slit. She twisted her tongue 
sideways, rubbing it between Rika&#39;s lips slowly, accompanying it with 
quick pants through her nose.

With all the attention to her most intimate regions, from someone who 
knew how to work her, Rika couldn&#39;t help but softly moan and sigh in 
delight. Renamon then did what Rika had been anticipating; she darted 
her tongue quickly inside Rika&#39;s sex, the agile muscle licking around 
within to stimulate her love greatly. Rika covered her mouth with both 
hands to stifle her cries like Renamon had done, a few squeaks of 
pleasure still managing to escape. Her climax was much quicker and 
less expected, with a lot of twitching, as she was flooded with 
pleasure. &quot;Just like always. What a marvel she is...&quot; Rika observed, 
while Renamon withdrew her tongue and cleaned up the area well. As 
Renamon&#39;s tongue slowly ceased licking, Rika&#39;s eyes grew heavier and 
heavier, until they finally closed, and left her asleep.

&quot;My lovely Heartbreaker...&quot; Renamon quietly said, as she wrapped Rika 
in the blanket and returned her to her room. She gave her human love a 
soft kiss on the cheek and stepped away with a smile. &quot;Always and 
forever. Eternally yours...&quot; Then she simply vanished into nothing. 
Forever hiding, always there for her one true love.

I know, I know. The lemon part wasn&#39;t as good as it should have been. 
I tried to go for tasteful and sweet. I think I captured it with a 
proper amount of fluffiness. Thanks for reading. Please do comment :)
