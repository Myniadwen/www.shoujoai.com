<pre>As soon as she came home from school, Rika Nonaka kicked off her shoes 
at the door and ran to her room. She found herself alone, but knew 
that Renamon was probably not far away. She sat down on the bed and 
sighed, then fell back on the bed, slightly exhausted. 

She was startled a few moments later when, while staring at the 
ceiling, Renamon entered her field of vision and looked down at her 
with her deep blue eyes. 

&quot;You frightened me,&quot; Rika said. &quot;Don&#39;t sneak up on me like that.&quot; 

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Renamon said, and sat down on the bed next to Rika. 

&quot;What is it?&quot; Rika asked without getting up. &quot;There are no Digimon to 
fight.&quot; 

&quot;I know,&quot; Renamon said, looking over at and down on Rika. &quot;I didn&#39;t 
say anything about fighting.&quot; 

&quot;What is it, then?&quot; Rika asked. 

Renamon didn&#39;t say anything, but instead leaned over Rika and took 
hold of her wrists, holding them down onto the bed. 

&quot;Renamon!&quot; Rika shouted, struggling futilely to escape. &quot;What are you 
doing?!&quot; 

Renamon leaned down closer to Rika&#39;s face, and Rika had some idea what 
was on her mind. 

&quot;You know,&quot; Renamon said. 

&quot;What... what are you talking about?!&quot; Rika stammered, still trying to 
escape. &quot;Let me go!&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve never been curious,&quot; Renamon said. &quot;Haven&#39;t you 
thought about it? What it might be like?&quot; 

It was true. Rika had never been with anyone, but she wasn&#39;t stupid. 
She knew all about sex. She had touched herself before, in the 
bathtub, or after she went to bed, and she knew how good it felt. 
While in class, she sometimes found herself staring at a cute boy or 
girl, and wondering what it would be like to do that with another 
person. And she had even looked at Renamon and wondered if Digimon 
could do it, too, and wondered what it might be like. Looking up at 
Renamon, she couldn&#39;t deny it, and stopped struggling. 

&quot;Good girl,&quot; Renamon said, leaning down over Rika&#39;s face. Slowly she 
pressed her lips against Rika&#39;s and kissed the young girl. Rika closed 
her eyes as she felt Renamon&#39;s warm lips pressed against her. 

Renamon drew back and looked at the girl lying underneath her. She 
somewhat reluctantly released Rika&#39;s hands, hoping the girl wouldn&#39;t 
try to escape her. Unbeknownst to Renamon, that was the last thing 
Rika wanted. 

Her hands now free, Rika reached up and rubbed Renamon&#39;s chest, 
feeling the soft fur with her hands. Renamon smiled as she reached 
down and unbuttoned the shirt of Rika&#39;s school uniform. When she was 
finished, Rika stretched out her arms and slid out of the shirt. 
Renamon leaned down and kissed Rika&#39;s bare chest. Rika leaned back and 
closed her eyes, enjoying the feel of Renamon&#39;s soft warm lips against 
her naked skin, Renamon&#39;s fur tickling her just a bit. She stroked 
Renamon&#39;s head with her hands as Renamon showered her with kisses. 

Renamon raised herself up and slid her hands down Rika&#39;s skirt. Rika 
raised her hips and with one hand Renamon slid the skirt down Rika&#39;s 
legs and tossed it aside carelessly. She looked at Rika and smiled, 
the bent down and kissed Rika&#39;s stomach. Slowly she ran her tongue 
across Rika&#39;s soft skin until she came to Rika&#39;s panties. With both 
hands she grabbed them by the waistband and pulled them down. Again, 
Rika raised her hips to aid in their removal. Renamon could feel that 
they were damp, and she could smell Rika&#39;s scent on them. 

She laid them aside and looked at the naked girl before her. Rika 
looked up at Renamon and smiled softly. Renamon again bent down over 
Rika and kissed her navel, then ran her tongue down farther. With her 
hands, she softly parted Rika&#39;s legs. 

Renamon kissed the soft skin between Rika&#39;s legs. Rika moaned a bit, 
and Renamon found Rika&#39;s clitoris and licked the tiny nub. Rika moaned 
in pleasure. Renamon could taste the moisture between Rika&#39;s legs, a 
signal that her attempts to arouse Rika were effective. She inserted 
her tongue into Rika and could again taste Rika&#39;s fluids. 

Rika closed her eyes and moaned softly. She rubbed her hands over 
Renamon&#39;s head. Renamon raised up and licked the remaining fluid off 
of her lips. Slowly she slid her rather large hand up Rika&#39;s leg and 
inserted a finger into Rika. Rika moaned a bit louder this time. As 
she continued to rub Rika with her finger, she leaned over Rika. 

&quot;Does that feel good, Rika?&quot; Renamon asked. She already knew the 
answer, but she wanted to hear it anyway. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; Rika said in-between moans. 

&quot;Do you want me to stop?&quot; Renamon asked. 

&quot;No, don&#39;t stop,&quot; Rika said. &quot;Please don&#39;t stop.&quot; 

Renamon didn&#39;t stop. She listened to Rika panting, moaning, and she 
sped up the movements of her finger. Rika was lying back on the bed, 
with her eyes closed, totally oblivious to the world around her. All 
her being was concentrated on Renamon and the pleasure Renamon was 
giving her. 

&quot;Ahhhhh,&quot; Rika moaned softly. Renamon could sense that she was about 
to have an orgasm, and rubbed harder and faster with her finger. &quot;Oh, 
yes, yes!&quot; Rika moaned, which someone would have undoubtedly heard if 
her house wasn&#39;t so big. As she let out one final moan, Rika&#39;s body 
stiffened, and then she fell back onto the bed, exhausted, her eyes 
closed. Renamon laid down beside her. 

&quot;Did you enjoy that?&quot; Renamon asked, looking into Rika&#39;s eyes. Rika 
smiled. 

&quot;Of course,&quot; she said, rubbing her hand down Renamon&#39;s chest, feeling 
the soft fur against her hand. &quot;But I don&#39;t think we&#39;re done yet.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, really?&quot; Renamon asked, wondering what Rika had in mind. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; Rika said, sliding her hand down Renamon&#39;s chest and stomach 
and between her legs. Renamon laid back on the bed and parted her 
legs, and Rika bent down over top of her. She kissed Renamon on the 
lips as he hand travelled between Renamon&#39;s legs. 

With a bit of exploration, she found what she sought. Beneath the fur, 
Rika could feel the soft folds of skin, and the aperture they 
surrounded. He inexperienced and unskilled hand rubbed around the 
opening, hoping to give Renamon the same pleasure that she had been 
given. Laying down on top of Renamon, she slid one finger of her tiny 
hand in, and then another. Renamon was wet, as wet as she herself had 
been earlier. With her fingers, she rubbed inside Renamon, not really 
sure of what she was doing, but hoping it was right. 

Renamon moaned, responding to Rika&#39;s stimulation. She put her arms 
around Rika as Rika kissed her again, while still rubbing Renamon. 
Renamon moaned again and moved her hips against Rika&#39;s fingers. Rika 
slid a third finger and rubbed the Digimon deep inside. 

&quot;Oh,&quot; Renamon moaned. 

&quot;Does that feel good?&quot; Rika asked, repeating what Renamon had asked 
earlier. Of course she knew the answer as well, but she wanted to hear 
Renamon say it, to see how it felt. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; Renamon said, pushing her hips down against the tiny hand which 
rubbed inside her, trying to bring her pleasure. 

&quot;You don&#39;t want me to stop, do you?&quot; Rika asked again, enjoying this 
little game. She always liked being in a dominant position, and she 
was enjoying this very much. 

&quot;No, don&#39;t stop,&quot; Renamon said, moaning and rubbing against Rika&#39;s 
small, soft hands. 

Rika considered making Renamon beg her, but decided against it. &quot;I 
won&#39;t stop,&quot; Rika said simply. She began rubbing Renamon more quickly 
than before. Renamon moved her hips against Rika&#39;s hand, moaning. 

&quot;Yes, Rika,&quot; Renamon moaned. &quot;That&#39;s it. That feels wonderful! Don&#39;t 
stop!&quot; She pulled Rika against her body, enjoying the heat of Rika&#39;s 
naked body pressed against her own. Rika continued to rub inside of 
Renamon. 

&quot;Oh, yes, Rika!&quot; Renamon cried, still thrusting her hips against 
Rika&#39;s hand. &quot;Yes! Yes! Ahhhhhhhhhh...&quot; Renamon cried out, and her 
body reflexively tightened. Rika could feel and hear her heart beating 
rapidly. Finally Renamon fell back on the bed, and relaxed. Rika 
removed her fingers from Renamon. She looked at the liquid which 
covered them, curious. She smelled her fingers, and finding the 
fragrance appealing, she licked one of her fingers off, then the 
other, and finally the third. The taste was interesting, something she 
had never experienced, and unlike anything she had ever tasted before. 

She laid down on Renamon and put her head against the Digimon&#39;s chest. 
Renamon still had her arms around Rika. She laid there, silently. 
Neither of them said anything for what seemed almost like an eternity. 
Neither wanted to end the peaceful, placid air with words. The silence 
was destroyed by a beeping noise, coming from Rika&#39;s Digivice, which 
was laying on the table nearby. 

Rika rose reluctantly and walked over to it. Renamon sat up on the 
bed. They both knew what it was. After looking at a moment, Rika took 
her usual clothes out of the dresser and began getting dressed. 

&quot;Is it another Digimon?&quot; Renamon asked. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; Rika replied. 

&quot;Let&#39;s go, then,&quot; Renamon said. 

In a moment Rika had her clothes on and her Digivice and cards with 
her, and they were out the door, heading for the next challenge in a 
seemingly never-ending series of battles.
