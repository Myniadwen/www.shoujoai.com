------------------------------------------------------------

I rocked my head back and fourth slightly, allowing it to flow to the 
music as I laid on my bed. This was my only escape from the tourcher. 
The pain that she inflicted upon me. Why did she have to be so 
wonderful and perfect in every way? Why did she have to be so 
beautiful, inside and out? Why did I have to be in love with her?

I suddenly heard the quick, sharp sound of the doorbell. I took off 
the head phones, groggily got off my bed, and scrambled to the door. 
When I opened it, I nearly fainted.

There she was. Standing there. Smiling at me. My angel. The sun 
outlined her features, making her seem to glow. She was wearing her 
school uniform, hair was plain. She looked like a goddess. The true 
goddess that she really was. Nothing was more perfect. Nothing.

&quot;Hello Hikari.&quot; Her angelic voice nearly sent me over the edge. She 
was so calm and cool. So wonderful in every way. 

&quot;H-hello Sora.&quot; I stuttered.

&quot;Is Taichi here? We&#146;re studying.&quot; I frowned. Taichi. My obstacle. It 
was obvious he liked her too. The way her looked at her, invited her 
over for every reason his small brain could think of, had a picture of 
her hanging in his room, everything! Yes, everything. And do you know 
what? I was scared that she was falling for him too.

&quot;Taichi? Yes. He&#146;s in his room.&quot; I told her, pointing upstairs.

&#145;Thank you Hikari.&quot; She told me, giving me a heart warming smile and 
then rushing off to his room. I stood there, paralyzed. Paralyzed with 
fear and dread. It was so obvious now. Sora wasn&#146;t a lesbian. She was 
straight. She loved Taichi. She loved him. Not me. She would never 
love me. I&#146;m just his younger, insignificant sister. I could never 
compare it him. Never. I could never bask in the warmth of her smile, 
her touch, her kisses, her embrace. I was destined to watch from the 
side lines, while they shared their first kiss, got married, had their 
first child. And I was supposed to act happy for them. Like I wasn&#146;t 
jealous. Like I didn&#146;t want the only person in the world that mattered 
to me.

Yet, didn&#146;t I deserve it? Didn&#146;t I deserve Sora? I had grades. I got 
them for my parents. I had popularity. That was for my brother, so he 
wouldn&#146;t be teased about his stupid sister. I kept at war with Takeru. 
For my brother too. He still didn&#146;t like Yamato, and so I was keeping 
war with the Ishidas. I had guys hanging all over me. That was so I 
could convince them to go out with my friends. See, it may sound 
stupid, but it actually does work if I give them a pretty smile and 
say pretty please. But that&#146;s not the point. Everything I had ever 
done was for other people. I wanted something for me. Or someone. Yet, 
I couldn&#146;t. She was so far out of reach. And in my brothers.

Oh, the irony. I&#146;m supposed to fall in love with Takeru, get married 
to him, and live happily ever after, right? Sorry, not in my fairy 
tale. Mine was so much different. But it was mine. Mine. And yet, it 
would still be only a fairy tale. It would never be mine. Yet, it 
would be my brothers. &#145;His sister is in love with his girlfriend.&#146; 
Sounds stupid. And it is. 

Oh Sora Takenouchi! Why can&#146;t you see?! I love you! I&#146;ve loved you 
ever since the entire Digiworld thing! Every time I see you my heart 
skips a beat. Do you know how physically painful to have you heart 
stop beating is?! I do! But it&#146;d for you! I&#146;d give anything in the 
world for your happiness! Even if it meant sacrificing my own. Please, 
just realize we were meant to be. I&#146;m begging you.

But begging won&#146;t do, will it? It depends what&#146;s in her heart. Me or 
Taichi. Oh god! She&#146;ll never be mine! Never! 

With that, I slid down the wall, breaking into tears of mental pain.

&#145;Never.&#146;
