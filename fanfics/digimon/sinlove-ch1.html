<h1>The Sincerity of Love</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kakaroto.html">Kakaroto</a><br> </h2>
<pre>This one goes out to my greatest inspiration for non-Lemon romances, 
Kenji Kotaro, and the love of my life, Taiora Girl. It takes place 
about two years after the defeat of MaruVandemon. And yes, I know this 
completely ignores a big part of the ending of Digimon 02, but hey, 
who cares as long as it&#39;s good?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Children behave...
That&#39;s what they say when we&#39;re together.
And watch how you play.
They don&#39;t understand and so we&#39;re.....

Miyako lay on her bead, crying into her pillow. She couldn&#39;t believe 
that she saw Daisuke with that cheerleader. He&#39;d already been going 
out with Miyako for almost a year, and had swore he loved her and 
would never let another woman into his life as long as they were 
together.

Runnin&#39; just as fast as we can,
Holdin&#39; onto one another&#39;s hand.
Tryin&#39; to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say.....

&#39;And yet,&#39; she thought, &#39;there he was, kissing that bimbo right in 
front of me. Well, I showed him what I thought of THAT! With any luck, 
that kick will prevent him and that floose of his from ever having 
children.&#39; Sighing, she wiped the remaining tears from her face and 
picked up the telephone by her bed. &#39;At least there&#39;s ONE person 
who&#39;ll understand this. I&#39;m sure glad her family moved back to Odaiba 
last year.&#39;

***********************************************************************
I think we&#39;re alone now...
There doesn&#39;t seem to be anyone around.
I think we&#39;re alone now...
The beating of our hearts is the only sound.

Mimi had been getting ready for a date with Joe when the phone rang. 
Picking it up, she immediately recognized Miyako&#39;s voice on the other 
end. &quot;Hey, Miyako. How&#39;re things with &#39;Dai-Chan&#39;?&quot; Mimi asked, 
playfully using Miyako&#39;s pet name for Daisuke.

&quot;If I ever hear anyone call him that again, I&#39;ll rip their spine out.&quot; 
she replied coldly.

This worried Mimi. In all the years she had known Miyako, she had 
never heard the girl speak of one of her friends in such a manner. 
&quot;Miyako, what&#39;s wrong? Did he do something to you?&quot; Mimi listened as 
her friend recounted what had taken place in the park earlier that 
day. &quot;Oh, you poor thing. I know what you&#39;re going through. I had to 
sit back and watch as Sora won Matt&#39;s heart when I had sought it for 
all those years. I&#39;d love to come over there and talk, but I&#39;m having 
dinner with Joe in about a half hour.&quot; Mimi thought for a minute 
before saying, &quot;Why don&#39;t you call Jun up and the two of you go 
shopping? I mean, she felt the same way about Matt that I did. She&#39;d 
understand.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d love to, Mimi, but I&#39;m broke.&quot; Miyako said, her mood lightened 
somewhat by the conversation.

&quot;Alright, how&#39;s this: I&#39;ll have Dad drop by your place with enough 
money for food, a couple of new outfits for each of you, and maybe 
I&#39;ll throw in enough for a movie.&quot;

Miyako smiled at her friend&#39;s generosity. Since Mimi had started her 
modeling career, she had been earning more money than she knew what to 
do with. And nothing pleased her more than spending it on her friends. 
&quot;Thanks, Mimi. Maybe you should&#39;ve had the Crest of Reliability.&quot;

The two friends giggled and said their goodbyes before hanging up. 
Mimi locked up her apartment and stepped out just as Joe pulled up in 
front of her door.

***********************************************************************

Look at the way
We gotta hide what we&#39;re doin&#39;.
&#39;Cause what would they say
If only they knew
And so we&#39;re...

Miyako had been waiting for what seemed like hours for Jun to arrive. 
Mr. Tachikawa had dropped the money off less than an hour after she 
had spoken to Mimi on the phone. Miyako had called Daisuke&#39;s sister 
and, after a brief explanation, Jun had been quick to say she would be 
there faster than Taichi to an all-you-can-eat buffet, which made 
Miyako giggle.

Now, as she sat by her window waiting for Jun&#39;s car to pull up, Miyako 
began thinking that she really should have seen this coming. She 
remembered that Daisuke had become more and more distant over the past 
few months. He called her less, they almost never went anywhere alone, 
and he was always making some lame excuse when she asked him if he was 
busy. She shook herself out of her revelry when she saw a familiar 
blue Dodge Neon come to a stop in front of the door. After briefly 
telling her parents she was leaving, Miyako ran out of the apartment, 
climbed down the fire escape and got into the car.

&quot;Hey, Miyako.&quot; Jun said as she pulled into traffic. &quot;I&#39;m sorry about 
what happened with Daisuke. And you couldn&#39;t exactly say it was to be 
expected. I mean, since when did that type of girl pay attention to 
him?&quot;

This enticed a giggle from Miyako as they pulled away from the 
apartment.

***********************************************************************

Runnin&#39; just as fast as we can...
Holdin&#39; onto one another&#39;s hand...
Tryin&#39; to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say...

After several rigorous hours of mall-crawling and some old American 
movie called &quot;The African Queen&quot;, Jun and Miyako decided it was about 
time to head home.

As they got into Jun&#39;s car, Miyako turned to her and said, &quot;Thank you 
for tonight, Jun. I really needed to just get out and enjoy myself 
without worrying about your brother.&quot;

Jun smiled and said, &quot;There&#39;s no need to thank me. I would&#39;ve been 
there for you anyway.&quot;

Her friend was puzzled by this. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

Turning to her slowly, Jun looked Miyako in the eye and said, &quot;I know 
there&#39;s a gap in our ages, Miyako-chan, but, over the months I saw you 
and my brother together, I ended up falling in love with you.&quot;

Needless to say, the other girl was stunned. When she&#39;d regained her 
composure, she asked, &quot;But, how? I thought you liked guys.&quot;

Jun blushed a little and said, &quot;Well, I do. But I like girls, as well. 
Especially ones that look as good as you do, Miyako.&quot;

I think we&#39;re alone now...
There doesn&#39;t seem to be anyone around.
I think we&#39;re alone now...
The beating of our hearts is the only sound.

Jun sighed and turned away. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I never should have told you. 
At least, not this soon after your breakup with Daisuke.&quot;

Much to the older girl&#39;s surprise, Miyako reached out and touched her 
cheek. &quot;Actually, I&#39;m glad you did tell me. I&#39;ve never felt an 
attraction to girls before, but there&#39;s something about you, Jun. 
I....I.....&quot;

Jun clasped Miyako&#39;s hand with her own. &quot;Go ahead. You can say it.&quot;

&quot;....I love you.&quot; As soon as the lavender-haired girl said that, the 
two found themselves in an embrace, sharing one of the most passionate 
kisses they&#39;d everexperienced. Somehow, they crawled into the back 
seat, where the only sounds that could be heard were the rustling of 
clothing and cries of pleasure.

***********************************************************************

Runnin&#39; just as fast as we can...
Holdin&#39; onto one another&#39;s hand.
Tryin&#39; to get away into the night,
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say...

After their &#39;experience&#39;, the relationship between Jun and Miyako only 
grew stronger as the months went by. Daisuke&#39;s &quot;girlfriend&quot; had left 
him once he lost his job, and try as he might to get her back, Miyako 
refused to return to him.

Eventually, the two girls got an apartment together and Mimi even 
helped them get jobs working as makeup girls in her fashion studio. It 
was easy work, the pay was good, and it left them plenty of time to be 
together.

I think we&#39;re alone now...
There doesn&#39;t seem to be anyone around.
I think we&#39;re alone now...
The beating of out hearts is the only sound.

&quot;So, Jun,&quot; Miyako began as they walked into their apartment. &quot;What was 
it that you couldn&#39;t tell me at work?&quot;

&quot;This.&quot; Jun got down onto one knee and presented Miyako with a diamond 
ring. &quot;I&#39;m not sure if I could marry you or not, but I want this ring 
to be a symbol that we&#39;ll always be together, no matter what happens.&quot;

Tears in her eyes, Miyako took the ring and placed it on her finger. 
&quot;We must be able to read each other&#39;s minds, Jun.&quot; As she said this, 
she gave her love a ring identical in every respect to the one she had 
just been given. Then, they embraced and Miyako said, &quot;Remember your 
promise: No matter what.&quot;

Smiling, Jun said, &quot;How could I ever forget?&quot; And then the two lost 
themselves in a passionate kiss.

Runnin&#39; just as fast as we can...
Holdin&#39; onto one another&#39;s hand.
Tryin&#39; to get away into the night
And then put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say...

I think we&#39;re alone now...
There doesn&#39;t seem to be anyone around.
I think we&#39;re alone now...
The beating of our hearts is the only sound.......
