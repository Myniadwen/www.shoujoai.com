<h1>Kidan (part 6 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/9thchild.html">Shinji Shazaki</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../digimon/kidan-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Hikari took a deep breath, unwilling to open her eyes for a few moments 
more.  She nuzzled against warm skin, her arm limp on a slowly rising 
and falling stomach.  When she managed to make her eyes open, she smiled 
sleepily at the sight she found.  Shinji was still asleep, head tilted 
to one side and her mouth slightly open.

The feeling of happiness and warmth was so deep that Hikari didn&#39;t care 
to think about anything.  She closed her eyes briefly, her head still 
resting on Shinji&#39;s shoulder.  After some time, however, she sat up and 
looked around the room.  The sun was bright and high, lighting the room 
easily.  Hikari blinked in confusion, looking about for a clock.  
Surprised that it was there in the first place, she picked up Shinji&#39;s 
digivice from atop a stack of books next to the bed.

The small screen claimed the time was eight twenty-six.  Hikari, her 
classes having started at eight, was a bit more than surprised.  She 
paled, quickly getting out of the bed.  A neat pile of her clothes was 
sitting at the foot of the bed.  She pulled on a pair of panties and a 
bra, grabbing her uniform&#39;s skirt and shirt while talking angrily to 
herself.  As soon as she was dressed, she paused in confusion and looked 
at Shinji.

Hikari had not been speaking quietly, but Shinji was still sound asleep. 
 A chill swept across Hikari&#39;s skin as she walked to the other woman.  
She reached out and shook Shinji&#39;s shoulder, calling her name.  There 
was no response, no movement from the kunoichi.  Hikari&#39;s stomach 
dropped to the floor and was promptly kicked back up into her body by 
fear.  She thought quickly about everything she had ever been told if 
she came across an injured person.

The woman was breathing; she could see the rise and fall of her chest.  
With a shaking hand, Hikari laid two fingers against Shinji&#39;s neck and 
found a strong pulse.  Overwhelming gratitude to the gods drained Hikari 
of every iota of energy.  She knelt down next to the bed, taking one of 
Shinji&#39;s hands into hers.  It was then that she noticed a letter atop 
another stack of books.  Her name was written on the paper in elegant 
script.  She picked it up and unfolded it, beginning to read.

&quot;Hikari,&quot; the letter read, &quot;don&#39;t worry.  Shinji isn&#39;t dead, as I&#39;m sure 
you have ascertained, nor is she comatose.  She pushed herself too hard 
trying to get back to you, and since I assume you two had a pleasant 
enough night, she must have only worn herself out further.  Shinji will 
need some time to completely heal.  I advise you to watch over her 
yourself for the first few days.  She&#39;ll be all right.  -Vandemon.&quot;

Once again, relief and gratitude filled Hikari to the tips of her 
fingers.  A groan made her look up quickly.  Shinji&#39;s eyes opened and 
immediately found their way to Hikari.  Hikari smiled at her, squeezing 
the other woman&#39;s hand tight.  Shinji smiled as well and squeezed 
Hikari&#39;s hand back.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Hikari asked.  &quot;You wouldn&#39;t wake up.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Shinji replied.  She began to sit up, but Hikari put her 
hands on her shoulders, pushing her back down.

&quot;No you don&#39;t,&quot; Hikari said.  &quot;I don&#39;t believe you&#39;re &#39;fine.&#39;  I saw how 
badly you got hurt.  Now lie back down; you need to rest.&quot;  Shinji 
opened her mouth as if to protest, but Hikari cut her off.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about my classes,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;I&#39;ll call my friend 
Daisuke for my work.&quot;  She pressed her finger against the tip of 
Shinji&#39;s nose, smiling at her.  With a small smile, Shinji kissed 
Hikari&#39;s finger before lying down.

----------

Hikari found her place in Shinji&#39;s home that week.  She gladly watched 
Shinji heal, happy to be so close to the other woman.  Never before had 
she felt such a bond to another human, and never before had she been so 
happy.  As the days passed, Shinji regained her strength.  Hikari was 
amazed each day at the rate at which the kunoichi healed for two 
reasons.  For one, she had seen how close Shinji had come to death.  For 
another reason, Shinji was surprisingly ardent despite her injuries.

It was almost as if she was taking this time to study Hikari&#39;s body and 
learn every pleasurable secret that still had to be discovered.  Hikari 
herself had never imagined of most anything Shinji did to her, but it 
was understandable.  She had never thought much about sex in the first 
place, and never ever thought about sex with another woman.  Rather 
embarrassedly, Hikari asked Shinji one night-as she lay worn-out and 
weary in the other woman&#39;s arms-how she knew so much.  How Shinji 
replied amazed Hikari; she blushed a deep rose.

&quot;I&#39;m well-read,&quot; she muttered.  Sensing a chink in the armor Shinji 
wore, Hikari smirked.

&quot;Well, at least you haven&#39;t had much practice,&quot; she said.  The blush on 
Shinji&#39;s face spread, and Hikari laughed in spite of herself.  She 
pressed her lips against Shinji&#39;s red cheek, curling up tight against 
the older woman.

&quot;I love you,&quot; she murmured before closing her eyes.  The blush on 
Shinji&#39;s face faded, her eyes growing soft.  She held Hikari close, 
kissing her on the forehead.

&quot;I love you, too,&quot; she whispered.  By then, Hikari had already fallen 
asleep.  Shinji soon followed her into the warm darkness.

----------

Early Saturday morning, as Shinji and Hikari sat reading in their bed, 
Hikari closed her book and looked up at her lover.  Sensing Hikari&#39;s 
eyes on her, Shinji put her book aside and looked at her.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I should really get back to school on Monday,&quot; Hikari answered.  &quot;Are 
you going to be all right?&quot;

&quot;Not enough to take you to Odaiba and back,&quot; Shinji murmured.  &quot;But you 
should be able to get to school on time if you take a train.  You can 
take some money if you need it.&quot;

&quot;Would you mind if I went to find out the schedule?&quot;  Shinji smiled and 
ran her fingers through Hikari&#39;s hair.

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; she replied.  &quot;Go ahead.&quot;  She followed the other young 
woman to the front door and bade her goodbye, but stood in the doorway 
for a few minutes.

&quot;How long have you been sleeping in that tree?&quot; Shinji asked, looking up 
into the branches of the tree in her yard.  Tailmon hopped down from a 
high branch, crossing her arms in a dignified manner.

&quot;Well, you two seem so lovey-dovey that I didn&#39;t want to disturb you,&quot; 
the digimon muttered sarcastically.  &quot;Besides, it&#39;s not like either of 
you were worried about me.&quot;

&quot;You might not be a big digimon, but you&#39;ve got more than enough power 
to take care of yourself,&quot; Shinji murmured.  &quot;Hikari will be happy that 
you&#39;re here.&quot;  She sighed suddenly, leaning against the doorframe.  
Tailmon stepped forward in spite of herself, concern overpowering her 
for a brief moment.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Shinji said shortly.  &quot;I&#39;m just...still a little weak.  
Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;  Tailmon turned away from her and lifted her 
nose, crossing her arms again.

&quot;Who said I was worried?&quot; she demanded.  Shinji sighed again and turned 
away.  She paused and looked over her shoulder.

&quot;You can come in,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;Close the door behind you.&quot;  She 
walked back inside, and Tailmon soon followed.

----------

&quot;I&#39;m going, you two.  Don&#39;t fight with each other, OK?&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t promise anything.&quot;  Hikari laughed at Tailmon&#39;s curt reply.  
She put her hand on Shinji&#39;s shoulder and stood on her toes, kissing the 
older woman goodbye.  She jogged away, waving as she went.  Tailmon&#39;s 
ears drooped as Hikari vanished around a corner.

&quot;I hate it when she goes to school,&quot; she grumbled.

&quot;I know what you mean,&quot; Shinji sighed.  A twinge went off in the back of 
her neck suddenly.  She looked about, seeing men in black suits standing 
on street corners.  All of them had been watching Hikari walk away.

&quot;Get inside,&quot; she growled.  Tailmon looked up in surprise.  Shinji&#39;s 
eyes had gone cold and angry, a sneer pulling at her face.

&quot;Get inside,&quot; she repeated.  Once Tailmon was in the door, she closed it 
slowly, as if restraining herself.  She walked quickly to the phone and 
picked it up, her fingers playing over the keypad.  She waited only a 
few moments before speaking.

&quot;I need to speak with you,&quot; she said.  &quot;Today.  Now.&quot;  There was a 
pause, but Tailmon could not hear what was said.  &quot;Yes sir, I 
understand, but I need you to come here.&quot;  Another pause.  &quot;I can&#39;t come 
to your office.  I was...injured, recently.&quot;  Pause.  &quot;Sir, I can&#39;t 
explain over the phone.  You need to come here, and as quickly as you 
can.&quot;  Pause.  &quot;Thank you.  I&#39;ll see you soon.&quot;  She put the phone down, 
sighing and leaning against the wall.

&quot;What was that about?&quot; Tailmon demanded.  Shinji turned her head, 
staring at the digimon with a cold sweat on her brow.  After a moment, 
she rubbed her eyes and wiped away the sweat.

&quot;You&#39;ll see in a few minutes,&quot; she explained.  &quot;I need to talk to the 
Prime Minister.&quot;  Tailmon&#39;s eyes went wide.

&quot;Th-the Prime Minister?&quot; she gasped.  Shinji turned away and did not 
answer.

Within twenty minutes, someone knocked at the door.  Shinji went to the 
door and opened it.  A nondescript man with small glasses and short 
black hair stood on the step.  He wore a plain suit and a soft smile.

&quot;Hello, Shinji,&quot; he said in greeting.  His brown eyes glanced over the 
woman.  He raised his eyebrows in surprise.  Shinji bowed and let him 
inside.  He walked in, slipping his shoes off and donning a pair of 
guest slippers.

&quot;How many years has it been?&quot; the man asked.  &quot;Eight, isn&#39;t it?  The 
last I saw you was when you had been admitted to the hospital for that 
stab wound in your stomach.  You never actually explained how you 
received that wound-or how your parents died.  Are you finally going to 
tell me what happened?&quot;  Shinji was momentarily taken aback.

&quot;Yes,&quot; she admitted.  &quot;Eight years ago, during the first incident with 
the digital monsters, the digimon, my parents were murdered by one of 
the digimon.  I went to the Digital World with the eight other children 
that were involved.  I fought the digimon that murdered my parents and 
killed him, but he stabbed me.  I would have died, had my own digimon 
partner not saved me and sent me back here.

&quot;At that time, I ignored the men you stationed around my house because I 
had no reason to be bothered by them.  I want you to call them away 
now.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;ve known all this time?&quot; he asked.  &quot;Why do you want them sent 
away if you tolerated them until now?&quot;

&quot;I have someone precious to me that I want to protect,&quot; Shinji said 
sharply.  &quot;I have taken on a large number of digimon for her.  I&#39;ve come 
close to death for her.  All I want now is to be left in peace with 
her.&quot;

&quot;Her?&quot; the Prime Minister inquired.  &quot;You&#39;re asking to leave the post 
your family has held for all these years and live with a woman-no hope 
for an heir to carry on your business?&quot;

&quot;I only want our home to be left alone,&quot; Shinji replied.  &quot;For you to 
leave Hikari out of my business.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;ll be hard to keep your lover in the dark on your doings.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve already told her about my family.&quot;

&quot;Then she must know that if you ever have a child-however that may 
happen-they will be trained in your family&#39;s art.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t promise that.  I won&#39;t break Hikari&#39;s heart.  I&#39;ll remain a 
kunoichi, and if such a thing happens-if we have a child-, I might teach 
them Shazaki ninjutsu-ryu.  Please, I want for us to be left alone.&quot;  
She bowed low, sinking to her knees and putting her head to the ground.  
The Prime Minister regarded her silently for a few moments.

&quot;You have been a faithful weapon for our country,&quot; he murmured.  &quot;I 
cannot deny that.&quot;  He paused again.  &quot;Very well.  I will call my men 
away and leave you two in peace.&quot;  Shinji sat back on her legs, her head 
still bowed in gratitude towards the man.  He put his hand on her 
shoulder, making her look up.

&quot;Tell your Hikari that she is very lucky,&quot; he said with a smile.  He 
went back to the door and put his shoes back on.  He turned around 
briefly.  &quot;I may call on you if our country needs your talents.  
Goodbye, Shinji, and good luck.&quot;  He left quietly, leaving behind a 
confused digimon (who had been hiding) and a grateful woman.

When Hikari returned that afternoon, Shinji greeted her happily and with 
a smile.  Hikari was glad to be home.
