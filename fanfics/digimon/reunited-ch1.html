<h1>Reunited: A Tale of Rika and Renamon (part 1 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The new Hypnos Central looked very different than it&#39;s original 
design. Instead of the giant dome screen, they now used several 
standard computer terminals. The bodysuits were gone, and more casual 
clothing was the norm. But the greatest change was the complete 
removal of all the equipment created for the destruction of Digimon. 
That sort of thing was no longer part of the purpose that Hypnos was 
now meant to serve.

Riley sat in her pants and sweatshirt in front of one of the two 
primary terminals, working alongside Daisy to help Hypnos monitor the 
remarkably thin border that existed between Earth and the many levels 
of the Digital world. They tracked any of the bio-emergences, and then 
determined the status of the Digimon who appeared.

The data types of Digimon were normally left in peace, unless they 
actually became harmful to humanity. Virus types, on the other hand, 
were encouraged to return to the Digital world where they belonged, by 
the use of force if it was needed.

A soft tone focused Riley&#39;s attention to her screen, and after double- 
checking the data she announced, &quot;We&#39;ve picked up the initial traces 
of a bio-emergence. It&#39;s in Tokyo, near the center of the city, 
refining location now.&quot;

Daisy, sitting across the room from her, quickly bent over her own 
terminal. &quot;Confirmed,&quot; she agreed with Riley calmly, &quot;Tokyo, in the 
central park,&quot; she continued as she consulted her own monitor and ran 
through the standard procedures. A field team was activated, though 
they wouldn&#39;t move out unless a virus was confirmed.

&quot;Is it a Digimon we know?&quot; Yamaki asked them both calmly. His 
trademark black shades were long gone, but he still stuck with his 
formal wear as he calmly walked across the computer lab in a dark blue 
business suit.

&quot;I&#39;m checking the data against our records,&quot; Riley reported calmly. 
They heard the computers run for a few moments, and then &quot;We have a 
match, it&#39;s...&quot; She stopped, looking surprised. A grin stretched 
across her face, &quot;Sir come look at this!&quot; She rolled her office chair 
away from the screen to give him room to look

He bent over the monitor curiously, reading the data she had called up 
there. A smile spread across his face too as he said, &quot;Well, well, 
looks like an old friend has finally made it back.&quot; He walked over to 
his desk and grabbed his coat, pulling it on as he said, &quot;Riley, you 
drove your car here today, right? Why don&#39;t we go let the tamer know?&quot;

&quot;We could just send them an e-mail,&quot; Riley helpfully suggested, even 
as she stood up from her own chair to grab her coat as well. &#39;Hey, any 
reason to get out of the office for awhile!&#39; she thought with a happy 
smile.

Yamaki laughed softly as he replied with a grin, &quot;Sometimes, you just 
have to do out and do things in person.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll stay and hold down the fort,&quot; Daisy said with a melodramatic 
sigh. Of course, once Riley and Yamaki had left, she flopped down in 
her seat, brought up her favorite website, and laughed as she read the 
latest posts.



They stood together at the front door, looking rather hesitant for two 
such very powerful government officials. After exchanging a few 
worried glances, Yamaki finally mustered his courage, and knocked on 
it gently. They heard the sound of quick footsteps, and the door 
opened. Yamaki saw who it was, and his face grew pale.

Rika&#39;s Grandmother stood in the doorway and glared at the two of them 
with such force that poor Yamaki took an involuntary half step 
backward to try and escape. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s you two again,&quot; she said with a 
fierce looking frown, &quot;you haven&#39;t come back here to try to recruit 
Rika for that damned organization you work for, again?&quot;

Riley had to cover her mouth with her hand to conceal her impish 
smile. She loved watching the tough older woman turn the determined 
executive that Yamaki was back into a little kid receiving a scolding 
from an adult.

&quot;Oh no, no&quot; Yamaki quickly protested his innocence, waving his hands 
in front of him frantically, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t think of it!&quot;

&quot;So why, exactly are you two here, then?&quot; Grandmother demanded, not 
letting up with the fierce frown.

Riley bowed to her respectfully, &quot;We were wondering if we could speak 
with Rika for a moment? We have some important news for her.&quot;

Grandmother relaxed a bit, and gave a smiling nod just to Riley. 
&quot;Certainly, I&#39;ll go get her. Please sit in the living room,&quot; she 
instructed them as she went to get Rika.

&quot;How do you do that?&quot; Yamaki asked Riley with an envious sigh. He 
wished he could charm the older lady like Riley was able to.

Riley sighed softly. &quot;She doesn&#39;t blame me for what happened to 
Renamon,&quot; Riley answered him sadly.

Yamaki visibly winced at that.

Grandmother checked Rika&#39;s bedroom first, only to find the small room 
empty. She walked down the corridor and listened at the door at the 
end of the hall. The soft sound of rapid typing, and soothing 
instrumental music could be heard coming from the small office that 
they had constructed for Rika&#39;s personal use. She knocked on the 
closed door gently, and after a moment heard the typing stop and a 
voice answer, &quot;Come in.&quot;

Rika sat in front of the powerful computer, a focused expression on 
her face as she stared at the body of text she had just written on the 
screen. The twenty year old had matured into a beautiful looking young 
woman. &#39;No, not beautiful,&#39; her Grandmother had to admit, &#39;she&#39;s more 
handsome, really.&#39; She wore her red hair short on top, with a long, 
braided tail swinging down the back. She stuck with wearing jeans and 
T-shirts, mostly, but she would dress up on special occasions, or at 
her mother&#39;s rare insistence.

Her eyes were inevitably drawn to the large bookcase, and the section 
that held the several books Rika had written under her professional 
pseudonym. Mostly high fantasy, a few science fiction, and even a 
romance novel or two, all of them published under another name Rika 
had chosen in a moment of mischief: Rena Monica.

&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; Rika asked, getting up and stretching out the many kinks 
sitting at the desk sometimes gave her. She looked at the screen as if 
by sheer force of will she could tame the unruly words that rested 
there.

&quot;Those two are back again, supposedly with important news,&quot; 
Grandmother answered with a wry smile on her face.

&quot;They came back?&quot; Rika echoed. She grinned, &quot;Gee, Yamaki must be 
braver than I thought, to come back after the flaying you gave him.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t flay,&quot; Grandmother answered Rika with falsely wounded 
dignity. &quot;I merely pointed out,&quot; she said with a bit of real anger, 
&quot;what a totally dirty, underhanded thing they did to you and your 
friends, all those years ago.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re preaching to the converted,&quot; Rika answered her with a smile. 
The slightly taller girl put her arm over her Grandmother&#39;s shoulders 
comfortingly, &quot;Let&#39;s go find out what they want so we can get them out 
of here as soon as possible.&quot;

Yamaki sat up straight, forgetting the cookie he had been eating, 
leaving it hanging half out of his mouth. A quick elbow to the ribs 
from Riley jogged him enough to chew and swallow, and he chased it 
down with a bit of tea.

&quot;So what do you want?&quot; Rika demanded.

Rika really didn&#39;t like Yamaki, even though she did feel forced to 
respect him, just a little. It couldn&#39;t have been easy to run the 
small- scale war against the D-Reaper, but he had done it, maybe 
helping save the whole world in the process. But his means to that end 
had cost her dearly, and for that she would never forgive him.

&quot;We&#39;ve picked up the early signs of a bio-emergence in Tokyo,&quot; Yamaki 
said calmly. &quot;The data we&#39;ve gathered is partial, and the conclusions 
we&#39;ve drawn are tentative, but...&quot;

Getting tired of her boss beating around the bush, Riley finally had 
to burst out, &quot;We think it might be Renamon!&quot;

Rika and her Grandmother looked at the two of them in stunned silence. 
Rika recovered first, &quot;What are we waiting for? Lets go!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll drive you,&quot; Yamaki said, quickly getting to his feet.

&quot;I&#39;m going too,&quot; Rika&#39;s grandmother said firmly. Yamaki looked like he 
wanted to argue, but one of her frowns quieted him down.

A few moments later they were on their way, Rika and her Grandmother 
in the back, Yamaki riding shotgun up front with Riley. They were 
going to the park where the Digimon had disappeared from this world, 
all those years ago.

&quot;I wonder why she&#39;s coming back there?&quot; Rika asked herself 
thoughtfully.

Yamaki took it as a serious question. &quot;We&#39;re not entirely sure. The 
Monster makers think there&#39;s a degree of weakness in the border 
between worlds there,&quot; Yamaki said, keeping most of his concentration 
on his driving. Looking for something to fill the car&#39;s silence, &quot;So, 
uhm, how&#39;s the new book going?&quot;

Riley elbowed him in the ribs, again. &#39;That has to be the worst thing 
to ask an author,&#39; she thought to herself wearily.

Rika smiled wryly to her Grandmother, who rolled her eyes. &quot;I&#39;m on the 
final stretch,&quot; Rika said with a small smile, &quot;just a few chapters to 
go.&quot;

Riley smiled a little as she used the opening to ask Rika, &quot;Has the 
trouble over your last novel died down yet?&quot;

&quot;Mostly,&quot; Rika answered, smiling impishly.

Before she could say anything else, the car rolled to a stop and they 
quickly disembarked. Riley helped Rika out and Yamaki chivalrously 
offered a hand to Grandmother. They stood a moment at the gateway, 
until a soft beeping could be heard.

Rika quickly reached into her pocket and pulled out her digivice, 
which was emitting the soft beeps. An arrow was on the small screen, 
pointing into the park. &quot;Looks like we&#39;re in the right place,&#39; Rika 
said, walking forward.

In just a few moments they stood on an open section by a pond, and the 
readout indicated that they had reached their destination. There was 
haziness in the air, almost like rippled glass, and a hint of movement 
behind it. The digivice began to glow softly, then suddenly shot a 
beam of energy right into the distortion.

&quot;Remarkable,&quot; Yamaki said softly, even as the distortion seemed to 
stabilize a little bit. The pixilation effect they had seen before 
appeared and began to expand, until it was nearly human height. A 
figure appeared, then carefully stepped through.

&quot;Renamon?&quot; Rika asked softly. Then, &quot;Renamon!&quot; as she ran forward. The 
fox Digimon clasped Rika close and twirled her around, nearly picking 
her off the ground.

&quot;Rika,&quot; Renamon said softly, holding the young woman close to her. She 
had been a bit surprised at how much Rika had grown, hoe much time had 
actually passed, but she would know her tamer anywhere!

&#39;The distortion and the pixilation are both done,&#39; Riley mentally 
noted. She gestured as subtlety as possible to both Yamaki and Rika&#39;s 
Grandmother as she quietly said, &quot;Let&#39;s give them some time alone, 
shall we?&quot;

Grandmother nodded, following Riley away, Yamaki just behind them.

&quot;You have no idea how much I&#39;ve missed you,&quot; Rika said softly, her 
face against Renamon&#39;s soft shoulder.

&quot;I&#39;ve missed you, too Rika. I just wish I could have returned to you 
sooner,&quot; Renamon said quietly. &quot;The digital world was in ruins when we 
returned, and all the Digimon&#39;s efforts were needed to try and restore 
it,&quot; she explained. &quot;There&#39;s still much to do,&quot; she finished, &quot;but all 
the sovereign Digimon released me, Gillmon and Terriermon to return to 
our human partners.&quot;

Rika began to sniffle a bit, then she started crying. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; 
Rika said, wiping at her eyes, &quot;it&#39;s just I&#39;m so happy to see you.&quot;

&quot;I feel much the same,&quot; Renamon softly answered, her hands still 
gently resting on Rika&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Do you think,&quot; Renamon asked her 
shyly, &quot;we could go... home?&quot;

&quot;Yes, please,&quot; Rika said with a smile, wiping a few tears away. 
&#39;Renamon thinks of the house as home,&#39; she thought to herself happily. 
&quot;Only, how?&quot; she asked with a frown, as they walked together towards 
Riley&#39;s small car.

Renamon smiled, bowing respectfully to Rika&#39;s Grandmother, &quot;It&#39;s good 
to see you.&quot; She looked a great deal more dubiously over at Riley and 
Yamaki, standing nearby.

&quot;It&#39;s good to have you back,&quot; Riley said, her sincerity obvious in her 
voice.

Yamaki looked a bit embarrassed. &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve returned,&quot; he said, 
then hesitantly added, &quot;and I&#39;m sorry, for what I did.&quot;

Renamon looked over at Yamaki considering, even as Rika simply gaped 
at him in honest surprise. &#39;I guess I never would have thought he&#39;d 
apologize,&#39; Rika thought, deeply startled by his atypical actions.

&quot;I saw the damage the D-Reaper did to the Digital World,&quot; Renamon 
finally said, then smiled at him gently, &quot;I can understand you wanting 
to prevent it here.&quot; Yamaki&#39;s shoulders seemed to rise, almost as if 
he had been released from a great weight he had carried for far too 
long.

Rika&#39;s Grandmother looked a bit disapproving, it was obvious she was 
much less willing to forgive and forget. &quot;It&#39;s nice to have you back,&quot; 
she said with a smile, and then hugged the surprised Digimon. It was 
pretty funny, Renamon standing there stiff as a board until she 
relaxed enough to gently hug the older woman back.

Renamon looked at the three, a small smile on her face. &quot;Would the 
rest of you mind meeting me and Rika back at the house?&quot; she asked 
them courteously.

&quot;Certainly,&quot; Yamaki said, after exchanging a gaze with Riley and 
Rika&#39;s Grandmother, &quot;but how are you... ?&quot;

In a single motion, Renamon swept Rika up into her arms, eliciting a 
loud squeal of surprise. She bent her knees a bit, then leapt high up 
into the nearest tree&#39;s branches. They saw her bounding away, and 
heard Rika&#39;s faint laughter receding into the distance.

&quot;Just like a prince holding a princess,&quot; Riley said with a small 
smile. She looked sideways at Grandmother as she asked, &quot;That doesn&#39;t 
worry you?&quot;

The older woman smiled to herself serenely, &quot;As long as Rika&#39;s happy, 
I think I&#39;ll manage.&quot; Then she shrugged a bit, &quot;Besides, it could be 
worse. She could have brought that Rio boy home.&quot; She made a face at 
that.

Yamaki smiled, shaking his head, while Riley just laughed. </pre>
