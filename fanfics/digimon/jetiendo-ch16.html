Cowell wasn&#39;t making it easier, yet they still made room to misbehave. 

&quot;SPOONA&quot; Davis roared 

&quot;Davis Motomiya&quot; Simon Cowell called &quot; in my office now&quot; 

The class all looked at him. 

&quot; Naughty&quot; Ant snapped pointing at Davis &quot; teach you to throw Brussels 
sprouts at me. Naughty boy&quot; 

&quot;Very naughty indeed&quot; Dec agreed 

Davis followed Simon Cowell to his office, which was very stylish and it 
expressed how rich he was 

&quot;Sit down&quot; Simon Cowell smiled. As Davis sat down Simon Cowell started 
to smile &quot; Davis tell me why you are here&quot; 

&quot;Because&quot; Davis started &quot; I have the w-w-worst v-vocal in the trip&quot; 

&quot; Can you think of any other reason?&quot; Simon asked 

&quot; I insult the dead and I&#39;m ill behaved,&quot; confessed Davis 

&quot;Well, those are good reasons to bring you here&quot; Simon replied &quot; but I 
wanted to talk about something else, it&#39;s about your cousin Ash,&quot; 

&quot; What about my cousin?&quot; Davis asked 

&quot; You sneaked him and his friends in this trip&quot; confronted Simon 

&quot;OK&quot; Davis announced, &quot;I did&quot; 

&quot;Well since they didn&#39;t go to school and have a proper education that 
leads to the punishment&quot; Simon hissed &quot; and your punishment is....&quot; 10 
second delay &quot; do their exams for them&quot; 

&quot;You brought them here,&quot; Simon reminded him &quot; so it&#39;s your 
responsibility for the four of them&quot; 

&quot;Ash and May,&quot; Davis said &quot; where the two who got taken away by the 
military&quot; 

&quot; Well in that case&quot; Simon Cowell started &quot; I&#39;ll think of an alterative 
punishment&quot; 

&quot;Yes sir&quot; Davis said 

&quot; Off you go&quot; 

As soon as Davis left the office and returned to the class he was filled 
with laughter as every one wanted to know what he said 

&quot;I think he took it quite well,&quot; Davis said to the class
