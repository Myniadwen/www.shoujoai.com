~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
A girl stood mesmerized as she saw a girl standing fixed in the middle 
of a set of train tracks as the train it self came rushing closer to 
her. Kari finally snapping out of her daze and started running to the 
girl on the tracks yelling at her to move but the girl did not seem to 
hear Kari&#146;s cries and stood there fixed to the spot. As Kari got closer 
to the girl so did the train and as soon as Kari got close to the girl, 
all went dark and Kari woke up in a sweat.   

Beams of morning sun came through the somewhat closed curtains. As Kari 
got up and sat on the side of her bed she couldn&#146;t help but look at the 
picture of Sora she had in a heart-shaped picture frame and smiled &#145;Why 
do I keep having these dreams about you Sora?&#146; Kari thought as she 
looked in to the picture. Kari had never told Sora that she loved her 
because for one she did not know how to tell Sora and two, She was 
scared to. Eventually Kari looked at her alarm clock and nearly flipped, 
she was suppose to meet her friends at the music store in two hours 
today (just like every Saturday). Soon Kari stopped thinking of Sora and 
got in to the shower, she let the hot water warm her body and wake her 
up, then she got dressed wearing; Her dark blue jeans, Her Purple and 
white T-shirt and her heart shaped locket with Sora&#146;s picture in side 
it. 

It was nearly one O&#146;clock and Kari had only ten minutes to get to the 
music store in the mall but she was knew she could make it. Finally she 
got there with only one minute to spare, there where three other people 
in the store, a tall girl wearing a long dark green skirt and a red 
sweater, she also had a purple bandana over her long brown hair and was 
wearing glasses. The next person was a man roughly 22 years old and was 
wearing a green-no-sleeve shirt and blue jeans; the guys&#146; dirty blond 
hair spiked up crazily. Finally the last guy was dressed in a tattered 
old leather jacket, torn black jeans and chains coming from the front of 
his jeans to the back of his jeans and his somewhat golden hair was 
spiked backwards. The third guy was flirting with the girl at the 
counter until he saw Kari and yelled with joy &quot;Kari, finally you got 
here we were starting to worry about you&quot;. T.K. said so that the other 
two could hear &quot;Yeah, right, you would have cared when you were done 
flirting&quot; Matt laughed. &quot;Well, the good thing is you&#146;re here, so are you 
going to ask her out today or what?&quot; Yolie asked, when Kari heard this 
it made her blush a deep shade of red, &quot;Well...Um...I don&#146;t really know 
about today&quot;, Kari said nervously. &quot;Yolie, what kind of question is 
that?&quot; T.K. asked her in a disappointed way &quot;Well, I guess not a very 
good one...&quot; Yolie answered &quot;Okay, Kari go buy the guitar you wanted and 
then let&#146;s go get some food.&quot; suggested Matt.

As the two friends walked through the mall, Sora just couldn&#146;t stop 
thinking about the dream she had about Kari and her, she was thinking 
about the dream so much that Mimi final realized what her friend was 
doing. &quot;So you&#146;re still thinking about that dream, eh?&quot; Mimi asked, 
&quot;Yeah, I just don&#146;t get it.  I&#146;m standing on a set of train tracks and I 
can&#146;t move, and Kari is trying to save me from the train come straight 
for me, and just before she saves me every thing goes dark.&quot; said Sora 
confused  &quot;Well, maybe your attracted to her?&quot; Mimi stated and with this 
Sora turned a bright red, &quot;Well...um I...um...kinda...&quot; but before Sora could 
finish, a yell of pain came from inside Mimi&#146;s restaurant. The two 
friends looked at each other and start to run to the restaurant. 
Finally, the two of them got there and Mimi look shocked &quot;Oh my god, 
honey are you okay?!&quot; &quot;Yeah, I will be soon.&quot; Ryan said angrily. Ryan 
was Sora&#146;s older brother and Mimi&#146;s husband. Ryan moved his hand a way 
from his face and Sora and Mimi could see his flesh healing rapidly. The 
last time Ryan was in the digital world, he was fused with a virus that 
gave him regenerate powers, enhanced strength and stamina, but it also 
gave him an evil side which he keep under control. &quot;Anyway as I was 
saying before, maybe you are attracted to Kari?&quot; Mimi repeated at this 
Ryan slapped Sora on the back friendly and said, &quot;Finally, I knew you 
liked Kari&quot; and with that Sora and Mimi looked at Ryan with a confused 
look on their faces. &quot;How do you know that?&quot; Mimi asked him &quot;Come on, 
Sora&#146;s my little sister, do you really think that I wouldn&#146;t know who my 
sister likes, anyway, she some times talks in her sleep so yeah.&quot; Sora 
could not believe her ears, her brother and her best friend had known 
that she liked Kari. &quot;Well I don&#146;t know if I should tell her or not...&quot; 
said Sora. Then with that, Ryan turned into the wise older brother he 
was &quot;Listen to me Sis, if you really love her, true love will conquer 
all, you hear me?&quot; Sora nodded and Ryan continued &quot;So you go and tell 
Kari your true feelings for her when you&#39;re ready, okay?&quot; &quot;Okay, Ryan, 
thanks&quot; &quot;Hey, no problem, that&#146;s what brothers are for, right?&quot;

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

After Kari and her friends got some lunch the four of them had decided 
to go window-shopping. (This had been Yolie&#146;s idea after Matt suggested 
they go find Sora so Kari could tell her how she feels, that was shot 
down when T.K. said &quot;That&#146;s the stupidest thing I have ever heard, you 
idiot!&quot; This resulted in a fifteen-minute fistfight between the two 
brothers that nearly got them all kicked out). Kari was sitting on the 
bench outside the computer shop that Matt wanted to check out. It had 
been half an hour since Yolie had decided to go widow shopping to help 
Kari get Sora of her mind (Which she had done). Then as Kari was sitting 
on the bench, she kept thinking of how she would tell Sora that she 
loved her, again and again in her mind. Nearly 10 minutes later Matt 
came out of the shop, and looking at his friends, he said, &quot; Come on, 
let&#146;s get out of here!&quot; &quot;What?...why?&quot; asked T.K. and Yolie at the same 
time &quot;I have been banned from the mall for two weeks, and if they see me 
here before two weeks are over I&#146;m banned for life!&quot; As the three friend 
started to leave, T.K. looked back at Kari who was still sitting on the 
beach &quot;You coming, or what?&#146; he said, &quot;No, I think I&#146;m going to stay 
here, okay?&quot; Kari said &quot;Okay, but let me take your guitar so you don&#146;t 
have to carry it around with you...?&quot; T.K. asked and with a nod she gave 
her guitar to T.K. and walked off.  

It was nearly three O&#146;clock when Kari sat down by the fountain, she kept 
trying to push Sora out of her mind, but the more she tried the more she 
thought about Sora. Finally Kari decided to leave (seeing as she was 
most likely not going to tell Sora that she loved her) but as Kari was 
leaving someone crashed into her, making her fall to the ground and 
knocking the air out of her. Before she could respond, she heard the 
sweet heavenly voice of a young woman. &quot;Oh my god Kari, I&#146;m so sorry! 
Here, let me help you up!&quot; Sora said with her hand outstretched, Sora 
was wearing short-short jeans, which showed off her amazing legs, a dark 
blue tan-top with a red heart on it. Her red hair was slightly combed 
back making her seem even beautiful (If it was possible?). Kari could 
not believe it the woman she loved was talking to her. With that Kari 
made up her mind and decided to tell Sora she loved her. After Kari had 
gotten to her feet, she looked in Sora&#146;s eyes &quot;Sora, I have some thing I 
need to tell you...&quot; &quot;You do...?&quot; Sora said &quot;Sora I...I...I love you Sora...
please don&#146;t hate me....please....&quot; Kari said in a shy and nervous voice. 
At first Sora was shocked, but then she smiled and before Kari could react, 
Sora had placed her soft warm lips upon her own. &#145;I can&#146;t believe this is 
happing...!&#146; Kari thought, just then Sora pulled away from Kari and looked 
in her brown eyes &quot;I love you too Kari, I just never knew how to tell 
you...&quot; 

Just then Sora placed her hands on Kari&#146;s shoulders and placed her lips 
on Kari&#146;s again, this time the kiss was deeper, more passionate. Kari 
could feel Sora&#146;s tongue pushing agents her lips and with that she 
placed her hands on Sora&#146;s waist and pulled her closer to her own body, 
opening her mouth to let her tongue intertwine. Kari didn&#146;t know how 
long they stood there; she was in heaven that was all that mattered that 
she was with the person she loved. Eventually Sora pulled away and 
looked at Kari &quot; You are so beautiful, Kari do you know that?&quot; Sora 
asked, &quot;Now I do...&quot; Kari answered &quot;Shall we tell them?&quot; Kari suggested 
&quot;Okay, Let&#146;s go!&quot; Sora answered and with that the two lovers walked of 
hand in hand to tell their friends.
