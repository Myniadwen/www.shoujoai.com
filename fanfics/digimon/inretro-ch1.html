***********************************************************************

As I stand here and watch Mimi Tachikawa, my one, true love, being 
lowered into the ground inside a bright pink casket as Koushiro Izumi 
plays &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; on his bagpipes, I cannot help but remember the 
last few days of her life.

It began like any normal Saturday night for us. We went to her 
favorite restaurant, Chez Paris, followed by a new movie at the local 
theater, and then to our favorite bench in the park to watch the 
sunset. After which, when we found we were alone, we expressed our 
love for each other on the soft grass by the lake.

After more than an hour in the park, we decided it was time to head 
home. I suggested a shortcut through an alleyway that we usually 
avoided because a gang known as the NightHawks had chosen it as a 
hangout. It looked quiet at the time, so I figured it was safe. I was 
wrong.

We were about halfway through when they jumped us. We tried to run, 
but they cut off both exits. Mimi and I were trapped. One of them came 
up behind me and I felt a hard blow to the back of my skull. Next 
thing I knew, I was being bound and gagged and being forced to watch 
as they stripped Mimi of her pink silk dress. What they did after that 
made me angrier than I&#39;d ever been in my life.

I was forced to watch as they had their way with her. I saw blood 
coming from various cuts on her body, saw them beating her with 
wrenches, pipes, boards, just whatever was laying around or they had 
in their pockets. Soon, whether because of blood loss or sheer 
exhaustion I&#39;ll never know, she lost consciousness. I panicked when 
one of them came at me with a large, bloody butcher knife. My panic 
was short-lived, however.

From about twenty feet away, I heard a loud chorus of barks and 
growls, which caused the NightHawks to scatter. A few seconds later, 
more than a dozen cops and police dogs ran into the alley. They saw 
Mimi and immediately called for an ambulance. They untied me and asked 
me what happened. They looked a bit surprised when I told them Mimi 
was my girlfriend (it must have been our ages), but they got us both 
to Odaiba Medical within the hour.

Doctor Kido said that, aside from the blood loss, Mimi had a mild 
concussion and would have to be hospitalized for at least two weeks. 
When she regained consciousness, I asked our families if they could 
leave us alone for a while. They knew of our relationship, and granted 
us the time with nothing less than an approving smile.

After talking to her for almost an hour, I found out that Mimi didn&#39;t 
blame me for what happened. She said I couldn&#39;t have known. That made 
me feel a little better, but it still didn&#39;t alleviate all the guilt I 
felt.

After her meal and shower the next morning, (the latter of which I 
shared with her), Mimi slipped into unconsciousness. Panicking, I hit 
the button to summon a doctor, who explained that it was a coma 
induced by the concussion and that she would probably wake up in a day 
or so. She didn&#39;t.

During the week that she was unconscious, I didn&#39;t know what to do. I 
went to Yamato Ishida, Mimi&#39;s one-time boyfriend. I&#39;mnot sure how, but 
we ended up in the back of his father&#39;s van. He told me not to worry 
about it, that Mimi would have wanted it to happen. Somehow, I didn&#39;t 
think so.

Three days later, Mimi woke up. I cried as I told her what happened 
with Yamato. I expected her to be angry with me, but all she did was 
smile and say that it was a normal human reaction to seek comfort and 
that she would have done the same thing had I been in the coma. 
Somehow, though, I think she was crying inside.

That evening, she went to sleep before her medications were due. When 
the nurse came in with her pills, Mimi didn&#39;t wake up. The doctors 
administered several stimulants over the course of the night, but she 
remained asleep. Before dawn came, Mimi&#39;s heart stopped.

The doctors did everything they could, but even the life-support 
machines weren&#39;t working. She was declared dead before noon. That was 
three days ago.

Now, as I stand here at her funeral, I cannot believe she is gone. On 
her gravestone, it says, &quot;Mimi Tachikawa, beloved daughter and friend. 
Those who knew her will feel regret for those that never would.&quot;

That&#39;s not stretching the truth in the slightest. I don&#39;t understand 
why Mimi had to die, or why there are people like the NightHawks, but 
there are things in this world I do understand.

Mimi Tachikawa was in love with me, and I was - no, AM - in love with 
her. I know this better than anyone, for I am Hikari Yagami.
