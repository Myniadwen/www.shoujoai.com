<h1>Kidan (part 4 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/9thchild.html">Shinji Shazaki</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../digimon/kidan-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Shinji hummed softly, her mind wandering slightly as she rode steadily 
onwards back to Akasaka.  For the first time that she could remember, 
her birthday had finally been a happy one.  She smiled slightly.  
Happiness.  The feeling, one she had rarely felt in twenty-one years, 
was still a little bit foreign against all the anger she had harbored 
for all her life.

I wonder why there&#39;s a cat running into my yard, she thought silently, 
looking up ahead.  That cat looks familiar-Tailmon?  Why is Tailmon 
here?  Unless...it can&#39;t be.  She turned sharply and slid to a stop by 
the tree in her yard.

&quot;Tailmon, what happened to Hikari?&quot; she asked quickly, her heart leaping 
into her head.

&quot;How did you know something happened?&quot; Tailmon questioned in return.

&quot;You would never come here willingly,&quot; Shinji answered.  &quot;Now what 
happened?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; Tailmon said desperately.  &quot;I got back to Hikari&#39;s room 
before you two got back to the Real World, but when Hikari came back, 
she and her mother started screaming at each other!  It was because 
Hikari skipped school to go to the Digital World with you, but then 
Hikari said that she likes you and her mother told her to get out!  She 
went into the Digital World alone!&quot;  Shinji paled sharply, her heart 
slowing even faster.

&quot;She did what?&quot; she asked.

&quot;She ran away into the Digital World!&quot; Tailmon replied.

&quot;Why did you run after me?&quot; Shinji snapped.  &quot;Taichi must live in Odaiba 
at least!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re the only one Hikari&#39;s going to listen to!&quot; Tailmon shouted in 
reply.  &quot;You&#39;re the one that she&#39;s going to want to look at!&quot;  There was 
a moment&#39;s pause as Shinji let out a snarling sigh.

&quot;Why am I standing here?&quot; she asked aloud, but neither to herself nor to 
Tailmon.  Without another word, she turned and ran into her house.  
Tailmon, already having been left behind by someone running off, tore 
after her.

&quot;Tailmon, go back to Odaiba!&quot; Shinji called over her shoulder, running 
up a flight of stairs three at a time.  &quot;Find all the Chosen Children 
you can and tell them to track Hikari and I down!  I&#39;m going to find 
her!&quot;

&quot;Why shouldn&#39;t I go with you?&quot; Tailmon asked, bounding into the room 
that Shinji had run into.  &quot;What are you freaked out about?&quot;

&quot;Vandemon visited me a few nights ago,&quot; Shinji muttered as she grabbed a 
number of things from shelves and drawers.  &quot;He told me something&#39;s 
happening.  He said it happened four years ago-old enemies are coming 
back for blood.&quot;  Tailmon&#39;s mouth dropped open.

&quot;You mean if they find Hikari?&quot; she murmured.

&quot;They&#39;ll kill her,&quot; Shinji whispered with a nod.  &quot;That&#39;s why I need you 
to find the other Chosen Children.  Find all of them.  Make sure that 
when they find us, they&#39;re at full evolution.  We might need all of 
their help.&quot;

&quot;What can you do on your own?&quot; Tailmon asked.  &quot;You&#39;re just a human!  
You might meet an entire army of evil digimon!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve already killed three digimon for Hikari,&quot; Shinji murmured.  &quot;If I 
have to fight an legion of them for her, I will!  Now go before you 
waste any more time!&quot;  Tailmon did not reply with a nod or words, but 
sprang towards the open window in the room and vanished into the dawning 
dusk.

Shinji didn&#39;t watch her go.  She had barely been paying attention to the 
conversation in any case.  She had been counting the kunai and shuriken 
she was slipping into a leather pouch.  By the time that Tailmon had 
gone, she realized that she had taken all that she had.  For the first 
time, Shinji felt fear simmering inside her.

&quot;There&#39;s a good chance that I might die if I do meet with an army,&quot; she 
whispered to herself.  &quot;But if I don&#39;t try, then Hikari will die.&quot;  She 
took her sword from its stand on the armoire, almost turning away before 
noticing something.  The stand also carried her father&#39;s swords.  One 
was his traditional to blade, and the other was a Japanese kodachi.  She 
stared at them for almost thirty seconds before moving.

----------

Hikari sobbed into her knees, curled tightly in the rising roots of a 
dead-looking tree.  She could barely think in her misery, barely 
remembering to breathe and ignoring where she was.  The Digital World 
around her was blackened, darkened to unending night.  The presence of 
evil and wickedness had contaminated many areas, including the one 
Hikari had unconsciously emerged in with her haste to escape her mother.

&quot;Well, well, well,&quot; an unseen but well-known voice chuckled.  &quot;Would you 
look at that?  A Chosen Child in distress.&quot;  A hand grabbed Hikari&#39;s 
brown hair and pulled sharply.  Hikari let out a cry of pain, grabbing 
uselessly at the hand as she looked to see who was hurting her.  She 
would have gasped, but the sound died halfway in her throat.  
Ladydevimon chuckled, bringing Hikari closer to stare her in the eye.  
Behind her stood creatures that haunted Hikari&#39;s nightmares.

She recognized enemies she and the other Chosen Children had battled 
over the years: Phantomon, Bakemon, Warumonzemon, Woodmon, Etemon, and 
many others.  Even though she still felt despondent, Hikari grew 
terrified.  She didn&#39;t want to be killed.

&quot;And it&#39;s the Light Child, no less!&quot; one of the Bakemon laughed darkly.  
&quot;Isn&#39;t that a great thing for you, Ladydevimon?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yeah!&quot; Etemon roared gleefully.  &quot;She&#39;s been slapped around by that 
angel chick at least twice!  I hear she let a human smack her with a 
piece of wood!&quot;

&quot;Shut your mouth, you ridiculous ape!&quot; Ladydevimon snapped.  She turned 
back to Hikari and grinned, baring her fangs.  She tossed Hikari up by 
her hair and grabbed her by the throat, squeezing tightly and bringing 
the girl close.  &quot;But I can&#39;t deny that I&#39;m sick of that angel bitch of 
yours.  Killing you should put her out of commission for good, don&#39;t you 
think?&quot;  She squeezed even tighter, laughing as Hikari choked.

&quot;Get your fucking *filthy* claws off of my Hikari, you devil bitch!&quot;  A 
flash lit the darkness for a moment; Ladydevimon let out a scream of 
pain as Hikari fell from her hand.  She fell into someone&#39;s waiting arms 
and looked up into Shinji&#39;s blazing blue eyes.

&quot;Get behind me,&quot; the taller woman whispered.  Hikari did as she was 
ordered, peeking out from around Shinji.

&quot;Who&#39;s this one?&quot; Etemon asked with a sneer.  &quot;Never seen this little 
piece of shit before.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the traitor Vandemon&#39;s partner,&quot; Ladydevimon hissed, clutching 
her profusely bleeding right arm.  &quot;The one with the Crest of Dark.&quot;  A 
taunting laugh rose up from the gathered digimon.

&quot;Ooh, the Crest of Dark,&quot; Warumonzemon guffawed.  &quot;I&#39;m so scared!&quot;

&quot;I already cut your head off once, asshole!&quot; Shinji shouted angrily.  
&quot;Don&#39;t think I won&#39;t do it again!&quot;  There was a lowering in the 
laughter, but it did not cease.  Shinji&#39;s eyes narrowed.  She let out a 
sharp breath, which was followed by a sudden scream of pain from 
Ladydevimon.  A shuriken was embedded in her left eye.  Taking the 
moment of shock, Shinji leapt forwards and swung her sword.  
Ladydevimon&#39;s head briefly slid away from her neck before she burst into 
shards of data.

&quot;Who wants to be next?&quot; Shinji murmured, a small smirk on her face.

----------

&quot;In danger?&quot; Yamato asked.  Tailmon nodded, panting for breath.  She had 
leapt, run, and sprung at top speed to Taichi and Yamato&#39;s apartment to 
alert them.

&quot;Yes,&quot; she gasped.  &quot;Hikari ran into the Digital World and Shinji went 
after her.&quot;

&quot;The kunoichi?&quot; Yamato inquired, though in a more curious voice than 
Taichi would have used.  &quot;Vandemon&#39;s partner?&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot; Tailmon said impatiently.  &quot;We don&#39;t have time!  They&#39;re in 
danger right now, and I don&#39;t know if Vandemon is going to realize that 
Shinji&#39;s in the Digital World!  We have to get all the other Chosen 
Children, evolve as much as we can, and help Shinji and Hikari!&quot;  She 
and Yamato looked to the other side of the couch where Taichi had been 
sitting, but he was gone.

&quot;Yamato!&quot; Taichi snapped.  &quot;What&#39;s Takeru&#39;s phone number?  He can 
contact the younger kids while we get the older ones!&quot;  As Yamato jumped 
up to aid Taichi in his calling, Tailmon let out a small sigh of relief 
before Taichi shouted for her to turn on the computer.

----------

&quot;So who&#39;s Shinji?&quot; Inoue Miyako asked as she and Gatomon rode on 
Aquilamon&#39;s back.  Beside them, Taichi and Yamato rode on Wargreymon and 
Metalgarurumon respectively, Ichijouji Ken and Motomiya Daisuke kneeling 
on Imperialdramon&#39;s back, Takeru and Hida Iori holding tight to 
Shakkoumon, Takenouchi Sora and Tachikawa Mimi standing on Garudamon&#39;s 
shoulder as Lilymon flew close by, and Kido Jyou and Izumi Koushiro held 
carefully in Megakabuterimon&#39;s hand with Gomamon in tow.

&quot;She was the ninth Chosen Child eight years ago,&quot; Daisuke called back.  
&quot;Hikari told me that a few months ago!  I&#39;m pretty sure Hikari and 
Shinji are dating!&quot;

&quot;Dating?&quot; Taichi shouted in shock.  &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;There isn&#39;t any time to explain!&quot;  The humans jumped slightly at the 
voice, turning to find Vandemon flying up alongside Wargreymon and 
Taichi.  &quot;Hikari and Shinji are in danger now!  Shinji can&#39;t fight an 
entire army of digimon by herself!  We have to hurry or both of them 
will be killed!&quot;  With the warning, the team redoubled their efforts and 
moved faster towards the black mountain that stood tantalizingly close 
and miles away.

A shout of pain rang out from the mountain followed by someone screaming 
a name.  As digimon came into view, the Chosen Digimon cried out their 
attacks.  The evil digimon fought back as best as they could, but faced 
against the Chosen Children, three Mega digimon, and five Ultimate 
digimon, they had little chance.  They scattered in fear.

&quot;Shinji!&quot; Jyou cried, jumping down from Megakabuterimon&#39;s hand as soon 
as possible.  Hikari was kneeling by Shinji, who looked like she had 
been thrown into the tree.  There were multiple cuts on her body, and 
she was bleeding from her mouth as well.  Jyou gently pushed Hikari away 
to check Shinji over, ignoring the woman&#39;s demands that he make sure 
Hikari was all right.  Taichi took Hikari by the wrist and pulled her 
away.

&quot;Hikari, are you all right?&quot; he asked softly.  &quot;Tailmon didn&#39;t say why 
you were in the Digital World without her, but Daisuke says that you and 
Shinji are dating.  Did something happen back at home?  With Mom?&quot;  
Hikari stared at the ground for a moment before turning and crying in 
her brother&#39;s chest.

&quot;Taichi, I can&#39;t go back home,&quot; she sobbed.  &quot;Mom said I can&#39;t be in her 
home anymore.&quot;  Taichi hugged his sister close, patting her head gently.

&quot;You can stay with me and Yamato,&quot; he murmured.  &quot;OK?&quot;

&quot;I want to be with Shinji,&quot; she said in return.  &quot;I know I haven&#39;t 
asked, but I think she&#39;ll be happy about it.&quot;  Taichi did not get a 
chance to reply to this.  Shinji had shoved them suddenly, a kodachi in 
her bloody hands.

&quot;DARK NETWORK!&quot; Etemon shouted.  He had remained, hiding behind a tree.  
He knew that his attack would not kill the Children of Courage and 
Light, but he wanted to strike at them in any case.  Shinji barely had 
time to lift the sword to stand in a straight guard in front of her.  
The energy hit the blade, paused, and shattered the sword before hitting 
Shinji.  She was lifted off her feet and thrown far, far through the 
air.  Hikari stared, watching as Shinji began to fall far from the 
mountain towards the dark forest below.

Etemon stood laughing at his triumph.  Vandemon did not pause to lash 
back at the digimon but ran and jumped from the mountaintop.  Hikari, 
not seeing or feeling what she was doing, ran to the shards of Shinji&#39;s 
sword, grabbed a piece, and rushed with a scream at Etemon.  She stabbed 
him in the heart, falling to her knees when he burst into data.

Hikari began to sob again, crying until her limbs gave out from 
emotional exhaustion and her body could no longer let loose tears or 
screams.  No one knew what to do.  Taichi knelt by his sister and pulled 
her close.

&quot;He killed her!&quot; she choked out.  &quot;He killed her because she tried to 
save us!  She&#39;s dead!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;ll be all right,&quot; Taichi whispered.  &quot;It&#39;ll be all right, Hikari.&quot;  
He said this without knowing anything.

----------

Hikari spent that weekend sitting on the balcony of Taichi and Yamato&#39;s 
apartment.  She did not eat and slept fitfully during the day.  At 
night, she stared at the moon.  On Sunday night, Taichi begged her to 
eat something, to take an old uniform of his for school the next day.

&quot;Taichi, I don&#39;t want to go to school,&quot; she murmured, her eyes still on 
the moon.  &quot;Please, I don&#39;t want to do anything.&quot;

&quot;Hikari, you can&#39;t keep moping around like this!&quot; Taichi said 
desperately.  &quot;You&#39;ve got to...to do something!  Just because we haven&#39;t 
heard from Shinji doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s dead!  You have to have faith or 
nothing matters!&quot;

&quot;Nothing does matter,&quot; Hikari replied softly.  &quot;Fine.  I&#39;ll go to school 
tomorrow.  Please leave me alone now.&quot;  Taichi opened his mouth, but at 
a loss for what to say, he closed it and walked back inside, sliding the 
door shut behind him.  Inside the apartment, he stood with his hands as 
fists at his sides.  In fury, he let out a growl that carried into a 
yell as he punched a wall.  He stormed into the bedroom, where Yamato 
was sitting on the bed and plucking at his guitar.  Taichi sank down 
next to the blond young man and leaned his head onto Yamato&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;If Shinji does come back, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m going to punch her or 
start liking her a little bit,&quot; the brown-haired man sighed.  &quot;If she 
makes Hikari act like this, then my little sister is really in love with 
her.&quot;

&quot;You think?&quot; Yamato asked sarcastically with a smile.  &quot;Come on, Taichi, 
it&#39;ll be all right.  I don&#39;t think someone like Shinji is going to up 
and die on Hikari like that.&quot;

&quot;Still,&quot; Taichi murmured.  &quot;It just doesn&#39;t seem like she...well, she 
was blasted off of a mountain.  Do you think she has a chance of 
surviving something like that?&quot;

&quot;I do,&quot; the blond man replied.  &quot;She strikes me as the stubborn type.  I 
really think she&#39;ll show up just in time to be dramatic.&quot;  Taichi sighed 
and leaned a bit harder against Yamato.  A smile curved Yamato&#39;s lips, 
but he did not give in just yet.  Taichi let out a low rumble in his 
throat and leaned harder.  Yamato gently put his guitar down and looked 
at Taichi with a bed smile.  Taichi returned the smile and pounced.

----------

The sun rose up in the Digital World.  A digimon, an Adult and the 
Wizardmon that could say he was Tailmon&#39;s friend and comrade, stared up 
at the black mountain.  The night before, he heard the terrible sounds 
of battle.  He had hoped, briefly, that perhaps Tailmon was near the 
melee.  Before he had left the Real World, he had taken a guess and 
supposed that she was the eighth Chosen Digimon.  His only reason for 
thinking this was Tailmon&#39;s strange behavior when she was around the 
humans-how she seemed to calm ever so slightly when she looked at the 
little girl who looked related to the boy Taichi.

It had been such a long time since he had seen his dear friend and 
wished that he could have reached the mountain before the battle ended 
and the same group of digimon that had landed there had vacated.  By the 
time he had even thought to race to the mountain, the digimon and the 
humans had left and vanished once more.  Trying to ignore his 
disappointment, he strode towards the river that began a fourth of the 
way up the black mountain.

Wizardmon, still somewhat depressed, decided to keep his hope of finding 
Tailmon near the mountain.  The best place to begin looking on the 
mountain was the river because its water was clean and bracing and many 
digimon lived there and stayed near there for its ideality of location.  
When he emerged from the black trees, he paused and stared.  A human lay 
on its back on the riverbank, feet drifting limply in the current.  Red 
drained away from the human&#39;s body in the water, but it vanished quickly 
from the minerals in the water.

Wizardmon jumped in shock when memories emerged in his mind.  The girl 
that Tailmon had stared so avidly at in the past had brown hair, just as 
the human-a woman he noticed-did.

It has been so long, he thought.  Perhaps this is Tailmon&#39;s human 
partner.  But she looks like she&#39;s been attacked by other digimon.  He 
walked over to the woman, kneeling down and looking her over.  With a 
start, he heard something come from the woman&#39;s mouth.  Her chest was 
rising and falling very slightly-it was nearly impossible to tell she 
was breathing at all.  She was conscious, of all things.

&quot;What did you say?&quot; Wizardmon asked softly.

&quot;...Hi...ka...ri,&quot; she whispered through blood in her mouth.  Her right 
hand twitched slightly.

&quot;Hikari?&quot; Wizardmon questioned, leaning closer to the human.  &quot;Did you 
say Hikari?  What does that mean?  Is it a person?&quot;

&quot;...Hi...Hi,&quot; the woman coughed, blackening blood splattering from her 
mouth.  She didn&#39;t seem able to speak a full word.  She grimaced, still 
not opening her eyes and coughing weakly.

&quot;She&#39;s dying,&quot; Wizardmon whispered.  He closed his eyes and clasped his 
hands together.  The magic he called up was enough to stop the bleeding 
and restore some of the lost life force, but it was not enough.  Her 
energy, the thing that mattered far more than the blood, was too low to 
support her injured body.  She would die.

&quot;It seems that I owe you my thanks, Wizardmon.&quot;  The wizard digimon 
whirled about, lifting his staff at the voice.  Just as he feared, 
Vandemon was walking towards him and the human.

&quot;For what?&quot; Wizardmon snapped aggressively.  &quot;For giving some blood back 
to this human?  No doubt you&#39;ve brought her back for a meal!&quot;  Vandemon 
frowned but continued to walk towards the human.  &quot;Stay back, Vandemon!  
You will not hurt an innocent human!  You will not hurt a Chosen Child!&quot;

&quot;If it weren&#39;t for the fact that you gave me some time to save her, I 
would have swatted you away by now,&quot; Vandemon murmured.  &quot;I need to 
impart my energy to her or we&#39;ll both die.&quot;  Wizardmon lowered his staff 
slightly, but did not completely drop his guard.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; he asked.  Vandemon chuckled.

&quot;You think she&#39;s the eighth Chosen Child, don&#39;t you?&quot; he questioned.  
&quot;She is a Chosen Child, but she&#39;s the ninth.  I&#39;m her partner.&quot;  
Wizardmon stared at him, utterly confused.  With a frown, Vandemon 
snapped his fingers.  The woman rose up from the ground from Vandemon&#39;s 
magic and floated into his arms.  Wizardmon would have leapt forwards to 
stop Vandemon from whatever he was doing, but halted when he realized 
what was happening.

Vandemon lifted the woman gently, bringing her face close to his and 
closing his eyes.  Wizardmon could almost see the energy flowing from 
Vandemon into the human.  A few moments later, Vandemon opened his eyes 
and smirked at the human.

&quot;You&#39;ll live now,&quot; he said to her.  &quot;I&#39;m sure Hikari will be happy.&quot;

&quot;Hikari?&quot; Wizardmon asked.  &quot;Is that the person she was talking about?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Vandemon replied.  &quot;Hikari&#39;s the eighth Chosen Child.  
Tailmon is her partner.  If you like, when Shinji recovers in two days 
or so, you can come to the Real World and see that little kitty friend 
of yours.&quot;  He turned and smirked at the bemused wizard.  Shinji groaned 
slightly and opened her eyes.

&quot;Ow,&quot; she muttered.  &quot;I&#39;m cold.&quot;  Vandemon laughed aloud.

&quot;You humans are such whiners,&quot; he said.  &quot;Here.&quot;  He let his arms drop 
away from her, concentrating to keep her in the air as he reached over 
his shoulder and took hold of his cape.  He pulled sharply and tore a 
sizable strip from the length of the cape, wrapping it around Shinji&#39;s 
neck and lower face like a scarf.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Shinji murmured tiredly.

----------

&quot;Ah, poor little thing.  Don&#39;t have your girlfriend here to protect you 
today, huh, you bitch?&quot;  Hikari did not turn about, but stopped at the 
boy&#39;s words.  He strolled leisurely around to stand before her, a 
leering smile on his lips.  &quot;Look at me when I&#39;m talking to you!&quot;  He 
slapped her sharply.  Hikari did not respond to the strike.

The boy growled and grabbed the camera around Hikari&#39;s neck, ripping it 
from her.  In a burst of emotion, Hikari remembered that there were 
pictures of Shinji saved on the camera-the only ones she had of Shinji.  
She jumped at the boy, grabbing at her camera desperately.

&quot;Give me that!&quot; she gasped.  &quot;Please, give it back!&quot;  The boy laughed, 
elated at the fire of feeling he had sparked in Hikari.  Tears began to 
stream from Hikari&#39;s eyes.  If she lost the camera, there was nothing 
but her memories of Shinji left for her to revisit.  She didn&#39;t want the 
last traces of the one she loved to be wiped away.  Leaves in a nearby 
tree rustled ominously.  A twig snapped and a foot fell heavily on the 
concrete path Hikari and the boy stood on.

&quot;I don&#39;t care much for honor,&quot; a somewhat muffled voice said.  &quot;But I&#39;ve 
asked you once before why you keep picking on my Hikari, and I won&#39;t ask 
again.  Give her the camera now and I won&#39;t hurt you.&quot;  The boy 
blanched, staring behind Hikari with terror in his eyes.  He shoved the 
camera into Hikari&#39;s hands and stepped away quickly.  He was suddenly 
tackled to the ground.

&quot;Just because I was a little late this time doesn&#39;t mean you can ever 
try and pick on my Hikari,&quot; the person snarled.  &quot;If I ever hear that 
you&#39;ve even looked at her the wrong way, I will break your back like a 
stick.  Do you understand me?&quot;  The boy nodded fervently.  &quot;Good.&quot;  The 
boy received a punch to the forehead and was knocked out.

Hikari stared as the person stood straight and turned about.  Shaggy 
brown hair fell in front of dark blue eyes.  Hikari ran to her and leapt 
into Shinji&#39;s waiting arms, smiling so much that her cheeks stung.
