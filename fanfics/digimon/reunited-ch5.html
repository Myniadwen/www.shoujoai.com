<h1>Reunited: A Tale of Rika and Renamon (part 5 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a>

<a href="../digimon/reunited-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>        &quot;I really hate wearing dresses,&quot; Rika noted, turning slightly in 
her simple black dress. Her red hair was short on top, a long braid 
flowing down her back, and a bit of makeup highlighted her face. The 
glasses she wore were stylish, despite the look on her face as she put 
them on.

        &quot;You look good,&quot; Renamon offered cheerfully. The fox-like 
digimon tilted her head to the side, &quot;So this is all for the debut of 
your new book?&quot;

        Rika nodded, taking her glasses off and putting them in a small 
black purse that she reluctantly carried. &quot;My publisher is holding a 
signing,&quot; she explained, &quot;and a party at one of the major bookstores in 
downtown Tokyo.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m a little confused,&quot; Renamon admitted as they left the 
bedroom together, &quot;why aren&#39;t I disguising myself as a human?&quot;

        &quot;If you want to I can,&quot; Rika smiled up at her, &quot;but my novels 
have a kitsune as a main character. Anyone who sees you there will just 
figure it&#39;s a very good costume.&quot;

        Grandmother looked up with a smile, &quot;Oh, you look lovely. Hold 
still.&quot; With that the gray haired older woman used her digital camera to 
get a photo of the two of them.

        &quot;You could give them a chance to close their mouths, mother,&quot; 
Rika&#39;s Mother shook her head with a wry smile, her redish hair flowing 
around her shoulders.

        &quot;You&#39;re not going to put that up on your webpage, are you?&quot; Rika 
asked her Grandmother only to get a innocent look in return. &quot;I&#39;m 
doomed,&quot; Rika sighed.

        Renamon had to smile slightly at the way this family interacted. 
&#39;My family,&#39; she mused, feeling a gentle warmth inside of her.

        &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re coming along with Rika today,&quot; Mother smiled 
slightly, the normally stylish young woman dressed up even more. &quot;She&#39;s 
never been mobbed at one of these signings, but....&quot;

        &quot;I will protect her,&quot; Renamon vowed softly.

        Grandmother smiled slightly. &quot;I remember when you and Rika told 
me about your leaving for the digital world,&quot; she said, &quot;you made a vow 
to protect Rika with your life.&quot;

        &quot;My knight in gleaming fur,&quot; Rika took Renamon&#39;s arm, leaning 
her head on her shoulder. &quot;You look lovely,&quot; she sighed happily.

        They all heard the sound of a horn off in the distance and 
Mother said, &quot;It looks like your ride&#39;s finally here.&quot;

        The four of them made their way out of the house, stopping in 
surprise at the vehicle that was sitting there. A stretch limo waited 
out in the lane, large enough to seat all of them, the back door held 
open by a familiar figure dressed in a driver&#39;s outfit.

        &quot;Riley?&quot; Grandmother blinked, recognizing the young woman from 
Hypnos. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;Yamaki suggested I keep an eye on things,&quot; Riley smiled, 
pushing her brown hair back casually before pulling the driver&#39;s hat 
back on. &quot;We&#39;re not expecting trouble, but you never know,&quot; she added 
with a shrug.

        Rika laughed, &quot;And you get to go to the signing, right?&quot;

        &quot;Well, yes,&quot; Riley pulled a copy of Rika&#39;s earlier book out of 
her coat, &quot;and I&#39;m buying the new one, too.&quot;

        &quot;Glad to have you along,&quot; Renamon smiled.

        The group filed into the back, a large space with two 
comfortable sets of seats facing each other with a gap to stretch one&#39;s 
legs. Even Renamon was able to sit comfortably in the large space, the 
others looking around eagerly at the various extras.

        &quot;TV,&quot; Mother looked around, &quot;drink bar, snacks, PS2....&quot;

        &quot;They even have internet access,&quot; Grandmother beamed.

        &quot;All the trimmings,&quot; Rika looked around them wryly. She didn&#39;t 
seem too impressed, sitting there casually beside Renamon.

        &quot;At least they both seem happy,&quot; Renamon nodded slightly towards 
the bright eyed Mother and Grandmother.

        &quot;Grandmother will probably post most of this on her 
Livejournal,&quot; Rika admitted, &quot;but I don&#39;t really mind.&quot; She squeezed 
Renamon&#39;s hand gently, &quot;This is going to be a circus, but I hope you&#39;ll 
have some fun, too.&quot;

        &quot;I always have fun with you, Rika,&quot; Renamon smiled gently.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Rika blushed faintly.

        &quot;They certainly are cute together,&quot; Mother murmured softly.

        &quot;You&#39;ve gotten over your misgivings?&quot; Grandmother smiled.

        &quot;It&#39;s hard not to,&quot; Mother noted, watching Rika snuggling up to 
the digimon&#39;s side, &quot;they&#39;re clear about how they feel.&quot;

        Riley&#39;s voice came over the intercom from the driver&#39;s seat, &quot;Do 
you want to go around to the back? There&#39;s quite a mob waiting by the 
doors.&quot;

        &quot;The front,&quot; Rika said with a sigh, &quot;I understand that they even 
set up a red carpet for me, I&#39;d hate to disappoint them.&quot;

        &quot;Then let me get out first,&quot; Renamon offered. She flashed a 
smile at Rika&#39;s questioning look, &quot;I can always clear the way for you.&quot;

        &quot;Yojimbo,&quot; Grandmother murmured to herself. Renamon looked 
confused so she translated, &quot;Bodyguard, more or less.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Rika smiled at Renamon as they coasted to a halt.

        Renamon opened the door, using her impressive strength to push 
the people who were pressing up against it. As she unfolded herself from 
her crouch there was a moment of dead silence, then awed whispers about 
a kitsune.

        Rika emerged next, waving to the crowd of book lovers, then with 
Renamon in the lead the band headed to the front door. &quot;They really like 
you,&quot; Grandmother murmured.

        &quot;Some of it&#39;s because of the controversy,&quot; Rika murmured back, 
&quot;my two female main characters officially became lovers in this latest 
novel.&quot;

        &quot;Welcome,&quot; the manager of the store had a broad smile on his 
face. He took in Renamon and his eyes widened slightly, &quot;That&#39;s a 
marvelous costume.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Renamon nodded gracefully.

        Rika was set up behind a table, posters of her book covers 
arrayed around her and a massive stack of novels beside her. Mom and 
Grandmother went off to explore the store but Renamon stayed by her 
side, drawing admiring glances from the customers.

        &quot;Is it me,&quot; Renamon murmured after a bit as yet another young 
lady clutched her signed novel to her chest, &quot;or are there mostly just 
women here?&quot;

        &quot;Oh yes,&quot; Rika agreed. &quot;The news of our literary avatars coming 
out was picked up by several shoujo-ai websites,&quot; she smiled, &quot;and a 
group of them decided to attend the signing.&quot;

        &quot;And you know this because?&quot; Renamon blinked.

        &quot;My grandmother signs in under an assumed name,&quot; Rika chuckled, 
handing a signed book to a beaming Riley. &quot;Hope you enjoy it,&quot; she 
smiled.

        &quot;Oh, I will,&quot; Riley laughed, moving off and opening the book up 
to the first page.

        The signing went on for hours but a few glares from Renamon 
forced the staff to give Rika fairly regular breaks. Once they ran out 
of books Rika signed a few more older books that fans had brought in, 
then retired to the party.

        &quot;You wouldn&#39;t believe some of the fan speculation about you,&quot; 
Grandmother smirked as they stood in a group, sipping bubbly. She 
smirked, &quot;They&#39;ve also picked up on you and Renamon, or should I say the 
woman in the &#39;Renamon costume&#39;.&quot;

        Renamon looked a bit alarmed at that news and Rika chuckled 
softly. &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; she reassured her, &quot;my publisher is well aware of 
my being a lesbian. I even put it in my author&#39;s description on the 
latest book.&quot;

        &quot;I noticed you stopped using you pseudonym, too,&quot; Mother noted.

        &quot;I don&#39;t feel that I need to hide anything, anymore,&quot; Rika said 
softly, looking up at Renamon with a happy smile. Music started, figures 
moving to dance and Rika asked, &quot;Shall we?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; Renamon lead the smaller woman out onto the dance 
floor, the two of them swaying gently to the slow song.

Author&#39;s Note: I keep intending to end this series, then I get hit with 
ideas for additional chapters. The novels that Rika writes is based on 
my &#39;Kitsune and the Huntress&#39; series of stories. The set up at the 
signing is based on the signing with Nenene in ROD TV Episode one, more 
or less. Hope you like the update, it&#39;ll probably be a few months until 
there&#39;s another one. ^_^;</pre>
