<h1>Reunited: A Tale of Rika and Renamon (part 2 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../digimon/reunited-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Rika had cried out on the first leap, more in honest surprise than 
actual fear. Somehow, she knew she was completely safe in Renamon&#39;s 
arms. They had done this before, in the digital world, but it felt so 
different in the real world, more thrilling somehow. As the wind swept 
by her, she laughed delightedly as she realized it was almost like 
flying.

&quot;You remember the way, right?&quot; it suddenly occurred to Rika to ask 
Renamon. The digimon only snorted softly in amusement.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Renamon said calmly in reply. &quot;I could never forget the 
place I first met my tamer,&quot; she added, her voice filled with emotion.

It took only moments for them to reach the town, then they traveled 
across the rooftops until they dropped almost silently into the 
courtyard of the house. Renamon looked around her, and Rika had to 
smile at the joy on the digimon&#39;s face. &#39;Almost like a soldier coming 
home from the wars,&#39; she thought, and filed the impression away to use 
later.

&quot;Welcome home,&quot; Rika said to her happily, as Renamon, almost 
reluctantly, set her back down on the ground.

&quot;Can we... go inside?&quot; Renamon asked tentatively. Rika didn&#39;t answer 
verbally, the teen just took Renamon&#39;s hand to draw her inside, 
pausing only to slip her shoes off.

Renamon moved unerringly to Rika&#39;s room, looking around with a broad 
smile. The room looked only a little different, only a new television 
and stereo reflecting the passage of years. &quot;It&#39;s good to be back,&quot; 
Renamon sighed.

&quot;There&#39;s something I have to show you,&quot; Rika said a bit nervously. She 
quietly led a confused looking Renamon down the short hallway.

&quot;The spare bedroom?&quot; Renamon said with a little frown.

&quot;Not any more,&quot; Rika said, shaking her head. She led Renamon into her 
office, and walked straight over to the bookcase. She slid down a slim 
volume, the first one in the row, and passed it over to Renamon.

The digimon cradled it in her hands. &quot;The Kitsune and the Huntress&quot; 
was the title, and the cover painting looked oddly familiar to 
Renamon.

&quot;That&#39;s me, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Renamon asked Rika softly. She flipped it open, 
silently reading a few passages to herself.

&quot;I wrote it a few months after you were gone,&quot; Rika said, &quot;at least, I 
wrote the first short story about you then. I was missing you so 
badly,&quot; she said softly, &quot;and I wanted to do something to remind me of 
you.&quot;

Renamon smiled suddenly, &quot;It&#39;s all right, Rika.&quot; She saw the author&#39;s 
name and started to chuckle softly as she asked, &quot;Rena Monica?&quot;

Rika grinned back at her, &quot;It was the first thing I could think of.&quot;



The car pulled in out front, both the passenger side doors opening so 
that Riley and Rika&#39;s grandmother could get out. Yamaki opened his 
door to stand a bit awkwardly by the car, unsure of what exactly to 
say.

&quot;Thank you for the ride,&quot; and to Yamaki&#39;s honest surprise Rika&#39;s 
Grandmother smiled at him as she added, &quot;and for letting us know so 
quickly.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re quite welcome,&quot; he answered with a warm smile.

Riley added, &quot;If Renamon or your family needs anything, let us know.&quot; 
She looked to Yamaki for confirmation, &quot;I&#39;m sure we&#39;d be glad to 
help.&quot; He nodded his agreement.

She nodded in return, walking to her door. She stopped there before 
going in, and quietly said, &quot;You asked Rika to help your organization 
deal with virus Digimon. I suspect if you asked her now, she and 
Renamon might agree.&quot; With that, she walked inside.

Yamaki stood there with his mouth open, looking rather like he had 
just won the lottery. He grinned at Riley, &quot;Let&#39;s go back and give 
Daisy the good news.&quot; They climbed right back into the car and 
hurriedly drove off.

She walked in smiling, stooping to look in the living room and kitchen 
for Rika and Renamon. She went down the hallway, pausing in front of 
Rika&#39;s bedroom to listen carefully. Hearing nothing, she peeked inside 
and felt a bit disappointed when she saw nobody there.



Rika looked over at Renamon, an odd look on her face. &quot;There&#39;s things 
I want to say,&quot; she said to her a little hesitantly, &quot;but I just can&#39;t 
seem to find the right words.&quot;

Renamon put the book down, standing up to step over to Rika&#39;s side as 
she said, &quot;You know you can tell me anything, Rika.&quot;

The young woman blushed redly, shaking her head. &quot;Not this,&quot; Rika said 
softly.

&quot;There may be another way,&quot; Renamon said softly, holding her hand out 
to Rika, &quot;we could bio-merge, become one. Our thoughts would be 
joined.&quot;

Rika didn&#39;t let herself think about it, she just reached out to take 
that hand, her digivice suddenly in her other hand. &quot;Bio-merge, 
Digivolution Activate!&quot; she cried, holding the device to her heart. 
They were engulfed in light as it began.

Rika&#39;s Grandmother pushed open the door hesitantly, not hearing an 
answer to her knock, and gasped softly. &#39;I&#39;ve never seen this before,&#39; 
was the thought that ran through her head.

Rika seemed to fall into Renamon&#39;s body, both of them seemingly 
dissolving together into one figure. Tall, beautiful, she looked noble 
and confident, a golden armored figure standing in the simple, 
ordinary looking office.

Sakuyamon&#39;s eyes widened, she stiffened a bit, then a slow smile 
appeared as the realization ran through her. Ran through both of them, 
really, the single thought of &#39;I love you.&#39;

She heard the sharp intake of breath of Rika&#39;s grandmother, and turned 
to smile to her as reassuringly as possible. &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; 
Sakuyamon said in that lovely double voice, a mix of both Rika&#39;s and 
Renamon&#39;s.

&quot;Incredible,&quot; her Grandmother said in admiration, walking a small 
circle around her. She laughed softly, &quot;Are you going to work this 
into your books as well?&quot;

A quiet laugh was the only reply. Another flash of light appeared in 
the office, and they stood again as two separate figures. Rika held 
Renamon&#39;s hands in her own, looking intently into her eyes. &quot;I said 
this once before,&quot; Rika said softly, &quot;when I lost you. I love you, 
Renamon.&quot;

Renamon reached out, gently brushing Rika&#39;s hair back. &quot;I heard you,&quot; 
she admitted, &quot;and there were times when those words were all that 
sustained me. I love you, too.&quot; She leaned forward, and digimon and 
human kissed lingeringly.

With a little smile on her face, Rika&#39;s Grandmother quietly left the 
two of them alone. They had obviously forgotten she was there, anyway. 
She whistled happily as she walked away. &#39;It may not be easy for 
them,&#39; she thought, &#39;but I&#39;m sure about how they feel.&#39;

She got out her cell-phone and made a very important phone call to 
Rika&#39;s mother. Under the circumstances, she really needed to know 
what&#39;s going on. &quot;Hi, it&#39;s me,&quot; she said softly. Giving her a short 
chance to answer, she said &quot;Renamon&#39;s come home.&quot;

Renamon and Rika came out of the office not long after, a bit red 
faced. &quot;Grandmother,&quot; Rika said softly, &quot;were you still in there when 
we started...&quot;

Her Grandmother just smiled at them broadly, and Rika blushed a bit 
harder.

&quot;We got a bit carried away,&quot; Renamon said a bit apologetically.



Dinner was an interesting experience for them all. Not only did Rika&#39;s 
mother get to see Renamon again, but they decided to drop a bombshell 
as well. They said they were engaged...

&quot;I think they handled it pretty well,&quot; Rika commented to Renamon as 
they walked together to Rika&#39;s room.

&quot;Once they got over the surprise,&quot; Renamon agreed, smiling fondly at 
the simple congratulations they had received from them both.

They walked in, Rika going over to flop down on her bed. Renamon 
stopped at the foot of the bed, kneeling like she had so often before.

Rika sat up in bed, saying to her softly, &quot;Get up here.&quot;

Renamon smiled, tentatively climbing up on the bed beside her. &quot;Sorry, 
old habit,&quot; she explained to Rika softly.

Rika reached over, gently stroking Renamon&#39;s face. &quot;Did you ever 
wonder why I didn&#39;t share a bed with you before, here or when we were 
in the digital world?&quot; she asked. At Renamon&#39;s curious smile she 
softly said &quot;I was tempted, so much so I wasn&#39;t sure if I could have 
held myself back.&quot;

&quot;So was I,&quot; Renamon admitted, &quot;that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t ask.&quot; They cuddled 
there a moment, silently, then Renamon drew back. She pulled something 
from her arm guard, passing it to Rika, &quot;I was given this, before I 
left the digital world.&quot;

It was a Digimon game card, Renamon&#39;s own in fact, reading underneath 
&quot;Shapechanging Sorceress.&quot; She turned it over in her fingers before 
asking, &quot;What is it for?&quot;

&quot;Swipe it,&quot; Renamon said softly in reply.

&quot;Renamon, Shapechanging Sorceress, activate!&quot; Rika said softly, 
swiping the card through her digivice in a single smooth motion.

Renamon&#39;s body glowed brightly in the deepening twilight, then she 
almost seemed to dissolve, the pixels of her form moving and changing. 
They pulled back together, the light fading, and Rika looked at her 
wide eyed.

The blonde haired girl laying beside Rika smiled at her tentatively. 
White arm guards, and a T-shirt covered her top, while orange pants 
and white boots were on the bottom. She looked so different, yet when 
Rika looked into those expressive eyes, she knew it was Renamon beside 
her.

&quot;How do I look?&quot; Renamon asked, her voice the same as it always was.

&quot;Beautiful as ever,&quot; Rika answered, and Renamon smiled at that. They 
pulled together for another kiss, then Renamon reached out to turn off 
the light.



Author&#39;s Notes: Renamon&#39;s human form is based on a fan-art I saw of 
her a while back, while Renamon&#39;s card came from information I got on 
www.shoujoai.com&#39;s forums. Finished at last! I had originally 
considered doing a series, but got badly blocked writing this section, 
so it&#39;s not very likely I&#39;ll continue it. Of course, if enough people 
ask...

I do hope you liked this story, and read my other series. </pre>
