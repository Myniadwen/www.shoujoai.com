<h1>Perfect Day</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a>

<pre>	&lt;There she stumbles
	Falling to her knees
	I think she tripped on reality&gt;

It was a pleasant summer day that everything started to fall apart.
Fate always picks the days that you can&#39;t help but remember with
crystal clear clarity...

The way the air was just slightly warm, the azure above was flawless
and the smell of summer blossoms was heavy on the breeze. Perfect. It
was an absolutely perfect day.

The sound of people chattering as I walked through the park... I was on
my way home from work. Who&#39;d have imagined I&#39;d ever end up in an office
position... well, I know I never thought that would happen.

But the sights and the sounds, they were all so memorable. And then,
above it all, through it all like a leak breaking through a crack in
the wall, I heard my name.

I remember pausing, looking around the park. A multitude of people that
I didn&#39;t recognise hummed and moved around me. So where had it come
from? Why had I heard my name?

A slight tug at the back of my sleeve made me turn, and I gasped.
&quot;Sora?&quot; I asked softly, stunned at the young woman who stood before me.
Her cheeks were soaked with tears, and now that I listened I could hear
the people who commented on the mess of a woman who was crying out her
eyes...

&quot;What happened? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; I need to know, Sora. Please let me
know.

She trembled and wiped at her eyes; without a word I got my
handkerchief from my purse and dabbled at the runny make-up on her
face.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; I urged her on.

Her lips just opened and closed around nothingness, and then she spoke
Mimi&#39;s name, and I think it all started to fall into place.

&quot;Come on, my apartment isn&#39;t far from here,&quot; I told her, and then I
started to lead her back. I wanted to give her some sort of
semblance... I wanted to give her some help...

I wanted to know why the hell this had to happen to Sora... she&#39;s a
nicer person than I&#39;ve ever been. She doesn&#39;t deserve this kind of
treatment... she doesn&#39;t deserve this type of pain...

	&lt;I have witnessed
	Tragic comedies
	That&#39;s the world in which she leads&gt;

So that&#39;s where I am now. Sora&#39;s seated at the kitchen counter, and I&#39;m
making her a drink. She hasn&#39;t spoken again, and I just wish she would.
So I turn and move towards her, setting it down on the counter.

&quot;Here you go,&quot; I say with a smile.

She tries to echo the movement, but it fails, and she claims the glass
with pale hands.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I shouldn&#39;t have... I shouldn&#39;t have bothered you.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not a bother, Sora,&quot; I admonish her, &quot;I&#39;ve known you since I was
eight. This is the least I can do for you.&quot;

She smiles half-heartedly. &quot;You were always too wise.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not being wise,&quot; I murmur, &quot;I&#39;m... just being me.&quot;

&quot;What happened?&quot; I ask.

&quot;I-I don&#39;t know. It just blew up. Mi-Mimi had been obsessing on
Yamato&#39;s musical career and-and she just... I don&#39;t know what
happened...&quot;

I set my hand on her own, and give a reassuring squeeze. &quot;You don&#39;t
have to go into depth if you don&#39;t want to, Sora.&quot;

Her smile is shaky. &quot;You&#39;re too nice, Hikari.&quot;

Her life is tragic. She has her good days, and she has her bad. She...
just deserves better than what fate has dumped on her shoulders...

	&lt;Well I would walk a million miles
	To give her all that she needs
	But she would walk a million more
	To do what she believes&gt;

Maybe I just like knowing that I have something to do. And if helping
her with my friendship is the only way that I can, then I&#39;ll do it. I
want her to be happiness...

I know that I will do anything.

Whatever she wants of me... she just needs to ask.

I&#39;ll be seeing her after work this evening. We&#39;re going out to dinner.
Ever found yourself having to sort out feelings?

Praying you&#39;re not taking advantage of a friend when she&#39;s down...

Neither have I. Not until Sora came back into my life, that is...

But she&#39;s pushing herself so far... to be able to stand on her own two
feet without anyone&#39;s help. The breakup is harder than I could
imagine... and it&#39;s hard just to imagine.

Because I&#39;ve never been with someone.

I&#39;ve always been happier just knowing that... they were all right...

I don&#39;t know if I feel that way anymore. And I&#39;m not even sure how I
should react to that...

	&lt;She&#39;ll have a perfect day&gt;

The Keeper of Love once told me that love itself is a thorn covered
rose. Yes, I&#39;m talking about Sora now.

Well, I don&#39;t know. Maybe she&#39;s just had a bad time with it...

I look at her across the table at the cafe where we&#39;re having lunch.
I&#39;ve never told her how much I love the time we spend together.

I love being with her...

If I was sure of it, I&#39;d think I loved *her*. But I don&#39;t think she
wants to hear that... that&#39;s not &#39;all right&#39;. So I&#39;ll live with it. If
anything, I&#39;ve become very good with holding in my emotions.

	&lt;Troubles blooming
	Innocence now fades
	But still she&#39;s dry through
	All the rain&gt;

&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; I ask her, and she looks across the
table towards me. Her eyes are so deep and clear... I love the way the
light up... when she first came out, they were so empty and dull.

&quot;Nothing much. How long has it been?&quot;

It... I know what &#39;it&#39; is. &quot;Three months now.&quot;

She nods slightly and looks down at her drink. There&#39;s a slow smile on
her face. &quot;I think it&#39;s time that I actually moved on. Just let go and
moved on. What do you think?&quot;

I nod approvingly. I only want her happiness.

&quot;Thank you, Hikari. You always understand...&quot;

So she wants to move on... but with who? She&#39;s going to leave me again,
isn&#39;t she? I&#39;ve gotten so used to her being in my life... what am I
supposed to do if she leaves me alone?

It starts raining outside, the water pounding onto the sidewalks.

	&lt;There&#39;s no purpose
	She has yet to crave
	She&#39;s like the big dog on parade&gt;

If she doesn&#39;t think she has a purpose, then I feel just the same. Am I
supposed to cheer her on as she goes out and tries to live her life?

I don&#39;t want to, but I know that I will. I&#39;ll do anything and
everything for the sake of her happiness. Even if it&#39;s tearing out my
heart and soul and shredding them piece by piece...

I was happy when Takeru and Daisuke were together. Even though I hadn&#39;t
expected that at all. I&#39;m sure I was more than just a bit... put out.

But I was happy for them... it&#39;s been years and the hurt has faded. So
I&#39;m still happy for them...

But Sora... Sora... I don&#39;t know if I can just be happy for her. No, I
know I can. I need to rephrase that. I don&#39;t know if just being happy
for her is going to be killing me with every breath that I take...

But is there anything that she really craves?

The way that I crave to be her only reason for happiness...?

	&lt;Well I would walk a million miles
	To give her all that she needs
	She would walk a million more
	To do well as she pleased&gt;

Another week, another day. It all blends together and it just doesn&#39;t
make sense anymore. My life has become divided. Sora, and work.

It&#39;s better that way.

But she&#39;s living her life. Even if it&#39;s killing me slowly. But why
should I complain? If Sora is happy, then that&#39;s all that matters.

It&#39;s all that matters.

I look up from the couch at the sound of a knock at the door. Who could
it be? It&#39;s late at night, and no one should be on the prowl...

Knowing my luck, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s my landlord come to kick me out of the
building.

But it&#39;s not. It&#39;s Sora, looking disheveled, holding a single rose in
her hand. She looks up at me, and offers me the blossom. &quot;Hikari...&quot;

&quot;Sora...&quot;

I grasp the blossom. It&#39;s been de-thorned... for some reason that feels
important. &quot;Come in...&quot;

She does, and I close the door. We end up standing there, just looking
at each other. She takes the initiative to speak first.

&quot;Hikari?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; I ask, putting the rose into the vase on the hallway table.
Looking back to her, I wish I could fathom what I&#39;m seeing in her
eyes...

She&#39;s so hard to read...

	&lt;She had a perfect day&gt;

&quot;I think I need to aplogise...&quot; she murmurs.

Wait, that makes no sense. Why should she be apologising...?

I stare blankly at her, and then with an abrupt motion she brings her
hand up to caress my cheek. God, that warmth sends tingles of sensation
down my spine, &quot;Sora...&quot; I breathe her name heavily.

&quot;I&#39;m not oblivious to matters of the heart, Hikari. Sometimes I just
choose not to see them. I-I&#39;m sorry I did that to you.&quot;

I blink, and her hand abruptly pulls away. &quot;Sora...?&quot;

She moves forwards, wrapping me in her arms. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry. I was
heartless and I know that I&#39;ve been hurting you. Could you please
forgive me?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; My heart is pounding so heavily in my ears. I can hardly hear
her or my self at that. &quot;Sora...&quot;

&quot;Hikari, please... no, if you can&#39;t... I guess that&#39;s all right... I
deserve what ever you want to give me.&quot;

She puts me at arms length, her eyes deep and sad. &quot;I can go if you
want me to.&quot;

My response is a kiss that knocks her back onto the couch. I&#39;m
breathing heavily above her, tears in my eyes. &quot;You can&#39;t leave me. You
*can&#39;t* leave me, Sora!&quot;

I lean to kiss her again, and she just bends and folds under the touch.
She has such sweet lips. Like rose petals. Or cherry blossoms... I love
the feel of her lips beneath my own...

&quot;Don&#39;t leave me...&quot; I whisper when I reluctantly break off the kiss,
caressing my hands across her cheeks. &quot;I love you. You can&#39;t leave me.&quot;

I don&#39;t want to be alone. I&#39;ve always been afraid of being alone...
please, Sora, please...

She links her arms around my shoulders and pulls me back to her,
kissing me, telling me with actions what don&#39;t need to be said with
words. Clothing becomes something that&#39;s not important at all as she
shows me more of those same actions...

The perfect night turns into another perfect day...

And it&#39;s not the last because that just started our life together.

	&lt;I can&#39;t figure this one out
	I&#39;ve no words here to explain
	She&#39;ll just sugar kiss me off
	She&#39;ll just have another perfect day&gt;
