<h1>Kidan (part 1 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/9thchild.html">Shinji Shazaki</a><br> </h2>
<pre>There were times when Yagami Hikari wished she&#39;d stop wearing things 
about her neck.  First there was the whistle and the pink scarf, which 
could not escape teasing.  Taichi managed to teach Hikari how to ignore 
the jeers from the other eight-year-old children.  After the Digital 
World, Hikari gave away both the whistle and the small scarf.  The 
whistle was given to her dear friend and digimon partner, Tailmon.  The 
scarf, though, Hikari never planned to see again.

During her time in the Digital World, Hikari had fallen dreadfully ill 
and was nearly killed by rampaging digimon looking for her and the other 
Chosen Children.  To her fortune, someone had rather foolhardily slipped 
into the building the girl had been hiding in when Takenouchi Sora and 
Takaishi Takeru ran outside to greet Taichi and Izumi Koushiro.  Just 
before the building was set aflame, Hikari, barely conscious, had been 
carried out of the building.

When she next awoke, Hikari found herself lying on concrete, the sound 
of water rushing all around her.  Still weary from illness, she looked 
about and was shocked to see dark blue eyes watching her.  Shazaki 
Shinji had rescued her, and not but three minutes after Hikari&#39;s waking, 
saved the younger girl&#39;s life again.  A very peculiar digimon by the 
name of Warumonzemon had attacked them in hopes of pleasing his master 
Machinedramon.

It was then that Hikari began to understand why Shinji never smiled.  In 
a blur, Shinji stood, drew her straight ninja to, and rushed the Viral 
bear creature.  The human cut through the digimon, dancing around his 
attacks with indolent ease.  With his options limited to death or death, 
Warumonzemon had turned about and slammed his paw into the ground.

The resulting eruption of concrete lifted Hikari from the ground and 
threw her into a nearby underground river.  Shinji sliced off the bear&#39;s 
head, sheathed the sword, and dove into the river after Hikari.  She 
managed to catch up with the smaller girl, grabbing her round the middle 
with one arm and grabbing at the side of the river with her free hand.

Her hand caught a jutting pipe, but it was rusting away and would not 
hold them for very long with the rushing water pulling them.  Despite 
the water&#39;s strength and her own weariness-she later confessed to Hikari 
that she had not slept in five days, as she was wont to-Shinji did not 
let go of Hikari.  Just as the pipe was about to break, a flash of red 
light whipped out of the shadows and wrapped around Shinji&#39;s left wrist. 
 Automatically, the hand released the pipe and Shinji and Hikari were 
dragged back onto the solid ground.

Vandemon&#39;s &quot;rescue&quot; saved both of them, but tore into Shinji&#39;s wrist.  
It bled slowly, the veins scorched shut from the heat of the energy.  
Hikari consequentially took the soaked scarf from her neck and carefully 
tied it around Shinji&#39;s wrist.  Shinji did not smile, but thanked 
Hikari, her eyes a bit kinder than Hikari had seen them before.

It had been eight years since Hikari&#39;s first soir&eacute;e into the Digital 
World.  Four years after the first excursion, she, Takeru, Motomiya 
Daisuke, Hida Iori, Inoue Miyako, and Ichijouji Ken battled in the 
Digital World to defeat a corrupted copy of Vandemon&#39;s programming.  
Hikari found herself hoping that, because Vandemon was involved, his 
partner would appear.  She did not emerge from her departure.

Eight years after the first battle for Earth, Hikari began to wish she 
had stopped wearing things on her neck.  At the time, she had started 
her third year of high school and chose to take part in a photography 
class.  She wore a small digital camera around her neck and took 
exquisite pictures when she found them.  Not everyone was thrilled with 
her hobby.  A few boys in their final year at the school took to 
taunting Hikari about the camera and why she carried it everywhere.

Though she tried desperately to ignore the boys, Hikari realized that 
she was no longer eight years old, and neither were the taunting boys.  
The tactics that Taichi had taught her were not up to the challenge of 
daily mockery and the occasional game of throwing Hikari&#39;s camera about 
dangerously.

It was one day such as this that Hikari received a surprise.

----------

&quot;What d&#39;you need this stupid hunk-o-junk for?&quot; the largest of the boys 
questioned, harsh laughter in his voice.  &quot;Come on, my grandma has 
better tech than this crap!&quot;  Hikari would have informed the boy that 
jokes involving a person&#39;s grandmother were quite old and ineffective, 
but she was a bit too concerned with praying that they wouldn&#39;t drop her 
camera.  The ground was covered in grass, but it was still warm from the 
end of summer and the ground beneath the grass was hard.

&quot;Aw, does the little baby girl need her camera back?&quot; the second of the 
three boys cackled.  &quot;Maybe she&#39;s got some hot photos of her and her 
boyfriend Takeru on here!&quot;  Hikari felt no embarrassment from the 
remark.  She and Takeru had never become anything more than good 
friends, and neither wanted it to grow past that.

&quot;Or maybe she&#39;s got some kinky shit with her, Takeru, and Daisuke!&quot; the 
third boy guffawed.  &quot;That&#39;s probably why she&#39;s so desperate!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m trying to get it back because I need my camera!&quot; Hikari snapped in 
reply.  &quot;Give me it back!&quot;  The first boy caught the camera once more, 
twirling it menacingly on his index finger by the strap.

&quot;Fat chance, Yagami!&quot; he said with a sneer.  &quot;You&#39;re not getting this 
back in a million years!&quot;

&quot;I need it for my class!&quot; Hikari protested.  &quot;Please, I need it back!&quot;  
The three boys continued to laugh at Hikari&#39;s pleas and her hopeless 
attempts at grabbing it from the leader&#39;s hand.  The boy hopped 
backwards from her, still twirling the camera, and jumped right into 
someone standing behind him.  He whirled and bared his teeth at the 
person.

&quot;Give me the camera,&quot; the person, a young woman, murmured.  &quot;Hand it 
over now and I won&#39;t break your nose.&quot;  Hikari paused, her eyes widened 
in shock at the woman&#39;s voice.  She could barely remember the voice she 
heard, but it did strike a chord in her mind.

&quot;Go to hell, bitch!&quot; the boy shouted.

&quot;Fine, your nose,&quot; the woman replied.  &quot;Not my problem.&quot;  In a 
heartbeat, the boy let out a shout of pain as the woman&#39;s palm crashed 
into his nose.  It cracked immediately and began to bleed heavily.  The 
camera flew up from his hand, but the woman snatched it easily.

The two other boys looked at the woman once before grabbing their leader 
and dragging him off, shouting curses and threats over their shoulders 
as they ran.  The woman watched them go, her blue eyes rather detached.  
She turned and walked to where Hikari stood stunned.

&quot;I heard him say Yagami, and I wondered if it was that same little 
Yagami Hikari girl who gave me this scarf,&quot; she said, still not smiling. 
 &quot;From the look of it, I&#39;d have to say you&#39;re still the same girl, but 
not little anymore.  Here.&quot;  She put the camera in Hikari&#39;s hands and 
turned to leave.  &quot;You had better hurry to your school or you&#39;ll be 
late.&quot;  She turned and started away.  A pink scarf was tied around her 
left wrist.  Hikari paused for only a moment before hurrying up to the 
woman.

&quot;Shinji?&quot; she questioned.  &quot;By the gods, is that you?  It&#39;s been eight 
years since I&#39;ve seen you!  How are you?&quot;  Shinji paused and looked at 
the girl.

&quot;Alive,&quot; she said with a faint shrug.  &quot;Looking for a steady job.  You?&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve seen you,&quot; Hikari answered with a 
smile.  &quot;Where do I even start?&quot;  Shinji raised a brow at her.

&quot;I have a feeling that this might take a while,&quot; she muttered.  &quot;Come 
on.  You can have some tea with me.&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;m already late for school,&quot; Hikari protested.  &quot;Should I meet you 
somewhere later?&quot;  Shinji shrugged at her.

&quot;If we don&#39;t talk now, I&#39;ll probably forget after looking for a shop 
today,&quot; she said.  &quot;You can come with me, if you like.&quot;  Hikari looked 
at the ground, considering what Shinji said.  When she did not reply, 
Shinji turned again and started away.

&quot;I guess one day off won&#39;t be too terrible,&quot; Hikari said quickly, taking 
a step to catch Shinji by the hand.  &quot;Where should we go?&quot;  Shinji&#39;s 
lips twitched for a moment and her frown lessened.

&quot;My house should be fine,&quot; she responded.  &quot;Come on.&quot;

----------

Hikari couldn&#39;t help but smile.  It had been a very long time since she 
had ridden with someone on their bike.  She had her arms around Shinji&#39;s 
waist as the other young woman pedaled steadily towards their 
destination.  People barely gave them a second glance as they passed, 
even though Hikari was wearing her uniform.

Some time later, they had crossed over the Rainbow Bridge, passed the 
Tokyo Tower, and went by the Prime Minister&#39;s residence.  Shinji stopped 
in front of a traditionally built two-story home and waited for Hikari 
to slide off the bike.  She wheeled the bike to the single tree by the 
right side of the house and locked it to the tree before returning to 
Hikari.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you live in such a nice house,&quot; Hikari murmured 
appraisingly.  &quot;And such a nice neighborhood.&quot;

&quot;You thought I lived in a garbage heap?&quot; Shinji teased, her eyes showing 
the smile her face hid.  Hikari laughed and shook her head as Shinji 
unlocked the door and led her inside.  What struck Hikari as strange was 
that Shinji did not call her arrival, nor were there any slippers for 
more than two people.

&quot;Shinji, do you live alone?&quot; she questioned.

&quot;For eight years now,&quot; Shinji replied, leading Hikari to the dining room 
off the kitchen.  &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve been living alone since the Digital World?&quot; Hikari inquired.  &quot;I 
don&#39;t understand.  You couldn&#39;t have been older than twelve back then.&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t,&quot; Shinji answered.  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t let them put me in a foster 
home, and I don&#39;t have any relatives.&quot;

&quot;Why would you need a foster home?  What happened to your parents?&quot;

&quot;You never wondered why I killed Piemon?&quot;

&quot;I thought...you didn&#39;t care about rescuing me?&quot;

&quot;That was half of it.  The other half I don&#39;t even understand.&quot;  Shinji 
sank into a chair and stared at her right hand.  &quot;The night before we 
all went into the Digital World, Piemon appeared to ask Vandemon what 
the hell he was doing, sending all the digimon back.  He entered this 
world there-&quot; She pointed towards another room with her left hand.  
&quot;-And killed my mother and father.  I know that most people would go 
after their parents&#39; murderer to avenge them, but I didn&#39;t.

&quot;I hated my parents, and I still hate them to this very day.  I don&#39;t 
know why I hate them so much, and I don&#39;t know why I killed Piemon.  
Maybe it was because he did what I never could and killed my parents.  I 
don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever know any of those things.&quot;  Her right hand closed 
into a tight, shaking fist, her blue eyes narrowing in rage and hatred.

Hikari&#39;s hand slid onto Shinji&#39;s, holding it gently as she wrapped her 
other arm around Shinji in a hug.  She ran her hand over Shinji&#39;s hair 
soothingly, the young woman&#39;s head on her shoulder.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry you had to go through that,&quot; Hikari said softly.  &quot;That you 
had to live alone and try to know why you did what you did.  And I&#39;m 
sorry that I was such a poor friend.  I never even tried to contact 
you-not to tell you we could get into the Digital World or anything.  I 
never even made sure you were still *alive* after we came back eight 
years ago.&quot;  Her breath hitched suddenly, and Shinji could feel the 
other girl&#39;s hands shaking.

&quot;I can remember it so clearly,&quot; Hikari whispered shakily.  &quot;Piemon had 
me by the...the throat and you ran up behind him and you stabbed 
him...then he stabbed you in the stomach...and you were bleeding so 
much...I was so scared that you were going to die.&quot;  She let out a sob, 
throwing her arms around Shinji&#39;s neck and trembling against her.  &quot;I&#39;m 
so sorry!&quot;  It was a long time that Hikari cried against Shinji&#39;s 
shoulder.

&quot;No one ever said that to me,&quot; Shinji said suddenly.  &quot;It was always 
that they were sorry my parents were murdered.  You&#39;re the first person 
to apologize like that to me.  Thank you, Hikari.  Come on, stop 
crying.&quot;  She lifted her left hand and dabbed at Hikari&#39;s eyes with the 
pink scarf around her wrist.  Hikari moved away, her eyes still shining 
a bit.  To her surprise, Shinji gave her the faintest of smiles.

&quot;I&#39;m fine, Hikari,&quot; the young woman murmured.  &quot;I&#39;m not angry.  You&#39;re 
here to catch up with me and have a cup of tea, not cry because I wanted 
to be alone.&quot;  Hikari sniffed and nodded, smiling at the brown-haired 
woman.  Shinji stood up and pushed Hikari to sit in a chair while she 
walked into the adjoining kitchen.

&quot;Green tea?&quot; she questioned.

&quot;Yes, please,&quot; Hikari answered.  As she dried her eyes, the water heated 
and Shinji brought them both a mug.

&quot;Didn&#39;t you say something about getting into the Digital World again?&quot; 
Shinji asked.  &quot;I suppose that strange old man was wrong about the 
Digital World being closed forever, wasn&#39;t he?&quot;  Hikari laughed at the 
comment.

&quot;He never reads every part of his prophecies,&quot; she replied.  &quot;He skipped 
over the part about the other Chosen Children and Vandemon being copied 
into a human&#39;s mind for evil.&quot;

&quot;Say that again?&quot;

&quot;Oh, about four years ago, Takeru and I met with four other Chosen 
Children.  One of them was trying to take over the Digital World because 
he was upset about his brother&#39;s death, but he was really just a pawn of 
two digimon created by a copy of Vandemon&#39;s programming that had 
possessed a man named Oikawa Yukio.&quot;

&quot;Why do I have a strange feeling that Piemon was behind making a copy of 
Vandemon&#39;s program?&quot;

&quot;Because you&#39;re right.  I think he wanted to make sure he had a Vandemon 
that would listen to everything he demanded.  There&#39;s really so much to 
tell you.&quot;

&quot;Then start at the beginning.&quot;

----------

&quot;So that&#39;s why my digivice was reacting that night.&quot;

&quot;Good to know we had one more point of light against Belialvandemon.  I 
was actually a little worried we wouldn&#39;t beat him.&quot;  Shinji gave her a 
small smirk.

&quot;It&#39;s destiny, remember?&quot; she said.  &quot;Even if the odds seem impossible, 
we&#39;ll always win.&quot;

&quot;You know, I kind of hoped that you would show up when we started going 
into the Digital World again,&quot; Hikari murmured.  She was blushing and 
fiddling with her thumbs, a smile on her pink face.  &quot;I, um, I wanted 
to-to thank you for saving my life...three times.&quot;  Shinji blinked at 
her in slight surprise.  &quot;Well, I never did get to thank you for it 
before, and I hoped that because we were all getting involved with the 
Digital World, you might appear and I&#39;d get to thank you.  So, thank you 
very much.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Shinji replied, though still a tad bemused.  &quot;I don&#39;t 
think I&#39;ve ever had a pretty girl thank me for helping her before.&quot;

&quot;How many pretty girls have you rescued?&quot; Hikari questioned, not quite 
picking up on the remark.

&quot;Just you.&quot;  Hikari blushed crimson at the reply, even as a somewhat 
pleased smile appeared on her face.

&quot;I, ah, thank you again,&quot; she said, stuttering in her astonishment.  
&quot;Listen, you know how I told you that there are millions of Chosen 
Children all over the planet?  All of us-except you-have their digimon 
partners living with them.  If you&#39;d like, you can come with me to the 
Digital World and we can find Vandemon.&quot;

&quot;That might have to wait for another day,&quot; Shinji replied.  &quot;It&#39;s seven 
eighteen.&quot;  Hikari jumped in her chair, gasping as she saw the clock.

&quot;Oh my god!&quot; she squeaked.  &quot;I missed school!  I missed dinner!  Tailmon 
and Taichi are probably looking for me now!  My mother is going to kill 
me!&quot;

&quot;I suppose I should have stopped you when I started cooking that beef 
ramen at six,&quot; Shinji said rather thoughtfully.  &quot;I&#39;m glad you liked 
it.&quot;  She smirked a bit at Hikari&#39;s frantic mutterings.  &quot;I&#39;ll give you 
a ride back to your home.&quot;

&quot;You will?&quot; Hikari asked rapturously.  &quot;Oh, thank you!  I&#39;d never get 
home before my mother made Taichi search with Greymon!&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t he a giant fire-breathing dinosaur?&quot; Shinji inquired as they 
quickly exited the house and got back onto Shinji&#39;s bike.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Hikari answered simply.  Shinji raised her eyebrows before 
quickly pushing off and pedaling back towards Odaiba.

----------

&quot;Tailmon, this is just weird,&quot; Taichi grumbled.  &quot;I called Daisuke and 
Miyako when my mom called me that Hikari wasn&#39;t home by five, but they 
said they didn&#39;t see her at school today.  It&#39;s almost seven thirty.  
Hikari&#39;s never out this late!&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Tailmon replied shortly.  &quot;We better find her soon, or your 
mom is going to make you get Greymon out here.  Does your digivice say 
anything?&quot;  Taichi lifted his digivice up, squinting at it in the 
flickering light of the streetlamp.

&quot;Hey, there are two signals coming this way!&quot; he said with a 
cheese-eating grin.  &quot;Coming up quick from...that way!&quot;  He pointed down 
the sidewalk.

&quot;Bike!&quot; Tailmon shouted suddenly.

&quot;What does that mean?&quot; Taichi demanded.

&quot;Look out for the bike!&quot; Tailmon cried, jumping to the side.  Taichi 
looked up to see a bike and its two riders speeding towards him and 
jumped aside just in time.

&quot;Sorry, Taichi!&quot; a somewhat unfamiliar voice shouted, fading as the bike 
sped off.

&quot;I&#39;ll see you at home, Taichi!&quot; Hikari&#39;s voice cried as well.  Taichi 
and Tailmon shared a glance before tearing after the bike.  They arrived 
at the Odaiba Mansion apartments and the Yagami apartment, panting and a 
smidgen angry with the person Hikari had been riding with.

&quot;I&#39;m terribly sorry, Mrs. Yagami,&quot; the same unfamiliar voice as before 
was speaking when the two arrived at the apartment.  &quot;I found Hikari 
when she was leaving school, and we haven&#39;t seen each other in eight 
years.  We were catching up with each other at my house, and we just 
lost track of time.  If there&#39;s any blame to be dealt, I should be the 
one to get the full hand, not Hikari.&quot;

&quot;I can understand that, but who in the world are you?&quot; the matriarch of 
the Yagami family asked.

&quot;Shazaki Shinji,&quot; the person replied, bowing at the waist as Taichi and 
Tailmon shuffled around the corner to look into the large, main room.  
When they straightened, Taichi jumped in shock.

&quot;The kunoichi!&quot; he gasped.  &quot;What on earth are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;Delivering your sister to her home, safe and sound,&quot; Shinji answered.  
&quot;And you, Taichi?  Isn&#39;t twenty a little old to be living in your 
parents&#39; apartment?&quot;

&quot;I live in my own apartment,&quot; Taichi replied tersely.  &quot;You almost ran 
us over!&quot;

&quot;I was trying to get Hikari home,&quot; Shinji replied.  &quot;At least, before 
you and your dinosaur started to terrorize Tokyo.&quot;  Taichi frowned at 
her, but before he could snap back, Hikari stepped forwards and gathered 
one of Shinji&#39;s hands into her own.

&quot;It was wonderful to see you again,&quot; the sixteen-year-old girl said with 
a bright smile.  &quot;Don&#39;t go hiding for another eight years.  Here.&quot;  
Shinji realized that Hikari had pressed a piece of paper into her hand.  
&quot;Call me and we&#39;ll go to the Digital World sometime.&quot;  Shinji gave her a 
small smile and nodded.

&quot;Mrs. Yagami, Taichi,&quot; she said, bowing to the two.  She turned to 
Hikari; her slight smile returning as she bowed gracefully at the waist 
and briefly took the girl&#39;s hand in her long fingers.  &quot;Hikari.  Thank 
you for this afternoon.  I&#39;ll see you soon.&quot;  She bowed again and left 
without a sound.  Hikari smiled after her before apologizing profusely 
to her mother, thanking Taichi for searching for her, and walking to her 
room with Tailmon.

&quot;Hikari, Taichi said that your friends didn&#39;t see you at school!&quot; 
Tailmon protested once Hikari shut the door.  &quot;Why did that girl say you 
were at school when you weren&#39;t?&quot;  Hikari did not reply.  Instead, she 
quickly walked to the balcony door and slipped outside.  She leaned on 
the edge of the balcony and looked down to the street many stories 
below.

Hikari saw Shinji walk out of the building, recognizing the blue shirt 
and black jeans the young woman had been wearing.  She watched as the 
brown-haired woman got on her bike and pedaled away into the dark night. 
 Without realizing it, Hikari let out a content sigh as she watched 
Shinji ride away.

&quot;Hikari?&quot; Tailmon questioned.  &quot;Why are you smiling so much?  Hikari?&quot;  
Hikari, however, did not exactly reply instantly.

&quot;I&#39;m glad I got to see Shinji again,&quot; she answered.  &quot;It&#39;s nice to see 
her smile.&quot;

&quot;Why is it so great?&quot; Tailmon asked somewhat bitterly.  She had never 
particularly enjoyed Shinji in any way due to her disdain of Shinji&#39;s 
partner, Vandemon.

&quot;I like seeing her smile,&quot; Hikari replied.  &quot;I like making her smile.&quot;  
Tailmon, though she did not have eyebrows, raised a brow in minor 
question.  She leapt up and landed gracefully on the ledge next to her 
partner and best friend.

&quot;You know, Hikari, I&#39;ve seen some people smile like you&#39;re smiling right 
now,&quot; the cat digimon murmured.  &quot;Not a lot of people, but I know what 
they&#39;re smiling about.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Hikari asked rather dreamily, staring off vaguely at the 
place where Shinji had vanished from sight.

&quot;I see Taichi smiling like that when he talks about Yamato,&quot; Tailmon 
responded with a faint purr of her own.  &quot;I see your mother smiling at 
your father like that sometimes.  I even see Ken smiling at Daisuke like 
that.&quot;

&quot;Like what?&quot; Hikari queried, still smiling.  Tailmon, despite her 
carrying opposition to Shinji, smirked at Hikari&#39;s lack of 
comprehension.  She jumped down to the balcony and walked to the glass 
door.

&quot;Like you&#39;re in love,&quot; the white cat purred as she slipped inside.  
Hikari blinked, emerging from her trance at Tailmon&#39;s words.  She turned 
to look in question at the cat, but Tailmon had slid the door shut by 
the time she turned.  The girl leaned against the wall of the balcony, 
staring at nothing and wondering about Tailmon&#39;s words.  After a time, 
she turned around and looked up at the moon, still wondering.

----------

Shinji stopped beside the tree, locking the bike to said tree before 
climbing up the large plant and leaping onto the roof of her house.  She 
lay on her back and looked up to the crescent moon.  A moment later, she 
looked at the folded paper still in her hand.  A faint smile quirked her 
lips in the gleaming moonlight.
