<a href="../digimon/darkguard-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>        &quot;Angel,&quot; Renamon murmured, crouched down on the rooftop, 
making herself as small of a target as possible.

        The tall blonde stood there with a deceptive kind of 
casualness, looking almost as if she was merely out on a summer&#39;s 
walk. But instead they were locked in mortal combat, two assassins 
trying to determine who might be the best.

        &quot;You&#39;ve gone soft,&quot; Angel murmured, &quot;soft and stupid.&quot;

        &quot;Try that attack again,&quot; Renamon answered her coolly, &quot;and see 
how slow I am.&quot;

        Angel&#39;s smile appeared suddenly, then it was gone as she leapt 
up to the attack, her short sword gleaming in the near darkness. 
Renamon went up and over her, unleashing a storm of diamond shaped 
blades, but Angel managed to roll clear. Barely.

        &quot;Maybe you haven&#39;t gone soft,&quot; Angel admitted as she reached 
up to wipe a bit of blood from a cut on her cheek.

        &quot;Being attacked regularly does help keep one sharp,&quot; Renamon 
commented, speaking as one professional to another.

        &quot;I won&#39;t insult you by offering the opportunity to return to 
the guild again,&quot; Angel stood up straight, holding her sword in the 
ready position.

        &quot;Good,&quot; Renamon stood as well, meeting the woman&#39;s unspoken 
challenge. &quot;And I won&#39;t insult you by asking if you want to give up,&quot; 
she said with a certain amount of regret, &quot;I know that you have vowed 
to finish the assignment.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Angel nodded formally. They stood there a few 
moments, &quot;I suppose there&#39;s only one thing left to do.&quot;

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Renamon agreed.

        They moved almost as one, running right at each other. The 
blades gleamed in Renamon&#39;s hands, a light matched by the steadily 
held sword of Angel. Their path&#39;s crossed, there was a flash of light, 
then they both swiftly came to a stop.

        Renamon swayed, dropping to her knees as she hissed in pain, 
bringing her hand to her side. It came away bloody, the fur matted and 
sticky with gore.

        Angel looked up at the sky a moment, the moon shining above. 
&quot;It&#39;s beautiful,&quot; she sighed. She turned to Renamon and tried to 
smile, &quot;Well struck...&quot; It was almost as if the last of her strength 
fled at that moment, her body falling limply from the rooftop, stone 
dead.

        &#39;A guild apprentice will come to retrieve the body,&#39; Renamon 
thought grimly as she forced herself to her unsteady feet, &#39;I have my 
own problems to deal with.&#39;

        Renamon managed to make her way across the rooftops silently 
even with her wound. She soon found herself on Rika&#39;s balcony, tapping 
gently on the window in the code that she and Rika had agreed upon 
weeks before.

        &quot;Renamon, I was waiting for..&quot; Rika flung open the window, 
only to stop in alarm. &quot;You&#39;re hurt!&quot; she cried out.

        &quot;Wasn&#39;t quite fast enough,&quot; Renamon tried to make light of it.

        &quot;Come on inside,&quot; Rika quickly got herself under Renamon&#39;s arm 
and helped support her weight as they both went inside. &quot;The cut 
doesn&#39;t look too deep,&quot; she murmured as she helped Renamon sit on the 
bedside.

        &quot;Just painful and messy,&quot; Renamon acknowledged. &#39;I just hope 
that Angel hasn&#39;t taken to poisoning her blade,&#39; she thought.

        Rika&#39;s face paled, &quot;Poison?!&quot;

        Renamon looked up at her in surprise before saying, &quot;The mind 
link strikes once again.&quot; More gently she added, &quot;It&#39;s not likely, 
Rika. Angel was never one to use poison, she felt it was dishonorable. 
I doubt she&#39;d change her mind just because she was coming after us.&quot;

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Rika smiled, carefully examining the wound. &quot;It&#39;s 
hard to see with the fur in the way,&quot; she said softly.

        Renamon&#39;s body shimmered in the darkness, shrinking slightly 
as she changed form. &quot;Is this better?&quot; the fully human Renamon asked.

        &quot;Ick,&quot; Rika made a face at the now clearly visible wound, a 
long but shallow cut in Renamon&#39;s side. Gathering up some bandages she 
carefully cleaned the wound with a cloth dampened in a basin of night 
chilled water

        Renamon hissed softly, &quot;Cold!&quot;

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Rika smiled slightly, thinking back to the time at 
the mountain spring. Once she was sure the wound was clean she began 
to bandage, carefully wrapping the bands of cloth around Renamon&#39;s 
ribs. &quot;All done,&quot; Rika sat back with a smile.

        Renamon smiled as she levered herself up to a sitting 
position, &quot;Thank you very much.&quot;

        Rika blushed suddenly, realizing that she had been tending to 
an entirely nude young woman. &quot;I&#39;ll get you a shirt,&quot; she blurted as 
she turned away.

        Renamon looked confused, then her eyes widened slightly, &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry, Rika,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;ll return to my kitsune form.&quot;

        &quot;No,&quot; Rika said forcefully, &quot;you might rip the bandages.&quot;

        Renamon had to nod, &quot;A good point.&quot; More softly, &quot;I don&#39;t know 
if I will ever understand human&#39;s attitudes about clothing.&quot;

        Rika surprised her with a laugh, &quot;I don&#39;t know that I always 
do, either.&quot; She rummaged around her closet a bit before coming up 
with a bundle of cloth which she handed to Renamon, &quot;This was a bit 
too long form me, but I think it might fit you.&quot;

        Renamon shook it out cautiously, revealing a long old 
fashioned night gown. &quot;Pink?&quot; she made a face at the bright color.

        &quot;And what&#39;s wrong with pink?&quot; a smirking Rika asked, knowing 
full well that she hadn&#39;t worn that color in a great many years.

        Renamon gave her a disapproving look, then sighed softly. She 
slipped it on rather uncomfortably, nearly getting tangled up before 
finally getting it on. &quot;How do I look?&quot; the pink clad Renamon asked 
cheerfully.

        Rika took one look at her and broke out laughing.

        &quot;That&#39;s about what I thought,&quot; Renamon agreed. She walked over 
to the bed and sat down beside Rika, waiting until the laughter died 
down.

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Rika wiped at her eyes, &quot;it just so does not suit 
you.&quot; She shook her head, &quot;I suspect you would be the boxers and 
night-shirt type.&quot;

        Renamon nodded slightly, &quot;Perhaps I should try that, then.&quot;

        Without intending to, Rika yawned mightily. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she 
blushed.

        Renamon looked out the window, &quot;It&#39;s at best only past 
midnight, you should try to get back to sleep.&quot; She looked away a bit 
nervously, &quot;If you wish, I can stay with you like this.&quot;

        Rika blushed brighter, &quot;Please.&quot;

        Renamon let Rika settled down first, then she slipped into bed 
behind the younger girl. She felt Rika stiffen and softly asked, &quot;Are 
you all right?&quot;

        &quot;This will just take some getting used to,&quot; Rika softly 
answered. They snuggled there together, and after some time passed 
they fell sound asleep.
