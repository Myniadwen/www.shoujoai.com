<h1>A Night at Home</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/patty.html">patty</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Where was Sora? The girl should have been home hours ago and she 
didn&#39;t even call. She was hoping to spend some time with her before 
finals started next week. Between studying and working and taking 
classes, the pair had almost no time left for themselves.  

She wondered if something was wrong with the train and that was why 
Sora was not home yet. She knew for a fact that the trains in Japan 
were horrible at rush hour. She rolled around and faced Sora&#39;s side of 
the bed and she could almost smell that fresh, musk scent she carried. 
She just hoped that Sora would be home soon.

~*~

Human biology was the most awful subject she ever had to take. For one 
it was hard, and the teacher didn&#39;t make it easy with all the surprise 
quizzes and papers she constantly handed out. She quickly answered the 
last question, scribbling away furiously, and handed to paper to her 
Professor. 

She went straight to her locker to pick up a few books she would need 
for the weekend and headed outside to hail a cab. She knew that Mimi 
was waiting for her and she didn&#39;t even call her. She knew Mimi was 
probably worried. 

It was just her luck when police officers stopped her cab from riding 
across the bridge. There was an accident up ahead because of the rain 
and no one was allowed passage. This meant that her driver had to back 
up, and head in the opposite direction not to mention around the back 
way of the bridge to get to the other side. That took another hour. 
She knew for a fact that Mimi would be worried and probably calling 
friends to see where she was.

When she finally did reach her building hours later, she quickly ran 
upstairs to greet Mimi. 

Once inside the apartment, she called Mimi&#39;s name but got no answer. 
Could it be that she decided to go out at such a late time? She went 
into the kitchen to get herself a glass of water that she drank down 
quickly, made her way into their bedroom and beheld the beautiful 
sight of Mimi sleeping. The covers were draped over her lower body and 
her back was exposed. She noticed the beautiful arch in her soft back, 
and the creamy skin. She licked her lips.

She sat down next to her, on Mimi&#39;s side of the bed, and ran fingers 
through Mimi&#39;s soft hair. She was a sight to look at even when she was 
sleeping. Leaning forward she planted kisses on her lover&#39;s neck and 
upper back. Mimi&#39;s chocolate, brown eyes fluttered open and an &quot;Mmm&quot; 
sound escaped her lips.

&quot;You&#39;re home,&quot; she whispered.

&quot;I am,&quot; Sora replied as she continued with her kisses.

&quot;I was waiting for you.&quot;

&quot;I know. I&#39;m sorry. I had a surprise exam to take. Kept me back a 
while.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay. You&#39;re here now.&quot;  

Sora carefully pulled down the rest of the sheet so that Mimi&#39;s 
buttocks were fully revealed to her. She licked her lips at the sight 
and covered them with her wet lips, kissing the left and right one 
before squeezing them.

&quot;Turn around,&quot; she said. &quot;I want to see your beautiful face.&quot; Mimi 
listened to Sora&#39;s wishes, eager for her to continue. As soon as she 
did, Sora made sure to press her lips on Mimi&#39;s. She soon pulled off 
her shirt, sneakers. She would have taken off everything else too if 
she wasn&#39;t captured by Mimi&#39;s beauty. 

She straddled her hips and started covering every sensitive spot she 
knew Mimi possessed. She started with soft, arousing kisses to Mimi&#39;s 
shoulders and she then traveled to her neck and back to her lips. She 
claimed Mimi&#39;s breast in her mouth, sucking on an erect nipple until 
Mimi moaned her name and sighed. Only then did she give the other the 
same treatment, coating it with saliva and gently nipping at it. 

&quot;Again,&quot; Mimi moaned when she thought Sora would stop so soon. She 
listened and did exactly what Mimi said. She sucked hard on the nipple 
and pulled on it all the while squeezing and massaging the other one. 
Mimi sat up, wrapped her arms around Sora and pressed her chest into 
the other woman&#39;s. Then playfully squeezed Sora&#39;s small breasts, but 
Sora motioned for her to lay back down and let her do all the work 
tonight. She quickly disposed of her jeans and undergarments. 

She loved the way Mimi&#39;s bellybutton looked with a piercing. It was 
too sexy and she hoped that maybe Mimi could get another one. Of 
course Mimi didn&#39;t need such a thing to enhance her looks. She was 
perfect in every way to Sora, and her body was absolutely gorgeous 
with or without clothing. 

She made her way lower to the most sensitive spot that she knew would 
arouse her lover completely with one touch. When she did Mimi moaned 
her name, &quot;Sora,&quot; and raised her hips off the bed for more. Sora 
complied with her signal and started massaging the wetness until Mimi 
was groaning, raising her hips off the bed, begging Sora for more. 
Sora complied and stroked the delicate spot faster.

Removing her hand made Mimi want to scream and plead Sora to pleasure 
her in every possible way. All senses where amplified with Sora&#39;s 
teasing and the room was red, on fire. But Sora just licked her 
fingers and grinned devilishly at her. Mimi spread her legs further 
apart to show Sora what she needed her to do.

&quot;I will, my sweet,&quot; she said before she teased the area where the 
inner folds met with her tongue. 

&quot;Sora,&#133;.&quot; Before she could say anymore, she received exactly what she 
wanted. Sora always knew what felt incredible to Mimi and when she 
finally started, Mimi was going to die in ecstasy. Sora pressed her 
tongue in a bit and swirled it around slightly before sucking hard on 
the swollen bud and then using her fingers to fondle the sensitive 
area. Mimi raised her hips up again to feel that shocking sensation 
course through her body again because every touch and caress was 
pleasurable. Sora always had such an effect on her. 

Sora&#39;s tongue lapping at her womanly juices felt good, but she wanted 
more. She needed that sensitive place to be fondled again. So she 
pointed to show Sora what had to be done. Sora looked up a bit and 
grinned naughtily before burying her head once again between the sweet 
legs. She loved the small gasps and moans that she made escape Mimi&#39;s 
lips, so much that she worked faster to pleasure Mimi more than 
before, giving in to her girlfriend&#39;s pleas until she was lost in the 
moment and could only suck and move her head up and down with Mimi&#39;s 
out-of-control hips.

She stopped again, and a passionate growl escaped Mimi&#39;s pink lips. 
Sora was not sure if it meant she was enjoying herself or if she was 
just angry that she stopped. Placing a finger between Mimi&#39;s legs, she 
worked fervently at toying with the mound of her sex. She slid in that 
finger all the way and wiggled it around until Mimi threw her head 
back and groaned. She added a second finger and gave her the same 
treatment as with the one finger all the while nipping at a nipple. 
She wanted to pleasure Mimi to the fullest and of course she was 
enjoying herself as well. She loved the way her fingers disappeared 
inside Mimi&#39;s body and reappeared when she pulled them back out. 

Keeping one hand to continue toying with Mimi, she brought the other 
fingers up to Mimi&#39;s mouth.

&quot;Taste it.&quot; Mimi held the hand in both of hers and sucked the fingers.

&quot;It&#39;s good, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Mimi didn&#146;t answer, she just moaned.

As Sora nuzzled against Mimi&#39;s foot, she knew that it was over and a 
groan escape her lover&#39;s lips. She slid upwards, against the trembling 
skin until she could easily kiss the lips beneath hers. She did so 
until Mimi realized what was happening and wrapped her arms and legs 
around Sora. She planted her lips on Sora&#39;s neck while Sora did the 
same for her and sucked on the moist, candy tasting skin. 

&quot;Kiss my lips again,&quot; Mimi whispered in Sora&#39;s ear.  

Sora did so and pressed lips against lips only for Mimi to deepen 
their kiss.

Sora rolled over so that she was next to her lover. She snuggled 
against Mimi&#39;s breasts since she liked their soft fluffiness and it 
was always comfortable. She felt Mimi&#39;s hand running through her hair 
and wrapped an arm around her waist.

&quot;What about you?&#148;

&quot;Don&#146;t worry about me. I enjoyed myself as well.&quot; There was a brief 
silence while they kissed once more,&quot; wait until finals are over. 
We&#39;ll spend our vacation like this.&quot; She looked up at Mimi when she 
got no response and saw the she was already asleep, exhausted. She 
pulled the covers up over them both and followed her lover into 
peaceful slumber&#133;
