<a href="../digimon/kithunt-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Early the next morning Renamon walked with Rika to the
edge of the forest, and when she stopped they stood
there a moment to quietly talk. &#147;Thank you, for what
you said to me yesterday,&#148; Renamon said to Rika
softly. A shaft of sunlight broke through the thick
branches, illuminating Renamon and making her fur seem
to glitter gold.

&#147;You were awfully quiet after I said it,&#148; Rika said.
She smiled shyly up at Renamon as she admitted, &#147;I was
a bit worried I offended you, or something.&#148;

Renamon placed her hand on Rika&#146;s shoulder to smile at
her gently. As she looked down at her, Renamon
realized that the bone thin girl she had met more than
a year ago was almost gone. Rika loked healthy and
well, her red hair had grown out a bit, tied back into
a long ponytail. She had flesh on her bones, her arms
grown muscled and strong from helping Renamon with her
tasks. But it was the eyes that showed the greatest
change in her. The anger that had once seemed to fill
them was gone, and they seemed much more at peace.

&#147;No,&#148; a quiet Renamon said, shaking her head firmly,
&#147;I just didn&#146;t know what to say.&#148; She smiled slightly
before admitting, &#147;I still don&#146;t.&#148; Renamon looked
deeply into Rika&#146;s eyes, unsure of what she was trying
to look for. &#147;I will miss you, Rika,&#148; Renamon
whispered.

&#147;And I you,&#148; Rika said, her voice choked and a single
tear gleaming at the corner of her eye. With a careful
caress by a single finger Renamon lightly brushed it
away, and then she silently disappeared into the
safety of the forest.

Rika stood there for a minute or two and watched her
go, wishing that she had been able to say something
more. Then with a small, soft sigh she turned around
to follow the path to the house that she had left so
very long ago.

&#145;I don&#146;t think of it as my home anymore,&#146; Rika came to
that realization a little sadly, &#145;Renamon&#146;s den is
home to me now.; She sadly shook her head, more than a
bit worried. &#145;And if Renamon grows tired of me, what
will I do then?&#146; Rika wondered.

Over the past few months, Rika had slowly felt
something new growing deep inside of her, a powerful
emotion. Beyond the simple gratitude that she had felt
at first, Rika had begun to feel love for the remote
and intense kitsune. But she didn&#146;t know how Renamon
felt about her.

Rika looked up and with a faint blush realized she had
walked right by the house, she was so lost in her
thoughts. Rika was just a little surprised, when she
finally saw it. The roof was repaired, the spring
garden around it alive with green, and the newly
painted walls shone in the morning&#146;s light. The only
out of place thing was a slight stain of dark red on
the bottom of the front door. She raised her hand,
hesitated, then knocked on it firmly.

The door opened up and Rika found herself looking into
her Mother&#146;s suddenly bone pale face. &#147;Rika?&#148; she
whispered softly in pure disbelief. Then with a happy
shout she threw her arms around the taller girl as she
cried, &#147;Rika! You&#146;re back! Oh, where have you been?&#148;

Rika held her weeping mother in her arms, gently
patting her on the back and trying to reassure the
sobbing woman as much as she could manage. As her
Grandmothger came out to join them Rika was also a bit
surprised to see how much taller she was than both her
Mother and Grandmother were.

&#145;I guess it must be because of Renamon&#146;s care,&#146; Rika
thought to herself with a little smile, &#145;all the good
food and exercise I&#146;ve gotten.&#146;

Her Grandmother smiled up at her, and extended her
slighly shaking arms for a hug, too. Rika&#146;s Mom set
her free, so she moved into her Grandmother&#146;s
comfortable embrace. She held Rika close, then
repeated her daughter&#146;s question: &#147;Where have you
been?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ve been living with the kitsune of the forest,&#148;
Rika answered them a short time later, sitting in a
comfy chair and sipping a big cup of tea in front of
the blazing hearthfire. With a odd feeling of sadness,
she suddenly realized that she&#146;d much rather be
sitting on the bed with Renamon drinking a hot mug of
her soup instead.

&#147;With the kitsune? But why?!&#148; Rika&#146;s mother asked her
worriedly, wringing her long apron between her two
hands.

&#147;Because of a promise that I had made to her,&#148; Rika
said, intentionally not mentioning Renamon&#39;s offer to
free her from that vow. With a few interruptions for
questions from her frantic Mother, Rika told the tale
of that winter&#146;s hunt. &#147;Renamon, the kitsune, has
taken good care of me ever since then and I think has
kept her part of the bargain, as well,&#148; she said as
she saw her Grandmother&#146;s thoughtful expression.

Rika&#146;s Grandmother nodded her head in agreement, &#147;The
fresh kills, every morning and evening. That must have
been her, then.&#148;

&#147;Could she be holding you captive, using some kind of
spell or enchantment?&#148; Rika&#146;s mother asked with a
frown.

Rika shook her head, firmly. &#147;Why let me come back
here at all, then? If I was under some kind of
enchantment, I doubt I would even want to.&#148;

&#147;This kitsune, Renamon,&#148; Rika&#146;s Grandmother asked her
curiously as she saw the look on Rika&#146;s face &#147;what is
she like?&#148;

Rika&#146;s eyes shone with happiness as she talked, her
face lighting up as she told them of her and Renamon&#146;s
time together, the many adventures they had shared and
always about how she cared about her. Her Grandmother
listened to Rika quietly, and her smile slowly grew.
Later that evening, Rika&#146;s mother and Grandmother
talked softly after she went to bed.

&#147;What do you think?&#148; her Mother asked her Grandmother
worriedly. She still suspected some dark enchantment
held her daughter, but she wasn&#146;t sure.

Grandmother smiled ruefully , &#147;If she&#146;s under a spell,
it&#146;s only one of love. Prepare yourself for a kitsune
daughter-in-law, daughter.&#148;

Mother&#146;s eyes widened. &#147;You don&#146;t mean she&#146;s a...&#148;

&#147;Of course,&#148; Grandmother answered, giving her daughter
a &#145;my, you&#146;re dumb&#146; look. &#147;It seems to me you have
only two choices; you can accept this, and hopefully
gain a kitsune daughter, or fight it and likely loose
Rika.&#148;

Mother looked like she was fighting an difficult inner
battle, then she slumped with a small sigh, &#147;It was a
lot easier when I was younger.&#148; She pointedly ignored
Grandmother&#146;s quiet snort of amusement at that.

Early the next morning, Grandmother drew Rika aside
and asked her, &#147;Have you told your Renamon about how
you feel about her?&#148;

&quot;What,&quot; Rika squeaked out, looking over at her in
surprise.

Grandmother decided to take that as a no. &#147;From what
you said, you care for her a great deal,&#148; she said to
Rika leadingly, and waited for a response.

Rika just nodded quickly, a flaming blush appearing on
her face. &#147;I do love her,&#148; Rika said nervously, &#147;but I
don&#146;t know how she feels about me.&#148;

&#147;Well, there&#146;s only one way for you to find that out,&#148;
her Grandmother said to Rika with an encouraging
smile.

&#147;I don&#146;t think I approve of this,&#148; Rika&#146;s Mother said
firmly and then she suddenly smiled to Rika wryly.
&#147;But I do wish you well. Bring her over here one day,
I&#146;d like to meet this Renamon,&#148; she said with a small
smile on her face.

Later that morning Rika left the hut carrying a
satchel full of breads and cheeses under her arm and
walked briskly back towards the safety of her forest
home. The sun was shining above her, the flowers were
coming into bloom and Rika felt secure in knowing
exactly where she most wanted to be.

Renamon there stood anxiously waiting at the edge of
the wood and smiled in honest relief as she saw Rika
finally approaching. As soon as Rika saw Renamon
waiting there she broke into a run and then jumped
right up into the surprised looking Renamon&#146;s
welcoming arms.

Renamon held her fiercely close, twirling her about
happily. Rika looked up and was surprised to see tears
at the corners of the kitsune&#39;s eyes. &#147;Oh, Rika! I
feared you would not be allowed to return to me,&#148;
Renamon admitted a bit tearfully. Rika reached up to
gently wipe at her eyes, she hadn&#146;t understood before
now how much her leaving had worried Renamon.

&#147;Thank you for letting me go,&#148; Rika said, actually
crying a bit herself. She then grinned at Renamon, &#147;I
come bearing gifts! Bread and cheese.&#148;

Renamon smiled a bit, &#147;Cheese is one of the few things
I miss, living in the forest with you.&#148; She paused a
bit, &#147;Rika, are you... staying?&#148;

Rika wrapped her arms around Renamon&#146;s neck and broke
into tears against her shoulder. Renamon looked very
discomforted, and Rika couldn&#146;t resist the urge to
laugh through the tears. &#147;I think,&#148; Rika said, smiling
up at the mildly stunned looking Renamon, &#147;I had to
see where I had been, before I could decide to go
forward.&#148;

Renamon looked hopefully into Rika&#146;s eyes, and gently
hugged her more firmly. &#147;Forward, with me?&#148; Renamon
asked her tentatively.

A grinning Rika nodded to her happily. &#147;I love you,
Renamon,&#148; Rika cried out joyfully, and then she kissed
her.

They drew back, and a broadly smiling Renamon said &#147;I
love you too, Rika.&#148; She chuckled a bit, softly, and
Rika gave her a odd look. &#147;I just could never say it,&#148;
she admitted. She pulled Rika in to another sweet
kiss.

They stood there together, holding each other close.
Rika smiled a bit as she pressed her cheek to
Renamon&#146;s own softly furred one. &#147;My mother wants to
meet you,&#148; she said softly, and waited for the likely
response.

&#147;What?!&#148; Renamon replied, and for the first time since
they met, the kitsune looked honestly afraid of
something. Or in this case someone.

Rika couldn&#146;t help it. She just laughed.

The End

Author&#146;s Notes:

The basic idea for this came from various sources,
including quite a bit of &#145;Beauty and the Beast&#146;. I was
also inspired, or irritated, by stories where the hero
or heroine falls in love with a magical creature, but
then ultimately chooses to return to their boring
normal life. That always struck me as a bit unfair to
the poor magical character who fell in love with them,
so I decided to write something in that style with a
more happy ending.

So why did I pair up Rika and Renamon? Well, their
relationship in Digimon series three has always seemed
to be a little different, compared to the other
digimon and their tamers. They start out more like
allies than actual friends, only growing closer over
time, not unlike how a real world couple would develop
their relationship.

At one point, Rika says to Renamon: &#147;What really
impresses me is how heroic you look, standing in the
moonlight,&#148; and in the original Japanese version she
actually comments on how strong and beautiful Renamon
is. She may not have intended anything romantic in
that but it certainly implies something....

Later on in the season when Renamon first meets Rika&#146;s
Grandmother, she kneels down and then pledges to her
&#147;I&#146;ll protect her with my life.&#148; More like a knight in
armor than a digimon. Very much to Rika&#146;s great
surprise!

Of course, after seeing how they ended season three, I
was hopping mad, literally! Rika actually told Renamon
that she loves her right before Renamon got sucked
back into the digital world! Grrrr! I was also pretty
irritated by the totally gratuitous attempt to pair
Rika up with Rio, despite her obvious dislike for the
guy!

I tried to work in a mention of Renamon&#146;s digivolved
forms without messing up the fantasy plotline too much
and I&#146;m not quite sure if it works. I though about
having Renamon giving Rika a magic charm (aka
digivice) to help the transformations but decided that
it would be way too hokey even for me. I will probably
contine to tinker with that bit...

I&#39;ve done my second set of revisions and rewritten a
bit more, added a few paragraphs here and there and
tried adding some more description. Rika now has a
reason to go home other than pure homesickness, and
I&#146;ve spelled out Renamon&#146;s job a bit more. The
homecoming is also a bit longer, and I&#146;ve tried to
clarify the growing romance between them.

Yet another Mercedes Lackey reference! Go through all
my stories and collect them all! Laughs. The &#145;wild
lands&#146; was inspired by the &#145;uncleansed lands&#146; in the
Mage Winds trilogy (Winds of Fate, Change and Fury).
Renamon serves a similar role to the Tayledras from
the novels, working to clean up the magical equivalent
of toxic waste, as well as protecting any innocent
bystanders who wander in there.</pre>
