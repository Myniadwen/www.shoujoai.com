<a href="../digimon/jetiendo-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>A week later the school trip 

At the hospital May and Ash just recovered their bleeding. At the 
bedside of Max whom had the terminal shock of watching people had their 
brains blown out? Max was crawled up in a ball sudden shakes and asthma 
attacks. 

Instead of comforting Max who was the main reason why they went there 
they stared delightfully at each other. Then someone came through the 
door a sexy woman in black and perfect skin marched in 

&quot;So &quot; the woman sneered, &quot;you are the sweet couple who got injured in 
that school trip&quot; 

&quot; Yeah&quot; Ash replied 

Then the woman took an interest to on to Ash &quot; Is your name Ash 
Ketchum?&quot; 

&quot; Yeah it is&quot; Ash answered, &quot; Why ask?&quot; 

&quot; I&#39;m princess Angelica&quot; she sneered, &quot; the kings sister, I know your 
mother. You do have her eyes and your father&#39;s raven hair. I haven&#39;t 
seen your parents in ages are they well?&quot; 

&quot;My mom&#39;s fine but unfortunately my dad&#39;s dead&quot; 

&quot; What a shame&quot; hissed Angelica &quot; I was looking forward to a little 
reunion&quot; 

Then Shyst who all covered in blood outside called every one to come 
they all rushed as if it was a fire alarm. &quot; I hope we meet again,&quot; 
Angelica hissed to Ash as she walked away. 

&quot; Shyst&quot; Tasha announced, &quot;What do you want? What brings you here? Are 
you alright?&quot; 

&quot; The monastary attack,&quot; Shyst gasped &quot; all the monks. All off them 
killed for no reason the traitor of our clergy 

&quot; What traitor?&quot; Tasha asked 

&quot; Sister Arui&quot; Shyst gasped, &quot; She turned into a vicious woman and 
terrorised us all corrupting the war&quot; 

&quot; Don&#39;t worry Shyst&quot; Tasha comforted &quot; if we all wish for her harm, her 
suffering, pleasure her humiliation we are no different to her. We must 
forgive them all they are also the sufferers as well as us&quot; 

&quot; Them&quot; Davis snapped &quot; the sufferers. Aruikenimon nearly destroyed the 
digital world she is a nasty bicth how in any way your majesty is she 
suffering?&quot; 

While Tasha replied to Davis&#39;s question May and Ash had something else 
on their minds Angelica what was she doing? 

&quot; What do you think of that Angelica?&quot; Ash asked May as they entered 
Max&#39;s room 

&quot; I don&#39;t trust her,&quot; May replied then louder she said,&quot; I don&#39;t trust 
her at all&quot; 

&quot; She just recognised me&quot; Ash hissed &quot; but I don&#39;t know her she said she 
knew my family&quot; 

&quot; You know when she heard that your father&#39;s dead and she replied a 
little reunion&#39;&quot; May asked 

&quot; Yeah&quot; 

&quot; Maybe she&#39;s an ex&quot; 

&quot; What do mean by an ex?&quot; 

&quot; Like she used to love your father,&quot; May replied &quot; but they split up&quot; 

&quot; I guess you&#39;re right &quot; Ash replied, &quot; there isn&#39;t any other solution 
she&#39;s trying to get back at my mom I hope she ain&#39;t ...&quot; 

&quot;Ain&#39;t what?&quot; 

&quot; Coming on to me&quot; Ash replied 

&quot; Oh no &quot; May replied &quot; we are in danger the future isn&#39;t looking 
bright&quot; 

&quot; Pika pikachu pi, pi Chu (for god sake you have each other me, Brock 
and Max) pika Chu pi, pi, pi pikachu ka (I don&#39;t give a shit what that 
tart wants I&#39;ll shock her to death)&quot; 

&quot; Pikachu&quot; Ash demanded, &quot; don&#39;t swear&quot; 

Pikachu with a big smile stuck his middle finger up at Ash. 

Meanwhile Angelica searched for someone who she needed talking to. 

&quot; Delia&quot; she thought &quot; I will find you we need a major chat&quot; 

Then she spotted Delia Ash&#39;s mother &quot;ha here you are Delia&quot; 

&quot; Well Delia Ketchum&quot; Angelica smiled like a friend &quot; ex sister-in-law&quot; 

Delia turned around 

&quot;Angelica&quot; Delia snarled at her &quot; what do you want?&quot; 

&quot; Well I&#39;ve met Ash today he is very nice&quot; Angelica said to Delia as if 
she was a friend 

&quot; How dare you&quot; spat Delia &quot; you&#39;re worst than Rage&quot; 

&quot; I just want to see my jolly nephew&quot; Angelica smirked 

&quot; You bicth&quot; barked Delia 

&quot; A bicth I am?&quot; Angelica whispered, &quot; I think you are the bicth in this 
situation. Why did you lie to the prince Ash about his father the 
current king&quot; 

&quot; To keep him away from the likes of you and that brother&quot; Delia hissed 

&quot; You&#39;ve done quite well&quot; smiled Angelica &quot; for 14 years,&quot; 

&quot; Aunt Angelica&quot; Tasha called 

Angelica took an evil smile at Delia 

&quot; My niece calls me. It will only be sooner or later that Ash will name 
me Aunt Angelica&quot; Angelica smiled &quot; you will get your comeuppance you&#39;ll 
be in history&#39;s most villainous women&quot; 

&quot; You go less than a hundred feet away from my son I&#39;ll kill you,&quot; 
snapped Delia 

&quot; I&#39;d love to see you try&quot; Angelica hissed with pride as she marched 
around the hospital looking for her niece. 

&quot; Tasha&quot; Angelica smiled in her respectful face &quot; Zelda, Marth&quot; Angelica 
acted respectful to Zelda and Marth who where siblings to Cleanses. 
Tasha&#39;s mother who died in child-birth eighteen hours since then Rage 
the king only married twice once to Delia that lasted a year .the third 
was Ila his current wife who had been cheated loads of times and forgave 

&quot; Mother&quot; &quot; Mom&quot; 

Garnet and Roy who where Angelica&#39;s sons ran to her Angelica with her 
family made an evil smile at Delia at the distance. 

Max was seriously not getting better. As in his ball shaped body he shot 
out and became a complete maniac vomiting, asthma, a fit rolling around 
on the floor if he wasn&#39;t vomiting or in a ball he was screaming 

&quot; Max&quot; Ash screamed &quot; doctor help&quot; 

&quot; My brother&#39;s turning mental&quot; May cried in despair. Dr Mario rushed to 
the room 

&quot; Get out both of you&quot; dr Mario ordered &quot;and wait patiently.&quot; 

As Ash and May walked away letting the doctors perform. They felt like 
vomiting prayers and amens. There was only one person to go to that was 
God and where to feel God&#39;s presence than in a chapel in the hospital. 

At the chapel where it was quite deserted as they emotionally sat at the 
front of the church tears flowing as they prayed for mental Max to 
recover. 

Himeno, Davis, T.K, Kari, Mawata and Hayate came over to the chapel 
Normally to a chapel. The main Japanese religion is Buddhism. The way 
religion has fallen into their hurts is surprising. Yesterday they where 
hyper at the international trip now they where religious and reflecting 
and mourning. At least that&#39;s what it seemed like any way 

&quot; Oh mighty father&quot; Himeno started her prayer 

&quot; Thanks for making this trip the best ever by killing off Dr Spoona and 
Mr Grinal&quot; 

Every one in the chapel tried not to laugh but they all failed 

&quot; Now back to the main purpose&quot; Hayate started &quot; we pray for the sick 
and the poor we pray that Kotono reaches a hasty recovery. We pray for 
little Max 

Amen&quot; 

&quot;Amen&quot; everyone replied,

&quot; we also pray that Grinal and Spoona enjoy afterlife as less as 
possible&quot; Mawata announced the chapel bursted with laughter again 

&quot; God forgive us all&quot; Hayate whispered 

Then Garnet, Roy and Tasha came in the chapel then every one noticed 
certain similarities between Garnet and Ash. They ignored it for a while 
until it was time for the truth to hang out. 

At the monastery about an hour later they returned to their hyper 
selves. They where messing about terribly at last May and Ash could 
forget about the trauma with Max. They had to wait for their new 
teachers to replace Grinal, Spoona and Paykei. Mr OGrady was playing on 
the organ of the hall and the class would sing a long. &quot;KEEP UP&quot; MR 
OGrady shouted &quot; or I&#39;ll get ratty&quot; 

&quot; They can&#39;t sing at all,&quot; Simon Cowell hissed. After all that it would 
be more messing about. 

More insults, more sex, more violence and less peace. It was all split 
into for groups one insulting the dead teachers, one group in love, 
another impersonating the dead teachers and the last group looking for 
trouble. Combining this meant utter chaos. After all it is world war 
three. Then after that the new teachers where revealed it was Ant and 
Dec the famous duo from the u.k 

&quot; Ok students every body in your best suits and dresses for tonight 
because your are all going out to dinner with me&quot; Ant announced then 
left&quot; Actually &quot; Dec whispered &quot; you&#39;re going to the premiere of 
sisters&#39;&quot; then Ant came back again &quot;You will be taken by a limousines, 
all paid by Mr Cowell&quot; Ant said &quot; with an all star cast. You will be 
walking down the red carpet&quot; 

&quot; Yes students all you need to do is get dressed smart and relax.&quot; Dec 
replied. Then as those two left the students started to cheer again
