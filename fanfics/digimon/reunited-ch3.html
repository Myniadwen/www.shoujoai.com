<h1>Reunited: A Tale of Rika and Renamon (part 3 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../digimon/index.html">Digimon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../digimon/reunited-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Rika slowly came back to wakefulness, feeling the warm, soft fur 
brushing up against her face. Her eyes gradually opened to see Renamon 
laying there in bed beside her in her digimon form, and for a moment 
Rika wondered if it was only a dream. But feeling the gentle breathing 
of her companion quickly erased that thought.

Turning over, being careful not to disturb Renamon, Rika smiled to 
herself sadly. The five years they had spent apart had felt like 
forever, but that was all over now. The two of them were together at 
last, and Rika would never let anything separate her from Renamon 
again.

There was a bit of movement on the other side of sleeping pad, and 
Rika turned to see her golden furred lover stretch herself out, her 
golden fur sticking up slightly after her sleep. &#39;Renamon&#39;s version of 
bed-head,&#39; Rika smiled.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Renamon smiled sleepily, her eyes clearly happy. She 
gracefully moved towards Rika, hesitating with her lips just above 
Rika&#39;s.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Rika agreed, and pulled Renamon down into a kiss.

They lay there for a while, each of them just savoring the feeling of 
being together, flesh and furred bodies side by side. &quot;We should get 
moving,&quot; Renamon finally murmured softly, &quot;we might shock your 
grandmother.&quot;

&quot;I rather doubt we could manage that,&quot; Rika chuckled, &quot;but you&#39;re 
right, we should get up.&quot; She got up quite reluctantly, pulling her 
hair back into a ponytail for now.

Renamon gracefully slid off the bed, stretching out languidly. She 
stroked her fur down gently, making the tuffs lay down once again, her 
long tail flowing behind her. &quot;So what do you want to do today?&quot; she 
asked Rika cheerfully.

&quot;Let&#39;s go out together,&quot; Rika smiled up at her.

Renamon slid her arm guards on, then her leggings. &quot;That reminds me,&quot; 
she reached into her arm guard, drawing out a folded card. &quot;Take a 
look at this,&quot; Renamon passed it over to Rika.

Rika flipped it open, blinking. &#39;You are invited to visit Arisugawa&#39;s 
Locket,&#39; the script read, and an address was printed just underneath 
it.

&quot;Where did you get this?&quot; Rika asked curiously.

&quot;A very strange young woman gave it to me in the digital realm,&quot; 
Renamon shrugged, &quot;and no, I have no idea how she got there.&quot;

Rika tapped the invitation thoughtfully against her palm. &quot;Let&#39;s go 
there later today,&quot; she smiled, &quot;maybe you can find the lady and ask 
her.&quot;

&quot;Should be fun,&quot; Renamon chuckled softly. They went down to get 
breakfast first, enduring the very amused gazes coming from both 
Rika&#39;s Mom and Grandmother. &#39;I guess we were making a bit more noise 
last night than we thought we were,&#39; she thought.

Rika wanted to go out for the entire day, something Renamon didn&#39;t 
object to at all. She did suggest that they use the &#39;shapechanging&#39; 
card, to avoid any trouble. Rika wasn&#39;t too happy, but she could see 
Renamon&#39;s point.

Renamon lifted her head, the wind blowing through her blonde hair, 
&quot;I&#39;ve missed that.&quot;

Rika held Renamon&#39;s human hand, marveling again at the transformation 
in her. Renamon was fully human, dressed in borrowed clothes, yet she 
was still her, her essence still the same. &#39;I guess the body never 
really mattered to me,&#39; Rika thought, &#39;just the spirit.&#39;

Rika looked over at Renamon thoughtfully, her long red braid swinging 
behind her, &quot;Did you ever try ice-cream before?&quot;

&quot;No, I haven&#39;t,&quot; Renamon admitted.

Rika grinned, &quot;You&#39;re in for a treat.&quot;

Renamon tried her first lick of an ice-cream cone, and she was doomed. 
Her eyes widened, she smiled, and nearly devoured the first one in 
moments. She took her time with the second one, and clearly took deep 
pleasure from it...

&quot;Uh, Rika?&quot; a familiar voice asked from behind them. Rika turned 
around to see Henry standing there behind them, a sheepish smile on 
his face. His gaze landed on Renamon and they widened in surprise. 
Surprise, and admiration.

&quot;Hello, Henry,&quot; Rika smiled, shooking Renamon a careful look.

Pretending that she hadn&#39;t met him before Renamon smiled warmly up at 
the boy, &quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you.&quot;

&quot;Hi,&quot; Henry blushed red, and Rika nearly spoiled it by laughing. &quot;Have 
we met before?&quot; he tried to start up a conversation.

&quot;Once or twice,&quot; Renamon smiled. She reached over to gently take 
Rika&#39;s hand in hers, &quot;I&#39;m Rika&#39;s lover.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Henry blurted out, and Rika thought she saw a trickle of blood 
come from his nose.

Rika had to laugh as she said to Renamon, &quot;Normally, you should sort 
of lead into it. If you spring that sort of news on people, they tend 
to faint.&quot; She turned to Henry and took pity on him, &quot;Would it help to 
know that she&#39;s Renamon?&quot;

&quot;Renamon?&quot; Henry repeated, looking over at the blonde in surprise. 
Then he nodded thoughtfully before admitting, &quot;I can see it.&quot; He 
blushed slightly, &quot;Sorry.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Renamon smiled gently.

They soon split up, but not before Rika told him all about the 
&#39;shapechanging sorceress&#39; digimon card. Henry left with a thoughtful 
look on his face, obviously considering what it might do to 
Terriermon. Rika and Renamon exchanged a look, and had to laugh.

Eventually, they decided to go check out the invitation Renamon had 
recieved. Renamon returned to her Digimon form to carry them quickly 
across the Tokyo rooftops, and soon both of them were descending to an 
alley nearby. Rika was ready for them to go in as they were, but 
Renamon hesitated.

&quot;Are you sure you want to do this?&quot; Renamon asked Rika softly.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Rika quietly answered. She paused to look up at Renamon, &quot;If 
you want, I can swipe the card, and give you a more human appearance.&quot;

&quot;No, if you&#39;re sure, lets both go in just the way we are,&quot; Renamon 
smiled down at Rika happily, taking Rika&#39;s hand in hers.

The woman standing by the door looked up at their approach, and her 
eyes visibly widened in honest surprise. It was quite obvious that 
this was the first time she had seen a six foot tall fox-woman before.

Renamon smiled at the dark hared woman and regally said, &quot;Good 
evening.&quot; The golden furred fox passed over the card that the odd girl 
Hitomi had given them.

&quot;Welcome, I&#39;m Bones&quot; she smiled, nodding slightly to her and the red- 
headed young woman walking there beside her.

Rika led the way down the darkened hallway as she remarked, &quot;It looks 
like you&#39;ll be getting all the attention.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m used to it,&quot; Renamon sighed, but there was a bit of amusement in 
her voice.

&quot;Welcome to the Locket,&quot; Hitomi beamed at them, &quot;it&#39;s good to see you 
again!&quot;

&quot;Thank you for the invitation,&quot; Rika smiled.

Renamon hesitated, recognizing her as the girl she had met in the 
digital realm. Finally she just had to ask Hitomi, &quot;How did you get to 
the Digital Realm to deliver it, anyway?&quot;

Hitomi shrugged, &quot;Just lucky, I guess.&quot;

Both Rika and Renamon sweatdropped at that.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Rika murmured, looking around her as they walked into the large 
main room. Her eyes lit up when she saw the karaoke stage, &quot;Let&#39;s try 
it!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Renamon sounded honestly confused. She was pleasantly 
surprised at the few reactions they were getting. &#39;Interesting place,&#39; 
she noted.

&quot;You&#39;ve never tried karaoke?&quot; Rika blinked at up her in surprise.

&quot;No,&quot; Renamon admitted.

&quot;Well, maybe later,&quot; Rika smiled, and led Renamon over to the bar. The 
two women pouring the drinks were almost indentical, dangerous 
cat-eyed blue haired beauties. The only difference was that one had 
crescent shaped scars on each of her cheeks.

The unscarred one smiled at them both, &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Ryouko. Well, well, I 
haven&#39;t seen a Digimon in here before. What can I get you folks?&quot;

&quot;Sake, please,&quot; Renamon said with a great deal of dignity.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t call her a kitsune,&quot; Rika blinked with surprise.

&quot;I&#39;m met kitsune before,&quot; Ryouko shrugged. &quot;What would you like?&quot;

&quot;Rum and coke,&quot; Rika smiled. More quietly to Renamon she asked 
wonderingly, &quot;There are real kitsune out there?&quot;

&quot;Apparently so,&quot; Renamon replied.

&quot;Hello,&quot; a friendly voice said from behind them, &quot;welcome to 
Arisugawa&#39;s Locket.&quot; Both Rika and Renamon quickly turned to see a 
woman who was almost as tall as Renamon herself, her orange hair 
flowing down her back.

Rika bowed a bit, &quot;Hello, I&#39;m Rika, and this is Renamon.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m Juri,&quot; she smiled at them, &quot;it&#39;s nice to have you here. If 
there&#39;s anything you need, just mention it, and I&#39;ll try to help.&quot; She 
looked up and frowned slightly, &quot;Excuse me.&quot; With that, she got up and 
headed off into the crowd. &quot;Filla, Naga, if you want to fight over 
Lina, take to outside!&quot; she was soon heard to yell.

&quot;A very interesting place,&quot; Renamon smiled, &quot;I think I like it.&quot;

Rika and Renamon eventually took their drinks over to an empty table, 
settling down to watch the crowds go by. A few moments later, and a 
young woman dressed in a crisp maids outfit appeared carrying a note 
pad.

&quot;Would you like to order dinner?&quot; May asked cheerfully. She ran 
through the list of dishes available tonight, and then casually 
mentioned, &quot;Several rooms are also still available for a few hours or 
the night.&quot;

Renamon looked a bit confused for a moment, then she blushed, 
realizing what the rooms were probably for. Rika took over ordering 
the food, smiling over at Renamon sympathetically. They ate the 
delicious foods happily, then got up to dance for a bit.

Finally, Rika decided that it was time to try the karaoke. She ran 
through the song collection, and began to quietly laugh when she found 
the perfect one. She set it up, and then pulled a reluctant Renamon up 
on stage.

&quot;We two are one,&quot; by the Erythmics, started up.

The Characters from Arisugawa&#39;s Locket: The bar&#39;s owner is Arisugawa

Author&#39;s Notes: Some of the material for this chapter first appeared 
in a chapter of Arisugawa&#39;s Locket, my bar based x-over series. After 
the end of Digimon Tamers, I figure Rika and Renamon deserved a 
&#39;happily ever after&#39; and this fic is it. I&#39;ve left this open to 
continue, and may deal with them fighting viral digimon eventually, 
but for now, this is it.

Hope you enjoyed it, and try some of my other fics!
