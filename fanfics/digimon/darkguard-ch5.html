<h1>Dark Guardian: A Tale of Rika and Renamon (part 5 of 12)</h1>

<a href="../digimon/darkguard-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>        Rio held his tongue, but only until they had left the court 
chambers and were in a private chamber nearby. &quot;How could you?!&quot; he 
demanded of Rika disbelievingly, stepping up to almost shout his words 
into her face.

        Renamon moved like a shot to shove him back from Rika with 
only one hand, her expression nearly murderous as she said, &quot;I do not 
care for your tone, sir. Moderate it, or else.&quot;

        Rio paled at the fierce look on her face and took another step 
away from them.

        Rika gently put her hand on Renamon&#39;s arm, and her protector 
visibly worked to control her temper. She looked at Rio and Rika asked 
him softly, but with intensity, &quot;Can you tell me of one law that 
forbids them their request? Even one?&quot;

        Rio sighed softly, admitting, &quot;I can&#39;t.&quot;

        Rika continued on, &quot;I will not make my decisions based on whom 
they might or might not offend. I must follow my conscience, whatever 
the cost.&quot;

        It was quite obvious from the look on his face that Rio 
strongly disagreed with her, and he probably would continue to, but 
there was something else there as well. A grudging respect was visible 
as he said, &quot;So be it, milady.&quot; With those words, he turned about and 
marched away.

        &quot;Perhaps he&#39;s not so much of a toad as you had thought,&quot; Rika 
murmured to Renamon softly once he was gone.

        Renamon smiled at her wryly, &quot;Personally, I&#39;d wait to see what 
he says about you when you&#39;re not with him.&quot; She shook her head, 
dismissing him from her thoughts as she asked Rika, &quot;What do you want 
to do now?&quot;

        Rika sighed, &quot;I&#39;ll need to prepare for all the formal protests 
from the priests and noble families, most likely.&quot;

        Renamon hesitated for a moment, looking down at the young 
noble lady who was standing before her. She saw the lines of stress 
that still remained on her face, even with the good night&#39;s sleep that 
she had been getting lately.

        &quot;What?&quot; Rika asked, a bit of a flush appearing on her cheeks.

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Renamon smiled slightly. Softly she asked, &quot;Instead 
of waiting for them to trouble you, how would you like to take a day 
off?&quot;

        Rika&#39;s face lit up, then she frowned, shaking her head. Softly 
she said, &quot;The courtiers and nobles would never allow it.&quot;

        Renamon gave her a smile that could almost be described as 
evil, &quot;I wasn&#39;t thinking of asking them.&quot; A little pause, &quot;Do you want 
to?&quot;

        Rika just had to smile back, &quot;Yes.&quot;

        &quot;Good,&quot; and Renamon surprised her by stepping forward and 
picking Rika up. She cried out softly in surprise, even as she felt 
those arms holding her gently close. &quot;Put your arms around my neck,&quot; 
Renamon her advised, &quot;and hold on tight.&quot;

        &quot;Why do I need to...&quot; Rika started, but did what she was told.

        &quot;Because of this,&quot; Renamon grinned.

        Rika gasped, as Renamon bounded down the darkened hallway, 
then right out the upper floor window. They seemed to hang there in 
midair, then almost soundlessly dropped down onto a slate roof. 
Renamon skimmed over the surface then leaped from roof to roof again 
and again. They soon reached the edge of town, and somehow remained 
utterly unseen by the townsfolk.

        Rika laughed softly, muffling her voice against Renamon&#39;s 
soft, sweet smelling fur. &quot;That was incredible,&quot; she told her softly.

        &quot;We&#39;re not done yet,&quot; Renamon said laughingly.

        They crossed the fields of golden wheat at the edge of town 
soundlessly, leaving almost no sign of their passage behind them. The 
cool forest embraced them both, as Renamon moved through it like it 
was her natural home. She leapt up into the tree branches, continuing 
on soundlessly.

        &quot;It&#39;s beautiful,&quot; Rika murmured, looking about her in awe.

        Renamon slowed just a bit, the leaves swirling about them for 
a moment, &quot;Yes it is.&quot;

        They reached a massive stone face, and like a cat Renamon 
climbed it easily. It seemed such a harsh place, almost stark against 
the soft green of the forest, and Rika began to wonder just where 
Renamon was taking her. They came to the top, and Renamon leaped down, 
bringing them to a rest upon... a field of green.

        It was almost like an oasis, this place of vibrant green 
concealed in cold, hard rock. A few trees grew up, gathering sunlight, 
and the ground was covered with springy, soft grass. A spring burbled 
up water that Rika just knew would be both cool and sweet.

        &quot;It&#39;s.. wonderful,&quot; Rika murmured as Renamon gently set her 
down, knowing that her words were completely inadequate.

        &quot;I found it years ago,&quot; Renamon said softly, &quot;and it became my 
refuge, when my life grew too difficult. I&#39;ve never told anyone else 
about it, until now.&quot;

        Rika looked at her, her eyes wide, &quot;But, what if I spoil it 
for you?&quot;

        With a gentle smile on her face Renamon said, &quot;You could never 
do that.&quot;

        Rika smiled back at her, a few tears glinting in her eyes as 
she said, &quot;Thank you.&quot; She took a few steps, then sat down to pull off 
her pair of boots, then strip off her socks. With a blissful sigh she 
wriggled her bare toes in the grass.

        Renamon just had to smile at such obvious enjoyment. The tall 
kitsune paced over to a large stone nearby the spring, and with a 
surprising show of strength rolled it aside. Beneath was a cache of 
supplies, kept chilled by the waters of the spring beside it.

        The bag of wine Renamon pulled out caused Rika to raise her 
eyebrow in question. Renamon laughed softly, &quot;I was assured that it 
would age well.&quot; She uncorked it, took a sniff, and her smile 
broadened, &quot;It seems I chose well.&quot;

        Renamon passed the wine over, and Rika took a tentative drink. 
Her eyes widened and she gasped, &quot;Whoo! That&#39;s got some kick.&quot;

        Renamon drew out dried meats and some preserved fruit, 
carrying them over to Rika&#39;s side. She accepted the wine back and took 
a drink, before setting it down between them. &quot;Hmm, jerky,&quot; Renamon 
pulled some off with her teeth before passing it on to Rika.

        As Rika accepted it she softly said, &quot;I&#39;m glad you chose to 
share this place with me.&quot;

        Renamon had a slice of fruit, while she carefully considered 
her answer. &quot;I&#39;ve never known anyone more worthy,&quot; she finally said. 
It wasn&#39;t quite what Renamon really wanted to say to Rika, but for now 
it would serve.

        Rika didn&#39;t choose to answer her verbally, instead she simply 
lay her hand over Renamon&#39;s and squeezed it gently.
