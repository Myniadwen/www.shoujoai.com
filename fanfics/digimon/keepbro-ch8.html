fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../digimon/keepbro-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Tasha walked around the cramped streets of Tokyo, then she noticed four 
girls from her brother&#39;s school one of the girls noticed Tasha as the 
girls eyes turned yellow.&nbsp;Miyu why are you looking at me like that I&#39;m 
your cousin Tasha thought confusingly as Miyu slowly turned around and 
faced her best friends. Tasha noticed Ash and May walking down the 
street. They both turned around and spotted her face. They both came 
towards Tasha holding hands. 

&quot;Hi Tasha &quot; Ash smiled. 

&quot;Hi&quot; Tasha replied. 

&quot;Any way I was thinking,&quot; Ash started, &quot; ya wanna hang round with us &quot; 

&quot;I&#39;d love to&quot; Tasha smiled. &quot;What will we do?&quot; 

&quot;Walk around the city, meet up with some mates play basketball or 
something.&quot; Ash replied 

&quot;Ok then&quot; Tasha replied 

&quot; Tasha&quot; May call out. 

&quot;Yes May?&quot; Tasha replied calmly 

&quot;Can I ask you a few questions about the bible?&quot; May asked 

&quot;Go on&quot; 

&quot;Why does it always refer to lambs all the time?&quot; 

&quot;Well May&quot; Tasha replied, &quot; Jesus is known as the lamb of God because he 
was God&#39;s only son. God is known as the Shepard....&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s a Shepard?&quot; May asked. 

&quot;A Shepard is someone who leads sheep and lambs to safety&quot; Tasha 
answered not bothered about May&#39;s constant questions about the bible. 
&quot;Kinda like what you and Ash being a trainer&quot; 

&quot; They had to stop that&quot; May replied &quot;because of this good for nothing 
war&quot; 

&quot;I agree,&quot; Tasha, replied, &quot;wars are useless&quot; 

&quot;Any way&quot; Ash interrupted &quot; Tasha, do you know this Miyu Yamano?&quot; 

Tasha turned silent. &quot;She&#39;s my cousin&quot; Tasha replied. &quot;Angelica&#39;s 
step-Daughter, Zelda&#39;s Daughter&quot;&nbsp;



4 P.M Max, Cody, Ken, Yolei, Davis, Jun, Ash, May and Tasha walked 
around the streets of Tokyo meeting up at the school gates with TK and 
Gary. 

&quot; Davis, try not to be harsh on TK,&quot; Ash demanded politely &quot;he&#39;s had a 
rough time, it would be amazing if he even turns up today.&quot; 

&quot;He&#39;s a violent bastard&quot; Davis replied 

&quot; As far as I&#39;m concerned,&quot; Max announced, &quot;TK got what he dissevered&quot; 

&quot; Why did they even go back together in the first place if they knew 
this would happen?&quot; Yolei asked 

Tasha stopped. &quot; Because they didn&#39;t know this would happen&quot; Tasha 
announced. Then she carried on walking &quot; Kari&#39;s mind has been very 
troubled for the past year you should all realise that, then she fell 
for Misty, got pregnant as everything took it&#39;s toll on her. So she ran 
away with her child and lover, not realising who she hurts the most&quot; 

&quot; TK, Tai, me all those who were close to her&quot; Davis answered. 

&quot;We mustn&#39;t forget Misty&quot; Ash shouted out. Nearly all the gang booed at 
Misty. May and Tasha stood their with a firm face. 

&quot;Why do all hate her?&quot; Tasha asked, &quot; has she not suffered as badly,&quot; 
the gang seemed embarrassed. &quot;Wish for their harm will only make you no 
different to them.&quot; 

May and Ash nodded in agreement. Davis&#39;s face seemed less beliving.&nbsp;May 
looked at Jun. 

&quot;John,&quot; May smiled at Jun &quot;you&#39;ve rather quiet&quot; 

He gang started laughing, as Jun&#39;s face turned red with embarrassment 
and anger. Davis was laughing the hardest so hard he collapsed happily 
to the floor. 

&quot;Sorry&quot; May replied to Jun&nbsp;&quot;Jun&quot; however the laughter&#39;s where so hard 
that May&#39;s apology was unheard. They where finally at the school gates, 
infact they where there for the past five minutes but ignored Gary; Only 
Gary was there, 

&quot;TK not coming then&quot; Ash said knowing the answer 

&quot;No&quot; Gary replied, &quot;Kari that fucking bicth sent him some bloody 
disgusting porno film.&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s so mean about that?&quot; Davis replied. 

&quot; The one with Misty and Kari shagging eachother in front of Rosie&quot; Ash 
replied in a shock. 

&quot;That&#39;s the one&quot; Gary replied. 

&quot;May got sent one like that&quot; Ash replied, &quot; It makes me sick just 
thinking about that film.&quot; 

&quot;Show me the film&quot; Davis demanded at May angrily. As May showed the tape 
she turned away and took Max&#39;s glasses. Davis was glued to the phone, 
hearing their screams of pleasure. 

&quot; I&#39;ll fucking kill that ginger lesbian if it&#39;s the last thing I do!&quot; 
Davis roared with anger. May turned of the film and returned Max&#39;s 
glasses 

&quot; Hey May I wanted to see that porno film&quot; Max moaned 

&quot;Honestly&quot; Cody replied, &quot;you would not want to see it.&quot; 

Ken gave Gary horrid stares as the gang played basketball in the 
playground. 

Jun came over to Gary as Tasha was playing basketball. 

&quot;Why the bloody hell are you here?&quot; Gary spat at Jun &quot; why did you come 
with Tasha?&quot; 

&quot;Hey&quot; Jun smiled &quot;I&#39;m just hanging round with my family and friends,&quot; 
then Jun had her arm around Gary &quot; besides you can&#39;t a girl just 
checking out the competition.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s not your competition&quot; Gary muttered &quot; that is my wife!&quot; 

&quot;She sounds feeble to me&quot; Jun smirked rubbing Gary&#39;s body. 

&quot; Jun&quot; Gary snapped quietly. &quot; Our family and friends are right in front 
of us&quot; Jun turned around 

&quot;No one can see us&quot; Jun replied tickling Gary. 

&quot;Just find a fucking private place&quot; Gary muttered &quot;where they can&#39;t 
bloody see us&quot;
