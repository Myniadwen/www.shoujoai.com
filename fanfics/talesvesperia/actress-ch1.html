<pre>&quot;-taaaaaaa...&quot;
&quot;Rita!&quot;
&quot;Hm?&quot; A short brunette mage looked over to the women who called her name. Such an annoying 
voice from such an annoying woman. So much for enjoying the beautiful scenes outside the 
carriage.
&quot;What is with you lately? You&#39;re always staring off into space and you&#39;re always 
day-dreaming right in the middle of battle. You know if it wasn&#39;t for me--&quot;
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right: if it wasn&#39;t for you, this trip would be a hell of a lot more 
enjoyable. Always so self-righteous, always in the right, can never do any wrong. Yet I daze 
off for one second - one measly miniscule second - and it&#39;s like I&#39;m being scolded for 
letting the world explode.&quot;
&quot;Rita, are you listening to me?!&quot;
&quot;Yes...yes, I&#39;m listening! I&#39;m bad at battle and I&#39;m dozing off...etcetera, etcetera, &quot; Rita 
sighs, &quot;Look, if you don&#39;t want me here just say so, alright?&quot;
&quot;I never said that.&quot;
&#39;No, but you were thinking it, you blue-haired harlot.&#39;
The blued haired elf, Judith, sat wayside from the short brunette mage. Judith was dressed 
in some of the skimpiest clothes this side of Dangrest: a white skirt that opens in the 
front allowing a clear view of the woman&#39;s legs all the way up to her thighs, right where 
her blue shorts begin, not to mention her bikini top and sleeves. &#39;God&#39; she thought, &#39;This 
woman gives us a bad name. Not to mention the blastia she&#39;s been destroying. I can&#39;t believe 
our &#39;charismatic&#39; leader wanted to go find this tramp.&#39;
&quot;Rita, stop staring off into space. If I didn&#39;t know any better, I would say you didn&#39;t like 
me,&quot; Judith pouted.
&quot;Well, what gave you your first clue?&quot; Rita spat. &quot;Everyone else may have forgiven you and 
opened up their arms for you, but not me. I don&#39;t see how they could possibly forgive you if 
you go running around destroying the objects we use every day for our god-damn survival! 
Give me one good reason, just one, and I&#39;ll forgive you.&quot;
&quot;I know about your love for Estelle.&quot;
&#39;Talk about a low blow,&#39; Rita thought, taken aback. &#39;Where did that even come from?&#39;
&quot;I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about,&quot; Rita crossed her arms defiantly over her red 
garment with a slight flush to her cheeks, and gazed out the window: as if her reaction to 
her love for Estelle wasn&#39;t painfully obvious to begin with. &#39;How else was a 15 year old 
girl supposed to act? With confused hormones and the fact that the girl I fell in love with 
is the most beautiful thing to grace the green earth,&#39; Rita began flushing a bit more.
&quot;I knew it. It&#39;s not that hard to tell with you fawning all over her.&quot;
&quot;Who&#39;s fawning?!&quot; the brunette shot back, venom dripped in her voice. &#39;I already don&#39;t like 
her, who is she to say she knows ANYTHING about me?!&#39;
&quot;How dare you?! How dare you claim to know what I feel for her! It&#39;s none of your business, 
so why should you care!&quot; Rita screamed, voice cracking.
&quot;Because I like to press your buttons. Though, I figure that if I help you out with this 
little problem then you would be fine accepting me as part of the group. Even Repede 
accepted me, and that&#39;s rare. How can you be the only one who hasn&#39;t?&quot;
&quot;Because!...&quot; Rita stammered and began to trip over her words. No matter how much the genius 
mage tried to think of an excuse, it wouldn&#39;t come to her. &quot;...Fine...I-If you can help me, 
I guess I can admit that you&#39;re not so bad,&quot; Rita flushed more and stared out the window of 
their caravan once again. &quot;So what do I have to do?&quot;
&quot;All in good time. After all, you can&#39;t force love,&quot; Judith shook her finger to the 
brunette. &quot;The best way to do it is to get her alone with you and try to get her to see your 
good qualities. After all, you fawn over her and she does the same naively,&quot; Judith leaned 
back and crossed her legs. &quot;That&#39;s probably your best bet with the cards that you were 
dealt.&quot;
&quot;How would I even do that ? She&#39;s hooked arm-to-arm with that damned Yuri.&quot;
&quot;Awww...you&#39;re feeling self-conscious. Don&#39;t worry, I know how to take care of Yuri,&quot; Judith 
purred and cast a side-long glance, she twisted her hair between her fingers.
&quot;What do you mean you know how to take care of Yuri?&quot; Rita cocked an eyebrow. &quot;No, you know 
what,&quot; Rita shook her hands in front of her almost defensively. &quot;I don&#39;t want to know.&quot;
&quot;Anyway, I think you should just kiss her and get it over with?&quot;
&quot;W-What!?&quot; Rita&#39;s face turned more crimson than the garb she was wearing. After a little bit 
of time to cool down, Rita grabbed a pen from her pocket and notepad and started writing 
down what Judith was saying concerning what she should do and how.
While the two of the girls were talking they arrived at Capua Torim, their destination. 
After a little rest on their part, they would head for the Capital town of Zaphias.
The brunette stepped out of her caravan after Judith. For all of her consistent bitching and 
her &#39;holier then thou&#39; flirty attitude, Judith wasn&#39;t all that bad. Even though the party 
was small, two caravans were needed: &#39;Seems they don&#39;t make them as big as they used too,&#39; 
Rita thought as she walked over to the other caravan, she had hoped to find their little 
Princess before everyone got too involved with their own relaxation. No one happened to be 
in the caravan at all. &#39;Damn; I guess I missed her. Maybe she&#39;ll be at the inn by now.&#39;



Rita walked into a little hole-in-the-wall hotel. &quot;Yes Ma&#39;am how may I help you?&quot; the 
inn-keeper, a fat and reasonably plump lady with a nice smile greeted her.
&quot;I&#39;m with Yuri Lowell&#39;s group,&quot; Rita mentioned; she felt a little confused as well as 
flustered from her previous conversation with Judith. She also had no idea if Yuri had 
bought the rooms yet.
&quot;Ah, yes, here we go. Ms. Lowell, I presume.&quot;
&quot;&#39;Ms&#39;...Lowell?&quot;
&quot;The daughter correct?&quot; the innkeeper asked, she grew slightly suspicious.
&quot;Oh! Oh yes...I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ve never been called Ms. before, it caught me off guard.&quot;
The innkeeper nodded and smiled, handing &quot;Ms. Lowell&quot; her room key.
&#39;I swear to god, if I ever get my hands on that stupid piece of...ugh! The nerve of that 
asshole, pretending I&#39;m his daughter. The very thought of being related to him pisses me off 
more then anything on this entire god-damn fuc-&#39;
&quot;There&#39;s my little girl!&quot; A nonchalant voice broke her from her thoughts. The man strode 
over to her and ruffled her short brunette hair. It was Yuri and Rita glared at him with icy 
daggers: &#39;if looks could kill&#39;. Rita smiled widely and held onto Yuri, and hugged him 
tightly.
&quot;Daddy!&quot; She began to plot Yuri&#39;s downfall and ways to make his life a living hell. Rita 
grabbed and hung off of Yuri&#39;s arm. &quot;Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! I wanna go see the festival in 
Halure! Can we please? Please? Please? Please? Pleeeeaaaase?&quot; Rita whined. Yuri cringed, and 
tried to shake her off.
&quot;A bit later, tomorrow after everyone has rested, alright?&quot; The two, &#39;Father and daughter,&#39; 
began up the stairs arm and arm with each other. They reached the top of the stairs and Rita 
yelled at Yuri in whispers.
&quot;What the HELL is wrong with you? Making me your daughter!? I may only be 15, but I am so 
not related to you! How could anyone ever wanna be related to such a dunderhead is beyond 
the scope of even my knowledge and I&#39;m a friggan genius!&quot;
&quot;Would you keep it down?! We get a discounted family rate and it was the only way we could 
afford this inn. Would you rather sleep in the caravans tonight?!&quot;
The innkeeper walked up the stairs to see what all the trifling had been about. In her inn? 
Not while she&#39;s around, &quot;Excuse me, is everything alright?&quot;
&quot;No!&quot; &quot;Yes!&quot; She heard from the two in unison. And just for a moment she could swear she saw 
fire from the young girl&#39;s fingertips.
&quot;Just calm down, alright!&quot; Yuri shoved the brunette into the closest room, and shut the door 
behind the both of them. This room just happened to be one of the rooms that was bought 
under his name. However, it just so happened to be the girls&#39; room. It also just so happened 
that there was a particular pink haired princess in that room changing, as the two 
obliviously fought with each other. Yuri stopped dead in his tracks and flushed crimson up 
to his ears.
Rita also flushed crimson, but turned it toward Yuri masking her embarrassment as anger. 
&quot;Get the fuck out! PERVERT!&quot; The brunette slammed her body into Yuri&#39;s pushing him out the 
door, and oh so conveniently down the stairs as well. An older gentleman by the name of 
Raven saw what happened and helped his wayward leader up to his feet. Raven led Yuri out of 
the inn and to the closest bar, from what Rita could tell as she peered through the window. 
&#39;I will never, never, NEVER understand men. How could they get drunk at a time like this. 
The world&#39;s in mortal danger and he wants to get drunk. Then again, am I really any better 
with my love issues?&#39;
Estelle stood in the room and modestly covered herself, flushed redder than anyone had been 
that entire day. She was even redder than Rita, who stood there, dumbstruck, as she stared 
at her love bare-naked in front of her. Estelle hit the floor quicker then gravity could 
pull her.
&quot;Estelle!?&quot; Rita rushed over to her and picked her up. Rita shook her, &quot;Hey!&quot; Rita panicked 
and ran through the basics of checking vitals. She was fine, her chest rose and fell and she 
was a healthy color. But here she was with the woman she loved in her arms, passed out. Free 
for Rita to do whatever she wanted to do to her. &#39;Would it be right? To take advantage of 
her when she&#39;s like this? Then again, when will I ever get the chance to do anything with 
her, even when she&#39;s awake and coherent.&#39;
Without mush thought, Rita ran her hand down the girl&#39;s curves, and traced Estelle&#39;s hips 
and her bust with her finger tips. &#39;What am I doing? This so wrong! But...but I can&#39;t help 
myself. I want her so badly, it hurts.&#39; Rita went a little farther and smoothly ran her 
fingers up and down her legs. &#39;Her skin is so smooth.&#39; A faint blush graced Rita&#39;s cheeks. 
The brunette&#39;s fingers ran up along Estelle&#39;s cheeks as Rita leaned in closer. Her heart was 
in her throat and beat so violently, &#39;This is wrong!&#39; kept running through her head. It 
didn&#39;t matter anymore, she wanted this and nothing was going to stop her anymore. Not her 
half-witted philosophy of wrong and right, nor her meek personality when it comes to 
portraying one&#39;s feelings.
Rita&#39;s lips met hers for the briefest of seconds. A moist soft feeling came to her as she 
pulled back. Tracing her forefinger along her rosy-hued lips, she leaned in once more and 
kissed Estelle again, wrapping a hand around the pink haired princess&#39; neck. &#39;This is so 
wrong. Then why does it feel so good...?&#39; Rita kissed her deeper than she had before, and 
probed Estelle&#39;s mouth with her tongue. Her fingers traced down Estelle&#39;s sides; Rita pulled 
back with a heavy breath. Estelle was still passed out in the young mage&#39;s arms. &#39;This was 
too dangerous, what if she woke up during this? This is bad; this is really, really bad.&#39; 
Rita picked Estelle up and put her on her respective bed. &#39;This is wrong, I can&#39;t do this 
anymore.&#39; Rita put her in a large t-shirt and pulled the covers over her, and made sure the 
room&#39;s door was locked. Rita sighed heavily and walked out of the inn, the key twirled on 
her finger.

&#39;This is ridiculous, this is utterly fucking STUPID!&#39; Rita sighed and walked to the bridge 
in town. The bridge led to the Duke&#39;s manor, decorated in pewter street lamps that flickered 
with a bright candle light. Rita curled over the awning to the bridge and moaned softly to 
herself. &quot;This is so fucking stupid.&quot; Once she finished speaking to no one in particular, 
she felt a warm breath at the back of her ear. Rita shrieked and attempted to turn around, 
and fell on her ass in the process. She looked up to see Judith whom towered over her. &quot;What 
the hell Judith, that was uncalled for!&quot;
Rita stood back up to Judith, and stared her right in the eye. &quot;But you&#39;re so cute when 
you&#39;re embarrassed.&quot; Judith&#39;s lips curled slightly into that wicked smirk of hers. &quot;So how 
did it go?&quot;
&quot;What do you mean? How did what go?&quot; Rita questioned, one eyebrow cocked. &#39;She couldn&#39;t 
possibly know what just happened could she? Oh god, what if she does?!&#39;
Judith strut by her and leaned along the awning to the bridge. &quot;Don&#39;t play dumb with me; you 
know damn well what I am talking about. What were you attempting to do to our little 
Princess, huh?&quot;
Rita stammered and turned her back on the blue-haired elf. &quot;How could I possibly know what 
you&#39;re talking about.&quot;
&quot;Stop feigning ignorance, you and I both know what went on in that room. I saw your little 
escapade. Now, Rita, I&#39;m ashamed of you; how could you possibly do such a thing?&quot; Judith 
scolded her, much like a disappointed parent.
&quot;I...&quot; Rita stammered and turned to her. Tears welled up in her eyes. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean too, I 
couldn&#39;t help it: I wanted her so much! Haven&#39;t you ever felt that way? Where you&#39;ve wanted 
someone so much it hurts? You can&#39;t possibly live without this person. You would rather slit 
your own wrists than see harm come to them?! How could you possibly have any idea what I&#39;m 
feeling!? How could any of you!?&quot; Tear&#39;s flowed freely down Rita&#39;s cheeks now. &quot;How about 
you all stay out of my business and just kindly FUCK OFF!&quot; Rita pushes past Judith and runs 
down the bridge.
&quot;Rita, hold on!&quot; Judith shouted to no avail; Rita either didn&#39;t hear or didn&#39;t care.
&quot;So how did it go?&quot; Yuri smiled softly and walked up the bridge to Judith. &quot;I take it not so 
well, huh?&quot;
&quot;That stupid little bitch! We all try to help her, but she&#39;s so wrapped up in her own stupid 
little world that she won&#39;t listen to any of us, much less reason! Ugh!&quot; Judith growled. 
&quot;Here I thought I would do something nice for her and it blows up in my face.&quot;
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t let it get to you; she&#39;s stubborn and hot-headed. Just give her time, she&#39;ll 
come around. It&#39;s her own life; let her make her own decisions. Just watch, she&#39;s a fool, 
but she&#39;s an honest fool. She&#39;ll be back, but we&#39;re not going to leave without her,&quot; Yuri 
grinned to the frustrated Judith, who walked closer to her; he grabs her waist and pulls her 
toward him.
Rita mentally shrieked, &#39;How could they all be so stupid, what does it matter what they 
think?&#39; Rita had ran out of town, perhaps the mage tried to run away from her problems, 
leaving them far behind her in the port town of Capua Torim. Rita stopped near a tree to 
gaze at the lights of the port city off on the horizon. &quot;I suppose this is far enough.&quot;
Rita leaned down and slumped along the tree. &quot;This is stupid, why did I run away? I&#39;ve never 
ran away before.&quot; Rita wiped what was left of her tears out of her eyes and sighed deeply. 
&#39;I&#39;ll stay here for a little bit then; I&#39;ll go back when everyone is out.&#39;
Rita sat there admiring the stars. Bored at staring at the starts, Rita discovered a few 
foot-holes and proceeds to climb a knotted and twisted tree. Her eyes quickly got heavy and 
she slowly dozed off.

Rita awoke to a squirrel on her chest, who fidgeted and fumbled through her breast pocket. 
The squirrel stole a pen and ran down the branch. &quot;Hey! Give that back!&quot; Rita gave chase and 
shimmied her way down the branch. Every time she got relatively close to the squirrel it ran 
further and further down the branch. Finally the branch snapped under Rita&#39;s weight and she 
fell several feet to the ground. &quot;OWWWWWWWWWWWW! Son of a bitch!!! Geezus that hurts.&quot; Rita 
stood up and looked herself over, brushed the dirt and leaves out of her outfit.
Rita pulled a twig out of her hair and sighed. &#39;Stupid squirrel. That was my last pen..&#39; 
Rita began the trek back to Capua Torim, and cursed the gods for her luck and her stupid 
pen.
Rita sighed at her luck. &#39;How could things possibly get any worse than this?&#39; The sullen 
witch crossed her arms over her chest as she slugged her way back to the city. &#39;Just when 
things were starting to get good, I get scared and run away. I still can&#39;t believe that I - 
Rita Mordio &acirc;&#128;&#147; just ran away!&#39; She tossed her arms up in the air in aggravation. To anyone 
whom watched her, it would look like was in the middle of a fit and stomped away from an 
argument. Rita noticed elongated shadows to her left and her right. That couldn&#39;t be normal, 
from the shadows, she deduced that they must be people after her. Rita started at a brisk 
pace, power walking. She didn&#39;t run, she didn&#39;t want them to give chase. &#39;Maybe they&#39;ll get 
bored and go away. Just got to make it to town before anything happens.&#39; Rita made the 
mistake of looking behind her. The genius mage had a very high opinion of herself, but to 
take down six men at once was pushing it, even for her.
The young witch stopped short when she ran into a man with a long scar down his right eye 
and scruffy hair. A few more men circled around her; &quot;Oh shit...&quot; Rita moaned. One man, with 
long, black and tangled hair stepped forward slowly, drawing a sword from his scabbard. The 
bandit lunged forward and missed as Rita spun out of the way with more grace than a dancer. 
Rita pulled her whip from her belt and shot it forward, grabbed another man&#39;s sword from his 
hand, and pulled it to the ground. &#39;There doesn&#39;t seem to be much way out of this. I&#39;ll cast 
a spell and make a run for it. If I&#39;m lucky they&#39;ll be confused and that will give me the 
chance to get away.&#39;
&quot;Spread oh Merciful Dar-&quot; Rita had put her plan into motion, but had been caught by surprise 
by a sweeping sword to her arm. Blood kissed the ground and Rita slid back on her feet. She 
gritted her teeth and cauterized her wound with a quick fire spell. A black shadow was cast 
over Rita and she quickly turned around to a sword in her gut, knocking the wind out of her. 
Rita doubled over and gasped for air. She doubted any air was getting to her lungs and 
panicked. One of the bandits, the man with the scar over his eye, grinned down at her and 
brought the handle of his sword down on Rita&#39;s head. Before her eyes failed her, Estelle 
flashed through her vision, then nothingness, darkness: infinite black.
Rita came to, eyes being blinded by the light of the sun. &#39;What happened? Oh...right.&#39; Rita 
cringed from the light of the sun, burying her face to ground. Her head throbbed, the light 
didn&#39;t make things any better. &#39;Why am I moving?&#39; The mage braved the light to find herself 
on a cart, tied up. Rita&#39;s arms were bound behind her back and her wrists were bound 
together by thick rope. Her legs were in a similar state, though bent at the knee with her 
calves and thighs tied together as well. Her clothes were gone, dressed in nothing but the 
camisole she had changed into the previous morning. Rita flushed and curled up the best she 
could. Her mind raced with &quot;What If&#39;s&quot; and was afraid that she had already been &quot;used&quot; while 
she was unconscious. She prayed and hoped to whatever god would listen that her thoughts 
would not be the case. She struggled a bit and deep voice piped up. &quot;Oi, looks like ta lidle 
one is wakin&#39; up.&quot;
&quot;Leave her be, we be comin&#39; up on ta town anyways,&quot; someone ahead called out.
Rita fought against her restraints, but couldn&#39;t break them no matter how much she wiggled 
and rolled around in the cart. A stroke of luck came when the cart&#39;s wheel was struck with a 
rock. Rita successfully wiggled herself off the cart. Her plan wasn&#39;t thought out nor well 
executed, but it was a chance she had to take to try and escape. Still being bound, she 
wasn&#39;t quite sure what to do next. The man with the long and tattered black hair picked her 
up and threw her back into the cart. Rita landed sharply on her back and shrieked as her 
wounded head smashed the cart. Rita coughed up a few trickles of blood. Her abdomen was 
being assaulted by a piercing pain, Rita thought she had broken a few of her ribs. There was 
no way she was going to able to escape this, so she gave up on her hope.
&quot;O brilliant blade of coldest steel,&quot; A deep voice came from a tree, a large figure dashed 
in front of the bandits too fast for any of them to see. One of the men who carted Rita 
around fell to his knees and with a large gash in his chest, then to the ground, a puddle of 
blood grew around him.
&quot;Rend thy infinite darkness,&quot; The second man, larger and more robust than the first howled a 
shriek of pain as his knee caps were slashed in two.
&quot;And crush my enemies to nothing!&quot; The last man had lost his head, tumbling down the road 
and into a nearby bush. The last man, the one with the scar, stood in front of the cart, 
dumbfounded by what was going on, had grabbed Rita to use as a shield.
&quot;Shoot it now Raven!&quot; A higher pitched voice, but still male, cried out.
An arrow wined near the man&#39;s head taking off his ear. &quot;Shit!&quot; He screamed, dropping Rita in 
the process, who, at this point, was unconscious of her surroundings, to grab at his ear in 
an attempt to stop the bleeding.
Raven loaded up another arrow in his bow and shot once more, hitting his target with 
pinpoint accuracy. The last bandit fell to the ground with a blank expressionless stare, his 
blood pooling under his head.

The sound of arguing filtered through the haze clouding Rita&#39;s brain as she pulled herself 
into consciousness. She began to stir, and Yuri noticed the movement, and began screaming at 
her.
&quot;Where the hell were you!?&quot; Yuri snapped.
&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry? I don&#39;t even know where I am right now!&quot; Rita screamed back with her raspy 
voice.
Raven sat Yuri down and smiled to Rita. &quot;We&#39;re at the inn, back in Capua Torim. Are you 
okay?&quot;
&quot;What do you mean, &#39;Am I okay?&#39; Of course I&#39;m o-...-kay&quot; Rita&#39;s wounds flared up in a 
instance, she screamed and gripped her abdomen as she furled in upon herself.
Tears welled in her eyes, Rita grabbed her head: it was throbbed from all the blows she took 
earlier. She curled herself up, and hoped that would subdue the pain, that it would make 
everything, everyone&#39;s pity and demeanor to look down on her because of her age, go away.
&quot;God-damn it Rita, how could you not have been able to take them down!?&quot; Yuri picked Rita up 
by her garb and shook her.
&quot;Calm down Yuri!&quot; Raven pushed Yuri away. &quot;The last thing we need right now is to be at each 
other&#39;s throats! So sit down and shut the hell up!&quot; Raven yelled. &quot;Now you can&#39;t blame her 
for getting kidnapped, it was a fluke, could&#39;ve happened to you if you were in her state.&quot;
&quot;Would everyone just shut up!&quot; Rita&#39;s pain shook her to her very core, and everyone&#39;s 
yelling was not helping her headache go away.
&quot;I think that&#39;s my cue.&quot; Estelle, who had been silent and un-noticeable until this point, 
piqued up. &quot;If everyone would please leave the room so I could heal her.&quot;
Judith pointed to herself. &quot;Even me??&quot;
&quot;Yes, even you!&quot; Estelle grinned and slammed the door.
Yuri shivered slightly. &quot;I don&#39;t think I have ever seen the princess take charge so well. 
Meeting adjourned; be back here at sunset then.&quot;
Rita took a brief lapse in her pain and spoke up. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for running away.&quot;
&quot;Why did you run away anyway?&quot; She questioned curiously.
Rita averted her gaze and flushed slightly. &quot;Y-You don&#39;t wanna know.&quot;
&quot;Oh but I do,&quot; Estelle smiled, radiantly. That warm glowing smile, that smile that would 
make anyone fall in love with her.
Estelle became worried about the situation when Rita said nothing. &quot;What&#39;s wrong, Rita?&quot;
&quot;Besides my excruciating pain?&quot; Rita snickered the best she could in her condition.
&quot;Yes, besides that.&quot; Estelle&#39;s hand wiped Rita&#39;s bangs from her face.
Rita&#39;s body shook at Estelle&#39;s touch and her affectionate gaze. Rita leaned up and used her 
hands for balance. The mage pressed her lips to her Princess&#39;. Estelle&#39;s eyes went wide and 
she backed up with a flush. &quot;W-What was that for?&quot;
Rita smiled meekly.
&quot;Estelle, I thought that you were a friend to me, you&#39;re the first friend that I have ever 
had. I had thought I was just being clingy to you. It turns out that it was something more 
than that. Judith helped me understand that; I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry I ran away. I want nothing 
more than to be there for you from this day forward.&quot; Rita took a deep breath and sighed. 
&quot;When those men jumped me, before I passed out, I saw you. I thought I was never going to 
see you again.&quot; Rita admitted everything, poured her heart and soul out, and she hoped she 
would be accepted. If not, a hermit&#39;s life didn&#39;t sound so bad.
Estelle sat back down on the bed and rearranged herself to be behind Rita. Rita flushed 
slightly but didn&#39;t move. Only &#39;eeped&#39; when the princess snaked her arms around Rita&#39;s 
abdomen. Estelle&#39;s hands were gentle and softly ran along Rita. Rita&#39;s pain very slowly 
began to subside, much to her surprise. &quot;W-What are you doing Estelle?&quot; Rita questioned, and 
turned around to stare into Estelle&#39;s bright aqua eyes.
Estelle slid Rita&#39;s robe off of her shoulders, untying the front and pulling off her cloth 
belt. &quot;WHOA! Estelle! What are you doing!?&quot; Rita flushed and became flustered. &#39;This is what 
I want, so why am I being so defensive?&#39;
&quot;I&#39;m going to take a look over your body and make sure nothing is broken.&quot; Rita nodded 
disappointedly and shivered at Estelle&#39;s cool hands on her feverish skin. She didn&#39;t say 
anything about Rita&#39;s confession, perhaps she mulled it over in her head. Rita sighed, and 
flushed deeper when she noticed that nothing was covering her chest: from the waist up, Rita 
was totally exposed. She modestly tried to cover herself, but Estelle pushed her arms aside 
and wrapped her hands around Rita&#39;s waist, her dexterous fingers sliding up her abdomen to 
her breasts. Estelle gave a playful squeeze and trailed her fingers up to Rita&#39;s cheeks. 
Estelle turned her head to gaze at her face-to-face and pressed her lips to Rita&#39;s quivering 
ones.
Rita flushed and moved closer to Estelle, her hands instinctively wrapped around Estelle&#39;s 
neck; her soft rosy lips pressed against hers. Rita winced and pulled back slightly, her 
hand moved to her side. Estelle took notice and ran her hand gently over hers. &quot;Does this 
hurt?&quot; Rita only nodded. Estelle&#39;s hand started glowing as she ran it over Rita&#39;s side. Rita 
whimpered and squirmed as her bones began mending themselves. &quot;Shhh...&quot; Estelle smiled and 
cradled her against her breast. &quot;It will all be over in a minute.&quot; Rita whined and tried to 
push herself away. Estelle tightened her grip on Rita, pulling her closer to her body. Rita 
screamed bloody: it felt as if her bones broke and re-mended themselves a few hundred times 
in the space of a few minutes. Quite a few times, Rita had passed out and came through to a 
fire thatnipped at her wounds. A sudden relief washed over Rita when Estelle&#39;s hands dimmed. 
Completely and totally unfazed and unharmed. Nothing hurt anymore. It was frightening as 
hell and miraculous all at the same time.
&quot;You&#39;re mean,&quot; Rita pouted.
&quot;What did I do?&quot;
&quot;That hurt.&quot;
&quot;It wasn&#39;t supposed to tickle, you big baby.&quot; Estelle smiled and pulled Rita down to her on 
the bed. Rita turned herself around in Estelle&#39;s arms, and nuzzled against her cheek.
&quot;Why am I the girl?&quot; Rita pondered.
&quot;We&#39;re both girls, silly,&quot; Estelle giggled and kissed Rita once more. The kiss was deep this 
time, as Estelle&#39;s hand trailed down Rita&#39;s breast and her abdomen. Rita let out a small 
shriek and arched delightfully to Estelle&#39;s cool touch. The young mage let out a small moan 
as Estelle fingers softly probed at the apex of Rita&#39;s thighs. Small maneuvers and light 
touches at the top of Rita&#39;s thighs rewarded Estelle with a sharp moan of delight from Rita. 
Estelle&#39;s fingers probed her most intimate spot, causing the young mage to moan even sharper 
and flush.
&quot;Nnnnngh...Estelle, stop it,&quot; Rita moaned louder; Estelle&#39;s newly found lover&#39;s moans only 
set a spark ablaze in her and she probed her fingers deeper. Rita instinctively bucked her 
hips to the fingers that probed inside of her, her cries made Estelle shiver.
Rita moaned more but undid the buttons to Estelle&#39;s top. &quot;You&#39;re going to be...mmmm...mean, 
so will I.&quot; Rita pulled Estelle&#39;s top over her shoulders and down her arms, which left 
Estelle exposed as she was. Rita smiled deviously and began to kiss at Estelle&#39;s neck, 
suckling gently. Her hands moved to Estelle&#39;s moderately sized breasts, which were certainly 
larger than hers, anyway. Rita kissed her way down Estelle&#39;s chest, she kissed and licked at 
Estelle&#39;s breasts as the princess&#39; fingers probed Rita&#39;s very core. Estelle&#39;s hand ran 
through Rita&#39;s hair as the brunette mage tweaked the princess&#39; nipple in her fingers. Rita 
alternatively bit and lapped at the other hardening nub, Estelle gave aloud moan and 
shivered to her delights.
Rita shivered and shook violently as electric tingles ran up and down her spine. Estelle bit 
Rita&#39;s quivering bottom lip, and grinned mischievously as she began to work her fingers with 
a renewed fervor. Rita moved her leg and pushed the bottom of her thigh to the apex of 
Estelle&#39;s legs. Estelle moaned softly in Rita&#39;s ear, &quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; Estelle gasped shakily. Rita 
rubbed her thigh along Estelle&#39;s most private place, which earned a sharp gasp from the 
Princess. Rita took the initiative and kissed Estelle deeply, her tongue ran along Estelle&#39;s 
as both of their moans became muffled.
Rita cried out loudly, and bit on her own bottom lip to muffle her cries. &quot;Estelle...&quot; She 
breathed, Estelle knew exactly what the young witch was going to say. Estelle probed harder 
inside of her, she earned a loud and delighted shriek from Rita as she was pushed over her 
edge. Rita&#39;s body shivered and her juices overflowed down Estelle&#39;s hand.
&quot;You&#39;re quite the dirty little girl, Rita.&quot; Estelle giggled and purred softly into the young 
wizard&#39;s ear, only to then moan once more when the young mage started moving her leg again. 
Rita continued her assault on the Princess and added the motions of softly messaging her 
breasts. Rita heard Estelle moan and it made her shiver with delight and a renewed vigor. 
Rita softly palmed and pawed at Estelle&#39;s plump breasts, Rita kissed her once more as 
Estelle fell over the edge. Wave after wave of ecstatic pleasure washed over her as Rita 
reveled in her accomplishment.
&quot;I may be na&Atilde;&macr;ve, but I am no where near shy,&quot; She grinned to the young mage.
&quot;I noticed.&quot; Rita giggled, she slid down against her and wrapped her arms around Estelle&#39;s 
neck. &quot;I&#39;m all for this. Really I am, but do you think we might have moved things a little 
too fast?&quot;
&quot;What do you want Rita, do you want me to tell you, &quot;I Love You&quot;? You may not know it, but I 
do. I thought it was just friendship at first, but learned that I like you a little more 
than just a friend. A sister maybe, but I wouldn&#39;t want to do these things with a sister,&quot; 
Estelle flushed vividly and bit her lip.
Rita moved forward and patted her head, which ruffled her hair slightly. The brunette leaned 
forward and softly pressed her lips to Estelle&#39;s. Her hands cradled Estelle&#39;s cheeks, Rita 
slid her tongue along the Princess&#39; with a slight moan. Rita pushed her down to the bed and 
stared down into her shimmering aqua-green emeralds. &quot;What happened to slowing down a bit?&quot; 
Estelle questioned, pinned down by the 15 year old.
Rita shrugged and averted her gaze. &quot;I&#39;m sick of being shy and not taking what I want. When 
I was kidnapped, I didn&#39;t know what to do, I just wanted to run away, I don&#39;t think I 
could&#39;ve though. I&#39;m sick of not getting what I want because I&#39;m too meek and skittish to 
take control of my own desires. You know, you were the last thing I saw before I passed 
out,&quot; Rita sighs contently, staring down at the Princess&#39; aqua-green eyes. Estelle leaned up 
and licked her nose with a smile, catching Rita off guard.
&quot;Well, if you feel so strongly, then does it really matter if we do this?&quot; Estelle 
questioned.
&quot;I don&#39;t know; maybe we should wait. I don&#39;t want to feel like I&#39;m being rushed,&quot; Rita 
smiled. &quot;Besides it&#39;s not like we won&#39;t have time in the future, right?&quot; Rita smiled down to 
her and leaned down to kiss Estelle once. Rita held her down and kissed her deeper. Estelle 
wiggled and struggled to get the upper hand, she successfully rolled Rita over to be on her 
back, and pinned her to the bed instead. With a wide grin, Estelle kissed her deeper then 
Rita had kissed her before.
The young healer wrapped her arms around Rita&#39;s shoulders and pulled her closer, kissed her 
over and over again, and only parting lips with her when they needed a greedy gasp of air. 
Estelle ran her hands over the young girl&#39;s body, and intimately explored her new-found 
lover. Rita did the same, she ran her hands over the curve of Estelle&#39;s breasts and down her 
firm, shapely legs.
As she was carried out her ministrations, Rita&#39;s mind began to wander. &#39;What if she finds 
out about earlier? That would just ruin everything. Not that I really worked that hard, I 
just took advantage of the situation. I should just tell her, even if she thinks I&#39;m a 
horrible person,&#39; Rita bit her bottom lip as her expression became more nervous and anxious.
Rita stared down at the Estelle on her bed. &quot;I-I have a confession, b-back when you passed 
out, I...&quot; Rita took a deep breath and flushed crimson up to her ears. &quot;...I kind of took 
advantage of you.&quot;
Estelle mocked a gasp, and stuttered in a joking tone. &quot;Why Rita, how could you!?&quot;
Rita covered her face with her hands, on the verge of tears. &quot;I&#39;m sorry!&quot;
Estelle grinned and leaned down to Rita, her bangs running along the witch&#39;s forehead, and 
she placed a hand at the back of the young girl&#39;s neck. &quot;I know you did. I was awake the 
whole time.&quot;
&quot;W-What are you talking about!?&quot; Rita stammered, her voice cracked.
&quot;I was awake the whole time you were &#39;taking advantage of me,&#39;&quot; Estelle simply stated again.
&quot;What about the thing with Yuri barging in on you while you were changing?!&quot;
Estelle lightly pecked her young witch on the forehead. She sighed contently and rested her 
forehead to Rita&#39;s. &quot;The matter of Yuri barging through the door was staged.&quot; Estelle 
giggled and winked to Rita. &quot;I&#39;m a pretty good actress, aren&#39;t I?&quot;
Rita just started to laugh so hard, she broke down into tears, and eventually collapsed into 
Estelle&#39;s arms. &quot;S-So who...planned this all?&quot;
&quot;Judith did.&quot; Estelle rebutted.
The blue haired elf, whom stood at the outside of the door, slightly smiled to herself. She 
walked down the stairs, out of the inn, and into her lover&#39;s arms. He pulled her close and 
kissed her under the radiant moonlight, their gods blessed them with the ethereal light of 
the stars.
