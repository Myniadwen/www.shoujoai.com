<h1>True Healing</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../fftactics/index.html">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/grandmoff.html">GrandMoff</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&#147;No!&#148;  The young blonde&#146;s shrill cry hung in the damp night air.  She 
sat bolt upright, wide-eyed on her bed.  She was panicked from her 
latest nightmare.  She saw nothing but the phantoms around her.

She felt a calloused but gentle hand on her shoulder.  The touch 
rescued her from her demons and her vision cleared.  The slim woman 
wrestled her hysteria back easily, now that she had something real to 
anchor herself against.  Though she still had tears blurring her 
sight, she recognized her salvation.  &#147;Reis,&#148; she said quietly.  
&#147;Thank you, Reis.&#148;

The tall mistress of dragons smiled concernedly at her charge.  She 
didn&#146;t speak-Reis never spoke-but her presence was comforting.  The 
powerful brunette leaned down and wiped the tears from her friend&#146;s 
face.  Friend?  Yes, definitely, Reis was a true friend, even though 
she didn&#146;t talk.

Alma thought back to the event of a few months ago.  She and her 
brother had been on the run from just about everybody.  Alma had tried 
her best to help her friend, Princess Ovelia, and the princess&#146;s 
defenders.  But Alma wasn&#146;t a fighter.  She supported the warriors: 
her brother Ramza, Ovelia&#146;s champion Agrias, &#147;Thunder God Cid&#148; 
Orlandu, Mustadio, and various lesser knights.  She remembered running 
northeast with the party.  There they met the hunter, Beowulf and his 
companion, the Holy Dragon, Reis.  Alma&#146;s mystical vision had shown 
her the beast&#146;s strange nature.  Ramza, Reis, and Beowulf had sought 
and found the stone that would restore Reis to her true self.  Alma 
had performed the ritual.  Her mind had nearly burst with all the 
warring emotions she&#146;d felt.  What if it didn&#146;t work?  What if Lucavi 
showed up, thanks to the stone?  What if Reis herself attacked Alma?  
What if Reis didn&#146;t survive the transformation?

The return to her human body had been painful, Alma could tell, but 
Reis had never made a sound.  She&#146;d fallen naked to the cavern floor 
and Alma had quickly given her the extra clothing she&#146;d known she 
would need.  When Reis had pulled herself together, she&#146;d risen 
slowly.  She&#146;d ignored the clothes momentarily in order to give Alma a 
bone-crushing hug.  As Alma had been swept from her feet, she&#146;d 
marveled at Reis&#146;s strength.  The tall woman seemed to have retained 
all her draconian muscle power.  Then Reis had gotten dressed and the 
two had joined their companions.

Life had proceeded.  There had been more fighting, investigating, and 
fleeing.  Then Alma had been caught.  For a short while, she&#146;d been 
scared, but she soon realized that she was safe.  The bad side and the 
good side both wanted her alive.

Ramza had eventually caught up with her captors.  Just when it seemed 
that her friends would win the day, Alma had been unwillingly 
transmuted.  Powerful magic had warped her.  Part of her fought.  The 
other part of her watched in horror.  Alma&#146;s body, manipulated by 
Lucavi, had struck ferociously at the heroes.  She dealt Orlandu a 
particularly savage blow and he fell hard.  He lay still.

Alma was strong enough to force her possessed body to slow itself.  
Reis summoned her holy power and focused it on Alma.  Together, Reis 
and Alma exorcised Alma&#146;s body.

When Lucavi fled, Alma lapsed into deep sleep.

She awoke the next evening.  Ramza had told her what had happened.  
The news had nearly broken Alma, but her surviving comrades had 
consoled her.  Orlandu was dead.  Agrias was dead.  The group was 
still on the run from the Church.  Delita was officially a scumbucket 
who&#146;d managed to become king and was going to marry Ovelia.  Her best 
friend, married to that cold-hearted butcher: it couldn&#146;t be right.  
The mighty T. G. Cid and Agrias, the rock of faithfulness, both gone: 
it was too awful to be true.  Victory was supposed to be much better 
than this.

That was before the Church had struck at them in the dead of night.  
Everyone had fled.  The party that had just saved Ivalice was 
scattered.  Who could say what had become of the lost ones?

For some reason, Reis had run with Alma.  They had broken free of the 
trap and they had kept running for a fortnight.  They lost themselves 
in Zarghidas Trade City.

There were plenty of reasons that Alma stopped there.  She was tired 
of running.  She truly doubted that anyone could find them in such a 
big place.  If she had any hope of seeing her friends again, she 
needed to stay put and keep her eyes and ears open.  And Zarghidas was 
a nice city; it was large, but most of it was new.  There were no 
slums.  Most of the people were friendly.  Zarghidas had work, too, 
and a lot of immigrants.

On the pair&#146;s third day in the city, Reis had awakened early and led 
Alma to the largest bestiary in Zarghidas.  A manager had met them 
both and set them to work as if he&#146;d been expecting them, which he 
had.  Alma was at a loss.  She had no idea how, but Reis had gotten 
them employed.  Alma was assisting the animals&#146; healer.  Reis, Alma 
soon discovered, was handling dangerous creatures.  It was the perfect 
job for her; animals-especially dragons-loved Reis.

The days passed; life and its injustices continued.  The days weren&#146;t 
bad, but the nights&#133;Alma often dreamed about her helpless horror as 
she slaughtered Orlandu.

Which was exactly how tonight had been.

And now Reis had come to comfort her, as she always did.  The dragoner 
calmed Alma well, though she never spoke.  She merely comforted with a 
reassuring touch.  She made Alma feel safe.  Her physical presence, 
while formidable, was only a small portion of her soothing influence.  
The majority was her aura of serenity and empathy.  Alma couldn&#146;t help 
but feel that Reis must be going through hell, separated from Beowulf 
as she was.

&#147;Can you speak?&#148; Alma asked timidly.

Reis nodded slowly.

&#147;Why don&#146;t you?&#148;

The woman&#146;s chestnut hair bounced as she shook her head.  She pointed 
at herself.  She made a very frightened face.  Then she pointed at her 
friend.  Alma understood.

&#147;You think you would scare me?&#148;

Reis nodded with a grimace.

Alma was touched and saddened by this.  Reis wasn&#146;t talking for her 
sake.  &#147;You wouldn&#146;t scare me,&#148; the cleric said.  &#147;I promise you 
wouldn&#146;t.  I know the compassionate person you are.  Please speak to 
me, Reis.&#148;

Reis shook her head emphatically.

Alma realized that she was about to start crying again if this kept 
up.  She took Reis&#146;s right hand in her two much smaller hands.  She 
looked into Reis&#146;s wintry grey eyes.  &#147;Please,&#148; she entreated.

Reis shut her eyelids.  Alma had never seen her cry.  Reis wouldn&#146;t 
let it happen now.  She clapped her hands over her ears and pointed at 
Alma.  She opened her eyes again.  The young healer had not covered 
her ears.

&#147;You wouldn&#146;t hurt me,&#148; Alma stated.

Reis took a deep breath.  &#147;True,&#148; she rumbled.  Her voice was 
bestial-the perilous growl of a dragon.

Alma winced at the sound for only an instant.  &#147;H-how did you&#133;get this 
problem?&#148; the blonde woman stammered.

Reis answered as quietly as she could.  Her voice was a menacing 
rumble, but Alma fought back her instinctive dragonfear.  &#147;Only thing 
that stayed dragon.&#148;

&#147;What?  But I performed the ritual.  Was my faith so weak?&#148;

&#147;Not your fault,&#148; Reis accidentally roared in her haste to correct 
Alma.  &#147;Mine.  I was not calm.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry, Reis,&#148; Alma said quietly.  She impulsively gave her friend 
a quick hug.  &#147;I&#146;ll heal you.  On my honor, I will.&#148;

Alma had a greater purpose in her life once more.  She spent nearly 
all her time working or looking for a way to fulfill her oath.  She 
would restore Reis&#146;s voice as soon as she knew how to do it.  Okay, 
she didn&#146;t spend all her time looking for a cure.  She did most of the 
cooking for Reis and herself.  Every few days, she took Reis to a 
restaurant or out to the shops or to a play or to do 
something-anything-fun.  Alma figured that they needed fun, to counter 
the hardships they faced.

It had been a few weeks when Alma came across a book that offered a 
solution.  She kept reading feverishly.  There might be hope-

&#147;-We&#146;re closing, Miss,&#148; the shopkeeper said.

&#147;How much is this book?&#148; Alma asked.

&#147;1500 gil, Miss,&#148; the proprietor answered.  &#147;I&#146;m sorry, but it is a 
very rare manuscript.&#148;

Alma knew she couldn&#146;t really afford it, but it was for Reis, Reis to 
whom she owed so much.  &#147;I can give you 1100 for it,&#148; Alma offered.

&#147;It cost me more than that,&#148; the shopkeeper protested.

&#147;All right, I&#146;ll give you 1270 gil.  It&#146;s all I&#146;ve got.&#148;

The shopkeeper smiled kindly at her.  &#147;All you&#146;ve got?  You may have 
it for 1100.&#148;

Heart pounding with excitement, Alma burst through the apartment door.  
She almost blurted everything to Reis, but she stopped herself.  What 
if she couldn&#146;t cure Reis after all?  It was better to wait and tell 
Reis when she was sure.  The last thing Alma would ever want to do 
would be to raise Reis&#146;s hopes and then dash them into bits.  I&#146;d 
rather die than cause her pain, Alma thought fiercely.  I&#146;ll tell her 
when I&#146;m certain, and only then.

Alma wanted to keep reading right then, but she helped Reis make 
supper instead.  Alma didn&#146;t mind hearing Reis&#146;s monstrous voice, but 
she knew that Reis wasn&#146;t comfortable with speaking, so Alma ran most 
of the conversation.

&#147;Did you have a good day?&#148; she asked her tall friend.

Reis nodded eagerly.

&#147;Good.  So did I.  We had a couple of sick red chocobos but two of my 
restoring draughts helped them greatly.  The healer told me that I&#146;m 
the best assistant she&#146;s ever had.&#148;

Reis beamed at her.  Encouraged, Alma continued.  &#147;I also had a chat 
with your supervisor.  He told me that you&#146;ve taught him more in the 
last two months than he&#146;s learned during the whole rest of his life.  
He thinks you&#146;re a godsend.  I told him that he was absolutely right.&#148;

Reis blushed heavily at the praise.  Despite her embarrassment, she 
kept her stormy grey eyes fastened on Alma&#146;s sparkling blue eyes.  For 
the first time in ages, Reis was genuinely happy.

The day had been long, but Alma forced herself to stay awake and 
finish reading the possible remedy for her friend&#146;s condition.  It 
seemed like a long shit, but it would be easy enough to try the cure.  
There was nothing to lose by trying.  We will make our attempt 
tomorrow then, Alma decided.  She slipped into a peaceful sleep.

It was still dark when Alma was startled awake.  She heard a loud 
growl.  For an instant, she panicked.  Then she thought of Reis.  It 
must be her, and she sounded scared; and it&#146;s not easy to scare a 
dragon, Alma realized fearfully.  Maybe we&#146;ve been found?  She rushed 
to Reis&#146;s room.

She&#146;d been ready for almost anything, but not for what she saw.  Reis 
was thrashing and rumbling.  Her eyes were open, but she was obviously 
asleep and terrified.  Reis, the brave warrior; Reis, the strongest 
person Alma knew; Reis, the only woman she&#146;d ever known who was a 
match for Orlandu; mighty Reis was having a nightmare.  She was just a 
human, the same as Alma.

Alma fairly flew to Reis&#146;s side.  The panic that the dragon&#146;s growl 
evoked was many times more powerful than it had been when Reis spoke 
with Alma, because Reis had been purposely staying as quiet as she 
could.  Alma&#146;s concern easily overwhelmed even this tremendous fear.  
In a flash, the blond woman was next to her friend.  She put a 
determined hand on Reis&#146;s shoulder.  &#147;It&#146;s a bad dream, that&#146;s all.  
Wake up!  It&#146;s only a dream.&#148;

Reis jolted.  Her eyes focused and the fear left them.  She grew aware 
of Alma&#146;s support.  Tears welled in her eyes and her lower lip began 
to quiver.

She&#146;s still fighting, still trying to be strong for me, Alma thought 
fondly.  She embraced Reis with her warm, slender arms and laid the 
dragoner&#146;s head on her shoulder.  &#147;It&#146;s okay to cry,&#148; she whispered.  
&#147;I know you&#146;re strong.  Let it out, Reis.  I&#146;m with you.&#148;

Grief, happiness, pain, frustration, and many other tangled emotions 
poured from Reis.  Small, gentle Alma braced her as she sobbed.  The 
young healer had never heard a dragon cry.  It was such a poignant 
sound that Alma couldn&#146;t be afraid; she could only be sympathetic.

&#147;I feel better,&#148; Reis sniffed at last.

&#147;I&#146;m glad,&#148; Alma responded.  &#147;I know I&#146;ve only been a burden-&#147;

&#147;-No!&#148; Reis contradicted.  &#147;A blessing.  A true friend.&#148;

&#147;As have you,&#148; Alma said, though her throat was choked with sudden 
emotion.  She held onto Reis for a while longer.

The following day seemed pretty normal, not that Alma had much to 
compare a normal day with.  She had a few injuries to mend, the worst 
of which was an uribo&#146;s shattered knee.  She did her work quickly and 
proficiently.  Reis&#146;s day was more eventful but still rather ordinary.  
Some extremely rude customers had irritated a pregnant hyudra; Reis 
had soothed the angry creature before she&#146;d slaughtered the offenders.  
Reis&#146;s boss had been duly impressed again.  Normally, such fools 
would&#146;ve been lunchmeat, no matter who tried to help.

Alma could barely contain her excited anxiety as she walked with Reis 
back to the apartment.  Once there, she cleared her throat.  Reis 
looked at her expectantly.

&#147;I may have found a way to heal you,&#148; Alma announced, keeping her 
voice as even as she could.  Reis&#146;s face glowed with hope.  Alma 
continued, &#147;According to an old text, the problem is in your memory.  
What I need to do is enter your mind through meditation and alter your 
memory of the ritual.  All you need to do is concentrate on something 
else, preferably something happy.  It shouldn&#146;t take too long.&#148;

Both women took deep breaths.  Reis looked calm; Alma admired her once 
again.  The healer herself was as nervous as could be.  She and Reis 
sat on the carpet and placed their palms together.

&#147;Are you ready?&#148; the young mystic asked.

Reis nodded.  She held her strong chin high.

&#147;Let&#146;s begin,&#148; Alma said firmly.  She let her faith guide her toward 
the mind of the woman with the chestnut hair.  Her faith and willpower 
were quite potent.  She glided easily through Reis&#146;s subconscious 
mind.  She ignored all but her objective.  She wanted to respect her 
friend&#146;s privacy and do her &#147;repairs&#148; as soon as she could so that 
Reis wouldn&#146;t have to strain herself with concentration.  There was 
the scene.  The dream Alma was praying hard.  The present Alma flitted 
into the chamber with Reis.  She spoke in a pacifying manner.  
&#147;Everything will be okay.  You have never been a dragon, Reis; even 
now, you are a woman.  Believe in yourself.  Have no fear.&#148;

Incredibly, Alma heard the dream-dragon Reis&#146;s thoughts.  &#147;Please stay 
with me until the ritual is complete,&#148; she implored.

&#147;All right,&#148; Alma conceded.

Alma stood with the dream-dragon until she heard her dream-self call 
Reis&#146;s name.  &#147;You&#146;ll be fine now,&#148; Alma said.  Dream-Reis, now a 
human, smiled.  &#147;I will always be with you.&#148;  With that promise, Alma 
left Reis&#146;s mind.

Alma opened her eyes to see Reis grinning beatifically at her.  She 
stayed quiet.  Alma couldn&#146;t bear the maddening silence.

&#147;Come on, Reis!  Did it work?&#148;

The tall brunette helped Alma to her feet.  &#147;It did,&#148; she stated.  
Alma had never heard anything so wonderful.  Reis&#146;s voice was low and 
melodious and full of power, just as her body and mind were.

&#147;Oh Reis, I&#146;m so happy!&#148; Alma cried.  &#147;Come on, let&#146;s put on some nice 
clothes and celebrate!&#148;

Alma was positively giddy with their victory.  She dressed in a white 
blouse with embroidered orchids and lotuses; a knee-length, mint blue 
skirt with a black lace hem; lavender, calf-high socks; black, 
open-toed shoes with eight-centimeter heels; and silken lavender 
gloves.  She tied a violet scarf into a bow in her hair.  Using a 
little bit of magic, she put a few gorgeous streaks of rosy pink into 
her blonde hair.  She felt ready.  Well, mostly ready-she also felt a 
tad nervous.  I guess I&#146;m just being silly, Alma admonished herself.  
She knocked on Reis&#146;s door.

&#147;Nearly ready,&#148; Reis called.  &#147;Just give me one more minute.&#148;

&#147;Take your time,&#148; Alma said glibly.  She began pacing, then noticed 
what she was doing and stopped.  This isn&#146;t like me, she thought.  
I&#146;ve got to-

--She heard the doorknob turn.  Her heart leapt up to just beneath her 
mouth and decided to stay there until further notice.  Reis was 
standing in the doorway.  She was wearing a light blue, long-sleeved 
blouse with a navy blue vest that was fastened with three silver 
buttons.  She had on loose white satin slacks that billowed around her 
legs with every movement.  She&#146;d piled up her long, chestnut hair and 
held it in place with two combs, one of cherry wood and one of cedar.  
This left her slender neck bare except for a blood-red cotton choker 
that was tied with a small bow.  She looked into Alma&#146;s eyes and gave 
her a crooked little grin.

Alma felt heat rush to her cheeks.  &#147;Y-you look great,&#148; she told Reis 
candidly.  &#147;Wow.  You really look lovely.&#148;

&#147;Thank you, Alma,&#148; Reis said with a blush of her own.  &#147;You look 
rather enchanting yourself.&#148;

&#147;Shall we?&#148; Alma invited.  She had a MagiCab already waiting outside.  
She and Reis clambered into the vehicle and rode to the classiest 
section of the city.  They arrived at the restaurant in just a few 
minutes.  Alma insisted that she was paying for everything, so Reis 
was left to simply enjoy herself.  Small, multi-colored globes gave 
soft light; wonderful scents and relaxing music drifted through the 
air; everyone was friendly; the food was outstanding.  To Reis, the 
capper was the company; she couldn&#146;t ask for better than the bright 
young woman with her.

An urge that Reis couldn&#146;t suppress suddenly made the dragon mistress 
stand and extend her hand to Alma.  &#147;Dance with me?&#148; she asked shyly.  
She felt Alma&#146;s small, gloved hand in her own as the blonde woman 
mutely accepted.

Reis guided Alma to the dance floor.  At first, she led, moving with a 
grace that surprised even her.  The pair complemented each other 
flawlessly, almost as though they shared a psychic bond.  During the 
slow songs, Alma took the lead; Reis led during the faster songs.  
Alma pirouetted with careless abandon, her long pink and blonde hair 
making her resemble a sparkling comet that revolved around Reis.  
Dancing with Reis felt natural and satisfying.  Alma loved the paradox 
of being free in Reis&#146;s strong arms.  The happy duo kept dancing until 
there was no more music.  Alma and Reis reluctantly returned to their 
table.

Alma ordered a raspberry tart for dessert and she and Reis shared it.  
The waitress came over and gave Alma the bill.  Reis could have sworn 
that the girl winked at Alma, but it was over so quickly that she 
couldn&#146;t be sure.  Nonetheless, the look struck a jealous chord in 
Reis&#146;s heart.  She didn&#146;t know why&#133;but it had happened.  Reis would 
not deny it.  In the meantime, Alma paid the bill.  Then she and Reis 
rode back to their apartment.  Reis thought Alma looked a little 
preoccupied.

They got into the small apartment and Alma magically brought up the 
lights.  She turned to look at Reis.

Both women started talking at once.  They laughed.  &#147;You go first,&#148; 
Reis offered.

&#147;I had a great time tonight,&#148; Alma confided.  &#147;You made me feel 
special.&#148;

Reis swallowed hard.  &#147;I just want to thank you, Alma.  And not just 
for the dinner; I have to thank you for the dance, too.&#148;

Alma turned crimson.  &#147;You&#146;re a great dancer,&#148; she said embarrassedly.  
&#147;I&#146;m glad you asked me.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;ve done so much for me,&#148; Reis began.  &#147;I&#146;ll never be able to 
repay you.  Thanks to you, I can talk again.  You told me to think of 
something happy while you restored my voice.&#148;  The woman with the 
chestnut hair looked at Alma with shining eyes.  &#147;I thought of being 
with you, Alma.&#148;

&#147;You did?&#148; Alma squeaked.  She smoothed her hair self-consciously, 
averting her eyes from Reis&#146;s penetrating gaze.  &#147;But I&#146;m so small and 
weak and-&#147;

&#147;-Loving,&#148; Reis interjected.  &#147;Wise.&#148;  She stepped toward Alma 
deliberately.  &#147;Courageous.&#148;  She gently placed her hands on Alma&#146;s 
face.  Alma closed her eyes.  &#147;Generous.&#148;  Reis kissed Alma&#146;s brow.  
&#147;Beautiful.&#148;  Reis kissed Alma&#146;s cheeks.  &#147;Angelic.&#148;  Reis boldly 
kissed Alma&#146;s mouth.

The blonde and pink-haired woman returned the kiss with vehement 
passion.  She moved her hands slowly up and down Reis&#146;s smooth back.  
She poured her love into Reis.  Abruptly, she pulled away from the 
taller woman.

&#147;Reis,&#148; she said with quiet intensity, &#147;don&#146;t do this if you don&#146;t 
mean it.&#148;

&#147;No worries, darling,&#148; Reis answered.  She leaned forward and kissed 
Alma again.

Alma leaned harder, pressing into Reis&#146;s muscular body.  She guided 
the dragon mistress steadily backward until she fell into a chair.  
Alma followed very closely, straddling the tall woman, still kissing 
her hungrily.  Her hands roved along Reis&#146;s sides, grabbed Reis&#146;s 
blouse and tugged hard, untucking the shirt.  She deftly unbuttoned 
the vest and blouse with quick, certain twitches of her fingers.  Alma 
took the kiss even deeper.  She slid the loose garments over Reis&#146;s 
shoulders and pulled her arms free of the sleeves.

Reis was breathing more and more heavily.  Alma&#146;s gloved fingers 
glided tortuously over her exposed chest.  She was malleable in Alma&#146;s 
hands-not limp, but willing and responsive.  She let Alma do whatever 
she wanted to do.  Alma took the license and used it to the fullest.  
She wriggled her hips on Reis&#146;s lap and unfastened Reis&#146;s slacks.  
Both women were surprised and excited at Alma&#146;s aggressive behavior.  
The way Reis moved her tongue in Alma&#146;s mouth encouraged her to keep 
going.  She put her hands up to Reis&#146;s head and withdrew the two 
combs.  Reis&#146;s chestnut mane tumbled around the amorous couple in 
waves of exquisite beauty.  Alma&#146;s breath caught.  She finally pried 
her lips from Reis&#146;s mouth.  She brushed the long hair from Reis&#146;s ear 
and kissed it delicately.  &#147;You&#146;re the most gorgeous sight I&#146;ve ever 
seen,&#148; Alma whispered.  She shifted slightly and kissed Reis&#146;s other 
ear.  &#147;I&#146;m in love with you,&#148; she murmured.  Reis knew that it was 
true.

&#147;I&#133;love you&#133;Alma,&#148; Reis panted as she squirmed beneath Alma&#146;s busy 
lips and fingers.

Alma reverently lifted Reis&#146;s hand and kissed it.  She traveled 
tenderly up Reis&#146;s arm.  &#147;Your freckles are so adorable,&#148; Alma said as 
she kissed Reis&#146;s shoulder.

&#147;You&#146;re too sweet,&#148; Reis sighed.

Suddenly, Alma slipped from Reis&#146;s lap and dropped to her knees.  Reis 
missed her already, but not for long.  Alma&#146;s small hands gripped her 
buttocks and scooted her forward on the chair.  She brushed her lips 
across Reis&#146;s abdomen.  The touch was lighter than a faint breeze, but 
Reis felt it in every cell of her body.  Whether she meant to or not, 
Alma was teasing her unbearably.  The dragoner&#146;s eyelids fluttered.  
Alma stroked her ribs and began licking her belly button.  &#147;Mm&#133;more,&#148; 
Reis whimpered.

Alma&#146;s hands went to Reis&#146;s waist.  The tall brunette lifted herself 
off the chair for a moment and let Alma pull the voluminous pants over 
her hips, down to her ankles, and then completely off.  Alma&#146;s mouth 
flew to Reis&#146;s abdomen again.  Reis sighed with frustrated pleasure.  
At last, Alma began her slow journey south, every second seeming like 
days of splendid, excruciating, delicious waiting.  She ached in 
anticipation.  Alma loved her.  Alma wouldn&#146;t keep her from her 
release.  Alma-

--touched the tip of her tongue to Reis&#146;s swollen, damp clitoris.  
Reis screeched, rocking her hips convulsively against Alma&#146;s lips and 
tongue.  Alma obliged Reis&#146;s unspoken wish and pushed her tongue into 
the powerful woman as far as she could.  Reis screamed in ecstasy, 
calling Alma&#146;s name again and again until she had no breath left.  
Alma kept lapping at her vagina, wanting every drop of tangy fluid 
that her beloved had to offer.

After Reis had come several times, Alma had drunk her fill and lifted 
her head from between Reis&#146;s trembling legs.  She looked into Reis&#146;s 
eyes and saw fulfilled dreams.  It made her feel warm and happy to see 
that.  She stood and straddled Reis&#146;s lap again.  The dragon 
mistress&#146;s eyes were still shut tightly and she was gulping air as if 
she hadn&#146;t breathed in hours.  Alma kissed her neck and ears while 
Reis recovered from her numerous consecutive orgasms.  Alma 
nonchalantly played with Reis&#146;s nipples, enjoying the taller woman&#146;s 
yelps of protest.

Reis finally regained her strength and swatted Alma&#146;s hands away from 
her chest.  &#147;How did you do that?&#148; she asked her blonde lover.  &#147;How 
did you make me feel so great?&#148;

&#147;I wanted you to know I love you,&#148; Alma said seriously.

Reis melted.  &#147;Alma,&#148; she breathed in a husky voice.  She put her arms 
around the young healer and kissed her affectionately.  Alma felt her 
body growing warmer as Reis&#146;s hands ran through her fine hair.  Reis 
turned Alma so she was sitting sideways across her legs.  Then she 
lifted the petite woman, cradling her in her arms.  Alma was again 
impressed at Reis&#146;s strength; Reis was carrying her the way she might 
a small child.  But Alma&#146;s feeling of security changed to excited glee 
when Reis set her gently on her bed.

&#147;Now let me show you my love,&#148; Reis whispered.  She slipped her hands 
underneath Alma&#146;s skirt, grabbed her skimpy panties, and yanked them 
off the smaller woman&#146;s body.  Alma gasped at the quickness and power 
in the action.  Reis pulled Alma&#146;s blouse up and off her without even 
undoing the clasps.  The dragoner paused involuntarily.  A slim gold 
chain with a tiny golden chocobo charm encircled Alma&#146;s flat abdomen.  
Thoroughly distracted, Reis put her hand beneath the chain and 
caressed Alma&#146;s smooth belly.

&#147;I can&#146;t tell you how beautiful you are,&#148; Reis said, &#147;but just looking 
at you nearly breaks my heart.&#148;

&#147;Reis, my love&#133;&#148; Alma said as tears formed in her eyes.

Reis massaged Alma&#146;s small, firm breasts.  She licked along each of 
Alma&#146;s ribs, producing shrill cries of joy from the slim blonde.  Reis 
grinned and pushed Alma&#146;s frilly lavender bra over her breasts.  She 
felt Alma&#146;s nipples rise, begging for attention.  Reis toyed with one 
with her fingers and closed her lips around the other.

&#147;Oh, yes!  Reis!&#148; Alma shouted.  Reis let the sounds spur her on.  She 
let her free hand wander over Alma&#146;s stomach, then her hips, then her 
thighs, finally over her puffy vulvae.  Alma was more vocal than ever, 
but not even close to coherent.  Reis sucked hard on one of Alma&#146;s 
nipples.  She slowly worked her middle finger into her young lover.  
Reis kept the penetration very shallow at first; she was getting an 
excellent reaction from her probing.  Slowly though, the dragon 
mistress pushed deeper.

With amazement, she met resistance that had to be Alma&#146;s hymen.  This 
was sacred territory.  Reis kept her finger moving but was careful to 
remain shallow.

Alma understood.  She opened her eyes and raised her head with great 
effort.  &#147;I need&#133;you&#133;in me&#133;Reis,&#148; she moaned.

&#147;But, you&#146;re a virgin, Alma.  If I go any further-&#147;

&#147;-Do it!  I&#133;want you&#133;deep&#133;inside&#133;me!  Please!  Reis!&#148;

Reis didn&#146;t dare believe her ears.  This lovely woman who lay below 
her was asking her to take her innocence.  &#147;It will hurt,&#148; Reis 
warned.  She somehow kept her voice steady.

&#147;I know.  I need&#133;you&#133;to&#133;make me&#133;yours.&#148;

Gladness trickled from Reis&#146;s eyes.  She used her dragon ability to 
blow icy breath on Alma&#146;s nipples, drawing her attention away from the 
act she was about to perform.  She thrust her finger hard into Alma&#146;s 
vagina.  Pain and pleasure mixed in Alma&#146;s mind, threatening to 
overwhelm her.  She held her breath unintentionally.  Reis kept moving 
her finger, plunging into Alma at an increasing tempo.  Alma 
shuddered, feeling the pain shrink and the pleasure expand.  Reis felt 
Alma relaxing again, so she stuck another finger into her tight 
opening.  Alma screamed and started humping Reis&#146;s hand as forcefully 
as she could.  Reis rubbed Alma&#146;s chest and twirled her fingers inside 
the blonde cleric.  It wouldn&#146;t be long now.

&#147;Reis!&#148; Alma yelled from the top of her lungs.  Her entire body rose 
off the bed; she clamped her legs around Reis&#146;s hand; she gushed 
sticky liquid like a small waterfall.  Reis did her best to keep her 
fingers in motion through the duration of Alma&#146;s climax.  For her 
part, Alma kept coming, her voice reaching ear-splitting volume, her 
body shuddering for long minutes.  Her muscles strained as she leapt 
from pinnacle to pinnacle.  She felt that she could ask for no more 
from this life.  Eventually, her fatigued thighs released Reis&#146;s hand 
and she lay limply on the bed.  Skyrockets and pinwheels danced 
through her mind.

She felt the soft pressure of Reis&#146;s full lips on her own.  Reis&#146;s 
strong arms clasped her in a warm embrace.  As well as she could, Alma 
returned the hug and the kiss.  The lovers lay that way for a long 
time.

&#147;Reis,&#148; Alma said through her euphoria, &#147;is there nothing you can&#146;t 
do?&#148;

Reis giggled like a young girl.  &#147;I should ask you that.&#148;

&#147;I love you with all that I am, Reis,&#148; Alma sighed contentedly.  
&#147;Thank you for making me a woman.&#148;

Reis blushed heavily.  &#147;Perhaps, when you&#146;re ready&#133;you could do the 
same for me?&#148; she asked in an adorably bashful tone.

Alma sat up in startled puzzlement, stifling a groan at the exertion.  
&#147;What are you saying?  I thought you&#133;and Beowulf&#133;&#148;

Reis laughed gaily.  &#147;No!  Oh, Alma!  Beowulf is my uncle.  He took 
care of me after my parents died.  That&#146;s why he&#146;s so protective of 
me.&#148;

&#147;Oh, I&#146;m sorry.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t be,&#148; Reis said.  She wrapped a pink lock of Alma&#146;s hair around 
her finger.  &#147;I&#146;ve made peace with their loss.  And I can see how 
you&#146;d misinterpret my relationship with Beowulf; we are very close, 
after all.&#148;

&#147;Reis, you&#146;re wonderful.&#148;

&#147;I love you, Alma.&#148;

The two women lay intertwined, enjoying the contentment that love 
brings.  &#147;Will you sleep with me?&#148; Alma asked quietly.  &#147;Maybe we can 
guard each other&#146;s dreams.&#148;

&#147;Oh, Alma,&#148; Reis breathed.  She laid her head in the blonde woman&#146;s 
lap.  &#147;Of course.  I would do anything for you.  I would love to sleep 
in your arms.&#148;

&#147;I-I think we ought to use my bed tonight,&#148; Alma said with an 
irresistible smile.  &#147;Yours seems to be a little damp.&#148;

Reis and Alma laughed for a long time.</pre>
