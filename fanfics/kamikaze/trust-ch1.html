<h1>Trust</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kamikaze/index.html">Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mysticmew.html">MysticMew</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Foreword

This has got be one of the weirdest things I&#39;ve done so far. Either 
you are going to hate or love this one. This story is based on the 
anime version of Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne and I really doubt someone 
ever did the pairing (seriously that is). Actually I have other 
priorities that I should take care of but my muse has been bugging me 
about this, so... It was meant to be SHORT but actually it&#39;s more, 
well, average. A one-shot for now, who knows about later.
Considering the theme of the story this might be somewhat... 
controversial in terms of pairing, so only read if you have an open 
mind about such things and don&#39;t come crying to me that you haven&#39;t 
been warned. Read at your own risk.
This takes place after Episode 33 where Chiaki reveals himself as 
Kaitou Sindbad to Maron and includes the setting of Episode 34 but 
goes differently from there. I&#39;ve been watching the rerun lately and I 
suppose that&#39;s where most of the inspiration came from. I did see/read 
both anime/manga but this story is following anime plotline.

Alright fine, the title isn&#39;t the coolest most innovative but it cuts 
to the points and to the general message delivered here.

And lastly, an archiving note.
The general rating of the story has morphed while writing into 
something more between PG-13 and R with a short section that is NC-17. 
Archives that do not support this rating (ff.net *cough*) will receive 
the censored version without that section, for everyone else the NC-17 
section is clearly indicated and can be ignored if wished. It&#39;s only 
remotely plot-relevant.

******************************

	Why? How could he have done that to her? She had thought... had 
thought...
	Kusakabe Maron sat hunched against the hall of her apartment, 
knees drawn tightly against herself and arms around them and her 
entire body. She was frantically fighting for control over her 
emotions... and she was losing. The brown-haired girl knew very well 
that she was losing. She could feel the cold bitter pain under the 
surface, the familiar feelings she thought to have finally banished by 
the persistent efforts of a single, annoying but yet well-meaning, 
boy... or so she had thought.
	Chiaki was Sindbad. Sindbad who had been sent by the Devil to... 
to... Well, she wasn&#39;t sure what for exactly but it surely wasn&#39;t 
anything good. At least that is what Fin had said and why should she 
believe someone she barely knew and who constantly had rivaled her for 
the demons she sought to capture over her best friend in the world?
	&#39;Why was I so dumb to trust him? That&#39;s what you get for wanting 
to trust someone for once, Maron!&#39; she reprimanded herself. It was so 
stupid. She had believed him, she had wanted to believe him... A part 
of her still wanted to believe him. After all just a few minutes ago 
he had been pounding on her door, pleading with her to hear him out, 
and after that failed he phoned her and repeated the same plea over 
her answering machine...
	Maron was confused about what she should think but most of all 
she was hurt. Her trust had been broken, the ray of hope had been 
snapped, again, just like always when she dared to trust someone she 
dearly loved. The only one she could trust was herself. A while ago 
she had been certain to always include Fin in this list but recently 
even that trust had diminished. Where was she now? Now when she really 
needed her. It was supposed to only be a week...
	Silent tears were beginning to flow from the distraught girl&#39;s 
face, her heart aching and her mind a jumble of confusing thoughts 
that made no sense to her. She needed someone to talk to... but no one 
was there. And who could she tell about this other than Fin without 
giving away her secret. No one. It was like always... she was all 
alone.

******************************

	Toudaiji Miyako halted suddenly in her tracks. She had just 
brought the trash downstairs. Sleep was far from her mind, after her 
collapse or whatever had gotten into most of the class after the visit 
to the church. Actually she had a pretty good idea what happened at 
the church and why whatever spell had befallen her seemed lifted 
again.
	That wasn&#39;t what made her stop in front of her best friend&#39;s 
door though. No, what caught her attention was a sound that Miyako 
could at first not believe. She was pretty sure she misheard. There 
was no way that Maron would be crying like that. However, the barely 
audible sounds would not go away and it tore right into the girl&#39;s 
heart. Maron had always been strong. If something would actually make 
her cry, it had to be something... drastic.
	Following a sudden intuition her gaze focused on the door next 
to Maron&#39;s apartment and glared with heated eyes but at the next 
moment wondered why she had done that. The sounds of soft sobs once 
again directed her attention back to the door she now stood in front 
of. It pained her. It pained her more than she wanted to acknowledge 
herself. Maron was very important to Miyako. All throughout school, 
from that day they had first become friends onwards they had always 
been there for each other when something had bothered one of them. 
That had changed a little since Chiaki came into their life. Miyako 
had thought he could make Maron happy but now... Where was he now? And 
did he have something to do with it?
	Whatever it was, she could not abandon her duty as best friend. 
Maron had always been there for her, even when Miyako was pretty sure 
she wasn&#39;t feeling very well herself. The least she could do now was 
to be there for Maron, if only to lend a shoulder to cry on...
	Now, how to do that. Knowing her best friend since they were 
little, she instinctively realized that it was close to impossible to 
get Maron to open that door. And if, then she would probably downplay 
everything and act as if nothing happened. That was Maron for you. 
Sometimes it aggravated Miyako to no end as well as it pained her. It 
always felt like she was failing her part of their oath of friendship 
by not being able to understand and therefore help Maron properly.
	Closing her eyes she reached a decision and after a quick prayer 
for forgiveness of her best friend, pulled out a key she always kept 
hidden but had never before used.

******************************

	Damn, why wouldn&#39;t those tears stop? Why was she crying about 
such a stupid thing?! It wasn&#39;t worth it, he wasn&#39;t worth it. Trust, 
in this form and intensity, was something she should not allow herself 
to have in the first place. If you trusted someone to the point of 
blindness, it only ended up hurting you. She was fine on her own. She 
always had been. So why should it be different now? Why wouldn&#39;t she 
stop crying?
	Maron was so lost in her own misery that she didn&#39;t hear the 
lock of her door clicking open or the low gasp of surprise following 
its opening. It took her about a whole minute until she became even 
aware of another presence in her room. But by then the presence had 
already moved, kneeling right in front of her. Soft hands touched her 
own. Her head jerked up, startled, reflexively thinking it might be 
Chiaki breaking into her apartment. However, when she met the gaze of 
her best friend, red eyes staring at her with unguarded pain, pain at 
what they saw, she felt all thought and speech flee from her.
	How could she have been so foolish? Of course there was someone 
else to trust. There always had been. Right next to her but she had 
never appreciated this one&#39;s efforts properly.
	Not thinking much about her actions, Maron threw herself 
forward, nearly toppling the surprised Miyako over at the intensity of 
the reaction. That was soon forgotten though as she could only look 
down sadly at the broken mess that was once her best friend. Tears 
were soaking the yellow uniform she was still wearing from the trip to 
the church. How could this have happened? Seeing her best friend 
sitting there in that fetal position had been hard enough to 
comprehend but the unrestrained outburst now was something that made 
Miyako a little uncomfortable and unsure how to deal with. Maron had 
never spoken much about her problems. True, Miyako had always wished 
that she would trust her once in awhile with them. It was paining to 
see that the other girl always tried to solve her personal problems 
all by herself. This now was different though and all she found she 
could do was to hold the crying girl as she poured out her heart... 
which probably was the best thing to do in this sort of situation.
	&quot;Maron-chan... what happened?&quot; Miyako was surprised at how 
broken her own voice sounded. Then again, she shouldn&#39;t. It was only 
to be expected in such a surreal situation.
	Maron found it hard to answer. If she could have chosen, she 
would have opted for not saying anything. Just to stay in that safe 
harbor for a little while longer. But she was already feeling guilty 
enough for making Miyako worry. What was she thinking? Why did she 
have such poor control over herself all of a sudden? That wasn&#39;t like 
her at all. And now she dragging her best, human, friend into this as 
well...
	Her eyes shot up feeling soft fingers on her cheek, turning her 
head ever so gently to meet the concerned eyes of the other girl. No, 
concerned was an understatement. It was much more intense. But also, 
there was a kind of stoic determination there that she easily 
recognized as one of Miyako&#39;s special traits... although it was 
usually directed towards her chasing Jeanne...
	&quot;Don&#39;t even dare,&quot; the voice was firm but not harsh or mean. It 
made Maron flinch a little nonetheless and she blinked at the stern 
gaze directed at her, gasping slightly when she saw tears glistering 
in the corners or red eyes... &quot;Don&#39;t you dare say it&#39;s nothing 
important. That you can deal with it yourself. No one can endure 
everything on their own. We are not made to be like this.&quot; Those words 
were spoken in nothing more than a whisper but they could just as well 
have been shouted from the rooftop considering the force with which 
they crushed Maron&#39;s attempt at doing just what her best human friend 
was accusing her of.
	Was she that unfair? Was she unfair to her best friend by not 
sharing her burdens, by not wanting to worry Miyako about her 
problems? But what else could she do...? Didn&#39;t tonight&#39;s events show 
just how much trusting someone with your weaknesses could end up 
hurting you? What good was it to trust like that when you could just 
deal with it yourself? No one would know and you would be fine... or 
that is what most of her life had been like.
	She couldn&#39;t stand that look though. That accusation not meant 
in a hateful way but simply the helplessness of her best friend, the 
helplessness she felt because Maron would not trust Miyako with her 
problems as she was so willingly trusting her own with Maron...
	Miyako stiffened, hearing a single name whispered by her 
distraught friend, all but confirming her former suspicions. There 
really had been no one else who could have hurt Maron like that... 
because the other girl hadn&#39;t allowed someone as close as the 
blue-haired boy before. Miyako&#39;s hands still atop Maron&#39;s own began to 
shake slightly and she fought for control as a cold flare of anger 
erupted inside of her, so intense that it even shocked herself in its 
potency. He had promised! He had promised her not to hurt her Maron!
	Hurt... HER... Maron.
	Well, Miyako had always been somewhat possessive. In a positive 
sort of way, or so she believed. She would do everything for those she 
held dear if it was in her power. And if it was not, well, then she 
would find another way. Maron and her had been very close for years 
and she took the promise of friendship they had given each other VERY 
seriously. Without Maron she would have never been integrated into 
school like this. Miyako owed a lot to Maron when she had believed in 
her when no one else did and had always sought to repay that debt 
somehow. Giving up Chiaki was a small sacrifice. She had really 
believed that he could make her best friend happy, that he could make 
her open up in ways she lacked the ability to. As much as that sad 
realization pained her, it had been alright that way...
	&#39;But now she&#39;s more hurt than before. I wonder if she will ever 
trust someone again?&#39; 
	Cursing Chiaki mentally, Miyako moved her head slightly, 
preparing to place a soft, soothing kiss on Maron&#39;s forehead. The 
sight was heartbreaking and she swore to herself she would do 
anything, everything that was necessary to make her best friend feel 
better.
	Maron, meanwhile, was lost in her own jumbled thoughts. She was 
even more confused now than before, debating whether or not it would 
be worth to trust Miyako with the entire story. Right. How could she 
do that? She was Kaitou Jeanne, the one Miyako had sworn to capture. 
How could she tell her the entire, true story without mentioning that 
&#39;tiny&#39; detail? She couldn&#39;t, that was what. She couldn&#39;t because that 
would destroy even more trust. Hers, just as much as Miyako&#39;s. Maron 
knew how it would end and that end wouldn&#39;t be pretty. Miyako would 
feel betrayed and she would end up in jail by the hands of her best 
friend. A true proof of trust indeed.
	That&#39;s why it was best to trust nobody but yourself.
	Why did it feel so hollow to think that then all of a sudden? 
Why did she yearn to just simply go ahead and tell her best friend 
anything? Maron couldn&#39;t deny that deep down she wanted to trust 
Miyako, she wanted to believe in her to understand. But how can you 
trust someone like that when you have never learned how to?
	It was a predicament that held seemingly no escape. On any other 
occasion she would have come up with something to cover for her 
feelings. By tomorrow, she probably would have had some story at hand 
that she could tell everyone else who would question her mood or the 
inevitable clash that would follow in school at some point with 
Chiaki. However, right now, that was impossible. The wound was still 
too fresh and Miyako had not let her any time to compose herself. She 
had found her in a vulnerable position with no way out...
	What was she to do?
	Later on no one would know what made Maron look up at her best 
friend again at just that crucial moment. It would be impossible to 
tell if it was just pure coincidence, a whim of fate or even Father&#39;s 
will... Who would knew? Who could knew? Who would even care to know 
later? Probably no one.
	Miyako was too surprised at the moment to stop her movement, her 
lips&#39; target suddenly shifting away and finding a new one. A very 
kindred one.
	Everything seemed to stop for an endless moment. Maron&#39;s eyes 
were wide open, her sobs effectively silenced and the tears at least 
frozen for the current instance. Miyako was not better off with a look 
of incredulous bewilderment at this turn of events. However, there was 
also a sudden apprehension in her expression that puzzled some tiny 
part of Maron&#39;s mind.
	And then it was over. Or it should have been. They were supposed 
to pull apart in sudden embarrassment and apologies for the accident. 
Then they might as well laugh about it in the best of cases, breaking 
the sorrowful mood lying over the apartment.
	Just as with the movement that had brought about the unintended 
kiss, Maron would have trouble explaining it later on. The best she 
would come up with was that the stress and the emotional pain of the 
recent discovery had finally exhausted her defenses and sent her 
rational mind into exile for the time being. Miyako let out a startled 
gasp when she felt Maron&#39;s arms fly around her, practically crushing 
her against the other girl&#39;s body as she unexpectedly deepened the 
kiss. The young policeman&#39;s daughter could only look on in wide-eyed 
wonder at the actions of her best friend and she could only follow 
along with the practically desperate pressure of Maron&#39;s lips against 
her own...
	And somewhere from the deepest depths of her heart something 
stirred that she had thought to have long buried.

******************************

	A spell had overtaken the two girls but it wasn&#39;t a magical one. 
Well, not in the sense of mystical, divine or demonic intervention... 
or not that we know of at least. Thoughts were becoming hard to form 
and reason was a concept unknown of for the time being. The actions 
between them became blurry in the participants&#39; own minds and when a 
bit of rational thought slowly emerged from wherever it had been 
banned to before, they were rather shocked at the positions they found 
themselves in.
	Lost in the spell Maron had managed to push her friend onto the 
ground and was right now halfway leaning over her, the purple-haired 
girl&#39;s arm around her neck as they continued to kiss, now open-mouthed 
and with tongue. That alone should have been enough to snap them back 
to reality but what really did was the soft moan of instinctual 
approval from Miyako. Maron had unconsciously began to touch the other 
girl&#39;s breast through the fabric of her uniform.
	However, while their minds were wakeful again after the brief 
bout of very intense necking, they were still trapped in the quickly 
escalating situation, and neither made much of a move to untangle 
themselves from the other. They both simply froze for another moment, 
faces just inches apart from each other, Maron&#39;s hand still resting on 
Miyako&#39;s left breast. Neither said anything. A deafening silence 
echoed throughout the apartment. Neither made a move, frozen in the 
act, knowing that they should stop but not wishing to...
	Maron was lost in a place between reason and yearning. A 
yearning of the kind she had kept hidden so carefully, barely letting 
anyone see it. Chiaki had and he had damaged it even further when it 
already was. What was she doing here? With Miyako? Her best friend? It 
didn&#39;t even matter to her at the moment that she was another girl. Was 
she just looking for an excuse, was her subconscious trying to cling 
onto something, just to drown out her misery? But then she would just 
be using Miyako and that was something that hurt her more than 
thinking about Chiaki&#39;s betrayal.
	Why?
	Why would something that hadn&#39;t happened and wouldn&#39;t happen if 
she just didn&#39;t want to, why did that single thought hurt so much 
more?
	Because she wanted so desperately to trust someone and have that 
trust returned. And the one person who she always wanted to share that 
trust with first and foremost had been and still was Miyako. Long 
before Fin entered her life, long before Chiaki came along and... 
diverted her attention. Yes, that&#39;s what he did. He had come in 
between Miyako and her and the strong friendship they had had, still 
had... That promise, when they were so young, it was important to her. 
More so than Miyako might even realize. Because out of all her 
classmates and so-called friends, Miyako had always been the one to 
understand her most, even when she had worn a brave front, not letting 
her best friend see her own problems. Miyako would know, more than any 
other.
	&quot;We should move this to the bed. This is a little 
uncomfortable.&quot; Maron blinked, nearly scared out of her skin at the 
sudden words breaking the silence and even more so at the casual 
humor, accompanied by an affectionate smile. Both ripped through 
Maron&#39;s single moment of clarity, filling her with confusion once 
again at the look she saw in her best friend&#39;s eyes. She couldn&#39;t 
identify it but for some reason it reminded her of Chiaki... It was a 
comparison she wished not to make but she had no one else to compare 
with. No one else who had ever looked at her this way. Like she was 
the most important thing in the world. But that was ridiculous, Miyako 
wasn&#39;t...
	&quot;Miyako, we should...&quot; the attempt was halfhearted and she knew 
it. She was too emotional drained and confused, too vulnerable to 
fight back whatever had overcome her. And the other girl wasn&#39;t 
helping very much by her refusal to make any attempts of stopping 
this...
	Miyako loosened one arm from around Maron&#39;s neck, only to place 
it on one side of her face. She herself was overcome with the 
strangeness of the situation but even more so with the sudden waves of 
affection and... love, yes, love that she felt like drowning in all of 
a sudden. She had fantasized about it. Once, twice maybe. Just a 
random thought, a random stupid idea playing on the edges of her mind. 
She had always admired Maron. Her inner strength and resolve to 
shoulder her burdens and to still keep smiling every day. And at the 
same time she had always wanted to take these burdens away, to lessen 
the pain her friend no doubt felt about her parents&#39; absence and the 
loneliness that was a direct cause of that.
	It had started as a silly idea at one night. A humorous thought 
that if life continued as it was, she and Maron would probably one day 
end up married as inseparable as they used to be. That silly notion 
had then plagued her the entire night, her mind stubbornly refusing to 
let go and as much as she tried to, she wasn&#39;t even in the 
slightest... shocked at the concept.
	That had been a short while before Jeanne and before Chiaki. 
Chiaki had made a nice distraction from these thoughts and yet they 
remained lingering somewhere in the depths of her heart.
	&quot;We should,&quot; Miyako conceded eventually, making no move to 
follow through with her words, her hand staying there it was, softly 
gazing in confused and vulnerable brown eyes. She had never seen her 
best friend so vulnerable. She had never been allowed to see her like 
that. A part of her felt privileged all of a sudden but the pang in 
her heart at the raw pain of whatever it was that Chiaki had done to 
break Maron&#39;s fragile trust quickly overrode that. Something needed to 
be done about it. Something equally drastic to show Maron that she 
could at least trust her.
	Maron felt a mixture of relief and disappointment when Miyako 
finally, after such a long time of fixing Maron with that irritating 
gaze, made a move to slip out from underneath her, ending this... 
thing... which had definitely gone on long enough. However, her 
rational mind had not nearly enough time to recover, still stunned at 
what transpired and trying to figure out just what she had seen in her 
best friend&#39;s eyes. Miyako had obviously no intention to stop. All 
that she did was roll over the small length to the couch where she 
then proceeded to sit, looking down at Maron with an expectant gaze. 
She had one hand outstretched and it seemed like she was actually... 
beckoning her.
	What the...?
	Once again torn between reason and instinct, the latter still 
mostly in control won out as she moved forward. However, Maron stopped 
briefly when she reached for Miyako&#39;s offered hand. This was crazy but 
she couldn&#39;t stop herself, for reasons only vaguely making sense to 
her... And it seemed Miyako couldn&#39;t either, for her own reasons.
	There was one thing though that she needed to know. Regardless 
of how strong the yearning was, there was one thing holding her back. 
One thing slamming into her with a force of a brick wall, stopping an 
out-of-control drive abruptly. And by all means she should not even 
attempt to tear it down. The thought of what would happen if Miyako 
found out about her secret was the only thing stopping her. She&#39;d end 
up doing the same to her as Chiaki did to her, breaking her trust.
	&quot;Miyako, I am...&quot; What was she doing? Was she that desperate? 
She couldn&#39;t tell her, not now, not ever. But how could she expect 
trust when she wouldn&#39;t give it herself? Who else to trust than 
Miyako?
	Miyako, as if sensing her thoughts leaned forward, taking 
Maron&#39;s hand firmly in both of hers. &quot;I know, Maron-chan. I know.&quot;
	Gasping in surprise, Maron felt her last line of defense crumble 
at the declaration of this. She could see it in Miyako&#39;s eyes. The 
understanding, the comprehension of the secret she had tried so hard 
to hide. That by all means should have shocked her, flooding her mind 
with questions about the how and why. But what was even more shocking 
and what effectively erased any kind of resistance she could have 
still mastered was the total lack of accusation or hurt at the 
betrayal which SHOULD have been there.
	When Miyako pulled her up and into another, softer now, 
actually... loving kiss, she knew that she had lost. Funny, usually 
she succeeded in everything that she set her mind to eventually... but 
on the emotional field, she had never been a very good competitor. 
This had proven to be a battle she could not win... or at least the 
part of her could not that would shy away from the basics of this kind 
of combat.

******************************

	The rest of what transpired was pure instinct. Both girl&#39;s 
thoughts took a pleasant vacation, not troubling themselves for this 
brief time period about the past or future. About the reasons and the 
consequences.
	Maron melted into the kiss this time willingly, submitting to 
the yearning inside of her, the craving for love and affection that 
she wanted so much from her parents, that she thought she had found in 
Chiaki, both times being disappointed. She feared the same now but at 
the same time there was a powerful security preventing her from giving 
into the fear. Miyako wouldn&#39;t disappoint her, she wouldn&#39;t break her 
trust. It was more than a wish-belief. After all the policeman&#39;s 
daughter had just, in a single exchange, revealed her knowledge about 
her identity as Jeanne and that it didn&#39;t matter to her, that she was 
forgiven without needing to give a reason. That she was trusted.
	Both girls had never done what was intended now but in such a 
situation, instincts are often just as good as knowledge. Often even 
more so.
	Moaning, Maron lost herself in the sensation of Miyako&#39;s probing 
against her lips. She was refusing to grant her entrance but not so 
much in an unwilling than a playful way now. Caution, reason and other 
such things were thrown out of the window and since she had 
surrendered to this strange base desire, Maron was going to do her 
best to make the experience at least a worthwhile one.
	Miyako groaned in frustration at her friend&#39;s lack of compliance 
and tried to shift their positions... but even though Miyako was more 
a less a junior police officer, Maron had always been a bit stronger. 
She had always trained herself more intensely she figured, not just in 
Rhythmic Gymnastic. And now was no exception. Maron easily had the 
leverage about the slightly older girl, placed as she was in Miyako&#39;s 
lap, pressing her into the backrest of the couch. The purple-haired 
girl yelped a little in surprise when Maron suddenly caught her tongue 
between the edges of her lip before meeting it with her own.
	&#39;Competitive, aren&#39;t we?&#39; Miyako thought with a sparkling glint 
in her eyes, not surprised to find a bit of mischief reflected back on 
her. Whatever had brought this on, they had connected on a level much 
deeper and more... intimate... than ever before. And the feeling 
was... exquisite. It burned away their prior problems like they were 
made out of paper.
	Maron moved away from Miyako&#39;s mouth after a full minute or so 
of giving no quarter in their tongue fight. A trail towards her 
friend&#39;s... lover&#39;s cheek ended with a whisper into her ear, a 
somewhat husky command that made Miyako shiver in anticipation. &quot;Lie 
down.&quot;
	After Maron moved so that her soon-to-be-lover could comply with 
the request, she positioned herself on Miyako&#39;s stomach with the other 
girl&#39;s legs trapped between her own. Both girls were somewhat 
uncertain how to proceed. Well, they did know about the general 
procedure of sex but this was still uncharted territory, not to 
mention that they were both girls.
	Not wanting to think about it because thinking would surely 
spoil the moment while changing nothing of the outcome, Maron took the 
initiative once again and removed her top in one swift movement making 
her passive partner-in-crime gasp slightly at the sight of bare skin 
only covered by a moderate bra. A thin layer of perspiration could be 
seen glimmering in the dim light of the Moon, the only real light 
illuminating the apartment. Her hands were shaking a little, 
tentative, almost to the point of shy, when Miyako reached up to touch 
her best friend. Maron shivered at the touch but leaned in 
unconsciously, urging her friend onwards. And onwards Miyako 
proceeded, magnetically pulled towards the clasp hiding the last of 
Maron&#39;s upper body. The younger girl moaned, beginning her own 
explorations again, her hands roaming over the skill clothed chest 
area of Miyako, eliciting similar sounds of approval.
	&quot;Miyako...&quot; Maron gasped out sharply. The police daughter had 
succeeded in slipping off her bra. The piece of undergarment had 
fallen to the floor next to them, long forgotten since Miyako was 
already directing attention to the young, average-sized breasts in 
front of her. She was surprised at the lack of embarrassment that she 
felt... or not felt. In any case, it probably was the surrealism of 
the situation, a situation she would have betted all her money against 
happening if given the chance when she first entered the apartment. 
This was all so new and very bizarre. If not for the pleading look in 
Maron&#39;s eyes that at first had been nothing more than a distant 
glimmer, she doubted she would have gone through this. Only for Maron 
she would.
	Miyako had trouble continuing her inexperienced yet effective 
massage of her friend-turned-lover&#39;s breasts because Maron had once 
again slipped away. Actually she had just skidded backwards a little 
on the usual comfy but right now somewhat narrow-seeming couch so that 
she could reach the hem of Miyako&#39;s uniform. It was an innocent, not 
even planned action but by doing so their regions below that 
simultaneously increased their heat for the last few minutes now 
brushed against each other through the fabrics of their respected 
skirt and trousers. Miyako gripped for Maron&#39;s breasts a little 
tighter at the flare that shot through her courtesy of the contact 
which in turn heightened Maron&#39;s own experience of the moment.
	Pleasure overriding the slow pace mostly caused by nagging 
uncertainty and inexperience, Maron pulled up Miyako&#39;s top with 
renewed vigor, delighting in the feel of her hands as they brushed 
over the bare skin below. Lifting up her arms and upper body Miyako 
complied instantly, making the yellow uniform join Maron&#39;s own in a 
heap on the floor. Both now felt the need for more contact, more skin 
contact. And fast.
	Maron, however, took her time to admire her best friend&#39;s body 
underneath the usual layers of clothing, trailing lazy paths with her 
hands over the bare skin, paths that all ended eventually at the edge 
of the last concealment factor. She had always thought Miyako was 
beautiful. She had a bit of an exotic quality with the dark purple 
hair and the reddish-brown eyes not to mention that somewhat 
extravagant hair style. But you could easily see that she was 
practically as well trained as Maron was through her exercises in 
Rhythmic Gymnastic. The skin was flawless and practically no ounce of 
fat visible. In this undeniable erotic moment, the sight presented her 
friend in a totally new light for Maron.
	Miyako meanwhile was in a bit of trouble, cursing her 
consciousness for rearing its ugly head in the most unsuited of 
moments. She had taken the time to admire the brunette&#39;s body as well, 
being equally taken by the moment. But a fleeting thought had spoiled 
the experience a little. A thought that was hard to hold onto when 
with a movement worthy of her other identity Maron somehow had managed 
to unfasten her bra without the slightest bit of warning or visible 
movement. And then grinning a little like a hungry cat, her best 
friend leaned forward, flicking out her tongue to brush over one 
QUICKLY hardening nipple.
	&quot;Oh God...&quot; she breathed out at the flame of desire enveloping 
her entire meaning... and Maron had just started! Emboldened by he 
reaction Maron began an experimental exploration of her very sensitive 
flesh, occasionally flicking over the nipple. Her second hand was 
brought up to join the efforts of her lips and tongue.
	The sensual overload was almost too much for Miyako to bear and 
she whimpered in pleasure. She really, REALLY didn&#39;t want to stop. Not 
at all...
	&#39;Stupid consciousness...&#39;
	&quot;Maron, stop,&quot; she breathed softly. As if struck by a lightning 
bolt the brown-haired sometimes Kaitou jerked her head up, stopping 
her ministration and producing another whimper from Miyako, this time 
in disappointment. Fighting down her own need, the purple-haired girl 
was fast in alleviating her best friend&#39;s fears, knowing instantly 
that in her fragile state the words could easily be misinterpreted... 
and obviously had been. &quot;No, no, not like that,&quot; Miyako underlined, 
pulling a not resisting Maron up for a gentle, fluttery kiss that made 
both girls tingle from the inside at the sweet feeling. Assured she 
had the brunette&#39;s attention, she gesticulated towards Maron&#39;s phone. 
&quot;I need to call my parents and tell them that I&#39;ll stay over.&quot; At 
Maron&#39;s look of comprehension, she looked down at their entangled 
position, leaving not much room for movement. &quot;And maybe we should 
move this upstairs.&quot; It took Maron a bit longer to make the connection 
but when she did, a small, adorable blush colored her cheeks and she 
meekly nodded.
	However, when she made to get up, Miyako immediately noticed the 
apprehension, the moment that had captured and brought them to this 
point, temporally broken, leaving room for the old feelings of fear 
and doubt to return. Miyako caught Maron&#39;s hands which made the 
brunette look back quizzically. The policeman&#39;s daughter tried to look 
as convincing and honest as she could. She still found this crazy. Not 
that she wasn&#39;t attracted to Maron, the entire event had pretty much 
dragged out her feelings on the matter once more so far, but this 
seemed so fast and drastic.
	But if she let this stop now, it was almost guaranteed that 
Maron would slip into depression again, undoing all progress she had 
made in those few minutes with a for once unguarded Maron... 
Besides... she wanted to see Maron happy. And if she somehow, through 
some truly weird whim of fate, coincidence or whatever it was achieved 
that goal herself, it would make her happy as well.
	&quot;I&#39;ll be up in a minute.&quot;
	Maron stared for a few, long moments at her best friend&#39;s face, 
brown eyes locked with reddish ones. Her mind was still a whirl and 
now, during this interruption, she had briefly allowed herself to 
ponder, to think about the rationality of her actions. This was crazy, 
by all means, it was crazier than actually believing Chiaki/Sindbad 
when he said he wasn&#39;t here by the Devil&#39;s orders. She was about to 
have s... No, she was about to make love for the first time, to her 
best friend other than Fin... And she wanted to. Her lonely self had 
emerged with a new vengeance, betrayed by Chiaki it had grasped onto 
that new, that maybe last ray of hope to find the love and trust she 
had always wanted but in her fear to be hurt again never allowed 
herself...
	Miyako&#39;s eyes were so sincere. So open, unguarded and filled 
with affection, it made her heart warm at the unexpected intensity to 
be found in them.
	Pushing back so-called reason which had only brought her 
loneliness over the years back into the furthest corner of her heart 
that she could find, a firm resolution settled in, taking its place. 
She would try one more time, one last gamble. If that didn&#39;t work, she 
might as well give it up altogether. Her neglected heart was tired of 
the loneliness and yearning for attention.
	With a smile, radiating the inner strength of Kusakabe Maron, 
this time though devoid of its usual purpose of protecting her fragile 
heart, she nodded at Miyako before starting to head for the stairs and 
feeling naughty all of a sudden, wiggled her hips slightly, knowing 
that her friend was watching her.
	Back on the couch Miyako gulped silently and after Maron had 
vanished up the stairs, practically jumped to the phone so that she 
could get this call over with and join her soon-to-be lover upstairs 
before either of them were to change their mind.

******************************

	Maron had been waiting upstairs in her bedroom for just about 
the promised minute now. While her decision was final, she could not 
help the apprehension and doubt lurking just beneath, only held back 
by an iron will... Her selfish, lonely self was in control now but 
only to a certain degree. With Miyako&#39;s presence missing, it was 
enough to weaken whatever had driven her to the happenings below in 
the first place. Weakening but not destroying. Oh no, she would be 
going through with this. She wanted to go through this. A shudder of 
giddiness made her tremble in sudden anticipation and she almost 
jumped when the bed underneath her moved, announcing the arrival of 
her soon-to-be-lover.
	A kiss was placed on both of her bare shoulders, arms wrapping 
around her body. Maron had been sitting on the edge of her bed, turned 
away from the stairs all the time... after she had taken the time to 
slip out of the rest of her clothing as an act of defiance, to make 
sure that her doubts and fears wouldn&#39;t get the better of her. A kind 
of crazy logic but Maron was way beyond reason and simply didn&#39;t care 
about that anymore.
	All those thoughts were banished instantly when she felt Miyako 
come up behind her, pressing her equally nude chest into her back, 
hands coming around to cup her breasts more firmly, with more purpose 
than before and devoid of the slight hesitation. Both girls were in a 
state of mind where hesitation could very well break the spell that 
was pushing them onwards further and... neither of them wanted that to 
happen.
	Tilting her head, Maron found Miyako&#39;s intense eyes once again 
gazing at her and without a word both leaned in for a kiss. Gentle and 
slow at first, meaningful, before rapidly ascending into the 
passionate spheres as Miyako&#39;s hands became bolder, massaging the 
supple flesh beneath and once in awhile giving a tweak to her nipples. 
The brunette was overwhelmed by the powerful feelings coursing through 
her. She had imagined that it would be good, after all who wouldn&#39;t? 
But they had all been fantasies, wishful dreams that growing up had 
morphed into something so far out of reach she would have believed 
this situation might never come for her. Now it was and she felt a 
startling strong connection to her unexpected - but not entirely 
unwanted - partner.
	Maron was barely aware of Miyako&#39;s now wandering hands, losing 
herself in the wonderful feelings their intimacy produced. Her eyes, 
closed for some time now in order to better savor the feedback of her 
other senses, snapped open at the first tentative brush over her 
nether regions. She found Miyako gazing at her questioningly, unsure 
of how... or better whether or not to proceed. The question was a 
rather rhetorical one in their current situation. In their position 
Maron was trapped into helpless passivity, unlike downstairs where she 
had executed some control over what was happening. No, control was the 
wrong term. She didn&#39;t have any control ever since Miyako crossed her 
threshold and this bizarre twist had started. The brunette had been 
unguarded, exposed, lacking any of her normal defenses and was thus 
completely at the mercy of her previously bruised emotions and 
whatever her best friend wanted her to do. Amazingly enough, she 
didn&#39;t feel as frightened of the latter as she was of the former.
	She trusted Miyako.
	A slight nod from the other girl made Miyako smile broadly, not 
to mention cheer inwardly at the first signs of deeper trust, trust 
for her. Carefully she maneuvered her hand so that she could slip one 
finger into Maron&#39;s certainly moist but also very tight passage. She 
met less resistance than she had expected though, making her wonder if 
Maron might have... experimented. Not that Miyako could blame her, 
considering her own recent... curiosity. It was hard to tell though 
and she surely wasn&#39;t going to ask about that right now.
	Maron&#39;s eyes fluttered close again and a deep, very content 
sound broke forth from her throat, ALMOST reminding Miyako of a cat&#39;s 
purr. It was certainly stimulating as well as satisfying. For a moment 
Miyako pondered the action of getting Maron to lie down for this, 
however, she reveled too much into the current position of control and 
Maron&#39;s unrestrained relent. Her best friend and now lover was showing 
her a kind of trust that she had long sought and thus would not give 
up easily.
	By now the policeman&#39;s daughter had begun a leisure but steady 
pace of moving her single digit around in Maron&#39;s passage. She had 
waited a little until the brunette became more comfortable with the 
intrusion before starting the first, tiny thrusts. An expression of 
bliss masked the helpless girl&#39;s face and her breath came in rapid, 
short intakes. Those sounds only doubled, maybe even tripled, when 
Miyako settled a second finger experimentally against her entrance 
before slowly working it inside...
	If anyone could see her now, Maron surely would have died of 
embarrassment. Not that she was suddenly ashamed of what they were 
doing, of what Miyako was doing to her. Confused and astonished, 
maybe, but not ashamed. In fact the fire that had started from her 
thighs was quickly spreading through her whole body, making her feel 
pleasure she never had felt before. Her sorrows, problems, depression, 
all was washed away right now as she let herself fall, submitting 
willingly to the ministrations of her best friend and now lover.
	The brunette pressed harder into the contact when a second 
finger had begun to stretch her most private of places, feeling an 
overwhelming craving for the new rise of pleasure it brought. 
Obviously sensing her increasing lust, Miyako&#39;s pace quickened, her 
fingers now thrusting faster and deeper until they reached the final 
bit of sanctuary left now...
	&quot;More...&quot; Maron surprised herself with the request. Being at the 
mercy of someone else for once though, the feeling of no control, the 
necessity to trust someone else than her, it was an exhilarating 
feeling, it was like a fire burning away at the walls she had built 
around her heart, letting it soar freely after such a long time. Such 
a... refreshing, liberating feeling...
	While the single word could have been misunderstood Maron&#39;s 
brown eyes were telling Miyako all she needed to know and it made her 
choke in shocked surprise at the raw plea there. So fragile, so easy 
to break apart, that naked, unprotected act of trust so unlike her 
best friend. The sense of responsibility grabbing a hold of Miyako in 
that moment was almost unbearable. Maron was offering her a gift of 
trust she had even after the unexpected spiral of events executed 
tonight not expected. Not yet, anyway, not for a long time probably.
	It was in her hands, literally, to totally shatter or slowly 
heal Maron&#39;s wounded heart.
	&quot;Miyako-chan,&quot; Maron whimpered, snapping her out of her shock. 
She realized that she ceased the movements of her hand, much to her 
lover&#39;s displeasure. &quot;Please,&quot; Maron breathed out, the need in her 
eyes overwhelming and hard to comprehend. It wasn&#39;t just lust but more 
a raw need, a plea for attention, for the one thing that had been 
lacking for most of the younger girl&#39;s life. Trust.
	&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Miyako asked, bringing one hand to brush through 
brown hair before stopping on one side of Maron&#39;s face. Before the 
tiny yet firm nod came, Miyako knew already she could not refuse her 
friend&#39;s wish, nor did she want to. It was up to her now to make Maron 
happy and wasn&#39;t that what a part of her, a suppressed but still 
strong part, had always wanted? Chiaki had obviously proven to have 
failed the task, it was up to her now. And she would be damned if she 
ended up hurting Maron as well. She would rather shoot herself...
	Maron leaned her head back into Miyako&#39;s when the purple-haired 
girl picked up the thrusting of her fingers again and now even wiggled 
with a third on her entrance. The speed increased again and she could 
only gasp and moan at the more frantic thrusts. Miyako was nuzzling 
her hair and she could dimly pick up whispers of love and promises of 
security which her heart absorbed greedily like a child would praise. 
Maron was lost in the whirl of passion overtaking all her senses and 
barely felt a difference when Miyako&#39;s third finger finally slipped 
inside, stretching her much further. Not painfully so, Miyako was very 
careful not to overdo it... The free hand had settled on Maron&#39;s right 
breast and had reflexively been covered by both of Maron&#39;s own, 
grasping tightly onto it in a way of further connecting to Miyako.
	Just the tiniest bit of hesitation was warning Maron of the 
moment she had longed for. Apprehension, doubt, fear as well as 
desire, longing, yearning and her already wounded feelings of trust 
came together with a sudden clash and deafening eruption when Miyako 
thrust forwards again, breaking through the restricting layer of her 
hymen, robbing her irreversibly of her virginity.
	As the flare of pain was overridden by the cresting tsunami of 
her release, Maron knew that she belonged to Miyako now. The older 
girl - if only by a few months - held her heart, to shatter or to mend 
as she pleased.
	But she trusted Miyako. More than anyone else. Miyako would not 
hurt her, that she was certain of.

******************************

	A couple of minutes later - or maybe it had been much longer, 
neither girl could really tell - Miyako was lying on her back, keening 
loudly at the attention her body was currently favored with. The 
police daughter had always been a rather vocal girl with a menacing 
temper that could be truly scaring if you ended up on the receiving 
end. It was hard to refrain from just giving in to the urge to just 
shout out her feelings right now. Only knowing that once she&#39;d given 
it, she might as well wake the entire floor provided the success of 
her efforts. It was a very hard effort, that was for sure.
	Maron had her lying down on the bed now and was beyond 
feverishly paying her new lover back for the earlier treatment. 
Whenever in the mood, Maron had often displayed a teasing nature, a 
playfulness that could be both adorable and annoying at times. 
However, Miyako had never missed to cherish these opportunities, 
showing her friend from a more carefree, happier side. Right now, she 
was torn between both adoration and annoyance again. Annoyance because 
Maron was taking an exquisite and torturous time to treat her body 
with her lips and tongue while slowly descending on it. A lick here, a 
fluttering but all too brief kiss there, only occasionally more 
persistent and arousing. The combination left her swaying between 
dissatisfaction, anticipation and need. To make it short, Maron was 
driving her crazy!
	Maron for her part was savoring the experience. The pleasure 
both physical as well as spiritual Miyako had brought her earlier was 
a gift she would cherish forever. Now she had to pay her lover back 
for the wonderful experience. That was what relationships were about, 
right? Equal partners. She had given Miyako her trust and now it had 
to work the other way round. And Miyako didn&#39;t make a move to 
disapprove that notion, wiggling, squirming and all but growling at 
times when Maron met a particular sensual spot with her mouth, but 
never rushing her. Truth be told, Maron was taking her time not just 
for the teasing but also too steel her resolve once more. This was 
still uncharted territory and while she was not that oblivious to what 
was meant to be done by her, she could not help but feel a certain 
insecurity left. What Miyako had done to her was beautiful, unmatched 
in her experience so far. What if she could not live up to that 
example and...
	She shoved the thought away vehemently, feeling Miyako&#39;s tangled 
in her own, by now messy, hair. Looking up from her playful 
path-carving, she gasped seeing the lust and need mixed within reddish 
eyes into a powerful plea that was framed by cross features that Maron 
recognized at being partially playful as well but also partial 
serious. &quot;If you don&#39;t start for real soon, I am going to be very 
cross with you.&quot;
	As was mentioned, Miyako&#39;s temper could be very scaring.
	Maron gulped once and then giggled unexpectedly. &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot; 
Ignoring the weak cries of the doubts having been tranquilized by 
Miyako&#39;s actions, Maron resolved to not disappoint Miyako&#39;s trust as 
much as she didn&#39;t wanted to be disappointed herself. These were 
supposed to be the dynamics of a relationship, or at least she 
believed so, she wished them to be...
	This time Miyako did cry out, burying her hands deeper into 
brown hair. Maron had been just below her left breast and had swiftly 
ascended the short distance until she was able to touch her lips to 
the erect nipple. She had already found out just how sensitive those 
were and was now about to try something new. Not quite certain how far 
to go, she applied just a little bit of pressure by tugging at the nub 
with her teeth. Her experiment successful she sucked a bit harder, 
making Miyako gasp at the sensation of just the tiniest bit of bit of 
pain stimulating the pleasure. She nearly swore out loud when Maron 
pulled away shortly after that but was silenced again as the target 
was switched to its counterpart, meeting the same treatment... and the 
same time span.
	&#39;Great, she&#39;s enjoying it&#39;, Miyako groaned inwardly but 
restrained herself from pushing the pace. Maron had proven to be 
stronger anyway and from the glint in her eyes Miyako believed she 
wouldn&#39;t cease her torturous treatment until meeting her goal. 
Whatever that... was...
	&quot;Marrrron...&quot; A cry somewhere between squealing and purring 
lurched from Miyako&#39;s lips. She had still been on that cloud between 
pleasure and aggravation where her lover&#39;s latest actions had left her 
and had barely seen her move further down her body before it was too 
late. The feeling of Maron&#39;s tongue probing at her more than yearning 
for the attention lower lips came wholly unexpected. Her eyes flew 
wide open and she could only stare as Maron looked up briefly to meet 
her gaze with a wicked grin before diving right in between her 
compliantly wide-spread thighs.
	The purple-haired girl was amazed at the boldness of the move. 
While she had... um, read about this once - purely by accident! - she 
had not expected Maron to know or at the very least not for her to 
right away put it to practice. Not that Toudaiji Miyako would protest 
one tiny bit! Biting her lip from screaming out loud, a series of 
loud, satisfied moans accompanied Maron&#39;s sluggish, inexperienced but 
nonetheless very pleasing efforts below.
	Maron was thrilled at the response. She hadn&#39;t really know what 
had made her do it, suddenly overcome to taste the salty juices, 
product of her own effect on the other girl. The thought of finding it 
a little gross never came to mind. She was functioning more or less 
solely on instinct now, answering the demands of her body. And her 
body had wanted to do that, so she had complied... not regretting it 
at all.
	The taste of Miyako&#39;s arousal was a mixture of salty and spicy. 
A truly exotic combination, just like the girl herself often proved to 
be. Maron was happily lapping them up once having received a sample. 
Her tongue swirled around, trying to copy a bit clumsily the movements 
or at least the invoked sensation that Miyako&#39;s efforts had brought 
forth from her earlier. Judging by the moans and the occasional cry... 
okay, more like shrikes bordering on the edge of a louder scream.
	Miyako was by now beyond crazy, beyond wild. If the slow 
ministrations before were frustrating, this was proving to be a total 
sensual overload. Her hands that had come to rest just over her 
breasts when Maron had slipped downwards, had begun to massage them 
now, being caught in the whirlwind of ecstasy, mindless with pleasure 
and need, with no way out. It didn&#39;t even matter to her that Maron was 
proving to be a bit clumsy. Alright, Miyako herself had nothing to 
compare with but it would not have mattered either way. She felt the 
buildup of pleasure, the maelstrom of energy ready to crest any moment 
now...
	And Maron withdrew her tongue.
	&quot;Ma... RON!&quot; she meant to shout in exasperation, heedless of the 
noise now but the ceased sensation of her lover&#39;s tongue inside her 
most sensitive area was soon replaced by the equally thrilling one of 
two fingers pushing deep inside her, just to the tip of her own hymen. 
Finding it difficult to even move her head, Miyako managed to meet the 
querying brown eyes from below that she had expected to find. No 
further movement or sign of approval was really necessary, their eyes 
speaking everything, Miyako&#39;s own trust as heart-warming as Maron&#39;s 
had before.
	Without further ado Maron pushed forwards, making Miyako&#39;s head 
fall down heavily onto the cushion again, the explosion rushing 
through her entirely too powerful to do anything else. Distantly she 
took note that Maron had brought her tongue back into play, 
intensifying the roaring pleasure with the dual assault but Miyako had 
already closed her eyes in absolute bliss. No fleeting fantasy could 
have ever prepared her for this.
	There was no regret whatsoever, in fact Miyako was very glad 
that it was Maron who had made her feel like that. The policeman&#39;s 
daughter vowed that she would make sure that Maron was happy, even if 
she had to pummel everyone that threatened Maron&#39;s heart. It was hers 
to treasure now, and treasure she would it as long as Maron wanted her 
to and beyond.

	Morning came over Momokori and the sun slowly crept up into the 
sky from beyond the horizon. The first rays began to shine through 
windows, stirring the first unfortunate victims gently but in most 
cases still unwanted from their dreams to meet the new day.
	Kusakabe Maron grumbled still half-asleep, not wanting to leave 
the feeling of security her dreams had given her. It had been nice 
dreams, not the more than occasional nightmare she had become 
accustomed to. She couldn&#39;t remember when the last time since her 
parents left her alone had been that she had slept this good, neither 
could she quite remember the reason.
	The few rays peaking through her curtains were persistent, 
however, and then she had finally rolled over with a groan her mind 
was already almost awake, the cobwebs there clearing rapidly. And with 
them came the memories. The memories of probably the most bizarre 
nights she had ever experienced. The multitude of feelings the 
opposing images she could recall on the brink of waking were 
overwhelming for her sleepy mind. They weren&#39;t part of whatever dream 
she had been having, she was certain of that. And she could tell that 
she was quite naked, so that disapproved the imaginary theory all 
together. Maybe just the part of Chiaki being Sindbad was imagination. 
That would be nice.
	Unfortunately logic reminded her that the night with Miyako 
would certainly never have come to be if not for what she had learned 
earlier at the church. In a way, whatever his intention, Chiaki had 
lost any chance with Maron. But not quite as he might imagine. How 
ironic.
	The brunette quirked a smile at the wonderful memories of making 
love to Miyako and the absolute security she had felt. Unlike Chiaki, 
at no point after giving in to her best friend had she really doubted 
that Miyako would let her fall, would hurt her like he did. The tiny 
doubts and fears had not stood up to the friendship they had also 
shared prior, providing a much firmer basis.
	Maron proceeded to turn around to snuggle back into the embrace 
of her lover, remembering fondly the way they had fallen asleep... 
just to realize that she had just moved a few moments ago. Her eyes 
flew open with a sudden outburst of strangling, cold fear and a silent 
scream of denial from her heart. Miyako was nowhere to be seen.
	A million and one possibilities ran through her head and having 
her trust broken so much, her wish to be loved and love herself being 
shattered so often, most of them were negative, centered on just that 
possibility. And the idea of Miyako, who she trusted more than anyone 
other than Fin doing this to her was unbearable. It didn&#39;t even begin 
to compare to Chiaki&#39;s betrayal. This was...
	&quot;Oh no.&quot; The words accompanied by a sharp gasp gratefully cut 
her dark thoughts short. Miyako had just taken the last step upwards. 
She had to briefly go down and assure her mother and father that 
everything was alright with Maron and her. They&#39;d surely worry despite 
of how much they knew both could take of themselves. Her explanations 
yesterday had been short and not telling much. Maron had still been 
sleeping when she woke up rather early and, not wanting to disturb the 
sight of her peaceful sleeping lover, had quietly slipped out of the 
bed to take care of that business before other things would come up.
	Miyako kicked herself mentally at her stupidity. &#39;First morning 
after you vowed to make Maron happy and you already messed up.&#39; She 
had broken the first rule of what not to do on a morning after with 
your fragile-hearted lover who had experienced too much heartache 
already. Never let them wake up alone.
	&quot;Oh, Maron-chan!&quot; Faster than Maron was even able to blink, the 
policeman&#39;s daughter had crossed the short distance from the stairs to 
the bed and was next to her on the bed, enveloping her in a crushing 
hug that did indeed that. Crush the brief but all too real fear the 
brunette had experienced upon waking with Miyako there. &quot;I&#39;m so 
sorry,&quot; the purple-haired girl apologized profusely, on the verge of 
tears. &quot;I was just making sure that my parents wouldn&#39;t worry too much 
and you looked so peaceful and beautiful sleeping, I just couldn&#39;t 
wake you and...&quot;
	Maron blinked as her best friend and now lover rambled on, her 
heart warming when faced with such powerful concern and banishing even 
the latest bits of doubts that remained. Hugging Miyako with equally 
fervor, resting her head on the older girl&#39;s shoulders. &quot;It&#39;s okay, 
Miyako-chan. You are here now, that&#39;s all that counts. I was stupid 
for doubting you even a moment.&quot; Miyako started to disagree but was 
surprised, pleasantly so, at being silenced by a kiss.
	She had really been stupid, Maron reasoned silently. After last 
night, she should never have doubted Miyako, not even caught between 
dreaming and reality. She cursed her own weakness and how quick she 
let herself hurt whenever something like this happened. She always 
tended to make snap judgments when her heart was hurt, making up 
excuses or simply closing herself off from the hurt altogether. Maybe 
she had even done Chiaki wrong... After all, the least she could have 
done was hear him out and then decide whether she wanted to believe 
his motives or not. Well, that had eventually resulted in the events 
of last night. Something she was NOT sorry about. Certainly not.
	They had lain awake afterwards for some time, spent and 
altogether sated. It was nice just to be in each other&#39;s arms, holding 
each other, feeling the other&#39;s soft, regular breathing. They had 
talked a little then. Especially since Maron once the action was over 
with had been rather curious about Miyako&#39;s obvious knowledge about 
Jeanne. Apparently Miyako had been suspecting something ever since the 
incident with the symbol of their friendship. At first she had not 
remembered anything but then pieces of her memory clouded by the 
demon&#39;s presence in her body had resurfaced. Not enough to make much 
sense, but enough to make her think. From that point onwards she had 
put the puzzle together slowly. That had reminded Maron of something 
Fin told her once. When under a demon&#39;s control the victim actually 
did experience everything but after freed the subconsciousness usually 
chose to push away the horrifying experience and act as if all that 
never happened or all memory of this time was lost. It figured, Miyako 
was always to persistent to just let her subconsciousness shut away 
some frightening experience forever.
	Without exactly knowing the details, Miyako had figured most of 
it out for herself, which spoke volumes for the girl but also volumes 
for the trust she put in Maron. There was no blame put upon her for 
keeping the secret and Miyako had not even once considered blowing her 
cover, knowing somewhere deep down that Maron DID have a good reason 
for doing what she was.
	*You could never be a pity thief,* Miyako had said with utmost 
conviction and the memory of that was adding to the warmth spreading 
through her now, hugging Miyako so closely, their lips gentle and 
sweetly pressed against each other. She was safe here, with her. 
Miyako would guard her heart. Always. Not even finding out about her 
being Jeanne had swayed her opinion of Maron&#39;s character. What more 
was there to prove someone trustworthy than that?
	The brunette sighed when their lips separated. Tugging at Miyako 
who was only dressed in a simple robe, she pulled them both down to 
lie back on the covers. Getting the hint Miyako moved so that their 
position that they went to sleep in and which she had awakened to was 
copied again. With her spooned up behind Maron, the brunette snuggled 
deep into her body like a frightened child seeking shelter... and 
finding it.
	&quot;I want to stay like this forever,&quot; Maron admitted after awhile 
of comfortable silence. Feeling so content and secure. It was almost 
like those blurry memories of her childhood, when she was so young she 
barely remembered it. She and her parents had still been a family 
then. A real, loving family. Right now she felt equally sheltered. 
There were many things to do, many things to talk about, but they 
could wait a little while longer.
	&quot;It&#39;s almost time to get up for school,&quot; Miyako replied casually 
but made no move to do just that. &quot;I can stay here if you want. I told 
Okaasan you weren&#39;t feeling well and that I would take care of you if 
you would like me to.&quot;
	Oh, how much Maron wanted her to. How much she wanted nothing 
else right now than to stay like this. Peaceful and loved for once. 
Not waking up alone every night, with no one around to wake her or 
greet her when she got up for breakfast. Fin had briefly filled this 
void but not the way Miyako did now, after last night. She wasn&#39;t 
entirely certain where this was going to lead to, however, if this was 
just the beginning... then she would not mind finding out what else 
lay in store for her... for them. Thoughts of consequences, reactions 
and such troubling things were on the edge of her mind. She wasn&#39;t 
allowing them to take hold yet, savoring the tranquility of the 
moment.
	And nonetheless what Maron said was a different thing, knowing 
that it would be rather selfish to hold back Miyako. She was indeed 
not feeling up to go back to school today. Too much would certainly be 
occupying her mind. Chiaki - who she had resolved to face soon and 
find out about his real motives -, the new relationship between her 
and Miyako... &quot;No, Miyako-chan. I don&#39;t want to hold you back, 
besides... I need to think some stuff through on my own.&quot;
	Maron was startled when Miyako turned her around a bit so that 
the two girls could look at each other. The intensity and sincerity of 
what she saw in the red eyes of her long time best friend, and now so 
much more, was breathtaking, more than underlining and confirming her 
next words. &quot;I love you, Maron,&quot; Miyako spoke in a whisper, still 
maintaining a firm strength in her voice, belying no argument about 
the matter.
	The object of that declaration and devotion was too stunned to 
answer right away. She had seen it last night but had been uncertain 
just how much had been a product of her imagination. But now, now she 
was unable to deny the unwavering sincerity of these words. Maron felt 
tiny all of a sudden, inadequate, because she felt like she needed to 
reply to that, in kind, equally as convincing... But she couldn&#39;t. 
Love was something she had never really learned and all her attempts 
had ended in ruins. How was she supposed to make such a honest 
declaration if she didn&#39;t even know exactly what love was?
	Miyako could see her struggle. For her, the words had been 
easier. She had her parents as a wonderful example and why sometimes a 
little shy - as her crush on Chiaki had proven - she was usually quite 
certain about her feelings once she had determined them for what they 
were. She did love Maron. It had grown over the years, she assumed, 
but was not really sure what had started it to begin with. Maybe there 
wasn&#39;t so much as a fixed point of origin, more like a gradual thing. 
It had more or less slipped by her without notice until now.
	But last night had made clear to her just what exactly it was 
that she was feeling for her best friend. She wanted to make her 
happy, guard her fragile heart and make sure that beautiful smile 
Maron wore in moments of joy never vanished and became more sincere 
than she thought it was most of the time. In short, Maron had become 
much more important to her over the years than just a best friend.
	Seeing Maron struggle with an answer, Miyako leaned forward to 
gently press a finger against Maron&#39;s lips, shaking her head ever so 
slightly. &quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; she commanded quietly. &quot;I know. Tell me on your own 
time.&quot;
	Relief flooded Maron&#39;s heart, relief and another wave of 
amazement at just how much Miyako proved to know her even with Maron 
usually guarding her emotions from everyone. Words were not always 
necessary it would seem. Miyako was right for her, she knew that then. 
Whether to call it love she did not know but she swore to find out and 
not to keep Miyako waiting for too long. And she would not disappoint 
her either.
	The exchange of trust initiated last night and surviving the 
morning had created a new bond between the two girls, one neither was 
wishing to break. And soon enough that new bond would prove fatal for 
the efforts of two certain high-ranked demons... Because as the two 
lovers continued to enjoy their morning snuggle and the first twinges 
of a blossoming love that neither had looked or dared to find in the 
other but was nonetheless welcomed and cherished, it would appear 
Noin&#39;s plan to weaken Jeanne&#39;s heart had quite clearly backfired. 

THE END(?)

Author&#39;s Notes

Oy, what was that exactly, Maia?
[*looks out of the window, innocently whistling*]
Right... There you see. I had nothing to do with it. I mean it is nice 
that she got so inspired to let me write this in a little over a 
day... Close two twenty pages in my usual format in a little over one 
day (including sleep, pauses etc.) but... would you mind concentrating 
on SL please? Geez, now you give her a project with a multi-fandom 
basis but no... she goes of and makes me do something completely 
different.
&#39;tis the fate of us authors. We art though at the mercy of our 
muses... (please ignore my pathetic attempt of old-style English...)

Right. If you managed to actually read through this, I congratulate 
you. Not that it&#39;s bad. Without having read over it yet (what I&#39;ll do 
before posting) I admit that I AM quite satisfied with that. So what 
do you think?
It would appear that I REALLY cannot right a pure lemon (well, the SL 
side arc excluded since I am just filling in scenes). I am just too 
much of a drama/epic writer so there has to be some plot, there has to 
be character development and... THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SHORT, 
S-H-O-R-T lemony ficclet. Nothing more... Great, I really can&#39;t write 
PWP... Which, I suppose is actually a good thing but still... It took 
me about one third of the story length before I even got to a distant 
lemony part...
Don&#39;t misunderstand. I don&#39;t like plot-less lemon and I always try to 
make mine at least remotely discerning. But... Crap, I can&#39;t even call 
that a SHORT story anymore. Goes way beyond the usual length of my 
usual length for one. It was not planned that way...

*glances around* What? Oh fine, I stop complaining and get on with it. 
There is actually not much to say. She *points at muse* was bugging me 
so much I decided to at least give it a try to shut her up........... 
she&#39;s already throwing sequel ideas into my head!!!
No, no, I don&#39;t know if I do one, and if I certainly don&#39;t know when, 
my focus IS still on the Soul Lights Continuum, I just got... 
sidetracked.
It was an interesting experience to write, that I can easily admit. 
Both Maron and Miyako aren&#39;t exactly easy to do but it went rather 
well. I don&#39;t claim that I invested as much time as into my Sailor 
Moon stories for the characters to get them just right and believable. 
I suppose in this story they do appear a little out of character here 
and there although I really tried to be as close to what I believe 
their (anime) personality to be like.
As for Miyako having a key... Well, now come on. They&#39;ve been living 
next to each other for years I believe and Maron is all alone right 
now. I would believe that the Toudaiji family at least has one key in 
case of emergencies or whatnot. Why Miyako never used it? Because she 
didn&#39;t want to invade Maron&#39;s privacy without permission. That&#39;s all 
purely hypothetical of course, but makes some sense, yes? Then again, 
I just remember that in at least one of the episodes, Miyako showed up 
in Maron&#39;s apartment as well without being led in. I think it was the 
one with the old lady who Maron took home with her... That could have 
had numerous reasons of course.
As for the layout. I&#39;m not sure which episode it was but there was a 
shot of Maron&#39;s apartment once or twice and as much as I remember I 
believe that it is sort of divided in two levels with a few stairs 
leading upstairs, where I BELIEVE her bed is... Correct me if that 
isn&#39;t true but that&#39;s what I used as a basis here.

I realize lots of questions were left open. I am keeping the option 
for a follow-up after all, maybe a S-H-O-R-T one... right, as if that 
will happen. That depends on if she gets any more inspiration from 
watching the rest of the rerun... Maybe, I shouldn&#39;t watch to begin 
with? Nah...

Enough, it&#39;s getting late and I have typed enough. Fingers getting 
tired. Hope you liked that odd piece from Yours Truly, the master of 
strange pairings... Email me feedback, leave reviews or whatever but 
comments in whatever form if remotely constructive are always 
appreciated.

Au revoir, yours

Matthias
