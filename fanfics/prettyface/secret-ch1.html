<h1>Secret</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../prettyface/index.html">Pretty Face</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Keiko Tsukamato usually thought of herself as a fairly
average highschool girl. Admittedly she didn&#39;t care
much for boys, had a large stuffed animal collection
and also several pets, but overall she thought of
herself as being decidedly average. Which was why the
situation with her friend Yuna was SO strange!

Rina Kurimji was one of Keiko&#39;s best friends, a slim,
black haired girl with a sweet smile with a hint of
underlying sadness. Everyone knew the story of how her
twin sister Yuna had ran away from home, a tragedy
that lingered in her life, so Keiko had been startled
when Rina had suddenly arrived at school nearly
bouncing with joy.

It seemed that Rina&#39;s lost sister had been found! Rina
had ran into Yuna on the street, taking her home even
as the other girl reluctantly confessed to having
amnesia. Rina nearly seemed to float with joy as she
confessed her feelings at their being reunited, and
Keiko couldn&#39;t help feeling happy for her too.

When Keiko first met Yuna she was shocked by the
resemblance to Keiko, except for the lighter hair and
smaller bust, though she soon saw other differences as
well. Yuna seemed rougher than Rina, with a almost
steetwise edge coupled with a cute sort of innocence,
one that Keiko guessed stemmed from her amnesia. She
easily fit into their group of friends, too, pulled in
by Rina along with the other&#39;s energy.

&quot;Yuna!&quot; Keiko called, watching the slim blonde stalk
down the hallway, entirely unaware of the admiring
glances she drew. Keiko found herself noticing how
pretty Yuna was, her light brown hair gleaming, but
tried to put it out of her mind.

&quot;Hey, Keiko,&quot; Yuna smiled as they fell into step
together.

Another odd thing about Yuna was how she was treated
like royalty by the various sports clubs in the
school. Somehow Yuna had taken up the position of the
toughest person in school, a position that was
previously held by the dangerous Masashi Rando. Maybe
it was because of her time on the streets but Yuna was
a incredible fighter, one who had defeated both the
Karate and Judo clubs with ease. Now Yuna had become a
sort of idol to the sports clubs, something she seemed
rather uncomfortable with.

&quot;I have a favor to ask,&quot; Keiko admitted.

&quot;Yeah?&quot; Yuna asked, looking over at her thoughtfully.

Keiko smiled a bit, feeling embarrassed. &quot;I want to
get something for Rina,&quot; she admitted, &quot;could you come
with me to the store later?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not so good with shopping,&quot; Yuna confessed with a
wry smile, &quot;so I&#39;m not sure how much help I&#39;ll be.&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; Keiko agreed with a nod of her head, &quot;that&#39;s
why I was thinking we could put our heads together.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Yuna conceded, &quot;do you have somewhere you
wanna meet?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s start at the local mall,&quot; Keiko agreed. As they
split to go to their separate classes she mentally
checked off a certain mental list she was maintaining.
&#39;I really think she is,&#39; she mused, &#39;maybe I&#39;ll ask
her today.&#39;

Classes dragged on as Keiko waited impatiently for
class to end, dealing with the teachers politely but
with a certain distance. She got along well with her
teachers, mostly, but there were things she didn&#39;t
want them noticing or asking her about, it would make
her already complicated life more difficult.

Right on time Keiko saw Yuna walking up to their
meeting place at the mall later that day, the slightly
taller girl confidently cutting through the crowds.
Other girls might be afraid of perverts in such a
dense crowd, but something in Yuna&#39;s manner made it
clear any pervert who tried something would deeply
regret it.

&quot;So,&quot; Yuna smiled as she offered Keiko a hand and
asked, &quot;where do we want to start?&quot; With a
surprisingly smooth ease Keiko was pulled up from her
seat, almost as if Yuna did this sort of thing every
day.

&#39;For someone so slim she&#39;s pretty strong,&#39; Keiko
thought as she held Yuna&#39;s hand. Blushing a bit she
let go as she said, &quot;I thought we&#39;d start with jewelry
then look around.&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Yuna agreed as they set out.

Soon they were walking through the jewelry shop, where
Keiko was surprised to see that Yuna hadn&#39;t had her
ears pierced. &quot;I thought everyone our age had that
done,&quot; she mused as she held up a earring to Yuna&#39;s
face, trying to decide if it would look good on Rina
too.

&quot;That sort of thing&#39;s not my style,&quot; Yuna said
gruffly.

&quot;I kind of admire that,&quot; Keiko admitted as she put the
pair down and held up a dangling set of earrings, &quot;I
got mine done just because my friends were.&quot;

&quot;No dangly earrings,&quot; Yuna waved a hand as she noted,
&quot;Rina&#39;s got long enough hair they&#39;d get tangled.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s cool that you notice things like that,&quot; Keiko
smiled. In fact she had seen Yuna looking at the girls
in their group a lot, trying to do so when she thought
they weren&#39;t looking. Of course all girls did that a
little, but Yuna seemed to have a harder time hiding
it.

They moved on to the local clothing store, and Keiko
and Yuna picked though blouses. Yuna seemed to have a
good idea of what colors Rina usually wore, which
helped them narrow down some choices.

&quot;I&#39;m going to try this on,&quot; Keiko said as she picked
up a blue blouse, &quot;would you mind keeping an eye out?
I hate just depending on the door to keep anyone out.&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; Yuna gulped as they walked to the changing
room.

Once in the stall Keiko smoothly drew her shirt off,
feeling Yuna&#39;s eyes rest on her as she slid the blouse
on. &quot;Yuna?&quot; she asked.

Yuna stiffened, then turned fully towards her. &quot;Yes?&quot;
she asked nervously.

&quot;Does this color look good on me?&quot; Keiko asked, the
shirt only partially buttoned to reveal the pattern of
her bra.

Yuna&#39;s eyes widened as she saw the open shirt, then
the cutest blush appeared. &quot;It,&quot; she cleared her
throat uncomfortably, &quot;it looks nice.&quot;

&#39;I was right,&#39; Keiko thought, hiding a triumphant
smile. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said mildly, turning back to
finish changing.

They finished up their shopping, Keiko having found
one or two items they thought Rina might like, then
she suggested they might go get a snack. Yuna seemed
agreeable to that so they went to one of the mall&#39;s
cafes, each picking out a item.

Without thinking about it Yuna held out Keiko&#39;s chair,
&quot;Here ya go.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Keiko smiled up at her, seeing Yuna blush
again. &#39;She&#39;s so cute,&#39; she thought, a bit surprised
by the realization.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Yuna said as she sat down to eat.
Unlike a typical young woman she eagerly slurped her
food, clearly enjoying her meal.

Keiko ate her own food, silently debating what she
should do. &quot;Yuna,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;there was
something I wanted to talk to you about.&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Yuna looked up from her food curiously.

&quot;I think I know your secret,&quot; Keiko said to her
seriously. As Yuna&#39;s eyes widened in alarm she
continued quietly, &quot;I&#39;ve seen how you notice us girls,
your strength, politeness and so many other things,
too.&quot;

Yuna tried to look tough as she said, &quot;That doesn&#39;t
prove anything.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to hide,&quot; Keiko reached out to pat
Yuna&#39;s hand, &quot;I understand.&quot;

Yuna&#39;s mouth twisted in a odd smile, &quot;I doubt you do.&quot;

&quot;Really,&quot; Keiko smiled sweetly, &quot;you see, I&#39;m a
lesbian too.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Yuna blinked then swiftly recovered. &quot;Of course
you&#39;re right,&quot; Yuna confessed, &quot;but I never realized
you were...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not too obvious,&quot; Keiko nodded. She added,
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll keep your secret.&quot;

Yuna smiled, looking relieved, &quot;And I will too.&quot;

&quot;Yuna?&quot; Keiko asked as they finished their meals.

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Are you seeing anyone?&quot; Keiko batted her eyes.

&#39;Uh oh,&#39; Yuna sweatdropped.

End

Notes: Yuna, if you haven&#39;t READ Pretty Face yet, is
in fact Mr. Rando Masashi and is posing as Yuna for
various reasons. I rather like Keiko, and as she looks
and acts a bit like a baby dyke I thought it might
make a cute story.</pre>
