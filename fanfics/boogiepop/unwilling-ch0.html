<h2>a <a href="../boogiepop/index.html">Boogiepop Phantom</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Prelude

When Nagi Kirima told Kazuko Suema that she didn&#39;t want her to turn out 
like her, Kazuko looked at her in confusion. Nagi was out there saving 
lives, helping people in trouble, how could Kazuko not want to turn out 
like her? More importantly, Nagi had even saved her life....

Of course, Kazuko still didn&#39;t know everything that happened five years 
ago, she only had bits in pieces. A killer had been stalking young 
women, ultimately kiling himself before he was caught by the police. 
Investigating the scene of the crime they had discovered who his next 
target would have been, and shockingly it had been Kazuko herself. She 
had been stunned when she found out, and her near brush with death had 
cast a shadow of her life for five years. During that time Kazuko had 
taken up the study of criminology and psychology, trying to find out why 
she had been targeted. She wanted to understand what drove a man to 
kill, what made such men become what they were and to try to put her own 
targeting into some kind of context.

In their school Nagi was a mysterious rebel, skipping classes at will, 
breaking rules and being suspended off and on. Never expelled, however, 
because whatever else Nagi did she was a excellent student, passing her 
teast with ease despite the missed classes. Like her fellows Kazuko had 
been a little scared of Nagi, the tough girl that slept through classes 
and was broadly considered a delinquent. Of course, that was before she 
learned the truth about her.

Appearing in some kind of home made battle gear Nagi had threatened 
their classmate Kyoko Konoshita, eventually spurring her to reveal her 
involvement in drugs. Kyoko was so scared by Nagi that Kazuko was 
certain she had scared the girl straight, as well as forcing her to 
divulge clues on another case that Nagi was investigating. Shocked and a 
little fascinated Kazuko sought out Nagi&#39;s home, where she was surprised 
again by how mild mannered Nagi could be. Sitting in a bedroom set up 
like a hacker&#39;s dream Nagi had conversationally explained herself and 
her quest to fight injustice. And later, accidentally, Nagi had revealed 
that she was the one who had stopped the killer five years ago. Her and 
Boogiepop, anyway.
