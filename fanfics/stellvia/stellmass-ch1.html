<h1>A Stellar Masseuse</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../stellvia/index.html">Stellvia of the Universe</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/tsakai.html">Toshio Sakai</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Arisa Glennorth, whose hair was nearly but not quite as fiery as her 
personality, moaned and collapsed onto the bench in the changing room of 
the anti-gravity training simulators. Still a C grade, even after two 
solid weeks of agonizing training, disciplined exercises and rigorous 
routines. With mid terms scarcely a week away, the outspoken Thai girl 
wasn&#39;t sure if she would be able to pull it all together in time to 
achieve a passing score. And that meant getting left behind in repeat 
sessions while her best friend, the girl whom she admired so dearly in 
torturous confidence, blazed on ahead, as she always did, into the 
stars. Shipon.

In stark contrast to Arisa&#39;s awkward and rigid entry into the changing 
room, Shima Katase padded in quietly with the delicacy of a kitten. Dark 
chocolate twin tails bobbing daintily behind, Shipon went to her locker, 
humming softly to herself. Glennorth narrowed her eyes, dumfounded by 
Katase&#39;s sunny affectation.

&quot;Oh, Shipon! How can you be so calm and collected at a time like this?&quot; 
she whined, leaning against her own locker. &quot;I&#39;ll never be ready for the 
midterms at this rate.&quot;

Shima Katase looked surprised by Arisa&#39;s protestations as if for the 
first time acknowledging her friend was there. Then she smiled.

&quot;It really isn&#39;t so horrible, Arisa,&quot; soothed the other. &quot;You&#39;re so 
tense all the time. You just need to relax a little bit.&quot;

&quot;My, how the tables have turned,&quot; Glennorth sighed. &quot;I thought I was the 
confident one. Now look at us, you lecturing me about how to keep my 
cool.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re stiff as a board,&quot; Shima giggled. &quot;You should go down to the 
massage clinic later on. It&#39;s quite wonderful.&quot;

Arisa pouted, staring at Shipon, who continued to change out of her 
training attire. The red head gazed longingly at Shima, admiring her 
silky skin, her trim, lissome body. Shima Katase, Arisa observed, was a 
girl trapped somewhere between the formlessness of pre-pubescence and 
the nubile curves of womanhood. Formatively beautiful from head to toe 
yet completely unaware of her latent charms, Shipon was the morning of 
pale Spring unwilling to relinquish Winter&#39;s chill.

Something came over her then. An impish grin dawned upon Arisa&#39;s face. 
&quot;Why don&#39;t you give me a massage if you think I&#39;m so tense then, 
Shipon?&quot;

Shima Katase looked surprise, then a goofy look fell over her demeanor. 
&quot;You&#39;re joking right?&quot;

&quot;Wipe that silly grin off your face, Shipon!&quot; Arisa commanded austerely. 
&quot;I&#39;m quite serious. Like you said, if I&#39;m to pass these finals, then 
I&#39;ve got to relax a bit, right?&quot;

&quot;Well I guess so, but-&quot;

&quot;No one&#39;s more up to the challenge to put my taut muscles at ease than 
the cosmically talented Shima Katase.&quot;

Shima looked hesitant, motionless in mid-dress. For a moment, Arisa 
worried she&#39;d stepped too far, been too bold.

&quot;Here? Now?&quot; Shipon whispered as if someone would hear.

Arisa looked around customarily. &quot;Shipon, there&#39;s nobody here. What&#39;s 
the big deal?&quot;

The two blinked at each other in awkward silence. The drone of the 
fluorescent lightning and the faint mechanical droning of the simulators 
seemed much louder in the quietude of the changing room.

&quot;Shipon...&quot; Arisa scowled.

&quot;But Arisa,&quot; stammered Katase. &quot;I mean, you seriously want me to massage 
you?&quot;

&quot;Gosh, darn it, Shipon, you can just say no. Yeesh!&quot;

Shima writhed uncomfortably in her place. &quot;But I don&#39;t know anything 
about giving massages, Arisa,&quot; said she, unconfidently. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t even 
know where to begin.&quot;

&quot;Well here,&quot; said Arisa standing and walking over to her friend. &quot;I can 
massage you a bit... show you how and whatnot. Then you can just repeat 
the same thing on me. Okay?&quot;

Shima blushed, hastily trying to clothe herself completely in the 
standard issue Stellvia uniform for the lower classmen preparatory 
students. Glennorth shook her head.

&quot;That&#39;s not going to work, Shipon, ya big dork! How am I supposed to 
massage you with all that latex fabric between my fingers and your 
beautiful shoulders?&quot; Arisa blurted.

Katase stared hard at her friend. &quot;Wait, what?&quot;

Arisa bit her tongue, blushing. &quot;Er, what?&quot;

&quot;What did you just say, Arisa?&quot; asked Shima of her friend.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; the Thai girl groped. &quot;I say a lot of things. Most of 
the things I say don&#39;t even make any sense, least of all to me, and I 
speak so quickly that the things I say five seconds ago aren&#39;t the 
things I&#39;m really thinking anymore, so all in all, it&#39;s not really a 
good idea to put too much stock into the things I&#39;m saying, especially 
the things I said previously...&quot;

&quot;It sounded like you said &#145;beautiful shoulders&#39;,&quot; mumbled Shima, folding 
her hands in her lap and looking down at her knees.

&quot;That&#39;s ridiculous,&quot; protested the red head. &quot;Look we&#39;re getting off 
track. Pull down your uniform.&quot;

Shima flushed an uncharted shade of crimson, not budging.

&quot;Shipon,&quot; lectured Arisa. &quot;We&#39;re roommates. We&#39;re both girls. Do you 
honestly think I&#39;ve never seen your naked back before?&quot;

&quot;I guess it&#39;s alright,&quot; Shima agreed, squirming out of the uniform, but 
holding the suit to her chest.

Arisa suddenly felt afraid. Her eager fingers were inches away from 
Shima Katase&#39;s milky white skin, her supple and remarkably flawless 
flesh. It glowed with a healthy radiance, the incandescence of youth, 
and Arisa envied it. Desired to be a part of it, pressed against it. She 
wondered, given the opportunity, if she would go too far, her fingers 
straying from the innocent intent of a masseuse to become the devious 
digits of a lover. But oh how she longed to explore every inch, nook and 
cranny of her friend&#39;s body, to feel the warmth of skin against skin, 
the beating of two hearts as one.

&quot;A-alright,&quot; Glennorth said at last. &quot;This is how you give someone a 
good massage.&quot;

Slowly, Arisa Glennorth&#39;s fingers fell upon Shima&#39;s skin, gently 
caressing and exploring for the first time the ambit of her friend&#39;s 
slender back. Gently and daintily her digits glided along the pronounced 
hillocks of the girl&#39;s shoulder blades, down the flat of her back, and 
up the gently sloping valley in the center. The red head noticed Shima 
had shut her eyes, and was blushing deeply.

&quot;Uh, does it... feel good?&quot; Arisa questioned.

Shima nodded mutely. Glennorth took this as her cue to continue. Fingers 
curled about Shima&#39;s neck, delicately kneading the muscle about her 
collar bone, lightly tracing shapes around the hollow beneath her chin, 
and back to the outermost reaches of her shoulders.

&quot;A...Arisa,&quot; Shima whispered.

&quot;What is it, Shipon?&quot;

&quot;You... you&#39;re really good at this...&quot;

Arisa Glennorth smirked. &quot;Yeah, well, I&#39;ve had practice. I may not be 
good at anti gravity simulators or software program development, but 
massage and reiki is something I think I&#39;m really good at.&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Shima urged. &quot;Don&#39;t stop. Keep going.&quot;

The red head realized that during her bragging she&#39;d stopped rubbing her 
friend&#39;s back, so she continued, this time her fingers slightly more 
daring, prodding up and down Katase&#39;s spindly arms and sides. Each time 
Arisa&#39;s fingers discovered her flanks, Shipon wiggled away giggling 
softly.

&quot;That tickles,&quot; she said.

&quot;But it feels good, right?&quot;

&quot;Well yes, but-&quot;

&quot;Then hush,&quot; replied Arisa.

In the dim atmosphere of the changing area, Arisa and Shima had 
unknowingly entered an intimate world, a dimension where the love and 
affection between friends was the singular, most powerful force in the 
universe. Only in such close proximity, in the sheltering seclusion of 
the locker room, could the unadulterated bond between two adolescent 
girls blossom into a union of two young hearts.

Suddenly, Shima Katase gasped. &quot;Arisa!&quot;

Coming back to her senses, the red head realized her hands had roamed 
unbidden onto the silky smooth mounds of Shima&#39;s pert breasts. She 
snatched her hands away quickly, mortified.

&quot;Sh-Shipon! I didn&#39;t mean to! I wasn&#39;t paying attention!&quot;

&quot;Arisa...&quot; Shima whispered. &quot;I... I need to ask you something.&quot;

The red haired girl froze and paled. A chill ran up her spine as she 
felt an uncomfortable tension between the two girls.

&quot;We&#39;re really good friends, right?&quot; Shima said softly.

&quot;Of course,&quot; agreed Arisa carefully.

&quot;And friends tell each other the truth. No matter what.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I guess they do.&quot;

There was a pause, a hesitancy in Shima&#39;s demeanor.

&quot;Arisa... do you... do you like me?&quot;

&quot;Of course I like you, Shipon,&quot; said Arisa nervously.

The brunette shook her head. &quot;That&#39;s not what I mean. I mean do you like 
me?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re my best friend, Shima,&quot; Arisa said at length. &quot;Of course I like 
you. You mean the universe to me.&quot; You are my universe, she added in her 
mind.

Shima stood up and turned to face her friend resolutely. She squared her 
jaw and tried to look stern. &quot;Arisa, don&#39;t you understand what I&#39;m 
asking you?&quot;

Arisa couldn&#39;t bring herself to match Shima&#39;s gaze. Eyes welling up with 
tears, she leaned against Shima&#39;s locker, looking at the floor. There 
was no avoiding it; the question was clear, and Glennorth was being 
unfairly evasive.

&quot;Oh, Shipon,&quot; she whispered at last. &quot;It... it&#39;s true... I... I&#39;m in 
love with you. I always have been. From the first day we met on the 
NASCA shuttle to Foundation 2 I knew that we would be great friends. 
But... but I never knew you&#39;d make me feel... feel so alive... so 
comfortable and warm inside.&quot; She looked up at last, tears running down 
her burning cheeks. &quot;Shima Katase, my heart is and always will be yours. 
I&#39;m sorry... if... if you don&#39;t want to be friends anymore I&#39;ll 
understand-&quot;

What happened next happened as if it were a dream, a beautiful fantasy 
conjured by the heart of lustful teen girl. Shima Katase leaned forward 
and cut her friend off mid sentence as she locked lips with Arisa. 
Holding the girl&#39;s tear-stained face with her hands, Shima shut her eyes 
and kissed her best friend, slipping her tongue deftly into Arisa&#39;s 
mouth, exploring the hot cavern of the girl&#39;s throat. When she pulled 
back, their lips were still connected by a shimmering tendril of saliva. 
Arisa&#39;s entire face was rigid with shock and disbelief.

&quot;I... I&#39;m dreaming...&quot; was all the Thai girl could utter.

Shima smiled angelically. &quot;I know you&#39;ve always wanted to kiss me like 
that,&quot; she cooed.

&quot;You do?&quot; wondered Arisa, still doubting the palpability of the entire 
situation.

&quot;You left your diary open on my bed one night. I... I couldn&#39;t help 
noticing a giant heart drawn around my name as I was closing it...&quot;

Glennorth looked mortified. &quot;You... how much... how much did you read?&quot;

Shima took Arisa&#39;s hands in her own. &quot;Enough to know that you fantasize 
about me daily, Arisa...&quot;

Arisa Glennorth&#39;s face turned a vivid shade of mauve. &quot;Oh my God, I&#39;m so 
embarrassed,&quot; she stammered.

&quot;Don&#39;t be!&quot; Shima interjected. &quot;I&#39;m really flattered, Arisa. Honest.&quot;

&quot;You... you are?&quot;

Shima nodded. &quot;Mm hmm. And do you know what else?&quot;

Glennorth shook her head, no.

&quot;I think you&#39;re really pretty too...&quot;

This time, both girls blushed. Arisa&#39;s mind reeled with the intensity of 
these recent confessions. Unless this was a torturous dream, her best 
friend, the girl whom she loved body and soul, was standing before her, 
half naked, completely accepting of Arisa&#39;s love and even encouraging it 
with her own, likeminded reflections.

Arisa shook her head in disbelief and sat down on the bench beside 
Shima. &quot;Pinch me, this can&#39;t be real...&quot;

Shipon rested her head upon Arisa&#39;s right shoulder. &quot;Why can&#39;t it, 
Arisa? I mean... we&#39;re best friends. Can&#39;t we be open about everything?&quot;

&quot;Shipon,&quot; replied the other, &quot;I don&#39;t think you really get it. I&#39;m crazy 
for you. I&#39;m not joking at all. Do you understand what I mean?&quot;

Katase nodded sagely. &quot;I do understand. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s wrong at all. 
I don&#39;t think you should hide it. You care about me more than anyone. 
More than Kouta even.&quot;

&quot;You like Kouta,&quot; Arisa muttered. &quot;Anyone can see that.&quot;

&quot;I admire him,&quot; agreed Shipon. &quot;But more in a brotherly way. He&#39;s far 
more mature than I am, and the chemistry between us doesn&#39;t transcend 
friendship.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Glennorth wondered. &quot;I was so sure you two were a thing...&quot;

&quot;Do you want to make love to me, Arisa?&quot; Shima asked bluntly.

A bead of sweat formed beside Arisa&#39;s face as she flushed deeply, her 
cheeks rife with embarrassment. &quot;Are... are you kidding?&quot;

&quot;Well in your journal you wrote that-&quot;

&quot;Oh for heaven&#39;s sake I know what I wrote!&quot; moaned Arisa. &quot;I can&#39;t 
believe you read that! How... how much did you read?&quot;

&quot;Up to the part where you said you wanted to taste my-&quot;

&quot;Oh jeez,&quot; Arisa groaned, mortified. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you read all of 
that...&quot;

&quot;I hear you whisper my name sometimes when you masturbate at night,&quot; 
Shima added.

Arisa blinked. &quot;W-w-what?&quot;

Shima turned and rotated her body on the bench, stripping the rest of 
the way out of her uniform. Arisa looked away, horrified.

&quot;Sh-Shipon!&quot; she cried. &quot;What are you... get dressed! You c-can&#39;t just-&quot;

&quot;Oh come on, Arisa,&quot; Katase grinned. &quot;You wrote that you wanted to stick 
your tongue inside my pussy; this is your chance.&quot;

Her hands trembling, the butterflies in her stomach fluttering about 
with the force of a tempestuous gale, Arisa turned back to face her 
naked friend.

&quot;Are... are you serious about this, Shipon?&quot;

Shima nodded, blushing. &quot;Of course I am. But only if you&#39;ll let me do 
the same to you.&quot;

Arisa nodded. Gently easing Shima back onto the bench, she hastily 
removed her own uniform. Her small, rosy nipples instantly became erect 
in the cool air of the changing room. As Shima spread her legs, Arisa 
took a moment to admire the girl&#39;s creamy thighs, boyishly pretty 
buttocks and the silky black tuft of pubic hair just above her furled 
opening. Already Katase&#39;s outer lips were slightly lubricated by the 
honey of her arousal.

Straddling the bench, Arisa bent down, positioning each of Shima&#39;s legs 
over her own shoulders. She gently parted Katase&#39;s labia with her 
fingers, exposing the sensitive walls of the girl&#39;s young vulva.

Shima mewed softly. &quot;Arisa...&quot; she whispered. &quot;Don&#39;t look... it&#39;s 
embarrassing.&quot;

As if in direct contradiction of her friend&#39;s plea, the red haired girl 
slowly traced her tongue along the insides of Shima&#39;s parted thighs, 
circling the shadowy chasm of her pussy. Katase moaned with pleasure, 
goose bumps rising upon every inch of her exposed skin. Encouraged by 
Shima&#39;s reaction to her ministrations, Arisa&#39;s tongue, emboldened and 
determined, wiggled inside of Katase&#39;s moist furrow.

&quot;Nggyaaaaah!&quot; the girl cried out, clenching her fists, her pelvis 
twitching at the sudden entry of her friend&#39;s tongue into her body. 
&quot;Arisa! I can feel you inside of me!&quot;

Arisa took care to lap up every rivulet of juice that Shipon&#39;s spasming 
cunt secreted. She withdrew her tongue and licked the liquid from her 
lips.

&quot;You taste incredible, Shipon,&quot; commented Glennorth.

With her right hand, Arisa slid two fingers delicately inside of Shima&#39;s 
pouting sex while inserting the same two fingers of her left hand inside 
of her own, moistening snatch. Katase began to buck her hips against the 
rhythm of Arisa&#39;s fingers. Surprised by the squishing noises produced by 
her own, aroused pussy, the red head flexed her own inner muscles, 
gripping her digits tightly as she finger-fucked herself hastily seeking 
orgasm.

&quot;It feels so good!&quot; moaned Shima.

&quot;Your pussy is so hot,&quot; Arisa panted. &quot;I&#39;m so wet, Shima. You turn me on 
so much!&quot;

&quot;F-fuck me deeper!&quot;

&quot;Mm! Like this?&quot;

A scream of pure pleasure. &quot;Haaaaaaa! Right there! D-don&#39;t stop! Right 
t-there Arisa! You&#39;re hitting my spot!&quot;

Squish. Sphlisssh. The sounds of two swollen, juicy pussies being pumped 
echoed through the room. Throaty cries of titillation hung in the air 
like the dew of Shipon&#39;s honey pot from Arisa&#39;s dexterous fingers.

&quot;My...my clit!&quot; Shima whimpered. &quot;I feel like it&#39;s going to explode!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m close too!&quot; said Arisa between moans. &quot;I... so close... my whole 
body!&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t hold on any longer Arisa!&quot;

&quot;Oh Shipon!&quot;

&quot;Arisa!&quot;

&quot;Come all over my face, my little Shipon!&quot;

The invitation to climax all over her friend&#39;s face sent Shima Katase 
over the edge. Arisa bent down and stuck her tongue deep inside the 
quivering nether chasm of her best friend as a warm, sticky jet of girl 
cum exploded forth and into her mouth. The culmination of Shima&#39;s orgasm 
caused Arisa&#39;s own body to reach its sexual zenith, and she herself 
withdrew her fingers from her cunt and a river of clear love juice 
spurted forth and onto the locker room bench. After riding the intensity 
of their climaxes for nearly a minute, Arisa collapsed on top of Shima, 
skin against skin, breast against breast. As their heartbeats slowed, 
they stared into each other&#39;s sparkling eyes.

&quot;Shipon,&quot; Arisa whispered. &quot;That was incredible.&quot; She kissed Katase&#39;s 
lips softly. &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Shima nodded, then inclined her head, nibbling softly at Arisa&#39;s ear 
lobe for a moment before whispering in her ear, &quot;There&#39;s only one small, 
minor problem.&quot;

Arisa looked at her friend bemusedly. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;

Shipon giggled. &quot;I still haven&#39;t given you a massage!&quot;</pre>
