<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>Kurusugawa
Himeko couldn’t sleep. It had been hours since she first laid her back upon the
soft mattress. Yet, all she managed to do was toss and turn and watch the hands
of the grandfather clock standing across her bed go round. She sighed. It was
four in the morning already, and school was but a few hours away. Should this
continue, there was no doubt she would be nodding off during classes. Worse,
today she would be having World History and Classic Literature, the two
subjects that had never failed to induce sleepiness despite her efforts to stay
awake. Her heart throbbed. Despite the fact that those classes were
mind-numbingly boring, she had never landed herself into trouble even once.
Whenever Himeko dozed off on her desk, Mako-chan would wake her before the
teacher found out. Whenever Himeko was called upon to read some paragraphs in
the text, which she had no idea where, Mako-chan would whisper the page number
and kept Himeko’s hide preserved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Mako-chan,
where are you? </span></i>Himeko thought. She had asked Chikane-chan to take
her to the hospital once so that she could try to mend her friendship with the
track-and-field athlete. To her disappointment, the nurse at the reception
desk, who glanced at her and the blue-haired princess in a very funny way,
announced that the patient named Saotome Makoto didn’t want any visitors. There
was nothing Himeko could do except leaving the hospital with a heart that was
drowned in grief. She had cried her eyes out on Chikane-chan’s shoulder during
the trip home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Sighing again, Himeko rose from the bed and walked out of her
room. In her pajama, she quietly treaded upon the spacious and empty hallways,
climbed down the flight of marble stairs leading toward the deserted Main Hall,
opened a glass door at a corner, and finally arrived at the back garden of the
Himemiya Mansion. Shaped in one great square spanning half a square mile in
area, the garden was a vast verdant field where flowers, arranged in an
eye-pleasing way atop the lush lawn that shone with the color of emeralds under
the sun light, thrived and spread their pleasant fragrance across the land.
Even right now, in the darkness before dawn that was only diluted by the light
of the lamp posts, the garden seemed just as beautiful. Actually, Himeko
thought it was even more so with the nocturnal atmosphere it gave out, with the
sense of serenity that permeated the air, and with Chikane-chan, Himeko’s
sweetheart, who was sitting on a bench near a gushing fountain, beneath the
light of a lamp post.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Why are you not in bed, Himeko?” the blue-haired princess
smiled tenderly at Himeko upon her approach. Chikane-chan was wearing her usual
night gown under a long-sleeved coat that draped across her slender shoulders,
appearing as beautiful and coolly elegant as ever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I can’t sleep,” Himeko admitted truthfully. “How about you,
Chikane-chan? Why are you still awake?” She sat down next to her beloved on the
bench, at which point she started to wonder how it would feel to link arms with
the blue-haired princess and rest her head on the girl’s slender shoulder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The other girl studied her with an expressionless face for a
long moment before she spoke quietly, “I could not sleep either, so I came here
to have some fresh air, hoping it would drive my restlessness away.” The
princess’s beautiful sapphire eyes, once locked with Himeko’s amethyst, now
looked away and focused on the sprays of water rising from the fountainhead, a
French horn held by the stone statue of a little angel. Although Himeko wanted
to ask what had caused Chikane-chan’s restlessness, she forbore. There was a
note in the other girl’s voice that made it clear that even if Himeko had
inquired, she would not have received a straightforward answer. She but
wondered why.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Did it help, then, Chikane-chan?” Himeko asked, deciding to
leave the topic alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“A little bit,” the princess confided with a sweet smile. “I
think that I will be able to sleep<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>
if</span></i> I go back to bed now.” She glanced at the watch on her left
wrist. “I do not think I will, though.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Why not?” Himeko asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Because I would have to wake up half an hour later, Himeko,”
Chikane-chan said in a depressed voice. “I have a studying session scheduled
with the MBA people from five to seven, you see.” The princess winced slightly
as if the thought of having to attend the session was a needle that just
pricked her skin. She shivered, too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Himeko gave a start. “They are going to tutor you this
morning, too?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Not just this morning, <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>every</span></i>
morning thereafter,” the princess corrected her with a rueful smile. “You know
that I always wake up at five for archery practice, do you not?” Chikane-chan
waited for a nod from Himeko before she continued, “My father decided that my <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>hobby</span></i> was not as important
as studying business, so he allocated the time slot from five to seven for my
tutoring session regardless of my wish.” She heaved a long sigh that spoke volumes
of the desperation and frustration she had to be feeling inside. Himeko’s heart
went out to her. Maybe this was why her beloved princess couldn’t sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You don’t even <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>like</span></i>
the subject, Chikane-chan, I can tell,” she commented quietly, her hand on the
princess’s shoulder. “Why do you have to work yourself so... murderously?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Because my Father failed to understand his daughter the way
you understand me, my dearest friend.” The blue-haired girl let out a long sigh
as she took Himeko’s hand into her own and squeezed it tenderly. “He simply
assumed that since I was good at it, there was no reason I could not come to
love it. Sometimes I wonder which one is closer to me, you, or my father.” Her
expression, once sad, grew softer, and much more affectionate when her sapphire
eyes settled upon Himeko’s face. Her heart skipped a beat. The princess looked
so beautiful when she said that....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Why don’t you tell him what you just told me?” Himeko said,
trying to slow down her racing pulse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I did try, Himeko,” the Himemiya Ojou-sama answered wryly.
“His Mightiness Himemiya Kyou simply refused to accept <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>No</span></i> for an answer, you see.”
She gave her lips a thoughtful tap. “It was rather unusual, anyhow, for my
parents had never forced me to do what I did not want to before.” She gave
Himeko a soft smile. “I guess they are not letting me have my way any longer.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I’m sorry to hear that, Chikane-chan,” Himeko said to her
secret crush.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Do not be.” The blue-haired princess chuckled softly behind
a raised hand. “I would say that it was the duty given to me the moment of my
birth, Himeko. It was my <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>fate</span></i>
to become the next successor to the throne of the empire my family had built
and maintained. I cannot escape it.” Her voice suddenly turned sorrowful. “Just
as I cannot escape the fact that I was born a <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>girl</span></i>,
and thus would never be able to....” Her eyes were on Himeko once more the
moment she blinked and closed her mouth with an audible click of her teeth, her
beautiful face as blank as a sheet of paper. The princess appeared someone who
just realized that she had said too much.... Himeko only wondered what the girl
could have meant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Chikane-chan cleared her throat. “Let us drop this depressing
topic, Himeko. Why don’t I show you something fun?” she said in such a cheerful
voice and with a bright expression on her face that she almost seemed a
different person. The melancholy that had been ailing her since Himeko set foot
on the garden might as well never have existed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“What is it?” Himeko asked, feeling her mind reeling with
questions that she did not dare ask.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“A little trick I just discovered that I could do, Himeko,”
answered the Himemiya princess, her lips curving upward in a little mysterious
smile as her hand rose over her head. Silver light, glaring and cool, erupted
from the ground beneath the blue-haired girl’s feet and then gathered into a
revolving Moon Crest that kept expanding within every passing second. In a few
heartbeats, the glowing sign had enveloped the entire garden of the Himemiya.
With the ground alight, the night seemed almost insignificant. Yet, as Himeko’s
amethyst gaze rose to meet Chikane-chan’s sapphire, she realized that no light,
no matter how brilliant, could ever outshine her princess.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>A miracle happened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Water from the pond and the fountainhead, along with the dew
on the blades of grass and the leaves of the trees in the garden, rose upward
in droplets that twinkled like real stars beneath the heavily clouded heavens.
Himeko could only marvel in wonder as the rising rain all around her
concentrated into a growing sphere stationed in the air, an inch above the
blue-haired girl’s palm, which was facing skyward. When the sphere became large
enough to easily swallow up a hundred people, the princess let her fingertips
brush gently against its surface, her smile unwavering on her lips. After a
flash of silver light, the sphere shot upward so quickly Himeko’s eyes could
barely follow the thing’s trajectory path. Still, she was able to notice it
when the water sphere stopped abruptly in midair, probably a few hundred feet
above the ground. There, it exploded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>It was like watching firework, Himeko said to herself. Except
that no firework could be as spectacular as what Chikane-chan had hurled into
the sky, for in the exact instant following the explosion, a stunning vision
rippled across the ocean of dark clouds that had swallowed the moon and stars.
During that very instant, which seemed to last an eternity in her mind, Himeko
caught a glimpse of something that could rarely be seen above the skyscrapers
of Mahoroba, that which were exiled by the glaring city lights. It was the
sight of the grand Milky Way, surrounded by a sparkling star ocean the beauty
of which was seldom matched. Himeko’s breath caught. Having only seen this in
TV, she had thought that unless she gathered enough money to travel to some
vast empty land where the human population was scarce, she would never see it
in real life. She had never imagined it could be so beautiful. Her eyes once
again found her princess, who was studying her with a joyous expression on her
face. Himeko had never imagined Chikane-chan could do something so wondrous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Where did you learn to do this?” Himeko breathed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Not answering the question immediately, the blue-haired
princess turned her gaze upward at the clouded skies, from where, as Himeko
just noticed, countless droplets of sparkling water were thundering toward the
ground. Fingertips alight, the hand of Himeko’s sweetheart elegantly drew a
circle that blazed silver atop her magnificent head. The shining rain, each droplet
of which was falling down in a straight line, suddenly changed direction and
poured gently into the pond.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Afterwards, the princess gave Himeko an apologetic smile and
said, “I do not have a clue, Himeko. Ever since I brought you home from the
amusement park two days ago, strange knowledge has been coming into my head
from only the Gods know where.” She looked at her fingertips, glowing brilliant
silver under the light of the lamp posts. “I guess that means my powers are
returning.” Her gaze became distant, her expression once again blank. At times
like this, Himeko could never tell what the Priestess of the Moon was
thinking... and it bothered her a lot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Giving her head a firm shake to clear her thoughts, Himeko
sighed. “At east <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>yours</span></i>
are. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Mine</span></i> aren’t.
I wish I could do something like that, too.” She had asked herself numerous
times why she could not wield even the smallest bit of her powers, which
Oogami-sensei claimed to be more than enough to overwhelm perhaps <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>all living Orochi at once</span></i>.
It wasn’t that she doubted the High Priest... but it was very hard to imagine
that she, a girl who could barely keep herself from getting hurt, could defeat
one Follower, much less all eight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Do you think that these powers are truly desirable, Himeko?”
the princess asked, her sapphire eyes on Himeko’s face, her voice strangely
quiet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You don’t think so.” A shake of the other girl’s magnificent
head confirmed Himeko’s observation. “Why?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Do you not think that our lives would be much better without
our Priestess powers?” said the blue-haired princess. “We would be able to
remain normal girls who were not burdened by the mission of saving the world.
We would not have to lead a life where we spend every moment awake being afraid
that the Orochi could come after us.” Chikane-chan’s glowing hand curled into a
fist. “Besides, what use do I have of this? Why should I even <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>want</span></i> it when it cannot make
my one and only wish come true?” Despair was all that flowed in the princess’s
words. She made Himeko’s heart clench.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“What is it you wish for, Chikane-chan?” Himeko asked. What
could have upset her sweetheart so?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The other girl didn’t answer. Instead, she eyed Himeko up and
down as if for the first time she had noticed that Himeko was there. Then the
Himemiya Ojou-sama sat a bit closer, took off her outer coat, and draped it
across Himeko’s shoulders. “You did not dress warm enough for this kind of
weather, Himeko. Do try to take care of yourself. I will not be around forever,
you know,” she murmured softly as she helped Himeko button up the coat. Their
bodies were so close together that Himeko could feel the warmth emanating from
the princess’s skin and hear the girl’s heartbeat. When Himeko looked up and
found the blue-haired girl’s stunning face, which was but two inches apart from
her own, she realized she could feel the girl’s hot, fragrant breath caressing
her cheeks. Her heart went wild.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I can’t imagine what the servants in your house would say if
they saw us like this, Chikane-chan,” Himeko mumbled, her face a roaring furnace.
“There are enough rumors about us going around already.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“What rumors?” the princess gave her a quizzical look.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“They made all sorts of speculations as to why you brought a
stranger like me into your house, Chikane-chan,” Himeko said, her amethyst eyes
locked with the princess’s sapphire. She simply couldn’t tear them away. “Some
said I was your long-lost half-sister, born of your father and his secret
mistress.” The corners of Chikane-chan’s lovely mouth quirked upward in
amusement. “Some said I was some sort of witch who had confounded your mind.”
The blue-haired girl’s smile faded, her visage hardened in anger. Himeko took a
deep breath. “But the majority of them believed I was your secret lover.” The
expression on the face of the Himemiya Ojou-sama turned unreadable. Right at
this moment, she betrayed as much emotion as a rock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Is that so?” was the only response Himeko got. The other
girl’s voice was guarded and perfectly neutral. Himeko winced. If Chikane-chan
kept being so cautious and tight-mouthed about this, how the heck could Himeko
learn how much she was worth in her beloved’s heart?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Speaking of which,” Himeko decided to try again, “What kind
of person do you want for a lover, Chikane-chan? I really want to know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

you not try to stay with your boyfriend all the time? He may try to cheat on

it was only right for her to reject her childhood friend, as she only wished to
be with her one and only princess, as she didn’t think she could be anyone
else’s girlfriend, and as Chikane-chan was the only person that was in Himeko’s
mind, dreaming or awake. Yet... Himeko couldn’t help but be saddened... for she
knew she was going to hurt someone she cherished, someone who would fight his
own blood brother for her sake. The guilt had been devouring Himeko inside out
ever since she returned home less than twenty-four hours ago.</p>

the Immortals of Heaven had implanted within the girl three thousand years ago,
in the aftermath of the great battle between Ame no Murakumo and Yamata no
Orochi. A wave of disgust seized Yue. Although that <i><span style='font-family:
"Footlight MT Light"'>vicious thing </span></i>had been suppressed and placed
within a stasis field of powers the very moment Yue invoked her divine call to
awaken the two Priestesses, <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>it</span></i>
was now trying to come back to life. It was inevitable that <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>it</span></i> was going to break free
from the chains Chikane had unconsciously created. It was but a matter of time
until the cogs of Fate turned once more and crushed the children in its path.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>Little Chikane had done almost an impossible job by resisting
the mechanism for so long... yet it was a losing battle in the first place, for
there was a limit to what the child could accomplish. True, Chikane’s
potential, that of mankind’s strongest, was as vast as any ocean... but the
struggle against oneself was ever easier said than done. Her powers,
transcendental as they were, had but been <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>dried
up</span></i> just from sealing the mechanism away. That was why at the time of
awakening, she was powerless despite the fact that had she been able to unleash
all she was capable of, all eight Orochi Followers would have perished under
her hand.</p>

The Priestess of the Sun, little Kurusugawa Himeko, was traveling in Yue’s
direction. In but a few minutes, the child would arrive at this exact spot. Yue
sighed. She could not afford to be found out. Once she had laid the blue-haired
princess in her arms onto the carpeted floor, Yue backed up a few steps and
wove a Dimensional Portal to take her out of this place. Before the silvery
surface winked out of existence, she was allowed another quick glance at her
the unconscious Priestess. Her eyes stung once more. She had been crying a
great deal these days. She knew what would come to pass, she knew her beloved
children were about to be devastated again yet.... What meaning was there in
her being a Goddess when she could not even protect the feelings little Himeko
and Chikane had for each other? What was the use of living an immortal life
when she had to see the tragedy repeat over and over? Tears trickled down her
face uncontrollably. Yue... Yue did not want to give up on the two of them the
way she had surrendered her one true love.</p>

glanced at the grandfather clock standing across from the bed, which read eight
thirty in the morning. The first class at Ototachibana Academy started at nine,
so unless the little angel hurried, she was going to be either locked out of
the entrance or penalized academically when she got to the classroom late.
Should worse come to worst, the golden-haired girl might just have to stand in
the hallway until the teacher let her in. Chikane did not wish to see that.</p>

Still in her flimsy pajama and the coat Chikane had put on her earlier, the
little angel appeared shaken to the core.</p>

golden-haired girl a grateful smile and an affectionate squeeze of her hand.
The Priestess of the Sun actually had done more than enough. According to the
servants, she was the one who had found Chikane lying unconscious in the
hallway, who had brought Chikane back to this very room and called for help.
When Chikane first regained consciousness, the first person she had seen was
Himeko, sitting on a chair by the bed. The golden-haired girl’s cheeks were
soaked with tears, her visage contorted by fear and agony, her hands wrapping
very tightly around Chikane’s very own. Nothing in this whole wide world had
ever moved Chikane as deeply as the little angel did. “I am truly thankful that
you have stayed by my side ever since I woke, Himeko.”</p>

have remained so calm when she opened her eyes and realized that she could lift
a finger. Her limbs were entirely without strength, her back burning hot while
every other spot on her skin was as cold as ice, and her every single particle
ringing out in the pain that was nettling her heart. Had the welling panic in
her not been suppressed by the sight of a worried Himeko, Chikane could not
imagine how she would have reacted.</p>

against her tear-stained cheek. “Besides, how can I go to class and listen to
the lectures when I’m so worried about you?” Chikane’s heart started to pound.</p>

very reluctant voice. “But I’m not going back to class after lunch break,
Chikane-chan. I’m coming home to see you.” The angel’s pretty face firmed with
determination, which told Chikane that nothing she said was going to make her
sweetheart change her mind. She could only sigh inwardly at the girl’s
stubbornness. Oh well, there was nothing else she could do.</p>

Makoto had rarely been impressed in her entire life, but right now, she could
only marvel at the amazingly beautiful scenery her eyes were showing her. Under
the light of the golden sun reigning amid a cloudless sky, the castles of
Heaven, built in Feudal Japan’s fashion, loomed over her majestically while the
tiles on their roofs, seemingly made out of colorful glass, gleamed like a
collection of jewels. Even the regular houses in this place, despite being so
much smaller in size, brimmed with an unmistakable artistic sense and elegance.
Lines of trees, tall and old, ran along either side of any road, casting their
cool shade upon a perfectly and evenly paved ground. In no where could Makoto
detect the rowdiness and disorder usually associated with a city of this size.
In no where could she found even the smallest scrap of garbage that normally
littered the alleys and small streets in Mahoroba. This place, in other words,
were unnaturally and eerily clean. Even the air she breathed in exhilarated her
no end.<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'> The Immortals sure

girl was doing right now....<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'> </span></i>In
spite of herself, she gave a rueful chuckle. She came to Heaven to accomplish
the mission that the Dark God had given her, so she really didn’t have time to
moon over the one she loved. After she had given her head a firm shake to clear
unwanted thoughts, Makoto fixed her gaze upon the sole building that stood upon
this vast, empty square. The Memories Hall of Heaven, the place where the Gods
and Goddesses archived and backed up the memory of every being in the Three
Worlds, the only building that was protected by a myriad of magical Barriers.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Makoto let out a quiet, but contemptuous laughter. The
Immortals had paid a great deal of efforts trying to conceal the traps they had
woven around the Hall, but to Makoto, to whom the power of Tasogare the
Twilight Blade was bestowed, what they did was useless. Her eyes, once as blind
as those of a mortal, were now capable of visually detecting any Seal or
Barrier regardless of how well they had been hidden beforehand. Not just that,
she could even destroy them all should she choose to do so. After all, if she
had succeeded in breaking through the Dimensional Boundary protecting Izumo
itself, there was little else she could <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>not</span></i>
do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“Lord of
the Shadows, come forth, Tasogare!”</span></i> At her call, the Sealed Sword,
the blade of which was as black as the night, leapt from her shadow and into
her hand. It was time to do what she came here for.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Makoto walked straight toward the Memories Hall. The Barriers
twisted and turned upon her entrance, retreating from her steps as if nobles
making way for their queen. Soon enough, the power of the Twilight Blade
encompassed them completely, bending them to her will so that no alarms would
be sounded as long as Makoto wished. Smiling in sheer satisfaction, she turned
into a shadow and slipped past the crack between the closed doors. Having made
certain that there was no presence of power inside, Makoto knew for sure that
nothing was going to stop her from getting what the Orochi Lord required.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'>From the outside, the Memories Hall looked just like any
other building she had seen in Mahoroba, yet within its walls lay a vast ocean
the water of which sparkled platinum under a cloudless, sunless, cerulean sky.
Upon that shining and rippling surface floated an island, a large platform that
was made entirely out of marble polished so well it shone like a gigantic
mirror, on which Makoto stood. At the center of the island, next to Makoto, was
a block of transparent crystal about four feet high, two feet wide, and two
feet thick. This block, according to Yamata no Orochi, was called the One
Terminal, the device through which all functions of the Hall of Memories could
be accessed. It was exactly what Makoto needed.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>She placed her palm atop the One Terminal and channeled her
powers into the thing. Slowly, her hand sank into the crystal block. The device
started to glow. Somewhere to Makoto’s right, a globe of the mysterious
substance that made of the entire Sea of Memories rose into the air and floated
toward her.</p>

the top of the building, Kagutsuchi the God of Fire chuckled while he watched
the girl in the black cape exit the Memories Hall, completely unaware that she
was being spied upon. Strong as she was for an Orochi Head, she lacked
experience. Still, Kagutsuchi had to commend her on having succeeded in
breaching the Dimensional Boundary separating Izumo and the Earth. It was, after
all, a feat no mortal had ever managed without facing eventual and gruesome
demise. Had Kagutsuchi not seen her by pure chance, he would never have known
that such a cute and elegant girl had entered the Holy City. She was exactly
the type he would go for. He sighed. Too bad the Goddesses in Izumo were too <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>tamed</span></i> for his taste.
Otherwise, he would have a girlfriend, or even a wife, long since. But anyhow,
the Orochi girl should be thankful that Kagutsuchi was interested in what her
business was. Had it not been for that, he would have destroyed her.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The girl raised her hand, in which materialized a sword the
blade of which so black it seemed to be sucking in Izumo’s sunlight. Then space
itself <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>rippled</span></i> in
front of her to form a dimensional cleft in the shape of an oversized window.
As soon as she entered, the portal thinned into a black line and vanished.
Extremely well-done, quick, and clean, Kagutsuchi thought. The girl was truly
in control of her own powers, and the Twilight Blade obeyed her every whim.
Kagutsuchi doubted that any other Orochi Head in her place could have done half
as well. He wondered what her name was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“Come
inside the Hall, Kagutsuchi-san,” </span></i>the voice of Susanou the God of
Storms spoke suddenly inside Kagutsuchi’s head and made him jump.<i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'> “We need to talk.” </span></i>For the
first time since he landed on top of the lone building standing dead center of
the Ko no Hana Grand Square, he sensed the presence of his twin right beneath
his feet. A chill ran down his spine.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Since when did you get in your office, Susanou?” he demanded
upon arriving at the marble platform that floated upon the peaceful surface of
the Kiokkai. His brother, the handsome God of Storms was sitting on a
high-backed chair in front of the One Terminal, both hands immersed within the
shining crystal device.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

text-indent:.5in'>“I was inside the Kannazuki Tower, deep beneath the surface
of the Memories Sea, Kagutsuchi-san,” the other man said nonchalantly. “No one
could have noticed me there.” Of course, the Tower of the Godless Month<i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'> </span></i>was protected by its
engine, an immense power the existence of which was unknown to the majority of
Izumo’s residents. That power, evil and malicious, must have cloaked Susanou’s
presence from Kagutsuchi’s senses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Because I know exactly what she came here to take,” came the
monotonous reply. “Coincidentally, it was a package that needed to be
delivered. In fact, she had saved me the trouble of sending it out myself.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“This,” replied Susanou at the same time a second holographic
screen appeared to the left of the first one. Kagutsuchi read it... and became
dumbstruck. According to the onscreen text, which happened to be extracted from
the activity log file of the archive, what the Orochi girl had taken from the
Kiokkai was the memory belonging to Sei no Tsurugi no Rinne, the Seraphim Blade.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“What the hell?” he said in utmost incredulity. “That girl
risked her life coming to Heaven just to steal something she <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>cannot</span></i> use? Didn’t she read
the Kiokkai Rules before she tampered with the machine? And why Rin-chan’s
memory, of all people?” Only after the questions had leapt from Kagutsuchi’s
tongue did the explanations come to him like the breaking dawn. As a result, he
fell silent afterwards, suddenly overwhelmed by a wave of relief that he hadn’t
lifted a hand against the girl in the black cape. Had he done so, he would have
committed a terrible crime against someone he once cherished with all his
heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Because Rinne-kun wants the thing, obviously,” answered the
other man in his usual lecturing tone. Despite the fact that Kagutsuchi loved
his brother, he had never been able to make himself come to terms with the
man’s condescending attitude. “<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Yamata
no Orochi</span></i> must have ordered the Follower to come here and retrieve
it. I doubt that the girl, or any other Head, knew their liege Lord was but a
puppet in Rinne-kun’s hand.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Kagutsuchi heaved a long sigh. Sei no Tsurugi no Rinne, the
girl he used to address as Rin-chan in an intimate way, was once a
straightforward and honest person. What she was now, instead, was a dangerous
schemer and manipulator who moved the Dark God along with the Eight Followers
in the shadow the way a skillful chess player would his pawns. Kagutsuchi shook
his head in sheer exasperation. How did it all come to this? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Oh well, what can I do?” He sighed one last time before he
walked toward the Dimensional Portal that was the exit of the Memories Hall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Wait a minute, Kagutsuchi-san,” Susanou called. When Kagutsuchi
turned to look at his twin brother, the man had risen from the chair and was
now standing and looking at Kagutsuchi with an agonized expression on his face.
Kagutsuchi could only wonder why. “I paid a visit to Yui-nee-san earlier today,
in the Tower of the Sun in the Heavenly Palace,” the shorter man said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Did something happen to her?” he asked, feeling fear
wrapping its claws around his heart. Susanou’s voice was tight, which suggested
that what the God of Storms was about to announce wasn’t going to be pleasant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“We were talking in her guest chamber when she suddenly had a
seizure,” replied Kagutsuchi’s twin brother, his voice on the verge of being
shattered to pieces. “There was nothing I could do to ease her suffering, and
you were away from Heaven then, so I had no one to call for help. I was so
afraid I was going to lose her the way she thrashed in pain so.” Susanou’s
face, normally as cold and emotionless as a winter stone, was twisted by
unspeakable grief and horror. The sight of the Goddess of the Sun being
tortured physically and mentally must have completely unnerved him, Kagutsuchi
knew. Had he been there himself, he would have reacted the same way. They both
loved their gentle and cheerful onee-chan so....</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

shook them almost violently. “Is Yui-nee okay? Is she?! Tell me, Susanou!”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“She should be fine now. The seizure stopped after a few
minutes.” Susanou’s hand rose to clutch at his forehead. “I brought her to bed
and stayed there with her until she fell asleep.”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Why did you leave her side, Susanou?!” Kagutsuchi demanded
in a strained but heated voice. “For Heaven’s sake, she might just suffer from
another seizure without anyone nearby! How thoughtless can you be?!”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“How?” Susanou snapped angrily. “As soon as I was done
sending a message to Reiha through the secure channel, the system warned me
that the Orochi girl was breaking into the Memories Hall. I had to go into the
Kannazuki Towers and waited there until she left. Had I not <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>promised</span></i> Rinne-kun
seventeen years ago that I would give her what she wanted, I would have <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>killed</span></i> that kid the moment
she entered and gone back to check up on Yui-nee-san.”</p>

text-indent:.5in'>“I... I... see. I’m sorry, Susanou,” Kagutsuchi murmured
apologetically as he slowly removed his hands from his brother’s shoulders in
the end. The God of Storms gave a dismissive wave of his hand, which could
either mean the acceptance of Kagutsuchi’s apology or that there was nothing to
forgive.</p>

not. The Lady is both worried and angry, you see, Kagutsuchi-san.”</p>

smile faltered, however, the moment he was reminded of how terrible the...
disease that was plaguing his beloved onee-chan was. “Do you think the Lady can
save Yui-nee, Susanou?” The face of the God of Storms grew mournful almost
instantly.</p>

along every fiber of his existence. “She doesn’t have long to live, and she may
have to watch her dream coming with her to the grave, unfulfilled. Yet... yet
why does she still have to suffer every single day? <i><span style='font-family:

Hall, his head instinctively turned toward the Heavenly Palace, the immense
structure standing at the heart of Izumo. He started to grit his teeth in
anger. The Lord Izanagi, his Father, seemed to have a strange and inexplicable
fondness for bullying his children. He imprisoned Akira for the last three
thousand year, he chained the Goddess of the Moon in perpetual sorrow, and he
watched in glee while Yui-nee’s life became worse than death. <i><span

may leave, Otoha-san,” Himemiya Chikane said, back leaning against the headboard
of her bed, hands folded on her lap, her eyes gazing at the distance beyond her
open window. “I shall call when I need assistance.” She doubted that she ever
would. Unlike earlier this morning, Chikane now had regained enough strength to
move around and did virtually anything she wished. She suspected that her
speedy recovery had more to do with her Priestess powers rather than with the
medicine Katou-sensei had prescribed, however.</p>

being elsewhere, Chikane only noticed that the young woman had already departed
when she heard the door opened and then closed quietly on the other side of the
room. Her sapphire eyes fell upon the tray of food that Otoha had left behind,
atop the table by Chikane’s bed. Hunger was clawing at her stomach, since she
had not eaten anything ever since last night, but the last thing she wanted to
do right now was to touch the food. For some reason, she was certain that the
moment her lips closed around the smallest bit would also be the moment she
spat it out.</p>

outside of the window. It was indeed a beautiful day. The sun was shining
amidst the deep azure heavens, the air cool, and the birds inhabiting the
Himemiya Garden singing together in a melody that could have moved anybody
else’s heart. Anyone else. For Chikane, the scenery only drowned her deeper
into the sea of hopelessness and despair. After all, all it managed to do was
reminding her of the day Chikane first met her one and only love, Kurusugawa

leaning against the strong plank of an ancient oak tree, sapphire eyes closed,
Himemiya Chikane found herself relaxing in the peaceful serenity that enveloped
her whole. This Garden of the Roses, fenced and carefully concealed, was a
place the existence of which was known to none except her and her Father. It
was her modest kingdom. It was her safe haven, where she was guarded against
the rest of world. It was the little corner her father the Ototachibana Academy
headmaster had built for her, at her request. He had laughed when Chikane told
him she wanted a place where she would not be disturbed, but he granted her
wish all the same.</span></i></p>

settled down upon the smooth, grassy ground, quietly indulging herself in the
cool shade that the ancient tree cast, silently taking in the faint fragrance
of the roses on the fences. The Garden of the Roses was easily her favorite
spot in the vast Ototachibana Academy, for only here could she find peace of
mind. Out there, wherever she went, students stared at her in what seemed to be
a blend of awe and desire. They knew she was the only daughter of the master of
this school, the future heiress to Himemiya Empire, so they flocked to her like
birds of prey, hoping to share the glory she possessed. She was disgusted by
the fact that she had to face such people, sickened by the fact that she had to
smile in front of them even when distaste soured her stomach.</span></i></p>

to pay.</span></i></p>

Chikane stood up and moved nearer to see. Then out of the bush came someone,
who tripped on the ground and crashed into her. As a result, both of them lost
balance and fell onto the ground. Stars erupted in her vision the moment her
back slammed upon the ground. Once Chikane had recovered from the pain, she
lifted her head, meaning to have a sharp word with whoever it was that dared
trespassed into her sanctuary. Words died in her throat, however, when she
looked at the person whose body was lying atop her own, the one who was staring

girl of Chikane’s age, whose golden hair was tied into two long braids that
hang on her slender shoulders. The color of her eyes was that of amethyst,
which Chikane had not seen on anyone else during her entire life. These rare
crystals were so bright, clear, and at the same time so deep Chikane could
drown herself in them forever. Having a complexion that was snow-white, a
little nose that looked just right, smooth cheeks that seemed to invite kisses,
lips that were small and delicate as a cherry blossoms petal, and a body that
was tender, fragile, and light, the golden-haired person who had just intruded

air Chikane breathed. Before she knew what she was doing, her left arm had
already fastened around the girls slim waist, her right rising just so she
could place a hand upon the left cheek of the stunning beauty. What Chikane did
was a far cry from appropriate, that she knew better than anyone, but for some
reason... letting go of the golden-haired girl was the last thing she ever
wanted. Her hand, originally on the intruders soft cheek, then moved to the
back of her head. Chikane’s breath caught the moment she realized that she was
trying to shrink the distance between their faces, their lips. Horrified, she
took her hand away... at the exact same moment the other girls lovely mouth
issued a disappointed sigh. </span></i></p>

reluctantly untied her arms around Chikane’s back. That did not help, really,

found what she wished for most. Since birth, her life had been nothing but
abundant, where every of her desires were made reality. Yet, deep down, she

glowing around their fingers, pulsing bright red. It disappeared the instant

living in boredom until death came to take her away. Had it not been for it,

The golden-haired angel was unlike anyone Chikane ever met. She was kind,
honest, and she truly cared about her friends. Best of all, she never got
worked up about social standings. Even when she learned who Chikane was, Himeko
still treated her with the same way she did before. The golden-haired girl was
only concerned whether Chikane wanted her for a friend, not her wealth, or her
status, she had confessed. Chikane never doubted for once second that it was
the truth.</p>

Chikane started to do everything she could to be with her. She never minded
staying in school after class to spend some time alone with the little angel,
to take her somewhere she liked or to play the piano for her. She never minded
waking up at two or three in the morning, either, to learn to make a lunchbox
so that she could share with her new found love at break time. How she had
shocked the Head Maid Kisaragi Otoha then, when the young woman went into the
kitchen and saw that everything was a mess. She was by no means skilled at
cooking, still, so the food she prepared ended up either burned or badly
flavored. Yet, Himeko ate every bit. The content and happy expression on the
girl’s face had had Chikane glow in joy for the rest of the day.</p>

Chikane noticed that her cheeks were soaked with tears. She was crying. She

hard to make sure no sound would come. She had forgotten that that blood tasted
this bitter.</p>

on the chair in front of his desk in the Temple of the Dragons, Girochi Tokiya
gazed at the mirror of water he had wrought with Suikyou’s power, one that
delved into the consciousness and memory of the girl it showed. The Priestess
of the Moon was agonizing, a fact an Orochi like himself should be gloating
over. Yet, his heart felt as heavy as a good chunk of rocks. Was he...
sympathizing toward her? Tokiya shook his head as hard as he could. That was
pure idiocy. Himemiya Chikane was their archenemy, who had to be killed to
ensure the safety of the Followers as a whole. He could not <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>afford</span></i> feeling sorry for
her now could he?</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Having fun watching the Priestess, Tokiya?” the deep, sultry
voice of his Aneki Miyako said from behind his back. Upon turning his head to
look, Tokiya saw that the darkly tanned young woman was standing by the open
door to his room, a little knowing smile adorning her lips. Behind her
rectangular spectacles, her eyes were gleaming with speculations. His sister
was <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>scheming</span></i>
something, he knew it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Since when did you arrive, Aneki?” Tokiya undid the vision
spell with a snap of his fingers.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Since the Priestess began to reminisce her happy days, I
think.” Miyako gave her lips a thoughtful tap. “By the way, Tokiya, do remember
to close the door to your room, would you? I have a feeling that when you’re
not holding a sword, you’re even more defenseless than a child,” teased the
Second Head of the Orochi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

him... but sometimes he did wish she would find it in herself to respect his
privacy.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

Followers laughed quietly. “Who could have thought that Himemiya Chikane was <i><span

think seriously I would let such a good opportunity pass by without taking
advantage of it?”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You do not need me to remind you that the Lord forbids all
harmful measures toward the Priestesses, do you?” His tone made certain that
whatever his sole living family member was scheming in her head, he was going
to neither approve of nor want to take part in it. He was an obedient servant of
the Lord, and as such, he surely would not do anything that risked the
displeasure of the God he worshipped. Besides, he did not wish to harm the
Priestess of the Moon....</p>

not.” Miyako smiled coolly but decidedly menacingly. His beloved sister the
Second Head might be, Tokiya could not deny the fact that she was an utterly
dangerous woman. She was one person in this whole wide world aside from the
Dark God that Tokiya would never want to cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Driving a wedge between the Priestesses,” announced Girochi
Miyako, her voice brimming with excitement and glee. “I’m surprised at how much
the Lord babied them while he should be commanding us to destroy them. I don’t
care if the Lord thinks he’s strong enough to defeat Ame no Murakumo this time,
what he’s doing is way too dangerous.” The displeased look on her face mirrored
the emotion in her words. “I’m not going to sit in one place and watch the
threat grow, Tokiya.” His elder sister glanced at him, her face softening. “I
will do anything to ensure the safety of both of us, little brother, you must
understand that.”</p>

was one more person that his elder sister had elected to not mention. Tokiya
all but wondered if the young woman was aware of how he felt toward

idea in his head, before he opened his mouth and asked quietly, “Can you
promise me that you will do nothing that would go against the order of the
Lord, Aneki?” His request was met with a slightly irritated look.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Didn’t I say that all I wanted to do was drive a wedge
between them?” When the Second Head realize that the firm expression on
Tokiya’s face meant that he was not going to participate in her plan unless she
promised, she sighed and said, “Fine, fine, you have my word.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Being siblings who had shared ups and downs all their lives,
he understood his elder sister more than anyone else in the world. The tanned
woman might have schemed to sow the seeds of discord in the Priestesses’
relationship originally, but Tokiya knew that she would kill Himemiya Chikane
or Kurusugawa Himeko, or both, if she believed that she could get away
unscathed. Tokiya was definitely not going to let her succumb to idiocy and
consequently receive severe punishment from the Dark God.</p>

exceptionally pleased. “Come to my room later when you’re ready. You’re going
to show me everything the Priestess of the Moon has been feeling in her heart
for the last month or so.” When she turned to leave, though, Tokiya put a hand
on her shoulder and halted her.</p>

I know, because I would not, either.</span></i> True, he was similar to the
Priestess in the way they both had surrendered their one true love because they
knew they could never win... yet if someone asked him the same question he had
asked his elder sister, he was surely going to laugh at that someone’s face. It
was hurtful enough trying to forget the woman he had come to love. Helping her
become happy with her lover was simply beyond his capabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Yet... it was not beyond Himemiya Chikane’s. That was what
had been puzzling him for a while now. Tokiya was a player who would toy with a
girl and left her to the mercy of the Gods once he devastated her life. He
flitted from one girl to another, hardly spending any time considering whether
what he did was right. His victims should be piling higher than Mount Fuji, and
he would only chuckle in pride whenever he remembered them. Why should he
bother himself over a bunch of girls who merely fell for his looks, who were
merely masses of lust and dark desires anyway? That was what he had always
thought. However, this one girl, the Moon Priestess, made him question his
belief. For the first time in his life, Tokiya saw someone who sacrificed her
feelings for her beloved’s sake. She was unimaginably foolish. She was
undoubtedly insane. Yet at the same time she was so disgustingly noble he began
to have some respect for someone he should not.</p>

you go, Chikane-chan,” Kurusugawa Himeko murmured as she laid the food tray she
had been carrying upon the table by her beloved princess’s bedside. On the wooden
receptacle sat a large bowl of thick porridge the content of which smelled so
good it could make any person’s mouth water whether that same person’s stomach
was full or not. Or so she would believe before she glanced at the girl she
loved.... Chikane-chan obviously thought otherwise. As soon as the Himemiya
Ojou-sama’s sapphire gaze fell upon the food tray, her expression grew sour and
her mouth twisted in distaste. She shivered, too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Why did <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>you</span></i>
of all people bring that here, Himeko?” inquired the princess, who was leaning
her back against the headboard. The blue-haired girl, in a nightgown different
from the one in which she had collapsed in the morning, looked infinitely
better than before. A healthy color had returned to her cheeks, the beautiful gleam
to her sapphire eyes, and strength to her slender body. Come tomorrow and no
one could have guessed that Chikane-chan had been struck down by a strange
sickness earlier today. </p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Because Otoha-san was desperate, Chikane-chan,” Himeko
answered with a smile that was part firm and part rueful as she settled herself
down on the bed, next to the light of her world. “She said that you had been
refusing to eat no matter what she brought in. Is that right?”</p>

text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“Please,
Kurusugawa-sama,”</span></i> Kisaragi Otoha-san had called Himeko’s name in a
surprisingly beseeching voice. The young woman with the curly hair had cornered
Himeko as soon as she stepped past the entrance to the Mansion of the Himemiya.
In the waning light of the setting sun, the Head Maid’s face was pale, her lips
bloodless, and her hands never stopped fidgeting with the front of her Himemiya
livery outfit. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“Help me
persuade Ojou-sama to eat something, I beg of you. She has not touched her food
since the morning!” </span></i>Despair all but filled her words.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Saying that the young woman was desperate was an
understatement, actually. Himeko didn’t have to pay much attention to her to
realize that Otoha-san was at her wit’s end. The fact that she was asking
Himeko, whom she without a doubt disliked with a passion, for help was the
proof that the Head Maid was on the verge of panic. Himeko could sympathize
with her. For someone whose entire life had been diligently devoted to serving
the blue-haired princess, there could be nothing more frightening that seeing
Chikane-chan disregard her own health and refuse to listen to other’s counsel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I wondered what had given Otoha-san the notion that you
could persuade me.” The princess gave her a cool look that was more playful
than serious.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Chikane-chan didn’t say anything in response to that. The
princess merely studied Himeko with a strange expression on her lovely face
until Himeko’s own began to flush under the full attention of the one she
loved. “Must you press me so, Himeko?” the blue-haired girl decided to speak up
in the end. “Everything tastes like dust in my mouth. Why bother making me eat
when I do not want to?” Her voice was serious, her face blank, and her eyes,
blue fire under the bed lamps on either side of her bed, were as distant as the
stars on high.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

exasperation taut in her voice. “Without something in your stomach, how will
you last the night?”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The Himemiya Ojou-sama heaved a long, defeated sigh. “Fine,
fine,” she muttered in resignation. “I will do as you wish.” While Himeko
smiled at her, the other girl shifted her body on the bed and reached for the
bowl of porridge near the bed lamp. As soon as her delicate hands touched the
thing, they recoiled as though gnawed by some wild animal. “Oww,” she muttered
with a rueful smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'>“Be careful, Chikane-chan,” Himeko said worriedly as she took
the princess’s hands into hers to examine. She heaved a sigh of relief when she
saw that although her sweetheart’s fingers were a little reddened from the
heat, there was no sign that they would require treatment. Leave them alone and
they would recover in no time, she believed. “You should have taken the tray
instead, you know,” she added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

her lap, took a spoonful of porridge out of it, gently breathed on the content
to take off some of the heat, and then put the spoon in front of her beloved’s
lovely mouth. “Say <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ah</span></i>,
Chikane-chan.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The princess’s blank expression never changed a hair even
when she gracefully tucked the hair on the sides of her face behind her ears,
even when she opened her mouth wide enough just for Himeko, and even when every
spoon fed to the girl she loved made Himeko’s heart beat a little bit faster,
her cheeks turn warmer, and her own lips become dryer. What would she not give
for a kiss? What would she not pay for an embrace? What would she not kill to
receive the princess’s love?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'>“Do you want seconds, Chikane-chan?” Himeko asked hopefully
once the bowl of porridge had been emptied. Her bubble burst instantly, of
course, when the princess simply gave a slight shake of her head, her face
betraying so little emotion she could have made a rock look cheerful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You have a little bit of porridge on your face,
Chikane-chan,” Himeko pointed out at the same time she picked up the napkin and
reached for the spot just below the princess’s underlip. She froze dead in her
track, however, the moment the blue-haired girl’s hand, utterly gentle but
quick as lightning, caught her by the wrist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I... can do it myself. Thank you, Himeko,” the other girl
murmured in a deathly quiet voice, her sapphire eyes locked with Himeko’s
amethyst in an intense gaze that seared deep into her soul. Still in shock, she
watched as the Himemiya Ojou-sama’s vacant hand removed the napkin and used it
to clean up the leftover porridge. Then she let go of Himeko’s hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>After that, the two of them looked at each other until the
silence made Himeko so uncomfortable she blurted out the first thing that
popped up in her mind, “Do you want me to call Oogami-sensei, Chikane-chan? I’m
sure he’ll understand it and postpone the Unseal Ritual scheduled for tomorrow
if I tell him that you are not feeling well.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Will you stop fussing over me, Himeko?” For the first time
since Himeko stepped inside the room, the princess laughed softly. “I am not so
weak I need to stay home another day just because of a little sickness.” Her
laughter held no mirth, her eyes remained chilling, and her face could have
been carved from eternal ice. She made Himeko want to run her hands up and down
her arms to warm herself up. Why was Himeko’s sweetheart acting so strangely
tonight?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

conclude the whole affair with her childhood friend as soon as possible. The
longer she let it continue, the more the boy would be hurt in the end. She

to Himeko before she closed the door and found herself standing in a daze in

head and made chills ran all the way through her body. <i><span

Kazuki had been through countless battles, most of them life-threatening, but
never before had he feel so insecure, so unsettled, and so <i><span

the Enshrinement Chamber of Shingetsu, where the Eyes of Heaven were kept safe,
countless times during the last twenty years but this was the first time he had
to consume every ounce of his strength in order to not quake in his boots. A
dozen feet away from him, at the center of the Chamber, on either side of the
column of eternal ice that encased the pair of weapons known as the True Keys
of Awakening, stood the Priestesses of the Sun and Moon, who were reciting the
incantations while being absolutely unaware of the menacing aura radiating from
the five remaining Shinken Swords.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Kazuki couldn’t help but tremble in fear. The Shinken were
guardians of Ame no Hitomi, the Eyes of Heaven. Despite the fact that they were
incapable of speech, they were still sentient beings charged with the duty of
removing all those who were foolish enough to think that they could claim the
Keys... or those who wished the Keys gone from the bottom of their hearts. As
soon as either of the two kinds came inside the Shinken’s sphere of influence,
the Swords would unleash their sacred lightning and annihilated the ones whom
they deemed dangerous. However, before the Shinken struck, they would first
give a warning by ringing out in a malicious melody and radiating a hateful
aura that was unmistakable to a Shingetsu High Priest. And the Shinken Seals
were doing exactly that <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>now</span></i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

Kazuki, confusion evident on their pretty faces. Yet, he was too late in
warning the Priestesses, as the Shinken Seals had already entered their
offensive phase. Ribbons of lightning, so white they made falling snow look
dark and so hot they made the sun seem cool, sprang forth from the five columns
of light in which the Shinken resided and rushed straight toward... Himemiya
Chikane, the Priestess of the Moon.</p>

the daughter of the Himemiya was no simple mortal. In less than a second, she
had succeeded in drawing enough energy from the Moon Crest on her back, which
glowed brighter than noonday, to construct a barrier of silver light around her
slender frame. The ribbons of white lightning that were the embodiment of the
Shinken Seals, as a result, could only ricochet off the smooth surface of the
barrier and wrought havoc upon the rocky walls, ceiling, and floor of the great
Chamber. One of the lightning bolts, however, would have sheared an arm off
Kurusugawa Himeko’s body had the girl not reacted quickly enough and thrown
herself out of the way.</p>

barrier could have done to the girl she loved, Himemiya Chikane immediately
dispelled her only means of defense. As soon as the silver light wreathing around
her melted like mist in the morning sun, a second wave of sacred lightning came
forward from the Shinken Swords and struck the daughter of the Himemiya dead
on. The girl screamed out in utmost agony before she fell on her stomach upon
the Chamber floor, her body engulfed in fuming smoke.</p>

the fabric of her Priestess outfit. Eventually, the smoke faded away.
“Himemiya-san!” Pressing his fingers against the underside of her wrist, Kazuki
heaved a sigh of relief the moment he realized that her heart was still beating.
He guessed that perhaps her inner powers had protected her against the sacred
lightning of the Shinken. Else, the girl would have been rendered to dust.</p>

his arms. Goosebumps rose all over his skin, daggers of ice staking his heart. <i><span

thought in horror.</p>

attacked you.... It was because you wanted to protect me that you were hurt....
I’m sorry, Chikane-chan....” Tears flowed down her face in streams and dripped
onto the other girl’s cheeks. “I’m sorry....”</p>

healing spell, Himemiya Chikane opened her eyes. Weakly, slowly, but steadily,
the hand of the blue-haired girl rose upward and placed itself upon the other

okay.”</p>

into fist. Himeko was mistaken when she said she had screwed up the ritual. As
far as Kazuki could tell, there was absolutely nothing wrong with the way the
Priestess of the Sun recited the ancients words that were supposed to disarm
the Shinken Swords. No there wasn’t. The Seals must have viewed the Priestess
of the Moon as dangerous. That should be the sole reason why they assaulted <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>her</span></i> instead of the other
two people inside this chamber. Chills slithered down his spine. Himemiya
Chikane had to be harboring some sort of dark thoughts toward the objects the

by the open window of her room, arms folded beneath her chest, eyes gazing into
the darkness of night, Himemiya Chikane was deeply disturbed. Despite being
struck by the sacred lightning of the Shinken less than twelve hours ago, there
was not even a burnt mark on her body. Sadly enough, the Shinken had done
something much worse than that. Instead of hurting her physically, they
tormented her mind. Whenever she went down to that wretched Enshrinement
Chamber, a lava-hot and tornado-strong emotion she could only name hatred would
rise in her soul and overwhelmed her completely. Whenever she looked at the
throbbing golden sphere trapped in the middle of that eternal ice pillar, her
eyes burned with madness, her heart convulsed in disgust, and her blood went
boiling with murderous intent. She but wondered why she despised the Shinken,
the Eyes of Heaven, and Ame no Murakumo so much.</p>

loved.</p>

the golden-haired girl, listening to her talking on the phone with Oogami

Chikane’s heart started to pound. “She looks fine, I know, but I don’t think
she’s feeling well after all that happened over your house earlier. I... I...
only want to take care of her. It was my fault she was hurt.” The girl’s voice
trembled. “During all the time we were together, she always cared for me,
protected me, and did her best to make me happy. But... but... all I ever gave
her in return was trouble. I can’t keep doing that, Sou-chan. I owe her
everything I have, including my own life. I’m sorry I have to break the promise

coast. The experts predicted that they might even experience high waves coming
from the sea, which would certainly wreak terrible havoc along the coastline
and terribly affect Mahoroba City itself. It was indeed a good thing that

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

nothing to lighten Himeko’s mood.</p>

shape of the Moon Crest emerged beneath the other girl’s feet. All at once, the
sounds of the rain plummeting upon the roof of the Himemiya Mansion, the winds
howling across the earth, and the lightning tearing the night apart died down
as though someone had found the Mute button of the world and pushed it. Her
clothes stirring slightly although there wasn’t a gentlest breeze, Himeko’s one
and only love raised her right hand and brought it down from left to right in a
fast, decisive stroke. High in the heavens shrouded by darkness, the clouds
parted in a clean cut as though slashed by a knife. Every additional stroke of
Chikane’s hand continued to sever the cloud-ridden sky until all the paths she
had cleared formed a gigantic pentacle inscribed within a circle. Then the
symbol set itself ablaze in a blinding flash silver light and a deafening roar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>When the light faded away, neither a tiniest bit of cloud nor
a drop of water remained in Himeko’s field of view. The sun was there once more
amid the cerulean sky, washing its golden shines upon the verdant field that
was the Himemiya’s endless garden. The storm might have never existed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'>Another time, Himeko would have been amazed at the miracle
Chikane-chan just performed. Another time, she would have opened her eyes wide
in wonder and unleashed her onslaught of questions upon the one she loved.
However, with the departure of this one storm, another raged on in her soul, a
blizzard that would freeze hell over. Himeko gathered her arms around her body,
trying to keep herself still. Moisture started to grow in her eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

tenderly at her.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>“You wish to see me go no matter what, Chikane-chan?” Himeko
heard her voice breaking like stepped-on glass. She made no effort to hide it.
She didn’t have the strength to, anyhow. “What have I done to make you dislike
me so?” Tears leaked from the corners of her eyes and rolled down her cheeks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

appearing terribly confused. “How can I dislike you? I... I....” She stopped
abruptly.</p>

face in her hands and sobbed. “I said I wanted to take care of you. I only
wanted to make you happy. Why won’t you let me? Why do you keep pushing me
away?”</p>

pending up inside her heart now broke free from the restraints with which she
had imprisoned them and swallowed her whole. She had wished that Chikane-chan
would somehow come to see her as more than a friend. She had hoped that a day
would come where her blue-haired princess would take her hand and tell her that
she loved her. She was now no longer sure she should persevere and wait until
her dream was made reality. And it <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>wasn’t</span></i>
going to be, seeing how Chikane-chan had been trying her hardest to bring
Himeko and her childhood friend together, how the princess never showed the
slightest hint of jealousy, and how the blue-haired girl refused to let Himeko
learn what lay in her heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

I brought you more trouble with every blunder I made, but... but...” Himeko
continued in her tearful, trembling voice, “I just don’t want you to hate me,
Chikane-chan.”</p>

body shaking the way a thin tree would against a strong gust of wind. On the
next, she found herself in the gentle embrace of the one she dearly loved.
Chikane-chan’s arms were around Himeko’s shoulders, the former’s hand combing
through her golden tresses. Still overwhelmed by grief, Himeko pounded her tiny
hand upon the princess’s own shoulder and wept harder than ever. The Himemiya
Ojou-sama let her do as she wished. The blue-haired girl merely held Himeko
close and brushed her hair in silence.</p>

after a while. “Hate you? How am I supposed to do that? You are closer than any
sister my parents could have given. You are more precious to me than any other
person in this world. If only... if only I could show you how much I like you.
Have you any idea why I brought you here, why I tried so hard to free the Eyes
of Heaven with you?”</p>

text-indent:.5in'>“Because... you want to save the people?” Himeko mumbled, her
mind going numb. In the princess’s arms, the storm of emotions in Himeko
finally abated. With the blue-haired girl’s arms wrapped around her so gently,
with her body heat invading every fiber of Himeko’s existence, she thought she
was going to melt. Her heart, aching in pain just a few moments ago, now
pounded madly when she began to hear what the other girl had just told her. <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Closer than any sister. More precious
than any person in this world,</span></i> those words rang in her mind in a heart-warming
melody. Did Chikane-chan just say what Himeko thought she said?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

her cheek brushing against that of Himeko. “Whatever happens to them is none of
my concern. The one whom I care for, whom I want to protect, whose smile I wish
to behold, is <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>you</span></i>,
Himeko.” She placed a hand upon Himeko’s cheek and caressed it almost lovingly.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Who else?” Chikane-chan gave her a little melancholic smile.
“You are the person I would gladly trade my life for, have I not told you so
already? Had it been possible, I would have hogged you all to myself. Had it
been okay, I would have never let you out of my sight for one split second. Can
you imagine how much it hurt me to see that with the arrival of Oogami Souma, I
am no longer your number one? Do you know how much it pained me to realize that
you were drifting further and further away from me while I could do nothing to
stop it?” The princess sighed. “Still, it is a fact I have to accept. It is
inevitable. You do not belong to me. I have no right to become the obstacle
standing in your way to happiness. So I let go of you. I do not hate you,
Himeko. I just wish you to spend more time by the side of the one you love.
Seeing you happy is all I ever want, you must know that.”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I am sorry, Himeko. Did I say something bad?” Chikane-chan
said as she hastily pulled a handkerchief out of her pocket and used it to dab
at Himeko’s face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“No, it’s not your fault, Chikane-chan,” Himeko managed
between the sobs that the princess had successfully renewed for her. “I’m
just... I’m just glad I got the answer I’ve been looking for. I’m sorry I
misunderstood you, Chikane-chan.” She fastened her arms around the other girl’s
soft, fragrant body and wept openly into her full bosom.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

dried the last tear off Himeko’s face. “Oogami-san will think terrible of me if
he sees you in such condition.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>It finally made sense to her. Himeko was right when she
started suspecting that Chikane-chan was in love with her all along. The reason
why the princess never showed her a sign of jealousy, why she never made any
attempt to confess, and why she appeared to be shunning Himeko were because she
thought Himeko was in love with her childhood friend. The blue-haired girl did
her best to bring Himeko and Sou-chan together not because she wanted to, but
because she wished for Himeko’s happiness. Himeko’s sweetheart had been
suppressing her emotion all along for her sake. She noticed that Chikane-chan
never said that she loved her right out... but it couldn’t be more obvious now
could it?</p>

Chikane-chan,</span></i> Himeko thought as she put her arms around the
princess’s neck, rose on her toes, and attempted to claim the lips of the
blue-haired girl. She froze dead, however, the moment someone knocked on the
door to her room.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>At first, Himeko thought that she was going to let her
childhood friend wait down there and proceed to confess her love to the
blue-haired princess. A second later, she decided that it would be a bad idea
to do so. It would take quite a bit of time to explain to Chikane-chan that all
there was nothing romantic going on between her and the boy Oogami Souma, that
she was the only one Himeko ever loved. And once she had revealed her feelings
to the Himemiya Ojou-sama, there was no guarantee that she could break away and
still go with Sou-chan afterwards. Besides, it would be best to clear the
misunderstanding between her and the boy first. Now that Himeko had learned how
the princess felt toward her, time to spend by each other’s side was the one
thing they did not lack.</p>

Chikane-chan.”</p>

her sweetheart’s cheek before she let go of her and hurried out of her room.
Chikane-chan would keep the promise. The princess would wait for Himeko. The
girl she loved would listen to her confession then. If the Gods were willing,
they might share their first kiss tonight. If all went well, Chikane-chan might
become much more than Himeko’s best friend before the dawn of a new day, the
dawn of their new world.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>Sitting
upon a branch of one of the oak trees near little Chikane’s window, her body
shielded from the naked eyes, Yui the Goddess of the Sun silently watched as
the blue-haired girl’s slender frame disintegrated into a million sparks of
silver stars and fused into the light of the morning. Yui but wondered where
the girl went.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Did you see what she did with the storm, Yue?” Yui asked the
silver-haired girl sitting one branch below hers. The Goddess of the Moon, in
her heavenly robe the color of which was as white as driven snow, appeared
someone who had just been saved from drowning in the sea. Her face, normally
cold as ice and hard as iron, now was but aglow with excitement, joy, and
relief. She had never seemed more beautiful in the last three thousand years
Yui had spent by her side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Yes,” answered the Goddess of the Moon with a cool voice and
a face that made her voice seem warm and affable. Happy enough to be jumping up
and down inside or not, she was surely not going to show Yui an ounce of
friendliness. “Since her collapse yesterday, she had regained at least half of
her powers. Now she is the equal to any Orochi Follower, including the kid with
Hokuto the Star Blade.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>How</span></i>
is it a good thing?” Yue very nearly snapped. “Her powers are the chains that
keep <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>it</span></i> locked
inside Chikane’s heart. The fact that they are coming back to her only means
that the binding is being weakened.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Pretending to be unaware of the heat in the other girl’s
voice, Yue replied nonchalantly, “So what? It isn’t as if all of the chains
have been broken. Give the child some credit, will you? Chikane’s willpower is
strong, that you know better than anyone does. Else, she couldn’t have held
back the mechanism until this point.”</p>

sniffed derisively. Yui elected not to hear that, either. “True, she has
suffered much,’ she continued as though uninterrupted, “but her suffering will
end tonight, when little Himeko comes back and delivers her out of the hell in
which she has confined her heart. There will no longer be any problem then, is
there?” The face of the Goddess of the Moon softened, her lips curving upward
in a gentle smile. Her foul mood might never have existed. Yui sighed. Only the
Priestesses could have done something as miraculous as turning their foster
mother from a woman carved from ice into one made of flesh and blood. Yui <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>wished</span></i> she could do that
sometimes.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>“Perhaps you are right,” murmured the silver-haired girl in a
soft voice that was almost impossible to be heard. Well, it was somewhat of an
improvement, in any case. The Goddess of the Moon could have fired off some
scathing comment at Yui instead of saying something that sounded almost demure
and sweet. Yui but wondered if there was any other woman in all of the Three
Worlds who was as hard to please as the girl that was sitting so close to her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>It was odd, in any event. Normally one would expect one
person to at least vaguely take after her parents. Yue... never did. Her
mother, the Supreme Ruler of the Underworld, Izanami-sama, was heavens and
earth different from the Goddess of the Moon the way the former was vibrant,
kind to almost everybody she met, and had a warm personality. Sometimes Yui
could not believe how it was that a daughter could be so different from one
another.... She froze at the end of the thought and started to chuckle quietly
to herself. She was in no position to say that, actually, the way she and her
father, Izanagi-sama, was one another’s opposite. In any case, it would have
made a lot more sense had Yue been the daughter of the male Maker of the World
and Yui, the female one.</p>

the Goddess of the Moon darkened almost immediately. “Not since three thousand
years ago,” came the heated answer. Strangely, though, the silver-haired girl
voice was tinted with sadness.</p>

she muttered. “She gave birth to me. She granted me enough power to be able to
live on without being looked down by others. Yet... yet betrayal was all I
repaid her with. I am much worse than a mortal... or even an animal.” Her voice
cracked. The girl seemed on the verge of tears.</p>

word <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“betrayal”</span></i>.
Three millennia back in the shadow of the past, a terrible event named the
Great Conflict by the historians broke out between the Ruler of Heaven and the
Ruler of the Underworld, both happened to be residing in the Heavenly Palace of
Izumo then. No one was ever aware of the cause except Izanami-sama and
Izanagi-sama. All that the people of the Holy City knew was that the two Makers
got into some huge argument, which ended up infuriated Izanami-sama so terribly
she decided to sever all diplomatic ties with Izumo and take her daughter,
Tsukiyomi the Goddess of the Moon, back to her birthplace, Reiha of the
Underworld.</p>

safe haven that is her room in the Tower of the Sun, where she cried herself to
sleep. In such a pathetic state, she lost the power to govern the Sun, which
went horribly wrong as a result. The golden star went cold, thus depriving the
citizens of the Three Worlds of the light and the warmth without which they
could not survive. Worse, as soon as Yue left Heaven, the moon stopped shining,
for the Sealing Field encompassing Reiha disrupted the connection between the
silver star and its governess, the Goddess of the Moon. Without both the sun
and moon, no light came to the Human World. Monsters and demons were born from
the depth of night with a terrifying rare, free to roam the earth, free to
devour its innocent dwellers.</p>

would regain enough power to return the light of the sun to the world. He
failed. Regardless of the methods he employed in his attempt to bring Yui back
to duty, eternal snow storms covered the surface of the then ice-cold sun. The
end of the human world was but imminent. Frustrated, the man decided to deal
with the situation the rough way. Thinking that being the most powerful entity
in the Three Worlds would let him do whatever he wanted, Izanagi-sama ventured
into the Underworld all by himself, his true purpose unknown. He made a severe
miscalculation, in any case. Completely unaware of the existence of the Sealing
Field, created from a special breed of flowers called the Crystal Roses that
bloomed everywhere in the Underworld, the moment he arrived at Reiha was also
the moment his powers were all taken away. As a result, he was imprisoned in
the World of Souls... and would have stayed there for at least a few years
without the Goddess of the Moon’s intervention.</p>

prison cell a few days after he was captured, freed him and helped him get back
to the World of the Gods. Her heroic deeds did not go unnoticed. The Ruler of
Izumo, overwhelmed by his gratitude to the eighteen-year-old Goddess, adopted
her into his family and granted her the status of a High Immortal, a being who
was protected by the law. Yue had been staying in Heaven ever since she was
elevated to the highest echelon of the Gods.</p>

find out the truth when she was suddenly struck by a wave of dizziness. Fire
coursed in her veins, thunder roared in her head, and a storm of needles raged
upon every inch of her skin. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Not

tears rolled off his face and fell onto the floor. Each time a drop touched the
thick tatami layer, the whole room trembled as though the surface of a pond
disturbed by a rock. It was the same with the fake view of the white lily
fields out there, beyond the open shoji doors of his dimensional prison. It,
too, shook under his powers. Lately, there had been times when Akira regained
his consciousness and had an idea of what was happening around him. In those
short moments, he was hurt even more, for he was but aware that he had been
separated from the one he loved.</p>

contradicted her answer. “I... will see you around... Yue.” With a flicker of
her hand, golden light poured out of Yui’s body. Before they could envelop her
and transport her away, however, they snuffed out like a candle in the wind.
Then the woman’s eyes drew shut. The Goddess of the Sun lost her balance and
fell off the oak tree.</p>

screamed at the same time she unleashed her powers. A wave of silver light
emerged from her hand formed a large cloth around the golden-haired woman’s
body and caught her in its midst. When it was done lowering her gently onto the
ground, it disappeared.</p>

sweating within an inch of her life, whose skin was hot as the surface of any
oven, Yue let her right hand hover just an inch above the woman’s forehead and
gently eased her powers inside in an attempt of learning just exactly what was
wrong. Her eyebrows tried to shot off Yue’s scalp, however, when she realized
that Yui’s own powers were in great turmoil, and that they were causing huge
damage to the golden-haired woman’s internal organs. Yue stared at her in
utmost incredulity. So far, in the history of Heaven, there was not even one
Immortal who had fallen sick. What could be going on here?</p>

text-indent:.5in'>Trying to calm herself down, Yue placed the palm of her hand
upon Yui’s forehead and unleashed her healing power. Golden light blazed
fiercely as an invisible but incredible force hurled Yue’s hand away. Yue was
shocked. They were the Goddesses of the Sun and Moon, the manipulator of the
light of Heaven, known to possess an equal amount of strength. Yet, according
to what Yue sensed during the instant her powers collided with those of the
Goddess of the Sun, the latter’s strength far outstripped her. Worse, the
energy in the golden-haired Immortal’s was growing in such an alarming rate
that unless something was done, Yui was going to be burned to <i><span

Goddess of the Sun over and over again. Every single time, Yue’s hand would be
flung away by the invisible force. Every single time, Yue would apply a little
more strength and try to keep her hand still on the other woman’s forehead.
Silver light clashed with golden every second, Yue’s powers against Yui’s in a
fierce battle that she was not sure she could win. Except that she had to win,
no matter what the price she had to pay afterwards. <i><span style='font-family:

other as two drops of water, who grabbed Yue’s arms and pulled her away from
Yui’s body. Quicker than lightning, they took her to the sky, where Yue
suffered her second shock when she tried to break free from their grasp.
Although the girls were weaker than she was individually, their powers combined
were more than enough to render Yue useless.</p>

upon the ground, the clothes of the Goddess of the Sun began to catch fire. Bit

endless field where roses seemingly made out of crystal covered the earth. On
that same field, a woman in a white robe with long and wide sleeves and a hood
that cloaked her face was walking toward the Goddess of the Sun. With every
step she took, the roses in front of her parted to form a clear pathway and
came back to where they were after she had passed. Once she had gotten near
enough to Yui, the woman extended her right hand. Into her wide sleeve the
burning flames retreated, leaving an unconscious and badly burnt Yui alone.</p>
