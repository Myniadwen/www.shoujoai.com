<h1>Spiral of Destiny (part 15 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kannazuki/index.html">Kannazuki no Miko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nwarford.html">Nathan Warford</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kannazuki/kannanisou-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>The next few days were pleasantly uneventful for Himeko and Chikane. 
They slept until noon after they had returned from their journey. There 
were no classes to attend since the academy had been destroyed. It was 
the first time in 8 days that they had a chance to rest. However, they 
both wished that classes had been canceled under different 
circumstances. Despite the hardships that they had endured since 
Orochi&#39;s return on their 17th birthday, Himeko and Chikane enjoyed 
themselves as much as they could before the arrival of the next Orochi 
attack.

The rest of the day was spent recuperating from their strenuous, 5-day 
trek through the Japanese wilderness. Their legs ached and their 
stomachs growled after all of the exercise they had gotten and they were 
both thankful for the temporary intermission. The only time that Chikane 
spent on her feet was when she practiced her archery and the only time 
that Himeko spent on her feet was when she was helping Otoha cook sweet 
omelets.

Himeko and Otoha brought the sweet omelets to the yard where the archery 
course was situated. &quot;Miss,&quot; Otoha said as she and Himeko brought out 
the meal. &quot;The omelets are ready.&quot;

&quot;Thank you Otoha, Himeko,&quot; Chikane said, setting down her bow and 
arrows.

Otoha then turned to Himeko and said, &quot;And thank you for helping me in 
the kitchen, Miss Kurusugawa.&quot;

&quot;I was glad to help,&quot; Himeko said.

&quot;Would you like to join us?&quot; Chikane asked Otoha, taking the tray and 
sitting under the large tree in the yard.

&quot;Oh no,&quot; said Otoha. &quot;I&#39;m only a maid. It would be inappropriate for me 
to join the Mister and Missus&#39; guests for tea.&quot;

&quot;Otoha,&quot; said Chikane, &quot;it would mean a lot to me if you would join us. 
I know that you&#39;ve remembered who I am and that you&#39;ve remembered the 
ten years that we&#39;ve spent living under the same roof. You might have 
seen yourself as only a maid, but I&#39;ve always thought of you as much 
more. Even though you and I never talked very much, you have been one of 
the few friends I&#39;ve ever had.&quot;

&quot;Miss Chikane...&quot; said Otoha, tears coming to her eyes. &quot;Thank you, Miss 
Chikane!&quot; she cried, bowing to the black-haired girl. She then rose and 
smiled at Chikane. &quot;I&#39;m very happy that you think of me in such high 
regard. But I&#39;ve seen how you and...Himeko...act around each other. And 
if I interfere with your happiness, then that means that I have not 
performed my duty as the friend you think of me as.&quot;

&quot;Otoha?&quot; said the blond-haired girl. &quot;Did you just call me, &#39;Himeko&#39;?&quot;

Otoha, while not very hastily, still put her hand to her mouth. &quot;I 
suppose I did,&quot; the maid replied. &quot;I suppose that after all that&#39;s 
happened, after realizing that a more intimate relationship with Chikane 
wasn&#39;t meant to be, I knew that pursuing such a relationship would 
result in failure. So, I&#39;ve decided to save myself the effort of getting 
in the way of the happy relationship that you share with her. And now 
that I&#39;ve gotten over my jealousy, I&#39;ve actually begun to think of you 
as a friend.&quot; Otoha then took Himeko&#39;s hands in hers and said, &quot;Himeko, 
please. Will you accept me as your friend?&quot;

Both Himeko and Chikane were astounded by Otoha&#39;s sudden desire to 
become Himeko&#39;s friend. For several long moments, all that Himeko could 
do was stare at Otoha, who was looking back at Himeko, patiently 
awaiting an answer. Finally, after comprehending what Otoha had said, 
Himeko smiled and said. &quot;Otoha, I know that you and I have hardly ever 
seen eye-to-eye. But despite that, you still had the courage to ask for 
my friendship, even after the hard feelings that you&#39;ve felt toward me. 
I&#39;m honored that you have grown to think of me as a friend. And I would 
be happy to think of you as a friend too.&quot;

A large smile appeared on Otoha&#39;s face and she leapt toward Himeko, 
wrapping her arms around the shorter girl. &quot;Thank you, Himeko!&quot; she 
cried. Himeko was again surprised by how friendly Otoha was being with 
her. However, she accepted the friendship that Otoha was giving her and 
held Otoha as well. The scene was so moving that Chikane could not help 
but shed a tear.

It was at least a minute before Himeko and Otoha parted. &quot;Thank you for 
being my friend, Himeko,&quot; Otoha said.

&quot;Thank you for being mine,&quot; Himeko responded with a smile.

&quot;You two enjoy your sweet omelet together.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure you won&#39;t join us, Otoha?&quot; asked Himeko.

&quot;I&#39;m sure. These past few days have been hard on you. I think you 
deserve some time alone to yourselves. I would be happy to talk with you 
sometime in the future, though. Perhaps after this whole thing with the 
evil god is resolved.&quot;

&quot;I look forward to that day, Otoha,&quot; said Himeko. Otoha, with a smile, 
returned inside the house.

With Otoha no longer in their presence, Himeko went and sat under the 
tree next to Chikane. &quot;Amazing...&quot; said Chikane. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen Otoha 
so act so informally before! You really do have so much kindness in your 
heart.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t me, Chikane,&quot; said Himeko. &quot;It was Otoha that was kind enough 
to offer her friendship. And I really enjoyed spending time with her 
making these omelets.&quot;

&quot;Since you worked hard to make them, shouldn&#39;t we work hard to eat 
them?&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot; The two girls started happily eating the sweet omelets and 
drinking tea while they chatted about their plans for the future and 
what would happen when the Orochi would be defeated.

As they ate, Otoha looked on from a 2nd-story window, happily thinking, 
&#39;I&#39;m happy for you, Chikane, Himeko. I&#39;ll keep looking for the person 
that is just for me. And when I find that person, I will experience the 
happiness that you feel when you&#39;re together.&#39; With a newfound hope 
about making a future with somebody, Otoha went back to her duties with 
a smile.

----------

As the days progressed, Chikane and Himeko started acting just like 
normal girls in love would. After their day of rest, they got back on 
their feet and actually started going out on dates. They went to the art 
museum like they had after they first met. However, it was the first 
time that they had been there as more than just friends. Looking at the 
paintings that were exhibited was their favorite activity when they 
visited the museum. There was one painting that was especially precious 
to them: a painting of two people under a tree, surrounded by roses. It 
reminded them of how they first met in the flower garden at school.

The next day, they went to the amusement park like Himeko had done with 
Souma on their first date the year before. Even though it was the kind 
of place that boys would be more likely to enjoy than girls would, they 
still had a great time. They held each other&#39;s hands on the thrill 
rides, held each other in the haunted house, ate rice and vegetables 
that they cooked at the grill, and enjoyed the view of the village on 
the Ferris wheel. Himeko took many pictures of herself and Chikane 
enjoying the day.

The next day, they decided on a more intimate, private date. They went 
to the stable to find that the Himemiya family&#39;s horse, Saint Just, was 
still there, just as Chikane had left him. After fitting the saddle onto 
Saint Just&#39;s back, Chikane hopped up onto the horse. After Chikane had 
helped her up, Himeko sat sidesaddle in front of Chikane. They went 
horseback riding for most of the day, riding through the hills, enjoying 
the wind in their faces and the colors of the autumn leaves. They even 
stopped by the beach where Chikane had told Himeko about the shell 
matching game. Sitting on the beach made them so happy as they thought 
about the two halves of the pink seashell that they wore around their 
necks. Just like the halves of the shell, Himeko and Chikane were each 
other&#39;s other half.

By the end of the week, Himeko&#39;s photo album had been refilled with 
pictures that she had taken of her time spent with Chikane. That night, 
Chikane put on a long, black dress, lit candles by the piano, and played 
for Himeko, who became lost in the beautiful notes that the black-haired 
girl played. Even though it had been a year since Chikane had played the 
piano, she remembered her repertoire quickly, including the soothing, 
melodic song that Chikane used to play all the time. It could have been 
considered Chikane&#39;s theme and simply hearing the beautiful song being 
played made it clear that Chikane Himemiya existed in that world.

After Chikane played the piano for Himeko and the rest of the household 
had gone to bed, Chikane got a fire going in the fireplace. Chikane took 
Himeko to the nearby sofa and sat down at the end of the sofa, allowing 
Himeko to lie down and put her head in the taller girl&#39;s lap. The warm 
fire, the softness of Chikane&#39;s lap, and two delicate hands stroking her 
hair made Himeko so relaxed. &quot;I want to spend every day like this,&quot; 
Himeko said, closing her eyes.

&quot;So do I, Himeko,&quot; said Chikane.

&quot;Chikane, what do you think life will be like after we&#39;ve defeated the 
Orochi?&quot;

&quot;At the moment, the Orochi is the only thing keeping us from living 
normal lives. I suspect that once the fighting is over, we&#39;ll be free to 
love each other for the rest of our lives. We&#39;ll enjoy everything that a 
life free from the Orochi has to offer.&quot;

&quot;Like what?&quot;

Chikane smiled as she considered the possibilities. &quot;In the springtime, 
let&#39;s walk hand-in-hand down the lane lined with cherry blossom trees, 
wearing spring-colored jackets and hats of matching color. I&#39;ll be so 
happy if you could select them for us. Of course, please include your 
omelet in our lunchbox. Touching your hair as it glides in the spring 
breeze. I want to decorate you with hair ornaments made of cherry 
blossom-colored petals. In the summertime, hunting for fireflies would 
be good. Wearing matching yukatas and leather-soled sandals. Let me help 
you with putting on the yukata. The gentle sound of the mountain stream. 
The sound of the autumn insects that can&#39;t wait for autumn to arrive. 
The clear sound of Himeko laughing as you chase after the fireflies. It 
will create a beautiful harmony. In the autumn, we&#39;ll go for long rides. 
We&#39;ll ride together on Saint Just across the vast, brilliantly red 
colored land, feeling your warmth on my back. I want to keep on going 
forever. In the winter, let&#39;s hop on a train and go and see the ocean in 
an old train compartment where no one else rides, listening to the sound 
of a distant tide. I&#39;d like to doze off slowly, listening to the lullaby 
of the sweet sound of you sleeping.&quot;

&quot;That sounds wonderful...Chikane.&quot; Before they knew it, Himeko was 
sleeping peacefully in Chikane&#39;s arms and Chikane was sleeping just as 
soundly.

----------

As they slept, the two priestesses were blissfully unaware of the danger 
lurking no more than 10 meters below them. Below the house was a chamber 
with a large, vermillion torii with a rectangular tablet in between the 
supports with the kanji for the word &quot;master&quot; printed on it. Standing 
below the torii was Takeshi Himemiya, staring up at the large structure. 
His brown eyes turned amber and he disappeared in a flash of dark 
energy.

When Takeshi reappeared, it was upon the circular platform in the center 
of the Orochi realm. &quot;He&#39;s back,&quot; said Korona upon seeing the man 
standing amongst them.

&quot;The priestesses have let their guard down,&quot; Takeshi announced. &quot;You 
will not have a better time to begin.&quot;

&quot;Please, give us some time,&quot; cried Miyako. &quot;We&#39;re working as hard as we 
can to learn to summon Gattai Orochi.&quot;

&quot;If you cannot find it in you to summon it, it means that someone is 
holding back.&quot;

Suddenly, all eyes were on Souma. &quot;Me?&quot; Souma said incredulously. &quot;Why 
would I be holding back?&quot;

&quot;Because of your love for the Solar Priestess,&quot; Takeshi answered. Souma 
shook his head, denying Takeshi&#39;s explanation. &quot;I told you,&quot; said 
Takeshi, moving toward Souma, &quot;I can sense the feelings of the Orochi.&quot; 
Souma backed away as the man approached him. &quot;Even if you are not aware 
of those feelings on a conscious level, I can tell that they are there.&quot; 
Before Souma knew it, he was standing at the edge of the number seven 
torii with nowhere else to back away to. &quot;She has betrayed you, Souma,&quot; 
Takeshi said, now directly in front of the frightened teenager. &quot;No 
matter what happens, your feelings will never reach her.&quot;

&quot;Th-then,&quot; Souma stammered, &quot;w-what can I do?&quot;

&quot;Just tell yourself, &#39;If I can&#39;t have the Solar Priestess, no one will.&#39; 
Keep telling yourself that until you are able to let go.&quot;

&quot;&#39;If I can&#39;t have the Solar Priestess, no one will&#39;?&quot; asked Souma.

&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;

&quot;If I can&#39;t have the Solar Priestess, no one will.&quot; Souma closed his 
eyes and continued the mantra, &quot;If I can&#39;t have the Solar Priestess, no 
one will. If I can&#39;t have the Solar Priestess, no one will.&quot;

&quot;What about the Lunar Priestess?&quot; asked Miyako. &quot;How can we defeat Ame 
no Murakumo without killing her?&quot;

&quot;I will deal with my daughter myself,&quot; said Takeshi. &quot;She will not be 
able to resist the orders of her father, nor the Orochi blood that runs 
through her veins.&quot;

&quot;So it&#39;s true then,&quot; said Tsubasa. &quot;I suspected this since I first met 
you. The reason why the Lunar Priestess could become Orochi&#39;s Eighth 
Neck. The reason why Orochi chose you as his vessel. Susanou is not the 
only god that you are descended from, is he?&quot;

&quot;Quite right, First Neck. After Orochi was defeated, Susanou decapitated 
each of his eight heads. When these heads were absorbed by the Earth, 
they spawned eight gods, the eight bodies of Orochi. Six of these gods 
bore offspring, Take no Yasukunazuchi, Yatsu no Onokoshizuchi, Ooube no 
Senazuchi, Ho no Shuraizuchi, Izuhara no Tamazuchi, and Yokusemi no 
Mizuchi.&quot;

&quot;Hi no Ashinazuchi didn&#39;t have children?&quot; Girochi asked.

&quot;Not Take no Yamikazuchi either?&quot; asked Souma.

&quot;Correct,&quot; Takeshi answered. &quot;Hi no Ashinazuchi would become the other 
self of a descendant of Yatsu no Onokoshizuchi and Take no Yamikazuchi 
would become the other self of a descendant of Take no Yasukunazuchi.&quot;

&quot;This is how the Orochi were born, am I right?&quot; said Korona.

&quot;Precisely,&quot; Takeshi continued. &quot;However, there was one body that 
decided to care for the offspring of the other gods. Just like a cuckoo 
bird, Yomusemi no Mizuchi left its offspring in the care of humans. Even 
though the eighth body&#39;s offspring was brought up as a human, the Orochi 
gene that Yokusemi no Mizuchi possessed was passed on to its offspring. 
It was only when Orochi revived that the gene would activate and the 
person in possession of the gene would learn of his Orochi heritage. It 
would simply take longer than that of the other offspring because the 
gene had been diluted by so many generations of living among humans.&quot;

Tsubasa then said, &quot;And the gene was passed on to the Himemiya family.&quot;

&quot;Yes. I, like all of you here, am a descendant of Orochi. As is my 
daughter.&quot;

----------

&quot;Aahh!&quot; Chikane cried in pain.

&quot;Chikane?&quot; Himeko asked, suddenly awake at hearing her beloved&#39;s cry. 
&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;My back...&quot; Chikane groaned.

Himeko pulled Chikane&#39;s long, black hair out of the way to see the Lunar 
Mark on her back glowing with a dark aura. &quot;Chikane!&quot; cried Himeko.

&quot;It&#39;s Orochi,&quot; said Chikane. &quot;He&#39;s nearby.&quot;

&quot;Where?&quot; asked Himeko. &quot;I can&#39;t sense anything.&quot;

&quot;How can that be?&quot; said Chikane, the stabbing pain in her back still 
cutting into her. &quot;This pain is too great for you to not sense it.&quot;

Chikane staggered to her feet and started walking. &quot;Chikane, where are 
you going?&quot; Himeko demanded an answer.

&quot;To find out the cause of this pain.&quot; As Chikane wandered off into the 
dark halls of the mansion, Himeko got up and quickly followed her.

----------

&quot;Go out,&quot; Takeshi commanded. &quot;Tear the human world apart. With the 
destruction of the human world, the world of the Orochi will begin!&quot; The 
evil aura emanating from Orochi&#39;s vessel filled the eight Necks with a 
darkness that burned within their hearts. Their eyes glowed red as 
winter cherries as Orochi&#39;s hold over them increased. &quot;Sing! Celebrate 
the beginning of a world of darkness stained with hatred and nihilism. 
My world! The world of the Orochi!&quot;

The Orochi members growled as the Orochi inside them cried for release. 
Their other selves appeared at their masters&#39; bidding. The metallic 
plates in front of the mechs&#39; mouths retracted and all seven of them 
bared their teeth. Take no Yasukunazuchi, Yatsu no Onokoshizuchi, and 
Ooube no Senazuchi were their usual shades of black, purple, and red 
repectively. Hi no Ashinazuchi&#39;s formerly orange coloration was now 
purple, Ho no Shuraizuchi was a deep shade of blue, Izuhara no Tamazuchi 
was as black as Take no Yasukunazuchi, and Take no Yamikazuchi was as 
red as Ooube no Senazuchi. The Orochi members disappeared into their 
other selves and the Orochi bodies descended into the clouds.

Takeshi smiled and said, &quot;I guess it&#39;s time for me to take my leave as 
well.&quot; In a flash of purple energy, he was gone.

----------

Chikane and Himeko walked through the mansion, searching for the source 
of the dark energy that was causing Chikane&#39;s Lunar Mark to flare up. As 
Chikane followed her senses, she saw Takeshi walk from behind a corner. 
&quot;Mister Himemiya,&quot; Chikane said.

&quot;Chikane,&quot; the man said. &quot;What are you doing up?&quot;

&quot;I could ask you the same thing.&quot;

&quot;I was out on one of my outings.&quot;

There was a brief pause. Chikane then responded, &quot;I see.&quot;

Himeko put her mouth close to Chikane&#39;s ear and whispered, &quot;Outings?&quot;

Chikane whispered back, &quot;Whenever my father can&#39;t sleep, he goes out 
walking to clear his mind. He never tells anybody where he goes. He just 
disappears, sometimes for hours.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps now is the time that I tell you, Chikane,&quot; said Takeshi.

&quot;Tell me what?&quot; Chikane asked.

&quot;Where I go on my outings.&quot;

Chikane was surprised, but still was curious. &quot;Where?&quot; she asked.

Takeshi started approaching the dark-haired girl, &quot;I was not planning on 
telling you until you turned eighteen. It has been the tradition of the 
Himemiyas to tell their eldest child on their eighteenth birthday about 
the legacy that they pass down. However, because Orochi has revived, we 
cannot wait any longer.&quot;

Chikane groaned as the stabbing pain in her back intensified. &quot;What is 
this?&quot;

&quot;Chikane, my daughter,&quot; Takeshi said. &quot;You are the Eighth Neck of the 
Orochi. You are the one that shall use Orochi&#39;s power to rebuild the 
world.&quot;

&quot;No. I&#39;m not an Orochi!&quot;

&quot;You cannot deny the blood that runs through your veins, Chikane. The 
blood that has been passed down through our family since the ages of the 
gods.&quot;

&quot;No! We&#39;re descended from Susanou, not Orochi!&quot;

Takeshi grabbed Chikane&#39;s shoulders and said, &quot;We&#39;re descended from 
both, Chikane! Who care about Susanou? We have the power inside of us to 
remake the world as we see fit. As soon as the Orochi destroy this 
world, we can rebuild it. And we can rule it together as father and 
daughter.&quot;

Takeshi looked at Chikane with his yellow eyes and Chikane cried in pain 
as Orochi&#39;s power tried to push its way into her body. &quot;Chikane!&quot; cried 
Himeko at seeing Chikane in pain.

&quot;Stay out of this, Solar Priestess!&quot; Takeshi commanded. He then looked 
at Chikane, whose eyes were glowing red like the rest of the Orochi. 
&quot;Join me, my daughter,&quot; Takeshi said.

&quot;You...aren&#39;t...my father,&quot; Chikane growled. Surprise appeared on 
Takeshi&#39;s face as the red glow of Chikane&#39;s eyes subsided. &quot;My father 
doesn&#39;t have those kind of eyes. He would never do anything to harm his 
daughter.&quot; Chikane then drew her tanto and said, &quot;And I won&#39;t let anyone 
hurt Himeko!&quot;

&quot;Are you going to kill me?&quot; Takeshi said. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t kill your own 
father, would you?&quot; Chikane gasped at what Takeshi said. Even though he 
had been tainted by Orochi&#39;s power, the man standing before her still 
looked so much like the man she knew.

Suddenly, the Solar Mark on Himeko&#39;s chest lit up and she cried, 
&quot;Chikane! An Orochi is coming!&quot;

&quot;Please, Chikane,&quot; Takeshi said. &quot;Don&#39;t let down your family name. The 
Orochi Faith must not die. It must be passed on, to your children and 
your children&#39;s children. So that we may protect our traditions and our 
power.&quot;

&quot;Chikane!&quot; Himeko cried.

Chikane looked back and forth between Takeshi and Himeko. She then said, 
&quot;I am the Lunar Priestess of Ame no Murakumo!&quot; She shoved Takeshi 
backwards, took Himeko&#39;s wrist and ran off into the halls of the 
mansion.

&quot;If that&#39;s what you&#39;ve chosen, Chikane,&quot; Takeshi said. He ran off in the 
opposite direction to a large painting of an early 20th century painting 
of a man that looked almost exactly like him. &quot;Father...&quot; he said before 
lifting the painting, revealing a secret flight of steps leading below 
the mansion.

----------

Chikane and Himeko ran into the bedroom that they were staying in, where 
their priestess robes were lying. They quickly changed into their 
priestess robes, flung open the window and jumped out. The Ame no 
Murakumo materialized around them and the giant god of swords flew off 
to fight the attacking Orochi.

To be continued...

----------

OMAKE:

Otoha took Himeko&#39;s hands in hers and said, &quot;Himeko, please. Will you 
accept me as your friend?&quot;

Himeko smiled and said. &quot;Otoha, I know that you and I have hardly ever 
seen eye-to-eye. But despite that, you still had the courage to ask for 
my friendship, even after the hard feelings that you&#39;ve felt toward me. 
I&#39;m honored that you have grown to think of me as a friend. And I would 
be happy to think of you as a friend too.&quot;

A large smile appeared on Otoha&#39;s face and she leapt toward Himeko, 
wrapping her arms around the shorter girl. &quot;Thank you, Himeko!&quot; After 
they parted, Otoha said, &quot;Himeko, you would share everything with me now 
that we&#39;re friends, right?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; said Himeko.

&quot;Then, maybe you could share Chikane with me just for one night?&quot;
