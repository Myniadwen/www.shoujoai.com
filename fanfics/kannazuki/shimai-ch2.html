<p>Himeko  slowly, lazily came awake, sleep receding gently like the tide going  out. It was a pleasant, drowsy feeling and yet somehow something  seemed wrong about it. The worry buzzed at her while consciousness  returned, until she was almost ready to face Monday morning.</p>
<p><em>Monday.</em></p>
<p>That  was it. She shouldn't be waking up naturally on a Monday! Where was  the shrill beep of the alarm clock, or Chikane's insistent voice?  What was going on?</p>
<p>She  opened her eyes and found herself staring into the eyes of a pink  teddy bear that was cradling a red rose and a folded slip of paper in  its plush arms. Himeko rubbed the sleep from her own eyes and read  the note.</p>
<p><em>Himeko,</em></p>
<p><em>I'm  sorry I couldn't be there in person to say it, but since you don't  have any classes until eleven I wanted to let you sleep. Shall we  have lunch at our usual place?</em></p>
<p><em>Happy  birthday,</em></p>
<p><em>Chikane</em></p>
<p>Himeko  set the note down and sighed happily.</p>
<p>&quot;Isn't  she sweet, Mr. Bear? Or maybe Miss Bear, since you're pink?&quot; She  squeezed the stuffed toy. &quot;Oh, you're almost as soft and  huggable as Chikane. It had better be Mr. Bear; I don't want to hug  any other girl.&quot; She set the bear back down, took the time to  smell the rosebud, then got dressed. The last thing she did before  she left the room was slip her gift for Chikane into her bag along  with her books. They'd probably exchange gifts over lunch, but even  if they didn't she wasn't going to leave it behind. &quot;You never  know what might happen!&quot; she told the bear.</p>

<p>The  dark sun was a serpent's eye. It looked into the hearts and souls of  the humans that crawled like ants across the face of the world,  sought out those whose hatred had corrupted them into something  greater, whose rage made them stand out, whose despair had  transfigured them. It found them, eight of them, and it sent its  shining darkness into their hearts. They were the dark sun's  extensions into the world, the necks that captured its prey.</p>
<p>And  it would give them fangs.</p>
<p><strong>Awaken.</strong></p>
<p>Junichi  Ozawa sat bolt upright in his jail cell. He could feel it, twitching  beneath his skin like electricity along his nerves.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey,  man, what's wrong?&quot; his cellmate suddenly asked. &quot;You on a  bad trip or something?&quot;</p>
<p>Ozawa  held up a hand, clenching it into a fist. The rage mounted within  him, and as it did violet flames seemed to cloud his vision.</p>
<p><strong>Those  of despair.</strong></p>
<p>Akemi  Kuroda's fingers slipped as she ran the whetstone along the knife's  edge, so that it dropped onto the table next to the three blades  she'd already sharpened. The voice seemed to bubble up from the  depths of her soul, whispering at her, but it was different than the  voices she usually heard, stronger, cleaner.</p>
<p>It  told her that the world was full of Kazuos. There were always more  of them, breeding in the cracks, in the cesspools of humanity. She'd  never finish the work of removing them. Not one by one.</p>
<p><strong>Those  of shattered dreams.</strong></p>
<p>Keiichi  Hirata's hand jerked as he heard the voice, smearing a swatch of  paint across the work. <em>Gah!  It's ruined!</em> echoed in his mind. The work he'd put into it, the painstaking  effort was all gone. But what did it matter, anyway? This wasn't art  or craftsmanship, it was like being an office drudge, all routine  tasks to finish, only it was worse because it mocked him, mocked his  spirit, mocked his hopes and dreams and everything he'd wanted to be.  The world had looked at him and judged his craft to be worthless,  that only in copying others could he be valued.</p>
<p>Who  would want to live in a world like that? Who could tolerate it?</p>
<p><strong>Those  of Orochi.</strong></p>
<p>Saori  Takamine flung her cell phone onto the bed viciously. That was the  fifth time, the <em>fifth</em>!  These women were supposed to be her <em>friends</em>,  damn it! They'd come from the same place, fought and clawed their way  up, washed off the scum of the streets, painted and polished and won  their way free, <em>damn</em> it!  But now, not one of them would help her, introduce her to new  clients, new hopes. Oh, they'd been properly apologetic, and Mina  had even offered to toss a crumb or two her way in the way of routine  work, but there was nothing in that. The unspoken message had been  there, those words ringing loud and clear though never articulated: <em>You're  too old.</em></p>
<p>She'd  thought she was free, thought she'd bettered herself, but now she  knew better. It was the world that had plucked her up by chance,  used her for a time until she'd come to believe it was due to  something special in her, then thrown her away when it had taken what  it wanted.</p>
<p>But  now, the voice whispered, she knew there truly <em>was</em> something  special in her. And it was the world that would pay.</p>
<p><strong>Arise.</strong></p>
<p>They'd  been there at the funeral, of course. It was, after all, an  obligation, and Yuujirou Abe's co-workers were very attentive to  duty. Chief Executive Officer Nishida had attended in person to  offer his condolences on behalf of the company.</p>
<p>Only  the thought of the insult to his wife's spirit had kept Abe from  wrapping his hands around the old man's throat and throttling every  last hypocritical word from his body.</p>
<p>Everything  he'd done was for nothing. He'd worked hard, believing himself part  of a family of colleagues, men and women doing their best for one  another and each other's families, the urban equivalent of how  farmers or fishermen would pull together in rural villages to ensure  the welfare of all. But they weren't a village. They weren't a  family. They were the hired minions of old men bloated on greed who  lied to them to extract more value without having to compensate them  for it.</p>
<p>But  it would change. The dark sun that had taken fire in his heart told  him how they could be made to pay. The users in power. The drones  who connived at their own slavery. The whole, stinking world that  had taken everything of value from him.</p>
<p><strong>Destroy  the Solar Priestess.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Damn,  Kei, you look like you've been through the wringer,&quot; the  girl--Kei Tsujimura thought her name was Eriko, though he wasn't  certain--marveled. She didn't know the half of it; he was stiff and  sore all over besides the ugly bruises and the only reason he hadn't  needed a trip to the hospital was because Mori's thug knew exactly  what he was doing, was an expert at his craft.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't  worry, babe. Let's just say the important parts are all working, if  you get my drift.&quot;</p>
<p>She  wrinkled her nose.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,  right. Maybe one day when you don't look like something the cat  dragged in. You think I want my friends to see me hanging with a guy  that looks like he's from some zombie flick?&quot; Maybe-Eriko  sniffed, spun, and walked away from him. Her stiletto heels made her  hips swivel, but they seemed to intentionally mock Kei, taunting him  with what he couldn't have. Yet another person saying they were <em>better</em> than he was, that he was some piece of trash they found useful, just  like that girl had when she'd been hot and looking for action a month  ago. But he didn't belong; he was only worth their attention so long  as he was useful, and when that moment passed it was good riddance to  Kei.</p>
<p>Well,  maybe it was time to change. The holier-than-thou assholes who used  him and tossed him out, it was his turn to show them that <em>he</em> was  the one that didn't need <em>them</em>!</p>
<p><em><strong>Destroy  the Lunar Priestess!</strong></em></p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>&quot;Happy  birthday, Miya-sama!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Happy  birthday!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Congratulations!  Happy birthday!&quot;</p>
<p>It  had been that way the whole morning for Chikane. A good  three-fourths of her fellow students in each class would offer their  birthday wishes either before or after the class started. She  politely thanked each of them for their kindness. Some offered  gifts, but these she demurred, as she had since junior high. Accepting, she felt, would create a level of intimacy, imply the  existence of a connection that she didn't feel or want. Chikane was  polite about it, though; she didn't want to hurt anyone, either, and  there were probably some whose feelings were sincere.</p>
<p>And  it wasn't as if she could announce that she was seeing someone to  chase away the infatuated.</p>
<p>She  slipped her notebooks into her satchel and checked her watch. She  was running behind, but still would be able to make it to the fine  arts building for her music class without having to sprint across  campus. It would be undignified, a crack in her armor, and she hated  that. The perfect Miya-sama could keep people comfortably at bay,  but ordinary Tsukuyo Asamiya wasn't so good at that. Sometimes she  envied Himeko her free and easy ways, the honesty with which she  accepted her own feelings.</p>
<p>Chikane  turned towards the door, but another girl blocked her path between  the rows of desks. They were the last two people in the classroom;  the girl had obviously waited for the rest of the class to clear out  before approaching her. Chikane's heart sank.</p>
<p>&quot;Mi--I  mean, Tsukuyo? Can I talk to you for a minute?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  running late for my next class, Reiko. Can it wait until after  lunch?&quot;</p>
<p>She  knew Reiko Himemiya, of course. Chikane had been a little curious to  learn that the Himemiya family had a daughter within two months of  her own age, an odd coincidence given her past life.</p>
<p>Reiko  bit her lip.</p>
<p>&quot;It  won't take long,&quot; she said quietly and a little defensively.</p>
<p>Chikane  gave in. If Himeko could sprint to classes without getting uptight  over it, so could she.</p>
<p>&quot;All  right. Is it about tonight's party?&quot; No doubt Reiko was footing  a large slice of the bill.</p>
<p>&quot;Sort  of,  but not really, though.&quot; Reiko took a deep breath. &quot;Tsukuyo, I know  that I'm not the most beautiful or charming  girl in the school. I mean, you'd be a far better heiress than I am.  Whenever Father introduces me to someone important, I just want to  hide behind a potted plant.&quot;</p>
<p>That  was, unfortunately, the truth.</p>
<p>&quot;Reiko,&quot;  Chikane tried to be supportive, &quot;you don't have anything to be  ashamed of. You're a good person in your own right: earnest and  generous, a good student...&quot; She racked her brain for  compliments and came up short. She just didn't know Reiko well  enough to say anything worthwhile.</p>
<p>Reiko  sniffled a little.</p>
<p>&quot;Th-thank  you, Tsukuyo.&quot; Apparently Chikane's meager offering had meant  something, which was perhaps the saddest part of the whole  conversation. &quot;It's just that next to someone as beautiful and  good as you--&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  not  that good a person. I've done many things that I regret. Hikari  could tell you about them, the many times I've taken the wrong path.  You know what the Christians say about the road to Hell being paved  with good intentions.&quot; She stopped herself firmly. Gods, she  was becoming maudlin, and Reiko didn't want to hear her whine.</p>
<p>&quot;Hikari  could, huh?&quot;</p>
<p><em>That's  odd</em>,  Chikane thought. It almost sounded like...</p>
<p>&quot;But  then, why should I be surprised?&quot; Reiko went on. &quot;Everything  is always about <em>her</em>,  isn't  it? Everyone has always loved you, ever since we were children. You  were always a gentle light shining on all of us, lifting us out  of the darkness of our petty, commonplace lives. But we were <em>nothing</em> to  you! Our names, our faces memorized by rote, but you never accepted  our love in return, only allowed you to worship you from afar. Only  Hikari could come close to you, to shine any light back upon your  life.&quot;</p>
<p>It  poured out of Reiko in a torrent of frustration, her jealousy and  thwarted desires crashing over Chikane with an almost physical force. It actually made Chikane flinch away from her.</p>
<p><em>This  malice and despair I feel from her...it feels like...</em></p>
<p>&quot;To  everyone else, to <em>me</em>,  you were just like your name, as cold and remote as the moon!&quot;</p>
<p>Something  dark flickered in the depths of her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Or  should I say, Lunar Priestess!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Orochi!&quot;  Chikane gasped, flinging herself aside as Reiko's palm swung towards  her. It was just a girl's wild slap, but her hand crackled with  violet and black lightning.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot;  Reiko shouted, clenching her fists. &quot;Finally I have the  strength to express my feelings, to let you know the pain you've  caused me and everyone else who cares for you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  didn't ask for your feelings,&quot; Chikane snapped. &quot;You're  the one forcing them on me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Didn't  you? Always so composed, always carrying yourself with such grace and  poise and perfection? How were we supposed to feel when a goddess  descended among us?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  snarled.</p>
<p>&quot;So  this is why you've fallen into darkness, Reiko? Because you've built  an illusion of me up in your mind and you can't stand that there's a  difference between your fantasy and my real feelings?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've  loved you for years!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You've  loved <em>nothing</em> but a dream of your own ego!&quot;</p>
<p>Reiko  screamed, then slapped her hand against the edge of a desk, launching  it up across the room. Chikane barely dodged in time and the desk  crushed itself to a shower of splinters against the wall from the  force of the impact.</p>
<p><em>There's  a plan, Chikane. Make her mad at you</em>. Why hadn't she thought about this possibility, not Reiko  specifically but that <em>some</em> Orochi  would appear? Was she that content with the ordinary life she'd  shared with Himeko these nineteen years?</p>
<p>She  needed a weapon, a plan, <em>something</em>. The crackling violet and black energies were playing freely across  Reiko's body now, and a shape seemed to be manifesting in the air  around her, a translucent image of an armored knight with rotting  wings, a long, straight sword clenched in its fist.</p>
<p>&quot;Do  you recognize it, Lunar Priestess? The Shadow of the god, Take no  Sukunazuchi. Can you stand against its power, Tsukuyo?&quot;</p>
<p>Reiko  held up her hand, and the Shadow flowed and coalesced into her palm,  the translucence becoming solidity as it formed itself into a  jet-black sword, its blade long and straight, the quillions curving  like horns.</p>
<p>Chikane  bolted for the door, but Reiko whipped her arm up in an arc, light  bursting from the blade and blowing a chunk out of the wall.</p>
<p>&quot;No,  no, you can't leave. This is <em>our</em> party,  a dance for just the two of us. I've been nothing up until now, but  in the end I'll be the last thing you'll think of.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  was afraid she was right. The willingness to fight was one thing,  but against the Orochi, what could she do? The black sword might not  have had the sheer physical intimidation of the mecha-like metal  titan from Chikane's memories, but she'd already seen what it could  do.</p>
<p>Reiko  charged,  slicing down in a powerful overhand swing. Chikane pivoted  aside at the last second, hooked her foot against the Orochi's  ankles, and pushed Reiko hard in the back. She went stumbling past,  crashing into the teacher's desk and then falling over completely.  Chikane turned to run, when she was stopped by the echoes of a  feminine voice in her head.</p>
<p><strong>Awaken.</strong></p>
<p>Memories  bottled up within her. memories she knew well but that nonetheless  came to life, replaying in her mind the final confrontation with  Himeko, her own relentless desire to die and Himeko's equal, no far  stronger refusal to let her, Himeko's &quot;I love you&quot;s echoing  over and over as she wielded them like weapons against Chikane's  doubts and fear.</p>
<p><strong>Maidens  who shine upon the mortal world's night and day, awaken.</strong></p>
<p>A  heat seemed to burn from Chikane's back, between her shoulder blades.</p>
<p><strong>Solar  Priestess! Lunar Priestess!</strong></p>
<p>Chikane  swayed as the visions released her, but Reiko was up and coming at  her again, sword held low in a thrusting position. Chikane clapped  her hands together, catching the blade. She could feel a hideous  cold radiating from Reiko's weapon, but a gentle warmth seemed to be  keeping it from her hands. Chikane twisted the blade away and down,  then released it and drove the heel of her hand into Reiko's face,  breaking the girl's nose and sending her reeling back. Chikane  bolted for the door, but another scream from Reiko had her diving and  rolling aside in the hall as another burst of violet energy pierced  the air where she had been.</p>
<p>Running  wasn't going to be enough to shake off the Orochi, Chikane realized,  but now, perhaps, she had a weapon to use. The awakening had  quickened something within her as it had been quickened within Reiko.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Ame  no Murakumo no Tsurugi! May the moon's light capture this place  within its radiance!&quot;</em></p>
<p>A  pale light sprang up, blocking the doorway just before Reiko reached  it; she rebounded off it as if it was a wall--which for all intents  and purposes it was; Chikane's invocation had bound the classroom as  a sealed space within a barrier.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,  there was no way the barrier would hold Reiko for long, not while she  wielded the power of Take no Sukunazuchi. She lashed out against it  and tiny white lines threaded through the pale light, radiating out  from the point of impact like fractures in a glass window. Chikane  ran for it, bolting down the hall and into the stairwell, stopping on  the second-floor landing and enclosed the third floor within a second  barrier. She then continued down the stairs at a dead run and  crashed through the doors at the bottom leading out onto the sunlit  campus. She then turned back, and though the effort brought on a  stabbing pain behind her eyes she created yet another sealed space,  this one encompassing the entire building. With luck, she could get  far enough away, out of sight so Reiko wouldn't see her by the time  she broke out of the last bounded area.</p>
<p>She  couldn't afford to waste any more time with this fight. Even as an  awakened--no, <em>partially</em> awakened--priestess, she wasn't likely to win one-on-one against  Reiko, and there was something more important she needed to be doing  anyway.</p>
<p><em>Himeko.</em></p>
<p>More  than one head turned as Chikane wove her way between students at a  full-tilt sprint. Just a few minutes ago she'd actually been worried  about that, about looking foolish or undignified while doing this  very thing, yet now she did it without hesitation. If the Orochi  were coming after her, the Lunar Priestess, then they would be just  as eager to destroy the Solar Priestess. Himeko might have been  adequate in battle with a priestess's sword in her hand, but beyond  that her martial skills were nowhere near Chikane's. She had to get  to Himeko, to protect her.</p>
<p><em>Who  am I trying to fool?</em> she thought ruefully. Even if Himeko had been the greatest warrior  in history, Chikane would still be doing what she was doing then. The  desire to protect wasn't based upon some logical analysis of  risks, but came from her heart.</p>
<p>The  twins knew each other's class schedules, so Chikane had a fairly good  idea of where she'd find Himeko: somewhere between the  foreign-language lab and the applied sciences building. She took a  sharp right around the central fountain, nearly crashing into a knot  of upperclassmen. One jerked back suddenly from the near-contact and  his canned coffee spilled, splattering across the front of Chikane's  shirt. He started to apologize, but she didn't so much as wait to  brush it off and say it was her fault, but wove through the students  and kept right on going, leaving them shaking their heads in  disbelief.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>&quot;And  then she said <em>what</em>?  Man, that's cold!&quot; Uetake laughed, rubbing the back of his head.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,  yeah,&quot; Kajiyama replied. &quot;Dude's usually about as thick as  a brick, but he got the message all right. Looked like he wanted to  melt through the floor!&quot;</p>
<p>The  two boys were classmates of Himeko's in her calculus section; they'd  met on the way to class. They were nice enough, but she was feeling  terribly embarrassed since they'd started discussing how Chikane had  turned down--publicly, sharply, and very throughly--the attempt of  another boy to ask her out.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm...I'm  very sorry for your friend,&quot; Himeko offered.</p>
<p>&quot;Geez,  Hikari, don't <em>apologize</em>,&quot;  Uetake said. &quot;Guy got what was coming to him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  his feelings must have been badly hurt.&quot;</p>
<p>Kajiyama  laughed sharply.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,  man, that just makes it worse! He gets shot down in flames and the  girl's sister feels sorry for him!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hikari,  you're a nice kid, but this is a matter of pride as a man. You do <em>not</em> approach a girl like your sister with a weak game and cornball lines. It makes all of us look like chumps,&quot; Uetake explained,  somewhat melodramatically. &quot;Cheesy pick-up lines only work if  the girl was into you to begin with. Guy makes an honest try from  the heart, it's a different story. We've all been there. But you do  your thinking from somewhere a little south of there and it blows up  in your face, hell yeah we're gonna point fingers and laugh.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  guess if you put it that way,&quot; Himeko said tentatively.</p>
<p>Suddenly,  there  was a loud boom, like a clap of thunder or a firework going up. Their  conversation forgotten, the three students looked around in  confusion and shock like everyone else near them was.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey,  over there!&quot; Uetake said and pointed to where a plume of black,  inky smoke was rising like a dark stain into the sky.</p>
<p>&quot;Man,  was it a gas leak? Some kind of bomb?&quot; The two boys drifted  off, trying to get a better look.</p>
<p>The  memories struck Himeko like a fist clamped around her heart, of a  previous birthday when violence had erupted at her school, heralding  the return of the Orochi. <em>No,  it can't be...</em></p>
<p>&quot;Himeko!&quot;</p>
<p>Her  head snapped around in the direction of the voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  was sprinting towards her at a dead run.</p>
<p>&quot;Come  on, Himeko; we have to get out of here!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane,  what's wrong?&quot; Her hair was wild and askew, her clothing  rumpled, and a large brown stain was splashed across the front of her  blouse.</p>
<p>&quot;Reiko  is a Neck of Orochi! She attacked me in the classroom after Japanese  literature.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;  Himeko squeaked. &quot;I don't understand! Reiko...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Reiko  Himemiya. Maybe it runs in the bloodline, somehow. That's not  important, though. What matters is that we have to get you out of  here <em>now</em>,  before she or one of the others comes after you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then  that explosion...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  trapped  her in the building so I could get away. She must have  broken out. Come on, Himeko; we need to get to the Ohgami Shrine. It's  protected by barriers that will prevent them from being able to  sense our location.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  shook her head, bewildered. This wasn't making any sense at all. It  wasn't that she didn't understand about the Orochi, of course; the <em>concept</em> she  understood. But the <em>feeling</em> was missing. The last time, even while she'd had no idea what was  actually happening, she'd been aware of <em>something</em>,  a kind of feeling that bound herself to the attacking Orochi and to  her fellow priestess even before she'd actually known that Chikane <em>was</em> the  Lunar Priestess. The shared destiny that encompassed them all  created a link between them that she'd felt even if she hadn't  understood it.</p>
<p>This  was different. Himeko now had knowledge of what the Orochi were, of  their goals, and of her own role as Solar Priestess, but the feeling  was gone, the emotion. Everything was strictly operating on an  intellectual level, and it confused her.</p>
<p>Chikane  had  taken her by the hand and was all but dragging her towards the  entrance to the campus, intent on getting her away from the Orochi. She  clearly didn't have any of these problems, but for Himeko, the  questions had to be answered..</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane,  wait!&quot;</p>
<p>She  dug her heels in, pulled them to a stop.</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko,  we can't stand around here. Reiko could be after us any minute now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,  I don't see any giant robots stomping through the trees right now, so  I think I deserve an answer!&quot; She shut her mouth quickly,  slightly ashamed of losing her temper in that fashion, but it did  work because it brought Chikane up short. She hesitated a moment,  and when she did speak her voice was quiet, almost cowed.</p>
<p>&quot;There  wasn't any 'giant robot' or anything like that. It was just her,  although she was surrounded by a dark aura that she called the Shadow  of Take no Sukunazuchi. That's the name of the god of the First  Neck.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  still, you beat her?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;No;  all I managed to do was run away. If I hadn't awakened as Lunar  Priestess I wouldn't have ever done that; I just kept stacking  barriers in her path.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko's  eyes widened.</p>
<p>&quot;You...awakened  as Lunar Priestess?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just  in time. I understood that Ame no Murakumo calls to us in response  to the Orochi Necks being awakened, but that gap of time...wait,  Himeko, why are you asking? The call is to Lunar and Solar Priestess  together, so you must have...&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  shook her head, her puzzlement mounting.</p>
<p>&quot;No,  that's why I'm so confused, and...&quot;</p>
<p>As  usual, Chikane got to the answer first, and the sudden fear in her  expression told Himeko that it wasn't a good answer. Chikane's  fingers flew to the slight V-neck of Himeko's shirt. It was a modest  dip that barely exposed below the hollow of her throat, but Chikane  changed that in a hurry, tearing it open nearly to her belly button.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane!  What are you--&quot; Himeko yelped, but the shocked, almost fearful  look on her beloved's face stopped her. &quot;Chikane, what is it?&quot;</p>
