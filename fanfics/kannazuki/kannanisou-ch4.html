<h1>Spiral of Destiny (part 4 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kannazuki/index.html">Kannazuki no Miko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nwarford.html">Nathan Warford</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kannazuki/kannanisou-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;Himemiya residence,&quot; a female voice said, &quot;Otoha Kisaragi speaking.&quot; 

Chikane froze. It was Otoha that had picked up the phone! Chikane was 
speaking with the one person that she had spent more time with than 
anyone else in her life. Even though they generally spoke to each other 
only when it dealt with household happenings or family business, until 
hearing Otoha&#39;s voice, Chikane never realized just how much she had 
missed her former maid. 

&quot;Hello?&quot; Otoha asked again. 

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; said Chikane, holding Himeko&#39;s cellular phone to her 
ear. &quot;I was hoping that I could speak to Mister Himemiya if he has the 
time.&quot; 

&quot;This is about that incident downtown this afternoon, isnt it?&quot; asked 
Otoha. &quot;You are the twenty-seventh person to have asked for Mister 
Himemiya&#39;s assistance. I can assure you that the Himemiya family will 
attend to everyone&#39;s needs.&quot; 

&quot;Please, Otoha,&quot; said Chikane with urgency in her voice. &quot;I would be 
eternally grateful if--&quot; 

&quot;Wait,&quot; said Otoha, interrupting Chikane. &quot;That&#39;s odd, he&#39;s right here.&quot; 

There was a brief pause. Then, a strong, but gentle male voice said on 
the phone, &quot;Hello, this is Takeshi Himemiya.&quot; 

Again, Chikane went stiff. It was her father! At long last, she was 
speaking with her father again. Tears formed in the corners of her eyes 
at hearing Takeshi Himemiya&#39;s voice. &quot;Mister Himemiya,&quot; Chikane said, 
trying her best not to let him hear the emotion in her voice. She wiped 
her tears and said, &quot;I was hoping that I could have a word with you.&quot; 

&quot;About the destruction earlier today, right?&quot; her father asked. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Chikane. 

&quot;Are you injured in any way?&quot; 

&quot;No, but I do not have a place to stay.&quot; 

&quot;Is there no one that you know whose residence you can stay at?&quot; 

&quot;No one.&quot; 

&quot;Would you like me to arrange an accommodation for you somewhere in town 
Miss...?&quot; 

Her father was asking for her name. Chikane could not answer &quot;Himemiya&quot; 
as Takeshi Himemiya never had a daughter in that reality. She thought 
quickly and said the first name that came to mind. &quot;Murakumo,&quot; she 
answered. &quot;Chikane Murakumo.&quot; 

&quot;Chikane?&quot; her father asked. &quot;That was what we were going to name our 
daughter if we had one.&quot; Chikane&#39;s face turned warm and she felt the 
tears threatening to come forth again. &quot;Would you like to come by so 
that we can arrange a place for you to stay, Miss Murakumo?&quot; 

&quot;Thank you very much, Mister Himemiya.&quot; 

&quot;I will arrange a taxi to pick you up if you could give me a time and 
place.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s not necessary, Sir. I can get myself there.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, Sir. Quite sure. When is the best time to come by your estate?&quot; 

&quot;Well, I just finished setting up my new business, so I have a lot more 
time on my hands than I had a few days ago. What time is best for you?&quot; 

&quot;I can make it there in about fifteen minutes if that meets your 
approval.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s just fine, Miss Murakumo. I will be awaiting you.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you very much, Sir. I won&#39;t make you wait too long. Good bye.&quot; 
Chikane hung up and turned to the blond-haired girl beside her. &quot;Thank 
you, Himeko,&quot; she said holding out the cell phone for Himeko to take. 

&quot;Chikane?&quot; Himeko asked, seeing the tears in Chikane&#39;s eyes. 

Chikane smiled in mild embarrassment. Himeko put her hands to Chikane&#39;s 
face and wiped the tears away. &quot;The sun as my handkerchief,&quot; Chikane 
mused. &quot;I...just spoke with my father,&quot; said Chikane, explaining what 
had forced her tears to the surface. &quot;There are so many things that I 
missed when I was away. Hopefully I can regain part of what was lost.&quot; 

&quot;I hope so too,&quot; said Himeko. &quot;Oh,&quot; she remembered, &quot;I should call Mako. 
She&#39;s probably worried sick about me.&quot; Himeko took the phone from 
Chikane and started dialing. 

The phone in their dorm room rang several times before someone picked 
up. &quot;Himeko?&quot; a frantic Mako cried. 

&quot;It&#39;s all right, Mako,&quot; said Himeko. &quot;I&#39;m just fine.&quot; 

&quot;Himeko,&quot; Mako said, &quot;I heard about what happened. I knew that you were 
downtown and I was worried. What in the world is going on down there?&quot; 

&quot;I wish I could explain it.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re on your way back, aren&#39;t you?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll be back later, Mako. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, don&#39;t worry about me, really.&quot; 

&quot;All right. But don&#39;t be back too late, you hear?&quot; 

&quot;Right. See you later, Mako.&quot; Himeko hung up and put the phone back into 
her shoulder bag. &quot;Okay,&quot; she said. &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; Himeko held Chikane&#39;s 
right hand with her left and the two girls started walking toward the 
Himemiya residence. 

---------- 

At that time, Takeshi and Rika Himemiya were dressing themselves up for 
a formal meeting with Chikane Murakumo. Takeshi, although middle-aged, 
was still very handsome. He had a full head of dark gray hair and soft, 
brown eyes, and his tall, fit stature reflected his status as an 
aristocrat. His wife, Rika, was just as stunning with flowing, dark blue 
hair and serene, blue eyes. 

The maid, Otoha Kisaragi, was waiting for them as they entered the great 
hall at the front of the mansion. &quot;Sir, Missus,&quot; said Otoha. &quot;Might I 
ask a question?&quot; 

&quot;Certainly, Otoha,&quot; said Takeshi. 

&quot;If you don&#39;t mind me asking, Sir,&quot; Otoha asked, &quot;why are you allowing 
commoners to come by to meet with you? You did make generous donations 
to the Kamiyatate University Medical Center as well as the construction 
agencies of the prefecture. So why make an appointment to meet a with a 
victim personally?&quot; 

&quot;The truth is, I don&#39;t fully understand it myself,&quot; the man replied, 
straitening his tie. &quot;There was just something about that girl&#39;s voice 
that made me want to help her.&quot; A knocking came at the door. &quot;That must 
be Miss Murakumo,&quot; Takeshi said to himself. He then said to the maid, 
&quot;Otoha, could you get that?&quot; 

&quot;Of course, Sir,&quot; said Otoha with a short bow to her employer. She went 
to the large, front door and answered it. Standing in the doorway were 
two girls. The taller one was dressed completely in white and had an 
aristocratic air about her, similar to the one that Mister Himemiya 
carried. The shorter girl dressed a little more casually and had a less 
intimidating demeanor. &quot;Miss Murakumo, I presume?&quot; Otoha said to the 
taller woman with a smile. 

The girl looked straight at Otoha for a moment, as if entranced by some 
feature that the maid carried. Much to Otoha&#39;s surprise, she felt a 
similar sensation when she looked at the taller girl. &quot;Yes,&quot; the girl 
managed to reply. &quot;I am Chikane Murakumo.&quot; 

&quot;Please, come in,&quot; said Otoha. She felt her heart pounding in her chest 
as she admitted the two young women into the house. 

&quot;Mister and Missus Himemiya,&quot; said Chikane as she approached the two 
adults before her. 

&quot;Miss Murakumo,&quot; said Takeshi. &quot;Nice to meet you.&quot; 

&quot;My goodness,&quot; said Rika, &quot;you&#39;re a spinning image of me when I was your 
age.&quot; 

&quot;I bet you were just as beautiful as you are today,&quot; Chikane said. 

&quot;And who did you bring with you?&quot; asked Takeshi, noticing the shorter, 
blond-haired girl standing next to Chikane. 

&quot;Pleased to meet you, Mister Himemiya,&quot; said the girl. &quot;My name is 
Himeko Kurusugawa. I&#39;m a good friend of Chikane.&quot; 

&quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind that I brought her along,&quot; Chikane said. 

&quot;If I&#39;m a bother I can always go back to the dormitory where I live.&quot; 

&quot;Not at all,&quot; said Rika. &quot;We enjoy having guests over. Of course, guests 
are usually family members, celebrities, and Takeshi&#39;s business 
associates. But sometimes it&#39;s nice to meet with normal people every now 
and then.&quot; 

&quot;Living up to one&#39;s own reputation can be a difficult task,&quot; Takeshi 
added. 

&quot;Is that so?&quot; Chikane asked, acting as if she did not know how difficult 
it was to be smothered by countless admirers day after day. 

Himeko and Chikane followed Takeshi and Rika up the large flight of 
stairs toward the conference room. Chikane and Himeko looked around, 
seeing the house exactly as it was in the other reality. The red 
carpets, the chandelier overhead, the stone sculptures by the staircase, 
everything was exactly the same. But where Himeko had spent only a month 
there, Chikane and spent sixteen years in that house. It was much more 
difficult for Chikane to keep the tears of joy from staining the 
beautiful carpets. 

As Himeko, Chikane, Takeshi, and Rika made their way upstairs, Otoha 
watched the dark-haired girl attentively. &#39;Chikane Murakumo,&#39; the maid 
thought to herself. &#39;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen someone so beautiful. She 
looks like an angel.&#39; Otoha was surprised by her own thoughts. &#39;What am 
I thinking?&#39; she wondered, shaking the feeling off. 

&quot;Otoha,&quot; said Takeshi just before he, Rika, Himeko, and Chikane rounded 
the corner out of sight, &quot;would you bring us a pot of tea, please?&quot; 

&quot;Uh, of course, Sir,&quot; said Otoha as the four disappeared from her sight. 
With the beautiful, bluish-black-haired girl no longer in her sights, 
Otoha was not distracted from making her way to the kitchen to make the 
tea. 

As Himeko, Chikane, and the Himemiyas entered the conference room, Rika 
said to the two girls, &quot;You should be honored to be accepted into our 
home.&quot; 

&quot;We are very grateful to be given this honor,&quot; said Himeko, bowing to 
Mr. and Mrs. Himemiya. Chikane bowed as well. 

The four of them sat down, ready to start talking. &quot;Now then,&quot; Takeshi 
said, &quot;Miss Murakumo. Your house was destroyed, correct?&quot; 

Chikane hated to lie to the people she knew as her parents. After a 
brief pause, she formulated a response that was mostly true, &quot;The house 
that I have lived in for the past year was destroyed today, yes.&quot; 

&quot;Do you have any idea about the kind of place you would want to stay in 
until your house is rebuilt?&quot; asked Takeshi. 

&quot;Some place close by,&quot; Chikane answered. &quot;I have not seen Himeko for a 
long time and it would be nice if I could be close, somewhere in 
Mahoroba.&quot; 

&quot;From what I&#39;ve heard on the news,&quot; said Rika, &quot;most of the hotels in 
Mahoroba were destroyed as well.&quot; 

&quot;What about Miss Kurusugawa?&quot; Takeshi inquired. He then turned to the 
shorter girl and asked, &quot;You live at the Ototachibana Academy Dormitory, 
right?&quot; 

&quot;Oh,&quot; Himeko answered, not quite expecting to be addressed. &quot;Well,&quot; she 
answered, &quot;I live in a two-person room, but I already have a roommate. 
And I don&#39;t think Mako would be very happy to have another person move 
in for such a long time.&quot; 

&quot;This is a tight situation,&quot; Takeshi said, putting his hand to his chin 
and narrowing his eyes, pondering the possibilities. 

Just then, there was a knock at the door. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; Otoha&#39;s voice 
said from behind the door, &quot;the tea is ready.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you, Otoha,&quot; said Takeshi. &quot;Come in.&quot; 

The door opened and Otoha entered with a serving cart. A tea pot, four 
cups and saucers, and a bowl of sugar cubes on the cart. &quot;Would you like 
sugar in your tea?&quot; asked Otoha. 

&quot;None for me, thank you,&quot; Takeshi answered. 

&quot;None for me either,&quot; Rika said. 

&quot;One cube please, Otoha,&quot; said Chikane. 

Otoha, Takeshi, and Rika all looked at Chikane, with a look of surprise 
on their faces. Chikane realized that she had slipped up. She was not 
supposed to know the Himemiyas or their maid in this reality. After a 
moment, she said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t have been so rude, calling 
Miss Kisaragi by name.&quot; 

&quot;No, that&#39;s okay,&quot; said Takeshi. &quot;I know that commoners are used to a 
level of familiarity. No worries.&quot; Although she tried to hide her 
anxiety, Chikane could feel herself blushing. She turned to Otoha and 
said, &quot;So, one cube please?&quot; It was difficult for Chikane to not do the 
things that she had done in the past like calling her maids by name. It 
took all the willpower she had not to call her parents &quot;Mother and 
&quot;Father&quot;. 

&quot;Yes, Miss Murakumo,&quot; said Otoha. She then looked at Himeko and said, 
&quot;And for you, Miss Kurusugawa?&quot; 

&quot;Oh, one cube for me too,&quot; Himeko answered. 

&quot;Yes, Miss.&quot; 

As Otoha poured the tea into the tea cups, the four continued their 
conversation. &quot;How can we accommodate Miss Murakumo?&quot; Takeshi asked 
himself out loud. &quot;With all of the hotels destroyed, it will be 
difficult to find lodging for her.&quot; 

Chikane and Himeko looked on anxiously. Not wanting to sound forward, 
Chikane did not speak, fearful that Takeshi and Rika would be angry at 
her for asking to stay with them. 

Rika then said, &quot;Is it possible she could stay in one of the bedrooms?&quot; 
Otoha nearly dropped Chikane&#39;s tea at hearing Rika&#39;s words. &quot;We&#39;re not 
expecting company any time soon.&quot; 

&quot;That is true,&quot; Takeshi agreed. Turning to Chikane he said, &quot;Would you 
like to stay with us until your house is rebuilt, Miss Murakumo?&quot; 

This time, Chikane was unable to hold back her tears. &quot;Thank you, Sir!&quot; 
she cried, bowing her head. &quot;Thank you.&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;ll be happy to accommodate you, Miss Murakumo,&quot; said Rika with a 
smile. 

&quot;Otoha,&quot; said Takeshi, &quot;please make arrangements for Miss Murakumo to 
stay in the guest bedroom.&quot; 

&quot;Yes Sir,&quot; said Otoha, &quot;right away.&quot; The maid exited the conference 
room, taking the serving cart with her. 

Otoha realized that she was more enthusiastic than she had anticipated. 
&#39;Miss Murakumo staying here?&#39; Otoha thought to herself. &#39;When she called 
me &quot;Otoha&quot; it felt so familiar and it was hard for me to breathe. What 
is this feeling?&#39; 

---------- 

Back in the conference room, the four stood up. &quot;Thank you again for 
letting me stay here in your home,&quot; said Chikane. &quot;It means a lot to 
me.&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;ll show you around the house,&quot; Takeshi said. 

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s fine,&quot; said Chikane. &quot;I think I can find my way around 
myself.&quot; 

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; asked Rika. 

&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Chikane reassured. &quot;You&#39;ve done enough for me already.&quot; 

&quot;Very well, Miss Murakumo.&quot; 

&quot;Please, call me Chikane.&quot; 

&quot;Of course...Chikane.&quot; 

Her mother had called her &quot;Chikane&quot;. To have her parents call her 
&quot;Chikane&quot; again was more happiness than she could bear and the tears 
threatened to burst forth again. Before she completely broke down, 
Chikane managed to choke out, &quot;Thank you very much,&quot; and then left the 
room, trying her best not to act rushed. 

&quot;Thank you, Mister and Missus Himemiya,&quot; said Himeko, leaving after 
Chikane. When he exited the conference room, Himeko saw Chikane running 
down the hall. &quot;Chikane,&quot; she called, &quot;wait for me.&quot; She ran after 
Chikane, trying her best to keep up. 

---------- 

Otoha was just finishing making sure that the guest bedroom was suited 
for Chikane to sleep in when she saw Chikane running down the hall 
toward her. Seeing Otoha, Chikane tried her best to regain her 
composure. She walked as calmly as she could toward the bedroom, Otoha 
waiting patiently by the door. 

&quot;Uh, the bedroom is prepared, Miss Murakumo,&quot; Otoha said, concerned 
about Chikane. 

&quot;Thank you, Otoha,&quot; said Chikane as she entered. 

Otoha could not help but watch as Chikane closed the door behind her. 
&#39;That same feeling again,&#39; she thought to herself. 

At that moment, Himeko came down the hall as well. &quot;Otoha,&quot; she asked, 
seeing the main standing before her, &quot;did Chikane come by here?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, Miss,&quot; replied Otoha. &quot;She just entered this room.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Himeko opened the door and stepped inside. Otoha&#39;s mind 
raced with inexplicable feelings of compassion for Chikane, as well as 
feelings for Himeko that bordered on jealousy. What was confusing to her 
was why she had developed these feelings so quickly toward two people 
that she had just met. 

---------- 

As Himeko entered the room, she found Chikane sitting on the bed. She 
was sobbing uncontrollably, but the expression on her face was not one 
of sadness. The expression on Chikane&#39;s face could only be described as 
one of bliss. &quot;Chikane?&quot; said Himeko, sitting down next to her beloved. 

&quot;Oh, Himeko!&quot; Chikane cried, leaping toward Himeko and embracing the 
shorter girl. &quot;I&#39;m back!&quot; she cried. &quot;I&#39;m finally back!&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m so happy, Chikane,&quot; said Himeko, stroking Chikane&#39;s head as the 
taller girl sobbed into Himeko&#39;s chest. Himeko knew that Chikane&#39;s tears 
were probably going to stain her blue pullover, but she did not care. 
She just wanted to be with Chikane, to hold her and let her know how 
much she loved her. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; said Chikane, lifted her face to look at Himeko. &quot;I just 
couldn&#39;t control myself, the tears just started coming. Hearing my 
mother call me &#39;Chikane&#39; after all this time, I was just so happy. I 
didn&#39;t think that I would be able to rebuild my life after it was taken 
away from me.&quot; Chikane&#39;s smile had suddenly disappeared. 

&quot;Chikane?&quot; asked Himeko, noticing Chikane&#39;s discomfort. 

&quot;Himeko, she took everything from me,&quot; said Chikane, the happiness in 
her voice replaced by sadness. &quot;My happiness, my family, my friends, 
everything that ever mattered to me.&quot; Chikane started sobbing again. 
This time, her tears were those of sadness. &quot;Ame no Murakumo took you 
away from me and locked me in complete darkness for almost a year. You 
don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like, not being able to see or hear or smell or 
taste or touch anything. Being surrounded by complete nothingness. It&#39;s 
frightening. It&#39;s as if the entire universe just ceased to exist.&quot; There 
was a pause. Chikane then said, &quot;Himeko, what if what happened last year 
happens again? What if we really can&#39;t escape our fate? What if we&#39;re 
torn from each other&#39;s arms again? I can&#39;t bear to be without you.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t blame Ame no Murakumo,&quot; said Himeko. &quot;It&#39;s not her fault. If 
Orochi didn&#39;t destroy the world, then the life of a priestess wouldn&#39;t 
be needed to remake it. If we can defeat Orochi before he destroys the 
world, then we can finally free ourselves from this cycle. And the only 
way to defeat Orochi before the world is destroyed is if we revive Ame 
no Murakumo before Orochi has a chance.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re right, Himeko,&quot; said Chikane, the smile returning to her face. 
&quot;First thing tomorrow, we&#39;ll go to the Ogami Shrine and begin the 
revival ceremony. And I promise I won&#39;t hold back this time! I won&#39;t let 
the Orochi consume my heart!&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m so happy to hear you say that,&quot; Himeko said, taking Chikane in her 
arms again. 

Just then, the Solar Mark on Himeko&#39;s chest lit up and she was overcome 
with an ominous feeling. &quot;Himeko?&quot; Chikane asked, seeing Himeko&#39;s 
expression change. 

&quot;Something&#39;s wrong,&quot; Himeko said. Just then, her face turned to complete 
horror. &quot;It&#39;s an Orochi! Oh no! Mako!&quot; 

&quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot; Chikane grabbed Himeko&#39;s wrist, rushed to the window, threw 
the window open, and jumped out with Himeko in tow. The Lunar Mark on 
Chikane&#39;s back lit up and the swirling, yellow walls of Tsukuyomi no 
Mikoto formed around them. Chikane sent her other self as fast as it 
could toward Ototachibana Academy, where the next Orochi attack was 
about to take place. 

---------- 

OMAKE: 

Chikane walked as calmly as she could toward the bedroom, Otoha waiting 
patiently by the door. 

&quot;The bedroom is prepared, Miss Murakumo,&quot; Otoha said. 

&quot;Thank you, Otoha,&quot; said Chikane as she entered. 

Otoha entered the room and locked the door. &quot;Finally, I have you all to 
myself!&quot; said the maid with a devious grin on her face. She pounced on 
Chikane, pinned her to the bed, and they had hot lesbian sex all night 
long.
