<h1>Both Ways, Chikane</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kannazuki/index.html">Kannazuki no Miko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/astha.html">asthalanthil</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	The confrontation with Orochi was near. He had 
trained and prepared all his life to meet the coming 
threat and he knew. He felt it in his very bones that the 
event was just around the corner. And as always, when he 
thought of Orochi, he thought of his charges. Of how 
heavy the burden was on their slender shoulders. 

	He could never quite forgive himself for being the 
one to wrench them out of their lives. For being the one 
that told them that they were to sacrifice all they were 
for the good of the world. Give up your lives, he had 
said. And both of them had willingly followed. Had he 
left them alone, he knew they would have accomplished 
great things, lead happy lives. They were special, his 
girls. And that was what had doomed them to this fate.

	Oogami turned the corner and paused. A shadowy 
figure stood at the far end of the corridor. Another pang 
of melancholy seized him. Fate found new ways to be cruel 
all the time.

	He turned and resumed his walk, breathing in the 
clean, cold air of the night as a balm against the 
regret.

			*****

	Katsura Dai breathed a sigh of relief. Oogami-sensei 
had come upon her a few times now but he had never said 
anything. She briefly wondered why he had never spoken to 
her about her skulking about at night but shrugged. If he 
let it pass, then she should be glad.

	She leaned her face against the door, wishing she 
had the courage to open it and walk in. 

	Tonight, for some reason, thought became action and 
before Dai knew what she was doing, she had slid the 
aside and stepped inside the room. And inside the room 
lay her friend, asleep. Her blonde hair was in disarray 
and her mouth was slightly open. 

	Dai had never seen a sweeter sight.

	Heart beating wildly, she stole to her friend&#39;s 
side. A blonde tendril lay astray across Michiko&#39;s eyes. 
She stared at it awhile and unbidden, a smile came to her 
lips. With infinite gentleness, she brushed the tendril 
aside and tucked it behind her friend&#39;s ear.

	True to form, her friend remained dead to world. A 
strange feeling came over her heart as she gazed at 
Michiko and Dai just barely managed to keep herself from 
gasping. It had hurt but at the same time, it had given 
her a feeling of joy. To be able to look at her like 
this, without having to avert her eyes. Without letting 
too much of the affection she felt into her eyes. But 
without seeing her friend&#39;s violet&#39;s eyes gazing back at 
her in return.

	Unbidden, a desire came upon her to find out how 
soft Michiko&#39;s lips were. Again, her body worked faster 
than her mind did because she found herself on her knees, 
her face close to her sleeping friend. 

	This is madness, Dai told herself. It was a madness 
that came upon her every time she came near or even 
thought of Michiko. But she could not stop herself. She 
felt Michiko&#39;s breath on her face, breathed in the clean, 
soft smell that was Michiko. All thought stopped and her 
lips descended upon her friend.

	Only to stop a millimeter away. Michiko did not 
deserve this. She deserved a heartfelt declaration of 
love; sincerity and resoluteness. Not this stolen 
midnight kiss. She deserved someone who could give her a 
future, give her the children she sometimes spoke about. 
Not Dai, who could give her neither.

	Her duty as the Lunar Priestess. The responsibility 
she had to the world. There could be no hapiness for her, 
there was no time for her to be happy. Her duty to 
Michiko. Her friend adored her so much; she could not do 
this to her, saddling her with the perverted affections 
of someone with  whom she only felt sisterhood.

	She stood up and without a backward glance, walked 
out of the room and closed the door.

			*****

	The Lunar Priestess had always been quiet but today 
she was unusually withdrawn. As soon as Oogami-sensei 
released them from their morning lessons, Michiko ran 
over to her friend and clasped her hand.

	Dai&#39;s gaze was stormy and turbulent but the 
gentleness that came into it as soon as Michiko came into 
her sight made the blonde&#39;s heart jump a little. Hastily, 
she squashed down the jittery feeling she had always had 
around her tall partner.

	&quot;Dai-chan?&quot;

	The Lunar Priestess tilted her head slightly in 
response.

	&quot;Why are you so quiet today? I mean- &quot; Michiko said, 
not wanting to aggravate her friend further.

	An even softer look from the other girl. Michiko 
felt a flush start from her cheeks and go all the way up 
to the roots of her hair as her heart started palpitating 
even more.

	&quot;Uh... I think I need to talk to Oogami-sensei about 
something. Talk to you later!&quot;

	She fled, feeling like an utter fool. Her friend was 
so beautiful and composed that Michiko felt clumsy and 
graceless beside her. Dai also had a very kind heart 
behind the icy exterior and that made Michiko adore her 
even more.

	The dream she had last night rose up in her mind. 
Dai walking into her room, with a look full of love and 
something else. Dai leaning over her. Dai pressing her 
lips to hers. A sob started to push its way from her 
throat. Beautiful, noble Dai would never want her and 
Michiko was insulting her friend just by thinking of her 
in a weird way.

	She started running to the field.


			*****

	That tore it, Dai thought glumly. She had not been 
hiding it well. So much so that Michiko saw the need to 
run away from her.  Her first instinct was to go to her 
room and cry but she squashed it. Taking a deep breath, 
she got up and walked to the front doors of the shrine. 

	It was a fine day outside. It was the opposite of 
what she was feeling. She wished that it were a stormy 
day instead, that she could at least find a perverse sort 
of comfort in the lightning and thunder.

	She sensed, rather than heard a presence behind her.

	&quot;Oogami-sensei.&quot;

	&quot;I spoke to you about duty. I spoke to you about 
responsibility.&quot;

She turned around and looked at him. His face was 
composed and grave, as always.

	&quot;And you, more than Michiko, understand duty and 
responsibility. It is in your blood. She does not shirk 
it but you were brought up for it, unlike her. She has 
had a carefree and happy life.&quot;

	Born of a ruling family, Katsura Dai, scion of an 
ancient line. It was true. She knew the utter 
mercilessness of  duty. And she had been perfectly bred 
to carry it out.

	&quot;I have never spoken of this but I care for the both 
of you.&quot;

	Nothing in her expression changed but he had always 
been able to read her more than other people could.

	&quot;You are surprised that I speak of this, yet you 
have always known. You have always been perspective, 
except perhaps in certain matters.&quot;

	She continued looking at him stoically.

	&quot;I will speak no more except to tell you this. Duty 
is not always a shackle. Remember Katsura Jiro.&quot;

	A faint smile flicked across his face before he 
left, leaving a slightly stunned and thoughtful Dai.

	Katsura Jiro?

			*****

	The lush green fields had always given her a sense 
of calm and she was sorely disappointed when today, they 
failed to do their duty. Michiko plopped herself down to 
the grass and curled up, feeling as if she wanted to 
burst into tears. That had not gone too well. 

	Taking deep breaths, che forced herself to calm 
down. She adored Dai so much and it seemed that adoration 
was becoming a source of embarassment to them both. 
Miserably, she wondered if she should perhaps keep away 
from Dai. At that thought, a sharp stab of pain went 
through her. Keeping away from Dai; that thought was 
worse than losing an arm or a leg.

	Eyes closed and lost in misery, she failed to notice 
the slight rustling of the grass denoting the presence of 
someone else. A hand closed on her forearm.

	She jerked and screamed, in her blind panic fearing 
an assasination by the Orochi.

	&quot;Eeeeeeeyeh!&quot;

&quot;Michiko,&quot; said the voice dearest to her, cutting 
through the panic.

	A sense of mortification flooded her as she saw that 
it was Dai.

	&quot;Dai-chan,&quot; she said in a small voice and started to 
get up. Her friend&#39;s hand gently kept her down and 
pausing, she acquiesced.

	She heard Dai lying down beside her but she did not 
turn towards her. She looked at the blue sky overhead. 

	&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Michiko?&quot; Dai asked in a gentle 
voice.

	Thankfully, she managed to keep a quaver from 
appearing in her voice.

	&quot;Dai-chan, I want these days to never end.&quot;

	Dai&#39;s hand gently touched her cheek and caressed it. 
A thrill shot through Michiko and and she turned, to see 
Dai&#39;s beautiful face upside-down from her point of view. 
Her friend had lain down the opposite direction from her 
but her face was directly across Michiko&#39;s own.

	She could have sworn she heard a gulp from Dai but 
that was impossible. Dai never got nervous about 
anything.

	&quot;Michiko?&quot;

	&quot;Yes?&quot;

	&quot;Have I, have I ever told you about Katsura Jiro?&quot;

	Her melancholy abated somewhat and she looked at Dai 
with interest. Dai was definitely nervous.

	&quot;No, Dai-chan. Wasn&#39;t he some kind of hero years 
ago? Wait a minute. Katsura? Is he related to you?&quot;

	&quot;Well, ah, he was what you would call a hero and 
yes, he&#39;s my grand-uncle but my family threw him out.&quot;

	She considered Dai&#39;s face carefully. She seemed to 
be skirting an unpleasant topic.

	&quot;Why, if he&#39;s a hero?&quot;

	&quot;Well. Well. He was like the black sheep. Everything 
he did was contrary to what the family believed in. He 
wanted to marry this peasant girl who was already 
pregnant by another man.&quot;

	Michiko gasped loudly. She knew that the ancient and 
noble Katsura clan would have likely disowned him.

	&quot;But he didn&#39;t care. I think he loved her a lot. He 
simply rode out with all his gear and went off before 
they could disown him. And the thing is, my grandmother 
said that he didn&#39;t even know that she loved him back but 
he just felt that he had to do it.&quot;

	The Solar Priestess sighed, happy at such a romantic 
turn.

	&quot;Then, during the Ten Years war, as most people 
know, he was the one that managed to turn the tide of the 
war in favour of our country. They would have made him 
shogun but again, he simply rode out and went away with 
his family.&quot;

	Michiko&#39;s eyebrows raised up to her hairline. &quot;That 
is amazing, Dai-chan. What do you feel about it?&quot;

	There was no doubt about it. Dai had definitely 
gulped. 

	&quot;Well. Well. Uh, you know that the Katsura clan 
values devotion to duty above all other. They speak of 
him as having abandoned his responsibilities and 
ultimately disgracing what we stand for.&quot;

	&quot;Dai-chan?&quot;

	&quot;Uh, my opinion. My opinion is that he did what he 
had to do, both ways.&quot;

	&quot;Both ways?&quot;

	&quot;What was required of him. What he wanted...&quot; Dai
said softly.

	Michiko considered that for a moment and nodded.

	&quot;So Dai-chan, you came here to tell me that story?&quot; 
she asked innocently.

	To her surprise, Dai blushed right to the roots of 
her hair, suddenly sending Michiko&#39;s heart pumping. There 
was something afoot. Dai was about to tell her something.

	&quot;Michiko. I&#39;m sorry. I did not come here to tell you 
Katsura Jiro&#39;s story. I came here because I&#39;ve decided 
something. That I have to do what I have to do. Both 
ways.&quot;

	Dai&#39;s face came closer, so close that Michiko could 
feel her breath. Her dark blue eyes were sparkling with 
some emotion so intense, it made Michiko feel giddy. Dai 
was so close, so close that she could-

	Dai meant to kiss her. 

	A silent question in Dai&#39;s eyes. Michiko said yes 
with all her heart.

			*****

	Chikane paused at the door to Himeko&#39;s room. Each 
night it was a torment. Each night she wanted to go in , 
to seek an outlet with for her feelings. Some nights she 
managed to go in. And when she went in, there was another 
battle to be fought. Some nights she simply walked away. 

	Today, she stood there, suffering silently. Thinking 
about dreams where the two of them lay on a lush field 
and kissed. Thinking about the reality of Souma and 
Himeko. Thinking about duty and responsibility.

Tonight, she walked away.
