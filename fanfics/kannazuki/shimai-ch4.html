<p>Chikane  and Reverend Ohgami quickly brought Marika up to speed with what was  happening.</p>
<p>&quot;Geez,  this is so completely unfair,&quot; she declared. &quot;Here you  are, ready and willing to revive Ame no Murakumo and save the world,  and someone goes and swipes the Solar Priestess job from Hikari.&quot;</p>
<p>Four  pairs of surprised eyes greeted her summary of events.</p>
<p>&quot;Um,  what did I say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  hadn't thought of that,&quot; Reverend Ohgami mused.</p>
<p>&quot;Do  you think it's possible?&quot; Chikane asked excitedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Again,  completely lost here,&quot; interjected Marika.</p>
<p>&quot;We  had been thinking,&quot; her father said, &quot;of the problem in  terms of finding the Solar Priestess, wherever she may be. But as  you have alluded to, perhaps that is <em>not</em> what is happening. It seems, after all, quite odd that Hikari would  possess the memories of a previous life as Solar Priestess but not  the role itself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ahh,&quot;  Professor Ohgami chimed in. &quot;So you suspect that Hikari still  is the Solar Priestess and that someone--probably one of the  Orochi--is deliberately preventing her from assuming the part? That  in this way the role has been 'swiped' from her like Marika said?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It  makes sense,&quot; Chikane said eagerly. &quot;Without the Solar  Priestess, the power of Orochi cannot be defeated. They would surely  seek out a way to stop her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then  why don't I even have the mark?&quot; Himeko asked. &quot;That  appears at the beginning of the day, not when we awaken as  priestesses. Wouldn't I have seen it when I got dressed?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You  might not,&quot; Chikane mused, &quot;if you were asleep when it  happened.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  thought it over, then surprised herself by spotting a flaw in the  logic.</p>
<p>&quot;But  if they knew who I was, and they wanted to seal away my status as the  Solar Priestess, then why wouldn't they just kill me instead? That  would be more effective for the Orochi, and I'd think it would be a  lot easier.&quot;</p>
<p>She  looked from one face to another, finishing with Chikane. Her twin  had a serious expression and a slight frown.</p>
<p>&quot;What  you say makes sense, Himeko,&quot; she said. &quot;I have to admit,  I wish it didn't.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because  it would mean that there wasn't someone else out there, some Solar  Priestess other than you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let's  not take that off the table just yet,&quot; interjected Professor  Ohgami. &quot;After all, who says that these Orochi necessarily  function in sane and rational ways--or that they don't have some  other clever scheme afoot that we don't know about?&quot;</p>
<p>Both  sisters had turned back to her, slightly embarrassed that they'd just  missed breaking into a romantic moment in front of other people.</p>
<p>&quot;In  any case, we have the beginnings of a plan of action,&quot; the  professor continued. &quot;Takeshi and I are going to hit the books. In the meantime, the two of you need to prepare yourselves for  whatever the Orochi might do next, particularly you, Tsukuyo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If  what happened at school is any example of what's coming, they need to  find a really deep hole and hide in it!&quot; Marika said. &quot;The  story said six people were killed and over thirty injured!&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;What  story?&quot; asked Reverend Ohgami.</p>
<p>&quot;I  checked it out on my cell's 'net browser on the way over,&quot; she  explained. &quot;I can still barely wrap my head around the idea of  Reiko Himemiya being a crazed magical killer. I guess it really is  the quiet ones who snap.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  agree with Marika,&quot; said Chikane. &quot;We need to find out  some way to fight back, and until we do we can't go around making  ourselves into targets.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  Chikane, we can't do that! Think of everyone!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If...if  Reiko is an Orochi, then they know all about us, not just as  priestesses but as people. Our names, where we live, what classes we  take, the names of our friends, all of it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's  what makes things so dangerous for us,&quot; Chikane agreed. &quot;Until  we find the Solar Priestess...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No!  That's not what I'm talking about! We have to go back <em>because</em> Reiko  knows all that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko,  you're not making any sense.&quot; Chikane glanced to the Ohgamis,  to see if they had any ideas, but they appeared to be equally  confused.</p>
<p>Himeko  sighed. She supposed she wasn't being very clear, at that.</p>
<p>&quot;What's  going to happen if Reiko or another Orochi attacks the college  looking for us and we're not there? What'll they do? Six people were  killed this time, so how many would it be next time? Ten? Twenty? A  hundred? Don't you see, we have to be there to protect people, to  keep them from being hurt or worse for our sakes!&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  looked at her for a long moment, then turned to Reverend Ohgami.</p>
<p>&quot;Would  you please excuse us for a moment?&quot; she asked, then rose to her  feet, drawing Himeko up by the hand that she'd never gotten around to  releasing.</p>
<p>&quot;Of  course.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  took Himeko to the inner door, slid the screen open, then closed it  again when they were out in the hall. She then led Himeko a short  way down the corridor so that their voices would not be instantly  audible through the wood-and-paper <em>shoji </em>screens. She had that peculiar tightness in her face that Himeko knew meant  Chikane was angry at her. Chikane always had trouble with that  emotion because she still felt all kinds of silly misplaced guilt  over what she'd put Himeko through in their past lives. Himeko  wished she would stop that, but when her Chikane was angry at her  wasn't the easiest time to tell her that she didn't need to be guilty  and should just come out and yell--Himeko wasn't <em>that</em> brave!</p>
<p>She  reached out and set her hands on Himeko's shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko,  I know you were just trying to protect people's lives, but that isn't  going to be possible. The Orochi are much more powerful than I--than  we are, and there are eight of them. We don't have a Souma Ohgami  among their number willing to turn to our side and hold the line  until we can summon Ame no Murakumo. We don't even have both  priestesses. There's no way we can protect everyone, Himeko. We can  barely even protect ourselves, and that isn't certain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  people were killed! You can't think that's all right.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  sighed.</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko...Reiko  didn't kill those people. I'm the one responsible for their deaths.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Wh-what  is she talking about? She can't mean that!</em></p>
<p>&quot;I  told  you that I escaped her by putting up barriers, didn't I?  Trapping Reiko inside them so that I could run away? Well, it wasn't  just Reiko that was trapped. That building was in use. There were  students coming and going from class, there were professors and  teaching assistants, and there were probably general staff members. I  sealed them, helpless, inside an enclosed area with an incarnate  force of destruction. More than likely they were killed as  collateral damage when Reiko broke open those barriers; if she had  wanted to lash out and kill more there would certainly have been more  casualties.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane,  that's not the same thing. You couldn't have thought about that when  you were doing it.&quot;</p>
<p>She  shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;No,  I didn't. But if I had I would have done it anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;  Himeko gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko...you're  talking  about protecting people's lives, but those lives are lost  anyway. There are only two possible outcomes for all of this. Either  Yamata no Orochi will win and destruction will encompass the  earth forever, or we will win, we and Ame no Murakumo. If that  happens, time itself will be unwound and recreated, and the souls of  those killed will be restored to life at the start of this  morning--probably <em>better</em> lives  since the malice that gave rise to Orochi will have been temporarily  suppressed. But here and now, in this time, those people will die. It's inescapable.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  gasped again; Chikane's words were like a slap across her face.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane,  I...I can't believe you're saying these things! You can't be saying  that people's lives don't matter!&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  sighed again and let her hands drop.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,  Himeko,&quot; she said, shaking her head sadly. &quot;Of course I'm  saying that. Don't you remember that in our previous lives, I was  the final Orochi? That in the last cycle I destroyed the world with  my own will in order to bring things to the endgame? Every single  person then alive--six <em>billion</em> people, including my own family, the Ohgamis, dear loyal Otoha, your  best friend Makoto, and even Souma? I did that fully expecting you to  kill me and revive the world--as the world <em>was</em> revived--but  I did it nonetheless, because it was a necessary step towards  Orochi's defeat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But...but...&quot;  Himeko whimpered. Chikane's voice was so calm, even gentle as it  said such horrible things; that was the worst of it. It shouldn't be  possible to say that kind of thing without some overwhelming emotion,  but not this way, not <em>lovingly</em>. Himeko found herself tearing up as her mind reached for the only  explanation that made sense to her. &quot;But you were Orochi then,  and you were suffering from guilt and despair because I couldn't make  my feelings clear. So that's...that's why...&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  suddenly embraced her, pulling her lover against her, cradling  Himeko's head against her shoulder and gently stroking her hair like  she would to comfort a child.</p>
<p>&quot;I  wish that were true, but it isn't. My foolishness in mistrusting  you, in not believing you could love me in the way I love you was the  reason I hurt you, and why my soul fell to become one of the Orochi,  but as for the people of the world...&quot; She sighed again. &quot;No,  that was done with clear eyes, unclouded by doubts. It is  inevitable, Himeko. Orochi must be unleashed for Orochi to be  defeated and sealed. So long as the wills of the Necks contain the  power of the serpent god, then the final battle cannot be fought.&quot;</p>
<p>She  sighed yet again, and continued to tenderly cradle Himeko against  her.</p>
<p>&quot;I  believe that in the past, before I lost my way, we would summon Ame  no Murakumo as soon as we awoke as priestesses. One by one we would  throw down the Necks who sought to wield the power of destruction,  and when the last was defeated, Yamata no Orochi itself would be  released. We would strike it down as well, but such forces could not  be unleashed without grave destruction. Therefore we would revive  the world and remake time itself to erase what had happened.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But,  Chikane...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  know it hurts, Himeko, but we cannot protect anyone by guarding their  lives in this world. The only way we can save them is to make  certain that we defeat the Orochi and give the people their new  world. What happens to them here, only we and the gods will  remember.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  can't do it,&quot; she sniffled. &quot;I can't just watch people  die. I can't say to the Ohgamis that I would protect my life at  their own expense. Or Marika. And what about Mama and Papa? You  couldn't really let them die if you could stop it, could you?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  cradled her gently.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,  Himeko, I could. There's only one person for whose sake I would do  something so shortsighted and foolhardy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane...&quot;</p>
<p>The  Lunar Priestess twined a stray lock of Himeko's hair around her index  finger.</p>
<p>&quot;You  really couldn't, though, could you? Even knowing what is to come, you  couldn't just step aside and let events take their course without  trying your hardest to stop them.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  shook her head. She felt embarrassed and upset, almost ashamed;  Chikane's manner was almost that of a mother acquainting her child  with a difficult truth instead of being the way sisters or lovers  would discuss things. Himeko hated when she felt this way; a child  was a burden on the parent--albeit one borne with love--because it  wasn't capable of bearing its own weight and Himeko hated, hated,  hated being a burden of any kind on Chikane.</p>
<p>But  she couldn't change her feelings, either, and one of the most  important promises they'd made to one another was that they wouldn't  hide what they thought or felt any more.</p>
<p>&quot;No,  I couldn't. I see what you're saying, Chikane, I really do, but it's  wrong to just stand by and let others get hurt in our place. It's  probably smart, but it isn't right.&quot;</p>
<p>She  looked up at Chikane and found to her surprise that her beloved's  eyes were wet.</p>
<p>&quot;You  shame me, Himeko, you truly do,&quot; she said, and gently brushed  the back of her hand against Himeko's cheek. The feathery touch made  Himeko shiver all the way down to her toes.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's  all right, my love. We'll do what we can for everyone.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  felt her heart leap.</p>
<p>&quot;You  mean that you agree with me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,  but I don't care enough about the distinction to make you unhappy  over it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh...&quot; Himeko wasn't quite sure how she felt about that. It sounded a  little bit like emotional blackmail, with her as the blackmailer. Honesty between lovers wasn't supposed to work that way. &quot;Then  you're doing this for my sake?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  seemed to take great care in choosing her words, clearly aware of the  direction of Himeko's thoughts.</p>
<p>&quot;Not  for your sake, exactly. It's more that you reminded me of what the  right thing to do would be.&quot; She smiled gently and kissed  Himeko softly on the forehead, her lips like the brush of a bird's  wing against Himeko's skin. &quot;The moon shines while wrapped in  darkness, so it is not unnatural that it may sometimes lose sight of  the light.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  glad. I didn't want to think I was bullying you into something.&quot;</p>
<p>Her  lover chuckled.</p>
<p>&quot;Who  would ever believe you capable of being a bully?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not  with shouting or fists, but there are other kinds of bullying. And...you do let me have my way an awful lot of the time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So  do gods, so at least I'm in good company.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane!&quot;  she protested, but her twin just laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;I  did think of a practical reason to do as you act, by the way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right  now, our best hope is that the Ohgamis discover something in their  archive research that lets us find out what happened to the role of  Solar Priestess. If we stay here, sooner or later the Orochi will  find us. Laying aside the merely mystical connection between the  shrine and the priestesses, Marika is your best friend. That makes  this a logical place to hunt for you. In a battle here, the Orochi  might destroy the shrine archives. It's a dangerous game to play,  using ourselves as bait, but there is something to be gained by it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  glad,&quot; Himeko said, smiling brightly.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's  go tell the others, then.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>The  next  day was bright and sunny, a crisp October day where the air had  just a hint of winter's bite to it but not enough to require a coat. It  was hard to believe that something as awful as the Orochi was  abroad on a day like this one, Himeko thought. The path she and  Marika followed ran along the edge of the hill and she could see the  Ototachibana students scurrying up and down the stairs. The girls'  brown skirts and double-breasted jackets at this distance reminded  her of fallen leaves, crisped and sere, being blown on the autumn  wind. She paused and framed the shot, wishing she'd brought her  camera.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?  What'cha doing?&quot; Marika asked, so Himeko told her.</p>
<p>&quot;I  could call it '<em>Leaves  in the Wind of Learning</em>,'  or something like that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It  might be good. Still, give me the summer unis any day. Bright red  and white is way more my style than brown, and the tights make my  legs look good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They  used to wear them year-round; you'd have liked that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They  did? How do you--ohhh, the past-life memories thing. You know, it  was weird enough when that was all kind of a romantic story, but now  that I know it's the plain truth...&quot; She shook her head. &quot;Of  course, it means that Dad gets the last laugh on Aunt Minako. It's  hard to be an atheist when you're helping resurrected shrine maidens  summon a god to fight another god!&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  giggled.</p>
<p>&quot;She's  really taking it well, though.&quot;</p>
<p>Marika  shrugged.</p>
<p>&quot;The  scientific method really is her deity of choice. She'd probably say  that a good scientist has no business getting emotionally attached to  a particular theory but should just follow where the evidence leads.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That  does sound like something Professor Ohgami would say.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,  I ought to know her by now; she moved back in with us when my mother  died. Since I was only three, she pretty much was all the mother  I've had.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're  lucky she was there. You never know what you'll be getting when  you're in someone else's care.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot;  Marika said, then stopped. &quot;Wait a sec--what do you know about  it? Your mom and dad are still alive!&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  smiled sadly.</p>
<p>&quot;I  know. I say a prayer of thanks for that every night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then  how--oh, not again,&quot; Marika sighed, realizing that her  experience was Himeko Kurusugawa's, not Hikari Asamiya's. &quot;Was  it terribly awful?&quot; her friend asked, more gently.</p>
<p>&quot;My  parents died when I was five. I was given to the care of relatives,  but they...weren't suited to raise a child. So the government put me  into foster care; my guardians weren't bad people but we weren't  close, either.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Geez,  Hikari, I'm sorry to dredge up painful memories.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  quickly shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Mm-mm. It's okay. You're my best friend; I can trust you with stuff like  this. And besides, I have a wonderful family now, with a mother and  father who love men and I've gotten to be with Chikane right from the  day I was born! So I don't have any regrets!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're  really something else, you know that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>
<p>Marika  grinned.</p>
<p>&quot;Never  mind. Hey, just out of curiosity, how long ago was it, anyway? Your  past life, I mean.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  not really sure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hikari,  that didn't even make sense.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  know,&quot; she groaned. &quot;I didn't get it either. Every time  Chikane tries to explain it, I get a headache.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Give  it your best shot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,  it's because of what happens to <em>time</em>,  she says. It isn't just that Orochi gets defeated and the world gets  put back where it was, but it's a <em>different</em> world,  where things happened that didn't happen or things didn't happen that  did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like  in a parallel universe?&quot; asked Marika, who was a sci-fi fan.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!  Maybe...I don't know. It's like...the Mahoroba we're living in now  is really similar to the Mahoroba from my last life, but they might  be five years or five hundred years apart.&quot; Himeko shook her  head as if to loosen the fuzzies that seemed to have taken over. &quot;I  really, really don't understand how it works. You should ask  Chikane.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It  would probably give me a headache, too.&quot;</p>
<p>They  were nearing the dorm, now; in a minute Marika would turn left  towards the stairs to catch the bus back to the shrine.</p>
<p>&quot;Say,  Hikari...do you want to do something tonight? I mean, you and Tsukuyo  kind of missed your entire birthday celebration thanks to those idiot  Orochi.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'd  like to, but...we were going to spend it together. We never got to  exchange gifts and we were so tired after we got back home yesterday  night that we just went straight to sleep, and then it was off to  class again this morning...&quot;</p>
<p>Marika  laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey,  it's okay. One excuse was enough.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,  really, we did have plans.&quot;</p>
<p>She  reached up and ruffled Himeko's hair.</p>
<p>&quot;I  know. I'm just saying that being with your girlfriend is good enough  reason. I'm so jealous of you, though.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  you don't even like girls that way, Marika.&quot;</p>
<p>Marika  groaned.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,  geez, I just meant that--&quot; She looked up into Himeko's grin. &quot;Argh, you got me that time. I usually forget that you <em>have</em> a  sense of humor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Am  I really that bad?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,  but Tall, Dark, and Princessy is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Actually,  you'd be surprised. Chikane really has a very sly sense of humor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're  right. I would be surprised.&quot;</p>
<p>Both  girls dissolved into giggles.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey,  would you like to come up for a while?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Won't  I be in the way?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,  Chikane has that late world history class on Tuesdays so she won't be  back yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All  right, then. It'll be more fun to hang out with you,&quot; Marika  said brightly.</p>
<p>Himeko  led the way up the stairs to her dorm room, past other students who  milled around, going in and out of their rooms on their own business.</p>
<p>&quot;Now,&quot;  Marika said as Himeko put her key in the lock, &quot;you're sure this  will be okay, right? After all, I'm about to step into the&quot;--she  stood up on tiptoe so she could whisper the rest of it in Himeko's  ear--&quot;love nest of two notorious perverts!&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  flushed.</p>
<p>&quot;Geez,  Marika, if you're going to be <em>that</em> way about it, why do you even hang out with me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa!  I'm sorry; I was just giving you a hard time about it like always. I  didn't mean anything bad by it, honestly. It's fun to tease you, but  I've honestly thought the whole forbidden love thing was kind of  sweet. I don't know what that says about me,&quot; she added with an  attempt at a grin, &quot;but I really am glad you have someone who  loves you that much. When I'm not jealous as heck, that is.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  let out her breath and her anger together.</p>
<p>&quot;No,  I'm sorry too,&quot; she said. &quot;I know the difference between  your teasing and real feelings. I'm...just worried, what with all  that's happened. But I'm really lucky to have a friend like you,  who's on my side.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um,  so we're okay, then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of  course!&quot;</p>
<p>She  turned the key in the lock and opened the door. Himeko gasped as she  saw the long, lean form seated in Chikane's desk chair, a pale woman  in her mid-twenties with short, silvery-blue hair.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome  home, Solar Priestess.&quot;</p>
