text-indent:31.5pt'>Oota Reiko looked up as she heard the Fourth HeadÅfs voice.
In spite of herself and her knowledge of the latterÅfs dressing habit, she stared.
Korona, as always, wore revealing clothes barely more decent than a transparent
sheet. Reiko understood that it was the trend of pop idols these days but
whatever they did in those music videos and recording studios, should they not
have a little more shame in public? If someone paid enough attention, they
would see without much difficulty what kind of... delicate clothes the girl was
wearing beneath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>Reiko shook her head slightly in frustration. She was
willing to bet that Korona had caused several accidents just by <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>walking</span></i> on the streets,
especially if the girl had been swaying those hips of hers in front of the
terrible drivers of Downtown the way she always did even when no one was
watching. Had Korona not been an Orochi, someone would have molested her in
some dark alley long since.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgI never thought IÅfd sense the presence of an Orochi in a
Catholic churchyard, let alone one offering camellia flowers to a grave,Åh the
Fourth Head commented casually, seemingly oblivious of the indecency of her
outfit. ÅgWhose is it? DonÅft suppose it belongs to one of your victims.Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgIt is NatsuneÅfs,Åh Reiko answered quietly and fixed her
eyes back on the marble tombstone. ÅgToday is the fifth anniversary of her
passing.Åh Her reply seemed to have hit the Fourth Head square between her eyes.
Grimacing, the girl chewed on her lower lip, appearing ashamed and deathly
embarrassed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgI... didnÅft know that. IÅfm sorry, Reiko,Åh Korona said
after a while, voice strangely quiet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgI do not mind, Fourth Head. It is not like you did that on
purpose.Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>Korona walked in front of the grave and offered Natsune a
solemn bow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgThank you, Fourth Head.Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅgOota
Natsune, the only one I love, may you rest in peace within the embrace of the
earth,Åh</span></i> as though she did not hear what Reiko said, Korona read the
words engraved on the tombstone, her eyes widening slightly when they set upon
NatsuneÅfs name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgOota? IsnÅft that your last...?Åh KoronaÅfs voice trailed off
upon meeting ReikoÅfs sidelong glance. ÅgOh I see,Åh she murmured afterwards. For
some reason, that Åe<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Oh I see</span></i>Åf
carried within itself an emotion that Reiko could not name. As far back as she
could remember, the pop idol never sounded this way around her. She only
wondered what it meant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgShe was a Catholic?Åh Korona asked, her voice returning to
normal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgYes.Åh Reiko nodded curtly as she sensed her face
hardening, her eyes blazing with anger, her blood coursing in her veins like
rivers in a storm. Although Natsune knew that her love for Reiko put her at
odds with the teaching of the Church, she remained fervently faithful to her
God. She believed that as long as she lived a virtuous life, His Almighty would
not mind if she happened to choose another woman for her love interest.
Apparently, He thought otherwise. Her hands curled into fists as her transcending
powers erupted in her soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgWhatÅfs wrong, Reiko? You look so... scary,Åh the Fourth
Head hesitated and took one step backward, her youthful face painted in fright.
She was right. Reiko always appeared murder walking as soon as she was reminded
of the Church. And whenever that happened, the bravest people made excuses to
leave and the weak-willed fool seemed as though they had soiled themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgDo you know what churchgoers and their ministers did to
Natsune when they found out the nature of our relationship, Fourth Head?Åh Reiko
began, ignoring the winds roaring in her ears. ÅgThey, along with my beastly
parents, murdered her. I thought something was strange the very moment Natsune
came home that Sunday. Normally, she would look bright and cheerful despite the
hardships we had to endure. That day, she was barely able to keep herself from
crying. I asked her why but she only kept silent and staring blankly at the
distance. She did not touch her food, she did not touch the magazines she
liked, and every time she saw the Bible, she broke down crying into my arms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgPanicking, I ran to the church Natsune went to once I had
put her to sleep, trying to find out what was wrong. I did. Because they
considered our love forbidden by their God, because they thought it was the
teachings of the Devil, they denied Natsune the passage to the church. Worse,
they never let her go before they finished scolding her just for loving me and
told her that God despised her and would condemn her to Hell when she died.
They even went as far as threatening to burn down our apartment should they see
her <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>shadow</span></i> outside
their gates!Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>Those despicable humans were partly responsible for
NatsuneÅfs breakdown, one of the reasons that smothered the frail flame of life
of ReikoÅfs beloved. She loathed them! She despised them! The first thing Reiko
had done upon being bestowed the Ice Blade from the Lord Orochi had been
avenging NatsuneÅfs death. How she had laughed and cried at the same time
watching each and every one of them stared at her in horror from within the ice
pillars, their lives slowly being extinguished by the unbearable cold. Although
she knew better than anyone that revenge could neither bring her beloved back
to life nor quench her hatred toward the world, she could not stay her hand from
slaying those so-called righteous humans. If she had known of a way to kill
them over and over again, she would have. They deserved it!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅgReiko!Åh</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>The Fourth HeadÅfs yell jerked Reiko back to reality.
KoronaÅfs arms were wrapped around her body, which was covered entirely by a
thin layer of frost. Not just her, though. Everything on the ground, including
the lawn and the flowers and the fountains nearby, were now frozen in ice.
Every step Reiko made on the blades of grass would shatter them as surely as
rock upon an egg. Then it struck her. Horrified, Reiko whipped her head to
NatsuneÅfs grave. She only heaved a sigh of relief when she saw that the
tombstone, along with the white camellia flowers she brought for her deceased
lover, were miraculously untouched. It was all thanks to Korona. The Fourth
Head had been standing before the grave this whole time, guarding it with the
Barrier she wrought. However, the protection of NatsuneÅfs resting place came
with at KoronaÅfs expenses. Since the pop idolÅfs defensive powers were fairly
weak, she ended up taking in all the cold pulsating from ReikoÅfs body in her
rage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgAre you alright, Fourth Head? I am so sorry. I... lost
control of myself.Åh Guilt and pain stabbed at her heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgItÅfs nothing, Reiko,Åh Korona smiled shakily at her while
she tried to get rid of the frost on her body. She appeared chilled to the
bone. ÅgItÅfs only natural for you to be furious. I would be, too, if my
lover....Åh She stopped abruptly, face going red. Gratitude for Korona washed
over her in waves. Where the Fourth Head lacked in decency, she had more than
enough consideration to compensate. Well, Korona had always been thoughtful and
nice to Reiko ever since Reiko told the girl her life story. She could not
understand why, however. Reiko had always put up a wall of separation between
her and others, even to her comrades the Orochi but despite all that, Korona
still managed to grow closer and closer to her. A strange girl, yet... a very
kind one....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgReiko? What are you...?Åh the Fourth Head stammered as
Reiko took off her long black coat and draped it across the other girlÅfs
trembling shoulders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgYou will need something warm if you do not want to catch a
cold, Fourth Head.Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgThank you,Åh Korona looked away, her face crimson, her hot
breath tinged by the frost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>Reiko frowned. The Orochi Fourth Head could not have
developed a fever so quickly, now could she?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgIt is I who need to say so.Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgUh, Reiko, if you donÅft mind me asking...Åh Korona
hesitated. ÅgWhy do you leave Natsune in a place you hate so much?Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgBecause Natsune wished it,Åh Reiko answered in bitterness.
ÅgShe always told me that when she died, she would like to be as close to her
God as possible. Honestly, Fourth Head, I never like the idea but if it could
help NatsuneÅfs soul rest in eternal peace, I am fine with it. It is the least I
could do in exchange for her putting up with all the sadness and pain for my
sake.Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgDonÅft say that,Åh Korona patted Reiko on her shoulder. ÅgIn
having you, she is more fortunate than most of us out here, you know.Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgI would not be so sure were I you,Åh Reiko muttered. ÅgYou
were not there when she suffered. You did not see how I turned her life into
the pit of doom.Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgThen tell me this, Reiko,Åh Korona said suddenly. ÅgSuppose
the storm had not been cleared up by that strange light and you had had no
powers as an Orochi, would you have risked everything and come to visit her
grave?Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgYes.Åh Puzzled, Reiko stared at Korona.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgSuppose you can bring Natsune back but you are to be
condemned in HellÅfs fire forever, would you go and take her place?Åh</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgYes,Åh Reiko said. ÅgAnd your point is?Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgSee?Åh Korona looked up at her and smiled warmly. ÅgIt is
any girlÅfs dream to have someone love her the way you did. No matter how hard
Natsune life was, she must have been very happy, IÅfm sure of it. I would be,
too, if I were her. Because you know what, I would trade anything I ever own,
my Orochi powers, the promise for eternal life, anything, for only a tiny bit
of your love.Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgIt is easier said than done, Fourth Head.Åh Reiko turned
aside, heat gathering in her face. The girl said the most embarrassing things.
ÅgFoolish of you to believe me.Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>Realizing that continuing like this would embarrass her to
death, Reiko changed the topic, ÅgIn any case, Fourth Head, it is rare to see
you up and about at this time of day. You are a night creature, are you not?Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgOh, I am.Åh Korona giggled. ÅgIÅfm supposed to work the first
shift today, you know, but that storm took quite a toll on our studio before it
disappeared. EverythingÅfs a mess because of the flooding since last night and
all. ThatÅfs why IÅfm going to have a bit of time off, isnÅft it cool?Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgNow thatÅfs where youÅfre wrong,Åh Korona argued in a

vacation?Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>&nbsp;The buoyant girlÅfs face went pale. Reiko had
unknowingly struck the girlÅfs AchillesÅf heel, it would appear, the way KoronaÅfs
eyes were suddenly filled with unspeakable agony, the way she dropped her gaze
and studied the ground beneath her feet while her hands curled into tight fists
at her sides. Reiko decided to drop it. She was not interested in knowing
things people did not want her to, anyway. Besides, strange as it might sound,
the Fourth Head was her friend now. Embarrassing oneÅfs friend was out of the
question even for an Orochi... or for her at least. The Lord knew full well how
some of his Followers didnÅft have an ounce of civility or common sense.</p>

got herself a date, a good-looking one at that. IsnÅft it <i><span

KoronaÅfs age walked toward them, a hateful sneer curving her lips. On her neck
hung a silver cross, which dangled violently every time she swayed her body in
a miserable attempt to create a rhythm to her steps. The girl was a Catholic,
which made this very incident a mere coincidence. It was somewhat a relief, for
had she been tailing them all along, she would have witnessed ReikoÅfs powers
going wild. And that would mean Reiko had to finish her off, too, to protect
the secret. She would hate it if she had to kill on NatsuneÅfs passing
anniversary.</p>

embarrassment, anxiety, and fear. She blinked in surprise. An Orochi Follower
who could annihilate a city with one swing of her Sword appearing afraid at the
sight of a mere human? <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>What

Reiko suppressed a smile. The strange girl, Minakawa or whatever her name was,
thought she was a man. Reiko would not blame her, though. It had not been the
first time people made that mistake. Well, her choice of clothes had always
been something that would come up in a guyÅfs mind instead of a womanÅfs. For
one, she always preferred a pair of jeans and a T-shirt to a dress, however
pretty or expensive. Her short hairstyle, her lack of body curves, her deep
voice and her cold demeanor were quite misleading, too. If anything, they only
increased the boyishness of her appearance.</p>

and more. Was it because her personality was much more hideous and repulsive
than that of a snake? Or was it because... Minakawa was making the Fourth Head
uncomfortable? Reiko shook her head slightly, what was she thinking? ÅgDonÅft you

closer than two steps to the male Followers and always spaced herself at the
furthest corner of the room from latter whenever she came to the audience with
the Orochi Lord. Like Reiko herself, Korona had been given indelible scars by
this cruel world. And she was suffering because of them. There Korona stood,

she deserved some credits for that. The way she squeezed her vacant hand
affectionately around ReikoÅfs own, the way she looked up at Reiko with the
gentlest expression ever, and the way she shyly cast down her eyes when their

usually stayed as long as she could, apparently for no purposes even after she
had known whatever there was to know. On a chair next to ReikoÅfs drawing table
the Fourth Head sat, gazing at the images on the papers. However, once in a

merely told to do what <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>they</span></i>
needed to, what <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>they</span></i>
wished until the promised day came, when life everlasting would be granted as a
reward to each and every one of the Heads. Then why did the Lord need them in
the first place if not to do his biddings? What were their purposes in this
conflict between the Dark God and the pitiful mortals? And are the mortals the
true objective of the LordÅfs agenda? Despite having spent a better part of her

said angrily as she stepped toward them, her youthful face a thunderhead. With
a cloak black as the night wrapped around her slender frame, she looked like
death walking. Except that it was not <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Åglooked
likeÅh</span></i>. With her potential higher than that of any other Orochi,
including the First Head himself, Saotome Makoto <i><span style='font-family:

an Orochi was coming...?Åh The brown-haired girl stopped abruptly as though she
had bitten on her tongue. ÅgMy bad, I guess you canÅft,Åh she said with a rueful
tone afterwards. The girl had forgotten how she differed from the rest of the
Orochi, it would seem. ÅgIÅfm sorry.Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgNever mind that, Eighth Head.Åh Reiko waved off the
apology. ÅgWhat business do you have with us?Åh Did the young girl just say <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>unveiled</span></i>? Did that mean the
Eighth Head was able to shield her presence from Reiko and Korona and could
have snuck up on them unnoticed? Now that was scary to even think of. If for
some reason the girl switched to the side of the Priestesses, which was not
exactly improbable considering what kind of relationship the former shared with
the Priestess of the Sun, the other Followers were as good as dead. Perhaps
Reiko should keep an eye on Makoto just in case.</p>

one. We will first meet with the Sixth Head and carry out our mission, which is
to capture the Seventh Head without fail. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅeIt

text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgYou mean all <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>four</span></i>
of us? Just for one single Head?Åh Reiko said in utmost incredulity. Well, the
Seventh Head did defeat the First and stirred up the Followers in a frenzy, but
TsubasaÅfs little <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>brother
complex </span></i>was the reason the man lost to a weaker opponent. It did not
make sense at all to have four Followers ganging up on one Oogami Souma while
the Eighth Head herself could destroy him completely with but a snap of her
fingers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgI see,Åh Reiko muttered noncommittally, not really seeing.
She took a quick glance at the Fourth Head afterwards, though. The girl was
surreptitiously studying her as if she never had a care about the LordÅfs order.
Reiko sighed. Although KoronaÅfs issue still weighed on her mind, she could not
possibly do anything about it now. Later, then.</p>

text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgYou said something, Himeko?Åh shouted Oogami Souma, whose
voice was muffled by his helmet and the winds that were roaring around him.
Riding on his motorcycle along the highway, he was finding himself slightly
light-headed as he felt the tender arms of the girl he loved wrapping around
his body, her soft and curvaceous front pressing against his back. Ever since
she climbed on the bike, he had been dumped into the middle of a fierce
struggle between overwhelming bliss and fear. There could be nothing more
gratifying to him than having the love of his life so close to him... yet he
knew the danger. With his concentration constantly trying to slip away from
him, he ran the risk of crashing the motorcycle somewhere along the metal rails
guarding both sides of the highway. He certainly didnÅft want something like
that to happen on a date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgCan we stop around here, on the beach?Åh the golden-haired
girl shouted back, her words faltering in the howling of the winds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>He was surprised. According to the plan, which she herself
had proposed to him a few days ago, their destination for today was supposed to
be the new theme park in Downtown, which had attracted a huge number of
visitors despite having opened for barely more than a week. Why did she want to
stop by the beach all of a sudden?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgSure,Åh he replied and gently swerved his bike toward the
right. As the motorcycle slowed down on the serpentine highway exit, which was
still wet from the storm that threatened to plague the city and drown the
coastal areas for days, the winds grew gentler and began to sing along with the
birds perching on the green trees flanking the road. The air was only cool, yet
for some reason, he felt Himeko trembling slightly against his back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgThank you... and sorry, Sou-chan,Åh she murmured in a voice
tinged with agony and regret. Puzzled, Souma frowned at the emerging sight of
the sand beach and the sparkling ocean that lay beyond it, trying to figure out
why his princess sounded that way. He was certain that she wasnÅft apologizing
to him for having wanted to change their destination. What, then?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>About five minutes later, they stood atop the wet sand and
quietly studied the oceanÅfs wavy surface, which glittered brilliantly under the
assault of the myriad rays of sunlight descending from a completely <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>cloudless</span></i> sky. No one would
believe him were he to tell them that just an hour or ago, the heavens had been
shrouded by a layer of storm clouds so thick that it would have taken them days
to disperse. They would call him crazy, too, were he to say that Mahoroba would
have seen the heaviest and most terrible rain in her history had a silver aura
not blown away the storm clouds as cleanly and quickly as a gust of wind would
the fallen leaves. He shivered. He knew where that silver light had come from,
and the very knowledge scared him somewhat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>Who could have believed that Himemiya Chikane, a rich
ojou-sama whom he thought too weak to even defend herself, was capable of such
a feat? Sure, Souma could manage it, also, but if anybody told him that he had
to clear the clouded skies above the city in the same amount of time or with
the same contemptuous ease, he would admit that it wasnÅft bloody likely to
happen. Furthermore, such a feat would have left him so drained and weakened
that he doubted he could even hold himself erect for the next several days. And
<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>that</span></i> was the scary
part. Although she had projected an impossibly huge amount of powers into the
heavens, her energy level didnÅft seem to decrease at all. Even at this moment,
somewhere out there, her presence still shone like noonday in his Orochi mind
when it should have dimmed to the light of a candle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>Souma turned to Himeko and grimaced. Not at her, but at the
storm of invisible aura wreathing about her slender body. He was fairly certain
that it was what was left behind upon Himeko after the former played God with
the sky. Yes, it was but a mere <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>residue</span></i>,
yet it had completely blocked out his Orochi sixth sense and rendered him
unable to feel what the golden-haired girl was harboring in her heart. He
didnÅft think the rich girl was helpless anymore. Not when he knew that should
she choose to beat him into submission, she could do so without breaking a drop
of sweat. He had as much chance to win against her, or maybe even to escape, as
a grape against the winepress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:31.5pt'>Giving his head a light shake, he told himself that he was
just being foolish. He fought against the Dark God now, which placed him on the
same side as the Kannazuki Priestesses. There was no chance in hell that
Himemiya Chikane would become his enemy, not when he was putting his life on
the line to protect the girl he loved, the very same girl that <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>she</span></i> loved.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgYes?Åh She said, turning to face him. He almost wished that
she had not. Her face was troubled, her mouth tight, and her eyes filled with
sadness. He felt a shiver slither down his spine. He sensed that whatever she
was going to say to him today, it wasnÅft going to be something he wanted to
hear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

seemed to have grown twice as much. SoumaÅfs heart sank. Perhaps he knew why she
wanted to go out with him today. Three days ago he had confessed his love in
front of her, Tsubasa-nii-san, and Himemiya Chikane. She hadnÅft given her
answer then. He wagered that she was about to right now. And judging by the way
she was gazing at him.... A lump of something rose in his throat.</p>

Ågand sheÅfs in a pinch right now.Åh Souma didnÅft have to be able to read minds to
know that the girl of his dream wasnÅft speaking about any friend in particular.

his particles seemed to be ringing out in agony. HimekoÅfs message was clear,
however indirect. She didnÅft want to tell him flat out that she couldnÅft accept
his feeling, so she staged a story of some imaginary friend instead. Since she
was a kid, she had been acting in such a way. The shy and easily intimidated
Himeko never wanted to say anything to hurt other people, so she always
employed this method to speak her mind. He wagered that she was trying to give
him a way out without hurting his pride and feeling, too. Were he to
acknowledge her intention, she would pretend that he never confessed to her and
continue to be his friend. Were he not to....</p>

because he wanted her to know that she had <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>options</span></i>,
and that Himemiya Chikane wasnÅft the only one who cared about her. He had hoped
that in time, she would realize that there was nothing good that could come
from a relationship with another girl, and that he was the only correct choice
she could make. He didnÅft mean to press her for an answer. Neither did he try
to force her to return his feelings. Yet, it turned out that his plan had
backfired. The only thing that he managed to do was make her panic. Gods, but
he wished he didnÅft say a word to the Orochi First Head.</p>

him that she didnÅft include him among those she thought as <i><span

colored once more, and her eyes fell to the ruby ring on her finger, which she
seemed to be caressing with her gaze. The stone was glowing brilliantly under
the glorious light of the morning sun. Memories, which he had been trying
murderously to suppress, flashed in his mind as bitterness made his stomach
lurch. He knew the person who had given Himeko the ring, and the knowledge was
a full-arm slap on his cheek.</p>

text-indent:31.5pt'>Himeko didnÅft say anything in response. The golden-haired
girl only took up a study of her feet, her face the very picture of a sunset.
The sight made his blood boil. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>So
that was why she summoned me to her house and told me to take Himeko out as
planned, </span></i>he thought.<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>

rich girl only allowed him to go on a date with the little princess because she
knew the latter was going to reject him.</p>

text-indent:31.5pt'>Suddenly, the scenery around them took a drastic change and
doused the rage that was burning Souma inside out. The bottomless blue of the
water and the brilliant azure of the sky faded into a dull gray color as though
he had just been thrown into an ancient black and white movie. To make the
matter worse, his Orochi sense was warning him that three Followers were
drawing dangerously near. ÅgWhy do you have to pick a fight with me now?Åh he
muttered under his breath. Not that he would mind taking on all three Heads at
the same time &#8211; he was confident that RaienÅfs might would help him destroy his
foes the way it defeated the Orochi First Head &#8211; but HimekoÅfs very presence
here put him into a very tough spot. He couldnÅft possibly fight them and keep
the golden-haired girl safe at the same time. Retreating seemed the only
logical answer.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>The golden-haired girl was nowhere to be seen. In her place
on the beach now stood a complete stranger whose body was clad in a cape black
as the night. It couldnÅft have been a man, Souma was sure, for her slender
build and her curvaceous front unmistakably belonged to a woman. However, there
was also no way to verify it, for beneath that deep hood swirled a shadow that
covered all but her eyes. What made the matter more serious and disturbing was
the absence of HimekoÅfs presence in his Orochi mind. Souma could no longer
trace her energy source, which should have remained even if she had been
teleported to the other side of the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:31.5pt'>Terribly worried about the golden-haired girlÅfs well-being
as he was, Souma still didnÅft dare take his eyes off of the stranger.
Distraction could do more than kill when done at the wrong time, he had been
taught. The advice from the High Priest could not be truer, especially in this
situation, where someone had actually succeeded in sneaking up on him without
his notice. A shiver ran down SoumaÅfs spine. Neither did he have any clue as to
when this girl showed up nor did he have any idea how she did it. There was one
thing he knew, though. To be able to pull off such a stunt, the girl had to be
exceptionally powerful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

measure the depth of her powers. As far as he was concerned, it was the wrong
move. Panic took over and put an end to his rational thoughts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>Souma leapt backward and never stopped until he had put at
least a dozen feet between them. Sweat poured out from his pores as though he
had just taken a bath. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Gods,
but it was close! </span></i>he thought. The second his soul touched that of
the other girl, Souma had felt as if he was being sucked into a black hole. He
suspected that had he not reacted fast enough, his consciousness would have
been done for. Anger flared up fiercely in him at the thought. That was one
nasty way of greeting someone she just met. Souma summoned Raien into his hand
and pointed its tips at the stranger. If she wanted to be his enemy, so be it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:31.5pt'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅgAnd what
have you done to her? Where is she?Åh</span></i> Souma shouted as he unleashed
RaienÅfs power. Purple lightning swirled and crackled loudly around the shiny
blade. If she werenÅft going to tell him, he would force her to, by any means
necessary. He had very little patience left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgYou think too highly of yourself too frequently,Åh the
Follower said, her voice heavy with contempt. There wasnÅft even the slightest
sign of fear in it. ÅgYouÅfll learn to behave better, Seventh Head.Åh Her right
hand flashed and her forefinger landed on RaienÅfs blade after being released
from her thumb. Despite the fact that the sword gave no vibration after the
impact, an unbelievably powerful force traveled through the thing and arrived
at SoumaÅfs hand, which ultimately unwrapped his fingers off RaienÅfs hilt and
sent them flying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>Not letting the shock faze him, Souma reacted immediately. He
grabbed back Raien with his left hand before the sword could fall to the ground
and slashed at the Orochi girl. The second shock came. Although his left hand
might not be as nimble and fast as his right, his rigorous training schedule
had allowed him to shrink the difference as much as it could. Yet, it didnÅft
seem to have mattered much the way the Orochi girl evaded his swing with but a
turn of her slender body. Before he could strike again, though, she drew a
sword the blade of which was as black as the cloak she wore seemingly out of
thin air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:31.5pt'>The girl pointed her sword at the sky. From below, from
their shadows, a black column emerged, throwing itself at SoumaÅfs stomach.
Hastily, he swung Raien around to block the thing. Although he was in time, he
still couldnÅft resist being hurled away until he was at least five hundred feet
off the shore, where the black column withdrew and left him suspended between
the gray sea beneath and the lifeless heavens above. Fear roamed his mind. Not
even Tsubasa-nii-san had the power to do this to him. How the heck could this
girl be so strong?</p>

would water. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Tasogare!</span></i><i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'> </span></i>he thought, startled.
After the fight with Tsubasa-nii-san, Souma had spent a good amount of time
learning about the Elemental Blades from the Shingetsu High Priest, which
earned him the knowledge that there was only one thing that rivaled the
terrible Hokuto his blood brother wielded. Tasogare the Twilight Blade. Never
once did he expect to be confronted with it so quickly. It would seem that
today there was nothing life had in store for him except bad luck.</p>

arrived, right inside this prison the girl made. Cold winds almost as sharp as
knives came at him from every direction, trying to slice him into bits. Below
him, the seawater had been completely frozen, waves caught in the middle of
crashing down upon the surface. Somewhere to his left, from a crack in the ice,
a gigantic tree grew up so rapidly that it now towered hundreds of feet over
where it once was moments ago.</p>

a pretty boy. That boyish Orochi, in simple shirt and pants and black coat,
stood on the tip of a frozen wave, her hand clutching the hilt of a sword the
thin blade of which seemed as fragile as the pair of glasses she wore. Another
Follower in green dress and blouse suspended in midair. She he knew and
couldnÅft possibly forget, for when he saw her a while ago, Arashigumo the Wind
Blade in her hand nearly killed the Sun Priestess. This time, she would not
escape with a mere scratch again, heÅfd make sure of it. And the last of the
three, a scandalously dressed young woman, was sitting on one of the large
treeÅfs branches, her emerald eyes shining with <i><span style='font-family:

the situation instead. Then he smiled. Despite the... unfortunate outcome with

that three of the stolen Sealed Swords &#8211; Arashigumo the Wind Blade, Asayuki the
Ice Blade and Chiseizaha the Earth Blade &#8211; were all here, Souma could retrieve
them and dispose of the Orochi Followers at the same time. His smile broadened
while his hand tightened around RaienÅfs hilt. Without three out of seven Blades
as well as the same number of his acolytes, the Dark God was as good as
crippled.</p>

His stomach lurched slightly. Come to think of it, he never noticed how she
could manage to use her powers when Raien had already been summoned. Could it
be... that there was another Elemental Blade that the Voice of Sorrow had no
effect on like Hokuto? Furthermore, did the three Orochi Followers not change
the surrounding environment when they appeared? WasnÅft he still holding Raien
the whole time? Did that not mean their powers were intact, too? A horrible

built to keep in Oogami Souma and the other Heads, Saotome Makoto wondered how
long it would take the latter to finish the former. True, he were one and they
were three, yet she couldnÅft deny that one of those three was a girl who
detested killing, one was so weak she didnÅft even deserve to be called an
Orochi, and one was apparently too occupied with her own thoughts that she
could barely register what was happening around her. On the other hand, Oogami
Souma was very strong, a little bit stronger than Oota Reiko herself, Makoto
would say, so this might just become an even fight despite the fact that three
adults were ganging up on one teenaged boy. </p>

she could shrink to <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>nothingness</span></i>
anytime she felt like it. The traitor was but a filthy rat caught in a trap.
His fate was already decided, and there was nothing he could do to escape his
demise.</p>

air, Makoto carefully made sure that the shadow hiding the lower part of her
face and the little spell she used to disguise her voice were still in effect.
Then, she turned around and walked into a second dimensional prison, one that
was significantly smaller than the first. As soon as she stepped past one of
its walls, invisible, undetectable, and impenetrable to any other, she saw her
former roommate, Kurusugawa Himeko, the love of her life. The girl, whose
golden hair fell in a glorious stream all the way to her slim waist, was
standing but a few feet away from Makoto, looking terribly anxious and afraid.
Makoto wouldnÅft blame her. If she herself, before she was bestowed the power of
the Orochi of course, was suddenly thrown into a place where there was no
escape, she would freak out for sure.</p>

Tasogare to her hand. The sword, black blade and black edges appearing to be
sucking in the light around them, made Himeko put one more step between them.
With the Twilight Blade, the strongest of all Sealed Swords, in her possession,
no feat was impossible to Makoto. Not even <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>sealing</span></i>
the powers of the greatest enemy of the Orochi Lord.</p>

exact copies of itself, which surrounded the Sun Priestess in a perfect circle.
The six round crystals, which separated the hilts and the blades of the Swords,
pulsed ominously beneath the gray heavens. Giving her love a smile beneath the
shadows obscuring the lower half of her face, Makoto snapped her fingers and
activated the spell she had just laid. A thick rod of black light emerged from
every single one of the crystals and connected with one other, forming a
hexagram with Himeko at its center in the end. The six-pointed star then
started to revolve around the Priestess of the Sun, who seemed to have already
fallen under the power of the Twilight Blades the way she suddenly collapsed
onto her knees and suddenly clutched at her chest. She was having trouble
breathing, too.</p>

crystals and met one another just above HimekoÅfs head, consequently creating a
pyramid-like structure. At the exact moment of its completion, an invisible
force lifted the golden-haired girl off the sandy ground. The Priestess, eyes
closed and arms outstretched like those of a cross, now had her consciousness
forcefully shut down. However, the Sun Crest, the source of her holy powers, was
not, for it now shone like noonday in the middle of its masterÅfs chest and
flooded the prison formed by the Twilight Blades with its golden aura.</p>

Roses of Ototachibana Academy, her back leaning against the oak tree, eyes
closed, her mind filled with gloomy thoughts when her mind alerted her of alien
presences of powers. Her eyes opened just in time to see a Dimensional Portal
opened just a few feet away. From the oval-shaped silvery surface stepped out
two persons, one male and one female whose face she did not know. Darkly
tanned, the woman wore a pair of rectangular glasses and a mischievous
expression over her face. The man, on the other hand, was expressionless in his
grave black suit. Orochi, without a doubt, Chikane thought. Very few others in
this world knew how to cross distances using a Portal. Even fewer had any
reason to appear before her.</p>

could not even withstand a blow from the Orochi with Arashigumo the Wind Blade.
Now, she had enough power to carry out her threat. It was ironic, really, how
she used to pray that she would become stronger to protect the one she loved.
Now that she had, Himeko no longer needed her protection. The little angel had
her knight in shining armor to watch over her and give her everything she could

afraid she had to be feeling inside. The man standing next to her only seemed
worried the way he kept glancing at his companion as though trying to tell her
that they should just do what Chikane had suggested. The stubborn glance the

text-indent:31.5pt'>A terrible chill seized him. Somehow, without him noticing,
Himemiya had risen to her feet. The girl now stood behind Miyako, her face
colder than the heart of winter, her sapphire eyes glowing with murderous
intent. Soundlessly, her hand rose and powers bloomed in her like the heaviest
storm he ever had the chance to witness. In but a heartbeat, she had gathered
enough energy to raze the whole Academy to the ground. Silver light blazed from
her palm as if she held the midday sun. Then it plowed forward, the tips of its
fingers aimed directly at his sisterÅfs back.</p>

text-indent:31.5pt'>Although he succeeded in grabbing MiyakoÅfs arm and pulling
her out of harmÅfs way, he failed in protecting himself. Pain pierced him as the
PriestessÅfs hand, wreathed in brilliant silver light, parted the flesh on his
shoulder as easily as a knife would butter. Smoke billowed from his body and
the smell of burning flesh permeated the cold air as he screamed and fell.</p>

his sister cried. The Orochi Second Head was holding him in her embrace as
though wanting to protect him against the girl who stood imperiously before
them. Yet, he could hear her quickened heartbeat, he could feel her arms
trembling, and he could sense her fear. Miyako had never been brave. He tried
to retrieve his Suikyou, which lay but a foot away from his hand, so that he
could keep his sister safe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>Before Tokiya could reach the Water Blade, though, a thin
silver thread coming out of nowhere whisked the Sword into the air... and held
it airborne in front of the Moon Priestess. The girl, her arms folded beneath
her chest, her whole body cloaked by impenetrable serenity and a thick layer of
light, studied Suikyou with an unreadable expression. If Death were to take a
physical form in this world, she would look the way Himemiya Chikane did now.</p>

Fire Blade. Yet, before she could do anything with the Sword, another wisp of
silver aura curled around the thing and took it away as easily as an adult would
snatch a toy away from her childÅfs hand. Shocked, the Orochi Second Head
invoked more of her powers, apparently attempting to call Rekkyou back to her
hand. Blood withdrew from her face a few minutes later, when she finally
realized that it was not going to happen no matter how many more times she
tried. The Fire Blade and the Water Blade now stayed airborne in front of the
Priestess, wrapped in her silver light and infinitely beyond their grasp.</p>

text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgGive them back!Åh commanded Miyako, who quickly fell silent
at a frosty sidelong glance from the Priestess. The Orochi Second Head quivered
as if struck, but sounds no longer came from her petulant mouth. Aside from the
Dark God, whom she feared, and Tsubasa the First Head, whom she adored, no one
else had ever been able to force her to shut up like this. Tokiya shivered from
the cold winds that had been raging in this secret garden the moment the
Priestess deployed her powers... and from the possibility of what was going to
happen to them. They were as helpless as fish caught out of water now... and
Himemiya Chikane was someone who could flay them anytime she wished. </p>

blue-haired girl had settled her icy gaze upon him and his sister both. A
second later, it came back to the Swords floating in front of her. When she
closed her eyes and slightly raised her head, a great pillar of silver light,
the base of which encompassed the whole rose garden, soared forth into the sky.
In less than a blink of an eye, Suikyou the Water Blade and Rekkyou the Fire
Blade were snapped into pieces.</p>

text-indent:31.5pt'>Standing high in the sky, body wreathed in a magical force
field that cloaked both her body and her presence from just about everybody
else, Rinne quietly observed the raging battle field. In her vision, there was
two dimensional prisons, one big, one small, both concealing the vicious
battles being fought within. In the larger one, three Orochi Followers were
trying their best to destroy the traitor Seventh Head while doing everything in
their power to prevent the latter from having any chance to counterattack. In
the other one, Saotome Makoto the Eighth Head was pitching every ounce of her
power against that of the Sun Crest. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>Rinne chuckled quietly. She had been very amused earlier,
during the audience between the girl and the Crystal Orb, that which housed the
true body of the Dark God of Blood and Destruction, for the former had
volunteered herself to the task of sealing the Sun Priestess, which she also
proposed. The girl, who seemed to have nerves made from cold steel, had said it
directly to the face of her liege lord that she did it because she wanted to
ensure Kurusugawa HimekoÅfs safety until the end of the world. Rinne could see
where the girl was coming from. She must have thought that if she could seal
the power of the Sun Priestess, Yamata no Orochi would no longer had a reason
to go after the latter, consequently removing her from the FollowersÅf death
list. That was the only reason why Makoto <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>demanded</span></i>
such a thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>Her chuckle grew louder and much more amused. Despite the
fact that what the Eighth Head desired and what Rinne did contradicted each
other point by point, she had <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>allowed</span></i>
the Dark God to grant his assent. It was not as though the girl had any chance
of success anyway. She seriously doubted everything would go as smoothly as the
former track-and-field athlete had wanted it to. True, Kurusugawa Himeko
couldnÅft use a hundredth of her transcending powers. True, the Sun Crest alone
could stand no chance against the might of a Sealed Sword. Yet, neither of
these two facts took into account the intervention of the Sun PriestessÅfs
protector, Tsukiyomi the Goddess of the Moon. The woman, overly protective of
her adopted child, would thwart any attempt to harm a hair on Kurusugawa
HimekoÅfs head no matter what her bastard father, Izanagi of Heaven, ordered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>Well, Rinne was wrong about that, much to her dismay. The
Goddess of the Moon was nowhere in sight when she should have been there from
the very beginning, watching over the Priestess the way she always had. Not
that it changed anything, of course. While she was listening to Saotome Makoto
speaking with the Crystal Orb without the formerÅfs knowledge, she had allowed
room for miscalculation. That was why <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>she</span></i>
was here. In case anything went wrong, she would be ready to make it right. She
rewarded herself with a smile. It seemed that her carefulness had paid off.
Since Tsukiyomi had gone missing, which was extremely unusual, there was no way
the Sun Crest could stop Makoto from sealing it. Unless... Rinne extended a
hand and prevented the Eighth Head from doing that.</p>

mind and whipped her head to the left, where she found a colossal pillar of
silver light uniting the heavens and the earth. Frantically, she let her mind
reaching out to learn what was happening there. Once she did, she sensed her
mouth gaping open. The fool Orochi Second and Third Head had ignored her order
and gone ahead to attack Himemiya Chikane, the Priestess of the Moon! <i><span

disobedient siblings had better wished that Rinne would arrive on time to save

waging against the Sun Crest, Saotome Makoto could not help but hear a
thunderous noise echoing into her Dimensional Prison. When she looked up, she
spotted a huge column of silver light connecting heavens and earth. She gaped.
This presence of power... it could be no one else. <i><span style='font-family:
"Footlight MT Light"'>Himemiya Chikane! </span></i>she thought in alarm. Worse,
she also sensed the presences of the Second and the Third Orochi Heads
dangerously close to that of the rich girl... and the FollowersÅf life signs
were growing weaker and weaker by the minute. It was as though they were dying!
Fear entered MakotoÅfs mind. Could it be that the Priestess of the Moon had
personally sought Girochi Miyako and Girochi Tokiya out so that she could kill
them?</p>

text-indent:31.5pt'>A loud cracking sound nearby cut off her train of thoughts and
whipped her head back toward the Seal she had formed around Kurusugawa Himeko,
the Priestess of the Sun. Her mouth fell open. The pyramid-like structure was
once empty save for the floating body of her former roommate inside. Now, it
was filled by a seemingly endless ribbon of red light one end of which was tied
to the golden-haired girlÅfs little finger. The ribbon, appearing deceivingly
harmless, was beating fiercely against the inner walls of the Seal with its
impossible length... and whenever it did, the entire structure along with its
anchors, the Twilight Blades, trembled. The Seal now looked exactly the same
way a kettle, lid closed, spout plugged, and content boiling, would atop a
stove.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

could summon into the Swords, trying to make them hold against the assault of
the red ribbon. Dazzling light, red from the serpentine length and golden from
the Sun Crest, fused as one to battle the dark aura of the Sealed Swords. They
won. As a thunderous sound erupted, the Seal along with five of the six
Tasogare disintegrated, leaving only the original unharmed. Waves of red and
golden light, spreading in all direction, shattered the Dimensional Prison
Makoto made and hurled her off the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:31.5pt'>Once she managed to place herself firmly in the air, she
was at least a hundred feet away from where she last stood. There, the
Priestess of the Sun remained in the same posture, her body trapped within a
pillar of golden light, around which the red ribbon spiraled upward until a
part of its length vanished in the cloudless heavens.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:31.5pt'>Her heart simmering with anger, Makoto summoned Tasogare
back into her hand and directed its tip toward the ribbon. No matter what it
was, she was going to cut it into pieces. And once she succeeded, she would try
again to Seal the Sun Crest. She only hoped she still had enough energy left to
do what she had to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:31.5pt'>Makoto rushed at the pillar of golden light. When she was
but a few inches away from slashing the Twilight Blade at the ribbon, time and
space seemed to freeze around her body. The air suddenly became as thick as the
earth, and she felt as if she was being crushed from all sides. Yet, even when
she was held firmly above the ground, unable to twitch a muscle or utter a
word, she could still notice that HimekoÅfs expression was starting to change.
Agony slowly manifested upon the girlÅfs lovely face. She seemed immersed in a
dream so sorrowful it wrenched her heart.</p>

Makoto had no idea where they came from, floated across her vision, all of them
bearing the figures of two girls who looked exactly the same as Himeko and Himemiya
Chikane. In some, they were laughing together or embracing one another. In
others, the two were sparring with swords in hand. And the last of the images
was the most shocking of all. Makoto gasped. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>It

exasperation as he tried to evade the spells that the three Followers were
hurling at him. For the last fifteen minutes or so, all that he did was glide
in the air in a ragged path, changing his direction every few seconds, so that
he wouldnÅft be hit. Compared to the battle he had with Tsubasa-nii-san a few
days ago, this one was every bit as vicious. Despite the fact that none of the
Orochi he was facing, or running away from to be precise, seemed as good a
swordsman as the First Head, they all were long-range spell casters. And they
were strong! Shortly after the battle began, Souma realized that his chance of
winning was slim to none. Under their heavy fire, Souma had no room for
defense, let alone counterattack. If he fended off one of the Orochi, he would
be cornered and fall prey to the other two in a heartbeat. That was why he had
to run around like this. Although it hurt his pride a great deal, he didnÅft

knelt at her feet and asked after her health. It was as though she never saved

metal slabs. In less than a heartbeat, they started to rumble as they slid
sideways to reveal the interior of a great chamber the only source of

heart. In it was a liquid that shone with the color of emerald. In it...
floated an unconscious Goddess of the Sun. YueÅfs heart quivered at the sight.</p>

of the great crystal cylinder she knelt, her hands placed on its surface, her
head lifted up so she could look at the face of the Goddess of the Sun, radiant
even when unconscious. Since she no longer had any control on herself, there
was nothing Yue could do to stop the tears from thundering down her cheeks.</p>

breaking like stepped-on glass. ÅgYou are never meant to learn. The only thing
you are supposed to know of is my hostile feelings towards you. Yui, I tried to
make that hatred reality, too, for I thought it would make my life easier to
live without thinking fondly of you days and nights. Yet, the more I forced
myself to hate you, the more I... I.... But no matter what happens, no matter

crystal container, Yue started to curse herself for being a weak-minded fool.
Not just that, she knew that she was a coward, she was an idiot, and she was...
everything she hated in other people. Even when Yui could not hear the truth,
even when there was no one here to listen to her secret, Yue still could not
say what she needed to, what she had been hiding in her heart for the last
three thousand years, and what she wished to tell the Goddess of the Sun the
most. Pathetic was what she was. Who could have thought that Tsukiyomi, the
Goddess of the Moon, whom Heaven aspired to, was such a weakling?</p>

of the SunÅfs mysterious insomnia. Three days ago, the young Moon Priestess had
said. It was the day in which a careless and thoughtless duel of spells from
Aoi and Akari turned into a disaster. It was the day in which the Kannazuki
Priestesses decimated AoiÅfs private chamber. It was the day in which Yue handed
out her very first punishment to make them learn that they had to be much more
careful with their transcending powers. It was the very same day in which Aoi
was moved into AkariÅfs chamber. The former was supposed to stay there until the
complete reconstruction of her own chamber, of which both of them were in
charge. Everyday, the two Priestesses had to invoke every ounce of their powers
to rebuild the burnt-down roof, smooth out uneven surface that used to be the
floor, and a hundred other chores to make the chamber habitable again.</span></i></p>

very presence in AkariÅfs room at night was the reason why the latter could not
sleep. It was no secret to Yue that the Sun Priestess harbored such an immense
crush on her childhood friend that it never failed to make her eyes chase after
the Moon Priestess wherever she went. Hard as the child tried to hide her
emotions, though, she never ceased to wear her heart on her sleeve within two
feet of her crush. Besides, it was not as though she could fool Yue when Yue had
spent her childhood doing the same thing anyway. </span></i></p>

learn it. It was odd, however, that although they shared the same birthday and
birthplace, Akari shared none of her childhood friendÅfs genius. The young
Priestess of the Sun, despite having transcendent powers and being an
exceptional cook, was but a normal girl in everything else. Still, that was not

was about time she should be. Yue had never seen Aoi, or Akari for that matter,
alone for more than half an hour, ever. If one was missing for a minute longer,

her underlip and stopped herself from saying the rest of what she wanted to
say. Asking that only made her appear to be much more suspicious, if that was
possible.</p>

meaningful glance and an equally meaningful smile. Her eyes, dark as her hair,
gleamed mischievously in the emerald light of the crystal container. ÅgYou would
understand why I could not give a clear answer, Tsukiyomi. Someone as ancient
as I hardly pay heed to the passage of time any more.Åh</p>

text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgYou mean the two children standing guard?Åh Izanami-sama
laughed softly behind a raised hand. ÅgThey did try to do as you commanded,
daughter, but I managed to persuade them not to. Do not take it out on them
later, I ask of you. Between my order and yours, it is hardly difficult to
guess which one they chose to heed.Åh</p>

text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgI... understand,Åh Yue muttered darkly. For all her
calculations, she failed to realize that there was someone else in the
Underworld who had a position higher than hers. If the Regent of the Underworld
wished to enter unannounced, who were Ren and Kuuya, two lowly guardswomen, to
say that she could not?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:31.5pt'>ÅgVery well,Åh Izanami-sama said simply and continued
studying Yue as though she were something that the Mother had seen for the
first time in her life. Under the Supreme RulerÅfs intense scrutinizing eyes,
which seemed more than capable of boring deep into the darkness of her soul and
extracting everything she was hiding in her heart, YueÅfs limbs threatened to
turn into water. Fortunately for her, the Mother of All withdrew her
penetrating gaze and turned toward the tall crystal cylinder within which the
Goddess of the Sun was floating unconscious. Yue was very glad that she did,
for had Izanami-sama continued what she was doing, Yue might probably have
spilled out every secret that she had kept.</p>

Mother while a thousand thoughts crossed her mind. Why did the Regent of the
Underworld come to Onogoro in secret? How was it possible that she arrived so
on time that she was able to prevent the demise of the Sun Goddess? And why did
she bring her to the Rosenkyuu, where there was a jungle of equipments ready
for the young womanÅfs treatment? Yue was under no false illusion that the two
of them had been keeping contact with each other for a while now. And the most
important question of all was... what could a high-ranking Immortal of Heaven
could have been scheming in the shadows with the Lady of Reiha, which had been
at odds with Izumo for the last three thousand years?</p>

clothes, which had been covering every inch of her body beneath her chin,
became transparent, allowing Yue the sight of the Sun GoddessÅfs pale skin. She
gasped in horror. Encompassing YuiÅfs naked frame was a strange scarlet symbol
that gleamed metallic in the green light. She had never seen such a thing in
her entire life, yet even the most ignorant of Immortals could still realize
that it was a....</p>

To make it worse, the Supreme Ruler of Reiha turned her head and looked at Yue
with a knowing gleam in her dark eyes that were filled with agony.</p>

Immortal who was powerful enough to surpass the great Goddess of the Sun, one
whose curse was beyond the Mother of AllÅfs capacity. Yue looked at the Regent,

Yue just said. The eternal youthful and resplendent Regent only focused her
attention on an unconscious Yui and nothing else. A thought suddenly crossed
YueÅfs mind. It was true that unlike Izanagi, the Lady of Reiha was a warm and
friendly person who cared deeply for the well-being of her subordinates. Yet...
the tenderness and the affection with which she had been treating the Goddess
of the Sun were certainly unheard of. Yue felt her stomach lurch. If what she was
thinking of was indeed the truth, then every of her unasked questions would
also be explained. But... but... could it be?</p>

laughter. ÅgAnytime you wag your tail, I know exactly what you are thinking,

amused sidelong glance before she continued, ÅgWorry not. Since I do not have
your <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>peculiar</span></i>

Izanami-sama said warmly. ÅgAmaterasu is a lovely girl. She has charisma, strong
personality, and an unyielding will. She is the only person in Izumo whom I
admire, for she will not stop at anything to grant the wish of the one she
loves. You can hardly find someone as devoted as she in this day and age.Åh</p>

Amaterasu yourself when she wakes.Åh The Regent of the Underworld gave her a
playful smile that drove it home to Yue that no matter how many more times she
could ask, she still would not get an answer. She sighed. When the Mother
decided to act mysterious, she would not admit it should anyone ask her whether
the color of her hair was black. That was why Izanami-sama was extremely
difficult to deal with sometimes.</p>

you for wanting to.Åh</p>

text-indent:31.5pt'>It was the simple truth, in any case. The desire to see Yui
once more and the fervent wish to be by her side again had been what spurred
Yue toward the decision to rescue the Lord of Izumo from his prison. Until the
day she turned eighteen, she had been living in the Holy City, where she grew
up along with the young Goddess of the Sun, the person whose bride she thought
she would become one day. Those had been the happiest years in YueÅfs life, for
her every day revolved around YuiÅfs sweet and melodious laughter. Every
morning, Yue would wake before the sun could rise and wait anxiously until she
heard her sweetheartÅfs soft footfall outside of her room. Every morning, she
would close her eyes, pretend that she was still asleep until the golden-haired
Goddess opened the door, walked in, woke her up by rocking her arm gently, and
whispered <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅgGood morning,
Yue-chanÅh</span></i> into her ear afterwards in her amazingly adorable voice.
It had been all Yue could do to not pull the other girl into her arms and kiss
her for all she was worth.</p>

Conflict broke out in Heaven, the very same day her Mother took her back to the
Underworld, was also the one in which she thought she would die. She could not
eat, she could not force her lips to touch water, and the only thing she was
capable of was crying until she fell asleep.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:31.5pt'>In her hearts, perhaps she had realized that with Reiha and
Izumo now saw each other as enemies, there was no way she could be reunited
with the one she loved. Grief, the emotion dominating her heart at that time,
was allowed to gnaw at her will to live as a result. Eventually, her
consciousness faded, her powers waned, and her soul slowly broke down. In her
distant memory, she could still remember lying on the bed and breathing weakly
while her Mother tried her hardest to keep Yue alive. She would have died then
had it not been for Izanagi-samaÅfs sudden intrusion into Reiha, the Heart of
the Underworld. The sole thought that the Lord of Izumo would somehow bring Yui
with him returned just enough strength to YueÅfs lifeless body just to hear a
piece of disturbing news. The man she now called father meant to take Yue back
to Izumo by force. He failed &#8211; thanks to the power of the Crystal Roses, which
sustained the Sealing Field around Reiha &#8211; and ended up being imprisoned by the
Lady of Reiha. But that had given Yue an idea, nonetheless. Throwing all
rationality and loyalty behind, Yue freed the man and fled with Him to the Holy
City.</p>

she had traveled back into the past, to a time when she was still little and
clinging to her motherÅfs sleeve. ÅgDo not fear. Do not feel guilty. I have never

all about it. The reason why she had to humiliate Yui publicly at any chance

would come back. Upon regaining consciousness a few hours ago on the beach, the
only thing that remained in her memory was what had happened before she found
herself trapped in a strange place with an Orochi and nothing after that.
Sou-chan had not seemed particularly happy, though, that she still remembered
what she had told him about her and the Himemiya Ojou-samaÅfs relationship.
During their trip home, they had not spoken even one word to each other. Once
the boy had dropped her off in front of the Himemiya Mansion, he only gave her
a sad look, which made her feel extremely guilty, before he sped away on his

keep a promise before. Himeko was worried sick about the safety of her
sweetheart... yet unlike the maids, who were running around the house and
phoned everybody they knew to check whether those people knew the whereabouts

text-indent:31.5pt'>Panting madly, Oogami Kazuki ran as fast as he could down
the stone flight of stairs leading toward the Enshrinement Chamber of
Shingetsu. Something big was happening down there, he knew it. Otherwise, his
heart wouldnÅft have started to pound madly in alarm when he was relaxing in his
bath.</p>

text-indent:31.5pt'>One step into the Chamber halted Kazuki in his track.
Someone else was in there, standing imperiously in front of the Shinken Seals
and ice pillar that housed Ame no Hitomi, the treasure that the Oogami clan had
been standing guard over for the last three thousand years. And that someone
was none other than Himemiya Chikane herself. However, before him now was a
person he did not recognize. It wasnÅft that her appearance had changed. She was
still the pretty girl who had slaughtered him with her sharp and merciless
words during the meeting in which he told her and her partner about the legend
of the Kannazuki Priestesses.</p>

text-indent:31.5pt'>What was no longer the same was her facial expression,
which was heavens and earth different from that of the daughter of his old
friends, Himemiya Kyou and Himemiya Kimika. The girlÅfs sapphire eyes were
glowing with a light so cold it could have snuffed out even the sunÅfs fire. Her
whole body was brimming with so much power she could have obliterated the whole
Mahoroba City without a drop of sweat. When KazukiÅfs eyes traveled to her right
hand, he felt his throat run dry. She was holding a Japanese katana whose blue
scabbard was embedded with the Moon Crest. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>One
of the Eyes of Heaven!</span></i> Kazuki thought. The events that had
transpired tonight, without his knowledge, could have meant only one thing.</p>
