<h1>Spiral of Destiny (part 13 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kannazuki/index.html">Kannazuki no Miko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nwarford.html">Nathan Warford</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kannazuki/kannanisou-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Everyone stared at Kazuki. There were no words to describe the feelings 
of bewilderment that they felt. All they could do was stare at the 
shrine keeper, their jaws agape and their eyes wide. &quot;Hi--Himemiya?&quot; 
Chikane stuttered. 

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; said Kazuki. &quot;The Himemiya family is descended from 
Susanou. After defeating Orochi, Susanou found the legendary sword, Ame 
no Murakumo, inside Orochi&#39;s tail. He was the wielder of Ame no Murakumo 
in the form of a sword. And as the descendant of Susanou, you have the 
power to control it.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m...the descendant......of Susanou?&quot; it took all that Chikane had to 
keep from passing out from the shock of what she had learned. 

&quot;You have always had powers unlike those of any other person you have 
met, correct?&quot; 

&quot;Always?&quot; Chikane asked. &quot;No......&quot; She trailed off as she tried her 
best to regain her sense of reality. &quot;No,&quot; she then said with 
discernment. &quot;It was only on my sixteenth birthday when my powers began 
to manifest themselves. I sensed that Himeko was in danger when Souma 
summoned Take no Yamikazuchi for the first time.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s the day that the Solar Mark appeared on my body, isn&#39;t it?&quot; 
Himeko asked. 

&quot;And the day that the Lunar Mark appeared on mine,&quot; Chikane added. 

&quot;It&#39;s obviously the bond between the two Priestesses that allowed Miss 
Himemiya&#39;s powers to be expressed,&quot; said Kazuki. 

&quot;So the reason I have these powers,&quot; Chikane said, &quot;it&#39;s because I&#39;m the 
descendant of a god?&quot; 

&quot;Correct,&quot; said Kazuki. &quot;Even though both you and Miss Kurusugawa are 
priestesses, even though Ame no Murakumo uses both of your powers to 
seal away Orochi, according to what is written on the kamidana, you are 
the only one that can control the Ame no Murakumo because you are the 
descendant of the god that had the same power.&quot; 

&quot;What about Tsukuyomi no Mikoto?&quot; asked Himeko. &quot;Why does Chikane have 
the power to summon the god of the moon?&quot; 

&quot;Susanou and Tsukuyomi are siblings,&quot; said Kazuki. &quot;She must be doing 
all that she can to protect the descendant of her brother.&quot; 

&quot;Why didn&#39;t Tsukuyomi tell me?&quot; wondered Chikane. 

&quot;Probably for the same reason I never told you,&quot; Kazuki answered. &quot;There 
was never a need for you to know.&quot; 

&quot;But isn&#39;t that a little unfair?&quot; said Chikane, a hint of anger in her 
voice. &quot;Don&#39;t I have a right to know where I came from?&quot; 

&quot;Chikane...&quot; The dark-haired girl was caught off-guard by Himeko&#39;s 
voice. &quot;Mister Ogami didn&#39;t want you to be overwhelmed by the truth,&quot; 
Himeko said, putting her hand on Chikane&#39;s shoulder. &quot;That&#39;s why he 
waited to tell us.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re right, Himeko,&quot; said Chikane, putting her hand on top of 
Himeko&#39;s. She then turned to Kazuki and said, &quot;I apologize for my 
outburst, Mister Ogami.&quot; She bowed to him to display her regret. 

&quot;Your reaction is understandable,&quot; said Kazuki in a calm, friendly 
voice. &quot;It is a lot to take in.&quot; 

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Chikane, &quot;I could use this knowledge to our advantage.&quot; 
Everyone looked at Chikane with inquisitive expressions. &quot;If I am the 
descendant of Susanou, and if I have the power to control Ame no 
Murakumo, maybe I can convince the gods to find some other way of 
rebuilding the world after Orochi&#39;s defeat. If I can do that...&quot; she 
then looked at the shorter girl next to her and said, &quot;...then Himeko 
and I won&#39;t have to part like we did last year or in our past lives.&quot; 
Chikane turned back to Kazuki and said, &quot;Mister Ogami, I&#39;m ready to 
perform the revival ritual.&quot; 

---------- 

Souma piloted Take no Yamikazuchi through the snowy terrain, trying to 
find the place where he had found Himeko. Yatsu no Onokoshizuchi ran 
close behind Take no Yamikazuchi, followed by Hi no Ashinazuchi and Ho 
no Shuraizuchi. Ooube no Senazuchi, in its centipede form, slithered 
behind, followed by a hovering Izuhara no Tamazuchi. Above them flew 
Take no Yasukunazuchi and Yokusemi no Mizuchi, both under the control of 
Tsubasa. All eight of Orochi&#39;s bodies were on the move to find the 
former Ogami Shrine. 

&quot;How much further is it?&quot; Korona complained. 

&quot;It can&#39;t be far,&quot; Souma replied. 

&quot;This is boring,&quot; cried Nekoko. &quot;Why can&#39;t I boom things with 
Nyan-Nyan?&quot; 

&quot;You can destroy as many mountains as you want,&quot; Rehko mentioned. 

&quot;But cities are much more fun, nya,&quot; the catgirl scoffed. 

&quot;Cities and people will be easy targets once the threat of Ame no 
Murakumo is gone,&quot; said Miyako. 

Suddenly, Take no Yamikazuchi stopped dead in its tracks. &quot;I can sense 
the power of the Priestesses,&quot; said Souma. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; said Tsubasa. &quot;I sense it too.&quot; 

&quot;Me three, nya!&quot; Nekoko said excitedly. 

&quot;Finally I&#39;m gonna get some action,&quot; said Girochi in anticipation. The 
eight Orochi bodies turned their attention to where their pilots were 
directing them, toward the priestesses. 

---------- 

Deeper inside the cave, Chikane and Himeko had stared the revival 
ritual. Kazuki and Yukihito looked on as Chikane and Himeko recited the 
revival prayer in front of a large fire, below a kamidana and the Six 
Holy Swords needed to be broken by the Priestesses&#39; power. &quot;The mighty 
and brave Susanou no Mikoto. The country of Izumo falls on the river of 
sunlight.&quot; 

Just then, the Solar Mark on Himeko&#39;s chest and the Lunar Mark on 
Chikane&#39;s back lit up. &quot;Evil approaches,&quot; Chikane said. 

&quot;The Orochi are coming!&quot; cried Himeko. 

&quot;I&#39;ll take care of them,&quot; said Kazuki, quickly standing up. &quot;All of you, 
stay here. The ceremony must not be delayed.&quot; 

Kazuki ran toward the entrance of the cave while Chikane and Himeko 
continued reciting, &quot;Eight-headed dragons of the land, diminish and fall 
to the blade of the Totsuka sword.&quot; 

---------- 

As the Orochi continued through the mountains, they came to the entrance 
of a cave. Above the cave was a wooden torii with large rocks on either 
side, each rock with a circular paper streamer wrapped around it. &quot;Is 
that the entrance to the shrine?&quot; asked Korona. 

&quot;Of course it is, Miss Sixty-Ninth,&quot; said Rehko. &quot;The godly aura is a 
dead giveaway.&quot; 

&quot;How many times have I told you?!&quot; Korona cried. &quot;It&#39;s sixty-eighth!&quot; 

&quot;Stop arguing,&quot; Miyako ordered. &quot;This is not the time for such things.&quot; 
Yastu no Onokoshizuchi&#39;s tentacles extended from the halo on its back 
and shot bolts of lightening at the entrance. The paper streamers on the 
rocks started glowing and the lightening bolts collided with the barrier 
that was created. 

&quot;Megaton Knuckle!&quot; yelled Girochi as Hi no Ashinazuchi retracted itself 
into its huge right arm, ramming itself against the barrier. 

&quot;Go, Final Stage!&quot; said Korona as Ooube no Senazuchi fired a beam of 
green light from between its pincers. 

&quot;Go, Nyan-Nyan!&quot; said Nekoko as Izuhara no Tamazuchi lashed at the 
barrier with its whips of light. 

Rehko transformed Ho no Shuraizuchi into its Jomon-style fired pottery 
form and threw her other self at the barrier, digging into it with Ho no 
Shuraizuchi&#39;s spiky body. Take no Yasukunazuchi unsheathed its sword and 
Tsubasa swung at the barrier with it. Take no Yamikazuchi&#39;s shoulders 
opened up and Souma fired his other self&#39;s glowing, orange disks from 
the openings. Yokusemi no Mizuchi transformed from its bird shape into 
its drill form and attempted to drill itself into the barrier. 

---------- 

&quot;God of Takemi Katana. God of Iwatsutsu no O. God of Kanayama Hiko. God 
of Kanayama Hime. God of Tsurugi no Ikusa. God of Tate no Ikusa. Along 
with the powers of the eight million gods.&quot; Sensing the fury of the 
Orochi&#39;s attacks outside the cave, Chikane and Himeko focused all of 
their energy toward breaking the seal. The kamidana above them started 
glowing yellow as the power of the priestesses filled it. 

---------- 

The barrier started to decay as the Orochi fired every attack at it that 
they had at their disposal. With all eight of Orochi&#39;s bodies attacking 
it, it could not stand up to the power of the eight gods. &quot;One more 
strike!&quot; said Tsubasa, flying his other self at the barrier one last 
time. He swung Take no Yasukunazuchi&#39;s sword at the barrier and it 
broke. &quot;Miyako! Girochi!&quot; commanded the First Neck. 

&quot;We&#39;re on it, Tsubasa,&quot; said Miyako, extending Yastu no Onokoshuzuchi&#39;s 
arms toward the cave. 

&quot;Come to me, Hime,&quot; said Girochi as Hi no Ashinazuchi&#39;s chains slithered 
their way into the cave as well. 

&quot;Stay back, Orochi!&quot; a voice came from the cave&#39;s opening. 

&quot;Huh?&quot; Girochi and Miyako said at hearing the voice. They looked at the 
entrance to the cave to see Kazuki standing there with an o-fuda in his 
hand. Before Yastu no Onokoshozuchi&#39;s arms or Hi no Ashinazuchi&#39;s chains 
could get to the opening, they were reflected by the barrier that Kazuki 
had erected. 

&quot;You piece of shit!&quot; Girochi cried in rage. His other self retracted 
itself into its right arm and its pilot yelled out, &quot;Megaton Knuckle 
Two!&quot; The rockets at the back of the arm fired, thrusting the giant fist 
at Kazuki&#39;s barrier. 

Kazuki struggled as the other Orochi started attacking the barrier. With 
only his own spiritual powers and the single o-fuda, he knew that his 
barrier would not last long. &quot;Hold on just a little longer,&quot; the shrine 
keeper said. &quot;Just last long enough for the revival ceremony.&quot; 

---------- 

&quot;We hereby invoke the revival of Ame no Murakumo,&quot; Chikane and Himeko 
chanted. The Solar Mark and the Lunar mark lit up. &quot;Release the God of 
Susanou and drive out those lives that ought to seek atonement.&quot; The Six 
Holy Swords started to crack as the seal degraded by the Priestess&#39; 
power. &quot;Shinchoku.&quot; With that final word, all six of the swords 
shattered. A brilliant blue light exploded from the kamidana, filling 
the chamber. 

&quot;This light...&quot; said Yukihito. &quot;It&#39;s incredible!&quot; 

---------- 

&quot;Megaton Knuckle Three!&quot; Hi no Ashinazuchi flew at Kazuki&#39;s barrier one 
more time and the barrier collasped. 

&quot;Oh no,&quot; said Kazuki. &quot;The barrier has broken!&quot; 

&quot;Let&#39;s go, Girochi!&quot; cried Miyako. 

&quot;Say goodbye to your shrine,&quot; Girochi laughed. 

Suddenly, a beam of brilliant blue light shot up from the top of the 
mountain, its power blowing the clouds completely apart. With the clouds 
gone, the full moon shone brightly overhead and the Orochi could see the 
beam hit the moon&#39;s surface. &quot;That light,&quot; said Rehko, shielding her 
eyes from the light. 

&quot;What&#39;s going on, nya?&quot; said a frightened Nekoko. 

&quot;I remember that beam,&quot; said Souma. &quot;I saw it last year when Kurusugawa 
was performing the revival ritual. It&#39;s a sign that the Seal of the Six 
Holy Swords has been broken! Ame no Murakumo has been revived!&quot; 

---------- 

As the light within the cave subsided, Himeko and Chikane looked to see 
two swords standing in front of them, one with a red sheath, the other 
with a purple sheath. &quot;The Priestess Blades...&quot; said Yukihito in awe of 
the two swords that had appeared before Chikane and Himeko. 

Himeko picked up the sword with the red sheath and Chikane picked up the 
sword with the purple sheath. Himeko looked at the sword in her hand and 
smiled. &quot;It didn&#39;t recoil,&quot; she said. 

&quot;It&#39;s because you didn&#39;t anger the god by performing the ritual 
improperly,&quot; said Chikane. &quot;You wore the uniform of the Solar Priestess 
and you had me beside you to help share the burden.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; said Himeko. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Chikane said. &quot;I&#39;m glad that I was able to lighten the 
load on your shoulders. I just want you to be happy and I&#39;m happy that I 
could help you.&quot; 

Himeko and Chikane held their swords in front of them and started 
reciting the ritual to call forth Ame no Murakumo, &quot;With these Mutsu 
Swords which we hold before us, we call to the heavens to begin the 
ritual to stop the evil god.&quot; The Solar Mark and Lunar Mark again lit 
up, filling the chamber with their light. &quot;God of swordsmen, Ame no 
Murakumo, descend!&quot; 

---------- 

&quot;We can&#39;t afford to waist any more time,&quot; cried Miyako. &quot;Act now, before 
Ame no Murakumo can arrive!&quot; 

Yatsu no Onokoshizuchi&#39;s arms and Hi no Ashinazuchi&#39;s chains flew toward 
the cave. Kazuki ran inside to escape the constrictive tentacles that 
were flying at him. However, he tripped on a small rock, falling on his 
face. He quickly sat up and looked back at the Orochi&#39;s weapons still 
flying towards him. He gasped in fear and his life flashed before his 
eyes, feeling that he was about to be skewered by the hands and chains 
of the Orochi. 

However, just before they reached him, the flying objects fell to the 
ground at his feet. He looked at the arms and chains in confusion. &quot;It&#39;s 
as if they were severed from their bodies,&quot; he said to himself. 

---------- 

Outside the cave, a bright light was shining in front of the Orochi. The 
seven of them shielded their eyes from the light. As the light subsided, 
they saw a giant, sword-shaped mech in front of them. The sword&#39;s blade 
had touched down right in front of the cave, slicing clean through the 
Second and Third Neck&#39;s tentacle-like weapons. 

Arms extended from the grip of the sword, the blade split into legs, and 
the handle opened up to reveal a head. The mecha that the sword had 
transformed into was colored white, it had blades connected to its hands 
and feet, it had blue and yellow lining, red jewels on its forehead and 
waist, green eyes, a blue spike on the top of its head and four blue 
spikes extending from its back. It was the god of swordsmen itself! It 
was Ame no Murakumo! 

---------- 

OMAKE: 

The Solar Mark and Lunar Mark again lit up, filling the chamber with 
their light. Himeko and Chikane recited, &quot;God of swordsmen, Ame no 
Murakumo, descend!&quot; 

At that time, Kazuki had run into the cave, out of danger of the Orochi. 
Suddenly, a gigantic blade fell through the roof, stabbing Kazuki in the 
head. &quot;Hmm,&quot; the shrine keeper said to himself. &quot;That&#39;s strange. I 
suddenly have a splitting headache.&quot;
