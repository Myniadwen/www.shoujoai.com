<h1>Ame no Murakumo ga Miteru:  Red String (part 3 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kannazuki/index.html">Kannazuki no Miko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dezopengiun.html">DezoPenguin</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kannazuki/redstring-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><P>Himeko was humming a happy little tune as she walked up to the front door of her house 
after returning from school. One of the nice things about a small town—almost a village, 
really—like Mahoroba was that housing was much less expensive than in the city. When they'd 
lived in Chiba, the Kurusugawas had only been able to afford an apartment, but between her 
father's promotion and the lower land values, they now had a house of their own.</P><P>Her 
little brother Shiro was playing in the front yard, throwing a bright red ball covered in 
blue stars. The ten-year-old's new puppy, named, appropriately enough, Kuro, pounced on the 
ball, a flying bundle of black fur. He worried at it with his teeth and batted it back and 
forth between his paws.</P><P>"Aw, Kuro, no, you're supposed to fetch the ball, not run off 
with it!" Shiro complained; apparently the puppy was not picking up on the finer points of 
the game. Kuro looked up at him and woofed, his tail wagging so hard his entire back end 
was wiggling back and forth. Shiro laughed, unable to resist the dog's good 
spirits.</P><P><I>Kuro's kind of like Shiro's version of Chikane-chan</I>, Himeko thought. 
After all, Shiro had wanted a puppy ever since he was three, nearly all his life, and it 
was the move to Mahoroba that had made it possible since they now had both the money and 
the space for it. The thought made Himeko imagine Chikane with puppy ears and a tail and 
she snickered. Kuro heard her, turned, and barked once, which made Shiro 
look.</P><P>"Hime-neechan!"</P><P>"Hi, Shiro! How was school?" Kuro scampered over to her, 
hopping up and probably getting paw prints all over her tights.</P><P>"Not too bad. There's 
a lot of work, though." He frowned. "Why couldn't we have moved before the spring term 
started, so I wouldn't have to catch up?"</P><P>"That's just when Otousan got the job. You 
should be glad that we moved at all."</P><P>Kuro scampered back to Shiro and pounced on his 
shoes, trying to bite at the trailing end of his shoelace. The boy grinned at the 
puppy.</P><P>"Yeah, I'm really glad we came here. I like this place a lot. You seem really 
happy too, neechan."</P><P>"Mmn!"</P><P>"Did something good happen?"</P><P>"Well, I joined 
the kendo team today."</P><P>Shiro laughed.</P><P>"Ha! That's funny, 
neechan!"</P><P>"Shiro, I was serious," Himeko pouted.</P><P>He looked at her in 
disbelief.</P><P>"No way! You're going to fight with swords and everything? But you're a 
total spaz! Do you know which end to hold?"</P><P>Himeko drew herself up 
proudly.</P><P>"Actually, they said I was the second-best one on the team!"</P><P>"Wow!" 
Shiro looked impressed, then went on to explain precisely what he was impressed about. 
"They must be, like, the worst team <I>ever</I> or something!"</P><P>"Oooooh, I am so going 
to...to...to...well, something awful, you can be sure!"</P><P>"Ha! You'd have to catch me 
first," he teased, "and you totally run like a girl." He scampered off, the puppy scurrying 
at his heels. Shiro's laughter at getting the last word in on his big sister trailed in his 
wake, making Himeko sigh. Forgetting that she herself had had pretty much the same concerns 
all day, she drew herself up and thought, <I>That little brat! We'll just see what he's 
saying when we win our first tournament!</I> Full of righteous indignation, she went into 
the house, took off her shoes, and slipped her feet into house slippers.</P><P>"Hi, 
Okaasan! I'm home!" she called. Himeko's mother was a housewife; in Chiba, she'd 
occasionally worked at part-time jobs to help out the family finances in leaner years, but 
with the family in a better financial position she was able to spend her time fully at 
home. Her hobby was <I>ikebana</I>, and Himeko noted a new arrangement on the table in the 
little hall between foyer, living room, and kitchen.</P><P>"Himeko, could you come in here, 
please?"</P><P>"Sure, Okaasan!"</P><P>Her mother sounded serious, and when Himeko walked 
into the neat kitchen, her face was equally serious. She got another surprise, too; her 
father was home early, sitting at the oblong kitchen table where they ate their meals. His 
expression, too, was serious, even dark, his lips pressed together into a thin line and his 
square jaw clenched in a sullen attitude.</P><P>"Otousan, you're home early. Is everything 
all right?"</P><P>Himeko's mother turned from the steaming pot she was stirring.</P><P>"No, 
Himeko," she answered the question for her husband. "Everything is not all 
right."</P><P>Himeko blinked, worried.</P><P>"Is it Otousan's health?" To her father she 
added, "Is that why you're home early?"</P><P>The answer, if any, was interrupted when 
Shiro ran into the room.</P><P>"That smells really good, Okaasan! How long will it be until 
dinner?" Seeing the tense atmosphere, he suddenly fell silent, then asked in a very small 
voice, "Is...is something wrong?"</P><P>"Shiro, please go to your room and take Kuro with 
you. Your mother and I are having an important discussion with your 
sister."</P><P>Ordinarily he would have protested or at least asked what it was about, but 
the boy picked up on the fact that his father was extremely serious. He bent and picked up 
the squirming puppy, then left the kitchen. A few moments later, they heard the patter of 
feet on the stairs telling them that Shiro had obeyed and was not trying to snoop at the 
door.</P><P>"This isn't about your father or myself, Himeko," her mother began again. "This 
is about you, and what you've done."</P><P>"Me?" Himeko squeaked. She hadn't done anything. 
She hadn't even forgotten any of her chores! And it was only the second day of school, so 
her parents couldn't be annoyed about her grades again.</P><P>"Himeko, what's wrong with 
you? How could you have done such a thing?" her father suddenly barked, making her jump in 
shock.</P><P>"Dad, what are you talking about?" she asked helplessly.</P><P>"Did you think 
we wouldn't find out? That there weren't going to be consequences?"</P><P>"I don't 
understand. I haven't done anything!"</P><P>They both stared at her.</P><P>"Are you 
actually going to stand there and deny it to our faces?" he snapped, his anger building. 
Himeko's mother, though, actually started to look hopeful.</P><P>"Now, Hajime, dear, Himeko 
has never lied to us in the past. After all, it's only rumors. Perhaps it's only been a 
misunderstanding."</P><P>"A misunderstanding! She—" He broke off, then took a deep breath, 
mastering his emotions.</P><P>"You'll tell us the truth, won't you, Himeko?"</P><P>"Of 
course, Okaasan."</P><P>"Well, then?"</P><P>Himeko stared at her 
helplessly.</P><P>"Himeko?"</P><P>"You haven't even told me what I'm supposed to have 
done!"</P><P>They looked at her incredulously, then at each 
other.</P><P>"Eiko?"</P><P>Himeko's mother nodded.</P><P>"We didn't say, you know. And if 
it isn't true, then she really might have no idea what we're talking about."</P><P>Hajime 
Kurusugawa nodded, then turned back to his daughter.</P><P>"Do you know a girl named 
Himemiya at school?"</P><P>"Chikane-chan? Of course! She's beautiful and amazing and I know 
you'll love her when you get to meet her!"</P><P>"Himeko!" her father cut her off sharply, 
then went on to put it in words, a sour look on his face. "Are you or are you not engaged 
in a homosexual relationship with Himemiya Chikane?"</P><P><I>Oh.</I></P><P>She supposed 
she should have figured it out when her father mentioned "rumors." The same kids who'd seen 
them kissing, who'd spread the rumors through school, might have told their families as 
well. Adults would tell other adults, particularly if this world's Himemiya family was 
anything like that of previous lives. Of course it would be sure to get back to Himeko's 
father.</P><P>"Yes," Himeko answered.</P><P>Eiko's face fell; the spoon handle slipped from 
her fingers and clacked against the side of the pot.</P><P>"My God," her father muttered. 
"So you don't even deny it."</P><P>"Chikane-chan and I love each other!"</P><P>"Love!" 
Hajime protested. "You only met yesterday! How can you be talking about love?"</P><P>"It's 
true," Himeko argued. "We really are in love!" She wished she could explain, but the truth 
about their past lives and their relationship would just sound like nonsense to her 
parents. The Kurusugawas didn't even know of the legend, since they weren't from Mahoroba. 
<I>I wish Chikane-chan was here,</I> Himeko thought helplessly. <I>She'd know what to 
say.</I></P><P>Her father made growling noises, and her mother just sighed.</P><P>"Himeko, 
we know this isn't your fault," Eiko began. "Girls get crushes on other girls sometimes; 
it's a natural part of growing up before you properly find a young man. And we don't 
believe for a moment the things people are saying about you."</P><P>"W-what are they 
saying?" Himeko asked.</P><P>It was her father who answered.</P><P>"The rumor is that you 
seduced the Himemiya girl into this perverted relationship."</P><P>"It's not perverted!" 
Himeko protested.</P><P>"Apparently, she's some kind of school idol, so everyone's talking 
about it, particularly given who her family is."</P><P>"We don't blame you, Himeko," her 
mother said. "To someone rich and beautiful and unscrupulous, a sheltered girl like you 
would be easy prey, but you must see how it would look to outsiders."</P><P>"Stop it!" 
Himeko yelled. "Stop saying those horrible things about Chikane-chan!"</P><P>"You're 
<I>defending</I> her?" Hajime lashed out.</P><P>"She didn't do anything wrong! She didn't 
lure me or seduce me or anything like that!" She turned back to her mother. "And, Okaasan, 
this isn't some crush or temporary fad. I've known for a long time that I like girls 
in...in that way."</P><P>Himeko's mother gasped in shock at this pronouncement. Her father 
slammed the flat of his hand down on the table.</P><P>"Then in essence, you're saying that 
the rumors are correct. Himemiya-san was a normal, innocent girl before she became involved 
with you."</P><P>"Why is it so wrong?" Himeko protested. "We're just like any other couple 
in love. Just because we're both girls—"</P><P>"Do you have any idea what you've done?" he 
roared, and Himeko flinched back. Her reaction obviously caught his attention; he sat back 
in his seat, clenching his teeth as he again tried to leash his anger.</P><P>"H-Himeko," 
her mother stammered. "If this is true, then why didn't you ever tell 
us?"</P><P>"It...wasn't important, Okaasan. I mean, not until now. I wasn't interested in 
dating anybody until I met Chikane-chan, so...I guess I was a little scared?"</P><P>"But 
you're so young. How can you be so certain? Maybe you just haven't met the right boy yet, 
and—"</P><P>Himeko shook her head.</P><P>"No, Mom; it's not a phase. I'm never going to 
want to date a man." It occurred to her that she was technically deceiving her parents on 
this point, since she was bisexual rather than an actual lesbian like Chikane, but the 
statements she was making were the literal truth. Since she had Chikane, she knew and 
always had known she wouldn't want to be in a relationship with any boy, no matter how nice 
or attractive he was.</P><P>"Himeko, you can't know what you're saying, not 
when—"</P><P>"Eiko, that isn't the point now," Himeko's father cut his wife off. "Whether 
Himeko is just experimenting with romance or if she really is...different, that's something 
we can worry about later. The problem is this so-called relationship with 
Himemiya-san."</P><P>"It's not 'so-called'!" Himeko protested.</P><P>"Whatever it is, it 
ends now."</P><P>Himeko stared at him. <I>This can't be happening</I>, she babbled to 
herself. She couldn't understand what was going on.</P><P>"You are to have no contact with 
Himemiya-san other than what is mandated by your teachers at school," he went on 
remorselessly. "You will not speak to her, you will not call her or take calls, you will 
not exchange texts or e-mails, you will not sit together with her or be alone together in 
any way. You will do <I>nothing</I>, do you understand me, that can be construed as you 
having any kind of relationship with her."</P><P>"No!"</P><P>"This is not a discussion, 
Himeko. This is <I>final</I>."</P><P>Himeko's hands tightened on the handle of her school 
bag. Her vision clouded with tears, and it felt like it was hard to breathe, her throat 
glowing close, choked up.</P><P>"No!" Himeko repeated, then unconsciously fell into the 
most common protest, just or not, of a child facing a parental edict. "This isn't fair, to 
say something like that. You don't have any reason for it!"</P><P>Anger rushed back into 
his expression like a thunderbolt, completely consuming it. Himeko couldn't understand why 
he was so angry; it was like facing off against Orochi all over again except this was 
somehow worse, because this was someone she cared for, a man who'd always been there for 
her, supporting and looking out for her as a child. She found that a lot scarier than 
demons or monsters. <I>It's like a nightmare!</I> she quailed.</P><P>"Not <I>fair</I>?" 
Hajime shouted. "No <I>reason</I>? Don't you understand what your little game is doing to 
this family?"</P><P>"I thought...I thought..." Tears were starting to stream down her face, 
but she found her courage. "I thought that my family would be happy that I've found someone 
that I love, someone that loves me back and wants to be with me!"</P><P>"Is your 'love' 
worth seeing this family out in the street?" her father shot back. "Because that's where 
it's going to end up!"</P><P>Himeko gasped, a kind of sick, phlegmy sound because of how 
choked up she was.</P><P>"I don't—"</P><P>"Understand? Of course you don't. You didn't stop 
to think, because all you cared about was your pretty little dream romance. You didn't 
think of how your selfishness would end up hurting other people, did you?"</P><P>"Hajime, 
dear—"</P><P>"No, Eiko. She was the one who said we didn't have any reason, that she didn't 
understand. So I'm going to make sure that she <I>does</I> understand." He turned from his 
wife back to his daughter. "That's what you want, isn't it, Himeko? Or maybe it isn't. 
Maybe it's easier for your little fantasy if your parents are ogres, trying to separate you 
for the fun of it? After all, what's the fun of forbidden love if no one is forbidding 
it?"</P><P>"Hajime!"</P><P>"That isn't it!"</P><P>"Then consider this. Forget the 
embarrassment you'll cause your mother and myself. Forget how hard it is for Shiro to move 
to a new school at his age and make new friends ordinarily, before the entire town knows 
about his sister. Let's just consider the most important point. Why are we here at all? Why 
did we come to Mahoroba in the first place?"</P><P>"Because you...because you got a 
promotion at work," Himeko said between sniffles.</P><P>"And where do I 
work?"</P><P>"K-Kamiyatate Pharmaceutical."</P><P>"Which is a key division of the Himemiya 
Financial Group. Do you understand now, Himeko? Your girlfriend's family owns the company I 
work for. What do you think will happen, with <I>my</I> daughter putting the Himemiya 
heiress's name on every pair of lips in town, making her an object of derision and 
contempt? It's already started. In one day, <I>one day</I> since you met this girl, my 
section chief has already started dropping heavy-handed hints about how the personal 
conduct of employees <I>and their families</I> reflects on the company as a whole. That's 
after a <I>single day</I>, Himeko. This isn't a joking matter or a child's game. If you 
stay on like this, I'm going to lose my job, and for a misconduct discharge, without 
references or recommendations, which will mean I'll very likely never be able to work in my 
profession again. At the very least, we'll lose this house, since we won't be able to make 
the payments on the mortgage. Then there's your future, and that of your brother. Tuition 
at a decent school, to say nothing of college, is expensive. You'll have ruined all of us 
with your little romance. Is that what you want? <I>Is it?</I>"</P><P>Himeko shuddered as 
his words lashed out at her. No wonder her father was so angry—it was fear, plain terror 
for himself and his family, everything he'd worked for, that was driving him. They were 
real fears, too; she'd seen the petty, grasping nature of people in the past. The way 
people like the fangirls from that morning had been contemptuous and resentful of "someone 
like Himeko" being close to Chikane, just for being ordinary. How much worse would it be if 
she did something that so many people actually believed was in and of itself immoral? 
They'd be sure to blame Himeko, and by extension her family. To want to punish the 
Kurusugawas for their "sins."</P><P>Her father was right. All those things <I>could</I> 
happen, if she didn't obey him and let Chikane go. If only she'd known! They'd kept their 
relationship secret in their previous life; they could do it again. Himeko <I>had</I> been 
thoughtless, though. She'd only considered their own happiness, how much she knew Chikane 
had hated hiding it, how much she herself wanted to be able to say it plainly and openly. 
It would serve her right if she had to be separated from Chikane again, a punishment for 
her own selfishness. She ought to obey her father for the whole family's sake.</P><P>But 
she couldn't.</P><P>She could do it to herself, but not to Chikane.</P><P>Chikane had 
sacrificed so much for her, lost her time and again through the ages, wandered lost and 
alone, waded through blood and pain and seen her sanity shattered, been lost in an 
unspeakable despair. <I>I can't...I can't abandon her again. Not even for something 
temporary, a few years. I just promised her yesterday that I wouldn't have any 
regrets.</I></P><P>"I can't!" she sobbed. "I can't do that to Chikane-chan 
again!"</P><P>Her parents gaped at her, speechless. It could have been her refusal—Himeko 
had always been a well-behaved and obedient girl, though with a strongly-developed sense of 
right and wrong. Or if they were paying close attention they might have wondered what she 
meant by "again," when she'd apparently known Chikane for all of one day. They couldn't 
know about fate or destiny or past lives.</P><P>She couldn't betray Chikane. It would be 
like cutting out a piece of her own soul.</P><P><I>But what about my family?</I></P><P>It 
was too much for Himeko. Being caught in the middle like that was a burden she wasn't 
prepared for. Tears streaming down her face, she bolted, running for the 
door.</P><P>"Himeko!" her father shouted, leaping from his chair. "Come back here! 
Himeko!"</P><P>She didn't heed him, though. She rushed through the hall into the foyer, 
wrenched open the door, and ran out of the house into the late-afternoon sun, sun that had 
seemed warm and full of promise but now felt harsh and mocking.</P>
