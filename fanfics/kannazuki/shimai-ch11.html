<p>&quot;Congratulate  me, little brother.&quot;</p>
<p>Minako  looked tired. Perspiration dotted her forehead, dust from the  archives speckled her blouse and skirt, and there were dark circles  under her eyes. But there was also a smug look that Reverend Ohgami  understood all too well; he'd first seen it when they were playing  games as children and she was about to pull off some coup to achieve  victory, and ever since it had invariably marked some triumph on her  part.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh?  What is it?&quot;</p>
<p>She  held up a sheet of paper.</p>
<p>&quot;It  happens to be a list of the eight seals placed on the gods of Yamata  no Orochi.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You...how  did you...?&quot; he exclaimed, his face lighting up.</p>
<p>Minako  grinned at him.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't  underestimate my research skills, Takeshi,&quot; she said with a  chuckle. &quot;After compiling the full list, I started eliminating  sites at the university library, which the Orochi thoughtfully  haven't destroyed yet. That pared it down to fourteen. At that  point I came back here to the shrine archives to finish the job.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why  didn't you start here?&quot; Reverend Ohgami asked curiously.</p>
<p>&quot;Two  reasons. One, we don't have the details about the newer shrines, so  no matter which place I started at there would be red herrings left  over. Two, our organizational system is a bad joke. There's no  easily arranged reference section or card-catalog database or really  any kind of filing system. It was much easier to eliminate the  overlap from there. But I'll do you one better. I know which one  they're going to unseal first.&quot;</p>
<p>The  professor shot her brother a grin, no doubt at the expression of  stunned surprise he could feel forming on his face.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>Kei  Tsujimura wasn't happy. He'd looked all over Mahoroba for the Fifth  Neck without result, and he could only imagine what the First's  response was going to be. <em>Damned  princess</em>,  he thought. <em>Who'd'a  thunk even Orochi cares about birth? And what the hell does she  expect, anyway? It's not like I've got some magic way to track him!</em></p>
<p>It  buzzed at the back of his brain that he <em>should</em> know these things, that the Orochi <em>should</em> be able to seek out one another--and the priestesses besides.</p>
<p><em>Those  damned seals!</em> barked in his mind. Why did this always have to happen to him? Every  time he managed to achieve something in his life he found obstacles  set by others, walls blocking his ability and reason. He had no  chance to succeed--hell, he didn't even have the chance to <em>fail</em>--when  forced to comply with artificial limits put on him by others. He'd  thought that would change when he'd awakened as an Orochi, but it  didn't happen. Sure, he'd showed those bastards who'd snubbed him  who was boss, but now he had completely different goals--and a  completely different set of roadblocks.</p>
<p>At  least this time there were other people working on the problem with  him. Abe might have been looney over the whole end-of-the-world  thing, but he did share a close connection with the will of the god  that might tell him something. And Ozawa might have a stick up his  butt and Reiko might be a princess who wouldn't know <em>real</em> hardship  if it bit her on the ass, but the Seventh and First were both pretty  smart. Maybe they could figure out some way to solve the problem?</p>
<p><em>Not  bloody likely</em>,  he thought with a snort. No, if there was a way, he'd have to find  it himself. If Kei had learned anything in his nineteen years it was  that a man couldn't rely on anybody but himself when the chips were  down. Whether it was a deadbeat father who ran off when he was two,  a drunken mother who could barely wake up before noon, teachers who  just wanted to maintain order in the classroom without giving a damn  about actually teaching, cops who marked someone down as a lost cause  before he was old enough to drink, or crooks who called a man garbage  because he'd made his own way instead of being part of their family,  other people who were at best in the way and at worst actively trying  to keep you down. No, the First, Third, and Seventh would be as  useless as the whore, the painter, and the psycho.</p>
<p><em>Just  like I thought</em>,  he reflected as he reappeared in the shrine of eight gates, <em>not  a damn one of 'em's back.</em> Abe was still playing least-in-sight and Ozawa and Akemi were still  no doubt chasing him all over creation. <em>No  Hirata, either, so at least I haven't been running around after  someone who was sitting here on his ass all along</em>.   The Fourth, too, had apparently given up on trying to solve the  shrine puzzle--<em>like  she'd be able to</em>--and  gone off to whatever it was she did while alone.</p>
<p>Which  was when he saw it.</p>
<p><em>What  the--?</em></p>
<p>He  sprang to the top of the First's prayer gate, landing easily on the  broad stone top. At first, he barely recognized the form huddled  there as Reiko at all. Her clothes were ripped and slashed, smeared  liberally with blood. More than one wound was clearly visible  beneath the slashes, and there were bruises on her face. The top of  the <em>torii</em> around her was smeared with blood--<em>dried</em> blood. Which meant that she must have been like this for hours. <em>How  the hell bad was she hurt?</em> Kei boggled. The power of the Orochi had kept her alive, like it had  when the Lunar Bitch had stabbed the Sixth, but...</p>
<p><em>Damn!  It's like she was taken apart, piece by piece!</em></p>
<p>&quot;Reiko?&quot;  he asked hesitantly. &quot;Hey, First, are you--?&quot; He reached  out to touch her shoulder. <em>Shit!  I'm so bad at this; I've got no idea what to say!</em> Only when his hand tentatively brushed her did she react, first with  a flinch that turned into a shudder, than by looking up. Reiko's  face was a grotesque mask. It was covered in blood, but long streaks  from tears cut through the crusted red-brown stains. &quot;Damn,  First, what happened?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;First?&quot;  she said in an eerie, choking laugh that made Kei shiver. &quot;I'll  never be first...I'll always be nothing but a shadow to her...&quot;</p>
<p>Her  voice trailed off in choking sobs, and the tears began to flow again.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>&quot;Shouldn't  you be in class?&quot; Chikane asked, a little testily. Marika had  stopped by to greet them when Himeko was released from the hospital.</p>
<p>&quot;Can't  think of why. Either you'll lose and the Orochi will destroy the  world, in which case there's no way I want to spend my last few days  listening to lectures, or you'll win and time will reset back to your  birthday, in which case I won't remember anything I learn anyway and  will just have to hear it all over again. So, I'm shamelessly  playing hooky. Besides, if for some weird reason any of this sticks  with me, what you're doing is better practice for my future than what  I learn in class anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  arched an eyebrow. Himeko wished she could do that; she'd always  thought it was a cool expression, not that she ever had occasion to  use it.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't  you remember?&quot; she told her sister. &quot;Marika's going to  take over Ohgami Shrine when her father retires.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Unless  I marry another priest who's better-suited for it,&quot; the  green-haired girl added. &quot;Or unless Aunt Minako decides to keep  a guy for more than six months and their kid wants the job. I mean,  I'm not going to fight tooth-and-nail for it. But it is the family  tradition and...you know, I don't want to back out on tradition.   Especially now that I know from the two of you that it isn't all a  joke but something really important. Geez, I hope I don't forget  that part!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The  Ohgami blood,&quot; Chikane murmured.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>She  surprised Himeko by smiling at Marika.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd  forgotten about that, that your father had been training you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.   Well, it's not like you and I spend a lot of time chatting over our  life's plans, Tsukuyo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  why does that matter?&quot; Himeko asked.</p>
<p>&quot;It  answers a question about something that's been bothering me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's  not an answer!&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  grinned.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes  it is. You're just not asking the right questions.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  pouted, crossing her arms over her chest.</p>
<p>&quot;Geez,  don't be so mean!&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  ruffled her hair. Himeko responded by tilting her head to one side,  opening her eyes as wide as she could, and fluttering her lashes just  a little.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,  all right. I was wondering why she could see my sword when all the  doctors and nurses apparently didn't notice it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The  lethal puppy-dog eyes make even the iciest heart melt! Hey, wait--you  thought I might be an Orochi?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We've  only met two so far. That leaves six unaccounted for.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  not Marika!&quot; Himeko protested.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,  I don't know,&quot; Marika teased. &quot;After all, if the Lunar  Priestess herself can be an Orochi, then anyone might be a valid  suspect. Well, except Hikari.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;True,&quot;  Chikane agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;Um...not  really,&quot; Himeko pointed out.</p>
<p>&quot;Seriously,  Hikari, what could ever make <em>you</em> want to destroy the world?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,  if Chikane had really wanted to do it, I'd have tried to help her  last time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  seem to recall you fighting very hard to stop that,&quot; Chikane  said.</p>
<p>&quot;But  it's not what you wanted! What you were trying to do was to have me  stop the cycles, and all you really <em>wanted</em> was a way we could be together!&quot; She hooked an arm through  Chikane's and leaned up against her shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;I  wonder what the current Orochi really want,&quot; Marika mused, no  doubt changing the subject because things were getting embarrassingly  intimate.</p>
<p>&quot;Honestly,  I don't care,&quot; Chikane said, &quot;unless it helps me to beat  them. Whatever they want, it's not something I'm willing to let them  take.&quot;</p>
<p>Above  them, dark clouds swirled as if called by the prophecy of coming  violence implicit in Chikane's words.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>The  Seventh Neck of Orochi scowled viciously, crumpling his empty drink  cup in his hand before flinging it into a nearby trash can with an  almost convulsive motion. Ozawa had been attempting to find the  missing Third Neck; he hadn't expected to do so sitting at a table in  McDonald's while eating lunch, watching the live news feed on a wall  TV to pass the time.</p>
<p>&quot;Prefectural  police today reported that the body found last night behind the train  station in the town of Mahoroba has been identified as that of  Yuujirou Abe of Kyoto, age 41, a former employee of Niishida Advanced  Design. Sources within the department confirm that they are treating  the suspicious death as a homicide, and are further looking into  possible connections to the recent terrorist attack that left over a  dozen Niishida executives dead. No arrests have yet been announced  in that case, which some have speculated is connected to the Himemiya  Financial Group, which had recently acquired Niishida in...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're  looking angry,&quot; Akemi observed as she returned from the  washroom. Ozawa gestured at the television screen.</p>
<p>&quot;What...that's  Abe!&quot; she gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;Dead,&quot;  he agreed. &quot;Let's go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,  we should tell--&quot;</p>
<p>He  shook his head.</p>
<p>&quot;No,  I don't mean go back. Just somewhere more private, where we can talk  without being overheard.&quot;</p>
<p>That  was not to say that he wasn't willing to lash out, to destroy  everyone within range if, say, someone had recognized his face and  started screaming for the police. It was just that such actions were  a distraction to his goals; sowing random chaos for its own sake held  no appeal for him. Destruction would come at the end of it all, once  the priestesses were dead and Orochi summoned. While he understood  how some of the others had required the visceral pleasure of settling  their personal scores at once, Ozawa himself did not. For him, it  was enough to know that the rot would all be blown away in the  purifying wind of Yamata no Orochi.</p>
<p>Or  maybe he was fooling himself. Maybe it had nothing to do with a  disciplined will and goal-oriented mind. Maybe it was just that he  didn't know the names and faces of those who'd wronged him.</p>
<p>They  left the restaurant and walked down the street, then turned up a side  lane that led away from the shopping district. Within a couple of  blocks they were walking past neat little houses all in a row behind  which, no doubt, suburban families lived. Were they in blissful  ignorance of what was to come? Or were they, too, living out their  own misery, their hearts yearning for ultimate destruction the way  those called by Orochi were?</p>
<p>&quot;Surrounded  by people and yet alone,&quot; Akemi said. &quot;How different it is  from the city, where every breath of air is choked with someone  else's sweat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The  air may be cleaner,&quot; Ozawa decided, &quot;but the people are  just as foul.&quot; The First Neck had grown up in Mahoroba, after  all, and had ended up as malice-wracked as any of them.</p>
<p>Akemi  was silent for a moment, then apparently chose not to extend the  conversation, instead returning to the relevant point.</p>
<p>&quot;So,  Abe is dead?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's  what the broadcast reported,&quot; Ozawa agreed. &quot;They said he  was found last night behind the train station. Since he'd had a job,  a family, a place in society, I'm not surprised that the police were  able to identify his body. What they couldn't know is <em>how</em> he was killed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As  Orochi, we <em>can't</em> die so long as we are sheltered by the power of our gods,&quot; Akemi  agreed, speaking not only from knowledge but personal experience.   &quot;To kill Abe, his murderer had to first disrupt the Shadow of Hi  no Ashinazuchi, then strike his supernaturally-enhanced body down.   One of the priestesses, no doubt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps?&quot;</p>
<p>Ozawa  rubbed his chin thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&quot;The  last we saw of Abe, he was remaining within the shrine of Orochi to  commune with the dark god while we searched for the shrines sealing  our gods. There is no guarantee this is all that he did, of course.   For one example, he may have been given the location of the Solar  Priestess, went at once to confront her, and been destroyed for his  haste. But if he <em>did</em> remain within the shrine bounds...&quot;</p>
<p>The  clouds above were as dark and threatening as those that swirled  endlessly above the gates of the Orochi.</p>
<p>&quot;The  priestesses wouldn't be able to follow. Is that what you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.   And besides the priestesses, only a fellow Orochi would have the  power to kill one of us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  who? And why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's  pure speculation at best. But now I understand Yamata no Orochi's  anger at our last gathering. It was not at the speed of our  progress, but at Abe's death--and possibly at the treachery of his  slayer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What  do we do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Watch  carefully. Do not leave ourselves unguarded. And strike when the  moment is right. Thus far I have been content to follow the First's  lead, but now it is clear that I take a more active role. The Necks  must unite to accomplish their purpose rather than running to and fro  willy-nilly.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>Hirata  could taste the storm on the wind, the heaviness like water in the  air that seemed to cling to his body, the ozone of electricity  against his tongue promising lightning to come. Yes, a storm was  brewing over Mahoroba, and he would be at the eye of it.</p>
<p>&quot;There  you are. I was getting tired of waiting.&quot;</p>
<p>The  black hawk opened its beak and let loose a keening cry. The one on  whose shoulder it perched reached up and gentled it, stroking its  shadowy feathers.</p>
<p>&quot;Yokusemi  no Mizuchi is restless, too. Perhaps he should be your Shadow,  rather than mine,&quot; the Eighth Neck reflected.</p>
<p>&quot;Ho  no Shuraizuchi suits me fine. It goes with my nature.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As  all the gods do with their bearers. These calls do not come by  accident,&quot; Hirata's companion agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;So,  all your watching and waiting has paid off, then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Patience  is a weapon. The best time to destroy your enemies is when they  believe they are acting of their own free will. Reiko chose to  attack the Lunar Priestess out of emotion, not foresight, and paid  for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  thought it was just luck she got away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not  her first attack. I'm referring to last night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Last  night?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dear  Reiko felt the need to appear to her former crush. I believe it was  out of some craving to show off how much she'd grown and changed  since becoming an Orochi. It, shall we say...did not go well. With  a few cutting remarks the Lunar Priestess goaded her into a fight and  then proceeded to carve Reiko apart. Now that she has awakened to  her true self she is no longer so weak. Before, she was as strong as  one of us without our gods. Now, she is as strong as one of us <em>with</em> our Shadows, and quite certainly more skilled than most.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is  Reiko alive?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Barely.   Though by now no doubt her body has largely repaired itself.&quot;   The Eighth Neck smiled. &quot;As for her mind, well, we'll see. I  must say that Tsukuyo Asamiya would make an excellent Orochi. Such  calculated cruelty is rather impressive.&quot;</p>
<p>Hirata  felt his gut churn.</p>
<p>&quot;And  we're--&quot;</p>
<p>His  counterpart laughed, and he wished that he had some of his fellow  Necks' confidence. Hirata was certain that unlike Reiko's veneer of  strength, a newly gained and therefore fragile thing, the Eighth's  confidence was an old friend.</p>
<p>Which  was why he'd chosen to throw his lot in this alliance, rather than  with the other six.</p>
<p>&quot;Please  keep calm. But I have to say, I admire your intuition. We do in  fact have to confront her. What we do <em>not</em> have to do is kill her or even force a retreat. We need one thing  and one thing only: her blood.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Her...<em>blood</em>?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly.   That is the key. I really can't think how we could have overlooked  it for so long.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  don't understand,&quot; Hirata admitted.</p>
<p>&quot;To  unseal the ultimate power of Orochi, it is necessary to ritually shed  the blood of a pure priestess. These eight seals that inhibit us now  are only lesser versions of the same seal, the same magic from the  same source. It is <em>barely</em> possible that multiple Orochi, perhaps even all eight, could break  the seal through sheer power, but to unlock it requires the blood of  a priestess. Spill her blood, and we have the key to break the  seal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Even  so, it's dangerous...&quot;</p>
<p>Hirata  flinched and fell silent when the other Neck's gaze turned scornful.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  sorry,&quot; he apologized.</p>
<p>&quot;No;  your concern is valid, particularly as I just spent the time to  impress upon you how frightening an opponent the Lunar Priestess can  be. If you intended to fight her one-on-one to the death, your  concern would be more than justified. Which is why we aren't going  to do that. We will fight together, two against one, and by luring  her into an ambush we can guarantee that we get what we want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An  ambush? But how can you bait her into doing what you want?&quot;  Hirata was starting to feel bothered by his own confusion. The gap  in terms of knowledge was simply too broad for the artist to fool  himself into thinking that he was the Eighth's partner or ally. He  was the other Orochi's minion, no more, his purpose solely to provide  additional power to carry out the Eighth Neck's plans.</p>
<p><em>But  how is that different from following the orders of the First or  Seventh, except that Reiko and Ozawa lack the Eighth's wisdom?  There's no shame in listening to those with actual knowledge, only in  submitting to fools.</em></p>
<p>So  he listened patiently to how the Lunar Priestess would be brought to  sow the seeds of her own annihilation, and the world's doom.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>Thunder  rumbled from the clouds outside. Chikane glanced out the window and  saw the way the clouds swirled cruelly. There was a storm  threatening, she thought, a harsh one that made what Reverend Ohgami  was telling her somehow fitting.</p>
<p>&quot;I  wish that I could say that there would be a respite for you, after  the ritual of unsealing and your battle with Reiko Himemiya  yesterday, but--&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  waved his concern away.</p>
<p>&quot;There  will be respite enough for me when this month is over,&quot; she  pointed out. &quot;Until then I shall simply have to try my best.   We both have our duties, after all.&quot;</p>
<p>He  nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;That  of the Ohgami being to support the priestesses in their work, as we  have in this case--though it is all bad news, I fear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  that I can do something about.&quot;</p>
<p>He  nodded again.</p>
<p>&quot;I  hope that it is possible.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So  what is it?&quot; she asked bluntly.</p>
<p>&quot;While  we still have made no progress concerning the identity of the Solar  Priestess, we have been able to learn more about the seals on the  Orochi gods. Minako was able to discover the location of the shrines  which seal them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  impressed by Professor Ohgami's research skills,&quot; she said  sincerely.</p>
<p>&quot;The  problem is, if we are correct, the Orochi will move to break one of  those seals tonight. Timing is important as we move through the  month; if they fail tonight it will be another three days before they  can try again to unseal a shrine through proper ritual.&quot; He  paused and stroked his chin. &quot;My fear is that should they  succeed even this once, then ritual and timing won't matter.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  nodded back.</p>
<p>&quot;I  understand. Not only would it mean that one of the Orochi would be  fully free, but if that one is willing to work with the others he or  she could simply tear open the shrines through brute force. It's a  miracle that the seals have continued to exist this long&quot;--<em>a  miracle, or a testament to the purity of Himeko's spirit that the  world she built wouldn't have enough malice to shatter those  bonds--</em>&quot;so  it's impossible that they could last against the full power of an  Orochi god. But even one would be more than I could face, alone and  without the power of Ame no Murakumo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That  was what I thought.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  if there are eight shrines, do you know which one they'll start  with?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Minako  thinks that they have to start at one end of the chain or the other,  with Take no Sukunazuchi or Yokusemi no Mizuchi.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is  it necessary that the corresponding Neck be the one to perform the  ritual?&quot;</p>
<p>Ohgami  thought about that.</p>
<p>&quot;I  honestly can't say, though it certainly sounds reasonable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In  that case, we'll begin with the seal for the Eighth Neck's god.&quot;   She found herself smiling as she added, &quot;I don't believe Reiko  will be in any condition to perform rituals tonight. I presume that  Professor Ohgami was able to identify which shrine was which?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thankfully,  yes.&quot; He took a folded list from his kimono sleeve, checked it,  and gave her the address.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd  better leave now, then,&quot; she said. &quot;May I borrow your car,  Reverend?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of  course.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank  you. I'll go tell Himeko.&quot;</p>
<p>She  turned to leave, but was stopped in mid-motion by the priest's sharp  voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Tsukuyo!  You can't be thinking of bringing your sister with you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She  was just released from the hospital today! She's in no condition to  be going out and fighting Orochi.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,  I--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Please,  I--&quot; he cut her off, then sighed heavily, letting his head sag.   &quot;Tsukuyo, I'm not saying this as a priest or as an Ohgami, but  as a father. I know that Hikari is your twin sister, and that beyond  that fact you share a bond I can only begin to understand from past  lives, but she's also my daughter's best friend. Through that I've  come to know and care for her. I'm just afraid that if you keep  trying to act as if she still is what she used to be that next time  she won't be as lucky as she was yesterday.&quot;</p>
<p>She  turned away from him so she wouldn't have to see his face, his  concern both touching and appalling.</p>
<p><em>What  she used to be.</em></p>
<p>Every  time she tried to set it aside, it came back to her again. Chikane  was going to go out and fight the Orochi, and she could barely see  the point, not when the ruin of her existence stared her in the face.</p>
<p>&quot;Why  are you saying this to me? Why not to her?&quot; she asked softly.</p>
<p>&quot;Because  she follows where you lead. If you didn't ask, she wouldn't go along  into danger.&quot;</p>
<p>Thunder  rumbled again, this time accompanied by a bolt of lightning that cast  the room in stark white for an instant. Chikane found her lips  curving upwards in a smile heavy with irony.</p>
<p>&quot;You  really don't understand us at all, do you?&quot;</p>
<p>She  began to walk towards the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Tsukuyo--&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  stopped, resting her head on the jamb and looked back over her  shoulder at the priest.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't  worry, Reverend Ohgami. I'm not going to have her come along. I'm  only keeping a promise to tell her what I'm doing tonight. She won't  let me protect her from that knowledge, you see.&quot;</p>
<p>He  looked at her, obviously confused.</p>
