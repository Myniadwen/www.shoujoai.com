the secret garden love scene from Part II. 


**********************************************************************


The teasingly light floral scent, and the moist softness cool against 
her lips, tells Chikane that it is the petals of a blooming rose that 
her lover is tenderly touching against her face. A shiver meanders up 
Chikane&#39;s back as she sighs contently, twisting her head upwards to try 
and follow the tantalizing sensation. She lifts her hand to try to 
catch the flower. 

&quot;Himeko...&quot;

&quot;Shh...&quot; Her lover whispers, even as the petals continue to leave 
tingling anticipation upon her skin. 

&quot;Don&#39;t speak...&quot;

Himeko&#39;s breath is warm against Chikane&#39;s ear...

&quot;Don&#39;t move...&quot;

... her voice is low...

&quot;Just...&quot;

... her words are soft...

&quot;Be...&quot;

... her commands tremble with sweet promise...

&quot;Mine.&quot;

... and Chikane can do naught but obey. 

A quiet shudder leaves her lips as she feels Himeko drag the rose down 
her throat, over her collar bone, and further, further downwards... 
after shadows of the flower&#39;s trail leaves her skin feeling almost cold 
against the night&#39;s breeze - such a ravishing contrast to the pulsating 
heat she feels inside her body. 

Wholly vulnerable and defenseless... she is at Himeko&#39;s complete mercy. 
Will her lover be kind or cruel? 

Another shiver traverses her flesh. Chikane doesn&#39;t know which one she 
prefers.  

She wonders what Himeko is feeling right now. Her lover&#39;s chosen tool 
of seduction is a poor instrument of communication for Himeko&#146;s own 
bodily desires, though the rose announces to Chikane&#146;s flesh the will 
and intent of the fingers that grasp it, like a paintbrush does to 
canvas an artisan&#39;s vision.

Absorbed as she is in the spell her lover is weaving, Chikane fails to 
notice when the flower takes leave of her body, and can only just 
barely make out the soft crunching of Himeko&#39;s bare feet on grass.

She hears Himeko circling around her silently once... twice... and 
though she cannot see so herself, she knows that the moon shines 
brightly in Himeko&#39;s eyes. It illuminates a hunger in those orchid 
depths, a hunger that is normally hidden underneath layers of docile 
sweetness and kind innocence, but one so deep and powerful that just 
the memory of it almost sends Chikane crumbling to the ground in 
submission.

She hears Himeko stopping behind her, and then, for a terrible second, 
when Himeko continues to remain silent, she cannot feel her lover&#39;s 
presence at all. 

Her heart begins to race as the perfect images in her mind&#39;s eye begin 
to fade, and unending darkness rapidly converges upon her from all 
directions. 

She is overwhelmed. Fear grips her heart, as the memory of eternal 
solitude floods into her mind - memories of a great wooden gate closing 
with a booming finality, memories of kneeling in complete darkness, 
memories of an eon of silent penance... 

She opens her mouth to cry out, but before she can be swallowed up by 
her blindness, she feels something warm upon her neck. 

And suddenly, mercifully, vision returns to Chikane, as Himeko&#39;s touch 
upon her flesh allows her to draw her beloved&#39;s form in her mind with 
loving colours once more.  

Himeko rescues her with gentle kisses just at the point of panic.
Chikane feels as though the strength in her body has bled from her. 
&quot;H...Himeko...&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m here, Chikane-chan. I&#39;m here...&quot;

Her knees are shaking and she wants to melt to the earth, but steady 
hands upon her waist support her. She feels Himeko&#39;s breath upon her 
neck as her lover pauses, before brushing trembling lips against 
Chikane&#39;s ears. Himeko&#39;s hands remain around Chikane&#39;s body until 
Chikane is sure her legs can support her. Then they dance upwards, 
fingers lightly brushing up the sides of Chikane&#39;s stomach, her bosom, 
before slipping underneath the straps of her plunging neckline dress, 
and slowly - oh so maddeningly slowly - pulling them off of her shaking 
shoulders.

Chikane can feel the fabric of her dress moving across her skin. She 
can&#39;t help but hold her breath as the slinky material slips over her 
breasts, exposing them to the cool night air, before Himeko has the 
straps off her shoulders, and the dress falls quietly to her feet 
entirely. 

The moon sends a passing zephyr against her, and Chikane begins to 
tremble from the cold. She feels Himeko press up against her back in 
response, gently cupping her breasts in gentle hands, holding her, 
caressing her, warming her kindly. 

Himeko&#39;s hands are at times delicate and at times eager, but always 
attentive, and responsive to the wordless pleas and cries that escape 
Chikane&#39;s lips. They roam across her body, showering her flesh with 
lavish consideration. Thumbs and fingers tease and arouse her nipples 
almost to the point of pain. Palms rove across her stomach, her navel, 
her hips, and advance downwards still. They slow - infuriatingly so - 
just at the edge of her panties, and stop altogether.

Himeko&#39;s breathing is steady, but Chikane can feel the pounding of her 
lover&#39;s heart against her back, and she knows her beloved wears an 
expression of anticipation as well.

The tension in her heart and in her lower body is overbearing. Chikane 
gives a murmur of disapproval. What is Himeko waiting for?      

Then she feels a hand sliding across her tummy. One soft tug and twist 
later, and the warmth of Himeko&#39;s body is now in front of at her &#150; at 
her face, her chest, her stomach... 

Only a thin piece of satin separates them, and Chikane can easily feel 
Himeko&#39;s warmth if not her flesh directly. Himeko&#39;s hands, resting upon 
Chikane&#146;s hips, slowly direct Chikane&#39;s lower body into a rhythmic 
rocking against her own body. As they dance, the silky smoothness 
sliding back and forth upon her drives Chikane almost to the point of 
madness.   

Knees buckling and breathing ragged, she can barely take anymore, and 
almost cries out in relief when her lover finally allows her to sink to 
the earth. 

Chikane is intently aware of the coolness of the ground upon her back, 
the prickly points of grass against her flesh. She is also very 
conscious of her lover&#39;s fingers hooking onto her panties, and how 
mortifyingly moist they are as they are deftly pulled off of her 
legs... 

Now clad in absolutely nothing, save for the piece of fabric around her 
eyes, Chikane is keenly, _keenly_ aware of her exposure, especially as 
her lover is still fully clothed. 

She tries to slow her anxious breathing, tries to stop her anticipation 
from making a fool of her, tries to curl up into a tiny, protective 
ball, but Himeko will have none of that.

Her lover gently takes her wrists and pulls her arms over her head, 
causing Chikane to arch her back, thrusting her chest upwards as she is 
laid out for all the world of night and moonlight to see. She hears 
Himeko give a sharp intake of breath, and feels her lover&#39;s grip on her 
wrists slacken. Chikane turns her head minutely to the general 
direction of her beloved&#39;s sudden lack of breath. 
 
&quot;... Himeko?&quot; She asks softly, curiously.

Her lover does not answer her right away.

Chikane crinkles her brow in worry. &quot;Himeko?&quot; She presses. 

What can possibly be the matter?

Finally, she hears Himeko stir, swallowing audibly, and she feels 
trembling fingers brushing her hair from her face.

&quot;... you&#39;re glowing, Chikane-chan,&quot; Himeko whispers hoarsely. &quot;... 
you&#39;re... so... beautiful...!&quot;

Himeko&#146;s words drip with desire and longing. Her earnest declaration 
causes the heat to rise in Chikane&#39;s cheeks once more, and Chikane 
shyly turns away. She feels Himeko&#39;s fingers firmly taking her chin, 
turning her attention back. 

Himeko kisses her sweetly, gently at first, but the sweetness soon 
melts away to eagerness and unadulterated _need_. Himeko&#39;s kisses trail 
down her throat, down the valley of her bosom, down her stomach, her 
belly button, down, down, down, further and further...  

Her beloved opens her, and partakes of her. 

Chikane moans and grasps uselessly at the earth, trying desperately not 
to thrash, not to beg, not to whimper, to retain some semblance of 
dignity. But control slips further and further away as Himeko&#39;s mouth 
continues to sample her, taste her, savor her, and Himeko&#146;s tongue 
continues to swirl upon her flesh, deeper and deeper... 

The tension in her body builds, and builds, and builds further 
still...!

And just when she feels that she can stand it no longer, Himeko grants 
her sweet, merciful release, and Chikane&#39;s cries of triumph and 
pleasure echo into the night.


***


It takes her what feels like an eternity to recover, before Chikane can 
trust her body not to spasm uncontrollably. She feels the heat of 
bashfulness rising in her cheeks as she realizes that she is clinging 
like an infant to her lover, hands gripping the satin of Himeko&#39;s 
dress, head buried in Himeko&#39;s chest, her entire body still trembling 
like a leaf, even as she wills - implores, pleads, begs, - her heart to 
stop racing.

Himeko patiently strokes the back of her head, holding her close and 
softly cooing sweet nothings. There is an unmistakably amused and 
satisfied undertone in those gentle sounds, and Chikane can&#39;t help but 
feel her blush deepen. 

Himeko has every right to be pleased with herself; like a finely tuned 
instrument, Chikane has responded to her musician&#39;s commands.  

A small smile comes onto Chikane&#39;s face. She will allow Himeko to bask 
for a while longer, before reminding her lover who the maestro really 
was.

AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE AND OMAKE!

And that finishes it up! I&#39;m relieved that Blinded is done, and didn&#39;t 
end up in the pile of &#39;discontinued fics&#39;, but on the other hand, I 
feel 
kinda empty now. I&#39;ve just finished watching the last DVD (just as 
goooooood as I remember it to be) too, and that really didn&#39;t 
help... :( &lt;hopes this feeling will go away soon&gt;

First limes, then lemons, now PWPs... *sigh* &#39;Finally Healing&#39; and 
&#39;Blinded&#39; have started me down a very slippery slope...

Thank you very much for reading, and I hope this was a satisfactory 
bonus 0.5 chapter. I sort of already poured my heart out in the notes 
at the end of Part III, so I don&#39;t have too much more to say, except 
that muse-chan&#39;s given me another image that I can&#39;t seem to shake, so 
the probability of another fic set in this universe aren&#39;t so low... 
^_~  

As always, many thanks to Naolin and Eimii! 

Cheers,

Jen-chan

OMAKE I:  Tastefully Depicted

&lt;CHIKANE &amp; HIMEKO sit at a table. They are reading the script for Part 
III.5, and trying to decide if it meets the &#39;tastefully depicted&#39; 
clause of their contracts. HIMEKO holds the papers in her lap while 
CHIKANE&#39;S face is obscured by her script&gt;

HIMEKO: &lt;Turns the final sheet. Blushing furiously&gt; So... what do you 
think? 

CHIKANE: ...

HIMEKO: &lt;pushes fingers together, still blushing&gt; I... I think... over 
all, it&#39;s not _too_ trashy... and... it doesn&#39;t feel like 
exploitation... 

CHIKANE: ...

HIMEKO: It&#39;s a little OOC... &lt;shrinks in on herself in embarrassment&gt; I 
mean... I don&#39;t think I could ever... I mean, more skillfully than 
Chikane-chan.... like... that... but... over all... um... I think... I 
think I can... approve... 

CHIKANE: ...

HIMEKO: ... Chikane-chan? &lt;growing more anxious&gt;

CHIKANE: ...

HIMEKO: Mou, Chikane-chan, why won&#39;t you say anything? &lt;pulls the 
script away from CHIKANE&gt;

&lt;A massive GEYSER of blood erupts from CHIKANE&#39;S nose and totally coats 
HIMEKO in red fluid&gt;

CHIKANE: &lt;falls weakly to the floor&gt; ...

HIMEKO: ... I&#39;ll take that as your approval.</pre>
