**********************************************************************


Miyahime Chikane awoke in the morning feeling frustratingly 
disoriented. Her head was heavy with a jumble of imagery, thoughts, 
memories and dreams, and for the life of her, she couldn&#39;t tell where 
one ended and the next began. She rolled over, blindly groping for 
Kurusugawa Himeko, before remembering that the love of her life had 
gone away for the weekend. The pang of heartache that seized her chest, 
though wholly unpleasant, finally managed to give her some focus, 
leading her out of the misty maze of sleep. 

Firmly in the land of the living, Chikane sighed softly and put her 
head back down on the pillows, inhaling deeply. She could still smell 
of Himeko faintly on the bed linens - had they not been changed 
yesterday? How characteristically omniscient and considerate of Otoha-
san to leave her this kind reminder... 

Chikane allowed herself a few more moments of sweet indulgence before 
finally summoning the will to leave her bed. After a few tries, she 
found the alarm clock and pushed a button.

&quot;It is 10:37 AM.&quot;

The pianist frowned. How had she managed to sleep in so late? 
Hurriedly, she found her way to the bathroom to prepare herself for the 
day.

Sometime after stepping out of the shower and putting her hair up in a 
towel, she heard a knock at her bedroom door. &quot;Come in,&quot; she called, 
and heard the door open and Otoha bidding her good morning.

&quot;Good morning, Otoha-san. Did you rest well?&quot; She detected a distinctly 
noticeable hesitancy in her loyal maid&#39;s pause before the woman 
answered in regular tones.

&quot;Y-yes, Ojou-sama... I had a... restful... night. Thank you. Please 
sit, there&#39;s a chair to your left.&quot; Otoha said haltingly. Chikane 
didn&#39;t believe the other woman for a second, but decided against 
calling her maid on it; when Otoha-san felt comfortable, Chikane 
thought the woman would divulge her mind. 

Sitting down in the chair, she felt Otoha-san unwrap the towel from her 
head and start drying her hair, gently massaging her scalp. 

&quot;There were several messages left by Kurusugawa-sama late last night 
and earlier this morning. Shall I bring you the phone after we&#39;re 
finished?&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot; Chikane cried, far too quickly to be polite as she felt her 
heart leap into her throat. She had half a mind to just tell her maid 
to stop and bring her the phone now. &quot;What did she say?&quot;

&quot;She wanted to apologize for the lack of communication. The train was 
late due to an accident on the rails, and her cell phone had run out of 
batteries. She was picked up safely, and spent the night with Oogami 
Souma-sama&#39;s family. She apologizes that she may not be able to phone 
again until later today after the ceremony, as the preparations have, 
in her words, &#39;developed a mind of its own and is trying to eat us 
all&#39;.&quot;

Basking in the afterglow of the message, Chikane felt her heart warm. 
So the dearth of communication from Himeko had not been an ominous 
sign, after all. She felt rather silly, and internally berated herself 
for having such little faith in her lover.

Otoha continued to speak. &quot;Ojou-sama, I hope you do not mind, but as 
you hadn&#39;t provided me with the day&#39;s itinerary, I...&quot; Her voice took 
on nervous tones. &quot;... I took the liberty of arranging your day&#39;s plans 
for you.&quot;

Chikane was initially taken aback. That was bold of her maid - was this 
why she&#39;d been so nervous earlier? But the more she thought about it, 
the more she came to appreciate her maid&#39;s consideration. It wasn&#39;t 
like she had a tight schedule to keep anymore, after all. &quot;Not at all, 
Otoha-san. Thank you very much for your initiative. What&#39;s first on the 
agenda?&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Ojou-sama.&quot; Otoha&#39;s voice became firmer, but still held a 
lilt of anxiety. &quot;As it is getting late in the morning, I told Chef you 
would not be requiring breakfast and have made reservations at Diego&#39;s 
instead.&quot;

Chikane quirked an eyebrow. Diego was one of her favourite cafes... 
whenever she traveled to Shizuoka, that was. &quot;Diego&#39;s?&quot; She asked 
pointedly.

&quot;Yes, Ojou-sama. It&#39;s on the way. I thought... I thought we might join 
Kurusugawa-sama at Saotome-sama and Oogami-sama&#39;s wedding.&quot;

There was a very pregnant silence in the bathroom. Chikane felt Otoha&#39;s 
ministrations slow down, and stop.

&quot;I... I&#39;m very sorry, Ojou-sama, if I have displeased you. I realize 
the doctor&#39;s orders were that you are to rest and to not partake in any 
stressful activities, but...&quot; Otoha&#39;s voice grew soft. &quot;... but I think 
it would be more stressful for you _not_ to go.&quot;

The silence continued on for a few more moments, making the bathroom 
seem suddenly cold and chilling. 

Yes... her maid was right. Staying home was infinitely more 
distressing. And, if she never did regain her vision, did it mean she 
would never regain her life? Remain forever trapped in her house?

Chikane shifted in her chair, nodding. She smiled unsurely. &quot;Thank you, 
Otoha-san.&quot; She said softly. &quot;You are very thoughtful.&quot;

Chikane heard Otoha-san released the breath she&#39;d been holding, and the 
whole room felt suddenly warmer. After a brief pause of relief, the 
maid tentatively began to knead away the moisture from Chikane&#39;s hair 
again.


***


Standing at the beginning of the wedding party progression line with 
Morimoto Yukihito, the Best Man, beside her, Himeko made sure that the 
smile plastered on her face hadn&#39;t slipped as she thanked the next 
guests that had arrived for the reception for coming. 

The guests would then glide past two more sets of bridesmaids and 
groomsmen, before they hit Oogami Kazuki and Saotome Tsubuki and 
Nadoka, guardians of the Bride and Groom, before, of course, finally 
being able to offer congratulations to the man and woman of the hour 
themselves, Oogami Souma and Makoto. It was Yukihito and Himeko&#39;s duty 
to put on the best, most welcoming faces.

In truth, Himeko didn&#39;t really feel up to the task, though there was no 
way she&#39;d let her best friend know that. She couldn&#39;t put the worry out 
of her mind. She&#39;d left half a dozen messages for Chikane in the last 
two days. Why hadn&#39;t Chikane-chan called her back yet?

&quot;Misaki-chan! Thanks for coming!&quot; Yukihito said warmly, shaking a 
short, plump woman&#39;s hand, jolting Himeko out of her trance. Hastily, 
Himeko came back to reality and smiled as sweetly as she could at the 
guest, inclining her head politely in greeting.

Snap out of it! Come on, it&#39;s Mako-chan&#39;s and Souma-kun&#39;s wedding! You 
have to do your best for them!

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Himeko-san,&quot; Yukihito whispered conspiratorially as he 
leaned down to her ear. &quot;It&#39;s tiring, but I think almost everyone&#39;s 
here now. Hang in there! We&#39;ll be able to drink ourselves silly soon!&quot;

The blonde woman blushed, slightly mortified that she&#39;d been caught, 
and relieved that Yukihito was so kind. Eagerly, she greeted the next 
set of guests.

Busy forcing herself to be engrossed in her task, Himeko didn&#39;t 
actually see Chikane enter into the dining hall so much as _feel_ her.  
She wasn&#39;t sure what it was, but something in the air told her to look 
up and over, and as she did so, she saw the most gorgeous woman in the 
room walking slowly but steadily towards her, supported at the elbow by 
another woman wearing a brown wrap-around dress and matching short 
blazer.

Himeko felt the smile on her face grow wide and genuine as she took in 
the sight of the love of her life. Beside her, she felt Yukihito 
stiffen, and then whistle lowly under his breath. She had to agree with 
him.

Chikane wore a metallic grey dress with a plunging neckline. The dress 
shimmered faintly under the lights above, clinging sensually to her 
body, and hanging from her hips to the floor in a smooth, slim, 
sophisticated flourish. Her blue-black hair had been pulled up into a 
sexy, messy bun. She wore a luxurious yet simple diamond necklace with 
matching earrings and bracelet, and three-inch, strappy grey heels. Her 
blindfold, made from the same material as her dress, was more than 
large enough to cover up the unsightly medical gauze that should have 
been wrapped around her head. It didn&#39;t quite cover her eyebrows, and 
hung down almost to mid-cheek. It gave her a mysteriously playful, yet 
debonair air.

&quot;Who is that?&quot; Yukihito breathed. Or rather, he looked like he had 
difficulty breathing.

Himeko smiled understandingly up at him. &quot;Miyahime Chikane. My 
girlfriend.&quot; And with that she hurriedly ran out to greet her. 

&quot;Chikane-chan!!&quot;

The stunning woman turned in the direction of Himeko&#39;s voice. 
&quot;Himeko?&quot; She reached out tentatively with one hand. 

Himeko squeezed it tightly in one of her own, throwing the other one 
around Chikane&#39;s waist in an embrace. Stretching up on her toes, she 
brushed her lips lightly against Chikane&#39;s own, and felt the other 
woman respond contently in kind. Himeko&#39;s heart was beating wildly in 
her chest with pleased excitement. &quot;I can&#39;t believe it... You came!&quot; 

And then the implications of that statement jogged her out of her 
happiness, and hastily, she unhanded her lover&#39;s slender waist, though 
she still kept a tight grip on Chikane&#39;s hand. &quot;Is everything alright? 
Is it safe? Should you be here?&quot; She glanced over at the woman beside 
Chikane and almost boggled when she placed Otoha-san. She almost hadn&#39;t 
recognized the woman without her apron and uniform. 

Chikane laughed, sounding like bells. Beside her, Otoha gave Himeko a 
tight smile. &quot;Everything is fine, Himeko. I just have to be careful. 
And, I most definitely should be here. With you.&quot; 

The blonde woman felt flutters in her heart, and knew that her smile 
was going to split her face in two with its brilliant size. She 
couldn&#39;t quite voice her pleasure, and could only shyly look down at 
her shoes. She felt Chikane squeeze her hand back, and she knew, 
somehow, that the other woman understood her feelings. 

&quot;Come on, Chikane-chan! I have to introduce you to Souma-kun and Mako-
chan! Oh, they&#39;ve wanted to meet you for so long!&quot; Himeko gently took 
Chikane&#39;s elbow, and looked across at Otoha. &quot;Thank you for bringing 
her, Otoha-san!&quot; She gave the maid a dazzling, heartfelt smile. &quot;Come 
on, just this way!&quot;

The woman smiled - an oddly melancholy expression - and shook her head, 
releasing the hold she had at Chikane&#39;s other side. &quot;It&#39;s alright, 
Kurusugawa-sama. I&#39;m not a guest at this reception, and have made plans 
to visit my previous employer. Ojou-sama, is it alright if I took my 
leave now?&quot;

&quot;Yes, if you so desire. Thank you for all your hard work, Otoha-san. 
Please enjoy your night.&quot; The tall woman (made that much taller by her 
heels), gave her maid an appreciative nod.

&quot;I will, Ojou-sama. Thank you.&quot; Otoha turned to go, before stopping and 
then looking back. She caught Himeko&#39;s eyes full on, and Himeko was 
surprised to see those amber eyes cloudy and unreadable. &quot;Please take 
care of Ojou-sama tonight, Kurusugawa-sama. I leave her in your care.&quot;

Himeko started at the solemnity of Otoha&#39;s words, before her eyes set 
in determination. She nodded. &quot;Of course.&quot;

With one final look over her shoulder, Otoha took leave of the hall.

The blonde Maid of Honor looked confusedly after the maid had left - 
what had that been about? - before turning her attention back onto her 
lover. A look at Chikane-chan, and all confusion fled her mind. Still 
smiling and feeling at the same time shy, pleased and proud, Himeko 
walked Chikane over to meet her best friends.

They made it through the other wedding party members until they stood 
in front of Makoto and Souma. Both bride and groom looked surprised for 
a moment, before recovering. Makoto grinned, a wide, stupid grin that 
was very true to her character, and totally at odds with the chic, 
stylish, strapless white wedding gown she wore. She gave Chikane a hug, 
stepping up on her tippy-toes to give the blue-black haired woman a 
reciprocating kiss on the cheek.

&quot;I&#39;m so glad to finally meet you, Chikane-san!&quot; Makoto cried happily. 
&quot;That is a gorgeous dress!&quot;

&quot;Ara, you&#39;ve taken my lines from me,&quot; Chikane replied kindly. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry for my lateness. I hope it was a beautiful ceremony?&quot;

&quot;It was!&quot; Makoto beamed. She nudged Souma in the ribs. &quot;I wasn&#39;t a big 
fan of the idea of a traditional Shinto wedding, but when you&#39;re 
marrying the second son of the largest shrine in town, there&#39;s no 
getting away from that, eh!&quot; Makoto laughed. &quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;m wearing 
the western-style dress now, and plan to tomorrow and the day after! 
Gotta make sure I get my money&#39;s worth, right!&quot;

The two women shared a laugh and then it was time for Souma to speak.

The groom looked a trifle uncomfortable and was even rubbing the back 
of his head worriedly when Himeko maneuvered Chikane towards him. They 
exchanged polite handshakes.

&quot;Thanks for coming,&quot; Souma said quietly, as though he wasn&#39;t sure what 
to make of the tall woman in front of him. 

&quot;Thank you, Oogami-san. Congratulations on your marriage. You&#39;re a very 
lucky gentleman,&quot; Chikane replied. Though she was smiling softly, her 
words were more polite than truly warm. 

Himeko felt a bit surprised at the distance in Chikane&#39;s tone, before 
she realized this was the first time her love had met her oldest 
friend. It saddened her a little that they didn&#39;t hit it off right 
away... 

Souma seemed to think about Chikane&#39;s words for a moment, before a 
smile finally cracked his face too. &quot;Yeah... yeah, I am. Thanks.&quot; He 
looked over at Himeko. &quot;Ne, Kurusugawa? If you want, you don&#39;t have to 
sit with the wedding party. Do you want to sit with Miyahime-san?&quot;

&quot;Of course she wants to sit with Chikane-san!&quot; Makoto laughed. &quot;Came 
for the food, but stayin&#39; for the lovin&#39;, aren&#39;t&#39;cha, Chikane-san?&quot; She 
giggled happily. Himeko wondered if someone had let the bride near the 
alcohol early. &quot;Close your mouth, Himeko, you&#39;ll catch flies! And I&#39;m 
serious; you don&#39;t have to sit with us! I&#39;m releasing you from your 
Maid of Honor duties for now, okay?&quot; She grabbed Himeko&#39;s cheeks and 
pulled them outwards. &quot;I&#39;m not letting go until you agree!&quot;

Himeko made some more noises of disbelief and reluctance (and even pain 
when Makoto pulled a bit too hard), before finally agreeing. She gave 
her childhood friends a warm, appreciative smile. &quot;Thank you, Mako-
chan! Souma-kun!&quot;

The bride gave her Maid of Honor a thumbs up, while the groom nodded 
and smiled kindly. 

As she led Chikane away, Himeko felt a warm fulfilment spread through 
her body. Despite this being their own special day, still Souma-kun and 
Mako-chan were supporting her. Himeko wrapped herself a little tighter 
around Chikane&#39;s arm, and could feel her beloved&#39;s pleased response. 

She hoped Mako-chan could forgive her for feeling like she was the  
luckiest one out of all of them today. 


***


Dinner was a fabulous western style six course gourmet meal. Chikane 
ate with as much dignity as she could, though in the end, she didn&#39;t 
eat all that much, blaming a grueling five hour car ride in the back 
seat of a sedan whilst Otoha-san broke speed limits several times 
over for her lack of appetite. They sat at one of the smaller tables 
for the guests. The other folks at the table were delighted to have 
the two of them join. 

Himeko described how the ceremony went, taking care to indulge in the 
details for Chikane&#39;s benefit. She explained how Kazuki-nii-san had 
been in a nervous fit, even though he had done the ceremony for many 
couples in Mahoraba before. Things were different though, when the man 
was to wed was his own brother, and the priest had almost driven 
Mako-chan mad with his fussiness that everything be absolutely perfect.

&#39;The term is &#39;Bridezilla&#39;, Kazuki-nii!&#39; Makoto had exasperatedly 
exclaimed. &#39;Not &#39;Brother-of-the-Groom-Slash-Shinto-Priest-zilla!&#39;&#39; 

As a side comment, Himeko joked to Chikane about how Mako-chan had 
almost given up halfway through and asked Souma if he just wanted to 
elope. Wisely, the man had said no.

The ceremony had been attended by the close friends (the ones Souma and 
Makoto had made bridesmaids and groomsmen, as Kazuki didn&#39;t have the 
heart to tell them those positions weren&#39;t really roles in a Shinto 
ceremony) and families of the bride and groom. Himeko described how 
surprised everyone had been when Souma&#39;s older blood brother, estranged 
for many years now, had shown up to wish his younger sibling luck and 
congratulations. His presence had made the ceremony seem that much more 
complete for Souma. Unfortunately, he had decided not to stay for the 
reception. 

Souma had been so handsome in his dark, formal kimono and hakama, and 
Makoto, when she&#39;d actually been following the ritual instead of making 
silly faces, had looked classically beautiful in pure, snowy white 
shiro-muku.

Despite his nervousness, Kazuki had performed a perfect ritual, 
bestowing great luck and favours on the newlyweds. Both Souma and 
Makoto recited their vows solemnly. They exchanged nuptial cups and 
wedding rings and offered twigs of sasaki to the gods.

After the solemn ceremony was over, and they had left the shrine, 
Makoto had promptly thrown her arms around her groom and planted a big 
wet kiss on him, much to the hooting and hollering of their gathered 
friends, and mild discomfort of their guardians.

They had changed out of their kimonos, washed off the, as Mako-chan put 
it, &quot;caked-on white crap&quot; makeup, thrown themselves into western style 
dresses, and headed over to Ototachibana Campus for the reception. 

While a school cafeteria was probably an odd place to hold the 
reception, Makoto and Souma had decided they had wanted to come back to 
the place where they had first met and fallen in love. And, when one 
considered that Ototachibana was arguably one of the finest and 
wealthiest schools in the country, with students studying at all levels 
from kindergarten to university (indeed, the village of Mahoraba seemed 
to have sprung into existence to service the needs of the school), and 
the fact that the cafeteria was built to rival ritzy hotel 
dining halls, perhaps it wasn&#39;t been so unbelievable after all... 

Presently, Chikane heard the band strike up, and noticed the chatter in 
the room grow louder. &quot;Have they begun the dancing, Himeko?&quot; 

&quot;Yes. Souma-kun and Mako-chan are sharing the first dance right now,&quot; 
Himeko reported, excited tones in her voice. &quot;Eeeh! I didn&#39;t know they 
could dance - oh!&quot; Chikane could hear the wince in Himeko&#39;s words and 
soft chuckles ripple across the guests. &quot;... I guess they can&#39;t. Mako-
chan just stepped on Souma-kun&#39;s toes. Ouch! And again! Oh, poor Souma-
kun!&quot;

The mirth in Himeko&#39;s voice made Chikane smile as she tapped her foot 
in time with the music. The song ended too quickly, Chikane thought, 
and then the next one began.

&quot;Don&#39;t you want to dance, Himeko?&quot; Chikane asked.

&quot;Hmm? Oh, no, not really,&quot; Himeko replied quickly, but with a hint of 
wistfulness in her voice that made Chikane think that the other woman 
wasn&#39;t being entirely truthful. &quot;I&#39;ve been on my feet all day, and 
although Mako-chan was really kind to her bridesmaids in terms of the 
dresses, she was not so kind with the footwear...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to hear that,&quot; a bubbly voice replied, &quot;because as Best Man, 
I&#39;m going to make the Maid of Honor dance with me anyway, Himeko.&quot;

&quot;Aaah, Yukihito-san! W-wait!&quot; 

There was a scraping of the chair against the floor and Chikane 
imagined that Himeko was resisting unsuccessfully against being pulled 
onto the dance floor. Tentatively reaching towards where Himeko had 
been sitting, Chikane found Himeko&#39;s back. She gave her lover a firm 
push up out of her chair.

&quot;Eeeh? Chikane-chan??&quot; 

She could almost _see_ the surprised expression on Himeko&#39;s face...

&quot;Go on,&quot; Chikane replied, smiling. &quot;I&#39;ll cut in later.&quot;

&quot;Thank you!&quot; Yukihito laughed. &quot;Now can we go, oh lovely Himeko?&quot;

Their voices drifted further and further away, and Chikane sat back in 
her chair, taking a deep breath.

For the first time since her accident, she was alone in an unfamiliar 
place. Tapping her foot with the music, Chikane was careful to bob her 
head lightly, so that those around her could see she was occupied, and 
would not feel unwanted sympathy and come to keep her company. Despite 
this, a good number of gentlemen still came up to her and tried to 
strike up a conversation. Everyone asked about the blindfold. Chikane 
replied as politely as she could, and then found ways to dismiss them 
with various degrees of coolness in her voice. 

Only one gentleman managed to put himself into Himeko&#39;s empty chair 
without Chikane cringing internally inside.

&quot;Miyahime-san.&quot; 

Chikane tilted her head in the direction of the voice, amused by the 
tell-tale slur; the groom hadn&#39;t recovered from having to toast at all 
the different tables. &quot;Aah, Oogami-san. Shouldn&#39;t you be out on the 
dance floor with your wife?&quot;

&quot;Aah, you can call me Souma. Makoto&#39;s dancing with her father right 
now.&quot;

&quot;Very well, Souma-san. Please, call me Chikane.&quot;

There was a slight increase in the smell of alcohol, and Chikane 
realized Souma must have leaned in towards her. She was relieved that 
he just hovered in front of her for a few moments, before he leaned 
back.

&quot;You know, for the longest time, I thought Kurusugawa was nuts. I&#39;d 
never known a girl who was so absolutely sure that her true love was 
out there, and so stubborn about waiting just for that person. I wished 
her the best of luck, but I never actually thought she would find 
you.&quot; 

Chikane sighed internally. Himeko had once told her about Souma&#39;s 
feelings for her whilst they had been in high school. Though the blonde 
woman had insisted those feelings had long since shifted to Makoto, 
somehow, Chikane had still been expecting this conversation...

&quot;You&#39;re not exactly who I expected, you know?&quot; Souma laughed. &quot;I spent 
the last two years of high school bettering myself tirelessly to try to 
get her attention, and that&#39;s how I got to know and fall in love with 
Makoto. Had I known... ah, well, had I known, then I suppose I 
wouldn&#39;t be married to Makoto now, eh? So I am thankful to you.&quot;

Chikane managed to not raise her eyebrows. This wasn&#39;t how she&#39;d been 
expecting the conversation to go... 

She heard Souma pull the chair back and the change in the direction 
from which his voice fell, told her he&#39;d stood up. &quot;Promise me you&#39;ll 
take care of Kurusugawa, eh? She&#39;s a very important person to both 
Makoto and to myself.&quot;

Chikane felt a small smile come to her face. A flicker of respect for 
the man lighted in her heart. &quot;I promise you, Oogami-san. As much as 
you will take care of Makoto-san, I will take care of Himeko.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot; 

The strength and solemnity in that one word surprised Chikane slightly; 
the man wasn&#39;t as drunk as she thought he was, if at all. She made the 
mental note not to underestimate Oogami Souma again.

&quot;Now... uh...&quot; and now, the groom&#39;s voice took on elements of awkward 
earnestness. &quot;Would you care to dance?&quot;

Chikane thought about it for a moment, before the smile on her face 
widened marginally. &quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot;

Souma lead Chikane carefully out onto the dance floor by his elbow as 
the band struck up a new song, and Chikane slid a hand gingerly down 
Souma&#39;s arm before finding his hand, putting her other one on his 
shoulder. Souma held her hand securely and put his other on her waist 
in a strong, but polite hold. They moved slowly and Chikane found that 
he led very well, ensuring that she didn&#39;t step on his feet (her heels 
would have punctured shoe and flesh).

As the song progressed, Chikane found herself moving further and 
further into the middle of the dance floor. She felt her respect for 
him grow, when, towards the end of the song, he bent down towards one 
of her ears and whispered softly that Himeko and Yukihito were to her 
immediately left and all she had to do was reach out and - no just a 
little higher, yes that&#39;s right - tap Yukihito on the shoulder to cut 
in.

&quot;Aaah, have you come to steal her from me?&quot; Yukihito asked good-
humouredly. 

&quot;If you don&#39;t mind,&quot; Chikane replied, feeling Souma&#39;s hands leave her 
waist.

&quot;Not at all, let&#39;s switch! I&#39;ve always wanted to dance with Souma-kun! 
Aaah, Souma, wait! Why are you walking away so quickly and 
purposefully, Souma? Sooooumaaaa!&quot;

Chikane hear Yukihito&#39;s voice fade away to the beat of two sets of feet 
leaving very rapidly, and then she heard Himeko&#39;s high giggle. Familiar 
hands slid tenderly over her shoulders to the back of her neck, playing 
with the short hairs at the base of her skull that had come loose from 
her bun. She felt Himeko step in close, their bodies touching, and drew 
her own hands over the sides of Himeko&#39;s flat stomach, intertwining her 
fingers contently together over the small of Himeko&#39;s back.

The silk of Himeko&#39;s dress (a beautiful bright red, Himeko had told 
her, with a boat neck and lose top and a bottom that fell to the floor 
in a very slinky and sexy way!) felt delightful against Chikane&#39;s skin. 
She lowered her head to whisper in the blonde woman&#39;s ear. 

&quot;Your dress feels really nice. I almost _don&#39;t_ want to slip it off of 
you.&quot;

&quot;Chikane-chan!&quot; Himeko hissed sweetly in mocked scandal. &quot;We&#39;re in 
public!&quot; But then she laughed, and Chikane felt her cheeks flare. &quot;Wait 
until tonight, okay? There&#39;s a place I want to show you...&quot;

The tall woman smiled as she felt her beloved put her head against the 
crook of her neck as they sashayed back and forth to the pretty love 
song. She put her cheek against the top of Himeko&#39;s head. &quot;Mmm... I can 
hardly wait.&quot;


***


Both bride and groom became so thoroughly drunk, they had to be carted 
out of the hall by midnight. Himeko and Chikane stayed to the very end 
with the rest of the wedding party, ensuring that the mess they left 
behind was manageable by the school cleaning staff, before they too 
finally took off.

Although it was well into the midsummer night, the air was warm and the 
breeze was light. Himeko walked barefooted, arm in arm with her love, 
across the familiar cobblestone paths that linked the various buildings 
of Ototachibana campus. Both she and Chikane had long since doffed 
their footwear; they held them in their hands, swinging them back and 
forth slightly as they walked.

Pangs of nostalgia kept washing over Himeko as they passed by, and she 
took care to describe the surroundings to the other woman, pointing out 
where she&#39;d spent so much of her adolescent years. That tree was 
planted in her senior year; over there were the dormitories, and in 
that direction were the high school classrooms... 

As they reached the fountain in the middle of the courtyard, Himeko 
directed Chikane off of the stone path and onto the grass. Himeko felt 
her heart speed up as her secret garden came into view.

&quot;I can smell roses,&quot; Chikane whispered softly.

Himeko smiled fondly. &quot;Yes, you should. A tree was planted when the 
school was first built, and over the years, it grew very large and 
strong. To keep the students from climbing all over it, they built a 
fence and planted rose bushes all around the tree, and those bushes 
eventually grew together into a hedge. In my first year, I discovered 
that there&#39;s a small gap in it where you can get through. It&#39;s really 
beautiful inside, and I spent a lot of lunch periods sitting under that 
tree. I don&#39;t think anyone else knows about it...&quot;

Barely able to contain her excitement, Himeko led Chikane up to the 
bushes, the taller woman smiling indulgingly.

&quot;Now, where was that - ah! Here it is. Okay, here,&quot; Himeko shifted 
Chikane&#39;s hold onto her waist. &quot;Now, you have to bend down a little - 
ah, yes, that&#39;s right, and we just have to... oh! I&#39;m sorry, Chikane-
chan. It&#39;s a bit tighter than I remembered it to be - we just sort of 
have to - aaah! I&#39;m sorry, Chikane-chan! Are you alright?&quot; 

Several roses fell victim to Himeko&#39;s desire to show her lover her 
secret sanctuary as they wiggled clumsily and a bit noisily through the 
bushes. Eventually, they made their way through, suffering only minor 
cuts and abrasions.

&quot;Yes, it&#39;s just a scratch.&quot; 

Chikane smoothed out her dress carefully, brushing away a bit of the 
debris that her hands came upon. There was a tiny red mark on one of 
her cheeks, just below her slightly eschewed blindfold. 

Himeko tenderly brushed her thumb over the mark, feeling sorrowful at 
its appearance, before she reached up and gently picked out the several 
leaves and small branches, and even one rose with a longish stem, that 
had gotten caught in Chikane&#39;s hair. She accidentally pulled out the 
hair sticks that pinned her lover&#39;s hair back, and sent the curtain of 
silky blue-black waves tumbling down like a quiet waterfall. A playful 
zephyr picked up several strands, and blew them about capriciously. 

Chikane smiled shyly, a self conscious blush rising to her cheeks as 
she tried to smooth back her hair. 

In the embrace of the cool moonlight, Chikane&#39;s blue-black hair and 
metallic grey dress shimmered and twinkled like a river of stars. Her 
creamy, pale skin was luminescent.

She was devastatingly beautiful.

Utterly dumb-struck, Himeko&#39;s heart started to flutter wildly, before 
it leapt up into her throat, smothering any words that might have lived 
there.

As Himeko watched, fascinated by the angel&#39;s every move, Chikane 
straightened up to her full height, and slowly turned her head this way 
and that, brow furrowed slightly, lips parted in wonderment. 

Wordlessly, she reached a hand out, fingertips brushing against the 
rose bushes, and took slow steps through the grass, walking halfway 
around the circle of the garden. She stopped on the other side, the 
tree obscuring her partially from Himeko&#39;s view. 

&quot;This... is your secret garden, Himeko?&quot; There was so much longing in 
her soft, low voice... 

The blonde woman felt her heart clench and then ooze downward heavily 
into her stomach as an obvious epiphany finally hit her. &quot;Yes... yes it 
is, Chikane-chan.&quot; Himeko bit her lip, suddenly feeling stupid and 
foolish. &quot;We&#39;ll come back again,&quot; she vowed, voice shaking with 
determination. &quot;We&#39;ll come back, when you&#39;re all better, and then... 
you can see for yourself...&quot; 

Chikane turned to face Himeko, and she took several steps towards her. 
Himeko took a worried step forward too, arm raised in warning, afraid 
that the other woman would walk right into the tree, but Chikane 
reached out as she approached it, touching the tree as though she had 
seen it.  

&quot;I... I&#39;ve... been here before,&quot; Chikane whispered in wonderment, 
fingers hesitantly tracing the rough bark of the aged oak, as though it 
would disappear under her touch. &quot;With you... together...&quot;

Himeko lifted her eyebrows. &quot;Chikane-chan...?&quot;

Chikane tilted her head back, looking sightlessly upwards. &quot;I... I feel 
like we&#39;ve... sat under this tree before... drinking tea... looking at 
photos...&quot;

Himeko took another step towards Chikane. As her lover spoke, ghosts of 
a dream started to dance through her mind&#39;s eye. 

... There was Chikane-chan, legs crossed in a seiza, wearing 
Ototachibana&#39;s burgundy uniform, with a yellow headband in her hair. 
She offered Himeko a cup, before bringing her own to her lips...

... There was Chikane-chan, smiling fondly as she looked up from a book 
of poetry in her lap. She inclined her head slightly as she granted 
permission, to snap a candid shot, much to Himeko&#39;s delight...

... There was Chikane-chan, waiting patiently as Himeko set the timer, 
and rushed back to her side. She gazed nostalgically at the camera, 
before Himeko spoiled the fond expression by impulsively draping 
herself 
all over Chikane&#39;s arm, causing her to blush with surprise. Chikane&#39;s 
eyes then softened kindly, as she pulled Himeko closer, and intertwined 
their fingers...

&quot;This garden.&quot;

Chikane&#39;s words broke through the heady spell, leaving Himeko feeling 
slightly disoriented.

&quot;This garden... did... did a small dog lead you here?&quot;

Himeko&#39;s eyes, softened in fond memory, now widened in surprise once 
more as she gazed at her lover. Not for the first time, she wished she 
could see Chikane&#39;s eyes, but the awe on the other woman&#39;s face was 
plainly evident even without the blue jewels that betrayed complex 
emotions and revealed thoughts. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; Himeko marvelled. &quot;A small, lost puppy. He led me to...&quot;

... There was Chikane-chan, eyes widened in surprise. She had looked so 
very unsettled at Himeko&#39;s sudden appearance, that the photographer 
felt the sudden need to sooth the other girl. Himeko plopped the 
adorable animal into the startled girl&#39;s arms as a peace offering, and 
watched, amazed by how beautiful the other girl became as one sloppy 
puppy kiss changed her expression from one of stern disapproval, to 
one of drool-ly delight...

&quot;He led me to you...&quot; Himeko whispered. She took another step forward, 
closing the gap between them. 

She felt a very warm happiness spread through her body as she tilted 
her head upwards and lightly kissed her lover.

She understood why she had always had the unshakable faith that she 
would met her one and only true love, her one and only Chikane-chan. 

Because Chikane-chan had always been with her. 

Chikane&#39;s lips were soft, and sweet. She kissed Himeko back lightly, 
and then more deeply, cupping Himeko&#39;s face in her palms. 

Himeko hummed with satisfaction, savouring the embrace before she 
stepped out of it, a mischievous smile on her face. Bringing up the 
rose that she had rescued from her lover&#39;s hair earlier, she touched 
the petals, just on the cusp of bloom, against a perfect nose, and then 
down across trembling lips. 

Chikane smiled in surprise, twisting her head about as she languidly 
chased after the rose that feathered up her jaw line, and against that 
sensitive place between her ear and neck that never failed to drive her 
mad with arousal. 

Himeko danced the flower down Chikane&#39;s throat, and down the valley of 
her bosom, even as the small blonde gently slipped the purring woman&#39;s 
dress from her shoulders. It crumpled obediently to the ground, leaving 
Chikane&#39;s flawless body deliciously unadorned and glowing in the 
moonlight. 

Between sweet kisses and soft rose petals, Himeko took the strength 
from Chikane&#39;s knees, sending her lover to the ground in delicious 
torment followed by shivering delight. 

Witnessed only by the indulging moonlight, and fuelled by the ghosts of 
either dreams or possibly memories, they made love, again and again, to 
the intoxicating scent of roses, roses, roses.


***


The first sounds of early birds and the dry warmth of the morning sun 
on her skin told Chikane that it was probably time to leave Himeko&#39;s 
secret garden - their secret garden. But the weight of the other 
woman&#39;s body against her side, the steady rhythm of Himeko breathing 
easily in her sleep, made Chikane feel loathed to rouse the woman; 
Himeko had only just drifted off after all, and Chikane herself felt 
more than just a little tired and sore as well. 

She was almost glad then, when the sound of fluttering wings and 
curious chirping grew nearer and nearer, and she felt Himeko shift of 
her own accord; victim to a curious young bird&#39;s landing and quick 
departure.

&quot;Himeko,&quot; Chikane whispered softly. &quot;We should probably go before 
people start looking for us.&quot; She paused. &quot;Or worse yet, actually find 
us...&quot;

Himeko gave a disappointed &#39;hmm&#39;, and Chikane felt her lover stretch 
reluctantly, inadvertently rubbing their bodies together in the 
process. Suddenly, both of them were roused, and in more ways than one. 
She heard Himeko giggle mischievously, and then, a moment later, felt 
the other woman nuzzling against that spot just under her chin again, 
sending shivers across her skin. 

Chikane tried very desperately - well, maybe not _that_ desperately - 
not to surrender herself to earthly urges, a task made double difficult 
as she felt Himeko roll over her, straddling her, and felt warm, moist 
lips trailing down her throat.

&quot;H-Himeko...&quot; Chikane pleaded, though she wasn&#39;t exactly sure what it 
was she was pleading for. &quot;We... we shouldn&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;We should.&quot;

Chikane tried to stifle a pleased sigh. &quot;No, we really shouldn&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;No, we really should.&quot;

Chikane gasped when Himeko found another sensitive spot. &quot;B-but the sun 
is up...&quot;

&quot;Mmm, doesn&#39;t it feel marvellous?&quot; 

Chikane couldn&#39;t disagree with Himeko&#39;s assessment. And she didn&#39;t 
particularly want to either. Heaving a happy sigh, she wrapped her arms 
around her lover, and kissed her back deeply, allowing her body to 
override the higher functions of her consciousness...

... until she heard a foreboding clink, followed by the unnerving 
hissing sound of an automatic sprinkler system firing up.


***


&quot;AHAH! AHAHAHA! AHAhaAHAHahahaHAHAhahahAHAA!!!!&quot; 

Makoto was laughing so hard, Himeko was scared the newly wed was going 
to split her sides. As it was, the brunette couldn&#39;t even stand up, and 
was weakly clutching at her husband to keep herself from falling to the 
ground. For his part, Souma hadn&#39;t actually laughed out loud, but he 
was having extreme difficulty keeping his face straight.

&quot;Mou, are you going to laugh until we leave, Mako-chan?!&quot; Himeko cried, 
standing in bare feet with her face as flaming red as the soaked dress 
that clung to her. Her face was the only place that felt warm; the rest 
of her was shivering under the large towel draped over her shoulders. 

After being rudely interrupted by copious amounts of cold, spraying 
water, Himeko and Chikane had decided that yes, just perhaps, they 
should take their leave of the garden. It had been supremely difficult 
to try and find every article of discarded clothing and untangle 
Himeko&#39;s dress from a sprinkler head. In their haste, they&#39;d completely 
forgotten about their shoes (as well as Himeko&#39;s bra, and Chikane&#39;s 
panties). 

&quot;V-very likely, Hi-Hi-hehehehehehe-meko!&quot; 

Himeko cringed and tried to will the stones on the ground to split 
apart and let her fall into a gaping maw in the earth. She felt Chikane 
give her hand a reassuring squeeze and snuck a glance over at the tall 
woman beside her. 

Even though Chikane was just as soaked and grass-stained as Himeko was, 
holding her fuzzy towel closed in front with one slightly trembling 
hand, somehow Chikane still managed to be perfectly dignified. There 
was a small, adorably sheepish smile on her face, and maybe just a hint 
of a blush on her cheeks, but beyond that, she seemed impervious to the 
mortification that wracked Himeko&#39;s own body. 

Really, the world just wasn&#39;t fair! How could anyone carry around that 
much poise without undergarments?! Himeko wished Otoha-san would hurry 
with the car already.

Just as Himeko thought this, a familiar vehicle pulled up the driveway 
to the main administrative building of the school they were waiting in 
front of, stopping just in front of the small group of friends. 

Otoha climbed out of the car, took one look at Chikane and Himeko, and 
her face contorted into one of disbelief and bewilderment. Himeko could 
almost hear the accusation in the maid&#39;s non-existent words: one night! 
I leave Ojou-sama in your care for _one_ night, and what happens?!

&quot;Aaah, I think your car has just arrived,&quot; Souma said, a thankful tone 
in his voice. &quot;Take care, Himeko. Thank you for everything.&quot; He turned 
to look at Chikane. &quot;And thanks for coming, Chikane-san. I hope you had 
fun.&quot;

Makoto started up a new round of snickering. &quot;Oh, I think they did 
alright...&quot; 

Himeko felt the very large desire to smack her best friend over the 
head, but managed to contain herself when Chikane chuckled. &quot;Indeed, it 
was a very pleasant evening. Congratulations again, Souma-san, Makoto-
san. Have fun on the honeymoon.&quot;

Inclining her head in farewell, Chikane gave Himeko&#39;s hand a squeeze 
before she released it, and allowed Otoha-san to lead her into the 
vehicle.

Himeko looked at her two oldest friends, both of them still grinning 
madly at her. Shaking her head as she sighed, she gave both of them 
tight hugs. &quot;Congratulations, guys. I&#39;m really happy for you two.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for being here, Himeko,&quot; Makoto managed to stop the giggles 
from wracking her body for just a moment. &quot;I really appreciated it. I&#39;m 
really happy for you too! Chikane-san&#39;s really swell.&quot; She nudged her 
husband in the ribs. &quot;Take notes, okay?&quot;

Souma snorted. &quot;Right. I&#39;ll even do one better and get the gardening 
staff&#39;s watering schedule beforehand.&quot;

Makoto started laughing again, and Himeko cringed a little more before 
hurrying into the car.

They were on the highway shortly, and Himeko leaned her head against 
her lover&#39;s shoulder, closing her eyes contently, sleepy again. She 
hadn&#39;t had much rest the previous night after all. She felt the other 
woman stroke her hair fondly. As she drifted in and out of awareness, 
she heard Chikane conversing lightly with Otoha-san.

&quot;Did you... have a good night, Ojou-sama?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Otoha-san. It was lovely. How was your evening?&quot;

&quot;Very well, Ojou-sama. I caught up with some old friends.&quot;

There was a long pause in the conversation, before Chikane spoke again.

&quot;Thank you, Otoha-san. I... I really needed to see Himeko.&quot;

Himeko felt fingers stroke the side of her face tenderly. She smiled 
happily. So Chikane-chan&#39;s arrival had been Otoha-san&#39;s doing. She 
really had to think of a way to properly thank the dutiful woman.

&quot;... You don&#39;t need to thank me, Ojou-sama. I... I just didn&#39;t want to 
see you suffering so. I only wish... I only wish I could have acted 
sooner...&quot;

As Himeko drifted off into sleep, she wondered why Otoha-san&#39;s voice 
sounded so regretful and guilty.

To Be Concluded


**********************************************************************


AUTHOR&#39;S NOTES &amp; OMAKE

So hopefully, Part II will appease those of you who were less than 
pleased with how Part I ended? &lt;cringes&gt; Please, no more shoes! No more 
shoes!

It wasn&#39;t until about halfway after I&#39;d written this chapter that it 
dawned on me that Himeko and Chikane should probably have worn 
traditional, formal kimono to Makoto and Souma-kun&#39;s wedding, since 
it&#39;s one of the few occasions left these days for a girl to wear a 
kimono. 

Unfortunately, the image of Chikane in That Dress wouldn&#39;t leave my 
head, so, western style fashion it was. =P This of course, meant that 
there couldn&#39;t be any obi-unwinding gags (where someone pulls the big 
wide belt really fast and makes the girl spin around like a top), which 
makes me sad. :(

... at this point in time, hopefully, you can probably figure out by 
now which scene is going to be *cough* detailed more explicitly in the 
extra 0.5 lemon chapter...

A big thank you to Naolin for all your beta-ing help and to Eimii for
advice! And another big thank you for those of you who enjoyed the 
story so far enough to comment! You really make the writing rewarding!

And, of course, the omake...

OMAKE I - Allergies

Chikane&#39;s lips were soft, and sweet. She kissed Himeko back lightly, 
and then more deeply, cupping Himeko&#39;s face in her palms. 

Himeko hummed with satisfaction, savouring the embrace before she 
stepped out of it, a mischievous smile on her face. Bringing up the 
rose that she had rescued from her lover&#39;s hair earlier, she touched 
the petals, just on the cusp of bloom, against Chikane&#39;s nose, and then 
down across her lips...

&quot;ACHOO!!!&quot;

Chikane sneezed loudly, sending snot flying all over Himeko&#39;s face. 

&quot;Eeeeeeew!!&quot;

&quot;Aaah, sorry, Himeko!!&quot;

OMAKE IV - Kannazuki no Miko Drama CD Track 5 Take 2! Many thanks, 
u101!

MIYAKO: Orochi... I mean, Ex-Orochi Confessional of Love... my lost 
sheep, please come in. 

&lt;Sound of heavy door shutting&gt;

MIYAKO: Now, confess your sins in front of God.

OTOHA: Forgive me, Sister, for I have sinned. The fruits of temptation 
were dangled so tantalizingly before me that I could not control 
myself...

MIYAKO: Aaah... &lt;recognizes OTOHA&#39;s voice. realizes what&#39;s going on, as 
she has read the first part of this fanfic&gt; Do you want to tell me more 
about the incident, my child?

OTOHA: ... it was an emotion that I&#39;d never felt before. It was so 
overwhelming, that I was swept away by the force of my desire, and 
could do nothing but satisfy my bodily urges, screaming in my blood.

MIYAKO: I understand, my child. But the Lord teaches us that we must 
show restraint. We cannot always give into our desires. That way leads 
only to the dark side. &lt;pause&gt; Wait, was that the Lord or Yoda? Ah, 
whatever. Never mind.

OTOHA: I understand, Sister. But I really could not help myself. It was 
just... it was just something that had to be done. Had to happen. And I 
don&#39;t think anyone was really hurt by it. Well, besides the victim. I 
made sure it _really_ hurt when I cut off her head with the wet end of 
a mop and threw her body into the river.

MIYAKO: &lt;blinks&gt; Victim?? Body?? Wait. &lt;opens the confessional window 
and stares at OTOHA&gt; Just what sin are you talking about, Keiko??

OTOHA: &lt;apron is absolutely _drenched_ in blood and gore&gt; Why, 
murdering the stupid author of this fic, of course! That cow finally 
gave me a sex scene with Ojou-sama, and then had me so riddled with 
guilt that I couldn&#39;t even enjoy it! I know the Lord tells us that we 
must have forgiveness, but, I had to have my vengeance! 

&lt;Loud thunder booms in interruption&gt;

OTOHA: &lt;looks up at the sky&gt; What the hell was that?

MIYAKO: Aaah, sorry. That&#39;s a leftover from the original Drama CD 
script. &lt;pauses&gt; You know, I could&#39;ve sworn that *we*, the necks of 
Orochi, were the only ones who were supposed to be doing any killing 
around here...

OTOHA: Aah, well, you snooze you lose, I guess... </pre>
