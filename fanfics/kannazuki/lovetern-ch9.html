text-indent:.5in'>Upon emerging from the Dimensional Portal, Saotome Makoto
found herself floating a hundred feet above the energy layer swirling around
the Temple of the Dragons, the complex that rode upon the sea of clouds and
winds. She <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>tskÅfed</span></i>
in slight irritation. Although the barrier provided the FollowersÅf lair with
what seemed to be impenetrable protection, it had but one inconvenient flaw.
The thing made direct dimensional warping to and from the Temple ground all but
impossible. Every time Makoto or any of the other Heads wished to go out, they
had to use the Elemental Blades to open a small hole in the barrier before they
could pass through. The more she had to do it, the more she found it
cumbersome. Sometimes she caught herself wishing that the Dark God would either
do something to make traveling a tad less tiring or just shut the damn things down
for good. She doubted anything could ascend to this insane height, catch up to
a structure that wandered the world, and launch an assault that could break
through its barrier anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Makoto shook her head. It was not the time for such trivial
things to cloud her minds, for she had more pressing matters to deal with.
According to what Susanou no Mikoto had told her in Tower of Kannazuki, the
real story behind this whole conflict between the Dark God and the humans was
much more complicated than she could have thought. For all she cared, Yamata no
Orochi could set fire to the entire world and cook it however his black heart
desired... but she certainly wasnÅft going to stand on the sideline if he was
going to burn Himeko along with it. The Dark God had assured Makoto that he
would keep the golden-haired girl safe, had sworn it with his Immortal name,
yet she had learned from the One Terminal in the Memories Hall that a promise
from the fabled eight-headed dragon might be as much <i><span style='font-family:
"Footlight MT Light"'>a lie</span></i> as everything else he had revealed about
himself. That was why Makoto had to learn his true plans before it was too
late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Makoto summoned Tasogare into her hand and channeled her
powers into the Sealed Sword. She stopped in midway, though, for something,
flickering at the edge of her vision, had captured her attention whole.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>From the sky above, a great sphere of blinding silver light,
seemingly appearing out of thin air, was shooting straight toward the Temple of
the Dragons with a speed so great that in a blink of an eye, it overcame a
distance that has to be at least a thousand feet and appeared several inches
away from the swirling protective barrier, burning the air in its approach.
Makoto felt her jaw dropping in shock. It was neither the incredible speed of
incoming projectile nor the frightening aura of power that it gave out that
concerned her, however. It was the image that her Orochi eyes had caught the
very moment it passed her by and made her feel as though she had just been
tossed into an open oven. Wreathed inside the silver light was Himemiya
Chikane, whose body was clad in the white chihaya and the red hibakama of the
Priestess of the <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Sun</span></i>,
whose hand was gripping the hilt of a slightly curved one-bladed sword. Most
shocking of all, the tip of the same sword was pointed at the DragonsÅf lair
itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>She meant
to attack the Temple!</span></i> Makoto thought in horror.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The humongous sphere of silver light collided with the
barrier in an explosion so deafening that MakotoÅfs ears almost bled from the
resultant sounds, which seemed to echo to the furthest corners of the earth.
Amidst the crashing shockwaves that kept yanking her cloak away from her neck
and shoulders, she could only stand and watch the mighty layer of protective
energy, what she thought to be impenetrable just a few minutes ago, come
crashing down like a fragile glass panel struck by a rock. Utterly and
completely ground into <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>fine</span></i>
<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>dusts</span></i> by only one
strike of a puny sword in the hand of a tiny girl. MakotoÅfs eyes tried to jump
out of their sockets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgWeak,Åh commented an apparently bored Priestess of the Moon,
around whose body the winds howled in mourning for the destruction of the
protective barrier, in whose hand shone a sword that showed no damage from the
great collision with what was built directly with the powers of the Dark God.
The corners of her mouth were curved in what seemed to be satisfaction. Her
sapphire eyes were shining with a light so cold she made ice seem hot. ÅgI am
most disappointed,Åh she continued as her head turned toward Makoto. A smile, mocking,
insolent, condescending, and most insufferable, crossed her lips. Makoto found
herself struck by a glance that probably would turn any other personÅfs blood
into ice. Her fists clenched in anger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>You have a
death wish, Himemiya,</span></i> she thought. Power bloomed in her and
multiplied rapidly until it soaked every fiber of her existence with its
exhilarating feel. Her hand rose. Her Sword, the tip of which was now directed
toward the Priestess of the Moon, pulsed with the heartbeat of the world, with
enough energy to level mountains and dry out the sea. <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Lowly creature of Heaven, you shall
not leave this place alive.</span></i> From the challenging gleam that she
could see in HimemiyaÅfs eyes, she believed the girl was aware that Makoto meant
to destroy her where she stood. The lack of any other kinds of response &#8211; the
infidel never tried to assume either a defensive or offensive stance &#8211; told
Makoto that she wasnÅft going to take her seriously. Her grip tightened around
the hilt of Tasogare. The Priestess wouldnÅft think so any more once Makoto had
stripped off her hide and feed it to the sharks. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Before she could launch an attack, though, five sources of
power, all of which bore the stench of the Dark God, entered her mind. Without
taking her eyes away from the Priestess, she could still feel the approaching
presences of the rest of the Orochi Heads. To her distaste, Himemiya Chikane
never showed the merest hint of fear even after she found herself surrounded
from all sides by the Followers, in whose hands the Swords gleamed dangerously,
on whose faces varying expressions could be glimpsed. Girochi Tokiya, master of
the Water Blade, was eyeing the mortal enemy of his liege lord with a mix of
fear and confusion. His sister, Girochi Miyako, was glaring at the blue-haired
girl with burning hatred in her eyes. Hibiki Shizuku, the cat-fanatic who
insisted everyone else to call her Nekoko, was studying the Himemiya heiress
with open interest. Oota Reiko the icy killing machine, surprisingly, appeared
to be struggling with herself instead of placing her full attention on the
Priestess of the Moon. The bespectacled woman was gazing straight ahead so
insidiously that anyone could have figured out that she was trying to avoid
looking at the girl who stood to her left. Korona, face glum and eyes heavy
with depression, was staring at the mangaka openly and didnÅft seem to care if
Himemiya flayed her to death. Makoto did not doubt for one second that the
mangaka was the supplier of the pop idolÅfs sour mood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgSo, you still live,Åh Himemiya remarked after a glance at the
Girochi siblings. ÅgPests do not die easily, do they?Åh She chuckled quietly at
that. The girl had to have suicidal courage, Makoto thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅgHimemiya
Chikane!Åh</span></i> Miyako growled. She would have flung herself at her enemy
and let common sense be hanged had it not been for her kid brother, who put a
hand on her shoulder and held her back. When she saw that Tokiya was shaking
his head almost exasperatedly, she felt silent and assumed her defensive
stance. She still looked like a volcano about to erupt, though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Nekoko laughed and clapped her hands in such a delighted
manner that Makoto could have sworn that the woman had just finished watching
her favorite TV show. ÅgYour tongue is as wicked as ever. You have not changed,
I see, Moon Priestess,Åh said the alleged doctor of Tate University, where
Makoto had spent a few days in physical rehabilitation, where she had met the
cat-fanatic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgNor have you,Åh replied the blue-haired girl, smiling almost
sweetly. Her eyes were still ice-cold, though. Oota Reiko was famous among the
Orochi for her soul-freezing stare... yet compared to Himemiya Chikane, the
Orochi Fifth Head looked kind and friendly. Makoto was surprised. Despite
knowing that the rich girl was by no means someone who acted chummy with people
with the sole exception of Kurusugawa Himeko, she had never seen the Priestess
of the Moon behaving in such a scary way. ÅgYou are still the Orochi I recall,
only more treacherous and less likable. Why, you do not show the slightest bit
of anger knowing your brethren almost died under my hand. I would not put it
past you to sell out the other Followers to achieve your own goals.Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The irritating and calculating smile that Nekoko always wore
was immediately wiped off her lips. ÅgWatch your mouth!Åh she growled in a voice
that reeked of burning fury. Another surprise. As far back as Makoto could
remember, the cat-fanatic never allowed herself to lose her calm in front of
others, and she never got rid of her creepy smile. Furthermore, the Sixth Head
was a woman who was impervious to taunts and criticism. There should be no way
in hell Himemiya Chikane could tick her off. Her breath caught at the thought
and her eyes narrowed at the wielder of Arashigumo the Wind Blade.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The Priestess of the Moon chuckled, certainly amused. ÅgWhy
should I? If you are indeed loyal to your liege lord, you need not fear my
questioning. Unless....Åh Although she said no more after that, Makoto was
certain that none Orochi Head present here would fail to understand what she
had more than just implied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅgI shall
not stand here to be insulted by the likes of you, Priestess!Åh</span></i>
roared the cat-fanatic, who did not notice that her brethren were studying her
openly with suspicion written across their faces. All she cared about at the
moment was obviously the utter destruction who had just questioned her loyalty
to the Dark God, which was of course a very dangerous thing to do. Eyes ablaze
with unspeakable fury, face so red one would expect her mouth to breathe out
fire, she held up her Arashigumo. The winds howled fiercely at their masterÅfs
seldom shown temper and coiled around the shiny blade of the Sealed Sword. The
air began to solidify. The cloud, upon which the Temple of the Dragons traveled
the world, started to roil as though water boiling atop a stove.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>To the surprise of everybody save the Priestess, the one who
struck first was not Nekoko, but Girochi Miyako, the Vice Commander of the Dark
GodÅfs personal army. The darkly tanned woman, whose hand held her Rekkyou the
Fire Blade high over her head, bellowed while her whole body was bursting with
the power bestowed by her liege lord, ÅgOrochi, attack!Åh The ocean of clouds,
already boiling under the power of Arashigumo the Wind Blade, were punctured by
enormous flows of golden flames that slithered in the sky like living snakes.
Those serpentine currents wasted no time in rushing directly at the Priestess
of the Moon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Hibiki Shizuku, after a moment of stunned silent, also
released the energy she had channeled into her Sealed Sword as she swung it in
front of her in a wide arc. A colossal wave, which was tall as any building in
Downtown Mahoroba and made entirely from winds and fogs, emerged and hurled its
ethereal self at the blue-haired girl. From the way it was woven, Makoto
suspected that any person who was enveloped by this tidal wave would have their
body ripped into unrecognizable pieces. It was a very dangerous spell, she
thought. Coupled with what was unleashed by MiyakoÅfs Fire Blade, it only became
much more so now that the two of them together had blocked out Himemiya
ChikaneÅfs every escape route.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Frowning slightly, Makoto moved out of the way so that she
wouldnÅft be caught in the Third HeadÅfs thirst for vengeance and the SixthÅfs
desire to silence someone who appeared to have touched a nerve. The other
Followers were doing the same thing, she realized. Girochi Tokiya, who had
positioned himself safely out of harmÅfs way, seemed to want to support his
elder sister but too occupied with his own thoughts and calculations to
actually lift a hand. Amusingly enough, Oota Reiko, who had placed herself
firmly in front of the pop idol the very moment Nekoko launched her attack, now
had such an expression of horror and disbelief on her face that Makoto would
wager her own Sword that the woman had not consciously meant to do that.
Meanwhile, the Fourth Head couldnÅft have looked happier with a brilliant smile
on her lips. That smile died away as soon as she put a hand on the other
womanÅfs arm, most likely to show her appreciation and affection, and was harshly
bushed off. She was stunned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Paying the weird couple one of which couldnÅft come to terms
with her own feelings, Makoto returned her full attention to the Priestess of
the Moon, who looked unruffled even though the two OrochiÅfs spells were
converging on her and about to turn her into burnt minced meat. Neither the
heat of the currents of fire nor the pressure of the advancing wall of winds
fazed her in the least bit. And then, when they were practically on top of her,
she raised her one-bladed sword skyward and closed her eyes. It was only then
that Makoto noticed the existence of the shining Moon Crest that was engraved
upon the portion of the blade near the hand guard. Her eyes went wide. There
was but one weapon in the Three World which bored that symbol, she had been
told by the Dark God. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>The Eye
of Luna!</span></i> she thought. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Kagetsuki!</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Silver light erupted from the Crest and drowned everything in
sight with its cool luminescence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Despite knowing that the PriestessesÅf holy light couldnÅft
hurt her, Makoto still erected her Tasogare and wove a protective barrier
around her body. She didnÅft like surprises... and based on what she had seen
today, Himemiya Chikane surely was capable of delivering the nastiest ones.
Besides, caution could never hurt, especially after she had noticed that the
rich girl had managed to conceal her powers so well that Makoto couldnÅft even
measure them. She had learned that dogs who hid their fangs and kept quiet were
the most dangerous of all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The Twilight Blade suddenly trembled in her hand exactly the
second she sensed an alien presence of power surging inside her sword and
trying to invade every corner of the weapon. Lips thinning in irritation, she
launched a counteroffensive and spread out her own powers so that they cast a
net around the unknown force. To her disappointment, it had withdrawn very
quickly before it could be caught and destroyed. To her surprise, a faint
tremor in the very fabric of space, a disturbance in the dimensional structure
that she governed, marked the instance in which no alien presence remained in
her Elemental Blade. To her shock, a wail full of agony immediately followed. <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>It was NekokoÅfs voice!</span></i> she
thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>When the silver light subsided, Makoto found a virtually
untouched and unhurt Himemiya Chikane, whose hand was still holding her sword,
whose eyes were following the fall of the cat-fanaticÅfs bloodied body with a
cruel smile on her lips. That smile grew wider when the self-styled doctorÅfs
back landed upon the grassy ground of the TempleÅfs back garden, which more than
softened the impact. There, the woman lay with her eyes closed, with blood
gushing out from numerous wounds on her face, her limbs, and her waist. None of
those seemed fatal, yet were she left to her own device, she would die very
soon of severe blood loss. Unsurprisingly, no other Orochi, including Makoto
herself, appeared at the very least interested in the well-being of the
cat-fanatic. Their eyes were on the Priestess of the Moon, their mouth hanging
in speechlessness. Girochi Miyako, especially, seemed shocked to the core. The
ocean of clouds had grown peaceful again, the air so still none would believe
that just moments ago, it had been a raging battlefield between two Orochi and
a Priestess.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;Unlike her brethren, Makoto was not surprised by the
outcome of the battle, for she knew that Himemiya Chikane was more than capable
of warding off the assaults. What surprised her, however, was the fact that the
blue-haired girl had done that by invoking dimensional power, which Makoto was
certain that only she could control. Unless the Dark God had lied to her,
Tasogare was the only thing in this world that allowed a mortal to manipulate
the fabrics of space.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgIs there any other who wishes to try their strength against
mine?Åh asked the Priestess, whose sapphire eyes were calmly scanning the faces
of the remaining Orochi. ÅgDeath is a wish I can always grant.Åh Although the
other Followers stiffened visibly at that, none moved a muscle. Makoto
suspected that her brethren, having witnessed what had become of the foolish
Nekoko, no longer had any wish to fight. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>The
first to act would also be the first to die,</span></i> they had to be thinking
in their heads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Not that such a thing applied to Makoto, though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgVery droll, Himemiya,Åh she said dryly. ÅgNow weÅfll see if you
have enough skill to back your words.Åh Powers, born from the depth of her soul,
raced to her hand and entered Tasogare through the hilt. The black blade of the
Sword then pulsed and released fine filaments of the same color, which then
coiled around its edges. The shadow that she cast on the ocean of clouds
beneath her feet, originally just a small disc, expanded at a neck-breaking
rate. In but a few seconds, it managed to stretch all the way to the distant
horizon, leaving no spot untouched. A signal from Makoto would mean the rise of
countless lances made from the darkness. A flicker of her hand would command
those lances to skewer the Priestess, who had nowhere to hide. Although it was
indeed true that the Dark God had issued an order that the girl was not to be
harmed, Makoto was willing to ignore it. After all, she had no reason to let
Himemiya Chikane live!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The rich girl said nothing in response. She merely gave
Makoto a chilly look before she raised her left hand and deployed her own
powers. Silver light erupted beneath her tabi-sandaled feet and pushed back the
shadow that Makoto had wrought upon the ocean of clouds. Now, the vast field
was divided into two, one silver, one black. She gave a vexed tsk and began
racking her mind for a way to break the stalemate. Before she could come up
with one, however, she heard the Third Head Girochi Tokiya shouting desperately
in the background, <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅgDonÅft,

over the Priestess of the Moon from behind. Face painted with triumph, the
woman brought down Rekkyou with both hands in an evident attempt to dismember
the person who nearly sent her to the Underworld yesterday. As if she had eyes
on her back, Himemiya Chikane spun around while her right hand slashed upward
along with the Eye of Heaven in a silver blaze. Orochi-forged steel met
Gods-forged one in a dance of sparks. Dual-bladed Sealed Sword clashed again
one-bladed katana in a deafening sound. And the former suffered a miserable
defeat in the end. Rekkyou the Fire Blade left the hands of Girochi Miyako,
spun upward high into the twilight sky, and vanished.</p>

her lips. Her words were colder than ice. ÅgFor their lives are but vain and
short... the very same way yours is.Åh A portion of the silver light, which had
been gathering around the Moon Crest on the eye of Heaven, shifted up her right
arm, crossed her shoulder, traveled along her left, and ended up swirling
around her hand. The Orochi Second Head, probably already aware of what was
going to happen to herself, began to look at Himemiya Chikane pleadingly.
Makoto shook her head. Courage had never been a virtue that the darkly tanned
woman possessed.</p>

Vines of shadows thick as an adult rose from the darkness patch on the ocean of
clouds and whipped at the blue-haired girl at the speed of a bullet. It wasnÅft
that she cared whether the wielder of Rekkyou died or lived. She attacked only
because she refused to let the Priestess of the Moon do as she wished. Besides,
if Girochi Miyako lost her life, Makoto would be one of the people who would
have to face the wrath of the Dark God afterwards. Until she had learned of his
true intentions, she did not plan to lose his favor anytime soon.</p>

and rushed upward, threatening to swallow the blue-haired girl alone. The
Priestess proved yet again that she had inhuman reflexes, for she wasted no
time, and apparently no thoughts, in tossing the darkly tanned woman caught in
her clutches away and grounding the tip of Kagetsuki against the pillar. At the
same time, silver light enveloped her slender frame, incinerated the shadow
vines, and hurled the Third Head backward. Like a current of water meeting an
obstacle in its path, the light forked and streamed to the sides of the silver
sphere that were enveloping the body of its target. Eventually, the attack
ceased, leaving an airborne Priestess who was neither disturbed nor fazed. The
girl, who must have nerves of steel, simply put her full attention of the seven
whirlpools of light that were arranged into the shape of the Hokuto Shichisei
upon the smooth bed of clouds stretching wherever the eye could see. The other
Orochi including Girochi Miyako, who was now shivering madly in the protective
embrace of her little brother, might as well never have existed. </p>

his crooked Hokuto the Star Blade in his right hand, was standing on the grassy
ground of the back garden, near an unconscious Nekoko who in his eyes could
have been a log, while looking intently at the Priestess of the Moon. It was
the first time that Makoto saw signs of fear on the manÅfs face. He was probably
thinking the same thing as her. If Himemiya Chikane could deflect three
offensive prongs at the same time and still was able to emerge unharmed

to stay instead of going back to the control room. She disliked it there. Being
a hygiene maniac, which she became after three thousand years of wearing

she was going to stay in a room filled with people who didnÅft have a clue about

three baths a day, and she might just do four if her schedule informed her that
she was going to spend time by the side of the person she loved, for whom she
bought strawberry cheesecakes on a daily basis. Besides, she was about to
supervise a large-scale experiment that spanned the entire Heart of the

forests that surrounded Reiha, uprooted trees, and destroyed whatever else that

years ago, when the Regent of the Underworld and her daughter Yue the Goddess

began when the then sixteen-year-old found a book in the Grand Library that
spoke of how snow, made entirely out of water, fell in certain parts of the

veins with blood, and close the wounds on his skin. Unlike the last time they
laid their hands on him, this time they succeeded. Despite the fact that the
Orochi power within him still repelled the ProtectorÅfs healing, they managed to
suppress it and delay the toll of judgment. His brother the High Priest told
him upon waking that he should be thankful that the holy light of Kagetsuki had
taken out so much of his Orochi power that they were no longer strong enough to
stop the Protectors from healing him.</p>

immediately, however, as soon as his eyes fell on a little object sitting in
one of the dark corners. It was a present box gift-wrapped in silver foil. Its
top was attached with an elegantly tied ribbon and a small note card upon which
Kurusugawa HimekoÅfs neat and cursive handwriting could be seen. It read, <i><span

found this little present floating on the surface of the swimming pool in Tate
University Hospital, where he also found the girl and Himemiya Chikane taking
shelter from the rain. He had picked it up, read the note attached to it, and
intended to return it to its rightful owner. Only... that his curiosity had
gotten the best of him at that time and compelled him to use his powers to
learn just exactly what lay inside. He did, and found out to his horror that it
was a sapphire ring. Others might think it nothing out of the ordinary, they
might dismiss it and see it as just a simple present a girl might give her
friend on her birthday, but Souma knew better than that. He could still recall
what she had told him years ago, when both of them were still kids and living
in Tokyo, that she would present a ring to no one except the person she had
chosen to be her romantic interest. It only hurt him more at that time, when he
thought back and realized that she never intended to give him one. </p>

to avert their eyes and leap down the mouth of some fuming volcano to warm
themselves up. Very few were aware that deep down, Yue hid a temper that was

very similar to the daughter of their liege lady when it came to beautiful
faces that inspired apprehension more than admiration and frosty attitudes. The
main difference between them was that the sisters skilled were manipulators at
heart, which in turn made them far more dangerous than the Goddess of the Moon.
Haruhi, a formidable strategist and a true heartbreaker, was such a good
actress that no one except for her twin sister had ever been able to figure out
what she was thinking at any given time. Fuyura, the renowned precision machine
of the Underworld, was a straightforward girl who always spoke her mind without
a single care whom she might offend. No less than twice she had called Yui a
fool to her face just because she resisted their attempts to bring her to the
Underworld. She turned to a real sweetheart, however, whenever romantic
interest was around. The raven-haired girl was even willing to try making
strawberry cheesecakes with her own hands so that she could give them to the
person she loved. Yui still couldnÅft figure out why that person still hadnÅft

food so much he never had leftover, the truth was that he only ate what they
prepared for him once, on the very first day that he moved into the Shrine. He
never failed to experience a shivering chill whenever he recalled his first
time gulping them down afterwards. Had the chef been in YukihitoÅfs service, he
would have fired him and made sure the man would never find a job again in the
culinary world. He still had not figured out why the Priests, including Oogami
Kazuki himself, always praised the food up and down as though they were

piles that they would burn later. On high, the sun was retreating toward a
blood-red horizon. A couple of hours from now, three at most, stars would light
up the heavens in the welcoming of the serene October night. And then majestic
moon would come and dominate all with its silver luminescence. YukihitoÅfs feet
instinctively pressed harder into the ground littered by yellow leaves that had
lost all signs of life. Muttering darkly to himself, he continued walking
straight toward the kitchen and ignored the Priests who called out to him in a
friendly manner. He was in no mood to talk to them today, seeing how everything
had not been going the way he wanted for the last week or so.</p>

ground and hurried toward the direction of the shout. There he found several
Shingetsu Priests gathering around an infuriated Oogami Kazuki, who apparently
was involved in a fight with his adopted brother, the traitorous Seventh Head.
Near where the Oogami siblings stood, both of them red-faced and making furious
gestures with their hands, was the Priestess of the Sun. The golden-haired girl
was sitting with her back leaning against one of the supporting beams, body
clad in a casual yukata, amethyst eyes imprinted with grief words alone could
not convey. Her face was drenched with tears. Her mouth, slightly opened,
revealed a pair of lip swollen with teeth marks and stained with blood dried to
a dark crimson color. The girl never went easy on herself while crying, it

nothing while being eternally chained to the darkness. For three thousand years

firmed with determination. They began to stare at each other like two wet cats
caught in the same place. Yukihito quietly shook his head. Grown men...
fighting like children.... It was the first time he saw such a thing. ÅgPush her

shock. As his bottom landed on the wooden floor, something fell out from his
pocket and rolled all the way to the side of the Priestess of the Sun. It was a
little pretty present box gift-wrapped in silver foil. Unaware that he had
dropped something, the younger Oogami sprang up to his feet fiercely and
resumed his shouting match with the other. All other spectators were so
engrossed in looking, some even seemed amused, or trying to take the two apart
that they never realized that Kurusugawa Himeko had reached out her hand and
picked up the present box. Only Yukihito had his eyes on the golden-haired
girl, who stared at what now stood atop her palm before she held it closer to
her heart and began to weep in silence. Tears spilled out from the overflowing
wells of her eyes.</p>

Deep within her soul, powers were born and raised until they filled to bursting
every fiber of her existence. Golden aura flooded out from the PriestessÅfs body
then, suffusing the space around her with the heat of the burning star. Winds
fled from the heart of the light, howling and screaming. Torrential currents of
celestial energies raced unrestrained and unchecked as they beat up against YukihitoÅfs
own body with the intensity of the ocean waves beneath the storm-plagued
heavens. At this very moment, the golden-haired girlÅfs potential had very much
amounted to that of a middle-ranked Goddess. Surprised, he instinctively took a
step backward. He did not recall ever permitting the R&amp;D Division of Izumo
to give either of the Kannazuki Priestesses so much power. <i><span

forced to use his arms to shield his eyes as he retreated from the sitting
place of Kurusugawa Himeko along with the other Priests. Since they had no way
of seeing where they were going &#8211; the&nbsp; light was so blindingly bright that
Yukihito doubted they could see anything were they brave enough to open their
eyes &#8211; some tripped and fell flat on their stomach. Not that the injuries they
accrued from their continuous falls could compare to the damage that was being
inflicted upon the body of the young master of the Grand Shrine who, as an
Orochi at the very core of his existence, was finding the holy light of a
Priestess little less harmful than a knife to a mortalÅfs heart. On the wooden
floor a stoneÅfs throw away from the girl of his dream Oogami Souma, who was now
down on his knees and shaking uncontrollably while smoke rise from his fully
clothed body. His pupils were vibrating at the speed of light, his mouth
hanging wide open, yet the boy could not utter a single word. Before, the light
had never hurt him because Kurusugawa Himeko never wanted it to. It was a
different story now, when agony had overwhelmed her heart and rendered her
incapable of distinguishing between friends and foes.</p>

would be laid to waste under the fierce assaults of Kurusugawa HimekoÅfs
unrestricted strength. He scanned the vicinity. Shingetsu had been immersed in
this aura maelstrom, all the people within it trying their best to keep their
eyes from going blind. None would see. And of course, with the Priestess of the
SunÅfs powers running rampant so, the spies from the Underworld would never
notice if he cast some little spell.</p>

scorching flame it had wrought. Immediately afterwards, Kurusugawa Himeko fell
into YukihitoÅfs arms and passed out. Looking at her, he again sensed his heart
ache. Sometimes he found himself wishing that living in the same place as the
Shingetsu High Priest had never taught him the meaning of guilt.</p>

racked with worries. The boy, despite sustaining more damage than the others,
was now able to move around. Not that his insides were not giving him hell,
Yukihito suspected. Had there not been a slew of spectators watching his every
moment and listening to everything he said, the Seventh Head of the Orochi
would have been thrashing in pain on the ground right at this moment. The boy
had great control on his body, Yukihito had to give him that.</p>

room, where he laid her gently on her back before pulling the blanket over her
shoulders. Even in her sleep, the Priestess of the Sun looked like she was crying
still. YukihitoÅfs heart gave another slight jolt. Trying to convince himself
that it was not his fault that she ended up in this miserable state and that he
only did what he had to do, he whispered something that was too soft to be
heard. ÅgPlease forgive me, child.Åh He suspected that when the girl knew what he
had done, she never would.</p>

questions that needed to be answered. Thinking that he needed some to his own
inquiries, Yukihito followed them.</p>

Tsubasa, his dark eyes boring like drills at the back of the Priestess. They
were the only two Heads present at the moment. The cat-fanatic Hibiki Shizuku
was being tended to in her quarters by both the Fourth and the Fifth Heads, the
latter not exactly happy about being in the same place as the former. Girochi

honey, teetering forward on the path to destruction.Åh From the way the

swept to that of the First Head. ÅgAs you are all aware, Ame no Murakumo had
lain imprisoned beneath the surface of the Moon years before our Dark God
descended on the Human World. Neither did he move nor do anything else to prove
that he was anything more than a breathing corpse. The Sword God, mighty as he
was, could not be trusted with the mission to rid the world of the Orochi.
Despite that, Izanagi and his cunning aides, the Celestial Assembly, succeeded
in devising a plan that would help them overcome the obstacle. They figured out
that it was possible to turn Ame no Murakumo into a puppet that could easily be
controlled. Such was the idea that led to the creation of Project Kannazuki and
the birth of the Priestesses.</p>

brought to life in the crystal artificial wombs of HeavenÅfs R&amp;D Division,
whose potentials were enhanced even more to cope with the destiny chosen for
them before birth. One of the two was I, the other, my childhood friend and
former comrade, Akari the Priestess of the Sun.Åh A shadow of sadness stole
across the Moon PriestessÅfs face. ÅgBearing the codename Kannazuki as our family
name despite being unrelated by blood, we were delivered into the custody of
Tsukiyomi the Goddess of the Moon, who raised us and loved us as her own
daughters. Under the roof of the Lunar Shrine, we were taught the way of the
swords and learned to control our powers. There, we waited until it was time
for us to fulfill our role.Åh Toward the end, her complexion darkened in what
seemed to be anger and her voice grew much colder and more murderous. Makoto
understood perfectly why. After all, Susanou had informed her all about that
inhuman Project.</p>

against the usual raids of the Orochi minions, shrines were erected to honor
our names and to give the spark of faith a place to live. Leading those
shrines, of course, was the great Shingetsu Grand Shrine. Little did they, or
we the Priestesses, know what we were supposed to do to rid Onogoro of you.Åh</p>

return to Izumo,Åh the blue-haired girl smoothly picked up where she left off as
though nothing had happened. ÅgThere, the Celestial Assembly made their
objectives known. There, the Goddess of the Moon broke into tears as she heard
how one of her daughters was going to <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>die</span></i>
by the otherÅfs sword as a sacrifice. Yes, the so-called Summoners of Ame no
Murakumo were in fact tools for the Immortals to achieve their purpose. We were
pawns that they felt no remorse to kill when they needed to.Åh</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgThe Sword GodÅfs Seal requires it,Åh Himemiya answered without
looking at the First Head. Her eyes, once again, were on the empty corner.
Makoto began to find the smile on the girlÅfs face very irritating. ÅgOnly the
pure blood of a Priestess could temporarily dissolve the spells that kept Ame
no Murakumo bound. Only the life force of a Maiden with untainted Innocence
could invoke the second function of the Twin Swords of the Sacred Light.Åh</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgOf course not,Åh Makoto muttered in response. The answer was
what Makoto had expected. She believed she had an idea of what the girl was

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgBecause someone has to stay behind to act as Ame no
MurakumoÅfs puppet master,Åh the Priestess replied smoothly. She seemed ready for
any question thrown at her, for that matter. Makoto guessed that the girl had
prepared herself very carefully before she came to the Orochi lair. ÅgOnce the
Sword God was out of his cage, the surviving Priestess would use her powers to
seize his mind through her own Eye of Heaven and have him defeat her enemy.Åh</p>

smile. Makoto and Tsubasa didnÅft share their amusement, though. She did not
know about the First Head, who studied Himemiya Chikane with unconcealed
suspicions, but she herself was still unsure as to whether she should expose
the truth about the Himemiya heiress. After a while of struggling with her own
mind, she decided to keep her mouth shut and watch as the events unfold all on
their own. One wrong step could destroy everything she held dear, and that she
did not want to happen.</p>

she was about to toss herself at the Priestess of the Moon and dismember the

unspeakable anger, Makoto only snarled wordlessly at her while seriously
considering making the First Head yield should the man continue to block her

Makoto fired back at the other girl. ÅgOne more untrue word about her and IÅfll

increase. Makoto thought that he meant to stop her regardless of the fact that
she was the stronger between them. She suddenly darted her eyes at the Crystal
Orb and wondered whether the Dark God was capable of forcibly reclaiming
Tasogare. The very thought stayed her hand.</p>

knew it, Tsubasa had summoned his Hokuto the Star Blade and put its edge next
to the rich girlÅfs throat. Any other person would have jumped away in order to
prevent themselves from being cornered. Any other person would have reacted and
drawn her weapon to protect her own life. Not Himemiya Chikane, who simply
stood there and gazing ahead as though the fearsome Hokuto did not exist. Her
eerie calmness placed Makoto under the impression that should the blue-haired
girl choose to, she could put herself out of harmÅfs way and destroy the First
Head where he stood. Tsubasa obviously shared the same thought, for his face
hardened in anger and his hand put the Star Blade an inch closer to the
PriestessÅfs skin. He seemed a bow string on the verge of release. Should his
hostage twitch a muscle, he would behead her regardless what order his liege

High PriestÅfs study, they did not walk in the same direction. While the Orochi
Seventh Head walked toward the kitchen &#8211; obviously looking for food &#8211; and
muttered about a certain Priestess that he thought coward and selfish, Yukihito
headed back to his own room and thought to himself that the boy still had a
very long way to go before he achieved the maturity and the cleverness of his
adoptive brother. Not that he blamed the traitor of a Follower for thinking
about Kannazuki Aoi in such a negative way, though. Anybody who heard the tale
told from the High PriestÅfs mouth would be led toward the same conclusion.
Yukihito glanced over his shoulder at Oogami Kazuki, who was sitting at the
wooden ledge in front of his room and staring bleakly at the twilight sky, and
thought, <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>I see what you are

time to hear the phone on the table ring exactly three times, become silent for
a minute, and then go off three more times before it truly shut up. It was no
call from anywhere in the Human World, he realized, for such a ringing pattern
was a secret code that none save him and his trusted aide knew. He wondered
what the other man wanted to speak with him so urgently for. If it was not the
emergency that the secret code claimed it to be, Yukihito was going to make his
aide wish that he had never punched those damn dials. After all, with the Underworld
spies sitting practically on top of him, he could not afford traveling between
the two Worlds any more than absolutely necessary.</p>

less than a heartbeat, he found himself standing inside a dimensional pathway
connecting Shingetsu Grand Shrine and the Heavenly Palace. Upon the path that
was made of light Yukihito treaded, sensing everything about him change. First,
his short hair deepened its color from brown to black and at the same time it
grew rapidly in length. They stopped when they reached his waist, where a thin
white ribbon tied them all the way to the nape of his neck, forming a long but
tidy tail. His nose raised a little bit higher, his face thinner and brighter.
The rough and worn texture of his blue denim jeans softened into the fabrics of
the finest white silk. His simple T-shirt liquefied into light and became a
wide-sleeved cloak streaked with silver and gold, which bore the Crests of the
Sun and Moon on each side of its stiff collar. A belt, upon the side of which
his katana hung, encircled his waist. A crown, plainly wrought in platinum but
beautiful in its own ways gently embraced his forehead and delivered the
finishing touch to his transformation.</p>

Kannazuki Aoi let her mind flow through the sheathed Eye of Luna, which in turn
spanned it across the whole structure. There were eight rooms spacing equally
far apart from one another in a large circle, all of which faced the great
spiral staircase that led all the way up to the Audience Hall. In the room that
was due north, she sensed Tsubasa the First Head, shining bright like the
namesake of his Elemental Blade. The room on his left was occupied by Girochi
Miyako, who was still shaking in fear according to the weak and uneven pulses
she was giving off. On the other hand, her brother Girochi Tokiya, who happened
to be in the same room and probably was trying to calm his sister down, was the
exact opposite. Although he was by no means as strong as the Second Head in
term of powers, he should be much more difficult to deal with. OneÅfs powers
seldom depicted oneÅfs personality wrong, and TokiyaÅfs made Aoi think of a calm
surface of the ocean, where fierce currents ran wildly beneath. Dangerous as an
Orochi Head already, the man was even more so that Suikyou the Water Blade was
in his hand. She wondered if she could arrange an accident soon....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Aoi chuckled softly to herself. Now that she had begun to
speculate about dangerous people, she should not continue to ignore the person
that had made her way to the garden and placed herself firmly behind AoiÅfs back
without raising the softest noise. With every fiber of her existence brimming
with power like that, the Orochi Eighth Head obviously harbored no good
intentions.</p>

became a whirling blue that lashed out at Saotome MakotoÅfs throat. Aoi would
not have stopped the blade from crushing the black-caped girlÅfs cartilage had
she not heard a simple statement being whispered from the OrochiÅfs lips, <i><span

walls of pitch black shadows descended on all sides and formed a prism-shaped
dimensional prison that cut Aoi off from the real world. With it in place, none
outside could see the prison or hear a word that was spoken within its walls.
At first glance, one would have thought that this place was perfect for the
exchange of secrets, but Aoi knew better. She did not have to look at the
shimmering Tasogare, which was floating menacingly above her head, or feel the
tiniest surge of power within her Kagetsuki to know that she had been trapped
within a Power Seal, the function of which was to suppress the magical
abilities of any individual in its clutches. Saotome Makoto obviously meant to
take the upper hand.</p>

that Aoi had been correct in that the Orochi Eighth Head wanted something from
her. And as long as she did not give it, the girl would make no attempt to kill
her. Not that it would guarantee that Saotome would not resort to violence

suffered a shock at hearing the name of the God of Storms at first, the
Follower regained her composure. All that betrayed what she was feeling inside
were her tight lips, her flushed cheeks, and her blazing emerald eyes. The

had taken less than a minute for her to realize that only one Immortal in
Heaven could have revealed to Saotome Makoto the crystal structure that mainly
lay submerged beneath the surface of the Memories Sea. Izanagi or his trusted
lapdog Yuusaku would have destroyed her as soon as they met her. Aside from
those two and the Keeper of the Hall of Memories, none other had the authority
to raise the Tower of Kannazuki from the depth. Besides, the girl had named it
the Tower of Agony, which was not mentioned in any records. Aoi could still
remember her meeting with that incredibly handsome man three thousand years
ago, during which he secretly told her the name with which he had dubbed the
crystal structure. He had looked quite saddened, too, before he Sealed her in
with his own hands. ÅgAm I wrong?Åh</p>

Besides, now that she had figured out what kind of person Saotome Makoto was,
she was thinking something more along the lines of weaving the Orochi into her

could gather the cash she needed. It was also the symbol of her love toward the
person who had become more than just a part of her life. On the day following
her birthday, she had lost it and thought that she would never see it again.
Yet, now that it had returned to her, by means that she was completely ignorant
of, she had not the slightest idea what she should do with it. She couldnÅft see
why she should keep it now that her one and only significant other would never
come back to her. The sapphire ring couldnÅft be more useless now that all the

she already got the answer she sought. What they were trying to tell her
politely was that they had to confine her in the Shrine under the command of
the High Priest. What they were probably trying to do was protecting her from
the Priestess of the Moon, who very nearly killed her yesterday. She truly
appreciated their thoughts... but in that their interest and hers did not
collide. What they sought was not what she sought. She didnÅft think they would

as hot as the sun but for all its heat, it would not harm a blade of grass
unless she ordered it to. And when she did, it would obey, Himeko knew. It
seemed her grief had somehow awakened the latent powers of the Priestess of the
Sun resting inside her. It was such a great irony how she had always wanted her
powers so that she could protect the one she loved but when she actually
regained them, there was no longer any need for her to have them. It was just
like the sapphire ring.</p>

without them slipping off. A quick movement of her fingers here, a twist of her
wrist there produced a blinding flare of golden light that froze the movements
of the Priests. Their mouths were still hanging in the effort of persuading her
to stay, hands moving about to give necessary emphasis. Another time, it would
have been amusing. Another time, she would have laughed at seeing them so.
Right now, she could not care less.</p>

felt much from her body ever since she woke, either. It was as though her skin
had grown numb, her every nerve disabled. She might as well be made entirely of
rocks. She smiled &#8211; or she thought she did, her lips didnÅft seem to be moving

Hall of the Sky, had completely slipped his mind up until now. The Core was a
place of great importance, for it functioned as a Hall in which the full
Chamber of the Celestial Assembly convened every single day and decided the
businesses of the ImmortalsÅf World. Not just that, through the Mirror of Life
in the Tower of Kannazuki, the Assembly also took on the task of determining where
a mortalÅfs soul would go when they stood at the crossroads of destiny, thus
steering the wheel for the Cycle of Death and Rebirth.</p>

political center of Heaven. They were indispensable if Izanagi wanted to be
free of all the responsibility and mountains of paperwork, and they knew it.
Great powers were in their hands, theirs to wield as they deemed necessary. In
other words, corruption was but a step away. Although he could remove any, or
all, of them from office if he caught them doing something that they should not
have, it was actually more trouble than it was worth, for he had to conduct
full and formal investigations in accordance with universal laws. Besides, busy
as he was, he did not really have time to check on every single one of them. To
solve such a dilemma, he imposed one little restriction upon the structure of
the Core, one that connected the minds of all the Assembly members together in
one great telepathy network.</p>

communication and established a system of checks on each and every one of his
employees. Since he had practically opened the mind of one Assembly member to
all others in the Core, he had indirectly told them that they had better think
of nothing in there <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>except</span></i>
the businesses of the Heavenly World. And of course, should one try anything
funny with his position, the rest of them would realize it immediately and put
him in his proper place. Also, with the telepathy network in effect, the
Assembly also became the judiciary body of Izumo. The system made it possible
for them to delve into the mind of the people who were brought to the Core,
extract the pristine truth, and deliver fair judgments for all. <i><span

bastards of the Assembly requested him to extend the system so it would work on
him as well. They had backed their request with the excuse that should the
Ruler of Heaven be excluded from the effect of the Network, there was no
difference from him standing above the law, which, as they claimed, was
unacceptable in a democratic society like Izumo. Having nothing to say in response
to that, he reluctantly and grudgingly acceded to their request. He had
regretted ever since. He did even more so now that they had used the system
that he himself designed to drag classified information out of Yuusaku, his
trusted aide, and requested an audience with him.</p>

vaulting arch blocked by a pair of steel doors decorated with the shield and
sword sigil of the Celestial Assembly. Upon turning his head, he saw the Chief
Messenger standing a few feet away, faced painted with apprehension, eyes
filled with the fervent hope that Izanagi would not make him enter the Core
again. He sighed. Despite being fiercely loyal, Yuusaku did not have much
backbone. Izanagi sometimes wished that the man did so that he could make
himself more useful.</p>

throwing her tantrums and demanding to know how her daughters were faring in
the Human World, he had had no other choice but to threaten her with
AmaterasuÅfs life again before she decided to be quiet and do what he told her
to. No other alternatives could persuade the Goddess of the Moon to stay in the
Heavenly Palace.</p>

the dead center of a great square, he found himself surrounded from all sides
by the full chamber of the Celestial Assembly, five hundred Gods and Goddesses,
all clad in snowy cloaks with deep hoods, seated in rows of seats that cascaded
downward to form the shape of a bowl. Above them was a great dome beneath the
vaulted surface of which hung a myriad of glowing orbs of light.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>Izanagi grimaced. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Devious
bastards,</span></i> was the first thought that popped in his head every time
he entered the Grand Hall of the Sky. Since he was not responsible for the
design of the Core, he had no chance to know what it looked like <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>inside</span></i> before the construction
was complete. To his shock, the rows of seat in the Core was arranged in such a
way that no matter who stood before the Assembly, he would be subjected to five
hundred pairs of eyes from all directions at all times. He should never be able
to find himself unwatched for even a split second. Every movement he made would
be carefully filed away in those heads. Every wrong choice of word would be
used against him as soon as uttered. Izanagi did not believe they even needed
the mind-reading system to try the criminals. Should they keep sending their
captives such unrelenting gazes, most would be more than willing to dig out the
tiniest scrap of information that they never knew they remembered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>On one hand, Izanagi would have loved so watch some
unsuspecting soul squirm under the AssemblyÅfs attention. On the other, he had
no wish to be that unsuspecting soul. The Assembly had gained too much power
for their own good. It was high time Izanagi took some back. </p>

spoken the mouths of five hundred Immortals who bowed down at Izanagi from
where they stood. He almost gnashed his teeth in anger. There was no respect in
those calculating eyes that shone like headlights beneath the deep hoods. They
definitely had gained too much power and lost an equal amount of common sense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

intend to any time soon, if ever.</p>

crisis.Åh In a way, this very row held more powers than the rest combined, for
it seated the Three Arbiters, who belonged to the highest of the echelons, who
moderated every meeting in this Hall, who in other words had authority over the
rest. And the man who had just spoken was the most prominent, also eldest of
the Three, Ame no Minaka.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

all the rows, from Gods and Goddesses shocked to the base of their foundation.
Ame no Minaka, interestingly enough, said nothing while peering at Izanagi in
evident surprise and curiosity. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Like
a cat would a mouse,</span></i> he noted absently. The Arbiter seemed to think
very highly of himself.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>It was no secret to Izanagi that despite his restriction on
the Core, the entire Assembly was growing more and more ambitious. They had but
begun to realize that he had left much of Izumo in their jurisdiction, which in
turn implied that perhaps they could manage the Holy City without the Maker of
the World. It would not surprise him, really, to wake up one day and find his
head cut off from his body and Ame no Minaka crowned absolute ruler in his
stead. It was not like they did not want to anyway. They simply did not have
the necessary courage. As long as his two sons, Susanou and Kagutsuchi, kept a
tight watch on the Armies of Heaven, to which they were High Commanders, the Celestial
Assembly would be less than eager to plan a coup d'&eacute;tat. Also, even though the
Assembly held sway over the Mirror of Life, the one weapon capable of bringing
Izanagi down, they could not do nothing beyond deciding whether a mortalÅfs soul
would go after death. He had been quite wise in making sure that those senile
men and women could not wield the power of First Supreme any more than
necessary, if he might say so&nbsp; himself.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Still, Izanagi could not allow such threat to thrive any
longer. He needed to cut off the head of the snake before it could bare it
fangs and bite him. To make that happen, he had to eliminate all of the
Arbiters, of course. The only question was how. A power higher than his was
what had appointed those three. He must not upset that power by sentencing the
Arbiters to death without good cause. He bet that if he looked hard enough, he
would find one, though.</p>

spoke, ÅgPardon, Lord, but did I hear it correctly from you that there was no crisis?
I believe my Lord is well aware of what, or who, awaits Kannazuki Aoi in the
OrochiÅfs midst.Åh Takami no Mikoto, another Arbiter and senile old man just like
his senior officer, added, his wry voice bordering on insolence. He adored Ame
no Minaka so much that he had to get an ego as large as the Heavenly Palace,
too. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Odious little man,</span></i>

Tsurugi no Rinne wants to do with her?Åh the last of the Arbiters chimed in.
Kami no Mikoto, the only female officer in the Three, was the only one who made
herself look like a woman in her mid twenties. Despite the fact that her
appearance did please the eye, she would look quite plain beside Tsukiyomi. Not
that the woman acknowledged the fact, though. With the way she walked across
Heaven with her head held high and her nose pointing skyward, she seemed to
believe that she was the most beautiful woman in the Three Worlds. Izanagi
sometimes found himself wondering how many times a day that Kami no Mikoto
looked into her mirror and assured herself that her beauty was unsurpassed.</p>

break through the mental barrier that he had placed on his mind. <i><span

yet,</span></i> he thought. After all, he had specified before hand that the

of which were directed at Izanagi in a heated fashion. Of course it was
dangerous. Of course it was disturbing that the fool Sinner Sei no Tsurugi no

if the Assembly expected him to acknowledge that fact, they were even bigger
fools.</p>

the top of their lungs.</p>

she knew all about AoiÅfs intentions when the girl had not even a clue what
Rinne was aiming at. In this contest of strength, the Priestess of the Moon

could never guess what she was doing there in such late hour, when the entire
Academy was but deserted. No mere mortal, on the same note, could sense the
raging storm of powers inside her soul. She was calling out to her blue-haired
princess, a Priestess reaching for her beloved counterpart and the other half
of her existence. She was sending out signals that the Priestess of the Moon
should never be able to miss, wherever she was in this whole wide world. If all
went well, her sweetheart would come. If all went as Himeko expected them to,
she would be dead before the earliest light of dawn reached the earth.</p>

begging her to conclude this with her own hands, she wouldnÅft. It wasnÅft that
she couldnÅft stand the pain of ending her own life, though. It was only because

death. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>It should be okay,

Yet, her hope quickly deflated as she realized who had just entered. It was a
girl with short brown hair framing a face many would call pretty, a toned frame
of a track-and-field athlete, and a pair of emerald eyes that shone brightly in
the moonlight. The newcomer, clad in a thick jacket and a pair of worn-out
jeans, was someone who Himeko thought didnÅft want anything to do with her ever

quick and casual response shocked her so much that she fell silent for a few

the most obvious thing in the world. ÅgIt was around eight thirty when I got
there. To my surprise, I found a bunch of panicking Priests instead of my
cuddly roommate.Åh The other girl giggled softly, and she colored in spite of
herself. Since the track-and-field athlete practiced in the evening once in a
blue moon, it was very late into the night when she returned to the room they
shared. After that, the girl would take a bath before she climbed onto HimekoÅfs
mattress instead of her own, which was on the upper level of the double-decked
bed. And whenever that happened, she found absolutely no rest afterwards. It
wasnÅft as though she had problems with sleeping next to her best friend. It was
just that the latter tended to hold onto her very tightly when she slept.
Himeko asked the track-and-field athlete once why she didnÅft sleep on her own
mattress. Her roommate had replied in a half-joking, half-serious, voice that
on the upper level, there was no pillow that was as cuddly and smelled as good.
Blushing, Himeko had chosen to believe that Mako-chan had been too tired to
climb up the ladder after she returned.</p>

such incredible scenery.... Izanagi would have smiled in contentment and in awe

The woman was in fact double-crossing both the Immortals of Heaven and her own

benefited the most in the end. Should the Orochi Followers succeed in
