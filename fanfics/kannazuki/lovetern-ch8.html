margin-bottom:.15in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Oogami Souma was deeply immersed in a disturbing dream that
replayed the scene at the beach, where his childhood friend firmly rejected
him, when electric shock rippled along every fiber of his existence and woke
him up in a violent start. He fell from his bed in a loud thud. The pain that
swept out from his back upon crashing against the wooden floor, however, was
nothing compared to the sensation that was tearing his body into pieces. He was
under the impression that a thousand needles were nettling his skin and an
equal number of swords piercing his heart. He wanted to scream out so badly to
release the mind-numbing pressure that was building rapidly inside him... yet
he couldnÅft, for a lump was smothering any sound trying to come up his throat.
Thrashing like a fish out of water on the floor, he could only clutch at his
chest and wondered in pain and rage why such a thing like this was happening to
him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;
margin-bottom:.15in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>All of a sudden, his hands started to glow brilliantly
purple in the dim light of the morning coming into his curtained window. From
them the lightning came and concentrated into one single point in the confined
space of his room. In one flash of ominous light, Raien the Lightning Blade
came into existence. With the appearance of the Sword, his physical agony
increased ten-fold. He found himself fervently wishing that the Elemental Blade
had run him through instead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Damn you,
Raien!</span></i> he cursed bitterly. It would seem that his worst fear had
come true. Paying absolutely no heed to the advice of the High Priest &#8211; which
he couldnÅft possibly follow given his situation anyway &#8211; he had tapped far too
much into the power of the Lightning Blade. Now he had to pay the price for
letting the soul of Raien invaded his own body. With his own soul, of course.
He could feel the suction force the Sword was exerting upon him. He could hear
its seductive voice singing softly in his head, urging him to let his guard
down and allow it to <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>unite</span></i>
with him while trying to pull his consciousness into its folds at the same
time. He never imagined that Raien could be so shrewd a Sword.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>YouÅfre not

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>He focused his willpower into holding his ground against the
Sword. After a vicious struggle with the cramp that had been ravaging his body,
he managed to roll onto his stomach. Then he wielded every ounce of strength he
could conjure to crawl toward the Sword while feeling as though he was carrying
a boulder on his back. He knew that if he could just snatch the damned weapon,
he might be able to impose his will upon the thing, seize control over its
soul, and end this torment. Of course, it also involved the risk of having his
own soul sucked into the Sword and imprisoned in there forever while that of Raien
itself walked the Earth in his own body. The thing would probably return
immediately to the side of its Master the Dark God and aided him in destroying
the world. It was a scary thought, he must admit, but it wasnÅft as though he
had a choice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Souma never managed to discover what could have happened, it
turned out. When he, after having advanced at the speed of a snail during the
last fifteen minutes, had his right hand but an inch away from the blade of the
Sealed Sword, the thing pulsed fiercely with flashes of purple light and hurled
him against his bed. Souma gritted his teeth in utmost pain a swarm of colorful
butterflies stormed across his vision. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Damn
you!</span></i> he cursed again. Now, hopelessness rather than anger was
welling in him. He could hear the footstep of doom coming nearer and nearer
within every second that passed. His soul was slipping slowly away from his
grasp. In but a few minutes, it would no longer belong to him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;
margin-bottom:.15in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>It was only then did he realize that he was not alone in the
room. Sitting cross-legged atop his desk at this very moment was a girl he had
never seen before in his life. She was beautiful with her heart-shaped face,
with her gray eyes that could suck in a manÅfs soul and keep it there forever,
with her long platinum-golden hair that parted somewhere behind her back and
wreathed around her slender body like living water streams. The stiff collar of
her long and snowy cape, lined with golden and silver threads and fluttering
gently in the room despite the deathly stillness of the air, bore a crystal
brooch in the shape of two pairs of angelic wings on either side. Souma sensed
his stomach lurch. Although this girl was good-looking enough to make Himemiya
Chikane look plain in comparison, she instilled something fear into him rather
and admiration and worship. In front of him now was a Goddess carved from
eternal ice and not a single scrap of human emotion. In front of him now was a
doll that could strike fear out of the bravest heart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;
margin-bottom:.15in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>It suddenly struck him that perhaps the supplier of his
trouble this morning wasnÅft Raien after all. Tortured as he was, he could still
feel the faint resonance of power between the stranger girl and the Sealed
Sword. Yes, there was no mistake. In one way or another, she had succeeded in
wrestling the control of his own weapon away from him and decided that she
would use it to finish him off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;
margin-bottom:.15in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>ÅgIt would seem that you prefer to prolong your suffering,
Seventh Child of the Orochi,Åh the girl said, her voice carrying the full force
of an artic wind. ÅgToo bad, I have not the time to play with you.Åh Her gray
eyes became alight at the same time that power erupted within the Sealed Sword.
ÅgThis is farewell.Åh Her words rang across the room like the tolls of the bells
of judgment while her right hand made a soft but sweeping motion from left to
right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;
margin-bottom:.15in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>An invisible force lifted Souma up from the floor, slammed
him against the wall behind his bed, and pinned him there. Although the impact
hurt him so much he could only let out a wordless cry, he was still able to
realize how feeble he was against the platinum-haired intruder. Unseen binds
were restraining his limbs. RaienÅfs influence was disrupting the flow of his
power, depriving him of the ability to save his own hide. All he could do was
watch as the Lightning Blade, now balanced horizontally in the air, drew nearer
and nearer toward his heart. Hopelessness all but seized him when the tip of
the Sealed Sword touched the fabric of his sweat-drenched T-shirt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;
margin-bottom:.15in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Raien suddenly rang visibly in the air and hurled itself
sideways, consequently making a cut on SoumaÅfs shirt but failing to inflict any
wound upon his skin as it traveled to the other side of the room and plunged
into a wall afterwards. The girlÅfs gray eyes widened a fraction in surprise.
She had to be realizing that whatever spell she had cast from the beginning of
it all was being undone. She had to be noticing that torrential power was
returning to SoumaÅfs body again while his bindings were being unraveled as
quickly as they had been made. Her delicate mouth thinned into a straight line
in anger. It was odd, seeing emotion on her stone-cold face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;
margin-bottom:.15in;margin-left:.5in'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅgRaien!Åh</span></i><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> he roared as he swung his hand toward
the Sealed Sword. The Lightning Blade pulled itself out of the wall and flew
back into his grasp. Incinerating the final restraints on his body with his
weaponÅfs fine lightning flows, Souma landed on his feet upon the bed, ready to
launch his most deadly attacks against his enemy. He wouldnÅft mind if he ended
up destroying in own room in the process. The only thing he cared about at the
moment was the elimination of the stranger girl, who seemed to be able to
control Raien at will. Yet, when he looked up again, she was no longer there.
The room was once again empty save for himself. There was no trace left of the
person who had just attempted to remove him from this world.</span></p>

took. ÅgEverythingÅfs fine,Åh he lied.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgBut....Åh A shake of SoumaÅfs head cut the older man short.
ÅgVery well,Åh his adoptive brother said in resignation in the end. Terribly
curious he might be, he still knew that if Souma didnÅft want to talk about
something, nothing could force him to.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>He sat down in a slump on the bed, his head spinning from the
slew of questions blaring noisily inside. Who the hell was that girl? And why
was she aiming for his life? And what had happened that stopped her from
succeeding? He didnÅft think she was an Orochi. All seven of them he had already
met. Each and every of their faces were already carved into his memory too
deeply to be forgotten. True, he never discovered the real identity of the
Eighth Head... but he was fairly certain that this girl was not her. The senses
of power they gave out were heavens and earth apart. But then, with that reason
excluded, he couldnÅft really understand why someone out of the ranks of the
Orochi would want to kill him. It didnÅft make sense at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgSouma, now that you are already awake, thereÅfs an errand IÅfd
like you to run for me,Åh Kazuki-nii-san said, his voice strangely serious.
Souma had a feeling that it was no coincidence that the man was outside his
room when he was being attacked. The older man must have been about to wake him
up for the <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>errand </span></i>he
just spoke of. He glanced at the clock on his desk, which read seven in the
morning, then turned his attention back to the High Priest, who was looking
straight at Souma with an odd expression on his face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgWhat is it, nii-san?Åh he asked. He barely succeeded in
keeping the suspicion out of his voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The High Priest then dumped another puzzle on SoumaÅfs already
mountain-high pile by telling him what he needed to do and where he had to go.
Honest to the heavens above, the action Souma had to undertake and the name of
his destination did not sound even remotely well together in light of what
happened during his date yesterday. Still, what disturbed him most of all about
this so-called <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>errand</span></i>
was the last line his brother had told him before the man left his room, <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅgMay the Gods be with you.Åh</span></i>
Chills slithered down SoumaÅfs spine. </p>

"Times New Roman"'>Upon re-materialization atop the tiled roof of ShingetsuÅfs
Grand Hall, Rinne found herself being thoroughly scrutinized by two girls who
stood but half a dozen feet away. The twins &#8211; no chance they were not, for they
resembled one another like two petals of the same flower &#8211; had slender builds,
long dark hair that fell to their waists, identically pretty faces, and a pair
of penetrating dark eyes that were radiating too much defiance for their own
good.</span></p>

been for them, she would have succeeded in taking the soul of the traitorous
Orochi Seventh Head. Had it not been for them, she would have been one step
nearer to her own goal. She could not believe such a good opportunity had
slipped out of her hand just like that. Now that Raien was safely under the
traitorÅfs control again, there could be no telling when it could rise up once
again against its owner so that Rinne could be given one more chance at
eliminating the little eyesore. Furthermore, once Oogami Souma had learned of
the consequences to his tapping too far into the Sealed SwordÅfs powers, he
would take steps to prevent them from happening again, Rinne was sure. Anger
erupted in her like the content of a volcano that had been fuming for weeks.</span></p>

margin-bottom:.15in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

could take out her anger on the twins, she could feel somewhat better. A quick
assessment of their celestial strength, however, disabused her of the
intention. Despite being slightly weaker than either of the Goddesses Amaterasu
and Tsukiyomi, they were still too powerful for Rinne to handle. At the moment,
they could snuff out her existence anytime they wished.</span></p>

issued by a stranger. No matter who the twins could be, they were definitely
dangerous. She only wondered if they were from Izumo. Probably not, she decided
quickly. There were very few High Immortals in Heaven who could match either of
the twins in power, and Rinne knew them inside out. Besides, the residents of
the World of the Gods could have no business with her, the exile, the Eternal
Sinner who was hated with a passion by their liege Lord.</span></p>

instinctively took a step backward at a thought of the female Maker of the
World, at the explanation that just dawned upon her, and at the possibilities
that it unleashed. It was no secret that given her kind-hearted nature, Izanami
did not exactly take a liking to the way Rinne had been operating and scheming
in the darkness of the Human World, pulling on strings of mortals and Orochi
Heads alike. Worse, since the Regent was not as inflexible as Izanagi with
regards to the rule forbidding divine intervention to human affair, she could
easily ignore it and go after Rinne herself. And if Izanami decided to do just
that.... Rinne shivered.</span></p>

next to her burst into tears, something she did not expect her to do from the
moment the latter contacted her from the Human World. To her, Amaterasu had
been one unflappable Goddess, one undaunted by the fate awaiting her at the end
of the line. Izanami admired her and loved her for it. Never in her wildest
dream did she think that a girl with such incredibly strong will would shed her
tears uncontrollably so. On the other hand, however, her emotions were hardly
unjustified. Tsukiyomi the Goddess of the Moon was ever AmaterasuÅfs weakness.
If IzanamiÅfs daughter wished it, the Goddess of the Sun would probably serve
her head on a tray even before the former could finish delivering her order.
She just loved her that much.</p>

girl was as much her daughter as Tsukiyomi now, so the despair that was
devouring her inside out was doing no less damage to IzanamiÅfs heart. ÅgI was

she raised her vacant hand and waved to her while a smile no less brilliant
than that of her childhood friend curved her own lips. Curiously enough, the

land behind the Heavenly Palace where Izanagi had taken much time and effort to
capture the beauty of nature in its entirety. Izanami must say that the placeÅfs
haughty name was a very good description of what lay within it. The way he
arranged the waterfalls in every possible size, the numerous kinds of flower

Onogoro, Tsukiyomi had brought back the thing because she said she liked greatly

mirror unlike any other in the world. The object had two faces, one shinier
than the surface of a pond in summer, the other blacker than the darkest ink.
Around its circular rim was a ring of diamond, carved with ancient characters
that spelled out one of the most dangerous incantations ever made. Even high in
the air, those words were as visible to Izanami as day. Goosebumps rose all

ultimate magical entity in the Creation Realm. Izanagi was supposed to keep it
safe amidst the Memories Sea, where no hand save the KeeperÅfs could touch, as
far as she was concerned. The reason dawned on her quickly. The Keeper of the Memories
Hall, an ancient Immortal whose powers were not enough to sustain his youth,
was nearing retirement, so he allowed his Apprentice, Susanou, to rule in all
but name. The young God of Storms, idolizing his elder sister as he was, must
have handed the Mirror to Amaterasu without a second thought.</span></i></p>

Supreme was not something even High Immortals of their caliber should trifle
with, in any event. In the beginning, the two Makers, Izanagi and Izanami
herself, created the object to guide the passages of the human souls and to
guarantee them an uninterrupted Cycle of Death and Rebirth. For that purpose
alone, Inochi no Kagami had been granted so much power that its scope now

the fatigue, Izanami took Tsukiyomi back to Reiha, relying on the excuse that
her daughter had received all the necessary Blessing and Acceptance of the

survive in her domain. She could stay there for a while, a weekÅfs time perhaps,
but not her whole life. Since Amaterasu was not a Reiha-born Immortal, she
needed time to grow immune to the power of the Crystal Roses. However, she
would die before it could happen, for the Sealing Field cut her off from the

tied Amaterasu to the Sun by all means possible to make sure she would not
forget her duties to Izumo, to Heaven, and to him. Although Izanami had had to
abandon Amaterasu, she had left something with the girl, to make sure her
father could not harm her out of anger and jealousy. Izanami had entrusted to
Amaterasu her greatest weapon, </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

the beginning, Izanami only wanted to retreat to Reiha to find a way to reunite

Meanwhile, the lovesick TsukiyomiÅfs health degenerated badly. Her daughter was
practically dying right in front of her eyes while she could do nothing to
help.</span></p>

into the Underworld all by himself. From what she could gather, the manÅfs
purpose was not to save the world because of the sudden cool-down of the Sun.
The creep only came into Reiha to take back Tsukiyomi. The Lord of Izumo was
not aware of the Sealing FieldÅfs existence, though, so he ended up in her
custody instead. Izanami then decided to detain the despicable creep, hoping to
force him to agree to the arrangements she made for Tsukiyomi and Amaterasu.
Izanagi was too stubborn, however, so she had no choice but to keep him there

She was too busy to let the young Goddess of the Moon into the plan.
Consequently, the girl was kept in the dark. She probably thought that Izanami
was imprisoning Izanagi because of her own anger, not IzanamiÅfs love for her.
The only logical solution she could think of at that moment to go back to
Amaterasu was to free Izanagi... which she did. Come to think of it, such
incident was partly IzanamiÅfs fault. Had she told her daughter everything,
perhaps Tsukiyomi and Amaterasu would not have had to suffer so.</span></p>

room to room, hallway to hallway, and flight of stairs after flight of stairs.

tried to figure whether she was their young mistressÅfs secret lover, not the

hoping fervently that she could be in time. Not that she cared whether they

ended up in hot soup. Himemiya Chikane, despite being caught off guard and
having failed in recapturing the Heads before they vanished into the silvery
surface, realized that the person who wove the Portal was still there. The girl
then immediately established an immense Sealing Field upon the area in an
attempt to catch whoever that was. Had Rinne not reacted quickly, she would
have been turned into a fish in a net. That would have been extremely

shared a family name with Aoi despite them being not related by blood, was
still shaking her head in denial. The girl did not seem able to believe a word

feelings inside our hearts. It was inevitable. Yet, along with love came the
anxiety. We knew it was forbidden by the Laws of Heaven for two girls to fall
in love. We were but aware of the disaster waiting to snatch us into its midst
should we be found out. There were times I cried by myself in the dark, fearful

protection. He looked down, feeling cold sweat soaking the back of his shirt. A

pointed downward. A heartbeat later, she let it go. Upon being struck by the

heartbeat had passed before he began to ask himself why he bothered to do so.

stars seized the chance and hit him one after another. Souma didnÅft have time,
or even the strength to scream out loud as his whole body was thrown violently
from one place to another in the sky just to be slammed face down on the grassy
surface of the earth in the very end. With his face half buried in the ground,
he felt his muscles and his nerves unravel. He felt numb, he felt cold, but he
