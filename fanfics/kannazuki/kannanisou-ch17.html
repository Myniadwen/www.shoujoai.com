<h1>Spiral of Destiny (part 17 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kannazuki/index.html">Kannazuki no Miko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nwarford.html">Nathan Warford</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kannazuki/kannanisou-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>By the time they had reached the North American mainland, Chikane and 
Himeko had closed the gap between Ame no Murakumo and Yokusemi no 
Mizuchi by nearly a third. However, when they encountered the mainland, 
they also encountered the destruction that awaited them. New York city 
had suffered the same fate that Beijing had. Skyscrapers had been razed 
to the ground and everything that could burn was burning. Even the 
Statue of Liberty had been demolished.

As they traveled across the continental United States, Chikane and 
Himeko did not see anything different than what they saw in New York. 
Everything under Ame no Murakumo&#39;s feet looked like a war zone. The 
sight reminded them of photographs that they had seen pertaining to the 
atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

&quot;It&#39;s Hi no Ashinazuchi, isn&#39;t it, Chikane?&quot; Himeko said.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Chikane replied. &quot;Only Girochi&#39;s Megaton Knuckle causes blast 
patterns like this.&quot;

Approaching the West Coast, Chikane and Himeko were surprised to see 
many of the San Francisco Bay Area&#39;s landmarks still intact, including 
Mount Diablo, the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, and the Golden Gate 
Bridge. &quot;Where&#39;s Girochi?&quot; Chikane wondered.

&quot;Megaton Knuckle Two!&quot; Girochi&#39;s voice boomed.

&quot;Chikane! Behind you!&quot; cried Himeko. Ame no Murakumo spun around to 
confront Hi no Ashinazuchi. However, the god of swords was hit by a blow 
to the side, dealt by Yokusemi no Mizuchi. Chikane and Himeko had just 
enough time to see Hi no Ashinazuchi&#39;s fist fly by them, blasting 
through Mount Diablo before Ame no Murakumo hit the ground. The Megaton 
Knuckle touched down on Yerba Buena Island, producing a blinding light 
and a subsequent mushroom cloud. The priestesses could only watch as the 
shockwave from the explosion ripped up the Bay Bridge, knocked over the 
Golden Gate Bridge, and disintegrated most of the land known as the San 
Francisco Bay Area.

By the time Chikane and Himeko got to their feet, Girochi hand landed in 
front of them, his other self having come out of its oversized right 
arm, the color of its body now purple instead of orange. &quot;It&#39;s been a 
while, Priestesses,&quot; Girochi said.

&quot;You&#39;ve destroyed the entire continental United States,&quot; said Chikane.

&quot;They had it coming,&quot; Girochi retorted. &quot;You of all people should know 
the destruction that they&#39;ve caused. After all, it was your soil that 
they dropped those nuclear bombs on. I&#39;m just returning the favor for 
you.&quot;

&quot;You know that&#39;s not your true intention,&quot; growled Chikane. Ame no 
Murakumo rushed at Hi no Ashinazuchi, driving its sword toward Orochi&#39;s 
third body.

&quot;Please,&quot; Girochi said as he calmly watching the giant mech rush at him. 
Hi no Ashinazuchi punched the ground with its right fist, propelling 
itself into the air, straight over Ame no Murakumo. Landing behind the 
Priestesses, Girochi cried, &quot;Eat this!&quot; Hi no Ashinazuchi shot chains 
out from its left arm toward Ame no Murakumo.

Chikane clutched the Lunar Priestess Blade, ready to counter Girochi&#39;s 
attack. Chikane swung the sword in her hand and Ame no Murakumo swung 
the blade on its right wrist in exactly the same way its pilot did. The 
blade spun around the wrist as quickly as its arm swung, Hi no 
Ashinazuchi&#39;s chains cut to shreds in the flurry.

&quot;Megaton Knuckle Three!&quot; The Orochi mech curled up inside its right arm 
again and flew at Ame no Murakumo. The god of swords caught Hi no 
Ashinazuchi, keeping it from moving. The ground beneath Ame no 
Murakumo&#39;s feet began to crack as the god struggled against the force of 
Hi no Ashinazuchi&#39;s rockets.

As Chikane was preoccupied with Girochi, Yokusemi no Mizuchi flew up 
behind Ame no Murakumo and transformed into its drill shape. &quot;Chikane,&quot; 
said Himeko. &quot;Yokusemi no Mizuchi is right behind us.&quot;

&quot;Just tell me when,&quot; responded Chikane. The drill-shaped mech flew 
toward Ame no Murakumo. &quot;Tell me when,&quot; Chikane said again.

&quot;Not yet,&quot; said Himeko. Yokusemi drew closer. &quot;Not yet...&quot; The eighth 
body was inches from Ame no Murakumo&#39;s back. Finally, Himeko called, 
&quot;Now!&quot;

Chikane cried out as Ame no Murakumo used all of its strength to lift Hi 
no Ashinazuchi over its head. &quot;Oh shit!&quot; Girochi cried as he saw 
Yokusemi no Mizuchi flying right towards him. In a flash, Yokusemi no 
Mizuchi transformed back into its bird shape and used its wings to brake 
itself, giving Girochi just enough time to pull up before plowing 
straight through four of his fellow Orochi. The jet of hot air blowing 
from Hi no Ashinazuchi&#39;s rockets knocked Yokusemi no Mizuchi 
off-balance, causing it to fall to the ground.

A beam of yellow light fired from the spike of Ame no Murakumo&#39;s head, 
hitting Hi no Ashinazuchi, causing it to explode is a giant fireball 
similar to the one that was produced when it had hit ground zero. Ame no 
Murakumo turned around toward Yokusemi no Mizuchi and jumped into the 
air, the blade in its right foot extending. The bird-shaped mech had 
nowhere to go but up, so it was inevitable that Ame no Murakumo would 
slice clean through it.

However, Yokusemi no Mizuchi used a tactic that none of the other Orochi 
bodies could use. It transformed back into its drill shaped and dug 
straight down into the earth to avoid Ame no Murakumo&#39;s blade. Himeko 
and Chikane watched as Yokusemi no Mizuchi, now in its bird form again, 
flew out from the water of the former San Francisco Bay, and continue 
flying west.

Ame no Murakumo started giving chase again, but Yokusemi no Mizuchi 
suddenly made a sharp U-turn and started heading southeast. Himeko and 
Chikane were momentarily disoriented as the high-speed mech blew past 
them. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; cried Himeko.

Chikane had to bring Ame no Murakumo to a quick stop before it overshot 
Yokusemi no Mizuchi by too far. She spun the giant god around and fired 
its rockets as strongly as they would take. The gravitational forces 
knocked Himeko and Chikane off-balance, but Ame no Murakumo was now 
heading straight after Yokusemi no Mizuchi once again.

&quot;Are you all right, Himeko?&quot; Chikane asked, seeing that Himeko had 
fallen over. &quot;You&#39;re not hurt, are you?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Himeko replied, standing up again. &quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve been counting down the Necks of Orochi,&quot; Chikane noted. &quot;First 
there was Souma, the Seventh Neck, then there were Nekoko, the Sixth 
Neck, then Rehko, the Fifth Neck, and then Korona, the Fourth Neck. And 
now just fought Girochi, the Third Neck.&quot;

&quot;Does that mean the next Orochi we encounter will be Miyako?&quot; Himeko 
asked.

&quot;I&#39;d bet my life on it,&quot; said Chikane.

As they continued southeast, Chikane and Himeko could see large, dark 
clouds looming over South America. Despite the distance from the storm, 
they could clearly see flashes of lightning streaking down from the 
clouds to the ground. &quot;I think this is the Amazon,&quot; Chikane said. &quot;This 
could mean big trouble. October is the rainy season in the Southern 
Hemisphere, so the river is most likely flooded. And since Yatsu no 
Onokoshizuchi&#39;s attacks are lightening-based...&quot;

&quot;Then Miyako could electrify the entire river!&quot; Himeko finished.

&quot;Here we go,&quot; Chikane said as they passed under the clouds. Lightning 
flashed around Ame no Murakumo as it made its way through the 
rainforest. The large spike of Ame no Murakumo&#39;s head reached high above 
the trees, acting as a lightening rod to draw the lightening away from 
the forest, and the god&#39;s metal body allowed the electricity to pass 
safely to the ground so that the priestesses would not be harmed.

Himeko and Chikane found Yatsu no Onokoshizuchi in the rainforest at the 
base of the Andes, its tentacles reaching above the treetops, sending 
lightening bolts into the sky. &quot;Sister Miyako!&quot; Chikane called.

&quot;You made it, Priestesses,&quot; Miyako&#39;s voice came from the purple mech. 
&quot;Welcome to my sanctuary.&quot;

&quot;Is this revenge for the destruction of your church?&quot; Chikane asked.

&quot;Destruction of her church?&quot; asked Himeko.

&quot;When I was alone in the Orochi realm last year,&quot; explained Chikane, &quot;I 
saw the experiences of all the Orochi that I had defeated. The event 
that Miyako experienced that allowed Orochi to consume her was the 
destruction of her church in the Alto Cenepa War between Ecuador and 
Peru.&quot;

&quot;There was so much senseless killing,&quot; said Miyako. &quot;I asked God how he 
could let such conflicts continue, but he would not answer. How can I 
let this kind of a world continue to exist, a world where people kill 
other people senselessly?&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t that exactly what you&#39;re doing, Sister?&quot; said Chikane. &quot;Killing 
people senselessly?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m ridding the world of the people that killed my family!&quot; Miyako 
cried, Yatsu no Onokoshizuchi aiming its tentacles toward Ame no 
Murakumo. &quot;How can I stand by and let these murderers continue to 
exist?&quot; Powerful bolts of lightening fired from Yatsu no Onokoshizuchi&#39;s 
tentacles at Ame no Murakumo.

Chikane raised Ame no Murakumo&#39;s right arm, the blade on its wrist 
absorbing Miyako&#39;s electric attack. Even though Ame no Murakumo&#39;s metal 
body acted as a ground for the electricity, Chikane and Himeko could 
still feel the shock. Chikane shook it off and rushed at Miyako. Yatsu 
no Onokoshizuchi continued firing lightening and the God of Swords and 
Ame no Murakumo dodged its attacks. Chikane was about to impale the 
Orochi body when Ame no Murakumo was suddenly immobilized. Yastu no 
Onokoshizuchi&#39;s arms had extended and had grabbed Ame no Murakumo&#39;s 
arms, rendering its blade useless. Chikane would have hit Miyako with a 
blast of energy from Ame no Murakumo&#39;s wings, but Yatsu no Onokoshizuchi 
was holding the god of swords with its back to her, so firing would not 
do any good. Chikane attempted to use the blades on the sword god&#39;s feet 
to cut off Yatsu no Onokoshizuchi&#39;s arms, but the drills on the Orochi 
bodies tentacles deflected Ame no Murakumo&#39;s kicks.

&quot;Send God my regards,&quot; said Miyako as the remaining tentacles opened up, 
preparing to fire all of its electricity at the priestesses. With Ame no 
Murakumo suspended, there was no ground to absorb the electricity that 
was about to shoot through its body.

Ame no Murakumo&#39;s green eyes shone and the rockets on its back fired. 
Ame no Murakumo twice the size of Yatsu no Onokoshizuchi, it easily 
ripped Yatsu no Onokoshizuchi&#39;s arms off, allowing it to set its feet on 
the ground again, making it able to absorb Miyako&#39;s electric attack with 
its blade and pass it to the earth below. As soon as the surge of 
electricity had passed, Ame no Murakumo jumped onto Yatsu no 
Onokoshizuchu&#39;s head, stabbing it with the blades on its feet. The 
Orochi body exploded, sending out a shockwave that Ame no Murakumo used 
to propel itself over the Andes and over the Pacific Ocean after 
Yokusemi no Mizuchi, which had already departed.

&quot;Now comes the hard part,&quot; Chikane said

&quot;Hard part?&quot; said Himeko.

&quot;The only Orochi we have left to defeat is Tsubasa. And his other self, 
Take no Yasukunazuchi, can fly. That means that he can show up any time, 
anywhere. Focus, Himeko.&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot; The Solar Mark lit up as Himeko tried to home in on Orochi&#39;s 
First Neck.

----------

As they flew over the Pacific, Himeko and Chikane could see smoke rising 
from the horizon. &quot;I think we&#39;ve found Take no Yasukunazuchi,&quot; Himeko 
said. As they approached the smoke, they saw that it was rising from a 
small speck of land, only a few miles wide, sitting in the middle of the 
Pacific Ocean. &quot;Where are we?&quot; Himeko wondered.

&quot;This is all that remains of the Hawaiian Islands,&quot; an ominous male 
voice said. Himeko and Chikane looked to see Take no Yasukunazuchi fly 
down and land in front of them, its wings retracting. &quot;This small bit of 
land that we are standing on used to be the big island of Hawaii.&quot;

&quot;Then that smoke must be Mauna Loa,&quot; said Chikane.

&quot;Actually, it&#39;s Kilauea,&quot; Tsubasa responded. &quot;Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa 
now both exist about ten kilometers below the ocean.&quot;

&quot;Well you&#39;ve been hard at work. Tearing down the tallest mountain in the 
world with only Take no Yasukunazuchi&#39;s swords.&quot;

&quot;They are the swords that defeated the Take no Yamikazuchi that Souma 
piloted the last time he and I fought. Let&#39;s see how you fair against 
them.&quot; Take no Yasukunazuchi unsheathed the sword imbedded in its left 
arm and Ame no Murakumo extended the blade on its wrist. Even against a 
god twice his other self&#39;s size, Tsubasa showed no fear as he rushed at 
Chikane. Take no Yasukunazuchi jumped up toward Ame no Murakumo&#39;s torso, 
the Orochi body&#39;s wings extending. With Take no Yasukunazuchi at 
practically the same height as Ame no Murakumo, the two mechs fought on 
equal footing. Even though Tsubasa&#39;s blade was half the size of Ame no 
Murakumo&#39;s, the influence of Orochi fueled his power, giving his blade 
the strength to stand up against Chikane&#39;s attacks. Himeko remembered 
Souma easily slicing Take no Yasukunazuchi&#39;s blade in half the year 
before when he was piloting Ame no Murakumo. Orochi&#39;s first body had no 
pilot that time, substantially diminishing its power and ability to 
stand up against the God of Swordsmen.

As they fought, Take no Yasukunazuchi took to the sky and Ame no 
Murakumo used its power of levitation to follow. The two mechs ducked 
over and under one another, their swords clashing only periodically. 
Tsubasa was effective in buying time by evading most of Ame no 
Murakumo&#39;s attacks and blocking those that he could not evade.

&quot;Fantastic,&quot; said Tsubasa. &quot;You truly are formidable, Lunar Priestess.&quot; 
Take no Yasukunazuchi flew at Ame no Murakumo and swung its sword. Ame 
no Murakumo caught Take no Yasukunazuchi&#39;s wrist and swung with its own 
blade, only to have its arm caught by Take no Yasukunazuchi as well. 
&quot;This wouldn&#39;t be nearly as fun against someone of lesser ability,&quot; 
Tsubasa continued.

&quot;I agree,&quot; said Chikane. &quot;We do seem to be equally matched. However, 
when fighting the God of Swords...&quot; Ame no Murakumo raised its left arm, 
causing Take no Yasukunazuchi&#39;s right arm to rise as well. As soon as 
the two mechs&#39; elbows touched, the sword still imbedded it Take no 
Yasukunazuchi&#39;s right arm started spinning, slicing off the arm that it 
was embedded in. The arm, still holding the sword that Tsubasa had been 
using up until that point, fell into the sea and the sword that had 
sliced off that arm was firmly connected to Ame no Murakumo&#39;s left 
wrist, taking the place of the blade that had been dissolved during 
Chikane&#39;s battle with Korona! &quot;...a sword isn&#39;t the best weapon for 
you,&quot; Chikane finished her sentence. Before Tsubasa could react to what 
Chikane had done, Ame no Murakumo cut Take no Yasukunazuchi in half.

&quot;Wonderful, Chikane!&quot; cried Himeko. &quot;You repaired the damaged blade by 
taking his!&quot;

&quot;Most impressive, Lunar Priestess,&quot; Tsubasa&#39;s voice said from Yokusemi 
no Mizuchi.

&quot;You managed to defeat all seven of us,&quot; came the voice of Korona.

&quot;But the battle has not even started yet,&quot; said Souma. Yokusemi no 
Mizuchi continued its journey northwest and Ame no Murakumo followed.

&quot;If I can shoot them down,&quot; Chikane said, &quot;I can end this right here and 
now.&quot;

&quot;Do we really have to destroy them?&quot; Himeko asked.

&quot;We don&#39;t have a choice,&quot; replied Chikane. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Himeko. I know 
it&#39;s a terrible fate, having to fight our friends to save the world. But 
when we remake the world, maybe we can revive Souma as well.&quot;

Beams of light shot from the spike on Ame no Murakumo&#39;s head at Yokusemi 
no Mizuchi. Although it was still able to dodge the shots fired at it, 
evading the blasts caused the bird-shaped mech to lose ground, allowing 
Ame no Murakumo to catch up with it. The closer that Ame no Murakumo 
got, the more accurate its shots were. Finally, after a long time, Ame 
no Murakumo was able to clip Yokusemi no Mizuchi&#39;s right wing with one 
of its shots. Without a fully functional right wing, the Orochi body&#39;s 
balance was thrown off, and it had to sacrifice more speed to stay on 
course.

&quot;You&#39;re mine now,&quot; Chikane said as Ame no Murakumo prepared to fire one 
last shot at the only remaining Orochi body. The Sword God fired and hit 
Yokusemi no Mizuchi&#39;s tail, causing it to spin wildly out of control. 
&quot;Got them!&quot; Chikane cried happily.

----------

Takeshi opened up his arms, exposing himself to the dark aura in front 
of him that was Orochi. The ball of energy flew at Takeshi, surrounding 
and penetrating his body. The man groaned as the power of Orochi 
overwhelmed his human body and senses. His body started growing in size, 
ripping his clothes, his spine became visible through his back and 
extended to form a tail, and spikes started growing on his head. In a 
matter of seconds, Takeshi&#39;s body had transformed into that of a 
monster. A bright beam of light surrounded the creature that had 
appeared and shot upward, through the ceiling and out through the roof 
of the mansion.

----------

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Himeko asked at seeing a bright beam of light rising from 
the ground in front of them.

&quot;That&#39;s my house!&quot; Chikane realized. Yokusemi no Mizuchi managed to 
regain its control just long enough to fly directly into the beam 
extending from the Himemiya estate. As the bird-shaped mech entered the 
beam, more beams of light shot towards Yokusemi no Mizuchi, orange and 
green beams from the west, a green-yellow beam from the northwest, 
yellow and purple beams from the northeast, a black beam from the east, 
and a blue beam rising from downtown Mahoroba. All of the beams 
coalesced into one spot, the spot where a monstrous creature with yellow 
eyes was curled up in a cocoon levitating inside the beam shooting from 
the mansion.

As the eight beams of light merged, Chikane and Himeko could see the 
eight bodies of Orochi reappear and gather around the creature. A light 
exploded from that point where the mechs joined so bright that it must 
have been visible from all parts of Japan. As the light died down and 
the dust settled, the priestesses could see in front of them the fusion 
of all of the Orochi bodies; a mechanical beast twice the height of Ame 
no Murakumo with an evil, purple coloration and glowing, yellow eyes, 
just as evil as the eyes that Chikane had seen in her father controlled 
by Orochi&#39;s will; the most powerful Orochi mech, Gattai Orochi.

To be continued...

----------

OMAKE:

The Orochi members did all that they could to keep Yokusemi no Mizuchi 
on course toward the beam of light rising from the Himemiya estate. The 
Orochi bodies reappeared within the beam, all of the cockpits merging as 
Gattai Orochi formed. The seven Necks looked down upon Ame no Murakumo, 
only half the height of the mech that they were now controlling.

&quot;Hey, what&#39;s that?&quot; said Souma, noticing an object sitting in Tsubasa&#39;s 
corner of the cockpit.

&quot;NYAAAA!!!!!&quot; cried Nekoko upon seeing that it was the magazine that she 
had seen before.

Souma opened the magazine and peeked inside. At first, his eyes bulged, 
but then they narrowed he looked at Tsubasa and said, &quot;Pictures of me? I 
never knew you felt that way, Brother.&quot;

Suddenly, Gattai Orochi started dissolving and the eight Orochi members 
fell to the ground. &quot;What happened?&quot; Girochi wondered.

&quot;Orochi is fueled by hatred,&quot; said Miyako. &quot;When Tsubasa and Souma were 
in total agreement, their other selves broke their combination.&quot;

&quot;But why?&quot; said Korona. &quot;They aren&#39;t Hydra and Akina. Gattai Orochi 
isn&#39;t Akidra! This is a Kannazuki no Miko fanfic, not UFO Ultramaiden 
Valkyrie! Stop confusing Kaishaku&#39;s works!&quot;
