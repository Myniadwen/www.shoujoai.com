<h1>Spiral of Destiny (part 9 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kannazuki/index.html">Kannazuki no Miko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nwarford.html">Nathan Warford</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kannazuki/kannanisou-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>For the first time in a long time, all of the Orochi members were 
enjoying themselves. Miyako had used Yastu no Onokoshizuchi to rip the 
roof off of a liquor store and had swiped several beers and mixers. 
Tsubasa, Miyako, and Rehko were enjoying several bottles of beer while 
Girochi, Korona, and Souma sipped on rum with mango juice. Nekoko had 
gone with Izuhara no Tamazuchi to steal candy for herself. 

&quot;The time has finally come,&quot; Tsubasa announced, &quot;for the Orochi to rule 
the world. With the Priestesses no longer able to revive Ame no 
Murakumo, there is nothing that can stop us this time.&quot; 

&quot;So that means we don&#39;t have to kill Kurusugawa, right?&quot; asked Souma. 

&quot;You&#39;d better not kill her,&quot; said Girochi. &quot;I can&#39;t go on a date with 
Hime if she&#39;s dead.&quot; 

&quot;When will you learn,&quot; Souma shot, &quot;that Himeko will never go out with 
you?&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;d you say?&quot; Girochi barked. 

&quot;If Kurusugawa is going to go out with anybody, it&#39;s going to be me.&quot; 

Souma and Girochi got into a heated argument while the other Orochi 
members reminisced about their past experiences. &quot;Finally,&quot; Tsubasa 
sighed, &quot;we can rest.&quot; 

&quot;We no longer need to live in constant fear of Ame no Murakumo,&quot; said 
Miyako. 

&quot;Nothing is going to stop us now,&quot; Korona grinned. 

&quot;And I can get to boom things again, nya!&quot; cried Nekoko excitedly. 

&quot;We have the world at our fingertips,&quot; Tsubasa said, raising his hand to 
the sky as if holding a globe in the palm of his hand. &quot;We shall destroy 
the world and then remake it as we see fit!&quot; 

&quot;I will no longer have to write this horrible manga that I&#39;m forced to 
work on,&quot; said Rehko. 

&quot;No more sleeping with the producers to get my big break,&quot; Korona 
sighed. 

&quot;No more animal testing,&quot; said Nekoko. 

&quot;Master Tsubasa,&quot; cooed Miyako, &quot;we&#39;ll follow you to the end.&quot; 

Tsubasa then said, &quot;There is one thing that I must do before the true 
celebration.&quot; He walked over to where Souma and Girochi were fighting 
and stepped in between the two. &quot;The Third Neck will not have possession 
of the Solar Priestess.&quot; Girochi looked at Tsubasa with disdain. 

The First Neck then turned to the Seventh Neck and said, &quot;Souma. You 
want the Solar Priestess for yourself, don&#39;t you?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, Brother,&quot; answered Souma. 

Tsubasa revealed his sword and presented it to his brother. &quot;Then go. 
Find her. She does not have to suffer the fate of the Lunar Priestess.&quot; 

Souma smiled and took Tsubasa&#39;s sword. The purple mark of the Orochi 
appeared on Souma&#39;s forehead and Take no Yamikazuchi appeared. Souma 
jumped into the Orochi body&#39;s circular portal and turned his attention 
toward the Earth. With Tsubasa&#39;s power infused into his sword, Take no 
Yamikazuchi sprouted Take no Yasukunazuchi&#39;s wings and flew off into the 
clouds below. 

---------- 

Despite the long journey, the first part was easy to traverse. Kazuki 
and Yukihito had long strides, so they could move very quickly without 
much effort. Because of their time at Ototachibana Academy and having to 
climb up the many stairs in front of the school building 5 days a week, 
Himeko and Chikane were very fit and were able to walk for long periods 
of time. And even though Chikane had been away for the past year, she 
had not existed in corporeal form for that time and her body had 
regenerated in just as much shape as it was before the world was remade. 

The plains nearby the Sea of Japan were easy on the group&#39;s feet and 
they easily made 10 kilometers a day. They tended to keep to the forests 
so that their Shinto uniforms would not attract attention. Himeko and 
Chikane would have much rather dressed casually, but Kazuki had informed 
them that the powers that the uniforms possessed would protect them from 
danger. As night started to fall, they set up a campfire and cooked some 
fish that Kazuki had bought the day before in preparation for the 
journey. 

&quot;You know,&quot; said Yukihito as they sat around the fire, &quot;I&#39;ve never 
realized how nice the forest is. It&#39;s very quiet and peaceful.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s how our ancestors lived during the ages of the gods,&quot; Kazuki said. 
&quot;Before Orochi was born.&quot; 

&quot;Mister Ogami,&quot; said Himeko, &quot;you told me and Chikane about the 
Priestesses last year and about our duties. But there&#39;s still a lot that 
we don&#39;t know. How was Orochi born in the first place? What could give 
rise to such evil?&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s a good question,&quot; said Kazuki. &quot;Unlike the other gods, Orochi 
had no ancestors. Orochi was born from the dark feelings of humans. 
Those feelings are what gave rise to Orochi.&quot; 

&quot;And they are also what sustains Orochi,&quot; Chikane added. &quot;The eight 
followers of Orochi have all experienced some deep pain in their lives. 
Tsubasa killed his father and gave up his brother, the church that 
Miyako and Girochi belonged to was destroyed, Souma saw his father 
killed and was turned down by the person he loved. And me...I felt so 
guilty for having killed the person that I loved. I did all I could to 
make you hate me. But the more I drove you away, the deeper my pain 
became. That&#39;s the reason that Orochi has followers. Their own dark 
feelings are what keep Orochi alive, and they are also what allows 
Orochi to consume their hearts.&quot; 

&quot;And the Orochi&#39;s evil only spreads,&quot; said Kazuki. &quot;The more destruction 
that Orochi causes, the more hardship and pain humans feel. More dark 
feelings to fuel Orochi.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s why the Priestesses exist,&quot; realized Himeko. &quot;Only their pure 
hearts can silence the evil of Orochi.&quot; 

&quot;Actually,&quot; said Yukihito, &quot;from what Mister Ogami has told me, it was 
only one Priestess that revived Ame no Murakumo last year.&quot; 

&quot;That was Himeko,&quot; Chikane said. &quot;I had allowed Orochi to consume me, 
and I left Himeko to revive Ame no Murakumo by herself. But it was her 
own kind-heartedness that warmed and purified my heart. The love that we 
had overwhelmed the Orochi inside me and we came so close to defeating 
Orochi.&quot; 

&quot;It must have been that same purity that allowed Souma to resist 
Orochi&#39;s evil,&quot; said Kazuki. &quot;I only wish that he had someone that could 
silence the Orochi within him this year.&quot; 

Himeko&#39;s head turned down, knowing that she was not with Souma to purify 
his Orochi blood. Chikane put her hand on Himeko&#39;s shoulder and the two 
girls looked at each other. Himeko could almost hear Chikane reminding 
her of what she had said the night before, &quot;You can&#39;t start blaming 
yourself for something that isn&#39;t in your control.&quot; 

&quot;There has to be some way to free Souma from Orochi&#39;s control,&quot; said 
Himeko. &quot;I&#39;m sure there is.&quot; 

&quot;He has the power to break free,&quot; Chikane noted. &quot;He proved that last 
year. All that he needs is something to draw out the good in him.&quot; 

&quot;But what about Orochi&#39;s curse?&quot; Himeko asked. &quot;If he goes against 
Orochi&#39;s orders, those dark scales will appear on his body again.&quot; 

&quot;That is true,&quot; Kazuki said solemnly. &quot;I wish that things could be 
different. However, we must seal away Orochi inside the Lunar Shrine if 
he is to leave the world in peace for the next several hundred years. 
And because his followers are what gives him strength...&quot; 

&quot;...then we have to seal away his followers as well,&quot; Chikane finished. 

&quot;No. It can&#39;t be,&quot; said Yukihito. 

&quot;It saddens me to say it,&quot; Kazuki said, the same solemnity in his voice, 
&quot;but we have no choice. If we are to save the world, we have no choice 
but to fight our friends. Even Souma, whom is, in every way that 
matters, my brother.&quot; 

Then, Himeko said, &quot;If there were some way to kill Orochi, then maybe 
Souma and all the Orochi members would be freed. If only Orochi could be 
destroyed.&quot; 

&quot;But the only way to make Orochi weak enough to destroy is if he&#39;s 
deprived of his sustenance,&quot; said Chikane. &quot;And the only way to do that 
is to get rid of the hate inside the hearts of his followers.&quot; 

&quot;It seems,&quot; said Kazuki, &quot;that the only way to free Orochi&#39;s followers 
is to kill Orochi, and the only way to kill Orochi is to free his 
followers.&quot; 

&quot;Like the chicken and the egg,&quot; Yukihito commented. 

&quot;Even if we seal Orochi away,&quot; said Kazuki, &quot;it seems impossible to 
prevent Orochi from returning some time in the future.&quot; 

&quot;Although...&quot; Chikane spoke up. Everyone looked at Chikane to hear what 
she had to say. &quot;Things that seemed impossible have still happened,&quot; the 
dark-haired girl continued. &quot;It seemed impossible for a priestess to 
become an Orochi follower like I did. It seemed impossible for an Orochi 
follower to go against Orochi like Souma did. I&#39;m sure that there&#39;s some 
way to end it all, some way to make sure that Orochi never returns. 
Whether it was the chicken that came first or the egg, one of them had 
to come first. If we know how it all started, maybe we can find a way to 
end it as well.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Himeko chirped. &quot;If we put our minds and our hearts into 
it, we can do anything. We can destroy Orochi, free his followers, 
overcome our fate, and live normal lives like we&#39;ve always wanted.&quot; 

&quot;That would make me so happy,&quot; Chikane said, looking lovingly at Himeko. 

&quot;Your confidence is admirable,&quot; Kazuki said, a smile appearing on his 
face. &quot;You&#39;re right. Seemingly impossible things have happened in the 
past. And with the determination and love that your girls have, you 
might just have the power to end it once and for all.&quot; 

&quot;I wonder how Souma is now,&quot; Yukihito spoke his mind. &quot;I hope he isn&#39;t 
suffering too much from Orochi&#39;s evil.&quot; 

---------- 

At the same time that the four travelers were setting up their sleeping 
bags and getting ready for sleep, the residents at the Himemiya estate 
were getting ready to turn in for the night as well. Takeshi and Rika 
were sitting next to each other on the bed in their large bedroom, but 
their restless minds would not allow them to sleep just yet. &quot;How do you 
think Chikane is doing?&quot; Rika asked. 

&quot;She is a strong girl,&quot; Takeshi said. &quot;She has always excelled in 
everything she&#39;s done. I am sure that she&#39;s doing just fine.&quot; 

&quot;And what about Miss Kurusugawa?&quot; 

&quot;She seems like a strong girl too, almost as strong as our daughter.&quot; 

&quot;But do you think that they&#39;re strong enough to complete their missions 
as priestesses?&quot; 

Takeshi smiled and took Rika&#39;s hands in his. &quot;I think you worry too 
much, Rika. As long as they take care of each other, both Chikane and 
Himeko will be just fine.&quot; 

As the couple was about to change into their bedclothes, a knock came at 
the door. &quot;Mister Himemiya,&quot; Otoha&#39;s voice came from behind the door, 
&quot;there&#39;s a guest here to see you.&quot; 

&quot;A guest at this hour?&quot; Takeshi said to himself. He turned to his wife 
and said, &quot;This won&#39;t take long.&quot; With that, Takeshi stood up and walked 
out of the room. 

Rika sat on the bed, looking at the door that Takeshi had exited through 
with a puzzled expression on her face. She wondered to herself, &quot;Why 
would Takeshi see a visitor at this time of night?&quot; 

Due to Mr. Himemiya&#39;s rule that no males were allowed inside the mansion 
besides him, Otoha had asked the visitor to wait for Mr. Himemiya in the 
courtyard. However, when Takeshi got outside, he found the courtyard 
empty. &quot;Who could that have been?&quot; he wondered, scratching his head. 

Takeshi was about to walk back into the house when suddenly, a giant 
hand fell on top of him. The finger&#39;s wrapped around Takeshi&#39;s body and 
picked up the helpless man. Takeshi struggled to break free, but the 
cold, hard steel of the hand kept him completely immobilized. As Takeshi 
looked up, he saw that the hand belonged to a giant, mechanical creature 
as tall as the mansion. It was colored blue and had glowing, green eyes. 
The creature brought its other hand next to Takeshi so that the 
black-haired boy standing on the hand could speak to him. &quot;Mister 
Himemiya,&quot; said the boy. &quot;You know where the girls are headed, don&#39;t 
you?&quot; 

&quot;What is it to you?&quot; asked Takeshi defiantly. 

&quot;Allow me to introduce myself,&quot; the boy said. &quot;I am--&quot; 

&quot;I know who you are, Souma Ogami,&quot; Takeshi said. 

The boy stared blankly at the middle-aged man. &quot;How did you know that?&quot; 

Then, an expression appeared on Takeshi&#39;s face that nobody would expect 
from a person in his position. Although trapped by a gigantic, robotic 
monster, Takeshi was smiling! His eyes turned from a soft brown to a 
menacing yellow and the hand that was holding him shattered. Instead of 
falling t the ground, Takeshi floated to the ground, landing safely on 
his feet. &quot;I can see your mind, Seventh Neck,&quot; the man said. &quot;You want 
to know where Himeko and Chikane are. You desire Himeko, and you want to 
kill Chikane. You can take Himeko for all I care. But if you so much as 
put a scratch on Chikane, you will suffer dearly for it.&quot; 

Souma stared at Mr. Himemiya, his eyes wide with a mixture of stun and 
terror. &#39;How did this man free himself from Take no Yamikazuchi&#39;s 
grasp?&#39; Souma thought. 

&quot;They went into the mountains,&quot; Takeshi said. &quot;There is another shrine 
there where the Priestesses can revive Ame no Murakumo. Unfortunately, I 
don&#39;t know where. So you&#39;d better hurry before they have a chance to 
revive the God of Swordsmen.&quot; 

&quot;Why should I believe you?&quot; Souma asked. 

&quot;Because if I&#39;m right, then the Priestesses will have another chance to 
revive the only one that can defeat Orochi. And you can&#39;t afford to take 
that risk, can you?&quot; 

&#39;What is he?&#39; Souma could not help but wonder. &#39;How does he know so much 
about Orochi? Kurusugawa and Himemiya couldn&#39;t have told him 
everything.&#39; 

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Takeshi said. &quot;They couldn&#39;t tell me everything in the 
short amount of time that they&#39;ve been staying at this mansion.&quot; 

Souma jumped at Mr. Himemiya&#39;s statement. &quot;Can you...&quot; he stammered, 
&quot;Can you...read my thoughts?&quot; 

&quot;I can sense the thoughts of every Orochi member. You&#39;d better hurry up. 
If you want to find the girls, you&#39;d better start searching now.&quot; 

Takeshi&#39;s yellow eyes looked straight into Souma&#39;s and the mark of 
Orochi appeared on Souma&#39;s forehead. Souma held his head and cried out 
in pain as Orochi&#39;s evil started overflowing from him. The outer shell 
of Take no Yamikazuchi started glowing, and then shattered, revealing 
the giant god&#39;s true form. Its coloration had turned from blue to red, 
the metal plate in front of its mouth retracted, and the creature bared 
its teeth. 

Wings sprouted from Take no Yamikazuchi&#39;s back and it went flying off 
toward the mountains. Takeshi smiled as he watched the giant god 
disappear into the darkness. &quot;Soon,&quot; the man said to himself, &quot;the 
Priestesses will be separated, Orochi will be revived, and I will be 
reborn.&quot; 

To be continued...

OMAKE: 

Himeko and Chikane would have much rather dressed casually on their 
journey, but Kazuki had informed them that the powers that the uniforms 
possessed would protect them from danger. Himeko tripped over her own 
feet every now and then. &quot;These sandals are impossible to walk in!&quot; she 
cried. &quot;Why do we have to wear sandals anyway?&quot; 

&quot;They are part of the uniforms of the two Priestesses,&quot; said Kazuki. 
&quot;You will need them to revive Ame no Murakumo.&quot; 

&quot;But we&#39;re not to the shrine yet. And besides, they&#39;re just sandals.&quot; 

&quot;They may be just sandals, but the uniform is not complete without 
them.&quot; 

&quot;For crying out loud, Kazuki! This isn&#39;t cosplay!&quot; 

Kazuki&#39;s eyes narrowed and he said, &quot;Keep walking, Kurusugawa. Or I will 
be forced to get feudal on your ass.&quot;
