<p>Himeko  sprinted through the woods, lungs on fire and legs aching with every  step. It felt just like when she had been fleeing from the Sixth  Neck, only that time she'd been running away from danger and now she  was running towards it.</p>
<p><em>They'd  been fleeing for a couple of minutes, weaving through the trees.   Professor Ohgami was leading the way, but she looked back over her  shoulder every few seconds to make sure that the girls were with her.   Himeko hated that she was abandoning Chikane to fight alone, but her  twin was right. She couldn't help, and the Orochi would certainly  try to use her against her beloved.</em></p>
<p><em>Minako  turned her head again, then stopped in her tracks and turned around.   Marika spun, too, wondering what her aunt was seeing, and a quizzical  expression crossed her face.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Huh?  What's--&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Himeko  was about to turn and see, too, when Professor Ohgami took a step  forward and in a motion so smooth as to be almost instantaneous,  reached out, caught Marika by the neck and shoulder, and snapped her  spine.</em></p>
<p><em>The  scream caught in Himeko's throat so all that emerged was a terrified  whimper.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Why...why  did you do that?&quot; she forced out through a voice that was  suddenly choking off with tears.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Because  I've always liked her, and I wanted her death to be clean and easy,  without suffering,&quot; Minako replied matter-of-factly.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;You...you're  Orochi!&quot; Himeko gasped, backing away on suddenly shaking legs. </em>Chikane!  I have to warn Chikane!</p>
<p><em>&quot;Yes.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>She  waved her hand and a glowing violet seal blazed up on the ground  beneath Himeko's feet. When she hit the edge she was stopped cold,  as if the glowing symbol was only the base of a cylinder.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Stay  there for a while,&quot; the professor told her. &quot;I have to go  see your sister, and I don't want you interfering.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Chikane!&quot;  Himeko screamed, finally finding her voice. &quot;Chikane!&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Feel  free to shout all you like; sound only travels one way through that  seal. I thought you might distract her, otherwise. Perhaps I'll  tell her hello for you?</em></p>
<p>Himeko  had beat on the seal with her fists, tried scraping away the markings  on the ground with her shoe but nothing worked. She'd been forced to  wait there, terrified of what the professor would do to Chikane,  until the seal finally vanished. She immediately set off at a dead  run to get to Chikane, hoping against hope that she'd find her twin  alive and well.</p>
<p>The  run took only a few minutes but seemed to last an eternity before she  came out of the woods. The shrine residence was just <em>gone</em>,  together with a large chunk of the forest behind it. The courtyard  looked like it had been shelled by artillery, and four figures could  be seen. Two men and a woman were sprawled, still and unmoving, but  the fourth...</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane!&quot;</p>
<p>Tears  were streaming down Himeko's face when she reached the other girl.</p>
<p>&quot;You're  all right! I was so scared, Chikane! Professor Ohgami is an Orochi!  She killed Marika, and I thought she--&quot; Belatedly, she realized  that Chikane's eyes were shadowed, her face as black and hopeless as  she'd ever seen in this life. &quot;Ch-Chikane?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  know, Himeko,&quot; she said softly, no, dully. &quot;Not just an  Orochi, but the Solar Priestess as well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The  Solar Priestess too? How?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;I  don't know, but she is. She had the mark, and the full power of  Yokusemi no Mizuchi besides. She destroyed three of the other  Necks--I'd already killed one--then held me down, helpless. I  couldn't do anything at all to fight her. Then she took my blood, so  that she could wholly unseal Orochi itself.&quot; She held out her  arm, where she'd bound the slash up with a strip off her T-shirt.   Red had seeped through; the wound probably would need stitches at the  very least if Chikane hadn't been Lunar Priestess.</p>
<p>&quot;Then  she's going to summon Yamata no Orochi?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;I  don't see how anything can stop her.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>Minako  landed lightly on the eighth <em>torii</em> as she arrived in the Orochi shrine. Anger and hatred hammered at  her in palpable waves, not directed <em>at</em> her precisely but at the totality of the world, at all existence.   There was a certain purity to it; Yamata no Orochi's malice was so  all-encompassing that it transcended boundaries. Even the despised  miko of Ame no Murakumo who had sealed it so many times were not held  worse than any other human; they were merely its enemies.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't  worry; I'm going to let you out to play in a minute,&quot; she said  up at the dark sun. &quot;But first things...well, First  things...first.&quot;</p>
<p>She  leapt from her gate across to the only one still occupied by a Neck.   At close range, the ruin of Reiko Himemiya actually made her flinch,  not so much from sympathy but from the realization that this was  precisely what Chikane had hoped to accomplish in that battle.</p>
<p>&quot;Scary  girl,&quot; she remarked. It kind of proved her point, though, when  the <em>good</em> side was represented by someone like <em>that.</em></p>
<p>Reiko  whimpered when Minako bent down and yanked the black sword from her  grasp. The solar mark glowed fiercely from the older woman's chest  and black fire ran up and down her arms as she summoned her power as  a priestess and an Orochi both.</p>
<p>Then  she snapped the Shadow of Take no Sukunazuchi over her knee. The  sword dissolved into nothingness, and Reiko squealed, more like a  wounded animal than a person. Minako grabbed her by the shirtfront,  holding her up at arm's length easily with the enhanced strength of a  fully empowered Neck.</p>
<p>&quot;If  it's any consolation to you, what I have in mind for Chikane will be  much worse than this.&quot;</p>
<p>She  opened her hand, and the girl plummeted through the clouds, echoed by  a dull thud a moment later. The surge of malice from Orochi's eye  above confirmed the death.</p>
<p>&quot;And  now no human wills remain to confuse or distract. The eight gods  will act as one, guided only by my intent.&quot;</p>
<p>She  returned to her own gate and faced the center of her shrine.</p>
<p>&quot;Yokusemi  no Mizuchi!&quot; she shouted. The demon appeared behind her gate,  throwing no shadow in the sunless temple of Orochi.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Beneath  darkness are gathered the eight ancient gods:&quot;</em> she intoned.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Take  no Sukunazuchi!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Behind  the First Neck's gate, a towering shape began to manifest, shadowed  armor with rotting black wings, a straight sword in the ancient  Chinese style held point-downward in its gauntlets. It was  translucent, even wavering--a mere Shadow of itself without the  tangible force of Minako's own god, but it was there, manifested at  her command.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Yatsu  no Onokoshizuchi!&quot;</em></p>
<p>A  tentacled horror like a massive worm with a forest of eye-tipped and  claw-tipped tentacles seething and twisting around its hideous maw.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Hi  no Ashinazuchi!&quot;</em></p>
<p>A  hulking, hunchbacked giant whose quadruple-sized right arm was only  its most obvious deformity.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Ooube  no Senazuchi!&quot;</em></p>
<p>A  centipede-like creature with an antlion's mandibles wreathed in  hungry flames.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Ho  no Shuraizuchi!&quot;</em></p>
<p>A  titanic humanlike head, only with two faces, one wreathed in hatred  and one in despair, slowly rotating to show both sides. Stark  madness stared out of all four eyes.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Izuhara  no Tamazuchi!&quot;</em></p>
<p>A  great black panther, the length of its body studded by  irregular-shaped eyes and leering, fanged maws.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Take  no Yamikazuchi!&quot;</em></p>
<p>A  second armored figure, this one like a samurai with a full-face mask  of a fanged devil, but bearing no weapon in its gauntleted hands.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Yokusemi  no Mizuchi!&quot;</em></p>
<p>The  hawk-demon screamed its hatred and defiance to the heavens.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Now  is the time for all to become one!&quot;</em></p>
<p>She  unsheathed the Solar Blade and extended it before her.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Orochi  is darkness!&quot;</em></p>
<p>The  dried blood that smeared its tip began to shimmer.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Orochi  is the snake that twists in the core of the world!&quot;</em></p>
<p>As  if absorbing moisture from somewhere, it started to glisten.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Orochi  is mankind's malice!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Liquid  again, the droplets began to trail down the steel.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Orochi  is the darkness born from between the stars!&quot;</em></p>
<p>The  first drop separated from the blade, but instead of falling it flew <em>upward</em>,  rising towards the hungry eye above.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Orochi  is the name of the gods!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Eight  inhuman, monstrous voiced roared a crescendo as the blood-drops rose.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Yamata  no Orochi is the will that binds those gods together!&quot;</em></p>
<p>A  ringing chime seemed to echo through Orochi's shrine, like the  tolling of a funeral bell.</p>
<p>And  the dark eye began to grow and swell.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>Throughout  the town of Mahoroba, the earth shook. Seven seals were torn asunder  as the will of Yamata no Orochi called to its imprisoned body.   Titanic pillars of violet-streaked darkness reared into the sky;  those who looked at them shuddered and turned their heads away. The  darklights seemed to radiate shadow, not as the mere absence of light  but as an inherent, positive quality that could stand by itself.</p>
<p>The  pillars extended into the sky, joined by an eighth that seemed to  conjure from thin air. They converged, as if drawing together as  they reached for a single point in the sky, soaring towards the pale  silver of a daylight moon.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>The  seal was broken.</p>
<p>Staring  up at the eye of Orochi, Minako could see that the dark sun wasn't a  &quot;sun&quot; or &quot;eye&quot; at all, but a window. With the  seal that was its &quot;glass&quot; broken, the unfettered power of  the god poured forth in a seething cloud of blackness. The eight  gods--all now fully incarnate--stared up at it, trembling with  restrained eagerness to fulfill their sole purpose.</p>
<p>Then  Minako screamed as the will of Orochi filled her. The pain was  excruciating; power no human was meant to command tore at her soul.   But where the Orochi's force was chaotic and unfocused, its Eighth  Neck's will remained pure and controlled. The light blazed forth  from her chest, enhancing, focusing the chaos of Orochi into a single  path.</p>
<p><em>Her</em> path.</p>
<p>Perhaps  none but one of Ame no Murakumo's miko could have carried this  burden, mastering the will of the totality of Orochi as the Necks did  with their individual gods. Even then, &quot;mastery&quot; was a  hypothetical concept at best.</p>
<p>But  then again, the only command Minako wanted to give was the one the  god wanted to carry out anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;Go!&quot;  she roared into the darkness. &quot;Go and tear this miserable world  to pieces!&quot;</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>It  was as if all nature had turned on itself at once. Volcanoes  erupted, spewing pillars of magma and ash high into the atmosphere.   The seas rose, thousand-foot tsunami cresting over coastal cities.   In the hearts of the deserts, winds rose, sirocco that raged with  such intensity that stone and metal were scoured away to nothing.   Fire engulfed forests and jungles; ice storms of impossible intensity  blasted the polar regions, instantly sheathing entire cities in  foot-thick layers of frost.</p>
<p>And  everywhere, everywhere, people died.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>In  Mahoroba, the shaking had never stopped. Buildings fell; fissures  opened in the ground. Ruptured gas lines supplied fuel for sparks  and whatever wasn't being hurled down seemed to be set alight. The  screams of the dying rose from the valley.</p>
<p>In  the shattered courtyard of the Ohgami Shrine, Himako clung to  Chikane, tears streaming down her face.</p>
<p>&quot;Mother...Father...everyone!&quot;  she whimpered. &quot;Chikane, isn't there anything we can do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She's  really done it,&quot; Chikane said, cradling her beloved close but  not looking at her, instead looking up into the sky, at the seething  blot of darkness on the face of the moon so immense that she could  see it from earth. &quot;She's summoned Yamata no Orochi and  unleashed it upon the world. Only Ame no Murakumo can stop what is  to come, and without both priestesses we can't summon the god.   Professor Ohgami isn't a virgin, so she'd have to shed my blood to  break the seal, and I can't see her...cooperating...&quot;</p>
<p>Her  voice trailed off, causing Himeko to lift her face away from her  twin's chest to look at her.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane?&quot;</p>
<p>Then  Chikane laughed. It was not a nice laugh. It was a cruel laugh, the  merriment of a person taking pleasure in the misery of an enemy. Yet  to Himeko it was as sweet as the music Chikane could coax from the  piano. Her eyes widened, and she could feel her smile grow as hope  filled her, driving out grief and fear.</p>
<p>&quot;She  doesn't <em>need</em> to cooperate. She already <em>has</em>!&quot;  She let go of Himeko and touched her bandage. &quot;Isn't this the  blood of a pure priestess as shed by the other?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then...you  can...?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;No, <em>we</em> can.   You and I. It takes two people, after all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  I don't have--&quot; Himeko began, but stopped suddenly, her face  lighting up as memory struck her. &quot;Oh! Souma!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly!  Last time he filled in for me. This time, you can fill in  for...well, yourself.&quot; Chikane was <em>not</em> going to give that lying traitor the honor of acknowledging her as  the rightful Solar Priestess. &quot;Let's go.&quot;</p>
<p>They  ran as fast as they could from the courtyard to the hidden shrine.   The ground continued to tremble beneath their feet as they traveled,  and more than once Himeko lost her balance, having to be caught by  Chikane to keep from falling.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  sorry,&quot; she said when she stumbled a third time. &quot;I'm such  a klutz; I can't seem to keep my feet under me while the ground's  shaking like this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't  worry,&quot; Chikane told her while helping her up. &quot;I'm sure  you'll get your 'sea legs' in a minute.&quot;</p>
<p>Truthfully,  Chikane was more worried about how the <em>cave</em> would react to the quaking earth. How much stress could it take? If  the holy place was buried, could Ame no Murakumo even be called?</p>
<p>Her  fears were not borne out, though. The cave entrance was right where  it should have been, open and unblocked. When they took their first  steps inside, they were surprised by why.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!  The ground is stable in here!&quot; Himeko exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;You're  right. I wonder why? When we performed the ritual of unsealing, the  boundaries were destroyed, so this shouldn't be an enclosed space.   And even so, the earthquakes are because of the power of Orochi, so  they should be able to break down barriers in ways that natural  events couldn't.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe  it's because they're caused by Orochi?&quot; Himeko tentatively  suggested.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  called on her power to illuminate the dark passage, a soft moonglow  washing through it.</p>
<p>&quot;Well...the  quakes are like Orochi's attack on the earth itself, and the shrine  is the one point in the world closest to Ame no Murakumo, right?&quot;  the blonde tried to explain. She wasn't sure if she was saying it  right, but Chikane understood her right away.</p>
<p>&quot;So  perhaps it's more resistant to Orochi's power than other places?&quot;  She placed the flat of her hand against the passage wall, feeling the  faintest of vibrations coming through the rock, and set the thought  aside. Ultimately it didn't matter, not unless the cave came down on  their heads.</p>
<p>Quickly  they came to the shore of the underground lake and picked their way  through the broken gates until they came to the end of the stone pier  beneath the great rock. Chikane took a deep breath, then gripped  Himeko's hands with her own.</p>
<p>&quot;Are  you ready?&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Um-hm!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,  then.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  unwound the bandage from her arm, then drew the Lunar Blade and  extended the hilt towards Himeko. Her twin took the blade, her left  hand and Chikane's right holding the hilt, combining to form a  two-handed swordsman's grip.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Ame  no Murakumo no Tsurugi:&quot;</em></p>
<p>Himeko's  voice joined with hers as easily as it had before. Solar Priestess  or not, her soul knew the words.</p>
<p><em>&quot;With  the Mutsu Sword, we begin the ritual to cease the god.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Chikane  extended the slip of bloodstained fabric.</p>
<p><em>&quot;In  my hand, the Moon bleeds that which...&quot;</em></p>
<p>She  let it fall, slipping away into the water.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Your  sword, the Sun has shed.&quot;</em></p>
<p>She  could feel it! The power was gathering, it was <em>working</em>.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Descend,  God of Swordsmen, Ame no Murakumo!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Here  was perhaps the hardest part. Chikane had to <em>pray</em> for the god's revival, not just perform the ritual but actually crave  it, wish for it in her heart of hearts. If there was anything she  wasn't good at, it was submitting to the will of another. She  glanced at Himeko, who smiled hopefully at her, and Chikane realized  how stupid her last thought had been.</p>
<p><em>Please,  let me make her smile shine forever.</em></p>
<p>Golden  lightning crackled up and down the split face of the great stone.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>On  the moon, a shrine lay in ruins. It had been shattered, torn apart  from within by a tremendous force. Here the will of Yamata no Orochi  had lain sealed, and in its release only destruction lay in its wake.   Yet more slept here than just darkness. So too did its eternal  guardian reside, awaiting the call that rose to it from the dying  planet like a spark of light. Since it had felt the first stirrings  of the sealed god it had awaited that call, and when at last the  prayer reached it the response was immediate. A pillar of light as  brilliantly glowing as those of Orochi had been dark arose from the  shrine and descended across the gulf of space in an instant like a  great silver sword slashing the heavens.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>The  world exploded in silver light around Himeko. The mountain itself  seemed to vanish; the cavern was thrown open to the sky by the  descending power of the god. The brilliance seemed to surround her,  infusing every part of her being. It sang through her body,  restoring her inside and out. The presence was almost unbearable, as  if the light filled her up to near-bursting, but it was also somehow  sweet, and familiar. As Solar Priestess she'd borne this burden  easily; as a normal girl it was hard, even terrible, but she  managed--<em>more</em> than managed--to cope.</p>
<p>When  her sight cleared she found herself next to Chikane, within a sphere  of brilliant silver radiance. Chikane seemed fully healed; there was  no sign of her injuries from the battle and her jeans and T-shirt had  vanished, replaced by her priestess garb. It, too, showed no sign of  damage; her vestments were neither torn nor stained. Himeko's  clothes had changed, too, replaced by robes identical to the  priestesses' but snowy white, without color.</p>
<p>&quot;It  worked!&quot; She clapped her hands giddily. &quot;Now we can save  everyone, Chikane!&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  smiled sweetly at her.</p>
<p>&quot;You'll  never change, will you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um,  did I say something wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,  Himeko, you said something very right.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh...okay.&quot;   She wasn't quite sure that she understood, but if Chikane was happy,  then she wasn't going to worry about it.</p>
<p>Chikane  extended a hand to her, and Himeko took it, lacing their fingers  together.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's  go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mmn!&quot;</p>
<p>They  streaked upwards, suspended within the sphere of light. The power of  Ame no Murakumo carried them high above the shattered mountain,  higher and higher until the air was so thin they would never have  been able to breathe without the god's aid. The barrier surrounding  them sustained their existence, preventing mere environmental  concerns from touching them.</p>
<p>&quot;Look,&quot;  Chikane said. &quot;It's already the beginning of the end.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  followed the direction of her sister's gaze, seeing the curve of the  earth stretch out before them. It was tearing itself apart, as if  the planet's core was expanding, swelling obscenely within its shell  so that the plates of its crust were separated on the suddenly larger  mantle. Great walls of flame spewed thousands of feet upwards along  the edges, forming a hellish web across the earth's surface.</p>
<p>&quot;We  have to beat Orochi and Professor Ohgami,&quot; she urged. &quot;It's  the only way.&quot;</p>
<p><em>It's  so strange</em>,  Himeko thought<em>.   This is just like my past life. The planet in ruins and I'm flying  to confront the one responsible, but I feel so different</em>.   Then she hadn't been going to fight, but to find Chikane, to learn  why she'd done such things to the world and, yes, to her. Now,  Chikane was at her side, and it really felt like there would be a  battle. She hoped she'd be able to do her part; so far it had been  Chikane who'd had to bear the weight of all the fighting, and Himeko  didn't want her to have to do it all alone.</p>
<p>&quot;There's  only one place she can be,&quot; Chikane decided.</p>
<p>&quot;The  Lunar Shrine?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes...there!  I can feel her presence. The power of Ame no Murakumo can always  seek out his priestesses.&quot; She turned to Himeko and smiled.   &quot;Are you ready?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh-huh!&quot;</p>
<p>In  an instant they were hurled across the gulf of space, flying from  Earth to the moon in seconds. Below them they could see the ruined  shrine, its walls sundered, the stairway hurled down by the escape of  the unsealed demon. They could see her there, the lone figure of the  Solar Priestess, and they arrowed towards her. Minako looked up, but  she showed no sign of surprise. Instead, a smug little smile played  around her lips.</p>
<p>Then  eight mouths opened. Eight voices shook the heavens with their fury  and hate, malice and despair, and the great bulk of Yamata no Orochi  reared up to engulf them.</p>
<p align="center">-  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p>
<p><em>A/N:  Manga Himeko's most telling characteristic, apart from her love for  Chikane, has to be her strength of will. She isn't particularly  smart, she's not perceptive at all (witness her repeatedly thinking  Chikane was in love with Souma...), she's physically weak, she's  easily scared...and she recovers from extreme trauma in a matter of</em> panels<em>.   She shrugs off being raped without even the short-term shock that  anime Himeko goes through, she sees the world destroyed (including  the death of Makoto and Kazuki) but immediately refocuses on finding  Chikane, and she sees </em>Chikane  kill Souma right in front of her<em> and in less than two full pages she's saving Chikane's life (better  yet, within four pages she's asking Chikane &quot;Why did you have to  do that?&quot;--Chikane thinks she's talking about killing Souma, but  Himeko's already brushed that off--see pp. 185-190).</em></p>
<p><em>I  mention this just in case anyone's wondering about how easily Himeko  deals with Marika being killed in this chapter.</em></p>
<p><em>Basically,  while Himeko can be startled or horrified by the </em>initial<em> shock of an act of violence or tragedy, she's capable of accepting it  immediately and moving on without dwelling upon it. She is much, </em>much<em> tougher, mentally speaking, than Chikane is. I suppose it's an open  question whether it was this quality of hers that made Ame no  Murakumo select her as a priestess, or whether she's gone slightly  around the bend from too many centuries in solitary confinement  within the Lunar Shrine. I'm a romantic, so I tend to pick the  former.</em></p>
<p><em>Minako's  incantation is adapted from two of Chikane's monologues to Orochi in  Vol. 2 of the manga, while Chikane's is </em>very<em> loosely adapted from Himeko's summoning in Episode 11 of the anime.</em></p>
<p><em>As  for Ame no Murakumo's power being expressed by </em>silver<em> radiance rather than gold, that came from the fact that in the anime,  when Himeko and Souma are flying the AnM mech, it's colored silver  and blue. It only turns golden later on after the confession scene  in Episode 12. The manga's black-and-white pages don't permit us to  see the particular color scheme, but it's clear that when Himeko  calls back the god to catch the falling Chikane it similarly has a  new, glittering paint job. So with this evidence, I've decided that  silver is the color of the god's power, as bestowed on its human  vessels, while gold represents the actual will of the god, acting  directly in the world. You could just as easily argue that the gold  color is specifically that of the Solar Priestess while blue  represents the Lunar Priestess (see ep. 12), but that's getting too  confusing for the manga. ;)</em></p>
