----------

The Sword God and the two celestial gods faced off. All of their 
injuries from their last battle had healed and they were ready for 
combat again. &quot;I see you&#39;ve recovered from your injuries, Ame no 
Murakumo,&quot; Chikane&#39;s voice came from Tsukuyomi no Mikoto.

&quot;You almost defeated me last time, Priestesses,&quot; said Ame no Murakumo, 
&quot;but I assure you that I will be victorious in this fight.&quot;

&quot;You seem awfully confident for someone that was so exhausted after one 
battle that she could barely stand,&quot; Himeko&#39;s voice came from Amaterasu 
Oomikami. &quot;Chikane and I came out of it with no more than a few 
scratches.&quot;

&quot;My powers have doubled since our last meeting,&quot; Ame no Murakumo said, 
the blades on her wrists slowly extending.

&quot;That&#39;s hard to believe after only three days,&quot; said Himeko, drawing the 
Solar Priestess Blade.

&quot;You&#39;re bluffing,&quot; Chikane said, drawing the Lunar Priestess Blade.

Amaterasu Oomikami and Tsukuyomi no Mikoto extended the blades on their 
wrists as well, Himeko and Chikane saying in unison, &quot;We dare you to 
demonstrate!&quot;

&quot;So be it.&quot; Ame no Murakumo rushed at Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi, and the 
celestial gods rushed at Ame no Murakumo as well. Blades clashed as the 
three mechs began round two.

The last several days of concentrating on nothing else but their bond 
had definitely increased Himeko&#39;s and Chikane&#39;s powers. They were 
actually able to get several strikes off on Ame no Murakumo. However, it 
soon became apparent that Ame no Murakumo had grown stronger as well as 
the Priestesses also received minor cuts during the battle.

&quot;She&#39;s definitely gotten faster,&quot; Himeko said.

&quot;The faster the fight, the faster the fall,&quot; said Chikane. &quot;If we wear 
her down enough, she won&#39;t be able to fight.&quot;

Himeko nodded at Chikane&#39;s statement. As the gods fought, the blade on 
Amaterasu&#39;s left wrist started glowing violet and the blade on 
Tsukuyomi&#39;s right wrist started glowing blue. The blades still colliding 
frequently, Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi fired brief but potent bolts of 
light from the tips of their blades. Because Ame no Murakumo used her 
blades to block the celestial gods&#39; blades, she could not use them to 
block the bolts, and she was hit several times in her chest and abdomen.

Ame no Murakumo growled as small dents formed on her front side. 
However, Himeko and Chikane could tell from the sound of her voice that 
the growl was more out of anger than out of physical pain. The bolts 
that they were firing at her were obviously more aggravating than 
damaging, much like the feeling of a mosquito buzzing around one&#39;s ear. 
Ame no Murakumo&#39;s irritation seemed to reach a peak and she yelled in 
anger. Ame no Murakumo jumped up and extended her legs, kicking at 
Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi. Himeko and Chikane jumped back from Ame no 
Murakumo&#39;s kick. Himeko felt a stinging sensation in her right side and 
Chikane left a stinging in her left. Ame no Murakumo had managed to cut 
them with the blades on her feet.

The blades on Amaterasu Oomikami&#39;s and Tsukuyomi no Mikoto&#39;s wrists 
opened up into bows and the celestial gods began firing arrows at Ame no 
Murakumo. The blades on Ame no Murakumo&#39;s wrists started spinning 
around, blocking the force of the explosions. Out of the hot gas and 
smoke produced from the explosions, Tsukuyomi no Mikoto flew at Ame no 
Murakumo, bringing its blade under the whirlwind of Ame no Murakumo&#39;s 
spinning blades and then upwards, leaving a cut in the Sword God&#39;s 
belly. Ame no Murakumo groaned in pain and spun around, hitting 
Tsukuyomi no Mikoto in the right side with her knee. Chikane felt the 
wind knocked out of her as she was knocked to the ground by the impact.

Himeko continued her barrage of arrows, hitting Ame no Murakumo several 
times in the back, throwing her away several hundred meters. &quot;Chikane,&quot; 
Himeko said, running to her girlfriend&#39;s side.

Chikane staggered to her feet, coughing several times. &quot;What she said 
was true,&quot; said Chikane. &quot;Her powers have increased since our last 
battle.&quot; Chikane then clasped Himeko&#39;s left hand with her right and 
said, &quot;But we won&#39;t let that stop us!&quot;

Himeko and Chikane called out in unison, &quot;Divine Light of the Eclipse!&quot; 
The fused arm of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi fired its white light at Ame no 
Murakumo, who fired a beam of yellow light from its wings. The two beams 
collided, creating a gigantic explosion, which blew the celestial gods 
and Ame no Murakumo nearly two kilometers away from each other. Each 
mech landing on its feet, they rushed straight back at each other, Ame 
no Murakumo clashing again with Amaterasu Oomikami and Tsukuyomi no 
Mikoto in a matter of seconds.

Himeko grasped Chikane&#39;s left shoulder and Chikane grasped Himeko&#39;s 
right shoulder. &quot;Celestial Spiral!&quot; They both called out. Amaterasu and 
Tsukuyomi jumped at Ame no Murakumo, spinning around one another, a 
cyclone of blades flying at her from every which way.

&quot;Not again!&quot; Ame no Murakumo proclaimed. A powerful blast of yellow 
light came from the spike on Ame no Murakumo&#39;s head, throwing Amaterasu 
and Tsukuyomi into the air, splitting them into their separate entities. 
The God of Swords then raised her arms into the air, hoping to impale 
Amaterasu Oomikami with her right blade and Tsukuyomi no Mikoto with her 
left blade. The celestial gods swung at Ame no Murakumo, their blades 
colliding with hers. They pushed themselves away, landing side-by-side 
in front of the Sword God.

Himeko felt a burning sensation in her right hand and Chikane in her 
left. They looked at their hands to find that they had been burned by 
Ame no Murakumo&#39;s attack. A burn in the shape of the Solar Mark had 
appeared on Himeko&#39;s right hand and a burn in the shape of the Lunar 
Mark had appeared on Chikane&#39;s left hand. &quot;Damn, that hurts!&quot; Chikane 
exclaimed.

&quot;It&#39;s like what happened when I tried to pick up the Solar Priestess 
Blade last year,&quot; Himeko said.

&quot;You have gone against the God of Swordsmen,&quot; said Ame no Murakumo. 
&quot;That is your punishment for not performing your rituals as you should!&quot; 
Ame no Murakumo fired a purple beam from her mouth at the celestial 
gods, the beam wrapping around them and forming a net, immobilizing 
them. &quot;You won&#39;t be able to fall over to avoid my attack this time!&quot; 
exclaimed Ame no Murakumo. The red jewels on the ends of the spikes on 
her back started glowing and she fired another beam of yellow light at 
the Priestesses from the spike on her head.

Himeko and Chikane stared at the beam coming at them, their eyes wide 
with fear. They held each other close and closed their eyes, ready to 
endure the final blow. However, as they held each other, the Solar Mark 
on Himeko&#39;s chest and the Lunar Mark on Chikane&#39;s back lit up brightly. 
A white light exploded from Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi, blowing the 
glowing, purple net off of their bodies. The bows on their wrists 
started spinning, creating a mighty wind that held back the blast, 
deflecting the beam around their bodies.

&quot;Ha!&quot; said Himeko. &quot;We weren&#39;t hurt by that attack of yours at all.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the power that our love has,&quot; Chikane continued. &quot;It&#39;s the power 
that will bring us victory!&quot;

&quot;Is that so?&quot; Ame no Murakumo asked. The rockets on her back fired, 
propelling her toward the Priestesses. Amaterasu Oomikami&#39;s and 
Tsukuyomi no Mikoto&#39;s bows closed back up into blades and the gods 
continued sword fighting. Ame no Murakumo continued, &quot;Your love will not 
bring you victory, only pain!&quot;

Ame no Murakumo elbowed Amaterasu Oomikami in the chest, throwing Himeko 
to the ground. The wind was knocked from Himeko so quickly that she did 
not even have enough air in her lungs to cry out in pain. &quot;Himeko!&quot; 
Chikane cried at seeing her beloved in pain. With Chikane momentarily 
distracted, Ame no Murakumo rushed at Tsukuyomi no Mikoto, lashing at it 
with the blade on her left wrist.

At the last minute, Chikane noticed Ame no Murakumo coming at her and 
blocked the blade with Tsukuyomi no Mikoto&#39;s. Ame no Murakumo pushed 
Tsukuyomi no Mikoto&#39;s blade out of the way with her left blade and swung 
at Tsukuyomi with her right. With Tsukuyomi&#39;s blade out of the way, 
there was nothing preventing Ame no Murakumo&#39;s right blade to slice 
through the Moon God&#39;s left arm, severing it from the shoulder.

A deafening scream of agony split the air as Chikane experienced pain 
unlike any she had ever felt before. She fell to her knees and clutched 
her left shoulder where her arm had been severed. In that moment, the 
entire world disappeared and all that Chikane could feel was the 
throbbing, searing pain that was shooting through her body from the 
small, stubby remainder of her once-slender limb.

----------

It did not take long for Himeko to regain her breath and see with her 
own eyes just how serious Chikane&#39;s injury was. The blonde stared in 
shock, horrified by the sight of her beloved curled up on the ground, 
her left arm completely gone, an expression of the most agonizing 
torture on her face. &quot;Do you see what your love brought you, Lunar 
Priestess?&quot; Ame no Murakumo scoffed. &quot;Your love for the Solar Priestess 
distracted you from the job at hand. And now you are experiencing the 
most intense pain a human can feel because of it.&quot;

In a daze, Himeko walked slowly and unsteadily toward Chikane. &quot;Chikane&quot; 
she said, a glazed look in her eyes. She felt as if she was dreaming, as 
if the sight of her beloved Chikane being dismembered were nothing more 
than an illusion. It was only when she fell to her knees beside Chikane 
and touched her girlfriend&#39;s body that reality began to set in. The 
glazed look in her eyes slowly lifted and she was overcome by a terrible 
mix of surprise, shock, sorrow, and horror. &quot;CHIKANE!!!&quot; she cried as 
she fully comprehended severity of the situation.

&quot;It is no use to keep fighting, Priestesses,&quot; Ame no Murakumo continued 
her heartless derogation. &quot;You, Lunar Priestess, will be unable to fight 
through the pain. And you, Solar Priestess, will undoubtedly perish 
without the Lunar Priestess fighting alongside you.&quot;

&quot;Himeko&quot; Chikane managed to choke out.

&quot;Chikane,&quot; Himeko sobbed. Through her tears, Himeko&#39;s expression took on 
an element of hatred. She stood up and clutched the Solar Priestess 
Blade tightly. &quot;Now you&#39;ve done it,&quot; she said. &quot;You&#39;ve hurt Chikane. I 
won&#39;t let you get away with this abomination.&quot; Himeko&#39;s voice slowly 
rose in volume and vehemence. &quot;I cannot tolerate someone that would hurt 
my beloved Chikane this way!&quot; Himeko turned toward Ame no Murakumo and 
looked straight through her, the Solar Mark glowing brightly on her 
chest, her violet eyes burning with anger and determination. &quot;Ame no 
Murakumo,&quot; she cried, &quot;YOU WILL PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID TO CHIKANE!!!&quot;

Amaterasu Oomikami&#39;s violet eyes lit up with the same fire that was in 
Himeko&#39;s and the God of the Sun charged at Ame no Murakumo. Ame no 
Murakumo took a stance, ready to counter Himeko&#39;s attack. However, 
Himeko&#39;s anger had multiplied her strength, making her other self 
stronger and faster than before. Amaterasu&#39;s blade moved at incredible 
speed, swinging at Ame no Murakumo ten times a second. Himeko 
continuously switched between her sword and her bow and arrows, not 
giving Ame no Murakumo enough time to anticipate Amaterasu&#39;s next 
attack.

&#39;This power&#39; Ame no Murakumo thought. &#39;How can a mere human have this 
kind of strength?&#39;

&quot;Himeko&quot; Chikane murmured at watching the short girl fighting her heart 
out in front of her. The sight was so amazing that Chikane almost forgot 
the pain from her severed arm.

Himeko cried out as she summoned all of the strength that she could 
muster. She lunged at Ame no Murakumo, knocking the Sword God onto her 
back. Amaterasu Oomikami straddled Ame no Murakumo, swinging its blade 
at her over and over and over again. Himeko was relentless in her 
attacks, giving Ame no Murakumo barely enough time to block her strikes.

Then, Ame no Murakumo fired the rockets on her back, propelling herself 
and Amaterasu Oomikami off the ground. The force pushed Amaterasu 
Oomikami off of Ame no Murakumo, knocking the Sun God down. Ame no 
Murakumo raised her blades and swung at Amaterasu.

A purple blur flew in front of Himeko and blocked Ame no Murakumo&#39;s 
attack. Himeko looked up and was surprised to find that the one that had 
protected her was Chikane! She was standing over Himeko, holding off Ame 
no Murakumo with only her right arm, clutching the Lunar Priestess Blade 
with all her might. &quot;Lunar Priestess,&quot; said Ame no Murakumo. &quot;You still 
have some fight left.&quot;

&quot;Himeko risked her life for my sake,&quot; said Chikane. &quot;And now I shall 
return the favor!&quot;

&quot;What can you hope to accomplish in your condition?&quot; Ame no Murakumo 
pressed more of her weight against Tsukuyomi no Mikoto and Chikane 
pressed back with equal force.

Himeko looked at Chikane&#39;s wound and saw blood gushing from it as she 
struggled to push Ame no Murakumo away. &quot;Chikane, stop,&quot; Himeko said. 
&quot;The more you fight, the more blood you&#39;ll lose. At this rate&quot;

&quot;I am not going to stand by and watch while you&#39;re killed on my 
account,&quot; Chikane said. She turned back to the God of Swordsmen and 
said, &quot;You were wrong about one thing, Ame no Murakumo. The physical 
pain that you&#39;ve inflicted on me is not even close to the most intense 
pain a human can feel. It would be infinitely worse to separate me from 
Himeko again. Even through the pain that I feel right now, as long as I 
can keep her by my side&quot; Chikane summoned up the rest of her strength 
and exclaimed, &quot;I will!&quot; Chikane pushed Ame no Murakumo off of her body 
with the strength of her single arm and attacked Ame no Murakumo with 
blinding speed. There was a bright, blue light and the sound of metal 
slicing through metal was heard.

Ame no Murakumo roared in pain and staggered backward, glowing, white 
blood dripping from her left shoulder, from which her arm had 
disappeared. With Ame no Murakumo presently dazed, Chikane looked at the 
girl sitting below her and asked, &quot;Himeko, are you all right?&quot;

&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Himeko nodded.

Still holding the Lunar Priestess Blade in her right hand, Chikane held 
out her other hand to help Himeko up. Himeko grabbed Chikane&#39;s hand and 
Chikane helped her to her feet. It was only then that Himeko realized 
that something didn&#39;t add up. &quot;Chikane,&quot; she said, &quot;your arm&quot;

Chikane then realized that she had helped Himeko to her feet with her 
left arm. She looked to find that her arm had been completely restored! 
She moved her fingers to find that she still had perfect motor control 
of the limb. Tsukuyomi no Mikoto had a completely new left arm, a 
silvery white color with a large blade attached to its wrist. Tsukuyomi 
had taken Ame no Murakumo&#39;s arm and was now using it as its own, and 
Chikane&#39;s arm had been rebuilt in the process!

&quot;You&#39;ve lost, Ame no Murakumo!&quot; exclaimed Himeko. &quot;Accept it!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve stolen your arm and the blade that was attached to it!&quot; said 
Chikane. Tsukuyomi no Mikoto extended the blade that was on its new left 
wrist and crossed its blades in front of it, striking a pose. &quot;It 
doesn&#39;t matter how many limbs you sever from my body; I&#39;ll just repair 
them with your limbs! There&#39;s no way that you can win now!&quot;

Then, Ame no Murakumo started laughing hysterically. &quot;You think you have 
it all worked out, don&#39;t you, Priestesses? But there is still one thing 
that you have failed to take into account.&quot; Ame no Murakumo&#39;s eyes 
started changing from their original shade of green to a deep red color.

The Solar and Lunar Marks lit up as Chikane and Himeko both sensed the 
presence of a powerful evil spirit. On the surface of the moon, the 
Lunar Shrine started glowing purple. As the glow increased in intensity, 
the Shrine shattered and the dark, swirling aura of Orochi escaped. As 
the dark aura descended toward Earth, Orochi&#39;s United Body, Gattai 
Orochi, materialized around it. &quot;Oh no,&quot; said Chikane. &quot;Ame no Murakumo 
was one of the followers of Orochi. That means that if she isn&#39;t locked 
away, then Orochi would still gain strength from her and manage to free 
himself from the Lunar Shrine.&quot;

Then, much to Himeko and Chikane&#39;s surprise, Ame no Murakumo transformed 
back into its sword shape. &quot;What&#39;s happening now?&quot; Himeko wondered. 
Gattai Orochi reached with its tail for the hilt of the sword that was 
Ame no Murakumo. When the two pincers at the end of Orochi&#39;s tail 
clamped down on the hilt, Ame no Murakumo&#39;s body was drawn into the tail 
and became the tip of the tail!

Then, Gattai Orochi&#39;s yellow eyes turned the same shade of red as Ame no 
Murakumo&#39;s eyes. All of the eyes that existed on all of the faces on 
Gattai Orochi&#39;s body became red as winter cherries. When that happened, 
large cracks started forming on Gattai Orochi&#39;s head portion. The head 
portion also seemed to increase in size, as if something was trying to 
push its way through. Then, the head portion completely cracked open, 
and the red eyes were revealed to belong to the head of a snake, which 
had hatched from Gattai Orochi&#39;s head portion.

The rest of Gattai Orochi&#39;s hull started cracking. Other snake heads 
started hatching from Gattai Orochi&#39;s body, each with eyes just as red 
as the eyes of the first snake that had hatched. One head hatched from 
Gattai Orochi&#39;s hip portion, another head from Orochi&#39;s legs, another 
head from its back, another from its arms, another from its stomach, 
another from its chest, and another from its wing, bringing the total to 
eight.

Then, the entire body of Gattai Orochi shattered and all of the heads 
were revealed to be those of a giant, eight-headed serpent. The creature 
was large enough to cover eight valleys and eight hills, its belly was 
bloody and inflamed, and its back was covered with club moss, Japanese 
cypress, and Japanese cedar. Himeko and Chikane stared in horror at the 
monster towering over the land. &quot;Chikane&quot; Himeko choked, &quot;what is that 
thing?&quot;

&quot;This is Orochi&#39;s true form,&quot; Chikane realized. &quot;The form that Orochi 
had before he was slain by Susanou during the time of the gods. This is 
Orochi in all of his former glory, Yamata no Orochi.&quot;

To be continued...

----------

OMAKE:

Through her tears, Himeko&#39;s expression took on an element of hatred. She 
stood up and clutched the Solar Priestess Blade tightly. &quot;Now you&#39;ve 
done it,&quot; she said. &quot;You&#39;ve made me angry. You won&#39;t like me when I&#39;m 
angry&quot;
