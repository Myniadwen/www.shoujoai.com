<h1>Spiral of Destiny (part 11 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kannazuki/index.html">Kannazuki no Miko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nwarford.html">Nathan Warford</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kannazuki/kannanisou-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Kazuki and Yukihito looked on in stun as Chikane fell to her hands and 
knees, crying. No words were spoken, but the sound of Chikane&#39;s sobs 
conveyed more than words ever could. She was in agony. The physical pain 
caused by the cold was nothing compared to the emotional pain that she 
suffered from having Himeko taken away from her. 

After many long minutes, Kazuki spoke. &quot;Miss Himemiya, we must get to 
the shrine. Come.&quot; Kazuki put his hand on Chikane&#39;s shoulder, intending 
to help her to her feet. 

At feeling his hand on her shoulder, Chikane violently threw Kazuki&#39;s 
arm away. &quot;I can&#39;t...&quot; she cried. &quot;I can&#39;t perform the ritual alone.&quot; 

&quot;You must!&quot; Kazuki exclaimed. 

&quot;Not without Himeko. If Ame no Murakumo is revived with the power of 
only one priestess, she won&#39;t have the power to seal Orochi away and the 
same thing that happened last year will happen again. I&#39;ll lose Himeko 
again and Orochi will just came back next year.&quot; Again, there were no 
words, just the sound of the wind and the sound of Chikane&#39;s crying 
voice ringing throughout the mountains. 

---------- 

Take no Yamikazuchi flew up through the clouds toward the circular 
platform amidst the 8 torii in the Orochi realm. &quot;He&#39;s back,&quot; Rehko 
said, seeing the giant mech flying toward them. 

&quot;Wait,&quot; said Corona as Take no Yamikazuchi grew closer and more visible. 
&quot;That isn&#39;t the same body that left four days ago.&quot; 

&quot;Of course not,&quot; said Miyako with a smile. &quot;Souma has taken Orochi&#39;s 
power into his body. Take no Yamikazuchi is complete now.&quot; By order of 
Tsubasa, Miyako had been observing Souma through the power of her 
mirror. 

Take no Yamikazuchi hovered in front of the number seven torii, allowing 
Souma to jump down from his other self&#39;s shoulder to take his place as 
Orochi&#39;s Seventh Neck. Take no Yamikazuchi then dropped Himeko onto the 
torii beside Souma, the blonde girl giving off a soft cry as she landed. 

&quot;Hime?&quot; Girochi said to himself, seeing the Solar Priestess looking 
around herself in a daze. He grabbed his chain and cried out, &quot;How dare 
you hurt my Hime?!&quot; Girochi rushed at Souma, throwing his chain at the 
Seventh Neck. However, Souma just stood there, calmly awaiting Girochi&#39;s 
attack. As Girochi approached him, Souma simply grabbed a hold of 
Girochi&#39;s chain, spun him around and threw him back the way he came. 
Girochi collided with the tablet between the supports of the number 
three torii, his body digging into the kanji for the number three carved 
into the tablet. 

&quot;Tsk tsk tsk,&quot; said Miyako. &quot;Naughty little brother, Girochi.&quot; Girochi 
growled at his defeat. 

Himeko, now noticing the seven Orochi members around her, cowered in 
fright. &quot;Himeko,&quot; Souma said, looking at Himeko. &quot;Finally, I have you.&quot; 

&quot;Ogami...&quot; Himeko whimpered. &quot;Where am I?&quot; 

&quot;This is the Orochi&#39;s realm,&quot; replied Souma. &quot;I&#39;ve brought you here to 
protect you from the destruction of the world.&quot; 

&quot;No!&quot; Himeko cried. &quot;I want to be with Chikane! I want to be with 
Chikane!&quot; 

&quot;I told you, the Lunar Priestess can&#39;t protect you. I thought that I had 
proven that by bringing you here. She couldn&#39;t prevent me from taking 
you. Don&#39;t you get it? She can&#39;t protect you!&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t care if she can or not. I just want to be with her!&quot; 

&quot;You would rather be destroyed along with the rest of the world than to 
be without some girl that was never supposed to exist in this reality?&quot; 

&quot;He is right, Solar Priestess,&quot; said Tsubasa, approaching Himeko. &quot;Even 
if you manage to get back to your beloved Lunar Priestess, you won&#39;t be 
able to save the world that she lives in.&quot; 

&quot;What do you call a world where you can&#39;t be with the ones you love?&quot; 
Souma asked Himeko. &quot;It&#39;s called Hell! And I don&#39;t want you to live 
through Hell.&quot; 

&quot;No,&quot; Himeko said, &quot;it&#39;s not Hell. As long as I can see Chikane, it will 
not be hell.&quot; 

&quot;Unbelievable...&quot; Souma sighed, handing Tsubasa&#39;s sword back to his 
brother. 

&quot;Souma,&quot; said Tsubasa with a smile, &quot;it is time to enlighten the Solar 
Priestess. Fill her heart with Orochi&#39;s power. Show her that she hates 
Chikane for not being able to save her. Show her that she belongs at 
your side.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, Brother Tsubasa,&quot; replied Souma. Souma approached Himeko, who 
cowered under his form. Souma grabbed Himeko by the scruff of her 
Priestess uniform and brought her to her feet. He pulled apart the 
collar of Himeko&#39;s kimono. Himeko gasped as she comprehended Souma 
undressing her. However, Souma&#39;s intention was not to violate Himeko. It 
was simply to reveal the Solar Mark on the young priestess&#39; chest. &quot;Now, 
Himeko,&quot; said Souma. &quot;It&#39;s time to show you the true meaning of what it 
means to be an Orochi.&quot; 

Souma started moving his hand toward the Solar Mark. Himeko looked at 
the hand extending toward her in fear. She knew that Souma was planning 
to inject Orochi&#39;s evil inside her just like what had happened to 
Chikane year before. &quot;Souma, wait!&quot; she cried. 

&quot;Don&#39;t hesitate, Souma,&quot; Tsubasa counseled his brother. 

&quot;Don&#39;t you remember what you told me?&quot; Himeko asked. &quot;You told me that 
you would always fight for me. You promised to protect me and the world 
in which I lived.&quot; 

Suddenly, Souma&#39;s hand stopped moving forward. &quot;Souma?&quot; said Tsubasa, 
surprised by Souma&#39;s action. 

&quot;You said that you were willing to do whatever you had to in order to 
protect me and try to make me smile,&quot; said Himeko. 

&quot;Don&#39;t listen to her, Souma!&quot; yelled Tsubasa. Tsubasa looked deep into 
Souma, using his power as Orochi&#39;s First Neck to draw out the Orochi in 
Souma. Souma growled as the mark of Orochi appeared on his forehead. 

&quot;You wanted to give me happiness,&quot; said Himeko. &quot;Remember, Souma?&quot; The 
Solar Mark on Himeko&#39;s chest lit up, the power of the Solar Priestess 
attempting to purify Souma&#39;s heart. 

&quot;Souma,&quot; said Tsubasa, his eyes turning red with Orochi&#39;s power. &quot;You 
are an Orochi. You take what you want without regard for others. That is 
what it means to be an Orochi!&quot; 

Souma groaned in pain as the power of Orochi and of the Solar Priestess 
batteled inside him. His eyes were glowing red as he tried to maintain 
his resolve. &quot;This isn&#39;t what I want, Souma,&quot; Himeko said. &quot;If you 
really want to give me happiness like you said, you would send me back. 
You would take me back to Chikane.&quot; 

&quot;You don&#39;t care about her!&quot; Tsubasa cried. &quot;You take what you want!&quot; 

&quot;I...take...what I want...&quot; Souma said to himself. 

&quot;What do you want, Souma?&quot; Tsubasa asked his brother. 

&quot;I want...&quot; 

&quot;What do you want?&quot; 

&quot;I want...&quot; 

Himeko touched Souma&#39;s face, looked deep into his eyes, and said, 
&quot;Please, Souma.&quot; 

&quot;WHAT DO YOU WANT?!&quot; 

The mark on Souma&#39;s forehead that was previously glowing an evil purple 
suddenly turned bright white and he cried out, &quot;WHAT I WANT IS FOR 
HIMEKO TO BE HAPPY!!!!&quot; Souma pushed Himeko as hard as he could away 
from him. Himeko cried out as she fell off of Souma&#39;s torii into the 
clouds below. 

Souma fell to his knees, panting heavily, the red glow in his eyes 
disappearing along with the mark on his forehead. &quot;You disappoint me, 
Souma,&quot; Tsubasa grumbled. &quot;I thought that you could keep your composure 
better than this.&quot; 

&quot;Did I just see what I thought I saw?&quot; exclaimed Korona, her mouth 
hanging open. 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Rehko, &quot;the Seventh Neck pushed the Solar Priestess away.&quot; 

&quot;Does the Solar Priestess really have that kind of power?&quot; Miyako 
wondered. 

&quot;They did lock us away in our past lives, nya,&quot; Nekoko replied to 
Miyako. 

&quot;I can&#39;t do this, Brother,&quot; breathed Souma. &quot;I try to take what I want, 
just like an Orochi would. But...I just can&#39;t.&quot; 

&quot;Are you going to betray us again, Souma?&quot; asked a very agitated 
Tsubasa. 

Souma sighed and said, &quot;No, Brother. I&#39;m not going to betray you.&quot; Souma 
looked up at Tsubasa through teary eyes and said, &quot;You&#39;re my brother. 
After all that&#39;s happened, I can&#39;t betray you. But I can&#39;t hurt Himeko 
either.&quot; 

&quot;Does it really matter?&quot; muttered Girochi. &quot;That stupid shrine is 
destroyed anyway. The Priestesses can&#39;t bring back Ame no Murakumo even 
if they are together.&quot; 

&quot;No,&quot; said Souma. &quot;They can.&quot; Everyone looked at Souma in surprise. 
&quot;There&#39;s another shrine.&quot; 

&quot;There is?&quot; asked Miyako. 

&quot;Deep in the mountains. That&#39;s where I found them when I captured 
Himeko. Takeshi Himemiya told me about it.&quot; 

&quot;Himemiya?&quot; asked Korona. 

&quot;You mean the Lunar Boob&#39;s father?&quot; Girochi asked. 

&quot;He has some strange power in him to control the Orochi,&quot; said Souma. 
&quot;He can&#39;t be the Eighth Neck. I didn&#39;t sense that from him.&quot; 

&quot;Could it be...?&quot; Tsubasa said to himself. 

---------- 

Himeko felt herself falling, falling without end. At first, she was so 
frightened that she could not bring herself to open her eyes. However, 
when she realized that she had not hit any ground, her fear started to 
disappear and the opened her eyes. When she did, she found herself in a 
starfield.  Below her was a large, blue ball. She realized that the blue 
ball was the Earth. To her right was the moon. But what she was 
transfixed on was the object to her left, the sun. 

The warmth of the sun seemed to surround her. It was as if the rays of 
light from the sun were wrapping around her. And in the sun&#39;s embrace, 
Himeko felt safe. 

---------- 

Kazuki and Yukihito continued to watch as Chikane weeped. Although the 
blizzard was still raging, Chikane would not move. Snow was piling up on 
top of her and her tears were beginning to freeze to her cheeks. &quot;What&#39;s 
happening, Sensei?&quot; Yukihito asked at seeing Chikane&#39;s condition. &quot;I 
thought the Priestess uniform was supposed to protect her.&quot; 

&quot;The uniforms enhance the power of the Priestesses,&quot; Kazuki explained. 
&quot;If Chikane does not use her powers, the uniform will not protect her.&quot; 
Kazuki reached for Chikane again. &quot;Chikane, please,&quot; said the shrine 
keeper. &quot;We must get to the cave before you freeze to death.&quot; 

&quot;I d-don&#39;t c-c-care,&quot; Chikane shivered. &quot;I let H-H-Himeko d-d-down-n. I 
let h-her be t-t-taken away f-from m-m-me. I c-c-couldn&#39;t p-protect her. 
If I c-can&#39;t do that-t-t, I d-don&#39;t deserve t-t-to live.&quot; 

&quot;Miss Himemiya!&quot; Kazuki cried. 

Just then, the Lunar Mark on Chikane&#39;s back lit up momentarily. Chikane 
raised her head and looked out across the ridge. The blizzard was 
starting to subside and she could see a glowing, red speck of light 
falling from the sky toward the mountain at the end of the ridge. Much 
to the surprise of Kazuki and Yukihito, Chikane found the strength to 
stand up. Chikane started moving across the ridge, her strength rising 
with each step. Chikane&#39;s walking became faster and faster until she 
started running. The two shrine keepers had trouble keeping up with her. 

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; wondered Yukihito. &quot;How can she move this fast?&quot; 

&quot;Something is driving her toward the shrine,&quot; said Kazuki. &quot;I have no 
idea what it is.&quot; 

The three of them ran for more than an hour across the ridge, but 
Chikane did not slow down. She continued running as fast as she could 
without letting the cold get to her. At the end of the ridge, Chikane 
suddenly stopped running and looked in awe at the sight before her. 
There was a gap in the clouds overhead and sunlight was shining down 
onto exactly one spot on the mountain. And in that single beam of 
sunlight was Himeko! The blonde had her hands clasped, her middle and 
index fingers sticking out as if she was performing a Shinto ritual. The 
Solar Mark on Himeko&#39;s chest was glowing brightly and her feet were 
hovering several inches off the ground. Her eyes were glazed over as if 
she was in a trance. Her body seemed to give off an aura, which had 
melted all of the snow in a 2-meter radius, vegetation visible beneath 
her feet. 

&quot;Sensei, what is this?&quot; asked Yukihito in awe. 

&quot;This time,&quot; replied Kazuki, &quot;I am completely at a loss.&quot; 

&quot;Himeko...&quot; said Chikane, walking closer to the blonde girl. She reached 
out and took Himeko&#39;s hands in her own. As she did so, the life returned 
to Himeko&#39;s eyes, the Solar Mark disappeared, and her feet floated back 
down to the ground. 

For a moment, Himeko looked around her with a confused expression on her 
face, as if she did not know what had just happened. She then noticed 
the dark-haired girl standing in front of her and said, &quot;Chikane...?&quot; 

&quot;Himeko...&quot; Chikane said, tears streaming down her cheeks. 

Tears came to Himeko&#39;s eyes as well and she cried out, &quot;Chikane!&quot; Himeko 
jumped into Chikane&#39;s arms and the two girls held each other tightly. &quot;I 
was so scared, Chikane!&quot; Himeko cried. &quot;I was so afraid that the Orochi 
would turn me to their side, that I would become the Eighth Neck and try 
to kill you.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Himeko,&quot; cried Chikane. &quot;I&#39;m sorry that I couldn&#39;t protect 
you from Ogami. I&#39;m sorry Himeko! I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; 

&quot;No, don&#39;t be sorry. It doesn&#39;t matter to me. Nothing matters to me as 
long as I can be with you!&quot; Himeko took Chikane&#39;s face in her hands and 
kissed her. Chikane pulled Himeko close to her and kissed her back. 

For several long minutes, the two girls stood there, embracing each 
other tightly. Chikane looked at Himeko again and said, &quot;I&#39;m happy 
that...you&#39;re.........&quot; Chikane trailed off. Himeko suddenly knew that 
something was very wrong as Chikane grew heavy and started to let go of 
Himeko&#39;s body. Chikane managed to finish her sentence, &quot;...safe,&quot; before 
collapsing in front of Himeko. 

&quot;Chikane!&quot; cried Himeko. 

&quot;Quickly,&quot; commanded Kazuki, &quot;get her into the cave!&quot; Kazuki and 
Yukihito held Chikane by the shoulders and Himeko picked her up by the 
legs. Several meters away were two large rocks, each one with a circular 
paper streamer wrapped around it. Between the two rocks was a wooden 
torii, which led to the entrance of a cave. Having identified the former 
location of the Ogami Shrine, Kazuki, Yukihito, and Himeko  quickly 
carried the unconscious Chikane in. 

---------- 

Chikane&#39;s body heat had caused the snow on her priestess uniform to 
melt, which had soaked the uniform with near-freezing water, so their 
first priority was to get Chikane out of her clothes. Yukihito and 
Himeko performed that task while Kazuki started a fire. &quot;We need to keep 
Chikane warm,&quot; said Kazuki in an authoritative manner. &quot;Get a blanket.&quot; 
Himeko quickly obeyed Kazuki&#39;s orders and reached into her bag, taking 
out a large blanket and wrapping it around Chikane. Chikane was 
shivering violently and her skin was extremely pale. It was hard for 
anyone to believe that she had managed to run all the way to Himeko 
before passing out from hypothermia. 

&quot;We must give Chikane a chance to regain her strength,&quot; said Kazuki. &quot;Be 
very gentle with her; if her condition is bad enough, rough handling 
could cause her heart to stop.&quot; Himeko gasped at the prospect. &quot;What is 
most important is to keep her still and keep her warm. We should rest 
now. We need to regain our strength after our journey, as well as ensure 
that Chikane will not be disturbed.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll stay with Chikane tonight,&quot; Himeko stated. 

&quot;Good,&quot; said Kazuki. Kazuki and Yukihito set up their sleeping bags and 
slept next to the fire. 

Himeko gently laid Chikane down and got under the blanket with her. 
&#39;She&#39;s so cold,&#39; Himeko thought as she touched Chikane&#39;s skin. Chikane 
was still shivering and her breathing was quick and shallow. Himeko knew 
that she needed to help her beloved warm up. She untied the obi of her 
Priestess uniform, dropped her pants, opened her kimono, and wrapped her 
arms and legs around Chikane. Himeko winced as Chikane&#39;s cold skin came 
in contact with hers. However, she knew that she had to endure so that 
her own body heat would warm Chikane. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Chikane,&quot; Himeko whispered to her beloved. &quot;I&#39;m not going 
to go anywhere. I will not let you die of the cold. Let my body warm 
you. Let the sun shine upon the moon. Bathe in the sun&#39;s light and let 
the sun warm you.&quot; The Solar Mark on Himeko&#39;s chest glowed as she held 
Chikane in her arms. It glowed with the brilliance of the sun and it&#39;s 
heat kept Chikane warm. 

After several minutes, Himeko felt Chikane&#39;s shivers begin to subside. 
The color began to return to Chikane&#39;s face and her breathing became 
deeper and slower. Himeko smiled in relief when she knew that Chikane&#39;s 
condition was improving. &quot;Thank goodness,&quot; Himeko said. She embraced 
Chikane tightly and she heard Chikane sigh happily in her sleep. 
Although not having suffered hypothermia, Himeko was just as tired as 
Chikane was after their 5-day, 60-kilometer journey. Himeko fell into a 
peaceful sleep, not once loosening her grip on her dear, precious, 
beloved Chikane. 

To be continued... 

---------- 

OMAKE: 

Kazuki and Yukihito woke up early the next morning to find Himeko and 
Chikane together under the blanket, both of them wrapped in the uniform 
of the Solar Priestess. Kazuki smiled and said, &quot;It looks as if 
Chikane&#39;s condition has improved.&quot; 

&quot;You know, Sensei,&quot; said Yukihito in a sultry voice, &quot;I think I&#39;m 
feeling a little cold too.&quot;
