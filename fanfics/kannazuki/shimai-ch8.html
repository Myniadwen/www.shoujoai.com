<p>Reverend  Ohgami was not happy. He hadn't been convinced of the wisdom of  Chikane's plan to begin with, and the sight of Himeko dressed as the  Solar Priestess merely redoubled his doubts.</p>
<p>&quot;This  is wrong,&quot; he said, even as he led the girls through the thicket  behind the shrine. To say that their course was off the beaten path  was no more than the simple truth--there were paths through the  forested area, but the route they took was not on them. Only the  Ohgami family knew the series of landmarks--not even trail signs, but  simply a series of natural features, a particularly gnarled root <em>here</em>,  a split-trunked maple <em>there</em>,  and so on--that led to the hidden shrine. Himeko was sure she  wouldn't have been able to find it herself; while she'd gone there  twice in her previous life (and who knew how many times in the  forgotten lives before that) it was too long ago and things were too  different.</p>
<p>Chikane  didn't seem to have that problem; certainly she showed no hesitation  as she picked her way through the trees. She didn't seem to really  be following Ohgami so much as traveling in the same direction. For  her part, Himeko was just glad the priestess outfits had sandals for  footwear instead of wooden <em>geta</em>.   She'd worn those once in the course of a class project and if she  had to walk through the forest in them she'd snap an ankle after  three steps.</p>
<p>&quot;She  is not the Solar Priestess. She should not be wearing those  vestments, nor entering the sacred ground of Ame no Murakumo. It  mocks the sanctity of the rite and may rouse the god's wrath.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If  it wasn't for Himeko, Yamata no Orochi would have won last time. I'm  the one who should incur Ame no Murakumo's anger if it should fall.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Be  that as it may be, she has no power. She can add nothing to the  ritual and indeed may put it, and even herself, at risk!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Reverend  Ohgami, I have heard all of those objections before,&quot; Chikane  said coolly. &quot;You've said nothing thus far that Himeko didn't  already point out.&quot; The unspoken implication, <em>If  I didn't listen to those objections from her, why would I hear them  from you?</em> hung between them. Miya-sama had made a pronouncement, and that as  far as Chikane was concerned was that.</p>
<p>&quot;If  she herself objected, then why have you insisted upon her presence?&quot;  Ohgami replied, clearly thinking that was <em>not</em> that.</p>
<p>&quot;Because  I feel strongly about this as Lunar Priestess,&quot; she said. There  was just a tone of anger in her voice, only a whisper that no one  else would have noticed, but Himeko did. She took several quick  steps forward and clasped her twin's hand. Chikane turned to look at  her, surprised, and Himeko smiled back. Chikane returned the smile,  and when Himeko released her hand Chikane brushed her fingertips  across Himeko's palm in a subtle caress.</p>
<p>&quot;The  ritual requires two,&quot; Chikane added, her calmness restored. &quot;It  won't work if done alone, and I do not have the power to break the  priestesses' seal by pure force. If it is to work, then I need a  partner, and there can be no one better than Himeko for that, since  she has performed the ritual with me countless times in the past.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Unless  she is no longer the Solar Priestess in the present cycle because of  the will of Ame no Murakumo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If  there is a price to be paid for offending the god, then I will pay  it, but we must press forward or all may be lost.&quot; She then  rather bluntly changed the subject. &quot;Have you made any progress  in determining what shrines might be the ones associated with the  sealed Orochi?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As  to that, we have. There are many shrines throughout Mahoroba, more  than one might expect in a town this size.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,  it is the center of the battle between Ame no Murakumo and the  Orochi,&quot; Himeko pointed out. &quot;The people have good reason  to seek the gods' protection.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's  so, but there may also be another reason.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Camouflage?&quot;  Chikane suggested.</p>
<p>&quot;That's  what Minako speculated as well. The presence of so many shrines may  well be to disguise the identity of those few which are important, to  prevent inadvertent tampering.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  shivered at the thought of an Orochi god somehow being unsealed  during the interval between cycles.</p>
<p>&quot;But  there is a clue. The seals on the Orochi are part of the web of  destiny,&quot; Ohgami continued. &quot;They would actually date to  the beginning of the conflict, to the first time you defeated the god  of destruction. In that way, if we find that a particular shrine or  prayer gate has a specific and limited history, we will know that it  is <em>not</em> one of those we are looking for.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's  good thinking,&quot; Chikane said. &quot;Once we've narrowed down  the possibilities, we can investigate directly, and see if there's  any way we can reinforce the seals or else to interfere with the  Orochi's attempts to break them. Of course, we'll have to be careful  so that we don't end up leading our enemies directly to what they  need.&quot;</p>
<p>The  priest nodded. If he was going to respond, though, it was lost when  the trees parted and they found themselves staring at the hillside.   The leafy canopy was so thick they'd come up on it without Himeko  even noticing that it was there. The rock face was bare stone, but  there was a narrow gap in it, the mouth of a cave.</p>
<p>&quot;This...this  cave is technically on the Himemiya estates, isn't it?&quot; Himeko  remembered. &quot;Do you think that they know about it? It would be  pretty bad if Reiko did...&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  frowned.</p>
<p>&quot;I  don't think so. In this world, there doesn't seem to be any  connection between the family and the legend of the priestesses. My  grandfather had schemed from the very beginning to try and take  advantage of the last cycle, but it seems that only the Orochi blood  was passed down to Reiko this time, without deeper meaning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Souma  and Tsubasa talked about 'Orochi blood' before, too,&quot; Himeko  said. &quot;But...I thought the Orochi were people called by  despair, resentment, and hatred for the world?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The  way my grandfather explained it is, the power of the gods can only  manifest through certain bloodlines that have a connection to the  spirit world, like how the Ohgamis are able to use their spiritual  power as shrine guardians. You and I are always reborn into one of  those families, and the Necks of Orochi are members of those  bloodlines who have a deep-seated resentment for the world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So  Mom or Dad might...have been an Orochi?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes;  at least one of them has to carry the mystical bloodlines--I suspect  most people in Mahoroba do. So if they'd been resentful or fallen  into despair, Yamata no Orochi <em>could</em> have called them. But I don't see how anyone with you for a daughter  could hold ill feeling towards the world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Me?  You're the one who's good at everything, Chikane: school, athletics,  student council; if we weren't miko you'd have a brilliant future.&quot; <em>Oh,  geez, I said &quot;we,&quot;</em> she thought an instant later, realizing that wasn't quite accurate.   Chikane didn't notice her slip, though, or maybe just chose to ignore  it.</p>
<p>&quot;They're  proud of me as parents, but it's you who makes them feel loved.&quot;   She shrugged. &quot;To me, our family is just...a place I happen to  occupy for a short time; to you they're a family. I <em>respect</em> Mother and Father for being good people and raising us well, but you <em>love</em> them as a daughter does.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  felt herself blushing furiously.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now,  though, I think we should stop embarrassing Reverend Ohgami with  personal revelations. Shall we continue?&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  nodded, and Ohgami led the way across the threshold.</p>
<p>&quot;This  cave is sacred ground,&quot; he said, &quot;kept sealed by the Ohgami  Shrine. Only by following the proper path can anyone find it, except  one of the priestesses, whose connection to Ame no Murakumo is so  strong that it cannot be tricked by simple ritual barriers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's  another good reason why Reiko probably isn't aware of the shrine's  presence. She couldn't find it on her own. Unless knowledge of the  shrine was passed down in the Himemiya family, then there's no reason  for her to even suspect its existence. Although, as an Orochi she  could find the area if she knew to look for it and break the barriers  by force.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  wasn't really listening to her sister's speculations, being all too  distracted by her own thoughts. The cave walls seemed to be pressing  in around her, looming up as if they were massive weights ready to  fall and crush her. She wasn't claustrophobic; this was something  else, though still a threatening weight in her own mind it was not  the weight of stone but of memory.</p>
<p><em>This  was where it happened.</em></p>
<p>Reverend  Ohgami lit a torch, its dull orange flame replacing the flow of  sunlight as they descended deeper into the cave.</p>
<p><em>This  was where Chikane...</em></p>
<p>Himeko  shook her head forcefully.</p>
<p><em>No!</em> She would <em>not</em> think  of it that way. It had hurt, yes, and it had been terrifying while  it happened, really more from the sudden change in Chikane from kind  and supportive to threatening and cruel than from the actual  violation. But she understood why Chikane had done it: to try and  protect her from further Orochi attack by removing her blood's power,  and also to use the blood from Himeko's first time to prepare to  summon Ame no Murakumo so that all Himeko had to do was wish for the  God of Swords to descend, and yet again to give Himeko a reason to  hate Chikane and kill her in the final battle. In two of those three  goals she'd failed, most especially the third one, but that was the  weakness of plans born in despair rather than reality.</p>
<p>Because  there was a fourth thing, Himeko thought. Chikane...had been  expressing her love and desire for Himeko openly for the first time,  in the only way that her misguided, guilt-ridden mind could believe  such feelings <em>could</em> be expressed.</p>
<p>No,  coming to this cave again did carry a heavy burden of past memories  with it, but they weren't echoes of pain and fear long since put  aside. They were the memories of seeing her beloved in torment.   Tears stung her eyes as she thought, <em>I  will never, never ever let Chikane feel that way again. No matter  how hard it is or how much it hurts, I will always make sure she  knows how I feel about her</em>.</p>
<p>Realizing  that Chikane, too, was probably recalling some of the same memories,  she hurried forward and when Chikane had fallen a couple of steps  behind Ohgami, Himeko leaned in and flicked her tongue against  Chikane's ear. Chikane spun, startled and wide-eyed, and Himeko gave  her a teasing grin. Her sister stared at her for a couple of  heartbeats, and then her expression softened.</p>
<p>&quot;Silly,&quot;  Chikane murmured under her breath. &quot;And...thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko's  smile grew.</p>
<p>&quot;You're  welcome.&quot;</p>
<p>They  descended into the passage, going deeper into the heart of the  mountain. Himeko thought it was odd that they'd call to a god  enshrined on the moon from a spot deep inside the earth. On top of  the mountain would have made more sense to her, somewhere reaching  for the skies. Then again, when it came to ritual and magic she  often didn't understand things. In truth, even when she had been the  Solar Priestess it had often felt like she was just along for the  ride. Strangely, she felt no confusion about the ritual they were  about to perform; every word and movement seemed graven in her heart.</p>
<p><em>I  guess if you do something through a few dozen lifetimes it kinda  sinks in, huh?</em></p>
<p>Eventually,  the passageway widened out into a cave. A series of prayer gates  arched over the stone path as it progressed into the cavern, forming  a boundary between the path and the sacred precincts. On the far  side, the cavern floor was covered over by a large lake of black  water that only dully threw back the light from the priest's torch.   The extension of the passage jutted out into the lake like a pier,  ending directly beneath a massive boulder that descended from the  cave ceiling like a stalactite. The <em>shimenawa</em> tied around it made it look like the boulder was the <em>kami</em> enshrined here, but Himeko knew that wasn't quite right. She wanted  to ask, since she was sure that Chikane and Reverend Ohgami would  both know, but she was embarrassed by her own ignorance.</p>
<p><em>Some  shrine maiden I am!</em> The thought stung at her. <em>I  can't even remember the names of things!</em> Maybe that was why she wasn't a genuine miko any more. Sometimes,  after all, it seemed that her only qualification for being part of  this was her closeness to Chikane. <em>Last  time...I started acting on my own and changing things. Maybe...maybe  Ame no Murakumo just got sick of my blundering?</em></p>
<p>She  wished that she knew the answer. Part of her just wanted to turn and  leave, to end what seemed more and more like a farce with every step,  but she didn't. She couldn't abandon Chikane, regardless of the cost  to herself. Himeko loved her so much that it scared her sometimes.   The choices she'd made, she knew, weren't exactly normal.</p>
<p>Refusing  rebirth in the restored world, condemning her own soul to  imprisonment for the interval between cycles just so she could be  with Chikane?</p>
<p>Choosing  to be reincarnated as twin sisters so that even from birth they never  had to spend a single day apart?</p>
<p>No,  Himeko was too honest with herself to deny it. If Chikane asked  something, needed something of her, she would defy fate or the gods  or any kind of suffering to try to give it. That was all there was  to it.</p>
<p>Reverend  Ohgami lit the lamps mounted along the passage sides, causing the  cavern to come alight with a glow eerily brighter than the two  lanterns should have shed. The water stirred, small waves lapping at  the edges of the stone pier.</p>
<p>The <em>tamagushi</em> were there already, in rests at the base of the first prayer gate.   Chikane took one of the swordlike wooden wands and Himeko the other.   Chikane extended a hand to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Are  you ready?&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  placed her hand in her sister's and nodded. It wasn't <em>quite</em> a lie; she was willing to act even if not prepared for it. Together  as one, they passed through the first <em>torii</em>.   Chikane stepped past smoothly, but Himeko felt something as they  breached the boundary, a nebulous force that seemed to push at her as  she entered the gate, then dragged at her as she emerged.</p>
<p>&quot;C-Chikane,  are you sure this is going to be okay?&quot;</p>
<p>The  next gate was worse, the force more tangible, the pressure on her  body stronger. It was enough to make her stumble as she passed  through, though she caught her balance before falling.</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko,  are you all right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's  these boundaries. I can feel them; they're resisting me. They don't  want to let me pass.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  in that case they should block you completely. That's what the  barriers are for.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe  it's the vestments?&quot; Himeko suggested. &quot;They have their  own power drawn from Ame no Murakumo, so maybe the boundaries  recognize the outfit but not the person wearing it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or  they remember the past but not the present.&quot; Chikane shook her  head. &quot;It doesn't matter. I've danced to Ame no Murakumo's  will enough; I won't be stayed by this.&quot; Her hand squeezed  Himeko's more tightly as they approached the third and final gate,  and she raised the <em>tamagushi</em>.   A silver glow shone from the symbol on her back; unlike normal  clothing the Lunar Priestess's vestments did not seem to hinder the  flow of light at all. Chikane brought the ritual wand down in a  slashing motion, and the hindering force seemed to part and roll  back, offering Himeko no opposition as she stepped through. They  walked the last few feet to stand beneath the great stone.</p>
<p>&quot;D-do  you really think this will work?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It  has to, Himeko. If I'm going to protect you and this world from the  Orochi, I need to truly be the Lunar Priestess, not a phantom of  myself. And perhaps this will also help to find...your successor.&quot;</p>
<p>She  was having a steadily harder time discussing it, Himeko realized.   The search for the Solar Priestess made the blonde think of Reverend  Ohgami, and she looked back up the path to where he stood. He could  not pass the gates--no man could, unless by breaking the barrier  through sheer force--but he awaited the outcome of Chikane's attempt,  disapproving but resigned to it.</p>
<p>&quot;Shall  we begin?&quot; Chikane released Himeko's hand.</p>
<p>&quot;O-okay.&quot;</p>
<p>There  was, at least, no way she could mistake the <em>form</em> of what was to happen. The words, the movements of the ritual were  engraved in Himeko's soul, giving the lie at least to the idea that  she had never been Solar Priestess, that her past lives with Chikane  were a fantasy. Not that she'd doubted, the bond between them being  the only thing that she was still sure of in all this, but proof was  good to have. Chikane was more analytical, less intuitive than she  was, and proof was sometimes needed to make her see.</p>
<p><em>And  yet, Chikane hasn't once asked me if I remember what to do.</em></p>
<p>Had  the thought simply not occurred to her? Chikane assumed things  sometimes, jumped to wrong conclusions. But that wasn't usually  about this kind of thing, but about more basic, how-she-saw-the-world  issues. Not about the practical details of a task at had. So maybe  it was because when Himeko was offering all her protests as to why  this was a bad idea, she hadn't mentioned what would be a sound,  practical objection, so Chikane understood that she hadn't said  anything because it wasn't a valid objection?</p>
<p>Or  maybe the topic had come up in conversation months or even years ago  and Chikane had simply remembered Himeko's answers?</p>
<p>Or  maybe...this was so important to Chikane (why?) that she hadn't <em>allowed</em> herself to ask the question--to even have the conscious thought?</p>
<p>So  many possibilities, some utterly innocent, some laden with emotion.   Himeko didn't know which it was or how to find out or even if it was  something that mattered. It was just something that seemed off to  her, and she noticed it.</p>
<p><em>Probably  because this all seems off to me! Me being here, doing this.</em></p>
<p>Which  brought her thoughts full circle again. This was why she tried to  leave this kind of thinking to Chikane; when Himeko tried it she went  round and round and didn't get anywhere. She trusted her heart, her  intuition and emotions to guide her. After all, if she'd been <em>analytical</em> in her last life she'd have concluded that Chikane was a ruthless,  evil monster dedicated to Orochi, cut her down, and quite probably  wished for a new world without her in it. It was only because she  trusted in her heart that Chikane was a good person--a person she  could love--that she'd found the strength to refuse Souma's logic,  Ame no Murakumo's fate, Chikane's attempts at manipulation.</p>
<p><em>So  what does my intuition tell me is right?</em></p>
<p>She  walked across the pier and took up a position opposite Chikane, about  ten feet away so the tip of the great rock was right over the  midpoint between them. She raised the <em>tamagushi</em> as Chikane raised hers, the girls mirror images of one another. Her  eyes met her sister's, finding a question in them, and she nodded  once, sharply, in reply.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>The  dark sun writhed and burned in the eternally violet sky. Within the  sealed space of Orochi it was always sunset, thought Abe, for it was  so for the world, the last moments of life before the eternal night  fell.</p>
<p>The  mists had rolled back from beneath the eight <em>torii</em>,  revealing that the prayer gates did not simply grow in space but were  affixed to an octagonal structure. The shrine of the eight gates was  largely devoid of ornamentation, of signs of faith.</p>
<p>This  was fitting, thought Abe. The Orochi had no faith. Only pain, and  despair, and <em>hate</em>.</p>
<p>He  knelt in the precise center of the shrine on the bare wooden floor,  the eclipse that was not an eclipse burning above him, reaching out  to the spirit of malice. Abe knew that of the Necks, he was the most  devout, the most purely dedicated to Yamata no Orochi. This was not  pride; even they would have admitted it. The Second, Fourth, and  Fifth were too caught up in their own pain, their own vanity, and  lashed out at the world like children having a temper tantrum. The  Sixth went beyond this but was burdened by the limits of her own  mind. The First was too enthralled by the <em>now</em>,  of <em>being</em> Orochi. The Seventh had embraced the nihilism of the dark sun but  chained it within his own will, the regimented logic of his mind.</p>
<p>Only  Abe, alone among the Necks, had fully given way to the despair. The  man, the self, was empty. The ego of vanity was absent. The sense  of self that gave rise to the will was gone. The man had been  destroyed in the futility of his wife's death, his last personal  debts paid on the bodies of his tormentors. Now there was only  Orochi. He surrendered himself to it utterly, letting the voice of  his own pain be drowned in the malice of untold billions.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p><em>&quot;The  brave and mighty Susanou no Mikoto.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Chikane  felt the power surge up at once as they began, not even at the first  words but before that, at the act of will that called the start of  the ritual. The air in the heart of the shrine grew heavy with  power, a heat rising from the water, descending from the great stone.   She felt her own power rising to match it, the power of the Lunar  Priestess calling to its sealed half.</p>
<p>The  seal was a door, barring her way. Why it existed she had no idea.   To test the priestesses' dedication? To serve as some sort of  balancing force against the restraints on the gods of Orochi? She  could not say. This ritual was a key. Turn it in the lock and the  door would open. So much easier when she'd been Orochi herself; no  key was necessary when one could simply break in the door.</p>
<p><em>&quot;God  of Takemi Katana.&quot;</em></p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p><em>&quot;God  of Iwatsutsu no O.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The  movements of the two girls were like a dance, the graceful motion of  arms, of hands, the way even the billowing sleeves and trailing  jackets blended in, forming part of the imagery. Light and dark, sun  and moon, a perfect harmonious balance was in them.</p>
<p>Reverend  Ohgami had expected as much from Tsukuyo. What surprised him was  Hikari. Ordinarily she was earnest and good-hearted, but graceless  and clumsy. Now, her every motion was an exact mirror of her twin's,  performed in unison without the slightest lag time or hesitation.   Their voices were as one as they chanted, calling upon the <em>kami</em> who sheltered and supported Ame no Murakumo.</p>
<p>He  no longer doubted--and there <em>had</em> been doubts, though left unspoken--that Hikari had been the Solar  Priestess in previous cycles. This ritual was a part of her, and in  it he could see hints of what had once been, the light she had once  shed as <em>Hi  no miko</em>.</p>
<p>It  made him wonder all the more why that role had been taken from her.</p>
<p><em>&quot;God  of Kanayama Hiko.&quot;</em></p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p><em>&quot;God  of Kanayama Hime.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Himeko  could feel the power swell, could feel the lightning as it sparked in  the air. The pressure was almost unbearable. She knew that there  was supposed to be an answer from within herself, the power of the  Solar Priestess calling to what lay beyond the seal. There was no  such call now, nothing arising from within to balance the terrible  pressure without, only Himeko's own will and the ghosts of the past  that inhabited the vestments she wore.</p>
<p>She  began to tremble as the pressure grew, the gathering power swelled.   How long could she bear it? Even if her mind found the strength to  keep on, how long could her body endure?</p>
<p><em>&quot;God  of Tsurugi no Ikusa.&quot;</em></p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p><em>&quot;God  of Tate no Ikusa</em>.<em>&quot;</em></p>
<p>Himeko  was weakening.</p>
<p>Chikane  could sense it, sense the imbalance in the power being summoned, how  it threatened to rage out of control. She wanted to stop, to pull  back, but it was too late for that. If they hesitated now, the  gathered force would be released explosively. Injury was likely, and  for one without any magic of her own like Himeko, death was quite  possible.</p>
<p>Because  of her. Because of her insistence that they proceed with this rite.   Because she needed her full power as a priestess to protect, and  ultimately restore.</p>
<p>Because  she'd hoped against hope that if they could breach the seal they'd  find beyond it not some but all of the Solar Priestess's power, that  Himeko would be restored to herself by the sudden influx of divine  force.</p>
<p>Because  the alternative was too terrible to bear.</p>
<p>If  Himeko was not the Solar Priestess, but Chikane had to go on as Lunar  Priestess...</p>
<p>She  couldn't think about that. The consequences were...</p>
<p>As  lightning crackled around them, crawling across the surface of the  great stone above and arcing to the water, a trembling began to creep  into Chikane's body as well.</p>
<p>But  not from the external forces pressing upon her.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Along  with the powers of the eight million gods.&quot;</em></p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p><em>&quot;I  wish for the revival of Ame no Murakumo.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The  ritual pounded through the ether. Yamata no Orochi could sense that  its foes were acting, and so Yuujirou Abe felt it through the  communion he shared with his god.</p>
<p><em>They  act! They act to unseal the God of Swords! They strive to shatter the  barriers while I lie chained!</em></p>
<p>Abe  felt the god's cries within his mind. Orochi's hate and fury was as  his own. The eight gods had to rise up, to claim the blood of a pure  priestess so that they could join as one and lay waste to all that  was, to end a world that was hopelessly, irredeemably corrupted by  the stinking ill-will of humanity, a plague on creation that could  only be cured by absolute eradication.</p>
<p>There  had to be a way, somehow, to free the chained darkness and match the  steps of their adversaries.</p>
<p>A  footfall brushed the floor behind him. Words fell softly from lips.   There was no need for them to be audible to any but their speaker,  for they matched those that reverberated through the will of Orochi.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Release  the God of Susanou.&quot;</em></p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p><em>&quot;The  atoning life shall be driven out.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Hikari  was faltering.</p>
<p>Reverend  Ohgami could not deny it. At first it had appeared that Tsukuyo's  will had triumphed over all his doubts. Hikari had approached the  shrine past boundaries he himself could not cross. She had not been  struck down by the God of Swords. She had known the ritual as if she  had studied it for her entire life.</p>
<p>But  now...</p>
<p>There  was pain in her voice. Her whole body shook. Every movement she  made was a halting thing, an effort made against terrific pressure.   While the priest could not see Tsukuyo's face most of the time,  Hikari's was almost in full view and had become a mask of  determination. Perspiration streamed down her skin, her teeth were  clenched, and words forced through them when necessary, her eyes  burned with an intensity that he could scarcely believe.</p>
<p>He'd  known the twins nearly all their lives. Hikari and his own daughter  had become friends almost from the first day of kindergarten. In all  those years, Ohgami had thought of her much as he would regard a  piece of candy: she was a kind, sweet, obliging girl, one whom even  if she didn't observe the proper forms of politeness always captured  the respectful spirit that was meant by them, but one with nothing  hard at the center.</p>
<p>Marika  had never gone along with that assessment. Once, when she was  fifteen and they, in the way of fathers and daughters, had been  arguing over something, he'd foolishly accused Hikari of being  empty-headed and weak, a pointless friend. He'd apologized later,  but in the heat of the moment Marika had snapped back that he was a  blind fool if he couldn't see that Hikari was the strongest person  she knew.</p>
<p>Now,  he understood something of what she'd meant.</p>
<p>They  pivoted, turned, raised their wands, and struck as if cleaving some  opponent that stood in the center between them.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Shinchoku.&quot;</em></p>

<p>As  the last word left her lips, Himeko gave way to the forces bearing  down on her. With a whimper of pain she dropped to her knees. The  important thing, though, was that she'd gotten through it, completed  the rite.</p>
<p>As  she succumbed to unconsciousness, she had no idea if the explosive  roar she heard was from the energies being released or just her own  mind giving way to the pain.</p>

<p><em>A/N:  Shinto terms are all taken from Wikipedia. The chant for the ritual  summoning is taken word-for-word from the anime subtitles. The  description of the hidden shrine comes from the manga, of course (as  do several of the previous-cycle plot events Himeko alludes to). And  the fact that the Orochi shrine actually has a main body instead of  just being the eight gates is also another manga/anime difference (if  this keeps up, these author's notes are going to end up cataloguing  everything that changes between the versions!).</em></p>
