<h2>a <a href="../kannazuki/index.html">Kannazuki no Miko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dezopengiun.html">DezoPenguin</a><br> </h2>
<p><i>A/N: Essentially, this is a retelling of the end of the manga, 
only taken from Himeko's point of view. Most of the inner thoughts we get in the manga 
during the last two chapters are Chikane's; we get to see Himeko's thoughts only when she 
expresses them out loud--and while Chikane's walking up the stairs talking to Ame no 
Murakumo we don't see Himeko at all (to create suspense, of course, making us think that 
Chikane will end up sealed alone), so we don't see her thought process as she reaches that 
decision.</i></p><p><i>Having spent </i>waaaaaaaay<i> too much time turning Himeko's 
personality and character over and over in my mind while writing </i>Kannazuki no Shimai<i>, 
this one-shot was the result.</i> <i>Oh, and the "Chikane-chan"s are back, because with only 
Himeko, Chikane, and Ame no Murakumo to worry about, I know I'm not going to make any 
who-calls-whom-what mistakes!</i> <i>Several lines of dialogue are direct quotes. And as you 
might guess, there are all kinds of spoilers ahoy, for the two of you reading this who don't 
already know how </i>KnM<i> ends...</i></p><p align='center'>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
- - - -</p><p>"Noooo! Chikane-chan!" Himeko screamed as the Lunar Priestess was torn out of 
her arms by the divine wind. She'd tried so hard to get through to find the truth behind 
Chikane's actions, the bleak wall of hate and despair that had made her Orochi, and what 
she'd found was...herself.</p><p><i>My fault.</i></p><p>Well, maybe not "fault" in the sense 
of blame, but it was at least <i>because</i> of her. Because Chikane had fallen deeply, 
passionately in love with her, and believed that such a love could never be returned. 
Because the fate of the Solar and Lunar Priestesses was to be reborn again and again to 
fight Yamata no Orochi, only to be torn apart from each other each time by the ritual of 
sacrifice, where one priestess slew the other to provide the spark to remake the ravaged 
planet.</p><p>So Chikane had tried her best to make Himeko hate her, to see her as a 
monster, committing horrific sins against Himeko personally as well as the world at large, 
all so that Himeko would cut her down and then choose a new world which ended the cycles of 
destruction and rebirth, a new world where Himeko could make a happy life for herself and 
Chikane would be consigned to eternal oblivion.</p><p><i>But it </i>is<i> my fault. I didn't 
see what Chikane-chan was feeling! I didn't see her pain until it was too late. If I hadn't 
been blinded by my own stupidity I might have seen it all before she had to do all 
this!</i></p><p>She'd been so ignorant. Sharing her first kiss--<i>second</i>--with Souma 
Ohgami, never realizing how it hurt Chikane. Or believing that it was Souma whom Chikane 
loved! She'd spent whole <i>lifetimes</i> together with Chikane. How could she have been so 
blind, so idiotic as to miss <i>everything?</i></p><p><i>How could someone so ignorant as me 
have been Solar Priestess so many times? How could I have helped anyone?</i></p><p>Only now 
at the last, on the moon at the end of things, was she starting to understand a little more. 
The pain of past separation. The horror of the ritual of rebirth, how Chikane had always 
borne the burden of striking her down while she, Himeko, had taken the easy role, to die 
without having to raise a hand against her twin soul. Far, far too late had she seen how the 
suffering had warped Chikane, worn away her kind and loving heart until she was a shell of 
herself.</p><p>The thought fluttered at the edge of Himeko's mind like the brush of a bird's 
wing that perhaps this was <i>her</i> price, that her unspeakable ignorance to others' 
feelings and passive submission to their actions was her own soul's way of curling into a 
ball and hiding from the weight of the cycles of pain and sorrow.</p><p>Only when she'd 
summoned Ame no Murakumo had she overcome that weakness, made the first cracks in the shell 
she'd erected between herself and the world. Slowly, surely, she'd fought her way back to 
herself, faced up to her love for Chikane, admitted it to herself, then gave it 
voice.</p><p><i>But Chikane-chan didn't believe me. </i>Couldn't<i> believe me, because I'd 
let her fall too far into her own despair</i>.</p><p>And so Chikane had laid rough hands on 
her, trying to convince her that Chikane's "love" was a frightful thing. And in its way it 
<i>was</i> frightful--Himeko's body had responded so easily, so eagerly to her beloved's 
touch that it was a little scary. <i>I...I want Chikane-chan as a lover. I don't admire her 
as a school idol, or care for her as a best friend, or share destiny with her as Solar and 
Lunar Priestess. I </i>love<i> her. I want to kiss her and hold her, to share her joy and 
support her when she suffers. And...and...to do those things with her that she 
wants.</i></p><p>Only Chikane had been too lost in despair to realize. She hadn't understood 
that Himeko's body didn't respond mechanically to what she was doing but because it was 
Chikane doing it. She'd been too blinded by her delusion that "pure" and "innocent" Himeko 
couldn't have such feelings for another girl.</p><p>So Himeko had pushed her away, though 
her body ached for it. Pushed her away because she was still breaking through the wall of 
her own ignorance and because she didn't want...<i>that</i>...to be under false 
pretenses.</p><p>Taking that step, determining her own fate had given her the strength to 
see Chikane's true intent at last, but it had been too late again. She'd tried to apologize 
for being so slow to see, but Chikane had only been shaken momentarily, not stopped. She'd 
killed Souma, had sent Yamata no Orochi and Ame no Murakumo tearing each other to shreds as 
they'd plunged into that terrible abyss where Orochi had been sealed. And with the echoes of 
that act still ringing in their ears she'd tried to kill <i>herself</i> since Himeko 
wouldn't do it for her.</p><p><i>At least that time I acted!</i> Himeko had thrown off her 
shock and acted at once, diving forward to catch Chikane's hand before she fell. Maybe it 
was that--finally taking a decisive, <i>active</i> step--or maybe it was her terror at the 
fear of losing Chikane, but she finally understood it all: the roles of the priestesses, the 
source of their shared pain, and most of all the full depth of her own true feelings for 
Chikane.</p><p>Only to at last be unable to hold on any longer, forced to let go when her 
body betrayed her. She'd screamed in the depths of her soul, then.</p><p>And Ame no Murakumo 
had answered its shrine maiden's prayer.</p><p>Shining a brilliant golden, the god had 
ascended from the abyss with Chikane cupped unharmed in its gigantic palm. No longer was it 
merely a source of power to be wielded by its followers; the defeat of Orochi in this 
lifetime had unleashed the divine will of the God of Swords, summoned to them by Himeko's 
call.</p><p>She'd heard Chikane's startled cry--<i>so cute, seeing Chikane-chan surprised 
and off-balance!</i>--of "Ame no Murakumo? But why? How?" and had done her best to give an 
answer, running to the other girl as the shining deity set her down. She'd seized Chikane by 
the shoulders and kissed her full on the lips, silencing her questions, her protests. 
Perhaps she'd known it would have to come to this. Himeko wasn't eloquent. She was honest 
and earnest, but she didn't have the power of words the way Chikane did. Just as Chikane's 
actions had drowned out Chikane's lies, so too would Himeko's actions have to drown out her 
silence to make Chikane know her heart.</p><p><i>"H-Himeko...?"</i></p><p><i>"Chikane-chan, 
I..."</i></p><p>It was a start. She'd known it--she'd just <i>known</i> it. She could see it 
in Chikane's eyes, her face.</p><p>Only to have her torn away, swept off by the power of the 
god who had saved her.</p><p><b>The time has come,</b>Ame no Murakumo's voice echoed out. 
<b>Orochi may lie defeated, but the world has been stripped of life and one of the 
priestesses bears a mortal wound. If you wish to seal Yamata no Orochi within this shrine, 
it must be done now.</b></p><p>And now it turned to Himeko directly.</p><p><b>Solar 
Priestess. Using the power released by the Lunar Priestess's soul, you may revive one of 
eight possible worlds. Choose.</b></p><p>"What?! B-but...I can't! You can't expect me to 
choose one!" <i>Chikane-chan! I need Chikane-chan!</i></p><p><b>You must. Only you can 
preserve the future of the world.</b></p><p>"But Chikane-chan!"</p><p><b>The power released 
by the dying priestess's soul is the spark that sets the renewal alight. She must be sealed 
within the shrine or the rebirth cannot happen.</b></p><p>"I...see."</p><p>Himeko felt tears 
welling up in her eyes.</p><p>"But that's so horrible! I don't want Chikane-chan to be alone 
any more! She's suffered so much already, all for me!"</p><p><b>It is impossible. She will 
be reborn only when the power of Orochi rises again in humanity's 
hearts.</b></p><p><i>There's something there</i>, Himeko thought. Something in what Ame no 
Murakumo was saying, or maybe <i>not</i> saying. Something important. <i>If only 
Chikane-chan was here, she could figure it out, I'm sure!</i> But Chikane wasn't there; that 
was the whole problem. She would have to remain within the Lunar Shrine until the next cycle 
began, while Himeko would be reborn into the world, an ordinary soul like all of the others 
given life again by Chikane's sacrifice.</p><p><i>No, wait</i>.</p><p>"Ame no Murakumo...do 
I <i>have</i> to be reborn?"</p><p><b>Explain yourself.</b></p><p>"You said that 
Chikane-chan has to stay within the shrine, or else the world won't be remade...but can't I 
stay with her? You don't need <i>me</i> to resume my own life, do you?"</p><p><b>You would 
refuse rebirth? You would condemn yourself to be imprisoned again, your soul not to be freed 
for years or centuries--or perhaps never?</b></p><p>"Of course! I don't care about living in 
a world without Chikane-chan in it! Even if it means I have to be locked away forever and 
ever, it's okay, if I'm with her. I've...I've hurt her so many times, but if there's 
anything I can do, I won't leave her alone! I...I love her so much..." She could scarcely 
breathe; her heart was in her throat.</p><p><b>That choice is quite possible, Solar 
Priestess.</b> Was it only Himeko's imagination, or did the god actually 
sound...amused?</p><p>"Then I've decided. The world I choose is one where everyone can 
forget the pain they've endured, where whatever made them suffer or hurt is gone...and a 
world without me in it."</p><p><i>I was so slow to realize it, Chikane-chan, but don't 
worry. Even if it takes forever and ever, I'll make sure you know my true feelings! I won't 
let us ever be apart again!</i></p>
