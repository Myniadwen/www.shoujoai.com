<p>&quot;What  is this place?&quot; Saori asked.</p>
<p>&quot;The  Ohgami Shrine,&quot; said Ozawa. &quot;The place where, I believe,  we'll find the Lunar Priestess.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here?  Why?&quot; said Kei. &quot;We haven't gotten a whiff of her anywhere  over the last two hours, and now you're suddenly convinced that this  is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There  are two reasons. One, this is the home of her sister's best friend.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Reiko  told us all about Tsukuyo Asamiya, remember? Were you asleep in  class?&quot; Saori mocked him.</p>
<p>&quot;When  hunting, it is best to know the prey as one knows oneself,&quot;  Akemi added, then said viciously, &quot;We'll root out all her  boltholes until she has nowhere left to hide.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What  bug crawled up your ass anyway, Sixth? You didn't get such a hate on  after she kicked you around, but lately you've been talking like  she's some kind of monster.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You  saw what she did to Reiko and you can still ask that? She didn't just  fight her, she <em>preyed </em>on  her, crippling her mind. I won't let a fiend like that survive.&quot;</p>
<p>Ozawa  had suspected as much. A fellow Orochi she might be--indeed, one of  his more reliable comrades--but the things that made her the Sixth  Neck were just an extension of what had made her a serial killer, the  sheer despair and rage at a world that spat forth those who preyed on  women. The Lunar Priestess had crossed that line, and had drawn  Akemi's personal, visceral hatred down on herself.</p>
<p>Not  that it mattered, so long as it didn't affect Akemi's worth in a  fight.</p>
<p>&quot;Here  is the second reason,&quot; Ozawa snapped, reining in the debates  among his fractious allies. He manifested his Shadow to protect  himself, then extended his hand towards the threshold, the gate  marking the shrine entrance. Gold lightning flashed, and his hand  was knocked back.</p>
<p>&quot;A  barrier?&quot; Akemi exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;A  barrier against the Orochi, behind which she could hide unseen to our  senses.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then  what do we do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We  break it down.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>Chikane  and Reverend Ohgami felt it at the same instant, their heads snapping  upright. The other three at the breakfast table looked at them,  surprised by the sudden movement.</p>
<p>&quot;What  is it? Do you feel something?&quot; Minako asked.</p>
<p>&quot;The  shrine barriers. They're--&quot; Reverend Ohgami flinched, making  him break off in mid-sentence. &quot;They're under attack.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The  Orochi,&quot; Chikane confirmed. &quot;I can feel their power.&quot;   She got to her feet and led the rush away from the dining room and  down the hall to the same window Himeko had waited at the night  before. From there, she could see them at the entrance gate.</p>
<p><em>Them.</em></p>
<p>&quot;Three...no,  four of them,&quot; the priest said, watching next to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Will  the boundary keep them out?&quot; Marika asked.</p>
<p>&quot;There's  no chance,&quot; her aunt stated flatly. &quot;The holy rites we  practice have nowhere near the power of an Orochi or one of the  priestesses. This shrine's connection to Ame no Murakumo strengthens  the barrier somewhat, as does the fact that the priests have been  performing the proper consecrations for generations on end, but they  won't hold.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  turned to the priest.</p>
<p>&quot;Can  you help me, Reverend Ohgami? I want you to take down the barrier  before the Orochi break through, then raise it again.&quot;</p>
<p>He  nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;I  can do that, but why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To  limit the power they can draw upon. It'll weaken them slightly to  fight in this enclosed space. With these odds, I'll need all the  help that I can gather.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fight!&quot;  Himeko exclaimed. &quot;You can't fight four of them at once!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  don't have a choice. At this close range they'll be able to tell  where I am once the barrier goes down. The best I can do is to  choose the ground that I prefer for the fight.&quot; She paused as  she felt another indrawing of power, the summoning of a Shadow.   &quot;Maybe not even that if we're not fast. Professor Ohgami, would  you help Himeko and Marika get safely out of here?&quot;</p>
<p>Minako  nodded. She had a tight-lipped, serious expression. Marika just  looked scared.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane!&quot;  Himeko protested.</p>
<p>&quot;There's  no time for this. I can't fight as well if I have to protect you,  too, and you--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...I  can't help. I...I understand.&quot;</p>
<p>She  reached out, took Chikane's hand, and squeezed it.</p>
<p>&quot;Please,  stay safe. I...I'll be waiting.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  squeezed back, then pulled her hand away. This was a bad situation,  and she didn't expect that it would get any easier. She wished that  she had time to change into her vestments--they had power of their  own that could add to hers--but there wasn't any.</p>
<p>Professor  Ohgami took Marika by the arm and started leading her back down the  hall. Himeko gave Chikane a last, longing look, then turned and  followed.</p>
<p><em>Please  don't let this be the last time I see her</em>,  she thought, then tried her best to push that thought aside. Any  mental slips of the kind she'd had fighting the Fifth Neck would mean  her end in four-against-one odds.</p>
<p>She  nodded to Reverend Ohgami, and the priest bowed his head, beginning  to incant a prayer.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>Twice  now Kei had slashed the shrine's boundary with lightning, and once  the black panther of Izuhara no Tamazuchi had raked it with claws.   The barrier had held, but not strongly; it wasn't like the seals on  the Orochi gods. Cloaked in the Shadow-armor of Take no Yamikazuchi,  Ozawa punched towards the gate, a sphere of greenish-blue energy  blasting from his fist with the motion. Instead of meeting  resistance, it ripped through the empty space and blasted into the  courtyard surface, scattering chunks of flagstones like shrapnel.</p>
<p>&quot;The  barrier's down! Go!&quot; he snapped, and the four of them rushed  through the inert <em>torii</em>.   At once he sent his will out, hunting for the priestess.</p>
<p>&quot;She's  here!&quot; Saori hissed triumphantly. &quot;You were right!&quot;</p>
<p>He <em>was</em> right. She was present, and this time there would be no escape for  her.</p>
<p>&quot;Find  her! Raze this place to the ground if you have to, but find her!&quot;  he ordered.</p>
<p>As  he led the charge into the courtyard, it did not escape Ozawa how  close this matter was to the one that had led to his downfall. An  enemy in an enclosed space, a troop of soldiers at his back, and  innocent persons potentially in the way. The only difference was  that then he'd regretted the deaths of the innocents and now he just  didn't care. If the Ohgamis got in the way, they could die now  instead of waiting for Orochi to consume the world.</p>
<p>&quot;You  two take the residence,&quot; he told Kei and Saori. &quot;We'll  take the shrine itself.&quot;</p>
<p>He  wondered for a moment what made him instinctively trust Akemi at his  back. Was it just that she'd been with him when he learned about  Abe? Even before that, he'd recommended that she be the one sent  against the Lunar Priestess, so was there something else to it? Trust  in her combat skills? Or maybe it was just that the focused purity of  her hatred made her a known quantity, unlike the conflicted Reiko or  the ego-driven Kei and Saori. If there was a traitor, it was least  likely to be her.</p>
<p>At  this point, though, all of them seemed focused on their present  concern; they divided as he'd ordered without question. They had  only taken a few steps, though, when the blow fell.</p>
<p>It  was like a sudden, sharp spike driven into the base of Ozawa's brain.   He flinched, his next step turning into an imitation of a drunkard's  stagger. More importantly, his connection to Take no Yamikazuchi  wavered; the Shadow-armor faded to translucence for a moment.</p>
<p><em>The  boundary!</em> he realized. It hadn't fallen, but had been <em>taken</em> down and then reestablished. Luckily the pain had only been  momentary, at the instant it went back up and the spiritual tie  disrupted before a new pattern could be established, but he'd be  weaker; they all would.</p>
<p>It  had been in that one moment, too, that the enemy struck.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>In  a fight against superior numbers, Chikane knew, her first priority  was to reduce those numbers. She began to unleash arrows against  them from the residence roof as they writhed from the sudden  disruption of their connection to Orochi caused by Reverend Ohgami's  quick action.</p>
<p>Three  of her opponents she knew. The Sixth Neck she'd fought before; the  man with her was undoubtedly the Seventh, as the attack he'd launched  had been far too reminiscent of Souma Ohgami for him to be anything  else. The other male was just as clearly the Second; Yatsu no  Onokoshizuchi was absolutely unmistakable with its eye-tipped  kraken's arms. Only the second woman was an unknown; was she the  Third, Fourth, or Eighth?</p>
<p>Her  first pair of arrows tore into Izuhara no Tamazuchi, taking the  panther out of existence in the first moment. The third shot hit the  Sixth Neck in the side. The fourth exploded in a blinding flash in  front of the unknown woman and the fifth had been aimed at the Second  Neck but was struck aside by a tentacle.</p>
<p>&quot;Bitch!&quot;  he swore, and his Shadow struck at her. The tentacles ripped a hole  in the residence roof where she'd been standing, but she was already  in motion, leaping off the roof and drawing the Lunar Blade in  mid-jump. She landed lightly in the middle of the courtyard, drawing  upon her enhanced abilities as a priestess to make the leap, and  charged the Sixth Neck.</p>
<p>The  arrow wound should have incapacitated her or at least slowed more  than it had, but she whirled to meet Chikane, a knife in her hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Monster!&quot;  she hissed, charging as if unaware of the blood pouring down her  side. &quot;I'll slice you apart for what you did to Reiko! How  could anyone be such a fiend?&quot;</p>
<p>There  was a haunted look in the blue-haired woman's eyes, reminding Chikane  of their first fight. She'd felt guilt then, a crushing weight of it  that had nearly cost her life, but that had been about Himeko.</p>
<p>That  had mattered.</p>
<p>The  only thing the Orochi's accusations--and what they implied about  Reiko's absence from the fight--inspired in Chikane was satisfaction  that her tactics had been effective. There was nothing to make her  hesitate. Her first cut severed the Neck's knife hand at the wrist;  her second cut took off the woman's head.</p>
<p><em>One  down.</em></p>
<p>There  was no room for any pause, no time for even a moment of triumph; she  ducked and rolled forward as the Seventh punched one of his glowing  orbs at her. The attack shot over her head and exploded harmlessly  somewhere, but a trembling beneath her warned her a second before  flame-tipped, insectlike mandibles burst through the flagstones,  slashing the air behind her before vanishing.</p>
<p><em>Ooube  no Senazuchi!</em> Chikane realized. That identified the unknown Orochi as the Fourth  Neck, for whatever it was worth. There was little time to digest  that information, as the Second Neck was sending another spear-strike  with his Shadow's tentacles at her. Chikane dodged, then as the  extrusions struck home in the courtyard's surface she slashed them,  severing their tips. The stumps recoiled, writhing, and she knew  she'd hurt it. It would definitely regenerate, though, so it only  gave her a limited window of opportunity.</p>
<p>That  was the problem with being outnumbered. Even though one-on-one she  was more powerful and probably more skilled than any of them, Chikane  couldn't stop to use that power against one Orochi without exposing  herself to the others.</p>
<p><em>The  Fourth is probably the weakest</em>,  Chikane thought. <em>She's  all but hiding behind the Second.</em> With the Second weakened, this was a chance to close in and Chikane  took it, zigzagging towards them to throw off the Seventh's aim.   Another of the sparkling orbs flashed by her, blasting a chunk out of  the veranda, and the Second cut her off. He was a boy Chikane's own  age or even younger, dressed like an urban punk. The sneer, the pose  marked him as a wannabe tough guy, not so different from Reiko in  that he was a man of frustrated ambitions and thwarted dreams. He  threw a punch at her that she sidestepped easily, then a spinning  high kick that spoke more of long hours watching ninja movies than  long hours at the <em>dojo</em>.   She ducked the sweeping foot and cut his plant leg out from under  him, nearly severing it at the knee, before moving on the Fourth.   Chikane lunged at her with a thrust she hoped would incapacitate at  least, but something coiled around her ankle, tripping her.</p>
<p>Even  as she went down, she realized what had happened: the Second Neck had  caught her with the stump of a tentacle. She hadn't given him credit  for the will to fight through his wound and keep focus. Chikane cut  her way free, but the Fourth had been given time to react. Summoning  her Shadow, she was suddenly surrounded by a cluster of black,  chittering, clicking bugs, swirling around her like a turning wheel.   They began to glow, turning orange, then red, and them burst into  flame while launching themselves at Chikane like a stream of tracer  rounds. Desperately, she spun the Lunar Blade in an arc, its tip  describing a crude circle of protection, but without mobility she was  forced to block the entire force of the attack with power alone. The  fire built with each insect that drilled against her shield, then  burst in an explosion that knocked her sprawling. Chikane grunted as  her back smacked against the grassy border between the flagged court  and the residence building, then her head hit a second later, making  her vision swim for an instant. Luckily she hadn't hit the stone,  but she was in a bad position.</p>
<p>Suddenly,  the voice of Reverend Ohgami rang out boldly. The priest had emerged  from the door, chanting in a firm voice. His voice soared, he thrust  his hand towards the Orochi, and bright blue lightning burst around  them, crackling across their bodies. They writhed in pain, the  injured Second toppling while the Fourth and Seventh twitched.   Chikane looked up in surprise as the priest sagged heavily against  the rail. Perspiration dotted his face and he was breathing heavily;  calling on the shrine's power had obviously taken a lot out of him.</p>
<p>&quot;Reverend...?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As  the priest of the Ohgami Shrine, it is my duty to guide and protect  Ame no Murakumo's miko.&quot; He smiled faintly at her. &quot;I  will not let this sanctuary against the Orochi be violated without a  fight.&quot;</p>
<p>She  smiled back at him, then pushed herself to her feet.</p>
<p>&quot;I  doubt I'll be able to protect you,&quot; she said honestly.</p>
<p>&quot;I  can apologize to Marika when the world is revived.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You  won't remember that you'd need to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then  neither will she,&quot; he said with a wry humor Chikane hadn't known  that he possessed.</p>
<p>She  launched herself at the Seventh Neck, who was the first to recover  from Ohgami's assault. He stood his ground and faced her rush  calmly, deflecting her first strike with his Shadow-armor and  counterpunching. Unlike his street-punk associate, his moves were  smooth and efficient, showing the unmistakable signs of training. At  close range, it struck her that his face was a familiar one. After  another exchange, it came to her.</p>
<p><em>Junichi  Ozawa--the one the press called the &quot;Slaughterer of Sendai.&quot;</em> That explained his fighting skills: he'd had military training.</p>
<p>&quot;At  least you're consistent, Major Ozawa,&quot; she said. &quot;I guess  obeying orders to murder innocent people is a specialty now?&quot;</p>
<p>He  wasn't Reiko, but Chikane saw the doubt flicker in his eyes. She was  sure he wouldn't break in the same way--he was a grown man, not a  teenage girl with major self-esteem problems and a personal link to  her--but she'd hit on it, the source of his despair and rage, that  which made him Orochi. She struck at it, ruthlessly, even as she  assaulted his body.</p>
<p>&quot;That's  it, isn't it? You were innocent, weren't you? <em>You</em> didn't give the order to fire. <em>You</em> didn't want to kill all those people. It was someone else, wasn't  it?&quot;</p>
<p>She  used her reach to hold him back, to keep him at bay for the next  clash.</p>
<p>&quot;All <em>you</em> were was too much of a sniveling coward to say no.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Got  you</em>.</p>
<p>Chikane  saw the rage rise in him, the burst of temper that threw his  attention off. Power gathered to Ozawa's fist and he punched another  blast at her at point-blank range. The anger had thrown off his  rhythm, the moment to summon his attack delayed him, and Chikane  wasn't in front of it. Instead she slashed under his upraised arm,  putting all her strength into the cut. Her sword disrupted the  armor, dispelling it to translucence, and ripped a deep cut along his  torso. As he was still off-balance, she hooked his leg, got one hand  on his upper arm, and flipped him over to slam hard onto his back on  the flagstones. Chikane whirled, sword ready to spear through his  chest and finish him when the scream cut her off.</p>
<p>She  shouldn't have looked. It was just a glance--a reflex spawned by his  coming to her rescue, that brief moment of shared understanding  between them. It would have made Himeko happy; she was the one who  kept insisting that there was something good, some basic humanity  within Chikane that could still be touched by others.</p>
<p>But  she shouldn't have looked.</p>
<p>In  that moment when she turned her head, when she saw Ohgami's body  being spitted on the flaming mandibles of Ooube no Senazuchi the way  she'd almost been, she lost her advantage. Ozawa acted in that  instant, slapping his hand against the flat of her sword so that her  stab only scored along his ribs instead of spitting him through the  heart. He kicked at her legs, trying to knock her down, and she  avoided it only by skipping aside.</p>
<p>That,  though, opened space between the two of them, and gave the Second  Neck a chance to act. Before Chikane's eyes, his Shadow restored  itself, the severed tentacles regrowing until they were complete  again, and in the tips of all six an eye opened, leering at her with  the same triumphant cruelty as its Neck.</p>
<p>Then  six bolts of violet lightning lashed at her, one from each eye.</p>
<p>Chikane  parried them as they converged, knocking them aside. She knew that  she couldn't stop them all, so she concentrated on deflecting what  she could, sending bolts back at the Second and Fourth. Two bolts,  though, struck her; they lifted the Lunar Priestess off her feet and  left her sprawled at the base of the shrine steps.</p>
<p>The  taste of copper was in her mouth; hot, red pain obscured her  concentration, drowning thought. Fear surged inside her, the animal  instinct fighting to recover, to clear her head. If she'd been  properly wearing the Lunar Priestess's vestments this wouldn't have  happened, the thought drifted past, even though she  couldn't--quite--recall what &quot;this&quot; was.</p>
<p><em>Focus,  Chikane</em>.</p>
<p>It  seemed like hours but was probably no more than a couple of seconds  before the red cloud cleared from her brain and she began to struggle  to her feet. The Necks she'd counterattacked seemed even more  damaged than she was: the Second had managed to nearly clear the  entire board in a single move, like a petulant child sweeping his arm  across a chess game.</p>
<p>Nearly.</p>
<p>The  Seventh was upon her before she could get to her feet. His Shadow  had returned; the damage she'd inflicted on his body was no doubt  regenerating. He fisted his hand in the front of her T-shirt and  lifted her the rest of the way up, then clear off the ground. That  was when it got through Chikane's pain-dazed mind that her hands were  empty, the Lunar Blade knocked from her grip by the lightning strike.   Off the ground she didn't have any leverage to use against him, she  couldn't pierce his armor with her bare hands alone, and his arm,  fully extended, kept her from being able to reach his face and the  vulnerable points there.</p>
<p>&quot;You're  finished,&quot; he said simply, drawing back his fist, no doubt to  blow her head off with another energy sphere.</p>
<p>Then  his eyes went black and unseeing. Blood spurted from his lips.   Chikane glanced down just in time to see the armor fade away,  dispelled by the same sword that emerged from his chest. His grip  slackened in death, and Chikane managed to catch her balance as Ozawa  fell dead between her and the one who'd killed him.</p>
<p>&quot;Professor  Ohgami?&quot;</p>
<p>The  red-trimmed kimono jacket and crimson <em>hakama</em> were all too familiar. The sword in her hand was the twin of  Chikane's own. The blaze of light from the mark on her chest, so  searingly bright even through her clothing that it made Chikane  squint, was what made for absolute confirmation.</p>
<p>&quot;You're  the Solar Priestess? But...but why didn't you tell any of us?&quot;</p>
<p>Minako  smiled thinly.</p>
<p>&quot;Why  didn't I? That's quite a good question. Then again, you always were  a good student, Tsukuyo--or should I just call you Chikane now? It <em>is</em> your 'real' name, at least the one you think of yourself as, after  all. Just why <em>did</em> I carefully keep silent about it all this time?&quot; She tapped her  finger against her lip in a parody of a thoughtful expression.   &quot;Let's see...oh, that's right.&quot;</p>
<p>A  shadow passed across the sky, and the sun symbol's light went out  like a snuffed candle. Minako's eyes filled with seething violet  fire.</p>
<p>&quot;It's  because I'm the Eighth Neck, as well.&quot;</p>
<p>The  shadow seemed to swallow the courtyard as the war-cry of a hawk  shattered the stillness. It dove out of the sky as if plummeting  from the depths of space, a titanic demon, its wingspan at least a  hundred yards across. Its talons crashed into the boundary enclosing  the shrine and tore it apart like it was paper, the gates blasted to  splinters along with several trees in the surrounding woods, the  anchor points of the barrier destroyed by the unsealed god, Yokusemi  no Mizuchi.</p>
<p>In  this incarnation, Orochi's eighth head looked much like a gigantic  brown eagle, the edges of its sagging feathers crusted with black  rot, its eyes a baleful crimson, its beak, feet, and claws all dark  as if carved from obsidian. The sheer power of its presence alone  was all but overwhelming; the remaining Necks could barely stand up  in the face of it and even Chikane was struck with horror. It seemed  almost unthinkable that this demon had once been tied to her own  soul--indeed, that she'd cast it aside in favor of the even fiercer  Take no Yamikazuchi.</p>
<p>It  swung its massive head towards the two quivering Necks, opened its  beak, and let loose a piercing screech. The air <em>rippled</em>,  waves traveling outward from the god's maw. The scream, Chikane  realized, wasn't just its voice, but an attack, a sonic wave  generated by the demon's power. The Ohgami residence wasn't so much  destroyed as vaporized, blasted to dust, as was a good chunk of the  forest behind. The Second and Fourth Necks, who had been forcefully  wielding their power only a moment ago, were torn apart, their  Shadows and their bodies blown away as one.</p>
<p>Chikane  bolted for her sword, but the demon was faster; its talons lashed  out, pinning her down spread-eagled on her back, holding her with  exactly enough pressure to keep her immobile and no more. There was  nothing she could do against a foe that so completely overmatched  her.</p>
<p><em>Is  this how Himeko felt in our last life? Helpless, overmatched,  entirely dependent on someone else to protect her?</em></p>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot;  Chikane asked. &quot;Why are you doing this, Professor?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  glad you asked. It's annoying, wanting to say something this whole  week and not being able to. I only wished my brother was still alive  so I could say it to him, and then kill him myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kill...Reverend  Ohgami?&quot;</p>
<p><em>Keep  her talking. The longer she talks, the more time there is for me to  think of something!</em></p>
<p>Her  face twisted into a mask of hate.</p>
<p>&quot;I  was the eldest Ohgami child. That meant that I was to be the  priestess of this shrine--male and female don't matter to the family  for that. I was trained in the rites and rituals by which we honor  the <em>kami</em>,  the legends that we hand down, the 'sacred duty' we are supposed to  play as your guides and support. As a child I was an eager and  enthusiastic follower of our ways, hoping--yes, <em>hoping</em>--that  your arrival would be during my term and that I could play my part.&quot;</p>
<p>That  sounded so unlike the Minako Ohgami that Chikane knew--not the Orochi  but just the woman, the aunt, the professor--that she could barely  believe it. Her feelings clearly showed, too; Minako smiled wryly at  her.</p>
<p>&quot;You  find it hard to imagine me as a devout little girl, Chikane?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What  changed it?&quot;</p>
<p>The  smile vanished.</p>
<p>&quot;I  went into the world. I attended school., I read history. I learned  about current events, and what I saw made me sick. As a priestess I  was supposed to become a guardian of a sacred tradition, a guide so  people could live happy lives. Instead I saw that far from being  sacred, religion was nothing but a sham. Marx called it the opiate  of the masses, a tool to keep them in line, but he was wrong.   Religion isn't a tool, but a poison in and of itself. It's a bunch  of made-up ideas people imagine so they don't have to feel alone and  helpless in a universe they don't understand. The ideas have no  support, no proof, no evidence, so people cling to every scrap of  them without thinking and call it 'faith.' Then, if anything tries  to challenge those ideas, they try to destroy it so they don't have  to examine their beliefs and see that they're nothing but worthless  hot air.</p>
<p>&quot;You  can't escape it when you look at history! People demand answers to  question no one can know the answers to, and the priests make those  answers up. Then, if someone <em>finds</em> the answers, the 'faithful' fight tooth and nail to suppress the  truth. And because religion is so important to these people, it  doesn't just fight with science but even more so with other  religions! Racial and cultural superiority is always based on it.   Our way is better than your way! Your imaginary afterlife is  different than our imaginary afterlife, so we have to kill you!  Shintoist or Bhuddist, Christian or Jew, Moslem or Hindu, they're all  the same. Every atrocity in history is rooted in some arrant  stupidity characterized as 'faith.'</p>
<p>&quot;It  made me <em>sick</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>She  took several deep breaths, reining in the building fury.</p>
<p>&quot;So  I abandoned faith. I abandoned belief and put my trust only in what  could be proven. And my family just smiled their supercilious little  smiles and said things like 'for those who do not believe, no proof  will suffice' and other pithy axioms which boil down to Because I  Said So. And Takeshi swallowed it hook, line, and sinker. It's <em>always</em> been there between us, that utter <em>arrogance</em> that sooner or later I'd 'come around,' that I'd fall in line with  the family duties sooner or later.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then  why did you agree to move to the shrine when Marika's mother died?&quot;  Chikane asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Because  I wanted to make sure that my niece didn't have her mind poisoned by  their corruption! Even if she does have faith in the beliefs of the  shrine, at least she uses them for what they're supposed to be, a  guide to decency instead of a voice to drown out all rationality or  an excuse to commit all sorts of corrupt acts.&quot; Her lips  quirked upwards. &quot;You know, such as having an incestuous affair  because of a <em>belief</em> that you are reincarnated lovers?&quot; Minako chuckled at Chikane's  sudden surge of anger. &quot;Oh, don't make that face; I know now  that it was true all along.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Control  yourself,</em> Chikane thought. <em>Stay  calm and think!</em></p>
<p>&quot;Isn't  incest itself just another religious taboo, though? So what  difference would it make if we <em>were</em> deluding ourselves?&quot; she stalled for time.</p>
<p>Professor  Ohgami laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane,  nearly every myth-cycle in every religion is <em>filled</em> with incest, particularly among the gods. It's taboo because it's  disruptive to <em>human</em> society, by damaging the family unit through confusing the roles  people occupy in connection to one another. That it's passed off as  God's commandment is the biggest joke about it.</p>
<p>&quot;But  you haven't asked the most obvious question yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You  hated religion because it was a lie. But you're a Neck of Orochi.   You <em>know</em> that the gods are real. So your own despair is a paradox!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is  it?&quot; Minako pretended to ponder the issue. &quot;Just because I  didn't <em>believe</em> in the gods didn't mean that I wasn't paying attention. One deity  which represents the combined malice of humanity intent only on  destroying everything in its path, and another deity who opposes the  first with such callous cruelty that it inspired in <em>its  own champion</em> enough pain and hatred to switch sides? It seems to me that my  impression of religion was absolutely correct--and that its legacy of  violence and hatred is <em>exactly  in accord with the gods</em>.</p>
<p>She  looked down at Chikane, shaking her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Now,  can you explain to me why a world like that should be permitted to  exist, Lunar Priestess?&quot;</p>
<p>She  chuckled again, the pure arrogance of it making Chikane's gut twist.</p>
<p>&quot;But  as entertaining as this has been, I need something from you.   Specifically, the blood of a pure priestess to break the final seal  on Yamata no Orochi. Another of those idiotic rules of the gods; I  can't see why the existence or lack of one membrane within the body  constitutes 'purity.' After all, who seems <em>purer</em> to you, a woman in her forties who's had a few love affairs or a girl  of nineteen who's been consensually bedded by her sister for...what  is it, now, six years? Seven?&quot; She shook her head. &quot;But  there it is.&quot;</p>
<p>Standing  over Chikane, she pressed the tip of the Solar Blade against  Chikane's shoulder and sliced down her left arm. Chikane winced at  the sudden pain, but didn't cry out. She didn't want to give the  other woman the satisfaction.</p>
<p>&quot;And  there we have it,&quot; Minako declared, holding up the sword, its  tip now glistening with blood. &quot;I hope that you and dear Himeko  enjoy the show. There'll be plenty of fireworks, and the ending's a  real killer.&quot;</p>
<p>With  that, Professor Ohgami vanished into black fire. Yokusemi no Mizuchi  spread its massive wings and launched itself into the air, receding  into the sky so fast that in seconds it was barely a fleaspeck,  leaving Chikane staring up at nothing. The shrine courtyard was  still and silent, yet the Lunar Priestess could still hear the echoes  of her world crashing down around her ears.</p>

<p><em>A/N:  And now you can stop wondering about &quot;who?&quot; and start  asking &quot;how?&quot; and &quot;why?&quot; about the Solar  Priestess! Deep congratulations are due anyone whose attention was  grabbed at the first by an atheist from a shrine family and wondered  if there was more to that story, with lesser but still distinct  clue-spotting bonus points for those of you who might have noted that  while Reverend Ohgami was with the girls during the unsealing ritual,  Minako and Marika were both free to be off killing Abe, and that it  was Minako's research and advice passed on by Takeshi to Chikane that  brought Chikane to fight Hirata and give the Eighth the chance to  unseal Yokusemi no Mizuchi--since Minako was the only one who was  suspect in both matters, she was therefore the Eighth Neck. I know  I'm evil with the cliffhangers and all, but I tried to at least play  somewhat fair with the story's major mystery.</em></p>
