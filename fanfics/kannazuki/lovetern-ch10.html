text-indent:.5in'>Unlike most of the children out there in the world, she was
neither born from a motherÅfs womb nor given life in the shape of a little baby.
Her true form aside, her appearance had always been that of a young woman in
her early twenties, fully cognizant of the world at large the moment she opened
her eyes and looked. In her brain lay all the knowledge the Immortals of Heaven
had gathered, that which perhaps all the books in mortal world combined would
not be enough to contain. She even knew of things that human would never
believe existed. In her body, unbelievable strength coursed. In her veins
flowed fierce currents that perhaps held as much energy as the sea did water.
She was what people would place between Gods and mortals, but she was neither,
for she bore no resemblance to both. She was what people would classify as a
weapon, one that boasted absolute powers, inspiring both terror and awe. She
was what they named Sei no Tsurugi no Rinne, the Seraphim Blade.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>RinneÅfs existence began in the laboratory of IzumoÅfs R&amp;D
Division, the so-called most crooked place in the Three Worlds. All that she
remembered was a morning in which she was removed from one of those crystal
pillars filled with transparent liquid and the very same morning in which she
had woken up to white-clad figures whose faces showed as much emotion as a
stone. They talked to her as though she were a guinea pig. They studied her the
way they would an object proved to be most interesting. They scared her with
lightless eyes behind spectacles and with calculating gazes that made her feel
dirty enough to want to take a long bath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Yet, one of those people was different. There was one person
who had approached Rinne, smiled at her kindly, and draped a cloak across her
naked body while the rest never seemed to notice that Rinne was baring her
whole self to the world. It was a beautiful woman with long, luxuriant black
hair who had a smile that warmed oneÅfs heart. That womanÅfs name was Izanami,
the Lady of Reiha as well as the Regent of the Underworld.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>After finding her suitable clothes, Izanami-sama pulled Rinne
aside and explained to her the reason for her makings in a voice that belonged
to a loving mother speaking to her own child. Apparently, Heaven had succeeded
in creating a Sword God whose strength transcended all save the Lord of Heaven,
Izanagi himself. That very Sword God was supposed to act as a Slayer who would
rid the human world of all the demons that plagued the dead of night. That very
Sword God would become her Master, for she, Sei no Tsurugi no Rinne, was a
weapon forged for his sake. The Regent of the Underworld had also revealed to
her that since the Ruler of Heaven was extremely unskilled when it came to
designing weapons &#8211; the Lady then added in an extremely amused voice that
Izanagi could not even forge himself a decent knife to peel fruits &#8211; he had
asked her to be the one in charge of the project. It was her who had provided
the thousand details without which Rinne would never be completed. It had been
then that Rinne began to think of the Regent as her blood mother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Once the explanation was done with, the older woman led Rinne
to the Heavenly Palace, where she was introduced to six High Immortals that
changed her life forever.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;
margin-bottom:.15in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Her first impression of Izanagi the Lord of Izumo was not as
good as she had expected. Somewhere in her mind, she had assumed that since
Izanagi was a Maker just like the Lady of Reiha, he would resemble latter at
least a little bit. She had imagined a fatherly man who would welcome her with
as much affection as the Regent of the Underworld. Rinne could not have been
more wrong. The Ruler of Heaven made those researchers in the R&amp;D Division
look pleasant and friendly, for his face seemed to be made of steel and his
blood appeared to be clogged with floating icebergs. Worse, he had made it
clear to Rinne that he did not intend to see her more than a mere object that
he would use whenever he felt like it. She had decided to forget about the man
the second he finished saying that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Her second surprise came when she met the Goddess of the Sun,
who happened to be the daughter to the man who had violently disabused her of
the thought of having a kind father. The strikingly beautiful eighteen-year-old
Amaterasu was the exact opposite of the Lord of Izumo the way she was vibrant,
cheerful, and did not have an ounce of respect for the rules and regulations
the man set forth. The golden-haired girl was in fact the one who had insisted
that Rinne called her <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Ågnee-samaÅh</span></i>
even though Rinne appeared to be at least several years older than her. The
young girl reasoned that because age was all that mattered and that Rinne
practically was less than a day old, she had to settle for being the youngest.
That in itself amused her so greatly she agreed without a second thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>If Rinne was amazed by IzanagiÅfs cheerful daughter, she was
completely disappointed with the RegentÅfs own child, Tsukiyomi the Goddess of
the Moon. It would have made much more sense had Rinne been told that
Amaterasu-nee-sama was the daughter of Izanami-sama and Tsukiyomi IzanagiÅfs.
Indeed, although the Moon Goddess inherited her motherÅfs regal beauty and
grace, the unsmiling silver-haired girl had none of the LadyÅfs gentle and warm
personality. At the first glance that she received from the girl, she had known
right away that the eighteen-year-old cared naught about someone to whom she
was introduced out of the blue. Although she was by no means arrogant,
Tsukiyomi was simply not the type who could be easily befriended. Even Susanou
and Kagutsuchi had admitted that the Moon Goddess shared with no one what lay
in her heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Rinne soon learned that it was <i><span style='font-family:
"Footlight MT Light"'>not</span></i> true.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The twins had had no idea that Goddess of the Sun, their
beloved onee-sama, was the sole exception to that fact. The golden-haired girl
was the only person in this world to whom Tsukiyomi opened her heart, to whom
she would show her true smile, and for whom she would discard the barrier she
erected between herself and the world. Not that Rinne expected the brothers to
realize what was going on between their blood sister and her childhood friend.
They were only twelve then, too young to understand a maidenÅfs heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>It took Rinne little time and effort to see that her
Amaterasu-nee-sama was special in the silver-haired girlÅfs eyes, for only in
the formerÅfs presence would the latter act the way she would not with anyone
else. To other Immortals, the Moon Goddess was elegance incarnate, the very
quintessence of frost, and an ice block to the core of her existence. In front
of her childhood friend, she, surprisingly, became a girl whose temper flared
every minute. More than once Rinne had had her mouth hanging in disbelief when
she caught a glimpse of the Moon Goddess lashing out her anger at the
golden-haired girl because the latter chose to douse an elderly God with chilling
water. The strangest thing was that even when one was shouting at the top of
her lungs and one meekly sat there and scratched her cheek ruefully, Rinne was
under the impression that both were enjoying themselves to the fullest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The more time Rinne spent around them, the clearer the nature
of their relationship became to her. She always had to refrain herself from
laughing at some unsuspecting God who commented that the golden-haired and the
silver-haired girls were as close as blood sisters. Had that God paid more
attention to the GoddessesÅf eyes whenever they talked to or spoke of each
other, listened a bit more closely to the girlsÅf caressing tones whenever they
uttered each otherÅfs name, and looked at the way they always held hands as soon
as they got near one another, he would have realized that they were in fact
lovebirds who could not stand being apart. Oddly enough, it turned out that
Amaterasu-nee-sama and Tsukiyomi had never confessed their feelings, or even
tried to for that matter. If Rinne had to guess, she would say that they were
just too shy and too inexperienced to admit their love to each otherÅfs face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Interesting as it might seem to see two girls head over heels
in love, Rinne had not cared much about them. Firstly it was because she
thought it nothing out of the ordinary. If a woman could fall in love with a
man, what could stop her from doing so with another woman? <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>None,</span></i> she decided.
Secondly, she was of the belief that whomever the Goddesses of the Sun and Moon
chose for their romantic interest, it was not the business of anybody else,
least of own hers. Thirdly and finally, her attention was all devoted to the
sixth member of the Lord of IzumoÅfs eccentric family... and also the Master
that she was born to serve.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Even if Rinne were to reincarnate twice over, she would never
forget the image of Ame no Murakumo on the day they first met. After the Regent
of the Underworld had finished introducing her to the Goddesses of the Sun and
Moon and the Gods of Fire and Storms, she ushered Rinne to the back garden of
the Heavenly Palace, where they found a ten-year-old boy playing with a flock
of white doves. Despite not being almost girlishly beautiful the way Susanou no
Mikoto was, this boy, whose body was clad in a white yukata, whose hair and
eyes glowed platinum under the sunlight, was definitely more handsome that
most. Truth be told, no one could have believed that the Sword God Ame no
Murakumo, who was rumored to possess enough strength to level Izumo in one blow
and also who was given the title of Demon Slayer, was a little boy who was
dangling his feet atop a stone bench while laughing wholeheartedly at the birds
who were eating at the sunflower seeds in his tiny hands. It was a laughter
with which no chime made by human or Immortal could hope to compete.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Ame no Murakumo, nicknamed Akira by his sister the Goddess of
the Sun, was born the antithesis of all that was evil. As such, he was granted
a soul so pure it made falling snow look dark and a nature that would stay
innocent until the end of time. Kind, sweet, and having a heart that had no
capacity for darkness, Akira was indeed a child parents would be <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>dying</span></i> to have. The Lord of
Izumo was well aware of such a fact, so his eyes always sparkled with pride
anytime someone mentioned his youngest offspring. The man had never realized,
or maybe he had elected not to, that his crazy idea of a perfect Immortal had
caused the boy all kinds of grief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Rinne noticed the symptoms of a disturbed soul shortly after
becoming AkiraÅfs friend. For some reason, the child tended to distance himself
from other people and was liable to escape to a place where he could be on his
own. It was the same even with AkiraÅfs blood siblings. Although he tried not to
show much of his emotions, it was plain as day to Rinne that he was frightened
of his brothers and sistersÅf touches. His face always went a little gray
whenever Amaterasu-nee-sama, Susanou, or Kagutsuchi approached him. In those
times, he always seemed more than ready to run away as though hell was on his
heels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>He never did. Whatever he felt in his heart, he still loved
his brothers and sisters more than anyone else in the world. As long as they
wished, he would stay and play with them even if he always ended up trembling
in some corner of his room afterwards. To her surprise, Rinne was the only one
to whom Akira did not react in the same way. In fact, she was the first person
in Heaven Akira voluntarily approached. She could still remember laughing at
the incredulity on Susanou and KagutsuchiÅfs faces when they first heard Akira
asking Rinne to go play in the garden with him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>As time flowed slowly by, Akira grew more and more attached
to her as their friendship deepened and grew to be a bond stronger than blood.
He would tell her everything he did during the day, and more often than not
recite word by word whatever he had told other people. One day, when Rinne had
earned enough of his trust, Akira told her his little secret, which was the
reason why he kept his distance with other people and why he was not that close
to his siblings despite the fact that he loved them very much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>It turned out that due to his innate purity, Akira was
incredibly sensitive to what lurked in the depths of peopleÅfs souls. The
Immortals of Heaven scared him because they harbored horrendous emotions such
as hatred, lust, greed, and envy deep within their hearts. It was no news to
Rinne, for she was well aware that the Heavenly World, on contrary to what
people might have chosen to believe, was no paradise. Similar to Onogoro, it
was brutal, it was cruel, and it slowly but inexorably instilled darkness into
its inhabitants as surely as acid eating into steel. Sadly enough, IzanagiÅfs
family was no exception to that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Amaterasu-nee-sama and TsukiyomiÅfs love toward each other was
very much a blazing fire, passionate and warm yet at the same time extremely
dangerous. The latter was obsessed with the former to the point that she
developed a jealousy on par with her insane powers. The girl did not look it
but every time the Goddess of the Sun acted too friendly with other people, the
Moon GoddessÅfs blood was boiling with enough heat to burn the City to ashes.
The golden-haired girl should be thankful that her childhood friend would
forget and forgive the moment she smiled to her, for the Sun Goddess would have
been dead otherwise... and long since.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>On the other hand, it was not as though Amaterasu-nee-samaÅfs
soul was any less perilous, it being filled to bursting with thoughts of the
other girl and all. Akira ran the risk of having his consciousness drawn into
maelstrom of love and desire just by being near her. Despite the fact that the
child never said it out loud, Rinne could guess that among the siblings, his
apprehension toward the Goddess of the Sun was the strongest. Sometimes he
could not help but flinch at a touch from her. Sometimes his face would pale to
the color of a sheet of paper at a kiss she placed on his forehead. Usually
after that had happened, the young Sword God would run to RinneÅfs side and
quivered in her embrace until he calmed down. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Susanou and Kagutsuchi did not fare much better than her
sister did. They were only twelve then, yet their souls were by no means
friendly places. For Kagutsuchi, the kindness and gentleness he showed to his
family could not eclipse the fact that at heart, he was hot-headed, violent,
and possessed half the wits of children his age. Susanou no Mikoto, on the
other hand, was the exact opposite. Although the kid was always cool, calm and
collected, he had more than enough share of attitude problem. Being an
egomaniac to the bones, Susanou looked down on other people outside the family
and treated them with barely hidden contempt. To him, they were probably as
lovely as a morbid dog.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Having such siblings, there was no wonder why Akira was so
fascinated with her. Since Rinne was a weapon, neither mortal nor Immortal, the
concept of negative emotions did not apply to her. In AkiraÅfs eyes, RinneÅfs
heart was a crystal ball, transparent, clear, and untainted. While Heaven
itself was a hostile place for Akira, RinneÅfs side was one where he could find
peace and comfort, where he was undisturbed by the darkness of any other God or
Goddess.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Rinne, finally had a purpose in life after she found someone
she wanted to protect, had sworn to save Akira from his unending miseries. She
was confident that if she tried her best, she could keep the extreme purity of
the boyÅfs soul from hurting himself. She was disabused of such na&iuml;ve notions
upon realizing that even if she remained by AkiraÅfs side days and nights, the
world would always find a way to hurt him. The older the Sword God grew, the
worse his situation became. At the age of fifteen, the R&amp;D Division of
Heaven put Akira under their twisted experiments. Those damned researchers
caught demons and ghouls and whatnots from Onogoro and forced Akira to fight
them until fatigue defeated him and knocked him unconscious. Akira always woke
up screaming in his room after that. Izanagi, always hiding in that study of
his and dreaming of his adopted daughter, cared not a jig about the fact that
every night, his youngest son cried for the vicious beasts he slain with his
own hand and the bloodthirsty demons felled by RinneÅfs edges.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Their lives took a drastic turn upon AkiraÅfs turning twenty.
Perhaps it was all those times Rinne had spent holding him tightly so he could
cry his eyes out within the curve of her arms that made her realize the one in
her embrace had grown into a handsome young man and was no longer the child
with whom she used to play hide-and-seek. Honest to the heavens, she neither
thought she would look at his smile and blush like a giddy girl in love nor
imagined that she would or moon after him days and nights. And of course, she
had had no clue as to how troublesome it was to fall in love with someone to
whom she could not hide her ever-growing feelings and her quivering heart.
Rinne ended up running away from him whenever those stupid butterflies trounced
her stomach, which meant most of the times they were together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Their, ironically, hide-and-seek game continued for another
while until the day Akira managed to corner her and inevitably discovered the
truth. She had cried like a baby then because she feared Akira would hate her.
She could not help thinking that way. It was really shameful to fall in love
with someone she had been caring for since little. It was not right to feel
that way toward someone who had been looking up to her as a respectable sister
for almost a decade. The outcome was not what she expected, however. Akira had
hugged her instead of sneering at her face in disgust. He had told Rinne that
he loved her too rather than saying that she should vanish from his sight
forever. If she recalled it correctly, she had fainted dead shortly afterwards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>From that point onward, AkiraÅfs free time was exclusively devoted
to Rinne. They would sit somewhere in the back garden of the Heavenly Palace,
gazing at the sun fleeting toward the western sky or the pretty stars sparkling
in the heavens. Once in a while, he would find some secluded spot to offer her
a quick brush on the lips. Other than that, they were satisfied with just
staying by each otherÅfs side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Then the real trouble started. Rinne should have known that
something was very wrong when Akira took her to IzanagiÅfs study. She should
have noticed that he would never go see his father, whom he rarely had the
chance to meet, with a face belong on a kid on his way to the festival. Yet,
she did not, most probably because she could barely think straight while the
Sword God was talking to her and beaming at her with that adorable smile. She
only realized the disaster thundering down their heads the moment he told the
Lord of Izumo that he would like to marry her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Despite her love for AkiraÅfs childlike innocence and his
ability to find good in almost everybody, she had to admit that he was too
na&iuml;ve at times. Even after the incident with Amaterasu-nee-sama and Tsukiyomi,
the cause of the Great Conflict between Heaven and the Underworld, Akira still
believed that the Lord of Izumo could learn to become a better man. He failed
to realize that the Ruler of Heaven, who probably did not know what the word
kindness meant, had never been a good man and probably would never be. The
Sword God had never expected to see his father explode in fury and slap him
across the face.</p>

weapon, and even if that weapon possessed a humanoid form, <i><span

of his precious son the Sword God. Probably never in his wildest dreams did
Akira imagine that the meeting with the Lord of Izumo on that fateful day
landed him into this situation, where Rinne found eternal exile from Heaven at
the end of her road. Since her lover was the pride of the Ruler of Heaven, she
never expected him to be forced to spend three thousand years in solitude and
darkness. Nor did she ever thought that they were going to be reunited in such
a fashion, where she was but a shadow of what she was... and he... a breathing
corpse who sat limply in his armchair with a face so pale and haggard one would
have thought he had been starved for days, with a pair of lightless eyes that
kept gazing out at the illusionary field of white lilies beyond the shoji doors
in front of him.</p>

ÅgAkira.Åh She ran to him. Before she could take a second step, she found the
Regent of the Underworld, who materialized out of thin air, standing between
her and the man she loved. She forced herself to stop. Despite the look of
sympathy on the older womanÅfs face, the light of determination shining in her
dark eyes told Rinne that she would surely haul her away from the Sword God
should she continue to advance. The thought of violent crossed her mind and
were immediately rejected. It was futile. Even if she had regained all her
power, she was still no match for the female Maker of the World.</p>

AkiraÅfs haggard face, to feel his warmth, to offer him comfort. Her heart ached
knowing that she could not.</p>

the Regent, who lifted a hand to gently stroke RinneÅfs head. Her voice was
racked with regret and sadness. ÅgYou... have become impure after your
involvement with the Orochi.Åh Her hand trailed down RinneÅfs forehead, face,
throat, and stopped at her left breast, beneath which her heart was throbbing
in pain. ÅgIf you touch him, you will hurt him more than he already is.Åh</p>

What the older woman said was correct. She no longer had the crystal-clear
heart Akira loved. The unstained soul in which the Sword God used to find
comfort and peace was no longer so. She bit on her underlip so hard a stream of
blood trickled down from her mouthÅfs corner. She had but forgotten that even
her <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>body</span></i> was more
than tainted with what she had done and what she was still doing in the
OrochiÅfs midst. If she touched him now, all that she could do would be
inflicting even more pain upon his already weakened body. She had succeeded in
obtaining a power that could make her dream come true in the Human World... but
in return, she had to sacrifice her purity, that which her lover treasured
most. Rinne pounded her fists on the tatami mat and let out a string of
full-throated wails.</p>

Rinne stared at the man she loved while feeling knives cutting her skin and
stakes driven through her heart. Eyes glued at the Sword GodÅfs face, she tried
to etch it into her memories. During the last three thousand years, there were
times she found herself crying uncontrollably in a corner of the Temple of the
Dragons because her deteriorating memory prevented her from recalling AkiraÅfs
noble features and because her happy moments were slowly slipping away from her
grasp. She had clung on to them desperately, for she was ever fearful of a
morning she woke up with a vague idea who a man named Ame no Murakumo was.
Although it was unlikely that such a thing would happen again now that she had
obtained a cure, she still wanted to carve as much of him into her mind as
possible. After all... she did not have much time left to live....</p>

the urgent knocks on the door woke her up with a start. As she drowsily opened
her eyes, she found her head buried in the curves of her arms, which were
placed on her drawing table, right atop a large sheet of paper. A pencil was
clutched in her right hand, an eraser in her left. She had fallen asleep while
working on her story, it would seem. Tiredly lifting her head up, she scanned
the interior of her room.</p>

placed over her window, painting the room with the color of blood. It had to be
around noon right now. Reiko winced as she let go of her drawing tools and
began to massage her temples with her fingers. Her head hurt as though she had
drunk her way to bed the night before. She only wondered how long she had been
sleeping. ReikoÅfs thought cut off abruptly when her eyes fell on the piece of
paper she had rested her head upon. Her breath caught. Not only did she draw it
again despite her effort to make herself stop, this time she also had worked
her own image into the drawing, consequently turning it into the most
disturbing thing that she had ever created. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>What

pieces. A second look at the piece of paper stayed her hand completely. She
gritted her teeth while her whole body began to tremble. There was something so
pretty about this drawing, so sweet, so heart-warming yet at the same time more
reviling than anything she had ever touched. Torn between her own feelings,
which contradicted one another point by point, she could only stand there like
a lamp post with her eyes riveted on the pencil-drawn figures on the paper. She
could not understand why she was hesitating in destroying this piece of drawing
when she had crumpled those before it with her own hands and stuffed them into
the wastebasket. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Because you
wish it to happen, and you know it,</span></i> some tiny voice answered from
the back of her head. She shivered. It <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>was</span></i>

warring feelings in her heart. She only hoped she could before she was driven
insane.</p>

clenched at her sides. This marked the hundredth time since she first decided
to refuse the Orochi Fourth Head access. To her dismay, the pop idol insisted
on coming to her room and banging on her door even though it was evident that
her presence was not what Reiko wanted. During the last couple of days, there
were times when she caught herself wondering whether locking the other girl out
was actually more troublesome than simply letting her in. Muttering darkly
under her breath about crazy and persistent girls, Reiko threw herself atop her
bed and decided to ignore the other Follower again. </p>

Head actually had a voice that was very good for singing &#8211; the song of hers

became something as pleasant as the sound of nails clawing at a blackboard when
the girl was furious. ÅgIÅfll report to the Lord that you do not care much about

exasperation and thinking that her liege lord had chosen the worst person to
relay his command, she got off the bed and walked to her door. Upon opening it,
she saw a fuming Orochi Fourth Head standing with a bent knee and hands planted
firmly on her hips. Her face could have been carved out of a storm cloud. Her
emerald eyes were blazing with anger. It had been the first time Reiko saw the
young girl looking so murderous. Her treatment toward the pop idol had struck
some sensitive nerve, no doubt.</p>

pushing her roughly back into the room and closed the door behind her once she
had stepped inside. Reiko almost jumped in panic when she heard the bolt make a
dry clicking sound as it locked into place. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>What...
is going on here?</span></i> she thought in surprise. The pushover of an Orochi
acting in such a forceful manner was not something she expected. On the same
note, neither did she ever imagine that she was growing more and more
intimidated by the light coming from the girlÅfs emerald eyes. Her legs suddenly
experienced an urgent urge to put more distance between her and the Fourth
Head. She refused to let them.</p>

was still struggling with the idea that the pushover of an Orochi she knew had
just lied in the Dark GodÅfs name, something that she should soil herself before
she even thought of doing.</p>

that she had not upon realizing how the Fourth HeadÅfs eyes had become emerald
fire that burned brilliantly in the dimly lit room. She dropped her own gaze
almost instinctively and failed to lift it up so that she could convince the
girl that she was telling the truth. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>This
is not good at all,</span></i> she told herself in alarm. She was the stronger
between them. If she wanted, she could crush the other Follower like an insect.

all hell broke loose. It was only now did she realize how true that statement
was.</p>

Reiko made one backward even though she did not want to. Her legs seemed to
have a will of their own. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅgWhy

rigidly with the tip of the pop idolÅfs nose an inch away from hers and with the
Fourth HeadÅfs hands gripping her collar. Much as she did not want to, she had
to admit that she was being scared by the dangerous gleam in the girlÅfs emerald
eyes, by her pretty face that was reddened from anger, and most of all, by the
possibility that Reiko would lose control over herself, hug the other Follower
tightly, and placed a kiss on her lips just so that she could be calmed down.</p>

Emerald eyes, tinged by sadness, regarded Reiko calmly, if a touch
exasperatedly. ÅgThatÅfs why youÅfve been avoiding me, right?Åh</p>

almost threw Reiko off-balance. She was surprised, for she knew how much those
clothes cost and how much the pop idol loved them. Quickly masking her
emotions, she searched her mind for reasons that she could use to convince the
girl that all she felt toward her was hate. Her efforts proved to be fruitful.</p>

that she could shatter the pop idolÅfs hope that they could become a couple. A
look at KoronaÅfs face told her that her words made as much impact as a drop of

the girl hurt, because she knew that should the younger girl shed even just one
drop of tear, ReikoÅfs self-restraints would be shattered into pieces. And once
that happened, she doubted she could stop herself from rushing to the pop
idolÅfs side, embracing her, comforting her, and kissing her for all she was
worth.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>Her head rang in alarm at the thought. <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Oh no!</span></i> Her eyes darted
toward the piece of paper she had left on her table just before Korona forced
her way into the room. Cold sweats poured out from her pores like water out of
a drain in a stormy day. The drawing was lying there, just several feet from
where they stood, and facing up for all eyes to see. <i><span style='font-family:
"Footlight MT Light"'>She must not see that! She must not!</span></i> Her panic
only grew in a rapid rate as she hastily searched for a way that would help her
get rid of the thing without being obvious and failed to find one. <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>I should have ripped it to shreds!</span></i>
she thought in horror and in vain. If she could, she would have done it long
since.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Another shock hit her across the face the moment she realized
that she had been looking at her drawing table for far too long, probably with
a face that shouted suspicious. To make matters far worse, Korona had noticed.
Reiko could only watch in frozen horror as the pop idol slowly turned her head toward
that which Reiko wanted her to look away from. Her heart almost exploded when
the Fourth HeadÅfs eyes widened and her mouth let out a gasp. <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>She saw it! She saw it! She saw it!
She saw it!</span></i> something raved endlessly in ReikoÅfs mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>All rational thoughts ended. Reiko lunged at the table, her
arm reaching out toward the drawing. Yet she was too late... and too hasty to
remember that with the power of an Orochi, she could destroy the flimsy piece
of paper where it sat rather than reclaim it. The thing, to her dismay, rustled
as it lifted itself into the air and ended up in KoronaÅfs hand. Reiko could
almost stamp her feet in frustration. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>You
are the biggest fool in the world, Oota Reiko! </span></i>she snarled at
herself in her head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgYou said you hated me, Reiko,Åh Korona said quietly after a
moment of studying the drawing. ÅgThen whatÅfs the meaning of this?Åh The Fourth
Head thrust the piece of paper at her with a joyous gleam in her eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>On the paper, there was something Reiko would never have
sketched in her right mind. It was a picture depicting two figures entwined in
an intimate embrace, hands clasped in hands, lips locking onto lips. One of
them was the Fourth Head of the Orochi. The other was... Reiko herself. She
began to chew on her underlip furiously. She had always known that she had a
habit of doodling when she was deeply immersed in thoughts but never in her
life had she imagined that one day such a thing would land in her into a most
grievous pinch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>It turned out that last night, just like many restless ones before
it, Reiko had sat in front of her table and thought about how pretty Korona
appeared in her eyes lately, about how much better the younger girl would look
if she would just let Reiko burn her wardrobe and buy her a new one. She knew
she should not be mooning over the pop idol, she scorned herself for it and
even went as far as slapping herself a few times, yet she could not help but
realize that she had come to like the other girl a lot, and that maybe she had
fallen in love with the Fourth Head despite her reluctance.&nbsp; All the
while, she had never noticed that her hand was grabbing a pencil and that it
was dancing over a piece of paper even though she was looking straight ahead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgWhy are you keeping silent?Åh Korona asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

really knowing how to answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Suddenly, the pop idol walked toward the trash can that was
filled to the brim with crumpled pieces paper. She pulled them out and
proceeded to flatten them over the floor one by one. Once she had emptied the
can, she burst into tears. Although Reiko had known exactly what the girl would
find there, she did not even consider stopping her. It was pointless. After
all, the sketch in which the two of them were kissing was by far worse than the
rest combined. After all, now that Korona had learned of ReikoÅfs feelings
toward her, all these other sketches &#8211; the sole subject of which was the
younger girl, dressed in all kinds of clothes Reiko thought would look good on
her, all created in the same situation as the first &#8211; were but insignificant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Thoughts fled her mind altogether when she realized that
Korona, who had crossed the distance separating them without her noticing, was
standing right less than an inch away. The girlÅfs face, pretty and soaked with
tears, was painted with so much love that she could not help but want to kiss
her, Before she knew what was happening, the Fourth Head had already thrown her
arms around her neck and pressed her lips onto hers. Shocked, Reiko tried to
push the pop idol away. It was strange how even when her hands were grabbing at
KoronaÅfs shoulders, they were pulling her in even closer instead of doing the
opposite. So the kiss deepened, so their lips could not seem to part, and so
all hell broke loose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;Once again, ReikoÅfs back hit the wall under KoronaÅfs
advance. This time, the impact was strong enough to knock down a picture case
atop a small table nearby. The case, made entirely from glass, broke into a
million pieces upon crashing upon the wooden floor. Its shattering sound took
both Reiko and KoronaÅfs attention, thus halting the dance of their tongues and
lips. Horrified, she saw that lying amidst the fragments was a picture of her
and her deceased girlfriend, Natsune. A firestorm, emerging from deep within
her heart, spread across her body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

had brutally pushed the Fourth Head off of her, she twisted her wrist and swung
the Ice Blade<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'> </span></i>in a
wide arc. The door sprang open at the same time that an icy wind rose around
Korona before it proceeded to mercilessly bind her hands and feet. At ReikoÅfs
command, the girl was tossed out the room in an instant. The door then swung back
into place, robbing her of the sight of the pop idol, someone she loved yet at
the same time did not want to love.</p>

closer to her heart. Tears trickled down the corners of her eyes. She did not
know that she could still shed them. She had thought that she had dried them
all when her lover departed from this world five years ago and left her living
with no purpose other than vengeance. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>I

Seal he cast on his room when he heard KoronaÅfs loud, anguished voice echoing
in from the far end of the spacious hallway, where he knew the quarters of Oota
Reiko the Fifth Head were located. Tokiya shook his head in amusement. Those
two had been making a lot of noises lately and in his humble opinion, unless
they sorted things out, the Temple of the Dragons would probably never have a
momentÅfs peace. He could not seem to comprehend why they were still having
problems, in any case. Even a blind man could see that both of them were madly
in love. Another couple would have gotten together and bedded each other long
since.</p>

his own room. He walked in... and felt as though he had been dropped into a
hole that he did not know existed. It happened so abruptly and ended in an
equally abrupt manner that before Tokiya could act, he had already fallen
headfirst into a waist-deep pond, splashing water everywhere. The cold
immediately seeped through his clothes as though they were made of paper and
began to sting against every inch of his skin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

and his suit proved to be quite troublesome in the water &#8211; Tokiya managed to
swim to a shallower place in the pond and get back on his feet. Brushing his
wet hair off of his face, he turned his head and scanned the vicinity. He was
currently somewhere in a forest, he believed, for he was surrounded by green
trees that towered over the ground and spread their cool shades under the noon
sun on high. Further away, according to his enhanced Orochi eyes, rose the
tiled roofs of Shingetsu Grand Shrine. He could the stench of MahorobaÅfs
spiritual stronghold rankling in his nose. He could hear the prayers of its
inhabitants droning irritatingly in his ears. He could feel its sanctity
cutting into his flesh. His Orochi instincts immediately beckoned him to draw
out his Sealed Sword and proceed to lay waste upon the last hiding place that
the Priestess of the Sun had.</p>

standing at the edge of the pond and smiling at him in a way that would have
halted any other manÅfs heart. Even when she looked murderously cold, she was
easily one of the most beautiful girls he had ever laid eyes upon.
Instinctively he reached into his coat pocket and searched for that which he
had been carrying with him as a measure of protection. He almost heaved a sigh
of relief. It was still there. He invoked a tiny bit of his powers and sent it
into the little object. Now, if he could manage to stay alive for the next few
minutes, everything would be okay.</p>

very well how she had empty-handedly defeated him and his Aneki at the same
time, taken their weapons away from them with contemptuous ease, destroyed the
Sealed Swords without even lifting a hand, and very nearly sent them to the
Afterlife in the process. The traitor Seventh Head should be thanking the

innocent expression. Yet, Tokiya knew better than that, for he had been looking
into her eyes from the very start. Those sapphire gems only harbored murderous
intentions.</p>

lucky as the Seventh Head. ÅgHowever strong you are, you still have limits.

an empty glade surrounded by trees that were dominated by the tiled roofs of
Shingetsu Grand Shrine in the distance. He blinked. There was a large pond
several feet away from him, upon the surface of which a corpse floated, its
front facing the cerulean sky. It was a man whose clothes were blackened and
tattered as though struck by lightning. It was the man whom Tsubasa betrayed to
his death. It was the Third Head, Girochi Tokiya. Chills ran down TsubasaÅfs

behind, face so determined that the scaredy cat impression Yui always had about

blame him for feeling that way, though. His plan was going well. The man had to
be thinking that it was but a matter of time until he achieved that which he
wanted most. Only that <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>nothing</span></i>

the other hand, obviously, thought differently as he casually picked up the

R&amp;D Division wrote it. It was simply a concise user manual of the Eyes of
Heaven that told the Priestesses all they needed to know about their weapons
before they launched an attack on the Orochi forces. Yui didnÅft really what the

She never faltered even when Oogami Kazuki narrowed his eyes at her for
refusing to address the Priestess of the Moon with what he had been trying to
make her. Yui thought the man should just give up. The golden-haired girl never
believed for even a split second that Himemiya Chikane was dead. It was a waste

text-indent:.5in'>Tsukazaki Fuyura, swathed in a white cloak with a deep hood
that hid her entire face, found herself muttering under her breath when her
companion, Kami no Mikoto of the Three Arbiters, threw yet another seductive
glance at her over her shoulder while walking along the spacious hallways of
the Heavenly Palace. The woman had never stopped making advances on Fuyura
since the moment they first met despite being met with indifference. Fuyura was
fairly certain that the woman thought that if she threw enough glances, Fuyura
would agree to be her lover. Shame was one thing amongst many that Kami no
Mikoto did not have. Five minutes after they were introduced to each other,
courtesy of Ame no Minaka, another lecherous man who refused to act his age,
the woman had made it clear to Fuyura in a secretive, roundabout way that she
did not intend to let her go without bedding her first.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgWe have arrived, Tsukazaki-dono,Åh said the Arbiter, who had
stopped in front of a room that was guarded by two Holy Messengers in white
capes. The men, Fuyura had heard that there was not a single woman employed by
the Division because Izanagi feared that his employees would be distracted,
seemed to be carved from stone the way they simply gazed ahead and pretended
that no others existed.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgAs you wish.Åh Kami no Mikoto gave an incline of her head
then spoiled it by flashing a lewd smile at Fuyura before she turned to face
the Holy Messengers. Her visage hardened and her eyes grew cold as she drew
herself up just so she could look the men in the face. The woman, despite being
rather short, was obviously trying to impress Fuyura. It did not work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

Mikoto of the Arbiters, wish to speak with the Goddess of the Moon.Åh She put
the back of her right hand in front of the Messengers and let them see that on
her middle finger was a gold signet ring that bore the shield and the sword
insignia of the Celestial Assembly. ÅgListen and obey.Åh </p>

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgAs you command, Arbiter,Åh replied the men in unison, their
voices betraying the surprise and the fear that they were feeling inside. With
great alacrity, they opened the shoji doors to reveal a chamber completely
immersed in darkness. Afterwards, they quietly stood on either side of the
entrance in a way that reminded Fuyura of people who caused mischief and were
caught red-handed. It would appear to her that somehow, they feared the Arbiter
more than they would their liege lord.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgPlease take your time, Tsukazaki-dono,Åh Kami no Mikoto
whispered into FuyuraÅfs ear. From the way the woman slowly drew her face very
slowly away afterwards, Fuyura was under the impression that had she not been
glaring at the Arbiter coldly, she would have been kissed. Her mouth tightened
at the thought. According to the information that the I.S.R. agents had
gathered on the Three Arbiters, Kami no Mikoto had already had a secret lover
who worshipped her like a mortal would a Goddess. The reason why the woman kept
hitting on Fuyura despite that fact was beyond her.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgVery well,Åh Fuyura answered curtly and proceeded into the
dark chamber, faintly hearing the Arbiter commanding the two Messengers to
report to the Sanctum Core without delay. But of course, she thought, they
cannot let this reach IzanagiÅfs ears. When the two guards returned to this
room, they would have already <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>forgotten</span></i>
that someone had come to speak with the Goddess of the Moon. <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>The Lord of Izumo would choke himself
to death the moment he discovered what his subordinates had been using his
precious Core for,</span></i> she thought and chuckled before a movement of her
hand closed the shoji doors behind her and once again drowned the chamber in
pitch darkness. Another gesture formed a small sphere of light that brought
illumination to the furthest corners. Near one of them there was a bed, atop
which lay the Goddess of the Moon. Tsukiyomi, who was praised as the second
most beautiful woman in the Three Worlds, was on her stomach with the side of
her face pressed against the mattress and with her hands clutching the bed
linen. Her silver eyes were swollen, her cheeks wet. If Tsukiyomi had not been
crying continuously during the last twenty-four hours, Fuyura would leave
immediately and tell Kami no Mikoto that she loved her.</p>

the information that a high officer of the Underworld was currently in the Holy
City, where any resident of Reiha was viewed as a foe, before she spoke up,

could only assume that the Moon Goddess was only trying to be polite.</p>

expression changed a hair afterwards, though. She still seemed as lifeless as
the first moment Fuyura had laid eyes on her.</p>

became so sick that the Regent was afraid that she was going to die. Right now,

continued. ÅgHaving more than one boyfriend at a time is quite tiring, I assure

to her, knelt at her feet, and begged to be her lover. She never turned anyone
down, for the record, but she dumped them the following day more often than
not. In a way, she was much worse than the Arbiter. Fuyura had been at least
half-serious when she told Amaterasu that she wanted her to introduce Susanou

text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Alone in
her mentorÅfs study, Aoi could only stand where she did before the Goddess left
and feel dumb-founded. Although being vaguely aware that she was the subject of
a joke this time, she failed to understand its meaning. Besides, she had not
expected to hear one from Tsukiyomi-sama, who always frowned at her in a
disapproving manner whenever she caught her teasing the Sun Priestess. The
Goddess of the Moon had made it clear to Aoi on numerous occasions that since
such behaviors reminded her of someone she did not wish to think of, Aoi should
just stop. Needless to say, she never did. In the end, Tsukiyomi-sama was so
tired of saying the same thing over and over again that she stopped doing that
altogether. Little Akari had been most displeased at her mentorÅfs failure in
putting Aoi in her place.</span></i></p>

puzzled, Aoi walked out of the study and headed straight toward her childhood
friendÅfs room. Her whole body grew lighter with every step she took. Her heart
beat faster every time the little angelÅfs face popped up in her mind. Her mouth

smile without her meaning it to. By the time she arrived at her destination,
Aoi almost floated in the air while her chest was aching from the racing
pulses. </span></i>It had been too long, Akari,<i><span style='font-family:

grimaced. It was quite disturbing to know that they were open, like usual,
because Akari never remembered to keep them shut. The little angelÅfs
carelessness had been what fanned the flame of disaster feeding on her innate
and incurable clumsiness. Half of the times that the golden-haired girl fell
flat on her face were because she tripped on the hem of her own hibakama, for
goodnessÅfs sake.</span></i></p>

Priestess of the Sun was nowhere in sight in the spacious yet simple room
furnished with only a kotatsu table and a screen for changing clothes. In a
corner, her futon lay neatly folded, her white yukata still hung across the
lonely screen that stood atop the empty tatami floor.</span></i></p>

she stepped inside, her nose immediately caught the scent of the golden-haired
girl, which was suffusing the air she breathed and invading every corner of her
lungs. It was too faint to be noticed by any other person, yet to Aoi, who had
held her childhood friend and sweetheart in her arms anytime she could, it was
little less obvious than holding a bouquet right under her nose. The Priestess
of the Sun, regardless of the time of day, always smelled as though she just
stepped out from the bath, fresh, crisply fragrant, and mysteriously
mesmerizing. Truth be told, Aoi might as well have gulped down a glassful of
wine every time she hugged the girl, or was hugged. And when Akari kissed her,
she could barely keep herself from going crazy.</span></i></p>

reaching the center of the room, she noticed that the second shoji door, which
stood behind the changing screen, was also open, revealing a stone-paved path
that lead to the back garden of the Lunar Shrine. Knowing that her sweetheart
could be no where else, she crossed the tatami floor and treaded on that path
while wondering what the Priestess of the Sun was doing in the garden when she
should be sleeping in bed. The answer to that question left her mouth hanging
and her heart racing at the speed of light.</span></i></p>

and in the awe that had her spellbound, Aoi stood like a lamp post near a small
stone-paved square that was surrounded on all sides by a great field of golden
lilies that the Priestess of the Sun had planted with her own hand during the
last ten years of her life. They were the breed of flower that could be found
nowhere else in the Three Worlds, for they were created in the laboratories of
IzumoÅfs R&amp;D Division. Although the researchers scared Aoi silly every time
they looked at her, she had to give credit when credit was due. Those Immortals
in white robes and glasses had made her childhood friend very happy when they
gave her the seeds of the golden lilies. The petals of those flowers,
glittering in sunlight like the precious metal yet smooth as silk under oneÅfs
touch, never withered and never died as they bloomed year-round, out of time
and unrestricted by the revolving seasons. Yet, wonderful they might be, right
now they appeared but insignificant compared to the breathtaking scenery that
was happening in their midst. Upon the small square at the end of the walkway
danced AoiÅfs beautiful counterpart, the Priestess of the Sun.</span></i></p>

movements the little angel performed, let alone catch up. The last time they
visited the Holy City, Aoi had had the chance to lay eyes upon HeavenÅfs most
talented dancers, who were able to steal the breath of audiences as though
taking things from their own pockets. Yet for all the grace those Goddesses
possessed, for all the impressive stunts they pulled, they were but children
wiggling their hands and feet beside AoiÅfs sweetheart. It was rather ironic
that Akari could do such a thing when a few days ago she nearly stabbed herself
in the foot during sword practice. Aoi smiled.</span></i></p>

continued to watch her childhood friend glide back and forth across the
stone-paved square. Her eyes were glued to the little angelÅfs slender figure.
Her heart leapt every time AkariÅfs gorgeous body made a graceful turn. Her
amazement, as well as her puzzlement, grew as she noticed a string of golden
light that extended from each of the other girlÅfs fingers and rose upward into
the night sky. As AoiÅfs eyes traced the path of those strings, she found out
that they were merging into an almost complete kimono. It was then did she
realize that her childhood friend was not dancing. The girl was weaving a dress
with the golden strings made from her own power. Her flowing movements, in
fact, were what put the strings into place.</span></i></p>

herself that the little angel could just do this with a needle and normal
threads, she held her hand over her mouth and laughed softly enough not to be
heard. Her laughter died, her face heated up, and her throat ran dry, however,
the moment she caught sight of four Kanji characters on the breast of the
kimono. Surrounded by patterns of moons and stars and hollyhock flowers, the
character spelled Kannazuki Aoi, which was her full name. </span></i>She made
it for me!<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'> she thought,
feeling her blood turning into wine. A look at the little angelÅfs face
confirmed her suspicion. Kannazuki Akari, her feet flowing from one stance to
another while her fingers continued to release the golden strings, was looking
at her unfinished kimono with the same expression that she always had before
she placed a kiss on AoiÅfs lips.</span></i></p>

breaking loose. The little angel never noticed that golden light was rolling
off of her in waves and filling the atmosphere of the Moon with illumination
and heat. The stars in the heavens were quickly erased from sight. The night
vanished. The air became violent as the winds, sharp and cold, rose to form a
fierce current howling around AoiÅfs sweetheart. When a gust of chilling air
swept across her face and made her feel as though she had just been cut, she
let out a small cry before she could stop herself.</span></i></p>

strike. The winds, no longer having anything to hold them back, exploded into a
powerful hurricane that caught the little angel in its clutches and hurled her
into the sky. </span></i></p>

though the hurricane, and neutralized the currents in its wake. As the air grew
calm once more, AoiÅfs little angel, whose body was wrapped in a large cloth of
silver light that Aoi had woven and cast shortly after she cut through the
winds, descended safely onto her arms. With that, coherent thoughts took wings
and fled her mind altogether. She would be very surprised if they did not.
After all, in her embrace was a girl with a body so light and soft that she
would shame the best cushion in the world, with a face so beautiful she would
make a flower wither with envy, and with a fragrance that smelled so good no
perfume could ever hope to best. Aoi only wished that she could hold her

aware of the outcome the moment she opened her mouth and pleaded. She had never
been confident she could persuade a kind-hearted person like her childhood
friend to leave the Human World to its own device. Still, Aoi had tried to lie
to herself that somehow Akari would agree, tried to convince herself that she
would outweigh the world in her girlfriendÅfs heart. She was such a fool.</span></i></p>

asked herself absently. Definitely, for tears was trickling down her cheeks.

she tasted was bitterness. ÅgI did not need immortality, either. IÅfd only like
to have a little house, probably on a green hill or near to the ocean, where
the two of us would spend the rest of our time by each otherÅfs sideÅh It was
strange how her voice sounded just like someone elseÅfs the way it grew emptier,
smaller, and more distant with every word. ÅgI want to cook for you everyday...

her body being shaken, but only very dimly. Paying it no more attention, she
continued to pursue the thoughts in her head, ÅgI have always known you look up
to Tsukiyomi-sama and was grateful to her for having raised the two of us.Åh
Although her mouth was moving without her meaning it to, her ears did not pick
up a word. ÅgI have always known you would love to have a child. While I cannot
give you one of my own flesh and blood, I did think of a way. Probably when we
get older, when our life has become more stable, we would try to adopt....
Maybe from one of those orphanages, where those poor children are abandoned. I
figure it would be rather awkward if the people there asked why two women would
do something like that.... I guess we are spared the trouble of having to cook
up a believable answer now. I wonder if it is too foolish of me to plan my life
without knowing how our lives would end and what destiny has in store for
us....Åh</span></i></p>

a kiss that would probably melt all the ice in the Human World.</span></i></p>

she knew her dearest wish had already been granted. That night, she spent
sleeping peacefully in AkariÅfs room, on the futon that was soaked with her
scent, cuddled tightly in her loving embrace. For the first time in many
months, Aoi had a dream without blood, swords and the frightening vision of the
future.</span></i></p>

Original Priestess of the Sun had said. The girl never meant to run away with

doubt she had been scheming in her head all the while. AoiÅfs counterpart had
