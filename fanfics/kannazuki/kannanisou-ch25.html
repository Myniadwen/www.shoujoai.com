----------

Before performing the Last Rite and leaving the world behind, Himeko and 
Chikane wanted to spend some time alone. They decided to spend their 
last moments of life in the place that they had first met, the flower 
garden. Somehow, it was the only place on the entire planet that had 
been spared from Orochi&#39;s destruction.

Himeko and Chikane stood before Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi as they prepared 
to part. &quot;Thank you Tsukuyomi for everything you&#39;ve done,&quot; said Chikane. 
&quot;I wish that there was some way that I could repay you.&quot;

&quot;It was an honor simply to serve and protect the Lunar Priestess,&quot; 
Tsukuyomi&#39;s deep voice came from the purple mech. &quot;If I could give up my 
life to spare yours, I would do it.&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Chikane said. &quot;Once the world is restored, you have to 
return to the moon to make sure it doesn&#39;t fall from the sky.&quot;

&quot;And thank you, Amaterasu,&quot; Himeko said. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t be together with 
Chikane again if it weren&#39;t for you.&quot;

&quot;Your ancestors worshipped me,&quot; said Amaterasu, her voice more musical 
and high-pitched than Tsukuyomi&#39;s. &quot;The only way to return my debt to 
Queen Himiko and the priestesses that succeeded her was to do what I 
could to protect you. And I would sacrifice myself for you just as my 
sister would for the Lunar Priestess.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; said Himeko. The two celestial gods kneeled before the 
Priestesses one last time before disappearing.

Alone, Himeko and Chikane looked at each other. &quot;I guess it&#39;s time,&quot; 
said Himeko.

&quot;Himeko, wait,&quot; said Chikane. Himeko looked at Chikane, waiting to 
listen to what her beloved had to say. Chikane said, &quot;Last year, I did a 
terrible thing to you. And even though I know that I was under the 
influence of Orochi when it happened, I could never forgive myself if I 
died without atoning for my sin.&quot; Chikane produced her sheathed tanto 
and held it out in front of her, presenting it to Himeko. Himeko looked 
at the tanto in Chikane&#39;s hands, curious as to what the taller girl 
intended. &quot;Take it, Himeko,&quot; said Chikane. Himeko did as Chikane told 
her and took the blade from Chikane.

Chikane stepped back and started untying the obi that she wore as part 
of her Priestess uniform. &quot;The only way that I can atone for what I have 
done,&quot; Chikane said, the purple obi falling to the ground, &quot;is to let 
you do what I did to you.&quot; Chikane grabbed the sides of her kimono and 
pulled it away from her body. She let the sleeves slip off of her 
shoulders and down her arms, revealing her bare upper body. &quot;Rape me, 
Himeko. Steal my virginity away from me.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re...virginity?&quot; Himeko asked in a very shaky, nervous voice.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Chikane explained. &quot;I would never allow anyone but you to touch 
me down there...not even myself. My virgin blood is for you and you 
alone.&quot; Chikane dropped her pants, lied down on the ground, and splayed 
herself out, displaying her naked body to Himeko. &quot;Now Himeko, rape me. 
Even if I am in pain, even if I scream for you to stop, you must not, 
not until you have had your way with me, not until you have satisfied 
your lust, not until you have taken my virginity like I have taken 
yours.&quot;

Himeko stared at the girl displaying herself before her. She did not 
know what to make of the situation. Himeko knew that Chikane wanted to 
atone for what happened the year before, but Himeko was very unsettled 
to see Chikane in such an absolutely subordinate position. Chikane had 
always been a strong, gentle person, and now she was presenting herself 
as no more than an object for Himeko&#39;s enjoyment, a living sex doll. 
&quot;Please,&quot; Chikane begged.

Himeko looked at the tanto in her hand and then looked back at Chikane. 
Himeko clenched her fists and said, &quot;No.&quot; Chikane looked at Himeko in 
surprise. &quot;I can&#39;t do that to you, Chikane,&quot; Himeko continued. &quot;This is 
not the way I want to consummate our love.&quot; Himeko untied the obi around 
her waist and started undressing as well. &quot;If you&#39;re going to lose your 
virginity,&quot; said Himeko as she dropped her pants, exposing her naked 
self to Chikane, &quot;then it&#39;s going to be consensual. I will lose my 
virginity with you.&quot;

&quot;What...?&quot; said a surprised Chikane.

&quot;I was remade along with the rest of the world last year,&quot; said Himeko. 
&quot;In this reality, I&#39;m still a virgin.&quot; Himeko knelt down in front of 
Chikane, still holding the sheathed tanto in her hand. &quot;I don&#39;t want to 
rape you, Chikane. What I want is to make love to you, to make love WITH 
you, to be together with you in mind and soul AS WELL as in body. Isn&#39;t 
that what you want, Chikane?&quot;

&quot;What I want is irrelevant.&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s not!&quot; Himeko wrapped her arms around Chikane and pulled her 
close. &quot;You matter to me more than anyone else in the world, Chikane,&quot; 
Himeko said, tears forming in the corners of her eyes. &quot;We&#39;ve both 
suffered far too much because of Orochi, both emotionally and 
physically.&quot; Himeko touched the side of Chikane&#39;s left arm, the place 
where it had been severed by Ame no Murakumo, where a scar that 
strangely resembled a flower had formed.

&quot;Raping you would only cause you more suffering,&quot; the shorter girl 
continued. &quot;I want to lose my virginity to you the right way this time, 
no rape involved.&quot; Himeko pulled away from Chikane just enough so that 
she could look into her beloved&#39;s eyes. &quot;I know that I pulled back the 
first time you wanted to make love to me after you were freed from the 
Lunar Shrine. But after we climbed the mountain and I had to give you my 
heat, I felt warm and comforted knowing that my skin was touching yours. 
And when we got back home after reviving Ame no Murakumo and we slept 
only in our underwear, I got the same feeling when my skin touched 
yours.&quot; Tears of happiness came to Himeko&#39;s eyes as her heart bled all 
of her emotions to her love. &quot;Chikane,&quot; she continued, &quot;I&#39;m ready now. 
The memories of that night no longer bother me. I&#39;m happy that the world 
was remade. Because now, I can give up my virginity willingly. I love 
you, Chikane. And I am not going to taint that love with the evil that 
was caused at the hands of the Orochi.&quot;

Chikane tried to hold back the tears that were threatening to burst 
forth from her eyes. However, as hard as she tried, she could not hold 
back her emotions. She embraced Himeko tighter than she had ever 
embraced anything and buried her face into Himeko&#39;s bosom, all of the 
pain and suffering that she had pent up pouring out of her. &quot;Oh, 
Himeko...&quot; she cried.

&quot;Let&#39;s become one, Chikane.&quot; Tears still streaming from their eyes, the 
two girls wrapped their arms around each other and kissed passionately. 
This time, Himeko did not resist when she felt Chikane&#39;s hands on her 
breasts. And in the very same place that their love had blossomed, 
Himeko and Chikane consummated that love, both willingly and tenderly.

----------

As Chikane awoke, she felt her body wrapped in something soft, smooth, 
and warm. She opened her eyes and saw the face of Himeko, sleeping 
peacefully in her arms. Chikane smiled as she set eyes upon her beloved 
Himeko. The feeling of Himeko&#39;s soft warmth wrapped around her made 
Chikane feel so relaxed. She closed her eyes again and snuggled up to 
Himeko.

Suddenly, Chikane&#39;s eyes shot wide open. Something about the environment 
was not right. First, Himeko&#39;s face was illuminated with a bright light 
like the sun. Second, Chikane heard birds singing. Chikane jumped to a 
sitting position, suddenly awake and alert. She looked around herself, 
finding that the sky was as blue as ever and that birds were singing 
happily in the tree that sat in the middle of the flower garden that 
Himeko and Chikane were in.

&quot;Himeko...&quot; Chikane said, softly at first. &quot;Himeko,&quot; she said, a little 
louder.

Himeko murmured at hearing Chikane speak. &quot;Chikane...?&quot; she said 
sleepily, opening her eyes just a crack.

&quot;Himeko,&quot; Chikane said, &quot;look around.&quot;

Himeko&#39;s eyes opened a bit more, just enough to take in her 
surroundings. Himeko&#39;s eyes then shot open as she saw the blue sky and 
the birds chirping. She knew that the rose garden had miraculously 
survived the devastation that Orochi had caused, but it now seemed that 
everything else had been restored as well! It was as if nothing had 
changed since the Orochi&#39;s initial attack. &quot;This...is a dream...?&quot; 
Himeko asked.

&quot;It&#39;s too real to be a dream,&quot; said Chikane.

&quot;An illusion?&quot; Himeko suggested. &quot;A fake world created by Orochi&#39;s 
power?&quot;

&quot;We defeated Orochi. Himeko, I don&#39;t know how, but I think the world has 
been restored.&quot;

&quot;But how? We never performed the Last Rite. Ame no Murakumo and Susanou 
said that the blood of a Priestess must be spilled.&quot;

There was a pause. Chikane had a revelation. &quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; she said. &quot;I 
understand now.&quot; Chikane turned to Himeko, the warmest smile on her 
face. &quot;The blood of a Priestess HAS been spilled.&quot;

Himeko thought for a moment, trying to understand what Chikane was 
saying. Himeko gasped when she realized what her girlfriend was talking 
about. She looked down at the ground to find Chikane&#39;s tanto, still 
sheathed, with two spots of blood on it, one at either end. She looked 
back to Chikane and cried, &quot;Our virgin blood?&quot;

&quot;The purest blood that a person can give. Blood spilled not by a blade 
but by our love for each other. It was our pure, undying love that 
rebuilt the world.&quot; Chikane looked to the sky and said, &quot;The sun is 
shining so brightly. Our love was powerful enough to restore the 
heavenly balance as well.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Chikane!&quot; Himeko dove into Chikane&#39;s arms and the two girls 
embraced one another, tears of joy forming in the corners of their eyes. 
&quot;I can&#39;t believe it,&quot; Himeko cried. &quot;It&#39;s really true. We&#39;re really 
here!&quot;

&quot;Yes, Himeko,&quot; cooed Chikane. &quot;We&#39;re really here.&quot;

Himeko looked into Chikane&#39;s eyes and said, &quot;I&#39;m so happy.&quot;

Then, the surprise returned to Chikane&#39;s face. &quot;Himeko,&quot; she said.

&quot;What is it Chikane?&quot; Himeko asked. Himeko noticed that Chikane&#39;s gaze 
was directed at Himeko&#39;s chest. Himeko looked down to find that the 
Solar Mark had disappeared. Himeko and Chikane looked back at the ground 
to find that their Priestess uniforms and the Priestess Blades had 
disappeared as well! Himeko looked back at Chikane and said with urgency 
in her voice, &quot;Chikane, turn around.&quot; Chikane quickly turned her back to 
Himeko and pulled her hair out of the way, revealing her back to Himeko. 
Sure enough, the Lunar Mark had also disappeared. &quot;The Lunar Mark is 
gone also,&quot; Himeko said. &quot;What does that mean?&quot;

&quot;The month of Kannazuki has ended. Our mission is over. We defeated 
Orochi, we rebuilt the world, that means that we are no longer Kannazuki 
no Miko.&quot;

&quot;You mean...?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Chikane turned back to Himeko, the tears now flowing freely. 
&quot;We&#39;re no longer Priestesses. I&#39;m not the Lunar Priestess, and you&#39;re 
not the Solar Priestess. We are simply Chikane Himemiya and Himeko 
Kurusugawa, two ordinary high school girls. It&#39;s over, Himeko. Now we 
can live our lives like normal girls, just like weve always wanted.&quot;

Neither Himeko nor Chikane could hold back their emotions. Their hearts 
were filled with so much joy that they both completely broke down in 
each other&#39;s arms, crying so hard that it was hard to believe that 
nobody heard them. Even if they had been heard, they didn&#39;t care. It no 
longer mattered to them if people knew that they were girls in love. All 
that mattered was that they WERE girls in love. And if even the whole 
world knew of their love, that would be okay.

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; they heard a teenaged female say from behind the rose 
bushes. &quot;Is someone back there?&quot;

Himeko and Chikane then heard the rose bushes rustling. &quot;What are you 
doing, Miss Izumi?&quot; another female voice said. &quot;You know that students 
aren&#39;t allowed in there.&quot;

&#39;Izumi?&#39; Himeko thought. It had to be the Trio from Class 1A, the group 
of three girls that had bullied Himeko the year before. She then 
remembered the other girl&#39;s voice as that of Kyoko.

&quot;I know I heard Miya-Sama&#39;s voice,&quot; said Izumi. &quot;I haven&#39;t seen her all 
day. She has to be there!&quot;

&quot;Miya-Sama wouldn&#39;t be in such a place,&quot; Himeko heard Misaki say. 
&quot;Someone like Miya-Sama wouldn&#39;t disobey the school rules.&quot;

Just then, Izumi, Kyoko, and Misaki all poked their heads out from the 
rose bushes. What they found was the one thing that they had least 
expected, the school&#39;s beloved Miya-Sama with Himeko Kurusugawa, both of 
them completely naked in the rose garden.

&quot;Well, if it isn&#39;t the Trio,&quot; said Chikane.

&quot;Miya-Sama...? And Miss Kurusugawa...?&quot; Izumi stammered.

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; said Himeko nonchalantly. &quot;Chikane and I are in love.&quot;

&quot;This...&quot; Kyoko stammered, &quot;This has to be a dream.&quot;

&quot;A nightmare!&quot; cried Misaki. &quot;Miya-Sama would never do something so 
disgusting!&quot;

Chikane aimed her left arm directly at the Trio. The scar started 
glowing blue and the slender limb transformed into a large, silver arm, 
five times the length of a normal arm! The three girls trembled as the 
blade on the arm&#39;s wrist pointed centimeters from their faces. &quot;If you 
have a problem with my relationship with Miss Kurusugawa,&quot; Chikane spat, 
&quot;you&#39;ll have to deal with me!&quot; Izumi, Kyoko, and Misaki moved back 
several centimeters and then ran straight out of the rose garden, 
screaming in terror.

&quot;Chikane?&quot; Himeko asked. &quot;What is that?&quot;

Chikane then looked at the giant silver arm and said, &quot;Somehow, it seems 
that some of Ame no Murakumo&#39;s power transferred to me when I stole her 
arm. All of the power that was stored in that arm was shunted into my 
body. I wonder...&quot; Chikane raised the arm and called out, &quot;Murakumo!&quot; 
Suddenly, Chikane&#39;s entire body transformed. Her body increased to five 
times its normal size and was covered in a suit of silver armor. The 
armor was definitely the outer hull of Ame no Murakumo, but it was 
slightly different, more smooth and slender than a mech, much more 
humanoid than the Ame no Murakumo that Himeko and Chikane knew. And even 
though the creature that had appeared had the same glowing green eyes 
that Ame no Murakumo had, in place of its mouth plate was a human face, 
Chikane&#39;s face!

&quot;Chikane, is that you?&quot; Himeko asked, looking at the giant before her.

Chikane smiled. She picked up Himeko in her giant arms and said, &quot;Let&#39;s 
go, Himeko.&quot; Chikane jumped high into the air and soared over the land 
with Himeko in her arms.

Himeko and Chikane smiled at each other. Himeko raised her arms and 
cried out in glee, feeling the wind on her face, feeling completely free 
with Chikane carrying her through the eternal sky.

----------

As Himeko and Chikane returned to the Himemiya estate, they landed on 
the small balcony just outside Chikane&#39;s bedroom, the old bedroom that 
she had used before the Orochi attacked on her 16th birthday. It seemed 
that everything, even things from before the alternate reality was 
created, had been restored. Chikane was the daughter of the wealthy 
Takeshi Himemiya, as well as beloved idol of Ototachibana Academy and of 
the entire town.

As Murakumo landed, the silver armor dissipated, leaving Himeko and 
Chikane standing alone on the balcony. Himeko saw that the glowing scar 
on Chikane&#39;s arm. &quot;Chikane,&quot; said Himeko, &quot;that scar is still there.&quot;

&quot;Some of Ame no Murakumo&#39;s power transferred to me when I took her arm,&quot; 
said Chikane. &quot;Ame no Murakumo was stripped of her spirit when she was 
destroyed by Susanou, but all of the power that was in that arm has 
transferred to me.&quot; Chikane then smiled and said, &quot;It&#39;s still a good 
thing that there is something in this world that was born of Ame no 
Murakumo. What would become of Japan without its Imperial Regalia?&quot;

Himeko and Chikane laughed and then walked into Chikane&#39;s large room. 
Because neither of them had any spare clothes when the world was 
restored, Himeko had to wear Chikane&#39;s clothes before she went back to 
her dormitory. The clothes were a little large for her around the chest 
area, but they were just small enough for her to pull off.

As they exited Chikane&#39;s room, they found Otoha standing in front of 
them. &quot;Good afternoon, Misses,&quot; said the maid with a happy smile on her 
face.

&quot;Otoha,&quot; said Chikane. &quot;Hello.&quot;

&quot;How are you feeling?&quot; Otoha asked.

&quot;Just fine,&quot; Chikane replied.

&quot;And you, Himeko?&quot; asked Otoha, turning to the short girl beside 
Chikane.

&#39;&quot;Himeko&quot;?&#39; the blonde thought in surprise. &#39;Otoha only called me 
&quot;Himeko&quot; after we had become friends in the alternate reality.&#39;

&quot;You remember what happened...&quot; Himeko said.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure how,&quot; said Otoha, &quot;but I remember everything that 
happened, in both that other reality and this one. That means that you 
don&#39;t have to worry about me trying to take out my frustration on you, 
Himeko.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Otoha&quot; Himeko said, hugging the maid.

&quot;Are my parents home?&quot; Chikane asked.

&quot;Yes,&quot; said Otoha. &quot;They seemed quite surprised when they realized that 
they had remembered everything that happened as well.&quot;

&quot;I guess that our blood didn&#39;t restore everything,&quot; said Chikane. &quot;I 
still have that mark on my arm, Himeko and I have retained all of our 
memories of what had happened, and everyone involved has their memories 
intact.&quot;

&quot;I wonder why that is,&quot; said Otoha.

&quot;It&#39;s probably because we needed to use some of our power to keep the 
moon from falling and the sun from burning out,&quot; Himeko said. &quot;We 
couldnt use up all of our power on returning everything back to normal.

Chikane then turned to Himeko and said, &quot;But I think it&#39;s better this 
way. If EVERYTHING had returned to normal, I would probably still be 
hiding my true feelings from you, and you would probably be in a 
less-than-fulfilling relationship with Ogami right now.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right, Chikane,&quot; said Himeko, wrapping her arms around Chikane 
and hugging her. &quot;I never want to forget you ever again.&quot;

&quot;I wonder,&quot; said Chikane. &quot;If my father remembered everything that 
happened, I wonder if ALL of the Orochi followers remember the alternate 
reality as well.&quot;

----------

Meanwhile, Kazuki Ogami was reciting his daily Shinto prayers in front 
of the kamidana at the Ogami Shrine. Yukihito was beside him, listening 
to the prayers so that he may one day become a shrinekeeper like Kazuki. 
However, as Kazuki was reciting the prayer, a strange feeling came over 
him. The recitation stopped and he opened his eyes. &quot;Mister Ogami?&quot; 
Yukihito asked. &quot;What is it?&quot; Without answering, Kazuki stood up and 
walked to the kamidana. He opened the miniature shrine and took out a 
small, wooden box. &quot;What&#39;s that, Sensei?&quot; asked Yukihito. Kazuki opened 
the box to find nothing inside it. &quot;It&#39;s...just an empty box.&quot; Yukihito 
noted.

&quot;Of course it&#39;s empty,&quot; a younger male voice came from the entrance to 
the shrine. &quot;Himeko and Chikane&#39;s mission is over. The uniforms have 
returned to the heavens.&quot; Kazuki and Yukihito turned to the entrance to 
see Souma standing in the doorway.

&quot;Souma,&quot; said Kazuki. The shrinekeeper stood up and walked to his 
adoptive brother. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; said Souma, &quot;and so is Tsubasa.&quot; Souma looked at Kazuki and 
Yukihito and said, &quot;I guess that you two were restored along with the 
rest of the world.&quot;

&quot;Souma,&quot; said Yukihito,&quot; are you sure you&#39;re feeling all right?&quot;

Kazuki laughed and said, &quot;It&#39;s a long story, Yukihito.&quot;

----------

In the mountains, the kamidana in the cave still stood, along with the 
square-shaped, metal tablet telling the story of how the world was 
remade. And the image shown on the tablet was of Himeko and Chikane, 
kissing in a loving embrace. With the Orochi gone, the world would never 
need to be rebuilt again. The image on the tablet would remain, telling 
the story of the love of the two Priestesses for the rest of eternity.

The End.

----------

TERMINOLOGY:

The Imperial Regalia of Japan are three symbols that represent virtues. 
The jewel, Yasakani no Magatama, represents benevolence; the mirror, 
Yata no Kagami, represents wisdom; and the sword, Ame no Murakumo, 
represents valor. The mirror and jewel were used to lure Amaterasu out 
of hiding when she hid in a cave during the time of the gods.

----------

OMAKE I:

Alone, Himeko and Chikane looked at each other. &quot;I guess it&#39;s time,&quot; 
said Himeko.

&quot;Himeko, wait,&quot; said Chikane. Himeko looked at Chikane, waiting to 
listen to what her beloved had to say. Chikane said, &quot;Last year, I did a 
terrible thing to you. And I could never forgive myself if I died 
without atoning for my sin.&quot; Chikane produced a flute and held it out in 
front of her, presenting it to Himeko.

&quot;Chikane,&quot; Himeko asked, &quot;what are you doing with that flute? I don&#39;t 
care how large the following of the Magical Flute is! It was a tanto, 
not a flute! Now go put that thing back with the rest of the Kashimashi 
props. It going to be pretty hard for Yasuna to play her beautiful music 
by blowing on a tanto!&quot;

----------

OMAKE II:

Himeko and Chikane celebrated the 1-year anniversary of the Orochi&#39;s 
defeat, exactly 1 month after their 18th birthday, by going to a 
Halloween party. They both dressed as characters from the anime series, 
Bleach. Chikane had dyed her hair orange, going as Orihime Inoue; Himeko 
had cut her hair and dyed it black, going as Rukia Kuchiki.

&quot;Chikane,&quot; Himeko asked, &quot;why am I Rukia?&quot;

Chikne answered, &quot;Because you don&#39;t have the boobs to pull of Orihime.&quot;

&quot;Still,&quot; said Himeko, &quot;I get the feeling that our roles are reversed 
somehow.&quot;

&quot;What I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Chikane said, &quot;is how we can be at a 
Halloween party when there is no Halloween in Japan.&quot;

&quot;Kurusugawa, Himemiya,&quot; said a male voice. Himeko and Chikane looked to 
find that Souma and Tsubasa were also attending the party. It was Souma 
that had spoken.

Himeko and Chikane stared at the brothers with very surprised looks on 
their faces. Tsubasa had dyed his hair blond and had pulled it back in a 
ponytail while Souma had dyed his hair pink. Chikane cried, &quot;Eiri and 
Shuichi?!&quot;

&quot;How would you know who we are?&quot; asked Tsubasa. &quot;I didn&#39;t think lesbians 
like you would know yaoi if it jumped up and slapped you in the face.&quot;
