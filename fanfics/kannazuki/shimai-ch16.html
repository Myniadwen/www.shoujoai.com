<body>
<p>Darkness and flame crashed against the silver sphere, making Himeko  flinch, but Chikane gripped her hand tightly and the barrier that was  Ame no Murakumo's power repelled the dark energies assaulting it. They  retreated, flying back away from the shrine. Orochi hovered there, like  a guardian watching over its final vessel.</p>
<p>Yokusemi no Mizuchi  had been immense, but the complete god dwarfed it. It vaguely resembled  the hydra of Greek legend, with a body that was somewhat reptilian, but  there was nothing clean or neat in its chaos. Chikane could actually  see bits and pieces of the eight lesser gods making it up. A row of  chitinous legs ran along its underside, clearly taken from Ooube no  Senazuchi. The black wings of Take no Sukunazuchi sprouted from its  back. The tentacles of Yatsu no Onokoshizuchi were recognizable as the  long, writhing necks of the monster, flexing around a central maw in  its &quot;chest&quot; that was the ever-changing face of Ho no Shuraizuchi.  Armored plates like Take no Yamikazuchi's lined its back, the  mismatched arms of Hi no Ashinazuchi sprouted from its sides, flexing  and clawing above the hawk-talons of Yokusemi no Mizuchi, while its  tail wasn't serpentine but mammalian, like Izuhara no Tamazuchi's but  tipped with a black barb like its first god's sword. Eyes and mouths  opened randomly, then closed and vanished within the seething chaos of  its body, and none of its leering draconic heads matched any of the  others in shape.</p>
<p>This was the <em>Gattai Orochi</em>, the  Eight-Made-One, the complete body of the god of destruction. The eight  lesser deities had been combined, their substance and their power  melded as one under the awakened will of Yamata no Orochi.</p>
<p>It was this <em>thing</em>,  Chikane thought, that was ultimately responsible for all the pain she  and Himeko had suffered, not just in this life but through all their  existences. The absolute need to defeat this abomination regardless of  the cost had shaped their choices and spawned their suffering. She  hated it beyond measure. And yet, ironically, feeling the warmth of  Himeko's hand in hers she wouldn't have given up a moment of that time.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you all right?&quot; she asked Himeko.</p>
<p>Her beloved nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;I was just a little startled at first. Orochi is really scary, you know!&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane couldn't help but chuckle.</p>
<p>&quot;Only you,&quot; she said, &quot;would see destruction incarnate precisely that way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're terrible!&quot; Himeko said with mock offense.</p>
<p><em>How strange that we can be so relaxed facing this horror,</em> Chikane thought, <em>just because we're standing together at last.</em></p>
<p><em>Only...</em></p>
<p>Yamata  no Orochi reared up above them, its immensity seeming to block out the  sun and stars so that the only light came from the violet haze that  surrounded it and the silver radiance of Ame no Murakumo. The misshapen  heads screamed out their defiance once more and Chikane could feel a  sudden, answering surge from the divine power protecting them. The two  ancient rivals, each confronted with their mortal enemy, trembled with  the urge to join in battle.</p>
<p>Chikane was about to answer that urge  when a spark of light from below caught her eye. Glancing down she  realized that it came from Minako's solar mark, a harsh, cruel light  like the noonday sun on the desert sands.</p>
<p>&quot;The Solar Priestess...&quot; she murmured.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Chikane?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Professor  Ohgami is the Solar Priestess. She can use her power--Ame no Murakumo's  power!--to support and enhance Yamata no Orochi. She'll tip the scales,  making it stronger than Ame no Murakumo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We'll lose? But what can we do?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane's  mind whirled, facts and memories falling into place as she analyzed the  situation. In seconds, she found herself smiling.</p>
<p>&quot;If she wants to imitate me and combine priestess and Neck in one body, then she can lose the same way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One  person can wield the power of Ame no Murakumo against the Gattai  Orochi. You proved that with Souma last time. He was able to match it  evenly despite his body being consumed from within by Orochi's curse.  You don't have that burden. While you fight Yamata no Orochi, I'll  descend and comfort Minako face-to-face. With her attention split she  won't be able to support the god with her power. It gives us a  chance--no, more than a chance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why?&quot; Himeko asked at once. &quot;Why do you have to be the one to risk your life?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane chuckled at her earnestness.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm asking you to fight alone against the incarnate form all of all of humanity's hatred, and you're worried about <em>me</em> risking <em>my </em>life?&quot;</p>
<p>Never all that good with irony, Himeko answered the question with the plain truth.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you are, aren't you?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane sighed.</p>
<p>&quot;Even  without Yokusemi no Mizuchi at her call, she's still both the Eighth  Neck and the Solar Priestess, with the enhanced physical powers that  brings. As Lunar Priestess, I at least have some personal power of my  own.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I don't,&quot; Himeko said, sighing back. &quot;I hate it, but you're right.&quot;</p>
<p>The  Orochi screamed again, and once more Chikane felt that terrible  pressure, the two gods eager to engage one another in the next round of  their eternal battle.</p>
<p>Himeko took Chikane's other hand as well, so that they were standing face-to-face.</p>
<p>&quot;I  know this may be our last time together, because it cost Souma his life  when he did this,&quot; she said, &quot;but I promise you again, Chikane: even if  I'm not someone special, even if I'm not a priestess any more and we  can't share eternity together, I won't let you be alone. I swear that I  will find you again and keep finding you for as long as you want me.&quot;</p>
<p>Her  eyes shone brilliantly violet, shimmering wetly in Ame no Murakumo's  silver light, and then she leaned in to kiss Chikane hard and deeply, a  farewell-but-not-goodbye kiss that Chikane gave herself over to  utterly, committing every moment of it with her to sustain herself.</p>
<p>They were both crying when they parted and released each other's hands.</p>
<p>&quot;There!  Now go and--&quot; Himeko broke off, blushing and stammering from what she  intended to say. &quot;Like Marika would have put it, g-go and k-kick her  ass!&quot;</p>
<p>A laugh bubbled up from Chikane despite herself. She used  Ame no Murakumo's power to link the sphere where they stood to the  shrine below, then let herself drop into the connection, arrowing down  towards the surface. One of Orochi's heads caught the movement and dove  towards her, spitting fire. Just before it connected, though, a bolt of  silver light crashed into the side of the head and knocked it away from  Chikane. <em>Himeko!</em> The head turned away from the lone priestess,  its attention fully claimed by the attack from its ancient enemy.  Nothing could restrain Yamata no Orochi now, and before Chikane's  horrified eyes the great bulk shot forward, its central face opened its  mouth, and it belched out a cloud of pure blackness that swallowed up  the silver glow like an eclipse blotting out the sun.</p>
<p>&quot;No!  Himeko!&quot; Chikane screamed out, terrified. Her feet touched the moon's  surface, and her distraction made her stumble slightly.</p>
<p>&quot;You're late,&quot; the purr of Minako's voice caught her attention, and her own battle was upon her.</p>
<p align="center">-X X X-</p>
<p>Darkness  swallowed up Himeko, seething, roiling waves of hatred and despair.  Without Chikane's presence, the barrier of Ame no Murakumo's power had  shrunk from a sphere to a glow that veiled Himeko's body. She'd have  really liked the sphere better, so it could keep Orochi's assault  farther away from her body. This way, it was as if she was lost and  alone in an eternity of night.</p>
<p><em>Useless thing!</em> the mad voices of Yamata no Orochi keened all around her. <em>Worthless  child! Not even fit to be Solar Priestess! The gods' joke is over at  long last! No longer will the Lunar Priestess have to bear the burden  of supporting you!</em></p>
<p>Himeko flinched from Orochi's words. How many times over the past week had they echoed in her own heart? No, they <em>were</em> from her own heart, that little piece of doubt and despair that was  Himeko's contribution to the accumulated malice that made up the dark  god. How many times had she wondered in the depths of her soul what  Chikane saw in her? What was it that brilliantly intelligent,  stunningly beautiful, kind, elegant, poised, and witty Chikane could  find to treasure or love in foolish, silly, clumsy, <em>ordinary</em> Himeko? They were good questions, questions she doubted that she'd ever find answers for.</p>
<p>They were also questions she'd stopped asking.</p>
<p>They were pointless.</p>
<p>Himeko  loved Chikane and would do anything to insure her beloved's happiness.  And since by some miracle Chikane had decided that her happiness lay  with Himeko, that settled the matter. She might never understand <em>why</em>, but she had no doubt whatsoever about <em>if</em>.</p>
<p>The  light of Ame no Murakumo shone out brightly, burning away the darkness  like the sun's rays parting the morning haze. The former priestess  called upon the power of the God of Swords and it answered in fitting  fashion, a towering blade chased in gold and silver and shining  radiantly, then a second and a third, until a dozen or more blades, a  veritable forest of swords flashed around Himeko.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane trusts me to win this fight,&quot; she flung into the teeth of the demon, &quot;and I will never, never, ever betray her!&quot;</p>
<p>Flame roared, bursting from eight throats as the swords dove towards Yamata no Orochi.</p>
<p align="center">-X X X-</p>
<p>&quot;Curious,  isn't it?&quot; Minako said casually. &quot;Here we stand on the surface of the  moon, and yet we can breathe freely, sound travels normally, and even  gravity is Earth-like. Of course, this isn't <em>really</em> the moon's  surface, but a sealed space created by the gods paralleling this area.  It's a fascinating concept, really; I can't begin to imagine how one  could start breaking down the mathematics.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How can you just stand there chatting like this was some kind of tea party?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And  of course the daughter of a construction foreman knows all about tea  parties. I would think all those multiple lifetimes would get confusing  after a while. But at least you won't have to worry about <em>that</em> problem after today.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I won't let you destroy the world, Minako.&quot;</p>
<p>The Solar Priestess smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;Over your dead body, as it were? Well, <em>bodies</em>, counting hers.&quot; She gestured upwards at the battle raging above them.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Damn</em> you!&quot; Chikane shouted as if it was a <em>kiai</em> and charged the professor. Minako smiled thinly and reached for her own  sword. As Chikane slashed, her enemy's blade flickered out in an <em>iai</em> draw that deftly parried the Lunar Priestess's attack and nearly cut her in return.</p>
<p>&quot;You've  been in my house often enough; didn't you notice the kendo trophies? I  was prefectural champion all three years in high school, nationally  ranked every year in college, and I'm still the university team's  faculty advisor,&quot; Minako said dryly as their swords rang together. &quot;Of  course, that's nothing compared to all those years you have as a sword  priestess, but then again, you aren't a Neck of Orochi any more, so  that gives me the extra strength and speed to make it up.&quot;</p>
<p><em>She's right</em>, Chikane thought. Steel rang against steel as they engaged one another. <em>I'm the more skilled fighter, but she's faster, stronger.</em></p>
<p>&quot;You shouldn't <em>have</em> to make it up,&quot; Chikane shot back at her. &quot;If it wasn't for your  arrogance, you wouldn't be fighting me now. You should have killed me  at the shrine while you had the chance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh? Why is that?&quot;</p>
<p>The  blades began to glow as the duel went on, Minako's in a harsh gold, not  the gentle warmth of Himeko's sun but a cruel heat corrupted by the  professor's Orochi nature. Chikane wondered if, had she fought like  this in her last life, would her own moonglow have been equally corrupt  instead of its soft, pale light? She launched another attack, age-old  patterns from centuries ago singing up to her through the sword,  memories of battles long ago, Solar and Lunar Priestesses dueling  together once again in that timeless dance of blades fought so many  times before.</p>
<p><em>Solar and Lunar Priestesses...</em></p>
<p><em>No! She can't be--?</em></p>
<p>&quot;Ah,  so you've figured it out at last!&quot; Minako said delightedly and forced  an disengagement. &quot;I so hoped that you would. It's so trite, for a  villain to have to explain her actions in painstaking detail just to  show off her ego.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You <em>planned</em> this! You left me alive on purpose, and Himeko too, because you <em>wanted</em> us to come after you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I'd wanted you dead, it would have been easy enough while you were under the impression I was a friend.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then  everything that's happened...the defeat of the other Necks, the freeing  of Yokusemi no Mizuchi, the summoning of Ame no Murakumo, this was all  because of your scheme, right down to this duel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, yes and no. My doing, absolutely, but it's not my plan, Chikane.&quot;</p>
<p>She launched herself into another whirlwind attack that Chikane barely blocked, the force of it jarring painfully up her arms.</p>
<p>&quot;It's <em>yours</em>.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">-X X X-</p>
<p>Himeko  never saw where the head came from. It was hard to keep track of them  all, to say nothing of fiery breath, bursts of violet lightning, or  bolts of pure, corrupting darkness! She felt sure that Ame no Murakumo  must be helping to guide her, else she couldn't imagine how she could  control all those swords while dodging as much as she could. But she'd  made a mistake after all, and the monster's enormous jaws slammed down  on her with titanic force.</p>
<p>And were stopped.</p>
<p>Teeth larger  than Himeko's entire body were halted just short of her skin by the  veil of light protecting her. Physical size wasn't relevant; this was a  matter of one god's power meeting another's. The head worried at her  like it was trying to rip a piece of meet off a carcass, making Himeko  nervous about how much damage the barrier could take. But by biting her  the Orochi head had made a fatal mistake, keeping itself fixed in one  position relative to its opponent. A half-dozen silver swords dissolved  into bolts of brilliant white lightning that blew the head apart.</p>
<p><em>Just a little longer</em>, she thought, breathing hard from the strain of bearing the power of the god. <em>Even if it's just this once, let me be able to protect Chikane!</em></p>
<p align="center">-X X X-</p>
<p>&quot;<em>My</em> plan?&quot; Chikane said incredulously, barely fending Minako off. The  Orochi was too fast to be countered normally; only by reading her body  language and combining it with her knowledge of swordplay could Chikane  react in time to do what she wanted in the fight instead of constantly  playing catch-up. Talking disrupted the concentration she needed, which  was probably why Minako was doing it.</p>
<p>The bait she dangled, though, was almost irresistible.</p>
<p>&quot;It's  true that I never believed your stories about being the reincarnated  priestesses,&quot; Minako said. &quot;That didn't mean that I wasn't <em>listening</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>She was relying on speed and reflexes more than her skill. Conversation didn't bother her at all.</p>
<p>&quot;When  I awoke as an Orochi, I didn't waste my time worrying about the sudden  shock to my worldview. From the lore handed down in my family and the  stories you and Himeko told, I knew all about how the system  worked--and I knew how I could accomplish my goals.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your...goals?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course. I may despise the world that we live in, but I don't want it destroyed forever.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  tried a complex series of strikes to attempt to confuse Minako about  where the real attack would come from, but the Solar Priestess broke it  up with a lightning riposte that left Chikane scrambling back on the  defensive.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the <em>gods</em> that I truly despise.&quot;</p>
<p>That was when Chikane started to understand.</p>
<p>&quot;That's why you set it up for us to call Ame no Murakumo. You <em>want</em> Yamata no Orochi to lose!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,  and I think we can trust your sister to handle that. She's all but  useless at ordinary things but she does have quite a way with the  impossible. No doubt that's why Ame no Murakumo picked the two of you  in the first place, since you fit together with each other so well.&quot;  She chuckled and added, &quot;You should be glad that I killed the Second  Neck; he'd have made four dirty jokes out of that line.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't you dare talk about Himeko!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why? I'm not going to hurt <em>her</em>.  It's true, of course, that I stole the mantle of Solar Priestess from  her. I'd mastered all the arts of the Ohgami priests, after all, which  use the power of Ame no Murakumo. That taught me how to manipulate the  god's energies. What the priesthood's magic always lacked was simple  power--and as an Orochi I had that. So, before the two of you awakened,  I did exactly what Marika guessed was done. I 'swiped' the role of  Solar Priestess. It took fairly unique circumstances: the power of a  Neck, the Ohgami Shrine knowledge, the fact that I knew you personally  and so could properly direct my will, all applied during that short gap  between the Orochi's awakening and your own. But it worked! I <em>am</em> the Solar Priestess of Ame no Murakumo.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  felt herself giving ground; not only was Minako's talk distracting her  against her will but it seemed to be working the Solar Priestess up  emotionally on top of that.</p>
<p>&quot;Which means that once Orochi is  defeated, I will complete the ritual of rebirth by killing you, the  Lunar Priestess. Your life will be used to restore the world, and I  will have the choice of the next world. I'll use that choose to do  exactly what you wanted Himeko to do last time: I'll choose the world  that ends the cycles forever, one with no Orochi, no Ame no Murakumo,  no reincarnations or miko or gods!&quot;</p>
<p>In spite of herself, Chikane gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;But why would you...?&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Ohgami arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p>&quot;Of <em>all</em> people <em>you</em> can ask that? Ame no Murakumo's faithful servant through multiple  lifetimes, whose reward for diligence and loyalty was to be condemned  to find your beloved, only to have to kill her at the end of it all, be  separated until Orochi was ready to break free again, rediscover one  another, then be torn apart all over again, repeat <em>ad nauseam</em>?  Until you tried to make her hate you so much that she'd wish for a  world without you in it just so she would be free of this hell?&quot;</p>
<p><em>But Himeko wouldn't accept it. Even without any memories of our past she saw through the worst things I did, and she...</em></p>
<p>&quot;It...isn't hell anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>Minako feigned a yawn.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,  yes, true love conquers all and so on and so forth. Very nice for you,  I'm sure. Meanwhile the rest of us do so enjoy being blown out of  existence and having our lives rebuilt and reshaped to match whatever  emotions a couple of teenaged girls are feeling at the time. So I'm  going to get rid of it all. Even your darling Himeko will get a new  life free from her accursed destiny. Of course, <em>you'll</em> be locked up alone in the Shrine of the Moon for, oh, all of eternity, but nothing's perfect. And besides, Chikane, it <em>is</em> what you wanted for you both before Himeko figured out how to game the system in your favor.&quot;</p>
<p>With  that, she pressed her attack again. The flashing blade snipped a bit  off one trailing sleeve, grazed Chikane's side almost delicately, and  re-opened the cut on her cheek that the Fifth Neck had inflicted.</p>
<p><em>And what happens if I win? </em>Chikane thought. <em>If I kill her, I remake the world--and then what? She'll still be Solar Priestess for the next incarnation. And Himeko...</em></p>
<p>Himeko  had known, had understood what they were getting into. As always, she  saw the big picture while Chikane was lost in the details.</p>
<p>Their  swords clashed again; Chikane was forced to block directly, jarring her  grip. Minako's foot swept up under the crossed blades and buried itself  in the pit of Chikane's stomach. The Lunar Priestess went one way while  her sword went another.</p>
<p>A tremendous bellow echoed out above  them, a scream of rage and frustration that seemed to echo to the  corners of the universe. Even as Chikane struggled back to her knees  she couldn't resist a glance upward where the immensity of Yamata no  Orochi was dissolving into a cloud of darkness that in turn dissipated  around the blazing silver star like smoke on the wind.</p>
<p>&quot;And that, I think, finishes that,&quot; Minako said smugly, thrusting at Chikane's heart.</p>
<p>Her sword didn't get there.</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko!&quot;</p>
<p>The  former priestess's hands had clapped together, catching the flat of the  blade between them, only her timing had been off. The blade had already  pierced her body by the time she caught it, the tip emerging from her  back.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry...I'm late...Chikane,&quot; she said, then coughed, a  trickle of blood spilling over her lip. The Solar Blade had obviously  punctured a lung.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, <em>please</em>. Now I have to kill you to get to her? Can this <em>possibly</em> get any more trite?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's...not it...&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko smiled serenely, her eyes closing.</p>
<p>&quot;And what do you think you can do? You'll bleed out in minutes, or drown in your own blood.&quot;</p>
<p>Then  the symbol of the Solar Priestess blazed up brilliantly. It stunned  Chikane--but then she realized that Minako, too, wore a look of  complete surprise. Then the Solar Blade began to glow with a brilliant  golden light, spreading out from Himeko's palms to encompass the entire  sword.</p>
<p>And Chikane understood, and laughed out loud.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't you see, Professor? <em>She</em> carries the full power of Ame no Murakumo, and you aren't protected by Orochi any more!&quot;</p>
<p>As  the sword's glow grew brighter, the shine from the solar mark dwindled  away until it went out at last. A single tear trickled down Himeko's  cheek.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; she whispered.</p>
<p>Three bolts of silver  light descended from above, striking the Eighth Neck with force that  could obliterate mountains, blasting Minako Ohgami's body to ash. As if  the other woman's grip on her sword had been the only thing holding  Himeko upright, the blonde sagged to the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko!  Himeko!&quot; Chikane scrambled over to her, cradling the wounded girl in  her arms. &quot;Himeko! Oh, Gods, please don't let this happen!&quot; The breast  of her white robe was drenched crimson from the wound and Chikane  started to rip it away in the vain hope that there was somehow <em>something</em> she could do to stanch the bleeding.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry. I...messed up again,&quot; Himeko said with an embarrassed smile. &quot;I heard...what she said to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You heard all that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ame  no Murakumo...&quot; she answered the unspoken &quot;how?&quot; Her smile turned  tender and she added, &quot;Couldn't let her...do that...to you...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko! I don't want you to sacrifice yourself for my sake!&quot;</p>
<p>She didn't blush.</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn't just to protect you.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Is her voice getting </em>stronger<em>?</em></p>
<p>&quot;I was selfish too, Chikane. I don't ever want to be part of a world without you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But to throw yourself in front of her sword...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  wasn't trying that. I was trying your sword-catch, but I didn't get it  right,&quot; Himeko admitted. &quot;But I had to do it in person. I didn't think  a barrier would work.&quot;</p>
<p><em>No, it wouldn't</em>. The Solar Blade  had pierced the silver veil around Himeko like it hadn't been there;  the sword was as much a manifestation of Ame no Murakumo's powers as  that which Himeko had wielded. The barrier wouldn't stop itself from  crossing.</p>
<p>&quot;But I was clumsy. I...messed it up...again.&quot; Her voice  started to fade again and terror stabbed at Chikane's heart. The silver  light began to ebb and then flickered out.</p>
<p>&quot;No! Himeko! <em>Himeko!</em>&quot; Chikane screamed.</p>
<p><strong>Lunar Priestess.</strong></p>
<p>The  sigil on her back burned, and her head jerked up. It was a voice she  knew all too well. The God of Swords acted more like a weapon than a  deity while Orochi was active, its will awakening only when the dark  god was beaten.</p>
<p><strong>Lunar Priestess, time grows short.</strong></p>
<p>It  was there, towering over them, a great armored figure like a Western  knight in elaborate bright-golden armor and haloed by a ring of fire.  Its breastplate shone with the combined symbols of sun and moon, the  sigil seemingly graven there in pure light. One great hand was  outstretched, its gauntlet immense enough that it could have easily  cupped both girls in its palm, and before Chikane's eyes the Lunar  Shrine began to rebuild itself: the elegant building in traditional  style atop its six-pillared platform, the long staircase ascending to  it, and the two prayer gates at its base, all intact and pristine.</p>
<p>&quot;Time? Himeko is dying!&quot; Chikane cried.</p>
<p><strong>Yes. The Solar Priestess has sustained a mortal wound.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The  Solar--But she's not...&quot; Chikane looked back down and saw what she'd  missed before. The mark of the sun was glimmering faintly from its  accustomed place atop the cleft between Himeko's breasts. &quot;But how?&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko smiled at her.</p>
<p>&quot;I...took it back...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Through  me, the Solar Priestess reclaimed her rightful role. However, the  usurper's work has created an imbalance. It lies with you to act, Lunar  Priestess.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;An imbalance?&quot; Chikane could barely think, things were happening so fast.</p>
<p><strong>The  false Solar Priestess has mortally wounded the true one. When her life  ends, there will be no one capable of reviving the world.</strong></p>
<p><em>The ritual of rebirth. That </em>damned<em> ceremony</em>,  Chikane thought, understanding. Just as Minako had tried to carry it  out in her fight with Chikane, she and Himeko had actually done it as  they passed the position of Solar Priestess between themselves. The  Solar Priestess had struck the blow. The Solar Priestess was dying from  it. The energies released by Himeko's death and imprisonment within the  shrine would be the spark that kindled the revival of the world to  come, a world chosen by her slayer.</p>
<p>Only, Minako Ohgami was dead. She wasn't capable of choosing anything.</p>
<p><strong>You  must act, Lunar Priestess. My power sustains the Solar Priestess's  existence beyond what could commonly be endured, but her time is  finite. You must repeat the ceremony while life still remains to her.</strong></p>
<p>Chikane's gorge rose; she seemed to be choking as she realized at last what Ame no Murakumo was truly saying.</p>
<p>&quot;You...you  mean that if I kill Himeko now, before she bleeds to death, then the  ability to choose the new world will be transferred to me.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>That is so.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;No! You can't ask this of me! Not again!&quot; Of all things, to take Himeko's life with her own hands...<em>I can't bear it again! I can't!</em></p>
<p><strong>It must be.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;But  in our last lives, Himeko wasn't the one who killed me! I was wounded  in my fight with the other Necks and once Orochi was sealed bled out  without its regenerative power, but Himeko still got to choose then.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Your  wounds were not inflicted by a priestess. The role of choice had not  been claimed and could be assumed by the Solar Priestess in the absence  of a prior claim. That is not so in the present.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Please...Chikane...&quot; Himeko's voice was starting to grow weaker again, barely louder than a whisper.</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko!&quot; She was sobbing now, the tears streaming down her face. &quot;I can't do this to you again!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm so sorry. If only...I hadn't been...so clumsy I'd...have spared you this....But now you...have to--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane, please. I...I trust you...&quot;</p>
<p><em>Oh, Himeko!</em></p>
<p><strong>Lunar Priestess.</strong></p>
<p>She  had no choice. But when had she ever? This was their fate, the destiny  of the priestesses of the Godless Month, their own inescapable prison.  Gently, she wrapped her fingers around the hilt of the Solar Blade and  pulled it as smoothly as she could manage from Himeko's body. Despite  her efforts, Himeko winced and gave a little cry, making Chikane's  stomach clench from her shame. Himeko wasn't strong enough to kneel  upright, so she supported herself with one hand while the other  tremblingly pulled her long, blonde hair out of the way, baring her  neck for the strike.</p>
<p>Chikane wiped the tears from her eyes on her  sleeve--at least she could make it a clean cut--raised the sword, and  brought it down in a lightning-swift motion.</p>
<p><strong>It is done!</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Himeko...&quot;</p>
<p>With  a wordless scream of fury she hurled the bloodstained sword away with  all her might; it sparkled in the golden light emanating from the god.  Chikane dropped to her knees and reached out to take the corpse in her  arms, but before she could touch it the body and severed head alike  were wreathed in that same bright gold, dissolving into firefly motes  that swirled up around Chikane. A wind seemed to blow out of nowhere,  making Chikane's hair and her trailing garments swirl around her,  sweeping the glimmering lights away towards the shrine. Did she  see--just for an instant--the image of a figure on those stairs,  looking back over her shoulder with sorrow in her eyes?</p>
<p><strong>The choice now lies with you, Lunar Priestess, of which of eight possible worlds to be revived.</strong></p>
<p>Eight  worlds, or eight million? There were eight basic structures, eight  frameworks establishing the relationships between humans and the gods,  but so many gradations within them, shades with which to color that  choice. It was the heart of the priestess making the selection that  shaped the revived world for good or ill. They'd seen that, how the  last world revived by Chikane had been tainted by her despair and  longing and fell all too soon to Orochi, while that selected by Himeko  had been marked by a weakened demon.</p>
<p>&quot;My love...&quot; she whispered. &quot;Why couldn't this decision be yours?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Choose!</strong></p>
<p><em>Chikane, I trust you.</em></p>
<p>Himeko's last words.</p>
<p><em>I've  murdered you, sentenced your soul to be imprisoned alone, deceived you,  raped you, manipulated and tormented you, and now murdered you yet  again. And still you call this love? Still you trust me? Who could  believe such a thing?</em></p>
<p>&quot;Why did this have to happen again?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>We are, all of us, bound by necessity.</strong></p>
<p>Was it her imagination, or did the god's voice sound almost sympathetic?</p>
<p><strong>Should this pain be too great to bear, you need not endure it again.</strong></p>
<p>That had been Minako's wish. It had been <em>Chikane's</em> own plan in her past life.</p>
<p><em>Chikane, I trust you.</em></p>
<p>Tears trickled freshly down her face, hot against her skin.</p>
<p>&quot;I've decided.&quot;</p>
<p>She took a deep breath.</p>
<p>&quot;The world I choose is--&quot;</p>
<p align="center">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p>
<p><em>A/N:  I suspect that Chikane would take Himeko's confusion over why Chikane  loves her and toss it right back: why would sweet, innocent, gentle,  kind, Friend-to-All-Living-Things Himeko love a sadistic, manipulative,  deceitful sociopath like Chikane? But like Himeko noted, it's the fact  of it that matters, not the reasons. Love's like that.</em></p>
<p><em>Incidentally,  in case anyone's wondering, I did note that one possible ending would  be for Himeko to just blast Minako away from the air rather than trying  to block the sword. Since Himeko wouldn't reclaim the Solar Priestess  status then, it would give Chikane the choice of world. Then, if  Chikane picked the no-Orochi world, Minako would have been locked up in  the Shrine forever and ever while Chikane (as surviving priestess) and  Himeko (as a normal person) would have been reborn into their lives and  could have lived them out together as ordinary happy people, freed of  the cycle forever. As you've probably noticed by now, though, that </em>isn't<em> Chikane's ideal happiness, and Himeko's thoughtful that way.  Unfortunately, she was a little slow in the rescue, meaning that you  all get one last cliffhanger.</em></p>
<p><em>You'll now notice why it was  that I made a point a few chapters back about talking about the  priestesses' ability to resist (though not regenerate) the effects of  physical damage. It's why Chikane held on so long in the original  series (especially the anime), and it keeps Himeko alive long enough  for the conclusion to happen here.</em></p>
<p><em>And yes, if Himeko  hadn't been so weak, she could have been the one to kill Chikane and  pick the new world here; unfortunately there was no way she'd have the  strength to bear the spiritual weight of all the energies of  creation...or the physical capacity to actually kill Chikane.</em></p>
