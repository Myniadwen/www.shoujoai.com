<h1>Spiral of Destiny (part 24 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kannazuki/index.html">Kannazuki no Miko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nwarford.html">Nathan Warford</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kannazuki/kannanisou-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>Chikane, Himeko, and Orochi all stared in awe at the great, earthly god 
that stood before them. &quot;Susanou...?&quot; said Orochi&#39;s second head.

&quot;How can you be here?&quot; the first head asked.

&quot;The seashell,&quot; Chikane realized, seeing the pink bivalve imbedded in 
the hilt of the ten-bladed sword that Susanou held.

&quot;That has to be it,&quot; said Himeko. &quot;Susanou is the God of the Sea. The 
bivalve came from the sea, so he must have reacted to the joining of the 
two halves.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re half-right,&quot; Susanou said in a deep, strong voice. &quot;Were it an 
ordinary bivalve, it would have meant nothing to me. And it would have 
been an ordinary bivalve too were it not in your hands, the Solar 
Priestess and the Lunar Priestess.&quot;

&quot;It was us...&quot; Himeko said. &quot;It was our bond that summoned you.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just as Tsukuyomi said,&quot; said Chikane, tears coming to her eyes. 
&quot;We&#39;re just like that bivalve, neither of us complete without the 
other.&quot;

&quot;Each other&#39;s other half,&quot; Himeko finished, tears of joy in her eyes as 
well.

&quot;Your love summoned Susanou?!&quot; cried Orochi&#39;s eight heads.

&quot;Damn it,&quot; the eighth head groaned. &quot;How could I have not anticipated 
this?&quot;

&quot;Tsukuyomi,&quot; said Susanou turning to the purple mech, &quot;thank you for 
protecting and guiding my descendant.&quot;

Tsukuyomi&#39;s voice came from the mech, &quot;Of course, Brother Susanou.&quot;

&quot;It does not matter,&quot; decried Orochi&#39;s eighth head. &quot;You had us at a 
disadvantage the last time we fought, Susanou no Mikoto. You intoxicated 
us with those eight vats of eight-times brewed rice wine. You tricked us 
all those centuries ago. But we will not be fooled a second time! And 
even if you wanted to intoxicate me again, you wouldn&#39;t be able to. You 
don&#39;t have any sake!&quot;

&quot;I am still an earthly deity,&quot; Susanou said, pulling his mask over his 
face. &quot;That means that I still have the power to hurt you!&quot; Susanou 
turned to the Priestesses and said, &quot;We all attack him together as one.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; said Chikane.

&quot;Right,&quot; said Himeko, right behind her.

The three smaller gods took stances at Orochi. Orochi coiled his eight 
heads, ready to strike at his attackers. Susanou, Tsukuyomi, and 
Amaterasu all charged at Orochi and Orochi threw his heads toward them. 
Several of Orochi&#39;s heads collided with the ground as the three smaller 
gods dodged them. Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu fired bolts of energy from the 
tips of their swords, trying to distract the eight-headed serpent from 
Susanou, who was preparing to strike at Orochi with the Ten-Fisted 
Sword.

One of Orochi&#39;s heads struck at Susanou, but the earthly god jumped into 
the air, barely dodging the attack. As Susanou fell from the sky, he 
swung his blade at Orochi, leaving ten large cuts in the snake&#39;s body. 
Orochi roared in pain and swung at Susanou with his tail. Susanou 
blocked the tail with his sword, but was still thrown several hundred 
meters away.

Tsukuyomi struck at Orochi with Ame no Murakumo&#39;s blade, but Orochi shot 
chains from his third head&#39;s mouth. The chains wrapped around the sword, 
keeping Chikane from using it to strike Orochi. Then, Amaterasu jumped 
onto the scene and sliced through the chain with the blade on its left 
wrist. Chikane jumped toward Orochi and swung at him, leaving another 
cut in his body.

However, in his true form, Yamata no Orochi was much faster than Gattai 
Orochi. Before Himeko and Chikane could react, two of Orochi&#39;s heads 
struck at them. They held out their Priestess Blades, colliding with 
Orochi&#39;s teeth so that he would not swallow them whole. However, two 
more of Orochi&#39;s heads came at them. Susanou jumped in the heads&#39; path, 
blocking both of them with the ten-bladed sword.

However, four more heads still towered over the three smaller gods. &quot;Ha 
ha ha ha ha,&quot; Orochi&#39;s eighth head laughed. &quot;I still outnumber you, 
eight to three.&quot;

&quot;You think that numbers will decide this battle?&quot; Susanou asked. &quot;How 
naive you are.&quot; The Ten-Fisted Sword surged with electricity, then shot 
bolts of lightening into the two heads that Susanou was holding off. The 
electricity quickly spread through Orochi&#39;s monstrous body, causing his 
eight heads to spasm, allowing the three gods to free themselves from 
Orochi&#39;s teeth. Susanou and Tsukuyomi struck at Orochi again while he 
was still stunned, leaving eleven more cuts in his body.

&quot;You forget that I am also a Storm God,&quot; said Susanou to Orochi. &quot;I do 
not only have power over the seas, but power over the sky as well.&quot;

&quot;You can be sure then,&quot; said Orochi&#39;s eighth head, all of the heads 
regaining their senses, &quot;that I will not let myself be hit with your 
lightening attack again.&quot;

All eight of Orochi&#39;s heads called out, &quot;Blazing Earth Tremor!&quot; Orochi 
started spinning his tail around, the sword embedded in the long member 
kicking up burning pieces of Earth. The tremors created by Orochi&#39;s body 
caught the three small gods off-balance, but Susanou held up his sword 
toward the skies. Lightening fired from the sword into the heavens. The 
sky suddenly was filled with storm clouds and rain started in seconds. 
Even though it was difficult for the gods to move due to the tremors, 
the rain extinguished the fire that Orochi&#39;s tail threw at them, turning 
them to ordinary pieces of Earth. The pieces of land simply bounced off 
of the gods&#39; armor, causing no damage to them.

&quot;Fine then,&quot; Orochi&#39;s eight head said. &quot;You want to use rain? I can use 
that to my advantage!&quot; Orochi&#39;s second head opened its mouth and fired 
lightning at the three gods that were still shaken by Orochi&#39;s Earth 
Tremor. The falling rain acted as a conductor for the lightening, 
Orochi&#39;s electric attack jumping from rain-drop to rain-drop, straight 
toward Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, and Susanou. Susanou, held up his sword 
again, and drew all of Orochi&#39;s lightening to it. The ten blades 
absorbed the lightning, nullifying Orochi&#39;s attack.

&quot;I thought you were smarter than that,&quot; Susanou said smugly. &quot;The 
alcohol must be getting to you.&quot;

&quot;Alcohol?&quot; asked Orochi&#39;s eighth head. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t notice the scent,&quot; Susanou said, getting to 
his feet. He took the comb out of his hair and threw it into the air. In 
a flash of light, the comb transformed into a beautiful woman, only 
slightly shorter than Susanou. She had black hair, dark brown eyes, and 
wore an elegant kimono, white as rice. She wore a face mask, similar to 
that of a ninja, and she held a large tub in her hands, filled with 
sake! &quot;My lovely wife brewed this eight-times distilled rice wine before 
we came here and she has been spreading it through the air as a vapor 
while we were fighting!&quot;

&quot;Kushinada-Hime...&quot; Orochi&#39;s fourth head growled.

&quot;The masks!&quot; Chikane realized. &quot;Susanou and Kushinada weren&#39;t 
intoxicated by the fumes because of their masks!&quot;

&quot;And we&#39;re not effected either because of Tsukuyomi&#39;s and Amaterasu&#39;s 
face plates!&quot; realized Himeko.

&quot;I will never forgive you for killing my sisters,&quot; said Kushinada, her 
eyebrows curved inward in a hateful glare. &quot;Susanou made sure that I, 
the last of my parents&#39; eight daughters, would not become fodder for 
your eighth head.&quot;

&quot;Damn you,&quot; groaned Orochi&#39;s second head, his speech taking on a slight 
slur.

&quot;I may be drunk,&quot; said Orochi&#39;s third head, &quot;but I will not be defeated 
by you again!&quot; The third head struck at Kushinada.

&quot;No, you fool!&quot; Orochi&#39;s eighth head cried. But it was too late. 
Kushinada threw the entire tub of sake at the third head. The alcohol 
burned the third head&#39;s eyes and he recoiled in pain. Most of the sake, 
however, had entered the third head&#39;s mouth. &quot;Don&#39;t swallow!&quot; cried the 
eighth head in vain.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; the third head slurred as he swallowed the sake. &quot;I just 
can&#39;t resist rice wine.&quot;

&quot;Damn it,&quot; said Orochi&#39;s other heads, now fully feeling the effects of 
the alcohol.

Tsukuyomi summoned an arrow from Ame no Murakumo&#39;s wing and aimed at 
Orochi. &quot;One more strike should do it,&quot; said Chikane. Chikane fired the 
arrow and Orochi was too intoxicated to react quickly enough. The arrow 
hit the third head squarely in the forehead and exploded, throwing his 
head back so violently that it broke his neck. The force of the blast 
knocked the other heads unconscious as well.

Susanou approached the inebriated Yamata no Orochi and raised his sword. 
With Orochi out cold, there was nothing stopping Susanou from hacking 
off each of Yamata no Orochi&#39;s heads.

----------

When he was finished decapitating each of the eight heads, Susanou 
removed his mask and wiped his brow. &quot;Are you all right, Susanou-sama?&quot; 
Kushinada asked, walking to his side.

&quot;I&#39;m just fine, my darling wife,&quot; said Susanou, putting an arm around 
Kushinada.

Just then, the eight decapitated heads of Yamata no Orochi started 
stirring. Himeko and Chikane readied themselves for another battle, but 
Susanou raised his hand, motioning them to stop. The mouths of Orochi&#39;s 
heads opened, and out of the mouths climbed the eight bodies of Orochi. 
Take no Yasukunazuchi climbed from Orochi&#39;s first head, Yatsu no 
Onokoshizuchi came from Orochi&#39;s second head, Hi no Ashinazuchi from the 
third head, Ooube no Senazuchi from the fourth head, Ho no Shuraizuchi 
from the fifth head, Izuhara no Tamazuchi from the sixth head, Take no 
Yamikazuchi from the seventh head, and Yokusemi no Mizuchi from the 
eighth head. All of the Orochi bodies were in their sealed forms, in 
their original colors with their mouth plates firmly closed.

The eight bodies kneeled and the Orochi members exited through the 
circular portals in their other selves&#39; chests. Tsubasa exited from Take 
no Yasukunazuchi, Miyako from Yatsu no Onokoshizuchi, Girochi from Hi no 
Ashinazuchi, Korona from Ooube no Senazuchi, Rehko from Ho no 
Shuraizuchi, and Nekoko from Izuhara no Tamazuchi.

Then, Himeko saw someone exit from the circular portal on Take no 
Yamikazuchi&#39;s chest. &quot;Ogami!&quot; she cried, recognizing the teenaged boy 
that had exited from the blue mech. Himeko exited Amaterasu Oomikami and 
ran toward Souma. &quot;OGAMI!!&quot; Himeko cried.

Souma raised his head to look at the girl running toward him. 
&quot;Kurusugawa?&quot; he said, not fully comprehending what had happened. As he 
regained his senses, Souma realized that he was actually there and that 
Himeko actually was running toward him. &quot;Kurusugawa!&quot; cried Souma. 
Himeko ran into Souma&#39;s arms and they held each other tightly.

The other six Orochi got to their feet, attempting to make sense of the 
situation. &quot;What happened?&quot; said Korona.

&quot;It seems that Orochi tricked us,&quot; said Tsubasa. &quot;He didn&#39;t care about 
us at all. All he cared about was regaining his former strength.&quot;

Then, someone started emerging from the portal in Yokusemi no Mizuchi&#39;s 
body. &quot;Who&#39;s that?&quot; wondered Himeko.

&quot;Ame no Murakumo was the Eighth Neck,&quot; said Souma. &quot;She&#39;s too large to 
come from a portal that size.&quot;

Chikane suddenly emerged from the portal in Tsukuyomi no Mikoto&#39;s chest. 
She started walking toward the bird-shaped mech, her eyes wide with 
anticipation. She ran toward Yokusemi no Mizuchi, hoping that the person 
emerging from the eighth Orochi body was who she thought it was. And 
sure enough, the person exiting Yokusemi no Mizuchi was her father, 
Takeshi Himemiya. Exhausted from Orochi&#39;s control over his body, he 
collapsed to the ground in front of his daughter.

&quot;Father!&quot; cried Chikane, throwing herself on top of Takeshi. Takeshi 
looked up at his daughter, his soft brown eyes just as hazy as the Seven 
Necks were when they first exited their other selves.

&quot;Chikane?&quot; he said.

&quot;Yes, Father,&quot; said Chikane, embracing Takeshi and burying her face in 
his chest. &quot;It&#39;s me.&quot;

&quot;Chikane, my daughter!&quot; Takeshi cried, embracing Chikane as well.

While the Priestesses and Orochi&#39;s followers reunited with one another, 
Susanou went to the remains of Yamata no Orochi and sliced open the 
tail. Out of the tail he pulled the Ame no Murakumo, which was much 
smaller than its original size due to the loss of its power to Orochi. 
&quot;Priestesses, Orochi members,&quot; said Susanou. &quot;There is only one way to 
end this fight once and for all.&quot;

Chikane, Himeko, Takeshi, and the Seven Necks looked at Susanou. &quot;How?&quot; 
asked Souma.

&quot;You must become the power of the Ten-Fisted Sword,&quot; Susanou answered. 
&quot;When I defeated Orochi so many centuries ago, I only had my own power 
to defeat Orochi with. When I drew the Ame no Murakumo from Yamata no 
Orochi&#39;s tail, I knew that it was dangerous for it to remain in this 
world. But the Ame no Murakumo was so sturdy that I could not destroy it 
with my Ten-Fisted Sword. Piece of my sword was even chipped when I 
tried to slice Ame no Murakumo like I had sliced Orochi. All I could do 
to make sure that Ame no Murakumo would not revive Orochi was to use her 
power to seal both her and Orochi inside the Lunar Shrine.&quot;

&quot;So that&#39;s why Ame no Murakumo is always locked away when her duties are 
fulfilled,&quot; Himeko realized. &quot;She was too dangerous to remain in this 
world for too long. That&#39;s why we have to awaken her every time we 
reincarnate.&quot;

&quot;The revival ceremony is also necessary to prove that you are the Shrine 
Maiden of the Sun and the Shrine Maiden of the Moon,&quot; Susanou continued. 
&quot;But now that I have all of you beside me, you can use your powers to 
increase the power of the Ten-Fisted Sword. Then it may be strong enough 
to destroy the Ame no Murakumo and make sure that Orochi never returns 
again.&quot;

&quot;Brother Tsubasa,&quot; said Souma, walking to the tall First Neck. 
&quot;Kurusugawa and Himemiya have suffered enough. It&#39;s time to stop 
fighting.&quot;

Tsubasa turned to the other Necks, who were looking at him intently. 
&quot;Whatever you decide, Master Tsubasa,&quot; said Miyako, &quot;we will follow 
you.&quot;

Tsubasa looked back at Souma, who was looking at him with a very serious 
expression. Tsubasa closed his eyes and made a deep sigh. &quot;I cannot 
condone a monster that would use us as pawns for his own selfish agenda. 
Besides, no matter how hard I try,&quot; he said, opening his eyes and 
looking at Souma, &quot;I can never refuse my little brother.&quot;

&quot;Everyone,&quot; Susanou commanded, &quot;gather around me.&quot; Himeko, Chikane, 
Takeshi, and the Seven Necks all gathered around Susanou in a circle. As 
Susanou held up the Ten-Fisted Sword, the ten humans gathered around the 
earthly deity started glowing. Their bodies turned into beams of light, 
each beam entering a blade, causing the blades to glow as well. Susanou 
swung his empowered Ten-Fisted Sword at the Ame no Murakumo. After 
several swings, the legendary sword began to crack.

Finally, after several hard swings, Susanou&#39;s Ten-Fisted Sword shattered 
the Ame no Murakumo. With the first seven Necks on the side of good and 
with the Eighth Neck destroyed, simply hacking Yamata no Orochi&#39;s body 
into tiny pieces was enough to destroy the dark aura that was Orochi&#39;s 
spirit. And without Orochi&#39;s power sustaining them, the eight Orochi 
mechs turned to stone and crumbled. After bowing to the vanquished Ame 
no Murakuno and Yamata no Orochi, Susanou held out his sword and the ten 
beams of light exited the blades, regaining their human forms around 
Susanou.

&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; said Himeko, a large smile coming to her face.

&quot;It&#39;s over,&quot; said Chikane, a smile coming to her face as well.

Souma turned to Tsubasa and said, &quot;Thank you, Brother.&quot;

&quot;I wonder just how much good I did,&quot; said Tsubasa, looking around 
himself. &quot;The world was destroyed anyway.&quot;

Souma gasped and turned to the Priestesses. &quot;Then that means...&quot;

Himeko and Chikane looked at each other, the same horrified expressions 
on their faces. Himeko turned to Susanou and said, &quot;Susanou, is there 
some way that we can restore the world without sacrificing ourselves?&quot;

&quot;There has to be something you can do,&quot; said Chikane.

&quot;I am sorry,&quot; said the earthly god. &quot;If I use up any more of my power, I 
will not be able to perform my duties as the God of the Sea. The cosmic 
balance will become even more disrupted than it already is. There is a 
reason that all of the gods gather at Izumo during the month of 
Kannazuki.&quot;

It was only then that everyone noticed the damage that Tsukuyomi, 
Amaterasu, and Susanou&#39;s absense from Izumo had caused. Up in the sky, 
they saw the moon falling and the sun dimming. And below them, the sea 
was beginning to dry up, sea level dropping by several centimeters a 
second. 

&quot;As much as I hate to say it,&quot; said Susanou, &quot;Ame no Murakumo was right. 
The blood of a Priestess must be spilled. The only way to restore both 
the world AND the heavens is through the sacrifice of the Kannazuki no 
Miko, the Priestesses of the Godless Month.&quot;

Chikane stared at Susanou, her face overcome with an expression of fear 
and sadness. &quot;It can&#39;t be...&quot; she choked out.

&quot;I am sorry, my child,&quot; said Susanou with a sad look on his face. &quot;There 
is no other way.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Chikane,&quot; said Himeko, putting her hand on the taller girl&#39;s 
shoulder. &quot;Even if we&#39;re locked away inside the Lunar Shrine, we&#39;ll be 
together.&quot;

Chikane&#39;s head lowered. &quot;You&#39;re right, Himeko,&quot; she said with a 
bittersweet smile. &quot;We&#39;ll be together. That&#39;s all that matters.&quot; She 
then looked at her beloved through teary eyes. &quot;I just hoped that we 
could live normal lives for once.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; said Himeko, her eyes full of tears as well. Himeko and 
Chikane embraced each other. They were sorry that they had to sacrifice 
themselves to remake the world, but at the same time happy that they 
could spend the rest of eternity together without having to worry about 
Orochi ever again.

Susanou and Kishinada disappeared, the bivalve in Susanou&#39;s sword 
splitting back into its two halves, both of them finding their places 
around the Priestesses&#39; necks. With the God of the Sea gone, the sea 
level stopped dropping.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry that we caused you so much trouble,&quot; said Miyako, walking up 
to the Priestesses.

&quot;Our lives are actually not as bad as we thought,&quot; said Korona. &quot;I may 
not be the best singer in the world, but I&#39;m still in the top hundred on 
Oricon.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;ve actually begun to enjoy this manga that I&#39;m working on,&quot; Rehko 
said, a surprising amount of emotion in her voice.

&quot;And people all over the world are working to stop animal testing, nya,&quot; 
said Nekoko.

&quot;Lunar Priestess,&quot; Girochi said, &quot;I admit defeat. You&#39;ve proven to me, 
and to all of us, that nothing is strong enough to rip Hime from your 
grasp.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry about that, too,&quot; said Souma. &quot;I knew that the bond that you 
shared couldn&#39;t be broken. I stopped persisting last year and I 
shouldn&#39;t have started persisting again this year.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; said Himeko. &quot;You were all under the influence of Orochi&#39;s 
evil. Now that he&#39;s gone, you can all go about your lives as if nothing 
had happened. The world will be remade and you will live out your lives 
in a world free from the Orochi.&quot;

&quot;Chikane,&quot; Takeshi said, walking to his daughter. &quot;I am more to blame 
than anyone else. I believed so strongly that I needed Orochi&#39;s power to 
maintain control over my business partners. And I shouldn&#39;t have dragged 
you into this mess.&quot;

Chikane closed her eyes and put her hands together. &quot;Father, I pray for 
the prosperity of the Himemiya family and its continued good fortune.&quot; 
Chikane opened her eyes and smiled at her father. &quot;We&#39;re descendants of 
Susanou no Mikoto. I&#39;m sure that he&#39;ll honor my prayer and watch over 
our family.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, my daughter.&quot; Takeshi took Chikane&#39;s head in his hands and 
kissed her forehead. With the Priestesses and the former Orochi 
followers reconciled, Himeko and Chikane went back to Amaterasu and 
Tsukuyomi, who flew the Priestesses back to Japan to begin the Last Rite 
of the Kannazuki no Miko.

To be continued...

TERMINOLOGY:

Oricon is a weekly music hit-shart in Japan. It is the chart that Korona 
was placed 68th on.

OMAKE:

&quot;The alcohol must be getting to you,&quot; said Susanou.

&quot;Alcohol?&quot; asked Orochi&#39;s eighth head. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t notice the scent,&quot; Susanou said. He took the 
comb out of his hair and threw it into the air. In a flash of light, the 
comb transformed into a beautiful woman, only slightly shorter than 
Susanou. She had black hair, dark brown eyes, and wore an elegant 
yukata, white as rice. She wore a face mask, similar to that of a ninja, 
and she held a large tub in her hands, filled with sake! &quot;My lovely wife 
brewed this eight-times distilled rice wine before we came here and she 
has been spreading it through the air as a vapor while we were 
fighting!&quot;

&quot;Kushinada-Hime...&quot; Orochi&#39;s growled.

Just then, Susanou and Kushinada started feeling woozy. &quot;What&#39;s 
happening to us, Susanou-sama?&quot; Kushinada asked.

&quot;These masks must not be protecting us from the fumes,&quot; said Susanou. He 
removed his mask and looked at the label. &quot;No wonder,&quot; he said. &quot;These 
stupid masks were manufactured in Taiwan.&quot;
