.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>Why
have you not waken, Himeko?” Himemiya Chikane murmured softly. “It has been one
day already. Why are you sleeping still?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>In the
waning light of the late noon sun, shooting its rays through the shoji doors
and painting every thing within the large traditional tatami room with a sickly
orange color, Kurusugawa Himeko, breathing soundly with her eyes closed beneath
a thick blanket and atop a large futon, gave no evidence she heard. Chikane
sighed. She had summoned Katou-sensei, the Himemiya’s family doctor, to ensure
everything was well with the little angel but the woman, too, had no clue as to
why the girl had been dozing off for such a long period of time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>In any case, Chikane did not worry too much about Himeko’s
condition. The little angel was merely immersed in a dreamless slumber, since
she had not muttered a word during the twenty-four hours Chikane had spent
watching over her, which was a good thing. The girl needed a good rest after
all the nerve-wrecking events that had happened the day before. Chikane sighed
again. So much for the private birthday party she had been looking forward to
spending with Himeko. So much for the confession she had been planning to make
under the flickering candlelight of their romantic meal, so much for the hope
of receiving her first kiss....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Flame raged on Chikane’s cheeks. As a matter of fact, she <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>did</span></i> confess to Himeko in
the heat of the moment yesterday... and she <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>did</span></i>
give Himeko her very first kiss shortly afterwards. The only problem was that
the little angel had been out cold the whole time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Before Chikane knew what she was doing, her fingers were
already tracing the outline of her lips. A full day had already passed, yet
what she had felt still lingered and refused to fade. The lips of the little
angel were soft and smooth as silk, blessed with a sweetness honey failed to
match. Much had Chikane wondered what it would be like to claim the lips of the
one she loved, she never expected the current of lightning that ran through her
body at the contact and made her wish the moment would last forever. And that
was but a one-sided kiss, stolen from a girl who was still unconscious from the
power blast Oogami Souma had directed her way. Had Himeko been <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>awake</span></i>... had she been <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>aware</span></i>....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>She would
have slapped me,</span></i> Chikane thought, her heart sinking faster than a
rock in water. Shame and guilt, hot as molten lava, welled in her so rapidly
she thought they would reduce her to ashes. What had happened to year after
year of careful upbringing under the roof of the Himemiya family, wealthiest
and most respectable Clan of the nation, she asked herself. What had happened
to the girl who had been in absolute control of her emotions, however tumultuously
they always acted whenever she set eyes upon the golden-haired angel? How dared
she steal something only Himeko had the right to give?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Chikane did not know. It had seemed so right, so natural to
do such a thing at that time that she never spared herself a second thought
before proceeding to kiss Himeko.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Chikane touched her lips again. Guilt and shame heavier than
a mountain, sharper than a butcher’s knife... yet there was no regret.
Somewhere in her heart, she was actually <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>overjoyed</span></i>
that her first kiss had been given to the one she loved, the one by whose side
she wished to spend eternity. Perhaps... that was what it meant to be in love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Chikane took a lock of Himeko’s golden hair into her hand and
started to brush it in silence. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>It
is not fair, Himeko, </span></i>she thought. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>How
is it that you fascinate me so? When you look at me, I can barely keep my heart
from rising into my throat. When you touch me, I have to try my best not to
pull you into my arms and hug you and kiss you. When you are not around, it is
all I can do to not run to your apartment just so I can see you when you answer
the knock on your door. It is not fair, Himeko, you coming into my life and
turning it upside down without even trying.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Letting go of the lock of hair, Chikane sighed. Of all the
people in Mahoroba, of all the students in Ototachibana Academy, she just had
to fall in love with another girl. The sigh deepened. A girl who she was not
sure would love her back. Of course, Himeko really seemed to like Chikane the
way she acted around her but whether the girl harbored any romantic feelings
toward her was a different story. For all Chikane knew, Himeko might very well
have a panic attack and start to avoid her upon learning what dwelled in
Chikane’s heart. But then, the little angel never showed any sign that she
would object to being Chikane’s girlfriend anyway... so why should she not take
a chance?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Chikane’s hand moved to caress the other girl’s cheek as her
thoughts started to wander. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>What
chance do </span></i>you<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>
think I have, dear my precious angel? Would you reject me, or make me a part of
your life the way I want to be a part of yours? Would you spurn my feelings, or
return them and fulfill my one and only wish? What answer would </span></i>you<i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'> give, Himeko?</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Chikane-chan?” the sweet voice of the little angel said
quietly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Eyes opened wide in shock, Chikane found her own face an inch
above Himeko’s. Somehow, she had leaned over without even noticing it. And it
seemed... she was attempting to kiss the golden-haired girl... again. Every
molecule in her body rang in alarm. Himeko’s amethyst eyes, so shiny they would
dwarf the brightest diamond, were fixing at Chikane with a confused and
flustered look. The girl’s cheeks were coloring, making her look prettier and
cuter than ever. Chikane steeled herself and invoked every ounce of her
strength to make sure that she would not kiss the little angel by force.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I see you are well.” Chikane managed a brief smile on her
lips as she slowly drew her body back, attempting to hide the horror she was
feeling within. The way her voice maintained its coolness and certainty, she
seemed to have succeeded. “You have run a high fever the night before, so I was...”
she swallowed a little, “checking your temperature... with my forehead.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>A complete lie, but it was necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Ah...” Himeko said, pushing back the blanket as she, too,
sat up straight on the futon. Chikane blinked. For a second there, she thought
she glimpsed disappointment flashing across Himeko’s lovely face. Her heart
started to pound. What other answer had Himeko expected? What would she have
said if Chikane had told her the truth, if Chikane had revealed that she was
trying to kiss her? She glanced at the little angel, whose expression now
showed nothing but surprise as she looked around and realized that she had
woken up in a strange place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The golden-haired girl’s face paled a little. Unfamiliar
territory always scared her, of course. That raised an interesting point.
Himeko never showed the merest hint of nervousness when she stayed with Chikane
in the summer vacation house in Hokkaido. Why, she acted as though she had
grown up there the way she flitted around the house and did whatever she needed
to. Chikane filed the scrap of information away. It might mean something... or
it might not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Chikane gave herself a mental shake. She saw disappointment
only because she <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>wanted</span></i>
to. It had to be a figment of her imagination. Chikane almost sighed out loud.
Another side effect of being helplessly in love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Where are we, Chikane-chan?” Himeko asked, unease shining in
her beautiful eyes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Chikane gave the little angel an assuring smile, which the
girl returned in the most adorable way ever. Chikane’s breath caught.
Sometimes, she really wished Himeko would stop looking so cute. Did she not
know how dangerous it was to do so around someone who loved her so much she
could barely stop herself from going wild?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Shingetsu Daijinguu, Himeko,” Chikane said, wincing slightly
at the butterflies trouncing her stomach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The Grand Shrine of the Sacred Moon was the name of
Mahoroba’s spiritual stronghold. The three thousand-year-old structure –
largest of all the Shrines around the country, housing hundreds of Priests in
its numerous apartments – sat on the highest hill of the City and, as some
would put in a reverent way, watched over its citizens with the eyes of the
Gods. Even from the time its construction was finished, Shingetsu had always
been the place where the people aspired to and sought assistance. When calamity
struck Mahoroba, it was the Grand Shrine who extended its helping hand and
delivered people out of hardships. For that, the City itself was eternally
grateful. Or so the history textbooks claimed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Ah, Oogami-sensei’s house, ne?” the little angel pounded a
fist into her other hand, lips making a perfect O, showing her sparkling,
evenly arranged white teeth. If Chikane recalled correctly, Himeko brushed them
after waking up, before going to sleep, and between every meal during their
stay in Hokkaido. The girl would do any dentist proud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Yes.” Chikane nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Oogami-sensei</span></i>
was what the people respectfully called the High Priest Oogami Kazuki, the
Forty-sixth Leader of the ancient Oogami Clan, Master of Shingetsu, and elder
brother to Oogami Souma. The man was loved by most of those who lived in the
City, for he was kind, his personality warm, and his smile so comforting people
could not help but relax in his presence. Furthermore, the middle-aged High
Priest had always been the first to leave the Grand Shrine when trouble stirred
Mahoroba. A few years back, when a terrible winter plagued the City, Oogami
Kazuki himself had labored miles after miles to give out warm clothes and food
to the poor and the homeless. Afterwards, he became so stricken with pneumonia
that everyone worried he would pass away. Of course, such dedication moved
people’s heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Chikane could still remember the day she and her parents, the
famous and powerful Himemiya Kyou and Himemiya Kimika, knelt beside Oogami
Kazuki’s sick bed and wished him well. They had caused an uproar then. After
all, the C.E.O. and C.F.O. of Himemiya International, who spent most of their
time oversea meeting with the world’s most important leaders, had taken a
flight home just so they could visit a man who held no political or business
power. Every newspaper in town had displayed the picture of her Father shaking
the High Priest’s hand on the front page and spoken of it for days. Had it not
been for the incident, the public would have never known that her Mother was
Oogami Kazuki’s childhood friend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“But then, why am I in the Grand Shrine?” Himeko asked.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>“The High Priest <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>demanded
</span></i>that,” Chikane said wryly, “so there you have it.”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>She did not mention that the <i><span style='font-family:
"Footlight MT Light"'>order</span></i> of the man – who had stridden into the
school ground with a demeanor arrogant enough for any king – was not what she
agreed with. She had said <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>clearly</span></i>
to his <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>face</span></i> that
she did not <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>want</span></i>
to entrust Himeko to a bunch of <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>old
men </span></i>who never had a clue how to care for a <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>growing</span></i> <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>girl</span></i> properly. She had also
told Oogami Kazuki <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>firmly</span></i>
she would not put Himeko in the same place as his younger brother, who, as she
had kindly reminded the High Priest, bore the markings of a cold-blooded
murderer<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>.</span></i></p>

of the Himemiya Empire and found herself stared down at with the icy authority
of a man who refused to take <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>No</span></i>
for an answer. Strong as her willpower was, she still lost for she was
outnumbered by the coterie of underlings, namely the Shingetsu Priests he
brought along. Ironically enough, when Oogami Kazuki <i><span style='font-family:
"Footlight MT Light"'>suggested</span></i> to Chikane that he would take Himeko
to Shingetsu by force if need be, he had looked <i><span style='font-family:
"Footlight MT Light"'>nothing</span></i> like the kind-faced High Priest who
handed out warm clothes with a smile on the streets of Mahoroba. She suspected
that the man had at least two personalities, though.</p>

he will tell you soon enough. After all... he told me he wished to speak with
you as soon as you wake,” Chikane grimaced. Rousing a tired girl out of her bed
just because he wanted to talk? Maybe she would need to have a nice long chat
with him about his <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>treatment</span></i>
toward Himeko soon.</p>

the red and white Ototachibana uniform – carefully washed, thoroughly

High Priest wait for another twenty-four hours, actually. He deserved it.</p>

lain almost naked in front of the blue-haired princess. Himeko shivered. How

that would freeze hell over. “We are but normal high school girls <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>trying</span></i> to stay away from a
mad man who thinks he can take our lives and get away unpunished.” Himeko
swallowed uneasily. The way Chikane-chan said it, anyone would have thought
that the mad man was Oogami-sensei’s relative... or himself. Surprisingly
enough, the High Priest flinched as if goosed. Afterwards, he eyed her warily.
Himeko but wondered whether something had happened between the two of them when
she was still asleep.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>“Before I do that, I must tell you something,” Oogami-sensei
replied calmly. If he had lost his balance a few seconds ago, he got it back
now. “You see, the Grand Shrine have been protecting a secret for a long time,
a piece of dark history known to no mortal but the members of the Oogami Clan.”</p>

Oogami-san?” the Himemiya princess smiled again, this time much more coldly
than she did last, if that was possible. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>What
kind of secret is Oogami Souma, really?</span></i> Himeko thought.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>“From the beginning of time,” the High Priest continued
smoothly as though never interrupted. He did peer at Chikane-chan curiously,
though, perhaps wondering how he had offended her. “Unbeknownst to most, the
Immortals of Heaven walked the Earth. Disguised, they wandered the World of Men
to flee the boredom that came as the price of eternal life. At first, they were
just Gods and Goddesses who had too much time on their hands, completely harmless...
until they discovered the fun in toying with the people who spent their
ephemeral lifespan trying to bring food to the table. The Immortals then
started playing pranks on the poor people, which escalated to monstrous
atrocities in the end. There had been records that an anonymous God slaughtered
an entire village, men, women, <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>and</span></i>
children, just because he wanted to prove he could.”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“But that’s too cruel!” Himeko said, horrified. She had
always believed the Immortals were protectors of the world. It seemed
Yukihito-san shared the same sentiment as her, for the man’s face was a mask of
rage, his fists clenching so hard she thought they would bleed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Indeed,” Oogami-sensei nodded. “However, such tragedies were
brought to the attention of the Lord of Izumo and the Lady of Reiha, the two Makers
of the World. The Lord and the Lady, after a secret meeting, decided that the
Immortals must be reined in or Onogoro, the name given to the then Earth, would
face total destruction. They let it be known that a new Law was made, which
forbade all intervention from the Immortals to the Human World.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

text-indent:.5in'>“Everything, Himemiya-san, for that very law set the stage
for what happened in your school,” the High Priest said gravely. “It dated back
all the way to three thousand years ago, when the Immortals of Heaven sentenced
a God named Yamata no Orochi to <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>death</span></i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Very much so, yes,” the High Priest answered. “Yamata no
Orochi, who termed himself the Dark God of Blood and Destruction, refusing to
be killed at the hand of his people, fled to the Earth. Thanks to his skills in
persuasion, he succeeded in gathering a huge amount of worshippers, thus
building a large army upon this very land. None had had the power to stop him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

anything?”</p>

text-indent:.5in'>“It was not that they didn’t, Kurusugawa-san, they <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>obviously</span></i> couldn’t.”
Oogami-sensei barked a painful laugh. Himeko wished the man would not treat his
story as if common sense sometimes. She wondered if there was a way to ask him
what he meant without sounding extraordinarily stupid....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Because of Orochi’s worshippers, of course,” Chikane-chan
said, still looking coldly at Oogami-sensei. Yet, seeing how gentler the
princess’s voice had become, Himeko knew the explanation was meant for her.
Himeko smiled at her gratefully. “The Dark God had become a part of those
people’s lives. Dealing with Orochi meant intervening in the mortals’ business,
thus breaking the law set by the Makers earlier. Besides, I suspected that the
Dark God always kept his followers close so that he could use them as shields
should the Immortals come at him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You learn very quickly, Himemiya-san,” the High Priest’s
broad smile split his face into two. The princess, in return, favored him with
a frosty look. While another person in the High Priest’s place would have lost
his smile, Oogami-sensei’s refused to waver. A brave man....</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“The change of the tide, Kurusugawa-san,” the High Priest
said. “Seventeen years after the Dark God’s descent into Onogoro, hope was
given to mankind in the form of two Maidens, named the Priestesses of Kannazuki,
who were trained by the Immortals, who wielded enormous powers, who were able
to summon Orochi’s nemesis: <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>the
Sword God Ame no Murakumo</span></i>. On the Lunar Shine on the majestic Moon
the two lived, waiting for the day when they would rid the world of the menace
of the Orochi.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“And how may that concern Himeko?” Chikane-chan demanded. The
heat was back in her voice... but this time, there was also uneasiness and
fear. She probably had figured out why she and Himeko were summoned to this
place. “Why is it so important that you have to rouse her when she is still
tired from everything from the night before? Why?!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Because your friend, Kurusugawa Himeko, is the reincarnation
of one of the Kannazuki Priestesses, the Priestess of the Sun herself.” All
that was delivered by the High Priest in a level tone. His wariness toward the
blue-haired princess still lingered, though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Himeko stared at the sensei in shock, unable to say even a
word. But whatever she was feeling inside, the blue-haired princess voiced it
for her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Impossible,” Chikane-chan said icily, her sapphire eyes,
strong enough to drive nails into a wall, locked onto Oogami-sensei’s. Creases
formed on the middle-aged man’s forehead, and he looked as though he wanted to
break away from the princess’s intense gaze. Next to him, Yukihito-san gave a
wry chuckle. He seemed amused. “What part of <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>we
are but normal high school girls</span></i> do you <i><span style='font-family:
"Footlight MT Light"'>not</span></i> understand, Shingetsu High Priest?”
Chikane-chan made no attempt to move that Himeko could see, but she managed to
loom in the Grand Hall, her presence growing after every word she spoke.
Surprise dawned on the High Priest’s face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I have proof, Himemiya-san,” the sensei managed, turning to
Himeko. “My apology for such an inappropriate question, Kurusugawa-san, but do
you have any mark resembling the Sun on your body?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Chikane-chan’s gaze shifted to Himeko. By the time it
arrived, it was no longer so hard that it could crush a man. Those beautiful
eyes were sparking with a strange gentleness and affection that warmed her
heart. However, she realized what message the other girl was sending her. She
wanted Himeko to deny the existence of the mark. Perhaps she had not noticed it
when she changed Himeko’s clothes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I do,” she admitted reluctantly, and the blue-haired
princess sighed a sigh that tore at Himeko’s heart. She wanted to say what
Chikane-chan wished her to but the truth was still the truth. Besides, lying in
front of the one she loved wasn’t something she wanted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“If I am not mistaken, it did not appear before yesterday,
no?” The High Priest’s face was shining... with what seemed to be hope. On
contrary, though, only despair clouded that of the princess of the Himemiya.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“That mark is named the Sun Crest,” Oogami-sensei smiled
warmly at her, “the very proof that you are the Priestess of the Sun, other
than the fact that a Follower had attempted to remove you himself yesterday.”
The man clamped his mouth shut at the end of the sentence, appearing to have
realized that he had said what he should not have.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

wondered why.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I have told you that the Dark God had numerous worshippers
three thousand years ago,” the High Priest said, grief entering his voice.
“Most of them were peasants, many were lords, but they were still easy to deal
with. This time, it’s different. The best of the Council of Priests in Tokyo,
upon observing every turbulence in the Cycle of Death and Rebirth, had informed
the rest that eight humans, each endowed with the blessings of Yamata no Orochi
himself, had been born into this world. We called them the Eight Followers, Kurusugawa-san,
who boast powers no other human can dream of. Worse, since their minds are
plagued by the darkness of Orochi, they are hell-bent on destroying the Human
World. They are not different from demons... well, <i><span style='font-family:

them down years ago, yet when we finally captured one, it was almost too late.”</p>

manner, “my little brother is one of the Followers. Another one had named him

Himeko’s sympathy. “I assure you, he wasn’t aware of what he was doing. Please
understand, Kurusugawa-san, he never harbors any ill will toward anyone, least
of all, you.”</p>

lost on her, for an image already rising like a viper in her mind had all but
occupied her attention. Oogami Souma... was the one who attacked her in her own
room. He was the one with the dual-bladed sword, whose body was enveloped in an
eerie purple light. Memories returned to her like the waves of the ocean
crashing upon the beach in the heaviest storm. Now she remembered everything
from the night before, even the deep hatred she had seen in the boy’s scarlet
eyes, even the terrible heat of the light with which he had struck her.
Overwhelmed by the painful currents of images and sensation, she passed out. </p>

Oogami Kazuki with her acid comments just a moment ago. He tried not to laugh. <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Slaughtered</span></i>. He had been
High Priest for thirty years, and more often than not, commanded fear and
respect. This was the first time ever that someone, a teenaged girl at that,
bandied words with him and succeeded. Everything sure was changing.</p>

suddenly had a flash of déjà vu about her parents witnessing how softer and
gentler her gaze became during the heartbeat it swiveled from him to Himeko

text-indent:.5in'>“I believe we do,” Himemiya Chikane stood up, carrying
Kurusugawa Himeko in her arms while glancing imperiously at Kazuki. He
suppressed an amused chuckle. The night before, when Kazuki met her in
Ototachibana Academy and told her that he would take Himeko to Shingetsu by
hooks or by crooks, her transfixing sapphire gaze had caught him by surprise,
for he had never thought that someone in Mahoroba would resist a reasonable
suggestion from <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>the</span></i>
High Priest. Well, she didn’t just resist. She bloody told him flat out that
she would <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>not</span></i>
obey. Had he not brought his subordinates with him, he would have returned to
Shingetsu empty-handed. Had he realized what their relationship was at that
time, though, perhaps he could have found a way to bring Himeko to Shingetsu
instead of bullying Himemiya Chikane into it and subsequently making her look
like she wanted to kill him.</p>

bothered to ask for Kazuki’s leave like the rest of Mahoroba would. She had
stopped calling him ‘<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>sensei,</span></i>
also. Perhaps to her, he had become pretty much an eyesore that needed to be
removed, just like his younger brother. Kazuki sighed. He needed to set heavy
guards around Souma now. Not because Kazuki wanted to keep tab on him, of
course. He only wanted his brother to be <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>protected</span></i>.
When Himemiya Chikane <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>awakened</span></i>,
the boy, with or without Orochi powers, might not survive her wrath.</p>

Himeko opened her eyes, she was already back in the room where she had awoken

massaging her temple. When she tried to give her head a little shake to clear
the dizziness, her gaze fell upon a little piece of paper right where the
blue-haired princess once sat.</p>

Unlike the other words, flowing elegantly across the piece of paper, the last
two were written in such a sharp hand that had Chikane-chan pressed the tip of
her pen a little harder, perhaps she would have torn the sheet apart. Himeko
swallowed a rueful chuckle. Apparently, the princess had not thought of
Oogami-sensei any better. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“Stay

Outside was by no means more dangerous than in Shingetsu Grand Shrine, where an
Orochi Follower was being nursed back to health. She grimaced. She shouldn’t
have thought of Oogami Souma so. After all, Oogami-sensei had said that the boy
was not himself when he tried to... murder her. But then, who could say when he
would fall under the spell of the Dark God again? She shivered. She did not
intend to be near him when he did. She doubted luck would favor her a second

really, only the Gods could guess when the other girl would finish her <i><span

High Priest. For all she knew, they could be shouting at each other right at
this moment.... Besides, the blue-haired princess would insist on going with
Himeko for sure. Himeko didn’t want that. Chikane-chan – who accidentally let
slip that she had not gotten much sleep because she watched over Himeko the

corner of the front side, where her and Mako-chan’s room was, looked as though
blasted away by a small bomb. From there, cracks, huge and deep, ran all over
the place. All the windows had been thoroughly shattered, the white color of
the walls replaced with black soot. Himeko was under the impression that if
anyone poked the Dorm with just a finger, it might just go crumbling down.
Goosebumps rose on every inch her skin. If Oogami Souma could do this to a<i><span

The reason why she cried was Himeko. Stupid girl. She never understood Makoto’s
feelings. She didn’t even noticed how much Makoto loved her. She had no idea
that Makoto would do anything as long as she could make her smile.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>That evening, after Himeko forsook her hand in the
evacuation, Makoto had run against the current of students after her. She
hadn’t cared that her own life was in jeopardy. She only wanted Himeko safe and
sound. Ironically enough, she never made it back to her room. Somewhere along
the way, someone crashed into her and knocked her over just for the others to
trample on her leg. It had been the moment the darkness defeated her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Still, Makoto never regretted it. What she did, she did for
the sake of the one she loved. She was only sad because Himeko already had
someone <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>she</span></i> loved.
<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Himemiya Chikane.</span></i>
Himeko was a clueless and simple girl at best. She had no idea that Makoto read
her as easily as she would a book. Himeko’s flustered expression when she saw
Himemiya, the fond looks she sent after the blue-haired princess’s back, none
escaped Makoto’s eyes. The girl never learned that when she opened her drawers
at night and took out her precious hidden treasure, Makoto was still awake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>When it happened the first time, Makoto was merely puzzled,
for she didn’t know what Himeko was up to so late at night watching a picture
album. Yeah, she wasn’t particularly interested during the first several
seconds... until the loveliest smile lit up her friend’s reddened face. Himeko
never smiled like that to Makoto. Nor did she ever blush. That night, Makoto
had learned firsthand the bitter taste of jealousy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The day after, Makoto stood in the room in front of the table
after Himeko had already gone out. She then picked the lock with her hairpin.
In five minutes, the album came into her grasp. It was even more excruciating
than she expected. By time she flipped past the last page, Makoto was already
crying non stop. Himeko had never been so happy around her, never so cheerful
and energetic. That fact alone hurt enough to kill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Of course Makoto knew the affection her roommate had for her
was never more than that of a friend. She only didn’t want to acknowledge it as
truth. More than that, she had gone as far as forcing herself to believe that
one day, Himeko would realize that Makoto would sacrifice everything for her
sake. Every day Makoto waited. Every moment she woke, she wished Himeko would
come to her and tell her she loved her. Had life been fair, that little wish
would have come true. Had the Immortals of Heaven known what was best for the
golden-haired girl, Himemiya Chikane would have dropped dead.</p>

Makoto stood no chance in winning the golden-haired girl over. Himeko’s eyes
only saw Himemiya Chikane’s figure, her head only contained Himemiya Chikane’s
images, and her ears only heard Himemiya Chikane’s words. Makoto had tried to
disabuse her roommate’s hope that she could have Himemiya – once right after
Makoto found a devastatingly blissful expression Himeko in Himemiya’s embrace –
but try as she might, she never succeeded.</p>

staying near Himeko, or even in living, any longer. She had lost her roommate,
the only meaning she believed this world had, the only present she thought life
had meant for her. If only Makoto had died on the night they broke her leg....</p>

search for someone in the dark within a city of millions, many of whom would
not be gentle to a pretty girl found in their midst. Chills wrecked her body. <i><span

found herself looking at a slender young woman as tall as she, only prettier.
Chikane knew that she was blessed with good looks not many people had but were
she to stand next to this woman, she would barely be noticeable. Chikane could
even feel the whole room quiet down, every eye, men’s and women’s alike,
shifting toward the newcomer. The nurse at the reception desk was staring at
her – hands on her mouth, eyeballs about to leap off her sockets – as though
seeing an angel on Earth.</p>

seemed to shine with an aura that put the fluorescent light on the ceiling to

could not help wanting to dwell herself in them forever. In a long-sleeved,
high-collared snowy coat and a pair of casual denim jeans, the woman lit up the
waiting room of the hospital the way the sun illuminated the world. Chikane had
never met such a person before, yet somehow, she seemed awfully familiar.</p>

towards the doors. When she stopped and looked back, however, the woman was gone.
The nurse was back to hammering the keyboard of her computer with her sausage
fingers, eyes glued on the monitor’s screen. The other people waiting in the
room either paced its length in worry or read a newspaper. They all gave no
impression that a woman had just graced them with her stunning presence.
Chikane shivered. They were acting as though the woman never existed.</p>

help, he defeated the damned woman of the Orochi who forced him to attacked
Kurusu..., no, Himeko, the love of his life. Orochi.... Disgust stirred his

himself.</p>

God of Blood Destruction. Shortly after regaining his consciousness, he had
wanted to die when his nii-san told him the truth. The Eight Followers of
Orochi had been awakened by the Dark God’s call, as was he. He had been taught
since childhood and he was meant to protect the people he loved but with the
darkness within him, there was no telling when he would reemerge as a
bloodthirsty monster. After yesterday, he had realized that the will power he
was ever so proud of was just as fragile as a piece of glass.</p>

forgive himself. He was indeed a monster, one that needed to be put down as
soon as possible.</p>

looking at him curiously. Like a bird peering at a worm, Souma would say. But
certainly, the man was an Orochi just as Souma was.</p>

saw in her life... it would still be enough. Perhaps it was no river with
treacherous currents powerful enough to sweep her away... it should still be
enough....</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Himeko rose to her feet and walked toward the pool, her mind
strangely calm, her head completely empty except for the little voice that had
been telling her to step quicker. She guessed it meant she was doing the right
thing. She hoped she was.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The swimming pool itself sat next to a small building only
one-story high, both carefully fenced against trespassers. Fortunately for her
– or perhaps unfortunately, she couldn’t decide which in this state of mind –
there was an opening, a gate that should have been locked but was left ajar,
allowing her the access to the small body of water, where she hoped would be
her final resting place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Under the assault of the cold, endless rain, she treaded upon
the steps that led her deeper and deeper into the pool. Freezing water, only
brushing against her feet at first, slowly reached her waist, her chest, and
eventually, her neck. Then it engulfed her whole. In what seemed to be longer
than a century, Himeko hung within the black water, feeling it pressing against
her body, stinging against her eyes, blocking her nose, flooding her mouth, and
streaming down her throat. Darkness consumed her vision, nothingness occupied
her mind, and a horrible cramp wrecked her whole self apart. It was painful, it
made her want to flail her arms and feet desperately to swim to the surface. Yet
even if she obeyed the urge to live, she couldn’t, for she wasn’t able to move
even her fingertips. Thus Himeko continued to sink into the depth, wondering
where she would go once she had passed into the afterlife.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>It turned out that she would never be able to know that, for
when she could open her eyes again, she found her arms wrapping around
someone’s neck, her head resting against someone’s shoulder, and her body being
carried around in that someone’s arms. Next she knew, she was sitting against a
wall of a room brightly lit by the fluorescent tubes hanging on its ceiling,
breathing weakly while looking at an anxious Chikane-chan, whose blue hair was
matted to her face, whose clothes were soaking wet. The princess must have been
the one who brought Himeko out of the water and saved her life. Himeko just
wanted to weep. It seemed she couldn’t stay away from the one she loved whether
she intended to or not.</p>

“Look at you, you are shaking. What in goodness’s name could you be doing in

off abruptly at that, but both of them knew full well what she meant. <i><span

the princess drifting away, the screeching sounds of metal doors opening and
closing as though the other girl was rummaging through every locker there was
in the room, and finally her footfalls back toward Himeko. Her eyes sprang open
when something soft and fuzzy fell upon her head. It was a bath towel, with
which Chikane-chan used to start drying Himeko’s hair.</p>

princess, sapphire eyes gazing straight ahead while her hand deftly wiping away
the water, their noses all but touched. Had Himeko been able to move a muscle
on her body, she would have thrown herself against Chikane-chan, attempted to
kiss her forever, and dignity be hanged. She didn’t think she would be able to
contain her desire when the face of the one she loved was so close, when her
warm, fragrant breaths continued to brush upon her nose and her cheeks.</p>

off the red silk bow with which she used to tie her hair together. Once the bow
safely lay upon the carpeted floor, the princess’s soft hands quietly moved to
unbutton the Ototachibana sleeveless red jacket, then the white shirt beneath
it. Goosebumps rose over Himeko’s skin as the other girl’s pulled the sodden
piece of clothing down, exposing to the cold air Himeko’s shoulders, then her
upper body, naked except for the bra covering her modest chest. Her face burned
in embarrassment as she heard a sharp intake of breath from the blue-haired
girl. She had thought she wanted to see Chikane-chan’s expression while
undressing her. She now knew that she wouldn’t... not when she thought her
heart would burst from merely being <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>aware</span></i>
of what the princess was doing to her. As the other girl took the wet skirt and
her stockings off, she used all the strength she had to turn her head away and
prevented a gasp from escaping her lips.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

her hands sliding soundlessly under Himeko’s arms and reaching toward Himeko’s
back. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“A steamy embrace”</span></i>
was the only thing she could call it. The princess’s front all but pressed
against hers, the Himemiya Ojou-sama’s chin but rested on her left shoulder,
the other girl’s blue and wet hair but matted to her cheek. The cold fingertips
of the princess, fumbling around the clasp of Himeko’s bra and fluttering
against her skin, constantly sent lightning-powerful shivers rippling through
her every nerve. Face suffused with blood, Himeko’s teeth rounded on her tongue
to stop herself from whimpering aloud. And it didn’t prepare her in the least
bit when the other girl removed her underwear. Himeko was so glad that the heat
she felt had not cooked her alive after the cotton piece of cloth had been
slipped off her legs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I...” Chikane-chan mumbled, tossing Himeko’s underwear to
the pile. “I do not have a choice, Himeko. I cannot leave you wearing wet
clothes so. You will get sick,” she said, sounding as though she was pleading
for Himeko’s sympathy, as though she had done something very wrong. In a way,
she had. Himeko would prefer being sick for a year to being undressed by the
one she loved, the one who she didn’t know would love her back. A discordant
thought stirred her mind. If she knew Chikane-chan loved her, would she still
feel this way when the princess took off her clothes?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

now completely naked for all to see, against the left side her own, her left
hand placed primly on Himeko’s shoulder, her right hand holding the bath towel
with which she had used to dry Himeko’s hair and face. A lump of something rose
in Himeko’s throat. The other girl meant to do the same to the rest of her body
as well, she realized. Despite not being able to move, she flinched. Himeko bit
her lips harder. How was she going to stop Chikane-chan from what she was going
to do short of revealing her true feelings?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

out. The most sensual torture in the world had already started.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Before, during the undressing, Himeko had tried her hardest
to ignore the other girl’s electric touches. Now... despite the aid of the bath
towel separating Chikane-chan’s palm and Himeko’s skin, she could no longer
pretend that she didn’t feel a thing. The Himemiya Ojou-sama’s hands trailed
slowly from Himeko’s neck to her shoulders, then down her upper arms, forearms,
and her every fingertip, sparing not even a drop of water. It was gentle, it
was kind, it was truly like a caress one might give her lover... but it was at
the same time the most nerve-racking thing on earth. In her soul, stark desire
was rising. Beneath her skin, a flame of passion was burning her whole. In her
mind, the voice of reason clashed with a much stronger one, which seemed to
stem from her love for the blue-haired princess. Thoughts whirled more
violently than any maelstrom, most of which were so indecent and embarrassing
that Himeko would not tell a soul even on her deathbed. Her heart was racing
faster than any horse, her veins pulsing as though the blood inside was trying
to break out, and her head brimming with enough heat to reduce steel to dust.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Her mind went blank when the princess’s hand traveled to her
chest, flicked past the heaving mounds and the valley between them so it could
get to her belly. Her whole body was rigid with fright and pleasure, the latter
overwhelming the former. Her heart simply stopped, her head giving the
impression it was going to explode from the torturous sensation. When the towel
moved past her belly button and reached the part where her lower body joined
with her thighs, the fatigue, the cold, and the feelings in her heart caught up
with her. Darkness claimed Himeko.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Some time later, Himeko wasn’t sure how long, she woke up in
a bathrobe the front of which was tied together at her waist by a sash. She was
sitting against the wall again, next to the Himemiya Ojou-sama, in the same
getup. At the sight of the one she loved, the memories of the undressing came
alive in her mind, stronger than ever. She really didn’t know what to say to
the blue-haired princess now.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

painted with relief. She leaned sideways toward Himeko, the princess’s slender
shoulder brushing against hers. Himeko gave a start, hastily scurried away from
the other girl until an arm’s length separated their bodies. She blushed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I guess,” Himeko muttered, fully aware of both the relief
and the disappointment in her voice. Relief she could understand, but
disappointment? Heat flared in her cheeks. Maybe she wanted the other girl to
touch her again....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I cannot tell how glad I am to hear that.” Chikane-chan
laughed softy. “I do not wish to do that ever again. I mean, the way you
reacted when I was taking off your wet clothes, I thought I was deflowering
you.” The laughter died, and the blue-haired girl snapped her mouth shut with
an audible click of her teeth. Himeko studied the carpeted floor, face growing
hotter by the minute. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Yes,” Himeko answered briefly, still not looking at the one
she loved. She wrapped her arms around her knees, hugging them tight. Every
single inch of her body... the princess had seen.... Every single inch of it
she had also touched.... The neck she stroked, the shoulder she caressed, the
fingers she entwined, the breasts she gently cupped and dried... they were all
but engraved with her warmth. Until the end of time, Himeko doubted her body
would forget the memory of the princess’s tender attention, and the feelings
she had wrought. She couldn’t tell whether it was a blessing the Gods had given
her, or just a curse. Heaving a sigh, she decided on the blessing. What was
done, was done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'> A loud sound suddenly thundered in the distance, and the
fluorescent light went out. Himeko expected the darkness to descend from the
ceiling, yet it didn’t. The large chamber only became a little dimmer, for the
moon was shining through the glass windows of the locker room, spreading its
gentle shadow upon her, Chikane-chan, and a large piece of the carpet. The rain
had stopped, the clouds cleared, leaving a sky reigned by the silver crescent
and the countless stars attending it like nobles would a queen in her court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

not know where the switch for the heater is, and I do not dare leave you here
all by yourself.”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I’m fine, Chikane-chan,” a second sneeze came, immediately
followed by a third, and a fourth. Dizziness hit Himeko, moisture struck the
inside of her nose, and a terrible cold crept onto her flesh. The world seemed
to sway around her while her whole body shivered as though sitting naked in the
heart of winter. Couldn’t help herself, Himeko ran her hands up and down her
arms, hoping that it would warm her up. It didn’t help.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

her hand upon the piece of carpet in-between. “It will be better if we sit
close to each other.” Himeko’s breath caught.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Very well.” The Himemiya princess smiled. “But we will not
have to endure it for too long, though. I have made a call to my chauffer and
told him to return to my house so he could bring us new clothes. He will be
here any moment.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>After that, the two of them sat in silence, the other girl
gazing up at the crescent moon. Himeko ground her teeth together lest they
clatter and hugged herself tightly to prevent it from trembling. When she stole
a surreptitious glance at the princess, though, she noticed that the girl was
in a condition no better than hers. Pale and bloodless, the Himemiya
Ojou-sama’s face stood out even in the moonlight. Her lips were so dry they
clearly showed the cracks. Her nose every once in a while would issue a spray
of mist that faded into the air almost instantly. It was the first time Himeko
realized that her Chikane-chan wasn’t so strong-willed she could overcome any
obstacle and that she, too, was only a girl Himeko’s age, a girl who was just
as vulnerable to the harshness of nature. The princess, whose body only was
covered by only a flimsy bathrobe, was being chilled to the bone.</p>

Because Chikane-chan wanted to save Himeko, she had had to dive into that
freezing pool and become like this. It was Himeko’s fault.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>That was how she found her back leaning against the front of
the one she loved about thirty seconds later. Yet, she never expected
Chikane-chan’s right hand to slip under her right arm and placed itself on
Himeko’s left shoulder while her other arm encircled Himeko’s waist and hugged
her tight. The princess’s chin was propped on her right hand, their cheeks more
than just touched. The way she held Himeko, she seemed to be afraid that Himeko
would go somewhere and leave her forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Her heart once again picked up its pace. Ever since the first
embrace the blue-haired princess gave her in the Garden of the Roses, she had
always wanted another. In fact, her innate shyness and the fear that
Chikane-chan would discover her feelings were the only things that kept her
from hugging the girl every time they met. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>But
tonight should be okay, shouldn’t it?</span></i> she thought. If they were just
keeping each other warm, Chikane-chan probably wouldn’t suspect that Himeko was
head over heels in love with her. Quietly, Himeko put her own hands upon that
of the blue-haired princess, which was placed on the hollow of Himeko’s waist.
The blue-haired girl gave no evidence that she minded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>It seemed the close body contact was helping Chikane-chan as
well, for her cheek and hands, cold as ice in the beginning, were warming up,
her breathing stabilizing. Which eventually reminded Himeko that the girl’s
firm, ample bosom was rising and falling against her back. Chikane-chan would
be offended to know this but... she felt really nice. Blood raced to Himeko’s
cheeks. She was having dirty thoughts again....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

text-indent:.5in'>“What were you doing in that pool?” the princess repeated the
question she had asked before. Only this time, Himeko found words waiting to
pour from her lips. Strangely enough, death no longer seemed so attractive when
she was indulged in the tenderness of Chikane-chan’s heart-warming embrace. She
doubted <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>anything</span></i>
was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Slowly, Himeko told her the reasons. Well, most of them. She
kept back the part about the despair that Himeko couldn’t be with her anymore.
She didn’t know what Chikane-chan could make out from that piece of knowledge
but since the princess was a very smart girl, Himeko wouldn’t risk it. And of
course, she didn’t tell her crush about the little voice urging her to walk
into the pool either. She doubted she wanted the other girl to think of her as
someone who heard <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>voices</span></i>.</p>

girl to shout at her. Chikane-chan never did. Instead, her arms tightened
around Himeko’s body as much as they could without hurting her.</p>

murmured, and Himeko turned her head to look at the other girl. “I only wish I
could take your pain and make you feel better.” Her words were simple, yet the
sincere anguish in her voice, the affectionate light in her sapphire eyes spoke
more than she ever could. Himeko was moved.</p>

turned toward the door of the locker room. There, a handsome and slender young

slithered down Himeko’s spine. When did he arrive? Why didn’t she hear
anything?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

pointing at the Himemiya Ojou-sama. “As for the Sun Priestess, she can go drown
herself for all I care.” Then it struck Himeko.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“That is correct,” the man nodded. “Thanks to little Suikyou
here,” he stroked the hilt of his sword almost lovingly. “I was able to give
you a few... suggestions.”</p>

text-indent:.5in'>“Thank you,” Tokiya laughed, seemingly pleased at the insult.
“And to show my appreciation, I will demonstrate what this Water Blade of mine

Tokiya laughed harder when he saw the Sun Priestess fall down upon the floor
and lay flat on her stomach. What a weakling.... She didn’t even have the
strength to resist Suikyou’s mind-controlling power. Tokiya had always found
this kind of girl quite revolting, fools who did not even deserve to live. That
was why he never hesitated in giving her the subtle order to go drown herself
in the swimming pool. Too bad she survived. She wouldn’t be for much longer, of
course. He was well aware that this went against the wish of the Lord Orochi,
who ordered the Followers this very morning not to harm a hair on a Priestess’s
head, but if he could <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>suggest</span></i>
that the girl jump into the water again, it wouldn’t be too much of a problem.
After all, if it was she who committed suicide, the Lord couldn’t really blame
Tokiya for not following his command.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Well, Tokiya would deal with the disgusting girl later, after
he had done what he wanted with the Priestess of the Moon herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Himemiya Chikane, on her knees on the carpeted floor, was
hugging herself and trembling. The girl was fighting Suikyou’s powers with all
she had. Tokiya smiled appreciatively. She was strong indeed. Just the type of
girls that he liked. And it really helped that she was strikingly good-looking,
one of the few precious gems that the human world had ever been able to
produce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Stop that,” Tokiya said, more and more of his powers flowing
into Suikyou the Water Blade and ultimately ended up in the girl’s mind. The
Priestess went absolutely still at his command. Time to enjoy this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Strip,” he said and smiled in satisfaction upon seeing the
girl’s hands moving toward the sash on her waist. His smile slid off his lips,
however, when those delicate hands dropped to her sides... and when he sensed a
presence of power behind his back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Who’s there?” Tokiya spun around, swinging Suikyou in a
broad arc. From the tip of the sword, a thin blade of water emerged, slashing
at the wall he was facing. Without a slightest noise, a rectangle part of the
wall collapsed outward and broke itself upon the ground. What it left behind
was a hole large enough for four or five people to walk through at the same
time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Under the light of the moon, upon the surface of the calm
swimming pool a dozen feet away from Tokiya, in a hagoromo white as falling
snow, a woman stood. She was even more beautiful than the Priestess herself,
with her silver hair falling in a straight stream all the way to her feet, with
a face that would make any man look twice, with a pair of silver eyes no other
woman on Earth had. Being the lecherous man he was, Tokiya would have
approached her and attempted to make her kneel at his feet... had he not sensed
the power surging within her. Fright wrecked his body. In the name of the Lord,
he had never seen someone so strong! Were all the Followers to combine their
strength together, they would still be as weak as a child compared to the
woman.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You chose the worst person to pick on, Girochi Tokiya,” the
Priestess of the Moon spoke behind him, her voice no longer what it used to be.
It was icy, it was calm and collected, it was contemptuous, and it was
powerful! The girl was on her feet now, looking at him with her shining
sapphire eyes. “For that, you shall pay,” Himemiya Chikane continued, speaking
at the same time that the lips of the silver-haired woman moved. He suddenly
understood. The woman was controlling her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Himemiya Chikane’s hand rose so quickly that before Tokiya
had time to react, her palm was already erected in front of his chest. An
invisible wave struck him and hurled him all the way to the edge of the pool.
When his back slammed upon the concrete ground, he felt as though every bone in
his body had been shattered to pieces.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Pitiful creature of the dark,” the Priestess of the Moon,
towering over him, said in disgust. She was clad only in a bathrobe, but she
still looked a queen on her best day. The young girl lifted her hand again. This
time, Tokiya did not think she would let him live.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Reacting at the speed of lightning, he ground Suikyou’s tip
onto the ground, used it as a lever to rise to his feet, and lunged himself at
the silver-haired woman. She was the puppet master... she needed to be
eliminated first. Yet, he missed. The woman never twitched a muscle that Tokiya
could see, but her body glided away from him so fast that in a blink of an eye,
she was already at the other end of the pool while he still suspended in the
air, his sword dashing forward. Frighteningly, although the woman’s feet rest
entirely on the water, she didn’t make a smallest ripple. Tokiya was shocked.
With Suikyou’s power, he, too, could walk any water surface but such swift
movement was beyond him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>His second shock came when Himemiya Chikane appeared right
where the woman stood. Since he never wanted to kill her, he tried to withdraw
the sword. He was too late, for the girl’s index and middle finger had already
clamped upon either side of Suikyou’s blade. The third shock all but destroyed
his confidence the very moment he realized not only was he unable to move his Sword,
he neither could the rest of his body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Fool,” the Priestess said again in her eerie voice. “Even
the complete Suikyou could never harm my sleeve, much less half of it. You
overestimate yourself by a thousand times, little shadow of the Orochi Third
Head.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Tokiya was dumbfounded. The women knew that what he was
wielding was just one half of the true Suikyou the Water Blade, and he but a
mirror image of the real Orochi Third Head. She was aware that Suikyou
possessed the power to control water, the human mind, and the ability to make a
copy of anything on Earth, including its own self and master. Which was exactly
what he had made it do. Tokiya wanted to kill the Seventh Head to avenge his
Aneki’s humiliating defeat but he was afraid of Raien. Well, he did not exactly
fear the destructive power of the Lightning Blade – his Suikyou was strong
enough to protect him – but Raien’s horrifying <span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Voice
of Sorrow<i>, </i></span>which was able to suppress any magical forces within
its range.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Coming into contact with Raien meant all of Suikyou’s powers
sealed off and himself weakened considerably. Yet, there was something he could
take advantage of. Unknown to others, he had witnessed the fight between his
Aneki Miyako and Oogami just to notice that the boy was but an ignorant lout
who completely depended on Raien’s awesome power to do his bidding. Unlike
Tokiya, who had mastered the skills of the sword, Oogami could barely keep the
blade from stabbing his own foot! That was why Tokiya invoked Suikyou’s Mirror
Reflection to divide himself into two halves, one contained all his swordsman’s
skills and the other his magical powers. He was confident that with the
swordsmanship alone, he could kill Oogami and claimed Raien for his Aneki while
his other self finished off the Priestesses, thus eliminating the Lord’s one
and only threat. It was a foolproof plan, he knew it was, but he made one major
miscalculation. Who could have thought the girl had such a powerful ally?</p>

hand rose one last time and placed itself on Tokiya’s head. “May you never find
peace in your death.” Silver aura blazed.</p>

Yue put little Chikane and Himeko back into the position they were in before
the little worm of the Orochi showed himself. With a flicker of her hand, the
moonlight materialized into the rectangle opening on the wall and made it whole
once more.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>“Farewell, dearest children of mine,” Yue murmured to the
unconscious girls, kissing each of them slightly on their cheeks. Then she put
her hands on their foreheads and erased any bit of memory concerning the Orochi
Third Head. The despicable insect would not be able to bother the two girls
with his mind-control trick now that Yue had placed a little barrier in their
souls. Yes, they were now safe....</p>

Himemiya princess said while stroking Himeko’s head gently. “I am someone who
will fight by your side and keep you out of harm’s way. There is no need for
you to avoid me, at all. In fact, I would like you to come live with me from
now on.”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

text-indent:.5in'>“He does not have any say in this,” Chikane-chan laughed
quietly, hand combing through the fountain of Himeko’s hair. The satisfied
twinkling in the princess’s eyes gave Himeko the impression that the other girl
had succeeded in bending the High Priest to her will. Oogami-sensei wouldn’t
have been very pleased at this, she guessed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

unhappy about moving in with me?”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“No, I’m just too happy to say anything, Chikane-chan,”
Himeko murmured, burying her head in the princess’s chest. To live with the one
she loved, to see her anytime Himeko wanted to, to go to school with her every
morning.... It was like a dream come true.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Several minutes later, Chikane-chan’s chauffer arrived at the
swimming pool with new clothes for them to change into. Himeko was a little
disappointed, for she had to leave the princess’s embrace, but when she found
herself sitting next to the blue-haired girl in the limousine, nothing but
bliss remained in her head. She had a new home now, where she hoped she could
spend the rest of her days with the one she loved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>Standing
on top of the small building, Oogami Souma watched as Himemiya and Himeko got
into the car. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Chikane-chan?
Himeko?</span></i> he thought wonderingly. Those two never addressed each other
like that in school before. They were all Miya-sama this and Kurusugawa-san
that as far as he could remember. Besides, he did not think he saw them
together more than once.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>In any case, Himemiya’s fan girls would go haywire once they
learned their Miya-sama was this intimate with someone not from their own
crowd. Well, Souma felt the same way, although for a much different reason.
Their relationship seemed <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>out
of place</span></i>, he could sense something wrong with it. They looked the
best of friends but there was something much more than that. Upon acquiring
Orochi’s power, he had become more sensitive to humans’ emotion than anyone
ever could. He could tell when someone was angry or happy or sad even if their
faces were carved from rocks. And what he sensed from Himemiya Chikane and
Himeko was... disturbing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;
margin-bottom:.15in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Well, he
would deal with that eventually, just like what he did with the bastard
Girochi. There was one thing Souma could not deny, though. The man was too good
with his sword. When Souma lured Girochi out of the Grand Shrine and into the
forest, he had thought it was an easy fight. Wrong. It was dangerous because
Souma had been forced to defend himself most of the time. He didn’t even have
time to wield Raien’s powers. Every strike Girochi made connected with the next
into one continuous flow, aiming for Souma’s vital spots. It was like standing
beneath a waterfall, actually, with water thundering down from overhead. Every
time the blades met, sparks flew and Souma’s arms suffered an aftershock strong
enough to blow his sword away had he not gripped it with all his strength.
There was one time when he managed a counterattack and pushed Girochi back. At
that moment, he unleashed Raien’s powers and tried to kill the bastard but the
man dodged it easily. That attack cleared out a large area of the forest and
destroyed the power lines leading to the City just for nothing. After that,
Girochi resumed his onslaught. Eventually Souma realized it was a fight he
could not win.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>When he was about to let go of Raien because his hands were
numb from all the attacks, something unexpected happened. Girochi suddenly
coughed off a lot of blood as his sword broke into two. The man fell to the
ground and lay there, thrashing in pain. Seizing the opportunity, Souma once
again tapped into Raien’s lightning power and burned the bastard to dust.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>After the fight, Souma used Raien to traverse space to hurry
toward the Priestesses. It was another gift he was bestowed upon, sensing the
presences of the Priestesses of Kannazuki. If the Orochi had made his move,
only the Gods knew what they could have done to the girls when Souma was busy.
Nothing happened to them, though. Actually, he thought something <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>did</span></i> between them, but Souma
was too late to learn what.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Looking at the departing car, Souma tapped his lips
thoughtfully. It could be troublesome, now that Himemiya had invited Himeko to
live with her, troublesome for Souma, obviously. From what he could make out
after reading their emotions, Himemiya had a lot of hidden feelings for Himeko,
as did the girl he liked. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Troubling,
indeed,</span></i> Souma thought as he opened a Dimensional Portal leading him
back to Shingetsu. He froze a second before he stepped into the thing, though,
for his enhanced eyesight caught a small object sparkling beneath an oak tree
about a hundred feet away. At a flicker of his sword, the thing lifted from the
earth and flew into his hand. It was a pretty present box gift-wrapped
carefully in silver foil. More, on its top, there was a note that read, <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“Happy Birthday, Chikane-chan”</span></i>.
A cold hand gripped his heart once he used his power to learn what was inside
the thing.</p>

Orochi boy walked into the Dimensional Portal, face aghast, Yue, whose back was
leaning against another oak tree near the pool, taps her lips thoughtfully. A
turn of event she did not foresee. The boy seemed to follow the path of the
Light now, only that he never did it for the sake of the world. He did what he
did because of Himeko. What would happen if in the end he could not have what
he had been fighting for? No matter, he did not pose that great a threat to the
girls when they got each other’s back. The cogs of fate had already begun to turn,
grinding everything in its path. She had done everything in her power to stop
what would come to pass but whether the tragedy would repeat itself or not
really depended on the two poor girls themselves. Sometimes she wondered how
reality could be so cruel....</p>

let alone the most important one Law of Heaven, Yue-chan,” Yui said, seemingly
materializing out of thin air. Under the silvery light of the moon, she seemed
as glorious as the sun itself. “You’re aware father would not be pleased should
he know you intervened, aren’t you?”</p>

spare the resplendent woman a look. “Ao... I mean, Chikane was the person who
chased that little insect away, not me.”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“How about you?” Yue rounded on the other woman, her voice
would do an ice cube proud. “You revealed yourself in a crowd of <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>mortals</span></i> to show Chikane the
way, then erased their memory. You are no better than I am.”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Oh, something like that happened?” Yui said, feigning
ignorance. “Why didn’t I remember?”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>When Yue was ready to say something scathing to the
golden-haired woman, she stopped short. A Dimensional Portal opened several
feet away from both of them, from which emerged a man in a white cape whose
sleeves were decorated with a golden pentagram at the wrists. A Holy Messenger.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;
margin-bottom:.15in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>“I beg
your pardon, Yui-sama, Yue-sama,” The man bowed to them. Yue almost gnashed her
teeth. Those irritating people somehow managed to find her wherever she went
and did their best to see that she never had a moment’s peace. “The Lord wished
to see you. He is not pleased right now, so I suggest you come with me in haste.”
Shivers slid down Yue’s back. How did father learn of this so quickly?</span></p>

you?” Yui said, striding toward the Portal but before she entered, she added.
“But I see that you never stop disliking me after these years.” The woman
vanished into the gate, a smile decorating her lips.</p>
