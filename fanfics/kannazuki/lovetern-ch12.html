text-indent:.5in'>Standing on the rocky ground of the moon with her eyes closed
and her arms raised to her sides in a straight line, Kurusugawa Himeko
tightened her grip around the Eyes of Heaven as much as she could before she
invoked all the powers she possessed as the Priestess of the Sun. Godly strength
raced from the deepest corners of her heart, surged along every fiber of her
existence, and arrived at Kagetsuki and Akatsuya, which sucked them in like
whirlpools would water. When she had given them enough, she opened her eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Golden light, which was fanning out like the ocean waves from
under HimekoÅfs feet, lifted her up into the starlit sky. Although the air of
the moon was terribly cold already, it became even more so as its wind slashed
at her face as though wanting to tear her skin apart. To her left was the blue
Earth riding high above the horizon of the deserted Moon. To her right, the
distant golden sphere that had been burning bright since the beginning of the
ages. Hundreds of feet below her lay the remains of the Lunar Shrine, once her home
three thousand years ago. What was now just a heap of wood and stones had been
where her previous incarnation, Kannazuki Akari, used to spend the first
seventeen years of her life with the one she loved most. Much further down, way
beneath the dry crust of the sacred Moon, was the Sword GodÅfs Seal, Ame no
MurakumoÅfs concealed Dimensional Prison, and what she was going to break.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Her gaze fell upon the Eye of Aurora in her right hand then
traveled to the Eye of Luna on her left, upon which it stayed while she sensed
her hand tense around the KagetsukiÅfs hilt and felt her heart ache. It was her
beloved princessÅfs possession, designed for her and her alone. Himeko was but
aware that in her own hand, Kagetsuki would never be able to draw its power
from the moon and unleash its fearsome might the way the Himemiya heiress had. She
did not need it, in any case. What she was aiming for was the Eye of LunaÅfs
ability to reconstruct itself into any magical weapon that she needed it to.
That alone would suffice, for it would grant Himeko enough strength to
accomplish the suicidal plan that had dawned upon her when Oogami-sensei showed
her the secret manuscripts of the Oogami Clan.</p>

had rolled out the manuscript, she began to read its content. Upon the silken
surface were lines after lines of neatly and stylishly written scripts that
told her the true reasons why the Eyes of Heaven were forged. One of them she
already knew. The other she never thought possible.</span></i></p>

text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>First and
foremost, Akatsuya and Kagetsuki were made to summon Ame no Murakumo by using
the undefiled blood and untainted life force of a Priestess to disable the
Thirteen Seals and open up the Core Sphere that kept the Sword God bound. Once
he was free, the surviving Priestess were to use her own Eye of Heaven to seize
control over his mind, make him pick up the other Eye, and force him to destroy
the Dark God. And that was where the second purpose to the creation of the swords
came into the picture.</span></i></p>

text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>The
manuscript mentioned that Yamata no Orochi was in truth not the eight-headed
dragon that the folklores and ancient texts always portrayed. The Dark GodÅfs
real name, it revealed, was Sei no Tsurugi no Rinne the Seraphim Blade. To her
surprise, she learned that the true form of humanityÅfs greatest enemy was a
crystal sword which could control the eight elements of nature at will. As
such, he was inarguably one of the strongest swords ever made and might not be
easy to defeat even when the Sword God had been freed and armed with an Eye of
Heaven.</span></i></p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>With that
in mind, the Immortals gifted the Eyes the power to shapeshift into any magical
weapon they had analyzed beforehand. In so doing, they had made it possible to
the wielder of a True Key of Awakening to have it temporarily changed into the
sword form of the Seraphim Blade itself and gain a considerable advantage in
the battle to defend the world.</span></i></p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Troubled,
she put the manuscript back on the wooden tray and told herself that she was
not going to use the EyesÅf first function against the Priestess of the Moon.
Sacrificing the blue-haired princess to save humanity was not the reason for
which she came down to this Enshrinement Chamber.</span></i></p>

Oogami Kazuki picked up the other scroll and handed it to her, Ågis the
Chronicles of the Swords, which contains all the information that mankind has
gathered on the Elemental Blades,Åh he said, then added in a serious tone, ÅgYou
should pay extra attention to the last entry, for I believe itÅfs vital in
dealing with the Swords. Had it not been for Souma, we would have never known
what it could do.Åh</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>The
Chronicles, as it turned out, described in details the functions of the Sealed
Swords, forged from the unknown shards of metal that the Council of Priests had
discovered after the first holy war. There were eight different sets of
handwritings, each occupying a large section on the scroll, every single one
dedicated to a Sealed Sword. Himeko read them carefully and tried her hardest
to cramp the details into her head so that she had an idea of what to expect
once she laid her hands upon the Eye of Aurora. Then, as Himeko proceeded
toward the end, her eyes fell upon the last section of the scroll. It was the
shortest one of them all, in which an Onmyouji from the Sumeragi Clan, the one
responsible for the safekeeping of Tasogare and Hokuto, told of his encounter
with the Twilight Blade.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>According
to the Onmyouji, he had absolutely no luck in wielding the Sword, for every
time he tried to access the Twilight Blade, he was met with a barrier strong
and thick as a mountain. While his colleagues became astonished by the prowess
of the other seven Swords, he alone was stuck with a blade that refused to
demonstrate its might. The Onmyouji, infuriated by TasogareÅfs lack of
cooperation, abandoned his experiments with Tasogare and tried to forget that
it ever existed. That was why no one in the last three thousand years had been
able to figure out what powers Tasogare possessed. Although the section on the
Twilight Blade concluded with bitter words of defeat, it was not the end of the
scroll itself. Following it was another paragraph written by the current High
Priest himself.</span></i></p>

Blade possessed supreme control upon all Seals and Barriers aside from the
Shadow Element. Thanks to said abilities, Tasogare is impervious to the Voice
of Sorrow, that which renders any other Blade useless. However, this piece of
knowledge proves that we need to take desperate measures toward the Twilight Blade,

text-indent:.5in'>The solution to all of her problems lies in the power of the
Twilight Blade. Tasogare alone could help her prevent the Orochi from killing
her beloved Chikane-chan when they succeeded in conquering the Earth. The
Sealed Sword could return to the other girl the life she had before this whole
mess had started. It certainly could make blue-haired princess smile happily
again. Being the weapon that reigned supreme over all seals and barrier, the
Twilight Blade was the only thing in this would that could allow Himeko to
break through the Sword GodÅfs Thirteen Seals, rouse Ame no Murakumo from his
eternal sleep, and pull the OrochiÅfs nemesis out of the Core Sphere.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'>Akatsuya and Kagetsuki began to glow golden and silver in her
hands, each fiercely demanding more and more power from her so they could
perform the task that she had set them to. Knowing that they truly needed it,
she gave them all she could spare. Once they had received enough, the two Eyes
of Heaven disintegrated into an ocean of sparkling stars then regrouped as quickly
as they had pulled apart and reemerged as two perfectly imitated Tasogare.
Gazing at the pair of Twilight Blades that were hovering in front of her chest
in such a way that their lower edges were level with the ground and their tips
were pointing away from each other, Himeko firmed her resolve and decided that
the time had come for her to put an end to this war between the humans and the
Dark God. The instruments were ready. The stage had been set. The villain was present.
All that was left to do now was summoning the hero of the story, who would
bring forth her belated demise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>At the emergence of the twinned Tasogare, she was immediately
gifted with a brand new vision. Not only did her eyes become sharper and clearer,
they also allowed her the sight of something that had been hidden from the rest
of the world. Now, her gaze was able to penetrate the surface of the devastated
moon. Now, she was able to see that directly beneath the ruined Lunar Shrine
lay a dimensional space protected by thirteen spherical barriers. She knew that
they could be nothing other than the Core Sphere and the immensely powerful
Thirteen Seals that made up the dimensional prison of the Sword God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Having found her target, she extended her arms so that her
hands were standing upright and her palms faced away from her chest. The two
Tasogare then revolved around the empty space separating their hilts. As they
did, they multiplied. The moment the two Twilight Blades finished switching
place was also the one in which ten more had been created. Twelve of them now
formed the spokes of a brimless vertical wheel stationed airborne in front of
her chest. Mouth tightening, she put her right hand at the wheelÅfs center and
activated the power of the Swords.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>As the jewels separating the blades and the hilts of the
Tasogare became alight, darkness emerged at the latter and gathered into an orb
black as the night around her hand. The wheel of Swords went round.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>As though it was the surface of a pond disturbed by a rock,
space literally rippled and sent invisible waves, originated from the black
sphere, in every direction and gave Himeko the impression that they were
pulling her particles apart. Once the last wave had passed her by, the black
orb engulfing her hand began to pulse and made her think that perhaps she had
fed it to a hungry lion. It gnawed at her finger, it crushed against her skin,
and it sucked her power the way a vacuum machine would dust. Against her will,
celestial power raced from the furthest corners of her body to her fingertips
and ended up being consumed by the insatiable orb. Desperately she held her
power back. She knew that unlike the Eyes of Heaven, Tasogare was far greedier.
If allowed, it would left nothing in her and kill her before Ame no Murakumo
showed up.</p>

Sun with his body cloaked by an Invisibility Spell, Izanagi found his eyebrows
climbing off his scalp. Once before he had had the surprise of his life when
the Priestess of the Moon ignored the guidelines of the Project and joined
forces with the Sinner Sei no Tsurugi no Rinne. As soon as he discovered what
Kannazuki Aoi was planning to do, he had expected that Kurusugawa Himeko would
take the blue-haired girlÅfs place and followed the guidelines that had been
established three thousand years ago. He was dead wrong. Now, in spite of
himself, he was being taken aback by the other PriestessÅfs suicidal attempt to
free his son without drawing the blood of the disobedient Moon Priestess. He
could not help it, for he knew that should the golden-haired idiot be allowed
to continue what she was doing, the Human World would be thrown in chaos.</p>

the twelve Twilight Blades. From the sphere throbbing around her hand came a
myriad of black wires which punched through the surface of the moon and struck
the first layer of the Thirteen Seals he wove shortly after imprisoning the
Sword God. At the very moment of contact, the first Seal rippled before fading
away like water vapors in the atmosphere. Soon, the rest of the Seals shared
the same fate as the black wires punctured through them all and ultimately tied
themselves around the Core Sphere, the last obstacle that stood between
Kurusugawa Himeko and the Sword God. Being assaulted continuously by the
devastating power of the wires, the Core Sphere began to writhe. Had it a
mouth, it would scream. Had it limbs, they would thrash.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>Izanagi massaged his forehead in a mix of frustration and
somewhat awe. When he wove the Core Sphere and the Thirteen Seals, he had
anticipated that somebody might try to break them in order to rescue Ame no
Murakumo. However, the aggressor he had in mind then was Amaterasu, Susanou, or
Kagutsuchi and certainly not one of the Kannazuki Priestesses. It was not that
he trusted the two girls, he doubted he had ever trusted someone other than
Yuusaku the Chief Messenger, he simply never thought either capable of even

surprise, Kurusugawa Himeko had proved more than able to completely destroy the
Dimensional Prison itself. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Where

mysterious supply of energy and racked his brain for a solution to the
impending crisis. The golden-haired girl was about to open the gate of Ame no
MurakumoÅfs prison and die trying. Project Kannazuki was teetering on the brink
of failure. Sei no Tsurugi no Rinne was still roaming free in Onogoro,
unchallenged and unchecked. The more he thought about trying to solve those
problems, the more hopeless he felt. Although he could directly intervene and
save the Human World from its destruction, he would not. Doing so would mean
that he would have to break the divine laws that he himself set forth. Doing so
would turn him into a laughingstock for his enemies in the Underworld. And that
he would rather die than see happening.</p>

of the Core Sphere being distorted by the black threads she had tied around it
while grimacing at the pain that kept jolting in her hand and made her felt as
though needles were nettling its back. The black orb of light, ever hungry for
more power, was actually doing more damage to her body than simply trying to
crush her hand flat. Thanks to its consuming a massive amount of her power in
such a short amount of time, her internal system had been strained to the point
that it was currently breaking apart. Every few minutes, she would cough out
blood that eventually dyed the front of her chihaya with the color red. She
knew that if she continued to ignore the injuries, she would die very soon. The
only problem was that she did not have time or the power to heal herself. The
power she lost during the battle with the blue-haired princess was necessary.
The power to heal she could not afford. Besides, she was going to perish in the
end anyway, so she did not care too much about a few internally bleeding
wounds.</p>

to be destroyed, Himeko decided to send another amount of her energies into the
black orb. The action took its toll on her immediately. The pressure that was
building rapidly in her body almost caused her eyes to explode. Fierce currents
of lightning surged in her nerves and threatened to burn them to dust. More
blood came from her mouth, some of spilled onto the revolving Elemental Blades,
where they sizzled and were vaporized an instant later. Her vision weakened,
her head grew lighter, and her limbs became so weak that she had to consume
every ounce of physical strength she had to keep herself airborne and her hand
inside the black orb.</p>

through the Core Sphere, dissolved it, and revealed the dimensional prison that
was hiding within. Hastily, she withdrew her hand, reduced the Twilight Blades
to the original two copies, and finally returned them into their true shapes,
the Twin Keys of Awakening. Airborne, she watched as a pair of humongous gates
made from steel rose upward from a horizontally woven Dimensional Portal. Once
they had fully emerged, they slowly opened and revealed the darkness beyond.
The Sword God was about to be freed.</p>

Himeko glanced downward at the place where she had spent quite a while

control the Sword God. She had expected her Chikane-chan to be watching her

darkness beyond the steel gates. It was only then did she realize that she had
dropped herself into boiling soup. It was only then did she understand the

forward. After every step she took, the power in her increased three-fold. As
soon as she passed through the broken shoji door, it burst into flame and fell
to dust in less than a heartbeat. When she reached the center of the room, she
had massed so much celestial energy that comparing her with Makoto would be the
same as comparing an ocean and a lake. ÅgIt seems that you preferred otherwise.Åh
Pressure rolled off the woman in waves, crashed upon every object in the

a deep sigh upon seeing her rival the Priestess of the Moon leapt into her
crush the Priestess of the SunÅfs arms. The more she watched the former cry her
eyes out atop the latter, the more irritated and hopeless she became. Some part
of her was gladdened, however, at seeing that the golden-haired girl was safe
and sound despite being slightly hurt. Had something worse happened to Himeko,
Makoto would have gone after HimemiyaÅfs life even if it would cost her own.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>Heaving another sigh, she withdrew her gaze from the two
girls, one crying and one trying to calm the other down, and placed it on the
person who was standing a few feet away and confining herself to quiet
chuckles. It was an Immortal with long golden-hair that seemed to shine without
any source of illumination, body clad in a snowy hagoromo that were radiating
strange sense of power, and a beauty even Sei no Tsurugi no Rinne did not
possess. Yet, what surprised Makoto most was the unknown womanÅfs potential. She
was as powerful as the Seraphim Blade herself. That Makoto certainly never
expected.</p>

the moon a minute ahead of Makoto and was now standing next to her, suddenly
spoke up, ÅgAlthough I knew Kurusugawa Himeko to be an airhead, I never thought
she was this much of an idiot.Åh From the womanÅfs casual tones, no one would
have believed that just a few minutes ago she almost succeeded in utterly
destroying Makoto. ÅgIf Tasogare could free Akira, he would not be in there
right now.Åh The dark and snappish quality of her voice told Makoto that the
Seraphim Blade had tried something similar to what Himeko did and was slapped
down by failure. She resisted the urge to laugh.</p>

blast,Åh the platinum-haired woman continued absently. It was only then that
Makoto realized that Rinne was talking to herself, not to anyone else in
particular. She guessed after three thousand years of solitude, anybody would
have gone a little crazy in the head, much less a tormented woman who spent
every of her waking moment trying to cling to the memories of the man she
loved. ÅgFor that, I suppose I need to thank her.Åh Her gray eyes swiveled toward
the golden-haired Immortal who was standing on the ground and watching the
Priestesses of the Sun and Moon with open interest. ÅgWhat are you trying to do,

Blade made her claim the most obvious thing in the world. Makoto opened her
mouth and would have told Rinne a few choice words had she not remembered that
she probably did not want to provoke the woman who could kill her as easily as
not. Anger still boiled in her, though.</p>

to the Goddess of the Sun and began to narrow her eyes at the latter, appearing
to be pursuing her own thoughts. Were Makoto to guess, she would say that the
Seraphim Blade was trying to come up with a way to make Himemiya Chikane and
Kurusugawa Himeko kill each other... but not quite succeeding. The Priestesses
of the Moon were already a force to be reckoned with. Now that someone as power
as Amaterasu, who appeared to be very keen on protecting the two girls, had
appeared, she seriously doubted that the platinum-haired woman could harm a
hair on eitherÅfs head.</p>

caught her attention and turned her head. Down low, the blue-haired heiress of
the Himemiya empire had placed a hand on the other girlÅfs forehead. Soon,
silver light flooded out from where their skin met as a vacant expression crept
across their faces. Makoto knew that Himemiya could be doing nothing other than
showing her counterpart the memories that she had been hiding in her heart. MakotoÅfs
heart ached painfully in her chest. Now that the Moon Priestess had showed the
Sun one the truth, Makoto no longer had any chance to win over the love of her
former roommate. Everything she had done up to this point, as it turned out,
was useless.</p>

answering the question, the blue-haired girl simply gazed at the image that was
being shown on every wall of this dimensional vision with a face that spoke
volumes of sadness. Unable to help herself, Makoto too, looked. What she saw
was the interior of the Kannazuki Tower, the crystal structure that was hidden
beneath the surface of the Memories Sea most of the time. At the very top of
the Tower of Agony floated the Mirror of Life, from which crystal chains
emerged and coiled around two cross-shaped Altars revolving soundlessly around
the Mirror itself. Chained to each of these Altars was a stone statue of a girl
in Priestess outfit. What had struck Makoto like a slap across her face the
first time she laid eyes on them was not the fact that those two were exact
replicas of Kurusugawa Himeko and Himemiya Chikane, but that both of them must
have been frozen in time at the exact moment in which they were trying to reach
for each other. Their right arms were outstretched. Their bodies were leaning
forward as thought they were running toward one another. And their expressions
showed just exactly how painful and heartbroken they had to be feeling in their
hearts. As soon as she noticed those details, she had experienced a hurricane
of emotions that threatened to pull her down to her knees and make her weep.</span></i></p>

embarrassment when the Goddess of the Sun glanced at her teasingly with her

slight shake as though she had just been doused with cold water. ÅgThere, itÅfs
done.Åh The High Immortal withdrew her hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgWhat do you mean, Amaterasu-sama?Åh Chikane asked, puzzled.
Himeko did not seem to want to leave her embrace the way the girl held on to
her body very tightly and continued to cry softly against her neck. Chikane
never tried to push her sweetheart away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgDonÅft you ever wonder Himeko never remembered what happened
in her past life?Åh Amaterasu said, smiling. She paused and waited for a nod
from Chikane before she continued, ÅgItÅfs at the end of the first holy war, when
Kagetsuki pierced her heart, it slowly eroded her memories. The Eye of HeavenÅfs
power was so strong that its effect survived the passage of three thousand
years. Every time her past-life memories resurfaced, they were swiftly
destroyed.Åh She paused again to give a frustrated shake of her magnificent
head. ÅgEven though they were aware of it, the Immortals of Heaven refused to
heal it for her. They thought that it was all the better if she never
remembered that she was the sacrifice, for they feared that if she did, she
might be scared into doing something... drastic to save herself.Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ChikaneÅfs lips thinned in anger. <i><span style='font-family:
"Footlight MT Light"'>Ignorant fools,</span></i> she thought. <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>How dare they think of Himeko that way
when it was she who forced me to drive the blade through her heart?</span></i>
Sighing, she tightened her arms a little bit more around the slender body of
the little angel and placed a quick kiss upon the top of her head. Himeko,
whose crying has been reduced down to a sob every few seconds or so, looked up
at her with a pair of amethyst eyes filled with love and gratitude. She rose on
her toes a little bit and her mouth opened slightly as though wanting to claim
ChikaneÅfs lip. She would have, too, had the High Immortal not cleared her
throat and reminded the girl that she was not in private. The golden-haired
Priestess, apparently had forgotten about Amaterasu, gave a start and burrowed
deeper into the curve of ChikaneÅfs arms in embarrassment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgLittle children, the moment for us to fight back has
arrived.Åh The GoddessÅfs tone suddenly grew serious. Knowing that Amaterasu was
about to tell them something important, Himeko let go of Chikane and placed her
full attention on the golden-haired Immortal, who nodded at her in approval.
She then raised both hands and summoned the Eyes of Heaven. When her golden
gaze fell on them, her face hardened and her mouth twisted in disgust. ÅgTell
me, what is the name of these weapons?Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgThatÅfs right, Himeko,Åh she said. When she looked at the Eyes
again, her grim mood returned. ÅgMy children, you should know that name is an
outrageous lie. The True Keys to the Awakening of Ame no Murakumo are the blood
and life force of a Priestess. Not the swords themselves.Åh</p>

ÅgHereÅfs another riddle for you, sweet children of the Moon Goddess. The Eyes
require blood and life force to function. They can destroy memories. They wield
transcending powers. What do they remind you of?Åh</p>

Immortal was implying. Her breath caught. ÅgThe Mirror of Life!Åh The confusion
surged in the Red Thread of Fate told her that Himeko was not following what
they just talked about. Chikane then gave her another smile to say that she
would explain everything later. The nod that was given back informed her that
the golden-haired girl understood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

true culprit behind all this. It was what powered the Eyes of Heaven, it was
what locked the Sword God in, and it was what sustained the Core Sphere and its
Thirteen Seals. After he had created Project Kannazuki three thousand years
ago, Izanagi found himself confronting a great dilemma. He knew that the Mirror
was required for the summoning, yet he could not give it to the Priestesses. It
was too important and it would have killed you two as soon as you tried to use
it. Finally, he found a solution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgIzanagi, shrewd and devious, forged the Eyes of Heaven from
a fragment of the Mirror and transferred into the former Ame no MurakumoÅfs
seal. Since the Eyes are practically the MirrorÅfs spawns, they are linked. I
said that breaking Kagetsuki and Akatsuya wasnÅft easy because Inochi no Kagami
would supply them with power to prevent them from being destroyed. If you want
to summon the Sword God, you will need to break the Eyes and the Mirror both.Åh</p>

Goddess gave her an indulgent smile. ÅgMy child, the Red Thread is a weapon that
transforms emotions into power. The stronger the emotion, the more power it
has. Little one, there is no emotion stronger than love, especially the love
that you two share.Åh Her smile grew affectionate. ÅgDuring the last three
thousand years, despite being sealed in the Kannazuki Tower, your mutual
feelings have never faded. Instead, it steadily grew stronger within every

to combat the Mirror of Life.Åh</p>

No word was needed.</p>

A terrible cold wrecked her body apart. She could see the approaching figure of
a dark-haired man clad in a snowy flowing robe the stiff collar of which bore
the Sun and Moon Crest on either side. His forehead was adorned with a crown.
His belt hung a sheathed sword. His face was young and handsome, but at the
same time it was so cold and hard that it would make ice seem cold and steel
seem soft. He was the same man who had told them on their birthday that the
Priestess of the Sun was going to be sacrificed to vanquish the Orochi. <i><span

Her eyes were fixed on the Maker of the World, who stood just about a couple
dozen feet away, and followed every of his movement so that she would be able
to respond in time should the man try something... drastic. She would not put
it past him to kill her right then and there without batting an eyelid.</p>

amusement. Before long, she threw her head back and laughed until a few drops
of tear rolled down her cheeks. Izanagi never did anything to her. The man simply
watched her with narrowed eyes and thinned lips. That was his equivalent of
another man roaring out in anger. It was an expression that she knew intimately
well. Ever since the Goddess of the Moon swore an oath to become her sister,
the Lord of Izumo had looked at her in the same way more often than not. It was
open wonder why she was still alive. ÅgI beg to differ, my lord,Åh she said once
she had her mirth under control.</p>

a magical entity that had unrestricted access to the life force of every mortal

strengthen itself and its spawns, the eyes of Heaven. Fighting against First
Supreme was futile, for it was the same as fighting every living man and woman
in the Human World. ÅgThis, however, is not one of those.Åh</p>

the thoughts whirling in his sadistic mind. Right now, he was wondering whether
she was making a bluff the way his dark eyes scrutinized her as though wanting
to reach into her soul. The thoughtful look that came and dominated his face
told her that he began to fear that perhaps she had truly found a way to defeat
his most prized possession, the Mirror of Life. And of course, the only way to
verify it would be summoning the Mirror itself.</p>

seemingly at the impunity of the attack. He did not understand. The amount of
power he had woven into the flame wave should have been enough to shatter her
defense and give her a few burns at the very least.</p>

rebellious daughter dressed. For the last few decades or so, the Goddess of the
Sun had always worn modern clothing whether she was in the Human or the
Heavenly World. Now, her body was graced with a hagoromo robe that was
radiating a very familiar sense of power. Narrowing his eyes, he examined the
traditional outfit and realized a second later that it was coated with a
transparent layer that must have been where that exceptionally strong barrier
came from. Then he knew. The rose patterns on the robe, its familiar sense of
power, and its ability to nullify his attack with contemptuous ease all pointed
to the conclusion that the thing must have been made in the Underworld. He did
not doubt that he was looking at a super concentrated and reversed Sealing
Field wrought by the transparent layer, which in turn was made from the petals
of the infamous Crystal Roses.</p>

however, he sensed the presence of an enormous amount of power rushing toward
him from above his head. Hastily, he lifted his hand and wove a barrier
spinning around his body. The pillar of liquid fire that slammed against the
protective layer was so strong that its heat managed to seep inside, reached
him, and made him very glad that he had reacted on time. Had he not, he
probably would have been burned to ashes.</p>

shone so intensely that their luminescence erased the stars and the Earth riding

angelic wing. IzanagiÅfs fists clenched at his sides. It was the true form of
Sei no Tsurugi no Rinne, the Seraphim Blade. It was the very sword which he had
commissioned Izanami to design and forge more than three thousand years ago. He

that she could cut him into pieces with the silvery surface, Izanagi invoked his

ground like a rock. It was the power of gravity, he realized, which the
weakling of an Orochi Korona was never capable of wielding. When he managed to
snatch back control, it was already too late, for the only thing that he could
do was forcing himself to land painfully on one knee on the ground instead of
having his front slammed against it. Grimacing, he looked up and swallowed at
the sight of the Goddess of the Sun, in whose hand Sei no Tsurugi no Rinne was
blazing with a white light as bright as a torch.</p>

wreathed in protective light, and tried to parry the sword stroke. He had
thought that he would be able to catch it unharmed. He was wrong. At the moment
of contact, a force strong enough to level mountains leapt at him, hurled him
off his feet at the speed of a bullet. He ended up crashing into the ruins of
the Lunar Shrine. Lying amidst burnt wood and darkened stones, he almost
groaned out loud in heart-searing pain. Every bone in his left hand had been
shattered and every nerve severed, he knew. There was no way he could use it
again at least until the fight had concluded.</p>

commented. ÅgAs far as I can see, you only possess half the power you did before

never been any gentler with you than it was to my little brother.Åh</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Izanagi simply narrowed his eyes at the girl and said nothing.
What she said was right, in any case. Ame no Murakumo was so strong that
sealing him was beyond IzanagiÅfs power unaided. Without any other alternative,
he had had to resort to Inochi no Kagami, which, according to the restriction
he and Izanami had placed on it since its creation, required an insane amount
of life force in exchange for its transcending power. Being very nearly
crippled by the Mirror, Izanagi had lost half of his power as soon as he was
done trapping the Sword God beneath the surface of the moon. If he had not,
there would be no way in hell that the Goddess of the Sun could touch a strand
of hair on his head, much less hurting him.</p>

your blood, girl,Åh he said dryly and drew his katana out of its scabbard. His
powers then raced to his hand and became doubled as soon as they reached the
sword that he named the Flow of Eternity. Unlike other magical weapons, Towa no
Nagare was incapable of delivering powerful attacks. The only thing that it
could do was compensate for the power that Izanagi had lost after the fight he
had with Ame no Murakumo.</p>

golden-haired girl was staring at Towa no Nagare, which was blazing like the
midday sun in his hand, with a dead serious expression on her face. In the beginning,
she only used one hand to wield Sei no Tsurugi no Rinne. Now, she put both
hands on its hilt. ÅgOne of us has to die here today.Åh</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>They began to match swords. On one hand, Izanagi believed
that there was no point in hurling spells at the girl, for the petal-coated
hagoromo of hers would just nullify them all. On the other, he knew that the
Sun Goddess would not use her magical abilities against him either, for he
would never allow her enough time to cast any spell. Physical battle was the
only option they could take.</p>

steel and produced shockwaves that rocked their bodies. This fight was heavens
and earth different from the one he had with Ame no Murakumo, for in that
fight, all that they were trying to do was restraining each other. In this one,
he and Amaterasu only wished to obliterate one another so that they could
achieve their own goals. One mistake could cost Izanagi his life. One second of
distraction could blow his rebellious daughter to dust.</p>

scars upon the surface of the moon. Their feet left deep imprints upon its
rocky ground. The forces they employed to wield their weapons created long and
steep fuming cracks that bore into its crust. The more they fought, the more
Izanagi was afraid that they were going to split the moon apart. His fear
vanished a few moments later with the appearance of relieving but equally
disturbing signs.</p>

longer so powerful he had to parry them with every ounce of strength he had.
Nor were they as fast as they had been in the beginning. As a result, he began
to overwhelm her. Shortly after that, he succeeded in forcing her into total
defense and rendered her unable to do anything except blocking his blows or
retreating from his attacks. Even though he was clearly winning, Izanagi was
furious. It was a good thing that the golden-haired Immortal was about to
win... but it was not exactly comforting being aware of what was devouring her
strength and vitality. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>I have

and delayed a swing of her sword. Immediately he poured all his strength into
Towa no Nagare and blasted Sei no Tsurugi no Rinne away from the Sun GoddessÅfs
hand. Amaterasu, apparently in too much pain to even hold herself erect, sank
to her knees and clutched at her heart while gasping desperately for air.
Infuriated, Izanagi raised the Flow of Eternity high and prepared to bring it
down on his daughterÅfs head. It was time to end this ridiculous struggle once
and for all, he told himself.</p>

coldly from behind him at the same time that a cold hand was placed on the nape
of his neck. His heart dove into his stomach as his eyebrows rose in horror.

you here to make sure that you do not. I would have stopped you from the
