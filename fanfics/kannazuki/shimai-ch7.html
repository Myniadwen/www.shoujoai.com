<p>&quot;I  know that you have reservations, Reverend Ohgami,&quot; Chikane said,  &quot;but under the circumstances I think that we have to make the  attempt. In light of yesterday's attack, I believe it to be clear  that the Orochi are not going to let us pursue our agenda leisurely.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  was always impressed by how effortlessly Chikane could move between  formal and informal speech. It was almost second nature to her, the  way she could combine the precision of word choice with polite  phrasing at will. If Himeko tried that she'd probably end up  spraining her tongue.</p>
<p>&quot;Nonetheless,  Tsukuyo, the requirements are very clear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are  you any closer to finding the Solar Priestess?&quot; she asked him  directly.</p>
<p>He  clearly did not want to admit the point, but like so many other  people faced by Chikane's stare he gave in. That was another thing  Himeko envied about her; she herself couldn't work up any kind of  forceful personality unless it was over something she cared about a  whole lot.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot;  the priest was forced to admit. &quot;We aren't. There's nothing  that we've found in any of the shrine's archives thus far that  suggest that there's ever been a missing priestess. Destiny is  supposed to draw them--you--together.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane's  gaze flicked to Himeko.</p>
<p>&quot;It  always has,&quot; she agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;Thus  far, we haven't found a way to accelerate that. Given that it has  been two days now, I worry...what if the Orochi have found her  first?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;No.   I know what it feels like when the Solar Priestess dies. It is as  if half of my soul has been ripped out of me.&quot; She quickly  turned to Himeko and added, &quot;I'm not just talking about the  emotional pain, but in the spiritual sense, the feeling that death  had severed the link connecting us as priestesses.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  don't think that the Orochi know any more about her than we do,&quot;  Himeko pointed out. &quot;When that woman attacked me, she was  expecting me to be the Solar Priestess. She realized right away that  I wasn't, so I guess the Orochi can feel that somehow, but she  thought that I was. So they weren't even looking for someone else  until yesterday evening.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's  a good point,&quot; Ohgami said. &quot;At least we have a head start  in the search.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  at the same time, it just goes to emphasize my own point,&quot;  Chikane seized the opportunity. &quot;The Orochi will want to kill  the priestesses, but they only know of one: me. It's almost  guaranteed, then, that there will be further attacks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Except  that the reason that they seek to destroy the priestesses is so they  can create the very situation that we are currently faced with: not  having both priestesses available to fulfill their duties.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That  argument seems circular to me. What I don't see is, where's the harm  in trying? We have everything to gain and nothing to lose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There  is a great deal to lose! A holy ritual gathers the energies of the  gods. If not completed properly, that power can be released wildly  and could injure or even kill the participants. Will you risk doing  the Orochi's work for them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  have to try. If I am going to protect Himeko and myself, then I am  going to need the full power of the Lunar Priestess. We cannot  afford to play a waiting game when the odds are so badly against us.&quot;</p>
<p>Their  eyes met, and the sudden tension made Himeko want to flinch away or  hide behind something.</p>
<p>&quot;Um...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday  it was your own daughter who was at risk, Reverend Ohgami; Marika  only survived because Himeko deliberately chose to lead the Orochi  away in another direction.&quot;</p>
<p>It  was Ohgami that flinched rather than Himeko. Himeko knew that  Chikane's deft cruelty was as much a mask as the Lunar Priestess's  imperious air of command or Miya-sama's princesslike attitude, but it  still made her sad that her beloved could say something like that.</p>
<p>&quot;I...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  understand that there are risks, but the greatest risk lies in doing  nothing. We cannot allow ourselves to be paralyzed by fear just  because events are not unfolding to expectation.&quot;</p>
<p>He  frowned slightly, then at last sighed and nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Very  well. Will you proceed at once?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.   I'll need a short time to prepare. Do you have the vestments here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of  course. I'll show you.&quot;</p>
<p>He  took them down the hall to another room, where he opened a chest and  took out a finely made broad, flat wooden box which he set on the  room's single low table. He lifted the lid, revealing the neatly  folded white jacket trimmed with violet and violet <em>hakama</em> pants that were the formal vestments of the Lunar Priestess.</p>
<p>&quot;Will  this room be all right for you to change in?&quot; I'm sure that  Marika would not mind lending you her bedroom if you need a mirror.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This  will be fine, thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very  well, then. I'll await you outside.&quot; He stepped out into the  hall and slid the screen shut.</p>
<p>Himeko  watched Chikane lift the outfit out of its box, gently smoothing out  the folds with her palms. The sight brought back a warm rush of  nostalgia; while their names and families might change with each  reincarnation and even in Mahoroba time relentlessly marched on,  changing as the ages passed, this did not. The Lunar Priestess's  garb was the same as it had been in the cycle before, and the cycle  before that, and even in memories that were mere phantoms, stretching  all the way to their very first battle against Yamata no Orochi. It  was something as eternal as Chikane herself; seeing her twin holding  it made her feel a strange sense of rightness, of destiny met and  fulfilled.</p>
<p>&quot;Would  you hold this for a minute, Himeko?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  passed the vestments over, then pulled her T-shirt off, unbuttoned  her jeans, and pushed the pants down before stepping out of them.   Himeko couldn't help smiling at her. Chikane turned to take the  Lunar Priestess's garb and saw Himeko's open appreciation.</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?  My Chikane has a perfect body. I'm envious!&quot; And then, because  she knew what response it would provoke, she softly added, &quot;Although  that does mean that I get to touch it...&quot;</p>
<p>As  she expected, a delicate blush stained Chikane's cheeks a faint pink.   She was kind of envious of that, too--Chikane was even embarrassed  in ladylike fashion, but she also thought it was incredibly cute.</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko,  stop that,&quot; Chikane said, but without any force to it.</p>
<p>&quot;Why?  This is the one thing I can tease you about and get a reaction.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who  would have thought shy, sweet you could be so shameless?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh-huh!&quot;  Himeko refused to back down. &quot;Because it's you. Why shouldn't  I want to show my love?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why  not, indeed,&quot; Chikane said, and pulled off her sports bra.</p>
<p>Himeko  sighed. &quot;You're cruel, Chikane. But I'm still going to watch.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  swiftly donned the undertunic, the longer top jacket, and the  pleated, billowing <em>hakama</em>.   Since the sash tied in front, she was able to do it up by herself,  which still impressed Himeko.</p>
<p>&quot;There!&quot;  she said. &quot;Is everything all right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh-huh;  it's all perfect.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good.   That just leaves one more thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's  that?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  went over to the chest where Reverend Ohgami had kept the vestments  and took out a second, identical box. From it she took the second  set of priestess vestments, identical to her own except for that red  replaced the violet.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane...?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It  doesn't make much sense to have only one of us properly dressed for  the ritual.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;But  it's not right. Only the Solar Priestess should wear that outfit.   It's wrong if I do it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's  also wrong to perform the ritual of unsealing wearing your ordinary  day-to-day clothes. It would show disrespect.</p>
<p>&quot;Perform?&quot;  Himeko squeaked. &quot;I wasn't going to perform anything!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It  takes two people. With only one, it would be out of balance. It's  not like summoning Ame no Murakumo, where one priestess only has to  shed blood and pray while the other performs the rites and  incantations.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Two  priestesses, not just two people!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  it does have to be two. It's impossible to do it with just one. It  would be like trying to row a rowboat with an oar on only one side.   It would be like Reverend Ohgami said, very likely dangerous because  the energies being summoned aren't properly directed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then  get someone else. Reverend Ohgami could do it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's  a man, Himeko; the ritual is designed for two shrine maidens.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well...&quot;  She fished for an answer for a bit before coming up with one. &quot;What  about Professor Ohgami, then? She's the eldest daughter of the Ohgami  family and was trained as a priestess of this shrine before she gave  it up to become a scientist. And Reverend Ohgami did say that she  knew more about the rituals than he ever did!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko--&quot;</p>
<p>She  clenched her fists in frustration.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane,  I'm not the Solar Priestess or anything any more. I don't have any  kind of power or know any magic or holy rituals. It's not going to  help you to go on as if I did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko...&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  set down the garment box and came over to her twin. She took one of  Himeko's hands in her own and gently cradled it, opening the clenched  fist to better touch both sides. Chikane took a deep breath, then  spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;I  know that you aren't the Solar Priestess, although I don't understand  it,&quot; she began. &quot;That doesn't change the fact that I need  you by my side. It's not just as Chikane the girl, either, but as  the Lunar Priestess. Without you, there's no way that I can be who  people want me to be, need me to be. It's not just that I'm doing it  for you, but because you're there.&quot; A hitch came into her voice,  a hesitancy. &quot;So...please?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All  right, Chikane,&quot; Himeko submitted. She wasn't sure it was a  good idea--no, she was all but convinced that it wasn't--but she  would do it for Chikane's sake, not just out of love but because her  sister asked her for so little, sought very few favors and only then  when it was really important to her. Unlike Himeko, she was much  more comfortable giving than taking. &quot;I'll do this with you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank  you.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  started undoing her shirt buttons, then paused and grinned slyly.   &quot;Admit it, you just want me to put on the miko outfit so you can  watch me take my clothes off.&quot;</p>
<p>Her  teasing was as much a question that the tension between them had  eased, and Chikane confirmed it by smiling back.</p>
<p>&quot;Now,  Himeko, if that was my goal, I would have just stayed home with you  today,&quot; she said, and gently tapped the tip of Himeko's nose.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>&quot;It  doesn't look like much,&quot; Kei said doubtfully. To be fair, he  was right. The small shrine was set in an out-of-the-way glade, up a  winding path about a hundred meters from a road that was a country  lane on the outskirts of town anyway. The shrine was weatherbeaten,  its paint peeling, even a crack running from a knot in one of the  boards. The <em>shimenawa</em> rope tied around the stand was fraying, and the <em>shide</em> streamers  descending from it tattered and torn. The priest who took care of  the shrine was a man named Yanagii; he was in his late eighties now  and simply unable to carry out his duties to their fullest extent,  but pride had prevented him from admitting it and ceding his duties  to a younger person.</p>
<p>Reiko  knew all this, but was in no mood to hear it, at least not from Kei.   None of it had anything to do with the point at hand.</p>
<p>&quot;The  issue isn't what it looks like, Kei. The question is, what's <em>inside</em>?  Is it just a shrine, or is it a seal?&quot;</p>
<p>Kei  snorted.</p>
<p>&quot;This  old piece of junk? It couldn't seal up a kitten. If you ask me--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You  have an awful lot to say, don't you?&quot; Reiko snapped. &quot;The  Himemiya family endows all kinds of shrines around Mahoroba. That  isn't a coincidence, you know. The Himemiya founded this village;  we're its heart and soul--and Mahoroba is the place where the world  of the gods touches the earth. The connection isn't <em>random</em>.   These shrines are supposed to contain evil spirits, after all.&quot;</p>
<p>It  was almost exhilarating, Reiko thought. The old Reiko would never  have been like that--forceful, sharp-tongued. This was the way  Tsukuyo would be, wouldn't it, if she was faced with a recalcitrant  retainer? For honest mistakes, one would be gracious, but for  intentional wrongdoing or arrogant encroachment--ah! She'd seen  Tsukuyo boldly, forcefully deliver a setdown that left its object  slinking away in shame, but she never had imagined that she herself  might be able to do the same.</p>
<p>Then  again, she wasn't the wallflower any more. She held a position  worthy of a Himemiya at last, the First Neck of Orochi!</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot;  Kei admitted, then grinned as he finished the thought, &quot;if it's  evil spirits they're talking about, then we certainly can give them a  taste of that!&quot;</p>
<p>Still  grinning toothily, he flexed his hands and the air around him seemed  to <em>thicken</em>,  clouding up into a dark shadow like the swollen body of a kraken.   Coiling tentacles of black shadow extended from the shape, pale  violet lightning crackling along their length. They snaked towards  the shrine, seeming to poke and prod towards it, and as the dark  extrusions neared the shrine it began to glow in response. It was a  golden aura, but there was something else, a darkness within, pushing  at the gold seal from inside. It swelled and throbbed, trying to  reach out towards the seeking shadows.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,  yeahhh,&quot; Kei said. &quot;Damn, that's it, isn't it? One of the  eight gods--the real thing, isn't it, not just some lousy Shadow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is  it yours?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can't  tell. Damn seal's in the way.&quot; He punched his fist into his  left palm. &quot;Not for long, though!&quot;</p>
<p>The  tentacles lanced down, striking like snakes at the golden veil. It  seemed certain the thin aura would be ripped apart by the darkness  assaulting it from both sides.</p>
<p>But  it wasn't.</p>
<p>Gold  light flashed and the shadowy tentacles recoiled, snapping backwards  as if they'd touched an electric fence. Kei grunted in pain and  cursed under his breath, then spat on the grass.</p>
<p>&quot;So  that's the way it's going to be, eh? Gonna make me work for it?&quot;  The violet lightning crackling around the shadow projections blazed  up, and what looked like single eyes opened in the tips of each  tentacle. Electricity lashed down, crashing into the shrine, then  rebounded back, striking the ground, blasting the top off one of the  surrounding trees, spearing the air. Again Kei unleashed the  lightning, a hail of fire that could have blown apart an armored car  or a cottage--but not, apparently, the shrine's seal. One of the  rebounding bolts almost struck Reiko, but she parried with the black  sword of Take no Sukunazuchi.</p>
<p>&quot;Together  this time,&quot; she snapped, and unleashed a blast of force from the  sword into the glowing shrine accompanied by another hail of violet  lightning. The force of the reflected assault this time was enough  to send the two Orochi sprawling. The dark shadow inside seethed and  twisted, as if the destroying god was raging in frustration, but the  golden aura was untouched.</p>
<p>Reiko  let out a groan, shaking her head. Kei got back to his feet with a  roar, summoning up all the power of Yatsu no Onokoshizuchi that was  his to command.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop  it, Kei!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>What?</em>&quot;  he roared, rounding on her.</p>
<p>&quot;I  said stop!&quot; she snapped back. <em>Yes!</em> she thrilled in her heart. It was so exciting, so exhilarating to be  wielding this power. Not the sheer power to destroy that was Take no  Sukunazuchi, but the power of command over herself, the willpower to <em>act</em>,  be bold and decisive. To be, in short, the kind of girl that Tsukuyo  Asamiya wouldn't have overlooked for year after year!</p>
<p>&quot;What  the hell are you talking about? Damn it, First, this thing--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;--has  shrugged off an attack by both of us together,&quot; Reiko finished  his sentence in what she was sure was a much more sensible fashion  than Kei would have. &quot;This isn't like a wall that you can just  beat on with a hammer until it breaks. In case you hadn't noticed,  this sealed shrine hits <em>back</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>Kei  scowled at her, then at the shrine, then back at her. He muttered a  few more curses, but then the Shadow of Yatsu no Onokoshizuchi faded.   With the active presence of the Orochi gone, the light from the  shrine and its imprisoned darkness faded as well.</p>
<p>&quot;Then  what the hell are we supposed to do, huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Firstly,  you calm down. In case you haven't realized, we've managed to learn  something here--that I was right. This shrine <em>is</em> sealing one of the Orochi gods.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So?  Fat lot of good that does if we can't get to it.&quot;</p>
<p>Reiko  sighed. Was it possible this oaf was the same age as she was? He had  the hatred and the violence that suited an Orochi, but good God, he  was sometimes so <em>stupid</em>.   Or maybe it was just obstinate pigheadedness, but it added up to the  same thing. Even Reiko's weak-spirited former self had never been  stupid.</p>
<p>&quot;The  point is,&quot; she explained slowly and patiently, &quot;that we now  know what the problem is. Before we had nothing but guesses, but now  we know, and it gives us a chance to plan.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All  right, then, what is this plan?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;First  things first. This is one shrine, but there should be seven more,  seven other sealed gods. Once we know <em>what</em>,  then we can figure out how. Maybe it has to be the correct god's  Neck that breaks it out and this isn't one of ours. Maybe there's  some ritual to do it. We can all pool our knowledge--but first,  we've got other shrines to investigate.&quot;</p>
<p>She  extended a hand to Kei. He hesitated, then reached down, took it,  and helped her to her feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank  you.&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps  this was what had caused her attraction to Tsukuyo, not the girl's  beauty and charm but envy, a yearning to possess the confidence and  poise she herself lacked by cleaving to another who had them.   Certainly as the First Neck of Orochi she didn't feel the same  craving as she had in the past. She had something better.</p>
<p>And  once the gods of Orochi were fully unleashed, she would make the  world feel it.</p>

<p><em>A/N:  The description of how the summon-Ame-no-Murakumo ritual works in the  manga world (as opposed to the anime) is based on how it happened:  Himeko wishes, and the god shows up, and then Tsubasa reacts: &quot;You  used the blood from your first time to...&quot; Thus, I assume that  Chikane performed the actual ritual of summoning while Himeko was  unconscious, leaving it &quot;open-ended&quot; so all Himeko had to  do was pray for assistance at the appropriate time and Ame no  Murakumo answered.
