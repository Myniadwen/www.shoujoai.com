<h1>Ame no Murakumo ga Miteru:  Red String (part 7 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kannazuki/index.html">Kannazuki no Miko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dezopengiun.html">DezoPenguin</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kannazuki/redstring-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><P>"Yes...yes, ten o'clock will be fine. We'll be expecting you."</P><P>Kurusugawa Hajime 
set the phone handset back in its cradle, then let out a long, deep shudder.</P><P>"Hajime, 
dear?"</P><P>He glanced at his wife, saw her round, pleasant face marked by worry. That was 
all this day seemed to have brought them both. Worry for his daughter's well-being when 
he'd first heard the rumors, then worry over his job and his family's future when his 
superiors had made their positions clear. Then worry shared and redoubled with Eiko when 
they'd talked. Then Himeko had chosen to defy them—<I>Himeko</I>, who was ordinarily one of 
the most sweetly well-behaved children he could imagine. She'd actually worked herself into 
a frenzy and run out of the house sobbing, and then had come more worry about what trouble 
she'd get into in such a state.</P><P>Then had come the phone call, and worry over Himeko's 
safety had been replaced by worry over the consequences of her actions. She'd said that 
she'd refuse to give up this infatuation, and she'd blatantly disobeyed him. How else to 
explain that she'd wound up at the house of her so-called girlfriend? She'd gone and run 
straight to the Himemiya girl. Terror had gnawed at him, worry plain on Eiko's face as 
well. <I>How far is she willing to take this? Until she destroys us all?</I></P><P>Maybe 
that was so, because by going to the Himemiya house, Himeko had insured that things would 
reach some kind of conclusion. There would be no quiet breakups, no apologies to his 
supervisor. She had apparently prevailed on her love interest to take her in, and that 
meant the Himemiyas themselves would be directly involved.</P><P>At nine-thirty in the 
evening, that fear had manifested, had come to pass.</P><P>"That was Himemiya Seiji-sama, 
Eiko."</P><P>"Is he...?" She couldn't even bring herself to say it, but Hajime knew what 
she meant. He nodded, then finished the thought for her.</P><P>"He is the son of the family 
head, the heir to the Himemiya Financial Group and the acting head of the family in 
Mahoroba." He remembered these details from articles he'd read, interested, when he'd found 
out before the move that the thousand-year-old family that owned his employer had 
originated in the small coastal town. "And...the father of the girl Himeko is infatuated 
with."</P><P>"Oh, no," Eiko whispered.</P><P><I>Why did this have to happen?</I> he asked 
himself for the thousandth time. <I>Why couldn't Himeko be a normal girl?</I> Or, if she 
had to experiment with a girl's-love romance—or even if she'd been speaking the plain truth 
when she'd told them flatly that her interest in her own sex wasn't a sudden infatuation 
but a long-standing fact—then why couldn't she have picked anyone—God, <I>anyone!—</I>else 
to have her crush on? A daughter having a lesbian romance was scandalous and embarrassing, 
but that was all. Himeko had gone and dragged the Himemiya family into the scandal. Pitying 
looks and snide mockery in the break room had instead become a reason for discharge, no 
different than if he himself had landed the company on the front page of the tabloid 
news.</P><P>"What did he say?" she found the courage to ask after a long 
silence.</P><P>"The Himemiyas want to talk with us, face to face, about the situation with 
the children."</P><P>Eiko gasped again.</P><P>"It's...it's come to that?"</P><P>"Himeko 
went to their home. I offered to come pick her up, but he said that no, he would bring her 
back home tomorrow when they came to meet with us." He sighed bitterly. "She'd gone and 
dragged Himemiya-sama personally into this. He and his wife will be here at ten tomorrow to 
'discuss the matter of our daughters' relationship.' I'm sure you understand. All we can do 
is apologize with all our heart, but Himeko...after today, I feel like I barely know her. 
Like...she might do anything. And where does that leave us? And Shiro? And Himeko herself, 
even?"</P><P>Eiko looked at him with mute entreaty and he pulled her into his arms, trying 
to convey to his wife a reassurance he himself didn't feel. His eyes flicked around the 
small room, at the new arrangement of furnishings and space he still wasn't used to. They'd 
lived there only a week, hardly enough time for it to be called a home, and yet the thought 
of leaving threatened to drive him to tears.</P><p style="text-align:center;">~X X 
X~</P><P>The morning sun was bright, spreading the soothing warmth across the sleeping form 
on the bed.</P><P>"Himeko."</P><P>There was no reaction; the blonde slept on, her tousled 
hair spread out across the pillow.</P><P>"Himeko." More insistently, now, it seemed to make 
at least some headway; though her eyes didn't open, her lips moved.</P><P>"Go 'way, Shiro; 
don' wan' get up."</P><P>"Hi. Me. Ko!"</P><P>"Waaah!"</P><P>She sat bolt upright in bed, 
eyes blinking madly; Chikane thought she looked so cute that she burst out 
giggling.</P><P>"Chikane-chan! That was mean!" Himeko pouted. "I'm still 
sleepy."</P><P>"Sleepy, indeed, if you mistook me for your little brother."</P><P>Himeko 
blinked in surprise.</P><P>"Ehhhh?"</P><P>"I believe your exact words were, 'Go 'way, 
Shiro.'" She struck a sexy pose, with her hands behind her head and back arched. "Do I look 
ten to you, and male?" she added, pouting playfully.</P><P>"Oh, <I>you</I>." Himeko threw a 
pillow at her; laughing, Chikane caught it.</P><P>"All joking aside, it's time to get up, 
Himeko."</P><P>"Huh? Howcome?"</P><P>"It's eight-thirty. We're supposed to be at your 
parents' house at ten."</P><P>"Ah! That's right!" She started to leap out of bed, got her 
feet tangled in the covers, and fell out of bed, her waist bent at the edge of the mattress 
so that she faceplanted on the thankfully soft carpet and had her rear end stuck up in the 
air. Chikane leered openly, then offered Himeko a hand up; both girls giggled together and 
shared a quick good-morning kiss. It felt so good, so right to be back together with 
Chikane again.</P><P>That thought, though, got the butterflies going in Himeko's stomach 
once again. What did Chikane's parents want to say to hers? Would it help them be together? 
Would her own parents be furious at her disobedience as well as at her relationship? There 
were so many potential problems! She hoped it would go all right, but...</P><P>Himeko 
showered and brushed her teeth, then dressed in her school uniform, which had been 
laundered overnight, although she borrowed a pair of socks to go with the shoes since her 
tights had been ripped. She was kind of surprised that Chikane hadn't tried to lend her 
clothes as well, but that actually turned out to be part of her plan.</P><P>"We don't want 
your parents to start thinking about you borrowing things from your rich girlfriend," she 
said. "It's impossible to avoid the prestige of the family name, but I don't even want to 
hint that you might be out for a financial advantage." Chikane sighed, then frowned. "I 
can't stand that I even have to <I>think</I> about that. I <I>hate</I> that people can be 
so small-minded."</P><P>"Chikane-chan..." Himeko touched her lightly on the arm. "Please 
don't be angry. It's not their fault. They just want to make sure I grow up to be a good 
person." She shook her head, then added, "No, if it's anyone's fault, it's mine. I knew 
that we would meet again, and that we'd be lovers when we did, but I didn't prepare for it. 
I could have told my parents about you they way you told yours about me, but I didn't. I 
didn't even have the courage to tell that that I knew I'd be with another girl. If I'd at 
least confessed my sexuality, they wouldn't have been so shocked."</P><P>"Himeko." Chikane 
tapped her on the nose chidingly with her forefinger. "We've talked about your claiming 
things are your fault when they're nothing of the kind."</P><P>"But, 
Chikane-chan—"</P><P>"No, no, and no again. You're giving me credit for courage, but 
anything I said wasn't bravery, it was a <I>plan</I>. Me, preparing the ground in advance 
for what I knew would come. That isn't courage, it's minimizing risks; it's avoiding 
danger, not facing it. Yet once again I failed to account for something important when 
planning out my life." She chuckled softly. "Perhaps I should turn in my Evil Mastermind's 
license, hm?"</P><P>Himeko laughed.</P><P>"You'd better do that anyway. You don't do evil 
very well. You couldn't even get your own victim to believe you." This time they both 
laughed, before Chikane slipped her arms around Himeko's waist and pulled her 
close.</P><P>"I love you, Himeko."</P><P>"I love you too, Chikane-chan. No matter what 
happens, for good or bad, I'll always love you." She tipped her head back, and Chikane's 
mouth descended on hers, soft and yearning. Himeko's hands slid across her lover's back, 
feeling the sleek play of muscles beneath the lightweight white sundress.</P><P>"It's so 
hard to tear myself away from you," Chikane sighed. "We'd better get going, though. I don't 
want to make us late."</P><P>Himeko nodded, letting Chikane go with regrets that matched 
the other girl's. They went downstairs, where they were greeted by Chikane's parents in the 
breakfast room. The meal was delicious, but Himeko was so nervous she could only eat a few 
bites, drawing sympathetic looks from all three Himemiyas. When they'd finished, Seiji led 
them outside, where the long, silver limousine was waiting at the base of the steps before 
the mansion portico. The driver opened the door and they got inside, and in a few moments 
the car was underway, gliding smoothly down the walk and out through the gates.</P><p 
style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P>Kurusugawa Shiro's jaw dropped as he saw the 
limousine turn into their driveway and pull to a stop. He figured any car like <I>that</I> 
must have been making a U-turn or something but no, the moment it stopped, the engine 
turned off.</P><P>It was just one more strange thing in a series of them that had begun 
when Himeko had come home the previous afternoon. Sure, life had been weird enough as it 
was, getting hauled out of the only home he'd known and dragged across the country to some 
little town in the sticks, the exact opposite of city life in Chiba. Himeko had been all 
excited about it from the instant their dad had named the town, like she was all for it and 
happy to leave her home and friends. Getting Kuro had been really great, of course, but 
getting used to the new place was tough, to say nothing of a new school, coping with 
homework and being "the new kid" where most of the class had lived their all their 
lives.</P><P>But last night, things had gotten <I>really</I> weird, even scary! First, 
Himeko had said she'd she'd joined the kendo team, which was strange enough. His sister was 
such a girly-girl most of the time that she was a total loss. She was like, the exact 
opposite of an athlete! Then, though, the scary stuff had started. Their parents had gotten 
so serious, and then sent him out of the room. He figured Himeko was in <I>big</I> trouble, 
and that was crazy! Himeko never got into any trouble at <I>all</I> except by accident; she 
was so <I>boring</I> that way!</P><P>There'd been yelling and shouting, then, though on 
both sides, and Himeko had <I>run off</I>. His dad had gone out to look for her after a 
while, but come back alone, and a short time later had gotten a phone call which had made 
him really mad. And Himeko hadn't come home! Shiro had asked what was wrong, but they 
wouldn't tell him. This morning, she still wasn't back, and his dad was still angry, and 
his mom had been crying. Something really awful was happening, and they wouldn't tell 
him!</P><P>A driver in a pearl-gray uniform got out of the car and opened the door like 
they did on TV. A short man in a dark suit got out, then extended a hand to a woman 
carrying a file folder and helped her out too. There was something about them, the boy 
thought, that fit with the car. He didn't really understand it in the way an adult would, 
to put it into words, but it seemed natural to them to be surrounded by fancy stuff, not 
weird or out of place. If he'd seen the people first, he'd have <I>expected</I> this kind 
of car and it'd have seemed wrong if it hadn't been there.</P><P>The third person to get 
out of the car was of the same type, a tall, elegant girl in white with dark hair down to 
her knees. Shiro was of an age where he pretty much assumed that girls had cooties unless 
proven otherwise, but this one was dazzling, like a movie star or something.</P><P>The 
fourth person was Himeko.</P><P>"Hime...oneechan?" Shiro gaped. What was his sister doing 
with people like this? He scampered for the door.</P><P>"Otousan! Okaasan!" he shouted as 
he fumbled with his shoes. "Hime-neechan's home! She's with some people in a 
<I>limo</I>!"</P><P>That his parents didn't seem at all surprised was just one more strange 
thing to add to the list.</P><p style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P>Kurusugawa 
Hajime's heart was in his throat as he met the Himemiyas at the door. He barely noticed 
that Seiji was a head shorter than he was. He <I>did </I>notice the way Himeko clung to the 
hand of the teenaged girl who had to be her "Chikane-chan," saw how the girl gave it a 
quick squeeze in turn before releasing Himeko to let her step into the foyer and perform 
the introductions.</P><P>"Otousan, Okaasan, may I present to you Himemiya Seiji-sama, his 
wife Himemiya Hayate-sama, and their daughter Himemiya Chikane-ch—san. Himemiya-sama, these 
are my parents, Kurusugawa Hajime and Kurusugawa Eiko."</P><P>"I apologize for the state of 
our humble home."</P><P>"No, the fault is ours for requesting that you accommodate our wish 
to meet here," Seiji responded politely. Neither he nor his wife gave any sign of the 
emotions they must have been feeling; their polished manners were securely in place without 
a chip in the facade.</P><P>He led them into the family room where they would hold their 
discussions. It was a Japanese-style room, and he wondered if Western chairs would be more 
suitable for his wealthy guests, but this was the only room large enough for them to sit 
comfortably.</P><P>"Can I offer you a cup of tea?" Eiko said. "I know that it won't be as 
good as you're used to, but..."</P><P>"A cup of tea would be lovely, thank you," Hayate 
replied.</P><P>They seated themselves on cushions around the low table, Eiko distributing 
the cups of green tea before joining them. It was, not surprisingly, Himemiya Seiji who 
began.</P><P>"I believe that we all know why we are here," he said bluntly. "Our daughters 
have initiated a relationship and, moreover, made it public. We are now presented with a 
variety of issues concerning which, hopefully, we can reach some form of mutually 
acceptable resolution."</P><P>"Otousama," Chikane said, "may I say something before we 
begin?"</P><P>"Certainly, Chikane."</P><P>Hajime thought that she might launch into some 
kind of impassioned defense of their actions, but instead she bowed to the 
Kurusugawas.</P><P>"I must apologize to you for my actions in making Himeko and my 
relationship one open to the public. I did so thinking only of my own selfish happiness, 
without consideration for what it would mean to her family. I can't ask for forgiveness, 
but I am sorry for what I did, and I wish that I could have handled things in a proper 
way."</P><P>"Chikane-chan..."</P><P>She sounded sincere, though with her polished grace it 
was hard to tell.</P><P>"I appreciate your candor, Himemiya-san," Hajime told her, trying 
to stay polite. Turning to her parents, he went on, "For my part, please accept my deepest 
regrets that this incident should have happened at all. Please do not hold this against my 
daughter, for becoming involved in this matter or for troubling you again last night. 
Though foolish, she is young and the passions of youth led her astray; it was my fault and 
my wife's for not properly anticipating this as adults and acting appropriately to prevent 
your name from being sullied."</P><P><I>The formality of it all makes my tongue ache,</I> 
he thought. <I>A simple salaryman has no place talking to people like 
this.</I></P><P>"Kurusugawa-san, forgive me, but you seem to be laboring under a 
misapprehension," Seiji said, raising a hand. "We have no desire for revenge or to inflict 
punishment. My wife has thoroughly reviewed your employee records—" Hajime's eyes flicked 
to the file she carried, but Seiji shook his head. "No, not that; that file is something 
different we will come to presently. You appear to be a loyal and competent professional, 
who earned your recent promotion through merit rather than by contacts and cronyism. Such 
individuals are valuable; they form the backbone of our business operations. It was utterly 
inappropriate for your supervisor to conflate a private, family matter with company 
business. The relevant parties will be informed of their errors."</P><P>Hajime was 
thunderstruck. That Himemiya would take such an attitude seemed impossibly generous, but 
there it was; he had the man's word on it. Beside him, Eiko gasped, her face lighting up, 
and Himeko had the same reaction. It was as if a giant weight had been lifted from him; he 
scarcely knew how to react.</P><P>"Thank you, Himemiya-sama," he said—although in truth, 
<I>babbled</I> wouldn't have been too far off as a description. "Your 
generosity...it—"</P><P>"You should thank your daughter, Kurusugawa-san," Hayate 
interjected. "She was the one who brought this matter to our attention so that we could act 
before it was too late." Her eyes flicked towards Himeko and she smiled. "Really, child, do 
you intend to blush at <I>everything</I> I say? At this rate you shall give me a 
complex."</P><P>"Um...I'm sorry, Himemiya-sama. I can't really help it."</P><P>"Well, we'll 
work on that, as well as this 'Himemiya-sama' nonsense. We did discuss this 
yesterday."</P><P>"Yes..." Himeko murmured, blushing even more furiously.</P><P>"You should 
let her have her way, Himeko," Chikane tossed her. "Okaasama has my stubbornness, you 
see."</P><P>The way she addressed Himeko, without honorifics at all, made Hajime want to 
twitch. Of course, it could have been appropriate between them if meant in the sense of 
lord-to-peasant, where the respect shown by the use of an honorific was not necessary, but 
under the circumstances he was sure that it was, instead, a matter of the emotional 
intimacy between the two girls. For himself, he couldn't comprehend it. Forms of address 
suited to lifelong friends, passionate protestations of love when confronted, <I>kissing in 
public—</I>and all within the space of scarcely more than <I>two days</I>. He couldn't 
understand how such a bond could exist, one that formed that deeply that fast.</P><P>He 
sipped tea, giving himself something to do while trying to make sense of it all. Across 
from him, Himemiya Seiji did the same, then set his cup aside.</P><P>"Now that the 
peripheral questions have been dealt with," Chikane's father stated, "we can progress to 
the less urgent but, I believe, more important matter at hand. Namely, what are we, as 
parents, going to do about this relationship between our daughters?"</P>
