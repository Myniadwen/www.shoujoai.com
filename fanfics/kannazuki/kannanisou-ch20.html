<h1>Spiral of Destiny (part 20 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kannazuki/index.html">Kannazuki no Miko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nwarford.html">Nathan Warford</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kannazuki/kannanisou-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>Himeko and Chikane stared in horror at the new Ame no Murakumo that had 
appeared before them. The God of Swordsmen was colored the same shade of 
purple as Gattai Orochi was, and looked just as vicious. &quot;How is this 
possible?&quot; Himeko said. &quot;How can Ame no Murakumo be Orochi&#39;s Eighth 
Neck?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what happened when Orochi&#39;s power left my body,&quot; said Chikane. 
&quot;When the Orochi inside me realized that it couldn&#39;t control me, it 
transferred to Ame no Murakumo.&quot;

&quot;But how can the God of Swordsmen be an Orochi?&quot; Himeko asked. &quot;I 
thought only people with the Orochi Gene could become Orochi.&quot;

&quot;Remember the legend?&quot; asked Chikane. &quot;The eight bodies of Orochi were 
spawned when Susanou cut off Orochi&#39;s eight heads. And then Susanou 
found the sword Ame no Murakumo within Orochi&#39;s tail. Because Ame no 
Murakumo was once part of Orochi&#39;s body, she carries the same gene that 
allows Orochi to control his followers!&quot;

&quot;If it were not for you Priestesses,&quot; Ame no Murakumo roared, &quot;it would 
not have come to this. You disobeyed me and now you will pay the price!&quot;

&quot;Her conscience has been overthrown by anger,&quot; Chikane realized. &quot;Ame no 
Murakumo knew that her life was in danger. Even though she&#39;s a God, her 
desire to survive must be just as strong as ours. The fear and the dark 
feelings that came with facing her own destruction were what caused the 
Orochi inside her to surface.&quot;

&quot;Can we defeat Ame no Murakumo in her Orochi form?&quot; wondered Himeko.

&quot;It was difficult to overcome her power even with the combined strength 
of Amaterasu Oomikami and Tsukuyomi no Mikoto. But remember what 
Tsukuyomi said. I found the other half of the bivalve, a sign that you 
and I are meant to be together; the love that we share is so powerful 
that it rivals the power of the gods. With the power of that bond, as 
well as the power of Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu, we can defeat Ame no 
Murakumo once and for all, and lock her away inside the Lunar Shrine 
along with the other Orochi!&quot;

&quot;I told you,&quot; Ame no Murakumo said, &quot;you do not have the power to lock 
me away. Only I am granted that ability!&quot; In a fraction of a second, Ame 
no Murakumo gathered enough power to fire a powerful beam of light from 
the spike on her head. Himeko and Chikane did not have enough time to 
react and they were both thrown to the ground. Ame no Murakumo rushed at 
the grounded Priestesses with lightening-fast speed, giving Himeko and 
Chikane barely enough time to roll out of the way of the blades on the 
Sword God&#39;s wrists.

&quot;She&#39;s fast,&quot; Himeko said.

Tsukuyomi no Mikoto stood to Ame no Murakumo&#39;s left and Amaterasu 
Oomikami stood to her right. Ame no Murakumo looked back and forth 
between the two celestial gods. &quot;Which one of us are you going to 
attack, Ame no Murakumo?&quot; Chikane asked.

&quot;Both of you!&quot; The God of Swords turned toward Tsukuyomi no Mikoto and 
fired her rockets, sending Amaterasu Oomikami flying.

Himeko cried in fear as her body flew backwards. &quot;Himeko!&quot; cried Chikane 
at seeing Himeko in pain. Ame no Murakumo&#39;s mouth opened and a beam of 
purple light fired from her throat. Chikane attempted to block the beam 
with Tsukuyomi no Mikoto&#39;s blade, but the beam simply engulfed the blade 
as well as Tsukuyomi&#39;s body. It was not a beam meant to damage the 
opponent, but to immobilize it! The glowing fabric that the beam had 
transformed into constricted around Tsukuyomi&#39;s body, rendering the Moon 
God unable to move!

The power of Ame no Murakumo&#39;s rockets continued to propel her toward 
Chikane and she swung at the Lunar Priestess with the blade on her right 
wrist. Unable to run, all that Chikane could do was shift her weight to 
the right so that Tsukuyomi no Mikoto would fall out of the way of Ame 
no Murakumo&#39;s blade. The tactic worked and Ame no Murakumo&#39;s blade only 
nicked Tsukuyomi no Mikoto&#39;s left cheek. The blade also left a cut in 
the glowing fabric surrounding Tsukuyomi no Mikoto, which the God of the 
Moon climbed through to free itself.

However, only after she was free of Ame no Murakumo&#39;s net did Chikane 
feel a stinging sensation on the left side of her face. She touched her 
cheek with her hand and found that her cheek was bleeding! Chikane had 
not even felt a blade cut her cheek; the injury had simply appeared! For 
a moment, Chikane was surprised and panicked by the wound that she had 
received and she retreated back to Himeko, who was standing up from Ame 
no Murakumo&#39;s rockets. &quot;Chikane!&quot; said Himeko at seeing Chikane&#39;s cheek 
bleeding.

&quot;Be careful, Himeko,&quot; said Chikane. &quot;It seems that when Ame no Murakumo 
is in her Orochi form, any attacks you receive from her are inflicted 
onto your body.&quot;

&quot;If I kill your other selves,&quot; Ame no Murakumo said, &quot;you die along with 
them!&quot; Ame no Murakumo ran at Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu again.

Himeko aimed the Solar Priestess blade at Ame no Murakumo and Chikane 
aimed the Lunar Priestess Blade at the Sword God as well. Shots of 
violet light fired from the blade on Amaterasu Oomikami&#39;s left wrist and 
shots of blue light fired from the blade on Tsukuyomi no Mikoto&#39;s right 
wrist. The blades on Ame no Murakumo&#39;s wrists spun around, blocking the 
shots fired at her. However, the spinning blades worked to increase wind 
resistance, and Ame no Murakumo&#39;s advance slowed down, giving Himeko and 
Chikane enough time to dodge out of the way.

Before Ame no Murakumo could turn around to face the Priestesses again, 
she was hit in the back by several arrows, which exploded and sent her 
flying forward. However, as she flew through the air, Ame no Murakumo 
did a somersault in the air, looking at Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu 
upside-down and fired a beam of yellow light at them. The beam knocked 
the celestial gods to the ground again, giving Ame no Murakumo enough 
time to land on her feet and turn around to face the Priestesses.

&quot;Her agility has improved,&quot; Chikane said as she and Himeko got to their 
feet. Ame no Murakumo rushed at them again.

Chikane grabbed Himeko&#39;s right shoulder with her left hand and Himeko 
grabbed Chikane&#39;s left shoulder with her right hand. Amaterasu 
Oomikami&#39;s right arm had fused with Tsukuyomi no Mikoto&#39;s left arm and 
both ran at Ame no Murakumo. Himeko and Chikane held their Priestess 
Blades in their free hands and called out in unison, &quot;Celestial Spiral!&quot; 
Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi lunged at Ame no Murakumo, both of their bodies 
spinning around one another, locked together by the purple-red arm 
between them.

Ame no Murakumo stopped in her tracks, trying to make sense of what was 
happening. The spinning blur that was Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi hit Ame no 
Murakumo, engulfing the God of Swords in a flurry of flying blades and 
feet. Ame no Murakumo tried extending her blades so that the two 
celestial gods would injure themselves in their attack, but as quickly 
as their Spiral attack had hit, they jumped away and separated into 
their separate entities, facing the disoriented Ame no Murakumo.

Ame no Murakumo had several dozen cuts around her body, each one oozing 
glowing, white blood. Himeko and Chikane then felt stinging pain in 
their legs and found that they had been cut by Ame no Murakumo&#39;s blades 
as well. &quot;I&#39;m not sure if that attack was worth it,&quot; Himeko said.

&quot;I think it was,&quot; said Chikane. &quot;Look.&quot; Himeko and Chikane looked at Ame 
no Murakumo to find that the God of Swords could barely stand from all 
of the cuts in her body. Ame no Murakumo was badly injured. &quot;I don&#39;t 
think she&#39;s able to fight any more.&quot;

Himeko and Chikane clasped their hands together and called out, &quot;Divine 
Light of the Eclipse!&quot; Amaterasu&#39;s left arm and Tsukuyomi&#39;s right arm 
fused and they fired a powerful beam of white light at the dazed Ame no 
Murakumo.

&quot;It&#39;s over for you!&quot; exlcaimed Chikane.

&quot;Not...yet...Lunar Priestess,&quot; Ame no Murakumo said in a weak, but 
defiant voice. Ame no Murakumo fell onto her back, the Divine Light 
passing less than a meter from her chest. As soon as the beam had 
passed, the rockets on Ame no Murakumo&#39;s back fired, propelling her off 
the ground and sending her flying away from Tsukuyomi no Mikoto and 
Amaterasu Oomikami.

&quot;She&#39;s...fleeing?&quot; Himeko said.

&quot;She must have realized that she couldn&#39;t defeat us,&quot; Chikane said with 
a smile.

&quot;She came close,&quot; said Himeko, holding her legs in pain.

----------

Himeko and Chikane returned to the trauma center to recover from their 
injuries. &quot;Are you two all right?&quot; Rika asked as the Priestesses 
returned.

&quot;We&#39;re all right, Missus Himemiya,&quot; said Himeko.

&quot;But your legs. And Chikane, your cheek.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s nothing serious,&quot; Chikane said.

&quot;We still don&#39;t want those to get infected.&quot; Even though Himeko and 
Chikane could walk without difficulty, Rika still offered to help them 
to the first aid center for treatment.

Himeko and Chikane needed nothing more than antiseptic, bandages on 
their legs, and a small adhesive bandage for Chikane&#39;s cheek. When they 
exited the first aid center, Himeko and Chikane were met by Rika, Otoha, 
and Makoto. &quot;What happened out there?&quot; asked Mako.

&quot;It seems that Ame no Murakumo is just as much an enemy as Orochi was,&quot; 
Chikane replied.

&quot;Ame no Murakumo IS an Orochi,&quot; Himeko added.

&quot;What?!&quot; Otoha exclaimed.

&quot;How is that possible?&quot; asked Rika. &quot;I thought that Ame no Murakumo&#39;s 
purpose was to seal Orochi away inside the Lunar Shrine. Was I 
mistaken?&quot;

&quot;That was her purpose,&quot; said Himeko. &quot;But what we didn&#39;t realize is that 
Orochi&#39;s hold over her is just as powerful as it is on any of his other 
followers. All that Orochi needed to take control of Ame no Murakumo&#39;s 
mind were dark feelings to enter her soul.&quot;

Chikane looked at her feet and said, &quot;I can&#39;t believe that we&#39;re the 
ones responsible for this.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, guys,&quot; said Mako. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll pull through in the 
end. You two have nothing but love in your hearts, and that&#39;s more 
powerful than any evil god.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Love conquers all,&#39; as they say,&quot; Otoha added.

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; said Chikane. &quot;We came close to defeating Ame no 
Murakumo. If she hadn&#39;t escaped, we probably could have beaten her. And 
our injuries weren&#39;t severe. All we need is some way to chase after Ame 
no Murakumo if she tries to escape again.&quot;

&quot;Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu,&quot; said Himeko. &quot;If we can utilize their full 
power, then we&#39;ll have a real chance of defeating Ame no Murakumo and 
rebuilding the world. But to do that, we will need to receive as much 
power from each other as possible. The more power we gain from each 
other, the more power we can pass on to our other selves.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll help you too,&quot; said Mako.

&quot;We&#39;ll be rooting for you all throughout,&quot; Rika said.

&quot;Even if we can&#39;t be with you in body,&quot; said Otoha, &quot;we will be with you 
in spirit.&quot;

Himeko and Chikane smiled and said, &quot;Thank you, everyone.&quot;

----------

For the next few days, Himeko and Chikane did nothing but lie on a bed 
and hold each other close, allowing as much power to pass between them 
as possible. Both the Solar Mark and the Lunar Mark glowed as they 
concentrated on nothing but their love. Their eyes were closed, not 
letting anything distract them from each other, not even their sense of 
sight. They could feel their powers steadily growing, but the process 
was slow. &quot;Chikane,&quot; Himeko said, her eyes remaining closed, &quot;do you 
think we&#39;ll have enough power to beat Ame no Murakumo?&quot;

&quot;Of course we will, Himeko,&quot; said Chikane.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid.&quot;

&quot;I know, Himeko. I&#39;m afraid too. But don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll always be by your 
side. I won&#39;t leave you no matter what. Even if we die, Ame no Murakumo 
won&#39;t defeat us. As long as we can be together, we will not have lost.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; said Himeko. After a long moment of silence, Himeko added, 
&quot;Even you get locked away inside the Lunar Shrine, I&#39;ll follow you.&quot;

Chikane opened her eyes and asked, &quot;If I get locked away, you&#39;ll lock 
yourself away with me?&quot;

&quot;Without a second thought,&quot; said Himeko.

&quot;Thank you, Himeko.&quot;

Himeko then opened her eyes and the two girls looked at each other. 
&quot;Chikane,&quot; said Himeko, &quot;I think that there&#39;s a way to increase our 
power.&quot;

&quot;How is that?&quot; Chikane asked. Himeko&#39;s gaze turned slightly away from 
Chikane and she blushed. Chikane&#39;s eyes widened a bit and she said, &quot;You 
don&#39;t mean...&quot;

&quot;I think it&#39;s the only way,&quot; Himeko said softly.

&quot;Remember what happened the last time I touched you? You turned away. 
The memory of that night was too painful for you.&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t have a choice. If it means defeating Ame no Murakumo and 
saving the world, I&#39;ll go through with it.&quot;

&quot;Himeko,&quot; Chikane said, worry rising in her voice, &quot;we don&#39;t have to do 
this if you don&#39;t want to. I can&#39;t let you go through with something 
that you would regret.&quot;

Himeko&#39;s eyes then widened and she said, &quot;It&#39;s too late.&quot; Himeko sat up 
and said, &quot;She&#39;s coming.&quot;

Chikane sat up as well and said, &quot;I guess we won&#39;t be going through with 
it tonight after all.&quot; The Solar Mark and the Lunar Mark started glowing 
brightly and the room was lit up with bright, white light.

Mako, Otoha, and Rika heard a loud sound from outside the facility. They 
looked out a window and saw that the sound was caused by the footsteps 
of two mechs walking away from the trauma center, one of them colored 
purple, the other colored red. As they walked, they faced off against 
another mech, an Ame no Murakumo that was now colored a dark purple, 
just the same shade as the larger mech that it had fought the week 
before. &quot;Good luck, you two,&quot; said the three women watching the 
standoff.

----------

OMAKE:

After Himeko and Chikane&#39;s cuts had been bandaged, they decided to 
conserve their strength and lie in bed next to each other, embracing 
each other so that they could gain more power from each other. However, 
the silence only lasted a moment. Himeko&#39;s eyes opened as she felt 
something press against her hip. &quot;Chikane?&quot; she said.

Chikane opened her eyes and looked at Himeko. &quot;What is it, Himeko?&quot; she 
asked.

Himeko asked, &quot;Is that a tanto in your pocket?&quot;

Chikane smiled and said, &quot;No, I&#39;m just happy to see you.&quot;
