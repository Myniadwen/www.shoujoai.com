<h1>Spiral of Destiny (part 12 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kannazuki/index.html">Kannazuki no Miko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nwarford.html">Nathan Warford</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kannazuki/kannanisou-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Chikane impaled Himeko with the Lunar Priestess Blade. Chikane thrust 
her sheathed tanto into Himeko&#39;s crotch, shedding her virgin blood. 
Chikane fired an arrow at the Earth from the Lunar Shrine, her Orochi 
powers destroying everyone and everything that Himeko held dear to her. 
Chikane stood by and did nothing as she allowed Orochi&#39;s Seventh Neck to 
take Himeko away. 

But it was not Chikane. Chikane could see herself doing everything, but 
she could not control her own actions. She felt so helpless as she 
watched so many horrible things happen to Himeko because of Chikane. 
&quot;Himeko,&quot; Chikane cried out. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ve done so many terrible 
things to you. All I want is for you to smile. I don&#39;t want to see you 
hurt! I don&#39;t want this! Himeko, I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry!&quot; 

Chikane felt someone embracing her tightly. &quot;I&#39;m okay, Chikane,&quot; she 
heard Himeko&#39;s voice say. &quot;I&#39;m okay! Don&#39;t say that!&quot; 

However, with the horrible images of her misdeeds continuously flashing 
before her eyes, Chikane could not stop herself from crying over and 
over again, &quot;I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry!&quot; 

The invisible arms around her held her tighter. &quot;Chikane, please!&quot; 
Himeko&#39;s voice ringed in her ears. &quot;You&#39;re scaring me!&quot; 

Chikane opened her eyes to see that it was Himeko that was embracing her 
and it was Himeko that was calling out to her. As she returned to 
reality, Chikane stopped crying and remained silent for a moment. 
Himeko, at hearing Chikane stop ranting, gently loosened her death hold 
on Chikane and looked into her eyes. &quot;Chikane?&quot; she asked. &quot;Are you 
okay?&quot; 

&quot;Hime...ko...&quot; Chikane breathed. Chikane wrapped her arms around Himeko 
and cried out, &quot;Himeko!&quot; 

&quot;Chikane,&quot; said Himeko, &quot;what&#39;s going on?&quot; 

&quot;Oh, Himeko,&quot; said Chikane. &quot;I had horrible nightmares. I could see 
myself doing such horrible things to you: killing you with my Priestess 
Blade in our past lives, raping you, destroying the world, doing nothing 
to stop Ogami from taking you. Himeko, I&#39;ve failed to do my duty as the 
Lunar Priestess and the one that loves you! I&#39;ve been unable to fulfill 
my promise to protect you! I&#39;m sorry, Himeko! I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; Chikane 
buried her face into Himeko&#39;s chest and cried. 

&quot;It&#39;s not true, Chikane,&quot; Himeko said in a soft, soothing voice. &quot;It&#39;s 
not true,&quot; she repeated. &quot;It&#39;s not your fault. Killing me was a result 
the destruction that Orochi caused. Raping me and destroying the world 
were because of Orochi&#39;s influence. It&#39;s not your fault, Chikane. It&#39;s 
all because of Orochi. None of the pain that you have caused is your 
fault. You have to believe me, Chikane. It&#39;s not your fault.&quot; Himeko 
continued speaking words of forgiveness into her beloved&#39;s ear, trying 
to calm Chikane&#39;s troubled mind. 

After several minutes of embracing and encouraging words, Chikane&#39;s sobs 
started to die down. She returned Himeko&#39;s embrace and said, &quot;Thank you, 
Himeko. Thank you.&quot; 

&quot;You really scared us, Chikane,&quot; Himeko said. &quot;I&#39;ve never heard you talk 
in your sleep before, and I&#39;ve definitely never heard you cry out in 
pain.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s most likely delirium brought on by hypothermia,&quot; Yukihito said by 
the fire. &quot;I&#39;ve learned at the University that dramatic changes in the 
body&#39;s functions can cause changes in brain activity such as delirium.&quot; 

&quot;Hypothermia may be part of Chikane&#39;s delirium,&quot; Kazuki said, sitting 
next to Yukihito. &quot;But I also sensed a great deal of turmoil inside 
Chikane&#39;s soul as well.&quot; 

&quot;Her soul?&quot; Yukihito asked. 

&quot;I was experiencing the horrible things that I had done because of 
Orochi,&quot; Chikane said. &quot;What stands out in my mind the most is the most 
recent incident, when I was paralyzed by Orochi&#39;s evil aura that was 
emanating from Take no Yamikazuchi.&quot; 

&quot;Isn&#39;t that the mech that you took control of last year?&quot; Himeko asked. 

&quot;I fear that Orochi is trying to retake control of Chikane,&quot; said 
Kazuki. &quot;The pain in Chikane&#39;s heart is not enough to allow her to be 
fully consumed by Orochi&#39;s evil like she was last year, but it is 
possible that Orochi still has some influence over her.&quot; 

&quot;I did feel what felt like a blade stabbing me in the back when I tried 
to summon Tsukuyomi no Mikoto,&quot; mentioned Chikane. &quot;It was strands of 
Orochi&#39;s power that were trying to enter me. I did my best to drive them 
back.&quot; 

&quot;You just have to remember,&quot; said Himeko, &quot;that it was all because of 
Orochi that such horrible things happened. And I&#39;m fine now, Chikane. I 
found my way back to you. You don&#39;t have to worry about me.&quot; 

&quot;Himeko,&quot; said Chikane, her awareness coming back to her, &quot;am I wrapped 
in your Priestess Uniform?&quot; 

&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Himeko answered cheerfully. &quot;You were so very cold when you 
found me. I needed to keep you warm and the blanket alone wasn&#39;t able to 
warm you up. So, I wrapped you in my Priestess Uniform and used my own 
body heat to warm you.&quot; 

Chikane smiled and wrapped her arms around Himeko, feeling her 
girlfriend&#39;s warm, soft skin against her own. &quot;I always loved being 
warmed by the sun,&quot; Chikane sighed. 

&quot;Do you feel well enough to perform the revival ritual?&quot; Kazuki asked. 

Chikane put her hands against the ground and tried to push herself up 
onto her knees. It took a bit of effort, but she succeeded. As she did 
so, she heard Himeko gasp. She looked at Himeko, whose face was bright 
red. Chikane looked at Kazuki to see that his expression had not changed 
much, but he was also looking at Chikane, a little red in the face. 
Chikane then looked at herself to see that her breasts were fully 
exposed. Her face turned crimson as well and she quickly covered herself 
up, crying out in embarrassment. 

Yukihito held back a chuckle at the humorous event. Himeko smiled and 
started giggling as well. Chikane also started laughing at the 
situation, with Kazuki laughing in the end as well. &quot;Himeko,&quot; Chikane 
said between laughed, &quot;give me my clothes.&quot; Himeko continued laughing as 
she helped Chikane redress. 

---------- 

&quot;Vessel?&quot; Souma echoed his brother&#39;s words. 

&quot;Yes, a vessel,&quot; Tsubasa repeated. &quot;Orochi&#39;s physical form was destroyed 
when Susanou defeated him. But Orochi still needs a physical presence to 
exist in this world.&quot; 

&quot;So you&#39;re saying that Orochi has chosen Takeshi Himemiya as his 
vessel?&quot; Korona asked. 

&quot;It would appear so,&quot; said Rehko. 

&quot;But Takeshi Himemiya&#39;s spirit is still inside,&quot; said Souma. &quot;Otherwise 
he would not have told me to not hurt Chikane.&quot; 

&quot;Could it be that Mister Himemiya is not resisting Orochi&#39;s influence?&quot; 
Miyako suggested. 

&quot;Which would mean that he&#39;s in league with Orochi,&quot; Souma added. 

&quot;What are we going to do, nya?&quot; asked Nekoko. 

&quot;We&#39;ll worry about Takeshi Himemiya later,&quot; said the First Neck. &quot;Right 
now, we have to find that shrine and destroy it before the Priestesses 
can revive Ame no Murakumo again.&quot; 

&quot;Will this be another diversion plan?&quot; Girochi asked. 

&quot;No,&quot; Tsubasa answered. &quot;It&#39;s doubtful the Priestesses would fall for 
that a second time. Besides, chances are that they are already at the 
shrine. The shrine will most likely be protected by powerful spells that 
forbid evil, so we will need all the firepower we have to bring down the 
barrier protecting it. For that, we will need all eight of Orochi&#39;s 
bodies, so we can&#39;t afford to be split into two groups.&quot; 

&quot;What about Chikane?&quot; Souma asked. &quot;If Takeshi Himemiya is indeed 
Orochi&#39;s vessel, what will happen if we go against his demands and kill 
Chikane in the process?&quot; 

&quot;Leave that to us,&quot; said Miyako, Girochi standing beside her. Yatsu no 
Onokoshizuchi and Hi no Ashinazuchi appeared behind them. Miyako&#39;s other 
self extended its snake-like arms from its hips and Girochi&#39;s other self 
threw serpentine chains about. If the need should arise, they would use 
their other selves to reach deep into the cave and extract the Lunar 
Priestess by constriction. 

&quot;Souma,&quot; Tsubasa said, &quot;only you know the location of the shrine. You 
will have to guide us.&quot; 

&quot;I only know the general area,&quot; said Souma. &quot;I found Himeko before I 
found the shrine.&quot; 

&quot;Then we&#39;ll just have to hope we can find it before the Priestesses 
revive Ame no Murakumo,&quot; Girochi said. 

&quot;We can sense the Priestess&#39;s power, nya,&quot; Nekoko piped up. &quot;Follow our 
senses and we&#39;ll find them, nya.&quot; 

&quot;Souma,&quot; said the First Neck, &quot;lead the way.&quot; 

Souma nodded and Take no Yamikazuchi appeared behind him. It was the 
Seventh Neck&#39;s constrained form, complete with the mouth-plate and blue 
coloration. Souma entered the circular portal in his other self&#39;s chest 
and the creature&#39;s green eyes lit up. The other Orochi members summoned 
their other selves and followed Souma to the mountains of western Japan. 

---------- 

As soon as Kazuki, Yukihito, Himeko, and Chikane had eaten breakfast, 
they started walking deeper into the cave, Kazuki and Yukihito leading 
the way with flashlights to guide them. &quot;It&#39;s so dark in here,&quot; said 
Himeko. 

&quot;The revival ground is up ahead several hundred meters,&quot; Kazuki 
explained. &quot;At least that&#39;s what my father calculated, based on the 
legend.&quot; 

&quot;Speaking of the legend,&quot; Chikane said, &quot;you still haven&#39;t told us the 
whole story. You said that there was a family that was connected to 
Susanou that settled in Mahoroba. What happened to them?&quot; 

As Chikane asked her question, the four came across a large chamber. In 
the center of the chamber was a kamidana that was elevated on a 
rectangular platform. In front of the kamidana was a square-shaped, 
metal tablet, and in front of the tablet were small steps leading up to 
the platform. &quot;Is this the revival ground?&quot; asked Yukihito. 

&quot;No,&quot; Kazuki answered. &quot;The revival ground is farther into the cave than 
this.&quot; 

&quot;Then,&quot; asked Himeko,&quot; what is this place.&quot; 

&quot;You wanted to know the whole of the legend,&quot; said Kazuki. &quot;It&#39;s all 
explained right here.&quot; 

Chikane and Himeko looked at the objects before them. They were dismayed 
by the imagery that they saw on the tablet: the event of Himeko impaling 
Chikane with the Solar Priestess Blade! Tears formed in the corners of 
Himeko&#39;s eyes and she cried, &quot;I can&#39;t look.&quot; She turned around and ran 
into Chikane&#39;s arms, hiding herself from the horrible image in front of 
them. 

&quot;Why would this tablet show what happened last year?&quot; asked Chikane. 

&quot;Every time the world is remade,&quot; explained Kazuki, &quot;the image on this 
tablet changes according to how the sacrificial rite of the Priestesses 
was carried out. According to image shown right now, it seems that when 
the world was remade last year, it was Miss Kurusugawa that sacrificed 
Miss Himemiya&#39;s life.&quot; 

&quot;It was the other way around in our past lives,&quot; Chikane mentioned. &quot;I 
was the one that killed Himeko.&quot; 

&quot;Still,&quot; said Himeko softly, &quot;it makes me sad to see that image.&quot; 

&quot;I know, Himeko,&quot; said Chikane, stroking the shorter girl&#39;s hair. &quot;I 
know.&quot; 

Yukihito, curious about the purpose of the kamidana, walked up the steps 
and past the tablet to inspect what was written. &quot;The writing on the 
kamidana is in Old Japanese,&quot; said Yukihito. 

&quot;Can you read it, Yukihito?&quot; asked Himeko. 

&quot;Mister Ogami has been teaching me Old Japanese as part of my training,&quot; 
answered the college student. &quot;I think I can read most of it.&quot; Looking 
at the text, Yukihito read, &quot;&#39;Here stands the Ogami Shrine. Here is the 
resting place of the god of swordsmen, Ame no Murakumo. Here is where 
the Shrine Maiden of the Sun and the Shrine Maiden of the Moon cease the 
evil god, Yamata no Orochi. Here is where the memory of the Shrine 
Maiden of the...&#39;&quot; Yukihito trailed off with a puzzled expression on his 
face. 

&quot;Yukihito?&quot; Kazuki asked. 

&quot;I think I&#39;m completely screwing up the translation,&quot; said Yukihito, 
squinting at the text, trying to make sure if he was actually reading 
what was written, &quot;but I think that it reads, &#39;...where the memory of 
the Shrine Maiden of the Moon is recorded.&#39; I can&#39;t see how the memory 
of the Lunar Priestess would be recorded here and not the memory of the 
Solar Priestess.&quot; 

&quot;Chikane,&quot; said Himeko. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; said Chikane. &quot;I&#39;m thinking the same thing you are. It might be 
written here why I was able to see the future and the past, why my 
presence affects the memory of others, and why I am able to commune with 
Tsukuyomi.&quot; 

Yukihito, having read everything on that side of the kamidana, moved to 
the other side to read what was written there. &quot;&#39;The two Shrine Maidens 
must use their powers to break the Six Holy Swords to revive Ame no 
Murakumo and then use Ame no Murakumo&#39;s power to seal Orochi away inside 
the Lunar Shrine. Of the two Shrine Maidens, the Shrine Maiden of the 
Moon is of the most importance.&#39;&quot; Himeko, Chikane, and Kazuki listened 
intently to what Yukihito was reading. &quot;&#39;The Shrine Maiden of the Moon 
alone has the power to control the Ame no Murakumo.&#39;&quot; 

&quot;I alone?&quot; Chikane said. &quot;Why?&quot; 

&quot;It doesn&#39;t say anything more about it,&quot; said Yukihito. 

&quot;I remember,&quot; said Himeko. &quot;When Souma and I boarded the Ame no Murakumo 
last year, Souma was piloting it almost completely. I hardly had any 
power over Ame no Murakumo&#39;s movements. It was as if it would only take 
commands from the person in the Lunar Priestess&#39; place.&quot; 

&quot;The Lunar Priestess&#39; importance is a secret passed down through the 
Ogami family,&quot; Kazuki said. &quot;It has never been mentioned because there 
was never a need for anyone else to know.&quot; 

Chikane looked at Kazuki and said, almost demanding an answer, &quot;Why am I 
so important? Why do I have these powers? What family was it that was 
connected to Susanou?&quot; 

Kazuki was silent for a moment. Eventually, the shrine keeper answered, 
&quot;Do you know why Susanou fought Orochi in the first place? It was to 
help a family of earthly gods that Orochi was terrorizing. Orochi had 
already devoured seven of their eight children, and was coming for the 
eighth when Susanou came. The family offered their daughter&#39;s, 
Kushinada-Hime&#39;s, hand in marriage in exchange for defeating Orochi. 
After Orochi was defeated and sealed away, Susanou and Kushinada-Hime 
were married. The family that I spoke of is descended from Susanou and 
Kushinada-Hime.&quot; Kazuki paused for a moment, reading Chikane&#39;s 
expressions, deciding if she was ready to accept his explanation. He 
then finished, &quot;The name of that family is Himemiya.&quot; 

To be continued...

TERMINOLOGY: 

A tanto, literally stranlated as &quot;short sword&quot;, is a Japanese dagger. 
Although not shown in the Kannazuki no Miko anime, Chikane used the 
tanto to rape Himeko in the manga. A kamidana is a miniature shrine. 

---------- 

OMAKE: 

&quot;Do you feel well enough to perform the revival ritual?&quot; Kazuki asked. 

Chikane looked at Himeko in her arms and said, &quot;Give us ten minutes.&quot; 
She pulled the blanket over their heads. From under the blanket came 
sounds of rustling clothes and mischievous giggling.
