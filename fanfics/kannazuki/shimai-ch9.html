<p>He  did not know how long he'd lain there. Time meant nothing without  consciousness. Had he only been stunned by the blast, downed but a  few seconds? Or more than that, genuinely knocked out? Ohgami's head  throbbed in pain and his body ached all over. The explosion of light  had sent him sprawling.</p>
<p><em>I  warned her,</em> he thought bitterly. <em>It  was not supposed to happen like this.</em></p>
<p>Ohgami  slowly pushed himself up into a kneeling position. He himself was  not the only one to suffer damage. The three prayer gates that had  formed the boundary around the enclosed area of the hidden shrine  were wrecked. The outermost was merely broken, its crosspiece  dangling to partially block the path; the middle had come apart in  chunks; and the innermost was simply gone but for the two stumps  jutting out of the floor.</p>
<p>The  great stone, too, the <em>yorishino</em> of the shrine, was damaged; a zigzag crack ran from ceiling to point,  narrow to be sure but with space showing distinctly between the  edges. The cavern walls and roof, however, were unmarked; the  release of energies had been primarily spiritual and had done their  worst to only such physical objects as were themselves infused with  spiritual energies.</p>
<p>Beneath  the stone, Tsukuyo knelt, cradling her sister against her chest.   Hikari's body was limp, her eyes closed, her hair trailing down like  a veil, the bright red ribbon she always wore half undone and  spilling across her shoulder like a trail of blood.</p>
<p>Worried,  the priest pushed himself to his feet and began to approach them.   His steps were wavering, pain and dizziness clouding his movements.   He had no difficulty passing the broken <em>torii</em>,  though. The barriers they supported were as broken as the gates  themselves were.</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko,&quot;  Tsukuyo was saying, her voice scarcely above a whisper but with a  terrible urgency in it. &quot;Himeko...Himeko!&quot;</p>
<p>The  blonde girl's eyelids fluttered and slowly raised, revealing eerily  bright violet irises.</p>
<p>&quot;Did...did  it work?&quot; she asked hoarsely.</p>
<p>Tsukuyo  reached down with the hand that wasn't supporting her sister and  picked up something from the ground: an antique sword, its sheath the  same purple as the trim on her robe, and ornamented with gold. <em>Tsuki  no miko no tachi</em>.   The Lunar Priestess Blade.</p>
<p>They'd  done it.</p>
<p>Ohgami  didn't understand how it was possible, what had made the ritual work  with only a single priestess. There was no sign of the matching red  sword--Hikari had not been miraculously restored to  priestesshood--but undeniably the seal on Tsukuyo's powers had been  broken.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm...glad,&quot;  Hikari whispered, then let her eyes fall back shut.</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko!&quot;  Tsukuyo screamed. &quot;<em>Himeko!</em>&quot;</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>The  eye of Orochi seethed and boiled. The clouds rolled, swirling  angrily, and flickers of heat lightning rumbled among them. The dark  god was displeased, and his servants did not know why.</p>
<p>It  was surprising, this threatening storm, because the Necks believed  themselves to be successful. They had scoured Mahoroba for the  shrines housing their respective gods, and had located the complete  set of eight. None of the encounters, however, had resulted in an  unsealing. The eight heads of Orochi remained locked away.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,  so we've found 'em. What now?&quot; Kei drawled.</p>
<p>&quot;We  break the seals, claim our power, and destroy the priestesses,&quot;  Reiko replied.</p>
<p>&quot;How?&quot;  he said bluntly.</p>
<p>&quot;I  hate to agree with that uncouth boy over there, but that is the key  question,&quot; remarked Saori.</p>
<p>&quot;And  I hate to agree with the whore, but yeah,&quot; Kei snapped back.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>What</em> did you call me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's  the way it is, right? Uncouth boys like me don't bother prettying  something up to save your ego.&quot;</p>
<p>Saori  glared at him, making a growling sound deep in her throat, somewhere  between a snarl and a hiss. A shadow seemed to gather around her;  sharp clicking sounds began to echo. Kei's own Shadow began to form.</p>
<p>Ozawa  snapped his fingers, the sound like a thunderclap.</p>
<p>&quot;Enough!  We have a mission to accomplish. Your petty differences can wait.   The question remains: how do we unseal the full powers of our gods?  Does anyone have anything productive to add?&quot;</p>
<p>Reiko  stared at the former soldier. <em>She</em> was the leader of the Orochi, not the Seventh Neck. His  rebelliousness grated on her, his desire to put his own will ahead of  the way of Orochi. And it galled her all the more that he was so  often right, that early on it had been her own hesitation that  enabled him to become a second leader.</p>
<p>&quot;Abe  was supposed to be seeking that way. He hoped to seek the will of  Orochi to determine it.&quot;</p>
<p>Kei  snorted.</p>
<p>&quot;More  like hide than seek. The holy-roller salaryman isn't here, in case  you haven't noticed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No...he  isn't,&quot; Reiko mused. Her eyes swept the group.</p>
<p>&quot;This  is absurd,&quot; Hirata said. &quot;We talk and talk, we spin our  wheels, we do nothing. We accomplish nothing. I prefer to take  steps.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Steps?  What steps? We have no idea what we're doing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When  you have nothing,&quot; the artist said with a smile, &quot;then you  have nothing to lose.&quot;</p>
<p>He  leaned back, falling from the <em>torii</em>,  and plunged into the mists.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>Chikane's  hands were white-knuckled, clenched around the sheath of her sword as  she sat at Himeko's bedside. Her sister hadn't regained  consciousness yet; they'd brought her back to the Ohgami house, but  this wasn't something that could be cured by prayer or magic, which  was why Himeko was now lying in a bed at Kamiyatate University  Hospital.</p>
<p>The  sword lay across Chikane's lap. For some reason, no one had tried to  take it from her or indeed even commented on it. The priestess  vestments were easily explained by the place they'd come from; what  more natural than two girls in miko costume at a shrine? The sword  was something different, though.</p>
<p>Ordinarily  her mind would have been working things through, going over the  question for whatever the answers might reveal about herself and the  powers she possessed in this life. Ordinarily. Now she had barely  given it a second thought.</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko...&quot;  she murmured. How long had it been? One hour? Two? All she could  think about was the blonde girl who lay fragile and broken on the bed  before her. <em>If  she...If she dies...</em></p>
<p>She'd  seen Himeko die before, and that always by her own hand. Only one  instance was strong enough to fully linger, that from the time before  the previous cycle, but it was more than enough. But this was  different. Even then, no matter how terrible it was, there had also  been hope, the knowledge that when their next lives came, they could  find each other again. Solar and Lunar Priestesses, destined to an  eternity of meetings and partings.</p>
<p>But  if Himeko died now, as an ordinary person, then there was not even  that slim hope. If she were to enter the cycle of ordinary lives,  ordinary souls, her existence might be drawn far from Chikane in  physical space, or even in time, with no guarantee that they would  ever be together again.</p>
<p><em>I'm  the one that has done this,</em> she thought bitterly.<em> I put your life at risk for myself, my pride, my fear.</em></p>
<p>&quot;Himeko...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chi-Chikane?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  flinched.</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko?  Himeko!&quot; she exclaimed as her sister's eyes fluttered open.</p>
<p>&quot;I  guess I kinda messed up,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Messed--?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The  ritual. I couldn't do my part. It worked, though, so I guess it's  okay.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Forget  the ritual; I'm worried about you!&quot; She pressed the call button  to summon the doctors.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm...sorry  I worried you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko!  Don't apologize!&quot; That just made it worse, as if a knife was  twisting within her.</p>
<p>&quot;But  it's my weakness that landed me here, not any fault of yours.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only  because I insisted on you participating!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  if I hadn't urged you to go out and protect people, you wouldn't have  needed the power so badly.&quot;</p>
<p>A  giggle cut the urgency, and Chikane turned to see Marika Ohgami  framed in the doorway.</p>
<p>&quot;You  two are so cute!&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  glared, but in had no effect on the girl, probably because Himeko was  grinning at the same time.</p>
<p>&quot;Seriously,  you were probably both at fault, knowing you, so why don't you just  go ahead, kiss, and make up?&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  giggled, then winced as the movement apparently made her head hurt.</p>
<p>&quot;Ouch!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Geez,  I'm sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's  okay.&quot; She rolled her head to the side on the pillow and looked  up at Chikane while she added, &quot;I like your idea though,  Marika.&quot; A little smile played on her lips.</p>
<p>&quot;All  right,&quot; Chikane said, and gave her a little kiss on the  forehead. &quot;Get better if you want more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Incentive!&quot;  Marika chirped.</p>
<p>Before  they could say anything else, they were swept out of the room by the  arriving medical staff and consigned to the waiting area. It felt  strange to be sitting next to Marika. The plain fact was, Chikane  was always at a loss with Himeko's best friend precisely <em>because</em> Marika was Himeko's best friend. She couldn't be standoffish or push  her away because it would hurt Himeko, and she couldn't fall back on  the elegant princess routine because Himeko and Marika's closeness  gave the Ohgami girl the perspective of an insider. Yet for  Chikane's own sake she didn't particularly like Marika as a  companion, something not helped by the recurrent flarings of  jealousy. Chikane knew it was petty and small of her, but she <em>was</em> jealous,  not in the sense of romantic distrust but that the moments Himeko  spent with Marika were time she wasn't speaking with Chikane.</p>
<p>Self-reproach  over that feeling, as well as the manners ingrained in her to behave  civilly, made her speak up.</p>
<p>&quot;I  suppose that you heard about what happened?&quot;</p>
<p>Marika  nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Some  of it. Aunt Minako called me and said that you'd been doing  something priestessy and that Hikari had been hurt doing it, and that  she'd been brought here as a precaution. She's going to be okay,  right? I mean, she was smiling and talking...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She'd  just woken up before you came in. The preliminary examination  suggested bruising, shock, and a possible concussion. Some of it is  from being thrown down to the stone floor, and some from the energies  involved in the ritual of unsealing; supernatural forces are hard to  measure in conventional medical terms.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  bet! But she's okay now?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  sighed.</p>
<p>&quot;I  think so. I <em>hope</em> so. But...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No  buts! She's tough, Hikari is. Soft and cuddly outside, but she's  kind of like that sword you've got there. It can flex when under  stress, and so won't break, and neither will she,&quot; Marika said  peppily. &quot;So cheer up! You'll be back together again in no  time.&quot;</p>
<p><em>But  for how long?</em></p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>&quot;It's  falling apart on us,&quot; Akemi said quietly. &quot;Eight spirits  held together by despair, hate, and suffering, eight broken people  who are filled with misery and malice. We were not meant to work  together, people like us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We  are Orochi,&quot; Reiko snapped. &quot;If Abe was here, he would say  that chaos is our fundamental nature. That doesn't mean that we  can't work together to get what we all want. We've found the Lunar  Priestess, we've found the sealed gods, and all that in only a few  days. Our victory is as inevitable as the sunset.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stirring,&quot;  Saori said dryly. &quot;But do we have any idea how we're going to  bring about this inevitability?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.   Ozawa, Akemi, I want you to try to find Abe. We need his knowledge,  the strength of his communion with Yamata no Orochi. Saori, keep  working on the problem of the sealed shrines. At the least, see if  we can work out which shrines correspond with which gods. Kei--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,  ma'am!&quot; he snapped with a mocking salute. &quot;Ready for my  orders, ma'am!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go  bring back Hirata. If he's thought of something useful, we should  all know about it. If he hasn't, then he should be helping the rest  of us.&quot;</p>
<p>The  Second Neck cracked his knuckles.</p>
<p>&quot;Damn,  you keep giving me jobs I like and I might forget to get mad that  you're ordering me around.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;May  I ask what role you have planned for yourself?&quot; Ozawa asked, his  challenge more controlled and therefore more serious.</p>
<p>The  black sword of Take no Sukunazuchi formed in Reiko's hand.</p>
<p>&quot;As  befits the heiress of the Himemiya clan, I am going to pay a social  call.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>&quot;She's  going to be fine,&quot; the doctor said. He was smiling warmly, a  man genuinely happy to be sharing good news. &quot;Our tests  revealed that there had been no concussion. At this point all she  needs is rest. Miss Asamiya has a headache, but regular  over-the-counter pain medication will be adequate; I see no need for  something stronger. I'd like her to stay here overnight for  observation, but that's just as a precautionary measure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank  the gods,&quot; Chikane said, and meant every word of it.</p>
<p>&quot;Can  we talk to her?&quot; Marika asked.</p>
<p>He  nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;For  a little while. As I said, what she needs now is rest to help  recover from the shock. It would be better if you went in one at a  time; that would tire her less.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We'll  do that; thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>Marika  smiled happily as the doctor moved on to his next duty.</p>
<p>&quot;There!  Now that ought to put a smile on your face, Tsukuyo.&quot; She  looked over at Chikane. &quot;Yep.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  was in fact beaming with relief, she was so glad. Himeko would be  fine! She'd made a foolish mistake out of her own fears, but it had  somehow turned out all right.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,  you'd better get in there before either one of you pops from twin  withdrawal,&quot; Marika continued. &quot;Love before friendship,  and all.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  was about to agree when she felt something like an icy current  flowing through the back of her neck. <em>It's  coming</em>,  she thought, but forced herself to remain calm. Telling Marika would  be one thing, but the petite girl was nearly as abysmal at concealing  her feelings as Himeko. Even if she tried to keep it back Himeko  would notice, and Chikane didn't want to worry her, not now, not  after she'd just put her beloved at risk.</p>
<p>So  she lied.</p>
<p>Smoothly,  coolly, with all the shell of Miya-sama serenity she could manage,  she said, &quot;No, that's all right, Marika; you can go first.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Me?  But why? You're her--&quot; Marika broke it off since they were in a  semi-public area and said, &quot;You're her sister, after all.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  smiled faintly and shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;I  don't intend to go home tonight. You can see her, then share the  good news with your family. I'll go second and take as much time as  I'm allowed.&quot;</p>
<p>Marika  frowned, looking a little dubious.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,  okay, I guess. If you're sure that's how you want it...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  also want a chance to make myself presentable. I've been crying too  much while waiting,&quot; Chikane pretended to admit. This time  Marika wagged a finger at her.</p>
<p>&quot;There  is nothing more irritating than hearing the prettiest girl in town  complaining about her appearance,&quot; she teased. &quot;You know  darned well that you're one of those annoying people who can cry  buckets without getting all blotchy and sniffly.&quot; She turned,  waving, and walked down the hall towards Himeko's room. Chikane  waited just until she'd gone inside, then rose from her chair and  went the other way to the exit stairs.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>Himeko  looked up, smiling, when the door opened, but her face fell slightly  when she saw that it was Marika.</p>
<p>&quot;Where's  Chikane? Is she okay?&quot; Belatedly she realized that it must seem  like she was dismissing her friend as irrelevant. &quot;I'm sorry.   That must have sounded really awful.&quot;</p>
<p>Marika  chuckled.</p>
<p>&quot;Nah,  it's okay. I haven't been your best friend all these years without  getting used to your sister complex, Juliet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Juliet?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Romeo  and? Y'know, the play by Shakespeare?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.&quot;   Himeko blushed, a little embarrassed. She was horrid at foreign  literature, but even so she should have caught <em>that</em> reference! &quot;Wait, is that how you see us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Star-crossed  lovers? You bet. When the hands of the whole world are against you,  the will of the gods themselves seem to conspire against your  happiness...It's like something out of a manga. Though I have to  say, it's a lot less fun teasing you since it turned out you and  Tsukuyo really are reincarnated souls who've loved each other down  through the centuries.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  giggled, though it made her head hurt a bit. The doctor had given  her some pills for that, but they hadn't started working yet.</p>
<p>&quot;You're...odd,  Marika.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  know,&quot; her friend responded cheerily and sat down in the chair  next to the bed. &quot;It's all part of my charm.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  like your new hair.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really?  Thanks; I had it done this morning.&quot; She'd replaced the  blue-and-violet braid with green, starting with a deep forest color  in the front with bangs puffed up into near-vertical spikes, shading  through various hues until the very back, worn long and loose, was a  brilliant mint-green. &quot;I guess I felt like I needed a little  bit of spring before winter rolls around.&quot;</p>
<p>She  stopped and her face became serious.</p>
<p>&quot;Hikari,  what's going on? Aunt Minako said that Dad took the two of you to do  some ritual, which I guess explains why Tsukuyo is dressed up like a  miko, but that's all. Now you're in the hospital and she's walking  around with a sword. Which, I may add, nobody seems to notice, which  is just weird, but...what's going on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane  and I performed the ritual to unseal the full powers of the Solar and  Lunar Priestess. It worked, which is how she received the Lunar  Priestess Blade.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait,  but I thought you weren't the Solar Priestess now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  not, but I've done the ritual a zillion times before so I knew it by  heart. I guess that was enough. But...um, I guess I didn't do a  great job holding up my end of things after all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're  talking over my head, Hikari.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  giggled.</p>
<p>&quot;That's  something I don't hear very often!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Enjoy  it while it lasts. Now explain. Use small words.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well...um...it's  like...&quot; She struggled for an analogy, wishing she could just  tell Marika to ask Chikane. &quot;Oh! It's like when we moved in to  our dorm room?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You  spent all day having sex?&quot; Marika joked.</p>
<p>&quot;Geez!&quot;  Himeko exclaimed, her face flushing. &quot;Why do you always tease  me about that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Simple.   You have by far the best sex life of any of my friends and I'm  jealous as heck of you,&quot; she said, smiling brightly.</p>
<p>&quot;Why?  You're straight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  know, but I'm working on an orgasms-per-day basis, here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  am so not having this conversation,&quot; Himeko groaned, and Marika  had to burst out laughing.</p>
<p>&quot;Geez, <em>you</em>,&quot;  Himeko added.</p>
<p>&quot;I  promise to be good. Go on, tell me how it's like moving day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well...it's  like, if there's a heavy box that it took both of us to lift, so I'd  hold one end and Chikane the other. That's how the ritual works  except it's not a box but the power of Ame no Murakumo. Only because  I'm not the Solar Priestess now, I wasn't strong enough to hold up my  end, and I dropped the box on my foot. Something like that, anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,  I follow that. But now Tsukuyo's power is unsealed completely, so  she can summon Ame no Murakumo and kick the Orochi's butt?&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Not  quite. It takes both priestesses to summon Ame no Murakumo. One  sheds the blood of the other and consecrates the offering to the god,  and the one whose blood was shed then prays for the god to come.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Darn.&quot;   Then, Marika brightened and added, &quot;Well, maybe at least she'll  have an easier time finding the other priestess? Whomever it is,  she's probably wondering where that sword came from. And then you  can figure out a way to get your job back and everything will be all  right.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  hope so. I honestly don't mind it so much, not being Solar  Priestess, but I don't want to be separated from Chikane, not ever  again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe  that's what this is about. If Chikane kills that other Solar  Priestess in the ritual to recreate the world, then doesn't it mean  that Chikane's soul will be returned to this life? But you'll still  be here, and so you can live out your lives happily together.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  smiled at the idea of growing old together with Chikane. It was a  happy thought. Ame no Murakumo wasn't really kind, though, or for  that matter cruel. The God of Swords seemed to be more concerned  with necessity than human feelings--the lives of six billion rather  than two. Or maybe it was necessary that Chikane get this kind of  happy ending so she could continue in her appointed task?</p>
<p>She  wished that Chikane was there, so that they could get it out in the  open between them. Himeko would have to talk with her about it when  she came in; the blonde firmly resolved that she wasn't going to be  put off or distracted.</p>
<p>Marika  had done a good job lifting her spirits, but she really did want  Chikane with her. Where <em>was</em> she?</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>The  lights in the hospital parking lot were the kind that shone a ghostly  blue-white rather than a warm yellow. Cars were scattered only  sparsely about; apparently the people of Mahoroba were presently in  good health. <em>Himeko  would be happy about that</em>,  Chikane thought.</p>
<p>&quot;You  can come out now,&quot; she announced into the stillness. &quot;I  can tell that you're here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can  you?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  spun to her left, looking up. The figure stood on top of one of the  lampposts but rather than being dramatic the bright light beneath  made her seem no more than a silhouette.</p>
<p>&quot;How  very interesting, Tsukuyo.&quot;</p>
<p>Reiko  Himemiya dropped down easily, the thirty-foot descent apparently of  no matter to the Orochi.</p>
<p><em>She's  changed</em>,  Chikane thought. When they'd fought in the classroom Reiko had been  shaky, swept away by emotion and despair. Now she was different,  more poised, seemingly confident. The power of the dark god was  intoxicating, Chikane knew all too well. Perhaps Reiko had found the  will within herself to master that power the way Tsubasa, the  previous First Neck, had done.</p>
<p>&quot;You  couldn't the first time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  hadn't awakened, then.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  see.&quot;</p>
<p>Reiko  smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;I  finally understand what it was, you know. That drew me to you? I  didn't love you or desire you. It truly was <em>akogare</em>,  purely admiration. Everything about you was what I wanted to be:  beautiful, elegant, brilliant, poised, respected, and above all  confident. Secure in myself.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  wanted to laugh. <em>Me?  Secure in myself?</em> Reiko had been utterly deluded by her facade, mistaking veneer for  substance.</p>
<p>&quot;And  in what way,&quot; she replied icily, &quot;do you think I could  possibly care about the thoughts of an Orochi?&quot;</p>
<p>Reiko  flinched.</p>
<p>&quot;Bitch,&quot;  she hissed out. &quot;Oh, you bitch.&quot;</p>
<p>Her  Shadow came to her hand, the black sword crackling along its length  with violet lightning.</p>
<p>&quot;I  worshipped you for years.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  never asked for that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Didn't  you, <em>Miya-sama</em>?  Isn't that <em>exactly</em> what you craved? Do you have a single friend? Someone other than your  sister you'd lift a finger to help because you want to instead of  because it was proper?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yamata  no Orochi's First Neck lectures me on morality? This from the prime  minion of the God of Destruction?&quot;</p>
<p>Reiko's  face twisted fiercely.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, <em>damn  it</em>.   Because it's people like you who <em>deserve</em> to be brought down. You've <em>earned</em> your annihilation by making the world into what it is.&quot; She  brought her left hand around to take the sword in a two-handed grip.   &quot;I'd come here to just talk with you, to settle the past between  us, but not any more.
