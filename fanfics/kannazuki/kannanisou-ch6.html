<h1>Spiral of Destiny (part 6 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kannazuki/index.html">Kannazuki no Miko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nwarford.html">Nathan Warford</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kannazuki/kannanisou-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Otoha hastily opened the front door, walked out, closed the door behind 
her and leaned against the wall beside it. She breathed heavily, trying 
to catch her breath. &quot;What happened?&quot; she wondered. &quot;What could have 
caused me to have such an intense reaction?&quot; 

After she had recovered from her attack of coughing, the maid looked out 
upon the land in front of the house. The full moon shone overhead, 
illuminating the area, allowing Otoha to see all of its features. The 
road that led up to the front entrance, the circular court just outside 
the door, the fountain in the center of the court. 

However, the object of Otoha&#39;s attention was the giant stone golem 
kneeling in front of the fountain. &quot;What is that thing?&quot; she wondered. 
&quot;Where does it come from? What is its connection to Miss Murakumo?&quot; 

As she looked upon the creature, Otoha saw behind it the large tree that 
had been in front of the estate when she first arrived there 11 years 
before. They were just about the same height, the golem and the tree. 
The maid walked to the tree and looked up into the branches. &quot;This 
tree,&quot; she said to herself. &quot;It seems so empty. It hasn&#39;t lost any 
leaves in the ten years since I came here. Why does it suddenly seem to 
be missing something?&quot; 

She looked back at the stone creature. Although motionless, it still 
seemed alive, intent. It seemed as if it was looking toward the house. 
Otoha looked in the direction of the statue&#39;s gaze and saw a window with 
a light on inside. It was the guest bedroom, the room where Chikane and 
Himeko were staying in. &quot;Chikane Murakumo...&quot; said the young maid. &quot;Who 
are you? Tell me who you are. Tell me what these feelings inside me 
are.&quot; 

---------- 

Inside the guest bedroom, Chikane and Himeko were getting ready to go to 
bed. Chikane was wearing a purple nightgown that used to belong to Rika 
when she was Chikane&#39;s age. The funny thing was that Rika had given that 
nightgown to Chikane in the other reality as well. Himeko also had to 
borrow pajamas from Rika. Rika had worn ordinary, yellow pajamas before 
she had married into the Himemiya family and they fit Himeko 
surprisingly well. 

&quot;How are you feeling, Himeko?&quot; Chikane asked, as Himeko slipped under 
the pink comforter. 

&quot;I&#39;m okay,&quot; answered Himeko. &quot;I&#39;m just a little tired.&quot; 

&quot;I would expect so,&quot; said the taller girl. &quot;After all that happened 
today, I would expect anyone to be tired.&quot; Chikane went to the light 
switch beside the door and turned off the light in the room. Chikane 
proceeded to get into bed beside Himeko. She closed her eyes and wrapped 
her arms around the shorter girl. &quot;I&#39;m tired as well. I just want to lie 
here forever with you in my arms.&quot; 

&quot;Chikane...&quot; was all Himeko could say as she let her body sink into 
Chikane&#39;s arms. 

&quot;Himeko,&quot; said Chikane before the blonde could fall asleep. Himeko 
looked at Chikane, wondering what was on the dark-haired girl&#39;s mind. 
&quot;Ever since we parted last year, I&#39;ve thought about nothing but you. 
Every minute of every day, my thoughts were always filled with you.&quot; 

&quot;My thoughts were with you as well, Chikane,&quot; said Himeko. &quot;Even though 
I didn&#39;t remember anything that happened, any of the time we spent 
together, I still knew that someone was out there, waiting for me. And 
then, today, when I saw you in the street, and I saw that seashell on 
your neck, all of my memories returned to me and I knew that you were 
the one I had been waiting for, the one that I had fallen in love with 
before. I love you, Chikane.&quot; 

&quot;I love you, Himeko.&quot; The two girls embraced each other tightly and 
kissed each other. The love that they felt for each other brought tears 
to their eyes. They were so happy to be together again and to be 
together under the same roof. 

As they kissed, Himeko felt Chikane&#39;s hands start to move. They were 
caressing Himeko&#39;s back. Himeko sighed as she felt Chikane&#39;s hands move 
about her body. Her hands started moving as well, caressing Chikane just 
as Chikane was caressing her. Chikane&#39;s hands moved to Himeko&#39;s front, 
feeling Himeko&#39;s stomach and waist. 

As Chikane moved her hands to Himeko&#39;s breasts, Himeko&#39;s eyes shot open 
and she grabbed Chikane&#39;s hands, stopping their movement. Chikane opened 
her eyes and looked at Himeko. &quot;Himeko?&quot; she asked, surprised by the 
expression in Himeko&#39;s face. It was a look of fear and helplessness, as 
if Himeko was being trapped by something. 

Himeko let go of Chikane&#39;s hands and sank deeper under the comforter. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Chikane,&quot; she said, &quot;but my mind suddenly filled with 
memories of that night. I felt so weak and helpless. I felt violated and 
there was nothing I could do to stop it.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, Himeko...&quot; Chikane said. She remembered what she had done, and she 
could not believe that she had done something so vile to the one that 
she loved. The guilt that Chikane felt brought tears to her eyes. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Chikane,&quot; Himeko said. 

&quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; said Chikane, holding Himeko in her arms. &quot;You have no right to 
say that you&#39;re sorry. It was all my fault. I allowed Orochi&#39;s will to 
consume me and I was the one that hurt you. You showed me nothing but 
kindness and compassion, and I can&#39;t forgive myself for doing something 
so detestable to you. I&#39;m sorry, Himeko. I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Himeko said. &quot;I know that everything you did was for my 
sake. You needed to be hated by me because you killed me in our past 
lives.&quot; 

&quot;What I should have realized was that it isn&#39;t possible for you to hate 
me. Nothing I or anyone can do will make you hate anyone. You aren&#39;t 
capable of such horrible feelings. You are the sun that smiles upon 
everyone and everything. And I should have realized that trying to make 
you hate me was futile. I should have let the past be the past and 
embrace the love that you had for me.&quot; 

&quot;You have my love, Chikane. You&#39;ve always had my love. I love you with 
all my heart, Chikane. But, I&#39;m just...not ready to let myself be 
touched yet.&quot; 

&quot;I understand.&quot; 

&quot;Just hold me and let me sleep in your arms.&quot; 

&quot;Of course.&quot; Chikane did as Himeko wanted and held her beloved Himeko in 
her arms. Himeko curled up and rubbed her head against Chikane&#39;s bosom. 
Chikane&#39;s body felt so warm and Himeko felt so relaxed in her 
girlfriend&#39;s embrace. Even with the memory of how Chikane had attacked 
her, she still felt safe when she was with Chikane. And in Chikane&#39;s 
arms, Himeko easily drifted off to sleep. 

---------- 

Himeko awoke to find bright sunlight shining on her face. It was a 
welcome change to be able to wake up on her own without the aid of a 
roommate or an alarm clock. As the haze of sleep lifted from her eyes, 
Himeko found that the sunlight was shining into the room through a 
window. She also found that someone had her arms around her. Himeko 
looked beside her to see a pair of deep, blue eyes watching her, filled 
with undying love for the person they were looking at. &quot;Good morning, 
Himeko,&quot; said Chikane, her voice holding just as much love as here eyes 
did. 

Himeko smiled and said, &quot;Good morning, Chikane.&quot; She stretched her arms 
out and yawned before lying back down and putting her arms around the 
taller girl. &quot;I&#39;m so happy that I can wake up next to you.&quot; 

&quot;Me too.&quot; The two girls kissed briefly before getting out of bed, 
changing, and heading off to breakfast. 

&quot;Good morning,&quot; said Takeshi as Chikane and Himeko sat down. The 
Himemiyas had just arrived at the table as well. Himeko was thankful 
that the breakfast that morning was not the Japanese-style breakfast 
that she had had one the first day she stayed with Chikane in the other 
reality, the one with shiitake mushrooms. This morning, the breakfast 
was a western-style dish with ham, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce. 

---------- 

Kazuki Ogami paced anxiously about the shrine. &quot;Sensei,&quot; Yukihito said, 
watching his mentor pacing, &quot;why are you so uneasy?&quot; 

&quot;Those girls should have been here by now,&quot; Kazuki answered. 

&quot;You have to give them some time,&quot; responded the college student. &quot;You 
know how young people are, they like to sleep in on Sundays and have 
leisurely breakfasts. They both have a big day ahead of them and they 
need to be in top condition to perform the revival ritual properly.&quot; 

&quot;They will have plenty of time to sleep in and have leisurely breakfasts 
once the evil god Orochi is defeated and the world is safe.&quot; 

&quot;We can&#39;t let that happen,&quot; said an ominous voice from the entrance to 
the shrine. Kazuki and Yukihito looked to see that a tall man with long, 
teal hair had just entered. 

&quot;Tsubasa,&quot; Kazuki breathed at seeing the man enter. 

&quot;Sensei, do you know this man?&quot; asked Yukihito. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Tsubasa. &quot;I am Souma&#39;s real brother.&quot; Yukihito gasped. 
&quot;Our father was abusive. He would beat Souma for no reason whatsoever. I 
worried constantly that one day, he would beat Souma to death.&quot; Then, a 
very somber look appeared on Tsubasa&#39;s face. &quot;And so, I was forced to 
take my own father&#39;s life.&quot; 

Again, Yukihito gasped. &quot;Your own father?&quot; 

&quot;The last thing Souma needed was a brother who was a murderer. And so, I 
left Souma in the care of Keiji Ogami.&quot; 

&quot;Kazuki&#39;s father?&quot; Yukihito said. 

&quot;But you disappeared and weren&#39;t heard from since,&quot; Kazuki said to 
Tsubasa. &quot;Why have you come back?&quot; 

&quot;I have come to warn you,&quot; the tall man said to his step-brother, &quot;that 
the Orochi will come to attack this shrine. Both you and your assistant 
must leave if you are to survive.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;ve come to warn us?&quot; asked Yukihito with a confused look. 

&quot;Why would you want to warn us of such a thing?&quot; asked Kazuki. &quot;That 
would put you at a disadvantage if we knew what was coming.&quot; 

&quot;Souma wanted you to live. His loyalty to his family is admirable, 
whether that family is related to him by blood or not. Souma has grown 
to accept both of you as part of his family, and he refused to let you 
be killed by the Orochi&#39;s attack. But regardless of whether you are here 
or not, the attack is still coming. If you value your lives, will must 
evacuate while you still can.&quot; 

&quot;We can&#39;t let you destroy the Ogami Shrine,&quot; Kazuki said sternly. 

&quot;Then you leave me no choice. Good bye, Kazuki.&quot; With a bow, Tsubasa 
exited the shrine. 

&quot;Tsubasa, wait.&quot; Kazuki ran after Tsubasa. 

&quot;Sensei,&quot; called Yukihito, running after his mentor. However, when the 
two shrine keepers exited the shrine, instead of finding Tsubasa, they 
found three giant mechs standing in front of the shrine, one black mech 
with retractable swords on its arms, one purple mech with a halo on its 
back, and one orange-colored mech in the shape of a wheel. 

---------- 

Chikane and Himeko had finished breakfast and were leaving the Himemiya 
residence to go perform the revival ritual of Ame no Murakumo. &quot;Good 
bye, Mister and Missus Himemiya,&quot; said Chikane as she an Himeko prepared 
to leave. 

&quot;Be sure to send our regards to the god,&quot; Rika said. 

As Chikane and Himeko exited the front door, Chikane caught a glimpse of 
the large tree in front of the house. &quot;I never told you about this tree, 
did I?&quot; she said. 

&quot;No,&quot; replied the shorter girl. 

&quot;I used to climb this tree all the time when I was little. I always 
enjoyed looking upon the world from the treetop. Even when I was told 
not to, I would climb up there anyway. It was just about the only place 
where I could enjoy some peace and quiet without my peers pressuring me 
to be the good daughter of Himemiya-sama.&quot; She said, &quot;Himemiya-sama,&quot; in 
a mocking tone. 

&quot;It&#39;s certainly very secluded. It must have been the perfect getaway.&quot; 

&quot;Almost. One day, Otoha tried to climb up to me. But, she got stuck 
halfway up and it caused quite a commotion. From that day forward, I 
never climbed this tree again.&quot; Chikane reached out and touched the 
tree. &quot;How I long for those days when I could just escape into the 
heavens.&quot; 

&quot;There&#39;s nothing stopping you,&quot; Himeko said with a smile. 

&quot;You think so?&quot; Chikane asked. &quot;You think it would be a good idea for me 
to climb this tree again?&quot; 

&quot;Mm,&quot; Himeko nodded. &quot;You wanted to rebuild your life after being locked 
away in the Lunar Shrine. You can recapture part of your childhood by 
climbing this tree.&quot; 

Chikane smiled and said, &quot;You&#39;re right, Himeko. I&#39;m sure Mister Ogami 
can wait for a few more minutes.&quot; At that, Chikane started climbing the 
tree. 

Chikane was surprised by how easy it was for her to remember where all 
of the handholds were. Within 60 seconds, she was at the highest point 
that was humanly possible. The dark-haired girl looked out upon the 
village from the treetop and smiled. A cool breeze blew through the 
branches and Chikane felt so relaxed as she relived happy memories of 
her childhood. 

Seeing Chikane enjoying that moment warmed Himeko&#39;s heart and she 
started climbing as well. &quot;Himeko?&quot; Chikane said, surprised to see 
Himeko climbing up toward her. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Chikane,&quot; said Himeko. &quot;If I fall, Tsukuyomi no Mikoto 
will catch me, right?&quot; 

&quot;Right,&quot; Chikane said. Himeko smiled and continued climbing. 

At that moment, Otoha rushed out of the house, hoping to say good bye to 
Chikane before she left. However, as she exited the house, she saw that 
Chikane had actually not left yet. She was sitting up on the highest 
branch of the tree outside the house. &#39;Miss Chikane climbed that tree?&#39; 
she thought to herself. &#39;Why does this seem so familiar?&#39; Otoha looked 
again and saw that Himeko was trying to climb up to where Chikane was. 
&#39;Miss Kurusugawa?&#39; Himeko was about halfway up the tree when she had a 
bit of trouble finding a good handhold to proceed. &#39;Wait...&#39; thought 
Otoha, a sense of nostalgia entering her mind. 

Otoha saw Himeko reach for a handhold. Himeko struggled to stretch her 
arm so that she could reach it. Himeko managed to grab the handhold, but 
she lost her footing and started falling. Himeko screamed as she nearly 
plummeted toward the ground. She managed to grab hold of a branch, but 
the only thing separating her from the ground was 5 meters of air. 
&quot;She&#39;ll never make it,&quot; Otoha said to herself casually. 

&quot;Himeko, are you all right?&quot; asked Chikane. 

&quot;I&#39;m stuck,&quot; said a frightened Himeko. 

&quot;You can do it, Himeko,&quot; Chikane said. &quot;I believe in you.&quot; 

Chikane&#39;s words of encouragement allowed Himeko to find the courage to 
try to continue climbing. Himeko tried to wrap her legs around the 
branch that she was holding on to. Himeko attempted and failed several 
times. &#39;I tried the same thing,&#39; Otoha thought to herself. &#39;I managed to 
wrap my legs around that branch, but I still couldn&#39;t get to the top.&#39; 
Then, a confused expression came across Otoha&#39;s face. &#39;But how could I 
have done that? I never climbed that tree.&#39; 

Eventually, Himeko managed to wrap her legs around the branch. She was 
now holding on to that branch with both her arms and legs. Still, the 
branch was above her. She had to find some way around the branch without 
falling. &quot;There&#39;s no way you can do it,&quot; said Otoha smugly. 

Then, Himeko did something that Otoha had not anticipated. She let go of 
the branch with her left arm, continuing to hold on with her legs and 
right arm. Himeko then grabbed on to the branch with her left hand 
again, but on the same side of the branch as her right arm. Still firmly 
gripping the branch with her legs and right arm, Himeko used her left 
hand to push against the top of the branch, pushing herself up. &quot;Is 
she...?&quot; Otoha said. 

&quot;Come on, Himeko,&quot; Chikane said. &quot;You can do it!&quot; 

Himeko used all the strength she could muster to push herself up with 
only her left hand. The shorter girl inched closer and closer to the top 
of the branch. Then, Himeko&#39;s strength ran out. She could not push with 
her left arm any more, or hold on with her legs and right arm. Gravity 
took over and Himeko fell...onto the branch. &quot;NO WAY!&quot; Otoha cried. 

Himeko panted heavily after using up all of her strength. &quot;Great job, 
Himeko!&quot; Chikane beamed. &quot;I knew you could do it.&quot; 

&#39;I don&#39;t believe it,&#39; Otoha puzzled. &#39;She managed to get up onto the 
branch from below it!&#39; 

Having passed that difficult halfway point, Himeko only had a few more 
branches to climb before she got to Chikane, which she did easy after 
recovering for a few moments. Otoha looked up in awe of the two girls 
sitting on that high branch. Just then, the maid remembered something 
that had happened many years before. She had looked up at that tree from 
where she was standing and saw a 6-year-old girl sitting on that branch 
that Chikane and Himeko were sitting on. The 6-year-old girl had 
bluish-black hair and deep, blue eyes, much like Chikane. Otoha then 
realized that the 6-year-old WAS Chikane! 

Otoha remembered coming to work for the Himemiya family 11 years before. 
She had looked up at that tree and saw 6-year-old Chikane sitting up in 
that tree, reading a book. Several days later, Otoha had tried climbing 
that tree to where Chikane was, but she had gotten stuck in the exact 
same place that Himeko had. However, she was unable to climb up on top 
of the branch. Ever since that day, Otoha had done all she could to care 
for Chikane, but what she really wanted was to care for her not as a 
servant, but as an equal. She worked for Chikane for 10 years, but could 
never do anything but look up to her. 

Otoha remembered it all so clearly. The strange feelings that she had 
been having since Chikane and Himeko had moved in made sense. She had no 
idea how or why, but even though she had met Chikane only the day 
before, she had known Chikane ever since she started working at the 
Himemiya residence. She admired Chikane every minute of every day of 
every year since she first set eyes on her. And as she and Chikane grew 
up, Otoha realized that her feelings were more than just admiration. She 
was in love with Chikane! However, she could never declare her love 
because she was Chikane&#39;s servant. 

And then, there she was, looking up at Chikane yet again. However, this 
time, there was someone sitting up in that tree with Chikane. A person 
that was able to overcome the obstacle that Otoha could not. It had 
taken 11 years and a passage into a new reality, but Otoha finally 
realized that becoming Chikane&#39;s lover was a lost cause. The only time 
that Chikane was truly happy was when she was with Himeko. And it was 
only when Chikane was happy that Otoha felt that she had done something 
helpful. Even though she could never be Chikane&#39;s lover, she still felt 
a sense of satisfaction that she had done something to make Chikane 
happy or avoid doing something that would keep Chikane from being happy. 

Now that Otoha finally understood the strange feelings that she had been 
having since Chikane and Himeko moved in, she turned around and headed 
back into the house. And although she knew that she could not be with 
Chikane the way that she wanted, she still smiled at the fact that the 
person she loved could be happy. 

&quot;I made it, Chikane,&quot; Himeko breathed. &quot;I actually made it up to you.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re strong, Himeko,&quot; cooed Chikane. &quot;You&#39;re much stronger than you 
look.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m not strong,&quot; Himeko said. Resting her head on Chikane&#39;s shoulder, 
she finished, &quot;But our love is.&quot; Himeko then took her shell pendant in 
her hand and Chikane&#39;s shell pendant in the other. &quot;We&#39;re two halves of 
the same bivalve,&quot; she said. &quot;The bond that we have is stronger than 
anything else. The strength of our love gave me the strength to climb up 
to you. It gave you the strength to find your way back to me.&quot; 

&quot;Himeko...&quot; Chikane leaned toward Himeko and they kissed again. At that 
moment, everything seemed perfect. The cool breeze in the air, the warm 
sun shining down on them. It was only Himeko, Chikane, and the heavens. 

Suddenly, the perfect moment came crashing down as a booming voice 
echoed throughout the valley, &quot;Megaton Knuckle!&quot; 

&quot;That voice...&quot; Chikane said. A giant, brown, mechanical arm came flying 
toward the estate from across the valley. As the arm came in front of 
the tree, it opened up and a gold-colored mech came out of it. &quot;Hi no 
Ashinazuchi!&quot; cried Chikane, recognizing Orochi&#39;s third body. 

The branch that Himeko and Chikane were sitting on was at eye-level with 
the monstrous god and its devilish, red eyes stared right at Himeko. 
From Hi no Ashinazuchi came a gruff voice, &quot;I found you, Hime!&quot; 

---------- 

OMAKE: 

Otoha saw Himeko reach for a handhold. Himeko struggled to stretch her 
arm so that she could reach it. Himeko managed to grab the handhold, but 
she lost her footing and started falling. Himeko screamed as she nearly 
plummeted toward the ground. She managed to grab hold of a branch, but 
the only thing separating her from the ground was 5 meters of air. 
&quot;She&#39;ll never make it,&quot; Otoha said to herself casually. 

Himeko tried to wrap her legs around the branch that she was holding on 
to. She tried several times, but failed. Then, her hands slipped and 
Himeko started falling. 

Meanwhile, Mako was recovering form her injuries at Kamiyatate 
University Medical Center. As she lay in bed, a dreadful feelings came 
over the brown-haired girl. She said to herself, &quot;It&#39;s as if Himeko 
cried out in terror but then suddenly silenced.&quot; She looked out the 
window and said, &quot;You fell down again, didn&#39;t you, Himeko?&quot;
