<h2>a <a href="../kannazuki/index.html">Kannazuki no Miko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jenchan.html">Jen-chan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>SPOILER WARNING: Spoilers for the entire series exist in this fanfic. 
Do not read on if you don&#39;t want to know how the story ends.

CONTINUITY NOTE: This fanfic takes place in the same universe as a 
previous KnM fic of mine, Finally Healing. No knowledge of that fic is 
required to understand this one, save for the following plot points:

1) This fic takes place when Chikane and Himeko are in their early 
twenties, fresh out of college. Chikane has been reborn as Miyahime 
Chikane. Still coming from a well privileged family, she has a budding 
career as a pianist. Neither she, nor Himeko (nor anyone else for that 
matter) retain memories of their previous written-over lives, save for 
fragmented dreams.

2) Otoha-san was in the employment of the Himemiya family until about 
the same time that Chikane returned to Japan from studying abroad. She 
is now employed as Chikane&#39;s maid and loving her job.

3) Souma and Makoto have fallen in love and are about to be married.

SYNOPSIS: An accident robs Chikane of her vision temporarily. The 
disability causes her to push those closest to her away. But they will 
not be so easily deterred... 

Comments and Criticisms are greatly appreciated!

**********************************************************************


Miyahime Chikane&#39;s screaming - shrilly, painfully - was a sound that 
Kurusugawa Himeko was never going to be able to forget. Nor would the 
sight of the usually tall, graceful woman, bent over in shock and 
searing agony, clutching at her flimsy plastic goggles as toxic 
chemicals meant for film development dripped through her bangs into her 
eyes, be a sight that would ever leave Himeko&#39;s memory again. 

For the millionth time in the last two hours, as she sat shivering and 
hunched over on the cold, impersonal hospital bench, Himeko wondered 
how a simple outing to see her new place of employment could have ended 
so disastrously. Had it been a prank - a cruel trick played out of 
jealousy and resentment? Even amateur students knew that chemicals were 
to be kept in the bottom drawers, precisely to prevent what had 
occurred from ever happening. And, of course, all bottles were to be 
properly and tightly sealed at all times - that step was even listed on 
the safety checklist, posted on the darkroom door!

Oh why - why why why why why?! - had that bottle of stop bath teetered 
twice and then fallen directly on top of Chikane&#39;s head, when Himeko 
had idly suggested to her lover to look in an overhead cabinet for 
paper towels?

Himeko heard Otoha Keiko sniff and out of the corner of her eyes, 
noticed the maid raise a white handkerchief to her face once more, 
silently weeping. Seeing the older woman&#39;s shoulders shaking so made 
the blonde photographer almost wish that Otoha would scream at her, or 
slap her again, as she had when she&#146;d first gotten to the hospital. The 
wordless accusations were far less bearable...

&quot;Kurusugawa Himeko?&quot;

Himeko jerked her head up and saw a white coated doctor gazing tiredly 
down at her.

Otoha leapt to her feet beside Himeko and grabbed the doctor&#39;s arm 
before Himeko even had a chance to stand up. &quot;Doctor! How is Ojou-sama? 
How is she??&quot;

The doctor gave the woman a slightly perturbed once over as if to ask 
who she was before sighing. &quot;We were lucky that the safety glasses kept 
the entire bottle from emptying into her eyes, but as it is, there&#39;s 
still extensive damage. We managed to flush all of it out, and it&#39;s 
looking good for a recovery but you also need to understand that 
permanent blindness may also be a possibility...&quot;

Otoha&#39;s face grew even more ashen. The doctor gave a yelp when she 
tightened her grip. &quot;How can you say that?!&quot; She cried manically, &quot;how 
can you even say recovery and permanent blindness in the same 
sentence?! It doesn&#39;t make sense! You-&quot;

Himeko didn&#39;t listen to the rest of Otoha&#39;s harsh words at the doctor 
as she quietly got to her feet and walked quickly passed him, into the 
room he had just exited.

Chikane sat in an ugly bed in the middle of the sterile room, her face 
turned away from the door. Himeko could see a piece of white gauze 
wrapped several times around her lover&#39;s head. Silently, she padded 
across the room. With a shaking hand, she pulled one of the chairs 
resting against the wall towards the bed, and sat down on it. 

The scrapping of the chair legs against the floor finally prompted 
Chikane to start in surprise, sitting up straight and hesitantly 
turning to face the noise. 

&quot;Himeko?&quot; Chikane&#39;s voice sounded quiet and unsure - uncharacteristic 
tones that caused Himeko&#39;s heart to wrench tightly. She opened her 
mouth, but as she noticed how Chikane was looking just to the left of 
where she was sitting, Himeko found that she wasn&#39;t able to answer her 
beloved&#39;s trepid call. Instead, as tears came unbidden to Himeko&#39;s 
eyes, she could only reach out, and timidly touch Chikane&#39;s hands, 
resting atop the thin sheets that covered the resting woman. 
Immediately, Chikane grasped Himeko&#39;s hands back, tightly, more than 
desperately. 

The blue-black haired woman smiled gratefully and leaned back against 
the pillows that were supporting her. &quot;It _is_ you, Himeko.&quot;

Words still refusing to come to her, Himeko could only nod, even though 
she knew the other woman couldn&#39;t see the affirmation. 

Silence of a not entirely comfortable nature continued to permeate 
through the room, and though Himeko herself couldn&#39;t break it, she 
wished that Chikane wouldn&#39;t feel the need to break it for her. 
Listening to her lover speak so softly, and watching her try so 
valiantly to make everything seem all right, only made Himeko feel that 
much more despair.

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine. I need to keep them bandaged and away from light for the 
next three weeks, and then the chances of a good recovery will be more 
than eighty percent.&quot; Chikane&#39;s voice grew ever softer. &quot;It probably 
won&#39;t be a full recovery, but the doctors are confident that most-&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; 

Himeko finally found her voice as those tears in her eyes finally spilt 
over. They caused her hard found words to break and crack. 

&quot;Himeko...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry!&quot; And now that she found 
her words, she couldn&#39;t seem to stop them. &quot;I&#39;m sorry! I shouldn&#39;t 
have... I shouldn&#39;t have... oh, gods, Chikane-chan, I&#39;m so sorry...! 
This is all my... this is all my... fault...&quot;

Himeko felt Chikane reach out for her, and eventually touch fingers 
against her face. They wiped away the tears that streamed down her 
cheeks, and then those fingers reached behind her head to pull her into 
a delicate embrace against Chikane&#39;s chest. 

&quot;Shh...&quot; Chikane soothed. Himeko felt the warmth of her beloved&#39;s cheek 
atop her head.

&quot;It wasn&#39;t your fault. It wasn&#39;t anyone&#39;s fault. Perhaps... perhaps 
this is just karma...&quot;

Himeko shook her head furiously. &quot;No! No, Chikane-chan, if karma were 
working properly, then this would never have happened! For 
everything... for everything you&#39;ve done... you deserve nothing but the 
best. Nothing but happily ever after...&quot;

The blonde photographer felt slight rumbles of mirth in Chikane&#39;s 
chest. &quot;But Himeko, I already have my happily ever after. I have you, 
don&#39;t I?&quot; Here, once again, Chikane&#39;s voice grew pensive in that way 
that made Himeko&#39;s heart ache. &quot;You... you&#39;ll stay with me through 
this, won&#39;t you?&quot;  

Himeko&#39;s eyes widened before she squeezed them tightly shut again. 
She wrapped her arms firmly around Chikane&#39;s body. &quot;H-how could you 
even question that?! Of course I will!&quot; 

She felt more purr-like chuckles rumble through Chikane&#39;s chest. &quot;Then 
everything will be just fine.&quot;

The confidence and security in her lover&#39;s voice tugged at the corner 
of Himeko&#39;s lips and she closed her eyes again. She hoped Chikane-chan 
was right. Dearly so. 


***


In truth, Miyahime Chikane was not as certain as she had let her 
beloved to believe. Whilst she had listened calmly to the doctors speak 
about her chances, and had managed to relay the information 
confidently, almost nonchalantly, back to Himeko and Otoha-san when the 
maid had come into the room, she felt an acute sense of panic when the 
nurse shooed her most loved ones out of the room an untraceable length 
of time later, stating that visiting time was over many, many hours 
ago, and that the best thing they could do for Chikane was to let her 
rest.

Unfortunately, the &#39;rest&#39; that the doctors claimed was so necessary to 
her recovery, was anything but restful. A myriad of disturbing images 
taunted and cackled cruelly at her. The most chilling dream was that of 
a malevolently spiraling maw of dark despair that kept engulfing her 
over and over whilst a deep booming voice proclaimed she would forever 
wander in darkness, a creature of the moon, separated from the sun, 
never to see daybreak again. 

The worst part was that the voice was proved correct, when Chikane 
awoke 
to the sensation of someone shaking her arm, telling her to wake up, 
since it was already morning, and she couldn&#39;t make out anything at all 
save for an unending expanse of inky, lonely, blackness.

She clung desperately to whomever - whatever - it was at her arm, 
gasping plainly and feeling dizzy. &quot;It&#39;s dark!!&quot; She cried loudly, her 
own voice shrill in her ears. &quot;I can&#39;t see! Oh god, I can&#39;t- I 
can&#39;t...!&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s alright. It&#39;s alright, Miyahime-san. I&#39;m right here. You&#39;re not 
alone.&quot;

Chikane continued to gasp. Gradually, mercifully, her memory came back 
to her, pushing the roiling horror in her stomach down. It still took 
several minutes - was it just a few minutes? Gods it was so hard to 
tell - more for her manically thumping heart to stop trying to leap out 
of her chest.  

There had been an accident. She was in the hospital. Her eyes were 
bandaged and would remain that way for the next three weeks and six 
days.

Twenty-seven loooong and agonizing days...

Chikane tried to swallow, but her throat was parched and she ended up 
coughing. &quot;T-thank you, nurse.&quot; She finally managed to place the voice 
that had awaken her. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I... I forgot where I was.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s alright, it&#39;s perfectly understandable. You&#39;re doing very 
well.&quot; The voice was kind, but rather impersonal. The nurse must have 
said this a lot. &quot;It&#39;s just a little bit past eight in the morning 
right now, and I&#39;ve got some cream for your eyes. After we get you 
cleaned up a bit, would you like some breakfast?&quot; 

&quot;Please, no.&quot; Chikane shook her head weakly. &quot;I don&#39;t want food at 
all.&quot; 

&quot;Hmm... well, alright, but you&#39;re going to have to eat eventually, 
okay?&quot; 

Chikane nodded weakly. The nurse undid the bandages around her head, 
and took off the patches and coverings over Chikane&#39;s eyes, telling her 
to take care not to open them. Even though Chikane followed the nurse&#39;s 
advice, still she felt an almost searing and unbearable brightness 
through her eyelids. The nurse cleaned around her injury, and redressed 
her wounds. 

&quot;Alright, that should do it. I need to go make my rounds now, but is 
there anything else I can get for you? Headphones?&quot;

Chikane felt a surge of fear run through her mind, but she refused to 
let it show. &quot;Headphones would... be nice. Excuse me, Nurse, but how 
long must I stay here?&quot;

&quot;Hmm, I suspect they&#39;ll want to keep you here for observation for a 
couple more days, but I&#39;ll check for you, alright?&quot;

&quot;Yes, thank you...&quot;

In the end, Chikane raised enough of a dignified fuss to convince the 
doctors to let her go home the next morning. She had never felt more 
relieved to return home than that day. A very tired sort of relief 
washed over her when she heard Otoha-san open the front door with a 
click.

&quot;Welcome home, Chikane-chan!&quot;

Hearing Himeko&#39;s unexpected voice caused much of the wariness in 
Chikane&#39;s limbs to dissipate. Her heart leapt happily into her throat.
&quot;Himeko? Is that you?&quot; She reached out blindly, panicking when she 
couldn&#146;t find Himeko right away. But soon, she felt her beloved gently 
grab her elbow. At the same time, Otoha-san reluctantly released her 
other one, and she could hear her maid step quietly back.
 
&quot;Yes it is! I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t come with Otoha-san to pick you up 
from the hospital.&quot; Himeko&#146;s voice was sorrowful, and Chikane wanted
very much to take that sorrow and fling it into the sun.

&quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; Chikane replied. She paused. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be at work 
now?&quot;

&quot;The company is letting me take a leave of absence,&quot; Himeko explained 
quietly. 

Chikane could almost hear what Himeko had left unspoken. 

&quot;Chikane-chan, I... is it alright if I stayed with you? Until you get 
better?&quot;

Chikane felt a warm smile spread on her face. Really, why did Himeko
even feel the need to ask! &quot;Of course, Himeko. I would most appreciate 
it.&quot;

Though it wasn&#39;t exactly normal for a junior staff member to be able to 
take so much time off, unpaid or otherwise, Himeko&#39;s superiors were 
still trembling with fear at the prospect of a lawsuit. She moved into 
the guest bedroom in name, though in practice, she shared Chikane&#39;s 
bed every night. 

Chikane spent her days eternally grateful for her lover&#39;s patient 
presence at her side, helping her to re-familiarize herself to her 
home. She felt an acute sense of helpless frustration when it took her 
the better part of two days for her to find her way through all the 
rooms in her home without help - not that Himeko or Otoha-san would let 
her be by herself for too long.

Night quickly became Chikane&#39;s favorite time. The darkness of night 
allowed her to forget that everything in her world was now dark, and as 
she laid together with Himeko, bodies lightly touching and voices low 
in quiet conversation, Chikane could almost feel like everything was 
alright again.


***


The incessantly upbeat and cheerful tone from Himeko&#39;s cell phone woke 
both she and Chikane up the next morning. Normally slow to rise, Himeko 
gave a murmur of protest when her lover rolled away from her, robbing 
her of that blissful, secure warmth only Chikane&#39;s arms could give. 
Cracking her eyes open just a smidge, it took a few moments for Himeko 
to recognize the other woman&#39;s form, blindly but patiently patting at 
one of the night tables for the black eye mask that rested there.

Himeko began to reach over to help the other woman, but the cell phone 
demanded instant attention. With a sigh, Himeko rolled over herself, 
swinging her legs reluctantly off the bed into a sitting position. She 
picked the annoying device off the night table on her side of the bed 
and sleepily silenced it with a flick.

&quot;Mmmm?&quot; Himeko asked as intelligently as possible at such an ungodly 
hour.

&quot;Oh. My. God. Himeko, call that chorus of angels and let the trumpets 
of triumph blare! My life&#39;s journey is finally complete - I have found 
the _perfect_ centerpieces!!&quot;

Himeko crinkled her nose. &quot;M-Mako-chan?&quot; She croaked.

&quot;D&#39;uh! Who else gets away with waking you this early in the morning! 
For which I apologize! Erm, well, not really, but oh, Himeko, these 
little flower glaze glass thingies are just the cutest things I&#39;ve ever 
laid eyes on! God, I wish you were here now, so you could tell me if I 
should go with the froggies or the dragonflies!&quot;

Frogs? Dragonflies? Wish she were where now??

The last traces of sleep suddenly blinked clear from Himeko&#39;s eyes as 
her best friend&#39;s words finally registered in her mind. &quot;Ohmigod, Mako-
chan! Your wedding!&quot;

&quot;...&quot; 

There was a pregnant pause over the line and Himeko could just _hear_ 
the ellipses of exasperation in Saotome (soon to be Oogami) Makoto&#39;s 
silence.

&quot;Aaaalright, Himeko, this had _better_ be good. What. Do. You. Mean, 
&#39;omigod Mako-chan your wedding&#39;?&quot; There was a very dangerous halting in 
the normally cheerful brunette&#39;s words. 

Himeko swallowed, hastily looking over her shoulder. Chikane had 
affixed the eye mask over the white gauze wrapped around her head, 
which had loosened precariously throughout the night. The pretty woman 
was looking in Himeko&#39;s general direction, head cocked cutely to one 
side, gorgeous hair in a sexy muss.

A pang of heartache flared briefly in Himeko&#39;s chest and she turned 
away from her lover. Cupping a hand over the microphone on her cell, 
Himeko spoke softly.

&quot;Mako-chan, I... I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able to make it...&quot;

&quot;WHAT?!&quot;

Himeko winced as she held the phone away from her ear. But before she 
could bring it back, she felt a familiar hand touch a shoulder blade 
timidly, then glide carefully up her shoulder and down her arm before 
grabbing the phone from her outstretched hand. &quot;Chikane-chan!&quot; Himeko 
turned to face her beloved who was already speaking into the device 
smoothly.

&quot;Good morning, is this Saotome Makoto-san?&quot; Chikane asked politely. 
&quot;It&#39;s very nice to finally hear your voice, Saotome-san. My name is 
Miyahime Chika- &quot; She paused and chuckled softly. &quot;Y-yes, I suppose I 
am the infamous lover... yes, I&#39;ve been looking forward to meeting you 
in person too, but, unfortunately, I was in an accident a few days ago 
and I don&#39;t think... oh, no, I&#39;ll be fine. I must be careful for the 
next few weeks, but I&#39;ll be fine... right. Yes, no, it&#39;s alright, I&#39;d 
prefer not to go into the details but the point of the matter is that 
Himeko is worrying needlessly over me which is why she said what she 
did... no, you&#39;re perfectly right, as the Maid of Honor, she really 
must be there... yes... yes, that&#39;s right... Please take my most humble 
regrets at not being able to attend your most important day.... oh, of 
course! Of course... yes, you take care now too, thank you. I&#39;m going 
to hand you back. It was nice to speak with you, Makoto-san.&quot;

Chikane held the phone back in Himeko&#39;s direction silently.

The blonde stared at the phone and then at her lover and then back at 
the phone. Finally, she took it and placed it to her lips. &quot;Mako-chan?&quot; 
The brunette began speaking at a thousand words a minute, such that 
Himeko could only catch two in seven and wasn&#39;t able to interject 
with even one of her own. As she struggled to get Makoto&#39;s attention, 
she looked despairingly over at Chikane, whom had already carefully 
fingered her way out of bed, found a wall, and was following it with 
slow, precise steps to her ensuite bathroom.

&quot;Mako-chan, please, I can&#39;t talk now,&quot; Himeko finally managed to break 
into the conversation. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;ll call you back, alright?&quot; 
Not waiting for an answer, Himeko hung up and swiftly made her way over 
to the bathroom.

Chikane had already taken off the temporary eye mask and was attempting 
to unwind the gauze. Fresh protective coverings, gauze and a white 
blindfold were sitting on the sink. Wordlessly, Himeko reached up to 
help her lover, touching Chikane&#39;s fingers gently. Chikane gave a soft 
murmur of disapproval.

&quot;It&#39;s alright, Himeko. I want to be able to do this myself.&quot;

The blonde woman warred with herself internally, refusing to retract 
her hand. &quot;... but you don&#39;t have to.&quot; She lowered her eyes sadly. &quot;You 
didn&#39;t have to do that for Mako-chan either...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve been helping her with wedding plans for over a year now, 
Himeko.&quot; Chikane replied softly. &quot;And you&#39;re her Maid of Honor. She 
needs you there. You&#39;ll regret it if you don&#39;t go.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll regret it more if I&#39;m not here for you when you most need me!&quot; 
Himeko cried.

The awkward silence made the room feel thick and stuffy. Himeko could 
feel Chikane being to tremble. Suddenly, the tall woman whirled around, 
pulling her into a tight embrace. Himeko felt a moment of 
disorientation
at the sudden movement.

&quot;Please, Himeko. Let me be selfish? If I... If I never... I couldn&#39;t 
bare the thought of holding you back. Go. For me?&quot;

And even though the strong, proud woman hadn&#39;t said it, Himeko could 
understand Chikane&#39;s deep fear through her trembling frame. 

Himeko closed her eyes, and wished she could be as strong as her 
Chikane-chan was.


***


It was best this way. That was what Chikane kept telling herself as she 
sat at her piano bench, back ram-rod straight, fingers intertwined 
together and resting in her lap. The clock in the room bonged ten 
o&#39;clock in the evening.

Five hours since Himeko had left to catch her train. Sixty one more 
until she&#39;d come back.

What if her vision never returned? What if she was fated to a life of 
permanent blindness? Would she tether Himeko to her side forever? Doom 
her beloved to a life chained to an invalid?

As much as the thought haunted her, hurt her head and sent waves of 
nausea to her stomach, still Chikane forced herself to deal with the 
possibility. The risk and likelihood were far too high for her to put 
off planning for the eventuality until it arrived on her doorstep.

There was a quiet knock at the door, followed by the tell-tale click of 
it opening and closing. The soft sounds of slippered feet then padded 
across the room, stopping a few feet away from her. Chikane could feel 
the presence of her maid and turned to face her direction. 

&quot;Ojou-sama... it&#39;s really past time for dinner...&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Otoha-san, but I&#39;m still not very hungry. Could you please 
give Chef my regrets?&quot;

There was an awkward pause before Otoha spoke again, tone unsure. &quot;Are 
you sure that&#39;s wise, Ojou-sama? I mean, you barely touched your lunch, 
and your afternoon tea is still sitting beside you...&quot;

&quot;I appreciate your concern, Otoha-san, but yes, I am fine.&quot; Chikane 
gave what she hoped was a soothing smile. 

&quot;If... you insist, Ojou-sama.&quot; 

A moment later, and Chikane could hear the brief clatter of the 
untouched tray on the stand beside her being picked up.

&quot;There were a couple of telephone calls earlier. Your agent would like 
to pass on the message to you that he is deeply regretful of your 
injury and would like to wish for your most rapid recovery. He will 
speak with the rest of the Fateful Night staff on Monday and the 
concert 
will be canceled.&quot;

Chikane nodded, turning back to face her piano. She wondered how 
agitated her agent was. Fateful Night was supposed to have been her 
first solo performance in Japan. Tickets had been sold out for several 
weeks already, and the buzz on the scene had been palpable. It was a 
pity; Chikane would have liked very much to have Himeko finally come to 
her debut.

&quot;The second call was from Goshuujin-sama. Your agent felt it was 
pertinent to inform your parents of the situation and they will be 
returning as soon as they can.&quot;

Chikane frowned. That was rather odd. &quot;I see. Do they know when they 
will return?&quot;

&quot;No. It seems that Goshuujin-sama is unable to leave negotiations with 
the Ogasawara Zaibatsu without suffering significant setbacks, so...&quot;

Ah. The sounded more right. Whilst her parents had ensured that she 
received the best education and opportunities money could buy, their 
presence was one thing they could never seem to afford. She hadn&#39;t seen 
them in years. So, &#39;soon&#39; was a very relative word.

&quot;Thank you, Otoha-san.&quot; Chikane politely intoned. &quot;If there&#39;s nothing 
else, then you may retire for the evening.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Ojou-sama. Thank you.&quot; The slight clinking of the cutlery told 
Chikane that Otoha-san had turned around, but when the clinking 
continued, and the maid&#39;s presence continued to make itself known, 
Chikane turned to the other woman&#39;s general direction once more.

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Ojou-sama,&quot; there was more than a hint of nervousness in Otoha&#39;s 
voice. &quot;Since... since you have so graciously offered me an early 
retirement this evening, may... may I request that I spent it in the 
accompaniment of yourself and perhaps a few ballads?&quot;

Chikane lifted her eyebrows in surprise. &quot;You&#39;d like me to play for 
you?&quot;

&quot;If you wouldn&#39;t mind too terribly much...&quot; Now Otoha&#39;s voice was 
almost gushing.

Chikane considered this before nodding. &quot;Alright, I think I can manage 
that much. What would you have me play?&quot;

The clinking sounds signified that Otoha had put down the dishes once 
more. There was a brief pause before Chikane heard her maid&#39;s voice 
again, this time further away, and to her other side, where she knew 
several comfortable armchairs were arranged. &quot;Anything you desire, 
Ojou-sama, from your own repertoire, please.&quot; 

The young pianist felt a small smile crack the face. &quot;I&#39;ve been 
practicing those for weeks on end, for the concert. Are you sure you&#39;re 
not sick of them?&quot;

&quot;Never, Ojou-sama.&quot; Otoha&#39;s voice was oddly vehement. &quot;Never.&quot;

So Chikane accommodated, putting her fingers to the ivories. She began 
with the songs she&#39;d first penned while in adolescence, the ones that 
had first gotten her noticed from amongst all the other faces, the ones 
that spoke of a haunting loneliness while trapped for an eternity of 
solitude, of a confused longing for an unrequited time that never was, 
of the ache of a painfully familiar face caught perfectly in a dream, 
yet rendered _just_ blurrily beyond recognition in life. 

These songs were hit and miss. While some listeners found them brimming 
with delicious agony, others found the intensity too plain a force to 
contemplate. She hadn&#39;t played these songs in a while - ever since 
Himeko had walked into her life. She hadn&#39;t needed to, until now.

Her fingers took on lives of their own, dancing down unfamiliar paths, 
composing a requiem of regret by ear. Solemn notes chased fleeting 
moments of happiness through the wind, until they dissipated into 
emptiness. Strains of melancholy blew at candles of hope that struggled 
once, twice, and then were no more. 

And as her fingers hit the final keys, and those notes sounded 
mournfully and faded to nothing, Chikane became aware of labored, 
forced breathing in the room.

&quot;Otoha-san?&quot;

Her maid made some hasty noises to try to calm herself but not before 
Chikane could tell she was crying. 

&quot;Otoha-san, are you alright?&quot; Standing up from her seat, Chikane took 
several uncertain steps towards the sounds before stopping.

&quot;That... that was beautiful, Ojou-sama.&quot; Otoha said &#150; hiccupped - her 
voice growing closer. And then Chikane could feel her maid grasp her 
elbow uncertainly. &quot;It was new, wasn&#39;t it? I didn&#39;t recognize it.&quot;

Chikane nodded, suddenly feeling drained. She let her maid guide her 
out of the music room, feeling a small comfort that Otoha-san would 
know her desire to retire to her chambers. &quot;Yes, I suppose it was.&quot;

&quot;What do you call it?&quot; 

The pianist considered this silently for a moment. 

Happiness followed by regret. Hope followed by loss. Wholeness turned 
to lonely dust.

There was only one appropriate name for this piece.

&quot;Yahari.&quot; Chikane finally decided.

Yahari. As expected.

Silently, faithfully, Otoha Keiko helped her Ojou-sama to re-dress 
wounds, and undress clothing. Tenderly, she smoothed the healing cream 
that could mean the difference between future and death over swollen 
flesh, before ensuring that the gauze was tight enough to protect 
damaged eyes, while loose enough to allow her Ojou-sama a reasonably 
comfortable rest. 

She brushed out Chikane&#39;s long hair lovingly, stroke by maddeningly 
careful stroke, until the blue-black curtain shimmered softly, seeming 
to dance in the dim glow of the room.

She put her charge to bed, pulling the covers up and whispering a soft 
goodnight.

She walked to the bedroom door, turned off the light, opened the 
door... and then shut it again. Then she silently waited for her eyes 
to adjust to the dark - wondering if this was what Ojou-sama&#39;s world 
was like - before sitting in one of the chairs that dotted Ojou-sama&#39;s 
room, and silently watched the beautiful woman sleep.

Chikane fell into a very deep sleep very shortly thereafter, and Keiko 
felt the knots in her chest relax ever so slightly as she gazed 
longingly at the peaceful expression on the younger woman&#39;s face. 

One hour, two hours, Keiko couldn&#39;t tell how many hours had passed but 
she deemed it cruelly not enough before that peaceful expression she 
treasured so much was lost to groans of fitfulness and gasps of 
struggle. 

Alarmed, Keiko headed over to her Ojou-sama&#39;s bedside immediately, 
feeling a great piercing in her chest that she could not sooth her most 
loved one&#39;s hurt beyond gingerly brushing aside Chikane&#39;s hair and 
cooing softly and wordlessly, without giving away her presence.

Keiko watched helplessly as Chikane tossed, hands clenching and 
unclenching, the nightmares relentlessly seizing her until all her 
horrors welled up into a tiny, child-like voice, begging, &quot;Himeko... 
please... don&#39;t leave me...&quot;

Keiko felt her heart crash into her stomach as she heard her Ojou-
sama&#39;s plea. &#39;She&#39;s not here&#39;, she wanted to say. &#39;That foolish woman 
listened to your words, Ojou-sama, not your heart...&#39;

But Keiko... Keiko knew how to listen to her Ojou-sama&#39;s heart. 

Silently, she moved away from the bed, out the room and down the hall, 
careful to open and close the door with not a lick of sound.

She walked quickly to Kurusugawa-sama&#39;s room, went straight to the 
drawers and pulled out a pair of the blonde woman&#39;s pajamas. Moving 
purposefully, she went to the bathroom and undressed. Spying her Ojou-
sama&#39;s most beloved&#39;s shampoos, body washes and perfumes, she carefully 
picked one up, and began to wash...

Himeko was dressed in a beige sweater and a teal blue pleated skirt. A 
string of pearls rested around her neck and her hair was done up in 
twin braids. It was a Himeko whom Chikane knew she hadn&#39;t met in this 
life. The girl was far younger than even when they had first met. But 
she was still unmistakably, irrevocably, her beloved. 

Himeko&#39;s voice was soft, sweet, lovetorn. &quot;You told me the story of the 
seashells before, right, Chikane-chan? How there&#39;s just one person 
waiting for me...&quot;

Chikane smiled a bittersweet smile, glad the other girl was not looking 
at her, and yet also aching with the wish that the one Himeko saw in 
the distance was herself. &quot;Yes, I remember...&quot;

The corners of Himeko&#39;s mouth turned up shyly, heart-breakingly so. &quot;I 
think that unique person waiting for me... might be Souma-kun. When I&#39;m 
with Souma-kun, my heart races, so rapidly...&quot;

And as Himeko&#39;s voice trailed off, Chikane felt her own shrivel up and 
die in her throat. Unbidden, unwanted, a cruel voice echoed through her 
head.

&#145;Your love, will never be requited...&#146;

Chikane swallowed. She impulsively grabbed Himeko and pulled her 
into a tight embrace against her chest.

Himeko made a noise of surprise. &quot;Chikane-chan?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m happy for you,&quot; Chikane whispered. She kept her head lifted, 
gazing forlornly upwards as tears welled up in her eyes. &quot;I&#39;m happy for 
you...&quot;

And then, suddenly, Himeko disappeared from her arms. Alarmed, Chikane 
looked wildly all around the room, before she saw her beloved standing 
a few feet from her. 

Himeko&#39;s hair was shorter now; she was a few years older. She was _her_ 
Himeko. She wore a regretful expression as she held onto her suitcase. 
She looked over her shoulder once, and then turned back to regard 
Chikane, eyes brimming with unshed tears. &quot;Well then... if this is what 
you really want...&quot; This was what Himeko had said before she&#39;d left for 
the wedding. &quot;Goodbye...&quot;

Chikane clenched her fists. 

No. Of course that wasn&#39;t what she wanted! How could it be?!

&quot;Himeko!!&quot; Chikane leapt forward, trying to grasp her beloved in her 
arms. Instead, she fell headlong into a spiraling, never-ending tunnel 
of black. There was nothing. Nothing at all but lonely, lonely 
darkness.

A dark, deep, cruel voice laughed at her as she fell.

&#145;You will never be with her again! Never! You threw away your chance 
and now, you will know nothing but despair!&#146;

Chikane lashed out desperately. &quot;No! I will! I will! Himeko! HIMEKO!!&quot;

&quot;Shh... Shhhh...&quot;

And suddenly, Himeko was there. In the horror and the confusion and the 
dark, dark nothingness, she could feel her beloved holding her 
sweating, pitiful body. Himeko&#39;s scent filled her nose, powerful and
sweet, smelling of summer and sunlight. Chikane could feel her lover&#39;s 
hands gently stroking her hair.

Chikane tried to swallow, throat dry. &quot;H-Himeko?&quot;

Her beloved continued to make soft, soothing noises.

Chikane choked back a sob. Oh gods, how pitiful she was. How could she 
ever have contemplating going on without her beloved? There was no life 
without Himeko! She buried her head into Himeko&#39;s ample bosom, wrapping 
her arms tightly around the other woman, inhaling her beloved&#39;s 
familiar,
signature perfume. 

She could never let Himeko go. No. Never. 

With trembling hands, she reached up, felt the side of Himeko&#39;s face 
and 
pulled her lover down into a deep, demanding kiss. The intensity of her 
need surprised the other woman - it was surprising even to Chikane 
herself. 

Himeko resisted, jerking backwards, but when Chikane refused to let her 
go, she began to melt into the kiss, responding back.

With trembling fingers, Chikane pulled open Himeko&#146;s pajamas, causing 
stubborn buttons to pop. Her mouth and hands roamed over a body made 
almost unfamiliar by the trauma of her dreams. 

She heard Himeko gasp, voice raspy and almost unrecognizable with 
throaty arousal. &quot;W-wait! Chi-Chikannngh...!&quot;

But Chikane could not wait. She silenced her lover with another kiss. 
She had to make Himeko hers. Hers and only hers.

AUTHOR&#39;S NOTES &amp; OMAKE

I&#39;m not sure why this idea wouldn&#39;t leave me alone. Maybe it&#39;s because 
Chikane-chan&#39;s uber competence, while amazingly cool and sexy, was just 
begging to be toyed with. =P 

Anyway, for those of you expecting more lemony material, my apologies 
(but honestly, do ya really want to read about Chikane + anyone besides 
Himeko?!). There exists an opportunity for more explicit disclosure in 
the next chapter, and the chapter after that (this fic is planned to 
be three chapters long), but I probably won&#146;t take that opportunity,
in order to keep this fic to a Lime rating, rather than a full blown
Lemon. Those scenes will probably be released as a separate 0.5 
chapter, once the main story is told. Because muse-chan is sort of
begging to write them now. &gt;_&lt; 

Many thanks to those of you who read Finally Healing! Your kind words 
are a big reason why this fic was born. And a big thank you to Eimii. 
I only hope to be able to have 1/34th of your mad English and 
yarn-spinning skillz at some point in time.

Thanks for reading! 

And here are omake, because this fic, and KnM in general, have a lot of 
omake worthy moments...

OMAKE I - Someone&#39;s in a Good Mood...

&lt;It is the morning after, and Chikane and Himeko are sitting at the 
dinner table waiting for breakfast. Whaddaya mean it doesn&#146;t make 
sense and Himeko&#146;s left for Mako-chan&#146;s wedding? Just ignore that for
now. Chikane keeps trying to hide behind a massive newspaper&gt;

OTOHA: &lt;rolls in on the morning breakfast dolly like a kid on a 
shopping cart&gt; Goooood Morning! Isn&#39;t it a beeeeeaaaauuuuutiful day?!

CHIKANE: &lt;sweatdropping massively. Murmurs&gt; Ohayo...

HIMEKO: &lt;Surprised&gt; Otoha-san... you&#39;re positively glowing!

OTOHA: &lt;Puts a hand up to her cheek coyly&gt; Aaaaaaaam I??

HIMEKO: &lt;Slightly frightened smile&gt; Y-yes? What&#39;s put you in such a 
good mood?

OTOHA: Ohohohoho! That, Kurusugawa-sama, is a secret! &lt;Turns to grab 
food to put on table&gt;

HIMEKO: &lt;sweatdropping&gt; Eheh... &lt;whispers to CHIKANE&gt; I think someone 
got laid last night...

CHIKANE: &lt;rips the paper in two with nervous energy&gt; Itwasn&#39;tmeiswear!!

OMAKE II - Why They were in the Dark Room in the First Place...

HIMEKO: Chikane-chan... are you sure we should be doing this...? 
&lt;putting print into developer with tongs&gt;

CHIKANE: Well... would you rather we got these done by some teenager at 
Walmart? 

HIMEKO: &lt;wrinkles her nose&gt; No... but... &lt;pauses&gt; Saay, you&#39;re 
fabulously rich! Why haven&#39;t you given me a digital camera yet? 

CHIKANE: Uh... &lt;sweatdrops&gt;

HIMEKO: &lt;Distracted&gt; Oh! It&#39;s coming! It&#39;s...! &lt;Looks at picture&gt; 
&lt;blushes profusely&gt; ... 

CHIKANE:  ... wow. &lt;grins stupidly at HIMEKO&gt; See, I told you the 
handcuffs would be more dramatic than the whip!

HIMEKO: &lt;continues to blush profusely&gt; ... 

CHIKANE: Hmm..., I shouldn&#39;t have zoomed in so much. I cut off your 
stilettos. Rats. And they were so cute on you too...</pre>
