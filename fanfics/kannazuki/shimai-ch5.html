<p>&quot;No,&quot;  the woman instantly corrected herself, &quot;no, you're not the Solar  Priestess. I can sense nothing but common humanity from you.&quot; She unwound herself from the chair, her blue jean-clad legs moving  with an effortless, athletic grace. The arms revealed by her  short-sleeved T-shirt were marked by crisscrossing thin white lines,  scars that almost seemed delicate. &quot;Another mistake by the  First Neck, it seems. She was so sure that you would be the one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Orochi!&quot;  Himeko gasped.</p>
<p>A  darkness glittered in the woman's sky-blue eyes, like chips of black  sapphire.</p>
<p>&quot;So  your sister talks to you. That's good. Families should be close. And...&quot; She reached into her jeans pocket and took out a short  cylinder of carved ivory capped with brass. A flick of her thumb  revealed that it was a switchblade knife, the five-inch blade that  sprang from the end polished to a high gloss. &quot;...and least  this way my trip wasn't wasted.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  stared at the knife, trembling. Her heart pounded like a  trip-hammer, and she seemed frozen like a bird caught in a snake's  gaze. She'd spoken bravely the day before about facing danger, about  not wanting anyone else to be hurt in her place, but idealistic  dreams didn't protect her from fear when she was face-to-face with an  Orochi who knew who she was, who wanted her life.</p>
<p>&quot;Hikari, <em>run!</em>&quot;  Marika cried, pulling on her arm. The petite girl yanked her hard  enough that her foot slipped, and while she caught her balance, the  spell broke. The fear was no longer a cold paralysis but a hot spear  digging into her, screaming <em>runfleeescape</em>.</p>
<p>A  dark aura seemed to envelop the Orochi, as if she was wrapped in a  veil of black flames.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,  do run,&quot; she said. &quot;Let me have some fun with this.&quot;</p>
<p>The  girls bolted, pounding down the corridor and crashing through the  door to the stairs. <em>If  only I could do something!</em> Himeko  thought. She couldn't think of anything, though; all she could do  was run and even that not all that well.</p>
<p>There  was a growl behind them as they made the turn at the final landing  before the ground floor, and Himeko could not resist turning her head  to see. A great, dark shape hurtled down the stairs they'd just  descended and crashed into the wall, blasting gouges out of the  plaster and sending cracks radiating out in all directions. Himeko  let out a little yelp and the shape turned towards her.</p>
<p>It  looked like a giant panther, she realized, only every part of it but  the eyes--skin, fur, tongue, claws, teeth, everything--seemed to be  made from inky darkness, as if shadows had been given tangible form  and pooled together in a coherent mass. Its eyes were blank ovals of  glimmering violet, and wisps as if of amethyst flame seemed to  flicker off its body into the air.</p>
<p>Marika  screamed while little whimpering noises came involuntarily from deep  in Himeko's throat. She didn't know if that made her less or more  scared than her friend.</p>
<p>&quot;C-come  on!&quot; she babbled, plucking at Marika's sleeve while fighting to  tear her eyes away from the monster. Was this what Chikane had meant  by the Shadow of an Orochi god? <em>What  can I do to fight </em>that<em>?</em></p>
<p>The  panther flexed its claws, the casual movement of its paw tearing  gouges into the tile. The movement spurred the girls; they scampered  down the stairs and out through the door.</p>
<p>That  was when Himeko realized that there <em>was</em> something  she could do to fight the Orochi, or at least to help thwart it. She  turned and shoved Marika as hard as she could with both hands. The  tiny girl fell stumbling away to land on the grassy verge beyond the  walk.</p>
<p>&quot;Hikari,  what are you--&quot; Marika cried, but Himeko had already turned to  run the other way, back towards the path along which they'd  approached the dorm. In the next instant, a black pool seemed to  ooze out from beneath the closed door, then rose up into the shape of  the giant cat and loped after Himeko.</p>
<p><em>Yes!  At least Marika is safe!</em> the  blonde exulted momentarily, before her own situation drove out that  happiness. She glanced over her shoulder at the shadowy cat and her  stomach flip-flopped. <em>Chikane,  what am I supposed to do?</em></p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>Marika  pounded her fist on the grass. <em>Damn  it, damn it, damn it, Hikari, why did you </em>do<em> that?</em> But she knew why, well enough. Hikari was that kind of person. If  the two girls were together, then that woman was as likely as not to  destroy Marika just for being there, but if they separated there was  no question which one she'd follow.</p>
<p><em>I  can't just lay here</em>,  Marika thought. <em>I  have to do something.</em> Her legs were trembling so badly she could barely move them, though.  The woman--the Orochi--had been unlike anything she'd imagined. She  was certain that they weren't alive now because of anything they'd  done, because of running or dodging, but because the Orochi liked to  play with her prey instead of killing it outright. She was the  daughter of the Ohgami Shrine priest, and she could still scarcely  believe in the reality of it.</p>
<p><em>Hikari  and Tsukuyo </em>fought <em>those  things? Not once, but over and over through multiple lifetimes? </em>she  marveled.  Marika couldn't imagine it; she'd go mad in their place. And Hikari?  Gentle, sunny Hikari as a shrine maiden of the God of  Swords? The idea was almost inconceivable for her.</p>
<p>It  did, though, make her realize what she could do. If there was anyone  who she could imagine fighting that thing it was Tsukuyo. The Lunar  Priestess would move heaven and earth to protect Hikari. Marika had  to find her.</p>
<p><em>Hikari  said that...she had a late world history class,</em> she  remembered. <em>That  would have been in the history/lit building, but because of  yesterday's damage...</em>It  came to her a moment later; history was temporarily sharing  facilities with engineering. She quickly calculated the most likely  route for Tsukuyo to follow, and started to get to her feet. The act  of deciding to do something had, if not eased her fear, at least  calmed her enough to regain some self-control, and though she was a  little wobbly at first she began to regain her equilibrium as she  started to jog, then run, hoping to meet Tsukuyo halfway.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>More  than one head turned as Chikane strolled back to the dorm, just as  they had during class. It had been over six months since she'd last  worn her only pair of blue jeans, and that had been because she'd  accompanied Himeko on a photography hike. She couldn't remember the  last time she hadn't worn a skirt when not required to by  circumstance.</p>
<p>Then  again, to her mind, this <em>was</em> 'required  by circumstance.' If an Orochi appeared, she wanted the mobility  offered by pants. It was the same reason her <em>tanto</em> dagger  was in her bag. She'd even gone so far as to pick up her bow before  her late lecture; it was slung over her back in its case and was the  cause of at least as many stares as the jeans. She'd fobbed off her  professor's questions with some excuse about late practice, but she  still felt the eyes, the stares, the questioning glances. It  narrowed the distance she carefully maintained between herself and  the rest of the world.</p>
<p>It  was Himeko who'd done this, Himeko whose presence demanded that the  real Chikane come to the forefront. It reminded her of how just two  days ago she'd wished that she could openly be a couple with her  lover, actually stood there and <em>yearned</em> for the chance to openly expose her innermost self to strangers. Himeko  was her sun, her light that scattered all her lies, her fears,  her self-doubts, Himeko's relentless--there was no other word for  it--love for the true Chikane giving her the strength to let that  Chikane out, bit by bit.</p>
<p>She  still preferred their time together within the Lunar Shrine. Just  herself and Himeko, with no one else to share herself with.</p>
<p>&quot;Tsukuyo!&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane's  gaze flicked ahead towards the voice. It was Marika, whom she  simultaneously hated for every minute the girl occupied Himeko's time  and cherished for being a trusted friend that helped make Himeko  happy. They'd had relatively few interactions themselves on a  personal level.</p>
<p>Marika  was running, almost panting for breath, though, and her face, Chikane  saw, was wreathed in pure panic.</p>
<p>&quot;What's  wrong?&quot; she asked at once. &quot;Is Himeko all right?&quot;</p>
<p>Marika  bent over, gasping for breath, her hands on her knees to support  herself.</p>
<p>&quot;It's  an Orochi,&quot; she wheezed out. &quot;She chased Hikari...from the  dorm down...the hill path.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  was in motion at once, leaving the path and cutting across the campus  grounds at a dead run. She didn't understand why the Orochi would be  after Himeko, unless Reiko just wanted to hurt Chikane, to make her  suffer in a way that nothing else would, but if the Orochi had been  Reiko, Marika would have said so.</p>
<p>A  different Neck, then, one with no personal stake in the outcome. <em>So  why go after Himeko?</em></p>
<p>Ruthlessly,  she shoved the questions aside. They didn't matter now, anyway. All  that mattered was getting to Himeko as soon as possible, and the  desperate hope that the Orochi needed her victim alive for some  reason.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>Himeko  squealed in pain as the paw struck her side and sent her flying, then  grunted as she crashed into the bank. The shadow panther did not  follow up its attack, though, but crouched ready to spring as the  blue-haired woman came up next to it. She stroked its head gently,  affectionately as she looked at Himeko.</p>
<p>&quot;I  really  wish that I didn't have to do this,&quot; she said  conversationally. No, that wasn't right, thought Himeko; there  seemed to be genuine regret in the voice. &quot;I'd rather not hurt  another woman. We suffer too much in this damned world as it is. But  your sister is the Lunar Priestess, and we can't pass up this  opportunity. Only with the death of the priestesses can we be  assured of Orochi's final triumph.&quot;</p>
<p>Whimpering,  Himeko inched backwards up the bank, her feet digging into the grassy  soil, loose rocks and gravel scratching against her back. She knew  she needed to do something, but she was too scared to think.</p>
<p>&quot;The  First Neck says that your sister cares for you more than anyone, so  even if you didn't turn out to be the Solar Priestess, with you in  our hands we'll still have a lever to use against her.&quot;</p>
<p><em>So  that's why I'm still alive</em>,  Himeko thought. She'd been batted around and scratched up a bit like  a terrified mouse, but the Orochi had clearly been holding back. Now  she understood. She couldn't let the Orochi hurt Chikane through  her, but she couldn't think of anything she could do to stop the  woman.</p>
<p>The  Orochi urged the great cat forward; it padded towards Himeko with  slow, relentless steps.</p>
<p>Suddenly,  three arrows zipped down and buried themselves in the cat's side, the  points of impact each shining with a pale, almost silvery light that  dispelled the shadow's cohesion. The panther became more and more  translucent, until Himeko could see the glowing arrowheads through  it, then faded even further to become little more than a pale gray  smudge, until it was gone entirely and the arrows clattered to the  ground.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane!&quot;  Himeko cried jubilantly.</p>
<p>The  Lunar Priestess snapped off another shot at the Orochi herself, but  the blue-haired woman sidestepped, then hurled her knife up the bank  towards Chikane. Chikane dove aside, a good move as it turned out as  an explosion of black fire burst from the ground where the knife  struck. The Orochi produced another blade while Chikane skidded down  the bank to the path, putting herself between the Orochi and Himeko. Chikane dropped her bow and drew her <em>tanto.</em> The two women made an eerie mirror to one another, the grim fury in  both faces making Himeko shiver.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>It  had  been an unrewarding day, Takeshi Ohgami thought as he slowly read  down yet another scroll. The shrine records were very specific as to  rituals, but all too often retreated into the generalizations of  legend when dealing with the nature of the Orochi and their battles  with the priestesses. His past conversations with the Asamiya  sisters had given him a good idea as to why: every time the battle  was won, the world itself was remade, time unwound so that from the  perspective of those who lived on the battle had never occurred.  History could not record that which humans had not experienced; the  memories of the gods were given voice only in myth. Even the  priestesses themselves did not customarily retain the knowledge of  their part, requiring the existence of the Ohgami family.</p>
<p>Tsukuyo  had indicated, obliquely, that it had been largely Hikari's doing  that the present circumstances were so different from the cycles in  the legend. Was this the reason why she was not, apparently, the  Solar Priestess? Had she stepped out of her own role in the course  of, again apparently, saving Tsukuyo from the despair that had made  her Orochi?</p>
<p>If  the shrine's archive contained answers to those questions, they were  stubbornly refusing to reveal themselves. Neither he nor his sister  had been able to discover anything beyond what they'd already known.</p>
<p>Yet  perhaps that was the problem, he thought. What he'd been taught by  his father had been that the coming of the Orochi, the battle of the  priestesses, and the triumph of Ame no Murakumo were all part of an  eternal cycle compelled by destiny. This promoted rigid, patterned  thinking. Perhaps his problem was not a lack of knowledge but an  inability to accurately interpret the knowledge he had. &quot;Eternal&quot;  and &quot;destined&quot; did not, after all, mean &quot;immutable,&quot;  as had been proved.</p>
<p>It  was in this spirit that he renewed his research, and when he happened  to read (or more accurately reread, as it was the fourth time he'd  come across some variation of it that day) a particular passage, it  sparked his imagination.</p>
<p>&quot;Minako.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;  she said sharply. Ever since she was a little girl she'd always  hated being distracted while she was reading.</p>
<p>&quot;I  think I've found something. Listen to this.&quot;</p>
<p>He  read it out to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,  and...?&quot;</p>
<p>Takeshi  explained, then, what his conclusions were and a smile slowly spread  across her face.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,  now,&quot; Minako mused. &quot;Isn't that an interesting  development?&quot;</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>The  knife blades rang off of one another as Chikane and the Orochi  lunged. The switchblade and tanto were more than just steel; they  were extensions of their power as Sixth Neck and Lunar Priestess and  the silver and violet sparks they struck off one another were only  the slightest hint of the forces meeting.</p>
<p>This  Orochi, Chikane realized, wasn't like Reiko, dangerous only because  her sword was a manifestation of Take no Sukunazuchi. This one knew  how to fight. She was good at it, entirely apart from her  supernatural force. Indeed, it was only her own enhanced abilities  she was using; it was the panther-construct Chikane had recognized as  the Shadow of Izuhara no Tamazuchi. Chikane was lucky that she'd had  the chance to attack and dispel it without warning, given how evenly  matched they now seemed to be.</p>
<p>The  woman, she could tell, was doing the same thing she was, taking her  opponent's measure during the initial clashes between them, measuring  not only skill but determination and resolve during these exchanges  of cut and parry. Of course, determination was inherent in an  Orochi's nature; they wouldn't be Orochi if there wasn't something  powerful driving them, a core of pain and rage and despair regardless  of how lighthearted or even comical their personalities might have  seemed on the outside.</p>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot;  the Orochi asked as Chikane's tanto sliced a cut in the fabric of her  T-shirt while missing the flesh beneath. &quot;Why are you doing  this?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  struck aside the two quick ripostes. The heat in her back was like a  brand eating into her skin; she was pushing the limits of her  mostly-sealed power in keeping up with the Orochi.</p>
<p>&quot;Why  are you fighting us? I can feel it from you. The same anger as in  us, the same disgust with the world.&quot;</p>
<p><em>She's  not taunting,</em> Chikane  realized. <em>She  genuinely wants to know.</em></p>
<p>Chikane  lashed out again, driving her back.</p>
<p>&quot;I  could ask you the same thing,&quot; she said. She certainly wasn't  about to have a heart-to-heart about her feelings for Himeko in the  middle of a knife fight! &quot;Even when I let my anger reign, I  tried to fix what was wrong with my own hands, not tried to just  destroy everything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do  you think I didn't try?&quot; the woman shouted. &quot;I looked and  I looked for that bastard, but his family had transferred away while  I was in the hospital and I never found them! I found others, though,  so many like him. Boys who think paying for a date means a right to  a girl's body. Men who believe their desire gives them the right to  do whatever they want.&quot; She slashed at Chikane wildly, her  strokes carrying greater force, channeling more of the darkness but  ironically easier to evade. &quot;So I studied. I planned. I  watched. I trained. At first, I thought that I was doing some good, <em>helping</em> in my small way. But it never ends! There are always more of them,  more filth like a festering plague, bubbling up out of this corrupt  world's heart!&quot;</p>
<p>As  she spoke, it began to dawn on Chikane what the Orochi was talking  about, how--and why--she'd gained her skill, her causal ease with a  blade, and as it did the hilt of the tanto almost seemed to crawl  beneath the Lunar Priestess's fingers. She'd owned another such  weapon once, when she was Chikane Himemiya. As had suited the  heiress of Mahoroba's founding clan, it had been a masterwork blade,  even its hilt and sheath a work of art in fantastically colored  patterns inlaid in the wood. She remembered the feel of that hilt  under her rapidly numbing fingers, how she'd flung it away, unable to  bear touching it because of the blood she'd shed not with the blade  but with the sheath.</p>
<p>Himeko's  blood.</p>
<p>She  stared at the enraged face of the Orochi, watched as a crackling aura  of shadows began to swell up around the woman, and the only coherent  thought in Chikane's mind was a paraphrase of a Western quotation  she'd once read.</p>
<p><em>There,  but for the grace of God, go thee</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko...&quot;  passed from her lips, the dagger dropped from her hand, and it was  actually fortunate that she sagged to her knees on the path because  if she hadn't the Orochi's knife would have torn out her throat,  instead of passing over her head.</p>
<p>The  Orochi stared at her in confusion. Whatever she'd expected, it  certainly wasn't this. Her confusion, however, was a momentarily,  fleeting thing, and the dark aura swelled up, the translucent image  of the panther beginning to reform as she called upon Izuhara no  Tamazuchi to destroy the Lunar Priestess.</p>
<p>Then  her body jerked as a rock struck her head.</p>
<p>It  wasn't a very big rock--five pounds at most--and it hadn't been  thrown very hard because Himeko wasn't particularly athletic. The  fact that she'd actually hit her target with a kind of two-handed  shot put from halfway up the slope was amazing in and of itself. The  impact of the crude, purely mortal weapon on the Orochi was  negligible, no more bothersome than a friend's playful cuff upside  the head. But it got her attention: she whirled, arm spinning to  hurl her knife at the gnat that dared to interfere.</p>
<p>The  sight of Himeko in danger was probably the only thing that could have  commanded an instant, instinctive response from Chikane at that  point, but it did. She scooped up her tanto and rammed it into the  Orochi's exposed side. The throw never happened; the woman staggered  back in pain and shock and in the next instant she was gone, black  fire seeming to consume her.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane!&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko's  running feet on the grass.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane,  what's wrong? Are you hurt?&quot; She dropped to her own knees next  to Chikane, her eyes pleading and worried. In the next instant  Chikane had flung herself against Himeko, fisting her hands in  Himeko's shirt as she buried her face against her sister's shoulder  and wept, choking on the sorrow that threatened to consume her.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane?&quot;  Himeko asked, though <em>babbled</em> was  more like it. She didn't understand what had happened. One minute  Chikane had been fighting the Orochi, and in the next had  just...dropped, but without a blow being struck or any other kind of  injury she could see. And now this, her beloved crying as if her  soul had been torn out of her. &quot;What did she do to you? How can  I help? Chikane, tell me!&quot; she pleaded. Her arms had closed  around Chikane almost reflexively, but she was afraid to hold her  tightly for fear there was some injury.</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko!  I'm sorry, Himeko. I'm so, so sorry!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;C-Chikane?&quot; <em>Sorry?</em> Himeko thought helplessly. <em>Sorry  about what?</em> The  only thing she could think of were the injuries the Orochi woman had  inflicted. &quot;I'm okay, really. I just got knocked around a bit. I've had  worse just falling down, honest! You got here and saved me  before anything really bad could happen, so...so it's okay, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  shook her head, still sobbing.</p>
<p>&quot;No,  n-not that,&quot; she wept. &quot;What <em>I</em> did. I didn't...I didn't even stop to think! Gods, I was so <em>stupid</em>!&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  blinked helplessly.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane,  I don't understand,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;What's happened?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The  Orochi. What she was saying...&quot; She stopped, taking several  deep, ragged breaths as if she was trying to inhale through her  tears. &quot;Oh, Himeko, <em>what  if I'd done that to you?</em>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If  you'd done what?&quot; It was so frustrating, not knowing what it was  that Chikane meant.</p>
<p>&quot;When  I--when I hurt you--&quot; She sniffed, then shook her head. &quot;No,  let me say it. When I <em>raped</em> you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane,  that was in our <em>past  lives</em>!&quot;  Himeko protested. &quot;You know that's over and done with.&quot; <em>Why  on earth was she bringing it up now?</em></p>
<p>&quot;I  wanted you to hate me. I wanted you to think I was a monster so that  you'd be willing to kill me. So I did the worst thing to you that I  could imagine, but I...I just assumed how you'd react to it.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Oh.</em></p>
<p>&quot;I  never stopped to think, never realized what that kind of horror could  do to you. What if you'd become like...like that woman? Or what if  it had broken you? There are so many different ways people could  react, and--&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  cut off her protests the only way she could think of, by grabbing  Chikane's arms and kissing her. It wasn't a gentle kiss, either, but  warm and deep, the kind that sent tingles of fire through Himeko's  own body. Chikane struggled against it for a second, but Himeko was  insistent, nipping at her lover's lower lip, then probing with the  tip of her tongue until Chikane's mouth flowered open beneath her  own. Only when she felt the tension leave Chikane's body, her  beloved relax into her arms, did she end the kiss.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane,  you  and I have been together for hundreds of years,&quot; Himeko  said, &quot;years that we don't even remember but that we feel in the  depth of our hearts. If you didn't stop to think of what might have  gone wrong, it's not because you were careless but because of how  well you know me. Even though you didn't know how much I love  you...and how could you, since I was so slow to understand it myself  and caused you so much pain...even though you didn't know, you still  understood in your heart that I would be all right. That's all. What  another person might have felt or suffered in that place didn't  matter, because you know <em>me</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So...please,  Chikane? You were so horribly, horribly lost back then. I don't ever  want to see you feeling any guilt or pain about anything you did to  me or felt about me. All I want in life is to be your one and only  Himeko. And even if I'm...I'm not the world's sun any more, please  let me shine for you?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  buried her face against Himeko's shoulder again with a fresh wail. <em>Oh,  no, I've messed it up again! What did I say?</em></p>
<p>&quot;I  don't deserve you, Himeko!&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  sighed with relief and let her arms close around Chikane again,  holding her close.</p>
<p>&quot;I  feel the same way about you, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>Tears  of relief always ended faster than tears of sorrow, and in a couple  of minutes Himeko was kissing the wetness away from beneath Chikane's  eyes. They suddenly jerked back from each other, though, at the  sound of a loudly cleared throat.</p>
<p>&quot;Er...am  I interrupting a moment?&quot;</p>
<p>They  spun towards Marika, who for only the second time since Himeko had  met her, was blushing.</p>
<p>&quot;So...um...I  guess you got here in time?&quot;</p>
<p>The  glare that Chikane had been starting to level at her for the  interruption suddenly softened, then she smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,  thanks to you coming and finding me.&quot; She rose, helping Himeko  to her feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,  then...yay for me?&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  giggled, then hooked her arm through Chikane's as they went to find  her bow. Maybe it was just for now, but at least in this moment  everything was all right again.</p>
