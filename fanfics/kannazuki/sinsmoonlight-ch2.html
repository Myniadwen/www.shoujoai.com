<h1>Sins in the Moonlight (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kannazuki/index.html">Kannazuki no Miko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dezopengiun.html">DezoPenguin</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kannazuki/sinsmoonlight-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><P>The tall, well-dressed Japanese man put away the phone and permitted himself a fleeting 
smile of self-satisfaction.</P><P>It was done. They had her.</P><P>Now the waiting game 
began. The Himemiya family would need to step forward, offering money. They would do it, 
sooner or later. There would be hesitation, pride, unwillingness to show weakness in the 
face of criminals, but this was their sole child. They would pay.</P><P>The money would 
disappear.</P><P>The kidnappers would disappear as well. Tamura and his yakuza friends 
would see to that. The man in the sharkskin suit had a close working relationship with the 
Ayanokouji-<I>gumi</I> in the Islands, a relationship made all the more valuable because 
the Himemiya Financial Group's contacts in Japan were largely with the 
Takamura-<I>gumi</I>, a rival clan. There was, therefore, considerably less chance of loose 
lips somewhere down the line, simply because there were fewer people in a position to 
listen.</P><P>Tamura and his <I>oyabun</I> would get their sizable cut.</P><P>And the man 
in the sharkskin suit would be set for life. One billion yen was, he thought, a nice round 
number for his share.</P><P>All he had to do was wait.</P><p style="text-align:center;">~X 
X X~</P><P>"It doesn't m-make any sense!" Himeko stammered. "What would anyone want with 
Chikane-chan?" She clutched at her twin's dropped purse like it was some kind of talisman, 
while she fought to get her reeling emotions under control.</P><P>"Yeah, it's not like your 
family has any money," Marika said. "I mean, if it were Himemiya-san, it 
would..."</P><P>Her voice trailed off.</P><P>"Marika-chan?"</P><P>Himeko turned to see what 
had caused her friend to fall silent. Marika was looking off to her left, back into the 
International Market. Himeko followed her gaze and saw the fallen Gin getting woozily back 
to his feet.</P><P>"They knocked out Gin-san before kidnapping Miya-sama," Reiko put it 
into words. "They t-thought that Miya-sama was me. I...I mean, why shouldn't they? She's 
beautiful and stylish and confident, poised and talented...anyone would think she was the 
heiress, not me."</P><P>Himeko could hear the bitterness in her voice, and the guilt that 
underlay it. <I>If only I was more like her. If only I was worthy of the Himemiya name, 
they'd never have taken Miya-sama.</I> She recognized it in Reiko because that guilt was an 
old friend of hers, the gnawing fear that she wasn't good enough for Chikane or to be the 
Solar Priestess. She'd all but been crippled by the fear in her past life, until the depth 
of her love for Chikane had led her to find the inner core of strength she hadn't realized 
she possessed.</P><P>Now Chikane was in danger. She needed to find that strength again. 
Scared as she was, helpless as she felt in the face of the sudden violence, Himeko knew she 
had to get control of herself. She didn't know what she <I>could</I> do, she felt so 
powerless, but she had to be ready for something, for any opportunity. She wasn't any good 
to Chikane if she stood around crying, making people waste time on her.</P><P>"Please, get 
a hold of yourself, Himemiya-san," Himeko said, lightly touching the girl on the shoulder. 
"We should see if Gin-san is all right."</P><P>"O-okay." She looked grateful just to have 
some kind of direction.</P><P>"We should call the police," Marika suggested.</P><P>"Yeah, 
but...my English is really bad," Himeko said. "I don't think they could understand 
me."</P><P>"Me, either. Himemiya-san?"</P><P>Reiko shook her head.</P><P>"Not very well. My 
family's tutors taught me German, and a smattering of Mandarin Chinese, but I don't know 
much English." She sighed. "Oh, but Gin-san knows. That's why Otousama picked him for this 
trip. So does Haseo-san, the other bodyguard; he's from the branch here in 
Honolulu."</P><P>"Okay," Himeko decided. "If Gin-san is able, he can call the police; if 
not, then you can call the hotel and get Haseo-san to do it." She started walking toward 
the fallen bodyguard.</P><P>"Miya-chan, I'm so sorry; if I hadn't been here...this is all 
my fault!"</P><P>Himeko shook her head.</P><P>"There's no time to feel bad for ourselves," 
she said resolutely. "We have to do whatever we can to help Chikane-chan."</P><P>Despite 
her brave words, though, she could not suppress a shiver of fear at the thought of what 
Chikane was going through.</P><p style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P>"Come on, come 
on, rise and shine, Miss Himemiya."</P><P>Consciousness returned dully to Chikane, like she 
was waking out of a deep sleep. Her head pounded like a triphammer, clouding her thoughts 
even more. Something seemed wrong, out of place. <I>Himemiya...no, it's Asamiya now, isn't 
it?</I></P><P>She struggled to open her eyes, but couldn't quite make it.</P><P>"Up and at 
'em, girl; we haven't got all day."</P><P><I>English? Why are they speaking English?</I> 
Something wasn't right. She fought for memory, to try and recall <I>why</I> there was this 
mounting sensation of wrongness but couldn't quite grasp it, like trying to catch a 
raindrop only to have it run through her fingers.</P><P>"You think she's still 
out?"</P><P>"Nah. Her breathing's changed. She's coming around."</P><P>Chikane felt the 
whisper of cloth against her face and light stabbed painfully into her eyelids. She tried 
to groan but her lips didn't move—no, <I>couldn't</I> move, were held shut by something. 
Tape! Memory crashed in on her—the sudden attack, the men, the spasms of the Taser, the van 
pulling alongside, the prick of a needle.</P><P>Kidnapping.</P><P>She tried opening her 
eyes again, to focus and learn what she could about her surroundings. The light was a 
bright beam of sunlight shining through and concentrated by a skylight in the roof thirty 
feet above her. The building was some kind of warehouse or farm storage shed, with a packed 
dirt floor and corrugated metal walls. She herself was tied to a straight-backed chair, 
arms behind her and ankles tied to the chair legs. The cord prickled at her wrists; she 
thought it was probably plain hemp rope.</P><P>The skylight, the few high windows, and 
several hooded bulbs descending on wires from the ceiling gave decent illumination, and 
Chikane could see four men facing her: a slim Japanese in a black T-shirt and cargo pants, 
silver rings in his left ear and nostril; a burly man of mixed Pacific Islands ethnicities 
in which no one origin seemed dominant, showing off tattooed arms in a tank top and Bermuda 
shorts; a stubble-cheeked blond with surfer-boy looks in a red Hawaiian shirt and white 
pants; and a tall, broad-shouldered, narrow-hipped man with the features of a native 
Hawaiian whose tight-fitting T-shirt and jeans showed off lean, hard muscles, the kind a 
man got through swimming, running, or martial arts instead of pumping iron. She remembered 
the tattooed man and the surfer from when she'd been grabbed; the surfer had had the 
Taser.</P><P>Surfer Boy chuckled.</P><P>"Hell, if looks could kill, we'd be bleeding out 
now. Must not have liked our invitation."</P><P>Chikane's gaze lingered on the tattooed man 
for a moment. His color deepened, and he stepped forward and ripped the duct tape off her 
mouth. It stung like blazes, but she choked down the reflexive yelp. She wasn't going to 
give him the satisfaction of a response.</P><P>The Hawaiian grinned. "Looks like you pissed 
off Rex with your little stunt, Miss Himemiya. Then again, I suppose it's only sensible 
that one of Japan's richest heiresses knows a little self-defense."</P><P>"I'm not—" 
Chikane began, then snapped her mouth shut. <I>What am I thinking? I almost told them that 
I'm not Reiko!</I> That would be a fatal mistake. Himemiya Reiko was a valuable asset who 
could bring these men wealth. Asamiya Tsukuyo was worthless dead weight—worse, she was a 
substantial liability, a witness. If they learned whom she was, or more accurately wasn't, 
they'd kill her at once.</P><P>"You can go ahead and scream, you know," the surfer told 
her. "There's nobody out here that can hear you, anyway. And it'd make Rex happy. You owe 
him one for the fall you gave him."</P><P><I>He owes me one</I>, she thought. <I>If I'd 
known he was a kidnapper instead of a purse-snatcher I'd have crippled him instead of just 
knocking him down.</I> Not that it would have saved her from the Taser, but it would have 
meant one less captor and possibly a valuable witness left behind in police 
custody.</P><P>She cut off that chain of thought. "What ifs" were useless, and chewing over 
past mistakes wasn't going to help. She had to get away somehow, to get back to Himeko. 
<I>She must be frantic.</I></P><P>"I'm not telling you anything."</P><P>The men laughed. 
The Hawaiian's, though, was the shortest, and he stepped forward, grabbing a fistful of 
Chikane's hair and jerking her head back.</P><P>"Now, listen up, bitch. You may think 
you're hot shit, with all your daddy's money and your school-team martial arts tricks, but 
none of that means jack to me. I could cut your throat right here and now and only care 
about getting the bloodstains off my boots. You get that?"</P><P>Chikane didn't say 
anything. He yanked her head back farther, sending a shock of pain through her scalp. His 
free hand dipped into his hip pocket and brought out a butterfly knife, which he spun open 
with a practiced movement. The Islander pressed the point of the knife to the soft skin 
just behind Chikane's chin, and she felt the sting as he dug the tip in, just a 
little.</P><P>"I said, you get that?"</P><P>"She gets it," the Japanese man said. "Her 
English is perfect. She did all the translating for the girls when they were shopping. Very 
good English and very fancy, high-class Japanese."</P><P><I>He was spying on me?</I> But of 
course, someone had had to be watching; how else would they have been tricked into thinking 
"Miya-sama" was Himemiya Reiko. Indeed, it was Reiko herself who called her "Miya-sama" in 
their group of four, so ironically it was their intended victim who'd inadvertently 
redirected their attention to Chikane, over and above language and mannerisms. <I>I can't 
believe I didn't notice I was being followed, though.</I> Ordinary school life with Himeko 
had dulled the Lunar Priestess's warrior instincts.</P><P>Not that she'd trade that in. Her 
time with Himeko was too precious a treasure to miss any part of. But she needed to be more 
than that, now. It was the sword priestess, not the schoolgirl or the lover, whom she 
needed to be if she wanted to get out of this.</P><P>"You going to cooperate, girl? Or do I 
carve you up a bit? Rich family like yours, I'm sure they can give you enough surgery to 
make the scars mostly go away..." He took the knife away from her jaw and laid it just 
below her eye. "I'll start here, maybe," he said stroking the flat of the blade over her 
cheek down to the corner of her mouth. "Of course, I'll have to be careful. The muscles in 
that area are tricky and a careless slip could do permanent damage. Wouldn't want to wreck 
that gorgeous smile, hey?"</P><P>"What do you want?" Chikane asked, believing the man's 
threats. They weren't just for intimidation's sake, but had genuine menace behind them. He 
wouldn't want to kill her, not while she represented Himemiya family money to him, but he'd 
certainly hurt her. Probably, he'd enjoy it.</P><P>That was fair. She'd enjoy hurting him, 
too.</P><P>"Jojo?"</P><P>He put away the butterfly knife and extended a hand towards the 
Japanese man, who passed him a microcassette recorder, the kind businesspeople used in the 
'80s and '90s to dictate notes and memos into.</P><P>"We want you to sing for your daddy, 
little bird."</P><p style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P><I>"I'm alive and well, for 
now, and they say I'll remain that way if you...play by their rules. They assume the police 
have already been called by my friends or teachers and will accept that, but warn that any 
sign of surveillance or other...games...will result in my painful death. They'll contact 
you later with details of the payment and transfer, but suggest that the Himemiyas get 
several million dollars in old, non-sequential twenties and fifties prepared in the 
meantime.</I></P><P><I>"Tell Himeko that I'm all right and that I love 
her."</I></P><P>Detective-Lieutenant Lord clicked off the tape player.</P><P>"I'm not going 
to lie to you," he said to the assembled faces. "This is a grade-A fuck-up."</P><P>Next to 
him, Sergeant Morishita translated his words into Japanese, as the liaison officer had 
previously done for the kidnapped girl's. Under the circumstances, an interpreter was 
mandated; among the seven people facing the police in the hotel's conference room, only the 
Himemiya Financial Group representative, a lawyer named Machita, was truly bilingual. The 
two bodyguards and the teacher had the halting semi-fluency of someone who'd learned the 
language from books but rarely, if ever, practiced it among native speakers, while the 
three girls were even worse. It was doubly irritating to realize that judging by the voice 
on the tape and the waitresses' statements, the girl who'd been kidnapped was likely the 
one who'd have been most genuinely useful to have around.</P><P>He'd given some initial 
thought to the idea that this wasn't a mistake at all—that the girl might have been in on a 
staged kidnapping, all of the profit but none of the problems with controlling the hostage. 
He'd never have gotten to his rank if he'd accepted everything at face value. But the 
evidence and witness testimony had convinced Lord that this case was what it seemed like: a 
kidnapping where the criminals had grabbed the wrong target.</P><P>"I appreciate your 
sentiments, Lieutenant," the lawyer responded in English. "Nonetheless, I do not understand 
the reason for my presence. Miss Reiko is safe, and certainly neither I nor my clients have 
any information about these criminals."</P><P>"You're here because HPD is asking that the 
Himemiyas play along with the kidnappers. And given that this ransom tape wasn't even 
provided to us until <I>we</I> contacted <I>you</I>, I don't think you have much of a leg 
to stand on."</P><P>Machita did not flinch.</P><P>"For which I thank you. When this tape 
was delivered, I believed that Miss Himemiya had been, in fact, kidnapped. Now we know that 
this was not the case. We have no stake in this matter."</P><P><I>Smug bastard. He doesn't 
need me to tell him any of this</I>, Lord thought. But that was a lawyer, right enough, 
serving his clients' bottom line instead of doing the right thing.</P><P>"Because Miss 
Asamiya's safety may depend on it. The kidnappers believe they have Reiko Himemiya. If they 
find out the truth, they're likely to cut their losses, kill the girl and try to 
vanish."</P><P>The teacher flinched at this and after Morishita translated—no way was Lord 
letting the attorney keep this to himself—the strawberry blonde yelped. The girl who'd been 
identified as the real Reiko Himemiya spun to the lawyer and began spitting out rapid-fire 
Japanese.</P><P>"Please, Mr. Machita, you have to do what they say! Miya-sama was kidnapped 
because of me! I couldn't live with myself if we allowed anything to happen to her! You 
have to do everything in your power to see that she is brought home safely."</P><P>Machita 
showed nothing but a stoic face, but Lord knew that he was squirming inside. It hadn't been 
an accident, after all, that Lord made his request in front of the other involved parties. 
He couldn't expect the Himemiyas to actually pony up the ransom, but he wasn't going to let 
some shark in a suit say "Too bad; so sad" and let the girl get killed because she wasn't 
important to him.</P><P>Now, though, it was a matter of public face—and more, the heiress 
herself had made a request.</P><P>Machita inclined his head slightly.</P><P>"Very well, 
Lieutenant; please let me know how I may be of assistance to you."</P><p 
style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P>Surfer Boy dug the end of a bottle opener under 
the cap of a longneck and popped it open. He lifted the beer to his lips and took a deep 
drink, then sighed. Chikane appreciated the point; the bright sun and metal walls made the 
building hot, and the lack of ventilation made it stifling. Chikane's throat and tongue 
felt swollen, and perspiration dotted her face and limbs.</P><P>She'd have loved something 
cold and wet to drink, but she was actually glad of the heat. The heat was her friend, the 
perspiration making her skin slippery. She had been slowly, so it didn't show any more than 
it had to in her shoulders, working on the bonds, and believed she could get her wrists 
free in an instant at any time she liked. The ropes around her ankles, though, were a 
different problem; it would take time to untie them, time that she wouldn't have under the 
eyes of a guard.</P><P>The Hawaiian had left temporarily, no doubt to arrange delivery of 
the tape he'd had Chikane make. Hopefully he wouldn't discover that he had the wrong girl. 
He'd left the other three men on guard, but they hadn't wanted to sit around in the heat 
watching so they'd played rock-paper-scissors to determine who'd stay in and the 
surfer—Cedric, they'd called him—had been the loser.</P><P>The fact that they'd been so 
free with names and faces told Chikane something else, that even if the Himemiyas paid the 
ransom, they'd only be buying back a corpse. That meant she'd have to get away, not just 
before they learned the truth, but before their plan got to the point where they didn't 
need her alive.</P><P>The good news was, Cedric didn't have a gun. That wasn't so much out 
of concern for her life, though it was relevant, as for their own. There were three of 
them, bigger, stronger, and no doubt competent fighters. From where they stood, introducing 
guns into the equation would just make things worse. If she somehow got hold of one, it 
would maker her as big and strong as any of them.</P><P>In truth, Chikane would not want a 
gun except as a last resort. She'd never fired one, never even held one. Could she even 
find the safety and fire? If so, she had no idea what kind of force to use pulling the 
trigger, or how strong the recoil would be. She'd probably miss; certainly any precision 
aiming would be impossible.</P><P>If she had a sword or bow, she would be confident she 
could beat these men, even though she lacked the powers of the awakened Lunar Priestess. 
She did not have such weapons, though. It was pointless to even waste time wishing for 
them.</P><P>Surfer Boy didn't have the Taser, either. Maybe it needed to be recharged 
before using again? If Chikane did free her hands, he'd have to come close to prevent her 
from freeing her legs. Would he just call his friends, have one cover her while he retied 
her? She doubted it; for one thing they might have wandered off, and for another she didn't 
think a macho type like the surfer would want to admit he needed help to control a teenage 
girl who was tied to a chair.</P><P>So he would probably approach her. She'd only get one 
chance, though. If she tried to get away and failed, they'd likely tie her up more 
securely, and probably "teach her a lesson" about trying it again, besides.</P><P>Chikane 
cast her eyes around the room, taking in everything she could see. Mostly the place had 
been left empty, but for a couple of long worktables near one wall with bits of junk strewn 
on them. She wondered if there was anything useful to be found there. Somehow, though, she 
doubted that Surfer Boy would be nice enough to go inventory it for her.</P><P>No, there 
was no more time for thought or planning.</P><P>She yanked her hands free, the rough help 
scraping her skin, probably drawing blood. He had the beer bottle tipped back again, so he 
didn't notice at once, but when she bent over to reach for her ankles he caught the bigger 
movement and came up sputtering.</P><P>"Hey, what the?"</P><P>He jumped up and ran towards 
her. There was no chance to get her legs free, but she hadn't really expected to get loose 
anyway. She reached back, gripping the sides of the chair back while she bent forward so 
she was standing on her feet. As the kidnapper neared, Chikane spun. Her movement was 
ridiculously clumsy, but her timing was good; she whipped the chair frame hard against the 
side of Cedric's legs at knee level. He stumbled, windmilling, and she slammed back hard 
against him, knocking him onto his back before he could regain his balance.</P><P>Chikane 
didn't trick herself into believing she had time to get her legs free or accomplish 
anything else before Surfer Boy could get back up. He'd been surprised by her escape 
attempt and surprised again when she used the chair against him, but that wouldn't keep him 
down long. Without hesitation, Chikane drew herself up, then drove her body down, slamming 
the chair legs into Surfer Boy's torso and abdomen with her full body weight and all the 
force she could muster. One leg, well placed, rammed into his solar plexus, driving the 
breath out of him in a choked gasp. Before he could catch his breath or try to grab the 
chair to topple her off him she drew herself up and struck again.</P><P>And 
again.</P><P>And again.</P><P>The third try speared a chair leg down on his throat, 
crushing his windpipe and leaving him strangling. She didn't realize that until the eighth 
strike.</P><P>No one had come rushing in by the time Chikane untied the ropes from her 
legs. She stretched, then rubbed her wrists and ankles, trying to restore circulation. Then 
she turned to the body.</P><P><I>I'm sorry, Himeko</I> momentarily flitted through her 
mind. She had killed a man. A criminal, a kidnapper, one who'd surely have tried to kill 
her in the future, but even so he was still dead, and in some vague way she felt like she 
had let her lover down.</P><P>Chikane patted down the body, hoping to find a weapon, but 
only came up with a cell phone and wallet. She took the phone; if it got a signal she could 
use it to call for help. Unfortunately, he had nothing else useful. She went to the junk 
tables and had better luck there. It wasn't much, but there was a coil of sturdy wire on a 
wooden spool. She secured the loose end to a small L-shaped piece of wood that had broken 
off something some time in the past and had herself a serviceable garrotte. It wasn't a 
weapon she was particularly experienced with; holding the strangling cord she felt neither 
actual training nor the subconscious nudge that she felt when she was familiar with 
something from unremembered past lives.</P><P>She had to get them separately. The tattooed 
man and the Japanese were of an unknown skill level and she didn't think she could 
necessarily take them both while weaponless. The best move was to wait, patiently, for the 
next man to take over guard duty from Cedric. They'd said that they'd switch off every 
hour, so how much time did she have?</P><P><I>None!</I> she realized as she heard the 
scrape of the door latch turning, as loud as a gunshot in the empty room. She rushed 
towards the door, playing out the wire between her hands as she did.</P><P>"Hey, Cedric! 
You're a free man!" the tattooed gym rat said as he pushed open the door. An instant later 
he saw Surfer Boy's body sprawled in the dirt and Chikane missing. "Hey, what the 
f—?"</P><P>His words were cut off as the garrotte whipped around his throat.</P><p 
style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P>Machita Ken was furious. That damned American 
detective had pinned him into a corner, all but blackmailed him into continuing the farce 
when no sane businessman would do so. The Himemiya Financial Group was not a charity! It 
had no special interest in Asamiya Tsukuyo. It wasn't even a trip sponsor or otherwise a 
host who might, therefore, have some perceived obligation for the girl's safety.</P><P>But 
no, the detective had not only refused to acknowledge this, he had all but demanded that 
the company play along, with the tacit threat that if it didn't, they'd be smeared 
throughout the press with a PR nightmare if anything happened. And Himemiya Reiko had 
immediately spoken up, pleading tearfully for the sake of her school friend. It was 
pathetic, not even an act of gracious charity extended for kindness' sake but a panicked 
breakdown.</P><P><I>No wonder she's a nothing, a shrinking violet, while some nobody 
becomes her "Miya-sama" and the princess of the school in her place!</I></P><P>It was 
Reiko's lack of poise, grace, self-esteem, awareness of her position, whatever the hell one 
wanted to call it that had landed them in this mess. His initial rage had been directed at 
Vincent Pukui and his crew of idiots—<I>what did they need, a fucking </I>dossier<I> on the 
target?</I>—but now he was beginning to understand just how the mistake had been 
made.</P><P>Another thing to blame Lieutenant Lord for, he thought. He'd kept them in that 
stupid conference for so long that Machita hadn't been able to get out and make a vitally 
important phone call. It'd been nearly an hour and a half before he was able to take out a 
cell, not the sleek black business-model smartphone that he'd used to set up the gathering 
of the ransom money under the eyes of everyone in the conference, but a second phone. This 
one was a cheap model with prepaid minutes, a nearly-untraceable "burn phone." The number 
he dialed was associated with another such phone. There was one ring, then a 
second.</P><P>"Yah?" Pukui's voice snapped out. Machita could hear a car engine in the 
background; the Hawaiian was no doubt returning to the place he'd stashed the 
girl.</P><P>"You grabbed the wrong one," Machita snapped, not bothering with any 
formalities.</P><P>"What?"</P><P>"You took the wrong one! How much plainer can I make 
it?"</P><P>"Hey, don't be pulling this, man. We got the one you told us to go after. 
Carries herself like a fucking queen, even after we snatched her."</P><P>"The problem is 
that Reiko is a little mouse with glasses and braids!" It was an effort to keep from 
screaming, but he knew that he couldn't afford to indulge his temper. "The girl you grabbed 
has nothing, <I>nothing</I> to offer. No connection to the Himemiyas! Just an ordinary, 
middle-class family! With a <I>twin sister</I> who called the <I>police</I>!"</P><P>"That 
bitch! She went and played along when she found we didn't know who she was. Probably 
figured it would keep her alive."</P><P>"Lucky you didn't get her purse and ID and smart to 
realize what it meant—but she's out of both now. Dispose of her and clean up before the 
police get a chance to catch a sniff of what's happening."</P><P>Without waiting for a 
response, Machita signed off the call, then glanced around. No one was in sight, so he took 
out a handkerchief, wiped the cell of any prints, and tossed the burn phone into a refuse 
bin amid newspaper and fast-food wrappers.</P><P>The Hawaiian was lucky, he thought. 
Letting them fade into the underworld, when they hadn't collected a ransom, was easier than 
having his yakuza contacts finish them off. Pukui's mistake had, inadvertently, ended up 
saving his life.</P><P>Too bad it wouldn't help Asamiya Tsukuyo.</P><p 
style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P>The tattooed man clawed at the wire encircling his 
throat, but soon realized that it was too late; it was biting into his flesh and he 
couldn't get any purchase. It was virtually impossible, despite his strength advantage, for 
him to reach behind him and use that strength against his garrotter. It was one of the 
things that made a garrotte such a lethal weapon; the human animal's instinctive responses 
to it were almost useless.</P><P>And, of course, he could not call for help.</P><P>In 
desperation and terror, Rex did the only thing he could do: he braced his feet instead of 
staggering, pivoted, and used his greater size and muscle mass to drive himself backward, 
hammering his strangler's body against the corrugated-metal wall with all the force he 
could muster. The loud clanging of the impact rang out like an alarm bell once, twice, then 
three times, four. His vision was starting to blur when he felt the constant pressure at 
his throat slacken. With the garrotte no longer in place he was able to reach back, get a 
grip on the girl, and then lean forward with all the strength he had, throwing her over his 
back to slam onto the floor in front of him, nearly hitting Cedric's empty chair.</P><P>Rex 
ripped the wire from around his throat and gasped for breath, sucking in the oxygen his 
body so desperately needed. The throw had been a hard one; the girl lay in the dirt, 
momentarily stunned, giving him the time to get his breath back. He was going to enjoy 
breaking her with his bare hands. They might need the Himemiya bitch alive for now, but 
hey, they were going to kill her sooner or later, weren't they, so a little rough work 
didn't matter, right?</P><P>He was so focused on reaching out and seizing her that he 
didn't see her hand close around the neck of Cedric's dropped beer bottle, and he only 
heard the sound of her shattering the glass by swinging it, hard, against one of the chair 
legs. She took him completely by surprise when, as he bent down to grab her, she whipped 
her arm around and drove the jagged ends of the broken bottle into the soft flesh of his 
throat, tearing it open.</P><p style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P>The tattooed man 
wasn't dead by the time Chikane began patting him down, judging by the bubbles of escaping 
air welling up through the blood in the ruin of his throat. The crash of her body against 
the wall had been loud and unnatural; the third man would be on his way. She needed a 
weapon, a <I>real</I> weapon, if she was going to deal with the Japanese in a straight-up 
fight without the advantage of surprise. Did she have any time? Seconds, at 
most.</P><P><I>There!</I> Under the loose-fitting shorts, strapped to the outside of his 
right leg, hilt-down in a sheath, was a knife. Chikane unsnapped the strap around the 
handle that kept the knife from falling out and drew the weapon. It was a Marine KA-BAR, a 
combat knife with a seven-inch blade, meant for both stabbing and slashing. Chikane was 
expert with a <I>tanto</I>, the Japanese dagger, and this was more than adequate as a 
substitute.</P><P>The Japanese kidnapper burst through the door just as Chikane pulled the 
knife free; he had the Taser in hand and whipped it towards her to fire. She dove left 
without trying to rise, rolling away, careful to keep the knife from accidentally cutting 
or stabbing herself, and the barbs whipped harmlessly past her, trailing their coils of 
electric wire. He flung aside the now-useless weapon as Chikane sprang to her feet and 
charged him. If he had a gun it would be touch-and-go if she could get to him before he 
could draw and fire.</P><P>He didn't have a gun, though. Apparently he'd still followed the 
Hawaiian's admonition not to risk carrying one around the prisoner, or else he just didn't 
like them. What he did produce was a <I>tanto</I>, the weapon she'd just been thinking 
about. Steel rang off steel as he parried her first cut, then sprang aside from her second. 
They faced each other, circling, expressions grim. Chikane could tell he knew what he was 
doing from that first exchange, his stance, a dozen cues, and that he ought to be picking 
up the same thing about her.</P><P>There was a difference, though. He had <I>proof</I> of 
what she was capable of. There had been three men, and one teenaged girl tied to a chair. 
Now there was just one man, and the girl wasn't tied any more. How would that change his 
perceptions? Could he react quickly, psychologically deal with what had happened, or would 
he be off-balance, defending himself on instinct rather than by thought?</P><P>She felt the 
ache in her back from where she'd been hammered against the wall, the throb in wrists and 
ankles from the ropes, the soreness in her shoulders from having her arms tied behind her. 
Chikane had her own disadvantages, physical ones, which might slow and distract 
her.</P><P>She knew how to focus past pain and injury, though.</P><P>Nobody could focus 
past their own mind.</P><P>"Come on, Jojo," she invited, remembering his name. "Why don't 
you try something?" She beckoned with her off hand, though not actually moving it out of 
position. "Or do you need me to be tied up first, before you make your move? Of course, 
that's what Cedric did, and it didn't work out so well for him, didn't it?"</P><P>A quiver 
ran through him, a flicker of hate slashing across his features.</P><P>"Try it, Jojo," she 
taunted. "Surely you don't need me to have one hand tied behind my back, do you?"</P><P>She 
took a risk, then, pulling her empty hand back around to hold it behind her. Even as a 
feint, it was taking a chance, because it would only work to her advantage if he did what 
she wanted him to do. If he didn't take the bait—</P><P>But he did. His anger at her 
mockery, his confusion at how she'd so utterly reversed the situation on her kidnappers 
betrayed him, clouding his judgment. He attacked to take advantage of her exposed side, to 
use her arrogance against her as he thought. Only, he hadn't thought the next step ahead, 
didn't see she was ready to pivot away from the attack, catch the wrist of his knife-hand 
between the V of thumb and forefinger to knock it up and away, and rip the KA-BAR in a 
slashing cut along his exposed ribs.</P><P>Pain fueled the Japanese man's fear, weakening 
him, clouding his judgment even more. He tried to close and grapple and got a slash across 
the knuckles of his empty hand for his trouble. Each injury just made it worse for him as 
Chikane steadily, methodically, cut him to ribbons.</P><P>She left the warehouse, the 
sweltering heat and the stink of blood and death, into the late-afternoon fresh air. As 
she'd suspected, they were out in the middle of nowhere; greenery had crept in on all sides 
except for a small clearing in front of the building and the only road away was a dirt 
track. There was no sign of a vehicle, so she assumed that the Hawaiian had taken the only 
one on his errand. Chikane did find some of the men's gear outside: firearms, the Taser's 
charger, a cooler containing beer and sandwiches. She hadn't eaten since breakfast so she 
helped herself to a turkey sandwich on wheat. While she ate, she took out the cell phone 
she'd retrieved from Surfer Boy's body and found, pleasantly, that she had a signal. She 
quickly dialed a familiar number.</P><P>"H-hello?" a voice answered in Japanese, tight with 
worry.</P><P>"Himeko, it's Chikane."</P><P>"Chikane-chan!" Himeko squealed. "Are you all 
right?"</P><P>"I'm fine for now. I got away from the kidnappers, but there's one of them 
left. He went to deliver a ransom tape a while ago."</P><P>"It was delivered. Thank you for 
the message; it made me feel a lot better."</P><P>"I'm glad."</P><P>There was a slight 
pause.</P><P>"Um, Chikane-chan, what did you mean by 'one of them left'?"</P><P>She took a 
long pause before admitting the truth. "What you're thinking. Alive."</P><P>"Are you all 
right?"</P><P>Chikane chuckled.</P><P>"You already asked that, love. Yes, I'm fine. I got 
bumped around a bit, but that's all." The laughter vanished at once as she asked, "Are 
<I>you</I> all right?"</P><P>They both knew what she was asking.</P><P>"They 
<I>kidnapped</I> you, Chikane-chan! The detective said that they'd probably kill you if 
they found out you weren't Himemiya-san!"</P><P>Chikane sighed with relief, unable to keep 
the smile off her face. Killing those men hadn't bothered her in the slightest, but the 
though of disappointing Himeko...<I>And how broken am I, that I can think that 
way?</I></P><P>Less broken than she'd been as the Eighth Neck, in her previous life. 
Perhaps that was all that mattered.</P><P>"Thank you. You said that there was a detective 
there? So you called the police?"</P><P>"That's right."</P><P>"Is he or she still wherever 
you're at?"</P><P>"Oh, yes; he's still here."</P><P>"Good. Can you please put him 
on?"</P><P>There was a long pause, and then another voice came on the line.</P><P>"Miss 
Asamiya? This is Lieutenant Lord, Honolulu Police Department."</P><P>"You're in charge of 
the case?"</P><P>"For now, until the feds show up. Your sister said that you got 
away?"</P><P>"Yes. I killed the three men left with me, but I suspect the fourth will be 
coming back. I don't know where I am and I'm off in the country somewhere, so there's 
nowhere for me to go but into the wilderness. Can you track this phone by GPS and get a 
helicopter up here? You might be able to get here before the last one does and take him 
when he comes back."</P><P>"Is this some kind of joke? You say you <I>killed</I> three 
kidnappers?"</P><P>"They were careless, and after this experience I'm not inclined to make 
jokes. I just want to get back safely to my sister and the rest of the school 
group."</P><P>"All right, just keep this call open and we'll see what we can do." Chikane 
heard him snapping off orders to, she assumed, his subordinates, putting the machinery of 
law enforcement into work, before returning to the phone. "You're okay, though? Do you need 
a doctor?"</P><P>"I've been a bit shaken up, and I'm sure I'll have a few nasty bruises, 
but that's all. I just want to get <I>out</I> of here. There's still most of the school 
trip left, and I really don't want to ruin it for everyone else."</P><p 
style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P>"All right, Miss Asamiya, that's all," Lord said, 
turning off the recorder. He walked over to the interrogation room door. "We'll have a car 
take you back to the hotel." Perhaps surprisingly, everything had gone perfectly; they had 
traced her location to an abandoned agricultural operation, flown in to retrieve her, and 
been in time for two-time loser Vincent Pukui to drive right into their laps.</P><P>"Thank 
you, Lieutenant."</P><P>An officer was waiting when she came out, escorting her down the 
hall. Morishita passed her, joining Lord.</P><P>"Do you believe her, Lieutenant?"</P><P>"No 
reason not to. We'll hold her passport, just in case the forensics pull up something wonky, 
but it looks plain enough. Pukui's singing like a lark, seeing as how he's facing three 
counts of felony murder over and above the kidnapping and assault charges, and Machita's 
lawyer was asking for a plea deal before it even got out of the DA's mouth. The press'll 
make the girl a hero, who fought her way free from vicious killers, so there's no chance 
anyone'll push it, particularly with the international angle. Justifiable homicide, plain 
and simple." His gaze narrowed. "Why, you think something's wrong?"</P><P>Morishita sighed, 
then shook his head.</P><P>"With the facts of the case? No. It's just..." He turned, 
looking back the way Asamiya Tsukuyo had gone. "Watching your interview, that girl...she 
bothers me."</P><P>"She's a pretty exceptional kid, according to her teachers. 
Valedictorian, class president, tennis player, <I>kyudo</I> club captain—what is that, 
anyway?"</P><P>"Japanese-style archery," Morishita provided.</P><P>Lord 
nodded.</P><P>"Yeah."</P><P>"And the three men she killed?"</P><P>"Rap sheets as long as 
your arm, all of 'em."</P><P>Morishita nodded.</P><P>"Yet this paragon, this honor student, 
killed them all. She crushed a man to death with a chair. She garrotted a man, then slashed 
his throat with a broken bottle. She took a third man to pieces in a knife fight. I'm not 
saying it wasn't justified. I'm not saying it wasn't self-defense. I'm just saying that it 
isn't <I>normal</I>. And...damn it, Jack, we've both been cops a long time. We've seen 
posers trying to be badass and we've seen people in shock. She's neither one. She snuffed 
three hardcases and she just doesn't care. The only time she showed any emotion was when 
she talked about that kid sister of hers."</P><P>Lord nodded.</P><P>"I agree. Except, if 
you ask my opinion, that emotion isn't exactly sisterly."</P><P>Morishita's face 
twisted.</P><P>"God, you don't mean—"</P><P>Lord laughed, a hearty chuckle at the liaison 
officer's discomfiture.</P><P>"Jack, what's so funny about that? We're talking about a 
sociopath with an incestuous fixation—"</P><P>"—secretly trained in martial arts and knife 
fighting? I don't think so."</P><P>"Then what?"</P><P>"She's a pro, Ted. Probably the 
sister, or girlfriend, or whatever too. You think this Machita joker is the first to get 
the bright idea to kidnap the heiress? I'm betting, when Miss Reiko went off to high 
school, the Himemiyas ran in a ringer, a baby-faced bodyguard who could keep an eye on her 
at school, on trips, all that, without having to let the girl know she's under 
watch."</P><P>"Then why didn't she just say so?"</P><P>"Traveling under a false passport? 
In this day and age, that'll get her in more trouble than the three dead guys. Plus, after, 
what, three or four years of deep cover, you think she wants to blow it just for our 
curiosity's sake?"</P><P>"Are you going to write any of this up?"</P><P>"Why bother? It's 
just guesswork. I'm not going to make trouble where there doesn't need to be." Lord pushed 
himself out of the uncomfortable plastic chair. "And maybe I'm just talking through my hat 
and you're right about her. Either way, it's not our problem."</P><p 
style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P>"Chikane-chan!"</P><P>The dark-haired girl had 
gotten barely two steps away from the police car that had dropped her off in front of the 
hotel before Himeko engulfed her in a massive hug, squeezing for all she was 
worth.</P><P>"Did you miss me?" Chikane said playfully.</P><P>"Mm-hm!" Himeko agreed 
without a trace of teasing or self-consciousness. "I was really scared, even more then when 
the Orochi were after me."</P><P>Chikane blinked in surprise.</P><P>"But why—"</P><P>"You 
know why, Chikane-chan."</P><P>The taller girl let out her breath in a long sigh, then 
raised a hand to stroke Himeko's hair.</P><P>"Yes, I do. Because I was in danger and you 
couldn't do anything about it."</P><P>"Yeah. It was awful; I'd have been less scared if I'd 
been right there with you. But I'm okay now that you're safe, honestly." She wasn't lying; 
getting over shocks and emotional upsets was one of the things Himeko was really good at, 
much better than Chikane.</P><P>And she had Chikane <I>back</I>. That was what 
mattered.</P><P>"Well, at least we can enjoy a nice dinner and get a decent night's sleep. 
I think we'll both need it if we're not going to yawn all the way through the museums 
tomorrow and give the people there the entirely wrong idea."</P><P>"The 
museums?"</P><P>"The school trip? Tomorrow was supposed the be various cultural 
sights?"</P><P>"Chikane-chan, the teachers...they were going to cancel the trip, after all 
that's happened. Now that you're safe, they'll make arrangements to take us all 
home."</P><P>Her twin looked at her, startled.</P><P>"But that isn't fair! Something bad 
happens to me, and our class loses something they've been looking forward to all year? 
Unless...did you <I>want</I> to go home, Himeko?"</P><P>She shook her head.</P><P>"No, I 
don't. I was having lots of fun, and I was really looking forward to some of the other 
activities! And," she pitched her voice low so it couldn't be overheard by anyone else 
passing by, "I don't want to miss the rest of our 'honeymoon,' Chikane-chan."</P><P>"That 
settles it, then," Chikane declared firmly. "I'll have to have a talk with the teachers 
right away and let them know that they don't have to do anything for my sake. No, better 
yet, I'll talk to Himemiya-san first and we can approach them together. A touch of 'the 
Himemiya family would be deeply shamed if its private affairs caused my classmates 
inconvenience' could go a long way towards helping convince the administration that we 
don't need to make any changes."</P><P>She chuckled softly.</P><P>"Perhaps my best argument 
will be that the police have requested that I remain here for a few more days until they 
can determine they won't need my testimony in court. Why not have fun while we're here 
anyway?"</P><P>There it was, Himeko thought. A problem arose, and already her twin had come 
up with the rudiments of a plan to overcome it, at the end of a day where she had been 
Tased, drugged, abducted, escaped her captors, killed three people (even if they'd richly 
deserved it), and been interrogated by the police over the matter. She had to fight to keep 
tears from welling up.</P><P>"I'm so sorry, Chikane," she said, squeezing her lover's hand 
between her own.</P><P>"But why?" Worry was plain on Chikane's face. "None of this was your 
fault, and you were the one who suffered. You're the one who was worried and afraid and 
upset by it all."</P><P>"Mmn," Himeko agreed, nodding. She knew that Chikane wasn't telling 
a comforting lie, that she really did view—and accurately—her experiences as being more of 
a strain on Himeko than herself. "That's why I'm sorry."</P><P>"...Oh."</P><P>It took a 
long time to heal a broken soul.</P><P>Luckily, they had as many lifetimes as they 
needed.</P>
