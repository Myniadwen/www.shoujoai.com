<h1>Spiral of Destiny (part 8 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kannazuki/index.html">Kannazuki no Miko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nwarford.html">Nathan Warford</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kannazuki/kannanisou-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Kazuki started searching through the remains of the shrine. &quot;Mister 
Ogami?&quot; asked Chikane. &quot;What are you looking for?&quot; 

&quot;The uniforms of the two Shrine Maidens,&quot; replied Kazuki. &quot;With any 
luck, their spiritual powers protected them from the Orochi&#39;s attack.&quot; 
The Solar Mark lit up on Himeko&#39;s chest for a moment. Without even 
thinking, Himeko got down on her hands and knees next to Kazuki and 
started looking for the uniforms as well. &quot;Miss Kurusugawa?&quot; the shrine 
keeper asked. 

&quot;I think I can find it,&quot; Himeko said. She simply looked where her senses 
told her to look. After clearing a few pieces of wood, Himeko found a 
large, wooden box that was still intact. &quot;I found it!&quot; she said. Kazuki 
and Chikane went to Himeko, who opened the box. 

Kazuki stared in dismay. Inside the box was a red-and-white kimono, the 
uniform of the Solar Priestess. However, it was the only thing that was 
in the box. &quot;There should be another uniform in that box,&quot; said Kazuki. 

&quot;Where could the uniform of the Lunar Priestess have gone?&quot; Himeko 
wondered. 

Just then, a bright glow came from behind them. Himeko and Kazuki looked 
to see that the glow from coming from Chikane! Her eyes were closed and 
her clothes were glowing bright blue. As Himeko and Kazuki looked on, 
Chikane&#39;s attire started transforming before their very eyes. Her white 
sandals changed to a purple color, and her flowing, white dress 
transformed into a purple chihaya with one green bead on each shoulder 
and three beads on the arms near the wrists. It was the uniform of the 
Lunar Priestess. 

Chikane opened here eyes and looked at Himeko and Kazuki. &quot;I was wearing 
this when I was locked away in the Lunar Shrine last year,&quot; she 
explained. &quot;It was Tsukuyomi that gave me the white dress so that I 
would be presentable when I returned. I never took it off. It simply 
changed its form when I didn&#39;t need its spiritual powers.&quot; 

&quot;Then we have all that we need,&quot; said Kazuki, rising to his feet. &quot;We 
must go deep into the mountains. There is a cave where the Ogami Shrine 
was originally supposed to be. Due to an irregular event, the location 
of the shrine was moved to Mahoroba.&quot; 

&quot;What event was that?&quot; asked Himeko. 

There was a pause. Kazuki responded, &quot;It may be difficult for you girls 
to take in. When we arrive, you will know.&quot; Quickly moving away from the 
subject, Kazuki said, &quot;It&#39;s a long journey. You must go home and pack 
what you need.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, Mister Ogami,&quot; Chikane said. 

&quot;A day of rest will also do you good,&quot; Kazuki continued. &quot;Using 
Tsukuyomi&#39;s power puts a great deal of stress on your body, does it not, 
Miss Himemiya?&quot; 

&quot;It does get tiring after a while,&quot; answered Chikane. 

&quot;There have never been so many Orochi attacks in such a short time,&quot; 
realized Himeko. &quot;Before now, days passed between attacks. Their most 
recent attack happened after only one night.&quot; 

&quot;With only eleven months since the Orochi were defeated last, their 
memories are still intact,&quot; Kazuki realized. &quot;They remembered the power 
that the two Priestesses possessed, and so they&#39;re much more determined 
this time. But with the shrine gone, the Orochi most likely feel that 
they&#39;ve all ready won. They should not be causing us any major problems 
until we get to the cave.&quot; 

&quot;But if we leave, there won&#39;t be anyone to stop the Orochi from 
destroying the rest of the world!&quot; cried Himeko. 

&quot;It can&#39;t be avoided,&quot; Kazuki said solemnly. &quot;But that&#39;s why the 
Priestesses exist, to remake the world that has been distorted by the 
Orochi&#39;s evil.&quot; 

&quot;But that means--!&quot; 

Chikane raised her hand, motioning for Himeko to stop speaking. &quot;We will 
deal with the consequences when the time comes,&quot; said the dark-haired 
girl. &quot;We&#39;ll defeat the Orochi, and then find another way to remake the 
world.&quot; Chikane and Himeko looked into each other&#39;s eyes. &quot;I promise I 
won&#39;t let Ame no Murakumo take us away from each other again.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, Chikane...&quot; Himeko said. 

&quot;That is a bold statement, Miss Himemiya,&quot; said Kazuki. &quot;I do not know 
if it is possible to change the fate of the Priestesses.&quot; 

&quot;We won&#39;t be defeated by fate,&quot; Himeko said. &quot;Chikane and I love each 
other too much for that. Nothing is more powerful than our love.&quot; She 
then looked at the other girl and said, &quot;Right, Chikane?&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s right, Himeko.&quot; Now knowing that Ame no Murakumo could still be 
revived, Chikane and Himeko regained their faith in their abilities and 
in each other. With the immediate danger over, there was nothing to 
distract them from the love that they felt, and the two girls met in a 
sweet, tender kiss. Having confessed their love to each other and 
accepting their own feelings the year before, Chikane and Himeko were 
not afraid to express their love, even if they were both girls or if 
someone was watching them. 

Unfortunately, the girls&#39; moment together was interrupted by Kazuki. &quot;As 
much as I enjoy seeing the love you have for each other,&quot; he said, &quot;we 
do not have the time. We must prepare for the journey ahead. I will stay 
with Yukihito tonight at the University. We will meet here tomorrow at 
dawn. Please, make sure you get plenty of rest tonight, and make sure 
you eat well tomorrow morning.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, Mister Ogami,&quot; said Chikane and Himeko in unison, both of them 
bowing to Kazuki. Chikane&#39;s priestess uniform transformed back into her 
white dress, and the two girls left the demolished shrine. 

---------- 

Makoto looked out the window of the Kamiyatate University Medical Center 
from her bed. She had suffered a broken leg and a blow to the head, but 
was well enough to sit up. As she looked out the window, she saw below 
her two people walking toward the building. One of them was a tall girl 
with flowing, black hair. The shorter girl with blond hair was the one 
that Mako recognized. &quot;Himeko?&quot; she said to herself. A smile appeared on 
Mako&#39;s face as she realized that her friend and roommate was okay and 
was there to check up on her. 

Himeko knocked on the door to Mako&#39;s room and then entered, Chikane 
following behind. &quot;Himeko,&quot; said Mako happily, seeing her friend enter. 

&quot;Mako...&quot; Himeko said. 

&quot;What&#39;s with that sad look on your face?&quot; the brown-haired girl asked. 
&quot;I&#39;m going to be just fine. It&#39;s just a broken leg and a bump on the 
head.&quot; 

&quot;But still...&quot; Himeko said. 

&quot;Himeko, you&#39;re acting like I just lost the chance to represent our 
prefecture in the next high-school track competition.&quot; 

Mako was closer to the truth than she knew. With the bandages around her 
forehead and her broken leg elevated, she looked just like she had after 
the Orochi attacked the year before. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mako,&quot; said Himeko. 

&quot;Himeko?&quot; said Mako, surprised by what Himeko had said. 

&quot;I wasn&#39;t able to protect you,&quot; the shorter girl said softly. &quot;Even 
after all I&#39;ve seen and done over the past year, I still wasn&#39;t able to 
protect you.&quot; 

&quot;Protect me?&quot; An amused smile appeared on Mako&#39;s face as she asked, 
&quot;What nonsense are you talking about? This wasn&#39;t your fault.&quot; Mako then 
noticed the taller girl standing beside Himeko. &quot;Hello,&quot; Mako said, 
momentarily captivated by the girl&#39;s deep blue eyes. &quot;I don&#39;t believe 
we&#39;ve been introduced.&quot; 

&quot;Chikane,&quot; the girl smiled. &quot;Chikane Murakumo.&quot; 

&quot;Pleased to meet you, Miss Murakumo,&quot; Mako said, reaching her hand 
toward the dark-haired girl. 

&quot;Please,&quot; said the tall girl as she shook Mako&#39;s hand, &quot;call me 
Chikane.&quot; 

&quot;Himeko,&quot; said Mako with a sly grin, &quot;I never knew you were going out 
with such a fox.&quot; 

&quot;&#39;Going out&#39;?&quot; said Himeko, her cheeks turning red. 

&quot;It&#39;s written all over your face, Himeko,&quot; said Mako with the same wily 
tone in her voice. &quot;You love her,&quot; she said, putting an emphasis on the 
word &quot;love&quot;. 

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Chikane said proudly. &quot;I am Himeko&#39;s girlfriend.&quot; 

&quot;Himeko, I think I&#39;m jealous!&quot; Mako exclaimed. &quot;Chikane looks like 
royalty. In fact, she looks just like Takeshi Himemiya&#39;s wife. So much 
so that I would happily call her &#39;Miya-Sama&#39;.&quot; 

Chikane&#39;s breath caught. Another element from her past had returned; a 
student at Ototachibana Acadeny had called her &quot;Miya-sama&quot;. However, the 
dark-haired girl simply smiled and said, &quot;Please, you&#39;re flattering me.&quot; 

&quot;I mean it. You are without a doubt the most beautiful woman I&#39;ve ever 
seen. Himeko is lucky to have a girlfriend like you.&quot; 

&quot;No. I&#39;m the lucky one. I couldn&#39;t ask for a more perfect girlfriend 
than Himeko.&quot; 

Himeko and Chikane looked at each other for a moment and then smiled at 
each other. Himeko turned back to her brown-haired friend and said, 
&quot;Well I&#39;m happy you&#39;re okay, Mako.&quot; 

&quot;Thanks for coming to visit,&quot; Mako replied. &quot;It means a lot to me.&quot; 

For a moment, Himeko and Chikane simply stood in front of the bed. It 
took Mako several seconds, but she started to sense that something was 
wrong. However, before she could ask what it was, Himeko said, &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry, Mako. But I&#39;m leaving for a while.&quot; 

&quot;Leaving?&quot; Mako asked. 

&quot;Chikane and I have a job to do,&quot; explained Himeko. &quot;There is a place 
deep in the mountains that we have to get to.&quot; 

&quot;This has something to do with that giant sphere yesterday, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; 
Mako asked. All Himeko could do was nod. &quot;I see,&quot; said Mako, her head 
falling slightly. However, the smile quickly returned to Mako&#39;s face and 
she said happily, &quot;Well, I wish you luck, you two.&quot; 

The smiles returned to Himeko&#39;s and Chikane&#39;s faces as well. &quot;Thanks, 
Mako,&quot; said Himeko, bowing slightly to her friend. 

&quot;Thank you, Makoto,&quot; Chikane said, bowing as well. 

As Himeko and Chikane started to leave, Mako called out, &quot;Himeko. Hold 
onto that girl. She&#39;s a keeper.&quot; 

&quot;I will,&quot; Himeko called back as she exited the room and closed the door 
behind her. 

Mako looked out the window again and watched as Chikane and Himeko 
exited the building. She smiled as she saw the two girl holding hands as 
they walked off. 

---------- 

Takeshi and Rika sat across from each other in the conference room, both 
of them deep in thought. &#39;How could we have forgotten?&#39; Rika wondered to 
herself. 

&#39;Chikane is our daughter,&#39; thought Takeshi. &#39;I remember it all so 
clearly.&#39; 

The two looked at each other and smiled. &quot;You always wanted a child,&quot; 
said Rika. 

&quot;Why didn&#39;t she tell us?&quot; Takeshi wondered. &quot;Why didn&#39;t she tell us that 
she was our daughter?&quot; 

&quot;She probably thought that we wouldn&#39;t understand.&quot; 

&quot;And yet she called us &#39;Father&#39; and &#39;Mother&#39;.&quot; 

&quot;She probably called us &#39;Mother&#39; and &#39;Father&#39; out of reflex. She didn&#39;t 
think about what she was saying, she just said it. She probably doesn&#39;t 
even know that she called us &#39;Mother&#39; and &#39;Father&#39;.&quot; 

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we tell her that we&#39;ve remembered who she is? And the life we 
had together?&quot; 

&quot;I think it would be best if we just let her be,&quot; said Rika, taking her 
husband&#39;s hands in her own. &quot;She&#39;s under enough stress all ready, being 
the Lunar Priestess, fulfilling her role to revive the God of Swords and 
to save the world. She doesn&#39;t need to know yet.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re right, my dear. You&#39;re right.&quot; Takeshi kissed Rika&#39;s hand and 
said, &quot;I&#39;m just happy that we&#39;ve had our Chikane returned to us. It 
is...going to be difficult to continue acting as if we don&#39;t know 
anything.&quot; 

&quot;I know.&quot; 

At that time, a knock came at the door. &quot;Excuse me Sir, Missus,&quot; Otoha&#39;s 
voice came from behind the door. &quot;Miss Murakumo and Miss Kurusugawa have 
returned.&quot; 

&quot;Already?&quot; Rika said quietly to Takeshi with a confused expression on 
her face. 

Takeshi looked at Rika with an equally confused expression. However, he 
soon looked back at the door and said, &quot;Thank you, Otoha. We&#39;ll be right 
out.&quot; The two adults stood and went to greet Himeko and the girl they 
now knew to be their beloved daughter. 

&quot;Good afternoon,&quot; Takeshi said at seeing Chikane and Himeko walk into 
the house. &quot;You are back earlier than we expected.&quot; 

&quot;The Orochi attacked,&quot; explained Himeko. &quot;The Ogami Shrine was 
destroyed.&quot; 

&quot;Destroyed?&quot; gasped Rika. 

&quot;But there is another place that we can perform the revival ritual,&quot; 
said Chikane. &quot;So we can still revive Ame no Murakumo. But it is deep in 
the mountains. There&#39;s no telling how long it will take us to get 
there.&quot; 

&quot;I see,&quot; said Rika. 

Everyone was silent for a moment. Takeshi then asked, &quot;When do you 
leave?&quot; 

&quot;Mister Ogami said that we should rest for the night,&quot; Chikane answered. 
&quot;We&#39;ll leave tomorrow morning after we&#39;ve recovered our strength.&quot; 

Again, all that Rika could say was, &quot;I see.&quot; Rika then looked at Chikane 
and said, &quot;Chikane, you look tired.&quot; 

&quot;I am,&quot; Chikane replied. &quot;Controlling Tsukuyomi no Mikoto takes a lot 
out of me.&quot; 

&quot;Perhaps you would like some tea?&quot; asked Rika. &quot;Would you like a cup of 
Darjeeling? Perhaps with a spoonful of honey?&quot; 

Chikane stared blankly at her mother for a moment, but then replied, 
&quot;Yes, that would be perfect. Thank you.&quot; 

&quot;Otoha, would you kindly make some tea for Miss Murakumo?&quot; asked 
Takeshi. 

&quot;Yes, Sir,&quot; said Otoha, bowing to her employer. &quot;Right away.&quot; As Otoha 
left to make the tea, Takeshi turned to Chikane and said, &quot;Please, make 
yourself comfortable, Chikane. You don&#39;t want to collapse when you go on 
your journey tomorrow.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you, Takeshi,&quot; Chikane said. With that, Takeshi and Rika left 
toward their room. 

Himeko was expecting Chikane to start walking toward the guest room, but 
the dark-haired girl simply stood there, staring with a surprised 
expression at Rika and Takeshi as they walked to their room. Chikane was 
trying to hide it, but Himeko could tell that something about her 
parents had startled Chikane. &quot;Chikane?&quot; asked the blonde. &quot;What is it?&quot; 

&quot;Darjeeling...&quot; Chikane said. &quot;That was my preferred tea. And I always 
drank it with a spoonful of honey or rose jam when I was tired. Did my 
parents remember that about me?&quot; 

&quot;Maybe it&#39;s because you weren&#39;t part of the world that was remade. All 
of your powers as a priestess remained and they&#39;re affecting the ones 
around you.&quot; 

&quot;Maybe. Or maybe it&#39;s something else. Remember last year when you went 
out with Souma? And the First Neck of the Orochi attacked?&quot; 

&quot;Yes.&quot; 

&quot;Even before the incident with the First Neck, I sensed that you were in 
danger. Maybe it was you that called out to me from the future, or maybe 
I had the ability to see into the future myself. And on your second date 
with Souma, when I saw him kissing you, I remembered everything about my 
previous life, how I killed you and why we couldn&#39;t revive Ame no 
Murakumo. Maybe I just happened to remember before you did, or maybe it 
was my own power that allowed me to see into the past.&quot; 

&quot;Do you think there&#39;s some power inside you that we don&#39;t know about 
yet?&quot; 

&quot;They might just be coincidences. But if I do have some special power 
inside me, then maybe there&#39;s more to the Priestesses of the Godless 
Month than we realized.&quot; 

---------- 

Chikane and Himeko had returned to the guest bedroom by the time the tea 
was ready. Otoha brought the tea up to the guest bedroom where Chikane 
accepted the tea and thanked Otoha, after which the maid exited and left 
the two girlfriends by themselves. Himeko and Chikane were preparing for 
a relaxing, restful afternoon and evening when Chikane sipped the tea. 
Her eyes widened and she looked at the tea with surprise. &quot;This 
flavor...&quot; she breathed. 

&quot;Chikane?&quot; asked Himeko. &quot;Is the tea all right?&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s just fine,&quot; Chikane replied. &quot;It&#39;s just...&quot; she trailed off. As 
Himeko listened intently, Chikane finished, &quot;...I taste sake in this 
tea.&quot; 

&quot;Sake?&quot; Himeko said. &quot;Why would there be sake in your tea?&quot; 

&quot;It was a secret flavor that Otoha always put in my tea when I was 
especially tired,&quot; answered Chikane. &quot;We never were supposed to drink 
the high-quality sake except on special occasions like parties or 
business meetings, so we always kept it a secret from my parents and the 
rest of the maids.&quot; Chikane realized, &quot;Otoha is remembering as well.&quot; 

Himeko and Chikane went to bed early that night. They knew that they 
needed to get up early the next morning so that they could start their 
journey. Chikane was particularly tired from all of the fighting she had 
engaged in with the Orochi, so it was not difficult for her to fall 
asleep. Just like the night before, Himeko and Chikane slept in each 
other&#39;s arms. 

---------- 

Day was just beginning to break when the alarm by the bed started 
blaring in Chikane&#39;s ear. The sleepy 17-year-old reached to the side of 
the bed and hit the alarm clock, knocking it to the ground, breaking the 
device. Chikane looked out the window to see the black sky turning a 
dark shade of blue. Chikane looked at Himeko, who was sleeping 
peacefully in her arms. &#39;I&#39;m sorry about this Himeko,&#39; thought Chikane. 

Knowing that they had to meet with Kazuki at dawn, Chikane was forced to 
wake up Himeko. &quot;Himeko, wake up,&quot; she said, gently shaking Himeko by 
the shoulder. 

&quot;Is it time all ready?&quot; Himeko sleepily asked, her eyes remaining 
closed. 

&quot;It&#39;s time,&quot; Chikane replied. 

&quot;Ten more minutes,&quot; groaned Himeko, wrapping her arms around Chikane, 
pulling herself closer into Chikane&#39;s body. 

Chikane embraced the smaller girl in her arms and said, &quot;I wish we 
could. I really wish we could. But we have to meet Mister Ogami at 
dawn.&quot; Chikane kissed Himeko&#39;s forehead and said, &quot;Come on. I&#39;ll help 
you to the bath.&quot; Chikane lifted the blankets off of Himeko&#39;s body and 
carefully helped the blond-haired girl to a sitting position on the side 
of the bed. She then slung Himeko&#39;s arm over her shoulders, picked her 
up, and half-carried her to the very large bathroom. 

After getting undressed, Himeko and Chikane got into the water, sighing 
in pleasure as the warmth helped to wake them up. Chikane picked up a 
bar of soap and a sponge and started washing Himeko&#39;s back. &quot;Mm,&quot; Himeko 
sighed, &quot;that feels nice.&quot; 

&quot;I always loved it when we could wash each other in this bath,&quot; Chikane 
cooed. &quot;I missed this so much. I missed every moment that I spent with 
you and I wished every day that I could see you again. I was so happy 
when Tsukuyomi told me that I was going back and that I could see you 
again and spend time with you again. I was so happy.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m happy too, Chikane. Ever since my sixteenth birthday, I&#39;ve felt an 
emptiness inside my heart. I missed you too, even though I had never 
known you in this reality. Souma asked me out on my birthday, but I 
still knew that I would meet the person who was just for me some day. I 
was so sure of it that I had to turn him down.&quot; A hint of guilt entered 
Himeko&#39;s voice as she said, &quot;If I had accepted Souma&#39;s invitation, maybe 
he wouldn&#39;t have joined the Orochi this year.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t start thinking like that, Himeko,&quot; Chikane said softly into 
Himeko&#39;s ear. &quot;You can&#39;t start blaming yourself for something that isn&#39;t 
in your control. Remember what happened last year? I felt so guilty 
about killing you in our past life that I couldn&#39;t focus on the present. 
I let my feelings get the better of me and I left you all alone to 
revive Ame no Murakumo all by yourself. I caused you so much pain, which 
is what I never wanted to do. If you start feeling guilty and 
responsible for the horrible things that have happened, you&#39;ll end up 
like I did. And I won&#39;t let that happen to you. I want you to be happy, 
Himeko. All I want is for you to be happy.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you, Chikane,&quot; Himeko sighed, turning around to kiss her beloved. 
After several seconds, they broke and Himeko said, now feeling 
energized, &quot;Let me wash your back now.&quot; 

&quot;Okay,&quot; said Chikane with a smile. The taller girl gave the soap and 
sponge to Himeko and turned around to let Himeko wash her back. 

---------- 

Himeko and Chikane had a large meal of salmon, rice, and bits of 
scrambled eggs for a condiment for the salmon. It was exactly like the 
salmon and shiitake mushroom breakfast that Otoha had prepared the year 
before except that the mushrooms had been replaced with eggs. Himeko was 
happy that mushrooms had not been used for this Japanese-style 
breakfast. She smiled at Otoha, who bowed to Himeko, a smile on the 
maid&#39;s face as well. 

&quot;Thank you for the meal,&quot; Chikane and Himeko said in unison as they 
finished eating. 

As the sun started to rise, Himeko and Chikane started on their way 
toward where the Ogami Shrine used to stand. As they were beginning to 
leave, they heard someone call out, &quot;Misses.&quot; They turned to see Otoha 
standing just outside the front door, holding several boxes in her 
hands, neatly wrapped with red and purple ribbons. Chikane and Himeko 
returned to the house to speak with Otoha. &quot;I prepared these for you,&quot; 
said the maid. &quot;They&#39;re bento boxes with sweet omelet, fresh vegetables, 
assorted sushi, and rice. Just in case you get hungry.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you, Otoha,&quot; said Chikane, taking most of the boxes. 

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Himeko said, taking the rest. 

As Chikane and Himeko started to leave again, Otoha said, &quot;Miss 
Kurusugawa.&quot; Himeko and Chikane turned to look back at Otoha. &quot;Could I 
speak to you alone for a moment?&quot; Himeko walked back to Otoha to hear 
what she had to say. 

For a moment, Otoha stayed silent with a worried look on her face. 
Eventually, she managed to say to Himeko, &quot;Please take care of Miss 
Chikane for me.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;ve remembered, haven&#39;t you?&quot; said Himeko. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Otoha. &quot;I remembered the moment I saw you two up in that 
tree yesterday morning. Has Chikane told you the story of how I tried to 
climb up to her that day eleven years ago?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, she told me.&quot; 

&quot;You succeeded in doing what I could not. She chose you and not me. I do 
love Chikane...but it was not meant to be.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Otoha,&quot; Himeko said. 

&quot;Don&#39;t be sorry,&quot; said the maid. &quot;I&#39;m the one who should be apologizing 
to you. I was so jealous of you that I did everything in my power to 
make you feel bad: making full mushroom courses for dinner and tailoring 
dresses so that they made your beauty less noticeable. Chikane&#39;s body is 
quite perfect, but you don&#39;t look so bad yourself. I eventually realized 
that my misdeeds were not helping anybody and that Chikane would love no 
one other than you. So please, make sure that Chikane is happy.&quot; 

&quot;I will, Otoha.&quot; Himeko then wrapped her arms around Otoha, which made 
the maid very surprised. &quot;Thank you for everything. And I hope you find 
the one for you some day.&quot; Otoha closed her eyes and held Himeko as 
well, thankful for Himeko&#39;s comforting words. The two girls ended their 
short embrace and smiled at each other for a moment before Himeko and 
Chikane left on their journey. 

---------- 

Kazuki and Yukihito were waiting for the priestesses outside the remains 
of the shrine, both of them dressed in clerical Shinto robes. Himeko 
changed into the red uniform of the Solar Priestess and Chikane&#39;s 
clothes transformed into the purple uniform of the Lunar Priestess. 
Ready to leave, the two priests and two priestesses started their 
journey east, into the snowy mountains of the Japanese wilderness. 

To be continued... 

---------- 

OMAKE: 

&quot;Himeko, I think I&#39;m jealous!&quot; Mako exclaimed, looking at the 
dark-haired girl standing next to Himeko. &quot;Chikane looks like royalty. 
In fact, she looks just like Takeshi Himemiya&#39;s wife. So much so that I 
would happily call her &#39;Miya-Sama&#39;.&quot; Mako turned to Chikane and said, 
&quot;You are without a doubt the most beautiful woman I&#39;ve ever seen. I tell 
you, if I could stand, I would pounce on you right now and have hot 
lesbian sex with you all night long!&quot;
