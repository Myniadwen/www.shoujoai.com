Anton Chekhov - To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life 
are already three parts dead.

A quote that has lasted in peoples memories for over a century, 
capturing the essence of one of the most precious and natural human 
traits out there. The line catches one of the biggest insecurities, 
biggest uncertainties that has plagued some - if not most - humans minds 
and answers it simply: If it wasn&#39;t meant to be it wouldn&#39;t happen. 
Fearing something that happens naturally to every being is like fearing 
why you naturally have to defecate, it won&#39;t get you anywhere and in the 
end you may do it without a warning.

But back onto the subject...

The quote is one of many that&#39;s been said, that have caught the truth 
for most people. It&#39;s opened the eyes of whoever have read it and it has 
given light into more perspective for those people that have been unable 
to make decisions on it, for person&#39;s who have grown insecure about it 
and for fools that could never decide in any which way to follow it or 
not.

*BWAP*

Picking myself up from that jarring face-fault into the table I start 
wondering, why did all those damned gods keep me away from this 
impeccable wisdom. This could have really been useful a few years ago...

&#39;Chikane-chan!&#39;

Ohmigosh! Koi! Where are you my little wallflower? Come here into your 
blue-haired princess&#39; arms, I&#39;ve missed you so!

I can feel your slender arms beneath mine already, my eyes do not even 
need to lay their glory upon your goddess like being. Your warmth is so 
strong that it reaches me even in the darkest dungeon, the dampest cave, 
the emptiest cavern; honestly if I didn&#39;t know better I would believe 
that you&#39;re in my arms right no-

&#39;...Chikane-chan? Why are you hugging Otoha-san?&#39;

&#39;...?&#39;

Opening my eyes-...why do I have my hand there? Why do I have my 
hands...ANYWHERE OTHER THAN AROUND HIMEKO!? What is this, this doesn&#39;t 
fit the picture, I&#39;m hugging the wrong person.

I&#39;ll just jump away, like so.

&#39;Ah~ Moushiwake arimasen, Ojou-sama. That was my fault...&#39;

&#39;No, I should apologize. I shouldn&#39;t be...hugging people...at random 
like that.&#39;

&#39;I...understand, Ojou-sama.&#39;

...

Now, normally I would have said something intelligent to jump kick this 
awkward moment or I would maybe just dismiss it. But today it just 
seems- &#39;GOD DAMMIT, say something Hi-me-ko!&#39;

Yes, save me, my Golden Haired Princess! *insert mental swoon*

Thankfully though, it seems that due to our nature of being the Miko 
Priestess&#39; of the Sun and Moon we seem to have acquired some sort of 
emotional link so we could save each other from any despair, anger, 
frustration or in this case a very annoying situation. The reasoning? 
Himeko just let out one of her utterly cute sneezes after a butterfly 
landed on her nose; it couldn&#39;t possibly be a coincidence!

Well actually...thinking about it, I think my emotional link was 
probably set up with the Goddess Insecta after that one party the 
Deities and I were having in Purgatory...

&#39;Chikane-cha~n, can we go now?&#39;

&#39;Yes, let us go. Where do you have in mind, Himeko?&#39;

&#39;Ah! The amusement park, I haven&#39;t been there in so long...and I&#39;ve 
never went with Chikane-chan...&#39;

Aww, you&#39;re so cute, yesh you are! I just want to pinch your cheeks 
you&#39;re so cute, pouting like that and looking so sad...you&#39;re making me 
sad...and happy because you look so cute!

&#39;Alright do you want us to go now?&#39; Formality has been built into me, so 
what? You wanna fight about it? Yes, behind the bushes over their in the 
mud; I&#39;ll hire some random body guard to fight you for me, okay?

&#39;Yes! Can we? Can we, can we, can we?&#39;

&#39;Of course Hime, we&#39;ll go whenever you like.&#39; Which seems to be now 
so...

Skipping along the stone steps towards the limousine that awaits us in 
the front of my home, my eyes hold firm on the beauty that walks beside 
me. Honestly, I can&#39;t help but smile; she&#39;s so gorgeous, people might 
say that she looks childish but to me she&#39;s perfect. She&#39;s always happy, 
sad at times which makes her so much more endearing because she can do 
what I cannot; she can be sad...or at least openly show it. The love my 
heart holds for her may have just carried over from my predecessor, but 
my heart also knows that it would have been hers no matter what the 
situation was around us.

She&#39;s so fun to be around, always shining like the sun, throwing herself 
open for everyone and anyone to read...jumping and skipping like that, 
whistling one of her favorite songs tunes without a care, craning her 
head and staring up at the sky so enthralled by its nature even now, 
after living her life under its warm gaze for her entire life and 
spending most of her days with me now outside and alive shes so openly 
captivated by everything.

...Even after being hit dead center in the face by bird feces shes still 
endearing to me.

&#39;WAAAAH! CHIKANE-CHA~N!&#39;

Ah...I love you so much Himeko, my cute Golden Princess.

&#39;Coming Himeko...&#39;

-----
 
God knows, that I&#39;m going to hell for this Cracketry. I don&#39;t believe 
I&#39;ve ever openly tried going for something humor-centered so my fingers 
are crossed for good results. &gt;.&lt;

Anyways, this came to me after watching several Kannaduki no Miko AMV&#39;s 
as well as (coincidentally) watching several episodes of Ren &amp; Stimpy 
after. Somehow this just came to me and somehow it changed like...ten 
times before I finally decided what hit Himeko in the face at the end.

Anyways hope you enjoyed the read.

Ja
