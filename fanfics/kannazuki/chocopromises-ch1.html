<h1>Chocolate Promises</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kannazuki/index.html">Kannazuki no Miko</a>

<P>"You owe me chocolates, Himemiya-san."</P><P>"Himemiya Chikane looked up in surprise 
from the documents she was poring over.</P><P>"And I'm not talking about a box, either. 
More like ten pounds' worth, or more."</P><P>Chikane blinked.</P><P>"Hanada-san, what are 
you talking about?"</P><P>Hanada Satomi pushed herself away from the doorjamb where she'd 
been leaning.</P><P>"Valentine's Day, <I>kaichou</I>, and the chocolate I'm <I>not</I> 
going to be getting this year because of you."</P><P>Hanada had been Chikane's mirror image 
throughout most of their school years; where the Himemiya heiress was the "princess" of the 
school, Hanada was the "prince." Chikane was elegant and feminine, while Hanada was tall, 
rangy, with close-cut hair, a face that was more handsome than beautiful, and indeed when 
inevitably she got to play the male leads in class plays could hardly be told from a 
boy.</P><P>Not surprisingly, both girls had been idolized by their classmates throughout 
junior high and high school. They weren't really rivals in any sense (although their fans 
sometimes were), being more like complementary parts.</P><P>At least until a couple of 
months ago.</P><p style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P>"So, is that homemade love-love 
chocolate for Miya-sama?" Saotome Makoto asked her best friend, wiggling her eyebrows at 
the red foil bag in Kurusugawa Himeko's hand.</P><P>"Mako-chan, you know I can't cook," 
Himeko protested.</P><P>"Well, yeah, but I figured maybe that rock you're lugging around 
gave you inspiration."</P><P>Himeko glanced down at her engagement ring and blushed. She 
still wasn't used to any of it, the idea that her relationship with Chikane was not only no 
longer secret but positively official. She'd been so certain that she was going to be 
kicked out when her parents had returned early from their weekend trip to find the girls in 
an unmistakably compromising position. Her father had been furious and her mother 
distraught, which was nothing compared to how scary Chikane's grandparents and parents had 
been—the Himemiyas were a thousand-year-old family, after all, steeped not only in wealth 
but in tradition.</P><P>But, Himeko had found the courage to stand firm in the face of it 
all, and her refusal to back down had given Chikane the chance to turn on her charm and 
somehow by the end of it the lovers were officially engaged. The details of the wedding 
planning were still up in the air due to the legal questions (the current plan being for a 
ceremony followed by Himeko being adopted by Chikane's uncle so that she'd legally be part 
of the Himemiya family but still legally far enough apart to be able to properly wed if 
Japan finally allowed homosexual marriage), but it was something real and exciting all the 
same.</P><P>"I'd have liked to," she admitted. "But...I did try, two years ago, 
remember?"</P><P>Makoto thought for a second, then burst out laughing.</P><P>"Oh, yeah, I 
remember that one, all right. How long did it take you to get the chocolate out of the fan 
in the oven hood?"</P><P>"I didn't," Himeko sighed. "We had to buy a completely new 
one."</P><P>"Ouch. So you bought something for her instead? Well, edibles are always good 
to give the Girl Who Has Everything, since she has to eat every day and stuff. What is 
it?"</P><P>Himeko held open the bag and let Makoto peek inside.</P><P>"Damn, girl, are you 
sure about that one?"</P><P>"Chikane-chan <I>likes</I> raspberry-flavored dark chocolate," 
Himeko defended her choice.</P><P>"I was thinking more about the presentation."</P><p 
style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P>"Hanada-san, how am <I>I</I> costing you 
chocolates?"</P><P>"Uh, hello, <I>kaichou</I>, you decided to get engaged to another girl? 
None of this schoolgirl-crush, Class S, romantic friendship stuff but 
we're-going-to-spend-our-lives-together-as-a-married-lesbian-couple."</P><P>Chikane 
smiled.</P><P>"Of course I did. I love Himeko very much."</P><P>"That is completely not the 
point."</P><P>"Personally, I think it's the entire point."</P><P>Hanada 
shrugged.</P><P>"Well, yes, as far as the engagement goes, but I'm concentrating on my lack 
of chocolate rather than your future happiness."</P><P>Chikane nodded.</P><P>"I'm trying to 
follow."</P><P>"Well, the problem is that <I>Miya-sama</I> is a lesbian. So the whole 
school is buzzing about the idea of two girls together. Serious, honest, no-holds-barred 
romance between women."</P><P>"And?"</P><P>"How many chocolates did you get last 
year?"</P><P>"Oh."</P><P>"Yeah, 'oh.' It's pretty ordinary, really, for girls who don't 
have a specific boy they like—even here, in a co-ed school—to give chocolates to other 
girls they admire, whether it's a case of pure idolization for a <I>sempai</I> or whatever. 
I bet when you and Kurusugawa-san were still keeping your relationship secret she used that 
so she could give you chocolate without it seeming unusual."</P><P>"She did," Chikane 
agreed. "Are you saying that this year it's different? Because Himeko and I are open in our 
relationship?"</P><P>"Yep. I know you're not much for listening to gossip, so I doubt 
you've heard, but it boils down to things like, 'I want to give chocolate to <I>sempai</I>, 
but I don't want her to think I'm like Kurusugawa-san!' Stuff like that. The girls who 
think you're some kind of pervert for being gay are the loudest, of course, but even the 
ones who support you are thinking twice. I've even heard some girls asking each other if 
dressing up their feelings of admiration like they were romantic might be demeaning to 
actual lesbian girls who are coming to terms with their sexuality. Let's face it, when one 
of the"—she grinned—"two most popular girls in school outs herself, it makes people start 
<I>thinking</I> about things they otherwise wouldn't."</P><P>"I see," Chikane said. She 
supposed that mixed reactions were only to be expected, ranging from outright bigotry 
through ignorance and curiosity to respect.</P><P>"So basically, thanks to the two of you, 
this year if a girl gives chocolate to another girl it's because she means it as a love 
confession, just like with a guy. Maybe more so, since there's no <I>giri-choco</I> for 
other females. So instead of getting a bag full of chocolates from all my fans—one of the 
few times, I may add, that I ever actually get anything out of them—"</P><P>"Please, 
Hanada-san, I know that you love playing to the crowd and being 'the prince' that the boys 
try to live up to."</P><P>Hanada chuckled.</P><P>"All right, that's true," she admitted. 
"But even so, instead of that I figure I'll get maybe two or three which I'll have to 
figure out how to refuse politely instead of keeping because I'm not going to play games 
with their feelings. Ergo, you owe me chocolate."</P><P>Chikane smiled at her.</P><P>"But 
Hanada-san, I can't give you chocolate. It's not appropriate for an engaged girl to be 
giving Valentine's Day chocolate to someone other than her fiancee."</P><P>"Oh, that's all 
right. You can wait until Monday to pay up," the vice president volleyed easily. Chikane's 
laughter cost her the opportunity for a quick counter as a knock on the door cut 
in.</P><P>"Come in!"</P><P>The door opened and Himeko peeked around the 
edge.</P><P>"Um...am I interrupting?"</P><P>"No, Hanada-san was just leaving. She seems to 
be suffering from a sugar deficiency this morning, so you can ignore her."</P><P>"Er, 
um..."</P><P>Hanada laughed.</P><P>"Don't think too much about it, Kurusugawa-san. Your 
fiancee's feeling sassy. Hey, Saotome-san, is that you back there?"</P><P>"Uh huh. What say 
we leave the lovebirds alone, <I>fukukaichou</I>?"</P><P>"Suits me."</P><P>"Oh, by the way, 
Himeko, if clothes are going to start coming off, lock the door 
first."</P><P>"Mako-chan!"</P><P>"Don't tell me you didn't think it. Bye, 
now!"</P><P>Hanada went out and closed the door behind her, leaving Chikane and Himeko 
alone. Himeko walked towards the desk, but Chikane got up and met her halfway.</P><P>"Happy 
Valentine's Day," Chikane said, slipping her arms around her love's waist, savoring the 
feel of the other girl's softness against her body. They kissed, a gentle brushing of lips, 
before she let Himeko step back.</P><P>"Happy Valentine's Day, Chikane-chan."</P><P>Himeko 
held out the red foil bag decorated with silver hearts. Chikane took it and eagerly looked 
inside. When she did, she felt a slow smile start to creep over her face.</P><P>"Oh, now I 
see what Saotome-san meant."</P><P>"Um, it's okay, isn't it?" Himeko asked 
nervously.</P><P>"Of course it is! Well...except for the part where you're giving it to me 
in the morning, at school, and I'm going to be thinking about it all day."</P><P>Himeko's 
blush went from rosy pink to cherry red.</P><P>"That's what I was hoping," she said in a 
very small voice.</P><P>"Minx!" Chikane kissed her again, warmly. "Still, you know, there 
is one problem with getting me body chocolate for Valentine's Day." Her imagination 
twitched as she thought of ways in which she'd apply it to Himeko's skin.</P><P>"What's 
that?"</P><P>"Even though it's my favorite flavor of chocolate, I'm always going to think 
the serving dish tastes better."</P>
