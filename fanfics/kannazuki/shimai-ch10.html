<p>A  hawk perched on the limb of a cherry tree, its talons firmly gripping  a branch that seemed too thin to support its weight. In the deep  shadows, all of its feathers looked as black as pitch, the only  sparks of color about it seeming to come from the depths of its eyes.   Below it, spreading out on the hillside, was a stretch that had been  cleared and flattened by human hands for their use. From there  lights gleamed: the blue frost-lights of illumination, the cruel  brilliance of amethyst, and a pale gold that seemed as cold and  remote as the moon.</p>
<p>The  hawk sat. And watched. And waited.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>Reiko  slashed the black sword down in a sharp motion as if cutting down an  enemy. At the moment when the tip pointed towards Tsukuyo, a blast  of violet-tinted energy launched itself towards her. The Lunar  Priestess had swept her sword from its sheath in an <em>iai</em> draw,  though, and the blade pulled the attack to itself, parrying the bolt  and sending fragments shattering.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  not going to run this time,&quot; Tsukuyo said. She extended her  hand, pointing the blade at Reiko in a gesture that seemed like a  formal challenge. &quot;If you think that you can defeat me, then  come at me now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That  sword...it's not just--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  am a shrine maiden of the God of Swords. This blade is as much a  part of me as the Shadow of Take no Sukunazuchi is of you, Orochi.&quot;</p>
<p>Her  gaze was cold and unmoving as it fixed on Reiko. The First Neck  tried to match the intensity of it, but found herself starting to  tremble, her will evaporating.</p>
<p><em>It's  just like always,</em> she thought. <em>Just  like how everyone thinks she's the princess and I'm the hanger-on if  they meet us together. If anyone was watching us, they'd think </em>she<em> was the Orochi come to destroy </em>me<em>!  Even at this...Even at this, she...</em></p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot;  she screamed. &quot;No, damn it, you are <em>not</em> doing this to me again! I am going to carve you out of my life  forever, Lunar Priestess, and when you die, the world dies with you!&quot;</p>
<p>Tsukuyo's  expression did not change. It was cold and inhuman; she might have  been carved from granite, the way she did not move. She wouldn't,  Reiko knew. The Lunar Priestess was too strong to be pushed aside by  mere words.</p>
<p>She  would not break, and so she would have to be broken.</p>
<p>With  a scream, Reiko leapt into the air. She released one hand from her  sword and swept it along the flat of the blade, as if scooping up the  energies that ran along it. She hurled violet fire down on Tsukuyo,  the assault preceding her descent, sword swinging down to cleave the  Lunar Priestess while she was coping with the first attack.</p>
<p>Only  it didn't happen that way.</p>
<p>Tsukuyo  sidestepped the hail of fire, then swept her sword across the edge of  Reiko's. Pale gold light wreathed the blade, matching the dark  energies of Reiko's black sword. With the supernatural forces  canceling one another, Tsukuyo's precise stroke turned aside Reiko's  wild one, and in the instant Reiko's feet touched the ground and she  was adjusting her balance from the landing, Tsukuyo pivoted, carrying  Reiko's sword out and away while simultaneously letting her deliver a  crushing kick to the Orochi's ribs, left exposed while her sword arm  was engaged. Reiko went over, crashing into the pavement with  jarring force, but she rolled and came back to her feet.</p>
<p>The  power of her dark god surged into her, soothing the pain of the blow  just as it had healed her nose, which Tsukuyo had broken in the first  fight. A bruise or two wouldn't even hamper her. She'd come off  second-best in the exchange but it meant nothing for the outcome.</p>
<p>Didn't  it?</p>
<p>The  First Neck brought her sword up into a guard position. Tsukuyo faced  her, again waiting for Reiko to make the first move. She did,  lunging once, twice, both times having her attacks blocked with  contemptuous ease, but the third time rather than finish the stroke  she unleashed another blast of energy from the sword's tip--</p>
<p>--Only,  Tsukuyo wasn't in front of it. The blast seared through empty air  and struck a parked car, detonating it in a ball of flame. Tsukuyo  had stepped in past her outstretched arm and drove the hilt of her  sword into Reiko's belly. The Orochi gagged and choked, and Tsukuyo  whipped the swordhilt up to crunch into her nose, breaking it <em>again</em> and knocking Reiko over.</p>
<p>The  Lunar Priestess cracked her foot into Reiko's wrist, sending the  Shadow-sword skittering away across the parking lot. The First Neck  could feel the blood streaming down over her lips and chin as she  looked up at the girl she'd idolized nearly all her life. The car  she'd blasted had turned into a cloud of billowing orange flame  cradled in a metal shell, and the ruddy light painted Tsukuyp's face  in golden-bronze. The tip of her sword pressed against Reiko's  throat.</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko  has always felt sorry for you,&quot; Tsukuyo said, &quot;so I'm going  to tell you something that may give you some understanding. As one  of the Necks of Orochi and heiress of the Himemiya family, are you  aware of the legend of the Solar and Lunar Priestesses?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of  course!&quot; Reiko spat back. &quot;You fight against us, to summon  Ame no Murakumo and prevent Yamata no Orochi from bringing  destruction!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And  that we are born into this world over and over again, reliving this  fight through many lives every time your god rises?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Y-yes.   What difference does it make? In the end, <em>this</em> life is all that matters. We'll end your lives here and finish that  cycle forever.&quot;</p>
<p>Tsukuyo  smiled at her then, lips twisting up thinly, cruelly.</p>
<p>&quot;Would  it make a difference if I told you that in my previous life, my name  was Chikane Himemiya?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>No!</em>&quot;  Reiko screamed in protest. Her hand whipped around, her palm  cracking against the flat of Tsukuyo's sword to knock it away from  her throat. She rolled in the opposite direction, heard the point  strike off the asphalt, and rolled to her feet. The black sword  manifested in her hand again--not flying to it, but just appearing,  for it wasn't a physical object but a manifestation of a god's  power--and came back at Tsukuyo. She swung wildly but furiously,  infusing her power into every stroke so that the parries jarred the  Lunar Priestess, making her give ground.</p>
<p>Reiko's  advantage lasted only seconds, though, as Tsukuyo ducked a stroke,  came up, grabbed Reiko's arm and spun her past, slamming the Orochi  face-first into a minivan.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Yes.</em> I was the Himemiya heiress.&quot;</p>
<p>She  torqued Reiko's arm until it broke; the sound of the bone snapping  was audible. Reiko screamed.</p>
<p>&quot;Of <em>course</em> you aspired to be me. I was <em>raised</em> to be what you sought after.&quot;</p>
<p>She  hooked her foot around Reiko's ankle and slammed her to the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;I  am not that stupid fool any more! I am Orochi!&quot; Reiko cried out.   The blood had stopped; her nose was knitting itself back together.   If she could only get a moment to gather herself...</p>
<p>Tsukuyo--no,  Chikane--wouldn't give her that moment. She grabbed Reiko by the  hair, hauled her to her feet, and drove her into the van again.</p>
<p>&quot;So.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Slam.</em></p>
<p>&quot;Was.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Slam.</em></p>
<p>&quot;I.&quot;</p>
<p>Reiko's  mind reeled, unable to comprehend.</p>
<p>&quot;I  was the Eighth Neck.&quot;</p>
<p>Reiko  called her sword back to her left hand, tried to swing it, but the  blow was clumsy and Chikane slashed her shoulder, disarming her  again.</p>
<p>&quot;You  can't mean it...&quot; Reiko forced out, her voice shaking.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't  I?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  glared at her contemptuously.</p>
<p>&quot;I  destroyed my family, my friends, people I had known since childhood.&quot;</p>
<p>The  tip of her sword flashed out, slashing Reiko's other shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;I  summoned the Gattai Orochi itself.&quot;</p>
<p>She  slashed Reiko's left cheek.</p>
<p>&quot;I  drowned the cities of the world in wave and fire, storm and  earthquake.&quot;</p>
<p>Next  was Reiko's right cheek, but she barely even noticed the pain. Hot,  wet tears clouded her vision, but they were tears of despair, not  pain.</p>
<p>&quot;You  have spent every moment of your life, including this one now,  trying--and failing--to become me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No!  Nooooo!&quot; Reiko wailed, and she hurled herself wildly at Chikane.   She didn't even think of her weapon, but just flailed at her with  her fists, wanting her to stop, to take it back. The Lunar Priestess  an Orochi? It was unthinkable! And yet, this casual cruelty, a side  she'd never before shown Reiko...</p>
<p><em>Because  I didn't matter enough to show it.</em></p>
<p>She  fended Reiko off easily, flinging her back against the van, <em>still</em> with  that faint smile on her lips, damn her! It was almost a bad joke.   Reiko had challenged her with the accusation that she'd gone through  life without a single real friend, no connections at all besides her  sister. She'd accused Chikane of being a failure because of it.</p>
<p>But  that wasn't true at all. The face she showed Reiko now was the face  of a girl who <em>liked</em> things  that way. The face of someone who could have become more of a  monster than any of the Necks.</p>
<p>Idly,  almost as an afterthought, Reiko wondered what it was that had held  her in check.</p>
<p>Then,  the Lunar Priestess Blade slashed across her belly and agony engulfed  her. She cried out, dropping to her hands and knees.</p>
<p>&quot;You  should have figured out how to be a genuine Reiko instead of a  fourth-rate, imitation Chikane.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  kicked Reiko over onto her back, then raised the sword for what might  have been the final strike. The blade swept down, and in terror  Reiko let the black fire of Orochi consume her, her god carrying her  away to the shrine of eight gates.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>The  hawk watched as the victorious Lunar Priestess slowly turned away  from where her victim had fallen and slowly, deliberately walked back  towards the hospital. Billowing smoke spat up from the shell of the  burning car, the orange and black colors the aftermath of violence  and savagery.</p>
<p>It  dipped its head once, as if nodding in satisfaction, and then spread  its wings to leap into the night sky, its dark plumage vanishing  against the blackness.</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane!  Are you all right? What happened?&quot; Himeko gasped out the moment  her sister came into her room.</p>
<p>&quot;Happened?&quot;  Chikane said.</p>
<p>&quot;The  blood on your vestments is kind of a clue,&quot; Marika observed.</p>
<p>Chikane  glanced down, seeing the stains. They weren't particularly large,  but the red stood out against the white fabric like an alarm sign.</p>
<p>&quot;It's  not mine,&quot; she hastily told Himeko. &quot;I didn't get hurt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  what was it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...Reiko.&quot;</p>
<p>Marika  got to her feet.</p>
<p>&quot;And  that would be my cue to leave. Don't yell at her too much, Himeko;  remember that the doctor said you need rest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Reiko  was <em>here</em>?  You went out and fought her? <em>That's</em> why you let Marika come in first!&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;I  felt her...well, felt something outside. I'm not exactly sure how,  but it seems that since my full powers were unsealed my perceptions  are stronger.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And  you just went out there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If  I had let her come in after me, people could have been hurt like they  were at the college.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  flinched, because it was her own point thrown back at her. She'd  been the one to insist that people mattered--and she <em>still</em> believed it; they <em>did</em> matter.</p>
<p>&quot;Out  there,&quot; Chikane added, &quot;the fight was as far away from you  as I could make it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  why didn't you tell me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It  would have just worried you,&quot; she dismissed it.</p>
<p>&quot;But  I <em>want</em> to worry about you!&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  gave her a strange, confused look. Thinking about it, Himeko  realized that her word choice hadn't exactly been clear.</p>
<p>&quot;I  mean, I know that as I am, I can't fight alongside you. All I'll do  is get in your way and make you take chances to keep me safe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That  isn't what happened when the Orochi attacked yesterday. She'd have  killed me if you hadn't been there.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  really glad I was able to help, but even so that was really a fluke.   But even so it just makes my point stronger! I don't want to be left  alone in the dark, not knowing what's happening. I...I know it's  silly, but I feel like if I can at least cheer you on, then some part  of me can be standing with you while you fight.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  blinked in surprise as the words sank in, then bent her head and  sighed.</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko...&quot;  She shook her head ruefully. &quot;All I wanted was to protect you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're  not <em>supposed</em> to protect me, Chikane. We're supposed to be partners, right? Okay,  maybe not as priestesses any more, yes, so you're going to be doing  the actual fighting when it's necessary. But emotionally at  least...I love you, Chikane, and I don't want us to be apart.&quot;</p>
<p>She  extended a hand to the other girl, and Chikane came over and took it.   With a heavy sigh, she sat down in the visitor's chair placed next  to the head of the bed.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  sorry, Himeko.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's  all right. I know you do it because you care; you just take it too  far sometimes.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  looked at her, then flicked her sapphire gaze around the room and her  face fell.</p>
<p>&quot;And  sometimes not far enough.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're  lying in a hospital bed, Himeko! You're here because I insisted, I  all but begged you to carry out the ritual with me. You might have  been seriously hurt, or even killed! It's only <em>luck</em> that I...that I...&quot; Tears began to well up in her eyes, and  Himeko's heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane...Chikane,  no, that isn't right. I went along with you because I wanted to!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  you <em>didn't</em> want to. I had to all but force you into it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,  but...that's not because I was afraid of getting hurt. I just  thought it wouldn't work, that having me along would ruin it. If  you'd said that you knew it <em>would</em> work but that I'd be risking myself doing it I'd have gone along at  once.&quot;</p>
<p>They  stared at each other for a long instant, then as one burst into  sheepish, embarrassed smiles.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen  to us,&quot; Chikane said. &quot;We sound like the couple from 'The  Gift of the Magi.'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;First  Marika, now you? Why is everybody comparing me to foreign books  today?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe  because you're blonde?&quot; Chikane giggled, her happy face making  Himeko grin.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,  so what's this one?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's  about a married couple who love each other very much but are poor.   They want to get each other special Christmas gifts, so the wife  sells her hair to a wig-maker so she can buy her husband a chain for  his heirloom pocket watch, while he sells his watch so he can buy  combs for her to wear in her hair.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,  that's so <em>sweet</em>!&quot;  Himeko exclaimed. &quot;They loved each other so much...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's  the 'gift' in the story's title, the tangible proof of how much they  cared for each other. But it's like us, too--we'd sacrifice for each  other without a second thought and the only thing that holds us back  sometimes is that we know the other one wouldn't be happy at all  without us.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  smiled warmly at that.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  glad you know it now, though.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  blushed.</p>
<p>&quot;I  wish I'd been better at believing it before; it would have saved us a  lot of trouble last time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,  I'm not really so good at explaining things, and I was pretty  confused myself, but we're together and that's what counts. So, no  more sneaking off to do dangerous things without telling me?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  sighed.</p>
<p>&quot;All  right. I promise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good!  So what happened?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  flinched, and the reaction made Himeko glance down at the bloodstains  on the Lunar Priestess's vestments.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane...Did  you kill her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No;  she ran away before I could finish her off.&quot; She looked her  sister in the eyes, her expression angry. &quot;I'm not going to  apologize for it, Himeko! She's an Orochi now, whatever she was  before, and this has to be settled. In the end the Necks will either  kill us or we'll kill them. There's no other way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did  I ask for an apology?&quot; Himeko snapped back. The sudden flare of  anger made Chikane flinch back again, and it even surprised Himeko,  but she didn't run from the feeling. &quot;I'm not made of spun  glass, Chikane. I know I'm naive sometimes and I know I can be  silly, but I'm not stupid. I've been a priestess of Ame no Murakumo  for as long as you have, after all. I know what it means, and that  there are things we...you, I guess, now...have to do. I'm not afraid  of that.&quot;</p>
<p>For  a second it looked as if Chikane was going to give in to her urging,  but then she looked aside, shaking her head.</p>
<p>&quot;It's...it's  not that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then  what?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  clenched her fists in her lap.</p>
<p>&quot;You'd  be ashamed of me.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  sighed, shaking her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane...Chikane,  look at me.&quot;</p>
<p>Reluctantly,  the dark-haired girl obeyed.</p>
<p>&quot;Do  you honestly believe there is <em>anything</em> you can do that will make me hate you? <em>Anything?</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Slowly,  Chikane shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;No.   No, I don't. I tried so hard to make it happen last time, did so  many awful things, and I couldn't break your love for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then  talk to me. I know that as long as we're together we can bear  anything, no matter how awful.&quot; Even to Himeko it sounded  trite, but...she meant it, <em>really</em> meant it, and there was no other way to express it than the plain  truth.</p>
<p>Chikane  nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;I...tried  my hardest to destroy her. Our powers were closely matched, I might  even have had an advantage as an unsealed priestess against a sealed  Orochi. In fighting ability, though, there was no comparison. Reiko  isn't like the Sixth Neck; she's just...Reiko. She was in the kendo  club in high school for a year, probably because I was, and she was  awful, so bad that she essentially washed out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She  didn't stand a chance?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Not  unless I got careless. Her Shadow is a sword, and her power flows  out of that. She can use it in other ways, but her ability to fight  with it <em>as</em> a sword is the core of that power, and since she <em>can't</em> fight, it's hollow. I've spent my last two lives at least training  in combat arts, and who knows how many before that.&quot; She shook  her head. &quot;But that's not it. I...talked with her while we  fought.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  didn't quite understand.</p>
<p>&quot;I  told her about my past life as Chikane Himemiya, including the fact  that I was an Orochi.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You  told her that?&quot; Himeko was a little bit hurt. They'd discussed  it together before telling the Ohgamis.</p>
<p>&quot;Becoming  an Orochi seemed to have given her confidence and willpower that  she'd never had. I thought that if she knew that even in that she  was still just tagging along after my past life it would break down  her will.&quot; Chikane smiled wanly. &quot;It...worked.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;  Himeko didn't get it at once, but then caught on to what her twin  meant. Reiko had spent her whole life idolizing Chikane. Knowing  that she was still firmly in Chikane's shadow even as an Orochi, and  having that knowledge driven home during a battle in which Chikane  was demonstrating her physical and supernatural superiority...</p>
<p>Some  of her thoughts must have been plain on her face, not that she was  any good at hiding her emotions, because Chikane's expression became  sad.</p>
<p>&quot;You  understand, don't you?&quot;</p>
<p align="center">-X  X X-</p>
<p>It  had all been so easy, Chikane thought. The instant that she'd  recognized Reiko's newfound and dangerous confidence, she'd realized  how she could shatter it. She'd proceeded to do so, drawing out the  physical punishment so she could better inflict mental damage. It  had been viciously, deliberately cruel, and at least in the short  term highly effective. By their next meeting Reiko would likely be  hounded by despair or consumed with rage, either condition making her  highly vulnerable.</p>
<p>And  it hadn't bothered Chikane in the slightest.</p>
<p>Not  until she came through the door into Himeko's room.</p>
<p>It  was almost as if she was &quot;borrowing&quot; Himeko's conscience  while in her presence. Things that she was capable of doing in an  eyeblink suddenly became troublesome when around her lover. It was a  strange feeling, which she didn't entirely understand. She couldn't  even tell if it was a strength or a weakness--did Himeko take away  the dispassionate control she needed to be an effective fighter, or  did she lend her emotion that made her better able to function as the  Lunar Priestess?</p>
<p><em>It's  no different, really, than the ritual we performed.</em> Should she feel guilty for making Himeko take part and risk herself?  Or was it her insistence that Himeko help that had insured it worked,  giving her the power that she'd used to defeat Reiko?</p>
<p>&quot;Was  it...&quot; Himeko said, then paused, swallowing nervously. &quot;Was  it very bad?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;I...wouldn't  have wanted you to see it,&quot; she said very softly. Was that  right? &quot;No, to see me doing such things,&quot; she corrected her  statement.</p>
<p>Himeko  squeezed her hand.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  glad I didn't have to,&quot; the blonde admitted, &quot;but that's  because I don't have the strength to do those things.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Strength?  I'd hardly call it that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  it is! The Chikane I know is a wonderful and kind person, even when  you don't want to be. I mean...I know Reiko always annoyed you, the  way she was your fan instead of being herself. It sort of hurt your  pride as a Himemiya even though you're not one anymore, right? But  you never brushed her off or said nasty things or were mean to her  until now, since she's become an Orochi.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's  not kindness, Himeko. You have to care about other people to be kind  to them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  if you didn't care, you'd have just swatted her away like an  irritating fly. Maybe that's not 'kindness,' but it's something,&quot;  Himeko insisted. It almost made Chikane want to laugh, the way  Himeko relentlessly looked for the good in her. At times it felt  like her beloved didn't so much <em>find</em> that goodness as actively created it within her. &quot;So that's why  it's 'strength' to be able to do awful things when it's necessary. I  don't think that I could bring myself to, even if I thought of them,  which I don't. So you end up having to bear that burden for both of  us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You  have a unique way of looking at things,&quot; Chikane said, halfway  laughing.</p>
<p>&quot;Did  it not come out right?&quot; Himeko asked with a cute little pout.</p>
<p>&quot;No,  I think you said it perfectly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because  I do mean it, Chikane. I know how hard it is on you to always be the  one who ends up with bloody hands. So...that's why I want to share  those burdens with you, all right?&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane  nodded hesitantly.</p>
<p>&quot;All  right.&quot;</p>
<p>Telling  her was one thing, but knowing how strongly Himeko felt about being  there to protect Chikane's heart made Chikane all the more determined  to shield Himeko herself. If she wasn't the Solar Priestess, then  the least Chikane could do for the girl she loved was to stop forcing  the burdens of that role upon her, and to insure that she was able to  live a happy life. There must be no more leaving her alone,  unprotected in the open where the Orochi could get at her, and  certainly no more requesting that she assist in Chikane's actual  duties.</p>
<p>Chikane's  free hand, the one not holding Himeko's, gripped the sheath of her  sword more tightly as she made the vow to herself. But it was  feeling the blade beneath her hand, the incongruity of being allowed  to bring it into a hospital room, that made her think of something  else.</p>
<p>How  was it that Marika had noticed the Lunar Priestess Blade at first  glance?</p>

<p><em>A/N:  It was really fun to get to write Chikane being evil in this chapter!  Yet another significant difference between the manga and the anime  (as these author's notes continue to highlight incessantly) is how  separate the two versions of Chikane really are (as opposed to the  Himekos, who are essentially the same person, though I'd argue that  the manga Himeko is more consumed with her dedication to Chikane than  the anime one is). The anime Chikane isn't anywhere near as damaged  as the manga one is--she's essentially, as the final episode  highlights, a 16-year-old girl who was pushed beyond endurance,  forced to do terrible things for the sake of her beloved.</em></p>
<p><em>It's  significant that exchange is missing in the manga.</em></p>
<p><em>Manga  Chikane is, above all, more scheming than her counterpart. Every one  of her actions has multiple purposes, multiple agendas to fulfill.   I've gone into it a bit in the course of the story itself, already,  but it's an important difference to highlight. She plans ahead,  thinks geometrically. Anime Chikane might well have done the same  thing to Reiko in this chapter, but she'd have done it because she  was pushed to it by Reiko's attacks and her fears over Himeko and her  own self-doubts. Manga Chikane </em>deliberately <em>chose  to assault Reiko's self-esteem as well as her body as a tactical  combat decision.</em></p>
<p><em>I've  wondered just how it was possible that someone with Manga Chikane's  personality has the capacity to feel the selfless love for Himeko  that she so obviously does (even to the point of being willing to  condemn her soul to eternal imprisonment to get Himeko </em>permanently<em> out of the cycle of death and rebirth!). The best explanation I can  come up with is that Chikane was originally a loving, kind girl, and  the centuries have basically broken her down until the only part of  her core humanity that remains is the part that loves Himeko--it's  the strongest connection she feels to another, and therefore it's the  last to go. Whether or not she's capable of recovering in future  years, now that she's managed to &quot;find&quot; Himeko's love is an  open question.</em></p>
<p><em>It's  particularly open since the cycle of </em>this<em> story is nowhere near to being resolved.</em></p>
<p><em>Incidentally,  just for the record, I absolutely loathe &quot;The Gift of the Magi.&quot;   While I understand how most people seem to see it--indeed, how  Himeko sees it!--I look at that story and I see a perfect example of  how a lack of communication and a selfish desire for the &quot;grand  gesture&quot; can damage a relationship. The &quot;gift&quot; is  superfluous because they </em>ought<em> to be affirming their love for one another </em>every  day<em>,  without need for Absurdly Epic Sacrifices--in short, that learning  that they'd sacrificed for one another should tell them nothing that  they don't already know! My wife agrees in part; she thinks it's  sweet, but she also thinks it's &quot;a total waste; both of them  were stupid.&quot;</em></p>
