text-indent:.5in'>It was already way past midnight, yet Yui, lying on her side,
was still fully awake. She should have been able to close her eyes without
having them spring open just a heartbeat later, providing that just a few hours
ago, she and her loving companion, Yue, had lain in each otherÅfs arms, tangled
in the linen beddings, so exhausted they barely had the strength to breathe.
She should have been able to sleep, as Yue once in a while would whisper into
YuiÅfs ears the lullaby composed from words of love before the silver-haired
girl drifted off to her own slumber. Yui should have been able to even have
sweet dreams &#8211; denied to her during the last three thousand years sometimes by
feverish nightmares and most of the times, tearful sleeplessness &#8211; for she now
had what she wished for most, never-ending bliss and the eternal company of the
most magnificent girl in the world. She but wondered if her restlessness
tonight was caused by the happiness that had been welling up in her soul, or
the fear that all of this &#8211; the girlÅfs warm and even breaths tickling against
YuiÅfs neck, the smoothness of her snowy skin under YuiÅfs hand, or the softness
of her small and fragile body engulfed in YuiÅfs embrace &#8211; were but illusions
created by her vicious father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Carefully, Yui rolled Yue off her arm, laid the girlÅfs head
gently on the soft, fluffy pillow, then rose quietly from the bed. She took a
white yukata hanging over the changing screen and wrapped it around her bare
body. Afterwards, she went to the far side of the room in the Lunar Shrine,
slid open the shoji door, and sat down on the wooden floor, gazing at the dark,
faraway horizon. The Moon looked even more lifeless than ever with its surface
torn apart by seemingly bottomless cracks formed during the battle between Yui
and Izanagi the Lord of Izumo a couple of days past.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>She sighed. Although Yui and Yue had rebuilt the Lunar Shrine
without breaking a drop of sweat, they were but powerless when it came to
bringing life back to the deserted Moon. This place &#8211; once called the Land of
the Eternal Light, honored as the most beautiful sanctuary in the Creation
Realm &#8211; had been so <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>thoroughly</span></i>
destroyed by the fight between Rinne and Akira three thousand years ago that
not a spark of life was left beneath the ground. Yui doubted anything short of
the Mirror of Life could return the MoonÅfs long-lost beauty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgYui-chan?Åh a crystalline, melodious voice called, followed
by the soft sounds of footfalls upon the wooden floor. Yui turned her head, and
found herself washed over by a wave of wonder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Even though most of the room was occupied by darkness, Yue
still managed to be as radiant as if she stood amid sunlight. Silver hair
falling in a straight, glossy stream to her feet, body covered loosely in white
bed linen, showing skin on her neck, her shoulder, her long and slender legs,
the Goddess of the Moon walked toward Yui and stopped upon reaching her. Yui
looked up at her sweetheart, feeling as though drown in a sea of wine. The
Immortals of Heaven were wrong when they kept insisting that Yui was the most
beautiful being in the Three Worlds, for she believed only Yue was worthy of
such title. She was not the only one who held onto that opinion, of course.
Izanagi the Lord of Izumo, whether heÅfd admit it or not, obviously agreed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgWhy are you out here, Yui-chan?Åh Yue asked softly while
settling gracefully on her knees next to where Yui sat. With the <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Åg-chanÅh</span></i> added, the
silver-haired girl turned YuiÅfs name into the cutest sound ever. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgI couldnÅft sleep, so I didnÅft want to disturb you,Åh Yui
answered with a smile. ÅgHow about <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>you</span></i>?
Why are <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>you</span></i> awake?
You were just snoozing soundly just a minute ago.Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgWell, I...Åh Yue began. For some reason, she stopped abruptly
after that, face growing redder by the minute. The beautiful girl looked away,
then, clutching the bed linen at her front more tightly with her hands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgOh, I see.Åh Yui laughed softly. ÅgYou couldnÅft sleep without
me next to you, is that it?Åh Judging by YueÅfs face, the very picture of the
setting sun, and the embarrassed gleam in her silver eyes, YuiÅfs arrow must
have flown true.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgYouÅfre so cute, Yue-chan,Åh Yui whispered into her
sweetheartÅfs ear and gave her a light peck on the cheek, turning the face of
the Goddess of the Moon even redder, if that was possible. Smiling, Yui put an
arm around YueÅfs back and pulled her closer while her vacant hand gently cupped
the silver-haired girlÅfs chin and raised it up. Their mouths found one another
in a deep kiss that took their breath away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;Even after their lips had parted, Yui didnÅft release
her cuddly companion. She slid a hand beneath YueÅfs knees, lifted her up, and
placed the silver-haired girl on her lap. Although the Goddess of the Moon gave
a surprised squeak at first, she adapted to the situation quickly. She settled
her arms around YuiÅfs back, propped her head upon YuiÅfs shoulder, and nuzzled
her nose against YuiÅfs neck while muttering things that Yui found utterly
unintelligible. On the other hand, they sounded so adorable in YueÅfs sweet
voice that Yui would be perfectly happy to listen to them all night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Sighing in contentment, Yui hugged her sweetheart tightly,
leaning down to kiss her forehead or her cheek once every so often. Sometimes,
the other girl would reach up and kissed her lightly on the lips, perhaps out
of gratitude, or perhaps she just wanted to &#8211; Yui couldnÅft tell. They stayed
that way for another while, enjoying each otherÅfs blessedly heart-warming
company. Yui almost wanted to pinch her cheek just to make sure that this was
not a wishful dream. She could not help, really, when she had spent the last
three thousand years thinking that she was hated by the one she loved, when she
had spent every moment, dreaming and awake, grieving for the first eighteen
years of her life. She could not stop herself from doubting reality, for after
all, the memory of that sorrowful day still seared her heart. It might take a
while for her new-found happiness to heal it completely and forever remove its
scar....</p>

text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Face soaked
with tears, which had started overflowing as soon as she woke, Yui stared at
the darkness that hung about the ceiling. The holographic clock read twelve
noon, yet only the light of a lamp post standing outside, beneath the dark,
starless heavens, shone through her opened window. Of course, the Sun had died,
just as she was about to herself. Once she drew her last breath, the Sun would
explode on the spot, for they could not exist without one another. Well, Father
would do something about that, naturally. No doubt he would create a new Sun
and name a new Goddess to take YuiÅfs place. She only pitied the mortals what
would die before the light of the new Sun would once again warm the Earth. In
fact, according to what Izanagi-sama had told her every time he came here and
tried to rouse her from her depression, a lot had died already. Her Father said
that some froze to death while most became food in the bellies of the monsters
born from the dead of night. Yet, try as the man might, he could do nothing to
bring back to Yui the will to live. After all, why should she even want to? A
life where she couldnÅft see the one she loved ever again was simply not worth
the effort.</span></i></p>

text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>From when
Yui was little, she had always liked Yue more than anyone else in the world.
Growing up, it took her little time, and effort, to realize that she had found
in Yue the other half of her existence, the one she wanted to spend immortality
with. During their adolescent years, she had strived to stay by YueÅfs side,
trying her best to make the girl happy without saying right out that she had
fallen in love. Perhaps she was shy, perhaps she thought that it wasnÅft that
necessary, or perhaps she feared Yue would be horrified at her abnormal love.
Or perhaps a little bit of each of these, Yui didnÅft know for sure what she felt
at that time.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Then that
day came, when Yui invoked the power of Inochi no Kagami to save the flower Yue
had brought to Heaven from their most recent excursion trip to the Earth. She
almost lost her life wielding the Mirror, but it was worth it, for Yue had
given her something she had desired for a very long time in exchange. A kiss on
the lips, a declaration of love from her most precious person. It was a mere
touching of lips, yet it meant more than anything that could be told.
Overwhelmed by the sensation and the affection that flowed into her soul, also
from the fatigue of wielding First Supreme, Yui had passed out... just to
regain consciousness a few days later when words were brought to her that Yue
had returned to the Underworld.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Seized with
incredulity, she had rushed to see her Father the Lord and ask for the reason.
In his study, she found a man driven over the edge with rage, who snarled at
her like a beast that she had better vanish from his sight before he ripped her
head off. Later, her brothers, the young Susanou and Kagutsuchi, told Yui that
the newest quarrel between Izanagi-sama and Izanami-sama had hammered the last
nail on the coffin of the relationship between Heaven and the Underworld.
Furious, the Lady of Reiha had decided to take Tsukiyomi the Goddess of the
Moon back to her home City and severed all ties with Izumo. War was imminent.
Yui hardly cared, for she had passed out once again as soon as she learned that
Yue would probably never come back.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>From that
point on ward, she spent her days crying her heart out in her room. She didnÅft
touch a grain of rice or a drop of water. As her spirit spiraled downward into
depression, immortality failed her. Time began to tug at her body, reminding
her that her aging process had started. Her celestial power waned, thus forcing
the Sun to shut down as a result. The eternal night plagued the human world.
Yet again, aside from pitying the mortals, Yui hardly cared. In fact, had she
had the strength, or the </span></i>opportunity<i><span style='font-family:
"Footlight MT Light"'>, to commit suicide, she would have. Izanagi-sama,
perhaps able to sense her wish for death, had cast upon her a spell that would
stop her from doing herself harm. Worse, he planted all sorts of listening
devices in her room to make sure he could response in time to whatever Yui did.
Sometimes, Yui didnÅft know whether the man cared about her well-being or that
of the Sun. Izanagi-sama seemed to have given up, though, for several months
had gone by since Yui saw him last.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

a soft, emotionless voice said. ÅgWould you just stop brooding and get on with
your life?Åh Sei no Tsurugi no Rinne, in her white outfit and cloak, was looking
at Yui coldly from the opened shoji door. The brilliant light from her eight
wings, folded behind her back, banished the darkness of YuiÅfs room in no time.
It was as though a sun had just emerged.</span></i></p>

Akira!Åh</span></i></p>

Akira,Åh Rinne continued, Ågbut Kagutsuchi-nii-sama and Susanou-nii-sama as well.
They are so concerned about your health that they too, have grown much thinner
during the last several months. I know you miss Tsukiyomi-sama but this cannot
go on any longer. Think of what would happen to your brothers should you die,
nee-sama.Åh</span></i></p>

pillow at Rinne, which burst into flame and fell apart before it reached her
face. The Seraphim Blade looked at Yui frostily, eyes narrowing, fists
clenching, eight wings trembling behind her back. As far as Yui knew, </span></i>no
one<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'> had ever dared do that to
Rinne. </span></i></p>

Yui screamed. For a moment there, Yui thought the platinum-haired girl would
march to her bed and haul her off the room by the scruff of her neck. She sure
had the power to, now. Luckily, Rinne turned on her heel, slammed the door
shut, and left without saying a word.</span></i></p>

text-indent:.5in'>From the morning after their first night together to the
following evening, Himeko had lain snugly in her princessÅfs arms, listening to
her story about how Kannazuki Aoi and Akari grew up and inevitably fell in
love. Of course, the other girl didnÅft leave out the fact that the Original
Priestess of the Moon was relentless when it came to teasing the hell out of
her beloved. Oh, how Himeko had been shocked realizing that ever since the
awakening, such a terrifying habit had transferred into Chikane-chan <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>whole</span></i>. Now, the blue-haired
princess made fun of Himeko and pulled tricks on her at every chance she had.
Worse, the other girl didnÅft even mind doing that in front of the Head Maid
either. Kisaragi Otoha-san had burst into laughter yesterday seeing Himeko
gagging at her food, which apparently was <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>loaded</span></i>
with shiitake mushroom secretly <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>minced</span></i>
by the princess herself. Himeko had spent the next hour sulking in her room
with Chikane-chan locked outside, thumping on the door and begging for
forgiveness. Well, Himeko would have let the girl in much earlier had she not
realized that when Chikane-chanÅfs voice was racking with <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>hilarity</span></i>, she didnÅft sound
sorry at all.</p>

and pulled her into her embrace. Then she kissed her. As the other girl smiled
at her warmly afterwards, HimekoÅfs irritation dwindled away. Sighing, she
snuggled closer to the one she loved and decided to forget about what just
happened. The blue-haired princess was right. As long as Himeko was in her
armsÅf reach, there was just simply no way she could remain mad at her forever.
On the other hand, Chikane-chanÅfs teasing was somewhat... cute, if not quite
amusing and enjoyable, although Himeko would die before she admitted that.
Furthermore, it wasnÅft like the cool, calm, and collected Himemiya Ojou-sama
had disappeared anyway. Her <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>occasional</span></i>
teasing and typical jokes aside, HimekoÅfs sweetheart had been much more than
loving, passionate, and gentle the rest of the time, <i><span style='font-family:

furiously.</p>

looked up at the other girl and tugged at the lapel of her yukata, almost
sounding jealous. It was a foolish question, as she and the Original Priestess
of the Sun were but one and the same person. Yet, she wanted to know.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Himeko blushed harder. Indeed, during the last two days, they
had spent almost all of their time in this room. Well, Himeko and her beloved
mainly sat next to one another and talked to their heartsÅf content, once in a
while enjoyed a few kisses, or indulged themselves in each otherÅfs company.
Still, the people in the Mansion didnÅft seem <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>able</span></i>
to believe that. Himeko was once almost embarrassed to death upon hearing two
maids wondering out loud <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Åghow
Ojou-sama and Kurusugawa-sama got the energy to keep </span></i>it<i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'> up.Åh</span></i> While she was
standing stiffly like a lamp post, red-faced, Chikane-chan had doubled over
laughing and startled the poor, mistaken women. Like Himeko, the two had not
gotten used to this new aspect of their Ojou-samaÅfs personality yet. This time,
she blamed Kannazuki Aoi for it.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgWhat is the next item on the reports, Fuyura?Åh sitting on
the armchair behind her large desk in her office, Izanami said while trying to
reorganize the files in her computer. After a few futile attempts of deleting
out-dated documents and creating new folders and directories, she gave up in an
exasperated sigh. Book-keeping, electronic or no, was just not her strong
point. Maybe she needed to let Fuyura at it for a while. The girl was good at
this stuff. Once, Izanami had had the chance to look at her ChancellorÅfs
holographic monitor screen and be amazed at how cleanly and systematically
organized her files were.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Izanami chuckled in amusement. It just happened two days ago,
actually, when Izanami accidentally erased a document she was viewing. Since it
was a joint report from the Landscape and Environment Bureau and the Soul
Administration Bureau, who were asking for larger shares of budgets in
expanding the Heart of the Underworld due to the sudden rush of immigrants from
Izumo to Reiha, it was extremely important and needed to be dealt with in a
timely fashion. Of course, she could never ask the Bureaus to send her that
file again; they would fall over laughing to death. Who had ever heard of the
head of a country being a failure when it came to electronics anyway? Which was
why she had secretly snuck into FuyuraÅfs office after purposely sending the
girl out for an errand and attempted to retrieve that same file. She did, but
she also came across something else that was definitely more interesting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>It turned out that Fuyura had a folder somewhere in her
Virtual Drives, where she stashed pictures she had surreptitiously taken of <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Izanami</span></i>. It had been very
heart-warming and enjoyable going through them, watching herself in various
expressions and poses in the pictures, although Fuyura certainly did not think
that way. The girl had fainted dead once she had opened the door to her office
and found her target of affection completely engrossed in browsing through her <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅgsecretÅh</span></i> older. Once Fuyura
had regained consciousness, she had literally shoved Izanami out of her office
and declined any of IzanamiÅfs attempts to apologize. Even now, after Izanami
had summoned the girl here and forced her to go through the daily reports, the
young Chancellor still hid her face behind her PDAÅfs holographic screen and
avoided looking Izanami in the eye. The dark-haired girl... was just plain
adorable.</p>

Messengers of Izumo have successfully restored order to the Human World, as the

very pleased receiving the order that she had better come into IzanamiÅfs office
and do her duties or be dragged in by the scruff of her neck, by her own
sisterÅfs hand. ÅgWith the assistance of the Mirror of Life, the memories of the
Earthlings have been completely modified. And of course, no traces of

paled, her whole body starting to quiver in shock... and rage. ÅgAnd I also want
you to vacate your office immediately.Åh</p>

shook. ÅgDoes that mean you want to deprive me of even the right to look at the

at it, too?Åh A good many Immortals working for Izanami in Reiha, if not most,
were afraid of voicing their thoughts and opinions even though sometimes she
was the one who made mistakes. Tsukazaki Fuyura was <i><span style='font-family:
"Footlight MT Light"'>not</span></i> among those. Being the straight arrow that
she was, the girl would march into IzanamiÅfs office and said to her face what
she had done wrong without a scrap of deference. A strange thing, that, for the
girlÅfs blood sister, Tsukazaki Haruhi herself, did not seem as keen in speaking
out.</p>

every single day, is there?Åh She kissed the girl. The young Chancellor
stiffened visibly; yet a heartbeat later, she yielded beneath IzanamiÅfs lips
and returned the kiss. As FuyuraÅfs arms tightened around IzanamiÅfs back, the
PDA in her hand fell and cracked open upon the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

particular interest in women. It turned out she was wrong. Ever since she
learned that Tsukazaki Fuyura harbored a deep crush on her, things had changed,
and she found her fondness for the girl growing after every time they exchanged
words. The young Chancellor was a brilliant and witty conversationalist &#8211;
although her views on dealings with other people were a little bit on the
extreme side &#8211; a very efficient employee, and the most lovable partner one
could wish for in IzanamiÅfs opinion. She had no idea how she never noticed how <i><span

the girl came to the Underworld.</p>

excuse that she did not like the girl enough to take her for a lover. Fuyura

IzanamiÅfs chest hurt just from recalling it. She wondered how she could have
been so cruel.</p>

YuiÅfs arm, Haruhi smiled and said, managing even a little bit of fondness into
her usually cold voice. ÅgThe Rosenkyuu misses you.Åh An amused smile curved her
lips as her gaze traveled to the third girl in the room, Yue, who looked
suspiciously like someone who had a bottleful of vinegar forced down her
throat. ÅgYou too, of course, Tsukiyomi-sama.Åh Haruhi made it sound as though an
afterthought, probably on purpose.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgI am sure it does,Åh Yue said in a strained voice and shot
Haruhi a heated glare afterwards. Oh yeah, Yui forgot. The Goddess of the Moon
got jealous fairly easily. All it took to ignite the flame inside her heart,
all it took to raise a forest of thorns within her soul, was probably as simple
as a <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>look</span></i> at
another woman. And Yui just gave Tsukazaki Haruhi a <i><span style='font-family:
"Footlight MT Light"'>hug</span></i>.... Yui swallowed. This was not going to
be good.... She guessed she should put more distance between her and Haruhi.
Yui stepped back. The glare cooled down somewhat. For some reason though, Yue
looked awfully <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>cute</span></i>
when she was jealous....</p>

wondering whether she should cut back on the <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅgHaru-chanÅh</span></i>
bit also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgYes, Izanami-sama wishes to meet with both of you, Yui-sama,

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The grip Yue placed on YuiÅfs arm when they walked past the
Portal Haruhi created was much firmer than usual, and the other girl was
resting her head on YuiÅfs shoulder, pressing her body as close to YuiÅfs as
public decency permitted. It was as if the girl wanted to prove to Haruhi that <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>she</span></i> was YuiÅfs girlfriend.
Yes, absolutely adorable indeed. Yui chuckled quietly to herself. Maybe she
should try to make Yue jealous more often. Maybe Haruhi would even lend help.</p>

echoed her in unison.</p>

the age of fifty, the tall, lean twenty-ninth Leader of the ancient, utterly
wealthy, and exceedingly powerful Himemiya Clan still managed to look not a day
beyond thirty. Short and somewhat gray hair framed a face any woman would call
pretty, yet a face no man would say soft. In his grave black suit and necktie,
he was the very picture of formality, propriety, and willpower. Strict and
quite unrelenting, the Master could make a stone weep if he tried hard enough.
He became a totally different, if not opposite, man when it came to his beloved
daughter, though. There had been times when Otoha thought that Ojou-sama could
twirl the man around her fingers.</p>

you.Åh Himemiya Kimika-sama smiled and patted Otoha warmly on her shoulder. No
older than the Master of the Himemiya Clan, yet appearing much younger, the
Mistress was pretty in her well-cut dress and coat, undoubtedly made from the
most expensive material and with the best hand. Yet, she in her finest dress,
jewelry, and makeup would still pale beside her daughter in plain clothes.
Well, that was hardly a surprise, actually. No one looked pretty compared to
Himemiya Chikane-sama, of course. </p>

another bow and motioned the servants to clear a path for the Master and the
Mistress. Her breath caught, however, when she straightened up and her eyes
fell on the person standing behind Kyou-sama and Kimika-sama. It was a pretty
girl roughly Chikane-samaÅfs age whose long black hair was tied into a neat
pony-tail hanging at her front, whose eyes sparkled emerald under the glorious
sunlight, whose clothes were as colorful as any stage performer. She was
Ojou-samaÅfs distant cousin. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Himemiya...

word, despite the anger bubbling in her heart. She had not been pleased at all
being told that Chikane-sama and Kurusugawa were going to see a movie... in a
dimly lit theater... probably with very few people around... doing Heaven knew
what. On a bright note, though, Kurusugawa Himeko was not going to enjoy this.

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgYou still watch even though it scares you... because of
that?Åh Chikane said faintly.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgI just want you to have fun, preferably with me, thatÅfs
all.Åh Even in the darkness of the theater, HimekoÅfs blush was plain. Her grip
on ChikaneÅfs arm became softer and much more loving before it tightened in
fright because the boring vampire in the movie had just found yet another
utterly brainless human from whom he sucked blood and eventually massacred. But
Chikane did not care about them now, did she?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgWe are leaving,Åh Chikane whispered into HimekoÅfs ear before
she took the little angelÅfs arm and stood up, pulling the girl along. Together,
they treaded carefully down the steps and left the screening room shortly
after. Once they were out in the hallway, littered with people chatting
excitedly about the movie they just saw or were about to, Chikane wrapped her
arms around her sweetheart and claimed her soft, honey lips. It happened so
quickly that Himeko barely had time to be surprised before she put her arms
around ChikaneÅfs neck, rose on her toes, and daringly returned the kiss.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgWhatÅfs with you, Chikane-chan?Åh Himeko said, amethyst eyes
glancing at her surrounding, cheeks warming up so rapidly Chikane could even
feel the heat wafting off. The hallway had become deathly quiet as though
someone had found the ÅgMuteÅh button and pressed it. The people nearby, men and
women alike, were looking at them, some in shock, some in amusement, and some,
disgust. Parents, who failed to act in time to cover their childrenÅfs eyes,
hastily led the kids away while muttering things under their breath.
Undoubtedly curses, those. However, a good many remained, seemingly quite
interested in seeing what was going to happen next between two girls in
matching outfits, who just engaged in a steamy kiss where everyone could see.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgI am sorry, Himeko,Åh Chikane apologized.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgFor what?Åh The inquiry came with a smile and a tilting of
the girlÅfs head. Somewhere in the background, someone chuckled, which Chikane
was unsure whether from sarcasm or amusement. Yet, she still did not care, as
the girl she loved was looking at her with a fond yet exasperated expression.
ÅgWhat have you done to me this time?Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgWell,Åh Chikane cleared her throat and told the little angel
everything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The disaster began with the fading of the color from HimekoÅfs
cheek, followed by the drop of her arms from ChikaneÅfs body and the arrival of
a horrified look upon her face. Then the girl broke out crying. Chikane felt as
though something just gnawed at her heart. She had never thought <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>she</span></i> would make the little
angel shed even a drop of tear one day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgI have no excuse, but forgive me, Himeko, please,Åh Chikane
pleaded. When she tried to hug the girl, Himeko slipped away and refused to let
her. It seemed Chikane had finally managed to tick the little angel off. Now
how was she going to get out of this? She scratched her cheek, her serene
fa&ccedil;ade cracking like egg on a rock. She only wished she could lay hands on
Kannazuki AoiÅfs neck and strangle her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;Himeko turned around, tears still dripping off her
face, amazingly lovely even when sad. Noise rose around them in quiet murmurs.
People, standing in clusters, were whispering something into their respective
companionsÅf ears. The girl only wept harder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Realizing that it was not a good idea to let Himeko cry in
front of strangers, Chikane scooped the girl into her own arms and hurried out
of the theater. In the beginning, Himeko struggled desperately, crying while
demanding that she be put back on her feet. When the little angel learned that
Chikane was not going to do what she wanted, she settled with gripping the
front of ChikaneÅfs white blouse and continued weeping. Ignoring the people who
went wide-eyed at them on the way, Chikane walked faster.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>A while later, Himeko sat on a bench in an empty corner of
the park right in front of the movie theater, still crying her eyes out, and
brushed ChikaneÅfs hand off whenever Chikane tried to touch her. The girl never
acknowledged ChikaneÅfs heartfelt apologies, either. Now, Chikane was seriously
afraid. She had never thought it possible, but if she was not going to do
anything soon, she might just have to sleep in a different room tonight. After
two days of cuddling Himeko in her arms whenever they went to bed, she doubted
she could live through a night all on her own. </p>

had sat through those scary things for <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>her</span></i>
sake!Åh The little angel never raised her voice; she merely mumbled things to
herself while burying her face in her hands and wept. Yet, Chikane would have
felt a whole lot better had the golden-haired girl just shouted at her... or
snapped her head off. Chikane sighed and cursed herself for letting Kannazuki
AoiÅfs nasty habit getting the best of her. Chikane sighed again. She guessed
there was no other way. She stretched her arm backward as far as she could.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The first slap Chikane landed upon her own face made a storm
of fireflies erupted in her vision. The little angel stopped crying immediately
as she gave a violent start. The second slap, on the other cheek this time,
almost unhinged ChikaneÅfs jaw. Slowly, blood trickled out of her mouthÅfs
corner, and her face became so swollen that she thought any touch would burst
it like a needle would a bubble. Still, her hand rose once more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgShouldnÅft <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>I</span></i>
be the one to decide that?Åh the little angel said quietly after a moment,
amethyst eyes shining in the sunlight. Dimly, Chikane noticed that they were
not wet, but only very dimly. Regret, guilt, and shame were all but occupied
her heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

expression grew grim at the same time her voice turned hard. She looked...
dangerous. She looked... deadly. She looked... beautiful.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgWhy? YouÅfre hurt badly enough already,Åh Himeko said, both of
her gentle hands caressed ChikaneÅfs swollen cheeks with a painful expression on
her own face. Then she took out her handkerchief and tenderly cleaned the blood
off the corners of ChikaneÅfs lips. ÅgDonÅft hit yourself so hard ever again, ne.Åh</p>

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgYou are not angry any more?Åh Chikane took the little angelÅfs
hand into hers and pressed it against her cheek. Pain jolted, but was quickly
subdued and forgotten by the softness and silkiness of the girlÅfs touch.
Chikane could even feel her loverÅfs heart through the pulse, beating in a quiet
melody.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgYou....Åh So that was what it meant to <i><span

It was surprising though. She did not believe Kannazuki Akari herself had <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ever</span></i> considered the idea of
payback. Something had <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>definitely</span></i>
changed in the course of three thousand years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgServes you right, in any case,Åh Himeko said, sticking out
her tongue again. ÅgWho told you to toy with me?Åh Her expression turned a trifle
sad afterwards, however. ÅgI didnÅft expect you to slap yourself, though. IÅfm
sorry. It still hurts, doesnÅft it?Åh The little angelÅfs face drew closer, her
voice growing quieter, sweeter, and much more alluring.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgPoor you,Åh Himeko said and placed her soft lips upon
ChikaneÅfs swollen left cheek, then her right, and finally her lips. They kissed
over and over again, probably would not have stopped any time soon had they not
heard the sound of people approaching. It turned out to be a couple, who seemed
to be looking for a place to... perhaps share a few moments of intimacy. The
young man and the woman, well-matched and well-dressed, had arched their
eyebrows at Chikane and Himeko, who rose from the bench and walked away
giggling to each other. Treading along the streets of downtown hand-in-hand
with the little angel, Chikane silently vowed that she never again would tease
her sweetheart. Himeko forgave her this time but there was no telling whether
the girl would next time. The mere thought scared Chikane witless.</p>

study, quietly observed the Head Maid Kisaragi Otoha withdrawing, closing the
door behind her with a small click. KotoneÅfs lips curved into a little smile.
The woman was hysterical, although no one would know that unless they looked
into her eyes and discovered the gleeful gleam that appeared whenever she
succeeded in landing a subtle blow at Kurusugawa HimekoÅfs image with her
ill-willed stories, which the Head Maid claimed absolutely correct. By the time
the woman was done, ChikaneÅfs newfound lover had come out bearing a striking
resemblance to a blood-sucking leech, only much more shameless and clingy.
Otoha was good; Kotone had to give her that. She managed to splash a whole load
of mud onto Kurusugawa without dirtying herself, without even letting KotoneÅfs
Aunt and Uncle become aware of her <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>raging</span></i>

barely older than his daughter was when he became infatuated with a certain
someone. From the twinkle in her AuntÅfs eyes and the tightness around her

text-indent:.5in'>Himemiya Chikane, their beloved daughter, was in a white,
long-sleeved, and unbuttoned blouse worn over a shirt of the same color. On her
neck, there was a blue scarf one end of which hung down her front, keeping her
warm in the cold night of October. Instead of a long skirt, which was usually
the piece of clothing of her choice, she now donned a pair of casual, tight
blue denim jeans that showed all too clearly the shape of her thighs. With a
pair of sneakers adorning her feet, she looked like a boy, although she could
never have passed as one with her slender figure, her glossy stream of long
blue hair, her ample bosom, and her exceptionally beautiful face. Yet, if
Kimika was surprised at her daughterÅfs outfit, she was shocked by the childÅfs
whole-hearted laughter, loud enough to reach the second floor, where Kimika and
her husband stood. As far as they were concerned, Himemiya Chikane had <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>never</span></i> done that.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>Chikane, since her childhood, had always been a quiet girl
who rarely showed emotions. She might smile to Kyou and Kimika, she might
chuckle at a joke they told, but she never laughed. She was now, to a girl
hanging tightly on her arm, who wore the exact same outfit except for the red
scarf around her neck. Kurusugawa Himeko, Kimika guessed that was the girlÅfs
name, with her cute face and long golden hair, seemed to be glowing like the
stars up in the night sky while laughing along with KimikaÅfs beloved daughter.
Kimika gave her lips a thoughtful tap. No one could look at the two of them
without thinking that they were perfectly made for each other. In fact, they
complemented one another so well that they in their current clothes could
probably best Kimika and her Kyou-chan on their wedding day. Strange to think
that Kurusugawa Himeko matched their little princess better than any boy
would....</p>

Fuyura, the Chancellor serving under the Supreme Ruler of Reiha, would jump up
from the formerÅfs lap and fell on her back on the ground. After the young woman
had gotten back to her feet, with the help of a very concerned Izanami-sama,
she had stormed out of the Office, mumbling in a frustrated voice whether <i><span

sharing a moment of intimacy with her other Chancellor in there! Yue should
have known that something was very wrong when Tsukazaki Haruhi finished saying
that, for Yui had looked at the woman in a very quizzical way and started to giggle
softly as soon as Yue touched the doorÅfs handle. Had she stopped right there

daughter <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>cooked</span></i>
now. Their little ice princess &#8211; who had servants waiting at her beck and call,
who could not tell a frying pan from a soup pot &#8211; actually <i><span

the girl briefly mentioned in passing &#8211; she mainly talked about her lover &#8211;
Chikane spent two hours a day in the kitchen, learning how to make food from a
very <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>weary</span></i> chef.
She made a mess more often than not, which amused her no end for some reason,
but she had managed to fry eggs without making it seem like burnt-out coals
afterwards. She was really proud of that, and very happy, too, when her lover
told her that the dish tasted well. From what he could gather from the girlÅfs
story, Himemiya Chikane must have been beaming like a fool hearing the
compliment. Another disturbing image....</p>

girl bloody well tried to <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>seduce</span></i>
her! On the way back to her room alone, Himeko had unfortunately run into
Himemiya Kotone, who asked in a drop-dead serious manner whether she would like
to have a <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>private</span></i>
walk in the back garden and make themselves <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>comfortable,
</span></i>preferably without clothes. Chikane-chanÅfs cousin tended to let her
hands wander, too. Thrice she had tried to touch Himeko in <i><span

not practically pushed the girl off of her and run back to her room, something
really <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>bad</span></i> would
have happened, and being touched would have been the least of it. Himeko told
her sweetheart as much.</p>

extremely uncomfortable experience. She had looked forward to talking to
Kurusugawa Himeko, her daughterÅfs girlfriend, so much that the moment the two
girls entered the dining hall, she had immediately asked that Himeko be seated
at her side at the table. Both Chikane and Himeko had given a small start right
after she finished saying that. She really could not tell what had startled
them more, the unusual request, or the eagerness of her voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Of course, the golden-haired girl could not refuse &#8211; she
clearly wished she could, judging by the reluctant expression on her face&#8211; so
she meekly settled herself upon the high-backed chair next to KimikaÅfs.
Kurusugawa Himeko, in a red velvet dress baring her slender shoulders, with a
ruby pendant adorning her neck, was definitely prettier than most girls her
age. Some would even call her beautiful, although in a very different way from
KimikaÅfs daughter, she supposed. Others might be enthralled by ChikaneÅfs cool
and gorgeous appearance but Kimika knew that most of them were terribly afraid
of the girlÅfs unnerving sapphire gaze, which seemed more than capable of
punching holes through a granite wall. Kurusugawa Himeko, on the other hand,
looked so adorable that people just wanted to pull her into a hug.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Kimika almost scratched her head in puzzlement. Why in
HeavenÅfs name could the Head Maid Kisaragi Otoha have borne such a grudge
against such a cute little girl? Even now, the young woman, standing behind
Himemiya KyouÅfs chair at the head of the table along with other maids, were <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>still</span></i> throwing pointed
looks at the golden-haired girl as though they were sworn enemies. When Kimika
listened to OtohaÅfs stories about how much of a freeloader and a vermin Himeko
was, she already had an inkling not even twenty percent of them was truth. Now,
she doubted <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>any</span></i> of
them was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Well, Kimika being uncomfortable had nothing to do with the
Head MaidÅfs hostile mood, however. In fact, if Otoha snatched one of the silver
knives on the table and started to go after HimekoÅfs life, she still would not
be able to unsettle Kimika more than the gloomy gaze her daughter &#8211; in the same
outfit as that of her girlfriend, only with the color blue &#8211; was sending her
from across the table. The blue-haired girlÅfs expression strangely resembled
that of her husband a few years back when he had to go see the dentist due to
teeth problem &#8211; which he dreaded every step of the way. No doubt Chikane wished
to be the one in KimikaÅfs seat, next to her girlfriend. In the beginning, she
had tried to sit next to Himeko, on the same side of the table as Kimika of
course, but she failed, for Kyou told her that he wanted her next to him so
they could talk. For some reason, the little princess directed all her
irritation at Kimika instead of her Father, which made absolutely no sense.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Realizing that twenty minutes had passed in dead silence,
with Chikane trying to murder her filet mignon with fork and knife while
everyone else chewing theirs tastelessly, Kimika decided to speak. After all,
that was what she came here to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgI think heÅfs great... um... Himemiya-san,Åh Kurusugawa Himeko
answered timidly. Her compliment was certainly at odds with the food on her
dish, which she barely touched at all. Kimika would not blame her, though. Any
other girl in her place would not have much of an appetite either when sitting
at the same table with the parents of the one she loved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgJust <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Kimika</span></i>
is fine, child,Åh Kimika said. Somewhere in the background, she heard the sound
of a china dish crashing into the tiled floor. Turning her head, Kimika saw a
mess of broken shards and food near the Head MaidÅfs feet, showing her exactly
who it was that dropped the thing. It seemed Otoha was handling &#8211; well, trying
to handle &#8211; a dish when Kimika asked Himeko to address her by her first name.
Perhaps the young woman never expected her Mistress to permit such intimacy
from someone whose image she tried her best to smear earlier in the afternoon.
Perhaps.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Kisaragi Otoha was not the only one surprised. Chikane was,
too, before she managed to mask the shock. KimikaÅfs husband, well... he merely
smiled. The man saw it coming and certainly had no qualm about demonstrating
his knowledge. In fact, he had always claimed that he could predict whatever
Kimika was about to do. Well, he would be surprised.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

of absolutely no sounds. ÅgIf you wish to call me <i><span style='font-family:

either.Åh Another dish crashed. Otoha looked sickened to the core. Chikane and
her Father were so stunned that they failed to notice the knives and the forks
had dropped from their hands onto the table. Kimika rewarded herself with a
satisfied grin.</p>

hand against her forehead for dramatic effect. ÅgYou must forgive me, Himeko.
Sometimes I fall under the illusion that time still has mercy on me.Åh Too bad
her acting skill was not so good that she could cry anytime she wanted. A
glance out of her eyesÅf corners showed her husband hiding his mouth in his wine
glass, his shoulder trembling slightly in mirth. Chikane, on the other hand,
was looking mightily anxious, probably worried to death. Yes, no wonder they
said that a woman in love was as good as blind.</p>

her awkwardly. Kimika bet Himeko had never encountered any parent like her.
Well, even her beloved Kyou-chan sometimes accused her of acting more like
ChikaneÅfs friend than her mother. It was a severe case of a pot calling a
kettle black, seriously. He was the one to talk when he melted like a candle
under a flame every time he hugged the kid.</p>

sounded perfectly honest and heartfelt. For the first time after so many years

preparation for the confrontation with Kyou tomorrow. She chuckled. No, she
would not let that happen. In fact, she was going to make Chikane spend the night
with her under the obvious pretense of Ågwanting to catch upÅh. If Himeko was

of the finest Oolong tea brought straight from China, though. Young people

detail that Kurusugawa Himeko had labored two months in a local restaurant to
make enough money to buy Chikane the sapphire ring she now wore on her ring
finger. Even though KyouÅfs daughter could have bought <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>a dozen of them</span></i> with the
allowance provided each <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>week</span></i>,
she treasured the present more than anything her parents could give. <i><span

comprehend the love two girls may share with one another. It is harsh,
discriminating, and homophobic, especially in the business aspect.Åh He looked
straight at the young girl in the eyes, making sure his words were driven home.
ÅgLet us take Himemiya International for an example. True, the Himemiya Clan
founded the company, yet a large portion of the power rests in the hands of the
investors, represented by the Board of Executives. Imagine what would happen
should I tell those crippled, old-fashioned, ancient men and women that the
future C.E.O. of the company has a girl for her lover? They would withdraw
their investments on the spot, causing the immediate collapse of Himemiya
International and spelling doom for ChikaneÅfs future. That is why if you
sincerely love her, leave her for her own good.Åh</p>

quietly, both of her hands on her heart. Her expression became distant as the

impression that should he somehow manage to eliminate Kurusugawa Himeko, his
daughter would not survive the girl a week, if not <i><span style='font-family:

was going to pay for my education, too, that I could go as far as I wanted.
HeÅfs very nice, isnÅft he?Åh</p>

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgWell, I expect him to do so anyway, but yes, it was very
nice of him to offer you that.Åh Chikane smiled. ÅgWhat else?Åh</p>

text-indent:.5in'>The golden-haired girl blushed hotly. ÅgHe said... he was
going to throw a Christmas party in Mahoroba this year,Åh she murmured again. ÅgHis
friends would come, and he would introduce me to them... as your fianc&eacute;e. He
seemed... to be looking forward to surprising them. He scared me a little bit
when he talked about wanting to see the look on his friendsÅf faces, though.Åh</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgHe said so?Åh Chikane said quietly, her whole body growing
hot. ÅgWait, fianc&eacute;e? Does that mean....Åh She suddenly felt suffocated by the
revelation.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgYeah.Åh Himeko wrapped an arm around ChikaneÅfs waist and
hugged her more tightly. ÅgHe said he would arrange a wedding for us once we
graduated from high school.Åh The angelÅfs voice dropped to a whisper as her face
drew slowly toward ChikaneÅfs. They kissed.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgI told him last night that I would like to marry you,Åh
Chikane said breathlessly once Himeko had released her lips from the sweet and
passionate kiss. ÅgBut I did not imagine that he would grant my wish so easily.Åh</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgYou told him... last night?Åh Himeko said quietly. ÅgWhy
didnÅft you mention it?Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgBecause I was waiting for something else, Himeko.Åh Chikane
chuckled softly after she had placed a quick peck on the little angelÅfs
forehead. </p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Chikane withdrew her arm, which made a regretful sigh escape
HimekoÅfs lips, and reached her hand into her coat pocket.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgThis.Åh When she took her hand out, she was holding a pair of
simple gold bands, one carved with her own name in a flourished hand on the
surface and the other, with HimekoÅfs. The angelÅfs breath caught. ÅgI sneaked
away from Mother and Kotone today when we visited a large shopping mall just so
I could go into a jewelry shop and got them for you.Åh She stepped down from the
bed, got down on one knee, and looked up at the love of her life, sitting at
the edge of the mattress. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgWill you marry me?Åh she whispered as she took HimekoÅfs hand
into one of hers, the other holding the gold band carved with the golden-haired
girlÅfs name. ChikaneÅfs sweetheart went red in the face but at the same time,
her expression grew affectionate enough to make ChikaneÅfs heart skip a beat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgDo you have to ask?Åh the little anger whispered back, her
voice sounding warmer than fire, sweeter than honey. ÅgYes.Åh She pulled Chikane
back onto the bed once Chikane had slipped the band around her ring finger on
her left hand. There, the little angel cuddled her lightly and gave her kisses
that curled her every toe and heated up her blood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgDo you not think you should reward me more than that?Åh
Chikane whispered into the angelÅfs ear afterwards, hands caressing her cheeks.
ÅgThese bands cost a small fortune.Åh The golden-haired girl blushed even redder than
the sun that was sinking into the faraway horizon. Still, her hands settled on
the buttons of ChikaneÅfs white blouse as her body drew even closer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>It turned out that Chikane was unable to claim her reward
right at that moment, for her Father was knocking on the door, calling,
ÅgHimeko, Kimika would like to see you. She said she bought a lot of clothes for
you, child.Åh </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

scrambling away from ChikaneÅfs embrace to her feet.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

pleased. Slowly, his footsteps faded into the distance.</p>

to be called <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Himemiya-san</span></i>
by his future daughter-in-law, and that he wanted a nickname like the one I
gave your mom, so....Åh</p>

chuckled. ÅgFirst you called my Mother Kimika-chan, now my Father Kyou-chan. I

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

those few her lover had managed to undo prior to her FatherÅfs <i><span

ÅgThe more they love you, the happier I am.Åh She smiled at the little angel.
ÅgBut shall we go? LetÅfs see what my Mother got for you.Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>They walked out of the room, arm in arm, both could not seem
to stop smiling. There was another year until graduation, another three hundred
and sixty-five days until Himeko officially became a part of the family, but
waiting anxiously during that time made the prize all the sweeter to have, of
course.</p>
