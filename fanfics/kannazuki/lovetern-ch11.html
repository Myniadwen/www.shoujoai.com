text-indent:.5in'>Sitting comfortably in a high-backed and cushioned chair, Ame
no Minaka stroked his long white beard while gazing at a holographic screen
hovering a few inches above his large desk. He was currently in his spacious
office in the Heavenly Palace, every wall of which was decorated with paintings
by the best artists Izumo had ever produced, the ground on which he walk was
covered with the most expensive carpet that money could buy. Lining long the
wall were stone pedestals on which crystal vases or other artifacts imported
from the Citadel itself stood in all of their glories and further affirmed to
whoever chanced upon this place that its owner was a man with great taste. He
chuckled. He could still remember the faces of his colleagues in the Assembly,
who were invited to his office, when they laid their eyes upon his precious
collection. The gleam of greed and envy in their eyes had never failed to make his
day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Ame no Minaka took a sip from his teacup, the content of
which was brewed with the finest leaves and by the finest hands, and idly
leaned his back against the comfortable chair. His gaze once more fell on the
holographic screen that was showing the complete map of the Holy City. A smile
of satisfaction crossed his lips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Izumo, surrounded by forests and mountain ranges, was shaped
like a great disc spanning at least a hundred miles in radius and housed four
million Immortals in total, many of them immigrants from the Citadel itself.
Their very safety was ensured by the great Dimensional Boundary, an invisible
layer that enclosed the dimensional space in which the Holy City existed, that
had ripped apart countless fools who had the illusion that their feeble powers
could grant them entry into the World of the Gods. What they hoped to gain was
immortality and boundless honor. What they received was instant death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>In addition to the Dimensional Boundary, Izumo also had an
army of eight thousand powerful soldiers, armed to their toenails and
absolutely capable of wiping out any enemy Heaven might have. That very army
was then split into two divisions, called the Imperial First and Second
Battalions, headed respectively by HeavenÅfs two High Commanders, Kagutsuchi the
God of Fire and Susanou no Mikoto the God of Storms. The First BattalionÅfs
headquarters were located on the West side of Izumo, the SecondÅfs on the East,
both well beyond the circular wall that surrounded the city. Their duty was to
protect the peace of Heaven... or <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>so</span></i>
the recruitment flyers for the army always claimed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Yeah right,
</span></i>Ame no Minaka thought and laughed. He knew as well as anyone who
lived in Heaven that the Army was established because the Lord of Izumo wanted
to have a weapon to squash anybody who thought that they could wrestle the
Heaven Throne away from him by force. That was the sole reason why the man
appointed his two sons to the posts of High Commander while the only thing
Kagutsuchi was skilled at was dueling one-on-one and Susanou no Mikoto already
had his duty as the Keeper of the Hall of Memories to deal with. One of the
BattalionsÅf main functions was to serve as a reminder to the Celestial
Assembly. What Izanagi meant to tell them was that he had a powerful force at
his disposal, a monster ready to unleash anytime he wanted, and that unless
they wished to be crushed, they should tend their duties well and never have
any thought of rebellion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Ame no Minaka had to give the Ruler of Heaven a mental bow.
Without the Army at his beck and call, he would have faced at least a few
uprisings during the last three thousand years. The man was more aware than
anyone else how his iron-fist reign and his inflexible policies did not sit too
well with the majority of the public. Had there been a system that allowed the
Immortals to choose their own ruler, the Lord of Izumo would have been
dethroned and executed long since.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>In addition to being a jerk and a tyrant, Izanagi was also a
formidable strategist. Despite having an army that was headed by his sons, who
outwardly appeared to be very loyal to their father, the man never lowered his
guard. The man realized that although his Battalions had helped keep the
Celestial Assembly in line, he might have just created something that was
equally dangerous. He became quite conscious of the fact that there was no
guarantee that the eight thousand soldiers he commissioned would not stage a
coup d'&eacute;tat and overthrow him. Apparently, it never occurred to the Lord of
Izumo that he could trust Susanou no Mikoto and Kagutsuchi. If he had, two
things would never have happened. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>First, Izanagi would never have charged a special unit in the
Holy Messenger Division to monitor the Gods of Storms and Fire. Some of his
colleagues sometimes wondered why the man had never sent his sons to the
Sanctum Core to be questioned if he was so concerned that the latter might
harbor some sort of secret scheme against him. Ame no Minaka knew the answer to
that question. Izanagi was fearful that if he requested the Celestial AssemblyÅfs
help in investigation Susanou no Mikoto and Kagutsuchi, they would be able to
figure out that the bond between the Army and the Ruler of Heaven was not as
concrete as they had thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Second, Izanagi would never have built the Kusanagi System.
Ame no Minaka then felt himself reeling to the Sanctum Core, where Susanou no
Mikoto had made an entrance yesterday to deliver a full report on the artillery
network consisting of twelve colossal steel obelisks that towered over Izumo as
well as inspired terror and absolute obedience upon its citizens.</p>

God of Storms, you may begin anytime you wish,Åh Ame no Minaka had intoned
shortly after the full chamber of the Assembly gave a warm welcome to the High
Commander of the Second Imperial Battalion. Technically, he and Susanou no
Mikoto were equals. In reality, the latter stood much higher in the hierarchy,
for he commanded a force to be reckoned with, for he was one of the key players
in this plan, and for he represented the Regent of the Underworld. That had
been why the Arbiters had been treating the young man with the respect due the
Lord of Izumo himself.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅgThank you,
Lord Arbiter,Åh replied Susanou no Mikoto with an incline of his head. Somewhere
above him, a womanÅfs faint sigh could be heard. Being the most handsome man in
the Three Worlds, his very presence in the Sanctum Core was actually a threat
to the sanity of its many female administrators... and some of its male ones.
ÅgAs you are aware, I am here today to inform you of the latest developments in
the plan you and the Regent of the Underworld had worked out,Åh he swept his
gaze across the cascading rows of seat. A great deal more sighs were produced.
ÅgThe first thing I need to speak about is the Kusanagi System and its relevance
to the operation that we will soon carry out.Åh</span></i></p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>The High
Commander took from his coat pocket a PDA, a few keys on which he then pressed.
A heartbeat later, a large holographic landscape that depicted the Holy City
itself appeared in the small clearing on the floor of the Grand Hall of the
Sky. The structures that caught their attention immediately, of course, were
twelve needle-shaped pillars that formed a large circle around the Heavenly
Palace, the very heart of Izumo.</span></i></p>

furthest heights of the Core, Ågare in reality the prototype to the Shinken
Swords in Shingetsu Grand Shrine. As such, they possess the power to produce
sacred lightning that can reduce even an Immortal to ashes. In addition, they can
also link with one another through the great metal ring that stands at their
bases. Once they are connected, they can trap the entire City in </span></i>a
force field<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'> that temporarily </span></i>suppresses
magical power<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>. My father
added this feature upon his return from the Underworld.Åh A few pairs of eyes
widened. A few surprised gasps rose. Among the Assembly, there were those who
never had a clue how fearsome those steel pillars were.</span></i></p>

Pillar after every name he uttered. ÅgMany people are under the impression that
each of the Pillars is manned separately. That, however, is false.Åh He pressed
on another key on his PDA, which in turned lit up the large building located at
the heart of the circle formed by the Kusanagi System. It was where the Sanctum
Core was located, Ame no Minaka realized at the first glance.</span></i></p>

left, you will arrive at the headquarters of the Messenger Division, where the
Kusanagi SystemÅfs mainframe is kept and regularly maintained.Åh</span></i></p>

More widened eyes. Ame no Minaka and the other two Arbiters simply narrowed
theirs at the holographic model. They had not known that the mainframe was but
a stoneÅfs throw away from where they worked. They had guessed that it was
hidden somewhere more secret and less... conspicuous. </span></i>It is right
under our nose all along!<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'> he
thought.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅgAs you
would expect, not only is the Kusanagi mainframe guarded by a great host of
Messengers, it is also kept safe electronically by an impenetrable Operating
System. The OS is designed to reject all commands unless provided with the
correct Activation Code, a sequence of numbers and characters known only to the
Ruler of Heaven and his most trusted aid, Yuusaku.Åh The High Commander paused
to take a breath then continued, ÅgAfter years of conducting researches on Kusanagi
in secret, I regret to announce that the System, coupled with the Imperial
Army, cannot be defeated by conventional means.Åh</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅgHow
about... unconventional means?Åh asked Kami no Mikoto, the only woman in the
Three Arbiters. Surprisingly enough, she had never been fazed by SusanouÅfs
handsome features. But then... rumor also had it that she had taken another
woman for a lover and hid her so well that even the Holy Messengers had not
been able to dig up where she was. Ame no Minaka suspected that the first thing
that his subordinate Arbiter was going to do with the laws was to abolish the
one that forbid same-gender union.</span></i></p>

on another key on the PDA lit up a second building in Izumo, Ågis where I hide

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgJust how long do you intend to watch me, Kagutsuchi-san?Åh Susanou
no Mikoto muttered darkly without bothering to stand up and face the God of
Fire. He remained in the high-backed armchair in front of the Terminal and
tried to focus on his daily tasks. For some reason, though, the chair in which
he lounged every time he worked in the Hall now offered as much comfort as a
three-legged stool. It did nothing to lighten his mood. ÅgI said I would not
tell you anything, and that is final.Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgThen IÅfll stay here until you do, Susanou,Åh his twin brother
answered with an annoying smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgDo whatever you wish, then,Åh he said before putting the
flame-haired man out of his mind and beginning to forward the memories files
that the Celestial Assembly had requested.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>For several minutes, only the sounds of the Kiokkai waves
crashing against the high platform on which Kagutsuchi stood echoed inside the
vast dimension of the Memories Hall. Oddly enough, they were not soothing as
they used to be. The more the silence stretched, the more Susanou felt
KagutsuchiÅfs eyes, crimson augers hotter than fire, boring into his back, and
the more annoyed he became. Meanwhile, the latter kept making the tiniest cough
every now and then as if to prove that he was still there and watching every
move Susanou made. He almost gnashed his teeth in fury as a result. Never once
in his life did he imagine that such a maddening sound could possibly exist.
Another few minutes passed before he finally decided that he was not going to
sit there and be made fun by his brother anymore.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgIs there not something you should do?Åh He stood up, pushed
the chair back, spun on his heel, and faced the God of Fire with all his furies.
His eyes could have been as hot as the great mane of flame that was the other
manÅfs hair. It did not matter which one of them was taller and had more
muscles. For Immortals, the amount of celestial power possessed was the key. In
that, he was just as gifted as his twin brother. ÅgFor instant, get on with your
own life?Åh he whispered in a dangerous voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgOh, whatÅfs this?Åh Kagutsuchi let out a great gust of
laughter that was full of genuine amusement. Susanou started to wonder how many
blows of fist it would take to make the other man close his mouth and leave. ÅgThe
God of Storms lost his cool just because I looked at him! How unusual, how
rare! And I havenÅft even started the taunts yet!Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgIf you think being my brother allows you to waltz into my office,
irritate me, and still get away unscathed, you are mistaken,Åh he declared, his
voice growing colder and colder. By the end of the sentence, it had the full
force of an arctic wind. ÅgLeave on your own now, or be carried away by medics
later.Åh Power began to rise in him like the strongest tides.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgOh, threats!Åh If anything, Kagutsuchi only seemed much more
amused by SusanouÅfs infuriated tone. ÅgIÅfm scared!Åh His laughter said he was
feeling nothing as such. ÅgI think IÅfm going to find her and hide behind her back
now.Åh His tone left no doubt as who whom he was referring to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅgLeave!Åh</span></i>
Susanou snapped. He was so angry that a fraction of his powers wormed trough
his restraints and shrouded the cerulean sky of the Hall of Memories with the
darkest clouds. The light was smothered in an instant. The ocean rose in
murderous waves, its surface mirroring his mood. Thunder roared to punctuate
the howling of the winds. White lightning jabbed madly downward from the dark
blanket covering the vast heavens. Rain fell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgCome now, Susanou.Åh The God of Fire laughed, seemingly
oblivious to the drastic change in the surrounding. Before the fierce wind
could reach him, they were driven away. Before the raindrops could touch him,
they were evaporated. Susanou ended up being the only one who was getting
soaked and chilled to the bone. The fact infuriated him even more. ÅgI was only
kidding you, you know.Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgI do not find you funny, Kagutsuchi-san,Åh Susanou said, his
hand gesturing at the cloud-ridden skies and withdrawing his powers. In but a
heartbeat, the winds died, the Kiokkai calmed, the thunder ceased, and the
cloud dispersed. The only evidence that could suggest that a storm had just
passed them by was the water left in his clothes and on his body, which he also
dried completely with a wave of his hand. Not that the departed storm had taken
his anger along, though. He was still mad enough to chew rocks.</p>

either.Åh He shot Susanou a knowing look.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Shocked by the response, he stared at his twin brother in
stark horror. The God of Fire was right. No matter how many times Susanou had
been teased by the other man before, he had not cared much. If anything, he only
thought those jokes bland, tasteless, childish, and sorely lacking in the way
of wits and subtlety. Yet, it could not be denied that Kagutsuchi had very
nearly driven him over the edge just a minute ago. <i><span style='font-family:

concerned, he was not getting any work done at all. Despite his desperate
effort to organize the memories files and forward them to the Sanctum Core for
the Celestial Assembly to process, he had spent his whole morning making
mistakes, trying to correct them, and ending up making new ones. Deciding in

in a hurricane in his head. He now knew why he had been feeling so... unsettled
since he first arrived in his office, why his heart had been pounding madly
inside his chest, and why he could not focus on the tasks at hand. Apparently
he had not done something that he did every single morning since the day he met

in his mind at the strangest time, that he was more than tempted to say her
name, savor it as though the sweetest fruit, and that his heart would not let
him be unless he made a Vision Spell just to look at her for a few seconds.
Before long, he came to the realization that he had fallen for her, impossible
as it might seem. Were his sisters or his twin brother to find out, they would
laugh their heads off. Not that he intended to let them, of course.</span></i></p>

for having made fun of her at every turn. Had she had the chance, he was
certain that she would have. At first, he had been taken aback when he first

to someone else. Still, she persevered and decided to put all her efforts in
making her wish reality, hoping that the one she loved would become hers
someday. For that purpose she abandoned humanity and joined forces with the
Dark God. For that she became an Orochi while knowing that she had just turned
every living man and woman against her. The sheer length that the girl would go

Susanou in endless waves as he realized that the other man had been watching

accursed Sealed Sword from the Enshrinement Chamber of Shingetsu. When the door
opened, he saw the Seventh Head, whose facial expression mirrored his voice,
whose eyes were deeply troubled, and whose right hand was clutching an
Elemental Blade that was not his. Where the Lightning Blade was straight, this
sword was crooked. While Raien had only one gem that acted as a separator
between the hilt and the blade, this one had seven that were arranged in the
shape of the famous constellation the Big Dipper. It was Hokuto the Star Blade,
the second most dangerous of the Swords. He gasped aloud and sprang to his
feet. ÅgWhere... where did you get <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>that
</span></i>from?!Åh</p>

on the table, and sat down in a slump before he answered bleakly, ÅgNowhere. I

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

to his knees, took the Sealed Sword into his hands, and examined it carefully.
As his powers probed the magical weapon that had inspired terror and awe upon
those who held it, his jaw dropped. There was something missing, something that
should have been there, and something the absence of which informed him that a
terrible event had come to pass. The Star Blade fell from his hands and landed
upon the table in a loud thud.</p>

happened in that case, Souma.Åh He swallowed painfully. ÅgTsubasa-kun is dead.Åh</p>

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgI... hate to break this to you, Souma, but it is the truth,Åh
Kazuki said grudgingly. ÅgThe fact that Hokuto appeared in front of you is the

weapon will reveal itself to the person whom its last master loves most.Åh He
took a deep breath. ÅgIÅfm sorry, kiddo.Åh</p>

in denial while tears spilled out from the wells of his eyes and thundered down
his cheeks. Shaking, he then took Hokuto into his arms and held it as though
his own baby. ÅgTsubasa-nii-san,Åh he called out in a heartbroken voice before he
let out a string of full-throated wails that were full of despair, agony,
guilt, and grief.</p>

crying his eyes out and the other unable to utter even a word of comfort.
Kazuki knew that although he himself had loved the boy as his blood brother, he
could never fill TsubasaÅfs position in SoumaÅfs heart. Much as the First Head of
the Orochi had changed, he would forever remain an angel to the Seventh, for it
was he who had cared for the boy and protected him during his darkest days.
That, Souma would always remember no matter what.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>Kazuki heaved a deep sigh and began to massage his temples.
It was no time for him to mourn for the death while the safety of six billion
of the living was at stake. Shameful and heartless as it was to admit, only
half of him was saddened by this turn of events. The other half... was more
than glad. Tsubasa was an Orochi to the core of his existence, someone who had
forsaken his humanity and embraced the darkness, and a man who wouldnÅft hesitate
in slaughtering every other man, woman, and child of the Human World. With him
out of the way, the Dark God had lost one of his most powerful Followers. With
the First Head dead, OnogoroÅfs chance of survival had significantly increased.
Furthermore, he could hardly say that the sudden demise of Tsubasa was
unexpected. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ItÅfs inevitable,</span></i>
he thought. After all, the Priestess of the Moon was there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Eventually, SoumaÅfs grief subsided. Now, the boy only stared
teary-eyed at the only thing that could remind him of his deceased brother, the
Sealed Sword in his embrace.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgIf you knew, you would tell me, IÅfm sure,Åh the boy mumbled
in his tattered tearful voice as he slowly rose to his feet. The trust Kazuki
sensed in those words became a knife of guilt that pierced his heart. He was
fully aware of the identity of the First HeadÅfs murderer, yet he did not dare
tell his little brother. Were he to, the whole truth would also come out. That
he did not desire... at least at the moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgBack to my room, nii-san,Åh the boy answered, barely able to
hold back a sob. ÅgI... want to be alone for a while.Åh He used his sleeve to dry
the tears on his face. Kazuki understood what his little brother meant. The boy
was planning to consume his grief for his blood brother in private, away from
the prying eyes of anyone else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

while the Orochi Seventh Head slowly turned around and prepared to leave. He,
however, shouted, <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅgWait!Åh</span></i>
the moment his eyes fell upon something that upturned his stomach.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgFine,Åh Souma muttered darkly and rolled up his sleeve. The
sight of what lay beneath the fabric of the denim shirt he was wearing struck
Kazuki like a slap across his face. On the skin of his brotherÅfs forearm were
countless of strange characters written in the darkest ink possible. He had
seen them before in the ancient scriptures preserved in the great library of the
Council of Priests, the headquarters of which were located in Tokyo.</p>

tapping too far into RaienÅfs powers, Souma.Åh Anger flared in him and quickly
subsided. He sighed and sat down in front of his kotatsu table again. There he
trembled. There he buried his face in his hands and felt cold sweat running
down his back. Upon looking up again after a while, he found the Seventh Head
of the Orochi sitting across the table, face anxious. ÅgWhy didnÅft you listen to

the aftermath of the first holy war between humanity and the Dark God, the
Council of Priests found eight piece of metals that could be found nowhere on
Earth. They were well nigh indestructible. They possessed incredible energy as
well as the power to replenish it. They thought that if they managed to harness
their powers, they would have a greater chance when the Dark God returned to
plague mankind. That was why they set out to forge them into what were now the
Sealed Swords.Åh</p>

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgI said <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>well
nigh</span></i> indestructible. To the Eyes of Heaven, they were little more
than clay,Åh Kazuki answered. ÅgThe Council of Priests had used the Twin Keys to
forge the Elemental Blades before they sealed the former in the Enshrinement
Chamber.Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

names of which were given according to the Element that each of them housed,Åh
Kazuki continued. ÅgOnce the Council had selected eight of their strongest
Priests, given the Swords to them, and asked them to test the extents of their
powers, they became amazed.Åh His voice turned grim. <i><span style='font-family:
"Footlight MT Light"'>With the Eyes and the Swords in our hand, we will never

were quickly disabused as their amazement turned into horror. They noticed that
the two Priests responsible for Raien and Hokuto were undergoing some drastic
changes.Åh</p>

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgBecause they had no choice, Souma,Åh Kazuki explained
patiently. ÅgHokuto and Raien had infused their wielders with so much evil and
darkness they became insane. They began to attack their friends, comrades, and
even their families. As a result, the other six Priests immediately used their
Elemental Blades to combat the berserk ones. Despite the formerÅfs desperate
effort to save their colleagues, the latter resisted so fiercely that when the
Lightning and the Star Blades were knocked out of their hands, they had
sustained mortal injuries. They died shortly afterwards. Their deaths were the
reason why the Council decided to lock up the Swords. Raien was Sealed next to
the Eyes of Heaven so that the EyesÅf holy powers could suppress it. Hokuto was
entrusted to the Onmyouji of the Sumeragi, the most powerful magisters in the
world.Åh His eyes riveted on SoumaÅfs in an attempt to drive his words home. ÅgBy
the way, the two Priests only went berserk <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>after</span></i>
the characters had shown up on their faces.Åh</p>

down to the ground, the air was simmering with so much heat it burned the
insides of KazukiÅfs nose, the earth was trembling slightly as though something

even startled Souma, who afterwards began to eye the three with respect. But of

no more. What was left were five Orochi Heads whose bodies simmered with the
power of the dark. Four of them were women whose ages ranged from around
eighteen to thirty, each and every one of them pretty enough to boil a manÅfs
blood. The final Follower Kazuki guessed to be a girl but couldnÅft be certain
since her slender frame was completely cloaked by a cape black as the night and
her face was obscured by a shadow that extended downward from her black hood.
He shivered. The sense of power that radiated from her was so strong that he

changed into the High Priest outfit that he always wore during every ceremony.

was what had been soaked in the holy aura of the Gods. It was the sacred armor

Head, a girl swathed in a black cape with a deep hood and a swirling shadow
that hid all but her emerald eyes, paid absolutely no attention to him. She
seemed to be lost in thoughts. He was almost tempted to launch a surprise
attack on her just so he could remove the most powerful of the surviving
Followers. He rejected the idea, however, when he figured out that the moment
he went for the girl in the black cape would be the one in which the other five

who had dressed scandalously the first time he saw her, now wore a simple
T-shirt and a pair of worn-out jeans. Her hair was messy, her eyes were also
swollen, and she kept glancing longingly at the Fifth Head. Even more
peculiarities. The wielder of Asayuki was no longer the icy woman that he

erected at the very heart of the Grand Shrine and expanded until it enveloped
the entire structure. Souma shivered. Although he was at least ten feet away
from the barrierÅfs edge, he could still feel its power pulsing like the
heartbeat of the world, ever trying to push him further away. ÅgThere are two

ripping across SoumaÅfs body. He knew that it was Kannazuki Aoi before he looked
up to the heavens and saw the blue-haired girl sitting cross-legged on a Moon
Crest with her chin propped atop her right hand. Her lips were curved upward in
a contemptuous smile. Her sapphire eyes were boring at his brotherÅfs face. She
made his blood boil. There was no doubt that she was the strongest of all the
people who were currently present. With her here, the future of this Shrine

there could be no better chance then when Kannazuki Aoi was distracted. In less
than a heartbeat, he dug his heels into the soft ground, lowered his body, and
leapt upward with the tip of Raien aimed straight for her throat. He changed
his mind when he was half-way to where she was, however, for a voice in the
back of his head reminded him that they needed her blood to summon Ame no
Murakumo. As a result, he swerved the Lightning Blade to his left so that his
target was now her right arm. If he managed to deprive her of a way to wield
KagetsukiÅfs full power, she would no longer be a threat.</p>

he thought and concentrated his mind on incapacitating the most dangerous foe
of the Human World. His blood froze the instant he saw that Kannazuki Aoi had
already turned her head to face him. Before his blade could touch her flesh,
her right sleeve rose upward in a white blur and brought Raien to an abrupt
halt. His jaw fell. The PriestessÅfs erected palm, a fraction of an inch away
from the SwordÅfs tip and wreathed in a protective layer of silver light, was
what had stopped the weapon from touching her. He had not known that she could
do that. The second shock came when he discovered that not just Raien, but his
entire body, had fallen under her control. He couldnÅft twitch even a muscle.
Horror rose in him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

Souma,Åh said the blue-haired girl, Ågbut the Second Head would not be pleased

yours, Girochi Miyako.Åh At the moment AoiÅfs final word was uttered, her hand
delivered a force great enough to level mountains along RaienÅfs blade and
hurled his body toward the ground, where the darkly tanned woman was waiting
with her eyes blazing with anger, her mouth snarling some unintelligible words,
and her hands clutching Rekkyou the Fire Blade.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>With a simple turn of his wrist, he managed to bring Raien in
front of him just in time to deflect Rekkyou. After a loud clashing sound
accompanied by a shower of flying sparks, Souma and Miyako, he believed that
was her name, stood on the ground and glared at each other with open animosity
on her part and a little bit on respect on his. According to the aftershock
that he had felt after he crossed sword with her, he knew that she possessed a
physical might that nearly matched his. He hadnÅft expected that from any
Follower aside from his now deceased Tsubasa-nii-san and the Eighth Head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'>Before he could think any further, the Second Head lunged at
him and brought her blade down his head. To his surprise, her strength kept on
rising after every sword stroke she dealt and after every single time he pushed
her back with Raien. Meanwhile, she never stopped snarling and screaming at him
as though she was insane. She made him feel queasy. A few minutes after their
fight was renewed, he began to think that perhaps the chance of him winning was
not so great.</p>

who was staring pointedly at the girl who called herself Kannazuki Aoi, who had
landed on her feet upon the ground after pitching the Seventh and the Second
Heads against each other. ÅgOr should I address you as Commander?Åh Upon learning
that Tsubasa the First Head had died of a sword wound near Shingetsu, the Dark
God had decided to promote the Priestess of the Moon to the post of Commander
of the Orochi. Of course, no one cared about that &#8211; Girochi Miyako was too
grief-stricken to even attend the audience while Korona and Oota Reiko were too
engrossed in pursuing their own thoughts that perhaps they didnÅft even know
what Yamata no Orochi was saying &#8211; except the cat-fanatic Nekoko, began to
mutter angrily under her breath as soon as she realized that her mortal enemy
was now her superior.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgYou and the Sixth Head will proceed to obliterate the barrier,Åh
Aoi said, her eyes following the ragged path that Oogami Souma and the
surviving Girochi were carving in the sky. As far as Makoto was concerned, the
former had been forced into total defense while being shocked by the latterÅfs
unrelenting attacks. Probably never in his wildest dream did he ever imagine
that a Follower other than his precious elder brother could give him so much
trouble in a melee combat. Not that Makoto was surprised. If the thirst for
revenge could turn the weakest and meekest person into a monster, it certainly
could grant the Second Head, who had lost all meanings to live in life, the
power to surpass that of the Seventh. ÅgWe cannot have it standing, can we?Åh the
blue-haired girl continued after a while. She then glanced and smiled at Oogami
Kazuki, who tightened his mouth in response. ÅgAnd since the High Priest will
surely get in your way, I will ask the Fourth and the Fifth to keep him
company.Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgVery considerate of you,Åh muttered the man. Makoto suspected
that the mangaka, who was glaring at her new Commander with a sour face and
tight lips, had wanted to say the same thing. The pop idol, on the other hand,
contented herself with simply gazing at her lover with teary eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

girl, who turned and walked away from Shingetsu Grand Shrine, the hem of her
hibakama and the long, wide sleeves of her chihaya trailing after her in the
winds. ÅgI will leave everything in your hand, Eighth Head.Åh A spark of silver
light appeared a few feet in front of her and elongated into a thin shaft which
then spun vertically about its center to form a silvery surface of a
Dimensional Portal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

stopped an inch in front of the Portal and glanced at her over the shoulder.
The girlÅfs face was very cold. ÅgFurthermore, my task lies elsewhere, as you
have already known.Åh With that, she proceeded to enter the silvery surface. As
soon as she disappeared, it thinned back into a vertical shaft of white light
and melted into nothingness.</p>

developed a taste for standing on top of the world, Makoto looked at the
cat-fanatic Nekoko and then tossed her head at the great dome of light
encompassing Shingetsu before she lifted her body high into the air.
Acknowledging the command with a grudging nod &#8211; Makoto doubted the Sixth Head
liked to take orders from anybody aside from her liege lord and maybe not even
him &#8211; the wielder of the Wind Blade followed her all the way to the very top of
the barrier. Oogami Kazuki tried to stop them but to no avail, for the Fourth
and Fifth Heads had already drawn their Swords and barred his path.</p>

Grand Shrine, she began to deploy her powers. First, a little sphere of pure
shadow small as a fingertip appeared at the tip of her right foot and grew
larger until it reached the size of a manÅfs hand. Space itself began to ripple
like the surface of a pond disturbed by a rock. At a snap of her finger, six
identical Tasogare emerged tips first from the sphere and revolved like the spokes
of a spinning wheel even when they were still drifting further and further away
from the center. The quicker they turned, the more the black sphere expanded,
and the more violently the dimensional fabrics flexed. When the sphere had
grown enough to be able to engulf her body, the Swords ceased their movements,
and space grew calm once more.</p>

Orochi, who were on the side of the great dome of protective light, weaving
massive tornadoes in the sky with Arashigumo the Wind Blade. Like gigantic
drills the funnel-shaped columns of howling winds and dust-ridden clouds
descended upon the barrier in an attempt to rip it apart. Smiling, she snapped
her fingers again and turned the great sphere of shadow into a pillar that
slammed upon the protective layer in a thunderous roar.</p>

entirely no effect on the barrier of Shingetsu. What she was doing, in fact,
was suppressing the Sixth Head power in secret and thus reducing her spellÅfs
effectiveness by a little more than ninety-nine percents. She doubted Nekoko
would ever imagine that her seemingly powerful tornadoes were simply sucking in
the dust from the protective barrier. This way, MakotoÅfs beloved Himeko would have
a little more time in drawing out the remaining Eye of Heaven. This way, she
could use it later to pierce Kannazuki AoiÅfs heart and summoned the Sword God
Ame no Murakumo.</p>

since the beginning of her employment in the Rosenkyuu, the girl was at least a
thousand years her junior, she had realized just now that it would be very
cruel and disrespectful to continue doing so to someone who had confessed her
love for her. Besides, it was not exactly appropriate anyway. Despite their age
difference, Izanami still looked young enough to be FuyuraÅfs elder sister when

slightly when their eyes met, and felt mildly surprised by how her perception
of the raven-haired girl had changed in such a short period of time. Before,
she saw the Chancellor as a girl, if an exceptionally pretty one, barely older
than her own daughter the Goddess of the Moon, a youngling she needed to
protect, and last but not least, a very effective employee. Now, she began to
view Fuyura as a grown woman who deserved more respect than what she had
treated her with before. Now, she started to notice what kind of clothes or
perfume her Chancellor wore to work everyday. Now, she paid more attention to
how the raven-haired girl talked, smiled, and even yelled at the people who
failed to do what she asked.</p>

a little even though she had thought in the beginning that she did not share
her daughterÅfs peculiar preference in women. She could not help but eventually

Yuusaku the Chief Messenger massaged his temples while wondering why he
couldnÅft remember a thing he did since he first stepped into the Heavenly
Palace. It was as though there was a gap in his memories. A blank spot on a
piece of paper that had words written everywhere else. It was unnatural, he
decided. Mortals might suffer from memory loss, but not Immortals, for their
bodies were immune against natural sicknesses. Now if only he could figure out
why this was happening to <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>him</span></i>

text-indent:.5in'>His final step brought him in front of a pair of steel doors
each engraved with a half of a pentacle inscribed in a circle. It was the
entrance to the headquarters of the Holy Messenger Division, Home of all spies.
Putting the thoughts of his sudden amnesia out of his head, he placed his palm
upon the blinking sensor plate on the right side of the doors and let it read
his Power ID. A second later, the tall steel slabs slid sideways into the walls
and revealed a vast chamber that could hold at least a thousand people at the
same time. As he walked inside, his eyes fell upon state-of-the-art computers
arranged in circles within circles the center of which was marked by a column
of crystal that spanned ten feet in radius. It was the user interface of the
pride of the Division. It was called the Divine Terminal, the means through
which the Messengers could communicate with IzumoÅfs oversight mechanism, the
Kusanagi Mainframe, also the most powerful computer in the Three Worlds.</p>

went back to what they were doing before he entered. Some continued making
phone calls, a few returned to hammering their keyboards and gluing their eyes
at their monitors, several walked around the room to converse in a low voice
with their colleagues, and a couple of them were snoring on their desks. He
knew the two men. They had been part of a team of Messengers that he sent to
Shingetsu yesterday to keep the Underworld spies from uncovering YukihitoÅfs
secret. When they came back to headquarters last night, they had been so
exhausted that they fell asleep right then and there.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>Yuusaku then walked to the heart of the room and began to
inspect the content of the Divine Terminal. Its base was a miniature real-time
holographic model of the Izumo, its length the entire IzumoÅfs airspace. Once he
was done and had decided that there were no abnormalities that he could see, he
turned and walked toward his private office at the far side of the great
chamber. Before he could make a second step, all the alarms suddenly went off
and startled him so violently he almost tripped on the hem of his own cape and
fell. Spinning on his heel, he focused his attention back upon the Divine
Terminal, in which he spotted something that left him flabbergasted.</p>

storm clouds from which lightning flared and thunder roared every few seconds.
Even without the MessengerÅfs announcement, he could still see that the
dimensional structure was being ripped to shred and the Boundary that separated
Izumo from the other two Worlds being destroyed. <i><span style='font-family:
"Footlight MT Light"'>Who the hell has the power to do this?</span></i> he
thought in horror. The only thing that answered his question was a faint tremor
in the ground and in the air, which was followed by a flash of white light that
filled the entire chamber with its brilliance. Being the person closest to the
crystal cylinder, Yuusaku thought that he would go blind.</p>

of light, each bearing a different color, come out of the lowest layer of storm
clouds. In a blink of the eye, those beams struck the deserted outskirt of the
Holy City and shockwaves after shockwaves ripping across the surface of Izumo.
The resulting upheavals were so violent that quite a few Messengers ended up on
their fronts or backs on the ground. Yuusaku himself would have shared the same
fate had he not lifted himself up into the air in time to escape the tremors.</p>

had happened, he saw that the cerulean sky had reopened. White clouds once
again surfed the endless cerulean that had been presiding over Izumo since the
beginning of the ages. What had changed, however, was the existence of five
gigantic craters, ugly scars that the light beams earlier had left upon the CityÅfs
outskirt. Higher floated five structures, all of which seemed to be carved out
of gemstones, that resembled pyramids glued together at their base. And most
shocking of all, an upside-down city was lying at the very top of the Divine
Terminal. There was only one city in the Three Worlds that had a building built
in the shape of a rose in its center. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>The

from the depth of the Memories Sea earlier to prepare for Operation Providence
Breaker. The massive obelisk was nothing but a prison, yet it contained within
itself something that was vital for what he was about to do. During the last
three thousand years, he had used the budget from the Celestial Assembly to
build in secret a computer that rivaled the Kusanagi Mainframe in term of

he said with a smile. Behind him, the God of Fire let out a guttural laughter
that reverberated endlessly in the Memories Hall. Earlier in the morning, the
Celestial Assembly had summoned Yuusaku the Chief Messenger to the Sanctum
Core. There, they used the mind-reading power that the structure had gifted
them with to pull out the password to the Kusanagi System. There was no other
way to obtain it, for the Lord of Izumo had cast such a spell on his most
trusted aid that the password that only the two of them knew would not even
appear in the latterÅfs memories in the Kiokkai. Once it was over, the Arbiters
had erased YuusakuÅfs memories just as they did the Messengers who followed
Susanou and Kagutsuchi every day. That had been why the Division never realized
that he and his twin brother had been hatching a rebellion during the last three
millennia.</p>

aided by a fearsome Sealed Sword, it would only take her less than five minutes
to overwhelm Oogami Kazuki and destroy him. She was wrong. The man deflected
every spell she hurled at him, blocked her every sword stroke, and several

Reiko doubted that the pop idol could, in any case. The Earth Blade, being a
low-speed weapon, required time and concentration to release its fearsome might.

as she turned her head and looked at Korona, whose eyes were trying to jump out
of their sockets, whose mouth was opened wide like that of a fish caught out of
water, whose body was thrashing violently even though her arms and legs were
caught in the menÅfs arms. The sight ripped ReikoÅfs soul into pieces. ÅgI
surrender,Åh she said in resignation and let go of the Sealed Sword in her hand.
Freed, Asayuki plunged into the soft ground until all that was visible above
the surface was it hand guard and hilt.</p>

hand then extended and buried its tip in her heart. She could only let out a
wordless scream before its power seared into her skin, invaded every corner of
her body, locked away her powers, and ultimately pulled her down onto her
knees. She knew that she had been sealed. Now, she was just a normal woman who
was unable to wield her own Sealed Sword. Everything was over. ÅgStop,Åh the man
raised his voice at his three subordinates, who immediately ceased their
attempt to murder Korona. He then walked to them, used his sword to seal the
Fourth HeadÅfs powers the way he did hers, before he commanded them to release
her.</p>

on the ground, put her hands around her throat, and began to choke painfully
while gasping for breath. After a while, Reiko rose to her feet, crossed the
distance, and knelt back down by the girlÅfs side. There, she trembled. There,
she sensed her heart ache.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgAre you alright, Reiko?Åh asked Korona, who gazed up at her
with a pair of emerald eyes filled with concern. ÅgDid he hurt you anywhere?Åh
Those words, simple but heartfelt, moved her so greatly tears started trickling
down her face. Despite being wounded badly by the Priests, the first thing
other woman had asked after was ReikoÅfs wellbeing instead of her own. Natsune
had been the only person in this lonely world who cared for her with such
devotion.</p>

voice before she pulled the Fourth Head into her arms and claimed her lips. The
latter stiffened in shock for a few heartbeats before she put her arms around
ReikoÅfs back and returned the kiss with all her heart and soul. She could feel
warmth and love pouring into her. She could hear the sound of the eternal wall
of ice she built around her heart crumbling into pieces. As their mouth
eventually broke apart, her hand rose to touch the girlÅfs throat and caressed
it in the hope that it could ease her pain. ÅgMy precious Korona,Åh she cried
softly. Since she chased the girl out of her room the day before, her heart had
been hurting so badly she only wished she could rip it out and crush it.</p>

first love. She realized that she had betrayed the promise she had given
Natsune. She knew she was not worthy of forgiveness. If there was indeed a
fiery hell, she would definitely go there after she died and suffer for time
eternal. Yet, right now she did not care. Now, she had in her arms the girl she
loved, who loved her more than she loved herself. There was nothing else she
could wish for. There was nothing else she possibly wanted. She did not need
immortality. She no longer wished to carry out her vengeance upon the world.
All she desired right now... was a happy life that she could spend by the side
of the one she loved.</p>

that shot from above his head. Up there, Girochi Miyako was still snarling and
continuing to throw vicious spells after vicious spells at him. Judging by the
way the woman had been doing that for the last thirty minutes without stopping,
she seemed to have an endless supply of magical energy. He found himself
wishing that he also had one. If he did, he would not have to conserve his
power and run from her fierce assaults even though he knew he was stronger than
her. He only wondered how much longer it was going to take before she was
exhausted.</p>

swung Raien around to block Rekkyou. The resultant impact was so great that it
rocked his arm and sent his body diving toward the earth. Only when he was a
few feet from cracking his head upon the ground did he regain his balance and
stop his neck-breaking descent. Before he could heave a sigh of relief, he saw
the darkly tanned woman rushing at him again from above, her sword wreathed in
fire.</p>

brought it down upon the ground beneath his feet. At the moment of contact, the
ground exploded and provided him with a force strong enough to hurl him upward
as fast as the Orochi woman had sent him rushing down. As he stationed himself
in the air afterwards, he saw her standing between two smoking craters of equal
size of different depth. The shallower of them was made by Raien, the deeper,
Rekkyou.</p>

They then gathered into her palm and solidified into a Sword the blade of which
was as shiny as any mirror. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>The
Water Blade!</span></i> he thought. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>SheÅfs

abandoned him as he felt shock ripple along his nerves. He did not know that a
Follower could wield two Swords at the same time. Before he could overcome his

seeking to cut him into pieces.</p>

at him in successive waves. Seeing how they had blocked all his escape routes,
he decided to take them head on instead of dodging them. As his powers streamed
into the Lightning Blade, a spherical barrier woven from purple lightning
sprang up around him. At first, when he saw that the fire and water blades easily
bounced off the protective layer, he told himself that he had made the right
choice. A second later, when the Orochi Second Head descended upon him and
ground the tips of her Blades upon his barrier, he knew that he had made a
terrible mistake. By deciding not to evade, he had turned himself into an
unmoving target for the darkly tanned woman.</p>

When it faded away, Souma was lying on his back with Lightning Blade in his
right hand and the Star Blade in his left. The Orochi Second Head, who seemed
to have been hurled away by the force released at the emergence of Hokuto, was
lying on her front a dozen feet away and screaming with her hands over her
eyes. On either of her sides were Suikyou and Rekkyou, the blades of which were
reflecting the shadows of the silver moon and the Dark Sun.</p>

another in an eerie melody and send waves of fierce and sinister thoughts
washing over him. His throat ran dry, his body grew hot, and his vision was
dyed with a color too close to that of blood for his comfort. On his face,
something was crawling and searing into him. Somewhere at the back of his head,
a voice was raving in what seemed to be a chant of death and destruction. It
was then that he remembered what the High Priest had told him about how the
previous wielders of Hokuto and Raien had died.</p>

overhead. He could sense power surging inside them. He knew that in but an
instant, they were going to destroy everything that he held dear.<i><span

layer, and whose face was so breathtakingly beautiful that she would make the

stood, his hands holding Hokuto and Raien, his face colder than a block of ice.
From the blades of the Two Swords blood were dripping. Next to the boyÅfs feet
lay the limp body of the woman who was the Orochi Second Head. On her chest
there were two wounds, from which blood were gushing out in nozzles. In her
hands were Rekkyou and Suikyou, yet they could no longer be wielded by their

when compared to hers, and a traitor she could destroy anytime she wished. He
was no longer so. Now, with the Lightning and Star Blades in his possession,
Oogami Souma was as powerful as she was, if not more.</p>

Ototachibana Academy to lay eyes on him this very moment, they would scream in

possible between her and the barrier of Shingetsu Grand Shrine. Although the
cat-fanatic Nekoko did not seem to understand anything the way her face was

Each had four limbs, each tipped with claws large enough to wrap around a thick

thinned into a straight line. She was well aware of how strong these two

energy. The dragonsÅf power output was so large that the resulting shockwaves,
which were formed at the moment of collision, destroyed the Nekoko the Sixth

the ground and was knocked unconscious. Makoto grimaced. Had she not braced

Finally, when it could shrink no more, it shattered in the dying cries of three
hundred fifty people who had risked their lives to sustain it. Shuddering,
Makoto thought of what Oogami Souma would command the dragons to do next.
Although she was determined to protect Himeko, she was not entirely sure she
could stand up against Hokuto no Ryuu and Raien no Ryuu at the same time. Powerful
as Tasogare might be, its true form still wouldnÅft be able to defeat two of its
brethren. Should she try, all she was going to gain would be instant defeat.</p>

had to ward off the attacks thrown at her by the Second and the Sixth Head.

beat strongly once more. The other three men, whose name Makoto didnÅft know,

sprung up and engulfed him. In it, he was bellowing in great anger and pain,
his hands were clawing at the inner wall of the pillar in a futile attempt to
tear it up, and the dark presence within him was slowly being expelled. The

upward at the heavens dominated by the silver moon, the golden sun, and the
Dark Sun, from which shadow was spilling out like water from an open tap. Not
even a full minute had passed before the shadow swallowed up the Dark Sun and
solidified into a monstrosity the size of which dwarfed that of both the
Lightning and Star Dragons combined. It was also a dragon with massive
serpentine body, a mane, a pair of gigantic wings, and two sets of limbs. Yet,
instead of solid light, this creature was made of flesh. Instead of having only
one head the way the other Elemental Dragons did, this one had eight. Makoto
could see the light go dim at Yamata no OrochiÅfs appearance. She could feel the
wind quiet down and the air grew heavy under the endless waves of power
radiating from the Dark GodÅfs legendary form. She could hear the rumbling
growls coming out of the toothy mouths of the Lord of all Followers. She could
sense fear tearing herself apart. Susanou no Mikoto was the strongest Immortal

Winds howled, the ground shook, and space trembled under the force that the

whispered before she swerved Kagetsuki to the right and buried its tip in

only drew a sharp breath and bit on her underlip to prevent any cry from
escaping. Blood trickled out from a corner of her mouth.</p>

hand, wrapped it around the blade of the Eye of Luna, pulled it out of her
flesh, then positioned it so that it aimed at her left chest. When she withdrew
her hand, it was bleeding. She paid it as much mind as the deep wound on her
left arm. ÅgIf you truly hated me, you could just pierce my heart.Åh The
confidence note in her unyielding voice announced that she doubted such a thing
was going to happen. Words died in AoiÅfs throat. She had not imagined that this
was how their reunion was going to be. She had thought that after what she had
done to the Priestess of the Sun, the latter would do all she could to destroy
her and use her blood to summon the Sword God.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Aoi took a few steps backward. When she raised the Eye of
Luna once more, its target was no longer the golden-haired girl. What she was
directing it at now... was the earth riding above the horizon. Power rose in
her and filled her with its sweet and overwhelming sensation. Silver light
poured out of Kagetsuki so fast that in no time at all, it formed a humongous
orb of light hovering at the tip of the sword. The little angel widened her
eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

on the orb. Like an arrow loosed from a bow, it rushed toward the Earth.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgNo!Åh shouted the Priestess of the Sun. In but a heartbeat,
she summoned the Eye of Aurora into her hand, unsheathed it, and traversed the
impossible distance, and appeared in the path of the spell Aoi just cast. She
slammed the edge of Akatsuya at the side of the silver orb. After a deafening
explosion and a storm of golden light, it changed direction, shot into the
depth of space, and vanished. Afterwards, the golden-haired girl fell on her
back on the ground, where she began to cough up blood. The Eye of Heaven, which
had left her hand at the moment of explosion, now stood with its blade halfway
into the ground a few feet away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

destroying the Grand Shrine. She never expected the golden-haired girl to jump
into harmÅfs way like that.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgAkatsuya...Åh the little angel called weakly, her bloodied
hand extending toward her weapon. At her call, the Eye of Aurora lifted itself
from the ground, flew toward her, and gently put its hilt into her grip. Then
it shapeshift into Arashigumo the Wind Blade and spread its emerald light upon
her body. Once the healing process had concluded, Akari grounded Akatsuya onto
the ground again to help herself stand up. Aoi was aware that although all of
the other girlÅfs wounds had been healed, the painful sensations still lingered,
and the huge amount of power she had spent deflecting the silver orb could not
be replaced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgWhat you have just done is useless,Åh Aoi pointed out. Her
sword rose one more time to direct the flows of her power. A second orb of
silver light just as large as the first appeared. ÅgAll that it managed to
accomplish was weakening you. You cannot make it this time.Åh Her voice
hardened. ÅgPray for all the people who are going to die for your mistake,
Akari.Åh Horror crept across the golden-haired girlÅfs beautiful face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅgStop it!Åh</span></i>
she yelled. As soon as the last word left her mouth, red light as bright as
that of noonday blazed from the little finger of her left hand and filled the
world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Shocked, Aoi hastily cover her eyes with her left sleeve and
was driven backward step after step by waves of power pulsating off from where
the Priestess of the Sun was standing. When the light had faded away and she
had lowered her arm, she saw a thin red ribbon, within which the golden-haired
girl stood, spiraling upward into the starlit night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

with such a weapon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The red ribbon uncoiled and whipped at Aoi so quickly that
she never had time to defend herself. Enishi, or whatever its name was, wound
itself around her, knocked the Eye of Luna away, and tied her into a sack. The
strangest thing was that the moment it touched her was also the moment it sent
a flow of lava-hot emotion sweeping across her body. However, she did not panic
even after she had been taken by surprise. Instead, she invoked every ounce of
her celestial power in an attempt to rip the red ribbon into pieces. To her
horror, the silver light that continuously flared up from her body inflicted as
much damage to Enishi as a fly would upon a rock. This time, panic swallowed
her whole, destroyed her balance, and pulled her down onto her knees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgIÅfm... sorry, Chikane-chan,Åh murmured Kannazuki Akari, who
was kneeling beside her. It was then did she realize that one end of the ribbon
was tied to the girlÅfs little finger. It was then did she notice that the
latter was sending a golden glow along the flimsy length of the former. It took
her less than a second to know where that glow was headed. She gasped aloud in
shock when the power of the Priestess of the Sun arrived at the Moon Crest on
her back and proceeded to seep into her flesh. An instant later, she was
sealed. In another flash of red light, the red ribbon vanished. With no
strength left in her body and bitterness overwhelming her soul, she could do
nothing to stop herself from plowing uncontrollably forward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.5pt;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:

the Priestess of the Sun instead of falling flat on her stomach afterward. Face
pressed against the golden-haired girlÅfs firm bosom, beneath which her heart
was going wild, she felt her body being invaded with the little angelÅfs warmth.
She thought she was melting like wax on a lit candle. She could not say even a
word.</p>

ago, I met you in the Garden of the Roses and became your friend. Yet I never
told you what I was thinking in my head the moment I first laid my eyes on your
face.Åh Her forefinger began to trace AoiÅfs lips. It was gentle, it was loving,
and it was very warm. ÅgA voice at the back of my head was urging me to kiss you
and never stop. To tell you the truth, I still want to.Åh Her expression grew
saddened, her hand fell, and her mouth issued a quiet sigh. ÅgBut I guess itÅfs
too late for that now. WhatÅfs the point of getting a kiss from you when you
hate me so much?Åh</p>

heated it up rapidly.</p>

childhood friend, I still wonÅft hate you...Åh tears welled up in those beautiful
amethyst eyes, Ågbecause I love you more than anything in the world.Åh Her hands
rose to AoiÅfs cheeks, where she caressed them and held them gently while she,
seemingly without thinking, drew her face closer and closer. Yet, the moment
their lips were about to meet, the other Priestess realized what she was doing
and pulled her head away.</p>

that the little angel was using up every ounce of her strength to stop herself
from kissing her... even though it was killing her inside to do that. Tears
dropped from the Priestess of the SunÅfs eyes and fell upon AoiÅfs cheeks. They
were as hot as any fire. Then the full force of the confession hit her square
in the face. Her mind began to unravel. She had always thought that the person
the shorter girl was in love with was Oogami Souma. She had never suspected
that the girlÅfs romantic interest... was her.</p>

with her wide sleeves. It did nothing to stop the tears. ÅgAt least I could see

hugged Aoi as tightly as she could. After a few minutes, the golden-haired girl
untied her arms from around AoiÅfs body, laid her gently upon the ground, rose
to her feet, and picked up both Eyes of Heaven.</p>

unspeakable sadness. ÅgFarewell, Chikane-chan.Åh She turned around and walked
away. Looking at her retreating figure, Aoi felt herself reeling back to the
Priestess of the SunÅfs room three thousand year ago, where her hope, her dream,

Kannazuki Aoi screamed upon realizing that the golden ribbons that had attached
to her arms and legs earlier seized control over her entire body. Although she
never meant them to, she could still feel her own powers rising in her like the
strongest tides. When her fingers started to move, all that her right hand was
holding was air. When her fingers finished curving inwardly afterwards, her
hand was holding a fully sheathed sword. It was the Eye of Luna, Kagetsuki.
There was nothing she could do except watching her left hand wrap around the
scabbard and took it off. After it had dropped the blue scabbard onto the
ground, it joined her right hand in holding the swordÅfs hilt in such a way that
the EyeÅfs tip was aimed toward the heart of the Priestess of the Sun. ÅgPlease
donÅft make me do this, Akari! I beg of you!Åh</span></i></p>

full-throated wail left AoiÅfs throat and echoed endlessly inside the room just
as the little angel fell backward and landed on her back upon the floor with
the blade of the Eye of Luna still buried in her body. Shortly after that, the
bindings she had cast on AoiÅfs body vanished and dropped her on her front on
the tatami mat. The seal that the Priestess of the Sun had placed on the Moon
Crest was also undone. Celestial powers returned to her body and replenished
her physical strength.</span></i></p>
