<h1>Ame no Murakumo ga Miteru:  Red String (part 8 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kannazuki/index.html">Kannazuki no Miko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dezopengiun.html">DezoPenguin</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../kannazuki/redstring-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><p>Himeko was surprised. Chikane's father had gone and said it straight out, with little 
preamble or beating around the bush. The uncomfortable formality of the discussion thus far 
meant—to her—politely circling an issue instead of approaching it. Then again, she supposed 
that one could be straightforward in formal speech as well.</p><p>"We understand, 
Himemiya-sama," her father said. "Rest assured that we will take steps to make certain your 
family is no longer bothered by Himeko's unseemly affections."</p><p>"Pardon me," Hayate 
replied, "but it is quite clear that you do <i>not</i> understand."</p><p>The Kurusugawas 
looked puzzled.</p><p>"Himeko will of course make a formal apology to you, but I don't 
understand what more we can do," Himeko's mother said. "If there's a way we can set these 
rumors to rest, please tell us."</p><p>Himemiya Seiji let out his breath in a short, almost 
fierce exhalation that reminded Himeko of a martial artist in a samurai movie just at the 
moment when a blow was struck.</p><p>"The point we are making is that we aren't demanding 
that the girls separate."</p><p>Himeko's eyes widened as she gasped in surprise. 
Admittedly, she'd believed—hoped—that this was possible, from the way Chikane's parents had 
treated her at dinner and from what Chikane had told her, but to hear it said outright, 
actually put into words, sent a thrill through her. Chikane smiled at her from across the 
table.</p><p>"Forgive me, Himemiya-sama, but...you are correct. I <i>do not</i> understand. 
These appalling rumors..."</p><p>Seiji nodded.</p><p>"They are offensive, I agree. And from 
the standpoint of a business executive, unfortunate. But from the standpoint of a parent, I 
feel my ultimate concern must be my child's future happiness."</p><p>"But this must surely 
be a passing crush," Eiko replied. "It's not at all unusual for a young girl, with no 
experience of boys, to form an affection for another girl." She blushed faintly. "I...I 
once had a crush on one of my upperclassmen myself, when I was only a year younger than 
Himeko is now. But these things pass in time." She looked at Chikane's mother, perhaps in 
an attempt to appeal woman-to-woman to her. "Surely that isn't a reason to expose the girls 
to the attention and stigma of being homosexuals."</p><p>Hayate, however, did not seem to 
accept that reasoning.</p><p>"I have to admit, protestations of deathless love over a girl 
that Chikane met only two days ago would make me cynical as well. Seiji and I are not 
interested in watching our daughter's name blazoned across the tabloid headlines as she 
careens from infatuation to infatuation. I think that <i>if</i> we believed that was the 
case, we might well agree with you, simply because of the lack of judgment Chikane would 
have showed."</p><p>She glanced down the table at her daughter.</p><p>"You do realize, 
Chikane, that while we don't demand that you in any way conceal your sexuality or your 
relationship, we <i>do</i> expect that you conduct yourself with the same amount of 
discretion and propriety as we would if you were dating a boy?"</p><p>"Yes, 
Okaasama."</p><p>Hayate turned back to the Kurusugawas.</p><p>"Now, you're probably 
wondering why we can be certain that this is not just a phase Chikane is going through, or 
more to the point, since we accept that Chikane is indeed a lesbian, why this particular 
affection is genuinely <i>love</i>, not just a crush on a cute transfer student?"</p><p>"I 
certainly am," Hajime responded.</p><p>"Indeed," Eiko agreed.</p><p>Chikane's mother set 
the accordion file on the table, undid the closure, and opened the flap.</p><p>"Seiji said 
that we'd come back to this," she noted, then riffed through the contents and took out a 
page which she placed on the table.</p><p>It was a drawing in crayon, done in a child's 
crude, inexperienced hand, the kind of thing that decorated the fronts of refrigerators 
throughout the industrialized world. This one showed a house—some kind of building, 
anyway—with a large prayer gate over on the left-hand side. On the right were two people, 
little more than stick figures. Both seemed to be female, since they had long hair and 
skirts; one was blonde with red clothing, the other hand been drawn with dark blue hair and 
a violet outfit. The blonde appeared to have bright red cat ears which Himeko realized 
belatedly were the corners of her oversized bow. It was a picture of themselves as Solar 
and Lunar Priestesses on the moon. She had purple dots for eyes, and just to remove all 
doubt, the names "Himeko" and "Chikane" were written beneath their respective figures in 
clumsily formed kanji.</p><p>"Chikane drew that when she was four," Hayate explained. "When 
we asked her who Himeko was, she replied, 'my lover.'"</p><p>Himeko blushed furiously, 
since with the brutal honesty of a child, Chikane's word choice had definitely implied a 
sexual relationship.</p><p>"When I asked her what she meant, she said, 'when we grow up and 
meet each other again.' Of course, I put it down as an imaginative child's fantasy, 
combined with accidental exposure to an inappropriate vocabulary. However..."</p><p>She 
began to remove other pages: finger-paintings, watercolors, sketches, showing an evolution 
of time and talent as the four-year-old girl became five, six, eight, eleven, and fourteen. 
Himeko and Chikane in miko vestments, or in normal clothing, standing close or holding 
hands or, in a couple of scenes, with their hands bound together by red cord or 
string.</p><p>"Chikane never claimed that this Himeko was someone she actually spoke to, 
like a child's imaginary friend or something, just that this was the person she was going 
to meet one day in the future and fall in love with."</p><p>"But that's unbelievable," 
Hajime marveled, not actually expressing disbelief but just his amazement at the concept. 
"How could a child that age know something like that?"</p><p>"I...don't understand," Eiko 
said, looking through the various artwork, then up at her daughter. The later art, done in 
Chikane's teenage years, skillfully showed Himeko's features as if they'd been drawn from 
life, and even the earlier ones featured obvious things like her unusual eye color or her 
ubiquitous bow that she'd worn since she was ten.</p><p>"We treated the matter as a bit of 
a family joke," Hayate continued to explain, "as we supposed it could have been. But when 
the very real Himeko-chan appeared..." She shrugged. "In all honesty, my primary reason for 
running a background check on you, Kurusugawa-san, was not to examine your work records but 
to verify that, indeed, this wasn't an elaborate game that Chikane was playing on us. You 
must understand that when Himeko-chan walked into the dining room last night I had to 
suppress the urge to look for hidden cameras." She smiled sheepishly.</p><p>"I don't mind 
saying that I would have preferred that," Seiji spoke up.</p><p>"Otousama!"</p><p>"I'm not 
going to lie about it, Chikane. I would have been happier if my daughter didn't have to 
face the social stigma involved, dealing with the insulting comments and, more 
significantly, the practical prejudice in business dealings occasioned by the bigots and 
fools of the world. To say nothing of the consequences of the Himemiya family succession, 
given that you are not merely my eldest but my only child. So yes, I'd have preferred you 
choose a boy. Failing that, I'd have preferred a girl from a socially significant family, 
one with which we could have reached some mutually beneficial association." He shrugged. 
"But, you were right all along. I'm not stupid enough to try fighting something that was 
apparently settled when you were in the cradle."</p><p>"What I think my husband is getting 
at is, if we spend our time complaining about the girls' relationship, then we make 
ourselves part of the problem, the social stigma he talked about. I really don't want 
Chikane to be looking back on her life one day and think of her mother as 'part of the 
problem.'"</p><p>Himeko's gaze flicked from the Himemiyas to her parents, who didn't seem 
to know precisely what they were supposed to say. Not that there was much <i>to</i> say at 
that point, given how neatly they'd been pinned. If they objected to the girls' love on 
<i>moral</i> grounds, they were declaring themselves to be what Seiji had labeled outright 
as "bigots and fools." If they tried to fall back on other issues, then they moved into 
Hayate's "part of the problem." Except that, Himeko realized, they might not even be aware 
of all of that. They both kept looking at Chikane's pictures, then at Himeko, then back at 
the pictures.</p><p>It was her father who spoke up first.</p><p>"Himeko, did you know about 
this?"</p><p>"Chikane-chan didn't tell me that she'd drawn anything. I didn't even know she 
could sketch! But I knew she'd told her parents about us when she was young."</p><p>"That 
isn't what I meant, Himeko. I was asking, did you know about <i>her</i> before we came 
here?" He picked up one of the pages, a watercolor of the girls together in what might have 
been the Ototachibana Academy rose garden.</p><p><i>Oh. I should have realized that was 
what he was talking about,</i> Himeko thought, feeling a little foolish at having missed 
it.</p><p>"Um...yes, I did."</p><p>"You're saying that..." He looked at her, then down at 
the painting, then over at Chikane, then back at Himeko.</p><p>"But you never said 
anything, Himeko," her mother protested. "You never mentioned Himemiya-san..."</p><p>"I 
thought it would sound crazy," she admitted in a very small voice.</p><p>There were times 
when being an awful liar was actually a good thing. Before now, it was possible she could 
have talked about Chikane and her parents could have believed it was a delusion (which 
would have technically not been <i>lying</i>, since a deluded person thinks they're telling 
the truth), but now, in the face of evidence...</p><p>Hajime let out a heavy sigh.</p><p>"I 
suppose that isn't unfair. I can barely believe all of this even now. The idea that two 
girls could be tied together by fate or destiny—that <i>anyone</i> could, really. It's like 
something out of an old legend, not the modern age. And yet..." he waved his hand at the 
table. Then a thought seemed to strike him and his eyes lit up.</p><p>"My God! When I 
discussed the move to Mahoroba with Eiko, we had to weigh many factors about uprooting our 
lives. Shiro was worried about leaving all his friends, and the only life he had ever 
known. But you...you were happy and excited, Himeko. You didn't have a bad word to say 
about the move once you were told where it was we were moving <i>to</i>!"</p><p>"That's 
right," her mother agreed. "Himeko <i>was</i> completely happy about this 
move."</p><p>Himeko nodded.</p><p>"I knew, or at least I assumed, that Mahoroba would be 
where I'd meet Chikane-chan."</p><p>They both shook their heads in disbelief.</p><p>"I just 
don't know what to say," her father marveled. "All this..." He sighed. Hajime was a plain 
man used to the plain, ordinary life he led. Finding out that his daughter was involved in 
a lesbian romance—with the heiress of one of Japan's wealthiest families—in a way that had, 
apparently, been somehow preordained—was completely outside of his experience. Himeko felt 
sorry for both her parents. Nothing about her had gone as expected, from the relationship 
itself to the Himemiyas' acceptance and support of it to their reasons for doing so. Himeko 
could barely keep up with it all herself, and she knew the reasons for it!</p><p>"Himeko," 
he began, taking his wife's hand as he did, "your mother and I are still very disappointed 
in your allowing this matter to become a public scandal before you informed us about any of 
this. It caused a great deal of unpleasantness for your family. Though Himemiya-san has 
accepted the blame for that, there are nonetheless two of you acting together and I will 
expect proper behavior from you in the future."</p><p>"Yes, Otousan."</p><p>"Nonetheless, 
in light of what we've seen her, and as the Himemiya family graciously is offering its 
support of this unconventional relationship, your mother and I"—he paused and turned to 
Eiko, who trembled a bit before nodding, clearly still unsure of herself—"will withdraw our 
objections."</p><p>Joy surged over Himeko like a cresting wave.</p><p>"Otousan, Okaasan, 
thank you very much!"</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>"I think you should save your thanks 
for whatever deity is clearly watching out for the two of you."</p><p>Chikane's mother 
began gathering up her daughter's artwork.</p><p>"Now, with that settled, I believe that we 
need to discuss some of the practical aspects of how the families will address the various 
rumors that have begun. If we can agree on a united front, I believe that it will be easier 
on all of us. Perhaps Chikane and Himeko-chan would prefer to spend some time together 
while we talk?"</p><p>"Thank you, Okaasama; I believe that would be an excellent 
suggestion," Chikane said, directing a warm smile at Himeko.</p><p 
style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</p><p>The sound of the back door opening took Kuro's 
attention away from the game. He ran over to greet the girls as they came out into the 
yard, then dropped his ball at Himeko's feet and began to hop up on her legs. He barked 
happily, perhaps sensing her own mood.</p><p>"He reminds me of that puppy who once 
introduced us," Chikane said, "except that he's all black."</p><p>"His name is Kuro," 
Himeko said. "He's my little brother's dog."</p><p>"It's a pleasure to meet you, Kuro-san," 
Chikane said with mock formality.</p><p>"You'd better get used to her, Kuro," Himeko said; 
"she's going to be here an awful lot."</p><p>"I am?"</p><p>"Mmn! Now that it's settled that 
my father's not going to lose his job or anything from us being together, I'm going to make 
sure that my parents come to learn just how wonderful you are for me."</p><p>Chikane smiled 
wryly.</p><p>"I think that may prove to be a tall order, particularly where your mother is 
concerned. Your father at least seemed to accept that we are fated to be together, but she 
seems to genuinely dislike the idea."</p><p>"It's a little hard for her," Himeko said 
gamely, making Chikane chuckle. The dark-haired girl picked up the ball, waved it under 
Kuro's nose to get his attention, then flipped it back towards Shiro. The puppy went 
barreling pell-mell after it, nearly tumbling over his own feet, before pouncing on the 
ball and shaking it vigorously. Himeko giggled at the sight.</p><p>"Say, 
Himeko..."</p><p>"Yes, Chikane-chan?"</p><p>"Don't you think it ironic, what your father 
said?"</p><p>"My father? What did he say?"</p><p>"About thanking whatever deity was 
watching over us." She chuckled softly, not without bitterness. "If only he knew the half 
of it."</p><p>Himeko raised her eyes to the sky. Though it was still early afternoon, she 
imagined she could see the moon there, looking down on them.</p><p>"I don't know, 
Chikane-chan."</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>"Well...I don't remember that far back, and I don't think 
you do either, but...according to the legend, when Yamata no Orochi arose for the first 
time, we were the ones who prayed to the gods for help. I mean, it's called 
<i>Kannazuki</i>, right, the 'godless month,' so there shouldn't have been anyone to listen 
to those prayers. But...Ame no Murakumo did answer us, and granted us power to fight Yamata 
no Orochi like we still do. And then when Yamata no Orochi is beaten, it's Ame no Murakumo 
who revives the world through our sacrifice, and who stands sentinel over it forever and 
ever. I don't know if a god can feel pain or get lonely, but...it can't be easy, existing 
like that, can it? I can't hate Ame no Murakumo because I was too blind to see your 
feelings and you were too scared to tell them to me for so long." Himeko smiled at Chikane. 
"Besides, it's Ame no Murakumo that gives us the chance to be together, through life after 
life and between times, too."</p><p>Chikane chuckled again.</p><p>"So you think the God of 
Swords was looking at us and thought, 'Finally! It's about time they figured it 
out!'"</p><p>Himeko grinned back.</p><p>"Well, why not?"</p><p>Chikane let out a long sigh, 
then she smiled too and, like Himeko had, looked up at the sky.</p><p>"Why not, indeed?" 
she murmured. "Maybe you're right, Himeko."</p><p>The breeze stirred her bangs, and she 
combed them back out of her face with her fingers.</p><p>"I wonder how one offers a god an 
apology."</p><p>"You're a shrine maiden, Chikane-chan. I think Ame no Murakumo will 
hear."</p><p>"I could always mention it the next time we fight Orochi. Though, I think that 
may be a long time in coming."</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>"It's just a feeling I have. Something 
seems...different...about this lifetime, somehow."</p><p>"I don't really understand," 
Himeko said, frowning. Chikane shook her head.</p><p>"That's all right. It's probably 
nothing, anyway. Though if I'm ending up the optimist about something, then destiny is not 
only kind, it also has a sense of humor."</p><p>"Well, that's certainly 
true."</p><p>"Himeko!"</p><p>Himeko giggled. They were interrupted, then, by Kuro, who had 
finally figured out that he was supposed to retrieve Shiro's latest throw, but wasn't quite 
clear on just whom he was supposed to bring it to. He scampered up to Himeko and dropped 
the ball at her feet.</p><p>"Hey, Kuro, come back! You're supposed to fetch it to me!" He 
ran up to the girls and picked up the ball, then took a second look at Chikane, recognizing 
that she'd been standing with Himeko for a while. "Um, you're the girl from that limousine, 
aren't you? Who are you?"</p><p>"This is Himemiya Chikane," Himeko introduced her, then 
added with a happy smile, "She's my 
girlfriend."</p><p>"Girlfriend?"</p><p>"Mmn!"</p><p>Shiro's eyes widened.</p><p>"You mean 
like kissing and stuff?"</p><p>"I'm very partial to 'and stuff,'" Chikane 
teased.</p><p>Shiro looked at them suspiciously. "Aren't you supposed to do that with a 
boy?"</p><p>"No," Himeko said firmly, "I am very definitely not supposed to do that with a 
boy."</p><p>Then she turned to Chikane and amply demonstrated her point with a long, warm, 
loving kiss.</p>
