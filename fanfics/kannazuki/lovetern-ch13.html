text-indent:.5in'>Ame no Murakumo the Sword God was being frozen in a dreamless
sleep when suddenly his consciousness returned to him like the breaking dawn.
His eyes fluttering open, he found himself sitting in an armchair in the
familiar chamber that was his prison since he could not remember when.
Everything was the same as far as he could see. The furniture, despite being
destroyed numerous times by his powers, was still there, seemingly undamaged.
The vast golden lily field beyond the shoji door to this suffocating chamber
still lay beneath a sun that generated no warmth the way it was supposed to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Yet, something in him had changed. Unlike the previous times,
where he woke up in a violent start and where he could not move a muscle, he
now felt strength in his body and not a trace of the bindings that had been
imposed on his arms and legs. Gingerly, he placed his hands on the arms of the
chair and lifted himself up. It took him several tries before he could get back
on his feet without falling back onto the chair a second later. He knew that
this was happening because he had not used his body for only Heaven knew how
long. Soon, his strength would fully return, he was sure. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>To his astonishment, a vertical shaft of silver light
appeared right in front of him and proceeded to widen into the oval-shaped
silvery surface of a Dimensional Portal. His whole self bursting with joy and
excitement, he strode forward and passed through the door that would lead to
his freedom. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Rinne,</span></i>
was the only name that drifted across his mind when silver light enveloped him
whole.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>With her right hand clutching her left upper arm, Sei no
Tsurugi no Rinne stood exhausted on the rocky ground of the moon and quietly
cursed at the fearsome power of the Towa no Nagare sword. The Flow of Eternity
surely deserved its grand name, for it never snapped into two the way other
weapons would as soon as they came into contact with her true form. On
contrary, it managed to send so many shockwaves into her that her own body now
felt like a grape in the winepress. Truth be told, she had never expected that
Izanagi the weapon ignorant could forge something that gave this much trouble
to a weapon designed by the Lady of Reiha herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>She shook her head and put the Flow of Eternity out of her
mind. It was no longer important, for the Lord of Izumo had now been placed
under control of the woman whom he spent his days and nights mooning over.
Tsukiyomi, who face was cold enough to make ice seem hot, had her right hand
placed firmly on the manÅfs neck and her full attention on the smallest movement
of his body. Rinne suspected that if Izanagi tried to do something drastic, the
Goddess of the Moon would not hesitate in blasting him apart. When it came to
the safety of her sweetheart the Goddess of the Sun, there were very few things
that the silver-haired woman would <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>not</span></i>
do. Rinne snickered. It was high time the bastard Ruler of Heaven realized that
when he played with fire, he would get burned sooner or later. ÅgAnd TsukiyomiÅfs
anger is worse than any fire, bastard,Åh she murmured to herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>All thoughts took flight when she saw a heavy rain of
sparkling metal dust falling upon the surface of the moon. Even without looking
up, she knew that the Eyes of Heaven had been obliterated by the Red Thread of
Fate and the full force of the PriestessesÅf feelings toward each other. Her
heart began to pound. Now, with the two wretched swords out of the way, there
was nothing left to sustain the Core Sphere and the Thirteen Seals that
enveloped AkiraÅfs dimensional prison. Sure enough, she could see them
unraveling rapidly beneath the moonÅfs crust. As soon as they were completely
dissolved into the fabrics of space, a horizontally woven Dimensional Portal
emerged right upon the rocky ground. From it a pair of humongous steel gates
slowly surfaced. Once they had emerged completely, they swung open and revealed
a screen of blazing white light.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅgAkira!Åh</span></i>
she could not help but shout at the top of her lungs for the man she loved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Nothing happened at first... but after a few minutes, a
shadow marred the surface of the screen of light. Slowly, but steadily, the
dark patched, shaped like a human, began to gain solid form as it emerged. In
less than the time one needed to drink a cup of tea, Ame no Murakumo the Sword
God stood on the moon with a bewildered expression on his haggard face. In his
simple yukata, the man who was only one step below Izanagi in term of power
appeared someone who had been starved for days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgAkira!Åh she called again. Tears streaked down her cheeks. It
had been at least three thousand years since she last cried in joy like this.
All the tears she had shed ever since all came from the bitterness and the
heartbreaking pain that were only known to the walls of the OrochiÅfs Audience
Chamber.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The Sword God turned in her direction. As soon as his gaze
fell upon her, his mouth blossomed into a wholehearted smile and his platinum
eyes shone in unspeakable joy and love. The very sight turned her world upside
down. She felt so light-headed she could barely stand. She felt so overwhelmed
by the swelling emotions in her heart that she thought she was going to burst.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgRinne,Åh the man she loved called in an awkward voice &#8211; she
doubted he had used it even once during all the time he was imprisoned beneath
the surface of the moon &#8211; and walked stiffly toward her. Gradually, his pace
picked up as he started to run. He only managed it for a few feet before he
fell flat on his stomach upon the rough and devastated ground of what was once
the most beautiful place in the entire Creation Realm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Startled by AkiraÅfs fall, Rinne hurried toward him so that
she could help him up. The moment she reached him was also the one in which she
realized that she was about to make a terrible mistake. Horrified, she leapt
backward repeatedly until she landed upon the exact same spot where she started
and hoped that she had not managed to do harm to the man she loved. As far as
she was concerned, what she just did was pointless. The damage had already been
done. The Sword God had already clutched at his head with both hands and begun
to scream at the top of his lungs while agony contorted his handsome features.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Unbearable pain rippled across RinneÅfs entire self and
destroyed her balance. She sank to her knees and wept as hard as she could.
Eventually, the man she loved stopped screaming. Trembling, he slowly rose to
his feet. Forehead drenched with sweat, he gazed at her with a shocked and
pained face. ÅgWhat... has happened to you, Rinne?!Åh he asked afterwards, his voice
mirroring his expression. He had already realized that she was no longer the
woman he knew and loved. He had already noticed the corruption swirling in her
soul and tainting her once pure existence. It had been the darkness she had
spent the last three thousand years drawing from the hearts of the mortals that
hurt him, she knew. It was inevitable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgI am sorry, Akira,Åh she sobbed. ÅgI am sorry.Åh She turned and
hurried away. In the beginning, she had meant to sacrifice herself along with
the souls of the Orochi to free Akira. Never once did she imagine that it was
possible for them both to be alive at the same time. Never once did she think
of what she needed to say to the Sword God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgPlease, come back, Rinne!Åh he called desperately after her.
The more he did, the harder she ran. To her dismay, the man never intended to
let her do as she wished. Not long after he stopped calling, she felt an
irresistible force being exerted upon her body and pulling her back. By the
time she realized that unlike his physical strength, his celestial powers were
intact, she had already found herself engulfed in the Sword GodÅfs embrace.
Horror struck her as soon as she saw that smoke was billowing wherever they
touched. The darkness she had accumulated was practically burning Akira inside
out. If he kept on holding her, he was going to perish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgLet go of me!Åh she screamed and struggled to set herself
free. She never succeeded. Her powers had already been exhausted after the
deadly fight with the Flow of Eternity. There was simply no way she could
escape from someone who had sealed up all her movements by injecting his
energies into her soul. ÅgLet go, please, I beg you!Åh she sobbed. ÅgIf you do
not... you will die!Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The Sword God did not say anything in reply. Instead, he
delved into her soul and read her memories. Unable to stop someone much
stronger than her, she could only lie in his arms and weep while he learned all
the crimes that she had committed during the last three thousand years.
Meanwhile, the smoke continued to rise and quietly dissipated into the cold air
of the moon. Within every minute that passed, AkiraÅfs condition worsened. The
longer he held her in his arm, the paler his complexion grew and the more his
lips tightened in evident pain. After several minutes, his breathing became
ragged, heavy, and irregular while his whole body shook from the strain it had
to put up with. His teeth were biting on his underlip so hard in order to stop
any sound from escaping that blood eventually trickled out of the corner of his
mouth. Seeing him suffering because of her so, Rinne only wished that Towa no
Nagare had torn her apart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgAll the sins you have committed were all for my sake,Åh he
murmured in a week voice when he was done with accessing her memories. ÅgI do
not intend to leave them be, Rinne.Åh Powers exploded in him and flooded into
her body like a tidal wave. RinneÅfs breath caught as she suddenly understood
what he was trying to do. Since she was the embodiment of the darkness of the
human soul and Akira the personification of the sacred light, their powers
could not mix and would end up nullifying each other. The Sword God, in fact,
was cleansing her soul with his life as the cost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅgNo!Åh</span></i>
she shouted. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>ÅgStop, Akira!Åh</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgDo not waste your breath, Rinne,Åh said the man she loved,
whose voice was growing weaker after every word. ÅgI am not changing my mind.Åh
He gave her a shaky smile as though wanting to comfort her. All he did was
making her panic even more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgWhy are you doing this?!Åh she cried. ÅgEverything I did, I
did to save you! Why are you throwing your life away?!Åh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgA life where I cannot stay close to you is not a life worth
living,Åh Akira answered and smiled sadly at her. ÅgDeath is much more pleasant a
choice.Åh The smoke had grown so dense that it now obscured the majority of the
Sword GodÅfs figure. The only part of him that she could see was his face, which
had become much more haggard then when he first came out of his dimensional
prison. It was as though life force was being drained out of him at a
staggering rate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Knowing that nothing she could do &#8211; it was not as though she
could do anything while being sealed within his arms &#8211; would change her loverÅfs
mind, Rinne invoked every ounce of powers that were left in her and triggered
an internal explosion that destroyed all her organs except her brain and her
heart. Blood spilled from the orifices on her face at the same time that a
painful cry was strummed off her vocal cords. In less than a minute, she would
die. She only hoped that she lost her life before Akira lost his.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgNo!Åh the Sword God cried. ÅgWhat in HeavenÅfs name...!Åh</p>

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgStop... what you are... doing,Åh she breathed. ÅgThere is no
point... cleansing a corpse.Åh Her vision darkened. Her body grew cold. Her skin
became so numb that she could barely feel AkiraÅfs touch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>ÅgYou are still the stubborn girl I know,Åh he let out an
agonized and bitter laugh. ÅgBut you are too late.Åh He sighed. ÅgWell then, I
guess it is not that bad a thing to leave this world with you.Åh His arms
tightened around her body. ÅgLet us hope... that we can meet again, Rinne.Åh</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

smoke gradually faded into the night air and left behind nothing except a
crystal sword that stood lonely with its blade buried half way into the ground.
Then all of a sudden, the true form of Sei no Tsurugi no Rinne crumbled into a
wave of sparkling dust, which was eventually scattered to the furthest corners
of the lonely moon by the cruel winds of October, and six small orbs of light
that were undoubtedly the souls of the Orochi that she herself had slain
earlier. Those orbs, after a while of staying motionless above the ground,
rushed upward and joined the eternal current that was the Cycle of Death and
Rebirth.</p>

were reunited, they would help her combat the Ruler of Heaven and bring the man
to his knees. She never once thought that Yue, someone who had always done her
best to prove her hostility toward her, would be the person who saved her hide
and forced Izanagi into submission. Neither did she envision a future where the
Sword God and his lover perished right after the former escaped from his
dimensional prison.</p>

little brother it took all her remaining strength to rein in her tears, she
knew that she had no time for mourning. Quickly, she spun on her heel and found
herself facing the Lord of Izumo afterwards. The man, still under a shock from
seeing how the two greatest of his worries just killed themselves, simply
stared at where Akira and Rinne once were, appearing to have forgotten that the
hand of the Goddess of the Moon was still on the nape of his neck. Yue, on the
other hand, did not seem to register much of the terrible event that just
transpired the way she fixed her silver eyes upon the Ruler of Heaven. Not that
Yui ever expected the girl to, of course. She had never been close to the
Seraphim Blade or the Sword God.</p>

Chikane and Kurusugawa Himeko, whose hands were locked firmly together and
whose faces were painted with utmost confusion. Standing high in the air was
Saotome Makoto the Eighth Head, who seemed to have a much better understanding
of the situation than the other two girls did.</p>

girl in the dark cape. She never had a chance to do anything before a
Dimensional Portal, which opened abruptly without any warning beneath her feet,
pulled her inside and vanished. Now that Sei no Tsurugi no Rinne was gone, the
Twilight Blade in MakotoÅfs hand was just a useless piece of black metal. She
didnÅft have any means to create a dimensional passage that could get her back
to Onogoro.</p>

the Goddess of the Moon afterwards. In response, the silver-haired girl gave a
grave nod of her head and continued to observe the Ruler of Heaven, who in turn
was studying Yui with a mixed expression on his face. Were she to guess, she
would say that the man was enraged by her actions as well as curious as to what
she was going to do next.</p>

her snowy hagoromo two gold bracelets identical to her own, upon which the
shape of the Crystal Rose and elegant vines and leaves were inlaid. Although
the two girls looked at her curiously at first, they still complied. Once they
finished, they looked at her once again with unasked questions shining in their
beautiful sapphire and amethyst eyes. She winked at them to tell them that they
would get an explanation soon enough, just not now. The nods they gave in
return told her that they understood. Pleased, Yui walked back to where the
Goddess of the Sun and the Ruler of Heaven was. </p>

voice as she threw her arms around the Priestesses of the Sun and Moon and
pulled them into a tight hug. Overwhelmed by happiness, she called their names
over and over again while tears fell silently down her cheeks. During the last
three thousand years, she had spent her nights weeping for her lost love as
much as she did for her beloved children, who were sacrificed for no other
purpose than IzanagiÅfs punishment for Sei no Tsurugi no Rinne the Seraphim
Blade. Yui she could do nothing about &#8211; she doubted that she ever could &#8211; but

against YueÅfs bosom as her arms tightened around her back. Touched by the
sincerity in the Moon PriestessÅfs tearful words, Yue held her a little bit
closer while one of her hands combed through the luxuriant tresses of her
daughterÅfs hair.</p>

I will find a way to give you back your past-life memories. Once I do, you will
remember who I am... and our family can be whole again, little one.Åh She hugged
Himeko tightly and wept openly atop her shoulder. Although the girl was very
still at first, probably surprised by what Yue had just revealed to her, she
put her hands on YueÅfs back and stroked it gently as though she wanted to sooth

bastard Lord of Izumo standing in front of a Dimensional Portal. The former
appeared quite regretful while the latter watched her over his shoulder with a

not hesitate in ripping the heart of the Sun Goddess out of her chest.</p>

gestured cheerfully at the whirling surface. ÅgNow, hurry, or weÅfll miss the show.Åh
As if to demonstrate that it was not dangerous at all, the woman walked into
the Dimensional Portal as disappeared as quickly as the Ruler of Heaven had.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Sighing, she decided that the Priestess of the Moon was
right. Although Yue had always viewed the Sun Goddess as a childish and
thoughtless Immortal, the events that had transpired today undoubtedly proved
that the woman was not. Yue still gave the blue-haired child a playful look in
the end, though. ÅgYou are just saying that because she saved your lover, are
you not?Åh she joked and laughed softly when she saw spots of color blooming
fiercely on ChikaneÅfs face. Little Himeko did not fare any better the way she
dropped her gaze and took up an intense studying of the ground with a
complexion that could shame a sunset.</p>

waiting.Åh She strode forward and entered the Dimensional Portal with her entire
self bursting with power and ready for ambush. No matter what Yui and little
Chikane said, there was nothing wrong with being careful. If anything happened,
she still would have time to send the children back and close down the Portal
before they were harmed.</p>

aghast and bloodless, limbs trembling violently it was a wonder how they
managed to support him, and body without a scrap of power. Towering over him
was the Goddess of the Sun, who was surveying the heavens with an extremely
satisfied affection on her face. As Yue looked upward to see what could have
pleased the golden-haired High Immortal, her jaw fell and could not be pulled
back up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

except the clouds that had been surfing them since time immemorial. Now, she
could see the vast city of Reiha hanging upside down at the furthest reach of
the blood-red twilight sky. Directly beneath them were five huge and oddly
looking structures, each of which appeared to be carved out of a different type
of precious stone, with their middles linked together by an energy ring. From
the very same ring the transparent petals of the Crystal Roses were being
generated at a neck-breaking rate, fluttering down like snow in the cool air,
and formed a thick bed upon the empty boulevards of Heaven.</p>

struggling to get back on his feet. She had finally understood why Izanagi was
behaving as though he had lost all of his powers. <i><span style='font-family:

style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>They have imposed a Sealing Field on

gazed back at her with a playful gleam in her beautiful golden eyes. <i><span

Chikane, who was surveying the surrounding with utmost shock painted across her
face. Standing next to her and holding her hand very tightly was the Priestess
of the Sun Kurusugawa Himeko, who did not appear to register that there was
something very wrong with the city of the Immortals. For all Yue knew, the girl
might have thought that the upside down city in the sky and the falling rose
petals were things that happened to Izumo on a daily basis.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>ÅgAre you feeling alright, children?Åh she asked the two girls.
The nods that she received in return shocked her so greatly she staggered
backward. This was not supposed to be happening. Since neither were the
Priestesses Reiha-born nor did they spend at least one year in the Heart of the
Underworld, they should have been affected by the Crystal Roses. Yet they did
not. While the Lord of Heaven, much stronger than them, lost all of his powers,
they retained theirs. It made no sense at all.</p>

bracelet identical to those that she had given the children before they came
here. </p>

the golden-haired Immortal quietly. ÅgWhat are you two trying to do?Åh It was
only then did she notice that something was very wrong with the woman to whom
she never disclosed her love. Her complexion, usually healthy, had taken on a
sickly shade of white. Her golden eyes were tired. Her breathing was a little
irregular. Worst of all, her powers were gradually fading like tide ebbing from
the beach.</p>

her attention on the Lord of Izumo, who was invoking every scrap of strength he
possessed to stay on his feet. The man was indeed formidable, for anyone else
in his place would be trembling on the ground at this moment and would not be
to stand up until at least a few hours later. ÅgShall we go, my lord?Åh she told
Izanagi in a cold and flat voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

heartfelt concerns like she just did.</p>

them into the heart of the Holy City. Their destination, according to the

Priestesses of the Sun and Moon, all of whom were wearing different expressions
on their faces. IzanagiÅfs were painted with fury while his eyes could have done
for the sharpest swords. The Goddess of the Moon was looking at her in
surprise. Her childhood friend, whose face was unnaturally pale in the light
descending from the myriad orbs of light hanging beneath the vaulted ceiling,
apparently shared IzanamiÅfs good&nbsp; mood the way the golden-haired Immortal
gave her a smile and a respectful incline of her head. The Priestess of the
Moon was eyeing her in shock &#8211; she believed that the child knew who she was &#8211;

afraid of the other Immortals in this vast Hall.</p>

himself on the very center of the floor enclosed by the row of seat on which
she sat. Chuckling, the Goddess of the Sun went to the part of the wall near
the entrance, where her brothers Susanou no Mikoto and Kagutsuchi were
standing. Next to the High Commanders of Heaven were the two Chancellors of the
Underworld, who offered the golden-haired Immortal respectful bows before
flanking the girl on either side and starting to whisper to her with voices too
low to carry. From the way concern painted their identical faces, Izanami did
not have to be a genius to figure out that they, too, were very worried about
AmaterasuÅfs health.</p>

a very disturbing rate.</p>

afterwards while the rest of the Celestial Assembly began to converse with one
another in panic. He was definitely a very dangerous man.</p>

of the World that nothing pleasant would happen to him should he chose the
second route. The way that the manÅfs lip compressed into a thin line told her
that he got the message. The Celestial Assembly did too, so they gnashed their
teeth and fumed in silence. Takami no Mikoto and Kami no MikotoÅfs faces could
have done for a volcanoÅfs mouth.</p>

her feet. She doubted that even Amaterasu, who had been the major planner in

great and alarming that Susanou no Mikoto and Kagutsuchi decided to place
themselves firmly in front of their blood sister while Tsukazaki Haruhi moved
in front of the Goddess of the Moon and her children. The other Chancellor
started toward Izanami at first with a pace painted with worries but went with
her sister in the end when Izanami gave the girl a shake of her head.</p>

anything other than letting out a hopeless cry before they, too, collapsed.</p>

was going to do to them afterwards. She doubted that anything the creep could
come up with would be pleasant.</p>

took away his power, it still left his self-healing ability intact.</p>

the Lord of Izumo.</p>

a rose bracelet from inside her hagoromo and gave it to the creep. Izanagi, who
looked at the object the way one would a viper, grimaced before he put it on

Himeko and Himemiya Chikane. ÅgLittle children, it is time you return to your
world,Åh she told them. The events that are coming to pass in this place were
definitely not suitable for them to watch. Besides, it was the Goddess of the
SunÅfs express wish that they did not. ÅgFive minutes are all you have for
farewells. You should hurry.Åh</p>

back to the Goddess of the Moon.</p>

in gently. ÅgThey have to go.Åh A wave of her hand raised another wind that
pulled the Goddess of the Moon away from the Priestesses. A second one wove a
horizontal Dimensional Portal that floated just a few inches above their head.
A third pulled the silvery surface down and erased the seventeen-year-old girls
as it went. When the Portal thinned and melted on the cold marble floor, the
once prisoners of fate had already vanished.</p>

Underworld, who simply smiled at her and hugged her warmly in return.</p>

proceeded to offer Izanami nine bows, each of which was low enough for her
forehead to touch the floor, before she rose unsteadily back to her feet.</p>

said, not bothering to mention that it was the Moon Goddess who refused to
respond when she tried to initiate a conversation. As tears quietly rolled down
her face, the layer of Crystal Rose petals on her hagoromo began to break
apart. Those thin and transparent petals, as a result, rose upward as if in a
vertical gust of wind and finally melted into nothingness. ÅgBut... I do wish

despised her, a part of her heart died. Yet, she persevered. She thought that
if she could just stay by your side and watch over you everyday, she might be
able to continue living. She was wrong. In the end, her will to live
shattered.Åh</p>

TsukiyomiÅfs face. ÅgThat is right, child. It was the Eyes of Heaven. When a
certain someoneÅfs study found her shuffling through the document in his study,
he became deathly afraid that she would become a threat to his precious Project
Kannazuki, so he decided to make sure that she would not. Ruthlessly, he used
the Mirror of Life to bind her soul to the Eyes of Heaven so that if anything
happened to them, the Goddess of the Sun would be torn apart. That someone

free and being united with the one he loved. He had no idea that he was in fact
inflicting damages upon the well nigh indestructible Eyes of Heaven, which in
turn transferred them to Amaterasu whole.Åh The woman heaved a deep sigh. ÅgSo

Heaven. She did not die right then and there only because the Suishou no Bara

to her feet, took a few steps backward, and left the Goddess of the Moon

the occasional groaning of the Celestial Assembly. Izanagi swallowed hard. He
had realized that TsukiyomiÅfs crying had ceased. The girl, instead, was
gathering her celestial powers. The air grew cold. The ground began to show
sign of an imminent upheaval. The members of the Assembly, having noticed the
danger, wailed out loud and tried to get back on their feet just so they could
flee to safety. The Sealing Field insisted that they stayed on the ground. His
attention whipped back to the silver-haired Immortal, however, the moment
silver light emerged from her body in the most menacing manner ever.</p>

soon as she finished calling his name the way she would an enemy, powers
exploded in her. Endless waves of pressure crashed against his body and tried
to knock him down. The ground started to rise and fall as though being in an
earthquake. The rolling motion of the floor broke the marble tiles, ruptured
the wooden rows of seat, and sent flailing and screaming Assembly members into
the air.</p>

slammed its edge against the head of the pillar from beneath. In a deafening
roar, the spell changed its direction and shot upward. It was so powerful that
it punched cleanly through the vaulted ceiling the same way a sharp knife would
flesh. What was there in the end was a large hole through which one could see a
night sky dominated by a full moon. Night had come, and so did the time when
TsukiyomiÅfs powers grew strongest.</p>

great sphere, it also unleashed a heavy rain of silver arrows toward him. Most
of those he destroyed with Towa no Nagare. The others broke themselves on a
cylindrical barrier woven in such a way that it enclosed the space surrounded
by the lowest row of seat. On an undamaged part of it Izanami sat and idly
looked at her lam, from the wound on which blood was still flowing out. Behind
her stood the two High Commanders of Heaven and the Chancellors of the Underworld.
IzanagiÅfs eyes went wide. One of the raven-haired girls was holding a large orb
of light, in which floated the black and white fragments of the most powerful
magical weapon in the Three Worlds. It was what remained of the Mirror of Life.
<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Where did she get that?!</span></i>

Right now, she was holding so much power in her body that she could very well
destroy half of the Holy City with just one blast. She frightened Izanagi no
end. The situation was bad. Although Towa no Nagare was a powerful weapon, it
did not offer him much help. The battle he had with the Goddess of the Sun just
a while ago had but drained half of his energy. Against the silver-haired
Immortal, whose strength was being greatly augmented by her grief and thirst
for revenge, he had little chance of surviving, especially when she meant to
take his life at all cost.</p>

thought in horror. It was the most devastating spell that the silver-haired
Immortal ever knew. Were it to be fully unleashed, it would destroy anything in
its path except for the Mirror of Life and the Eyes of Heaven. However, its
terrifyingly destructive power was not what was frightening him witless. What
was, was the fact that the Goddess of the Moon was standing right atop the
opening of the spell. At the very instant that she shot, she, too, would be
reduced to ashes. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>She means

out of the Core immediately. However, it was not that simple, for he was aware
that Tsukiyomi could pinpoint his position anywhere in the sky and strike with
such accuracy and speed that he would be dead before he could think of evading.
Besides, he did not want to flee, for if he did, the one he loved would die
right in front of his eyes. That had never been his intention. Even if every
resident of Heaven perished, he still wanted Tsukiyomi to live.</p>

caught sight of the Regent of the Underworld again. Even when her daughter was

then that it struck him. He finally understood why Izanami refused to let her
wound heal, why she instigated the Moon GoddessÅfs anger, and why her
subordinate was holding the fragments of the Mirror in her hands.</p>

into the room right next to his. Much as he loved his brother, it was never his

of a mother with too much time on her hand. Souma muttered darkly under his

casual clothing that made it impossible for anyone to guess that she used to

This was the first morning Chikane did not come down for breakfast like always
after all. A while ago, she even heard anxious footsteps outside the room. <i><span

long eyelashes cast flickering shadows on a face beautiful beyond words. In her
chest, rising and falling gently and most seductively, a wonderful heart was
beating in rhythm with ChikaneÅfs own. Snuggled in her embrace was the most magnificent
being ever created. Alone, the former Priestess of the Sun was worth much more

turned. The whole world aside from her and her beloved girlfriend might as well

against hers in the rhythm of their quest to learn the secrets of each otherÅfs

wanted it, she declined by putting a finger against her loverÅfs lips. She had
an idea why Himeko was behaving this way, though. Ever since she returned to
bed from the sudden phone call last night, the former Sun Priestess had
practically glued herself onto her and refused to let go. Not that Chikane
minded the intimacy, of course.</p>

lose the ability to see the sparkling Red String of Fate entwining their little
fingers. Still, she knew that Enishi was still there, and would be for all
eternity, regardless of how many reincarnations they might take. Until the end
of time, they would be born on the same day, same hour, near to one another,
their feelings intact. Their lives, their hearts were one now. If no God could
separate them, no man would, even if that man was her Father. She had promised
Himeko to never leave her side again, and she would pay any price to keep it.</p>
