<h1>Ame no Murakumo ga Miteru:  Red String (part 1 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kannazuki/index.html">Kannazuki no Miko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dezopengiun.html">DezoPenguin</a><br> </h2>
<P>The burgundy-and-white school uniform, with its over-elaborate string tie, leg-o-mutton 
sleeves, black tights, and double row of gold buttons, gave her a warm, nostalgic feeling 
as she walked through the halls of Ototachibana Academy. She was only half-listening to the 
teacher who was guiding her, instead caught up in the flood of memories brought back by 
these so familiar halls that she'd never walked.</P><P>"And this will be your homeroom," he 
concluded, stopping in front of a door. She only belatedly realized that he <I>had</I> 
stopped and almost crashed into him on account of it, then nearly slipped and fell when she 
halted just in time, but regained her balance by bracing her hand against the 
wall.</P><P>"I'm sorry, Fujieda-sensei."</P><P>He shook his head.</P><P>"It's all right to 
be a bit nervous, but don't worry. I'm sure that you'll enjoy your time here at 
Ototachibana Academy."</P><P>"Yes, thank you, sensei."</P><P>He knocked on the door, then 
stepped inside, where he spoke briefly to the teacher who was already present and provided 
her with some paperwork. He then turned back to the girl, smiled, and said, "Good 
luck!"</P><P>Her homeroom teacher, a slim woman with glasses and dark hair in a pageboy 
cut, let her into the room. At her request the girl wrote her name on the blackboard, 
forming the characters in a slightly childish hand.</P><P>"Class," the teacher announced, 
"we are joined by a new transfer student starting today. I hope that you will make her feel 
welcome." She turned to the girl, who introduced herself.</P><P>"Good morning," she said a 
little nervously as she faced the class full of her fellow second-years. "My name is 
Kurusugawa Himeko. It's nice to meet you, and Iâ€”" She stopped, her heart in her throat, 
suddenly paralyzed by the sight of two robin's-egg-blue eyes. 
"Ch-Chikane-chan?"</P><P>Smoothly, the owner of those eyes rose from her seat, imparting 
the simple movement with an elegant grace. Long blue-black hair was held off her face by a 
headband and fell to the back of her knees. Her skin was porcelain-pale, her features 
fine-boned and beautiful, her figure sleek and womanly, every bit of her exactly as Himeko 
had carried in her memory for the past sixteen years. Himeko's legs shook a little; the 
longing that welled up in her was nearly overwhelming and it was all she could do to keep 
from rushing across the room and seizing the beauty in her arms and sobbing out her joy at 
seeing her again. Indeed, only the knowledge of the embarrassment it would cause Chikane 
kept her from doing exactly that.</P><P>"Morishima-sensei, there is an empty seat next to 
me where Kurusugawa-san could sit. I would be happy to assist her become accustomed to our 
school."</P><P>"Very well, Himemiya-san. Kurusugawa-san, Himemiya Chikane-san is our class 
president and will be more than capable of introducing you to whatever you 
need."</P><P>"Yes, thank you, sensei."</P><P>Himeko wasn't quite sure how she managed to 
walk between the rows of students, girls in burgundy-and-white and boys in viridian blue. 
She was faintly aware of the curious looks and low whispers but only distantly, like a 
painted backdrop on a stage set. She couldn't help but extend a hand, though, and Chikane's 
fingers curled around hers, cool and soft, a sweetly remembered touch she'd never felt, and 
her eyes brimmed with tears of joy.</P><P>"I missed you, Himeko," was all Chikane said, but 
her smile nearly made the other girl burst with happiness. Not surprisingly, there were a 
number of interested or surprised looks, but the girl seated behind Chikane, a ponytailed 
redhead, was staring at them with an utterly overwhelmed expression.</P><P>To say that 
Himeko's morning passed by in a blur did not describe the half of it. She barely was aware 
of anything beyond Chikane's presence, the part of her missing since birth finally found. 
The lunch bell's ringing jolted her out of a haze, and Chikane slipped from her seat and 
leaned close enough to murmur three words, "The rose garden," before blending with the 
crowd.</P><P>It was still there, just as she remembered it, the shining brass fence and the 
hedge of multicolored rose bushes. Even the gap between bushes where the trunks were far 
enough apart to allow a body to pass through was right where it was supposed to be. Himeko 
crawled through without hesitation. There was the stately English oak at the center of the 
circular clearing, its branches heavy with the fresh green leaves of spring. And beneath 
it...</P><P>"Chikane-chan!"</P><P>"Himeko!"</P><P>There were no more words; words were 
superfluous and could certainly wait until later. Himeko scrambled to her feet and flung 
herself at the taller girl and Chikane caught her, their arms closing tightly around each 
other and their mouths crushing together fiercely, not the gentle brushing of lips as might 
be expected of sixteen-year-old maidens but a kiss of passionate longing, a need for 
intimacy pent-up since before they'd been born. Their hands tightened in cloth, grabbing 
fistfuls of their uniforms to hold each other as close as possible and murmured endearments 
every time they paused for breath before leaning in to capture each other's sweetness 
again.</P><P>A rustling in the hedge disturbed their momentary idyll, surprising them and 
making them drop the kiss. Himeko would have broken the embrace, too, but Chikane kept a 
firm grip on her waist and if her beloved didn't want to let go then she didn't see a 
reason why she herself should have to be denied even a moment of holding Chikane. In the 
next instant the redhead who'd been in the desk behind Chikane squirmed through the gap in 
the hedge.</P><P>"Um, wow, third wheel to the max, huh?" she said, looking at the two of 
them, then shot an accusing look at Chikane. "You <I>said</I> to give you two fifteen 
minutes before I came barging in. And <I>you</I>!" She turned to Himeko. "I can't believe 
you really exist! I mean, there's not some hidden camera crew ready to pounce, 
right?"</P><P>Himeko blinked.</P><P>"Huh?"</P><P>"Miya's famous Himeko! Well, not really 
famous, since Miya only talks about you to me and sometimes Saya and Arrow, but the 
principle applies. I mean, seriously, some dream lover out of a past life destined to find 
her? Not big on the believability scale, y'know. Oh, I'm Alice Ishida." She stuck out a 
hand, Western-style, while Himeko tentatively shook.</P><P>"It's...nice to meet you, 
Ishida-san?" she said hesitantly.</P><P>"Alice is a Canadian of Japanese descent," Chikane 
explained, having no trouble with the pronunciation of the foreign name.</P><P>"We're a 
branch family, so my great-granddad decided to seek his fortune in foreign lands, but my 
dad ended up being the heir to the main line so we came back when I was ten."</P><P>"She's 
also been by best friend since she first came here."</P><P>The significance of that simple 
statement took a couple of seconds to sink in, but when it did, combined with the fact that 
Alice apparently knew something about <I>her</I>, Himeko could feel herself break into a 
huge smile.</P><P>"You've got a real friend, Chikane-chan? I'm so happy!" Her hands slid up 
from waist to shoulders and she gave Chikane a crushing hug. Chikane laughed, and Alice 
scratched her head.</P><P>"Um...why is that a big deal?"</P><P>Himeko didn't want to answer 
because it was Chikane's private business, but Chikane herself spoke 
up.</P><P>"Himeko...isn't used to me having friends, not genuine ones."</P><P>"She would 
always keep people at arm's length," Himeko elaborated, omitting some of the more painful 
details.</P><P>"Oh, yeah, she certainly does that. Total princess material."</P><P>Himeko 
giggled while Chikane just sighed. It was so <I>weird</I> to see Chikane letting someone 
else slip inside the armor of her reserve, the polished perfection that she used to keep 
the world at bay, but it was neat, too. It meant that slowly, gradually, the elegant girl 
was putting her shattered soul back together. And best of all, Chikane understood at once 
what it was that had so moved Himeko!</P><P>"We...should have lunch," Chikane said. She'd 
already laid out a blanket on the grass so the girls could sit down without getting stains 
on their skirts, and the three of them sat, Chikane and Himeko with their backs to the 
tree, their hips touching, and Alice on Chikane's far side but with a little separation 
between them and turned sideways towards the two. Himeko and Chikane got out their lunch 
boxes but Alice didn't seem to have one.</P><P>"Do you want some of my lunch, Ishida-san?" 
Himeko offered at once, but Alice waved it off.</P><P>"Nah, I scarfed a yakisoba roll while 
I was waiting for you guys to finish smooching. Nice of you to ask, though. And call me 
Alice, okay? Half my life here and I still can't get used to all this 
formality."</P><P>"All right, Arisu-chan," Himeko said.</P><P>"But really, you're as nice 
as Miya says you are. I mean, not only have you known me for all of thirty seconds but I'm 
butting in on your lovey-dovey moment and yet you're still offering to share 
lunch?"</P><P>Himeko blushed.</P><P>"Um...if you don't mind, what else did Chikane-chan say 
about me?"</P><P>Alice grinned.</P><P>"Mind? Miss a free shot at embarrassing the living 
daylights out of the perfect Miya-sama? Himeko, girl, you've handed me a gift on a silver 
platter!" She laced her fingers together and stretched like an athlete stretching to warm 
up.</P><P>"First off, she described you physically so perfectly that it was like I'd seen a 
photo of you, which is why I was gaping at you when you came in this morning. Okay, she 
exaggerated the cuteness a little bit, but she's in love so we can excuse that, while as to 
details...She says you're sweet and nice to the point of being a little naive and that 
you're always willing to undergo discomfort for somebody else's sake. On the other hand, 
you're not always sensitive to what other people are feelingâ€”although you're getting 
better!â€”so it's important to be as honest to you as you are to everyone else. And you are 
honest; even if you try to lie it shows up right on your face for everyone to see. You're a 
little bit clumsy and easily scared or surprised, but when the going gets tough you'll see 
things through to the end no matter how hard or painful it gets, and that even when bad 
things happen you'll brush them aside and move on, and support her too into the bargain." 
Grinning, Alice added, "She also said that you're a little bit ditzy, not great in school, 
but that you have an excellent artistic eye, are good at photography, and that we should 
draft you for the kendo team even though you're generally poor at sports and don't like 
hitting people."</P><P>"You make me sound like some kind of amazing person. I'm not, 
really," Himeko said, really embarrassed.</P><P>"Hey, you captured the heart of the girl 
whom ninety percent of the boys and half the girls dream of at night. I'd call that 
amazing. Be prepared for a fair whack of jealousyâ€”though you'll also get a good bit of 
worship-by-proxy."</P><P>Alice turned on Chikane, who was serenely eating her lunch, a 
little smile on her face.</P><P>"And you! Why aren't you even a little embarrassed, after 
I'm spilling all the gushing-over-the-girlfriend-you-don't-have bits to the girl in 
question?"</P><P>"Himeko knows how I feel about her," she said calmly. There's nothing to 
surprise her. And she knows the very worst of me, much more than you do."</P><P>"Oh, 
please, like you've ever done a contemptible thing in your life."</P><P>"Not in this life, 
perhaps."</P><P>"That is so weird. And then <I>you</I> show up," Alice exclaimed, pointing 
at Himeko, "and prove her <I>right</I>. It's not normal, I tell you!" She was grinning 
while she said it, though, making clear that she wasn't in any way angry or annoyed. "On 
the other hand, Saya now owes me dinner at <I>Maison Blanc et Noir</I>."</P><P>"Oh, is that 
still here?" Himeko asked. She and Chikane had shared a few dates at the French restaurant 
in their past lives.</P><P>That was at the heart of it, of course. In <I>this</I> life 
Himeko had never before met Chikane or been to Mahoroba, but the two shrine maidens of Ame 
no Murakumo had been reborn many times whenever the malice of the world would give rise to 
the dark god Yamata no Orochi. They would fight to seal the darkness away, and then one of 
them would sacrifice the life of the other to revive the shattered world. That fate had 
exacted a fearful toll on their minds and souls, but then they'd fallen in love with one 
another and through that had come to redeem their strange fate. "Bound by chains of 
destiny" wasn't such a scary phrase if it meant she'd inevitably be drawn together with her 
beloved, or that between lives they could share what she thought of as their own private 
corner of Heaven. Himeko didn't think it was a coincidence that it was the two lives before 
this one she could properly remember while the others were nothing more than misty dreams 
at best, because it was two lives past they'd found each other's hearts at 
last.</P><P>"Yes, although the food isn't quite as good," Chikane told her. "As for you, 
Alice, you have a bet with Saya-chan over Himeko's existence?" She arched one dark eyebrow 
at the redhead.</P><P>"Yep! You'll note, of course, that I was on your side as to whether 
she'd show up."</P><P>Chikane sighed, shaking her head, while Himeko giggled.</P><P>"Saya's 
my girlfriend, by the way," Alice explained. "We'll have to introduce you to her and to 
Arrow."</P><P>"Arrow?"</P><P>"Another friend. That's a nickname, by the way, but we all 
call her that, even Miya."</P><P>"Oh. All right."</P><P>Alice laughed.</P><P>"What, not 
even curious as to where the nickname came from?"</P><P>In truth, she was, just because it 
was kind of unusualâ€”something to do with archery, since she was one of Chikane's 
friends?â€”but Himeko hadn't thought it was her place to ask since she'd only just met Alice 
and hadn't yet met Arrow at all.</P><P>Besides which, anything other than her reunion with 
Chikane was a distant second place. She'd spent over sixteen years of her life dealing with 
things that were <I>not</I> Chikane, and she felt she had given them enough of her 
time.</P><P>Himeko caught up a tiny sausage in her chopsticks and extended it to Chikane, 
who immediately returned the favor with a piece of sweet omelet, their gazes meeting as 
they fed each other.</P><P>"Aw, how cute," Alice teased them shamelessly.</P><P>"Do you 
absolutely have to do that?" Chikane wondered.</P><P>"You know as well as I do that I'm not 
here for the introductions so much as to keep you two from ending up rolling around in the 
grass."</P><P>Himeko felt herself blush bright red at Alice's frankness, and even Chikane's 
cheeks were graced by a light pink flush. The red-haired girl had a point, too, because the 
girls were long-time loversâ€”two lifetimes' worth, and two intervals between life as well, 
in the timeless, dream-like idylls spent between rebirths in the Shrine of the Moonâ€”and 
sixteen years was a long time to do without! Himeko decided that she was very glad that 
Alice had a girlfriend, too.</P><P>She then sighed and leaned her head up against Chikane's 
shoulders, just savoring the other girl's closeness. What was the point, after all, of 
denying something that was so obviously true?</P><P>"Wow, you're the really honest type, 
aren't you?" Alice marveled. "Chikane was totally right about you; your emotions show up on 
your face the instant you feel them."</P><P>Chikane tipped her head, resting her cheek 
against Himeko's hair.</P><P>"Yes, she's always been like that."</P><P>"Okay, I'd better 
tell you right away, then. Saya and I are...well, we're pretty much in the closet about our 
relationship, except with Miya and Arrow and now you. Her family's pretty traditional and 
while we're still in school they've got a lot of power to break us up, so she wants to just 
wait until we're at least in college to reveal our relationship, since she won't be 
dependent on them then."</P><P>"That's sad," Himeko said. In their past life she and 
Chikane had had to hide their feelings, too, although that had been because they were 
sisters as opposed to just lesbians. She hadn't liked essentially having to lie, though it 
was Chikane who had been most bothered by it, probably because she'd spent so much of the 
lifetime prior to that having to stifle expressing her feelings for Himeko. "I won't say 
anything, then. Um...is your family, too...?"</P><P>Alice shook her head.</P><P>"Nah. 
Honestly, my dad'd shrug and go 'whatever,' and my mom would probably throw me a coming-out 
party. Mom was always a liberal but since we moved to Japan she'd been steadily moving even 
farther to the left, I guess as a reaction to the country being pretty 
conservative."</P><P>"I see."</P><P>Alice shot her a grin.</P><P>"Nah, you don't, but you 
will when you get to meet her. Anyway, the point's just to, y'know, keep it low-key about 
us when there's other people around."</P><P>"I will. But...um, I'm really not a very good 
liar..."</P><P>"So if you get asked directly the truth will be written all over your face?" 
Alice shrugged. "You do what you can."</P><P>Himeko sighed with relief.</P><P>"Thank you, 
Arisu-chan."</P><P>"Ah, no sweat. You gave Miya more real smiles this morning than I've 
seen out of her this past couple of months, so I owe you."</P><P>"Am I truly so difficult, 
Alice?" Chikane asked, her serene <I>ojousama</I> smile firmly in place, making the blonde 
and the redhead both laughâ€”before Himeko and Alice looked at one another, grinned, and 
broke into laughter again.</P><P>"Okay, <I>that's</I> scary," Alice wheezed. "There's 
someone else who can tell when you're making a joke, Chikane!"</P><P>"It took her a while 
to learn, but yes."</P><P>Alice shook her head.</P><P>"Reincarnated lovers...must be nice, 
particularly when you remember all the old stuff so you don't have to start from 
scratch."</P><P>"It was one of Himeko's best ideas," Chikane agreed.</P><P>The lunch bell 
chose that minute to ring, calling the students back to class. The girls scrambled to pack 
away half-finished lunches that they'd been distracted by from their talk, and were barely 
able to make it back to the classroom before Hayashiya-sensei arrived for 
trigonometry.</P><P>The rest of the day passed nearly as quickly as the morning had; if 
anything Himeko was even more distracted. The anxiety over their meeting, all the questions 
to be asked, had been replaced by a kind of dreamy hearts-and-flowers-and-rainbows haze 
that only was broken up when she was called upon. Since Himeko was at best an indifferent 
student in anything besides art, she wasn't able to cover for herself very well, even 
moving Chikane to giggles more than once.</P><P><I>Everyone must think I'm a total 
ditz</I>, Himeko thought, though it did very little to dampen her spirits. There was almost 
nothing that <I>could</I> have depressed her on Reunion With Chikane Day.</P><P>Chikane 
proved to be as popular as she'd always been; she was all but swarmed after the final bell 
with people seeking help or talking about student government or one of her various club 
activities. She handled them with her usual deftness, fending them off with the 
princess-like manner Himeko knew so well. No more than fifteen minutes had passed before 
the two of them were walking across the Academy courtyard, past the fountain and towards 
the towering staircase that led down the face of the hill, passing the lower tiers where 
the dorms and other buildings were located.</P><P>"Are you living in the dorms again?" 
Chikane asked.</P><P>Himeko shook her head.</P><P>"Mm-mmn. My family lives in town, so I 
live at home."</P><P>"I'm sorry; I haven't asked you a thing about your life up until 
now."</P><P>"Neither have I!" Himeko protested, to deflect the idea that Chikane had 
anything to reproach herself over.</P><P>"It just seemed so much more important that we're 
together now that I didn't think of anything else. But...you've been happy?" she asked with 
a hint of worry.</P><P>"Except for not having you," Himeko said. Belatedly she realized 
that it was a horribly sappy answer, like something out of a romance movie, but it was the 
truth.</P><P>"I'm sorry."</P><P>"Why?"</P><P>"I think it may have been my fault. I...when I 
chose this new world at the end of our last lives I wasn't sure how you'd react to 
me."</P><P>"Because you killed me? I thought we'd settled that."</P><P>"We did, but that 
came after. So...I think the separation was because I wasn't sure if being together was the 
right way."</P><P>"I see." Himeko thought it over, then broke into a bright smile. "Well, 
you'll just have to make it up to me. Do you know any good love 
hotels?"</P><P>"Himeko!"</P><P>The blonde giggled. She'd always been much more comfortable 
than Chikane with the physical side of their relationship, something that she consciously 
tried to emphasize. Chikane had carried a lot of guilt and shame over her desires, so 
Himeko wanted to make sure that Chikane was fully aware that she was completely comfortable 
with being the object of those desires. And if Chikane was feeling guilty over any 
responsibility she had for their separation, then it certainly couldn't hurt to give her a 
sharp reminder that Himeko wasn't holding any grudges.</P><P>Then it struck her that there 
might be another reason for Chikane's shock besides her usual reticence, a much more 
practical reason. She was, after all, a daughter of the Himemiya family, as close to 
nobility as the modern world held.</P><P>"Should I...not say things like that?" Himeko 
asked. "Would it make trouble for you if people overhear?" She'd have come out and said, 
<I>Do you want to keep our relationship a secret?</I> if that wouldn't defeat the entire 
purpose of asking. Chikane would understand, though.</P><P>And it wasn't like Himeko wasn't 
used to it. In their previous life, they'd been twin sisters, so their romance <I>had</I> 
to be kept secret since anyone who wasn't aware of their past-life history would have 
regarded them with disgust or pity. In the life before that, Chikane had even kept their 
<I>friendship</I> hidden, because...well, actually Himeko didn't really know the reason, 
though she suspected it had to do with Chikane's role as an Orochi Neck or Chikane's worry 
over having more-than-friendly feelings for Himeko or both. So if Chikane's circumstances 
were like those of Alice's girlfriend, that was all right with Himeko.</P><P>"Wait," 
Chikane said, stopping. "Are you asking meâ€”?"</P><P>"I'll let you decide, Chikane-chan. I 
don't know anyone here in Mahoroba yet, so I don't have any concerns."</P><P>Chikane 
smiled.</P><P>"You mean, you'll let me decide what I want people to think about the two of 
us?"</P><P>"Mmn!"</P><P>"All right, but if you're going to let me choose you have to 
promise that you won't have any regrets."</P><P>"Of course I won't!" Himeko rarely 
regretted anything, so it was an easy promise.</P><P>"Good."</P><P>And then, as the 
students of Ototachibana Academy streamed past them, Chikane cupped the back of Himeko's 
head and lowered her mouth to her lover's in an eager, insistent kiss.</P>
