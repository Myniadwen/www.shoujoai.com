<h1>Sins in the Moonlight (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../kannazuki/index.html">Kannazuki no Miko</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dezopengiun.html">DezoPenguin</a><br> </h2>
<P>The music that filled the club was hard and frenetic, driving the crowd of 
twentysomethings to fling their hard, young bodies about with wild, even desperate abandon. 
Some, of course, were intoxicated with alcohol or drugs, but it seemed to Tamura Hiroshi as 
if this was irrelevant, a mere gloss on the force that drove them and their sober, 
chemically speaking, companions. Their dancing did not seem to arise out of joy or passion 
or even simple lust, but rather a yearning for something just out of their grasp, a 
<I>need</I> that drove them as cruelly as a whip across their backs. And yet if asked, if 
one were able to even make them comprehend the question, none of them would have been able 
to tell what it was they craved with such overwhelming urgency.</P><P>Tamura was filled 
with mingled pity and contempt for the club patrons, just as he was for the native Hawaiian 
before him. Vincent Pukui neither looked nor acted like the dancers, but just like them he 
sought something with every fiber of his being that was nonetheless utterly beyond his 
reach. He would have said it was money and power and the material benefits those things 
would bring him that he wanted, but it was not so. Tamura knew better; what Pukui craved 
was respect, a sense of belonging. Like a feral dog in the streets he lived by fighting for 
every scrap of food, every night's safe rest, believing he wanted a full belly when he 
really wanted to run with—even lead—a proper pack. And, like the feral dog, he did not, 
could not, know that his unacknowledged dream was hopeless.</P><P>This was why Tamura found 
him so easy to manipulate.</P><P>"Here is everything you need," he said, extending an 
envelope. "The time the class is arriving, the hotel where they'll be staying, and their 
schedule for the trip."</P><P>Pukui took the envelope. He was tall and broad-shouldered, a 
powerful physical specimen that even Tamura had to respect on the level of brute force. His 
dark eyes slid from the yakuza underboss to the third man in the room, a sharp-featured 
Japanese wearing a dark sharkskin suit. He said nothing, but took out another envelope 
which he handed to Pukui.</P><P>"Your advance payment," Tamura said, "two hundred thousand 
dollars, to be split among yourself and your associates as you see fit. The other half will 
be paid upon the job's completion. More than that, you will have proven your worth to the 
Ayanokouji-<I>gumi</I>." This was, of course, a lie. A dog, no matter how well-trained, 
would never be more than a dog. If, however, it believed itself part of the family, it 
would be that much faster to defend what it thought was its pack. So too was it with this 
man.</P><P>Pukui's thumb moved towards the flap of the money envelope, as if he was about 
to take the payment out and count it. He seemed to recognize the offense this would give 
and at the last moment held back before opening the flap. At least he had <I>some</I> 
manners.</P><P>"Don't worry, Tamura-<I>san</I>," the Hawaiian said, mangling the 
pronunciation of the simple honorific. "One high-school girl? There's no way we'll have any 
trouble."</P><p style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P>The tall, beautiful girl leapt 
into the air, her body stretched out at full extension. Even on the beach at Waikiki, she 
stood out, the figure hugged by the turquoise bikini well worth a second look, as were the 
sleekly toned limbs, lovely face, and long sweep of dark hair. Her arm whipped around, and 
she let out a sharp cry as she hit the descending volleyball. It shot down across the net, 
rocketing past the boy who'd jumped to try to block her spike and hit the sand just out of 
reach of his partner's dive.</P><P>"Miya-sama!" cheered the clustered students who were 
watching their classmates' beach volleyball game. "Incredible, Miya-sama!"</P><P>There was 
one of them who was cheering something different, though. This was a girl with a slender 
figure, waist-length hair the color of the sun shining through a glass of red tea, and 
striking violet eyes. She clapped eagerly and cried out, "Way to go, 
Chikane-chan!"</P><P>The girl's name was Asamiya Hikari, but in her previous life she'd 
been the Solar Priestess of Ame no Murakumo, Kurusugawa Himeko. Since she retained all her 
memories of that turbulent, traumatic lifetime, she'd always thought of herself as Himeko, 
just as she thought of Miya-sama, her twin sister Tsukuyo, as the person <I>she</I> had 
been: Lunar Priestess and Eighth Neck of Orochi, Himemiya Chikane.</P><P>There were a 
number of old Japanese legends about how star-crossed lovers would be reborn as twins so 
that they'd never have to be parted. Himeko didn't know if that was true in general, but it 
definitely applied to herself and her twin. Himeko and Chikane had been lovers, and in 
truth they still <I>were</I> lovers, in every sense of the word. That they retained their 
past-life memories helped a lot, she thought; she was fairly certain that they'd have ended 
up that way in any case but without those memories they'd have likely taken a lot longer to 
realize their feelings and felt considerable angst and guilt over it—particularly Chikane, 
who tended towards overthinking stuff like that.</P><P>"Damn, Hikari, sometimes I think 
that sister of yours would get me to switch to your side of the fence," remarked her best 
friend, Ohgami Marika, with a wink. Marika was one of only two people who knew the real 
relationship between the twins, by virtue of having accidentally walked in on them while 
they were doing extremely unsisterly things to each other. Surprisingly, not only was she 
not weirded out by it, she actually supported Himeko in the relationship. She wasn't 
necessarily sure that she believed in past lives and resurrected priestesses, but she could 
see that being Chikane's lover made Himeko very happy and that was what counted.</P><P>It 
didn't take much to tell that Marika was an unconventional girl, anyway. Less than five 
feet tall, she nonetheless stood out in a crowd. Her hair was dyed in alternating red and 
blue stripes decorated with white stars, to celebrate their school trip to the United 
States. A swarm of thirty-four eighteen-year-olds descended upon Oahu for a week with 
bathing suits, cameras, and suntan lotion.</P><P>The two opponents in the game, a pair of 
tanned, blond Americans, walked over to Chikane and her partner, a boy named Uehara. The 
male half of the losers grinned and stuck out a hand.</P><P>"Hey, great game! Thanks a lot 
for the match."</P><P>Chikane returned the handshake without hesitation.</P><P>"Not at all; 
we had a lot of fun," she replied with only the barest trace of an accent. One of the 
advantages of past-life memories was retaining past-life education, such as the training 
the heiress of the Himemiya family had received in foreign languages. She spoke flawless 
English and French, and was adequately fluent in Cantonese and Russian besides.</P><P>There 
was a bit more chatter that Himeko didn't catch (her own language skills were extremely 
iffy), and then the four players left the court to the next pair of teams. Chikane and 
Uehara split up, Chikane walking over towards Himeko and Marika.</P><P>"Miya-sama, that was 
so awesome!" caroled a third girl who'd been standing off to Himeko's left. She rushed 
forward, handing Chikane a towel to wipe sand and sweat off with.</P><P>"Thank you, 
Himemiya-san," Chikane responded politely, accepting the towel. The irony did not escape 
either sister; the girl was <I>this</I> lifetime's Himemiya family heiress, Reiko, who 
filled the role none too well. It wasn't that she was short, slightly overweight, with 
blotchy skin and glasses. Her personality tended to be all but completely self-effacing; 
rather than being one of the class leaders, she was instead one of Chikane's most 
enthusiastic admirers. Himeko always thought it was a little sad, the way Reiko trailed 
after Chikane like a puppy, despite never breaking through the elder twin's princess-like 
mask.</P><P>Chikane mopped the sweat from her face and chest, then handed the towel back to 
Reiko; the other girl clutched it to herself like it was some kind of treasure.</P><P>"What 
was that about a party, Tsukuyo-san?" Marika asked.</P><P>"A party?" Himeko piped up. 
<I>Oh, that must have been in the English that I didn't catch.</I></P><P>"Mm-hm. Their 
class is having one tonight and wanted to know if we wanted to join them; I said that it 
sounded like fun but that we were on a plan of activities under our teachers' 
supervision."</P><P>Marika sighed.</P><P>"Yeah, probably right. Getting the whole class to 
sneak out of the hotel and back in again would have been a lot of work. And you know 
somebody would have messed it up and we'd probably get packed back to Japan or something. 
Guess we'll have to stay home and do our own partying." She nudged Himeko and winked at 
Chikane, hinting that she assumed there was another reason why the twins wouldn't be 
sneaking out to a beach party. Himeko blushed faintly but did not, in fact, argue the 
point.</P><P>"I'm a bit thirsty after all that," Chikane changed the subject. "Would anyone 
else like something to drink?"</P><P>"I would," Himeko said, and that was that. The four of 
them strolled over towards a nearby concession stand. As they did, a tall Japanese man 
wearing a white suit and sunglasses slipped from the crowd and began following them. This 
was not surprising; the man was Gin, Reiko's day-shift bodyguard. The heiress was, after 
all, a tempting target for criminals, and while her father had acceded to her request not 
to hedge her around with security he had insisted on having at least one man on guard while 
Reiko was in a foreign country. Himeko couldn't help but think that the suit must be hot 
even given its weight and color, but it was necessary under the circumstances since he was 
carrying a gun.</P><P>At the concession stand, the girls let Chikane handle the orders, 
then started digging for money in their various purses and carryalls. They walked away with 
two lemonades, a Coke, an iced tea, and a Blue Hawaii-flavored shaved ice for Marika, then 
strolled back towards the beach.</P><P>"It's so beautiful here," Himeko gushed as she 
looked out at the gleaming sands filled with eager sun-worshippers and the aquamarine 
waters sparkling in the light. "I'm glad I brought extra memory sticks for my camera; I'm 
going to need them."</P><P>Chikane nodded.</P><P>"Let's see, tomorrow is our shopping day, 
Wednesday is for museums and cultural attractions, on Thursday we go over to Maui, and 
Friday it's the beach again, on the North Shore. Saturday's our free day."</P><P>"My life 
will not be complete," Marika declared, "if I don't try surfing at least once."</P><P>"I'd 
be afraid of wiping out," Himeko said.</P><P>"Well, since I've known you to trip and fall 
while standing still, that is not an unnatural fear," Marika observed, then ate a spoonful 
of her shaved ice.</P><P>"Geez!"</P><P>"Don't worry, Himeko; I'd dive in to save you," 
Chikane said wryly.</P><P>"Aw, not you, too."</P><P>"I think our lot is to watch and cheer, 
Miya-chan," Reiko observed wisely.</P><P>"I guess so," Himeko sighed. "Darn it." She 
brightened, then, as she realized, "But I'm going to be there with my camera when you fall 
in, Marika-chan!"</P><P>"Hah! You think you can get one up on me by making me look 
ridiculous in public? I do sillier things than fall off a surfboard every 
day!"</P><P>"Well," Himeko said, grinning, "I guess you get the last word, since I can't 
argue with the truth."</P><P>"Oooh, she shoots—she scores!"</P><P>Chikane patted her on the 
head.</P><P>"Himeko brought her game today," she deadpanned.</P><P>"Aw, you guys!"</P><p 
style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P>"So, we all know what we're doing, 
right?"</P><P>Vincent Pukui's dark eyes swept across the faces of his hand-picked crew, 
three men plus himself for a total of four to carry out this job. He'd worked with them all 
before, knew he could rely on them for this commission that could be their stepping stone 
into the big time. Which wasn't to say that they weren't already experienced in violence, 
even wet work, but there was a difference between muscle jobs and being a serious 
contractor, particularly for a group with the power of the 
Ayanokouji-<I>gumi</I>.</P><P>"Yeah, Vince, we've only been over it a half-dozen times," 
drawled Cedric Carmichael. Cedric was a tanned, blond surfer boy from California who'd 
followed the waves out to Hawaii but soon found that his true talents lay in the areas of 
theft and intimidation, through which he funded his lifestyle.</P><P>"Pipe down, Keanu," 
said another of the men. "I don't want to blow my chance at a hundred grand because you 
bore easily." Rex Taggert, despite a name suited for a cowboy, was a dark-haired, 
dark-skinned man whose background was an ethnic stew of various nationalities from nearly 
every Pacific island group <I>except</I> Hawaii.</P><P>The fourth man, John 
Joseph—"Jojo"—Sakata, didn't say anything. The whiplike Japanese-American wasn't much of a 
talker. Pukui appreciated that, but his listening was going to be more valuable than his 
silence. More than likely the heiress of an international family-run conglomerate, a 
<I>zaibatsu</I>, would know English, but he doubted she'd be so obliging as to talk it with 
her school friends just because it would suit the plans of a group of criminals. Jojo was 
bilingual, having grown up in Yokohama until the age of ten.</P><P>"Right. Let's go over it 
again. Tamura's given us a three-day window, but tomorrow is our best chance. No screw-ups, 
you get me?"</P><p style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P>The hotel room was clean and 
comfortable, but nothing fancy. Chikane nevertheless loved every bit of it, from the prints 
of seascapes and hibiscus blossoms on the walls to the carpets and bedding in various 
shades of cream and beige. The décor had nothing to do with it; the only furnishings that 
mattered were that she and Himeko were on one side of a locked door and the rest of the 
world was on the other.</P><P>Being Himeko's twin sister in this life had been wonderful in 
a lot of ways. They'd been together from the very start, even before birth, scarcely more 
than a hand's reach away. There was none of the waiting, none of that yearning to fill the 
hollow place within her soul that only Himeko's presence could occupy. It was not, however, 
a one-sided blessing, particularly as their bodies had matured out of childhood into an age 
where sexuality started to be a concern. It was annoying enough to be unable to claim 
Himeko publicly as her own in the romantic sense, but the sexual logistics were appallingly 
restrictive. One could hardly, for example, take one's sister to a love hotel—not in a town 
the size of Mahoroba where there was no such thing as anonymity.</P><P>The consequences of 
being caught out, too, could be utterly ruinous. It almost seemed like some kind of miracle 
that Marika was such a good friend that she shrugged off an incestuous romance as just one 
more thing to tease Himeko about, and that her aunt had dismissed it all as being none of 
her business. Opportunities to be alone and private together were not anywhere near as 
common as they'd like them to be.</P><P>Chikane had a hotel room with Himeko for an entire 
week. As Himeko had said when they'd checked in, <I>I feel like a bride on her 
honeymoon!</I> The description was apt, and Chikane intended to enjoy herself to the 
fullest on this trip.</P><P>Thinking about that was far too distracting, Chikane thought 
ruefully. The sight of Himeko in her swimsuit on the beach had been bad enough; relatively 
modest as her lover's bikini had been, it still clung to her like a second skin, teasing 
Chikane and making her ache to embrace the other girl. Now that they were back in the 
hotel, that ache was getting worse, the unique opportunity for privacy their room afforded 
them seemed to make it impossible for her to turn her mind in other 
directions.</P><P>Himeko was in the shower now, washing off the sweat, salt, and sand from 
their beach trip. Chikane had reflexively let her go first out of kindness, but she found 
herself wishing that she hadn't. She could use a shower right about then. Preferably an 
ice-cold shower, like a plunge in purifying spring water, to force these feelings back to 
sleep. She did <I>not</I> need to be standing in the middle of a hotel room while less than 
ten feet away Himeko was under the shower nozzle, clouds of steam rising around her, 
droplets of water streaming down her roses-and-cream flesh while she worked a washcloth 
over herself, stroking her limbs and flanks with the soft cloth, rubbing in tight circles 
across her belly and breasts...</P><P><I>Damn it.</I></P><P>She felt the sudden, sharp 
clench between her thighs, the fever of arousal gone past the point where simple relaxation 
or distraction would quench it. There was only one thing that could put this fire out 
properly.</P><P>Himeko.</P><P>Chikane turned towards the bathroom door, started to move, 
then stopped before she took a single step, hesitating.</P><P>Should she?</P><P>The truth 
was, Chikane very rarely initiated their lovemaking. Her desire for her twin was so strong 
that it often threatened to overwhelm her, but she tended to shy away from acting on it 
without Himeko's invitation. Her past life had brought her too much fear, too much guilt to 
be easily washed away, and the twinge of worry that she was forcing her desires on Himeko 
woke, however fleetingly, the ghosts of when she literally had forced herself on her in a 
wild attempt to make Himeko despise her.</P><P>Himeko's unflinching, unshakable love for 
her had been Chikane's salvation, an utterly priceless gift, and she would never betray 
that again. So she often hesitated, waiting for Himeko's welcome to unfetter her desires. 
Yet, the thought of touching her sent a long, delicious shudder through Chikane.</P><P>It 
was too much to resist, too much to hold herself back. She reached behind herself and undid 
the clasp of her bikini top and let it drop to the floor, then pushed the bottom half of 
the swimsuit down over her thighs and calves, stepping out of it. Naked, she crossed the 
carpet to the bathroom door and opened it, a rush of steam from the hot shower washing over 
her.</P><P>Himeko didn't notice the momentary change in atmosphere the way Chikane would 
have; she didn't call out from behind the shower curtain. Chikane shut the door again so no 
heat was lost into the air-conditioned hotel room, then crossed the tile and the plain 
though fuzzy bath mat. She reached out, paused for just a moment, then pushed aside the 
shower curtain. Himeko was there, just as she'd fantasized, head tipped back as the hot 
water sprayed across her. A white mesh bath puff was in her hand, and she spread lather 
smelling of lilies and gardenia over herself. Chikane's legs trembled at the sight; she 
felt the muscles within her sex twitch again.</P><P><I>I want her so much.</I></P><P>She 
stepped over the rim of the tub. Himeko's eyes opened and she turned her head to look back 
towards her twin.</P><P>"Chikane-chan?"</P><P>Her tongue seemed swollen to twice its size; 
she felt breathless and clumsy. She, who as Chikane or Tsukuyo excelled at academics, 
athletics, and social interactions of all kinds, found herself nervous and stumbling. But 
then, the princess, "Miya-sama," was just a role that she played, a social space that she 
occupied, an act she put on to make her life comfortable (and, just a bit, to show off for 
Himeko, as an animal tried to make itself as attractive as possible for its chosen mate). 
Being Miya-sama didn't <I>matter</I>.</P><P>This did.</P><P><I>I love her so 
much.</I></P><P>She stretched out her hand, reaching for Himeko's and closing over the bath 
puff. She managed to smile—seductively, she thought.</P><P>"I...thought your back might 
need washing."</P><P>Himeko turned to face her.</P><P>"No, that's all right."</P><P>The 
rejection stung; Chikane almost flinched, but in the next instant Himeko stepped closer, 
slipping her arms around Chikane. She smiled, and a faint blush came into her 
cheeks.</P><P>"I'd rather you help me get dirty," she said softly.</P><P><I>How like 
Himeko</I>, Chikane thought even as relief swept through her. <I>No hesitation at all in 
acting, but embarrassed at saying so.</I> But there was no more time for thinking as she 
dipped her head so her mouth captured the shorter girl's. Himeko's lips were soft and sweet 
and she tasted them deeply in a long, loving kiss. Their mouths flowered open against one 
another and their tongues touched, darting, probing each other's mouths.</P><P>Chikane 
shivered slightly at her lover's kiss. Their bodies were slick and wet from the hot water 
cascading over them, but Himeko's fingers seemed to leave even hotter trails as they traced 
across Chikane's back, down to just above the curves of her bottom, then farther down to 
give a playful squeeze before gliding up over Chikane's thighs and flanks, then between 
their bodies, ticking her belly with delicate caresses that made Chikane shudder. All the 
while Himeko kept kissing her hotly, eagerly, making Chikane realize that her twin must 
have been as ravenous for her as she was for Himeko. What had the blonde been imagining 
while her beneath the water alone? Had she been hoping Chikane would come join her? 
Planning to seduce the dark-haired girl as soon as she emerged?</P><P>She 
wanted—needed—more of Himeko, and she pulled her mouth from her lover's. As Himeko 
whimpered in surprise, Chikane kissed across her jawline, then down her neck, swirling her 
tongue in the hollow at the base of her throat. The whimper became a moan as Himeko 
trembled against her, savoring her twin's kisses. Chikane's mouth moved to the right, out 
along the blonde's collarbone, tasting the honeyed flesh, lightly teasing it with her 
teeth. She loved to use her mouth on Himeko, to feel her lover's skin beneath her lips, to 
test the muscles beneath with her teeth and to suckle on it, branding the other girl's 
flesh with scarlet marks that visibly proclaimed, <I>she is mine</I>. Only at the last 
moment did she hold herself back from leaving any such marks, realizing that swimsuits and 
sundresses would reveal them to onlookers and raise questions neither girl was prepared to 
answer.</P><P>Himeko's hands slid up Chikane's torso, over the flat plane of her stomach to 
cup her breasts. She weighed them in her palms, feeling their fullness, lightly stroking, 
then sliding her thumbs across so that they brushed over nipples already drawn up, hard and 
swollen with need. She plucked at them, tugging between thumb and forefinger hard enough to 
be just shy of causing pain, and Chikane felt the sharp clench between her thighs as 
pleasure rushed through her. A guttural moan welled up from deep in her throat, making 
Himeko smile sensually as she recognized Chikane's response and savored it.</P><P>The 
blonde dipped her head and captured one stiff nipple between her lips. Chikane moaned again 
as her lover swirled her tongue around the areola, teasing the nipple to swell even further 
and harder.</P><P>"Ah! Himeko—" Chikane gasped even as her hand cupped the back of Himeko's 
head, urging her on. The blonde turned her by leaning up into her, pressing Chikane's back 
into the wall opposite the shower curtain. Her mouth continued to nuzzle and suck at 
Chikane's breast, while her left hand caressed the other one, using her fingers to 
duplicate what her mouth was doing, stroking, tugging, even lightly scraping with her nails 
as Himeko teased the other nipple with her teeth. Chikane's moans grew louder and more 
frequent; her breasts were extremely sensitive, but more than that her twin just knew how 
to pleasure them, what built the heat within her to a blaze.</P><P>With her free hand 
Himeko traced patterns on Chikane's body, lightly gliding fingernails over her love's skin, 
knowing the combination of the gently teasing strokes with the more direct attention being 
paid to her breasts would drive her lover wild. Her nails grazed Chikane's stomach, making 
her shiver, then past her waist and along her thighs, circling her core without ever 
touching it. The ache within her grew stronger and stronger; she could barely feel the 
water sluicing over them, her senses were so consumed with what Himeko was doing with 
her.</P><P>"Himeko, I...I need..." she whimpered, and her twin lifted her gaze to meet 
Chikane's, a devilish glint in her violet eyes.</P><P>Her hand moved between Chikane's 
legs, palm cupping her mound. Her fingers deftly spread Chikane's outer lips, but instead 
of entering her, Himeko lightly caressed along her inner lips, drawing the moment 
out.</P><P>"Himeko..."</P><P>Himeko ran her tongue slowly over Chikane's nipple with the 
same tantalizing delicacy as her fingers teased at the entrance to her lover, then drew her 
mouth back.</P><P>"Yes, Chikane-chan?"</P><P>"Himeko, I..."</P><P>"What is it, 
Chikane-chan?" she asked, somehow managing to put most of her usual sweet innocence into 
her voice, as if her fingertips weren't, even then, brushing in small, circular motions at 
the top of her slit, indirectly teasing the bud veiled beneath her lips but maddeningly 
denying what she needed so much. The smile gave her away, though, her too-honest face 
telling anyone who could see her that she knew exactly what she was doing.</P><P>Not that 
anyone ever would see, Chikane knew. Himeko saved this face for her alone.</P><P>"Touch 
me," she pleaded.</P><P>"Like this?"</P><P>A fingertip, just one, parted her lips and ran 
slowly, deliciously up the length of her.</P><P>"More..."</P><P>Again the slow caress, 
teasing a little more deeply, while the pad of her thumb continued to press just above her 
clit.</P><P>"Inside me, Himeko," she whispered. "I need you inside me."</P><P>Himeko gave 
her what she begged for, pushing a finger up inside her, sliding it into her wetness. 
Chikane shuddered as she felt herself open for her lover, felt a small cry escape her 
throat. Then Himeko's thumb parted her lips, touched the aching, taut nub there directly 
and she cried out again.</P><P>The blonde didn't tease her any longer but delivered what 
her touches had been promising, stroking into and out of her while her thumb firmly 
caressed Chikane's clit, working it. Chikane pushed her hips up against Himeko's hand, 
needing more, needing <I>her</I>. Her hand, she found, was still on the back of Himeko's 
head, and she gathered her lover's mouth to her own, spilling the mewling, gasping cries of 
pleasure her beloved drew from her into Himeko's lips. Her other hand clutched at Himeko's 
hip for support; the slick wetness of their bodies slid against one another.</P><P>Pressed 
against the wall of the bath stall as she was, Chikane felt like she was surrounded by, 
drowning in Himeko. The hunger of her mouth, the softness of her body as breasts, thighs, 
and calves rubbed together, and the insistent urging between her legs as Himeko built her 
higher and higher, drove her passion towards completion, more than passion, love. 
Priestesses, sisters, past lives, all of it was gone when they were like this together, 
just Chikane and Himeko and emotions that couldn't be put into words, only expressed on 
each other's bodies.</P><P>Chikane's vision swam; she stared blankly, seeing 
nothing.</P><P>Himeko broke the kiss long enough to whisper against Chikane's 
lips.</P><P>"<I>I love you.</I>"</P><P>A second finger joined the first, stabbing deeply 
into her core. Himeko's thumb pressed down, hard.</P><P>She was lost.</P><P>Heat exploded 
through her, filling her body, waves of pleasure surging out from her center that clenched 
down on Himeko's fingers, every muscle in her body drawing up taut as ecstasy sang along 
every nerve. Chikane screamed, singing out her joy directly into Himeko's mouth as if it 
was something the other girl could taste, swallow. Himeko's touch, so knowing, kept her 
there for a moment that seemed to stretch into forever, until at last she let her down off 
the peak and the last wave drifted away. She felt limp, exhausted, her entire body 
trembling uncontrollably as she sagged down, sliding against Himeko until she was resting 
on her knees, almost as if she was sitting <I>seiza</I> but only able to remain upright by 
clinging to Himeko's thighs with shaking hands.</P><P>Lost? No, she was 
found.</P><P>"Himeko," she murmured lovingly against the other's leg, then raised her eyes 
to meet her beloved's. Water crashed down around them, streaming across heated flesh as 
Himeko brushed her hand against Chikane's cheek; her smile was caring and tender, with just 
a trace of self-satisfaction.</P><P><I>How I love this girl.</I> Loved her for her 
childlike innocence, for her purity that shone as brightly as the sun she represented, how 
she, only she could pierce all the masks and illusions that made up Chikane's existence. 
She loved her, too, for the sides of herself that she'd only belatedly come to know, for 
her resolute spirit, a will that showed that goodness did not have to mean weakness, and 
for a love that answered her own in all ways. Feelings Chikane had believed were dark and 
ugly, a forbidden dream, Himeko had accepted, welcomed—and as she'd just shown yet again, 
returned.</P><P>"My turn," Chikane said, smiling. She meant it, too; she loved when Himeko 
pleasured her, loved the feelings and loved more the proof of Himeko's passion for her, 
left on her own body as if engraved in stone. Best of all, though, she loved to service her 
princess in turn, to make her thrill with desire, to make Himeko feel how much Chikane 
craved her, needed her.</P><P>Himeko reached down, stroking Chikane's hair.</P><P>"My love, 
my Chikane-chan."</P><P>Chikane slid her hands up Himeko's thighs, stroking the baby-soft 
skin, then urged them apart, wordlessly making her lover widen her stance, offering access. 
She raised herself slightly, so that she was eye-level with Himeko's sanctuary, the nest of 
blonde curls a shade darker, a trace more red than in the hair on her head. The lips of her 
sex were a pale pink, glistening with beads of water from the shower as well as another, 
subtler moisture, evidence that Himeko was as eager as she was. She bent forward and 
nuzzled her nose against the tangle of hair, inhaling Himeko's scent. Himeko giggled and 
leaned forward.</P><P>"Chikane-chan, that tickles! It—oh!"</P><P>Chikane had cut her off by 
sliding her tongue up the length of Himeko's slit, tasting her and drawing the first soft 
cry. She then brushed her mouth against Himeko's inner thighs, kissing and lightly biting, 
holding back so that, again, she wouldn't leave a mark. A shudder ran through Himeko, a 
trembling shiver of anticipation.</P><P>Now Chikane returned to Himeko's core, brushing 
kisses over her, nibbling softly at the outer lips, gently pinching them with her mouth. 
Himeko shuddered again, thighs trembling under Chikane's hands. She dipped the tip of her 
tongue inside, gently opening her lover, probing, then left off the teasing at last and 
took a long, deep taste of Himeko's sex.</P><P>"Ah! Chi-Chikane!"</P><P><I>Do you like 
that, Himeko? Do you like it when I taste you?</I> she thought, but couldn't pause to say 
as she wielded her tongue as deftly as she would a weapon, stroking, probing, thrusting 
within Himeko's channel, exploring her innermost secrets. Soft, mewling cries rewarded her 
efforts, as if Himeko was answering her unspoken, teasing questions. She tasted her lover's 
musky wetness, the silent evidence of the desire that she'd awakened in Himeko and savored 
it.</P><P>For long minutes Chikane continued her assault on Himeko's depths, working her 
tongue as deeply as she could, fluttering it within her, clenching at Himeko's bottom to 
help penetrate her all the better. Himeko's legs were shaking; she sagged forward, having 
to brace her hands on the shower wall to support herself. Chikane responded, sliding her 
mouth up to enclose Himeko's clit, licking it first lightly, finding it achingly hard with 
need, then more firmly, working her tongue against it while she lightly sucked. Himeko's 
breath came faster and faster, whimpering and sobbing. Her hips rocked against Chikane 
almost of their own volition, matching the pace of her lover's attentions.</P><P>Until at 
last the dam broke, and she gave a high, soaring cry that was cut off, muffled as she 
jammed a forearm against her mouth to keep from singing her ecstasy through the hotel 
walls. Chikane felt the uncontrollable tremors flow through her lover's lower belly, hips, 
and thighs, felt the fluttering of her inner walls as if shaken by the raw force of her 
emotions. She kept on flicking her tongue against Himeko's clitoris, drawing out one 
aftershock after another, until at last Himeko sagged limply to her knees and Chikane 
cradled her close, murmuring "I love you" again and again into the pink shell of her ear 
while the water stroked across their satiated embrace.</P><p style="text-align:center;">~X 
X X~</P><P>"Tomorrow, the brats go on their shopping trip. You know what that means, a lot 
of moving around as they look for souvenirs and other stuff. Everybody'll have different 
things they want, so they'll be splitting up into groups."</P><P>"So we don't have to go 
after a whole pack of kids and teachers," Cedric caught on at once.</P><P>Pukui 
nodded.</P><P>"Right—and they'll be in the outdoors for a good chunk of it, so we can make 
our move cleanly. Smash and grab instead of having to come up with some disguise or 
trick."</P><P>"Yeah, but how do we zero in on which one of them has the girl? I don't want 
to end up tailing the wrong kid all around Honolulu with nothing to show for 
it."</P><P>Pukui grinned broadly at Rex.</P><P>"Eight groups of four students each...but 
only one group that'll have a bodyguard trailing in their wake. The guy's meant to protect 
the kid from people like us, and instead he'll take us right to her."</P><p 
style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P>The sights and sounds of the International Market 
swirled around Chikane, engulfing her in its world of brilliant color and exotic scents. 
She recognized that it was an artificial creation, designed to sell goods like any ordinary 
shopping mall, but in its way it was almost like a museum all of its own, a gallery of the 
various cultures that made Hawaii into the crossroads of the Pacific. She recognized 
<I>tapa</I> cloth from Tonga, worked gold from Australia, Maori carving from New Zealand, 
more from Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, China, Japan, and of course local 
craftspeople from the Hawaiian Islands themselves. Only one nationality that customarily 
flowed through the islands was missing, that of the mainland United States.</P><P><I>Which 
probably isn't a big surprise, since Hawaii is the fiftieth state...despite its 
geographical and cultural differences.</I> Chikane remembered at the airport where a couple 
whose English had a broad midwestern twang had had patiently explained to them that no, 
they didn't need to change their dollars to "Hawaiian money" because they were still in the 
United States.</P><P>As expected, Himeko ooohed and ahhed over everything, while Marika 
tried to pick up the wildest and most outrageous things she could to bring back to her 
family and friends, and Reiko showed a surprisingly attentive eye, assessing the items for 
sale to separate the quality from the kitsch. That caught Chikane off-guard, as it sadly 
did every time Reiko displayed signs of being educated as suited the Himemiya 
heiress.</P><P>The bitter truth was that Chikane usually viewed Himemiya Reiko with a faint 
contempt on those rare occasions when she thought of her at all. It wasn't so much that 
Reiko didn't match up with the standards Chikane had set in her past life, but the way in 
which Reiko seemed to have no sense of whom she herself was. Her puppylike adoration for 
"Miya-sama" and the occasional traces of disappointment she showed at not herself 
<I>being</I> Miya-sama expressed that plainly. One only had to look at Marika to see the 
difference; Himeko's friend might have been the heiress of a wealthy, respected shrine 
family with a thousand-year history, but she was emphatically her own self rather than an 
imitation of a role model invented by someone else and it gave her an energy and 
satisfaction that Reiko utterly lacked.</P><P>Chikane found herself acting as a kind of 
interpreter for the other girls; she even got to try out her admittedly rusty Cantonese 
when Marika wanted to get a scroll painting of the Four Gods from a Hong Kong merchant 
("Aunt Minako will love it; the pictures of the gods are so ridiculously over the top it'll 
remind her why she's an atheist."). She even got into a brisk haggling match over a 
bracelet Himeko liked and managed to beat down the seller two-thirds on the price, which 
wasn't bad for someone negotiating in a foreign language.</P><p 
style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P>"I don't know," Cedric said. "Yeah, she looks the 
part all right, but the clothes are off."</P><P>"The clothes?" Jojo asked.</P><P>"Yeah, 
they're pretty ordinary. A billionaire's daughter, you figure she'd be wearing designer 
labels. Her stuff's all knockoffs. She wears them well and they're good quality, so she's 
got the eye, but the one with glasses and the one with the weird hair are wearing the real 
stuff."</P><P>"You know entirely too much about women's clothing," Jojo said.</P><P>"Long 
experience of picking it off the floor the morning after," the surfer shot back. "You ought 
to try bringing a chick home once in a while."</P><P>The Japanese man snorted.</P><P>"And 
you should try learning a second language. If you knew any Japanese, you would know that 
the two you mentioned both call the tall one 'Miya-sama.' 'Sama' is an honorific indicating 
deep respect or subservience, and Miya is obviously a shortened version of Himemiya, her 
last name. Her appearance, her manner, her poise, her facility with languages, they all 
point to what she is."</P><P>"All right, all right. Though if we just had a picture we 
wouldn't even be having this argument."</P><P>"She is, apparently, a very reclusive 
heiress, not given to publicity."</P><P>"Yeah, that's what Vince said the moneyman told 
him," Cedric sighed heavily. "Giving what they'll be asking in ransom, they ought to try 
harder. Not to mention pay <I>us</I> more."</P><P>Jojo exhaled deeply.</P><P>"It is easy to 
ask for a pie-in-the-sky ransom figure. Your fifty thousand of the advance money is hard 
currency."</P><P>"Yeah, I know—and if we don't get a move on, the big boys won't get their 
pie and we won't get our crumbs."</P><p style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P>Like any 
professional bodyguard or client of one, Gin knew that security and freedom were 
fundamental opposites, like good and evil, order and chaos, yin and yang. To gain one, the 
other inevitably had to be reduced. For Himemiya Reiko to enjoy her school trip to the 
fullest extent possible, her protection had to be sacrificed. Gin didn't like it. He was 
only one man, and he was forbidden to be close enough to her to put himself between her and 
an immediate threat. He had to stand by in a semi-overwatch position, <I>hoping</I> to spot 
any threats in time to act.</P><P>What was called for, even if a close guard was forbidden, 
was a team, a group better able to keep both Reiko and multiple areas of the environment 
under constant surveillance. Too, someone like Gin, whose loyalty to the Himemiya Financial 
Group had been tested again and again, should have been paired with someone like the night 
man, Haseo, who was a local with knowledge of the environment. <I>Learn by doing</I> was no 
way for a bodyguard to function.</P><P>Another aspect of security he'd lost via the 
arrangement was his own personal safety. His attention was on Reiko and Reiko's immediate 
environment, with his own surroundings a distant third. Thus when a Japanese man he'd have 
otherwise recognized from when he'd been within earshot of his charge a couple of 
times—often enough to be flagged "suspicious" in Gin's mind—approached not Reiko but Gin 
himself, he took the bodyguard completely by surprise. And because Gin was watching from 
the fringes of the shopping area rather than out in the open, no one noticed when a 
precisely-aimed strike to the base of the skull with the hilt of a sheathed Japanese dagger 
stole Gin's consciousness and stripped Himemiya Reiko of even his limited protection.</P><p 
style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P>"Well," Marika said as they exited the 
International Market Place out onto Kalakaua Avenue, "even if we're in a foreign country 
and an outdoor bazaar instead of a three-story megaplex, one thing remains true: turn 
Hikari and me loose in a mall and look out."</P><P>"Be fair!" Himeko laughed. "Half of 
these are Chikane-chan's."</P><P>"You didn't have to carry all those, Himeko—" Chikane 
began, but Marika cut her off.</P><P>"No way; Hikari's right: we can't have you be 
responsible for talking with everyone while juggling all those bags. Don't worry; 
Himemiya-san and I won't let her trip."</P><P>The exchange made a tide of feelings surge up 
within Chikane like a whirlpool. The way she felt about Marika was so complex, a twisted 
mixture of jealousy that she was a fixture in Himeko's life, a child's petulant whine—<I>I 
don't need any other friends, so why does she?—</I>and a deep sense of gratitude that 
Marika <I>was</I> that best friend that Himeko needed.</P><P>"Hey, if we want to give our 
arms a break, then why don't we have Himemiya-san's guard do us some good? Put that strong 
back to work instead of us straining our maidenly arms?" Marika was already rushing on to 
the next idea.</P><P>"Ohgami-san, we can't do that. Gin-san has to do his job," Reiko said 
apologetically, "or his bosses will get really mad."</P><P>Chikane blinked. Something 
seemed wrong with that statement...</P><P>Then she noticed.</P><P><I>Where was 
Gin?</I></P><P>The bodyguard had tailed the girls throughout the day, keeping them under 
observation from a discreet distance, but he wasn't there now. So where had he gotten 
to?</P><P>In the next instant, a burly, dark man with tattooed arms burst out of the 
Market. He crashed into Himeko, shouldering her aside so that she sprawled to the sidewalk, 
and in the next instant made a grab for Chikane's purse, nearly wrenching it off her 
shoulder.</P><P>Chikane reacted reflexively, pivoting so that her shoulder and hip made 
contact with the purse-snatcher's body. His outstretched arm made for a fine level, the 
reach for her purse already putting him off-balance, so she used it, ushering the man 
through a hip throw that drove him hard onto his back onto the concrete. The purse's 
shoulder strap broke under the pressure, but when the thief hit the ground it was jarred 
out of his grasp and went sliding away.</P><P>The tattooed man grunted with pain as he was 
slammed down, but Chikane wasn't done with him. Intending to make sure he didn't run off 
before the police got there, she kept hold of the purse-snatcher's arm but shifted into an 
immobilization, a painful lock that would allow her to counter and control any attempt he 
made to get up.</P><p style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P><I>Damn it to hell!</I> 
Cedric thought. The point was for Rex to grab the girl's purse and make her chase him up 
the street to where she could be bundled into the van in one quick action. But no, the girl 
had pulled a stunt out of a Hong Kong kung-fu flick and was, to put it bluntly, kicking 
Rex's ass.</P><P><I>Time</I>, he thought, <I>for Plan B.</I></P><p 
style="text-align:center;">~X X X~</P><P>Himeko pushed herself to her hands and knees. 
Marika was by her side in an instant, helping her up while Chikane was, well, being 
Chikane. It was hard, Himeko admitted, to keep from giving a fangirlish squee over her 
lover when she was doing things like taking down a thug twice her size without apparent 
trouble.</P><P>Then, suddenly, things changed. A lanky man with long, blond hair and 
wearing a loud Hawaiian shirt pointed a boxy black device at Chikane.</P><P>"Chikane-chan, 
look out!"</P><P>Her scream came too late as the man fired, not a gun, but a Taser. Two 
metal hooks, each trailing a thin wire, launched at Chikane, hitting her in the back and 
carrying their stunning voltage. She gasped as her muscular control was disrupted, back 
arching, falling onto the ground where she writhed like a landed fish.</P><P>In the next 
instant, a black van with its side door open swept up alongside the scene. Himeko could 
only stare in horror as the tattooed purse snatcher and the man with the Taser grabbed her 
twin, thrust her into the vehicle, and hopped in after her. Within less than ten seconds 
the van was pulling away from the curb, tearing Chikane away from her once again.</P>
