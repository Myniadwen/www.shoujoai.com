<p>&quot;Hikari?&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko flinched in surprise and bonked her forehead  against the window glass; she'd been staring so intently out it that  she hadn't heard Marika coming up behind her.</p>
<p>&quot;Ow,&quot; she said, rubbing the sore spot.</p>
<p>&quot;Hikari, are you all right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um, yeah. It's just a little bump.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry; I didn't mean to startle you like that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, it's my fault for being such a klutz.&quot;</p>
<p>The  girls looked at each other, stammered apologies broken off, and ended  up giggling. For Himeko, at least, it was a momentary release of  pent-up tension, but the worry settled back into place almost at once.</p>
<p>&quot;How long have you been standing here, anyway?&quot; Marika asked, seeing her expression.</p>
<p>&quot;Um...&quot;  Himeko glanced at her watch. &quot;About an hour and fifteen minutes,  maybe?&quot; At the end of the residence, the window offered a view of the  road outside the shrine. Every so often a blaze of lightning would show  the scenery in stark contrast, but there had been no gleam of  headlights piercing the rain.</p>
<p>&quot;She's going to be all right,&quot;  Marika said. &quot;I mean, hey, the whole reason Ame no Murakumo keeps  bringing her back is so she can kick Orochi ass, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko smiled at that.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,  I guess that's right. I mean, I'm not really much of a fighter. I  wonder if I was, sometime way back in lives that I don't remember, or  if there's another reason why I was chosen.&quot;</p>
<p>She turned back, resuming her post at the window, and Marika came up to stand beside her.</p>
<p>&quot;If  you ask me, it's because the god couldn't find anyone else who was  willing to put up with it all, let alone do it with a smile.&quot; Himeko  knew her friend well enough to know that she was only half joking.</p>
<p>&quot;Hikari, what's it like?&quot; Marika asked after a few minutes' silence.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Being  you. Being reborn like this, through a series of lives. Living in  different ages, different times, with nothing the same but Tsukuyo and  the fight against Orochi.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I don't really remember most of it. The only lifetime I have clear memories of is the last one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh? How come?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess...when we're reborn it's like any other reincarnated soul. People don't remember their past lives, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So it's <em>this</em> time that's different?&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;What makes it special?&quot; Marika asked.</p>
<p>&quot;I wished for it,&quot; was the answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Hikari?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I chose the world that would be remade.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yeah, you were saying something about this world being a different one than in your last life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  wanted a world where we could be together without having to find one  another, where we'd remember all that we'd gone through and how we came  to accept each other's feelings. So we remembered our past lives right  from the start, who we are and what we're meant to do. I guess that's  why we're twins, too, because my wish got turned to give us not only  mental closeness but physical closeness. And I'm glad, too!&quot; She could  feel herself blushing again. &quot;I know you like to tease us because  Chikane and I are lovers, and it bothers Chikane, too, because we have  to keep it a secret from everybody, but...&quot; She sighed happily, then  continued, &quot;But I got to be with her in this life starting from even  before we were born! We grew up together, always got to be there for  each other, never even had to spend a single day apart! I...I love her  so much, Marika. I don't really care about destiny or past lives or  being the Solar Priestess. So long as I can make her happy,  that's...that's enough...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hikari...&quot; murmured her friend.</p>
<p>Himeko wiped her eyes on her shirt sleeve.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry I'm sniffling.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's okay. She's out there fighting for your sake, right? It's natural to be worried.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,  but...it's just that it's my fault. She didn't tell me about going to  fight Reiko, so I made her promise to tell me when she was doing  something like that, so I could share in it, even if only that much. So  I can't complain about being worried, because I asked to be.&quot; She  paused for a second, then added, &quot;Marika, do you know why your dad  looked angry when Chikane was telling me about what was happening? He  looked as dark as the clouds do!&quot;</p>
<p>Marika thought it over.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Dad gets tricked by appearances with you two. He thinks Tsukuyo's the strong one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane <em>is</em> strong!&quot; Himeko leapt to her lover's defense.</p>
<p>&quot;No, she's smart, skilled, and powerful. <em>You're</em> strong. Dad figures that she's dragging you into things you're not able  to keep up with, when the truth is, she's the one who's clinging to you  out of need.&quot; She stopped as a thought hit her. &quot;That's why you wanted  to be told, right? So Tsukuyo wouldn't be alone?&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh-huh.  I can't help her fight, but at least I can let her know that she has  someone cheering her on.&quot; Another bolt of lightning startled her; she'd  kind of forgotten about the storm while they talked. &quot;How do you know  so much about us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, I haven't been your best friend since we  met for nothing. You probably pick up on all kinds of stuff about me  that nobody else knows. Well, maybe not, but that's just 'cause you're  a ditz.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko giggled.</p>
<p>&quot;Imp!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, probably, but--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?  Oh,&quot; Marika realized belatedly that the beams of two headlights could  be seen--barely--forging their way up the road. By the time she  comprehended what was happening, she was a good four or five steps  behind Himeko. The blonde ran back up the hall and out onto the  veranda. The driving rain rattled off the roof above her and hissed on  the courtyard flagstones, but she barely noticed it, instead watching  the headlights pull aside into the garage. The storm drowned out the  engine, so she couldn't tell when it was turned off, nor could she hear  the garage door closing, but she saw the flicker of white that was  Chikane's kimono jacket and heedless of the rain she dashed off the  porch and ran down to meet her.</p>
<p>They reached each other just about the time when Chikane passed beneath the <em>torii</em> marking the shrine's boundary.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane?  Chikane, are you all right?&quot; Himeko asked nervously, because it was  clear that her lover was not all right. Her head hung, her steps were  slow, and her vestments bore several tears and dark stains. &quot;Here, let  me help you!&quot;</p>
<p>She put an arm around Chikane's waist while her  sister draped hers over Himeko's shoulder. This close, it was clear  that Chikane was soaked to the skin and that the car's heater had done  very little if anything to dry her. Chilled, she was shivering against  Himeko's side.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm all right,&quot; she managed to say. &quot;It was only  a few nicks and cuts, nothing more. I'm just...tired. I killed the  Fifth Neck before he could do anything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's great!&quot;</p>
<p>A faint smile graced Chikane's lips.</p>
<p>&quot;So bloodthirsty...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Geez!&quot;  Then Himeko smiled, too, because if Chikane was able to make jokes,  even such a little one, it meant that she was mostly all right.</p>
<p>Marika came running up to them as they entered the courtyard.</p>
<p>&quot;Is she--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mostly, but she's really cold. Can you get a hot bath ready for her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I'll get it started right away, and get out some dry clothes for her. You can take care of her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mmn-hm,&quot; Himeko answered, nodding.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay.&quot;</p>
<p>Marika  scampered off. Himeko and Chikane made their way across the courtyard  to the residence, removed their footwear, and dripped down the hall to  the bathroom. Marika had started filling the tub with steaming hot  water and had set out a stack of fluffy towels as well as the  washbasin, soap, and shampoo.</p>
<p>&quot;That should do it,&quot; she said. &quot;My  robe is hanging up on the hook behind the door; I know it's too short  for Tsukuyo but it should get you decently down the hall. Your clothes  from yesterday, the ones you left behind when you changed for the  ritual, have been washed and they're laid out for you in my bedroom.  I'd bring them here after you've had a chance to get warmed up, but  I've learned my lesson about walking in on the two of you in the bath,&quot;  she added with a wink.</p>
<p>Himeko blushed at the memory, but still thanked Marika for her help.</p>
<p>&quot;No prob. I'm just glad you got home safe, Tsukuyo.&quot; She slid the door shut behind her, leaving the sisters alone.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay!&quot;  Himeko said. &quot;Let's get you out of those wet things.&quot; She stripped the  soaked vestments off Chikane, then made the other girl sit on the bath  stool while briskly toweling her dry. She was glad to see that Chikane  had told the truth; she had a few nicks and slashes, one on her cheek,  one on her left shoulder, and one each on her right side and thigh, but  each one was both shallow and clean. As a priestess she wouldn't have  an Orochi's regeneration power, but it would still speed up her natural  healing and slow the effects of more serious injuries. There were also  a couple of bruises forming, which Himeko gingerly brushed her  fingertips against, but all in all she decided that Chikane had been  truthful in saying that she was basically all right. Wetness, cold,  emotion, the exertion of battle, and the fading of her adrenalin rush  had combined to leave her drained and tired, but that was all. The  relief that swelled within Himeko at the thought was more warming than  the steam filling the room.</p>
<p>While they waited for the tub to  fill, Himeko sluiced hot water over Chikane, then worked up a lather of  rose-scented bath gel in a mesh puff and started to wash the  dark-haired girl. She'd always thought that it was fun to wait on  Chikane like this; there was just something nice about taking care of  her lover and making her feel better. Chikane let out a long, satisfied  sigh as Himeko massaged sweat and oil, dried mud, grass, and crusted  blood from her body.</p>
<p>&quot;That feels really good, Himeko.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm  glad I could at least do this much,&quot; she said happily. She rinsed the  soap off, then went over and turned off the taps, since the tub was  full. &quot;Are you feeling a little warmer now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  tested Chikane's skin with her hand in a couple of places; she was  definitely warmer than she had been when soaked from the rain.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd  wash your hair, too, but I think it's more important to get you into  the tub,&quot; the blonde decided. She piled the blue-black glory of her  beloved's hair up in a simple bun and used a washcloth to tie it in  place so it wouldn't get into the bath water, then helped the other  girl into the tub. Chikane sank down deeply into the steaming water  with a blissful sigh.</p>
<p>&quot;Would you join me?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, but wouldn't Marika get mad?&quot; Himeko murmured, and Chikane laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;Not for that, Himeko!&quot; she said, giggling. &quot;You're so single-minded.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  might have been horribly embarrassed at being caught out that way, but  seeing Chikane laugh and smile made her so happy that she forgot all  about it.</p>
<p>&quot;You love a good round of princess-and-handmaiden as  much as I do, Chikane,&quot; she teased back, and got to see her lover  squirm. &quot;But I'll be glad to get in.&quot;</p>
<p>She took off her own  clothes and began to wash herself while Chikane leaned back in the tub  and let the warmth seep into her tired body. While Himeko hadn't been  out fighting, staying the night at the hospital had prevented her from  taking a shower, so it felt good to get clean. Since unlike her twin  she didn't bother with separate shampoo and conditioner she took the  chance to wash her hair, too, removing her ribbon and working up a good  lather. She wished she'd had the chance to do the same for Chikane; she  loved the feel of her lover's hair, the silken weight of it in her  hands.</p>
<p>When she was done, she rinsed off, then wrapped up her own  hair and walked over to the tub. Chikane watched her the whole way, not  with desire but a tenderness in her gaze. Himeko stepped in, letting  her body sink into the warmth, and leaned back against Chikane as her  beloved's arms came up around her.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; Chikane said.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't  be silly! It feels really good! And besides, I don't ever need an  excuse to let you hold me.&quot; Her head rested against Chikane's shoulder  so that their faces touched cheek to cheek. &quot;I love you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I love you, too.&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko  covered Chikane's hands with her own and savored the closeness. She  always felt so safe and secure when Chikane held her, like there was  nothing on earth that could hurt her. She hoped that it worked the  other way, too, though she supposed that a warrior as fierce as Chikane  wouldn't see &quot;protected&quot; as meaning the same thing.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, Himeko,&quot; Chikane said lazily, &quot;do you remember the first time we did this, took a bath together?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In our previous lives, you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's right.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,  wow, that was such an incredible bath! You can't even call it a bath;  it was like an indoor hot spring, with the rocks and all the tropical  plants everywhere.&quot; Himeko sailed off into memory, then suddenly  stiffened.</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aw, I can't believe that I was so  stupid. You even did the 'we're both women; there's nothing to be  embarrassed about' bit just like in one of my yuri manga! I missed a  really good chance! Though maybe I did notice a little bit; I thought  that you were reaching...well, for <em>me</em>...when you touched my sun  mark. I was even gathering my courage, thinking 'but if it's Chikane,  it's okay...' and things like that. Did you get nervous and stop at the  last second?&quot;</p>
<p>Pink flushed Chikane's cheeks.</p>
<p>&quot;Um...yes, I did. I was flirting a little, though I didn't really expect a response.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish I could go back to then.&quot; Himeko giggled and explained, &quot;I bet your eyes would go as wide as saucers!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I definitely would have panicked.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You'd have totally freaked out! It would have been so cute!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If people could hear you now, it would completely destroy your 'sweet and innocent' image.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You  know I don't care about that. I just want to make you happy, and the  best way I've found to do that is to be completely honest about my  feelings for you, even the embarrassing ones.&quot;</p>
<p>She swallowed  nervously, then, because 'complete honesty' meant something else, too.  The promise she'd made to herself in the hospital yesterday had been  pushed aside more than once by the ordinary course of events, by things  it hadn't been easy to predict, but it had to be faced.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane...&quot; she said hesitantly.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; her twin replied, the laughter gone from her voice. She could tell at once that Himeko had grown serious.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't really talked about it...what it means that I'm no longer the Solar Priestess.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's  nothing to talk about,&quot; Chikane said at once. &quot;We still have no idea  why it happened, or who the new priestess is--or even if there <em>is</em> a new priestess. All we'd be doing is guessing, so there's no point in saying any more about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot; Himeko all but cried. &quot;That's not what I'm talking about!&quot; Chikane flinched at her sudden vehemence. &quot;I mean about <em>us</em>. About what's going to happen with the ritual of revival.&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane went stiff.</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko, this isn't--&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko half-turned onto her side so she could look at Chikane directly.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; she said again, &quot;this is too important to leave unsaid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do  you think I want to say it? Do you think that I want to talk about how  we're going to be parted forever? That these few days may be all we  have together, and that when they're through you might not even  remember me? I could... I could barely make myself face it at <em>all</em>,  Himeko, let alone waste what little is left to us...&quot; Unable to  restrain herself any longer, she lashed out, cracking her fist against  the side of the tub.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane!&quot; <em>She was thinking </em>that<em>? No wonder she's been so moody!</em> The reason she'd been so insistent on Himeko joining her for the  unsealing rite, why she'd acted as she did at the hospital and in  fighting Reiko, it was all because of this. Himeko felt her eyes begin  to brim over with tears and she flung her arms around her beloved,  holding her tight. &quot;Oh, Chikane, no, that can't be right!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How  can it be anything else? The priestesses are reborn together, two miko  sharing one lifetime for the purpose of defeating Yamata no Orochi.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  the one who performs the sacrifice is restored to life along with the  world, which means that you would come back to me. We could...we could  finally live out our lives together in this world, without having to  lose each other!&quot;</p>
<p>Chikane's eyes lit with hope for a brief instant, but that promise died out almost at once.</p>
<p>&quot;And then what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And  when that life is done, then what? Not even the chance to live together  with you, to grow old and have happy lives is worth losing you after  that, stepping into an eternity apart from you!&quot; Convulsively, her arms  wrapped around Himeko, clinging fiercely to her. Chikane buried her  face in the crook between Himeko's neck and shoulder and sobbed out,  &quot;If it's for you, I can bear anything, can <em>do</em> anything, but if  I lose you...&quot; Himeko's skin was wet from the bath water, but she could  still feel the hot moisture of Chikane's tears trickling out over it.  Chikane's sobs poured from her, long and loud and positively <em>terrifying</em>. Himeko clung to her sister desperately, wanting to do <em>something</em> and unable to imagine what might possibly help under these circumstances.</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane...&quot;  She stroked her sister's back gently, trying to soothe her. There was  only so much she could do, though, when she hadn't even started to  think of all the bad things their circumstances might mean. She'd only  thought of what it meant in this life! As usual, Chikane's mind had  proceeded further, exploring possibilities and consequences--and again  had tried to bear the burden of that knowledge alone.</p>
<p>&quot;No! I  won't believe it!&quot; Himeko cried out. &quot;Even if destiny doesn't force us  together, it doesn't matter! I love you because you're Chikane, not  because I am or am not Solar Priestess. That isn't meaningless! I don't  care what kind of battles you have to fight or what kind of world takes  shape, I'll always find you there. I don't care if we lose our memories  or what kind of lives will lead, I'll always, always, always be your  very own Himeko.&quot; She managed a game smile. &quot;I'll just have to work a  little harder to find you, that's all. But I will, I know I will. It's  a promise!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko!&quot;</p>
<p>Himeko pushed Chikane back a bit so  she could look at her, immediately cradling her twin's face in her  hands both so that she could hold her still and to reassure her that  the broken embrace wasn't some kind of rejection.</p>
<p>&quot;How...how can you promise something like that?&quot; Chikane half-sobbed, half-wailed. Tears streamed down her face.</p>
<p>&quot;Because I love you!&quot; Oh, why couldn't she find the <em>words</em>? &quot;I do! Worlds and lifetimes don't matter; our souls are drawn together and nothing can ever keep us apart!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You really...believe that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,  yes!&quot; She pressed urgent kisses against Chikane's cheeks, blotting out  the tears. &quot;I don't want to live without you, either. I won't accept a  world without you, no matter what. So let me be a little selfish,  okay?&quot; She kissed Chikane again, on her lips this time. &quot;Please?&quot;</p>
<p>A massive shudder ran through Chikane's body and her eyelids drooped.</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko...You  almost make me believe it,&quot; she said softly, her voice choked. She  covered Himeko's hands with her own, squeezing. &quot;Your love is so  relentless; you make it a force that can break down any obstacle or  barrier. Even if it means being cursed by the gods, I'll go on  believing in you to the depths of my soul.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good! Because I know I can stand anything, endure any suffering if it's a path that brings me back to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Himeko!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chikane...&quot;</p>
<p>Then Chikane kissed her, clinging to her again, and for a long time there were no more words.</p>
<p align="center">-X X X-</p>
<p>The  dark sun was wild and seething, pulsing with emotion. Lightning surged  in the clouds above the shrine, thunder a throbbing drumbeat to match  the emotion of the eye of Orochi. The skies over Mahoroba had cleared  with the coming of dawn, but the disciples of eternal night were still  shrouded in storm.</p>
<p>&quot;I would be angry, too,&quot; Saori reflected  aloud, looking up. &quot;What have we managed to do in Orochi's name? Our  only productive act was to identify just how badly we've been screwed.  Against that the Lunar Priestess is still running loose despite three  attempts on her life, the Solar Priestess remains nowhere to be found,  our leader is a shell of herself, and we're so given to squabbling that  nearly half of us can't be bothered to show up.&quot;</p>
<p>Her point was  even more valid than she knew, Ozawa thought. Only five of the gates  were occupied if one counted Reiko, which the former soldier did not.  The catatonic wreckage of a woman that had been the First Neck was as  useless to Orochi's goals as were the dead.</p>
<p>&quot;We are losing this war,&quot; he stated.</p>
<p>&quot;Y'know,  I can see that weasel Fifth backing out,&quot; Kei said. &quot;I mean, he pretty  much told us all to shove it the last time he was here. But the holy  roller? That's way out of character. He ought to be here, screaming at  us for how badly we've failed the 'Will of Yamata no Orochi' or however  he put it. It's been nearly two days since we've seen his pitiful mug.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dead.&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone  flinched at the unnatural voice, as loud as normal speech but with the  hollow, rasping tones of a whisper. Four heads turned towards Reiko's <em>torii</em> to see that the slumped figure had raised her head. With wide,  unfocused eyes, pupils so dilated that they nearly swallowed the irises  wholly, set in a blood-streaked face she looked more like a ghostly  horror than a girl. Even Ozawa found himself unnerved by the spectacle.</p>
<p>&quot;W-what do you mean?&quot; Saori stammered.</p>
<p>There  was a long pause, as if the girl wasn't quite capable of understanding  her without a delay to process the words. Then Reiko's mouth opened and  an answer came, not so much spoken as breathed forth.</p>
<p>&quot;The Third Neck has fallen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My God!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No way,&quot; Kei snapped.</p>
<p>&quot;It's true,&quot; Ozawa said. &quot;It was on, of all places, the television news. His body was found by the police.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did <em>she</em> know?&quot; Akemi asked, indicating Reiko. She then glanced at Ozawa, who nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;She'd know if she was the one who killed him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait one damn minute, Seventh. She was with me when the Third did his disappearing act!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Treachery!&quot; Reiko cried out as if injured.</p>
<p>&quot;As she says,&quot; Ozawa stated.</p>
<p>&quot;There's  no way you're pinning this on me, you stiff-necked bastard!&quot; Kei  roared. &quot;What about the Fifth? He's playing least-in-sight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The  Fifth Neck has fallen.&quot; Reiko's strange, keening voice echoed out above  them all. Even Kei's head snapped back around towards her.</p>
<p>&quot;What, him too?&quot;</p>
<p>No more answers were forthcoming from her; she crumpled back to her gate.</p>
<p>&quot;It isn't knowledge,&quot; Akemi suddenly realized. &quot;At least, it isn't <em>her</em> knowledge. When that...that <em>monster</em> did this to her, it broke her will. She couldn't accept the trauma, so she retreated inside herself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot;  Saori exclaimed, understanding. &quot;It left her open to the will of  Orochi. Our connection to it is weak, since we bear only Shadows of its  power, but Take no Sukunazuchi doesn't have to bypass a human will.  Orochi's voice is speaking to her subconscious the way it could commune  with Abe.&quot;</p>
<p>Ozawa tugged at his earlobe, thinking. It was a  plausible suggestion, and a reasonable alternative for Reiko's being  responsible for Abe's death--which as Kei had been quick to recognize,  would implicate the Second Neck in addition to the First.</p>
<p>&quot;Yo,  you want to point fingers, how about the Eighth Neck? I don't know  about you, but if I'm going to suspect any one of us of being a  backstabbing traitor it's going to be the guy who never showed up in  the first place.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have a point,&quot; Ozawa granted.</p>
<p>&quot;Two dead, one missing, and one like...<em>that</em>,&quot; Saori enumerated their losses, waving a hand towards Reiko.</p>
<p>&quot;This is what comes of not acting in concert,&quot; Ozawa said.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't hear you objecting to a lot of those failures you're whining about now, old man.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  made foolish assumptions about the way things would work as Orochi. It  is painfully clear now, however, that being avatars of the gods of  destruction does not change the need for organization, planning, and  concerted effort. I believed that Reiko had begun to understand that,  but then she went off on her own once more and you see the result.&quot;</p>
<p>He clenched a hand into a fist, the anger mounting within him.</p>
<p>&quot;We  have a real chance to accomplish something, to wipe this blight-ridden  world off the map forever. Whatever enemies gather against us, one  thing is clear: it is our first duty to destroy the priestesses! This  task was given to us when the voice of Orochi called us, at the very  beginning. We have tried fighting her one-on-one and failed. We have  tried increasing our power so that we <em>could</em> defeat her one-on-one and also failed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you think you have a better idea, soldier-boy?&quot;</p>
<p>Ozawa's  Shadow manifested in that instant, darkness sheathing his entire body  like a samurai's armor, called forth by his mounting emotions.  Blue-green fire played along his fists, and even Kei flinched in  response.</p>
<p>&quot;Basic <em>military</em> strategy. This is no tournament, not some kind of competition. This is a war to impose the will of Orochi, <em>our</em> will, on this world. The Lunar Priestess may well be a match for any  one of us. Her new power may make her invincible in single combat. What  of it? We shall <em>all</em> descend on her and crush her with our full  force as we should have done from the start. When she is dead, we can  worry about other matters.&quot;</p>
<p>His gaze ripped over the three of them, even Akemi.</p>
<p>&quot;And if there is any attempted betrayal, I swear that it will end <em>very</em> badly for you.&quot;</p>

<p><em>A/N:  The &quot;first bath together&quot; that they discuss is the scene from the  manga, Vol. 1, starting on page 78. Himeko liking yuri manga comes from  the Drama CD, which technically takes place in the anime continuity  rather than the manga, but I figured that manga-Himeko wouldn't be any </em>less<em> of a yuri fan than anime-Himeko...and Hikari-Himeko </em>definitely<em> would like yuri! </em></p>
<p><em>Some  of you might be wondering at how easily Himeko consigned the  hypothetical Solar Priestess who we haven't yet met to the &quot;gets  killed&quot; role--a more selfish thought than one would necessarily  associate with her. On the other hand, she's really the only person  who's actually capable of saying whether getting consigned to the Lunar  Shrine for the interval between cycles is truly an Awful Fate. Frankly,  she takes it a lot better than Chikane takes to </em>not<em> getting stuck there, so...</em></p>
