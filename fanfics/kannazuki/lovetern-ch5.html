<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>Yukihito
was walking on a street in Downtown when he stopped short in front of an empty
alley. Its ground was littered with empty soda cans, its walls with dirty
graffiti... and what seemed to be stains of blood. Under the crimson light of
the setting sun, this little alley, a typical gathering place for shady people,
looked so ominous that all who had an ounce of sense would depart immediately
and never look back. Still, the façade was deceptive. Yukihito doubted anyone
would suspect that within those walls and empty space stood elaborate Wards and
Barriers made to conceal whatever happened inside and scare away uninvited
guests? Yukihito truly had to comment the person who laid those spells. Such an
immensely powerful Spirit Field, yet its presence was cloaked so deftly that
even a God would have little chance in noticing its existence. He would have
applauded that person, too, had both of his hands not occupied by the books
that the Shingetsu High Priest asked him to fetch from a nearby bookstore.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>But was it not strange that something like this was here, of
all the places? Spells of this caliber were certainly not woven by a mortal.
Yukihito did not even think that half of the Gods and Goddesses in Izumo knew
how to set those up, let alone combining them together to such degree of
perfection. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Puzzling, quite
puzzling indeed. </span></i>Yukihito cocked an eyebrow at the alley in sheer
curiosity. This had to be the work of an ancient being of enormous powers, most
likely from the Underworld. In that case.... Yukihito’s eyes went wide. <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Could it be her?</span></i> His fists
clenched at the thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>It very bloody well <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>could</span></i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>All of a sudden, two shadowy figures emerged from the alley
and bumped into his front. Pretending to lose his balance, he dropped the two
plastic bags he was carrying in his hands. As a result, books spilled on to the
ground while he himself landed on his bottom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Ouch,” Yukihito groaned in feigned agony.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Our deepest apologies. Are you alright, sir?” Two girls,
outwardly identical, were standing there, peering down at him, blank faces
betraying no emotion whatsoever. With a look their long raven-haired framing
their more than pretty faces and at the expensive one piece dress elegantly
gracing each of their bodies, most people would be certain they were Ojou-sama
from a noble House... but Yukihito knew better than that. The twins were <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Immortals</span></i>, each possessing
such an abundance of celestial powers that they could make a God from Izumo
seem weak as an insect. Their strengths were only one step below that of
Tsukiyomi the Goddess of the Moon herself!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“No, I am the one who must apologize.” Yukihito collected the
books with the help of the two and rose awkwardly to his feet. “It was my fault
for standing in a daze. But who could have thought such graceful ladies like
yourselves would come out of a dirty alley?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Why, you are most kind, sir,” spoke the
Immortals-in-disguise in unison. Even their voices were the same. “But please
excuse us. We have matters to attend to.” They gave him a slight bow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Then have a good day.” Yukihito inclined his head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Yukihito turned and walked away. As soon as he could get to
somewhere alone, he would notify Heaven and the Holy Messengers. He needed to
know what the damned woman planned to do with the Human World. Yukihito hated
surprises, and <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>she</span></i>
was specialized in delivering most unpleasant ones when least expected. But
this time, he was prepared. This time, she would never be able to catch him
unguarded. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Wait and see,
woman,</span></i> he thought angrily,<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>
what you dealt me once, I shall return ten-fold!</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;
margin-bottom:.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:center'>***</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>“Your
thoughts, Fuyura?” Tsukazaki Haruhi said once they got out of the young man’s
earshot. If someone laid eyes upon the sisters at the moment, all they were
going to see would be two young women walking upon the rowdy streets of
Mahoroba, leisurely and without a care in the world. They would never know that
the twins were deploying all of their powers of perception, which in turn
formed an undetectable field of external vision about themselves. As soon as
someone with the tiniest spark of power got within two hundred feet of the
twins, they would know it immediately. It might seem overkill to do such a
thing in Onogoro, where the number of magisters had been dwindling over the
centuries, but after the unexpected encounter with the intriguing young man,
Haruhi believed extra caution was by no means needless.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“He’s suspicious, Haruhi,” her sister answered, her powers
resonating with Haruhi’s in a faint but endless rhythm. As long as they were at
each other’s side, joined in heart and strength, very few people in the Three
Worlds could harm a strand of hair on either’s head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Yes, he said <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>dirty
alley</span></i>, did he not?” Haruhi nodded. “A slip of the tongue,
undoubtedly. A mortal is not supposed to even <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>see</span></i>
the alley itself. Definitely suspicious.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“A spy from Izumo?” Fuyura said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I would think so,” Haruhi agreed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Then I shall find out what he is up to,” the other woman
murmured. She would have spun on her heel and walked in the opposite direction,
too, had Haruhi not taken her hand and dragged her along by force. Her sister’s
lips thinned in irritation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Do not be reckless, Fuyura,” Haruhi told her little sister. “Whatever
he may be, the man is strong. He could see through the warding, and he
concealed his powers so well that I sensed nothing from him at all. Pursuing a
foe whose strength we cannot fathom is a disaster waiting to happen, why can
you not see that?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'> “Then we are going to let him slip away just like that?”
Fuyura muttered impatiently. “You do realize we must not let Izumo get a whiff
of this, do you not, Haruhi?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I never said that I would leave that man run free in
Onogoro, unchecked,” Haruhi answered in a wry tone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Then why did you stop me?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Because there are people more suitable for the job, dummy.”
She knuckled her sister playfully on her forehead. “Do you claim to possess
more talent in spying on people than the personnel of the Intelligence Service?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Oh,” was Fuyura’s only reply, accompanied by a few surprised
blinks and an embarrassed gust of laughter. It would seem that she never
remembered the existence of the Service, which, supposedly, was one of the
departments under <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>her</span></i>
jurisdiction. Haruhi only shook her head and sighed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“So, will you ask <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>your</span></i>
people to do something about that young man, now?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You need not tell me that.” Fuyura’s hand rose and pulled a
PDA out of thin air. She then started to use her electronic pen, created in the
same fashion, to scribble hurriedly on the LCD, meanwhile oblivious to the
grimace Haruhi sent her way. Why did her twin sister not realize that they were
<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>walking</span></i> upon a
street full of people, who could have noticed what she had done and raised a
fuss about it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'> “Done,” announced a pleased-looking Fuyura, who just let the
PDA and the pen melt back into thin air. “What, why are you staring at me?”
They both had stopped in front of a bakery shop, the storefront of which
displayed a multitude of cakes of various colors and shapes and sizes. Near the
entrance, behind a table, stood a teenaged girl who was calling and handing out
samples to passers-by, who were swarming around her in a rapidly growing crowd.
The cakes might actually be tasty, but Haruhi was willing to wager that it was
the girl’s voluptuous body that drew in the customers, most of which were men
whose eyes were fixing at her scantily covered curves. The manager of the shop
knew how to do business, Haruhi supposed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Will you just tell me what has been going with you already,
Fuyura?” Haruhi said in a soft voice. “I cannot help you if you refuse to speak
up, you know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“What do you mean?” Fuyura seemed interested in the pavement
all of a sudden. Still, she could not hide the fact that her face had gotten
quite flushed. Haruhi frowned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Haruhi and Fuyura were identical twins, and as such, they had
<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>almost</span></i> <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>everything</span></i> in common. Their
personalities, their tastes in food, their habits, and even the way they
schemed were but the same. That was why it was effortless for Haruhi to notice
when her sister started acting strange. Fuyura, the acclaimed <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>precision machine</span></i> in the
Underworld, had been making numerous mistakes during the last few weeks. She
was constantly in such a sour, short-tempered mood that she could barely focus
her attention on matters at hand. As a result, the young lady mixed up
documents, misallocated budgets, and even fell down the same stairs... twice...
in a row.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Haruhi really did not get it. Her sister was in prime
condition three weeks ago, before Haruhi left for Onogoro alone on a secret
mission. Upon Haruhi’s return a day later, she found Fuyura already a mess. Her
office, once clean and tidy enough to please any janitor, was buried in
mountains of unfinished paperwork. Her raven hair, always falling in a straight
stream all the way to her waist, looked unwashed and was tangled in what seemed
like a bird’s nest. Haruhi had had to clean up the office and drag her sister
to the bathroom herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Once done with that unpleasant task – Fuyura fought every
step of the way – Haruhi had attempted to learn what had happened during her
absence from the Underworld. She failed miserably. Her colleagues either did
not know, or decided not to tell her. Even Haruhi’s <i><span style='font-family:
"Footlight MT Light"'>liege lady</span></i> changed the topic when asked, due
to reasons that Haruhi failed to comprehend. And as if that was not bad enough,
Fuyura kept being tight-mouthed as a mussel when Haruhi confronted her. She
exasperated Haruhi no end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You know what I mean, Fuyura, you....”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Look, Haruhi, do you not think they have really
tasty-looking cakes over there?” her sister clamored all of a sudden while
gesturing excitedly at the bakery shop. “Wait here, I will get some.” Not
waiting for Haruhi’s assent, Fuyura walked hurriedly toward the girl who was
handing out samples. Haruhi could only groaned in frustration at her sister’s
blatant attempt of avoiding the question. Maybe Haruhi would have to tie her
down first....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Bored and somewhat irritated, Haruhi watched in silence as
the crowd of customers slowly parted ways to allow Fuyura’s access to the sale
assistant in the middle. The men, who were speaking excitedly to the scantily
clad girl a second before, now gawked openly at Haruhi’s twin sister as their
mouths clamped shut in what seemed to be amazement. Some of them even had the
nerve to call out to the young woman and would have attempted to touch her
shoulder had she not given them a stare that would turn their internal organs
to ice. Haruhi chuckled quietly to herself. The men’s behavior did not surprise
her. They had never been famous for their ability to resist pretty women,
anyway. She was amused, however, because the sale assistant, with the virtue of
being also a girl, was not faring better than her customers, at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Leaning her back against a lamppost, Haruhi could not help
but grin at the scandalously dressed sale assistant, who was blushing furiously
at the raven-haired young woman who had just unexpectedly shown up at her
table. The teenager, who had been quite professional in her job the way she
juggled the people in the crowd without letting an inch of her body be touched,
now could not seem to find her voice while her eyes glued dead at Fuyura’s
pretty face. The other people surrounding the two might as well never exist.
Only until Haruhi’s twin sister asked for a sample on the table did the girl
snap out of her day dream. She then hurriedly looked at the remaining pieces on
the table and finally gave Fuyura what Haruhi thought to be the most
delicious-looking sample. When Fuyura’s fingertips accidentally brushed over
the girl’s palm, she turned a deep shade of scarlet. Even after the
raven-haired woman had walked into the shop – Haruhi’s sister liked what she
tasted, undoubtedly – the teenager still peered through the glass door and
watched as though unable to take her eyes away. Luckily, her customers were
busy doing the same thing, too, so they did not notice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Then the truth slapped Haruhi across her face. When Fuyura
came back, holding a beautifully decorated box in her hands, she found her
elder sister overwhelmed by an uncontrollable fit of laughter. How could Haruhi
not be, really, when she finally understood the cause to Fuyura’s recent
unusual behaviors? She could not believe she had been so <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>blind</span></i>. The signs had been
there ever since the beginning, when the twins sought employment in the
Underworld! She laughed even harder. Finally, she had found <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>one thing </span></i>that she did not
share with her sister. Who could have believed this...?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“What is so funny?” Fuyura eyed Haruhi curiously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“It is a secret, little sister,” she answered while her hand
wiped a tear from the corners of her eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Tell me,” Fuyura demanded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Only if you do the same and tell me what has been bugging
you lately.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>That shut Haruhi’s little sister up. The young woman, whose
lips thinned into a straight line in indignation, decided to ignore her elder
sister and stride forward. Chuckling softly, Haruhi caught up to the younger
woman and walked arm in arm with her on the road that she knew to be leading
toward Mahoroba City Amusement Park.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“What is it, Fuyura?” Haruhi asked when her sister suddenly

Souma couldn’t help but chuckle. Of course, his blood brother was still

blasted into the sky just to be slammed down merciless afterwards. They never
stood up again. Souma resisted the urge to buckle down and empty his stomach.

drowned by the panicking cries of the people. Amidst all the chaos and

Lord resides. There you shall ask for his forgiveness and pledge your

moment there, he had thought he could reunite with Tsubasa-nii-san, for a

emotionless, whose platinum air was not moving in the night winds, and whose
gray eyes were as dull as those of the dead. Yet, Himeko guessed the strangest
thing about the girl was that the stream of panicking people parted <i><span

date with her long lost childhood friend, her knight in shining armor, seem so
upset?</span></i></p>

have anything else to say to me, Chikane-chan?” the little angel said quietly,
her beautiful amethyst eyes locking at Chikane’s sapphire. The girl seemed

of yourself,” was all Chikane could come up with. As far as she was concerned,
it was not what Himeko had wanted to hear, for the girls face had taken on a
shade of dejection as soon as Chikane was done. The Priestess of the Sun let
out a quiet, disappointed sigh, too. Chikane but wondered what her secret crush
was thinking in her head.</span></i></p>

Chikane-chan,” Himeko said as she climbed the short stone flight of stair. When
she reached Chikane, the little angel gave her a warm hug before she climbed
down and got into the limousine. Her waving hand from the window was the last
thing Chikane saw before the car made a right turn at the gate to the Mansion
and vanished. She sighed as she turned around and went back inside with a heart
that was as light as a boulder of rock.</span></i></p>

to play the piano in the music room at the far corner of the West wing. It did
not work out. Somehow, the notes she played sounded so... hollow that she felt
no joy in playing her favorite pieces like she used to in the little angels
presence. Perhaps that was the key. After all, in the golden-haired girls
absence, this Mansion had grown infinitely quieter despite the fact that the
servants were still there, busy with their tasks all over the place. Without
Himeko, this place could have been as lively as a churchyard at midnight, she
thought. She even started considering whether she should call the MBA team His
Mightiness Himemiya Kyou had hired to relieve some of her boredom... and
sadness.</span></i></p>

decided that she would not. Studying business while feeling so depressed
probably would turn the rest of the day into a nightmare. That she had had
enough. Maybe she should retire to her room and have some rest instead. The
Gods knew all too well how hard those four men and three women in the MBA team
had tried their best to stuff knowledge into her brain and exhausted Chikane in
the process. Yes, a little nap would be a good idea indeed. She rose from the
piano seat and walked out of the music room.</span></i></p>

text-indent:.5in'>She never managed to get a nap. It was somewhat similar to
what had happened in the music room, she supposed. Chikane had been in such a
restless state that she could not stop herself from tossing and turning on the
bed, or even keep her eyes closed. In the end, she gave up and decided to stand
by the sill of her window and watch the sun sinking into the horizon, something
she always did whenever she was in a bad mood. It was there that she was seized
by such a feeling of urgency and danger she had summoned her chauffer
immediately and ordered him to take her to the amusement park.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Chikane’s anger rocketed sky-high the moment her attention
returned to the flow of vehicles around her. Every car, including her own, had
pulled to a stop. Peering through the windshield at the front of the limousine,
she felt as if she was going to erupt like a volcano. The car was practically
sitting atop a very low hill, near the junction of the Tenth Avenue and the
Eighth, so it was possible for Chikane to see what kind of traffic lay ahead.
What she did was a seemingly endless road mounted by countless unmoving red
tail lights. She did not believe she could ever reach Mahoroba City Amusement
Park unless she abandoned the car right at this moment. Yet, even if she did,
there was still no guarantee she could arrive on time, seeing that there was still
a long way from here to where Himeko was stranded. A lava-hot flame roared from
the pit of her stomach and soared all the way to her brain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The heat of a thousand suns flared on her back, where the
Moon Crest was, at the same time a disc of silver light emerged beneath her
feet and filled the space within the confinement of the car with its glorious luminescence.
The light was so brilliant that Chikane’s eyes instinctively drew shut. When
they opened up again, she was no longer sitting on the back seat of the black
limousine. She was on her feet now, standing in a large and empty square where
deafening sirens were blaring over her head. She did not need to look at the
Ferris Wheel looming over the distance to her left, or the Merry-go-round
platform to her right, both of which was not moving, to know that she had
arrived at her desired destination. No, she did not need to, not when in front
of her, under the starry sky, was blazing a large golden sphere of light... in
the dead center of which floated Kurusugawa Himeko, the girl she loved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>As if guided by divine will, Chikane’s hands automatically
darted forward before she had an idea of what she was doing. Winds howled and
silver light raged at the same time the golden sphere shattered into a million
sparkling pieces and allowed gravity to pull Himeko toward the cement-paved
ground. Standing very still, Chikane only reached out her hands once more and
commanded the silver light gathering around her body to extend upward and
swathe Himeko’s slender frame. Once it had broken the golden-haired girl’s
fall, the silver light put her into Chikane’s arms as carefully and gently as a
man would handle a fragile egg.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>As soon as she caught Himeko, Chikane immediately scanned the
surrounding for a way out. She saw many paths leading in different directions,
each seemed as likely to be the true exit as the next. Chikane did not want to
choose, for she was well aware that any of them could lead her deeper into the
park, or worse, straight toward an Orochi. She had to find a quicker and safer
way to bring Himeko out of this place. She found it the moment she realized
that silver light was still whirling around her like the strongest tornado she
had ever seen, that torrential currents of lava and ice were coursing madly
inside her body. Holding Himeko more tightly in her arms, Chikane called forth
the powers that had brought her here and helped her save Himeko. And they came.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>A flash of silver light took Chikane and an unconscious
Himeko out of the amusement park and delivered them back to Himeko’s room in
the Himemiya Mansion, just as Chikane had willed it to.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Thanks to the silver light still wreathing around her,
Chikane could see where the large king-sized bed was. The light, however,
winked out the moment she laid the little angel upon the bed and returned the
room to the pitch black darkness that had reigned in here until it was banished
by Chikane’s luminous arrival. Quietly, Chikane flipped a switch and turned on
the two bed lamps sitting atop the small tables located on either side of the
bed. She then gave the sleeping beauty, who did seem to be immersed in a deep
slumber more than a comma, a light, lingering kiss on the forehead before she
pushed a button over the headboard and summoned the maid currently on duty to
this room immediately. Giving her sweetheart one last look, Chikane walked out
of the room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Ojou-sama!” exclaimed a young woman in Himemiya livery, who
arrived moments after Chikane had closed Himeko’s door quietly behind her.
“When did you return?”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Will you tend to Kurusugawa-san inside and help her dress
for bed?” Chikane ignored the maid’s question and said. “Try not to wake her
up.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“As you wished, Ojou-sama.” The servant, whose name Chikane
did not know, gave her a solemn bow as befits Chikane’s high station before she
went inside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Arms folded beneath her chest, Chikane leaned her back
against the wall opposite Himeko’s door and waited. Under the light of the
crystal chandeliers hanging in the spacious hallway, she started to wonder what
had happened inside the amusement park that could have lead to Himeko’s being
encapsulated by that sphere of golden light. It was then that anger rose in her
heart and hissed like a viper. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>And
where was Oogami Souma? </span></i>she thought. She had entrusted the girl she
loved to the boy, thinking that he would somehow keep Himeko safe. The Orochi
Follower, regardless of whether he had overcome his innate darkness or not, had
proved to be most unreliable tonight. Chikane doubted she would trust him ever
again....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“What are you doing?!” Himeko’s voice cried out from beyond
the closed door. She sounded on the verge of panic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Please calm down, Kurusugawa-sama,” replied the maid in a
polite and patient tone. “I’m helping you get dressed for bed, as Ojou-sama has
instructed me to.”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Chikane-chan’s home?! Where is she?” A strangely joyous note
entered the angel’s voice.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Thundering footfalls were all Chikane heard before the
mahogany door swung open and admitted a half-dressed Himeko. Chikane’s breath
caught. The only pieces of clothing that the little angel had on herself right
at this moment were her bra, her panties, and an unbuttoned pajama shirt
hanging loosely on her slender shoulders, all of which left a fair amount of
skin on her body bare. Chikane felt a blush creeping onto her cheeks. Although
the sight of her sweetheart in her undergarments or even naked was nothing new
to her, she could not help but feel... dizzy as if she had gulped down a
glassful of alcohol.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Giving herself a mental shake, Chikane focused her attention
on the face of the one she loved. Only then did she notice that the other
girl’s visage was being contorted with fear. Chikane frowned. <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Why?</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Chikane-chan, please, call Oogami-sensei for me!” the angel
said urgently, her hands gripping Chikane’s sleeves.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

going to like what Himeko was about to tell her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Sou-chan’s in danger! He’s fighting an Orochi right now!”
Each of those words was a hammer’s blow to Chikane’s heart. “Call the sensei,
let him know!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Oogami-san is a powerful Orochi himself, Himeko. He may not
need reinforcement,” Chikane said, still trying to recover from the shock. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Please, Chikane-chan!” Himeko pleaded. “I’m worried about
Sou-chan. He stayed to buy time for my escape. If anything happened to him....”
Tears welled up in her eyes and made Chikane felt as if someone had run a sword
through her chest. The girl’s panic, her urgency, and her concern toward the
boy had confirmed Chikane’s greatest fear. Oogami Souma’s position had risen
very high in Himeko’s heart. And whether his was higher than Chikane’s own or
not... she did not think she would like to find out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I see.” Chikane gave the angel an assuring nod. “I shall call
Shingetsu immediately.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Thank you so much, Chikane-chan.” Himeko literally jumped
into Chikane’s arms and gave her a warm, tight hug. Sighing inwardly, Chikane
returned the hug and let her hand brush the other girl’s glorious stream of
golden hair while trains of thoughts crisscrossed madly in her mind. Five
minutes later, she realized that her secret crush had not let go of her. In
fact, Chikane was under the impression that the girl had done nothing but
tighten her arms around Chikane’s body and rested her face against Chikane’s
neck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Chikane sighed. She would have preferred to hold the girl
this way forever... but she could not. Not when she still needed to call the
Grand Shrine per the angel’s request, not when her servant was peering at them
from inside Himeko’s room, her face painted with stark curiosity. Perhaps the
young woman was wondering why the mistress of the Himemiya Mansion was holding
her best friend in her arms so intimately, with such a blissful expression on
her face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

small of Himeko’s back and stroked it gently. “Why don’t you get dressed <i><span

early today? You must have been exhausted.”</p>

pulled back and asked in a wondering tone. She stopped talking altogether the
moment she realized she was only half-dressed. The angel immediately pulled the
front of her pajama shirt together and walked back into her room with a
complexion red enough to shame a sunset. The maid inside gave Chikane another
bow and closed the mahogany door.</p>

at a round table placed just outside a coffee shop near Mahoroba City Amusement
Park, Yui the Goddess of the Sun took the last sip from the cup of Cappuccino
she ordered. It was by no means as exquisite as the coffee she was often served
in the Holy City – the Immortals had grown fond of the black, bitter liquid
over the years, so coffee shops rose in Heaven one after another to satisfy
their need – but it was good enough to please her, she supposed. Besides, she
had heard that no shop in the area brewed better coffee. The incredible amount
of customers it attracted – every other seat was taken, every table was filled
– surely justified that claim. She had never seen a more crowded shop during
the entire time she spent in Mahoroba.</p>

the twinkling stars decorated the darkness of the heavens. She wondered what
little Himeko and Chikane were doing now. She sighed. Those children were just
clueless, and hopeless, too. They loved one another so dearly, there was
nothing that could not be more obvious, yet unless they told one another how
they felt outright, they would never know how much they were worth in each
other’s hearts. Well, that couldn’t be helped in any case. Little Himeko was
extremely dense in that area and Chikane... was just worrying too much.</p>

she noticed the presence of the Tsukazaki sisters. The twins, more beautiful
and richly dressed than most people in this city, were walking toward her while
their graceful and elegant flowing movements drew the eyes of other customers
in the shop, men’s and women’s alike. Upon arrival at Yui’s table, Tsukazaki
Haruhi and Tsukazaki Fuyura gave her a deep bow before speaking up in unison,
in the same voice, with the same pitch, “We apologize for being late,
Yui-sama.” </p>

smiled warmly at the Tsukazaki siblings. Only after they had settled in front
of her did she notice that they brought along a small box, the sweet fragrance
emanating from which was distinct even amidst that of the coffee permeating the
night air. Fuyura, who had the box in her hands, held it the way someone would
a family heirloom. Whenever the younger Tsukazaki glanced at the box, which she
did every ten seconds or so, her usually snowy complexion would grow a little
bit redder and her fingertips would brush against one of its six sides in a
most affectionate manner. Yui smiled. She believed she knew the one who would
receive that box from the girl later, once she had returned to the Underworld.</p>

straight at her with a strange smile on her lips. When the girl’s gaze
flickered toward the box in her little sister’s hands, then came back to Yui’s

had been harboring some sort of secret. Yui chuckled softly to herself. Well,

decided to forestall them. She raised a hand, which made them fall silent.</p>

Fuyu-chan?” Yui was still smiling, but her firm tone made it clear that she
didn’t want to come to the Underworld no matter what they might say to convince
her. The girls realized that, so they only sighed deeply and glanced at each other
in sheer exasperation.</p>

resignation. “I daresay that we will have everything you require before the

text-indent:.5in'>“I’m very pleased, Haru-chan, Fuyu-chan,” Yui said, smiling
brightly at the Tsukazaki siblings. “Will you convey my message to everyone
involved in the Operation that I truly appreciate their efforts?”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

any other instruction for us before we leave?”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“No... actually, yes. Haru-chan, may I have a word in private
with your sister?” Tsukazaki Haruhi smiled as if she had expected it. Fuyura,
on the other hand, frowned at Yui suspiciously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“So what is it, Yui-sama?” Fuyura said once her elder sister
had left them alone. The younger Tsukazaki was still holding the box in her
hands in such a way that she gave Yui the impression she was going to die before
she let go of it. She made Yui smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“How much did you pay for that strawberry cheesecake,
Fuyu-chan?” Yui asked offhandedly.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“A couple of thousand yen for six slices,” Fuyura answered,
her dark eyes flickering at the box in her hand while her cheeks reddened once
more. “I know it was rather costly but the sample I tasted was very good, so....”
She gave a start. “How did you know I bought a strawberry cheesecake? Did you
probe the box with your powers?” the raven-haired girl demanded heatedly. Over
the years, little by little, Yui had managed to earn the twins’ love, but that
little detail had never made Fuyura mince words with her if the girl didn’t
want to. In fact, of all the people in the Underworld, <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Fuyura</span></i> was the one most
likely to tell Yui to her face that she was being an idiot... which the girl
did... a few times.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I can swear on my honor as a Goddess that I did no such
thing.” Yui laughed quietly. “I just happen to know someone in Reiha who was <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>extremely</span></i> fond of that kind
of cake, that’s all.” Fuyura’s usually snowy complexion went beet-red.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Since when did you know?” the girl asked after a while.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Pretty much the beginning, Fuyu-chan.” Yui chuckled. “I only
needed a glance at you to notice that you were madly in love. After all, I once
behaved the very same way.”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“How did it go?” Yui knew the answer to her own question
before the younger Tsukazaki opened her mouth and spoke. It couldn’t have been
more obvious, really, when the girl had seemed so agonized the moment she heard
what Yui asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I was rejected,” Fuyura mumbled in a bitter voice.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I’m very sorry, Fuyu-chan.” Yui moved to the chair next to
that of the younger Tsukazaki, where she gently ran her fingers through the
girl’s stream of glossy raven hair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Not your fault, it’s mine,” Fuyura muttered. “I was too
hasty. I should have been more patient. I... should have asked Haruhi for
advice before I confessed.”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I will.” Fuyura nodded and smiled. “I am just feeling a little
depressed at the moment. I will get better soon.” She hesitated. “Yui-sama, do
you think I should keep on trying? I mean, my feelings may never get across....”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Why do you ask me that when you have never intended on
giving up?” Yui smiled tenderly at the lovesick girl next to her while tapping
her forefinger softly upon the top of the cake box. “If you have, you wouldn’t
have bought this, would you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Well, yes,” the younger Tsukazaki muttered shyly. “After
all, time changes all of creation, and I have all the time in the world. I
guess being an Immortal does have its perks.” Fuyura laughed softly at that.
The girl sounded cheerful again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“That’s a good way of thinking.” Yui gave the girl a hug. “I
wish you luck, Fuyu-chan.” Then Yui caught sight of another girl in casual
shirt and trousers standing half a dozen yards away, whose back was leaning
against a wall near the entrance to the coffee shop, whose platinum long hair
was deathly <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>still</span></i>
even in the night winds, whose gray eyes, lightless and void of emotion, were
fixed at Yui herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I have company,” Yui said to the younger Tsukazaki as she
pulled away, “so I guess I’ll see you later ne, Fuyu-chan.”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“As you wished, Yui-sama. And do take care of yourself.”
Fuyura rose gracefully to her feet, offered Yui a deep bow, then walked away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>As soon as the younger Tsukazaki was gone, the
platinum-haired girl immediately took her seat. No one in the vicinity except
Yui noticed that the newcomer had crossed the distance separating her initial
position and what was once Fuyura’s chair in less than a heartbeat. Well,
mortals couldn’t see what lay right in front of their eyes most of the times
anyway....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I’m impressed that you found me, Rinne-chan,” Yui said with
a smile. “Mind telling me how you managed that?”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I was in the neighborhood, nee-sama,” replied the
stone-faced girl. “I was about to go home when I saw you. Just a coincidence.”
Her quiet and monotonous voice made her face seem lively. How long had it been
since the girl last smiled, Yui wondered? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“In the neighborhood? Up to no good again, perhaps?” Yui
chuckled quietly. “Please don’t tell me those sirens that have been blaring for
a while now have something to do with you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Rinne shook her head. “No, that was not my doing.” She
glanced toward the direction of the amusement park. Not just sirens, Yui had
heard explosions, too. She would have gone to check it out, of course, had she
not had to stay here and wait for the Tsukazaki siblings. What could have been
going on over there, really?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Well then, Rinne-chan, what business have you with me
today?” Rinne had never been the type who came to someone just because she
wanted to say hi, that much Yui could still remember after all these years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Have you been visiting <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>him</span></i>
of late, nee-sama?” Rinne asked, her voice growing affectionate, her face soft.
It was moments like this that people could see how beautiful the girl was. Too
bad she hid this side of her as vigorously as any man would his treasure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Almost every day,” Yui said quietly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Is he well?” Concern and love shone in the girl’s gray eyes.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“There’s no danger to Akira’s health, Rinne-chan.” Yui
sighed. “He’s rather haggard, but his Immortality is as strong as ever.” She
hesitated. “I... can’t tell you <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>how</span></i>
I know, my dear one, but Akira has always been <i><span style='font-family:
"Footlight MT Light"'>grieving</span></i> for you. He misses you a lot.” A tear
rolled down the cheek of Yui’s companion as the girl’s expression turned
mournful. Quietly, Yui reached out with her hand and wiped the tear off Rinne’s
pretty face. “Don’t cry.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I am eternally grateful to you, nee-sama.” Rinne bowed to
Yui where she sat. “Thank you, for having taken care of him for me during my
absence.” When she straightened up again, she used the sleeve of her shirt to
dab at her eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You don’t have to say that,” Yui whispered as her hand gently
stroked the girl’s head. “He’s my blood brother. It’s natural that I watch over
him as best I could.” Rinne murmured something in response, but Yui couldn’t
tell what. Silence followed and stretched rather uncomfortably until Rinne
seemed to have suddenly remembered something and pounded a fist upon her palm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I almost forgot, nee-sama,” the platinum-haired girl said.
“I saw Tsukiyomi-sama on my way here. She was floating somewhere above the
Amusement Park.” For some reason, her lips thinned and eyes narrowed as if in
irritation. Yui wondered why. Sure, unlike Yui, Yue had never been close to
Rinne to begin with, but they never did anything to offend each other<i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>... did they</span></i>?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Oh, were Chikane and Himeko there?” Yui asked. Those
children should be the only reason why Yue would come to a place in which she
had never been interested. The Goddess of the Moon did nothing except for
staying close to the Priestesses and silently protecting them from the shadows
these days.... Yui sighed. In a way, the girls were all that Yue lived for.
Should the former perish.... Yui shivered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“She didn’t.” Rinne shook her head. “The commotion was caused
by the Orochi First Head, who came for Seventh, who happened to be in there at
the same time,” she said matter-of-factly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“The Priestess of the Sun herself, obviously, nee-sama,”
Rinne answered in a flat voice. Maybe she was truly grateful to Yui... but that
never stopped Rinne from talking to her the way she did to almost everybody
else, of course.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I see....” For a moment there, Yui considered letting Rinne
in on the plans she herself was hatching just so the girl would leave the
Priestesses alone... and rejected it. It would be much wiser to observe the
situation for a little bit more before making a decision, she believed....<i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'> </span></i>Less dangerous and risky,
too.</p>

either mocked me or gave me the cold shoulder. I tried to ask what I have done
to offend her many times, but she just wouldn’t answer me.”</p>

doubt the girl, though, for Rinne never lied without good cause, and she had no
cause to lie to Yui about such a personal matter.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

To Yui’s surprise, Rinne <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>smiled</span></i>
softly before she rose to her feet.</p>

without being noticed amidst a sea of people. Yui could only <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>tsk</span></i> in exasperation. It was
one thing to speak in riddles to toy with people but it was another thing to be
at the receiving end. Yui had had no idea that Rinne could do something like
that, being the straightforward and simpleminded girl she was. Yui scratched
her head. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>And why does Yue

in sleep. Worse, he seemed to have been struck down by a fever so terrible heat

obviously was aware of that fact the way he kept grimacing at his adopted
little brother. Probably the man was wishing that he had never asked his fellow
Priests to work their Healing upon the boy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>It was a brutal business, in any case. Yukihito could still
recall how thirteen Priests, the most skilled Healers under Kazuki’s command,
had sweated within an inch of their lives trying to heal a dozen of broken
bones and internal juries in Oogami Souma’s body. Yukihito would <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>not</span></i> have attempted that.
The High Priest, worried about his brother’s life, had not stopped to consider
before he screamed at his subordinates to help the boy. Kazuki should have
realized that Oogami Souma, regardless of whether he had disavowed his ties to
the Sinner or not, was still an Orochi Follower whose powers stemmed from the <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Darkness</span></i> of humanity. As
such, there was no point in trying to make the power of the <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Light</span></i> heal him, was there?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'> Too bad, the Healers did not know, and Yukihito did not dare
reveal that, so he could only watch thirteen elderly men trying to do the
impossible by pitching their holy powers against the Orochi darkness within
Souma’s soul. They lost, of course, but they never noticed that they <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>had</span></i> until all of them
collapsed from fatigue. Result? No bone and no injury in Souma’s body were
healed. They <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>would have had </span></i>all
on their own had the Priests left Souma to the care of his own self-healing
powers, in fact. The only thing that the Priests had succeeded in was delaying
Souma’s recovery. Even now, a considerable portion of Souma’s strength was
being used to expel the alien energies that the Healers had forced into him.
Yukihito shook his head and thought, <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Ignorant
mortals.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Do we know who attacked Souma-san, sensei?” he asked. When
Yukihito, Oogami Kazuki, and another bunch of Protectors of the Swords arrived
at the amusement park, they only found the boy lying in his own blood,
breathing very weakly, and no perpetrators at all. Well, he could have
contacted the Holy Messengers to get the information himself, of course, but
that would involve enormous risk that he did not exactly need at this moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Yukihito’s eyes flickered toward the open window in Oogami
Souma’s room. There, he spotted many traces of powers. They were extremely
faint, but to someone like Yukihito, they were unmistakable. Yukihito did not
have to guess to know that he had been tailed by spies from the Underworld. He
noticed them ten minutes after he ran into the twins in Downtown Mahoroba,
which told him that it was they who sent the infuriating pests to shadow him.
Yukihito must have slipped something to make them suspicious then... he just
did not know what. Worst of all, he could not kill the spies, for that would
certainly confirm the Underworld’s suspicion. But well, once the Holy Messengers
dealt with those sneaky creatures, Yukihito would be free.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I know who did, Yukihito-kun,” Oogami Kazuki, sitting on a
chair by his brother’s bed, answered quietly. “It was Tsubasa-kun.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“And that would be...?” Yukihito prompted. He had the feeling
he had seen this name once before, probably mentioned in one of the numerous
reports archived in the Messenger<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>
</span></i>Division’s computer, but he had not had the time to read it. The
best he could recall was that Tsubasa was the name of an Orochi and that was
it. It did not explain why Kazuki seemed to be quite intimate with the man, who
should be the High Priest’s sworn enemy as well as that of humankind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Souma’s blood brother himself,” the High Priest said in a
pained voice. Yukihito blinked. “I saw Tsubasa-kun earlier today, he paid me a
two-second visit, you see, but I never <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>imagined</span></i>
in my wildest dream that he would attack Souma.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Were the brothers close, sensei?” Yukihito asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“As close as they could be.” Kazuki let out a long sigh.
“They were inseparable as kids. Souma looked up to Tsubasa-kun the way he would
his idol.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“If so, why has Souma-san never mentioned his brother
before?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“It was only natural that he hasn’t,” answered the High
Priest. “Sit down, Yukihito-kun,” the other man gestured at the second chair in
the room, “and I’ll tell you all about the entire story.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Are you sure you want to, sensei?” Yukihito-said levelly,
unmoving where he stood. “It is, after all, a family matter.”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Souma and I see you as family now, my young friend.” Kazuki
smiled. “In fact, Souma himself has been trying to tell you everything. He just
never found the chance.” The High Priest’s hand once more gestured at the
chair. Yukihito took it, meanwhile thinking how ironic it was that those
mortals considered him family while his very own daughter only warmed up to him
because she was afraid of what he might do to the one she loved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You see, Yukihito-kun,” Oogami Kazuki began, “Souma’s life
was both a blessing and a curse. It was a blessing in that he had an angel for
an elder brother. It was a curse in that his <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>father</span></i>
was a demon from the depth of hell.” The High Priest took a deep breath, his
visage roiling with anger. “Having lost their mother quite early in life, the
children grew up in fear and suffering. The only things their father, a man
with less humanity than a beast, were good at was consuming alcohol before he
returned home every single day and then beating the brothers to a pulp.”
Kazuki’s fists, clenched atop his lap, started to quiver.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'> “You must have noticed it already, Yukihito-kun, that Souma
did everything he could to avoid being seen without clothes. It wasn’t that he
was shy. It was that he didn’t want anyone to see the scars on his skin, the
result of the terrible tortures he had undergone as a kid. Not just that, even
his mind was scarred, for life. Even now, the boy would tremble whenever
someone uttered a name that resembled that of his father.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The High Priest paused for a moment, then continued, “As you
are probably aware, Souma is in love with Kurusugawa Himeko, the Priestess of
the Sun. Although he had recognized her as soon as he saw her one year ago, he
never told her once that he was once her childhood friend. He was afraid that
she would learn the secrets of his dark, painful past, so when he realized that
Kurusugawa-san didn’t recognize him, he decided to start their relationship
anew. For many people, the past is a fond memory. For Souma, it’s something
that is best forgotten.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“How was it that he was adopted into your family in the end,
sensei?” Yukihito asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“It was a tragic business, Yukihito-kun.” Oogami Kazuki
massaged his forehead. “It happened quite a few years ago, back when I still
knew nothing about the two children’s living condition. One night, I received a
phone call from an officer in a Tokyo police station in the middle of the
night. He told me that Souma and Tsubasa-kun’s father had been murdered, and as
the children’s only living relative, I had a right to know.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Panicking, I immediately arranged for a flight to the
capital, where I was finally informed of one detail the officer had left out
during the phone call. The perpetrator in this murder... was none other than
Tsubasa-kun himself. It was only after that was I allowed to meet the child. Yukihito-kun,
Tsubasa-kun was only twelve then, but when I saw him in the police’s station,
he seemed to have aged at least a few years. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>I
have a favor to ask of you, sensei. Please take Souma with you when you leave,</span></i>
the boy had said without preamble. I can still remember the desperation in his
voice, the deep sadness in his eyes, and the tears that never stopped flowing
down his cheeks while he told me what he and his brother had been going through
since their mother’s death. I was horrified.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“That
monster was trying to kill Souma, </span></i>Tsubasa-kun told me in a broken
voice. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>He came home and he
saw Souma doing homework. Somehow, he got angry and started beating him. I... I
didn’t know what to do. Souma was bleeding, and he looked like he was in so
much pain. I... I... only wanted to help him so I took up the knife in the
kitchen and told the monster to leave my brother alone. I didn’t expect him to
leap at me. The next thing I know, the knife was already in his heart.</span></i>
The boy looked at his hands in horror, then, as though unable to believe what
he had done to his father.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Yukihito glanced at the unconscious boy lying on his bed. If
he recalled correctly, the other Orochi Followers were in no better condition.
Each and every single one of them had encountered tragedies in their life,
either in their early childhood or just a few years before the Orochi powers in
their bodies became activated. He but wondered if it was just a coincidence...
or a cruel stroke of fate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Yukihito-kun, I had been shocked at that time, so much so
that all I could do was listen to that frightened child’s story,” the High
Priest said mournfully. “In the end, Tsubasa-kun repeated that he wished Souma
to be taken to Mahoroba with me when I left. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Deliver
him out of this pit of hell, sensei, </span></i>he begged me. <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>I only wanted to save him from the
monster, but I’m not going to get away with it. Souma only has you to rely on
now, sensei. Please, grant my one final wish, raise him as your child, give him
the happiness that I can never give.</span></i> As soon as he was done talking,
Tsubasa-kun had fallen to his knees and bowed to me repeatedly, his forehead
pounding against the concrete floor. Horrified, I tried to stop him. He never
let me, even though his head was bleeding, until I agreed to adopt Souma into
my family. He had wept so happily in my arms then, before he gave in to the
stress and fatigue that had been plaguing his young body.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

him a sad smile. “So I hadn’t been able to believe it when I heard from Souma’s
mouth that Tsubasa-kun had attacked him.”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

emotion fastening around his heart. He had only spent one year in the Human
World but during that one year, he had been taught one thing that a few
thousand years in Heaven could not. Yukihito grimaced. Feelings of <i><span

disquieting sometimes.</p>

to her comrades as a cat-fanatic. The other one, surprisingly, was a girl with

Eight Elemental Blades, despite having their own respective weaknesses, are
very close to each other in term of strength. Those three Orochi should possess

firepower as you do, Souma.” He fixed his eyes on the kid to make sure his
words were driven home. “The only reason why the Followers couldn’t demonstrate
the might of their Elemental Blades was that they had been <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>suppressed</span></i> by Raien’s
special gift, the <span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Voice of
Sorrow<i>,</i></span> which nullified any and all magical weapons within its
range.”</p>

possesses the same unearthly voice that Raien has.”</p>

Kazuki looked into his brother’s eyes. “You were <i><span style='font-family:

your sanity could be devoured by the darkness lurking within the sword. Of the
possibility that you would once again bare your Blade against the one you love.

utilize the Lightning Blade to the fullest, Tsubasa-kun would defeat you again.

pair of trousers to replace the pajama he currently wore. When he was done, he
quietly summoned Raien into his hand and used it to open a Dimensional Portal.
Grimacing at the Sealed Sword, he walked into the silvery surface and let it
close behind him. He absolutely was not going to sit in his room and waited

of you to visit us in the dead of night so, Oogami-san,” Himemiya Chikane
observed. Under the light spreading out from the grand crystal chandelier hung below
the ceiling of the Main Hall, Oogami Souma appeared decidedly haggard and
plagued by anxiety. He looked almost an entirely different person from the
normally cool and proud Jin-sama whom many a student of Ototachibana Academy
were ever fond of. The injuries he had taken earlier today must have
contributed something to this change of façade, Chikane supposed. “Would you
like some tea?” she offered. Regardless of what she felt toward him, he had
arrived at her house as a guest. As such, he was entitled to the courtesy she
would have shown anybody else. Besides... he deserved it.</p>

wake her. I’ll just take a look at her before I go. I beg of you.” Chikane
peered at the boy, slightly taken aback by his words. Ever since Chikane first
met Oogami Souma upon enrollment in Ototachibana Academy, she had realized at
once that pride was all that embodied his existence. Never before had she seen
him act so humble. Never before had she heard him beg.</p>

the second floor of the Himemiya Mansion, then walked in silence in the
spacious hallway in the West Wing, with Oogami Souma trailing a few feet behind
Chikane. She could almost feel his wondering eyes upon her back, she could
almost hear the question hanging at the tip of his tongue. Were Chikane to
guess, she would say that the boy was still unable to believe that she had just
agreed to his request so easily, so quickly, and so unconditionally. After all,
he was well aware of the hostility with which she had always treated him. After
all, he probably knew that she had not found it in herself to forgive his
attempt to murder Himeko on her birthday.</p>

Himeko because she could <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>not</span></i>
refuse him. Indeed, she had been very angry at him earlier this evening because
she thought he had not fulfilled his duty of protecting Himeko. However, when
she learned that he had sustained grievous injuries to buy time for the
golden-haired girl’s escape, that anger immediately melted away. Chikane
allowed herself another sigh. Moreover, Oogami Souma had saved Himeko’s life
once when the woman of Orochi used her Sword to part the skin on the little
angel’s back. That debt she had yet to repay. That was the only reason Chikane
would permit an <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Orochi</span></i>
to venture this far into the Himemiya Mansion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

arrival at the door to Himeko’s room. The boy nodded, uncertainty still
lingering upon his handsome face.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

opened it. The golden-haired girl – lying on her side upon the soft mattress of
her bed, inside a room illuminated by the dim bed lamps – seemed immersed in a
deep yet peaceful slumber. After Chikane called the Shingetsu High Priest
earlier in the evening per Himeko’s request, she had come back to this very
room to ask what had gone wrong in the amusement park of Mahoroba. The little
angel did her best to tell Chikane the whole story but toward the end, fatigue
had caught up with her and put her to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

“Please do not wake her.”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Not wasting any time, Oogami Souma walked in, crossed the
room with the grace and quietness of a cat, and arrived at Himeko’s bedside.
There, he fell to one knee and started to study Himeko’s sleeping face with an
expression so tender even a blind person would notice that the boy was looking
at the one he loved. Still standing at the door step, Chikane allowed herself a
second inward sigh. She was about to leave to give the boy some time alone with
the little angel when he rose back to his feet and exited the room.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>“I told you I only wanted to look at her, didn’t I?” Oogami
gave her a quiet smile. It had been the first time that he smiled to her ever
since they met. Then his visage grew solemn as he offered her a deep,
respectful bow. “You have my gratitude, Himemiya.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“And you mine,” Chikane answered and gave him a bow of her
own. “I thank you for all you have done for Himeko’s sake.” Shock and
incredulity were visible in Oogami’s eyes as he stared unblinking at her. Then
after a few minutes, as if he had realized that he was staring, the boy gave
his head a few shakes before his face grew red with embarrassment... and what
Chikane knew to be shame. She wondered why.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“No.” The boy shook his head, then snapped his fingers and
summoned a Dimensional Portal that hovered vertically by his side. It was only
then did Chikane realize that her vision was no longer the same. She had seen
Oogami do this once before, when he took Himeko from her arms after the beach
incident, but at that time, she only perceived the Portal as a silvery surface.
Now, for reasons she could not comprehend, she was able to see the threads of
power from which the Portal was woven and how they all laced together in an
extremely intricate pattern. And strangest of them all, Chikane believed that
should she choose to do so, she could weave a Portal with less than half the
effort.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

last bewildered look before he stepped into the silvery surface and vanished
along with the thing.</p>

Himeko’s room and sat on Himeko’s bed, her back leaning against the headboard.
There, she studied the sleeping form of the little angel in silence. <i><span

visit you just now, Himeko,</span></i> she thought, <i><span style='font-family:

comrade? Or something more than that? Tell me, Himeko, how do I square with
your childhood friend in your heart? Is there any way for me to continue loving

out from the Dimensional Portal that he created in the hallway of the Himemiya

upon a ground cratered by Hokuto’s fearsome attacks, Tsubasa-nii-san was idly
puffing his cigarette. From the relaxing expression on the man’s face, he did
not seem to register the fact that he was standing amid the destruction he
himself had crafted, or that the stench of death was in every breath of air he

regarded Souma calmly.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Not saying a word, Souma raised his arm horizontally to the
ground and channeled his powers until the air around his hand shimmered in
heat. Tsubasa-nii-san only watched with an expressionless face while lightning
forked from Souma’s fingertips and wove themselves into a shaft of blinding
purple light. It only took another second for Raien the Sealed Sword to
materialize into Souma’s grasp. The other man’s face hardened, his eyes grew
cold, and his mouth twisted in distaste. He did not appear pleased.</p>

cigarette from his lips and tossed it away. A flame coming out of nowhere
reduced the thing to cinders before it could reach the apex of its climb. “Well
then, do not ask me later why I do not show mercy to you, Souma.” The older man
raised his hand overhead, his palm facing the starlit heavens. <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“Descend, Lord of the Hallowed Stars,</span></i>
Hokuto<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>!”</span></i> his voice
rang coldly across the night.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>At Tsubasa-nii-san’s call, winds screeched and howled as an
amazingly powerful aura swept across the earth, hurling the small pebbles away
from him. Even Souma felt threatened by the amount of energy welling up like
the strongest tides within his brother’s body. The ground shook, the trees
swayed and the air trembled in the wake of the Star Blade, termed strongest of
the Sealed Swords. Cold white light poured out of the man’s hand and solidified
into the crooked sword which gleamed dangerously under the moonless skies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

toughest opponent he had ever faced, Souma released his powers into the
Lightning Blade. Purple lightning dancing from Raien’s edge struck the earth
and drew ragged lines across the ground. He lunged at Tsubasa-nii-san then,
throwing everything he got at the Orochi Follower, hoping he could defeat the
man before he himself was defeated.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>“You
are awake, Himeko,” Himemiya Chikane observed, slightly surprised. A moment
ago, the Priestess of the Sun was still soundly asleep when Chikane opened the
door and received a cup of coffee from the on-duty maid. When Chikane closed it
and turned around, she found the golden-haired girl sitting on the bed, her
amethyst eyes gazing into the distance beyond one of her room’s windows. Most
notably, a golden light was shining beneath the fabric of the little angel’s
pajama shirt, right where Chikane knew the Sun Crest should be. She wondered
why.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

coffee on the table, she sat down by Himeko’s side on the bed and asked.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“No.” The other girl shook her head. When she turned to look
Chikane in the eye afterwards, her face was painted with worries. “Do you see
that, Chikane-chan?” The little angel gestured at the window, beyond the
darkness of which light, sometimes purple, sometimes white, was dancing madly
between the heavens and earth. Chikane glanced at the Sun Crest hidden beneath
Himeko’s clothes. That light in the distance... it seemed to flash in resonance
with that of the source of illumination in the middle of Himeko’s chest. <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Was that what had roused her from her
sleep?</span></i> Chikane wondered.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“It’s a battle,” the little angel answered with a voice that
matched her facial expression. “Sou-chan’s fighting someone out there.” She put
a hand on Chikane’s shoulder. It was sweaty, and it was trembling. “I don’t
know why, but I can feel what’s in their hearts. Anger, pain, and so many other
scary things....” Her voice shook, and her amethyst eyes were emblazoned with
fear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Chikane once again glanced at the window. A battle, Himeko
had said, one that involved her childhood friend Oogami Souma. Was that why the
boy came here earlier to visit the golden-haired girl? Come to think of it, he
did seem like someone who was on his deathbed, who wanted to have his final
wish fulfilled before he could depart this world in peace. Perhaps that was the
reason he suddenly treated Chikane humility and respect instead of flaring his
overblown pride at Chikane as he used to. Well, the prospect of death changed a
person’s behavior drastically, she supposed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

anxious. “Will you take me to where Sou-chan is?” She had both hands on
Chikane’s shoulders now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Why, Himeko?” she asked, feeling her heart clench. “If we
can see the signs of battle here, it must be very fierce. We will run the risk
of losing our lives should we get near them. Besides, what can we do?” There
were a few things Chikane could do, actually, but she was not sure whether they
were enough to let her meddle in the fight of two powerful Orochi and survive
unscathed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I know that, but I have to do something, Chikane-chan,” the
little angel insisted. “Sou-chan’s an important person to me. I don’t want to
lose him. Please, Chikane-chan!” she pleaded. The sincerity and the urgency in
her voice shook Chikane to the core of her existence. She had the feeling that
something within her just broke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Well then, let us go together, Himeko,” Chikane said as she
pulled her sweet little angel into a tight hug. “You should change into
something warm. It is really cold out there.” Her heart ached so terribly she
was almost unable to feel the soft body of the one she loved.</p>

the Lord,” meeting blade with blade, strokes after strokes, Souma’s brother
answered. His voice was calm as a frozen pond even when both he and Souma were
aware that should Raien touch the man’s flesh, his life would be forfeited in
less than a heartbeat. Yet, Souma had a feeling Tsubasa-nii-san was confident
that such a thing wasn’t going to happen. Souma agreed, however reluctantly.
Although his brother’s swordsmanship was not as good as the Orochi with the
Water Blade, it was more than enough to deflect any attack Souma threw at him.
Besides, it was not as if he could bring himself to hurt his blood brother
anyway. All he ever wanted... was to find a way so that both of them could
survive afterwards.</p>

text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“Destiny?
Then how do you explain why I am fighting you right now?” </span></i>Souma
leaped up and brought Raien down with his full weight. The only way to solve
this problem right now was to blast the Star Blade away from Tsubasa-nii-san
and deprived him of his powers. Once Souma accomplished that, restraining his
brother wouldn’t be impossible anymore. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Then...
then... </span></i>Souma trembled at the thought in his mind,<i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'> perhaps we can be a family again.</span></i></p>

text-indent:.5in'>“Would you stop raising your voice, Souma? It is unseemly.”
Tsubasa-nii-san raised his Hokuto upward and caught Raien in one of its crooks.
Then just like what happened earlier, his hand placed itself an inch away from
Souma’s chest, preparing to unleash his devastatingly light. However, this time
Souma was prepared. Twisting his wrist, he separated Raien from Hokuto and
moved the blade between Tsubasa-nii-san’s hand and his body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>White and purple light burst out at the same time as a
deafening explosion threw Souma and Tsubasa-nii-san apart. Even when Souma had
had to stagger a few steps backward before he regained his balance, his brother
stood exactly where he was before the impact, face unperturbed, eyes glowing
with joy. The man’s full-mouth smile was decidedly disturbing.</p>

possess nearly as much power earlier today, Souma. Does that mean you have
finally loosened your grip on Raien’s own soul?”</p>

Souma had never felt any better. His strength was rising with an alarming rate,
his body brimming with enough energy to level this whole park to the ground.
Yet, the signs of danger had already begun to surface. Along with the boundless
powers came a dark shadow weighing on his mind. Somewhere deep within his soul,
something was urging him to release it completely, raving <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Kill! Kill! Kill!</span></i> inside
his head all the while. Souma could feel his own eyes burn with the flame of
hate, his heart swell with murderous intents. In his hand, Raien, the greatest
danger of all<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>,</span></i>
pulsed viciously. He had to end this quickly, or the sword was going to swallow
his sanity whole.</p>

fighting to save this world. If it is not my destiny to destroy, then it’s not
yours either!” Souma decided to try talking to his brother. The difference in
their power was too great. Souma’s plan of defeating Tsubasa-nii-san was
obviously not going well.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

at the ground. Like huge shark fins parting the water surface, hundreds of
triangular blades of cold white light emerged from where the Star Blade touched
the earth and rushed toward Souma.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Once again, he jumped high up into the sky. The blades did
not stop their pursuit, though. They sprang up from the ground and became
deadly rays which targeted him from all sides. Undaunted by the relentless
attacks, Souma swirled Raien around himself. The lightning bolts emerged from
the sword and together, they wove a spinning barrier about Souma’s body. As the
white blades crashed upon his defense, they were forced to change directions
and had no other places to go but thundering downward. Another series of
explosions broke out. Deserted booths and trees alike were burnt to ashes in an
instant.</p>

Souma thought. The lightning barrier had begun to fade and there was just no
time to construct a new one. Having no other choice, Souma hurled Raien against
Hokuto, knowing that he was behind in both timing and strength. The aftershocks
sent him flying toward the earth like a rock boulder and slammed Souma’s back
upon the hard, paved ground. Blood spilled out from his mouth in nozzles. Yet,
Souma had no time to wait for the pain to subside. Using Raien as leverage,
Souma leapt up again just in time to escape Hokuto’s crooked blade, which drove
itself into the earth where Souma lay one heartbeat ago.</p>

Himeko’s room with its glorious luminescence. The night winds of October, as if
summoned by the light, streamed into the room through the open windows,
bringing along the fragrance of the flowers planted in back garden of Chikane’s
house.</p>

even angrier. Souma was not going to join him in the ranks of the glorious Orochi,
was he? <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Was he?</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“Have you
ever eaten out of a trashcan, Souma? Have you ever slept somewhere on the
street under the falling rain?”</span></i> Lashing Hokuto from left to right in
a wide arc, Tsubasa struck Raien with every ounce of strength he possessed. To
his satisfaction, the Lightning Blade left Souma’s hand and went flying out of
sight. “Have you ever knelt down in front of someone to beg for your life when
you hate him so much you want to kill him?” Still, Tsubasa’s fury refused to
recede. With his free hand, he drove his fist against Souma’s stomach with as
much force as his physical prowess allowed. The boy fell to the ground in a
loud and painful cry, his mouth gushing out sprays of blood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Tsubasa thought that his little brother would give in after
he had demonstrated how far his powers were above the boy’s. Tsubasa thought
that once he had disabused the boy’s hope that he could be defeated, Souma
would surrender and accept Tsubasa’s invitation to come back to the Dark God’s
ranks. Tsubasa was wrong. However badly beaten he was, Souma still tried to
stand up and look for Raien even when Tsubasa was not sure the boy could even
pick it up. Seeing his little brother so was just like pouring oil into the
already raging fire.</p>

been babied long enough.”</span></i> Tsubasa kicked Souma and stamped harshly
on his back over and over. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“Because
of my weakness, you become ignorant of how reality works!</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“I was
happy that both of us are servants to the Lord Orochi, I was happy that we
could be family again but you disappointed me,”</span></i> Tsubasa said, trying
to calm himself down. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“To
tell you the truth, Souma, I wanted you to lead a peaceful life where you can
live under the sunshine without worrying where tomorrow may lead. That was why
I left you to the High Priests care in the first place. But then when humanity
failed me, I realized that I have made a terrible mistake. This is a corrupted
world, one that was defiled beyond imagination. And I, as well as my comrades
the Followers, am the only cure it has. I will not allow you to be lead astray
any longer, Souma. By hook or by crook, I shall make you kneel and swear
allegiance to the Lord!”</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Tsubasa grabbed Souma’s throat with his left hand and pulled
his little brother so that Souma’s feet dangling a few inches off the ground. Then
Tsubasa unleashed his Orochi powers into the boy. Eyes trying to bulge out of
his sockets, Souma began to scream at the top of his lungs while his arms and
legs flailed in a most violent manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You have not opened yourself to Raien’s soul far enough,
Souma. Do you really think you can defeat me in such a pathetic state? Please,
do not make me laugh.” Under Tsubasa’s will, Souma’s right hand rose up. Out of
the five trembling fingers, purple lightning jagged outward and materialized
into Raien the Lightning Blade, the one sword beside Hokuto that possessed the
powerful Voice of Sorrow. “As your elder brother, Souma, allow me to help.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“What... are you going... to do, Tsubasa-nii-san....?” Souma
managed between full-throated cries.</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I cannot believe my little brother is such a simpleton.”
Tsubasa sighed. “Of course I am going to remove every restraint you have put on
your Sealed Sword. Then Raien’s darkness will flow into your soul and make you
see the only path to this world’s salvation.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“No!” </span></i>The

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Oh yes!” Laughing in satisfaction, Tsubasa reached deep into
Souma’s soul and shattered all the barricades that the kid had put up to
prevent Raien’s inevitable invasion. Now that they were gone, there was nothing
that could stop the hatred that the Lightning Blade harbored, the anger of the
Orochi’s heart!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Get away from Oogami-san,” a cold voice of a girl said
quietly at the same time a bar of liquid silver light streaked at Tsubasa from
his right-hand side. Without taking his eyes off the thrashing Souma, Tsubasa
calmly lifted Hokuto up to parry the attack. The bar of light, upon touching
the crooked edge of the Star Blade, shattered into a million sparkling pieces. <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>The power of the Moon, </span></i>he
thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Tsubasa turned his head and looked for the people who dared
stick their nose into his business. To his right, at least ten feet away from
him, stood two beautiful girls who were encompassed by glorious auras of silver
and gold. They were, without a doubt, the Priestesses of the Sun and Moon. The
Priestess of the Sun, whose golden aura was most brilliant under the starlit
skies, was standing next to the other girl, the raised hand of whom was still
glowing silver in the dark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Let go of him, please!” the golden-haired girl pleaded. Ever
as she spoke, her aura began to pulse powerfully, filling the air between them
with as much warmth and illumination as a thousand light bulbs could provide.
Tsubasa could even smell his hand at Souma’s throat burn in that aura. Gradually,
the hatred with Raien fled from Souma’s soul back into its hiding place within
the sword. The girl’s holy powers were interfering with his, Tsubasa realized.
At this rate, it was no longer possible for Tsubasa to turn Souma to the dark
side. Fury hissed in him like a viper whose territories had just been
trespassed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“You!” </span></i>Tsubasa
roared, tossing Souma on the ground like a sack of meat. <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“How dare you meddle in my business?
You shall pay!”</span></i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Tsubasa directed Hokuto toward the intruders. Quickly, the
Moon Priestess stationed herself in front of the other girl and formed a
barrier made entirely from silver aura in front of her raised hand. <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Foolish, </span></i>Tsubasa thought.
There was no barrier strong enough to block an Elemental Blade, which she should
have learned that from Nekoko already. Tsubasa found himself smiling a vicious
smile. The Lord Orochi forbade the Followers to kill the two Kannazuki
Priestesses but He did not mention anything about not hurting them, did he?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Stop that, Tsubasa-nii-san!” Winds rushed at Tsubasa from
behind. He leapt upward and suspended his body in the air just in time to evade
Raien’s deadly slash. “If you make one scratch on Himeko, I’ll...” threatened
his little brother, who had somehow managed to recover the Lightning Blade. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You will do what, Souma? Kill me, perhaps?” Tsubasa laughed
bitterly. “Ever since the beginning of this fight, you have never thrown any
fatal blows at me and now you threatened me because of some girl? Do you even
see me as your family, Souma? Well, do you?” he demanded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I do, nii-san. But whoever you are, I won’t let you lay one
finger on Himeko!” The boy looked at the Priestess of the Sun, smiling an
awkward smile that was returned with a blank look and a flushed face. “You said
you had no reason to protect this world, but I do. Because this is where the
girl I love lives. For her, I will fight with my life to keep it safe!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“You
ungrateful child, I saved you from that abyss just for this?” </span></i>Tsubasa
snarled. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“There is no reason
for you to live anymore, Souma. I will kill you myself!” </span></i>He
levitated himself even higher up into the sky, from where the two girls and his
little brother looked as a rock pebble.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“Heavenly
Seven – Rain of the Shining Flames!”</span></i> Tsubasa raised Hokuto overhead
and focused his full power into the Star Blade. The night clouds began to move
inward in circles, drawing seven whirlpools of clouds that were arranged the
shape of the great guiding stars, Hokuto <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Shichisei</span></i>.
From the center of each, white light flooded out as if there was a sun hidden
within. Soon, seven destructive pillars of light would rain down upon the earth
and destroy his little brother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Down on the ground, something... inexplicable was happening. Raien,
vibrating strongly in the hands of Tsubasa’s brother, was shining as brightly as
noonday. Not only that, the Lightning Blade was brimming with so much power it
was now on the same level with Hokuto, strongest of the Elemental Blades.
Incredulity seized him and rendered him speechless. How in the Lord’s name did
Souma gain complete control over his sword even though he had never accepted Raien’s
soul into his own? The explanation came to Tsubasa when his eyes found Himemiya
Chikane and Kurusugawa Himeko, both of whom were still enveloped in their
sacred light. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>The Light of
the Priestess earlier!</span></i> he thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Souma gave a violent start as the purple sun in his hand
suddenly exploded. Blinding light overwhelmed the world. In spite of himself,
Tsubasa had to cover his eyes with his hands. However, even when he could not
see a thing, he was able to sense a great power being born, one that surpassed
what Tsubasa possessed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Several seconds later, the light faded away... and Tsubasa’s
returning vision gave birth to gut0wrenching terror. Around him now slithered a
gigantic dragon in its monstrous serpentine form, which appeared to be made
purely out of lightning. The creature had four limbs and two wings with
lightning bolts for feathers, which seemed to stretch to the furthest corners
of the earth. Its head, large as any truck Tsubasa had ever seen was not that
far away from him at all. The dragon was opening its toothy mouth, within which
a huge sphere of light was being generated. The Lord Orochi once revealed to
Tsubasa that the highest level of power a Follower could obtain from the Sealed
Swords was to summon their True Forms. So this was what the Dark God meant. If
Tsubasa recalled correctly, the name of this creature... was <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Raien</span></i> <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>no Ryuu</span></i>. The Lightning
Dragon itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“Tsubasa-nii-san!
Leave or else!”</span></i> Souma bellowed. The look of confidence on the boy’s
ace told Tsubasa that his little brother had realized he could control the True
Form of his Sword.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Tsubasa said nothing has he pointed his Hokuto once more at
the Priestesses. He had no intention of leaving here with tail behind his legs.
In his hand, The Star Blade glowed, ready to unleash ‘<i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Rain of the Shining Flames</span></i>
upon the two girls who had spoiled his planned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:.15in;margin-right:35.25pt;margin-bottom:
.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>“Fire!”</span></i>
Souma shouted, and the Lightning Dragon roared. The huge sphere in its mouth
became a pillar of liquid light that rushed straight toward Tsubasa. He simply
stared at his impending doom, thinking to himself how it had come to this.
However, moments before the pillar could consume his body, a slender figure of
a young girl appeared right in front of him. The girl, clad in a long black
cape took his hand into hers and said quietly, “I believe this is the first
time we meet, First Head. I am Saotome Makoto, the Eighth Head. Glad to make
your acquaintance.”</p>

.15in;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>With
all of his strength consumed by the dragon that Raien had morphed into, Oogami
Souma collapsed onto the ground and started to gasp for breaths. In one last
flash of purple light and a thunderous roar over his head, the dragon reverted
into the shape of the Lightning Blade, which then melted into the light of the
dawning sun. Souma allowed himself a quiet smile. He had come here, knowing
that he was fighting at best a losing battle. He had thought that a very slim
chance was all he had against his blood brother, the wielder of the Star Blade.
But who could have guessed Raien, claimed to be weaker than Hokuto itself,
would provide him with the means to conclude the fight in <i><span
style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>his</span></i> favor? Souma sighed. He
only hoped Tsubasa-nii-san was okay. Although he had ordered Raien’s monstrous
manifestation to attack the older man, he had secretly held back most of its
power. The best the dragon could have done to Souma’s brother would be burning
the man in a few places and that was it. </p>

smile. <i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>Even though I had to
fight my own brother, it did not matter much. As long as I can keep you safe
and sound, Himeko, there’s no price I’m not going to pay, </span></i>was the

whole.</p>
