&quot;Ok folks, here are the next women to be on our show!!!&quot; Toya the 
announcer said.

The fans cheered and cheered. &quot;Go Triela.&quot; and &quot;YAY Henrietta!&quot; or &quot;WOO 
HOO Rico!&quot;

&quot;For the next 7 weeks, you 3 girls will live in a house together and 
during the day you will do different activities,&quot; Toya smiled.

The 3 girls stood meakly on stage. Triela finally spoke up, &quot;Can we get 
to the house now?&quot;

They were led off stage and driven to their new home (for 7 weeks 
at least). They looked up at a huge 5 story house. The girls got out of 
the car and the car drove down the road faster than it came.

&quot;What do we do now Triela?&quot; Henrietta asked.

Triela put an arm around her and kissed her forehead, &quot;Let&#39;s just go in.&quot;

Rico followed the girls into the house. Triela and Henrietta&#39;s eyes got 
huge as they looked inside.

&quot;Wow this is kewl!!!&quot; Rico said.

Triela let go of Henrietta as she ran up the stairs. &quot;I see 5 floors.&quot;

Henrietta grabbed her hand and began to pull her up the stairs. Up and 
up they went, higher and higher. Finally they reached the top and fell to 
the floor out of breath.

They sat up and shivered. &quot;Why is it cold? It&#39;s usually hot on the highest 
floor.&quot;

They got up and each climbed on one side of rail and slid down. As they 
reached the bottom floor it got warmer. They jumped off the rail and 
walked around. They walked into a huge bedroom bigger then the rest they 
had seen. &quot;I call this one!!!&quot; Henrietta yelled.

&quot;How &#39;bout we share this room?&quot; Triela smiled.

&quot;Ok.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take the room next to this one.&quot; Rico glared at Henrietta.

Triela looked at Rico and smiled, &quot;Okay, but please no more glaring.&quot;

Rico walked out of the room.

Triela grabbed Henrietta and pulled her onto the king-size bed. She 
moved the hair out of Henrietta&#39;s eyes and kissed her. Triela then 
smiled down at her. Henrietta smirked then frenched Triela, her tounge 
slipping into her mouth.

&quot;You&#39;re so cute Henrietta,&quot; Triela smiled.

&quot;You are too.&quot; Henrietta smiled back.</pre>
