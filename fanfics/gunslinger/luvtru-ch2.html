Rico walked into the room next to where Henrietta and Triela were. The 
room was slightly smaller then their room but she didn&#39;t care.

&quot;Henrietta is so lucky,&quot; Rico said to herself.

She tossed herself onto the bed and laid there. She stared at the 
ceiling. The room started spinning and Triela&#39;s voice was the only thing 
she could hear.

                          ~~~~~~~~~~

Triela and Henrietta heard a sound come from the hall and they got up to 
go check it out.

&quot;Hello???&quot; Triela said poking her head out of the door.

Henrietta walked over and knocked on Rico&#39;s door, &quot;Rico was it you that we 
heard out here?&quot;

                           ~~~~~~~~~~

Rico just laid on the bed. She couldn&#39;t hear a thing going on around 
her. She sat up on the bed and swayed back and forth.

Something was wrong with her but she couldn&#39;t tell. Something in the 
house had done something to her, but she had no idea.

                           ~~~~~~~~~~

Henrietta pounded on the door. Triela walked up behind her and grabbed 
her hand, &quot;I guess it was nothing love, just our imagination.&quot; She wrapped 
her arms around Henrietta.

Hennrietta smiled, &quot;Okay, I guess you&#39;re right.&quot;

They walked back into their bedroom Triela&#39;s arms still around 
Henrietta.

They heard a thud come from the room next to them and they bolted out of 
their room once again.

                            ~~~~~~~~~~

Rico had fallen to the floor and lay unconscious.

                             ~~~~~~~~~~

Henrietta and Triela pounded on Rico&#39;s door, but nothing happened.

&quot;I&#39;m going in,&quot; Henrietta took a gun out of her belt and shot a bullet 
through the handle of the door. She ripped into the room and ran over to 
Rico. &quot;What the hell kind of show is this???&quot;

Triela ran in behind Henrietta and looked over her shoulder.

                          ~~~~~~~~~~

Toya then rushed in and over to Rico, &quot;She came into the room as planned 
ladies and gents. She is unconscious and her friends came for her!!! Truly 
a beautiful job.&quot;

Henrietta and Triela look at each other in confusion. Triela grabbed Toya 
and looked into his eyes, &quot;What did you do to her???&quot;

Henrietta stared down at him meekly watching Triela, &quot;We just sprayed a 
kind of gas in here to make her fall unconcious!!! and It Worked!&quot; Toya 
released himself from her grip.

                         ~~~~~~~~~~

&quot;We&#39;ll find them,&quot; Guiseppe spoke into his cellphone.

&quot;You better those girls are all we have in our section,&quot; a voice came 
through.

 &quot;I&#39;ll get them.&quot;

                         ~~~~~~~~~~

Triela and Henrietta stood there while people they didn&#39;t know put their 
hands all over Rico.</pre>
