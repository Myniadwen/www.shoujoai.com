Fuka Academy Student Council

Dear Mai,

I was happy, joyous and cheerful to get your letter as part of the 
information exchange that President Kanade set up between our two 
private schools. I also saw your attached photo and was impressed, 
shocked and stunned over your terrific body! You must have to beat the 
guys off with a stick! Or the girls, if what I hear about some of your 
council is true.

On the other hand, I&#39;m not one to talk. Part of why I agreed, wanted and 
was willing to write back to you is that we seem to have some things in 
common. In your letter you talked a lot about your young roommate, 
Mikoto, and her being a swordswoman, and that really struck a chord in 
me. You see, my best friend is also a swordswoman!

Sayuri Hida and I have been friends, chums and buddies since we were 
both small children. I was nearly raised in her family&#39;s dojo after my 
dad took off, and I&#39;ve been by her side through both good times and bad 
ones. But recently she&#39;s been drawn away from me a little, mostly 
because of a new female friend.

I should add that I&#39;m not prejudiced against same sex couples. Why, when 
we thought President Kanade and Rino Rando were sleeping together, I was 
one of their biggest supporters, boosters and fans! And I&#39;ve known about 
our teammate Kaori Izumi&#39;s crush on Kanade for years, but I&#39;ve never 
teased her, bugged her or made her feel bad about it. Not only that, but 
I get yearly subscriptions to the Takarazuka Revue!

If I were to be honest, I guess I&#39;m worried I&#39;m going to lose Sayuri to 
this girl. I&#39;ve never really thought about being in love with another 
woman, but I do know that I care for her very much. It could be that 
I&#39;ve had some unknown, hidden and mysterious feelings for Sayuri, but I 
never realized it? And if that&#39;s so, what do I do about it?

I&#39;m sorry I blabbed so much about my personal problems. I had meant to 
ask all about Fuka Academy, how big it is, the sort of students it has 
and if you thought a poker game there would be well received. I&#39;m a bit 
of a card games fan and would love to bring my games to Fuka, too. And 
do you think the Executive of your student council would disapprove? Any 
information would be helpful.

From Rein Tsunomoto

Miyagami Academy Maximum Authority Wielding Best Student Council

Notes: Rein has a odd habit in conversations to repeat things three 
times, but using different words. Tried to work that in here a bit, 
hopefully not TOO much. Rein is also a card shark &amp; a cheat, so her 
interest in bringing card games to Fuka probably isn&#39;t a good thing. ^_~
