Miyagami Academy Maximum Authority Wielding Best Student Council

Dear Kanade

I very much enjoyed meeting you and your student council at the regional 
meeting in Tokyo. While we&#39;ve shared a great deal in our letters, it&#39;s 
quite a different thing meeting face to face. I was quite impressed with 
both you and your people, and have found my own thoughts turning to a 
similar organization at my own school.

As we&#39;ve discussed before Fuka Academy has it&#39;s share of unusually 
capable individuals, but any suggestions on organizing my staff would be 
appreciated. The simplest organization will likely be the attack squad, 
which I intend to have Haruka Suzushiro head. I know I&#39;ve mentioned that 
Haruka is occasionally impetuous and short sighted, but I think I can 
balance that out by putting Yukino Kikukawa in charge of my intelligence 
gathering in the covert squad.

To be honest I almost have too many people available for the assault 
squad. Mikoto Minagi is a very dangerous swordswoman, though I would be 
forced to include Mai Tokhia to keep her under control. Also my dear 
Natsuki would be a qualified applicant, along with Midori Sugiura.

Sadly, I lack qualified applicants for the covert squad. I believe I can 
bring Nao Yuuki in if I appeal to her self interest and I think Akira 
Okuzaki might also join, assuming I put it to her properly. Chie Harada 
will be a useful spy and covert agent, but she lacks even the most basic 
combat skills.

My vehicle squad will likely solely consist of school nurse Yohko 
Sagisawa, unless I can convince Natsuki to give me a ride on her 
motorcycle. Having driven with Yohko on a mountain road looking for 
Natsuki, I have to say death no longer holds any terror for me.

We have rarely dipped into personal matters in our letters, but after 
our meeting I feel I must. Putting it simply, do not let Nanaho Kinjo 
get away from you. It was very clear to me how deeply you care for her, 
and also how strongly she feels for you, however neither of you has done 
anything about it. Nanaho is a perfectly charming soft butch, and it 
seems likely that if you don&#39;t grab her someone else will.

Your&#39;s respectfully

Shizuru Fujino

Fuka Academy School Council.
