Fuka Academy School Council Attack Squad

Dear Natsuki

Thank you very much for your advice regarding dealing with Kanade&#146;s 
sudden aggressiveness. I&#146;m not used to the idea of a woman being 
attracted to me, and to be honest I found her forward manner a little 
frightening. She seems to have calmed down a bit after our date, and I 
think things are progressing more normally. Well, as normal as it can 
be, considering our circumstances. Both of us deal with aristocratic 
women, so I think you can understand some of the other difficulties.

I&#146;d also like to apologize for the trouble that meeting the Best Student 
Council seems to have caused you and your fellow Fuka Academy students. 
It seems that your President Fujino is quite determined to form her own 
equivilent to our council at your school. From your last letter I 
understand Haruka Suzushiro has been made co-vice president and is in 
charge of your attack squad. How are you getting along with her? And has 
a decision been made regarding your covert squad?

As to how to get along better with your fellow members of the attack 
squad, I&#146;d suggest maintaining some group activities. Our own assault 
squad plays poker together often, along with other members of the 
student council. You might consider a game&#146;s night, or maybe kareoke?

As a fellow vice president, I also wanted to ask your advice on another 
matter. One of our best assault squad members is Sayuri Hida, a swords 
woman whom accidentally injured one of her teachers before coming to 
Miyagami Academy. She&#146;s recently been confronted by Yoko, the daughter 
of her old teacher, who&#146;s been coming around every few weeks to fight 
her in duels.

On the surface the appear to be enemies, but when Sayuri was in trouble 
Yoko appeared to help. More importantly in between duels they&#146;re going 
out for soda, lunches and other activities. If I didn&#146;t know better, I&#146;d 
think they were dating! What&#146;s your opinion on this?

Anyway, I look forward to receiving your next letter. If you need any 
urgent assistance, call me. Otherwise, I&#146;ll await your reply.

Yours, Nanaho Kinjo
