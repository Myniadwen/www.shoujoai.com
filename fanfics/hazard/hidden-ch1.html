<h1>Hidden</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hazard/index.html">El Hazard</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	I watch as her chest rises and falls more rapidly with each 
breath. She&#39;s having nightmares again. I know this just from looking at 
her. Ever since she was rescued from Galus she hasn&#39;t been the same.
	On the surface, to everyone else, she seems to be the same 
old Fatora. Even Rune Venus doesn&#39;t notice the change. I&#39;m the only 
one that can see it... see her pain.
	She&#39;s moaning softly in her sleep now and her brows are 
drawn in fear. Her thrashing in the bed is strangely gentle. As I know 
her to be, underneath it all.
	My mother once told that the most tender people are the ones 
who appear the hardest on the outside. It&#39;s similar to the Earth saying 
that Makoto taught me.
	Cold hands, warm heart.
	That saying fits her so very well but it isn&#39;t her hands that are 
cold, rather it&#39;s her persona that is.
 	I form a slow smile and move closer as I wind my fingers into 
her hair. She instantly calms at my touch and gives a soft sigh as she 
curls on her side.
	Asleep she&#39;s the angel that I know her to be.
	When she&#39;s awake she becomes a monster of sorts. A person 
that isn&#39;t entirely of my liking and doesn&#39;t have any of my love.
	I can still remember the day that we met. There was the sweet 
scent of flowers in the air and I was so occupied with gathering them 
that I never saw the transport approach.
	Then suddenly, a voice asked me, &quot;Why do you gather the 
flowers?&quot;
	When I turned around there she was. Her Royal Highness, the 
Princess Fatora of Roshtaria. I was stunned to see her standing in front 
of me and immediately froze.
	Although Fatora didn&#39;t seem harsh the guards that surrounded 
her made me freeze in terror. Sensing this she dismissed them with a 
few short words and they departed to watch her at a distance, her 
having only Ura for protection.
	Meeting our eyes she repeated simply, &quot;Why do you gather 
the flowers?&quot;
	I remember my reaction quite well... I gave a nervous laugh 
that she quirked an eyebrow at. On seeing this I became silent then 
answered, &quot;I love their beauty.&quot;
	She considered this for a moment before she smiled in 
understanding and said, &quot;You love their beauty and wish to have it for 
yourself.&quot;
	&quot;Well,&quot; I said in slight hesitation. &quot;I guess you could say that. 
But it&#39;s more that I love their beauty and because of that love I want 
them near me.&quot;
	&quot;Ah,&quot; she said in slow almost sensual tones. She studied me 
with those burning brown eyes and took a slight step closer. &quot;What is 
your name?&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m Alielle,&quot; I replied quickly. &quot;Your Highness!&quot;
	She chuckled quietly then waved her hand in a lazy movement. 
&quot;No formalities please,&quot; she said as she gave me an intense study. 
&quot;You may call me Fatora.&quot;
	There was a long moment of lingering silence before she 
moved even closer and I could feel her breath hit my skin. I remember 
that I shuddered when she touched my chin to tip it upwards. When 
our eyes met she smiled and I&#39;ll never forget what she said next.
	&quot;Alielle,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;I love your beauty and because of 
that love I want you near me.&quot;
	I can still hear the sound of thunder that echoed in my mind as 
I heard this. After a moment my wits returned and stammering I said, 
&quot;B-but... why? I mean... why?&quot;
	Another small smile was her only reply before she lowered her 
face so our lips were almost touching. &quot;Alielle,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Come 
with me, to the palace.&quot;
	&quot;Yes,&quot; I breathlessly gave my answer.
	When we reached the palace the staff didn&#39;t know what do 
make of me and neither did I. She hadn&#39;t given me any position and 
whenever anyone, even myself, would ask her why I was there her 
response was always the same.
	&quot;I want her near me.&quot;
	She suddenly twists in bed and gives another tortured moan of 
distress. I pull her closer to me as I wind myself into her embrace. She 
sighs in contentment as I press my face into the crook of her neck.
	After hours of tossing and turning perhaps she has finally 
calmed. Sleep has become difficult since her return and I often long for 
the days when she carried fewer burdens in her heart.
	Part of me blames myself for her kidnapping. It was the first 
time since the day that we met that I left her side. I left her and when I 
did... she was taken from me.
	I know that she doesn&#39;t blame me for her kidnapping. I know 
that she doesn&#39;t blame anyone really. Not even Ura. It wasn&#39;t she who 
said that. It was her mask. The thick mask she wears to hide and 
protect her true self.
	Maybe it was the life of public scrutiny that made her distrust 
people so. Or maybe it was the fact that her entire life she was made 
to be the lesser of the two sisters.
	Whatever it was, it made Fatora hide her heart behind the wall 
that is her mask. And she has hidden it so well that at times I think that 
I won&#39;t be able to find it anymore.
	Her breathing is even and steady as she curls even closer to 
me, attempting to meld our bodies into one. At this I smile softly and 
caress her back.
	Often, when she isn&#39;t around, the others will build up their 
courage and ask me why I stay with her. Why I put up with, what 
seems to them, the constant verbal abuse.
	And for a reply I always smile then say.
	&quot;I want her near me.&quot;

-End-
	
Both characters in this fanfiction are from El Hazard. I just finished 
watching this series again and like before I was so damn disappointed 
to have Fatora turn out... well. Bitchy. Being something of an optimist I 
wanted to show her more sensitive side and here it is. It&#39;s sort of a 
mushy fic I know but I just couldn&#39;t help it. I want so much to believe 
that there&#39;s a nice person lurking underneath that snotty persona 
Fatora presents.
