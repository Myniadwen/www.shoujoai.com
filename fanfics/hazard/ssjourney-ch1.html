<h1>Sheila Sheila's Journey</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hazard/index.html">El Hazard</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/fade.html">Fade</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;What would she do without me?&quot; asked herself Afura Mann, air&#39;s high 
priestess of Muldoon. She flew after her workmate, Sheila Sheila, the
fire&#39;s high priestess.

&quot;Really Sheila, you should learn to behave. You already have such a bad
reputation among our pilgrims. What would they think about you falling
down a hill like that? &quot;She proposed her hand to help the red-spiky-
haired priestess to stand up.

The said red-head ignored her hand and growled &quot;That&#39;s none of your 
concern!&quot; She straightened her dress and cleaned the dust off. &quot;By the
way, what are you doing here? you certainly don&#39;t follow me to blame me
for my manners!&quot;

&quot;Actually, I decided I would visit some of the libraries I supervise and
see if I could find something to help Makoto. I figured it&#39;d be less
boring if I accompanied you. &quot;The black-haired girl replied. She added
in a whisper, but loud enough for Sheila to hear &quot;...And make sure you
wouldn&#39;t bet your temple in a stupid money game again.&quot;

&quot;Hey! I heard that! You...&quot; She interrupted herself when she saw the
wide smile painted on Afura&#39;s face. &#39;That woman! Why does she keep
going under my skin?&#39; She turned around and began to walk down the
hill.&quot; Humpff! Do as you want!&quot;

With an even wider smile, the black-haired girl joined her friend. They
walked in silence, each one admiring the beautiful landscape in the
sunset. From time to time, Afura threw quick glances toward her
companion. Which didn&#39;t go unnoticed by the fire&#39;s priestess. She didn&#39;t
know why, but it gave her a weird feeling.

&quot;What&#39;s with you?&quot; she finally asked Afura.

&quot;Mmmh? Oh! Err, I was thinking we should find a place to rest. It&#39;s 
almost the night...&quot;

&quot;Oh I see! Not used to walk, isn&#39;t it? You spend too much time with your
books! And when you&#39;ve got to go somewhere you just fly. If you go on
like this you&#39;ll soon be as round as a ball.&quot; She twirled and took a
pose. &quot;While I&#39;ll still be as beautiful as ever!&quot; The last sunrays were
playing on her well-tanned skin and gave her blue eyes golden sparkles.
Indeed, she was breathtaking. She looked like a goddess and Afura 
couldn&#39;t take her eyes off her.

Sheila frowned, usually, Afura&#39;d have retorted something nasty. There, 
she just stared blankly at her, probably eating every flies of the 
surrounding. Her friend was definitely strange today. Anyway, she was 
right, the night was falling fast and... - GROWWLL... - ...she was 
starving to death!

Afura snapped out of wherever she was. &#39;Ohh! Wonderful, Afura! Really 
smooth! Why don&#39;t you drool in front of her, when you&#39;re at it? Okay, 
you can still save it, just be your usual stoic yourself, don&#39;t show 
emotions! Piss her off! It&#39;s not difficult, you do this all the time!&#39;

&quot;Oy, who&#39;s the big stomach here? You&#39;re the one who should care about 
her weight with all the things you eat!&quot; With a thoughtful expression, 
she added, &quot;Well, at least you&#39;ll roll much better down the hills!&quot;

The red-head girl grinned, THAT was her Afura! &quot;Then we&#39;ll make 
contests, I&#39;ll win of course! Particularly if you&#39;re as slow as today, 
I almost thought I&#39;d have to train turtles to drag you along.&quot;

&quot;They are lucky you didn&#39;t have to, you&#39;d have eaten them!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but only after you killed them with your fat ass!&quot;

Both of the girls threw daggers at each other, then broke in laugh and 
finally shivered. Nights were still fresh in this season. They decided 
to camp before entering the deep forest. Afura set up the tent and 
Sheila lit up the fire. Then the black haired girl took care of the 
food - she had better if she wanted to eat anything, no matter what her 
red-head friend said - while the other girl left to fetch some water to 
the near river.

When Sheila came back, she handed two beautiful fishes to the cooker 
and sat next to her.

&quot;Whoa, how did you get them? They&#39;re gonna complete our meal very 
nicely!&quot;

Her red-head friend smiled &quot;Remember when I told you about my life 
before I forced the academy&#39;s doors? I used to take care of myself, if 
I wanted to eat, I&#39;d better be resourceful.&quot; Her gaze got distant &quot;I 
guess there are things you never forget...&quot;

Afura looked at her friend, she had never told anyone why she lived 
alone at that time, she never talked about any family members. What had 
happened she had to stuff it so deep in herself? Afura remembered the 
days back at the priest&#39;s academy. That wasn&#39;t only the hunger that 
prevented the red-head girl to sleep - even if herself had to admit the 
food was really a pity - but awful nightmares. Every nights her fiery 
friend woke up, panting and sweating. What had definitely not helped 
was the way the other students treated her. No one would help her, 
comfort her.

They all looked down at her because of the way she entered the academy.

They said the high priest allowed her to stay because he took pity of 
her, but that she could never be more than a mere servant&#39;s temple. All 
this grieves, instead of breaking her down made her tougher, steeling 
her resolve to be a fire&#39;s high priestess. But it also closed her off. 
Since then, she always showed a cheerful and careless face to anybody. 
But the nightmares were still there...all Afura could do for her was 
to be there and hope she would let it go one day. She wanted so badly 
to help her, it was amazing how she had grown attached to this fool 
girl! So much that she...

&quot;Sooo, you never answered me,&quot; she said when resuming her meal. &quot;Are 
you on a love&#39;s trip?&quot;

Sheila choked with her bread, turned bright red and had to drink half 
her flask to swallow it. &quot;Gargle...hack! Wha-wha-what -hips!- are ya 
-hips!- talking about?-Hips! Of cour-hips!-not-hips! I&#39;m above -hic!- 
those things -hips! hips!...&quot;

&quot;There, there...&quot; The air-priestess patted her friend&#39;s back. &quot;Breathe
deeper and your hiccup should stop...&quot;

&quot;Stop -hips!- mothering me! -hips- I can handle -hic!- this by myself!&quot;

Afura reached a hand and stroked her friend&#39;s cheek. &quot;I know... You 
always had...&quot; She whispered. Then she got up and went in her tent, 
leaving a very dumbfounded Sheila behind her. &#39;What WAS THAT?!?&#39; she 
wondered. Why such gentleness all of a sudden? Sheila couldn&#39;t 
understand this at all. she could even less understand the sudden 
warmth in her heart. She smiled unconsciously, hugged herself and 
closed her eyes.

Little she knew that in her tent, Afura was asking herself the same 
question.

&#39;WHAT did I do, dammit ! But I just couldn&#39;t help myself! Am I 
becoming insane or something?&#39; She shook her head. &#39;She&#39;s just a 
close friend... Right? I wouldn&#39;t want her to go all weird around me 
because of this incident, would I? Oooooh, Spirits, what&#39;s happening to 
me?&#39;

Again, she couldn&#39;t help herself and spread one side of her tent to 
peek on her friend. The fire priestess was curled up close to the fire. 
Could she be already asleep, wondered Afura. Cautiously, she crawled 
out of her shelter to have a better look. Indeed, Sheila was fast 
asleep, a little smile tugging at her lips.

She was so cute like this, seeming so carefree...at last at peace. The 
air priestess stared at her a long time this night. Until the fire 
almost died, actually. She then noticed she was almost frozen.

&#39;She must be cold too!&#39; she said to herself, her eyes widening. She 
looked for Sheila&#39;s bag and once she found it, pulled out the thickest 
blanket. When she neared her sleeping friend, she could see her 
shivering, a slight frown appearing on her tanned face.

Afura wrapped carefully the red-head in the blanket, but the frown 
remained and got even worse. The fire priestess trashed a bit. Afura 
realized that Sheila probably had one of her nightmares. Out of 
instinct, she reached down and ran a light hand  in the messy hair of 
her friend. In the meantime, she whispered soothing words.

After two minutes, the red-head calmed down and went back to a 
peacefull sleep. Almost in a trance, the air priestess bent down and 
kissed lightly her friend&#39;s forehead. Then, she settled back watching 
the sleeping girl.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The next morning, Sheila found herself next to the now extinguished 
campfire. She was startled, she didn&#39;t remember when she had fallen so 
easily asleep, she even didn&#39;t have any of her usual nightmares. How 
could that be? Then she realized she was tucked in a thick blanket. She 
didn&#39;t remember pulling it out of her bag. &quot;Afura?&quot;

&quot;Oh, good morning, slept well?&quot;

The voice came from behind her, she rolled on herself to see her 
friend. &quot;Better than ever, err, thanks for the blanket...&quot;

&quot;Why, you&#39;re welcome... &#39;Seems I can&#39;t stop myself mothering you!&quot; 
Grinned the black-haired girl.

&quot;Well, I certainly wouldn&#39;t complain this time,&quot; she extracted 
herself out of the blanket. &quot;And would my new found parent have 
prepared the breakfast, by any chance?&quot; she asked playfully.

Afura sighed dramatically. &quot;Ahh, children, you bleed for them and all 
they do is asking you for food!&quot; Oh no! Sheila was giving her her most 
studied puppy dog face! The air priestess gave up. &quot;All right, all 
right, but you better go cleaned up or else I won&#39;t make you anything!&quot;

&quot;Yay!&quot;

The air priestess watched her friend stretch herself like a cat. She 
let her eyes travel along her graceful curves, almost feeling the soft 
skin under her fingers, the silkiness of her hair...she averted her 
gaze in an angry motion. What was she doing? She wasn&#39;t supposed to act 
like that, she was a high priestess, damnit! If she kept on like this, 
she &#39;d become as nut as princess Fatora and Alielle.

&quot;Hurry up! The sun is already high in the sky!&quot;

&quot;What? Bullshit, you&#39;re right! Why did you let me sleep that long?!?&quot;

&quot;A twister wouldn&#39;t have woken you up!&quot; No way she&#39;d admit she&#39;d 
enjoyed watching her sleep, and even less to herself.

The red-head ran to the river and came back a few minutes later to wolf 
her breakfast down. Then they packed their belongings and entered the 
forest.

It was one of those old, deep and very dark forest, the kind of you 
found in every good fairy tale, filled with monsters, witches and the 
Spirits knew what else. Why in the hell had Sheila to take this way? It 
would be much faster - and safer - if she let her take them both in the 
air. But noooo! Sheila had to be more stubborn than a bugrom and she 
wouldn&#39;t change her mind, whichever pleas Afura would come up with!

They walked for what seemed hours to Afura, pausing occasionnaly. They 
were apparently headed south-east. They finally reached  a clear at the 
bottom of a high hill under wich went on the river they had been 
following all along. On the other side of the river stood a humble and 
old house with the remnants of a garden beside it. This house was 
obviously abandoned for a very long time. Afura wondered what could 
have possibly driven her friend to come here. She glanced at the fire 
priestess.

The later had just turned around, her face more expressionless than 
ever, though, her jaws were firmly closed. Sheila walked until she 
reached a place on the opposit side of the house, across the river, 
where the forest was beginning again. Then she kneeled and began to 
clean a particular spot, cutting wild grass, pushing away old arm tree 
that had fallen there...

Afura came up behind her to see what was up. When she realized what it 
was her friend was cleaning, her eyes got wide. Wordlessly, she sank to 
her knees too and helped the red-head in her task.

Once it was resumed, they both stood back up and stayed like this, 
somberly silent, staring at the single grave before them, for a long 
while. The gravestone was a very simple one, and time hadn&#39;t been kind 
with it, but one could still read the name of the person who lied 
there: Muthani Sheila.

Finally the fire priestess talked. It was barely above a whisper, as if 
she was afraid to disturb the last slumber of the person who rested 
here.

&quot;It was a long time since I last saw you, wasn&#39;t it? But I know that 
wherever I go, you&#39;re there, with me, watching me, protecting me...I 
still miss you so terribly, but I&#39;ve got great friends now. One came 
with me. Mother, this is Afura...&quot;

She looked at the air priestess who seemed to have a hard time keeping 
her feelings in check.

&quot;...Afura, this is my mother...&quot;

Not waiting for a reaction she turned back towards the grave. &quot;We know 
each other since our days at the Academy. She&#39;s watching over me too 
and she&#39;s very kind, even if she&#39;s a bit stuck up. She spends too much 
time in her library, if you ask me...&quot; She smiled softly.

&quot;I hope you&#39;re fine and that you don&#39;t worry too much about me. I 
remember you telling me it was dangerous to act without thinking when I 
did something stupid. But I&#39;m still your little devil and I don&#39;t see 
myself change. I&#39;m just praying I&#39;m not too much of a disappointment to 
you...&quot;

At this point, Afura&#39;s head jerked up and tears fell freely from her 
eyes. She struggled to keep herself from embracing her friend and pour 
out all the love she had for the wild girl. Instead, she reached for 
her arm, squizzed it affectionately and said in a throaty voice:

&quot;I think - No, I know for sure that your mother could never be ashamed 
of you. She&#39;s certainly very proud of who you&#39;ve become, of who you 
are!&quot;

Sheila looked at her in surprise, then she gave her friend a smile that 
Afura would forever commit to memory as the most beautiful thing she 
could ever see.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Later, they were preparing the camp for the night.

&quot;Sheila... I want to thank you...&quot;

A slightly startled look appeared on Sheila&#39;s face. &quot;What for?&quot;

Afura took a deep breath. &quot;I want to thank you for sharing this with 
me, especially when I imposed myself to you like I did. You don&#39;t know 
how much it means to me...&quot; &#39;...And how I can&#39;t deny anymore how 
much YOU mean to me,&#39; she added to herself.

Sheila&#39;s feature grew serious. &quot;No...I&#39;m the one who should thank 
you. Your presence made it easier for me. You know, I didn&#39;t come here 
for years, since my mother&#39;s death, actually. I&#39;m not sure I would have 
come all the way here, had I been alone...&quot; Her eyes clouded suddenly 
and she whispered, &quot;I tried many times, but...it...brought too many bad 
memories...&quot; Then, she refocused on her friend. &quot;But I&#39;m glad I could 
do it, thanks to you. You&#39;ve always been there for me, now that I think 
about it. So, thank you...&quot;

Afura felt herself blush to the compliment and she busied herself with 
the food (she was now the official cooker, by mutual agreement). 
&#39;Maybe there&#39;s hope...&#39; She thought. Argh! Na! Stop daydreaming! She&#39;s 
straight! No use to keep your hopes up!&#39;

An akward silence fell upon them and lasted through the whole meal.

The air priestess finally decided to break it, her natural curiosity 
rising back.

&quot;So...how did she...die?&quot;

Looking up to meet Sheila&#39;s eyes, she was shocked by how cold they had 
suddenly become. A chill ran up and down her spine. Sheila&#39;s stare 
reminded her of Ifurita&#39;s, when the demon was still obeying Jinai. 
Afura had never seen this facet of her friend. Usually, when the fire 
priestess was upset, you could see the anger burning in her eyes. She 
shouted, screamed, ran, hit, cried, misused her powers... Anything but 
this. Here she was, stiff like a board, her jaws thight, her gaze 
empty. This was frightening...

Afura couldn&#39;t quite describe it. There were wounded, frustrated 
anger...and deep, endless sadness in those eyes.

Then, in an instant, it was all gone as Sheila averted her gaze.

Afura had to strain her ears to hear what Sheila said next. But it left 
her paralized, while the red-head took off in a dead run, disappearing 
in the forest, away from her. And the words burnt in her confused soul 
like lava: &quot;Don&#39;t mess with my life! Don&#39;t EVER approach me again! 
Leave me alone! I hate you...&quot;

I hate you.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ah, ah! Yes, I&#39;m a real bastard to leave you like this. I&#39;ll probably 
make a suite, but it won&#39;t be anytime soon. This one took me long 
enough! (Months, actually, and it sickens me when I think about all the 
errors I&#39;ve certainly missed, sorry.) Although I hate unfinished fics 
as much as anyone, I need a break from this one. Besides, I&#39;ve got 
other fics in mind... It will certainly be a long time before I can 
post an eventuel next episode, but you know what it is: work, 
life...then, I hope you had a good time with this story anyway, if not, 
well, you&#39;ve probably already closed it a long time ago...

Ja ne!</pre>
