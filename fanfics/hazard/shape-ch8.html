EL-HAZARD: THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME

The Shape of Things So Far-

Amiri asks Makoto to analyse some of her husband&#39;s research notes. Jennown 
Doht
has been made the senior consultant to the new Alpha Priestess. Alielle 
worries
that Rune is putting herself under too much pressure. The Bugrom launch an
attack on Dorusland, slowly advancing through the country. Afura has an
unnerving encounter with Doht, who threatens to expose the fact that the
priestesses withheld information from him if Afura does not give him the
prophecy. On the advice of his generals, Fran refuses offers of outside help 
as
the Bugrom continue through Dorusland. The prophecy is finally translated, 
and
it appears to foretell Ifurita&#39;s death- but Ifurita does not believe it. 
Rune
and Fatora decide to unseal the Eye of God to deter the Bugrom. As the
priestesses perform the ceremony, the Stairway to the Sky begins to explode- 
it
has been sabotaged by the Phantom Tribe. Qawoor is rescued by a second 
Ifurita-
the one first encountered during the battle with Kalia. While she claims to 
have
important information about Sakura, Diva has an announcement of her own- she 
is
dying.

THE SEVENTH MONTH: &quot;GEMINI&quot;

Nanami sat down behind the counter, and surveyed her empty restaurant. Her 
only
company was Parnasse, sitting nearby and clearly bored out of his mind.
&quot;I don&#39;t know why I bothered coming in today,&quot; she sighed. &quot;People obviously
don&#39;t want to eat out at the moment.&quot;
&quot;They&#39;re scared,&quot; Parnasse replied. &quot;People in Roshtaria always felt 
protected
before now. But now that they can&#39;t use the Eye of God...&quot;
Nanami nodded. &quot;I just hope they get over their fear soon. Even Makoto and 
the
priestesses haven&#39;t turned up today.&quot;
&quot;Well, they&#39;re in conference with the princesses at the moment,&quot; said 
Parnasse.
&quot;How come we never get invited to these conferences?&quot; Nanami pondered.
&quot;I suppose,&quot; Parnasse reasoned, &quot;we&#39;re just not important enough.&quot;
&quot;Oh well,&quot; Nanami said. &quot;At least I have you here to keep me company.&quot;
Mycea entered the restaurant.
&quot;Hi,&quot; she called. &quot;I came for my shift... oh, Parny! You&#39;re here!&quot;
Parnasse and Mycea immediately sat down opposite each other, and got down to 
the
important business of staring into each other&#39;s eyes.
&quot;I&#39;ll just be over here...&quot; Nanami called, but neither of them seemed to 
hear.

Ifurita Version Three, or &#39;Three&#39; as she had been nicknamed, stood next to 
her
predecessor in the conference hall. They really were extremely difficult to 
tell
apart- the only way in which one differed from the other was their facial
expressions. Three rarely smiled. Quiet and serious, she never seemed to 
speak
unless it was necessary.
&quot;From what we&#39;ve seen,&quot; Afura began, &quot;Sakura has the ability to drain energy
from others.&quot;
&quot;Apart from Qawoor and Ifurita,&quot; Shayla added.
Three nodded. &quot;Yes. It can be explained. Tell me, how much historical data 
do
you have concerning the Holy Wars?&quot;
&quot;Very little has survived from that period,&quot; Rune replied. &quot;Much of it has
passed into legend.&quot;
&quot;I see,&quot; Three said. &quot;Are you aware of a man named Jahad Ito Arundel?&quot;
Doctor Schtalubaugh looked up. &quot;Yes. His name is mentioned in several of the
ancient texts, mostly in connection to the Eye of God.&quot;
&quot;Arundel was a weapons designer for the First Kingdom, a union of nations 
which
had its seat in what is now Roshtaria,&quot; Three explained. &quot;During the early
stages of the Holy Wars, the First Kingdom was devastated by wave after wave 
of
Demon Gods. In response, Arundel created a Demon God to eclipse all others. 
One
that could mimic attacks used against it, and could only grow stronger with
experience. Ifurita.&quot;
Ifurita turned to Three. &quot;Did he design both of us?&quot;
&quot;We are based upon the same design, so yes. But to begin with there was just 
one
Ifurita. You. Single-handedly you turned the tide of the war, laying waste 
to
whole nations...&quot;
&quot;Yes, yes...&quot; Ifurita said uncomfortably. &quot;I can remember that part.&quot;
&quot;The First Kingdom&#39;s enemies surrendered, on the condition that you were 
sealed
away. By this time, Arundel was already overseeing the construction of a new
weapon, the Eye of God.&quot;
&quot;But I thought you said there was peace,&quot; Makoto interjected. &quot;Why were they
building a weapon like the Eye of God in peacetime?&quot;
&quot;The project had already been underway for some time. Also, the First 
Kingdom
claimed it had a right to defend itself. Privately, the other nations were
furious. One of them managed to steal the plans for Ifurita, and began to 
build
copies, of which I was one. The renewed arms race resulted in another war. 
The
First Kingdom used the Eye of God, but it proved difficult to control. Many 
of
their own people were killed as a result.&quot;
&quot;What happened to Arundel?&quot; Ifurita asked.
&quot;He was disgraced, but more determined than ever to prove himself. He began 
work
on the Absolute Zero Class of Demon God. This type took advantage of a 
dangerous
branch of science known as zero energy physics. It proved too dangerous even 
for
him- when experimenting with dimensional vortices, Arundel was killed. His 
half-
finished creation was sealed away. Somehow, the woman you call Sakura Tamaro 
was
fused with the Demon God upon her arrival here.&quot;
&quot;Well, I know what I find weird,&quot; Fatora cut in. &quot;That out of all the places 
she
could have landed, this Tamaro materialised inside a Demon god. I mean, come
on... what are the chances?&quot;

&quot;What are the chances?&quot; Sakura said chirpily. &quot;It looks like this old castle 
is
really the king&#39;s secret military base. What a stroke of luck!&quot;
&quot;Mmph.&quot; Jinnai grunted a response, just barely acknowledging her existence. 
His
thoughts seemed to be elsewhere as he followed his Demon Idol along the 
dark,
stone-floored corridor, surrounded by a small legion of bugs.
&quot;Gee, I thought you&#39;d be happy,&quot; Sakura snapped irritably. &quot;I mean, here we 
are-
we&#39;ve got this country practically conquered... you could at least show some
enthusiasm.&quot;
Jinnai shot her an icy glare. &quot;Will you lay off, just for a second?&quot;
&quot;Something&#39;s bothering you, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Sakura probed. &quot;I can tell. I&#39;m very
perceptive like that, you know. People would always say to me- &#39;Oh, Sakura,
you&#39;re so perceptive,&#39; and then I&#39;d say...&quot;
&quot;Shut up!&quot; Jinnai demanded.
&quot;See? You&#39;re all irritable. That&#39;s a bad sign. Come on, Katsuhiko. What&#39;s
wrong?&quot;
Jinnai paused. The ramifications of what Diva had told him were playing on 
his
mind constantly, and he desperately wanted to tell someone. Not that it 
would
solve anything, but it would then become someone else&#39;s problem too, and he
could at least extract some pleasure from knowing that they were as worried 
as
he was.
For a moment, he considered telling Sakura there and then. But then he
remembered that he was surrounded by bugs. As far as he was aware, the bugs 
knew
nothing of Diva&#39;s impending fate, and he wasn&#39;t sure what might happen if 
they
found out.
&quot;I&#39;ll... um... tell you later,&quot; he mumbled.

Fran paced. Right now it was the most constructive thing he could do.
&quot;It&#39;s not looking good, majesty,&quot; his lone servant observed.
&quot;Yes, thank you for that insight,&quot; Fran hissed. &quot;God only knows where I&#39;d be
without your razor sharp analysis of the situation!&quot;
The servant looked a little hurt. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, majesty. I was only trying 
to...&quot;
&quot;Don&#39;t! Whatever it is, don&#39;t!&quot; Fran interrupted, his panic growing by the
second. &quot;The Bugrom are going to come bursting in here any minute... all of 
my
generals have... just what the hell happened to them anyway? Do you have any
idea where they went?&quot;
&quot;No, majesty,&quot; the servant said. &quot;They just... went.&quot;
Fran let out a feeble little sigh. Somebody up there really had it in for 
him.
He just couldn&#39;t believe it. One minute his generals were all there. The 
next,
he returned from a visit to the toilet only to discover they were gone.
&quot;They must have scarpered,&quot; he surmised. &quot;Bastards! They were useless 
anyway.
&#39;We can win this war alone,&#39; they told me. &#39;Things might look bad right now, 
but
we&#39;re about to turn the tide.&#39; And now look at us! Up to our necks in 
Bugrom!&quot;
&quot;You... didn&#39;t HAVE to follow their advice,&quot; the servant offered nervously.
&quot;Oh, no. No you don&#39;t,&quot; Fran said defensively. &quot;Don&#39;t you go blaming this on 
me.
It was their fault!&quot;
Heavy footsteps could be heard. A few seconds later, the reinforced door 
flew
from its hinges, aided on its unexpected journey by two large Bugrom.
&quot;Yes, well,&quot; the servant nodded. &quot;It doesn&#39;t really matter now, does it?&quot;
Jinnai and Sakura stepped into the room. Jinnai was still feeling awful, but 
he
decided he might as well do this properly.
&quot;I, Katsuhiko Jinnai, claim this nation on behalf of the Bugrom Empire!&quot; He
looked between the two men. &quot;So... which one of you is King Fran?&quot;
&quot;He is!&quot; Fran said, pointing immediately to his servant.
&quot;What?&quot; the servant responded, horror-struck. &quot;Majesty, I...&quot;
&quot;I think he&#39;s lying,&quot; Sakura advised.
Jinnai nodded, moving closer to Fran. &quot;Yes. This one definitely looks more 
king-
like.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s not me, really!&quot; Fran protested. &quot;He&#39;s the king! Him!&quot;
The servant, now close to tears, cut in. &quot;Your majesty, I&#39;ve been in your
service for almost twenty five years! I&#39;m sorry, but I really must object!&quot;
Sakura joined Jinnai in front of Fran. &quot;You ARE the king, aren&#39;t you?&quot;
&quot;No, no, I&#39;m not!&quot;
&quot;Yes you are, you naughty man,&quot; Sakura said with the tone of a nursery 
school
teacher chastising a three year old for hogging the crayons.
&quot;Take him away,&quot; Jinnai said to the two largest bugs. Duly they obliged,
dragging the king of Dorusland out of the room.

&quot;Three,&quot; Ifurita began, reflecting briefly upon what a strange nickname that
was, &quot;can you explain why I couldn&#39;t attack Sakura?&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied. She turned to the others. &quot;As I explained, both Ifurita 
and
the Absolute Zero prototype were designed and built by the same side. There 
was
always the fear that something might go wrong, and two Demon Gods of the 
same
allegiance could turn upon each other. Every First Kingdom Demon God was 
given a
specific EM sensitivity which prevented it from harming one of its own 
kind.&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t get it,&quot; Makoto said. &quot;Your nation was opposed to the First 
Kingdom. If
your design is the same as Ifurita&#39;s, surely you&#39;d have been unable to fight
their Demon Gods.&quot;
Three nodded. &quot;My manufacturers encountered precisely that difficulty when 
they
created the second Ifurita. She could not engage the First Kingdom&#39;s Demon 
Gods
in combat. When they built me, they had to scrap much of the original
programming and start again. I was free of the directive... although my
operational period was brief.&quot;
&quot;What about me?&quot; Qawoor asked. &quot;Sakura didn&#39;t seem able to attack me. And
Ifurita... just seems to have an adverse reaction to me.&quot;
&quot;Hmm,&quot; Three pondered. &quot;There is one remote possibility... I may be able to
prove it. Ifurita. I want you to attack Qawoor.&quot;
Ifurita gasped. &quot;No!&quot;
Rune frowned. &quot;Explain yourself.&quot;
Three remained unfazed. &quot;I don&#39;t want you to harm Qawoor, Ifurita. Just use 
a
weak attack.&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t think I have any.&quot;
&quot;Access your combative database. Call up attack file zero-zero-zero&quot;
Ifurita paused for a moment. &quot;Oh. I see.&quot;
&quot;It is a weak light-based attack, installed to test your command protocols. 
It
is quite harmless.&quot;
Ifurita looked around nervously. &quot;I don&#39;t know, I... it just doesn&#39;t seem 
right
to attack one of my friends.&quot;
The tiniest hint of frustration became evident in Three&#39;s voice. &quot;If you 
don&#39;t,
I will never be able to prove my theory.&quot;
Qawoor spoke up. &quot;Please, Miss Ifurita. Try it. I&#39;m just as curious as you 
are
about all of this.&quot;
&quot;Well...&quot; Ifurita said reluctantly. &quot;Very well, if you&#39;re sure.&quot;
Qawoor nodded.
Ifurita looked to Makoto. &quot;Makoto?&quot;
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Makoto responded. &quot;Oh... right.&quot;
He handed her the Power Key Staff.
Ifurita pointed the staff at Qawoor.
&quot;Here goes,&quot; she said, and fired.
Or rather, didn&#39;t fire. Suddenly her head was filled with hundreds of error
messages, all competing for dominance. Something unconscious was holding her
back, something almost instinctive. Fighting it wasn&#39;t even an option. And 
then,
for a split second, she saw the face.

The next thing she knew, she was sitting on the floor of the conference 
hall,
with Makoto, Three, Schtalubaugh, the princesses and the priestesses 
gathered
around her.
&quot;I... couldn&#39;t do it,&quot; she said. &quot;Some force within me prevented me from
carrying out the attack.&quot;
&quot;As I suspected,&quot; Three said.
&quot;Would you care to explain?&quot; Afura asked.
Three nodded. &quot;Arundel was a very cautious man, and with good reason. He was
living in politically dangerous times. It&#39;s said that his greatest fear was 
to
fall out of favour with his superiors, and end up dead at the hands of one 
of
his own creations.&quot;
&quot;Like the guillotine,&quot; Makoto commented.
&quot;The what?&quot; Fatora asked.
&quot;It was an old Earth method of execution. The guy who invented it was 
eventually
killed by it.&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; Three said. &quot;Arundel sought to avoid precisely that sort of ironic 
death.
He discovered that he had a genetic marker unique to his family. So he 
secretly
programmed every one of his Demon Gods to recognise that marker, and, if
necessary, pass control of themselves over to him. Or, indeed, any of his 
direct
descendants...&quot;
&quot;Descendants?&quot; Qawoor echoed. &quot;But that must mean...&quot;
&quot;Qawoor, I believe you to be a direct descendant of Jahad Ito Arundel. You
possess his genetic marker, and as a result, none of his creations are able 
to
harm you. If Ifurita&#39;s obedience protocols were still active, I believe you
would also be able to control her- but since they are not, all that she
experiences is a sense of internal conflict when she encounters you.&quot;
Ifurita looked up at Three. &quot;But this doesn&#39;t affect you?&quot;
&quot;No. The urge to protect Arundel and his family was removed from my 
program.&quot;
&quot;And Sakura?&quot;
Three paused. &quot;Good question. She was prevented from attacking Qawoor... but 
she
is only half Demon God. I doubt that Qawoor could control her directly.&quot;
&quot;I have one more question,&quot; Ifurita said. &quot;When I tried to attack Qawoor, I
saw... a face. It was a man I didn&#39;t recognise. Can you explain that?&quot;
&quot;Not conclusively,&quot; Three said. &quot;But one possibility comes to mind. I 
believe it
may have been the face of your creator- our original designer, Jahad Ito
Arundel.&quot;
So, Ifurita thought to herself. That is my creator.
She shuddered. He looked so... unpleasant.
Although, she reasoned, given his occupation, it was perhaps not too 
surprising.

Jinnai and Sakura stood on the deck of the troop transport as it began the 
long
journey back to the hive.
&quot;Wow,&quot; Sakura grinned. &quot;I bet Diva&#39;s gonna be so pleased.&quot;
Jinnai just shook his head. Sakura sighed.
&quot;Are you going to tell me what&#39;s up now?&quot;
Looking around to make sure there were no bugs in earshot, Jinnai then 
leaned in
closer to Sakura.
&quot;It&#39;s Diva,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;She&#39;s sort of... dying. She told me the other
day.&quot;
&quot;Dying of what? Is she ill?&quot;
&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so. I think it&#39;s just natural causes.&quot;
&quot;Oh,&quot; said Sakura. &quot;Bummer.&quot;
&quot;Bummer? Is that all you have to say?&quot;
&quot;What did you expect me to say?&quot; Sakura replied. &quot;I don&#39;t really know Diva. 
She
doesn&#39;t seem to like me anyway. Besides, she doesn&#39;t ever do anything, does
she?&quot;
Jinnai frowned. &quot;That&#39;s not the point. The Bugrom need a queen in order to
survive.&quot;
&quot;So what happens to them after she dies?&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m... uh... not sure,&quot; Jinnai said, ashamed. &quot;And I can&#39;t really ask her,
because... um...&quot;
Sakura smiled knowingly. &quot;Because she thinks you&#39;re a messenger from God, 
who
already knows everything about the Bugrom. Now I understand why you&#39;re so
worried. Wow, this is a tough one...&quot;
&quot;Yeah, yeah. Don&#39;t rub it in. I need to think of a way out of this...&quot;
&quot;Ooh!&quot; Sakura said. &quot;I&#39;ve thought of something!&quot;
&quot;No, you haven&#39;t,&quot; Jinnai said dismissively. &quot;You never think of anything.&quot;
&quot;Shows how much YOU know, Mr Messenger-From-God. I&#39;ve come up with a very 
clever
plan. I&#39;m not as stupid as you think, Katsuhiko.&quot;
For the record, Sakura actually was as stupid as Jinnai thought. On this
occasion, she just got lucky.

Jinnai sidled up to Diva, trying to disguise his fear.
&quot;Look, um, Diva. It&#39;s about what you told me the other day...&quot;
&quot;Yes?&quot;
&quot;Well, as you know, Sakura is a very important part of our operation, and I
think it&#39;s only right that she should know.
Diva paused, considering Jinnai&#39;s words carefully.
&quot;I agree,&quot; she said. &quot;You may tell her.&quot;
&quot;Oh... well...&quot; Jinnai bluffed. &quot;The thing is... Sakura can be very 
emotional
sometimes, and I&#39;m not that good at breaking bad news. I think you should 
tell
her yourself.&quot;
Diva sighed. &quot;If you insist, Mr Jinnai.&quot;
&quot;Excellent. Hey, Sakura. Come over here.&quot;
Sakura approached the pair. Diva decided to get this all over with as 
quickly as
possible.
&quot;Miss Tamaro, I will die soon.&quot;
&quot;I know.&quot;
Jinnai gave Sakura a swift kick.
&quot;Wha... oh... I mean... you&#39;re gonna die? That&#39;s awful! NO!&quot;
Sakura grabbed onto Diva and began to wail uncontrollably.
&quot;Don&#39;t leave us, Diva! Why does the world have to be so cruel?&quot;
Jinnai didn&#39;t know where to look. She was overdoing it... Diva, meanwhile, 
was
quite unaccustomed to this sort of behaviour, and could only look down at 
the
apparently inconsolable Sakura with utter bemusement.
&quot;Miss Tamaro... I&#39;m, well, touched... but I think... um...&quot;
&quot;What did I tell you?&quot; Jinnai said weakly. &quot;She does get emotional.&quot;
Sakura continued to cry.
&quot;Please, Miss Tamaro,&quot; Diva urged. &quot;I think that is enough.&quot;
&quot;Sakura, KNOCK IT OFF!&quot; Jinnai commanded.
Sakura stopped abruptly. &quot;Oh,&quot; she said. &quot;Okay.&quot;
&quot;Now,&quot; Jinnai prompted. &quot;I&#39;m sure after hearing this news, there&#39;ll be a lot 
of
questions you&#39;ll want to ask Diva.&quot;
&quot;Not really,&quot; she replied.
Jinnai kicked her again.
&quot;Ooh! I thought of one!&quot; she said. &quot;How long do you have left?&quot;
&quot;A few months,&quot; Diva replied. &quot;Long enough for me to produce the new queen.&quot;
&quot;I bet you&#39;d like to ask Diva more about this new queen, wouldn&#39;t you?&quot; 
Jinnai
said to Sakura with a murderous look in his eyes.
&quot;Um... yes? Yes, I think I would.&quot;
&quot;Well,&quot; Diva began, &quot;it&#39;s quite simple. I will lay one more egg, containing 
the
new queen. This will hatch, and I will be able to educate my successor in 
the
ways of the Bugrom before I die.&quot;
Jinnai heaved a sigh of relief. This was the information he had been after.
&quot;Oh well,&quot; he said to Sakura, &quot;I think that&#39;s enough questions. Let&#39;s not 
bother
Diva any longer, now.&quot;
He towed her away, trying to contain his anger until they got to a safe
distance.
&quot;I can&#39;t believe you almost messed that up!&quot; he hissed. &quot;Especially 
considering
it was your plan in the first place!&quot;
&quot;Well, it worked, didn&#39;t it?&quot; Sakura said defiantly.
&quot;Sakura, not only can you not sing, you can&#39;t act either. It&#39;s a source of
continual wonder to me that you ever got paid to do anything.&quot;

It was late evening, and Princess Rune walked towards the war room feeling
rested, but at the same time, frustrated. After her audience earlier in the 
day
with the new Ifurita, Fatora and Alielle had practically ordered her to take
some time off. Of course, she&#39;d objected at first, but there was little 
point in
arguing with Fatora. So in the end she&#39;d accepted. And it wasn&#39;t that she 
didn&#39;t
like having time to herself... it was just that she had no idea what to do 
with
it.
As she entered the war room, she noticed how unusually quiet it was.
No wonder. There were few people present. Three generals stood despondently
above the giant map, while Fatora and Alielle sat in the corner.
Rune approached the pair.
&quot;What&#39;s happened?&quot;
Alielle, clearly distressed, looked up. &quot;Dorusland has fallen.&quot;
&quot;Oh my goodness... Alielle, I&#39;m very sorry. When did this happen?&quot;
&quot;We got word about two hours ago,&quot; Fatora replied.
&quot;Right,&quot; Rune began, slipping back into ruler mode. &quot;First we need a strong
deployment of troops along our southern border. Considering the length of 
the
border area, it will probably be necessary to...&quot;
&quot;Sis, it&#39;s done,&quot; Fatora said. &quot;The southern border is being guarded by nine 
of
our own divisions, and four from Styrenia. We&#39;re also trying to contain the
Bugrom inside Dorusland by dispatching troops from Stidiland and Perallia 
along
their eastern border...&quot;
Rune noticed the error immediately. Obviously, Fatora&#39;s inexperience in
international politics had caused her to falter.
&quot;You can&#39;t put Stidian and Perallian troops together,&quot; she said. &quot;There&#39;s a
long-running border dispute between those nations. They won&#39;t co-operate.&quot;
&quot;Border dispute?&quot; Fatora pondered. &quot;Oh, I remember now. Yeah, I sorted that 
out
yesterday.&quot;
&quot;What?&quot;
&quot;Well, I knew nothing about it until yesterday, when we had the king of
Stidiland and the queen of Perallia here... they were angry when they bumped
into each other! They started fighting, and Alielle told me it was because 
they
couldn&#39;t agree on a border. I didn&#39;t have time for it, so I just... drew 
them a
new border. Didn&#39;t I, Alielle?&quot;
Alielle nodded. &quot;They both seemed quite pleased with it.&quot;
Rune didn&#39;t know where to begin. &quot;You solved a three hundred year old border
dispute? How? Who did you give the Horikosh Lakes to?&quot;
Fatora looked puzzled. &quot;Um... I don&#39;t know. I just drew a wiggly line 
between
the two countries. They liked it. Don&#39;t ask me how it worked, but it did.&quot;
&quot;Oh...&quot; Rune said, a hint of disappointment evident in her voice. &quot;Well, is
there anything else for me to do?&quot;
&quot;Not really,&quot; Fatora replied. &quot;We were just about to call it a night here.
Alielle?&quot;
Alielle stood up with Fatora, who held onto her protectively. It had been a 
long
and extremely stressful day for Alielle.
&quot;We&#39;ll see you tomorrow,&quot; Fatora nodded to Rune. The couple walked slowly to 
the
exit.
Rune sat herself down and looked at the near deserted war room. The room 
that
had functioned perfectly well without her input.
Suddenly, she felt thoroughly miserable.

Day 194

Morning. Ugh.
Makoto sat down at the table and tried to focus on the mass of diagrams 
before
him. He had been given the job of reconstructing the damaged Stairway.
Fortunately, he now had Three to help him. Whilst Ifurita remembered little 
of
her past, Three seemed to have an exhaustive knowledge of the weaponry that 
had
once surrounded her.
&quot;Was she up drawing these all night?&quot; he asked drowsily.
&quot;Yes,&quot; Ifurita replied. &quot;Demon Gods don&#39;t need to sleep.&quot;
&quot;But you sleep.&quot;
She smiled. &quot;Only because you do.&quot;
&quot;Where is Three, anyway?&quot;
&quot;She left earlier,&quot; Ifurita said. &quot;She doesn&#39;t seem to enjoy being around 
other
people.&quot;
Makoto sighed. &quot;Well, I wish she was here now. I can&#39;t understand half of 
these
diagrams.&quot;
&quot;You&#39;re too tired at the moment,&quot; Ifurita advised. &quot;Leave them, and come 
back
later.&quot;
&quot;Good idea,&quot; Makoto nodded. He noticed that Ifurita was reading something.
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;
&quot;The research Doctor Amiri gave you last month. It&#39;s really very 
interesting.&quot;
&quot;I still haven&#39;t had a chance to look at it. What&#39;s it about?&quot;
&quot;It proposes a model for using micro-energetic discharges to manipulate 
photons
and create curvatures in space.&quot;
&quot;What?&quot; The concept seemed to ring a bell with Makoto, but he couldn&#39;t quite
figure out why.
&quot;Well, it doesn&#39;t give any specific details,&quot; Ifurita said, &quot;but I think it
might be an explanation of the Phantom Tribe people&#39;s powers.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re absolutely clear on what you have to do?&quot; Miz asked.
&quot;Yes, of course.&quot; Afura nodded, then looked back out at her projected route. 
She
stood on the deck of her small personal transport, about to embark on an
impromptu pilgrimage.
At least, that was the cover story. In reality, she was visiting the Holy 
City
for a more subversive reason. Miz was deeply suspicious of the new Alpha
Priestess, and wanted to find out more about her. But it was notoriously
difficult for anybody other than a senior priestess to get an audience with 
the
Alpha Priestess, so Afura had found herself volunteered.
She didn&#39;t like this. Afura played by the rules. Now it felt as if she was
plotting behind the Alpha Priestess&#39; back.
&quot;Just remember, I want to know about anything you notice that seems 
unusual,&quot;
Miz continued.
&quot;I know, I know,&quot; Afura sighed. &quot;Miz, I really have to be going.&quot;
&quot;Well, good luck then,&quot; Miz called.
Afura didn&#39;t look back. She just wanted to get on with this. She started the
engine and began her flight out of the city.
Miz walked back to her husband, who was staring idly into space.
&quot;Maybe now, we&#39;ll get some answers,&quot; she said.
Fujisawa grunted. &quot;Politics. I&#39;m sick of it.&quot;
&quot;Meaning what?&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Fujisawa sighed. &quot;It&#39;s just... I&#39;ve tried everything I can 
think of
to tackle racism at that damn school. Nobody wants to know. I just... keep
thinking about all the Opaques. They must think that nobody cares. But I 
care...
only I can&#39;t do anything to help. I&#39;m powerless.&quot;
&quot;There&#39;s no need to be so despondent,&quot; Miz said sympathetically. &quot;You have 
to
stop thinking like a teacher. There&#39;s more than one way to help people, and
you&#39;re a respected figure in Roshtaria. People will listen to what you have 
to
say.&quot;

&quot;Geynos are asking for assistance from our army,&quot; Fatora said, reading the
latest of the messages passed on to her. &quot;They&#39;re concerned about their 
border
with Dorusland. I think we can spare some troops. Alielle, what would you 
say?&quot;
Alielle studied the huge array of military data before her. &quot;I would 
suggest...
two divisions?&quot;
&quot;Sounds fine to me. Rune, what do you think?&quot;
Rune looked up from her book. She was sat in the corner, and largely 
oblivious
to the events around her.
&quot;Fine. Whatever you think.&quot;
&quot;We&#39;ll need to figure out where we can spare troops from,&quot; Alielle 
commented.
&quot;The northern border?&quot;
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Fatora nodded. &quot;That&#39;s relatively low priority. Rune?&quot;
&quot;Hmm? What?&quot;
&quot;Rune?&quot; Fatora frowned. &quot;Are you paying attention?&quot;
Rune stood up and headed for the door. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re capable of doing 
this by
yourself.&quot;
&quot;What? Hey, Rune, wait!&quot; Fatora called, following her sister. &quot;What&#39;s the
matter? Aw... Alielle, you take over.&quot;
Fatora quickly left the war room in pursuit of Rune.

&quot;Mr Jinnai...&quot;
&quot;Shit!&quot; Jinnai leapt back. Nahato had just appeared in front of him. &quot;Will 
you
please stop doing that?&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m very sorry to hear about Diva,&quot; Nahato said. &quot;A tragic loss.&quot;
&quot;She&#39;s not dead yet. And just how did you find out anyway?&quot;
Nahato smiled. &quot;Oh, keeping tabs on you is very difficult, Mr Jinnai. I 
mean,
it&#39;s not as if we can just make ourselves invisible.&quot;
&quot;Very funny,&quot; Jinnai snorted. Even though he knew it was going on, he still
didn&#39;t like the idea of the Phantom Tribe spying on him.
&quot;Congratulations on Dorusland, by the way,&quot; said Nahato. &quot;Of course, to keep 
it
under control, you&#39;ll need a sizeable occupation force. We can help with 
that.&quot;
&quot;How?&quot;
&quot;You&#39;ll see. Where is the Dorusian king?
Jinnai seemed surprised that Nahato would even care. &quot;In a prison somewhere, 
I
guess. I haven&#39;t got around to killing him yet.&quot;
&quot;You can&#39;t!&quot; Nahato&#39;s tone was suddenly quite urgent.
&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; Jinnai was mildly amused. &quot;And since when did you become a
humanitarian?&quot;
&quot;Fran could be very useful if you wish to keep Dorusland under control.&quot;
&quot;But he won&#39;t help us,&quot; Jinnai replied. &quot;We just took over his country, I 
think
that might have soured relations a little.&quot;
&quot;Fran will help,&quot; Nahato said quietly. &quot;Because he&#39;s a coward. And an 
idiot.&quot;

Shayla glanced nervously at Mika, who sat happily next to her at the table.
&quot;She won&#39;t bite, you know,&quot; Nanami smiled.
&quot;I know, it&#39;s just... I&#39;m not good with kids,&quot; Shayla said. &quot;They always 
seem to
start crying whenever I get near them.&quot;
&quot;Come on, Shayla. She seems perfectly content.&quot;
&quot;Oh yeah? The minute her parents walk through that door, I swear she&#39;ll 
start
crying just to show me up.&quot;
Three more people entered the restaurant. Nanami looked around for 
assistance,
and could see very little of it.
&quot;More customers,&quot; she said. &quot;Id better go and see to them.&quot;
&quot;Don&#39;t you have staff to do that kind of thing?&quot; Shayla asked.
Nanami sighed. &quot;Well, technically, yeah. But... she gestured towards a table 
at
the far end of the restaurant, where Parnasse and Mycea sat in blissful
isolation from the rest of the world.
&quot;I&#39;m really starting to miss Mari,&quot; Nanami said.
&quot;That freaky death girl? I thought you said she scared away half your
customers.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, but at least she served the other half.&quot;
&quot;You could always ask her to come back,&quot; Shayla suggested.
Nanami shook her head. &quot;She didn&#39;t like it here. This place just made her
uncomfortable... I don&#39;t know why. She&#39;s much happier with Fatora and 
Alielle.&quot;
Mycea looked over at Shayla and Mika. &quot;Look at that cute kid,&quot; she said. &quot;I 
love
kids, don&#39;t you?&quot;
&quot;They&#39;re okay...&quot; Parnasse replied, wondering if this was a trick question.
&quot;Parnasse, wouldn&#39;t you like to have kids someday?&quot;
Uh oh. He&#39;d fallen into her trap.
&quot;Well... um... I hadn&#39;t really thought about it,&quot; he said nervously. &quot;I 
suppose,
in principle...&quot;
That was enough for Mycea. &quot;Oh, Parny! That&#39;s wonderful!&quot;
Oh, God. What had he done?
The Fujisawas walked into the restaurant.
&quot;Shayla,&quot; Miz called. &quot;Thank you for looking after Mika.&quot;
&quot;Hey, she was no trouble,&quot; Shayla smiled.
&quot;Oh, Mika,&quot; Miz said to her daughter. &quot;Did you enjoy being with Auntie 
Shayla?&quot;
&quot;Mm-hmm!&quot; Mika replied. &quot;I wanna be a priestess!&quot;
Miz was suddenly delighted. &quot;Really? Like I used to be?&quot;
&quot;No. Like Auntie Shayla! I wanna be a fire priestess!&quot;
&quot;F... fire priestess?&quot; Miz echoed, horrified. &quot;Shayla, what have you done to
her?&quot;

Fatora hurried along the corridor, trying to put her many problems into 
order of
priority. She was interrupted in her thoughts by a familiar face.
&quot;Oh, Mari, hi.&quot;
&quot;Hey, princess,&quot; Mari greeted. &quot;Wow, you look stressed.&quot;
&quot;Ugh, don&#39;t even ask,&quot; Fatora moaned. &quot;Stupid life.&quot;
Mari smiled. &quot;You need to unwind. Hey, I&#39;m not busy tonight. Wanna... I 
don&#39;t
know, do something?&quot;
&quot;Can&#39;t,&quot; Fatora sighed. &quot;Sorry. I&#39;m too busy.&quot;
&quot;Well, what about tomorrow night?&quot;
Ftaora shook her head. &quot;Things are awkward right now. We&#39;ll do something 
soon.
Now, I really have to get back to Alielle.&quot;
&quot;Fine,&quot; Mari said bitterly. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll be waiting.&quot;
Fatora didn&#39;t have time for this. &quot;Mari, what&#39;s up with you today?&quot;
&quot;Nothing. Don&#39;t worry about me. Go on, go back to the people you care 
about.&quot;
If Fatora hadn&#39;t been so tired, she would have lost it completely. 
Fortunately
her lack of energy facilitated a more measured response. Relatively 
speaking.
&quot;Listen, Mari. I have got enough to deal with right now. My sister is acting
weird, and I&#39;ve got a pregnant wife whose family is missing. Oh, and I also 
have
to prevent an army of giant insects from invading the country. So I&#39;m afraid
you&#39;ll just have to amuse yourself for a while, okay?&quot;
Mari turned away. &quot;I don&#39;t mind. I&#39;m used to it. Everyone always abandons me 
in
the end.&quot;
She walked away. Fatora didn&#39;t see any point in trying to stop her.

Amiri pressed the button on her intercom. She was secretly rather proud of
having introduced this innovation to Florestica.
&quot;Send in the next patient, please,&quot; she said.
A few moments later, her door opened to reveal Makoto, with a bundle of 
notes
under one arm.
&quot;Oh, Mr Mizuhara,&quot; she said, surprised. &quot;Are you sick?&quot;
&quot;No, no. I&#39;m not. I&#39;m sorry for barging in like this, but I need to talk to 
you
about this research. You do know what it&#39;s about, don&#39;t you?&quot;
&quot;That depends,&quot; Amiri said cautiously. &quot;Do you?&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a model to explain Phantom Tribe abilities. I think.&quot;
&quot;Correct,&quot; Amiri said quietly. &quot;This information is sensitive, that&#39;s why I
couldn&#39;t tell you what it was directly.&quot;
Makoto placed the papers on the table and sat down. &quot;Did you write all of 
this?&quot;
&quot;Goodness me, no,&quot; Amiri replied. &quot;I&#39;m not a physicist. My husband wrote 
it.&quot;
&quot;Husband? I had no idea you were married.&quot;
Amiri sighed. &quot;I was. Back when I was still with the Phantom Tribe. He was a
genius, much the same as you, Makoto. For years, he conducted research into 
how
the Phantom Tribe created illusions.&quot;
&quot;What happened to him?&quot;
&quot;The Phantom Tribe leadership were nervous about the direction of his work. 
They
didn&#39;t like the idea of an Opaque probing too deeply into their sacred 
powers. A
short time later, he ended up dead.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Makoto said.
Amiri shrugged. &quot;It was five years ago. I&#39;ve had a long time to get over it. 
And
at least I have something to remember him by.&quot; She tapped on the pile of 
notes.
&quot;The Phantom Tribe thought they&#39;d destroyed all of his notes. Fortunately, 
he
made copies of everything.&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; said Makoto. &quot;What do you want me to do with this?&quot;
&quot;I want you to use it to stop the Phantom Tribe. They&#39;ve already tried to 
kill
Princess Rune. In all likelihood they&#39;re responsible for sabotaging the 
Stairway
to the Sky. They&#39;re a threat to Roshtaria. I do consider myself to be a
Roshtarian now.&quot;
&quot;And that&#39;s why you&#39;re giving me this?&quot;
Amiri stood up and began to circle her chair. &quot;It&#39;s not just that. You know 
how
it is here, Makoto. For as long as the Phantom Tribe are perceived as a 
threat,
I don&#39;t think people like me will ever be completely safe in this country.&quot; 
She
sat back down. &quot;So, do you think you can do something with it?&quot;
&quot;I really wouldn&#39;t like to say,&quot; Makoto said. I&#39;d need to do more
experimentation. Ideally on a member of the Phantom Tribe, but I doubt that
would be possible...&quot;
&quot;There are already some people who can see through the illusions,&quot; Amiri 
pointed
out. &quot;Most Opaques, at least. Plus Nanami, and also Ifurita, I believe...&quot;
Makoto nodded. &quot;Nanami got the power when she came here. Ifurita has so many
sensors that it&#39;s difficult to fool her. No, the trouble is that I never
imagined Phantom Tribe abilities would work like this. I always assumed that 
it
was don to some sort of telepathy. But it&#39;s more complicated than that. They
seem to bend space to distort the real image, then redistribute photons to
create a false one. It&#39;s all done using micro-energetic charges that 
originate
in the brain...&quot; He trailed off as he realised something. &quot;Hey... come to 
think
of it, I know somebody who can produce micro-energetic charges...&quot;

Ifurita sat on the grass outside the house. Beside her was her twin, the 
quiet
and solemn Three.
&quot;You know,&quot; Ifurita said, &quot;considering you live with us, we don&#39;t get to see
very much of you.&quot;
&quot;I prefer to spend my time alone,&quot; Three replied. &quot;I do not mean to offend 
you.
It is simply the way I am.&quot;
&quot;Well, you needn&#39;t be shy around us,&quot; Ifurita assured. &quot;I know that 
sometimes
Nanami feels as if she&#39;s intruding. I don&#39;t want you to feel like that.&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t,&quot; Three replied. &quot;Ifurita, this is... difficult for me.&quot;
Ifurita moved closer. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;
&quot;Seeing what you and Makoto have now reminds me of what I no longer have. I
loved Yuba... and now I face an infinity without him.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Ifurita said. It was the only thing she could say.
&quot;I would like to be alone now.&quot;
&quot;Of course.&quot; Ifurita stood up. &quot;I&#39;ll be inside if you need me.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, your holiness. You may proceed.&quot;
Afura nodded to the border guard and restarted the engine. She had now left
Roshtaria, and was entering the smallest independent state in El-Hazard. So
small, in fact, that in reality it was nothing more than a medium-sized
conurbation. But not just any conurbation. This was the Holy City.
The most heavily fortified country in El-Hazard, with the lowest population- 
the
Holy City was a curiosity in many regards. It was the only El-Hazard state 
not
to be ruled over by a monarchy: the ultimate power here was wielded by the
elected Alpha Priestess.
Nearly every building was an architectural wonder of one kind or another. As
Afura&#39;s transport glided amid the ancient spires, the priestess found it
difficult not to be awe-struck by the sheer scale of it all. This, despite 
the
facts that she had been here many times before, and really wasn&#39;t in the 
mood
for sightseeing.
The transport headed on towards the precise centre of it all- the huge, 
palatial
building that was the epicentre of El-Hazard theology, and the permanent
residence of the Alpha Priestess.

Day 195

Fujisawa had never been in the offices of a newspaper before. Now that he 
was
here, he found it to be everything he&#39;d imagined... only much less 
interesting.
So, this was the Roshtarian Observer.
A smiling woman emerged from one of the separate offices to greet him.
&quot;Mr Fujisawa, hi. I&#39;m Kagsi Vulpix, assistant editor. And royal 
correspondent.
Do you know Princess Fatora?
&quot;We&#39;re... acquainted.&quot;
&quot;God, I love that woman. Practically writes the news for us. Now, have you 
been
shown around?&quot;
&quot;Um... no. But I was just looking. It&#39;s all very interesting,&quot; Fujisawa 
lied.
Kagsi pointed to a small part of the vast main office. &quot;That&#39;s the editorial
section.&quot; She then pointed to an even smaller corner. &quot;That&#39;s the reporting
section.&quot;
&quot;What&#39;s the rest of it?&quot; Fujisawa asked, gesturing to the main bulk of the
office space.
&quot;Advertising.&quot; She began to embark on an irregular path across the office 
floor,
checking on people&#39;s work as she went. Fujisawa followed.
&quot;Look, I wanted to ask about writing an article,&quot; he said.
She nodded. &quot;Oh, yes. I remember. About the Opaques. Very topical, very 
cutting
edge.&quot;
&quot;I just felt that somebody ought to speak up in their favour,&quot; Fujisawa 
said.
Kagsi nodded. &quot;I agree. And a big name like you... it shouldn&#39; be a problem. 
You
should be aware, though... your viewpoint isn&#39;t a popular one. There&#39;ll be
critics. And newspaper people can be bastards.&quot;
Several reporters looked up from their work.
&quot;What?&quot; she said defensively. &quot;You ARE bastards.&quot; Turning back to Fujisawa, 
she
continued. &quot;I just want you to understand the risks. Some of our competitors
might want to discredit you after this.&quot;
&quot;I understand,&quot; Fujisawa replied.
&quot;You don&#39;t have any embarrassing secrets that they could drag up? 
Addictions,
that sort of thing?&quot;
He shook his head with certainty. &quot;Oh, no. I&#39;m a professional.&quot;

Summer had given way to autumn, and the usually pleasant weather was now
punctuated by the odd downpour.
Parnasse and Mycea sat watching the rain through the restaurant window. 
Suddenly
a figure streaked past, and moments later entered the restaurant.
&quot;Damn, damn, damn,&quot; the Opaque girl cursed quietly, completely soaked from 
the
rain. She looked at Parnasse and Mycea. &quot;I&#39;m here for the job interview.&quot;
&quot;Through there.&quot; Parnasse pointed towards the back room. &quot;She&#39;s not busy, 
you
can go straight in.&quot;
&quot;Thanks,&quot; the girl smiled, and headed for the far side of the restaurant.
Parnasse looked puzzled. &quot;I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve seen her before...&quot;
&quot;Really?&quot; Mycea replied. &quot;I didn&#39;t know you knew any blues.&quot;
A tiny alarm bell went off in Parnasse&#39;s head. &#39;Blue&#39; was a term commonly 
used
to describe Opaques, but was generally considered to be derogatory. Having 
said
that, a lot of people just used it out of ignorance rather than malice. He
decided to let it pass, and continue with the conversation.
&quot;I don&#39;t really,&quot; he said. &quot;I just think I recognise her from somewhere.&quot;
&quot;I hope she doesn&#39;t get the job,&quot; Mycea said.
&quot;How come?&quot;
She stared at Parnasse as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. 
&quot;She&#39;s
a blue. They&#39;re creepy.&quot;
&quot;Creepy? How?&quot;
&quot;Well, duh. They&#39;re Phantom Tribe. Five years ago they were trying to kill 
us.
Then they give themselves another name and we invite them into the country. 
My
dad says they&#39;re spies.&quot;
Parnasse felt that he should, at least, try to object. &quot;That&#39;s ridiculous.&quot;
&quot;No, it&#39;s not. He read it in the news.&quot;
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Parnasse sighed. Another illusion shattered. The perfect Mycea was 
not
so perfect after all.

Nanami looked up at the applicant. &quot;Hi. Please, sit down.&quot;
&quot;Thanks,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Sorry, I&#39;m dripping all over your floor. The rain 
is...&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Nanami replied. &quot;Now, you&#39;re here for the part-time position,
right?&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m a student, so I could do with some more 
money.&quot;
Nanami looked down at her list. &quot;Right... what&#39;s your name again?&quot;
&quot;Tenax,&quot; the girl replied.

Jinnai walked down the corridor of the Dorusian prison. Sakura followed him,
swinging her Power Key Unit around as she went.
&quot;Will you stop that? It keeps hitting me in the back.&quot;
&quot;Sorry.&quot;
They reached the cell. Jinnai peered through the bars at the king of 
Dorusland.
&quot;Katsuhiko Jinnai,&quot; Fran said. &quot;You don&#39;t scare me.&quot;
&quot;Don&#39;t I?&quot; Jinnai sneered. &quot;Oh well. Sakura, kill him.&quot;
&quot;Eek!&quot; Fran leapt back. Sakura pointed her Power Key Unit towards him.
&quot;Go on,&quot; Jinnai prompted.
&quot;Wait, wait!&quot; Fran stalled desperately. &quot;Please, you... you don&#39;t have to 
kill
me! I could be of use to you!&quot;
Jinnai frowned. &quot;Oh? How, exactly?&quot;
&quot;Well...&quot; Fran hadn&#39;t thought this far ahead. &quot;Um... just hold on a minute, 
I&#39;ll
think of something...&quot;
&quot;Of course,&quot; Jinnai began, &quot;there is the problem of how to calm the Dorusian
people...&quot;
&quot;I could do that!&quot; Fran cut in. &quot;Yes! The people respect me! They&#39;d listen 
to
me!&quot;
&quot;Really?&quot; Jinnai said, feigning surprise. &quot;Well, maybe I shouldn&#39;t kill you
after all. Perhaps we could even restore you to your position as king...&quot;
Fran looked hopeful. &quot;You&#39;d do that?&quot;
&quot;Maybe. You&#39;d have to play by our rules, of course...&quot;
&quot;Of course. I&#39;d do that!&quot; Fran replied.
Jinnai smiled. &quot;Well, it looks like we&#39;re all going to benefit from this 
idea of
mine. I&#39;m glad I thought of it.&quot;
Sakura looked confused. &quot;But you said it was Nahato who...&quot;
He elbowed Sakura in the ribs. &quot;Shut up.&quot;

Three had been watching the girl for a few minutes now. She was sitting 
outside
on the grass, in the middle of a rainstorm. How strange.

Mari was surprised to see somebody join her.
&quot;It is inadvisable for you to remain out here,&quot; the visitor said. &quot;You are
human. Your body is not designed to withstand such prolonged exposure to
climatic extremes.&quot;
Mari looked up. &quot;Ifurita?&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; she replied. &quot;I am Three.&quot;
&quot;Oh.&quot;
Three sat down next to Mari. &quot;Something is troubling you.&quot;
Mari sighed. &quot;In this whole world, I only have two friends. And I think I&#39;ve
just lost them. I freaked at Fatora... she just doesn&#39;t seem to have time 
for me
anymore. She spends all of her spare time with Alielle. So, I&#39;ve come to the
disturbing conclusion that I&#39;m jealous of Alielle.&quot;
&quot;Why is that disturbing?&quot; Three asked.
&quot;I&#39;m jealous of her wife! The woman she loves most in the whole world. I 
suck!&quot;
Three considered this. &quot;Do you love Fatora?&quot;
Mari seemed surprised by the question. &quot;Love? No, no... I just like her.&quot;
&quot;Then is it possible that you are jealous not of Alielle, but of the 
closeness
Alielle and Fatora share?&quot; Three asked. &quot;I find myself envious of the love
between Ifurita and Makoto. Is that it? Do you simply wish to be loved?&quot;
Mari stayed silent for a long time.
&quot;Back on Earth... there was somebody that I loved. She didn&#39;t know. It was
strange. Just being in the same room as her made me happy, but at the same
time... it hurt me, because I knew she&#39;d never feel for me what I felt for 
her.
There wasn&#39;t any point in telling her. She&#39;d only have rejected me. It would
have just meant more misery.&quot;
&quot;The man I love is dead,&quot; Three replied. &quot;It is extremely painful to live
without somebody you have loved. But I do not regret loving him.&quot; She turned 
to
Mari. &quot;Do not give up, Mari Kurai. It seems to me that you possess many
desirable qualities. I believe you will one day find someone willing to love
you.&quot;
Footsteps on the wet grass behind them signalled the end of the 
conversation.
Mari looked over her shoulder. It was Ifurita.
&quot;Mari? What are you doing out here in the rain?&quot;
&quot;Sitting. Talking.&quot;
Ifurita frowned. &quot;In this weather? You&#39;re not designed to withstand...&quot;
&quot;I know,&quot; Mari interrupted.
&quot;Well...&quot; Ifurita continued. &quot;You&#39;d better come in. Makoto wants to see 
you.&quot;
Mari stood up, wondering why on Earth Makoto would want to see her of all
people.
&quot;Three...&quot; Ifurita began.
There was no response.
&quot;Never mind,&quot; Ifurita sighed. She led Mari back to the house, leaving Three
sitting in the rain.

&quot;I think I may have met her,&quot; Amiri said. &quot;Mari Kurai... didn&#39;t she work in 
the
Shinonome Diner for a while?&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s her,&quot; Makoto replied. &quot;I should warn you, though... she &#39;s a little 
bit
unusual. She can be tricky to work with.&quot;
&quot;In what way?&quot;
Makoto tried to think of a way of putting it politely. &quot;Well, she doesn&#39;t 
really
like... anybody.&quot;
&quot;So she&#39;s antisocial?&quot; Amiri asked.
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t go as far as antisocial,&quot; Makoto said. &quot;She&#39;s more... well, is 
there
such a word as asocial?&quot;
Ifurita entered the room, followed by the thoroughly wet Mari.
&quot;Here she is,&quot; Ifurita said.
&quot;Hi, Mari,&quot; Makoto said, trying to appear friendly. Mari saw right through 
it.
&quot;What do you want?&quot;
&quot;We were hoping you could help us with some research,&quot; Amiri replied.
Mari frowned suspiciously. &quot;How?&quot;
&quot;Well,&quot; said Makoto, &quot;we want to perform some experiments on you.&quot;

There weren&#39;t many people Parnasse trusted in this sort of situation. 
Usually he
would, albeit grudgingly, ask his sister for advice. But this was different.
This was a relationship problem, and the last thing he wanted was to admit 
to
Alielle that she knew more about this sort of thing than he did.
&quot;Lady Qawoor,&quot; I&#39;d like to ask for your advice on something.&quot;
Qawoor looked up. &quot;Of course, Parnasse.&quot;
&quot;Well, it&#39;s my girlfriend. You see, I really like her, and she really likes 
me.
But... the thing is... earlier today she made some comments about the 
Opaques.
She doesn&#39;t like them... she keeps repeating this stuff her dad told her 
about
how they&#39;re all spies. It&#39;s insane, but...&quot;
&quot;You don&#39;t feel that you can confront her about it?&quot; Qawoor guessed.
Parnasse nodded. Ordinarily, I&#39;d be furious at someone who said stuff like 
that.
But Mycea&#39;s been so good to me, so supportive... it just seems ungrateful,
that&#39;s all.&quot;
Qawoor thought for a moment.
&quot;This isn&#39;t unusual, Parnasse. A lot of people have the same views, because
that&#39;s the sort of society we live in right now. They&#39;re not necessarily bad
people, but people who grow up in a racist environment often become racist
themselves.&quot;
&quot;So you&#39;re saying it might not be her fault?&quot;
&quot;Perhaps not. It sounds to me like she&#39;s just been misinformed. There&#39;s 
every
possibility that she&#39;ll change her views if she realises they&#39;re flawed.&quot;
&quot;I see,&quot; Parnasse replied. He could do it, he thought to himself. He could
change her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, your holiness, but the Alpha Priestess is busy today.&quot;
&quot;Well? What about tomorrow?&quot; Afura sighed impatienty.
&quot;She is also indisposed tomorrow,&quot; the aide replied.
Afura kept going. &quot;The day after, then?&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m afraid her eminence does not take appointments that far in advance.&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; Afura groaned. &quot;Of course she doesn&#39;t.&quot;
She walked away angrily. She was a chief priestess! Just what was the Alpha
Priestess so engrossed in that it meant she couldn&#39;t talk to one of her most
senior subordinates?
&quot;You won&#39;t get anywhere, you know. Not like that.&quot;
Afura jumped at the familiar voice. Jennown Doht stood before her, smiling.
&quot;The Alpha Priestess is tied up with a massive theological conundrum. She&#39;ll
only respond to the most urgent requests.&quot;
&quot;What theological conundrum?&quot; Afura frowned. &quot;I haven&#39;t heard anything about
this.&quot;
&quot;No, well, it&#39;s highly classified. We can&#39;t tell just anybody.&quot;
&quot;By just anybody, I assume you mean me,&quot; Afura replied icily. &quot;You, on the 
other
hand, seem to have been let in on this secret. I&#39;ve been away from the Holy 
City
for a while, but I didn&#39;t realise that consultants now outrank chief
priestesses.&quot;
&quot;Oh, I&#39;d like to tell you about it, Priestess Mann,&quot; Doht said, with as much
sincerity as he could manage. &quot;But first, you&#39;d have to prove that you 
were...
trustworthy.&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t know what you mean,&quot; Afura replied. Of course, she knew exactly 
what
Doht meant, but she wasn&#39;t about to hand over the prophecy to him if there 
was
another way around this.
&quot;I&#39;ll give you some time to think about it,&quot; Doht smiled. &quot;in the 
meantime...
good luck trying to get that appointment.&quot;

Day 203

Alielle turned off the shower, and felt blindly for the towel.
&quot;Here you go.&quot;
She grabbed the towel being held in her direction and quickly dried her 
face.
She opened her eyes to see Fatora in front of her.
&quot;Thanks, Fatora,&quot; she said.
&quot;Are you feeling better now?&quot; Fatora asked.
&quot;A little,&quot; Alielle said as she dried herself off. &quot;I keep telling myself my
family are probably fine... I just wish I knew for certain.&quot;
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll find out...&quot; Fatora said, suddenly distracted for some
reason. She peered down at Alielle&#39;s stomach.
Alielle couldn&#39;t help but smile. &quot;What? What are you looking at?&quot;
&quot;Stand sideways.&quot;
Alielle did as she was asked. &quot;Okay, now what is it?&quot;
&quot;You have a bump.&quot;
It took Alielle a few seconds to work out what Fatora was talking about.
&quot;Surely not... I&#39;d have noticed.&quot;
&quot;You do! I can see it!&quot;
&quot;Aw...&quot; Alielle sighed. &quot;Now I&#39;ll have to start wearing maternity clothes.
They&#39;re so unflattering.&quot;
&quot;Hey,&quot; Fatora smiled. &quot;I thought you&#39;d be pleased.&quot;
&quot;Oh, I am,&quot; Alielle assured her. &quot;This is wonderful.&quot;
&quot;I just makes it all seem more real somehow,&quot; Fatora mused.
Alielle embraced Fatora. &quot;Aw. That&#39;s so sweet.&quot;
&quot;So,&quot; Fatora said. &quot;Have you thought of any names yet?&quot;
&quot;I can&#39;t think of any I like. What about you?&quot; Alielle prompted.
&quot;Well, apparently &#39;Fatora&#39; is an increasingly popular name these days.&quot;
&quot;I should have seen this coming,&quot; Alielle smiled to herself.
&quot;What?&quot;
&quot;Nothing, nothing...&quot;

&quot;Such an eloquent and well written piece,&quot; Miz boasted. &quot;Don&#39;t you agree,
Shayla?&quot;
&quot;Um, yeah,&quot; Shayla nodded, still only three lines into the article. The
Roshtarian Observer was clearly in agreement with Miz, as they had dedicated 
a
full page to Fujisawa&#39;s piece.
&quot;Come on, Miz,&quot; Fujisawa sighed. &quot;You&#39;re embarrassing me.&quot;
Miz continued. &quot;But it&#39;s so compelling. You display such knowledge of 
cultural
interactions.&quot;
&quot;Well, I just wrote about what I knew. Earth has a long history of people 
hating
each other.&quot;
Nanami walked past on her way to the kitchens. &quot;I noticed a few grammatical
errors.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s impossible!&quot; Miz insisted.
&quot;Oh yeah...&quot; Shayla said. &quot;Look, here&#39;s one.&quot;
&quot;Well, anyway,&quot; Miz replied, trying to change the subject, &quot;it&#39;s not the 
grammar
that&#39;s important. It&#39;s the content.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, I suppose so,&quot; Shayla agreed.
Fujisawa didn&#39;t reply. God, he hoped none of his students picked up on his 
bad
grammar.

Mycea walked into the kitchens, and almost had a heart attack.
&quot;Hi, Mycea,&quot; Nanami said. &quot;This is our new part-time waitress, Tenax. Tenax,
this is my assistant, Mycea.&quot;
Tenax grinned. &quot;Hey. Nice to meet you, Mycea.&quot;
Mycea shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot. &quot;Um, yeah. Hi.&quot;
Tenax took Mycea by the arm. &quot;I just know we&#39;re going to be the best of
friends!&quot;

God, the crowd looked ugly. Fran knew he had to play this very carefully.
&quot;You know,&quot; he said, &quot;the Bugrom really aren&#39;t as bad as they look.&quot;
Damn, Bad choice of words. The people didn&#39;t like that one bit.
&quot;Be assured that during this difficult time for our country, I will be here 
to
lead you.&quot;
Strange. That didn&#39;t seem to cheer them up.
No matter, Fran thought. This next line should convince them.
Whether it would have or not is really a matter for the academics, as the
luckless king never delivered it. At that very moment, the stage collapsed
underneath him.
Jinnai, surrounded by a team of Bugrom, approached the scene quickly.
&quot;What the hell happened to the stage?&quot;
&quot;What does it look like?&quot; Fran answered angrily.
Jinnai noticed a piece of paper lying next to the wrecked stage. He picked 
it p
and studied it.
&quot;Hmm... looks like a note of some sort.&quot;
&quot;What does it say?&quot; Fran asked.
&quot;I don&#39;t know. I can&#39;t read it. It&#39;s in stupid Dorusland writing.&quot;
Fran took the note from Jinnai, and read its contents.

Hello, King Fran.
You are a collaborator.
Lots of love,
The Purple Lightning.

Who the bloody hell was the Purple Lightning?

&quot;So, you came at last,&quot; Doht smiled.
Afura sighed. For over a week, she had tried everything to get an audience 
with
the Alpha Priestess. It hadn&#39;t worked, just as Doht had predicted. Now she 
stood
in the Holy City&#39;s central library, having reluctantly accepted Doht&#39;s
invitation.
&quot;I want to know what&#39;s really going on,&quot; she demanded.
Doht shrugged. &quot;Don&#39;t we all?&quot;
&quot;Don&#39;t play games with me. What&#39;s this problem that you and the Alpha 
Priestess
are investigating?&quot;
&quot;Why do you want to know?&quot;
Afura felt that the answer to that question should have been perfectly 
obvious.
However, there just might be a better way to go about this.
&quot;I want to help,&quot; she said. &quot;And I can help. This is what I&#39;m trained for.&quot;
&quot;Well...&quot; Doht began, &quot;you ARE one of the Holy Order&#39;s top theological 
minds. I
suppose it&#39;s only right to let you in on our secret.&quot;
As Doht led her to the restricted section of the library, Afura wondered why 
he
hadn&#39;t demanded she hand over the prophecy first.
Soon, she would have her answer.
Doht unlocked one of the cabinets and took out a scroll.
&quot;Priestess Mann, when the seminary council approved your mission to uncover 
the
Heretic Prophecy, the Holy Order released some previously banned documents
concerning its true implications. Last month, I came across this.&quot;
Afura looked at the ancient text. &quot;I see...&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s rather long winded. I&#39;ll give you the gist of it. Part of the text
confirms the authenticity of the prophecy. The rest is more... interesting.
Contained within the Heretic Prophecy is what&#39;s referred to as... the
fundamental message.&quot;
&quot;The what?&quot;
&quot;A message from God. Some sort of... statement about human life. The most
important message in the universe!&quot;
Afura kept on reading. &quot;That&#39;s... what it says.&quot;
&quot;Which is why we&#39;re so desperate to have the full text of the Heretic 
Prophecy.
We need to find that message, priestess!&quot;
Afura paused. Things were suddenly different. Previously, she&#39;d thought 
nothing
could convince her to give Doht the Prophecy. The Alpha Priestess, yes; but 
not
Doht. But now... this was the ultimate theological challenge. She had waited 
her
whole life for something like this.
&quot;Very well. I&#39;ll give you the prophecy. On he condition that you don&#39;t 
release
it to he public.&quot;
Doht laughed. &quot;Do you really think I&#39;d release something of such a sensitive
nature?&quot;
Afura raised an eyebrow. &quot;I suppose not.&quot;
&quot;Come, Priestess Mann,&quot; he smiled. &quot;God&#39;s message awaits us. And together, 
we
will find it.&quot;
