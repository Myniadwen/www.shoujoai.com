EL-HAZARD: THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME

The Shape of Things So Far-

Ifurita discovers that Qawoor is a descendent of her creator. The Bugrom
gain control of Dorusland, then install Fran as a puppet monarch. Fatora
and Alielle take charge of Roshtaria&#39;s defences to relieve the burden on
Rune, but Rune does not take this well. Afura travels to the Holy City to
investigate the new Alpha Priestess, and discovers a mysterious
conspiracy of silence. Makoto and Amiri start to research the Phantom
Tribe&#39;s powers. Fujisawa writes a newspaper article pleading for
sympathy towards the Opaques. Parnasse is concerned when Mycea
reveals herself to be racist. Mari feels rejected when Fatora can no
longer spend time with her. Tenax begins work at Nanami&#39;s restaurant.
A speech by Fran is sabotaged by someone calling themselves the Purple
Lightning. Doht shows Afura proof that the Heretic Prophecy contains a
hidden message from God. Reluctantly, she agrees to give him the full
text.

THE EIGHTH MONTH: ANTIMATTER BLACK

Many years ago in El-Hazard, there was a man who designed weapons.
He was very good at it; so good, in fact, that he regarded himself as one
of the greatest geniuses in history.
Suffice it to say, he was not the most psychologically stable person in
the world.
Each weapon he produced was more perfect than the last. As the years
went by, he became ever more proficient in the art of mass destruction.
Until one day, he created a weapon so potent, so unstable, that it killed
him.
Or so the story goes. In actual fact, the weapon transformed him. No
longer existing in a physical sense, he was suddenly the genius he
dreamed of being. He saw all, he knew all. He was a God.
And that was when his mental problems really began.

Day 217

&quot;Incredible. Refusing to speak with a Muldoon priestess? That&#39;s
unprecedented!&quot; Miz exclaimed.
Afura nodded. &quot;Personally, I think Doht is having too much of an
influence on the Alpha Priestess. He doesn&#39;t like the Muldoon
priesthood. He&#39;s said as much.&quot;
Miz looked concerned. &quot;Did you see Doht while you were in the Holy
City?&quot;
&quot;Just... briefly,&quot; Afura lied.
&quot;Be very careful of that man,&quot; Miz warned. &quot;He&#39;s dangerous. When
people like him get promoted, the power goes to their heads.&quot;
Afura tried to change the subject. &quot;Well, I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s
something untoward going on in the Holy City. I&#39;m hoping to return
there soon.&quot;
Afura hated keeping secrets from Miz. She wanted desperately to tell her
about the message from God. But that would mean telling her that Doht
now had the prophecy. She couldn&#39;t justify handing it over after
promising she wouldn&#39;t. Not yet. But soon, when they found that
message... she would have all the justification she needed.
&quot;Watch out, here I come!&quot;
The Shinonome Diner&#39;s newest waitress dodged in between the
customers with three precariously balanced trays. Mycea observed
Tenax&#39;s actions closely.
&quot;God, I hate her.&quot;
&quot;But why?&quot; Parnasse asked wearily. He was all too aware of his
girlfriend&#39;s disdain for Opaques, but Tenax had presented no reason for
Mycea to dislike her. &quot;All she&#39;s done since she started here is be nice to
you.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s the problem. She&#39;s too nice.&quot;
&quot;Too nice?&quot;
Mycea nodded. &quot;Yes. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s suspicious?&quot;
&quot;No, I don&#39;t. Did it ever occur to you that maybe she&#39;s just a nice
person?&quot;
&quot;Oh, come on, Parnasse. You are so naive. She&#39;s obviously up to
something.&quot;
&quot;Ssh!&quot; Parnasse urged. &quot;She&#39;s coming!&quot;
Tenax approached Mycea. &quot;Hey,&quot; she smiled. &quot;I got a tip. Here you go.&quot;
She pressed some coins into Mycea&#39;s palm.
&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; Mycea asked.
&quot;Half the tip. It&#39;s only fair, since you do half the work. Well, I&#39;ll go and
see if Nanami needs a hand in the kitchens.&quot;
She walked away. Mycea was furious.
&quot;Did you see that? Did you see what she just did?&quot;
&quot;Yep,&quot; Parnasse replied. &quot;She gave you some money.&quot;
Mycea growled. &quot;This means that every time I get a tip, I&#39;ll have to
share it with her! You know why she&#39;s done this? She knows I get more
tips than she does, because I&#39;m not a...&quot;
&quot;Don&#39;t say it!&quot;
Mycea looked disappointedly at Parnasse. &quot;Lighten up. It&#39;s only a
word.&quot;
She shrugged and walked off. Parnasse was joined by Nanami.
&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;
&quot;Oh! Nothing!&quot; Parnasse assured her.
&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Nanami replied. &quot;Hey, it&#39;s Alielle&quot;!
&quot;Huh?&quot; Parnasse looked to the doorway and saw that his sister had just
entered.
&quot;There&#39;s something about her that looks different,&quot; Nanami mused.
&quot;Hey, Alielle! Did you change your hair or something?&quot;
Parnasse knew immediately what was different. &quot;Alielle!&quot; he hissed.
&quot;You&#39;ve forgotten to...&quot;
&quot;I know!&quot; Nanami exclaimed. &quot;You&#39;re not wearing your thingy. What
do you call it? That diamond thing on your forehead...&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s called a dhar,&quot; Parnasse replied. &quot;All Dorusians wear it. Alielle,
where&#39;s yours?&quot; He was visibly agitated, as if Alielle had committed
some grave social transgression.
&quot;I&#39;m making a political statement,&quot; Alielle said calmly. &quot;A lot of
Dorusians in Roshtaria are doing the same. It&#39;s a protest against the
Dorusian government.&quot;
Parnasse looked confused. &quot;Why?&quot;
Alielle sighed. &quot;Haven&#39;t you been reading the papers, Parnasse? Our
country&#39;s government is collaborating with the Bugrom. They&#39;ve got
Fran on their side. That&#39;s why they&#39;re not wearing the dhars.&quot;
Parnasse shook his head. &quot;Mother would kill you.&quot;
&quot;Mother would be proud that I&#39;m expressing solidarity with our
oppressed population,&quot; Alielle replied.
Nanami blinked. Alielle&#39;s transformation into a politician had been
remarkably rapid. There were times when she sounded exactly like
Rune, and others when she sounded (perhaps more disturbingly) just like
Fatora.
&quot;Hey,&quot; Nanami said, &quot;have either of you heard the rumours about the
Purple Lightning?&quot;
Alielle nodded. &quot;Yes. There have been a lot of sightings, mainly in
Dorusland&#39;s capital. But they all contradict each other. Some people are
certain it&#39;s a man, and other people swear it&#39;s a woman.&quot;
&quot;Who is it, some kind of resistance fighter?&quot; Parnasse asked.
&quot;Sort of,&quot; Alielle said. &quot;But they never actually attack the Bugrom. They
just... undermine them. Make them look stupid.&quot;
&quot;An asexual, non-violent resistance fighter?&quot; Nanami pondered. &quot;Only
in El-Hazard...&quot;

&quot;What can you sense?&quot; Amiri asked.
Mari concentrated. &quot;Your immune system is active against a minor viral
infection. Your left arm was recently broken, and has healed. Hmm...
you have a paper cut on your right hand. Do you want me to heal that?&quot;
Amiri looked to Makoto and Ifurita, who were standing in the midst of
an array of scanning equipment.
&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Makoto nodded.
&quot;I&#39;m done,&quot; Mari said, little more than a second later.
&quot;What?&quot; Makoto replied. &quot;That was too quick, I didn&#39;t get anything!
Ifurita, did you pick anything up?&quot;
&quot;There was a brief stream of energy from Mari into the doctor. Like all
the other tests, it only flowed in one direction.&quot;
Makoto shook his head. &quot;And we still have no way of disrupting the
energy flow. Okay, we&#39;ll try it again, on me this time. Mari, I don&#39;t want
you to start healing straight away, alright?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Mari sighed. She placed her hand on Makoto&#39;s shoulder
and set about detecting his ailments.
&quot;Okay, I&#39;m detecting... a headache, probably stress related. And you
have a mysterious dull ache in your left testicle.&quot;
Ifurita giggled.
&quot;Hey!&quot; Makoto objected. &quot;It&#39; not funny! I... what the hell?&quot;
For a few moments, he and Mari remained motionless. Then he jumped
back.
&quot;I think... something weird just happened,&quot; he said. &quot;Mari, are you
okay?&quot;
Mari suddenly started smiling- a distant, vacant smile.
&quot;Heh,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;I said testicle. I suppose that was pretty
funny...&quot;
She walked unsteadily over to Ifurita. &quot;I&#39;m bored. Can we finish now?
Pretty please?&quot; She draped herself over Ifurita, grinning. &quot;You&#39;re cute.&quot;
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with her?&quot; Amiri asked. &quot;If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d
swear she was drunk.&quot;
&quot;Endorphins,&quot; Ifurita replied, trying to discourage Mari from feeling her
breasts. &quot;I&#39;m picking up a massive quantity of endorphins in her brain.
They weren&#39;t there a minute ago.&quot;
&quot;Well, that explains why she&#39;s suddenly so happy,&quot; Amiri said. &quot;But
how did they get there?&quot;
&quot;I think...&quot; Makoto began, &quot;I think I did it.&quot;
Ifurita looked at him, concerned. &quot;What?&quot;
&quot;She was looking inside me... then when you laughed, I was distracted
for a second. Then I realised I could see inside her too. I just hadn&#39;t
known what to look for.&quot;
&quot;What did you see?&quot; Amiri asked.
&quot;She was so... depressed. So angry. For a moment, I thought I should do
something about it. The next thing I knew, this had happened.&quot;
&quot;You stimulated pleasure hormones to relieve her depression,&quot; Amiri
observed. &quot;Makoto, this is an important discovery. The polarity of the
energy flow can be reversed. If it works with Mari, it could work with
the Phantom Tribe. I wonder what would happen if the polarity of their
powers was reversed?&quot;
&quot;We&#39;ll have to feed it into the equations and find out,&quot; Makoto replied.
&quot;Ifurita?&quot;
&quot;Um, yes,&quot; Ifurita said, still distracted by the blissfully happy goth
wrapped around her.
&quot;Come on...&quot; Mari smiled. &quot;I bet you&#39;d like it if you tried it...&quot;
&quot;Really, I must decline. But thank you anyway,&quot; Ifurita said,
embarrassed.
&quot;Please... it&#39;ll just be our secret...&quot;

Jinnai surveyed the map of Dorusland in front of him.
&quot;Excellent,&quot; he smiled. &quot;One of the key nations of the Alliance... and it&#39;s
in Bugrom hands! This is the perfect point to launch an attack on
Roshtaria.&quot;
&quot;Have you no tactical ability at all?&quot; Nahato frowned. &quot;Roshtaria
EXPECTS you to invade. Half the troops in the Alliance are massed
along that border. Leaving other nations vulnerable. Take Styrenia, for
example.&quot;
&quot;Styrenia?&quot; Jinnai studied the nation&#39;s position on the map. &quot;It&#39;s
strategically worthless.&quot;
&quot;But it&#39;s ripe for conquest. It&#39;s a pacifist nation, with only a small army,
most of which is defending other Alliance countries. In its whole history,
it&#39;s never been conquered. Taking it would be a serious blow to the
Alliance&#39;s morale.&quot;
&quot;Styrenia it is,&quot; Jinnai nodded.
&quot;I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll have to fight this battle alone,&quot; Nahato pointed out.
&quot;There&#39;s a significant Opaque population in Styrenia. They&#39;d see
through our illusions. And I&#39;d prefer to keep our involvement in this war
a secret for the time being.&quot;
Diva entered the room. She was visibly pregnant, with what Jinnai
assumed was the new queen. He still didn&#39;t really understand the whole
Bugrom life cycle thing, but asking questions, as he&#39;d found, was
fraught with difficulty.
&quot;Mr Jinnai...&quot; she began.
&quot;Yes?&quot; Jinnai responded.
Diva cast a glance at Nahato, then looked back to Jinnai. She sighed.
&quot;It can wait.&quot;
She left the room as quickly as she&#39;d entered. Jinnai seemed concerned
by her behaviour. Nahato didn&#39;t.
&quot;Where is Sakura?&quot; he asked.
&quot;Sakura?&quot; Jinnai echoed. &quot;She said something about going out for some
fresh air...&quot;

Sakura was feeling strange today. She couldn&#39;t explain it. She just
needed to be out... out of that damn hive, away from everyone.
It felt as if... there was too much of everything.
Too much energy.
She flew higher up, and aimed her Power Key Unit at a random patch of
sky. The target didn&#39;t matter.
She fired. A series of black bubbles shot into the middle distance,
sucking up the energy around them until they collapsed.
It felt good, as if some primal urge within her was being satisfied.
Sakura decided she&#39;d like to do it again.
And again.

Day 228

&quot;Hello? Is anyone there?&quot;
Rune looked up to see the source of the voice. Yes... do come in.&quot;
Alielle entered Rune&#39;s bedroom with caution. &quot;It&#39;s only me. You&#39;ve
been spending a lot of time in here, you know. I haven&#39;t really seen
you...&quot;
&quot;Is there any more news from Styrenia?&quot; Rune asked, changing the
subject with remarkable speed.
&quot;Only confirming what we already know,&quot; Alielle sighed. &quot;The Bugrom
took it in less than a day. They&#39;re trying to set up another puppet
government like the one in Dorusland, but they&#39;re not getting much co-
operation.&quot;
&quot;How strange,&quot; Rune said. &quot;It took the Bugrom weeks to take
Dorusland. This invasion was much quicker. I know Styrenia wasn&#39;t as
well defended, but even so...&quot;
&quot;You know...&quot; Alielle said tentatively, &quot;we could really use your help.&quot;
Rune shook her head. &quot;I&#39;d just be getting in the way.&quot;
&quot;Is that really what you think?&quot;
Rune let out a long sigh. &quot;It&#39;s... deeper than that. I&#39;m sure Fatora&#39;s told
you about the terrible depression she suffered after our father died. I
promised her then that I&#39;d shoulder the responsibility of being a princess.
And since then, that&#39;s how it&#39;s been. I was the one who&#39;d make political
decisions. I was the one who&#39;d give birth to the next generation.&quot;
&quot;That was a lot of responsibility for just one person.&quot;
&quot;No, I didn&#39;t see it like that. I had a clear purpose in life. It defined 
me.
But now... I find that I can never have children, and Fatora can do my
job better than I can. So what is my purpose?&quot;
Alielle smiled. &quot;Fatora&#39;s not as great a politician as you think. She can
be a little heavy handed. If there wasn&#39;t a war on, she&#39;d have alienated
half the Alliance by now. She lacks your diplomatic touch. Besides, she
only started doing this to help you.&quot;
Rune nodded. &quot;I know. I just feel at a loss. I&#39;ve spent my whole life
working on one thing or another, to the degree that I&#39;ve never really had
any free time. Now that I have, I don&#39;t know what to do with it.&quot;
&quot;You don&#39;t have to spend every waking moment working for the good of
the country,&quot; Alielle said. &quot;Fatora seemed to manage just fine with that
concept. Perhaps you should try to be more like her.&quot;
Rune blushed. &quot;But I&#39;ve never... I mean, I don&#39;t share Fatora&#39;s interest
in... um...&quot;
&quot;Not like that,&quot; Alielle laughed. &quot;Well, not straight away... I mean you
should learn to relax, and enjoy the perks of being a princess, like Fatora
does. Order the most famous writers in the country to produce a ten-hour
play about how great you are. Invent a really stupid public holiday.
Name a chain of islands after parts of the female anatomy.&quot;
&quot;But I couldn&#39;t do that...&quot;
&quot;Why not? Nobody&#39;s going to stop you. You&#39;re a princess! I think you
need a lesson in how to be irresponsible...&quot;

Hearing small footsteps, Fujisawa stopped at the door of the staff room
and looked over his shoulder.
Cerev stood expectantly behind him.
&quot;Oh, hi, Cerev,&quot; Fujisawa smiled. &quot;What can I do for you?&quot;
&quot;I liked the article you wrote,&quot; he said.
Fujisawa really shouldn&#39;t have been surprised, but he was.
&quot;You read newspapers? That&#39;s unusual for someone your age.&quot;
&quot;I like the Roshtarian Observer. It&#39;s very balanced. I don&#39;t like the
Roshtarian Sun though.&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; Fujisawa said. &quot;I think we can agree on that point.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s too juvenile,&quot; Cerev continued. He smiled wryly. A child could
read it.&quot;
&quot;So they say,&quot; Fujisawa laughed.
Cerev took a piece of paper from his pocket. &quot;I noticed a few
grammatical mistakes in your piece. I made a note of them.&quot;
&quot;Well, thanks...&quot; Fujisawa took the paper from Cerev. The word
&#39;prodigy&#39; seemed insufficient somehow.
&quot;I won&#39;t tell the other students,&quot; Cerev said. He turned and headed off
down the corridor.
Amazing. Fujisawa walked into the staff room, only to find it empty.
A copy of the Roshtarian Sun lay on a table.
The same sort of morbid curiosity that compels people to sneak a look at
a road accident suddenly took hold of his brain. He knew reading the
Roshtarian Sun would only make him angry. But part of him had to
know... What was Jennown Doht saying today?
Five seconds later, he was searching through the abandoned tabloid for
Doht&#39;s column.

JENNOWN DOHT: THE VOICE OF REASON
&#39;In the past few days we have witnessed the fall of another Alliance
nation to the Bugrom. But why did Styrenia fall so quickly, when
Dorusland stood firm for almost a month? The answer, my friends, is
obvious.
While Styrenia invited Opaques to enter their country and take jobs from
hardworking citizens, Dorusland resisted the blue advance. And now we
see why. The only explanation for the rapid invasion of Styrenia is the
Opaques. It must now be clear to all that they are working with the
Bugrom.&#39;

Fujisawa&#39;s morbid curiosity was suitably satisfied.

Jinnai glanced smugly at the apparently ordinary teenage boy behind
him. Here in Dorusland, it was necessary for Nahato to disguise himself
as somebody less conspicuous.
&quot;Prepare to witness some real intelligence work!&quot; Jinnai gloated. &quot;It
seems that you, with all your fancy powers of invisibility, still haven&#39;t
been able to capture the Purple Lightning. It&#39;s a good job that ONE of us
is competent.&quot;
&quot;You&#39;d be nowhere without us,&quot; Nahato frowned. &quot;We were the ones
who taught Sakura how to use her powers. We bombed the Stairway to
the Sky. And we replaced Fran&#39;s generals with doubles.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, well... you did what?&quot;
&quot;It was simple. Fran does whatever his generals tell him. We just had to
guide him to defeat.&quot;
&quot;Hmm,&quot; Jinnai pondered. &quot;I thought his tactics were a little odd...&quot;
&quot;Besides,&quot; Nahato cut in, &quot;this Purple Lightning could hardly be
considered a priority. He poses no threat.&quot;
Jinnai snarled. &quot;That&#39;s not the point! He&#39;s undermining my authority! If
the Dorusian resistance was a heavily armed militia or something,
people would understand why we couldn&#39;t catch them all straight away.
But no! The Dorusian resistance is one guy committing petty acts of
public nuisance. The fact that we haven&#39;t caught him yet makes us look
like idiots!&quot;
Groucho approached Jinnai. &quot;Qlnbg,&quot; he said. &quot;Xr bmdsk wsbrf.&quot;
&quot;Good,&quot; Jinnai nodded. He pointed to a house in front of them.
&quot;According to our tip-off, the Purple Lightning is hiding on the top floor
of that house.&quot;
&quot;In there?&quot; Nahato asked, incredulous. The house was clearly very old- a
tall, cheaply built stand-alone structure made mostly of wood.
Something wasn&#39;t quite right, he thought to himself. This could be
interesting...
&quot;Advance!&quot; Jinnai called to his troops. &quot;I want him alive!&quot;
One after another, the bugs charged through the door of the house. The
whole building shook as the bugs inside ascended the stairs.
&quot;Should you really be sending so many of them in there?&quot; Nahato asked.
&quot;The building doesn&#39;t look especially...&quot;
He was interrupted by the sound of splintering timber, followed by a
crash. Within seconds, the rickety house collapsed under the massive
weight of the Bugrom on the upper floors.
Jinnai approached the pile of bugs and broken wood. &quot;Groucho!&quot; he
shouted. &quot;Are you under there?&quot;
Groucho crawled out from underneath the incapacitated bugs. &quot;Hfnrl
bkhpt,&quot; he said pathetically.
&quot;Well?&quot; Jinnai probed. &quot;Did you find ANYTHING?&quot;
Groucho held out a piece of paper, which Jinnai snatched. Th writing
was Dorusian- he couldn&#39;t read it- but he recognised the signature.
&quot;The Purple Lightning,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;Damn. This whole thing
was just another set-up.&quot;
He turned to Nahato, expecting to see his usual smug face. Instead, the
boy was in conversation with an unfamiliar man.
&quot;Fine, dismissed,&quot; Nahato snapped. &quot;Mr Jinnai! Over here, now!&quot;
&quot;What?&quot; Jinnai demanded. &quot;And who was that guy?&quot;
&quot;One of my intelligence operatives. There are worrying developments in
Roshtaria. They have another Demon God on their side.&quot;
&quot;Damn,&quot; Jinnai cursed.
&quot;That&#39;s not all. Your old friend Mizuhara is planning something that
could wreck this whole operation.&quot;
&quot;What? What&#39;s he planning?&quot; Jinnai was suddenly agitated at the
mention of his rival&#39;s name.
&quot;That&#39;s not important right now,&quot; Nahato replied. &quot;He&#39;s working on it
with Ifurita and an Opaque traitor. Even if we kill Mizuhara and the
traitor, we probably won&#39;t be able to kill Ifurita. She&#39;d carry on the
work.&quot;
&quot;Well, is there anything we CAN do?&quot;
&quot;Yes. In order for their plan to succeed, they need the co-operation of
another Earthling- one I haven&#39;t heard of before. Her name is Kurai.&quot;
&quot;Kurai?&quot; Jinnai repeated a name he hadn&#39;t heard in four and a half years.
&quot;Surely not... Mari Kurai?&quot;
&quot;You know her?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, I remember her. She was the weirdest person I ever met.&quot;
&quot;Call Sakura,&quot; Nahato said. &quot;You have to kill this Mari Kurai as soon as
possible.&quot;

&quot;Set the frequency to three thousand eight hundred vibrations per
second,&quot; Makoto called.
Ifurita tapped the parameters into the ancient machine. &quot;Ready,&quot; she
replied.
&quot;I&#39;ve a feeling this is going to work,&quot; he smiled at Ifurita and Amiri. He
had long since given up smiling at Mari. She never smiled back.
&quot;Okay,&quot; he nodded to Mari. &quot;Now try to read me.&quot;
Mari put her hand on Makoto&#39;s shoulder, an action she was quite used to
by now.
&quot;And... start up the machine,&quot; Makoto called to Ifurita.
&quot;It&#39;s done,&quot; she called back.
&quot;I... can&#39;t read you,&quot; Mari said. &quot;There&#39;s some resistance.&quot;
&quot;But I can read you,&quot; Makoto replied. &quot;It&#39;s so much easier than it was
before.&quot;
&quot;Don&#39;t even think about doing that endorphin thing again,&quot; Mari
warned. &quot;I&#39;ve never been so embarrassed in all my life.&quot;
&quot;Ifurita,&quot; Amiri said, &quot;are you detecting the polarity of the energy
flow?&quot;
Ifurita nodded. &quot;Yes. It&#39;s... one hundred percent reversed. This is it! You
were right, Makoto. Spatial vibrations DO affect the polarity of micro-
energetic charges!&quot;
Makoto broke the link with Mari abruptly. &quot;I don&#39;t believe it. We may
have found a way to disrupt the Phantom Tribe&#39;s powers.&quot;
&quot;WE still have to determine the frequency of their powers,&quot; Ifurita
pointed out. &quot;Plus, we&#39;ll need to develop a delivery mechanism, and...&quot;
&quot;Never mind that for now,&quot; Makoto cut in. &quot;This is a major
breakthrough. We should celebrate, Ifurita! Doctor, will you join us?&quot;
&quot;Of course,&quot; Amiri smiled. &quot;Lead the way.&quot;
Makoto, Ifurita and Amiri filed out of the lab in high spirits. Only Mari
remained.
&quot;Not even so much as a thank you,&quot; she said to herself. &quot;Charming.&quot;

Nanami noticed the solitary figure standing in the middle of the
restaurant.
&quot;Mari?&quot; she said. &quot;We&#39;re not really open yet...&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s okay. I&#39;m not hungry.&quot;
Nanami smiled. &quot;Okay. Well, what brings you here? I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve
seen you here since you quit.&quot;
&quot;I just... I don&#39;t know,&quot; Mari sighed. &quot;I suppose I wanted someone to
talk to. Everybody&#39;s just been so busy recently.&quot;
&quot;Well, let&#39;s talk.&quot; Nanami sat at one of the tables, and gestured for Mari
to join her. Reluctantly, Mari took her lead.
&quot;So, what&#39;s on your mind?&quot; Nanami asked.
&quot;Everything,&quot; Mari replied. &quot;I&#39;m sick of this place. I want out. I mean,
for a while I thought it was cool. But now I realise it&#39;s just like Earth.
War, fighting, bigotry... People are just as stupid here as they are back
home.&quot;
&quot;Do you miss Earth at all?&quot;
Mari shook her head. &quot;Not especially. Like I said, Earth and El-Hazard
might as well be one and the same. My problems here are exactly the
same as they were on Earth.&quot;
&quot;What problems?&quot; Nanami probed.
Mari looked away. &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about it...&quot;
&quot;Please, Mari,&quot; Nanami pleaded. &quot;Tell me what&#39;s making you so sad. I
want to help.&quot;
&quot;You can&#39;t help!&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ll be the judge of that.&quot;
&quot;Okay, fine,&quot; Mari relented. &quot;But just remember, you were the one who
asked.&quot;
Nanami wasn&#39;t completely sure what that meant.
&quot;I was in love,&quot; Mari continued. &quot;Really in love. I&#39;d have done anything
for her, Nanami. But she didn&#39;t know. I couldn&#39;t tell her, for obvious
reasons. At best she&#39;d have been embarrassed. At worst, I&#39;d have been
made the laughing stock of the whole school. Again.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Nanami said. &quot;It sounds like you really cared about her.&quot;
&quot;I did. But in all the time I knew her, I hardly spoke to her. I was so
scared of saying something stupid. So I just watched her from afar. And
it destroyed me. Knowing she&#39;d never love me, waiting for some boy to
take her away from me...&quot; By now, Mari was close to tears.
&quot;Who was she? If you don&#39;t mind my asking?&quot;
&quot;I can&#39;t say...&quot;
&quot;What does it matter now? We&#39;re in El-Hazard.&quot;
&quot;Well...&quot; Mari sniffed, &quot;as I said before... my problems are exactly the
same here as they were on Earth.&quot;
It took Nanami a few seconds to assess the full ramifications of Mari&#39;s
last comment. By the time she&#39;d realised, tears were already streaming
down Mari&#39;s face.
&quot;Me?&quot; Nanami asked cautiously.
&quot;You have no idea,&quot; Mari sobbed, &quot;just how much I love you. You&#39;re
everything to me. You have been ever since the moment I first saw you.
If you so much as said hello to me, I&#39;d be in heaven. But I knew you
could never love someone... like me.&quot;
&quot;You should have said something,&quot; Nanami said.
&quot;Why? Would it have made any difference at all to you?&quot;
&quot;It does make a difference,&quot; Nanami insisted. &quot;Really, I&#39;m... very
flattered that you think so much of me.&quot;
Mari shook her head. &quot;No!&quot; she said between sobs. &quot;Please, credit me
with some intelligence. I can see how embarrassed you are. This is just
what I knew would happen.&quot;
&quot;Mari, I don&#39;t get it. If you thought for so long that I&#39;d reject you, why
didn&#39;t you look for someone else?&quot; Nanami asked.
&quot;It doesn&#39;t work like that!&quot; Mari insisted. &quot;You were the only one I
wanted. I&#39;d have given up anything... everything... just for you to love
me like I loved you. But no, fate decided not to let me have the one thing
I really wanted. Instead, it chose to taunt me with a constant reminder of
what I could have had, if only I&#39;d been good enough...&quot;
&quot;Mari, please!&quot; Nanami cut in. &quot;It&#39;s not a question of that. You are good
enough...&quot;
&quot;Then WHY?&quot; she screamed. &quot;WHY DON&#39;T YOU LOVE ME?&quot;
Mari got up and ran from the restaurant, crying.
Nanami stayed right where she was.
&quot;Oh my God...&quot; she said to herself.

Fatora sat in the centre of the war room, glancing from one map to
another.
&quot;Do we have any more information from Styrenia?&quot; she asked one of the
generals.
&quot;No, princess,&quot; came the reply. &quot;All lines of communication are down.
There&#39;s very little chance of...&quot;
&quot;Shut up and keep trying,&quot; she snapped.
&quot;Fatora...&quot; a voice said. &quot;You&#39;ve been trying this for days now.&quot;
Fatora looked to Alielle, who had just joined her in her elevated position
above the giant map. &quot;Alielle,&quot; she said, &quot;we have to get more
information about the fate of the Styrenian government. It&#39;s imperative
that we...&quot;
&quot;I know you&#39;re worried about your friend Formyka,&quot; Alielle interrupted.
&quot;Friend?&quot; Fatora said, incredulous. &quot;That bitch Formyka? Have you
gone insane? She&#39;s my sworn enemy, the bane of my existence! I don&#39;t
give a damn WHAT happens to her!&quot;
&quot;You&#39;ve obviously been giving it a lot of thought recently...&quot;
&quot;No I haven&#39;t! I... completely forgot that she rules Styrenia!&quot;
Alielle sighed. &quot;Whatever you say, Fatora. But you should know that it
IS possible to have someone as a rival and still care about what happens
to them.&quot;
Fatora put her head in her hands. &quot;That idiot. I bet she&#39;s got herself
killed somehow. That&#39;s just the kind of stupid thing she&#39;d do.&quot;
Alielle tugged Fatora&#39;s sleeve. &quot;Um... Fatora...&quot; she said, looking over at
the entrance.
&quot;Is THIS the war room?&quot; a familiar voice said. &quot;It&#39;s not as big as I
thought it would be. Ours is twice the size, and we&#39;ve never even had a
war! And just who decorated this place? Come on, was this EVER
fashionable?&quot;
&quot;Princess Formyka!&quot; Alielle called. &quot;You&#39;re okay! Wow, what a relief!&quot;
Fatora sighed, partly out of relief, partly out of trepidation. &quot;Had to turn
up HERE, didn&#39;t you?&quot;
&quot;Oh, Fatora, honey, you wouldn&#39;t believe what an adventure I had
getting here... evading the Bugrom for days on end, and with only five
changes of clothes!&quot; She pointed to her two servants, who were weighed
down with her luggage. &quot;Hey have you SEEN that new Demon God
Jinnai&#39;s using? Whoa! I&#39;d like to wind HER motor, if you get my drift!&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t believe it,&quot; Fatora said. &quot;She just participated in the conquest of
your country, and you want to have sex with her?&quot;
&quot;I think it&#39;s wrong to hold grudges.&quot;
Fatora shook her head. &quot;Well, now that you&#39;ve bravely deserted your
country, what do you plan on doing?&quot;
&quot;I deserted... I mean, temporarily vacated my country for a very good
reason,&quot; Formyka insisted. &quot;So that I could come here to Roshtaria, and
begin the official Styrenian government in exile. Okay, who wants to be
prime minister?&quot;
&quot;Me! Me!&quot; both of her servants shouted.
&quot;Okay...&quot; She pointed to the female servant. &quot;You can be prime
minister.&quot; She turned to the male servant. &quot;And you&#39;re my new defence
secretary.&quot;
&quot;Yay!&quot; they said in unison.
Formyka assumed a commanding pose. &quot;Believe me. We will not rest
until the Bugrom are expelled from our great land. No matter how long it
takes, no matter how much effort... we will prevail, and restore to
Styrenia the freedom it so rightly deserves.&quot;
&quot;Wow,&quot; Fatora whispered to Alielle.
Alielle nodded slightly. &quot;It looks like we&#39;re seeing another side to
Formyka.&quot;
&quot;Oh well,&quot; Formyka said. &quot;That&#39;s enough governing for the time being.
Who wants to go to the beach?&quot;
Her servants squealed in delight.
&quot;Okay then. Yeah, see you in a month or so, Fatora. Good luck with the
war and stuff.&quot;
She left the war room with her servants in tow.
&quot;That woman is unbelievable,&quot; Fatora sighed.
&quot;I know,&quot; Alielle replied. &quot;It&#39;s not even bikini weather.&quot;

&quot;I think she&#39;s a spy.&quot;
&quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding,&quot; Parnasse replied. &quot;Tenax, a spy? That&#39;s
completely ridiculous.&quot;
Mycea reclined on the grass. &quot;No it isn&#39;t. My dad says that a lot of the
Opaques are really spies for the Phantom Tribe.&quot;
&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; Parnasse nodded weakly. &quot;And they sent a highly trained
spy... to work in a restaurant? Come on.&quot;
&quot;Think about it!&quot; Mycea urged. &quot;Nanami was responsible for screwing
up their plans last time. So they sent Tenax to keep an eye on her.&quot;
&quot;Look, what&#39;s wrong with you? Why can&#39;t you trust her? Even the royal
house trust her. She&#39;s the student of my sister&#39;s doctor, you know.&quot;
Mycea&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;She&#39;s been in the palace? Well, that proves it!&quot;
&quot;No! It doesn&#39;t! You don&#39;t have any actual proof at all, do you?&quot;
They were both distracted by a loud noise overhead. Looking up, they
saw a giant object flying towards the city centre.
&quot;What the hell is THAT?&quot; Parnasse gasped.
&quot;I&#39;ve seen one of those before...&quot; Mycea replied. &quot;It&#39;s a... a Bugrom
transport! Oh my God, we&#39;re being invaded! They&#39;re here!&quot;
&quot;Mycea, I don&#39;t think...&quot;
She cowered behind Parnasse. &quot;Protect me, Parny! You can do it!&quot;
&quot;From BUGROM? Are you serious?&quot; he replied. &quot;Look, I don&#39;t think
they&#39;re invading. I only see one ship.&quot;
&quot;Then... why are they here?&quot;

The square had emptied rapidly upon the appearance of the transport.
Only four figures remained- Shayla, Afura, Qawoor and Fujisawa.
&quot;It must be a raid,&quot; Shayla said. &quot;But if it is, they&#39;re taking their time.&quot;
&quot;Perhaps they&#39;re selecting a target,&quot; Afura theorised. &quot;Although I&#39;m
surprised they aren&#39;t going straight for the palace. It&#39;s the obvious
choice.&quot;
&quot;Well, I hope they&#39;ve brought along that Demon God,&quot; Shayla said,
cracking her knuckles. &quot;It&#39;s payback time for that bitch!&quot;
Fujisawa shrugged. &quot;Who&#39;d have thought it? Sakura Tamaro, a Demon
God. She always had a reputation for being moody, but...&quot;
&quot;I rather hope she ISN&#39;T here,&quot; Afura said. &quot;Our last performance
against her was hardly exemplary.&quot;
&quot;I just hope they didn&#39;t bring any bugs,&quot; Qawoor sighed.

Jinnai didn&#39;t know what was more infuriating- the fact that there was a
flaw in his plan, or the fact that Sakura was the one who found it.
&quot;So how exactly am I supposed to find this girl? There&#39;s got to be
hundreds of thousands of people in this city.&quot;
&quot;Well...&quot; Jinnai replied, &quot;she&#39;s, um, very distinctive. You&#39;ll know her
when you see her.&quot;
&quot;But there&#39;s nobody down there!&quot; Sakura objected. &quot;They&#39;re all hiding!&quot;
Jinnai sighed. &quot;I guess we&#39;ll just have to get out and ask then, won&#39;t we?
Zeppo! Land this thing, will you?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re landing!&quot; Qawoor cried.
The transport descended to the ground, taking up almost half of the main
square. Jinnai stepped down from it, followed by Sakura.
&quot;Jinnai!&quot; Fujisawa said angrily. &quot;You have a lot of explaining to do,
young man.&quot;
&quot;Good afternoon, sensei,&quot; Jinnai acknowledged. &quot;It&#39;s a pleasure to see
you again. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve met Sakura. She&#39;s my new Ultimate
Weapon.&quot;
&quot;We&#39;re ready for you,&quot; Shayla snapped. &quot;Don&#39;t think you can just glide
in here and start attacking us!&quot;
&quot;Who said anything about attacking?&quot; Jinnai replied. &quot;I&#39;m just here to
ask a favour of you. I&#39;d like to know the whereabouts of one Mari
Kurai.&quot;
&quot;Who?&quot; Qawoor asked.
&quot;You know,&quot; Afura hissed. &quot;The scary girl who wears black.&quot;
Fujisawa frowned. &quot;We&#39;re not telling. I have a duty to protect my
students.&quot;
&quot;Oh well,&quot; Jinnai said. &quot;I don&#39;t suppose I can blame you for that.
Unfortunately, without this information, Sakura might just be forced to
LEVEL THIS CITY!&quot; He started to laugh uncontrollably.
Sakura looked at Jinnai quizzically. &quot;Um, Katsuhiko?&quot; she said, barely
audible over his laughter. &quot;Katsuhiko? HEY, KATSUHIKO!&quot;
Jinnai ceased laughing abruptly. &quot;What?&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m confused. Do you want me to destroy this city or not?&quot;
&quot;Idiot!&quot; Jinnai exploded. &quot;What do YOU think?&quot;
&quot;Ummm...&quot; Sakura paused, obviously deep in thought. Jinnai waited
patiently for a few seconds, but it soon became evident that an answer
was not forthcoming.
&quot;Forget it! I don&#39;t have the time to stand here and wait on the offchance
that your minuscule brain will ever come up with anything of any
significance. Now, just do your job and blow this city up!&quot;
&quot;Okay!&quot; Sakura rose effortlessly up into the sky, then added, with a
slightly annoyed expression- &quot;You could have just said so...&quot;
&quot;Stop!&quot; a voice said from overhead. Ifurita descended from the sky with
Makoto on her back, followed closely by Three.
Jinnai jumped back. &quot;Mizuhara? Shit! Sakura! Shoot him, now!&quot;
There was no response.
&quot;Sakura?&quot; he called. &quot;Are you listening to me? I thought I told you to...&quot;
Sakura winced. &quot;Too much... too much... energy!&quot;
She began to fire wildly in all directions. The large black bubbles she
produced hovered around her, and shrank down until they were barely
visible.
&quot;What&#39;s she doing?&quot; Makoto asked.
Three frowned. &quot;Zero energy. It is more versatile than it appears to be.&quot;
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;
&quot;Until now, you told me that you had only seen it used to drain energy
from others. But it has more uses.&quot;
The tiny bubbles shot outwards and slammed into the surrounding
buildings. Chunks of masonry exploded upon the impact and flew out in
all directions.
Jinnai took shelter behind his bugs. &quot;Sakura! Have you gone crazy?
You&#39;re gonna get me killed!&quot;
&quot;How does she do that?&quot; Makoto gasped.
&quot;Manipulation of air pressure,&quot; Three replied. &quot;The zero energy bubbles
drain energy from the air trapped inside them. The air cools and
contracts, so the bubble shrinks. Then she launches the bubble at the
target. It breaks on impact, the air heats up again and expands rapidly,
hence the explosion.&quot;
&quot;Makoto!&quot; Ifurita called out in distress. &quot;I&#39;m detecting something...
unpleasant.&quot;
&quot;Could you be more specific?&quot; Three asked irritably.
&quot;No. It&#39;s just... something.&quot;
Another, considerably larger explosion was heard above. More rubble
rained down on the square.&quot;
&quot;Sakura!&quot; Jinnai yelled. &quot;This is all very impressive, but would you
PLEASE let me get out of the way first? Damn it, I said STOP!&quot;
&quot;Why won&#39;t she listen to him?&quot; Makoto asked.
&quot;Previously, you expressed surprise that Sakura was capable of such
destruction. I am beginning to doubt that she has total control over her
actions.&quot;
&quot;You mean something&#39;s controlling her?&quot;
&quot;I think so. Perhaps it is her Demon God half. Perhaps something else...&quot;
Shayla looked over at Fujisawa. &quot;We&#39;ve got to do something. Come on.&quot;
&quot;Right,&quot; Fujisawa nodded. &quot;I&#39;m with you.&quot;
Fujisawa charged up the side of the nearest building. At the same time,
Shayla launched herself up towards Sakura.
&quot;Hee-yaaa!&quot; Shayla cried, sending a volley of fire in Sakura&#39;s direction.
She barely noticed. Shayla&#39;s fire was harmlessly absorbed by one of the
nearby zero energy bubbles. From the opposite direction, Fujisawa
soared through the air in pursuit of Sakura. &quot;Fujisawa... KICK!&quot;
Sakura casually looked over her shoulder at him, and directed one of the
bubbles to shield her.
Fujisawa hit the bubble, which exploded with an almighty bang, sending
him flying through the wall of a nearby house.
&quot;Hey!&quot; Shayla objected. &quot;You&#39;re gonna pay for that!&quot;
Sakura slammed a bubble at high speed into Shayla&#39;s abdomen. She
ricocheted off one building, into another, and landed painfully on the
ground. Her body twitched as random sparks of fire shot from her.
&quot;Shayla!&quot; Afura ran towards her, followed by Makoto, Ifurita, Three and
Qawoor.
&quot;What&#39;s happening to her?&quot; Makoto demanded, horrified.
&quot;I don&#39;t know. Help me remove the Lamp from her, quickly! The rest of
you, try to hold Sakura back.&quot;
Qawoor nodded and ran back to the centre of the square. Ifurita and
Three took off to engage Sakura. Makoto and Afura wrestled with the
convulsing Shayla, eventually releasing the Lamp of Fire from her arm.
Her body went limp.
&quot;Thank God,&quot; Afura sighed in relief. &quot;I think she&#39;s okay now.&quot;
&quot;What about the Lamp?&quot; Makoto asked.
&quot;It looked like it sustained some damage. It can be repaired.&quot;
Shayla murmured. &quot;That... skinny bitch!&quot;
&quot;Yes, she&#39;s okay,&quot; Afura nodded to Makoto.
Ifurita and Three circled Sakura from a safe distance.
&quot;I should warn you,&quot; Ifurita called, &quot;my program prohibits me from
attacking Sakura.&quot;
&quot;I know,&quot; Three replied. &quot;Try to keep her distracted.&quot;
Ifurita darted to and fro before Sakura in an elaborate, zig-zagging
pattern. The part of Sakura still semi-aware of her situation assumed
there was some method to this. There wasn&#39;t.
A split second later, Three fired a volley of energy blasts into Sakura&#39;s
back. Sakura cried out in pain, and seemed momentarily confused.
Qawoor, standing below, sensed her chance to strike. She raised her
arms in preparation, and suddenly noticed something black heading
towards her.
Qawoor&#39;s screams echoed across the square.
&quot;What happened?&quot; Afura gasped.
&quot;I saw something hit her,&quot; Makoto replied. &quot;Something black. It seemed
to come out of one of the bubbles.&quot;
&quot;Get it out of me!&quot; Qawoor screamed. Suddenly, her protests subsided.
&quot;Sorry,&quot; she said in a calm voice. &quot;That was most undignified.&quot;
Afura ran towards her. &quot;Qawoor, are you okay?&quot;
Qawoor answered her concern with a well-targeted jet of water.
&quot;Keep away!&quot; she warned. &quot;Sakura! Can you hear me?&quot;
Sakura looked down at her, apparently confused.
&quot;The Ifurita behind you is vulnerable to your attacks. You would be well
advised to target her head and spinal column in particular.&quot;
Afura struggled to her feet. &quot;Qawoor, what the hell are you doing?&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s not Qawoor!&quot; Makoto called. &quot;There&#39;s something controlling
her, I&#39;m sure of it!&quot;
&quot;In that case, I&#39;ll have to persuade it to leave,&quot; Afura said. &quot;Qawoor, I&#39;m
sorry about this, but...&quot;
She called a tornado into being, and hurled it at Qawoor. Unprepared,
Qawoor was swept up by it.
&quot;Stop!&quot; she called. &quot;Can&#39;t... keep... hold on...&quot;
&quot;There it is!&quot; Ifurita exclaimed. &quot;It&#39;s leaving!&quot;
A translucent black dart made its escape from Qawoor&#39;s body and flew
aimlessly away from her. It collided with an unsuspecting Makoto.

Makoto stared up through the blackness. It was like looking into infinity
itself.
&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; he demanded.
Fleeting images made patterns in the darkness. Odd, abstract shapes,
which might just have been faces...
&quot;I know you&#39;re there! He insisted. &quot;Show yourself!&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s been too long,&quot; a voice replied. &quot;Hello, Makoto Mizuhara. What an
unexpected pleasure.&quot;
Makoto gasped. &quot;That voice... I know you!&quot;
&quot;You most certainly do. You know me through your beloved Ifurita, and
through your friend Qawoor Towles. The greatest mind in El-Hazard&#39;s
history... the creator of the Eye of God... But you know me best by
another name.&quot;
The face formed in the blackness before Makoto, and he was no longer
in any doubt.
&quot;Arjah,&quot; Makoto said. &quot;You&#39;re... the one who created Ifurita? You&#39;re the
man I saw in her mind! Jahad Ito Arundel... and Arjah... are one and the
same, aren&#39;t they?&quot;
&quot;Well deduced, Makoto Mizuhara.&quot;
Makoto frowned. &quot;But you&#39;re dead. You died thousands of years ago.&quot;
&quot;Death is such an imprecise term, wouldn&#39;t you say?&quot; Arjah replied.
&quot;Let me give you some advice, my friend. Be very careful with zero
energy...&quot;
His image flitted from one side of Makoto to the other. &quot;Look at me. The
zero energy that enveloped me did something extraordinary. I became
one with it. Now I am composed entirely of zero energy.&quot;
&quot;But that&#39;s impossible,&quot; Makoto stated. &quot;Zero energy is literally nothing.
You can&#39;t be composed of nothing.&quot;
&quot;That all depends on your definition of nothing,&quot; Arjah rebutted. &quot;I have
existed in this state for thousands of years. It&#39;s been quite an experience.
But recently, I&#39;ve begun to tire of such an existence. Omniscience can
get so repetitive...&quot;
&quot;Omniscience? Are you trying to tell me you know everything?&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s no idle claim, Makoto Mizuhara. I exist in the centre of a
dimensional vortex. I see everything. Everything.&quot;
Makoto shook his head. &quot;Another deception, I&#39;ll bet. Didn&#39;t you once
claim to be some high priest of dimensions?&quot;
&quot;I speak the truth!&quot; Arjah bellowed, indignant. &quot;I have witnessed every
second of your life. I saw your birth, in that underdeveloped dimensional
backwater you call home. I watched your childhood, your adolescence...
your earl, feeble attempts to curry favour with your friend Nanami. I saw
your journey to El-Hazard, and your subsequent bungling attempts to
duplicate my genius. Then, I witnessed your success, and the first night
you spent with my creation, Ifurita...&quot;
Makoto said nothing. He stood his ground.
&quot;Tell me,&quot; Arjah smiled, &quot;were you impressed? I&#39;d always wondered
how she&#39;d perform in that capacity...&quot;
&quot;Shut up!&quot; Makoto demanded. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you? Why have you
been watching me so obsessively?&quot;
&quot;Didn&#39;t you hear me? I see all! Every second of every life in a vast
multitude of dimensions. Yours is just one of many. For millennia I have
witnessed the lives of great leaders, scientists, artists and warriors...
every moment of their lives.&quot; With a slight sigh, he added- &quot;It&#39;s really
not as interesting as you&#39;d imagine.&quot;
&quot;What do you want?&quot; Makoto challenged.
&quot;What do you think? I want to exist, just as you do. I&#39;m tired of
immortality. Soon, my life will be restored.&quot;
&quot;How?&quot;
Arjah laughed. &quot;I&#39;ve seen enough to know not to reveal my plans to you.
I think it would be more entertaining to let you find out for yourself.&quot;
The images around Makoto began to distort. Arjah&#39;s voice grew distant.
&quot;We&#39;ll meet again soon, Makoto Mizuhara. My influence in this world is
growing...&quot;
Everything went white.

&quot;Did you see him too?&quot;
Makoto groaned and squinted up at the figure above him. &quot;Qawoor?&quot;
Qawoor knelt down beside him. &quot;What WAS he?&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ve seen him before,&quot; Makoto sighed. &quot;And just when I thought things
couldn&#39;t get any more complicated...&quot;
Above them, the battle raged on. Sakura&#39;s power seemed to be building,
as she fired at Three with increasing rapidity.
One f the bubbles hit. Three jerked back and winced.
&quot;Three!&quot; Ifurita cried. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;
Three stayed silent for a few seconds, trying to regain her bearings. Then
she smiled slightly.
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Ifurita. What doesn&#39;t kill you...&quot;
She pointed her staff at Sakura.
&quot;...can only make you stronger.&quot;
A stream of black bubbles shot from the staff and slammed into Sakura.
Three descended unsteadily, exhausted. Sakura dropped
unceremoniously out of the sky, landing in the transport where Jinnai
and the bugs were hiding.
She looked up. &quot;Whoa... what happened?&quot;
Jinnai ran over. &quot;Sakura! You okay?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, I think so,&quot; she said, getting up. She noticed the rubble around
her. &quot;Hey, who did this?&quot;
&quot;YOU did, you dummy! Don&#39;t you remember?&quot;
A small, black clad figure walked into the square.
&quot;Shit,&quot; said Mari to no-one in particular. &quot;What&#39;s going on here?&quot;
Makoto was the first to notice her presence. &quot;Aagh! Mari, you have to
get out of here!&quot;
&quot;Why?&quot;
&quot;Just do it!&quot;
&quot;But I want to know what&#39;s happening...&quot;
Jinnai gasped as he saw his target. &quot;Sakura! That&#39;s her! Next to
Mizuhara! Kill her, and hurry!&quot;
&quot;Right.&quot; Sakura flew out of the transport and towards the figure.
&quot;YOU?&quot;
Sakura stopped in mid air. A few feet away from Mari.
&quot;Hey,&quot; Mari said. &quot;I remember you. You&#39;re that singer I met in
Shinonome. What&#39;s your name again? Hell, I&#39;ve forgotten. Was it Saeko
something?&quot;
&quot;Aaaargh!&quot; Sakura growled. &quot;What is the MATTER with you? All of
this and you still don&#39;t know who I am? Oh, I&#39;m gonna enjoy this!&quot;
Mari tilted her head innocently. &quot;Enjoy what?&quot;
Sakura jabbed her Power Key Unit into Mari&#39;s chest and fired.
Mari fell backwards silently.
&quot;No!&quot; Makoto cried. &quot;My God, what have you done?&quot;
&quot;Yeah...&quot; a voice said. &quot;That really, really hurt. What&#39;s your problem?&quot;
Mari got to her feet and regarded Sakura with a hurt expression.
&quot;Mari, you&#39;re still alive!&quot; Makoto exclaimed. &quot;How?&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;d like to know,&quot; Sakura frowned. &quot;Die!&quot;
She fired another round. Mari stumbled back slightly.
&quot;Hey!&quot; she objected.
Still no effect. Sakura grumbled and fired a succession of blasts into
Mari.
Bang.
&quot;Ow!&quot;
Boom.
&quot;Stop it!&quot;
Bang.
&quot;Bitch!&quot;
Boom.
&quot;I&#39;m warning you! I&#39;ll start hitting back!&quot;
Sakura  withdrew her weapon. &quot;Damn it, why do you insist on making
me look like an idiot? Why don&#39;t you just die?&quot;
&quot;Sakura!&quot; Jinnai called. &quot;We haven&#39;t got time for this! Just do
something!&quot;
&quot;Hmm...&quot; Sakura held up her Power Key Unit, and studied it carefully
from a variety of angles. Then, with masterful precision, she brought it
down hard on Mari&#39;s head.
Mari fell to the ground. Sakura picked her up and took off.
&quot;Fantastic.&quot;
She deposited Mari in the transport and smiled at Jinnai. &quot;Look! I did
it!&quot;
&quot;What are you grinning at? Do you want praise, is that it?
&#39;Congratulations, Sakura, you managed to knock a schoolgirl
unconscious on your seventh attempt?&#39; You&#39;re the lamest Ultimate
Weapon I&#39;ve ever seen! Zeppo! Get us out of here, now!&quot;
The transport lifted off the ground.
&quot;I&#39;ll follow them!&quot; Three said. &quot;I can still fight Sakura...&quot;
&quot;Your energy levels have been critically reduced,&quot; Ifurita warned. &quot;And
I&#39;m detecting several errors in your combative systems.&quot;
Three grimaced. &quot;I... was not designed to use zero energy. I&#39;m having
problems integrating the technique into my arsenal... but I can still...&quot;
She fell to her knees. By now, the transport was just a dot on the
horizon.

Mari awoke to the sound of laughter.
She glanced around. She was in... well, what WAS it? The walls and
surfaces looked vaguely organic...
Right, this must be the hive.
She quickly located the source of the laughter. Jinnai was standing a
short distance away, with an unfamiliar woman at his side. Other figures
stood behind the, but she couldn&#39;t make them out through the shadows.
&quot;See that?&quot; Jinnai said to the woman. &quot;One of Mizuhara&#39;s allies, AND
the key to one of his devious plans!&quot;
&quot;Very good,&quot; the woman replied, a little wearily.
&quot;I&#39;m telling you, Diva, this is... oh, you&#39;re awake, are you? Well, Kurai,
prepare to witness the might of my legions! Come forth!&quot;
Two giant, bipedal insects stepped out from the shadows. Mari looked at
them with an expression of mild surprise.
&quot;See?&quot; Jinnai smiled at Diva. &quot;She&#39;s struck dumb with terror! What do
you think, Kurai? What do you say to THAT?&quot;
Mari remained silent for a while longer, a question obviously forming in
her head. Finally, she spoke.
&quot;How do they breathe?&quot;
Jinnai&#39;s expression of superiority changed to one of utter bewilderment.
&quot;W... what? What kind of question is that?&quot;
&quot;Well,&quot; Mari clarified, &quot;insects on Earth absorb oxygen directly through
numerous apertures in the skin, and distribute it via a series of internal
tracheae... but taking into account the body mass to surface area ratio,
that system almost certainly wouldn&#39;t work for such large creatures. Too
much mass. I wonder if they have lungs instead...&quot;
&quot;Hey! Shut up!&quot; Jinnai commanded. &quot;I don&#39;t care! Now, aren&#39;t you the
least bit impressed with my magnificent followers?&quot;
&quot;Oh, sorry,&quot; Mari apologised. &quot;They&#39;re very nice.&quot;
Jinnai put a hand to his head. &quot;NICE?&quot;
&quot;Mm-hmm. I especially like the purple one. Do they all have names?&quot;
Jinnai nodded. &quot;They certainly do. Groucho! Escort our scientifically
curious friend to the cells!&quot;
Groucho walked forward, took a closer look at Mari, then quickly
retreated.
&quot;What?&quot; Jinnai demanded of the bug now cowering behind him.
&quot;Hnpshk nmtr!&quot; Grouch said meekly.
&quot;She&#39;s what? Death? Don&#39;t be pathetic! She&#39;s just a chick in a black
dress!&quot;
Diva looked carefully at Mari. &quot;She does look remarkably like the
legendary incarnation of Death...&quot;
&quot;Well, I know her better than any of you, and she ISN&#39;T Death!&quot; Jinnai
shouted. &quot;Margaret! YOU take her away!&quot;
Margaret whimpered an objection.
&quot;Do as he commands!&quot; Diva said.
Margaret reluctantly took hold of Mari and began to lead her away.
&quot;Margaret?&quot; Mari said. &quot;That&#39;s a crap name for a bug. If I had a bug, I&#39;d
name it Lora, after Lora Logic, saxophone player in the original line up
of the legendary X-Ray Spex. Or perhaps the drummer. What was he
called again? Oh...&quot;
&quot;She&#39;s too weird,&quot; Jinnai sighed.
Diva looked to the other bugs in the room. &quot;You are all dismissed. I wish
to speak privately with Mr Jinnai.&quot;
The bugs quickly obliged and left. Jinnai gulped. Whenever Diva did
this it was always bad news.
&quot;As you know, I will lay the new queen&#39;s egg in a few days,&quot; she said.
&quot;However...&quot;
&quot;What?&quot; Jinnai urged.
&quot;My condition is deteriorating rapidly. Much faster than I thought it
would. I fear I may not live to see the new queen hatch.&quot;
&quot;B... but...&quot; Jinnai stammered, &quot;you have to educate her!&quot;
&quot;I know. This has never happened before. But then, in the history of our
Empire, no queen has ever had to replenish such a large portion of the
population. I suspect my constant breeding has quickened the onset of
my demise. For any other queen in our history, this could mean disaster,
but...&quot;
She smiled at Jinnai. &quot;Fortunately, I have you. My messenger from God.
You can educate the new queen for me...&quot;
Jinnai shuddered. Oh God.

Day 242

&quot;Come on, Miz. It&#39;s been two weeks.&quot;
Miz frowned. &quot;Now, Shayla. You know it&#39;s dangerous to use the Lamps
unless you&#39;re fully fit.&quot;
&quot;But I am! I&#39;ve completely recovered!&quot;
Shayla looked across Miz&#39;s living room at Afura, Qawoor and Fujisawa,
hoping for some support. Afura nodded.
&quot;She&#39;s right, Miz. She seems as fit as ever.&quot;
&quot;Very well, then. I&#39;ve managed to repair the Lamp casing. You really
should be more careful though, Shayla. This is the second casing you&#39;ve
broken...&quot;
&quot;I fell on it!&quot; Shayla said defensively.
&quot;Well, whatever happened, it&#39;s repaired now.&quot; Miz handed the Lamp of
Fire to Shayla. &quot;Go on, check it&#39;s working. But just a small test. These
are new curtains.&quot;
&quot;Okay!&quot; Shayla strapped the Lamp to he arm excitedly. &quot;At last, some
power! I feel...&quot;
She paused.
&quot;Uh oh.&quot;
&quot;What?&quot; Fujisawa prompted.
Shayla went through a rapid succession of poses, all of which would
have looked very impressive had they been accompanied by fire.
&quot;It&#39;s not working!&quot; she said, alarmed. &quot;I don&#39;t feel a thing!&quot;
Miz looked perplexed. &quot;Give me the Lamp. I&#39;ll take a look.&quot;
Shayla removed the Lamp and handed it to Miz, who placed it on the
table. The others gathered around her as she prised the object open with
a metal rod.
&quot;The source seems to be intact.&quot;
Miz prodded the source, a mall chunk of red stone, with her metal tool.
It glowed brilliant orange in response to the contact.
&quot;It should be working,&quot; Miz shrugged. &quot;The source is fine.&quot;
&quot;Do you think the zero energy attack could have something to do with
this?&quot; Qawoor offered.
Afura nodded slightly. &quot;Well, it did make you lose control of the Lamp,
Shayla.&quot;
Miz considered this. &quot;Hmm. The link between a priestess and her Lamp
is very sensitive. And we don&#39;t really know how this zero energy works,
or what it can do. It&#39;s possible that your link to the lamp has been
damaged.&quot;
&quot;But... what does that mean?&quot;
Afura sighed. &quot;It could be only temporary. But if your link&#39;s been
severed completely, you may have to re-learn your elemental abilities
from scratch.&quot;
Shayla&#39;s jaw dropped. &quot;That... could take years!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s going to take years.&quot;
Nanami gasped. &quot;You&#39;re kidding!&quot;
Makoto shook his head. &quot;Afraid not. Three says the Stairway was so
badly damaged, it&#39;ll be at least two years before the princesses can use
the Eye of God again. And that&#39;s if we start repairs straight away.&quot;
&quot;What&#39;s happening to this world?&quot; Nanami sighed. &quot;I&#39;d just got settled
here. Now everything just... seems to be going to hell.&quot;
&quot;You&#39;re not usually this pessimistic.&quot;
Nanami looked to the floor. &quot;It&#39;s ever since my brother took Mari.&quot;
&quot;I know,&quot; Makoto said. &quot;Well, at least we got enough data from our
experiments on her to proceed with our...&quot;
&quot;Makoto!&quot; Nanami interrupted angrily. &quot;Never mind your damn
experiments! The girl&#39;s been kidnapped! She could be dead!&quot;
&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ve just been doing so much research lately, it&#39;s all I
think about. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s okay.&quot;
&quot;You think?&quot;
He nodded. &quot;Well, zero energy doesn&#39;t seem to harm her for a start.
Must be another side effect of her ability...&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I got angry,&quot; Nanami said. &quot;It&#39;s just... something happened a
few hours before she was kidnapped. She, well... she told me she loved
me.&quot;
&quot;She what?&quot; Makoto responded, incredulous. &quot;Seriously?&quot;
&quot;She seemed pretty serious about it.&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Makoto said. &quot;Mari says a lot of things.&quot;
Nanami moved closer to Makoto. &quot;She meant it. I know she did. And
ever since she said it, I can&#39;t help feeling responsible...&quot;
&quot;For what?&quot;
&quot;For her. She was so upset that I didn&#39;t love her. I feel like I&#39;m to blame
for screwing up her life.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s not true,&quot; Makoto reassured. &quot;What could you have done?&quot;
&quot;I could have paid more attention. If I&#39;d worked it out sooner, maybe I
could have... I don&#39;t know. But it all seems so obvious now. That&#39;s the
reason why she was always so shy around me... why she was so keen to
make me happy. I just wish I&#39;d had the chance to straighten things out
with her. But now I might never see her again.&quot;
&quot;You will,&quot; Makoto said. &quot;We&#39;ll get her back. I&#39;m certain we haven&#39;t
seen the last of her.&quot;
Nanami sat down sadly. &quot;I hope you&#39;re right, Makoto.&quot;

&quot;Come on,&quot; Alielle smiled. &quot;You wanted me to teach you how to enjoy
yourself, didn&#39;t you?&quot;
&quot;But... it just seems so cruel,&quot; Rune replied.
&quot;It&#39;s also funny. Funny outranks cruel. That&#39;s what Fatora taught me.&quot;
Rune was clearly tempted. &quot;Well... alright. But just this once.&quot;
&quot;Okay!&quot; Alielle grinned. &quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot;
She and Rune stepped out into the corridor. Londs was standing nearby.
&quot;Go on!&quot; Alielle hissed to Rune. &quot;You start!&quot;
Rune blushed.
&quot;And stop blushing!&quot;
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Rune whispered. She regained her composure, and, making
sure that Londs could hear, began.
&quot;Alielle... I&#39;ve never felt this way about anyone before.&quot;
Out of the corner of her eye, Alielle could see Londs&#39; sudden expression
of surprise. She suppressed the urge to smile, and answered Rune.
&quot;Nor have I, Rune.&quot;
&quot;But...&quot; Rune continued, momentarily forgetting what came next, &quot;I&#39;m
so scared of these feelings. I don&#39;t understand them.&quot;
By now it was all Londs could do to disguise his horror.
&quot;You will, Rune,&quot; Alielle replied. &quot;I&#39;ll show you how...&quot;
They walked, arm in arm, past Londs. Rune looked up at him.
&quot;Londs, you look like you&#39;re about to say something. Is something
wrong?&quot;
&quot;N... nothing...&quot; he stammered.
&quot;Oh, good.&quot; Rune and Alielle walked off down the corridor, and turned
the corner. A few seconds later, Londs heard hysterical laughter.
&quot;That was brilliant,&quot; said a voice that sounded a lot like Alielle&#39;s.
&quot;Fatora will be SO proud!&quot;

&quot;Where are we going?&quot; Parnasse asked for the fifth time as Mycea
dragged him along the street.
&quot;You&#39;ll see when we get there,&quot; she replied.
Parnasse thought he could hear shouting. &quot;Hey... do you hear that?&quot;
&quot;We&#39;re almost there now...&quot;
They reached the end of the street, and Parnasse could see the source of
the raised voices.
Some sort of march. Very well attended, too. There must have been at
least a thousand, and that was only the group he could see.
&quot;What is it?&quot;
&quot;They&#39;re protesting against the Opaques,&quot; Mycea smiled.
Parnasse&#39;s eyebrows almost jumped off his face. &quot;You brought me here
so we could watch THIS?&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;I thought we could join in.&quot;
&quot;WHAT? NO! NO WAY!&quot;
&quot;How come?&quot;
Parnasse didn&#39;t know where to begin. &quot;Because... because I don&#39;t agree
with it, for a start! Can&#39;t you understand that?&quot;
&quot;But EVERYONE agrees with it. You&#39;re just not informed enough on
the subject. My dad says...&quot;
That was when Parnasse realised something unnerving. All the time that
he had been trying to change Mycea, she had been working to change
him.
The protestors moved ever closer, their chant of &#39;Blues out&#39; now echoing
in his head.
He took Mycea&#39;s arm. &quot;Come on. We&#39;re leaving.&quot;
&quot;But we just got here.&quot;
He groaned. &quot;Mycea, it&#39;s dangerous! This is an Opaque area they&#39;re
marching through. Doesn&#39;t that tell you something?&quot;
Mycea stared back blankly.
&quot;They&#39;re looking for a fight! They&#39;re trying to provoke the Opaques!&quot;
&quot;But it&#39;s a peaceful protest,&quot; Mycea objected. &quot;It&#39;s not our fault if they
choose to attack us. We&#39;re just exercising our democratic right...&quot;
Parnasse closed his eyes. &quot;It must be me. That&#39;s the only solution. This
all makes perfect sense, and I&#39;m the one who&#39;s crazy. Right?&quot;
He opened his eyes again.
&quot;Uh oh.&quot;
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Mycea responded. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;
group of Opaques had wandered unintentionally into the path of the
protestors. They were doing their best to get out of the way, but this was
the opportunity the protestors had been waiting for.
Opaques, they had discovered, were extremely difficult, to provoke,
upset, or even annoy. Most Opaques still had vivid memories of the
appalling treatment they&#39;d suffered at the hands of the Phantom Tribe, so
were quite prepared to put up with the bigotry they faced in Roshtaria.
Well, if they weren&#39;t going to be provoked, this was the next best thing.
A number of the ringleaders began to chase after the Opaques. In the
space of ten seconds, the peaceful protest descended into little more than
a riot.
&quot;Stay if you want,&quot; Parnasse frowned. &quot;I&#39;m going.&quot;
He suddenly realised his way out was blocked. The protestors were
swarming everywhere, and getting angrier by the second. He tried to
push past them, but it just seemed to make matters worse. Fights were
breaking out in sections of the crowd. Shit. There was no escape.
&quot;Let me through!&quot; a female voice cried. &quot;For God&#39;s sake, let me
through!&quot;
Parnasse caught sight of the woman. &quot;Hey,&quot; he called, helping her
through, &quot;are you a doctor? There are people getting...&quot;
&quot;No, no,&quot; she replied. &quot;I&#39;m a journalist. Wait a second...&quot;
She looked at him closely. &quot;Sorry, I mistook you for someone important.
Has anyone ever told you that you look just like...&quot;
She caught sight of a fight nearby. &quot;Never mind.&quot; She hurried over and
took out her notebook. &quot;Kagsi Vulpix, Roshtarian Observer,&quot; she said to
one of the combatants. &quot;Could you tell me how you feel right now, sir?&quot;
A string of unusually philosophical thoughts drifted through Parnasse&#39;s
head as he struggled to find a way out. What made people do this? Were
the Opaques really a threat? Did these people really even consider the
Opaques to be a threat? Or did they just want someone to hit out at?
Something behind him exploded. He didn&#39;t bother to look back. He had
already come to a conclusion anyway.
&quot;This... SUCKS!&quot; he yelled.
