EL-HAZARD: THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME

The Shape of Things So Far-

The outspoken Holy Order advisor Jennown Doht visits the priestesses to
check their progress with the prophecy. Shayla does not trust him, and
reveals just a fraction of the full text to him. Parnasse discovers to his
horror that Mari is a lesbian, while Mycea takes advantage of the situation
and seduces him. As a test of her power, Jinnai sends Sakura to attack the
priestesses. She defeats Shayla and Afura easily, but is somehow prevented
from harming Qawoor, and reaches a bizarre stalemate with Ifurita when
neither Demon God can fire. Amiri is the victim of a racist attack and is
left with a broken arm. Mari tries to make amends with Fujisawa, but gets
angry when he disapproves of her friendship with Alielle and Fatora. The
Alpha Priestess dies, and is replaced with Serati, a relative unknown.
Relations with Dorusland deteriorate as Fran makes increasingly extreme
demands- eventually the country withdraws from the Alliance. Nahato
immediately selects the nation as a suitably vulnerable target for Jinnai&#39;s
first attack.

THE SIXTH MONTH: &quot;THE END STARTS TODAY&quot;

Day 153

On Earth, they say that behind every great man stands a great woman. In
El-Hazard, which is in most cases a reasonably enlightened society, this
phrase would no doubt be rejected as hopelessly outmoded and sexist.
And it&#39;s easy to see why. While on Earth, pre-determined gender roles may
persist, this is generally not the case in El-Hazard. Often behind a great
woman, there may stand a great man, for example Ifurita and Makoto Mizuhara.
In some of the more liberally minded corners of the Alliance, the situation
gets even more complicated- a great woman may be backed up by a person of
either gender. The most obvious instance of this is Princess Fatora, who has
Alielle- a great woman- behind her, as well as frequently in front of her,
on top of her, underneath her, and in a great deal of other elaborate
positions that would make the researchers for the Kama Sutra blush.

Having considered this, there are also cases in El-Hazard where the original
saying holds true. Katsuhiko Jinnai, as commander of the Bugrom forces,
would never have achieved his position were it not for the approval of Queen
Diva.
Diva preferred to remain behind the scenes. Nobody from the Alliance had
ever actually seen her, whilst everyone agreed they had seen rather too much
of Jinnai. Diva&#39;s low profile was simply a consequence of what she
considered to be the queen&#39;s function. Roles in Bugrom society were well
defined. It was her job to maintain the Empire, to protect it and replenish
it if necessary. There was only ever one queen, and without her the Empire
would eventually crumble and die. It was vital, therefore, for Diva to keep
herself well protected.
Other than that, she did little. She left the complicated business of
directing battles up to Jinnai. That was his role, and she thought it best
not to interfere.
Recently, though, Diva had started to worry about him. The fact that he put
up with Sakura&#39;s insolence was bad enough- but his relationship with Nahato,
the Phantom Tribe leader, was nothing short of unbelievable. It even seemed,
at times, as if Jinnai was taking orders from him.

&quot;I do not trust him.&quot;
&quot;Nahato?&quot; Jinnai raised an eyebrow quizzically. &quot;How come?&quot;
&quot;The Phantom Tribe traditionally have little regard for the Bugrom,&quot; Diva
said. &quot;For them to shift their position so suddenly seems strange. Why are
they so eager to help us?&quot;
&quot;Simple,&quot; Jinnai replied. &quot;We share a common goal. The destruction of the
Alliance. War makes strange bedfellows, as they say.&quot;
Diva nodded. &quot;Indeed. But when the war is over... when the Alliance is no
more, and all that remains is the Bugrom and the Phantom Tribe... what then?
Will the Phantom Tribe really be content to allow us to be the dominant
force in El-Hazard?&quot;
&quot;In truth,&quot; Jinnai said, &quot;I don&#39;t really trust Nahato either. Right now,
he&#39;s valuable, but I don&#39;t plan on keeping him here any longer than
necessary. I have no intention of conquering El-Hazard just so the Phantom
Tribe can take it from me.&quot;
&quot;Do you really believe we could win in a battle against the Phantom Tribe?&quot;
&quot;Nahato admitted they&#39;re not as strong as they used to be. They&#39;re certainly
not strong enough to take on the Alliance, or else they&#39;d be doing it
alone.&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; Diva sighed. &quot;You&#39;re right, Mr Jinnai. Forgive me for questioning
you, it&#39;s just that... I am concerned about the future of the Empire.&quot;
Jinnai looked long and hard at Diva. There was something different about
her, he was sure. He just couldn&#39;t put his finger on what it was.

&quot;Ow.&quot;
&quot;Oh, what now?&quot; Tenax frowned impatiently.
&quot;Well, if you must know,&quot; Amiri replied, &quot;this plaster cast you made is
crooked.&quot; She awkwardly held her broken left arm aloft.
&quot;It is not!&quot; Tenax insisted. &quot;It&#39;s completely flawless, not to mention
aesthetically pleasing. Your problem is that you&#39;re never satisfied.&quot;
Amiri continued unabated. &quot;It&#39;s digging in! Look! Look at that mark!&quot;
&quot;What mark?&quot; Tenax shook her head and smiled. &quot;You might be a great doctor,
but you&#39;re one lousy patient.&quot;
Amiri shrugged. &quot;Fair point. Most doctors are. Tenax, I&#39;m curious. Did you
ever study physics?&quot;
Tenax shuddered. &quot;Physics? Ugh. Just barely. Only the absolute minimum I
needed to get by in medicine. Why?&quot;
&quot;I was looking over some research.&quot; She gestured towards a heap of papers on
her desk. &quot;My husband was a physicist. These are some of his notes. I&#39;m
trying my best to understand them, but they&#39;re way out of my league.&quot;
&quot;Well, don&#39;t look at me,&quot; Tenax said. &quot;What are they about, anyway?&quot;
&quot;Nothing special,&quot; Amiri replied. &quot;But he spent so long working on it, I&#39;d
at least like to understand the basics.&quot;
&quot;You know who I bet would understand it?&quot; the student smiled. &quot;Makoto
Mizuhara. He&#39;s supposed to be a brilliant physicist.&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; Amiri nodded thoughtfully. &quot;I suppose I could pay him a visit when I
give the princess her checkup.&quot;
&quot;Great idea!&quot; Tenax grinned. &quot;I also heard he&#39;s really cute. Can I come?&quot;

Makoto entered the living room carrying two bags.
&quot;Hi, Ifurita,&quot; he called. &quot;I brought some... are you okay?&quot;
He quickly put the bags down and hurried over to where Ifurita was sitting.
She was perfectly still, and her expression was glazed and distant.
&quot;Ifurita?&quot; Makoto prompted. &quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot;
&quot;Stand by,&quot; she replied suddenly.
&quot;What?&quot;
Moments later, Ifurita returned from wherever it was she&#39;d been.
&quot;Makoto, I didn&#39;t mean to alarm you,&quot; she said apologetically. &quot;I was
performing a self diagnostic routine.&quot;
&quot;I didn&#39;t know you could do that,&quot; Makoto replied.
&quot;Initially I couldn&#39;t. My program forbade me to access most of my essential
systems. But since you deactivated the obedience circuit, I&#39;ve found that I
can perform checks on nearly all aspects of my program. With all of the
strange things that have been happening to me recently, I thought it might
be a good idea.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about that,&quot; Makoto said. &quot;Could it be that Qawoor
simply has an ability similar to mine? It&#39;s not beyond the realms of
possibility that she just somehow developed it naturally.&quot;
&quot;True,&quot; Ifurita nodded. &quot;But there is a clear difference between your
abilities. You can manipulate a wide variety of ancient artefacts, whilst
I&#39;ve observed that Qawoor only has an effect on one class of relic.&quot;
&quot;What class?&quot;
&quot;Weapons. Every object that&#39;s responded to her has either been a weapon, or
part of a weapon. Myself, Sakura, the Eye of God&#39;s sealing circuit... even
your prototype dimensional transporter contained elements from the Eye of
God.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s crazy,&quot; Makoto replied. &quot;Why would weapons respond to Qawoor, of all
people?&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Ifurita said. &quot;I&#39;m not much closer to working that out, even
after the self diagnostic.&quot;
&quot;Did you learn anything from it?&quot;
&quot;A little,&quot; she said. &quot;I replayed my sensor readings from Sakura&#39;s attack,
because I wanted to know what prevented me from firing on her. Eventually I
discovered that Sakura was transmitting a low frequency EM signature that
was scrambling my targeting systems.&quot;
&quot;I had no idea you were sensitive to radio waves.&quot;
&quot;But I&#39;m not. This is the odd thing. It appears that I was designed to be
sensitive to that particular EM signature. Not only that, but I&#39;ve now
discovered that I too emit a similar signature. Presumably, that&#39;s why
Sakura couldn&#39;t attack me.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s weird,&quot; Makoto said with a puzzled expression. &quot;Two Demon Gods,
specifically designed so that they can&#39;t attack each other. It doesn&#39;t make
sense.&quot;
&quot;I know,&quot; Ifurita replied. &quot;During the Holy Wars there were frequent battles
between Demon gods. I&#39;m afraid I have no adequate explanation.&quot;
&quot;What about Qawoor? Have you examined your sensor readings from your
encounters with her?&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; Ifurita sighed. &quot;But the results were confusing. My reactions to her
are routed through a block of programming that I still can&#39;t examine.&quot;
Makoto&#39;s brow furrowed. &quot;In theory you should be able to examine all of your
systems, now that the obedience circuit isn&#39;t there to stop you.&quot;
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; she theorised, &quot;there is a second obedience circuit holding me
back.&quot;
&quot;Could be,&quot; Makoto conceded. &quot;A really important system could be guarded by
a backup. But, if I deactivated one obedience circuit, I&#39;m pretty sure I can
deactivate another.&quot;

Anybody who has ever wondered how the media works will find the following
passage to be of particular interest. It begins with a highly competitive
group of newspapers who have an incredibly important story to report, but
very little to say about it.
The selection of a little-known regional priestess from Perallia to be the
next Alpha Priestess was big news indeed. The contest for the next head of
the Holy Order had been wide open, but Manserati Serati- for it was she-
wasn&#39;t even thought to be on the shortlist.
All of this was terribly exciting and newsworthy, but there was a problem.
Nobody really knew much about Serati, and what little they had managed to
find out was hardly gripping. They desperately needed what the business
refers to as an &#39;angle&#39;- which is newspaper code for a self-righteous
opinion on the subject in question. Unfortunately, Serati seemed so bland
that no one knew what to make of her.
Then Serati did something unexpected. She appointed Jennown Doht, newspaper
columnist and minor advisor to the Holy Order, as her senior consultant.
Doht was understandably very pleased about this, and had nothing but praise
for Serati in his column in the Roshtarian Sun. At long last, somebody had
expressed an opinion. The newspaper&#39;s editorial staff decided to go with it,
and the very next day, the Roshtarian Sun came out in support of Serati. The
other publications owned by the same media group quickly followed suit.
Their competitors considered disagreeing- after all, wasn&#39;t that what they
were meant to do? But since there was nothing obviously wrong with the new
Alpha Priestess, they decided to stick to what was fast becoming the popular
view.
And so, in a matter of days, every newspaper in the land was full of
pro-Serati editorials, as the phrases &#39;fresh start&#39; and &#39;safe pair of hands&#39;
became practically ubiquitous.
Curiously, in all of the excitement very few people noticed the apparent
incongruity of an uncontroversial figure like Serati employing the
hyper-opinionated Doht as a consultant. Fortunately though, there are always
certain people on whom nothing is lost.

Miz shook her head angrily, an action which had become something of a habit
in recent days. &quot;I can&#39;t believe the Alpha Priestess would want anything to
do with that despicable little man.&quot;
&quot;Oh well,&quot; Shayla shrugged. &quot;Who are we to question the almighty Alpha
Priestess?&quot;
&quot;Shayla?&quot; Miz looked at the fire priestess as if she&#39;d just recited all
three holy mantras backwards.
&quot;I was being sarcastic,&quot; Shayla assured her.
&quot;Good,&quot; Miz replied. &quot;For once, I think your cynicism could be very
valuable. This Serati has yet to convince me that she&#39;s real Alpha Priestess
material, and as for Doht...&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m confused,&quot; Qawoor said from across the table. &quot;I&#39;ve never known a man-
any man- be given such an important position in the Holy Order.&quot;
&quot;Historically, it&#39;s certainly not unprecedented,&quot; Afura replied. &quot;But you&#39;re
right, it&#39;s quite rare. What&#39;s more, all of the senior male appointees I can
recall were given their position because they were clearly far better than
any other candidate. That&#39;s not the case this time.&quot;
Shayla groaned. &quot;Well, it&#39;s sure as hell going to make our job more
difficult. Sooner or later, we&#39;ll have to give him the prophecy. Then what?&quot;
Nanami walked up to the table. &quot;Everything okay here?&quot;
Shayla, Afura and Miz nodded solemnly. Qawoor smiled gleefully.
&quot;Hi, Miss Nanami!&quot; she called, oblivious to the predominant mood.
&quot;Can I get you anything else?&quot; Nanami asked.
&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; Miz nodded. &quot;We&#39;ll have four more coffees, please.&quot;
&quot;Great!&quot; Nanami smiled. &quot;Mycea, there&#39;s...&quot;
She looked around for her assistant, finally locating her at one of the far
tables.
&quot;Aw, Mycea...&quot;
Nanami headed over to the table, where Mycea and Parnasse were staring
dreamily into each other&#39;s eyes.
&quot;Aren&#39;t you supposed to be working?&quot;
&quot;I am,&quot; Mycea replied without breaking off her stare. &quot;I&#39;m just... making
conversation.&quot;
&quot;You haven&#39;t said very much.&quot;
&quot;Hey, get off her case!&quot; Parnasse said, displaying an unexpected and frankly
comical defensive streak.
&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; Nanami sighed. &quot;Far be it from me to disrupt the path of true
love.&quot; She paused, than added- &quot;While you&#39;re staring at him, do you think
you could at least get him to buy something?&quot;

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t it be visible by now?&quot; Alielle asked as she sat up.
&quot;You&#39;ve only been pregnant for two and a half months,&quot; Amiri sighed in
response. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;ll be visible soon enough.&quot;
&quot;So? What&#39;s the verdict?&quot; Fatora asked expectantly.
&quot;She&#39;s fine, absolutely fine!&quot; Amiri said, exasperated. &quot;Honestly, I&#39;ve
never known two parents get so jumpy over a perfectly normal pregnancy.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s not completely normal,&quot; Tenax offered from across the room.
&quot;Physiologically, it&#39;s just like any other. Oh, and I think we can withdraw
the medication now.&quot;
&quot;But I like it...&quot; Alielle said, disappointed.
Fatora nodded. &quot;Yeah. Wouldn&#39;t it be better to keep it up for a little
longer, just to be safe?&quot;
&quot;No.&quot;
Princess Rune, accompanied by her guardian cat, ventured into the room.
&quot;Oh, excuse me. I&#39;m not interrupting, am I?&quot;
&quot;Not at all, princess,&quot; Amiri replied. &quot;I&#39;m pretty much finished here.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you again, doctor,&quot; Rune smiled. &quot;Although I don&#39;t
believe I&#39;ve met your colleague before.&quot;
For a second, Amiri wondered who Rune was talking about. &quot;Oh... you mean
Tenax. She&#39;s a student of mine. Very talented, but I prefer not to let her
handle things alone. She&#39;s easily distracted, you see...&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m not!&quot; Tenax insisted. &quot;I&#39;m always very professional and... hey, a
kitty!&quot; She approached Rune&#39;s cat. &quot;Hello, kitty. What&#39;s your name?&quot;
Rune leaned over to her sister and sister-in-law. &quot;Fatora, Alielle, later on
we need to discuss the Dorusian situation.&quot;
&quot;How&#39;s it looking?&quot; Fatora asked quietly.
&quot;Not promising, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; she sighed. &quot;It&#39;s taking all we&#39;ve got just to
maintain the most basic diplomatic ties.&quot;
&quot;Maybe I should talk to them,&quot; Alielle suggested. &quot;After all, I&#39;m still a
citizen of Dorusland. They might listen to me.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s a good idea, Alielle,&quot; Rune nodded in approval. &quot;Anyway, we can talk
about this later.&quot;
Fatora looked over to Amiri. &quot;Was there something else?&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; the doctor replied. &quot;I&#39;m looking for Makoto Mizuhara. Do you know
where he lives?&quot;
&quot;Not far from here,&quot; Fatora replied. &quot;I&#39;m warning you, though. If you&#39;re
planning on developing a pathetic crush on him, there&#39;s a queue half a mile
long.&quot;
&quot;I have no intention of doing that,&quot; Amiri assured. &quot;Although Tenax is
considering it.&quot;
&quot;Well, I can take you there,&quot; Alielle offered.

&quot;She&#39;s not well, is she?&quot; Amiri said as Alielle led her along the path, with
Tenax trailing behind.
&quot;You mean Princess Rune?&quot; Alielle sighed. &quot;I know. She still hasn&#39;t really
recovered from the attack. I&#39;m sure she would recover properly, if she&#39;d
only agree to take it easy...&quot;
&quot;Being a politician must be tough right now,&quot; Amiri commented.
&quot;Rune just doesn&#39;t know when to stop,&quot; Alielle continued. &quot;She insists on
handling everything personally.&quot;
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Amiri suggested, &quot;you and Fatora should take over some of her
duties. Just temporarily, until her condition improves.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ll mention it to Fatora. But it won&#39;t be easy persuading Rune to
delegate.&quot;
They stopped in front of a small house.
&quot;This is it,&quot; Alielle announced.

Alielle, Amiri and Tenax leaned cautiously through the doorway and surveyed
the strange scene inside.
Makoto and Ifurita were sitting opposite each other, holding hands and
locked in some sort of mutual trance.
&quot;What are they doing?&quot; Tenax whispered.
Alielle shrugged. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s how they have sex.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s disgusting,&quot; Amiri frowned.
&quot;Hey, they&#39;ve got to do it somehow. I never did find out how.&quot;
Amiri walked cautiously up to the pair. &quot;They&#39;re both displaying symptoms of
catatonia. Wouldn&#39;t you agree, Tenax?&quot;
Tenax, by this time, had her mind on more important matters.
&quot;Look!&quot; she said, spotting Ura asleep nearby. &quot;Another kitty!&quot;
Makoto and Ifurita snapped abruptly out of their trance.
&quot;Well,&quot; Makoto said, &quot;that was a waste of time. I couldn&#39;t even get
close...&quot;
&quot;Oh,&quot; Ifurita said, noticing Alielle, Amiri and Tenax. &quot;We weren&#39;t expecting
visitors.&quot;
&quot;I just came to see Mr Mizuhara,&quot; Amiri explained. &quot;I&#39;ve come across some
calculations which I think may interest you.&quot;
She reached into her bag and produced a bundle of notes the size of a
reasonably exhaustive encyclopaedia. Makoto took hold of them.
&quot;This has got to be... several years&#39; worth of research,&quot; he said, puzzled.
&quot;Oh, I should think so,&quot; Amiri replied. &quot;If you could look through it at
your leisure and give me your opinion, I&#39;d be very grateful.&quot;
&quot;Um... okay...&quot; Makoto said.
Amiri hurried back to the door. &quot;I really should be getting back to my
patients now. Do contact me if you find something interesting.&quot;
Before Makoto had the chance to respond, Amiri had left, with Alielle and
Tenax in tow.
Ifurita glanced at the calculations. &quot;What are they about?&quot;
&quot;I... don&#39;t know,&quot; Makoto replied, confused. &quot;I didn&#39;t get the chance to
ask.&quot;

King Fran stood upon the hastily erected stage in the centre of Dorusland&#39;s
capital city, Cosine. He looked apprehensively at the distinctly unimpressed
crowd. This was all part of a campaign to drum up national pride in the wake
of the country&#39;s withdrawal from the Alliance, but sadly there was little
national pride evident.
While the Roshtarians loved their monarchy with a dedication that bordered
on the ridiculous, even the most patriotic of Dorusians had a hard time
pretending they were proud of Fran. In the months since Alielle had been
made a princess, Fran&#39;s popularity had dropped even lower. Princess Alielle
was, the Dorusians liked to think, a sort of surrogate monarch. She was, at
least, Dorusian by birth; and a beautiful princess whose escapades graced
the newspapers on a daily basis was infinitely preferable to a bad-tempered
old bastard who&#39;d gambled away half of the national budget.
&quot;People of Dorusland,&quot; he began. &quot;Much has been said about the decision to
withdraw our proud nation from the Alliance. Many of you question the wisdom
of such an action. Let me assure you that we have taken the best option. It
was no longer sensible to remain in the Alliance while Roshtaria and
Styrenia carelessly opened their borders to potential Phantom Tribe
sympathisers. No, now that we stand alone, we are safer than we have ever
been!&quot;
The crowd suddenly went wild. Fran smiled to himself. That had been
surprisingly easy. He waited for the crowd to calm down before he continued.
They didn&#39;t.
And why were some of them running?
Come to think of it, it had got very dark all of a sudden.
Fran looked up and saw a Bugrom troop transport hovering above his head.
&quot;Oh, shit!&quot; he cursed. &quot;Why do things like this keep happening to me?&quot;
An amplified voice boomed out from the transport.
&quot;Greetings! This is Katsuhiko Jinnai speaking! In a few short moments, we&#39;ll
begin the invasion of your country. Prepare to sit back and watch a true
master of warfare at work! And now, I&#39;m proud to introduce this evening&#39;s
headline act... Miss Sakura Tamaro!&quot;
Fran became aware of a woman flying just in front of the transport.
&quot;Hello Dorusland!&quot; she called triumphantly. &quot;Are you ready?&quot;

Afura walked into her guest room in the palace, and knew almost immediately
that something was wrong.
Through the darkness, she thought she could make out a figure.
&quot;Is that you, Fatora?&quot; she ventured. &quot;I&#39;ve warned you about this before.&quot;
The figure didn&#39;t move.
&quot;If you don&#39;t come out this minute, I&#39;m going to break bones. Important
ones.&quot;
The figure stood up. To Afura&#39;s surprise, it was taller than Fatora. It
walked slowly towards her, a shaft of light from the window catching its
face.
Afura gasped. &quot;Doht?&quot;
&quot;Priestess Mann,&quot; he replied calmly. &quot;Please, forgive the intrusion.&quot;
&quot;What the hell are you doing in my bedroom? Don&#39;t you know I could have you
arrested?&quot;
Doht tried to look apologetic. &quot;If there was another way, I assure you...&quot;
&quot;What do you want?&quot;
&quot;Priestess, I have a dilemma. I would appreciate your guidance.&quot;
&quot;Okay...&quot; Afura said, sceptical as ever. &quot;Go ahead.&quot;
&quot;Well, some people I know did something terribly wrong, and technically it&#39;s
my duty to report them. But I suspect they did it for their own well
meaning, if misguided reasons.&quot;
&quot;Hmm...&quot; Afura pondered. &quot;Could you elaborate at all?&quot;
Doht&#39;s expression changed to one of extreme confidence. &quot;Certainly. &#39;The
inert Shadows will make a formidable enemy.&#39; Sound familiar?&quot;
Afura couldn&#39;t answer. She just stared.
Doht continued. &quot;You were ordered to divulge everything you had learnt about
the Heretic Prophecy. Unfortunately, you made the foolish decision to
withhold information.&quot;
&quot;What? How did you...&quot;
&quot;How did I find out? Simple. When all of you left Mizuhara&#39;s house to fight
the Demon God, I conducted a little search of the premises. I suspected you
might have been hiding something... and my instincts were correct.&quot;
Afura was shocked. &quot;You searched a private residence without permission?
That&#39;s illegal!&quot;
Doht&#39;s tone suddenly became aggressive. &quot;You disobeyed a direct command from
the Holy Order. You are in no position to lecture me. Now tell me, what made
you do it?&quot;
&quot;You want to know? Fine! It had nothing to do with the Holy order. It was
you. We didn&#39;t trust you with the information. We thought your politics
might cloud your judgement.&quot;
&quot;My politics are my own business!&quot; he snapped. &quot;I don&#39;t allow them to
interfere with my work. Did you really think you could keep this from me
forever?&quot;
Afura sighed. &quot;We wanted to translate the whole thing first. To be sure of
the context...&quot;
&quot;And if it still didn&#39;t meet with your approval?&quot; Doht challenged.
&quot;Unbelievable.&quot; He shook his head solemnly. &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s become of
the Muldoon priesthood.&quot;
&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot;
&quot;I remember back when it still had some dignity,&quot; he reminisced. &quot;Priestess
Mishtal. When she was ordained, that was the beginning of the end. I always
maintained she was too unpredictable, too self absorbed...&quot;
&quot;How dare you!&quot; Afura objected angrily.
Doht continued. &quot;Little did I expect that there was worse to come. Today&#39;s
priesthood is a joke! Whatever possessed Priestess Shayla to join the Holy
Order, I&#39;ll never know. She&#39;s more suited to the armed forces! And Priestess
Towles... is naive, foolish, and far too weak to lead the priesthood. This
latest incident only proves their inadequacy. By rights, I should have them
both reported and stripped of their titles.&quot;
&quot;Well? Who&#39;s stopping you?&quot;
&quot;As much as I disapprove of their actions, I&#39;m not the sort to derive
pleasure from the misfortune of others. I&#39;ll be prepared to overlook this
impropriety, on one condition. I want the Heretic Prophecy fully translated,
and I want it soon. Trust me, Priestess Mann. This prophecy is far, far more
important than it appears to be.&quot;
&quot;Meaning what?&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ll explain further when I have the translation,&quot; Doht said, heading for
the door. &quot;And I wouldn&#39;t mention this meeting to your colleagues if I were
you. The consequences could be... embarrassing.&quot;
&quot;Wait,&quot; Afura called. &quot;You were prepared to insult my friends, but what
about me? Aren&#39;t you brave enough to insult me to my face?&quot;
Doht smiled. &quot;On the contrary, I think you&#39;re a fine priestess. I only hope
the stupidity of your companions doesn&#39;t get you dragged down with them.&quot;
Doht strode out of the room, and Afura was alone.

The original intention had been to have a drunken night in, but Alielle was
pregnant and Fatora didn&#39;t drink anyway, so the only person actually
drinking was Mari. Her experience with alcohol was, however, quite limited.
&quot;That Fujisawa,&quot; she slurred. &quot;He&#39;s okay, I suppose...&quot;
&quot;Huh?&quot; Fatora responded. &quot;Just half an hour ago you said you hated him.&quot;
Mari blinked. &quot;Did I? Oh, well, in that case maybe I do. Sort of. It&#39;s not
his fault. He&#39;s from Earth. Everyone on Earth sucked. The only people I
didn&#39;t hate were musicians I&#39;d never met, and cartoon characters.&quot;
&quot;You mean like Hotaru?&quot; Alielle asked.
&quot;Yes! Exactly like Hotaru!&quot; Mari grinned. &quot;I love Hotaru. We have so much in
common, her and me. She looks just like me, you know. Except for the hair.
And we both heal people! Isn&#39;t that the coolest coincidence? And nobody
liked her. Well, apart from that little pink thing...&quot;
Fatora leaned over to Alielle.
&quot;Do you know what she&#39;s talking about?&quot;
&quot;Hey!&quot; Mari said. &quot;I just thought. The two of you are kind of like Haruka
and Michiru. Except you don&#39;t keep dying all the time. You&#39;d look great in
the outfits, though.&quot;
&quot;Fatora! Alielle!&quot; a voice called from outside the room.
&quot;What is it, Rune?&quot; Fatora called back.
&quot;Are you... busy?&quot;
&quot;We&#39;ve got our clothes on if that&#39;s what you mean.&quot;
Rune quickly entered the room.
&quot;Hi, Princess Rune!&quot; Mari smiled, then passed out.
Turning to Fatora and Alielle, Rune displayed a concerned expression.
&quot;Terrible news. It seems the Bugrom have attacked Dorusland.&quot;
Fatora drew Alielle closer to her. &quot;Is this a one-off attack, or something
more serious?&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s too early to tell at this stage,&quot; Rune replied. &quot;The details are still
coming in, but I&#39;ve called an emergency meeting of the defence council.&quot;
&quot;We&#39;ll join you,&quot; Alielle said immediately.

Day 168

Two weeks.

It had been two weeks since the Bugrom&#39;s devastating attack on Cosine. They
had fought with such relentless ferocity that Fran had expected the whole
nation of Dorusland to fall overnight. But suddenly, inexplicably, the
Bugrom had switched tactics. They were still advancing, but it was a slow,
methodical advance, which, according to his generals, was quite atypical of
Bugrom warfare. He had to take their word for it, of course. He&#39;d been away
on holiday during the last war, and rather wished he was on holiday now.
He sat uncomfortably in the war room of his new headquarters- a castle in
the far north of the country, as far away from the Bugrom advance as
possible. But despite the fact that the Bugrom now occupied more than a
third of Dorusland&#39;s total area, his generals were still optimistic.
&quot;As soon as the fourth and sixth armies are aligned across the Inner Valley,
we&#39;ll be in a position to start driving the Bugrom back into their own
territory.&quot;
Fran just nodded at the general. He understood very little of what was going
on.
&quot;We&#39;ve received a message from Roshtaria,&quot; another one said. &quot;Princess
Fatora is once again offering military assistance. Shall I decline?&quot;
&quot;Wait, let me think about this,&quot; Fran replied. Initially he had been dead
set against asking for outside assistance- he no longer trusted the
Alliance. But now, things were getting scary...
&quot;Maybe we should consider their offer,&quot; he suggested.
&quot;But your majesty, you said previously that...&quot;
&quot;I know, I know. But... well... it couldn&#39;t hurt, could it?&quot;
The general frowned slightly. &quot;Well, your majesty, reintegrating Allied
troops with our own forces could take days... plus, we&#39;re confident that we
can defeat the Bugrom without outside help.&quot;
&quot;You&#39;re... sure about that?&quot; Fran asked feebly. &quot;Very well. Decline.&quot;
The general nodded and walked away. Fran shuddered. He didn&#39;t really share
their confidence. He felt decidedly unsafe.
Fran wondered whatever had happened to the guardian cat that he&#39;d owned
briefly a few years ago. The last time he&#39;d seen it, it was going away to
&#39;contemplate its place in the universe.&#39; Psychologically unstable or not, he
wouldn&#39;t have minded its company right now.

&quot;Why is everything taking so long?&quot; Jinnai snarled. &quot;Two weeks and we still
haven&#39;t conquered one lousy country! What the hell&#39;s wrong?&quot;
Nahato smiled. &quot;Come now, Mr Jinnai. You&#39;ll burst a blood vessel.&quot;
&quot;You shut up, kid! I&#39;m sick of you and your smart-ass comments!&quot;
Refusing to be provoked, Nahato continued. &quot;I&#39;ve already explained that
you&#39;re significantly weaker than you were during your previous campaign.
Your troops are fewer in number, and Sakura still isn&#39;t capable of the large
scale destruction that was Ifurita&#39;s hallmark.&quot;
Jinnai looked to Diva, then back to Nahato. &quot;That&#39;s true. But we could still
advance more quickly than our current pace.&quot;
&quot;This war is going to take a while,&quot; Nahato explained. &quot;It&#39;s important to
crush any potential source of rebellion in your occupied lands before moving
on. Besides, if you were to go streaking through Dorusland at full speed,
the Alliance might panic and launch the Eye of God early. And it would be a
terrible shame if they fired it before we&#39;ve had the chance to neutralise
it...&quot; He turned to Diva. &quot;Don&#39;t you agree?&quot;
Diva said nothing, and walked out.
&quot;Damn, Jinnai sighed. &quot;What&#39;s got into her?&quot; He shook his head in despair.
&quot;Anyway, what&#39;s this plan you&#39;ve worked out for the Eye of God?&quot;
&quot;A plan elegant in its simplicity,&quot; Nahato replied. &quot;It will all be complete
in a few days from now.&quot;

Fatora paced around the war room, shouting instructions to generals and
directing the movement of pieces on the giant map of the Alliance below her.
There was no mistaking who was in charge today.
&quot;Get me that report on Bugrom troop numbers. Today, dammit! Forward my
recommendations to Stidiland and Gunan! Contact our tactical advisor, tell
him I want a meeting as soon as possible. Somebody get that cat off the big
map!&quot;
Fatora approached Alielle, who was studying the map carefully. &quot;I&#39;m not sure
what to make of this, Alielle. It&#39;s unlike any Bugrom advance I&#39;ve ever
seen.&quot;
Alielle nodded and looked back to the map. In particular she was looking at
an area in the north western corner of Dorusland, where her hometown was
located. In the last war, the Bugrom had bypassed it completely in their
race to reach Roshtaria. This time, it looked as if it wouldn&#39;t be so
fortunate.
Rune entered the room and appeared puzzled.
&quot;Fatora? What&#39;s going on?&quot;
&quot;Oh, this?&quot; Fatora gestured towards the scenes of activity behind her. &quot;I&#39;m
co-ordinating our new defensive strategy.&quot;
&quot;I didn&#39;t know...&quot;
&quot;Well, we didn&#39;t want to bother you,&quot; Fatora replied.
&quot;That&#39;s... very considerate,&quot; rune said. &quot;But you don&#39;t really have the
experience in these matters...&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ve never had the opportunity,&quot; Fatora smiled. &quot;Come on, don&#39;t you trust
your little sister to run the country for five minutes? I&#39;ve played war
games. I know what I&#39;m doing.&quot;
Londs strode over to the three princesses. &quot;Majesties, we have received a
response from King Fran.&quot;
&quot;He&#39;s accepted our help?&quot; Alielle asked hopefully.
&quot;No, I&#39;m afraid not,&quot; Londs sighed.
&quot;What?&quot; Fatora responded in disbelief. &quot;The moron! What the hell is he
thinking? He&#39;s gonna be crushed, can&#39;t he see that?&quot;
&quot;If he doesn&#39;t want our help, there&#39;s little we can do,&quot; Rune reasoned.
&quot;No,&quot; Fatora insisted. &quot;I won&#39;t accept it. There has to be a solution!&quot;

&quot;I came as soon as I could,&quot; Miz said as she entered Makoto&#39;s living room.
&quot;You have the full translation now?&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; Qawoor sighed.
&quot;Do I assume from everyone&#39;s faces that it&#39;s not good news?&quot;
Afura nodded. &quot;Correct.&quot;
Miz sat down opposite Shayla, Afura, Qawoor and Makoto. &quot;Well, you might as
well put me out of my misery. Let&#39;s hear it.&quot;
Qawoor began to read from the sheet in front of her.
&quot;Bear witness to the shape of things to come. When the time of the Holy
Apocalypse is past, the Shadow Nation will become two, and the inert Shadows
will make a formidable enemy. Though the land be strong, rebuilt after wars
ravages, it will fall. All shall be nothing, and nothing shall be all.
Before the end, there will be three signs. Two travellers will visit the
land. The fatherless child will be born. And the demon ally will fall upon
the touch of death. Then the land will be silent.&quot;
Miz looked thoughtful. &quot;Yes, I see. It does sound quite depressing. On
balance, I think I prefer the untranslated version.&quot;
&quot;We&#39;re assuming that the two travellers it mentions are Mari and Sakura,&quot;
said Shayla.
Miz nodded in approval. &quot;And the fatherless child... that must be a
reference to Fatora and Alielle&#39;s baby. What was the other one? The demon
ally...&quot;
&quot;Ifurita,&quot; Makoto said, distraught.
&quot;Oh, my...&quot; Miz replied. &quot;Does she know?&quot;
&quot;Of course,&quot; Ifurita walked into the room, looking rather more upbeat than
most people do when a prophecy has just foretold their demise.
&quot;You seem to be taking it quite well,&quot; Miz said cautiously.
Ifurita smiled. &quot;It doesn&#39;t bother me, because I don&#39;t believe in 
prophecies.&quot;
She paused. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry. I don&#39;t mean to offend your religious beliefs.&quot;
&quot;No, don&#39;t apologise,&quot; Qawoor said. &quot;So what now?&quot;
&quot;I suppose... we should inform the Holy Order,&quot; Afura said, her last
encounter with Doht still fresh in her mind.
&quot;Maybe we shouldn&#39;t be in such a hurry,&quot; Miz advised. &quot;The new Alpha
Priestess may seem harmless enough, but she&#39;s already appointed an extremist
as her closest advisor. I suggest we play for time until we know a little
more about her.&quot;

&quot;That concludes this month&#39;s agenda. Does anyone have anything to add?&quot;
Fujisawa stood up. He didn&#39;t usually attend governors&#39; meetings, preferring
to avoid the petty business of school politics altogether.
&quot;Ah, Mr Fujisawa,&quot; the chairman acknowledged. &quot;Please, do go ahead.&quot;
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Fujisawa said. &quot;I wanted to raise the subject of bullying in this
school.&quot;
&quot;Oh?&quot; A particularly elderly governor raised an eyebrow. &quot;I wasn&#39;t aware
that this school had a bullying problem.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m talking about a boy in the intake year, Cerev. He&#39;s been repeatedly
harassed by older boys, and...&quot;
The chairman cut in abruptly. &quot;Mr Fujisawa, an individual case like this is
hardly a matter for the board of governors.&quot;
&quot;This is a large scale problem,&quot; Fujisawa stated. &quot;A lot of pupils are
involved with this bullying.&quot;
&quot;This Cerev... he&#39;s the Opaque boy, isn&#39;t he?&quot; the ancient governor asked.
&quot;Mr Fujisawa, what do you expect? Boys will be boys, after all.&quot;
Another teacher stood up. &quot;Mr Chairman, I&#39;ve taught this boy, and I&#39;m not
sure the problem has anything to do with race. He doesn&#39;t make much effort
to mix with the other pupils.&quot;
&quot;Well, there&#39;s your problem,&quot; the chairman said.
Fujisawa was shocked to realise that the last time he&#39;d heard that argument,
it had been him that was using it.
&quot;Wait, wait!&quot; he insisted. &quot;This is wrong. Since when is it acceptable to
blame the victim?&quot;
&quot;I think this matter would be best discussed at a more appropriate time,&quot;
the chairman said hurriedly. &quot;Meeting adjourned.&quot;
People began to filter out of the hall. The chairman approached Fujisawa.
&quot;Please don&#39;t take this the wrong way, Mr Fujisawa, but I think you should
drop this matter.&quot;
&quot;What?&quot;
&quot;The decision to admit Cerev to this school was not a popular one. Many of
the governors are still opposed to it. If you really want to help this boy,
you&#39;ll do everything you can not to draw attention to him.&quot;

Makoto sat next to Ifurita in bed. He still couldn&#39;t take his mind off the
prophecy.
&quot;You really don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to come true?&quot;
&quot;Of course I don&#39;t,&quot; Ifurita replied. &quot;It was written thousands of years
ago. What evidence is there that it could come true?&quot;
&quot;The Holy Apocalypse came true,&quot; Makoto sighed. &quot;And a lot of this prophecy
seems to fit what&#39;s going on right now...&quot;
&quot;The Holy Apocalypse was only interpreted as having come true in hindsight.
Its meaning was altered to fit the events. Prophecies are too vague, Makoto.
If whoever wrote this prophecy wanted to foretell my death, why didn&#39;t they
just mention me by name?&quot;
Makoto nodded feebly. &quot;I know. It doesn&#39;t make sense. But I&#39;m... just so
afraid of losing you again.&quot;
&quot;Oh, Makoto,&quot; she smiled. &quot;The future is unpredictable. Any one of us could
die tomorrow. But that&#39;s not important. I&#39;ve lived for thousands of years,
and I&#39;ve learnt that one&#39;s lifespan is infinitely less important than the
quality of one&#39;s life. If I had had to choose between ten thousand years of
nothing, and the six months I&#39;ve spent with you, I know which one I&#39;d pick.&quot;
Makoto said nothing. He just rested his head on Ifurita&#39;s shoulder.
&quot;You&#39;ve already done so much for me,&quot; Ifurita said. &quot;Please don&#39;t worry on
my account.&quot;

Day 180

&quot;Seventy-six percent of Dorusland is now occupied,&quot; Fatora sighed as she and
Rune surveyed the map. &quot;I don&#39;t get it. Fran still won&#39;t accept help. I know
he doesn&#39;t like us... well, me, mostly... but isn&#39;t he taking this grudge
too far?&quot;
&quot;This must be difficult for Alielle,&quot; Rune observed. &quot;Watching as her
homeland is slowly conquered.&quot;
Fatora began to pace. &quot;I&#39;ve tried everything, sis. I even tried to contact
her family I thought I could arrange to get them brought to Roshtaria. But
there&#39;s a communications blackout, plus they&#39;ve closed their borders. It&#39;s
as if Fran wants the country to be conquered.&quot;
Rune shook her head. &quot;If only there was something we could do to stop the
advance.&quot;
&quot;Well, there is one option...&quot; Fatora hesitated. &quot;I&#39;m not keen on using the
Eye of God again, but we could unseal it... that might just put the Bugrom
off.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Rune replied. &quot;The Bugrom have good reason to fear the Eye.
We should consult with the priestesses straight away.&quot;

Shayla, Afura and Qawoor walked along the path leading to the Stairway to
the Sky. It seemed strange, Afura thought, that the Eye of God had remained
sealed and untouched for thousands of years; and now here they were,
preparing to unseal it for the second time in five years.
&quot;I wish we didn&#39;t have to do this,&quot; Qawoor said morosely.
&quot;Relax, it&#39;s not like they&#39;re actually going to use it,&quot; Shayla replied.
&quot;You heard Princess Rune. It&#39;s just a deterrent.&quot;
Afura sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to work.&quot;
&quot;Why not?&quot; Shayla asked.
&quot;The Bugrom know that the Alliance have the Eye of God. Just unsealing it
won&#39;t change a thing. It&#39;s a threat sealed or unsealed. But for some reason,
that doesn&#39;t seem to bother the Bugrom.&quot;
Shayla frowned. &quot;What are you saying, Afura?&quot;
&quot;It seems to me that the Bugrom aren&#39;t afraid of the Eye anymore. The fact
that they&#39;re advancing at all suggests they&#39;ve developed some way to defend
themselves against it.&quot;
&quot;But how could there possibly be any defence against the Eye?&quot; Qawoor asked.
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Shayla nodded. &quot;You&#39;ve seen it in action. Now, do you really think
the Bugrom are smart enough to create a defence strategy against the world&#39;s
most powerful weapon?&quot;
The three priestesses stepped inside the base of the Stairway, and
positioned themselves in the centre of the circular pattern that covered the
floor. The small pillars around them glowed with a brilliant white light,
and the floor began to rise up beneath them, elevating them up through the
Stairway&#39;s internal structure.

Amongst the crowd of people around the base of the Stairway, Parnasse stood,
staring solemnly at the great structure.
&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; Mycea chimed. &quot;Come on, Parny. Why don&#39;t you cheer up?&quot;
This annoyed Parnasse, since he felt he was perfectly entitled to be
depressed. But at the same time, he knew Mycea was only trying to lift his
spirits, so he did his best not to take it out on her.
&quot;I really hope this works,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;Somebody has to stop the
Bugrom. I don&#39;t want my country to be taken over.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m sure everything will work out,&quot; Mycea offered, trying to sound
reassuring.
&quot;Parnasse?&quot; a voice called from behind.
&quot;Oh, hi, Alielle,&quot; Parnasse nodded. &quot;This is Mycea, by the way.&quot;
&quot;Oh yes, your girlfriend,&quot; Alielle said, looking Mycea up and down.
&quot;Listen, Alielle!&quot; Parnasse hissed to his sister. &quot;Things are going really
well between me and Mycea right now, so I don&#39;t want you messing everything
up with your... weirdness, okay?&quot;
&quot;What weirdness? I can&#39;t imagine what you might be talking about.&quot;
&quot;Just stay away from her! Don&#39;t even think about trying anything.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; Alielle shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t find her that attractive, to be
honest.&quot;
Parnasse backed off. &quot;Well, in that case, I... hey! What do you MEAN, you
don&#39;t find her attractive? How DARE you!&quot;

The platform emerged into the light, and the princesses found themselves at
the summit of the Stairway. Silently, each walked to their designated area.
The three control units rose, in an oddly organic fashion, from the floor
beneath them. Shayla, Afura and Qawoor placed their hands on the smooth
black units, and began to synchronise the Eye&#39;s descent.

The crowds below watched with trepidation as the Eye of God moved slowly
nearer. Makoto, Ifurita and Nanami stood near the back. At the front,
Fatora, Alielle and Rune observed carefully. Miz, holding on to Mika, stood
with Fujisawa nearby. Parnasse and Mycea, Londs and Schtalubaugh- they all
watched.
Mari didn&#39;t watch. She&#39;d intended to but something had distracted her. Next
to her on the grass was a small bush, the flowers of which appeared to be
completely black. As everyone else watched the Ultimate Weapon as it bore
down upon them, Mari studied the flowers intensely. They were like... roses.
But black. She&#39;d never seen anything like them before.
Suddenly, it got dark. Mari looked up, and casually registered that the Eye
was eclipsing the sun. The lack of light was making it much more difficult
to discern the exact colour of the flowers. Were they really black, or just
a very dark shade of something else?
Then it began to rain. Lightning, thunder. Apparently, this was all part of
the unsealing process. It was all very distracting.
A flash of light, and suddenly it was all over. Everything was as it had
been, except that there was now a huge spherical weapon of mass destruction
hovering above the city. Mari went back to looking at the flowers.

Shayla and Qawoor walked away from their control units. The process was
tiring, although neither would actually admit to being tired.
Afura remained where she was. After a few moments, she looked back at the
others.
&quot;Something&#39;s wrong,&quot; she said.
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Qawoor asked.
&quot;The control units. Now that we&#39;ve finished, they should have retracted back
into the floor. I distinctly remember that happening last time.&quot;
Shayla shrugged. &quot;You sure? I really can&#39;t remember...&quot;
&quot;Shh!&quot; Afura interrupted. &quot;Do you hear that noise?&quot;
Qawoor nodded. &quot;I think so. Is it a sort of high-pitched whine?&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; Afura replied. &quot;I&#39;m not sure what it is, but I don&#39;t like it.&quot;
&quot;Hey,&quot; Shayla sighed. &quot;Don&#39;t be so jumpy. It&#39;s probably just the wind.&quot;
Afura frowned. &quot;I think I know what wind sounds like.&quot;
Shayla folded her arms. &quot;I was only trying to help. No need to be such a...&quot;
Suddenly, all three of them heard a noise like a clap of thunder, followed
by a pronounced shift in the floor. Just managing to keep her footing,
Qawoor called out-
&quot;What was that?&quot;
Shayla ran to the edge and looked down.
&quot;Shit! There&#39;s been an explosion, just a few metres below us.&quot;
&quot;How?&quot; Qawoor asked. &quot;Sister Afura?&quot;
Afura&#39;s expression remained unchanged. &quot;Sabotage,&quot; she said. &quot;Somebody&#39;s
trying to put the Stairway out of commission.&quot;
Another explosion was heard just below them.
&quot;Point taken,&quot; Shayla called. Now what do we do?&quot;
&quot;We get off this thing before it blows us up with it,&quot; Afura replied. &quot;Both
of you, grab onto me.&quot;

From the ground, it was obvious that all was not well. Although the apex of
the Stairway was too high up to be seen clearly, a number of tiny explosions
could just be made out at the tip. Consternation began to spread through the
crowd, and some people started to run for cover.

With Shayla already on her back, Afura looked across to Qawoor, who was
stood nervously at the far end of the shaking structure.
&quot;Qawoor!&quot; Afura called. &quot;Come on, we have to go!&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m coming!&quot; Qawoor called back. She walked unsteadily towards her
comrades.
An explosion ripped through the floor between them. Qawoor fell backwards
over the side, while the force sent Shayla and Afura in the opposite
direction. Shayla kept hold of Afura, who managed to stabilise their
descent, but neither could see Qawoor.

Qawoor was falling. She knew it, but somehow this was all such a shock that
she couldn&#39;t do anything about it. Under different circumstances, she would
have used her elemental powers to save herself. But, consumed and paralysed
by fear, all she could do was drop.

It suddenly occurred to her that she was no longer falling.
Somebody, also airborne, had caught her. She looked over her shoulder to see
Ifurita.
&quot;Ifurita,&quot; she gasped. &quot;Thank you.&quot;
Ifurita did not respond. She carefully deposited Qawoor on the ground and
immediately flew back up towards the Stairway.
Qawoor stumbled, disorientated, through the crowd, until she saw Shayla and
Afura.
&quot;Qawoor!&quot; Afura called out in relief. &quot;Thank goodness. We were worried you
might not have survived the fall.&quot;
&quot;Ifurita... saved me...&quot; Qawoor panted, exhausted.
Shayla and Afura looked at each other in confusion.
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Shayla said. &quot;I thought Ifurita was down here the whole
time.&quot;
Qawoor caught sight of Ifurita, standing with Makoto in the crowd.
&quot;There she is!&quot; Qawoor exclaimed, running towards her saviour. &quot;Miss
Ifurita, thank you!&quot;
&quot;What do you mean, Qawoor?&quot; Ifurita asked, puzzled.
&quot;You rescued me... didn&#39;t you?&quot;
Makoto shook his head. &quot;Ifurita was here with me.&quot;
&quot;But...&quot; Qawoor started, &quot;who caught me? I&#39;m certain it was Ifurita.&quot;
&quot;We&#39;ll see to that later,&quot; Afura said. &quot;Right now, the top of the Stairway
is still exploding. We&#39;ll need your water powers to...&quot;
&quot;Hey,&quot; Shayla interrupted. &quot;The explosions have stopped.&quot;
A figure landed in front of them. A figure identical to Ifurita.
&quot;I have extinguished the flames,&quot; she said. &quot;But the equipment on the
Stairway has been severely damaged.&quot;
Ifurita looked in surprise at the newcomer. &quot;Who are you?&quot;
&quot;My name is Ifurita,&quot; she said. &quot;Beta type, production number three. You are
the first Ifurita, am I correct?&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; Ifurita said. &quot;Makoto mentioned there were... copies.&quot;
&quot;Copy is not the correct word. Not exactly. We are not completely identical.
There are some fundamental modifications to my programming...&quot;
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Makoto interjected, &quot;but are you the same Ifurita we met at the
shrine a few years ago?&quot;
She nodded. &quot;I detected the presence of an unusual Demon God. Not Ifurita,
but a different class entirely. I came to investigate. It seems my arrival
was fortuitously timed.&quot;
&quot;Unusual Demon God...&quot; Makoto mused. &quot;You must mean Sakura.&quot;
&quot;What is her classification?&quot; the new Ifurita asked.
&quot;Classification? Um... didn&#39;t she say something about Absolute Zero?&quot; Makoto
recalled.
The second Ifurita gasped. &quot;Absolute Zero Class? It exists?&quot;
&quot;Yes, the Bugrom have it,&quot; Afura replied. &quot;Why?&quot;
&quot;The Absolute Zero Class is no ordinary Demon God. It is extremely dangerous
on a quite unique level. You are all in grave danger.&quot;

Jinnai and Diva stood on a balcony suspended high above the hive&#39;s base
level. Below them, a seemingly infinite number of Bugrom went about their
business with an unbreakable unity of purpose.
&quot;Diva, are you depressed or something?&quot; Jinnai probed. &quot;Because you&#39;re
acting strange.&quot;
&quot;I am simply concerned for the future of the Empire,&quot; she insisted.
&quot;Well, you needn&#39;t worry,&quot; Jinnai replied. &quot;Dorusland is almost ours.
Sakura&#39;s encountered no opposition. And the Phantom Tribe should be taking
care of the Eye of God.&quot;
&quot;Yes, the Phantom Tribe,&quot; Diva sighed. &quot;Mr Jinnai, you are the superior
military tactician. I trust your judgement above that of all others,
including myself. But I do not like having the Phantom Tribe here. It feels
wrong.&quot;
Groucho ran over to the pair, excited.
&quot;Kmrxsrhq plgnt!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Gbdrn xtrlv!&quot;
Jinnai&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Really? Incredible! So they can&#39;t use the Eye of God
now?&quot;
&quot;Rmnmkb,&quot; Groucho affirmed.
&quot;Amazing,&quot; Jinnai smiled. &quot;It&#39;s so simple. The Alliance need the Stairway to
control the Eye. So all we had to do was take out the Stairway. I knew we
could count on the Phantom Tribe!&quot;
Diva nodded to Groucho. &quot;You are dismissed.&quot;
As Groucho left, Diva smiled at Jinnai for he first time in weeks.
&quot;It seems our future is secure,&quot; she said. &quot;Without the Eye of God, the
Bugrom are unstoppable.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m glad you agree,&quot; Jinnai said.
&quot;Now that I am confident of the Empire&#39;s future,&quot; Diva began, &quot;I have an
announcement. When my last batch of eggs failed to develop, I became
suspicious... it now seems my suspicions were correct.&quot;
&quot;Suspicions about what?&quot; Jinnai asked.
For a moment, Diva seemed surprised that Jinnai didn&#39;t understand. So she
made it clearer.
&quot;I have reached the end of my life cycle. I am dying, Mr Jinnai.&quot;
Jinnai stared back at her. The polite thing would be to respond, but he
didn&#39;t know how.
How does one respond to something like that?
