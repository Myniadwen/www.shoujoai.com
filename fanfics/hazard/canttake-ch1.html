<h1>Can't Take Them Anywhere</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../hazard/index.html">El Hazard</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/songohan.html">Son Gohan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Fatora yawned, and leaned her head on one hand, looking at the 
traditional folk dancers of Celephais perform the intricate dances of 
their myth cycles. &#39;More damned dancers,&#39; she thought, &#39;don&#39;t they 
ever stop dancing here?&#39;

She ran her eyes over the other inhabitants of the dignitaries&#39; 
pavilion; as she figured, Rune was watching the dancers with polite 
boredom while even the native representatives were starting to doze 
off. An idea blossoming in her mind, she glanced back towards the 
guards; they, too, had been growing weary of this endless procession 
of culture events. &quot;Hmm..&quot; A wicked little smirk came to her lips, and 
she gently nudged forwards with her toe.

The violet-tressed young servant girl seated at the junior princess&#39;s 
feet started awake with a little cry of surprise. Turning her face up 
towards the princess, lower lip pooching out slightly, she said 
&quot;Fatorasama?&quot;

Fatora answered the pleading tone with a slight raise of an eyebrow 
and a slight increase in the width of her smirk. &quot;Alielle,&quot; she 
replied, giving a slight acknowledging nod.

Alielle&#39;s lips formed a silent O, and she turned her head slightly, 
raising an eyebrow herself.

Fatora nodded once, and flicked her eyes over towards the risers 
leading down from the pavilion.

Alielle returned the nod, breaking into an evil grin of her own, and 
rose to her feet to follow the princess as she began to walk with all 
due ceremony towards the side of the platform.

A minor irritation in the form of a guard confronted the pair as they 
made their stately way towards the exit. &quot;Can I ask where you&#39;re 
going, your highness?&quot; the officer said, accent thick but quite 
comprehensible. Dipping his hat and making a half-bow, he added, &quot;We 
don&#39;t want t&#39; be a trouble, we-&quot;

Fatora cut the man off, lifting her nose and declaring haughtily, &quot;If 
you truly -do- wish to know...&quot; She straightened herself upwards, 
making quite the production of looking down her nose at the man, &quot;I am 
fatigued, and wish to rest in my chambers.&quot;

The man glanced at Alielle and opened his mouth slightly, but a raised 
arm from the princess put a stop to that before it could get started. 
Then, as she marched imperiously past, Alielle tugged down an eyelid 
and poked her tongue out at the guard. As the pair left the grand 
hall, his shoulders slumped slightly. &quot;Don&#39;t we all,&quot; he muttered 
wearily. 

------------------------------------------------------------

The oaken doors to the royal guests&#39; bedchamber flew open with an 
ancient creak, and began to close as the pair made their way into the 
luxuriously appointed room. Fatora glanced around in disapproval of 
the spareness of the chambers furnishings, while Alielle hurried over 
to jump up onto the bed and kick off her sandals.

&quot;Hmmm,&quot; said the princess, stroking her chin with her fingertips and 
looking about with a neutral expression. &quot;This is such a pitiful 
little hovel, is it not, Alielle?&quot;

&quot;Uh-huhhhh,&quot; agreed the youthful concubine, rubbing one foot and 
stretching out her toes as she looked over at Fatora, waiting for a 
signal that she was certain would come.

Fatora folded one arm close to herself, and allowed herself a smug 
smile, before pointing over towards Alielle with the other. &quot;Then I 
suppose we&#39;ll have to brighten it up a bit, don&#39;t you think?&quot; She 
lifted her head slightly, giving Alielle a smouldering glance.

The response was a cheerful squeal from the purplehaired girl, as she 
undid the scarlet sash around her usual linen tunic. With a 
well-practiced flick of the arm, she threw it aside, leaning back on 
her hands and crossing her legs slowly, returning the glance with a 
coquettish wink.

Fatora&#39;s expression turned into a smug smirk as her companion 
performed quite satisfactorially, quite satisfactorally indeed. She 
walked leisurely over towards the bed, sitting down, kicking off her 
slippers and removing her cap, tossing it aside with another almost 
reflexive twist of the arm. Leaning back against the pillows provided 
for her comfort, she folded her hands behind her head and said, 
&quot;Attend to me, Alielle,&quot; with a relaxed sigh. Her legs spread apart 
underneath the embroidered robes.

Alielle dove down to the bedspread&#39;s sheets and began to move aside 
and upwards the ceremonious vestments, pink eyes shining with desire. 
Not speaking a word, she ducked her face down to slide along Fatora&#39;s 
thigh, feeling the faint brush of the downlike hair there with a 
lilting sigh of familiarity. Then she let out a pleased little squeak 
as she found the royal cleft to be uncovered, saving her an annoying 
ten second delay before she could partake in the luscious treat.

&quot;Mmmm!&quot; said Fatora as she felt the soft lips of Alielle brush against 
her cleft, toes curling and uncurling slightly as the pleasant tingles 
propagated through her body. Allowing her eyes to slide shut, she 
luxuriated in the sensation as the well-trained tongue began to slide 
along her. The nagging aching itch of desire started to flow into the 
warm flush of arousal, and the wet lappings of Alielle made the royal 
cleft begin to moisten. &quot;Are you enjoying your duties, Alielle?&quot; she 
asked, tone lilting and playful.

Alielle lifted her face from the royal peach and said, with a blissful 
sigh, &quot;Yes, Fatorasama..&quot; The steamy breath of the dutiful little minx 
made up for the momentary loss of her tongue, and she plunged back in 
with renewed effort, so Fatora had little to complain about.

With a warm chuckle, the princess said, &quot;You are skilful as always... 
mmh, a little higher, now..&quot; She turned her head and let out a sigh of 
her own, cheeks beginning to flush as she was tasted and bathed by the 
violet-tressed girl&#39;s tongue.

The tongue&#39;s lickings and teasings went higher, and began to slide 
between the outer lips as Alielle pressed her face closer to Fatora&#39;s 
cleft, inhaling the scent of sweat and arousal with a conoisseur&#39;s 
enjoyment. Deciding to be daring, she rested her lips around the warm 
fold of skin concealing the princess&#39;s nub, and suckled upon it 
lightly, eyes sliding shut in sensual enjoyment.

&quot;Oooh!&quot; Fatora bit her lower lip slightly at the abrupt tingle from 
her flesh, tensing slightly and then letting out a sigh. One hand slid 
from behind her head and went down to rest upon the loyally-attending 
servant girl, stroking her hair lazily as the royal libido was fed.

Alielle&#39;s cheeks blossomed a soft pink as her head was stroked, the 
natural arousal mingling agreeably with the flush of being praised for 
her service. Leaving the cleft of Fatora&#39;s sex for now, she continued 
suckling upon the warm fold of skin, her tongue slipping up to lick at 
the opening as she felt the small nub within begin to emerge.

Fatora&#39;s face tightened for a moment, mouth parting in a silent gasp, 
as the teasings continued along her tender nub, feeling with almost 
agonizing sensitivity each caress of Alielle&#39;s warm and moist mouth. 
&quot;Mmmh, gently, Alielle,&quot; she husked as she continued toying with the 
light purple hair, eyes closed in a reverie of pleasure.

&quot;Mmhmm,&quot; the smaller girl responded, snuggling in closer to Fatora&#39;s 
crotch as she let the tender and swollen nub be for a moment. Her pert 
nose sniffed lightly, inhaling the slightly changed bouquet of female 
arousal, the warmth against her face telling her the nearness of the 
princess to her climax; then, feeling the small sensitive nub of flesh 
against her upper lip, she captured it between both and sucked on it 
energetically.

&quot;Nnh!&quot; Fatora twitched slightly, lifting off her pillows and biting 
her lower lip again. A soft groan came from her lips as the wave of 
tension dissipated, inhaling raspily as the pleasant naughty tingles 
from Alielle&#39;s tending of her sex grew again. &quot;Very nice,&quot; she 
murmured, pressing the servant&#39;s head downwards slightly and closer to 
her, eyes squeezing shut. So close...

Alielle, well-attuned to her patron&#39;s cycles and nuances, slowed her 
lips&#39; stroking along the tiny bit of tender flesh. Taking a deep 
breath and feeling her heart flutter lightly at the steaming closeness 
of the air, she slid her lips apart and downwards.. her soft pink 
tongue running out to wrap around the tender nub. 

------------------------------------------------------------

The Celephaian ambassador nudged his aide slightly, and murmured, &quot;Did 
you hear something?&quot;

The bored and dozing aide snapped to attention at once, and leaned 
over closer to the elder statesman. &quot;Hear what, milord?&quot;

&quot;I could have sworn I heard some kind of cry. Are the falcons being 
sulky again, do you think?&quot;

The middle-aged civil servant nodded. &quot;Must be, milord.&quot;

Princess Rune wiped her forehead with a soft cloth, looking faintly 
pained. &#39;If only it was the falcons,&#39; she thought. &#39;At least they&#39;re 
being discreet. For them, at any rate.&#39; 

------------------------------------------------------------

Alielle lay on her side, licking her lips slightly and looking flushed 
and a bit weary, her soft skin slightly moist with sweat and the 
occasional trace of other, more intimate fluids.

Fatora, meanwhile, adjusted her robes and looked smugly at the servant 
girl, sweeping some of her long chestnut hair back from her face with 
a graceful motion of the arm. &quot;You were quite impressive, Alielle,&quot; 
she said, raising an eyebrow slightly. &quot;Quite impressive indeed..&quot;

The smaller girl blushed slightly, and beamed upwards. &quot;Thank you, 
Fatorasama.. you were delicious..&quot; She stifled a little giggle, 
quirking an eyebrow at the princess playfully.

Which evoked a soft regal chuckle. &quot;And you have excellent taste..&quot; 
She began to roll back one sleeve of the robes, deliberately looking 
at that instead of towards her loyal fellow-pervert.

Alielle oohed faintly, sitting up and clasping her hands to her chest, 
looking at the princess with an excited and anticipatory expression on 
her face. &quot;But you&#39;re the one who tasted excellent, Fatorasama!&quot;

They both had a moment&#39;s laughter at that, and then Fatora raised an 
eyebrow at Alielle, smirking lazily. &quot;I&#39;m feeling a bit hungry myself, 
Alielle. Why don&#39;t you tell me what you would have for me to eat?&quot;

Alielle giggled coyly and leaned back, reaching under her chest and 
cupping her breasts to lift up a bit. &quot;I have these,&quot; she said, 
running a fingertip over each nipple to make them stand out all the 
more and send a tingling shiver down her own spine. &quot;And this..&quot; She 
lifted her knees, legs spreading apart as she reached down to part the 
lips of her cleft, showing the princess the moist, pink flesh within.

Fatora&#39;s smirk grew into a lecherous grin as she was given Alielle&#39;s 
little show. &quot;Hmmm...&quot; She stroked her chin, looking up at the ceiling 
thoughtfully. &quot;I suppose that I&#39;d have to take...&quot; Her lips parted in 
a wicked grin, and she lunged at Alielle. &quot;THIS!&quot;

Alielle let out a squeal of delight as she fell backwards, Fatora 
pressing herself down on her and leaning her neck over to nibble at 
her earlobe. &quot;Ooo! Fatorasamaaa.. ooh, yes,&quot; she said, squirming in 
mock protest underneath the robes of her patron and partner in crime. 
The silk robe&#39;s brushing against her nipples brought on another 
squeal, this time lower and nearing a moan.

Chewing lightly on Alielle&#39;s ear, the princess murmured, &quot;I expect 
you&#39;ve gotten excited from performing your duties, Alielle, is that 
not so?&quot; She licked at the inside of the delicate earlobe and then 
began to run her tongue down along the line of the pinned concubine&#39;s 
jaw.

Gasping a bit, wriggling to get that silken feeling against her 
stiffening nipples, Alielle responded with an &quot;Ohh, yes..&quot; and spread 
her legs, Fatora&#39;s knee sliding between them as their rest point 
vanished.

&quot;Gotten hot and sticky?&quot; Fatora said playfully, growling faintly as 
she began to suckle at Alielle&#39;s neck, enjoying the warm skin and the 
faint scent of whatever perfumings the minx had performed on herself 
earlier in the day.

&quot;Yes...&quot; moaned Alielle, as Fatora&#39;s hand began to slide down her bare 
side, along the swelling curve of her breast for a moment, and then 
disappointing her and moving downwards towards the curve of her 
buttocks. &quot;I wanted to play with myself..&quot;

&quot;Ohh, how naughty of you!&quot; Fatora said with a little smirk, as she 
licked slowly along the curve of Alielle&#39;s collarbone. &quot;And you would 
have stained your tunic had I not told you to remove it, mmm?&quot;

Alielle groaned in agreement, nipples feeling aching and raw as 
Fatora&#39;s robes slid downwards. A soft purr came from her throat as the 
hand moving ever downwards cupped one of her buttocks for a moment, 
and then began to trace its way up and over her thigh.

Fatora paused as she neared the curve of Alielle&#39;s breast, moving her 
head over to one side to trail her lips down between the two warm 
hemispheres. &quot;Are your nipples tender, Alielle? Do you want me to 
soothe them?&quot; she said, with mock cruelty.

&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Alielle managed to gasp, feeling the hand slide downwards 
and trail through her cleft&#39;s upper thatching of hair, playing with 
the dark hair for a leisurely moment. Her thighs slid farther apart, 
sweat breaking out on her forehead as she felt herself getting 
desperate, panting lightly for breath.

Fatora granted the spoken wish of her partner, sliding her mouth up 
the soft skin of the warm breast to rest her lips on the nipple, 
glancing up at Alielle and raising an eyebrow smugly before she began, 
very gently, to suck on the flushed and stiff nipple.

Alielle met Fatora&#39;s gaze with near-helplessness, whimpering loudly as 
she felt the tingle of her nipple&#39;s satisfaction. Trying to lift her 
cleft upwards to meet Fatora&#39;s hand, she was thwarted when the hand 
slipped down and rested two fingers on her, one just on either side of 
her cleft; then, they started to tug the soft lips apart, very slowly.

Fatora&#39;s lips curved in a smirk as she felt Alielle writhe and suffer 
delightfully beneath her. Tugging lightly on the nipple, she let out a 
satisfied little murmur and slid down her tongue to run over the 
engorged nub, letting the concubine&#39;s cleft lips clasp together again, 
and starting to spread them anew after a moment&#39;s pause.

Alielle panted weakly, wriggling even more now, the sweat breaking out 
all over her silky skin, her own nub emerging from its hiding place as 
she was spread.. and then released.. and then spread again. 
&quot;Fatorasama...&quot; she groaned, looking at the princess pleadingly. 
&quot;Please...&quot;

Fatora smirked, lazily, and lifted her face from Alielle&#39;s teat with a 
wet sucking sound. &quot;Well,&quot; she said, straightening up and letting 
Alielle&#39;s cleft close itself anew, and placing her two fingers 
together and at its outermost limits. &quot;If you insist.&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;I am -terribly- sorry for this,&quot; Rune said weakly to the ambassadors 
as the Endless Dance began to twist and turn across the grand hall. 
&quot;She is.. that is to say..&quot;

The Celephaian and Kadathite ambassadors nodded, quietly, and the 
latter reached out to pat the poor woman upon her shoulder. &quot;We shall 
not hold your sister&#39;s behaviors against your nation, Princess.&quot;

Rune brightened slightly. &quot;You&#39;re very kind,&quot; she said with a slight 
smile.

From above the hall and off to one side, through an echoing airspace, 
came a distorted but lusty cry of &#39;HARDER! FATORASAMA!&#39; and then a 
happy squeal; the sixteenth thus far. Rune let out another sigh, and 
slumped in her chair: the negotiations would not be endangered, but 
that did not make things easier for her. She toyed with one bang, and 
glanced at it carefully. &#39;Oh look,&#39; she thought. &#39;Another grey hair.&#39;</pre>
