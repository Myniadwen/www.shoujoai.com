<body>
<p>We had stayed. We forgot about our dream   to see the other world; left it behind like a floating piece of dust that   drifted into nothingness.  <br />
</p>
<p>I hated her for months because of it. I   had so longed to feel the warmth of that light... the perfect Ri Majon that   would take us to the world we rightfully belonged to. Every cell in my body   cried out when she had said those words; yet I remained silent, questioning her   with my eyes, pleading noiselessly.  <br />
</p>
<p>But I knew immediately by her tone. I   knew her heart was responsible for these words. A fact I understood to mean that   she would not be swayed.   <br />
</p>
<p><em>“We will... stay Aaeru. We must to   protect our friends.” </em> <br />
</p>
<p>She had said them... just like that. I   could not believe it. But she knew that I would never leave her. She knew that I   could not. How cruel Neviril. How cruel of you to make me stay I thought. It   felt like my heart had turned black and all purpose had melted away. I was   nothing without my dream. I was nothing anymore.  <br />
</p>
<p>I locked myself in my quarters. I refused   to be seen by her. Ironically it reminded me of the time she had once refused to   come out of her room after she had lost Amuria. Before she partnered with me.   Before we had fallen in love.  <br />
</p>
<p>Everyone had tried to coax me out.   Neviril... Floe... Morinas... Rodoraemon... even Paraietta. Their words meant   nothing. I would not have budged if God himself had spoken them.       <br />
</p>
<p>I had remained numb for so long... I had   not known that what she had said through the door was good bye. It was not until   Waporif shouted her name... shouted that she had gone along with all of Chor   Tempest to protect the fallen city below from the Argentum forces that I   realized my idiocy.  <br />
</p>
<p>For the first time in a long time   adrenaline seemed to course through me and her un-noticed, disregarded  words   from before somehow became clear to me in my desperation to be with   her... <br />
</p>
<p><em>“I have no doubt that we will see the   light together one day my love. Good bye.” </em> <br />
</p>
<p><em>Good bye.  Oh, no. She   can’t...</em> <br />
</p>
<p>I threw open the door and seized Waporif   by his collar. <br />
</p>
<p>“Where? Where are they?” <br />
</p>
<p>“Not far. Several kilometers North East.   The Cantium plains on the outskirts of Palsinian country.” <br />
</p>
<p>“I need a Simoun! Now!” <br />
</p>
<p>His smirk was almost devilish.    <br />
</p>
<p>“I thought you’d never ask. I have one   ready for you on the deck.” <br />
</p>
<p>Boom!  <br />
</p>
<p>The Arcus Prima rocked back and forth as   if on violent sea.  <br />
</p>
<p>“What the hell was–  <br />
</p>
<p>BOOM! BOOM!  <br />
</p>
<p>The windows crashed inwards leaving glass   splintered everywhere. People could be seen emerging from rooms; some walking   cautiously and others scrambling madly to avoid the glass shards.    <br />
</p>
<p>“Are you alright?”  <br />
</p>
<p>I nodded and stood up to prove my   point. <br />
</p>
<p>“What are you thinking?” I asked at   Waporif’s nervous glance.  <br />
</p>
<p>“I’m thinking that we need to get going   or else we aren’t going to get a chance. Let’s go!” <br />
</p>
<p>I did not wait to respond as my feet   began to follow his command instinctively. No matter what happened I had to get   to a Simoun. I had to get to Neviril.    <br />
</p>
<p>We pushed past frantic staff members and   ran from corridor to corridor. More crashing sounds followed by deafening bangs.   Screams of outrage and fear rang out all around us as we fought our way through   and finally reached the hangar.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Halgif! Merbonf! Double check that   Simoun and ready it for flight!”  <br />
</p>
<p>“Yes Sir!”  <br />
</p>
<p>“Gareif! Kolgef! Assimilate the other   Simouns for stand by!”  <br />
</p>
<p>“Yes Sir!”  <br />
</p>
<p>“Waporif?”  <br />
</p>
<p>“Hm?” he grunted while evaluating the   nearest Simoun’s helical motor. <br />
</p>
<p>“What’s happening? I thought we had   Argentum held back at the perimeter?”  <br />
</p>
<p>“It certainly doesn’t look that way now.   We have to get you out of here. You need to help the others.”  <br />
</p>
<p>“But–  <br />
</p>
<p>“Sir, it’s clear. The Simoun on deck A is   ready for take off.” <br />
</p>
<p>“Good we’ll have to– AAERU   MOVE!” <br />
</p>
<p>I had caught a brief glimpse of it just   before it happened. Argentum had officially penetrated the Arcus Prima... and I   was face to face with a war ship that had undoubtedly caused much of the damage   we had managed to avoid earlier as we ran and ducked our way toward the hangar.    <br />
</p>
<p>But here it was. Staring at me like a   curious child who had finally caught its prey.  <br />
</p>
<p>BaAAROOOM! <br />
</p>
<p>More screams. I looked up from where I   lay and saw charred bodies and burnt vessels, nothing more than pieces of metal   debris left from a fierce missile assault. Bullets rang out like canon blasts   puncturing bodies, metal surfaces of equipment and left over Simoun carcasses   indifferently.  <br />
</p>
<p>“W-Wapofir,” I choked out.     <br />
</p>
<p>I turned my head painfully. My head was   bleeding and I am sure my leg had been sliced open but my only thoughts were on   Waporif. Where was he? He had pushed me out of the way. Surely he was okay too?    <br />
</p>
<p>It was then that I had spotted him; lying   near a piece of the Simoun that was to be mine. That no longer could be as it   was demolished beyond recognition.  <br />
</p>
<p>With my legs protesting furiously I   managed to pull myself up and maneuver through the wreckage to his side.    <br />
</p>
<p>“Are you... alright?” He whispered.    <br />
</p>
<p>I nodded. I had to get him up. We needed   to get out of here.  <br />
</p>
<p>“I’m going to get you up okay. We’re   going to get out of here.”  <br />
</p>
<p>He gestured needlessly to his lower body.   His legs were completely crushed, if not severed underneath the wrecked helical   motor of the Simoun.  <br />
</p>
<p>“That’s okay. We can still... We can   still get you out of here. We’ll just... I can try lifting– <br />
</p>
<p>He raised his hand to silence me. His   eyes were becoming pale. Every syllable seemed to cause him pain as he gasped   and choked; struggling to communicate.  </p>
<p>“There’s a... Simulator Simoun... over...   there. Take it... before they blow... this whole place up.” <br />
</p>
<p>“No! Waporif I can still get you out.   Just let me try!”   <br />
</p>
<p>And I put my back up against the motor   and put every ounce of strength into raising it. It might as well have been a   mountain. I tried again. And then again from a different position. Nothing   happened. <br />
</p>
<p>“PLEASE!” I cried out to any God who   would hear my plea as sweat now mingled with the blood dripping from my brow.   Still nothing. <br />
</p>
<p>“It’s... useless... losing time...   please... give this to... her.”  <br />
</p>
<p>His bloodied and shaking hand emerged   from inside of his uniform pocket, clutching something tightly. <br />
</p>
<p>The gold chain gleamed in the light   caused by the roaring flames surrounding most of the deck. Connected to it was a   locket barely larger than a finger nail.   <br />
</p>
<p>He let it slide from his grip and into my   awaiting hands.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Please... give this... to her... she’ll   want... she’ll... need it...” <br />
</p>
<p>My eyes burned as the tears leaked. He   smiled at me, his green eyes clouded, but warm all of the same. He nodded   reassuringly. I could not help but grab his lingering hand and squeeze it; I   guess hoping that it would somehow breathe life into him but fully knowing that   was simply more than an impossible notion.   <br />
</p>
<p>I closed my eyes briefly, reveling the   touch of his hand on mine. Then without looking, I let go and staggered away.    <br />
</p>
<p>I heard it distinctly... Even over the   sound of the bangs and raging flames... One whispered word as I walked away...    “Morinas.”  <br />
</p>
<p>I tucked the necklace around my own neck   and did not slow down.    <br />
</p>
<p>I had to get to that Simulator Simoun.   That was my only thought now. I had to make it somehow.  <br />
</p>
<p>Bullets still rained like hard snow   pelting down on the decks metal surface. I hid behind a nearby cockpit that had   been blown open and away from the rest of its essential components. I peaked   over and caught sight of the Simulator... miraculously   untouched. <br />
</p>
<p>I knew that reaching it was half of the   battle. The other and probably more important problem was the fact that without   a pair a simulator is unable to perform any Ri Majons and lacks any real   weaponry. It was designed strictly for practice flights for new recruits to   become familiar with the machinery and handling of a real Simoun. </p>
<p>I exhaled a deep breath and prepared   myself for the dash to the death trap I was counting on to get me to Neviril.    <br />
</p>
<p><em>Wait. They’re still firing too much in   that area. Wait... And... Go! </em>I shouted internally.   </p>
<p>I forgot that my leg was aching and   bleeding profusely. I even forgot within that moment that Waporif was dying only   yards away. I had to get to that damn Simulator so I ran as if none of these   things were true. I ran, twisting, ducking diving and rolling to avoid being cut   down by a rain of bullets. And before I could barely blink I was in the cock pit   and pulling away from the Arcus Prima.    <br />
</p>
<p>I had somehow done it and I did not have   time to contemplate how or why; just that it was done and now I had to find   Neviril. As I raced away into the open sky I was blasted off course by the huge   explosion that erupted behind me.  <br />
</p>
<p>My shock kept me momentarily incapable as   I watched my home burn and slowly plummet to the ground below, while I safely   drifted in the sky... my other true home; watching helplessly.         <br />
</p>
<p>The Arcus Prima was no   more... <br />
</p>
<p>I was not permitted a moment to mourn as   the Simulator was clipped by far away ammunition speeding towards and all around   me. A second of incomprehension and an overwhelming sense of loss had taken away   my ability to act. I watched in slow motion as lights barreled past, coming   closer with every second. It was better to just wait for the inevitable.    <br />
</p>
<p><em>“I have no doubt that we will see the   light together one day my love. Good bye.” </em> <br />
</p>
<p>Neviril... <br />
</p>
<p><em>“It was I who wanted to be around you.   I believe that I was attracted to your determined heart.”</em> <br />
</p>
<p>Her face... smiling,   happy... <br />
</p>
<p><em>“My life is nothing without you.” </em> <br />
</p>
<p>Her lips are soft...   complete... <br />
</p>
<p><em>“I love you   Aaeru.”</em> <br />
</p>
<p>Neviril. I will find Neviril...    <br />
</p>
<p>“NEVIRIL!” I scream with everything in me   as I drop altitude and dive with the effort of all that I had learned while at   the Arcus Prima.  <br />
</p>
<p>I was able to pitch roll and fly past the   Argentum patrol planes which were too slow to react and maneuver between a dozen   others holding position; surely awaiting to attack any surviving Simoun’s.    <br />
</p>
<p>They gave chase but even my Simulator was   too much for their crafts that lacked the power of the helical motors and I flew   away in a haze; speeding toward the place my locator had pin pointed Chor   Tempest to be.     <br />
</p>
<p>“I’m coming Neviril... Wait for me!”    <br />
</p>
<p>As I descended toward the Palsinian city   my heart nearly stopped beating at the sight that lie before me.    <br />
</p>
<p>People running in all directions; bodies   lying about without notice as others struggled to avoid being gunned down. The   city was nothing more than a fiery ruin.  <br />
</p>
<p>Argentum soldiers were already grounded   and calmly walking through the village streets firing at anything that moved   while several patrol planes continued firing at the escapees from above.    <br />
</p>
<p>Through the intense smoke and mob of   fleeing people I spotted a fallen Simoun, wrecked and smoking against a tree.    <br />
</p>
<p>“Neviril.”  <br />
</p>
<p>I shot down without a care coming to a   halt behind what was left of a motel. It was fairly well hidden and posted away   from the main streets. I peeked around the corner and caught sight of the Simoun   pinned against the tree. I could not make out if anyone was in the cockpit from   here, it was so badly smashed.  <br />
</p>
<p>I waited until a few soldiers had past by   and hurried toward the Simoun.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Please don’t! I don’t want to die!”    <br />
</p>
<p>“Floe? Floe it’s me. It’s me,   Aaeru.” <br />
</p>
<p>She had several gashes and scrapes on her   face and arms but otherwise seemed unharmed. My heart sank when I observed what   she was so desperately clutching onto. <br />
</p>
<p>“Alty,” I whisper.    <br />
</p>
<p>The right side of her face had been badly   burned along with her shoulder and upper arm. A piece of metal undoubtedly from   the cockpit controls was sticking out of her side; completely stained with her   blood. Her blue eyes stared without seeing.  <br />
</p>
<p>I knelt down beside Floe who was   supporting her and gently closed Alty’s vacant eyes. <br />
</p>
<p>“Floe... she’s gone. We have to move.”      <br />
</p>
<p>“She just needs help getting up that’s   all. Yeah– just a little help, right Alty? You can get up can’t you?   Let’s– <br />
</p>
<p>“Floe. Floe...” I tried cautiously.    <br />
</p>
<p>“I’ll put her weight on my side and you   can try holding her steady– <br />
</p>
<p>“She’s dead Floe and we’ll be next if you   don’t let her go.”  <br />
</p>
<p>The petite blonde seemed to finally   realize that I was actually there as she stared up at me disbelievingly; her lip   trembling.      <br />
</p>
<p>“I can’t leave her Aaeru.”    <br />
</p>
<p>“You won’t be,” I stated gently. “She’s   already gone Floe.”  <br />
</p>
<p>This statement apparently sobered her.   She gave one last lingering look over her partner and carefully lifted her up.   She lightly positioned her back on the ground that was stained with her blood   and kissed her forehead. <br />
</p>
<p>“Thank you for everything my dear   friend.” <br />
</p>
<p>“Let’s go Floe,” I softly persuade. She   gets up and joins me on the other side of the tree.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Damn! Floe lay on the ground and don’t   move! Now!”  <br />
</p>
<p>She looked shocked at the sudden change   in my tone but listened without question. I lay on top of her with my face   pressed against her back.     <br />
</p>
<p>A group of Argentum soldiers had come   across the fallen Simoun and were checking the area. I could feel Floe   shivering. I tried without words to communicate the importance of her staying   absolutely still.  <br />
</p>
<p>Then before I could even touch her I   overheard the gruff incoherent words of the soldiers. They were hovering over   us, laughing as they stared down at two seemingly dead priestesses. I could feel   one’s hot breath tickling my neck as he bent down to observe us more closely. My   heart was hammering against my chest.  <br />
</p>
<p>Suddenly a sharp laugh rang into the air,   followed by more nonsense dialect, then the soldiers had gone. We waited a few   minutes before daring to move in case they decided to return. Then when I felt   it was clear I sat up from Floe. She remained on her back staring up at the   leaves of the tree.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Let’s just stay Aaeru. It’s better this   way.”  <br />
</p>
<p><em>“We will... stay Aaeru. We must to   protect our friends.” </em></p>
<p>My anger at those damned words was enough   to propel me to my feet.  <br />
</p>
<p><em>“Stay... Aaeru.” </em> <br />
</p>
<p>“No. We’re going now get up!” I shouted   as I dragged Floe to her feet and slammed her against the tree. <br />
</p>
<p>“Aaeru?” she gasped.  <br />
</p>
<p>“You always do this. You always put our   happiness aside for everyone else. We were supposed to enter the other world   together but then you said we had to stay. You didn’t even ask me you just told   me. You killed my entire reason for being and then you... You left   me.” <br />
</p>
<p>“Aaeru,” she said calmly, “Aaeru... I am   not Neviril.”  <br />
</p>
<p>I had not realized that I had her roughly   pinned against the tree with fistfuls of her shirt in my grasp until I had   opened my eyes and saw her sad face staring up at me. Her hand was gently   covering mine, willing it to let go. Her eyes were sympathetic.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Floe... I-I’m sorry. I didn’t mean–I’m   so sorry.” She reached up and wiped away the tears I had not known that I had   shed in my tirade.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Aaeru. I liked you from the very start   because you never hide your feelings. I think that’s why you were able to help   Neviril find happiness again. She was only half of herself when you locked   yourself away like that. So don’t punish her for following her heart. Just as   she wouldn’t punish you for doing what’s right and following yours.”    <br />
</p>
<p>My head slid onto Floe’s shoulder and my   hands fell limply to the side. She was right.  <br />
</p>
<p>She pulled me into a hug and I rested   against her, letting the pain flow freely from me. What had I done? How could I   have been stupid enough to think that anything was more important than   protecting those whom we love?  <br />
</p>
<p>“The others,” I gasped finally after   another minute of letting myself cry. “We need to find them.” <br />
</p>
<p>Floe nodded. Never before had I seen her   embody such grace and courage. Perhaps my break down was enough to spur her on   but she wiped her own eyes and set them ahead determinately; searching the   landscape for any sign of life.  <br />
</p>
<p>“I lost sight of everyone once we entered   the perimeter just above the city. They had it all planned out I think...   Argentum. They ambushed the town and trapped us here when we came to help.”    <br />
</p>
<p>I crept behind her, mirroring her   position against the tree in hopes of catching sight of anything beside smoke   and debris.  <br />
</p>
<p>I did not have the heart to tell her   about the Arcus Prima. Not yet at least. I did not want to completely break her   spirit when she was clearly fighting so hard to remain poised... just as I was.    <br />
</p>
<p>“Well, we can’t see anything from here. I   say we head toward the main square by those buildings.”  <br />
</p>
<p>Floe hesitated for a moment and then   nodded.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re right. Let’s go!”    <br />
</p>
<p>We slowly made our way over to the area   that I had indicated. We stepped over the bodies of mother’s holding their   children; the remains of men singed and torn... some holding pitch forks and   other farm tools in a last attempt to protect their loved ones from the   inevitable.  <br />
</p>
<p>We managed to make it to a hut that had   not been completely blown apart. We ducked behind it and peered around the area.    <br />
</p>
<p>Floe’s sudden gasp and shaking finger   directed my gaze toward a patch of land occupied by several people.    <br />
</p>
<p>“Rodoraemon,” she   whispered. <br />
</p>
<p>Indeed Rodoraemon could be seen standing   with her arms spread out like a bird facing two soldiers with guns raised. It   was not until something behind her stirred that I understood the reason she was   standing as she was. <br />
</p>
<p>“Morinas.” <br />
</p>
<p>The silver haired woman was attempting to   stand but seemed unable as she slumped back to the ground clutching at her leg.   Rodoraemon was shielding her from them.  <br />
</p>
<p>I refused to sit back and watch this   unfold. I noticed another tree nearby the spot they occupied and without warning   to Floe, sprinted toward it. She soon understood my intention and followed after   me with surprising speed.  <br />
</p>
<p>Thankfully we made it to our destination   undetected by the soldiers.  <br />
</p>
<p>“What do we do Aaeru?”           <br />
</p>
<p>“We find a way to get their attention.” I   pulled my bow knife from the sheath on my hip. “Then it’s every man for   themself.”  <br />
</p>
<p>I was not worried for myself. I did not   want to do something so foolish as to jeopardize Floe’s safety.  <br />
</p>
<p>I watched with bated breath as the   soldiers laughed and jeered while pointing their weapons at Rodoraemon.    <br />
</p>
<p>“You distract them then I’ll attack from   behind. But stay near this tree for cover. You understand?”  <br />
</p>
<p>She nodded though her nervousness was   nearly tangible.  <br />
</p>
<p>“It might give you enough time to pull   Rodo and Morinas out of there.”  <br />
</p>
<p>“But– What about you?”  <br />
</p>
<p>“Just do as I say Floe. Okay?”     <br />
</p>
<p>She nodded reluctantly.  <br />
</p>
<p>“I won’t let you hurt her. Just take me   but leave her alone. Please,” Rodoraemon yelled aloud, daringly pleading with   the soldiers. <br />
</p>
<p>“Rodo... don’t– just get out of here!”    <br />
</p>
<p>For a moment, it seemed that her words   must have somehow affected the soldiers as they both lowered their weapons. They   exchanged words in their native language and stood still while staring at the   unarmed priestess. Then suddenly one lay down his weapon and slowly approached   her.  <br />
</p>
<p>He walked with his hands out in a gesture   of surrender. Rodoraemon did not move.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Rodo– please!” But she ignored her   partner’s desperate pleas. Now the soldier stood only mere feet from the   brunette. <br />
</p>
<p>“If you harm this girl, death will come   swiftly for both you and him,” she nodded toward the other soldier who had   remained behind.  <br />
</p>
<p>He answered with grunting dialect then a   shot rang out into the air. Rodoraemon was dead before she hit the ground.    <br />
</p>
<p>“RODO!” screamed Morinas.    <br />
</p>
<p>I hastily covered Floe’s mouth as she bit   back a scream that would have alerted the soldiers to our presence. We huddled   behind the tree as still as a blade of grass; Floe’s muffled  whimpering   tickling my hand while I did all in my power to control my breathing. I peeked   from behind the tree, hugging Floe to me for fear she would tear away   foolishly.   <br />
</p>
<p>“No! Rodo! RODORAEMON!”  <br />
</p>
<p>Her piercing screams were immediately   silenced by the blunt force of a fist connecting with her jaw. She crashed back   to the ground; sprawled out helplessly. The soldier who remained behind brought   down his gun, smoke still rising from the barrel as he sauntered toward his   comrade who was now standing over Morinas’s broken frame. They again exchanged   unintelligible words and laughed as the one nearing the fallen girl had stopped   to kick Rodo’s body out of the way.  <br />
</p>
<p>The soldier standing over Morinas had   curiously reached up and began pulling wires from his helmet. Then suddenly he   was free of his alien-like mask; coughing and sputtering. He was staring at   Morinas with the most greedy expression.  <br />
</p>
<p>I watched as he straddled her and began   to rip her clothes.  <br />
</p>
<p>“No! Stop!” But her pleas were again met   with a fist. Once... twice... three times until she was no longer responsive.   The man was using his knee to further spread her legs while his comrade watched   with a tinkling laugh.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Please...” she whispered, but the man   continued to wrench at the front of his uniform.  <br />
</p>
<p>I looked over at Floe, my hand still   covering her mouth; her watery eyes understanding as she nodded at me. I let her   go and she kneeled in a ready position at the edge of the tree. I slowly crawled   my way through the brush toward the three unawares.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Hey! Over here you   bastards!” <br />
</p>
<p>That was all I needed. <br />
</p>
<p>Both soldiers had looked up. I wasted no   time as I plunged my bow knife into the side of the standing soldier’s neck. He   lost control and began letting off rounds everywhere. Two found their way into   the back of his comrade while the rest hit the tree Floe had managed to dive   behind just in time.  <br />
</p>
<p>He tried helplessly to throw me from his   back but I simply clung to him with all of my strength causing both of us to   crash unceremoniously to the ground. I grunted in pain as his weight pressed me   into the ground. He squirmed and struggled using his hands to reach at the knife   still lodged in his neck, but to no avail. He seized making these awful gurgling   noises until he moved no more.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Aareu!” but Morinas’s attempted warning   had come too late. The man on top of her had pulled himself up; a hand gun   pointed directly at my heart.  <br />
</p>
<p>BLAM!  <br />
</p>
<p>I watched in amazement as he slumped over   dead. I turned around only to find Floe holding the assault rifle earlier   dropped by the man who now had a bullet in his head to join those that were   emptied into his back.  <br />
</p>
<p>She appeared stunned at what she had done   letting the gun drop from her grasp and staring disbelievingly at the soldier   who’s life she had just taken.  <br />
</p>
<p>I yanked the knife from the neck of the   other dead soldier and quickly knelt by Morinas.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Aaeru... you’re here.” <br />
</p>
<p>Her nose and mouth were bleeding as a   result of the soldier’s assault. I looked down and saw that her leg was twisted   at a weird angle.   <br />
</p>
<p>“I am Morinas. I am. Now we have to get   you out of here.”  <br />
</p>
<p>“Rodo– <br />
</p>
<p>“I know. She needs us to leave   okay?”         <br />
</p>
<p>“They killed her. She never hurt anybody   and... they killed her.”  <br />
</p>
<p>“Floe! Help me!” I had draped Morinas’   arm over my shoulder but would need help carrying her. <br />
</p>
<p>“Floe! I need you!” I shouted. I turned   as much as I possibly could with Morinas’ arm slung over my shoulder and looked   over at Floe.  <br />
</p>
<p>She was kneeling by Rodoraemon and   stroking her cheek, tears spilling fast from her eyes and onto Rodo’s pale   cheeks. She looked up at me with the same understanding look she had given me   before distracting the soldiers. She gently closed Rodoraemon’s eyes with her   fingertips, planted a delicate kiss on her forehead and proceeded to join me in   lifting Morinas into a standing position.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Morinas where are the other’s?” I ask as   we begin to make our way back toward the dilapidated hut we had used for shelter   before.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Vura and Kaim were... they’re dead,” she   finished coldly. “They were shot down in the air. There was nothing left of   their Simoun.”  <br />
</p>
<p>I was petrified to ask the very question   that plagued me since this had all began, but I had to know. <br />
</p>
<p>“Neviril...?”  <br />
</p>
<p>“She was with Paraietta. I’m honestly not   sure. I lost sight of them when we were hit and had to do an emergency landing.”    <br />
</p>
<p>Her tone was like ice; monotone and void   of feeling. She must still be in shock I thought. Rodoraemon’s face swam in my   mind briefly before I shook away the thoughts and returned to our current   reality.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Look, we need to get out of here. Where   is your Simoun?” She stared off into the distance. <br />
</p>
<p>“Morinas! Your Simoun; where?!”    <br />
</p>
<p>She slowly shook her head. “It’s not   going to fly... Too much damage.”  <br />
</p>
<p>This was slowly starting to look   impossible.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Okay, then. We need to find Neviril and   Paraietta. We have to see if their Simoun is still in tact. I have a Simulator   positioned toward the edge of the village. We can all escape if we have both, so   let’s get going.”  <br />
</p>
<p>As I had moved to stand up I was weighed   down by Morinas who did not attempt to stand; but rather pulled against me.      <br />
</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” <br />
</p>
<p>“I will not be responsible for anyone   else’s death. Just leave me. All I will do is slow you down and you know it.”    <br />
</p>
<p>“We won’t leave without you,” Floe chimed   in, her hand firmly gripping Morinas’ arm.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Just leave me– <br />
</p>
<p>“Forget it Morinas– <br />
</p>
<p>“DAMN IT! JUST LEAVE ME AAERU!”    <br />
</p>
<p>The slap was swift. Her cheek was marked   by an angry red imprint from my hand. I had heard enough. <br />
</p>
<p>“How dare you. How dare you waste   Rodoraemon’s sacrifice out of guilt. She died to protect you and you repay her   by whining like a child and refusing to fight... refusing to live. I’m sorry she   chose to save someone so pitiful and undeserving.”  <br />
</p>
<p>She had returned the sentiment with a   similar slap to my cheek; tears pouring from her brilliant eyes.    <br />
</p>
<p>“I loved Rodoraemon like a sister. It   should have been me.”  <br />
</p>
<p>“But it wasn’t,” I countered quietly, “so   pay her back by not wasting her sacrifice... live Morinas.”  <br />
</p>
<p>She observed me cautiously, tears gently   sliding down her cheeks. </p>
<p>“Fine Aaeru. Let’s find the others then.”   I smiled warmly. She returned it with a brief twitch of her lips and allowed   Floe and I to pull her to her feet.          <br />
</p>
<p>It had occurred to me that I could have   told them the truth about the Arcus Prima then... But with so much lost already;   I still could not bring myself to relinquish their last bit of   hope. <br />
</p>
<p>We marched like a three legged racing   team from one form of shelter to the next, praying all the while to remain   unseen and hoping beyond hope that we would find our dear friends.      <br />
</p>
<p>Neviril... <br />
</p>
<p>It was not until we made it to the middle   of the square that we saw the remnants of the once beautiful Simoun; a now   splintered and broken heap, laid to waste by the edge of a cluster of huts and   nearby foliage. It was difficult to see anything clearly from our current   position. There was still too much gun fire and explosive assaults happening   against the remaining towns people, obscuring our sight with random bursts of   light and smoke.  <br />
</p>
<p>I have to find Neviril... <br />
</p>
<p>“You two stay here while I check to see   if they’re there.” <br />
</p>
<p>“Aaeru you can’t go by yourself it’s   too– <br />
</p>
<p>“We have to find out if they’re there.   Besides that Simoun might be able to fly. We have to know don’t   we?” <br />
</p>
<p>“Well, yes but– <br />
</p>
<p>“Your leg is in bad shape. You can’t make   it across that open area with that kind of injury and I’ll be damned if I leave   you here all alone, so Floe is staying with you.”  <br />
</p>
<p>She shot me a defiant   glare. <br />
</p>
<p>“I’ll be back,” I hastened on. “We’ve got   to find out though. It’s the only way.”      </p>
<p>Her glare did not soften but she no   longer protested against my departure. I took her silence as a sign of approval   and immediately stood. <br />
</p>
<p>“Floe, stay here and keep each other   safe. I’ll be back before you know it.”  <br />
</p>
<p>She nodded obediently and huddled closer   to Morinas.  <br />
</p>
<p><em>Okay Aaeru. We have to get over to   that Simoun. We can’t afford to mess this up. </em> <br />
</p>
<p>My mind was racing as bullets and   explosions sounded all around me.  <br />
</p>
<p><em>She needs you. You have to find   Neviril.</em>  <br />
</p>
<p>And with that final thought, I ran as   fast as my legs would carry me. I flew behind another hut and waited until the   coast was as clear as it would possibly be under the circumstances. I looked   around the corner. The Simoun was only yards away. I could make it with one   final dash.  <br />
</p>
<p>I took out the necklace given to me by   Waporif.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Be with me on this one my friend,” I   stated somberly. I kissed the closed locket and put it back underneath my shirt.    <br />
</p>
<p><em>Go!</em></p>
<p>I charged toward the Simoun. I could see   several Argentum soldiers take aim at me as I rushed past. I dived behind the   air craft and quickly began to climb into the cockpit.  <br />
</p>
<p>“No.”  <br />
</p>
<p>Her hair was cascading into her face. The   top half of her long body sprawled over the edge of the opened cockpit.    <br />
</p>
<p>I grabbed underneath her arms and rolled   her over. Her eyes were empty. She had bullet wounds riddled across her entire   back from what I could see. There were no visible bullet holes in the Sagitta’s   seat of the cockpit... where Neviril was supposed to be. <br />
</p>
<p>It seemed that Paraietta’s final act had   been to protect Neviril.  <br />
</p>
<p>I climbed into the Sagitta’s seat to try   the engine’s. The controls on the dash board made uncharacteristic popping   noises as I flipped the necessary switches. They had apparently short circuited.   I slammed my fist down on the electrical pad in frustration. This Simoun was as   dead as its pilot. <br />
</p>
<p>Where the hell was Neviril? Had she been   ejected? Did she fall out somewhere before the Simoun landed? I had to get back   to the others. We needed a new plan to get out of here. I needed time I knew I   did not have to figure things out.  <br />
</p>
<p>I had to find her. I needed to find   Neviril.  <br />
</p>
<p>I climbed down from the air craft and   scampered back across the open plain. My determination to be with my friends, to   get them to safety, to find Neviril would not let me stop. Even the bullet that   pinched my calf and sent me flying did not deter me. I rolled my way over to the   edge of the hut where Floe emerged and pulled me to safety.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Aaeru! Are you alright? Where are you   hit?”  <br />
</p>
<p>“They got me in the leg.” At Floe’s panic   stricken look I continued, “It just scathed me though. I’ll be fine,” I   reassured her.   <br />
</p>
<p>She looked doubtful but did not question   further.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Did you see Neviril?” Morinas inquired.    <br />
</p>
<p>I shook my head. <br />
</p>
<p>“Paraietta?” <br />
</p>
<p>I nodded sadly. She seemed to gather my   cryptic meaning without need of explanation. Her eyes glazed over momentarily   before she continued.  <br />
</p>
<p>“What about the Simoun?”  <br />
</p>
<p>“It’s done for. We’ll have to get to the   Simulator that I came in.”  <br />
</p>
<p>She closed her eyes. The impossibility of   the task weighing down on us like a heavy stone. <br />
</p>
<p>“Oh God Aaeru. I don’t think we can make   it.”</p>
<p>   </p>
<p>I grabbed her shoulders and stared   directly into her soft eyes. <br />
</p>
<p>“Yes we can Morinas. There is no choice.” </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Floe, who had remained silent during the   exchange suddenly spoke.  <br />
</p>
<p>“They’ve already seen you Aaeru. Both of   you are hurt,” she took a moment to look at us both pointedly. “But we are   Priestesses aren’t we? Who says we can’t make miracles happen?”  <br />
</p>
<p>I looked over at Morinas who nodded in   return. <br />
</p>
<p>“Good. Now since I’m the only one who can   run I’ll act as the decoy.” <br />
</p>
<p>“No way Floe! I don’t   think– <br />
</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say we have no choice? Look,   we need to get there and the more you gripe the closer those scum are coming   with their guns blazing. You and Morinas can make your way over to that building   and then get to the– where did you say the Simulator was?” <br />
</p>
<p>“It’s at the edge of the village. The   lower west corner by an old motel that’s blown half to hell.”  <br />
</p>
<p>“Right. Well I can find that. Just get   there and I’ll meet you.”  <br />
</p>
<p>I eyed her carefully. That determined air   was back. There was no use in arguing with her. She could be just as stubborn as   me.  </p>
<p>“Be there in five.”  <br />
</p>
<p>“Make it four,” she replied. I laughed at   her presumption during such a time.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Okay. On my signal, cut and run that way   to that building. I’ll see you in a little bit.”  <br />
</p>
<p>“You know, I really like when she gets   all bossy and goes commander-style on us,” Morinas provided playfully.    <br />
</p>
<p>“Agreed. Are you ready?” <br />
</p>
<p>“No, but waiting isn’t going to help us.”   At the corner of the hut, Floe nodded her head and ran out into the open at full   speed. Bullets followed in her wake, chasing her; spraying against walls and   destroying everything they cut through. After several seconds, I gestured toward   Morinas. <br />
</p>
<p>“Go!”  <br />
</p>
<p>We hopped our way to the nearest   building. As we moved Morinas lost her balance. I scrambled to pull her to her   feet. When we finally managed to stay balanced and continue moving, a soldier   emerged unexpectedly from behind overgrown brush.  <br />
</p>
<p>I rammed into the back of Morinas and   caught the hit in the shoulder. She slid behind the building safely and I came   crawling after her; my belly collecting dust as I slithered like a snake to our   decided destination. The pain was excruciating but I did not have time to   concentrate on it; my mind was pre-occupied with Floe’s whereabouts.    <br />
</p>
<p>“Where the hell are you Floe?” I hissed.   Had she been killed? Why did I let her go? It should have been me, I thought. I   knew that I should have been the decoy. <br />
</p>
<p>“Aaeru, you’re bleeding pretty badly. We   need to at least slow it down. Here,” Morinas had set to tearing a piece of   material from her already torn uniform and began wrapping it tightly around my   upper arm.       <br />
</p>
<p>“Thanks,” I muttered when she had   finished.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Yeah,” she answered and leant against   the wall looking severely fatigued. I wondered how I must be looking if she   looked so haggard and drained. We waited for some time; seconds turning into   minutes that felt like life-times.   <br />
</p>
<p>Floe was surely dead... And so was   Neviril. Now I would lead Morinas to her death as well. We were sitting ducks   behind here with nothing but a knife and our pride to protect us.    <br />
</p>
<p>“Morinas.” <br />
</p>
<p>“Yes?” <br />
</p>
<p>“We’re not that far from the Simulator.   You could make it I bet if I drew their fire.”  <br />
</p>
<p>“W-what are you saying? What about Floe?”    <br />
</p>
<p>“She’s not coming. Neither is Neviril.”    <br />
</p>
<p>“Aaeru, you can’t say that.   They’re– <br />
</p>
<p>“Dead Morinas– And you’ll be too if you   don’t listen to me!”  <br />
</p>
<p>“I-I can’t Aaeru. I won’t go!”    <br />
</p>
<p>“Then you’ve sentenced us both to death,”   I stated harshly.  <br />
</p>
<p>She went pale upon hearing this   proclamation, all of the remaining color instantly draining from her face.    <br />
</p>
<p>I tuned into the cold feeling pressed   against my chest and realized that it was actually the gold locket from Waporif.   It felt cool and soothing on my over-heated skin.  <br />
</p>
<p><em>It’s not her fault. She didn’t ask for   this. None of us did...</em> <br />
</p>
<p>She sat with her head bowed, her hands   tangled in her silver hair. After keeping my gaze locked on her distraught form   for some time, I gradually scooted toward her and tentatively placed my arm   around her.  <br />
</p>
<p>At first she looked angry and quite ready   to push me away, but the apologetic squeeze I issued seemed to quell her anger;   and her eyes became noticeably warm, tears spilling silently. She then leant her   head on my uninjured shoulder and I stroked her hair. We were going to die here.   We knew it... All we could do is wait for them to come.  <br />
</p>
<p>I could hear the gun fire rattling the   walls of the small hut we were hiding behind. The bullets would continuously   rain down on us. The Argentum would never stop. They would never stop until we   were dead like the rest.  <br />
</p>
<p>Then in the distance I heard a loud, BANG   that sent debris and dust flying everywhere. There were anguished screams of   agony that permeated the air along with the cloud of dust that had arisen from   the explosion. I heard quickened foot steps echo purposely toward us. Morinas   gripped my shirt tighter, pulling me closer. I closed my eyes. This was it   Neviril... <br />
</p>
<p>“Miss me?”  <br />
</p>
<p>She was covered in dust and had acquired   fresh scratches and scrapes, but overall had refrained from receiving any   serious injury.   <br />
</p>
<p>“More than words could say,” I said, my   smile as bright as her blonde hair. “Thought you said four minutes?”    <br />
</p>
<p>“Give me a bit of a break will you. Even   I’m not as perfect as I may seem. Anyway, I had the idea that you guys might   have forgot me.” <br />
</p>
<p>“We could never do that Floe,” said   Morinas simply.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Right. Well, I spotted the Simulator.   It’s about twenty yards from here. The only way to get there is a straight shot   though.”  <br />
</p>
<p>I understood the meaning of ‘straight   shot’ to be a run in complete open air toward the damned thing. I shook my head.   It was suicide.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Floe, that’s not exactly close. We’ll be   lucky to– <br />
</p>
<p>“Please spare the lecture. I have this,”   she indicated the flash grenade clutched in her hand, “which might be the edge   we need.”  <br />
</p>
<p>“How did you– <br />
</p>
<p>“Slipped it from the belt of one of the   soldiers. He was dead so it was easy. The other one was an actual hand grenade.   It bought me enough time to come collect you guys so I’m not complaining.   They’re still disoriented so let’s not waste time. Come on!” <br />
</p>
<p>She was right once again. Most of the   soldiers had been blown off of their feet and were staggering to reorganize with   their fellows. I knew we could not waste this chance.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Go!”  <br />
</p>
<p>We clumsily staggered and tripped our way   around the many ruined huts and devastated building structures. Bodies and smoke   proved to be an obstacle to slow our course but by some miracle... perhaps a   Priestess one as suggested earlier by Floe, we had reached the area near the   Simulator. We ducked behind what was left of a stone fence, breathing deeply in   an attempt to catch our breath.  <br />
</p>
<p>I was extremely light headed. My eyes   felt heavy. My heart seemed ready to explode with every furious pump that it   executed. I knew that the others probably felt the same. I looked over at them,   panting and scared, longingly searching for some opening to get to the   Simulator. <br />
</p>
<p>They would escape. I would make sure of   it. I closed my eyes to concentrate on the next move.  <br />
</p>
<p><em>“Aaeru...” </em> <br />
</p>
<p>I could not have heard what I thought I   had. There was no way. And then it happened again. <br />
</p>
<p><em>“Aaeru...” </em></p>
<p>My name, whispered ever so softly by a   very familiar voice. But it was impossible. It could not be... <br />
</p>
<p>I frantically crawled over to the end of   the fence. I peered out into the distance, being careful not to stick my head   too far out so as not to attract enemy fire.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Neviril,” I breathed.  <br />
</p>
<p>She was hold up against the building   opposite the broken down motel harboring the Simulator. I could see right away   that she was injured. She seemed dazed as she sat with her back against the   wall, completely exposed to every and all Argentum soldiers who happened across   her path. <br />
</p>
<p>I do not know how I heard her. Frankly I   did not care. All I know is that she was there and she was alive and that I had   to get to her. I was foolish to have thought that she would leave without me.     <br />
</p>
<p>“Neviril’s over there!” I screamed at the   others. They slid over to where I lay and peeked around the   bend. <br />
</p>
<p>“Neviril! What the hell’s she doing?”   Asked Floe at the sight of her beloved Captain sitting with absolute abandon in   stark view of the enemy.  <br />
</p>
<p>“We have to get her before they spot   her,” said Morinas.  <br />
</p>
<p>As the two debated behind me, our eyes   met from afar. She had seen me. Through all of the smoke and haze she had   somehow found me; and in that moment, I could have sworn that I witnessed a   smile spread across her full lips.  <br />
</p>
<p>It was all that I needed from her. It   told me exactly what I had to do.  <br />
</p>
<p>I pulled the chain from around my neck   and held it out to Morinas. It instantly silenced her, causing Floe to stop   talking as well.  <br />
</p>
<p>“W-where did you get that?” she   whispered, tears beginning to swim in her eyes.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Wapofir and the others are dead. I’m   sorry. The Arcus Prima was destroyed.”  <br />
</p>
<p>“No. That’s not true– <br />
</p>
<p>Nothing can bring that thing down Aaeru.   You know that,” Floe exclaimed with an air of uncertainty despite her strong   words.  <br />
</p>
<p>I ignored their outbursts, willing them   to understand. They had to understand.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Waporif gave this to me to give to you   before he died. He said you would want it.”  <br />
</p>
<p>Morinas did not speak. Her hand shook   violently as she plucked the locket from my grasp and attempted to prize it   open. She finally managed to click the doors of the tiny golden locket   open. <br />
</p>
<p>Inside, was a picture of Waporif and her   smiling blissfully at the camera. They looked so happy together... as if they   had their whole lives to share moments like this one...  <br />
</p>
<p>Her resolve seemed to break at the sight   as she brought the opened locket to her chest and sobbed, clinging to it like a   life line. Floe who had been silently crying to herself, moved toward her friend   and gently placed her hand on her shoulder in a means of comfort.    <br />
</p>
<p>“The Simulator is right behind that   building... but it can only hold so much weight.” <br />
</p>
<p>Floe looked up. She appeared to have   understood something that momentarily sobered her from the pain and shock of so   much loss. <br />
</p>
<p>“What do you mean Aaeru?”    <br />
</p>
<p>“I need you to do me a favor Floe. Can   you do that?”  <br />
</p>
<p>What do you mean Aaeru?” She tried   again. <br />
</p>
<p>“Please, just listen.” <br />
</p>
<p>She nodded cautiously, not sure what she   could be agreeing to but nodding anyway... Undoubtedly out of respect if nothing   else.   <br />
</p>
<p>“I need you to throw that flash grenade   when I reach Neviril okay. Only when I reach her got it? Then you take Morinas   and get in the Simulator. Can you do that?”  <br />
</p>
<p>“What are you going to do?” I surveyed   her anxious face for a moment. She was always so honest, her innocent face never   failing to depict her truest feelings. I loved her for that. I cupped her face   in my hands and spoke. <br />
</p>
<p>“I’m going to get Neviril.” She reached   up and placed her calloused hands over my own.  <br />
</p>
<p>“And come back...?”  <br />
</p>
<p>I smiled at this admission. Boldly honest   as always. <br />
</p>
<p>“Of course.”  <br />
</p>
<p>She seemed to breathe a sigh of relief at   this and began to pull Morinas’s shaking form closer to her. It was the first   time I had ever lied to her. But the Simulator really could only hold the weight   of three people and still fly properly.    <br />
</p>
<p>“You have to make contact with Plumbum.   They’ll be ready to help.” Again, she nodded.  </p>
<p>I could hear the soldiers regrouping and   closing in on the area. Shots rang out into the air. I was running out of time.   I turned away from them and crawled to the edge of the wall to survey the scene   one last time.   <br />
</p>
<p>“Aaeru?”  <br />
</p>
<p>Morinas’s swollen gray eyes were piercing   mine.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Thank you.”  <br />
</p>
<p>I gave her the most characteristic smirk   I could muster and then shot out from behind the protective wall.    <br />
</p>
<p>It was not long before several soldiers   had spied me making my way to the fallen Priestess slumped against the wall.   This time I did not dive or slide my way there. I just ran straight   ahead... <br />
</p>
<p>The first bullet punctured my lower back.   The second hit somewhere along my shoulder blade, while the third pierced my   previously uninjured leg.    </p>
<p>Bullets clanged and bounced near my head   as I pulled myself along. I looked up. Neviril was so close, I could almost   reach out and touch her. As I slightly pushed myself up in an attempt to regain   my footing and trek the last few feet, I felt another sting sear my flesh, my   side exploding in pain.  <br />
</p>
<p>“AAERU!”  <br />
</p>
<p>I knew Floe’s voice. It seemed far away   now. I hit the ground unmoving. It was hard to breathe. I retched a bit as blood   rose and dribbled from my mouth as I struggled to inhale air. I vaguely   registered Floe’s scream again. It sounded muffled, quiet really.    <br />
</p>
<p>Neviril... <br />
</p>
<p>I had to get to her... <br />
</p>
<p>I dug my fingernails into the dirt and   with every ounce of my will power and what was left of my dangerously waning   strength, I dragged myself to her. I clawed at the ground like a wild animal,   pulling myself along like a rag doll. It was right when I knew my body would   give out completely, that I felt her soft fingertips graze mine. <br />
</p>
<p>I brought my head up to see her reaching   out to me.  <br />
</p>
<p>“I knew you were... here. I left... my   Simoun.... to find you. I just knew... you would... come for me.”    <br />
</p>
<p>Her front was drenched in blood from the   holes in her chest and stomach. Blood spilled copiously from her mouth. She was   barely tethering to life.  <br />
</p>
<p>“I... I am sorry... Neviril. I should   have– <br />
</p>
<p>But she silenced me with an understanding   look. She had linked our fingers together. I used my other hand to pull myself   up to her. She slowly leant against me, allowing her head to rest on my chest   which was now moving in a shallow rhythm. I pulled her into my arms and held her   close; sitting with my back pressed to the wall exactly as she had done moments   before.  <br />
</p>
<p>Suddenly everything was swallowed by an   intense light, so bright that I had to close my eyes. For a while I believed   that we had finally found the light that we had dreamed of for so long. But soon   the sound of screams and shouting could be heard and the light slowly   dissipated.  <br />
</p>
<p>I saw it in the distance. The Simulator   was air born and pulling away into the blue skies. The soldiers who had set   their sights on me had changed course and began to fire at the escaping    Simulator.  <br />
</p>
<p>I watched it hover and imagined that I   could see a pair of both gray and blue eyes helplessly pleading with me... then   it was gone.  <br />
</p>
<p>“They made it Neviril. They got away.   They’re going to be okay.” <br />
</p>
<p>Her silence automatically caused me to   look down.  <br />
</p>
<p>I was not altogether surprised to find   her eyes blank and unfocused. Her grip on my hand had slackened and she was no   longer breathing.        <br />
</p>
<p>The tears slid down my cheeks and landed   on her face like droplets of rain. I bent over her still frame and kissed her   perfect lips.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Wait for me... Wait for me in the   light...” I whispered as I nudged her nose with my own. I then slid my   fingertips over her eyes, gently closing the lids; shielding her from the fate I   was sure to encounter.    <br />
</p>
<p>It was quiet. My eyes were fighting to   stay opened. I had not noticed the soldiers surround me. One had even stepped   away from the pack and approached me.  <br />
</p>
<p>He was now only a few feet from me. He   was yelling something but I did not understand his gruff language. I saw him   raise a hand gun and point it directly at my head.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Soon, my love...”  <br />
</p>
<p>The soldier yelled again. Apparently he   was commanding me to do something. I only clung to Neviril more tightly.    <br />
</p>
<p>I smiled up at him.</p>
<p>“She was right, you know. The other   world... this was the other world we are destined to be in together. I   understand now.”  <br />
</p>
<p>The soldier was becoming increasingly   agitated as he stepped closer and waved the gun threateningly.  <br />
</p>
<p>I laughed... I laughed loudly at the   irony of my sudden comprehension. I laughed until I could no longer avoid   coughing up blood which now poured from my mouth. My laughter rang out in the   silence like a church bell which only seemed to intensify the soldier’s anger.   The last thing I saw was a quick burst of light... and then nothing.    <br />
</p>
<p>The light... It is so warm... It is...   Perfect...   <br />
  <br />
</p>
<p><strong><U>Epilogue</U></strong> <br />
  <br />
</p>
<p>The light shone off of the rippling water   like millions of brilliant diamonds competing to sparkle brighter than the rest.   It was always so breath taking; like a wavering dream. He knew that he wanted to   live here right away. But not just because of the view, or even the generous   soil for farming... <br />
</p>
<p>There in the distance, was the main   reason that he had decided to reside here on this deserted paradise; the thing   that had fallen from the sky at this very spot years ago... <br />
</p>
<p>“Daddy! Daddy!”  <br />
</p>
<p>He dropped his till and smiled at his   dark haired, green eyed daughter running precariously toward him, a gold chain   with a locket bouncing off of her chest with every step. His thoughts   immediately pulled away from the object that had briefly overtook his mind. She   leapt into his arms and squealed in delight as he spun her around before pulling   her up onto his shoulders.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Can we go today Daddy? Can we–Can we...?   Please..?” <br />
</p>
<p>Her small finger was pointing out into   the distance. He smiled at the thought that his daughter had grown to love that   place as much as he did. It had become something special to them both. For her,   a secret place of adventure and discovery. For him, a nostalgic place drenched   in memories past.  <br />
</p>
<p>“What did Mommy say?”  <br />
</p>
<p>Her silence was rather telling. He   couldn’t help smirking at the answer he knew was coming. <br />
</p>
<p>“Well, she’s making dinner and she said   we had to come help– But can’t we go after? Please–</p>
<p>Please– Pretty please?”  <br />
</p>
<p>“Maybe tomorrow Waporia. I promise,   okay?” <br />
</p>
<p>“Okay,” she drawled in a hurt tone. He   set down the disappointed tot and kneeled down in front of her. <br />
</p>
<p>“Now, now. Pick up that bottom lip before   someone trips over it,” he grazed his finger across the rose colored flesh to   make his point. She giggled in response, her stubborn air melting at her   father’s ministrations. <br />
</p>
<p>“We’ll go tomorrow.” <br />
</p>
<p>“Pinky swear?” She countered while   holding out her pinky finger hopefully. He laughed at his daughter’s quick   wittedness.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Pinky swear,” and they locked fingers.    <br />
</p>
<p>“Now go inside! It’s starting to get   cold. Tell Mom I’ll be just behind you.” She laughed and disappeared up the   hillside to the cottage awaiting at the top.   <br />
</p>
<p>He turned and looked out at the water   again. The sun was rapidly falling behind the mountains causing the sky to burn   with variations of violet and pink.  <br />
</p>
<p>To many, it was just a junk heap   cluttering up the beautiful lake; but to him it served as a consistent source of   comfort. It was a reminder of everything that he once was... A reminder of all   that he had lost.   <br />
</p>
<p>“Good night,” he called out to the sky,   hoping that his friends could hear his voice carry to what ever land they had   stolen to.     <br />
</p>
<p>“Coming in..?”  <br />
</p>
<p>He smiled at his wife, her stomach   swollen with child which was set to enter the world in several months time. He   walked over and lightly placed his hand over the mound, pressing his ear on top   in hopes of hearing or feeling something. <br />
</p>
<p>She feathered her fingers through his   short locks and smiled warmly. He was always so sweet with Waporia. She had no   doubt that he would be a good father to his own child.  <br />
</p>
<p>“I felt a kick. She’s going to be a   handful. I can tell.”  <br />
</p>
<p>“You mean like her   father.” <br />
</p>
<p>“You got me there,” he laughed and stood   to place his arm over her shoulder. She leant her head on his chest and together   they stared out at the water. <br />
</p>
<p>“Despite it being broken in pieces and   aged... It’s somehow still beautiful isn’t it?” </p>
<p>The blonde man sighed   heavily. <br />
</p>
<p>“Yeah, it really is.”   <br />
</p>
<p>“Floef?”  <br />
</p>
<p>“Yeah, Morinas?” <br />
</p>
<p>“I miss them. I miss them all of the   time. Some time so much, it feels like my heart is going to burst.” She followed   her words with a sniffle. He squeezed her shoulder in comfort. <br />
</p>
<p>“I know what you mean. It seems like so   long ago, but at the same time... it feels like it was only yesterday.”    <br />
</p>
<p>His mind drifted back to that fateful   day... the day that they had lost everything... <br />
  <br />
</p>
<p>–FLASHBACK– <br />
  <br />
</p>
<p>“Morinas, come on! I promised that I’d   get you to the Simulator. Please– Don’t give up now! I need you with me... I   need you.” <br />
</p>
<p>Her silver head slid back against the   wall. She stared up at the crying, yet determined blonde with her own red and   swollen eyes.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Please...” <br />
</p>
<p>Morinas could not let her   suffer. <br />
</p>
<p><em>“Live Morinas.” </em> <br />
</p>
<p>She would fulfill her promise   too... <br />
</p>
<p>She nodded and allowed Floe to pull her   to her feet and support her weight.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Okay, I’m going to throw this. As soon   as it hits, we go–Okay?” She nodded again to signify her   understanding. <br />
</p>
<p>“One–Two–Three.” The flash grenade went   up and landed in a single burst of intense light that caused many of the   soldiers to scream in pain. Floe and Morinas hastily fumbled and felt their way   to the Simulator. They managed to start up the motors and begin to hover before   the light completely vanished. Bullets pelted angrily against the air craft.   Smoke started to rise from one of the helical motors. <br />
</p>
<p>“Floe! We’re–We’re not going to make it!   They’ll shoot us down before we can reach Aaeru.” </p>
<p>Despite the smoking motor, they gained   enough height to see the wreckage below; enough to see their friends helplessly   cornered while soldiers surrounded the entire area. Floe understood   then... <br />
</p>
<p><em>“The Simulator is right behind that   building... but it can only hold so much weight.”</em> <br />
</p>
<p><em>“What do you mean Aaeru?” </em> <br />
</p>
<p><em>“I need you to do me a favor Floe. Can   you do that?” </em> <br />
</p>
<p><em>What do you mean   Aaeru?”</em> <br />
</p>
<p><em>“Please, just   listen.”</em> <br />
</p>
<p><em>“I need you to throw that flash   grenade when I reach Neviril okay. Only when I reach her got it? Then you take   Morinas and get in the Simulator. Can you do that?” </em> <br />
</p>
<p><em>“What are you going to   do?”</em> <br />
</p>
<p><em>“I’m going to get   Neviril.”</em> <br />
</p>
<p><em>“And come back...?” </em> <br />
</p>
<p><em>“Of course.” </em> <br />
</p>
<p>But deep down, if she was being   completely honest with herself, Floe had known at that very moment that Aaeru   had no intention of coming back. She had told her then without using the words.   Her eyes had given it away. But Floe, the naive and ever-persistent Floe, had in   fact been too stubborn to believe it.   <br />
</p>
<p><em>The Simulator is right behind that   building... but it can only hold so much weight.”</em> <br />
</p>
<p>She wanted to be with Neviril. She had   made her choice.  <br />
</p>
<p>“You liar Aaeru... you’re such a liar.”    <br />
</p>
<p>“What?” <br />
</p>
<p>“Let’s go Morinas!” <br />
</p>
<p>“W-what do you mean? What about Aaeru and   Neviril?”  <br />
</p>
<p>“We have to leave, okay?”    <br />
</p>
<p>“We can’t!”   <br />
</p>
<p>“Morinas! She wanted us to leave. She did   this so we could make it out. Please, let’s just go!” <br />
</p>
<p>Morinas seemed to be having an internal   struggle for she had fallen silent; all the while bullets clipped and chinked   away at the Simulator which was close to breaking down.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Morinas...?”  <br />
</p>
<p>“Okay... okay.”  <br />
</p>
<p>They ascended, swaying and jerking as   they made their way toward the heavens.  They halted when they were at a high   enough altitude to avoid being completely blown from the sky. The soldiers below   looked like ants swarming toward their catch as they scurried about the   Palsinian range. Floe and Morinas could just barely make out the dirty blonde   head propped against the building; supporting an unmoving fusia colored head   which lolled at her side.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Aaeru...” Floe   whispered. <br />
</p>
<p>A lone soldier had broken away from the   rest of the swarm. The sudden flash of light from the end of his gun had left   the blonde slumped over the body of her companion. They were now together in   death.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Floe... Please... Get me– Out of here– I   can’t– I can’t be here,” Morinas hiccupped through sobs.  <br />
</p>
<p>She obliged her friend, swinging the   controls forward and blasting off into the sky. That was the last they had ever   seen of their dearest friends and comrades: the battlefield that had claimed all   of their lives but for the two of them.  <br />
</p>
<p>They had managed to contact the Plumbum   administration as Aaeru had instructed. It was several weeks later that Morinas   had learned that she was pregnant. She had seriously contemplated terminating   the pregnancy; the pain of raising a fatherless child on her own... a child that   served as a daily reminder of that loss, seemed too daunting and scary a task to   follow through with. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Meanwhile Plumbum had united with several   other government factions to fight against the Argentum republic. It was several   months of bloodshed unlike any other before the Plumbum allegiance finally   prevailed over the enemy. It was then, that Morinas had decided to keep her   child.  <br />
</p>
<p>It was not long after that they both   visited the Spring to choose their official sex. Floe became Floef, and Morinas   stayed as a female to fully experience her pregnancy. <br />
</p>
<p>They remained close friends, and that   friendship eventually blossomed into an intimate relationship... <br />
</p>
<p>Floef smiled as his thoughts returned to   the woman he was holding at his side. He was fortunate to have met her and even   more fortunate to have her as a partner now. He loved her and Waporia with all   of his heart. How could he stay bitter or angry at the loss of his friend’s when   he had them here? His devoted and loving family... And another beautiful child   on the way.  <br />
</p>
<p>“I miss them too. But I think that   they’ll always be with us... Inside our hearts and minds forever, until we meet   again.”    </p>
<p>     </p>
<p>He could feel rather then see Morinas nod   her head in response, her sniffling subsiding.  <br />
</p>
<p>“I really love you   Floef.” <br />
</p>
<p>“And I you Morinas.” <br />
</p>
<p>They stood silently watching the sun set   as the shadows began to cover the dilapidated vessel from their past which was   breaching the water’s surface like an odd sea creature.   <br />
</p>
<p>“Shall we return to our girl before she   burns down the house?” <br />
</p>
<p>Morinas giggled. It reminded him so much   of the same little girl in question.  <br />
</p>
<p>“That side of her was definitely   learned.”  <br />
</p>
<p>Floef smiled warmly at this admission and   then stated simply, “Agreed.”     <br />
</p>
<p>“Aaeru.” <br />
</p>
<p>“Sorry?” he asked, puzzled by this sudden   outburst.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Aaeru. That’s what I want to name her:   Aaeru.... the highest form of love.”  <br />
</p>
<p>Floef shifted a bit to gaze into his   wife’s light gray eyes. <br />
</p>
<p>“Aaeru, huh?”  <br />
</p>
<p>The two took one last look at the once   grandiose Arcus Prima. After a rather lengthy pause, he elaborated on his   previous statement.  <br />
</p>
<p>“Yeah... Aaeru is absolutely perfect.”    <br />
</p>
<p>They then began the journey back up the   hill toward their home, hand in hand.  <br />
