<h1>Opening the Door</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../simoun/index.html">Simoun</a>

<pre>      The sky was the limit.  It was on old saying from a distant 
universe, but now it seemed like a fitting challenge for this moment.  
Limone and Dominula would break that limit and fly beyond the sky.  They 
would become the legendary Pair that performed Emerald Ri-Maajon to 
become part of Tempus Spatium, a legend that was spoken of in the 
present. 

      Although, Dominula and Limone wouldn&#39;t going to be the first.  
That honor belonged to Aer and Neviril.  Aer.  &quot;Divine love.&quot;  Both the 
girl and the concept were important to Limone.  The girl had helped 
Limone overcome her past mistakes and find the courage to keep flying.  
The concept was what she felt for Dominula and why they were going to 
create a perfect Emerald Ri-Maajon, the perfect prayer to the sky. 

      Limone and Dominula had successfully completed the Emerald 
Ri-Maajon once before, but this time it was going to be different.  
Their love was pure now.  They weren&#39;t going to just be thrown through 
time.  They were going to transcend time, just like the legendary Pair 
they would soon become. 

      They were halfway done with the Emerald Ri-Maajon.  Each curve was 
perfectly shaped with a dazzling glow.  Even the golden sparkles were 
brighter.  Everything in this &quot;prayer to the sky&quot; was more precise, more 
pure than their first Emerald Ri-Maajon.  Neither Dominula nor Limone 
had been there when Neviril and Aer had performed their Emerald 
Ri-Maajon, but as Limone and Dominula continued to pray, they knew they 
felt for each other what Aer and Neviril had felt for each other. 

      The Pair was now in the final stages of the Ri-Maajon.  The sky 
was clearer than a diamond, and the light from their prayer filled it.  
Everyone would know that Limone and Dominula had formed a pure Emerald 
Ri-Maajon and broken free from the limits of time.  Just like Aer and 
Neviril before them, the two who would pray with their divine love in a 
later time. 

      &quot;Dominula,&quot; Limone said.  Her voice was still soft, but had 
matured with confidence.  &quot;I love you.&quot; 

      &quot;I love you too, Limone,&quot; Dominula replied.  &quot;You&#39;re the only one 
I can do this with. 

      Once those words had been spoken, Dominula&#39;s and Limone&#39;s Emerald 
Ri-Maajon was finished.  Its light became brighter, and its beauty was 
beyond anything human eyes could comprehend.  Only the highest from of 
love, the love Limone and Dominula felt for each other, could create 
such a gorgeous sight. 

      And because of that love, the door to a new world was revealed to 
them.  The sky had opened up.  They were now free of this limited world.  
Aer and Neviril were waiting for them on the other side.  The Simoun was 
a key to open the gate to the new world, and Limone&#39;s and Dominula&#39;s 
love was the hand that turned the key. 

      Now, like Neviril and Aer before them, they existed outside of 
time, as part of Tempus Spatium.  They now could travel through space 
and time forever, always together. 

      Limone wrapped her arms around Dominula&#39;s shoulders as the older 
woman&#39;s arms came about the younger woman&#39;s back.  They shared a kiss, 
and once again they were in their Simoun, flying through the skies. </pre>
