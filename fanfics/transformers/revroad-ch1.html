<h1>Revenge Road (part 1 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../transformers/index.html">Transformers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Starscream cursed as the sleek fighter raced across
the sky, desperately trying to get ahead of his
pursuers. As the product of Cybertronian technology
this should have been easy, but impossibly the wing of
four fighters were keeping pace with him.

&quot;How is this possible?&quot; Starscream asked himself, the
metallic voice echoing in his cockpit. Seeing no other
choice he banked left, arching around to face his
pursuers. Twin lasers pulsed, blasting at them but
with remarkable agility the fighters scattered,
dodging.

&#39;Things were going so well, too,&#39; Starscream thought
bitterly. A human collaborator had contacted him
secretly, offering new technology to use against
Megatron, and so he had ventured out to this waste to
obtain it. &#39;Right into a trap,&#39; he added bitterly.

The fighters bobbed and weaved across the blue,
streams of tracer fire aching dangerously close to his
wings, some kind of high density projectiles.
Starscream returned fire, but they were like ghosts,
far faster and maneuverable than any human fighter he
had faced, possibly even a match for his old friend
Skyfire.

&#39;The Autobots,&#39; Starscream thought to himself
furiously, &#39;they did this, gave our technology to
these Micronian worms...&#39;

With a thought Starscream transformed, modular
segments of his body shifting around to take on his
robot mode. The humanoid robot body gave him full
access to his weapons and allowing him to hover and
easily pick the enemy force off. He brought his arms
up, the slim cannons mounted on each ready then froze
in shock at what he saw.

&quot;No,&quot; was all Starscream could manage.

The cockpit and nose cone of the human fighter shifted
downward as the central body slid apart, segments
moving to predetermined places. The powerful rocket
engines pointed down from each foot, the humanoid
figure cradling a heavy looking rifle aimed directly
at Starscream, the other three fighters following
suit.

&quot;This is Izzy Randal of the Robotech Defense force,&quot;
the voice came over a Decepticon frequency, &quot;normally
I&#39;d offer you the chance to surrender or die.&quot;

&#39;We can communicate,&#39; Starscream thought wildly as the
human piloted robots moved to bracket him, &#39;I can
bargain with them, maybe get out of....&#39;

&quot;But today we&#39;re not taking prisoners,&quot; Izzy finished
coldly as all four of them opened fire, high density
projectiles tearing through alien armor.

********************

The four fighters gracefully landed on the deserted
airfield, once the home to some of the United States
darkest black projects. Now it was home to a
initiative prompted by desperate necessity, a project
looking for a way for humanity to enter into a war for
their very survival.

The cockpit of the lead fighter, a sleek craft edged
in green, popped open as a young woman climbed out,
her lieutenant&#39;s bars still shiny on her collar. She
walked to the woman standing on the edge of the field
and saluted, &quot;Commander Hayes.&quot;

Lisa Hayes returned the salute, her long brown hair
flowing over her uniform. &quot;Welcome back Izzy,&quot; she
said, &quot;how did it go?&quot;

&quot;Scratch one Decepticon,&quot; Izzy flashed a dangerous
smile, taking off her curved helm, the visor clipped
back. &quot;He&#39;s flaming wreckage over Nevada,&quot; she
finished, her own dark red hair falling into her eyes.

&quot;The Admiral will be glad to hear that,&quot; Lisa said as
the fighters were rolled into the hangers, powerful
motors lowering the specially built bunkers into the
earth itself. She lead the way through a rocky
outcropping, disguising the elevator down as she
continued, &quot;I think Dr. Lang would have liked another
subject, but....&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Izzy said, though she didn&#39;t sound too
repentant.

&quot;I&#39;m just glad we didn&#39;t lose any pilots,&quot; Lisa noted,
swiping a card to grant them access to the highest
security areas of the base. There was a soft thump
when they hit bottom, the doors opening to reveal the
research center at Area 51.

A partially reassembled Decepticon fighter hung in a
latticework of cables and supports, scientists
crawling over it as they studied the technology, the
robot&#39;s heavy guns laying on the floor beside it.
Components were scattered about, diagrams of various
devices pegged up around the work area as they strode
by.

&quot;It still unnerves me, seeing Skywarp hanging there,&quot;
Izzy conceded quietly.

&quot;I suppose we&#39;re lucky to have him at all,&quot; Lisa noted
as they walked up a set of metal stairs, &quot;if a
recovery team hadn&#39;t found him or if the Autobots
hadn&#39;t managed to clip him earlier, we&#39;d still be just
spinning our wheels.&quot;

They passed a tall, blonde haired officer, a
lieutenant senior grade. &quot;Well done,&quot; Roy Fokker
murmured, &quot;the rumors are already flying.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Izzy paused long enough to give him a
grin, &quot;you&#39;ll be getting your chance to get the
Transformers soon enough.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re just lucky they drew your name out of the
volunteer hat first,&quot; a grinning Roy shot back as the
dashing blonde moved on.

&quot;You don&#39;t want to keep him waiting,&quot; Hayes put a bit
of bite into her words and Izzy sheepishly jumped to
it.

&quot;Sorry, ma&#39;am,&quot; she said respectfully as they reached
a door with a guard stationed outside. Izzy and Lisa
were ushered through quickly, soon standing in front
of a battered desk and the gray haired man behind it.

Henry Gloval was almost a legend, one of the last
submarine commanders before the arrival of
Transformers changed everything. His cap shaded his
eyes, the uniform he wore over his slim but muscular
body suiting him well. In his forties Gloval was the
old man of the division, but he easily commanded the
respect of his people.

&quot;Lieutenant junior grade. Izzy Randal, reporting,&quot; she
said, throwing a crisp salute, back straight and her
uniform neat.

&quot;At ease,&quot; Gloval rumbled. He studied her thoughtfully
before continuing, &quot;Congratulations, Lieutenant, on a
successful mission.&quot;

Izzy let herself relax just a bit. &quot;I hope Dr. Lang
and his team can get useful data out of our flight
recorders,&quot; she said, &quot;and compare our performance
against Starscream&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure Lang is jumping for joy,&quot; Gloval murmured.

Lisa Hayes had moved to one side, taking a seat nearby
one of two data terminals. As she was logging on she
looked up at Izzy, &quot;I wanted to get your impressions
of flying one of the new Valkyries, the other pilots
are also being debriefed now.&quot;

&quot;Impressions, right,&quot; Izzy took a breath. Quietly she
ran through details of the launch, the practice
maneuvers out over the desert then the confrontation
with Starscream, touching on the control responses,
maneuverability and other issues.

&quot;Very nice,&quot; Gloval nodded. He looked at her
thoughtfully a few moments, &quot;Production of the VF-1A,
our production model, will be beginning soon. Would
you object to being assigned to other units to assist
in training as we deploy them?&quot;

Izzy felt a flash of eagerness, &quot;As long as I get to
keep shooting down Transformers, sir.&quot;

&quot;I notice you don&#39;t say Decepticons,&quot; Lisa said
mildly, &quot;you know that the Autobots are considered our
allies, Lieutenant.&quot;

Izzy clenched her jaw slightly. &quot;I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s
realistic ma&#39;am,&quot; she answered cautiously, &quot;the
Autobots have done as much damage to humanity as the
Decepticons, really.&quot; There was a flash of something
darker in her eyes, &quot;And innocents are caught in the
crossfire.&quot;

Gloval studied her with eyes that were far too
perceptive than Izzy would have wanted. &quot;I&#39;m aware of
your past,&quot; he finally said, &quot;but don&#39;t let it overly
influence you, Lieutenant. I&#39;d hate to see a capable
young officer stall her career. Dismissed.&quot;

&quot;Sir,&quot; Izzy saluted stiffly then left in perfect
military style.

After a few moments Lisa sighed, &quot;She&#39;s not exactly
wrong, sir.&quot;

Gloval nodded glumly but continued, &quot;She&#39;s
occasionally a little blind, Commander.&quot; He sighed,
&quot;Not to mention her personal loss....&quot;

Back in her quarters the underground station Izzy
angrily kicked a pillow, wishing there was something
more substantial in the little room she could knock
around. &quot;Damn it, damn it damn it!&quot; she muttered, &quot;I
can&#39;t believe I shot my mouth off like that!&quot;

Izzy picked up the pillow and tossed it on her bunk,
flopping down to sit on the edge of the bed. As she
let herself relax she sudden seemed less like an
officer and more like a tired, stressed young woman in
her twenties. She rubbed her face with her hands, her
eyes tending to a photo that sat on the dresser
nearby.

Two women stood there in casual clothes, laughing as
they hugged. Izzy looked a little younger than now,
her hair longer and dressed in T-shirt and shorts.
Beside her a older redheaded woman blushed as she was
hugged, trying not to spill the two cups of soda she
carried, her long pants and T-shirt suiting her tall
thin form.

&quot;Commander Helena Chase,&quot; Izzy murmured softly,
remembering.

The Commander had almost frightened Izzy on their
first meeting, this intense officer with a reputation
as a harsh task mistress, and she had expected her
tour at that base to be rough at best. But beneath her
severe exterior was a goof officer, and as they worked
together Izzy had gradually found herself warming to
her. Then there was that meeting at an off base club,
the slow building of a relationship outside of work,
friendship sliding into love.

Then it all came to an end.

The Decepticons had attacked the area looking for
fresh power sources, Starscream leading the team only
to be opposed by some of the Autobots. They fought a
pitched battle around the base, missiles and weapons
firing as the humans crouched in their bunkers
helplessly, and at least some of their weapons went
badly astray.

To this day no one knew who actually fired the shots
that hit the command center, turning it into a mass of
flaming wreckage, but the facility was a total loss.
Frantically digging through the rubble in the
aftermath of the battle Izzy prayed for survivors, but
in the end it was all in vain. They found the dead
body of Commander Chase still at her post, trying to
organize the defense along with most of her command
team.

Izzy had been numb for a while, going through the
motions of her life. She was shocked to discover
Helena had named her in her will, had left everything
to her as well as acknowledged their relationship. She
buried her lover with full military honors, feeling
odd standing in the role of Helena&#39;s wife, even as the
other officers offered their sympathies. As the grief
wore off it was replaced with something else, a
burning rage.

Izzy reached out to the photo, holding it as she
studied the image sadly. &quot;Don&#39;t worry love,&quot; Izzy
murmured finally, &quot;I haven&#39;t even begun making them
pay for taking you away from me.&quot;

End.

Author&#39;s Notes: the characters of Izzy and Helena are
from the Robotech PS2 game Battlecry, though any
relationship between them is purely a product of my
imagination.

The idea that sparked this was simple: why weren&#39;t
humans trying to get involved with the Transfomers
war? This has evolved from a blatant self insert to an
almost &#39;battletech&#39; x-over, but Robotech seemed to be
the best fit. The idea of Dr. Lang reverse engineering
a Veritech from a fallen Decepticon was spawned by the
movie Independence Day as was basing this in Area 51.

I don&#39;t plan to continue this, but I may be surprised.
I expect there will be an Arisugawa&#39;s Locket chapter
tie in, at least, and if I get enough requests I may
fill this out a bit.....</pre>
