<h1>Revenge Road (part 3 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../transformers/index.html">Transformers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../transformers/revroad-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Izzy Randal sat at a back table at the remote little
dive, a bottle of scotch open on the table in front of
her, her glass full. She wore a battered bomber
jacket, various patches sewed on, a T-shirt underneath
and worn jeans. The red haired woman took a drink,
pausing to savor the burn, then set the glass down
with a soft thump.

&quot;This a private party, or can I join you?&quot; the young
man asked, his brown hair falling into his eyes in a
messy mop.

&quot;Jack,&quot; Izzy smiled in recognition, &quot;just in time.&quot;

Jack Archer pulled out a chair, sitting down by his
fellow pilot and old friend. &quot;I&#39;d never miss the
anniversary,&quot; he said gently, taking the glass she had
left for him and filling it. &quot;Any of the others
coming?&quot; he asked, taking his own jacket off and
hanging it on his chair.

&quot;Max Sterling sends his regrets,&quot; Izzy said with a
half smile, &quot;he&#39;s off planet on one of the new space
defense platforms along with his usual partner in
crime, Ben Dixon. They&#39;re hoping to intercept
Decepticon reinforcements from orbit.&quot;

&quot;Think they have a chance?&quot; Jack asked, his casual air
gone, replaced by the look of a professional soldier.

Izzy made a uncertain gesture. &quot;Maybe,&quot; she said, &quot;our
Battloids are good, but we still can&#39;t quite mach a
Decepticon one-on-one, we have to hit them in packs.
If we have a strong enough force up there we can win,
but it&#39;s going to be bloody.&quot;

&quot;About what I figured,&quot; Jack sighed, &quot;what the hell is
command thinking?&quot;

&quot;Remember what Helena used to say?&quot; Izzy smiled
slightly.

&quot;Don&#39;t try to second guess command,&quot; Jack quoted, &quot;you
can&#39;t second guess stupidity.&quot;

They both shared a comfortable laugh, sitting together
in the shadows of the bar. They, along with a few
others, had been survivors of the attack on the base
that had killed their friend Helena Chase and others,
and every year they got back together at this bar near
the rebuilt base to share memories and catch up on the
anniversary of that day.

&quot;You got promoted again?&quot; Izzy asked.

&quot;Lieutenant, after being busted down a few times,&quot;
Jack grinned, &quot;I bet Helena&#39;d have been surprised I
made it.&quot;

&quot;Not really,&quot; Izzy surprised him, &quot;we talked about you
once or twice.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Jack raised his eyebrow curiously.

&quot;She always thought well of you,&quot; Izzy grinned at him,
&quot;even when your latest stunt was driving her nuts.
Helena once said you&#39;d be a great success or get
killed by a superior officer, one of the two.&quot;

&quot;I can almost imagine her saying that,&quot; Jack shook his
head ruefully. He took a drink, &quot;I always wished I
could find someone who suited me the same way you and
Helena had. You never seemed to have any troubles...&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t perfect,&quot; Izzy said, &quot;we had problems with
work keeping us apart, the usual couples stuff. We
just found ways to deal with it.&quot;

&quot;Still, you two were pretty cool,&quot; Jack said then he
smiled suddenly, almost as if a random memory amused
him.

&quot;What?&quot; Izzy asked.

&quot;It was just before your six month anniversary
together, and Chase was running around trying to
figure out what to get you,&quot; Jack chuckled, &quot;I don&#39;t
think I ever saw our usually cool and collected
Commander so frantic before. It was pretty funny.&quot;

&quot;I still have the bracelet she gave me,&quot; Izzy smiled
warmly, thinking of the silver band that rested in a
box in her desk.

Jack picked up his glass, the light shining through it
as he offered the toast, &quot;To absent friends.&quot;

&quot;Absent friends,&quot; Izzy agreed as they tapped their
glasses together.

Meanwhile, aboard the carrier Fortress One Commander
Lisa Hayes frowned at her station on the busy bridge,
studying her fighter and mecha command station. The
brown haired woman was crisp and neat, military
through and through, and seemed to project a aura of
solitude around her amid the usual chaos.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry so much,&quot; Captain Claudia Grant said
gently from her seat nearby, &quot;she&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not worried about Izzy,&quot; Lisa answered a bit
defensively.

Claudia looked amused, her dark skin nearly matching
her brown hair. &quot;You&#39;ve been fretting about it all
day, you know,&quot; she pointed out.

Lisa frowned at her, then sighed. &quot;Today is the
anniversary of the death of her lover,&quot; she said, &quot;I
doubt she&#39;s going to be all right.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s something she has to face,&quot; Claudia said. A
faint smile tugged at her lips, &quot;I was glad to see she
arranged a ride out there and home, too.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to imagine the damage she could do while
piloting a veritech while drunk,&quot; Lisa shook her head.

&quot;She&#39;s not that dumb,&quot; Claudia smiled. She looked at
Lisa curiously, &quot;Have you told her about the request
the Autobots made?&quot;

&quot;For her to part-time as their RDF liaison?&quot; Lisa
grimaced. &quot;She&#39;s going to turn them down flat,&quot; she
said, &quot;and without a care to the consequences to her
career.&quot;

&quot;Most officers would consider it a honor,&quot; Claudia
said wryly.

&quot;Izzy wouldn&#39;t,&quot; Lisa sighed. &quot;Even if she&#39;s softened
her stance a bit, she still loathes the Autobots
almost as much as the Decepticons.&quot;

&quot;Yet she can still work with them,&quot; Claudia said
thoughtfully, &quot;her self control is really pretty
impressive.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Lisa said, deciding not to mention the time
Izzy nearly blew Optimus Prime away a few weeks ago.
Idily she ran through her pilot status reports then
blinked, &quot;No wonder you&#39;re not worried.&quot;

&quot;Roy&#39;s going out to pick her up,&quot; Claudia confirmed.
Her expression was faintly sad, &quot;He knew Chase a while
back, wanted to pay his respects.&quot;

&quot;Gloval did, too,&quot; Lisa nodded, referring to their
previous commander, now the head of the RDF and
overall military commander of Earth&#39;s defense.

&quot;I occassionally find it surprising how close knit the
RDF is,&quot; Claudia admitted.

&quot;The best pilots always seem to know one another,&quot;
Lisa conceded, &quot;so I suppose it only makes sense.&quot;

&quot;Well, Izzy&#39;ll be home for you to check on soon,&quot;
Claudia smirked.

Lisa rolled her eyes.

Out at the bar Izzy rose with a sigh, stretching out a
bit. &quot;Hope I get to see you a bit more often, Jack,&quot;
she said as they weaved through the busy bar.

&quot;Do my best,&quot; Jack wobbled a bit and recovered. The
cold night air hit them both, reviving them a bit as
he added, &quot;And don&#39;t hide out in your plane too much.
Helena wouldn&#39;t have wanted that.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; Izzy conceded as they stood out under the
starry sky.

Off in the distance a rumble slowly grew, then twin
figures soared out from the night in a flash of
silver. Both fighters slowed then almost as one
converted to Guardian mode, skimming along the ground
until they reached the bar and came to a halt.

&quot;Did somebody call for a taxi?&quot; Roy called, his blond
mop of hair visible even under his flight helmet.

&quot;Bunch of comedians,&quot; Izzy sighed.

&quot;Hey Roy,&quot; Jack waved, &quot;you and Claudia still dating?&quot;

&quot;Yep,&quot; Roy nodded. He looked over at the other
veritech, &quot;Little brother, you handing out with is
guy?&quot;

Rick Hunter grinned, &quot;He&#39;s decent.. for a wingman.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll pay for that later,&quot; Jack warned good
naturedly as he climbed aboard.

&quot;You&#39;d better not be sick while in the back seat,&quot; Roy
warned as Izzy climbed in.

&quot;Unlike some people I can hold my booze,&quot; Izzy said
defensively.

&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Roy snorted as they took off.</pre>
