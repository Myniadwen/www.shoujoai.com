<h1>Revenge Road (part 4 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../transformers/index.html">Transformers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../transformers/revroad-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Explosions lit up the sky above the Gulf of Mexico,
the deck of the massive armored aircraft carrier named
Fortress One heaving upwards as energy bolts detonated
against the super tough hull. &quot;Damn it.&quot; Lisa Hayes
growled as the brown haired woman grabbed at her
fighter command console to stay upright.

&quot;Destroids reporting losses,&quot; Vanessa Leeds called
from her station, the brown haired young woman&#39;s
glasses gleaming.

Kim Young pushed her messy hair back, &quot;We&#39;ve lost two
layers of armor to port, repair crews unable to reach
it due to internal fires!&quot;

Captain Claudia Grant kept in her seat as the bridge
shook again, but barely. The dusky skinned officer
growled, &quot;How many are there?&quot;

&quot;Not many,&quot; Lisa said as she studied the fighter
command station, &quot;but they&#39;ve got Megatron out there.&quot;

Floating high above Fortress One Megatron stood ahead
of five Decepticons, the silver-grey giant focused
with deadly intensity on the massive vessel. &quot;Breech
their defenses,&quot; he commanded his troops.

&quot;We&#39;re trying,&quot; Thundercracker said as he fired his
incenderary guns, superheating the enemy&#39;s armor, &quot;but
we don&#39;t have much time!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll crack them like an egg,&quot; Thrust said cockily.

&quot;Where are the Constructicons?&quot; Megatron fired his arm
cannon even as they dodged fired from destroids on the
surface of Fortress One. &quot;What happened to the
Insecticons?&quot; he demanded coldly.

&quot;Attacking Fortress Five,&quot; Soundwave revealed, his
dark blue armor gleaming, &quot;all still offering stiff
resistence.&quot;

&quot;Look out, boss!&quot; Rumble yelled out a warning, the
smaller light blue Decepticon zipping to the side.

The massive Autobot transport Jetfire exploded through
their ranks in his jet mode, then sweeping down
towards the battered deck of Fortress One. The rear
hatch opened up to release Autobots, dropping the, to
the deck even as Jetfire himself switched to his robot
mode, red and white armor gleaming.

&quot;All right Autobots,&quot; Springer said briskly, the green
skinned Autobot hefting a weapon, &quot;let&#39;s pay the
humans back for saving Autobot City today!&quot;

&quot;They did WHAT?&quot; Megatron roared even as the first
beams of energy raced at them from below, accompanied
by more human missiles and projectiles. &quot;Never mind,&quot;
he waved that off, &quot;KILL THEM!&quot;

&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Thundercracker said, pointing off to where
even more figures were approaching from the distance.

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Blitzwing scowled, the DEcepticon triple
changer&#39;s abilities largely useless in this battle.

&quot;This is Izzy Randal of the RDF,&quot; a woman&#39;s furious
voice came over all frequencies, &quot;withdraw, or be
destroyed.&quot;

&quot;Impudent fleshlings,&quot; Megatron scowled even as a
dozen Veritech fighters arrives, joining in to what
was quickly becoming a wild melee.

&quot;Tactical situation changing,&quot; Soundwave noted.

&quot;You mean we&#39;re out gunned,&quot; Rumble agreed, firing
too.

&quot;Remember there are Autobots on Fortress One,&quot; Izzy
said as the redhead pilot lead the charge on the
Decepticon forces, &quot;anything else is a fair target.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Rick Hunter said nervously. The brown
haired pilot paused then asked, &quot;What about...
Megatron?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s mine,&quot; Izzy purred as her wing engaged the
enemy.

The RDF forces all rapidly shifted to either the
Guardian or Battleoid modes, the half robot or fully
robotic forms best suited to this kind of slower
midair combat. Pairing up they raced to engage the
Decepticons, ably assisted by the increasing levels of
fire support from Fortress One and the Autobots.

&quot;Incredible,&quot; Jetfire murmured as one green trimmed
battleoid closed in to engage Megatron, dodging and
weaving while maintaining steady fire. With a burst of
his own jest he was in the air, racing to help.

&quot;Cursed fleshling,&quot; Megatron shielded his face from a
eerily precise shot, his armor denting slightly under
the powerful slugs.

Decepticon armor could shrug off most Earth arms
easily, but they were still vulnerable to physics. A
round of sufficient mass and density, thrown with
enough force could harm a Decepticon, and obviously
the technicians behind the Vertitech had figured out
how to do that.

&quot;Withdraw recommended,&quot; Soundwave said in his cold,
emotionless voice.

&quot;WE can still WIN,&quot; Megatron swept his arm up with
remarkable speed and fired off a devastating bolt of
energy.

&#39;Oh hell,&#39; Izzy tried to move but it was too close and
fast, the energy bolt blasting away armor and sending
her spiraling down to the gulf.

&quot;Megatron,&quot; Jetfire growled and opened up with
everything he had, firing off missiles and his rife
wildly.

Watching his force being hammered, his momentary
victory fading as he assessed the odds Megatron made
the only call he could. &quot;Decepticons, he called,
&quot;retreat!&quot;

Already transformed Thrust raced away saying, &quot;You
don&#39;t have to tell me twice.&quot; Within moments the
Decepticons were gone, vanishing into the distance.

&quot;That veritech,&quot; Arcee called from where she stood on
the deck, &quot;it&#39;s sinking!&quot;

&quot;Oh hell,&quot; Izzy scowled as her battleoid sank, water
coming in. Blood matted her scalp and ran into her
eyes as she struggled with the emergency release. The
damage or maybe the water had frozen everything, ozone
from shorting systems in the air.

Then, surprisingly, Izzy help her battleloid&#39;s descent
stop, then slowly but sheerly she began to rise again.
Surprisingly she heard her helmet radio activate as
she heard a female voice say, &quot;You&#39;re going to be all
right.&quot;

&quot;Heave, ho!&quot; Springer yelled as he, Hot Rod and
Jetfire hauled on a chain, drawing the battleoid and
Arcee up on the deck.

&quot;Thank you for all your help.&quot; Lisa Hayes said as she
watched in awe as they worked, slightly shaken by how
quickly they acted. With no thought to her own safety
Arcee had grabbed the destroid hauling chain and leapt
off the side of Fortress One, swimming down to Izzy
while counting on her friends to haul them up.

&quot;We owe you one,&quot; Hot Rod said, the red and gold
sports-car Autobot grinning.

&quot;The battleoid&#39;s taken on a lot of water,&quot; Arcee
reported as they hit the deck.

&quot;The outside release is here,&quot; Lisa pointed, trying
not to think of all the things that could have gone
wrong, not to mention the severe damage all along one
side of the battleoid.

With a wet splosh the head of the battleoid tilted
back and the seats slid forth, revealing a wet,
battered but very much still alive Izzy Randal.
&quot;Megatron,&quot; she gasped as she struggle to get the
buckles of her flight harness loose, &quot;is he...?&quot;

&quot;Gone, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; Springer volunteered. He knelt
down beside her, studying her as he said, &quot;You&#39;d make
a good Autobot, Officer...?&quot;

&quot;Izzy Randal,&quot; she scowled. Her expression softened
just a bit as she asked, &quot;Who was it who rescued me?&quot;

&quot;Arcee,&quot; Hot Rod gestured, the Autobot grinning
slightly.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Izzy nodded to the pink Autobot.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Arcee said softly. She frowned,
seeing the blood still trickling down from Izzy&#39;s
hair, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

Izzy smiled, but it was painful as she confessed, &quot;Not
really.&quot;

&quot;Come on,&quot; Lisa grabbed her, &quot;we&#39;re taking you to sick
bay.&quot;</pre>
