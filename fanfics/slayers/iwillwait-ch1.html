<h1>I Will Wait for You Until the End of Time</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dragonhealer.html">Dragonhealer</a><br> </h2>
<pre>They say you are a cold-blooded killer who rampages village to village, 
purging thieves for their treasures without a single thought for their 
lives

Even the mightiest dragons fear the mere mentioning of your name

They say you are known as the infamous bandit-killer, that your 
reputation strikes fear into the hearts of bandits, thieves and villains 
all across the country

Others say you are a legend, that many of your noblest deeds have been 
recorded in history books for generations to come

That you are a hero, a savoir, who would work any job, even risk your 
own life to the point of death for the sake of the innocent, as long as 
the price was paid

Thus brings us to this question

Which one are you?

They say fate is an odd thing

They say opposites attract

They say love is the strangest emotion of all time

Perhaps the sayings are correct for I, Amelia, second princess of the 
holy kingdom of Saillune, have fallen hopelessly in love with you

From the moment we met, I first saw you as an idol, a role model, 
someone I have always looked up to.

You are everything I have ever dreamed of being, as if you were a fallen 
angel, an angel of my most inner and hidden dream

I have opened my heart to you, no, you have already captured it

You have given me everything beyond my wildest imagination

They call you a monster, but I have seen through your dark reputation. 
Instead, I see a kind soul, a spirit free of many bonds, that could 
never be broken

Just the sound of your voice is enough to melt my heart and make my 
spirits soar

Feeling your hand on my cheek, your arms around me, your eyes looking 
back into mine, I could stay like this forever

I would give up my life here in Saillune, just to be with you

I would follow you to the ends of the planet, wherever we go, I would be 
there with you

Your beautiful smile, your beautiful eyes, your angelic voice, your 
spirit, your soul

What began as childish admiration has deepened into love. In the three 
years that we have been together, I must finally make my confession

I love you, Lina Inverse

Amelia wil Telsa Saillune

Taking a deep breath, the princess puts her pen down and leans against 
her chair, closing her eyes and letting it out slowly. It has been 
almost an entire month since she and the sorceress have separated. She 
had gone on a journey and had promised to return once her mission was 
fulfilled. However, with each minute passing by with eager anticipation, 
the princess&#39; heart has ached more and more. A soft smile creeps across 
her face. This was the moment she has been waiting for. Giggling softly, 
she feels like she has been waiting for her knight in shining armor. 
Looking out the window she quietly watches the sunset. Such a beautiful 
sight. If only she were here to watch it with her. Suddenly, something 
catches her eye. She leans in closer and a soft gasp escapes her throat. 
A mysterious figure has appeared in front of the sunset, her long cape 
fluttering against the gentle breeze. Clasping a hand over her mouth, 
the princess&#39;s eyes slowly widen. Her knight has finally returned. 
Grabbing the poem and folding it gently, she tucks it safely away and 
runs out of her room to welcome the sorceress. She runs out of the 
palace and eagerly awaits. The sorceress quietly makes her way towards 
the entrance and stops, smiling as she sees the awaiting young princess.

&quot;Amelia,&quot; her voice is soft and seems to ring a bell within the 
princess&#39;s heart.

Smiling, she runs over and flings her arms around the sorceress&#39;s waist, 
hugging her tightly. Happy tears run down her face. &quot;Lina. I&#39;ve been 
waiting for you for so long.&quot;

She holds the young princess close to her, looking down and gently 
caressing her hair. &quot;I know. I&#39;m back now. I&#39;ve missed you.&quot;

&quot;Lina, I must tell you something. Please, let&#39;s go inside?&quot; She takes 
Lina&#39;s hand and gives it a gentle squeeze.

Squeezing it in return Lina smiles and nods. As the two return to the 
palace, the sunset slowly disappears behind the landscape, and the night 
sky unveils its stars.
