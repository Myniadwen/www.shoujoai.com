<h1>The Slayers Matrix (part 14 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hawk.html">Hawk Shadowharper</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../slayers/matrix-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>           Lina attaches her harness to one of the elevator&#39;s cables 
and locks it tight. Seraya watches as she pulls out one of her 
handguns and shoots low at a cable. It snaps and the elevator drops a 
moment as the weight balance changes. 
           They look at each other as she moves closer; both wrap an 
arm tight around the other&#39;s waist then look up. &quot;There is no spoon,&quot; 
Lina whispers as she holds the smaller blond closer, then looks down 
and shoots the last cable. It breaks and the elevator sinks away below 
them, the counterweight pulling them up quickly. 
           At each floor, sparks fly as the emergency brakes try and 
fail to stop the elevator. When it hits the bottom floor the bomb 
explodes; the doors are blown off and the lobby fills with fire. 

           The entire building shakes and the Dragons sway a little as 
the lights go out. A moment later, the sprinkler system goes off. All 
three look up. 

           Lina hands Seraya the gun she used to break the elevator&#39;s 
cables, and they both nod before swinging over and kicking the door to 
the roof open. 

           Valgarv&#39;s teeth clench before he looks at Milgasia, &quot;Find 
them and destroy them!&quot; The taller Gold looks miserable from the 
freezing cold water as he holds a hand over his earpiece. 

           &quot;I repeat, we are under attack,&quot; the helicopter pilot 
shouts into his headset. One man is down on his face with a fiery bolt 
sticking out of his back. Seraya whips the gun across another cop&#39;s 
face, causing him to drop. Lina holds two more officers&#39; weapons as 
icy magic spills into them, causing one to stumble backwards and the 
second to cry out, grip loosening on his gun. 
           One dazed cop gets back to his feet and lunges at Seraya, 
knife he&#39;s holding reflecting the sunlight. She ducks low and he 
gurgles when an icicle embeds itself in his stomach. 
           The pilot watches in horror as the two women pound on the 
rest of his unit, but his horror becomes worse when he has a waking 
nightmare. A shining gold ghost of a dragon roars as it sweeps towards 
him. He screams when it bites down on him and Milgasia appears in his 
place inside the helicopter. 
           Lina takes the gun from the officer&#39;s hands and sweeps the 
butt of the weapon up, cracking it into his chin. He slumps to the 
ground but Lina&#39;s already turned, firing at an officer running towards 
Seraya. He goes down. Behind her the last remaining officer pushes to 
his feet, aiming at the redhead&#39;s back. The knife Seraya&#39;s holding 
gets a burst of speed from a wind spell and thuds into the cop&#39;s 
forehead. He falls back. 
           Milgasia steps out of the helicopter as Lina tosses down 
the gun. She then looks up at Seraya and notices how tense the blond 
is. Guessing what&#39;s behind her, Lina turns her head away. She then 
turns around quickly, two handguns firing at the Dragon. 
           Milgasia&#39;s body seems to blur as his hands move, small 
bursts of energy hitting each individual bullet and disintegrating it. 
Too soon Lina&#39;s handguns both click, empty. &quot;Seraya,&quot; she calls out, 
tossing the guns down. &quot;Help!&quot; Milgasia draws his gun and fires. 
           Time turns to syrup, Lina&#39;s limbs moving at only a fraction 
of their normal speed. She lifts her hand in front of the first bullet 
and a small fireball burns it away. She starts to lean back as more 
shots are fired, each one being stopped in a similar fashion as 
Milgasia used. After the fourth bullet she can&#39;t move fast enough, a 
fifth grazes her right shoulder and a sixth tears through the outside 
of her left thigh. She&#39;s leaned back too far and falls onto her back, 
time moving normally as she gasps for breath, hardly noticing the 
burning pain in her shoulder and leg. 
           A shadow looms over her and she looks up, Milgasia lifting 
his gun and blocking out the sun. &quot;Only human,&quot; he says grimly, ready 
to put the last bullet into the woman&#39;s head. 
           Suddenly a cold metal barrel is behind him and he turns his 
head to the left, Seraya&#39;s handgun against his temple. &quot;Dodge this,&quot; 
she says up to him and fires, the Dragon falling back. His body glows 
bright gold and Seraya looks away as the ghostly image rises from the 
pilot&#39;s dead body then disappears back into the building. 
           Releasing a breath of relief, Lina tugs her sunglasses off 
and sets them aside. Seraya offers a hand and pulls the redhead to her 
feet, and she winces a bit at the graze on her thigh. 
           &quot;How did you do that,&quot; Seraya asks. 
           &quot;Do what?&quot; Lina looks at the blond as she pulls off her 
trench coat and starts to unfasten the empty harness, last handgun 
tucked into her belt at the small of her back. 
           &quot;You moved like they do,&quot; she nods at the dead pilot. &quot;I&#39;ve 
never seen anyone move that fast.&quot; Lina looks at the cut on her right 
shoulder then back at the smaller girl. 
           &quot;It wasn&#39;t fast enough.&quot; Ser watches Lina thoughtfully 
while the taller woman looks over at the helicopter. &quot;Can you fly that 
thing?&quot; Seraya pulls off her sunglasses and looks at it. 
           &quot;Not yet.&quot; She pulls out her cell phone and dials as Lina 
watches. 

           &quot;Operator.&quot; 
           &quot;Hawk, I need a pilot program for a B-212 helicopter.&quot; He 
nods and finds the program, quickly loading it up. &quot;Hurry.&quot; When he 
finds the program it starts to load, Seraya&#39;s closed eyes on the 
Dragon Slayer fluttering. 

           Inside the Matrix Lina watches the blonde&#39;s fluttering 
eyelids then blinks when they open. &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; They start walking to 
the helicopter. 

--- 

           Valgarv and Filia look up as Milgasia steps in, the floor 
flooded with water from the sprinklers. Then they all look out the 
window as a helicopter flies into view, Lina standing behind the large 
gattling gun mounted on it. Valgarv narrows his eyes at the sight. 
&quot;No.&quot; 
           Lina pulls the trigger and the large weapon starts 
spinning, spewing out dozens of bullets. Filia falls just after 
drawing her weapon and her ghost leaves the officer&#39;s dead body, going 
through the wall. Milgasia drops down and tries to get to the door but 
he&#39;s not fast enough, long bullets pounding into him. His own golden 
ghost joins Filia&#39;s in going out of the office. The wall and floor get 
chewed up as more and more bullets fly. 
           Valgarv gets the most shots off as he tries to kneel behind 
the office&#39;s couch. Lina follows his movement and sweeps the weapon 
down from the two dead cops and up towards Valgarv, the couch 
exploding with each hit. The Ancient falls back and his ghost is black 
as it leaves. 
           The tingling of spent bullets stop and the smoking cylinder 
slows down to a halt, Lina looking through the huge hole in the window 
at Xelloss sitting alone in the room. &quot;Xelloss, get up,&quot; she urges him 
quietly. &quot;Get up, get up!&quot; 
           Her leader slowly lifts his head, water dripping down from 
his soaked hair. He blinks several times before his purple eyes 
reappear, clear and alert. He sees the helicopter and starts to pull 
at the handcuffs with a shout, the metal chain slowly giving away 
before breaking apart. 
           Seraya watches out of the pilot&#39;s window as he starts 
pulling the various sensors still attached to him and the laptop off, 
and then stands. The sound of the door opening makes him look to his 
left. All three Dragons are back with newly possessed bodies. At the 
sight of Xelloss standing, Valgarv draws his gun and starts firing at 
the running rebel through the office wall. 
           The bullets break through the wall and streak through the 
air, but the last one embeds itself in Xel&#39;s leg and he stumbles in 
running towards the window before jumping out. 
           &quot;He&#39;s not going to make it,&quot; Lina says quickly to herself 
before getting out from behind the gattling gun. She jumps out towards 
Xelloss, long safety strap attached to her back. They both fly towards 
each other then collide in midair, falling quickly and trying to keep 
a grip on each other. 
           Lina&#39;s harness comes to a sudden stop and jerks her out of 
Xel&#39;s grip, but she grabs his wrist at the last instant. &quot;Gotcha!&quot; 
Xelloss looks up at her, then down at the street far below. 
           Seraya sees they&#39;re both safe then starts flying the 
helicopter away, careful about how far below Lina and Xelloss are. In 
the building Valgarv moves to the window, watching them leave. He 
lifts his gun and fires. 
           Two bullets impact the helicopter and fuel starts spraying 
out. Alarms go off around Seraya as fuel pressure quickly drops. She 
tries to get a safe distance away from the Dragons as she looks around 
for a safe place for Lina and Xelloss to land. 
           Further downtown she sees a building with two levels of 
large, flat roof. Aiming for that even as the helicopter&#39;s blades spin 
slower, she forces it to stay low enough so Lina and Xelloss can jump. 
           Looking up as she and Xel dangle, Lina sees smoke pouring 
from the helicopter as it gets harder and harder to fly. Noticing what 
Seraya&#39;s doing, she waits until they&#39;re close enough then lets Xelloss 
go. He falls onto the top roof level and rolls to a stop, eyes on the 
helicopter and the redhead hanging from it. 
           The alarms get more frantic as the rotors slow down enough 
to not be able to keep the helicopter up and it starts to fall towards 
the next building. Lina lands on the level of roof below Xelloss and 
rolls back to her feet, gripping the safety strap in both hands. She 
looks up when the helicopter passes overhead. &quot;Seraya,&quot; she whispers. 
           Looking down, she throws the strap up and wraps it around 
her hands. The helicopter passes below the edge of the roof as the 
rotors slow more and more. Once the slack runs out, Lina gets pulled 
off her feet and starts sliding towards the edge of the roof. Xelloss, 
back to his feet, watches anxiously. 
           The building filling her view and controls not responding 
at all, Seraya climbs out of her pilot&#39;s chair and goes back to where 
the harness is attached to the helicopter&#39;s floor. She grabs hold of 
it and, using the same gun Lina gave her, shoots it. She jumps out of 
the helicopter after dropping the gun, swinging towards the building 
Xelloss and Lina landed on top of. 
           Lina hits the lip of concrete at the edge of the roof and 
uses her feet like a fulcrum, being pulled up into standing. She looks 
down and sees Seraya falling away from the helicopter as it crashes 
into the next building. When it hits, the glass ripples strangely 
before exploding outward. 
           As fire engulfs the destroyed helicopter, Seraya hits a 
window that spider-cracks from the impact. The heat and light forces 
Lina to look away for several moments, then looks down and starts to 
pull Seraya up. 

           &quot;I knew it,&quot; Hawk whispers, staring at the Matrix code. 
&quot;She&#39;s the One.&quot; 

           Lina finishes pulling the strap up hand over hand and takes 
Seraya&#39;s, pulling her up onto the roof. Once they&#39;re safely there, 
their grip on each other remains, both women trembling from the close 
call, light blue eyes staring up into crimson eyes. 
           &quot;Do you believe it now, Seraya,&quot; Xelloss asks after getting 
down to their level of the roof and moving to beside the two. The 
smaller girl looks up and nods slightly. 
           &quot;Xelloss,&quot; Lina starts, not looking up immediately from 
Seraya. &quot;The Oracle. She told me I--&quot; 
           &quot;She told you,&quot; Xelloss interrupts, meeting her eye, 
&quot;exactly what you needed to hear. That&#39;s all.&quot; Lina doesn&#39;t like the 
answer and shakes her head a little. &quot;Lina, sooner or later you&#39;re 
going to realize just as I did, there&#39;s a difference between knowing 
the path, and walking the path.&quot; She looks into his purple eyes, 
considering. 

--- 

           &quot;Operator,&quot; Hawk asks hopefully. 
           &quot;Hawk.&quot; Xelloss. Alive. Safe. 
           &quot;Goddamn, it&#39;s good to hear your voice, sir.&quot; 
           &quot;We need an exit.&quot; 
           &quot;Got one ready,&quot; he replies with a grin. &quot;Subway station, 
State and Balbo.&quot; 

--- 

           The Dragons push the roof door open and find it empty. A 
safety harness is on the ground but nothing else. Valgarv goes over 
and picks it up, gripping it tightly between his hands. They got away 
once more. &quot;Dammit!&quot; 
           &quot;The trace was completed,&quot; Filia notes as she looks up at 
Milgasia. 
           &quot;We have their position,&quot; he notes. 
            &quot;The sentinels are standing by,&quot; Filia adds, and then she 
and Milgasia look at Valgarv. 
            &quot;Order the strike.&quot; He then turns with Filia and they 
leave the rooftop. 
           &quot;They&#39;re not out yet,&quot; mutters Valgarv as he looks at the 
city&#39;s skyline, fire and police sirens echoing from the streets below.
