<h1>Lina and Naga: Partners (part 4 of 5)</h1>

<a href="../slayers/partners-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>	It was nightfall once more, and having been entranced by the
smells of lunch and dinner, Lina had failed to allocate time for
finding an inn for the evening.  So they had found their way back to
the clearing of the night before, marked by a ring of charred stones
and ashes of the Lina&#39;s night watch.
	Naga had managed to start the fire this time before passing
out over the remaining two jugs of ale.  Lina was glad that Naga
hadn&#39;t noticed anything too odd about her behavior earlier, choosing
to attribute it to eating too much too quickly.  In a sense
she was glad that Naga had passed out.	She needed to be alone for
the moment, to sort out her feelings...
	Her feelings for Naga?
	Lina pulled her cloak closely around her shoulders.  Naga and
her had been friends for a while now, since their days at the
Academy.  And when they hadn&#39;t been friends, they had been &#39;rivals&#39;
which usually equated to Naga irritating and stalking her until she
relented to them traveling together.  Now that she thought of
it, there were few times that she had been without Naga during her
travels.  True she had recently managed to evade Naga when she had
traveled with Gourry, Amelia and Zelgadis, but Naga always had a way
of finding her.  It was as if Naga had an instinct homing ability when
it concerned Lina.
	Still, through their years at the Academy, and of travelling
together, this was the first time that Lina had ever &#39;felt&#39; anything
but animosity or annoyance towards Naga.
	Now though...she wasn&#39;t sure what was going on.  Her eyes
lingered on Naga&#39;s chest a little too long, her hips felt a little
too weak after each accidental touch.  She thought she might be going
crazy, she thought it might be the after effects of her recent Dragu
Slave.
	But as she watched Naga sleeping, she knew it was something
else.  Something completely new to her...but something instinctive,
none the less.
	Her eyes fell to Naga&#39;s rising chest again, and this time,
the stirring between her legs was fiercer than ever before.  She
moved before she knew what she was doing.  Slowly, cautiously, she
crawled over to Naga&#39;s side.
	From here, the sorceress was even more beautiful, the haughty
look replaced with something softer.  Her raven locks fell gently
against her cheek, and entwined her slender body like a serpent.
	Lina felt her breath quicken as she took in the creamy flesh
and the lean muscle of the dark maiden.  She glanced again to Naga&#39;s
chest, and this time, she reached out, her fingers trembling as they
traced an invisible barrier hovering but millimeters over Naga&#39;s right
breast.
	Lina closed her eyes.  Naga slept so tight.  She wouldn&#39;t
notice, Lina thought.  She wouldn&#39;t notice if I just...touched...
	Summoning her courage, Lina lightly brushed against the tip
of Naga&#39;s nipple.  That dull ache that had rippled through her
earlier returned, pulsing between her legs and her own nipples.  She
knew they were hard, and she took secret satisfaction in seeing Naga&#39;s
stiffen slightly as well.
	Naga did not stir.
	Lina felt a touch of her usual brashness return.  She brushed
the nipple again with her right hand, her left caressing the slight
mounds of her own breasts.  Another dull shock rippled through her,
and she trembled as she savored the sensation.
	She encircled Naga&#39;s bound nipple with the tip of her index
finger, watching entranced as it hardened even more before her eyes. 
Her left hand had found its way beneath her pale yellow shirt, and
was rubbing her girlish nub softly at first, but now, a little more
roughly.
	Lina almost screamed as Naga stirred for a moment, only to
shift her body weight.	Her breasts were even more exposed to Lina
now.
	The flame-haired sorceress breathed a sigh of relief, and
reprimanded herself.  But try as she might, she could not bring
herself to break away from the dark maiden&#39;s side.
	Lina swallowed a deep breath of air.  And then, she pried
slowly, the skin-tight leather imprisoning Naga&#39;s right nipple.  She
gasped as it came loose, and she felt a hunger well up in the pit of
her stomach as she looked upon the perfect chocolate bud.
	She played slowly with it first, and then, found the courage
to flick it softly.  Naga moaned, to Lina&#39;s surprise, but remained
asleep.  Think of it as a very good dream, Lina hoped.	She glanced
nervously back to the erect nipple.
	And gently, took it in her mouth, tasting the salt of Naga&#39;s
skin as she lapped her tongue around it.
	Her left hand had long since abandoned her nipples, and now
strayed between her legs, pushing, pressing at some sort of nub that
had suddenly erupted there.  Her scarlet pants were moist there, hot
and pulsing.
	Lina couldn&#39;t help herself.  She unbuckled the belt to her
pants, and slipped her right hand inside, seeking the nub that called
to her with delicious fervor.  Her left hand returned to her breasts,
and she pulled and tugged at the erect nipples and squeezed her small
breasts.  She would have moaned in ecstasy but her lips and mouth
worked along Naga&#39;s nipple, suckling it to the point of bruising.
	She found the nub she sought through her panties, and she
rubbed at it, pulling every so often to extinguish the desire between
her legs.  And with a triumphant yelp, she suddenly felt the release
that rocked her entire body twice over, before she fell limply over
Naga&#39;s body.
	And it was then, that Naga awoke.
