<a href="../slayers/curses-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&lt;Warm... it&#39;s warm.&gt; Seraya slowly opened her eyes, seeing the sky a shade
of orange and yellow from the rising sun. &lt;What a strange dream... and it
felt good.&gt; A strange sensation made itself aware, someone was beside her.
Sensing who it was without looking, Ser&#39;s eyes widened. &lt;It... it wasn&#39;t a
dream...?&gt;

&lt;Why did she do this all of a sudden? Why now?&gt; Ser blushed softly and
closed her eyes again. &lt;It felt so nice, though...&gt;

Lina groaned quietly and buried her head further into her pillow, unaware
that she was still partially on top of Ser and the softness she mistook
for a pillow was actually the blond girl&#39;s chest. Ser blushed deeper,
opening her eyes and carefully looking down at Lina.

&lt;Wow, what a dream that was.&gt; Lina sighed and smiled lightly to herself.
&lt;Even if it was just a dream, it was nice.&gt; She became aware of something
odd about her pillow. The sorceress slowly opened her eyes, finding
herself staring at her friend&#39;s breasts. Lina blinked then blushed as red
as her hair. &lt;It... it wasn&#39;t a dream...&gt;

She remembered the night all too well, then. &lt;I... I forced her to...&gt; She
slowly looked up towards Ser, finding the healer was already watching
her. Blue eyes stared into red eyes for a moment. &quot;...Seraya...&quot;

Across the cold fireplace, Zel watched nervously. Both girls were awake,
and he was worried about what would happen. Hidden in the shadows of the
forest, Xel watched as well, anger at seeing Lina on his Ser-chan slowly
rising anew. Also hidden, but not in the same dimension, Granite waited
for the order from his Lord.

A nervous tension filled the air, and for several seconds no one even
breathed.

&quot;...&quot; Lina jumped to her feet and backed away slowly. &quot;Seraya-san, I...
I&#39;m sorry, I...&quot; Guilt nearly drowned the red head. &lt;I forced her! She
must hate me...&gt; &quot;Please forgive me, I...&quot; Unable to face her any longer,
Lina ran off into the shadows, disappearing from sight.

&quot;... Lina-san...&quot; Seraya climbed out of the bedding and back to her feet,
ignoring her state of dress for the moment. Zel looked away politely,
however the other two pairs of hidden eyes weren&#39;t so considerate. &quot;...
Why did she run away...?&quot;

&quot;I think she thinks she forced you, Ser-san.&quot; Seraya turned quickly,
looking at the golem.

&quot;I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true, the whole time... I sensed that
dark spell...&quot; Zel looked back, cautiously watching Ser&#39;s face.

&quot;That dark spell you sensed yesterday morning?&quot;

&quot;It seemed the same...&quot; Ser sighed quietly. &quot;What Lina-san did... it
wasn&#39;t because of her own choice, that spell... it was a manipulative
spell now that I think about it.&quot; Xel listened intently. &lt;Only a control
spell...? Who would cast something like that on Lina?&gt;

&quot;But it was powerful enough that Lina didn&#39;t know.&quot; Ser nodded, eyes
paled softly.

&quot;We have to find her, before - &quot; She suddenly disappeared, and Zel&#39;s eyes
widened slightly.

&quot;Seraya? Seraya?!&quot; He looked around, but she was nowhere to be seen. He
couldn&#39;t sense her presense either.

&quot;Ser-chan!?&quot; The chimera saw Xel appear from the shadows and suddenly
became even more worried. The look on the Trickster&#39;s face... he was
surprised, and angry. &quot;Where is she??&quot;

&quot;If you don&#39;t know then I surely don&#39;t.&quot; Xel opened her eyes and glared
at Zel dangerously. &quot;The question is... who took her?&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ser&#39;s words cut off in her throat and she blinked in surprise. One second
he was talking to Zel, the next....? She didn&#39;t know where she was as she
looked around. The place was very shadowed and dark, and she sensed a
strangely familiar energy around the place. &quot;Wh... where am I?&quot;

&quot;Ah, my dear Seraya... welcome to my home.&quot; She looked towards the voice,
seeing an even more shadowy figure walking towards her. Dark energy
pounded her senses and she cringed, trying to block it out. &quot;Don&#39;t fight
me, beautiful one.. it will only make things more difficult.&quot;

&quot;N-no, send me back, please...!&quot; The figure stepped into the &quot;light&quot; and
she saw him clearly for the first time. He was tall, at least as tall as
Xelloss, built along the same lines as well. That&#39;s where the similarity
ended.

&quot;I cannot send you back, not until I&#39;m...&quot; He smirked, piercing blue eyes
drifting lazily up and down her form. Ser blushed deeply and crossed her
arms over her chest. He chuckled quietly. &quot;... finished with you. You
see, my lovely, I always get what I want.&quot; He turned those eyes directly
into her&#39;s and the small girl shivered, feeling like he was seeing right
through her. &quot;And right now... you&#39;re what I want.&quot;
