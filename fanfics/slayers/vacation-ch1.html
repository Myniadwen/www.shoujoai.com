<h1>Lina's Shortened Vacation</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rvincent.html">Robert Vincent</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Lina Inverse was enjoying some well deserved time off. Sure bandit
killing and treasure hunting didn&#39;t get boring per say, but they did
get monotonous. She had sent her traveling companions away with the
intention of meeting up a couple days later at the center of the town
she was in. It wasn&#39;t a big town, it was just big enough to make it on
the map but small enough to lack the feel of a big city. Her plans for
the week were simple, eat, sleep, and relax. She had paid for her hotel
room for the entire week in advance, no need to worry about that. She
also slipped the hotel keeper a little extra money to keep her stay
there a secret, that way she would not be interrupted in her
relaxation.

Once she was settled in Lina flopped onto the bed causing it to emit
loud creaking noises. This was the life she thought to herself in
bliss, no Gourry, no Zel, no Amelia, and best of all no Xelloss. She
gazed at the ceiling pondering what to do next. She could just lay
there all day or so she thought until she heard the tell tale grumbling
of her stomach. She giggled lightly to herself, &quot;I guess that its time
to eat&quot; she patted her stomach with a touch of affection and moved out
of bed. She strapped her sword to the side of her signature outfit and
grabbed the door knob but just as she was about to turn it she
remembered something. &quot;Damn I almost forgot my money!&quot; she quickly
moved to the nightstand by the bed and after a couple seconds of
rooting around underneath it produced a small bag of coins.

Her trip to the restaurant was uneventful the setting sun creating a
dramatic background with her cape billowing gracefully in the subtle
wind. The place that she chose to eat was only a couple minuets from
her inn and she was walking in the door before even she expected to be
doing so. Unlike most of the times she walked into a place like this no
one stopped eating and started starring possibly due to the absence of
a large group of conspicuous individuals. She simply walked over to an
empty booth and took a seat. The waiter came over and asked her for her
order. She responded with the very Lina like response of &quot;I&#39;ll take
everything from here to here (gestures on menu with her finger
indicating the entire dinner column) and this, this, and this, triple
portions on the last two&quot; she said happily. Without the rest of the
gang she would have the entire meal for herself and she wouldn&#39;t be
hungry for a while. The waiter was shocked so shocked he just sat there
with his mouth agape just starring at her. She was sort of expecting
this response so she went to plan two. She dumped her bag of coins on
the table and looked at the waiter, &quot;I&#39;m serious&quot; she said in a voice
that allowed no argument. The waiter gulped once and walked steadily
into the back room.

As Lina waited for her food she took a look at all the people around
her. She had become a good judge of people just by looking at them,
shure she wasn&#39;t completely accurate but she couldn&#39;t help herself. Her
eyes would go from one person to another and give them the name she
decided on. Thief, thief, warrior, thief, wanna be sorcerer, apprentice
thief, there sure were a lot of thieves in here she thought to herself.
She pulled her money that was scattered on the table toward her
managing not to draw any attention but not caring if she did anyway.
She was after all the great Lina Inverse and she could take care of
herself.

The food arrived sooner then she thought it would. It looked delicious
to the point of perfection. Her mouth started to water from looking at
it, she hadn&#39;t been this excited about eating since the possibility of
eating lake dragon but that turned out to be a hoax. There before her
now was a feast big enough for a small army and fit for a king. There
were chickens and rabbits, stews and sauces, and more cow prepared in
more ways then most normal people could imagine and to top it off
enough to drink for five people. Lina dug in with reckless abandon. The
appetizers were gone before most people could bat an eye, the shocked
looks on the surrounding people&#39;s faces were priceless but Lina hardly
took notice. She had already started in on the main courses just as the
final plate of her meal was sat upon the table. Several of the
customers simply sat in shock at the brutal way in which Lina was
attacking her meal. By anyone&#39;s estimates that would be enough food to
feed any traveler for days but in just under twenty minutes the
mountains of food were a memory. All that remained were scattered bread
crumbs and greasy plates along with the occasional splattering of a
sauce or stew, even most of the bones were gone!

She was in a good mood so she made sure to leave a half way generous
amount of money on the table for all of the delicious food. Then
without a word she left with some people still gazing at the spot she
had just vacated. Outside the sun had set and the moon had begun its
ascent into the sky, it wasn&#39;t a full moon but it was really close with
only a tiny sliver missing. The cool autumn air was a refreshing
comfort to Lina because she had been cooped up in the crowded
restaurant for so long. She gazed up at the stars occasionally as she
walked. They were beautiful, she didn&#39;t feel she had much time to look
at them much any more but tonight she allowed herself to enjoy them on
her way back to the inn. She reached her room as the peaceful relaxed
feeling that had been building up all night reached its peak drawing
her to the bed.

She slept the sleep of the dead that night, such a deep sleep that she
could not remember any dreams or disruptions throughout the night. She
awoke feeling more refreshed then she had felt in years. She did not
get out of bed however she just laid there for well over an hour. She
felt and looked very comfortable, she had her body entwined in the
covers so tightly that they appeared to have become a second skin.
Occasionally she would giggle or mutter something about not wanting to
get up yet and not having to get up to herself. Ultimately well past
noon she got out of her bed, she made a mental note of how comfortable
the bed was and told herself not to lay in it until she was sure she
wanted to sleep otherwise she wouldn&#39;t be able to get up.

The morning ritual of every woman took a long time and Lina prided
herself on being able to get ready faster then most other women. She
washed her face with casual grace invigorating her, she had always
liked this part of her morning she always felt so refreshed. Within
minuets she had stripped out of her bed clothes, and after a quick
check in the mirror to see how well she had been &#39;developing&#39; she
dressed in her daily outfit. She decided on leaving her sword there and
after some consideration took off her cape as well giving her less of
an unconformist appearance. In the mirror she noticed that it might be
a good idea to comb her hair, it was looking a bit &#39;wild&#39; but she
decided against that as well, it looked like rain today anyway.

She walked out of the inn and was immediately hit by the weather. No,
it was not windy or cold or anything. It was raining, a soft slightly
warm rain not the kind of thing that you would expect in the fall. She
loved the rain at times like this, it was like taking a shower with
your clothes on. She twirled in circles letting her self go in the
cleansing downpour. She walked down the street with a light smile on
her face just enjoying the beautiful feeling of the rain dancing on her
skin. Today would be a good day she thought to herself. She reflected
on what had already happened today, it wasn&#39;t much but it was indeed
turning out to be a good day. It would have kept being good if she
hadn&#39;t been so distracted and seen the pot hole in the street and
hadn&#39;t slipped into it and fallen on her butt.

She hurt a little but she wasn&#39;t going to let a little thing like this
bring her down, oh no. She got right on up and kept walking albeit
paying more attention to where she walks. She was passing a tavern when
she realized &quot;I haven&#39;t even eaten breakfast yet, what&#39;s wrong with
me!&quot; said as she walked into the dimly lit eatery. It wasn&#39;t the one
she ate at the night before. This one had a more seedy feel to it. Most
of it looked as though it had not been cleaned in ages and the men
sitting at the bar looked like they were permanent additions. She
wearily sat down at the table closest to the door, sure she had no
problem coming in here and eating, she did it all the time but usually
there were other people with her. The waiter a gruff unfriendly type
came over. His tall appearance and wide girth made him look like a
bandit, his shirt was covered in splotches of food and grease and his
smell made Lina wrinkle her nose. &quot;Can I help you&quot; he asked in a
surprisingly normal voice not befitting his size and appearance. &quot;Yeah,
I&#39;ll take one of those&quot; Lina said with a smile pointing at a display on
the far wall. &quot;You really want that little girly it really is a lot a
food&quot; he asked. Lina just nodded her head and smiled and the waiter
just walked away without another word.

Normally you would expect Lina to order item after item on a menu and
anything else might seem odd. But you see there was something special
about the meal she ordered. Besides it being more then enough for most
people if you finished it in under an hour it was free. Lina liked a
challenge even if it wasn&#39;t really a tough one. Time passes and the
next time we see Lina she has a visibly bulging stomach and is walking
though the double doors of the tavern. Inside we see a table absolutely
covered in plates and the waiter is jumping up and down yelling. At the
far end of the tavern we see the display on the wall and in the corner
a man is painting we see he just finished. He stands back and the
letters read &#39;limit one per customer.&#39;

Lina was quite happy with herself. Not only did she get more then
enough to eat but she didn&#39;t have to pay a single silver piece for it.
I wont be able to go back there tomorrow tough, they were kind of upset
oh well she thought to her self. Damn I&#39;m full I think that I&#39;ll go
back to my inn and take a break. As she walked she inhaled the
refreshing fragrance of newly fallen rain still in the air. The sun had
peeked from beyond the clouds bathing everything in its warming pure
light. She sat down on a nearby bench to enjoy the atmosphere. She
watched as kids played in the puddles with there expressions showing
not a care in the world. A smile formed on her face as she thought
about having kids of her own. Sure they would be a hassle, she wasn&#39;t
going to delude herself to believe otherwise but it was bound to be an
adventure different from any she had before. She sighed and pushed
herself up from her bench and continued her advance toward the inn.

As she was just about to enter the inn she paused. Do I really want to
go back so soon, I would just sit around and I don&#39;t really feel like
that right now, but then again there is that bed, ohhh....so
comfortable. She almost drooled as she remembered the just how
comfortable that bed was. After some internal conflict she did decided
on heading up stairs. Her room was in immaculate condition, the maid
had made the bed and picked up her things arranging them in the corner
of her room. She took off her boots and gloves at the door and made a
bee line for the bed. On her way she also ditched her shoulder guards
and her belt. Clad in only the slimmest remnants of her original outfit
she flopped her body down on the bed. She laid there enjoying the
immense comfort for several minutes, just laying there thinking.
Thinking about the past, the present, and the future. She had never
felt so relaxed she let her troubles drift away as she sailed off to
sleep.

She awoke with a start, sweat causing the sheets to cling to her body.
&quot;Oh gods that was a strange dream....&quot; she said to herself visibly
shaking. &quot;In the dream I....I enjoyed it, what kind of a sicko am I,
and with Amelia!&quot; she shuttered as she let the last part out. She
looked out the window, her curtains were drawn partially and she could
see that it was black outside the moon was already high in the sky, and
the moon, this time, was a full one. She gazed out wistfully at the
stars letting there soft, beautiful glow hypnotize her and relax her.
She let her mind drift back to her dream. Sure there were some things
wrong with it but it was a good dream at the time. It did sort of turn
me on weather I would like to admit it or not.

When I really think about it I&#39;ve always sort of been turned on by
girls. She quickly cast a light spell to remedy the darkness before she
continued her train of thought. First there was Naga then some of the
other girls I meet on my quests now Amelia is in one of my sick
fantasies, for god sakes I&#39;ve even dreamt about my sister! She finished
the last part shedding a single tear. By the gods what the hell is
wrong with me........ She sat there in silence for several minuets
simply starring at the wall. Is that why I never really feel as happy
as I used to be, could I be repressing my true self? I have to find
out....

She laid there and welcomed every thought and impulse into her brain.
It started off slowly, she imagined herself in a inn much like the one
she had stayed at three nights previous before Amelia left on her own
for a few days. She was starring out the window when she heard the
creek of the floor boards, the first floor board when you walked in the
room always creaked, she remembered that and tried to avoid it during
her stay there but her hearing it could only mean someone was coming
into her room. She turned around slowly wondering who it could be,
standing in the doorway we see Amelia. &quot;Amelia what are you doing
here?&quot; but Lina knew what she was doing there, Lina knew that this was
all in her mind and she knew now that she liked girls. How could I not
like Amelia, her firm round but, and her breasts, there bigger then
mine, and she looks so cute! &quot;I wanted to tell you something Miss.
Lina&quot; Lina looked at her closely for a second &quot;Go ahead Amelia you know
you can tell me anything.&quot; Amelia paused before continuing &quot;Its just
that after all of this time traveling with you I think.....I think
that....well....I might be becoming attracted to you.....&quot; she finished
by turning shyly to the side and blushing a bit.

Attracted to me? Lina felt butterfly&#39;s gather in her stomach, she felt
like she was walking on cloud nine and the sky was the limit all at
once it was pure euphoria. Then she realized this was all in her mind
and fell from the heights of greatness to the pits of depression in one
fell swoop. What the heck if this is a dream hopefully it would make
her happy and she&#39;d be dammed if she was gonna waste it. &quot;Amelia?&quot; Lina
asked her voice quivering and her heart beat quickening. &quot;Yes, what is
it Miss. Lina?&quot; Amelia asked her own voice betraying her. &quot;I think that
I (gulp)...I love you Amelia&quot; Lina finished &quot;Oh I love you too Miss.
Lina.&quot; With that Amelia tackled Lina onto the bed with a hug. Emotions
were running high for the both of them and they were stripped of there
clothing in almost no time.

Lina was controlled by instincts to primitive to comprehend. Her tongue
was in Amelia&#39;s mouth and her hands teasing Amelia&#39;s nipples within
moments. Lina felt like she was going wild, like she was a white hot
fire she was everything she felt she was missing in life, and this one
act was fulfilling her. Amelia&#39;s hands were pushing Lina&#39;s shoulders
firmly into the bed as Amelia ground there mounds together relishing
the feeling. The two of them were moving together like they had been
made for one another and the expressions on the duo&#39;s faces were
nothing short of pure bliss.

Meanwhile in the real world Lina&#39;s hands were down inside her
underwear. Both hands were going at it and it looked like she was
having sex with some invisible man. Her body was jumping up and down
sometimes leaving the bed in areas all together. She was sweating, her
teeth clenched, and her expression ravenous. She was letting out high
pitched squeals of delight and animalistic moans all at once. To Lina
it was as if she was at heavens doors no magic, no nothing could
compare to what she was feeling right now and it was only getting
better.

Lina and Amelia&#39;s pace was picking up and becoming more uncoordinated
as the pleasure built. Soon they were screaming out each other&#39;s names
at the top of their lungs. Lina&#39;s hips were bucking like mad and it was
hard to follow the movements but with one ear splitting scream Lina
Inverse experienced her first orgasm of her lifetime one that would be
heard throughout the astral plane. She opened her eyes to find her
sheets soaked and her pants ruined and ripped. She looked at her finger
and popped it in her mouth, wow I taste good she thought to herself
before she fell asleep from exhaustion.

The next day went as you would usually expect. Wake up, get dressed,
eat, etc. It just wasn&#39;t the same for Lina however. That little episode
the night before had stirred some powerful emotions within her and they
were keeping her on edge. By the beginning of the next day she had
decided to head to the meeting place a day earlier then she originally
intended. Sure, no one would be there she thought to herself but they
would start arriving soon. She had no idea when she would see Amelia
and just the thought of it made Lina&#39;s stomach do summersaults.

She booked a room at an inn near the center of the town and spent the
remainder of the day mulling around enjoying the small town&#39;s
historical beauty. Although the town was small they had a surprisingly
large number of beautifully designed buildings. Lina had learned to
appreciate beautiful architecture but that did not mean that she had
any reservations about destroying it. The day was beginning to wind
down and the sun was already well on its way to sitting, Lina had just
bought herself an ice cream cone and was walking carefree through the
center of town square. Her thoughts had drifted from those that
previously concerned her earlier, now the only thing she wanted to do
was go to her new inn and relax, but Lina saw something that made her
blood run cold.......&quot;Amelia....&quot;

She said the name softly to herself as she felt her blood turn to ice.
From her perspective it was as if Amelia was moving in slow motion, as
a matter of fact everything slowed down for Lina. She could hear her
every heart beat, the ice cream cone she had bought for herself dropped
from her hand and she could feel goosebumps rising on her arms. Amelia
had spotted her and was heading toward her, a big smile coming to
Amelia&#39;s lips. Lina&#39;s breath was coming in short gasps, she was so
nervous! She forced herself to calm down but it only worked part way.
By the time Amelia reached Lina she was still quite nervous. &quot;Hey Miss.
Lina&quot; Amelia said with glee.

&quot;Hey there Amelia (nervous laugh) a little early aint ya&quot; Lina said
managing to keep most of her nervousness out of her voice. She had
forced herself almost back to normal, it had taken all of her will
power but she did it. She couldn&#39;t stop starring at Amelia, she had to
keep tearing her eyes away from her chest. She had never felt like this
in all of her life, visions of her fantasy were flooding back to her,
she was about to lose control again when....... &quot;Hey Miss. Lina, do you
have an inn yet?&quot; Lina was at least half shocked back to reality by
this, she pointed limply toward her inn which was well within her
vision. &quot;That&#39;s great Miss. Lina I wonder if they have any extra rooms?
I&#39;m going to go check.&quot;

&quot;Good she&#39;s gone...&quot;Lina said in relief but the relief was also
accompanied by a wash of emotional pain. Jeez, how could I get like
this and in just that short period of time. I&#39;m like some kind of love
sick puppy dog, god this has got me all emotional and stuff. I feel
like I&#39;m going to cry........I gotta do something about this. I think
that I&#39;ll go back to my room and rest for a while.

Lina wearily headed back to the room. It wasn&#39;t a bad room she thought
to herself, not as good as her last one but still not to shabby. She
moved over to the bed and sat down on it starring out the window. She
took off her boots and rubbed her sore feet. The sun outside was now
completely down, plunging the small town into all but darkness with
only scattered lamps on the street corners and in windows to light the
cold fall night. I think that I&#39;ll call it a day, wow this love thing
can really be draining, I better.....her thoughts trailed off as she
heard the door creak as it opened. Now who could that be she thought as
she started to turn around, it better not be any bandits, I&#39;m not in
the mood.

It was not a group of bandits, or a demon, or any of a number of things
that would cause her little or no trouble. It was Amelia and that to
Lina was far worse then any demon could ever be. &quot;Miss. Lina the inn
keeper said that they were out of rooms for the night......could I stay
in here with you?&quot; Amelia asked with confidence, she usually stayed in
the same room with Miss. Lina asking was just a formality. Or so she
thought, &quot;No!&quot; was Lina&#39;s unexpectedly sharp response. Amelia was
shocked, what was going on, but Lina had been acting kind of strange
ever since they had met up. Maybe it was time to get to the bottom of
this.

&quot;Lina, I have something to ask you, and be honest, why are you acting
so strange, Miss. Lina. We&#39;ve know each other for over a year, why are
you acting like this?&quot; Amelia&#39;s question had been anticipated by Lina,
she knew she was shutting Amelia out, that was her intention, but it
did make her feel bad to do this to her friend, maybe someone who was
more then a friend. Lina had always seen herself as an honest person at
least when dealing with her friends, she also never backed down from a
fight. But how would Miss. Love and Justice react to the fact that one
of her best friends might be in love with her? Only one way to find
out, &quot;Amelia, I have something that I need to tell you, now promise me
you&#39;ll hear me out.....&quot;
