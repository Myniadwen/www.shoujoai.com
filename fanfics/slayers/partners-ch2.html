<h1>Lina and Naga: Partners (part 2 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/riva.html">Riva</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../slayers/partners-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>	It was nightfall by the time they reached a suitable clearing
in the woods.  They had made good time despite two interruptions by
bandits and brigands, and they were even 47 gold pieces and three
jugs of ale wealthier from the exchanges.
	Lina sat quietly by the fire, staring blankly into the
flames.  On the other side of the flames, Naga slept loudly, cradling
an empty one of the liberated jugs of ale.  She had first watch, but
she doubted that Naga could be woken to take the second, third or
fourth.
	The flames illuminated her hair, staining her curls like the
ruby set upon Naga&#39;s circlet.  Lina closed her eyes and sighed.  Naga
never seemed to have any problems, Naga never seemed to have any
cares or worries, responsibilities or anything.  Naga didn&#39;t seem to
have any of her problems.
	Naga didn&#39;t have a sister who was good at everything.  Naga
didn&#39;t have a sister who barely had to try to completely out perform
her little sister.  Naga&#39;s sister was the sweet heart of everybody,
always the center of attention.
	Lina&#39;s eyes fell to her chest.	Or lack of it.	Naga didn&#39;t
have...well, actually, she did, and lots of them, Lina thought to
herself as her eyes drifted from Naga&#39;s chest to the sleeping
sorceress&#39; face.  Naga was darkly beautiful in the glow of the fire,
Lina had to admit.  Her long black hair, so dark that it was
almost blue was a stark contrast to the flame-haired girl.  Her limbs
were long and sleek, like a jungle cat&#39;s.  Naga had the face of a
woman compared to her own, girlish features of big eyes and a snub
nose.
	She found her eyes drawn back to Naga&#39;s chest, rhythmically
rising with each breath.  They were, for lack of another word, big. 
But other than that, they were round, perfectly spherical and smooth.
They were what she would wish for, should she ever manage to capture a
djinni one day.
	A frown crossed Lina&#39;s lips, and she tore her eyes away from
Naga&#39;s breasts, cursing herself for blatantly ogling them.  She
looked down to her own chest then, tracing the shallow curve of her
right breast with her eyes.
	One day, she thought to herself.  One day.
