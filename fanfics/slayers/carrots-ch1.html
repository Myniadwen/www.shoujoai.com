<pre>&quot;Ten orders of chicken over here!&quot; 

Lina happily shouted over to the waiter. She, along with Gourry, 
Amelia, Zelgadis, and Slyphie, was on her way to Sairagg to help 
restore the ruined city. They had stopped at an inn that was set up 
nearby for travelers on their way to Sairagg that didn&#39;t know the city 
had been destroyed yet so they could eat, rest, and buy more supplies 
before returning home. Lina&#39;s job was fairly easy, she was being paid 
to clear out bandits that occupied the area. The others were also paid 
by the elders to flush out beasts and outlaws.

*****

As soon as the waiter sat their meals on the table Lina and Gourry 
immediately grabbed a chicken and started tearing into them. 

&quot;You know... I don&#39;t think I&#146;ll ever get used to this...&quot; Zelgadis 
said while watching the two already finish a chicken each and grab 
another without even slowing down. The only pause in their gorging 
came when Sylphiel stood up and pushed her chair in. 

Lina looked up at her and asked, &quot;Where are you going so soon?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m just going to step outside for a few minutes, it&#39;s been a while 
since I&#146;ve been home.&quot; 

The young priestess also wanted to go outside because Lina and 
Gourry&#39;s eating habits were causing the rest of the inn&#39;s customers to 
stare at their table, but decided to leave that out. 

As she walked out the door Lina stopped eating and gazed down for a 
moment. Gourry saw this and reached for the chicken leg left on her 
plate, only to get punched in the nose and fall over in his chair for 
his trouble.

*****

Sylphiel was standing about thirty feet from the inn looking over at 
the ruins that used to be her hometown before it was destroyed in the 
battle against Rezo&#39;s copy. 

It was starting to get dark out so she decided she would return to her 
room soon. Before she could, her thought was interrupted by footsteps 
closing in from behind. Sylphiel turned around to see a few shady 
looking guys walk up to her.

&quot;All alone, are you? Why don&#39;t you come with us, we&#39;ll show you a good 
time.&quot; 

Sylphiel could easily tell that the two men in front of her were 
bandits. She really didn&#39;t want to find out what they had in mind for 
her, so she tried to politely refuse.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but my friends are waiting for me back at the inn.&quot; As she 
tried to walk around them, they stepped in front of her. 

&quot;I don&#39;t think you understand&quot; the other guy said. &quot;In fact, I insist 
you come with us.&quot; The first bandit reached out and tried to grab her 
arm, but Sylphiel managed to jump a few feet out of reach. &quot;I&#39;m 
warning you! Don&#39;t come near me!&quot; She yelled as she put her arms in 
the position to cast a flare arrow.

*****

The first villain just smiled and took a step forward, leaving the 
healer with no choice but to attack. 

&quot;Flare...!&quot; she called out as fire gathered in the hand she had drawn 
back. &quot;Arrow!&quot; 

The fire took the shape of a carrot and slowly floated towards the two 
bandits, it flickered out inches in front of them. 

They just looked at the poor girl in confusion for a few seconds 
before responding.

&quot;AAAAHAHAHAHA!! What was that?!&quot; 

Another of the bandits managed to choke out a comment around braying 
laughs.

&quot;This girl&#39;s pretty funny, we have to take her with us!&quot; This time 
they get a good grip on her. 

&quot;No! Please!&quot; Sylphiel tried to pull away but the guy holding her 
outweighed her badly. 

Tears were starting to form in her eyes as she was panicking. The man 
holding her suddenly loosened his grip and dropped to his knees, 
falling to the ground. 

The other bandit quickly turned around to see Lina standing there 
holding a rock in her hand. 

&quot;Oh my god! He&#39;s bleeding!! I can&#39;t believe you actually...!&quot; 

The bandit was cut short by Lina smacking the rock on his forehead, 
dropping him like the other. 

&quot;They just don&#39;t make them like they used to...&quot; Lina said as she 
looked down at the twitching duo.

*****

She noticed that tears were running down Sylphiel&#39;s face and she was 
shaking a little. &quot;It wasn&#39;t THAT scary, was it? Come on... I saw your 
flare over here and almost fell over.&quot;

The two look at each other and giggled as they recalled it. 

&quot;Thank you, Lina-san.&quot;

&quot;Anytime! Now lets go back inside&quot; Back at their table, Lina was 
bragging to the others about how she beat up five bandits and saved 
her friend. Sylphiel decided not to argue about the details and just 
wondered how she could do something nice to repay Lina.

*****

After a few hours of chatting with their friends they decide to go to 
their rooms. Since the place was short on rooms for that night, Lina 
and Sylphiel shared a room. Zelgadis and Amelia also shared a room. 

As soon as the door was closed behind them, Lina kicked off her boots 
and stripped down to her underwear. As she was climbing into the bed, 
however, she noticed Sylphiel had only taken her boots off. 

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re going to sleep in that!&quot; 

Sylphiel just blushed saying &quot;I&#39;ll be fine in this.&quot; 

&quot;This place is too warm to sleep in your clothes, you&#39;ll be up all 
night! And since there&#39;s only one bed here I don&#39;t want to deal with 
that.&quot;

Lina walked over to her and started to pull her shirt off. &quot;Eek! 
Lina-san... I...&quot; 

Before Sylphiel could explain her embarrassment, Zelgadis entered to 
add to it. &quot;Could you two keep it down? Peo...ple... are...&quot;

*****

The room was silent for a moment while Zelgadis stood there in shock 
and the two girls stood there with Lina holding some of her friend&#39;s 
clothes. 

&quot;Zel!&quot; Anger filled Lina&#39;s voice as she dropped the clothes and held 
her hands a foot apart, drawing them back. &quot;Dragon...!&quot; 

This broke the tension as Zelgadis and Sylphiel both realized what was 
about to happen. 

&quot;No! Nnnooooo!!&quot; was all Zelgadis cared to add. 

Sylphiel grabbed Lina&#39;s wrists saying, &quot;Don&#39;t do it! You&#39;ll blow this 
whole place up!&quot; 

The power gathered in her hands faded as Lina decided not to blast all 
her friends into orbit. 

Realizing that this was his chance to leave Zelgadis promptly said 
&quot;Pardon my intrusion.&quot; and left, closing the door behind him. Sylphiel 
thought it would be best to dress down like Lina and get to sleep 
quickly to avoid any more trouble. The rest of the night passed by 
without problems. 

*****

The next morning Lina slowly opened her eyes. She was about to get out 
of bed when she noticed Sylphiel was cuddled up next to her with her 
arms wrapped around the other girl. 

&quot;Awww... that&#39;s so cute!&quot; Lina thought to herself. She spent the next 
few minutes thinking about how she was always so nice to her. &quot;Because 
of last night Zelgadis probably got the wrong idea... he must think 
we&#39;re having a relationship...&quot; 

The thought of that didn&#39;t bother her like she thought it would, Lina 
was never interested girls before, but she didn&#39;t dislike the idea of 
her and Sylphiel being a couple. Lina looked at her sleeping friend 
and thought of how she would feel about it. 

The smile on Lina&#39;s face quickly turned to a look of annoyance when 
she heard Sylphiel moan out &quot;Mmmm... Gourry&quot; &quot;Of course...&quot; thought 
Lina. &quot;She still likes that baka...&quot;

Sylphiel giggled saying &quot;Oh no... not there... Gourry-sama...&quot; Lina 
had a funny idea, she sat up and rolled Sylphiel on her back. Then she 
pinned her down by the shoulders while preparing to speak.

*****

&quot;Do you love me darling?&quot; Lina asked in a deepened voice, trying to 
match Gourrys. 

&quot;Yes... I love you&quot; Sylphiel mumbled as her eyes started to open. &quot;I 
truly love you, I...&quot; 

Sylphiel was now awake to see Lina smiling down at her. &quot;...love... 
you...&quot; Sylphiel&#39;s face turned a bright shade of red as she realized 
what she was doing. &quot;Um... hello?&quot; was all she could say.

&quot;Haha, that&#39;ll teach you to watch what you dream around me!&quot; &quot;Oh, I&#146;m 
so sorry Lina-san! I just... I...&quot; 

Lina stopped her from continuing, wondering if what she was about to 
ask was wise. 

&quot;Why Gourry? How do you feel about me?&quot; Sylphiel looked at Lina in 
surprise. 

&quot;Lina...&quot; The two talked for a while before going to the bathing area. 
Sylphiel didn&#39;t have anything against Lina, but was still wondering if 
they really should become lovers.

*****

After talking for a while, conversation drifted to the events of last 
night. 

&quot;Lina? When you saved me last night, why were you outside? I thought 
it would be a while before you finished dinner.&quot; 

Lina just laughed and said,

&quot;I knew someone like you would get attacked. I guess I was worried 
about you.&quot; 

Sylphiel looked at Lina for a minute, then walks up embracing her. 

&quot;Lina, I think I do want to be with you.&quot; Lina leans forward and 
kisses Sylphiel gently, the two remain there for a few seconds when 
Amelia walks in, notices, and dropped the bucket and cloth she was 
carrying.

The two break their kiss and look over to the young princess, Lina 
thinking &quot;What ever happened to knocking?&quot; while Sylphiel fainted into 
the water.

*****

Later, after waking Sylphiel, the group was sitting at their table. It 
was a quiet breakfast, as everyone was wondering how to tell Gourry 
about this without hurting him. 

&quot;Gourry... I need to tell you...&quot; Lina wasn&#39;t looking forward to this. 

&quot;Oh?&quot; replied Gourry 

&quot;Me and Sylphiel... are in love, so...&quot; 

Gourry smiles saying &quot;Hey, that&#39;s great news! Congratulations.&quot; 

&quot;What?!&quot; started Lina &quot;This doesn&#39;t bother you?!&quot; 

Looking confused, Gourry said &quot;Why would it, I&#39;ll still be your 
bodyguard forever.&quot; 

Lina face vaulted right to the floor at that comment, while the others 
looked slightly amused. &quot;You too Sylphiel!&quot; Gourry added. 

&quot;He doesn&#39;t really get it...&quot; Zelgadis said while sipping his drink.

 Lina stood up and walked up to Gourry, patting him on the back. 
&quot;You&#39;re a great guy, don&#39;t ever change, okay?&quot;  

With that said, Lina looked forward to the rest of the day.
