<h1>Her (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/metallium.html">Elizabeth Metallium</a><br> </h2>
<P>She is the kind of person you can't help but
love. I wonder what it would be like, to draw 
people to yourself like that...?

<P>I don't suppose it matters; I don't really <I>want</i>
to draw others like she does, just a select few.

<P>Like her.

<P>It was a stunning revelation, the moment that I 
realised the truth.  It went against all the plans 
I'd had, against even what I thought about myself.  
I'm not entirely sure <I>how</i> it happened, but it did.  
When I saw her lying on the ground, bleeding, I knew 
with certainity that I loved her.
