<h1>Mirror (part 10 of 28)</h1>

<a href="../slayers/mirror-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>The room at the top of the tower was crowded, filled
with many arcane items. Rare books sat in various book
cases, bubbling vials and noxious chemicals were set
up on different tables and various exotic beasts were
stuffed all around the room. The water in the shallow
pool gleamed, the image of the three women walking
away from the town crystal clear. The fiery redhead,
the petite black haired girl and the taller warrior,
all talking animatedly.

A hand slammed down, splashing liquid about as the
woman snarled, &quot;Damn them!&quot; She turned away from the
scrying pool and walked away, her velvet cloak
swirling around her. The tall blonde&#39;s eyes were
narrowed irritably, her beautiful face twisted in a
fierce scowl. The silken gown that she wore hugged her
generously proportioned body, the nearly transparent
material revealing much of her physical charms.

&quot;Gwenyth,&quot; the blonde yelled out irritably.

The pink haired younger girl appeared almost as soon
as she called, the little points on her ears showing
that she was at least part elven. &quot;Yes, Mistress
Hectate?&quot; Gwenyth asked as she smoothly fell into step
beside the taller woman.

&quot;What news of the bandits?&quot; Hectate coldly asked as
they took the stone steps leading down from the tower,
the torches that were hanging on the walls igniting as
they neared then promptly going out once they passed
by.

&quot;Completely scattered, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; Gwenyth admitted,
&quot;it seems that Inverse and Naga have put the fear of
the gods into them.&quot;

&quot;So who decided to send the Goblins after them?&quot;
Hectate scowled, angry at the waste of a resource,
even one as limited as those vermin.

&quot;Lord Halcyon,&quot; Gwenyth answered her promptly, &quot;he
hoped that the pair might have been weakened enough
that the goblins could succeed.&quot; They entered the next
level down, striding along the stone floor and
ignoring the ornate tapestries hanging on the walls.

Hectate thought for a moment, her expression softening
a bit. &quot;Against a normal foe he might have been
right,&quot; she admitted, &quot;but not this trio.&quot;

&quot;Should I move some of our other forces to intercept
them?&quot; Gwenyth asked respectfully, opening the door
for her lady.

Hectate shook her head no as she entered her
bedchamber, calmly opening her robe to let it puddle
to the ground around her feet. Gwenyth tried to look
away as her mistress changed clothes, but she couldn&#39;t
resist sneaking a few looks. Hectate was so beautiful,
a perfection that was created as much by magical
alterations than the gifts of the flesh, but despite
knowing all of that Gwenyth was drawn to her like a
moth to a flame.

The bedchamber carried a faint rose scent, a sweetness
that hung in the air. The great bed was twice as large
as any that Gwenyth had ever seen, the sheets made
from the finest imported silk. Glossy wood, silver and
gold shone all around the room, furnishings and
decorations crafted by the very best artisans of many
kingdoms. It suited it&#39;s mistress well, a place of
beauty that served as a frame to the lovely lady who
lived there.

&quot;Just keep an wary eye on them,&quot; Hectate crisply
instructed as she pulled the dress on, the long white
gown looking oddly chaste on her beautiful form. &quot;I
want to know what they&#39;ll do as soon as possible,&quot; she
added.

&quot;Of course, Mistress,&quot; Gwenyth bowed, &quot;and what of
our... guest?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll see to her,&quot; Hectate answered, &quot;go, begin your
tasks.&quot;

Gwenyth bowed once again then the smaller woman strode
from the room. Hectate left soon after, taking another
set of stairs down into chilled air. Below the ground
the air in the keep was moist, a sensation unpleasant
on the skin. Carrying a torch she strode the dark
hallways, finally unlocking a heavy iron door and
going inside.

Unlike the rest of the keep this room was plain,
almost bare. A small bed was pushed against the
corner, a old wooden table and chair sitting in the
center of the room. Only a single wax candle provided
some light, illuminating the woman who lay on the bed
silently.

Her glossy black mane flowed around her body as she
rose with dignity, fixing Hectate with a glare that
would have killed a lesser woman. Her leather garb was
scanty, merely a bikini top and bottom but she seemed
quite comfortable in that clothing. The oddest thing
was the simple leather collar she wore, seemingly
without buckles or other means of opening it. She met
Hectate&#39;s gaze as she sat in the chair then quite
surprisingly, she smiled.

&quot;They escaped your trap, didn&#39;t they?&quot; Naga the White
Serpent asked.

Hectate clenched her jaw. &quot;Indeed,&quot; she admitted as
she studied her captive. &quot;Where do you think they&#39;re
going?&quot;

&quot;Maybe Lina is returning home,&quot; Naga said with a
impish little smile, &quot;she just loves going to see her
big sister.&quot;

Hectate rolled her eyes, knowing that was a lie. &quot;You
could just cooperate,&quot; she said with a sigh, &quot;I bear
you no ill will, sorceress.&quot;

Naga reached up to touch the collar that bound her as
firmly as any chains as she answered, &quot;Then you have a
very strange way of showing it.&quot; She studied Hectate a
moment before adding, &quot;It&#39;s all about that prophecy
you told me about, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Hectate ground her teeth together, &quot;Yes.&quot;

Her family had a tradition, one going back for many
generations. A seer was summoned at each child&#39;s
birth, taking a glimpse into the future to see what
glory might await the child in the years ahead. But in
Hectate&#39;s case it wasn&#39;t a lovely future that awaited
her, only doom.

&quot;The White Serpent shall claim her soul,

Break her will and lay her low.&quot;

Those words had haunted Hectate once her family had
determined that she was old enough to hear them. She
studied the beasts of the world, both magical and
mundane, frantically looking for the creature that
might defeat her even as she trained in magic. Finally
she some of heard the tales of a sorceress and
adventurer, one that called herself Naga the White
Serpent, and knew in her soul this was the one
prophecy spoke of.

Capturing her was surprisingly easy, actually. Hectate
had sent a few of her servants to a bar she frequented
to ply Naga with drink, then drug her final mug of
ale. They had brought the sleeping woman here, where
Hectate had placed the leather collar and enchantments
over Naga, binding her so that the woman could do
Hectate no harm. Once Naga had awoke there was some
trouble, any servant who ventured inside was promptly
beaten up, but eventually Naga calmed down enough to
know she couldn&#39;t escape this situation on her own.

&quot;You do realize it could be a self fulfilling
prophecy, correct?&quot; Naga asked, leaning forward to
rest her arms on the table.

Hectate nodded glumly, pacing the small room. &quot;And now
there&#39;s that damn shadow twin of yours,&quot; she grumbled
irritably.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I and my diminutive former business
partner ever expected them to survive,&quot; Naga noted,
&quot;I&#39;m rather impressed.&quot;

Hectate turned to look at her, &quot;What connection does
this Amelia have to you, anyway?&quot; She scowled, &quot;The
woman hasn&#39;t left your doppelganger and Lina&#39;s side
since she met them.&quot;

&quot;All I know are the same stories you do,&quot; Naga
shrugged, &quot;that Amelia the princess of Saillune was a
companion of Lina and her allies in several great
quests.&quot;

&quot;And a power in her own right,&quot; Hectate noted, &quot;with
the strength of a crown behind her.&quot; She paused, eyes
widening, &quot;That&#39;s where they&#39;re going!&quot;

&quot;Knowing Lina she&#39;s hoping for a free meal,&quot; Naga
offered with a impish smile.

Hectate turned away to walk to the door, &quot;Thank you
for your assistance, Lady Naga.&quot; She turned back to
smile slightly, &quot;I find I enjoy our talks.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so glad,&quot; Naga muttered sarcastically as Hectate
left.

Hectate strode down the hall, her slippers barely
making a sound on the cool stone floor. &quot;Gwenyth,&quot; the
tall blonde cried as she walked up the stairs.

&quot;Mistress,&quot; the pink haired girl waited for her at the
doorway, Gwenyth holding a mug of the warmed cider
that Hectate preferred.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Hectate took it and drank deep, savoring
the taste, then she confidently said, &quot;Naga and her
companions are headed for Saillune.&quot;

Gwenyth took the cup from her and they fell into step
down the hall. &quot;Should I dispatch agents to intercept
them?&quot; she asked.

&quot;No, just instruct our people to keep an eye on them,&quot;
Hectate said before adding wryly. &quot;I have no wish to
anger a kingdom as strong as Saillune.&quot;

&quot;It will be done,&quot; Gwenyth bowed slightly.

&quot;Include a bottle of good wine with Naga&#39;s dinner
tonight,&quot; Hectate added with a slight smile, &quot;I would
not have realized without speaking to her.&quot;

Gwenyth looked up at Hectate thoughtfully, &quot;You like
her, Mistress?&quot;

Hectate blinked, her steps faltering just a moment.
&quot;Yes, I think I do.&quot;</pre>
