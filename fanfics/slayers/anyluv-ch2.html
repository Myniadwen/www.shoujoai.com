<h1>I Would Do Anything for Love (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dodgerk.html">Dodger K Diamond</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../slayers/anyluv-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The next day, Dana meets up with Filia and Zelgadis near the wagon. 
Zelgadis is placing Nagha gentle down in the back.

&quot;How did you sleep, my love?&quot; Filia asks Dana before they kiss.

&quot;Well as can be expected, my sweet!&quot;

&quot;We are ready when you ladies are!&quot; Zelgadis remarks.

&quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; Filia replies.

Later on that day, Dana is leading the wagon as Zelgadis scouts a head 
for danger. Filia is nursing Nagha back to health by placing a damp 
cloth on her forehead. The sun begins to set beyond the horizon. The 
wind begins to get stronger as day turns to night. Zelgadis walks back 
to the wagon.

&quot;I found a spot to camp for the night. It is about a half a mile up.&quot; 
Zelgadis replies.

&quot;Excellent!&quot; Dana remarks. &quot;The horse is starting to get tired. Plus, 
it will be good to stretch our legs.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot; Filia says from the back. &quot;I will start on dinner then.&quot;

15 minutes later, Filia is lifting Nagha out of the back of the wagon. 
Dana is taking care of the horse. And Zelgadis is gathering firewood 
and game for the meal. Filia lays Nagha down on the ground besides her 
as she start- chopping vegetables while softly singing. Soon Zelgadis 
returns with the firewood and several small game animals. Filia starts 
to make a stew out of the ingredients.

&quot;So,&quot; Dana asks. &quot;How long do you think she was adventuring for?&quot;

&quot;From the stories that I heard, several years now.&quot; Zelgadis answers 
understanding she is talking about Nagha.

&quot;We can only image the things she has seen.&quot; Filia exclaims.

Squishie was the lost now for what seemed like days. He sees a bright 
light in front of him. He notices as he gets closer a small campsite. 
Three women are laying down on the ground asleep next to a fire. A 
humanoid man is awake keeping guard over them. Squishie nervously 
begins to make his way towards the fire.

&quot;Halt!&quot; The humanoid man says. &quot;Who goes there?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t hurt me!&quot; Squishie says in fear. &quot;I just wanted to share your 
fire.&quot;

&quot;You can talk human speech? I thought slimes never spoke.&quot; The man 
replies in disbelief.

&quot;That is a very stereotypical oversight that humans have of my kind. 
We slimes are just as intelligent as you humans are. We have our own 
society too but I won&#39;t bore you with the details.&quot; He replies.

&quot;Go ahead then.&quot;

&quot;Thank you kind, sir.&quot; Squishie says as he hops over closer to the 
fire.

&quot;What is your name?&quot; Zelgadis asks.

&quot;I am known amongst my friends as Squishie. And you are?&quot;

&quot;Zelgadis. Zelgadis Greywords.&quot;

&quot;Who are your lovely companions?&quot;

&quot;The blond haired lady is Filia Ul Copt. The Black-bluish haired lady 
is Nagha Lenah Telos Sayrun. And the purplish-white haired lady is 
Dana Lords. What are you doing out here?&quot;

&quot;My village was attacked and my people were killed. I was lucky to be 
alive. I decided to make my way towards town so I could find some food 
but I got lost along the way.&quot; &quot;We have some extra stew if you want 
some.&quot;

&quot;No thanks. We slimes can&#39;t digest meat. You don&#39;t have any fruit on 
you by any chance, won&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;I can find you some.&quot; Zelgadis replies as he walks into the woods.

10 minutes later, Zelgadis returns with three large red apples. 
Squishie begins to chow down on them. After he is done, Zelgadis asks 
Squishie more questions. &quot;What do you plan to do now?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know. I lost everything and everyone I ever knew and cared 
about. My whole world is dead to me now. I need somewhere to be and 
something to believe in.&quot; Squishie says depressed.

&quot;Well&quot; Zelgadis clears his throat. &quot;You can join us if you want.&quot;

&quot;Really? You mean it?&quot; Squishie says with excitement. &quot;Thank you. 
Thank you very much.&quot;

The next day, Dana awakes near a sleeping slime. It wakes up a moment 
later.

&quot;Good Morning!&quot; The slime replies.

&quot;Um? Good morning. Who are you?&quot;

&quot;I am Squishie the slime. I will be traveling with you.&quot;

&quot;Alright.&quot; Dana responds as she wakes up Filia with a soft kiss on the 
cheek.

&quot;Ohh! I get it.&quot; Squishie replies. &quot;You&#39;re gay!&quot;

Filia and Dana both blush.

&quot;Squishie!&quot; Zelgadis shouts. &quot;That was rude.&quot;

&quot;But it is the truth.&quot; The slime proclaims. &quot;I don&#39;t mean to offend. 
It is just the first time I have seen anything like this.&quot;

&quot;You speak human quite well, Mr. Slime.&quot; Filia states.

&quot;Thank you, Miss Filia. You and Miss Dana make a lovely couple. I am 
sorry if I embeared you before. I didn&#39;t mean to.&quot;

&quot;Apologies excepted.&quot;

&quot;Will Miss Nagha be waking up soon too?&quot; The slime asks.

&quot;Not yet I&#39;m afraid. A monster attacked her and she is still in a 
coma. She should wake up tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; He replies. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind me asking, why do you smell like 
a golden dragon?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s amazing!&quot; Filia says in total surprise. &quot;Yes, I am a golden 
dragon in fact.&quot; &quot;Then Miss Dana is ..I see.&quot; Squishie stops himself.

&quot;Dana is what?&quot; Filia asks.

&quot;She is . your lover. I was just kidding.&quot; Squishie says as Dana and 
Zelgadis face fall. &quot;Slime humor, never mind.&quot;

&quot;If everyone is ready, we should get back on the road.&quot; Zelgadis says 
to change the subject.

Hours later, Zelgadis is scouting again, Dana is leading the wagon, 
and Filia is taking care of Nagha in the back of the wagon. Squishie 
is sitting in the back besides her.

&quot;How long have you and Dana known each other?&quot; Squishie asks.

&quot;About one week now; however, it feels like longer than that.&quot;

&quot;It is probably longer than you realize.&quot; Squishie mumbles.

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; Filia asks.

&quot;You probably knew each other in a previous life, I said.&quot;

&quot;Maybe you&#39;re right. I feel that way too.&quot; She says with joy.

&quot;You said Nagha was attacked by a monster but that is not true. I 
smell the faint odor of a demon on her.&quot; Squishie states.

&quot;Really? What makes you think that?&quot; Filia asks.

&quot;We slimes have an enhanced sense of smell. I can identify other races 
by their odor alone.&quot;

&quot;Oh, really?&quot; Filia wonders.

The next hour, Squishie joins Dana at the front of the wagon.

&quot;I know who and what you really are, Dana.&quot; Squishie states. &quot;We have 
met before.&quot;

&quot;How old are you?&quot; Dana asks. &quot;A thousand years as of yesterday.&quot;

&quot;If you wish to remain alive, you will keep that a secret.&quot; Dana 
threatens quietly.

&quot;Not to worry. I just wanted to get that off my chest. I can tell that 
you have changed. You are completely different for when we last met.&quot; 
He adds.

&quot;What is your angle, Mr. Slime?&quot;

&quot;I am the oldest worshipper of Ceiphed of my race. I don&#39;t want any 
harm to fall to Filia. You must tell her the truth.&quot;

&quot;Why? I don&#39;t ever plan to return to that life style again. Don&#39;t 
interfere!&quot;

&quot;You will have to tell her sooner or later. Do you think Kaana will 
simply let you go? And do you think she has forgotten your mission you 
abandoned?&quot; Squishie exclaims.

&quot;Maybe, but I will deal with that bridge when I get to it. Did you 
just come here to intimidate me? Because you are doing an excellent 
job.&quot;

&quot;My plans are my own agendas. Or as you would say &#39;That&#39;s a secret!&#39;&quot;

Later that night, Dana is taking care to the horse, Filia is making 
dinner, and Zelgadis is gathering firewood and game. Squishie is with 
Zelgadis assisting the only way he can.

&quot;Here is another one.&quot; Squishie replies.

&quot;If you are not going to help, then go back to the camp!&quot; Zelgadis 
demands with both of his hands filled with potential firewood.

&quot;I am helping. I have no arms to speak of. Besides it is boring out 
here with no one to talk to.&quot;

&quot;Says you. I like it when things are quiet.&quot;

&quot;Lead and adventurous life thus far, do we?&quot;

&quot;You could say that!&quot; Zelgadis exhales. &quot;So what is your story?&quot;

&quot;I am just your average slime who just happens to worship Ceiphed. 
What else it there to say?&quot;

&quot;I think there is more to you than you are letting on.&quot;

&quot;Would this face lie?&quot; Squishie says with a sinister grin on his face.

During that night, Dana is asleep. Once again she is lucid dreaming. 
Dana is in an opened field of grass surrounded by prairie as far as 
the eye can see. Before Dana can enjoy her surroundings, she is 
engulfed in the downcast of a colossal shadow. Dana is consumed by 
fear upon recognization of this shadow.

It is the shadow of the fire dragon king, Ceiphed, himself. Standing 
before Dana is the largest golden dragon she has ever seen in her 
life. Ceiphed is a hundred feet tall and at least a mile wide. He is 
covered from head to toe in golden shards, which are a part of his 
body. The scales are so bright and beautiful that Dana is momentary 
blinded by its glow. His voice shakes the ground as he speaks.

&quot;So young one, you believe you have changed your ways. How far are you 
willing to go to prove that?&quot;

&quot;I sacrificed my life as a male demon and I honor life for the rest of 
my days.&quot;

&quot;Not enough. You still have yet to prove that your vow is more than 
just words. Your actions will decide your fate.&quot;

&quot;What must I do?&quot;

&quot;In two days, you will return here. You must confront your past if you 
are to have a future. If you survive, I will allow you to become my 
disciple. Now, return to the world of the humans.&quot;

Dana awakes from her dream very abruptly. She is covered in a cold 
sweat. It is still the middle of the night.

&quot;Are you ok?&quot; Zelgadis replies surveying the campsite on his watch 
from a tree above.

&quot;I think so. I had a vision. It was from Ceiphed. I am to confront my 
past in two nights from now.&quot; Dana replies.

&quot;Ceiphed? Are you sure?&quot;

&quot;Yes. I should know him better than most.&quot;

&quot;Interesting. Why would he grant you a vision and not a disciple like 
Filia? And what does confronting your past mean?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know. I believe he wants to test my faith and prove to him 
that I have changed more than just physically.&quot; Dana states. &quot;By the 
way, where is the slime?&quot;

&quot;Good question. He said something about having to use the little 
slime&#39;s room, a few hours ago. In fact it was admittedly after you 
fell asleep.&quot;

&quot;I see. If you want Zel, I finish your watch. I will not be able to go 
back to sleep tonight, I am afraid.&quot;

&quot;It was that bad huh?&quot;

&quot;No. But I should rethink my plans.&quot;

The next morning, Filia is making breakfast for the camp, when Dana 
notices that Nagha is regaining conciseness. She stands up and real 
quick and runs over behind a tree in fear. Zelgadis, Dana, Squishie 
and Filia run to her aid.

&quot;I am sorry if we frightened you. We are here to help. We are 
friends.&quot; Zelgadis states offering his hand to Nagha in a gesture of 
friendship. She cowers and continues to tremble even more.

&quot;Let me try.&quot; Filia replies. &quot;Miss Nagha, we found you injured in the 
woods and we nursed you back to health. We offer our services for your 
benefit alone. We will not force you to do anything you don&#39;t want to 
do. I am preparing a nice breakfast, if you are hungry, you can have 
some.&quot;

Nagha&#39;s stomach grows and she nods her head.

&quot;Then follow me and I will fix some right up for you.&quot;

Nagha looks past Filia at something or someone. Dana notices what it 
is. The slime is standing behind Filia with a calm expression on his 
face. Nagha begins to calm down and slowly she walks forward towards 
the campsite. Filia takes a hold of her hand and leads her back to 
camp. The slime hops directly behind them.

After they all eat, the party continues out on the road once again. 
Zelgadis is scouting ahead, Dana is couching the wagon, and Filia is 
telling Nagha an old childhood story from her youth. Nagha is sitting 
down on the floor listening intently with the slime laying on her lap 
as a pet would. Squishie has an odd calming affect on the runaway 
princess. That thought can only fill Dana&#39;s mind with even more 
questions. But Dana does not let it get her overly concerned about it. 
What does worry her mind is what she is going to do to fulfill the 
fire dragon king&#39;s demand.

Later that day, Zelgadis informs the others of a small village on the 
road ahead. They decide that it is best if they stop at an inn for the 
night. Dana notices that the princess has not said a word all day. Did 
the attack on her life traumatize her so much that she is afraid to 
talk? Or is her voice box damaged in a way that it is beyond Filia&#39;s 
power to heal? &#39;I will have to ask Filia about this later.&#39;

Dana leads the wagon into the stable that is connected to a small 
two-story building which Zelgadis has informed her is the inn. Once 
inside, a young boy no older than ten takes the reins from Dana&#39;s 
hands. Filia and Nagha exit from the back of the wagon however the 
slime is nowhere to be seen.

&quot;Where&#39;s Squishie?&quot; Dana asks.

&quot;Oh.&quot; Filia replies. &quot;He said that he had something to do and that he 
would meet up with us, tomorrow. I think he is afraid of towns and 
large human communities.&quot;

&quot;I guess. Anyways, let&#39;s join up with Zelgadis inside.&quot;

That night, Filia joins back up with Dana in their room after helping 
Nagha settle down.

&quot;She is fast asleep. I feel sorry for her, you know. Being attacked by 
a demon like that.&quot; Filia replies.

&quot;How do you know she was attacked by a demon?&quot;

&quot;Squishie told me. He says that his kind can identify races by their 
smell alone. Dana, what happened to the demon that attacked Nagha?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s dead. I made sure of that myself.&quot;

&quot;Is there anything that you want to tell me? I know that I said you 
should bury your past but this is important.&quot;

&quot;Filia, look.&quot; Dana pauses briefly &quot;What I am about to tell you may be 
hard to believe but it is the truth. If you hate me afterwards and 
never want to see me again because of it, I will understand.&quot;

&quot;I could never hate you, my love. And I would forgive any crime that 
you have committed.&quot;

&quot;I am sorry, my sweet.&quot; Dana sighs. &quot;I am, or rather, was Xellos. My 
ex- master, Kaana the Beastmaster, ordered me to kill you and destroy 
the ancient dragon egg. She and the other demon lords felt that you 
and the egg would pose potential threat to them and their kind. I told 
her that I could not and would not obey such an order. I had fallen in 
love with you and everything you stood for, Filia. A demon having 
feelings towards another is unheard of. Kaana attacked me for telling 
her why. When I awake, I was cursed with the form you see before you 
now. She informed me that I was trapped in the body of a woman for the 
rest of my days and that I was cast out of their society forever. I 
was happy despite my curse. I wanted to live. I wanted to love. And I 
wanted to see you.

I had so many things that I wanted to tell you and then some but I 
doubt faith will permit me to do so by the look I am getting from your 
eyes. I know that you can not or I suspect will not ever forgive me. 
But I love you, Filia; and I hope that our love is more than just a 
few brief beautiful moments of indescribable passion. I have 
sacrificed all that I was to be all that I have become.

And I would do that and beyond to only see your gorgeous face for one 
more day. I would do anything for love.&quot;

Filia runs out of the room in tears. She almost knocks over Zelgadis 
on her way out. &quot;Filia, What&#39;s wrong?&quot; He says as she runs past him He 
looks back into the room at Dana &quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;I told her the truth.&quot; Dana says depressed. She too is also crying. 
&quot;I lost the woman that I love because I unveiled my past. I hate my 
life.&quot; Dana grabs a pillow and cries louder.

Filia runs out into the center of town and stops to sit down in front 
of a giant fountain.

&quot;Ceiphed, How could I be such a fool to be tricked by that demon, 
again?&quot; She yells with tears rushing down her face.

&quot;You thought you had found love is why you did what you did. Before 
that moment, you were completely in love with Dana.&quot; A voice says 
directly behind Filia. She turns around to see the slime standing 
behind her.

&quot;What do you know?&quot;

&quot;More than your tears are telling you. Dana did not tell you the truth 
to break your heart.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, right! Why else did she, he, it say that then?&quot;

&quot;Filia, calm down and think about the situation at hand. Dana was, is, 
and has always been a demon. Nothing can change that. Dana has not 
only sacrificed her life to be with you but she also gave up her own 
world and lifestyle to spend the rest of her days with you. She would 
face any danger to be with you. If that is not love than I don&#39;t know 
what is.&quot;

&quot;Who are you, really?&quot; Filia says as she starts to stop crying.

&quot;Look in your heart and search the deeps of your soul. You love her, 
too.&quot;

&quot;But she lied to me! And she is still Xellos!&quot;

&quot;No she did not. You told her that you didn&#39;t care about her past back 
on the day you shared your bodies with each other. She was Xellos once 
but she is Dana now.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; She says as she walks back to the inn.

Meanwhile, downstairs inside the inn, Zelgadis is drinking with Dana 
trying to calm her down. Several glasses of Ale are empty in front of 
them. Thus far it is not working.

&quot;Dana, you are overreacting. Filia doesn&#39;t hate you. She just has to 
figure things out on her own. She needs time. Once she gets her 
affairs in order, I&#39;m sure she will come back.&quot;

&quot;I doubt that.&quot; Dana sobs. &quot;Somehow, someway, the best ones get away.&quot; 
She starts to cry again.

Seconds later, Filia walks back in and over to the table Dana and 
Zelgadis are sitting at.

&quot;Zelgadis, I would like to talk to Dana in private.&quot; Filia replies. He 
gets up and walks back to his room.

&quot;You hate me, don&#39;t you?&quot; Dana mumbles.

&quot;I thought I did but no. I don&#39;t hate you.&quot;

&quot;But I lied to you.&quot; Dana says as she dries her eyes.

&quot;It does not matter now. You gave up more for me than I would have 
ever asked of you. Xellos is dead; Dana is alive. I hate Xellos not 
you.&quot;

&quot;Oh Filia, I love you with all my heart and soul.&quot; Dana replies as she 
hugs Filia.

&quot;I know, Dana, and I love you, too!&quot; They kiss. &quot;Now, let&#39;s go back up 
to our room and see how we can work this out.&quot;

The next day, Zelgadis is walking down the stairs to the dining hall 
as he sees Dana, Filia, and Nagha down here eating breakfast. Dana and 
Filia are both wearing rose dresses. Dana&#39;s dress is a red one and 
Filia&#39;s dress is a blue one. Dana&#39;s dress is the one she wore to Lina 
and Gourry&#39;s wedding. The expression on their faces is a pleasant one. 
&quot;I see everything worked out between you two last night.&quot; Zelgadis 
says to Dana.

&quot;Yes. We danced the night away, literally.&quot; She replies.

&quot;Aren&#39;t you two tired today?&quot; He responses.

&quot;Nope.&quot; Filia declares, &quot;I feel great. How about you, my love?&quot;

&quot;Terrific now that you are in my life, my sweet!&quot; Dana retorts.

&quot;Uh hem, By the way, how is Nagha&#39;s condition coming a long?&quot; He asks 
Filia in private.

&quot;Other than not talking, she appears to have made a full recovery. I 
believe that her vocal chords may have been severed in the assault. It 
is beyond my control.&quot; Filia lied.

&quot;I see. We can get started again when you ladies are ready.&quot; He 
replies.

Zelgadis walks over to Dana.

&quot;Don&#39;t you think that we should prepare for a demon attack at 
anytime?&quot; He whispers to her.

&quot;That is a concern of mine too. Maybe we have the gods&#39; blessing.&quot; 
Dana replies.

&quot;Ceiphed watches over all living beings as if they are his children.&quot; 
The slime replies.

&quot;And where did you come from?&quot; Zelgadis asks.

&quot;Good point.&quot; Dana adds. &quot;I thought that the fire dragon king was 
killed over 10,000 years ago.&quot;

&quot;He did, however, that does not mean his essence is gone. It simply 
took on another form. He could be anywhere and anyone by now.&quot;

&quot;Whatever&quot; Zelgadis replies. &quot;We had better be on our way soon.&quot;

Later that night, Dana and Filia manage to share the same dream. They 
both are in a cavern similar to the one where Jilas stole the sword of 
light, Gorunova, from Gourry.

&quot;It worked, my love!&quot; Filia says excitedly.

&quot;That would appear so, my sweet. I am glad you are with me. It will 
make the experience easier knowing that you believe in me.&quot; Dana 
replies.

A bright flash of light blinds both Dana and Filia. Standing on the 
ground before them is the slime, Squishie.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Filia speaks out. &quot;Where is the fire dragon king? I thought 
Ceiphed was suppose to be here.&quot;

&quot;He is standing before us, isn&#39;t he, Squishie?&quot; Dana retorts.

&quot;What gave me away?&quot; the slime who is really the fire dragon king, 
Ceiphed, himself in another form says.

&quot;You said and did several things that are not traditional of the slime 
race. Like taking for instance. Then, slimes to my knowledge have no 
vocal cords, making them unable to perform any type of speech pattern 
other thing a few squeaks. Plus, slimes are timid creatures who travel 
in small packs or tribes. Rarely would one see a solitary slime 
because of their instinctual need for companionship. And finally, 
slimes fear loud noises so unless you are extremely quiet and don&#39;t 
display any violet actions would one ever attempt contact with another 
life form.&quot;

&quot;Point taken.&quot; He pauses briefly. &quot;I should by all rights destroy you 
where you stand. Your past crimes would amount to more than a thousand 
years of extreme punishments that are even beyond my imagination and 
wisdom to enforce. The name of Xellos Beastmaster is a name that shall 
plaque existence for a lifetime to come. However, As Dana Lords, you 
have shown commitment and honor that is unheard of amongst the demon 
race. And with your recent efforts to protect the world during the 
Darkstar attacks have at least surprised the gods. We are unsure what 
is to become of you. Therefore we have decided to test you and your 
newly discovered beliefs.

First you are to dawn the cape of righteousness that you see before 
you now.&quot; A long red cape materializes before Dana&#39;s feet. She starts 
to put it on over her dress when Ceiphed speaks out again. &quot;You may 
only dawn the cape and nothing else.&quot;

Dana looks down at the slime. &quot;You mean you expect me to fight naked?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; He replies. &quot;You will be wearing the cape.&quot;

&quot;Baka no Hentai!&quot; (You&#39;re a Pervert!) She says as she takes off her 
cloths.

&quot;Oh yeah.&quot; The slime says. &quot;I mean, next you will confront a shadow of 
your former self. How you challenge him will determine your fate. 
Choose wisely.&quot;

Out of the shadows, a figure begins to take shape. After a few 
minutes, standing before Dana is an exact replica of her past self. 
Xellos Beastmaster is staring back at Dana. He matches her past self 
to a T.

&quot;You can do this, my love!&quot; Filia says as then they kiss.

&quot;Your love is all I need to win, my sweet darling, Filia.&quot; Dana 
replies as she kisses Filia one more time.

&quot;If this were any sweeter, I would get cavities.&quot; He says with intent 
to insult. &quot;Look at you, a timid little girl who has lost her will to 
kill. Do you really believe you have changed? Don&#39;t make me laugh! You 
don&#39;t love Filia because demons can&#39;t love anything. You will only use 
her until she loses your interest. How do expect to win?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t. I am going to let you win!&quot; Dana replies.

&quot;Huh?&quot; He says in surprise.

&quot;Dana! You can&#39;t! What about our love?&quot; Filia cries.

&quot;My words are not enough. If I truly love for you and the world, then 
I must be willing to die to protect the ones I love. Otherwise, my 
words are nothing but words. If I am wrong then we will meet in our 
next lives, my sweet!&quot; She retorts.

&quot;You are finished. Now Die!&quot; Xellos says as he hits Dana with his most 
powerful energy attack. Dana fights against the pain for as long as 
she can but eventually her body gives out and she falls unconscious 
from the pain. The last thing she sees is her beloved Filia runs over 
the caught her. Tears are running down Filia&#39;s beautiful face. A tear 
touches Dana and the world around her goes black.

Dana awakes from what feels like an eternal slumber. Her head is 
laying upon Filia&#39;s lap. Filia is holding Dana tighter than she has 
ever before.

&quot;You won, my love!&quot; Filia says as she sees that Dana is awake. She 
kisses Dana on the forehead.

&quot;I did?&quot; She says in disbelief.

&quot;Yes. You have done what both the gods and demons thought to be 
impossible. The love you share with Filia is truly extraordinary. 
Congratulations. You are now the first demon who will receive my 
blessing. Stand up my disciple.&quot;

Dana rises.

&quot;I, Ceiphed, the fire dragon king, now and forever more, expect you as 
my loyal follower. I will honor you decisions knowing that he have the 
heart of the world in them. I will permit you one wish. I can revoke 
your curse if that is your wish.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Dana says, as she looks deep in Filia&#39;s eyes. &quot;I want Xellos 
Beastmaster to remain dead. I love pleasing Filia as I am now. I feel 
like I have and was always meat to be the woman you see.&quot;

&quot;Very well. Then instead of granting you one wish I will give you this 
gift.&quot; A bright yellow glow surrounds Dana&#39;s naked body. &quot;The demon 
race will not be able to locate you from your powers anymore.&quot;

&quot;Bless you, Ceiphed. I will live my life to the fullest from this 
moment on.&quot; Dana replies.

&quot;Remember, love conquers all. You may return to the world of the 
humans now.&quot; He says as Dana and Filia start to wake up.

Dana awakes the next morning lying besides Filia who is holding Dana&#39;s 
red rose dress in her arms. Dana feels herself to discover that she is 
naked expect for the cape of righteousness. Zelgadis begins to walk in 
but then instantly leaves.

&quot;Dana,&quot; He says while blushing, &quot;Why are you naked?&quot;

&quot;I passed Ceiphed&#39;s test. I was ordered to only wear the cape of 
righteousness during my fight.&quot;

&quot;Well, can you get dressed now?&quot; He asks.

&quot;Right!&quot; Dana says as she changes into her pink flower dress.

Several days later, Dana, Filia, Nagha, and Zelgadis are enjoying a 
meal at one of Atlas City&#39;s many restaurants outside.

&quot;So Squishie was really Ceiphed in disguise?&quot; Zelgadis asks.

&quot;Correct. He is the living essence of what is left of the fire dragon 
king after his body was destroyed in the battle with Shabranigdu more 
than ten thousand years ago. He wanted to watch over the world in a 
new form that would not attract the wrong type of attention.&quot; Filia 
explains.

&quot;That would explain the calming affect he had on Nagha. One more 
question though, why can&#39;t Nagha talk yet? If he was Ceiphed, surely 
he should have cured her injuries.&quot; Zelgadis says while sipping his 
tea.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. But I am sure he would have his reasons.&quot; Dana adds.

&quot;That leaves the problem of communicating with her.&quot; Zelgadis 
proclaims.

&quot;I have the solution.&quot; Filia pulls out a pad of paper and a small 
ballpoint pen. &quot;It is a gift from Ceiphed. This magical pen and 
notepad will never run out no matter how many times anyone uses them.&quot; 
She hands both the pen and notepad to Nagha. Dana and Zelgadis notice 
that a picture of Squishie smiling is on both items.

Nagha writes &#39;Thank you&#39; on a note and hands it to them.

&quot;Now she can communicate with anyone she meets.&quot; Filia adds.

&quot;Now that is done, what are we could to do about the demon race? They 
still are hunting for the two of you and the ancient dragon egg.&quot; 
Zelgadis inquiries.

&quot;Ceiphed&#39;s blessing blocks out their radar on me. They will have to 
actually track us down on foot from this point forward.&quot; Dana answers.

&quot;But that does not solve our other problem thought.&quot; Zelgadis remarks.

&quot;No but that gives us a better chance than we had before.&quot; Dana 
replies.

&quot;And so will this!&quot; A male voice says coming from behind them. 
Everyone turns around to see Gourry and Lina standing in front of 
them. Gourry is once again holding a sword that appears to be 
Gorunova, the sword of light.

&quot;Lina? Gourry? Where did you two come from? And more importantly, how 
did you get back the sword of light?&quot; Zelgadis retorts.

&quot;It is a long story.&quot; Lina replies. &quot;So Dana, &#39;a little slime&#39; told me 
all about you and your situation.&quot; She pauses briefly. &quot;I must admit, 
you do make a pretty cute girl.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Miss Lina.&quot; Dana says.

&quot;So why did you not tell me about it at my wedding?&quot;

&quot;Well. you see. I huh. you had other things to worry about that day.&quot; 
She answers nervously not knowing what Lina might do to her.

&quot;You finally did it. I am so happy for the both of you.&quot; Filia says 
with joy. &quot;But why wasn&#39;t I invited?&quot; She quickly changes her tone.

&#39;That goes double for me.&#39; Nagha writes on her notepad.

&quot;Well you see.&quot; Lina replies. &quot;Anyways.&quot; Zelgadis interrupts. &quot;It is 
nice to be working with the both of you again. So, Lina, what is the 
plan?&quot;

&quot;Well, as far as I can figure, Kaana appears to be in control of the 
demon race since Hellmaster, Phibrizzo, died at the hands of yours 
truly. From everything I know about Kaana is that she is a gorgeous 
woman who likes the richer things in life. Money, wine, clothing, 
jewelry and the rest. She also has a bad habit of gambling. So this is 
what we do. We issue a challenge to her and the demon race for the 
fate of Dana, Filia and the ancient dragon egg. If we can defeat her 
champion then she will live them alone in peace.&quot;

&quot;And if we lose?&quot; Dana asks.

&quot;Let&#39;s not think about that.&quot; Lina replies.

&quot;And how do you suppose we do such a thing?&quot; Zelgadis asks.

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; She says.

Everyone face falls.

&quot;What do you mean you don&#39;t know? It is our lives you are talking 
about!&quot; He says in anger.

&quot;Settle down, Zel. I might know someway to find out.&quot;

&quot;And that is?&quot;

&quot;Since you are headed to Sayrun anyways we can just look for our 
answers there in their vast libraries.&quot; She says.

&quot;Alright. Then we should head out!&quot; Zelgadis says as he starts to 
leave.

&quot;But first, desert.&quot; Lina says.

Everyone again face falls except Gourry

&quot;Yeah!&quot; He replies.

Two days later, during the night, Lina and Dana are off in the woods 
by themselves.

&quot;Nagha informs me that you two were traveling companions back in the 
day. What was that like?&quot; Dana asks.

&quot;Trust me,&quot; She retorts. &quot;You don&#39;t want to know. I can still hear the 
horrible sound of her laughter in my nightmares. I am glad she cannot 
talk.&quot; Lina cringes.

&quot;I&#39;ll take your word for it!&quot; Dana replies.

&quot;So you really gave up everything you had for Filia. You most love her 
with all your heart and soul.&quot;

&quot;She means the world and beyond to me. My race is not meant to know 
what love is, but somehow our love transcends it all. When I was 
Xellos, her love was driving me crazy. I couldn&#39;t even perform my 
daily duties without her nature clouding my thoughts. Is that how you 
feel about Gourry?&quot;

&quot;I guess. There is just a feeling I get when I am around that big oaf. 
I can not image my life without him.&quot;

&quot;Does your sister, Luna, know yet?&quot;

&quot;Heavens no! I wouldn&#39;t hear the end of it once she does.&quot;

&quot;Well, thank you again for deciding to help.&quot;

&quot;Think nothing of it. That&#39;s what friends are for.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a whole new world we live in, isn&#39;t it, Miss Lina?&quot;

&quot;Sometimes.&quot;

&quot;Let us live our lives from day to day, then?&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.&quot; She replies.

Several days later, the group approaches the outskirts of Sayrun. 
Nagha stands at the outskirts and stares as if she is frozen in place.

&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Filia asks.

She doesn&#39;t reply for a moment then she writes something down on her 
notepad.

&#39;I never realized that home was so beautiful before. I only though of 
leaving back then. I never took in the world around me. If I could 
talk right now, I would be speechless.&#39;

&quot;It feels good to belong somewhere, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; Gourry replies.

&quot;Where did that come from?&quot; Lina retorts.

&quot;It is just my opinion.&quot; He explains.

&quot;I would have to agree with Mr. Gourry.&quot; Filia speaks out. &quot;I was lost 
when I discovered the truth about the atrocious things my people had 
done to the ancient dragons. I hated what I was until I learned that 
one&#39;s past does not make us who we are. I am a good person because of 
my love of life and I can forgive people for their sins. Everyone 
desires a second chance.&quot; She says as she looks at Dana.

&quot;She&#39;s right.&quot; Dana replies. &quot;I probably was the worst of them all. I 
killed so many that I lost count. Their blood is on my hands for the 
rest of my days. Nothing I do can bring them back. I can only live 
each moment of my life at a time. I pray that someday they can forgive 
me. I will try to be the best woman I can be. I will help others in 
need. I have to redeem myself in their eyes in no other.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know if that will ever happen but I am proud to say that I am 
your friend, Dana!&quot; Zelgadis honestly states.

&quot;Life is not filled with easy choices. We are who and what we have 
become for a reason. We change, as fate deems necessary. Good and Evil 
are what we make it; they do not exist without us. Does anyone else 
feel the need to express his or her point of view?&quot; Lina comments. 
&quot;No, then good. I have one last thing to say.&quot; She pauses to capture 
everyone&#39;s attention. &quot;Let&#39;s eat!&quot;

Again everyone face falls except Gourry who yells. &quot;Yeah!&quot;

Two hours later, Lina and Gourry are just about finished with their 
meal. Dana, Filia, Nagha, and Zelgadis are sipping on cups of tea 
while patiently waiting.

&quot;So, how are we going to do this?&quot; Zelgadis speaks up.

&quot;What (munching on a chicken leg) do you (she shallows) mean?&quot; Lina 
talks while eating.

&quot;You know I hate it when you do that!&quot; Zelgadis grumbles.

Lina stops and says. &quot;Don&#39;t worry so much, Zel. We will go to the main 
libraries after we finish here. Nagha&#39;s royal badge will get us in. 
Just like it is covering our meal.&quot;

Nagha frantically writes on her notepad. &#39;You mean the royal badge I 
had to sell to pay for our first meal back in that village years ago?&#39;

&quot;Zel, we&#39;ll be seeing you.&quot; Lina says as she grabs the last of the 
food and runs out. Gourry looks up. &quot;Hey, I was not done with that!&quot; 
He replies as he runs after her. &quot;Oh no, you don&#39;t Lina!&quot; Zelgadis 
says as he runs after them.

A warm breath is breathing down Dana&#39;s neck. She turns around to see a 
plump older man in a chief&#39;s outfit who is holding a butcher knife is 
standing there.

&quot;I&#39;m sure we can work something out.&quot; Dana says in a panic.

The man says nothing as he tosses Dana and Nagha each a moist tower 
and he hands Filia a waitress&#39;s uniform. &quot;Work is the right word. Now 
move it.&quot; He barks an order.

Seven hours later, Dana, Nagha, and Filia arrive at the palace gates 
where the others are standing with Prince Philanel. He almost knocks 
Lina over as he runs to hug his daughter.

&quot;Daughter!&quot; He cries.

&#39;Daddy!&#39; She writes.

&quot;Oh, it is so good to see you again. I can only imagine the tales you 
have to tell.&quot; Philanel replies.

Nagha gives her father a stern look.

&quot;I mean, you will once you get your voice back. Miss Lina filled me in 
on the details. Come you must be tired. We will talk about it over 
dinner.&quot;

&quot;Miss Lina, if you met with Prince Phil hours ago, why where we stuck 
paying the bill?&quot; Filia asks with an angry tone.

&quot;Well, you see.&quot;

&quot;Ladies.&quot; Prince Phil says as he gets between Lina and Filia. &quot;What&#39;s 
done is done! If you want, I can have the servants draw up a nice hot 
bath for you so you can relax before dinner.&quot;

&quot;A bath would be divine. Thank you, Prince Phil.&quot; Filia states as she 
completely forgets about being mad at Lina.

&quot;Follow me.&quot; He says.

Dana and Filia are lead to a large room. Inside the room is a changing 
area with hundreds of tiny shelves to place various articles of 
clothing. Dana and Filia start to undress.

&quot;Nagha is right. Sayrun is beautiful!&quot; Filia states.

&quot;I have secretly loved this kingdom for years.&quot; Dana proclaims.

&quot;Prince Phil is a great guy despite his looks. I hope Nagha will be 
happy now that she is home.&quot;

&quot;I believe she will be. She can heal here better than anywhere else. 
Maybe someday she can heal her voice box too.&quot;

&quot;Dana, there is nothing wrong with Nagha&#39;s voice box. I lied. She 
remains silent completely by choice.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s crazy! Why would she not want to talk?&quot;

&quot;Maybe she feels she needs to listen more right now than talk. We all 
could learn that lesson more often. If she ever talks again, it will 
be when she wants to and not before.&quot;

&quot;I guess you&#39;re right, my sweet!&quot;

&quot;There is something else bothering you, my love. I can see it in your 
eyes.&quot;

&quot;I am wondering why Amelia is not here to greet us. I thought she 
would be thrilled to see her older sister again.&quot;

&quot;I doubt it&#39;s that. I bet she is just busy with affairs of state. She 
is the crowned princess you know?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right. Now what can we do to kill sometime before dinner?&quot; 
Dana teases.

Filia presses her naked body against Dana&#39;s naked back. &quot;I have a few 
ideas.&quot;

Once the bath is over one hour later, Dana and Filia notice that their 
clothing is gone and replace with two dresses. One is purple and the 
other is yellowish gold. Each dress matches each of their hair colors. 
They each dress quickly and walk outside. Prince Philanel is waiting 
for them there.

&quot;Now if you would follow me, we can begin dinner.&quot; He says and then 
stops all of a sudden. &quot;I must say, you do make a lovely couple.&quot;

Both women blush

&quot;Who told you?&quot; Dana asks.

Prince Phil laughs. &quot;You did by the way you both look at each other. 
There is a passion in your eyes that lovers share. Despite what you 
might of heard, Sayrun does not frown upon alternative lifestyles. 
Love is all that matters. If you two ever plan on getting married, I 
would be honored to host it.&quot;

Dana and Filia stare deep into each other&#39;s eyes.

&quot;We will let you know when that happens.&quot; Dana replies. &quot;We only lack 
the funds at the moment.&quot;

&quot;Guard!&quot; Prince Phil barks. Within seconds, a young male guard comes 
running up. The prince whispers something to him and he leaves quickly 
only to return about as fast. He is caring a box that he opens and 
gives to Dana. Inside the box are about fifty golden ornate rings.

&quot;What is this for?&quot; Dana asks.

&quot;Pick out the one you want to give her.&quot; Prince Philanel replies.

&quot;Huh? Why?&quot; Dana says in surprise.

&quot;You saved my daughter&#39;s life. It is the least I can do.&quot;

After about two minutes of deep thought, Dana makes her choice. She 
kneels before Filia and holds out a small blue diamond ring with a 
white gold band. &quot;Filia, I know this is not what you expected, in 
fact, I am surprised by it too. But I am trying to ask you, will you 
marry me?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Dana, I will!&quot; Filia says as hugs Dana in romantic joy. Dana 
places the ring on Filia&#39;s finger. They passionately kiss.

&quot;Excellent. Now let&#39;s tell the others know the good news.&quot; He says as 
he wipes a tear from his eyes.

Ten minutes later, they arrive at the dinning hall. Inside Lina, 
Gourry, and Zelgadis are already seated along with several other men 
and women dressed in formal tuxedos and gowns. Dana notices that 
neither Amelia nor Nagha is present. A servant leads them to their 
seats as Prince Philanel directs the attention of the room.

&quot;Before we eat, I have two announcements. First of all, I would like 
to thanks Miss Lina and her friends. Without their help, my lovely 
daughter, Nagha would not have the pleasure of joining us tonight.&quot;

The room is filled with the sound of applause as everyone in the room 
starts clapping upon Nagha&#39;s arrival. She is wearing a long dark black 
dress as she takes her place next to her father.

&quot;My daughter has lost the use of her voice. So if asked would you give 
her the respect and patience when fulfilling a request of hers. Now 
for the second announcement I would like to direct your attention to 
Ms. Dana Lords.&quot;

Dana stands up. &quot;Thank you, Prince Philanel. As of today, I have 
offered my hand in marriage to my sweet darling, Filia. She has 
excepted.&quot;

There is a mixture of applause and odd silence amongst the crowd.

&quot;Listen up everyone!&quot; Prince Philanel states. &quot;Dana and Filia are in 
love with each other as much as any other man and woman who are in 
love. Their passions and feelings for each other are strong as any 
other relationship, if not more. Their love should be celebrated as we 
would any other. I am embeared by whichever of you who would think 
otherwise.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot; Amelia shouts out posing from a window seal 20 feet 
above the room. &quot;Love is what makes our lives worth wild. It makes you 
feel like you can fly without wings. Love is the fire that warms our 
hearts and comforts our soul. Only an enemy of justice would challenge 
true love!&quot; Amelia replies then she successfully jumps down to the 
floor.

The crowd begins to talk amongst itself. First, one pair of hands 
starts clapping. And then another followed by another. Soon the entire 
room is applauding.

&quot;You can serve dinner now.&quot; Prince Philanel orders the servants who 
are patiently waiting to begin. As the food is being served, musicians 
start to play a slow soft melody. Amelia takes her seat next to her 
father.

&quot;So you decided to take the plunge?&quot; Zelgadis teases Dana.

She blushes. &quot;Believe it or not, but Prince Philanel originally 
brought forth the idea. Looking back, I am glad he did.&quot; She implies 
giving Filia a look of pride. &quot;I couldn&#39;t picture my life without 
her.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; Lina shouts between chewing.

Everyone stops what he/she was saying or doing and remains silent. The 
musicians stop also. Lina has the attention of the entire room.

&quot;I.um.never mind.&quot; She retorts. All conversations continue as if 
nothing ever happened. The music starts back up too.

Zelgadis whispers to Lina. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll tell you, later.&quot; She whispers back to him.

The meal ends peacefully as many of the people part and go their 
separate ways. The only people remaining are Lina, Gourry, Zelgadis, 
Dana, Amelia, Filia, Nagha, and Prince Philanel.

&quot;If you would follow me.&quot; Prince Philanel says to the others. He leads 
them to what appears to be a large library/living room. Everyone takes 
a seat except Lina and the prince himself.

&quot;The floor is yours, Miss Lina.&quot; The prince gestures to Lina.

&quot;First before I can explain my ideas, I must ask Dana to step forward 
. &quot; Dana does as asked. &quot;Tell your story to everyone. In order for my 
plan to work, the others will need to be filled in on all of the 
details.&quot;

Dana clears her throat. She explains her story to everyone in the 
room. After she is done, there are several confused and misunderstood 
expressions coming from Amelia, Nagha, Gourry, and even Prince 
Philanel. Amelia is the first to break the silence.

&quot;I knew it! I knew that Mr. Xellos, I mean Ms. Dana, was redeemable. 
Your story has rekindled my faith in the power of love. You and Ms. 
Filia make a charming couple.&quot;

During Amelia&#39;s speech, Gourry walks over to the window.

&quot;You really go all out here, Prince Phil.&quot; He says

&quot;Why, thank you!&quot; Philanel replies.

&quot;I never expected a fireworks display on our behalf.&quot; Gourry mentions.

&quot;Well, we do our best.&quot; He prideful says. &quot;What fireworks?&quot;

&quot;Those fireworks.&quot; Gourry says as he points at the window. Everyone 
runs over to the window to see a big explosion going of in the middle 
of the sky outside. &quot;See, there goes another one.&quot;

&quot;That was no firework. That was a rocket exploding.&quot; Zelgadis states 
as he runs out of the room. The others follow him.

Once they arrive at the site of the explosion, they see nothing but 
destroyed pieces of a rocket scattered across the horizon. Observing 
the scene, Zelgadis replies. &quot;Look at this.&quot; He motions to Filia. 
&quot;Doesn&#39;t it remind you of something Jilas would use?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; She replies. &quot;It does.&quot;

&quot;Heelp!&quot; A voice yells.

&quot;Get us down!&quot; A different voice cries.

Zelgadis is the first to spot them. He finds Jilas and Grievous stuck 
in a tree. Jilas has one hand holding an egg while the other is caught 
on a branch.

&quot;Found them.&quot; Zelgadis yells back to the group.

Moments later, Gourry and Dana help them down. Filia runs up to Jilas 
and Grievous. &quot;What were you doing?&quot; She asks.

&quot;It was &#39;orrible, Boss.&quot; Jilas proclaims. &quot;Stronola was attacked by a 
horde of demons. The whole town was burning when we left.&quot;

&quot;We managed to escort as many to safety as we could. Samuel and the 
others were leading the refuges to Atlas City as we made our way here 
to inform you all of what resided.&quot; Grievous explains.

&quot;Let&#39;s continue this inside.&quot; Prince Philanel replies.

Ten minutes later, Jilas and Grievous are sipping their tea and being 
warmed up with towels covering them.

&quot;What happened, Jilas? Don&#39;t leave any detail out.&quot; Filia says as she 
mothers the egg.

&quot;Well.&quot; He says after sipping on his tea. &quot;After you all left, 
everything was quiet and peaceful. Then one day, this odd man, dressed 
in a black cape and gray cloak that hides his features, showed up in 
town. According to the word on the street, he was asking about you, 
Dana, and the egg. The man offered to pay 50 gold coins for any 
information. Since he found no answers, he left. Two days later, the 
sky turned black with the overcast of a large shadow created by 
hundreds upon hundreds of winged demons. They massacred everyone in 
sight. The town militia did what they could but they too were 
slaughtered in mere minutes.&quot; He starts to cry as he recalls the scene 
in this mind.

Grievous continues where Jilas can not. &quot;We managed to help the 
survivors by gather them all in one place. With Samuel&#39;s aid, we dug a 
tunnel leading out near his home. From there we organized the people 
and figured out the safest route towards Atlas City for them. Then we 
started to head for Sayrun. This one.&quot; He says pointing at Jilas. 
&quot;wanted to test out a new invention of his. The jetpack. Everything 
went fine until we almost arrived here. The rest you know.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s enough!&quot; Dana shouts. Everyone&#39;s attention is on her.

&quot;What&#39;s a matter?&quot; Zelgadis asks.

&quot;You have given up more than I would have ever asked you to. Even when 
I was Xellos, I would have never expected so much of you. This fight 
is my fight, not yours. I must finish it alone.&quot; Dana says then 
teleports away.

&quot;Dana, wait!&quot; Lina yells but is too late.

&quot;Great!&quot; Zelgadis adds. &quot;What do we do now?&quot;

&quot;What else?&quot; She replies. &quot;We go after her.&quot;

&quot;I can not allow that!&quot; A male voice says coming for the floor.

&quot;Who said that?&quot; Gourry asks.

&quot;I did.&quot; Everyone notices a little blue slime standing on the floor in 
front of them.

&quot;A slime that talks?&quot; Amelia says in disbelief.

&quot;That&#39;s no slime.&quot; Lina remarks. &quot;Standing before us is the one and 
only fire dragon king.&quot;

Jilas, Amelia, Grievous, Gourry (who forgets everything unless it 
involves fighting.) and Prince Phil stare in shock and dismay.

&quot;You&#39;re Ceiphed?&quot; Jilas comments.

&quot;Yes. But please call me Squishie. Ceiphed is too formal.&quot;

&quot;So, tell me Squishie, why are you trying to stop us?&quot; Zelgadis 
inquiries.

&quot;Because you will all be dead if you get involved.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Lina retorts. &quot;Where have you been for the last decade? I am 
the great, Lina Inverse. Slayer of Demons, Protector of Galaxies, 
Beautiful Heroine of the defenseless.&quot;

He interrupts her. &quot;.I know. But it matters not. What they lack in 
power, the demon race makes up in shear numbers. Eventually everyone 
would fall before them.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t believe what I am hearing. The fire dragon king giving up on 
the world. I thought you were suppose to protect us.&quot; Amelia cries 
out. &quot;I don&#39;t know about the rest of you but I am willing to lead Dana 
my help. She is our friend and more than that she is fighting to save 
everything she holds dear. I am not going to let her make that 
sacrifice in vain. Who is with me?&quot;

&quot;I am!&quot; Jilas cries.

&quot;You can count on me.&quot; Grievous says.

&quot;You already know my answer.&quot; Zelgadis calmly replies.

&quot;I am more than happy to.&quot; Gourry states.

&quot;Youth today with it&#39;s heart so pure and courageous. You would need an 
army to stop me.&quot; Prince Philanel retorts.

Nagha gestures yes.

&quot;I love Dana and I am not about to let her throw her life away no 
matter how inclined she is to do otherwise.&quot; Filia says.

&quot;Do you need to ask?&quot; Lina replies. &quot;Let&#39;s do this one for Dana!&quot;

&quot;Yeah!&quot; Everyone shouts in unison.

&quot;I admire your determination but I am sorry. Time freeze.&quot; The slime 
says as everyone is stopped in place. &quot;I hope you can forgive me 
someday. This is something Dana has to do alone.&quot;

Meanwhile, Dana teleports to the devastated remains of the town of 
Stronola. Dana hardly manages to keep from vomiting at the awful 
sight. The streets are covered in blood, body parts, bodies, and fiery 
debris. All of the buildings are in shambles and not one of them has 
even four walls left. Despite her feelings of disgust, Dana process 
towards where she believes Kaana is.

As she walks forward, Dana steps on the remains of a little girl&#39;s 
doll. She picks it up and stares at it for a moment. The rage inside 
of her breaks out at that instance. Dana yells at the top of her 
lungs. Hundreds of demons run out of the buildings to see where the 
noise is coming from. They run towards Dana in attack mode. She 
obliterates all of them with the vigorous energy power-up alone. Dana 
takes up flight towards the ruins of Filia&#39;s antique shop.

Standing just inside the shop is Kaana, who is surveying over the 
damage.

&quot;So you have decided to finally come out of hiding. I thought I was 
going to have to eliminate half of this planet&#39;s population before you 
would show up. I must admire you do make a beautiful woman. I should 
have done this years ago.&quot;

&quot;This ends now!&quot; Dana replies.

&quot;My thoughts exactly! You have been a thorn in my side for many years. 
We have so many more pressing matters to tend to these days. Like 
resurrecting our dark lord, Shabranigdu, for instance.&quot;

&quot;You did not hear me correctly, Kaana. I meant to say the demon race 
shall never again dig its claws into humanity&#39;s back for one minute 
more. I plan on defeating you and relinquishing your command of our 
race. I challenge you to one final battle. Winner takes it all. What 
do you say?&quot;

&quot;You have spent too much time around humans. It has driven you mad, 
Xellos.&quot;

&quot;.the man is Dana Lords, you fiendish ugly old hag.&quot; She retorts.

Kaana power up in rage. Everything surrounding the two of them is 
destroyed leaving a large empty field.

&quot;You fool! If that is what you want then, that is what you shall get. 
Winner of this battle will take control of the demon race. Prepare to 
die, bitch!&quot; She shouts as she fires a thousand fireballs at Dana.

Dana teleports behind Kaana and she punches in her back knocking Kaana 
a mile down into the earth. As she stands up, Dana grabs Kaana by her 
hair and tosses her into the sky. Kaana barely manages to dodge a 20 
foot wide energy blast aimed directly at her, a second later.

&quot;When did you get this powerful?&quot; Kaana cries out in amazement.

&quot;I always was.&quot; Dana yells back. &quot;I just never had a reason to do so 
before now.&quot;

&quot;But that would make you almost as powerful as Shabranigdu, himself?&quot;

Dana punches her fist through Kaana&#39;s stomach leaving a large hole in 
its place. &quot;Yes. It would.&quot;

Kaana&#39;s power betrays her by fading away at this moment. Her lifeless 
body falls to the ground below.

50 years later, a young girl named Yonval is playing in the field 
outside her house. She is picking daises on a bright sunny day.

&quot;Yonval.&quot; Her mother calls out. &quot;Lunch is ready!&quot;

She gathers up her flowers, puts them into her basket, and runs 
inside.

&quot;Make sure to wash your hands.&quot;

&quot;I will, Auntie Dana.&quot; Yonval says.

After lunch, Filia is washing the dishes while Dana and Yonval are 
finishing their tea at the table.

&quot;Auntie Dana?&quot; Yonval asks.

&quot;Yes, dear!&quot;

&quot;Tell me another story about Lina Inverse again!&quot;
