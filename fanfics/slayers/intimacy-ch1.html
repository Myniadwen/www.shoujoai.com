<H4>  Webmaster's Notes  </H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">  blue  </FONT>  =  L-sama's speech

<P>  Originally, this was gold, but gold doesn't show up well on white, so I changed it to 
blue.

<HR>

<P><I>  I am Lina Inverse.  </I>

<HR>

<P>  Lina frowned.  Where the hell was she now?  One
minute she was fighting Phibrizo, the next she
was here.  Where ever  <I>  that  </I>  was.

<P><I>  Not much to look at</I>, Lina noted, crossing her
arms.  A basically featureless room, all made 
of some weird, dull black substance Lina didn't
recognize.  There wasn't even a chair in which 
to sit.

<P><I>  Uhh...  </I>  Make that there  <I>  hadn't been  </I>  a chair.
The moment Lina had thought about it, a plushy
chair appeared.  <I>  Black velvet and gold trim?
Weird.  </I>

<P>  After examining the seat for traps and finding
none, Lina sat down and again ponder the question
of her location.

<P><I>  With the way this chair appeared, I'd almost 
think this was the astral plane or something,
but it just doesn't  <B>  feel  </B> like the astral plane.  </I>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">  Very good.  This isn't the astral plane.  </FONT>

<P>  "What the - ?!" Lina spat, jumping out of her seat
and turning to the sound of the "voice."  Except
it wasn't anything like a mundane voice, in the
same way a toad's croak was nothing like a diva's
aria.

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">  It's your own mind.  Sorry about the little delay,
but I had to discipline an unruly child.  </FONT>

<P>  Lina stared at the speaker.  A beautiful woman
stood before her, casually leaning against a 
doorjamb that hadn't been there seconds before.
Lustrous blonde hair, the colour of molten
gold, fell past the woman's waist.  Her eyes
were obscured by bangs, and her lips were turned
up in an amused and strangely fond smile.  The
most striking thing was the aura the woman exuded.
It gave Lina the weirdest urge to abase herself
before the blond woman.  But strangest of all, the
woman seemed tantalizingly familiar...

<P>  Lina bit the inside of her cheek.  To her relief,
there was real pain, and that pain helped clear
the confused sorceress' head.  "Who are you?"

<P>  The woman's smile widened.  <FONT COLOR="blue">  You know.  You just
won't let yourself realise it.  </FONT>

<P><I>  Great.  Just what I need, someone else who talks
riddles.  As if Xelloss weren't bad enough.  </I>

<P>  The woman approached the little sorceress, and with 
every step the feeling that Lina knew this woman
increased.

<P><I>  No way...  </I>  Lina shook her head at the thought that
suddenly occurred to her.  "L-sama..." she swore under 
her breath.

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">  You remember.  I'm so pleased.  </FONT>

<P>  Lina stared.  While her rational mind was screaming
denials, Lina's heart was becoming more and more
certain that the being before her was indeed the
Lord of Nightmares.

<P>  "L-sama...?"  It was a question this time.

<P>  L-sama smiled sweetly.  <FONT COLOR="blue">  Yes, Lina-chan?  </FONT>

<P>  "Uh...why are you here?  If this is my mind..."

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">  It is</FONT>, L-sama assured as she put a hand on Lina's
shoulder.  Underneath her tunic, Lina's skin tingled
at the contact; it was almost a burning sensation,
but wasn't unpleasant in the least.  Quite the opposite,
actually...

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">  I'm here to see you, of course.  To be with my especial
favourite.  </FONT>

<P>  Lina couldn't help but redden at the praise.  Sure,
she'd known L-sama must kinda like her, or else Lina
would never haven been able to cast Her magicks.  
<I><B>  Especial  </B>  favourite?  </I>  a small voice in Lina's mind
squeaked.  <I>  Really?  </I>

<P>  L-sama's smile was gentle now, and Lina thought she could
make out flashes of gold beneath Her bangs.  The closer
she looked, the brighter the sparks seemed to grow.  Lina
felt light-headed.

<P>  "Wh-why now?" Lina stuttered.

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">  I knew I'd have to punish Phibrizo sooner or later.  This
way, I punished him, and now can be with you.  </FONT>  L-sama's
smile was the epitome of enigmatic.  <FONT COLOR="blue">  Doesn't that sound 
nice?  </FONT>

<P>  Lina nodded without thinking, again becoming entranced
by the golden fire beneath L-sama's bangs.  Suddenly
coming back to herself, Lina's nerves decided to 
inform her that this was probably not a good situation.

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">  Shh</FONT>, L-sama soothed, both Her hands now burning
into Lina's shoulders.  

<P>  It was about this time that Lina realised L-sama had 
lost Her shimmering shift and was nude.  <I>  It's...
She's...perfect...  </I>  Lina couldn't help but note.  
<I>  Well, of course She's perfect; She  <B>  is  </B>  L-sama, 
after all...  </I>  the startled girl rationalized her
train of thought.

<P>  Then Lina was nude, too.  She would have freaked
out were she not already freaking out over something
else she noticed: she could not only feel L-sama's
hands on her shoulders, she could feel her  <I>  own  </I>  
shoulders, as if L-sama's hands were her own.

<P>  L-sama gently pulled Lina closer, and the little
sorceress felt both the sensation of being pulled
and that of pulling.

<P><I><FONT COLOR="blue">  Do not be afraid.  </FONT></I>  For a moment Lina thought
it was her own thought, but then recognised L-sama's
'voice.'

<P><I><FONT COLOR="blue">  Be with me</FONT></I>, L-sama urged, and suddenly that thought  
<I>  was  </I>  Lina's.  She was no longer Lina Inverse, nor
was the Lord of Nightmares the being She once was; the
two had merged, their astral forms creating one 
amalgamated being.

<P>  Incomprehensible secrets became clear to the portion
of the melded being that was once Lina Inverse.
Most importantly, every thought, every emotion L-sama
had experienced in regard to her especial favourite
was laid bare.

<P>  In moments or eons, they separated back into two beings, 
leaving Lina feeling empty, bereft, half-alive.

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">  I'm sorry, Lina-chan.  There's a nuisance I must deal
with, but I will return shortly.  </FONT>

<P>  Lina just nodded, too overwhelmed to verbalize anything
yet.  She watched the projection of the Lord of Nightmares
shimmer and dissolve. 

<P><I>  I  <B>  ceased to exist  </B>  for a while there.  Shouldn't that
scare the hell out of me?  </I>  Lina wondered, basking in the
afterglow of the joining.  <I>  Still, it was just so...
beautiful...that I almost wish we could've stayed like 
that...  </I>
   
<P>  L-sama reappeared before Lina, again clad in her shift.  
<FONT COLOR="blue">  I'm afraid we must cut this tryst short, my Lina.
I was just reminded - rather rudely, actually - that you
still have things to do, people to kill, prophecies
to fulfill, that sort of thing.  </FONT>

<P>  Lina couldn't help but groan.  <I>  I  <B>  hate  </B>  prophecy.  </I>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">  Don't worry, my Lina.  We will be together, and 
soon.  </FONT>

<P>  Having just learned from their joining what her
lifespan was likely to be, Lina had no idea if soon
mean weeks or years or centuries.

<P>  L-sama caressed Lina's cheek, Her touch leaving a
pleasant warm tingle.  <FONT COLOR="blue">  Keep our secret well,
my precious one</FONT>,  L-sama commanded, before kissing
Lina softly on the lips.  This spread the warm
feeling throughout Lina's form.

<P>  Everything faded out around Lina, though L-sama's
parting words rang clearly in her mind:  <FONT COLOR="blue">  Soon,
my Lina-chan.  Soon.  </FONT>

<HR>

<P>  Returning to consciousness was expectedly insane.  
<I>  How dare Gourry hold me like that?!  Only SHE
can hold me that way!  </I>  a small voice in Lina's 
head screamed, a voice strangely similar to 
L-sama's.  

<P>  Lina had not been particularly scared during her 
'stay' with L-sama, even when she'd stopped being
her for a little while.  However, now a thought 
occurred to her that shook her to the core:

<P><I>  I am Lina Inverse...aren't I?  </I>
