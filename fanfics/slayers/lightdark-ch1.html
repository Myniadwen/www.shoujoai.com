<h1>The Light Inside the Darkness</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dragonhealer.html">Dragonhealer</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I look down at the girl in my arms as we are on the bed. How did this 
happen? How could it have happened? I am a sorceress of black magic. I 
am known as the bandit-killer, the dragon-destroyer, I am feared by 
all wherever I go, I destroy bandit camps and take their treasures, I 
admit, I can be selfish, I can be cold-hearted, it was like I never 
cared about anyone else but myself, until I met her.

I stroke her soft hair, holding her close to my own naked body. I can 
hear her soft breathing as she relaxes in my warm embrace. I look 
outside the window of our inn room. There is a glowing moon. Was it 
fate? Was it destiny? She is a princess of white magic. She is 
innocent, pure on the inside, had a proper upbringing, cares more 
about others than herself, always tries to do the right thing, even if 
it cost her own life, the opposite of myself. I thought hard as I move 
my hands down to rub against her back. She moans softly at the gentle 
touch as I rest my chin on top of her soft black hair. 

Ever since the day we met, we stuck together like glue. I never 
imagined I would be able to tolerate someone who turned against me at 
one point. Three long years of being together, through and through, no 
matter what we were always there for each other. What was it about her 
that I liked? Was it the fact she is a princess? Was it her specialty 
in white magic? No, I even called her an annoying little princess. But 
she admired me no matter what; despite my reputation, despite my dark 
desires, she changed all that. After so many adventures, I&#39;ve finally 
come to a conclusion. She means more to me than all the treasure I&#39;ve 
ever gotten combined. And I can tell the same thing applies to her as 
well. To think I was jealous of her life as a royal. Poor girl&#39;s had a 
long lonely life. All those endless hours of studying in her room, 
having to live up to her father&#39;s expectations but could never do what 
she wanted to do. What was that? What I had. A life full of freedom. A 
life full of adventure and exploring the world. How ironic that those 
were the things she had always been deeply envious of me. I could only 
think of the wealth she was born into, but never how she truly felt 
deep inside. Yes, I have grown to love the princess who was always 
there to help me out. She has grown up so much. 

I tilt her chin gently and gaze into her beautiful sparkling eyes. She 
smiles, blushing. I can tell by the moonlight. It makes her face even 
more beautiful. Passionate love shining in her eyes, almost shedding 
light, piercing my soul, her warm smile, her entire face is enough to 
melt even my own rather cold heart. My mind is immediately at peace as 
I look into them. &lt;Such beautiful and innocent eyes, like two of the 
most beautiful stars taken from the night sky&gt; I think to myself. 
Stroking her cheek, I admire her body, no longer jealous of it. 

I place my left hand on her right cheek. Her smile grows more 
beautiful, her eyes close, and she leans against my hand. I caress her 
cheek gently, my heart melting by the sight of her happy face, her 
life having been completed since she met me. I&#39;ve stolen treasures 
beyond anyone&#39;s imaginations, but I&#39;ve stolen something whose value 
could never be surpassed , the heart of a princess who loves me for 
who I am, not for what I had, what I can do or what I am.  I suddenly 
feel tears forming in my eyes.  She glances up slowly, notices and 
reaches up.  I close my eyes, feeling her soft and gentle hand brushing 
away my tears.  I kiss it softly and look down at her.  She smiles. 
&lt;How could I possibly deserve...such passionate love from her?&gt;

She rests her body against mine, sighing. I can tell it a sigh of 
content and happiness more than anything, from the moment she made her 
confession to me here inside our room. I wrap my arms around her, 
holding her close and smiling. I love the warmth of our bodies pressed 
against each other. I love her. I really do. I can no longer hide my 
feelings anymore. &quot;Amelia?&quot; I whisper as gently as possible. Just 
saying her name makes me feel warm inside. &quot;Hai, Lina-san?&quot; Even the 
sound of her voice can sweep my mind away like a dream. Gently I pull 
her down to lay next to me. I stare into her eyes. I can actually hear 
her heart pounding, her eyes staring back into mine. &quot;I love you.&quot; I 
wrap an arm around her and pull her closer. Her eyes seem to sparkle 
like diamonds under the moonlight. &quot;Lina Inverse?&quot; She reaches out and 
caress my cheek. &quot;I&#39;ve been meaning to say the same thing. I love you, 
too, with my life. No money or treasure anywhere can ever match to how 
much you&#39;re worth to me. You&#39;re like an angel from heaven, an answer to 
all my wishes and prayers since I was a child&#39;&quot; 

I kiss her passionately after hearing those words, holding her close 
to me. She moans and deepens it. I slowly break the kiss and embrace 
her. She smiles and rests her forehead against my chest. I stroke down 
her back, finally letting lose of all my feelings for her. I notice 
she has fallen asleep. She looks like an angel as I cover us both with 
the sheets. I watch her sleep and whisper quietly, &quot;I will always love 
you, Princess Amelia wil Telsa Saillune.&quot;
