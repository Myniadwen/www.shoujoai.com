******************************

&lt;190097 BC ()&gt;
The landscape was one born out of a picture book, a fairytale beauty 
telling about a pompous, wealthy kingdom where none would have to 
suffer.
	First impression often clouds the eyes for the real truth behind 
it all.
	Oh sure, the setting was beautiful. The palace sitting in the 
middle of the vast silvery lake - Mare Serenitas - shone with a 
glorious light reflecting the strong heart, the inner soul&#39;s light of 
its creator. High in the sky hung the blue planet from which we had 
all come, the wounds inflicted throughout the short - relatively 
spoken - but bloody war were healing fast and the people of both Moon 
and Earth had been given a new hope, a new peace.
	All was well since Serenity had established the Moon Kingdom... 
At least to the casual observer, to the common people. However, if you 
were one of those that only three years ago fought for the survival of 
the entire galaxy, the ones who had made all this possible. For them 
the results seemed barely worth the personal sacrifices.
	Lady Peitho found her quarry on the balcony of the palace, 
looking out over the water, her gaze seemingly losing itself in the 
depths of space. Yet Peitho could tell with one glance exactly where 
her mate&#39;s focus was directed to... and the realization made her 
stomach lurch, her heart clench and her soul cry out in denial of what 
she knew was impossible to avert. She stood there for a long time, 
gazing at the lovely profile of the young woman, her albino-white skin 
shimmering against the illumination from the Earth above, just like 
the hair took a momentary effect of crystallized purple, a kind of 
halo effect, like an angel. Her angel.
	For as long as she could remember the Senshi of Saturn and her 
had been together and there wasn&#39;t a time when they had been separated 
from each other for more than a few days. The bond between them was a 
natural one, a strong one that knew no boundaries and would be 
sustained to the ends of time if necessary. It was only that vague 
hope that had kept Peitho going over the last days ever since learning 
of the last terrible blow fate had dealt them. Now though, seeing her 
beloved like this, on this very day, that hope was simply not 
enough...
	Lady Phoebe turned in time to receive the embrace properly, 
Peitho clinging to her in desperation and longing, a million thoughts, 
words and feelings tumbling through her but none were expressed 
vocally. It wasn&#39;t necessary. The kiss they shared told everything 
there needed to be said and yet, at the same time, it felt like so 
little, not enough, not enough to diminish the soul-shattering pain in 
themselves. Nothing could. Their auras flared in response to the 
emotional outburst. Golden-orange and purple dancing like hungry 
flames around them, hissing warningly at the world around the two 
lovers that wished to separate them.
	Finally they pulled apart but only so that Peitho could pull the 
smaller girl closer again, not ready to let go at all. She would never 
be ready. &quot;It&#39;s not fair,&quot; she whispered, tears spilling from her 
eyes, tears of anger and frustration, tears of helplessness. &quot;It&#39;s not 
worth it. Lina, Amelia, Sylphiel and even Persephone had to die, poor 
Filia is... And Tsunami left too...&quot; she choked out with an angry sob. 
&quot;What is all this worth if everything is taken away from us? Didn&#39;t we 
earn ourselves anything?&quot; Peitho wanted to curse, rant, lament at the 
unfairness of fate, she wanted to never let go of that sweet woman 
that meant more than life to her. And yet she knew she could not. In 
the end they would all fulfill their duty, no matter the cost. That 
was the harsh destiny of a star child. A life that could bring both 
incredible joy but also incredible pain.
	&quot;I know, Araine. I know,&quot; the usual calm and collected Phoebe 
responded in kind, not able to hold back her own tears. Again the two 
Senshi&#39;s lips met and the flames of light around them were dancing 
even more passionately, hissing even louder... for they knew 
instinctively that it would be the last time. The last time those two 
souls would come together so intimately.
	&quot;I love you so much. I wish I could go with you,&quot; Peitho 
breathed, her vision blurry but her heart clearly seeing and 
imprinting the image of her life&#39;s anchor before her. It would be the 
last memory and it would be burned into her very essence, never to be 
forgotten.
	&quot;I love you too,&quot; Phoebe whispered, trying to sound strong but 
failing miserably. &quot;Take care of Serenity, she needs you now.&quot; There 
was a silent plea in her purple eyes that needn&#39;t to be spoken aloud 
and Peitho nodded even though her heart and soul were screaming to 
just go with the other woman, to ignore everything else and follow her 
mate... She didn&#39;t listen. She couldn&#39;t listen. All what would have 
been truly worthless if she didn&#39;t stay by their young charge&#39;s - now 
Queen&#39;s - side. Peitho knew that if they would both leave, the young 
Queen they both loved and had raised like their own child would not be 
able to bear the heavy duty.
	Peitho and Phoebe&#39;s eyes never left each other, seeing the depth 
of the emotions swimming within their clear pools even beyond the 
tears. &quot;Promise me,&quot; Peitho pressed out before her voice would fully 
fail her. &quot;Promise me that you will find me again. Regardless of how 
long it takes. Promise you&#39;ll find me again and even if I changed and 
don&#39;t recognize you anymore that you...&quot;
	Phoebe pressed a single finger against the older woman&#39;s lips. 
&quot;I promise.&quot; And with that she stepped back, slipping from Peitho&#39;s 
grasp even if the other feebly tried to hold on, the flames separated 
with a snap and a hiss... one might have even heard a wail. The purple 
one curled around its Mistress, forming the familiar Senshi fuku, the 
traditional uniform of a Sailorsenshi. The long scythe, known as the 
Silence Glaive, fell into one outstretched hand and with a wave of 
that deadly instrument a portal was created from nowhere. Sailorsaturn 
gave a long, suffering last glance at her mate, turned and walked 
through the portal that would lead her home... and yet so far away 
from it at the same time.
	As the portal closed behind the Senshi of Silence, Peitho turned 
around, mimicking the position her mate had taken when she first came 
here, her gaze following the same path as Phoebe, towards the planet 
of Saturn. In that moment of finality all the hope was gone. She knew 
without a doubt that Phoebe wouldn&#39;t return in this life. The 
dimensional rift would take much longer to close, especially on a 
nexus planet like Saturn. Her heart, her soul, her essence would not 
come back...
	As tears and sobs overtook her, she was only dimly aware of 
another having come up behind her, holding her trembling form. She was 
only dimly aware of being cradled like a small child by the young 
ruler whose heart was breaking for her last remaining Senshi and 
adoptive mother...
	First the brave three mages she had had so little time to really 
get to know had sacrificed themselves for sealing Pandora and poor 
Pluto had to see her sister suffer the same fate, unable to stop it 
because it had been the only option available. It wasn&#39;t a surprise 
that the remaining Time Guardian had cut herself off from everything, 
retreating to the gate. Then Tsunami had left, leaving Serenity 
feeling confused and betrayed even though she tried so hard to 
understand her sister&#39;s motivation. And now, now they had discovered a 
dimensional rift on Saturn, obviously an aftereffect from the energies 
unleashed in the war. Normally, that wouldn&#39;t be that huge of a 
problem. But the special status of Saturn, being a nexus of ley lines 
and dimensions, made it a delicate matter. If not properly dealt with, 
the rift could unleash horrors upon the galaxy that would ruin 
everything they had fought so hard to create.
	And only one could properly deal with it. Even if it meant 
damning her to a long, lonely vigil.
	&quot;Why, Sere-chan? Why?&quot;
	Queen Serenity, first monarch of the Moon Kingdom, founder of 
the Silver Millennium had no answer. She had no answer at all.

******************************

	The year 2001. The world has entered the new Millennium and the 
birth of a new age is proclaimed. Yet, the true birth is still to 
come, now in tangible distance. The Senshi prepare for the promised 
rebirth of their kingdom, enjoying the last months of normal life.
	But while events unforeseen begin to shatter the tranquility and 
happiness of their everyday life, in the shadows something old and 
absolute dark is stirring. Soon it will show its face and then, then 
the true battle will begin...

******************************

&lt;Present Time, relatively spoken (Minako)&gt;
Shame. Shame and guilt.
	The feelings were so strong that they set my soul afire. Not 
that it made much of a difference in the eternal swirl of agony caging 
my life&#39;s essence. The memories were unrelenting. Scenes from distant 
to close past, from this life and the previous... and the one before 
that... Yet, that one memory was the nexus, the spark that set aflame 
the oil spilt over my soul, letting it explode in an all consuming 
blaze. Shame rippled through ever fiber of my being as I remembered 
the countless opportunities, as I relived the heartfelt tries of 
Makoto and Hotaru. The love they so selfless offered and that I had 
pushed away again and again, taking a small eternity to even 
acknowledge it and never returning it properly. Now I could see them 
as what they were, barriers pushed aside, overridden by the onslaught 
upon my soul, relentless and merciless. And I would have ried with 
shame and guilt at the pain I had caused them if I possessed a 
physical form to do so.
	I saw again and recognized now the spiral that had unconsciously 
begun so long ago that had since then made me reject true love, a 
vicious cycle that had begun on that lone balcony on the Moon and had 
been intensified in this life throughout many other, smaller events. 
That wasn&#39;t an excuse, of course. Just a realization. A shameful and 
guilty one.
	Anger and frustration.
	They were easy feelings to succumb to, safe havens... or so I 
thought. It was easy to loath destiny for all it had done to us, for 
all it kept doing to us. Every time we thought we were happy, 
something would come and take it away from us, tearing at our souls, 
ripping our hearts out. It was unfair, plainly and simply unfair.
	What had we done to deserve this? What had we done but 
sacrificing our lives, our youths, our dreams, again and again, for 
what we believed in, what we wished to protect. Why then, why did we 
never seem to gain a reward...
	And yet the anger at circumstances was only a temporary haven 
after all, not a safe one by far. Those feelings burnt inwards, 
pointing back at me, showing me all the opportunities I had been 
given, all the opportunities I had allowed to pass me by in my own 
ignorance and ridiculous refusal of love...
	Disgust.
	Anger and frustration eventually turned to disgust, shame and 
guilt melting together into a hot searing flare of self-loathing. 
Ultimately all this was just another big excuse. An excuse for my 
failure. I had tried to rationalize my actions in the face of duty but 
by doing that had refused the very thing that made me able to perform 
that duty. I had tried to follow one path... and ultimately failed on 
both.
	I had pushed them away when all that they wanted to give me was 
love, the one thing I had yearned for so long but refused to grant 
myself. They had pushed onwards regardless and I had even taken 
advantage of that... However, never once had I been able to say what 
my heart was whispering to me. Reluctant, afraid...
	Disgusting. Why? Why had I been so damn stubborn? They were 
promising me so much, so much I had longed for, so much I wished to 
give myself. Why did I keep holding onto that illusion, those walls? 
Why had I built them in the first place?
	I knew why. Now, I knew. And the truth was disgusting me only 
further. I had honestly thought, made myself believe that I was 
following the right path, the path meant for me... And in the end all 
I had accomplished was following the one that led me further and 
further away from it.
	As I watched the flashes of memory pass me by, my life... lives 
replaying in a never-ending cycle of agony, a silent scream of terror 
was lodged on the edge of release but it would never be voiced, never 
be heard, never be acknowledged. Never be released. This was worse 
than hell. Conscious thought was lost to me ever since entering here. 
I wasn&#39;t even aware of how much time had passed, of where exactly 
&quot;here&quot; was. Only one thing I was aware of. No light fell here. Not in 
the sense of illumination. I could see very well. Could see all those 
deeply buried memories coaxing forth the emotions of shame, guilt, 
anger, frustration, disgust and so much more. They weren&#39;t bright 
memories. None of them were. It was an endless spiral of agony, 
forcing me to see, relive, experience again and again not only the 
emotions I wished never to remember from those situations, but also 
making me see now what they really were, adding further to the 
torment.
	And below me I could feel more than see the abyss, waiting to 
devour my soul completely. I would probably have welcomed it at this 
point if not for the undeniable, foreboding sense that it would not 
bring release but only further torment... with the only difference of 
finality. I didn&#39;t really realize how I knew all this, probably a 
distant recognition, a survival instinct from Peitho. And yet I 
wondered why I was even struggling. Why was I still fighting back, 
refusing to let myself fall completely? I had lost. I had failed in 
everything. My duty and my very reason for being. I had failed those 
that loved me, failed to protect Makoto and Hotaru properly, failed to 
ever return their love, failed Usagi consequently because I could not 
be there anymore to protect her, probably failed the child in me, the 
only evidence of success in my life, regardless of how unwillingly 
conceived... Yes, I had failed...
	&#39;But I shall be damned if I give up.&#39; Serenity never gave up, 
Usagi never gave up. None of us ever gave up. And I, Sailorvenus, 
sworn leader of the Princess&#39; guard would not either!
	The brief spark of resistance against the unbearable torment 
would have been insignificant. In fact the next moment it had almost 
been extinguished again by another painful memory hammering another 
needle into the core of my soul. It wouldn&#39;t have made a difference... 
if not for the echo it received.
	For a timeless moment the darkness slowly devouring my soul, 
feasting upon it until nothing was left, was disrupted by a soft 
bluish light. The memories were stopped, cut apart by ten beautiful 
wing-like objects of purest life force, as if creating a tunnel, a 
tunnel at which&#39;s end I could see the flare of emerald green and deep 
purple, a surge of unconditional, overwhelming love pouring over me 
like a tsunami and yet so gentle like a morning breeze.
	I didn&#39;t hesitate a moment, knowing beyond doubt that fate had 
just presented me with another, a last opportunity, an opportunity to 
make all that right again that I had did wrong. This time I didn&#39;t 
question the feelings from the spheres of light anymore but accepted 
and embraced them, letting myself be pulled towards them on invisible 
bonds formed between us without even realizing it.
	Darkness turned into light as I was pulled inside the protective 
circle of the wings and in-between the safety of the two souls that I 
could now acknowledge to love beyond doubt. One old, one new, but both 
of infinite worth to me. The pain and agony was forgotten for the 
moment as I was cradled, bathed in their light and love like a newborn 
child...

(Lisa)
I had been trained for spiritual assaults like this. Both in this life 
as much as Sylphiel had, even more so the latter. I knew from her 
memories what to expect, I knew the symptoms and it was nothing more 
than just that spiritual attack, an attack that could be overcome when 
you were strong enough...
	It wasn&#39;t nearly enough to prepare one for the true trauma.
	Cut off from the source feeding the terror wasn&#39;t enough as I 
realized in some detached corner of my mind. The memories were nearly 
impossible to be held at bay and ignored for the brief time in which I 
had resisted... tried to resist HER they now came back like a tsunami 
briefly stopped by an obstacle, with even more force and vehemence.
	Flames. A ship on the open ocean was alight with crimson tongues 
of destruction. I was crying, held protectively in my father&#39;s arms, 
too young to really comprehend but knowing instinctively that 
something bad had happened to my mother and cousin that were still 
there, having been unable to reach one of the lifeboats in time.
	An eruption of heat and blinding light. I had to shield my eyes 
even as I kept up the barrier to stabilize the Raywing. I could feel 
the power underneath striking the shield with impossible force. I 
didn&#39;t know what happened but my heart felt cold, something having 
been torn away... again. I could hear them talking in awe but only 
Amelia&#39;s comment about what happened to the city made me blink against 
the blinding effect of the power eruption. And then my eyes settled on 
Sairaag... or what had once been Sairaag, an anguished scream of 
denial tumbling from lips...
	Flames again. The heat was nearly unbearable. I knew beyond 
doubt that without Soyo-chan&#39;s two layer air bubble that had formed a 
zone totally devoid of any air I would have been only a pile of ash 
for a long time already. I stumbled through the fire disorientated, my 
mind foggy not only from some of the little acid smoke I must have 
inhaled but also because the fire had surprised me in the middle of 
the night. I tried to push that back, intently focusing on finding my 
parents, hoping against hope...
	The hope was crushed replaced by a feeling of aching loneliness 
when I stumbled into the remains of the bedroom...
	Everything came back to fire in the end. Fire had taken away my 
family, in both lives, I couldn&#39;t separate the memories anymore. The 
dark and twisted reality having taken a front seat in my soul, like a 
parasite. I tried to fight it off, suppress the memories but I 
couldn&#39;t. They had been too fast, too intense. The haunting fire was 
tearing at, feeding on my fears and grief, on the guilt of not having 
been able to prevent either event. Somehow I had always managed to 
stay alive even though I felt like dying myself. More than once I had 
wished that I had just been claimed by the fire too, sparing me the 
grief and remorse. I had loathed at fate, finding it unfair, wondering 
why I survived and my family did not. And now, with Sylphiel&#39;s 
memories returning I could see that this dark shadow seemed to have 
followed me into this life as well. And again, I had survived, forced 
to watch and experience the death of my family, the only one who 
survived the inferno thanks to Soyo-chan...
	&#39;Soyo-chan!&#39;
	I clang to the sudden spark of concern, fueling my resistance, 
recalling the image of the broken form of my best friend, the only one 
who had ever truly understood and completed in this life. The one who 
had spent so much time and energy into helping me overcoming my 
parents&#39; death, breaking through the haze of depression that had 
settled over me after the incident.
	I couldn&#39;t succumb to this now. There were still people who 
needed me, people that I could protect. Soyo-chan and... and...
	There was the fire again but this time I didn&#39;t feel repelled by 
the image burning into my mind. It came right from the core of my 
soul, stronger than any of the others. The fire wasn&#39;t consuming but 
cleansing. I could see a shadowy figure, red hair and a blowing 
cape...
	&#39;Lina!&#39;
	*Girls are supposed to be cheerful.*
	I had clung to that after the events in Sairaag, after losing my 
father to Copy Rezo, after I had time to really let the truth settle 
in. And it had helped. And it helped now. They needed me, they needed 
me to be strong. I could feel the anxiety from the Soul Link that was 
still there even as unused and dim as it was. The concern and love 
flowing through it filled me with new strength. That was what I had 
been searching. All those years and especially after my brief visit to 
the Jinja here. It had been their awakening souls calling me then. Now 
I understood, I understood the restlessness I had felt all my life and 
the dreams that had started shortly after my visit here.
	They were searching for me, waiting, even after all this time, 
the bond, the promise between us had not weakened. This was our second 
chance... And I would not, COULD NOT let it slip away again! True I 
had wished to die after the blows that fate had dealt me in both lives 
but at the same time there always had been something giving my life 
meaning. Father, Lina, Soyo-chan... They all made me realize in their 
own ways, conscious or not, that there would always be something left 
worth living for.
	I reached out mentally towards the link bonding us together and 
my heart leapt a little at the enthusiastic response from Lina and the 
little bit more reserved but equally honest one from Amelia. Reassured 
that their worry was diminished for the moment I focused inward again, 
searching for the other link that led to my elemental friend. The 
state in which I found the gentle Sylph elemental briefly staggered me 
in my newfound enthusiasm but I firmed my resolve. I would be damned 
if I let another one of those dear to me slip away. I had the ability, 
I had the power and this life, the travels and experiences as Lisa had 
also given me a new kind of confidence.
	My mana flared in response to my thoughts and wisps of white and 
holy gold began to form around the small form of the elemental. I 
fought back a wave of exhaustion the recent attack and keeping the 
terror at bay had left inside of me, intently focusing on Soyo-chan. 
As Sylphiel my grasp on the elemental concept had been meager at best. 
But now, through my trusted friend I had a new angle to work with and 
so it was much easier to draw Air mana directly from the Astral Plane, 
mixing it with the healing energy to repair the Sylph&#39;s spiritual 
matrix.
	The process was complex and tedious, especially in my current 
state, with only recently reawakened memories, a spirit that wasn&#39;t 
quite adjusted yet to draw upon so much holy power... I worked fast 
but precisely, knowing that neither of us had much time. I could rest 
afterwards. Now, only the healing was important.
	A sigh of relief escaped my spiritual lips as I sensed the 
elemental&#39;s own survival instincts kicking in, not to mention the 
Sylph&#39;s natural ability to draw strength from their environment. Only 
a moment later golden eyelashes fluttered open and I felt myself 
momentarily distracted by the grateful smile and that... endearing 
gaze, wondering once again just how deep the Sylph&#39;s affection run. 
Before my friend could say something though, my focus blurred and I 
had just enough sense of self-preservation to retreat my spirit fully 
back into my physical body before blissful unconsciousness claimed me.

******************************

(Jupiter)
At the moment where the anger took hold I lost all kind of rational 
control. The inability to do something, the surreal state of being 
incapable to prevent the horrifying scene unfolding in front of my 
eyes had pushed past all the layers of control I had mastered in the 
span of my recent training. A fury unlike I had ever felt bubbled 
forth from the depths of the inner volcano and my chi responded in 
kind.
	The aura probably had been something between dark crimson slowly 
turning to black. That should have warned me of how far I had been 
gone into the rage sparked through the moment, but as I was I didn&#39;t 
notice and probably didn&#39;t care either. All I knew was that my 
friends... my lovers had gotten hurt by this thing, the sight of 
Minako being impaled like this and that look of utter terror only 
thickened the red haze...
	I almost resented the interruption, wishing... WANTING to vent 
my anger, needing a release for the guilt at my failure and the 
concern for Minako. Looking back, I wondered if a release of such 
negative chi would have doomed the other girl. Of course, I wasn&#39;t so 
reasonable in that moment and watched in a helpless state of 
frustration as things unfolded almost too fast to follow, with a 
precision and harmony that spoke of high quality teamwork I found hard 
to imagine given that the participants only knew each other for 
roughly two years...
	The arrow hit its target with amazing accuracy, the... limb - or 
whatever it was the creature had used to attack - was not severed 
though but practically consumed in a burst of intense light. Before I 
could even comprehend that the Seeker stumbled back as a massive... 
boomerang hit it in the head, followed by a burst of fire.
	&quot;MARS SNAKE FIRE!&quot;
	Just like the name suggest an angrily hissing snake of flames 
wrapped itself around the creature. However, this was only a 
short-lived success as the Seeker collapsed into its blob-shaped form, 
escaping the fire and reforming again into the vaguely human-shaped 
body. It had to instantly defend itself again though, obviously still 
disorientated at the loss of its &#39;hand&#39;. It was the green-haired 
Mitsuki now that literally exploded in a vicious dance with two 
bluish-white blades of pure energy...
	I blinked. I knew there was something about all of them but 
that... I shook my head, not having quite yet let go of my own anger, 
and more than ready to do my own share of inflicting revenge on the 
creature that had dared to hurt one of those that I loved...
	&quot;It&#39;s not too late yet.&quot;
	Sasami&#39;s voice drained the last bit of anger - not the 
frustration though - as I spun around to see Hotaru... no, Saturn on 
the ground cradling an unconscious Minako... or Venus, something 
in-between probably. Not that it mattered! All that mattered was the 
flash of feeble hope briefly overriding the shock and deep concern on 
Saturn&#39;s face. I opened my mouth to say something but never got the 
words out.
	&quot;Quickly now, her soul&#39;s almost beyond reach.&quot; The blue-haired 
girl gestured and I moved before I even realized my brain had given 
the command to kneel on one side of Minako, Saturn moving to the 
other. I wasn&#39;t quite sure what was going on or what the other girl 
was planning to do but the fact that my other lover seemed to trust 
her completely was enough to extinguish any feelings of doubt before 
they arose. Besides, Hotaru had told us about Pandora&#39;s minions 
specialty that involved having the victim&#39;s soul succumb to eternal 
agony, and just the thought of the grave and cruel description having 
been applied to Minako now was... was...
	&quot;We have no time to waste. Take one of her hands each and give 
me your other.&quot; Sasami was kneeling at the blonde&#39;s head now as we 
instinctively did as told. The sounds of battle had faded into the 
background and while I was worried that worry was quickly overridden 
by the burning ache in my heart at the almost lifeless sight of my 
pregnant lover... &#39;Oh kami, the child!&#39; With all control I could 
master I forced down the panic, concentrating on the task at hand, one 
thing at a time.
	&quot;What now?&quot; I asked and almost didn&#39;t recognize the cracked 
whisper that came out as my own.
	&quot;Now we have to guide her soul back. You have to concentrate. 
Focus on the bond between you, on the love that you feel for her. Let 
that and only that dominate your thoughts.&quot; A part of me wanted to 
protest, wanted to say that there wasn&#39;t a bond between us to begin 
with, that Minako was Hotaru&#39;s, just as Peitho had been Phoebe&#39;s... 
The frustration at my earlier failure only fueled that thought despite 
everything that the younger girl had said. Yet, my own problems didn&#39;t 
matter here, insignificant in the face of what had to be done here. If 
I couldn&#39;t do anything else for them, at least I had to do something 
to save Minako now. So I pushed back and momentarily banished those 
concerns out of my mind and heart, focusing rather on the positive 
feelings, shining strongly like a sun.
	I closed my eyes, a tingling of intense, pure energy surrounding 
us like a bubble giving me pause for a moment, and then I made myself 
remember all that which I loved about our blonde leader. From the 
first nuances of kinship, over a strong friendship blossoming from 
equal, repressed loneliness, finally turning the first seeds of love 
on my part. I pictured in my mind the cheerful smile that I had been 
missing so much in the last years. I could picture the confidence that 
seemed to settle in whenever she became Venus, the intuitive skill and 
grasp on a situation so vital to a true leader. Minako was a complex 
person even if she had denied one of those aspects lately and I 
admired and loved both sides of her, wished nothing more than to see 
her genuinely smiling and happy again, even if it was with Hotaru. I 
didn&#39;t care, as long as she was alive and well...
	I gasped, feeling a response. The sensation was incredible. A 
bit like the spiritual link that Rei had used to access the blocked 
memories. While not a complete merge, it was still more potent, on a 
much deeper level than just the human spirit which only left one 
thing...
	Intense warmth flooded me as my senses were temporally 
overwhelmed by such strong positive emotions from the other two. I 
concentrated hard on what I thought had to be Minako&#39;s soul, reaching 
out and feeling Hotaru join me in the action. I had no idea how I even 
knew what to do, this went far beyond any mental training I had ever 
undergone so far. I acted on impulse, letting myself drift with the 
flow. A burst of joy filled my heart as I could feel Minako respond.
	&#39;Come back to us!&#39; I practically willed mentally and she did. 
With a gasp I felt the connection cut... No, not cut. It was still 
there. I could reach out and feel it... whatever &quot;it&quot; was. Warm, 
comforting... loving. I shook my head at the spinning sensation. Again 
I was distracted for a short duration as I actually saw what had 
sparked the sensation of purity before. The four of us were enveloped 
in a veil of blue-green light, soft and comforting, with ten glaring 
white blade-like shapes forming some sort of protective ring around 
us. My mind boggled at the power level I picked up. This was pretty 
much as potent as Usagi&#39;s own power!
	&quot;She&#39;s okay,&quot; Sasami&#39;s voice drew my attention back to more 
pressing matters. I glanced down at the blonde woman and noted that 
the terror in her face seemed to have melted, she almost looked 
peaceful. But the other girl&#39;s tone hadn&#39;t conveyed relief yet and I 
noted that Minako&#39;s body seemed to sudden shake with tremors, her head 
jerking and mouth opening as if screaming but no sound came out. 
Eyelashes fluttered once, twice, but eyes remained closed, apparently 
caught between the exhausted unconsciousness and the physical need to 
do... Yes, to do what?
	&quot;Kami, the baby!&quot; Saturn breathed and I gasped in response, the 
previous ignored panic exploding full-force. Almost out of reflex I 
reached for my communicator. Surely Ami could...
	&quot;No time for that,&quot; Sasami again interrupted, cast a brief, 
worried look beyond the veil of energy and closed her eyes for a brief 
moment. The markings on her forehead - which I dimly noted had changed 
somewhat - flared white for a moment before...
	I gaped at the short flare of a crescent moon sigil but never 
got past the stage of opening my mouth, before pinkish-red eyes 
snapped open again in determination. The next thing I knew was that we 
were somewhere else entirely...

******************************

()
On one of the main streets in Minato-ku Usagi and Mamoru walked 
alongside each other, having decided to take a relaxing walk. The last 
weeks had been busy with the revelations from Hotaru and the more than 
possible threat looming over everyone&#39;s heads like an executioner&#39;s 
blade. After conferring with the others Usagi had pushed an increase 
in training regiment for those physical capable of it. Not that she 
didn&#39;t trust in her friend&#39;s abilities but considering what they were 
about to face, it was better to be prepared. Besides, it gave everyone 
some way of releasing tension and frustration at being unable to do 
something in advance.
	Usagi didn&#39;t want to fight again. She would have been fine if 
Galaxia had really been the last of her enemies. Going toe to toe with 
the Galactic Chaos was more than enough. That experience though, that 
and the long years in between then and now had made her more mature. 
Nowadays she was aware of and felt the heavy burden of royal linage, 
the mantle she would soon take... WHEN - and not if - they survived 
this. She had learned to make decisions like this, the right ones, 
even if she herself didn&#39;t like them. They had fought too long and 
hard to allow this situation to take it all away again.
	The last week had taken its toll on her. Outwardly she hoped 
that no one had noticed, having applied the &quot;Queen Mask&quot;. Only her 
husband knew how worried she was for everyone. It was hard not to. 
Hotaru had obviously restrained herself in explaining the threat that 
this Pandora posed and even then the fear in her voice and eyes had 
been visible for everyone. Who wouldn&#39;t be concerned when even the 
usual cold Saturn was?
	The couple was a few steps away from the Crown Fruit Parlor when 
Usagi suddenly stopped cold. Mamoru, walking beside her, halted 
abruptly, staring worriedly and not sure what to do as a faraway look 
momentarily crossed Usagi&#39;s features before blue eyes cleared again, 
only to be taken over by an expression of grim determination. Her 
posture spoke of deep concern for a moment before muscles tightened 
and her warrior nature took over, something that Mamoru hadn&#39;t seen in 
a long time. It had always been Usagi or Serenity, but there hadn&#39;t 
been much need for Sailormoon outside of regular training.
	Without hesitation he followed his wife when Usagi slipped into 
a side alley, glancing around for any onlookers. No sooner had he 
given a nod of confirmation, a blazing light already erupted from 
Usagi and without a word or seemingly concentration the transformation 
washed over her, large wings instead of the usual ones for her Eternal 
form enfolding.
	&quot;I&#39;m needed elsewhere,&quot; Sailormoon said simply. &quot;Call Ami, I 
think we might need the hospital ready.&quot; And with that she took off, 
leaving the dark-haired man behind rather puzzled by the sudden 
departure and lack of proper explanation. Not that he didn&#39;t trust 
Usagi to know what she was doing. He was sure she would have told him 
more if she had the time. Which obviously wasn&#39;t the case.
	It took a moment for him to process her last request and another 
to figure out the meaning. Grimacing, his mouth pressed into a hard, 
thin line, he turned sharply and began walking swiftly while with one 
hand taking the cell phone from its pocket.

******************************

(Sakura)
I had blocked out the sounds of battle, my gaze fixed on the young 
miko. A thousand and one sensations were coursing through me. Once 
again I had failed her. After all this time spent searching, this 
ending was just too unfair. There was nothing either of us could do. 
The injury wasn&#39;t physical lethal but instead went right down to the 
soul. And no spell, be it all so powerful could heal that. She might 
be separated from the source of the torment now but by experience I 
knew that even brief contact with a Soul Thief had dire consequences.
	I glanced up helplessly at Tomoyo on Lisa&#39;s other side and was 
surprised... no, shaken actually to see my own deep concern reflected 
there. Tomoyo had always been a gentle soul who&#39;d worry about all 
those around her, but that level of sorrow that I saw in stormy blue 
eyes, so much like the own mix of anguish and sadness in my heart... I 
had only ever seen such intensity directed at me. Suddenly I felt very 
ashamed for ever doubting my mate&#39;s feelings on the whole issue. Often 
the dark-haired girl would put back her own feelings on a topic if it 
meant not too worry, despite how much I encouraged her not to and so I 
hadn&#39;t been able to help but wonder...
	&quot;Can&#39;t we do anything?&quot; Tomoyo asked softly, her voice barely 
above a whisper.
	I held her gaze for a moment, searching blue eyes for any sign 
of... I didn&#39;t even know what I was searching for! All I knew was that 
I didn&#39;t find it. Which was sort of a relief. &quot;We can only be there 
for her and hope she makes it through,&quot; I said, drawing strength from 
her presence and feeling a spark of confidence... or maybe it was just 
stubbornness. &quot;She&#39;s a strong person. She... she can make it. I&#39;m sure 
of it. W-we have to believe her...&quot; I shook my head angrily at my own 
shaky voice. As much as I was surprised by Tomoyo&#39;s reaction, that 
same sad and anxious look directed back at me, it hurt, hurt deep 
inside me, steering my own heartache for the girl between us. I wanted 
to give Tomoyo some assurance to latch on too, but...
	&quot;I... I think so too...&quot; Tomoyo said, her voice low, nearly 
breaking. Eyes locked for a moment of mutual pain and aggravating 
concern we looked down at Lisa&#39;s prone form and gasped in unison at 
the faint, brief flicker of gold. A small smile broke through the 
depressed expression I surely had to be wearing. &#39;That&#39;s it, fight 
back.&#39; Pride temporally pushed away guilt and worry and then changed 
into shock. Pleasant shock at that.
	I hadn&#39;t dared to touch it. I was aware that the Soul Link 
between us was still there. That hadn&#39;t even surprised me that much. 
Soul bindings were eternal. I could probably have done something about 
it all the time. Maybe the link could have even helped us find Lisa 
earlier. But I was afraid, afraid to provoke a negative reaction, 
afraid that maybe, somehow Pandora would take note of it and... do 
something... something like that.
	Irrational fears, I knew, since those links were quite safe, but 
still at the back of my mind. My main reason was though that a link 
between soul mates was something sacred. Touching it, acknowledging 
its presence, that meant you acknowledged the other as your chosen 
mate and the union between you as true, honest and meant to be. While 
I had no problem with that, using the link to track down Sylphiel&#39;s 
reincarnation would eventually led to making that choice for her. And 
at that time I didn&#39;t know how similar they were. And even if I had, I 
would have never done something like that to another person. If there 
was to be a revival of what had once been, it would be a conscious 
one. I would never violate the bond between us like that.
	And so infinite joy flooded me at the moment when I felt Lisa do 
just that. I could feel her soul mingling with Tomoyo&#39;s and my own, 
drawing strength and confidence, while at the same time reassuring. I 
had dared hope for this, I had often lain awake at night, thinking of 
the old times and wondering if... wishing that it might be like then 
again. And now, for a brief moment the space that for all the love 
between Tomoyo and me had been left vacant was filled. Completion, 
harmony, balance. It felt so... beautiful, simply right beyond any 
doubt. I could feel Tomoyo&#39;s joy too and basked at the short but 
wonderful sensation giving me new courage. Lisa&#39;s presence drew back 
slightly but in my heart I knew that this would only be temporally.
	I looked at Tomoyo again and again saw the happiness in my heart 
reflected in her radiant face. We shared a relieved smile. It was 
going to be alright. Maybe Pandora had succeeded in breaking part of 
the seal, but she hadn&#39;t been able to claim Lisa in the process. She 
had been strong enough to resist and she wasn&#39;t giving up now.
	A momentary flare of Lisa&#39;s aura attracted me again as I could 
feel some sort of deep concentration coming from the girl, just before 
her body went limp and if we hadn&#39;t been holding her, she would have 
collapsed on the ground. For a moment worry returned but Tomoyo 
quickly reached over to check her pulse and nodded gently. &quot;She&#39;ll be 
fine. Just exhausted.&quot;
	&quot;That&#39;s...&quot; I started in relief before my awareness was suddenly 
drawn back to the all too close action still escalating a few paces 
away. My head snapped around when Time... or Persephone - we really 
would have had a talk about that one - collided with the ground not 
too far away from us. I narrowed my eyes at the clearly battered but 
still very much dangerous Seeker. Fine dark mist was floating around 
it and the skin was turning pitch black. I instinctively knew what it 
meant.
	&quot;It seems Pandora is not too happy with me interfering,&quot; 
Persephone stated, getting up again. &quot;And I can&#39;t unfold my full 
powers on this plane as I am.&quot; Her gaze was fixed on the growling 
creature ready to explode into action every moment. The mists around 
it were thickening and the body adjusted to them, distorting its form 
to an even more bestial one, more threatening... it gave the danger 
the creature presented a more fitting look, though I really would have 
done without. It was obvious that Pandora was feeding her henchman 
power in order to get rid of us right away. But why take that risk, 
even with one third gone, it had to take her a lot of concentration 
and energy to channel this much power. Especially so soon.
	I glanced back at Tomoyo and then Lisa, a cold feeling making me 
shiver as I realized one thing. We were all here. All three 
maintainers of the seal. &quot;Crap,&quot; I cursed. &quot;Tomoyo, get Lisa inside 
and stay there,&quot; I ordered, my mind slipping into combat mode. My 
other mate looked for a moment like she would protest but I obviously 
looked stubborn enough to make her comply with only a moment&#39;s 
hesitation. However, right at that moment the now enhanced Seeker shot 
forward and I had barely time to react. A strategy hadn&#39;t yet formed 
and so we probably would have been caught off guard at the moment if 
not for the sudden explosion of golden-yellow from Lisa&#39;s body. I 
noticed the wind picking up ferocity around us for a short moment 
before the small, harmless seeming creature exploded forward with a 
cry of anguish totally uncharacteristically for her kind... even if 
understandable under the current circumstances of her obvious 
mistress&#39; condition.
	&#39;So I was right in my assumption&#39;, I mused, plucking the star 
key from its hiding place just as the Sylph attacked the Seeker who 
had been tumbled backwards by the fierce charge, being caught 
defenseless in the middle of its own attack. I knew that the elemental 
wouldn&#39;t be able to hold it at bay very long. Not alone anyway. 
&quot;WINDY!&quot; I shot a glance back at Tomoyo and nudged my head in the 
direction of the shrine to emphasize my earlier request. The 
dark-haired girl nodded and moved to get Lisa inside.
	I turned back to focus on the battle. There had been a brief 
pause as elemental and card spirit looked at each other and then in 
mutual agreement they had begun to bind the offending creature in 
place. I glanced at Persephone/Time. &quot;What exactly did you mean by not 
having your full powers here?&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m still bound to the card, sort of,&quot; came the somewhat 
chagrinned reply. I grimaced. This was getting better and better. What 
else had Clow managed to temper with unknowingly? Well, okay, that 
wasn&#39;t really fair. For all I knew, we had thought Persephone was 
dead, one of the many sacrifices of the war. So, this really came as a 
surprise, a pleasant one. But there was no time for explanations now.
	&quot;Can I set you free?&quot; Receiving a nod that didn&#39;t have much 
enthusiasm behind it, I frowned. &quot;But I guess we don&#39;t have the time 
for that now, huh?&quot; Another nod and I had to refrain from cursing. We 
were running out of time. The Seeker was snarling and both elementals 
had trouble keeping it occupied. I closed my eyes briefly, a heavy 
sigh escaping my lips. &quot;Guess I have to pull out the big guns after 
all.&quot;
	This would be ugly, especially afterwards.

******************************

(Saturn)
I had allowed myself to be carried onwards by the old memories, 
knowing that there wasn&#39;t much time to waste. I had seen other victims 
of what we  had termed Soul Thieves in general - essentially 
everything working for and tainted by Pandora - and the memories were 
not too comforting. Frankly the panic was there, just beneath the 
surface and I had tried to drown it in trusting that Tsunami knew what 
she was doing. Funny thing that, usually it had been the other way 
around in the old times... But I was far too worried to care about 
that and she seemed confident enough. That she obviously managed to 
get her own abilities honed helped too. I wasn&#39;t sure if I could have 
pulled it off without her. Technically maybe but I had been too 
frantic after Minako took the blow...
	Everything just kept reminding me of that day we parted ways 
over two hundred millennia ago. I hadn&#39;t wanted to go, I could have 
cared less about the rift or about consequences. I had seen so much 
sacrifices, hurt, pain, grief, loss... I didn&#39;t want any more. At the 
same time that was why I had to go. It was the hardest decision I had 
ever made, leaving Peitho after nearly three decades to attend to my 
duty... to protect her and Serenity...
	And now I had almost lost her again. No, not almost. She was 
still in danger. Actually I had been pretty sure the child was lost 
after the assault. I couldn&#39;t fathom how the body adjusted to the 
attack and the brief loss of its soul, still keeping the young seed 
alive. On the other hand this confirmed my earlier theory neatly that 
we weren&#39;t just simply dealing with a normal child created by slight 
magical aid here but something far more potent. If I listened closely 
I could pick up the bright, clear vibes of a star... no, two stars 
pulsing in synch from Minako&#39;s body.
	Well, all those worries and concerns briefly were forgotten as I 
looked around the scene. We were in a rather beautiful setting at the 
base of a giant tree with a small forest around it under the 
illuminating light of a silvery full moon... &#39;Subspace&#39;, I thought, 
extending my senses but not able to pinpoint an exact location or the 
borders of the area. The feedback I got was rather overwhelming, the 
presence residing here was enormous. I glanced up at the tree and my 
consciousness touched something ethereal and ancient for a moment. A 
gasp escaped my lips as I recognized the tree for what it was.
	&quot;I can answer your questions later, Phoebe,&quot; Tsunami&#39;s voice 
snapped me out of my brief shock. &quot;Put her down in the water. This 
isn&#39;t going to be easy.&quot; Her tone was soft but urgent and I knew I was 
wasting precious moments. Minako was shifting through a myriad of 
states, from near wakefulness to unconsciousness, threatening to go 
beyond from the abnormal strain she was physically and spiritually 
subjected to. If we waited much longer, I... we would really lose 
her... again. Both of them.
	Glancing at Jupiter I pleaded with my eyes but needn&#39;t have 
bothered. Obviously she was just as taken by the setting but had 
picked up on the urgency of the situation. I caught a brief glimpse of 
guilt, remorse and frustration from the brunette, hinting at the 
insecurity beneath it and silently resolved to deal with that later. 
After all this was over and everyone was safe... hopefully.
	Wordlessly we picked Minako up and carried her over to the clear 
pond of water all around the base of the tree. Jupiter almost slipped 
for a moment when she stole a glance at the tree. She really did hold 
up great though, given that her sensitivity to nature and plants 
especially probably made her head swim at the moment. I could see her 
hesitate when I began to lower Minako&#39;s head into the water and smiled 
reassuringly, my keen sight having already told me enough to know that 
our mate wouldn&#39;t drown. Hopefully the opposite actually.
	&quot;Can we do anything to... Tsunami?&quot; My voices faltered as I 
looked over to the other girl seeing her glow brightly while she was 
leaning against the tree&#39;s bark with both hands, clearly struggling in 
some manner. Another gasp sprang to my lips as I managed to pick up 
thin but very potent lines coming from the tree, wrapping around 
Tsunami and then going back again. &#39;They&#39;re...&#39; I caught Jupiter&#39;s arm 
as the taller woman started to rise more in agitation than alarm, 
instantly grasping what was going on, though it was hard to 
comprehend... That would give me a massive headache later when I 
allowed myself to sort through all that the other girl had obviously 
gone through...
	&quot;You know what to do...&quot; Tsunami pressed out, her voice visibly 
shaking now as her and the tree&#39;s presence were drawn to each other 
with force and finality. There was a bright flash and when the light 
cleared Tsunami was gone from sight. Not from the plane though.
	&quot;Where is...?&quot; Jupiter started but cut herself off, jumping 
slightly in alarm as roots and branches were extending from the tree 
to secure the blonde laying in the water. I held her gaze, slightly 
shaking my head.
	&quot;Mako-chan, we have to act now. Trust me okay, this is the best 
environment we could have hoped for.&quot; Doubt and anxiety were warring 
in emerald eyes with the wish to trust. Iwas relieved and humbled at 
the slow nod, instinctively knowing how much the other girl was 
fighting her emotions, her overprotective nature rebelling at the 
earlier inability to help in any direct way with the assault. I could 
feel the insecurity leaking through the tentative Soul Link formed to 
coax Minako&#39;s soul back to us. I smiled softly and sadly at the same 
time, recognizing the feelings as some I had briefly entertained 
myself but the seeds of doubt were much greater there. &#39;She&#39;s doubting 
her place with us...&#39;
	&quot;What do we need to do?&quot; Jupiter asked, squirming slightly under 
my gaze.
	&quot;We have to feed the child our power. It&#39;s being made from our 
essences and if I am correct in what I am suspecting, it can only be 
stabilized by all three of us.&quot; I didn&#39;t say out loud that I could 
only hope that Tsunami could stabilize Minako enough for this. &quot;It&#39;s a 
matter of balance.&quot; Technically I was just reciting what I knew. I had 
never experience or seen first-hand a star birth and this was 
unorthodox even for the standard one I hurt about.
	&quot;We? Don&#39;t you mean...&quot;
	I cut Jupiter off by grasping her hand, momentarily pushing back 
my own fear for Minako and trying to convey all the feelings I held 
close to my heart for the brunette. &quot;Yes, we. It&#39;s never been just me, 
Mako-chan. That child, it&#39;s ours. Our baby.&quot;
	&quot;Our...&quot; Jupiter nearly choked on the words.
	I nodded. &quot;If we do this now, it will,&quot; I said warmly, sending a 
wave of love over the link, making the other girl gasp, looking at me 
with wide eyes that then softened, a slow, hesitant smile spreading 
over her lips.
	*Hurry up, she&#39;s not going to hold up any longer!* Both of us 
jumped slightly at Tsunami&#39;s mental voice and our eyes swiveled down 
synchronically to our mate. Glancing back up I took note of the 
serious and confident expression slipping back into place and nodded 
in confirmation.
	&quot;Let&#39;s do this,&quot; Jupiter said, her aura starting to glow, tiara 
vanishing as the green sign of Jupiter blazed free of its confinement.
	&quot;Together,&quot; I agreed, taking one of my two mate&#39;s hands each, 
waiting until Jupiter copied the gesture before flaring my own aura.
	The next moments were hard to describe as every conscious and 
unconscious thought was directed at channeling the necessary energy 
for this to succeed, a small corner resigned to a constant prayer for 
this process&#39; success. I couldn&#39;t lose her again, not after finally 
finding her again. I could lose neither of them. Not Minako, not 
Makoto, not the hopefully-soon-to-be child. They were my family. I 
knew in my heart that my place was with them, all of them and I knew 
that we also could only make this work together. Losing one would 
crush us all. Together we could work this all out and then, after such 
a long time, we might all find some happiness.
	Focusing on these thoughts of love and hope I let myself fall 
and relented control as I felt the large presence enveloping us, 
starting to direct the potent powers.

******************************

(Tomoyo)
Getting Lisa to the shrine when behind you your beloved was waging a 
battle with a very dangerous opponent was difficult enough, add to 
that the fact that the miko wasn&#39;t exactly light weight - not that I 
want to call her heavy either - and I wasn&#39;t exactly strong...
	I made it to the entrance just as a small explosion from behind 
drew my attention. Well, okay, that wouldn&#39;t have been enough to 
worry, but I knew that Sakura wasn&#39;t one to curse easily, and the 
string of choice words that followed now had been rather violent. With 
worried eyes I took in the scene of Time - I had the strangest feeling 
I should know who she really was, Sakura obviously did - and my 
girlfriend squaring off against the creature. The Seeker was now 
sporting vicious looking claws and fangs, as well as a sharp horn just 
above the one eye, all in a dark crimson color. Not to mention that it 
was throwing around spears of some kind of dark energy, making it 
nearly impossible to chant any long term spell... Which obviously was 
the cause for Sakura&#39;s aggravation.
	I tore my gaze away, knowing - as much as it shamed me - that I 
would only be in the way of such a fight. I trusted Sakura that when 
she said I wasn&#39;t ready for that kind of opponent, I didn&#39;t feel ready 
either. I had to trust in her as I always did, that was all which was 
left to me. That and taking care of Lisa. The poor girl had been 
through a lot. I had to admit I admired her for her inner strength. 
Sakura and I had seen and experienced firsthand the terror that 
Pandora could put upon her enemies. The agony the soul would be 
subjected too. I shuddered at the memory. That Lisa had been able to 
actually fight back against such a direct contact so vehemently was 
amazing. It spoke not only of the one sleeping in her but also of a 
very strong character.
	I honestly couldn&#39;t quite say that I was totally without doubt 
about the possibility of adding another to our relationship. The 
memories of the three of us were the most clearest, yes. They also 
were invoking very strong feelings that I again and again found myself 
hoping to experience once more for real. This wasn&#39;t just all about 
Sakura. This was about us. And yes, I did have my doubts. I mean, you 
can&#39;t just go and accept someone else in the love of your life that 
you only know from some vague memories of a past life without at least 
thinking about it. Personally, if I would just let myself decide on 
the memories I knew that I would have no problems with it. But that 
would just be Amelia. I wanted to be sure I could accept that as 
Tomoyo too. I wanted to be fair to either of them...
	The last fleeting doubt had been eradicated that short moment of 
complete harmony. She was meant to be with us and in my heart I could 
admit with complete certainty that if it had been Lisa I first met, I 
would have fallen in love with her too. From Sakura&#39;s teachings and 
the memories I did remember I was pretty much aware that Soul Links 
were eternal. The partners would not necessarily met in every life 
cycle or they wouldn&#39;t even need to be aware of reincarnation. Soul 
mates always attracted each other and if they met, the result was 
almost always predictable.
	Yes, there was no doubt about it anymore that the purple-haired 
girl had belonged, did belong and would belong with us. And the open 
acceptance and longing, that spark of joy I had experienced over the 
link was more than enough proof and encouragement for the other&#39;s 
acceptance of that. Now, all we had to do was survive this battle... I 
glanced back at the fight again where Sakura was trying to nail her 
enemy with spells and cards alike... The creature was either too fast 
or just shrugged them off. It was painfully obvious that neither her 
or Time were left enough time to do any major attacks since the Seeker 
was attacking like a berserker demon if not occupied - and with an 
astonishingly tactical awareness at that!
	&quot;Why don&#39;t you leave her to me?&quot; I jumped slightly and whirled 
on the older woman in the priestess robes kneeling beside us and 
gently checking over Lisa&#39;s form. I had been so caught up in the 
battle that I hadn&#39;t even heard or felt her approach. From the 
background information we had gathered I assumed that had to be Lisa&#39;s 
grandmother. I had been wondering where she was in all that ruckus 
outside and assumed she had to be out or something.
	The older woman chuckled quietly, picking up Lisa with 
surprising ease. &quot;Now, don&#39;t give me that look. You don&#39;t expect an 
old woman to barge in on business that is clearly out of her league, 
do you?&quot; She made a head motion at the distant battle scene. I winced 
and unconsciously took a step forward when I saw Sakura catching a 
blast in the side that sent her flying none too gently. Logical my 
mind knew that Sakura was right and I had nothing to achieve by being 
there but my heart screamed at me to rush to my maid&#39;s aid.
	&quot;Let me take care of Lisa. You see that your friend doesn&#39;t get 
into too much trouble,&quot; Lisa&#39;s assumed grandmother said and went to 
walk off with the younger girl in her arms as if she was weighing 
nothing at all! &quot;Oh, and try to not level the entire Jinja, ne?&quot; She 
winked at me and with that disappeared into the next room, her entire 
demeanor not matching the dangerous situation at all.
	I shook my head at the retreating priestess in amazement but 
then focused back on the scene. It seemed the Seeker had now singled 
out Time and was chasing her around the yard with attacks, leaving 
small craters where the attacks missed her narrowly. Sakura had 
struggled to her feet and tried to use the temporary focus to her 
advantage... only to stagger as the creature whirled around without 
warning, lashing out with a stream of dark energy like a rope coiling 
around her body. At first it was just a flinch but then a short 
high-pitched scream sprang from the redhead&#39;s lips as waves of energy 
shot out over the chain and into her body.
	My heart won the struggle then.
	Darting forward I snatched the staff that Sakura had lost in the 
middle of the action. I had been a little reluctant at first when my 
mate had offered a formal co-bonding to the key years ago, after the 
incident with the Seal Cards. Sakura had said she would feel better 
about it since this kind of magic would be more instinctively and thus 
easier for me to conjure. I wasn&#39;t sure that I was ready at that point 
but events between then and now had taught me to be glad about the 
offer. Especially now.
	&quot;SWORD!&quot;
	The staff responded immediately. I didn&#39;t allow myself to think 
logical, instead letting my instincts take over, hoping that the 
half-awake, half-asleep presence of Amelia would know what to do. 
Apparently she did. &quot;ASTRAL VINE!&quot; There was a brief flare of 
resistance when new magic met old, trying to assimilate into one. My 
concern for Sakura and the resulting will overrode any such barrier 
and the transformed sword-staff was bathed in a deep red glow, filling 
and enhancing it with pure spiritual power from the Astral Plane.
	The Seeker was so distracted with torturing Sakura it never saw 
the strike coming. I was clever enough to call upon the little combat 
training I had had until now and roll away immediately after severing 
the chain and thus managed to avoid an angry swipe with the broken off 
energy chain, the ground shook slightly under the hissing, 
reverberating whip-like snap that followed.
	&quot;BLAST ASH!&quot;
	The creature tried to move but Sakura, teeth pressed together 
against obvious pain, dropped a globe of absolute blackness around it, 
momentarily swallowing the form. With one glance I could tell that she 
had trouble standing upright but was stubbornly refusing to give in. 
Our gazes locked over the brief distance for a moment, concern and 
gratitude equally flashing between us. The battle wasn&#39;t won yet 
though. We both knew that.
	&quot;A circle, now!&quot; Sakura called out urgently.
	For the tiniest of moments I hesitated at the request. On the 
one hand I felt pride swelling up inside of me at the trust but on the 
other I really wasn&#39;t sure if I was ready for that kind of... The 
thought was quickly cut off. By entering this as I had, I was now an 
active part of the battle and could not pull back anymore. Once again 
letting instincts take over I willed the sword to reform into the star 
wand. Standing up I focused on the area where the creature had been 
swallowed by the black hole-like magic. Five cards materialized around 
me as I rooted the wand into the ground, calling up every last bit of 
training and memories I had mastered so far. I could feel the power 
around and inside of me growing in response.
	With a growl the Seeker emerged from Sakura&#39;s spell. I was ready 
for it.
	&quot;FLOW BREAK!&quot;
	The variation of the ancient White Magic spell, now backed by 
the five elemental Clow Cards was probably the strongest I had managed 
so far - apart from the Resurrection back when I had to save Sakura. 
However, for all the effort I could now clearly feel the familiar 
touch of an enormous presence lurking behind the physical body of the 
Seeker, straining against the temporary seal. I dropped to my knees, 
trying to give Sakura that extra bit of time she needed. Time moved 
forward, adding her own powers to the mix but it nearly wasn&#39;t enough. 
Pandora was obviously hell-bent on taking us out right here and now 
with that one minion, feeding it more and more power.
	I glanced back and a mixture of relief and concern washed 
through me as I saw the blade forming between Sakura&#39;s hands. Panting 
in exhaustion I dropped the barrier just in time for the redhead to 
surge forward, the surely lethal spell completed.
	&quot;RAGNA BLADE!&quot;

******************************

(Neptune)
&quot;Okay, who invited this thing?&quot; Uranus hissed in annoyance, temper 
flaring under the heat of battle and the frustration of lacking 
success in it. I could sympathize, really. I saw myself as someone who 
held tight control over her temper, only using it when necessary, but 
even I was getting mildly annoyed at the continuing failure of our 
attacks. I ducked a swipe of one claw, heeding Hotaru&#39;s urgent 
warnings that contact was if somehow possible to be avoided. Once 
again the creature moved insanely fast and only having trained with 
the Senshi of Wind for years, boosting my own speed and agility, 
enabled me to bring my body into a roll, evading the energy beam that 
spiraled onwards to rip a hole into one of the post&#39;s of the Jinja&#39;s 
entrance frame.
	Another arrow flew narrowly over my right shoulder but missed 
its target, the creature having adapted already to those attacks to a 
point where it barely got hit by them anymore. Which was a shame since 
it really didn&#39;t seem to like their purifying nature.
	&#39;Not exactly as I planned our weekend&#39;, I mused. Haruka and I 
had been out enjoying the nice weather and trying to get our mind off 
of the aggravating helplessness that had claimed pretty much all of us 
after Hotaru&#39;s revelations. We had both caught the subtle signs of 
danger immediately, senses still as honed - if not even more - as they 
had been years ago.
	I was glad now we hadn&#39;t slacked in practice and for the 
intensive teamwork training Venus had insisted on after we officially 
joined Inners and Outers into one group. We had been wary, I admit. 
Years of working alone, only Uranus and I, it had been hard. But we 
managed and now it turned out to be a huge benefit because I doubt we 
could have adapted to properly work with the colorful group already 
engaging the Seeker in battle otherwise.
	Uranus joined me a moment later as the green-haired girl took 
our place, wielding her energy blades with skill and ease, yet still 
unable to do proper damage. I watched mesmerized for a moment as she 
phased in and out of view, not with abruptness but with the fluent 
grace of a dancer, just like her attack patterns. Grace being one of 
my own strong points - or so I&#39;ve been told - I could admire this with 
open appreciation. That wasn&#39;t enough though to put the overwhelming 
worry to rest.
	I knew Hotaru and the other two had been here today. Just the 
day before I had spoken to our adoptive daughter and found out what 
they were planning to do, and it was exactly around the time she said 
they&#39;d come by. I hadn&#39;t had time to really concentrate on that but 
now I could tell that they were neither here, nor anywhere in the 
Jinja&#39;s near perimeter. I was pretty sure I would know if they were 
nearby.
	&quot;Where are Hotaru and the others?&quot; I asked Mars after joining my 
partner in a double attack, distracting the creature long enough to 
give the other, now slightly winded girl an opportunity to get out of 
immediate reach. This swap routine was getting tiring. I was pretty 
sure we were wearing it down but the question was how fast? And would 
it be fast enough?
	&quot;Safe,&quot; Mars replied curtly, her eyes flashing with her own 
worry. Over the years she had managed to sharpen her temper to suit 
her needs, to focus better on her abilities. I would readily agree 
that she had outdone me long ago in pure spiritual skill. The worry I 
saw there now fueling her concentration was more related to the 
situation at hand and not at my question, or at least that&#39;s what I 
thought, maybe what I wanted to think. She shot another fireball from 
her fingertips, spreading the flames into a tight circle, momentarily 
boxing in the enemy. &quot;It&#39;s energy levels are dropping,&quot; Mars mumbled 
quietly, then corrected herself. &quot;No, that&#39;s not right. It had been 
fueled by an outside source before and that is dropping...&quot; She 
shivered. &quot;Or diverting attention elsewhere.&quot;
	Deciding to let it go for the moment, trusting that Mars knew 
what she was talking about I glanced over at Uranus. A brief eye 
contact was everything it took and the move was executed. Harmony born 
from years of companionship allowed us to set up an attack that 
managed to blindside the creature. Drawing its attention I played bait 
and readily accepted a minor hit. That stung, though not as much as 
the slice from the Space Sword when Uranus cut deeply into the 
Seeker&#39;s side, swiftly moving away again. The monstrous beast howled 
in obvious pain but once again showed remarkable endurance as it went 
right onto the offense. I hadn&#39;t quite recovered from the hit I had 
taken and was presenting a much too easy target...
	&quot;CHRONOS TYPHOON,&quot; a whisper rang out over the yard deep and 
clear. A temporal gale storm suddenly encased our enemy flinging it 
off the ground and quite a distance away. A moment later a shadow fell 
over where I was still kneeling. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; Pluto asked, 
giving the wound a concerned glance.
	&quot;Only superficial,&quot; I muttered. &quot;Is anyone else going to come? I 
hate to admit it but we are having huge problems here.&quot; Uranus, who 
had moved over to join us, nodded in grim agreement, eying the 
creature that was getting to its feet again, even more angry than 
before.
	&quot;Usagi&#39;s on her way,&quot; Pluto confirmed, twirling her staff and 
pointing it back at the proper target. &quot;DEAD SCREAM.&quot;
	There was a time, right at the beginning, when we had met in the 
midst of the Death Busters crisis that the statement would have 
resulted in mixed feelings, now I couldn&#39;t deny the relief and the 
spark of hope those few words had ignited. Judging by the slight shift 
in position that I doubt anyone else caught, Uranus felt the same.
	&quot;I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s giving us time to wait,&quot; one of Mars&#39; friends 
commented, the one who had her hair tied into a ponytail and was 
sporting an impossible huge boomerang - wielding it with equally 
impossible ease.
	The head miko was already a step ahead of her as it seemed. 
&quot;Kagome, Hitomi spread out, the others distract it for awhile and keep 
it as much in one place as possible.&quot; Not waiting for confirmation 
she, the girl with the light-brown hair and the other black-haired one 
spread out to circle around the Seeker. I wouldn&#39;t have questioned 
anyway, any suggestion that came over with that much confidence was 
surely welcome. The trouble was the other part of the plan which 
involved distracting the enemy that proved very agile and resistant, 
having proven to adept fast to any new tactic or patterns and never 
giving us much time to set up something complex.
	&quot;I know this sounds silly, but if no one has a better idea, I 
suggest just keeping it busy is our best option,&quot; the one with the 
energy blades stated, already moving to resume the attack.
	I glanced at Uranus and then briefly at Pluto. Receiving a shrug 
from the former and a stoic nod from the latter, we moved as one, 
Uranus and I taking point on either side while Pluto circled around to 
the back, leaving the front open for the remaining two girls. Frankly 
I wasn&#39;t sure if that was the best idea to leave the frontal assault 
to the other unfamiliar girls who despite obvious skill definitely 
didn&#39;t have our Senshi advantages, the formation had come natural 
though and years of honing tactics as well as instincts told me to 
just go with the flow. It wasn&#39;t like the positions were going to 
remain fixed anyway.
	The following minutes were leaving not much room for conscious 
room and I had to rely on my battle instincts alone. Distantly I noted 
that if THIS was just a minion - albeit a formidable one - then we 
would have a lot of work to do in order to survive against this 
threat. I filed this away for later use and continued to focus on 
staying alive right now and keeping the creature as occupied as 
possible. It was a small miracle that our mixed attack force of two 
groups not used to each other managed to harmonize for the few minutes 
the brief but heated skirmish took.
	Finally a glance over my shoulder in a temporary moment of being 
able to take a steady breath told me that Mars and her two friends had 
obviously finished whatever they were doing. As I mentioned earlier, I 
wasn&#39;t a spiritualist or trained in any kind of religion but I had 
always been rather sensitive. And those senses were taking in the 
perfectly aligned triangle formed by the three women.
	&quot;Break!&quot; I called and everyone was more than willing to heed the 
advice, being very much in need of one.
	No sooner had we cleared the space between the three woman and 
our enemy as I took note of lines of spiritual power forming between 
them. The Seeker had been ready to move afterwards but now flinched 
and then put up a valiant struggle which availed it nothing though. I 
took a glance at Mars and the other two and noted that they didn&#39;t 
look like they could keep this up for very long.
	That was when - and I mean that quite literally and without 
being poetic or something - our Angel of Hope arrived and the rest 
was, thankfully, the result that should be expected.

******************************

()
If someone had come by the Jinseikouro shrine right now they would 
have started slack jawed at the mass destruction. No, the building was 
still standing and remarkably enough looked pretty much untouched. The 
yard through was a plane of burned stone, small and bigger craters, 
rubble flung into every direction. It looked worse than it actual was 
but the casual onlooker probably would have a hard time believing. 
That is if they even had time to think before taking in the scene in 
the center of the yard where a monstrosity with black skin was just 
impaled by an equally black but strangely formless, non-corporal 
blade.
	The wielder, a older teenager with brownish-red hair shook 
visibly under some kind of strain, twisting the blade slightly before 
with a flick of her hand it neatly cut through skin, leaving the 
beast&#39;s form broken and dead. Or so everyone had thought. Including 
Sakura and Tomoyo. The dark-haired girl realized with a start though 
that the creature was somehow still moving even as the energy blade 
dissipated from obvious strain and exhaustion. For a moment terror 
gripped her heart as the creature, on the verge of death, moved 
forward towards her beloved. She was too far away, she could do 
nothing to prevent the last act of defiance from their foe...
	Suddenly the distorted form of the Seeker let out a gurgling 
noise before exploding into many thousands of particles, revealing a 
man clad like a priest with a staff in both hands which he now drew 
back to rest in one at his sight. The enigmatic smile had never left 
his face. &quot;Stubborn bastard,&quot; he commented casually.
	Tomoyo needn&#39;t even access her memories of Amelia to recognize 
him and only had it confirmed by the mixture of annoyance and anger 
the hiss from Sakura conveyed while she dragged herself over to the 
duo.
	&quot;You.&quot; After taking a ragged breath, she added, &quot;I should have 
known you were still around. Just to annoy Filia.&quot; The strained smile 
was humorless. Tomoyo could tell the redhead was struggling with both 
relief and annoyance. &quot;How long have you been here?&quot; the question 
finally came, more like a snarl.
	Xelloss, self-proclaimed Mysterious Priest, didn&#39;t even flinch 
under the accusing stare. &quot;Long enough,&quot; he said calmly, holding up a 
hand. &quot;You can beat me up later though I can assure you I have 
legitimate reasons for not interfering earlier. I think now you should 
rest. You drained a lot of your reserves.&quot; He stopped to fix Sakura 
with a brief but uncharacteristically hard stare - well, for dealing 
with them or their former lives at that anyway. &quot;If it is of any 
assurance to you. I PROMISE you that no one came to harm in either of 
today&#39;s attacks.&quot;
	Both girls knew that serious promises like this were something 
the man gave scarcely and thus could be assumed to be truthful, as 
truthful as you get with his kind.
	&quot;Either?&quot; Tomoyo asked what was on Sakura&#39;s mind as well.
	&quot;Oops,&quot; Xelloss smiled, as he always did. &quot;Did I say that?&quot; He 
shrugged. &quot;Oh well, you realize that those things always come in 
pairs, don&#39;t you?&quot; Once again Sakura cursed and then her body shook 
slightly as the effects of the spell overtook her, the reincarnated 
form still unused to channel such high quality Chaos Magic.
	Xelloss looked actually worried for a moment, before focusing on 
Tomoyo with once again unusual seriousness. &quot;Get her back inside and 
take care of that. I&#39;ll stop by later.&quot; And with that he vanished from 
sight, just to reappear in the big tree that had only received some 
minor damage from the battle. He watched as the dark-haired girl 
struggled to help her companion inside.
	&quot;So much for that.&quot; Both young women would have been surprised 
to actually hear the Mazoku sigh. &quot;I think I&#39;m getting too old for 
this.&quot; Closing his eyes briefly he took a death breath... well, he 
would have if his form allowed him that action. Then the smile was 
back in place and with almost casual indifference he said, &quot;Alright, 
next business,&quot; and vanished from sight completely.

******************************

(Sasami)
{A/N: From now on when I refer to Sasami/Tsunami I will only use 
Sasami since she provides the physical body. When I do flashbacks or 
similar things I might go and use the appropriate name then.}
I glanced up from my position, seated and leaning against the trunk of 
my tree self, here in the heart of the ship, when I sensed the 
familiar presence approach. It felt definitely weird. Not really odd 
or uncomfortable, I hadn&#39;t even been afraid of this anymore. Sasami 
and Tsunami had been connected for so long that over the years a much 
deeper understanding for each other had developed and recently they 
had been so close already that the finality of today was just a 
logical conclusion, a technical detail that had needed to be done.
	The only thing that was really weird was that the constant 
background presence was gone, merged completely with my own. It had 
been that way for both aspects, and the lack of that comforting 
presence left a void in its place, a void which was quickly filled by 
the new harmony my soul inspired, the balance longed for finally 
completed.
	I suppose that&#39;s one the things the others back on Jurai never 
understood. Oh, they said they did, they tried to be understanding, 
but real comprehension? No. In the back of their minds they were 
thinking of assimilation as one aspect dominating the others. In my 
case though, it was more like the scattered pieces of a soul merged 
together that had been meant to be one from the start. That happened 
sometimes in the great scheme of things. Sometimes fragments of a soul 
that was supposed to be one were born in different ages and would 
somehow seek out each other over time. It had been that way for 
Tsunami and the tree, it had been that way for Tsunami and Sasami.
	The part of me that was Sasami though brought one of the most 
valuable gifts back into the mix other than a truly physical body. 
Innocence. No, not naivety, that&#39;s a completely different thing. I 
meant the kind of innocent purity that had been lost to both other 
aspects of myself through personal and universal hardship. Sasami, 
despite all that she had seen, had always managed to keep some level 
of innocence and purity.
	In essence I felt complete, more so than I could ever remember 
from either set of memory. There was just one last thing missing.
	As my eyes met deep purple ones I slowly pushed up to stand, 
still remaining contact with my tree self. A deafening silence 
vibrated in the space between us, our gazes locked and neither moving, 
emotions flashing through worried eyes.
	It had been one of the hardest decision, personally, that I&#39;ve 
ever made, leaving the rest of my friends behind to take care of the 
delivery. Of course, I knew long before that there was no other way. 
Had I done anything different, acted on my selfish impulses, the 
downward spiral into disaster would have begun today and the war would 
have been lost before it even had really begun. No, what I did was the 
right thing and I had had all the confidence in the world in the 
black-haired miko and the rest of the girls who had come to be such 
good friends and comrades in barely two years time. Yet, I was 
immensely relieved to see Mars unhurt, especially after not having 
been able to divide even a shred of concentration towards the 
activities below. The proceedings up here had been straining and 
exhausting enough to call for my full attention. All of me.
	Finally the Senshi of Fire stepped forward, reaching out with 
one hand to touch my cheek, not flinching as my eyes showed the sliver 
of doubt and fear in them. We had talked about this, of course, and I 
honestly believed that the other woman understood, that she really 
understood what that which had happened today meant to me. Still, I 
could not help but fear rejection. I had already lost love once 
because of this. No, that wasn&#39;t fair. It hadn&#39;t been entirely because 
of the assimilation. There had been a lot going on. This here, this 
was important though, maybe even more so than Tenchi had ever been. 
Don&#39;t ask me how after such a short time you could fall so much in 
love with someone. Frankly this had been the last thing I had planned 
to find when I had set out years ago.
	&quot;This doesn&#39;t change anything,&quot; the raven-haired female warrior 
said with utmost conviction and I felt my heart make a leap at the 
gentle, loving gaze directed at me. She really did understand. She 
understood that the emotional bindings of one part that I now defined 
as myself were the bindings of all, meaning the love that I felt for 
her came from my whole being. She had been the first to really, truly 
understand - apart from Washu maybe - and the gratitude and 
overwhelming affection I felt because of this was nearly choking me.
	&quot;I love you,&quot; I whispered, before bringing my hands up around 
her neck to bring her down into a brief kiss, passionate and full of 
need, expressing all the worry that had been in the back of my mind 
during the recent events. My lips lingered on hers for a moment before 
pulling back slightly, not relaxing my grip though or letting go in 
any other way. Mars didn&#39;t seem to mind.
	&quot;I&#39;m alright, really,&quot; she said, interpreting my feelings 
correctly. &quot;We are all a little winded, some scratches, but no one got 
hurt. Thanks to Usagi, that is.&quot; She looked at me seriously, her eyes 
inquiring without judgment. &quot;She said someone or something was calling 
her... Did you?&quot;
	I nodded, relief again flooding through me. I hadn&#39;t had time to 
check whether or not the mental call I had sent out had been received 
properly. I didn&#39;t have a connection to her as I had to Serenity and 
most of my focus had been on Peitho at that moment. Leaving my 
girlfriend and the others behind unguarded though hadn&#39;t been an 
option either. I knew how Pandora&#39;s creatures reacted to the output 
from Serenity&#39;s Ginzishou and from what I had gathered the 
reincarnation of this generation had a much more active and developed 
bond to her crystal than even Serenity had at the beginning of the 
Creation War. Obviously I had been correct.
	&quot;How is Minako and...&quot; Mars&#39; voice trailed off as it was her 
turn to be concerned.
	I quickly shushed her with a chaste kiss. &quot;Everything is fine. 
There will be some ramifications but nothing to be really worried 
about,&quot; I explained with the same assurance that the other woman had 
used earlier and in a softer tone added, &quot;Nothing and nobody was lost 
today.&quot;
	For a moment neither of us said anything, basking in each 
other&#39;s presence. A soft breeze played with our hair, treetops swayed 
gently all around us and the clear life water of the pond sent ripples 
out from our position. I was infinitely grateful for the moment of 
calm after all the events. As I said, no loss had been suffered. I 
didn&#39;t know whether or not I would have been able to deal with the 
guilt and shame had I not succeeded in my task or something more fatal 
had happened in the battle.
	Precognitive abilities could be both a blessing and a burden and 
I hated making decision that might hurt others, knowing that any other 
course of action would result into a much bigger catastrophe. I was by 
far not omnipotent but the ancient knowledge and abilities of a tree 
spirit were vast and really hard to explain. They had often enough 
brought part of me much loneliness and alienation.
	Not anymore though.
	&quot;Are you ready?&quot; I asked in a hushed, somber voice, almost not 
daring to break the spell of the subspace scenery and the bubble of 
harmony around us, but knowing that time was running out for the last 
optional part of the assimilation process. A part that didn&#39;t need to 
be done but that I wished, longed and hoped for. &quot;I don&#39;t want you 
to...&quot;
	My words were cut of by another kiss and I could feel her 
spirit... no, her very soul reaching out to touch mine, gently moving 
in to mingle with all the aspects already there, filling the space 
that had still been vacant. &quot;I am ready.&quot;
	No further words were needed.

******************************

(Hotaru)
A low groan rumbled forth from my throat and I reached up with one 
hand to rub my forehead. Slowly I blinked my eyes open against the 
hazy effect. The room I was in was small but definitely cozy, a warm 
feeling of safety. Despite that there was nothing special. Bluish, 
almost watery walls, Spartan furniture and two other beds beside the 
one I was currently lying on.
	Carefully I set up, fighting the sensation of dizziness that the 
drain of too much internal mana had left. The energy was slowly 
refilling itself but it would take some time to compensate for the 
vast loss. &#39;Probably even more so for them&#39;, I thought, taking a 
couple of steps so that I stood between the other two beds. With one 
hand I reached out to first stroke softly through golden bangs and 
then on the other side along the edge of brown hair. A gentle smile 
tugged at the corner of my lips taking in the sight of the peacefully 
resting forms of my family.
	&#39;Family?&#39; I blinked for a moment, wondering for a moment where 
that had come from, but then the answer came naturally. I just had to 
close my eyes and reach inside of me, feeling the bond there that tied 
us all together. All three... no, all four of us. Another smile as a 
huge ton of anxiousness I hadn&#39;t even realized was there yet fell from 
shoulders.
	Deciding that the two woman would probably need some time to 
recover their senses, I made my way over to the door which slid open 
soundlessly to reveal a small hallway. I stepped outside, looking 
around. My senses, even as dilated as they were at the moment, pretty 
much told me already where we were. I hadn&#39;t had time to properly 
focus but now I could see beyond the subspace field inside what I 
suspected to be a vast space vessel of some sort. Tree branches lined 
the walls and there was some kind of porthole at the end of the 
hallway. Moving over to the hole I didn&#39;t hesitate to step in, feeling 
the dimensional warp ahead and merely looked around to re-orientate 
myself. I was back in the forest setting, most likely the core of the 
ship, especially considering the massive tree dominating the scenery 
from its central position.
	I spotted her sitting against the base of the trunk, with her 
hair open and two circular markings on her forehead, as well as the 
crescent moon albeit being hidden at the moment in between them. With 
a raised eyebrow I took note of the fact that Rei was there as well, 
pretty much all but resting with her head in the other girl&#39;s lap, a 
thick blanket of foliage covering them both to a degree.
	&quot;Am I coming at a bad time?&quot; I questioned with a slight smirk as 
I held Tsunami&#39;s eyes while approaching the two. I couldn&#39;t help the 
wink, feeling much too happy and content at the moment now that the 
crisis was temporally averted and everyone was apparently safe. Rei&#39;s 
presence confirmed that. That and a lot more.
	Tsunami shook her head softly and gently repositioned the 
raven-haired priestess against the tree, rising in the process, more 
appropriate clothes shimmering into existence. I smiled at the slight 
blush Tsunami was trying to hide but failing miserably to do so. She 
had always been a bit reclusive and... shy when it came to her 
personal feelings. &quot;The bond had to be done now or we would have had 
to wait a long time,&quot; the blue-haired girl said. Her outward 
appearance was a little older than Sasami had been... then again, I 
never could quite determine Sasami&#39;s age before.
	&quot;Are you happy?&quot; I heard myself ask even though there was so 
much else I wanted to know. The atmosphere between us wasn&#39;t even 
uncomfortable, more a little... awkward. It had been over two hundred 
millennia after all that we&#39;ve spoken to each other, as... adopted 
daughter and mother that is.
	&quot;I am,&quot; Tsunami softly replied. She took a step forward and then 
after a slight pause, crossed the remaining distance. I received her 
in my arms with natural ease, falling into the old memories and 
basking in their revival. Until this moment I hadn&#39;t realized just how 
much I had missed her, the feelings clouded by the loss of Peitho, 
overshadowed by the loneliness created from my mate&#39;s absence. Now 
that was mostly out of the way, moved aside for other things to 
remember, to long for.
	&quot;I missed you,&quot; the young woman in my arms said after a while of 
comfortable silence. She looked up to meet my gaze and my heart 
reached out to her in this instant, the feelings I saw there hard if 
not impossible to properly describe. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have left, I know 
that now.&quot; Her voice was small, that of a little child&#39;s, not that of 
the young, strong woman she had been hours ago in the midst of chaos.
	&quot;You&#39;ve grown up,&quot; I simply said, saying with my eyes what 
needn&#39;t be said with words. Tsunami&#39;s expression softened with relief. 
&quot;Several times now, I suppose,&quot; I added with a grin, glancing up at 
the tree. &quot;But really now. A Yggdrasil? When you left to make your own 
mark on the world I had no doubt you would but... Isn&#39;t this a 
little...&quot;
	&quot;Much?&quot; the other girl answered with a wink of her own before 
pulling away. She walked back to the tree and gently traced her hand 
over the bark. &quot;She needed my help when I found her. Serenity would 
have done the same I&#39;m sure.&quot;
	I nodded with a smile. &quot;See. No need to worry then. We were all 
young and had to cope with being put through too much to even 
comprehend for living beings, even those like us. You found your path, 
didn&#39;t you?&quot; I said, trying to show the pride I was feeling. There was 
still much I&#39;d like to know, what happened to the woman I had 
cherished like a daughter for nearly two decades, but that could wait 
until later.
	&quot;I did. And I learned my lesson.&quot; There was a deep sadness and 
concern there, something I could relate to on a basic level, having 
seen generations come and go, having watched the Silver Millennium 
slowly fall prey to the cancer from within. Metallia and Beryl had 
just finished what had been predictable for many years before their 
time. I saw the same realization in the pink eyes of the other woman 
even if for other scenarios yet unknown to me.
	&quot;But you are staying now, aren&#39;t you?&quot; I asked, curious but 
sensing the topic too depressing for either of our current moods. 
There would be time later.
	I followed her meaningful gaze to Rei&#39;s sleeping form. Outwardly 
nothing much seemed different but where before a strong bond had 
already existed between them, it was now just as potent and final as 
that between Makoto, Minako and myself. &quot;I have a reason to. Many 
reasons actually. I still have obligations elsewhere but... This is my 
home, it has been and is again. And maybe together we can learn from 
the mistakes we made and build something... better.&quot; She turned back 
to me, expression still soft but more serious. &quot;But that isn&#39;t what 
you really want to know right now, isn&#39;t it?&quot;
	I shook my head, surely looking slightly sheepish. &quot;Not really. 
I can feel her though, that&#39;s why I wasn&#39;t too worried.&quot; After a 
moment&#39;s pause I added, &quot;So where have you tugged away your new 
sister?&quot;
	A short feeling of... dread shot through me at the pensive look 
in Tsunami&#39;s eyes. Then she held up a hand and with a wave the space 
shifted to show a watery pool filled with some sort of light green 
liquid shimmering in the air. Like a tiny star in the middle of space 
a small crystal floated in its center, shimmering in rainbow colors 
that looked a little faded, like a fine sheen was covering the 
crystal, dimming the richness of what surely had to be a fascinating 
spectacle otherwise. The trained eye could see the translucent bird 
wings that would give the crystal its unique form when properly 
matured. A sigh of relief left my lips, as the rest of the anxiousness 
left me.
	&quot;This was all I could do. The seed was immature and will need 
some time to form a physical body. I...&quot; Tsunami stopped, voice 
wavering. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;
	Moving forwards I stepped through the water and drew the other 
woman against me, trying to quell her guilt. &quot;And without you here, as 
you are now, what you have become, do you think the seed would have 
survived?&quot; I asked gently, pushing her away at arm&#39;s length to fix her 
with the best stern face I could manage. Probably nowhere near what 
Haruka could do at her best but hey, it had always worked before. &quot;So 
don&#39;t you dare beat yourself up over this. You did well and everyone&#39;s 
fine.&quot; I gave a glance in Rei&#39;s direction, making sure that the 
blue-haired woman noticed it. &quot;You should be happy.&quot;
	For a moment longer we remained as we were but then Tsunami fell 
back into the embrace. &quot;I missed you, Phoebe,&quot; she repeated softly.
	&quot;I missed you, too, Tsunami-chan.&quot;

(Lisa)
Methodically I changed the wet cloth. This had been an admittedly 
soothing routine at first but soon became less and less distracting, 
as I found my mind wander over the events of a couple of hours ago... 
or more like the events that I had barely even been a conscious part 
of. In the heat of the moment, when I had no other choice to adept it 
was easy to meld present and past memories. Now, I began to experience 
the thorough... disorientation.
	And yet, despite the oddity and at the same time seriousness of 
the situation, an inner peace had settled in my soul, filling that 
which I had searched years for, the missing part I had always 
recognized as lacking. I had found it... although the price was quite 
a high one. I tried to reason that most likely regardless of what I 
could have done, this would have happened sooner or later. However, I 
couldn&#39;t help the nagging self-loathing directed at myself. If I had 
just insisted on them coming over earlier, maybe all of this could 
have been avoided. Now the consequences were once again...
	I closed my eyes but there was no escaping the scene as similar 
images of the past haunted me. Of the same redhead, different but yet 
so similar in nature, in a state no human soul should experience, 
especially beginning at such a tender age. It was the same thing all 
over again and it didn&#39;t help anything that I wasn&#39;t really 
responsible. I felt responsible. Responsible for the condition, 
responsible for her.
	A slight creak - which probably no one who hadn&#39;t spent as much 
time as I did here would have noticed - announced the opening of the 
door a moment before it actually happened. That gave me enough time to 
notice that my fingers had absently began to play with auburn-red 
hair. I jerked them away a pang of guilt lancing through me as I saw 
Amelia... Tomoyo - I reminded myself that she didn&#39;t have a complete 
memory set for some weird reason yet - slip into the room. The 
reaction was probably unnecessary since we were... had been... would 
be... Gah, it&#39;s not easy sorting through all the different feedback 
your brain gives you with memories and a personality of two different 
lives. It would be easier over time, Sakura seemed to do fine from 
what I had seen and could now interpret. So soon after the reawakening 
of my past&#39;s memories, however, it was a great deal confusing.
	&quot;Your grandmother is a nice woman,&quot; Tomoyo commented, not giving 
any indication that she took note of my hasty action or if, she didn&#39;t 
seem to mind. I was secretly hoping for the second. I was pretty sure 
it was the second. One connection I could make now is that compared to 
Amelia, the girl now sitting down on the other chair next to the bed 
after having put down the small tray was far more perspective. Not 
that Amelia hadn&#39;t been, but a similar trait of character analyzes 
only surfaced when she had been a lot older, forced to take over the 
mantle of Queen at a young age. For Tomoyo it seemed to be a natural 
thing that probably had been there for all of her life.
	I smiled at the comment, reminded once again of how... accepting 
Baasan was. She took everything in stride and rarely acted surprised 
by something, not to mention that she had maintained an amazing 
vitality for her age. &quot;Yes, she is.&quot; I glanced at the dresser and the 
framed photograph there. &quot;I am glad I can be here with her. She taught 
me a great deal.&quot;
	Tomoyo seemed to have caught the look but didn&#39;t make a comment. 
I found myself amazed once again at the lack of tension I registered 
from the other girl. Granted she probably was prepared for this, had a 
lot of time preparing for the possibility of... this. But Tomoyo 
wasn&#39;t quite Amelia, her memories were fragmented and the part of her 
soul that carried the Queen of Saillune was somewhere caught between 
sleep and wakefulness. On top of that it was apparent that she and 
Sakura went along the way in this life whereas I might seem like... an 
intruder. I felt like one on some level. That&#39;s why I felt slightly 
awkward.
	&quot;How is she?&quot; Tomoyo asked after a short while, our gazes 
mutually focused on the resting form of the redhead. The question 
didn&#39;t help the awkwardness because the answer would most likely lead 
to the inevitable.
	&quot;Erratic,&quot; I replied simply, not looking up to meet the other 
girl&#39;s eyes. I could feel the inquiring stare and added, &quot;You know 
what I mean.&quot;
	Silence hang over the room as the full impact of the situation 
settled in. I heard Tomoyo drawing in a sharp breath before releasing 
it slowly. &quot;She was afraid that would happen. Her mana is more 
balanced in this life but not used to channel something so potent yet. 
The only time she did that before was more or less lethal.&quot; My head 
snapped around at the sad tone and the implications the revelations 
bound to it. Seeing the pained expression though I decided that 
explaining what she meant with this could wait until later. It wasn&#39;t 
all that important to the current situation anyway.
	I blinked as a soft chuckle escaped Tomoyo&#39;s lips. &quot;Must be 
fate. It has been the same thing for us in our last life, has it not? 
The beginning, I mean.&quot; I grimaced at the truth of her statement. The 
initial forming of our bond had been in a similar, even if not so dire 
situation. The parallels were hard to ignore. It seemed fate liked to 
throw us at each other by force. I couldn&#39;t help but laugh. It was 
neither really humorous nor overly bitter. However, it helped me to 
relax slightly.
	Seconds stretched into a minute, maybe two as we sat there, 
staring at each other. Well, staring would be too strong a word. It 
was more like shyly searching eye contact once in awhile, almost 
expecting the other to give some negative sign or reaction. Nothing 
like that happened though. The bond held true and all I saw was 
reserved but present affection, underlined by something deeper and 
older. I felt myself drawn into blue eyes magnetically, unable to 
resist the spell, not WANTING to resist.
	&quot;We don&#39;t need too... you know, now...&quot; I started even though my 
heart wasn&#39;t really in the offer and quite frankly I didn&#39;t think it 
was even possible to avoid physically acknowledging the bond. I 
couldn&#39;t help but feel that this was all rather rushed and neither of 
us was given much of a chance to adjust.
	I was so unprepared when the other girl suddenly leaned forward, 
bringing our faces so close together that I could feel her soft breath 
that I almost fell from my chair. The pull that had been vibrant 
before was now like the beat of a sledgehammer. Powerful, fast and 
unable to ignore. No words were really needed and they weren&#39;t spoken 
either. I leaned into the touch of one tentative palm on my cheek, 
refraining to close my eyes, unable to break contact with the striking 
beautiful orbs so full of warmth and acceptance, of understanding. 
Yes, she understood, even lacking the advantage of full memories she 
did understand what the bond between us meant.
	It was so much like the vivid images in my memories. The first 
sparks of love that had quickly matured after that between Amelia and 
Sylphiel. The situation was almost a mirror of that time. The feelings 
of kinship just as strong as then, maybe even more so now with the 
added memories. In a bold move I reached with one hand behind the 
dark-haired girl&#39;s head, drawing her in for a kiss that was, in the 
literal sense, the meeting of two souls who had sought each other for 
a long time, always close but never allowed to touch as they had 
longed to. You could almost hear the ethereal sigh of contentment and 
relief. Oh, it wasn&#39;t a passionate kiss, more soft and slow, not 
awkward either but with a harmony that spoke of that which existed 
between us even though neither of us had really understood or even 
known that for a long time.
	The contact was rather brief, yet left me with an even greater 
sense of fulfillment, a completeness previously unknown to me. There 
was only one thing missing now to reseal the ancient connection 
between us.
	A shy but truly radiant smile answered my own grin as we parted, 
I untangled my fingers from their place in the dark hair, taking the 
hand on my cheek and interlocking our fingers gently. I glanced up to 
see Tomoyo&#39;s expression hadn&#39;t changed. Totally devoid of any doubt or 
hesitation, willing and wanting to experience the full extent of that 
which had been lost so long ago and that had been taken from us so 
forcefully.
	I glanced back at Sakura&#39;s form as I noticed her stirring 
slightly. The recovery spell had almost completed its work now. All 
that needed to be done now was stabilizing the mana disorder the use 
of the Ragna Blade had once again created. And there was only one 
permanent way to do so.
	&quot;Ready?&quot; I asked in a whisper, not needing to look. The squeeze 
from our joined hands was answer enough. I couldn&#39;t help but grin 
slightly. Sakura was in for one hell of a wakeup call. I swore I heard 
Soyo-chan chuckle at the mental picture.

******************************

(Sakura)
There is something you cannot quite describe about the sensation 
waking up snuggled comfortably between the warm bodies of two 
incredible women. As hard as you might try to say with words what went 
on inside of you, words were rather inadequate for this kind of 
situation. There had been a brief moment of... panic when I woke up, 
my sleep-clouded mind not yet able to properly process what the rest 
of my senses were relaying. A dozen scenarios had flashed before my 
mental eyes but ultimately the fog had cleared and the memories of 
last night came back, coaxing a soft smile on my lips. Had it even 
been night? What time was it anyway? Somewhere around mid or late 
morning I suspected. I hadn&#39;t paid attention before falling asleep 
again exhausted, the kind of exhausted that had nothing to do with 
intensive fighting...
	I&#39;m sure the silly grin threatened to split my face as I turned 
back to gaze at the magnificent sight of Tomoyo on my right and Lisa 
on my left, both having their heads resting on my chest, just above 
either breast like a cushion, sleeping the sleep of the innocent. 
&#39;Yeah right, innocent! I suppose the saying is true after all. It is 
always the quiet ones you have to look out for.&#39;
	The last thing I remembered before being woken up in a rather... 
unexpected manner was slaying the Seeker with the Ragna Blade. I had 
nearly lost consciousness before finishing the incantation and pure 
will alone had pushed me onwards, knowing that if I failed to take out 
the enemy we would all be finished. The strain was enormous. On top of 
the fact that this body still had a hard time adapting to the strong 
essence of Chaos Magic, the shocks of dark energy Pandora&#39;s creature 
had given me had done their own bit to bring me to the edge of 
unconsciousness. Somehow I had still pulled through, aware that I 
pretty much overexerted my mana in the process.
	Therefore I logically shouldn&#39;t have been surprised at the 
consequential scenario that followed. Screw logic. Waking up after 
such a straining battle to the sight of two beautiful young women with 
rather clear and willing intentions should break even the most 
strong-willed composure. In the state I was in, I had not much to 
object. I could feel the signs of mana overload, being all too 
familiar with it and my soul and spirit practically cried out for the 
salvation promised by the two others who had given it in such a 
fulfilling, completing manner so long ago.
	Now, looking back at it I couldn&#39;t help the fleeting thought if 
all this might have been too fast. The ironic parallel to that night 
in Saillune that had been the beginning of our relationship back then 
was all too present in my mind. Then again, those doubts pretty much 
paled in comparison to the feedback from the bond during its physical 
re-acknowledgment. The harmony was overwhelming, touching right down 
to the core with the trust and acceptance I could make out from the 
other two.
	Especially Tomoyo. I had gotten the first glimpses of just how 
important this was to her before, but during the lovemaking I could 
see that she comprehended on an almost conscious level the 
significance of that which was between us, even without her full 
memories of Amelia.
	&quot;Feeling better?&quot; I barely resisted the urge to jump, an 
unconscious part of my mind rationalizing that I didn&#39;t want to 
disturb the two other girl&#39;s sleep for now. I fought down the initial 
reaction and turned my head slightly to the left where seemingly 
without concern for our quite naked states the small form of Lisa&#39;s 
Wind Elemental was perched on her mistress&#39; shoulder. A slight blush 
crept into my face but I ignored the urge to reach for the covers. 
From my studies I knew that natural Elementals had low to no regard at 
all for concepts of modesty and the stare the golden-haired Sylph was 
directing my way was rather distracting, in a somewhat uncomfortable 
manner.
	&quot;I do,&quot; I replied after realizing the spiritual being was 
waiting for an answer. &quot;Um, I don&#39;t think we have been properly 
introduced, I am...&quot;
	&quot;I know who you are. The backlash from the memories was hard to 
ignore.&quot; She glance at Lisa for a moment and while I wasn&#39;t the best 
person ever to read over people&#39;s emotion, I thought I saw something 
akin to... longing there. I blinked, distracted from the startling 
thought when the Sylph looked back up. &quot;Lisa calls me Soyo-chan. You 
can do so too, but only under one condition.&quot; She didn&#39;t even give me 
a time to nod before continuing in a gravely serious tone. &quot;If you 
hurt her, you will regret it. Powerful sorceress or not.&quot;
	I held the daring gaze of tiny sky-blue eyes for a long moment, 
seeing the depth of affection. I wasn&#39;t quite sure how deep it reached 
but it was apparent that it went deeper than just close friendship. &quot;I 
have no intention to,&quot; I said seriously with all the honesty I could 
manage. The decision had been made anyway. After last night - or 
whenever it was - turning back was hardly an option. Not that the 
option would ever cross my mind. If Tomoyo and Lisa were alright with 
this, I would certainly not object. My heart was just too happy at the 
prospect of the second chance given to us.
	&quot;Good.&quot; Soyo-chan nodded seriously. &quot;Take good care of her.&quot; 
With a flash she disappeared. I glanced down at the ring on Lisa&#39;s 
finger. I remembered reading about contract rings. They were said to 
be ancient tools made by dwarves to form a bond, a contract between a 
suitable candidate and an elemental spirit. I was really interested in 
where exactly the other girl had picked it up in this time and age.
	A slight shift indicated that one of the two girls was 
stirring... no, that wasn&#39;t quite right. They were both stirring and 
my mind boggled slightly at the synchrony with which Tomoyo and Lisa 
blinked open their eyes and lifted their heads slightly to meet my own 
gaze. I couldn&#39;t help but smile at the cute and sexy sight.
	&quot;You two seem rather satisfied with yourselves,&quot; I commented 
dryly but inwardly chuckled at the slightly confused expressions of 
just having woken up on the other two&#39;s faces. Deciding that a little 
payback was in order, I reached down to firmly pull the purple-haired 
miko up so that our faces were on the same level. Gazing into green 
eyes for a moment I relished in the mixture of familiar feelings and a 
refreshing newness. Lisa blinked cutely, still kind of half-asleep but 
that was probably quickly changed when I pulled her in for a soft, 
slow kiss. The sparkle in the other girl&#39;s eyes upon departure was 
more than enough reward.
	Focusing on Tomoyo who had sat up in the meantime, I gave her no 
time to contemplate, repeating the same procedure as with Lisa, 
feeling the overwhelming need to reassure her and myself that nothing 
would change between us. And nothing had. I felt that upon first 
contact. The last bit of doubt was shredded into so many tiny pieces. 
The small part of our relationship that had been vacant until now had 
been filled and the consequences weren&#39;t minimizing what was between 
us. That Lisa was here with us now was the exact opposite. Enriching. 
That was what it had been, was now and would ever be. With just one at 
their side either of us could be happy but that was nothing compared 
to the harmony that amplified all of our feelings.
	After a small eternity we pulled apart. I stole a glance at 
Lisa, finding the miko smiling softly, obviously experiencing the same 
recreation of the feelings just rediscovered. Both girls were flushed 
from the way they were woken up and I allowed myself a satisfied 
smirk. Yes, payback was a nice thing... And I wasn&#39;t quite done yet.

******************************

(Makoto)
&quot;She&#39;s going to be fine, Mako-chan, would you calm down?&quot; Hotaru 
repeated softly for the x-thousandth time. Not that it helped much. In 
fact, the way she stood there leaning casually against the doorframe 
of the waiting room was infuriating me even further.
	&quot;How can you be so calm? She got herself nearly killed, went 
through childbirth UNCONSCIOUS and oh, not to mention that your baby 
is nothing more than a piece of jewelry!&quot; I knew I was ranting, I knew 
I was probably being a total pain in the ass but I couldn&#39;t help it. 
Now with the action behind us, with nothing to concentrate on, 
everything that happened the day before was settling in. Not slowly 
but with a big bang. Add to that my own helplessness and frustration 
during the fight and all that followed and my brain was quickly 
shutting down trying to rationally comprehend all the information. And 
Hotaru just stood there as if everything was alright!
	Waking up disorientated in what I later learned was a spaceship 
hovering cloaked in Earth orbit was hard enough to digest but at least 
it gave me something to distract myself with from the more depressing 
and confusing topics. Bringing Minako back down to the surface and 
into the hospital for observation was also helpful to get my mind 
focused on different things. After that though there hadn&#39;t been much 
to do but wait and worry. Hotaru had said that considering the 
spiritual trauma Minako went through and the drain necessary for the 
birth would have her sleeping for some time. As much as I tried I 
couldn&#39;t be quite so optimistic though.
	&quot;Our baby,&quot; Hotaru&#39;s calm but suddenly sharp voice penetrated 
through the distracting haze of my flashback. I turned my head to look 
at her, seeing a hard edge suddenly had entered purple eyes which made 
me momentarily sway in my ranting mood.
	Fried nerves quickly took over again though. &quot;Oh come on now, 
not that again... You are just...&quot;
	&quot;You FELT it, did you not?&quot;
	I froze, a memory of the recent events boring through the wall 
of denial and self-illusion. A wall that was easier to deal with 
because the truth behind it, the truth the memory evoked made this 
whole damn thing even harder to deal with. I gritted my teeth and 
continued my pacing until I turned around then stalked right up to 
Hotaru, looming over the smaller girl who just looked up with the same 
calm expression. Underneath though I could detect the barest hint 
of... annoyance, aggravation and... impatience.
	&quot;You know it is true, Makoto,&quot; Hotaru stated again, not looking 
away under the heated glare.
	&quot;And you think that&#39;s supposed to make me feel better?&quot; I 
answered quietly, a slight chill entering my voice. &quot;It is supposed to 
make me feel better to know that it is also MY child that is now...&quot; I 
trailed off, the simple thought of just finishing the statement aloud 
was repulsing. I had just taken a look at the undeveloped star seed, 
the remaining truth of what was supposed to be a human, a life form, 
a...
	&quot;Now what?&quot; Hotaru asked almost innocently but the look in her 
eyes belied the seriousness of the question. She was very aware what I 
was thinking and she wanted me to say it, to face this. It hurt 
inside, to admit the truth of what the connection which had undeniable 
developed between us revealed and then seeing just what had become of 
that truth.
	My lips worked silently but for a long time nothing came out. I 
couldn&#39;t say it to her face. As angry as I was, I couldn&#39;t just throw 
the words in Hotaru&#39;s face. Turning around I quietly walked back into 
the empty room, feeling overwhelmed and almost desperate to understand 
the other girl&#39;s reason for her attitude. I wished I could be so calm. 
I wished I could understand all that which she apparently did, all 
those missing links. It was getting too hard to keep track of, to hard 
to just simply take in stride. I had reached a point where rational 
thought had become almost impossible. &quot;You know what I mean. You know 
damn well what I mean. She&#39;s supposed to be flesh and blood, a happy, 
healthy, little baby, not just a tiny crystal that...&quot; I broke off 
again, digging my hands roughly into the backrest of one of the 
chairs, trying to get a hold of my troubled feelings before I really 
exploded.
	&quot;The seed is her, just as yours is you, and mine is me. It&#39;s a 
miracle that the seed even survived considering all that happened. It 
just needs a little time to develop...&quot;
	&quot;Didn&#39;t you want the kid at all?&quot; I growled out, knowing on some 
level that that had been an unfair low blow. I was proven right as 
barely a moment passed before Hotaru had abandoned her spot, one hand 
grasping my arm with a strength one barely would expect from such a 
fragile-looking girl. I turned with the urging movement, flinching 
slightly under the hurt gaze. I shrugged free of the grasp and put 
some distance between us again. The anger and frustration inside of me 
not able to yield at the moment. &quot;Sorry,&quot; I muttered but kept walking 
until it was now me who stood at the door.
	&quot;You know I do want the baby. We agreed on that, didn&#39;t we?&quot; 
Hotaru&#39;s voice was soft, only the slightest hint of the hurt my 
accusation must have inflicted audible. I admired and envied her for 
the level of self-control. If not for her, this whole bizarre mess 
between Minako, her and myself had probably been blown up in our faces 
already. &quot;Why can&#39;t you trust me when I&#39;m telling you not to worry, 
that everything&#39;s fine all things considered?&quot; The question hurt even 
more, fueling the whispering voice of doubt in my heart that had been 
momentarily quieted in the heat of the events but hadn&#39;t given up 
quite yet.
	&quot;I&#39;m trying to, Hotaru-chan. But I really can&#39;t understand how 
you can be so calm when your daughter barely survived and is now 
nothing more than the core of what she is supposed to be, put in 
suspended animation until she might one day be ready to really be 
born,&quot; I hissed the last part. I had half turned around, the impulses 
overriding every other emotion but the softly spoken reply drained all 
the anger I wanted to direct at someone from me and only left a gaping 
hole of shame and guilt behind.
	&quot;Would you rather have it that OUR daughter has to be here now? 
Here, in the middle of what soon will be a war zone? Here, where soon 
we fill fight our very existence? A fight that has a high possibility 
of some or maybe all of us not surviving?&quot;
	I felt suddenly empty, my strength fading away and I had to lean 
with my head against the doorframe for support as Hotaru&#39;s words of 
logic cut through all the arguments I could come up with, ripping them 
apart and leaving me helpless, once again helpless, unable to direct 
all the jumbled emotions inside of me at anyone but myself. She was 
right, of course. I knew the moment the words registered that there 
was no way to challenge the logic behind the statement. &quot;I...&quot; I 
fumbled for words, finding it hard to even speak, desperately 
searching for words but not finding. &quot;Kami-sama, gomen nasei, I...&quot; It 
sounded so lame and I wanted to hit myself for being so damn stupid, 
for not seeing the reasoning behind Hotaru&#39;s calmness.
	I jerked my shoulder away from the gentle touch but didn&#39;t say 
anything else, just staying like I was. Hotaru, having approached 
behind me, hesitated obviously. I almost expected her, maybe wished 
for her to just hug me and be done with it. But she didn&#39;t and I 
honestly had no idea what to make of this, how to deal with all of 
this.
	I felt inadequate, the doubts about my place in this 
relationship returning full force and the vulnerability brought about 
by this situation was perfect nutrition for it.
	&quot;Minako needs us now, Mako-chan. This will be even harder on her 
as it is on us. Don&#39;t think I&#39;m completely above all that. Really, I 
am anything but. I&#39;m just trying to not make this any worse by 
worrying myself to death.&quot;
	&quot;But that&#39;s just it,&quot; I replied, voice tight, &quot;I&#39;m just making a 
fool out of myself. Whatever did I do for you when just being in the 
way? You two, you are just right for each other. I am just...&quot;
	&quot;Mako-chan, don&#39;t...&quot; Hotaru pleaded desperately and I&#39;m sure 
had I looked at her now it would have broken me in two right away. 
Truth was I didn&#39;t even want to say those things but they just spilled 
out. The doubt and guilt having taken firm control and not letting go 
again. I was losing it and I would end up hurting everyone, especially 
Hotaru, even more the longer I staid. Concentrating on the last 
remains of control I could muster, I pushed forward out of the door. 
&quot;I... I need to take a walk,&quot; I muttered. &quot;Take care of Minako.&quot; 
Ignoring Hotaru&#39;s calls for me stop I was out in the hallway and soon 
enough out of the hospital itself, taking to the rooftops from there 
and heading in the direction of my sensei&#39;s dojo. I needed to get my 
mind cleared, I needed to get everything back into focus before I did 
something irrational and rash that I would end up regretting for the 
rest of my life.

******************************

&lt;200021 BC ()&gt;
The nights out in the wild free nature, far away from the bustle of 
the villages, larger towns and cities were refreshing. The two young 
woman, more or less still girls, currently resting on a small hill, 
wrapped in the shadows of the night, only illuminated by the soft 
light of the Moon always enjoyed to stay outside, especially in the 
warmer months. There was nothing to be said against the nice 
comfortable bed of an inn room but out here they felt much more in 
tune with life, they felt the harmony between the world&#39;s and their 
own nature. And they were blissfully alone for miles to come most of 
the time...
	The air wasn&#39;t really cold, it was one of the hottest months of 
the year and they seldom needed one anyway. They liked to be alone 
with each other, undisturbed by anything other than nature&#39;s caress. 
Sixteen year-old Phoebe was currently laying on her side with her head 
rested in her partner&#39;s lap and one hand reaching up to play with 
golden-blonde hair absently. Peitho, in a relaxed sitting position, 
was alternating her gaze between star gazing and looking at her mate, 
an action which the other girl mirrored and somehow always managed to 
glance towards the two years older Senshi in synch with her so that 
their eyes would met, speaking of unrestrained affection, 
unconditional love.
	&quot;I wonder what they hold. So many of them, so many lives. We are 
supposed to protect them, don&#39;t we, and yet we haven&#39;t even been 
further than one or two visits to our planets,&quot; the Senshi of Love 
mused slightly, starting to mirror the dark-haired girl&#39;s motions with 
her own and producing a content sigh in the process.
	Phoebe closed her eyes, breathing in the scent of her mate 
carried towards her by a chilly breeze. A slight shiver ran down her 
spine and in response she snuggled closer into the warmth provided by 
the other. Peitho was always getting so... moody in nights like this. 
Romantic, yes, but also poetic and sometimes slightly depressed for no 
real reason. After all, they had each other. So what reason would she 
have to be depressed? &quot;Why, you are going to plan and leave me to 
explore the stars?&quot; the Senshi of Silence teased lightly, knowing that 
the other would pick up on the playful tone.
	&quot;A fascinating idea,&quot; the older woman stated in a voice that 
ALMOST managed to sound sincerely contemplative. Phoebe merely smiled 
quietly to herself, enjoying the comfortable silence that followed, 
the feeling of the long hair entwined in her fingers and the feel of 
the other&#39;s own strokes, occasionally caressing the skin of her face. 
It was a truly peaceful moment. At least until the other Senshi added 
in an odd voice that now really sounded serious, &quot;I might do that 
sometime, you know.&quot;
	Purple eyes fluttered open, gazing in honest bewilderment at the 
woman she had known since she was young, not quite believing what she 
thought to have heard. Peitho smiled knowingly. A reassuring but 
somewhat wistful smile. &quot;I mean, we are special, aren&#39;t we? Pluto told 
us that our star seeds have the ability to rebirth, a new body than 
this one dies. There are so many lives out there. Who knows if we 
might not fall in love with someone else in the next life or the one 
after that or... You see what I mean.&quot;
	The younger warrior was quiet for a long moment, trying to make 
sense of her companion&#39;s words. She knew it was in the blonde&#39;s nature 
to see things like that, muse about them and usually she didn&#39;t really 
mind. Now though, now something needed to be clarified. &quot;I love you 
and I will always love you, in this life, in the next and in any other 
that follows. You complete me Peitho.&quot;
	A warm smile danced around the older warrior&#39;s lips. She bent 
down gently to put a chaste, lingering kiss on the Phoebe&#39;s lips. &quot;I 
feel the same way. Exactly the same. I maybe able to bring others 
together, see who is meant to be with whom. But only you were able to 
show me that love personally. Only you can make me happy.&quot; She needed 
to clarify, seeing that she had done a poor explanation of what had 
been on her mind. Peitho straightened up again, smirking slightly at 
the dreamy look on the pale face below.
	&quot;That&#39;s not what I mean though,&quot; she continued seriously. &quot;Love 
isn&#39;t something that just repeats itself because it was formed in a 
life generations backwards. We might be drawn to each other but not 
act on it. We might fall in love with someone else, real true love. 
But that wouldn&#39;t change anything about what we share...&quot; The blonde 
girl wasn&#39;t quite sure what exactly brought that on. The last years 
had been wonderful, traveling the world, with the one person 
constantly at her side that truly completed her. Maybe, she kind of 
waited for the other shoe to drop, that something would come to 
disrupt the tranquility and happiness of their life... Maybe she was 
just too melancholic.
	&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter what happens in some far away life. What 
matters is here and now,&quot; Phoebe stated in a soft but firm voice, 
sensing the mood of her mate. &quot;I will always be by your side and if 
for some reason not, I WILL find you again.&quot; The two Senshi held their 
gazes for nearly a minute, only the sounds of nature around them 
filling the silence. Peitho&#39;s heart swelled at the love and devotion 
in the normally cool and reserved woman&#39;s features, once again being 
reminded of the fantastic gift that she had been given, a gift that 
needed to be cherished and not questioned.
	&quot;Do you think we could fall in love with someone else and still 
love each other,&quot; Phoebe asked suddenly, voice unsure and a bit 
distant. The Senshi of Love blinked, noticing the faraway look her 
companion sometimes got when she had a vision, it seemed more like a 
sudden presentiment somehow. She had gotten used to them but never had 
it been addressing something so... personal to them.
	Grasping one of Phoebe&#39;s hands she squeezed slightly. &quot;Maybe. 
Could you?&quot;
	There was a moment of hesitation, then an uncertain nod, &quot;I get 
the feeling sometimes there is more for us out there. Not something 
that will disrupt us but... you know...&quot;
	&quot;Needs to be added to truly complete us?&quot; Peitho inquired 
gently, sensing her mate&#39;s struggle for the right words. Frankly 
sometimes she had the same feeling. Brief, fleeting, more 
precognitive, about something far away in the future, not relevant 
now. Being the Senshi of Love made her more aware of the flow of bonds 
that human and other life form&#39;s souls could engage in and as that 
could interpret such small feelings of maybe a missing part of a 
connection that might be meant to be there sometimes but wasn&#39;t at the 
moment.
	Phoebe gave a tiny nod, feeling relief at seeing the recognition 
and understanding in the other&#39;s eyes. They had obviously thought 
along the same lines again, after all. She answered Peitho&#39;s soft 
smile as hearts expressed what words could not. Then, not really 
hesitating but more thoughtful the dark-haired Senshi said, &quot;I wonder 
if we are ever going to have a family.&quot;
	&quot;Would you like one?&quot; Peitho asked, searching her partner&#39;s eyes 
for just how much it mattered to her. Admissions like these were rare, 
regardless of how open Phoebe was with her and her alone.
	Phoebe paused to give her answer but then softly admitted, 
&quot;Yes.&quot; Reaching up to draw her mate down into a kiss that began to 
tear at the gentle, tranquil mood, quickly drifting into passion, she 
added, &quot;But as I said, that is in the future, this is now. And you are 
getting much too moody for me right now to further dwell on it.&quot;
	And with that the issue was dropped but often wondered about in 
the years to come and after they really were separated as consequence 
of the war, the moment was thought back upon with a bittersweet 
aftertaste. Right now though they would be too occupied to care and 
were certainly too occupied to notice that the glow of the silvery 
Moon had intensified quite a bit. The foundation for one of the 
answers to Phoebe&#39;s question would be born into this world soon...

******************************

&lt;Present Time (Minako)&gt;
Gradually my senses began to return, awareness slowly settled in as 
the black void of unconsciousness was parted like a veil. The glaring 
light streaming in made me blink several times before I could even 
remotely attempt to make out anything more detailed. I closed them 
again for a short while and concentrated on my other senses, slowly 
finding my mind restarting and filling me with my last impression 
before waking up and in a state of wonder I also noticed that - taken 
aside the drained state of my internal energy supplies - I felt 
remarkable... fine.
	Slowly I tried again to open my eyes against the artificial 
glare of the neon lights above. &#39;Hospital&#39;, a small part of my 
rational mind piped up, but was quickly shut up by the sight that 
greeted me.
	It&#39;s weird how completely at ease I felt considering all that 
happened but that door I had feared to open before was now wide open 
and I... I understood, I simply understood. It was next to impossible 
to put into words but for the first time in a long while - probably 
ever since that day of our parting generations ago - I felt really, 
honestly complete. A soft sigh escaped my lips feeling the gentle 
strokes of fingertips through my hair. I almost regretted making a 
sound as the movement ceased abruptly and deep purple eyes focused on 
my own, a swirl of unguarded emotion breaking through all the walls I 
knew the other was capable of normally.
	&quot;Must be heaven,&quot; I whispered, fighting the numbness in my arm 
as I reached up to tug an errand strand of hair back into place, 
lingering with my fingers on the side of her face. It really felt like 
heaven. Considering that logically I probably should be dead and if I 
was dead the figure above me was an angel greeting me after waking 
from the long nightmare the Seeker&#39;s attack had put me through... It 
was even more heavenly when the realization that all this was quite 
real and alive sank in. &quot;Hey there.&quot; I held the intense gaze with one 
of my own.
	&quot;Hey,&quot; Hotaru tried hard to sound calm but her voice was 
cracking. &quot;You gave us quite a scare.&quot;
	I smiled weakly, trying to somehow reassure the other girl but 
it was clear that there was nothing much I could. Knowing her she 
probably kept all of her own concerns inside until now. I was about to 
say something when the rest of my mind arrived back on this plane and 
a couple of things registered as... missing. They didn&#39;t provoke a 
sense of panic or loss but they were definitely missing. &quot;Where&#39;s 
Mako-chan?&quot; I asked first, feeling over the bond a lot of mixed 
feelings from her end... and she wasn&#39;t in the immediate area either.
	&quot;She...&quot; Hotaru glanced away but not before I caught a glimpse 
of sad confusion. &quot;She left a little while ago. Said she needed &#39;to 
take a walk&#39;.&quot; The tone used for the quotation didn&#39;t leave much room 
for speculation. I knew Makoto and now looking back on the last months 
without the hindrances, the barriers I had put around myself I could 
see the signs that the brunette was obviously having her doubts about 
her place in the shaky relationship between us. Kind of ironic when 
you think about it. I had had the same doubts. Heck, I had told myself 
over and over again that they probably would be better of without me. 
In the long run I would even agree now considering the state I had 
been in.
	&quot;Hey, don&#39;t worry about it. She&#39;ll come back. She&#39;s just 
stubborn and needs some time to work things out for herself.&quot;  Gently 
I urged Hotaru to focus on me again. &quot;She belongs with us now. You 
know that, I know that and she&#39;ll understand that too,&quot; I emphasized 
softly but trying to convey the deeper meaning. Apparently Hotaru did 
pick up on it because a hesitant, hopeful and almost giddy smile began 
to spread over her lips.
	&quot;You do understand,&quot; she said not as a question but a statement, 
not to me but more to herself for clarification. &quot;You do understand,&quot; 
she repeated in a breathless whisper. I could see the moisture 
gathering in her eyes and wiped the tear away gently before it could 
even spill over the beautiful face.
	&quot;I do, Phoebe. I do.&quot;
	She looked so vulnerable now. If any of her former enemies could 
see her now they would hardly be able to make the connection between 
the cold, calculating warrior and the young woman on the verge of an 
emotional breakdown. Despite all that her face was glowing with 
happiness though which made me feel all warm inside.
	Gathering the little strength I could still find I pushed up 
slightly so that I could pull the smaller girl into an embrace, 
basking in the renewal of what once had been and was now against 
impossible odds been given a second chance. &quot;I love you,&quot; I breathed 
into dark hair, trying to put all the truth and feelings into the 
words that I hadn&#39;t been able to say before. As much as the agony 
inflicted by the Seeker had been an experience I didn&#39;t wish to repeat 
for the rest of all my lifetimes, I had to be thankful for one thing. 
My search had finally found an end because I had found that one 
missing key to my heart I had never been able to find again before. 
The relief and inner peace filling me now was hard to describe and 
managed to chase away the memories of the traumatic events quite 
effectively.
	We stayed that way for awhile before I slowly loosened my arms 
around the other girl&#39;s frame. Hotaru quite obviously didn&#39;t want to 
move but saw that I was trying hard not to just fall back onto my 
back. Which I promptly did after she settled back into her chair.
	&quot;So,&quot; I asked in a cheerful voice, trying to break the heavy 
moment, &quot;Where&#39;s the little bugger that annoyed me so much the last 
months?&quot; The cheer was an easy distraction, of course, a distraction 
that was also feeling nicely. The thing was I did feel the fourth 
presence in the background but it was muted and very dim. I had been 
relieved already to note that apparently the child did survive the 
ordeal. How exactly I couldn&#39;t quite fathom though. I had avoided 
thinking about what exactly happened after the attack onwards but now 
with the emotional confession I felt compelled to do out of the way, 
the nervousness and anxiety began to creep into my heart.
	&quot;She&#39;s safe,&quot; Hotaru said quietly. I couldn&#39;t pinpoint why but 
somehow I had the feeling that was one of the reasons I received such 
an agitated feedback from Makoto. &quot;As safe as possible in a situation 
like this.&quot; The other girl gazed back at me, her eyes almost pleading 
and the next word came in a whisper. &quot;At least... at least the seed 
is...&quot;
	I blinked, for a moment not really comprehending, but then my 
mind managed to work out the meaning behind the words. &quot;Oh,&quot; I said, 
sounding rather stupidly I decided. Truthfully a mixture of emotions 
rushed through me as the implications sank in but I tried to focus on 
Hotaru who seemed rather nervous about my reaction. Reaching out to 
grasp one of her hands I gave a small squeeze of reassurance. &quot;I&#39;m 
sure you did all that could you.&quot;
	Hotaru tried a small smile but it came across as rather weak. 
&quot;Not me. I couldn&#39;t have done anything, you know that. Even if, I 
think I was much too... shocked and frantic at that moment. You&#39;ll 
have to thank Tsunami-chan.&quot; This time the smile was real and laced 
with a great deal of affection.
	I had to admit the answer kind of floored me. &quot;Tsunami-chan? 
She&#39;s still... Oh... right, Sasami. Sorry, sleepy mind trying to work 
two parallel sets of memories and combining them.&quot; I laughed softly, 
the sound oddly refreshing. I couldn&#39;t stress the point enough in my 
mind how much I felt like a newborn child right now, purged from the 
confusion, hesitation and the many barriers that had dominated my life 
before. I felt so... free. Maybe I should sent Pandora a &quot;thank you&quot; 
card? Hmm...
	&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Hotaru chuckled quietly, reaching over with her 
other hand to wind it into my long hair. &quot;No haste.&quot; With a smirk she 
added, &quot;You won&#39;t ever believe what our little girl turned out to be.&quot; 
Then her humor fell though into a more somber mood. Recalling similar 
moments from Peitho&#39;s memories I could easily see that the events 
began to catch up to her and she was torn between being happy about 
the one thing and worried and sad about the other.
	&quot;Why don&#39;t you tell me about all that I missed until Mako-chan 
comes back?&quot; I asked, fighting the urge to yawn. Considering that I 
had been out of it for over a day - which a glance at a calendar on 
the wall had told me - I was still rather tired. Then again, after 
what my body - and soul - had been through I should be happy to still 
be alive and mostly unscathed.
	&quot;You really think she&#39;s coming back,&quot; Hotaru said, practically 
scared. She didn&#39;t say it out loud but I saw in her eyes the 
loneliness there, the loneliness brought about our separation and the 
frustration at my own... disregard of her feelings. She didn&#39;t want to 
lose someone she loved again, I realized with a start.
	&quot;Hey, don&#39;t worry your pretty head,&quot; I smiled reassuringly. I 
had known Makoto for some time now and from the time we&#39;ve spent 
together I knew that everything that she couldn&#39;t grasp properly, 
everything that appeared too high or too much for her to deal with 
tended to frustrate her a great deal. &quot;There&#39;s only so much even 
someone as tough as Mako-chan can take. At some point your inner 
nature just breaks through and you can&#39;t stop it. Let her cool off a 
bit,&quot; I tried to make a convincing point. &quot;And if she doesn&#39;t come 
around by herself, we just have to go hunt her down, ne?&quot;
	&quot;With a big bow and a heart-shaped arrow?&quot; Hotaru asked in a 
cute display of mock-hopefulness.
	I smirked in return. &quot;I&#39;m sure I can still hit from long 
distance.&quot;

******************************

(Persephone)
How much time had passed since I last came here? Here, in the vast 
infinities of a place that existed outside of anything and still in 
the very center of everything. Once it had been a place of joy, a 
timeless beauty with vast planes, forests and other sorts of nature 
reflections. It had been a warm place, just for the two who dwelled 
here, endlessly keeping watch over the most important gate in 
existence.
	A reflection of the guardians&#39; hearts. Now only a single 
guardian remained and that one&#39;s heart had been horribly hurt, forced 
to endure the pains of solitude and loneliness, the heavy mantle of 
duty all by herself. This heart had shied away from the world outside, 
fearful of the loses that ultimately awaited her there.
	Now the Cocoon of Time was just filled with endless emptiness 
and deep mists shrouding everything into mystery, like shields, 
concealments from the harshness of the world.
	A single tear slid down my face. &#39;Oh, Oneechan, what has 
happened to you?&#39; Of course I knew what. I had watched her those last 
centuries since my spirit at least had been able to make some contact 
with the outside world again. I had went back and watched with a heavy 
heart of immeasurable sadness in the endless flow of time of those 
events that had happened since we parted ways so painfully. And my 
heart had wept with the realization of what my dearest sister had to 
endure all on her own. This was the very reason why a Time Guardian 
was not meant to be alone. Their post and duty was one of the most 
difficult and painful.
	As the mists parted to reveal the majestic doors of the Time 
Gate I stopped in my tracks, soft footfalls falling silent and my gaze 
was directed forward, not daring to even move an inch from Pluto&#39;s 
form. The entire plane held its breath, literally, as for the first 
time in over two hundred millennia both its guardians had set foot 
upon it. I searched the other woman&#39;s dark crimson eyes and winced 
slightly under the infinite amount of pain and loneliness stowed in 
there. It had become harder for her to bear the secluded vigil and 
eventually circumstances had made her begin to mingle with the normal 
flow of time once again... But in the end nothing had been able to 
take away the experiences that came with her duty. Nothing could ever 
soothe that raging inferno of having seen too much that she was unable 
to prevent. Generations going by, one loved one after another. Only I 
could. I knew how it was, what our duty entailed and being separated 
from her, the only one who understood just as much as me, was pure 
torture.
	Pluto moved forward slowly, her steps tentative, almost 
hesitant. I stood my ground barely daring to breathe. Oh, how often I 
had wished in the last years to make my presence known to her, to be 
with her again. I could have, really I could, however, the 
consequences would have been disastrous. The other Senshi came to a 
stop just in front of me, eyes still locked on mine, as she reached up 
to tenderly touch my face, tracing the skin of my cheek as if I was 
going to disappear the next moment, crumble like a piece of 
easy-to-break porcelain. A small smile formed on my lips, trying to 
convey reassurance but frankly my own emotions were in turmoil and I 
barely had any control left.
	Crimson eyes widened in disbelief and amazement. &quot;You&#39;re 
alive...&quot; The words were not a question but neither a real statement 
either. More like a fact from a fairytale, something that you knew 
couldn&#39;t be real but strangely enough felt so very real. The carefully 
measured, ages-old mask crumbled within the speed of a single timeless 
moment of undeniable realization.
	I threw control out of the window. &quot;Oneechan,&quot; I breathed, just 
before flinging myself forward, wrapping the slightly taller woman 
into an embrace and without a further word pressed my lips against her 
own. For a moment Pluto was completely overwhelmed but then the 
response came and all the bottled up emotions I had seen before in her 
eyes, had understood like no one over could, came rushing out like a 
cascade. Everything around us melted away as the two oldest Senshi 
souls met in renewal of a connection so pure as it was ancient. My 
eyes had closed and I was pretty sure so had the other woman&#39;s as 
nothing else mattered for the moment. Too much time had passed, too 
much loneliness had been endured in the face of our separation. 
Questions could come later. This was how it was meant to be, how it 
had been once before and how it would - yes, I swear it would - be 
again. Finally we could be there for each other again, share the 
burden that had been our duty from the day of our birth onwards.
	Even as the kiss finally ended, neither of us let go. I had my 
head rested against the taller Senshi&#39;s shoulder as we continued to 
hold each other. No one said a word but the silence wasn&#39;t empty, it 
wasn&#39;t filled with the vast loneliness I had felt the moment I entered 
this plane. For a first time in ages the silence was reflecting the 
deep inner peace of its guardians again as their love washed away the 
other&#39;s darkness.
	&quot;You were right,&quot; Pluto said quietly after a near infinite time 
and the pain in her voice was disturbing to witness. &quot;You were right,&quot; 
she repeated. &quot;Emotional bindings with those in the flow will only 
lead to heartache.&quot;
	&quot;But you still made them,&quot; I stated softly. &quot;Even now, after all 
this. Why?&quot; There was a long pause and I pulled back to see the 
other&#39;s face, shedding a few tears at the conflicting emotions. I 
gently began stroking the familiar features, mesmerizing each curve 
again after such a long time. &quot;Because no one can endure the 
loneliness all by herself.&quot; I spoke softly but insistent. &quot;We were 
both right. In the end there is no way for us to escape that 
predicament.&quot; I brought my face close to hers, never breaking eye 
contact, reading and drinking the deepest secrets of her soul within a 
heartbeat. &quot;But, Aion-chan, that&#39;s why you have me.&quot;
	&quot;I thought I lost you,&quot; my sister sniffed and I was pretty sure 
everyone who believed to know her would be shocked at the open grief 
and searing pain in the gaze at the memories that surely had to have 
been foremost in her mind... because they were foremost in my mind 
too.
	I leaned forward bringing our lips together again. I could feel 
Pluto&#39;s body trembling, strength draining out of her but easily 
shifted so that I could support her. &quot;Shh, I know,&quot; I whispered upon 
parting. &quot;I didn&#39;t think I could ever see you again, too. And when I 
learned how much you went through...&quot; My throat felt dry all of a 
sudden as I swallowed. &quot;It hurt so much.&quot;
	&quot;How...?&quot; Pluto began but in her eyes I could see clearly that 
at the moment she really didn&#39;t care about the hows and whys, about 
the circumstances of what happened to me. And I don&#39;t think she was in 
the right mood to deal with my own story of a lone vigil.
	&quot;I love you so much,&quot; I breathed, instantly killing any 
questions, any need for knowledge. My own vision blurred and so I 
couldn&#39;t be sure which tears were whose. Not that it mattered.
	&quot;You still do?&quot; Pluto&#39;s voice was tiny, scared, the voice of 
someone who had given up hope long ago, only leaving the tiniest flame 
behind. A flame that unexpectedly had received new air so that it 
burst into a new brilliant brightness. The question was ridiculous. 
There never had been anyone else. I never ever could not love her, 
regardless of how long our separation had been. We were made for each 
other, literally.
	&quot;Let me show you,&quot; I replied, voice trembling as I pulled the 
other Senshi closer, touching lips again as my hands tangled in the 
long dark hair falling over my sister&#39;s and soul mate&#39;s back.

******************************

(Tomoyo)
The air was clean and a soft spring breeze caressed my skin. I had my 
eyes closed as I stood outside, momentarily blocking out the not so 
pretty sight of the yard. Considering the kind of danger we had been 
in, it wasn&#39;t even all that bad. Still... I knew it was ridiculous but 
a part of me did feel guilty and responsible. Despite that, we were 
now family, sort of, so I felt like this was a violation of my home as 
well.
	A smile tucked at my lips at the memory of the night before. 
Okay, technically it had been around early afternoon or something but 
it felt more appropriate to be classified as night activity after all. 
My cheeks heated up a little but the smile actually deepened.
	&quot;You seem to be rather happy this afternoon.&quot; I blinked my eyes 
open but didn&#39;t turn or show any other sign of my surprise. I had 
gotten used to it over the hours spent into the elderly woman&#39;s 
presence. The head priestess of the Jinseikuro Jinja insisted that the 
silent approach was part of the daily training... Personally I thought 
she just liked to do it for some weird reason but I was too polite to 
say it out loud.
	&quot;Oh, I am,&quot; I replied instead, looking outwards at the scenery 
of the city and the slowly descending sun. It was already late 
afternoon. We had slept quite a long time after the activities had 
been over yesterday - both the negative and the positive ones - and 
after waking up fairly early in the morning, neither of us had been 
quite ready to leave the warmth of the bed... or better each other. 
Not to mention that Sakura wouldn&#39;t let us...
	Lisa&#39;s grandmother stepped up next to me, taking in the damage 
done in the battle and seemingly discarding it as irrelevant with a 
slight shake of her head. &quot;So it would appear. It is remarkable that a 
young woman such as yourself would be so open and accepting when she 
already is so much in love.&quot; From the rather casual conversation tone 
I had the impression that an explanation was fairly unnecessary but I 
felt compelled to answer anyway.
	&quot;I trust Sakura,&quot; I stated as if those few words answered 
anything. Actually they did. I had had my doubts concerning Sylphiel, 
or Lisa now, but never did I ever doubt Sakura&#39;s loyalty. Too much had 
happened for that. I knew that whatever still would happen, I could 
trust that she would neither leave nor hurt me intentionally. &quot;And 
it&#39;s not just that. I feel like I&#39;ve fallen in love all over again. 
Just like when I met Sakura, it&#39;s the same feeling that I have for 
your granddaughter. Not just because we used to be together in a past 
life but... Well, what are names? In the end they are just labels we 
chose to define ourselves with. Who can tell us why we fall in love 
with someone? Nobody really can and I think that&#39;s a good thing. I do 
not understand why people always try to look for the negative when 
they see people in love who are different or whose relationship is 
different. I think you should see love like it is. Love.&quot;
	I turned to look at the older woman, being greeted by a warm 
smile. &quot;It does this old heart good to hear such honest and truthful 
words spoken by someone several decades younger.&quot; She reached out and 
took my hand, a moment of solemn silence hanging over us. &quot;I am sure 
you will take good care of her. I have never seen her so vibrant as 
today. I knew from the first moment I saw the three of you together, 
that you belonged with each other.&quot;
	&quot;We will and we do,&quot; I felt the urge to clarify both points with 
unwavering seriousness. Lisa&#39;s grandmother nodded with an equal 
expression.
	After that I headed back inside, finding Sakura and Lisa after 
some searching in a smaller room upstairs that was filled with all 
kinds of - too the untrained eye - weird stuff. I could see though 
that most of this here was mystical in nature and rather old. I had 
always had a soft spot for archeology and after Sakura&#39;s adventures 
with the cards I had become more and more interested in some of the 
more mysterious items found in human history. A good deal of those 
which I had read about were filling the shelves or were being spread 
over the ground in a circle around the two girls sitting in its 
center, talking excitedly.
	&quot;... I can&#39;t believe you actually found this.&quot; Sakura was 
weighing a mighty-looking lance in her hands that was richly decorated 
and if I didn&#39;t know any better I could have sworn it was... &quot;Odin&#39;s 
Gungnir.&quot; I faltered a little as I made my way carefully over to sit 
on a chair next to the pair. So I had been right! My eyes widened 
slightly in amazement. This had to be one of, if not THE most valuable 
treasure in here. Lisa had already told us that she had traveled a 
lot, pretty much all across the world. Obviously she hadn&#39;t just been 
sightseeing.
	&quot;It wasn&#39;t easy to get believe me. Unfortunately I don&#39;t have 
the right mindset to get anything out of it,&quot; Lisa smiled without 
seeming really sad about the fact. &quot;It seems to like you though.&quot; 
Sakura blinked and I followed her gaze downwards to the weapon in her 
hands surrounded by a soft crimson glow. &quot;You probably won&#39;t believe 
that almost none of these things I really had actively sought out?&quot;
	Sakura glanced up again. &quot;I can hardly picture you as a treasure 
hunter,&quot; she laughed merrily, &quot;I still remember those few times we 
took you along on a raid.&quot; Judged by the blush on the purple-haired 
girl&#39;s face I figured it must have been a rather fun event, too bad I 
couldn&#39;t quite recall it. There was some faint memory but I was too 
engrossed in the present to really focus on it.
	&quot;The only thing ever really of worth to me is this.&quot; She tapped 
with a finger against the ring on her other hand and the gesture 
clearly indicated both object and what it hosted. I didn&#39;t know much 
about the kind of bond Lisa and the Sylph shared, however, from what 
I&#39;ve seen the affection was impossible to deny. Due to the exposure to 
the Clow Cards who were similar in nature my grasp on the concept of 
elemental spirits was probably better than any of the other mystical 
fields at the moment. And Sylph&#39;s weren&#39;t known to be easily violent 
and aggressive, even if provoked, as Lisa&#39;s elemental had been during 
the fight.
	&quot;Those are pretty rare. I didn&#39;t even know they still made 
contract rings. This kind of binding items were almost considered 
extinct in the old times already,&quot; Sakura stated before turning to 
look at me, as if just now realizing that I had been there. Of course 
that wasn&#39;t true. She had to have known, both of them actually should. 
I didn&#39;t want to interrupt either, content to watch their easy 
conversation and the emotions between them expressed in so many little 
details.
	I didn&#39;t feel jealous. It didn&#39;t even surprise me anymore. Not 
after last night. There was virtually no way I could ever be jealous 
or feeling left out. All watching those two interact with the ease of 
old lovers and the eagerness of new at the same time left behind was 
joy. Joy for their happiness because their happiness was my happiness, 
our happiness. It really was impossible to explain to an outsider and 
a complete stranger would probably just shake their head. I doubted 
either of us did or would care.
	&quot;Don&#39;t let me interrupt you,&quot; I said smiling but knew that the 
moment was broken when two sets of eyes, one gold, the other green 
focused on my own. Not that I felt sad about it because this was even 
far better than to simply watch. The harmony created between us was 
practically tangible. Don&#39;t get me wrong. It was amazing. That I could 
feel that way again, over someone other than Sakura. What I said to 
Lisa&#39;s grandmother was the truth but almost nine years ago, back in 
3rd grade when I first met Sakura... I could have steadfastly sworn 
that there would NEVER be another.
	So much had changed since then and now I could welcome and 
accept the change with the assurance that it never was a question of 
exchanging my love for Sakura for another, but instead it had now 
expanded to another, completing that which already was between us. 
There was no question left in my heart anymore. Lisa had been, was and 
would ever be OUR significant other.

(Makoto)
Morning dawned over the remote building complex just on the outskirts 
of Minato-ku. The part here was rather cut off from the rows of 
buildings on the main streets but not a total refugee. Remarkably 
enough the restaurant part of the complex was well frequented and made 
astonishing sales for being so far away from the main business areas. 
I wasn&#39;t surprised, considering the quality of the offered food.
	The sun was slowly rising over the horizon. I could feel the 
flow of nature, the eternal cycle of day and night, dawn and dusk. 
However, right now the feeling had a distant shadow carved into it. It 
was more like the Earth expected to never see the light of dawn again. 
All the life forms around here were restless, sensing the darkness 
wishing to consume them. Their bonds to the planet cried out to them, 
to get away. But where were they supposed to go?
	I almost fell over, unprepared for the human missile launching 
itself at me with an exhilarated cry, &quot;Good morning, Makoto-neechan!&quot; 
Reflexes took over as I caught the younger girl in mid-tackle and 
shifted my balance so that I was able to fetch her out of the air and 
settle her down in my lap which, let me tell you, wasn&#39;t easy to do 
with a twelve year old bundle of energy who had inherited the skill 
and power of her parents. We&#39;ve sparred a few times for fun and she 
was almost as fast as me already...
	&quot;You are up early, squirt,&quot; I mentioned, ruffling her dark 
crimson hair put up into two ponytails but unlike Usagi&#39;s odangos the 
hair was curled around two extremely pointed ears.
	The younger girl nodded enthusiastically and tucked at my gi. 
&quot;You gonna play with me today?&quot; Cat-like purplish-pink eyes turned up 
towards me with such innocent playfulness and eagerness it almost hurt 
to look. The ears wiggled a bit for emphasis and I couldn&#39;t help but 
smile at the sight. Especially knowing that despite momentary 
appearance the girl was rather sharp and quick-witted.
	&quot;I think Makoto-san would like to go back to her own family,&quot; 
another voice called out and the younger girl was faced by a stern 
look from her mother. &quot;Go back to the house please, Felina-chan, you 
are disturbing Makoto in her concentration. Breakfast is ready 
anyway.&quot;
	Saotome Mia pouted cutely but obediently did as she was told, 
practically bouncing out of my lap. I had to dodge the widely swinging 
tail so as not to get whacked in the face. For a moment I stared after 
the retreating form, amazed once again by the cross between childish 
innocence and feline grace. If I didn&#39;t know the story behind her I 
would probably be disturbed... just a little bit.
	&quot;She&#39;s a real pain around vacation time when she has nothing to 
focus on. You would think she&#39;d actually sleep in like normal kids 
when they have free time... But no!&quot; Saotome Xian Pu smiled mildly but 
this one gesture showed enough affection, telling easily she did not 
mind her daughter&#39;s antics at all.
	&quot;What is normal anyway? I&#39;ve met so many people telling me 
different things about normal, saw so many things that I now consider 
normal which are the very opposite for others. We should just accept 
the world around us as it is, other people as they are. It&#39;s not like 
we can really change everything around to fit us.&quot; A nice speech 
surely. It would be even nicer if I followed my own advice...
	&quot;That sounds reasonable,&quot; my boss and mentor&#39;s wife admitted. 
&quot;So, I guess you succeed in the task my Airen gave to you?&quot;
	I closed my eyes for a brief moment, reflecting on the events 
since yesterday when I had left the hospital after a confrontation 
with Hotaru. I had sought out the only place of shelter left to me, 
somewhere where I could rest and think about all that happened, away 
from all the chaos. Upon my arrival Saotome-sensei hadn&#39;t even asked 
many questions, just led me into the dojo for a sparring session that 
bordered on a death match... well, for anyone but us probably. I think 
it was the first time he had really needed to go almost all out in 
training since subconsciously I must have fueled my attacks with quite 
a bit of Senshi strength and speed.
	After I had vent my anger and frustration in a surprisingly 
refreshing way, both my mentor and his wife had made me talk about 
what happened. The Senshi secret wasn&#39;t very much one anyway between 
us and so it hadn&#39;t been a problem to relate events as they were. 
Afterwards Sensei had given me the simple task of clearing my mind 
with the Soul of Ice technique... I had tried until late at night but 
never managed to slip into the right frame of my mind.
	They had let me stay overnight and I think this morning it was 
when I really realized just why I hadn&#39;t been able to complete the 
technique. &quot;I don&#39;t think I was meant to succeed,&quot; I answered honestly 
and wasn&#39;t really surprised to see the soft smile on the older woman&#39;s 
lips.
	&quot;Of course you weren&#39;t,&quot; another female voice answered. The 
young-looking woman was almost a spitting image of her daughter, her 
hair tied into a pigtail though and the tail curled around her secure 
and protectively out of the way. She was a little drenched which draw 
an affectionate grin from her... or better his wife. &quot;Little terror,&quot; 
the redhead mumbled, before shaking of the wetness in her hair and 
walking over to me. She knelt down, mirroring my own lotus-style 
position and I didn&#39;t avert my gaze from blue eyes that seemed to be 
reading me like an open book. &quot;I take it then, you learned your 
lesson?&quot;
	I nodded seriously, having given this a lot of thought over the 
two hours I had been here already. &quot;I couldn&#39;t do it because attaining 
the Soul of Ice would have required me to shut out my feelings. But, 
deep inside, that is the last I wanted to do. I would have lied to 
myself, not helping me any further in understanding. All I would have 
done would be running away.&quot;
	&quot;So, tell me then,&quot; Saotome Ranma prodded in a soft voice but 
with a firm edge, &quot;Tell me then that you think they truly do not want 
you there with them right now. Tell me that you feel like you 
shouldn&#39;t be with them.&quot;
	I bowed my head, unable to meet the eyes of my mentor. &quot;I cannot 
do that. I know that it is true. When I reach out to them I can feel 
them calling, worried but still trusting that I&#39;d come back. It is...&quot; 
I paused, trying to find the right words. I had thought long and hard 
about this after my not so wonderful performance yesterday. I had been 
ashamed of myself and once again felt like an intruder who stood too 
far on the outside to fit in, to understand that which was shared 
between my two friends. &quot;It is scary, I admit. I feel inadequate 
compared to what they share. I ask myself how they could possible need 
me, accept me, when they have something so beautiful already.&quot;
	&quot;But shouldn&#39;t that be their choice? You do love them both, 
don&#39;t you?&quot; My mentor&#39;s wife waited for me to nod in unbreakable 
certainty. &quot;Then it should be their choice. You have been offered a 
place in an union with two fellow warriors, two spirits who understand 
you better than anyone else can and who would not wish to change you, 
instead wanting you as you are.&quot; She smiled at her husband-turned-wife 
fondly. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t push that away. Chances like that are rarely 
offered more than once.&quot;
	For a long moment I didn&#39;t say a thing, letting the words sink 
in which I knew to be true already. I could feel them even now and the 
feeling was right. Harmonic. A beautiful harmony that warmed my heart 
and as impossible as it was I couldn&#39;t deny that truth. I wasn&#39;t 
stupid, I had sensed the change in Minako&#39;s aura, I had known that 
Peitho&#39;s memory had reawakened in her and that realization had only 
further made me believe that I was intruding on their harmony. Now, 
when I felt carefully along the bond, I only sensed a feeling of 
dissatisfaction, incompleteness and longing from the other two. And I 
didn&#39;t really understand it.
	&quot;Xian Pu is right,&quot; Sensei said into the silence. &quot;Have a little 
more confidence into yourself and trust the words of those who love 
you. You know in your heart that they are telling the truth, don&#39;t 
you?&quot; I nodded again, a smile slowly but surely creeping into my face. 
&quot;It&#39;s normal to be confused. Heck, it&#39;s taken me more than a year to 
realize what I wanted and there had been a lot of chaos diverting my 
attention.&quot; The man-turned-woman paused to give his wife another look 
that the other seemed to comprehend immediately with the ease of long 
years spent together. &quot;But I had someone offering me shelter and so 
have you. Even if you do not really understand what is inside of you 
yet, there is someone who wants to be there for you. Let them. Listen 
to your own heart and then see if what they offer matches your 
feelings. If they do, you have your answer. Try it, you won&#39;t regret 
it.&quot;
	&quot;Arigato,&quot; I breathed softly, suddenly feeling a lot less heavy 
in my heart. This was not resolved quite yet but the words of the 
older couple had given me new confidence. Now all I needed to do was 
to hope that I hadn&#39;t totally blown my chance with those two kindred 
souls that had offered me their heart. Somehow I doubted that though.
	&quot;Don&#39;t thank us just yet. If you aren&#39;t gone today, I&#39;m going to 
put you into a box and deliver you personally,&quot; Saotome Xian Pu stated 
with a totally serious face, before turning briskly to walk out of the 
dojo. &quot;I insist though that you join us for breakfast.&quot; I laughed 
quietly at the threat, feeling much better already.
	&quot;Oh, don&#39;t laugh. She&#39;s capable of doing that, I tell you.&quot; 
Sensei commented dryly but had to stifle a laugh of his own.

(Ami)
The weekend had gone by now. Monday morning had come around and 
Tokyo&#39;s citizens began their normal routine again, blissfully unaware 
of the events that had transpired outside their narrow little 
worldview. For them nothing really had changed. They didn&#39;t have to 
worry about a dawning apocalypse, probably the biggest possible if one 
could trust the many warnings from different sources. For them it was 
just the typical beginning of a normal week of work. Even here in 
Azabu Central no one quite really knew the significance of room 240 
where Minako rested right now. For anyone but a selected few the young 
woman was just recovering from a hectic delivery circumstances had 
forced to occur outside the hospital. That in fact Aino Minako had 
literally been through hell for the safe birth of her daughter - not 
even to mention that said daughter was the magical product of the 
union of her and two other woman - that wasn&#39;t known to all but a few. 
No, everything was fine for the average Tokyo citizen...
	I took another lazy sip from my coffee before I stepped away 
from the window. Things had finally quieted down a bit and after all 
that happened I had finally some time to relax and reflect. Funny 
thing that. There hadn&#39;t even been anything important that Okaasan or 
I had contributed here other than taking in Minako upon her safe 
return. But after Mamoru&#39;s call we had all been in a state of 
mind-numbing anxiety, not knowing exactly what was going on, what to 
expect. It didn&#39;t help that I picked up the signs of battle but was 
confined to wait here in case of fast intervention...
	One might suspect that I would be frustrated after all the work 
we had gone through to cloak Minako&#39;s pregnancy as a normal one with 
just a select few knowing the real circumstances. Quite frankly, I was 
actually relieved. Something Okaasan told me once came to mind. In the 
end it didn&#39;t matter how a patient had been healed or by who. What 
should matter to a doctor more than anything was that the patient was 
healed. That could easily be applied in this situation. From the 
little I had gotten from Hotaru I had the dark suspicion that if 
events hadn&#39;t unfolded as they did, everything would have taken a much 
more bitter end. I honestly wasn&#39;t sure if normal medical means could 
have dealt with what had been required.
	Of course, despite the fact that nobody died in the attacks not 
everything was well. Oh no, not at all. If anything the swiftness and 
destructive force with which our mysterious enemy had made her move 
was frightening and had hammered the point home to everyone who still 
doubted the actual degree of danger we were facing here. Haruka and 
Michiru were rather... shaken from their experience of the battle and 
that alone was frightening enough. There hadn&#39;t been any follow up yet 
but now that part of the ancient seal had already been broken it was - 
as Hotaru put it - just a matter of time now. Usagi had called a 
meeting immediately as soon as everyone - mostly Minako - was 
sufficiently recovered. The situation indeed had become dire.
	Makoto still hadn&#39;t shown up since leaving the hospital 
yesterday. Part of me wanted to bash her one over the head for being 
so stupid. I wouldn&#39;t say that I quite understood all the 
complications involved in the strange three-way relationship formed 
between Minako, Hotaru and her but from what I&#39;ve seen there had 
always been honest affection between the three of them and now that 
our leader had found her old cheerfulness again - a trait I relished 
in, believe me - I doubted that Makoto had anything to worry about. 
Then again, I could also understand how she was feeling. Well, at 
least a part of it. Everything she couldn&#39;t physically grasp and deal 
with had always been hard on her. She was a lot like me in that 
regard. I tended to shy away from outward expressions of emotion. 
Anything irrational, anything I couldn&#39;t rely on to solve with my head 
was hard for me to grasp. And Makoto compared to me tended to rather 
express herself with an irrational burst of temper rather than retreat 
into herself.
	I still thought she was being stupid for making those two woman 
who obviously DID love her in a situation like this now. I wasn&#39;t too 
concerned though. As easy as Makoto was to lose her cool when things 
got to stressful - and they had hit their maximum limit quite awhile 
back, that I was sure of - she also was one to easily catch herself 
again, finding back on the right path. Maybe that was why Minako 
didn&#39;t seem overly concerned, having known the other woman longer than 
Hotaru who might have spent a good year living with her but who - I 
could tell with a professional view - was starting to really let all 
that had happened in the last days sink in. I had been amazed at how 
long she seemed to be able to hold her calm in the middle of such an 
emotional chaos, Saturn or not.
	&quot;Are we coming at a bad moment?&quot; I glanced up at the voice 
seeing three girls had entered the room from whom two were at least 
somewhat familiar although we hadn&#39;t gotten much of a chance to talk 
to. Kinomoto Sakura and Daidouji Tomoyo. The other girl had long 
purple hair and green eyes and didn&#39;t spark any familiarity. I 
remembered what I&#39;ve heard from Hotaru, however, and concluded this 
had to be the one that had been Pandora&#39;s primary target in this 
weekend&#39;s attacks. The third seal child... or former one now.
	&quot;We wanted to see how Pei... I am sorry, I mean Aino-san is 
doing,&quot; Sakura asked politely. &quot;We would have come by earlier but we 
had our own experience to recover from.&quot;
	I smiled slightly. One even remotely sensitive could see the... 
harmony surrounding the three and I strongly supposed that even those 
not sensitive were hard-pressed not to pick up on the connection 
between them. Here was the glaring contrast to Minako, Hotaru and 
Makoto&#39;s situation. &quot;I am sure Minako would like to see you... again.&quot; 
I added the last bit with a bit of reluctance but not really conveying 
a negative tone. I wasn&#39;t sure what to think of it yet. Our leader did 
seem changed, that was hard to ignore, and I believed there would be a 
lot more instances to make that clear to anyone in the near future. 
However, I couldn&#39;t see any fault in that change. She had rediscovered 
her cheerful side and was a lot more open now emotionally as she 
hadn&#39;t been especially in the last months. I didn&#39;t want to sound 
insulting but lately her mood had been rather... unbearable.
	&quot;That is good to hear. Is it safe to assume then that everyone 
is in good health? You have to know our source of information could be 
considered... unreliable at times,&quot; Tomoyo wanted to know in a 
perfectly neutral manner that didn&#39;t really went along with the last 
statement.
	I put down my now empty cup and headed out of the room, 
motioning the three to follow me. &quot;Oh, everything is fine, considering 
the circumstances of course.&quot; No one commented, so I took the silence 
as a form of agreement. As outwardly relaxed as the three seemed I had 
seen many signs of concern in the last years to just take their 
appearance as it seemed on first glance.
	I lead the three girls through the corridors over to Minako&#39;s 
room, answering the one or other question. Minako indeed had made a 
remarkable recovery. Not even a scar was left from the wound she had 
suffered and her energy reserves had filled up rapidly once she had 
regained conscious. More so than should even be possible for a Senshi 
and recently pregnant woman for that matter. I doubted she needed to 
stay here longer than a couple of days. Considering the ordeal she had 
been through, including giving birth to a magical child under the 
worst of circumstances... I would have termed it a miracle if I had 
not been a Senshi for so long already. Now, it was only coming damn 
close to it.
	Opening the door a deep frown crept over my face as I noticed 
the empty state of Minako&#39;s room...

******************************

(Hotaru)
I found her not very far away from the hospital at one of the older 
schools in Minato-ku. It wasn&#39;t that much trouble to locate her now 
with a reactivated bond. There were mixed feelings inside of me when I 
came back from running some errands and found Minako gone. On one hand 
I wasn&#39;t all too concerned. She had made a remarkable recovery so far, 
even Ami had attested to that, but after all that happened I couldn&#39;t 
quell the momentary rise of panic. That maybe something had come up 
again, something had happened, either personal like some badly thought 
through reaction from my other mate or maybe that Pandora... Both were 
ridiculous of course. Firstly, Minako seemed to be more in harmony 
with her inner self than she had ever been before. And secondly, the 
amount of energy Pandora had invested in the recent attack and the 
destruction of one part of the seal had to be too great for a new 
attack already. If the latter had been the case, the situation would 
have been even more frightening.
	Everyone was in a state of nervous anxiety and the attack had 
only multiplied these feelings to a cosmic degree, especially within 
those who hadn&#39;t even taken a very active role. Those who did now 
truly began to realize the exact danger that we were all in and what a 
true war with this ancient devil would most likely entail. My nerves 
had been worn rather thin to. The emotional ups and downs were gnawing 
on my resolve. I was worried about the uncertainty of the future, 
about Makoto, about facing all this a second time. I was worried about 
so many things.
	The school area was deserted, the short vacation period between 
end of the old and start of the new term had emptied the halls, 
classrooms and sport fields. Minako sat on one of the benches in the 
largest yard with her gaze directed skyward. The glow of the slowly 
setting sun somewhat behind her gave the woman I had loved and did 
love again a kind of angelic beauty. Then again, I was probably 
biased, heavily...
	As I approached silently, Minako tilted her head into my 
direction, a look of apology appearing in her face. &quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t 
mean to run off. Just... I wanted to go look for Mako-chan and sort of 
got sidetracked...&quot; She smiled sheepishly and after a time of being at 
the receiving end of a stern look the smile fell into a frown... or 
like a pout. &quot;Now, don&#39;t give me that look. You know I&#39;m not gonna run 
off on you. Especially now.&quot;
	&quot;That didn&#39;t stop you before,&quot; I commented dryly. The moment the 
words were out I felt like slapping myself. It was too late to take 
them back, however, and I felt regret at the pained expression 
crossing the other&#39;s features.
	Eventually Minako glanced away with a heavy sigh of resignation. 
&quot;You are right, I suppose. You know me though, never sitting still.&quot; 
This time I answered the small smile with one of my own. The 
adventurous and energetic streak was one of the many things that her 
and Peitho had in common, one of the many things that attracted me so 
much to her, in this and the first cycle. Peitho had rarely been able 
to sit still for more than a few minutes. And she HATED lying in bed 
after acquiring some serious wounds in battle that made resting a 
necessity. She had been quite unbearable at such times.
	I shook my head with a soft laugh as I stepped closer, joining 
her on the bench. &quot;What am I going to do with you, huh?&quot;
	Much to my disappointed the blonde woman got up just as I sat 
down and walked away a couple of meters. &quot;So,&quot; I asked tentatively, 
&quot;why are you... here?&quot;
	Minako didn&#39;t answer immediately but when she did her voice had 
taken on a faraway quality. &quot;Memories. This used to be my Junior High 
School. It was here where I first became a Senshi in this time. And I 
think it was here where the delusions begun.&quot; I kept silent, sensing 
that the other needed to talk about this. Not surprisingly a lot of 
dark memories had to have been dragged up by the Seeker&#39;s attack. Yes, 
there was a noticeable positive change as a consequences but I would 
have preferred the circumstances to be less painful, less haunting.
	&quot;I had my first really big crush back then, I really thought I 
was in love, maybe I was. Higashi... He turned out to be an enemy. And 
afterwards the chain continued, many I had been interested in turned 
out to be either hostile or already taken. I became scared, scared of 
rejection and heartbreak, fleeing into my role as Sailor V and later 
on Venus... Because as a Senshi I needn&#39;t have to worry about failure. 
I tried to balance things back then. The excitement and popularity as 
a super heroine and the normal life as Minako... My Senshi aspect 
slowly began to tip that balance. In the end duty always destroyed any 
kind of normal life. I had begun thinking that Aino Minako was really 
just a cover, that I never truly could be that person.&quot;
	&quot;But you are her,&quot; I stated quietly, looking up to meet deep 
blue eyes lost in past emotions.
	&quot;I know, I know now. But back then, I was young. I didn&#39;t really 
understand what I do now. And I was scared, scared to get hurt. I had 
been so full of hopes back then, the dreams of a young teenager of the 
one true love. I had always sought perfection, trying to find that one 
person that was right to me. However, I did all this on my own, never 
had I anyone chasing after me, but that was okay... or so I thought. 
In the end I only set myself up for a great deal of disappointment.&quot;
	&quot;Minako,&quot; I moved to stand up again and took a tentative step 
towards her. The other woman continued to speak but held my gaze. 
&quot;This thing, exposed to so much darkness of one&#39;s own soul all at 
once, it can destroy you. For me though, I think I learned a great 
deal about myself and now I know, know again and maybe even better 
than before that love is something that you cannot force. It will come 
to you in its own time. What you have to do is see and accept then it 
comes.&quot; She reached behind her head and untied her trademark red 
ribbon, letting the hair fall down fully unrestrained now. &quot;I&#39;m very 
lucky being allowed a second chance.&quot;
	I blinked in puzzlement as Minako closed the distance between us 
and slipped around me. Tugging at one hand she pulled me back to the 
bench and began carefully braiding my hair. Not quite knowing what was 
going on, I couldn&#39;t help but close my eyes at the soft feeling of 
skilled fingers working through long black strands. I had played with 
the thought of cutting it shorter again, just like when I was younger 
but now was glad that I didn&#39;t.
	&quot;There,&quot; Minako&#39;s voice brought me out of my short trance and I 
reached up to notice that my mate had created an impromptu pigtail 
and, which was the greatest surprise, had bound it together with the 
red ribbon. I looked up at her questioningly as she stepped around to 
look me over from the front. &quot;A fresh start,&quot; was all Minako said with 
a hopeful smile that was positively infatuating.
	I took her offered hand, getting up. &quot;And this time forever,&quot; I 
confirmed with conviction.
	Minako nodded firmly. &quot;Forever.&quot;
	We smiled at each other and then I leaned forward, standing on 
my toes slightly to kiss the other woman, feeling and relishing that 
amazing mix of old and new emotions. Yet, there also was still 
something missing, something unresolved, and that something was 
weighting heavily on both of us. &quot;What about Mako-chan? I understand 
she needs some time but I&#39;m starting to worry...&quot; The other Senshi had 
become too important to me, to both of us. She was now part of our 
connection, of the family we had founded. If anything the seed of new 
life preserved and fully forming somewhere in Earth&#39;s orbit right now 
was the best proof. As hard as these last months were, as much denials 
as had been uttered in the course of managing the unexpected 
pregnancy... All this had also brought us closer together, to a point 
where neither could deny the importance of the other two in their 
life.
	&quot;Let me find her. I think I&#39;ll manage and maybe it&#39;s better that 
I go speak to her. Why don&#39;t you go on ahead and reassure Ami that I&#39;m 
alright. I won&#39;t be long.&quot; Minako lingered with one hand on my cheek, 
waiting for a reply. On one hand I wanted to protest, insist that at 
least we&#39;d go together but on the other I could see the determination, 
could see the need to do this, by herself, as a contribution to our 
relationship. And that relieved me actually. I had invested so much 
energy into keeping things together over the last month, I pretty much 
welcomed Minako taking charge like this. Besides that, Makoto seemed 
to have made up her mind that eventually all I wanted was Minako, 
regardless of what I said. She might listen to the blonde.
	&quot;I trust you,&quot; I said finally, my heart warming at the glow in 
the other woman&#39;s face at the words. &quot;Just don&#39;t take too long or I 
come and hunt you both down. And then, you&#39;ll really be sorry,&quot; I 
added playfully.
	Minako grinned. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t dare risking that but I&#39;ll be sure 
to relate the threat to Mako-chan.&quot;

******************************

(Minako)
Well, one could get used to all the rediscovered abilities. I thought 
I had been good before. After all, Artemis had put me through one hell 
of a training. I was pretty sure that none of the others had worked so 
hard as I had. That had been necessary of course since I had been the 
first to awaken in this time and therefore the only one to fight the 
forces of evil, not to mention that most of my Senshi traits had still 
been locked. Now though the abilities I had gained through my 
partner&#39;s training just seemed like basics. It had been a rather easy 
task to draw upon the chi and mana around me to replenish my drained 
supplies. I felt as refreshed as if I had slept a week, ready to 
bounce of the walls... in the literal sense.
	And thus locating Makoto was... simple. Hotaru could have done 
it but I think she chose not to pry too deeply, afraid to initiate 
another negative reaction. I had respected our missing mate&#39;s privacy 
and need to collect herself as well but the waiting was getting onto 
Hotaru&#39;s nerves. This needed to finally find a conclusion. And the 
only conclusion I would allow was a positive one. That is what deep 
down all of us wanted. I could feel it, clear as the day. There was no 
doubt about it.
	Entering a rather deserted Crown Fruit Parlor I smiled 
pleasantly at Unazuki who looked up to see me enter, only to glance 
towards a table in the far corner. I didn&#39;t need to look to know who 
was where. Giving the younger Furuhata a nod, I made my way over to 
the alcove. There were only three other customers left and it looked 
like they weren&#39;t going to stay long either. Enough privacy then.
	&quot;Are you going to sit here all day?&quot; I asked without preamble, 
making the brunette jump slightly.
	Apart from that initial reaction though no other followed, just 
a weary sigh. &quot;Minako,&quot; Makoto said evenly and waved for me to join 
her. I did so, sitting down opposite of her, somewhat prepared for a 
long hard talk. Most of this doubt in the other woman I had been 
responsible for. My inability to let myself be loved had hurt both 
Hotaru and her. I needed to put that right.
	&quot;Makoto,&quot; I replied in the same manner but was pleasantly 
surprised that the brunette was not averting her gaze, instead facing 
my own directly, still confused but also guilty, apologetic... 
vulnerable. &quot;Hotaru is worried about you,&quot; I stated, gauging a 
reaction and finding her face falling. &quot;But you know that already.&quot; 
With one hand I reached out to put it other Makoto&#39;s who was listless 
holding her empty glass and continued softly, &quot;I was worried too.&quot;
	&quot;I know. Are you alright?&quot; Worry momentarily overshadowed every 
other emotion in her green eyes.
	&quot;Just peachy,&quot; I answered easily trying to reassure the other 
woman.
	Silence for a moment. &quot;I was an ass, wasn&#39;t I?&quot;
	A part of me wanted to protest but somehow I knew that wasn&#39;t 
what the other woman wanted to hear. &quot;Yes, you were. A pretty big one 
actually.&quot; I tried to look stern, the attempt, however, failed 
miserable at the sight of sad green eyes. I grinned in attempt to 
cheer her up. &quot;You seem to be doing better though.&quot;
	Makoto smiled shyly in return. &quot;I do. I had some time to think 
and realized it was pretty stupid to run from something as wonderful 
as what you guys were offering.&quot;
	I searched my long time friend&#39;s eyes for several moments, 
seeing the realization of truth there and a new calmness that had 
definitely been lacking the previous day from what Hotaru had told me. 
It wasn&#39;t like either of us couldn&#39;t understand the reaction. Yet, I 
was wondering about details nonetheless. &quot;What made you do it then?&quot;
	The reason why I hadn&#39;t persuaded the search earlier - and I 
could have if I really wanted to - was because I had gotten to know 
the real Makoto pretty good. Not just in the last months. The basis 
had been made during those days during a crisis and in between the 
last and the next. I had seen a part of the loneliness then that had 
been present even back then. Makoto hadn&#39;t even been actively pursuing 
a relationship. Maybe because she didn&#39;t want to, maybe because she 
was already falling for me, I wasn&#39;t quite sure. However, while not as 
forcefully practiced as I had, the self-imposed solitude had been 
cause for much loneliness, whether she wanted to acknowledge that or 
not. I could see that even clearer now, free of my own boundaries and 
with the knowledge and insight acquired through my ordeal. On some 
level I believed she had been just as much afraid to love as I had.
	&quot;I was scared, I guess,&quot; Makoto said after a long while, all but 
confirming my current thoughts. &quot;I was scared and confused. You two, 
you love each other so much. Even when you were shying away from the 
very thought, Hotaru managed to get through to you. I never really 
ever did anything special to verify this, my part in the relationship. 
What you do have is beautiful and I couldn&#39;t... can&#39;t really see how 
you could offer me to be a part of it.&quot;
	I had expected most of that and was already prepared to give an 
answer, seeing that the direct approach probably was the best right 
now. &quot;So, you want a reason to believe that you belong with us? Do you 
really need one?&quot; Makoto nodded slowly, a note of hesitation in her 
demeanor but also a pleading look in her eyes. She needed to hear 
this. More for her head than for her heart because her heart already 
knew the answer.
	&quot;If you really want an answer,&quot; I began, making sure to capture 
the emerald eyes of the other woman in a look that could have 
paralyzed a Youma. &quot;Then there is a fairly simple one that you could 
have come up with by yourself.&quot; Dropping my voice to a deeply serious 
level, I continued, &quot;Our daughter. Yes, I can see in your eyes that 
you no longer deny this truth. She is your daughter as well, 
regardless of what you might think of her current state - and believe 
me neither Hotaru or I am HAPPY about that. But she IS our daughter. 
Hotaru, mine AND yours. Do you honestly think you can just run away 
from that responsibility? A child needs their mother. And if it has 
three... duh, it needs all three of them. Simple as that.&quot; The taller 
woman flinched visibly at the realization of the truth in this simple 
fact. &quot;But don&#39;t think you can quote me now because that is not the 
only thing why we want to have you with us.&quot;
	&quot;That answer is even more simple,&quot; a new voice intruded and I 
wasn&#39;t even startled like the other woman. I had sensed Hotaru 
approach for a couple of minutes now and wasn&#39;t really surprised 
either that she couldn&#39;t just stay at the hospital and wait as I had 
asked her to. All that she did was politely give me a head start. I 
grinned knowingly and received a sheepish one in kind. The 
black-haired girl slipped next to Makoto and proceeded to put her hand 
above our still joined ones, drawing the brunette&#39;s attention to her. 
&quot;We want you with us because we love you, because you are a part of 
our family.&quot;
	I could sense the small protest and quickly cut in before Makoto 
even could open her mouth. &quot;You probably think that we already have 
each other and since we had been together millennia ago we don&#39;t 
possibly need anyone else, that we CAN&#39;T fall in love with someone 
else. That isn&#39;t correct though. Love isn&#39;t a universal concept 
repeating itself in every life cycle in the same manner. This isn&#39;t 
how love works. Why do you think I can say now that I love Hotaru? Not 
because I remember Hotaru as Phoebe and me as Peitho now. That&#39;s part 
of it but not everything. You fall in love in every life anew. 
Sometimes soul mates spent lifetimes being close friends, distant 
familiars or not even knowing each other and they still fall in love. 
Just because we can remember the person we were meant for doesn&#39;t mean 
that we can&#39;t love someone else. Ask Usagi and Mamoru. They didn&#39;t 
just fall in love because they had been in a previous life. They CHOSE 
love each other, just as I CHOSE to love Hotaru again, just as I CHOSE 
to love you for the person you are, not because whether or not we had 
been together in a previous life cycle.&quot;
	Makoto looked positively thunderstruck with the honest and 
convincing logic and I had to suppress a smirk in satisfaction, 
realizing that I hadn&#39;t lost my touch at all. Somehow it seemed I had 
found just the right words. Hotaru smiled at me fondly before turning 
back to Makoto. &quot;Don&#39;t ask so much questions, Mako-chan. Feel, feel 
and tell us then that you don&#39;t want to be with us.&quot;
	There wasn&#39;t even a pause of hesitation before the taller woman 
shook her head gently, before she put her other hand over Hotaru&#39;s. &quot;I 
can&#39;t do that. It&#39;s impossible now. I&#39;ve already fallen in love with 
both of you. There is no going back anymore.&quot;
	&quot;Then don&#39;t hesitate,&quot; I said, trying to look at both woman at 
once. Those amazing souls that had guided me through the chaos of the 
last months and had stood by my side regardless of my 
unresponsiveness. Their own relationship had developed and deepened 
because of that. Now there was true harmony between us, the last 
doubts having been washed away.
	&quot;Let us be a family our daughter will be proud of. Our daughter 
that WILL walk this planet with us soon, in our peaceful kingdom that 
we WILL establish for her and everyone else. Together.&quot;
	&quot;Together,&quot; I repeated in confirmation.
	Makoto hesitated just a while longer before the last traces of 
worry and confusion were washed away by the overwhelming sensation of 
harmony. &quot;Together,&quot; she agreed.

******************************

(Sakura)
I had settled outside in the yard of the Daidouji mansion watching the 
sun sink slowly behind the horizon. My eyes were closed and my body 
relaxed, my senses extended to feel the flows of life around me. The 
harmony I could feel not only around us but also and especially in 
myself was beautiful. This was a new sensation, completely different 
what it had felt like as Lina. Back then it would have taken my body 
longer to readjust and I had more or less lost the ability to cast any 
positive-charged mana at all. Now though, now I had learned to truly 
balance the powers at my command, to achieve a state of mind that was 
harmony and not preference. I knew now the power of Creation, the 
opposite of Void, I had channeled it already, together with Tomoyo 
four years ago. Now, I just needed to properly manage to balance it in 
the heat of battle, composed in a spell... That wasn&#39;t so easy and 
would take time. Time we didn&#39;t exactly have.
	I smiled, picking up the soft, clear vibration in the mana flow. 
The joyful tingle. The meeting of souls in equal harmony. They were 
alright now, differences put aside. A moment of peace had settled over 
the unsteady, anxious echo the planet was sending out for several 
months now, drawing from the positive feedback of another sealed 
union. A momentary respite, I knew, not to last long, but nonetheless 
a safe haven, a ray of hope to draw strength from before facing the 
darkness ahead. Just like us they had pulled through despite all which 
Pandora had tried in order to destroy us prematurely.
	I pulled back from my senses, out of the connection with the ley 
lines around us, before it became too overwhelming and consuming. This 
had become a bit of a ritual, a ritual where I could center myself, 
remind myself of that which what I had once been and now was.
	&quot;You took awhile,&quot; I stated, not turning around to face the 
other presence that I had felt approaching for awhile... mostly to 
hide the knowing grin.
	&quot;There was much to talk about,&quot; the soft answer came and I 
turned around, raising an eyebrow at the young woman, judging by 
appearance at least. &quot;Well,&quot; a slight blush crept into Persephone&#39;s 
face, &quot;among other things.&quot;
	The smirk deepened. &quot;I bet. And believe me the feeling is 
mutual. Not just for us but for a lot of other people these days, it 
would appear.&quot; The lights in this city were strong and numerous, they 
shone even against the fast approaching night wishing to swallow them. 
It gave me hope. So many strong lights, more so than last time. Maybe 
we would stand a chance after all... No, we did stand a chance. Hope 
was never to be lost because losing hope meant losing everything. 
Serenity had taught us that and I had experienced it myself time and 
again, in this and the previous life.
	&quot;Their bonds will be tested,&quot; the green-haired Senshi spoke 
quietly, as if sensing my thoughts. &quot;And their strength may as well be 
our greatest weapon. I hope it will be enough.&quot; The last sentence was 
spoken very quietly, lined by deep concern from someone who probably 
knew our enemy best.
	It had come as a thorough surprise to me when I finally had 
gotten Persephone to explain how she ended up in the form of the Time 
card. My last memory of the Time Guardian had been a bitter one, the 
memory of an unavoidable sacrifice because only that sacrifice managed 
to give us a chance at sealing Pandora altogether in the first place. 
Instead of death though, somehow her very soul had been bound to the 
Feared One&#39;s cage and she had become something like its guardian. No, 
more like a watcher since there was little influence she had and that 
little influence had been taken away more and more. However, it had 
been that influence that had enable to save Lisa from Pandora&#39;s grasp. 
That fleeting connection.
	&quot;Can you tell how stronger Pandora has become?&quot; I asked 
curiously, the question forcing itself into my mind at her comment.
	&quot;All that I can tell is that whatever is driving her, that 
strange power that we could never quite grasp, it&#39;s gotten even 
stronger, confined inside the prison it has consumed her totally. So 
yes, once she has broken the rest of the seal, her control will be 
near absolute.&quot; Dark green eyes turned away to gaze out onto the city 
but actually I had the feeling they were somewhere completely 
different right now.
	The words of the Senshi were not really helping to soothe my 
nerves, reminding me that it wouldn&#39;t take our arch nemesis long to 
make her next move and both of us knew exactly who her next target 
would be.
	Pandora was clever, she would surely realize that with two 
thirds of her power still restrained she could not possibly hope to 
target me. That left only one option. I shuddered at the thought and 
clenched my eyes shut against the helplessness welling up from deep 
inside of me. Logical I knew there was nothing more that could be done 
than to be on our guard and prepare ourselves for the inevitable but 
that helplessness, that knowledge to be able to do a thing to prevent 
that beast from going after... She had already hurt one of the two I 
loved beyond anything else. And if...
	&quot;Arigato,&quot; I said quietly, catching dark green eyes turning 
towards me and showing unrestrained exactly how thankful I was of the 
offer that had been made. I could have set her free now, released the 
soul from the card but Persephone had pointed out that maybe we could 
not prevent Pandora from breaking the seal but with the feeble 
connection she had, she might at least be able to protect the 
remaining seal children&#39;s lives from Pandora&#39;s grasp. Just as she had 
done for Lisa. I was eternally grateful for that offer, especially 
knowing that staying like this was cutting the time she could spent 
with her own significant other drastically short. This physical form 
now was merely a temporary one.
	Persephone nodded, face solemn. &quot;We cannot have a repeat of last 
time. So much tragedy... We cannot afford such an outcome again.&quot; Her 
features softened. &quot;I won&#39;t let anything happen to her, I promise.&quot; I 
clang to those words desperately. The agony of seeing the experience 
Lisa had undergone had been enough already. My heart was twisted at 
the mere thought of picturing Tomoyo put through a similar one. And 
now that the Feared One&#39;s power was set free partially already, there 
was no telling what she could and would do and if the guardian&#39;s words 
could really be reliable. I didn&#39;t question their sincerity, that 
Persephone really would do everything in her power, but I wasn&#39;t quite 
sure if that everything would be enough.&quot;You&#39;d better get some rest, 
we are going to meet with the rest tomorrow.&quot; I tried to smile but it 
failed miserably, all that I managed was a dry chuckle. &quot;War council.&quot; 
While we had not met with our quarries at the hospital this afternoon 
Mizuno-san had told us that their princess wished a meeting with ALL 
of us. Frankly I had to agree. This was long overdue. The war had 
begun and there was no point in going separated ways anymore. Pandora 
had shown us that that tactic had horribly backfired.
	Persephone nodded quietly, locking her gaze with mine in a 
concerned and adamant look. &quot;You should get some rest as well. Don&#39;t 
muse too long on what might come. You have something to be treasured 
right now.&quot; And with that the Senshi&#39;s body shimmered and then 
disintegrated into green-purple light, reforming into the Time card 
and flying back to my outstretched hand. With a thought I transferred 
her back to the book so that she could recharge.
	My mind drifted for a moment as I stood outside alone. I knew, 
of course, that Persephone was right. It would do no good to get 
depressed about something that hadn&#39;t yet happened. All that did was 
draining away my own hope that maybe somehow things could be 
different, that we would succeed, truly succeed at which that only had 
been a temporary, bittersweet victory. I needed to believe... And yet 
I had been overwhelmed once again by the reminder of how many people 
dear to me I had seen hurt directly or indirectly by this conflict and 
all that was connected to it. How could I ignore this?
	A small smile slipped onto my face, catching the sound of nearly 
silent footfalls, announcing the other&#39;s presence which immediately 
helped to soothe my spirit quite a bit, the love connecting us easily 
drowning out any negative thoughts.

******************************

(Tomoyo)
Ever since Sakura had become a regular guest the mansion had never 
been quite the same again. Before it always had a kind of lonely, 
melancholic feel, probably a mirror reflection of Okaasan&#39;s mood and 
lonely heart. I could understand really. Sakura presence had not only 
brightened up my but both of our lives and Okaasan seemed to cling 
somewhat to my happiness. I remembered fondly the attention lavished 
onto Sakura by an excited Sonomi when she learned we had started to 
date...
	In time Sakura had become not just something like a permanent 
guest but an actual occupant, and that alone did miracles to the Wa of 
the house and those living there. Okaasan had even begun to date again 
lately - even though I was not supposed to know that - which immensely 
relieved my heavy heart which was always saddened at the thought of 
her loneliness while constantly watching Sakura and myself. She didn&#39;t 
seem to mind though.
	&quot;Your mother is pretty cool,&quot; Lisa commented from her place on 
the spacious couch. For someone who had been thoroughly impressed by 
the mansion upon arriving she had taken to its comforts rather 
quickly. Not that I could blame her. Before Sakura I had taken all of 
this for granted mostly, the luxury was only really made one when I 
could share it with the one I loved. Well, now there were two of 
them...
	I finished preparing the small table setting for the three of 
us. Dinner should be just about ready. It had become a habit somewhat 
that I would go and set the table for Sakura and me over the last 
years. Sure, we had maids for that, but I wasn&#39;t that stuck-up or so I 
believed and besides, I liked to do something normal for my special 
girlfriend, girlfriends now. I glanced over at Lisa, an affectionate 
smile on my face. This was all so new, and also so familiar.
	&quot;Yes, she is the best. But beware, once she takes to someone 
positively or negatively, you&#39;ll get the full program,&quot; I chuckled 
quoting Sakura&#39;s analysis of Daidouji Sonomi from the beginning of our 
relationship. It had been a huge relief to see that Okaasan instantly 
seemed to like Lisa and accept her with an enthusiasm that nearly 
rivaled the one she usually directed at Sakura. I caught the 
purple-haired girl wincing, obviously remembering the crushing hug... 
I couldn&#39;t help but grin.
	I slowly walked over to my girlfriend, that still sounded... no, 
not weird, more new, fresh and... I couldn&#39;t deny feeling a little 
giddy. It was as I said to Lisa&#39;s grandmother. Like falling in love 
all over again. There was an air of instant understanding and kinship 
between us, creating a relaxed state that others in our situation 
would have needed a long time to achieve.
	&quot;Yes, I noticed,&quot; Lisa admitted softly, reaching out with one 
hand. I took it and let myself fall on the couch, finding it amazingly 
easy to rest my head against the other girl&#39;s shoulder. I closed my 
eyes, breathing in the sweet scent on the other&#39;s hair, momentarily 
losing myself in the moment. &quot;Tomoyo,&quot; Lisa whispered softly, gentle 
fingers threading through my own hair and drawing a sigh from my lips. 
&quot;This is nice.&quot;
	&quot;Mmh hmm...&quot; I murmured, blissfully forgetting anything else 
around us for the moment, relishing in the amazing sensation. Our 
souls were in synch. Sounded cheesy but I could kind of feel it. While 
being sort of pulled together by circumstances, through the mutual 
love for another in this and the previous life, in both times that 
hadn&#39;t changed at all the fact that an attraction had instantly 
developed, two people taking to each other quickly and finding it easy 
to deepen this attraction over the boundaries of platonic friendship.
	&quot;I&#39;m so lucky,&quot; Lisa commented after a period of serene silence. 
I lifted my head and tilted it slightly to peer at the other girl 
curiously. Wordlessly Lisa leaned forward the short distance to plant 
a short kiss on my lips. Soft, warm, chaste but definitely beautiful. 
The hand in the hair had reached the side of my face lingering there. 
&quot;I&#39;ve been given a family again,&quot; Lisa clarified and I could see a bit 
of haunting memory quickly overshadowed by the sparkle of happiness 
her words accompanied.
	&quot;Lisa-chan,&quot; my voice broke slightly, feeling the overwhelming 
need to take away the other&#39;s sadness as I had done so often for 
Sakura. Life had been hard on the gentle girl next to me. She had lost 
both of her parents, had to watch it helplessly actually. At least 
Sakura and I had family left to cherish... Not saying a word I 
enveloped the miko in a reassuring embrace, stroking the others hair 
and back. &quot;It is and we are,&quot; I agreed seriously, &quot;Your family, I 
mean. Always.&quot;
	&quot;Arigato,&quot; Lisa mumbled, not saying anything else but letting 
the closeness of our bodies and the caress of our souls speak what 
words could not express. I could feel the sadness being drained from 
her and leaned in for another kiss to seal the moment. This one was 
much more passionate and I had to restrain myself from not making any 
bolder moves, vivid images of the result all too present in my mind. 
Pleasant images, mind you, but I think even if I had taken a liking to 
Sakura&#39;s... sometimes kinky inspirations, I would be mortified being 
caught in the act by one of the maids coming in to announce dinner was 
ready.
	We pulled apart eventually but with clear reluctance. Lisa 
groaned slightly, &quot;Kami, Tomoyo, where did you learn to...&quot; she 
trailed of, voice slightly husky.
	I blushed a little, realizing the effect I had... well, alright, 
voluntary produced. &quot;Practice,&quot; I replied with a mischievous and 
promising smile, &quot;Lots of practice.&quot; Lisa giggled softly at my 
response and expression... before nuzzling my neck, making me squeal 
in surprise and a great bit of... excitement.
	I glanced down at green eyes staring upwards innocently. Right, 
innocently. I think she enjoyed this a little too much. Then again, I 
wasn&#39;t one to complain. The events of the weekend had been hectic and 
we were all more than aware that this had only just begun. Who knew 
how much time we would have for... fun activities in the coming 
months. I had always been good in reading people and Lisa had struck 
me instantly as kind of... lost on our first meeting. I knew now that 
all her life she had searched for her place in this world, traveling 
around but never finding answers to what drove her. Now, after finding 
us, she seemed to cling to that answer with an almost desperate 
ferocity.
	Caressing Lisa&#39;s face, I made sure she saw how serious I was 
when speaking the next words, &quot;We are not going to go anywhere. We 
love you and wouldn&#39;t want to have you anywhere else.&quot; The full smile 
spreading about the other girl&#39;s lips was quickly ascending to get a 
place right next to Sakura&#39;s. The joy and gratefulness radiating from 
her was infatuating.
	&quot;You are an amazing person. A bit like Lia-chan when she was 
older but with your own charm,&quot; Lisa commented with an adoring look 
that made me quiver slightly, &quot;I can see why Sakura is so madly in 
love with you, and I can&#39;t help but feel that I love you too. Not just 
because you are Amelia&#39;s reincarnation but for the person you are now 
as well.&quot; The words were warming. I think it was the first time we 
really said the three letter phrase and it definitely suited the mood, 
deepening, strengthening that which had already developed between us.
	The moment was broken though as I felt a sharp pang of sadness 
and guilt coming over our link. It wasn&#39;t from Lisa though which only 
left one answer. I glanced back at the purple-haired miko after 
momentarily looking towards the door. Sakura had gone out for a moment 
to perform her daily ritual. But now she didn&#39;t seem as relaxed as she 
usually was as a result of that.
	&quot;Let me go. I think I know what&#39;s on her mind,&quot; Lisa said 
softly, rising from the couch. For a moment I played with the thought 
of following but instead settled back with a trusting smile directed 
at my other mate. Lisa smiled back gratefully and with a knowing smirk 
added, &quot;I&#39;ll be sure to get her back inside so that we can finish 
dinner and direct our attention towards... other things.&quot; I laughed at 
the wink she gave me before slipping out of the room.
	Yes, I was definitely in love again. Not that I had ever stopped 
to be in love with Sakura. We had always managed to keep the love 
between us from weakening or setting into a routine. However, Lisa had 
added a remarkable refreshing element to our relationship, fitting in 
seamlessly. I couldn&#39;t believe I ever doubted this even in the 
slightest. Looking around the room, I felt what I did before. The 
miko&#39;s presence had given the mansion an even stronger feeling of 
vibrant, happy life.
	With a content smile on my lips I got up and headed for the 
kitchen to check when dinner would be ready and afterwards I would see 
if Lisa needed any help in dealing with a moody Sakura. Despite 
trusting her intention and ability, I knew how the genki girl was when 
retreating into herself.

******************************

(Lisa)
I almost didn&#39;t manage to find my way outside again if not for skills 
developed in years of travel that had become necessary exploring the 
occasional ruins or underground chambers... The Daidouji manor surely 
could rival some of them. &#39;Not as big as Saillune palace though&#39;, I 
mused with a wistful smile. We had all changed quite a bit. The core 
of the old personalities was still there but different shades had been 
added. I started to learn all about those changes concerning Sakura 
and Tomoyo, so far I wasn&#39;t disappointed. Both of them were actually a 
lot like Lina and Amelia had been in later years and those had been 
among our most fondly remembered ones.
	I found Sakura standing outside, shoulders tense and radiating a 
troubled aura, not overwhelming but clearly occupying the redhead&#39;s 
mind. It seemed she had sensed my approach and wordlessly leaned back 
into the embrace. As I said to Tomoyo I was pretty sure what was on 
the other girl&#39;s mind right now, remembering the old days when Lina 
used to be just like that, especially after meeting again, several 
years after our first tentative steps towards each other. Steps that 
had been innocent and all too brief, done in na&iuml;ve belief that all 
problems could be overcome by a love that hadn&#39;t even fully developed 
then. And I hadn&#39;t made it easier by running like a scared child.
	&quot;Don&#39;t torture yourself so much. Some things are simply beyond 
our control. It is the understanding of that and our efforts to 
prevail over these events that is really important,&quot; I whispered into 
the other girl&#39;s ear. &quot;Tomoyo and I know that you would never wish or 
let any harm come to any of us and the same goes for us too.&quot;
	Sakura shuddered slightly, the tension only draining a tiny bit. 
&quot;I know. It&#39;s just... Somehow, despite my best intentions, I end up 
hurting those that I care about. I can&#39;t do anything about it and that 
makes me feel so helpless. I never asked to have such an effect on 
everyone...&quot;
	My grip tightened slightly around the petite girl, softly urging 
her to turn around. When she did eventually I stared into magnificent 
golden eyes, a trait that, sharing Tomoyo&#39;s opinion, I found to be 
gorgeous-looking. &quot;But you do and I think you are missing the simple 
fact while maybe, against your will, people get hurt around you, you 
also make them happy. You make us happy and we don&#39;t want to see you 
sad or beating up yourself over some failure you could do little 
about.&quot;
	&quot;How can you say that so easily?&quot; Sakura questioned, voice tiny, 
&quot;After what happened to you, after what I let happen to you. Again. 
Again, I didn&#39;t want to, but I still let you get hurt...&quot;
	&quot;Shh,&quot; I hushed the redhead with a finger, pulling her closer 
and with soothing motions over her back urged one of the mightiest 
mages this world had ever seen to release her pent-up feelings of 
helplessness and frustration about the hardships destiny seemed to 
like throw into her path. &quot;I won&#39;t lie to you,&quot; I said softly, 
continuing to hold Sakura gently but insistent. &quot;It was horrible. I 
was so scared and alone and all I could think about was the unfairness 
of everyone I loved being taken away from me. But do you know what 
made me fight back. You did. You did because one can&#39;t ignore the 
POSITIVE influence on people that you have. Without you I would have 
given up hope completely when Copy Rezo destroyed Sairaag, without you 
seeing Fibrizo resurrect everyone for his own twisted play would 
surely have robbed my sanity. But you&#39;ve always been there somehow, 
you always kept my spirits up.&quot;
	&quot;Syl-chan,&quot; the redhead said quietly. &quot;I don&#39;t want any of you 
to get hurt again. And you know she&#39;s going to come after... And I 
can&#39;t...&quot;
	&quot;You can&#39;t protect everyone, Lina-chan. The world is a harsh 
place. But you have us and we have you and that is the most important 
thing, is it not?&quot; Sakura glanced up and gave the ghost of a nod. I 
frowned. &quot;Now, you can do that better. Show me that smile, I like that 
happy smile of yours.&quot; Which was the truth. For all her good sides 
even Lina&#39;s smile didn&#39;t reach Sakura&#39;s, another thing I could easily 
agree on with my other mate. It made you feel all giddy inside, a 
happy, fluttery feeling created by being the target of something so... 
beautiful.
	The next attempt was better but didn&#39;t quite reach what I had 
aimed for. I sighed. &quot;Sakura, please. Don&#39;t feel guilty over what has 
been. I know you are beating yourself up over not acting faster before 
the attack but tell you what? I believe I should rather blame myself. 
I didn&#39;t listen to my own heart that was telling me to get to you 
right away. I knew deep down something would happen but didn&#39;t act on 
that warning. And now Pandora is going to break free eventually and 
both of you might get hurt in the process...&quot;
	&quot;But that&#39;s not your fault!&quot; Sakura interrupted fiercely, &quot;You 
didn&#39;t...&quot; She trailed off, realization dawning in her eyes. &quot;Oh.&quot;
	I smiled knowingly. &quot;Yes, it was my fault. It feels like its my 
fault, just like it feels to you as if it is your fault for letting me 
get hurt again, just as you feel responsible for maybe not being able 
to protect us properly... Sakura-chan, in the end, it&#39;s Pandora&#39;s 
fault. She is doing all these things and we can only do so much. 
Neither of us is perfect and when you beat yourself up over what you 
can&#39;t change THEN you really won&#39;t change anything.&quot;
	The attempt of a smile deepened, reaching almost what I had 
longed for. &quot;You are...&quot; Sakura hesitated before continuing. &quot;... 
different.&quot;
	&quot;So are you, so is Tomoyo,&quot; I replied, fluently picking up on 
the line of thought that I had given some attention to as well. &quot;But 
that&#39;s okay. We are together, we love each other, and that&#39;s what is 
counting. Nothing else,&quot; I emphasized and to make my point leaned in 
for a kiss, renewing some of the fire inside that Tomoyo had stirred, 
delivering the message not too subtly to the redhead. These had 
probably been the happiest and most fulfilling days of my life 
regardless of the trauma predating it, and I was going to enjoy them. 
I had found those that I was meant to be with and finally I wasn&#39;t 
lonely anymore, I didn&#39;t feel that restlessness urging me onwards most 
of my life. I was home here and I would do everything to keep and 
protect this exhilarating feeling.
	&quot;I am scared,&quot; Sakura said softly after we parted, &quot;I am scared 
to lose you again, both of you...&quot; The haunted look was boring right 
through my heart. I had heard from Tomoyo that Sakura had already seen 
a different future, a future where she did fail everyone, where 
everything had stumbled into oblivion, and now faced with the same 
possibility again, she couldn&#39;t help but remember... and fear.
	&quot;I think we all are,&quot; Tomoyo&#39;s gentle voice chimed in, just 
before she effortlessly slipped an arm around both of us, directing a 
warm but insistent look at the redhead. &quot;But look, we are all still 
here. No one died, everyone survived. And that is because you didn&#39;t 
give up, because you did NOT fail. Had you not won the battle, all of 
us would be dead now. But we aren&#39;t. We are alive and together. And 
it&#39;s going to stay like that. Do you know why?&quot;
	Golden eyes shifted from Tomoyo to me and back again, a tear 
slid down one cheek and was caught by a finger from both Tomoyo and me 
at the same time. Startled we both stopped for a moment before turning 
to smile at each other, and as we turned back were greeted by that 
incredible sunshine smile, adoring eyes trying to take us in 
simultaneously.
	&quot;Because everything will surely be alright.&quot;
	At Tomoyo&#39;s nod I looked at them slightly confused. &quot;It&#39;s 
Sakura&#39;s magic phrase,&quot; the dark-haired girl explained 
matter-of-factly.
	The redhead shook her head vehemently, grasping Tomoyo&#39;s hand 
and then my own, staring intently at both of us. &quot;No. It is OUR magic 
phrase. Because only you give it meaning. Both of you.&quot;

******************************

No visual evidence or indication of the change that this weekend&#39;s 
battles meant for the world and probably the entire universe in the 
long run had been given. Life continued onward normally for everyone 
on Earth. For them, nothing had happened. And even for those select 
few that were aware of the consequences, aware of the first victory 
their enemy had earned, even those had not seen anything around them 
that would show just how drastic the pace, the irritating anxiety and 
helplessness, of the last months had suddenly changed. Not that they 
needed to. Those that had participated in the battles had met 
firsthand the danger - and the seriousness thereof - that awaited. 
Barely none of them doubted anymore that this would very well be the 
hardest battle they had ever fought.
	It was Tuesday morning now. Tsukino Usagi, reborn 
Princess-soon-to-be-Queen - assuming they survived the following 
months - stepped out onto the balcony of her and her husband&#39;s 
apartment, her gaze directed skywards and a deep frown etching into 
the lines of her normally either cheerful or recently more and more 
calm and collected features. Blue eyes were filled with concern which 
strengthened with each moment she did not avert her eyes, with each 
moment that which that her mind processed from the visual feedback did 
not change.
	It wasn&#39;t even six in the morning yet, somewhere around dawn 
actually. But this wasn&#39;t the color of dawn, this wasn&#39;t the light 
blue announcing the rise of the sun, this was more a dark blue and 
purple, the kind to be seen on clear evenings, after the sun had set 
that indicated the coming of the night. Dusk not Dawn. Usagi had the 
sinking feeling that she would not see the sun today, maybe not for a 
very long time...
	&quot;It has begun,&quot; a voice next to her startled the young heir to 
the Silver Millennium out of her motionless state. She glanced to the 
side and was somehow not very surprised to see Sailorpluto standing 
there, her gaze also directed towards the sky. &quot;Pandora is extending 
her power. This is just the beginning. Soon the real war will be 
begin.&quot;
	Usagi was silent for a couple of moments, before she spoke in a 
soft, but firmly inquiring voice, &quot;Do you think we stand a chance?&quot;
	&quot;I cannot say, Your Highness. I dearly wish I could, but that 
assurance I cannot give you because I don&#39;t know it myself.&quot;

******************************

(Minako)
I groaned tiredly, ignoring the distant sound that had ripped me out 
of a content, albeit dreamless sleep, snuggling instinctively closer 
to the warm body next to me, trying to lull my mind back to sleep.
	The ringing sound continued.
	I grumbled something incoherently and menacingly at the 
insistent background sound interrupting my sleep. I envied the other 
two women next to me instantly for being able to totally block it out. 
I wasn&#39;t even sure why or even if I had been woken up because of it. 
Maybe it wasn&#39;t because of it but just simply waking up and then 
noticing the ringing... that still didn&#39;t stop.
	&#39;Didn&#39;t I switch on the answering machine?&#39; my still 
sleep-induced mind wondered and I muttered a few curses while 
carefully extracting myself from the gentle embrace of strong and 
secure arms. I gave the brunette and the smaller dark-haired girl 
curled up behind her a fond look. I really didn&#39;t want to get out of 
bed when I could just stay with two such amazing women... but that 
damn phone was getting on my nerves! I glanced at the digital clock. 
Just a few minutes before eight in the morning! Who the hell would 
call at such an ungodly hour? For a brief moment I wondered if it was 
one of the other Senshi and something had happened but discarded that 
idea immediately. That&#39;s what our private communicators were for.
	Silently slipping into the hallway, I thought back on that offer 
Ami had made to install that new voice phone system they were working 
on at Neo Tomoe Labs. I had shied away, finding it a bit too 
complicated to get used to on first glance. Now I wished I would have 
taken up the offer, could have staid in bed then.
	&quot;Yes, who is it?&quot; I all but snarled into the phone after picking 
up one of the receivers scattered over the manor. If I decided to keep 
that place after the ascension, I would really have to consider 
employing at least a basic permanent staff.
	&quot;Is that you Aino-san? I&#39;m so glad I caught you... Um, I didn&#39;t 
wake you up, did I?&quot;
	At the voice that greeted me a rush of mixed emotions coursed 
through me, most of them negative, and in response my face hardened 
into one of rude annoyance. I wished the speaker on the other end 
could see it. &quot;Oh, Yakamuri-&#39;kun&#39;, of course not. It is not even eight 
in the morning, I was just having a peaceful nap after some very 
hectic days and why would you ever think you WOKE ME UP?&quot; I replied in 
a honey-sweet voice dripping of sarcasm, before it took on an icy 
tone. &quot;What do you want?&quot;
	There was a long period of silence from the other end while I 
tried to get my raging emotions under control. The feedback was 
threatening to leak over the bond and the last I wanted to was for my 
two mates to wake up to find me in a grumpy mood. Too much of that had 
happened between us lately. We had finally found that harmony we&#39;ve 
been searching for. &quot;Well?&quot; I inquired impatiently as after several 
seconds no reply came over the line.
	&quot;Err, look, Mina...&quot;
	&quot;It is Aino-san to you,&quot; I insisted sharply. On a level I knew 
that I was unfair. The other man had not been given much of a choice 
in acting as he had but the way it was done, that&#39;s what had really 
gotten to me.
	&quot;Alright, alright,&quot; he quickly averted. &quot;I know I&#39;ve not been 
handling this issue very well and I&#39;ve got a lot of pressure actually 
from other ends and well...&quot;
	&quot;Get to the point,&quot; I snapped, temper flaring. I had been woken 
up rude from one of the best night&#39;s sleeps I had in ages, especially 
considering that some nightmares ought to be expected after the trauma 
I had been through, torn out of bed, away from my two lovers, and now 
was having a conversation with my ex-boss I could well do without. I 
wasn&#39;t even sure why I hadn&#39;t hung up already.
	&quot;The point is. I, um, heard from someone I know working at the 
hospital that you got out yesterday and well, I was wondering if you 
might consider, as soon as you are sufficiently recovered of 
course...&quot;
	Realization dawned on my sleeping mind and for a moment I was 
actually considering the implied offer but then my resolve hardened 
and I cut in before the man could finish his jumbled explanations. 
&quot;Why I would certainly love to act again,&quot; I stated evenly, 
&quot;Unfortunately I have other responsibilities right now that are of 
much more dire importance. Sayonara, Yakamuri-san.&quot; And with that I 
actually did hang up, cutting of the sputtered reply I could 
distinctly pick up before the receiver was put down.
	For several long moments I stood there with one hand still 
resting on the put down receiver, mind slowly processing what just 
happened. Then, slowly at first but steadily growing, a satisfied 
smirk crept into my face, deepening with an entirely different emotion 
when I felt the embrace from behind, strong arms slipping around my 
upper body and lips nuzzling my neck.
	&quot;Mmh, missed you,&quot; Makoto&#39;s voice drifted into my ear and I 
shuddered slightly from the breath caressing my skin combined with the 
feel of the somewhat possessive hug the taller woman was applying. 
&quot;What was that all about?&quot; the question came albeit I could tell 
getting the answer wasn&#39;t foremost on her mind. Doubts put aside and 
firmly concentrated on a task Makoto was someone who always executed 
that task to perfection, I mused with affection. Not that I would 
complain.
	&quot;Yakamuri-san,&quot; I mumbled, shifting until I could turn around. 
As soon as we were face to face I dove in for a thorough kiss, 
latching my arms around the other woman&#39;s neck. &quot;Morning, love,&quot; I 
whispered after parting and was satisfied with the slight flush. 
&quot;Sorry about slipping out. Believe me I surely didn&#39;t want to and 
probably shouldn&#39;t have.&quot;
	A frown crossed the beautiful features. &quot;What did he want?&quot;
	I snorted derisively. &quot;Apparently got word somehow that I was 
through with my pregnancy somehow, don&#39;t ask me how, didn&#39;t ask. He 
more or less wanted me to come back. To act again... The very nerve of 
it!&quot;
	So, what did you tell him?&quot;
	&quot;I brushed him off. Simple as that,&quot; I replied honestly.
	&quot;Don&#39;t you want to act again? You loved the musicals.&quot; Makoto 
asked softly, the frown not leaving her face.
	For a moment my emotions wavered. Of course, the other woman was 
right in that. I had loved to act. The combination required for a 
musical actress were very high and plenty. You had to be good in 
several different fields and I had spent so much time in working 
myself upwards that being brought down the way I had been was... 
crushing. However, that way was also the very reason why I couldn&#39;t 
even consider the offer. I wouldn&#39;t even have if the situation had not 
been so dire.
	&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter anymore,&quot; I replied quietly after some time 
in which the brunette had patiently waited for me to me speak. &quot;In a 
few months one way or another, everything will be over anyway. And,&quot; 
Now I showed the satisfied smirk from before in order to get my point 
across, &quot;I won&#39;t just go crawling back to them like a dutiful dog that 
has been ignored and treated like a worthless piece of shit after it 
had been ill for sometime. I&#39;m not that shallow.&quot;
	Makoto smiled lovingly and her face was glowing with soft pride. 
&quot;I never said you were. Actually, I&#39;m proud of you for sticking to 
your own values.&quot; One hand reached up to caress the side of my face, 
brushing against the earring there for a moment before resting on my 
skin. I leaned into the touch, remembering the previous evening. My 
gesture with the ribbon had unintentionally started a kind of chain to 
symbolize the new harmony we had found. Makoto had given me her rose 
earring - a heirloom from her mother - and Hotaru had given Makoto the 
pendant she usually wore underneath her clothes which had originally 
been given to her by her grandmother.
	&quot;I am so lucky being allowed to love you and to be loved back,&quot; 
Makoto said, her voice bringing across the sheer astonishment that she 
had just recently allowed to fully settle in.
	Feeling the urge to reassure I pulled the taller woman&#39;s head 
closer and our lips together. The heated pressure was a sure method to 
fully wake me up and I wasn&#39;t quite certain how far this had gone had 
I not been distracted a few seconds into the kiss.
	A low, frustrated and disappointed moan slipped from my mate&#39;s 
lips as I abruptly pulled back. &quot;Mina-chan, what...?&quot; Her voice 
trailed off as she obviously became aware of my startled expression. 
Eyes had widened as they had more accidentally passed by the window on 
the other side of the hallway. At first I hadn&#39;t fully registered, too 
engrossed in the kiss, but then some small part had made me look back. 
Then I had seen the abnormality, the definitely incorrect color of the 
sky, for Peitho a hauntingly familiar phenomena.
	I only distantly felt Makoto&#39;s arms loosening and barely took 
notice of the startled gasp. I took a few steps forward, the other 
woman following hesitantly, approaching the window and confirming that 
I hadn&#39;t been imaging things. &quot;It has started,&quot; I breathed in a shaky 
whisper, unconsciously seeking some small measure of support by 
grasping Makoto&#39;s hand tightly - to a degree of being painful - as 
dark memories from a time long ago were sparked by the scenery 
overshadowed any other thought for a moment. &quot;It has started.&quot;

******************************

(Lisa)
The mood was understandable low in the spacious dining room. All the 
lights were on since outside the sun still hadn&#39;t given any indication 
to rise through the dark sky. The really eerie thing was, I noted with 
another glance out of the window, that no stars were visible as you 
should expect from a clear dusk-like sky. Instead my sensitive eyes 
picked up a very faint glimmer of the deepest kind of crimson the 
color could get away with before tumbling into the pitch-black 
regions. I doubted anyone other than Sakura picked it up since the 
halo effect suggested it could only be seen on a different plane. 
Which probably was a good thing since it had to be expected already 
that the phenomena would call for a lot of public attention.
	&quot;How long is this going to last?&quot; Daidouji Sonomi asked, 
catching and following my gaze. Nothing much had been said when we had 
come down for breakfast. Tomoyo had still been asleep but both Sakura 
and I had been roused by some sort of shift in our surroundings. After 
we had taken a look out of the window going back to sleep or just 
snuggling contently as if nothing had happened was impossible. So we 
had more or less wordlessly joined the older Daidouji in the dining 
room.
	I looked sideways at Sakura for guidance who shrugged her 
shoulders somewhat helplessly. &quot;It is to be expected, Kaasan. This 
kind of is how it was last time. You see, it&#39;s not really a natural 
phenomena and in reality the sun&#39;s still there. It&#39;s like, um... a 
semi-transparent layer that hinders us in physically seeing the sun&#39;s 
light. Or at least that&#39;s what has happened the last time.&quot;
	&quot;But she was at full power then. Wouldn&#39;t something like this 
cost too much energy with your and Amelia&#39;s seal still active?&quot; I 
asked puzzled. I understood a little more about different planes now 
from my spiritual training Babasan and even if it was just an 
illusion, I hardly could believe Pandora would waste the limited 
contact she had now to the outside on something so... useless. If, of 
course, she had become so powerful to extend that much power even in 
her still limited position, then...
	&quot;Um, I heard the news this morning and they were saying this 
thing was limited to the Tokyo area,&quot; one of the maids who had come in 
to bring some more food said.
	Sakura raised her eyebrows and then scowled. &quot;Go figure. She 
knows this is the nexus node now and the most resistance has to be 
expected from this area. Psychological warfare.&quot; She took a listless 
bite from her bread and munched it with even less enthusiasm. 
Understandable actually. The event from this morning had all but 
confirmed Sakura&#39;s dark mood yesterday. I had made some calculations 
in my head and the reaction speed after extending so much energy into 
the initial strike this weekend was frightening. I had hoped we would 
at least get a couple of days more.
	I took another short glance towards the window, then tore my 
eyes away. This wasn&#39;t good. When Pandora had done a similar thing to 
Earth in the original war the villages, towns and cities were 
assaulted with enough fear already, insecurity and leaking knowledge 
of what was going on, coupled with the roaming monsters... Now, in a 
world where anyone on other the side of the planet could see and hear 
instantly what was happening here through the means of various media 
who liked nothing better than to boost the tiniest thing to a 
full-fledged scandal.
	With any luck we would elude mass panic at least a few weeks 
before it got intense.
	&quot;If I may make a suggestion, Daidouji-san?&quot; I spoke up softly.
	The older Daidouji gave me a stern look. &quot;I insist you call me 
Kaasan at least as Sakura does.&quot; The stern look faded into an 
affectionate smile and I felt myself once again amazed at the openness 
of the older woman. If that had been my mother... I quickly cut off 
the thought, the mood was bad enough, I didn&#39;t need to make it worse.
	&quot;Domo arigato, Dai... err, I mean, Okaasama.&quot; Sakura burst out 
into a fit of laughter, earning a cross look from me though I couldn&#39;t 
hold it very long before I smiled myself, realizing just how much I 
sounded like my past life&#39;s self in her younger years. The excessive 
use of &quot;-sama&quot; had gotten me more than a few weird looks. Then again, 
Lina... &quot;You weren&#39;t complaining last night, Sakura-sama.&quot;
	The reaction was immediate, and adoring. Soon the other girl&#39;s 
face was rather hard to distinguish from her hair... I giggled softly 
at the mortified expression on my lover&#39;s face and the frantically 
waving motions she was performing with her hands.
	&quot;Is there something I need to know here?&quot; the older woman asked 
casually but with a grin that was hard to describe as innocent or 
oblivious. I mean, Sakura and Tomoyo had been together for four years 
and had started to... actively pursue their relationship around four 
years ago. The house was big and sound-proof spells were nice but...
	&quot;There is a reason why your daughter isn&#39;t up yet. I think 
Sakura-chan tired her out,&quot; I quipped, carefully calculating the 
reaction and deciding on the uncharacteristic reply. It was working 
guessing by the hearty chuckle from Sonomi and Sakura&#39;s exclamation of 
protest.
	&quot;Lisa!&quot; Sakura tried to look horrified but at the innocent wink 
I sent her she actually let go of her reserve and succumbed to 
laughter. Golden eyes caught mine in a possessively affectionate and 
right now truly grateful look. It wouldn&#39;t last but I was glad that at 
least for a moment the mood had been brightened. Sylphiel probably 
would have fainted even entertaining the thought of implying what I 
just did in public. It had been pretty embarrassing and judging by the 
unrestrained chuckles I picked up from Soyo-chan I would probably be 
teased about it for a long time. But seeing Sakura a bit more relaxed 
was worth it.
	&quot;Actually, what I wanted to say is,&quot; I stirred the conversation 
back on topic, &quot;and I&#39;d suggest you tell your family that as well, 
Sakura-chan. We don&#39;t know how anyone will react. Maybe you shouldn&#39;t 
go to work for a few days, Okaasan.&quot; I didn&#39;t even want to mention 
what would happen if Pandora started to start swarming the city with 
her minions. That would probably be only possible with at least two 
thirds of the seal down but I wouldn&#39;t swear on this with my life.
	&quot;I&#39;m not sure I can afford to,&quot; the older Daidouji admitted 
thoughtfully.
	&quot;Onegai, Okaasan, listen to them,&quot; Tomoyo&#39;s voice entered the 
room. She was slowly walking over from the entrance, still a little 
sleepy and with an odd... carefulness in her step. Well, it would be 
odd if one didn&#39;t know what had happened yesterday. Darn, I really had 
a dirty mind this morning... *Shut up, Soyo-chan!* I reprimanded my 
elemental mentally... to no great avail. However, I doubted anyone 
could really blame me after last night&#39;s activities that had been 
necessary to properly get Sakura out of her steadily decreasing 
mood...
	&quot;I can feel the... vibes that field is giving off. I think it&#39;ll 
start affecting people&#39;s subconsciousness soon,&quot; Tomoyo continued, her 
voice laced with concern. Sakura and I exchanged a sharp look of 
concern at the analysis. Amelia had had a very far developed skill to 
pick things like that up and while underdeveloped for now, Tomoyo was 
no exception there. The method sounded like something Pandora would 
use but the possibility was not too comforting.
	Sonomi raised an eyebrow at her daughter&#39;s slightly disheveled 
appearance, drawing a cute little blush form pale cheeks, but the 
insistent and concerned look from the dark-haired girl made her 
swallow any comment she might have made. &quot;Maybe that is why I should,&quot; 
the older Daidouji spoke softly, &quot;I understand there might be panic. 
I&#39;ve been dealing with media long enough to see how things like that 
work. I have a lot of influence on those working for me though, and 
don&#39;t you think it would help if their boss just stayed home at a time 
like this? I promise I&#39;ll be careful, alright?&quot;
	Tomoyo held her mother&#39;s gaze for a long time and then slowly 
nodded. A low rumble from her stomach broke the developing silence and 
made her blush again, a reaction you couldn&#39;t help but find absolutely 
adoring.
	&quot;I think,&quot; Sakura stated firmly, &quot;before we go into any more 
detail about what to do about,&quot; she made a gesture towards the window, 
&quot;this, we should probably finish eating.&quot;
	There were mumbles of agreement from all sides.

******************************

(Makoto)
A flash of crimson lightening tainted the dark sky momentarily in a 
bloody color and cast an eerie illumination into the spacious kitchen 
even though all the lights had been turned on. Forcefully I tried to 
ignore it for the moment, concentrating on finishing breakfast and 
preparations for the guests soon to arrive. The task was relaxing and 
managed to take my mind away from the present issue.
	As expected the news stations were overflowing with reports 
about the &quot;Tokyo Eclipse&quot;. At least that was what it had been dubbed 
more or less officially. Frankly I could care less about the press, 
however, the reaction would surely affect the further plan of action 
in this situation. A situation that really was entirely new. Most of 
the threats we had to deal with were often vague, yet never with a 
lack of temporary focus, something physical to grasp and battle, and a 
lot of them had been centered on us, the Royal Family or anything else 
connected to the Sailorsenshi. The world itself mostly had only been 
the battlefield, feeling the consequences only as side effects, mostly 
not even recognizing what was happening or not remembering afterwards.
	This was different. Now we basically knew what we were facing 
but were confined to waiting and reaction. A state that was tearing on 
my own nerves just like everyone else&#39;s. I tried to remain calm, 
especially since Hotaru and Minako were slouching around the house 
with a gloom and doom attitude, however, my own senses were playing 
havoc on me and the events and feelings of failure in protecting those 
dear to me were still rather fresh despite anything else that had 
happened and came up in the meantime. I might have come to accept the 
genuine feelings of the two other women but that didn&#39;t stop me, or 
actually only strengthened more the dark sense of failure during the 
attack that nearly cost us Minako, our daughter and much more in the 
process.
	They needed me to be calm now though. With their dual memories 
the reminder outside of what once had happened, threatening to repeat 
itself, had to be agonizing. Minako had somehow survived the unusual 
pregnancy and nearly fatal delivery, Hotaru had been holding the 
fragile relationship between the three of us together... not to 
mention more or less initiated it. The least I could do now was bury 
my own anxiety and provide the necessary support.
	I sighed, glancing over the arrangement. Breakfast was ready but 
as for the meeting... Thankfully a lot of leftovers and yet unused 
food had been stored here in the manor. From the looks of it, this 
meeting would be big and probably dwindle into the late evening hours 
at least. There was no way I could do all of this alone. And Sasami 
wasn&#39;t here yet... For a moment I debated with myself. In the end the 
decision was rather easy though seeing as with Rei&#39;s group alone as 
well as those mages, this had long ceased to be a Senshi-intern 
affair.
	Quickly finishing the last touches on breakfast I slipped out 
into the hallway, zooming in on the nearest phone. Frankly I thought 
it was a miracle that everything was still working in the house 
considering Minako&#39;s refusal to hire a maintenance staff. I never 
really asked how she managed to hold it relatively clean. Minako 
wasn&#39;t exactly the prime example of a housewife... A mystery that had 
to wait because of its low relevance.
	&quot;Hey, squirt, are your mommy or daddy around?&quot; I asked when the 
phone was picked up on the other end. There was an enthusiastic reply 
and some loud noise in the background as I waited. I couldn&#39;t help but 
chuckle at the image intruding into my mind.
	Eventually I managed to catch who I was looking for and 
arrangements were quickly made. My sensei and his wife were quite 
happy to help out and get some information on what was going on. I was 
pretty sure the manor could easily take two more people and the food 
my boss was going to bring along would surely be appreciated. Surely 
better than a couple of leftovers and hastily prepared meals.
	Finished with that task I returned to the kitchen and busied 
myself with getting the small breakfast over to the smaller, cozy 
dining room just across the hall that the three of us had come to 
prefer in the last months where we had mostly staid here to help 
Minako with the pregnancy... among other things.
	I was getting the last set of trays when Hotaru quietly entered 
the kitchen and offered her help without a word. I flashed her a 
grateful smile and together we finished the preparations. Both her and 
Minako had slipped away some while ago to contact the others and to 
give a rough explanation about the sky phenomena in order to prevent 
any wrong assumptions.
	&quot;You were calling someone earlier?&quot; Hotaru broke the silence 
between us and I was quite thankful for it. The eerie dusk scenery 
outside was wearing my resolve to stay calm very thin already. The 
gloomy atmosphere that had settled over everything was seeping into 
the manor like shadows creeping out of the corners.
	&quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t think the food is going to last for a longer 
meeting. I called my boss and sensei if they want to come over and 
bring some food from the restaurant.&quot; I glanced at Hotaru 
questioningly. &quot;You don&#39;t mind, do you?&quot;
	The dark-haired woman was quiet for a moment, then shrugged her 
shoulders, &quot;Not really. You trust them?&quot;
	&quot;Absolutely,&quot; I stated with unwavering conviction. From the 
start it had been pretty much impossible to hide my secret identity 
from them. Sensei was pretty good in reading auras and I would believe 
that ours are pretty distinctive. &quot;They&#39;ve seen their own share of 
weirdness. And believe me, there is no one better in physical combat 
than Saotome Ranma as far as I know. They have just as much at stake 
as everyone else here but they can help and I know them well enough to 
tell they won&#39;t like sitting on the sidelines.&quot;
	Hotaru smiled at my fierce speech and I tried to hide a blush 
when I realized just how vehement I had come over in pointing out that 
the two Saotomes could be trusted. &quot;I believe you, Mako-chan,&quot; Hotaru 
said in a reassuring tone, her hand briefly reaching up to touch the 
pendant she had given me. I was wearing it open around my neck, 
finding it far too pretty to conceal as she had done before. The 
pendant had the form of a silvery star framing a majestic eagle in 
shimmering blue colors.
	I caught the delicate hand of my lover as she wanted to pull 
away and held her gaze for a moment, preventing her from stealing 
glances outside. Both her and Minako had done it several times now 
since getting out of bed and those actions weren&#39;t exactly good for 
their mood. Hotaru tried to smile weakly at my attempt to avert 
attention but seemed nonetheless grateful.
	&quot;We&#39;ll get through this. Together, remember? That&#39;s what you 
said.&quot; I pulled Hotaru&#39;s hand around my own body and held her for a 
moment. The contact was doing both of us a whole world of good. I 
could feel not only her but also my tension draining slowly.
	I tried to think of something else to get her mind off the 
present events for a short time. I was just in the process of 
addressing the issue of names for our daughter, something that kind of 
drowned in the hectic of the last days and the abruptness of the 
delivery, but at that point Minako came into the room looking somewhat 
grim. I recognized the hard mask of the Senshi&#39;s leader having fallen 
into place, shutting out most other emotions. A soft smile tugged at 
her lips though finding us the way we were and wordlessly joined the 
hug. We stayed this way for several more seconds before parting and 
sitting down for breakfast.
	It was going to be a long day.

******************************

(Tomoyo)
I had had a weird feeling the moment I woke up this morning. And that 
definitely didn&#39;t have anything to do with the after effects of last 
night&#39;s activities. Certainly not. The layer of dusk-like darkness 
seemed to absorb and reflect every ounce of negative feeling and 
feeding it back to the people underneath multiplied. This was somewhat 
like a miniature version of the zone that Pandora had created four 
years ago when Sakura and I had barely managed to prevent her first 
attempt of breaking free. Not even really dangerous in the slightest, 
just provoking a subtle... discomfort. For a strong-willed person like 
a semi-trained mage it was easy to filter out and ignore. The most 
negative effect achieved was a certain increase in tension, a higher 
level of anxiety.
	For those not possessing the will power or mental strength to 
withstand the influence though, the effects would steadily increase. 
As we made our way through the district, crossing the short distance 
from the Tomoeda to the Azabu-Juuban region, we met several people 
walking around lost, clusters of clearly agitated inhabitants 
whispering, pointing upwards and trying to not get too far away from 
the safety of their group, survival instincts kicking in. Survival 
instincts for what, they couldn&#39;t tell, and that only added to the 
tense atmosphere that was plainly tangible in the air.
	&#39;Just one needs to snap and do something rash&#39;, I thought 
darkly, picking up on the sad reality of the situation. &#39;Just one and 
they may as well panic.&#39;
	The normal flow of business was severely disrupted. There wasn&#39;t 
the steady bustle, the streams of people going hither and wither. 
Several shops along the main business district of Minato-ku had not 
even opened yet, several usually well-frequented were almost vacant. 
The entire town seemed to have fallen into a lethargic state matching 
the suggested time of day, visually at least.
	&quot;I was in the wilderness of South America and there was more 
life than here, now,&quot; Lisa commented quietly, keeping her voice low as 
if trying not to draw attention or involuntarily set off a bonfire. 
Which, on a second thought, was a rather likely possibility to assume 
and to be wary of.
	&quot;If it&#39;s magical... can&#39;t it be broken?&quot; Kero asked from his 
place on Sakura&#39;s shoulder who was walking in between us with her face 
set in a stoic, serious mask. None of us tried to get her out of the 
mood. She was absolutely focused, taking in everything around her with 
a sharp eye. I had seen her do that a couple of times and wasn&#39;t quite 
sure if it was a trait she subconsciously drew from Lina, had 
developed herself or a mix of both. This expression was rather much 
like the one my mate acquired in the heat of battle. Focused, 
analyzing, ready.
	We had taken a small detour in order to tell Sakura&#39;s family 
about what to expect in this situation and where we were going to be 
the entire day. The Clow Book guardian had insisted on coming along. 
So had Yue actually but he had eventually relented and stayed with 
Touya and Sakura&#39;s father, just in case.
	&quot;Possible, but tricky,&quot; the redhead replied to the small 
creature&#39;s question. &quot;What we are seeing here is not really a rip in 
time and space, but more like a mirage in the desert for example. We 
perceive it as being there because our senses tell us it is. At the 
same time it&#39;s still like a dimensional layer.&quot; Sakura reached up to 
rub her forehead in frustration. &quot;It&#39;s really hard to explain and 
since I&#39;m sure the question will come up several times again today, 
let&#39;s just say that it is not as easy as you might think.&quot;
	&quot;However, Kero-chan is right,&quot; I pointed out. &quot;If this state 
continues it will drive Tokyo crazy and the panic will quickly wash 
over to the rest of the country and onwards. Maybe even without 
Pandora needing to make another move.&quot;
	The redheaded sorceress gave a weary sigh. &quot;Of course, you are 
both right. The real problem is that the effort will not really be 
much of a benefit. As soon as she breaks more of the seal, this layer 
will become quite real actually, even if we manage to temporally 
dispel it. That I am almost certain of.&quot; A grimace distorted the 
beautiful features even more and I glanced away defeated, seeing the 
logic in the statement. A no-win situation.
	The rest of the walk was resumed in mutual silence, matching the 
atmosphere. We weren&#39;t even trying to hide the connection between us. 
Both Lisa and I were holding one of Sakura&#39;s hands and walking quite 
close to the redhead. No one paid us much attention. The display of 
affection usually frowned upon in Japanese society had become an 
instinctual reaction. People everywhere were reaching out to each 
other to reassure themselves that they were not totally alone in the 
eerie, unnatural darkness. It was fascinating how social standards in 
a situation like this seemed to crumble away, showing just how fragile 
and unimportant the worldview claimed by the general mass was.
	Therefore us keeping close to each other was widely ignored, 
even more so than usual. Sakura and I had never shied away making sure 
that no misinterpretations were left open about the nature of our 
relationship to all those who more or less asked about it. We had 
never went and threw the fact around so that everyone knew but instead 
acting naturally and not shying away should someone ask or comment. 
And Lisa seemed to be the sort of person that would prefer a similar, 
natural approach. Actually from what I remembered she was a lot more 
open and less shy with her feelings than Sylphiel had been. The both 
of us seemed to be somewhere on the same level now in that field.
	The bond now was helping to create a bubble of safety, a place 
to draw strength from and all three of us readily did take to it. I 
noticed Kero eying Lisa with a speculative gaze. Since he had 
participate in the search he knew, of course, who she was and what she 
meant to us but he had not been privy to the events of the weekend 
directly - a circumstances both he and Yue had been rather verbal in 
pointing out how they weren&#39;t fond of being left in the dark with only 
an uneasy feeling of danger having befallen their mistress. Despite 
trying to hide it, Kero was very protective of Sakura, and had been 
really happy actually after Sakura had chosen me over Syaoran. Lisa 
didn&#39;t seem to be oblivious to the calculating stare but didn&#39;t return 
it either, instead keeping close to Sakura. Eventually the small 
guardian shook his head, gave a defeated smile and focused back on the 
path.
	Shortly afterwards we reached the address that Hotaru had given 
me and stopped in front of the gates of the manor, standing still for 
a moment to take in and admire the view. Well, Lisa did mostly, not 
really used to a spacious house yet. &quot;What is it with you guys and big 
houses anyway?&quot; our purple-haired mate commented with a slight shake 
of her head.	
	&quot;We barely know them in this time,&quot; Sakura answered and then 
after a pause added, &quot;Yet. Which is not so much unlike the last time 
around when I think about it.&quot;
	&quot;I understand the house has been a gift from Aino-san&#39;s former 
boss or something like this. I think she mainly accepted it out of 
courtesy, or at least that&#39;s what Hotaru-san told me,&quot; I explained 
further, having given the house a critical study in the maintain. &quot;It 
is certainly nice.&quot;
	&quot;Well, I am sure that I wouldn&#39;t deny a gift like that either,&quot; 
Lisa replied and stepped forward to test the gate, finding it 
unlocked. There was a brief resistance though as she stepped forward 
that I had picked up right away, like a very fine, translucent globe. 
The other girl nodded to herself, then simply passed through 
effortlessly, Sakura following right afterwards while I hurried to 
follow their example.
	&quot;I think we have no real right to be jealous anyway,&quot; Sakura 
smiled softly and exchanged a look with Lisa that I couldn&#39;t quite 
decipher.
	&quot;Yeah, I suppose I have to get used to palace life again. I&#39;m 
sure Babasan will tell me at some point that I&#39;m slacking off...&quot;
	I blinked, the hidden meaning of the exchange finally 
registering on me and frowned slightly, &quot;Our house isn&#39;t a palace.&quot;
	Lisa laughed lightly and I could see Sakura grinning, the mood 
momentarily boosted again by the playful banter as we made our way to 
the front door. &quot;No, but it&#39;s coming close. You might not be a Queen 
anymore but from all three of us you still inherited the highest 
social status once again.&quot; I could tell that the miko was teasing and 
allowed myself a blush, reaching over to playfully punch the other&#39;s 
arm while shifting a glare at the sound of a giggle from Sakura.
	The spell was broken when we arrived at the door though but the 
atmosphere had lightened somewhat. I had the feeling that the energy 
field we had passed seemed to have a counter effect against the 
undercurrent of the darkness outside and for that all of us were 
fairly grateful.

******************************

(Hotaru)
Usagi and Mamoru had been the first to arrive, together with Setsuna, 
shortly followed by Haruka and Michiru. Ami would probably be there 
any minute now and I just sensed the three mages passing through the 
barrier. It was costing me some level of concentration to keep it up 
but the dim undercurrent from Pandora&#39;s little gift was already 
beginning to affect our nerves and this meeting would need a more 
cleaner air in order to bring successful decisions. The barrier wasn&#39;t 
really complicated, just like an inversion to an inversion... sort of. 
The main trouble in keeping it up came from swimming against the 
current to make a graphic example. Nothing to tiring and definitely 
better than the nerve-wrecking, background sensation that as 
ineffective as it normally was against us, constantly blocking it out 
DID influence our mood quite well. This was much better.
	The city was caught between anxious confusion and a listless 
lethargy. It was like a soft blanket had begun to cover Tokyo. A 
blanket that at first only brought a sudden darkness but quickly those 
underneath realized it was meant to slowly suffocate them, suffocate 
them in their own growing fear. This was going to take awhile, of 
course, but not very long. An individual human life was clever but 
human lives acting as a mass awareness were predictable. The panic 
would come, sooner or later. And that was one of the many things that 
would have to be addressed today.
	I took a deep breath, feeling the energy settle down to a degree 
where my direct focus was no longer needed to maintain the barrier. A 
temporary solution that would not last long without recharging but for 
the designed purpose it was enough. I would have to discuss a more 
permanent solution with Lina at a later point. After we were certain 
about how to proceed in this situation.
	To say the change of pace had come surprising would be wrong. 
No, I had expected something like this to happen rather soon, but not 
THAT soon. Once again I had miscalculated, underestimated the current 
maximum capacities of our enemy. It was like that with Pandora, even 
back then. You thought to know exactly what to expect and in the next 
instant something would happen that shattered that belief completely. 
The swiftness of Pandora&#39;s action, especially in her still limited 
state, was frightening. And once again I had not anticipated it.
	Soundlessly I had moved onto the second story balcony that was 
connected to the small room. Looking out over the city, one wouldn&#39;t 
at first glance suspect something was drastically wrong, apart from 
the mismatching time of day and sky color, of course. The darkness 
seemed harmless, nothing else than a normal dusk to the normal eye. 
Nothing special at all...
	Like the eve of a long night. A town before going to sleep, 
maybe a long sleep. I closed my eyes remembering this time from so 
long ago when Pandora had made her presence known to the unsuspecting 
inhabitants of Earth for the first time. I wasn&#39;t sure I could or even 
wanted to compare the reaction then and what it might be now.
	&quot;It&#39;s funny,&quot; a voice startled me out of my reverie and I looked 
to the side, seeing Usagi standing there looking up into the sky, 
&quot;then I just focus a little bit, I can still see the sun and the blue 
sky. I barely need to make an effort.&quot; Usagi turned her head towards 
me and there was something in her gaze. Something so hauntingly 
familiar that I was stunned for just a moment, nearly missing her next 
question. &quot;I wonder, is this because of the Ginzuishou?&quot;
	Shaking my head slightly I focused on my Princess. &quot;Might be. 
Sere-chan had the same ability.&quot; The nickname was drawing out a 
fountain of emotions and memories, more so than I had allowed myself 
to feel in a long time. Seeing Tsunami again though, even... changed 
as she was, coupled with my own daughter now &#39;sleeping&#39; on her ship, I 
couldn&#39;t help but remember the times spent together. Peitho, the 
sisters and myself...
	&quot;Everyone should be here soon,&quot; Usagi said, changing the topic, 
as if sensing how much it seemed to affect me. No, not &quot;as if&quot;. She 
did sense how it was affecting me. That was one of her gifts that she 
had honed even further over the years. So much like... I quenched the 
thought for the time being.
	&quot;Hai. Kinomoto-san and the other two have just arrived. As soon 
as Rei with her friends get here we should be ready to start,&quot; I 
agreed. Rei had told Minako earlier that they would be a little late 
since there had been MASSES flooding the shrines and Hikawa Jinja was 
no exception. They had to deal with that first. People were seeking 
shelter and assurance in religion. Not an unexpected occurrence. There 
had been a drastic increase in former skeptic people turning to 
Ceiphied for guidance in the old time. Not that it had helped much.
	&quot;Do you believe it is right to bring everyone together now? I 
know I&#39;ve ordered this without speaking to you first but I believe it 
has been shown that acting separated would be fatal from now on.&quot; 
	A sharp pang of guilt lanced through me at the words. Surely 
Usagi didn&#39;t aim for that reaction but I could not help myself, having 
just thought about it myself. &quot;Gomen nasei,&quot; I mumbled quietly, 
feeling a need to express the feelings inside of me, knowing that 
Usagi would understand and listen. &quot;I have failed you when you were 
relying on me how to proceed. I have underestimated the leap in power 
that Pandora has apparently made and did not anticipate such a degree 
of resources could already be employed. And now we are on the verge of 
a war that can hardly be avoided anymore...&quot;
	I shuddered slightly at the gentle hand on my shoulder. The 
other woman turned me to face her and I swallowed at the soft, caring 
and forgiving gaze directed at me. &quot;Don&#39;t blame yourself, Hotaru-chan. 
I am sure that under the circumstances you have done the right thing. 
From all of us you had the most experience with Pandora, besides I 
didn&#39;t see Pluto disagreeing with you either. I believe no one had 
anticipated the swiftness and coordination of last weekend. I am sure 
that I would have not made a different decision either.&quot; The gentle 
look did not leave her blue eyes but it became more intense and 
serious. &quot;But now it is time that we pull all of our power together. I 
barely know most of those other people that are going to be here today 
which is why I am pretty sure that acting separately up to now has 
been the best idea. We were trying to divert attention and giving a 
less likely target. Maybe last weekend would have happened much 
earlier if we had not done it this way. No one can really tell. What 
needs to be done now is deal with the present and look to the future, 
not dwell in the past, in &#39;might have beens&quot; and &quot;would haves&quot;. I 
can&#39;t do that alone, I need you and everyone else to help me make the 
right decisions. You know far more what is at stake here.&quot;
	I held her gaze with my own for a moment, compelled to look away 
under the enormous trust I felt directed at me, but I was captured, 
locked in place. The unwavering hope that radiated from Usagi was 
infatuating, chasing away my dark thoughts and concerns about what 
would be upcoming conflict. And once again there was that tug, that 
familiar sensation... &quot;Arigato,&quot; I finally replied in a honest 
whisper. Memories of a similar talk with someone so similar to Usagi, 
familiar feelings of hope inspired just like now... I shook my head 
again. Surely I was imaging things. &quot;I guess I needed that. I&#39;ve never 
been much of a leader, so you&#39;d better ask Minako about that, but... 
but I&#39;ll help in any way I can. You can trust on that.&quot;
	&quot;Good,&quot; Usagi nodded thankfully, then suddenly turned to look 
out into the distance, a faraway look entering her eyes. &quot;Rei and her 
friends are coming.&quot; It wasn&#39;t an assumption and I blinked amazed 
because I had not registered the presence yet... Wait, there was 
Tsunami, I think. There still was a strong connection between us that 
enabled me to pick her out from a distance.
	&quot;You can tell?&quot;
	&quot;I can tell that Sasami is close by.&quot;
	THAT made me stare. Could it really be? Frankly, there were 
enough indicators that would verify the theory. There was not such a 
thing as coincidence in destiny. Everything did happen for a reason. 
The core that had fought Pandora so long ago had been reassembled in 
this time in various states of rebirth or simple survival. The only 
one really missing was...
	&quot;Sere-chan?&quot; I whispered quietly.

(Sakura)
There was a moment of awkward silence between us when it was Pluto who 
opened the door. We had talked a couple of times in the last months 
but not after the events of the weekend up to now. Pluto had always 
been hard to talk to, I suppose it lay in the nature of Time Guardians 
which probably should have made me suspicious towards the Time card&#39;s 
true purpose and identity. Now, there was an extra element added by 
the fact that I was sort of keeping her sister and mate to myself for 
the moment which greatly limited the time they could spent together. 
And after such a long time of separation. I believe there were several 
people around here who could understand on a personal level what that 
was like, me being amongst them.
	Unfortunately the magic of the card was all that still bound 
Persephone to the seal on some level and cutting that connection would 
mean forfeiting any influence she might still have on actions from 
within. I was eternally grateful for Persephone&#39;s offer to at least 
stay that way until the second part of the seal fell, namely Tomoyo&#39;s. 
I didn&#39;t really care about myself. I was sure, I could resist long 
enough on my own and frankly with a two third advantage there were 
other options open for Pandora to fully break free without 
concentrating on me. Yet Tomoyo I would not, could not expose to such 
a danger. I had almost lost Lisa already to that devil...
	&quot;Come in,&quot; Pluto broke the silence eventually, stepping aside. 
That at least brought my thoughts to a sudden stop which probably was 
a good thing. I could not afford to be distracted right now. 
Especially not after Tomoyo and Lisa had made such a valiant effort to 
bring me away from thoughts like this. The understanding look that the 
ancient Senshi was sending me was also rather relieving. She 
understood why her sister had offered this solution. It had to hurt 
but she understood and accepted nonetheless. There was something 
between all of us that had survived or remembered the Creation War and 
its outcome. Neither of us did wish to lose anyone again. The series 
of sacrifices was not to be repeated, with all possible means.
	Now was as good a time as any, I thought to myself. The recharge 
should be complete by now. There wasn&#39;t a word needed, just a short 
moment of concentration and in a flash of green-purple Time was 
released from the book, forming the spiritual body. I focused my 
awareness and repeated what I had done two days ago, supplying a 
temporary, physical form that was an exact replica of what the Senshi 
Persephone had been like. This would do for awhile. A little straining 
but I felt compelled to the effort as a part of the compromise. 
Besides, it wasn&#39;t much different as supporting Kerberos&#39; true form 
with my magic in the beginning when I wasn&#39;t able to access the 
resources I could now.
	&quot;We are almost complete now,&quot; Pluto explained, barely able to 
hold her usual unwavering composure as Persephone moved over to stand 
beside her. I shared a knowing look with my mates but chose not to 
comment. &quot;We are just waiting for a few more to arrive. Mostly Mars 
and her group. I understand they are stuck for a while at the Jinja.&quot;
	Lisa nodded in understanding. &quot;Babasan told me the same. It 
seems the shrines are overflowing.&quot; We had actually seen many of the 
groups we&#39;ve come across moving towards one of the shrines in the 
area. I never saw Japanese culture as overly religious, more... very 
traditional. And seeking shelter in tradition was giving most citizens 
a sense of security.
	&quot;We should probably join everyone then,&quot; Persephone said 
smoothly and started to move towards the direction where I could sense 
several strong auras clustered together.
	I was about to follow but barely made a few steps before being 
stopped again. &quot;Before you do that, can I have a moment please?&quot; I 
looked around and located the familiar voice as Phoebe - it was more 
easier to think of her by that name - standing on the base of the 
stairs leading to the next floor.
	I glanced at Tomoyo and then Lisa who had also stopped. Both of 
them shrugged. &quot;Go ahead,&quot; Tomoyo said and took Lisa&#39;s hand, moving to 
follow the two Time Guardians again. Kero hesitated a moment but then 
flew over to settle on Tomoyo&#39;s shoulder. I nodded to Phoebe and 
followed her up the stairs.
	It was hard to distinguish the auras of several different people 
in here, especially since they were all so uniquely strong but the one 
I could sense up here was nearly unmistakable and so I wasn&#39;t all too 
surprised when the raven-haired girl lead me to a small room and found 
Serenity - well, this generation&#39;s Serenity - sitting there. She 
seemed somewhat... anxious, a bit confused maybe, but that had nothing 
to do with Pandora&#39;s nasty trick. Especially since this seemed to be 
the room from which the barrier had been spread out. I nodded to 
myself in silent approval before focusing on the other two woman.
	&quot;Hello, Kinomoto-san,&quot; the blonde woman greeted warmly, 
inspiring a strong sense of similarity to the young Serenity that I 
had briefly gotten to know in the beginning of the year. The same 
brilliant aura, the same sparkle of unwavering hope.
	&quot;Onegai, call me Sakura-chan, everyone does,&quot; I replied, 
instantly taking a liking to the other woman that was obviously 
carrying the highest authority and respect with the Senshi of this 
life cycle. I never really had gotten the chance to see the monarch 
Serenity, I had only known the cheerful girl and strong warrior. The 
period that was known as the Silver Millennium I only knew about out 
of a few explanation from Phoebe. I could see why the other Senshi 
were loyal to her though.
	&quot;Then call me Usagi-chan,&quot; she insisted with a smile. I was 
reminded of that formal first meeting between our groups in Saillune 
and couldn&#39;t help the answering smile.
	Phoebe chuckled in obvious memory of the same events but quickly 
sobered. &quot;Sakura-san, you were able to tell that Minako was Peitho 
before I could, isn&#39;t that correct?&quot;
	&quot;In a way,&quot; I answered, not quite sure what the purpose of the 
question was. However, I did know that with their bond the other girl 
COULD have discovered that much earlier but chose to ignore it, 
deliberately or not. That was not really the point though. &quot;Why?&quot; I 
inquired.
	Phoebe and Usagi exchanged a long look and there was definitely 
a question being asked and answered in the process. The blonde woman 
with the distinctive hairstyle nodded slowly and Phoebe took a deep 
breath. &quot;We have reason to assume that Usagi here might be Serenity. 
OUR Serenity.&quot;
	I started, taken completely by surprise at the possibility. 
After thinking on it for a moment it was like another piece to a big 
puzzle falling into place though. It made perfect sense. The 
resemblance was nearly perfect. Of course, that could be a special 
aspect of the Ginzuishou. I had not known any of the other Serenitys 
that followed personally to draw a sufficient conclusion and had to 
trust Phoebe&#39;s judgment there.
	&quot;That,&quot; I commented slowly, &quot;would be beneficial.&quot; If the 
Serenity I&#39;ve known and the leader of the Senshi in this time were 
identical, we would not only have the strong power of the Ginzuishou 
at our disposal but also the memories of someone who had employed it 
against Pandora already.
	Concentrating for a moment, I called Memory from her place in 
the book. &quot;I don&#39;t have the assurance that Love was able to give me 
with Peitho but... we can try accessing the memories IF they are 
there.&quot; I held up the card and looked sharply at Usagi. &quot;With your 
consent, of course. I cannot guarantee on the success or what memories 
would be unlocked.&quot;
	Usagi took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, before giving a 
firm nod. &quot;That is alright. I have adjusted to my former life, I&#39;m 
sure I can deal with another, if this helps us in any way.&quot; I searched 
her eyes for a long time but could only find deep resolve and trust.
	&quot;It will,&quot; I confirmed, holding up the card. &quot;Believe me, it 
will.&quot;

******************************

&lt;200000 BC ()&gt;
Flashes of red lightning illuminated the sky, crashing down to the 
ground and wasting even more of the already battered and nearly broken 
land. Pitch blackness had become a natural state and the temperature 
had slowly began to drop the last weeks, further adding to the fear of 
the people everywhere. Now the darkness was not merely an illusion but 
a manifestation of the power of that monster that had come to claim 
their world.
	The holy barrier encompassing the capital city of Saillune was 
beginning to falter under the pressure of evil all around it, and even 
now what was once a beautiful kingdom now remained as merely a shade 
of its original self. Buildings were crumbled, the streets were lined 
with refugees from the surrounding areas. The city had become the last 
bastion for those still left with hope and the will to fight or merely 
for those who tried to lull themselves in a last sense of security.
	It didn&#39;t really matter anymore. Everything would be over 
tomorrow. One way or another. The nearly two years long war of 
survival was nearing its final battle, their last attempt, their last 
hope. Everyone who still had spirit left to draw upon, every last 
member of the resistance, that had so bravely managed to survive in 
the face of such great opposition that entire star systems had 
crumbled under much faster, was clustered together in Saillune, ready 
to follow their leaders, themselves, in the final battle. A battle 
that would cost even more lives, demand even more sacrifices. A battle 
that was not avoidable anymore.
	&#39;So many lives lost. So many sacrifices.&#39;
	Young Serenity, princess of a long fallen, forgotten and 
unimportant kingdom, as well as Senshi of the small, unimportant 
satellite Earth called it&#39;s moon, was standing on a balcony of the 
Royal Palace of Saillune... though nowadays it gave more the 
impression of a fort ready to take on the hordes of hell themselves... 
which wasn&#39;t all that inaccurate. The plan had been made, a plan that 
made every last one of the young woman&#39;s insides twist at the costs 
involved. It was insane, suicidal, UNACCEPTABLE... the only plan that 
had a sliver of a chance to even work.
	Her gaze wondered down to the brooch in her hands, the bright 
sparkle of the Ginzuishou seeming to create a bubble around it that 
could not be touched by Pandora&#39;s darkness. Pure and strong, full of 
so much potential. Potential she did not know how to really use even 
though she desperately wished to. Not because she wanted to be more 
powerful but so that she could protect her friends, prevent the many 
sacrifices of others. Especially right now.
	Senshi Persephone stood in the shadows for a long time watching 
the golden-haired woman stare at her crystal as if wanting to draw out 
the secrets with her eyes. &quot;Do not trouble yourself. The understanding 
will come to you when you most need it,&quot; she finally said, making her 
presence known. It had not been hard to find the girl when she had 
slipped away after the strategy meeting was concluded and the 
green-haired Time Guardian could guess what was on her mind.
	Serenity stared at the older woman&#39;s casual tone incredulously 
before her features shifted into a mixture of determination and 
desperation. &quot;I can&#39;t wait that long. If I don&#39;t figure it out before 
tomorrow... then you will...&quot; Her voice cracked and she squeezed the 
older Senshi&#39;s hands painfully as Persephone grasped her own.
	&quot;Serenity-hime, what happens to me is my decision. And even if 
you were to understand your star seed&#39;s true powers, what good will it 
do if released prematurely? I must go that path, it is in my fate, as 
it is in your fate to be one day a strong leader and a wise ruler.&quot;
	Serenity shook her head in denial. &quot;How can I be when I let 
everyone around me die. What kind of ruler could I be then?&quot;
	Persephone smiled, seeing once again her and her sister&#39;s 
judgment verified that this girl was to be their savior, the light 
that would guide the universe into a better future. &quot;As much as we 
wish to, some things are simply beyond our control. It is painful, to 
me, to you, to everyone else, but we cannot change it.&quot; Green strands 
fell over her face as the Time Guardian closed her eyes for a brief 
moment before reopening them with an intense light shining in them 
that took Serenity by surprise. &quot;Promise me something, Serenity-hime.&quot;
	&quot;Everything,&quot; the younger woman answered without hesitation. She 
knew in her heart, as painful as it was, that Persephone was right, 
that her part in tomorrow&#39;s assault was vital and could not be 
changed, regardless of her own or anyone else&#39;s importance. The least 
she could do was honor her last wish.
	&quot;WHEN Pandora is defeated, WHEN this nightmare is finally over, 
you must lead the people who have lost so much into a new, better era. 
One of peace. You have the gift inside of you, everyone trusts in you 
immediately. They will follow you. Those left behind will need such a 
strong, guiding soul like yourself to orient themselves towards. 
Oneechan and I have always believed that you are the one to bring this 
universe to a new unity. Don&#39;t let our hope be in vain.&quot;
	The intensity of the belief and trust directed at her made 
Serenity feel meager, tiny, unsuited. She was not worthy of that trust 
but still they were all confiding in her, following her, loving her. 
She and her sister were the youngest and yet everyone looked to her as 
the light that would shine in the darkness and carry them through.
	It did not matter what she thought. She could not, WOULD NOT let 
this trust be in vain.
	&quot;I promise,&quot; Serenity, soon to be first Queen of the Silver 
Millennium answered, but those two simple words held a vow carrying so 
much more than could be explained in words.

******************************

(Usagi)
My awareness returned to the present gradually. The memory more like a 
mist briefly cleared only to overflow the air with its presence faster 
than it had been banished. However, the recollection of the event, the 
brief glimpse, the emotions accompanying the images were still present 
and would remain as such. I had been allowed a short view through the 
eyes of the one which had supposedly been the beginning of our line.  
I had seen not only with her eyes though but also with her heart. A 
heart heavy with the responsibility put upon at such a young age but 
even more so heavy with guilt and helplessness at her own inability to 
prevent the countless deaths and sacrifices all around her.
	There had been so much more in that promise. Silent, unsaid but 
present. More for herself than anyone else. Serenity had fulfilled 
Persephone&#39;s promise but she had failed the one that she made to 
herself. Even after the war had been fought, even after the Silver 
Millennium had first come to be, she had lost even more, more of those 
she had promised to protect, their lives and their happiness, had been 
taken away. Pluto out of grief, Phoebe out of duty, and dear Tsunami 
because of... She did not even know why then. Only Peitho had been 
left, but even she was merely present in the physical sense most of 
the time.
	&quot;Princess?&quot; Phoe... no, Hotaru&#39;s soft but concerned voice 
brought me fully back to reality and a determination I had seldom felt 
before filled me.
	Never again. Never again would I let this happen. There would be 
NO repeat of this time. I was stronger now, I did have the experience, 
I knew what my crystal, the Ginzuishou, was capable of and I would use 
that knowledge to ensure that this time no one would need to be 
sacrificed. Crystal Tokyo would be a place for everyone to live in who 
helped to craft its existence. Everyone. This had been my decision at 
the Cauldron and that decision had not changed in the slightest. I 
would protect my friends and the friends of my friends, because 
without their support, I could not continue my path. The new age would 
find a happy, fulfilling beginning and not the sad reality the Silver 
Millennium had been.
	Hotaru shirked back slightly when I lifted my head, the crescent 
moon sigil glowing brightly. My voice was firm and baring no argument. 
&quot;I vow that this time no one will leave this battle hurt and alone. 
Together we will prevail and bring about a new age. Together.&quot;
	There was only a short pause before the other two girls&#39; 
expressions began to match my own solemn one. &quot;This vow we carry with 
you through heaven and hell,&quot; Hotaru spoke, her eyes more unguarded 
for a moment when I had ever seen them before. The pain of loss like a 
burning fire that she wished to quell with her words.
	&quot;To the end of time and beyond,&quot; Sakura finished with a 
seriousness, eyes hard but clearly not vacant of the same haunting 
look.
	Our gazes locked for a timeless moment as the impromptu vow was 
sealed. Then I turned my head to regard the floating sprite form of 
the Memory card with a gentle and grateful smile. &quot;Arigato, little 
one. You helped me very much.&quot; It had just been a glimpse, a fleeting 
memory, but it was enough to make the cracks I had noticed awhile ago 
open wider, wide enough so that I could slip in and see what lay 
beneath with some effort. I had always known there was something 
there, something other than Princess Serenity from the fallen Moon 
Kingdom. It had become steadily harder and harder to ignore over time. 
Now I had a way to see beneath that which had been beyond my grasp for 
so long. I wasn&#39;t afraid of the possible change anymore. Especially 
not if it might mean that I had a better chance of protecting those 
dear to me.
	The card spirit grinned proudly before vanishing in a small 
burst of light.
	The sequence was executed fluently as I rose from where I was 
sitting, the Ginzuishou reacting to my feelings immediately, forming 
in a ripple of light the white dress signifying my statue as heir to 
the Silver Millennium. &quot;I believe we have a meeting to attend.&quot; I did 
not wait for the response of the other two women, my steps directed 
purposefully out of the room and towards the stairs. Hotaru and Sakura 
fell into step behind me.
	I could feel that why we had been busy upstairs Rei&#39;s party had 
reached the manor as well. And so, as I descended the stairs, I 
stopped halfway down. The blue-haired girl did so as well and seemed 
to turn at the same time that my eyes fell on her. For a short moment 
recognition passed between us with undeniable clarity. Only for a 
moment though. I could not allow more. This had to wait until a later 
point, there would be time afterwards. Now there were different things 
to do and the brief glimpse I had been allowed into the life of the 
first Serenity had provided me with the connection to properly focus 
on that crisis that I had been searching in the hectic of the events.
	Until the battles of this weekend I had not fully understood the 
direness of this situation but now I was even more assured that this 
enemy was unlike anything we had ever faced before and every resource 
at our disposal would be needed to emerge victorious.
	No word was spoken but even so I knew that the other girl 
understood, shared the same thoughts. There was time to reconnect 
later. I continued my descent slowly, Sasami joining Rei who had 
watched the exchange from her place at the door and as one the group 
moved forward into the living room where everyone had been assembled. 
Senshi, friends and allies alike.
	Most of them I did barely or not even know at all but my friends 
trusted them and so would I. The outcome of the upcoming battle would 
be uncertain but one thing was for sure, these brave people would be 
the core fighting for our all survival. And I would stay to my word, 
fulfill the vow that I had given. I took in every face suddenly 
looking up and towards me as I entered the room. I could see the wisps 
of hope entering their eyes, even those who barely knew me. I had long 
since accepted that I had this effect on people. And I would not 
disappoint that trust.
	For a moment I was startled by the presence of two unexpected 
but familiar faces located next to Mamoru. I had meant to call them 
but had found no time to do so. I wasn&#39;t particular surprised at their 
presence but more curious how exactly they had found us here. Looking 
past the short redhead and the taller blue-haired woman I found my 
answer sitting on my husband&#39;s shoulders in form of a tiny pixie with 
light blue hair. A soft smile momentarily penetrated my serious 
demeanor. It appeared we were as complete as somehow possible for the 
moment.
	I wasn&#39;t one for big speeches or great entrances, even though 
the effect might be given right now, so I simply made my way over to 
Mamoru and waited until everyone had settled down.
	&quot;Let us begin.&quot;

THE END of Foreshadowed Dusk
TO BE CONTINUED in Clouded Stars

Author&#39;s Notes

Okay, didn&#39;t I say that the second part would be the longest? Oh, 
well, you can never predict those things... especially not with such a 
hyper muse.

Anyway, I don&#39;t have very much to say actually. This is the conclusion 
of the Dusk as you can see and therefore the conclusion of the first 
main arc. Before we start with the second main arc (so to say the main 
main arc) there will be a... no, I won&#39;t say short interlude because 
if I do it won&#39;t be short. ^_^ I can&#39;t really say how long yet. 
I cannot quite say when I will get to the Interlude and next main arc 
because now we are entering a phase where I first need to be 
completely sure about all back stories involved, so I may focus on the 
one or other side story first.

Either way. This part was supposed to be a bit... lighter than the 
last. Not exactly reached that goal I guess but I wasn&#39;t planning a 
fluffy part either. What I was aiming for was to bring the two triads 
together and solve their immediate problems, which I did.

I could now go and address various questions... and end up always 
pointing out that they will be answered eventually. The connections 
between the various fandoms will become more clearer as well as their 
background stories. So be patient. :) And yes, there is a logical 
explanation for the Ranma 1/2 element. There is, I swear!

With sending out this part, I will take some time off from the net or 
the computer because I will go undergo a cataract operation on my 
eyes. They are done separately so that will result in very limited to 
no eye-straining activity for... well, the better part of a month or a 
little more. You can still send in feedback and all that but don&#39;t 
expect me to answer until I&#39;m through with the whole damn procedure 
and all better.

That&#39;s actually all. Be sure to step by and look up the Soul Lights 
Continuum webpage (http://sl.catstrio.de), it&#39;s still rather tiny but 
there will be more information soon. Besides, side stories are still 
open for taking (look up the Contribution section).

And now feed the muse and the author because we have worked hard and 
are now hungry!
 
Ja ne, yours
