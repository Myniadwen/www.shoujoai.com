<a href="../slayers/mirror-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>        There was a moment of cautious silence as the ragged 
travelers led Lina and Naga into the village, then a sudden cry of 
joy. Figures streamed out of the homes, embracing their loved ones 
they had thought dead and gone, tearful reunions going on all around 
them.

        &quot;Wonder when that feast will start,&quot; Lina murmured, her red 
hair flowing around her as she studied the place with a wary gaze.

        &quot;Lina!&quot; Naga scolded her.

        &quot;Carolyn!&quot; an older man threw his arms around the little 
blonde, the man dressed in the sort of formal robes a mayor might 
wear.

        &quot;Daddy,&quot; Carolyn hugged him back.

        &quot;How is this possible?&quot; he murmured, his steely gray hair 
pushed back from his face.

        &quot;It was these two noble paladin&#39;s,&quot; the beaming Carolyn 
gestured to where Naga and Lina stood, &quot;who saved us from the 
dragons.&quot; She drew her father over, &quot;Lady Naga, Lina, I would like 
you to meet my father, Lord Dennis.&quot;

        &quot;Dennis?&quot; Naga blinked.

        Lord Dennis shrugged, &quot;We&#39;re an informal people.&quot; He smiled 
broadly, putting a hand on both of their shoulders, &quot;Thank you so 
much for saving my daughter!&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Lina said dryly, &quot;where&#39;s the food?&quot;

        With a sudden move Lord Dennis clasped them close and 
whispered to Naga, &quot;And if you lay one hand on my daughter, I&#39;ll 
kill you myself.&quot;

        &quot;Ah, what?&quot; Naga was clearly stunned as the older man strode 
off, shouting out commands for the preparation of a feast.

        &quot;Obviously he knows his daughter pretty well,&quot; Lina noted 
dryly.

        &quot;Lady Naga,&quot; Carolyn all but slinked over to them, her sweet 
smile reserved for Naga alone, &quot;would you care for me to escort you 
around the town?&quot; Looking down modestly she drawled, &quot;There are so 
many private corners I&#39;d love to show you.&quot;

        &quot;Ah.. I..&quot; Naga looked desperately at Lina.

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Lina said firmly, &quot;but I and my partner need to 
discuss where we&#39;ll be journeying to next. Please, excuse us.&quot;

        Carolyn all but pouted as Lina and Naga strode away. &quot;Maybe 
we could hook up later?&quot; she called out hopefully.

        &quot;Shut up and keep walking,&quot; Naga muttered to Lina softly.

        The two women made it around the corner of one of the 
buildings before Lina lost it, leaning there laughing 
uncontrollably. &quot;Private corners,&quot; Lina chuckled softly, &quot;I&#39;m sure 
she has one or two she&#39;d like to show you!&quot;

        &quot;This isn&#39;t funny,&quot; Naga answered, but her lips twitched in 
an involuntary smile.

        &quot;Oh, yes it is,&quot; Lina grinned. She tilted her head to the 
side, &quot;You do realize she&#39;s going to try to sit right beside you at 
the victory dinner.&quot;

        &quot;Goddess,&quot; Naga muttered to herself softly, running her hand 
through her short black hair, &quot;this has never happened to me 
before.&quot; She gave Lina a pleading look, &quot;I suppose we couldn&#39;t skip 
the dinner, just leave?&quot;

        &quot;What?!&quot; Lina blurted.

        &quot;Right, dumb question,&quot; Naga grimaced. &quot;So how are we going 
to get through this without a protective daddy trying to kill me?&quot;

        &quot;Huh,&quot; Lina frowned, looking cutely smart. A smile slowly 
spread across her face, &quot;I have an idea.&quot; A little pause as she 
looked over at Naga, &quot;You aren&#39;t going to like it.&quot;

        &quot;Anything that doesn&#39;t start a military vendetta, I like,&quot; 
Naga said firmly. Lina leaned forward, softly whispering in Naga&#39;s 
ear as the woman&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;You&#39;re right, I don&#39;t like it,&quot; 
she finally admitted, &quot;but I think it&#39;ll work.&quot;

        Carolyn&#39;s eyes lit up as the two women came back around the 
corner. She adjusted her top, taking a breath to make her most.. 
formidable aspects more visible. She was about to move over to them 
when they stopped, partially concealed from the crowds.

        Lina put a hand on Naga&#39;s arm as she said loudly, &quot;You 
forgot something, love.&quot;

        &quot;Oh?&quot; Naga looked down at her dramatically.

        &quot;This,&quot; Lina went up on tiptoes, grabbing Naga by the back 
of the head and drawing her down into a fierce kiss. They seemed to 
meld together, the kiss continuing as Naga took control, cradling 
the smaller woman close.

        Carolyn stood frozen as the two women walked away, hand in 
hand. &quot;It seems she&#39;s taken,&quot; the blonde sighed to herself 
wistfully, &quot;too bad.&quot;

        Naga was careful not to break into a run, a blush staining 
her pale cheeks as they walked away from where the clearly bemused 
Carolyn stood. &quot;So do you think we convinced her?&quot; she murmured to 
Lina softly.

        &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Lina agreed. She looked up at Naga, a blush to 
her own cheeks as she demanded, &quot;Where did you learn to kiss like 
that?&quot;

        Naga&#39;s cheeks went a deeper red, if that was possible. &quot;My 
Lina and I were together a long time,&quot; was the bashful answer, &quot;we 
had a lot of time to.. uh.. experiment.&quot;

        &quot;I did not need to know that,&quot; Lina groaned.

        The towns people came out as they walked together through 
the village, the men and women offering their thanks for the rescue 
from the dragons. Naga turned down all the gifts that were offered 
them, giving Lina a scolding look whenever she was about to take one.

        An older lady, still regally beautiful and dressed in finery 
approached them as dinner time neared. &quot;I am the Lady Alex,&quot; she 
introduced herself, her black streaked with silver hair catching the 
sunlight, &quot;I also wanted to thank you for saving my daughter, 
Carolyn.&quot;

        Naga and Lina exchanged wary looks before Lina finally 
asked, &quot;You aren&#39;t going to try threatening Naga, too?&quot;

        Lady Alex shook her head with a smile, &quot;My apologies. My 
husband is rather vigorous in protecting our daughter&#39;s perceived 
virtue.&quot;

        &quot;Perceived?&quot; Naga raised an eyebrow.

        &quot;I am well aware that my daughter has not been chaste,&quot; Alex 
said to them dryly. She looked up at Naga, &quot;Thank you for letting 
her down easily with your little show.&quot;

        Lina took Naga&#39;s arm, smiling sweetly, &quot;Show? What show?&quot;

        &quot;As you wish,&quot; Alex gave them both a smile. She 
hesitated, &quot;My husband has been informed of your relationship, as 
well, and I believe he has arranged for you two to share a room this 
evening.&quot; With that, she walked away.

        &quot;Oh, dear,&quot; Naga muttered to herself softly.

        Lina gave the taller woman a smile, &quot;You sound just like 
Amelia, you know.&quot; She took a deep breath, patting Naga&#39;s 
arm, &quot;We&#39;ll manage.&quot;

        Bells rang out, announcing that it was time to eat. The 
dinner was held in the great meeting hall of the town, a massive 
table covered by dishes as the town&#39;s people gathered along it&#39;s 
length. Lina and Naga were seated in positions of honor at the 
front, right beside the Lord and his family.

        Sadly, that put Carolyn on one side of the visibly pale 
Naga, and Lina on Naga&#39;s other side. Carolyn was dressed in finery, 
a sleek little gown of the finest fabrics that clung to her graceful 
form, highlighting her many charms. Charms she went to a great deal 
of trouble to present to Naga, from bending over to grab a glass 
to &#39;dropping&#39; her napkin.

        Still, Lina and Naga tried to act like a perfect couple, 
seemingly lost in each other even as they tried their absolute best 
to ignore Carolyn while still talking politely. Alex was a great 
help to them, and even Lord Dennis relaxed enough to treat them as 
his honored guests, and not potential seducers of his bosomy 
daughter.

        &quot;Thank the goddess that&#39;s all over,&quot; Naga muttered as they 
retreated to the bedroom they had been assigned.

        &quot;You have to admit the food was good,&quot; Lina offered 
cheerfully.

        Before Naga could answer there was a soft knock on the door. 
Naga walked over and opened it, only to freeze in place.

        Carolyn stood there, a smile on her face, a nearly 
transparent gown rustling around her body. A finely shaped body at 
that, utterly revealed by the thin material. In a breathy voice she 
smiled, &quot;I was wondering if the two of you would like some company 
tonight?&quot;

        &quot;Ah..&quot; Naga stood there with her mouth open.

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Lina took hold of Naga&#39;s arm to give the 
gorgeous blonde a dangerous smile, &quot;but we&#39;re exclusive.&quot;

        Carolyn gave Lina a glare, then looked up at Naga. &quot;I do not 
understand why you would be with one so poorly endowed,&quot; she frowned.

        &quot;She has other qualities,&quot; Naga gave the woman a grave 
look, &quot;like tact and charm.&quot;

        &quot;Humph!&quot; Carolyn turned to stalk down the hallway.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Lina blinked once she was gone.

        &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Naga sighed, shutting and locking the door.
