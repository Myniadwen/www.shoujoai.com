<h1>Curses and Control (part 3 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hawk.html">Hawk Shadowharper</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../slayers/curses-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>It was nighttime and the four slayers were sitting around a campfire,
enjoying a meal of roasted fish. They were only a day&#39;s walk away from
Malfia now. Throughout the day, Lina never let go of Ser, either keeping
an arm around her shoulders or waist, or hooking one of the blond girl&#39;s
arms around her own.

All this contact did not go unnoticed, of course. &quot;Lina, is there
something wrong,&quot; Zel asked from the other side of the fire. Lina looked
up, sitting beside Ser on one of their bedrolls.

&quot;Hmm...?&quot; was her intelligent response.

&quot;Uhm, just that... you&#39;ve been... uhm, how do I put this...&quot; Now that he
thought about it, Zel felt like a fool.

&quot;You&#39;ve been so close to Seraya all day, is there something wrong?&quot; Even
if he was slow, Gourry was also blunt. Instead of rolling her eyes or
hitting him, however, Lina just shrugged.

&quot;Not that I know of, does it really matter?&quot;

&quot;Uhm...&quot; Gourry thought about it for a while, then answered, &quot;No.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Later that night, after the last rays of sunlight had faded and the dark
sky was filled with stars, the slayers had fallen asleep around the dying
fire. Not surprisingly, Lina had bunked down near Ser.

After the last flicker of their campfire died out, Lina crawled out of
her bedding and kneeled beside Ser. The sorceress watched her a moment,
then lightly brushed the hair out of her face to behind her ear.

Seraya shivered from the gentle touch and opened her eyes. &quot;Lina-san...?&quot;
Lina smiled down at her and climbed under the blanket, nearly on top of
the healer. &quot;Lina-san, what...??&quot;

The sorceress gently caressed Ser&#39;s face, fingertips tracing small
circles over her pale skin. Ser closed her eyes, tilting her face into
Lina&#39;s hand. Lina smiled darkly and leaned down, kissing Ser&#39;s cheek,
corner of her lips brushing over the healer&#39;s. &quot;Isn&#39;t this what you
wanted, Seraya-chan?&quot;

Ser opened her eyes again, sensing something wrong still. Before she
could concentrate on figuring it out, though, Lina&#39;s hand sliding down
over her chest and stomach made electricity shoot through her. Ser gasped
and shivered slightly. &quot;Lina-san, I... I&#39;ve never...&quot; She blushed and
trembled slightly, Lina&#39;s hand had slipped under her shirt and was
resting on her stomach.

&quot;You&#39;ve never been touched like this before, Ser-chan?&quot; She shook her
head and gasped again, Lina was slowly pulling her shirt off. &quot;Or has
Xelloss been the only one privileged enough?&quot; Lina smiled, a dark shadowy
smile as she tossed Ser&#39;s shirt aside then leaned down again, kissing her
neck softly.

It felt so good, Lina&#39;s warmth over her. Seraya blushed though, she
wasn&#39;t used to being half-nude in front of anyone. Lina kept kissing her
neck gently, her hand on Ser&#39;s stomach slowly sliding upward over the
smooth skin. Ser blushed and moaned quietly when Lina cupped her breast
in one hand, slowly kneading the warm flesh.

The red head whispered into her ear, &quot;You&#39;re mine, Ser-chan,&quot; then
playfully nibbled her ear lobe, accenting the point by flicking one of
Ser&#39;s nipples with her thumb. The small tip of flesh stiffened and Ser
arched her back slightly, moaning quietly again. Lina&#39;s touch felt so
good, but she could still faintly sense something wrong.

Lina grinned after seeing Ser&#39;s reaction. &quot;Yes, all mine,&quot; she repeated,
slipping her hand back down Ser&#39;s stomach and tracing the waistband of
her pants. &quot;I want all of you, Ser-chan.&quot; Ser opened her eyes wide,
feeling Lina&#39;s hand slipping under her clothing and between her legs.

&quot;Lina-san..!&quot; Lina clapped her free hand over Ser&#39;s mouth, resting the
first directly over Ser&#39;s womanhood. She blushed deeply and moaned
louder, the sound muffled. Lina grinned darkly at the blond girl, fingers
gently increasing their tempo within her. Conflicting emotions raced
through Ser&#39;s mind, and the nagging feeling that something was wrong got
stronger.

Resisting against the growing sensation from Lina&#39;s movements inside her,
Ser reached up and tried to pull the hand away from her mouth. &quot;Lina...
Lina, please stop...!&quot; Ignoring her protests, Lina only increased her
speed more. Ser trembled and moaned again, she couldn&#39;t hold back much
longer.

&quot;Lina, please stop...&quot; Her eyes were glowing softly but also paled
slightly.

&quot;That&#39;s not what you really want... You like this, Ser-chan.&quot; Lina smiled
evilly, her victim&#39;s physical reaction was simply making it easier.

&quot;It&#39;s wrong, Lina please...! What&#39;s happened.. t...&quot; Ser&#39;s eyes flashed
brightly a moment and she cried out weakly, drenching Lina&#39;s hand. Her
voice was weak and trembled, &quot;Lina...&quot; The light in her eyes faded and
she fell unconscious, breathing heavily.

Lina smiled triumphantly at her prey and wrapped an arm around her,
laying down next to Ser. &quot;You&#39;re mine, Ser-chan,&quot; she whispered before
she fell asleep, still half on top of the young healer.

Across the fireplace, two pairs of blue eyes watched the girls sleep, as
they had been for a while now. On the opposite side, in the shadows, a
pair of purple eyes glowed lightly with its own pain and anger, then
vanished.

Still a fourth pair of eyes watched as well, but couldn&#39;t be seen, nor
the evil grin its owner had. &quot;The spell was a success, my Lord. When I
deactivate it, Lina Inverse will be easily defeated.&quot; The shadowy figure
waved its hand, dispelling the predation/seduction spell that had been
cast on the sorceress. Then it disappeared, low laughter riding the
breeze.
