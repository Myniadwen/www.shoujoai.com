<h1>Curses and Control (part 11 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hawk.html">Hawk Shadowharper</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../slayers/curses-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>The room was organized chaos. All of the kingdom&#39;s healers and priests
were there, trying their best to help the comatose chimera, but their
efforts were quickly becoming useless.

Ser looked around, mentally assessing the power in the room. &lt;All of them
combined... the same level as one of my simplier healing spells.&gt; &quot;I think
I can help him, but I need quiet to concentrate,&quot; she whispered to
Amelia. The princess nodded and tried to get the group&#39;s attention.

&quot;Excuse me... uhm, could I have your attention, please... please,
everyone...&quot;

&quot;EVERYONE, SHUT UP!!&quot; The room went deathly silent for a moment as
everyone looked at the small sorceress with the big mouth. Lina eyed the
other white magic users. &quot;Get outta here, we&#39;ve got a professional.&quot; She
nodded towards Ser as the blond walked towards Zel.

Most of the older healers huffed at such a young girl possibly having
more powerful magic then them. &quot;Well, believe it, so either get out or be
quiet.&quot; The majority grumbled and left, while the rest asked to stay and
watch.

Ser nodded absently, looking down at Zel. She recognized the attack and
knew how to heal it, but her energy was still low. &lt;I have to do this,
Zel-san needs me...&gt; Closing her eyes, she started to chant lowly, an orb
of white healing energy slowly forming between her hands.

As the others watched, Zel&#39;s wounded started, very slowly, to heal. The
priests that were left were amazed, while the other slayers were hopeful.

Ser trembled, her physical energy running low quickly. &lt;No, I have to do
this, I have to save him...!&gt; Her mental and magical energy pushed her
body farther as the orb grew larger, the spell almost complete. &lt;Save him,
I can save him... I have to, he&#39;s counting on me.&gt;

Seraya&#39;s vision blurred as she started getting dizzy but kept chanting,
the white orb glowing. She gasped out the last incantation and collapsed
into Xel&#39;s waiting arms. The orb drifted slowly down into Zel, and the
rest of his injuries healed almost instantly.

The other slayers, who had seen healings like this before, were
respectful about it. Amelia and the other healers were absolutely
floored. &quot;That was...&quot; &quot;Incredible...&quot; &quot;I&#39;ve never seen anything like
it...&quot;

&quot;Xel-chan,&quot; the young girl whispered weakly, eyes closed. Xel smiled
lightly down at her.

&quot;Yes, Ser-chan?&quot;

&quot;Zel... how is he?&quot;

&quot;Completely healed... thanks to you.&quot; Ser sighed in relief and relaxed in
his arms.

&quot;Thank L-sama...&quot;

&quot;Seraya-sama, that was amazing!&quot; The princess was suddenly standing
there, sparkles in her eyes. &quot;You must stay and join us under the banner
of Justice to fight against the evils of illness and injury!&quot; Xel
cringed, cradling Ser protectively.

&quot;Amelia, she needs rest, it&#39;s been a long day.&quot; She blinked a couple
times.

&quot;Oh... gomen, Seraya-sama, I&#39;ll talk to you later.&quot; Xel sighed in relief
of his own and teleported back to where Ser had been resting, then laid
her down gently again.

&quot;Rest, Ser-chan..&quot; He lightly brushed a strand of golden hair out of her
face. &lt;You deserve it after the day you&#39;ve had.&gt; He smiled warmly and
leaned down, kissing her lightly. Then he disappeared again.
