<a href="../slayers/curses-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>The next morning, the palace cooks had their hands full, trying to feed
their normal number plus Lina and Gourry. The group of bandit slayers,
including Amelia were seated around a table, enjoying a feast of all the
breakfast foods you could imagine.

&quot;How are you feeling, Zel-san,&quot; Ser asked quietly. He looked up from his
coffee at her.

&quot;Much better now... thank you, Seraya.&quot; She smiled softly.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; She started to say something else when someone caught
her eye. Seated at the farthest corner from her was Lina, trying to avoid
her gaze. Deciding not to wait any longer, Ser stood and walked around
the table to beside the sorceress. &quot;Lina-san...?&quot;

Lina looked up with a start, then looked away, still ashamed about what
she did. &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry, Ser-san...&quot; The healer watched her a moment.

&quot;Lina-san... can we talk...? Privately?&quot; Lina looked back up at Ser, a
little surprised but nodded. Ser lead her out of the dining room, all
eyes at the table on the two girls.

Ser lead Lina to a little-used back hallway, and stopped when they
couldn&#39;t hear the noise from breakfast anymore. Ser looked back at Lina,
eyes glowing lightly in the dim hallway. The red head looked down, still
feeling bad.

&quot;Lina-san... Lina-san, look at me.&quot; Slowly she looked up again. &quot;I don&#39;t
blame you for what happened... so you shouldn&#39;t blame yourself either.
Zur is powerful, and... and it was his spell, not you.&quot; Lina blushed
softly, memories of the night flooding back to her.

Seraya smiled at the sorceress and leaned back against the wall behind
her. &quot;Lina-san... would you think less of me if I... I admitted I liked
it?&quot; Lina&#39;s eyes widened, slightly in shock but mostly in surprise.

&quot;Y... you did...?&quot; Ser&#39;s eyes glowed brighter as she nodded.

&quot;Hai, I did, Lina-san...&quot; Lina stared at her, not really sure what to do.
&lt;She.. she liked what we did...? L-sama, how can I tell her I did too...&gt;
Coming to a decision, Lina stepped closer to the blond girl. Ser stared
back, a little nervous and hopeful.

Lina reached up with both hands and took a gentle hold of Ser&#39;s face,
looking into her eyes. Ser stared back, eyes shining brightly. The red
head leaned forward slowly and lightly brushed her lips over Ser&#39;s,
closing her eyes. The healer shivered slightly and wrapped her arms
gently around Lina&#39;s waist, pulling her closer.

The two girls kissed softly, enjoying each other&#39;s touch. Never had
either young woman felt so safe or accepted. What seemed like hours
later, Lina gently broke the kiss and opened her eyes. Ser shivered and
opened her&#39;s as well. They stared into each other&#39;s eyes a few more
moments, blue and red.

&quot;Did you enjoy that too, Ser-chan...?&quot; She smiled and hugged Lina
tightly, resting her head on Lina&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Hai, I did Lina-chan... thank you...&quot; Lina smiled lightly, stroking
Ser&#39;s hair.

&quot;You&#39;re most welcome...&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Are you sure you won&#39;t stay and teach us, Seraya-sama?&quot; Zel groaned and
shook his head, Amelia was still trying to convince Ser to stay at
Sailoon and teach their healers more powerful spells. Ser never changed
her minds, though, she wanted to travel with the slayers.

&quot;Unless you traveled with us, Ame-san and I taught you, then you could
come back and teach the other healers.&quot; Amelia&#39;s eyes turned starry.

&quot;You would do that? Domo arigato, Seraya-sama!&quot; The princess hugged Ser
enthusiastically, causing her to blush. The other slayers sighed
collectively.

&quot;So where are we going again,&quot; Gourry asked as the five headed out of the
palace.

&quot;Malfia, of course, where we were headed before this whole thing
started,&quot; Lina answered then started down the road, her friends behind
her.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

He chuckled lowly. &quot;I will get her back... perhaps not very soon, but I
will get her back... and by that time you&#39;ll not be able to protect
her...&quot;
