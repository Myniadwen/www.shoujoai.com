<a href="../slayers/curses-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>&quot;Who was that, m&#39;Lord?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about them, my dear, they won&#39;t find us.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;I&#39;ll go find Ser-chan, you three... well, just survive,&quot; stated the
self-proclaimed Mazoku leader.

&quot;Wait, how will you find her?&quot;

&quot;Same way I found her before,&quot; and he disappeared. Granite narrowed his
eyes, several orbs of dark energy forming and rotating around him.

&quot;He is a fool, Lord Zur will destroy him in an instant.&quot; One of the orbs
flew towards the remaining slayers and they dived aside, an explosion of
black energy being set off.

Lina jumped back to her feet and yelled out angrily, several spells
flying from her hands towards Granite. Her jaw hit the ground when he
simply waved his hand, all of her attacks disappating in thin air.
&quot;Dammit!&quot;

Zel wasn&#39;t standing idle, he was running for a position behind the dark
figure. However, his spells found the same demise, becoming useless
before they even got close to their target. &quot;Alright, spells don&#39;t seem
to be an option. Gourry, get the Sword of Light!&quot;

The swordsman nodded and held up the hilt of his sword, the white blade
sliding out and glowing brightly for a moment. Granite yelled in pain and
threw another energy orb at the sword, knocking it out of Gourry&#39;s hands.
It disappeared into the shadows, the white glow dimmed severely.

&quot;Light! Gourry, go get the sword back! Zel, let&#39;s light the place up!&quot;
Granite, seeing what was coming, roared and threw all of the black orbs
in both directions. Lina avoided most of them but one slammed into her,
sending her back and smashing into a &quot;wall&quot; that formed suddenly. The
sorceress crumpled to the ground, gasping for breath.

Zel met much the same fate, but he recovered almost right away and threw
several Lighting spells. The shadowy figured howled and thew larger orbs
at the chimera. Zel wasn&#39;t so lucky this time.

&quot;ZEL!&quot; After she recovered and pushed back to her feet, Lina saw him
disappear into the darkness behind a large black orb. The Lighting spells
were quickly enveloped by more orbs and disappeared. &quot;Enough playing
around!&quot; Lina chanted quickly, a very bright light forming between her
hands. By this time Gourry had recovered his sword and was running back,
weapon raised. &quot;Gourry! Slice him to bits!&quot;

The swordsman dove for Granite, the sword&#39;s holy blade sinking deep into
the shadow. A scream of anger and inhuman pain escaped the evil&#39;s lips,
and his disappeared from around the sword. Not wasting time in
congratulations, Lina rushed off in the direction Zel disappeared.

&quot;Zel! ZEL!!&quot; The shadows were like a fog, and when she finally did reach
him she nearly tripped over him. Then she got a good look at him.&quot;... oh
L-sama...&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Xelloss peered at the darkness where he knew his target was. &quot;If you come
out now Zur, I might only kill you.&quot;

&quot;My, quite a threat from such a weak creature.&quot; Xel&#39;s eyes narrowed
angrily.

&quot;And you&#39;re such an arrogant one.&quot; He held up his staff, energy starting
to swirl around the jewel.

&quot;Now now, Mettallium, is it a good idea to attack while I hold Seraya
right next to me?&quot;

&lt;Shimatta!&gt; &quot;Let her go, Zur!&quot; The shadow chuckled quietly.

&quot;Certainly.&quot; Xel binked in surprise at the response and Ser walked out of
the shadows, her eyes with the same blank look.

&quot;Ser-chan...?&quot; She smiled weakly, her eyes starting to glow lightly.

&quot;We wish to be left alone,&quot; she whispered just before she fired a large
beam of white energy at the Trickster.

The moment that he let his guard down was she she was waiting for, the
white light digging into his body and sending massive waves of pain
through him.

&quot;AAHH!! Seraya, stop!!&quot; Trying to concentrate but finding it nearly
impossible, Xel had no choice but to teleport away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Well done, my dear, but he will be back.&quot;

&quot;I understand, my Lord.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lina cradled Zel&#39;s head in her lap. He was unconscious from the earlier
attack, painful burns all over his blue skin. &quot;Zel... Zel, please don&#39;t
leave me!&quot; Lina trembled, a single tear sliding down her cheek.

Gourry was standing protectively beside them, Sword of Light illuminating
the area as he expected Granite to reappear for a second round.

When someone teleported near, he tensed, ready to slice the shadow to
pieces this time. &quot;Put that down, Gou-san, it&#39;s blinding.&quot; Lina looked up
and gaped in surprise, the Mazoku was in much the same condition as Zel.

&quot;What happened to you?!&quot; He kneeled in front of her, looking down at Zel.

&quot;Sore wa himitsu desu, Lina-chan,&quot; he answered quietly. &quot;What happened to
Zel-kun?&quot;

&quot;Granite hit him with dark energy. He... he&#39;s dying...&quot; Xel closed his
eyes and sighed silently.

&quot;He is... we need Ser-chan&#39;s help to heal him.&quot;

&quot;Where is Seraya,&quot; Gourry asked.

&quot;... Still under Zur&#39;s control.&quot; &lt;And becoming quite an opponent&gt;, he added
mentally.
