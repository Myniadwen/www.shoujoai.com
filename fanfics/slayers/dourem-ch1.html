<h1>Do You Remember?</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dragonhealer.html">Dragonhealer</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;You call that a flare arrow?  Oh, for the love of Ceipheid, how many 
times must we go through this?&quot;  Lina&#39;s loud and frustrated voice 
could be heard within a three-mile radius.  

A large sweatdrop appeared on Sylphiel&#39;s head.  &quot;But Lina, I am doing 
the best that I can,&quot; she said with a nervous smile.  Nearby, Gourry, 
Amelia and Zelgadis were patiently sitting on a huge boulder, 
watching.  Gourry was cleaning his sword.

Sylphiel had asked Lina to give her lessons on improving her attack 
spells.  It was a bright and crispy afternoon, so the timing was 
perfect.  They had settled on an empty field just a few miles from 
Sairaag.  However, they were not making a lot of progress.  After 
several attempts, where Sylphiel&#39;s flare arrows were nothing more than 
sparkles, Lina was beginning to give up.  &quot;Just how is it that a 
shrine maiden who is able to cast the most powerful black magic spell 
like the Dragon Slave can&#39;t even cast a spell as simple as a flare 
arrow?&quot;  an exasperated Lina asked out loud.

Sylphiel looked at the young sorceress who had her head down.  Calmly 
she walked up to her.  She gently placed a hand on her shoulder.  
&quot;Lina, may I show you my fireball?  I have been practicing, really.&quot;  

Lina looked up at Sylphiel&#39;s pretty face.  She sighed.  &quot;Oh, all 
right.  But don&#39;t forget that we still need to work on your flare 
arrow,&quot; she said.  &quot;Now, why don&#39;t you try shooting at that boulder 
next to the one the others are on?&quot;

Sylphiel saw where she was pointing.  &quot;OK, here goes.&quot;  She closed her 
eyes and concentrated hard, getting into position.  After a few 
minutes, she yelled out, &quot;Fireball!&quot;  A huge ball of fire appeared in 
her hands and shot directly towards the boulder.  Unfortunately, she 
did not concentrate on her aiming.  

&quot;Look out!&quot;  Zelgadis shouted.  Gourry struggled to get off from the 
boulder.  Amelia casted a shield just in time.  The fireball hit the 
shield and disappeared.  Everyone looked at Sylphiel, who looked like 
she was going to faint.  She slowly turned her head towards a flaming 
Lina.  The red-haired sorceress was starting to lose her patience.  

&quot;Sylphiel.......&quot; but before she could say anything else Sylphiel ran 
off.  &quot;Hey, where are you going?&quot;  Lina shouted.  But the shrine 
maiden refused to turn back.

Two hours later Lina and the others found Sylphiel sitting on the 
grass next to a lake.  It was getting close to sunset.  The sky was a 
bright orange.  She looked like she had been crying.  Lina walked up 
to her and sat next to her.  &quot;Hey, it&#39;s okay.  I&#39;m not mad.  We can 
try again if you want.&quot;  She looked at Sylphiel, was still staring at 
the lake.  Lina could no longer stand seeing her sad.  &quot;Come on, cheer 
up!&quot;  she said happily.  Silence.  

Lina shook her head and began to stand up when Sylphiel spoke up.  
&quot;Lina, do you remember when we fought Copy Rezo?&quot;  

Lina stopped and looked her.  &quot;Yes, why?&quot;  She noticed Sylphiel was 
shuddering.  

&quot;And.....when.....you took the hit for me......and when you fell.....&quot;  

Lina was surprised.  &quot;Sylphiel....&quot;  

Sylphiel turned to face her with tears in her eyes.  &quot;It was my fault 
that you almost died.  If I hadn&#39;t gotten in the way that never 
wouldn&#39;t have happened!&quot;

The others had come closer to the two and had overheard.  Lina was 
quiet for a minute.  She watched as Sylphiel cried.  &quot;Sylphiel, don&#39;t 
you remember what happened next?  You saved my life.&quot;  Sylphiel 
stopped crying and before she realized it, Lina was a few inches from 
her face.    &quot;I owe you so much,&quot; she said quietly, and she cupped 
Sylphiel&#39;s face and kissed her.  When it was over, Sylphiel was 
staring at her.  Lina just smiled.  &quot;Consider it a friendly kiss.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right, if it hadn&#39;t been for you, Lina would not be standing 
here comforting you.  If you weren&#39;t there we would have never been 
able to defeat Copy Rezo,&quot; Zelgadis said in a cheering voice.

&quot;Yeah, Sylphiel.  You really helped us out.&quot;  Gourry smiled.

&quot;Miss Sylphiel, I must say that I was very proud of your 
accomplishment.  You are an important member in our group,&quot; Amelia 
added.

Sylphiel smiled and wiped away her tears.  &quot;Thanks, everyone.  Lina, I 
promise I will do my best to mastering my attack spells.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the spirit!&quot;  Lina slapped Sylphiel&#39;s back hard, nearly 
knocking her over.  &quot;Now what do you say we take a break and continue 
tomorrow?  I&#39;m starving!&quot;

As the others walked back toward Sairaag, they suddenly remembered 
what Lina just did.  &quot;Lina likes girls?&quot;  Gourry asked.  

&quot;Better not think too much about it,&quot; Zelgadis said as if it had never 
happened.  

&quot;I never knew Miss Lina was that attracted to Miss Sylphiel,&quot; Amelia 
commented.

Lina, who was way behind them and did not hear their comments, looked 
back and saw that Sylphiel was still standing there.  &quot;Hey, what&#39;s up, 
Sylphiel?&quot;

&quot;What?  Oh, I&#39;m sorry.  I was just lost in my thoughts,&quot; Sylphiel 
quickly responded, flashing a quick smile.

Shaking her head, Lina reached out and pulled Sylphiel, guiding her.  
&quot;You know, girls like us are supposed to get over our sad thoughts and 
focus more on happy ones.  We&#39;re supposed to be out having fun.  Just 
enjoy the delicious food we&#39;ll be having at the inn. You&#39;ve been way 
too gentle with your spells.  It&#39;s like my sister always said, &#39;If you 
concentrate more you will be more powerful.&#39;  She taught me all the 
basic attack spells when I was only five years old back home. Take 
Amelia.  The strange thing about her is that unlike you, she could 
never master the Dragon Slave, but like you she is able to cast the 
most powerful healing spells.  It&#39;s a good thing, though, because 
you&#39;re much more mature and responsible than she is, even if she is 
Seyruun&#39;s princess.   Who knows what horrible things she could do if 
she ever learned the Dragon Slave.....&quot;

As Lina ranted on and on, concentrating on the path up ahead and 
pulling Sylphiel&#39;s hand, the shrine maiden went back to her thoughts.  
&lt;She kissed me.  She actually kissed me.  But she says it&#39;s only a 
&#39;friendly kiss&#39;.  Then why do I feel like this?  The only person whom 
I have these kinds of feelings is dear Gourry.  But Lina......she&#39;s 
different.  Dear Gourry just doesn&#39;t understand how I feel about him.  
That battle we had.....Lina took the hit for me.....when I saw her 
bleeding on the ground......it was she who saved me first.....so far 
he has not done anything like that.....do I even love dear Gourry?  Or 
is it Lina who&#39;s the object of my affection?  Oh dear.....what&#39;s 
happening to me?  Why are my feelings shifting from him to her?  She 
probably has no romantic feelings for dear Gourry.  He&#39;s simply her 
protector.  She even laughed when I asked her if it were true.  Lina 
Inverse......my friend.....my dear friend.....&gt;

&quot;Hello?  Anyone in here?&quot;  Lina gently knocked on Sylphiel&#39;s head.  
Sylphiel realized they had already arrived at the inn and it was 
already getting dark.  She looked into Lina&#39;s red eyes and felt 
embarrassed.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry....I was....&quot;  But Lina held up her hand.  

&quot;No offense, but you had better save it for later.  It&#39;s time to eat!&quot; 

Sylphiel watched as the usual fight between Gourry and Lina took 
place.    Zelgadis was quietly sipping tea while Amelia ate with more 
grace.  &lt;Honestly, they act like they&#39;re brother and sister than their 
actual relationship.  Maybe it&#39;s true.  Maybe I do feel more towards 
Lina.  She says she owes me for saving her life, but it should be me 
who owes her.  And I learned how to cast the Dragon Slave from her.&gt;

&quot;Miss Sylphiel?  Aren&#39;t you hungry?&quot;  Amelia politely asked.  

&quot;Oh?  Oh yes.  Excuse me.  I was just thinking.&quot;  Sylphiel decided to 
put her thoughts aside and concentrated on her meal.  She often 
wondered how she was still able to eat at the same table where Lina 
and Gourry were continuing their ravaging behavior.

&quot;What?  There are only three rooms left?&quot;  The owner of the inn nodded 
his head.  Lina sighed.  &quot;This is what happens when we get back to 
town late.&quot;  

&quot;Lina, I apologize.  You were so busy giving me lessons that we had 
lost track of time, and if I hadn&#39;t run away, we would have gotten 
here earlier, and.......&quot;

Lina was getting sick and tired of Sylphiel&#39;s tiresome apologizing.  
She turned to face Sylphiel&#39;s green eyes.  &quot;All right, that&#39;s it.  
You&#39;re sharing a room with me.  Zelgadis, you share with Gourry, and 
Amelia, you get to have the last one to yourself.  Everybody okay with 
that?&quot;  Everyone&#39;s nodding heads was more than enough for Lina to grab 
Sylphiel&#39;s hand and drag her upstairs, while the others went back to 
their business.

Inside the room, there was one large bed.  Lina sat on the bed and 
pulled Sylphiel down to her.  Frustrated red eyes met nervous green 
eyes.  After a moment of silence Lina pressed her lips firmly against 
Sylphiel&#39;s, while waving her hand.  When she broke the kiss Sylphiel 
asked, &quot;Lina, what did you just do?&quot;  Lina smirked.  

&quot;What did it look like?  I casted a silence spell outside our door.  
That way no one can hear us.&quot;

Sylphiel was surprised then relaxed.  Lina calmed down and flopped 
down on the bed, while Sylphiel began to undress.  &quot;Sylphiel, just 
what is wrong with you?  You have been acting so strange these days.  
You keep staring into space and forgetting where you are,&quot; she said as 
she stared up at the ceiling.  Sylphiel gathered her thoughts for a 
while, then hovered over the red-haired sorceress.  Lina noticed she 
was only in her underwear.  

&quot;Lina......the reason why.....it&#39;s because.....since the battle with 
Copy Rezo......I.....I never truly thanked you for saving my 
life......that kiss you gave me.....it meant much more to me.....I 
want to do something even more for you.&quot;

Lina just stared at her.  &lt;Just what is she thinking?  Is she that 
interested in me?  That would mean she&#39;s over Gourry.....oh 
wait......&gt;    She smiled.  &lt;That would be a good thing.  She deserves 
better than that baka.  Right.  We owe each other so much.  She saved 
my life.  And she&#39;s the only one who&#39;s been so caring and kind to me, 
better than the others.&gt;  &quot;Sylphiel, if that is what you truly want to 
do, then.....what did you have in mind?&quot;  Lina asked in a soft tone.  

In response, Sylphiel kissed Lina&#39;s forehead and whispered in her ear. 
Lina smiled and nodded her head.  &quot;But on one condition,&quot; she said in 
a mysterious tone.  

&quot;What is it, dear Lina?&quot;  

Lina sat up and held her knees.  &quot;We&#39;re taking a bath.  All that 
training has really taken its toll on us.  But let&#39;s not do anything 
too extreme.  I don&#39;t want Amelia to make another one of her justice 
speeches if she catches us doing anything fishy,&quot; she said with a 
wink.

Their bathtime went by without any problems.  Lina couldn&#39;t help but 
notice how perfect Sylphiel&#39;s body was.  She had never been attracted 
to another girl before.  She had bathed with Amelia once, even let her 
scrub her back, but it was nothing more than that.  &lt;It must be the 
fact that we saved each other&#39;s life.  She did so much for 
me.......sweet Ceiphied.....I can&#39;t wait to touch her body.&gt;  Lina 
thought dreamily.

When Amelia finished her bath and returned inside, Sylphiel slowly 
approached Lina from behind and encircled her arms around the 
sorceress&#39; small body. Lina could feel Sylphiel&#39;s ample breasts being 
pressed against her back.  For once she was no longer concerned about 
her own.   &quot;Dear Lina.....I love you,&quot; she whispered.   

&quot;I thought you loved Gourry,&quot; Lina spoke softly.  

&quot;I thought about it, and I realized something.  It was you whom I had 
truly loved.  You understand, don&#39;t you?&quot;  

&quot;Of course, otherwise I would have never kissed you,&quot; Lina responded, 
as she relaxed into Sylphiel&#39;s arms.  &quot;It&#39;s about time you were over 
jellyfish brains.  I knew you had more common sense than that.&quot;

In response Sylphiel gently kissed Lina&#39;s neck while her hands felt up 
Lina.  &quot;Oohhh......Sylphiel.....not now....please.....&quot;  

&quot;Of course, dear Lina.  By the way, how long will that silence spell 
last?&quot;  

&quot;As long as I want it to be,&quot; Lina responded.

It was late at night.  A bright full moon had appeared, shining 
through the window and onto the two girls.  Lina and Sylphiel sat on 
the bed, naked and facing each other. Lina leaned in and kissed 
Sylphiel passionately.  She lowered her head and kissed down her 
stomach, licking and sucking on her breasts.  Sylphiel moaned softly. 
&quot;You have no idea I have dreamed of doing this with you,&quot; she spoke 
softly in between kisses.  

&quot;As have I, dear Lina,&quot; Sylphiel responded as she pulled Lina into a 
warm hug.  Lina stopped and leaned her forehead against Sylphiel&#39;s 
breast.  

&quot;Hey, Sylphiel.  Tell me something.  Did you ever dream of doing this 
with Gourry?&quot;

Sylphiel looked down at her.  She caught the scent of Lina&#39;s hair.  
Shaking her head, she responded, &quot;No, dear Lina.  I thought he would 
never be able to satisfy me.  It took me a long time to find out who I 
truly loved.  And it&#39;s you.  You and I understand each other so much.  
I want to be with you all the time.  Lina....let me...&quot;

She lowered her head and licked inside Lina&#39;s vagina, until she found 
her clitoris. &quot;Sylphiel.......yes......right 
there......please.....oh......&quot; Lina moaned out loud.  She could feel 
intense pleasure shooting up throughout her body.  Sylphiel sucked and 
licked, savoring all the juices Lina&#39;s body was producing. 

&quot;I&#39;m glad I can please you, dear Lina.&quot;  She sat on her knees and 
kissed Lina hard.  &quot;Lina, how will the others take this?&quot; Sylphiel 
asked softly as her hands slowly entered Lina.

Lina smiled.  &quot;Gourry and the others will probably take this very 
lightly.  Knowing him, he&#39;ll probably think it&#39;s the greatest thing 
ever.  Whatever makes us happy, he&#39;s happy.  I can never forget what 
you have done for me.&quot;

Moments later......

&quot;Lina......please.....I&#39;m going to explode.....no more.....&quot; Sylphiel 
was sweating profusely.  Lina was lashing her tongue deep within 
Sylphiel&#39;s vagina.  She looked up at her.  

&quot;Are you sure?  Have you had enough?&quot;  She was too weak to respond.  
Sensing this, Lina helped her friend lay down, then lay down next to 
her. Gently stroking her body and touching her breasts, Lina watched 
as Sylphiel breathed heavily.  

After catching her breath, Sylphiel smiled.  &quot;Thank you, dear Lina.&quot;  

Lina shook her head and whispered, &quot;It&#39;s not like we can&#39;t do this 
again.  I love you, Sylphiel.  You have beautiful eyes.  I had always 
wanted to feel you, to touch you.  I.....I&#39;m sorry I hit you that 
time.  I should have known it was only an accident.&quot;

Sylphiel thought for a moment, then she remembered.  &quot;It&#39;s okay.  I 
should have been more careful.&quot;

Lina reached out and gently stroked Sylphiel&#39;s pretty face.  &quot;Why 
don&#39;t we turn in?  We still have to work on your lessons tomorrow.&quot;  
Sylphiel smiled and closed her eyes.Lina put her arm around her 
sleeping friend and fell asleep with a smile.</pre>
