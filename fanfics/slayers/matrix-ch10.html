<h1>The Slayers Matrix (part 10 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hawk.html">Hawk Shadowharper</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../slayers/matrix-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>           His sunglasses hide the fact his eyes are wide, ogling the 
magazine centerfold. Phibrizio knows if he were caught with the 
special &quot;Zelas Edition&quot; he made and imported into the Matrix, he would 
be in trouble. Of course, that didn&#39;t stop him. 
           What does stop him is his cell phone ringing from where 
it&#39;s resting on the table beside his chair. He scrambles to close the 
full-length image of his girl in white and answers. On the other end 
he hears Hawk&#39;s voice informing him, &quot;They&#39;re on their way.&quot; 

           The black car rolls to a stop, Garv straightening from a 
crouch and clenching his automatic weapon as their crewmates return. 
Eris keeps watching down the alleyway as Xelloss and Seraya exit and 
start up the stairs to the door. Zelgadis climbs out with a smile 
unconsciously on his face and turns it on Lina as she gets out. She 
eyes the grinning man a moment then follows after Xel and Ser. Zel&#39;s 
smile fades a little. 

           On board the Dragon Slayer, the shadow of Zel&#39;s smile finds 
its way to his real mouth. 
           Hawk frowns as he watches his screens, tapping absently. 
Their location was selected because it was an abandoned part of the 
city, but today there&#39;s much more activity than there should be. &quot;What 
is that,&quot; he asks himself quietly. 

           Xelloss leads the crew up the stairs as they head for the 
thirteenth floor, Lina bringing up the rear behind Eris, Garv, 
Zelgadis and Seraya. As they reach the landing on the seventh floor, 
Lina sees a black cat in the doorway. It looks up at her with glowing 
yellow eyes, meows, then wanders out of sight. Paying it no mind, she 
continues towards the next flight of stairs until she glances back and 
she sees a black cat in the doorway. It looks up at her with glowing 
yellow eyes, meows, then wanders out of sight. 
            &quot;Whoa, d&eacute;j&agrave; vu,&quot; she comments half to herself. The others 
tense and turn towards her. 

           On the Matrix screens, the code flashes and spasms, Hawk 
watching bewildered. 

            &quot;What did you just say,&quot; Seraya asks, trying to keep her 
voice calm. 
            &quot;Nothing, just had a little d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.&quot; 
            &quot;What did you see,&quot; she presses the redhead. 
            &quot;What happened,&quot; Zel asks as well, stepping down closer to 
Lina, the others listening carefully. 
           Visibly confused by their reactions, Lina replies as she 
points back at the doorway, &quot;A black cat went past us, and then 
another that looked just like it.&quot; 
            &quot;How much like it, was it the same cat?&quot; Lina frowns in 
thought at the small blond girl. 
            &quot;It might have been; I&#39;m not sure.&quot; With that, the others 
look up towards Xelloss. He gives orders just with two words. 
            &quot;Eris, Garv.&quot; The black-haired woman draws her gun, 
climbing quickly up to the next landing to watch the eighth floor 
corridor. Garv moves down to where Lina is, keeping an eye on the 
doorway where the black cat was. 
           Seeing what their reactions are this time, Lina asks Ser, 
&quot;What is it?&quot; 
            &quot;A d&eacute;j&agrave; vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix. It happens 
when they change something,&quot; she answers, looking up in the space 
between the stairs. 

           Phibrizio looks up to the ceiling as he wanders back into 
the room where Lina swallowed the red pill. He&#39;s carrying one of the 
crates that came with the crew. Overhead, a helicopter flies by. 

           Hawk&#39;s eyes widen as he reads the code after it&#39;s settled. 
&quot;Oh my God...&quot; 

           Deep in the basement, a pair of heavy bolt cutters slices 
apart the main telephone connection for the entire building. 

           Hearing the same helicopter his young friend did, Xelloss 
calls to the others, &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; before starting to run up with the 
rest following his lead. 

           Phibrizio&#39;s phone rings and he quickly answers it. 

           &quot;They cut the hard line, it&#39;s a trap! Get out,&quot; Hawk says 
urgently. 

           The crate drops from Phibrizio&#39;s hand and he dashes with a 
stumble over to the window, pulling the curtains open. All he sees is 
solid brick. He pushes against it, and he feels solid brick as well. 
&quot;Oh no...&quot; 

            &quot;Oh no,&quot; agrees their operator. 

           Phibrizio hurriedly pulls open the crate, and from among 
all the handguns, heavy weapons and ammo, pulls out a small cloth bag 
of marbles. Unlike the rest of the crew that uses direct magic spells 
to fight, the youngest crewmember uses small enchanted marbles that 
when broken, disrupts an RSI&#39;s carrier signal. For every single marble 
he breaks, a person he&#39;s looking at dies. 
           A team of heavily armored and armed military personnel 
creeps down the hall towards the room Phibby is in. At a silent 
command, one kicks the door down and they begin to spray weapons fire 
inside. They&#39;re greeted with Phibrizio, who has a handful of golden 
marbles. He grins and crushes them. 

           Xelloss pauses in the stairwell at the sounds of gunfire, 
looking up. 

           The initial team of cops goes down but they brought backup 
and before the young man can pull out more marbles, bullets slam into 
him. He shouts as he manages to break one more marble then collapses 
against the bricked-up window, pulling the curtains down on top of 
him. 

           On the Dragon Slayer, Phibrizio&#39;s body shakes and spasms 
with each bullet hit. He then goes still, blood dribbling from his 
mouth. The life monitor sounds a warning buzzer before flat lining. 
The youngest crewmember is dead. Hawk shuts his eyes tightly. 

           The ground floor doors burst open, another squad of police 
officers swarming in. Most start up the stairs while the rest start 
searching for their targets. Xelloss looks down several floors at 
those armed men filling the building. He looks back to his crewmembers 
then they start running again, Garv taking up the rear. Eris watches 
the stairwell for anyone following then goes jogging after Garv. 
           Xelloss stops at the first window and pulls the curtains 
open, discovering the brick wall instead. Zelgadis sees and panics, 
saying, &quot;Ohh, that&#39;s what they changed. We&#39;re trapped, there&#39;s no way 
out!&quot; Xel looks thoughtfully down the hallway they just came from, 
Garv and Eris on lookout as they keep an eye for any cops or Agents. 
            &quot;Be calm,&quot; he says soothingly to Zel, &quot;Give me your 
phone.&quot; The lavender-haired man reaches into his pocket and comes up 
empty. At the same time, Seraya opens her own phone and hands it to 
Xelloss. 
            &quot;They&#39;ll be able to track it,&quot; she warns as she crosses 
her hands behind her back, looking down one of the hallways. 
            &quot;We have no choice,&quot; Xel replies as he dials. 

           Hawk holds a hand over his headset, opening his eyes and 
tearing his gaze away from Phibrizio&#39;s body. &quot;Operator,&quot; he answers 
Xel&#39;s call. 
            &quot;Hawk, find a structural drawing of this building. Find it 
fast,&quot; Xelloss adds, unnecessarily as Hawk&#39;s already finding and 
loading it up. 

           More police officers fill the building, climbing up the 
stairs quickly. 

           The blueprints of the building appear on one of Hawk&#39;s 
screens. &quot;Got it!&quot; 
            &quot;I need the main wet wall.&quot; The green-eyed man nods as he 
taps to the page of the blueprints his leader needs, flipping to page 
eight. 

           Agent Valgarv looks at Phibrizio&#39;s body, faint smirk on his 
face. Suddenly something catches his attention and he holds a hand 
over his earphone. &quot;Eighth floor.&quot; 

           Agent Filia looks up from the bottom of the stairs; she 
holds her hand over her own earphone as she hears Valgarv say, 
&quot;They&#39;re on the eighth floor.&quot; 

           Xelloss listens to Hawk&#39;s directions and points, &quot;Eris, 
straight ahead.&quot; The crew follows the white-clad woman. 

           The search continues, cops swarming higher and all over the 
building. 

           Xelloss keeps the phone to his ear as they open the double 
doors to another room, Eris sweeping around with her handgun. &quot;Now 
left, that&#39;s it,&quot; Hawk finishes his instructions. Xelloss looks and 
opens the door, revealing a bathroom. 
            &quot;Good.&quot; He hangs up, returning the phone to Seraya. 

           Agent Valgarv and Agent Filia&#39;s search teams converge in 
the hallway where Xelloss started his call. She glances around then 
asks, &quot;Where are they?&quot; 

           One of the cops enters the eighth floor bathroom, 
flashlight sweeping around. He doesn&#39;t give much thought to the hole 
in the wall. Deep inside the bowels of the building, Xelloss shushes 
his team, and then indicates for them to keep crawling down after the 
officer leaves. 

           On the sixth floor another cop searches a bathroom, 
flashlight reflecting off the dusty tiles. 

           One of Xelloss&#39; steps on a pipe sends a shower of dust 
raining down on the others, catching Zelgadis right in the face. He 
coughs weakly. 

           At the sound, the cop&#39;s flashlight focuses on the back 
wall, slowly stepping towards it. 

           Zel holds a hand over his mouth, coughing again. The others 
listen tensely, trying not to breathe and cause more noise. 

           The cop lowers his weapon a bit, leaning towards the wall 
and listening. 

           Zelgadis sneezes. 

            &quot;They&#39;re in the walls,&quot; the officer says to himself, 
backing away. 

           Lina listens intently, hearing &quot;they&#39;re in the walls&quot; being 
called before gunfire starts to pierce through the wall, lances of 
light filling the tiny space. 
            &quot;Lina,&quot; Seraya cries and pushes her out of the way from 
below. 
            &quot;Go!&quot; Xelloss shouts and the crew goes deeper, climbing 
faster. Broken plaster and dust starts to fill the small area. 

           The cop keeps spraying bullets all over the wall then 
suddenly stops, eyes wide. He looks down at five claws that pierced 
his chest, then he collapses when they retract. Valgarv glares at the 
bloodied body as his hand returns to normal. &quot;Are orders that hard to 
follow? I said Xelloss must be taken alive.&quot; He purposely steps on the 
corpse as he goes to the bullet hole-covered wall, looking in and 
realizing where Xelloss is taking them. &quot;How like a rodent.&quot; 

           On the fourth floor, another cop busts down part of the 
wall with his rifle, &quot;I got him! I got him!&quot; Instead, Seraya fires 
from above and he retreats back to the hallway. She continues to climb 
down quickly, blond hair briefly visible before the cop&#39;s fist punches 
through the hole and grabs a handful of her golden locks. Gritting her 
teeth, Lina kicks through the hole hard and catches the cop in the 
chin, causing him to stagger back. Blue eyes lock on red for a moment 
then they continue climbing. 
           At the bottom, Garv and Eris kick out the protective screen 
and drop into the basement. 
           Immediately they come under fire, a squad of police wearing 
gas masks waiting in ambush for them. Garv opens fire, machine gun 
rapidly taking down the three cops on the right side. Eris stands 
beside him, shooting exactly two bullets each into the heads of the 
three cops on the left side. Zelgadis, Seraya, Lina and Xelloss drop 
into view soon after. 
           Gas canisters bounce around and start to spray out their 
contents. Tear gas. Xelloss doesn&#39;t stop moving, looking around the 
floor then kneeling to pry open a grate. He looks up as the others 
drop in and waves to indicate to Zel to jump in as well, &quot;Zelgadis! 
Come on!&quot; He hesitates before leaving the safety of the wall then 
trips, collapsing and disappearing into the clouds of gas. Xelloss 
frowns but jumps in after the others. 

--- 

           Deep below the building, the crew makes their way through 
the sewers, Xelloss whispering to his right hand woman. &quot;You have to 
get Lina out. That&#39;s all that matters now.&quot; He stops and looks up 
towards a manhole cover. 
            &quot;Xelloss, don&#39;t.&quot; Seraya starts to protest and he looks 
back at her. 
            &quot;She must get out, you understand me?&quot; Reluctantly, the 
blond girl nods. 

           In front of the building, Zelgadis is led to the police 
van, hands cuffed behind him. 

           Shouts of &quot;they went this way&quot; echo in the sewers. Xelloss 
waits until a flashlight catches him standing at the foot of the 
ladder towards the road above. &quot;There he is!&quot; He smirks then jumps, 
trench coat spreading open behind him as he flies up, taking the 
manhole cover with him. The cops give chase. 
           Unseen, Seraya leads the Dragon Slayer crewmembers further 
away, dragging Lina after her by the hand. 

           Valgarv turns from the van pulling away and smirks again 
when Xelloss lands, holding the manhole cover. &quot;The great Xelloss... 
we meet at last.&quot; 
            &quot;And you are,&quot; the Resistance leader asks, narrowing his 
purple eyes. 
            &quot;Valgarv. Agent Valgarv.&quot; 
            &quot;Humph. You all look the same to me.&quot; 
            &quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for this moment,&quot; Valgarv says smugly 
before his head whips to the side, Xelloss having given him a hard 
right hook. 
            &quot;Oh, so have I.&quot; The Dragon grins coldly. 

           Seraya pushes a manhole cover aside several streets away 
and glances around before climbing up, reaching down to help Lina up. 
Watching the others start to come up, she pulls out her cell phone and 
looks at it dripping water. &quot;We need a new phone.&quot; 

            &quot;That&#39;s impossible,&quot; a cop notes as he looks up. He&#39;s been 
seeing a lot of impossible things lately. 
           Xelloss uses the manhole cover like a shield as he runs up 
the side of the building. Valgarv chases him, launching balls of fire 
that keep being absorbed by the glowing metal. When he reaches the top 
Xelloss jumps up into the air and spins, throwing the cover down at 
the Dragon like a 300-pound Frisbee. 
           Valgarv leaps out of the way, up towards Xelloss and his 
fingers extend out as claws. Xel kicks at them and falls down towards 
the roof, launching icicles back at Val. The rebel skids to a stop at 
the edge of the roof and looks around. His enemy is missing. Staying 
alert, he prepares another round of magic attacks when a fist punches 
through the roof and grabs his ankle. 
           Xel staggers but kicks at the Agent&#39;s hand a few times, 
running again when he gets loose. Val jumps through from below and 
chases once more. Xelloss leaps off the roof and turns in midair, 
starting to fall and throwing more balls of fire up at Valgarv. The 
Dragon dives towards his opponent, deflecting the attacks with magic 
shots of his own. When they get near the road&#39;s surface, Valgarv grabs 
Xel by the collar and slows their descent so they don&#39;t become chunky 
salsa on the ground. 
            &quot;You can&#39;t win,&quot; Val mutters through gritted teeth, which 
only makes Xelloss smile. 
            &quot;I already have.&quot; With a quiet growl, he&#39;s pushed away by 
the Agent but doesn&#39;t continue the fight. 
            &quot;Take him.&quot; Following the Agent&#39;s order, the cops swarm 
over Xelloss. 

            &quot;No,&quot; Hawk says sorrowfully as he reaches towards the 
screen, as if to pull Xelloss away from the Dragons and the police.
