<a href="../slayers/curses-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The next morning, the four travelers were walking along the road towards
a city they knew was just a couple days away. &quot;Where are we headed
again,&quot; Gourry asked for the 20th time. Lina sighed quietly, having given
up for the moment on smacking the swordsman upside the head.

&quot;We&#39;ve heard about some sort of magic artifact collection being displayed
in Malfia. It&#39;s worth a look,&quot; Lina answered, taking great effort to keep
her anger in check.

&quot;Who knows what might be in there, maybe even a cure finally.&quot; Zel
glanced around at the others and frowned slightly. Ser had a disturbed
expression on her face and seemed to be looking off into space, not
paying attention to where she was going.

&quot;Seraya?&quot; He became concerned when she didn&#39;t even acknowledge hearing
him and tried again. &quot;Seraya-san?&quot; She blinked a couple times, apparently
dragging herself out of wherever her mind was and looked at Zel, eyes
still partially distracted.

&quot;Hai...?&quot;

&quot;Is there something wrong,&quot; he asked. Ser slowed her pace then stopped
all together, looking at the forests around the road they were on.

&quot;I... I keep thinking I sense something...&quot; Zel frowned more and stopped
as well, looking around. &lt;We don&#39;t know a lot about her powers...&gt;

&quot;What do you sense, Seraya?&quot; She concentrated a moment, trying to get a
definate feel of whatever was itching at her powers.

&quot;I... I&#39;m not sure... but what it is, it&#39;s dark,&quot; she replied quietly.
Zel drew his sword and eyed the shadows of the forest, expecting some
type of attack. Lina and Gourry, at the sound of a sword being
unsheathed, stopped and looked back.

&quot;Zel? What&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;Seraya senses something, and I&#39;m more than a little suspicious.&quot;

Hidden from view of the travelers, a shadowy figure watched them,
concerned a bit. &lt;The girl shouldn&#39;t sense me at all, yet she did.
Interesting...&gt; Figuring it best to follow its Lord&#39;s orders and get back
to report, it chanted quietly and threw the invisible curse at Lina.

When the spell reached Lina, she felt dizzy a moment and closed her eyes,
trying to regain her balance. The shadow smiled darkly, already her fate
had been sealed. The spell it had used was an interesting one, and
whoever the sorceress saw first would become her target.

After taking a couple steadying breaths, Lina opened her eyes again and
there was a brief flash of darkness in her eyes. &quot;Seraya-san,&quot; she
whispered to herself.

Ser blinked and trembled slightly, sensing a very strong black spell
being cast and brushing near her, then it was gone along with whatever it
was she sensed earlier. &quot;It... it&#39;s gone.&quot; She sighed and shook her head.
&quot;I felt a spell being cast, then... nothing.&quot;

&quot;Well, whatever it is, it&#39;s gone now. Come on, Malfia awaits!&quot; Zel
watched Lina as she walked towards him and Ser, then blinked in surprise
when the sorceress wrapped an arm around the healer&#39;s waist. &quot;What are
you looking at, come on!&quot; She started down the road again, a blushing
Seraya having little choice other than walking beside the red head.

Zel blinked again, then started after the girls, Gourry falling into step
beside him. &quot;That is... unusual.&quot; The swordsman looked at Zel, wondering
what he meant but decided not to ask.

Meanwhile, Ser was having a tough time thinking with Lina&#39;s arm around
her. Add to that, Lina&#39;s fingers were lightly caressing her stomach,
making the blond girl shiver slightly. &lt;Lina-san, what are you doing...?&gt;

When she got partially used to the gentle touch, Ser took a deep breath
and tried sensing anything unusual. &lt;What is that...? It feels a little
like earlier...&gt; She couldn&#39;t concentrate enough to figure out much else.
