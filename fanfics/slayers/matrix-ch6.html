<h1>The Slayers Matrix (part 6 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hawk.html">Hawk Shadowharper</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../slayers/matrix-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>           Time is difficult to keep track of in constant darkness. 
However, the next morning the lights come on across the Dragon Slayer. 
Lina glances up from where she&#39;s been sitting all night then over at 
the door when the handle is turned from the outside. In peeks a pair 
of emerald eyes. &quot;Morning! Did you sleep?&quot; Lina shakes her head as the 
black-haired young man steps into the room. &quot;You will tonight, I 
guarantee it.&quot; He smiles as he steps in, shaking Lina&#39;s hand. &quot;I&#39;m 
Hawk, I&#39;ll be your operator.&quot; 
           &quot;You don&#39;t... you don&#39;t have any,&quot; Lina starts, noting the 
lack of plugs on the man&#39;s arms. 
           &quot;Holes? Nope. Me and my brother Gourry, we&#39;re both 100% 
pure old-fashioned home-grown human, born free right here in the real 
world,&quot; Hawk smiles as he explains to Lina, &quot;A genuine child of 
Sairaag.&quot; 
           &quot;Sairaag?&quot; 
           &quot;If the war was over tomorrow, Sairaag&#39;s where the party 
would be,&quot; Hawk replies with a chuckle. 
           &quot;It&#39;s a city?&quot; The operator nods, smile fading a bit as his 
expression turns more somber. 
           &quot;The last human city, the only place we have left.&quot; 
           &quot;Where is it,&quot; Lina asks curiously. She remembered the 
images of death all over the planet, wondering where there might still 
be life. 
           &quot;Underground, near the Earth&#39;s core where it&#39;s still warm. 
If you live long enough, you may just get to see it,&quot; he adds with a 
small grin. &quot;Goddamn, I got to tell you... I&#39;m fairly excited to see 
what you&#39;re capable of, if Xelloss is right and all. We&#39;re not 
supposed to talk about this but... if you are, it&#39;s a very exciting 
time.&quot; Hawk&#39;s green eyes glow with energy, which brings comfort to 
Lina that even in this dead world, one can still be so vibrant. &quot;We 
got a lot to do, we got to get to it,&quot; he finishes as he tugs Lina off 
her bed. 

--- 

           Lina watches from her chair, already plugged in. Hawk 
shuffles through a series of data discs, mumbling, &quot;Now, we&#39;re 
supposed to start with these operation programs first... That&#39;s major 
boring shit,&quot; he comments with a grin, &quot;let&#39;s do something a little 
more fun. How about... magic training,&quot; he asks, holding up the first 
of a series of discs. He then bursts out laughing when he sees Lina&#39;s 
blank expression, sliding the disc into the drive. 
           She isn&#39;t sure if she heard right. Magic training? What in 
the world did that mean? Thoughtful, she looks up at the control 
screen Hawk had swung around so she could watch. On the loading 
portion underneath her vital signs, the word FIREBALL appears in bold 
letters and a progress bar starts to fill. &quot;Fireball?&quot; She looks back 
at the operator. &quot;I&#39;m going to learn... fireball?&quot; Hawk winks as he 
taps at his keyboards, then selects Lina&#39;s link and presses the load 
button. 
           The woman clenches her eyes shut, whole body tensing up, as 
her mind is assaulted with information it can barely comprehend. She 
catches a glimpse of the ball of fire forming in her hand within her 
mind&#39;s eye when the upload completes, Lina gasping for breath. &quot;Holy 
shit!&quot; 
           &quot;Wild, isn&#39;t it,&quot; he asks with a grin as the new 
information is quickly absorbed into Lina&#39;s memory. &quot;How &#39;bout some 
more?&quot; She nods rapidly. 
           &quot;Hell yes!&quot; She rests her head again, looking up wide-eyed 
at the screen. &quot;Hell yeah.&quot; 

--- 

           The progress bar moves forward, more magic spells being 
burned into Lina&#39;s catalog of powers. Flare Arrow, Freeze Arrow, Bomb 
Di Wind. Hawk squints at his control screens as Lina keeps absorbing 
everything he throws at her without even a break. Xelloss steps up 
behind Hawk, resting his hands on the operator&#39;s shoulders. &quot;How is 
she?&quot; 
           &quot;Ten hours straight, she&#39;s a machine,&quot; the black-haired man 
replies, shaking his head a little. It&#39;s rare anyone can outlast him 
at the core. 

--- 

           The final set of powers upload and when they finish, Lina 
relaxes as she opens her eyes. Glancing at Xelloss, she says with awe, 
&quot;I know magic.&quot; 
           Xel smiles as he leans closer, &quot;Show me.&quot; 

--- 

           This time, the Construct is much more than a white room. 
It&#39;s a small village, right out of medieval times. There are small 
one- and two-story houses in rows around a maze of dirt roads. A 
market area fills the center and the village spreads out around it. 
           On one rooftop stands Xelloss. His clothing is drastically 
different, dressed more like an ancient priest than a digital warrior. 
His black cape bellows in the wind behind his long-sleeve tan shirt, 
baggy black pants and light blue gloves. In his left hand he&#39;s holding 
a tall wooden staff, the top curled around a blood red gem. 
           On the other rooftop across from Xel&#39;s stands Lina. Her own 
clothing has gone through a drastic change. A black cape also flaps 
behind her, attached underneath two shoulder pads. She has on a 
mahogany tunic and pants, white boots and gloves, and a yellow band 
wrapped around her small chest. The pair looks like they&#39;d fit right 
in with the unusual setting. 
           &quot;What you&#39;re wearing now is a mage outfit, and this, this 
is a sparring program,&quot; Xelloss begins, voice carrying over to Lina. 
&quot;It&#39;s similar to the programmed reality of the Matrix--well, similar 
in that it has the same basic rules, rules like gravity. What you must 
learn is that these rules are no different than the rules of a 
computer system. Some of them can be bent. Others can be broken.&quot; His 
smile is visible even at the distance between them. &quot;Understand?&quot; She 
nods. &quot;Then hit me if you can,&quot; he calls in a playful singsong voice, 
dancing around on the rooftop. 
           With a grin, Lina unleashes a barrage of fireballs at the 
goofy priest. He twists and flips however, avoiding each one. Not 
letting that stop her, Lina follows up with several arrows of ice, 
firing them where she expects Xel will dodge. To her slight 
frustration, he&#39;s much faster than the spells it seems. 
           As if using second nature knowledge, Lina draws a sword 
from her belt and jumps across to Xel&#39;s roof, shouting as she swings. 
He blocks with his staff, eyes closed and grinning widely. With a 
quick twist, the sword and its holder are plunging off the short 
building and clatter and thud to the ground, respectively. 
           &quot;Good!&quot; Xel crouches down as he calls to the 
breathing-deeply girl, who climbs back to her feet. &quot;Adaptation, 
improvisation. But your weakness is not your technique,&quot; he explains 
as Lina nods. Suddenly, he&#39;s flipping back out of the way from the 
explosion that leaves a gaping hole in the house&#39;s upper wall and 
roof. 

           On the Dragon Slayer, Phibrizio dashes down to the ship&#39;s 
mess hall and throws open the door. &quot;Xelloss is fighting Lina,&quot; he 
shouts before running back, the rest of the crew jumping for the door 
after him when they hear that news. 

           In closer quarters now, the strikes and blocks move much 
faster than they should. Lina uses her sword, though it&#39;s always 
blocked by that staff (which, by the way, never shows notches from 
being hit by the sword&#39;s blade) and magic spells being avoided. 
           Deciding to try something else, Lina breaks off and goes 
dashing across the rooftop, Xel prowling after her like a jungle cat. 
Leaping across to the next roof, she sees a tall chimney and runs 
towards it. Xel watches, as Lina seems to run up the chimney, flipping 
over his head. He&#39;s ready though, and as soon as she lands, she&#39;s met 
with the hard point of a staff hitting against her chest and knocking 
her off the roof a second time. She hits the ground, cape spread out 
underneath her as she breathes heavily. 

           In the crowd around Hawk&#39;s control console, Zelgadis smirks 
when he glances at Seraya. 

           Xelloss looks down from the edge of the roof. &quot;How did I 
beat you?&quot; That constant smile remains on his face as Lina slowly 
climbs up to her knees, still panting deeply. 
           &quot;You&#39;re too fast,&quot; she wheezes out, looking up through her 
sweaty crimson bangs. 
           &quot;Do you believe that my being stronger or faster has 
anything to do with my muscles in this place,&quot; he asks, planting his 
staff against the roof. Lina remains frustrated, still not able to 
catch her breath. He bends down, resting his elbow on his knee. &quot;You 
think that&#39;s air you&#39;re breathing now?&quot; That statement causes Lina to 
pause, squinting up at the priest. His eyebrows raise, questioning 
look on his face. When she doesn&#39;t answer, he hm&#39;s as if no response 
answered his question and straightens. 
           He turns away from the edge of the roof, stepping forward 
once. &quot;Again.&quot; 

           All eyes on the Dragon Slayer stare at the images from the 
battle between their leader and their best hope. They watch as Lina 
and Xelloss face off again, this time in a battle of weapons, sword 
meeting staff as they both try to best each other. The already-blurry 
images become worse as the battle continues. 
           &quot;Jesus Christ, she&#39;s fast,&quot; Phibrizio says, staring at the 
screen and readings as he stands in front of the whole gang since he&#39;s 
the shortest. &quot;Take a look at these neurokinetics, they&#39;re way above 
normal,&quot; he tries to note as Hawk bats the boy&#39;s hand away, green eyes 
rolling. 

           The sound of the battle echoes through the empty town. 
Suddenly, she finds that staff right in front of her face. On 
instinct, she jumps back, crouching down defensively. Xel holds the 
staff there, having pulled his punch. &quot;What are you waiting for? 
You&#39;re faster than this. Don&#39;t think you are,&quot; he says, staff dropping 
a bit, &quot;know you are.&quot; Lunging forward again, Lina crosses her sword 
with Xel&#39;s staff, eyes fiery. &quot;Come on, stop trying to hit me and hit 
me,&quot; he taunts. 
           Anger nearly pours off the red-eyed girl, starting to break 
through Xel&#39;s defense as she hits harder and faster. To the gasps of 
everyone on the ship, Xelloss tenses slightly when the sword blade 
stops just short of his neck. 

           &quot;I don&#39;t believe it,&quot; Phibrizio whispers. 

           &quot;I know what you&#39;re trying to do,&quot; Lina says through 
gritted teeth, slowly lowering her sword. 
           &quot;I&#39;m trying to free your mind, Lina. But I can only show 
you the door. You&#39;re the one that has to walk through it,&quot; Xelloss 
says with a rather pleased smile. Despite nearly getting his head cut 
off, he is in quite the good mood. &quot;Hawk,&quot; he calls to the sky, &quot;load 
the jump program.&quot; 

           Their operator nods as he listens to his head set, swapping 
out discs and tapping at his keyboard before pressing the load button. 

           For a moment, the Construct is white once again before from 
far below, the top of a deep canyon rises up to Lina and Xel&#39;s feet. 
She glances around at the change in scenery before looking back. &quot;You 
have to let it all go, Lina. Fear, doubt, and disbelief.&quot; He starts to 
turn towards the cliff, a grin on his face. &quot;Free your mind.&quot; He takes 
off running towards the cliff&#39;s edge. To Lina&#39;s surprise and horror, 
he jumps off. 
           Only to fly up in the air, cape swirling up behind him 
before he lands on the other side of the canyon, looking back towards 
Lina. &quot;Whoa,&quot; she says quietly, then walks towards the cliff, seeing 
the very long drop that waits for her. &quot;Okey-dokey... free my mind,&quot; 
she mumbles to herself, looking back across at Xel waiting before 
starting to back up for running room. 

           &quot;What if she makes it,&quot; Phibrizio asks no one in 
particular. 
           &quot;No one&#39;s ever made their first jump,&quot; Hawk answers as he 
changes a certain setting for the program. 
           &quot;I know, I know, but... what if she does?&quot; 
           &quot;She won&#39;t,&quot; Garv grumbles from over the boy&#39;s shoulder. 
           &quot;C&#39;mon,&quot; Seraya whispers, fist clenched as she silently 
roots for the red-haired woman. 

           &quot;All right, no problem,&quot; Lina says to herself, rubbing her 
gloved hands together as she works up her courage. &quot;Free my mind, no 
problem, right,&quot; and she takes off in a mad dash. When she reaches the 
edge, she calls on all her strength and leaps, reaching towards 
Xelloss so far far away and now rising above her and uh oh. 
           Wide-eyed, she looks down then starts to scream, hair and 
cape being thrown around wildly in the wind as she falls. Closer and 
closer the rocky bottom of the canyon approaches and Lina closes her 
eyes tight. 
           What she doesn&#39;t see is the floor of the canyon sinks with 
her like a net, and then tosses her back up in a roll. It solidifies 
at a button press from not far away and she lands much gentler on her 
back. 

           Sighs sound around the Dragon Slayer then the crowd starts 
to break up, Garv mumbling as he walks off. &quot;But what does that mean,&quot; 
Phibrizio asks no one a second time, trying to see meaning. 
           &quot;It doesn&#39;t mean anything,&quot; Eris answers before walking off 
herself. 
           &quot;Everybody falls their first time,&quot; Zelgadis comments, 
&quot;right Ser?&quot; When he glances in her direction, though, the blond girl 
is already gone. 

           Staring up at the cloudless sky, Lina laughs faintly, mind 
still racing to catch up with what happened. She doesn&#39;t notice 
Xelloss floating down effortlessly and landing lightly beside her. 
&quot;Everyone falls the first time,&quot; he says as he offers his hand, 
helping Lina back to her feet as she nods slowly. &quot;If you never know 
failure, how can you know success?&quot; 

           Back on the ship, both combatants open their eyes. Hawk 
helps Lina with the restraints and pulls the long plug out of her 
neck, her eyes shutting tightly at the still-strange sensation of 
something being removed from deep in her head. She hardly notices her 
sweaty skin and shirt before starting to sit up, and then groans 
weakly, cradling her ribs as she touches the inside of her mouth with 
her other hand. Her finger tips reappear smeared with blood. Xelloss 
looks over at her after Gourry pulls out his plug, forehead dry and 
looking rather calm despite the intensive training. 
           &quot;I thought it wasn&#39;t real,&quot; she asks, still staring at her 
hand. 
           &quot;Your mind makes it real,&quot; he answers. Lina thinks about 
that. 
           &quot;If you&#39;re killed in the Matrix,&quot; she starts, looking up at 
Xel, &quot;you die here?&quot; 
           &quot;The body cannot live without the mind.&quot;
