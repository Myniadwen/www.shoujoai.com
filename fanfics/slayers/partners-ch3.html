<a href="../slayers/partners-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>	As she had expected, Naga did not wake that night, and thus,
she had only managed a total of fifteen minutes rest.  Still, with
the scent of spices in the air, and the glow of freshly baked bread
all about, Lina couldn&#39;t help but feel invigorated and alive during
this, the 33rd Annual Food Fest of Mellon Town.
	&quot;Ooh!  Look!&quot; she exclaimed, pointing to a stand displaying
pies overflowing with ripe apples, dusted off with cinnamon and
sugar.	&quot;And there!&quot; she squealed, turning her attention to a spiced
flock of chickens, slowly roasting over scented wood chips.
&quot;Which one should I eat first?	Oh this is such a dilemma! 
Chicken...pie...ooohhh, they have my favorite!	Grog sausages!&quot;
	Naga smirked as she watched her companion flitter about the
tens upon tens of food stalls and stands, loading up with a plateful
of kabobs that would have fed a battalion of troops for weeks.	&quot;Oh
Lina, you&#39;re such a child...no wonder -I- always excell above you at
the Academy,&quot; she began.
	&quot;I don&#39;t know how you ever graduated with the social graces of
a--&quot;  Naga sniffed the air. &quot;Ooh!  Honey batter dipped coconut
prawns!&quot;  The black-clad sorceress disappeared into the crowd.
	Lina chuckled to herself as she watched Naga Freeze Arrow an
unfortunate youth who challenged her for the last plate of the
morning.  Triumphantly, Naga strutted back towards Lina, curves
swaying in the wind, breasts dangerously close to popping out from
their leather prison.	Lina found herself half mesmerized by their
movement, and quickly chided herself for it.  
	&quot;Now who were you calling a &#39;child&#39; there, huh?&quot; Lina
grinned, tossing a nervous wink in Naga&#39;s direction.
	&quot;Hmmpm.  You&#39;re just jealous that -I-, Naga the Serpent,
snatched the last of these tasty morsels from your clutches, little
girl.&quot;
	It was Lina&#39;s turn to smirk now.  &quot;Sure sure, of course,
Naga, whatever you say.&quot;  She glanced around.  &quot;Now, what do you say
we have some dessert?&quot;
	Naga polished off the last of the coconut flaked shrimp, tail
and all, and nodded enthusiastically.  
	&quot;Let&#39;s see...look over there!&quot;	Lina&#39;s heart almost stopped
as she gazed upon a bright pink sign.  She read the words upon such
out loud, savoring each syllable as if she were reading a page from
the Claire Bible itself.  &quot;Frozen...custard...&quot; she began,
&quot;Double Chocolate Chip Caramel Swirl Hot Fudge Delight!!&quot;
	Naga had already begun towards the booth by the time Lina had
finished reading.  Lina raced after her, yelling to the old man in
charge of the booth to prepare six sugar waffle cones just for her. 
Handing the man six silvers, she accepted the cones an
proceeded to munch down on them.  Naga sniffed haughtily.
	&quot;You never had any manners,&quot; the taller of the two remarked,
finishing up her fourth cone.
	Lina barked out something that would have been a curse had
her mouth not been completely full.
	&quot;Lina!	Don&#39;t talk with your mouth full!  You sprayed that
stuff all over me!&quot; Naga cried as she wiped the tear shaped drops off
her leather brassiere.
	&quot;Oh don&#39;t be such a baby,&quot; Lina scowled.  &quot;See?  Voila.  It
comes off just like that,&quot; she said, reaching out to brush away the
stains.
	As her gloved fingers touched the soft of Naga&#39;s breast, the
tiny crest of the nipple, a dull shot of electricity climbed up
Lina&#39;s arm.  She found herself trembling ever so slightly, and she
pulled back suddenly, meeting Naga&#39;s dark eyes in horror.
	Naga raised an eyebrow.  &quot;What on earth is going on, Lina?&quot;
	Lina shook her head.
	&quot;You made the stain worse!  Do you know how hard it is to
clean leather?&quot;
	Lina nodded, but not one word out of Naga&#39;s mouth registered.
	She felt a stirring within, a deep yearning for something,
but for what?  She could not begin to guess.  A crimson color filled
her cheeks as she felt an odd dampness between her legs.  Something
she had never experienced before.  But something she wanted to feel
again, soon, and very much.
