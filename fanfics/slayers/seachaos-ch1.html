<pre>Partings and Arrivals - An Unexpected Twist

(Buffy)
I wished I had had more time. Somehow I wished I had had more time. I 
had felt it coming from the day onward that Dracula showed me parts 
of my own nature - though I still didn&#39;t believe they were rooted in 
darkness - I had seen it coming. When the true nature of Glory was 
revealed to me by Travers and we went out to get Dawn back... I had 
known for sure that I would not survive this battle.
	As the white light of the dimensional vortex engulfed me, I 
thought that it might be better that way. I was tired, tired to 
endure this again and again. There was much a Slayer could master, 
much one could overcome and I never considered myself a quitter 
because I always wanted to see Willow and my friends safe - and I was 
the best and only way to ensure that. However, there is only a 
certain amount of pressure and despair even I can take. Over the 
course of the year my life had gone to pieces in an unyielding 
downward spiral. Taking responsibility for a sister that never really 
existed, dealing with Willow&#39;s relationship with Tara, dealing with 
Riley and his departure, dealing with Mom&#39;s death... almost losing 
Dawn. That had been the final straw and if the incredible redhead 
hadn&#39;t intervened I would probably never even have mastered the 
courage and sanity to save my sister and do my duty - one last time.
	They were alright now. A new slayer would be called or Faith 
released - and I had at least a bit hope for her, Willow was becoming 
more powerful and could keep the others save for awhile, Spike would 
be there too, bound to his promise. Dawn could try and live a normal 
life. And Willow, Willow had her Tara back, who was I to compete with 
that? She had gone to such great lengths and risks to restore her 
mind, I could not even begin to think of a way to fit into this. 
Willow was happy, that was all that counted. My mission here was 
over, my time had come, I could finally rest... Huh?
	I caught sight of something passing by in the opposite 
direction and for a moment managed to identify a petite redhead, 
younger than me in a fancy garb. She was screaming audible. I 
wondered what exactly was going on but the girl had already vanished 
from my sight and we continued onward in the direction the other one 
had come from. Suddenly the exact meaning of where I was at the 
moment came to mind and I had the sudden urge to shake my head in 
dismay. &quot;They don&#39;t even let you die when you want...&quot; I sighed and 
closed my eyes, bracing for impact, as a brighter swirling vortex 
appeared before me, similar to the one I had just jumped through.
	There was a flash that blinded me even through closed eyes 
and then I felt the familiar sensations of elemental forces upon my 
skin. Mainly wind but I was sure the earth was not very far by. 
Reacting on instinct I forced my body into a roll and with a wince 
and the not very reassuring noise of protesting bones, I somehow 
managed to land on my own two feet. Only to wobble slightly as I 
pried my eyes open to take in my surroundings and landing on my 
butt. &quot;Ouch.&quot; Graceful, Summers, very impressive!
	I groaned and rubbed my eyes. What I saw didn&#39;t betray my 
first conclusion I had made instinctively while entering this 
other... dimension, I assumed. The air was thick and smelled like a 
lot of energy had been used here recently. Powerful energy, probably 
magic and more. The sky was just beginning to clear from heavy, dark 
clouds and all around me there was... nothing. Well, almost nothing 
except for the several miles wide crater which made the impression, 
as if dozens of nuclear explosion had tried to flatten the area. But 
there was no feeling of radioactivity in the air and everything 
seemed to be fine now. Nothing dangerous, no sense of impending doom.
	I stood up groggily and for the first time noticed several 
figures close by scattered around the ground. Two males, one with 
strange blue-gray skin and two females. Walking over to them, I 
observed that no one seemed to be badly hurt or conscious for that 
matter, except for the two girls. One was gripping the other&#39;s hand 
tightly and a dim golden lightly slowly faded away, her blonde hair 
pale and eyes closed in exhaustion. The dark-haired girl next to her 
seemed to be awake although in a state of shock, as much as I could 
tell.
	I approached them slowly, making sure not to appear dangerous 
as I knelt down to slowly pry the blondes hand away from the 
shivering girl. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; I asked cautiously, wondering 
again how the heck I always got myself into such situations. The girl 
seemed to not hear me at first, before she blinked and tried to focus 
on me. &quot;Li..Lina, is that you...?&quot; Her voice was weak but laced with 
such a powerful desperation I flinched. She was obviously still in 
shock. Something told me she wasn&#39;t talking about her friend next to 
her. When I remembered the other girl in the gateway...
	&quot;I&#39;m afraid not,&quot; I said, squeezing her hand that had grabbed 
mine, as if it was a lifeline. Her strength faltered and I was sure, 
if I didn&#39;t talk quickly, I might lose her. &quot;She wouldn&#39;t happen to 
have light red hair, some fancy robe in black and...&quot;
	&quot;You saw her? Who are you? Where is she? Is she okay?&quot; I 
almost fell back at the fury of the question the suddenly quite 
active girl launched at me and I stared up at the seemingly helpless 
girl standing threateningly over me, demanding immediate answers. How 
did she do that? Ah, well, better answer quickly. I gathered my 
thoughts that were still a bit foggy from the near-death 
experience. &quot;I cannot guarantee you anything but if the fact that I&#39;m 
here, there this Lina is, if she is who I think you are talking 
about, when she probably is now in the dimension I just came from...&quot; 
Ack, I was babbling like Willow now but the sight of the frantic girl 
in front of me reminded me to much of my best friend at the moment. 
The girl swayed slightly and then collapsed back against the stone 
she had previously been leaning on. &quot;Oh...&quot; After a long pause there 
none of us moved, she elaborated that last remark a bit more 
clearly. &quot;Do you think she&#39;s alright?&quot; I briefly considered telling 
her that I had entered the vortex parallel to a several feet high 
tower and that it would be most likely that the fall would not be a 
light one but decided against it, when I saw the hopeful expression 
in the girl&#39;s face. &quot;I&#39;m here, aren&#39;t I?&quot;

(Amelia)
Lina... gone? Gone... Lina? That was the only coherent thought for a 
long time steadily repeating itself in my mind until the blonde girl 
who appeared out of nowhere had gotten my attention. Why did it hurt 
so much? Okay, Lina was a friend, a good friend that is, and she was 
very special to me, to any of us. It was normal to feel sad. But why 
did it hurt so much inside, why had I acted like a complete idiot in 
front of the strange girl who obviously had no idea where she was or 
what happened either? Was it because I felt guilty? That might be. 
After all Lina had only be pressed to cast the Giga Slave when our 
cycle was broken. I should have had the presence of mind to at least 
once fulfill a responsible task but no, I had to stupidly stand there 
and let the blast smash me almost into oblivion, if not for Filia&#39;s 
help. Something had gone horribly wrong and I felt responsible for 
it, for Lina&#39;s... whatever happened to her. Yeah, I guess that is it. 
So, why is there still this nagging sense that I am missing something 
here?
	I shrugged the thought off for the moment and surveyed the 
area around us... Which had nothing to observe other than the 
unconscious state of my friends and the missing presence of Xellos 
although you could never be sure about him. Filia was leaning on the 
same stone next to me and looked almost deathly pale from the strain 
the recovery spell had put her through. Poor girl, she spent probably 
all of her energy. Although I felt the urge to return the favor at 
least a bit - especially since I was fully restored and healthy -, I 
knew that these dragons could recover in the blink of an eye.
	Slowly I looked back at the blonde girl who returned the gaze 
with equal caution and I was a bit taken aback by her solemn 
expression, sagged shoulders, averted eyes... Overall she made the 
impression, as if she just escaped a close encounter with death - 
which was not at all unfamiliar to me at the moment - but actually 
was sad and frustrated that she was still alive. I had always been a 
bit empathic, I guess, and this hopeless look she gave to the world 
in general sent a shiver down my spine. It reminded too much of 
Valgaarv at the moment.
	&quot;So,&quot; I said after a time, ignoring her previous attempt at 
lightening my mood, &quot;what&#39;s your name?&quot;
	&quot;Buffy. Buffy Summers. Yours?&quot; the blonde replied. &quot;Amelia 
Wil Tesla Saillune.&quot; Buffy arched an eyebrow. &quot;Royalty?&quot; I nodded 
slightly. &quot;Princess.&quot; Buffy nodded and after that silence reigned for 
another few moments before I tried to break it again, not wanting to 
fell into the process of thinking about Lina again. &quot;And you?&quot; The 
blonde looked at me quizzically before I further clarified. &quot;What do 
you do... besides falling out of giant portals that pop into the 
middle of our personal Armageddon.&quot; Now I was being sarcastic but 
that was better than dealing with thoughts about Lina... &quot;Oh...&quot; 
Buffy said, was quiet for a moment, then said: &quot;Just a girl who more 
or less deliberately tries to fight the forces of evil, namely 
vampires, demons etc...&quot;
	My eyes gleamed at that. There was something I could identify 
myself with that. A fellow hero serving justice. &quot;That&#39;s great!&quot; I 
exclaimed but became worried when Buffy just stared at me, as if I 
was totally missing the point... Was I missing the point? She shook 
her head after awhile. &quot;Try it and tell me two years later, if you 
still think it&#39;s great.&quot; The sarcasm dripping from her voice made me 
shudder and remind me of that life- and hopeless look I had witnessed 
before. Immediately I mentally slapped myself for my childish 
behavior and need to change the subject. This fellow heroine had 
obviously some hard times behind her and sometimes during Valgaarv&#39;s 
speech about the pointlessness of our existence, I had felt like 
agreeing with him on some level.
	Glancing around I judged by experience that the others would 
be out of it for at least half an hour from the exhaustion and the 
backlash of the Giga Slave that had almost scattered us in all 
directions, again. There was no use waking them up and getting them 
somewhere more comfortable and suited for resting. None of us would 
be able to cast a single spell - whether levitation or a Raywing - 
and Filia would not be able to carry us all after focusing all her 
power on snatching me from the threshold of death. Coming to the 
realization that there would be nothing that I could do for now, I 
relaxed against the stone and sent a softer look in Buffy&#39;s 
direction. &quot;Want to talk about it?&quot; She shrugged nonchalantly. &quot;Why 
not...&quot;
	For the next fifteen to thirty minutes we exchanged basically 
our life stories up to this point. Ok, not that detailed but I 
managed to slowly draw the other girl out of her shell and learning 
in the process about her calling as the Slayer and a general idea of 
the trials she had to go through. I think she avoided some key points 
but that was alright with me. After listening for a while and 
especially about the last year and her fight with a Goddess, I really 
wasn&#39;t all that sure, if I wanted to trade. No, I was certain I 
didn&#39;t want to.
	I, in turn, explained what we were doing and what our latest 
adventure was all about. Summing all facts up we came to a basic 
conclusion that Buffy seemed to have already made with the knowledge 
of The Key&#39;s function. Somehow the Giga Slave and the brief opening 
in dimensions had interfered with each other and caused the reaction 
of not just simply killing both Lina and Buffy at their individual 
tasks of saving all of creation but instead sweeping them in the 
dimension of the other.
	By that time the others slowly began regaining consciousness.

(Lina)
A low moan escaped my lips as the world around me slowly rearranged 
itself. My body felt drained beyond anything I&#39;ve ever felt before, 
my magical reserves were just beginning to refill and I had no idea 
how long I had been out of it. Out of it. Well, there is a thought to 
consider. The question still dwelled on me, if I was still alive or 
dead as I had assumed. My vision was still a bit blurry but I could 
make out that I was in a bed, in an unfamiliar room that definitely 
wasn&#39;t an inn or anything similar, that I could tell from experience. 
I groaned. &quot;If that is another play to make fun of me, I&#39;m going to 
kill the others.&quot;
	I sat up and nodded that my usual clothing was not there, 
instead I wore a simple pajama - gah, girl&#39;s clothes. Discarding the 
subject for the moment, I tested, if I could stand up and found out 
to my mutual surprise that though I was still magically weak, my body 
seemed to be well-rested. &quot;Guess I slept awhile.&quot; Looking out of the 
window, I noted wherever I was, it was probably late afternoon and 
the sun was already rather low. The whole atmosphere of this place 
was a bit off too and I could not quite determine what exactly felt 
so different.
	I decided that mulling over the subject right now was not 
likely to gain me any further wisdom about this place. So I walked 
over to the door and out into a dimly-lit hallway. Voices could be 
heard from downstairs and I followed them, curiously descending the 
stairs. I reached a larger room and paused at the door to scan over 
the assembled group. They all seemed ordinary human but even with my 
reduced magical senses, the remaining were clearly picking different 
signs and potential levels from all them.
	There was the dark-haired, younger girl who ignited a feeling 
in me, reminding me of my brief experience of falling down a long 
white tunnel... Had that really happened? Then there was the stoic, 
older man with glasses who gleamed not only with authority but also 
with a hidden familiarity with black magic. One of the obvious 
couples didn&#39;t seem that extraordinary - though still potential - but 
the girl had a similar aura as Xellos. The two girls, sitting in the 
large couch, cuddled together, struck me the most. The blonde had 
such a pureness around her, it reminded of Sylphiel. She was strong 
and obviously a mage at least on the same level as Amelia currently 
was. The petite redhead however nearly sent me tumbling and my senses 
screaming. I consider myself highly powerful but this girl had such a 
raw power under her skin it certainly matched, if not even surpassed 
mine. But she had just began to tap into her potential and there was 
the brief taint that black magic usually caused, if used blind and 
without caution. She needed training, I immediately decided, although 
I had no idea why I should care.
	As my gaze lingered on her, the redhead slowly turned her 
head in my direction, probably sensing my presence. &quot;Oh, you&#39;re 
awake. Why don&#39;t you sit down and we talk.&quot; The others looked up and 
around also. Whoever these people were, for some strange reason I 
felt, as if I could trust them. At least I could trust the redhead 
although if you asked me, I could not tell you why.
	Introductions were made after that and I came to quickly 
confirm their theory of a dimensional exchange of that Buffy-person 
and me. Though I uttered the idea that the exchange might have only 
been &quot;world&quot;-wise and that I merely landed in another of the three 
worlds... most likely not Ames&#39;. That, however, needed as I expected 
some explanation and made me wonder, if their dimensional theory 
wasn&#39;t the better one, considering how less they knew over the Sea of 
Chaos and the very fabric of creation.
	&quot;Ok, time out here. You&#39;re trying to tell us that all of 
creation rest upon a sea? And we are just one part of it?&quot; 
interrupted Xander my explanations. I gave an annoyed sigh and 
repeated once again. &quot;Yes, Xander, the worlds resides upon The Sea of 
Chaos or more clearly they are PART of the Sea of Chaos. There are 
four worlds, all of them with the basic principle of one God and one 
Demon Lord fighting for domination. In my world these were Ceiphied 
and Ruby Eye Shabranigdu who were both split into parts through 
ancient battles. I think it is possible that your world might also be 
one of the other two worlds we haven&#39;t learned about but it doesn&#39;t 
have to be that way.&quot;
	&quot;Well, what you say sounds like the basic struggle between 
Good and Evil, but I don&#39;t see the Slayer, Vampires and anything fit 
into this. And I certainly didn&#39;t encounter a dragon yet,&quot; reasoned 
Tara calmly. To this Anya suddenly spoke up. &quot;Oh, I saw some, but 
that was a few centuries ago.&quot; His boyfriend gave her an raised 
eyebrow but shrugged then. I eyed her curiously. She might have been 
a demon, once, but didn&#39;t seem to be very frightening.
	Willow suddenly looked out of the window and nervously 
glanced outside. &quot;Will?&quot; asked Tara softly with a hand on her 
girlfriend&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t someone patrol?&quot; Giles nodded to 
that. &quot;Yes, quite. You&#39;re still to exhausted though. I think, Xander, 
Anya and I should go. We go fetch Spike and make a quick sweep.&quot; That 
got my curiosity doubled. &quot;Hey, that&#39;s something I would like to 
see.&quot; Everyone stared at me disbelievingly. &quot;I already told you I am 
the best sorceress there is! Vampires would surely be something 
different from the usual Mazoku.&quot;

(Filia)
I was feeling empty. And that was not due to the drain in magic, that 
wasn&#39;t really the problem. Dragon Magic was powerful and drained a 
lot but dragon resources were even bigger and we could recover very, 
very fast. No, that was not the problem, not the emptiness I felt. 
Hollow might describe but would still be too light. The scenes kept 
repeating themselves in my mind, unbidden, merciless. It had all 
happened so fast, the moment of prophecy had arrived, my OWN 
prophecy. And I had screwed it up, not only endangering the lives of 
everyone in creation but also forcing Lina to take the ultimate 
prize. It didn&#39;t really matter that she might simply be in another 
dimension due to corresponding events. I sent her there! I screwed 
up! I chickened out! And because of me she had been ready to give her 
life, Xellos had lost his... And poor Amelia properly the last bit of 
her innocence, not to mention a bit of her sanity.
	Therefore I could not really blame her for avoiding me in 
favor to acquaint with the sweeper. I had heard of inter-dimensional 
exchanges before so I was the least bit surprised when I woke up and 
heard the girl&#39;s story, her theory was quickly confirmed. At least 
that cheered up Amelia somewhat, the fact that I had no idea how to 
reserve it was not so pleasant. And there weren&#39;t any gold dragons 
left I could ask. I was the last and I had failed them.
	At the beginning of this journey I had been innocent and 
na&iuml;ve, a mere child - by dragon age - setting out on her first
great 
journey in the great, wide world. An important journey no less. Maybe 
a to difficult journey for an inexperienced priestess as I had been. 
Then I met the one I was looking for, Lina Inverse, and learned many 
things. I grew up, so to say but inside I still was a little girl. 
Compared to the rest of the group I was the least matured, I had 
never much actively participated in battle, hesitant to use my 
magical skills. I had overcome this, so I thought. But in the one 
moment where it really mattered, I was too scared and shocked to act. 
No matter how saddened I had been by Valgaarv&#39;s tale, I had a 
responsible to those who carried out MY mission. And I had failed 
them.
	The greatly reduced party slowly made their way through the 
wasteland created by Dark Star/Valgaarv and the effects of the Giga 
Slave. Gourry and Zelgadis were walking ahead. Both still carried 
their light weapons. Sirius had left shortly after we woke up, 
thanking and apologizing to us. After all Dark Star WAS gone. He 
promised that he&#39;d look for a way to use the portal other than a 
bridge between our and his world in order to search for Lina. To 
prove this he left the weapons of the Dark Star behind with us, 
Gourry had been certainly glad about that although I thought he would 
have given up the sword if asked.
	After them came Amelia and the new girl, Buffy, talking 
silently. They seemed to get along well, which was a good thing. Both 
surely needed someone understanding to their situation. Every time I 
tried to look into Amelia&#39;s eyes I flinched, the pain there still 
evident and I was certain it would only go away when Lina returned. 
The other girl though... Buffy&#39;s aura was spectacular to say the 
least and if there was any doubt, the strong corona of light proved 
her to be a strong chosen warrior.
	I walked behind them, uncomfortable to still be here. By all 
means they should send me away and I could not even have blamed them, 
only me. What I had done was unforgivable and I was ashamed. However, 
I still had a duty to perform. The least I could do was see to it 
that they safely returned home, to the land so long hidden away by 
the magical barrier. I had dragged them here, so I would get them 
back. I owned Lina that much. Even with my recovery ability it would 
be some time though before I could fly again.
	&quot;Filia?&quot; My head jerked around and I noticed with 
astonishment that Amelia had fallen back and was now walking beside 
me. I had been so focused on my own self-misery that I hadn&#39;t even 
noticed her falling in step with me. I could not bear to look at her 
long, so my head went back down, not daring to look anywhere but the 
ground in front of me. A hand touched my shoulder gently and a 
shudder run down my spine. &quot;Filia, look at me.&quot; Slowly I raised my 
head and almost instantly choked out an incoherently apology. The 
softness and forgiveness in her eyes, the... pity... was worse than 
any anger or hatred. I could deal with the latter. But that, THAT 
look I didn&#39;t deserve. I didn&#39;t deserve forgiveness. Not from her, 
especially not from her. I had almost gotten her killed, I had taken 
Lina from her. A child at heart, I might be, but I had noticed the 
shy glances, the almost undetectable urge for closeness. I think Lina 
never noticed but I had, maybe it was my innocence or something. 
Amelia had strong feelings for the sorceress, she probably wasn&#39;t 
even aware of, that is why she shouldn&#39;t give me that look. Not me. 
Not the person who had been responsible for the sweep ultimately.
	Without a word I felt small arms wrap around my waist and 
drawing me closer against my will. I should run now, I should shimmer 
into my kin form and fly far, far away. The problem was I didn&#39;t have 
the strength. Neither physically, nor mentally. Running away would be 
like hesitating in this crucial moment and I never EVER wanted to do 
this again. I whimpered a bit as Amelia strengthened her embrace and 
slowly, with trembling hands returned the gesture. Tears were 
unbidden running down my face. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; I choked 
out finally and Amelia just held on tighter. The group had stopped 
and watched on silently but I didn&#39;t really care anymore. All that 
was left were Amelia and I, a human and a dragon, a princess and a 
dragon, crying for the loss they had experienced.

(Giles)
&quot;DYNAST BRASS!&quot;
	I must say, I have never been impressed like that in my whole 
life - with the exception of Buffy probably. The vampires howled in 
pain, as they were engulfed in a glowing pentagram and literally 
impaled by lightning. The skill and ease with which the girl handled 
such powerful magic that had nothing to do with anything I ever did 
in my youth was impressive and at the same time overly frightening. 
We had been on patrol for all but fifteen minutes now and Lina 
Inverse had single-handily - much to Spike&#39;s annoyance - ripped 
through every undead creature we had come across. Especially her fire 
magic proved to be awfully useful in reducing the forces of evil 
tonight. That was the fourth graveyard by now and the numbers had 
greatly decreased, apparently word had gotten around about the 
new &quot;slayer&quot;.
	&quot;So, how was that?&quot; Lina asked turning away from the ashes 
left behind from her latest spell, She grinned and glanced in my 
direction but I noticed her gaze was mostly directed at Tara and 
Willow, who she had insisted should come along. Both of them had 
simply stood back and watched in awe at Lina&#39;s quick work. If anyone 
ever asked for a worthy substitution for the Slayer, here she 
stood... &quot;Well, yes...&quot; I cleared my throat, trying to get my nerves 
back together. &quot;That was quite... impressive,&quot; I replied eyeing the 
girl critically.
	&quot;Impressive? Giles, come on, that was the quickest disposal 
of surely over a dozens vamps - not to include the two demons - that 
I have ever seen!&quot; commented Xander, Anya quietly nodded, Willow and 
Tara just continued staring. I sighed deeply. As much as their 
enthusiasm was justified, everything concerning black magic gave me - 
as the teens would say - the wiggins. That was partly rooted in my 
Ripper days as much as personal experience over my days as a 
Watcher. &quot;Indeed, Xander, very impressive. But I suggest we...&quot;
	I was interrupted from a low growl and we all whirled around 
to face a massive-built demon that radiated more power than 
everything we had encountered tonight together. A typical chaos 
demon. What is with this town? I thought bitterly to myself as I 
readied myself for battle. It almost seems, as if word that Buffy&#39;s 
not here anymore spread like a wildfire. Gripping my battle axe 
tighter, I advised calmly to the rest: &quot;Be careful. Don&#39;t take it 
lightly...&quot;
	As always tonight my advice was taken by everyone but Lina. 
The mage rushed forward and immediately unleashed a fury of flare 
arrows at the demon. This time, however, she was taken by surprise as 
the demon rushed right through her assault and rammed its head into 
her chest. Spike, Xander and I moved forward to intercept the 
creature but were stopped as it simply stood there and laughed. &quot;That 
is your pitiful attempt of a Slayer replacement, mortals? Then I 
heard the news from our master that the Slayer is gone but a new 
force replaced her, I must say I was interested. But what do I find? 
An unattractive witch with a few fancy spells that cannot even handle 
herself in real combat? That&#39;s a waste of my time!&quot;
	Xander groaned at the arrogance of the demon. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t 
go around making judgments over little girls with a flat chest...&quot; A 
low hiss interrupted him and we all turned around to see Lina already 
back on her feet and if I didn&#39;t know any better I would say there 
was actually fire surrounding her. Her eyes were merely slits and the 
expression... I will not go there. &quot;Who? Are? You? Calling? 
Unattractive? A waste of your time, huh? Well, I show you who really 
is the waste of time here!&quot; Lina stood there, as if to consider for a 
moment, then closed her eyes and the three talismans I noticed before 
started to glow. &quot;Lord of the Darkness and the Four Worlds, I call 
upon you, grant me all the power that you possess! Lord of the 
Darkness and Four Worlds, I beseech thy fragments; by all of the 
power thou possesseth, grant the heavens&#39; wrath to my hand; unleash 
the sword of dark, freezing nothingness; by our power, our combined 
might, let us walk as one along the path of destruction: LAGUNA 
BLADE!&quot;
	I gasped as the crackling sword of pure blackness manifested 
in Lina&#39;s hand and I saw Tara and Willow taking two steps back 
immediately. The amount of power was unbelievable. That was not just 
simple black magic, THAT was pure chaos! Power directly from the 
source of all existence, from the nothingness that was before 
creation. To use Lina&#39;s own explanations, she was drawing the sword 
from the Sea of Chaos. That was almost an unbelievable thought. I had 
come across many wielders of magic in my life, I have read about even 
more. But this girl, not more than eighteen, would put every so-
called master mage to shame.
	The demon did not have time to react, as Lina rushed forward 
again, swinging the Laguna Blade with experience and ease. A loud 
scream echoed over the graveyard, and I was sure every creature of 
the night heard it, as the Chaos Demon was simply ripped apart and 
out of existence. Something even a Slayer would have trouble doing.
	Breathing hard Lina let the blade fade away and turned a 
tired but confident look in Xander&#39;s direction. &quot;Now what did you 
want to say about my figure?&quot; Xander swallowed hard and Anya didn&#39;t 
look any better. &quot;No..nothing,&quot; was all he managed to stutter out and 
I couldn&#39;t blame him. At the moment I truly didn&#39;t trust my own legs.

(Buffy)
With a groan I plodded down on the ground onto the spare sleeping 
bag. I think it has been Lina&#39;s. The last two days had gone by 
quickly and merely consisted of walking and talking, mostly with 
Amelia. The young witch... sorceress - they apparently did not like 
the term - had filled me in a bit more about the history of her 
world. How magic worked in this world and such things. Our worlds 
were so different I could hardly believe we even could communicate - 
come to think of it, how is it possible that they are speaking 
English? Or did I just think they did that and it was a spell too? 
The main differences were obvious. Where our world was more 
technological advanced, this one was gifted with a high level of 
magic. The part of the world we were traveling through had been 
unaware of the potential but it was still there. I could feel it in 
the air all around me. I didn&#39;t need to have magical skills to 
determine that.
	Besides the great differences where were the minor ones. The 
population was more sparse and wide-spread than in our world, wide 
areas of nature still graced the land, the air was much cleaner. It 
seemed liked a setting out of the middle age in Europe. Without 
actually seeing any civilization yet I had the feeling that this 
world was better of without technology. I mean who needed it than 
magic was such a daily life thing?
	As I said the walk had been rather uneventful... until a 
dozen or so creatures jumped us that weren&#39;t actually keen to see us, 
so to speak. The whole fight was probably one of the most 
embarrassing moments in my life. Amelia had told me that there was a 
thin line between monsters and beasts in this world and though she 
also mentioned that often it was easy to tell the difference, I still 
had no idea what actually jumped us. Only that they were, fast, 
strong and I had totally screwed up. Only a few of my hits even 
managed to connect. Before I had known it I was bruised, beaten and 
humiliated. The rest of our group had rather easily disposed of the 
things with a few spells. Gah...
	Maybe I was just tired, maybe the crossing of dimension had 
drained me or put a block on my Slayer abilities? Maybe I had just 
been too excited to impress the only people I knew in this world... 
Maybe I simply didn&#39;t want to be a nuisance. I wasn&#39;t used to in the 
way.
	Willow would feel at home here, she&#39;d be right in her 
element, I thought fondly as my thoughts turned back to the friends I 
left behind on my world and wished I was with them or they were here, 
that Willow was with me. I felt alone. Amelia and the others were 
nice but this world still was so utterly strange and unfamiliar. I 
had dealt the last couple of years with mysteries, legends, myths and 
the sort, so I think I coped better with all that when a normal human 
would have but I still missed everyone. My sacrifice had been to 
finally receive the rest I deserved, with the knowledge that my 
friends were safe. And yet, I was still alive, in a world I did not 
know and far away from those I loved. The fact that I screwed up big 
time today had certainly not helped.
	The organization of this world seemed strangely familiar. 
Gods - Dragons - and Demons - Mazoku - fighting for supremacy and 
humans in between. The wild cards so to say. Sounded a lot like home 
just more simple and basically known by the majority of people. Yes. 
Willow would surely be thrilled by all this. Maybe she was learning 
with this Lina person right now. From the way Amelia spoke about her 
she seemed to be the best human sorceress around here, she would 
certainly do my best friend some good. I still remembered visibly the 
look in her eyes when she had faced of with Glory in a blind rush of 
rage. Nightmares had plagued me days after that event despite 
everything I had on my mind around that time. It had scared me and I 
never wanted to see her so out of control again.
	I really hoped she would be taught. Seeing the others so 
causally throw their spells around, I could just imagine what the 
local demon population would say, if Willow could do that. My job 
certainly would be a lot easier and Willow much more able to defend 
herself. But what if the sweep hadn&#39;t been entirely successful, what 
if Amelia&#39;s friend had really died falling from the several foot high 
tower, what... Oh, stuff it, Summers! Things like that don&#39;t happen 
with a purpose. You were supposed to be dead by now and this exchange 
would make no sense, if the other party simply died ridiculously 
while you are still alive! Giles would have said the same thing. He 
had taught me that there always was a balance, without a balance 
everything would fall apart, order would stagnate and chaos would 
literally explode on us. No, I was sure Lina was alive and somehow 
that made me feel better. The hellmouth would not be without a 
capable &quot;slayer&quot;. And Willow would not need to do something rush.
	That was one of my greatest fears. In the last years, ever 
since meeting Tara, her magic had increased dramatically as had her 
confidence. There was still the shy little Willow under all the new 
layers but... If I had really been dead, I was sure she&#39;d think I had 
been pulled into some sort of hell dimension and attempted to bring 
me back while in reality I had been in Heaven or something. I 
chuckled at the thought. Yes, that would surely be my Willow. And 
Giles would probably get a major case of &quot;cleaning his glasses&quot;. 
Power was always linked with temptation and I feared my best friend 
would not be able to withstand this temptation without the right 
guidance. Hopefully Lina could give her that.
	Gazing up at the stars, I felt sleep slowly claiming me and 
sent a last prayer to the patron Goddess of this world, Flare Dragon 
Ceiphied. Please be safe, Willow. I miss you...

(Tara)
Another day had gone by fairly quick and everyone tried their best to 
cope. College was hard, especially for Willow, more and more I saw 
her slip in a trance, staring at nothing. That was the &quot;Buffy 
Depression Phase&quot;, other times, when we talked about our newest, 
temporary Scooby, she got all excited and that. No, really. She 
practically burst from anticipation for this night&#39;s patrol. And to 
be serious, exactly that behavior worried me. That is why I was 
coming downstairs now, looking for our new houseguest who we had 
given Buffy&#39;s room since we already rearranged Joyce bedroom for 
Willow and me. To let her sleep on the couch just didn&#39;t feel 
appropriate. Ironically I found her outside on the stairs, watching 
the sun slowly vanishing under the horizon. Contrary to her usual 
carefree... okay, VERY carefree attitude where almost seemed to be a 
solemn air around her now. I wondered, if she thought of her home 
world, I certainly would.
	&quot;Funny, Willow told me Buffy often used to sit out here when 
she wanted to be alone.&quot; Without another word I set down beside the 
redhead. Outwardly she really appeared to be around Dawn&#39;s age at 
best, physically that might be even true, but when you looked in her 
eyes, you could see a maturity there usually only acquired with life 
on a hellmouth. Lina continued to stare ahead for awhile. A car drove 
by and I could tell her eyes were tracing its movements. &quot;That world 
is strange.&quot; I arched an eyebrow at her. &quot;But that isn&#39;t really 
surprising. After all your grasp and handling of magic is probably as 
old-fashioned and backward as our almost non-existent 
tech...technology. Yes. I saw some in the outer world when the 
barrier fell, but my homeland is nothing like...&quot; She made a wide 
hand gesture including street lamps, the street with a few cars 
passing by and the near general area. &quot;... this.&quot;
	I was surprised. They didn&#39;t have any technology there? No 
lights, no warm water, no... Well, I suppose with light and small 
fire spells that basically anybody somewhat talented could cast that 
wasn&#39;t really necessary. But... A chuckle interrupted my 
thoughts. &quot;And I haven&#39;t even seen the BIG cities. Except in that 
handy entertainment box.&quot; Handy... Oh, she meant the TV.
	I laughed softly and after that another few minutes of 
silence followed in which I wondered how to best approach the 
subject. &quot;So,&quot; I asked carefully. &quot;Are you going to teach us some 
useful magic? Since we are using lousy spells.&quot; Lina looked at me for 
the first time, rather seriously too. &quot;I didn&#39;t say, you&#39;re concept 
of magic was lousy. It is just... Too simple and requires long 
casting time for most of the basic spells I could do without even 
really thinking about it. It is simply not useful in real combat or 
if you have to quickly heal a person. Do you understand?&quot; I nodded, 
that made sense after all. You could be the best wiccan but still 
needed to actually cast the spell for healing. Lina showed us last 
night that she didn&#39;t even need to chant for this and was doing it 
remarkable enough to put every high class healer of this world to 
shame.
	&quot;But that isn&#39;t what worries you,&quot; the young sorceress 
inquired softly, as if she already knew what was really bothering me. 
Maybe she even did. &quot;No... It&#39;s... about Willow. She was totally 
excited about you in school today and stuff. You know, she&#39;s really 
good and all. Much better than I could ever hope to be. But lately... 
I-I just... She w-worries me. I-I fear t-that...&quot; Damn, I was 
slipping into stutter mode again. I had gotten much better lately but 
whenever it came to uncomfortable topics, especially such topics 
regarding my girlfriend... &quot;You&#39;re afraid that she gets to over-
confident and might end up doing something... stupid?&quot; A nod. More I 
could not manage.
	Lina sighed deeply. &quot;Willow... has been tainted with black 
magic, right?&quot; Another nod. &quot;D-During Glory&#39;s.... When we thought 
Glory, she... she robbed me my sanity, my mind. I remember only f-
flashes but... She got really upset.&quot; Lina rubbed her jaw 
thoughtfully. &quot;Hm, I guess that can function as a trigger, at least 
addiction out of love is easier to counter. She must really love 
you.&quot; That one hurt because it went straight home. I dropped my head 
and stared at the ground. &quot;That might not even be important anymore. 
Just... Just help her, okay?&quot;
	I could feel her eyes on me but resisted to meet her 
gaze. &quot;What do you mean it doesn&#39;t matter anymore. You guys are... 
together, right? From the sounds of this your bond must be really 
strong, why would you...?&quot; Before she could speak any further, I held 
up a hand to silence her. &quot;Oh, she loves me, I know that. THAT time 
states it more than clearly. But I think Buffy&#39;s... disappearance 
might have broken the seal she had kept on her feelings for so long.&quot;
	&quot;Seal...?&quot; I almost laughed at her surprised tone. &quot;Just a 
metaphor.&quot; Silence. &quot;Oh,&quot; the other girl finally remarked. And after 
a short pause with a bit more realization. &quot;Oh!&quot; Sadly I faced her 
again. &quot;Yeah...&quot; There was not really anything needed to be said but 
strangely enough I felt myself opening to the other girl. &quot;I love 
her, with all my heart, That is why I don&#39;t want to see her hurt 
through the magic thing. But Buffy... I can&#39;t compete there. They had 
known each other since she came here in High School. Buffy made 
Willow what she is today, in a way.&quot; I closed my eyes at the familiar 
pain, rushing through me. &quot;I could never compete there and I wouldn&#39;t 
even dare. All I want is for Willow to be happy.&quot; For a second I 
thought an almost wistful look crossed the mage&#39;s features, she laid 
a hand comfortingly on her shoulder. &quot;You must love her very much.&quot; 
Then rather casual she added: &quot;Did you ever consider to share?&quot;
	The suddenness and speed of my answer surprised me probably 
more than Lina. &quot;Maybe.&quot; If it wasn&#39;t such a serious topic I would 
have laughed at the expression on her face. I&#39;m sure she would have 
fallen down, if she hadn&#39;t been sitting already. Instead I chuckled 
ruefully before directing the conversation back to more serious and 
urgent topics. Maybe I just didn&#39;t want to think about what my answer 
implied.
	&quot;Can you help her, please? We can&#39;t really give you anything 
except letting you stay and...&quot; Lina waved her hand 
dismissingly. &quot;That&#39;s alright. Without you, I would be lost here 
anyway. And as it looks I need Dawn to at least have a chance of 
reversing the sweep. However, that needs careful planning and 
shouldn&#39;t be rushed. If what you just told me about Willow&#39;s feelings 
is true, I don&#39;t know what she would dare to risk. I&#39;ve seen enough 
people became a vessel of magic instead of the magic becoming a tool 
to the wielder. I have been there myself a few times. And with her 
potential, I really don&#39;t want her as an enemy. Don&#39;t worry, Tara, I 
will train her and she will become a fine sorceress. A student I can 
be and you should be proud of. I promise.&quot;
	Apparently Lina had given that more thought than I gave her 
credit for. Nonetheless, her promise made my heart a little lighter. 
The redhead looked into the sky again and I noticed that the sun had 
almost set. &quot;We should patrol, huh?&quot; Lina nodded quietly. &quot;Yes, but 
not you and not Willow.&quot; At my surprised look she added: &quot;She doesn&#39;t 
need to get any dumb ideas about flashy fire spells and destructive 
enchantments. Your girlfriend is very eager but she is also very 
confident, TOO confident. We will work on this first before we begin 
anything. Magic is not a plaything. If you can&#39;t learn REAL control 
first, it can eat you... or those around you.&quot;
	With that Lina stood up and soothed her cloak carefully. I 
took the offered hand and let her pull me to my feet. &quot;You remind me 
of someone I know. We are calling people like you Shrine Maidens. 
They serve the Gods in our world. You will be a very powerful one 
someday.&quot; I blushed at the sincere compliment. Willow used to do that 
to cheer me up when I felt useless. But hearing that from someone so 
much better than any of us. &quot;Th-Thank you.&quot; I think, Willow and the 
rest of us were in good hands. Lina Inverse might be younger than us 
but she could be as serious as an elder. Yes, I was sure that she 
would do her best to bring Willow on the right path.

(Amelia)
The night was clear and the Moon shone brightly down on the Earth 
below. Compared to what we had recently gone through the world seemed 
like the very description of paradise. Peaceful and without any care. 
I wondered, if anyone ever knew how close the world had come to 
Armageddon. How close Valgaarv had come to achieve his goal... We 
would most likely not live very long to earn any of this fame. That 
hardly seemed fair, especially to Lina, whose sacrifice would never 
receive the proper respect. Much as it had been with Shabranigdu&#39;s 
part or Copy Rezo or Gaav or Fibrizo... We hadn&#39;t thought that battle 
for fame but it seemed unfair that people&#39;s opinions about Lina 
especially would never change. They judged her by all her quirks and 
little character flows but only a handful of people knew that deep 
down Lina was a truly good-hearted person.
Pondering this I lay awake, staring up in the sky and unable to 
sleep. The rest of the group didn&#39;t have this problems but I simply 
couldn&#39;t get my mind to rest. It is incredible how much you can miss 
a person without even realizing before that you would. Lina had been 
in the better part of the last year&#39;s adventures. Without her, I 
would probably still be wandering around with my father, thinking how 
good a hero I was. Lina had revised my opinion of skill. I had 
admired her from the day I met her and although we often fought both 
of us knew who the better sorceress of us was. I missed her terribly 
but I still couldn&#39;t really figure out why it hurt so damn much.
&quot;It&#39;s not, as if she is never coming back. I mean, we are talking 
about Lina here, she always finds a way.&quot; And yet every moment I 
spent thinking about her and called up the memory when she was torn 
into the dimensional vortex while releasing her deadliest spell... 
Why did she have to this to me? Why was I acting like an emotional 
wreck? Alright, I did blame myself for being so careless but she 
didn&#39;t have to react that badly. Why had she reacted so badly? &quot;Damn 
her,&quot; I cursed silently. I couldn&#39;t get her out my mind.
&quot;Is it so hard to accept your own feelings?&quot; I turned around startled 
and found Zelgadis sitting upright across the fire. I squinted in the 
darkness to make out his face for any clues but the dim fire cast 
eerie shadows over his chimera skin which made it even more difficult 
to read anything in his usual stoic gaze. &quot;What do you mean? Accept 
my feelings? What feelings?&quot; Zelgadis laughed quietly but even with 
the low sound level I could tell that the laugh was very bitter which 
caught me by surprise. &quot;That you love her.&quot;
Silence. Only the sounds of nature all around us could be heard but I 
paid them no mind. Zelgadis casual statement hit home like a 
thunderbolt, shocking me deep to the core. There was no mistaking 
from what kind of love he was speaking and I was not stupid enough to 
interpret anything else into his word. Still, the prospect that I... 
It seemed so unnaturally, so bizarre, so totally hilarious. &quot;I... 
I...&quot; However... I found myself unable to deny as a series of 
memories unbidden began to well up in my mind, reminding me of how 
much my feelings to the young sorceress had changed over the years.
At first it had been admiration. After the first time that I saw Lina 
casting her Dragu Slave, I began to idolize her, I wanted to be like 
her. She was a great sorceress, a hero in my mind&#39;s eye. Later on my 
view slightly began to change. I was irritated when my idol did many 
things that were so unlike a hero. I had been shocked to learn that 
she and Zelgadis were wanted for some dubious crime. But again Lina 
surprised me and I soon learned that I could not only listen to the 
opinions of others, I had to make my own. And that I did.
I had witnessed Lina dealing with the threat of Copy Rezo, Gaav and 
Fibrizo. She was not like the hero I had pictured myself. She had 
faults and was probably more human than the most normal people, with 
an always hungry stomach and a greediness for money. However, she did 
take her responsibilities serious. Although her methods often seemed 
dubious and unusual, often overdone, Lina Inverse had stood up to 
beings I would have run away from a few years ago when I had just 
heard their names. That was when my feelings had changed to respect. 
A deep, unyielding respect.
Then... Yes, then we had been pulled into another adventure together 
and I had wondered how glad I was to travel around with Lina again... 
although I would have never admitted it. During our quest to fulfill 
Filia&#39;s prophecy I had been more aware of Lina than ever. I had taken 
notice of all the small things. When she used to smile, became upset, 
was enthusiastic. I was doing all this rather subconsciously and was 
unaware of how much attention I had actually paid. Until now I never 
really had to deal with any emotional issues of this kind. I was 
still very young after all, much like Filia I had yet to learn a lot. 
Also I always figured that as a princess, I would probably marry some 
rich lord or something later on that my father elected for me. And 
still, somehow, without me even really noticing, I... had fallen in 
love with Lina Inverse.
&quot;Wow,&quot; I breathed, unable to say anything more. The revelation had 
struck me dumbfounded. I had not been aware of how great the impact 
was Lina had made in my life. In a way she was still my idol, my 
hero. But she had redefined my own description of that terms. She was 
perfectly suited for me. It did not matter, if she had her faults, in 
my eyes that only made her more human and therefore something I could 
look up to. Something I could try to achieve for myself.
&quot;Shocking, huh?&quot; I looked back at Zelgadis and suddenly realized 
something else. We had also come closer recently. First, I thought 
that was because of our similar familiarity with the Spiritual 
Shamanism. Our powers kind of harmonized and under his stoic mask 
Zelgadis really wasn&#39;t that bad. That he was a Chimera didn&#39;t bother 
me. Ever since meeting Lina I was far from judging a person by 
prejudices. But, compared to Lina, there never was anything between 
us. At least not from my side. Had I given him the wrong impression?
&quot;Zelgadis...&quot; I stopped puzzled, when I saw that he had stood up, his 
things slung over his shoulder. &quot;I wish you good luck and hope that 
you find a way to bring Lina back.&quot; With that he turned around, about 
ready to go. My mind raced but I could not really find any words at 
the moment. &quot;Wait!&quot; I called out softly. Zelgadis stopped briefly and 
looked back at me. It annoyed me to no end that I couldn&#39;t see his 
face. I had no idea what he was feeling. Betrayed? Angry? Sad? I had 
no idea. &quot;You... You are leaving us? Now?&quot; All I could make out was a 
nod. &quot;There is no need for me to go back with you. It is highly 
unlikely that I will ever find a cure there. If I stay here, maybe I 
find something in the outside world. I... I&#39;m sorry.&quot;
With that and without another word he turned around and vanished into 
the night, his form melting with the shadows. I sat for awhile, 
stunned at the turn of events and the sudden revelations that were 
being made. &quot;Goodbye,&quot; I whispered finally, the wind carrying my 
whisper away moments after leaving my lips. &quot;And good luck to you 
too, Zelgadis.&quot;

(Dawn)
I was used to silence in the evening - especially when Buffy went out 
on patrol. Ever since Mom left us the house had been unusually quiet. 
It had begun with the little things, like hearing my mutual mother 
prepare breakfast in the kitchen, rustling around the house to do 
this and that, coming home from work. Some of the days I would have 
come home and nobody was there. Buffy would usually be with her 
friends discussing matters concerning Glory. It saddened me every 
time when I came into the empty house knowing that I would not be 
expected from anyone. It felt, as if I was some kind of intruder.
Then there were the bigger things too. Like having no one around to 
care for you, to go to with your problems. True, Buffy had been great 
in assuring me that despite being the Key she WAS my sister and I had 
believed her. However, Buffy was not Mom. She tried, yes, but I never 
really expected her to replace Joyce from one day to another. Besides 
being the Slayer she still was barely out of her teens. I have never 
been aware of how much I would miss both Mom and my sister before 
they were gone. Both now.
The silence tonight was a little more relaxed and for the first time 
since Mom died, I was grateful for it. The house had been bursting 
with activity ever since Buffy and Lina switched dimension, courtesy 
of me. Lina was cool. She was a really good witch... err, sorceress. 
She was around my age but still rather mature for that except certain 
aspects of her character. I instantly grew to like her and I could 
see that both Tara and Willow respected her greatly, although Willow 
had been slightly muffled at being excluded from patrol tonight. 
Giles was a little wary of the new addition to the team, but then 
again he was an adult, they always saw things differently. I had no 
idea what Xander and Anya&#39;s opinions were since they had only been 
there on patrol yesterday and hadn&#39;t managed to come today. Tara and 
Willow had quickly decided to move in with us since they could hardly 
leave me alone in the house and Lina was to young to pose as some 
sort of legal guardian if necessary. I was relieved about the 
addition to the household since it greatly lifted the uneasy silence.
Currently I was glad about the calm though since it gave me some time 
to relax. The day had been hectic. Lina had to be get introduced to 
life in Sunnydale and settled in with us. After all we had no idea 
how long she would stay and it was essentially to be comfortable. 
Especially given the rate how everything around here tended to fall 
apart. Currently Tara and I were comfortably seated in the large 
couch and watching some comedy. None of us really paid that much 
attention. I had much to think about as did Tara. I could see it in 
her distant look. Her and Willow had been a bit touchy around each 
other ever since Tara&#39;s sanity had been restored. I could not help 
noticing this, but was reluctant to approach the topic yet.
&quot;So, what do you think Buffy is doing right now?&quot; I almost jumped as 
the silence was broken and frowned at the unusual question. I could 
see that Tara probably thought I was worried for my sister and tried 
to lighten the mood. Which was true, I did miss Buffy. But if there 
was one truth in my faked memory, when it was that Buffy always 
managed to adept to ANY situation. &quot;She&#39;s probably kicking some 
monsters ass right now and impressing the hell out of Lina&#39;s 
friends.&quot; Tara could not help a chuckle. &quot;Yeah. I guess you are 
right.&quot;
Another period of silence followed in which both of us followed the 
movie only partially. &quot;Do you miss her?&quot; I nodded silently. Buffy was 
the only family I had left, at least by blood. In truth, I was 
actually her, since I had been made from her. As she said: Summer&#39;s 
blood. The fact that she was able to close the vortex was prove 
enough for that statement. I could not imagine what would happened, 
if we never got her back. I didn&#39;t WANT to imagine.
The quiet was broken again as we heard the front door open. Shortly 
after Lina and Giles were coming in. The redheaded sorceress 
immediately looked around, as if expecting something. &quot;Hey, Lina, 
Giles, how went patrol?&quot; I asked cautiously. Lina seemed slightly 
agitated and Giles was well... Giles. &quot;We had no problems. Though I 
must say that Miss Inverse&#39;s use of magic is...&quot; Interrupting the 
Watcher&#39;s rant that was sure to follow, Lina leveled her gaze at 
us. &quot;Where is Willow?&quot;
&quot;Upstairs. She said she wanted to go through some of her spells. 
Why?&quot; Tara answered the question. I was confused myself. If I 
wouldn&#39;t know better, I was sure that Lina looked... troubled. There 
seemed to be some kind of silent conversation between the wiccan and 
the sorceress. Suddenly realization crept into the blonde&#39;s eyes and 
a slight gasp escaped her mouth. &quot;She wouldn&#39;t...&quot; That only further 
confused me.
&quot;What&#39;s going on here?&quot; I didn&#39;t receive an answer as Lina turned 
around and hurried upstairs. Tara rose with the clear intent to 
follow but Giles put a restraining hand on her shoulder and simply 
shook her head. &quot;Let her handle this. As much as I hate to admit it, 
Lina knows what she is doing.&quot; Reluctantly Tara calmed down and 
leaned back with a sigh. &quot;Would someone please tell me what is going 
on?&quot; I asked irritated.
Again any attempt of explanation was interrupted as both Giles and 
Tara stiffened suddenly and hurried outside. I was far from 
questioning their behavior as I had felt an extreme uneasiness all of 
a sudden. We arrived on the front porch just in time to see a giant 
red streak of power penetrate the air resulting in a colossal 
explosion just outside of Sunnydale. I stood there, mouth agape, 
staring unbelievable at the spectacle. &quot;Wh-What was that?&quot; I finally 
choked out when I had somewhat recovered from the following shockwave.
&quot;That, I assume,&quot; Giles answered in a deathly quiet voice, &quot;was a 
lesson about what magic can do and what consequences and price it 
has.&quot; Suddenly I did not feel that sure anymore, if I really wanted 
to learn some of the cool stuff Willow and Tara could do.

(Willow)
You&#39;re not coming. That was all she had said. Why that arrogant, 
egoistical witch! Who the heck did she think she was? Just because 
she had some ultra cool magic that could make the hellmouth itself 
shiver in fear, who was she to tell me what I could do and could 
not?!? She could not simply forbid me to go on patrol or not, that 
was my fight too, my choice, my DAMN RESPONSIBILITY! I had to watch 
out for them, I was - usual lack of self-conscious be damned - the 
strongest out of the remaining Scoobies! I had to be there, I had to 
make sure Buffy&#39;s work in the last couple of years wasn&#39;t for naught. 
Who the hell died and made Lina boss?
	My face changed into a grimace at this last line of thought. 
Ok, bad choice, Rosenberg. As if on cue my mood considerably darkened 
and went from angry to simply depressed. Buffy was gone and it was 
our task to continue her fight. When I saw her yesterday I was so 
excited. All day I had looked forward to see some more of the younger 
girl&#39;s magic. I was sure, if she just gave me a few tips, I could 
master it. I mean, with that kind of magic, I would be a great asset 
when Buffy returned... If Buffy returned...
	A tear ran down my cheek and I wiped it away angrily. 
Flipping through a few more pages, I finally found what I was looking 
for. True, Buffy was surely not dead, that I would know. We had known 
each other so long, if something would ever happen to the other one 
we would feel it. With that possibility out of the way I was spared 
the painful ritual of a restoration spell, the only one I had found 
so far. It was not particular pretty and would have led to serious 
troubles with the others. Not that I wouldn&#39;t have been able to pull 
it off, of course. But that wasn&#39;t necessary anymore.
	A smile began to show on my face. I had finally found what I 
was looking for. After a few hours of researching I had already 
stumbled across a few spells which could work in bringing Buffy back 
to us. But all of them needed to first locate the target and 
establish some kind of anchor, that was the real problem. I might 
have found something now. Although it didn&#39;t look very pretty either, 
the spell had the benefit that I didn&#39;t need to involve anyone, not 
even Dawnie. Lina could do what pleased her. I, for my part, wanted 
Buffy back. And I wanted her back now. Life without her just wasn&#39;t 
the same. Afterwards everything could go back to normal...
	With a loud crash the door swung open. Startled I looked up, 
expecting Tara or Dawn who were downstairs watching TV. Instead I 
found red eyes locked on my own with barely restrained intensity. 
Lina did not bother to say anything, then she stalked over to me and 
before I could say anything she snatched the book I had quickly hid 
behind my back away with relative ease. Since I had held the page 
open - which I must admit was stupid - the younger sorceress did only 
need to take one look before she tossed it out of the window and to 
my utter horror send a fireball right after it.
	&quot;WHY...?&quot; I started but was interrupted by an eruption of 
temper I had not expected. &quot;Are you crazy? Do you have any idea what 
that would have done to you? It appears you really have a death wish, 
Rosenberg! This stuff is poison. Even I would not touch it and I knew 
enough about what consequences Black Magic can have!&quot; My own temper 
flared in response as I saw my only hope for getting Buffy back burn 
to ashes. &quot;So do you? I say you give a shit about what we feel! You 
are acting all tough and big, saying that you help us until we find a 
way to reverse the sweep! What do you know about consequences? We 
have practically devoted our lives to Buffy and her fight, we have 
dealt with countless problems over the years, we damn well know the 
risks and I am prepared to pay what it takes to get Buffy back! I can 
do it!&quot; I felt tears staining my anger-clouded vision but I didn&#39;t 
care. &quot;I want Buffy back, without her it is just not the same. Seeing 
her jump through that vortex, for a brief moment confronted with the 
though that she really was dead... You have no idea what that feels 
like.&quot;
	The force of the slap took me by surprise since Lina clearly 
stated the night before that she was not a very good physical 
fighter. When I turned back to face her, I flinched at the underlying 
pain in this otherwise totally cold and dead serious eyes. &quot;You are a 
fool, if you think, you understand ANYTHING about consequences and 
risks.&quot; Without a further word or waiting for a response she grapped 
my arm and mumbled a few words. Before I knew it we were already 
flying up to the roof of a nearby tall building. Lina sat us down and 
walked towards one side of the roof. I didn&#39;t dare to speak, my eyes 
curiously following her movements. The steps were determined, her 
pose serious and at the moment not at all fierce. No, at the moment 
she was the perfect equivalent to a shark, cold, calculating and 
waiting to strike. By all means I should at least ready myself for 
any assault that might come but somehow knew that wasn&#39;t why we were 
up here. And, in all honesty, I would not stand a second against 
someone like Lina.
	&quot;Observe.&quot; The young sorceress began to glow faintly as she 
stood there, arms raised and her hands in an unfamiliar pose in front 
of her face. Power was building all around us, incredible power. 
Unbelievable power!
	&quot;Darkness from twilight, crimson from blood that flows; 
buried in the flow of time; in Thy great name, I pledge myself to 
darkness! Those who oppose us shall be destroyed by the power you and 
I possess!&quot; I gasped as the orb of crimson magic formed between her 
now cupped hands, glowing and swirling, full of massive power only 
waiting to be released. Released... Suddenly I became aware of how 
high we were over the town and if she wanted Lina could easily...
	Pointing her hands downwards I could only stare in shock as 
the crimson ball expanded again in size and the utterly unbelievable 
power again rose. I was sure every sensitive creature in the whole 
town was standing still at the moment and I was quite sure that all 
the Scoobies were standing in front of the Summer&#39;s house staring in 
our direction. Yet, I could only stare. &quot;DRAGU SLAVE!&quot; In the last 
possible moment Lina redirected her hands and instead of the 
unsuspecting town below the resulting beam of crimson energy leapt 
forward and finally erupted in a formation of smaller hills not far 
away from the town, completely flattening them. A tremor shook the 
Earth below and sudden cries of panic could be heard below. I did 
tune all this out as I stared with wide eyes at Lina. I could not 
betray myself, at the moment I felt an icy fear grip my heart 
confronted with the utter destructive power this girl wielded with an 
ease that almost seemed idle.
	Lina turned around, her expression not changed, not 
wavering. &quot;I could have let this slip. Only the Lady knows how often 
I did before. I could have destroyed this town, if I wanted to do. I 
ask you now one question and answer me seriously, Willow. Could you 
have done the same?&quot; The question in itself was ridiculous really. I 
never felt so frightened before, I never felt so insecure, so unsure 
of myself. Not even before I met Buffy, not even after countless 
years of being the school nerd, the looser. I realized with a 
shocking clarity how much I had taken for granted what my life had 
become. I had worked so hard to be what I was now... Buffy worked so 
hard to boost my self-confidence. How could I betray her like that? 
Of course I was good, of course I had become powerful, of course 
Buffy herself had labeled me her &quot;secret weapon&quot;. However... Was I 
really ready for that kind of responsibility. Could I really ever be 
that good? Could I live with myself knowing that even the tiniest 
slip in concentration could effect everyone around me? The answer was 
simple and crashed down heavily on my over-confidence of the last few 
weeks since I had first touched the Black Magic books in order to 
avenge Tara. I could not speak as I felt empty and my mouth dry, so I 
simply shook my head in the negative.
	For a long moment Lina eyes remained resting on me. Then 
finally her gaze softened a bit and she relaxed a little. Turning 
around she once more looked out over the town. &quot;Good. Your training 
begins tomorrow.&quot;

TBC

Next time:

More about the Slayers world, Buffy and Amelia get to know each other 
better.  Also Willow begins her lessons under Lina as do the other 
Scoobies. And, of course, no event as major as that can occur without 
a great evil involved, right? Stay tuned for Chapter two!

Author&#39;s Notes

Phew, I finished it. The first chapter is finally complete. I did 
have a sudden burst of inspiration for this and I think I managed to 
do rather well now. At first I was not really satisfied with the 
partially release I had made to the BuffyWantsWillow list but the 
last scenes rounded things up nicely. I think I can leave this 
chapter as it is.
A few things I like to clear up now.
I must apologize for the quick and certainly a bit unfair disposal of 
Xellos. It just simply happened. I wanted to create a situation that 
really shocked the group to the core. Not only Amelia&#39;s injuries, 
that would have not really been enough. With the death of another I 
figured that would be the best way. Xellos was sort of exceptional to 
my plans, you will see this later. Again, I apologize for anyone who 
I offended with the quick disposal of the Mazoku.
What Lina thought about the different effects of casting the Giga 
Slave with different talismans, was a suspicion of mine. We see Lina 
casting the Giga Slave against Shabranigdu/Rezo the first time. She 
just invented it, without any knowledge of the consequences. Yet, she 
managed to cast it on the Sword of Light and succeed, only suffering 
a magical drain. The second time against Fibrizo she used her 
talismans that were more or less directly linked to the Lady and lost 
control. Maybe that is an explanation for it but I figured it might 
also be because the Sword of Light was a weapon of a Demon Lord from 
one of the other four worlds. The talismans though are sort of 
directly gifted from the Lord of Nightmares and could manage to 
channel her power. The combination of both might have been too much 
and therefore instead of casting a controlled Giga Slave, acted as a 
call to the creator instead. It is just a theory, mind you.
If some of you wonder about Lina&#39;s sudden maturity level, please 
consider that she has just been thrown into another world/dimension 
that was so unlike any other. It would not do her any good do get on 
the wrong side of the only people she knew where. Also I think that 
fighting all this battles must have made her somewhat more mature. 
Oh, don&#39;t worry. We will see Lina causing some havoc in Sunnydale in 
later chapters. Wouldn&#39;t be Lina otherwise. *Looks around and 
sweatdrops when receiving glare from a fuming Lina* Ehehe... Never 
mind.

That&#39;s about everything for the first chapter. Please send your 
comments. Good or bad, whatever they are. Constructive criticism is 
essentially for an author.

Ja ne, yours
