<h1>The Slayers Matrix (part 8 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hawk.html">Hawk Shadowharper</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../slayers/matrix-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>           Night has fallen on the Dragon Slayer, or at least most of 
the lights are off. Tapping at various screens and controls, Zelgadis 
sits at Hawk&#39;s station, the green lines of Matrix code scrolling down 
the three main monitors in front of him. Sighing to himself, he 
catches something out of the corner of his eye and looks. Lina. 
&quot;Whoa!&quot; She jumps a little. &quot;Lina... you scared the bejesus out of 
me.&quot; 
           &quot;Sorry,&quot; she replied, pulling the blanket curled around her 
shoulders a bit tighter. 
           &quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; he says, absently glancing around the vacant 
deck and taps another button, all the screens going blank besides the 
three center ones. Lina looks at the black screens then to the main 
ones still on. 
           &quot;Is that...?&quot; 
           &quot;The Matrix? Yeah.&quot; She leans a little closer. 
           &quot;Do you always look at it encoded?&quot; 
           &quot;Well, you have to. The images translators work for the 
Construct program, but there&#39;s way too much information to decode the 
Matrix. You get used to it, I don&#39;t even see the code. All I see is 
blonde, brunette, redhead,&quot; Zel notes as he points at each screen in 
turn. Lina rolls her eyes. &quot;Hey,&quot; the metal-haired man looks back at 
Lina with a growing grin, &quot;You want a drink?&quot; 
           &quot;Sure.&quot; He leans down and picks up a plastic jug from the 
floor beside him, pouring some into a cup for Lina. 
           &quot;You know, I know what you&#39;re thinking, cause right now I&#39;m 
thinking the same thing.&quot; He hands her the cup. &quot;Actually, I&#39;ve been 
thinking it ever since I got here. &#39;Why oh why didn&#39;t I take the BLUE 
pill&#39;?&quot; Lina watches Zelgadis a moment then takes a gulp from the cup. 
Immediately it sets her throat on fire and she coughs, a bit surprised 
at the potency. He chuckles and claps her shoulder with a blue-skinned 
hand, &quot;Good shit, huh? Gourry makes it. Good for two things: 
degreasing engines and killing brain cells.&quot; She shakes her head, 
looking up at Zel after taking another sip. 
           &quot;Do you mind if I ask you something, Zelgadis?&quot; He shakes 
his head, though by his expression he already knows what she&#39;s going 
to ask. &quot;Why are you... like that? I mean, the hair and such.&quot; He 
laughs shortly, crossing his arms as he looks back at the Matrix 
screens. 
           &quot;The short answer is I&#39;m an experiment. The Dragons played 
with my DNA and made me like this.&quot; He sighs, apparently still upset 
about the idea. &quot;As far as we know, they&#39;ve done these experiments on 
others, too. I&#39;m the only one to be let out of the power plant who&#39;s 
had them done.&quot; 
           &quot;So inside the Matrix, your RSI is the same as if you never 
were changed,&quot; she thinks out loud to herself. 
           &quot;That&#39;s right.&quot; He sighs again then looks back at Lina, 
&quot;While we&#39;re on the subject, could I ask you something too? Did he 
tell you why he did it? Why you&#39;re here?&quot; She watches Zel then looks 
down at her cup, hesitating before nodding. He doesn&#39;t like the answer 
and looks up at the ceiling in disbelief, &quot;Jeez-us! What a mind job,&quot; 
he mutters, then slides his gaze back to her, &quot;So, you&#39;re here to save 
the world. What do you say to something like that?&quot; He leans back in 
the chair, continuing. &quot;A little advice. You see an Agent, you do what 
we do: run. You run your ass off. If Xelloss says you can fly, I 
wouldn&#39;t go jumping out any windows to find out if he&#39;s right.&quot; 
           She looks down at her cup, considering, and takes a last 
drink out of it before handing it back, &quot;Thanks for the drink.&quot; Lina 
heads back to her room, Zel watching her go. 
           &quot;Sweet dreams.&quot; 

--- 

           The view: magnificent. The food: extraordinary. The prices: 
non-existent. 
           &quot;Do we have a deal, Mr. Magnus?&quot; 
           The patrons: unlikely. 
           Zelgadis cuts a cube of steak from his dinner and lifts it 
up, and then he looks at it almost in wonder. &quot;You know... I know this 
steak doesn&#39;t exist,&quot; he begins, glancing over the savory meat across 
to Valgarv sharing the table with him. &quot;I know that when I put it in 
my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy, and 
delicious. After nine years, you know what I realize?&quot; He pops the 
chunk of meat into his mouth and chews, thoughtful before releasing a 
sigh. &quot;Ignorance is bliss.&quot; 
           Valgarv watches through his sunglasses, face like stone and 
revealing nothing. &quot;Then we have a deal.&quot; Behind Zel, a waitress 
squeezes skin lotion into her hand while he leans back. 
           &quot;I want to remember nothing.&quot; He glances at the Dragon, 
making sure, &quot;Nothing. Do you understand?&quot; Valgarv lowers his head 
slightly. Zelgadis closes his eyes as the waitress starts to rub the 
lotion into his face, another content sigh leaving him. &quot;And I want to 
be rich, you know, someone important... like a legendary celebrity.&quot; 
           &quot;Whatever you want, Mr. Magnus.&quot; Zel thinks for several 
moments more as the cream is rubbed into his face. The feeling of 
normal skin again distracts Zel from the memory of his true form still 
on the Dragon Slayer. 
           &quot;Okay... You get my body back in the power plant, reinsert 
me into the Matrix, I&#39;ll get you what you want.&quot; 
           &quot;Access codes to the Sairaag defense net,&quot; Valgarv responds 
with a dark smirk. Zel&#39;s eyes pop open as he looks at the Dragon 
again. 
           &quot;No, I told you, I don&#39;t know them. I can get you the man 
who does...&quot; 
           &quot;Xelloss.&quot; Zel hesitates and glances at the Dragon, then 
closes his eyes once more and allows the massage to resume.

           &quot;There you go, Lina, breakfast of champions.&quot; She looks 
down at the bowl Hawk slides in front of her. The contents look like 
creamed corn that&#39;s been put through a blender set to liquefy. 
           &quot;If you close your eyes, it almost feels like you&#39;re eating 
runny eggs,&quot; Phibrizio remarks helpfully. 
           &quot;Yeah, or a bowl of snot,&quot; Garv mutters. Eris, beside him, 
smiles a bit. Seraya, the last person on Lina and Phibrizio&#39;s side of 
the table doesn&#39;t comment. 
           &quot;Do you know what it really reminds me of,&quot; Phibby asks no 
one as he looks up at the ceiling thoughtfully. &quot;Tastee Wheat. Did you 
ever eat Tastee Wheat?&quot; He looks back at Lina with the question. 
           &quot;No, but technically neither did you,&quot; Eris answers for the 
redhead. 
           &quot;That&#39;s exactly my point, exactly,&quot; the boy exclaims. The 
wheels are already turning behind his eyes, as this is something he&#39;s 
thought a lot about. &quot;Because you have to wonder, how do the Dragons 
really know what Tastee Wheat tasted like? Maybe they got it wrong. 
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat tasted like, actually tasted like, uh, 
oatmeal, or tuna fish. It makes you wonder about a lot of things. You 
take chicken for example, maybe they couldn&#39;t figure out what to make 
chicken taste like, which is why chicken tastes like everything. And 
maybe they--&quot; 
           &quot;SHUT UP!&quot; Eris rubs her ear after Garv sits down following 
his outburst. 
           &quot;It&#39;s a single-cell protein, combined with synthetic 
aminos, vitamins, and minerals. Everything the body needs,&quot; Gourry 
informs Lina about her breakfast. 
           &quot;It doesn&#39;t have &#39;everything the body needs&#39;,&quot; Phibrizio 
grumbles in a mocking tone then looks towards Lina who&#39;s slowly but 
surely eating her bowl of runny eggs/Tastee Wheat/snot. He scoots 
closer with a knowing grin. &quot;So, I understand that you&#39;ve run through 
the Agent training program.&quot; She nods. &quot;You know, I wrote that 
program.&quot; Seraya groans from her corner of the table. 
           &quot;Not this again, Phibrizio,&quot; she begs the boy as the others 
exchange knowing looks. He ignores the blond woman. 
           &quot;So, what did you think of her,&quot; he asks with a sly grin. 
           &quot;Of who?&quot; 
           &quot;The woman in the white dress. I designed her,&quot; he informs 
Lina proudly. &quot;Her name&#39;s Zelas. She, ah, she doesn&#39;t talk very much, 
but if you&#39;d like to meet her, I can arrange a much more personal 
milieu,&quot; he grins and winks at Lina, who&#39;s staring back at him in 
disbelief. 
           &quot;The digital pimp hard at work,&quot; Eris comments as she rolls 
her eyes. 
           &quot;Pay no attention to these hypocrites, Lina. To deny our 
own impulses is to deny the very thing that make us human,&quot; he notes 
wisely then smiles brightly, going back to his breakfast. At the 
impulse comment, Seraya glances up to Phibrizio and Lina sitting on 
the same side of the table. The redhead, on the other hand, has 
snapped out of her horrified expression and jumps to her feet. 
           &quot;What impulses are you talking about, you little--&quot; The 
door squeaks loudly open, protecting Phibrizio from Lina&#39;s wrath. 
Xelloss looks in. 
           &quot;Gourry, when you&#39;re done, bring the ship up to broadcast 
depth. We&#39;re going in,&quot; he informs the crew, glancing around at all 
their faces. &quot;I&#39;m taking Lina to see her.&quot; He disappears from the 
small dining room, and Lina looks down to Hawk still sitting across 
the table beside Eris. 
           &quot;To see who?&quot; 
           &quot;The Oracle,&quot; the operator replies quietly. Seraya&#39;s gaze 
rises up to look across and meet Zel&#39;s eyes.
