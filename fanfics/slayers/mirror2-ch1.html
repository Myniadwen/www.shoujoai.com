<h1>Mirrors: Chapter 13</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The single room was comfortable, if a bit small, but
it clearly wasn&#39;t designed for two women to share.
Naga took off her heavy outer cloak, her simple tunic
and long pants hugging her shapely form as she quietly
said, &quot;Lina, you take the bed.&quot; The warrior smiled
slightly, &quot;I&#39;ll take the floor.&quot;

&#39;Wow,&#39; Lina blinked, feeling her heart skip a beat.
Naga was nearly a head taller than her, and the other
woman was built accordingly with wider hips and large,
well shaped breasts. Breasts, Lina had to admit, that
she was noticing more and more.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Naga asked quietly, her short
black hair falling away from her handsome face and the
cloak still dangling from her hand.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Lina answered, trying to recover her poise
even as a faint blushed colored her cheeks at her wild
thoughts. &quot;You don&#39;t need to use the floor, you know,&quot;
she said quietly, &quot;we&#39;ll fit in the bed together, if a
bit snugly.&quot;

Naga hesitated, carefully looking down at Lina&#39;s face
a moment then nodded slightly, &quot;If you&#39;re sure, Lina.&quot;
She hung up her cloak on one of the pegs by the door,
then discretely turned her back and began to unlace
her simple top.

With a deeper blush Lina concentrated on not watching
Naga undress even as she began to strip herself of her
own heavy cloak and clothing, her thoughts deeply
confused. She hadn&#39;t been lying when she told Amelia
about loving the original Naga, and more and more she
found herself drawn to this mirror twin. Even
stranger, her feelings seemed different, stronger as
she grew to know this noble and courageous young
woman.

Lina choked back a moan as she saw the now naked Naga
move across the little room. Full breasts bounced
gently, the rosy nipples hardening slightly as she sat
by the side of the bed. Swinging those long, shapely
legs she slip beneath the covers, a momentary glimpse
of a well trimmed dark haired triangle becoming
visible.

Naga held up one edge of the sheet as she saw the now
equally naked Lina hesitate and murmured, &quot;You&#39;ll get
cold, standing there.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Lina murmured as she slipped in beside
the other woman, the little mattress automatically
pressing them close. Her little breasts rubbed up
against Naga&#39;s larger ones, her slim body pressed
against Naga&#39;s curved body. Her own nipples were firm
little points, and Lina knew that she couldn&#39;t blame
it on the cold.

&quot;Lina, I....&quot; Naga started.

Just then Lina began, &quot;Naga I wanted to say....&quot;

Both women looked at each other then began to laugh
softly. In a unconscious move Naga slipped her arm
around Lina&#39;s shoulder, helping make them a bit more
comfortable laying on the little bed. &quot;You first?&quot;
Naga offered with a gentle smile.

&#39;Oh no,&#39; Lina fought down a passionate shudder as
their legs twined together, bodies pressing even
closer on the bed. &quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Lina muttered under
her breath, wondering how she could put what she
wanted to say to Naga into words. She took a breath,
&quot;You know that I didn&#39;t want you along with me, but
did you know why?&quot;

Naga blinked at her in surprise as she answered,
&quot;Because you worried I would be trouble, with my
ethics and morals.&quot;

&quot;That, too,&quot; Lina took a shaky breath, &quot;but that
wasn&#39;t all.&quot; Softly she continued, &quot;The original Naga
and I were friends, and traveled together a long time.
But in the end Naga felt more for me than friendship,
and in my fear I drove her away.&quot;

Naga tried to drew away from her slightly, &quot;Do I
frighten you?&quot;

Lina reached up to grasp a bare arm, the sweet scent
of the other woman washing over her as she looked up
at her, her eyes warm as she softly said, &quot;No.&quot;

A faint blush colored Naga&#39;s cheeks as she gently drew
Lina close to her once again. &quot;I thought that when I
left my Lina I would be heart broken,&quot; she confessed,
&quot;I thought that my life was over.&quot; A wry smile, &quot;I
fought not to like you, Lina, fought to hold on to my
initial dislike.&quot;

&quot;The only time I&#39;m glad to see you loose a battle,&quot;
Lina murmured, face pressed to sweet smelling ski at
the base of Naga&#39;s neck. The urge to nibble, to tease
that skin with her tongue was nearly overwhelming.

Naga chuckled, &quot;Too true.&quot; She held Lina, bringing her
face close to that fiery hair as she softly said, &quot;I
fear I&#39;m falling in love with you, Lina-sama.&quot;

Lina felt her heart skip a beat, a mix of joy and
terror racing through her. Looking up to meet Naga&#39;s
eyes she asked, &quot;Why fear?&quot;

Naga looked troubled as she gently continued, &quot;I loved
your twin for a long time, you know. I wonder if this
is simply confusion, that I&#39;m merely using you to
replace the woman that I love....?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m feeling confused, too,&quot; Lina admitted. She
laughed without much humor, &quot;I made a lot of mistakes
before, this might just be me trying to fix them.&quot;

&quot;So what do you want to do now?&quot;

Lina sighed softly, resting her head against Naga&#39;s
collar. &quot;As much as I&#39;d like to kiss you right now,&quot;
she said softly, &quot;I think we should take things
slowly, for a while. If this is a true feeling we&#39;ll
both know soon enough, and if it&#39;s not we&#39;ll avoid
hurting each other.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a very wise woman, Lina,&quot; Naga smiled,
pressing her lips gently to the top of the woman&#39;s
head, &quot;and as much as I&#39;d like to kiss you, too, I&#39;ll
accept it.&quot;

&quot;No, I think we&#39;re both idiots,&quot; Lina admitted wryly
even as she felt that feather light kiss and struggled
with the urge to turn her face up to meet it.

&quot;Two noble, good-natured idiots,&quot; Naga said agreeably,
her arms tightening to draw Lina even closer to her,
her breath teasing the other girl&#39;s skin.

Lina lay there for a moment, wishing that she wasn&#39;t
so rational, so reasonable about the situation. The
wetness between her legs was driving her mad, the
heady scent of her own passion slowly seeping into
Lina&#39;s brain. She could almost hear Naga&#39;s own heart
bracing, and knew that the other woman felt like she
did.

&quot;I never said I was noble,&quot; Lina finally murmured.

&quot;What...?&quot; Naga questioned.

Not letting herself think about it Lina pushed herself
up, sliding against Naga before pushing their lips
together, kissing her chastely at first. Naga moaned
hungrily, her tongue pressing against Lina&#39;s lips and
sliding into the other woman&#39;s mouth, dueling with her
own.

&quot;Please don&#39;t say no,&quot; Lina managed breathlessly once
they finally broke the kiss.

Naga&#39;s hands gently held Lina by the shoulders, her
great breasts rising and falling with her panting
breaths. &quot;Do you think I&#39;m mad?&quot; she asked, her eyes
smoky.

&quot;I know I&#39;m mad for you,&quot; Lina answered, pressing her
mouth to the tender flesh of Naga&#39;s throat. Her hands
grasped at Naga&#39;s breasts, giving in to a desire that
had plagued her since she had seen Naga bathing so
long ago.

Naga mewled softly as her nipples were pulled, the
flesh of her breasts pulled up and out. Lina licked
down, tasting salty flesh before finding the breasts
and sucking hungrily. &quot;Gods Lina,&quot; Naga moaned, &quot;I&#39;ve
wanted this....&quot;

Naga&#39;s hands roamed wildly across Lina&#39;s back,
tangling in and pulling on her hair when Lina reached
a sensitive spot. Lina felt hands slide down, grasping
her by the bottom and squeezing wildly. A hand slipped
down and Lina spread her legs, fingers gliding across
slick wetness.

&quot;You&#39;re bold,&quot; Lina gasped out as she shifted, turning
her body to give those questing fingers better access.
A low moan came as fingers slid inside, teasingly only
a tiny bit to slid out again to circle her clit.

Naga moaned as Lina let her own hands explore, sliding
down across the flat belly to that delicate triangle,
then down to touch soaked flesh. &quot;No more than you,&quot;
Naga gasped as Lina stroked along the outer lips, the
gently ventured inside.

Almost as one fingers moved deeper, both women laying
closely together as they experienced the quivering of
excited breaths, the shudders of their passionate
bodies. Lina met Naga&#39;s eyes, her own heat shining in
hers as they gave in to passion, hands moving faster
as they quacked, fighting back cries that would have
alerted the entire inn to what they were doing there.

&quot;Aeiih!&quot; Naga groaned out as she came, splashing
against Lina&#39;s fingers, Lina&#39;s choked off moan of
completion following soon after.

They lay there silently, sweat drying on them as they
lay so close together. &quot;Thank you,&quot; Lina finally said,
kissing Naga again much more gently than before.

&quot;It was my pleasure,&quot; Naga sighed happily.

Lina lay there in Naga&#39;s arms, feeling slightly
embarrassed that her mind was already racing to
consider other things they might do. A sigh, &quot;I love
you, Naga.&quot;

&quot;And I you,&quot; Naga agreed. A moment&#39;s silence then Naga
asked huskily, &quot;Do you want to do it again?&quot;

Lina just chuckled softly.</pre>
