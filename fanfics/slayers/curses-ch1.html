<h1>Curses and Control (part 1 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hawk.html">Hawk Shadowharper</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;The way to truly defeat Lina Inverse is to make her feel she&#39;s lost
control of herself, to make her do things she doesn&#39;t want to do, or
doesn&#39;t think she normally would do. Her self control is what makes her
powerful. Remove that, and you can defeat her.&quot;

The place was dark, always shadowy. The only indication of life was two
darker shadows standing around a small orb. In the orb was an image of
the mentioned sorceress. &quot;Do you understand?&quot; The second shadow bowed its
head.

&quot;Yes, my Lord, and I have the perfect spell in mind.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some say that food is a delicacy. Some say that one should enjoy their
food, savor its flavor and enjoy it completely. The heros of our story
would like to disagree.

&quot;Path tha ickin is ay.&quot; Anyone that hasn&#39;t know the red head long
wouldn&#39;t have a clue as to what she just said. The others she was sitting
with, though, know her rather well. A chicken made its way down the table
until vanishing into Lina&#39;s mouth.

Sitting across from her, food was meeting the same demise at Gourry&#39;s
hands. Next to the sorceress, Zel was sipping his usual cup of coffee,
watching the blond girl seated across from him. Seraya was eyeing the
rather large portion (well, for her anyway) of food she received and
poking at it with her fork.

&quot;Something wrong with the food, Ser?&quot; She looked up at him and smiled
lightly, causing him to blush slightly. &lt;How immature can I get, it&#39;s just
a little smile.&gt;

&quot;No... just I don&#39;t normally eat a lot.&quot; Zel nodded, glancing at the
rapidly-disappearing feast between Lina and Gourry.

&quot;Hang around these two long enough and you won&#39;t anyway.&quot; He ducked the
fireball launched in his direction and took another sip of coffee as if
nothing had happened. Ser giggled quietly.

After the various big eaters had finished, it was dark and time for bed.
There seemed to be a problem, though. &quot;WHAT DO YOU MEAN THERE&#39;RE ONLY TWO
ROOMS LEFT?!&quot; The innkeeper gulped, knowing who Lina was and what she
could do. However, that wouldn&#39;t change how pressed for space he was.

&quot;Please forgive me, Ms. Inverse, but all I have are two single occupancy
rooms left.&quot; Lina sighed and grumbled lowly, then looked back at the
other three.

&quot;Fine, guess we&#39;ll have to share. Zel, you and Gourry go in one and Ser
and I will take the other.&quot; The others nodded and they all headed
upstairs, the girls disappearing into one room and the guys in the other.

Each room had only one bed, and it wasn&#39;t even a double size. &quot;Uhm,
Zelgadis? I can sleep on the floor if you want.&quot; Zel looked at the
swordsman and shook his head.

&quot;If you do, traveling tomorrow will be torture. We&#39;ll just have to
share.&quot;

&quot;Oh, okay,&quot; Gourry agreed as he rapidly set his armor down beside the bed
and climbed into bed. Zel sweatdropped, draping his cloak over a chair
then laying down as well, as far on the edge as he could.

Considering the size of the blanket, this did not work well as both men
fought for enough to cover themselves. Zel grumbled, &quot;You don&#39;t need to
hog the blanket along with the food.&quot; He gave another tug on the strained
fabric which Gourry immediately pulled back.

&quot;But I&#39;m barely even covered!&quot; Zel sighed and stopped fighting.

&quot;Fine, then we&#39;ll have to move closer together.&quot; He rolled backwards to
laying on his back, and Gourry did the same. They were shoulder to
shoulder, and now they were both covered. &quot;There, better?&quot;

&quot;Zzzz...&quot; Zel would&#39;ve facefaulted had he not already been on his back,
but then fell asleep as well. &lt;The bed *is* comfortable, actually...&gt;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lina sighed contently to herself, wrapped up in the comfortable blanket.
&lt;This isn&#39;t so bad, I can&#39;t even tell Ser&#39;s in the bed.&gt; Something clicked
in her mind and she blinked. There was a very slight movement coming from
something on the bed and she could just barely feel it.

&quot;Seraya? What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;... N-nothing, Lina-san...&quot; She turned over and looked at Ser in the
darkness. Lina could see that the blond girl was balled up on the bed and
shivering.

&quot;Ser, you&#39;re shivering,&quot; Lina said quietly, preparing a low level
fireball to warm her up.

&quot;I.. I&#39;m alright, Lina-san...&quot; The sorceress frowned. &lt;I didn&#39;t leave her
any of the blanket, did I...&gt;

&quot;Aww, I&#39;m sorry, Seraya.&quot; Lina reached over and gently wrapped an arm
around Ser&#39;s waist. The younger girl blushed softly but didn&#39;t resist as
Lina pulled her closer. After making sure the blanket was over them both,
Lina hugged Ser around the waist again, the smaller girl&#39;s back to her
chest.

&quot;T-thank you, Lina-san,&quot; Ser whispered weakly. Lina smiled and hugged her
tighter, making Ser blush deeper.

&quot;Any time, Ser-san, any time.&quot; Both girls fell asleep as well, more
comfortable together than they would be apart.
