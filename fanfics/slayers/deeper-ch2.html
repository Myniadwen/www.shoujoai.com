<h1>Deeper Than The Surface (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/onlyyuri.html">Only Yuri</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../slayers/deeper-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Sylphiel&#39;s heart stopped. &lt;No, she can&#39;t be joking, I&#39;ve never seen
Lina so serious before.&gt; Her eyes lowered from Lina&#39;s face to one spot
on the wood table. Her hands fell from the tabletop to her lap. She
closed her eyes for a second, then opened them again, trying to blink
away tears. The silence was a thick cloud that had descended upon the
table. The suffocating atmosphere in the restaurant was intensified a
tenfold because it was completely empty. Lina looked away Sylphiel, and
now she could clearly see the wet streaks on Lina&#39;s face.

&quot;When...&quot; Sylphiel nearly choked, &quot;when...did this happen? &lt;What&gt;
happened?&quot;

Lina didn&#39;t speak for a while. Then, as if just realizing the question,
she answered a terse, &quot;Five days ago.&quot;

&quot;And what happened?&quot;

&quot;Things. We were secretly following a sorcerer who said to someone else
that he knew where some hidden treasure was. Gourry...Gourry actually
told me that he had a bad feeling about this. It&#39;s my fault that he&#39;s
dead!&quot; Lina blinked away more tears. &quot;The sorcerer had some sort of
medallion with special powers...he must have known that we were
following him and...he chanted something, but I couldn&#39;t hear, and
then, a bright light came from the medallion. By then, my powers were
all gone; it how somehow &lt;absorbed&gt; it. I remember the sorcerer&#39;s exact
words: &#39;Without your powers, you will have no possible chance of
defeating me. I intend to kill you, Lina Inverse. With this medallion,
I will continue to absorb you until it was like you never even
existed.&#39; I could already feel myself being drawn towards the light.
Gourry must have seen how weak I had become and decided to...sacrifice
himself. I couldn&#39;t do anything else, I couldn&#39;t think, I just...I just
ran.&quot; At this point, Lina simply put her head down.

Sylphiel just sat still, worries that any movement on her part would
send Lina over the edge. Then she heard Lina quietly mumble something
like, &quot;I don&#39;t want to live anymore...&quot;

Her heart froze again. &lt;What?! Please tell me Lina didn&#39;t just say what
she just said.&gt; She shook her head viciously. &lt;That&#39;s ridiculous! We&#39;d
be damned if the most powerful sorceress wanted to die. No. I must
convince her in some way that she &lt;must not die!&gt; I&#39;ve never seen her
broken...this isn&#39;t the strong and confident Lina I&#39;ve always known.
She almost died once, and I&#39;m going to save her again&gt;.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to hear it.&quot; Sylphiel stated, almost to herself.

&quot;What?&quot; Lina lifted her head three inches to look at Sylphiel.

&quot;I said, I DON&#39;T WANT TO HEAR IT!&quot; She stood, and slammed both palms on
the table.

				 ~*~

Her figure stood imposingly over Lina, as her shadow reached across the
table. Lina looked up at the older woman, and could not remember when
she had made her so mad before.

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare even &lt;think&gt; about taking your own life, Lina! I know you
loved him, deeply, even thought you never admitted it, but...&quot; her
voice softened, &quot;he would have wanted you to live your life to the
fullest, with or without him, because he had a kind heart. And he loved
you. The way he looked at you contrasted so deeply to when he saw me
again for the first time in years. He only remembered me as the girl
&#39;who cooks good!&#39; and he went after you when your body was taken over
by the Lord of Nightmares. Lina, there are so many people who love you
for who you truly are. You make a great impact on the lives of people
around you. True, sometimes it may not be for the better, but it is an
impact that is positive in the long run. Lina, please keep in mind of
what I&#39;ve said. All of us are your family; I, Gourry, Amelia, Mister
Zelgadiss, even Xelloss, if it&#39;s to a lesser degree. You can&#39;t give up
on us and our memories together.&quot; Lina pondered over this last phrase.
But her mind could not focus completely on anything. She stood,
blinked, then swayed; thrown off balance by a wave of dizziness. So
both young women stood, one was looking down at the table, and the
other was almost glaring at her company. Then, Sylphiel&#39;s face
softened, and she asked, &quot;Lina...are you all right?&quot;

Lina didn&#39;t know if she nodded at that point, because all her fatigue
she had accumulated by not sleeping each might had finally caught up to
her. But Sylphiel was already there; ready to catch her. Sylphiel
picked her up, carried her, and realized just how heavy the smaller
sorceress could be.

&lt;And she just ate, too&gt;.

Slowly, Sylphiel climbed the steps back up to Lina&#39;s room in the inn.

				 ~*~

Sylphiel watched her while she slept. Once, when Sylphiel was drowsing,
she woke up to hear Lina moaning something in her sleep. It sounded
like, &quot;Gourry...come back...please...&quot; Lina had tossed in her bed; the
blankets lay recklessly around the small bedroom. Sylphiel saw that she
was sweating profusely. She felt her own forehead and Lina&#39;s, found
that it was hotter than was usual. Quickly, she wet a towel found in
the bathroom and wet it with cold water. After placing it on Lina&#39;s
forehead, she softly murmured a Recovery on Lina&#39;s body. And there she
stayed for the rest of the night.

Lina was so tired she did not awaken until mid-afternoon. She found the
damp cloth on her head and pulled it off. She was wondering why she
felt so weak when Sylphiel suddenly popped into the room with
breakfast. From the looks of it however, Sylphiel had to drag herself
from under the weight of the laden platter she was carrying. Lina tried
to lift herself to help, but she was surprised to find herself falling
back. Sylphiel gently arranged the pillows behind her so she could sit
up. All the while she was doing this; Lina stared at her. &lt;*Why is she
doing all this for me? Doesn&#39;t she hate me for letting Gourry sacrifice
himself for me? Does she want something from me? An apology? An apology
for ruining her chances with Gourry?*&gt; When Sylphiel moved forward once
again to fix her pillows, Lina grasped her arm.

&quot;Why are you doing all of this?&quot;

Sylphiel looked into Lina&#39;s eyes and noticed for the first time the
ruby intensity of them.

&quot;I&#39;m trying to help you,&quot; she answered with gritted teeth, because she
knew Lina wouldn&#39;t accept her help willingly.

&quot;Why?&quot; Lina persisted, still holding unto Sylphiel&#39;s arm.

But Sylphiel wretched her arm free. &quot;I try to help you and this is the
thanks I get?!&quot; But then she softened; knowing Lina didn&#39;t need someone
to yell at her now.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Lina, but I need to take care of you, at least for a few
days.&quot; With that, she simply walked away and out the door to get what
Lina assumed to be more food.

Lina, meanwhile, went through Sylphiel&#39;s actions in her head. &lt;The only
thing I can remember from yesterday...Sylphiel&#39;s big speech about her
influence on other people...&gt; For once, Lina seemed embarrassed of
herself. Then she remembered a key phrase. &quot;&#39;All of us are your
family; I, Gourry, Amelia...&#39;&quot; Lina closed her eyes, and leaned back
fully on the pillows. &lt;*But my real family, my parents, my sister...*&gt;
She shuddered. &lt;*They&#39;re all gone in my mind. They left no memory that
I could cherish. The only memories I have are the ones with Gourry,
Sylphiel, Amelia, and Zel. They are all...my life.*&gt; She silently made
a resolution to keep her memories forever. She looked upward, at the
ceiling, and for the first time in six days, smiled.

Sylphiel came in, indeed carrying another platter of steaming food.

&quot;I thought you would have left by now...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Sylphiel stopped briefly from setting up the food and looked up at
Lina.

&quot;I&#39;m...sorry?&quot;

&quot;Yes...for...for making you worry about me Sylphiel...I realized...that
even though he&#39;s gone, he&#39;s still here...in my heart. I just hope he&#39;s
got good food up there...&quot; Lina looked up once again to the ceiling, a
hand on her heart.

&quot;Lina...&quot;

Lina looked back at Sylphiel, who had tears in her eyes, and had come
closer to stand next to the bed.

&quot;Sylphiel?&quot;

Suddenly, and without warning, Sylphiel pulled Lina into a deep and
bone-crushing hug. Lina was surprised; she hasn&#39;t expected this must
power from Sylphiel, someone who dealt with White Magic. Slowly, Lina
put her arms around Sylphiel, and she felt a tear drop on her shoulder.
&quot;You&#39;ve finally come back to me...&quot; Sylphiel whispered.

A confused looked crossed Lina&#39;s face when they finally released each
other.

In order to answer Lina&#39;s look, Sylphiel told her, &quot;I&#39;ve lost everyone
I&#39;ve ever loved. My family, Gourry, but I&#39;m not about to lose you,
too.&quot; She placed a hand on Lina&#39;s cheek kissed her lightly.

She then stopped the kiss, and faced a bewildered Lina.

Lina sat there, her whole body tense as she replayed in her mind what
just happened, the cooling food forgotten. Sylphiel&#39;s face turned into
dismay as she realized that Lina would not acknowledge her feelings for
her. Her hand slipped from Lina&#39;s cheek and onto the bed. She slowly
straightened, and was about to leave again when she felt a hand placed
on hers. Sylphiel turned to find that Lina&#39;s head was down; her eyes
obscured by the shadows of her bangs.

&quot;Please don&#39;t...leave me...&quot; She said gently, just like she did when
she first saw Sylphiel in the inn. When she spoke, Sylphiel could hear
the telltale whimper of tears in her voice. She slowly stepped back to
Lina&#39;s side.

Lina slowly brought up Sylphiel&#39;s hand to where she could feel her
heart beating. An unspoken understanding came between them, and they
shared another kiss, more powerful than the last.
