<h1>Upon the Sea of Chaos (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../slayers/index.html">Slayers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mysticmew.html">MysticMew</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Important Note: I have not yet fully decided, if I&#39;ll make my first 
attempt on an (English) Buffy/Willow shipper or a Buffy/Willow/Tara 
one, what I do with Sylphiel and Gourry is basically decided on that. 
I would like to have your feedback while I develop the story on what 
to do.

Foreword

Well (with all the fiction I&#39;ve been writing and probably never 
finishing *sigh*), I finally decided to put this into motion after I 
had some good time to dwell on the idea of a &quot;Slayer/Slayers&quot; fusion. 
The idea has formed while watching Slayers actually and learning of 
Willow&#39;s fall into addiction through a lot of fics on the 
Buffy/Willow-lists (Season 6 has not started here yet, most likely in 
Autumn). The basic difference there I thought was; BtVS Black Magic: 
Gah, bad, destructive, chaos, EVIL we don&#39;t want that. Slayers Black 
Magic: Well okay, it&#39;s demon based but doesn&#39;t have to be necessarily 
used for evil if controlled. Now tell me, what would have become of 
Willow, if someone taught her to get a grip on the Black Magic stuff 
and control it (like Lina... err, most of the time at least)? A lot 
of inspiration on this point also came from Hunter&#39;s Red Moon Series.
So, before I go babbling and giving everything away before writing, 
here it goes.

Prologue: Dimensional Chaos

(Lina)
The air around us was thick and filled with utter destruction, its 
source directly in front of us, ready to whisk us away from the face 
of earth. I was so not going to let this damned dragon do this. 
Granted he had a point that this countless battles were pointless, 
that the question of why the war between Dragons and Mazoku had to be 
was a verified one. But destroying the whole of creation, resetting 
the evolutionary circle, hoping for a better life? This was crazy and 
I think deep down he knows it. The world needs a certain amount of 
Chaos to stabilize the Order. Without Chaos mankind would stagnate 
and die much quicker. And what did Valgaarv think gave us the 
confirmation that the next world would indeed be different, that the 
Lady would not simply repeat the whole thing all over again? It was 
ridiculous! Even when they managed to destroy this world and the 
other three, did they really think they could rebel against their 
creator? I did not think so and as an at least somewhat avatar of the 
Lord of Nightmares I also KNEW so. Now, when this blasted things 
would just work again
	I stared down at the bracelets and wondered for the 
thousand&#39;s time in the last minutes why I could not cast the Giga 
Slave. Sure, I was not actually thrilled with another encounter of 
death or being possessed by the most powerful being, the creator 
herself. But looking up at Filia again who was still debating with 
herself, whether she wanted or not wanted to alginate with Xellos to 
fulfill the prophecy, I was hard-pressed to believe that the Giga 
Slave might be the better solution than her own prophecy.
	Just as the Golden Dragon and former priestess seemed to have 
reached a decision, everything went into utter chaos. Without warning 
Valgaarv unleashed a powerful blast of magic into our rows, 
scattering the formation we had tried to form. Zelgadis, Gourry and 
Sirius had all the presence of mind to jump or levitate out the way 
but Amelia was still staying directly in the path of the destructive 
force. From experience I knew fully well that it would be too late 
for her but I cried out anyway: &quot;AMELIA, WATCH OUT!&quot; With wide eyes 
and clenched fists I watched the blast making impact and hurling 
Amelia, who had attempted a half-heartily attempt on a shield, high 
into the air, her weapon flying from her hand, the light energy 
winking out immediately. I darted forward in a futile attempt to 
somehow save my friend but was halted by another magic bolt that just 
barely passed by me, only to engulf an equally distracted and 
surprised Xellos, disintegrating him on the spot. A second later 
Amelia landed hard against cold stone, head first and blood flowing 
freely.
	I felt my stomach lurch at the sight and my heart clenched. 
Amelia was one of my oldest companions. Companions that had become 
friends. Friends that had become even more on the long run. There was 
Gourry, yes, but I still didn&#39;t really know what I felt about him nor 
was I going to admit it. Amelia though was always a loyal and good 
friend, even if we often fought over pathetic things, even if she 
aggravated me to no end with her justice attitude sometimes. I smiled 
at that, remembering some of her worse stunts. It was a sad smile and 
the nostalgic feeling was quickly stomped on as I focused back on the 
tattered mess of the girl I considered a really close friend. If 
anyone, Amelia did not deserve this.
	&quot;Filia, help her,&quot; I said through clenched teeth, my fists 
vibrating with a cold fury. Xellos was dead, Amelia close to it - if 
not already and I didn&#39;t even want to think of that - and we would 
follow soon. Valgaarv had gone too far. He had crossed a line, where 
I wouldn&#39;t, couldn&#39;t forgive anymore. Filia, still in a state of 
frozen shock at what her hesitation had caused, hadn&#39;t moved, her 
eyes were on me, frightened and scared, unsure what to do. I wasn&#39;t 
going to have any of that right now. Her insecurity had caused Amelia 
her present state and she was going to fix it.
	&quot;NOW!&quot; I growled and the former priestess actually jumped, 
nodded quickly and hurried to Amelia&#39;s side. I made sure that she 
reached her and that Zelgadis and Gourry were keeping watch, while 
she applied her dragon magic, praying to myself that she would make 
it. Then I finally glanced up to Valgaarv, I think I saw him 
flinching under my gaze, even if the emotionless smile still was 
there. He really didn&#39;t care anymore. Well, so did I.
	I gripped the bow that had fallen not far from me tightly and 
concentrated. The first time I invoked the magic of the creator,  I 
had cast it on the Sword of Light, one of the five weapons of the 
Dark Star and it didn&#39;t kill me back then. Still, Sylphiel and the 
Clair Bible&#39;s warning were all very much present in my mind as was 
what my friends reluctantly told me about my possession while 
fighting Fibrizo. It was a risk, more for me than the world since it 
would be destroyed anyway. &quot;May the creator have mercy with me...&quot; I 
whispered and held up the bow, invoking the power of light.
	&quot;Darkness beyond blackest pitch, deeper than the deepest 
night!&quot; Valgaarv/Dark Star actually hesitated as the blinding vortex 
of chaos power began to swirl around me. The arrowhead began 
absorbing the power and turning into nothingness. &quot;Lord of Darkness, 
shining like gold upon the Sea of Chaos, I call upon thee, swear 
myself to thee!&quot; Now the Demon Lord actually recoiled from the power 
and Valgaarv stared down with wide eyes at the scene beneath 
him. &quot;Let the fools who stand before us be destroyed by the power you 
and I possess!&quot; Valgaarv had began frantically unleashing magic at me 
but it was no use, the chaos storm around me simply absorbed the 
energy and added it to mine. I had to fight very hard for control, 
the urge to simply let the power free reign almost to great to 
withstand. I felt the primal call of destruction, to do what Valgaarv 
attempted himself. But that would not be, this time I would not 
falter. For the sake of the world and especially for Amelia, I would 
pull this off.
	&quot;You can&#39;t be serious! Stop this, that is madness! Do you 
want to end ALL of creation?!?&quot; I ignored Valgaarv&#39;s shouts and 
looked back over my shoulder at my gathered friends. There was a 
mixture of fear and understanding in all of their faces. Even Gourry 
who I had heard yelling at me from behind was quiet and when my gaze 
fell on him, he just briefly nodded at a series of unspoken 
questions. I needed him to understand, I needed him to not blame 
himself and I needed him to watch out for Amelia for me. And he did 
so.
	My eyes fell once again on Amelia who was laying on the 
ground, glowing in a faint golden light of healing magic. Her eyes 
were open and met mine with a pleading gaze that made me almost 
consider to just drop the magic - which I wasn&#39;t sure of even being 
possible at this point. I think she mouthed my name and said 
something else that I couldn&#39;t understand, probably begging for me to 
stop. But I couldn&#39;t. Not now, not after what Valgaarv had done to 
everyone. What he had done to HER, for her I would sacrifice my soul 
and the only way to make sure she was safe most likely involved this 
aspect.
	The realization of how deep my feelings for the young 
princess ran startled me but the absolute clarity behind them, began 
to make sense now. I didn&#39;t know how or why, not even when or if it 
was returned but it was so simple now. The clarity before death...
	Smiling a sad smile in her direction, I faced Valgaarv once 
again and didn&#39;t bother to answer any of his pathetic demands as I 
concentrated all remaining power on the talisman of light, making the 
arrow pulsate with chaos magic. &quot;GIGA SLAVE!&quot; Closing my eyes, I let 
the arrow go and the enormous, straining power leave me with the 
force of a sonic boom. Left drained and empty, I failed to notice the 
swirling gate of white light popping into existence the moment the 
Giga Slave literally impaled Dark Star/Valgaarv...

(Willow)
I heard Dawn&#39;s screams for her sister before I actually saw the 
horror happening above. Still cradling a scared and shivering Tara in 
my arms I barely caught Buffy diving right into the dimensional 
gates, which was opened moments before from the blood of her own 
sister - The Key. My heart threatened to burst right on the spot. 
What was she doing there? She couldn&#39;t go, she shouldn&#39;t leave! I had 
just gotten Tara back but for what price?
	&quot;Darkness beyond blackest pitch, deeper than the deepest 
night!&quot;
	Time seemed to stop or at least slow down considerably as I 
watched my best friend, my confidence, the person who made me what I 
am today, vanishing into the spiraling pool of light. &quot;Buffy,&quot; I 
rasped out staring at the sky, waiting for the miracle to occur. 
There always was a miracle. Buffy wouldn&#39;t die, she never did, we all 
came through in the end. That&#39;s how it was supposed to be. I waited 
and waited... and waited... and continued waiting.
	&quot;Lord of Darkness, shining like gold upon the Sea of Chaos, I 
call upon thee, swear myself to thee!&quot;
	&quot;She&#39;s gone, Willow,&quot; Tara&#39;s own sad voice whispered and the 
words were like a sharp knife rammed right through my heart and soul 
alike, sending me into a state of denial. &quot;No, no. She can&#39;t be dead! 
Buffy always survives! Always!&quot; I cried out, shaking my head, then 
throwing it back and shouting to the heavens. &quot;Do you hear me? 
ALWAYS!&quot; There was no answer, just the flashing of the gateway. One 
time, a second time... No sign from Buffy, the Slayer was gone. If I 
hadn&#39;t been holding Tara, I surely would have broken down by now, so 
I just cried tears of anguish and soul-shattering tears, soaking 
Tara&#39;s clothing wet.
	&quot;Let the fools who stand before us be destroyed by the power 
you and I possess!&quot;
	There was so much I hadn&#39;t told her, so much I still had to 
share with the one person who had the most striking influence on my 
life. &quot;No...&quot; I whispered. &quot;Oh Goddess, please no...&quot; I felt Tara&#39;s 
arms around me but even she wasn&#39;t able to take away the pain. I had 
saved her from Glory, just to lose the second - no, the prime 
important person in my life. The vortex flashed a third time and then 
there was a loud boom, accompanied by a shrill cry of power and rage 
echoing over the deafening noise. &quot;GIGA SLAVE!&quot; I realized the low 
whisper I had thought to imagine had to be a spell incantation of 
some sort. When something came through the portal which was closing 
right behind it. At first I really believed it to be Buffy but 
quickly realized to my bitter disappointment that what passed through 
was, though definitely human and even female, someone different.
	I could make out orange-red hair and something resembling a 
black cloak through my tear-stained eyes before a shrill, cursing 
shriek echoed through the night&#39;s air, followed by a quick and 
desperately hopeful: &quot;RAYWING!&quot; For a moment nothing seemed to happen 
before a faint aura of... magical wind flickered into existence, 
lowering the girl gently to the ground.
	&quot;What?&quot; I asked lamely and helped Tara to her feet - or was 
Tara helping me up? Either way we slowly approached the girl on the 
ground and noticed the others doing likewise. For a moment we stood 
over the form the teenage girl, maybe slightly younger than us which 
did not betray the signs of maturity, however. There was a long 
silence, before anyone spoke. &quot;What&#39;s up with the white hair?&quot;
	Typical Xander behavior to master such situations although I 
had to admit that was odd. Tara confirmed my suspicion a second 
later. &quot;Magical backlash. What-Whatever she did, it to-took a lot out 
of her.&quot; I frowned and studied the girl a bit closer, even if only 
for the reason to stop my heart from jumping wildly 
around. &quot;Powerful... Black magic, I guess, can still feel it in the 
air... Though the levitation or whatever was not...&quot; Tara&#39;s embrace 
tightened and Giles nodded in confirmation. I looked at him with 
pleading eyes. &quot;What about... Buffy... Is she...?&quot; I trailed off and 
saw the ex-watcher squirming under my gaze.
	Finally he sighed somewhat exasperated - he didn&#39;t even 
bother to clear his glasses! &quot;Willow, would you please calm down and 
think rationally for one moment, you would come to a more relieving, 
even if not really satisfying conclusion.&quot; As I continued to stare at 
him blankly and tried to wrap my mind around whatever he wanted to 
tell me, Giles sighed yet again. &quot;Think, Willow, we all saw the girl 
come out of the vortex and we know The Key opens a gate to all 
dimensions. Normally I would share your fear that Buffy left us but 
my guess is that somehow the dimension the young lady here came from, 
is connected to ours, probably during similar important events and 
brought the girl here. Which would mean that Buffy...&quot;
	&quot;Is in the other dimension? I had this figured out already. 
Why do you tell us something that ob...&quot; Anya stopped in mid-
sentence, when she received a group glare. I looked back at Giles, my 
hope rising already. &quot;You think she&#39;s alive?&quot; I asked meekly. &quot;Quite 
so. We just need to figure out where she is and how we get her back.&quot; 
I doubted the simplicity of this course of action but let myself 
relax into my lovers arms. Giles was right. I was an idiot for not 
thinking rationally.
	&quot;Easy, Will, it&#39;s normal to react like that, especially after 
what you&#39;ve gone through,&quot; Tara reassured me. I didn&#39;t answer but 
simply closed my eyes, relishing in the feeling of my once again sane 
girlfriend&#39;s arms. I noticed Spike leading a distraught though 
equally confused and hopeful Dawn down the tower, while Xander picked 
up the unconscious girl, for once not receiving a jealous look or any 
comment from Anya. &quot;Let&#39;s go home.&quot;
	I looked back at the tower, where we had minutes ago fought 
our probably hardest and worst battle ever and nodded silently. Buffy 
might be gone, but she was not dead. Now that I could think logically 
again, I simply knew it with a surprising clarity. If Buffy was to be 
dead, I would have felt it. She was alright, somewhere.
