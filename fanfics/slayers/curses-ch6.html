<a href="../slayers/curses-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Zel kept running through the woods, Gourry right behind him. The
swordsman had regained consciousness right after Ser had disappeared, and
was pulled off into the forest, lots of questions kept unasked. &quot;We&#39;ll
need Lina&#39;s help to get Seraya back.&quot;

&quot;Someone dared take my Ser-chan,&quot; Xel grumbled lowly, flying alongside
Zel. &quot;They&#39;ll learn not to mess with me.&quot; Zel ignored him, more intent on
just trying to find Lina.

&quot;Where&#39;s Lina,&quot; Gourry finally asked. Zel sighed quietly, jumping over a
fallen tree and continuing deeper into the forest.

&quot;We&#39;re looking for her, once we find her we can find Seraya.&quot; Instead of
getting answer, the blond only got more questions.

Several minutes, they fuond her, curled up against a tree and sitting
nearly motionless. &quot;Lina?&quot; She didn&#39;t look up, and it wasn&#39;t until Zel
shook her shoulder that she saw them for the first time.

&quot;Wha..?! What is it?&quot; She blinked a couple times, trying to clear her
head.

&quot;Someone took Ser-chan,&quot; Xel replied bitterly, anger seeping into his
normally cheerful voice.

&quot;... Took her...&quot; Lina looked down, shame nearly overwhelming her again.
&quot;...She wouldn&#39;t want my help,&quot; she said quietly. Zel sighed to himself,
wondering what it would take to get Lina to feel better.

&quot;Lina, last night wasn&#39;t your doing, Ser said it was because of a control
spell.&quot; Lina looked back up at the chimera, red eyes thoughtful a moment
but still sorrowful.

&quot;... Even so, I still...&quot;

&quot;Lina, she&#39;s a forgiving person. This isn&#39;t the time to be concerned
about what happened, we can&#39;t save her without you.&quot; Lina sighed quietly,
closing her eyes a moment.

&lt;Even if she hates me now... I need to help save her, she doesn&#39;t deserve
being held against her will anymore than I&#39;ve done...&gt; She opened her eyes
again and nodded slightly. &quot;Let&#39;s find her.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Xelloss opened his eyes and smiled darkly. &quot;I&#39;ve got her, let&#39;s go.&quot; In
an instant, Xel had teleported the group through dimensions, into
darkness.

&quot;Ah, I wondered when you would show up.&quot; The slayers looked around for
the source when a dark figure appeared. &quot;Welcome.. yes, welcome to my
home.&quot;

&quot;Cut the pleasantries and give us Ser-chan back!&quot; Xel glared daggers at
the red-headed man.

&quot;I see... you&#39;re here for my dear Seraya, hm... but what if she doesn&#39;t
want to leave?&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; Zur smiled knowingly and glanced over his shoulder, another
shadowy figure appearing.

&quot;Seraya, you have visitors.&quot; The figure walked towards them and
eventually formed into Seraya dressed in a rather revealing dark blue
dress. The strangest part of it was that there wasn&#39;t even a blush on her
face.

Xel and the others all stared in either shock or.. something else, but
the Trickster was first to recover. &quot;Come on, Ser-chan, let&#39;s go.&quot;

&quot;But I don&#39;t want to go,&quot; she whispered and was surrounded by Zur&#39;s arms,
blank eyes glowing lightly.

&quot;As I told you...&quot; Zur started, nuzzling Ser&#39;s hair affectionately. Even
higher levels of anger rose in Xelloss.

&lt;The bastard has another control spell!&gt; &quot;We&#39;re not leaving without her!&quot;
Lina, Gourry and Zel prepared themselves, a fight wasn&#39;t far off. Zur
just smiled at them.

&quot;What makes you think you&#39;ll even have the choice? Granite, come here.&quot; A
third figure appeared, revealing a black-haired man with gray eyes.

&quot;Yes, my Lord?&quot; Zur watched the intruders thoughtfully, slowly running
his fingers through Ser&#39;s hair.

&quot;My angel and I don&#39;t want to be disturbed. Would you be kind enough to
keep our... &#39;guests&#39; occupied?&quot; Granite grinned, eyes flashing evilly.

&quot;It will be my pleasure, my Lord.&quot; Zur nodded and disappeared with
Seraya. Xel growled lowly.

&quot;Ser-chan!&quot; He narrowed his eyes, the smile long missing from his face as
he held his staff in both hands. Granite&#39;s grin remained, dark energy
starting to swirl around his hands.

&quot;Now... who wishes to die?&quot;
